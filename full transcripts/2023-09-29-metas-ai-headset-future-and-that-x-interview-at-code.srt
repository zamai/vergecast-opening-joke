Speaker 3:  combining decades of medical experience caring for diverse

00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,910
Speaker 3:  communities with the power of data science to one day get

5
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,990

16
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,050
Speaker 5:  doing The, Code, Conference. And what I said to David right before I started

17
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,020
Speaker 5:  is I've hosted enough things. So David, can you just drive

18
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,700
Speaker 5:  this? I'll just sink back into being a guest. Yeah, that seems

20
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,030
Speaker 4:  I like this for you. You've moved, you've done code. You get to like be a

21
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,700
Speaker 4:  person now. This is very exciting. Yeah.

22
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,550
Speaker 5:  Just re blind reacting to things. This episode of the verse has it

23
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,980
Speaker 5:  many ways. The entire theme is Neli Reacts.

24
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,390
Speaker 4:  This episode's gonna be very fun. 'cause the first half is stuff that you

25
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,110
Speaker 4:  know about and the second half is stuff you don't know anything about. It's

26
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,430
Speaker 4:  gonna be great. Alex Cranz is here. Hi Alex.

27
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,430
Speaker 6:  I didn't know I was doing this podcast until about five minutes ago. I'm

28
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:02,910
Speaker 6:  very excited to

29
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,910
Speaker 4:  Be here. I knocked on both of your doors and I said, it's podcast time. And

30
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,470
Speaker 4:  here we go. I was

31
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,250
Speaker 6:  Like, okay, put on some pants. We're here. Let's go.

32
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,690
Speaker 4:  We a lot to talk about. This week Meta Connect was this week we got a bunch

33
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,550
Speaker 4:  of news about ai, all kinds of stuff going on. New Raspberry Pi, which I'm

34
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,710
Speaker 4:  weirdly excited about. macOS Sonoma is this week. We have more, by

35
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,720
Speaker 5:  The way, I just bought a Raspberry Pi for Did I'm fucking idiot, but like,

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,860
Speaker 5:  it'll be fine. It was, it was really cheap. Yeah.

37
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,820
Speaker 4:  Yeah. As a like smart home sensor or whatever the four Will will do.

38
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,870
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like how you immediately guessed what I was using it for.

39
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,750
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Listen, you just moved house. It's not unclear. We have big

40
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,910
Speaker 4:  trials going on all over the place. We're gonna talk a little bit about those

41
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,590
Speaker 4:  today and we're gonna talk a bunch about those next week. But let's start

42
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,870
Speaker 4:  with code. Code was the, we've been working up to code for months. There

43
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,530
Speaker 4:  was a ton going on. We booked a ton of guests. We talked a ton of people.

44
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,150
Speaker 4:  It got real weird right at the end. Oh yeah. Neli, you

45
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,110
Speaker 4:  co-hosted this thing. Congratulations. You made it through. You're back.

46
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,510
Speaker 4:  Seemed like it went really well. Should we start at the end? Can we start

47
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,220
Speaker 4:  anywhere other than Linda?

48
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,160
Speaker 5:  Look, we, here is my goal at Code. This is how I booked everybody. I

49
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,400
Speaker 5:  know everybody thinks about Kara when they think of code because Kara is

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,320
Speaker 5:  Kara and she has run the conference really well for the past couple of

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,910
Speaker 5:  years. The conferences I started going to is a little

52
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,640
Speaker 5:  baby that changed my career around, were

53
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,200
Speaker 5:  hosted by Walt in Kara. Right. All the, the

54
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,080
Speaker 5:  things Steve jobs on stage at Code, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,640
Speaker 5:  on stage, which by the way has, its like a lore and drama behind

56
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,480
Speaker 5:  it. That's Walt I and like, I just don't like it's both of them.

57
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,160
Speaker 5:  And I don't mean to detract anything from like Kara, but there's a Walt component

58
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,080
Speaker 5:  there and like I'm on that coaching tree. Like,

59
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,900
Speaker 5:  just to be really clear, like Walt was my mentor. He,

60
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,480
Speaker 5:  we did the podcast together. He was on our staff. Like there's just a, a

61
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,120
Speaker 5:  piece of that that I was thinking about a lot as we were like doing the conference

62
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,440
Speaker 5:  and like making a conference, which is very challenging. And again, I know

63
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,120
Speaker 5:  like Kara did an amazing job with that. That's a high standard to live up

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,400
Speaker 5:  to. Yeah. I I'm not trying to detract from that. I'm just saying everyone

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,880
Speaker 5:  thinks about that. And I was thinking about the before

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,720
Speaker 5:  that, and what I really wanted on stage was to be a product

67
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,260
Speaker 5:  reviewer, was to talk about products. Right. The Walt side of the equation.

68
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,720
Speaker 5:  And we put a lot of products in that stage. I'm like very proud of that.

69
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,200
Speaker 5:  Right. Adobe launched Photoshop for the web. Mike Krieger from

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,500
Speaker 5:  Artifact launched what is effectively a Twitter competitor. There's a bunch

71
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,870
Speaker 5:  we can get to all that. Yeah. But that's like the part of

72
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,760
Speaker 5:  code that, you know, there's a lot of drama. But if you actually

73
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,720
Speaker 5:  look at our conference and you look at how much we talked about Nvidia H

74
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,600
Speaker 5:  100 GPUs on stage. Like we made a tech conference, like a tech

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,720
Speaker 5:  conference and that's pretty cool. And we

76
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,340
Speaker 4:  Got a true detective trailer like this is,

77
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,160
Speaker 5:  And we had a true detective trailer. Yeah. Yeah. Like there was a lot going

78
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Speaker 5:  on at this conference. And then there was like one little bit of chaos, which

79
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,060
Speaker 5:  I will happily talk about,

80
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,560
Speaker 4:  But we should that first. 'cause that continues to be the thing on a lot

81
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,230
Speaker 4:  of people's minds right now. Partly because of

82
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,960
Speaker 4:  what Lindy Akre, the C e O of X talked about on stage. And

83
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,640
Speaker 4:  partly because of just the, I don't know, the scenery around

84
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,320
Speaker 4:  it. The interview you can watch in full on our YouTube channel or on the

85
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,280
Speaker 4:  Decoder podcast. I listened to it while walking my son in

86
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,700
Speaker 4:  a stroller this morning, which is a deeply weird,

87
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,330
Speaker 5:  Oh my, your son is a supervi now That's his Origin

88
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,140
Speaker 5:  story.

89
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,230
Speaker 4:  The like, cognitive dissonance of that was a very strange 45 minutes

90
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,550
Speaker 5:  When I was a wheel Ladd. I heard the sounds of Linda

91
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,840
Speaker 5:  Yaccarino emanating from my father's

92
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,680
Speaker 5:  headset. And now, now I have to destroy

93
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,640
Speaker 5:  humanity to save it.

94
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,960
Speaker 4:  You you can go listen to the interview. It's really interesting. But the,

95
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,760
Speaker 4:  like, the way the interview happened seemed to be as big a

96
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,600
Speaker 4:  thing as anything. 'cause Joel Roth, who used to be, what was his

97
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:39,860
Speaker 4:  job,

98
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,020
Speaker 5:  Tr head of trust and safety at Twitter. He

99
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,480
Speaker 4:  Was a sort of surprise guest early and talked about a lot of the things that

100
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,040
Speaker 4:  Twitter has struggled with over the years. I don't think he broke a huge

101
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,480
Speaker 4:  amount of new ground in terms of like problems we've known about on that

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,100
Speaker 4:  platform for a very long time. But then Linda was sort of forced to answer

103
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,400
Speaker 4:  for a lot of those in a way that she didn't seem super psyched about answering

104
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,830
Speaker 4:  for.

105
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Look, Linda did a shit chop. She did. We can make a lot of

106
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,160
Speaker 5:  excuses and, and like Yol is like a very convenient excuse and like, that's

107
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,400
Speaker 5:  great. She sucked. Like what, what do, what do you want me to say? I interview

108
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,320
Speaker 5:  a lot of CEOs all the time. You can go listen to 'em. Yeah. You know, we

109
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,030
Speaker 5:  don't shy away from hard questions. You know what you get with Kara

110
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,840
Speaker 5:  Swisher, right? Like she did a bad job. Like, and like

111
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,320
Speaker 5:  I, I can talk about the setup there. I just don't want to give her the out.

112
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,000
Speaker 5:  I I think if you're the c e o of a, a major company that is the global town

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,200
Speaker 5:  square, da da da da da da, you better be ready. You

114
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,120
Speaker 4:  Should at least have some numbers I would say about how well you're doing.

115
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,000
Speaker 4:  Instead of, she spent a lot of time not answering questions about

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,240
Speaker 4:  how well are you doing? And instead talking about her feelings about how

117
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,800
Speaker 4:  well they're doing, which we've learned over the years is when you should

118
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,350
Speaker 4:  be really alarmed about how well something is doing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

119
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,520
Speaker 5:  Only get to the setup and Then, we can talk about that. But I, I don't want

120
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,320
Speaker 5:  to for one second, let anyone walk away from this

121
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,800
Speaker 5:  thinking that the setup or the chaos of Yol or whatever the surprise of

122
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,240
Speaker 5:  it should have is an

123
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,140
Speaker 5:  excuse. There. There are lots of choices you can make if you don't wanna

124
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,980
Speaker 5:  be, you could, she could just walked away and she might have, right? Sure.

125
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,870
Speaker 5:  But she chose to be on the stage and all she had to say she stayed

126
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,160
Speaker 5:  alone. She wanted to be on that stage, which is an important piece of puzzle.

127
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,060
Speaker 5:  So lemme just talk about the setup. So as virtual house listeners know, one

128
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,980
Speaker 5:  of our star guests was supposed to be G m C of Mary Bara. And she dropped

129
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,840
Speaker 5:  out because of the strike. And we made a lot of fun at her, the code stage

130
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,540
Speaker 5:  for dropping out because of the strike So. We, you know, there's like a last

131
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,140
Speaker 5:  minute scrambled to replace your guest So. we have, you know, people pay

132
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,900
Speaker 5:  to attend the conference who wanna put on a good good show for them. So.

133
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,860
Speaker 5:  we, we booked the c e o of Rivian, RJ CR, who was great and he was like

134
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,160
Speaker 5:  of she was great. The one-to-one replacement. And we can, I tried so hard

135
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,280
Speaker 5:  to make him talk shit about the cyber shock. We can talk about that. But

136
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,640
Speaker 5:  that's sort of one-to-one replacement. But everyone was like working hard

137
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,100
Speaker 5:  to replace him, including Kara Right. Who had no

138
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,040
Speaker 5:  obligations to this conference, really. But she, you know, she did it. So

139
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,560
Speaker 5:  she was gonna interview John Lovett and I was gonna be like the Kara

140
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,500
Speaker 5:  Comedy show in the middle of our thing to get Kara back on stage. But then

141
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,340
Speaker 5:  she asked y to do it and Yel said yes. And the history of Code and

142
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,940
Speaker 5:  Code is unlike every other conference, every other

143
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,940
Speaker 5:  conference. And David has worked at a lot of media companies. Every other

144
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,740
Speaker 5:  conference gets corrupted by advertising or

145
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,860
Speaker 5:  sales response, like the history of code. And before that, the all things

146
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,900
Speaker 5:  D conference, like Walton Care are like, we're doing whatever you want and

147
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,620
Speaker 5:  you can show up here. And they had the capital to do

148
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,490
Speaker 5:  it. And this is like a, again, like, these are people that I've worked

149
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,030
Speaker 5:  with and around who are my seniors? Me going to their

150
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,220
Speaker 5:  conference when I was like a $12 a post reporter at Eng

151
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,980
Speaker 5:  Gadget. Like that, that stuff is all in my brain. Like I'm taking over

152
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,780
Speaker 5:  this legacy. So our conference is the same, right? We

153
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,060
Speaker 5:  invite people, we say we, you know, we, we have a lot of conversations

154
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,900
Speaker 5:  about, you know, it's a show like to me, interviewing another person. There's

155
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,140
Speaker 5:  prep calls and we'd like chat about what they wanna say and what I wanna

156
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,480
Speaker 5:  say, but they don't get the questions ahead of time. In particular, the most

157
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,120
Speaker 5:  important part of code is audience questions, which Linda refused to

158
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,760
Speaker 5:  take. And there's just an element of chaos, like journalistic chaos that

159
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,620
Speaker 5:  makes code code. It's unlike any other conference for those reasons.

160
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,390
Speaker 5:  And I have texts in my pocket from Walt before the show and after the show

161
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,600
Speaker 5:  reminding me that that is what his conference is all about and what Kara's

162
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,840
Speaker 5:  conference

163
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,700
Speaker 4:  Is all about. Yeah. Yeah. He always used to say, the thing that we do here

164
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,750
Speaker 4:  is journalism,

165
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,120
Speaker 5:  Live journalism. That's the thing that they, and they both said it. Yeah.

166
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,820
Speaker 5:  I just, again, I I I I'm just coming back to the foundations of code.

167
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,680
Speaker 5:  So whatever we are all trying to fill in for Mary Berra and put

168
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,880
Speaker 5:  on a good show and make it good. And so Kara's like, Yo's gonna do it and

169
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,840
Speaker 5:  that's great. Like fine. And so, and Linda knew this information, right?

170
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,380
Speaker 5:  Like there was a lot of consternation about what she would drop out or not.

171
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,020
Speaker 5:  We should tell her like obviously, so Kara knows her, she texted

172
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,800
Speaker 5:  her, she knew, she knew the entire day. And basically we spent the

173
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,640
Speaker 5:  day being like, is she gonna show up or not? Like who knows, maybe

174
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,400
Speaker 5:  she won't. That'll be its own news. She showed up. So that, that's like the

175
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,100
Speaker 5:  whole backstory. Yeah. And the like, I think

176
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,740
Speaker 4:  The, the backstory of it and the interview are sort of two different things.

177
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,640
Speaker 4:  And the interview itself actually for all of the drama around it is not that

178
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,520
Speaker 4:  interesting. Like Julia Borson did a really good job of trying to get her

179
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,780
Speaker 4:  to say something interesting and revelatory about what's going on at x.

180
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,240
Speaker 5:  Can I, can I just say something about Julia? Julia is incredible and like

181
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,000
Speaker 5:  watching Julia work up close was like, I was like, oh, I have a, I have a

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,600
Speaker 5:  long way to go. Like that's really how I feel. Like, oh, I've got a long

183
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,000
Speaker 5:  way to go. She over-prepared. She knows her shit cold. She knows

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,920
Speaker 5:  everybody. There's one thing when you're, you know, when you're like near

185
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,080
Speaker 5:  someone for a long time and you're like watching them work, you like notice

186
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,870
Speaker 5:  things about them. When Juliet is in the middle of an interview and she knows

187
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,780
Speaker 5:  that she has it, she smiles like it and like maybe it doesn't come through

188
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,320
Speaker 5:  on tv, but like in person, I was like, oh, I can see that she has it. It

189
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,400
Speaker 5:  was, it was incredible. It's

190
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,320
Speaker 4:  Like the the poker hand. Like I have, I have a good hand tell. Yeah.

191
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,640
Speaker 5:  It's like the tiniest little tell and she's like, I'm holding a knife. It's

192
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,540
Speaker 5:  great. The, like, all that's great. The Lindy interview was pure chaos. Right?

193
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,040
Speaker 5:  And because of Yol and because Linda Dec had decided I

194
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,760
Speaker 5:  think inaccurately and inappropriately decided that she could blame all of

195
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,280
Speaker 5:  her problems on Yue, she kept going back to it, you know, and that's like

196
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,160
Speaker 5:  a sympathetic position. I I I understand why like, sort of intuitively

197
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,640
Speaker 5:  like I could just be like mad about you all and everyone in this room will

198
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,030
Speaker 5:  care about, but she knew. But if you watch Julia, all of her

199
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,000
Speaker 5:  like cable news anchor training, she's like, I

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,320
Speaker 5:  don't, I'm moving on. Like I'm not gonna let you do this. That part of it,

201
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,520
Speaker 5:  if you're like a journalism nerd, go back and watch that interview. Don't

202
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,200
Speaker 5:  pay attention to Linda, pay attention to Julia. And it is actually just

203
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,680
Speaker 5:  revelatory. Like again, I walked away thinking, oh, I've had a lot to learn.

204
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,390
Speaker 5:  I have a lot to learn about how to do this.

205
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,280
Speaker 4:  Just the ability to constantly say, can I finish my question is like a real,

206
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,080
Speaker 4:  it's a real skill. Can I finish my question, David? To do in front of a lot

207
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,850
Speaker 4:  of people, it's very impressive,

208
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,580
Speaker 5:  Right? There's a room full of people, some of whom

209
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,520
Speaker 5:  are not on any one side, right? They're just like there for the train wreck.

210
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Some of whom are there. And they're very sympathetic to Linda and some

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,740
Speaker 5:  of whom are there and they're very sympathetic. Like whatever it's, or they're

212
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,620
Speaker 5:  mad at Twitter, whatever it is. And like the tension

213
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,520
Speaker 5:  in that room was out of control. Mm. And so for Julia to

214
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,260
Speaker 5:  stay locked in and focused on, I am going to ask

215
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,160
Speaker 5:  the questions again. Watch that side of it. 'cause it is

216
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,710
Speaker 5:  incredible.

217
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And it's like hard questions about halfway through, she, she kind

218
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,820
Speaker 6:  of manages to get Linda off of blaming Yol

219
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,800
Speaker 6:  for all of her responses. Yeah. Which is like, like the first half

220
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,400
Speaker 6:  of it. She's, she, she makes a lot of remarks. Yeah. About like, yeah. No

221
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,480
Speaker 6:  one knew who was here today. Yeah.

222
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,360
Speaker 5:  It's like every, I promise you, you know what, like we all

223
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,150
Speaker 5:  saw what app she had on her phone. Yoel was on the schedule.

224
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,640
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

225
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,040
Speaker 5:  Right. He was like listed publicly on the schedule. Yeah. We updated the

226
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,540
Speaker 5:  app like 50 times. 'cause we were, we were moving the things. 'cause she,

227
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,440
Speaker 5:  you know, Linda had first insisted on being last. She wanted cloak.

228
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,240
Speaker 5:  Right. And then she was like, no, I want to go before y'all. And then she

229
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,400
Speaker 5:  switched it back. So like, actually the schedule is moving all day. It's

230
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,080
Speaker 5:  like, you there, none of this was a secret. Okay. In fact, more of it should

231
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,830
Speaker 5:  have been a secret.

232
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:02,080
Speaker 4:  Fair. Yeah. Alex, you, you and I have both watched the interview since the,

233
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,800
Speaker 4:  the full thing got posted. Did you take anything of like substance

234
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,600
Speaker 4:  away from it? About x the company or platform?

235
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,280
Speaker 6:  I took a lot about it from the hostility towards

236
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,850
Speaker 6:  journalism that I saw in it. Like that was the main thing I took away was

237
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,720
Speaker 6:  we've seen that thread of hostility from the company since Elon

238
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,440
Speaker 6:  took over and saw it very apparently on stage. And knowing now that

239
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,280
Speaker 6:  like she knew because you watch it initially and you're like, oh,

240
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,040
Speaker 6:  she just found out. Yeah, I'd probably be that pissed on stage two. Like

241
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,540
Speaker 6:  no, if you knew the whole day.

242
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,020
Speaker 5:  And by the way, not to say anything about Yoel Yoel is great.

243
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,560
Speaker 5:  And you know, he, he's very compelling and he knows a lot of shit about trust

244
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,380
Speaker 5:  and safety. There was no content in his interview that

245
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,410
Speaker 5:  he had not shared before. Right.

246
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,130
Speaker 6:  Right. Like, like the things he was saying was things he said quite often

247
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,400
Speaker 6:  about the company that

248
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,000
Speaker 5:  He has put in the New York Times. But by the way, if, if, if you want like

249
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,080
Speaker 5:  a slightly more produced version of the Ill interview, you can go listen

250
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,980
Speaker 5:  to an episode of this American life that he did with Casey

251
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,960
Speaker 5:  Newton. Again, he's very compelling. I'm glad he was on stage. I'm glad that

252
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,690
Speaker 5:  audience, which you know, is a very powerful influential audience. Like

253
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,600
Speaker 5:  heard it. I think that's important. But if you

254
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,440
Speaker 5:  are Linda, there was nothing that you were reacting to that you had, you

255
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,650
Speaker 5:  hadn't already reacted to.

256
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,220
Speaker 4:  Right.

257
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,200
Speaker 6:  It was just like a very familiar, like, you, you see this kind of hostility

258
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,800
Speaker 6:  sometimes from people who, who don't want to give you the answers and they,

259
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,520
Speaker 6:  they have their narrative and they really don't wanna deviate from that

260
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,520
Speaker 6:  narrative. Yeah. And that just seemed to be the case here. And I was like,

261
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,920
Speaker 6:  okay, so I'm not gonna get necessarily something substantial from

262
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,760
Speaker 6:  Linda, but I thought it was a very revealing interview

263
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,940
Speaker 6:  even if it wasn't like a substantial one. Like it was super revealing

264
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,720
Speaker 5:  To me. Is there a scientific term for revealing nothing for like

265
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,130
Speaker 5:  the substance of something to be nothing

266
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:49,520
Speaker 4:  Press

267
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,220
Speaker 4:  releases?

268
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,720
Speaker 4:  No, I think, I mean, to me, even the things that she said, and this is the

269
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,800
Speaker 4:  thing that has really stuck with me about the interview, is even the things

270
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,960
Speaker 4:  that she said didn't seem like they were true. Like she

271
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,840
Speaker 4:  named, I think the number was 540 million monthly active users. And

272
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,060
Speaker 4:  she said that, or not monthly active users, just users.

273
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,720
Speaker 4:  So whatever that means. She said that number twice. So I'm inclined to believe

274
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,570
Speaker 4:  that is actually a number. But then she said, she said,

275
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,360
Speaker 4:  Julia asked about how many daily active users X has, which is actually a

276
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,220
Speaker 4:  really important number, right? Like we, there are a million external things

277
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,930
Speaker 4:  saying X is not doing well. Right? Like there are

278
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,260
Speaker 4:  engagement metrics that seem to be down that are all reported by third parties.

279
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,590
Speaker 4:  So, you know, grain of salt with that,

280
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,110
Speaker 5:  That people on the platform are experiencing, right?

281
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,880
Speaker 4:  It's way down on the app store. Like all of the vibes are bad, but the

282
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,840
Speaker 4:  number of people who log into Twitter every day is like potentially the

283
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,280
Speaker 4:  most important number. And I don't believe for one

284
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,840
Speaker 4:  second that she doesn't know that number to like the decimal

285
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,800
Speaker 4:  place. And instead she gets up and is like, oh, it's between 200 and

286
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:58,040
Speaker 4:  250 million people every day. And Julia followed up by

287
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,800
Speaker 4:  saying that it was 237 million when Elon Musk took it

288
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,480
Speaker 4:  over. And then Linda said at 1.2 25 and

289
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,160
Speaker 4:  there's just like, you don't have to tell anybody you're a private company

290
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,580
Speaker 4:  owned by one dude

291
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,520
Speaker 5:  At one point she pulled out her phone Yeah. To as though she was

292
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,420
Speaker 5:  going to check the number and then did not, and then

293
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,800
Speaker 5:  showed the phone to the audience and it was just her home screen. And

294
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,160
Speaker 4:  A lot of sleuthing has showed that X was not on her home screen.

295
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,780
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's a very confusing situation. Well,

296
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,680
Speaker 6:  And we just got a report this week about most

297
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,500
Speaker 6:  of the big companies daily, like daily active users.

298
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,240
Speaker 6:  And it was so far from that I think Twitter was like 56 million. Oh

299
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,740
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Twitter. Twitter's always, again, I and I, I've said this many times

300
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,600
Speaker 5:  and I I will say it again now very clearly for everyone to

301
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,200
Speaker 5:  hear me criticism of, of Twitter or ex's current

302
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,040
Speaker 5:  leadership is in no way praise for

303
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,000
Speaker 5:  the previous administration. Yeah. They were bad. And actually one

304
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,880
Speaker 5:  of the most interesting things about it is you can make

305
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,840
Speaker 5:  an argument that Twitter is so hard to run and it is such a

306
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,700
Speaker 5:  mess that that version of bad was

307
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,360
Speaker 5:  the only way to be. Like, they had entered a steady state of

308
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,430
Speaker 5:  horribleness, but they weren't growing, they weren't making any money. They,

309
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,200
Speaker 5:  this is why they sold it to Elon at an inflated share price because it's

310
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,080
Speaker 5:  board of directors had come essentially come to the conclusion that

311
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,000
Speaker 5:  nothing they could do would ever bring the company to that share price on

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,920
Speaker 5:  their own. That is like, if you look at the mirror, you

313
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,680
Speaker 5:  know, like, you know, like every kid wakes up one day and like realizes like,

314
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,260
Speaker 5:  I am not gonna pass chem. Like I'm just not gonna be a doctor.

315
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,920
Speaker 5:  You know, like maybe that was just me. But like, you know,

316
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,880
Speaker 5:  there's like those moments in your life where like, ah, I had better give

317
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,460
Speaker 5:  up

318
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,350
Speaker 6:  Me in sports.

319
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,250
Speaker 5:  Like Twitter as a company was like,

320
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,040
Speaker 5:  we're never gonna hit $44 a share. And they sold it to Elon. And

321
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,780
Speaker 5:  like, again, I just don't wanna say like, criticism of this administration

322
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,740
Speaker 5:  is praise. It does not imply that they were doing, they were doing a horrible

323
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,360
Speaker 5:  job such that they quit just flat out, they just quit. They couldn't figure

324
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,640
Speaker 5:  out how to do it on their own. They, and they, and they sold it to Elon 'cause

325
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,560
Speaker 5:  he showed up like a dummy to buy it. But it's not that he's now put in place

326
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,480
Speaker 5:  a team that will do a better job. He's put in place a team, a

327
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,280
Speaker 5:  C E O who doesn't appear to know what's going on. Yeah. I

328
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,120
Speaker 4:  Think to me, like the worst look for Linda in this

329
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,940
Speaker 4:  entire interview, which is a fairly high bar in this particular interview,

330
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,720
Speaker 4:  was when Julia asked about Musk's

331
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,600
Speaker 4:  tweet about going to a fully subscription model where

332
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,420
Speaker 4:  everyone using Twitter would have to pay for Twitter. And I'm,

333
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,640
Speaker 4:  I'm paraphrasing, but Linda was basically like, well she first asked to repeat

334
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,000
Speaker 4:  the question, which was bizarre. It was a very simple question. No,

335
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,840
Speaker 6:  I don't say, I don't think that was bizarre. I like, like everybody is like,

336
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,860
Speaker 6:  oh, she didn't know the answer.

337
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,660
Speaker 4:  Oh sure. It was a total filibuster.

338
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,040
Speaker 6:  She was straight up filibustering like, like let's, let's give her a

339
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,920
Speaker 6:  little, a little acknowledgement of that. At least she was, she

340
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,700
Speaker 6:  was doing something wasn't,

341
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,360
Speaker 4:  But then Julia rephrases the question and she

342
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,340
Speaker 4:  says, I think she says, did he say that's what we're doing

343
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,040
Speaker 4:  or that's what he's thinking about? And then Julia said, yeah, he said

344
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,760
Speaker 4:  that's the plan. So at this point it's now abundantly clear that Linda

345
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,400
Speaker 4:  doesn't know what's going on. And, and then she says essentially in response

346
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,320
Speaker 4:  to another question, she says, we talk about everything and then has no more

347
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,680
Speaker 4:  response. So I don't know how I'm supposed to come out of that. Yeah. Not

348
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,800
Speaker 4:  thinking that she didn't know this was a thing.

349
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,520
Speaker 6:  I came out of that thinking she was filibustering and trying to make fun

350
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,400
Speaker 6:  of Julia for asking the question at all. Like the way she looked

351
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,320
Speaker 6:  to the audience after she's like, did he say that? Or, and that's why

352
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,780
Speaker 6:  I wanna know like Neli, you were there.

353
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,720
Speaker 5:  She okay being in the room Linda, I don't know, I,

354
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,520
Speaker 5:  I don't know. I was in that room all day

355
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,420
Speaker 5:  and I would just say the com, the room was packed. You know,

356
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,180
Speaker 5:  a lot of things, if you ever go to a conference, like the composition of

357
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,380
Speaker 5:  the room changes over the day. 'cause people are like networking, they're

358
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,540
Speaker 5:  like doing it whatever. And like they're like doing work halls, whatever.

359
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,640
Speaker 5:  Like this was packed

360
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,330
Speaker 5:  and Linda got a lot of cheers, which

361
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,710
Speaker 6:  Like big cheers.

362
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,770
Speaker 5:  Linda came with an entourage

363
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,260
Speaker 4:  Like the, like the Apple employees you hear cheering at an Apple event. This

364
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,930
Speaker 4:  was like a small version of that. Yeah,

365
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It was, there was just, there was an element in there that was weird.

366
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,860
Speaker 5:  And I'll say this at the end, Julia got a standing

367
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,480
Speaker 5:  ovation. This is a real thing that happened at the end of code. Like

368
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,760
Speaker 6:  She deserved it.

369
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,620
Speaker 5:  The conference ends, Linda leaves Casey and I walked back on stage. I

370
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,320
Speaker 5:  literally said, holy shit. And then I said Julia Borson everyone.

371
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,940
Speaker 5:  And, and Julia got That's great. A standing ovation from that crowd. That's

372
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,300
Speaker 5:  awesome. So like, you know when I say the composition of the room was, it

373
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,260
Speaker 5:  was odd, but the people who were noisiest at the beginning were like

374
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,240
Speaker 5:  the Linda people. Yeah. And so I think she thought the room was a

375
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,440
Speaker 5:  lot warmer to her than it might have been. Been. She

376
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:54,680
Speaker 6:  Played to

377
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,600
Speaker 5:  The room a little lot on, she played to the room a lot because I think she

378
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,720
Speaker 5:  had the sense that the room was really was like on her side. So she kept

379
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,470
Speaker 5:  looking at the room is though everyone agreed with her that this was bullshit.

380
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,860
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And that was not the case. And the one example of that, which

381
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,640
Speaker 5:  was absolutely the funniest thing that I've ever seen happen at

382
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,200
Speaker 5:  Code. And I've been to, I've been gonna this conference for a decade. She

383
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,100
Speaker 5:  said, who wouldn't want Elon Musk by their side running product?

384
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,760
Speaker 5:  And like there's just like, people just like burst into laugh. Did they start

385
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,600
Speaker 5:  raising their hands? Because it's a room full of product people. Like what

386
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,440
Speaker 5:  did I say at the beginning? What did I want code to be? I wanted the code

387
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,040
Speaker 5:  to be about product. Who did we invite? Who did we put on the stage? Who

388
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,780
Speaker 5:  did they bring? Product people? And they were like,

389
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,410
Speaker 5:  no. And Julia was like, raise your hand if, and like

390
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,280
Speaker 5:  every, I was like, I cannot believe like you

391
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,030
Speaker 5:  don't know, like you don't know This is a room full of product people.

392
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,920
Speaker 6:  That was a brutal moment.

393
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,960
Speaker 4:  Alright, that's enough of that.

394
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,600
Speaker 5:  I could talk about this by the way for the like maybe the rest of it.

395
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,920
Speaker 4:  I know, which is precisely why it's enough of that. Let's, this

396
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,160
Speaker 5:  Is why I was like, I need to be the guest, not the us.

397
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,000
Speaker 4:  Everybody should go, it's worth watching the whole interview. You're gonna

398
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,040
Speaker 4:  get three minutes in and your whole body is gonna start to feel itchy because

399
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,670
Speaker 4:  it is very uncomfortable.

400
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,710
Speaker 5:  Imagine being in the room.

401
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,000
Speaker 6:  It's like the first half have never been kissed, which is the most excruciating

402
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,740
Speaker 6:  movie.

403
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,520
Speaker 5:  And then just, just to make it about me for one second, very

404
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,400
Speaker 5:  important. Imagine being like, I have to go back out on the stage after.

405
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,030
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Was holy shit a rehearsed line. Had you like stood backstage going,

406
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,560
Speaker 4:  holy shit, holy shit. Like yeah,

407
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,370
Speaker 6:  That's on the teleprompter. Actually,

408
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,940
Speaker 5:  Casey and I were just like holding hands like what are we gonna do?

409
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,160
Speaker 4:  That's great. But yeah, everybody, we'll put it in the show notes. You should

410
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,000
Speaker 4:  go watch it. Go listen to it. It's, it's really interesting. Let's just blow

411
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,750
Speaker 4:  through some of the actual like interesting product stuff that happened.

412
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,740
Speaker 4:  Yeah. To me the Getty AI thing was

413
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,700
Speaker 4:  one of the most interesting pieces of the whole show. Yeah. Do you wanna,

414
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,520
Speaker 4:  do you wanna just explain a little bit about that conversation and what we

415
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,840
Speaker 4:  got from Craig Peters? The, the Getty c e o? Yeah.

416
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,120
Speaker 5:  So. we had two conversations back to back that I really wanted to make sure

417
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,420
Speaker 5:  we had back to back. It was Microsoft C T o, Kevin Scott who is wonderful

418
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,280
Speaker 5:  and the c e o of Getty. Craig Peters who is a firecracker.

419
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,840
Speaker 5:  Right. But

420
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,510
Speaker 4:  You wouldn't think for the Getty c e o but like kudos.

421
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But he's great. He's a creative, like he ba he manages

422
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,680
Speaker 5:  thousands of photographers. Like once you like put that together, like oh,

423
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,200
Speaker 5:  you're like, oh, I get it. You know? So Getty is suing stability ai, which

424
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,480
Speaker 5:  makes stable diffusion and the, you know, the, the lawsuit is what you think.

425
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,040
Speaker 5:  It's whether training on copyrighted images is fair

426
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,800
Speaker 5:  use, stable diffusion is like some, I

427
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,680
Speaker 5:  don't, I don't think think it does this anymore, but like for a while would

428
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,560
Speaker 5:  produce the Getty watermark in AI generated images. And Getty is like, come

429
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,030
Speaker 5:  on. Right. So, you know, everyone thinks that stability is kind of a

430
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,580
Speaker 5:  chaotic company. They refuse to come on stager code. We'd invited them

431
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,320
Speaker 5:  to, you know, respond to Craig and they, they said no, it says a

432
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,880
Speaker 5:  lot. But you know, Craig's entire thesis was like you can build AI

433
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,290
Speaker 5:  tools that don't step on other people's copyrighted stuff. And in fact, fact

434
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,960
Speaker 5:  we have. And so, you know, they, they shut off their brand new product stuff

435
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,760
Speaker 5:  at code. They shut off their brand new AI image generator and we like had

436
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,720
Speaker 5:  fun using it on stage. But his argument was this industry

437
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,400
Speaker 5:  is stepping all over creatives and like what Getty makes is

438
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,320
Speaker 5:  important to history and we need to like protect it and

439
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,080
Speaker 5:  we need to build business models that protect it instead of just like Racing

440
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,040
Speaker 5:  headlong into devaluing it even further. And the reason I said I put

441
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,830
Speaker 5:  the interviews back to back is because my, Kevin Scott is an author,

442
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,200
Speaker 5:  he's an artist, he's a maker, he is a renaissance man. He's great. He can

443
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,960
Speaker 5:  talk about anything. Microsoft has a $10 billion

444
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,740
Speaker 5:  bet on it being fair use. Yeah. With OpenAI, right? Like

445
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,880
Speaker 5:  that's crazy. And so, you know, Kevin was like, a lot of people think this

446
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,880
Speaker 5:  is fair use. And I was like, not everyone and Then we brought out Craig,

447
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,520
Speaker 5:  which was really cool. So listen to those two conversations back to back.

448
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,720
Speaker 5:  They, you know, they're all gonna up the Decoder feed and they'll be on The,

449
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,680
Speaker 5:  Verge YouTube. But that was the dynamic that I really put in front of

450
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,240
Speaker 5:  everybody. Like the industry has not figured out this huge

451
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,040
Speaker 5:  problem at the center of ai. And we had, you know, we had Warner

452
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,520
Speaker 5:  Music, c e o Robert Kinsel on stage, he's a Former head of business at

453
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,400
Speaker 5:  YouTube. Like I'm not on the side of the music industry very

454
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,880
Speaker 5:  often. I'm not on the side of fig copyright very often. But you see this

455
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,440
Speaker 5:  dynamic and actually like shuffles the decks a little bit. And the gian

456
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,160
Speaker 5:  conversation in particular, I think really brought us to the

457
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,920
Speaker 5:  fore. 'cause they're making some of the technology too. They want to show

458
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,870
Speaker 5:  that you can make the technology in the right way.

459
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:14,840
Speaker 4:  That bit that he showed where he was basically like, we're in this race

460
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,440
Speaker 4:  with, you know, open AI and Anthropic and Google where everybody's trying

461
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,320
Speaker 4:  to do the biggest possible thing, right? Like everybody brags about like

462
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,040
Speaker 4:  the number of parameters in their model and how big the training set is.

463
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,080
Speaker 4:  And it's like everything is supposed to be this gigantic all purpose thing

464
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,960
Speaker 4:  for everybody, for everything forever. Like AI is just Windows now,

465
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,370
Speaker 4:  right? Like it's huge. And then I thought I, that was just why I thought

466
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,640
Speaker 4:  Craig and the Getty stuff is so interesting because like we can take this

467
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,440
Speaker 4:  smaller corpus of data that is better and we can actually make

468
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,020
Speaker 4:  it work just as well, but more successfully

469
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,910
Speaker 4:  for everyone involved. And I just think that's very cool.

470
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And then somehow inside of that, there's one more piece, one more term

471
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,320
Speaker 5:  that's super interesting in there. And somehow we will

472
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,280
Speaker 5:  compensate the artists whose work is in the training data. And I

473
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,690
Speaker 5:  was like, how? And he is like, we just are making it up.

474
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,910
Speaker 4:  Right? Yeah. He was very honest about like, we only have half the answers.

475
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,630
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

476
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But he is like, right now we're basically doing it on popularity. Like

477
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,080
Speaker 5:  if, if you are, it's like spot the way Spotify works. Like this was

478
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,320
Speaker 5:  to weedsy to get into on the code stage. But the, the

479
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,400
Speaker 5:  answer is like, we'll look at the proportion of

480
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,350
Speaker 5:  images inside of the training data that people

481
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:25,320
Speaker 5:  call up more often in the wider world of Getty. And then when

482
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,080
Speaker 5:  people pay to generate images, we'll dole out fractions of a

483
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,040
Speaker 5:  penny based on that sort of like underlying ranking, which is like, it is

484
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,720
Speaker 5:  more like how Spotify works than anything. But it is not some

485
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,320
Speaker 5:  incredible complicated algorithm about what training pixels

486
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,200
Speaker 5:  were put. It's, it's more like what's popular. You get more money, you

487
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,260
Speaker 5:  know, like it's, and like they're, they need to refine that.

488
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,030
Speaker 4:  The other one, Alex, you and I watched Casey Bois together. What,

489
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,800
Speaker 4:  what did, did we get anything from Casey that, that we thought was interesting?

490
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,570
Speaker 4:  Casey Bois runs H B O is like a very important person. This happened

491
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,880
Speaker 4:  right after the end of the writer Strike So. we had like new information.

492
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,640
Speaker 4:  Peter Kafka interviewed him. They talked a little bit about that, a little

493
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,840
Speaker 4:  bit about some other stuff. Like what, what, what did we get from Casey that

494
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,980
Speaker 4:  you thought was interesting?

495
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,560
Speaker 6:  We got the true detective season four trailer, which looks, I'm just apparently

496
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,720
Speaker 6:  very excited. Yeah. Yeah. I think I was like texting you like, this is my

497
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,020
Speaker 6:  personality for the next four months. Yeah. Yeah. I think we just got his,

498
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,880
Speaker 6:  his reinforcement of David Slovs kind of way of thinking out there, right?

499
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,860
Speaker 6:  Like he was talking a lot about how the, the cable bundle was back

500
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,630
Speaker 6:  and it was gonna be on, on these streaming services and that

501
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,480
Speaker 6:  like, he felt that was he, that was good. And, and he wants

502
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,680
Speaker 6:  to see that more. And, and then they talked a lot about this new show Naked

503
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,280
Speaker 6:  Attraction that's on a p o Max just kept coming up, which was

504
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,040
Speaker 6:  like my, my sister-in-law had just texted me the night before about it and

505
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,320
Speaker 6:  I'd never heard about it. And I was like, yes, I know what he's talking about.

506
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,630
Speaker 6:  'cause I just Googled this and, and so he was kind of like

507
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,520
Speaker 6:  defending the way that they're choosing what they put on H B O and

508
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,480
Speaker 6:  what they, what they share as H B O versus Max versus Cartoon

509
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,400
Speaker 6:  Network versus all H G T V and all of these other channels that are

510
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,190
Speaker 6:  now part of, of the larger streaming ecosystem. And

511
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,400
Speaker 6:  yeah, it was, it was mainly just like reinforcement of David Al's kind of

512
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,880
Speaker 6:  way of thinking and that it was nice. Like, it was interesting to see that.

513
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,160
Speaker 6:  'cause you're kinda like, well how does, how does someone like Boise think

514
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,960
Speaker 6:  about it? And apparently very similarly,

515
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,150
Speaker 4:  I don't know, Neil, what did you, what did you take away from it?

516
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,920
Speaker 5:  That I think Casey Boise is maybe one of the most powerful people at

517
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,280
Speaker 5:  Warner Brothers Discovery. And he knows it and David Zla knows

518
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,060
Speaker 5:  it and you know, the, the stuff about H B O versus

519
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,920
Speaker 5:  Max, like, he was just very calm and comfortable with it. You know,

520
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,800
Speaker 5:  I I I saw Casey backstage and I was like, do you want me to ask you some

521
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,420
Speaker 5:  more questions about H B O Max versus Max? And he's like, Jesus Christ

522
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,940
Speaker 5:  man. But you know, his, his thesis,

523
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,840
Speaker 5:  his argument was that H B O by itself has never been a successful business

524
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,920
Speaker 5:  in the history of H B O. Even when you think about people paying for H B

525
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,690
Speaker 5:  O directly. He's like, people had a cable bundle and they would pay us

526
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,960
Speaker 5:  extra money for H B O and if we don't ride along with that cable

527
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,760
Speaker 5:  bundle, that has never been a successful business for us. Is that a

528
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,400
Speaker 5:  recon? Maybe, you know, like maybe, yeah. But it

529
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,760
Speaker 5:  is historically true and you know, there's a new owner at the company and

530
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,600
Speaker 5:  that is his thesis that's very much has Oslo. Things like what

531
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,400
Speaker 5:  people want is 90 day fiance and then sometimes they want intruder

532
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,300
Speaker 5:  detective. It's not the other way around. And that

533
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,980
Speaker 5:  is, I think probably Vergecast listeners don't feel that way.

534
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,830
Speaker 5:  But Ha have you ever been to America?

535
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,570
Speaker 6:  Like I think that's, I honestly I do think that's true,

536
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,280
Speaker 6:  right? Like, like most people are watching the reason you like H B O and

537
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,960
Speaker 6:  the reason you like those things is that like Sunday night you go watch H

538
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,280
Speaker 6:  B O but you were probably weren't watching H B O every single night of the

539
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,200
Speaker 6:  week when you were were watching TV channels. Yeah. I mean you could have

540
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,400
Speaker 6:  been, but like, that was a very small population of folks and they could

541
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,410
Speaker 6:  kind of be uns insufferable.

542
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:52,120
Speaker 5:  Right? What are the dominant TV like from the golden age of

543
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,280
Speaker 5:  television in the Bundle? It's, but it's a bunch of network TV series. It's

544
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,960
Speaker 5:  friends, it's the Office, right? Like, and there's still Dominant, which

545
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,880
Speaker 5:  is crazy. So yeah, I, you know, there there was that, he talked a lot about

546
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,860
Speaker 5:  H B O shows now appearing on Netflix again and he was like, look

547
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,280
Speaker 5:  in, you know, the brass ring used to be syndication and we need to go back

548
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,640
Speaker 5:  there. And we went through this weird period where everyone was trying to

549
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,920
Speaker 5:  build their own little monopoly and we've like, we've realized like that's

550
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,820
Speaker 5:  not the way. And I was like, I always knew that wasn't the way.

551
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,200
Speaker 6:  No, no one's told Netflix though, right?

552
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,880
Speaker 5:  Well I but that Netflix is a different business. It's the only one that's

553
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,660
Speaker 5:  successful, right? They, they fired like just cannon

554
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,080
Speaker 5:  blasts of venture capital money into building their moat. And everyone else

555
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,200
Speaker 5:  tried to do it and it like destroyed the industry along the way. Casey didn't

556
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,280
Speaker 5:  talk about the strike by the way, speaking of cost going up. And Peter asked

557
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,920
Speaker 5:  him like, is the resolution of this strike and maybe the SAG strike gonna

558
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,660
Speaker 5:  bring your costs up 'cause your labor costs are higher. And he was like,

559
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,560
Speaker 5:  no. Which I think if I was in the Writer's Guild or the Screen

560
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,920
Speaker 5:  Actor's Guild, I'd be like, yeah, we told you so. By the way, here's all

561
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,700
Speaker 5:  the disclosures are staff is unionized by the

562
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,640
Speaker 5:  WGA e Alex is in the WGA e we, Comcast is one

563
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,260
Speaker 5:  of our investors. Linda Yaccarino doesn't like me very much.

564
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,840
Speaker 4:  We made a Netflix show. We we made

565
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,960
Speaker 5:  A Netflix show. Yeah. I'm the EP of a Netflix show. Someone has asked this

566
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,100
Speaker 5:  many times. That show is not because it's documentary, it was not covered.

567
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,030
Speaker 5:  You what? It's what What do you want from me?

568
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,000
Speaker 4:  Neli so tight. I'm

569
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,990
Speaker 5:  Hosted a code conference. I'm so tired.

570
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,570
Speaker 6:  Alright,

571
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:20,160
Speaker 4:  Let's do, we're gonna, I wanna talk more about the rider strike. We're gonna

572
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,940
Speaker 4:  get to that in a little bit because it ended in some really interesting ways.

573
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,800
Speaker 4:  So we're gonna talk about that. Let's do two more just ultra fast

574
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,000
Speaker 4:  things about code and then get outta here. Yeah. First Neli, I am going to

575
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,440
Speaker 4:  give you 65 seconds and no longer to talk about the Monarch

576
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,060
Speaker 4:  tractor c e o that you had on stage. Ready Go.

577
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,000
Speaker 5:  The most important interview I did a code was with Pravin Piso, the C e O

578
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,720
Speaker 5:  of Monarch tractor. I opened that interview by saying the

579
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,340
Speaker 5:  entire human species is utterly dependent on tractors. And I

580
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,910
Speaker 5:  saw Jake, like our deaf owner, Jake, just start cracking. He is like, oh,

581
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,840
Speaker 5:  NE's on his bullshit again. It's true. It's

582
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,060
Speaker 5:  a fact. Pravin just like blew the crowd away by talking about his tractor.

583
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,810
Speaker 5:  So it's an ev tractor has a full sensor suite. They built it to be

584
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,600
Speaker 5:  ultra modular. All the, the sensor suite is in the roof of the tractor, which

585
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,240
Speaker 5:  is just a handful of bolts in a couple cables for power, power and

586
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,720
Speaker 5:  data. And he's like, that is what we're gonna upgrade. Like over time we'll

587
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,440
Speaker 5:  just sell you new roofs. Other people can have new roofs or, you know, they're

588
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,940
Speaker 5:  the open ecosystem compared to John Deere. They're partnered with Case is

589
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,760
Speaker 5:  making tractors using their technology. Go watch it. He's like, we're

590
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,520
Speaker 5:  we're the Android. Like John Deere's the iPhone close proprietary, hard to

591
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,640
Speaker 5:  service. We're gonna be the open eco ecosystem and the tractor's

592
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,960
Speaker 4:  Cool. Yeah. His line was, we're becoming the Android of agriculture, which

593
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,270
Speaker 4:  is just an unbelievably cool it love and vergie sentences.

594
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,090
Speaker 5:  It's, and I will tell you this, I've, I've talked a lot about the crowd,

595
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,040
Speaker 5:  crowd in this room. They loved him by the end of this, they were like, oh,

596
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,500
Speaker 5:  tractors are the shit. Like one person was like, I'm gonna buy a tractor

597
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,350
Speaker 5:  for my vineyard. Which is the code audience.

598
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,210
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I, I did a, I did a conference one time and basically just

599
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,820
Speaker 4:  introduced a man and asked him, so three D printing houses, huh? And he talked

600
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,400
Speaker 4:  for like 20 uninterrupted minutes about all the cool things you can do when

601
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,920
Speaker 4:  you can three d print concrete houses. And it was the most excited room I've

602
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,360
Speaker 4:  ever been in. Like, people love this stuff. It's awesome. The world runs

603
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,270
Speaker 4:  on it. I agree.

604
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:10,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Technology and products. I'm telling you it's the, that's, that's what

605
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,790
Speaker 5:  code's all about.

606
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,520
Speaker 4:  It's, it's the stuff. And then the other one was Artifact, Mike

607
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,320
Speaker 4:  Krieger, which I think I continue to think Artifact is interesting, but it's

608
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,480
Speaker 4:  like a little kind of tiny thing. But they just launched Twitter at code,

609
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,710
Speaker 4:  right? Like Mike Krieger was just like, we're doing Twitter.

610
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah. C co-founder and co-founder of

611
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,990
Speaker 5:  Instagram launches Instagram.

612
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,350
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

613
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,500
Speaker 5:  It's like, I don't know what you want me to say. Like, KRE Krieger's great.

614
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,160
Speaker 5:  He was literally coding, you know, artifacts a tiny company. He was literally

615
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,960
Speaker 5:  shipping code in our green room. That's awesome. And he was like, this is

616
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,880
Speaker 5:  so much better than being at the big company. So that was really fun.

617
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Go look. It's Twitter, right? It's posts. The only, the only real difference

618
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,080
Speaker 5:  is you have to have a photo for some reason, which is a lot of Instagram

619
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,920
Speaker 5:  d n a coming through. But you know what, what, what Mike Krieger

620
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,750
Speaker 5:  has told me, what Kevin Strom has told me is they always launched Artifact

621
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,480
Speaker 5:  with the goal of being something much bigger with the goal of creating a

622
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,520
Speaker 5:  much bigger corpus of machine learning data and doing more interesting things

623
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,080
Speaker 5:  with it. And you can see they started with it's links on the

624
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,050
Speaker 5:  web. It's a recommendation engine for webpage to, you can share

625
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,080
Speaker 5:  links to now you can just share your own content and we will recommend that

626
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,400
Speaker 5:  to you. And they're building a, they're building sort of like an AI first

627
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,310
Speaker 5:  social network. It's cool. And like again,

628
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,280
Speaker 5:  what, what, what am I hammering home here? Yes, there's the chaos. There

629
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,480
Speaker 5:  is a lot of product conversation to code. Like an awful lot

630
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,200
Speaker 5:  of what products are we building? Why are we building them? What are the

631
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,130
Speaker 5:  dependencies on Nvidia, on GPUs, on

632
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,690
Speaker 5:  other stuff that we need to overcome in order to build products. And to me

633
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,210
Speaker 5:  Mike was like the, the pinnacle of that moment. 'cause he was literally building

634
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,650
Speaker 5:  the product in the green room before he walked out on stage. He was

635
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:50,230
Speaker 4:  Great. And then, okay, last one. You did not successfully

636
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,690
Speaker 4:  get RJs Care and the c e o of Rivian to talk shit about the cyber

637
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,290
Speaker 4:  truck, but I would say he made fairly clear that he thinks the cyber truck

638
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,400
Speaker 4:  is stupid. Would you agree with that assessment?

639
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,210
Speaker 5:  Yeah, you know, there's the code name of Decoder is Neli versus

640
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,130
Speaker 5:  media training. You know, it's like, can I fight you to a draw? And like,

641
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,730
Speaker 5:  sometimes I usually get to a draw. I think sometimes I win And

642
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:10,310
Speaker 5:  that's,

643
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,610
Speaker 4:  And then the sub CEO e o gets in trouble.

644
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,890
Speaker 5:  Yeah, exactly. Like sometimes I win too much,

645
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,490
Speaker 5:  honestly. But it's like fine. It's a game. And that's why CEOs come and do

646
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,130
Speaker 5:  it 'cause they're all type A and it's, it's, you know, it's a game that's

647
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,730
Speaker 5:  set up to, to be winnable. Like, not to be unfair, but you know, you know,

648
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,650
Speaker 5:  the questions are coming. And the reason I bring all that up is sometimes

649
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:32,530
Speaker 5:  I can see the media training and the most devastating answer you

650
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,970
Speaker 5:  can give inside of the media training is, well that's a

651
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,380
Speaker 5:  choice.

652
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,230
Speaker 4:  As as as allowable answers go. That is the most damning one.

653
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,010
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

654
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,160
Speaker 5:  Right. It's like, yeah, people are Freeda make that choice. We'll see what

655
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,390
Speaker 5:  the market decides. Like it's,

656
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,350
Speaker 4:  It's a real like bless their heart kind of response. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

657
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:55,060
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like if you know what that means, you're like

658
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,000
Speaker 5:  the one piece of news that's inside of there that was important. And I,

659
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,920
Speaker 5:  I hope sort of the EV community caught this, I asked him about the deal

660
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,680
Speaker 5:  terms to use the Tesla charger. 'cause Rivian is using N A CS

661
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,920
Speaker 5:  two and he said everyone thinks there's some like complicated data sharing

662
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,850
Speaker 5:  agreement. There's these conspiracy theories out there and there is not,

663
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,440
Speaker 5:  there is an agreement to use a charger and there's agreement to give us access

664
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,920
Speaker 5:  to their network and that's it. So there you go. I don't know what it's like

665
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,340
Speaker 5:  for everybody else, but he is like, like everyone else, we thought the charger

666
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,490
Speaker 5:  was better to use. The Biden administration did its

667
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,160
Speaker 5:  thing, it's like some tax scheme that requires them to basically open up

668
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,760
Speaker 5:  their network and then everyone rushed into use the charger and the network

669
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,500
Speaker 5:  because the conditions were there for us to go make a deal on not

670
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,470
Speaker 5:  honors terms.

671
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,960
Speaker 4:  Yeah, fair enough. It was good stuff. There's a ton of good stuff coming

672
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,480
Speaker 4:  out. We're gonna have a lot more, it'll be on the YouTube channel, it'll

673
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,160
Speaker 4:  be on podcasts all over the network. I

674
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,440
Speaker 5:  Did ask him about the, the single wiper. It's

675
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:46,700
Speaker 4:  A choice.

676
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,820
Speaker 6:  My death. Is that where he said, bless your heart.

677
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,760
Speaker 5:  No, that was, that was the second. It's a choice. I was like, do you think

678
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,040
Speaker 5:  this triangle's gonna destroy your business? And he was like, I don't know

679
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,980
Speaker 5:  man, don't no thank you. I was like, what about one big wiper?

680
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,100
Speaker 5:  And he was like, many people have faced say like it's,

681
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,960
Speaker 4:  You can have as many wipers as you want, you want. Alright, we need to take

682
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,720
Speaker 4:  a break and then we're gonna come back and Alex and I are gonna tell me lie

683
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,680
Speaker 4:  about everything else that happened this week. We'll be right

684
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,640
Speaker 4:  back.

685
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,400
Speaker 7:  Support for The Vergecast comes from Crucible Moments, a new podcast

686
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,250

701
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,350
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the other news of the week.

702
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,800
Speaker 4:  Alex, I'm gonna give you the choice. Do you wanna do the writer strike first

703
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,200
Speaker 4:  or do you wanna do Meta Connect first? Ooh,

704
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,020
Speaker 6:  I kind of wanna do Meta Connect first. I think both are really important,

705
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,720
Speaker 6:  but I wanna talk about some gadgets.

706
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,200
Speaker 4:  All right, let's do Meta. Three big things from Meta Connect, big annual

707
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,720
Speaker 4:  hardware event, The Quest three headset, the new Smart

708
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,680
Speaker 4:  Glasses and the just weird slew

709
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,040
Speaker 4:  of Ai AI stuff. Yeah, let's start with the headset. Well,

710
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,420
Speaker 5:  You don't want to start with tpa. I'm not,

711
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,920
Speaker 4:  I'm not ready for T-pain. I need like a minute before we get to T-Pain and

712
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,880
Speaker 4:  Snoop Dogg and Dwayne Wade pretending to be not Dwayne Wade. And

713
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,720
Speaker 4:  I don't understand what any of that actually, you know what, let's do that

714
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,000
Speaker 4:  right now. I'm angry.

715
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,480
Speaker 5:  I knew it. I knew it. It's like, do you want Tom Brady in your house not

716
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,560
Speaker 5:  being Tom Brady?

717
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,160
Speaker 4:  I don't, yeah, Alex. Will you just, will you just explain what Meta is doing

718
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,390
Speaker 4:  with all these chatbots?

719
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,320
Speaker 6:  Well, they assume you don't have any friends and that you

720
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,150
Speaker 6:  need artificial intelligence to be chat like your friend.

721
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,960
Speaker 6:  Basically. It's a bunch of chatbots, but the chatbots are designed to look

722
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,180
Speaker 6:  and sound like famous people. So there's like a Snoop

723
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,040
Speaker 6:  Dog dungeon master that they, he

724
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,980
Speaker 6:  tried to demo on stage. It didn't work. That was kind of unfortunate.

725
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,960
Speaker 6:  And, and that's basically the gist of it, right? Like the, these chat bots

726
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,880
Speaker 6:  are meant to just replicate people and build

727
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,560
Speaker 6:  these, like enhance those pair of social relationships you already have with

728
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,260
Speaker 6:  celebrities. And I really, really, really, really encourage you

729
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,270
Speaker 6:  to make more friends.

730
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:51,120
Speaker 5:  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me, let me offer you the flip of, let me offer

731
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,480
Speaker 5:  you the flip of this. So I was reading Casey's newsletter last

732
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,240
Speaker 5:  night and he was writing about the new version of

733
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,000
Speaker 5:  chat c p T, which can actually speak to you. He can play these characters,

734
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,920
Speaker 5:  it's multimodal, whatever. And he had this example in here, which

735
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,360
Speaker 5:  I had not really considered, but he is like a teenager, a young

736
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,720
Speaker 5:  trans teenager wrote into hard fork and was

737
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,680
Speaker 5:  like, I get affirmations every day from G p T. Like, it's the thing that

738
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,320
Speaker 5:  I talk to on this, like, right. And I, and that's an earlier

739
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,160
Speaker 5:  version. So I, there's, yeah, and his whole newsletter is basically

740
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,020
Speaker 5:  like, we're on the cusp of this being, these relationships being realer

741
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,520
Speaker 5:  and like, there's all the Silicon Valley baggage, there's all the endless

742
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,640
Speaker 5:  conversation with the movie her, all that stuff is in there, but he's like,

743
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,240
Speaker 5:  there's something here that is worth paying attention to. And that kind of

744
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,520
Speaker 5:  unlocked my brain when I was reading it. I don't know that I wanna be talking

745
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,160
Speaker 5:  to t Payne about, you know, like, but there's something in

746
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,000
Speaker 5:  there. What

747
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,800
Speaker 4:  You just described is kind of the story of community on the internet since

748
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,640
Speaker 4:  the beginning of the internet, right? Like,

749
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,520
Speaker 5:  Actually, wait, I want to take this back. I wanna be talking to TPA now that

750
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,360
Speaker 5:  I've, I'm very tired, but I just want it to be

751
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,200
Speaker 5:  actual T-pain, T-pain rules. Like, I just, like, there's no, you should watch

752
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,990
Speaker 5:  this podcast. He's amazing.

753
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,510
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no, T-pain is great. But no, I think the, the question of

754
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:10,320
Speaker 4:  like, where is your community on the web is a really

755
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,680
Speaker 4:  interesting and important one and is one people have been talking about for

756
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,600
Speaker 4:  25 years, right? Like, you go back far enough and there were people who

757
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,140
Speaker 4:  were like, oh, these kids are talking to other people online that's bad.

758
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,380
Speaker 4:  And we've like come to realize that that's like you, those relationships

759
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,130
Speaker 4:  are real and you that stuff is real. And then it turns

760
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,000
Speaker 4:  again once it's an AI thing. And I think that

761
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,520
Speaker 4:  changes the calculus a little bit. But there are versions of that that are

762
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,400
Speaker 4:  good and valuable and useful. I just think this thing Meta is

763
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,190
Speaker 4:  trying to do, which is not like build tools

764
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,000
Speaker 4:  that are good and useful and sort of human, but like make a thing

765
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,940
Speaker 4:  that looks like Dwayne Wade that will like help

766
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,740
Speaker 4:  me. Or like Snoop Dogg can be the DMM for

767
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,480
Speaker 4:  my Dungeons and Dragons games. Or like random celebrities

768
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,400
Speaker 4:  will help me cook. Like that to me feels like the uncanny valley of

769
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,700
Speaker 4:  all of this. Where it's just like we're, yeah, we're not anywhere with that.

770
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,590
Speaker 4:  To me.

771
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:09,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think what left me kind of like cold on it. 'cause I do

772
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,040
Speaker 6:  think right now I'm trying to play Dungeons and Dragons for the very first

773
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,840
Speaker 6:  time ever. And apparently it is very hard to get a bunch of people coordinated

774
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,640
Speaker 6:  in a room. So like, apparently that Snoop Dogg thing is actually really,

775
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,080
Speaker 6:  really good if you play Dungeons and Dragons. That seems like a really compelling

776
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,750
Speaker 6:  thing. But it just felt a lot like when when Alexa

777
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:30,720
Speaker 6:  started doing the voices, it felt, it feels like, like it, they just hit

778
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,460
Speaker 6:  me that same way of like, this feels like the technology's not ready

779
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,380
Speaker 6:  yet, so we're having to put like a celebrity layer on top of it

780
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,550
Speaker 6:  to get you to engage.

781
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,320
Speaker 5:  Well this is like the Meta thing. It's like we launched Threads, here's a

782
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,140
Speaker 5:  bunch of celebrities and, and then Yeah. And they've been backing into the,

783
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,640
Speaker 5:  the func the real functionality that will make it successful or

784
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,520
Speaker 5:  not. I I think that's this too. Yeah. Right. It's what

785
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,960
Speaker 5:  you want is I wanna talk to Tom Brady. I don't think anyone's ready, let

786
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,660
Speaker 5:  alone Tom Brady for like, you can just talk to me whenever you want. Right.

787
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,920
Speaker 5:  And that's dangerous if you're a celebrity in a lot of ways. Like

788
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,110
Speaker 5:  whatever. But hey, come play a character and

789
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:10,830
Speaker 5:  give life to a character that you can talk to with

790
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:13,920
Speaker 5:  some personality act. I think that's very safe for, it's just playing a role,

791
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,460
Speaker 5:  right?

792
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,400
Speaker 6:  To meta's credit. Like there's a big, there's like big K-pop groups that

793
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,190
Speaker 6:  already do this where you can go talk to an AI and

794
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:26,120
Speaker 6:  it's, it's like programmed to kind of be like the, the the K-pop

795
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,310
Speaker 6:  star you like. So, so it's out there. This stuff exists

796
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,730
Speaker 6:  already.

797
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,590
Speaker 5:  K-pop is always on the bleeding edge of being really weird. Yeah, right.

798
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:38,320
Speaker 4:  Also Alex, if you just spoke Apop as AI pop into

799
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,740
Speaker 4:  existence, I'm gonna be furious with you.

800
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,140
Speaker 6:  AI pop. It's coming. Apop.

801
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,880
Speaker 5:  All right, go watch V We have it on our site. Yeah, it's in a quick post

802
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,760
Speaker 5:  you, it's on Yeah. TPAs Instagram or it's on T-Pain TikTok. Go watch

803
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,120
Speaker 5:  the video. It's very strange. But I do

804
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,500
Speaker 4:  Think the more interesting piece of the AI thing is the, is the Meta

805
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,360
Speaker 4:  AI chatbot that they're putting out and putting into basically all of their

806
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,680
Speaker 4:  messaging platforms. You'll be able to get it everywhere. You use Meta

807
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,400
Speaker 4:  products and it's essentially chat g p T, like they're just turning on chat

808
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,860
Speaker 4:  g p t inside of Meta products.

809
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,640
Speaker 5:  No, it's, it's chat. GT is opening eye. They've turned This is their own

810
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,120
Speaker 5:  model. Yeah,

811
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,190
Speaker 4:  But it's like functionally it's, it's the same like the, the goal is

812
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:14,630
Speaker 5:  They think it's better. Yeah.

813
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:15,200
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

814
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,840
Speaker 5:  I don't know if it's

815
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,170
Speaker 4:  Better. I don't know if it's better either.

816
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:20,890
Speaker 6:  We've heard some people say it is, we've heard some people say it is a,

817
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,230
Speaker 6:  we'll just have to find out. Yeah,

818
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah. And they're big on Llama, which is their large language model.

819
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,400
Speaker 4:  Like there's the, this three headed triangle now. Like Amazon just made

820
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,920
Speaker 4:  this big investment in Anthropic. They're gonna do some really interesting

821
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,800
Speaker 4:  stuff over time. Microsoft and open AI are obviously together. Google is

822
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,700
Speaker 4:  doing its own thing and now Meta is doing its own thing and like this race

823
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,600
Speaker 4:  is getting real and really expensive and really high stakes for all four

824
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,880
Speaker 4:  of these companies really Fasts.

825
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,360
Speaker 6:  Really? Yeah. And they're doing art generation too. It's not just, it's not

826
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,390
Speaker 6:  just words like there's gonna be a bunch of stickers where you can just like

827
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,550
Speaker 6:  make something up and do that. And that I'm actually very excited about because

828
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,990
Speaker 6:  like the possibility for trolling my friends is extraordinarily

829
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,560
Speaker 6:  high when I can just make AI generate horrible art for

830
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,190
Speaker 6:  me.

831
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,540
Speaker 5:  Wait, can I say some like deeply diverge Cassie thing about that?

832
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,390
Speaker 6:  No.

833
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,670
Speaker 4:  What is a sticker?

834
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:11,130
Speaker 5:  What is a sticker? The reason that stickers and

835
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,000
Speaker 5:  memes and reaction gifs and all that stuff is

836
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,640
Speaker 5:  powerful is because they have shared meaning. Yep, yep. Right. So like you,

837
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,620
Speaker 5:  you're like, here's a gif, and like it means something and it carries a whole

838
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:26,080
Speaker 5:  layers and layers of meaning. When you share it with a friend in response

839
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,980
Speaker 5:  to something else, I'm gonna AI generate some stuff

840
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,840
Speaker 5:  for you. De novo, like over and over again, does not carry that

841
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,380
Speaker 5:  meaning. It's just you talking, it's just you being like, I made up words.

842
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,360
Speaker 6:  You say that, but if you make a horrible enough one, it can

843
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,860
Speaker 6:  be a beam.

844
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,840
Speaker 5:  No, it's true. It it's just like, I, I don't want to, there's a part of this

845
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,440
Speaker 5:  where it's like endlessly customizing everything actually

846
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,760
Speaker 5:  detracts from how we communicate. Yeah.

847
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,870
Speaker 6:  Fractures. The fractures, the communication.

848
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:56,920
Speaker 5:  Well it's just like, it's at the dumbest

849
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,630
Speaker 5:  level. It's like now I have to explain all my jokes to you.

850
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,960
Speaker 5:  Like I made up a joke and I have to explain it to you instead of repeating

851
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,760
Speaker 5:  it or riffing on a thing that already exists is, I know, I know

852
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,500
Speaker 5:  we got some PhDs in our audience who are full of this information.

853
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,360
Speaker 5:  Our, our co-founder and friend Dieter bone deep into

854
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,240
Speaker 5:  semiotics. Like the, the meaning of meaning. This is it. It's like

855
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,200
Speaker 5:  right in there. It's like what if the AI is making up ways for

856
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,760
Speaker 5:  you to communicate that the person on the other end has no context for

857
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,670
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And, but like it, it's stickers like it,

858
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:33,540
Speaker 5:  it's fine. People aren't gonna use, that's what I'm trying to get at is like

859
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,080
Speaker 5:  if you don't, if you don't get to free ride on the history of meaning, like

860
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,280
Speaker 5:  the stickers are just silly stickers.

861
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's, there's a big giant like huge cultural question

862
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,340
Speaker 4:  in all of that. Right? This everything is becoming endlessly personalized

863
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:49,120
Speaker 4:  versus we need things that everyone understands in

864
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,400
Speaker 4:  order to communicate about them, which is why the office is so useful. I

865
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,270
Speaker 4:  realized the other day that like most of the screenshots in on my phone are

866
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:59,320
Speaker 4:  gifs from the office that I just use for infinite purposes. Yeah. All the

867
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,080
Speaker 4:  time. There's a why are you the way that you are a gif that I just use 50

868
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,380
Speaker 4:  times a day and people understand it, it's great. It's very helpful.

869
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,230
Speaker 5:  Do you know those people whose entire personalities as movie quotes? Yeah.

870
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:12,400
Speaker 5:  Like they're not gonna be out there generating stickers, you

871
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,760
Speaker 6:  Know? That's very true. They're a dying breed. 'cause we don't share that

872
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,660
Speaker 6:  cult, like everybody watches their own things now. So that shared culture

873
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,620
Speaker 6:  is is is dying down to Barbie movie, which is great Barbie movie. Wonderful.

874
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,920
Speaker 6:  But like fewer places of commonality.

875
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,040
Speaker 4:  You're saying people don't run around quoting Oppenheimer to each other all

876
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,520
Speaker 4:  day. Yeah. Why

877
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,260
Speaker 6:  Not? Not, it's not, what's up with that?

878
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,160
Speaker 5:  I'm become deaf. That's, I'm just gonna start sending that to

879
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,880
Speaker 5:  The Verge staff every day.

880
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,760
Speaker 4:  I love it. Alex tell me about The Quest three. Tell Neli

881
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,360
Speaker 4:  about The Quest three. We've been wondering about this thing. We kind of

882
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,400
Speaker 4:  knew what it was. Daylight.

883
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:44,720
Speaker 6:  It's cool.

884
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,580
Speaker 4:  What are we, what's going on? It's,

885
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:50,360
Speaker 5:  It looks bananas. Like I was looking at the photo of Addie wearing this thing

886
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,640
Speaker 5:  and I was like, I dunno,

887
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,280
Speaker 6:  I love it. Like we were talking about this in, in Slack the other day and

888
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,520
Speaker 6:  people were like, I hate it. It looks alien. And I'm like, that's exactly

889
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,350
Speaker 6:  why I love it because it looks kind of alien. It's got, it's got these three

890
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:05,320
Speaker 6:  like little ovals on the front and they look

891
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,240
Speaker 6:  kind of like the iPhone 10 camera module. So it looks like

892
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,200
Speaker 6:  they slapped three of those on there, which feels very like old fashioned

893
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,300
Speaker 6:  and kind of Oh, I've seen that before. But then somehow,

894
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,910
Speaker 5:  And this is, well this is in the service of room tracking of pass through.

895
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:19,200
Speaker 5:  It's

896
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,660
Speaker 6:  $500. It's got dual

897
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,220
Speaker 6:  2064 by 2208

898
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:30,200
Speaker 6:  pixels. So it's a much higher resolution than, than the previous one,

899
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,800
Speaker 6:  which was only 1832 by 1920. Like it's gonna be a little

900
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,440
Speaker 6:  sharper and it's got the, the second generation of the

901
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,880
Speaker 6:  Snapdragon XR two processor in it. And that's where a lot of the big stuff

902
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,680
Speaker 6:  changes. So I think like probably the most notable thing, and the thing that

903
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,520
Speaker 6:  that Addie talked about in her hands-on was that the graphics are

904
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,350
Speaker 6:  better on this thing. Like it's, it's, it's, it's things are sharper.

905
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:55,340
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The resolution's a little higher. Sean was very excited.

906
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,500
Speaker 5:  No one else has this frame of reference 'cause zero people bought a Quest

907
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,280
Speaker 5:  Pro, but I I have one. Is it better than The Quest Pro or worse than The

908
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,000
Speaker 5:  Quest Pro? 'cause Quest Pro is pretty good. Probably

909
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,180
Speaker 6:  About better

910
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,910
Speaker 5:  The software disaster where the hardware is,

911
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,790
Speaker 4:  It's Yeah. From a, from a pure like display

912
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:14,190
Speaker 4:  quality perspective, it's better than The Quest Pro. Really?

913
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:17,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's actually, it's the highest res thing they've

914
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,500
Speaker 4:  made including The Quest Pro. The, the ongoing existence of The Quest

915
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,160
Speaker 4:  Pro does not make any sense.

916
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,100
Speaker 5:  I So what we should note here is that Alex Heath interviewed

917
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,360
Speaker 5:  Zuckerberg on our site for in the Deco feed. He did. And I think he asked

918
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,190
Speaker 5:  me The Quest Pro and Zucker was like, I got it. Yeah.

919
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:37,080
Speaker 4:  It's like we just had a bunch around. We had to ship them. But no, it's very

920
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,920
Speaker 4:  clear that this is the one Yeah. That Meta would like to sell you. I mean,

921
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,440
Speaker 4:  Zuckerberg kept saying, and even Andrew Bosworth, the C T O afterwards kept

922
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,430
Speaker 4:  saying this is the first mainstream mixed reality headset.

923
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:51,900
Speaker 4:  Like that is their phrase. Right. And they're coming after Apple's Vision

924
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,400
Speaker 4:  Pro in a really big way. They made a bunch of jokes about how it doesn't

925
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,150
Speaker 4:  have a cable or a battery pack. Yeah. Which is honestly like a really good

926
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:02,120
Speaker 4:  burn of the Vision Pro. Yep. It's also not $3,500. So that's

927
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:06,080
Speaker 4:  good. But that is, that is the pitch that they're making. They're like,

928
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,520
Speaker 4:  this is the one, it's not finished. This is not where we're ultimately

929
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,880
Speaker 4:  headed. Ultimately where we're headed I think they think is, is these smart

930
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,580
Speaker 4:  Glasses, which we should also talk about. But this is the

931
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:20,430
Speaker 4:  one that is for regular humans now.

932
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:20,870
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

933
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:24,200
Speaker 5:  It's the end of this form factor. Right. Or like the best version of this

934
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,430
Speaker 5:  form factor you can get right now.

935
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:29,200
Speaker 4:  Yeah, exactly. And I think they continue to struggle to make the

936
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,500
Speaker 4:  case for why people would want this. Like a lot of what they talked about

937
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,080
Speaker 4:  was video games. They have more games, they have better games, there's stuff

938
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,800
Speaker 4:  to do, but then they occasionally just throw in, you

939
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,760
Speaker 4:  know, Meta Quest for business, but don't really

940
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,640
Speaker 4:  explain that. They're just like, you can have it if you want it for

941
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,600
Speaker 4:  business. That's, that's all we know about that. They talk a little

942
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,400
Speaker 4:  bit about it as an entertainment device, which I think is interesting. Like

943
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,760
Speaker 4:  they, they show the same screenshot that everybody shows, which is just like

944
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,680
Speaker 4:  you can watch, instead of watching one N B A game, you can watch seven

945
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,520
Speaker 4:  N b A games on virtual screens. Yeah. You And that is like extremely my

946
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,340
Speaker 4:  shit. But like I didn't get the sense that there is some sort of brand

947
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:10,190
Speaker 4:  new life changing use case for this. It just seems like between

948
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:14,180
Speaker 4:  pass through better screens and just sort of an overall

949
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,760
Speaker 4:  better experience of using the thing. That's

950
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,600
Speaker 5:  Great though. I just wanna be like going from the iPhone three gss, the iPhone

951
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,100
Speaker 5:  four and getting a red retina display is like great.

952
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,840
Speaker 4:  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. And, and I've, a bunch of us got a demo of

953
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,720
Speaker 4:  this. I, mine was relatively short but I still got to play a couple of the

954
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,430
Speaker 4:  games and stuff. It is, I mean, leaps and bounds better

955
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:37,150
Speaker 4:  than The Quest two, like the, the pass through is is not perfect.

956
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:41,020
Speaker 4:  It's a little sort of, it's a little sort of Warpy like the floor

957
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,590
Speaker 4:  was moving a little bit, but

958
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:43,940
Speaker 6:  It's better than the Pro

959
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:47,440
Speaker 4:  Oh better than the Pro Way better than The Quest two, which is like black

960
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,560
Speaker 4:  and white and essentially doesn't actually work as pass through. Not as good

961
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,240
Speaker 4:  as the demo I got at the Vision of the Vision Pro. But that was super controlled.

962
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,110
Speaker 4:  Who knows what that'll be like in real life. But yeah, this is a

963
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:00,560
Speaker 4:  massive improvement over The Quest too. Whether it will make people who didn't

964
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,960
Speaker 4:  care about headsets, care about headsets to me is still the open question.

965
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,120
Speaker 4:  Right. Like that's what I don't know. But if you're a person who cares about

966
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,280
Speaker 4:  headsets gigantic upgrade,

967
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,110
Speaker 6:  I kind of think it didn't sell itself well enough. Like,

968
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:15,420
Speaker 6:  like talking to Addie, talking to you, talking to people who got to actually

969
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,280
Speaker 6:  try the thing was much more compelling than to me than watching the

970
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,440
Speaker 6:  actual keynote about the product.

971
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,660
Speaker 5:  I think this is gonna be true for every VR headset, including the Vision

972
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,340
Speaker 5:  Pro forever. Yeah.

973
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,120
Speaker 6:  And well that's just very interesting to me 'cause Addie like told me about

974
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,560
Speaker 6:  it and she's like, oh yeah, the pastor is way, way, way better. And I was

975
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,520
Speaker 6:  like, oh dang, I kinda want it just for that. That sounds really cool. And

976
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,210
Speaker 6:  then I don't see any of that on stage and I'm like, well I'm glad

977
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:41,580
Speaker 6:  Addie told me.

978
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:45,440
Speaker 4:  It really is one of the great unsolved problems of VR is how to show

979
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,850
Speaker 4:  someone what you're seeing in VR in a way that looks at all

980
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:52,480
Speaker 4:  compelling. 'cause your options are either like show it on the two screens,

981
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,240
Speaker 4:  one's for each eye, which just doesn't make any sense to anybody. Or you

982
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,200
Speaker 4:  just show it like a like slightly low res television. It's like this doesn't

983
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,560
Speaker 4:  mean anything to anybody. Yeah. And I, I've been hearing this from people

984
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,720
Speaker 4:  in this space for like damn near a decade now that they're like, when we

985
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,560
Speaker 4:  put this on someone's head, they get it. Yeah. And until you

986
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,360
Speaker 4:  put it on someone's head, it is so hard to explain what it is

987
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,700
Speaker 4:  about it that works.

988
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,970
Speaker 5:  The only things I've ever seen do you know, there's people who play Beat

989
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:22,960
Speaker 5:  Saber and they feel entire green screen rooms. Yeah. And so like

990
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,600
Speaker 5:  they, they're doing like real life overlays. Yeah. They, everyone's just

991
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,760
Speaker 5:  gotta do that. That's, that's my feeling. But the problem is like so many

992
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,160
Speaker 5:  things are like sitting and using a computer like Quest for business is

993
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,840
Speaker 5:  like now you'll, you'll excel. It's like this

994
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,750
Speaker 5:  sucks. Yes.

995
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,140
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Very large Excel

996
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,480
Speaker 6:  And the price doesn't, I think the big problem is the price doesn't help.

997
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,520
Speaker 6:  Like one of the reasons The Quest two was so compelling was you're like,

998
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,880
Speaker 6:  wow, I can get this for $300 when it was first announced. Right. And they've

999
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,450
Speaker 6:  now dropped that price back down to $300 after like a brief time of

1000
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:57,320
Speaker 6:  increasing the price and so little, little

1001
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:01,300
Speaker 6:  wave there. And that was really compelling. Like I went out and bought it

1002
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,040
Speaker 6:  the day it was announced 'cause it was like that price is so low. I didn't

1003
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,120
Speaker 6:  get the $300 one, I spent more money but I was still like, wow, I'm getting

1004
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,680
Speaker 6:  such a deal. This is great. And then this one is still $500. That's the same

1005
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,510
Speaker 6:  price as a PSS five or an Xbox. Yeah.

1006
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:17,260
Speaker 5:  This is very hard to justify as an impulse purchase

1007
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:21,180
Speaker 5:  at Christmas. The way that I think a lot of Quest twos got sold

1008
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,760
Speaker 5:  is sort of like, what tech present? Am I buying the kids for Christmas?

1009
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,500
Speaker 5:  Because it was like that, the lower number.

1010
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,280
Speaker 6:  And I think that's gonna harm adoption 'cause 'cause of that fact that you

1011
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,620
Speaker 6:  have to put it on, you have to try it or you have to know somebody who

1012
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,380
Speaker 6:  has to really be compelled by it.

1013
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,240
Speaker 5:  Or it actually, I, I think what makes it even harder is it's like

1014
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,200
Speaker 5:  not a console generation, right? It's not PS four to PSS five. A lot of people

1015
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,160
Speaker 5:  have Quest twos 'cause of what happened last Christmas and the Christmas

1016
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,840
Speaker 5:  before it. Yeah. And it's like, oh that's just sitting on the shelf.

1017
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,240
Speaker 4:  Although, I don't know, I think this one is gonna be a little bit tough because

1018
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,120
Speaker 4:  I think the The Quest three is gonna make

1019
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,840
Speaker 4:  The Quest four a console generation because what it's gonna do, like

1020
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,720
Speaker 4:  everybody's gonna spend the next year building actually usable mixed reality

1021
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,440
Speaker 4:  stuff because for the first time it's worth doing. Like the pass through

1022
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,760
Speaker 4:  stuff is good enough and

1023
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,040
Speaker 5:  The Vision Pro is there, right?

1024
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,130
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And so we're, we're now gonna get to a point where there is an actual

1025
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:19,360
Speaker 4:  generation of stuff to do that takes advantage of this tech. Whereas right

1026
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:23,180
Speaker 4:  now it's like a lot of the reason for the mixed reality

1027
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:26,920
Speaker 4:  is, and they even pitch it this way so that like I can find my

1028
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,760
Speaker 4:  coffee cup or look at my phone without taking my headset off. Which

1029
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,680
Speaker 4:  is useful. It's a bad reason to buy a product. And

1030
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,390
Speaker 4:  so there just hasn't, they need the thing and that

1031
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:41,320
Speaker 4:  will come and it can come now, which is really exciting. But I think it's

1032
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,120
Speaker 4:  gonna make, it's gonna make the selling point for next year's model much

1033
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,960
Speaker 4:  easier. But I don't know how much it does for like right now. Do

1034
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,520
Speaker 6:  You think it'll be next year's model? Yeah. Or do you think they'll wait

1035
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,160
Speaker 6:  a few years? That's the problem is I don't think they're, I think they're

1036
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,900
Speaker 6:  still at console level, not at phone level in encouraging upgrade

1037
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:01,600
Speaker 6:  cycles. And I think if they, that could be true. Release a new one next

1038
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,120
Speaker 6:  year. It's just gonna be like, well why? Like at what point do

1039
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,480
Speaker 6:  I actually invest in this very expensive thing that isn't always reliably

1040
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,440
Speaker 6:  backwards compatible that is like growing each year by these

1041
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,160
Speaker 6:  leaps and bounds. Shouldn't I just wait until next year? Shouldn't I just

1042
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,800
Speaker 6:  wait until next year? Shouldn't I just wait for another price drop? Yeah.

1043
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,000
Speaker 6:  But I think they need to be a little more thoughtful about how they're marketing

1044
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,710
Speaker 6:  this thing and and pricing it. But I still also

1045
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,030
Speaker 6:  kind of want one.

1046
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:26,350
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

1047
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:29,020
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's about right. And I think that's like the best case scenario

1048
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:29,390
Speaker 5:  for them.

1049
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:32,680
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It is. Like Christmas, somebody gives me like a little Best Buy gift

1050
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,800
Speaker 6:  card. I'm like, yeah,

1051
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,230
Speaker 5:  Somebody wants to throw me 500 bucks, you know, maybe I'm not equest,

1052
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,060
Speaker 6:  I'll spend it, spend it not on Legos.

1053
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,860
Speaker 4:  It, it seems clear that what Meta did here was say

1054
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,720
Speaker 4:  we have to stop building the best possible cheap thing and just

1055
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,690
Speaker 4:  build a thing that's really good and then charge what we have to. I think

1056
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:55,000
Speaker 4:  Apple went the same route to like the nth

1057
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,960
Speaker 4:  degree, but Meta has been on this path and like Snap has

1058
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,840
Speaker 4:  been doing this and others have been doing this where they're like, these

1059
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,360
Speaker 4:  things have to be cheap. They have to be impulse buys. You have to be able

1060
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,120
Speaker 4:  to buy 'em for Christmas and we're gonna make them as good as we can and

1061
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,390
Speaker 4:  they'll get better and better over time. And that hasn't really worked because

1062
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:13,360
Speaker 4:  it's still not possible to make a really good one for that price. I don't

1063
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:17,320
Speaker 4:  have any reporting to back this up, but I would bet good money that

1064
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,000
Speaker 4:  this hardware is not going to be earth shatteringly high margin for

1065
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,600
Speaker 4:  Meta. These things are expensive to build and hard to

1066
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,430
Speaker 4:  build. And I think Meta was smart to say

1067
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:31,880
Speaker 4:  like, this is the bar for what quality is and we just have to charge what

1068
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,700
Speaker 4:  it costs to build this and yeah, let that get cheaper over time

1069
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:39,280
Speaker 4:  as opposed to like, hoping quality goes up over time because that I just

1070
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,420
Speaker 4:  don't think has worked so far. Yeah.

1071
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,120
Speaker 6:  It looks cool

1072
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,400
Speaker 5:  Though. And this is, by the way, we should talk about the heath interview

1073
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,660
Speaker 5:  with Zuck. Yeah. Zuck makes this point, right? Like making things smaller

1074
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,460
Speaker 5:  and cheaper is actually very hard. And he, he, there's a,

1075
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,220
Speaker 5:  we we can even watch the, we should go watch the whole thing. It's great.

1076
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,360
Speaker 5:  But we have a TikTok app where he is like, people are impressed by the pyramids

1077
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,680
Speaker 5:  but it's actually small things that are

1078
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,740
Speaker 6:  More impressive.

1079
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,740
Speaker 4:  The beginning of his history channel show.

1080
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,520
Speaker 5:  One more thing I I wanna, I wanna bring up out of the heath interview. The

1081
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,710
Speaker 5:  heath interview is great. Mark is super loose, super

1082
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:12,400
Speaker 5:  relaxed, talks a lot about building products, actually he's relaxed about

1083
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,280
Speaker 5:  two things. It's building products. He's like back in builder mode and he's

1084
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,990
Speaker 5:  like, this is what's great. Like the last few years I've needed to be like

1085
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:22,040
Speaker 5:  this First Amendment scholar, statesman person person. But like now I'm building

1086
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,320
Speaker 5:  shit again. And he can tell how loose and then he is super loose when he

1087
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,820
Speaker 5:  talks about beating people up

1088
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,050
Speaker 6:  So loose.

1089
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:32,520
Speaker 5:  Loves it, just loves hitting a guy. And that's like great. It's like this

1090
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:36,320
Speaker 5:  is the most personality. But he loves like m M A as a sport, not just

1091
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,760
Speaker 5:  like streak fight. Just be clear, I'm very

1092
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,510
Speaker 5:  tired.

1093
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,460
Speaker 6:  He's just out there punching people on the street.

1094
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:45,920
Speaker 5:  But he like talks about it and he talks about how the skill and discipline

1095
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,320
Speaker 5:  and they're like, you can see he's relaxed, like he's back in his zone as

1096
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,240
Speaker 5:  opposed to Senator we sell ads, you know

1097
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,200
Speaker 5:  like, and there's a lot of talking with The Quest three and

1098
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,640
Speaker 5:  building that and what they've learned and all this stuff. There's a lot

1099
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,220
Speaker 5:  talking about building Threads and how excited that's made him

1100
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,120
Speaker 5:  and one more confirmation that they're definitely gonna decentralize and

1101
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,240
Speaker 5:  federate Threads, which I think is really

1102
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,560
Speaker 4:  Cool. Yeah. And he made the case you would hope he would make, which is that

1103
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:14,240
Speaker 4:  like we think that the future of social, we have to give

1104
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,240
Speaker 4:  people confidence that these things are going to be around. And it's like,

1105
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,330
Speaker 4:  yes Mark, where have you been for 20 years?

1106
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:22,880
Speaker 5:  Right? He's like, we've thought about doing a Facebook but Facebook is too

1107
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,660
Speaker 5:  complicated so you have to do it from the beginning, which is like cool,

1108
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,790
Speaker 5:  you know, and

1109
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:30,680
Speaker 4:  True. Like I think that's a re like re-architecting Facebook for

1110
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,030
Speaker 4:  activity pub is probably not possible. It's just,

1111
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,240
Speaker 4:  yeah. Can

1112
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,140
Speaker 6:  We talk about the coolest part of the Beta connect?

1113
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:42,040
Speaker 4:  Was it how ripped Mark Zuckerberg was? I said it like three times as we were

1114
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,880
Speaker 4:  sitting watching the live stream. Like I cannot believe how shredded this

1115
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,710
Speaker 4:  dude is.

1116
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:48,800
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like we, I think we were all just quietly slacking each other just

1117
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,970
Speaker 6:  being like Yoel. Wow. Yeah,

1118
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,030
Speaker 5:  It sucks Yoed It

1119
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:55,830
Speaker 6:  Was the Glasses, the Glasses were something that I think hearing about

1120
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:58,430
Speaker 6:  them, it was the opposite of The Quest three. Somebody would tell me about

1121
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:00,910
Speaker 6:  The Quest three and I'd be like, oh that sounds really, really cool. But

1122
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:04,390
Speaker 6:  I'd watch the demo and I'd be like, that's eh. And then this one I'd watch

1123
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:08,150
Speaker 6:  the demo for the Glasses and be like, eh. And then they talk about the Glasses.

1124
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:11,510
Speaker 6:  I was like, actually these, these sound cool. Like I want these Glasses

1125
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:14,770
Speaker 4:  Convince me I have been back and forth on this a million times. Smart Glasses

1126
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:18,750
Speaker 4:  to me are either a thing that everyone should have immediately or an objectively

1127
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:21,990
Speaker 4:  stupid idea that just should not exist. And I genuinely go between them 10

1128
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,830
Speaker 4:  times a day. Convince me they're cool. Yeah,

1129
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:27,110
Speaker 6:  I I I do too. 'cause I have to wear Glasses and I don't wanna go

1130
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,790
Speaker 6:  like get new lenses for these

1131
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:33,390
Speaker 6:  $300 frames, which is probably the same price as most frames

1132
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:37,260
Speaker 6:  anyway. Like that price isn't that different. But

1133
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,650
Speaker 6:  they, they were good looking. And then the woman that did the presentation

1134
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:44,550
Speaker 6:  for was like, had such good energy. Oh yeah. She was so

1135
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:47,790
Speaker 6:  excited to be there and talk about these Glasses that I was

1136
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:50,870
Speaker 6:  like, are they really awesome? Yeah, these seem

1137
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:54,710
Speaker 6:  awesome. And I think it was like the camera, it was just like the,

1138
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:57,750
Speaker 6:  the, the way the cameras work, the camera's much higher quality than it has

1139
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:01,670
Speaker 6:  been previously. I don't think I, I can't think of a practical use case for

1140
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:04,690
Speaker 6:  these Glasses. 'cause they, they've got the, they've got the audio in them,

1141
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:08,610
Speaker 6:  so, so you'll be able to hear stuff and you'll be able to like

1142
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:12,490
Speaker 6:  use your phone to ask it. You can ask it questions and the

1143
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:15,410
Speaker 6:  the responses will pop up on your phone and that seems like kind of cool

1144
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:19,190
Speaker 6:  and moving towards that mixed reality thing. And then it's got the, the

1145
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:22,800
Speaker 6:  cameras that will, that will like stream to Threads and stream to, to

1146
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,160
Speaker 6:  Instagram and do all of that. And that seems really, really cool. And I don't

1147
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,840
Speaker 6:  think I actually wanna be that connected to other people. But at the same

1148
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,540
Speaker 6:  time part of me was like, but don't I

1149
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:36,120
Speaker 4:  So thi this is actually the exact, like, it was weird tension that I have

1150
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,960
Speaker 4:  been feeling too. And Neil, I've been wondering all week about you because

1151
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,860
Speaker 4:  I remember when you first had a kid,

1152
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:46,640
Speaker 4:  one of the things that you did pretty quickly was buy a point and shoot camera

1153
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,320
Speaker 4:  because you were like, I wanna take a lot of pictures, I wanna document a

1154
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,960
Speaker 4:  lot of stuff, but I don't want to have my phone in front of my face all the

1155
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,600
Speaker 4:  time. For lots of obvious reasons. And that is the exact use case

1156
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,440
Speaker 4:  that all of these companies make for smart Glasses. Like there are

1157
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,880
Speaker 4:  kids in the demo reel for every single one of these. Right? Always. Always.

1158
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,180
Speaker 4:  'cause like you can have both hands, you can swing your kid around whatever,

1159
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:09,040
Speaker 4:  but you, you are less, there's not so much of a thing between

1160
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,560
Speaker 4:  you and especially not a thing that is otherwise trying to grab your attention.

1161
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:11,980
Speaker 4:  Well there's

1162
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,050
Speaker 5:  One thing between you and your kid, you're wearing

1163
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,700
Speaker 5:  sunglasses.

1164
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,620
Speaker 6:  You can get them in regular frame

1165
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:22,190
Speaker 4:  Get with prescription lenses.

1166
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:24,140
Speaker 5:  There's like, there's, there's one thing

1167
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:27,040
Speaker 4:  You can get transition lenses. My dad wears transitions. They're

1168
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,150
Speaker 4:  fine.

1169
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:31,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah, your dad and like every fourth grader who just got their first pair

1170
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,120
Speaker 5:  of Glasses, I was that child. That boy was me. It

1171
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:39,040
Speaker 5:  was not cool. My friends, everyone, someone please go to fourth

1172
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,380
Speaker 5:  grades across the country and tell these children

1173
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:44,860
Speaker 4:  Wow. This is, this is Joey Slater that I will not tolerate. Sorry

1174
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,040
Speaker 4:  dad.

1175
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,880
Speaker 6:  I had an adult person try to help me to get transition

1176
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,420
Speaker 6:  Glasses recently.

1177
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:55,150
Speaker 5:  No, it's fine. Once you've like a achieved in life. Yeah,

1178
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:55,440
Speaker 6:  It's

1179
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,680
Speaker 5:  Okay. You can have transition lessons. I

1180
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:56,940
Speaker 4:  See. Okay.

1181
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,400
Speaker 6:  That's what that was. That was the case made to me. They're like, no, no,

1182
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,790
Speaker 6:  you're, you're, you can do it now. You're an adult.

1183
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:05,080
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's your children are at the house, you're married, you got a grandkid.

1184
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:09,050
Speaker 5:  You're like, yeah, just take a load off bro. Just have sunglasses

1185
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:12,960
Speaker 5:  ready to go when you're in fourth grade. It's not just

1186
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,120
Speaker 5:  tell the children

1187
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,120
Speaker 6:  They're just gray all the time. These little kids in gray

1188
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,660
Speaker 6:  lenses.

1189
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:22,520
Speaker 5:  It was so weird. 1980s in Wisconsin. Anyway, yes, this is the argument. The

1190
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,360
Speaker 5:  problem is the camera's any good, but my RX 100 is a great camera.

1191
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,750
Speaker 5:  That's why I bought it. My iPhone is a

1192
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:32,760
Speaker 5:  extremely complicated philosophical quandary of a

1193
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:36,720
Speaker 5:  camera. That's why I have it. This is like, I'll have it, I'll get my

1194
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,360
Speaker 5:  hands back, but I'm gonna take shittier photos. Who doesn't love

1195
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,320
Speaker 5:  12 megapixel single non H D R photos. People

1196
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:48,020
Speaker 6:  Love it More than five megapixels, which was the previous one.

1197
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:51,020
Speaker 5:  That's true. And that's true. I haven't seen the photos, but that's always,

1198
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:54,280
Speaker 5:  to me it's like, you know, what's the the phrase the best camera's, the one

1199
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,510
Speaker 5:  you have with you. I always have an amazing camera with me.

1200
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:58,600
Speaker 6:  Your Glasses, right?

1201
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,420
Speaker 5:  I i my Glasses my transition lenses. I know I always,

1202
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:06,280
Speaker 5:  my phone's around, you know, and I, I bought a really nice

1203
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:10,200
Speaker 5:  camera so I could divest myself of the phone. But I don't

1204
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,930
Speaker 5:  think having a more convenient camera. I dunno,

1205
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:17,810
Speaker 5:  maybe I haven't seen the photos. I haven't like used a thing again,

1206
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:21,620
Speaker 5:  blind reacts to the, the right hand Glasses.

1207
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:25,560
Speaker 5:  But you know, I, I don't know. Like it's, it's more technology and when

1208
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:29,150
Speaker 5:  I was what David, to your point, I was after less.

1209
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:33,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I think, I think to me like, it's very clear that Meta

1210
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,840
Speaker 4:  does not see these smart Glasses as like the end point of smart

1211
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,820
Speaker 4:  Glasses, right? Yeah. Like at the end of Connect Mark, Dr. Berg got up and

1212
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:44,800
Speaker 4:  did the like almost sort of Steve Jobs impression of like, you

1213
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,080
Speaker 4:  know, when he was like, it's a widescreen iPod, it's a phone, it's an internet

1214
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,360
Speaker 4:  communicator. And he was like, he showed it, he was like, we have The Quest

1215
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,800
Speaker 4:  three headset, we have all this AI communication

1216
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,720
Speaker 4:  stuff and Then, we have smart Glasses. And the case he

1217
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,480
Speaker 4:  made is that like the end state of this is that the first two things, The,

1218
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:05,210
Speaker 4:  Quest and the AI stuff are going to end up in the Glasses,

1219
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:07,840
Speaker 4:  right? Yeah. Like he's like, this is the form factor and we're gonna pull

1220
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,570
Speaker 4:  this stuff into it over time. And I

1221
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:14,520
Speaker 4:  don't know how long that's gonna take or if that's ever gonna happen, but

1222
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:18,240
Speaker 4:  I believe them that that's the vision. And I think the question we've been

1223
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,920
Speaker 4:  asking for a bunch of years now is like, is there anything interesting along

1224
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,600
Speaker 4:  the way? Yeah. And to me, just purely from a personal

1225
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,140
Speaker 4:  perspective, the cameras don't do anything for me. Partly because I think

1226
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:31,980
Speaker 4:  the like real world creepiness factor is still really real.

1227
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:34,240
Speaker 4:  And I don't, I don't know how to sort through that even. It's very high.

1228
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's just like, even just like walking around, like if you just walk

1229
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,400
Speaker 4:  around a city just holding up your phone, like you might be

1230
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,800
Speaker 4:  taking a pic, you're gonna creep people out, right? It's like whether or

1231
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,520
Speaker 4:  not you're actually doing anything, it feels bad. And so I have not sorted

1232
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:50,340
Speaker 4:  through how to deal with that. But I do think the, the thing

1233
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:54,180
Speaker 4:  I'm most excited to see about these Glasses is whether

1234
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:58,000
Speaker 4:  the mic and headphones are good because it's

1235
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,880
Speaker 4:  essentially they're trying to do this like personal audio speaker thing where

1236
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,660
Speaker 4:  you can hear it but nobody else can. It has five mics in the Glasses, including

1237
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,960
Speaker 4:  one on your nose that's supposed to do a better job of picking up your voice,

1238
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,590
Speaker 4:  which makes sense. If that works. That's pretty

1239
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:14,110
Speaker 4:  cool. I don't like being a person who wears

1240
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:17,520
Speaker 4:  AirPods all the time. I would like to be a person who wears AirPods

1241
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:21,340
Speaker 4:  less. And so if that's the kind of thing that I can use, like if

1242
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:25,200
Speaker 4:  I'm out on a walk or whatever, that's compelling to

1243
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,060
Speaker 4:  me. But also like it's whatever, it's 250 bucks am I gonna

1244
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:32,600
Speaker 4:  buy, I don't wear Glasses anyway. If I already wore Glasses, I think I would

1245
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,560
Speaker 4:  be slowly talking myself into this. But as somebody who doesn't otherwise

1246
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:39,280
Speaker 4:  wear Glasses, that's a big leap.

1247
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,120
Speaker 6:  I mean that, that's, that's why I'm like, ooh, I like, maybe I

1248
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,800
Speaker 6:  should get a pair of these the next time I go get my prescription updated.

1249
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,470
Speaker 4:  I mean a pair of wayfarers is like $165. You're not that far

1250
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,920
Speaker 4:  away to add all this other stuff.

1251
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,920
Speaker 5:  I, we're all learning an important lesson about the amount of margin containing

1252
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,070
Speaker 4:  Yeah. A pair of wayfarers. Yeah.

1253
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:01,600
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Maybe this is gonna drop, start dropping the prices of regular

1254
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,440
Speaker 6:  Glasses.

1255
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:06,320
Speaker 5:  I only buy $20 sunglasses 'cause I lose them. And I think I've, I just realized,

1256
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,390
Speaker 5:  I came to my conclusion

1257
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:10,920
Speaker 4:  Same. I bought one nice pair of sunglasses and I said, if I lose these

1258
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,100
Speaker 4:  within a year, I'm never allowed to buy nice sunglasses again. I lost them

1259
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:18,060
Speaker 4:  in three days. I don't, they're just gone.

1260
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:22,000
Speaker 4:  And so now I buy, I buy $15 sunglasses like four times a year. It's

1261
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:22,270
Speaker 4:  great.

1262
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:26,180
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I bought prescription sunglasses. I have had them 10 years.

1263
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:29,160
Speaker 6:  The prescription's no longer accurate. Perfect. But I still have the Glasses.

1264
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:32,440
Speaker 6:  Perfect. I probably shouldn't drive with them. It's fine.

1265
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,960
Speaker 5:  I will just say this here. You know, everyone thinks this is a form factor.

1266
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,880
Speaker 5:  Apple thinks this is a form factor. What the most compelling applications

1267
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,750
Speaker 5:  that are being built in the space are all virtual reality applications.

1268
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:46,000
Speaker 5:  Even Apple, right? When you look at their demos, it's like your court side

1269
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,940
Speaker 5:  at the N B A or like there's a dinosaur eating you or whatever. They're all

1270
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:52,690
Speaker 5:  VR applications. There are no compelling

1271
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:55,120
Speaker 5:  mixed reality or AR applications yet because they

1272
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,910
Speaker 6:  Haven't figured out the privacy

1273
01:08:56,910 --> 01:09:00,800
Speaker 5:  Well sure. But they, they just, they can't even demo. Even my demo, my

1274
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,400
Speaker 5:  killer app. I will pay any amount of money for it. Right? Just show me people's

1275
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,600
Speaker 5:  names. I was just at this conference, the amount of time I spent squinting

1276
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,200
Speaker 5:  at people's badges, which is just really a weird thing to

1277
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,280
Speaker 5:  do. By the way, if you're ever hosting a conference, make the names bigger

1278
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,400
Speaker 5:  on the badges. That's my one note. And now that I'm a conference host, well

1279
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,720
Speaker 5:  the font sizes next year are gonna be bananas. It's, it's out of

1280
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,680
Speaker 5:  control. It's huge. Everyone's gonna carry around like yard

1281
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,640
Speaker 5:  signs with their name on them. This is my killer app. This is the thing I

1282
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,600
Speaker 5:  want the most faces and names. It incredibly difficult to do in a

1283
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,040
Speaker 5:  privacy centric way. You might have to build a, a worldwide facial recognition

1284
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:37,960
Speaker 5:  data, but all very hard. Even that, right? That that it's

1285
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,520
Speaker 5:  not built because of those problems. But it's the killer app for ar. No one

1286
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,340
Speaker 5:  can do it. All of the ones are building along the way are vr and that is

1287
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:49,080
Speaker 5:  in conflict with our belief about what the form

1288
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,960
Speaker 5:  factor will be. Because you have to block out the world in to

1289
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,800
Speaker 5:  do VR Well, and a pair of Glasses does, does

1290
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,120
Speaker 5:  not by definition does not do that. And I was having dinner with a

1291
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,480
Speaker 5:  friend at the conference and they're like, oh yeah, but we'll just like do

1292
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:07,100
Speaker 5:  the things on the sides. And I'm like, what kind of like

1293
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:10,760
Speaker 5:  mad Max like bullshit. Are you trying to sell me right

1294
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:11,470
Speaker 5:  now?

1295
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:14,860
Speaker 6:  Good. No, you looked, just looked like you had cataract surgery.

1296
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:17,690
Speaker 5:  No. That you're gonna look like will I am in a like an early two thousands

1297
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:20,590
Speaker 5:  video? God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1298
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:23,060
Speaker 6:  No's a bad look. Don't do that.

1299
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:25,920
Speaker 5:  So like, I'm just saying like all of the best applications that we're building

1300
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,800
Speaker 5:  are VR applications and everyone thinks the form factor will, will

1301
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,520
Speaker 5:  make those applications go away unless you solve this like block out the

1302
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,080
Speaker 5:  world problem. And like, I don't, that's weird. There, there's a tension

1303
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,520
Speaker 5:  there that I think, like you said, David, we're figuring out if there's anything

1304
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:43,820
Speaker 5:  interesting along the way. The thing that's interesting to me along the way

1305
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:47,600
Speaker 5:  is the absolute tension between what's, why you would put

1306
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,100
Speaker 5:  a computer on your face and the form factor of whatever it wants that computer

1307
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:51,620
Speaker 5:  to be

1308
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:54,960
Speaker 4:  Or has to be at the right. We're very much in the like Yeah. You know,

1309
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,880
Speaker 4:  1990s desktop tower PC thing where the only version of it

1310
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,520
Speaker 4:  weighs a thousand pounds and has to live. Yeah. On your wood

1311
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,840
Speaker 4:  office Max setup. Please keep sending us your old desk setups. We love them

1312
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,290
Speaker 4:  so much.

1313
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:09,600
Speaker 5:  We're gonna make a coffee table book. I want to be clear about this. This

1314
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,200
Speaker 5:  is my goal. It's a coffee table book called Computer Rooms and Then. We're

1315
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,320
Speaker 5:  gonna retire and we're gonna buy a boat and that book and that boat will

1316
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,550
Speaker 5:  be called the Computer Room. And I've just been thinking about this

1317
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:22,720
Speaker 5:  plan the whole time.

1318
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,520
Speaker 4:  I love it. Alright, we need to take one more break and Then we're gonna come

1319
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,320
Speaker 4:  back. We're gonna talk about the rider strike real quick and Then, we're

1320
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,280
Speaker 4:  gonna do a little lightning round and Then, we're gonna get outta here. We'll

1321
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:29,400
Speaker 4:  be right

1322
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:36,960
Speaker 4:  back.

1323
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:38,380
Speaker 6:  be reaching a conclusion. Everybody was starting to get kind of excited

1324
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:42,110
Speaker 6:  about whatever contract was coming. Contract is

1325
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:45,690
Speaker 6:  out now. The the Guild still has to vote on it. So both the

1326
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:49,610
Speaker 6:  Writers Guild of America, east and West, both of them still have

1327
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:52,690
Speaker 6:  to vote on it. Everybody's still reading over it. They released a Summary

1328
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:56,410
Speaker 6:  Tuesday night and then they, the next day they release the

1329
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:59,170
Speaker 6:  actual contract. So you can go and if you want to, you can go pour through

1330
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:03,090
Speaker 6:  the whole thing. We, we have like a, a little Summary of it up on the

1331
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:06,730
Speaker 6:  website as well. And there's a lot of big stuff in it. They got almost everything

1332
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:10,690
Speaker 6:  they wanted as far as AI goes. So there's a lot of AI protections in

1333
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:14,680
Speaker 6:  it. You're not gonna be able to go ask AI to

1334
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:18,040
Speaker 6:  come up with a plot and then take that to a writer and make a writer write

1335
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,280
Speaker 6:  it. And then you keep the, the rights to that story. You're not gonna be

1336
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,660
Speaker 6:  able to do that. The, the writer will maintain the rights to the story 'cause

1337
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:28,560
Speaker 6:  AI cannot, AI generated content cannot have rights according to

1338
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,280
Speaker 6:  this contract, which is probably good. I think that was really

1339
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,410
Speaker 6:  exciting. I know I spoke to a few, few writers who were really, really excited

1340
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:39,150
Speaker 6:  about that part of it and excited to just have that protection to,

1341
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:42,280
Speaker 6:  that helps maintain the status quo. And then the thing that's really gonna

1342
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:46,150
Speaker 6:  change the status quo is the

1343
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:49,800
Speaker 6:  data. There's now going to be data that the Writer's Guild is gonna

1344
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,380
Speaker 6:  receive from these streamers like Netflix,

1345
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:56,430
Speaker 6:  Amazon, all these people who have been super, super opaque about their data.

1346
01:14:56,430 --> 01:15:00,320
Speaker 6:  They're not gonna be able to be opaque with the Writer's Guild itself. A

1347
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:04,180
Speaker 6:  lot of that data's not gonna come to the rest of us because it's,

1348
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:07,680
Speaker 6:  you know, they still don't want everybody to know their numbers. But the

1349
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:10,480
Speaker 6:  writer's GU will be able to release it in aggregate and the fact that the

1350
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:14,430
Speaker 6:  numbers are even gonna be out there just changes things. Yeah. Like

1351
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:18,190
Speaker 6:  it's a town. People talk, people are gonna know those numbers.

1352
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:21,260
Speaker 4:  That seems like the bet. Right. I was listening to an interview with Adam

1353
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:25,050
Speaker 4:  Conver, who's a, a writer who's on the negotiating committee for the the

1354
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:28,720
Speaker 4:  Guild. And I forget who, who he was talking to. I wish I could cite the

1355
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,950
Speaker 4:  podcast I was listening to, but he basically was like, if you

1356
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:35,880
Speaker 4:  reporters want the number, maybe you should make a journalist's union and

1357
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,660
Speaker 4:  go fight with studios. I don't care about you. I'm trying to get numbers

1358
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:42,430
Speaker 4:  for my people. But then what he basically said is like, between,

1359
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:45,600
Speaker 4:  between the numbers that are gonna get reported to the Guild and the fact

1360
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,680
Speaker 4:  that this business is shifting towards advertising, like we're just gonna

1361
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:51,800
Speaker 4:  start to know more. It's, they're just, the numbers are going to be reported

1362
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,720
Speaker 4:  to more people. People talk. It's gonna start to be out there in much bigger

1363
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:59,200
Speaker 4:  ways. And I think that's true, but it does seem like, like there there was

1364
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:03,050
Speaker 4:  some rubric they invented for like total

1365
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:06,800
Speaker 4:  hours watched of something. It's like we're we're still inventing the new

1366
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,910
Speaker 4:  numbers of what all of these things mean. Yeah,

1367
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:13,840
Speaker 6:  They're still new numbers, but I think because they're enshrined in

1368
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,520
Speaker 6:  a contract, they'll probably start to stabilize a as the new

1369
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:21,320
Speaker 6:  numbers. Right. We talked about that on the podcast earlier this week and

1370
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:25,100
Speaker 6:  the numbers, they've always been fake. They've always been not real

1371
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:28,080
Speaker 6:  and everybody just agreed, okay, these not real numbers are the ones we're

1372
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,880
Speaker 6:  gonna use. And so now we have new numbers that are probably the most realistic

1373
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,480
Speaker 6:  numbers we've had for, for streaming or, or broadcast

1374
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:38,300
Speaker 6:  television, if I'm being honest. Like these, these are numbers that like

1375
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:41,220
Speaker 6:  are very, very trackable, very understood.

1376
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:45,000
Speaker 6:  And they're different. It's total hours of

1377
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,980
Speaker 6:  something streamed I think is, is it? And that's like kind of goofy,

1378
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:52,880
Speaker 6:  but it's it's a real number. You know it but it does mean that

1379
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,080
Speaker 6:  like if 300 million people watch the first 15 minutes of

1380
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,720
Speaker 6:  something, that could be the same as if one person

1381
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,480
Speaker 6:  watches it 300 billion times. Yes. Which real, very real possibility

1382
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,720
Speaker 6:  because there are some weirdos out there. I'm

1383
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,960
Speaker 4:  One of them like Alex Cramps, Alex

1384
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,320
Speaker 6:  Like me

1385
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,060
Speaker 5:  Speaking of K-Pop fans, I have, I have an important piece of information.

1386
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:15,800
Speaker 5:  Yes. So one of our sponsors at Code was Illuminate, which formerly

1387
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,000
Speaker 5:  Nielsen scan scan, they do the billboard charts. So I was talking to 'em,

1388
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,240
Speaker 5:  hanging out, it was really fun. They did a session and they were talking

1389
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:25,200
Speaker 5:  about how they measure things. Did you know that at the platform level, if

1390
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:29,080
Speaker 5:  you streams something more than 50 times in a day doesn't count

1391
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,260
Speaker 5:  because really there's K-Pop fans. Yeah.

1392
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:32,500
Speaker 4:  You just tap out at 50.

1393
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,960
Speaker 5:  Yep. That's it. If you, if you're more than 50 times a day, they're like,

1394
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,440
Speaker 5:  that's you didn't do it. You, that's not

1395
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,120
Speaker 4:  Becausecause. You're either but do you get the 50?

1396
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,120
Speaker 5:  I don't it, I that's proprietary

1397
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:44,280
Speaker 5:  weirdness. Interesting. Right, but like if you talk to the people who measure

1398
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,200
Speaker 5:  things Luminate, which makes the charts with

1399
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:50,760
Speaker 5:  Billboard. Yeah. They're like, yep. There's, at the platform

1400
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:54,150
Speaker 5:  level we like K-pop fans are like our

1401
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:55,940
Speaker 5:  antagonists.

1402
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:58,600
Speaker 4:  So everything you love you can only stream 49 times

1403
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,390
Speaker 5:  A day. Yeah. And then, and then there's still some like

1404
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:05,160
Speaker 5:  algorithmic renormalization and I think this is now

1405
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:08,360
Speaker 5:  coming, this is my thesis, like all Yeah, whatever happens to the music industry

1406
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:12,070
Speaker 5:  happens to everyone else five years later, this is now gonna come to

1407
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:15,880
Speaker 5:  streaming television because if you're a writer or you

1408
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:19,520
Speaker 5:  have a fandom and there's gonna be an aggregate number that everyone agrees

1409
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,150
Speaker 5:  on, you're, you're necessarily gonna go try to game that number.

1410
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:26,240
Speaker 6:  They, I mean the, the fans already do that. Like if they think there shows

1411
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,920
Speaker 5:  Right. But there's no transparency. Right. Right.

1412
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,240
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah. Right. Right now it was kind of like we're working because it

1413
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:35,020
Speaker 6:  showed up in the Netflix top 10 or we're working because some, some company

1414
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,460
Speaker 6:  did analysis and said,

1415
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:39,550
Speaker 5:  And Void is showing up the Netflix top 10 not guarantee you a goddamn thing,

1416
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:42,150
Speaker 5:  nothing canceled in the middle of the first

1417
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:44,150
Speaker 5:  episode.

1418
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:48,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But not only that, I mean the platforms also have, you know,

1419
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,520
Speaker 4:  a hundred thumbs to put on the scale at any given time. Like the, the, what

1420
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,320
Speaker 4:  Netflix chooses to show you in that big banner when you open the

1421
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,420
Speaker 4:  app is very meaningful.

1422
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:00,880
Speaker 5:  And the top 10 is like very localized. Like the here's the top 10 things

1423
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,400
Speaker 5:  in your house, it's the show that you were the EP of and you're like, oh

1424
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:03,600
Speaker 5:  this is

1425
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,220
Speaker 6:  Right. It's always the shows that they've already canceled. It's like, Alex,

1426
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:10,000
Speaker 6:  do you wanna watch this show? We just canceled. And I'm like, I do and I

1427
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,880
Speaker 6:  hate you. So, so yeah. I like the this the what what this

1428
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,400
Speaker 6:  contract, this contract is straight up historic though also because like,

1429
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,990
Speaker 6:  there were a lot of big price increases in it, particularly around streaming.

1430
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:22,940
Speaker 6:  Streaming is not lucrative if you're a writer just straight up before this,

1431
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:26,760
Speaker 6:  it was not lucrative. You could barely make ends meet for the vast majority

1432
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:30,620
Speaker 6:  of people. And the, the studios have gotten really good about gaming

1433
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:33,780
Speaker 6:  the system that existed to pay as little as possible.

1434
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:37,360
Speaker 6:  And this kind of ended a lot of that gaming. It's still gonna

1435
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,400
Speaker 6:  happen. People are still gonna get screwed outta money that that is the nature

1436
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:44,240
Speaker 6:  of business. But, but this is, this contract

1437
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:48,110
Speaker 6:  really put some really strong guardrails in particularly around streaming.

1438
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:52,080
Speaker 6:  Like they were, they were anticipating, I think it's like a 26%

1439
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,430
Speaker 6:  increase in, in revenue for writers of

1440
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:59,120
Speaker 6:  streaming films that make that have a budget of 30 million or

1441
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,890
Speaker 6:  more. So all those really big Netflix, apple TV films and stuff

1442
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:06,720
Speaker 6:  where previously they probably weren't getting a lot of money for that. They're

1443
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:10,440
Speaker 6:  now gonna be be getting like at least a hundred thousand dollars and that's

1444
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:14,280
Speaker 6:  nice. That, that seems nice to me. So, so yeah,

1445
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,920
Speaker 6:  this was like very historic. SAG is still on

1446
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,480
Speaker 6:  strike, but there's a lot of movement there. People were kind of

1447
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:25,440
Speaker 6:  expecting this to be the way WGA goes. They get this really good

1448
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,880
Speaker 6:  deal SAG is gonna get a lot of similar stuff because of that

1449
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,360
Speaker 6:  deal and be able to close things. And if you were in the Director's Guild

1450
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,960
Speaker 6:  of America, I don't know what to tell you. You guys decided on

1451
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,960
Speaker 6:  your contract before everybody else went on strike. Well

1452
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,710
Speaker 5:  I think they, they might have known that the writers were

1453
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:46,600
Speaker 6:  Yeah, they do. They knew. And, and, and their contract is by

1454
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,520
Speaker 6:  comparison not nearly as good. Ah,

1455
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,550
Speaker 5:  They're directors.

1456
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:54,360
Speaker 6:  Yeah, they're directors. They're fine. They got their producer credit. Like

1457
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,920
Speaker 6:  they can just put themselves in as an actor or a writer. They'll find other

1458
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,000
Speaker 6:  ways to make the money. Oh,

1459
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,830
Speaker 5:  Every director now does a cameo.

1460
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:03,240
Speaker 4:  It's

1461
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,040
Speaker 6:  Gonna be great.

1462
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:07,960
Speaker 5:  I will say the, the Casey on SIA code was like we're doing, we

1463
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:11,760
Speaker 5:  held true detective because we wanted the, we wanted Jodi

1464
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,520
Speaker 5:  Foster to be available to promote the show. We wanted people to be able to

1465
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:17,000
Speaker 5:  talk about it and it's like, oh, the SAG deal isn't done. But they're very

1466
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,870
Speaker 5:  confident that the writers deal is gonna give him the actors deal.

1467
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:21,270
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

1468
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:25,020
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Because so much of the debate is about the same stuff

1469
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:28,380
Speaker 4:  and I think, I think it, it, it definitely seemed to be that it was likely

1470
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:30,920
Speaker 4:  for the Gil to get the deal done first and then there's gonna be a lot of

1471
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:33,960
Speaker 4:  copying and pasting from this deal to that deal. Yeah. Especially it seems

1472
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:37,460
Speaker 4:  with the AI stuff. And I thought one of the most interesting parts of the

1473
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:41,080
Speaker 4:  AI piece of this deal was essentially that they

1474
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,460
Speaker 4:  punted on the question of training data. Like, can you use

1475
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:48,200
Speaker 4:  our work to train AI

1476
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,790
Speaker 4:  models that can make other screenplays

1477
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:53,620
Speaker 6:  That there was a very specific reason for that. And that's because there's

1478
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:57,480
Speaker 6:  so much like law laws that are potentially going to

1479
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:01,160
Speaker 6:  in effect. So why hold onto this bargaining

1480
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:05,040
Speaker 6:  chip when you know that California, this like, I think it was last week,

1481
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,600
Speaker 6:  California said we're gonna look into regulating trading data and, and making

1482
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,280
Speaker 6:  sure compensation happens and stuff.

1483
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:14,120
Speaker 4:  I will bet you $10 right now that this deal gets renegotiated again before

1484
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:17,240
Speaker 4:  anybody makes a law on that. Yeah. Right.

1485
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,940
Speaker 5:  If you know that you're, you're operating in three year cycles, you're like,

1486
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,710
Speaker 5:  eh, will

1487
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:24,000
Speaker 4:  That, that's what I mean. Like I think you're right Alex, but I think, I

1488
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,480
Speaker 4:  think everybody was just like, who the hell knows? Like, let's come back

1489
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,440
Speaker 4:  and do this again in three years. If it gets weird, there's a line in here

1490
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,580
Speaker 4:  that lets us yell at you. If it gets weird, that's good enough for now. Yeah.

1491
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:36,400
Speaker 6:  And I, I thought that was really smart on, on their part. Like, okay,

1492
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,480
Speaker 6:  we're gonna kick this can down the road. Maybe something happens, maybe something

1493
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,350
Speaker 6:  doesn't, we got three years to figure it out.

1494
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:44,090
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's just, it's just a funny acknowledgement of like, no one really

1495
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:48,080
Speaker 4:  knows anything. So like, let's just be cool for now and we'll

1496
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,120
Speaker 4:  figure this out later. I thought that was like, that was just a funny place

1497
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:53,320
Speaker 4:  for that to land. Alright, let's do a lightning

1498
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:57,240
Speaker 4:  round. We are already very long, so let's just blow

1499
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:01,020
Speaker 4:  through this, hit some more news and get out of here. I will go first

1500
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:04,760
Speaker 4:  so you guys can come up with your own Neli. You can quickly read five

1501
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,920
Speaker 4:  Days of The Verge and catch up and see where you are. Oh,

1502
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:10,000
Speaker 5:  I know. I already picked mine. It's very obvious. No, no, that one's mine.

1503
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,580
Speaker 5:  Alex Alex and I are fighting in the Google

1504
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:15,440
Speaker 5:  Doc. There's like two

1505
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,800
Speaker 5:  cursors, like furiously selecting lines in the Google Doc.

1506
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,760
Speaker 4:  There's a lot happening right now. Mine is, there's this big shift

1507
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,720
Speaker 4:  in the podcast world. I feel like we gotta talk about podcasts. On podcasts.

1508
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:29,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Google is killing Google Podcasts because it's all in on YouTube

1509
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:33,160
Speaker 4:  music as the home of podcasts. I just like a random side

1510
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:36,560
Speaker 4:  note is I hate the fact that there are apps called Amazon Music and YouTube

1511
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:40,520
Speaker 4:  Music and they're podcast apps, like bad names everybody like

1512
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,170
Speaker 4:  You, you screwed up. But anyway, Google podcast is going away because Google

1513
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:47,680
Speaker 4:  can't stop killing its apps, but it's all in on YouTube as a

1514
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,600
Speaker 4:  podcast platform. YouTube music has been like a sneaky place

1515
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,640
Speaker 4:  of investment for YouTube for a long time now. And they're getting much louder

1516
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,860
Speaker 4:  about like, we really think this is our subscription business going forward.

1517
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:01,800
Speaker 4:  That's really interesting. Apple Podcasts is going the

1518
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:05,790
Speaker 4:  other way. They're they're integrating a lot of stuff from outside of podcasts

1519
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:09,560
Speaker 4:  into podcasts, including some of the like radio stuff that they've been

1520
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:13,490
Speaker 4:  doing. Some of the different like meditation

1521
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:16,640
Speaker 4:  stuff that they've been doing. There's just a lot of like audio around the

1522
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:20,540
Speaker 4:  Apple ecosystem that's now all being pulled into Apple podcasts.

1523
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:23,840
Speaker 4:  So while, while YouTube goes into YouTube, apple is pulling into

1524
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,240
Speaker 4:  podcasts. And I thought that was very interesting. And also to everyone who

1525
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:31,200
Speaker 4:  has asked what podcast apps should I use? The an there are lots of good

1526
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,560
Speaker 4:  answers minus PocketCasts. It's a terrific app. It's been around

1527
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,400
Speaker 4:  forever. Automatic owns it. The people who own WordPress, so they're not

1528
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,670
Speaker 4:  gonna kill it randomly because they hate you. It's a good app.

1529
01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:43,080
Speaker 4:  PocketCasts,

1530
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,550
Speaker 5:  I can't even mention podcasts without people telling me to use Overcast.

1531
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:47,840
Speaker 5:  They just like show up outta the

1532
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,360
Speaker 4:  Overcast is a great app. The only downside of Overcast is that it is, it's

1533
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:55,280
Speaker 4:  pretty platform specific, but otherwise it is a terrific app. Let's see.

1534
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,300
Speaker 4:  I feel like whichever one of you I call on right now gets to have this one.

1535
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,000
Speaker 4:  No, I I

1536
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,720
Speaker 6:  I I I picked another one. Let

1537
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,120
Speaker 5:  Me go. Lemme go. Stay away. I'm not, I'm not gonna tell you that you stay

1538
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,620
Speaker 5:  outta my chair. Like literally.

1539
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:06,820
Speaker 4:  All right. s Neli, go. Alright.

1540
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:10,160
Speaker 5:  I'm Logitech. It partnered with a company called Play Seat and they've made

1541
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,530
Speaker 5:  it, they've made a Logitech branded Racing

1542
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:16,320
Speaker 5:  chair. I'm really unhappy because I own the same

1543
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:20,160
Speaker 5:  chair without the Logitech improvements. I own the plays seat challenge for

1544
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,480
Speaker 5:  PlayStation VR and Grand Ismo vr. It's a great

1545
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:27,330
Speaker 5:  chair Logitech by the way, if you just look at it. I own their Racing

1546
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:31,140
Speaker 5:  wheel now. They're doing this chair. That company thinks there's a bigger

1547
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:35,000
Speaker 5:  market in Racing Sims and they're just like going

1548
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,920
Speaker 5:  after it. And I think they're right. They know,

1549
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:40,560
Speaker 4:  They know it's coming. This thing folds up. Yeah. Like that's, I have not

1550
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,000
Speaker 4:  bought one of these because No,

1551
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,880
Speaker 5:  No, I have, again, I have the thing, it folds up. It's very good. It does.

1552
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,840
Speaker 5:  Okay. The, yeah, it folds up and the the wheel stays attached and it's all

1553
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,000
Speaker 5:  very compact and you get in a closet. It's just, you unfold it and you put

1554
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,200
Speaker 5:  it in the center of your living room and you're like, I'm gonna use it again

1555
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:56,020
Speaker 5:  tomorrow. You never fall. It's just like,

1556
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:59,640
Speaker 4:  No, my problem is I have to buy this thing without my wife ever finding out

1557
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:03,060
Speaker 4:  that I bought it. So I need it. I need to be able to get rid of it very quickly

1558
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:03,980
Speaker 4:  at a moment's notice.

1559
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,400
Speaker 5:  And there's nothing like furtively hiding a receipt that says the words play

1560
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,910
Speaker 5:  seat on it from your wife.

1561
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:13,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's fun to explain on the, on the credit card statement. Wait, so

1562
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,860
Speaker 4:  what did Logitech do that makes this cool and exciting?

1563
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:18,360
Speaker 5:  So if you just look at some of the, you know, the little lashes a little

1564
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:21,720
Speaker 5:  better, like they've made, they've made some quality of life

1565
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:25,600
Speaker 5:  improvements because they're Logitech. So it's like I, it just, from

1566
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:29,520
Speaker 5:  what I can tell, they've just made it slightly easier to like operate the

1567
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,260
Speaker 5:  folding and the, you know, they, they've just like made it more ergonomic.

1568
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:36,300
Speaker 5:  But I think it's mostly like the things that were red are now blue, you know,

1569
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:39,700
Speaker 5:  but like Logitech is doing this 'cause they want to distribute the stuff,

1570
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,400
Speaker 5:  but Placey doesn't have huge distribution. Right. They're actually a little

1571
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:46,200
Speaker 5:  company logitech's, like Best Buy. So like I, I think they're,

1572
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,640
Speaker 5:  they're taking it and they're putting it out in the channels because they

1573
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,450
Speaker 5:  see a bigger market for this stuff. It

1574
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:53,020
Speaker 6:  Folds down so little

1575
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:56,880
Speaker 5:  Did p ss v r grander Ismo vr. We, we did this whole thing about

1576
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,700
Speaker 5:  The Quest three. Yeah. And I am telling you the grand jury Ismo VR

1577
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:04,600
Speaker 5:  on the pss VR two is one of the single most compelling things you

1578
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:08,400
Speaker 5:  can do in vr. I believe it. Like even and I'm like a car nerd and I

1579
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:12,280
Speaker 5:  love it and it's like fine. Like my friends, my family, I put

1580
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,860
Speaker 5:  them in the thing and like they're in this silly little chair and they go

1581
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:17,860
Speaker 5:  and they're like blown away.

1582
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:21,000
Speaker 6:  You put a little fan in front of 'em, really get the immersion. Yeah.

1583
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,110
Speaker 5:  I stand right next to him going Broom Broom.

1584
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:27,340
Speaker 6:  Just back the truck up. Roll coal on 'em.

1585
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:30,880
Speaker 5:  We did, you know, we did a, we did a like a, you know, kids React video to

1586
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,760
Speaker 5:  Project Star line at code, which is another thing that's impossible to show

1587
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:37,120
Speaker 5:  people, but it's great. We should do it. We should do a video of people reacting

1588
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,720
Speaker 5:  to, to grander mobile vr. 'cause it's super cool.

1589
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,600
Speaker 4:  That's a good idea. I need to stop looking at this page else. I'm gonna buy

1590
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,230
Speaker 4:  this thing. Alex, what's yours?

1591
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:46,660
Speaker 6:  Same. I just wanna close the loop. We know where Amazon for

1592
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:50,540
Speaker 6:  Amazon Hardware Chief David Lemp went. Oh yeah. And he's going to Blue Origin.

1593
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:53,000
Speaker 6:  So he's gonna go build rockets. Just

1594
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,670
Speaker 4:  Can't get enough. G f Bezos. That guy

1595
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:58,040
Speaker 6:  Jeff just can't get enough of Jeff. So that was like we,

1596
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:01,920
Speaker 6:  everybody, conversely they also finally confirmed that Panos per day is

1597
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:05,760
Speaker 6:  definitely coming to Amazon. Yep. That is happening. So all of the stuff

1598
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,680
Speaker 6:  that was up in the air, now we know where everybody is. Yeah. Dave's gonna

1599
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,540
Speaker 6:  be over at Blue Origins, so probably

1600
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:15,360
Speaker 5:  Dave's definitely gonna put Alexa in the rock. Alexa, take me to

1601
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,200
Speaker 5:  space for two minutes. I need to float around a little

1602
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,860
Speaker 5:  bit.

1603
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:23,180
Speaker 6:  And, and Panos is definitely coming to Amazon,

1604
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:26,820
Speaker 6:  so it's both happening. I, I've already emailed

1605
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:30,620
Speaker 6:  Amazon repeatedly about e-readers as soon as it was announced.

1606
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:34,600
Speaker 6:  I'm so sorry to Amazon pr. But yeah, let's see

1607
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,980
Speaker 6:  it. Panos, let's see the, let's see. A really good Kindle.

1608
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:40,920

1609
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:43,680

1610
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:47,600
