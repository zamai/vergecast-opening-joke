Speaker 1:  G R I N. Dot C O.

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,910
Speaker 3:  Hey Ray, stand out from the rush past on Tuesdays this month, we're doing

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,720
Speaker 3:  some extra episodes that are focused on creators or favorite and in

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,650
Speaker 3:  true virtuous fashion, it's the nerdiest creators we can find last

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,040
Speaker 3:  week, Alex, Cranz talked to people, building a mechanical keyboards. Alex

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,390
Speaker 3:  is here. What's up, Alex, Hey,

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:54,990
Speaker 4:  What's up?

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,240
Speaker 3:  What nerds did you find me for this week's episode?

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,840
Speaker 4:  So this week we're going full nerd. I mean, we've already been going full

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,440
Speaker 4:  note, but we're going to be talking track balls, which I think is like niche

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,380
Speaker 4:  of niche. Like there are people who really care about gaming wise, but there

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,590
Speaker 4:  are even fewer of us who care about track balls. And I went and found some

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,460
Speaker 4:  guys and they created their own company to 3d print

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,180
Speaker 4:  track balls. It's called poopy. And they've got like a big vibrant

25
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,330
Speaker 4:  community on Reddit where people are like doing all these crazy mods and

26
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,090
Speaker 4:  stuff. And we're going to talk to them about poopy

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,890
Speaker 3:  Flippy. I'm not

28
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,020
Speaker 4:  Gonna, I'm not gonna spoil it. You're gonna have to listen. That's great.

29
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,270
Speaker 3:  Alright, let's do it. Take it away, Alex.

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,710
Speaker 4:  You know how you maybe have a mouse or game controller and you absolutely

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,640
Speaker 4:  love it. You tore the thing, but sometimes you look at it and you

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,570
Speaker 4:  wonder if the mouse fit your hand better, where the triggers on the back

33
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,290
Speaker 4:  of the controller are longer. There's just a little tweak you want to

34
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,160
Speaker 4:  make with most gadgets that require some heavy duty modding, some

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,280
Speaker 4:  voiding warranties, and a big hunt to find other people trying to do what

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,060
Speaker 4:  you're trying to do. The idea behind <inaudible> a company that makes 3d

37
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,020
Speaker 4:  printed track balls is kind of what if the community and the model was

38
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,590
Speaker 4:  built right in.

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,480
Speaker 4:  I first heard about floopy from a fellow track ball nerd, and it was immediately

40
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,320
Speaker 4:  hooked on the concept. Most track balls nowadays, stick to a handful of tried

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,350
Speaker 4:  and true designs and are made by companies like logic, tech and Kensington.

42
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,980
Speaker 4:  There hasn't been a lot of innovation in this space and it's felt for years,

43
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,010
Speaker 4:  like all the experimentation with form and design stopped in

44
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,060
Speaker 4:  1997,

45
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,060
Speaker 4:  But poopie actively encourages people to come up with their own designs

46
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,930
Speaker 4:  and mods and weird ideas. And they all share them with each other on a pretty

47
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,500
Speaker 4:  active subreddit. I'm going to talk to someone from that subreddit later,

48
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,500
Speaker 4:  but first I want to talk to brothers Colin and Phil lamb.

49
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,550
Speaker 5:  My name's Colin, and I'm on the call with Phil, my partner and my brother.

50
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,540
Speaker 5:  And I'm one of the co-founders of poopy poopy corporation type. My

51
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,330
Speaker 5:  name is film. I'm also one of the co founders of poopy

52
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,560
Speaker 4:  And yes, they can explain why it's called that. So let's get right into our

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,070
Speaker 4:  interview.

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,300
Speaker 5:  So originally my brother and I were just spitballing about

55
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,140
Speaker 5:  what kinds of names we wanted to have for the company for

56
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,800
Speaker 5:  this, the companies that the two of us were running ahead, very serious

57
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,580
Speaker 5:  names and very ridiculous offerings.

58
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,170
Speaker 5:  And we thought, you know, maybe like if we switch it up and we have a silly

59
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,160
Speaker 5:  name, it'll help sharpen our focus and, and give us a

60
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,940
Speaker 5:  little bit of direction. And it just so happened that we were kicking

61
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,930
Speaker 5:  around a couple of names one day and the name came up and we loved it

62
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,730
Speaker 5:  so much that we decided to stick with it.

63
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,850
Speaker 4:  Is this the first track ball you guys had worked on together?

64
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,050
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Phil was actually the one who came up with the idea originally. I

65
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,800
Speaker 5:  think it's like we grew up in the nineties, right. And I accidentally

66
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,340
Speaker 5:  walked into an office Depot when I was like 14 or 15. And I came out of

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,520
Speaker 5:  that store with one of these, with one of the originals, right. Then the

68
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,480
Speaker 5:  Microsoft trackball Explorer. And it turns out there's an entire community

69
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,260
Speaker 5:  of people that just remember this thing very fondly, because honestly, it's,

70
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,170
Speaker 5:  it's a magical piece of equipment. I think when we were talking about something

71
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,080
Speaker 5:  new to do, it was just the project that I had kicking around in my head.

72
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,950
Speaker 5:  I was like, well, I had two of these. I broke both of them. Boy, I wish

73
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,400
Speaker 5:  that I could just have another one. And I bet you, there's lots of people

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,470
Speaker 5:  out there that feel the same way.

75
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,670
Speaker 4:  You are a hundred percent, right. I'm one of those people. I like, I had

76
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,970
Speaker 4:  my track balls when, like, I was really big into the, the lodge tech thumb

77
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,970
Speaker 4:  ball. And when they started like reducing the number of track balls they

78
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,720
Speaker 4:  were making in the late two thousands, I like went out and bought a bunch

79
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,380
Speaker 4:  and had like, I was like, I got a stack up, which is like a very weird thing

80
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,040
Speaker 4:  to do. And when my friend hit me up and was like, Hey, have you heard of

81
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,850
Speaker 4:  poopy? I was immediately like, oh my God, this is the best idea ever,

82
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,270
Speaker 4:  like just lost my mind. I was like, you're, you're going to write a story

83
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,600
Speaker 4:  for us about this. Like I, like, I have to know everything I can about poopy.

84
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,650
Speaker 4:  And so it sounds like was that initial poopy kind

85
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,170
Speaker 4:  of modeled after that, that Microsoft?

86
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,370
Speaker 5:  I think the key idea was there's so many companies that are out there.

87
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,030
Speaker 5:  They make something, especially if it's something that you use everyday,

88
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,820
Speaker 5:  like a keyboard or a mouse or a set of headphones or something like that.

89
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,970
Speaker 5:  And then for whatever reason, these companies stopped supporting it. Maybe

90
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,870
Speaker 5:  it's not profitable anymore. Maybe they can't get the parts anymore, but

91
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,750
Speaker 5:  these are gadgets that people get really attached to and they get really

92
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,060
Speaker 5:  used to them. And then all of a sudden they're gone. They're not available

93
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,020
Speaker 5:  anymore. And it really sucks when that happens. I think

94
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,480
Speaker 5:  everybody has experienced something like that. Something that they really

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,350
Speaker 5:  enjoy and all of a sudden it's gone. And I think one of the key drivers behind

96
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,080
Speaker 5:  what we were doing, especially with open sourcing, everything was, it doesn't

97
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,860
Speaker 5:  matter if we stop making this thing, this thing's always going to be available.

98
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,620
Speaker 5:  This thing is always going, it's always gonna be possible to make this thing,

99
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,040
Speaker 5:  and it's not going to be hugely expensive. It's not going to require

100
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,430
Speaker 5:  $50,000 to make an injection mold or anything like that. It's always gonna

101
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,360
Speaker 5:  be available. I think that was really the key driver behind why we were going

102
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,340
Speaker 5:  with it in that direction to begin with.

103
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,570
Speaker 4:  I think what's really also kind of cool about this is that you have a lot

104
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,500
Speaker 4:  of different types there. Cause track balls were so unique for such a

105
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,020
Speaker 4:  long period of time. There were so many different form factors and

106
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,710
Speaker 4:  as things kind of like drilled down, suddenly we had like the Logitech thumb

107
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,670
Speaker 4:  ball in the Kensington giant ball, and that was kind of it.

108
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,660
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It was funny. The core technology behind all of them

109
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,440
Speaker 5:  is roughly the same. There's some differences in the

110
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,400
Speaker 5:  sensors. Like QMLK huge thing in the keyboard space. It's not

111
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,120
Speaker 5:  a thing in the mouse space or the track ball space or anything like that.

112
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,050
Speaker 5:  And like just a couple of developers from QM, Kay, reached out to us when

113
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,080
Speaker 5:  they figured out what microcontroller we were using and what technology we

114
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,830
Speaker 5:  were using. And that kind of helped make everything more modular,

115
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,370
Speaker 5:  like moving from the classic, which is the original one that we released

116
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,330
Speaker 5:  into the nano, which is only a ball. Like there's no buttons on it at all.

117
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,260
Speaker 5:  It's only a ball moving and porting everything over was really,

118
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,010
Speaker 5:  really straightforward. So it's really easy to create a new form factors

119
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,790
Speaker 5:  and new input types. People were really responding to

120
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,150
Speaker 5:  the sort of philosophy behind, behind the original product. And,

121
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,590
Speaker 5:  and one of the things about running an open source company is that

122
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,920
Speaker 5:  people are really, really eager to give you feedback. And we're also very

123
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,220
Speaker 5:  accessible on Reddit and people are just not afraid to tell you what they

124
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,850
Speaker 5:  think. And you know, just for a while, what we were hearing was this is great,

125
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,690
Speaker 5:  but I wish it was this and this is great, but I wish it was this every

126
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,840
Speaker 5:  once in a while enough people would kind of pile up kind of saying the same

127
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,720
Speaker 5:  thing that we said, all right, well, let's see what happens when we, when

128
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,320
Speaker 5:  we actually do it. Right. And, and that's how we ended up with what we have

129
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,130
Speaker 5:  today, because mostly just people were like, if we want that, we're like,

130
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,600
Speaker 5:  all right, cool. We can make it.

131
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,950
Speaker 4:  So for track balls, it was this one thing you'd always loved. Was there ever

132
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,640
Speaker 4:  the idea that you might do something else besides track balls with poopy?

133
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,600
Speaker 5:  I think so. Yeah. The idea was always to stick with open source. It was always

134
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,660
Speaker 5:  going to be available. There was always going to be options for customization.

135
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,210
Speaker 5:  There was always going to be a community aspect around it, especially, you

136
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,420
Speaker 5:  know, I'm trying to get other people involved, developing new features and

137
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,780
Speaker 5:  just making it accessible. And one of the things that we're working on right

138
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,650
Speaker 5:  now is the headphones projects. And we've just explored like a

139
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,520
Speaker 5:  couple of different ideas in the past. Some not really so successful and

140
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,220
Speaker 5:  some that are really capturing our attention right now. So we always knew

141
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,640
Speaker 5:  we were going to go beyond track balls. I guess we just didn't realize that

142
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,150
Speaker 5:  we would spend, because it's been over two years where we were focused pretty

143
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,120
Speaker 5:  much primarily on track balls and input devices. So

144
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,260
Speaker 4:  I honestly find it fascinating because I think when keyboards really started

145
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,130
Speaker 4:  to develop as this kind of open source project that people were working

146
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,880
Speaker 4:  on, that made sense to me because it's relatively, relatively, I'm not

147
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,150
Speaker 4:  designing my own keyboard anytime soon, simple there's, you know, there's

148
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,960
Speaker 4:  a PCB there's, there's switches. It's, it's all pretty standard. But

149
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,860
Speaker 4:  with, with track balls, you have a lot of additional complexities there.

150
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,340
Speaker 4:  You have to track this ball. You've got these optical sensors. Like

151
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,970
Speaker 4:  that just seems like a lot of extra work for you.

152
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,590
Speaker 5:  The complexity is kind of a blessing and a curse, right? In the sense that

153
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,560
Speaker 5:  it's actually the, one of the most complicated things about the design work

154
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,260
Speaker 5:  is ever making everything fit together. Right? As you say, a keyboard is

155
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,860
Speaker 5:  a linear array of switches, and it's almost, I don't want to say it. I don't

156
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,070
Speaker 5:  want to oversimplify it, but it's, you know, it's a box and you jam some

157
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,790
Speaker 5:  switches inside.

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,960
Speaker 4:  I can build a keyboard very easily. I have my plebeian that have not yet

159
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,350
Speaker 4:  built it.

160
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,360
Speaker 5:  And you know, does designing a mouse, all the components are sort of meant

161
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,570
Speaker 5:  to be used in a context where you have control over them over the mechanisms

162
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,050
Speaker 5:  down to the like kind of microphone level, right? People expect injection

163
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,350
Speaker 5:  molded parts to be very accurate. And so in the context of what we're building,

164
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,190
Speaker 5:  something that anybody can kind of spread out on their desk and put together

165
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,400
Speaker 5:  and we can 3d print or they can 3d print for them because all of our designs

166
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,970
Speaker 5:  are designed in such a way that you should be able to just kind of use a,

167
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,880
Speaker 5:  sort of a bog standard 3d printer to produce this stuff. There's the whole

168
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,180
Speaker 5:  idea behind replicating it. Why would we make it special to our like super

169
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,540
Speaker 5:  cool, amazing secret print form. But that means that there's an extended

170
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,570
Speaker 5:  design process to make sure that all these technologies that are normally

171
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,380
Speaker 5:  designed for a sort of a high precision environment fit into this more

172
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,400
Speaker 5:  kind of loose set of manufacturing technologies. I remember

173
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,420
Speaker 5:  kind of early on in the design process, Phil would send me a bunch of

174
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,020
Speaker 5:  stills cause we have, we're not co located. We're located different spaces

175
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,480
Speaker 5:  and he would send me a bunch of stills and he would say, print these, this

176
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,470
Speaker 5:  is the final version of the classic. It's definitely going to work. And before

177
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,560
Speaker 5:  they would even come off the print bed, he would have new still files for

178
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,310
Speaker 5:  me because the design process just required so much iteration

179
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
Speaker 5:  to get everything precise and get everything right. So it's challenging.

180
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,000
Speaker 5:  It's challenging work for sure. Just to make sure everything fits together.

181
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,140
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well I know some people, a friend were talking to him

182
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,030
Speaker 4:  for, for the podcast even have done a lot of 3d printing with a really the

183
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,520
Speaker 4:  small one. That's just the ball. But, but these other ones that are, have

184
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,120
Speaker 4:  to need a little bit more precision, have you seen a lot of

185
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,810
Speaker 4:  like iteration from poopy users, like

186
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,980
Speaker 4:  making their own 3d designs for these things with four buttons on

187
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,850
Speaker 4:  them and a scroll wheel?

188
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,930
Speaker 5:  Not so much additional buttons, but the one that stands out to me is

189
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,440
Speaker 5:  there was a designer working out of the UK and he came up with a

190
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,980
Speaker 5:  design that used our, all of our trackball designs use roller

191
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,880
Speaker 5:  bearings. They kind of have some drawbacks they're noisy. They

192
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,840
Speaker 5:  can wiggle around. I think that they work great, especially with the balls

193
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,470
Speaker 5:  that we ship, but this designer was not super, super happy with them. So

194
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,160
Speaker 5:  he put in a new kind of bearing called a ball transfer unit, which

195
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,180
Speaker 5:  has no theoretical resistance in any direction they're

196
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,170
Speaker 5:  supposed to roll forever basically. And he basically

197
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,160
Speaker 5:  redid the design for the entire top shell, right from

198
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,000
Speaker 5:  the ground up, including these ball transfer units. And that's probably

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,900
Speaker 5:  the, the biggest amount of rework that I've seen done on it.

200
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,280
Speaker 5:  And it's really very different.

201
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,220
Speaker 4:  Do you think you're going to see more of that? Like more people kind of as,

202
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,580
Speaker 4:  as poopie grows in popularity? Hopefully

203
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,780
Speaker 5:  I hope so as well on the software side, the software side actually is

204
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,650
Speaker 5:  where it really, really took off because for a while there

205
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,400
Speaker 5:  we were the only ones who were involved in, in writing firmware foreign and

206
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,290
Speaker 5:  making sure that it was accessible. And then as soon as the developers from

207
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,190
Speaker 5:  Q and K got involved, it was, it was like watching a monster, transformed

208
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,000
Speaker 5:  a life because I don't think we were involved at all apart from

209
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,810
Speaker 5:  just chipping into, into the code every once in a while or doing,

210
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,590
Speaker 5:  answering a few questions. But that was really amazing to see just how

211
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,560
Speaker 5:  the community took that forward. There's all sorts of weird stuff, right?

212
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,280
Speaker 5:  There's you can, you can scroll with, with a ball and then there was

213
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,210
Speaker 5:  somebody ported it to this there's this thing on QM key called via. Yep.

214
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,660
Speaker 5:  Which allows you to remap buttons without having to reprogram the device.

215
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,110
Speaker 5:  And so somebody went and did that. Now you can remap all the buttons on every

216
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,960
Speaker 5:  plumpy product, I guess the ones that have it, cause the nano it doesn't

217
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,650
Speaker 5:  have any buttons. There's a bunch of other, oh, somebody like did something

218
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,520
Speaker 5:  to the scroll wheel where it made it more <inaudible> to it. Yeah.

219
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,260
Speaker 5:  Because all our scroll wheels they're smooth.

220
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,090
Speaker 4:  And so this gives like the little notches.

221
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,300
Speaker 5:  Yeah, exactly. That one involved the use of a paper clip, a very creative

222
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,660
Speaker 5:  use of a paperclip. I was extremely impressed. That was something. Yeah.

223
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,650
Speaker 5:  The thing we were always hoping for was by making everything as accessible

224
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,520
Speaker 5:  as we possibly could. Then if anyone ever saw a need, they would fix

225
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,240
Speaker 5:  it and they would open source it themselves. I saw someone who

226
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,510
Speaker 5:  wanted to put in, normally the ball that we shipped with is

227
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,680
Speaker 5:  1.7, five inches for the classic. And they wanted to use

228
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,620
Speaker 5:  a track ball, Explorer ball. I don't know why, but they wanted to use one.

229
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,520
Speaker 5:  And it's 1.8, one eight inches. And they redesigned the entire top

230
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,420
Speaker 5:  just to accommodate that ball and open sourced it. And it's available. Like

231
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,690
Speaker 5:  you can, you can print it right now if you want. So really amazing to see

232
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,350
Speaker 4:  That's very, very cool. We talked a little bit about the community. It sounds

233
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,220
Speaker 4:  like poopy. I'm never going to get stopped. Like giggling when I

234
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,930
Speaker 4:  say poopy, I'm so sorry.

235
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,560
Speaker 5:  You know what? It fills my heart with joy. Every time someone laughs at the

236
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,160
Speaker 5:  name, I love it.

237
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,820
Speaker 4:  Where is your community? Is it primarily on Reddit? Is it on discord?

238
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,150
Speaker 5:  It's primarily on Reddit. It's just been a place that's been really welcoming

239
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,320
Speaker 5:  truth. Be told there has been some feedback that has not been helpful, but

240
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,220
Speaker 5:  it's balanced by the unbelievable wealth of knowledge and

241
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,160
Speaker 5:  experience that people bring. And it's definitely pushed everything forward.

242
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,030
Speaker 5:  We'd never would have gotten involved with QM. K if we hadn't been on Reddit

243
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,700
Speaker 5:  and it's just been it's, it's been really incredible

244
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,690
Speaker 4:  Was Reddit and being there and developing that community, always kind of

245
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,380
Speaker 4:  part of the plan.

246
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,080
Speaker 5:  I wouldn't say it was part of the planet kind of happened by accident. And

247
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,830
Speaker 5:  I think Phil was working on the top for the classic. This was

248
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,490
Speaker 5:  maybe two or three months after we decided to team up and he just showed

249
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,910
Speaker 5:  it to me and I thought it looked amazing. And I said, you know what? I'm

250
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,410
Speaker 5:  just going to post this picture on Reddit. I know that there's a track ball,

251
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,440
Speaker 5:  separate. I'm just going to post it there. And there wasn't really any thought

252
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,430
Speaker 5:  or plan behind it. And I did and people were really

253
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,110
Speaker 5:  excited about it and we just kept bringing more news and

254
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,120
Speaker 5:  more developments to Reddit. And the more that that happened, the more excited

255
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,570
Speaker 5:  people got. So yeah, it just kind of happened organically. We do like we

256
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,080
Speaker 5:  do new product design essentially. I don't want to say on Reddit more or

257
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,260
Speaker 5:  less on Reddit, you know, and I think that's, that's something we do that.

258
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,410
Speaker 5:  Not really anyone else. I don't see anyone else doing that. You know, I've

259
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,280
Speaker 5:  got piles of half finished designs, just kind of sitting here and we

260
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,010
Speaker 5:  put them on Reddit. And as Colin said, we get a ton of feedback and it's

261
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,370
Speaker 5:  really helpful because people tell you what they want and they tell you what

262
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,210
Speaker 5:  they do. Not like

263
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,270
Speaker 4:  What's something that they truly do not like.

264
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,870
Speaker 5:  So a lot of the feedback that we're getting more recently is on our

265
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,860
Speaker 5:  headphones. So that's kinda what's top of mind, we frequently post a

266
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,850
Speaker 5:  frequency response. It's as close as you can get to a digitization of how

267
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,910
Speaker 5:  the headphones sound without actually putting them on your head. Right. People

268
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,700
Speaker 5:  are pretty picky about that one. They're like, ah, I don't like, I don't

269
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,950
Speaker 5:  like this part or this part seems not that good and

270
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,980
Speaker 4:  Very strong feelings about frequency, response curves

271
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,250
Speaker 5:  They do. But you know what, it's, it's been helping us focus on the sorts

272
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,250
Speaker 5:  of things to try and push ahead a little bit further. One of the things that

273
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,240
Speaker 5:  sticks out to me from track balls is so some of the things we make, we make

274
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,200
Speaker 5:  a left-handed version. Yes. Not all of them, but some of them, and that

275
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,190
Speaker 5:  vacuum that kind of time before there were left-handed options. People hated

276
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,060
Speaker 5:  that they hated that with a passion, just the sort of like lack

277
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,930
Speaker 5:  of left-handed option was just this thing that people really got stuck

278
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,290
Speaker 5:  on.

279
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,430
Speaker 4:  Do you guys think about these bigger companies and stuff that are still in

280
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,940
Speaker 4:  the track ball space? Like have you heard responses from them? Do you think

281
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,840
Speaker 4:  about like how your products may like make

282
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,980
Speaker 4:  them do things differently?

283
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,090
Speaker 5:  Almost never. We're we're so small compared to

284
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,810
Speaker 5:  the other. I mean, I think we ship in a year, what Logitech ships,

285
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,500
Speaker 5:  every like 25 minutes or something like that. So

286
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,340
Speaker 5:  I think it's less than that. It's like five minutes, maybe 15 minutes. Yeah.

287
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I would be very flattered if Kensington

288
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,300
Speaker 5:  decided that they needed to alter their business strategy because of what

289
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,840
Speaker 5:  we were doing somehow. I don't think there are any executives losing sleep

290
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,850
Speaker 5:  over there because of what we've done.

291
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,540
Speaker 4:  I mean, I think it is interesting that for the most part, the track ball

292
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,930
Speaker 4:  space, hasn't had a lot of movement. It hasn't had a lot of innovation. So

293
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,740
Speaker 4:  like, you guys are kind of pushing this space forward and that

294
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,500
Speaker 4:  respect and that you're saying, Hey, there's still an audience here. There's

295
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,950
Speaker 4:  still people who care about this and make it cooler, make new

296
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,520
Speaker 4:  things.

297
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,540
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think especially with the way that we've positioned everything, you

298
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,530
Speaker 5:  know, trying to make it open source and, and using licenses that are

299
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,100
Speaker 5:  really friendly for open source. It'd be really awkward, I think

300
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,160
Speaker 5:  for, for a more traditional company to come in and, and

301
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,920
Speaker 4:  Start printing your designs,

302
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,620
Speaker 5:  Especially with the way that they're designed and everything. They're not

303
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,280
Speaker 5:  at all designed for traditional manufacturing, if a larger

304
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,940
Speaker 5:  company were to come in and start doing similar things, I think that it would

305
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,930
Speaker 5:  only be beneficial for people who are using track balls. It would mean that

306
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,120
Speaker 5:  there'd be more offerings on the table. And I'm like you said, you know,

307
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,210
Speaker 5:  there's, there hasn't been much innovation going on in the less than a while.

308
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,360
Speaker 5:  So maybe there's still room for, for new developments to be made.

309
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,960
Speaker 4:  No, it was just, it was nice to see like, oh, somebody is actually willing

310
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,860
Speaker 4:  to like, think about this and think about how maybe the way we

311
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,290
Speaker 4:  interact with our computers could be different. Yeah.

312
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,130
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think kind of the real leap towards something really new,

313
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,390
Speaker 5:  it was Phil who originally was, he pitched me the idea for the nano and

314
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,990
Speaker 5:  he said, we have to do this. There's just no alternative. We have to do it.

315
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,080
Speaker 5:  I'll be perfectly, I didn't understand how it could possibly be

316
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,800
Speaker 5:  beneficial because it has no buttons. Right. It's just a ball. It's only

317
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,760
Speaker 5:  a ball. And by far it's our most popular kit they're flying off the

318
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,690
Speaker 5:  shelves. So, but that's a fantastic example of kind of being on

319
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,750
Speaker 5:  Reddit and seeing the community develop. Because I don't want to say that

320
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,170
Speaker 5:  you could just kind of look at a post history in a subreddit and just kind

321
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,690
Speaker 5:  of come away with the conclusion that this was a good idea, because I don't

322
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,560
Speaker 5:  think either of us had that feeling, it was more of a experiment, but it's

323
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,430
Speaker 5:  very much like we're close to the people who, who love our products. And

324
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,790
Speaker 5:  sometimes we can kind of get a sense for what they need before they need

325
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,210
Speaker 5:  it. And I don't want to go full Steve jobs on this and be like, we tell users

326
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,140
Speaker 5:  what they like, but there's very much like there's a

327
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,140
Speaker 5:  lot of value in being deeply connected to the people who love your products.

328
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,330
Speaker 5:  And we're really fortunate to have that.

329
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,610
Speaker 4:  I think what Colin and Phil really impressed on me more than anything else

330
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,750
Speaker 4:  is that the community is driving the company. As much as them after the

331
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,500
Speaker 4:  break, I'm going to talk with Chris person, a very active member of that

332
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,160
Speaker 4:  community who has made a trackball based around a pool cue ball

333
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,090
Speaker 4:  and is currently trying to make a track ball with a steel ball bearing instead

334
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,990
Speaker 4:  of a more traditional plastic ball. He's also the guy who introduced

335
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,570
Speaker 4:  me to <inaudible> to begin with. So stay tuned,

336
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,880
Speaker 1:  Thanks to grin for supporting this episode. So you and your

339
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,800

340
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,220
Speaker 1:  to see if the creator has gotten your product, moving through a tangled web

341
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,030
Speaker 1:  of emails and DMS. And now you're wondering, Hey, did that

342
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,960
Speaker 1:  Instagram post they promised ever even go up influencer marketing

343

344
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,640

352

Speaker 1:  glenn.co that's GRI n.co

353
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,730
Speaker 4:  Hey, we're back. I think I mentioned this before on the verge cast, but the

354
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,330
Speaker 4:  reason I went and bought a poopy is because my friend, Chris person slid

355
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,960
Speaker 4:  into my Twitter DMS to talk about his own build. Naturally I had to beg him

356
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,380
Speaker 4:  to write about poopy for the Virgin and he did. And when he isn't in my

357
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,070
Speaker 4:  DMS, Chris runs the YouTube channel highlight reels, which finds and

358
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,010
Speaker 4:  highlights the weirdest clips for video games.

359
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,280
Speaker 6:  This is highlight reel for May 5th, 2022. And we're going to show you some

360
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,710
Speaker 6:  of the best recent clips from around the gaming world.

361
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,360
Speaker 4:  He felt like the right person to talk to because Chris is super active in

362
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,960
Speaker 4:  the pubic community. He understands the appeal, but he's also just been out

363
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,530
Speaker 4:  there building these things and he's collaborating with other community members

364
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,520
Speaker 4:  and he's 3d printing a whole lot of plastic. Let's talk to

365
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:09,880
Speaker 4:  Chris.

366
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,440
Speaker 4:  I was kind of excited to talk to you about this because the first time I

367
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,340
Speaker 4:  heard about poopy and about building your own track ball

368
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,270
Speaker 4:  was you to sending into my DMS on Twitter and being like, Hey,

369
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:29,170
Speaker 4:  Kranz, look at this cool thing. I found, look what I'm doing right now.

370
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,100
Speaker 4:  Like, do you remember just like assaulting my DMS

371
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,490
Speaker 4:  with it?

372
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,210
Speaker 6:  Okay. You're like one of four people I do that too, to make you feel less

373
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,050
Speaker 6:  special. But, but no, no. I do remember doing that.

374
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,100
Speaker 6:  I think I thought it was funny at first because I was like called gloopy

375
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,450
Speaker 6:  and it's like, Hey, check it out. Poopy. I'm not attract ball person initially.

376
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,570
Speaker 6:  Like I'm not one of those people. Who's just like really deep into using

377
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,810
Speaker 6:  it as my primary interface. But it's fascinating. Cause like in the nineties,

378
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,560
Speaker 6:  like kind of was pretty prevalent in a way that it simply isn't now.

379
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,500
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You know what I mean? Like you, you could see track balls. Like there

380
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,190
Speaker 6:  were normal people attract balls. It wasn't just this thing that like weirdos

381
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,090
Speaker 6:  had all the time

382
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,140
Speaker 4:  And now it's absolutely the weirdest. Like I say, this is a track

383
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,100
Speaker 4:  ball weirdo. Like I have suffered for years because

384
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,310
Speaker 4:  I love track balls. And I'm one of the few people I know that loves them

385
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,000
Speaker 4:  and I will defend them to the death. And you popped into my DMS and was like,

386
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,240
Speaker 4:  Hey, look at this cool track ball. And I was like, oh no, I have a problem.

387
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,210
Speaker 6:  Well, that's the thing is like to give a little background on what poopies

388
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,360
Speaker 6:  deal is. I think you need a little bit of context on keyboards, not too much,

389
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,590
Speaker 6:  but like the deal on like keyboard stuff recently is that

390
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,960
Speaker 6:  like, you know, okay. Yeah. People love mechanical keyboards. They'll have

391
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,620
Speaker 6:  clicky things of SWAT Cylons you'll have yada yada, yada. But like when you

392
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,070
Speaker 6:  get down to it, what really became the thing was that you could

393
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:49,300
Speaker 6:  do open source firmware. So you could just remap your keys. You can

394
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,330
Speaker 6:  do macros, you can do layers, which is really, really interesting. And you

395
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,810
Speaker 6:  can, you just need less keys to do the same thing and with less

396
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,990
Speaker 6:  movement. And so as time has gone on the

397
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,890
Speaker 6:  adaptability of not just one from where like QM K, which is the, the

398
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,910
Speaker 6:  kind of the standard, but like other ones like ZM, K like

399
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,030
Speaker 6:  various ones to like, you know, get it to work and Bluetooth and stuff like

400
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,750
Speaker 6:  that. All these open source things that make it. So you can do all this stuff

401
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,810
Speaker 6:  without installing a bunch of dumb crap on your computer. And so that it

402
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,350
Speaker 6:  can work on them on the processor and like not have to like be tethered to

403
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,430
Speaker 6:  a specific device. Right. And so taking that philosophy and then like going

404
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,820
Speaker 6:  into the like pointing space and being like, okay, but what if you did that

405
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,480
Speaker 6:  for appointing device? Poopy makes like a mouse. They make a thumb

406
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,260
Speaker 6:  ball. They make all these different things. And what got me into the

407
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,770
Speaker 6:  idea that I could just make this first. It was like my friend being like,

408
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,730
Speaker 6:  oh, people make modifications to their plebe. That's that was the first

409
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,440
Speaker 6:  thing they said, oh yeah. He's like, I got a 3d printer. We can just print

410
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,160
Speaker 6:  this and you can change. You can add what's called a BT or ball transfer

411
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,550
Speaker 6:  unit,

412
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,020
Speaker 4:  Little balls that support the big track ball and

413
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,460
Speaker 4:  roll across each other.

414
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,700
Speaker 6:  It's a silly name for something. That's basically like a cylinder with a

415
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,480
Speaker 6:  bunch of ball bearings in it, holding up one ball, bearing making it so it

416
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,020
Speaker 6:  can rotate really smoothly. And then you can put the track ball you have

417
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,750
Speaker 6:  on them. So somebody made a model for that. And I was like, oh, that's pretty

418
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,590
Speaker 6:  cool. My friend 3d printed that out to me, we were getting really into

419
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,250
Speaker 6:  it, you know? Oh, you know, you can strip out the lube and put new

420
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,110
Speaker 6:  lubrication in, you know, all this sort of stuff,

421
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,820
Speaker 4:  Customize the crap out of it.

422
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,360
Speaker 6:  Yay. So basically it's like, I got this, this little track ball. Then you

423
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,320
Speaker 6:  go and call the nano, which is the smallest one. And that was the thing that

424
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,560
Speaker 6:  I think was like, oh, okay, God damn, I gotta get this because it is like

425
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,430
Speaker 6:  $40 Canadian, 45. So it's really cheap for what you're getting, you

426
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:38,000
Speaker 6:  know? And then it fits right into the middle of I'm one of these people with

427
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,510
Speaker 6:  like a split keyboard. So it makes it so that I have this like little tiny

428
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,660
Speaker 6:  pointing device for doing little tiny things. Making sort of have to reach

429
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,380
Speaker 6:  over to my mouse every time. And then from there I got that really liked,

430
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,370
Speaker 6:  it got way more use out of it. Did the modification. And while I was still

431
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,910
Speaker 6:  doing the modification stuff found out about this guy named Jay Fidor,

432
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,260
Speaker 6:  he did this thing where he created his own platform, his own

433
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,190
Speaker 6:  like PCB for something similar and then just prototyped a bunch

434
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,180
Speaker 6:  of them. And at this point I had already gotten into the fact that

435
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,930
Speaker 6:  you can just go to JCL PCB and like all PCB and these like

436
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,280
Speaker 6:  PCB manufacturers

437
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,020
Speaker 4:  And just order a PCB

438
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,990
Speaker 6:  And just order stuff that like people put on GitHub,

439
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,530
Speaker 4:  Like, do you have to solder it yourself when you get it? Or do you just like,

440
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,760
Speaker 4:  it comes you soldered.

441
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,090
Speaker 6:  What you can do is you can upload like the bill of materials and then what's

442
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,480
Speaker 6:  called a component placement file or component placement list rather. And

443
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,600
Speaker 6:  they'll just like, do it for you. It's going to cost you more money. I think

444
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,900
Speaker 6:  I get, do like five of them for 30 bucks and then gave them to a bunch of

445
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,200
Speaker 6:  people I screwed up though, because I didn't recognize, cause I missed a

446
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,070
Speaker 6:  couple of parts and it added a whole extra journey to it. But yeah, no,

447
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,680
Speaker 6:  it's, it's actually pretty easy. As long as you have the files, as long as

448
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,680
Speaker 6:  you kind of know what you're doing, did you get a circuit board printed out

449
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,770
Speaker 6:  as long as it's open source, as long as they have the parts you're you're

450
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,250
Speaker 6:  fine.

451
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I, I don't even know how to like start there cause I'm

452
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,020
Speaker 4:  still, I haven't really sought her. Poopy is going to be my first big

453
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,250
Speaker 4:  project. I got very excited when you, when you sent all of this to me, because

454
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,970
Speaker 4:  while you don't like track balls until this moment, I've always loved them.

455
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,900
Speaker 4:  I was very upset when everybody for a long time kind of Logitech and

456
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,530
Speaker 4:  other kickball makers can sink and kind of shied away from the space

457
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,520
Speaker 4:  and everything they were doing was either really focused on

458
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,690
Speaker 4:  graphic artists and these big professionals and not to people who were just

459
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,200
Speaker 4:  like using it to play video games and fart around on the internet. And they

460
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,320
Speaker 4:  all moved away from that. And I was like, oh no, what am I going to? Like,

461
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,010
Speaker 4:  I, there was one manufacturer it's just logic tech, making a FUM track ball.

462
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,770
Speaker 4:  And I was like, what am I going to do with my life? I went and bought like

463
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,400
Speaker 4:  four of them so that I wouldn't have to worry about them. And now like we're

464
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,340
Speaker 4:  starting to see track balls become a thing again. And poopy is maybe not

465
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,760
Speaker 4:  at the forefront of it because it's, it's, you know, this big open source

466
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,150
Speaker 4:  project, but it's really like providing these cool

467
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,080
Speaker 4:  opportunities and these cool, just like designs that I wouldn't even think

468
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,140
Speaker 4:  of. Like I that's what I, I went and spent so much money on poopy just cause

469
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,690
Speaker 4:  I was like, oh, I've never even thought of using this design. I wonder what

470
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,650
Speaker 4:  this is like, and it's cheap.

471
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,620
Speaker 6:  There's other projects like this that had done it before. Like there's one

472
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,310
Speaker 6:  called the odd ball. That's a 3d printed integrated we track

473
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,460
Speaker 6:  ball. Yeah. Yeah. It's a track ball inside a keyboard. It's a split keyboard.

474
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,940
Speaker 6:  If you look up the oddball keyboard, the person like printed it out, sanded

475
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,510
Speaker 6:  it, cry locks day at primer, all that stuff like that. And then they printed

476
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,140
Speaker 6:  out their own PCB. That's just using like, I think five volt logic or something

477
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,080
Speaker 6:  like that. And it's pretty straight forward. It works with an iterated

478
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,070
Speaker 6:  and see you and stuff like that. But the thing is like, it's a combination

479
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:32,460
Speaker 6:  of two things. One, it's the idea that technology isn't fun. You know what

480
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,460
Speaker 6:  I mean? Like there's a lot of joy that has been taking it out of using the

481
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,330
Speaker 6:  computer, being on the computer sucks a lot of the time. And so what

482
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,750
Speaker 6:  can I do to make this mine? What can I do to

483
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,590
Speaker 6:  really interact with it in a way that hasn't been since like radio

484
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,190
Speaker 6:  shack days do demystify the process between what's between me and the

485
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,090
Speaker 6:  computer even more, but also realization that stuff is really cheap on Allie

486
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,840
Speaker 6:  express. Like if I wanted to, you know, you could disassemble your mouse,

487
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,830
Speaker 6:  dishonor, the mouse clicks and then put new, better

488
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,550
Speaker 6:  micro switches in there. You know what I mean? And that's not an, a difficult

489
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,390
Speaker 6:  thing. I was talking with somebody on a discord server I'm on who made a

490
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,230
Speaker 6:  board called the chunky, which uses two Cirque track pads,

491
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,980
Speaker 6:  which are the track pads that the steam controller uses. And it's like, okay,

492
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,940
Speaker 6:  yeah. Now you can use like dual touch pads on this and like weird

493
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,480
Speaker 6:  rotary coders. It's just like the ways in which you can just get

494
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,990
Speaker 6:  granular with like, you know exactly how you want to

495
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,210
Speaker 6:  use this. And you know, it's, it's, you're still just talking to a computer,

496
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,840
Speaker 6:  but it's also that and like the fact that I never want to install razor

497
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,060
Speaker 6:  sinaps ever again, if I can avoid it.

498
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,990
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think that's like a really interesting part of this because I got

499
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,320
Speaker 4:  a Mac studio. Listeners will know this, we've talked about it a bunch, but

500
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,100
Speaker 4:  I got this Mac studio. I love it. It restarts itself every

501
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,520
Speaker 4:  day for some unknown reason that I'm hoping will sort itself out.

502
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,720
Speaker 4:  And every single time the logic tech software pops up

503
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,170
Speaker 4:  because that's a track ball I use and it's like, Hey, do you want to go change

504
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,990
Speaker 4:  some preferences and logic tech? And I'm like, no, if I didn't do it the

505
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,590
Speaker 4:  last 12 times, it's restarted this week, why would I do it today?

506
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,730
Speaker 4:  And logic tech, razor, they're all like trying to get

507
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,420
Speaker 4:  in front of your eyeballs all the time. So I guess I think, well, let's put

508
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,410
Speaker 4:  really obnoxious software on people's computers and these keyboard

509
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:20,070
Speaker 4:  makers and track ball makers are saying, wait, actually that's bad.

510
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,560
Speaker 4:  Let's stop that. Just use the device.

511
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Speaker 6:  I think the first one, one of them that figures out that there's a market

512
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,000
Speaker 6:  for that. If any of them do yeah. Would be smart. Yes. But

513
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,240
Speaker 6:  I don't necessarily know if they are, it's not within their interest to do

514
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,660
Speaker 6:  that. And it's a really minor community of people who would be like, I really

515
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,320
Speaker 6:  want to edit the text file on this firmware to like

516
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,980
Speaker 6:  able to like change the acceleration curve on how this, or give it an

517
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,010
Speaker 6:  acceleration curve. You know, that's a very minor group of people

518
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,610
Speaker 4:  You say it's minor, but you you've talked a lot about these discord groups

519
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:55,450
Speaker 4:  and these Reddit groups where there's a lot of people doing this

520
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,140
Speaker 4:  and really interested in, you know, the mechanical keyboard Reddit started

521
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,770
Speaker 4:  when I joined it in like 20 12, 20 13 or something. It was a few thousand

522
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,190
Speaker 4:  people and now it's over a million. And I think we all kind of

523
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,090
Speaker 4:  underestimate that market and that interest because there's just not a

524
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,900
Speaker 4:  lot of easily accessible products that feed

525
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,770
Speaker 4:  that. But I do want to kind of poke at you and discord and

526
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,700
Speaker 4:  Reddit. You and I are both on those boards. I am absolutely a lurker. You're

527
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,390
Speaker 4:  much more active in it. How much of Reddit fuels

528
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,190
Speaker 4:  this, this kind of hobby for you?

529
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,120
Speaker 6:  It's a little bit of that. And a little bit of like asking around on discord.

530
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,540
Speaker 6:  I think the discord element is a little cause like I'm in a bunch of them

531
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,750
Speaker 6:  and I think it got everyone in this one, discord I'm in the

532
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,770
Speaker 6:  Absalom, Erica gen one, every Jen's a project that makes it

533
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:45,760
Speaker 6:  so it's easier to quickly prototype keyboard by storing it

534
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,720
Speaker 6:  all as w YAML code. Okay. So it makes it

535
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,900
Speaker 6:  easy to be like, oh, I want to move that column down. And then it just generates

536
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,650
Speaker 6:  the PCB by changing a few easy to read parameters that

537
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,340
Speaker 6:  anybody can do. I just, just kept talking about track balls and now like

538
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,920
Speaker 6:  a lot of them are more trackable people, but one of them is definitely had

539
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,390
Speaker 6:  already had like five poopies.

540
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,940
Speaker 4:  It's just the two of you and like your own little smaller discord.

541
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Speaker 6:  It's a small place. You know what I mean? It's actually pretty small. I think

542
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,330
Speaker 6:  a lot of there's a lot of lurkers the people at post it's. So it's not that

543
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,810
Speaker 6:  many people after I posted the article, like three different people DM me

544
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,630
Speaker 6:  and they're like, okay, can you please, like, do you have any of those? Do

545
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,500
Speaker 6:  you have any of those PCP? Can you send it to me? Is it okay if I get, you

546
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,710
Speaker 6:  know, and I was just like, man, you can just do it yourself. And I know one

547
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,550
Speaker 6:  thing I will say is also like recently raspberry PI put out the, the P the

548
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,180
Speaker 6:  Pico and the <inaudible>, which is a microprocessor, very, very

549
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,170
Speaker 6:  powerful and very cheap, importantly in the keyboard community is

550
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,560
Speaker 6:  like still trying to wrap their head around it. But you're literally seeing

551
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,990
Speaker 6:  like, people who do this in their spare time, like on these discords like

552
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,870
Speaker 6:  talking about, Hey, if anyone does anyone want to mess around with this and

553
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,180
Speaker 6:  then asking problems? Like, there's a big, long conversation today in one

554
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,010
Speaker 6:  of the words I was in about like kales, pseudo monopoly, over

555
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,760
Speaker 6:  low profile switches and how like, well, maybe what, what about Gator on,

556
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,730
Speaker 6:  you know, and stuff like that. And so people are always like tinkering around

557
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:04,030
Speaker 6:  and you actually see it pretty iteratively. You see it a little more like

558
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,600
Speaker 6:  the results on Reddit, but in the comments. And then in discourse, you actually

559
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,510
Speaker 6:  see the process a little bit more. And I think it's really interesting cause

560
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,430
Speaker 6:  it's like, yeah, I feel like you just joined one of these,

561
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,860
Speaker 4:  You know, it's really interesting because if lot the times we think about

562
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,670
Speaker 4:  social media and we think primarily like YouTube or Twitter,

563
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,180
Speaker 4:  or even Twitch as these places that are developing

564
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,290
Speaker 4:  fandoms, developing these communities. And we don't think as much about

565
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:29,710
Speaker 4:  Reddit except for when we were talking about like the Donald, you know, sub,

566
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:33,760
Speaker 4:  but discord too, it sounds like is really becoming this place where people

567
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,660
Speaker 4:  are gathering and talking about these things and communing in a

568
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,730
Speaker 4:  way that we haven't like seen in a while. Is that right?

569
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,350
Speaker 6:  Telegram,

570
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,260
Speaker 4:  Telegram. Yeah.

571
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,350
Speaker 6:  There's a lot of those guys are Russian or Eastern European and they're just

572
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,440
Speaker 6:  like, love talking about that stuff on there. You know what I mean? It's

573
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,770
Speaker 6:  I don't, I'm not a telegram person nor do I intend to be, but yeah.

574
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,970
Speaker 4:  Film poopy through discourt through a friend on discourt

575
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,660
Speaker 4:  or no,

576
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,830
Speaker 6:  I found <inaudible> through looking up track balls, I think

577
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,700
Speaker 6:  on Reddit. And then like, I ended up talking to people on

578
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,790
Speaker 6:  discords and stuff like that. And the, the J fitter stuff was like, one of

579
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,510
Speaker 6:  my friends who helped me 3d print out the thing. And that's the other thing

580
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,080
Speaker 6:  is that 3d printing got way easier. I used to look at 3d printing as this

581
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,990
Speaker 6:  thing that like, cause, cause not only did I do the poopy, I did this other

582
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,470
Speaker 6:  second track ball using the Jeff adore ones to, to button one. It has a full,

583
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,340
Speaker 6:  like I got a black cube ball, like an amaranth one

584
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,610
Speaker 6:  to

585
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,270
Speaker 4:  Darkness.

586
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,480
Speaker 6:  It's enormous. It's a really big track. I usually don't use it that much

587
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,510
Speaker 6:  because it's like, it's too big. And cause I haven't found a way to do a

588
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,960
Speaker 6:  BTU model on it, but you know, three, depending not only got cheaper, you

589
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,770
Speaker 6:  can have and just like do it online. Like the other day, somebody uploaded

590
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,310
Speaker 6:  a bunch of like weird sculpted key caps that they printed out in residence.

591
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:46,820
Speaker 6:  So they look like teeth and they're like, oh yeah, I just got a, a printing

592
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,490
Speaker 6:  service, just print it for me. And I'm like, all right, I'm going to get

593
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,420
Speaker 6:  that printed out in nylon. So I'm getting these key caps that are

594
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,230
Speaker 6:  meant for low-profile keyboards printed out in like, I think what is it like

595
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:01,010
Speaker 6:  an 11 PLF? And I forget what it's called, but it's this like scratchy

596
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,850
Speaker 6:  weird. Sandpapery nylon, that's a process called

597
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,120
Speaker 6:  MGF printing and you can just get this stuff sent to you. Like you don't

598
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,810
Speaker 6:  need to like buy a Prusa or like one of these 3d

599
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,770
Speaker 6:  printers, you either have to have a friend who has it, or you don't mind

600
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,640
Speaker 6:  like going online to, to like a service that'll do it or

601
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,750
Speaker 6:  cut acrylic for you.

602
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,990
Speaker 4:  I'm kind of curious about that because my assumption with 3d printing, a

603
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:27,770
Speaker 4:  lot of the times was there was a certain amount of talent and experience

604
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,400
Speaker 4:  to getting it to do go, right, right. Like you have to print it just so,

605
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,610
Speaker 4:  and then you have to like, make sure you remove it. So it doesn't break.

606
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,360
Speaker 4:  Do you find yourself having to go and reprint things that, that you do through

607
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,080
Speaker 4:  a service

608
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,950
Speaker 6:  In this case? I, this is the first time I've used craft cloud, I think is

609
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,910
Speaker 6:  the name of it. I think all, all three PS, the company that owns them and

610
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,510
Speaker 6:  they're like a front end for like several printing services. So it's like

611
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,200
Speaker 6:  a comparison shopper in the case of the, the ones that I had a friend of

612
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,980
Speaker 6:  mine who printed it out and knew what a good print looks like, did it so

613
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,250
Speaker 6:  that there was that element of it. But in this case you just shop around

614
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:05,210
Speaker 6:  for like, you know, SLA resin printing or whatever, stuff like that. I

615
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,120
Speaker 6:  was pricing out how much it would cost to print something out in titanium.

616
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,720
Speaker 6:  Not as much as you would think. I think a space bar is like 130 bucks, but

617
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,380
Speaker 6:  yeah, I dunno. I guess I guess the, the, the point is what was

618
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,430
Speaker 6:  nice because of the access to the tools is increasingly less

619
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:23,240
Speaker 6:  so. And I think that the saturation for things like 3d printing

620
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:27,200
Speaker 6:  and the saturation for things like laser cutters, those

621
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,710
Speaker 6:  things are getting such that like, it's really, really

622
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,490
Speaker 6:  easy to do. And like other people have already done a lot of the work and

623
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,010
Speaker 6:  that's something I'd like to stress. Like I'm working on a board right now.

624
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,040
Speaker 6:  Like all this stuff is stuff that other people made and that I was just

625
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,100
Speaker 6:  like, oh, I could just get that printed out. What if I did that? But I did

626
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,830
Speaker 6:  it in a different color. And that's the thing is people are just like, they

627
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,140
Speaker 6:  don't want the money. I mean, sometimes they want money for it and obviously

628
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,720
Speaker 6:  pay them if they, if they, you know, if they, but if it's open source and

629
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,540
Speaker 6:  they're like go to town, they're pretty nice about it. Cause this is just

630
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,410
Speaker 6:  their hobby. Yeah.

631
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,310
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well look, the poopy w guys, they just print it out, like in their

632
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,300
Speaker 4:  home or whatever and send it to you. I ordered it. And like I said, these

633
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,720
Speaker 4:  are the colors I want. And one day I just got it all in like just a regular

634
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,710
Speaker 4:  Ziploc bag, nothing fancy, like in a box wrapped in some

635
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,220
Speaker 4:  like Canadian newspaper. And it was great. And I was just like, oh, this

636
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,970
Speaker 4:  is just like some person who really just like digs track balls like I

637
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,920
Speaker 4:  do. And that was a nice feeling.

638
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,560
Speaker 6:  But that's the thing. You see the people who run these shops that you've

639
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,770
Speaker 6:  liked know like in discord, they're like, oh, that's the guy who writes,

640
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,970
Speaker 6:  who runs the MK ultra. It's the name of the low-profile keyboard store. Okay.

641
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,960
Speaker 4:  I mean, that's the way I felt when I saw you drop your truck ball and

642
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,620
Speaker 4:  the sharp Paul subreddit, I was like, oh, Hey, I know that guy. It was nice.

643
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,370
Speaker 4:  This is what I was feeling.

644
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,060
Speaker 6:  It's a series of, Hey, I know that guys. And like, and, and they're really

645
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,820
Speaker 6:  nice. And like, you know, just don't be a Dick.

646
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,010
Speaker 6:  It's pretty straight forward

647
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,450
Speaker 4:  A motto. We should always all live by. Well, thank you, Chris,

648
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,230
Speaker 4:  for chatting with us about poopy and about track balls and 3d

649
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:59,040
Speaker 4:  printing and subreddits and discord. I mean, we just covered everything

650
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,330
Speaker 4:  today. So that was really awesome.

651
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,250
Speaker 6:  It was nice. Thank you. It was nice talking to you.

652
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,410
Speaker 4:  I want to thank Phil and Collin and Chris again for talking to me on the

653
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,950
Speaker 4:  show. And I want to thank you for listening. I think a lot of the time here

654
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,250
Speaker 4:  at the verge and just in the gadget community in general, we get hung up

655
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:21,210
Speaker 4:  on what big companies like apple or logic. I mean, heck even Kensington are

656
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,900
Speaker 4:  doing, these are the companies building the devices we interact with daily,

657
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,620
Speaker 4:  but as big as their market share might be in one category. They don't really

658
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:32,190
Speaker 4:  actually own the whole market. There's a lot of us, including again,

659
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,240
Speaker 4:  most of the verge. And I bet most of the people listening to this

660
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,930
Speaker 4:  podcast right now who want more from a gadget than just the sleek mod

661
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,770
Speaker 4:  free apple experience. I like to build things. And when it comes to gadgets,

662
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,730
Speaker 4:  that's largely left me building a lot of servers, gaming desktops and

663
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,600
Speaker 4:  keyboards. But as Chris noted, 3d printing has started to change things.

664
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,560
Speaker 4:  There's more access to components now than ever before. You can build your

665
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,410
Speaker 4:  own track baller mouse now. And it sounds like you might even be able to

666
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,560
Speaker 4:  build your own headphones too. There are companies like poopy out there,

667
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,590
Speaker 4:  building not the things themselves, but the communities that actually want

668
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,560
Speaker 4:  to build them. I don't know if the poopy subreddit is going to be quite as

669
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,010
Speaker 4:  hopping as the mechanical keyboard separated in eight years, but I don't

670
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,760
Speaker 4:  think this fandom is going to disappear as 3d printing improves as

671
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,060
Speaker 4:  access to other materials improve. I think we're going to see more companies

672
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,790
Speaker 4:  doing what gloopy is doing. The probably without the catchy name.
