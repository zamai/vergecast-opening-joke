00:00:02,675 --> 00:00:06,085
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the Native

3
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:10,485
Speaker 2:  Resonance of Your Smartphone. I'm your friend David Pierce and I am in our

4
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:14,325
Speaker 2:  studio. I mentioned on the show last week that we just got this new studio.

5
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:18,005
Speaker 2:  If you've been watching on YouTube, you've seen it. I'm very jealous. So

6
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,765
Speaker 2:  I got on the Amtrak, came all the way up and now I'm sitting in this like

7
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:24,885
Speaker 2:  chair in the corner that exists for reasons

8
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:29,405
Speaker 2:  as yet to be figured out. Anyway, I'm here because we have

9
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:32,685
Speaker 2:  podcasting to do today on the show we have a couple of really fun things

10
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:36,525
Speaker 2:  to talk about. We're gonna talk to Alex Heath about this like glut of

11
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:40,285
Speaker 2:  headsets that is coming up. We're gonna get stuff from Meta, we're gonna

12
00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:43,285
Speaker 2:  get stuff from Snap. There's been some news about the stuff that we're getting

13
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:46,645
Speaker 2:  from Meta that's pretty interesting. But in general, the VR

14
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:50,845
Speaker 2:  ar headset craze continues and seems to be unstoppable

15
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:54,245
Speaker 2:  and we're gonna talk about it. We also have a story that I've been reporting

16
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:58,245
Speaker 2:  kind of for months now, all based on a YouTube video that

17
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:02,085
Speaker 2:  claims to get the water out of your phone. I have lots of questions and

18
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:05,405
Speaker 2:  we're gonna get answers. All of that is coming up in just a second, along

19
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:09,125
Speaker 2:  with an answer to your questions from The Vergecast hotline. But first,

20
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,685
Speaker 2:  there are lots of microphones in here and I have to go scream into the mall

21
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:15,925
Speaker 2:  and see what trouble I can get into. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right

22
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:16,125
Speaker 2:  back.

23
00:02:46,955 --> 00:02:50,595
Speaker 2:  only a few hundred residents. I have no idea why we went there,

24
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:54,795
Speaker 2:  honestly. I think my mom just found a cool house on Airbnb for pretty

25
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:58,715
Speaker 2:  cheap and was like sick house on the river for the weekend. Out behind

26
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:02,545
Speaker 2:  that Airbnb, there was this little dock that stuck out into the water

27
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:06,665
Speaker 2:  and the day after we got there, my nephew went out onto the dock to fish.

28
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:11,185
Speaker 5:  I was sitting on this little bench they had at the, at the very end of the

29
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:14,825
Speaker 5:  dock and I got lazy So I put my feet up 'cause I was like, okay, I'm gonna

30
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:18,185
Speaker 5:  relax. And then all of a sudden my phone, I feel this slip right out my pocket

31
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:19,665
Speaker 5:  and it falls and right into the water.

32
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:23,865
Speaker 2:  That's Chris, that's my nephew. And his phone is a Samsung Galaxy

33
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:27,625
Speaker 2:  S 24. Basically still brand new. So Chris

34
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:28,625
Speaker 2:  drops his phone.

35
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:33,025
Speaker 5:  I saw a fall like as soon as it went past the dock. I saw it and

36
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:35,665
Speaker 5:  then goes and it starts sinking down,

37
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:39,505
Speaker 5:  just down, down, down and down.

38
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,345
Speaker 2:  Did you think about jumping in

39
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:44,305
Speaker 5:  Immediately? But then I was like, that's a bad idea. I'm gonna go run back

40
00:03:44,305 --> 00:03:45,785
Speaker 5:  and tell him what happened and I hopefully can help me out.

41
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:49,905
Speaker 2:  Chris comes running inside the house where I'm hanging out with a bunch of

42
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:53,545
Speaker 2:  our other family members and tells us what happens. We all immediately jump

43
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:57,225
Speaker 2:  up, go outside, grab all the nets and stuff we can find

44
00:03:57,525 --> 00:04:01,105
Speaker 2:  and start scraping through the muck at the bottom of the river trying to

45
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:04,985
Speaker 2:  find his phone and miracle of miracles. We actually found it.

46
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:09,425
Speaker 2:  Caden, my other nephew, grabbed it in a big net and just pulled it up and

47
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:12,505
Speaker 2:  there it was. It was kind of amazing. At the end of it all the phone had

48
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:16,425
Speaker 2:  probably been underwater for 10, maybe 15 minutes

49
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:20,625
Speaker 2:  and when it came up in that net, the screen was actually on. So it seemed

50
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,145
Speaker 2:  like we might have avoided the worst, but still everyone was worried,

51
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:28,105
Speaker 2:  right? Wet phones are bad no matter what the screen is currently doing. And

52
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:32,025
Speaker 2:  the S 24 did have that warning notification that said water had

53
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:32,665
Speaker 2:  gotten inside.

54
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:36,705
Speaker 5:  We brought it inside. I believe we tried Dr. No, we didn't even try to dry

55
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:40,305
Speaker 5:  it out 'cause someone brought up an idea that he had and we tried it out

56
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:43,065
Speaker 5:  to where literally what he did because it was 'cause it was so little, little

57
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:45,985
Speaker 5:  water, it was still working properly. He opened up a YouTube video and started

58
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,865
Speaker 5:  playing this weird sound that like, like changed like the, I made the speakers

59
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:52,905
Speaker 5:  like do a whole bunch of weird sounds and like ended up I think pushing out

60
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:54,425
Speaker 5:  some of the water or at least losing it up.

61
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:59,385
Speaker 2:  This is where our story really begins. The somebody in question here

62
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:02,705
Speaker 2:  is Gabe, a friend who had come with us for the weekend. So we're all standing

63
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:05,705
Speaker 2:  in the kitchen trying to figure out what to do for Chris's phone and Gabe

64
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:08,985
Speaker 2:  is just like, oh, there's this YouTube video that gets all the water out

65
00:05:08,985 --> 00:05:12,745
Speaker 2:  of your speakers. I have been thinking about that YouTube video ever since.

66
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:16,945
Speaker 2:  And actually it's not just one video but a whole genre of them and

67
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:20,825
Speaker 2:  they are shockingly popular. There's sound to remove water from

68
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:24,785
Speaker 2:  phone speaker, parentheses, all caps guaranteed which has 45 million

69
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:28,505
Speaker 2:  views, 45 million views. Water out of speaker

70
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:32,265
Speaker 2:  sound, iPhone parentheses a hundred percent fix, 3.9 million

71
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:36,265
Speaker 2:  views, 165 hertz test tone, pure sign, wave five

72
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:40,145
Speaker 2:  min remove water from phone. Best version 27 million views

73
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:44,385
Speaker 2:  on and on and on. Hundreds of millions of views on these videos

74
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:48,585
Speaker 2:  from all over the place. And the comments honestly are the best.

75
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:52,505
Speaker 2:  Part. One just says, I think this is the most important video on YouTube.

76
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:55,985
Speaker 2:  No matter how many years go through this vid will just keep getting more

77
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:59,845
Speaker 2:  views. And another one says, damn, we really the elite gang bringing our

78
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:03,605
Speaker 2:  phones in the showers another one at this point, this video is gonna show

79
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:07,565
Speaker 2:  up in my Spotify wrapped. That one actually made me laugh really hard. I'm

80
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:10,365
Speaker 2:  still going to bring my phone in the shower again. So see you guys tomorrow.

81
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,925
Speaker 2:  That's another one. But here's my favorite one and you actually see a lot

82
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:17,805
Speaker 2:  of these on these videos. Everyone saying how they dropped theirs in a

83
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:21,725
Speaker 2:  shower or a pool of water. I dropped mine in cereal edit two months later

84
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:25,405
Speaker 2:  and I'm back here again 'cause I did the same thing again. Edit two, can't

85
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:27,965
Speaker 2:  believe it's been a year since I've gotten some sort of liquid in my phone.

86
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:31,085
Speaker 2:  Well, time to reset the counter 'cause my phone magically landed into my

87
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:31,325
Speaker 2:  pool.

88
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:36,405
Speaker 2:  The point is, there are millions of people out here apparently just

89
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:40,445
Speaker 2:  cavalierly taking their phones into the shower, the pool, the

90
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:44,245
Speaker 2:  rain, whatever and trusting that a YouTube video will

91
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:48,205
Speaker 2:  fix it. Before we get too far, I just wanna play you a clip from one of

92
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:51,125
Speaker 2:  these videos. I'm only gonna play you a few seconds of it because it's not,

93
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:55,405
Speaker 2:  you know, pleasant audio. But just wanna give you the idea of what this

94
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:59,125
Speaker 2:  is doing. So without further ado, here are the lush sounds

95
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:03,125
Speaker 2:  of sound to remove water from phone charging. Port parentheses one hour

96
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:03,445
Speaker 2:  version.

97
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:07,205
Speaker 6:  Woo.

98
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:17,645
Speaker 2:  Like I said, it's not nice to listen to but it's not really supposed to be.

99
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,805
Speaker 2:  It's supposed to do a job and ever since that day trying to fix Chris's

100
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:25,725
Speaker 2:  phone, I've been wondering if it really works because on the one hand

101
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,645
Speaker 2:  lots of people are using these videos and clearly their phones keep working

102
00:07:29,905 --> 00:07:33,765
Speaker 2:  so great. But on the other hand, maybe that's just because our phones

103
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:37,605
Speaker 2:  have gotten impressively waterproof and generally durable over the years.

104
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:41,765
Speaker 2:  So the big question is did we get the water out of Chris's phone or

105
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:45,645
Speaker 2:  did Samsung keep the water from ever getting in? I became obsessed with this

106
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:49,045
Speaker 2:  question I had to know. So the first thing I did was reach out to a bunch

107
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:52,605
Speaker 2:  of phone makers to see what they thought. I didn't get much from Google or

108
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,525
Speaker 2:  Samsung or Apple except for vague responses. Kind of along the lines of

109
00:07:56,655 --> 00:08:00,405
Speaker 2:  seems like it might theoretically work. A few companies did point me to their

110
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:03,685
Speaker 2:  official support pages for liquid damage and what to do if your phone gets

111
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:07,685
Speaker 2:  wet. Apple's for instance says to tap it gently against your hand with the

112
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:11,045
Speaker 2:  lightning or USB port facing down and then leave it in a dry area.

113
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:15,205
Speaker 2:  That's roughly the advice you'll get from most of these companies. That doesn't

114
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:19,005
Speaker 2:  answer my question at all. The most compelling piece of evidence I had for

115
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:21,925
Speaker 2:  my specific question from the very beginning was actually the Apple Watch.

116
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:25,965
Speaker 2:  It has this feature for swimmers where You can turn the digital crown

117
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:29,925
Speaker 2:  to eject water out through the speakers. Some other smart watches like the

118
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:33,605
Speaker 2:  Samsung Galaxy Watch do something similar. This seems like in theory

119
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:38,045
Speaker 2:  the same sort of idea, but Apple presumably has access to all of the

120
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:41,965
Speaker 2:  tech inside the watch to do that stuff. So is it the same thing when

121
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:45,885
Speaker 2:  you just play a video on YouTube? Actually, to be honest, the more

122
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:49,645
Speaker 2:  I got into this and the more I researched and tried to figure out how all

123
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:53,485
Speaker 2:  of this works, the more I realized I don't even understand the basics

124
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:55,925
Speaker 2:  of what's happening here. So I called up this guy,

125
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:59,845
Speaker 7:  I'm Eric Freeman and I'm a senior director of research at Bose.

126
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:04,365
Speaker 2:  In addition to his day job, Eric literally teaches a class to Bose employees

127
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:08,085
Speaker 2:  about how speakers work and So I tried to get him to tell me how speakers

128
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:11,845
Speaker 2:  work, but I'm an idiot. So I made him start at the most basic place

129
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:16,165
Speaker 2:  possible. Like what is a speaker? I know what it's for, I

130
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:19,765
Speaker 2:  know what it does, but if you actually opened up a speaker, what would you

131
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:20,445
Speaker 2:  see inside?

132
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:24,925
Speaker 7:  So I'm gonna start from the back of kind of a conventional speaker,

133
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:28,685
Speaker 7:  which is the most common thing that you'll find. It's in, you know, the speakers

134
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:32,605
Speaker 7:  that are in your Bluetooth speakers or

135
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:36,445
Speaker 7:  your phone or even like pro audio equipment. It's all the same

136
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:40,045
Speaker 7:  technology for the most part it's just tiny versus

137
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:43,805
Speaker 7:  huge versus medium size. So if we start from the back,

138
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:48,165
Speaker 7:  we've got a magnet and the magnet has some steel parts around it and the

139
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:51,885
Speaker 7:  purpose of the steel parts is just to take the magnetic field

140
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:55,845
Speaker 7:  lines and put them in a very specific location. In

141
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,605
Speaker 7:  that specific location there's a coil of wire. So you have a coil of

142
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:03,205
Speaker 7:  wire sitting inside of some magnetic field lines

143
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:07,125
Speaker 7:  and it turns out that when you run electrical current through a wire, it

144
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:11,045
Speaker 7:  behaves like a magnetic, it creates a magnetic field. So just like

145
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:14,765
Speaker 7:  when you play with two magnets, you know You can stick them together or

146
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:18,485
Speaker 7:  have them repel each other. You can run current through a wire

147
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:22,965
Speaker 7:  and have it attract to the permanent magnet or push away from

148
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:23,725
Speaker 7:  the permanent magnet.

149
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:27,925
Speaker 2:  The long and short of it is this, you're using that magnetic field he's talking

150
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:31,885
Speaker 2:  about to essentially push and pull a little piston shaped thing really,

151
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:35,445
Speaker 2:  really, really fast. About 20 times per second all the way to about

152
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:39,205
Speaker 2:  20,000 times per second. The long and short of it is this, you're using

153
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,125
Speaker 2:  that magnetic field he's talking about to essentially push and pull a little

154
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:47,125
Speaker 2:  piston shaped thing really, really fast, somewhere between 20 and

155
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,645
Speaker 2:  20,000 times a second and every time you do it's moving air.

156
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:55,045
Speaker 7:  So 20 is the low frequency. So the base, so like you know, 20

157
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:59,005
Speaker 7:  up to, I don't know 150 or so is generally considered the base range.

158
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:02,525
Speaker 7:  And then as the frequency of vibration gets higher, you get into

159
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:06,805
Speaker 7:  higher tones. So above that is kind of like the vocal

160
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:10,325
Speaker 7:  range and where a lot of instruments sit, it's called the midrange. Like

161
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:13,525
Speaker 7:  a lot of people are probably familiar with the, there's a base control, a

162
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:17,325
Speaker 7:  midrange control and a treble control, right? And as you go higher and

163
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:21,165
Speaker 7:  higher and get into the thousands and tens of thousands of vibrations per

164
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:22,685
Speaker 7:  second, that's the treble

165
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:26,765
Speaker 2:  To change the tone of a sound. You change how fast that little

166
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:30,525
Speaker 2:  piston is moving back and forth and to change the volume, you change how

167
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:34,285
Speaker 2:  much that little piston moves. Thus the bigger the speaker, the more

168
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:37,885
Speaker 2:  space the piston has to move so the more air it pushes around. So the bigger

169
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,765
Speaker 2:  and louder it can be. Hypothetically Eric told me that if you want to get

170
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:45,405
Speaker 2:  your speaker to move as much air as aggressively as possible,

171
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:49,285
Speaker 2:  you'd want to generate really low tones at really high volumes.

172
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:53,645
Speaker 7:  The lowest tone that that speaker can reproduce at the

173
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:57,445
Speaker 7:  loudest level that it can play, that will create the most air motion

174
00:11:57,695 --> 00:12:01,245
Speaker 7:  which will push on the water that's in trapped inside the phone.

175
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:05,725
Speaker 2:  So just super bassy music is just gonna move more air inside of

176
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,685
Speaker 2:  your device than anything else you would think of.

177
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:11,845
Speaker 7:  Yes, that's right. So those YouTube videos, if you listen to them,

178
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:16,125
Speaker 7:  it's not like really deep bass because your phone can't go super deep in

179
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:20,085
Speaker 7:  the bass, but it, it plays kind of in, in the low range of where a phone

180
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:23,925
Speaker 7:  is able to make sound. So it, it uses the range where the,

181
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:26,125
Speaker 7:  the phone can move its speaker the most.

182
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,765
Speaker 2:  So if you have something in your phone, you don't want to be in there, you

183
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:33,685
Speaker 2:  play the lowest tones possible as loud as possible, lots of air moves really

184
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:37,165
Speaker 2:  intensely and boom, you're done. The science kind of tracks.

185
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:40,925
Speaker 2:  When I asked Eric what he thought about my YouTube video question, he only

186
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,925
Speaker 2:  really had one addendum to my theory.

187
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:47,125
Speaker 7:  I think the one caveat is you would wanna hold your phone so that

188
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,605
Speaker 7:  gravity is your friend, right? You would want the speaker to be facing down

189
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:54,725
Speaker 7:  so the water that's trapped near the speaker would

190
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:58,645
Speaker 7:  go as low as possible and probably like puddle against that little

191
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:02,525
Speaker 7:  screen. And then you play that YouTube track with all that base in this and

192
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:06,125
Speaker 7:  the cone starts pumping. I imagine what happens is, you know, with the

193
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:09,965
Speaker 7:  pressure behind the water, it's pushed through the screen and it kind of

194
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,165
Speaker 7:  spits out through the, through the screen, right? And, if you do that long

195
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:16,525
Speaker 7:  enough, the water's gonna jump around and jiggle around and eventually most

196
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:19,405
Speaker 7:  of it's gonna get pushed through the screen and there's probably a little

197
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,005
Speaker 7:  residual amount that just needs to evaporate over time.

198
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:26,285
Speaker 2:  Okay, so I'm almost certain an incredibly stupid question,

199
00:13:26,745 --> 00:13:30,085
Speaker 2:  but would the better idea to be, to put your phone

200
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:34,365
Speaker 2:  right in front of or like inside of some much larger,

201
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:38,405
Speaker 2:  much more powerful speaker? 'cause if, if the goal is to push as much

202
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:42,165
Speaker 2:  air as forcefully as possible, should I do that Or, or at this point am I

203
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:45,765
Speaker 2:  I'm, I'm putting like an aluminum back in the way and it, I'm just gonna

204
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:46,565
Speaker 2:  screw up the whole thing.

205
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:50,445
Speaker 7:  That's a really interesting idea and I think if you, if you were to stick

206
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:54,325
Speaker 7:  your phone into a, a sealed cavity that a big wooer

207
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:57,805
Speaker 7:  was pumping on, right and you develop all this pressure that's gonna push

208
00:13:57,985 --> 00:14:01,405
Speaker 7:  air in and out of that screen for sure, right?

209
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:05,685
Speaker 7:  So I think you could get a setup like that to pump the water

210
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:09,645
Speaker 7:  out. The only danger is that really high pressure could damage the

211
00:14:09,645 --> 00:14:13,445
Speaker 7:  little speaker inside of your phone. So it's much safer to use your

212
00:14:13,465 --> 00:14:16,125
Speaker 7:  own speaker up to the limit of its capability.

213
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:20,685
Speaker 2:  So at this point I'm convinced that at least theoretically You can use a

214
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:24,165
Speaker 2:  YouTube video to get water out of your phone. But I'm still stuck on this

215
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:27,925
Speaker 2:  idea of whether these videos are a placebo or not. All these people

216
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:31,685
Speaker 2:  using their phones in the shower or at the pool or whatever, are they actually

217
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:35,365
Speaker 2:  fixing their phones this way or are they and my nephew Chris, just

218
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:38,725
Speaker 2:  really lucky that phones have gotten impressively waterproof over time.

219
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:42,565
Speaker 2:  The only way to figure this out is just to do some testing and luckily I

220
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:45,725
Speaker 2:  found some folks willing to help. I had first reached out to the team at

221
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:49,405
Speaker 2:  iFixit when I hit up the phone manufacturers basically just to ask, does

222
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:52,965
Speaker 2:  this theoretically make sense to you? I got an email back with a quote from

223
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:56,925
Speaker 2:  I fix it, repairability engineer Karsten Heim. He also made

224
00:14:57,025 --> 00:15:01,005
Speaker 2:  the connection to the Apple Watch and said quote, it's just a specific oscillating

225
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:04,445
Speaker 2:  tone that pushes the water out of the speaker grills. Not sure how effective

226
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,165
Speaker 2:  the third party versions are for phones since they're probably not ideally

227
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:10,685
Speaker 2:  tuned. We could test that is music to my ears my friend.

228
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:14,965
Speaker 2:  So not long after that I got on the phone with Sharam Tari, the lead

229
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:18,405
Speaker 2:  tear down technician at I Fixit and he walked me through a theory he'd been

230
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:22,045
Speaker 2:  developing ever since I sent that first email. Turns out he'd gone down kind

231
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,205
Speaker 2:  of the same rabbit hole I had

232
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:27,245
Speaker 8:  At top of my notes here and I am absolutely shocked would never have occurred

233
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:29,165
Speaker 8:  to me. People are using their phones in the shower.

234
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:32,605
Speaker 2:  Sharam had been wrestling with a question that I hadn't even thought of.

235
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:36,765
Speaker 2:  If You can remove water from a phone using the speakers and if

236
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:40,485
Speaker 2:  Apple already has this feature built into the Apple watch, why

237
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:42,045
Speaker 2:  wouldn't it be built into the iPhone?

238
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:45,405
Speaker 8:  This is definitely not something we should present as fact, but the watches

239
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,725
Speaker 8:  are easier to waterproof and all of Apple's

240
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:52,525
Speaker 8:  terminology they say how they're water resistant and not waterproof, which

241
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:56,325
Speaker 8:  is technically accurate. It's also been designed and has far

242
00:15:56,325 --> 00:16:00,245
Speaker 8:  fewer and limited cavities and holes in the watches than there are on

243
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:04,085
Speaker 8:  the phones, which allows them to design to push the water out

244
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:07,965
Speaker 8:  from those cavities. Whereas on the phone the speakers are located

245
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:12,005
Speaker 8:  at the bottom and the top of the phone, which means you can't get cavities

246
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,525
Speaker 8:  like the sim card slot. It's, it's just not possible to push

247
00:16:15,695 --> 00:16:19,325
Speaker 8:  water out from those cavities. I think that's why they don't

248
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,085
Speaker 8:  include the same feature on the phones because it's just, it's not

249
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:27,205
Speaker 8:  gonna work perfectly as it should or as they would want it to.

250
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:30,285
Speaker 8:  And I, they don't want to mislead people into thinking hey your phone is

251
00:16:30,285 --> 00:16:34,005
Speaker 8:  waterproof again, speculation and we'll do some testing on that to figure

252
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:34,365
Speaker 8:  it out.

253
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:38,565
Speaker 2:  Like basically everyone else I had been talking to Sharam bought the overall

254
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:42,525
Speaker 2:  theory that speakers can move water though he did say it can get

255
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:46,525
Speaker 2:  screwy if the speakers themselves are actually damaged by the water and

256
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:49,045
Speaker 2:  that was just the first of a bunch of new caveats he had.

257
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:53,245
Speaker 8:  Question of whether fresh water and salt water makes a difference

258
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:57,485
Speaker 8:  pops up in my mind, which is something I plan to investigate how long the

259
00:16:57,485 --> 00:17:00,365
Speaker 8:  water's been sitting in your phone is definitely going to make a difference

260
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:04,165
Speaker 8:  because salt, water, mineral and salt deposits are going to

261
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:07,685
Speaker 8:  interfere with the function. Where is it not able to push the

262
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:11,805
Speaker 8:  water out? From which cavities are we going to have the most trouble? What

263
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:15,605
Speaker 8:  does the water damage on the inside look like and does

264
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:19,445
Speaker 8:  this give people a false sense of confidence in

265
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:23,325
Speaker 8:  the water resistance capabilities of both phones and watches?

266
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:27,565
Speaker 2:  That last bit there is one of the things I've been wondering about this whole

267
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:31,285
Speaker 2:  time. It's definitely true that phones are more durable in waterproof than

268
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:34,885
Speaker 2:  ever but it might actually be dangerous to trust that fact too much.

269
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:39,165
Speaker 2:  Your phone might survive a drop in the pool or the toilet or whatever,

270
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:42,965
Speaker 2:  but you still shouldn't drop your phone in the pool or the toilet or whatever

271
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:46,805
Speaker 2:  because lots of other things can go wrong. Phones also wear

272
00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:50,330
Speaker 2:  over time and lose some of that durability and impenetrability.

273
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:54,325
Speaker 2:  So telling people your phone is waterproof so go nuts is actually

274
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:57,645
Speaker 2:  maybe not a good or helpful or even true thing.

275
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:01,845
Speaker 2:  Sharam at the end of our first conversation had a bunch of ideas for other

276
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:05,605
Speaker 2:  tests he wanted to do and he also looped in Chaan Ritter, a master's student

277
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:09,405
Speaker 2:  in electrical engineering who has been working with iFixit. He also

278
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,365
Speaker 2:  had lots of ideas.

279
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:13,125
Speaker 9:  I may be thinking ahead with like a te, I don't know, I just wanna throw

280
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,245
Speaker 9:  it out there. But a test that we could do is we could get a phone, we could

281
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:19,725
Speaker 9:  dunk it in a, have you seen a pressure tank? Like a diving Well we were just

282
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:22,445
Speaker 9:  talking about that we need to get one of those for some of the other ingress

283
00:18:22,445 --> 00:18:25,685
Speaker 9:  test things we had planned. We we could do this for the, the test that you

284
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:29,565
Speaker 9:  could fill it with a UV reactive liquid like put some dye in the water,

285
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:33,685
Speaker 9:  put the phone in there, just dunk it and then take it out, maybe take it

286
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:37,645
Speaker 9:  apart after and then shine a light on it to see where you'd get water

287
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:40,525
Speaker 9:  in there. But that means you'd have to have like two phones and then brand

288
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:41,405
Speaker 9:  new phones you'd have to buy.

289
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:45,765
Speaker 2:  I Fixit has tons of phones lying around but they've all already been

290
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:49,605
Speaker 2:  opened up. That's I fix its thing. They're a company based on repairing

291
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:52,965
Speaker 2:  electronics so they get things to open them up and figure out how to repair

292
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,805
Speaker 2:  them and once you've pried a phone apart you've kind of compromised it.

293
00:18:57,025 --> 00:19:00,085
Speaker 2:  So they just needed new phones to play with if this test was going to really

294
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:04,085
Speaker 2:  feel like the real world. Luckily I had a drawer full of phones

295
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:07,805
Speaker 2:  to play with. I get a lot of phones for various reasons and sometimes the

296
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:11,645
Speaker 2:  companies that ship them to us just don't want them back. Often we will

297
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:15,325
Speaker 2:  donate them or find another use for them but sometimes they just sit around

298
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,925
Speaker 2:  like forever. In this case I have a box full of

299
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:23,085
Speaker 2:  new and old phones that have just been moving around with me for years.

300
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:27,645
Speaker 2:  So I decided to donate a few devices to science and put four phones

301
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:31,405
Speaker 2:  in a box and ship them to I fixit for Sharam and Chaan to take apart.

302
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:35,405
Speaker 2:  The four phones by the way are not particularly representative of anything.

303
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:39,365
Speaker 2:  Just what I had around and available to send it was a Google Pixel seven

304
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:43,205
Speaker 2:  Pro, an iPhone 13, a Google Pixel three and a

305
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:47,045
Speaker 2:  Nokia 7.1 that I think is from 2018. So some old,

306
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:50,365
Speaker 2:  some new, some fancy, some less fancy. Just something to get us started.

307
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:54,405
Speaker 2:  A few weeks later I got an email from Sharam and Chatan saying they had some

308
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:56,885
Speaker 2:  answers for me so we got back on a call, we

309
00:19:56,885 --> 00:20:00,565
Speaker 9:  Got the four phones that you sent us. I tested using a

310
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:05,045
Speaker 9:  UV bath and we made that just by buying some of these.

311
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:09,485
Speaker 9:  So we got, we got like several UV dyes. The original one we started with

312
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:13,365
Speaker 9:  didn't work out so open week. So we got these like boat, like sewage tank

313
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:16,605
Speaker 9:  things to like detect leaks if you're in the harbor and they were amazing.

314
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:19,005
Speaker 9:  It was, I I don't Do you watch Futurama at all?

315
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:20,125
Speaker 2:  A little bit, yeah.

316
00:20:20,315 --> 00:20:22,445
Speaker 9:  Have you seen, do you know the the drink S slm?

317
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:26,685
Speaker 10:  I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in So. I can drink. No

318
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:27,485
Speaker 2:  That's moronic

319
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:30,965
Speaker 10:  Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the S SLM and drink as much as I want.

320
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:36,205
Speaker 9:  Oh, it ended up looking like this and I, I just thought it was hilarious

321
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:38,045
Speaker 9:  but these worked out great

322
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:42,365
Speaker 2:  In case you haven't watched Futurama s SLM and this UV bath are both of these

323
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:46,125
Speaker 2:  kind of toxic spill green looking liquids and in

324
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:49,485
Speaker 2:  ton's case the goal was to submerge a phone in the stuff. Leave it there

325
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:52,485
Speaker 2:  for about a minute and then take it out And. if you look at your phone, You

326
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,485
Speaker 2:  can probably guess where liquid is most likely to get in in that process.

327
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:59,365
Speaker 2:  It's around the power button, the volume keys, the port at the bottom and

328
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:03,045
Speaker 2:  the speakers up top and down below. That's where the phone is open and that's

329
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:06,805
Speaker 2:  where stuff can get in. So the idea was after a minute underwater chattan

330
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:10,285
Speaker 2:  would pick the phone out, gently tap it to get some of the water out, play

331
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:13,725
Speaker 2:  one of our water ejecting YouTube videos and then leave the phone

332
00:21:13,835 --> 00:21:17,365
Speaker 2:  overnight. This is basically what you do if you just dropped your phone in

333
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:21,205
Speaker 2:  a river I think. So it felt like a pretty good test but the S SLM green

334
00:21:21,255 --> 00:21:25,045
Speaker 2:  stuff would leave a trace of wherever it had lingered, which they'd then

335
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:28,885
Speaker 2:  be able to see under a UV light so you'd know where liquid had managed to

336
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:32,245
Speaker 2:  get inside the phone and stay there long enough to leave this residue.

337
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:36,325
Speaker 2:  Anything that came in and then immediately was expelled wouldn't leave much

338
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:40,005
Speaker 2:  trace I should say by the way, that liquid getting inside of your phone isn't

339
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,765
Speaker 2:  by definition the end of the world. There are lots of different ways of

340
00:21:43,765 --> 00:21:47,725
Speaker 2:  waterproofing things and plenty of valid different approaches to keeping

341
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:51,285
Speaker 2:  the really sensitive bits of your device safe. All these companies will tell

342
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:55,085
Speaker 2:  you that the main goal is not to keep water out, it's to keep your phone

343
00:21:55,085 --> 00:21:58,765
Speaker 2:  working no matter what happens. But if You can, you should probably

344
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:02,685
Speaker 2:  try to keep everything out entirely because sure your phone might be

345
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:06,445
Speaker 2:  safe from a few drops of pure fresh water getting inside, but

346
00:22:06,445 --> 00:22:08,725
Speaker 2:  oftentimes that's not what happens in the real world.

347
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:12,605
Speaker 9:  I would assume if you left your phone a little longer in there or you weren't

348
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:15,885
Speaker 9:  as lucky, we wouldn't be in the same situation. Also

349
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:19,765
Speaker 8:  We're talking about taking this thing into the shower repeatedly. So one

350
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:22,285
Speaker 8:  of these days you will take it and then it will fail

351
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:25,805
Speaker 9:  Also you got, I don't know what what other stuff is in shampoo but it's probably

352
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:29,485
Speaker 9:  more conductive than just any liquid like water,

353
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:32,485
Speaker 2:  Right? That's the other part of this is like very rarely are you getting

354
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:35,525
Speaker 2:  what amounts to perfectly fresh water inside of your eye. iPhone at least

355
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:35,725
Speaker 2:  you'll,

356
00:22:35,725 --> 00:22:37,085
Speaker 9:  It'll smell nice after. You know

357
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:41,325
Speaker 2:  One of Apple's official recommendations actually if you get your phone

358
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:45,205
Speaker 2:  submerged in liquid is to immediately rinse it with tap water and

359
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:48,765
Speaker 2:  it includes a picture of just shoving your phone under the kitchen faucet.

360
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:52,645
Speaker 2:  Samsung also suggests soaking your phone in tap water if something like that

361
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:56,525
Speaker 2:  happens. Which seems wild to think about doing but that's

362
00:22:56,645 --> 00:23:00,285
Speaker 2:  actually the point. These modern devices do do a lot to keep liquid out

363
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,365
Speaker 2:  but if something gets in and it's corrosive or otherwise chemically

364
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:08,365
Speaker 2:  in some way, you're in much more trouble. Anyway, Chetan started

365
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:12,245
Speaker 2:  showing me all these pictures of the phones that he'd taken with the UV light

366
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:16,045
Speaker 2:  on. So you're just seeing basically the outline of the phone and these little

367
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:20,045
Speaker 2:  neon green splotches everywhere that there had been liquid. He started with

368
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:20,765
Speaker 2:  the iPhone 13

369
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:24,605
Speaker 9:  So this is the, the inside of the screen and You can clearly see around this

370
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:28,365
Speaker 9:  little hole there's a bunch of residue that was left behind. Now

371
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:32,045
Speaker 9:  on our speakers here, I was surprised that on the bottom speaker at least

372
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:36,285
Speaker 9:  there wasn't as much as I thought there was gonna be and I

373
00:23:36,285 --> 00:23:39,725
Speaker 9:  opened these up, there's a fine mesh in there and that mesh did a really

374
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:43,485
Speaker 9:  good job of preventing anything from going into the

375
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:47,445
Speaker 9:  the speaker C itself. It's either like a really fine mesh, it felt like a

376
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:50,685
Speaker 9:  mesh when I was rubbing a a spider over it or tweezers but it could just

377
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:54,005
Speaker 9:  be textured plastic and it did an excellent job at keeping

378
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,885
Speaker 9:  liquid out. And that was for all of the phones,

379
00:23:57,265 --> 00:24:00,605
Speaker 2:  Huh? 'cause you would think that would be the most natural place for it.

380
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah, to be there. So I guess it makes sense that they would pay special

381
00:24:02,845 --> 00:24:06,685
Speaker 2:  attention to it. Jayden did say he was a little surprised to

382
00:24:06,685 --> 00:24:10,525
Speaker 2:  see the iPhone not keep everything out since the phone's a bit older. Maybe

383
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:13,885
Speaker 2:  the seal degraded or maybe it just wasn't a perfect seal in the first place.

384
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:16,885
Speaker 2:  But like we've been saying, the phone still worked, camera was fine, everything

385
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:20,685
Speaker 2:  was fine so maybe it's fine. Google's Pixel seven Pro was next

386
00:24:21,185 --> 00:24:22,525
Speaker 2:  and kind of crushed it.

387
00:24:22,745 --> 00:24:26,605
Speaker 9:  So this one was interesting because when I opened it up there was no liquid

388
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:30,525
Speaker 9:  inside it at all. It was dry like the, none of the water, like the

389
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:32,645
Speaker 9:  detection stickers were triggered.

390
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:35,125
Speaker 2:  The pixel three though not so good.

391
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:38,845
Speaker 9:  This is the front You can you obviously there's a big green mark here on

392
00:24:38,865 --> 00:24:42,805
Speaker 9:  the, on the speed upper speaker and microphone and then You can see

393
00:24:42,805 --> 00:24:44,165
Speaker 9:  the corners of the display too.

394
00:24:44,505 --> 00:24:48,405
Speaker 2:  So that's like you're gonna see a drop of water underneath your screen basically.

395
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:52,245
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I have the, the device here. It's not very visible

396
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:55,925
Speaker 9:  when I'm holding it now, but if I sort of tilted I can kind of see something

397
00:24:56,345 --> 00:25:00,285
Speaker 9:  and when I turned it on it wasn't as, I mean you could, if you

398
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:03,485
Speaker 9:  really looked at you could detect it but it was sort of hard to see. But

399
00:25:03,845 --> 00:25:06,925
Speaker 9:  regardless there's liquid in your display and that's not a good thing.

400
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:11,245
Speaker 2:  There was lots of residue all around the Pixel three actually in

401
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:14,965
Speaker 2:  the sim card slot and the USBC port and lots of other places you just don't

402
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:18,805
Speaker 2:  want liquid to be. It didn't seem like any of it had gotten so

403
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:22,685
Speaker 2:  deep as to totally destroy the phone except maybe that bit in the

404
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:26,445
Speaker 2:  display but it's not great either way. And the Nokia was even

405
00:25:26,445 --> 00:25:30,365
Speaker 2:  worse. There was residue around the battery and the screen. There was actually

406
00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:34,365
Speaker 2:  corrosion on the USB port and the liquid detection sticker inside

407
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:38,165
Speaker 2:  had triggered, which is usually bad news fair warranty. The other phones

408
00:25:38,165 --> 00:25:41,205
Speaker 2:  though didn't trigger that sticker, even the ones that got a little liquid

409
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:44,165
Speaker 2:  inside. I thought that was really interesting. Again, there are plenty of

410
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:47,485
Speaker 2:  reasons for the differences here. Maybe the phone's just not that sealed

411
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:51,245
Speaker 2:  in the first place or maybe it degraded over time. Maybe it got banged up

412
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:55,125
Speaker 2:  in shipping. I don't know. Jayden and Sharam both kept saying that they wanted

413
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:58,845
Speaker 2:  to do more testing to test a phone the day it comes out and then test another

414
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:02,725
Speaker 2:  model of the same phone six months or a year or two years later to see

415
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:05,685
Speaker 2:  how things change over time. It's a really cool idea and I hope they do it,

416
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:09,245
Speaker 2:  but it requires a lot of phones and it gets really expensive really fast.

417
00:26:09,585 --> 00:26:13,405
Speaker 2:  But for my purposes we're getting somewhere while he was testing the phones,

418
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:17,565
Speaker 2:  Chaan also took these super closeup slow motion videos of each

419
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:21,405
Speaker 2:  phone as he played the YouTube video and You can actually see them working

420
00:26:21,825 --> 00:26:25,285
Speaker 2:  in almost every one of them. The sound starts, the phone starts buzzing and

421
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:28,805
Speaker 2:  immediately you get this burst of water coming out of the speaker grill.

422
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:32,325
Speaker 2:  It's like the tiniest little water fountain you've ever seen. The effect

423
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:36,245
Speaker 2:  slows down pretty fast, but that initial whoosh of air really

424
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:38,685
Speaker 2:  does fire some water out of the speakers.

425
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:46,165
Speaker 2:  The water comes out of both the top speaker and the bottom one, which in

426
00:26:46,165 --> 00:26:49,725
Speaker 2:  Satan's tests were also the two places water was most likely to get in in

427
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:53,565
Speaker 2:  the first place. It's literally like spitting water out as it plays that

428
00:26:53,565 --> 00:26:57,045
Speaker 2:  video, but as Chaan found, it doesn't get everything out.

429
00:26:57,605 --> 00:27:01,245
Speaker 9:  I wonder if like once it got in there because that match does a really

430
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:05,285
Speaker 9:  good job of keeping stuff out if if a little bit did did get in it's,

431
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:07,125
Speaker 9:  you know, it's just gonna keep it in there as well too.

432
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:11,565
Speaker 2:  This is actually a pretty good summation of the situation here. So recent

433
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:15,485
Speaker 2:  phones, especially high end ones, have in fact gotten really good at keeping

434
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:19,245
Speaker 2:  liquid out. Your phone may not be completely waterproof forever in

435
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:23,125
Speaker 2:  all situations, but frankly there's a good chance You can drop it in the

436
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:27,045
Speaker 2:  river and it'll come out working okay, but if liquid does get in, it

437
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,845
Speaker 2:  can be tricky to get back out because it has to go back through that same

438
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:34,405
Speaker 2:  nearly impenetrable seal that it had to go through to get into your phone

439
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:38,405
Speaker 2:  in the first place. But can playing a video on YouTube help?

440
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:43,045
Speaker 2:  I think so at least a little You can shake or tap the phone to get some

441
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:46,485
Speaker 2:  liquid out and see that when it's wet and playing a video like these does

442
00:27:46,485 --> 00:27:50,285
Speaker 2:  seem to generate some more powerful and forceful motion to get

443
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:53,925
Speaker 2:  the droplets moving. There's just no denying the evidence of those drops

444
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:57,725
Speaker 2:  flying out when you play the video and the phone starts vibrating. But it

445
00:27:57,725 --> 00:28:01,445
Speaker 2:  seems like it's only gonna help in spots near the speaker. It's just not

446
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:05,325
Speaker 2:  moving enough air to like push everything around the phone and out

447
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:09,045
Speaker 2:  of the various holes. Those grills at the bottom and top are the easiest

448
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:12,685
Speaker 2:  place for liquid to get in and thus the easiest place to push them out. They

449
00:28:12,685 --> 00:28:16,525
Speaker 2:  also happen to be right next to the speakers and what happens it seems is

450
00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:20,285
Speaker 2:  that after that first bit of liquid is initially ejected out,

451
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:23,965
Speaker 2:  what's left ends up just kind of getting sloshed around as the speaker keeps

452
00:28:23,965 --> 00:28:27,925
Speaker 2:  moving. So yes, a YouTube video might help a little, but

453
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:29,205
Speaker 2:  it won't solve all of your problems.

454
00:28:29,805 --> 00:28:32,885
Speaker 9:  I say they kind of worry I can't hurt like, but I don't see it being an end

455
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:36,925
Speaker 9:  all be all fix or a way to pull all the liquid out.

456
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:40,365
Speaker 2:  There are lots of good tips out there for getting liquid out of your phone,

457
00:28:40,475 --> 00:28:43,845
Speaker 2:  many of which boil down to the same thing. Try to get air moving with your

458
00:28:43,845 --> 00:28:47,645
Speaker 2:  mouth or a fan or canned air but don't do it so aggressively that you might

459
00:28:47,655 --> 00:28:51,605
Speaker 2:  break something inside of the device, put it in rice. Sure, use the silica

460
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:55,565
Speaker 2:  beads fine. There are a million strategies out there and many of them work

461
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:59,405
Speaker 2:  at least a little, but Chetan and Sharam both offered the same advice,

462
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:03,405
Speaker 2:  which is frankly pretty simple and pretty good advice. Don't take your phone

463
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:07,005
Speaker 2:  in the shower, it might survive. You might play the video after you get out

464
00:29:07,105 --> 00:29:11,085
Speaker 2:  and it might be okay, but next time it might not. Every time your phone

465
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:14,845
Speaker 2:  gets wet in any way, you are tempting fate and eventually

466
00:29:15,145 --> 00:29:18,485
Speaker 2:  one time you're gonna do this and the liquid damage Gods are not going to

467
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:22,205
Speaker 2:  care how quickly you manage to get the YouTube app open. But look, I'll just

468
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:25,285
Speaker 2:  level with you after going through this whole process and learning all of

469
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:28,405
Speaker 2:  this about how speakers work, I bookmarked one of these videos and just the

470
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:32,325
Speaker 2:  other day I spilled like two thirds of a can of seltzer right over top of

471
00:29:32,325 --> 00:29:35,885
Speaker 2:  my phone, immediately shook it out, tapped it, played the video,

472
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:40,205
Speaker 2:  and my phone still works. I don't think my phone still works because I played

473
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:43,405
Speaker 2:  that video, but it certainly didn't hurt and it might have helped at least

474
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:47,245
Speaker 2:  a little bit. It's all about getting air moving, you know what I mean? I'm

475
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:49,965
Speaker 2:  sure I'll be back in those comments before too long. Next time I spill some

476
00:29:49,965 --> 00:29:50,325
Speaker 2:  seltzer.

477
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:08,875
Speaker 2:  to be Labor Day and then it happens to be gadget season. That's how it usually

478
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:12,355
Speaker 2:  works. But right now we are in the middle of gadget season.

479
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:16,115
Speaker 2:  Samsung did its thing early, Google did its thing early, we're

480
00:34:16,145 --> 00:34:19,995
Speaker 2:  barreling towards an Apple event. AI stuff is everywhere. It

481
00:34:19,995 --> 00:34:23,955
Speaker 2:  is firmly gadget season and I think what we're actually

482
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:27,475
Speaker 2:  about to start is headset season. There's been some reporting that

483
00:34:27,745 --> 00:34:31,275
Speaker 2:  Meta and Snap and others are about to launch

484
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:35,155
Speaker 2:  headsets and we're getting to a place where we've been doing this

485
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:39,235
Speaker 2:  VR and AR thing long enough that I think we can start

486
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:43,155
Speaker 2:  to ask questions about what we're doing here about how far off this tech

487
00:34:43,155 --> 00:34:46,995
Speaker 2:  really is and about what these companies can do now that

488
00:34:46,995 --> 00:34:50,915
Speaker 2:  works. The verges Alex Heath has been reporting on all of this

489
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:54,555
Speaker 2:  both on the site and in his excellent newsletter command line, which you

490
00:34:54,555 --> 00:34:57,795
Speaker 2:  should absolutely subscribe to So I figured we'd bring him on and just try

491
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:01,595
Speaker 2:  to talk through all of it. Alex, hello. Hi So. I. Wanna talk about

492
00:35:01,595 --> 00:35:04,555
Speaker 2:  Snap and I wanna talk about Meta and I think we should talk about Snap because

493
00:35:04,555 --> 00:35:07,035
Speaker 2:  I think we're only gonna talk a little bit about Snap and then we're gonna

494
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:10,595
Speaker 2:  talk a lot about Meta. But basically you reported both of these companies

495
00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:14,475
Speaker 2:  are going to launch big new headsets kind of within

496
00:35:14,665 --> 00:35:17,995
Speaker 2:  what we think like a couple of weeks of each other in September a week. Okay.

497
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:20,795
Speaker 2:  Within a week of each other. So it's gonna be, it's gonna be a thing. I wanna

498
00:35:20,795 --> 00:35:24,675
Speaker 2:  start with Snap because for years my like

499
00:35:25,305 --> 00:35:28,955
Speaker 2:  Sneakiest hot take about the tech industry was that Snap was way further

500
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,995
Speaker 2:  ahead in all of this AR stuff than people realized and

501
00:35:32,995 --> 00:35:36,875
Speaker 2:  that at some point it was, it was going to just release the thing and nobody

502
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:40,045
Speaker 2:  would've seen it coming. It sounds very much like all these years later we

503
00:35:40,045 --> 00:35:43,845
Speaker 2:  are still not there. This might not be that thing. What are we doing

504
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:47,405
Speaker 2:  here? What is, what is Snap up to with spectacles? Like what is your sense

505
00:35:47,405 --> 00:35:50,925
Speaker 2:  of what's going on inside of Snap as they think about this hardware thing

506
00:35:50,925 --> 00:35:52,005
Speaker 2:  that they've been working on all this time?

507
00:35:52,555 --> 00:35:56,525
Speaker 18:  Yeah, since I've been reporting on this since gosh many

508
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:59,725
Speaker 18:  years, I've felt the same way. Like when is this finally going to arrive?

509
00:36:00,185 --> 00:36:03,965
Speaker 18:  and it keeps getting pushed out. Snap and Meta are

510
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:07,325
Speaker 18:  both showing these air glasses off that they've been working on, but they're

511
00:36:07,325 --> 00:36:10,765
Speaker 18:  essentially glorified prototypes and Snap is

512
00:36:10,765 --> 00:36:14,605
Speaker 18:  repeating its playbook from 2021 where it

513
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:18,725
Speaker 18:  released, I say released in quotes because it showed

514
00:36:19,305 --> 00:36:23,245
Speaker 18:  AR spectacles and when we say that it's, you know, displays

515
00:36:23,465 --> 00:36:27,365
Speaker 18:  inside the lenses where You can see virtual objects on the real world. It

516
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:30,885
Speaker 18:  showed those off and pitched it as kind of a dev kit for its lens creators.

517
00:36:31,385 --> 00:36:34,645
Speaker 18:  And I got to try them. Journalists got to try them but Snap never sold them

518
00:36:34,745 --> 00:36:38,645
Speaker 18:  and they're, they waffled a bit on whether they would sell the version they're

519
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:42,525
Speaker 18:  about to announce in September. The fifth generation, which I'm

520
00:36:42,525 --> 00:36:45,725
Speaker 18:  told is, you know, it's, it's a meaningful upgrade but it's more of a like

521
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:48,605
Speaker 18:  an S type iPhone model. It's more of just a better faster

522
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:52,725
Speaker 18:  version of the design that they released in 2021,

523
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:56,005
Speaker 2:  Which would be something yeah, like the, the one, the one we saw a couple

524
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:59,765
Speaker 2:  of years ago was very cool. I got it in the most incredibly controlled

525
00:36:59,765 --> 00:37:03,165
Speaker 2:  demo. Yeah. and it overheated like every 10 minutes. Same, but when it worked

526
00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:07,205
Speaker 2:  it was, it was cool. Like the, the tech was fairly primitive but pretty good.

527
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:07,965
Speaker 2:  There's

528
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:11,565
Speaker 18:  A lot of good ideas in there. Yeah. Is what I remember and when, you know,

529
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:15,365
Speaker 18:  I kept thinking wow, like when they finally fix the bugs here and the

530
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:19,165
Speaker 18:  battery life and the display quality and the weight, like the

531
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:23,005
Speaker 18:  ideas in the interface and how you use this thing really

532
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:25,965
Speaker 18:  are compelling. It's just really hindered by the tech. And I would say that's

533
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:29,845
Speaker 18:  actually been the story of AR glasses since Snap and Meta

534
00:37:29,845 --> 00:37:33,085
Speaker 18:  both started working are on them around, you know, in earnest around

535
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:36,765
Speaker 18:  2017. Yeah, 20 16, 20 18 is that the tech just

536
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:40,165
Speaker 18:  hasn't been ready for the vision of what these companies think these glasses

537
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:44,245
Speaker 18:  can do. And yes, in the same way that Snap invented a lot of social media

538
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:48,005
Speaker 18:  concepts like stories and ephemeral messaging that we use

539
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:51,925
Speaker 18:  today in META'S apps. They have been very early to eyewear with

540
00:37:51,925 --> 00:37:55,725
Speaker 18:  spectacles and smart glasses and now Meta feels like it's

541
00:37:55,845 --> 00:37:59,005
Speaker 18:  starting to take that narrative away from them. And I think they're hoping

542
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:02,805
Speaker 18:  that especially by going out, you know, a week before Zuckerberg is gonna

543
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:06,525
Speaker 18:  show off his glasses, their prototype will wow people and kind of

544
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:09,925
Speaker 18:  remind everyone that they were actually first and they're still moving ahead

545
00:38:09,925 --> 00:38:13,645
Speaker 18:  here. But again, like they aren't selling these things so they're,

546
00:38:13,645 --> 00:38:15,005
Speaker 18:  they're glorified prototypes.

547
00:38:15,155 --> 00:38:18,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Do you think it even matters, even if Snap comes out and says, you

548
00:38:18,925 --> 00:38:22,325
Speaker 2:  know, we've gone an order of magnitude ahead in technology, these things

549
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:25,925
Speaker 2:  are super cool, really exciting. What was it? You said they're, they're not

550
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:28,925
Speaker 2:  even planning to make 10,000 of them, right? It's like it's, it's a science

551
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:32,885
Speaker 2:  project like it, it is just a science project and I like, I wonder at some

552
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:36,805
Speaker 2:  point why SNAP is gonna continue to release these things.

553
00:38:36,805 --> 00:38:39,885
Speaker 2:  Like what is, what is Spectacles doing for SNAP at this point in time?

554
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:43,925
Speaker 18:  That's a very good question and one that a lot of people inside Snap

555
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:47,325
Speaker 18:  aren't even sure about to be perfectly honest. I mean this is Evan Spiegel

556
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,205
Speaker 18:  and Bobby Murphy, the two co-founders baby this hardware

557
00:38:51,365 --> 00:38:55,125
Speaker 18:  division, they're spending a lot of money still on it and Snap as a business,

558
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:58,565
Speaker 18:  it's just not been doing well. They've really struggled to scale their advertising

559
00:38:58,765 --> 00:39:02,685
Speaker 18:  business and build a sustainable, profitable ads business on top of their,

560
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:06,405
Speaker 18:  you know, messaging app, which I should note is bigger than ever. They have,

561
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:10,725
Speaker 18:  I believe it's over 800 million users globally Snap as a,

562
00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:14,685
Speaker 18:  as a social network is doing well. It's just that it's business is

563
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,965
Speaker 18:  not right. And so investors are looking at their investment in hardware

564
00:39:17,965 --> 00:39:21,925
Speaker 18:  and going, do you really have the leash and the ability

565
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:26,325
Speaker 18:  to compete here in such a capital intensive space where

566
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:30,525
Speaker 18:  Meta is inve investing, you know, billions and billions of dollars

567
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:34,685
Speaker 18:  into AR and Snap is really the, the David

568
00:39:34,785 --> 00:39:38,325
Speaker 18:  to the Goliath here and that's been their story in social media and I think

569
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:42,285
Speaker 18:  Evan Spiegel, the CEO thinks you know that they have a shot even in

570
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:46,205
Speaker 18:  hardware. But I have become very skeptical, especially in the last few years

571
00:39:46,435 --> 00:39:50,285
Speaker 18:  that Snap can be a meaningful player here. I mean my read from just talking

572
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:53,885
Speaker 18:  to company insiders is that they want to have a seat at the table for

573
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:57,645
Speaker 18:  what Spiegel and Zuckerberg both agree could be the next major platform

574
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:01,405
Speaker 18:  shift, which is, you know, us using smart glasses and AR

575
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:05,365
Speaker 18:  glasses to augment, you know, how we use our phones and to eventually shift

576
00:40:05,365 --> 00:40:09,045
Speaker 18:  usage away from phones to to wearables. That has been the narrative that

577
00:40:09,045 --> 00:40:12,965
Speaker 18:  has been spun by both of them, like I said for eight

578
00:40:12,965 --> 00:40:16,925
Speaker 18:  years now. It still feels far away. I think it's getting closer but

579
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:20,565
Speaker 18:  it's still not on the near horizon. And the question is whether Snap has

580
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:24,525
Speaker 18:  the, the leash to survive that long while Meta is investing so

581
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:24,645
Speaker 18:  much,

582
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:29,045
Speaker 2:  It does seem very clear that Snap thought

583
00:40:29,045 --> 00:40:32,325
Speaker 2:  this would all be ready much sooner than it turns out it's actually going

584
00:40:32,325 --> 00:40:34,525
Speaker 2:  to be ready. Everyone did. And that's not just Snap Snap, that's everybody,

585
00:40:34,525 --> 00:40:38,125
Speaker 2:  right? Like that is the whole industry. It's like I think back to when all

586
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:41,085
Speaker 2:  the like Lyfts and Ubers and everybody were telling us that by 2020 everybody

587
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:44,845
Speaker 2:  would taking robot taxis, right? Like yeah it's, it's just the timeline

588
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:46,965
Speaker 2:  of all of this just everybody turned out to be wrong.

589
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:50,405
Speaker 18:  You know, it's, it's funny you said Robotaxis though because I was thinking

590
00:40:50,405 --> 00:40:54,085
Speaker 18:  about that. I was in Phoenix last weekend and I was seeing all the Waymo's

591
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,645
Speaker 18:  on the street there and they're starting to pop up here where I live in

592
00:40:56,705 --> 00:41:00,645
Speaker 18:  LA I see the SF every time I go up there and you know,

593
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:04,605
Speaker 18:  thinking about yeah how long we had to deal with companies

594
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:08,045
Speaker 18:  saying that self-driving was right around the corner and all of a sudden

595
00:41:08,395 --> 00:41:12,325
Speaker 18:  it's kind of here, right? Waymo's doing hundreds of thousands of rides.

596
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:16,445
Speaker 18:  I think AR may be a similar story. I think it's interesting. Yes, they've

597
00:41:16,445 --> 00:41:19,685
Speaker 18:  been saying it for a long time and it's easy to feel like, oh like you know,

598
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:23,485
Speaker 18:  it's just another year of prototypes and vaporware and it, it's

599
00:41:23,505 --> 00:41:27,485
Speaker 18:  no closer. But I do feel like it's getting closer. I think it may be

600
00:41:27,525 --> 00:41:31,405
Speaker 18:  a thing where we really don't see it at meaningful scale meeting millions

601
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,765
Speaker 18:  of units a year until towards the end of this decade. Like

602
00:41:34,765 --> 00:41:38,205
Speaker 18:  20, 28 ish is I think when Meta especially expects it to hit.

603
00:41:38,785 --> 00:41:42,645
Speaker 18:  But I'm expecting these to be good demos, spectacles and

604
00:41:42,705 --> 00:41:46,605
Speaker 18:  META'S classes and it wasn't here for a really long time until

605
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:47,325
Speaker 18:  all of a sudden it was.

606
00:41:47,665 --> 00:41:50,805
Speaker 2:  That's actually a good segue to meta because I think if there is going to

607
00:41:50,805 --> 00:41:54,725
Speaker 2:  be a company in the immediate future that is able to just sort of

608
00:41:54,785 --> 00:41:58,605
Speaker 2:  one day drop it on us, it seems like it's gonna be meta everything we're

609
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:02,405
Speaker 2:  hearing out of Apple is that Apple's ability to make something that is

610
00:42:02,405 --> 00:42:06,365
Speaker 2:  very good and affordable is a long way out. Yeah. Snap. I

611
00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:10,245
Speaker 2:  think we're both sort of slowly giving up on, it feels like if, if there

612
00:42:10,245 --> 00:42:14,165
Speaker 2:  is a company that is going to figure this out in a like all of a sudden it's

613
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:18,085
Speaker 2:  mainstream kind of way, it's probably gonna be meta and my God would I not

614
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:21,245
Speaker 2:  have been on that five years ago? But it feels like, it feels like here we

615
00:42:21,245 --> 00:42:23,885
Speaker 2:  are and especially the, the RayBan glasses have been so successful and it

616
00:42:23,885 --> 00:42:27,725
Speaker 2:  feels like that has shifted Meta's thinking about how to

617
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,925
Speaker 2:  sequence some of this stuff in some ways. Like what's your sense of what

618
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:32,445
Speaker 2:  we're gonna see it connect in a couple of weeks.

619
00:42:32,955 --> 00:42:36,805
Speaker 18:  Yeah, you're right that RayBan has shifted their view a little bit here

620
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:40,725
Speaker 18:  because these last RayBan Smart glasses, which I have, I don't know if you've

621
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,045
Speaker 18:  used them, the version two. Yeah,

622
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:44,125
Speaker 2:  I have a pair. They're awesome. I use 'em all the time. They're

623
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:47,965
Speaker 18:  Quite good. Yeah. And it's the first meta hardware product I see normal

624
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,605
Speaker 18:  people using and talking about and they've been very pleasantly

625
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:55,485
Speaker 18:  surprised with how well it's done and what they're going to show at

626
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:59,165
Speaker 18:  Connect is separate from the RayBan line. I'm expecting updated

627
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:03,085
Speaker 18:  RayBan stuff but nothing meaningful. But really what the big AR

628
00:43:03,085 --> 00:43:06,765
Speaker 18:  glasses thing is this project they've been working on since 2018

629
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:10,685
Speaker 18:  called Orion and they have put billions of dollars into this

630
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:14,525
Speaker 18:  product. I actually don't think it's a stretch to say they have maybe invested

631
00:43:14,585 --> 00:43:18,485
Speaker 18:  snap's entire market cap as a public company into this one pair of

632
00:43:18,485 --> 00:43:22,365
Speaker 18:  glasses. Yeah, yeah. Like trying to invent new metals, new battery technology

633
00:43:22,785 --> 00:43:26,685
Speaker 18:  to try to make a pair of semi lightweight. They're not going to be

634
00:43:26,685 --> 00:43:29,405
Speaker 18:  lightweight, they're about four x the weight of regular glasses, but still

635
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:32,285
Speaker 18:  that's a meaningful upgrade from like the early Magic Leap demos.

636
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:35,405
Speaker 2:  Well and like the Vision Pro or the Quest like it's, it's much closer to

637
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:36,245
Speaker 2:  glasses than those things.

638
00:43:36,595 --> 00:43:40,085
Speaker 18:  Very chunky Clark Kent looking glasses that

639
00:43:40,545 --> 00:43:44,405
Speaker 18:  do holograms lets you virtually, you know, conference with people

640
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:48,165
Speaker 18:  inter integrate with Meta's other apps. So having some 2D elements from

641
00:43:48,165 --> 00:43:51,805
Speaker 18:  other apps brought into there and it's a prototype, it's not something they're

642
00:43:51,805 --> 00:43:55,485
Speaker 18:  going to be selling, they're making even fewer of them than Snap spectacles.

643
00:43:55,795 --> 00:43:59,685
Speaker 18:  They cost a lot of money. I mean both the new spectacles and or the Orion

644
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:03,085
Speaker 18:  glasses cost thousands of dollars to make per unit. So

645
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:07,365
Speaker 18:  this is very like out there tech that, you know, leaders at Meta

646
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:10,645
Speaker 18:  have told me it's prohibitively expensive to do this as a mainstream product.

647
00:44:11,035 --> 00:44:14,765
Speaker 18:  Meta hoped, Zuckerberg hoped that Orion was going to be their first consumer

648
00:44:14,865 --> 00:44:18,365
Speaker 18:  air glasses product. They made the call about two years ago to

649
00:44:18,715 --> 00:44:22,645
Speaker 18:  make it a glorified prototype that they just show to the world. And I

650
00:44:22,645 --> 00:44:25,125
Speaker 18:  think they're doing that because even though they don't have the same business

651
00:44:25,405 --> 00:44:29,285
Speaker 18:  pressure as Snap, they need to justify what they're doing here

652
00:44:29,285 --> 00:44:33,005
Speaker 18:  because this AR program has costs a lot of money and I think everyone looks

653
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:36,885
Speaker 18:  at Quest and goes, oh, like it's all vr. They have a lot of people

654
00:44:36,915 --> 00:44:40,525
Speaker 18:  working on these classes and they're separate from

655
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:44,285
Speaker 18:  RayBan. But I think you'll see the RayBan stuff that they're doing

656
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:47,965
Speaker 18:  and Orion converge in the coming years

657
00:44:48,745 --> 00:44:51,885
Speaker 18:  and they'll approach it from different angles, but they'll have the kinda

658
00:44:51,885 --> 00:44:55,725
Speaker 18:  lower tech, cheaper smart glasses without high-end displays and then the

659
00:44:55,725 --> 00:44:59,685
Speaker 18:  high-end display glasses and then those they hope will emerge towards

660
00:44:59,685 --> 00:45:03,605
Speaker 18:  the end of this decade. But this is a big like moment in terms of just saying

661
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:07,445
Speaker 18:  like, we have something that works even though in a highly controlled

662
00:45:07,475 --> 00:45:11,205
Speaker 18:  demo and we're not selling it, but here it is and here's like a

663
00:45:11,365 --> 00:45:15,245
Speaker 18:  a a marker of where we are in the progression of this technology and

664
00:45:15,385 --> 00:45:19,125
Speaker 18:  I'm expecting Orion to be the most advanced, you know, pair of air glasses

665
00:45:19,275 --> 00:45:22,605
Speaker 18:  that that I will have tried. That doesn't mean it's a good product, right.

666
00:45:22,665 --> 00:45:25,925
Speaker 18:  But it probably will mean it's a good demo and I think that's all meta hopes

667
00:45:25,925 --> 00:45:26,085
Speaker 18:  for

668
00:45:26,635 --> 00:45:29,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah, the context of this moment is really interesting to me because I feel

669
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:33,165
Speaker 2:  like if you rewind what a little over a year now

670
00:45:33,635 --> 00:45:37,565
Speaker 2:  meta like front ran the Vision Pro trying to

671
00:45:37,565 --> 00:45:40,125
Speaker 2:  basically get its thing out there before Apple did because there was this

672
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:43,045
Speaker 2:  perception that Apple was gonna come out and just instantly upend the market

673
00:45:43,345 --> 00:45:46,525
Speaker 2:  and change everything and be the only name anybody cared about in this space.

674
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:50,765
Speaker 2:  That obviously did not happen. Like I think you and I were on the show about

675
00:45:50,765 --> 00:45:54,725
Speaker 2:  a year ago talking about how that might happen and Meta was afraid and everybody

676
00:45:54,725 --> 00:45:57,965
Speaker 2:  was nervous about what Apple would do when it entered this market. I, I think

677
00:45:57,965 --> 00:46:00,525
Speaker 2:  if anything, apple has actually made it harder on everybody else because

678
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:04,565
Speaker 2:  the Vision Pro has not, it hasn't done anything like, I, I dunno

679
00:46:04,565 --> 00:46:07,805
Speaker 2:  that I'd call it a failure. It's just like a nothing, like no one thi no

680
00:46:07,805 --> 00:46:11,285
Speaker 2:  one talks about the Vision Pro, it's just not there. It doesn't exist in

681
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:14,725
Speaker 2:  the world. So, and now Meta has this

682
00:46:15,265 --> 00:46:19,005
Speaker 2:  hit in the RayBan glasses. Mark Zuckerberg has been on like

683
00:46:19,065 --> 00:46:23,005
Speaker 2:  the, the PR 180 of a lifetime. So it

684
00:46:23,005 --> 00:46:26,165
Speaker 2:  feels like the, the context for this company coming into this moment like

685
00:46:26,165 --> 00:46:29,525
Speaker 2:  could not be more different than I think Meta would've expected

686
00:46:30,165 --> 00:46:34,045
Speaker 2:  a year ago. And so to, to some extent, I wonder if this is gonna feel like

687
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:38,445
Speaker 2:  meta just sort of flexing on him much more so than being like, look, we're

688
00:46:38,445 --> 00:46:41,165
Speaker 2:  still in the game. We're trying to be cool. It's just gonna be like Mark

689
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,765
Speaker 2:  with a bunch of gold chains on just being like this cool thing I build.

690
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:47,885
Speaker 18:  I guarantee you there will be some chains, but I, I don't know

691
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:51,845
Speaker 18:  man, I see that but I also just look at what they're announcing and it's

692
00:46:51,845 --> 00:46:55,765
Speaker 18:  not a product. Right. Yeah. So we are still on the like demo phase

693
00:46:55,765 --> 00:46:59,485
Speaker 18:  of AR glasses and I feel like we've been stuck in that since the

694
00:46:59,565 --> 00:47:03,365
Speaker 18:  first magic leap and it doesn't feel like this year will move

695
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:06,965
Speaker 18:  us out of that phase. It feels like we're still stuck there. Yeah. And

696
00:47:07,155 --> 00:47:11,085
Speaker 18:  it's hard to like, you know, I'm expecting to try Orion and the new spectacles

697
00:47:11,085 --> 00:47:14,925
Speaker 18:  and it's hard to feel about how do I write about these because there,

698
00:47:14,995 --> 00:47:18,645
Speaker 18:  it's kind of vaporware in a sense, right? It's not something that someone

699
00:47:18,825 --> 00:47:22,485
Speaker 18:  can buy and take home with them. So what is the point? And

700
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:25,845
Speaker 18:  you know, I think each, you know, company Snap and Meta has slightly different

701
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:28,725
Speaker 18:  reasons for doing it, but I think they both just wanna say, look, we're

702
00:47:28,725 --> 00:47:32,565
Speaker 18:  still in this fight, we're still in this race and we

703
00:47:32,565 --> 00:47:36,445
Speaker 18:  think there is a, you know, pot at the end of the rainbow here. And the,

704
00:47:36,465 --> 00:47:40,365
Speaker 18:  it keeps getting pushed further and further out. But here's what we've got.

705
00:47:40,985 --> 00:47:44,645
Speaker 18:  And you know, I should note like Orion I think will be also

706
00:47:44,645 --> 00:47:48,445
Speaker 18:  different because Meta has invested a lot in this

707
00:47:48,445 --> 00:47:51,845
Speaker 18:  wristband. They're going to have that pairs with it that essentially allows

708
00:47:51,845 --> 00:47:55,605
Speaker 18:  you to control it with your thoughts. It's EMG technology.

709
00:47:55,635 --> 00:47:59,445
Speaker 18:  It's not mind reading, but they bought a startup called Control Labs that

710
00:47:59,445 --> 00:48:03,085
Speaker 18:  we've covered a lot here on The Verge years ago to do this. And they,

711
00:48:03,085 --> 00:48:06,725
Speaker 18:  they've been working on some really novel input technology for

712
00:48:06,995 --> 00:48:10,605
Speaker 18:  wearables that I'm really interested in, even beyond the actual

713
00:48:10,605 --> 00:48:14,445
Speaker 18:  displays. So that's something to watch as well. And then the AI piece, I

714
00:48:14,445 --> 00:48:18,285
Speaker 18:  think Meta has meaningfully accelerated on in the

715
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:22,045
Speaker 18:  last year. I don't know, have you used the, the visual AI in the Ray

716
00:48:22,045 --> 00:48:22,485
Speaker 18:  bands yet?

717
00:48:22,905 --> 00:48:26,605
Speaker 2:  In bits and pieces? Yeah. Yeah. It's really cool. It's, it feels it's, it

718
00:48:26,605 --> 00:48:29,485
Speaker 2:  feels kind of sticky most of the time when I use it, but it is, it is good.

719
00:48:29,665 --> 00:48:32,805
Speaker 18:  It works like half the time for me, right? It still hallucinates, it still

720
00:48:32,805 --> 00:48:36,725
Speaker 18:  makes things up, but it's fast and it's made me realize like, oh,

721
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:40,605
Speaker 18:  like a visual Chad, GPT, like AI

722
00:48:41,145 --> 00:48:45,085
Speaker 18:  in my glasses that understands the world around me is just a killer

723
00:48:45,085 --> 00:48:49,045
Speaker 18:  feature and when it works at scale will make me use my

724
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:52,845
Speaker 18:  phone less and I don't even need displays for that. And I think Meta's

725
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:56,165
Speaker 18:  seen that in the last six months even with how kind of rudimentary it is

726
00:48:56,165 --> 00:48:59,685
Speaker 18:  now and said, wow, like we need to lean into this. And they have I think,

727
00:48:59,685 --> 00:49:03,445
Speaker 18:  just better tech in this regard than Snap. And

728
00:49:03,685 --> 00:49:07,645
Speaker 18:  I think for wearable glasses to take off, really we've, we've seen

729
00:49:07,705 --> 00:49:11,005
Speaker 18:  now in the last year that you need that AI piece And I think that's something

730
00:49:11,005 --> 00:49:14,925
Speaker 18:  meta will also keep leaning into very heavily at Connect. And

731
00:49:15,405 --> 00:49:15,845
Speaker 18:  after that

732
00:49:16,265 --> 00:49:20,205
Speaker 2:  It makes sense. So, I, I understand I think most of the motivation

733
00:49:20,225 --> 00:49:23,645
Speaker 2:  for why Snap needs to talk about this stuff and kind of remind people that

734
00:49:23,645 --> 00:49:27,325
Speaker 2:  it's in the game and still matters and get people to build for its

735
00:49:27,485 --> 00:49:31,325
Speaker 2:  platform. And like I, like I, I get that from Snap Side for Meta.

736
00:49:31,765 --> 00:49:35,445
Speaker 2:  I don't know that I get it quite as much because Meta is is doing very well

737
00:49:35,465 --> 00:49:38,965
Speaker 2:  in ai, which are, if you're an investors, the only thing anybody cares about,

738
00:49:39,025 --> 00:49:42,485
Speaker 2:  if anything, everybody views all this other stuff as a diversion. So to keep

739
00:49:42,485 --> 00:49:46,245
Speaker 2:  doing this stuff basically out of the public view of Wall Street

740
00:49:46,655 --> 00:49:50,485
Speaker 2:  seems like it sort of makes sense also. Like things are going well at

741
00:49:50,485 --> 00:49:53,325
Speaker 2:  Meta, so coming out and being like, look, we have this cool thing that we

742
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:56,245
Speaker 2:  can't ship, but isn't it so cool? It just doesn't seem like it gains the

743
00:49:56,245 --> 00:49:59,965
Speaker 2:  company all that much. But I guess to your point, if they've been doing this

744
00:49:59,985 --> 00:50:03,765
Speaker 2:  now for six years, like literally maybe it's just for team morale, you

745
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:06,245
Speaker 2:  eventually have to show the people what you're working on. Like maybe it

746
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:07,085
Speaker 2:  really is just that simple.

747
00:50:07,565 --> 00:50:11,045
Speaker 18:  I think that's a huge piece of it. And you know, people don't like working

748
00:50:11,065 --> 00:50:14,685
Speaker 18:  on hardware that never ships and I think that was actually a big motivation

749
00:50:14,685 --> 00:50:18,485
Speaker 18:  with the Vision Pro finally launching. I think just after so many

750
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:22,325
Speaker 18:  years you've got to have something to show and yeah, I think

751
00:50:22,325 --> 00:50:25,925
Speaker 18:  meta being on its front foot versus its back foot this year means that,

752
00:50:26,145 --> 00:50:30,125
Speaker 18:  you know, they feel better about doing this. But I think, you know, to

753
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:33,885
Speaker 18:  your earlier point about like what's the motivation Snap and Meta's,

754
00:50:33,945 --> 00:50:37,365
Speaker 18:  you know, big picture motivation is actually very similar, which is that

755
00:50:37,595 --> 00:50:41,085
Speaker 18:  they both grew their businesses under the thumb of Apple and Google

756
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:45,165
Speaker 18:  and mobile phone app store control. And

757
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:49,405
Speaker 18:  if there is going to be a coming hardware shift where people use

758
00:50:49,475 --> 00:50:53,285
Speaker 18:  wearables at least as much as phones, if not more, they

759
00:50:53,285 --> 00:50:55,805
Speaker 18:  want to have a seat at the table and they want to control their own destiny.

760
00:50:56,025 --> 00:50:59,005
Speaker 18:  And Zuckerberg especially has been very clear about this in interviews with

761
00:50:59,005 --> 00:51:02,845
Speaker 18:  me and others, that this is a huge motivating factor. I mean

762
00:51:02,845 --> 00:51:06,165
Speaker 18:  he's been kind of Apple Public enemy number one for a while now

763
00:51:06,825 --> 00:51:10,525
Speaker 18:  and you know, I don't think that if Apple, you know, finally

764
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:14,245
Speaker 18:  releases air glasses in the coming years, like I don't think it's a given

765
00:51:14,265 --> 00:51:17,045
Speaker 18:  to assume that they would let Meta's apps on there. And I don't think meta

766
00:51:17,045 --> 00:51:21,005
Speaker 18:  thinks it's given that they would do that. And so if you are

767
00:51:21,015 --> 00:51:24,925
Speaker 18:  maybe gonna get boxed out in future hardware shifts, you know, you

768
00:51:24,925 --> 00:51:28,605
Speaker 18:  better play to win and you better have your own hardware and that's the

769
00:51:28,655 --> 00:51:32,565
Speaker 18:  motivation. But the question is, is that the right bet and is this

770
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:36,325
Speaker 18:  actually going to be hardware that normal people want to use

771
00:51:37,225 --> 00:51:39,805
Speaker 18:  in the coming years? And I think the jury's definitely out on that.

772
00:51:40,445 --> 00:51:44,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That tracks. But I, but I do think, I mean to your point, if this is

773
00:51:44,285 --> 00:51:47,245
Speaker 2:  the sort of thing that is going to happen, you, what is, what's the phrase?

774
00:51:47,245 --> 00:51:51,165
Speaker 2:  Slowly and then all at once. Yeah. Being early is much safer than being

775
00:51:51,165 --> 00:51:54,485
Speaker 2:  late. Right? Unless you're snap and you literally can't afford to have spent

776
00:51:54,485 --> 00:51:57,765
Speaker 2:  all this money. Like meta, meta can afford to be early, like literally with

777
00:51:57,765 --> 00:52:01,645
Speaker 2:  dollars afford to be early in a way that I think it, it seems to be

778
00:52:01,645 --> 00:52:02,845
Speaker 2:  willing to do that.

779
00:52:03,075 --> 00:52:06,565
Speaker 18:  Yeah. I mean look at Waymo and, and Google and self-driving, right? You

780
00:52:06,565 --> 00:52:09,885
Speaker 18:  know, they've, they've plowed billions of dollars into Waymo. There's been

781
00:52:10,035 --> 00:52:13,645
Speaker 18:  many years in the last decade where investors and the public are like, what

782
00:52:13,645 --> 00:52:16,805
Speaker 18:  are you doing? Just give up on this. It's never gonna work. All of a sudden

783
00:52:16,805 --> 00:52:20,085
Speaker 18:  it's starting to work. People are getting picked up by Waymo's from the

784
00:52:20,085 --> 00:52:23,925
Speaker 18:  airport, you know, they're out in the world working and now,

785
00:52:24,025 --> 00:52:27,965
Speaker 18:  you know, if, if it hits, if it really hits and it hits scale and

786
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:31,925
Speaker 18:  is like the next Uber but cheaper to run and it is this huge

787
00:52:32,165 --> 00:52:35,565
Speaker 18:  business benefit to Google, everyone will forgive the last 10 years

788
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:39,805
Speaker 18:  of, you know, sinking money into this for no result. And I think ar is

789
00:52:39,845 --> 00:52:43,445
Speaker 18:  a similar story with perhaps an even greater return because you know, VR

790
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:47,085
Speaker 18:  is something that's isolating and you wear mostly inside and by yourself.

791
00:52:47,105 --> 00:52:50,845
Speaker 18:  But the idea is that ar glasses are something you wear all day long

792
00:52:51,225 --> 00:52:54,845
Speaker 18:  and take with you and the time spent in them is, is huge.

793
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:59,085
Speaker 18:  'cause you wear, like if you're me, you wear glasses almost all day. And

794
00:52:59,525 --> 00:53:02,765
Speaker 18:  I think they see that as like a huge potential

795
00:53:03,425 --> 00:53:07,405
Speaker 18:  way to create a new business. And yeah, I just think that I,

796
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:09,805
Speaker 18:  I like that you brought up self-driving because I think there's a lot of

797
00:53:09,805 --> 00:53:10,365
Speaker 18:  analogies there.

798
00:53:10,675 --> 00:53:14,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no it makes sense. And I do feel like the AR thing is so funny 'cause

799
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:18,165
Speaker 2:  it's like, it's like the AI story in that the biggest version of the story

800
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:21,925
Speaker 2:  You can tell is so damn big that you like seem ridiculous

801
00:53:21,945 --> 00:53:24,805
Speaker 2:  if you don't try to chase it in some way, even though the odds of it getting

802
00:53:24,955 --> 00:53:28,325
Speaker 2:  yeah, as big as you want. Like it seems to me to be just as likely that everybody

803
00:53:28,325 --> 00:53:32,085
Speaker 2:  says No, I don't want a screen on my face. Thank you as they do to say

804
00:53:32,745 --> 00:53:36,725
Speaker 2:  yes ar glasses forever. But the possibility if it hits, it's gonna

805
00:53:36,745 --> 00:53:40,245
Speaker 2:  hit so big that there all of these companies are desperately afraid of not

806
00:53:40,435 --> 00:53:42,565
Speaker 2:  chasing that thing, right?

807
00:53:42,705 --> 00:53:46,525
Speaker 18:  And Meta has the money to be able to make this kind of bet and Snap increasingly

808
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:50,485
Speaker 18:  does not. And so the question is who is standing at the end of

809
00:53:50,485 --> 00:53:54,245
Speaker 18:  the next few years here and who has the ability to, to keep

810
00:53:54,245 --> 00:53:56,805
Speaker 18:  investing And I would put my money on Meta right now. Yeah,

811
00:53:57,005 --> 00:53:59,765
Speaker 2:  I I I tend to agree. Alright, one more question and then I will let you go.

812
00:54:00,105 --> 00:54:03,605
Speaker 2:  You mentioned these things are super expensive to make and that's one of

813
00:54:03,605 --> 00:54:06,005
Speaker 2:  the reasons these companies are not selling them. There was also a report

814
00:54:06,005 --> 00:54:09,925
Speaker 2:  from the information a few days ago that meta scrapped what I think was supposed

815
00:54:09,925 --> 00:54:13,845
Speaker 2:  to be its really high end project because they just never figured out a way

816
00:54:13,845 --> 00:54:17,765
Speaker 2:  to do it at the price that they wanted to. And Mark Zuckerberg

817
00:54:17,765 --> 00:54:21,685
Speaker 2:  has been saying to you and others for forever that price is really important

818
00:54:21,945 --> 00:54:25,805
Speaker 2:  in all of this stuff. And that one of the things Meta has been doing,

819
00:54:25,955 --> 00:54:29,325
Speaker 2:  like he, he sort of intimated kind of in as many words we could have made

820
00:54:29,325 --> 00:54:31,565
Speaker 2:  a thing as good as the Vision Pro, but we chose not to because it would've

821
00:54:31,565 --> 00:54:35,365
Speaker 2:  been too expensive. And I'm curious now having seen what we saw from the

822
00:54:35,365 --> 00:54:38,525
Speaker 2:  Vision Pro, both in terms of like how good the thing is, but also what it

823
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:42,445
Speaker 2:  has done in the world. What do you make of Meta's kind of

824
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:46,165
Speaker 2:  ongoing obsession with price? Like is this, is this the right move even in

825
00:54:46,165 --> 00:54:48,845
Speaker 2:  the early days of these things to only wanna sell things cheap?

826
00:54:49,345 --> 00:54:52,965
Speaker 18:  You know, I thought it was, but I don't know. I think these things need

827
00:54:52,965 --> 00:54:56,045
Speaker 18:  to be better products before we start really caring about price.

828
00:54:56,235 --> 00:54:59,125
Speaker 2:  Well that's the Apple be, right? Like who we're gonna make the best thing

829
00:54:59,325 --> 00:55:01,365
Speaker 2:  possible, whatever it costs and then we'll figure out how to make it cheaper.

830
00:55:01,555 --> 00:55:05,485
Speaker 18:  Yeah. And I think Meta has maybe focused and is continuing to focus a

831
00:55:05,485 --> 00:55:09,045
Speaker 18:  little too much on price, but it's not to say that the Quest is not a good

832
00:55:09,045 --> 00:55:12,725
Speaker 18:  product per se, but it's not something that I want to use,

833
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:16,725
Speaker 18:  let's put it that way. That's fair. And I think they have to figure

834
00:55:16,785 --> 00:55:20,645
Speaker 18:  out why people want to strap these things onto their

835
00:55:20,645 --> 00:55:24,525
Speaker 18:  face and that still has not really been figured out and

836
00:55:24,695 --> 00:55:28,445
Speaker 18:  price feels kind of secondary because it's like, oh I have this

837
00:55:28,755 --> 00:55:31,285
Speaker 18:  cheaper thing that you don't know how to use while you still don't know

838
00:55:31,285 --> 00:55:32,845
Speaker 18:  how to use it. So why would you buy it?

839
00:55:33,675 --> 00:55:36,605
Speaker 2:  It's an eighth, the price and still sort of pointless for you. Do you want

840
00:55:36,605 --> 00:55:36,885
Speaker 2:  it now?

841
00:55:37,015 --> 00:55:40,965
Speaker 18:  Right. But I think long term it is a iOS versus Android thing

842
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:44,765
Speaker 18:  all over again. Meta is going to be the cheaper, you know, your margin

843
00:55:44,825 --> 00:55:48,765
Speaker 18:  is my opportunity player here. Whereas Apple will be Apple and

844
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:51,965
Speaker 18:  have Apple margins and charge a lot of money because they can

845
00:55:52,585 --> 00:55:55,565
Speaker 18:  and they have a built-in, you know, loyalty base of people who will pay

846
00:55:56,005 --> 00:55:59,525
Speaker 18:  anything for a new Apple product. And I don't see that changing.

847
00:56:00,005 --> 00:56:03,685
Speaker 18:  I see meta canceling, you know, it's, it's high end kind of vision pro competitor

848
00:56:03,865 --> 00:56:07,485
Speaker 18:  as more of a realization that this highend market for these

849
00:56:07,485 --> 00:56:11,005
Speaker 18:  headsets, and I'm drawing a distinction between these headsets and air glasses,

850
00:56:11,225 --> 00:56:14,885
Speaker 18:  but headsets at a high end, even with great displays,

851
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:18,525
Speaker 18:  the market's just not there yet and the software ecosystem's not there.

852
00:56:18,535 --> 00:56:22,525
Speaker 18:  We've seen that with the Vision Pro in the last year and for Meta I think

853
00:56:22,525 --> 00:56:25,925
Speaker 18:  it makes more sense for them to play at the lower end and let Apple have

854
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:26,485
Speaker 18:  the higher end.

855
00:56:26,795 --> 00:56:29,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean that to me is the lesson of the Ray bands, right? Yeah. That

856
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:33,765
Speaker 2:  it's like actually if you take something that does substantially

857
00:56:34,035 --> 00:56:37,485
Speaker 2:  less but make it sort of socially workable

858
00:56:37,825 --> 00:56:41,765
Speaker 2:  and make it good, you have something like that to me feels like a

859
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:45,165
Speaker 2:  much saner starting point for, what are they, they're they're like

860
00:56:45,165 --> 00:56:46,485
Speaker 2:  350 bucks I think.

861
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:47,965
Speaker 18:  Yeah. And You can buy 'em with insurance

862
01:00:29,805 --> 01:00:33,725
Speaker 2:  email is vergecast at The Verge dot com. You can hit me up on threads. I

863
01:00:33,725 --> 01:00:34,405
Speaker 2:  don't know, we're

864
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:19,965
Speaker 22:  some people are ahead right now or will a company we've never heard of

865
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:22,245
Speaker 22:  probably be the winner in the long run? Thanks.

866
01:01:23,025 --> 01:01:26,845
Speaker 2:  So this question comes at a really funny time because I just had a long conversation

867
01:01:27,235 --> 01:01:30,805
Speaker 2:  with someone in the tech industry about more or less this

868
01:01:31,525 --> 01:01:35,205
Speaker 2:  question, the question of whether or not the

869
01:01:35,345 --> 01:01:39,165
Speaker 2:  AI industry is going to calcify, right? On the one hand

870
01:01:39,545 --> 01:01:43,445
Speaker 2:  you have the fact that these things are vastly more expensive

871
01:01:43,505 --> 01:01:47,325
Speaker 2:  all the time to train these models are super complicated, super humongous.

872
01:01:47,385 --> 01:01:51,085
Speaker 2:  You need a lot of Nvidia chips that are hard to get like

873
01:01:51,345 --> 01:01:55,245
Speaker 2:  it. It is very, very hard to go from nothing to competitive in

874
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:59,125
Speaker 2:  the AI world. On the other hand, it feels like it's

875
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:02,885
Speaker 2:  moving faster than ever. AI is going from meaning one thing to meaning

876
01:02:02,955 --> 01:02:06,645
Speaker 2:  lots of things. There are lots of companies with lots of resources that have

877
01:02:06,645 --> 01:02:10,485
Speaker 2:  not started playing this game in this kind of way. So it

878
01:02:10,485 --> 01:02:14,285
Speaker 2:  both feels like there are big players and like nothing

879
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:18,245
Speaker 2:  has yet been decided. But to the question of first mover advantage, I have

880
01:02:18,245 --> 01:02:22,045
Speaker 2:  two thoughts on this. One is that I think pretty clearly there

881
01:02:22,185 --> 01:02:26,125
Speaker 2:  was some first mover advantage when Chat GPT came out at the end of

882
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:29,965
Speaker 2:  2022 that changed the industry, right? Like you, you

883
01:02:29,965 --> 01:02:33,645
Speaker 2:  really cannot overstate the extent to which there is a tech industry before

884
01:02:33,665 --> 01:02:37,205
Speaker 2:  the launch of chat GPT. And there is a tech industry after the launch of

885
01:02:37,365 --> 01:02:41,245
Speaker 2:  chat GBT, right or wrong, correct or incorrect. The thing that

886
01:02:41,445 --> 01:02:45,205
Speaker 2:  happened when chat GBT came out and a hundred million people used it

887
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:49,165
Speaker 2:  and went, oh my god, This is the future, changed

888
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:52,845
Speaker 2:  everything, right? And all of these companies had to scramble to keep

889
01:02:52,945 --> 01:02:56,725
Speaker 2:  up. Google basically completely changed its company around

890
01:02:57,065 --> 01:03:00,725
Speaker 2:  ai. Microsoft started spinning up lots of new things. It had some

891
01:03:00,725 --> 01:03:04,605
Speaker 2:  advantage just by virtue of its existing relationship with open ai. All

892
01:03:04,605 --> 01:03:07,605
Speaker 2:  these other companies that had been working on AI stuff kind of in the background

893
01:03:07,605 --> 01:03:11,165
Speaker 2:  is a research project over the years. Like AI is not a new thing, but

894
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:15,205
Speaker 2:  AI as a consumer product is new. And chat

895
01:03:15,365 --> 01:03:18,485
Speaker 2:  GPT, which I feel like I've said this a million times, but

896
01:03:18,985 --> 01:03:22,365
Speaker 2:  OpenAI did not understand the extent to which this is going to be a hit consumer

897
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:26,325
Speaker 2:  product. So it was not ready for this either. But we've gotten

898
01:03:26,325 --> 01:03:30,005
Speaker 2:  to the point now where OpenAI is the biggest name in AI and it's not close.

899
01:03:30,165 --> 01:03:32,845
Speaker 2:  I think You can have interesting arguments about who's tech is the best and

900
01:03:33,045 --> 01:03:36,925
Speaker 2:  who's best positioned and whatever. But OpenAI is a household name and that

901
01:03:36,925 --> 01:03:40,725
Speaker 2:  is because of chat. GPT Chat. GPT is a household name. GPT as

902
01:03:40,805 --> 01:03:44,325
Speaker 2:  a thing is a household name. People use that term

903
01:03:44,515 --> 01:03:47,925
Speaker 2:  like they do ATM. It's nuts. I hate that we've allowed this to happen,

904
01:03:48,345 --> 01:03:52,205
Speaker 2:  but here we are. We just use GPT in conversation. So,

905
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:56,125
Speaker 2:  I think to one extent, OpenAI bought itself a lot

906
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:59,685
Speaker 2:  of time and a lot of reputation and a lot of runway by being

907
01:03:59,855 --> 01:04:03,725
Speaker 2:  first. It was also better than pretty much everything else that

908
01:04:03,725 --> 01:04:07,565
Speaker 2:  came out right after both because it went first and because it was just better.

909
01:04:07,665 --> 01:04:10,245
Speaker 2:  OpenAI had very good tech, they've been working on this for a long time.

910
01:04:10,595 --> 01:04:14,285
Speaker 2:  Chat GPT was well ahead of everybody else. I don't think that's that

911
01:04:14,315 --> 01:04:18,245
Speaker 2:  true anymore. It feels like for really the last, I don't

912
01:04:18,245 --> 01:04:21,885
Speaker 2:  know year, but especially over the last six months, every couple of weeks

913
01:04:22,555 --> 01:04:26,405
Speaker 2:  some company has released a new model that they claim is, you know, a a

914
01:04:26,595 --> 01:04:30,245
Speaker 2:  step better than all of the other models, right? You have open AI doing it

915
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:33,805
Speaker 2:  with all the GPTs. Anthropic is doing it with the various versions of Claude.

916
01:04:33,805 --> 01:04:36,845
Speaker 2:  Google is doing it with Gemini and Meta is doing it with Llama. There's this

917
01:04:36,845 --> 01:04:40,525
Speaker 2:  incredible arms race. As these models get bigger,

918
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:44,005
Speaker 2:  they get faster, they get more efficient, they get cheaper for developers

919
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:47,645
Speaker 2:  to, they get cheaper for the companies to run. So you you, we have this

920
01:04:47,645 --> 01:04:51,405
Speaker 2:  incredible sort of leapfrogging game happening between all of these companies.

921
01:04:51,825 --> 01:04:55,085
Speaker 2:  On the one hand that kind of negates the first mover advantage, right? You

922
01:04:55,085 --> 01:04:58,845
Speaker 2:  can argue Anthropic was late to this game, but I think it's caught up in

923
01:04:58,845 --> 01:05:02,525
Speaker 2:  a really big way. I hear a lot of people talking about Claude,

924
01:05:02,695 --> 01:05:06,005
Speaker 2:  which is Anthropics model kind of its version of chat GPT

925
01:05:06,495 --> 01:05:10,005
Speaker 2:  being better and more fun to use and more useful than

926
01:05:10,275 --> 01:05:14,005
Speaker 2:  chat GPT and Gemini. I think because of the way that

927
01:05:14,005 --> 01:05:17,965
Speaker 2:  it's integrated with other Google services has some huge advantages.

928
01:05:18,155 --> 01:05:22,045
Speaker 2:  What Microsoft is doing with copilot, which is kind of associated with but

929
01:05:22,045 --> 01:05:25,885
Speaker 2:  not the same as open AI stuff, is also the same, right? So you have these

930
01:05:26,085 --> 01:05:29,685
Speaker 2:  companies that have other huge advantages, which is basically they can attach

931
01:05:29,905 --> 01:05:32,845
Speaker 2:  AI to their products that is going to make it easy for them to catch up.

932
01:05:33,185 --> 01:05:37,045
Speaker 2:  The flip side is that as these models get bigger and as they get

933
01:05:37,045 --> 01:05:40,485
Speaker 2:  more complicated and as they get more impressive,

934
01:05:40,905 --> 01:05:44,645
Speaker 2:  the cost to build one just goes through the roof. Like the, these things

935
01:05:44,705 --> 01:05:48,645
Speaker 2:  are so unbelievably expensive to train, forget about running them

936
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:51,285
Speaker 2:  and the cost every time somebody queries it. And you have to actually process

937
01:05:51,285 --> 01:05:55,085
Speaker 2:  their information through this trend model. The cost of training

938
01:05:55,085 --> 01:05:58,605
Speaker 2:  these models is so, so, so high and

939
01:05:59,025 --> 01:06:02,285
Speaker 2:  not gonna go down, right? The only way these things get better is if they

940
01:06:02,285 --> 01:06:06,245
Speaker 2:  get bigger and they do more. And for these kind of catchall models,

941
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:09,685
Speaker 2:  it's just gonna be a few companies that can do it. I don't think that's that

942
01:06:09,685 --> 01:06:13,445
Speaker 2:  different from what we've seen before. I mean think about like cloud resources,

943
01:06:13,445 --> 01:06:17,005
Speaker 2:  right? You have AWS, you have Microsoft Azure and you have Google Cloud.

944
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:21,085
Speaker 2:  Other companies can be in that game, but you have to have unbelievable

945
01:06:21,085 --> 01:06:24,165
Speaker 2:  amounts of resources to have the amount of computing power, just the number

946
01:06:24,165 --> 01:06:27,805
Speaker 2:  of data centers, the number of employees, what it takes to really operate

947
01:06:27,845 --> 01:06:31,525
Speaker 2:  a global cloud network just isn't available to most

948
01:06:31,765 --> 01:06:32,925
Speaker 2:  companies. And the same is gonna be true

949
01:07:10,205 --> 01:07:13,365
Speaker 2:  Chad GPT is. But there's also tons of

950
01:07:13,835 --> 01:07:17,685
Speaker 2:  smaller and different and more specific things. And, if you

951
01:07:17,685 --> 01:07:21,525
Speaker 2:  think about AI in those terms, we're just at the very beginning of

952
01:07:21,565 --> 01:07:25,485
Speaker 2:  a huge culture shift that doesn't actually depend all

953
01:07:25,485 --> 01:07:29,245
Speaker 2:  that much on the models that companies like OpenAI are generating.

954
01:07:29,585 --> 01:07:32,645
Speaker 2:  As this stuff gets more open source, there's gonna be more access for this

955
01:07:32,645 --> 01:07:36,085
Speaker 2:  stuff. I think we're starting to see some of these models get commoditized

956
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:39,525
Speaker 2:  to the point where having the biggest, newest model is only going to be useful

957
01:07:39,525 --> 01:07:42,565
Speaker 2:  for some things and that most people will be perfectly happy with the local

958
01:07:42,565 --> 01:07:46,325
Speaker 2:  models that are able to run faster and locally on your computer or

959
01:07:46,825 --> 01:07:50,645
Speaker 2:  the simple models that can run on lower end hardware, that run on TVs and

960
01:07:50,645 --> 01:07:54,125
Speaker 2:  things like that. So what you're looking at instead of a race to the top

961
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:58,445
Speaker 2:  for these most impressive models, you're looking at just this kind of incredible

962
01:07:58,595 --> 01:08:01,925
Speaker 2:  splintering around the whole industry. And if that's what's gonna happen,

963
01:08:02,335 --> 01:08:05,845
Speaker 2:  there won't be a first mover advantage in the same way that there wasn't

964
01:08:05,845 --> 01:08:09,725
Speaker 2:  a first mover advantage, like being the first website on the internet. It's

965
01:08:09,725 --> 01:08:13,605
Speaker 2:  cool, it comes with some upsides, it might give you a lead, but the

966
01:08:13,605 --> 01:08:17,485
Speaker 2:  thing that there is out there is way too big for any one company to win anyway.

967
01:08:18,085 --> 01:08:21,965
Speaker 2:  I think it could go either way. And I think right now if you're OpenAI, you

968
01:08:21,965 --> 01:08:25,405
Speaker 2:  have so much cache and so much

969
01:08:25,825 --> 01:08:29,765
Speaker 2:  upside and the fact that Sam Altman is like the face of AI as a thing

970
01:08:30,025 --> 01:08:33,605
Speaker 2:  is really useful to OpenAI and we will keep propelling

971
01:08:34,065 --> 01:08:37,405
Speaker 2:  AI at the top of this industry and getting media coverage and getting developer

972
01:08:37,565 --> 01:08:41,285
Speaker 2:  interests and all this stuff for a long time. But if AI is not

973
01:08:41,595 --> 01:08:45,245
Speaker 2:  just for companies giving you models that You can do everything on,

974
01:08:45,505 --> 01:08:49,325
Speaker 2:  but is actually as big as everybody says, it's too big for any one

975
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:53,085
Speaker 2:  company to be in charge of. I know that's not really an answer. It's a little

976
01:08:53,085 --> 01:08:56,525
Speaker 2:  bit of both. There is a first mover advantage, but I think it's gonna get

977
01:08:56,525 --> 01:09:00,445
Speaker 2:  away from everybody and I also think it's too complicated for that. I hope

978
01:09:00,445 --> 01:09:04,405
Speaker 2:  that helps. Alright, that is it for The Vergecast today. Thank you
