Description: Before a podcast was a “podcast,” it was… well, it wasn’t really much of anything. It was in 2004, though, that many of the earliest names in on-demand audio began to smush “iPod” and “broadcast” into the word we’ve come to know as the way we all download and listen to shows now. In this episode, we go back two decades to the first days of the podcast. Then we hit the skip button to today and look at where podcasts are headed next.

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:06,635
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of our Ss.

3
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:10,435
Speaker 2:  Enclosures. I'm your friend David Pierce and I am sitting in my car

4
00:00:10,705 --> 00:00:14,515
Speaker 2:  recording a Podcast So. Our episode today is all about the

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:18,235
Speaker 2:  early days of podcasting. We're doing this whole big package of stories

6
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:22,195
Speaker 2:  on The Verge all week, all about 2004. The stuff that

7
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:26,235
Speaker 2:  happened in 2004, the legacy of that year, 20 years later,

8
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:30,035
Speaker 2:  which is a surprisingly consequential one in tech. it was the year Google

9
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:33,235
Speaker 2:  went public, it was the year Gmail was created, it was the year Facebook

10
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:37,355
Speaker 2:  launched, it was the year dig launched. it was the year that Firefox browser

11
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,955
Speaker 2:  became a thing. it was the year of Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction,

12
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:44,475
Speaker 2:  which was a huge deal that changed the streaming and television worlds forever,

13
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:48,795
Speaker 2:  all kinds of stuff. But for this episode of The Vergecast,

14
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:52,275
Speaker 2:  we're re gonna talk about the word podcast because the word podcast

15
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:57,195
Speaker 2:  became a word and came to describe this whole industry.

16
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:01,395
Speaker 2:  This whole thing we're doing right now back in 2004 So, we're re gonna

17
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:05,355
Speaker 2:  talk about where that name came from. What it has come to mean and then What

18
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:09,115
Speaker 2:  might happen in the next 20 years. But the thing I've

19
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,435
Speaker 2:  discovered in doing all this research and in talking to a bunch of people

20
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:15,035
Speaker 2:  who were around in those early days is that a surprising number of

21
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:19,035
Speaker 2:  people were just sitting in their car making Podcasts.

22
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:22,435
Speaker 2:  Back then They were, you know, talking into microphones or had really

23
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:26,635
Speaker 2:  crude sort of rudimentary cell phone setups that They could call into with

24
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:30,315
Speaker 2:  a phone number and record a podcast that way. But the acoustics of a car

25
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:33,955
Speaker 2:  are pretty good. It does a pretty good job of dampening noise and

26
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:38,115
Speaker 2:  echoes and all kinds of issues. So the car, it doesn't Look great, but

27
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:41,875
Speaker 2:  it turns out to be a half decent place to make a podcast. So here. I am

28
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,875
Speaker 2:  in the car making a podcast just like our, our good

29
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:50,355
Speaker 2:  forefathers of the podcast years did So, Anyway, all of that is

30
00:01:50,355 --> 00:01:53,835
Speaker 2:  coming up. We're re gonna talk about the past, the present, and the future

31
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:57,635
Speaker 2:  of Podcasts on this whole episode. It's very meta, it's a super fun

32
00:01:57,635 --> 00:02:00,675
Speaker 2:  episode. I'm really excited about it. All of that is coming up in just a

33
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:04,555
Speaker 2:  second, but it's warm out and I had to turn the car off to do this. I

34
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:08,035
Speaker 2:  don't know how people made Podcasts when like the air conditioning was running

35
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:12,235
Speaker 2:  and everything was insane, but right now it is too hot in

36
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:15,435
Speaker 2:  here and it has to stop. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

37
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,765
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Do you remember when you first heard about

38
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:08,805
Speaker 2:  Podcasts? If you've been listening to this show, The Vergecast since

39
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:12,765
Speaker 2:  2011, maybe it was that or If, you were a listener of

40
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:16,685
Speaker 2:  the End Gadget podcast before even that, maybe that's where you

41
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:20,965
Speaker 2:  got into it. Or really to be way less self-absorbed and much

42
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:24,725
Speaker 2:  more realistic about it. Maybe it was Serial in 2014

43
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:28,605
Speaker 2:  that turned you and frankly millions of other people onto

44
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:32,365
Speaker 2:  the idea of Radio on Demand. That's when Podcasts

45
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:36,485
Speaker 2:  became a thing. But I bet that for most people the

46
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:40,445
Speaker 2:  farthest possible distance back you could go would be this moment.

47
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:43,805
Speaker 2:  In 2005 when Steve Jobs got on stage at

48
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:47,685
Speaker 2:  WWDC and before he announced that Apple was switching to using Intel

49
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,645
Speaker 2:  chips and before he said that leopard would be the next version of Mac Os,

50
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:54,885
Speaker 2:  he explained to a lot of people why They were about to start seeing Podcasts

51
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:55,765
Speaker 2:  in iTunes.

52
00:03:56,585 --> 00:04:00,085
Speaker 5:  As you know, the podcasting phenomenon is exploding right now,

53
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:04,525
Speaker 5:  and podcasting of course is a concatenation of iPod and broadcasting

54
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:07,445
Speaker 5:  and What is podcasting. You know, it's been described a lot of different

55
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:11,325
Speaker 5:  ways. One way has been TiVo for radio. You

56
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:15,245
Speaker 5:  can download radio shows and listen to 'em on your computer or put 'em on

57
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:18,485
Speaker 5:  your iPod anytime you want. So, it's just like television programs on TiVo

58
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:22,605
Speaker 5:  and that's true. Another way it's been described is Wayne's World for

59
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:26,365
Speaker 5:  radio, which means that anyone without

60
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:30,245
Speaker 5:  much capital investment can make a podcast, put it on a server and get a

61
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:33,965
Speaker 5:  worldwide audience for their radio show. And that's true too.

62
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:37,725
Speaker 5:  We see it as the hottest thing going in radio.

63
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:42,795
Speaker 2:  A fun fact from that one, by the way, jobs talked about how There were 8,000

64
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:46,755
Speaker 2:  Podcasts available at that time in 2005 and that was a huge number. He

65
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:50,275
Speaker 2:  was really excited about it. Now that number is somewhere between three and

66
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:54,155
Speaker 2:  5 million. Podcasts lots changed Anyway.

67
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:58,235
Speaker 2:  A lot of people credit jobs with mainstreaming both the word

68
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:02,275
Speaker 2:  and the concept of Podcasts, which is probably at least a little true

69
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:06,275
Speaker 2:  podcast, was the Oxford Dictionary's word of the year in 2005.

70
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:10,115
Speaker 2:  It beat out in case you're wondering Bird flu, reggaeton,

71
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:14,315
Speaker 2:  Life, hack, whole bunch of other stuff. But jobs didn't create the

72
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:18,155
Speaker 2:  concept or the word the concept. I think is

73
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:21,835
Speaker 2:  the one of those two that is trickiest to figure out. Technically you could

74
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:25,315
Speaker 2:  argue that the idea of a podcast is just like radio and we've had that around

75
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:29,195
Speaker 2:  forever, but I think you can make a pretty good case that the

76
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,635
Speaker 2:  thing We now know as a podcast became a thing in about

77
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:36,195
Speaker 2:  2003 and it involved a guy named Chris Leiden.

78
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:40,755
Speaker 4:  It was a very exciting coincidence for me. For one thing, I I had

79
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:44,235
Speaker 4:  been Ignominiously bumped out of a wonderful job in public radio

80
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:48,715
Speaker 4:  and looking for something new. So. Charlie Nessen at Berkman Center said,

81
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:52,835
Speaker 4:  come and think with us. Dave Weiner arrived a few

82
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:56,795
Speaker 4:  weeks later and he said, well, Charlie told me

83
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:58,005
Speaker 4:  David Weiner was coming.

84
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:01,805
Speaker 2:  Charles Nessen, by the way, was the creator of the Berkman Klein Center for

85
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:05,525
Speaker 2:  Internet and Society, which was kind of an early internet think tank at Harvard

86
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:09,645
Speaker 2:  that actually still does a lot of really interesting digital work. Dave

87
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:13,205
Speaker 2:  Weiner is one of the Internet's earliest and longest tenured bloggers. His

88
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:16,765
Speaker 2:  blog just turned 30 last week. He's also a key creator of

89
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:20,685
Speaker 2:  RSS, which is the technology that spreads feeds of content around the internet

90
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:24,805
Speaker 2:  and he's just a guy who cares a lot about web publishing standards At the

91
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:28,765
Speaker 2:  time. If, you wanted to start a blog calling Dave Weiner was like calling

92
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:32,245
Speaker 2:  Gordon Ramsey for tips on how to open a restaurant and Chris Leiden

93
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:33,125
Speaker 2:  hit him up.

94
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:37,685
Speaker 4:  I wrote to Dave Wine saying six months ago, I couldn't spell blog.

95
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:41,645
Speaker 4:  Now I want a B one. and we went through the blog cycle very, very

96
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:45,205
Speaker 4:  quickly. But then he said, you know, radio I know

97
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:48,765
Speaker 4:  programming What the world needs is an MP three file that can

98
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:53,085
Speaker 4:  go worldwide instantly. I said, sounds good to me and

99
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:57,285
Speaker 4:  we got to work. It only took oh couple of months let's say,

100
00:06:58,105 --> 00:07:01,205
Speaker 4:  and he said, I, think we got it. I said, now What Day. He said, well that's

101
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:03,765
Speaker 4:  obvious you're gonna do a conversation with me and we're gonna put it out.

102
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:04,285
Speaker 4:  and we did

103
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:08,475
Speaker 2:  Leiden and Weiner ended up publishing that conversation in July of

104
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:12,395
Speaker 2:  2003 and I just wanna play you the first 30 seconds or So of it,

105
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:14,795
Speaker 2:  which I found. By the way, thanks to James Cridland

106
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:18,755
Speaker 2:  over@podnews.net. He did a great whole big

107
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:21,595
Speaker 2:  thing on The history of the word podcast and we're actually gonna talk to

108
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:25,395
Speaker 2:  him about the future of Podcasts later in the show. Anyway here it's Dave

109
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:29,075
Speaker 4:  Weiner I. Feel like a new immigrant in this blogger world where you're a

110
00:07:29,145 --> 00:07:33,075
Speaker 4:  kind of founding father. Walk me around it and I'm

111
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:36,515
Speaker 4:  not talking about the technology I wanna know What kind of democratic

112
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,315
Speaker 4:  experiment. This blog idea really amounts to,

113
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:44,355
Speaker 6:  Well gosh, it changes all the time. I mean when we first

114
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:48,275
Speaker 6:  started doing this, it was just a bunch of people sort of

115
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:53,115
Speaker 6:  writing hello world and being amazed that

116
00:07:53,415 --> 00:07:57,315
Speaker 6:  it was possible to do that and and then the next

117
00:07:57,315 --> 00:08:00,955
Speaker 6:  step was recognition of other people and say, wow, there's somebody else

118
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:04,875
Speaker 6:  doing this and learning how to

119
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:06,235
Speaker 6:  communicate and

120
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:11,635
Speaker 6:  gosh, I don't know how to answer that question. I mean it is What you make

121
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:15,235
Speaker 6:  of it. Everybody brings something different to it and different set of expectations

122
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,755
Speaker 6:  and everybody molds it to be whatever it means to them.

123
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:22,595
Speaker 2:  They don't call What, they're doing There a Podcast, but I mean that's a

124
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:26,155
Speaker 2:  podcast, right? There like it's two dudes talking tech.

125
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:30,115
Speaker 2:  It's all very meta. The sound quality is good but kind of messy.

126
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:34,555
Speaker 2:  That's all the hallmarks of Podcasts all in one place. And

127
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:38,275
Speaker 2:  I think the thing that whiner says at the very end, it is What you make of

128
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:41,875
Speaker 2:  it turned out to be more prescient than maybe either of them realized at

129
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:45,595
Speaker 2:  the time, but still, They weren't calling it a podcast, nobody

130
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:49,155
Speaker 2:  was. They were calling these things audio blogs if They were calling them

131
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:53,355
Speaker 2:  anything, There were a handful of them out There, but none of them were Podcasts

132
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:57,645
Speaker 2:  until Ben Hammersley showed up. Ben I should say right up front

133
00:08:58,145 --> 00:09:02,045
Speaker 2:  is not exactly psyched that he is part of this particular slice of

134
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:02,845
Speaker 2:  podcast history.

135
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:06,685
Speaker 7:  It was in fucking bane in my Life because there's absolutely no

136
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:11,485
Speaker 7:  honor in the origin story, right? That

137
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:15,545
Speaker 7:  you know, when I die, I want to be remembered for

138
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,745
Speaker 7:  I don't know a 20 year project or something or saving

139
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:22,665
Speaker 7:  orphans from a burning building or or something,

140
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:27,025
Speaker 7:  something like that. Rather than a word that was invented in a sort of deadline

141
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:31,065
Speaker 7:  frenzy that I didn't even realize I was doing until a few

142
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:31,465
Speaker 7:  months later.

143
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:36,305
Speaker 2:  In 2004, Ben was working on some early RSS in publishing tech

144
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:40,065
Speaker 2:  and was also writing about the burgeoning tech industry for The Guardian.

145
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:44,505
Speaker 2:  And in February of 2004 he published a piece called Audible revolution.

146
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:48,865
Speaker 2:  All about the cool stuff people were doing online with audio at

147
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:52,465
Speaker 2:  the time, There were people building software that could automatically record

148
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:55,985
Speaker 2:  radio streams over the internet and make them available for listening later.

149
00:09:56,485 --> 00:10:00,265
Speaker 2:  The iPod obviously was everywhere and people were also building software

150
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:03,065
Speaker 2:  to take all those streams that you had downloaded and put them onto your

151
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:06,945
Speaker 2:  iPod one step at a time. All of this stuff was starting to come together.

152
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:11,785
Speaker 2:  Ben actually interviewed Chris Leiden for the piece that he wrote and Leiden

153
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:15,505
Speaker 2:  talked about how audio over the web was gonna change people's relationships

154
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:19,345
Speaker 2:  with their audience. it was gonna democratize media. They had all these big

155
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:22,505
Speaker 2:  high-minded ideas about What audio might do,

156
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:27,065
Speaker 2:  but it's right There in the second paragraph of the story that Ben Hammersley

157
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:30,665
Speaker 2:  does. The thing, actually, lemme just read you the first two paragraphs

158
00:10:31,335 --> 00:10:35,105
Speaker 2:  with the benefit of hindsight. It all seems quite obvious. MP three players

159
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:38,905
Speaker 2:  like Apple's, iPod in many pockets, audio production software, cheap or

160
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,665
Speaker 2:  free and web logging an established part of the internet, all the ingredients

161
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:46,585
Speaker 2:  are There for a new boom in amateur radio, but What to call it

162
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:49,945
Speaker 2:  audio blogging, podcasting, gorilla Media

163
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:54,965
Speaker 2:  There, it is that almost everyone agrees is the first published

164
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:58,925
Speaker 2:  use of the word podcasting. It's a big moment. Of course, Ben

165
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:02,245
Speaker 2:  had absolutely no idea What he was doing when he wrote that word. The

166
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:06,405
Speaker 7:  Guardian at the time was a print first paper as in you wrote

167
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:10,365
Speaker 7:  for the paper and you had a print deadline when the physical printing presses

168
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:13,125
Speaker 7:  would run at six o'clock and If, you

169
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:17,925
Speaker 7:  missed that deadline. The the words weren't going to go onto the

170
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:21,605
Speaker 7:  page and that meant that every

171
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:25,685
Speaker 7:  day the sort of working rhythm was that There was this big rush to get everything

172
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,565
Speaker 7:  done by quarter to six or whatever. And

173
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:33,805
Speaker 7:  I'd written this article and about five 30 or So, you know,

174
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:37,725
Speaker 7:  just before the print deadline I get a an email from my

175
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:41,445
Speaker 7:  editor saying we've put it on the page and it's very nice but

176
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:44,805
Speaker 7:  it it is kind of a line short and it doesn't Look very

177
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:49,125
Speaker 7:  good on the page. You know the, the text hasn't gone green in the typesetting

178
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,925
Speaker 7:  program. Can you write me another sentence just to

179
00:11:52,975 --> 00:11:56,215
Speaker 7:  pad it out, right? Just to make it fit beautifully on the printed page and

180
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,335
Speaker 7:  So I wrote an extra sentence and emailed it over and the sentence is this

181
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:03,175
Speaker 7:  sort of like mildly meaningless sentence of, but What do we call this

182
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:06,295
Speaker 7:  new phenomenon. And then I sort of invented three words and put 'em in There

183
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:08,455
Speaker 7:  and then sent it off and then I went to the pub

184
00:12:09,915 --> 00:12:13,765
Speaker 2:  Look. On the one hand, thank God we call it podcasting and not

185
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:17,485
Speaker 2:  Gorilla Mediaing, you know, What I mean, but Ben doesn't even

186
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:21,765
Speaker 2:  remember how he came up with podcast. Everyone now says it's a Port

187
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:25,205
Speaker 2:  manto of iPod and broadcast, which is What. Steve Jobs said in that clip

188
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:29,165
Speaker 2:  earlier and Ben basically just said, yeah, that seems reasonable

189
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:33,125
Speaker 2:  enough, but he doesn't even remember coming up with it. He also at

190
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:36,605
Speaker 2:  the time had no idea, truly no idea

191
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:37,645
Speaker 2:  What he had done.

192
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:41,925
Speaker 7:  And it was only a few months later that I got emails from, from the Oxford

193
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:45,645
Speaker 7:  English dictionary saying, where, where do you find this word? We, we're

194
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:49,365
Speaker 7:  trying to find an earlier citation for it than than your piece. And, and

195
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:52,765
Speaker 7:  we can't, where did you get it? And I, you know,

196
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:57,085
Speaker 7:  pulled it out the back of my head on a, on a deadline panic. I I had no idea

197
00:12:57,145 --> 00:13:00,885
Speaker 7:  and I looked on all of the RSS related

198
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:04,525
Speaker 7:  development mailing lists and So on which, which is What the place where

199
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:07,685
Speaker 7:  it would've been. And I couldn't find any trace of it either.

200
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:11,005
Speaker 7:  And So I said, well clearly I just must have made it up. And then he said,

201
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:14,765
Speaker 7:  great, because it's word of the year. And then, you know, and

202
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:17,965
Speaker 7:  then it became the thing that Apple took on and that's What They called their

203
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:21,125
Speaker 7:  app and that's What it became known as, and you know, the rest is history.

204
00:13:21,825 --> 00:13:25,445
Speaker 2:  Ben made very clear several times when we talked that he didn't

205
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:29,285
Speaker 2:  invent the idea of a podcast and nor does he deserve credit for What

206
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:32,935
Speaker 2:  Podcasts eventually became, but all these years later

207
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:37,015
Speaker 2:  he does seem to kind of like the word he came up with, it's got that nice

208
00:13:37,325 --> 00:13:40,855
Speaker 2:  plosive p you can use it as a noun or a verb pretty easily.

209
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:43,695
Speaker 2:  It's a good useful word that way,

210
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:48,745
Speaker 7:  But also that within it There are context clues that Normies could understand.

211
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:53,185
Speaker 7:  Hmm, So, you know, the iPod was the biggest thing in the

212
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:56,335
Speaker 7:  world at that time and that's where the pod bit comes from.

213
00:13:57,155 --> 00:14:00,175
Speaker 7:  And although it was super fiddly at the beginning to, to take these Podcasts

214
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:04,135
Speaker 7:  and put them onto your iPod pretty rapidly, some software came out

215
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,935
Speaker 7:  There and made that simpler. And then soon after that Apple made it possible

216
00:14:07,935 --> 00:14:11,865
Speaker 7:  within iTunes and to

217
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:15,735
Speaker 7:  say it's kind of like TiVo for radio

218
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:19,505
Speaker 7:  that you listen to on your MP three player is a pretty good

219
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:23,305
Speaker 7:  sentence in 2002, 2003. Yeah. Right.

220
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:28,345
Speaker 7:  To sort of not, not necessarily to hugely techie circles or, or even like

221
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:32,295
Speaker 7:  super early adopters, but to sort of, you know, the, the whoever, whoever

222
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:36,045
Speaker 7:  comes after the early adopters, those people, you know, They They can understand

223
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:38,645
Speaker 7:  it and So it I think it becomes one of those things where

224
00:14:39,915 --> 00:14:43,795
Speaker 7:  it's a fun word to say but also it kind of has meaning within

225
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:47,755
Speaker 7:  it that somebody who's used to new

226
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:51,405
Speaker 7:  technologies can kind of understand straight away

227
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:55,445
Speaker 7:  and, and So and it becomes a self evidently good idea,

228
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:59,565
Speaker 7:  right? And then when you have a few years later you have these

229
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:03,925
Speaker 7:  very successful professionally made Podcasts, which take full advantage or

230
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:07,365
Speaker 7:  start to take full advantage of the, of the fact that they're at liberty

231
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:11,365
Speaker 7:  to use as much space or as little space as They need, as much time as

232
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:14,445
Speaker 7:  little time, different episode lengths, all that sort of thing

233
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:19,125
Speaker 7:  that people started exploring that and, and being able to self commission

234
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:23,045
Speaker 7:  and make, make programs that were something you would never, ever

235
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:25,925
Speaker 7:  have heard before on regular Bull Cross radio then,

236
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:30,725
Speaker 7:  then suddenly it becomes, it wasn own it was own thing very rapidly and people

237
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:34,205
Speaker 7:  start to see the value of it hugely tied in with

238
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:38,485
Speaker 7:  the call it Skagit on the market at the time. So, I think it, it, it,

239
00:15:38,825 --> 00:15:41,525
Speaker 7:  it sort of catches that lightning of all of those different things happening

240
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:41,885
Speaker 7:  At the same time,

241
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:46,365
Speaker 2:  Most people do seem to agree that Ben coined the term

242
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:50,445
Speaker 2:  podcast or at least used it first. But There is one other person in the

243
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:54,405
Speaker 2:  equation who definitely deserves credit. That's Danny Gregoire who's a

244
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:58,365
Speaker 2:  software engineer who used the word in an email to a list of folks working

245
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,445
Speaker 2:  on and with an app called iPod. iPod was one of those things that could

246
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:05,645
Speaker 2:  automatically take recorded audio and put it on your iPod.

247
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:10,205
Speaker 2:  The list at the time was brand new and iPod was an app started by

248
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:13,685
Speaker 2:  a guy named Adam Curry who had an audio blog of his own at the time called

249
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:17,525
Speaker 2:  Daily Source Code. Adam was a long time radio guy, he'd

250
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:21,485
Speaker 2:  also been an MTV VJ for years and he'd also been an early

251
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:25,525
Speaker 2:  internet entrepreneur and for years at this point he had been chatting with

252
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:29,285
Speaker 2:  Dave Weiner and others about the whole concept of putting audio files

253
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:33,085
Speaker 2:  in RSS. But Adam was one of the very first people to have

254
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:37,165
Speaker 2:  kind of a whole vision of how this on demand internet radio

255
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:38,605
Speaker 2:  thing should actually work.

256
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:40,845
Speaker 8:  Now it was end of 2003

257
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:45,925
Speaker 8:  when a friend of mine said Look at this cool thing I have I said What, do

258
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:49,485
Speaker 8:  you have? And it was the iPod and I looked at this iPod

259
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:53,965
Speaker 8:  and it was like literally like lightning bolts because

260
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:58,565
Speaker 8:  it looked I don't have any I, it looked exactly like this

261
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:02,605
Speaker 8:  transistor radio my grandmother had given me when I was seven years old.

262
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:06,285
Speaker 8:  This little, little Sony transistor radio nine volt battery.

263
00:17:06,865 --> 00:17:10,565
Speaker 8:  I'm like, yeah, you can call this a digital Walkman or you know,

264
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:14,405
Speaker 8:  whatever you want, but this to me was a radio receiver and right away I'm

265
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:18,285
Speaker 8:  like, oh, let's hook it up to this RSS thing. So

266
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:22,205
Speaker 8:  again with my very poor scripting skills. I

267
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:26,125
Speaker 8:  tried to rig this together with Apple Script and then Kevin Marks

268
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,805
Speaker 8:  who I think worked at I, dunno if he worked at Google, he worked in Silicon

269
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:32,645
Speaker 8:  Valley somewhere. He basically said, oh here's the script that you need and

270
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:36,565
Speaker 8:  boom, I was like, okay, it works. So I could create a blog post and then

271
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:40,325
Speaker 8:  this little script would be looking to to find some, a new item

272
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:44,085
Speaker 8:  in my blog post with a file attached to it. It would download the file,

273
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:47,165
Speaker 8:  it would, because you still had to sync your iPod back in the day

274
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:51,725
Speaker 8:  to your computer and So it would trigger an update and then in the morning

275
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:55,525
Speaker 8:  you'd walk in and There would be your iPod with as the album

276
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:59,245
Speaker 8:  would be. Basically, we didn't have the name podcasting yet. It would be,

277
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:03,325
Speaker 8:  you know, kind of the blog name or the, you know, the the show name and

278
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:07,285
Speaker 8:  then it would have these episodes under it and I immediately started to just

279
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:11,605
Speaker 8:  get the word out There because I needed software developers who could create

280
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:12,325
Speaker 8:  this for real

281
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:16,645
Speaker 2:  That thing he's describing. That script was iPod, it would watch

282
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:20,285
Speaker 2:  RSS feeds for audio files, it would download them, sync them to your iPod

283
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:23,365
Speaker 2:  and you're done. That's just a podcasting app, right?

284
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:27,605
Speaker 2:  Adam Curry made a podcasting app, that's all it was. And

285
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:31,325
Speaker 2:  in fact his show Daily Source Code was in part a podcast

286
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,805
Speaker 2:  for it was own sake, you know, entertainment and content and whatever, but

287
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:38,565
Speaker 2:  it was also in part sort of an ongoing beta test of how

288
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:42,405
Speaker 2:  all of this podcasting technology stuff might really work.

289
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:47,325
Speaker 8:  So, I'd like, okay, I have an audience. It's these guys and a

290
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:51,085
Speaker 8:  couple gals at the time who develop software. How do I

291
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:55,165
Speaker 8:  keep them engaged in this process? Well I need to give them content

292
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:59,365
Speaker 8:  every single day and it has to be about the stuff they're doing, which is

293
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,245
Speaker 8:  programming What do you do in programming, you create source

294
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:07,245
Speaker 8:  code So I did it every single day for a long time and from

295
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:10,805
Speaker 8:  I I missed one from time to time and it They came became more spaced out

296
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:14,765
Speaker 8:  over time. But we kept Daily source code and I would literally talk

297
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:18,485
Speaker 8:  about the developments They had done the previous day. So They needed something

298
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:22,285
Speaker 8:  to test on. There were no programs So, They needed something daily

299
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:26,365
Speaker 8:  that sounded like a, you know, a show that They could

300
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:30,285
Speaker 8:  use. So we could figure out well where did show notes go

301
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:34,445
Speaker 8:  And you know, when someone first subscribes to a feed, do you

302
00:19:34,595 --> 00:19:38,525
Speaker 8:  give them the most recent one? Do you download all of the archives, all of

303
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:42,365
Speaker 8:  this stuff and So I know from my radio background,

304
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:46,005
Speaker 8:  when you talk about people on the radio, it makes them feel good.

305
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:50,205
Speaker 8:  So, when I was talking about Andrew Grommet and you know the guys at

306
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:54,565
Speaker 8:  at iPod or X and you know one was in Australia and the other one was

307
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:56,485
Speaker 8:  in I, know somewhere in Vienna

308
00:19:58,075 --> 00:20:02,005
Speaker 8:  that motivates you and So it was both a feedback loop. 'cause I was

309
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:05,925
Speaker 8:  the ultimate user both from the content creation side and from the, from

310
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:06,765
Speaker 8:  the listener side.

311
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:11,045
Speaker 2:  So, you can hear this flywheel going at this point, the programmers are

312
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:13,965
Speaker 2:  making Podcasts, they're listening to each other's Podcasts. They're building

313
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:17,405
Speaker 2:  better software for listening and to and making those Podcasts. They're making

314
00:20:17,545 --> 00:20:21,365
Speaker 2:  new stuff to test it and round and round and round it goes. And

315
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:25,405
Speaker 2:  a lot of that conversation was happening on the iPod or dev email

316
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:29,205
Speaker 2:  list, which is where we come back to Danny roi. In

317
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:33,205
Speaker 2:  September of 2004 he wrote to the iPod or dev list that he could imagine

318
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:37,045
Speaker 2:  a world in which people would want to be able to subscribe to one of these

319
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:40,725
Speaker 2:  audio programs and get access to older stuff. He didn't know whether to

320
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:44,445
Speaker 2:  call that older stuff posts or episodes or shows. He actually

321
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:48,085
Speaker 2:  suggested calling them POS or sos, which I'm very glad

322
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:52,045
Speaker 2:  did not catch on. And he though They might want an easier way

323
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:55,965
Speaker 2:  to go through the archives, but then he wrote this I

324
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:59,605
Speaker 2:  guess one could argue that this is simply an RSS slash server side issue

325
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:03,405
Speaker 2:  and that the podcaster, yes, I like making up words, should be

326
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:07,205
Speaker 2:  responsible enough to offer a page of separate feeds of old SOS by month,

327
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:11,245
Speaker 2:  year, season, et cetera. He kind of made up Podcasts again

328
00:21:11,795 --> 00:21:15,565
Speaker 2:  Dave Weiner and others have over the years given Gregoire credit for

329
00:21:15,745 --> 00:21:18,925
Speaker 2:  if not making it up, at least making the term podcast a thing.

330
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:21,725
Speaker 2:  Adam Curry in particular is pretty forceful about it

331
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:25,885
Speaker 8:  And for my money, Danny Gregoire is the one who showed up with that,

332
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:29,965
Speaker 8:  with that name I know Ben Hammersley feels he

333
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:34,045
Speaker 8:  invented it. He used the word a long time before that, but I'd never

334
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:37,805
Speaker 8:  heard it. So Danny showed up with Podcasts. It made a lot of sense

335
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:41,645
Speaker 8:  because we were doing this on the, on the iPod and So.

336
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:43,205
Speaker 8:  it was obvious where it came from,

337
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:47,245
Speaker 2:  However it came into be Weiner and Curry both bought into the word

338
00:21:47,245 --> 00:21:51,165
Speaker 2:  immediately and did a lot of work promoting the word podcast once

339
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:55,125
Speaker 2:  it had been sort of unofficially decided on as usual. There is

340
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,725
Speaker 2:  no clear story about who did exactly What, who knew What when, where the

341
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:02,285
Speaker 2:  word came from. And if anyone is singularly responsible,

342
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:05,925
Speaker 2:  I don't know that it matters to be honest. But I do know this. After

343
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,885
Speaker 2:  Gregor's email to the iPod group, the word Podcast caught on

344
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:14,165
Speaker 2:  really fast I think the first podcast to ever refer to itself

345
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,645
Speaker 2:  as a Podcast was probably Dave Slusher on Evil Genius

346
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:21,005
Speaker 2:  Chronicles, which had been around in blog form for a couple of years and

347
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:24,885
Speaker 2:  was becoming an audio blog at the time. Three days after Gregor's

348
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:28,565
Speaker 2:  email in September of 2004. Like all good early

349
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:32,445
Speaker 2:  Podcasts Slusher spends a long time talking about how all this new

350
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:35,525
Speaker 2:  fangled technology works for making and downloading audio,

351
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:40,325
Speaker 2:  talking about his servers and Bit Torrance and Bills and all this

352
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,685
Speaker 2:  stuff. And then he talks about What, he calls it

353
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:48,085
Speaker 9:  And So I and I I saw somebody, there's

354
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:52,125
Speaker 9:  somebody has registered podcasting.net and I saw a

355
00:22:52,315 --> 00:22:55,645
Speaker 9:  podcaster or podcaster.net and I saw

356
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:59,645
Speaker 9:  podcaster as a user agent, you know, hitting my RSS feed and I went and looked

357
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:02,805
Speaker 9:  at it and right now it's just a coming soon page, but I'm gonna pay attention

358
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:06,645
Speaker 9:  to that I wanna see who's, who's got that and What they're doing but that

359
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:10,485
Speaker 9:  term I think they've coined the term So iPod platform just doesn't,

360
00:23:10,485 --> 00:23:13,805
Speaker 9:  you know, spring from the tongue Tongue but What I'm doing right here and

361
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:17,045
Speaker 9:  What Adam's doing and What Dave Weiner's doing and What it conversations

362
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:20,565
Speaker 9:  are doing. That's podcasting. I think that is the term

363
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:25,125
Speaker 9:  I am using that from here on out. You know So, I am a podcaster

364
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:29,285
Speaker 9:  and They are podcasters and I am podcasting right now and you listen

365
00:23:29,345 --> 00:23:31,805
Speaker 9:  to my podcast fucking A

366
00:23:32,555 --> 00:23:36,425
Speaker 2:  Think about how quickly that changed A few months after Ben

367
00:23:36,425 --> 00:23:40,065
Speaker 2:  Hammersley haphazardly wrote the word in a story a few days after

368
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:43,305
Speaker 2:  Danny Gregoire brought it up to that super influential mailing list,

369
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:47,685
Speaker 2:  Podcasts were being called Podcasts. One really

370
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:51,645
Speaker 2:  fun thing about listening to some of the Podcasts from this era is hearing

371
00:23:51,735 --> 00:23:55,445
Speaker 2:  these Podcast hosts actually reckon with the idea of being

372
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:59,525
Speaker 2:  Podcast hosts. Like here's a clip from a show called the Dawn and

373
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:03,405
Speaker 2:  Drew show also from September of 2004. This is their very first episode

374
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:06,645
Speaker 2:  and you can hear them kind of trying on the term for size.

375
00:24:07,035 --> 00:24:07,805
Speaker 10:  Alright, now

376
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:09,845
Speaker 11:  Wait, What is podcasting.

377
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,125
Speaker 10:  We're we're broadcasting to pod devices, which

378
00:24:14,265 --> 00:24:17,325
Speaker 10:  what's a pod? An iPod would be We don't have an MP three player,

379
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:19,085
Speaker 11:  But We don't have an iPod. Well that's why

380
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:22,645
Speaker 10:  We're pod it's been the term has been coined

381
00:24:23,185 --> 00:24:23,405
Speaker 10:  and

382
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:27,845
Speaker 11:  Is someone gonna give us one for free I Wish? Dear

383
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:31,805
Speaker 11:  in Nut, please give me a pod me a because

384
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:35,365
Speaker 11:  Drew has like a little machine, this little tiny thing that he puts music

385
00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:37,525
Speaker 11:  in and I don't have one, it's a

386
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:41,445
Speaker 10:  Lira from RCA, but see now that would technically be considered a pod

387
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:43,085
Speaker 10:  in this regard.

388
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:47,885
Speaker 11:  I think we should crawl inside a pod to do this. I

389
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:49,885
Speaker 11:  have some right here, let me unzip it.

390
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:53,925
Speaker 11:  Get out of my pod. Oh shit, there's someone one in There

391
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:59,085
Speaker 2:  At this moment. It has still only been a few days since the word Podcast

392
00:24:59,345 --> 00:25:03,205
Speaker 2:  hit that mailing list and already it's just the accepted term. They're

393
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:07,125
Speaker 2:  broadcasting to pod devices, they're Podcasts. That is how quickly it happened.

394
00:25:07,385 --> 00:25:11,045
Speaker 2:  And now for better or for worse, 20 years later there's still Podcasts.

395
00:25:12,315 --> 00:25:13,125
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta

396
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:46,205
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. All right, we've talked a lot about the history of

397
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:49,645
Speaker 2:  Podcasts. Let's talk a little bit about the future and kind of where We are

398
00:26:49,665 --> 00:26:53,365
Speaker 2:  now as a way to understand where We might be going 20 years after

399
00:26:53,565 --> 00:26:57,485
Speaker 2:  a podcast became a podcast. Podcasts are bigger than ever, right? Like the

400
00:26:57,485 --> 00:27:00,845
Speaker 2:  Podcast Revolution kind of worked. There are people out doing amazing things.

401
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:04,765
Speaker 2:  There are whole companies being built around Podcasts. More people are listening

402
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:08,605
Speaker 2:  to Podcasts than ever, but podcasting hasn't killed radio.

403
00:27:09,065 --> 00:27:13,005
Speaker 2:  It hasn't become the future of the media

404
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:16,485
Speaker 2:  business or democracy or whatever high-minded stuff those folks were talking

405
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:19,805
Speaker 2:  about 20 years ago. It's doing really cool work,

406
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:24,485
Speaker 2:  but how important are Podcasts and how big is this

407
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:28,085
Speaker 2:  industry going to be and how is it supposed to work even after two decades?

408
00:27:28,305 --> 00:27:32,245
Speaker 2:  So, much of that stuff feels like it hasn't been ironed out yet. So

409
00:27:32,245 --> 00:27:35,325
Speaker 2:  to help me figure out where we are and where we're headed with all of this

410
00:27:35,325 --> 00:27:38,805
Speaker 2:  stuff, I invited James k Credlin from podcast News net

411
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:43,085
Speaker 2:  back on the show to talk about it. I mentioned James up top. He did a great

412
00:27:43,135 --> 00:27:47,045
Speaker 2:  piece a while back about The history of the word podcast that I got

413
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:50,525
Speaker 2:  a lot of really great information from. He's also been in and covering the

414
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:54,325
Speaker 2:  podcast industry for longer than almost anybody and knows this

415
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:58,285
Speaker 2:  space incredibly well. He's super fun to talk to. So I figured I would

416
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:01,805
Speaker 2:  just sit here and throw some of my questions slash

417
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:05,605
Speaker 2:  existential crises about the future of my Life and career and all of my favorite

418
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:09,445
Speaker 2:  Podcasts at him and see if together we might be able to figure

419
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:13,045
Speaker 2:  out where all of this audio blogging stuff is headed next.

420
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:17,285
Speaker 2:  Let's get into it. I think if we had had this conversation a year ago,

421
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:21,405
Speaker 2:  it was like doom and gloom everywhere. The, yeah, the the golden age of

422
00:28:21,405 --> 00:28:25,165
Speaker 2:  podcasting is over. Everything is a disaster. You know,

423
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:28,565
Speaker 2:  this was all fun while it lasted. Goodbye to everybody. It feels like we're

424
00:28:28,565 --> 00:28:32,365
Speaker 2:  in a slightly different place in the podcasting universe. Like at the risk

425
00:28:32,365 --> 00:28:34,965
Speaker 2:  of asking a needlessly broad question here, right at the beginning, where

426
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:36,325
Speaker 2:  do you feel like we are right now?

427
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:41,325
Speaker 12:  I think we're in a pretty good position. I think What

428
00:28:42,005 --> 00:28:45,445
Speaker 12:  happened between probably 2019 and

429
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:49,085
Speaker 12:  2022 was that a lot of new money came into the

430
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:53,045
Speaker 12:  podcasting world. it was new money that was really destined for TV

431
00:28:54,105 --> 00:28:58,085
Speaker 12:  and instead was diverted into the podcasting, you know,

432
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:02,005
Speaker 12:  existence. And really that was their I,

433
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:06,165
Speaker 12:  I think a lot of TV execs got into podcasting because They felt that

434
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:09,645
Speaker 12:  it was an easy win for them. And I think that They didn't properly

435
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:13,525
Speaker 12:  understand anything about audio and anything about

436
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:17,285
Speaker 12:  making great shows because

437
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:21,285
Speaker 12:  it's very different world to tv. Audio is a very

438
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:25,205
Speaker 12:  habitual thing. You listen to a particular show which you'll listen to every

439
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:29,005
Speaker 12:  single week. So Limited series shows by and

440
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:32,885
Speaker 12:  large don't work too well. So I think that we saw a lot of people

441
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:37,045
Speaker 12:  who were, you know, who were coming at this with a different media understanding

442
00:29:37,105 --> 00:29:40,885
Speaker 12:  of how TV works trying to apply it to the podcasting world and

443
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:44,685
Speaker 12:  they're not really understanding why it wasn't actually working. And that's

444
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:48,525
Speaker 12:  really, What stopped happening at the end of 2022, beginning of 2023

445
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:52,525
Speaker 12:  and why we all of a sudden saw lots of layoffs and lots of,

446
00:29:52,545 --> 00:29:56,285
Speaker 12:  you know, bad things happening. Coinciding of course with

447
00:29:57,205 --> 00:30:00,485
Speaker 12:  whatever's going on in the media industry as a whole. Anyway,

448
00:30:00,855 --> 00:30:01,205
Speaker 12:  right?

449
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:05,385
Speaker 2:  So does it feel like to a certain extent we're, we're

450
00:30:05,895 --> 00:30:09,425
Speaker 2:  back to where we were with Podcasts I Don't know

451
00:30:10,135 --> 00:30:12,785
Speaker 2:  Pres Serial, like There There was a moment where it was like serial happened

452
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:15,545
Speaker 2:  and then it was like, okay, podcast is gonna go through it. wasn it was peak

453
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:19,585
Speaker 2:  TV era and maybe 10 years later we're at the end of the

454
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:22,705
Speaker 2:  peak TV era in the way that in the TV world we're at the end of the peak

455
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:26,505
Speaker 2:  TV era. And we're gonna go back to I don't know the, the like

456
00:30:27,215 --> 00:30:30,985
Speaker 2:  sitcoms and reality TV version of the

457
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:31,865
Speaker 2:  podcasting universe.

458
00:30:32,495 --> 00:30:36,225
Speaker 12:  Well, So I think, you know, podcasting has always had two

459
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:40,745
Speaker 12:  kind of separate industries. You've got the industry

460
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:44,905
Speaker 12:  of, you know, the serials of this world, big high

461
00:30:44,905 --> 00:30:48,865
Speaker 12:  budget shows with a lot of people working on them and

462
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:53,065
Speaker 12:  you know, that has been always a part of podcasting and then

463
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:56,985
Speaker 12:  you've had, you know, a show which is put together by, you

464
00:30:56,985 --> 00:31:00,345
Speaker 12:  know, two people and a computer program and that's it.

465
00:31:01,045 --> 00:31:04,665
Speaker 12:  And those shows seem to have weathered the storm

466
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:07,825
Speaker 12:  obviously, because the costs for making those shows are much, much lower.

467
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:11,785
Speaker 12:  But those shows are typically around sort of I would say

468
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:16,745
Speaker 12:  18 90% of all shows out There are things that

469
00:31:16,745 --> 00:31:20,505
Speaker 12:  are put together, you know, at relatively low cost.

470
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:24,625
Speaker 12:  It isn't a massive staffing thing of, you know, 20 people involved in

471
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:28,145
Speaker 12:  one particular show as some of these shows are. And I think

472
00:31:28,195 --> 00:31:31,945
Speaker 12:  podcasting is always done very well because of that. Because it

473
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:36,105
Speaker 12:  is a, because it's an open medium that anybody can

474
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:40,105
Speaker 12:  actually get into. I think that's been the real benefit. So

475
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:44,145
Speaker 12:  So, I think, yeah, There have been ebbs and flows in terms of that top

476
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:48,585
Speaker 12:  10% in terms of the revenue coming in from advertising,

477
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:52,425
Speaker 12:  but I don't think podcasting itself has changed that much

478
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:54,305
Speaker 12:  to be honest in the last 20 years.

479
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:57,385
Speaker 2:  Ooh, okay. So, that brings me to one of the things I was gonna ask you, which

480
00:31:57,385 --> 00:32:01,305
Speaker 2:  is a question you asked a Spotify executive very recently that I really liked

481
00:32:01,405 --> 00:32:05,145
Speaker 2:  and want to hear your answer to, which is What is a podcast in 2024.

482
00:32:05,145 --> 00:32:08,305
Speaker 2:  Yeah, thanks. Because I think you could argue it is both the same and

483
00:32:08,495 --> 00:32:12,185
Speaker 2:  diametrically different than What it was 20 years ago. So What, how would

484
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:13,145
Speaker 2:  you define What? It is now

485
00:32:13,685 --> 00:32:17,225
Speaker 12:  So, I think a Podcast. The the easy answer is a podcast

486
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:21,345
Speaker 12:  is anything that the audience thinks it is. Whatever the

487
00:32:21,545 --> 00:32:23,065
Speaker 12:  audience wants to claim is a podcast

488
00:32:23,495 --> 00:32:25,945
Speaker 2:  That feels like cheating. I don't like that answer. Yeah,

489
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:29,705
Speaker 12:  I and, and it's a, and it's a cheat answer because I don't think it

490
00:32:29,705 --> 00:32:33,385
Speaker 12:  necessarily understands What. The benefit of a Podcast is,

491
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:37,545
Speaker 12:  but If, you ask somebody whether they're watching a podcast on YouTube,

492
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:40,885
Speaker 12:  what's the difference between a podcast and another YouTube video

493
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:45,165
Speaker 12:  then typically you will get the answer. You can see the microphones in a

494
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:48,725
Speaker 12:  podcast, which is a really weird, weird answer. Yeah,

495
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:53,405
Speaker 12:  but I think, you know from a, you know, overarching

496
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:57,325
Speaker 12:  thing of What is a Podcast I think that a podcast is a piece of on demand

497
00:32:57,695 --> 00:33:01,565
Speaker 12:  audio first content that's basically all, all that

498
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:05,365
Speaker 12:  it is now There is, There are a lot of people who will turn around and say

499
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:09,925
Speaker 12:  RSS is massively important and enclosures are important and all of

500
00:33:09,925 --> 00:33:13,885
Speaker 12:  the technical detail that makes a Podcast a podcast. I'm not So sure

501
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:17,485
Speaker 12:  that that's as important as We think it is and actually

502
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:20,925
Speaker 12:  at the end of the day, it's whatever somebody thinks a podcast is.

503
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:25,125
Speaker 2:  Okay, let me just press on that slightly. You're a person

504
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:28,765
Speaker 2:  who covers Podcasts So, you have to draw a line somewhere.

505
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,885
Speaker 2:  Where is that line for you?

506
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:35,815
Speaker 12:  Well, So, the Podcasts that I write about are

507
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:38,895
Speaker 12:  Podcasts that are open, that are available on,

508
00:33:39,795 --> 00:33:43,015
Speaker 12:  on every single platform and available, you know,

509
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:46,575
Speaker 12:  in, you know that phrase, wherever you get your Podcast

510
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:51,335
Speaker 12:  is an important thing because that to me is What. A Podcast

511
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:55,415
Speaker 12:  is So. If a podcast is only available on Audible, I typically won't, won't

512
00:33:55,415 --> 00:33:58,975
Speaker 12:  write about it because it's not I. I don't think a a podcast

513
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:03,975
Speaker 12:  similarly, if it's only available on Wondery Plus or on the BBC sounds

514
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:07,055
Speaker 12:  app or whatever it might be, So, that's where I

515
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:11,615
Speaker 12:  draw the line. But I think you know, it it it

516
00:34:11,615 --> 00:34:15,575
Speaker 12:  all differs If you If you ask people, you know What What,

517
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:19,495
Speaker 12:  their most favorite podcast app is, there's a lot of people that answer

518
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:23,415
Speaker 12:  YouTube even though YouTube doesn't satisfy any

519
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:27,615
Speaker 12:  of the technical elements of What. A podcast is an audio file

520
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:30,655
Speaker 12:  in an MP three without DRM available to download

521
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:35,415
Speaker 12:  via RSS with an enclosure. All of that stuff YouTube does

522
00:34:35,445 --> 00:34:39,415
Speaker 12:  none of yet I think it's perfectly acceptable

523
00:34:39,435 --> 00:34:42,375
Speaker 12:  to say that you can listen to a podcast on YouTube.

524
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:46,895
Speaker 2:  Speaking of things that had a moment and feel like they're fading, this

525
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:50,655
Speaker 2:  idea of the non-Open

526
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:54,775
Speaker 2:  podcast feels like it has started to go

527
00:34:54,775 --> 00:34:58,015
Speaker 2:  away. There were a few years There where There was a real sense that a bunch

528
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:01,735
Speaker 2:  of companies, Spotify and Audible and Sirius and whoever else were going

529
00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:05,535
Speaker 2:  to sort of build themselves a library of exclusive

530
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:08,895
Speaker 2:  audio products and would use that

531
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:13,695
Speaker 2:  to win in some large way. Wondery you

532
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:17,535
Speaker 2:  mentioned has been pushing towards that. That idea seems

533
00:35:17,535 --> 00:35:21,015
Speaker 2:  to have, if not disappeared then at least gone away and There are a lot of

534
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:23,815
Speaker 2:  folks doing, you know, the advertising and distribution deals, but the idea

535
00:35:23,815 --> 00:35:26,975
Speaker 2:  of like the platform exclusive podcast

536
00:35:28,065 --> 00:35:31,895
Speaker 2:  seems like it is fading. Do you think that that era is

537
00:35:31,925 --> 00:35:35,815
Speaker 2:  just behind us and that openness in a certain way is, is going to

538
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:36,775
Speaker 2:  win going forward here?

539
00:35:37,395 --> 00:35:40,885
Speaker 12:  Yeah, I mean I, I, I would hope, put it that way. I would hope

540
00:35:41,115 --> 00:35:44,965
Speaker 12:  that exclusivity is going away. I mean Daniel Ek was

541
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:48,885
Speaker 12:  very clear I I in earlier on in this year when he

542
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:52,565
Speaker 12:  was doing his earnings call. He, he, he was saying that some of those

543
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:56,365
Speaker 12:  exclusivity deals worked, but generally it wasn't aligned

544
00:35:56,395 --> 00:36:00,245
Speaker 12:  with What the creator wanted. My understanding, for example, is that

545
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:03,605
Speaker 12:  There was a, There was a big author who

546
00:36:04,265 --> 00:36:07,725
Speaker 12:  she put her show as an exclusive onto Spotify

547
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:12,365
Speaker 12:  and she saw that the amount of books that she was selling went down

548
00:36:12,475 --> 00:36:16,445
Speaker 12:  because the amount of people who were listening to her show went

549
00:36:16,445 --> 00:36:20,325
Speaker 12:  down because it was an exclusive and only available on one thing. So, you

550
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:23,165
Speaker 12:  know, So clearly, you know, If, you want both

551
00:36:24,745 --> 00:36:28,685
Speaker 12:  If, you want, you know, both large audiences but also

552
00:36:28,745 --> 00:36:32,605
Speaker 12:  you want to be able to get your ideas out There and have

553
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:36,405
Speaker 12:  influence. Then exclusivity doesn't necessarily work too

554
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:40,205
Speaker 12:  well. We are seeing a few hold ons in terms of exclusivity. I mean

555
00:36:40,205 --> 00:36:44,125
Speaker 12:  some of the, the large broadcasters in the world

556
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:47,725
Speaker 12:  seem to be pulling, you know, some of their shows into exclusives

557
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:52,325
Speaker 12:  on their own apps and the BBC is doing a little bit more of that, which

558
00:36:52,405 --> 00:36:56,125
Speaker 12:  I kind of wish that They wouldn't. and we are still seeing a few

559
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:59,965
Speaker 12:  sort of windowing type of things where you can hear a show

560
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:03,725
Speaker 12:  first on a particular, you know, exclusive platform,

561
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:07,205
Speaker 12:  Wondery Plus being a good example, but I think that those are

562
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:11,365
Speaker 12:  relatively few and far between and I think that people

563
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:15,645
Speaker 12:  now understand that reach and influence is just

564
00:37:15,665 --> 00:37:19,325
Speaker 12:  as important as, you know, as as trying to build

565
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:23,325
Speaker 12:  a particular app that doesn't NN necessarily work too well.

566
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:27,285
Speaker 2:  Why do you think that is I think it's So different than the way

567
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:31,405
Speaker 2:  that streaming TV and movies has shaken out? Yeah, and I think again, the

568
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:35,325
Speaker 2:  bet five years ago was that the podcast world would Look a lot like

569
00:37:35,325 --> 00:37:39,245
Speaker 2:  the TV world in that it would be a bunch of competitive platforms all competing

570
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:42,085
Speaker 2:  on their libraries, right? Why do you think Podcasts didn't go that way?

571
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:47,065
Speaker 12:  Yeah, and, and There was luminary for example, which tries to

572
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:50,785
Speaker 12:  right I think it was one of the first companies that was trying to do all

573
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:54,745
Speaker 12:  of this. And interestingly, I mean There are still quite a few large companies

574
00:37:54,845 --> 00:37:58,705
Speaker 12:  in Europe which have a big exclusive, you know, amount

575
00:37:58,705 --> 00:38:02,665
Speaker 12:  of of shows as well. But I think, you know, at the end of the day it

576
00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:06,385
Speaker 12:  doesn't necessarily work because we are used to the status quo

577
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:09,345
Speaker 12:  of having all of our Podcasts available in one place.

578
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:13,745
Speaker 12:  And you know, I mean way back in time when I was

579
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:17,825
Speaker 12:  working in a radio station and looking at radio

580
00:38:18,055 --> 00:38:21,625
Speaker 12:  apps, I used to always say to people that a radio

581
00:38:21,845 --> 00:38:25,665
Speaker 12:  app was downloaded by your fans, your p

582
00:38:25,665 --> 00:38:29,545
Speaker 12:  one listeners in Radio World. You know, you, you wouldn't necessarily

583
00:38:29,605 --> 00:38:33,345
Speaker 12:  get people downloading an app just in case There was something worthwhile,

584
00:38:33,985 --> 00:38:37,925
Speaker 12:  you know, tuning into on it. And I think that podcasting is exactly the,

585
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:41,965
Speaker 12:  the same way So, there's no doubt for example, that

586
00:38:41,965 --> 00:38:45,685
Speaker 12:  Joe Rogan moving as an exclusive to Spotify helped

587
00:38:45,795 --> 00:38:49,485
Speaker 12:  grow the amount of installs to Spotify, but Joe Rogan is

588
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:53,445
Speaker 12:  I think different to most shows and I, think If, you were to

589
00:38:53,705 --> 00:38:57,325
Speaker 12:  say that about pretty well any other show that Spotify had,

590
00:38:57,785 --> 00:39:01,205
Speaker 12:  I'm not sure that you would see a massive increase in the amount of

591
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:05,325
Speaker 12:  installs of that app just because a podcast happened to be on it.

592
00:39:05,455 --> 00:39:09,365
Speaker 12:  There are, you know, 3 million shows out, There, if

593
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:13,365
Speaker 12:  one of the shows isn't available on your chosen app, then guess What.

594
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:17,205
Speaker 12:  There's another, there's another 3 million for you to go and and and

595
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:21,045
Speaker 12:  have a listen to So I think from that point of view, the exclusive should

596
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:24,805
Speaker 12:  hopefully have gone. It wasn't good for anybody really, but as you

597
00:39:24,825 --> 00:39:28,325
Speaker 12:  say, it was exactly the point that TV

598
00:39:28,335 --> 00:39:32,045
Speaker 12:  executives, you know, looking at Hulu, looking at Max,

599
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:35,725
Speaker 12:  looking at all of these weird and wonderful things though, well that

600
00:39:35,755 --> 00:39:39,565
Speaker 12:  will work in the audio world and, and I think, you know,

601
00:39:39,575 --> 00:39:43,165
Speaker 12:  again, that was one of the, the mistakes made during the big

602
00:39:43,165 --> 00:39:45,725
Speaker 12:  excitement of 2019 to 2022

603
00:39:46,465 --> 00:39:49,485
Speaker 2:  And What about YouTube. I think YouTube is

604
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:54,085
Speaker 2:  in a lot of ways not a platform for Podcasts and also

605
00:39:54,315 --> 00:39:57,525
Speaker 2:  kind of by far the most interesting platform for Podcasts and

606
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:01,085
Speaker 2:  as a, as a person who makes Podcasts I have an awfully hard time

607
00:40:01,605 --> 00:40:05,485
Speaker 2:  thinking about how I should think about YouTube. Yes, What is your sense

608
00:40:05,485 --> 00:40:09,445
Speaker 2:  of of What YouTube means to the podcast industry, especially kind of over

609
00:40:09,445 --> 00:40:10,085
Speaker 2:  the next few years.

610
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:15,125
Speaker 12:  I think YouTube is fascinating. I think that There is There are

611
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:18,725
Speaker 12:  a couple of things going on. Firstly, a as we have

612
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:22,165
Speaker 12:  established people don't really know What a Podcast is and So therefore

613
00:40:22,165 --> 00:40:26,005
Speaker 12:  If, you ask the general public where do you listen to your podcasts?

614
00:40:26,335 --> 00:40:30,285
Speaker 12:  Quite a lot of them will say YouTube, but YouTube So far as

615
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:34,085
Speaker 12:  I can see is not delivering the amount of plays,

616
00:40:34,185 --> 00:40:38,045
Speaker 12:  the amount of listens to most shows than you would expect

617
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:42,085
Speaker 12:  from a very large, you know, platform for a podcast.

618
00:40:42,145 --> 00:40:46,005
Speaker 12:  Listen, it seems to be delivering an

619
00:40:46,005 --> 00:40:49,845
Speaker 12:  incremental amount of plays and downloads to a show,

620
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:54,365
Speaker 12:  but it isn't the number one place where people are going to have

621
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:58,085
Speaker 12:  a listen to a particular podcast that said I think What

622
00:40:58,085 --> 00:41:01,765
Speaker 12:  YouTube has is it's clearly got a lot of people who use it

623
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:06,365
Speaker 12:  every day, I, I pay for it and I use it, you know, pretty well

624
00:41:06,365 --> 00:41:10,045
Speaker 12:  every single day the algorithm is very good at surfacing new

625
00:41:10,045 --> 00:41:14,005
Speaker 12:  content that I might want to go and have a listen to and that's a fantastic

626
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:18,245
Speaker 12:  opportunity for the podcasting world.

627
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:22,365
Speaker 12:  We are always told, aren't we that Podcast discovery, you know,

628
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:26,405
Speaker 12:  it's a real problem and blah blah blah. I'm not necessarily sure that it

629
00:41:26,405 --> 00:41:30,245
Speaker 12:  is, but certainly YouTube and YouTube's algorithm can actually help

630
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:34,205
Speaker 12:  fix all of that. So I think that that's one sort of side of it. I also think

631
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:37,685
Speaker 12:  from the creator's side, They Look at some of the big

632
00:41:37,715 --> 00:41:40,285
Speaker 12:  YouTubers and They go, wow, I can get some of this money.

633
00:41:41,745 --> 00:41:45,725
Speaker 12:  You know, it's, it, it's a way of earning me cash and perhaps

634
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:49,245
Speaker 12:  this is the right way of earning money out of the show that I do,

635
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:53,205
Speaker 12:  but I also think that it's putting an awful lot of creators off

636
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:57,085
Speaker 12:  because all of a sudden we have to talk about cameras

637
00:41:57,465 --> 00:42:01,445
Speaker 12:  and lighting and we have to talk about video editing, which is

638
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:05,365
Speaker 12:  way more complicated than audio editing, which is why

639
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:09,285
Speaker 12:  my definition of the word podcast starts with audio first. It's

640
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:13,245
Speaker 12:  something that you can enjoy with your ears

641
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:17,165
Speaker 12:  while your eyes are busy. That that's, that's the benefit of

642
00:42:17,205 --> 00:42:20,965
Speaker 12:  a podcast and So YouTube on that I I find it

643
00:42:21,245 --> 00:42:24,605
Speaker 12:  absolutely fascinating to watch What is going to happen with that particular

644
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:28,485
Speaker 12:  platform, but I think it's still very much, you know,

645
00:42:28,815 --> 00:42:32,725
Speaker 12:  let's wait and see What YouTube actually offers I mean,

646
00:42:32,865 --> 00:42:36,765
Speaker 12:  you know, it's, it's a Google thing So, therefore Google will probably

647
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:39,165
Speaker 12:  lose interest in about 18 months. I would've though

648
00:42:40,285 --> 00:42:42,925
Speaker 2:  Historically speaking we're, we're I would say over time on some of the,

649
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:46,485
Speaker 2:  some of those things by now, yeah, YouTube music not exactly

650
00:42:47,255 --> 00:42:51,245
Speaker 2:  innovating at all speeds right now, but no I I think you're right I think

651
00:42:51,245 --> 00:42:55,005
Speaker 2:  the a again to the kind of What is a podcast question. Audio first is,

652
00:42:55,025 --> 00:42:58,965
Speaker 2:  is a good one and I think yet another place where the line is really

653
00:42:59,145 --> 00:43:03,005
Speaker 2:  blurry, right? I, think about I. I hear people all the time who talk about

654
00:43:03,155 --> 00:43:06,925
Speaker 2:  getting YouTube premium just So. You can listen to videos in the

655
00:43:06,925 --> 00:43:10,605
Speaker 2:  background and They just listen to videos. Yeah, They like What is a good

656
00:43:10,995 --> 00:43:14,685
Speaker 2:  YouTube essay if not a podcast episode, right? Yeah. Like,

657
00:43:14,985 --> 00:43:18,805
Speaker 2:  and There was a YouTube TV announcement the other day that you can now

658
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:22,125
Speaker 2:  listen to TV in the background with your screen off and it's like,

659
00:43:22,665 --> 00:43:26,645
Speaker 2:  did They just turn every TV show on earth into a podcast like

660
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:30,325
Speaker 2:  maybe I don't know all these, all these lines are So blurry and So and So

661
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:34,445
Speaker 2:  interesting, but I I do think the video piece of it is,

662
00:43:34,665 --> 00:43:38,605
Speaker 2:  is important and complicated for both of the reasons you just said. One is

663
00:43:38,605 --> 00:43:42,525
Speaker 2:  that I think the thing that you YouTube has going forward is it is the

664
00:43:42,645 --> 00:43:45,685
Speaker 2:  best content discovery engine on the internet

665
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:50,325
Speaker 2:  and it Podcasts are hard to find. It's, it's hard to, to find a new

666
00:43:50,325 --> 00:43:53,845
Speaker 2:  podcast, it's hard to get into a new Podcast. Like the, the bar There is

667
00:43:53,845 --> 00:43:57,645
Speaker 2:  very high and YouTube is very good at that, but it also me it, it also

668
00:43:57,645 --> 00:44:00,605
Speaker 2:  requires video, right? Like We, we've had this experience and we've seen

669
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:04,325
Speaker 2:  at other places that If you do the thing that it's just like the the audiogram

670
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:07,805
Speaker 2:  on YouTube, it doesn't work nearly as well as If. you have video like the

671
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:11,445
Speaker 2:  algorithm likes video because YouTube is a video platform and So, we hear

672
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:15,005
Speaker 2:  this from creators all the time who are feeling somewhat forced

673
00:44:15,315 --> 00:44:18,325
Speaker 2:  into becoming, if not video first, then sort of

674
00:44:19,095 --> 00:44:23,005
Speaker 2:  video level shows. Yeah and it's changing

675
00:44:23,385 --> 00:44:26,005
Speaker 2:  the things that people make because suddenly when you're on camera you start

676
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:28,845
Speaker 2:  thinking differently about the whole thing that you're making and you can

677
00:44:28,845 --> 00:44:32,835
Speaker 2:  make different kinds of stuff. But it does feel like for

678
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:35,795
Speaker 2:  better and worse just because of like the way the business of all of this

679
00:44:35,795 --> 00:44:39,635
Speaker 2:  works and how you find people video is not going,

680
00:44:40,255 --> 00:44:43,755
Speaker 2:  it is more and more attached to the idea of What a podcast is than ever.

681
00:44:43,895 --> 00:44:44,835
Speaker 2:  I'm curious If, you agree with that?

682
00:44:45,105 --> 00:44:48,915
Speaker 12:  Yeah. I, I, I I mean you mentioned Serial earlier on, would

683
00:44:48,915 --> 00:44:52,875
Speaker 12:  Serial have existed as a podcast if They had to

684
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:53,395
Speaker 12:  make video?

685
00:44:54,385 --> 00:44:54,605
Speaker 2:  No.

686
00:44:54,765 --> 00:44:56,445
Speaker 12:  I, I, I I would probably argue no,

687
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:59,205
Speaker 2:  You just couldn't do it. I mean They were making that show week to week as

688
00:44:59,205 --> 00:45:02,405
Speaker 2:  They were doing it. You can't make a Netflix show like that. Yeah, that's

689
00:45:02,405 --> 00:45:02,765
Speaker 2:  not how that works.

690
00:45:03,235 --> 00:45:06,845
Speaker 12:  Yeah, exactly. So I, think I think that There are certain things that you,

691
00:45:08,545 --> 00:45:12,485
Speaker 12:  you know, a chat cast or a chum cast or whatever, whatever you

692
00:45:12,485 --> 00:45:16,405
Speaker 12:  want to call an interview podcast that is relatively easy

693
00:45:16,545 --> 00:45:20,405
Speaker 12:  to slap a couple of cameras on and hey Presto, you've got

694
00:45:20,515 --> 00:45:24,405
Speaker 12:  some video There, it becomes much harder. If, you want

695
00:45:24,405 --> 00:45:28,365
Speaker 12:  to produce something a bit better and I think that's the

696
00:45:28,365 --> 00:45:31,365
Speaker 12:  thing which is scaring creators away

697
00:45:32,045 --> 00:45:35,525
Speaker 12:  because all of a sudden They don't want, you know, quite a lot of us went

698
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:39,045
Speaker 12:  into the audio industry because you can do amazing things with audio.

699
00:45:39,505 --> 00:45:43,205
Speaker 12:  You can paint incredible pictures just using

700
00:45:43,655 --> 00:45:47,525
Speaker 12:  audio, not having to worry about What. The video actually

701
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:51,045
Speaker 12:  works and in fact the pictures are better with audio in many ways because

702
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:54,765
Speaker 12:  you are tapping into people's imagination

703
00:45:55,145 --> 00:45:59,005
Speaker 12:  and you know, I'm I might Look If, you don't know What, I Look like

704
00:45:59,205 --> 00:46:02,325
Speaker 12:  I might Look completely different to one person in their mind's eye too.

705
00:46:02,325 --> 00:46:06,285
Speaker 12:  Someone else. That's an amazing thing that audio can do. That

706
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:10,005
Speaker 12:  video can't and it worries me slightly that we are having

707
00:46:10,005 --> 00:46:13,805
Speaker 12:  people who are being put off the whole podcast world because

708
00:46:14,595 --> 00:46:18,045
Speaker 12:  They have to think about the video side and it's not just YouTube doing

709
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:21,845
Speaker 12:  this. Of course Spotify's big, big, big push right now is video.

710
00:46:22,695 --> 00:46:26,405
Speaker 12:  Video is still exclusive on Spotify's platform.

711
00:46:26,505 --> 00:46:30,245
Speaker 12:  So Spotify certainly isn't sharing that out. Even though you can do video

712
00:46:30,345 --> 00:46:34,285
Speaker 12:  in a podcast RSS Feed If, you want to, that is most

713
00:46:34,285 --> 00:46:38,165
Speaker 12:  definitely still an exclusive on their side. But it is interesting

714
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:41,845
Speaker 12:  seeing some of the data that's coming out of Spotify and seeing

715
00:46:41,915 --> 00:46:45,485
Speaker 12:  that, for example, people are just listening to the audio

716
00:46:45,545 --> 00:46:49,325
Speaker 12:  during the day but in the evening They might watch the

717
00:46:49,325 --> 00:46:49,565
Speaker 12:  video

718
00:46:51,165 --> 00:46:53,725
Speaker 12:  I think that There, there's some really interesting things There around

719
00:46:53,785 --> 00:46:57,525
Speaker 12:  how people are consuming content and the different ways

720
00:46:57,525 --> 00:47:00,605
Speaker 12:  that people consume content and video is not always right.

721
00:47:01,355 --> 00:47:04,685
Speaker 2:  Well like when I talk to audio people, people who like deeply believe in

722
00:47:04,685 --> 00:47:07,165
Speaker 2:  you know, public radio and audio been doing this for a long time, the thing

723
00:47:07,165 --> 00:47:09,965
Speaker 2:  they're worried about is that video just eventually eats all of this because

724
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:14,325
Speaker 2:  it's easier to monetize. But then There are a lot of

725
00:47:14,955 --> 00:47:18,085
Speaker 2:  cool things you can do in audio and cool things you can do with both. Like

726
00:47:18,885 --> 00:47:22,445
Speaker 2:  I is, is it a better world when these two things kind of exist

727
00:47:22,685 --> 00:47:26,045
Speaker 2:  separately or is is sort of smushing all of these things together on the

728
00:47:26,205 --> 00:47:27,445
Speaker 2:  internet gonna lead to good stuff.

729
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:31,485
Speaker 12:  Yeah, I mean I w I was reflecting the other day that everything now that

730
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:35,125
Speaker 12:  we listen to audio on has a

731
00:47:35,755 --> 00:47:39,485
Speaker 12:  full quality color screen. That never used to be the case

732
00:47:39,705 --> 00:47:42,605
Speaker 12:  but it, but it is now the case that you know, literally everything that

733
00:47:42,605 --> 00:47:45,885
Speaker 12:  you have, you have that beautiful color screen What are you gonna do with

734
00:47:45,885 --> 00:47:46,005
Speaker 12:  it

735
00:47:46,005 --> 00:47:47,765
Speaker 2:  Including like the dashboard of your car.

736
00:47:48,315 --> 00:47:52,085
Speaker 12:  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I mean I have been in, in

737
00:47:52,775 --> 00:47:56,485
Speaker 12:  Ubers where the driver has been listening to

738
00:47:56,625 --> 00:48:00,485
Speaker 12:  and I think watching a YouTube video. Same. Yes So,

739
00:48:00,485 --> 00:48:03,965
Speaker 12:  I've been going, you know, So I think that the will intentionally be that

740
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:08,165
Speaker 12:  blurriness, I I Do think though that

741
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:11,885
Speaker 12:  There is a real opportunity for audio in this world a real

742
00:48:11,885 --> 00:48:15,765
Speaker 12:  opportunity for something you know for your ears where

743
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:19,765
Speaker 12:  when your eyes are busy, I, I think that that is the thing that

744
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:23,485
Speaker 12:  podcasting has always been very good at using and

745
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:27,765
Speaker 12:  if we get rid of that unique selling point that podcasting

746
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,365
Speaker 12:  has and turn it into another form of video,

747
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:35,765
Speaker 12:  then I don't think that the world is a richer place for doing that.

748
00:48:36,245 --> 00:48:40,125
Speaker 12:  I think that There is something to be said for something which

749
00:48:40,145 --> 00:48:44,125
Speaker 12:  is specifically There for audio that you can enjoy while you

750
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:47,765
Speaker 12:  are, you know, going out for a walk while you're doing the dishes, while

751
00:48:47,765 --> 00:48:51,565
Speaker 12:  you are driving a, you know, a one ton truck down a highway I. Think all

752
00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:55,445
Speaker 12:  of those are very really important things and we should be

753
00:48:55,445 --> 00:48:59,285
Speaker 12:  very careful about whether or not we want to lose the benefit of a Podcast

754
00:48:59,585 --> 00:49:03,285
Speaker 12:  as being an audio first medium. Just because somebody at Spotify

755
00:49:03,545 --> 00:49:07,125
Speaker 12:  or at YouTube has told us that we ought to have the video side because

756
00:49:07,425 --> 00:49:10,125
Speaker 12:  as you So rightly say They earn more money from it,

757
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:13,285
Speaker 2:  Right? That's how They know how to sell ads. Yeah that is like you can, you

758
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:16,485
Speaker 2:  can boil So much of it down to that's how They know how to sell ads. Yeah,

759
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:17,965
Speaker 12:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

760
00:49:18,745 --> 00:49:22,565
Speaker 2:  So, What What about the user experience of of being a podcast listener.

761
00:49:22,685 --> 00:49:25,805
Speaker 2:  I mean e especially If, you think about some of the open apps,

762
00:49:26,945 --> 00:49:30,645
Speaker 2:  it wasn still RSS feeds with enclosures, right? We're we're dealing with

763
00:49:31,905 --> 00:49:35,805
Speaker 2:  not terribly dissimilar distribution technology to What we had 20 years ago.

764
00:49:36,355 --> 00:49:36,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

765
00:49:36,805 --> 00:49:40,445
Speaker 12:  I, I, I. Think I think RSS has

766
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:44,085
Speaker 12:  changed and is changing. Okay, So we've seen very recently, for example,

767
00:49:44,675 --> 00:49:48,085
Speaker 12:  transcripts appear in a bunch of podcast

768
00:49:48,595 --> 00:49:52,565
Speaker 12:  apps. Apple is doing transcripts for everything but If.

769
00:49:52,565 --> 00:49:56,445
Speaker 12:  you want to do a decent transcript and a transcript that you

770
00:49:56,445 --> 00:50:00,405
Speaker 12:  can trust, you can write that transcript for yourself, you can

771
00:50:00,405 --> 00:50:04,045
Speaker 12:  put that in the RSS feed and the app will pull that

772
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:08,165
Speaker 12:  creator made transcript in. Whether it's Apple Podcasts, whether

773
00:50:08,165 --> 00:50:12,045
Speaker 12:  it's Pocket Casts, antenna pod, you know, So on

774
00:50:12,045 --> 00:50:14,085
Speaker 12:  and So forth. So I think

775
00:50:15,785 --> 00:50:19,725
Speaker 12:  one of the problems that people, that people

776
00:50:19,915 --> 00:50:23,685
Speaker 12:  like Spotify have been trying to

777
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:27,605
Speaker 12:  convince us of is that you can't get some of the new

778
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:31,765
Speaker 12:  features that audiences would like into RSS

779
00:50:31,985 --> 00:50:35,485
Speaker 12:  and that really isn't the case. We you, when

780
00:50:35,655 --> 00:50:39,645
Speaker 12:  podcasting started, podcasting didn't have thumbnails, didn't have

781
00:50:39,935 --> 00:50:43,445
Speaker 12:  categories. There were a lot of things that podcasting didn't have

782
00:50:44,145 --> 00:50:47,885
Speaker 12:  and Apple came along and said, We want podcasting, but we want it to Look

783
00:50:47,885 --> 00:50:51,645
Speaker 12:  better. This is What we would like to add to the spec and

784
00:50:51,665 --> 00:50:55,605
Speaker 12:  one of the benefits of RSS is that it's extensible with a namespace.

785
00:50:55,745 --> 00:50:59,365
Speaker 12:  So. You can put that additional stuff in. There and So, I I think this is

786
00:50:59,365 --> 00:51:03,125
Speaker 12:  the exciting thing that I'm seeing with the podcasting

787
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:06,885
Speaker 12:  2.0 piece of work, which is being done by a bunch of,

788
00:51:07,445 --> 00:51:10,765
Speaker 12:  a bunch of geeks, including by the way, one of the current inventors of

789
00:51:10,815 --> 00:51:14,005
Speaker 12:  podcasting itself. Adam Curry, where they've actually gone.

790
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:18,165
Speaker 12:  Let's add a new namespace with some new ideas

791
00:51:18,585 --> 00:51:21,765
Speaker 12:  for how podcasting can work. So not just a transcript tag,

792
00:51:22,425 --> 00:51:26,085
Speaker 12:  but tags in terms of micropayments tags,

793
00:51:26,265 --> 00:51:29,685
Speaker 12:  in terms of locations, tags, in terms of cast lists,

794
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:33,845
Speaker 12:  all of the stuff that We have missed from the podcast

795
00:51:34,055 --> 00:51:37,885
Speaker 12:  world in the last 20 or So years and I think it's actually a very exciting

796
00:51:37,915 --> 00:51:41,645
Speaker 12:  time now seeing some of these new ideas coming

797
00:51:41,745 --> 00:51:45,445
Speaker 12:  in and seeing some of the more brave

798
00:51:46,075 --> 00:51:49,965
Speaker 12:  apps using some of the data which is now available in them.

799
00:51:50,505 --> 00:51:53,165
Speaker 2:  My last question to go all the way back to the beginning of What is a Podcast

800
00:51:54,105 --> 00:51:57,845
Speaker 2:  20 years later, did We name it the right thing? Should we, should We have

801
00:51:57,845 --> 00:52:01,365
Speaker 2:  just never called it a podcast in the first place? Call it a show and move

802
00:52:01,365 --> 00:52:04,885
Speaker 2:  on with our lives. Was was Podcast, right? Did We get that right In

803
00:52:04,885 --> 00:52:05,445
Speaker 2:  2004?

804
00:52:07,265 --> 00:52:10,585
Speaker 12:  I I think the podcast is a useful word

805
00:52:10,935 --> 00:52:14,545
Speaker 12:  because it says a few things. It says that it isn't a

806
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:18,345
Speaker 12:  broadcast, it's a Podcast, it's different and actually

807
00:52:18,545 --> 00:52:22,345
Speaker 12:  I think, you know, to come back to some of the mistakes that perhaps were

808
00:52:22,345 --> 00:52:26,185
Speaker 12:  made between 2019 and 2022, people were assuming that

809
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:30,065
Speaker 12:  podcasting was another form of broadcasting and you could reach tons and

810
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:33,065
Speaker 12:  tons and tons of people and that really isn't the case. It's more niche

811
00:52:33,065 --> 00:52:36,825
Speaker 12:  casting or niche casting If you like rather than anything else.

812
00:52:37,005 --> 00:52:40,945
Speaker 12:  So I think it's useful that it has a word I. Think it's

813
00:52:40,945 --> 00:52:44,825
Speaker 12:  also useful that it actually, the word helps define a

814
00:52:44,825 --> 00:52:48,265
Speaker 12:  little bit in terms of What. A podcast is in that

815
00:52:48,725 --> 00:52:52,705
Speaker 12:  the pod bit talks about portability, talks about being able

816
00:52:52,705 --> 00:52:56,625
Speaker 12:  to take that audio with you and a large amount of

817
00:52:56,625 --> 00:53:00,465
Speaker 12:  Podcasts listening happens in a mobile environment. Whether

818
00:53:00,575 --> 00:53:03,705
Speaker 12:  that happens to be on a car or public transport

819
00:53:04,725 --> 00:53:08,465
Speaker 12:  or going out walking the dog, So I think that it is useful

820
00:53:08,765 --> 00:53:12,585
Speaker 12:  to have that word, but I think that that word is becoming less and less

821
00:53:12,695 --> 00:53:16,545
Speaker 12:  like by the way, the word radio is becoming less and less about the

822
00:53:16,545 --> 00:53:20,385
Speaker 12:  technology and more and more about the type of programming

823
00:53:20,815 --> 00:53:24,225
Speaker 12:  that it happens to be. A podcast is very clearly a different

824
00:55:44,555 --> 00:55:47,725
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. All right, let's get to the hotline and before we do, I should

825
00:55:47,725 --> 00:55:51,365
Speaker 2:  confess something I was supposed to ask all of you a couple of weeks ago

826
00:55:51,705 --> 00:55:55,605
Speaker 2:  for hotline questions about 2004 I. Don't know

827
00:55:55,605 --> 00:55:59,085
Speaker 2:  What. Those would've been, maybe you have like a 20-year-old iPod you're

828
00:55:59,085 --> 00:56:02,285
Speaker 2:  trying to repurpose for something really cool or

829
00:56:02,785 --> 00:56:06,725
Speaker 2:  you're I don't know. Trying to like get all the files off

830
00:56:06,725 --> 00:56:09,605
Speaker 2:  your old spinning hard drive and having trouble I. Don't know. I'm sure it

831
00:56:09,605 --> 00:56:13,485
Speaker 2:  would've been fun and still If. you have 2040 questions

832
00:56:13,515 --> 00:56:16,925
Speaker 2:  that came up reading our package or listening to this podcast.

833
00:56:17,765 --> 00:56:21,565
Speaker 2:  I. Want to hear 'em all? The number is 8 6 6 VERGE one one. The email

834
00:56:21,585 --> 00:56:25,405
Speaker 2:  is vergecast at The Verge dot com. Send 'em all my way.

835
00:56:25,405 --> 00:56:29,165
Speaker 2:  Gimme your 2004 questions. I'll put on my Time machine hat and

836
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:32,965
Speaker 2:  we will, we'll see What we can do for now We have something completely unrelated.

837
00:56:33,315 --> 00:56:35,045
Speaker 2:  It's about iPads here. We, go.

838
00:56:36,385 --> 00:56:39,485
Speaker 13:  Hey Vergecast. I was wondering that I iPod mini seven,

839
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:44,245
Speaker 13:  I've got an iPod mini six and I freaking love it. I've also got a switch

840
00:56:44,245 --> 00:56:48,165
Speaker 13:  that I've been playing Tony Hawk skater on for a little bit and I just though

841
00:56:48,165 --> 00:56:51,965
Speaker 13:  like, well if They put a arm shift

842
00:56:52,195 --> 00:56:55,805
Speaker 13:  into the iPod mini seven, would it be an Nintendo Switch killer? Would it

843
00:56:55,805 --> 00:56:59,645
Speaker 13:  be like a steam deck kind of competitor or are we not There yet with gaming

844
00:56:59,765 --> 00:57:03,565
Speaker 13:  on the iPod yet? I? Don't know. Lemme know. What, you think, thanks, bye.

845
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:08,405
Speaker 2:  This is a super fun question and it's actually really timely right now

846
00:57:08,435 --> 00:57:12,405
Speaker 2:  because I think we're about to get a new set of

847
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:16,805
Speaker 2:  iPads potentially as soon as like this week because there's

848
00:57:16,805 --> 00:57:20,205
Speaker 2:  been a bunch of reporting that a new mini is coming. There's been a bunch

849
00:57:20,205 --> 00:57:23,485
Speaker 2:  of reporting that it's gonna be early November. Like is this is the time

850
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:27,125
Speaker 2:  that would be if it's gonna start shipping in early November. I also love

851
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:30,565
Speaker 2:  the iPod Mini and desperately would love it to be

852
00:57:31,025 --> 00:57:33,965
Speaker 2:  an intend to switch. It's the right size, it does all the other stuff. Like

853
00:57:34,305 --> 00:57:38,085
Speaker 2:  if that could be the thing, I carried around with me all the time, I'd be

854
00:57:38,085 --> 00:57:41,805
Speaker 2:  super into it. I, think There are two ways to Look at this

855
00:57:42,005 --> 00:57:45,885
Speaker 2:  question and I wanna get to them both. One is just a question

856
00:57:45,885 --> 00:57:49,405
Speaker 2:  of like would arm compatibility make

857
00:57:49,785 --> 00:57:53,685
Speaker 2:  the iPod a more useful gaming machine And

858
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:57,485
Speaker 2:  I think to some extent the answer to that is yes, right? Like if it were

859
00:57:57,485 --> 00:58:01,365
Speaker 2:  easier to take some of the games that run

860
00:58:01,425 --> 00:58:04,965
Speaker 2:  on other chips and just run them on

861
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:09,865
Speaker 2:  an iPod, sure, that would be fine. I, don't think in

862
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:13,825
Speaker 2:  any way, shape or form, that is the main problem here, right? Like for one

863
00:58:13,825 --> 00:58:17,545
Speaker 2:  thing, the the M series chips inside of the iPads are arm

864
00:58:17,675 --> 00:58:21,385
Speaker 2:  chips. They're very good arm chips. They are vastly more powerful

865
00:58:21,485 --> 00:58:25,345
Speaker 2:  arm chips than the stuff that's currently running inside

866
00:58:25,345 --> 00:58:28,825
Speaker 2:  of the Switch. Like I was actually just looking at these benchmarks today

867
00:58:28,825 --> 00:58:32,665
Speaker 2:  after I heard this question. If, you go back the

868
00:58:32,865 --> 00:58:36,505
Speaker 2:  Nintendo switch on Geek Bench six, which is just one

869
00:58:36,895 --> 00:58:40,745
Speaker 2:  sort of normal benchmark of What. It's like to use a

870
00:58:40,745 --> 00:58:44,105
Speaker 2:  system under a little bit of load. The Nintendo Switch scores

871
00:58:44,275 --> 00:58:47,945
Speaker 2:  702 on Geek Bench six. Again,

872
00:58:48,255 --> 00:58:51,585
Speaker 2:  none of these are perfect benchmarks, but they're just useful illustrations,

873
00:58:51,785 --> 00:58:55,705
Speaker 2:  right? So the Switch 7 0 2, the M four

874
00:58:56,285 --> 00:58:59,765
Speaker 2:  in the iPod Pro scores a

875
00:59:00,005 --> 00:59:03,885
Speaker 2:  14,621 like night and

876
00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:07,285
Speaker 2:  day. The the M four is actually closer in score

877
00:59:07,785 --> 00:59:11,765
Speaker 2:  to like high powered gaming PCs than it is to the

878
00:59:11,765 --> 00:59:15,545
Speaker 2:  switch and yet the switch is awesome, right?

879
00:59:15,565 --> 00:59:19,425
Speaker 2:  The processing power is not a problem. One, it's availability of games,

880
00:59:19,795 --> 00:59:23,565
Speaker 2:  which is I. Think the iPad's main problem. There are lots of

881
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:27,485
Speaker 2:  structural reasons for that over the years. Apple until very recently

882
00:59:27,745 --> 00:59:31,525
Speaker 2:  didn't want you to use gaming emulators

883
00:59:31,545 --> 00:59:35,525
Speaker 2:  for instance. There was no way to have game streaming services inside of

884
00:59:35,525 --> 00:59:38,605
Speaker 2:  the app store. Apple went to court with Epic

885
00:59:39,235 --> 00:59:42,925
Speaker 2:  over whether Fortnite was allowed to be in the app store. That's been a whole

886
00:59:42,925 --> 00:59:46,645
Speaker 2:  thing and I think will continue to be a whole thing. Apple loves

887
00:59:46,645 --> 00:59:50,525
Speaker 2:  games and has had lots of games in the app store, but

888
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:54,485
Speaker 2:  particularly on the iPhone. These are just not the games by and large people

889
00:59:54,485 --> 00:59:58,405
Speaker 2:  wanna play and So Apple hasn't really focused on them on the

890
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:02,485
Speaker 2:  iPod to be honest. I don't know exactly What, it is. I have

891
01:00:02,485 --> 01:00:06,445
Speaker 2:  been surprised over the years to see Apple not make a bigger push into trying

892
01:00:06,445 --> 01:00:10,285
Speaker 2:  to make this a really great gaming machine. And I think it's possible that

893
01:00:10,345 --> 01:00:14,045
Speaker 2:  as gaming emulators become more important and as game streaming

894
01:00:14,285 --> 01:00:17,845
Speaker 2:  services grow and come onto this, it will start to happen.

895
01:00:18,665 --> 01:00:22,325
Speaker 2:  But it's just a lot of work to make a game available

896
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:26,165
Speaker 2:  on a new platform and you just don't see

897
01:00:26,885 --> 01:00:30,205
Speaker 2:  Ubisoft being like our game is now available on

898
01:00:30,475 --> 01:00:33,965
Speaker 2:  PlayStation and Xbox and PC and

899
01:00:34,595 --> 01:00:37,925
Speaker 2:  iPod. Like it doesn't happen it, it doesn't work on Mac either. And Apple

900
01:00:37,985 --> 01:00:41,205
Speaker 2:  has been desperately trying to change that for years to make the Mac, which

901
01:00:41,205 --> 01:00:45,125
Speaker 2:  again is very powerful into a genuinely

902
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:48,685
Speaker 2:  competitive gaming platform. It's really hard to do that because

903
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:53,325
Speaker 2:  supporting any new platform is a ton of work and these companies by

904
01:00:53,325 --> 01:00:56,885
Speaker 2:  and large just don't get on board with a new one until There is

905
01:00:57,475 --> 01:01:00,645
Speaker 2:  vast evidence that it is going to be a good business and

906
01:01:01,665 --> 01:01:05,605
Speaker 2:  no Apple product has provided that evidence. There's also the way that Apple

907
01:01:05,715 --> 01:01:09,445
Speaker 2:  polices the app store and the way that it oversees things like in

908
01:01:09,475 --> 01:01:13,325
Speaker 2:  game transactions and the way that it wants it was cut. There's a business

909
01:01:13,355 --> 01:01:16,885
Speaker 2:  side of that that is very real I think that's starting to get stripped away

910
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:20,925
Speaker 2:  a little bit, which I think might make Apple products in general,

911
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:24,325
Speaker 2:  but especially the iPod a more interesting gaming platform. But all of that

912
01:01:24,325 --> 01:01:28,125
Speaker 2:  aside, I think the thing missing from the iPod Mini in

913
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:31,525
Speaker 2:  particular is not a really

914
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:35,565
Speaker 2:  great chip or even a really compatible chip. It's

915
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,525
Speaker 2:  a controller, and this is kind of a weird thing to say, but I, think If,

916
01:01:39,525 --> 01:01:43,325
Speaker 2:  you Look at the steam deck and you Look at the switch and you Look at even

917
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:46,325
Speaker 2:  some of these other game streaming devices. They have

918
01:01:47,715 --> 01:01:51,085
Speaker 2:  dedicated controllers for a reason, right? Like if you're

919
01:01:51,965 --> 01:01:55,005
Speaker 2:  building a game for the Nintendo Switch, you know exactly

920
01:01:56,075 --> 01:02:00,005
Speaker 2:  What people are going to be doing, whether they're using a controller or

921
01:02:00,005 --> 01:02:03,285
Speaker 2:  the joycons, whether the joycons are detached or attached,

922
01:02:03,825 --> 01:02:07,725
Speaker 2:  you know the controls that are available, right? And you see a lot of

923
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:11,445
Speaker 2:  games use those things in a way that makes sense. There is an

924
01:02:11,445 --> 01:02:14,165
Speaker 2:  assumption that like you're playing this game with a controller and I can

925
01:02:14,165 --> 01:02:17,925
Speaker 2:  do that. You can't do that with the iPod. Most people using

926
01:02:17,945 --> 01:02:21,885
Speaker 2:  an iPod I would say virtually everyone using an iPod is

927
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:25,645
Speaker 2:  not using a controller. And the iPad's technical

928
01:02:25,645 --> 01:02:29,525
Speaker 2:  controller support has actually gotten very good over time. You can connect

929
01:02:29,685 --> 01:02:32,525
Speaker 2:  a PlayStation controller, you can connect an Xbox controller. There are a

930
01:02:32,525 --> 01:02:35,605
Speaker 2:  bunch of really good third party controllers out There, I have a a steel

931
01:02:35,605 --> 01:02:39,405
Speaker 2:  series, one that I really like, but no

932
01:02:39,435 --> 01:02:43,245
Speaker 2:  developer can build one of those games on the assumption that you're using

933
01:02:43,365 --> 01:02:46,725
Speaker 2:  a controller and So, not only do They have to build their games differently

934
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,685
Speaker 2:  to work with a touchscreen, They have to build different kinds of games.

935
01:02:50,185 --> 01:02:54,165
Speaker 2:  You just can't build a game as successfully

936
01:02:55,195 --> 01:02:58,965
Speaker 2:  into a controller list ecosystem as you can into a

937
01:02:58,965 --> 01:03:02,005
Speaker 2:  controller one. You're just by definition going to build different kinds

938
01:03:02,005 --> 01:03:05,765
Speaker 2:  of games for a touchscreen. It's why you see games that are much more

939
01:03:06,695 --> 01:03:09,965
Speaker 2:  swipe based and they're about tapping things and inventories become really

940
01:03:09,965 --> 01:03:13,365
Speaker 2:  important and lots of turn based stuff as opposed to the kind of quick

941
01:03:13,765 --> 01:03:17,645
Speaker 2:  twitch controller stuff. There's some of that out There and more of

942
01:03:17,645 --> 01:03:21,405
Speaker 2:  that all the time and especially as products like the backbone get more

943
01:03:21,405 --> 01:03:25,245
Speaker 2:  popular on the iPhone in particular, you'll start to

944
01:03:25,245 --> 01:03:28,365
Speaker 2:  see that stuff kind of grow I. Think backbone has actually done really interesting

945
01:03:28,365 --> 01:03:32,205
Speaker 2:  work growing the gaming ecosystem on the iPhone just by

946
01:03:32,335 --> 01:03:35,965
Speaker 2:  being something like a targetable default controller.

947
01:03:36,545 --> 01:03:39,525
Speaker 2:  But in the broad scheme of things, and again, especially on the iPod, that

948
01:03:39,525 --> 01:03:43,485
Speaker 2:  doesn't exist. I think if Apple were to make

949
01:03:43,505 --> 01:03:47,295
Speaker 2:  it was own controller, that would go a really long way

950
01:03:47,295 --> 01:03:50,175
Speaker 2:  towards solving this because then you say, okay, this is the default thing

951
01:03:50,715 --> 01:03:54,455
Speaker 2:  and accessory makers would build to something like that. Spec

952
01:03:54,785 --> 01:03:57,895
Speaker 2:  There would be a way for developers to say, okay, this is probably What.

953
01:03:57,895 --> 01:04:01,695
Speaker 2:  People with controllers will be using They can start to target the

954
01:04:01,715 --> 01:04:04,455
Speaker 2:  one thing in the way that if you're a Nintendo developer, you can target

955
01:04:04,795 --> 01:04:08,695
Speaker 2:  the switches control set. The amazing thing obviously would be if Apple

956
01:04:08,695 --> 01:04:12,535
Speaker 2:  like built a gaming handheld and actually just gave me an iPod

957
01:04:12,535 --> 01:04:16,455
Speaker 2:  with detachable joycons, like that's the dream. I would like that very

958
01:04:16,455 --> 01:04:20,215
Speaker 2:  badly. That is a device I would use for many hours every single

959
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:23,935
Speaker 2:  day and would upgrade alarmingly quickly all the time. I kind of don't see

960
01:04:23,935 --> 01:04:26,575
Speaker 2:  that happening. I think if Apple were gonna build a dedicated gaming device,

961
01:04:26,955 --> 01:04:30,815
Speaker 2:  it probably would have by now. So, I. Think There

962
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:34,335
Speaker 2:  is a great gaming device inside of the iPod, but I think

963
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:38,575
Speaker 2:  because it's been So long and hasn't existed yet because of the way Apple

964
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:41,935
Speaker 2:  runs the app store and because of the pieces of What makes a great gaming

965
01:04:41,935 --> 01:04:45,215
Speaker 2:  console around the chip don't exist.

966
01:04:46,365 --> 01:04:49,925
Speaker 2:  I just don't see it happening. But I, hope I'm wrong. And If, you have an

967
01:04:49,925 --> 01:04:53,245
Speaker 2:  awesome gaming setup for your iPod. I would love to hear about it whether

968
01:04:53,245 --> 01:04:57,165
Speaker 2:  you've figured out the wire controller, the setup that works, or you've found

969
01:04:57,325 --> 01:05:01,125
Speaker 2:  a thing that plugs into the iPod Mini and makes it feel like a switch. I

970
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:04,805
Speaker 2:  wanna hear all of your iPod gaming setups because There is an amazing

971
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:08,445
Speaker 2:  game console in There and I Wanna figure out how to make it work? I have

972
01:05:08,445 --> 01:05:10,725
