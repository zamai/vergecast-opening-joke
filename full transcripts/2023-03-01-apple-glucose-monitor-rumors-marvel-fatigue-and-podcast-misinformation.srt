00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,480
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Vergecast, the flagship podcast of hyper

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,720
Speaker 2:  specific wearable sensors. Yeah, that's a, that's a thing and we're the,

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,400
Speaker 2:  we're the flagship for it. I'm your friend Alex Kranz and I'm super

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
Speaker 2:  excited about this week's episode because it's just a bunch of like really

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,800
Speaker 2:  neat conversations with coworkers and at least one

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,760
Speaker 2:  senior data analyst. Victoria's song is gonna be joining me

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,640
Speaker 2:  to talk about the latest rumors around Apple's, big progress in blood glucose

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,360
Speaker 2:  monitoring. This has been a very hot topic of conversation since Mark

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,960
Speaker 2:  Germond wrote a big piece in Bloomberg last week. In fact, this week,

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,760
Speaker 2:  Apple's VP of Health symbol Desai that in an interview with the

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,240
Speaker 2:  Hindu business line where the blood glucose monitoring work got name checked.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,520
Speaker 2:  She didn't say much, but it definitely feels like we're like in a moment.

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,400
Speaker 2:  So Victoria and I are gonna talk about that moment and then Ariel Shapiro

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,480
Speaker 2:  is gonna come on to talk with the data analyst at the Brookings Institution

16
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,360
Speaker 2:  all about podcast misinformation, which is super interesting. And finally,

17
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,000
Speaker 2:  I gotta admit I got selfish and I brought back Charles plu Moore

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
Speaker 2:  because we absolutely had to talk about the latest episode of the last

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,600
Speaker 2:  of us and all of the Marvel fatigue that's cropped up around

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,440
Speaker 2:  Antman and the wash quantum mania. So we're gonna go all over the place

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,200
Speaker 2:  this episode, but it's a lot of super interesting conversations. Stay tuned.

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,640
Speaker 2:  I'm doing great Victoria. Thank you for asking. So Victoria, I wanna talk

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,680
Speaker 2:  about this rumor first reported by Bloomberg that Apple has been working

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,440
Speaker 2:  on a device that will let you test your blood sugar because that is like

45
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,880
Speaker 2:  really, really useful for people with diabetes. But it could also be useful

46
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,360
Speaker 2:  for people who don't know they should get tested for diabetes. Am I right?

47
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,880
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,840
Speaker 4:  There's actually a lot of reasons why anyone might wanna test their

49
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,440
Speaker 4:  blood sugar, including like hardcore athletes who are doing

50
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,120
Speaker 4:  endurance races who are just like, oh my God, do I need to

51
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,800
Speaker 4:  fuel? Do am I, how are my carbs doing? So you know, there was this

52
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,160
Speaker 4:  article in Bloomberg from Mark Gorman, the quote unquote

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,280
Speaker 4:  Apple Profit this past week that was saying that Apple had made

54
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,400
Speaker 4:  huge strides in their non-invasive

55
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,520
Speaker 4:  glucose monitoring tech. And you know, that sounds pretty cool.

56
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,480
Speaker 4:  All it means is that you can read your blood sugar without having to

57
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,000
Speaker 4:  prick your finger, which, you know, any person with diabetes would know that's,

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,760
Speaker 4:  it's not fun pricking your finger to get a little blood test all the time.

59
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,760
Speaker 4:  So that is what's kind of been causing a little buzz in

60
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,600
Speaker 4:  non-invasive blood glucose monitoring this past week at least. But

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,520
Speaker 4:  you know, it's actually been around for a while. Like the concept of it has

62
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,040
Speaker 4:  been around for quite some time, like over 10 years. I want to say,

63
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:55,720
Speaker 4:  oh

64
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,000
Speaker 2:  Wow, I didn't realize this that long. Cuz I think when we think about testing

65
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,800
Speaker 2:  for, for diabetes testing your glucose, it's generally

66
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,920
Speaker 2:  the the pin prick just taking blood. And then also, I know there was

67
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,680
Speaker 2:  the patch, Nicole Wetsman did this wonderful piece about testing

68
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Speaker 2:  one of the patches and her blood sugar versus her friend who has

69
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,160
Speaker 2:  type one diabetes. So generally the idea is you have to take blood and some

70
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,040
Speaker 2:  people were working on, well what if you could actually get the, the blood

71
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,080
Speaker 2:  sugar level from sweat? Is that what Apple is doing?

72
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,320
Speaker 4:  No. So there's two types of non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. The first

73
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,240
Speaker 4:  type is optical and that's what Apple is working on. Optical is similar to,

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,880
Speaker 4:  you know how this Apple watch has a P P G sensor

75
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,520
Speaker 4:  and it reflects light into your skin and based on the

76
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,320
Speaker 4:  reflection that comes back, it can kind of estimate what your heart rate

77
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,840
Speaker 4:  is from that. So Apple is basically working on

78
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,800
Speaker 4:  a optical version using spectroscopy. Ah-huh. That

79
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,520
Speaker 4:  is basically going to, based on the article, shine light

80
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,960
Speaker 4:  into your interstitial fluid and based on that,

81
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,920
Speaker 4:  figure out how much blood sugar is in your body. So interstitial

82
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,560
Speaker 4:  fluid is the fluid that sits in the space

83
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,480
Speaker 4:  between your cells. It's basically how they get powered is

84
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,400
Speaker 4:  also where all the waste product goes out. There's glucose in

85
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,720
Speaker 2:  There. So it's not blood,

86
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,400
Speaker 4:  It's not blood, it is interstitial fluid, which is

87
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,280
Speaker 4:  the fluid between the spaces of your cells. Okay. And it,

88
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,880
Speaker 4:  it is a legitimate thing that they use to measure blood glucose. So it

89
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,760
Speaker 4:  sounds science fictiony, but it's, it's real. We all have it. It sits

90
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,480
Speaker 4:  right beneath the skin. That's what Bloomberg says that Apple is

91
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,200
Speaker 4:  approaching it from. But the other way is the way that you were mentioning

92
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,040
Speaker 4:  where you find blood glucose from a fluid, so that's

93
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,720
Speaker 4:  your urine, that's your tears. That's what a couple years back

94
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,560
Speaker 4:  Google was thinking of trying to make smart contacts that could read your

95
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,280
Speaker 4:  blood sugar from your, you know, your eyeballs. Yeah. The, the fluid there.

96
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,040
Speaker 4:  But this is very complicated. There's a lot of stuff that goes into this.

97
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,520
Speaker 4:  Well

98
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,000
Speaker 2:  It's complicated and also there's a lot of different body types and stuff.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,720
Speaker 2:  And oftentimes these tests initially are for just one type of

100
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,280
Speaker 2:  body, for one just type of skin type. We see a

101
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,200
Speaker 2:  lot of different ways that it can kind of then mess up. I think we're seeing

102
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,520
Speaker 2:  that right now, right? With with blood oxygen and some of the other

103
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,320
Speaker 2:  optical sensors that Apple and other wearables are making

104
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,040
Speaker 2:  where they don't work on darker skin colors and they just flat out do not

105
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,880
Speaker 2:  work at all on tattoos.

106
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,040
Speaker 4:  Right. So you know, in the case of the PPG sensors, these are

107
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,320
Speaker 4:  the green lights that you see on the back of every wearable that measures

108
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,280
Speaker 4:  your heart rate. That color of light is very much impacted

109
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,240
Speaker 4:  by melanin and by tattoo. So that's why you have a lot

110
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,920
Speaker 4:  of tattoo users who have very dense tattoos on their wrists who cannot use

111
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,720
Speaker 4:  the Apple watch properly. You know, they have to like get epoxy stickers

112
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,080
Speaker 4:  and stick that on and somehow that makes it work. It's slightly different

113
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,680
Speaker 4:  in the case of blood glucose because if you're gonna do optical blood

114
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,400
Speaker 4:  glucose measurements, you're gonna be using a type of infrared wavelength

115
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,360
Speaker 4:  and ideally you'll be using more than one wavelength.

116
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,800
Speaker 4:  But that causes its own problems because

117
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,000
Speaker 4:  blood glucose has a lot more challenges than heart rate

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,720
Speaker 4:  does. Heart rate is relatively easy. You're measuring your pulse

119
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,000
Speaker 4:  is essentially what you're doing with the optical sensors and you know, you

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,720
Speaker 4:  can feed pulse into an algorithm and that's cool. But blood

121
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,200
Speaker 4:  glucose is about infinitely more complicated because

122
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,880
Speaker 4:  glucose is a very, very tiny molecule and there's a lot of other

123
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,440
Speaker 4:  molecules in interstitial fluid in other places. So there's a lot of signal

124
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,880
Speaker 4:  interference. So that's one of the big problems there.

125
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,960
Speaker 2:  This is even more complicated, but also it feels like it

126
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,080
Speaker 2:  has an even higher risk if you fail. You know, if my

127
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,360
Speaker 2:  heart rate skyrockets, I'd like to know, but it's not

128
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,120
Speaker 2:  necessarily the end of the world. It could be because I took the stairs

129
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,640
Speaker 2:  too fast. It could be because I got really exciting or really devastating

130
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,520
Speaker 2:  news. If my blood sugar is off and I have say

131
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,360
Speaker 2:  diabetes or something, well that could just mean I die.

132
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,360
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's actually gonna be something that requires F D A

133
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,000
Speaker 4:  regulation our, our very good friend the Food and Drug Administration,

134
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,080
Speaker 4:  but that the stakes are higher with blood glucose. Right. Because you cannot

135
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,800
Speaker 4:  get this wrong for diabetics. So you know, the image

136
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,680
Speaker 4:  that we have of what these smartwatch blood glucose monitors are gonna be

137
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,520
Speaker 4:  is just replacing the finger pricks, replacing the

138
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,920
Speaker 4:  continuous blood glucose monitors that they use needles.

139
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,080
Speaker 4:  So that's kind of the perception that we have for it. But if you

140
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,000
Speaker 4:  read closely into the Bloomberg piece, I really don't think that's where

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,640
Speaker 4:  apple's gonna go first. So, you know, they were saying that they were gonna

142
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,280
Speaker 4:  do it to screen pre-diabetes and there's multiple types of

143
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,840
Speaker 4:  pre-diabetes. You know, the human body is a wonderland that we'd know nothing

144
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,400
Speaker 4:  about. Basically the, the further you go into health tech, the more you realize

145
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,960
Speaker 4:  how much doctors have no idea how this bo how our bodies work. So

146
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,720
Speaker 4:  basically, you know, they're talking about you wear this like

147
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,680
Speaker 4:  device all the time and it can continuously monitor

148
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,960
Speaker 4:  your blood glucose and then give you a ping and say hey

149
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,360
Speaker 4:  you might have risk factors for pre-diabetes and that's very

150
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,320
Speaker 4:  different than monitoring your blood glucose for a diabetic.

151
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,600
Speaker 4:  So what we're gonna see at least first is something I

152
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,280
Speaker 4:  think, I think similar to what Apple did with heart rate and

153
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,560
Speaker 4:  ECG and AFib. So apple's not diagnosing anything for you,

154
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,120
Speaker 4:  right? They're just saying, hey, you show signs that kind of

155
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,200
Speaker 4:  indicate that you might have this issue. So go see a doctor. And

156
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,800
Speaker 4:  that's what I think that they're gonna do based on like that article,

157
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,040
Speaker 4:  the idea of pre-screening for diabetes. That's what I think

158
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,120
Speaker 4:  wearable version of this is gonna go towards first at least.

159
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,800
Speaker 4:  I don't think we're gonna go straight into a wearable monitor for people

160
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,760
Speaker 4:  with diabetes Precisely because if you fuck up people might die and

161
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,440
Speaker 4:  nobody wants that.

162
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,160
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I was about to say like, so my, my mom has type two diabetes,

163
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,120
Speaker 2:  I am obviously at risk because family

164
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,920
Speaker 2:  factors and I wouldn't want my mom to rely on

165
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,800
Speaker 2:  solely an Apple watch unless it has really gone through the rigors and can

166
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,440
Speaker 2:  match that, that pin prick test. Whereas it might be nice for me to be able

167
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,000
Speaker 2:  to say, oh, I should have a conversation with my doctor and find out if I

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,680
Speaker 2:  just need to be less dumb about eating breakfast or

169
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,320
Speaker 2:  if I've got other issues.

170
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,600
Speaker 4:  I mean I, I have the same thing. My dad had diabetes, I have P C O S,

171
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,160
Speaker 4:  I am predisposed to being a diabetic. So you know, every single time I go

172
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,640
Speaker 4:  to the doctor they're like, oh, let's check your blood sugar levels.

173
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,040
Speaker 2:  Gotta know your a1c man. You gotta, you

174
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,880
Speaker 4:  Gotta, yeah, you gotta know your a1c. Yeah. So you know, the idea is to kind

175
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,360
Speaker 4:  of be like, Nicole put this a really great way,

176
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,360
Speaker 4:  a warning light for wearables to kind of go, Hey,

177
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,000
Speaker 4:  I think you should go talk to a medical professional

178
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,200
Speaker 4:  cuz you'll never get in trouble for saying, Hey, go talk

179
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,080
Speaker 4:  to a medical professional. We actually do not give you medical advice

180
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,880
Speaker 4:  and any wearable, you see, even the ones with FDA cleared features

181
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,680
Speaker 4:  are going to say this is not in lieu of medical advice and the

182
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,440
Speaker 4:  reason is liability. They don't wanna be in trouble for you not

183
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,920
Speaker 4:  listening to them, but they do want the credit for when it saves your life.

184
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,120
Speaker 2:  I, I do wonder if Apple does go down this route, and it's not a

185
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,040
Speaker 2:  diagnostic feature, but it is a feature, a warning feature. Does that

186
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,840
Speaker 2:  mean Apple's just kind of getting into the business of making us terrified

187
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,960
Speaker 2:  of our own bodies every time we put on an Apple watch?

188
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,680
Speaker 4:  I mean a little bit, I this is, this is the dark side of wearable

189
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,400
Speaker 4:  tech is that it can very much cause anxiety. And I wrote a thing

190
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,720
Speaker 4:  recently about, you know, how to use fitness truckers and smartwatches in

191
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,200
Speaker 4:  a less anxiety inducing way. And you know, I test these for a living,

192
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,440
Speaker 4:  I have anxiety because these things tell me certain, there was like

193
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,320
Speaker 4:  a woman who got one of the notifications on the Apple Watch and then took

194
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,240
Speaker 4:  like 900 ECGs over the course of the year because she was really

195
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,280
Speaker 4:  anxious and this was a study that they did and it does does induce this

196
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,120
Speaker 4:  level of anxiety within people. So that's the thing

197
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,800
Speaker 4:  that I don't think we as a society and at the medical community has really

198
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,400
Speaker 4:  come to grips with yet is the fact that this tech is very new.

199
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,080
Speaker 4:  You're putting monitoring in the hands of people, continuous

200
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,840
Speaker 4:  monitoring, passive monitoring, and then they go to their doctors with data

201
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,240
Speaker 4:  and the doctors are like, well I don't know what to do with this data. I

202
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,160
Speaker 4:  don't know how to help you with treatment. And in some cases it's very obvious

203
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,880
Speaker 4:  and okay, like, oh, we can see that you do have this issue

204
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,680
Speaker 4:  and in other cases doctors are just gonna be like, okay, so your

205
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,480
Speaker 4:  heart rate was high once and you're fine now. Right? Yeah. So the, the promise

206
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,400
Speaker 4:  is that, you know, remote patient monitoring, that's the real promise of

207
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,280
Speaker 4:  all of this. But when it comes to diabetes, I'm not even sure

208
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,800
Speaker 4:  how doctors would necessarily use it, but most

209
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,120
Speaker 4:  likely at first it'll follow the path that continuous

210
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,120
Speaker 4:  blood glucose monitors, this is like a, a tongue twister every single

211
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,040
Speaker 4:  time I have to say it like that they did, which is, you know, they were

212
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,920
Speaker 4:  not meant to be your primary form of testing blood sugar, they

213
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,440
Speaker 4:  were kind of a supplement. You were supposed to do the pinprick and then

214
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,040
Speaker 4:  that could be kind of a supplemental, you know, secondary type of

215
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,960
Speaker 4:  monitoring method. And it's most likely that if we do get this

216
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,680
Speaker 4:  technology in a wearable, that's probably what it's gonna be. But

217
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,880
Speaker 4:  getting it small enough to be an wearable, this is like a recurring theme

218
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,000
Speaker 4:  is very difficult to do because as I mentioned, the signal is gonna

219
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,520
Speaker 4:  be really small for glucose and it's just gonna be a lot of interference.

220
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,760
Speaker 4:  So the AI model, the algorithm has to be extremely precise. And then

221
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,640
Speaker 4:  on top of that, you know, there's, there's other issues with blood glucose

222
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,760
Speaker 4:  compared to heart rate that are a zillion times more complicated, not least

223
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,640
Speaker 4:  of which is that you and I can eat the same foods and our blood sugar

224
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,080
Speaker 4:  will decrease or spike at a different rate. It's not linear

225
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,160
Speaker 4:  per se. Yeah. So that's a lot. How are they gonna program

226
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,040
Speaker 4:  that? That's difficult. That requires a lot of testing, which

227
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,960
Speaker 2:  Right now it sounded like in Ingerman's article it sounded like it's

228
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,280
Speaker 2:  still very,

229
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,800
Speaker 4:  Very large.

230
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,120
Speaker 2:  Yes. This isn't even close to being on the wrist yet.

231
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,240
Speaker 4:  So, you know, the, the major milestone that Garmin was referring to is that

232
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,160
Speaker 4:  the first version of it was this giant thing that sat on a table and

233
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,480
Speaker 4:  now they're working on a prototype that's about the size of an iPhone that

234
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,320
Speaker 4:  you would wear on your bicep. So, you know, we

235
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,200
Speaker 4:  are years away. Like he does mention that in the article, right? He's not

236
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,160
Speaker 4:  saying that this is coming out next year. Yeah. It is a big milestone to

237
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,920
Speaker 4:  go from something that has to sit on a table to something that can be worn.

238
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,840
Speaker 4:  But going from an iPhone sized object to

239
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,600
Speaker 4:  a watch sized object is is a whole other ballpark. And that's

240
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Speaker 4:  really the challenge that you have with wearable devices in

241
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,600
Speaker 4:  general.

242
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,880
Speaker 2:  So next time we hear somebody say a rumor that the next

243
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,320
Speaker 2:  Apple watch is gonna have continuous glucose monitoring.

244
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah, no, that's, that's I call bullshit on that because

245
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,120
Speaker 4:  it's not easy to do first off and you know, they're probably

246
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,880
Speaker 4:  already in regulatory talks because this kind of product

247
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,720
Speaker 4:  doesn't exist. It just doesn't, there were some failed versions

248
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,400
Speaker 4:  of like smart watchy prototype versions of this stuff, but

249
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,200
Speaker 4:  you know, the FDA's probably gonna have to sit there and be like, okay, how

250
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,880
Speaker 4:  do we even get you to test this thing in a way

251
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,720
Speaker 4:  that's not going to endanger human life? And you know, I've, I've been

252
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,400
Speaker 4:  talking to some scientists about how they do test this type of technology

253
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,800
Speaker 4:  and first off they, they test it with a glass of water

254
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,800
Speaker 4:  because if you cannot read blood sugar from water, you're screwed and you

255
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,440
Speaker 4:  have to go back to the drawing board. And then they have another, like

256
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,640
Speaker 4:  they call it a phantom, which is kind of like a mannequin that has

257
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,880
Speaker 4:  human-like stuff on it and you know, it's a proxy

258
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,720
Speaker 4:  for human testing but it's not the same thing. So this stuff is

259
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,600
Speaker 4:  very hard to test in a safe way. Like, you know, the

260
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,520
Speaker 4:  ethics of testing this tech is really tough with SPO two. You

261
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,040
Speaker 4:  basically have to make people go hypoxic for a certain period of time

262
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,080
Speaker 4:  in a controlled setting, which, you know, hypoxia is

263
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,520
Speaker 4:  when your blood oxygen level goes to points where you should be in a hospital.

264
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,880
Speaker 4:  So this is very difficult testing to do and that's only one portion

265
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,840
Speaker 4:  of FDA regulatory clearance. There's also stuff like making sure

266
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,600
Speaker 4:  that the way you store your data is HIPAA compliant. That's just

267
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,280
Speaker 4:  regulatory clearance. Just because something has regulatory clearance

268
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:20,320
Speaker 4:  does not mean it's an accurate device for that particular

269
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,240
Speaker 4:  purpose. Like the easy way for me to say it is that yes, this tech

270
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,720
Speaker 4:  is being developed, yes we are seeing progress in terms of

271
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,440
Speaker 4:  miniaturization and accuracy. AI is getting better, the sensors

272
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,160
Speaker 4:  are getting smaller, but there's so many issues like

273
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,960
Speaker 4:  because most of the optical methods are using infrared light. Did you

274
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,800
Speaker 4:  know that if it gets hot in the room, the sensors are gonna pick up on that

275
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,840
Speaker 4:  and they may say you have a spike in blood sugar even though it's

276
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,200
Speaker 4:  just hot. Like that's an actual problem that scientists are dealing with

277
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,880
Speaker 4:  and that, you know, they had a study that showed that. So it's very

278
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,160
Speaker 4:  challenging from an AI perspective, from the fact that the signal is so

279
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,680
Speaker 4:  small and just the fact that you have to have so many

280
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,640
Speaker 4:  different wavelengths of infrared light that it could get

281
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:05,920
Speaker 4:  hot.

282
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,720
Speaker 2:  So one last question for you. Which do you think we get first, the Apple

283
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,280
Speaker 2:  watch with continuous glucose monitoring

284
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,640
Speaker 2:  or smart glasses from Apple that you would wanna wear in public?

285
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,360
Speaker 4:  God if Apple has figured out how to

286
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,640
Speaker 4:  handle the ambient light problem like

287
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,600
Speaker 4:  relatively well I think that because that you could use as

288
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,280
Speaker 4:  a heads up display, you know, you see them in cars now and

289
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,920
Speaker 4:  directions, there's, there's a, there's a use case for everybody there

290
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,600
Speaker 4:  that everyone will want to use that likely will not burn your

291
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,320
Speaker 4:  eyeballs off and is not something that requires

292
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,720
Speaker 4:  super regulatory clearance with lots and lots of clinical testing.

293
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,400
Speaker 4:  So I'm gonna guess that

294
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,240
Speaker 2:  I was unaware that smart glasses could potentially burn my eyeballs

295
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,720
Speaker 4:  Off. Well the contacts might.

296
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,480
Speaker 2:  Victoria, thank you for coming on and popping all of the hype bubbles.

297
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,600
Speaker 2:  Appreciate it.

298
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,720
Speaker 4:  I live to pop everyone's health tech bubble just by being a

299
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,280
Speaker 4:  wet blanket saying actually we're gonna have to wait a really

300
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,200
Speaker 4:  long time for all the cool stuff.

301
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,400
Speaker 2:  Okay, we're gonna take a break and when we get back we're gonna move from

302
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,880
Speaker 2:  talking about blood glucose monitoring to podcast

303
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,880
Speaker 2:  misinformation with Ariel Shapiro. It is actually really exciting.

304
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,960
Speaker 2:  They're totally unrelated but it's gonna be a lot of fun More right after

305
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,160
Speaker 2:  this.

330
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,960
Speaker 2:  Okay and we're back. And I'm here with Ariel Shapiro. Hey Ariel, how you

331
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,080
Speaker 2:  doing?

332
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,880
Speaker 7:  I'm doing well Alex, how are you doing?

333
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,760
Speaker 2:  I am doing fantastic. I hear you have been interviewing some people

334
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,920
Speaker 2:  about a very fun little segment for the show, all about

335
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,560
Speaker 2:  podcasting.

336
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,600
Speaker 7:  Yeah, A couple weeks ago I spoke with Valerie, who's a

337
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,360
Speaker 7:  senior data analyst at Brookings last year. She put together this tool

338
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,240
Speaker 7:  that I have been like obsessively playing with that tracks a

339
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,040
Speaker 7:  bunch of the most important political podcasts. Oh cool.

340
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,560
Speaker 7:  So it started out just looking at the frequency of

341
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,480
Speaker 7:  episodes in terms of conservative versus liberal versus moderate. But recently

342
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,000
Speaker 7:  they came out with a really extensive and troubling study

343
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,920
Speaker 7:  about misinformation in these podcasts and it really runs

344
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,800
Speaker 7:  the gamut. Some podcasts do pretty well in terms of fact

345
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,480
Speaker 7:  checking and then some one out of every five episodes will feature

346
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,240
Speaker 7:  either blatant misinformation or unverified

347
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,560
Speaker 7:  information. Oh

348
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,680
Speaker 2:  No, okay, so like what's the criteria here? Like does the Verge

349
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Speaker 2:  cast count? Does Joe Rogan count what counts as a political podcast?

350
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,520
Speaker 7:  So neither Verge Cast nor Joe Rogan were part of this

351
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,160
Speaker 7:  study. Okay. They limited it to specifically

352
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,960
Speaker 7:  political podcasts that rank or have ranked in

353
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,880
Speaker 7:  Apple Podcast top 100. Okay. So Joe Rogan doesn't count because

354
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,640
Speaker 7:  he's only on Spotify, so, but if he was on Apple he would count

355
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,760
Speaker 7:  or podcasts that are recommended through those podcasts through

356
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,560
Speaker 7:  Apple's algorithm. It doesn't encompass the entire political podcast world,

357
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,720
Speaker 7:  but it does look at the podcasts with the most reach.

358
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,080
Speaker 7:  So that's, you know, Ben Shapiro's show, that's

359
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,000
Speaker 7:  Steve Bannon's show, which is actually only allowed on Apple podcasts

360
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,240
Speaker 7:  of the major platforms. They are banned from YouTube and from Spotify,

361
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,800
Speaker 7:  but also, you know, shows on the liberal end of the spectrum like Pod Save

362
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,760
Speaker 7:  America. So Valerie talks about the findings of the data, what it

363
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,400
Speaker 7:  means for podcasting and what it means for tech companies and what they can

364
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,200
Speaker 7:  do with the findings.

365
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,240
Speaker 2:  Okay. Well that sounds like a very interesting conversation. Let's go ahead

366
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,800
Speaker 2:  and listen to it.

367
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,440
Speaker 7:  Thank you so much for being here, Valerie. Your research really seems to

368
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,080
Speaker 7:  be the first of its kind that's looking this in depth

369
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,240
Speaker 7:  at podcasts and what kind of information or

370
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,520
Speaker 7:  misinformation gets shared on them. And so we hear a lot about misinformation

371
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,080
Speaker 7:  on cable news and on social media. Why did you choose to

372
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,920
Speaker 7:  look into podcasts in particular?

373
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,160
Speaker 8:  So at the Brookings Institution, my team is really interested in

374
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,560
Speaker 8:  exploring artificial intelligence, emerging technologies

375
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,600
Speaker 8:  and their broader societal implications. And so for me that

376
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,480
Speaker 8:  also includes especially the role of new media and the

377
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,760
Speaker 8:  internet in shaping this information ecosystem. And so the

378
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,640
Speaker 8:  reason I thought about focusing on podcasts is because, well, it really struck

379
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,240
Speaker 8:  me as increasingly important. People love their

380
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,120
Speaker 8:  podcasters really there's kind of a, a unique attachment that

381
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,880
Speaker 8:  we see two podcast hosts and it seems like, you know, anybody can really

382
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,720
Speaker 8:  start a podcast. Obviously having a successful podcast is a

383
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,560
Speaker 8:  another question, but anybody can be a host, sort of anybody

384
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,400
Speaker 8:  can have the microphone, anybody can be an expert on anything that they

385
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,320
Speaker 8:  decide they're an expert on in that day. And so those kinds of

386
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,480
Speaker 8:  elements seemed really interesting to me as kind of this new media

387
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,880
Speaker 8:  aspect, sort of the Twitter personalities or

388
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,680
Speaker 8:  YouTube personalities who kind of gain their platform seems really

389
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,520
Speaker 8:  applicable to podcasting. But at the same time, there isn't that

390
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,280
Speaker 8:  kind of dialogue element to it. It's very much more

391
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,160
Speaker 8:  in the vein of a, a traditional media space where the

392
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,240
Speaker 8:  podcaster is, is speaking to the audience and there's not

393
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,920
Speaker 8:  a ton of dialogue possibilities usually it's a much more kind of

394
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,840
Speaker 8:  top-down information provision. And so I thought that was really interesting

395
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,880
Speaker 8:  as a dyk as well.

396
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,800
Speaker 7:  So I get the sense that podcasts don't really get as much attention

397
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,720
Speaker 7:  as they might deserve in terms of the political influence they can have.

398
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,480
Speaker 7:  Aside from like Joe Rogan who absolutely dominates the new cycle,

399
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,240
Speaker 7:  but especially because it's so easy to develop these parasocial

400
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,680
Speaker 7:  relationships with podcast hosts, it seems like they can

401
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,440
Speaker 7:  actually have a lot of influence. Why do you think this is an area that's

402
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,720
Speaker 7:  gone so unexplored?

403
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,080
Speaker 8:  I mean, I would say probably the biggest reason for

404
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,920
Speaker 8:  me at least is the challenge of the medium, the

405
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,680
Speaker 8:  kind of actual audio-based function of the medium versus

406
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,640
Speaker 8:  something like text-based analysis. So we, we see a lot of

407
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,520
Speaker 8:  research on Twitter, which you know, it's very short snippets of text, very

408
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,000
Speaker 8:  available up until recently, at least with the API

409
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,960
Speaker 8:  interface. So academics, researchers could really access Twitter

410
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,920
Speaker 8:  data very quickly. Podcasting, you know, I kind of, I had to

411
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,720
Speaker 8:  sort of think about a whole strategy and design an approach

412
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,560
Speaker 8:  to be able to collect the audio files and then from there, get the audio

413
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,840
Speaker 8:  files into a space that was, you know, large enough to hold

414
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,240
Speaker 8:  36,000 MP three s and then from there

415
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,520
Speaker 8:  transform it into a text-based format. And then from

416
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,280
Speaker 8:  there continue along to actually find small

417
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,120
Speaker 8:  claims, small elements in, you know, some of these hosts like

418
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,920
Speaker 8:  Joe Rogan obviously was not in this report given this sort of Spotify

419
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,720
Speaker 8:  exclusive nature of his podcast and the data

420
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,680
Speaker 8:  collection process. They sort of didn't align. But a lot of

421
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,560
Speaker 8:  these hosts like Joe Rogan, you know, like Steve Bannon will have, you know,

422
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,360
Speaker 8:  four episodes a day, hour long episodes. And so it's a lot of

423
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,080
Speaker 8:  text. And so the methods alignment was a bit of a

424
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,320
Speaker 8:  challenge to figure out. And so I think that has maybe

425
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,200
Speaker 8:  pushed some people away from the medium potentially in terms of an

426
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,000
Speaker 8:  analysis side of it. And then on the other end of the spectrum, I don't know

427
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,480
Speaker 8:  if people actually sort of saw this space as highly

428
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,400
Speaker 8:  political or highly politically charged in terms of the

429
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,160
Speaker 8:  content that people were producing. We have great series like Radiolab

430
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,960
Speaker 8:  or this American Life or you know, true Crime podcast like cereal.

431
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,560
Speaker 8:  And so, you know, I think maybe that's kind of the perception of the

432
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,360
Speaker 8:  medium, but there is this entire world of political punditry

433
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,440
Speaker 8:  that is growing increasingly popular and increasingly prominent.

434
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,440
Speaker 7:  And one thing that is pretty shocking when you look at the tracker

435
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,560
Speaker 7:  in terms of the frequency of episodes published, you, you separated

436
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,480
Speaker 7:  into conservative episodes, moderate episodes and

437
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,280
Speaker 7:  liberal episodes. And based on your criteria of shows

438
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,160
Speaker 7:  that appear in Apple's top 100 and affiliated podcasts that

439
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,880
Speaker 7:  are recommended through the algorithm, it is, is so overwhelmingly

440
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,840
Speaker 7:  conservative. Why is that? It, it seems, it seems just completely out

441
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,160
Speaker 7:  of balance.

442
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:53,480
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I mean, so there's two elements to that. One is, so the series

443
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,800
Speaker 8:  is not necessarily as imbalanced as the number of

444
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,600
Speaker 8:  episodes. So I, I'm not remembering the exact numbers at the moment,

445
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,520
Speaker 8:  but I think it's something like one and a half to one ratio for

446
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,200
Speaker 8:  conservative series. So say we have 40 conservative series,

447
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,120
Speaker 8:  we're gonna have 30 liberal series or something like that

448
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,040
Speaker 8:  in terms of the imbalance from the selection process. But then

449
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,680
Speaker 8:  when you get at the episode level, it's something like triple the amount.

450
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,440
Speaker 8:  So conservative podcasters are producing many,

451
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,360
Speaker 8:  many more shows than liberal podcasters. And so

452
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,080
Speaker 8:  I think that that is really what that explosion is built around is just

453
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,520
Speaker 8:  the kind of, you know, and, and Steve Bannon has a

454
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,360
Speaker 8:  less than PC way of saying it, of like flooding the zone

455
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,160
Speaker 8:  with garbage is sort of some sort of his media strategy.

456
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,360
Speaker 8:  And so, you know, we do see this kind of, you know, whether whatever the

457
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,320
Speaker 8:  quality is, we do see this approach of like continuing to air episodes

458
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,160
Speaker 8:  daily, sometimes multiple episodes a day. And I think that's a

459
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,120
Speaker 8:  lot more of the conservative media ethos built around talk radio,

460
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,640
Speaker 8:  things like that. And so I think that's where a lot of that originates from.

461
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,840
Speaker 8:  And so that imbalance I think is particularly striking at the

462
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,520
Speaker 8:  episode level. It's, I'd say less, it's still an

463
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,760
Speaker 8:  imbalance but less dramatic at the series level.

464
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,080
Speaker 7:  What surprised you most when you were going through the data?

465
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,440
Speaker 8:  You know, I think that there were a few sort of specific

466
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,040
Speaker 8:  things. One, I think that what surprised me actually

467
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,000
Speaker 8:  is the kind of disparity in terms of some shows really

468
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,560
Speaker 8:  do kind of air a lot of these types of claims somewhat

469
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,800
Speaker 8:  frequently, like maybe one in 10 episodes, one in five episodes for

470
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,680
Speaker 8:  some of 'em. And then there are really, I think very high quality shows that

471
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,600
Speaker 8:  are just, you know, do a really excellent job. And so the kind

472
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,200
Speaker 8:  of distinction between those that shared quite a bit of content

473
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:51,920
Speaker 8:  that was maybe unsubstantiated or not backed by evidence

474
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,480
Speaker 8:  versus those that really didn't do it much at all. And so that

475
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,960
Speaker 8:  distinction I think was, was quite visible

476
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,160
Speaker 7:  In your report. You found that overall in this, among the shows you were

477
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,720
Speaker 7:  looking at, that it was about one in 20 episodes featured either

478
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,360
Speaker 7:  unsubstantiated or false claims, but the worst offenders

479
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,720
Speaker 7:  had rates of 15%, 20% of their

480
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,320
Speaker 7:  episodes with this sort of misinformation. So is this a

481
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,520
Speaker 7:  podcasting problem or is this maybe limited to

482
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,080
Speaker 7:  a group of particularly irresponsible podcasters?

483
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:28,320
Speaker 8:  That's a good question as well. I mean, I think that the nature

484
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,000
Speaker 8:  of the medium is such that, you know, this type of content

485
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,880
Speaker 8:  just naturally filters in, it's very conversational,

486
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,680
Speaker 8:  very extemporaneous, somewhat informal, you know, people are

487
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,960
Speaker 8:  bound to throw around and you know, I think I did it at the beginning of

488
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,640
Speaker 8:  the show, people are bound to throw around like estimates that they remember

489
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,320
Speaker 8:  off the top of their head that may or may not be accurate. And so I think

490
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,280
Speaker 8:  that, you know, it's just a natural function of the kind of back and

491
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,760
Speaker 8:  forth of the medium. But you know, I do think as the medium

492
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,440
Speaker 8:  becomes increasingly concentrated in terms

493
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,200
Speaker 8:  of political series and even since the data collection for this

494
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,080
Speaker 8:  report was completed, there's you know, dozens of new

495
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,000
Speaker 8:  shows that are really kind of highly politically charged.

496
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,160
Speaker 8:  And so I don't see this necessarily as something that will

497
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,120
Speaker 8:  be fading or that is concentrated amongst just a

498
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,320
Speaker 8:  few people. It's something that I think will continue to grow as I think

499
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,120
Speaker 8:  the medium continues to, to grow as well.

500
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,640
Speaker 7:  And in terms of the frequency of misinformation that you found,

501
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,920
Speaker 7:  how does it compare to other types of media, whether that's TV or social

502
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,920
Speaker 7:  or you know, terrestrial radio?

503
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,040
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think that is, you know, it's hard to quantify

504
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,840
Speaker 8:  because the tools have been lacking. So

505
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,680
Speaker 8:  recent research up until, you know, maybe a couple years

506
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,520
Speaker 8:  ago really focused on domain based content. So

507
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,200
Speaker 8:  focused on what was perceived to be low quality domain sharing.

508
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,640
Speaker 8:  And even those, which is I think a very inclusive

509
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,960
Speaker 8:  definition and you're bound to grab a lot of content that

510
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,840
Speaker 8:  is, you know, it might be highly political, but it isn't necessarily

511
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,480
Speaker 8:  false. That was a very inclusive measurement tool

512
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,440
Speaker 8:  and even then it was very small in terms of the

513
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,400
Speaker 8:  repeated sharing especially was low. And then, you know, for users,

514
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,240
Speaker 8:  there's a few studies that look at users, I think it's, it's quite

515
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,080
Speaker 8:  low in terms of percentage that share information that links to

516
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,960
Speaker 8:  these sort of suspect websites or domains. And then other

517
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,440
Speaker 8:  research that's maybe gotten a little bit more complicated and look at at

518
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,360
Speaker 8:  like browsers and broader media habits really

519
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,040
Speaker 8:  gets into like, you know, I think the rate is maybe like one minute per day

520
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,840
Speaker 8:  or something is the exposure. And so that I think puts

521
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,800
Speaker 8:  into perspective the amount for podcasting. I

522
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,760
Speaker 8:  do think the fact that 70% of the series shared

523
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,640
Speaker 8:  something, and that's liberal podcasters, that's conservative podcasters,

524
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,920
Speaker 8:  that's moderate podcasters and those that I couldn't, you know, assign a

525
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,880
Speaker 8:  political ideology, 70% is very high, but based

526
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,720
Speaker 8:  on the nature of the medium, that doesn't necessarily surprise me. And

527
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,480
Speaker 8:  so I, you know, I would put this as like on the higher side, but

528
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,920
Speaker 8:  you know, it's obviously not every two episodes or every

529
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:21,080
Speaker 8:  side episodes. So I still think that it is comparatively

530
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,200
Speaker 8:  high, but not, not so, so high that we're entering

531
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,640
Speaker 8:  this like very troubling space.

532
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,720
Speaker 7:  Right? And some of these hosts that fall into the top

533
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,520
Speaker 7:  10 worst defenders are really prominent. So in addition to

534
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,840
Speaker 7:  Bannon who had the highest rate of one in five

535
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,600
Speaker 7:  episodes featuring this information, you had Charlie Kirk and Sean

536
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,600
Speaker 7:  Hannity very, very well known pundits, right? Is the issue that these claims

537
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,560
Speaker 7:  on the podcasting side just go unnoticed or that maybe

538
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,440
Speaker 7:  the audiences who are listening to them in the first place just agree with

539
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,200
Speaker 7:  them or that people who might look at media in a critical

540
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,680
Speaker 7:  sense just aren't really paying attention to these podcasts?

541
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,560
Speaker 8:  I think it's all three. You know, all three of those elements are

542
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:08,400
Speaker 8:  what makes this medium slightly different than television, which is much

543
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,080
Speaker 8:  more visible. You know, there's a fixed number of channels, there's a fixed

544
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,920
Speaker 8:  number of shows people are watching whether critically

545
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,960
Speaker 8:  or for confirmatory evidence. And there

546
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,600
Speaker 8:  are guardrails in place, right? Like after the election, Fox

547
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,200
Speaker 8:  News cracked down on what its pundits could say about the election,

548
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:31,280
Speaker 8:  especially after the safe harbor deadlines passed and when

549
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,000
Speaker 8:  there were kind of lawsuits flying around about voting machines.

550
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,600
Speaker 8:  And so, you know, there are sort of guardrails in place

551
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,280
Speaker 8:  a little bit, whereas in this space it's kind of, you know,

552
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,560
Speaker 8:  anything seems to go, it could be because it kind of flies under

553
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,080
Speaker 8:  the radar, this sort of sandbox of ideas where

554
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:54,040
Speaker 8:  you know, let's test out this possibility, see, see if it sticks,

555
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,880
Speaker 8:  see if it gets some traction, and then maybe expand it to a broader set of

556
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,960
Speaker 8:  conversations. And so I think that that's what makes

557
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,440
Speaker 8:  podcasting a bit different than those other spaces.

558
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,760
Speaker 7:  And so I know this is a complicated question, but what kind of steps

559
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,720
Speaker 7:  can the platforms take to mitigate these

560
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,400
Speaker 7:  misinformation issues?

561
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,400
Speaker 8:  I see a few ways to go about just

562
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,240
Speaker 8:  broadly even improving the medium. I mean the architecture is

563
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,080
Speaker 8:  so sparse for a lot of these apps that in in some

564
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,640
Speaker 8:  ways building that out a little bit, putting some investment into

565
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,920
Speaker 8:  a more collaborative medium potentially. You know, we

566
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,800
Speaker 8:  see on Twitter now with content moderation, it's kind of this wisdom of

567
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,720
Speaker 8:  the crowd approach. Wikipedia is a very wisdom of the crowd approach.

568
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,720
Speaker 8:  Reddit has moderators stack overflow, which is

569
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,320
Speaker 8:  more on the like data science side, maybe a bit of a niche

570
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,440
Speaker 8:  medium. But in any case, they all have these sort of

571
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,000
Speaker 8:  community based approaches. You know, podcasting could, could

572
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,120
Speaker 8:  experiment with something like that. Incorporating a little bit of an audience

573
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,080
Speaker 8:  check. You know, some apps have no potential even for

574
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,040
Speaker 8:  reporting series or reporting episodes or when they do

575
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,000
Speaker 8:  have that in place, it's so sparse and so lacking in detail

576
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,640
Speaker 8:  that you know, it's basically useless at that point. And so

577
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,160
Speaker 8:  reincorporating the audience, making it a little bit more of an interactive

578
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,040
Speaker 8:  medium potentially. Can users add transcripts? Maybe they wanna

579
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,880
Speaker 8:  add show notes. I know that some podcasters who have really kind of loyal

580
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,640
Speaker 8:  fan bases have this automatically, like now there's a

581
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,920
Speaker 8:  podcast about the Joe Rogan experience podcast,

582
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,000
Speaker 7:  Right? Like

583
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,720
Speaker 8:  Summarize it so like, you know, obviously some shows don't have

584
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,640
Speaker 8:  that loyal of a following or that kind of excited of a

585
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,600
Speaker 8:  following, but like building in some opportunity for that potential I think

586
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,080
Speaker 8:  would be really useful. Absent broader content moderation

587
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,240
Speaker 8:  practices, I think, you know, just transparency in general, like

588
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,040
Speaker 8:  what are your content moderation practices detailing those.

589
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:00,920
Speaker 8:  I think Apple has something that in their prac content moderation practices,

590
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,720
Speaker 8:  it's like mean-spirited content, but like what does that mean?

591
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,840
Speaker 7:  That could be anything,

592
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,720
Speaker 8:  Right? What does that mean? And then, you know, thinking about like

593
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,680
Speaker 8:  the algorithms that govern what serious people are exposed to

594
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,520
Speaker 8:  transparency around those, right? So I think that, you know,

595
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,200
Speaker 8:  other than word of mouth, those lists that are curated

596
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,920
Speaker 8:  are often ways that people find podcasts. And so,

597
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,520
Speaker 8:  you know, what goes into making those lists, obviously people are gonna then

598
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,240
Speaker 8:  try and game those lists and so, you know, being careful

599
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,400
Speaker 8:  but providing a little bit more transparency around that are their

600
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,200
Speaker 8:  series that, or lines where the content can stay up

601
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,080
Speaker 8:  but it won't be recommended or things like that. So just the broader

602
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,600
Speaker 8:  transparency space I think can be really greatly improved.

603
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:50,600
Speaker 8:  A little bit more effort into kind of the community

604
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,560
Speaker 8:  that's building around a lot of these podcasts, letting the audience

605
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,800
Speaker 8:  play a role, kind of removing that top down

606
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,840
Speaker 8:  information flow and adding like a bottom up conversation as

607
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,480
Speaker 8:  well I think could be really useful too. And then, you know, beyond

608
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,040
Speaker 8:  platforms, you know, I would love to see more researchers paying attention

609
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,800
Speaker 8:  to this medium. I hope that this research project has shown that

610
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,400
Speaker 8:  it's possible to explore this space systematically,

611
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,960
Speaker 8:  even though I only, you know, bit off 79

612
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,040
Speaker 8:  series out of, you know, the thousands that are out there and

613
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,680
Speaker 8:  36,000 episodes out of the millions that are out there. But it was

614
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,480
Speaker 8:  sort of strategic and systematic. And so it is possible to

615
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,320
Speaker 8:  explore this space in a way that is

616
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:39,680
Speaker 8:  productive as opposed to cherry picked here and there for the

617
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,880
Speaker 8:  worst offenders. And so hopefully I think that

618
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,520
Speaker 8:  galvanizes the research community a bit more because I do see this space

619
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,400
Speaker 8:  as, as growing and becoming increasingly prominent. Have

620
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,120
Speaker 7:  The platforms reached out at all saying, hey, maybe maybe we should change

621
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,840
Speaker 7:  our approach a little bit or be more specific in how we

622
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,760
Speaker 7:  define dangerous content.

623
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:04,200
Speaker 8:  I mean, I have seen even from past research,

624
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,120
Speaker 8:  so this is kind of the major report out of a lot

625
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,040
Speaker 8:  of, out of about two years of research into this space in

626
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,920
Speaker 8:  which various blog posts were published on the Brookings website. And so

627
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,840
Speaker 8:  even from those, I've seen shifts from the platforms a

628
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,560
Speaker 8:  bit. So Google has made it clear that they

629
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,320
Speaker 8:  aren't actually hosting content in like popups

630
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:31,160
Speaker 8:  on their website. So you know, I think that's a clear distinction between

631
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,440
Speaker 8:  like a Twitter and a Google podcast is the hosting element.

632
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,680
Speaker 8:  You know, apple has expanded, its sort of feedback

633
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,240
Speaker 8:  form to include specific categories that do align

634
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,200
Speaker 8:  with their content moderation practices. It's unclear if that's

635
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,120
Speaker 8:  wholly in response to this sort of line of research inquiry. But I have seen

636
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,680
Speaker 8:  some small changes. Another one that's an interesting one

637
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,440
Speaker 8:  actually is also Apple. You know, a lot of these shows

638
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,240
Speaker 8:  used to be classified as news and so

639
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:05,160
Speaker 8:  we would see, you know, the wrestling BA show or Pot Save

640
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,920
Speaker 8:  America or whatever being classified as news and you know,

641
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,800
Speaker 8:  there's now a new category that is news commentary. And so

642
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,520
Speaker 8:  I think that that is really important as well just to be able to

643
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,920
Speaker 8:  add in a layer of editorialization

644
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:23,920
Speaker 8:  because you know, it is news commentary, it's, it's not necessarily

645
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,880
Speaker 8:  news. And so I think that's also like a micro shift that

646
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,640
Speaker 8:  is meaningful in some respects, but there's way more to do in this space.

647
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,600
Speaker 8:  And I think that the apps have recognized it as a

648
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,440
Speaker 8:  space that will need to be dealt with, especially for places that

649
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,200
Speaker 8:  are thinking about more monetization, expanding sort of

650
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,600
Speaker 8:  these, you know, exclusive arrangements or

651
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,680
Speaker 8:  you know, like Apple Podcast plus or things like that where

652
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,640
Speaker 8:  they have additional content or things like that. So actually paying a bit

653
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,480
Speaker 8:  more attention to these things I think as the monetization grows

654
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,560
Speaker 8:  will definitely be something that I would see a lot of these places doing.

655
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,760
Speaker 7:  A lot of these platforms have very explicit policies on

656
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,400
Speaker 7:  overtly dangerous content, right? Violent content,

657
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,440
Speaker 7:  clear hate speech. And then when you get into misinformation that that's

658
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,960
Speaker 7:  just a little bit trickier, how far do you think they'll be willing to go

659
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,920
Speaker 7:  to tackle misinformation?

660
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:24,280
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I mean I, I think that that's a huge challenge when we saw it a ton

661
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,120
Speaker 8:  during the pandemic, right? Like especially as the pandemic

662
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,080
Speaker 8:  evolved, things that were obviously incorrect at a certain point

663
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,680
Speaker 8:  in time then became more accurate down the road. And so

664
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,400
Speaker 8:  while I think it's important to add sourcing

665
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,680
Speaker 8:  or notes or things like that, tags that say like, the claims

666
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,160
Speaker 8:  made in this are blah, blah blah or are the opinion of the

667
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,080
Speaker 8:  podcaster or here's your coronavirus

668
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,120
Speaker 8:  information center, or things like that, you know, I think all those things

669
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,720
Speaker 8:  are important and just giving people more context

670
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,000
Speaker 8:  and more ability to find the authoritative information

671
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:06,080
Speaker 8:  I think would be really useful as opposed to saying, you know, oh, you

672
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,000
Speaker 8:  shared this theory, like delete your episode, one more strike,

673
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,920
Speaker 8:  you're done. Because I do think what that has shown us is that

674
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,400
Speaker 8:  it's a really, like, especially in the midst of an

675
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,000
Speaker 8:  evolving health crisis, the information ecosystem is very

676
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,920
Speaker 8:  fluid, but it's also important to make sure people have access

677
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,880
Speaker 8:  to, you know, the latest medical guidelines or the,

678
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,360
Speaker 8:  the latest recommendations. And so, you know, incorporating that

679
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,840
Speaker 8:  into the architecture of the apps

680
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,240
Speaker 8:  I think would be really important as well.

681
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,160
Speaker 7:  Where do you think we are in terms of moderating

682
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,360
Speaker 7:  audio technologically, right? Like we, we've seen some improvements already.

683
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,800
Speaker 7:  You know, Spotify recently acquired a company that

684
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:53,600
Speaker 7:  uses AI to identify dangerous

685
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,800
Speaker 7:  information, they look for specific buzzwords, that kind of thing. How much

686
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,280
Speaker 7:  further does the technology have to improve before we can really

687
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,920
Speaker 7:  adequately moderate this kind of content?

688
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:06,160
Speaker 8:  I mean, there's two things I'll say to that. So one

689
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,040
Speaker 8:  is regardless of the machine learning

690
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,760
Speaker 8:  algorithm or whatever detection software is in

691
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,400
Speaker 8:  place, I think it's so important to still have a level of human

692
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,360
Speaker 8:  oversight. This report required at least two

693
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,960
Speaker 8:  coders for every episode that was flagged through

694
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,000
Speaker 8:  a text-based process. And so because of the

695
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,520
Speaker 8:  context around these claims, because of the nature

696
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:36,720
Speaker 8:  of the conversation, it's really important to be able to, to

697
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,080
Speaker 8:  have people to be able to actually get in there and, and look at the

698
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,360
Speaker 8:  surrounding content, which I think at this point is very much

699
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,120
Speaker 8:  still in the realm of human review. There are ways

700
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,800
Speaker 8:  to sort of look at like negating words or things like that or

701
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,920
Speaker 8:  to add that context in a little bit. But I do think that having that human

702
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,800
Speaker 8:  oversight is super important. And then even in terms of progress,

703
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,440
Speaker 8:  even in the span of this research project, we were using

704
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:07,800
Speaker 8:  sort of larger platform transcription tools that had a

705
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,960
Speaker 8:  cost associated with them. And so even in that span,

706
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:14,920
Speaker 8:  OpenAI has it's, it's called Whisper, which is a

707
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,800
Speaker 8:  free open source software for transcription and it

708
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,760
Speaker 8:  does a fairly good job. You know, even the AI

709
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,040
Speaker 8:  software that I use for speech to text recognition failed occasionally.

710
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,360
Speaker 8:  One of the funny ones that I came across was like Fauci s role, like

711
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,280
Speaker 8:  Anthony Fauci s role in all this sometimes transcribed

712
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,040
Speaker 8:  to like foul cheese roll.

713
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,720
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

714
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,520
Speaker 8:  And that was paid for, right? And so, right, there's still those issues in

715
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,080
Speaker 8:  that space as well, but Whisper has obviously some of those

716
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,040
Speaker 8:  challenges built into it still, even with the kind

717
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,360
Speaker 8:  of state-of-the-art softwares, we were still getting some of those bugs in

718
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,240
Speaker 8:  which obviously is par for the course, I think would

719
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,040
Speaker 8:  likely lead to an undercount as opposed to an overcount. But

720
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,760
Speaker 8:  even so, like now there are open source softwares that we can use

721
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,840
Speaker 8:  to make this a much more affordable process. Even

722
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,760
Speaker 8:  podcasters if they want to add free transcripts to their episodes, can

723
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,640
Speaker 8:  do it now using these softwares. And so I think that that

724
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,400
Speaker 8:  has been an evolution that has happened quite quickly. And so

725
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,200
Speaker 8:  it's kind of a, a mixed bag, right? Like there still has to be, I think

726
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,920
Speaker 8:  that level of manual oversight to make sure that sort of

727
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,600
Speaker 8:  the context of the claim, the intent of the claim or

728
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,760
Speaker 8:  whatever is being searched for are actually meaning what we think

729
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,720
Speaker 8:  they're meaning. And you know, while sort of automated processes can

730
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,480
Speaker 8:  help with that, the manual oversight is, I still think very important, but

731
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,000
Speaker 8:  then the tools are evolving and becoming more accessible as well.

732
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,800
Speaker 8:  And so I think it's, it's a bit of both,

733
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,720
Speaker 7:  You know, every election cycle it seems like there's a new

734
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,040
Speaker 7:  media narrative that emerges, right? Like cable news is

735
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,920
Speaker 7:  the problem or Facebook is the problem, or Twitter is the problem. And

736
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,560
Speaker 7:  we haven't really seen podcasting get much credit or

737
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,480
Speaker 7:  blame for how it's shaping political thought. Do you think that's

738
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,160
Speaker 7:  something that's gonna change in the 2024 cycle?

739
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:15,480
Speaker 8:  I mean, the thing about podcasting and a lot of the

740
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,000
Speaker 8:  kind of political hosts is that they have platforms everywhere. So

741
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,600
Speaker 8:  podcasting is just another tool in a broader

742
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,320
Speaker 8:  portfolio, right? Where they have a Twitter presence, maybe they're on a

743
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,800
Speaker 8:  cable news channel, also potentially on the radio also potentially on

744
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,520
Speaker 8:  podcasting. And so I think whether it is the,

745
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,320
Speaker 8:  the primary focus, I don't necessarily think so, but I think it only

746
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,800
Speaker 8:  can amplify. And by virtue of the challenges

747
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,960
Speaker 8:  inherent to analyzing the medium might be a space

748
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,880
Speaker 8:  where, you know, something that was maybe taken off of Twitter flies in

749
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,400
Speaker 8:  the podcasting world. You know, hopefully it can be incorporated

750
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:56,400
Speaker 8:  into a suite of kind of analysis processes that

751
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,280
Speaker 8:  explores all these different spaces as opposed to, you know, just

752
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,160
Speaker 8:  Twitter or just Facebook or just YouTube, you know, thinking

753
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,560
Speaker 8:  of them holistically is, is really important.

754
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,040
Speaker 7:  Valerie, thank you so, so much.

755
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,280
Speaker 8:  Of course.

756
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:20,200
Speaker 2:  Okay, we're gonna take one more break and then we're gonna be talking about

757
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,520
Speaker 2:  something that is really, really fun that I'm super excited about, entertainment

758
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,920
Speaker 2:  coverage. Charles Pullam Moore is gonna be talking with me all about the

759
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,800
Speaker 2:  last of us and Ant Man and the WASP Quantum mania. It's just a bunch

760
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,920
Speaker 2:  of nerds nerd now more right after this,

761
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:44,120
Speaker 9:  It's late, you're almost home after catching that concert you and your friend

762
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,040
Speaker 9:  snag tickets to with MX months ago. You're all speechless from the last

763
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,200
Speaker 9:  hour spent singing your hearts out. And the only thing playing in the car

764
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:55,200
Speaker 9:  is the last song of the night on a full blast in your head.

765
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,960
Speaker 9:  Admit it. You want it stuck there. The live version you can't get

766
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,800
Speaker 9:  anywhere else looks like you're getting goosebumps all over again.

767
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:07,800
Speaker 9:  When the night's a hit, that's when you're with amex. American Express.

768
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,160
Speaker 9:  Don't live life without it.

769
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,040
Speaker 10:  The world looks different behind the handle bars of a rat electric bike

770
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:17,560
Speaker 10:  grabbing takeout looks less like greasy styrofoam boxes and more like

771
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,520
Speaker 10:  a cross town adventure ride shares look less like piling into the back

772
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,240
Speaker 10:  of a car and more like grabbing fresh air with your friends and

773
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,040
Speaker 10:  commuting can even start to look like the best part of your day.

774
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,760
Speaker 10:  That's because with Rad the world is what you make of it, not what it makes

777
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,440
Speaker 2:  And we're back and I've got Charles Pulley Moore here to talk about the last

778
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,360
Speaker 2:  of us in and Marvel fatigue. Yeah, let's start with

779
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,600
Speaker 2:  our last of us because this was the first time we met Riley. They're doing

780
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,440
Speaker 2:  the adaptation of the DLC from the game and it was an

781
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,160
Speaker 2:  absolutely emotional downer of an episode. Ri,

782
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,080
Speaker 10:  Why

783
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,040
Speaker 2:  Have you been? I will tell you everything you have to come with me for a

784
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,920
Speaker 2:  few hours. You trust we're almost to the end of the first

785
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,080
Speaker 2:  season. This was the big episode where we did like

786
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,840
Speaker 2:  flashbacks to stuff that was in comic books and

787
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,320
Speaker 2:  stuff, right?

788
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:20,520
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Like Riley is mentioned in the first last of us, but it isn't

789
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,240
Speaker 11:  until the last of us comic that we really sort of start to see the full

790
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,760
Speaker 11:  story of what went down between Riley. Not just like how they

791
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,520
Speaker 11:  were friends and the qsy, but sort of like one of the most like

792
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,240
Speaker 11:  momentous parts of their relationship. Like takes place sort of like

793
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,120
Speaker 11:  right before the video game picks up. And so when we are meeting Ellie

794
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,840
Speaker 11:  as like a player, it's just sort of like, oh, who's this aloof kid

795
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,800
Speaker 11:  who's just kind of sort of out about, you know, in the wilderness, you

796
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,600
Speaker 11:  know, doing their own thing. And Ellie, you know, is truly like in

797
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,480
Speaker 11:  the thick of like some emotional distraughtness that

798
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,720
Speaker 11:  Joel is included into, and we're not clued into because you know, we're

799
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,680
Speaker 11:  seeing things from his perspective. But when you dig into the comic you

800
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,000
Speaker 11:  sort of see like, oh, like Ellie, she's not an asshole, right? Like she's

801
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,560
Speaker 11:  coping with everything. This episode just really just introduces us to Riley

802
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,520
Speaker 11:  with a fullness that was not the case in the video game and

803
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,960
Speaker 11:  in the same way that a lot of people were sort of like lit up by episode

804
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,720
Speaker 11:  three long, long time. And the way that it sort of brought Frank and Bill

805
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,440
Speaker 11:  into the picture. Yeah, I remember when I was watching the screeners, I

806
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,480
Speaker 11:  had that same feeling for this episode because like you said, it is

807
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,360
Speaker 11:  another flashback episode with some sort of sad moments, but

808
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,240
Speaker 11:  it's also sort of this bottle episode that uses its

809
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,040
Speaker 11:  being in the past to show you like what all these people have lost

810
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,560
Speaker 11:  and it just like really moves me.

811
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:43,840
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I thought it was interesting we'd kind of been teased about Riley

812
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:47,800
Speaker 2:  on the show. There was this expectation because there had been this,

813
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,520
Speaker 2:  this D l C starring her. There had been this comic book featuring her,

814
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:55,720
Speaker 2:  so fans knew who Riley was and there was almost treated

815
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:59,240
Speaker 2:  like an Easter egg in early episodes where people would mention Riley and,

816
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,200
Speaker 2:  and Ellie would get all stone-faced and upset. But now we finally, we

817
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,000
Speaker 2:  finally see her and, and Storm Reeb really has to like live up to a lot of

818
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,280
Speaker 2:  hype,

819
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,400
Speaker 11:  Right? In the same way that we are supposed to really sort of have this

820
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,240
Speaker 11:  deeper understanding of the pain that Joel is carrying

821
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,160
Speaker 11:  with him after we sort of meet his daughter Sarah. The same sort of has

822
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,640
Speaker 11:  to happen here after we meet Riley. Obviously their dynamic is a little

823
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,760
Speaker 11:  different. So like in the context of the show, given that we've had another

824
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,400
Speaker 11:  bottle episode that was about Bill and Frank, I think that the, the challenge

825
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,400
Speaker 11:  that Storm Reed was really up against in

826
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:36,600
Speaker 11:  portraying Riley was like, you have all of sort of like the the

827
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,480
Speaker 11:  textual elements of the character that we have from the comic and the game,

828
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,000
Speaker 11:  but then within the context of the show, you also sort of have to nail,

829
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,640
Speaker 11:  I hate to put it this way, but like, surprise, you're another sad queer

830
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:51,560
Speaker 11:  character who exists wholly in the past. We need you to exist here

831
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,480
Speaker 11:  and stand out from the other sad gays that our show has had. Can you

832
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:55,760
Speaker 11:  do it?

833
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,440
Speaker 2:  No, but that's, that's true. Like,

834
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,280
Speaker 11:  Like you and I are two queers who watch a lot of media and we consume

835
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,800
Speaker 11:  a lot of queer like sad queer media in particular. And it's like

836
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:07,200
Speaker 2:  A hundred percent

837
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,280
Speaker 11:  You get like one in a show, it's like, all right, you've used your, your

838
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,000
Speaker 11:  ticket to sad queer town do something a little different. And for this show

839
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,200
Speaker 11:  to be like, oh, we're going back for another one.

840
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:16,840
Speaker 2:  What do we do now?

841
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,120
Speaker 2:  We're gonna figure it out.

842
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:24,160
Speaker 11:  I think that in focusing on like a young lesbian

843
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,920
Speaker 11:  romance between two teenage girls in the apocalypse, that in and of

844
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,760
Speaker 11:  itself already fundamentally shifts what kind of story is being told, right?

845
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,600
Speaker 11:  Like right. This episode was really sort of great because

846
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,560
Speaker 11:  it picks up at a, it's not really showing you the origins of their

847
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,440
Speaker 11:  friendship and their bond. We sort of meet them. Riley is essentially like

848
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:46,880
Speaker 11:  gone missing and everyone assumes that she's dead. Are

849
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,920
Speaker 12:  You okay? I'm fine. I just ran away for a bit. That's

850
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,040
Speaker 2:  All.

851
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:54,000
Speaker 11:  So many of these scenes kind of reinforce that the loneliness that Ellie

852
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,680
Speaker 11:  leads with that hard loneliness, that hardened loneliness that she leads

853
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,480
Speaker 11:  with, that was coming in fits and starts here when this

854
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,440
Speaker 11:  episode opens. You know, we're seeing that she's being bullied by these

855
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,960
Speaker 11:  other kids at school and she's, you know, she's whipping these bullies asses,

856
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,840
Speaker 11:  which is great, but she's also really sort of in pain in a

857
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,360
Speaker 11:  way that she thinks she's never really gonna be able to pull herself out

858
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,840
Speaker 11:  of until Riley shows back up

859
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:19,360
Speaker 12:  Tonight. I'm gonna show you the four wonders of them all.

860
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,760
Speaker 2:  I think what's interesting if we compare and contrast this with the Bill

861
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,520
Speaker 2:  and Frank episode, cause I think there's a lot to compare and contrast there,

862
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,160
Speaker 2:  right? Is that this episode is much more about highlighting that

863
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,880
Speaker 2:  loneliness. Mm. And so we really feel like

864
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,840
Speaker 2:  the stakes to her saving and protecting Joel in this episode and in

865
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,640
Speaker 2:  the episodes that are gonna follow has to hit a lot harder. And I think both

866
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,600
Speaker 2:  actresses just did a really, really fantastic job of, of nailing this

867
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,200
Speaker 2:  relationship and making us feel something so

868
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,040
Speaker 2:  that her, her loneliness and, and her, her

869
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,760
Speaker 2:  stakes are all kind of there for the rest of this, for this next big

870
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,360
Speaker 2:  arc that Ellie has to experience

871
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,960
Speaker 11:  Something that this episode really sort of highlights. And I think in a

872
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,640
Speaker 11:  really beautiful, subtle way, it does sort of get into how being

873
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,560
Speaker 11:  born into this fundamentally changes a person. And it's not a change

874
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,320
Speaker 11:  that any of those people themselves can perceive, but it is something

875
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:16,280
Speaker 11:  one imagines that adults like Joel and Tess could see in

876
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,120
Speaker 11:  kids like Ellie. Like, oh, you, you move through the world differently as

877
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,760
Speaker 11:  a child and we all know why and there's nothing that any of us can really

878
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,720
Speaker 11:  do to change it because there's no amount of like shielding

879
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,600
Speaker 11:  or coddling or making things relatively okay that can

880
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,600
Speaker 11:  really counterbalance growing up in the apocalypse. You know what I mean?

881
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,760
Speaker 11:  Right. Watching the show, it's difficult to understand like what the fireflies

882
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,000
Speaker 11:  are entirely, but this episode does a solid job of really conveying to you

883
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:44,160
Speaker 11:  how life is so shitty that working with the firefly seems like a

884
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,720
Speaker 11:  viable option for Riley.

885
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:49,800
Speaker 2:  And there's just enough hope, particularly in her relationship with Ellie.

886
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,400
Speaker 2:  There's just enough hope there that you, you can feel kind of the hope, but

887
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,320
Speaker 2:  always she comes back to this, this core wariness.

888
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:59,560
Speaker 11:  There's a wariness, but there's also this pragmatism, right? Yeah. Which

889
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,120
Speaker 11:  I really love. One of my least favorite tropes in post-apocalyptic fiction

890
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:07,000
Speaker 11:  is where kids wander outside of the zone. Like let's go do dangerous things.

891
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:10,760
Speaker 11:  Be a little dumbasses. Why? Why? Why would you do that? Like your existence

892
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,680
Speaker 11:  up until this point suggests to me that you don't do stupid things like

893
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,120
Speaker 11:  this. But apparently I'm wrong. But with this, because the show has really

894
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,600
Speaker 11:  established like, look, in order for the qsy to function the way they do,

895
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:24,640
Speaker 11:  runners have to be able to go outside regularly, right? Kids

896
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,880
Speaker 11:  like Ellie and Riley are growing up understanding that there are people

897
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,600
Speaker 11:  going in and out of the boundaries regularly and presumably they, you know,

898
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,720
Speaker 11:  some of them get jazzed up to do it themselves. And for it to be like, Hey,

899
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,880
Speaker 11:  do you wanna come to a, like, do you wanna come to the mall with me? Do

900
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,600
Speaker 11:  you wanna come to the mall and make the most noise possible? Again, not

901
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,680
Speaker 11:  smart, not smart at all. In the context of the episode, it does kind of

902
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,440
Speaker 11:  play like, look, I know you and I are really accustomed to being no

903
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,840
Speaker 11:  nonsense. Let's not do stupid shit, but do you just wanna do the tiniest

904
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,120
Speaker 11:  little bit of stupid shit together?

905
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,760
Speaker 2:  They just have so much fun and happiness that they accidentally wake up a

906
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,720
Speaker 2:  zombie and get bit, no,

907
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,920
Speaker 13:  No, no, no, no, no.

908
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:06,600
Speaker 11:  We don't have to see it. And that just sort of goes back to how this show

909
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,400
Speaker 11:  understands or rather, this show has really stuck to its commitment

910
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,840
Speaker 11:  to be about human emotions and not so much

911
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:18,000
Speaker 11:  the gore, the gruesomeness. I'm, I'm torn on that cuz I, I, I wrote this

912
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,720
Speaker 11:  in my review personally. I wanted to see more zombies, or rather I wanted

913
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,080
Speaker 11:  to see more fungus. They don't need to be fighting them. Like truly, if

914
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,960
Speaker 11:  I just saw Blo walking down the street cuz they get

915
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,880
Speaker 11:  around, right? They're not always fighting like, just show me chords. And

916
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,720
Speaker 11:  like a couple of them are specials zombies. But the show has

917
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,680
Speaker 11:  decided not to do that. I, I, I get it. But every time there is one

918
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,720
Speaker 11:  of these sort of like, ah, shit, I got bits. It does always hit really hard.

919
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,000
Speaker 11:  So I have to say like it's the show's doing a good job with them.

920
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:50,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's nice. I think we've had probably what, two really graphic

921
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,960
Speaker 2:  death by zombies from characters that we actually like.

922
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,440
Speaker 2:  And, and that was Cass and then Sam. And otherwise it's

923
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,480
Speaker 2:  been like doing a real kindness to just going, yeah, you've seen all these

924
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:05,400
Speaker 2:  other ones. You don't need to see this, this teenage girl turn and her friend

925
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,120
Speaker 2:  like sobbing as she has to kill her. Like we can skip that.

926
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,480
Speaker 2:  You can, you can just imagine that

927
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,360
Speaker 11:  The casual Oh yeah, she got, got too. That quality to how

928
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,760
Speaker 11:  Kathleen got gotten in just like the, the, the chaos of the

929
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,200
Speaker 11:  zombies coming outta the ground. I love that the show's just like, here's

930
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,800
Speaker 11:  a big bad that you, you need to be worried about. And then by the end it's

931
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,640
Speaker 11:  like, yeah, and then, you know, a random zombie just jumps on or would not

932
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,400
Speaker 11:  talk about her anymore.

933
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:36,440
Speaker 2:  Well speaking of, of things coming out of the ground and then everybody talking

934
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,280
Speaker 2:  about it furiously, let's, let's talk about this. Is that my segue

935
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,720
Speaker 2:  for, for Marvel and Antman and, and Marvel Fatigue?

936
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:47,760
Speaker 15:  I used to ask myself a lot of questions. Scott, you're at Ex-Con,

937
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,920
Speaker 15:  how are you an Avenger?

938
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:53,320
Speaker 2:  That doesn't make sense because Antman Quantum Media, you and I both saw

939
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,240
Speaker 2:  it. I liked it more than you did. You were like, this is fine. And I was

940
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,200
Speaker 2:  like, this is solid like BB plus. And most people do not feel

941
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:00,840
Speaker 2:  that way about it.

942
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,720
Speaker 11:  You and I have been talking about this movie for the past week and every

943
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,560
Speaker 11:  time you've come talk to me, I'm like, crayons my goodness. You know, I,

944
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,880
Speaker 11:  you know, I, you know, I don't have any space in my mind for Quantum Mania

945
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,520
Speaker 11:  anymore. And it wasn't until this weekend that I looked and saw that like

946
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,000
Speaker 11:  it's not that it's being review bombed, people just do not care for this

947
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,280
Speaker 11:  movie.

948
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:18,600
Speaker 2:  Yeah. People

949
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,320
Speaker 11:  Are passionately against anti man in the wasp quantum

950
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:26,520
Speaker 11:  mania. I get it. I get it. To a certain extent, it is not my favorite film

951
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,480
Speaker 11:  from Marvel Studios by any stretch of the imagination. Even though I don't

952
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,240
Speaker 11:  think it's Marvel's worst film. I think it is a film that is suffering from

953
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,600
Speaker 11:  when it comes out in the grand scheme of things, like if we were to

954
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:41,600
Speaker 11:  anthropomorphize Marvel films, I think that Black Widow and Quantum Mania

955
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,360
Speaker 11:  would be sitting at a table by themselves saying, wow, look at how

956
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,080
Speaker 11:  they've done us dirty.

957
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,280
Speaker 2:  Just refusing to make eye contact with all the other movies around this

958
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,200
Speaker 11:  Truly, truly, you know, Antman in the, was Quantum Mania, it is the third

959
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,120
Speaker 11:  Ant Man film. I guess finally sort of making good on like the promise of

960
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,200
Speaker 11:  the quantum realm. I went into this thinking like this is gonna be the one

961
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,520
Speaker 11:  that finally kind of, sort of tries to explain what the quantum realm is.

962
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:09,520
Speaker 11:  Is it just a waystation for time travelers? Let's find out. And

963
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:13,200
Speaker 11:  Quantum Mania says not just that, it's essentially the micro verse, right?

964
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,800
Speaker 11:  Comic book fans, I'm not gonna get into what the micro verse is, but tldr,

965
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,840
Speaker 11:  it is an entire universe, but tiny, it's

966
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,600
Speaker 16:  A secret universe beneath ours.

967
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:25,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it gets, it like moves right past the science. There's like a

968
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,760
Speaker 2:  minute of science and then it's like, no, we're just gonna go do Journey

969
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,840
Speaker 2:  to the center of the Earth, but with tons more cgi.

970
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,920
Speaker 11:  You see Journey to the center of the Earth. I see Osmosis Jones,

971
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:41,040
Speaker 11:  it's your standard Marvel film, right? We get sucked into strange

972
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,080
Speaker 11:  place where there is a villainous type

973
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,920
Speaker 11:  character who has complicated motivations, who is terrorizing people.

974
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,720
Speaker 11:  In this case it's Jonathan Majors is hanging the conqueror who is, he's

975
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,400
Speaker 11:  conquered the quantum realm. And at one point he was very good friends with

976
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,120
Speaker 11:  Janet VanDyne, Michelle Pfeiffer, who you know from the second Aunt Manon

977
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,520
Speaker 11:  movie, aunt Man in the Wasp. She got outta the quantum realm in the second

978
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,360
Speaker 11:  movie and didn't tell anybody anything about it. And this movie is like,

979
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,200
Speaker 11:  yo, Janet, what was going on down there? And all of this is, again,

980
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,480
Speaker 11:  all of this is just your, this is all very standard Marvel Fair.

981
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:18,720
Speaker 2:  I would definitely say of all of the Marvel like trilogies little

982
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,080
Speaker 2:  sections, ant Man Pound for Pound is still the

983
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:22,760
Speaker 2:  strongest

984
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:23,800
Speaker 11:  No act

985
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:27,840
Speaker 2:  Because Iron Man Two I like, I think Iron Man two is significantly

986
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:28,120
Speaker 2:  worse.

987
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:29,040
Speaker 11:  Oh it is.

988
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:32,720
Speaker 2:  And so like it drags, it drags down the Iron Man franchise

989
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:36,800
Speaker 2:  more than Quantum Mania drags down the Antman franchise

990
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,800
Speaker 11:  And the promise of Quantum mania is like one Billy Quantum

991
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,360
Speaker 11:  Mania and Multiverse Madness or two of like the better names that that Marvel

992
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:48,200
Speaker 11:  has ever had. Like oh shit, what's going on? And they've both just

993
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:51,920
Speaker 11:  under-delivered in big ways. But that's what I was saying. So the confluence

994
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,720
Speaker 11:  of factors, right? It's the third movie in a franchise, which can go either

995
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,800
Speaker 11:  way. It can be a great, like we can, you can Ragner Rocket and be like,

996
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,680
Speaker 11:  oh shit, let's revitalize things and bring everybody in. Or you can Iron

997
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,240
Speaker 11:  Man three it and sort of just kind of wrap it up, right?

998
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,160
Speaker 11:  There's that going on for it. But there's also been a gradual shift

999
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:13,080
Speaker 11:  in the way that Marvel makes movies, right? If you go back and watch the

1000
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:17,000
Speaker 11:  first Antman movie, it's set predominantly Aunt San Francisco, right? We

1001
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,160
Speaker 11:  are moving through the real, the regular human world and playing

1002
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,840
Speaker 11:  with perspective in size and ways that are comedic, right? Oh my god, Thomas

1003
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,480
Speaker 11:  a tank engine is humongous. Look at that. So crazy Scott

1004
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,160
Speaker 11:  Lang's going down a pipe. That's cool. We can all recognize what that

1005
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,320
Speaker 11:  is. You know what I mean? We can recognize what a lot of those set pieces

1006
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:39,120
Speaker 11:  were, sort of what the jokes are meant to be here in quantum mania.

1007
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,440
Speaker 11:  Everything is set in the quantum realm. And while this could have been an

1008
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,440
Speaker 11:  opportunity to explain sort of what the quantum realm is, what it does,

1009
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,040
Speaker 11:  it's literally just a big CGI fest. My impression

1010
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,920
Speaker 11:  watching this, everything looks as if it was shot on a sound stage, partially

1011
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,080
Speaker 11:  because the lighting and

1012
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,640
Speaker 2:  Also it was shot on a sound

1013
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,000
Speaker 11:  Stage. Well you, but you know what I mean? Yeah. Everything is just a lit

1014
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:01,800
Speaker 11:  so aggressively that it looks like it's a staged play, which it shouldn't,

1015
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,680
Speaker 11:  right? When you're throwing this much expensive VFX at something,

1016
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,480
Speaker 11:  right? This is a lesson that James Cameron understands very well when you're

1017
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,360
Speaker 11:  going to be that expensive, it has to look real.

1018
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:17,440
Speaker 11:  And the challenge is settling on a reality

1019
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:21,280
Speaker 11:  to sort of shoot for, right? It's not what, when we go into

1020
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:25,360
Speaker 11:  an avatar the way of water, we are not looking for shots

1021
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:29,280
Speaker 11:  of reality that gel with our own experience of Pandora cuz we

1022
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,080
Speaker 11:  haven't been there, right? We are looking for something that has

1023
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,600
Speaker 11:  determined what its reality is going to be and then done everything in its

1024
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,880
Speaker 11:  power to make that reality look organic and living in breathing

1025
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:45,080
Speaker 11:  so much so that you are tricked into thinking, oh this looks

1026
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,800
Speaker 11:  real. Right? When people say that the way water looks realistic,

1027
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,120
Speaker 11:  I think to myself point to me in the movie where it was realistic, please

1028
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,480
Speaker 11:  show me, show me, show me, show me. You may have an argument when it comes

1029
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,400
Speaker 11:  to the way that the light is refracted through the water. Sure. But

1030
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,040
Speaker 11:  everything else is sort of ridiculous. It's just that it's all working in

1031
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:07,000
Speaker 11:  concert together to create an illusion. Quantum mania. There are many, so

1032
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:11,200
Speaker 11:  this is not a spoiler cuz you've seen it in the trailer. Delaying family.

1033
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,920
Speaker 11:  Everybody right? Everybody gets sucked in the quantum realm. It's

1034
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,880
Speaker 11:  underwhelming. And part of it is because a lot of these things are difficult

1035
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,880
Speaker 11:  to, to visualize. I was thinking this, watching one of the Latter Hunger

1036
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,560
Speaker 11:  Games movies over the weekend where no one knew what they were acting

1037
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,280
Speaker 11:  against. And it, it's, you can say that it's the actor's job to be able

1038
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,000
Speaker 11:  to know, but it is hard to conjure the emotion of

1039
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,840
Speaker 11:  being in to, of being chased by a wall of black liquid or

1040
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,760
Speaker 11:  being in the quantum realm surrounded by ameba people. So everyone

1041
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,400
Speaker 11:  is doing their best job at being like, wow, there's energy

1042
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,320
Speaker 11:  spirals in the sky and yet it does not read on the screen. And I think that

1043
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:52,080
Speaker 11:  a lot of the negative reaction to this film, it stems from

1044
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:56,120
Speaker 11:  the fact that the creation of the illusion is just so subpar

1045
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:59,840
Speaker 11:  in multiple ways throughout the film that you, well, rather that

1046
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,520
Speaker 11:  audiences are just like, huh, this is the third Aunt Man movie,

1047
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,400
Speaker 11:  isn't it? Huh? No one has talked about what's going on with that

1048
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,360
Speaker 11:  eternal hand coming out the planet. Have they, I guess Marvel is kind of

1049
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:15,320
Speaker 11:  sort of entering a weird spot and not fulfilling, you know, my expectations

1050
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,680
Speaker 11:  and that's fine, but I don't think that it's fair

1051
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:21,600
Speaker 11:  entirely to blame it solely on quantum mania.

1052
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:25,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I I think, I think the fatigue is separate

1053
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:29,320
Speaker 2:  from, from this particular movie. I think like this movie, the, the

1054
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,880
Speaker 2:  flaws of this movie highlight that fatigue because people are tired of

1055
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:36,520
Speaker 2:  things with no stakes. And the stakes have gotten so

1056
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:40,080
Speaker 2:  cosmic, they've gotten so big in the Marvel

1057
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,640
Speaker 2:  universe that they've gone right back around to not having, not really having

1058
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,480
Speaker 2:  steaks. Right. They're not grounding it enough. And so they try

1059
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:51,400
Speaker 2:  to, they tried to give, like Michelle Pfeiffer, bless her heart, she is working,

1060
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,640
Speaker 2:  she's great to give this film Steaks. Yeah.

1061
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,920
Speaker 11:  Part of the issue with Quantum Man is that there are too many people in

1062
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,760
Speaker 11:  it. We have Aunt Man and the Waz cool. We have Scott's daughter,

1063
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:03,640
Speaker 11:  Cassie. Cool. We've also got the original aunt man, Hank Pam

1064
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,360
Speaker 11:  and his wife Janet VanDyne, who have drama

1065
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:10,640
Speaker 11:  with their daughter. Hope that is being addressed in this movie.

1066
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,560
Speaker 11:  And I'm sure that there's a flow chart somewhere in Marm HQ being like,

1067
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,880
Speaker 11:  here's how it's all gonna work together perfectly and synergize. And it

1068
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,440
Speaker 11:  totally could've, it just didn't hear, do I wanna see cool old man

1069
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:24,160
Speaker 11:  Michael Douglas commanding Army's events? Sure. But I also wanna see,

1070
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:28,160
Speaker 11:  and I say this in the, the Marvel branding sense, I wanna see like old woman

1071
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,520
Speaker 11:  Janet in the quantum realm, you know, shooting stuff with her blasters and

1072
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,000
Speaker 11:  the film. You can tell that the film is trying to play in all of these faces,

1073
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,880
Speaker 11:  but it can't commit to any one of them. And in doing so, a lot of the stories,

1074
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:42,560
Speaker 11:  they are all addressed and touched upon to

1075
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,400
Speaker 11:  equal levels of depth, I think, but not quite deep enough for

1076
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,080
Speaker 11:  any of them to really hit or land, which would be

1077
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:53,960
Speaker 11:  fine if this was like the second hit man movie, I kind of feel.

1078
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,880
Speaker 11:  But for the, this is the one that kicks off the next phase and this is the

1079
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,200
Speaker 11:  one where we're seeing King the conqueror in full action. It's like, all

1080
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,960
Speaker 11:  right, well let's focus on that cuz that kind of seems to me like it's important.

1081
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:05,440
Speaker 11:  No,

1082
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:09,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It, it felt like the film got kind of dragged down by the

1083
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:13,600
Speaker 2:  expectations of the o over the overarching plot. Hmm. So it felt

1084
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,880
Speaker 2:  more like when you're watching, you're watching your little show, and I'm

1085
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,240
Speaker 2:  gonna gonna refer to like the CW d c universe shows. You're watching your

1086
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,320
Speaker 2:  little show, you're having a good time, and then suddenly everything shifts

1087
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,800
Speaker 2:  because they've gotta go serve their purpose to the big crossover episode.

1088
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And it's that same feeling of like, okay, but like I was super

1089
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,600
Speaker 2:  girls that got this whole thing going on and I'm really excited about this

1090
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,360
Speaker 2:  plot, and now I gotta suddenly worry about the flash. And like, I didn't

1091
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,040
Speaker 2:  ask for that,

1092
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,680
Speaker 11:  And that's kind of how the movie's supposed to work. But it's like, at the

1093
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:44,000
Speaker 11:  beginning I'm thinking to myself like, oh no, like I'm ant man and I'm super

1094
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,120
Speaker 11:  famous and I don't know what to do with my life. And I kind of sort of don't

1095
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,160
Speaker 11:  have a relationship with my daughter. I'm like, oh, Scott Lang just, I want

1096
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,480
Speaker 11:  this. Like, give me, give me this. I, I imagine that Marvel,

1097
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,520
Speaker 11:  Kevin Figes had many a conversation about this. How do you

1098
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,640
Speaker 11:  start to see the universe with a new big bad, right? Because

1099
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,800
Speaker 11:  pre Thanos, the, the Marvel movies were just like, oh, like Thor

1100
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,840
Speaker 11:  got his hammer back. Oh, look at that Ironman, he is still alive. And then

1101
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:12,360
Speaker 11:  at one point it was just, Thanos just showed up, truly a, a purple man just

1102
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,360
Speaker 11:  showed up. It's not that he didn't make any sense, but there was no warning.

1103
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:19,080
Speaker 11:  The purple man showed up, the nerds lost their minds and Marvel said, we

1104
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,080
Speaker 11:  got 'em. Yeah. The difficulty with all these things, once you, you know,

1105
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,960
Speaker 11:  pulling off a trick once does not ensure its success again. And now

1106
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:29,840
Speaker 11:  Marvel has tried to do, Marvel has tried to do something similar by

1107
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:33,720
Speaker 11:  having a Kang variant pop up at the end of Loki. But it

1108
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,960
Speaker 11:  just hasn't quite stuck. It's like, all right, well, so what

1109
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:40,160
Speaker 2:  I don't think making King the big bad is the problem, right? Like Jonathan

1110
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,400
Speaker 2:  Majors is just killing it, but the, but they, they're trying to build, they're

1111
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,000
Speaker 2:  trying to set up a multiverse. And the thing is, we've seen a lot of multiverses

1112
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,640
Speaker 2:  at this point. Like we as audiences are familiar with them,

1113
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,800
Speaker 2:  say what you will about the CW shows it did a really good multiverse and

1114
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,440
Speaker 2:  it did it well, and it did a super entertaining job. Spider-Man into the

1115
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,320
Speaker 2:  multiverse that does a really good job of doing multiverses. And we are seeing

1116
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,280
Speaker 2:  all these, we've seen some other multiverses out there too, right? But the

1117
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:10,080
Speaker 2:  Marvel one is just weird. It's not gelling. And I think

1118
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,920
Speaker 2:  part of that is because we don't care about any of the other characters in

1119
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,680
Speaker 2:  the multiverse. They're all just like, what Cannon fodder. And then it seems

1120
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,560
Speaker 2:  to take like the impact of King diminish the impact of

1121
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,920
Speaker 2:  Kane because there's a ton of kings. So it's like, okay, which is like the

1122
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,400
Speaker 2:  big bad,

1123
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:28,320
Speaker 11:  I have said this in public before, my interest, my

1124
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:32,240
Speaker 11:  investment rather in the M C U started to diminish

1125
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,120
Speaker 11:  one's characters I like started to disappear either because the actors who

1126
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40,000
Speaker 11:  played them died or because Wanda became bad and then she left

1127
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,040
Speaker 11:  and then she died. And now I'm just kind of like, all right, well I don't

1128
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:46,640
Speaker 11:  really know why I'm here anymore. I think part of the fatigue is people

1129
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:50,600
Speaker 11:  don't like having to keep track of all of this. I think it's not that people

1130
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,480
Speaker 11:  don't want to do the work, people aren't willing to do the work, rather

1131
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,720
Speaker 11:  of watching a, a Disney plus show here seeing a movie there,

1132
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:01,120
Speaker 11:  but the expectation is that that work is going to be rewarded

1133
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,320
Speaker 11:  at some point or that there's going to be some sort of payoff to it.

1134
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:08,760
Speaker 11:  And this phase in particular right now has definitely felt

1135
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,600
Speaker 11:  like, I know that the official Marvel line is this is the multiverse saga.

1136
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,600
Speaker 11:  This feels like the holding pattern saga. Yeah. More so than anything else,

1137
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,880
Speaker 11:  right? This has felt like everybody's gotta have kids and then we're gonna

1138
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,600
Speaker 11:  have the kids set up for the future and then we're gonna introduce the next

1139
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,960
Speaker 11:  big bad and then everything can start coming together. And for like the

1140
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,440
Speaker 11:  nerdiest of nerds. Sure. But for your average

1141
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:32,440
Speaker 11:  casual fans who are just like, I wanna see the Avengers, right?

1142
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:36,280
Speaker 11:  People who expect to see a team of superheroes, they wanna get their

1143
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,960
Speaker 11:  money's worth. Like none of these solo projects, they wanna see sweeping

1144
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,720
Speaker 11:  shots of people standing back to back saving the world. We haven't quite

1145
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,440
Speaker 11:  gotten there.

1146
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:48,800
Speaker 2:  We haven't, part of that is we're seeing the scaffolding of this. We're

1147
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,760
Speaker 2:  seeing the structure of Disney creating this

1148
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:56,640
Speaker 2:  new storyline, right? Like quantum mania. I think one of the

1149
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,160
Speaker 2:  things that is probably most difficult for people is that they know they're

1150
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,800
Speaker 2:  being set up. They know that this is a set up movie. There's emotional

1151
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,360
Speaker 2:  payoff, right? We see that, that that relationship between Scott and

1152
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:11,000
Speaker 2:  Cassie take a turn and he starts to trust her as being a superhero.

1153
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:15,320
Speaker 2:  And we see hope, kind of fix things a little with her mom

1154
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,160
Speaker 2:  kinda, but for the most part it feels like, no, we're in this holding pattern

1155
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,440
Speaker 2:  and we know exactly why we're in this holding pattern because there's gonna

1156
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:26,200
Speaker 2:  be more movies and they need to save some of the plot for those movies.

1157
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,880
Speaker 2:  Whereas those first couple of phases in the Marvel universe, those

1158
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,640
Speaker 2:  didn't feel like we're getting the band together. But hold up a second cuz

1159
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,560
Speaker 2:  we gotta make sure everybody's contracts are signed and we're good to go.

1160
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,440
Speaker 2:  Those first ones were just like, oh wow, look at all these characters and

1161
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,040
Speaker 2:  now they're all coming together, this is crazy. And like the Guardians of

1162
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,840
Speaker 2:  the Galaxy are here, what do they do? This is wild. And now it's like,

1163
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,360
Speaker 2:  okay, most of these other ones, by the end of the film, people have not grown

1164
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,960
Speaker 2:  or they've grown and then are abruptly murdered.

1165
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:56,080
Speaker 11:  Right? Or they're pulled into space for space tribunal and

1166
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,080
Speaker 11:  it's like, okay, sure. I guess we'll see that in seven years.

1167
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And, and it's just, it's, I, I get why people are fatigued,

1168
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,480
Speaker 2:  especially if you didn't, if you haven't had to already do all of this reading

1169
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,880
Speaker 2:  comic books, like a lot you, you and I were like, it's a little tiring, but

1170
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,680
Speaker 2:  we've been doing this for years because we read comic books and this is how

1171
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:16,600
Speaker 2:  comic books handle big stories and it's really irritating and we hate

1172
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,840
Speaker 2:  it. And marvel's like, yeah, it is really irritating and you do hate it,

1173
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,480
Speaker 2:  but it sells comics. So we're gonna do the exact same thing for films.

1174
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:26,840
Speaker 11:  But you saying earlier about the scaffolding, I think that's so interesting

1175
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:30,320
Speaker 11:  because you're right, like thinking back to I like what is the, the most

1176
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,520
Speaker 11:  interesting thing that Marvel has put out recently or the thing that's like

1177
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,360
Speaker 11:  lit me up the most? And I think the, when we're talking about the MCU

1178
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,280
Speaker 11:  proper, I'm still kind of stuck on Miss Marvel, right? Because it

1179
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,880
Speaker 11:  was, it just felt really fresh and sort of really new for the space. But

1180
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,680
Speaker 11:  in that last episode, when you hear the theme

1181
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:52,440
Speaker 11:  song from the X-Men playing, it's so interesting because at one point in

1182
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,400
Speaker 11:  time that would've just been like a haha, the X-men are showing up, you

1183
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,680
Speaker 11:  guys get excited

1184
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:59,760
Speaker 2:  An Easter egg, and you're like, oh, nice.

1185
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:03,760
Speaker 11:  Yeah. And now it's like Kamala's a mutant, what does this mean for everybody?

1186
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,040
Speaker 11:  When are the X-men coming up? How is Kamala gonna become a part of them?

1187
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:11,000
Speaker 11:  And part of that is it's our own fault, right? For

1188
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,960
Speaker 11:  being the speculative rumor hungry nerds that we are. But

1189
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,400
Speaker 11:  the studios play into it now, right? Like it's very much intentional

1190
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:22,200
Speaker 11:  and it has the unintended consequence of making everything

1191
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:26,120
Speaker 11:  sort of feel inconsent not inconsequential, but when

1192
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:29,760
Speaker 11:  you have your focus so firmly fixed on the future, the present doesn't mean

1193
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,600
Speaker 11:  quite as much, right? So thinking to myself, I'm still stuck on,

1194
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,960
Speaker 11:  is Kamala a mutant? We have a poster for the marbles, they're all going

1195
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,840
Speaker 11:  to space together and she's got a new costume. And I'm thinking to myself,

1196
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,720
Speaker 11:  what's going on with your genetic makeup? Right? And I think,

1197
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:47,560
Speaker 11:  I think on that, like that's, that's, that's, that's good synergy to a certain

1198
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,440
Speaker 11:  extent, but I think that it's not always ideal

1199
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,200
Speaker 11:  because you are sort of keeping your eye on the horizon. So the entire time

1200
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:59,320
Speaker 11:  watching Quantum mania, to your point to set a movie, I'm thinking, well,

1201
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,360
Speaker 11:  the Kang dynasty is competent. It's coming, right? No matter how this movie

1202
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,280
Speaker 11:  ends, I know that Kang, one of them is going to succeed

1203
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:10,120
Speaker 11:  in some way that necessitates the Avengers teaming up to

1204
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:13,320
Speaker 11:  try to take him down. And that's definitely an exciting

1205
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,840
Speaker 11:  prospect for me, Kang fan. But for me, person

1206
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,120
Speaker 11:  who was trying to give Scott Lang another try, I'm like, all right, Scott Lang,

1207
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,920
Speaker 11:  show me what you got. But I looked up my watch a couple of times while I

1208
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,200
Speaker 11:  was watching the movie. I'm not gonna lie.

1209
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:29,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I, I did too. And I, I would give it a, I'd still

1210
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:33,200
Speaker 2:  give the movie a solid beat, but that is because I just love whenever somebody

1211
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:37,160
Speaker 2:  goes to brand a new planet and sees a MEbA people. Well,
