00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:06,365
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the many, many

3
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:10,245
Speaker 2:  definitions of electronic paper. I'm your friend David Pierce and I am

4
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:14,205
Speaker 2:  at the park for research and journalism as you do. So, I have this

5
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:18,245
Speaker 2:  new device, it's called the Daylight DC one and it's a tablet

6
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:22,205
Speaker 2:  obviously, but the idea is that it's a different kind of tablet.

7
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:26,245
Speaker 2:  It doesn't use a big, bright, colorful screen like the iPad, but

8
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:29,965
Speaker 2:  it's also not an E Ink screen, which has sort of slow refresh rate and doesn't

9
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:33,365
Speaker 2:  have some of the things that you want from like a smoothly scrolling, easy

10
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:37,165
Speaker 2:  typing tablet. It tries to be a middle ground and I find that middle

11
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:40,365
Speaker 2:  ground really interesting. I've been using this tablet a lot. They really

12
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:44,125
Speaker 2:  want you to use it outdoors. It's called the Daylight. It comes in this

13
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:48,045
Speaker 2:  like plush sort of outdoorsy case instead of like

14
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:51,765
Speaker 2:  the sleek metallic fabricy thing you normally get with a tablet. And

15
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:56,125
Speaker 2:  it's designed to just be a simpler kind of technology. And I have

16
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,605
Speaker 2:  a lot of testing lifts to do with this thing, but so far it's not that impressive

17
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:02,245
Speaker 2:  a gadget. But I still find it fascinating 'cause I think this idea that what

18
00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:06,205
Speaker 2:  if instead of totally, you know, ground up, reinventing every kind of

19
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:10,165
Speaker 2:  gadget that exists in the world, we just tweaked the formula a little

20
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:13,165
Speaker 2:  bit. Different kinds of screens, different sizes, different shapes, different

21
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:17,285
Speaker 2:  fabrics, different textures. And maybe that changes the way that we'll feel

22
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,405
Speaker 2:  about these things and the way that we use them in more interesting ways

23
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:23,765
Speaker 2:  than just, you know, throw it all away and try again. To some extent. That

24
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:26,485
Speaker 2:  is actually what we're gonna talk about in this episode. First, we're gonna

25
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:30,165
Speaker 2:  talk about an e ink device called the Book's Palmer that I'm sort of

26
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:33,965
Speaker 2:  obsessed with. We'll talk about why in a few minutes after that we're gonna

27
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:37,765
Speaker 2:  talk about the new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro from Microsoft, which are

28
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,645
Speaker 2:  still very gadgety gadgets, but they're making this big bet that AI

29
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:45,605
Speaker 2:  and a new kind of chip from Qualcomm can change how you feel about

30
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,285
Speaker 2:  something that still looks like a tablet and still looks like a laptop, but

31
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:51,725
Speaker 2:  might mean something else to you. It's very gadgety episode, but it's also

32
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:54,845
Speaker 2:  I think gonna get strangely philosophical in spots. I'm very excited about

33
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:58,045
Speaker 2:  it. We also have a question new from the hotline. Lots to get to. All that

34
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:01,085
Speaker 2:  is coming up in just a second, but I have never played pickleball before

35
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:04,445
Speaker 2:  and those people are playing pickleball. I'm gonna go learn how to play pickleball.

36
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:06,125
Speaker 2:  This is The Vergecast. We'll see you in a sec.

37
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:24,125
Speaker 2:  is like the world's best problem to have by

38
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:08,165
Speaker 2:  is an E Ink screen. The EIN Carta 1200 if you're really curious,

39
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:11,925
Speaker 2:  which makes the Palma kind of the exact middle between a smartphone

40
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:16,085
Speaker 2:  and a Kindle. And for me that turns out to be kind of perfect.

41
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:20,325
Speaker 2:  The Palmer launched last fall and I remember being sort of interested in

42
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:23,925
Speaker 2:  it back then. Books the company, it's BOOX by the way,

43
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:28,005
Speaker 2:  has been making these interesting EIN Android devices for a while and they

44
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:31,605
Speaker 2:  started out kind of clunky but have steadily gotten better over time. The

45
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,485
Speaker 2:  Palmer launched last fall and I remember being sort of interested in it back

46
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:39,125
Speaker 2:  then. Books the company, it's BOOX by the way,

47
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:43,285
Speaker 2:  has been making these interesting EIN Android devices for a while and they

48
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:47,045
Speaker 2:  started kind of clunky but have steadily gotten better over time. It's a

49
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:50,325
Speaker 2:  China-based company and it sells like a million different devices.

50
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:54,605
Speaker 2:  There's the books note Air three C and the books tab Ultra and the books

51
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:57,605
Speaker 2:  page and the books Leaf and the books Leaf two and the books note Air two

52
00:04:57,745 --> 00:05:01,445
Speaker 2:  and the books go and the books go color. Basically every size of

53
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:05,365
Speaker 2:  e-reader, You can imagine You can get. I already have a lot of

54
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:08,925
Speaker 2:  E-readers though I read a lot on my iPad. I have a couple of

55
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:12,685
Speaker 2:  Kindles of various sizes and generations. I have a remarkable tablet

56
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:16,405
Speaker 2:  that I really like. I'm honestly good on E Ink devices. The

57
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:20,365
Speaker 2:  Palmer is also $280, which is a lot for an e-reader. But

58
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:23,365
Speaker 2:  I ended up getting one anyway because over the months since it launched I've

59
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,725
Speaker 2:  seen a surprising number of people talk about how much they love this thing.

60
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:30,445
Speaker 2:  So I got mine a couple of months ago and I have to say I understood the appeal

61
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:33,765
Speaker 2:  pretty much right away. For me, there are two things about the Palmer that

62
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:37,365
Speaker 2:  have actually made it stick in my life. The first is just the size. The fact

63
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:41,285
Speaker 2:  that it fits in my pocket and is really easy to hold in one hand is a

64
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:44,445
Speaker 2:  total game changer. That sounds sort of ridiculous to say, but it's really

65
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:48,365
Speaker 2:  been true. It's easier for reading in bed, it's easier to bring with me

66
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:52,205
Speaker 2:  on a walk or to a coffee shop. I can lug the Palmer the same way I lug

67
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:55,725
Speaker 2:  my phone and that has just made me have it around more often. The second

68
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:59,405
Speaker 2:  thing is the fact that it runs Android, which I mean obviously, right? That's

69
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:02,925
Speaker 2:  like the whole book's thing. Instead of just having to do everything through

70
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:06,765
Speaker 2:  Amazon on a Kindle or through Barnes and Noble on a nook, you get the whole

71
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:10,405
Speaker 2:  universe of Android stuff. For me as a reader, that means I can have three

72
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:13,765
Speaker 2:  crucial things on the device at the same time. The place I read books, which

73
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:17,045
Speaker 2:  happens to be the Kindle app, the place I read articles, which is an app

74
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:20,925
Speaker 2:  called Read Wise Reader and the place that I save webpages and other links

75
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:24,645
Speaker 2:  to get to later, which is an app called Raindrop. All of my reading, no matter

76
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:28,005
Speaker 2:  what form it takes now lives on this one device with an e Ink screen.

77
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:31,285
Speaker 2:  Any app with pagination You can scroll with the volume buttons on the side,

78
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:34,845
Speaker 2:  which I really love. The battery lasts a long time, somewhere between like

79
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:38,125
Speaker 2:  a few days and a week depending on how I use it. I'm not distracted by other

80
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,365
Speaker 2:  stuff because I don't have any other stuff because TikTok and YouTube all

81
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:45,125
Speaker 2:  really suck on an Ian screen. It's just perfect. I did also

82
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,445
Speaker 2:  install Pocket Casts and Spotify, which are where I listen to podcasts and

83
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:52,405
Speaker 2:  music. So now this thing is both my Kindle and my iPod, I

84
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:55,885
Speaker 2:  go online to download new stuff, then I put the thing in airplane mode and

85
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:59,405
Speaker 2:  I'm good to go anyway. I sound like I'm shilling for the books Palmer and

86
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:02,725
Speaker 2:  I kind of am. I love this thing, but it's not because this is some

87
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:06,845
Speaker 2:  magnificently perfect unique gadget. It's kind of flimsy. I wish the screen

88
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:10,285
Speaker 2:  were higher res. I wish it supported a stylist. It's pretty slow even when

89
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:13,845
Speaker 2:  you're just trying to get to the home screen. And most problematically by

90
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:17,765
Speaker 2:  far it's running Android 11, which is now four years old and I am

91
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:21,445
Speaker 2:  deeply worried it's never going to get updated past that. The upside of Kindle

92
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:25,205
Speaker 2:  is that my Kindle from whatever six years ago still works great.

93
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:28,485
Speaker 2:  There are lots of things about the palm ads that I wish were better and very

94
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:32,045
Speaker 2:  little about it actually that someone else couldn't do better. But that's

95
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:35,445
Speaker 2:  actually what's been so fun about using this thing. It has totally proven

96
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:38,925
Speaker 2:  to me that there is something in this hardware combination, an e ink display

97
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:42,845
Speaker 2:  in the body of a smartphone with all the apps I need. That's it. It's worse

98
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:46,725
Speaker 2:  than my phone at a lot of things, but massively better than my phone in

99
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:50,445
Speaker 2:  just enough ways that it's worth having around. I've spent a lot of time

100
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:54,285
Speaker 2:  testing out new kinds of gadgets this year. Smart glasses and AI pins

101
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:58,165
Speaker 2:  and foldable devices and weird new ideas about tablets. And

102
00:07:58,265 --> 00:08:01,965
Speaker 2:  as it turns out the thing I like the most is just a new take on the smartphone.

103
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:05,445
Speaker 2:  Anyway, I wanted to know what other people liked about the Palmer and why

104
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:08,685
Speaker 2:  this thing has been such a hit with people who have tried it. So I called

105
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:11,605
Speaker 2:  up a couple of them to chat about it. The first person I called was Matt

106
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:14,845
Speaker 2:  Martin. He runs a company called Clockwise and I actually caught him a few

107
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:18,165
Speaker 2:  weeks into parental leave. He said he found the Palma the same way I did

108
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,165
Speaker 2:  because people just wouldn't stop talking about it.

109
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:24,285
Speaker 6:  People in my feed that that really loved good products, good design seemed

110
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:27,725
Speaker 6:  like hit the zeitgeist somehow in like the little tech world that we live

111
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:31,605
Speaker 6:  in. I also am having a new kid and I was like, well I aspire

112
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:35,405
Speaker 6:  to read more. I aspire not to, you know, spend my 30 minutes

113
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:38,965
Speaker 6:  before bed on. Sure. You know, Instagram reels. And so

114
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:43,285
Speaker 6:  I got it and I have to tell you, like the thing that I find really

115
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:47,325
Speaker 6:  quite compelling about it, even after using it for a month or so, is

116
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:51,245
Speaker 6:  having a full OS on it. Like the Kindle, you're in Amazon's

117
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:54,925
Speaker 6:  little world where, you know it's the Kindle operating system running on

118
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:58,325
Speaker 6:  top of Android, but you know, you only have access to what Amazon gives you.

119
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:02,525
Speaker 6:  It is basically a full version of Android. You can go to the Google Play

120
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:06,045
Speaker 6:  store. I downloaded the New York Times app, I downloaded instant paper,

121
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:09,925
Speaker 6:  I downloaded Libby and I downloaded the Kindle app, which by the way makes

122
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:13,805
Speaker 6:  for just as good a reading experiences on a Kindle. And that's actually,

123
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:17,445
Speaker 6:  it's the combination of the portability and being able to like flip through

124
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:21,325
Speaker 6:  online articles that are cultivated in the New York Times and actually flip

125
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:24,885
Speaker 6:  through things. It's actually pretty, I wouldn't say it's revolutionary,

126
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:28,645
Speaker 6:  but it's, it's an evolution that transforms the device for me to make it

127
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:30,805
Speaker 6:  pretty compelling and something I reach for.

128
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:35,285
Speaker 2:  I totally agree. The argument I have heard against this device is

129
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:38,805
Speaker 2:  basically like, just download those apps onto your phone.

130
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:42,285
Speaker 2:  You do this. Like what is the point of having a whole separate dedicated

131
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:45,805
Speaker 2:  device just for this? And I think to some extent

132
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:49,445
Speaker 2:  the answer is like, Inc is nicer to look at. Right? But it also feels like

133
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:53,325
Speaker 2:  there's some, there's something about having a thing that feels like a

134
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:57,005
Speaker 2:  dedicated device. Yeah. Even though it's not a totally dedicated device

135
00:09:57,195 --> 00:10:01,005
Speaker 2:  that it's like I could put all the stuff I don't wanna look at on the

136
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:04,965
Speaker 2:  Palmer and for some reason I haven't and I don't feel tempted to, there is

137
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:08,005
Speaker 2:  a web browser and no part of me is tempted to go look at the web browser.

138
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I like, I have a hard time figuring out why that is.

139
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:15,445
Speaker 6:  So I am addicted to New York Times little games. Mm. I play with

140
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:18,605
Speaker 6:  friends and I, and I was like, oh I can play connections on here. Even that

141
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:22,565
Speaker 6:  I find not compelling to do. Like if it's outside of reading, I

142
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:25,725
Speaker 6:  don't really want to do it on the Palm. I, and I think that the, the answer

143
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:29,805
Speaker 6:  is probably not a very exciting one, which is that you know,

144
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:33,285
Speaker 6:  as humans, you know there's the old anecdote that we were probably all taught

145
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:37,165
Speaker 6:  in Psych 1 0 1, which is that physical environment matters. Yeah. Like

146
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:40,805
Speaker 6:  if you set up an environment for a specific context, your brain actually

147
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:43,925
Speaker 6:  is kind of hardwired to take in the context and get prepared for that. And

148
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:47,725
Speaker 6:  I think a separate device matters here a bit like if I'm in the context of

149
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:51,605
Speaker 6:  my phone, there's just like that muscle memory like, you know, iOS

150
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:55,165
Speaker 6:  has become so refined at getting between the applications so quickly.

151
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:59,325
Speaker 6:  Like I can have a random thought and this happens all the time. Like sometimes

152
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,365
Speaker 6:  you're reading, you're in a slow section, you have that random thought about

153
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:06,085
Speaker 6:  like, oh what was that thing that I wanted to buy on Amazon?

154
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:09,645
Speaker 6:  And you were there without even thinking about it. And now I'm on like a

155
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:12,605
Speaker 6:  rabbit hole of attention that I didn't mean to be on.

156
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:16,125
Speaker 2:  This is part of the reason I've been so interested in this gadget ecosystem

157
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:20,045
Speaker 2:  for so long is I think anybody who says, oh just use your smartphone differently.

158
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:22,525
Speaker 2:  It's a matter of willpower is just like, no

159
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:27,685
Speaker 2:  you're wrong. And that's not how it works. Yeah. And also I don't, my phone

160
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:30,125
Speaker 2:  is very good at a lot of things and I'm happy it's good at those things.

161
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:33,245
Speaker 2:  So what, give me the full list of the apps you have on there. You mentioned

162
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:35,485
Speaker 2:  Kindle, New York Times, what else do you have? That's

163
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:39,205
Speaker 6:  Basically it, man. I mean, so it was kind of wild. I realized when I was

164
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:42,645
Speaker 6:  logging in everything that I could install one password and like it would

165
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:46,125
Speaker 6:  just work. Oh that's smart integrated. Which is, you know, it's a full and

166
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:49,765
Speaker 6:  solid Android. So I have in addition to those, I have one password

167
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:53,685
Speaker 6:  Audible Wikipedia, but I really, the home screen is just four

168
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:57,605
Speaker 6:  apps. It's just Kindle piece paper or New York Times and Lib.

169
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:01,485
Speaker 6:  'cause again, it's a dedicated device for me. I don't really even seek out

170
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:04,565
Speaker 6:  the other applications. You said, like you said, there's a web browser and

171
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:07,645
Speaker 6:  I don't, I don't really have any impulse to go use that.

172
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:12,125
Speaker 2:  Do you wish there were things this thing could do that it doesn't? What do

173
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,245
Speaker 2:  you dislike about the Palmer?

174
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:17,245
Speaker 6:  Not yet. Honestly, I'm, I'm very happy with it so I'll ask her to all this

175
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:20,645
Speaker 6:  which is like, look, let's just acknowledge that we're weirdos. I, I wouldn't

176
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:23,685
Speaker 6:  scream for the mountaintops that everybody should go get a books Palmer.

177
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:27,525
Speaker 6:  Sure. Like my mom would probably love this thing, but also she probably

178
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:31,285
Speaker 6:  shouldn't get one. Like it's fine. And I'm also not like, I don't

179
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:35,085
Speaker 6:  quite nerd out despite my profession being in a company that focuses

180
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:38,565
Speaker 6:  on focus time and helping give people more time in their day. I actually

181
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:42,045
Speaker 6:  don't geek out on like all these different apps that try to, you know, give

182
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:46,005
Speaker 6:  you more time to focus or prune your little garden when you're trying to

183
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:49,965
Speaker 6:  focus your elements. But I just find the thing compelling because it helps

184
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:53,565
Speaker 6:  me read like that's it. Full stop. Full story. Yeah, I was at a

185
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,005
Speaker 6:  pediatrics appointment and I stuck in my pocket 'cause I knew we'd be waiting

186
00:12:57,005 --> 00:13:00,405
Speaker 6:  around and I was sitting there and I pulled it out and read an article that

187
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:03,125
Speaker 6:  I'd saved instead of pulling out my phone and looking at some dumb crap on

188
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:07,005
Speaker 6:  Instagram and like, I don't know, small win but kind of feels good

189
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:12,005
Speaker 2:  The way Matt put that was something I've been thinking about a lot ever since.

190
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:16,045
Speaker 2:  When I have my phone in my pocket, my impulse when I pull it out is to open

191
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,965
Speaker 2:  Threads or TikTok or Instagram. I can fight that impulse and

192
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,005
Speaker 2:  be productive and do the thing that I wanted to do, but that's still the

193
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:26,685
Speaker 2:  impulse. When I have something like the Palmer in my pocket, I open it up

194
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:29,885
Speaker 2:  and my impulse is to open up Read Wise or the Crosswords app. It just

195
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:33,485
Speaker 2:  incentivizes a different kind of behavior in a way that I really like.

196
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:37,525
Speaker 2:  After I talked to Matt, the next person I called is probably the single person

197
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:40,885
Speaker 2:  most responsible for all the other people in my threads feed. Talking about

198
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:42,325
Speaker 2:  the Palmer, it's this guy,

199
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:46,485
Speaker 7:  I'm Craig Mod and I'm a writer and photographer and I make books.

200
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:50,445
Speaker 2:  Craig wrote a blog post in early May about why he loves The Palmer, which

201
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:53,645
Speaker 2:  got a lot of people excited. Craig has been thinking and writing about digital

202
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:57,365
Speaker 2:  reading for a really long time. So for him to love a reading device

203
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,845
Speaker 2:  is a pretty meaningful thing actually. Especially because as he told me,

204
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:04,965
Speaker 2:  he never expected to love a digital reading device ever again.

205
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:05,525
Speaker 2:  Oh.

206
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:07,725
Speaker 7:  I totally stopped helping for the best a long time ago. Okay. That's why

207
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:10,605
Speaker 7:  I stopped writing about it. That's why I stopped talking to companies that

208
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:12,925
Speaker 7:  would like, you know, people would email me, be like, Hey, I'm doing a startup

209
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:16,405
Speaker 7:  around digital books. It's like instantly into the trash. Like no. They're

210
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:16,725
Speaker 7:  like, yeah,

211
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:17,205
Speaker 2:  Good luck with that.

212
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:19,045
Speaker 7:  I know how that song ends. Earlier

213
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:22,565
Speaker 2:  This year though, the folks that read Wise called up Craig to talk to him

214
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:25,965
Speaker 2:  about some digital reading stuff. He's actually an advisor to the company

215
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:29,285
Speaker 2:  these days, but he also does just like the app and so do I. It's very good.

216
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:33,045
Speaker 2:  And they ended up showing him the Palmer. He bought one along with one of

217
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:36,525
Speaker 2:  the other larger books tablets and immediately fell in love with it.

218
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,445
Speaker 2:  So we compared notes for a little while.

219
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:42,925
Speaker 7:  I'm excited about this idea that Ian screens are cheap enough

220
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:47,125
Speaker 7:  that anyone can kind of produce these devices now and Android as

221
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:50,565
Speaker 7:  an operating system and you know, in general touch base tablet operating

222
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:53,765
Speaker 7:  systems, like whatever, we've figured 'em out. We figured 'em out a long

223
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:57,485
Speaker 7:  time ago. There's no cancer to be solved in

224
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:01,325
Speaker 7:  tablets anymore. It all works the same. They're all, they're all fine. And

225
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:04,325
Speaker 7:  so like Android is totally good enough. So like the fact that You can kind

226
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:08,285
Speaker 7:  of stick an Android computer into a device that has a great ink screen

227
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:12,565
Speaker 7:  and run the Kindle app. Which by the way, Kindle devices are just

228
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:13,165
Speaker 7:  Android devices.

229
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:14,245
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah, that's true.

230
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:17,885
Speaker 7:  They're just running the Kindle app and that's all they run. And the books

231
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:21,885
Speaker 7:  folks runs every Android app in the app store runs the Read Wise Reader

232
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:25,405
Speaker 7:  app. So suddenly you have all your long form reading

233
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:29,325
Speaker 7:  beautifully synced between all your devices. The Read Wise Reader app is,

234
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,965
Speaker 7:  is actually really thoughtfully done. The scroll design that they released

235
00:15:32,995 --> 00:15:33,965
Speaker 7:  earlier this year.

236
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,645
Speaker 2:  Do you do the paginated scroll?

237
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:38,325
Speaker 7:  Yes, yes. And I love it. I think it's so good.

238
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:42,285
Speaker 2:  I turned that on the second they launched it and I, yeah, it was, I have

239
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:46,045
Speaker 2:  switched to and from Instapaper a hundred thousand times

240
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:50,605
Speaker 2:  just because it Paginates. Yeah. And I don't, especially for very long

241
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:54,285
Speaker 2:  things, I just don't wanna scroll it like a webpage. No. I told the Read

242
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:57,805
Speaker 2:  Rise folks like a year ago, like, please dear God, just give me pagination.

243
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:59,925
Speaker 2:  And they were like, I don't know, I'm not sure anybody except you wants that.

244
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,805
Speaker 2:  And I was like, all right, fair enough. Understood. And then they launched

245
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:05,205
Speaker 2:  it and it was instantly, everything about my reading life got better.

246
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:08,725
Speaker 7:  Yeah, no and it, they did a really good job with it and I love how they do

247
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:12,525
Speaker 7:  the breaks and with like the book's, Palma You can set the volume

248
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:16,285
Speaker 7:  buttons as the scroll buttons and it's just perfect. One-handed reading

249
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:20,085
Speaker 7:  and there is something, you're absolutely right, scrolling and reading long

250
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:24,125
Speaker 7:  texts sucks. It sucks. And this is one of the reasons why I think if

251
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:28,085
Speaker 7:  you looked at engagement on laptop screens, like long text, I can't

252
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:31,565
Speaker 7:  read something over a thousand words on a laptop. I just can't do it. And

253
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:34,205
Speaker 7:  so I've given up on it so everything gets sent to reader. You know, you just

254
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:37,965
Speaker 7:  click the little icon, you know, in your extensions bar and Chrome or whatever

255
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:41,685
Speaker 7:  and boom, it's in reader read Wise Reader and you know, it's on

256
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:45,725
Speaker 7:  all these devices waiting to be read beautifully. Paginated You can do

257
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:49,605
Speaker 7:  note taking, highlighting synced beautifully. It goes into obsidian, the

258
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:52,725
Speaker 7:  obsidian synced notes. You can see them, you click on 'em, it opens a read

259
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:56,405
Speaker 7:  wise reader on the web. All the loops are closed for engagement around

260
00:16:56,405 --> 00:17:00,085
Speaker 7:  longform reading. And I have found since getting these devices, because

261
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,525
Speaker 7:  I used to send long form articles to the Kindle, but it was such a clumsy

262
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:07,365
Speaker 7:  affair and the notes weren't really synced and saved and it just felt like

263
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:10,045
Speaker 7:  I was throwing things away and I'd never be able to go back to them. And

264
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:13,645
Speaker 7:  the, and the archive was bad. Now that I can use Read Wise Reader and I have

265
00:17:13,645 --> 00:17:17,325
Speaker 7:  an E Ink device that has essentially a week long, two week long battery life,

266
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:21,245
Speaker 7:  I never think about charging these things. Even now it's like 44%. I've been

267
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:25,165
Speaker 7:  using this for the last week and now that I can do that, that ecosystem has

268
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:28,685
Speaker 7:  completely reinvigorated all of my digital reading and long form reading.

269
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,925
Speaker 7:  I've read more long form articles in the last three months than I have probably

270
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,765
Speaker 7:  in the last year. And that's awesome. I just love it I love it. I love that

271
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:40,005
Speaker 7:  everything that the Kindle had a monopoly on, which was mainly hardware and

272
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:43,605
Speaker 7:  screens that's gone. The moat is totally gone

273
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:47,885
Speaker 7:  and it feels like we are at this now at this precipice, high refresh

274
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:52,005
Speaker 7:  ink screens, low cost Android devices. Let's go

275
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:55,125
Speaker 7:  like, let's do something interesting around this space. Like it's just really

276
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:55,525
Speaker 7:  exciting.

277
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,725
Speaker 2:  What is it about the Palma in particular that sort of speaks to you?

278
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:02,365
Speaker 7:  Well it's You can just have it in your pocket. This is one of the things

279
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:06,085
Speaker 7:  that drove me insane about the Oasis is like, I like the oasis. The shape

280
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,685
Speaker 7:  of it is shaped so it can't fit in any pocket known to man.

281
00:18:10,435 --> 00:18:14,365
Speaker 7:  It's the craziest shape I've ever seen in my life. It doesn't fit into

282
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:17,165
Speaker 7:  any pocket. I don't know how they did it. They like, it's like they went

283
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:19,245
Speaker 7:  around the world and they checked every pocket and they're like, okay, make

284
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:23,045
Speaker 7:  it one millimeter bigger than every single angle. Well you know, so this,

285
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:26,925
Speaker 7:  you know, this Palma I'm holding right now, it's so light, it

286
00:18:27,195 --> 00:18:30,005
Speaker 7:  fits anywhere. You can just have it in your breast pocket. You can have it

287
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:33,885
Speaker 7:  in your pant pocket, whatever. So it is my like go-to thing to have on

288
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:37,285
Speaker 7:  trains. Whenever I'm traveling I pull this thing out and I'm reading on it.

289
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:41,085
Speaker 7:  It's also my bedtime computer, you know, it's like You can be in bed, all

290
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:44,565
Speaker 7:  the lights are off the, all the back lights stuff on these books. Devices

291
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,245
Speaker 7:  are pretty well done. It's kind of like a, I dunno if it's a warm back light,

292
00:18:48,245 --> 00:18:50,925
Speaker 7:  but it's like You can have it low enough or it doesn't really feel like it's

293
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:54,605
Speaker 7:  affecting sleep. It's just perfect. One-handed, it's not heavy. It's not

294
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:57,805
Speaker 7:  gonna fall on your face in a weird way. You can be on your side. You got

295
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:00,165
Speaker 7:  it in your hand with your thumb on the, the volume controls and You can just

296
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:04,285
Speaker 7:  easily go through an article until you fall asleep. It's like a gentle lullaby

297
00:19:04,585 --> 00:19:08,445
Speaker 7:  of a reader. It's great. and it makes you wonder why hasn't someone

298
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,965
Speaker 7:  made an E Ink phone? Because yes, it's, so

299
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,005
Speaker 7:  everything that I'm looking for in a device is like these palm, this, the

300
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:18,245
Speaker 7:  palm of the refresh rate is high enough. I mean, have you watched video on

301
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:22,205
Speaker 7:  these things? It's really wild. Like it disincentivizes you

302
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:25,565
Speaker 7:  from watching video, but the fact that this E Inc screen can update fast

303
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:29,005
Speaker 7:  enough to show you video and it looks like video. Yeah. and it doesn't have

304
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,685
Speaker 7:  that much ghosting. That just means that You can do highly

305
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:36,485
Speaker 7:  interactive interfaces that wouldn't be annoying to type messages on. Do

306
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:40,085
Speaker 7:  the basics. You could run Google Maps on this thing and Zoom and do searches

307
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:44,205
Speaker 7:  and it would be fine. And I would love to have this as my

308
00:19:44,205 --> 00:19:48,125
Speaker 7:  main driver so much more than, you know, the Dopamine Casino

309
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:51,685
Speaker 7:  iPhone where it's like vying for your attention every two seconds and all

310
00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:55,245
Speaker 7:  the notifications look so good and it's just such a juicy device to be spending

311
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:58,925
Speaker 7:  time with. But this Palma, it really has

312
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,765
Speaker 7:  reconfigured like, 'cause I hadn't been paying attention to the state of

313
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:06,445
Speaker 7:  E Ink and so, you know, the state of ink for me was whatever the latest Kindle

314
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:09,605
Speaker 7:  was doing. And you know, you don't really get a sense of how good it is with

315
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:13,525
Speaker 7:  the Kindles and these books. Devices have really blown my mind just how

316
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:17,405
Speaker 7:  fast E Ink can be and how joyful it is

317
00:20:17,545 --> 00:20:19,285
Speaker 7:  to run all these different apps in the Inc.

318
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:22,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah. What do you do on the Palmer other than read?

319
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:25,885
Speaker 7:  That's it. So that's, I mean that's the other great, all I, all I run is

320
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:29,525
Speaker 7:  reader and Kindle, but I've, you know, poked around on the, if I need to

321
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:33,365
Speaker 7:  do a web search, which I very rarely do, but if I need to, I can. And if

322
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,565
Speaker 7:  I need to buy a Kindle book, I can go to the Kindle website and run that.

323
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:40,485
Speaker 7:  And like the fact that I can do that and it doesn't feel like a burden

324
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:43,525
Speaker 7:  or like I'm taxing the machine, you know? Whereas like on the Kindle, anytime

325
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:47,245
Speaker 7:  you had to load up the experimental, the experimental now like

326
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:49,325
Speaker 7:  14 years later, still experimental browser

327
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:50,045
Speaker 2:  Disaster

328
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:53,925
Speaker 7:  Doesn't work. Doesn't work well at all. Yeah, no, absolutely terrible. Yeah.

329
00:20:53,925 --> 00:20:57,765
Speaker 7:  It's just made me go, wow, there's a whole world of e Inc exploration that

330
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:01,445
Speaker 7:  hasn't happened and can happen now. And the, the technology is clearly like

331
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:05,045
Speaker 7:  the IP is, I think there's a lot of IP issues or whatever. It's exp it was

332
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:08,605
Speaker 7:  expensive to license before. Maybe that's all changed. Yeah. And yeah, and

333
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:12,445
Speaker 7:  now You can make things like this, which is incredible. I love it more, more

334
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:13,045
Speaker 7:  Ink please.

335
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:17,045
Speaker 2:  I agree. And I actually think the, what you said though, like if you need

336
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:20,085
Speaker 2:  to You can, to me it's like the perfect description of everything about the

337
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:23,725
Speaker 2:  Palma because like, yes, You can watch video, but it sucks. Like it's not,

338
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:27,165
Speaker 2:  you wouldn't wanna sit and watch a video, but ultimately it's like if I need

339
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:30,885
Speaker 2:  to watch a video in service of the thing that I'm reading for a minute, it's

340
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:33,245
Speaker 2:  there. I will get through it, I will get the thing that I need out of it

341
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:36,485
Speaker 2:  and then I'll go back to reading, which is what I'm after here for sure.

342
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:40,485
Speaker 2:  And so that to me is like, the fact that it does all of these things, the

343
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:43,645
Speaker 2:  fact that it does them poorly has actually become a feature, not a bug for

344
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:45,925
Speaker 2:  me. Which is not what I expected when I first got this device.

345
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:49,925
Speaker 7:  It's the absolute perfect amount of friction. Yeah, yeah. Whereas the Kindle

346
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:53,885
Speaker 7:  is too much friction for doing most things. The books, devices, it's

347
00:21:53,885 --> 00:21:56,125
Speaker 7:  like just a little bit of friction where it's like, as you say, it's like

348
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,445
Speaker 7:  you wouldn't wanna go surf YouTube and be like, all right, let watch M-K-B-H-D,

349
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:03,525
Speaker 7:  you know, is most recent video on this thing. But if I needed

350
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:06,965
Speaker 7:  to watch a little interview with Dennis Johnson talking about

351
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:10,445
Speaker 7:  train dreams or whatever, like I could pop into that for a second and be

352
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:13,685
Speaker 7:  like, exactly like you said, get what you need to get out of it and go back

353
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:16,885
Speaker 7:  into the reading. And that's, that's exciting. And you know, and I think

354
00:22:16,945 --> 00:22:20,925
Speaker 7:  the perfect amount of friction is exactly what no one is willing to

355
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:24,805
Speaker 7:  bake into most devices. And this is kind of happening almost like as a byproduct,

356
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:28,125
Speaker 7:  a natural, a natural byproduct of the technology. And that feels

357
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:29,965
Speaker 7:  organic and really lovely.

358
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:33,325
Speaker 2:  Totally. Is there anything you would change about the Palmer? Like as a,

359
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:34,005
Speaker 2:  as a gadget?

360
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:37,405
Speaker 7:  I'd probably get rid of the camera. I'd simplify it even more. I

361
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:40,405
Speaker 2:  Forgot it had a camera. Just this moment was the first time I've thought

362
00:22:40,405 --> 00:22:42,365
Speaker 2:  about the Palma's camera since the second I got it.

363
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:45,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I've, I've taken a few photos with it. It's kind of funny to then look

364
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:48,245
Speaker 7:  at them, you know, later and it's like, oh yeah, that's right. I could take

365
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:51,845
Speaker 7:  photos with this. But like, I would probably put the volume

366
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:55,725
Speaker 7:  rockers on both sides. So you could do page change on both sides of it and

367
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:58,445
Speaker 7:  just really optimize for like, if you're holding it with your right hand

368
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:02,365
Speaker 7:  or left hand, you have the exact same kind of hardware interaction model.

369
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:05,885
Speaker 7:  I'd probably move the power button to the top because I think that's the

370
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,885
Speaker 7:  best place for all power buttons. I think the iPhone power button on the

371
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:12,285
Speaker 7:  side was the worst hardware change they made to the iPhone in the history

372
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:15,805
Speaker 7:  of the iPhone. I mean, just because how many times do you accidentally,

373
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:19,805
Speaker 7:  you know, do screenshots and yet, you know, anyway, I love

374
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:23,925
Speaker 7:  power on the top, which by the way, this other books model does power

375
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:27,925
Speaker 7:  on the top in their Okay. In their tablet. And that feels really good. And

376
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:30,405
Speaker 7:  then just, yeah, just have those, have those page from buttons on both sides.

377
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:34,445
Speaker 7:  And then I think that's it. Maybe the screen, like I do feel like the screen

378
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:38,205
Speaker 7:  on this thing is not extremely well protected. You know, I I

379
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:42,285
Speaker 7:  Oh, interesting. Yeah, I would love to see a Gorilla Glass version of

380
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:45,080
Speaker 7:  this. What would that feel like? How much heavier would it make? It, it,

381
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:49,085
Speaker 7:  I wouldn't want the body to be metal. I think this plastic body,

382
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:52,885
Speaker 7:  I think the texture on the back of it is fine. I think lightness is, is

383
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,925
Speaker 7:  is a huge bonus when it comes to devices like this. Agree. And

384
00:23:57,525 --> 00:24:01,125
Speaker 7:  I just worry, like sometimes when I put it in my bag, I'm like, is this screen

385
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:04,965
Speaker 7:  gonna get messed up? I'm still treating it, I'm not babying it at all.

386
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:08,365
Speaker 7:  I'm, I'm just throwing it in my bag and I'm like, okay, whatever's gonna

387
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:12,285
Speaker 7:  happen is gonna happen. But I do feel like a stronger, even

388
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:15,445
Speaker 7:  just like a couple generations old Gorilla Glass might be a really interesting

389
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:18,805
Speaker 7:  modification. I don't know what the IPX rating is, but I'd wanna make sure

390
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:22,685
Speaker 7:  it would be like fully submersible that those would be, you know, I see the

391
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:25,565
Speaker 7:  Palma more as like a long form reading Renaissance device rather than a digital

392
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:29,125
Speaker 7:  book Renaissance device. I buy it. Hopefully it can be that too though. Hopefully

393
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:32,765
Speaker 7:  it can create better interfaces for digital books as well, not just for long

394
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:33,365
Speaker 7:  form articles.

395
00:24:33,715 --> 00:24:36,965
Speaker 2:  Totally. Yeah. And honestly like I, I have spent so many years

396
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:41,005
Speaker 2:  wondering why Amazon has not just built a decent way to read web

397
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:44,845
Speaker 2:  articles on the Kindle. And if if books just makes Amazon do that, it will

398
00:24:44,845 --> 00:24:47,125
Speaker 2:  have done the world a great service. But I don't think it's ever gonna happen.

399
00:24:47,595 --> 00:24:51,045
Speaker 7:  It's never gonna happen. No, no, no. Like you just have to accept that there's

400
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:54,725
Speaker 7:  a certain size of company that internally just doesn't

401
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:58,485
Speaker 7:  doesn't have the willpower Yeah. To do these things that where that, you

402
00:24:58,485 --> 00:25:01,205
Speaker 7:  look at the spreadsheet and you go, what's the market cap of this? What's

403
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:04,245
Speaker 7:  the, you know, duh. And it's essentially a rounding error, you know, it's

404
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:07,525
Speaker 7:  zero and it's just not gonna happen unless

405
00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:12,005
Speaker 7:  you have a C-level person who owns it. And I think with Jeff out

406
00:25:12,005 --> 00:25:15,645
Speaker 7:  of Amazon, I don't know anyone there who is an avid old

407
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:20,205
Speaker 7:  gq, you know, Esquire reader or whatever, right? It's like we've gotta

408
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:24,165
Speaker 7:  make this amazing to read old gay to lease articles or whatever, you

409
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:27,685
Speaker 7:  know, it's like, yep. So thankfully we don't have to, because

410
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:31,405
Speaker 7:  the EIN technology is now trickled down to everyone else

411
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:35,125
Speaker 7:  and companies like books, which we should say, and I think it's important

412
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:38,405
Speaker 7:  to say books is a bad open source citizen, I don't know if you know about

413
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:42,365
Speaker 7:  this, but like they are using I think Android models or

414
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:46,205
Speaker 7:  Android software in a way that breaks the, the terms of the open

415
00:25:46,205 --> 00:25:49,445
Speaker 7:  source license. Oh, Interesting. Like if Hacker News ever, like if a books

416
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:53,005
Speaker 7:  dev like device article comes up on Hacker News, you know, people go nuts

417
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:55,685
Speaker 7:  about this and bring it out. Sure. And I think it is, I think it is important

418
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:59,565
Speaker 7:  to bring up Yeah. Because they are effectively violating the

419
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:02,365
Speaker 7:  license and I, and I think it would be very easy for them to not violate

420
00:26:02,465 --> 00:26:06,405
Speaker 7:  it. And I think we should talk about this in PO in podcasts like this and

421
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:10,245
Speaker 7:  say, Hey books, can you just be a good citizen? It's like such a dumb, easy

422
00:26:10,245 --> 00:26:14,085
Speaker 7:  thing to do, why aren't you doing it? And we'd love to, you know,

423
00:26:14,085 --> 00:26:17,845
Speaker 7:  it would help me even more enthusiastically recommend these

424
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:21,205
Speaker 7:  devices. You know, I, I know anecdotally I have probably sold

425
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:24,765
Speaker 7:  at least a couple hundred of these things in the last couple of months. At

426
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:28,245
Speaker 7:  least I believe it. These are people just messaging me directly. So I may,

427
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:31,725
Speaker 7:  it's probably in the thousands of folks who've bought Palmas and are using

428
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:35,045
Speaker 7:  them and in fact anyone listening to this who has bought a Palmer and has

429
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:38,325
Speaker 7:  had, you know, had an interesting experience with it, I'd love sent please

430
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:41,285
Speaker 7:  right into us. Tell us what changes you would like to see. Yeah, I would

431
00:26:41,285 --> 00:26:44,085
Speaker 7:  love to, I'd love to hear what pe, how people are using these things or thinking

432
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:47,725
Speaker 7:  about it. But it does seem like we are in this moment where maybe, maybe

433
00:26:47,755 --> 00:26:51,685
Speaker 7:  just maybe digital reading of long form stuff could, the interfaces

434
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:55,565
Speaker 7:  for it could change the way we interact with these libraries could

435
00:26:55,565 --> 00:26:56,965
Speaker 7:  change. And it's, it's an exciting moment.

436
00:26:57,845 --> 00:27:01,565
Speaker 2:  I really agree with what Craig said there. I do think this is an exciting

437
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:04,965
Speaker 2:  moment. I think there are a lot of companies out there being like, we will

438
00:27:04,965 --> 00:27:08,805
Speaker 2:  replace your smartphone. And I think that's mostly ridiculous. But I also

439
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:12,365
Speaker 2:  think that there are a lot of things that can be done better than the way

440
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:16,085
Speaker 2:  our phones do them. And it's fun to watch gadgets explore that. Sometimes

441
00:27:16,085 --> 00:27:19,125
Speaker 2:  they get it wrong like the humane AI pin, but there's still something to

442
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:23,045
Speaker 2:  the idea that not everything should be inside of your smartphone. I've been

443
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:26,965
Speaker 2:  using the RayBan Meta Smart Glasses as a way to take photos without sticking

444
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:30,725
Speaker 2:  my phone in my kid's face. I've been using the Apple Watch as a faster way

445
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:34,325
Speaker 2:  to set reminders or take notes and I've been using the Palmer as a way to

446
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:37,925
Speaker 2:  read and listen to stuff without the rest of my digital life getting in the

447
00:27:37,925 --> 00:27:38,045
Speaker 2:  way.

448
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:55,625
Speaker 2:  thanks to a new set of chips from

449
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:46,465
Speaker 2:  the future of Windows than it once did. But we're still getting some of these

450
00:31:46,465 --> 00:31:50,225
Speaker 2:  devices. I still have lots of questions. Companies basically across the

451
00:31:50,445 --> 00:31:54,385
Speaker 2:  PC industry are all in on this copilot plus PC idea. We're starting

452
00:31:54,405 --> 00:31:57,825
Speaker 2:  to see tons of new models, we're gonna have lots of new reviews, but personally

453
00:31:57,825 --> 00:32:01,185
Speaker 2:  the ones I'm most excited about are the ones that come from Microsoft. Microsoft

454
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:04,265
Speaker 2:  has been at, I think, the forefront of Windows hardware for a pretty long

455
00:32:04,265 --> 00:32:07,985
Speaker 2:  time. And with the new Surface Pro and the new Surface laptop is really

456
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:11,465
Speaker 2:  trying to, I would say, show the rest of the industry how this

457
00:32:11,535 --> 00:32:15,145
Speaker 2:  copilot plus PC thing can work. So Tom Warren and

458
00:32:15,145 --> 00:32:18,225
Speaker 2:  Nathan Edwards on our team have been reviewing those devices. They haven't

459
00:32:18,225 --> 00:32:22,185
Speaker 2:  told me anything about how it's going and I am desperate to find out. So

460
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:25,425
Speaker 2:  I'm going to use the fact that we are here on The Vergecast to make them

461
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:29,145
Speaker 2:  tell me things about these new devices. Let's get into it. Tom Warren.

462
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:32,065
Speaker 2:  Hello. Hello. Nathan Edwards. Hello.

463
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:32,905
Speaker 1:  Hi David.

464
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:37,065
Speaker 2:  First let's just level set a little. I wanna know the Microsoft gear

465
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:40,845
Speaker 2:  you both currently have right now. Tom, what do you have in your

466
00:32:40,845 --> 00:32:42,125
Speaker 2:  possession that you've been playing with?

467
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:46,805
Speaker 9:  So I have the 13 inch surface laptop, seventh

468
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,325
Speaker 9:  edition, not seven seventh edition.

469
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:51,325
Speaker 2:  That's very important. Yeah,

470
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:55,965
Speaker 9:  The 15 inch model as well. Okay. The laptop. And I've also

471
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:59,445
Speaker 9:  got the Surface Pro 11th

472
00:32:59,635 --> 00:33:00,125
Speaker 9:  edition.

473
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:01,885
Speaker 10:  It's the 11th edition. Yeah. 11th

474
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:02,565
Speaker 9:  Edition. Yeah.

475
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:06,045
Speaker 2:  For our purposes we're just gonna call them the new ones because God help

476
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:09,365
Speaker 2:  anyone who tries to keep all these numbers in their, in their brains. Yes.

477
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:12,965
Speaker 2:  And that's both of you, so God help both of you. Nathan, you're on the pro,

478
00:33:12,965 --> 00:33:13,885
Speaker 2:  which pro are you on?

479
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:18,445
Speaker 10:  I have the top of the line New pro. It's also

480
00:33:18,685 --> 00:33:22,205
Speaker 10:  13 inches. It's got, they, they of course sent the tricked out version 32

481
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:25,925
Speaker 10:  gigs of ram one terabyte of storage and the

482
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,605
Speaker 10:  elite 8,100 processor.

483
00:33:28,865 --> 00:33:32,725
Speaker 2:  So this is like, if, if there is going to be one that kicks ass, it's gonna

484
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:33,205
Speaker 2:  be this one.

485
00:33:33,505 --> 00:33:36,885
Speaker 10:  Yes. This is their $2,100 without the keyboard

486
00:33:37,335 --> 00:33:37,685
Speaker 10:  model.

487
00:33:38,155 --> 00:33:41,885
Speaker 2:  Okay. That's serious business. So I, I have a lot of

488
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:44,125
Speaker 2:  questions for both of you about both of these vices, but I feel like the

489
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:47,445
Speaker 2:  place we have to start is with the chips, right? Like that is there, there

490
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:50,045
Speaker 2:  are lots of stories of this thing, but I feel like the question most people

491
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:53,245
Speaker 2:  wanna know is like, did did Qualcomm do the thing? Here

492
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:57,685
Speaker 2:  are these things actually good. So Nathan, let's start very top of the line

493
00:33:57,685 --> 00:34:01,165
Speaker 2:  and then Tom, I want to hear your more like mainstreaming experience, but

494
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:03,845
Speaker 2:  what have you, what have you seen so far Nathan? How do these things hold

495
00:34:03,845 --> 00:34:04,005
Speaker 2:  up?

496
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:05,645
Speaker 10:  It does not disappoint me.

497
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:07,125
Speaker 2:  Really? Yes.

498
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:07,885
Speaker 10:  That's

499
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:08,285
Speaker 2:  So exciting.

500
00:34:08,605 --> 00:34:11,685
Speaker 10:  I don't have to think most of the time I don't have to think about the fact

501
00:34:11,685 --> 00:34:15,525
Speaker 10:  that it's not X 86. It's not perfect. And there are like places

502
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:18,925
Speaker 10:  in which it's like not the top runner but it's a good

503
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:23,045
Speaker 10:  laptop, it's a good laptop, a good Windows laptop with an arm

504
00:34:23,155 --> 00:34:23,765
Speaker 10:  processor,

505
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:27,965
Speaker 2:  Which you like really cannot overstate how big a thing that is to be

506
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,845
Speaker 2:  able to say at this moment in time. Yeah.

507
00:34:29,865 --> 00:34:33,725
Speaker 10:  And Tom has the Pro X and I, he's done a little bit of

508
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:37,405
Speaker 10:  like digging it out and brushing the dust off and I want to hear more on

509
00:34:37,405 --> 00:34:40,605
Speaker 10:  that. But like this, I'm not fundamentally fighting the thing

510
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:44,525
Speaker 10:  except in the sense that I would be fundamentally fighting Windows anyway.

511
00:34:44,555 --> 00:34:48,045
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Like generally with a few edge exceptions it it like just works.

512
00:34:48,705 --> 00:34:50,045
Speaker 2:  Tom, has that been your experience too?

513
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:53,045
Speaker 9:  Yeah, pretty much. And I'm, I'm obviously using the

514
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:56,605
Speaker 9:  999 90 9 cent surface

515
00:34:56,865 --> 00:35:00,685
Speaker 9:  laptop and that's the base model. So I've been using that one primarily

516
00:35:00,685 --> 00:35:03,565
Speaker 9:  for the past week. 'cause I mainly, because we obviously didn't get these

517
00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:07,205
Speaker 9:  beforehand for review embargo and all that sort of stuff, so I was

518
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,805
Speaker 9:  like I don't want the tricked out one. I want to test what the base model

519
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:14,725
Speaker 9:  one is because it's got 16 giga Ram 256 giga storage and

520
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:18,685
Speaker 9:  in the x plus processes, which is I think for me

521
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:22,125
Speaker 9:  now testing the, the elite is around about 20% better

522
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:26,125
Speaker 9:  performing but roughly so that that's kind of the gap. But

523
00:35:26,145 --> 00:35:29,045
Speaker 9:  in real terms, if you're just using it day to day, you're probably not gonna

524
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:32,485
Speaker 9:  notice that unless you're really pushing it. But yeah, in terms of app

525
00:35:32,485 --> 00:35:36,165
Speaker 9:  compatibility I'd say like you know like the

526
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:40,005
Speaker 9:  90% of the apps you're gonna use aren't gonna be emulated and the

527
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:43,245
Speaker 9:  the key one being the browser, right? Which obviously everyone kind of lives

528
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:46,645
Speaker 9:  in these days. But then outside of that, yeah there's gonna be some app

529
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:50,565
Speaker 9:  compatibility things, some weird things like Google Drive

530
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:54,325
Speaker 9:  desktop still doesn't work but that isn't necessarily because it can't emulate.

531
00:35:54,635 --> 00:35:58,525
Speaker 9:  It's probably 'cause Google's just flagged it not to. So there's like these

532
00:35:58,525 --> 00:36:02,165
Speaker 9:  weird things of like the past 10, 12 years of Windows

533
00:36:02,305 --> 00:36:06,045
Speaker 9:  and Arm being a bit crappy coming back to sort of haunt it at this time.

534
00:36:06,225 --> 00:36:09,605
Speaker 9:  But Microsoft, Qualcomm have done a quite good job at like getting these

535
00:36:09,885 --> 00:36:13,205
Speaker 9:  software vendors to sort of play ball and it's definitely a lot better than

536
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:14,765
Speaker 9:  I've ever used in the past.

537
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:17,965
Speaker 2:  That is super exciting. Nathan, have you run into anything that just like

538
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:19,085
Speaker 2:  flatly didn't work?

539
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:22,365
Speaker 10:  I mean yeah, so Premier Pro does not work but they told us it wasn't gonna

540
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:26,285
Speaker 10:  work. You're gonna hate this Arc. Arc refuses to run.

541
00:36:26,505 --> 00:36:30,005
Speaker 10:  That's disappointing. It's my browser of choice on both

542
00:36:30,465 --> 00:36:33,645
Speaker 10:  Mac and Windows these days, although it's much better on Max still. And

543
00:36:33,645 --> 00:36:37,605
Speaker 10:  they were just like, sorry we don't support ARM 64. Let us know if you want

544
00:36:37,605 --> 00:36:41,045
Speaker 10:  us to, to put my name in a little form, please let me know. Yeah,

545
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:44,845
Speaker 2:  Please, please let it be known that we want it to, if you're listening,

546
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:48,685
Speaker 2:  yeah we, we would like that. But I would say that alone, those are things

547
00:36:48,685 --> 00:36:52,525
Speaker 2:  that presumably will get updated over time. And Tom, your point about the

548
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:55,685
Speaker 2:  history of this maybe being a problem that there are a lot of folks who were

549
00:36:55,685 --> 00:36:59,285
Speaker 2:  like actually turned it off because the experience was so bad who are now

550
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:03,245
Speaker 2:  gonna have to be convinced to turn emulation stuff back on. My

551
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:05,965
Speaker 2:  hope would be if the performance is as good as you guys are describing that,

552
00:37:05,965 --> 00:37:09,805
Speaker 2:  that'll start to happen fairly quickly. So even the stuff that exists hopefully

553
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:11,165
Speaker 2:  won't exist for too much longer.

554
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:15,285
Speaker 9:  Yeah. And and and with the Adobe stuff like, so we've Premier Pro is quite

555
00:37:15,285 --> 00:37:18,805
Speaker 9:  a funny one because they disabled it or like blocked it on the

556
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:22,965
Speaker 9:  X Elite but they forgot to do it on the X plus. So I got it installed

557
00:37:23,145 --> 00:37:26,125
Speaker 9:  and then I think they realized like a day later and then it like dropped

558
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:29,645
Speaker 9:  outta my creative cloud but I still have it installed and I can understand

559
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:33,565
Speaker 9:  why they blocked it 'cause so I tried to process like a

560
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:37,365
Speaker 9:  4K, a 20, a 22nd 4K video right on on this thing.

561
00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:41,605
Speaker 9:  and it was like stuttering, like I, you couldn't just play it without it

562
00:37:41,765 --> 00:37:45,045
Speaker 9:  skipping and dropping frames and all that sort of stuff. I tried to explore

563
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:48,925
Speaker 9:  it and it was gonna take five minutes to export and that was like for a 22nd

564
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:52,725
Speaker 9:  four game video that's like obviously way too long. And

565
00:37:52,725 --> 00:37:55,605
Speaker 9:  for comparison, this is really unfair comparison but I'm gonna make this

566
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:59,365
Speaker 9:  comparison anyway, I tried out my desktop pc, which is a 4,900

567
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:03,485
Speaker 9:  K and a 49 A and it exported in seven seconds. So

568
00:38:04,085 --> 00:38:07,765
Speaker 9:  I can see why they have Premier Pro blocked on there 'cause it's not a good,

569
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:11,485
Speaker 9:  good experience. I feel like if you were trying to edit in that you would

570
00:38:11,485 --> 00:38:15,205
Speaker 9:  come you like, I feel like you'd make editing mistakes just from the basic

571
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:18,645
Speaker 9:  like trying to crop a video or in the timeline and all that sort of stuff.

572
00:38:18,925 --> 00:38:22,165
Speaker 9:  It's just very lacky because it's obviously, yeah, it's not been optimized

573
00:38:22,185 --> 00:38:25,765
Speaker 9:  and that is a heavyweight app that will hopefully be better later this year

574
00:38:25,765 --> 00:38:29,485
Speaker 9:  once they release the actual ARM 64 version which they, they've promised

575
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:29,725
Speaker 9:  to.

576
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:33,965
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. So it, it seems like the, the performance promises

577
00:38:33,965 --> 00:38:37,925
Speaker 2:  that we've gotten, some of it is like you won't notice the

578
00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:40,405
Speaker 2:  difference And Nathan, it seems like that's kind of in your experience that

579
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:42,725
Speaker 2:  most of the time you don't have to think about the fact that this is an ARM

580
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:46,125
Speaker 2:  processor instead of an X 86 processor, which on its own

581
00:38:46,455 --> 00:38:50,005
Speaker 2:  giant terrific win. Microsoft in particular has also made a lot of noise

582
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:53,805
Speaker 2:  about how it like beats the crap out of Apple silicon and everybody is

583
00:38:53,805 --> 00:38:57,645
Speaker 2:  making large grandiose performance claims here.

584
00:38:57,715 --> 00:39:01,565
Speaker 2:  Like in terms of actual raw performance, like good

585
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:04,525
Speaker 2:  enough is, is a huge deal And that's frankly I would say like that's the

586
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:06,885
Speaker 2:  benchmark and it sounds like we've mostly cleared it and that's very exciting.

587
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:09,765
Speaker 2:  How good are these actually that you've seen so far?

588
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:14,325
Speaker 10:  Well I wanna preface by saying Joan Aelius has our big benchmark

589
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:18,165
Speaker 10:  article coming in a few days. That'll be the big word on it, the official

590
00:39:18,165 --> 00:39:21,445
Speaker 10:  word. But they are single core, they're not as good as

591
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:25,725
Speaker 10:  the M three at all. Okay. They do pretty well on most things

592
00:39:26,085 --> 00:39:29,125
Speaker 10:  compared to the core ultra stuff and compared to

593
00:39:30,155 --> 00:39:33,925
Speaker 10:  Rise N 8,000. But it's like, it's not like it's not crushing anybody.

594
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:37,365
Speaker 10:  They do, they on the reviewer's guide did this very funny

595
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:41,045
Speaker 10:  58% faster than the M three.

596
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:45,405
Speaker 10:  It is on very specifically on cbe, multi-core.

597
00:39:45,795 --> 00:39:49,685
Speaker 10:  Okay. Notably it has about 50% more cores.

598
00:39:50,035 --> 00:39:53,965
Speaker 10:  Each of those core is slower than the M three single core. There's just

599
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:57,525
Speaker 10:  more of them, which is, you know what Sure, yes sure fair. You did it

600
00:39:57,675 --> 00:40:01,445
Speaker 10:  like good job. But it's competitive. They're competitive. Which

601
00:40:01,905 --> 00:40:05,565
Speaker 10:  is more than I could say for any Snapdragon based Windows

602
00:40:05,705 --> 00:40:06,405
Speaker 10:  laptop before.

603
00:40:07,035 --> 00:40:08,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Just to be in range feels like

604
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:09,725
Speaker 10:  In range. Yeah. A

605
00:40:09,725 --> 00:40:09,885
Speaker 2:  Victory.

606
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:11,765
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Battery life is decent.

607
00:40:12,315 --> 00:40:14,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That was the next thing I was gonna ask about because this is hopefully

608
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:18,845
Speaker 2:  the other big byproduct of switching to arm. What, what

609
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:20,365
Speaker 2:  have you seen on the Pro Battery Lifewise?

610
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:24,645
Speaker 10:  So I haven't gotten a full day of battery out of it but

611
00:40:24,645 --> 00:40:28,405
Speaker 10:  I've been doing a lot of benchmarking. Okay. I haven't had like a full day

612
00:40:28,405 --> 00:40:32,045
Speaker 10:  of what I would consider my normal workday. Just like

613
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:36,285
Speaker 10:  doing spreadsheets and word docs and Slack. Slack is

614
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:39,165
Speaker 10:  still a battery killer every time I look at the battery usage thing, Slack

615
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:42,085
Speaker 10:  is right up there. Maybe not as bad as it used to be on Arm

616
00:40:42,255 --> 00:40:45,285
Speaker 2:  Slack is pretty bad on everything to be fair. It is. We should just do an

617
00:40:45,285 --> 00:40:48,045
Speaker 2:  episode at some point where we just sit and yell about all the apps that

618
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:52,005
Speaker 2:  are grossly un inefficient and messy on computers and

619
00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:54,565
Speaker 2:  we would spend a lot of time talking about Slack. I suspect

620
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:57,285
Speaker 10:  It's funny. It does to the computer what it does to our attention span

621
00:40:58,795 --> 00:41:02,165
Speaker 2:  Just slowly destroys it. Yeah. Tom, what are you seeing on the laptop?

622
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:06,285
Speaker 9:  Yeah, really, really good battery life. To be honest. On the first day I

623
00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:09,845
Speaker 9:  was like working outside and it was like I had this screen at a hundred percent

624
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:13,685
Speaker 9:  brightness. I downloading like multiple steam games, doing video calls,

625
00:41:13,915 --> 00:41:16,925
Speaker 9:  working in Photoshop, all that sort of stuff. So I'd say that was probably

626
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:20,685
Speaker 9:  more than my sort of average workday of, of using a laptop.

627
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:25,005
Speaker 9:  But I still got around about seven hours battery life on that day. And then

628
00:41:25,005 --> 00:41:28,165
Speaker 9:  in the evening I charged it up to like a hundred percent. I was using it

629
00:41:28,165 --> 00:41:31,005
Speaker 9:  indoors at like, you know, 50% brightness. You didn't need the a hundred

630
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:34,845
Speaker 9:  percent brightness and I think in around four hours it

631
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:38,765
Speaker 9:  only drained 25%. So Okay. I was like, okay, that's

632
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:42,685
Speaker 9:  good. And then I closed the lid and it had like 70 whatever percent

633
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:46,725
Speaker 9:  remaining at like 11:00 PM and I woke up the next day, did some stuff and

634
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:50,365
Speaker 9:  then I ended up grabbing the laptop about midday and it still had that 70%.

635
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:54,525
Speaker 9:  It was like, I think I went to, went to sleep at like 72 and it had

636
00:41:54,525 --> 00:41:57,725
Speaker 9:  70% and I was like, okay, that's, that's good as well because

637
00:41:57,745 --> 00:41:58,405
Speaker 2:  That's pretty exciting

638
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:01,845
Speaker 9:  Half the time. Yeah. Half the time you close a lid on Windows laptop, you're

639
00:42:01,845 --> 00:42:05,725
Speaker 9:  kind of like, is it gonna wake like just keep this thing plugged in 'cause

640
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:09,085
Speaker 9:  it's not actually gonna, it's gonna just drain the battery overnight.

641
00:42:09,805 --> 00:42:13,685
Speaker 9:  So I've never seen it do that. It's usually like one or 2% it

642
00:42:13,685 --> 00:42:17,165
Speaker 9:  drains overnight. Yeah. And and to be honest, I haven't left it long enough

643
00:42:17,165 --> 00:42:21,045
Speaker 9:  for like, you know, five or six nights to see whether that is one or 2% per

644
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:24,205
Speaker 9:  day or if that's just a, you know, every time you sort of

645
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:28,405
Speaker 9:  sleep at. But yeah, I, the battery life is phenomenal as long

646
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:31,725
Speaker 9:  as you are in the native apps. Yeah. As long as you're doing sort of the

647
00:42:31,725 --> 00:42:35,125
Speaker 9:  lightweight stuff. So if I, if I had a day, I think I had a day where

648
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:39,725
Speaker 9:  I was working predominantly in like Slack and Discord and Chrome

649
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:43,205
Speaker 9:  and, and WhatsApp, you know, not not too heavy lifting apps

650
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:47,765
Speaker 9:  and I think I charged it and I think I got sort of

651
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:51,645
Speaker 9:  sort of like something like six hours and it, and it was about down

652
00:42:51,645 --> 00:42:53,485
Speaker 9:  down 30% in those six hours.

653
00:42:53,745 --> 00:42:54,405
Speaker 2:  Wow, okay.

654
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:58,005
Speaker 9:  Which is pretty Yeah. Which is quite surprising. So Yeah. But, but then

655
00:42:58,185 --> 00:43:01,765
Speaker 9:  if you start downloading stuffing on Steam, like, which is an emulated app.

656
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:05,645
Speaker 9:  Sure. Like I, I could notice it drop by like five

657
00:43:05,645 --> 00:43:08,245
Speaker 9:  to 10% just from downloading a big game on Steam.

658
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:10,085
Speaker 2:  Not even playing, just downloading.

659
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:10,885
Speaker 9:  Just downloading

660
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:14,805
Speaker 2:  Just as soon as it needs to do an emulated app. Yeah. You can feel it working

661
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:15,085
Speaker 2:  harder

662
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:18,365
Speaker 9:  And, and steam's quite vigorous when it's downloading and unpacking games.

663
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:22,125
Speaker 9:  True on the CPU. Yeah. So it's understandable it's done that, but yeah,

664
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:25,765
Speaker 9:  it's emulated. So I'd, I'd be very curious to see if there's ever gonna be

665
00:43:25,845 --> 00:43:29,765
Speaker 9:  a on 64 STEAM client and whether that would improve that. I'm sure there

666
00:43:29,765 --> 00:43:29,885
Speaker 9:  will

667
00:43:29,885 --> 00:43:33,405
Speaker 2:  Be. Yeah. It feels like it's coming but it seems like to me the, the, the

668
00:43:33,465 --> 00:43:37,125
Speaker 2:  two levels of battery tests are like, the first is

669
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:41,445
Speaker 2:  sort of the, the cross country flight test where it's like I can, I can use

670
00:43:41,445 --> 00:43:45,005
Speaker 2:  it in the airport and then like watch two movies on it

671
00:43:45,345 --> 00:43:49,285
Speaker 2:  and then get to wherever I'm going without it dying. That's like, that's

672
00:43:49,285 --> 00:43:52,765
Speaker 2:  test number one. It feels like any laptop that can't pass that test sucks.

673
00:43:53,045 --> 00:43:56,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And then there's the like use it all day and you know,

674
00:43:56,865 --> 00:44:00,205
Speaker 2:  use it and don't charge till the next morning. And this doesn't seem like

675
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:04,005
Speaker 2:  it's quite gotten there, but it does seem like it probably passes the cross

676
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:07,845
Speaker 2:  country flight test, which again for a pretty powerful Windows laptop is

677
00:44:08,005 --> 00:44:11,885
Speaker 2:  a big victory and at least it's like it's not as good as Apple, which

678
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:15,725
Speaker 2:  is pretty easily in the like I can use it all day and then charge it at lunch

679
00:44:15,745 --> 00:44:18,645
Speaker 2:  the next day with a lot of things. This doesn't feel like it's quite there

680
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,685
Speaker 2:  but it's almost there. And that's something

681
00:44:21,045 --> 00:44:21,925
Speaker 9:  I think it probably is.

682
00:44:22,315 --> 00:44:24,765
Speaker 2:  Okay if you're not doing the emulated stuff.

683
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:28,805
Speaker 9:  Yeah. As long as you're not doing emulated stuff. I think so. Like I don't

684
00:44:28,805 --> 00:44:32,205
Speaker 9:  do the battery tests that other sort of reviews do where they just have a

685
00:44:32,205 --> 00:44:35,925
Speaker 9:  bunch of tabs or a bunch of videos going because that stuff is, it's not

686
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:38,405
Speaker 9:  real world. You know, that's the stuff that Microsoft always says, you know,

687
00:44:38,405 --> 00:44:40,205
Speaker 9:  15, 20 hours of video

688
00:44:40,635 --> 00:44:43,685
Speaker 2:  Offline video playback. Like who is that for? Yeah,

689
00:44:43,885 --> 00:44:47,085
Speaker 9:  Yeah. It's like, but I do the real world stuff and I think like I charged

690
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:50,885
Speaker 9:  it on Friday and I used it a bunch over the weekend and then

691
00:44:51,365 --> 00:44:53,845
Speaker 9:  I haven't charged it since Friday and it's 1220 7%.

692
00:44:54,145 --> 00:44:57,565
Speaker 2:  Oh, alright then. Yeah. We're onto something there. Nathan. It sounds like

693
00:44:57,565 --> 00:45:00,285
Speaker 2:  the pro is not quite as good though. It doesn't, it doesn't quite hang as

694
00:45:00,285 --> 00:45:00,405
Speaker 2:  well.

695
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:04,125
Speaker 10:  I would say I haven't had the time, I haven't had the like extended amounts

696
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:07,685
Speaker 10:  of time to test except it was, yeah lemme tell you a CBE Murders

697
00:45:08,515 --> 00:45:12,205
Speaker 10:  Murders the battery life as does actually what killed it was Blender. So

698
00:45:12,205 --> 00:45:16,125
Speaker 10:  if you use Blender, don't get a Snapdragon thing yet. Like if that's part

699
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:20,005
Speaker 10:  of your workflow, it is emulated and it's not hitting the GPU

700
00:45:20,005 --> 00:45:23,965
Speaker 10:  course at all. It's just pure CPU compute, it's brute forcing it,

701
00:45:23,965 --> 00:45:27,765
Speaker 10:  it takes oh boy a long time and it's not pretty. That

702
00:45:27,765 --> 00:45:31,485
Speaker 10:  will like where we're at now, like if there's an app that you need that's

703
00:45:31,485 --> 00:45:35,205
Speaker 10:  not native yet, that's not to say this won't be a good choice, but I

704
00:45:35,205 --> 00:45:37,205
Speaker 10:  wouldn't go for it yet.

705
00:45:37,555 --> 00:45:41,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And also if ever a setup was going to set your computer on fire

706
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:45,885
Speaker 2:  Blender running on the CPU would be would be the answer. Yes. I suspect

707
00:45:46,325 --> 00:45:47,325
Speaker 10:  It got, it got toasty.

708
00:45:47,805 --> 00:45:48,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I would imagine.

709
00:45:49,105 --> 00:45:51,525
Speaker 10:  But not on the keyboard. 'cause that's detachable.

710
00:45:51,745 --> 00:45:54,845
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah. Okay. Wait, I wanna get into all the AI stuff, but we have to talk

711
00:45:54,845 --> 00:45:57,205
Speaker 2:  about that for a minute. I totally forgot about that. This is very exciting.

712
00:45:57,435 --> 00:46:00,125
Speaker 2:  Tell me about this new keyboard setup and how you've been using it.

713
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:04,285
Speaker 10:  So the Surface Pro has a detachable keyboard. It connects by pogo

714
00:46:04,285 --> 00:46:07,365
Speaker 10:  pins. That is the way it's always been. You can pull it off. It's like a

715
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:10,925
Speaker 10:  little folio thing. This year. They finally put a battery in it.

716
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:15,165
Speaker 10:  Not all of them, but there's the, the pro flex keyboard. It's Bluetooth,

717
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:19,085
Speaker 10:  it's got a battery, you want to take it off, you pull it off and it

718
00:46:19,085 --> 00:46:22,885
Speaker 10:  still works. And that feels like, obviously this is the way

719
00:46:23,095 --> 00:46:26,485
Speaker 10:  detachable keyboards ought to be. Yes. Like often they're just like, here

720
00:46:26,485 --> 00:46:30,405
Speaker 10:  is a Bluetooth keyboard or here is a pogo pin keyboard and you sort of

721
00:46:30,405 --> 00:46:34,285
Speaker 10:  have to pick. Pogo pin is great because it doesn't run outta

722
00:46:34,285 --> 00:46:37,525
Speaker 10:  battery. But also if you're in a situation where you want to detach the

723
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:40,965
Speaker 10:  keyboard, then all of a sudden it's dead. But I love this thing.

724
00:46:41,305 --> 00:46:44,605
Speaker 2:  So how have you actually used it in practice? Like what? Give me the, the

725
00:46:44,605 --> 00:46:45,605
Speaker 2:  detached use case.

726
00:46:45,955 --> 00:46:49,845
Speaker 10:  Well for example, for ergonomics, if you want to put the screen on like

727
00:46:49,925 --> 00:46:53,645
Speaker 10:  a big pile of books to get it higher up and keep your keyboard down below,

728
00:46:53,665 --> 00:46:56,165
Speaker 10:  You can do that. That's kind of the use case as

729
00:46:56,165 --> 00:46:59,365
Speaker 2:  Someone I've spent years with like the, I would have the screen in the middle

730
00:46:59,505 --> 00:47:03,405
Speaker 2:  and I would put my laptop up on a stand next to it as kind of a second display.

731
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:07,485
Speaker 2:  Having, being able to use the surface keyboard as the keyboard down

732
00:47:07,485 --> 00:47:09,405
Speaker 2:  on my desk for that. Incredible.

733
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:13,805
Speaker 10:  I will say that it is $350 And. if you, if your

734
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:17,645
Speaker 10:  use case is like you're mostly at home with the thing running this

735
00:47:17,765 --> 00:47:21,285
Speaker 10:  as like your desktop basically, and then you shove it in a bag once in a

736
00:47:21,285 --> 00:47:24,645
Speaker 10:  while and take it with you. You can buy a lot of really nice keyboards.

737
00:47:24,745 --> 00:47:28,685
Speaker 10:  Yes. For $350 and then still have room in the budget for like

738
00:47:28,685 --> 00:47:31,245
Speaker 10:  the regular flex keyboard to take with you. Yeah.

739
00:47:31,245 --> 00:47:34,325
Speaker 2:  You can buy several really nice keyboards for $350.

740
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:36,005
Speaker 10:  You can buy one really nice keyboard.

741
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:37,525
Speaker 2:  You can also buy one. Yeah. Yeah.

742
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:39,725
Speaker 9:  It's like a fur, a third of the price of the surface light

743
00:47:39,945 --> 00:47:41,965
Speaker 2:  As well. I know, it's nuts. Yeah, it's truly nuts.

744
00:47:42,315 --> 00:47:46,285
Speaker 10:  It's $350 or 500 bucks basically with the slim

745
00:47:46,425 --> 00:47:50,045
Speaker 10:  pen. And like many people consider a keyboard to be an important part of

746
00:47:50,045 --> 00:47:50,485
Speaker 10:  a laptop.

747
00:47:51,275 --> 00:47:52,365
Speaker 2:  Many people are saying

748
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:55,885
Speaker 10:  Yeah, but Microsoft their, their big thing is like, listen, we give you

749
00:47:55,885 --> 00:47:59,045
Speaker 10:  options. You can have the regular pogo pin one You can have the Bluetooth

750
00:47:59,105 --> 00:48:02,205
Speaker 10:  one. If you already have a flex keyboard from a previous Surface pro You

751
00:48:02,205 --> 00:48:05,685
Speaker 10:  can just use that. It's backwards compatible. It's fine. Yeah. So like I

752
00:48:05,685 --> 00:48:08,645
Speaker 10:  used to be like, oh why, why? This isn't really a

753
00:48:08,645 --> 00:48:12,565
Speaker 10:  $999 laptop. It's 1200 bucks once you have the keyboard. But like I

754
00:48:12,565 --> 00:48:14,125
Speaker 10:  do actually appreciate the optionality.

755
00:48:14,435 --> 00:48:17,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no I, I totally buy it. Is there any other hardware stuff we should

756
00:48:17,605 --> 00:48:20,045
Speaker 2:  talk about? I feel like for the most part the hardware is as it has been

757
00:48:20,045 --> 00:48:23,205
Speaker 2:  and it's still pretty good. I guess the OLED screen is new. The old screen

758
00:48:23,205 --> 00:48:26,645
Speaker 2:  is nice. Is that exciting? Has that changed your life in any meaningful way?

759
00:48:27,025 --> 00:48:30,365
Speaker 10:  It doesn't change my life. I mean, so it is 120 hertz variable.

760
00:48:31,085 --> 00:48:34,525
Speaker 10:  It goes up to 600 knits and then I think 900 knits of peak brightness for

761
00:48:34,565 --> 00:48:38,445
Speaker 10:  HDR. Right. It's a nice screen. I will say 50% brightness or whatever, not

762
00:48:38,445 --> 00:48:41,245
Speaker 10:  quite enough. I keep having to crank it up a little bit and it does have

763
00:48:41,245 --> 00:48:44,885
Speaker 10:  a little faint grain to it at peak brightness where You can see the, the

764
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:48,845
Speaker 10:  touch sensors in the panel. Several have noticed this. We were

765
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:52,565
Speaker 10:  talking back channelings like Microsoft was like, Hmm, we haven't noticed.

766
00:48:52,745 --> 00:48:54,245
Speaker 10:  And several readers like,

767
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:57,205
Speaker 2:  They're like, don't worry about it. You're not seeing what you think.

768
00:48:57,275 --> 00:49:01,125
Speaker 10:  Fine. It's fine. It doesn't bother me. WeCh noticed it. But no,

769
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:04,565
Speaker 10:  it's a nice thing. I will say you're still in Donga life. Two

770
00:49:04,685 --> 00:49:08,605
Speaker 10:  USBC ports. They do still have the surface connector on the other side,

771
00:49:08,605 --> 00:49:12,285
Speaker 10:  which is like a magnetic proprietary connector. Which again, Microsoft is

772
00:49:12,285 --> 00:49:14,405
Speaker 10:  like, listen, you wanna charge with that? That's fine. You can charge via

773
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:18,205
Speaker 10:  USBC. That's fine. I have it connected to my, usually I have it connected

774
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:22,085
Speaker 10:  to my like 32 inch 4K monitor with A-U-S-B-C

775
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:25,965
Speaker 10:  and it powers the laptop at full speed. It runs all that stuff. But

776
00:49:26,215 --> 00:49:30,085
Speaker 10:  right now when you're not hooked in two USB ports, seaports

777
00:49:30,085 --> 00:49:33,485
Speaker 10:  is still pretty limiting. Yeah, especially 'cause there's no headphone Jack.

778
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:37,965
Speaker 2:  I, yeah, it's not enough. I agree. I've gotten used to it as a MacBook Air

779
00:49:37,965 --> 00:49:41,485
Speaker 2:  user for years. But then yeah, every, every time

780
00:49:42,085 --> 00:49:46,005
Speaker 2:  I am forced to encounter a computer with more, it's like, oh, this is delightful.

781
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:49,805
Speaker 2:  Like I have a, I have a surface laptop studio from a couple of years ago

782
00:49:49,805 --> 00:49:52,525
Speaker 2:  and that thing just feels like it has infinite ports compared to this one.

783
00:49:52,955 --> 00:49:56,765
Speaker 10:  It's just nice. Like right now we're, so we're recording and I have my

784
00:49:56,765 --> 00:50:00,645
Speaker 10:  headphones plugged into U-A-U-S-B-C dongle and that takes up one

785
00:50:00,645 --> 00:50:04,285
Speaker 10:  port and I have our microphone plugged into USBC and that takes up the other

786
00:50:04,285 --> 00:50:08,125
Speaker 10:  port and that's all the ports I'm charging from the surface

787
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:11,885
Speaker 10:  connector. So I'm glad that that's there. That's it. Yes, I have dongles

788
00:50:11,905 --> 00:50:15,485
Speaker 10:  and gizmos and gadgets golo, but like it'd be nice.

789
00:50:15,995 --> 00:50:17,405
Speaker 9:  What do you think of the track pad?

790
00:50:18,075 --> 00:50:21,605
Speaker 10:  It's fine. It's a track pad. I don't hate it. I don't love it.

791
00:50:21,905 --> 00:50:25,445
Speaker 9:  So I started using it today after using the bigger surface

792
00:50:25,545 --> 00:50:29,485
Speaker 9:  laptop track pad for the last week. And I keep hitting the bottom of the

793
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,285
Speaker 9:  key, like the, 'cause it's, they've made it vertically smaller.

794
00:50:32,545 --> 00:50:35,045
Speaker 10:  Yes, it is a little compressed. It's small. You're right.

795
00:50:35,245 --> 00:50:38,845
Speaker 9:  I don't like that because, because the, the slim pen is always on display

796
00:50:38,845 --> 00:50:39,885
Speaker 9:  now as well up top.

797
00:50:40,105 --> 00:50:40,725
Speaker 2:  Oh, interesting.

798
00:50:40,795 --> 00:50:43,645
Speaker 9:  Yeah. So you've lost a little bit of, they've, they've just sort of shifted

799
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,765
Speaker 9:  the keyboard down accordingly. So,

800
00:50:45,905 --> 00:50:46,805
Speaker 2:  But yeah, I don't love that.

801
00:50:47,065 --> 00:50:50,365
Speaker 10:  The little cradle for the s slim pen does charge the pen, which I do like,

802
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:53,885
Speaker 10:  that's nice because I have an air with the new pencil pro,

803
00:50:54,315 --> 00:50:58,005
Speaker 10:  that thing just goes flying all over the place. Like it magnets to the top

804
00:50:58,005 --> 00:51:01,525
Speaker 10:  to charge. Yes. But it just, it's just every time I pick it up, the pen

805
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:04,165
Speaker 10:  flies off into the distance. I'm amazed I haven't lost it yet.

806
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:07,285
Speaker 2:  You might have a magnet problem but that's, that's for another day. So wait,

807
00:51:07,285 --> 00:51:10,045
Speaker 2:  let, let's just talk about the AI stuff here for a few minutes before we

808
00:51:10,045 --> 00:51:13,925
Speaker 2:  switch gears. The promise of all of this stuff is that it

809
00:51:13,925 --> 00:51:17,045
Speaker 2:  will do on device AI things that will make everything wonderful.

810
00:51:17,545 --> 00:51:21,525
Speaker 2:  Recall obviously its own story, not here. We'll worry about that

811
00:51:21,525 --> 00:51:25,405
Speaker 2:  another time. What stuff have you guys noticed in the course of testing

812
00:51:25,405 --> 00:51:29,245
Speaker 2:  these things that feels like it is part of the sort of AI PC future?

813
00:51:29,605 --> 00:51:33,445
Speaker 2:  I just wanna say as soon as I said that Nathan's webcam started moving

814
00:51:33,445 --> 00:51:35,925
Speaker 2:  around, which I suspect is an answer to my question,

815
00:51:36,445 --> 00:51:39,285
Speaker 10:  A lot of gimmicks and a couple slightly useful features.

816
00:51:39,515 --> 00:51:41,125
Speaker 2:  Okay. Hit me with the useful ones first.

817
00:51:41,585 --> 00:51:45,565
Speaker 10:  So the Windows studio effects on the webcam, some of them

818
00:51:45,565 --> 00:51:49,045
Speaker 10:  are kind of nice like, so they, they use this absurd like ultra wide

819
00:51:49,145 --> 00:51:53,005
Speaker 10:  webcam on the surface pro that like makes you look like you're being looked

820
00:51:53,005 --> 00:51:56,725
Speaker 10:  at by a 4-year-old. You're looming over them and so they, they use

821
00:51:56,785 --> 00:52:00,765
Speaker 10:  the studio effects to crop that down to like center you and it follows you

822
00:52:00,765 --> 00:52:03,445
Speaker 10:  around the frame. Like you've got your dedicated camera person like the

823
00:52:03,445 --> 00:52:07,365
Speaker 10:  Nest hub Max does, it's also got fake eye contact thing like Nvidia

824
00:52:07,435 --> 00:52:07,725
Speaker 10:  uses.

825
00:52:08,145 --> 00:52:09,645
Speaker 2:  Oh no, that stuff creeps me out.

826
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:11,925
Speaker 10:  I mean yeah, it's creepy.

827
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:15,045
Speaker 2:  It feels like a good idea. It's one of those things that like once that's

828
00:52:15,585 --> 00:52:19,405
Speaker 2:  not creepy it'll be great. But at least everything I've seen

829
00:52:19,405 --> 00:52:21,605
Speaker 2:  so far it, it veers toward creepy.

830
00:52:22,225 --> 00:52:23,405
Speaker 10:  Is it creeping you out right now?

831
00:52:24,025 --> 00:52:27,365
Speaker 2:  Now you pointed it wasn't until you pointed it out and now I feel like I'm

832
00:52:27,365 --> 00:52:29,205
Speaker 2:  looking too deep into your eyes through a webcam.

833
00:52:29,465 --> 00:52:33,365
Speaker 10:  So there's that. It does have live captioning, which is on device and it

834
00:52:33,365 --> 00:52:37,285
Speaker 10:  can caption any video that's playing on your computer. Oh that's

835
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:40,765
Speaker 10:  cool. I tried it a couple times. I tried it in a video call

836
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:45,005
Speaker 10:  with Antonio and with Joanna and it translated

837
00:52:45,155 --> 00:52:48,965
Speaker 10:  Italian like spoken on the fly pretty well. But it was

838
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:52,125
Speaker 10:  like, you know, where's the library level Italian? Sure. I tried playing

839
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:56,045
Speaker 10:  it on Netflix. I was watching Delicious in Dungeon. You'll be shocked that

840
00:52:56,045 --> 00:52:59,085
Speaker 10:  it could not keep up nor did it match the quality of the

841
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:02,565
Speaker 10:  actual human translated subtitles.

842
00:53:02,905 --> 00:53:05,085
Speaker 2:  But it's serviceable in a pinch I guess

843
00:53:05,385 --> 00:53:08,685
Speaker 10:  It seems to be okay. Little slow. But like it's cool that it can do that

844
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,565
Speaker 10:  on device. That's a cool use of the NPU. I've not been that impressed

845
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:16,325
Speaker 10:  with any of the image creation or co-creation stuff, although

846
00:53:16,345 --> 00:53:18,005
Speaker 10:  I'm curious if Tom has a different experience.

847
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:21,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Tom have you, have you seen any features that have jumped out to you?

848
00:53:21,445 --> 00:53:25,405
Speaker 9:  I mean there's not a lot, let's be honest that that stuff feels like a

849
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:28,285
Speaker 9:  bit of a side show to the, the windows and arm stuff really. I don't know

850
00:53:28,425 --> 00:53:32,245
Speaker 9:  why they need to make such a big deal out of it because it, it's,

851
00:53:32,245 --> 00:53:34,765
Speaker 9:  it's like they're laying the foundations for this stuff but it's not quite

852
00:53:34,765 --> 00:53:38,245
Speaker 9:  there yet. So, so you've got like paint in paint, they've got image

853
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:41,485
Speaker 9:  co-creator, which is, which is interesting on the on the surface laptop because

854
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:45,005
Speaker 9:  one thing I should say is that it doesn't support pen and per anymore. Like

855
00:53:45,005 --> 00:53:47,965
Speaker 9:  whereas you could use this slim pen before on the previous module, you can't.

856
00:53:47,965 --> 00:53:51,685
Speaker 9:  Now the image co-create of feature here pretty much relies on you

857
00:53:51,685 --> 00:53:55,605
Speaker 9:  drawing what you want to see, which obviously You can do on a trap pad, but

858
00:53:55,605 --> 00:53:58,245
Speaker 9:  it's kind of a little bit not the best way to, to draw. You just wanna do

859
00:53:58,245 --> 00:54:01,485
Speaker 9:  it on the screen what you'd have to touch. So yeah,

860
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:05,485
Speaker 9:  that feature seems a little bit less useful than on the Pro

861
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:08,925
Speaker 9:  if I'm honest, because it's just way more easy just to draw. But even still,

862
00:54:09,025 --> 00:54:12,445
Speaker 9:  it just uses like a, a local AI model, which I think

863
00:54:12,755 --> 00:54:15,805
Speaker 9:  it's using. Is this stable diffusion? It's using I think,

864
00:54:15,805 --> 00:54:17,125
Speaker 10:  Yeah, they told us it was stable diffusion

865
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,805
Speaker 9:  And the results are pretty bad. They terrible, honest.

866
00:54:21,355 --> 00:54:22,085
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I

867
00:54:22,085 --> 00:54:25,285
Speaker 2:  Mean what would you expect from paint? I like, I, I don't know how high my

868
00:54:25,755 --> 00:54:27,885
Speaker 2:  high, my bar for quality would really be there.

869
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:32,045
Speaker 9:  Yeah. I tried to draw, draw like a dog on a beach with a ball

870
00:54:32,465 --> 00:54:35,725
Speaker 9:  and it drew the dog fine, but it just refused to pick up the fact that I'd

871
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:39,565
Speaker 9:  drawn a ball and in the prompt I'd said I wanted a ball. It was just like

872
00:54:39,565 --> 00:54:43,485
Speaker 9:  this lonely dog looking all sad on the beach and it just, yeah, it just

873
00:54:43,485 --> 00:54:47,325
Speaker 9:  looked junk. Anyway. But even though it's using a local AI

874
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:50,405
Speaker 9:  model, you still need to be connected to the internet. And I know this because

875
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:54,125
Speaker 9:  when I first did Hands on May 20th, you could turn off the

876
00:54:54,355 --> 00:54:58,125
Speaker 9:  wifi and do the image creation in in a

877
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:01,845
Speaker 9:  photos app it and it had no filters. So you could put Bill

878
00:55:01,895 --> 00:55:05,885
Speaker 9:  Gates, you know, whatever, you could do the typical Mario stuff and it would

879
00:55:06,005 --> 00:55:08,965
Speaker 9:  generate it and it was really bad 'cause it's stable diffusion, it wasn't

880
00:55:08,965 --> 00:55:11,805
Speaker 9:  very good but you could do it. But they've changed that now. So you have

881
00:55:11,805 --> 00:55:15,765
Speaker 9:  to sign in, you have to be online even though it's using a AI local

882
00:55:15,855 --> 00:55:16,965
Speaker 9:  model to do that.

883
00:55:17,265 --> 00:55:21,245
Speaker 10:  The same is true for co-creator. Yeah. Like it generates it on device with

884
00:55:21,245 --> 00:55:24,445
Speaker 10:  the limited model that it has and then it runs it by the safety filters

885
00:55:24,445 --> 00:55:25,005
Speaker 10:  just in case.

886
00:55:25,225 --> 00:55:26,245
Speaker 9:  That's right. Yeah. Yeah.

887
00:55:26,245 --> 00:55:30,125
Speaker 10:  But it, it could just, why not just send it off to a more powerful model

888
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:30,565
Speaker 10:  somewhere else?

889
00:55:30,635 --> 00:55:34,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's an odd way of doing that. You're actually doing all the

890
00:55:34,525 --> 00:55:38,365
Speaker 2:  hard stuff in the place where you wouldn't wanna do the hard stuff. It's

891
00:55:38,365 --> 00:55:42,325
Speaker 2:  a very weird system in general though. It feels like the read on these so

892
00:55:42,325 --> 00:55:46,085
Speaker 2:  far, at least to me seems like the basics are good,

893
00:55:46,085 --> 00:55:48,285
Speaker 2:  right? That like Tom, what you're saying is that the Windows Unarm thing

894
00:55:48,285 --> 00:55:51,325
Speaker 2:  is a much bigger deal that it's like, okay we've now done the thing that

895
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:55,325
Speaker 2:  yeah, windows now works pretty well on Arm, we'll we'll solve some of these

896
00:55:55,715 --> 00:55:59,445
Speaker 2:  last remaining apps and use cases. But the question of like,

897
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:03,565
Speaker 2:  so what do we do with that? Doesn't really seem like it's been answered yet

898
00:56:03,675 --> 00:56:07,325
Speaker 2:  that like the, and and I guess maybe that's supposed to be recall, right?

899
00:56:07,325 --> 00:56:11,165
Speaker 2:  That like this is what we get with all this new stuff, but the the

900
00:56:11,165 --> 00:56:14,485
Speaker 2:  like what is now possible and cool and new and exciting

901
00:56:14,755 --> 00:56:18,325
Speaker 2:  because we've made Windows on arm work and because these Qualcomm chips are

902
00:56:18,325 --> 00:56:22,165
Speaker 2:  good, it doesn't really feel like either of you have found a super exciting

903
00:56:22,165 --> 00:56:24,765
Speaker 2:  compelling answer to that yet. Is that fair?

904
00:56:25,145 --> 00:56:28,645
Speaker 9:  No, I I think it's because they're pretty much laying the groundwork for

905
00:56:28,645 --> 00:56:31,245
Speaker 9:  this stuff. Yeah. So it's kind of like build it and they'll come. That's

906
00:56:31,245 --> 00:56:34,925
Speaker 9:  the, that's their approach, right? And obviously recall is

907
00:56:35,205 --> 00:56:37,965
Speaker 9:  supposed to be the flagship feature here, but obviously we can't, we can't

908
00:56:37,965 --> 00:56:41,885
Speaker 9:  try it yet. So I mean I have been using it for like two weeks on the surface

909
00:56:42,025 --> 00:56:45,125
Speaker 9:  Pro X when it was, you know, you could hack it to, to get it working

910
00:56:46,025 --> 00:56:49,845
Speaker 9:  so I got some falls on it. But yeah, like I feel like even

911
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:53,645
Speaker 9:  with that, it's not like a massive selling point like that

912
00:56:53,645 --> 00:56:56,165
Speaker 9:  that's, that's not really, I don't think the reason you're gonna buy this,

913
00:56:56,195 --> 00:56:59,965
Speaker 9:  this laptop, it's mainly 'cause you want a good performing laptop

914
00:56:59,965 --> 00:57:03,725
Speaker 9:  that's and light and it actually has good battery life, you know? And that's

915
00:57:04,185 --> 00:57:07,925
Speaker 9:  as a base model at 999 bucks is like pretty

916
00:57:07,935 --> 00:57:11,605
Speaker 9:  compelling. Yeah. Like it's a hundred dollars less than a Mapa M three model.

917
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:14,885
Speaker 9:  That in itself is compelling enough I think to get people to buy it. So I

918
00:57:14,885 --> 00:57:18,245
Speaker 9:  don't, I don't know why Microsoft had to kind of like put these AI tricks

919
00:57:18,245 --> 00:57:22,205
Speaker 9:  in there that aren't, they're not really that impressive maybe recall.

920
00:57:22,555 --> 00:57:25,485
Speaker 9:  Yeah, sure. That might be impressive for controversial

921
00:57:25,705 --> 00:57:29,525
Speaker 2:  Nathan, is that where you've landed to kind of very good device, nice job,

922
00:57:29,625 --> 00:57:33,485
Speaker 2:  but there is, this is not like a brand new day for the PC era

923
00:57:33,905 --> 00:57:34,125
Speaker 2:  yet.

924
00:57:34,475 --> 00:57:38,405
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I mean I think that all of the AI stuff is, they have

925
00:57:38,405 --> 00:57:41,405
Speaker 10:  this processor and they're trying to figure out reasons to use it. It's

926
00:57:41,405 --> 00:57:45,085
Speaker 10:  free real estate. They're looking for something to do with AI because

927
00:57:45,225 --> 00:57:48,725
Speaker 10:  AI is buzzy, it's on the chips anyway. They've got the NPUs, what are you,

928
00:57:48,745 --> 00:57:51,605
Speaker 10:  you gotta find something to do. But the reason to buy this thing, yeah,

929
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:54,725
Speaker 10:  like Tom said, it's got good battery life. It's a, it's nice.

930
00:57:56,635 --> 00:57:59,925
Speaker 10:  Yeah, like it's, it's it's, it's a third option. It's a good option.

931
00:58:00,545 --> 00:58:04,525
Speaker 10:  Not for gaming but for like normal productivity stuff, like it seems like

932
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:08,325
Speaker 10:  a good value. Yeah. And yeah, I just kind of ignore the AI

933
00:58:08,325 --> 00:58:10,725
Speaker 10:  stuff for now. If somebody will find something useful to do with it, maybe,

934
00:58:11,245 --> 00:58:15,125
Speaker 10:  probably like they've got the compute there even just as it is. If

935
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:18,685
Speaker 10:  that, if that module wasn't there at all, I don't think I'd notice and it

936
00:58:18,685 --> 00:58:20,045
Speaker 10:  wouldn't change my opinion that much.

937
00:58:20,635 --> 00:58:24,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's fair. I'm sitting here looking at my new iPad Pro

938
00:58:24,905 --> 00:58:27,725
Speaker 2:  and I feel precisely exactly the same way about it.

939
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:31,925
Speaker 10:  I tried to work on an iPad a couple weeks ago on vacation and I hated

940
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:36,005
Speaker 10:  every second of it and I was like, why can't they just, you know

941
00:58:36,005 --> 00:58:39,565
Speaker 10:  the refrain. Oh yeah, just put Mac OS on it, whatever. Just put a real

942
00:58:39,565 --> 00:58:43,445
Speaker 10:  operating system on it. I will say I got the Surface Pro and I opened it

943
00:58:43,445 --> 00:58:47,325
Speaker 10:  up and I was like a real operating system. I can have two Windows side

944
00:58:47,325 --> 00:58:51,205
Speaker 10:  by side. I can run something in the background, I can do stuff, I can

945
00:58:51,525 --> 00:58:55,445
Speaker 10:  download utilities. I have a clipboard manager, you know what? And I

946
00:58:55,445 --> 00:58:57,085
Speaker 10:  can still watch Netflix if I really want to.

947
00:58:57,635 --> 00:59:00,885
Speaker 2:  It's not a bad setup. Alex Kranz has been running around for two months saying

948
00:59:00,885 --> 00:59:04,525
Speaker 2:  everybody who thinks they want an iPad Pro actually wants a surface. And

949
00:59:04,525 --> 00:59:07,165
Speaker 2:  I think she's not crazy about that. No,

950
00:59:07,575 --> 00:59:11,125
Speaker 10:  She's not wrong. I mean you very much still are using Windows

951
00:59:11,185 --> 00:59:15,045
Speaker 10:  11 and therefore you're on, you're like, especially on a surface,

952
00:59:15,065 --> 00:59:17,885
Speaker 10:  you're like fully locked into Microsoft's

953
00:59:47,365 --> 00:59:50,805
Speaker 2:  Alright, this is actually a good segue into a question we got on the hotline.

954
00:59:50,805 --> 00:59:52,885
Speaker 2:  We need to take a break really fast. Can you guys stick around and help me

955
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:53,925
Speaker 2:  answer this question? Yes,

956
00:59:54,155 --> 00:59:54,445
Speaker 10:  Sure.

957
00:59:54,865 --> 00:59:56,085
Speaker 2:  All right, cool. We'll be right back.

958
01:02:22,845 --> 01:02:26,345
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's do a question from The Vergecast hotline as

959
01:02:26,345 --> 01:02:30,065
Speaker 2:  always, the number is 8 6 6 VERGE one one. Send all of your questions. You

960
01:02:30,065 --> 01:02:33,105
Speaker 2:  can also email vergecast at The Verge dot com. Send us all of your questions.

961
01:02:33,105 --> 01:02:35,545
Speaker 2:  The weirder the better. We've gotten some weird ones and I enjoy it very

962
01:02:35,545 --> 01:02:39,225
Speaker 2:  much. This week we have a question about precisely what we've been talking

963
01:02:39,225 --> 01:02:40,825
Speaker 2:  about and it comes from Dean.

964
01:02:42,205 --> 01:02:46,105
Speaker 16:  Hey, my name is Dean, I'm from Northern Virginia. The

965
01:02:46,785 --> 01:02:50,625
Speaker 16:  question that I have is regarding Windows 11 computers

966
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:54,305
Speaker 16:  and what's gonna happen in the market now that the new Windows on

967
01:02:54,485 --> 01:02:58,345
Speaker 16:  arm units are being released. Will the market be

968
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:02,585
Speaker 16:  some new style Windows 11 and some of the

969
01:03:02,605 --> 01:03:06,065
Speaker 16:  old ones still on the market or do you think soon

970
01:03:06,445 --> 01:03:10,385
Speaker 16:  the X 86 architects will be completely gone and people will only

971
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:13,865
Speaker 16:  be able to purchase the So-called AI PCs

972
01:03:14,285 --> 01:03:16,705
Speaker 16:  and I was wondering if there'll be a massive, you think there'll be a massive

973
01:03:16,895 --> 01:03:20,665
Speaker 16:  fire sale as the X 86 inventory gets

974
01:03:20,665 --> 01:03:24,385
Speaker 16:  cleared out. Do you think there'll be a high end, low end situation where

975
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:28,305
Speaker 16:  the new architecture will be at the high end and the X 86 will be at the

976
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:31,865
Speaker 16:  low end? Just wondering how you see the PC market shaking out once

977
01:03:32,405 --> 01:03:36,305
Speaker 16:  the AI PCs, windows on arm PCs come on

978
01:03:36,305 --> 01:03:37,425
Speaker 16:  the market. Thank you.

979
01:03:38,085 --> 01:03:41,225
Speaker 2:  All right Nathan, you were making several faces during that. Tell me what

980
01:03:41,225 --> 01:03:41,465
Speaker 2:  you think.

981
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:45,585
Speaker 10:  I do not think that Snapdragon, I don't think that ARM is going to wholesale

982
01:03:45,585 --> 01:03:49,505
Speaker 10:  replace X 86 for Windows computers. Certainly not on the low

983
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:53,145
Speaker 10:  end because at least for now Microsoft has mandated 16

984
01:03:53,255 --> 01:03:57,225
Speaker 10:  gigs of RAM and I think it's 2 56 gigs of storage. And the cheapest

985
01:03:57,535 --> 01:04:01,465
Speaker 10:  copilot plus PC we've seen so far is about a grand. I don't

986
01:04:01,465 --> 01:04:05,425
Speaker 10:  think we've seen anything under the 9 99 mark at the moment. They don't

987
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:09,345
Speaker 10:  really have anything that can compete with like a $400 Windows laptop on

988
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:13,305
Speaker 10:  price, nor do they have anything for gaming. They don't work right now

989
01:04:13,305 --> 01:04:17,105
Speaker 10:  with dedicated GPUs. The internal GPUs are not

990
01:04:17,445 --> 01:04:21,105
Speaker 10:  for gaming at all. No, I mean You can do some casual stuff but

991
01:04:21,255 --> 01:04:23,825
Speaker 10:  they're not gonna high wholesale replace. I don't think it's gonna be a

992
01:04:23,825 --> 01:04:27,745
Speaker 10:  high low either because I think there's still gonna be your high end X 86

993
01:04:27,745 --> 01:04:31,185
Speaker 10:  stuff, not just for gaming but for anything that requires serious graphical

994
01:04:31,185 --> 01:04:35,065
Speaker 10:  processing. Also compatibility issues. Like

995
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:39,025
Speaker 10:  I think this is gonna end up at best. It'll be a third option at the

996
01:04:39,025 --> 01:04:41,785
Speaker 10:  soda fountain and I think a good option for a lot of people, especially

997
01:04:41,785 --> 01:04:45,305
Speaker 10:  for the productivity thin and light space. But yeah, we have a lot of unknowns

998
01:04:45,305 --> 01:04:49,065
Speaker 10:  about how Intel's next processor architecture is gonna go

999
01:04:49,075 --> 01:04:52,345
Speaker 10:  lunar lake or Lake and Tom I think can speak much better to that.

1000
01:04:52,495 --> 01:04:55,825
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Tom, I'm curious your read on this, because you've been reporting a

1001
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:59,545
Speaker 2:  lot on how bullish Microsoft is on all of this and

1002
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:03,425
Speaker 2:  how much kind of muscle and marketing weight it's putting behind this. And

1003
01:05:03,665 --> 01:05:07,265
Speaker 2:  I feel like if I were to squint at it a little, I could imagine a world in

1004
01:05:07,265 --> 01:05:10,745
Speaker 2:  which Microsoft is really excited about, you know, arm being the future of

1005
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:14,585
Speaker 2:  everything on Windows. What is your sense of where we're headed there? Yeah,

1006
01:05:14,705 --> 01:05:18,300
Speaker 9:  I think it's, look, they obviously tried to start doing this since 2012 and

1007
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:22,125
Speaker 9:  it's been a long time coming and I think this is the beginning of a transition.

1008
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:26,085
Speaker 9:  I, I don't know if it will fully, you know, displace Intel and a MD,

1009
01:05:26,305 --> 01:05:29,965
Speaker 9:  but I do wonder if, if a MD really has much of a market in the

1010
01:05:29,965 --> 01:05:33,645
Speaker 9:  laptop side of things going forward 'cause they're always a second choice

1011
01:05:33,645 --> 01:05:37,405
Speaker 9:  anyway and now this kind of, does this make them a third choice? I don't

1012
01:05:37,405 --> 01:05:40,325
Speaker 9:  know. Like it's, it's, it's gonna be interesting to see, to see how that

1013
01:05:40,325 --> 01:05:44,125
Speaker 9:  shakes out. But then Qualcomm are about, about to rev their chips next year

1014
01:05:44,145 --> 01:05:47,245
Speaker 9:  as well, so, which will probably be coming around about the same time as

1015
01:05:47,245 --> 01:05:50,725
Speaker 9:  we see M four MacBooks. So that's gonna be interesting. So I think this is,

1016
01:05:50,725 --> 01:05:54,445
Speaker 9:  this is a train that's not gonna slow down now. It's kicked off the way it

1017
01:05:54,445 --> 01:05:58,285
Speaker 9:  should have done originally or at least a few years ago anyway. And

1018
01:05:58,445 --> 01:06:00,805
Speaker 9:  I think it's, it's definitely not gonna slow down. I would, I wouldn't be

1019
01:06:00,805 --> 01:06:04,525
Speaker 9:  surprised if we see a lot more sort of

1020
01:06:04,825 --> 01:06:08,565
Speaker 9:  PCs and and cheaper ones in like sort of like the 20 20, 25, 20 26

1021
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:09,965
Speaker 9:  era. So, so

1022
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:13,645
Speaker 2:  It, it seems like best case scenario is not

1023
01:06:13,675 --> 01:06:17,645
Speaker 2:  that arm wins, but that this just makes everything more

1024
01:06:17,925 --> 01:06:21,525
Speaker 2:  exciting and more competitive, right? That Intel has to

1025
01:06:21,705 --> 01:06:25,325
Speaker 2:  get its act together because there's real competition and so it starts doing

1026
01:06:25,325 --> 01:06:28,005
Speaker 2:  better and a MD starts doing better and all of a sudden we have a bunch of

1027
01:06:28,745 --> 01:06:32,405
Speaker 2:  really good options instead of a bunch of, I would say increasingly

1028
01:06:32,665 --> 01:06:36,325
Speaker 2:  non-competitive options, which is where we've been for a while now thanks

1029
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:40,085
Speaker 2:  to Intel. I also wonder about that because then it's like, okay,

1030
01:06:40,105 --> 01:06:43,805
Speaker 2:  how do you make a Windows that works with everything all of these ways?

1031
01:06:43,945 --> 01:06:47,685
Speaker 2:  So I guess Nathan is the best outcome here that we get one

1032
01:06:47,705 --> 01:06:51,525
Speaker 2:  winner or the other in some meaningful way because it'll like make the software

1033
01:06:51,525 --> 01:06:54,485
Speaker 2:  better and make everything make more sense. Or should we, you know, let a

1034
01:06:54,645 --> 01:06:56,605
Speaker 2:  thousand chip flowers bloom and everything will be fine.

1035
01:06:57,005 --> 01:07:00,925
Speaker 10:  I mean that's windows isn't it? Let a chip a thousand flowers bloom,

1036
01:07:00,925 --> 01:07:03,885
Speaker 10:  like the whole thing backwards compatibility forward. Its compatibility

1037
01:07:04,685 --> 01:07:06,405
Speaker 10:  sideways, compatibility like, but

1038
01:07:06,405 --> 01:07:09,005
Speaker 2:  That's been part of the challenge, right? Like I think that if you want to

1039
01:07:09,245 --> 01:07:12,565
Speaker 2:  describe whatever mess exists inside of Windows, I think You can ascribe

1040
01:07:12,685 --> 01:07:14,885
Speaker 2:  a lot of it to that exact thing. Yeah,

1041
01:07:15,225 --> 01:07:18,965
Speaker 10:  You can, I mean I don't think if there's gonna be a winner, an

1042
01:07:18,965 --> 01:07:22,845
Speaker 10:  overall winner, I don't know, I just don't see it. There's so much on

1043
01:07:22,885 --> 01:07:26,845
Speaker 10:  X 86, I don't think it would be arm, like they don't have the

1044
01:07:26,845 --> 01:07:30,445
Speaker 10:  pull, they're, they're beholden to huge enterprise deployments

1045
01:07:30,665 --> 01:07:34,405
Speaker 10:  in a way that Mac frankly is not. They can be like, Hey, heads up

1046
01:07:34,455 --> 01:07:37,845
Speaker 10:  we're switching silicon entirely, right? And

1047
01:07:38,265 --> 01:07:41,325
Speaker 10:  you're gonna have to deal with it and I don't think

1048
01:07:42,285 --> 01:07:46,245
Speaker 10:  Microsoft can or wants to do that, but yeah, may maybe this makes things

1049
01:07:46,245 --> 01:07:49,485
Speaker 10:  more complicated for developers. They're like, okay great, now I gotta make

1050
01:07:49,485 --> 01:07:51,405
Speaker 10:  an arm 64 version two.

1051
01:07:51,945 --> 01:07:55,885
Speaker 2:  So it does seem like the, the idea that these copilot

1052
01:07:55,885 --> 01:07:59,405
Speaker 2:  plus PCs are going to like immediately sweep the market and be so much better

1053
01:07:59,795 --> 01:08:03,645
Speaker 2:  that they're going to like take over, at least from y'all's experience

1054
01:08:03,645 --> 01:08:07,565
Speaker 2:  so far, it doesn't seem like we're there yet that this is what

1055
01:08:07,565 --> 01:08:11,165
Speaker 2:  we have is like a meaningful new competitor, not an entire

1056
01:08:11,905 --> 01:08:15,005
Speaker 2:  new paradigm that is so much, drastically better than anything we've had

1057
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:19,045
Speaker 2:  before. Maybe we'll get there, maybe buying an ARM thing right

1058
01:08:19,045 --> 01:08:22,485
Speaker 2:  now is a smart future proofing decision as this stuff gets better. But it

1059
01:08:22,485 --> 01:08:25,845
Speaker 2:  doesn't sound like either of you would sort of going away say,

1060
01:08:26,355 --> 01:08:29,325
Speaker 2:  this is the obvious new future and everything else is going to be relegated

1061
01:08:29,325 --> 01:08:31,165
Speaker 2:  to the side quickly. Right? Is that fair?

1062
01:08:31,755 --> 01:08:35,405
Speaker 9:  It's definitely important to point out that the, the copilot plus stuff

1063
01:08:36,135 --> 01:08:40,045
Speaker 9:  isn't just arm true. Yeah. So there is gonna be Intel and a MD ones

1064
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:44,285
Speaker 9:  coming and even even like that listener who asked the question

1065
01:08:44,315 --> 01:08:47,285
Speaker 9:  like, is is this gonna be like a transition? There's gonna be a fire sale?

1066
01:08:47,705 --> 01:08:51,245
Speaker 9:  No. Like that's not really gonna happen because essentially the premium

1067
01:08:51,665 --> 01:08:55,365
Speaker 9:  end of the market is gonna be all copilot plus PCs from now on. Like that's

1068
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:59,125
Speaker 9:  just the, the standard thing apart from like maybe the gaming laptops are

1069
01:08:59,245 --> 01:09:02,485
Speaker 9:  slightly different, but even some of those are gonna be copilot PCs. We've,

1070
01:09:02,485 --> 01:09:04,165
Speaker 9:  we've seen those from Nvidia and a

1071
01:09:44,005 --> 01:09:46,485
Speaker 2:  still just like this much theoretical, we don't have quite the features.

1072
01:09:46,585 --> 01:09:47,525
Speaker 2:  We don't have Intel's

1073
01:10:12,485 --> 01:10:15,925
Speaker 2:  The Verge dot com. I'm gonna have a story about the Daylight DC one probably

1074
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:18,405
Speaker 2:  sometime this week. So keep an eye out for that. We'll put some links in

1075
01:10:18,405 --> 01:10:21,125
Speaker 2:  the show notes. But as always read The Verge dot com. It's a cool website.
