00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:36,245
Speaker 4:  Hello and Welcome. To Vergecast. The flagship podcast of 2023.

3
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:41,005
Speaker 4:  The whole year. When you think of 2023, you should think of the

4
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:44,525
Speaker 4:  Vergecast and you should tell your friends to think of it that way. I know

5
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:47,845
Speaker 4:  the people have been doing year in review packages. We've done them as well.

6
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:52,125
Speaker 4:  All of them are wrong because the only thing that happened in 2023 was

7
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:53,925
Speaker 4:  The Vergecast. Is that right Dave?

8
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:57,205
Speaker 5:  That's true. That is absolutely correct. The Vergecast wrapped is a thing

9
00:01:57,205 --> 00:01:59,965
Speaker 5:  that doesn't exist but Will in 2024. I promise

10
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:03,525
Speaker 4:  I don't, I don't wanna know. I'm your friend. Neli. That's David. Alex Kranz

11
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:06,685
Speaker 4:  is on vacation. Well deserved vacation already.

12
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:11,045
Speaker 4:  Our holiday wishes to her, but Richard Lawler is here to fill in. Hey Richard.

13
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:14,885
Speaker 4:  Hey. Good to be back. All, right. So this is our year-End Review

14
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:18,685
Speaker 4:  show. Unfortunately, the tech industry has decided to

15
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:22,325
Speaker 4:  chaotically fire out news at the end of the year. So here's what we're gonna

16
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:26,165
Speaker 4:  do. We're gonna do what David has titled A Year End Apple

17
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:29,995
Speaker 4:  Chaos, lightning Round. Then we're gonna have an actual

18
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:33,915
Speaker 4:  news focus lightning round, and then we're gonna go through our biggest

19
00:02:33,915 --> 00:02:37,715
Speaker 4:  stories of the year, which I'll, we'll when we get to it we'll explain

20
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:41,675
Speaker 4:  how we decided what they were. It's, it's surprising, but that's how we're

21
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:43,235
Speaker 4:  structuring the show. I think it'll be good. The

22
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:46,275
Speaker 5:  News is a lot like I just wanna say before we like, could everybody just

23
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:50,235
Speaker 5:  stop please. Like the last time we had a holiday, Sam. Malman

24
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:53,875
Speaker 5:  got fired. Like it's about to be Christmas. Can we just not like from

25
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:57,595
Speaker 5:  from now on, can we just, not for like two weeks

26
00:02:57,895 --> 00:02:58,995
Speaker 5:  please everybody. Yeah,

27
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,325
Speaker 4:  Just shut it down. Tur. This is, this is the problem with working from home

28
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:06,205
Speaker 4:  All, right? Let me just put it up there. Like a cranky old man. You're at

29
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:10,005
Speaker 4:  home now All, right? Stop working, stop doing things. No more calls.

30
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:10,845
Speaker 4:  Shut the laptop.

31
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:14,165
Speaker 5:  Go to the fun screen, not the work screen. It's time

32
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,965
Speaker 4:  All, right on that note. And then Twitter goes down in the middle of the

33
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,925
Speaker 4:  night. Yeah. Richard, I've never seen Richard actually like turn it all the

34
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:24,885
Speaker 4:  way off. I've known Richard for a very long time. All the way off is not

35
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:28,885
Speaker 4:  a setting that I, I think exists with Richard. Lawler, no All. right?

36
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:32,485
Speaker 4:  Let's start with the year end Apple chaos. There's a lot of year end apple

37
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:36,045
Speaker 4:  chaos. I think the biggest, most material bit

38
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:40,205
Speaker 4:  of Yearend Apple chaos news is whatever is going on with the Apple

39
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:41,405
Speaker 4:  Watch at the ITC.

40
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:42,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

41
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:44,565
Speaker 4:  David, can you quickly run us through this?

42
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:49,215
Speaker 5:  Sure. So the basic thing that is happening is

43
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:53,695
Speaker 5:  Apple lost a long running fight against a company called

44
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:57,255
Speaker 5:  Massimo, which makes medical devices about a sensor

45
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:00,935
Speaker 5:  for blood oxidization in the Apple Watch.

46
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:04,335
Speaker 5:  There's a lot of history there that we can talk about, much of which I think

47
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:08,055
Speaker 5:  is very interesting. But what it amounts to is that Apple lost

48
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:12,095
Speaker 5:  and the ITC, the International Trade Commission put in a,

49
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:16,175
Speaker 5:  an import ban, which would mean that Apple could not import and then

50
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:20,135
Speaker 5:  sell Apple watches. All recent Apple watches since the Apple Watch series

51
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:24,015
Speaker 5:  six except for the SE would be covered. So basically no new

52
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:27,935
Speaker 5:  Apple watches for Apple into the United States. Apple had

53
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:31,895
Speaker 5:  60 days since that ruling in October to either like come

54
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:35,815
Speaker 5:  to a deal with Massimo to get this done and sign a licensing agreement

55
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:39,655
Speaker 5:  or convince President Biden to veto the order that

56
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:43,455
Speaker 5:  expires December 25th, which is Christmas. And then on December 26th

57
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:47,415
Speaker 5:  the import ban takes effect. At this point, anything could still happen,

58
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:51,375
Speaker 5:  but pretty much everybody seems to think that by a mile the

59
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,895
Speaker 5:  most likely outcome is that come December 26th, apple is no longer going

60
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:58,375
Speaker 5:  to be allowed to sell most of its Apple Watch models in the United States.

61
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,895
Speaker 4:  So there's a few things to unpack here, which I think are interesting. One

62
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:05,855
Speaker 4:  is the long history between Apple and Massimo, which we can talk about. The

63
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:09,695
Speaker 4:  second, which people have directly asked me about is patent nerdery.

64
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:11,055
Speaker 4:  So I'll just, yeah,

65
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:13,775
Speaker 5:  That's why we had to do this here. Welcome To, The Vergecast, the flagship

66
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:14,855
Speaker 5:  podcast of Patent Nerd.

67
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:18,295
Speaker 4:  This is, this is what I'm here for. So let me just, I'll just do this part

68
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:21,695
Speaker 4:  very quickly. 'cause it, it's not actually that complicated this time. You

69
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:25,655
Speaker 4:  can feel however you want about the patent system, but in this case you have

70
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:29,575
Speaker 4:  it small US company that developed some technology, got some patents on

71
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:33,415
Speaker 4:  it. Then there's the wonky backstory with

72
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:36,935
Speaker 4:  Apple, which we can get into. But you know, a small US company made some

73
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:40,895
Speaker 4:  products, got some patents. The thing that has become the trend

74
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:44,695
Speaker 4:  in patent lawsuits, especially between tech companies over the last

75
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:48,295
Speaker 4:  decade is you file two patent lawsuits when you're mad.

76
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:51,815
Speaker 4:  One is a regular old patent infringement case in federal court. The other

77
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,775
Speaker 4:  is a patent infringement case at the International Trade Commission, which

78
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:58,725
Speaker 4:  is an executive agency that regulates what comes into the country.

79
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:02,965
Speaker 4:  And the reason you do that, the reason it's popular is 'cause we don't make

80
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:06,885
Speaker 4:  a lot of things in America. That's just the truth. Yeah.

81
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:10,965
Speaker 4:  So if you are Apple suing Samsung or Samsung suing Apple back in the

82
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:14,685
Speaker 4:  day, you are running this fast track parallel patent

83
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:18,325
Speaker 4:  infringement litigation at the ITC to ban your

84
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:21,765
Speaker 4:  competitors' phones from entering the United States. 'cause that's gonna

85
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:25,285
Speaker 4:  create a lot of leverage for you in a settlement or a negotiation or whatever.

86
00:06:26,065 --> 00:06:28,725
Speaker 4:  So that is the trend. Every time you see a patent infringement lawsuit, especially

87
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:30,885
Speaker 4:  when one of the companies involved, or both the companies involved have a

88
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:34,365
Speaker 4:  big offshore manufacturing presence and they need to import goods in the

89
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:38,165
Speaker 4:  United States, the ITC gets involved. Sonos and Google ITC involved,

90
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:42,405
Speaker 4:  famously Apple and Samsung ITC was involved

91
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:46,405
Speaker 4:  and Samsung actually won at the ITC against Apple was gonna prevent

92
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:49,515
Speaker 4:  iPhones from being imported. And the

93
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:53,795
Speaker 4:  Obama administration stepped in and said, no, we're gonna

94
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,515
Speaker 4:  veto this one. And in that case, you see there's like a nationalistic impulsive

95
00:06:57,545 --> 00:07:00,075
Speaker 4:  play. You have an American company, you have a Korean company. The White

96
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:03,795
Speaker 4:  House is like, we're gonna let the American company win. In this case, something

97
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:06,875
Speaker 4:  that's very different is you have a small American company and you have a

98
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:10,675
Speaker 4:  giant American multinational. It does not seem like the Biden

99
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:13,395
Speaker 4:  administration wants to pick sides here. It's like not an easy

100
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:18,395
Speaker 4:  win. Like no one's waving a flag when you let Apple crush

101
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:21,755
Speaker 4:  the small company. It just doesn't, doesn't seem like it's gonna happen.

102
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:25,555
Speaker 4:  So that's the, just the shape of it, right? The ICC is this place

103
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:29,835
Speaker 4:  where a lot of parallel patent litigation happens. 'cause it's

104
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:33,795
Speaker 4:  faster and because you can quickly get to a very damaging

105
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:37,675
Speaker 4:  result, which is banning imports, which creates a lot of leverage. And now

106
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:39,075
Speaker 4:  Masimo has that leverage.

107
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:42,995
Speaker 5:  The ITC is not a legal system, right? It's not like writing laws

108
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:46,115
Speaker 5:  and judges at the end of it. It's just like a, it's just like a bunch of

109
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:49,355
Speaker 5:  people who make a decision that has this gigantic effect you're talking about.

110
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:49,835
Speaker 5:  but it's not like

111
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:52,595
Speaker 4:  It's a court, it's an administrative court. It's a, it's a different kind

112
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:55,875
Speaker 4:  of court. You can get all the way down some real law school stuff.

113
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:59,755
Speaker 4:  It's not a court in the judicial branch, it's an administrative court and

114
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:02,995
Speaker 4:  it, they work a little bit differently, but it's a court like it ha it does

115
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:06,875
Speaker 4:  that thing. So that, that's the, that's what's happened here,

116
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:10,915
Speaker 4:  right? There's been this patent litigation, I'm

117
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:14,035
Speaker 4:  sure the sort of federal court patent litigation will continue to wind its

118
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,195
Speaker 4:  way through the court system. But Massima one at the ITC said

119
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:20,915
Speaker 4:  basically the policy of the United States is we don't allow people to import

120
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:24,475
Speaker 4:  goods that are infringing the patents of companies that operate in the United States.

121
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:28,915
Speaker 4:  Okay? Like you under like broadly patent system aside, you understand why

122
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:32,275
Speaker 4:  that's the policy. You wanna punish people for violating patents, especially

123
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:35,235
Speaker 4:  people who might be manufacturing their goods offshore or not paying all

124
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:39,025
Speaker 4:  that. Like you see where that's coming from. Okay. Apple has to

125
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:43,005
Speaker 4:  contend with that and it's what's amazing to me about this, and David, I

126
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:45,965
Speaker 4:  think this is where the backstory is really interesting. They haven't just

127
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:49,765
Speaker 4:  paid the money to mass enough. They haven't just bought the company or paid

128
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:53,685
Speaker 4:  the licensing fee. They've been waging war against a small company

129
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:54,125
Speaker 4:  for like a

130
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,885
Speaker 5:  Decade. Yeah. This goes back back to 2013 and the, the very short

131
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:01,525
Speaker 5:  version of the backstory is when Apple decided it wanted to start

132
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:05,365
Speaker 5:  doing the blood oxygen stuff in the Apple watch, it contacted

133
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:09,245
Speaker 5:  Massimo as as a possible partner. And both sides agreed that

134
00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:11,765
Speaker 5:  that is a thing that happened that the two companies talked to each other.

135
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:15,165
Speaker 5:  And then from there Massimo's argument is essentially Apple

136
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:19,165
Speaker 5:  hired, I think it was their chief medical officer. Yeah. And a bunch of our

137
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:22,885
Speaker 5:  employees and a bunch of our engineers and essentially just ripped off our

138
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:26,085
Speaker 5:  technology whole hog and put it into the Apple Watch

139
00:09:26,835 --> 00:09:30,285
Speaker 5:  Apple's version is we met with Massimo, decided

140
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:34,445
Speaker 5:  that it wasn't gonna be what we wanted it to be. They weren't close

141
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:37,845
Speaker 5:  enough to a consumer device. So we went a different direction and then

142
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:42,085
Speaker 5:  hired Massimo's chief medical Officer and a lot of engineers

143
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:46,085
Speaker 5:  and staff and built very similar versions of its technology. So the, the

144
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,845
Speaker 5:  sides are like far apart in a certain way, but not that far

145
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:53,645
Speaker 5:  apart in a certain way. and it seems like what has happened at this point,

146
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:57,365
Speaker 5:  I was watching a bunch of interviews with Joe Keani who's Masimo CEO and

147
00:09:57,385 --> 00:10:01,365
Speaker 5:  he is like bought in on this idea that Apple is not an

148
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:05,325
Speaker 5:  innovative company and needs to be shown to the world to be the

149
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:08,605
Speaker 5:  non-innovative company that it really is. And Apple's also having this fight

150
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:12,525
Speaker 5:  with a Live Corps about some of the EKG stuff that was going on. And he

151
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:16,445
Speaker 5:  is out here being like, I have spent $60 million over a decade on this litigation

152
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:20,205
Speaker 5:  and I'm going to win to prove to the world that Apple is not the company

153
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:24,125
Speaker 5:  that it claims to be. Apple meanwhile is the largest and most resourced

154
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,285
Speaker 5:  company on planet Earth. And the general

155
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:31,845
Speaker 5:  consensus of the reason that no one at Apple's side has come

156
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:35,165
Speaker 5:  to the table here is that Apple doesn't want to give people incentive to

157
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:38,925
Speaker 5:  sue them. Yeah. And if, if you can sue your way into getting

158
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:42,565
Speaker 5:  bought by Apple or getting paid off by Apple, people will do it.

159
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:46,685
Speaker 5:  And I think those, if if you take those two things, there's just no

160
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:48,285
Speaker 5:  space in between them. Just none.

161
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:52,445
Speaker 4:  There's a little bit of space. Is there, there's a little bit of space.

162
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:53,245
Speaker 5:  What

163
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:56,885
Speaker 4:  Is that space? It's not a ton of space. And I, I've covered

164
00:10:56,975 --> 00:11:00,965
Speaker 4:  Apple patent litigation for a long time in many ways. Apple v Samsung

165
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:05,565
Speaker 4:  is the new story that helped The Verge become The Verge. Like it was,

166
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:09,845
Speaker 4:  it was a thing that drove a lot of our early traffic and interest. So I've

167
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:13,765
Speaker 4:  spent a lot of time covering Apple patent stuff and talking to

168
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:17,485
Speaker 4:  Apple folks. They are religious that they don't steal anything, that

169
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:20,525
Speaker 4:  everyone else is a bad actor and that everyone wants money. Right. And that

170
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,525
Speaker 4:  Apple's gonna come and I get it. I really get it. And you can see how this

171
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:28,285
Speaker 4:  gets expressed in all kinds of ways. Apple hates

172
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:31,965
Speaker 4:  Qualcomm, they hate this company. Yeah. And it's because

173
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:35,085
Speaker 4:  Qualcomm runs a bunch of patent licensing schemes. They own all the patents

174
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:38,605
Speaker 4:  to 5G. Apple doesn't want to pay 'em. Right. They sued each other. The

175
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:42,405
Speaker 4:  lawsuits were really snippy. Apple went out and bought Intel's modem

176
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:46,325
Speaker 4:  division so they could get away from Qualcomm. That is an incredible bet.

177
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:50,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Apple's apple has like whole billion dollar

178
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:54,125
Speaker 5:  divisions of its company that are just set up as petty counters to

179
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:58,005
Speaker 4:  Other companies failing divisions. Yeah. Like if you'll remember, Intel

180
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:02,485
Speaker 4:  failed to build a 5G modem and Apple bought the failed

181
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:06,605
Speaker 4:  modem division from Intel on the theory that they would just

182
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:10,755
Speaker 4:  manage those people better. That's crazy. You only

183
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:14,075
Speaker 4:  do that if you're like blinded by petty rage.

184
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:17,755
Speaker 4:  It's someone else believing that they had invented something that you needed.

185
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:21,595
Speaker 4:  And so that's Qualcomm. And I think people look at their attitude towards

186
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:24,035
Speaker 4:  Samsung or Qualcomm and they're like, these are giants fighting. What are

187
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,995
Speaker 4:  they doing? You get down to the smaller companies who feel aggrieved and

188
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:31,875
Speaker 4:  Apple runs the same playbook. And I think it comes out looking very differently.

189
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:36,565
Speaker 4:  Right. We met with this small company, we saw their technology, we went and

190
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:39,485
Speaker 4:  instead of having to pay the premium to buy the company, we just paid a premium

191
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:42,445
Speaker 4:  for all the people. Right. I think in one of the stories, Joe Keani says

192
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:45,565
Speaker 4:  the chief medical officer, like they tripled his payday or something. So

193
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,845
Speaker 4:  they just spent a bunch of money on people. They they took the company away

194
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:52,565
Speaker 4:  from him and they took his technology and he's been fighting his patent lawsuit.

195
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:56,045
Speaker 4:  And Apple's belief is that it can just win in court over and over and over

196
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:56,925
Speaker 4:  again. Right. And

197
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:59,685
Speaker 5:  This is a story that startups tell about big companies all the

198
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:03,355
Speaker 4:  Time, every day, every company. Yeah. Yeah. I look at this and I look at

199
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:06,955
Speaker 4:  Apple getting all the way to this moment

200
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:11,435
Speaker 4:  where they have preemptively announced they're not gonna sell the Apple Watch.

201
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:15,155
Speaker 4:  The ban isn't in effect, it's just the week before Christmas. They should

202
00:13:15,155 --> 00:13:18,995
Speaker 4:  be selling every Apple Watch they can. The way Apple announced it, super

203
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:22,645
Speaker 4:  weird, super weird. If your apple

204
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:26,845
Speaker 4:  and your it's Christmas and the Apple Watch is one of your,

205
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:30,925
Speaker 4:  is like the ultimate Apple Christmas gift, right? You need to sell as many

206
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:34,565
Speaker 4:  watches as you can. This is extremely material information that your

207
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:38,725
Speaker 4:  Q4 results will be impacted by not having the ability to

208
00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:42,445
Speaker 4:  sell the Apple Watch. That is, that should be a press release.

209
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:46,925
Speaker 4:  That should be an eight k filed with the SEC. Like you should

210
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:50,605
Speaker 4:  be informing investors in the biggest, most official way you can. And Apple

211
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:54,365
Speaker 4:  didn't do that. They gave a background quote to nine to five Mac, which is

212
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:58,245
Speaker 4:  great. I I love nine to five Mac my, all of my criticism here is

213
00:13:58,345 --> 00:14:02,205
Speaker 4:  for Apple. Yeah. That is an insane way to announce this

214
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:05,485
Speaker 4:  news. And my belief is they announced it that way. 'cause they didn't want

215
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:08,365
Speaker 4:  to seem important. They wanted to raise the pressure on the Biden administration.

216
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:12,205
Speaker 4:  They wanted this veto and they're, I don't think they're gonna get it. And

217
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:15,565
Speaker 4:  they're gonna have to contend with the Apple watch not being on sale unless

218
00:14:15,565 --> 00:14:19,485
Speaker 4:  they buy this company pay a settlement whose premium is rising every

219
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:23,285
Speaker 4:  single day. Every day the Apple Watch isn't on sale is the day that

220
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:27,125
Speaker 4:  Massimo is like winning. Right? Like the, the price

221
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:30,765
Speaker 4:  increases for from Massimo's side every day the Apple Watch is on sale. And

222
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:34,685
Speaker 4:  what's even crazier about this, Joe from Massimo keeps saying this

223
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:38,165
Speaker 4:  in every interview. He keeps saying it takes two to tango, which is just

224
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:41,085
Speaker 4:  an amazing thing to say. He's like, I'm willing, like I will accept the money

225
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:44,565
Speaker 4:  they have to show up and offer it to me. Right. And they, they won't.

226
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:48,285
Speaker 4:  And I, I think Apple's just backed itself into a weird kind of corner here

227
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:51,775
Speaker 4:  where they should have just bought this company 10 years ago and, And we

228
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:53,495
Speaker 4:  would've ne no one would've ever heard about any of this.

229
00:14:53,755 --> 00:14:57,575
Speaker 6:  And I, I think your explanation of it being religion is the only one that

230
00:14:57,575 --> 00:15:00,815
Speaker 6:  makes sense here. Because when you think about it, how could Apple have possibly

231
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:04,655
Speaker 6:  have let it get this far? It just, it just, it boggles my mind to think

232
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,375
Speaker 6:  that they didn't take care of this before, that they didn't deal with this.

233
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:10,735
Speaker 6:  Whether you're worried about being sued by other companies or who else might

234
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:14,065
Speaker 6:  follow a precedent, anything like that. They're getting sued all the time.

235
00:15:14,095 --> 00:15:17,585
Speaker 6:  That is already happening there. There's just, there's no reason to do this

236
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:19,145
Speaker 6:  logically. Yeah.

237
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:19,585
Speaker 4:  It,

238
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:23,785
Speaker 5:  It, it does seem like there is a certain version of

239
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:27,665
Speaker 5:  this set of events that it never gets to this. Right. Like,

240
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:32,265
Speaker 5:  the part of the reason this is so shocking is that we went through all these

241
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:36,265
Speaker 5:  steps and, and Richard, one of the things I'm curious about is how much

242
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:39,185
Speaker 5:  you've been sort of aware of this story over the last 12 months because it's

243
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:41,665
Speaker 5:  been lingering for a long time. Like they've been fighting about this for

244
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:45,665
Speaker 5:  a decade. And yet I personally was fully out

245
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:48,945
Speaker 5:  of the blue shocked by the news that this was happening because every time

246
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:51,785
Speaker 5:  you turn around and it's like, oh, a company's suing Apple, apple will eventually

247
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,265
Speaker 5:  write them a check and we'll never hear about it again. This is what happens

248
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:57,465
Speaker 5:  over and over. The fact that anybody talked about it at all is surprising.

249
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:00,145
Speaker 5:  And then every step gets a little more surprising, but eventually it's like

250
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:03,145
Speaker 5:  they're either gonna write the check or settle in some other way and we'll

251
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:06,945
Speaker 5:  all move on with our lives. So to me it's like, it it's the fact

252
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:10,785
Speaker 5:  that it, the fact that it came out of nowhere, even

253
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:14,265
Speaker 5:  that it absolutely did not come out of nowhere is what's so telling to me

254
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:18,625
Speaker 5:  that it's like of this is so, such an unusual outcome of an incredibly

255
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,705
Speaker 5:  common thing that I think if I'm Apple, I bet nobody at Apple thought it

256
00:16:21,705 --> 00:16:25,585
Speaker 5:  would get this far up, up to an potentially including the day of the ban.

257
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:29,385
Speaker 5:  I bet most people at Apple are like, it it will will win, it'll be fine.

258
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:32,345
Speaker 6:  And I think you're exactly right. That's pretty much how I was thinking about

259
00:16:32,345 --> 00:16:35,985
Speaker 6:  it. I was aware of it just like I was aware of a number of other lawsuits

260
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:38,945
Speaker 6:  that are winding their way through the system involving Apple. You have all

261
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:41,905
Speaker 6:  the class action lawsuits. You have all the patent lawsuits, you have everyone

262
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:46,065
Speaker 6:  ever saying that they invented the action button before you got it on your

263
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:49,895
Speaker 6:  iPhone 15 Pro. Yeah. Yeah. but it never, it never

264
00:16:49,895 --> 00:16:53,015
Speaker 6:  turns into anything or very rarely turns into anything. And then this one

265
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:56,655
Speaker 6:  just dropped one day. It was like, oh, by the way, if you want an Apple watch,

266
00:16:56,655 --> 00:16:57,455
Speaker 6:  you should get it soon.

267
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:00,735
Speaker 5:  Yeah. My favorite conspiracy theory about all of this, by the way, is that,

268
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:03,695
Speaker 5:  is everybody saying like, oh, this is actually gonna be awesome for Apple's

269
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:07,695
Speaker 5:  Q4 because everybody's gonna rush out to buy an Apple watch before

270
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:08,655
Speaker 5:  it leaves shelves.

271
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:12,095
Speaker 4:  What a vote of no confidence in Apple's business development or legal teams.

272
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:15,375
Speaker 4:  And you're like, this will improve sales because everyone will rush out.

273
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,735
Speaker 4:  You're like, because Apple's lawyers will continue to lose this fight. Yeah.

274
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:22,935
Speaker 4:  Tim Cook won't just write the check Like, don don't know man.

275
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:26,815
Speaker 4:  The, it's a weird story. Every part of it is weird. It was weird 10 years

276
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,775
Speaker 4:  ago. It's weird because Apple's religion is weird. People

277
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,855
Speaker 4:  sue Apple every day. Right. You're not by settling the one case where

278
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:38,775
Speaker 4:  there's merit or will the will get this far regardless of opinion

279
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:42,695
Speaker 4:  on merit. It's not like you're gonna encourage other people to show up. They're

280
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,895
Speaker 4:  already there. You're already the richest company in the world. Like you're

281
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:49,805
Speaker 4:  the fattest target There is. Yeah. So I. It, it just, it's a,

282
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:53,645
Speaker 4:  it's a weird dynamic to think more people will wanna

283
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:56,325
Speaker 4:  sue you. Like there's no one left. They're already suing you.

284
00:17:57,435 --> 00:18:00,045
Speaker 4:  Like if you wake up one day and you're like, you know what, I'm gonna be

285
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,845
Speaker 4:  a patent troll today. The first thing on your mind is how do you sue Apple?

286
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:07,365
Speaker 4:  And that is fi it's like whatever. It's part of the system. But there, there

287
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:11,335
Speaker 4:  comes a point where you had 60 days to negotiate

288
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:14,775
Speaker 4:  the settlement before the thing wouldn't go on sale. And you banked it on

289
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:19,135
Speaker 4:  Biden showing up and having an opinion on whether the Apple watch should

290
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:22,695
Speaker 4:  be on sale. don don't like, have you, you been paying attention to this dude?

291
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:25,095
Speaker 4:  Like, doesn't seem likely.

292
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:26,975
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's weird.

293
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:30,735
Speaker 4:  Like, like Biden's out there giving interviews on whether President Trump

294
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:34,775
Speaker 4:  did an insurrection. There are like two, like even if you think he's

295
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:38,765
Speaker 4:  checked in, whether the Apple Watch on sale is

296
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:42,565
Speaker 4:  on his list of things to be paying attention to far down any list that

297
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:45,565
Speaker 4:  anyone would make the things that President of United States should be paying

298
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:49,405
Speaker 4:  attention to at this moment in time. So I. The the whole thing is

299
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:52,765
Speaker 4:  weird. Yeah. Last minute Apple chaos. Anyway, it's Christmas. Go buy an Apple

300
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:53,365
Speaker 4:  watch before.

301
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:59,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I, Becky's doesn't listen to the show I bought. She got a new

302
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:02,045
Speaker 4:  one for Christmas. And I will tell you this, one of the the funniest things

303
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:05,845
Speaker 4:  I, she only got her 'cause she has a six, she has a series five or series

304
00:19:05,865 --> 00:19:09,445
Speaker 4:  six. It's dying. Like the battery's dying. It's several years old. I bought

305
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:12,125
Speaker 4:  her the new one, I bought her a nine and I was like, oh this is just not

306
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:12,485
Speaker 4:  different.

307
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:17,205
Speaker 5:  No, they are remarkably the same. To the point where I had to take mine off

308
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:20,805
Speaker 5:  and look at it today to remember which one that I had like this. This is

309
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:21,365
Speaker 5:  just where we are

310
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:25,325
Speaker 4:  And what's actually funny, Victoria's song has pointed this out over and

311
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:28,925
Speaker 4:  over again. Our coverage, the blood oxygen sensor and Apple Watch is not

312
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:29,565
Speaker 4:  that useful.

313
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:30,205
Speaker 5:  No,

314
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:34,955
Speaker 4:  It just doesn't do a lot. So what, what do we do? But if

315
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:37,475
Speaker 6:  You have an old one, you should keep it around just in case it's useful for

316
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:37,955
Speaker 6:  iMessage later.

317
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:41,875
Speaker 4:  All. right. Let's get to that. Let's talk about Beeper. Eventually you're

318
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,475
Speaker 4:  gonna have to jailbreak iPhone. No, eventually you're gonna have to

319
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,635
Speaker 4:  jailbreak an Apple watch and wear it around your neck to use Beeper. That's

320
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:50,115
Speaker 4:  that's where we're going. David, what's going on here?

321
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:53,915
Speaker 5:  This makes me so sad. So we've been covering the, the

322
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:57,995
Speaker 5:  Beeper versus iMessage thing for the last few weeks. And I think

323
00:19:57,995 --> 00:20:01,275
Speaker 5:  at this point I feel pretty good about pronouncing it over.

324
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:05,235
Speaker 5:  So people said at the beginning of this week that they had yet another fix

325
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:09,235
Speaker 5:  for the iMessage blue bubble on Android thing that they've been

326
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:12,975
Speaker 5:  working on and announced the fix. and it is

327
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:17,655
Speaker 5:  so ridiculous as to be more or less sort of unusable for most people.

328
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:22,655
Speaker 5:  Basically the way that it's working is, is by connecting to a

329
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,495
Speaker 5:  device. It can register, it can register your

330
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,335
Speaker 5:  phone number as an iMessage number if and only if you have an iPhone

331
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,895
Speaker 5:  or a Mac, which I would point out is exactly how it already worked.

332
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:38,175
Speaker 5:  And so we've just kind of come all the way back around to where we were and

333
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,015
Speaker 5:  their solution is literally like, it, it's gotten to the point where they'll

334
00:20:42,015 --> 00:20:45,655
Speaker 5:  say, they're saying ask a friend who has an iPhone

335
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:49,505
Speaker 5:  to give you the registration code so that we can get into their system

336
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,985
Speaker 5:  because that's the unique number that we need. They won't have access to

337
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,905
Speaker 5:  your iMessages, but every once in a while they're gonna get a new code to

338
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:58,065
Speaker 5:  keep the registration going. And they're gonna have to give you that too.

339
00:20:58,565 --> 00:21:02,065
Speaker 5:  Or you can have an old iPhone, which I'm sure tons of Android users have

340
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:05,625
Speaker 5:  around, or, and this is the best one. You can rent an iPhone

341
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:09,145
Speaker 5:  from Beeper, which is a thing that they're considering doing. Like this just,

342
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:12,545
Speaker 5:  it just doesn't work. Right. Like Beeper lost. And, and you can feel about

343
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:16,505
Speaker 5:  that however you'd like to feel about that Beeper lost. And I think it's

344
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:20,385
Speaker 5:  very clear now that what beeper's pushing towards is being like

345
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:24,225
Speaker 5:  a martyr for a greater cause of fighting against Apple. And

346
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:28,465
Speaker 5:  Eric Makovsky, the, the CEO was on, I

347
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:31,025
Speaker 5:  forget one of the morning shows talking about this. I think it was CBS this

348
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:34,985
Speaker 5:  morning talking about this a a bunch of Congress people wrote

349
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:39,025
Speaker 5:  a letter about, you know, the antitrust implications of iMessage.

350
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:42,265
Speaker 5:  And so there's this like, political fight starting that don don't think is

351
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:45,225
Speaker 5:  actually gonna go anywhere. 'cause don don't think the merits of this particular

352
00:21:45,255 --> 00:21:49,225
Speaker 5:  case are particularly strong. But one of the

353
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,065
Speaker 5:  first times I talked to Eric about this, I asked him like, is there a version

354
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:55,425
Speaker 5:  of this story where you become a martyr for a greater cause and are you okay

355
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:57,825
Speaker 5:  with that being the end? And he was like, that's not what's gonna happen.

356
00:21:57,965 --> 00:21:59,905
Speaker 5:  And I was write that is what happened. I'm sorry

357
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:04,395
Speaker 4:  I read that letter. You know, I want to

358
00:22:04,395 --> 00:22:07,635
Speaker 4:  have a high opinion over our government. You know, like as, as a citizen

359
00:22:07,735 --> 00:22:11,635
Speaker 4:  of America, I I I truly want to believe that we can

360
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:14,395
Speaker 4:  get back to having an effective government. I read that letter and I was

361
00:22:14,395 --> 00:22:16,935
Speaker 4:  like, have you any of you ever used a computer?

362
00:22:18,475 --> 00:22:22,295
Speaker 4:  Do you, do you have them? Are are you, you ever

363
00:22:22,295 --> 00:22:26,215
Speaker 4:  turn one on you ever, you ever see how like they're using

364
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:29,775
Speaker 4:  Apple's computers without permission? Right? That's what's going on here.

365
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:33,935
Speaker 4:  It's not, this is pretty straightforward and you can believe

366
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:37,815
Speaker 4:  that Apple should make iMessage more interoperable. I believe that you

367
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:41,775
Speaker 4:  can believe that green bubbles and blue bubbles are causing an epidemic of

368
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:45,775
Speaker 4:  weird bullying in America schools. I believe that you can believe

369
00:22:45,775 --> 00:22:49,335
Speaker 4:  that Apple has a moral obligation to allow for

370
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:53,095
Speaker 4:  encrypted messaging between iPhone users and Android users without,

371
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:56,505
Speaker 4:  you know, saying something like, go use WhatsApp and set like you, you can

372
00:22:56,505 --> 00:23:00,425
Speaker 4:  believe all these things ages ago before Dieter went to work for

373
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:03,665
Speaker 4:  Google, while he still worked here, he wrote a story for us called The Moral

374
00:23:03,665 --> 00:23:07,585
Speaker 4:  Case for bringing iMessage to Android. Right. You can believe all of those

375
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:10,265
Speaker 4:  things. That's a great piece. You should read it again. It it

376
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:12,745
Speaker 5:  Holds up really well. I read it while writing about Beeper and it is everything

377
00:23:12,745 --> 00:23:14,345
Speaker 5:  he says is still true. Yeah.

378
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:18,345
Speaker 4:  It, you can believe all these things you do not have to believe that requires

379
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:22,305
Speaker 4:  Apple to let people hack their systems like it

380
00:23:22,565 --> 00:23:26,385
Speaker 4:  or find a these workarounds. Like there, there's just

381
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:30,145
Speaker 4:  something in there that I, the moral argument for letting Beeper work in

382
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:34,105
Speaker 4:  the way that Beeper works is just weird. Right? It's

383
00:23:34,105 --> 00:23:38,085
Speaker 4:  like it's a little too uncomfortable beyond, we

384
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:41,365
Speaker 4:  should put some pressure on Apple to make the system more interoperable.

385
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:45,005
Speaker 4:  But if that's what you're pegging it on is they found a 16-year-old kid found

386
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,015
Speaker 4:  a hack. Like you're just in, you're just in dicey territory from

387
00:23:49,015 --> 00:23:52,325
Speaker 4:  the jump. And by the way, I really do believe Apple should make iMessage

388
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:55,645
Speaker 4:  interoperable. I think everything should be interoperable, but it just, this

389
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:58,795
Speaker 4:  one is like it's Apple resolved it without a lawsuit.

390
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:03,005
Speaker 4:  That's, that's actually probably the most notable thing here. They just cat

391
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:05,925
Speaker 4:  and mouse Beeper out of the game without ever sending the mean letter,

392
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:09,525
Speaker 4:  which based on what we were just talking about, it's like very admirable

393
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:13,365
Speaker 4:  for Apple. Yeah. They, they did not use, I

394
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:16,965
Speaker 4:  assumed that we would get a computer fraud and abuse Act

395
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:19,905
Speaker 4:  letter, but they just shut it down. Yeah.

396
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:23,065
Speaker 5:  Richard, what do you make of this? I feel like I, I I've talked to myself

397
00:24:23,065 --> 00:24:26,625
Speaker 5:  in circles now for like three weeks about, I think

398
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:30,625
Speaker 5:  Beeper is right about everything except whether it is and should

399
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,545
Speaker 5:  be allowed to do what it's doing. And ultimately that's the only thing that

400
00:24:33,545 --> 00:24:37,185
Speaker 5:  matters to me. But I, I'm super curious what you think having followed all

401
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:37,785
Speaker 5:  of this that

402
00:24:37,785 --> 00:24:41,425
Speaker 6:  Is the stickiest part about this, is that what Beeper is actually doing,

403
00:24:41,425 --> 00:24:45,145
Speaker 6:  they're pretending to be iPhones or Macs. They've figured out a way to do

404
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:48,025
Speaker 6:  that and Apple figured out a way to undo that.

405
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:52,425
Speaker 6:  And I don't think either party is wrong. It's, it's great that they've tried

406
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:56,025
Speaker 6:  to do it and Apple is certainly within their right to say, Hey, this device

407
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:59,745
Speaker 6:  that is on our messaging system is not actually an iPhone or Mac

408
00:24:59,905 --> 00:25:03,545
Speaker 6:  that has been activated. It shouldn't be allowed to do that. And the kind

409
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:06,745
Speaker 6:  of the solution that they've come to where you are actually using

410
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:11,185
Speaker 6:  an iPhone or Mac is probably one that I guess Apple

411
00:25:11,415 --> 00:25:15,185
Speaker 6:  doesn't really have a way around and that they, they could use. But it's

412
00:25:15,185 --> 00:25:18,865
Speaker 6:  so ridiculous. This is not what any anyone wants. This is not a service that

413
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:22,025
Speaker 6:  people want to pay for as, as they were suggesting it. And

414
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:26,025
Speaker 6:  ultimately I think everyone's unsatisfied being an Android user never having

415
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:29,745
Speaker 6:  had an iPhone. The most surprising part of this whole news is when I opened

416
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:33,705
Speaker 6:  up my iPad and found out that I have nine iMessage messages in

417
00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:36,745
Speaker 6:  storage somehow. And I don't know how that happened.

418
00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:40,785
Speaker 6:  So that, that is a mystery that still has not been solved. And if anyone

419
00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:41,625
Speaker 6:  at Beeper or Apple, no

420
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,505
Speaker 4:  Richard I don would like to I don, I don't know how to say this to you, but

421
00:25:43,895 --> 00:25:46,905
Speaker 4:  I've been using your iPad to spoof iMessage for some time now.

422
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:54,185
Speaker 6:  I should have known, I should have known that. That explains

423
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,025
Speaker 6:  a lot of weird messages. I've kidding.

424
00:25:57,185 --> 00:26:00,525
Speaker 4:  And it, you know, the funniest thing about this is Apple, you know, they

425
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:04,365
Speaker 4:  caved to Europe. They're gonna do RCS, they've talked about doing

426
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:08,355
Speaker 4:  encrypted RCS, they've talked about other extensions of rrc s

427
00:26:08,355 --> 00:26:10,955
Speaker 4:  to make rich messages with video and photos better.

428
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:16,235
Speaker 4:  We're very close to getting what you want out of Apple here.

429
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:19,975
Speaker 4:  Right, right. Like to what End

430
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:21,895
Speaker 4:  does actually making iMessage itself

431
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:26,235
Speaker 4:  like forcibly interoperate with just one app

432
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:28,015
Speaker 4:  accomplish very much.

433
00:26:29,575 --> 00:26:33,485
Speaker 5:  Again, I think it would be great. I like Beeper as a user experience a

434
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:36,925
Speaker 5:  lot. I I was able, I piped in like 10 different

435
00:26:37,035 --> 00:26:40,885
Speaker 5:  inboxes into Beeper and it is like a saner way to message It's great.

436
00:26:41,705 --> 00:26:45,125
Speaker 5:  No one is obligated to support that. Right. And I that's fine.

437
00:26:45,665 --> 00:26:49,525
Speaker 5:  And and I think you're right. Like if you boil Eric and Bieber's like moral

438
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:53,605
Speaker 5:  argument all the way down, what they say is SMS is bad

439
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:57,485
Speaker 5:  technology and Apple is doing its users a disservice by relying on it. I

440
00:26:57,485 --> 00:27:00,925
Speaker 5:  think that is absolutely true and I think RCS is the correct

441
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:05,165
Speaker 5:  solution to that problem. Not Beeper, which is the problem, right? Like

442
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:08,805
Speaker 5:  even the case Beeper wants to make doesn't end in and the right

443
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:13,125
Speaker 5:  solution is Beeper it ends in and the right solution is this better technology

444
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:15,805
Speaker 5:  that we've invented that works for everyone. Yeah.

445
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:19,725
Speaker 6:  No, the right solution is to take it back to when we had that one app that

446
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:23,605
Speaker 6:  had me, MSN Messenger and aol Instant Messenger and IRC Trillium

447
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:27,285
Speaker 6:  What what we have iic. Yes. Trillium. Yeah. That's, that is the solutions.

448
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:28,325
Speaker 6:  Those are the base. That is where we need to

449
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:29,845
Speaker 5:  Go. Trillium, ADIO, pigeon

450
00:27:30,785 --> 00:27:31,205
Speaker 4:  Pigeon,

451
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:32,085
Speaker 5:  What a world.

452
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:35,125
Speaker 6:  None of them could spell any words correctly. That's the thing they all had.

453
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:35,645
Speaker 6:  I know

454
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:36,725
Speaker 5:  It's shouldn't have been Ice

455
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:43,165
Speaker 4:  All. right? So our condolences to Beeper, hopefully one day

456
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:46,765
Speaker 4:  there's Blue Bubbles for everyone. Till that time you can buy an iPhone and

457
00:27:46,785 --> 00:27:50,645
Speaker 4:  use Beeper on your Android phone. We got there. You won

458
00:27:50,645 --> 00:27:54,165
Speaker 4:  Again, Tim Cook, you crafted Devil other little bit of Apple News,

459
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:58,085
Speaker 4:  lots of smoke but no fire yet on a Vision Pro launch

460
00:27:58,265 --> 00:28:01,605
Speaker 4:  in February, potentially late January. This makes sense.

461
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:05,645
Speaker 4:  Just if you think about the next few weeks here, it's gonna be CES very soon

462
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:10,245
Speaker 4:  a terrifying reality. Apple loves to disrupt

463
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:14,205
Speaker 4:  CES So saying we're gonna have an event in late January,

464
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:17,845
Speaker 4:  early February during the second week of January when CSS is going,

465
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:22,445
Speaker 4:  pretty good timing for Apple. Yeah. And then they, they have said early

466
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:26,405
Speaker 4:  24 for the Vision Pro since the very beginning. So we'll see.

467
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:29,885
Speaker 4:  I, you know, I I think does this thing have a killer? Have they have, has

468
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:33,035
Speaker 4:  Apple figured out what the Vision Pro is for yet? I don Dunno,

469
00:28:33,095 --> 00:28:36,995
Speaker 5:  The answer seems to be spatial video. Right? Like I feel like this has the,

470
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:39,995
Speaker 5:  been the most interesting thing about the last month or so is we've seen

471
00:28:39,995 --> 00:28:43,675
Speaker 5:  this trickle of stories come out from people who have tried

472
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:48,035
Speaker 5:  shooting spatial video and on the iPhone and then seeing it Yeah. On the

473
00:28:48,035 --> 00:28:51,675
Speaker 5:  Vision Pro. And that just, at least from

474
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:55,395
Speaker 5:  Apple's perspective, seems to be overwhelmingly the first

475
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:59,275
Speaker 5:  thing Apple would like to tell you about the Vision Pro. I

476
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:03,475
Speaker 5:  am very skeptical. I mean, some of the headlines you see are absurd. People

477
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:07,275
Speaker 5:  are like, I was moved to tears by seeing Yeah. My photos in the vision. It's

478
00:29:07,275 --> 00:29:10,035
Speaker 5:  like, I bet I probably not, that's probably just like the screen resolution

479
00:29:10,035 --> 00:29:12,395
Speaker 5:  being off and it hurt your eyes. Like that's,

480
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:16,475
Speaker 4:  You're likes you haven't had emotional experiences with technology before.

481
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:17,915
Speaker 4:  That's impossible.

482
00:29:19,115 --> 00:29:22,875
Speaker 5:  I don don't know. I I'm not convinced that that

483
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:25,435
Speaker 5:  is the killer app. Not you

484
00:29:25,435 --> 00:29:28,475
Speaker 4:  Are just, you just never had a feeling in your life. Man, I cried when I

485
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:32,435
Speaker 4:  watched the movie Best of the Best with Julia Robert's brother. Like, I'm

486
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:35,675
Speaker 4:  confident this thing is gonna bring me to tears. Like the first time I try

487
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:39,115
Speaker 4:  it on, I've started shooting, I will say because you know, there has been

488
00:29:39,115 --> 00:29:42,725
Speaker 4:  these very controlled apple's been weird with the press.

489
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:46,445
Speaker 4:  I'm just gonna say this, right? They, they did the, the Apple Watch thing

490
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:49,405
Speaker 4:  and this weird background statement to one app. Like that's weird. It's just

491
00:29:49,405 --> 00:29:52,445
Speaker 4:  weird on its face. We're gonna talk about the CarPlay announcement.

492
00:29:52,915 --> 00:29:56,845
Speaker 4:  CarPlay also wasn't a press release. They gave that to GQ and

493
00:29:56,915 --> 00:30:00,765
Speaker 4:  cool. Like what are, what are we doing? And then this weird

494
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:04,045
Speaker 4:  thing where like some people get to do this facial video demo and some people

495
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:05,605
Speaker 4:  like whatever, even

496
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:09,005
Speaker 5:  The Beeper stuff to like call a win for us weird. Which it also was

497
00:30:09,585 --> 00:30:13,205
Speaker 5:  the Beeper stuff, which Apple never in a million years would've talked about.

498
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,045
Speaker 5:  We spent weeks trying to get them to talk. They gave me one quote and have

499
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:18,885
Speaker 5:  never answered another question about it. Yeah.

500
00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:22,245
Speaker 4:  What? Yeah, that's true. Like we're in the ecosystem. Yeah. So sometimes,

501
00:30:22,505 --> 00:30:25,445
Speaker 4:  you know, the light of the sun shines upon us. Yeah. It's weird. I'm just

502
00:30:25,445 --> 00:30:29,205
Speaker 4:  pointing out in general it's been, it's been a weird yeah, a weird

503
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:33,605
Speaker 4:  sequence of statements and not statements and, and whatever. But

504
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:37,565
Speaker 4:  the, the Vision Pro one is to me

505
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:41,845
Speaker 4:  is like classic Apple where they just

506
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:45,125
Speaker 4:  want people to be talking about other people's experiences, which are good,

507
00:30:46,055 --> 00:30:48,845
Speaker 4:  which is fine. You know, it's like again, people, companies are gonna, apple

508
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:52,365
Speaker 4:  has run the most successful playbook in this in world's history. Keep doing

509
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:55,405
Speaker 4:  it. But the idea that

510
00:30:56,495 --> 00:30:59,755
Speaker 4:  you're gonna put on this headset and have an immediate set of emotional experiences

511
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:03,515
Speaker 4:  is what Apple definitely wants you to think about it right now. Yes. Not

512
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:04,235
Speaker 4:  it's

513
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:07,395
Speaker 6:  What you should think about it. Having an emotional experience through a

514
00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:10,795
Speaker 6:  screen is the best thing possible. Yes. I mean what, think about it. What

515
00:31:10,795 --> 00:31:13,875
Speaker 6:  would you rather do? Use your real eyes to look at your children in three

516
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:17,955
Speaker 6:  dimensions or look at them inside an Apple headset on a screen

517
00:31:18,055 --> 00:31:18,875
Speaker 6:  in three dimensions.

518
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:20,235
Speaker 4:  Well, if they're not around, I

519
00:31:20,235 --> 00:31:21,155
Speaker 6:  Think there's an obvious answer here.

520
00:31:22,165 --> 00:31:23,325
Speaker 4:  I thi look as a, as

521
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:25,565
Speaker 6:  A parent. Well they actually, they are around, they're, they're tapping you

522
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:28,605
Speaker 6:  on the shoulder right now as you're wearing the headset looking at them.

523
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,525
Speaker 4:  I'm just saying as a parent on the five-year-old, there are definitely moments

524
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:34,845
Speaker 4:  where I'm like, I wish I could just rewind the clock on whatever you're doing

525
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:38,085
Speaker 4:  right now and experience you a couple weeks ago.

526
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:43,525
Speaker 6:  And you can with an Apple Vision Pro, it is only $3,500.

527
00:31:43,665 --> 00:31:45,285
Speaker 6:  How, how have you not bought one already?

528
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:47,765
Speaker 4:  It's beautiful. I started shooting, like I've started shooting some social

529
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:51,205
Speaker 4:  videos, just So I have them. Right? I'm like, I'm very curious about this.

530
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:55,645
Speaker 4:  My, my broader point is not positive or or negative.

531
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:59,525
Speaker 4:  It's just, you can see when I say what is the killer app

532
00:31:59,525 --> 00:32:03,405
Speaker 4:  for this, it is not something that is useful. It is something that is emotional.

533
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:06,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like that's what we're being steered towards. You're gonna have a series

534
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:10,005
Speaker 4:  of emotional experiences with this technology, which is probably the right

535
00:32:10,005 --> 00:32:13,405
Speaker 4:  thing. Richard sarcasm aside probably the right thing.

536
00:32:13,895 --> 00:32:16,525
Speaker 4:  Right? Here's the thing that's gonna help you relieve some memories. Here's

537
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:19,645
Speaker 4:  the thing that's gonna blow your mind. Here's the thing that's gonna be memorable

538
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:22,485
Speaker 4:  that you're gonna wanna talk about. That you're gonna be excited for buying

539
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:26,405
Speaker 4:  the more affordable version when it comes out. Not, here's a thing that

540
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:30,125
Speaker 4:  helps you get better at work. So you tell your boss to expense a

541
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:34,045
Speaker 4:  3,500 headset, which is where Meta was going with the Quest

542
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:37,935
Speaker 4:  Pro, right? and it just, no one could get there. Like no one was like,

543
00:32:37,935 --> 00:32:39,055
Speaker 4:  this has made me more productive.

544
00:32:39,475 --> 00:32:42,925
Speaker 5:  It's kind of what Apple learned from the watch, right? Like Apple

545
00:32:43,385 --> 00:32:47,045
Speaker 5:  framed the watch as very much a successor to the phone

546
00:32:47,305 --> 00:32:50,565
Speaker 5:  and that didn't work. But then Apple found out a thing the watch was good

547
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:53,925
Speaker 5:  at that the phone was not, which was all the health and wellness and fitness

548
00:32:53,975 --> 00:32:56,765
Speaker 5:  stuff and just leaned really hard into that. And so all of a sudden it's

549
00:32:56,765 --> 00:32:59,645
Speaker 5:  like, okay, you need this device because it does things your other devices

550
00:32:59,775 --> 00:33:03,725
Speaker 5:  can't do. And I think the problem all the headsets have

551
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:07,005
Speaker 5:  had so far is they don't really have any of that, right? They, they yell

552
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:10,205
Speaker 5:  about like it's more immersive and they, they talk about like the games you

553
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:12,845
Speaker 5:  can play, but fundamentally it's like stuff you can do on other screens.

554
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:16,805
Speaker 5:  Just different and potentially cooler.

555
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:21,485
Speaker 5:  And that Pitch doesn't actually work all that well. At least not at the scale.

556
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:25,325
Speaker 5:  You need to work if you're Apple, but with something like you're talking

557
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:29,285
Speaker 5:  about like 360 videos, feel like you're living inside

558
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:32,965
Speaker 5:  of your memories. Like there it is. That's a thing real or not. Like that

559
00:33:32,965 --> 00:33:36,845
Speaker 5:  is, that is a thing I can't do on my phone. Whereas like I have

560
00:33:36,845 --> 00:33:38,005
Speaker 5:  more screens. It's not, and

561
00:33:38,005 --> 00:33:40,805
Speaker 6:  In a world where most of the people don't have actual access to these devices,

562
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:44,005
Speaker 6:  it's a story that you can tell over and over and over again and they'll be

563
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:47,205
Speaker 6:  interested in until you can get the price down and the manufacturing up and

564
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:49,845
Speaker 6:  actually sell them in affordable headset. Yeah. Two and a half years from

565
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:49,925
Speaker 6:  now,

566
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:52,845
Speaker 4:  I'm just gonna remind everyone that many, many years ago

567
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,645
Speaker 4:  before disinformation and fake news was a threat to

568
00:33:57,645 --> 00:34:00,845
Speaker 4:  democracy, we ran a fake Super Bowl ad.

569
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:05,045
Speaker 4:  We put out a press release saying we were gonna run a Super Bowl ad. This

570
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:08,845
Speaker 4:  got picked up far and wide. We, we did it to punk the haters. I want to be

571
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:12,725
Speaker 4:  very clear, there was like three reporters that specifically I wanted

572
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:15,725
Speaker 4:  to tweak and we got 'em all. We also unfortunately got the New York Times,

573
00:34:17,215 --> 00:34:21,085
Speaker 4:  which to this day has a story in their set that says like The

574
00:34:21,205 --> 00:34:24,845
Speaker 4:  Verge planned Super Bowl ad No Box. Which is technically true. It was true.

575
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:28,645
Speaker 4:  We bought a Super Bowl ad, we bought airtime in Helena, Montana for

576
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:30,045
Speaker 4:  like $700

577
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:35,125
Speaker 4:  and we ran a, a very local Super Bowl ad. We sent a reporter to the Buffalo

578
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:39,165
Speaker 4:  Wild Wings to in Helen Montana to watch our Superbowl ad

579
00:34:39,165 --> 00:34:43,005
Speaker 4:  and see what people reacted. And I, I don't need to

580
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:46,725
Speaker 4:  tell you that the patrons of the Buffalo Wild Wings in Helena, Montana

581
00:34:46,725 --> 00:34:50,605
Speaker 4:  during the Super Bowl were not moved by our Super Bowl ad

582
00:34:51,345 --> 00:34:53,445
Speaker 4:  Our traffic did not go up on that day.

583
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:59,245
Speaker 4:  But in that ad there is a shot of former Verge editor Ross

584
00:34:59,245 --> 00:35:03,165
Speaker 4:  Miller shedding a tear inside a VR headset. Oh yeah. And that is the

585
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:06,765
Speaker 4:  thing that most people seized upon is being utterly

586
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:10,765
Speaker 4:  ludicrous inside. Like, the joke inside of our joke

587
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:14,795
Speaker 4:  was that The Verge thought people would cry in VR and like

588
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:17,595
Speaker 4:  now here we are, it's 2024 and Apple's like here's what you're gonna do.

589
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:20,595
Speaker 4:  You're gonna weep like a little baby in our headset. And it's like All right?

590
00:35:20,595 --> 00:35:21,475
Speaker 4:  We weren't so wrong.

591
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:26,095
Speaker 4:  I'm excited. Like I said, I've already started shooting some videos of, of

592
00:35:26,155 --> 00:35:30,085
Speaker 4:  Max in the, in in spatial video. Just 'cause I don't wanna look at

593
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:34,025
Speaker 4:  someone else's kids. That's not gonna make me cry. I'm not gonna

594
00:35:34,025 --> 00:35:35,345
Speaker 4:  look at David's kid. Yeah.

595
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:36,505
Speaker 5:  Whatever he sucks.

596
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:39,565
Speaker 4:  We should actually that's, that's okay. This is gonna be part of the review.

597
00:35:40,095 --> 00:35:43,645
Speaker 4:  We're gonna send each other videos of our children. Ooh, love and see I love

598
00:35:43,645 --> 00:35:47,525
Speaker 4:  that. If one of other's children can make us cry, okay, that's cool.

599
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:51,565
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna cry like a baby no matter what happens. I love kids All. right.

600
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:55,415
Speaker 4:  Last one. Richard. I feel like you gotta you gotta take us to the

601
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:57,535
Speaker 4:  CarPlay situation 'cause it is ridiculous.

602
00:35:58,005 --> 00:36:01,815
Speaker 6:  Last year in 2022, if you can remember at its developer conference,

603
00:36:01,815 --> 00:36:05,015
Speaker 6:  apple said that we were gonna get a new Next gen CarPlay would take over

604
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:08,135
Speaker 6:  every screen in your car and they were going to announce vehicle news by

605
00:36:08,135 --> 00:36:12,015
Speaker 6:  the end of 2023. It is. We've got a few days left in 2023

606
00:36:12,015 --> 00:36:15,735
Speaker 6:  and they finally said it's coming in some Porsche in

607
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:19,695
Speaker 6:  Aston Martin next year maybe. And we've got two mock up

608
00:36:19,695 --> 00:36:23,535
Speaker 6:  displays Yeah. Of the kind of CarPlay equipped supercars.

609
00:36:24,075 --> 00:36:27,975
Speaker 6:  And what you see is the CarPlay screen across, even, even

610
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:31,055
Speaker 6:  in the, the dashboard right in front of the driver with the, the speedometer,

611
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:34,935
Speaker 6:  the tachometer, whatever you want, it's in the center or maybe it's on the

612
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:38,815
Speaker 6:  left. It's styled with their logos, with their colors and with their, I think

613
00:36:38,815 --> 00:36:42,615
Speaker 6:  Porsche's hound tos hounds tos pattern that they usually have on their seats

614
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:46,865
Speaker 6:  is now in the screen. I'm not sure if it's any better than

615
00:36:46,935 --> 00:36:50,225
Speaker 6:  what you already have in your car or something you actually aspire to. But

616
00:36:50,225 --> 00:36:53,785
Speaker 6:  the idea is that if you are a Porsche owner and you're using

617
00:36:53,785 --> 00:36:56,785
Speaker 6:  CarPlay, you'll get a special CarPlay experience that someone doesn't get

618
00:36:56,785 --> 00:37:00,545
Speaker 6:  in, you know, their their mirror Honda or or a, or a Toyota or something

619
00:37:00,545 --> 00:37:03,945
Speaker 6:  like that. So, so you don't have to deal with that anymore. I'm,

620
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:08,385
Speaker 6:  I'm not sure really where we're going with this. I I just buttons are still

621
00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:12,305
Speaker 6:  better. We, we had dials and needles and that was fine to show

622
00:37:12,305 --> 00:37:13,745
Speaker 6:  out your speed in your tachometer.

623
00:37:13,925 --> 00:37:17,785
Speaker 4:  So a couple things. One, a totally reasonable headline on the

624
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:21,585
Speaker 4:  story could have been Apple announces Photoshops. Yes. Because

625
00:37:21,585 --> 00:37:24,505
Speaker 4:  these things are not real. They're, I believe they're real. They they are.

626
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:28,495
Speaker 4:  What? These pictures are not real. So the, the

627
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:32,535
Speaker 4:  Aston Martin one in particular is the interior of an Aston Martin DB 12.

628
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:37,095
Speaker 4:  and it is just a bad Photoshop job. Like the,

629
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:41,865
Speaker 4:  the CarPlay display has not been skewed correctly onto the screen of

630
00:37:41,865 --> 00:37:45,735
Speaker 4:  the Aston Martin DB 12. And I know this because it broke my

631
00:37:45,735 --> 00:37:49,575
Speaker 4:  brain and I put it on threads and people started noticing that the

632
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:53,175
Speaker 4:  lines aren't parallel. Oh geez. Like it's just, it's just

633
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:57,205
Speaker 4:  weird. So that's one thing the Porsche is a little more

634
00:37:57,205 --> 00:38:00,565
Speaker 4:  confusing. I'm not a hundred percent. I assumed it was a can. It doesn't

635
00:38:00,565 --> 00:38:04,485
Speaker 4:  look like Cayenne. If, even if you just look at that. So what

636
00:38:04,485 --> 00:38:08,325
Speaker 4:  you have in the Aston Martin is they took over the infotainment with

637
00:38:08,435 --> 00:38:12,275
Speaker 4:  just regular old CarPlay unclear

638
00:38:13,055 --> 00:38:16,715
Speaker 4:  why they had to Photoshop this badly. That's just CarPlay

639
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:18,035
Speaker 4:  on that center screen.

640
00:38:18,105 --> 00:38:20,435
Speaker 6:  It's not what they showed last, it's not what they showed in 2022.

641
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:22,515
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I'm just saying like that's just, it's just CarPlay on the center screen

642
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:26,555
Speaker 4:  and the CarPlay has a handful of climate

643
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:29,875
Speaker 4:  controls baked into it. What's particularly funny about that is there are

644
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:33,835
Speaker 4:  hard buttons in the DB 12 for climate, like right below them. So

645
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:36,565
Speaker 4:  we've accomplished a lot, but you've got a little bit of climate control

646
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:40,005
Speaker 4:  and CarPlay that's a big, and then you've obviously got the speedometer and

647
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:43,895
Speaker 4:  the, but CarPlay today can access the

648
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:47,815
Speaker 4:  center screens of certain cars like pole stars. So we just very little

649
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:50,855
Speaker 4:  has been accomplished in the Aston Martin screenshot,

650
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:53,225
Speaker 4:  the poor screenshot.

651
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:58,895
Speaker 4:  Again, it appears to just be Photoshop. You look at it and you're like,

652
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:03,475
Speaker 4:  why would you want this? Like why

653
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:06,915
Speaker 4:  first of all, the Porsche is going 205 kilometers an hour,

654
00:39:08,635 --> 00:39:11,625
Speaker 4:  which is 127 miles per hour sick.

655
00:39:12,445 --> 00:39:13,985
Speaker 4:  Why? On a phone call

656
00:39:15,815 --> 00:39:19,065
Speaker 4:  With a calendar open on the passenger display.

657
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:23,625
Speaker 4:  So it's like this is the most dangerous office environment in world history.

658
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:28,585
Speaker 4:  Like don't do this. I think did you misunderstand Porsche customers?

659
00:39:31,175 --> 00:39:34,265
Speaker 4:  Like that's it. And then all of this screen real estate

660
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:39,025
Speaker 4:  is again to, to my eye just like not

661
00:39:39,025 --> 00:39:42,925
Speaker 4:  being used for anything. Right. So you've got a gauge cluster,

662
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:46,725
Speaker 4:  you've got a speedometer, you've got a row of icons. So you've got

663
00:39:46,805 --> 00:39:50,595
Speaker 4:  a launcher, you have a giant map

664
00:39:50,595 --> 00:39:54,035
Speaker 4:  instruction that says stay on this road. You have call controls

665
00:39:54,455 --> 00:39:57,715
Speaker 4:  and then over on the right, that massive passenger display,

666
00:39:58,455 --> 00:40:00,155
Speaker 4:  you've got two calendar entries,

667
00:40:02,285 --> 00:40:06,085
Speaker 4:  a media controller, which w why is that all the way over there?

668
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,505
Speaker 4:  And then more map information and then the weather.

669
00:40:12,215 --> 00:40:13,945
Speaker 5:  Perfect. I didn't see the problem in here.

670
00:40:14,415 --> 00:40:18,265
Speaker 4:  It's like they're rallying. What is all this obviously like is this, are

671
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:22,145
Speaker 4:  people crying out for the lowest information density

672
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:26,345
Speaker 4:  possible in the driving while you're going 130 miles an hour?

673
00:40:26,985 --> 00:40:30,185
Speaker 5:  I I, I'm so torn on this because on the one hand

674
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:35,225
Speaker 5:  I think it continues to be true that CarPlay is better

675
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:39,105
Speaker 5:  than everybody else's software in cars. Yes. So,

676
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:40,265
Speaker 5:  so to some extent,

677
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:42,945
Speaker 4:  And by the way and you know, I don't think it's good. Oh but I will agree

678
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:45,625
Speaker 4:  with you. You it's, yeah, I didn't say it was good. Say for Tesla and potentially

679
00:40:45,765 --> 00:40:46,185
Speaker 4:  rivian

680
00:40:48,415 --> 00:40:50,225
Speaker 5:  Sure, fine. Maybe

681
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:55,785
Speaker 5:  it's, it's better than Porsche would build on its own is a thing I believe

682
00:40:55,855 --> 00:40:58,505
Speaker 5:  very strongly that said,

683
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:02,915
Speaker 5:  why do we want any of this? Like the my favorite thing that happened here

684
00:41:02,935 --> 00:41:06,875
Speaker 5:  was this came out like right at the same time that VW did an interview where

685
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:10,795
Speaker 5:  it was like, we're bringing buttons back to our cars because everybody wants

686
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:14,755
Speaker 5:  buttons and we tried to do other things and we moved everything around

687
00:41:15,155 --> 00:41:18,355
Speaker 5:  and people said, stop it. Give us buttons. Yeah. So they were bringing back

688
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:22,155
Speaker 5:  buttons. That's like a thing that happened. And so I'm like, okay, if this

689
00:41:22,155 --> 00:41:25,875
Speaker 5:  is where cars are headed, I kind of don't think it's the worst idea

690
00:41:26,055 --> 00:41:30,025
Speaker 5:  to give all of it to companies that actually know how to

691
00:41:30,025 --> 00:41:33,765
Speaker 5:  build software. I'm not sure the right answer is Apple, but it's like if,

692
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:37,565
Speaker 5:  if, if all of my car is going to be is a bunch of screens, I would rather

693
00:41:37,675 --> 00:41:41,525
Speaker 5:  have Apple program those screens than whoever makes

694
00:41:41,525 --> 00:41:45,285
Speaker 5:  my car. Just as I would rather have a car company make my car than Apple.

695
00:41:46,585 --> 00:41:50,445
Speaker 5:  But I What if we just didn't do any of this? Like what if we

696
00:41:50,445 --> 00:41:54,405
Speaker 5:  just rewound this idea back like six generations ago

697
00:41:54,785 --> 00:41:57,885
Speaker 5:  and just made cars the better way.

698
00:41:59,095 --> 00:42:02,985
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And we, we did our best to, to put software

699
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:04,465
Speaker 4:  in them that made sense or

700
00:42:04,465 --> 00:42:08,425
Speaker 5:  Just less software. Like I, I'm I'm almost on

701
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:12,225
Speaker 5:  the neli team of like the amount of software I need in my car is a

702
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:13,065
Speaker 5:  mount for my phone.

703
00:42:14,595 --> 00:42:15,425
Speaker 5:  Maybe that's it.

704
00:42:15,735 --> 00:42:18,705
Speaker 6:  Like, like when we were at the part where it was just Bluetooth controlling

705
00:42:18,725 --> 00:42:21,225
Speaker 6:  the app on your phone that's playing the podcast and you could just press

706
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:25,145
Speaker 6:  the same play button and pause button to pause it or whatever. We were pretty

707
00:42:25,145 --> 00:42:26,905
Speaker 6:  good there. Like that's that's what you want. Mostly

708
00:42:27,385 --> 00:42:28,185
Speaker 4:  I am utterly

709
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:29,905
Speaker 6:  And your phone on a mountain with Google Map. Yeah.

710
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:33,305
Speaker 4:  Befuddled. So again, I think the Aston Martin screenshot is a DB 12.

711
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,625
Speaker 4:  I'm almost a hundred percent sure

712
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,665
Speaker 6:  Of that. It has to be. It was only car announced.

713
00:42:38,655 --> 00:42:41,025
Speaker 4:  Well no they didn't announce any cars. This is an important part of this

714
00:42:41,145 --> 00:42:44,265
Speaker 4:  announcement. They didn't announce any actual cars, they didn't announce

715
00:42:44,285 --> 00:42:47,545
Speaker 4:  any actual features. They announced two screenshots

716
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:52,645
Speaker 4:  which are Photoshops. Yep. And two quotes from people who work at Aston

717
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:55,285
Speaker 4:  Mar Martin and Porsche So I couldn't tell you

718
00:42:55,315 --> 00:42:57,725
Speaker 6:  When these Well they, they told Car and Driver that it should be in the,

719
00:42:57,785 --> 00:43:00,605
Speaker 6:  the system that's coming next year in the DB 12 in the Volante. Oh,

720
00:43:00,635 --> 00:43:02,125
Speaker 4:  Okay. So Aston Martin or Car and Driver has

721
00:43:02,265 --> 00:43:05,925
Speaker 6:  And Porsche said something they'll like have more information when they reveal

722
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:09,285
Speaker 6:  the, the mocking or however you say that the all electric car that

723
00:43:09,285 --> 00:43:11,525
Speaker 4:  They approach. Okay, so this is the interior of the Macon that

724
00:43:11,525 --> 00:43:13,085
Speaker 6:  That's what, that's what you can assume I think

725
00:43:13,085 --> 00:43:16,685
Speaker 4:  Because it's not the current interior of the current Macon. Yes. So

726
00:43:17,045 --> 00:43:20,325
Speaker 4:  a new electric Macon will have this. Okay, fine. That makes sense to me.

727
00:43:20,705 --> 00:43:24,315
Speaker 4:  I'm just saying why like Apple could have just been late.

728
00:43:24,985 --> 00:43:27,855
Speaker 4:  Right? They promised it by the end of this year they would have some announcements

729
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:31,775
Speaker 4:  we had heard, I've heard over and over and over again from all kinds of car

730
00:43:32,015 --> 00:43:35,735
Speaker 4:  companies except for Porsche, Eston, Martin. Which foolishly I did not think

731
00:43:35,735 --> 00:43:39,695
Speaker 4:  to consider that no one's gonna do this because everyone thinks the future

732
00:43:39,795 --> 00:43:43,695
Speaker 4:  of their cars is recurring revenue in the cars. You can go listen to

733
00:43:43,815 --> 00:43:47,775
Speaker 4:  the CEO Volvo on decoder just recently talk about how he's doing it

734
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:51,215
Speaker 4:  differently. But he still wants to do recurring revenue just for like car

735
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:54,295
Speaker 4:  insurance. Like everyone thinks that controlling this interface is a big

736
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:57,895
Speaker 4:  deal. Yeah. And letting Apple undifferentiated their cars is a big deal.

737
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:02,295
Speaker 4:  So you can see this middle step is Apple is still gonna run all the software

738
00:44:03,405 --> 00:44:07,345
Speaker 4:  but Porsche gets to skin it or Aston. Martin gets to skin it a

739
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:07,705
Speaker 4:  little bit.

740
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:12,575
Speaker 4:  Okay. But they're not actually cars. Like why not wait until you have an

741
00:44:12,575 --> 00:44:15,735
Speaker 4:  actual car? What was the rush? Yeah. To get it out before the end of the

742
00:44:15,735 --> 00:44:17,455
Speaker 4:  year. Like no one thought it was coming.

743
00:44:17,605 --> 00:44:20,975
Speaker 6:  They could've done like a line on the page where they talk about the next

744
00:44:21,035 --> 00:44:24,935
Speaker 6:  gen CarPlay that says oh and it's coming in of Porsche in

745
00:44:24,935 --> 00:44:26,175
Speaker 6:  Aston Martin next year. Right.

746
00:44:26,175 --> 00:44:28,615
Speaker 4:  But we instead we have to announce some, some screenshots.

747
00:44:28,755 --> 00:44:32,525
Speaker 5:  Do you think Apple I don know man like some lawyer at Apple came like running

748
00:44:32,555 --> 00:44:35,965
Speaker 5:  into Tim Cook's office and was like, the watch is getting banned And Tim

749
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:37,565
Speaker 5:  was just like, release the Photoshops

750
00:44:39,755 --> 00:44:43,605
Speaker 5:  just has them ready. He's like, whenever we need to drown out bad

751
00:44:43,605 --> 00:44:45,845
Speaker 5:  news, we'll just show people weird CarPlay stuff.

752
00:44:46,145 --> 00:44:50,005
Speaker 4:  I'm excited, I'm excited for us to have giant screens full

753
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:52,765
Speaker 4:  of redundant information surrounding us in cars. You know what's great about

754
00:44:52,765 --> 00:44:56,085
Speaker 4:  driving at night is having bright LED lit screens at you

755
00:44:56,515 --> 00:45:00,085
Speaker 4:  just in the middle of nowhere. Yeah. All right? That's the end of the apple

756
00:45:00,085 --> 00:45:02,485
Speaker 4:  chaos. We gotta, we gotta wrap this up. We're gonna come back. We're doing

757
00:45:02,485 --> 00:45:06,325
Speaker 4:  a very fast lighting round then we're gonna do a year in review. It's gonna

758
00:45:06,325 --> 00:45:07,565
Speaker 4:  be great. We'll be right back.

759
00:47:06,885 --> 00:47:09,445
Speaker 4:  right? We're back. We have to do a very fast lightning round

760
00:47:10,615 --> 00:47:14,585
Speaker 4:  fast. The note is for me, I'm the one who makes the struggle. All, right?

761
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:15,825
Speaker 4:  David, kick us off

762
00:47:15,965 --> 00:47:17,505
Speaker 5:  For this lightning round. I have six things.

763
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:22,945
Speaker 5:  No mine's very short. It's that Bird, the Once

764
00:47:23,805 --> 00:47:25,105
Speaker 5:  Flying Scooter company

765
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:30,845
Speaker 5:  is cooked and at to steal from. Jess

766
00:47:30,845 --> 00:47:34,685
Speaker 5:  Weathered on our team. Bird filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy.

767
00:47:34,745 --> 00:47:38,725
Speaker 5:  The company has been like all but dead for a pretty long time and

768
00:47:38,995 --> 00:47:42,835
Speaker 5:  just seems to have completely given up. This company was worth, I wanna

769
00:47:42,835 --> 00:47:46,395
Speaker 5:  say like two or $3 billion just a few years ago. I

770
00:47:47,105 --> 00:47:51,035
Speaker 5:  confess I was all in on this like micro mobility future. I

771
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:54,795
Speaker 5:  still kind of think it could work that like what we need is better public

772
00:47:54,795 --> 00:47:58,435
Speaker 5:  transit. But what we also need is cool ways to get around cities that

773
00:47:58,435 --> 00:48:02,275
Speaker 5:  aren't cars. And like I'm, I think the e-bike revolution is really interesting.

774
00:48:02,275 --> 00:48:05,995
Speaker 5:  I think scooters really interesting. All this stuff. Bird like

775
00:48:06,075 --> 00:48:09,715
Speaker 5:  really started this trend in a really big way. It just sort of dropped

776
00:48:09,795 --> 00:48:13,715
Speaker 5:  scooters in every city in the world. Made a ton of money. Raised a

777
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:17,315
Speaker 5:  ton of money, really did the Uber Playbook. It was run by Travis Vander Zaden,

778
00:48:17,315 --> 00:48:21,195
Speaker 5:  who was a former Uber executive. Took over in a huge way. Flew

779
00:48:21,195 --> 00:48:22,315
Speaker 5:  too close to the sun. And

780
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:25,235
Speaker 5:  RIP Bird. That's

781
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,475
Speaker 4:  That. I was just in downtown LA by the way. I went to the Emmy Awards 'cause

782
00:48:28,475 --> 00:48:30,875
Speaker 4:  our Netflix show was nominated for an Emmy. Yeah, that's like a real

783
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,235
Speaker 5:  Thing. Disclosure. We make a Netflix show.

784
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:35,075
Speaker 4:  We, well, we we're gonna talk about Warner Bros show. It's coming anyway.

785
00:48:35,095 --> 00:48:39,075
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. Disclosure, our Netflix show was nominated for an Emmy and I went

786
00:48:39,075 --> 00:48:42,875
Speaker 4:  to Emmy awards, which was crazy. And I sat behind

787
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:46,355
Speaker 4:  the production team for the Kelly Clarkson show it.

788
00:48:46,665 --> 00:48:50,595
Speaker 4:  They loved to party, they were just whooping it up. And

789
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:54,115
Speaker 4:  statues for days over at the Kelly Clarkson Show, sadly we did not win. We

790
00:48:54,115 --> 00:48:57,805
Speaker 4:  lost a show about Italy on PBS, which, you know, when you're in the

791
00:48:57,805 --> 00:49:01,645
Speaker 4:  educational informational program category, the daytime mes, you

792
00:49:01,645 --> 00:49:05,365
Speaker 4:  kind of think you're gonna lose to the show about Italian food. Yeah. So

793
00:49:05,365 --> 00:49:07,645
Speaker 4:  it was still fun to go. It's still fun. Hang with their team. But anyway,

794
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:11,405
Speaker 4:  So I was at the Emmys downtown la The streets are full of scooters.

795
00:49:12,105 --> 00:49:15,885
Speaker 4:  And what struck me was everyone, if you'll remember Bird and Lime,

796
00:49:16,435 --> 00:49:20,285
Speaker 4:  they started with just like consumer scooters. They were like ordering

797
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:23,925
Speaker 4:  from like Ollie Express. Yeah. At massive costs. And they were breaking and

798
00:49:23,925 --> 00:49:26,325
Speaker 4:  people like throwing in the river and they were like, we're gonna engineer

799
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:29,325
Speaker 4:  the scooter seat better once they've taken off. And they've done that. And

800
00:49:29,325 --> 00:49:33,005
Speaker 4:  the Bird scooters in particular now look like some Mad Max

801
00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:36,645
Speaker 4:  shit. Oh yeah. Like raw, raw aluminum. Like

802
00:49:37,035 --> 00:49:40,805
Speaker 4:  totally armored. Like they're, it's like an imposing thing

803
00:49:41,385 --> 00:49:43,725
Speaker 4:  and it's like, oh these are the least cute scooters now.

804
00:49:43,955 --> 00:49:47,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They weigh like a thousand pounds too. Yeah. And this is the problem.

805
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:51,325
Speaker 5:  All those things became totally commoditized and everybody was like either,

806
00:49:51,545 --> 00:49:53,765
Speaker 5:  you know, we're gonna win and then we're gonna be able to raise prices like

807
00:49:53,765 --> 00:49:56,725
Speaker 5:  Uber did, or we're gonna figure out how to make the unit economics work so

808
00:49:56,725 --> 00:50:00,485
Speaker 5:  that they stick around all this stuff. And then some combination of

809
00:50:00,485 --> 00:50:03,525
Speaker 5:  everybody grew too fast and there was a global pandemic and nobody went outside

810
00:50:03,525 --> 00:50:07,365
Speaker 5:  for a year. Yeah. Just crushed everybody. And like kudos to

811
00:50:07,475 --> 00:50:11,245
Speaker 5:  Lime and a couple of others that have kind of managed to stick it out and

812
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:15,405
Speaker 5:  continue to, to keep on keeping on. But this was,

813
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:19,445
Speaker 5:  this was always coming for Bird. It was either going to, it really was,

814
00:50:19,445 --> 00:50:23,365
Speaker 5:  it was either going to just completely decimate everybody and take

815
00:50:23,365 --> 00:50:27,310
Speaker 5:  over the world, or it was going to run through all of its money really fast

816
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,165
Speaker 5:  and die. And that seems to be what happened.

817
00:50:29,435 --> 00:50:31,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So it, it was less Uber and more WeWork.

818
00:50:32,525 --> 00:50:33,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah, exactly.

819
00:50:33,945 --> 00:50:37,725
Speaker 4:  All SoftBank vision fund investments. I, yeah. All. right. Speaking of

820
00:50:38,045 --> 00:50:41,325
Speaker 4:  things that are doomed Richard, I believe you have a lightning round item

821
00:50:41,325 --> 00:50:42,045
Speaker 4:  for us. Yes.

822
00:50:42,505 --> 00:50:46,445
Speaker 6:  The news broke through multiple outlets in the,

823
00:50:46,445 --> 00:50:49,405
Speaker 6:  in the last day or so that Warner, Bros, Discovery and Paramount executives

824
00:50:49,405 --> 00:50:53,245
Speaker 6:  are in discussions for a Max merger. That was an Alex K's headline of course.

825
00:50:53,505 --> 00:50:54,085
Speaker 4:  Oh my God.

826
00:50:54,115 --> 00:50:58,085
Speaker 6:  Because we might get Paramount plus Max Max

827
00:50:58,085 --> 00:51:01,725
Speaker 6:  Plus or something like that. I hated so much if these companies are allowed

828
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:05,325
Speaker 6:  to combine, because we have two failing giant

829
00:51:05,325 --> 00:51:08,165
Speaker 6:  entertainment companies that can't really support themselves under their

830
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,445
Speaker 6:  own weight. The only solution that their executives can think of

831
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:13,605
Speaker 6:  is to combine them. Yeah.

832
00:51:13,975 --> 00:51:14,325
Speaker 4:  Which,

833
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,485
Speaker 6:  I don't know what else you could do, but they're probably going to try and

834
00:51:18,485 --> 00:51:20,525
Speaker 6:  find out if this, if this is the solution, you

835
00:51:20,525 --> 00:51:21,565
Speaker 4:  Could try to make good movies.

836
00:51:23,225 --> 00:51:27,205
Speaker 4:  One option that is, does not seem to be in vogue,

837
00:51:28,465 --> 00:51:32,005
Speaker 4:  but it's just a, it's just a thing you could do. You could make a compelling

838
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:35,285
Speaker 4:  television show for your service that you've rebranded as Max.

839
00:51:35,505 --> 00:51:38,655
Speaker 5:  You could stop trying to be Netflix. Yeah. That could be fun.

840
00:51:39,685 --> 00:51:42,175
Speaker 5:  Like, I mean, this is the thing, right? And, and we've been talking about

841
00:51:42,175 --> 00:51:45,855
Speaker 5:  this for years now, that it was always

842
00:51:46,065 --> 00:51:50,055
Speaker 5:  going to be so expensive and so complicated to compete

843
00:51:50,085 --> 00:51:53,255
Speaker 5:  that there were always only going to be a few winners. And I think at this

844
00:51:53,255 --> 00:51:57,195
Speaker 5:  point, Netflix is one of those winners. Like

845
00:51:57,195 --> 00:52:01,155
Speaker 5:  I, I think I don, I don't see how Netflix falls apart at any point in the

846
00:52:01,345 --> 00:52:05,115
Speaker 5:  near future. Disney's one of those winners, but it is in kind of a weird

847
00:52:05,115 --> 00:52:08,955
Speaker 5:  place. And there's probably not room for many more like Apple TV and Prime

848
00:52:08,955 --> 00:52:11,675
Speaker 5:  Video get to live on because their companies have so much money that those

849
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:13,915
Speaker 5:  things are like not material. So

850
00:52:13,915 --> 00:52:17,115
Speaker 4:  This is the real problem though. But all these executives will tell you is

851
00:52:17,115 --> 00:52:21,075
Speaker 4:  that their competing against cost centers for tech companies,

852
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:24,755
Speaker 4:  right. That have massive profits. So Apple TV Plus is just a cost

853
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:28,155
Speaker 5:  Center. Yeah. It's like lunch for employees and Apple TV plus, and

854
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:31,915
Speaker 4:  Again, you know, my theory with Apple TV plus in particular is they make

855
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,315
Speaker 4:  it so that when they talk about services revenue, they don't have to talk

856
00:52:34,315 --> 00:52:37,075
Speaker 4:  about Candy Crush Whales because all their service rep service's revenue

857
00:52:37,735 --> 00:52:41,475
Speaker 4:  is the 30% cut of internet purchases on games. That is Apple Services

858
00:52:41,475 --> 00:52:45,355
Speaker 4:  revenue. Amazon does Prime and they spend a ton

859
00:52:45,355 --> 00:52:49,075
Speaker 4:  of money and you know, what you might describe as a

860
00:52:49,395 --> 00:52:53,355
Speaker 4:  produced Thursday night football game. It's not the best produced, but it's

861
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:57,275
Speaker 4:  produced Thursday night football game because stuff keeps prime subscribers

862
00:52:57,275 --> 00:53:01,235
Speaker 4:  around it. It it is their retention, they know it, but it's still a

863
00:53:01,235 --> 00:53:04,755
Speaker 4:  cost center, right? Like the lifetime value. They, and it's Amazon, they,

864
00:53:04,755 --> 00:53:07,715
Speaker 4:  they run the math, they like the lifetime value of Prime subscriber stays

865
00:53:07,715 --> 00:53:10,155
Speaker 4:  on year after year is very high. And we can take some of that margin out

866
00:53:10,155 --> 00:53:13,475
Speaker 4:  and produces TV show because that will inspire more people to stay for longer.

867
00:53:13,595 --> 00:53:16,595
Speaker 5:  I mean, they did a Black Friday football game. Like, I don't know if you

868
00:53:16,595 --> 00:53:19,595
Speaker 5:  need a clearer indication of where the money here is for Amazon,

869
00:53:19,885 --> 00:53:23,755
Speaker 4:  Right? If you're Warner Brothers, you don't have some other thing that's

870
00:53:23,755 --> 00:53:27,045
Speaker 4:  making all the money. You just have to like go make the thing. And

871
00:53:27,725 --> 00:53:31,325
Speaker 4:  I would just remind the audience that Warner Brothers

872
00:53:31,505 --> 00:53:35,485
Speaker 4:  is the most cursed company in world history

873
00:53:35,635 --> 00:53:37,125
Speaker 4:  when it comes to mergers. Like,

874
00:53:37,385 --> 00:53:38,245
Speaker 5:  God, that might be true.

875
00:53:39,105 --> 00:53:42,125
Speaker 4:  The times I, you know, don don't, I'm not this sort of person like runs around

876
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:44,645
Speaker 4:  like New York Times. But the Times had a very funny piece on this, or at

877
00:53:44,645 --> 00:53:47,365
Speaker 4:  least I thought it was funny 'cause they had the, you know, the very sort

878
00:53:47,365 --> 00:53:51,125
Speaker 4:  of normal times business writing of like, there's ample business logic

879
00:53:51,185 --> 00:53:54,125
Speaker 4:  for the deal. And then they like listed all the reasons you might wanna merge.

880
00:53:54,505 --> 00:53:58,465
Speaker 4:  And it's like, you know, every time any company merges a Warner Bros,

881
00:53:58,465 --> 00:54:02,305
Speaker 4:  it ends in disaster. Like, like the a

882
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:06,185
Speaker 4:  OL Time Warner merger is the most failed merger in history.

883
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:11,145
Speaker 4:  The at and t time Warner merger is a close second. Like

884
00:54:11,145 --> 00:54:14,945
Speaker 4:  the only thing that merger accomplished was a massive layoffs. A shitload

885
00:54:14,945 --> 00:54:17,985
Speaker 4:  of debt and a gray scale. Four three Snyder. Cut.

886
00:54:19,045 --> 00:54:22,025
Speaker 4:  That's it. That's what you got out of that merger. It's big three. Nothing

887
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,425
Speaker 4:  else. Like, what are we doing y'all? Oh, the Warner

888
00:54:25,425 --> 00:54:27,465
Speaker 6:  Bros Discovery Marjo hasn't failed yet.

889
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:31,905
Speaker 5:  I don't know. I think how How's your,

890
00:54:32,515 --> 00:54:36,145
Speaker 5:  how's your bat girl going? No, I think, I mean the, the problem is the Warner

891
00:54:36,145 --> 00:54:39,705
Speaker 5:  brothers Discovery thing was never gonna work. It has so much debt, so

892
00:54:39,705 --> 00:54:40,105
Speaker 4:  Much debt

893
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:43,625
Speaker 5:  And so many holes to dig out of that. It's like

894
00:54:43,915 --> 00:54:47,345
Speaker 5:  since the minute this company existed, people have been asking who are they

895
00:54:47,345 --> 00:54:51,025
Speaker 5:  gonna merge with, which was just, it was just never gonna

896
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:54,985
Speaker 5:  work. And the answer I think, I mean people have seen this coming for a long

897
00:54:54,985 --> 00:54:58,585
Speaker 5:  time, right? Like these are two companies that were never going to compete

898
00:54:59,135 --> 00:55:02,145
Speaker 5:  with the handful of giants that are out there, but combined

899
00:55:03,755 --> 00:55:04,105
Speaker 5:  maybe

900
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:06,225
Speaker 4:  Combined but combined to do what?

901
00:55:06,295 --> 00:55:06,945
Speaker 5:  Yeah, exactly

902
00:55:07,435 --> 00:55:11,425
Speaker 4:  Right. Like honestly combined to do what? To have more content. It's

903
00:55:11,425 --> 00:55:14,825
Speaker 4:  not more content that people, no one's running around being like, don don't

904
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:18,385
Speaker 4:  have enough content. Right? Right. And don don't even like that word. Like,

905
00:55:18,385 --> 00:55:22,265
Speaker 4:  it just implies like being shoveled gurg into your mouth. Just like take

906
00:55:22,325 --> 00:55:25,905
Speaker 4:  the content. Like just do it. It's another Tom Cruise movie. You will have

907
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:29,305
Speaker 4:  it. There's more reality television.

908
00:55:30,225 --> 00:55:33,665
Speaker 4:  I think what people are, what what you are looking to Hollywood to do

909
00:55:34,245 --> 00:55:37,625
Speaker 4:  is make really good stuff that is a little bit more scarce.

910
00:55:38,415 --> 00:55:42,185
Speaker 4:  Like if you want stuff with YouTube production values, boy is there a

911
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:46,145
Speaker 4:  YouTube for you? You know, if you want stuff at Hollywood production values,

912
00:55:46,145 --> 00:55:50,025
Speaker 4:  there's actually not, not a lot. and it, it just seems like there's a

913
00:55:50,025 --> 00:55:53,945
Speaker 4:  race to the bottom here because of all of the debt that in particular Warner

914
00:55:53,945 --> 00:55:57,625
Speaker 4:  has had to take on through its sequence of disastrous

915
00:55:57,655 --> 00:56:01,625
Speaker 4:  mergers. Like I don't, don don't know. Like these companies are not gonna

916
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:04,665
Speaker 4:  make a great app with a great user experience that makes you feel good about

917
00:56:04,665 --> 00:56:07,705
Speaker 4:  using it. That's full of really great stuff that inspires you to pick it

918
00:56:07,705 --> 00:56:10,855
Speaker 4:  over TikTok and like that's what they're really competing against is

919
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:12,335
Speaker 4:  TikTok on your phone.

920
00:56:12,595 --> 00:56:15,375
Speaker 6:  And I think that's the biggest problem for them is that when you look at

921
00:56:15,435 --> 00:56:19,335
Speaker 6:  the supposed winners in this space, Netflix, are they, are they

922
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:21,575
Speaker 6:  winning because they're probably going to have to raise their prices again.

923
00:56:21,575 --> 00:56:25,125
Speaker 6:  They do every six months or so. So anyway, they're throwing on games. They're

924
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:28,445
Speaker 6:  trying to find some other way to get you to pay more for a slightly bigger

925
00:56:28,445 --> 00:56:32,365
Speaker 6:  bundle until they actually do recreate cable Disney. What is

926
00:56:32,365 --> 00:56:35,365
Speaker 6:  Disney anymore? Is it going to have ES, espn, is it going to be something

927
00:56:35,365 --> 00:56:38,645
Speaker 6:  else? We don't even know. So I'm not even sure what the model for victory

928
00:56:38,745 --> 00:56:41,685
Speaker 6:  is for them. They, they just, they're chasing kind of nothing.

929
00:56:42,075 --> 00:56:45,085
Speaker 4:  It's mergers and golden parachutes. Let's be very honest. By the way, I have

930
00:56:45,085 --> 00:56:49,075
Speaker 4:  not done the full disclosure. Comcast is a minority investor.

931
00:56:49,175 --> 00:56:52,995
Speaker 4:  No Comcast by the way. I haven't done the full disclosure. Comcast NBC

932
00:56:52,995 --> 00:56:56,115
Speaker 4:  Universal Division is a minority investor in Fox Media, The, Verge parent

933
00:56:56,115 --> 00:56:59,475
Speaker 4:  company. I promise you not a lot of love from Comcast

934
00:56:59,985 --> 00:57:01,315
Speaker 4:  flowing in our direction.

935
00:57:03,695 --> 00:57:06,835
Speaker 4:  By the way, one of the, the other line was like this would in the Times cease,

936
00:57:06,975 --> 00:57:09,795
Speaker 4:  one of the other lines in the Times cease was this will give them leverage

937
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:13,475
Speaker 4:  in the, is they negotiate cable rates with Comcast and Charter and it's like

938
00:57:14,805 --> 00:57:18,385
Speaker 4:  the dying stars like Yeah. The thing that people are quitting in

939
00:57:18,445 --> 00:57:19,985
Speaker 4:  droves. Good luck. And the

940
00:57:20,345 --> 00:57:23,145
Speaker 5:  Companies who are now negotiating by saying, we don't need TV anymore because

941
00:57:23,145 --> 00:57:25,505
Speaker 5:  the only place we make money is through internet service. Yeah, perfect.

942
00:57:25,915 --> 00:57:26,345
Speaker 4:  It'll go great

943
00:57:26,765 --> 00:57:30,345
Speaker 6:  By the way they just like leaked the last four social security digits of

944
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:33,145
Speaker 6:  everyone who has internet service. Maybe so. Perfect.

945
00:57:33,605 --> 00:57:35,545
Speaker 4:  Anyway, so Comcast investor in our company,

946
00:57:37,585 --> 00:57:39,905
Speaker 4:  we, we made a Netflix show. It's nominated front of Emmy. It's called The

947
00:57:39,905 --> 00:57:43,225
Speaker 4:  Future I You should go watch it. We, our company makes other TV shows,

948
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:47,775
Speaker 4:  you know, the usual, I have a Disney account, I just went to Disney World.

949
00:57:48,295 --> 00:57:51,975
Speaker 4:  I does that count. I think the magic band is like neoliberal fantasy. Okay,

950
00:57:55,545 --> 00:57:59,365
Speaker 4:  that's good. Okay, last one. This is mine.

951
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:02,565
Speaker 4:  I think this, I think this is actually a fascinating too front. So Peloton,

952
00:58:03,545 --> 00:58:05,925
Speaker 4:  you know, they're a new CEO they went through, they also went through a big

953
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:10,045
Speaker 4:  pandemic over hire. They bought pre-core, they bought factories

954
00:58:10,425 --> 00:58:12,725
Speaker 4:  and then they went through a pandemic crash when people realized they could

955
00:58:12,725 --> 00:58:16,445
Speaker 4:  go back to the gym. So they, they were like reorganizing their business.

956
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:20,325
Speaker 4:  So I have two Peloton ones. They're kind of the same one I think in, in interesting

957
00:58:20,325 --> 00:58:24,285
Speaker 4:  ways. The first, if you have Peloton hardware in your house and you have

958
00:58:24,285 --> 00:58:28,205
Speaker 4:  the subscription, which is the plus tier of the subscription, you now don't

959
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:31,965
Speaker 4:  need the hardware. So you can now walk up to any treadmill that supports

960
00:58:31,965 --> 00:58:35,605
Speaker 4:  a Bluetooth protocol called FTMS and use the Peloton app

961
00:58:35,955 --> 00:58:38,765
Speaker 4:  with that treadmill, which is like pretty interesting and

962
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:42,525
Speaker 5:  It'll like keep track of the same data about how you're running and all that

963
00:58:42,525 --> 00:58:42,685
Speaker 5:  stuff.

964
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:46,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You get your incline speed, pace and distance in the app, which, you

965
00:58:46,325 --> 00:58:49,725
Speaker 4:  know, track it with the rest of the Peloton stuff. This is fascinating to

966
00:58:49,725 --> 00:58:53,205
Speaker 4:  me. Like just, they're just DB bundling their thing. Yeah, you obviously

967
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:56,925
Speaker 4:  need the more expensive subscription, which very much implies that you have

968
00:58:56,925 --> 00:59:00,565
Speaker 4:  the hardware, but they are db bundling it and then, you know,

969
00:59:00,565 --> 00:59:03,685
Speaker 4:  there's a weird little Bluetooth standard for people to argue about and figure

970
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:06,925
Speaker 4:  out what supports what. 'cause it hasn't really been important yet. And now

971
00:59:06,925 --> 00:59:10,085
Speaker 4:  Peloton is gonna make this weird little Bluetooth standard important next

972
00:59:10,085 --> 00:59:13,325
Speaker 4:  to that, their oldest bikes are

973
00:59:13,945 --> 00:59:17,925
Speaker 4:  20 15, 20 16. They're getting very old. And so they are

974
00:59:17,925 --> 00:59:21,725
Speaker 4:  gonna, they are no longer supporting the Android versions that

975
00:59:21,785 --> 00:59:25,525
Speaker 4:  run on those bikes tablets. So they will give you a $500

976
00:59:25,525 --> 00:59:28,525
Speaker 4:  credit to buy a new bike, which is very expensive.

977
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:32,605
Speaker 4:  Also, those bikes are always on sale, so it's nothing or this is really interesting.

978
00:59:32,755 --> 00:59:36,245
Speaker 4:  They will just sell you a new tablet for those bikes. Oh, the tablet is

979
00:59:36,245 --> 00:59:37,365
Speaker 4:  ridiculously expensive.

980
00:59:37,785 --> 00:59:41,125
Speaker 5:  So it's like the, it's like a dumb bike with a smart TV and you just replace

981
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:41,805
Speaker 5:  the smart tv.

982
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:45,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah, like there's, there's just a thing happening in Peloton world where

983
00:59:45,485 --> 00:59:48,165
Speaker 4:  they're realizing that the sort of computer part of it

984
00:59:49,245 --> 00:59:53,215
Speaker 4:  like can be fully disaggregated from the bike part of it or

985
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:57,095
Speaker 4:  the treadmill part of it. And so in, in the one sense they're actual hardware,

986
00:59:57,095 --> 01:00:00,215
Speaker 4:  they're just upgrading the hardware and there are some arguments in our comments

987
01:00:00,215 --> 01:00:03,615
Speaker 4:  and elsewhere about whether the price that upgrade is too high. It's, it's

988
01:00:03,815 --> 01:00:07,615
Speaker 4:  normally $375, but if your bike is expiring they'll give you a

989
01:00:07,615 --> 01:00:11,175
Speaker 4:  $50 credit. So it's $325. That's a lot To buy a new tablet. That's a lot

990
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:14,495
Speaker 4:  for like a what is not the world's greatest Android tablet, you know, on

991
01:00:14,495 --> 01:00:17,935
Speaker 5:  Top of the very expensive thing that you already bought and have paying for

992
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:19,775
Speaker 5:  for a long time you already purchase. Yeah, that's a lot. Yep.

993
01:00:19,885 --> 01:00:23,095
Speaker 4:  This is a lot. but it is interesting, right? You can just put a new computer

994
01:00:23,115 --> 01:00:26,955
Speaker 4:  on it and then on the, on the other side of it, you can

995
01:00:26,955 --> 01:00:30,755
Speaker 4:  just get a treadmill that supports this Bluetooth protocol, buy the more

996
01:00:30,755 --> 01:00:34,715
Speaker 4:  expensive subscription and use your own tablet. So you kinda

997
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:38,275
Speaker 4:  just see like the, the, the nature of this company's relationship to hardware,

998
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:42,275
Speaker 4:  software subscriptions is changing a little bit in a way that you can, you

999
01:00:42,275 --> 01:00:44,715
Speaker 4:  can get to a place where you're paying too much money for a Peloton subscription

1000
01:00:45,015 --> 01:00:48,435
Speaker 4:  and you have neither their treadmill nor their tablet

1001
01:00:49,965 --> 01:00:53,905
Speaker 4:  and their app is just talking to your treadmill on your iPad and that's like,

1002
01:00:53,905 --> 01:00:55,905
Speaker 4:  oh, now it's a totally different company. It

1003
01:00:55,905 --> 01:00:58,945
Speaker 6:  It just, it just feels like what Peloton always should have been. Yep. Kind

1004
01:00:58,945 --> 01:01:02,865
Speaker 6:  of an add-on that. They didn't need to be the new exercise bike company,

1005
01:01:03,005 --> 01:01:06,825
Speaker 6:  but I assume that they registered probably correctly that if they tried to

1006
01:01:06,825 --> 01:01:09,465
Speaker 6:  launch with something like this, either the technology wasn't ready at the

1007
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:13,105
Speaker 6:  time, which I can believe to an extent or if they did deliver

1008
01:01:13,345 --> 01:01:16,385
Speaker 6:  it and it did work that one of the big, big bike companies would just make

1009
01:01:16,385 --> 01:01:19,505
Speaker 6:  their own version and they would get frozen out. But we had to go through

1010
01:01:19,505 --> 01:01:20,585
Speaker 6:  this whole 10 years of waste.

1011
01:01:20,815 --> 01:01:23,345
Speaker 4:  It's interesting to put it in the context of the streaming conversation.

1012
01:01:23,895 --> 01:01:27,345
Speaker 4:  Like Pelotons real differentiation, is it, it's instructors, right? They've

1013
01:01:27,345 --> 01:01:30,745
Speaker 4:  like, yep. They put on a show. The, the shows have communities around them.

1014
01:01:30,765 --> 01:01:34,585
Speaker 4:  The instructors have people, the hardware's good. We, Becky has a Peloton

1015
01:01:34,745 --> 01:01:38,225
Speaker 4:  treadmill, I have a Peloton bike, they're really good. We use them a lot.

1016
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:43,505
Speaker 4:  I can see how having them integrated is a superior experience to,

1017
01:01:43,505 --> 01:01:46,825
Speaker 4:  if I was like cobbling together an iPad with something else and like needing

1018
01:01:46,825 --> 01:01:48,425
Speaker 4:  a Bluetooth protocol to work. Yeah. I

1019
01:01:48,425 --> 01:01:51,825
Speaker 5:  Mean anyone who's ever like tried to pair their phone to the treadmill at

1020
01:01:51,825 --> 01:01:54,705
Speaker 5:  the gym like that, that experience can suck real bad. Yeah.

1021
01:01:54,725 --> 01:01:57,705
Speaker 4:  But what's fascinating about this is Richard, your point is they could have

1022
01:01:57,705 --> 01:02:01,455
Speaker 4:  just made it all about the content and maybe that would've been better, but

1023
01:02:02,095 --> 01:02:05,015
Speaker 4:  I think you need something to sell. Like Apple Fitness Plus is all about

1024
01:02:05,015 --> 01:02:08,495
Speaker 4:  the content and I don't think it's nearly as successful as Peloton and I,

1025
01:02:08,515 --> 01:02:11,255
Speaker 4:  you know, like Apple's, like you just bring your own bike and no one does

1026
01:02:11,255 --> 01:02:14,575
Speaker 4:  it. Like no one caress. No. So there's something in there that I think is

1027
01:02:14,575 --> 01:02:18,375
Speaker 4:  just Nexus streaming conversation, Peloton sort of DB bundling

1028
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:22,125
Speaker 4:  itself in this way, way is like fascinating. And then there's a wonky Bluetooth

1029
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:24,845
Speaker 4:  standard which is suddenly gonna become more important. That's correct. And

1030
01:02:24,845 --> 01:02:26,205
Speaker 4:  you know, I can't stay away from the

1031
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:29,325
Speaker 5:  Dream holiday spectacular 2024 Peloton Bluetooth.

1032
01:02:30,345 --> 01:02:33,085
Speaker 5:  No. The thing I think is interesting about this is like Richard, I think

1033
01:02:33,435 --> 01:02:37,325
Speaker 5:  that arc you described is like exactly what Peloton should have

1034
01:02:37,445 --> 01:02:40,965
Speaker 5:  done and potentially was always going to do. Like no one

1035
01:02:41,265 --> 01:02:45,085
Speaker 5:  at Peloton I'm sure was like, we can sell $1,800 bikes to

1036
01:02:45,085 --> 01:02:48,005
Speaker 5:  every single person on Earth. They're like, we're gonna sell these bikes

1037
01:02:48,005 --> 01:02:51,765
Speaker 5:  to as like the luxury item and that's where we start and then we become a

1038
01:02:51,765 --> 01:02:55,565
Speaker 5:  content business to the rest of people. And that

1039
01:02:55,585 --> 01:02:58,685
Speaker 5:  all would've worked just fine, except they absolutely lost their mind in

1040
01:02:58,685 --> 01:03:01,445
Speaker 5:  the middle of the pandemic. Yep. When everybody bought a Peloton. And so

1041
01:03:01,605 --> 01:03:04,085
Speaker 5:  suddenly they were like, oh, maybe the market is bigger than we thought.

1042
01:03:04,385 --> 01:03:08,325
Speaker 5:  And what it actually was was just that they did the 10 years of business

1043
01:03:08,325 --> 01:03:11,285
Speaker 5:  they were ever going to do in like three months and

1044
01:03:12,325 --> 01:03:15,525
Speaker 5:  suddenly they were, instead of there being 10 times as many people who might

1045
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:19,325
Speaker 5:  buy a Peloton, which is what they decided was the case, it was actually just

1046
01:03:19,325 --> 01:03:22,125
Speaker 5:  that everyone who was ever going to buy a Peloton had already bought a Peloton.

1047
01:03:22,305 --> 01:03:25,165
Speaker 5:  So if they had shifted right then and been like, okay, we've hit the group,

1048
01:03:25,545 --> 01:03:28,565
Speaker 5:  now we're gonna be a content business. Peloton might be in a really different

1049
01:03:28,565 --> 01:03:31,645
Speaker 5:  place. Yeah. But instead, like you said, Eli bought factories and bought

1050
01:03:31,885 --> 01:03:34,005
Speaker 5:  companies and was like, we're going all in on weird hardware.

1051
01:03:34,265 --> 01:03:37,925
Speaker 4:  And what what's particularly interesting about that is along the way the

1052
01:03:38,405 --> 01:03:41,725
Speaker 4:  CEO of Peloton got pushed out for making those decisions and they brought

1053
01:03:41,725 --> 01:03:45,685
Speaker 4:  in the new guy Barry McCarthy, ex Netflix, who is now

1054
01:03:45,685 --> 01:03:49,325
Speaker 4:  running a Netflix playbook. Oh yeah. By dis-aggregating the service and the

1055
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,485
Speaker 4:  content from the hardware.

1056
01:03:52,065 --> 01:03:54,525
Speaker 4:  So I said, it was just we, we were talking about streaming. I was like, oh

1057
01:03:54,525 --> 01:03:57,405
Speaker 4:  this Peloton, there's something right there that's the same thing. The

1058
01:03:57,405 --> 01:04:00,565
Speaker 6:  Difference between them in streaming is that Peloton also released a treadmill

1059
01:04:00,565 --> 01:04:01,365
Speaker 6:  that killed a child.

1060
01:04:01,785 --> 01:04:02,605
Speaker 4:  That's true. Which

1061
01:04:03,065 --> 01:04:03,805
Speaker 6:  Is probably,

1062
01:04:04,185 --> 01:04:07,125
Speaker 4:  Hey that one they're, they're about to release it. It's true that it was

1063
01:04:07,295 --> 01:04:11,085
Speaker 4:  oddly dangerous. Yeah. Like too dangerous and it went away.

1064
01:04:11,425 --> 01:04:14,845
Speaker 4:  And now on their website you can pre-order the new one, which is the same

1065
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:19,805
Speaker 4:  don don't know. It's very confusing. All. right on that very dark

1066
01:04:19,805 --> 01:04:22,925
Speaker 4:  note. Thank you Richard. We're gonna take a break. We're come back. We're

1067
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:26,525
Speaker 4:  gonna do what I think will be very fun. Your interview, we'll wrap back.

1068
01:05:27,605 --> 01:05:27,925
Speaker 12:  safely.

1069
01:05:33,575 --> 01:05:37,175
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. So David had an idea

1070
01:05:37,635 --> 01:05:41,535
Speaker 4:  to just go through all of our top stories for

1071
01:05:41,535 --> 01:05:45,295
Speaker 4:  the year, but then this idea got complicated by the idea of how you would

1072
01:05:45,295 --> 01:05:47,175
Speaker 4:  make such a list. David, what have

1073
01:05:47,175 --> 01:05:50,815
Speaker 5:  You done? Yeah, So. I. When I raised that I wanted to do some kind of end

1074
01:05:50,815 --> 01:05:54,255
Speaker 5:  of the year thing. I was like, how do we sort of pick out

1075
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:57,735
Speaker 5:  the biggest stories of the year? Do we all come with our ideas for the biggest

1076
01:05:57,735 --> 01:06:00,455
Speaker 5:  stories? Do we come up with a list and try to rank them? And you were just

1077
01:06:00,455 --> 01:06:04,415
Speaker 5:  like, what if we just like took the top posts on The Verge dot com and

1078
01:06:05,005 --> 01:06:08,095
Speaker 5:  went through them all and decided like were those actually the top stories

1079
01:06:08,095 --> 01:06:09,575
Speaker 5:  of the year? And I was like, cool. Sounds fun.

1080
01:06:11,215 --> 01:06:14,095
Speaker 5:  Horrible idea. We're gonna do it. but it was a horrible idea.

1081
01:06:15,435 --> 01:06:19,295
Speaker 5:  So we went through and basically two ways that we measure traffic

1082
01:06:19,295 --> 01:06:22,495
Speaker 5:  on The Verge dot com are through Google Analytics and through a tool called

1083
01:06:22,525 --> 01:06:25,775
Speaker 5:  Parsley. They, it turns out have very different ideas

1084
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:30,215
Speaker 5:  about how much traffic a page is getting So. What I ultimately did was

1085
01:06:30,215 --> 01:06:34,135
Speaker 5:  look at both of them and then I sort of triangulated a

1086
01:06:34,135 --> 01:06:38,015
Speaker 5:  list of the most popular VERGE stories of 2023. But

1087
01:06:38,195 --> 01:06:41,815
Speaker 5:  in order to do that you have to get rid of all the stories that are just

1088
01:06:41,815 --> 01:06:45,535
Speaker 5:  like obviously successful because people search for those things all the

1089
01:06:45,535 --> 01:06:49,055
Speaker 5:  time. Right. Like a piece of fun inside baseball is that the single most

1090
01:06:49,055 --> 01:06:52,895
Speaker 5:  popular VERGE URL after our homepage in 2023

1091
01:06:53,435 --> 01:06:57,215
Speaker 5:  was our roundup of the best wireless earbuds. Sure.

1092
01:06:57,855 --> 01:07:00,135
Speaker 5:  And there's tons of those, right? We do buying guides, they're really good,

1093
01:07:00,135 --> 01:07:02,335
Speaker 5:  they're really helpful. Lots of people find them. Lots of people I stuff

1094
01:07:02,565 --> 01:07:06,375
Speaker 5:  it's great. Then we have things like explainers. we have an NFT

1095
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:10,175
Speaker 5:  explainer from like two years ago I think. Yep.

1096
01:07:10,725 --> 01:07:13,655
Speaker 5:  That is still lingering as one of our most popular stories.

1097
01:07:14,355 --> 01:07:17,735
Speaker 4:  The best part about that explainer by the way is it's, is it's Mitchell Clark

1098
01:07:17,855 --> 01:07:20,535
Speaker 4:  I believe wrote it and it is basically a reason why no one should buy an

1099
01:07:20,535 --> 01:07:21,175
Speaker 4:  NFT. It's

1100
01:07:21,175 --> 01:07:23,575
Speaker 5:  Also the reason Mitchell Clark left the Virgin and like moved to the woods.

1101
01:07:23,965 --> 01:07:24,255
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1102
01:07:24,405 --> 01:07:28,375
Speaker 4:  He's like, I need to walk around the west coast for a long time and he is

1103
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:29,335
Speaker 4:  been doing ever since. Yeah.

1104
01:07:30,355 --> 01:07:33,855
Speaker 5:  And then, yeah and then we, there were like some random things that we just

1105
01:07:33,855 --> 01:07:37,295
Speaker 5:  left off because they're popular for reasons that are not newsworthiness.

1106
01:07:37,295 --> 01:07:41,175
Speaker 5:  Like a sort of one-off story that James Vincent on our team wrote about

1107
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:44,975
Speaker 5:  deep fake nudes that for reasons don don't need to explain but are very

1108
01:07:44,975 --> 01:07:47,655
Speaker 5:  obvious, was very popular on the internet all year.

1109
01:07:49,115 --> 01:07:52,735
Speaker 5:  So point is, I whittled all this down into I think an imperfect but like

1110
01:07:52,765 --> 01:07:56,495
Speaker 5:  directionally useful list of the

1111
01:07:56,495 --> 01:07:59,935
Speaker 5:  most popular stories on The Verge dot com in 2023

1112
01:08:00,185 --> 01:08:00,535
Speaker 5:  minus

1113
01:08:00,555 --> 01:08:02,215
Speaker 4:  The list of best laptops minus

1114
01:08:02,235 --> 01:08:04,855
Speaker 5:  The list of best laptops. Yeah. And which

1115
01:08:04,935 --> 01:08:05,535
Speaker 4:  Is a great list.

1116
01:08:06,075 --> 01:08:09,935
Speaker 5:  Oh, tons of good stuff. I, I highly recommend Googling all those things

1117
01:08:10,075 --> 01:08:13,255
Speaker 5:  and clicking on The Verge links many times so that they keep being popular

1118
01:08:13,315 --> 01:08:17,125
Speaker 5:  in 2024 and So. what I wanna do with each of these is just go through

1119
01:08:17,745 --> 01:08:21,525
Speaker 5:  and basically I wanna decide for each of these, does this

1120
01:08:21,545 --> 01:08:25,245
Speaker 5:  belong on like biggest stories of 2023 list? Because a lot of these, they

1121
01:08:25,245 --> 01:08:28,885
Speaker 5:  have their moments, people get very excited, like there's a huge sort of

1122
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:31,405
Speaker 5:  spike in interest in traffic and then they die out. Others live much longer.

1123
01:08:31,705 --> 01:08:34,565
Speaker 5:  So I wanna go through and see like, does this merit

1124
01:08:35,725 --> 01:08:39,445
Speaker 5:  a list of the best biggest stories of 2023?

1125
01:08:40,105 --> 01:08:43,845
Speaker 5:  And the first one, and again I'm going in a pure list of

1126
01:08:43,845 --> 01:08:47,805
Speaker 5:  popularity. This has no, no judgment. The first one

1127
01:08:48,025 --> 01:08:51,725
Speaker 5:  is a big feature we wrote about Inside Elon Musk's, extremely

1128
01:08:52,245 --> 01:08:55,125
Speaker 5:  hardcore Twitter. And there were a few others on this list, including the

1129
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:58,845
Speaker 5:  one where Elon Musk predicted that X will replace banks. He gave

1130
01:08:59,085 --> 01:09:02,405
Speaker 5:  employees a year to replace banks. Yeah. And then there was the whole

1131
01:09:02,455 --> 01:09:06,365
Speaker 5:  Zuckerberg Elon Musk cage match challenge. So I've just boiled all of this

1132
01:09:06,365 --> 01:09:10,205
Speaker 5:  down to Musk Twitter X shenanigans. Yeah.

1133
01:09:10,945 --> 01:09:13,165
Speaker 4:  The one thing I'll point out, just having looked at the list

1134
01:09:15,065 --> 01:09:18,925
Speaker 4:  You don, I don't often think about our URL slugs and the Zuckerberg versus

1135
01:09:19,115 --> 01:09:23,005
Speaker 4:  Musk slug had the word world star in it, which is just the funniest thing.

1136
01:09:23,005 --> 01:09:23,205
Speaker 4:  That's

1137
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:23,485
Speaker 5:  Fantastic.

1138
01:09:25,505 --> 01:09:28,645
Speaker 4:  It was like Musk Zuckerberg cage match

1139
01:09:28,955 --> 01:09:32,845
Speaker 4:  worldstar and it just did numbers. And now I, now I've learned an important

1140
01:09:32,845 --> 01:09:35,725
Speaker 4:  lesson about putting word worldstar in all of our headphones. There you go.

1141
01:09:35,825 --> 01:09:36,725
Speaker 4:  All of our headlines.

1142
01:09:38,405 --> 01:09:40,645
Speaker 4:  I see why this is the, this is the biggest story of the year

1143
01:09:40,745 --> 01:09:41,845
Speaker 5:  It deserves to be here. Right?

1144
01:09:41,975 --> 01:09:44,725
Speaker 4:  Right. I mean it it, we've talked about this now at length. We've done a

1145
01:09:44,725 --> 01:09:47,845
Speaker 4:  huge package on it. Like this thing

1146
01:09:48,195 --> 01:09:52,185
Speaker 4:  catalyzed a reordering of the internet and, and maybe you think

1147
01:09:52,205 --> 01:09:55,985
Speaker 4:  I'm going too far. I really think that that's true. And the only thing that

1148
01:09:56,125 --> 01:10:00,105
Speaker 4:  I'm missing when I say that is also the whole AI Google search dilemma

1149
01:10:00,165 --> 01:10:03,865
Speaker 4:  is like right next to that. But this thing just catalyzed

1150
01:10:04,585 --> 01:10:08,505
Speaker 4:  a rethinking of the social internet in big ways. It threads is the number

1151
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:12,345
Speaker 4:  one app on the app store. Macedon is growing interest in activity,

1152
01:10:12,365 --> 01:10:14,705
Speaker 4:  pub is growing threads, is gonna do activity. Like all of that

1153
01:10:15,775 --> 01:10:19,665
Speaker 4:  massively catalyzed by Elon's purchase

1154
01:10:19,665 --> 01:10:23,425
Speaker 4:  of Twitter. Then next to that, you know that story extremely hardcore.

1155
01:10:24,245 --> 01:10:28,185
Speaker 4:  You know, I'm just like a Verge level. We co-produced that story with

1156
01:10:28,185 --> 01:10:32,065
Speaker 4:  New York Magazine. It was on the cover of New York Magazine. We made

1157
01:10:32,065 --> 01:10:35,785
Speaker 4:  that story with Casey and Zoe, a Platformer and Alex Heath on our team.

1158
01:10:36,485 --> 01:10:40,335
Speaker 4:  So it was just like, just from me personally, like

1159
01:10:40,495 --> 01:10:43,455
Speaker 4:  a lot of people had to work together in a way that people in media don't

1160
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,215
Speaker 4:  often work together to make something really great. That story's really great

1161
01:10:46,555 --> 01:10:49,975
Speaker 4:  and it is the story of a culture change inside of a company

1162
01:10:50,475 --> 01:10:53,375
Speaker 4:  and what it was like in those early days. Tons and tons and tons of great

1163
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:57,255
Speaker 4:  reporting. And that immediately led to not like just

1164
01:10:57,255 --> 01:11:00,735
Speaker 4:  reflection, obviously interest, but a bunch of other companies being like,

1165
01:11:00,805 --> 01:11:03,975
Speaker 4:  what if we were a little bit more hardcore? And you just immediately saw

1166
01:11:03,975 --> 01:11:04,415
Speaker 4:  that Yeah,

1167
01:11:04,415 --> 01:11:04,855
Speaker 5:  That's right.

1168
01:11:04,965 --> 01:11:06,655
Speaker 4:  Pinging pong around sort of tech culture.

1169
01:11:06,805 --> 01:11:10,375
Speaker 5:  Yeah. There was that brief moment where everybody was taking a page out of

1170
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:13,805
Speaker 5:  Musk's book and being like, that was like how a lot of people excused bringing

1171
01:11:13,805 --> 01:11:16,685
Speaker 5:  people back to the office. They were like, it's time to Yep. It's time to

1172
01:11:16,685 --> 01:11:19,085
Speaker 5:  get serious. Like stop being so nice to your employees.

1173
01:11:19,315 --> 01:11:22,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We're gonna lay off a bunch of you. It was like a real thing that happened.

1174
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:25,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Sort of in the wake of Elon. Yeah. Like what if we had 50% less people

1175
01:11:25,465 --> 01:11:27,765
Speaker 4:  and then a bunch of companies realized like, oh that wouldn't work. And Elon

1176
01:11:27,765 --> 01:11:28,885
Speaker 4:  was like, what if we did it again?

1177
01:11:30,155 --> 01:11:33,565
Speaker 5:  Well, we're gonna get to the layoffs in a minute here. Yeah. But Richard,

1178
01:11:34,065 --> 01:11:36,765
Speaker 5:  you sit in the news all day. This is, this is the biggest story of the year.

1179
01:11:36,765 --> 01:11:37,005
Speaker 5:  Right.

1180
01:11:37,605 --> 01:11:41,525
Speaker 6:  I was at a holiday party for my wife's job the other day and I,

1181
01:11:41,605 --> 01:11:44,725
Speaker 6:  I was telling them kind of what it's like to work in this job. And

1182
01:11:45,315 --> 01:11:48,805
Speaker 6:  this year really for the last few years, a lot of it has been, oh, Elon just

1183
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:52,765
Speaker 6:  did a thing over and over and over

1184
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:56,605
Speaker 6:  again. If you are tired of reading the news, I am tired of

1185
01:11:56,605 --> 01:12:00,365
Speaker 6:  thinking about writing it and talking about it. The number of

1186
01:12:00,365 --> 01:12:04,045
Speaker 6:  stories that we did not write is much longer than the story number of stories

1187
01:12:04,045 --> 01:12:06,645
Speaker 6:  that we published or that we considered. and it's one of those things where

1188
01:12:07,275 --> 01:12:10,205
Speaker 6:  Neil, I think you're, you're extremely right about all the things that it

1189
01:12:10,205 --> 01:12:13,285
Speaker 6:  covered, but it was even more than that. It was security, it was policy,

1190
01:12:13,425 --> 01:12:16,885
Speaker 6:  it was international. Even the layoffs, how they happen in different countries

1191
01:12:16,885 --> 01:12:20,645
Speaker 6:  across different continents and were affected by different laws. We had the

1192
01:12:20,645 --> 01:12:23,485
Speaker 6:  lawsuit, we had the whistleblower who came back and said that Twitter was

1193
01:12:23,825 --> 01:12:27,445
Speaker 6:  wildly insecure before and talked about the things that the previous administration

1194
01:12:27,545 --> 01:12:27,965
Speaker 6:  was doing.

1195
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:32,755
Speaker 6:  We, we had the, the woman who was sleeping in her cubicle Yeah.

1196
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,155
Speaker 4:  Who then got fired and later

1197
01:12:34,175 --> 01:12:38,155
Speaker 6:  Got fired. It was a, it was a momentary star. We, we had, there were

1198
01:12:38,155 --> 01:12:40,795
Speaker 6:  just so many things that happened. I, I can't remember all of them. Or even

1199
01:12:41,135 --> 01:12:42,275
Speaker 6:  one 10th I think. Yeah.

1200
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:46,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think that's right. I think which is impressive actually. 'cause

1201
01:12:46,325 --> 01:12:48,925
Speaker 5:  that means Elon Musk is the story of the year, two years in a row because

1202
01:12:48,945 --> 01:12:52,565
Speaker 5:  all of the chaos of the acquisition was very much that thing in 2022.

1203
01:12:54,105 --> 01:12:57,045
Speaker 5:  So here's hoping we don't make it a threepeat. On that note, let's move on

1204
01:12:57,835 --> 01:13:01,605
Speaker 5:  next on the list. I I, I would not have put this second, but I'm not

1205
01:13:01,605 --> 01:13:05,485
Speaker 5:  surprised it's actually here is the Vision Pro are are just in

1206
01:13:06,035 --> 01:13:09,325
Speaker 5:  initial announcement post was number two

1207
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:13,805
Speaker 5:  and Neli, you're hands on getting to

1208
01:13:13,805 --> 01:13:14,445
Speaker 5:  try it face

1209
01:13:14,445 --> 01:13:14,605
Speaker 4:  On

1210
01:13:14,955 --> 01:13:18,045
Speaker 5:  Your face on was also on this list too.

1211
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:21,895
Speaker 5:  Not surprising to me that this is the gadget of the year. Right? Yeah.

1212
01:13:21,895 --> 01:13:24,175
Speaker 4:  It's the newest, most impressive thing.

1213
01:13:25,675 --> 01:13:29,215
Speaker 4:  It has the biggest ideas. It had the flashiest launch. It's, it's Apple.

1214
01:13:29,435 --> 01:13:33,375
Speaker 4:  You know, Apple's always gonna be on that list. I'll, I'll just do a

1215
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:36,895
Speaker 4:  spoiler way down on this list, but still in the top whatever, 50

1216
01:13:37,735 --> 01:13:41,015
Speaker 4:  D iPhone, 15 pro. Like it's just, it's just there. Yep. I get it. And also

1217
01:13:41,015 --> 01:13:43,535
Speaker 4:  people are just really curious, you know, it's like a new hardware category

1218
01:13:43,535 --> 01:13:46,455
Speaker 4:  from Apple, what are they gonna do better than everyone else?

1219
01:13:47,535 --> 01:13:51,315
Speaker 4:  I think that some of that interest will carry through the

1220
01:13:51,315 --> 01:13:55,285
Speaker 4:  actual launch. But you know what surprised me is that the HandsOn did

1221
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:58,245
Speaker 4:  as well because it was, as I was writing it, I was like, there's no way to

1222
01:13:58,245 --> 01:14:00,205
Speaker 4:  convey what's actually happening. Yeah.

1223
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:00,605
Speaker 5:  Like

1224
01:14:00,745 --> 01:14:03,925
Speaker 4:  You just, you're, I'm dancing with architecture like I'm, I'm doing the thing

1225
01:14:03,925 --> 01:14:07,165
Speaker 4:  here where like I can't take a picture of it. I can't show it to you. I can

1226
01:14:07,165 --> 01:14:09,085
Speaker 4:  just write about it around, around it, you

1227
01:14:09,085 --> 01:14:12,565
Speaker 5:  Know? Yeah. I was sitting one table over from you

1228
01:14:12,905 --> 01:14:16,605
Speaker 5:  at Apple Park in their visitor center while you were writing this story and

1229
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:19,925
Speaker 5:  you came out and you were just like, I think I just have to write about all

1230
01:14:19,945 --> 01:14:23,325
Speaker 5:  the things that happened in a row and I think that's all I can do. And I

1231
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:26,685
Speaker 5:  was like, yeah, I think that's all you can do. That's what you did. Turned

1232
01:14:26,685 --> 01:14:27,685
Speaker 5:  out people liked it worked out great.

1233
01:14:28,035 --> 01:14:28,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1234
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:32,165
Speaker 5:  All right. Number three on the list was, I believe this was Liz

1235
01:14:32,305 --> 01:14:36,245
Speaker 5:  Lipato on the last day of the Sam Bankman free trial. Her headline was Sam

1236
01:14:36,245 --> 01:14:40,165
Speaker 5:  Bankman Fried gambled on a trial and his parents lost. But I think to some

1237
01:14:40,165 --> 01:14:44,085
Speaker 5:  extent, A, this is a terrific piece, but B was

1238
01:14:44,865 --> 01:14:48,725
Speaker 5:  the, the summary of the S-B-F-F-T-X

1239
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:52,605
Speaker 5:  trial, which Richard like definitely belongs on this list.

1240
01:14:52,605 --> 01:14:54,845
Speaker 5:  Right. Biggest stories of the year. Surely

1241
01:14:55,485 --> 01:14:59,325
Speaker 6:  O over the last year we saw this kind of coming at the end of 2022 as

1242
01:14:59,485 --> 01:15:03,245
Speaker 6:  FTX collapsed, Sam, Bankman Fried went on a massive media tour and then he

1243
01:15:03,245 --> 01:15:04,045
Speaker 6:  was arrested. Right.

1244
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:05,405
Speaker 5:  Like you do

1245
01:15:05,645 --> 01:15:07,645
Speaker 6:  A very strange sequence of events

1246
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:12,845
Speaker 6:  arrested and extradited from The Bahamas. And then we had the trial and it

1247
01:15:12,845 --> 01:15:16,605
Speaker 6:  all kind of wrapped up within a year. And I think the verdict came in a year

1248
01:15:16,605 --> 01:15:20,525
Speaker 6:  to the day after CoinDesk had published this kind of expose of what turned

1249
01:15:20,525 --> 01:15:24,105
Speaker 6:  out to be just one of their balance sheets showing some really

1250
01:15:24,105 --> 01:15:27,265
Speaker 6:  serious problems within FTX. But Liz,

1251
01:15:27,985 --> 01:15:31,745
Speaker 6:  I thought that in particular this piece dug into the personal side of it

1252
01:15:31,805 --> 01:15:35,785
Speaker 6:  of who Sam Bankman Fried was and what it meant for him to

1253
01:15:36,015 --> 01:15:39,945
Speaker 6:  view the world in the way that he did and how that resulted in both the

1254
01:15:39,945 --> 01:15:43,905
Speaker 6:  growth of FTX, the way that the investors and the people who backed it were

1255
01:15:43,905 --> 01:15:47,745
Speaker 6:  kind of drawn into it and they saw an opportunity in, in this person

1256
01:15:47,965 --> 01:15:51,945
Speaker 6:  and in this company. And then what happened after it all

1257
01:15:51,945 --> 01:15:55,675
Speaker 6:  fell apart and after he was on trial and why, why someone

1258
01:15:55,845 --> 01:15:59,715
Speaker 6:  would go to trial on this, why they would risk all of this. When we all saw

1259
01:15:59,715 --> 01:16:03,035
Speaker 6:  it, when we all read it and we were like, yeah, he's going to be found guilty.

1260
01:16:03,035 --> 01:16:05,915
Speaker 6:  Right. And he was, yeah, but how, how we got there.

1261
01:16:06,275 --> 01:16:10,035
Speaker 4:  I always think that the tagline for The Verge is how technology

1262
01:16:10,035 --> 01:16:13,765
Speaker 4:  makes us feel. You know, it's just like it doesn't work in ad meetings. Like

1263
01:16:13,765 --> 01:16:17,365
Speaker 4:  that's where you need tagline, what we're excited about the future, whatever.

1264
01:16:17,365 --> 01:16:20,885
Speaker 4:  But this one to me is like a perfect encapsulation of that. Like

1265
01:16:21,015 --> 01:16:24,325
Speaker 4:  we're not a financial publication, we're not really a business publication.

1266
01:16:24,325 --> 01:16:27,885
Speaker 4:  Sometimes I think we're like a secret business publication. We're, we cover

1267
01:16:27,885 --> 01:16:31,685
Speaker 4:  tech really closely, but we cover like this very human part of it. We

1268
01:16:31,685 --> 01:16:35,245
Speaker 4:  spend a lot of time on that thing. And to me, Liz just

1269
01:16:35,415 --> 01:16:38,885
Speaker 4:  found that line in this trial. Her, her coverage of this trial through and

1270
01:16:38,885 --> 01:16:42,685
Speaker 4:  through was amazing. Yeah. But this one, it just made

1271
01:16:42,685 --> 01:16:46,445
Speaker 4:  it sad. Like yes, he scanned a lot of people out of a lot of money. Yes.

1272
01:16:46,505 --> 01:16:50,445
Speaker 4:  All this stuff. And there's just a sadness to it. And if you even read the

1273
01:16:50,605 --> 01:16:54,005
Speaker 4:  comments or like to people posting on threads about it or whatever, people

1274
01:16:54,005 --> 01:16:57,805
Speaker 4:  caught that sadness and it really resonated with him. Like, if you're just

1275
01:16:57,885 --> 01:17:01,125
Speaker 4:  a parent and your kid has this big belief and he is on the rocket ride, like

1276
01:17:02,205 --> 01:17:05,865
Speaker 4:  you're, you're just not motivated to be like, well my kid's a shit.

1277
01:17:06,265 --> 01:17:09,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And there's just something in there. It is. It's worth reading and

1278
01:17:09,405 --> 01:17:13,365
Speaker 4:  just like really sitting with, 'cause Liz caught it like Exactly. And she

1279
01:17:13,365 --> 01:17:16,445
Speaker 4:  was in the courtroom every day and she was just watching this happen to these

1280
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:19,525
Speaker 4:  people. And there's something in there that I think is just really powerful.

1281
01:17:19,525 --> 01:17:22,485
Speaker 4:  It's like, it's very literary. It's like what I want The Verge to be at.

1282
01:17:22,485 --> 01:17:25,845
Speaker 4:  Its, its best even that it was a trial about cryptocurrency scams. Yeah.

1283
01:17:26,155 --> 01:17:30,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I will say it, this is a totally unfair thing to say whatever, six

1284
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:33,245
Speaker 5:  and a half weeks after the trial, but there has been less

1285
01:17:34,475 --> 01:17:38,205
Speaker 5:  ongoing fallout from the FTX trial than I expected. I'm sure there's a lot

1286
01:17:38,205 --> 01:17:41,565
Speaker 5:  of stuff brewing, but when the trial ended it felt like a lot of people kind

1287
01:17:41,565 --> 01:17:44,845
Speaker 5:  of, you know, white wiped their hands of it and moved on at their lives.

1288
01:17:44,845 --> 01:17:45,805
Speaker 5:  It was like, oh, oh no

1289
01:17:46,325 --> 01:17:50,205
Speaker 4:  Here. Here's one thing I know Richard remembers the

1290
01:17:50,205 --> 01:17:50,925
Speaker 4:  people who use, I

1291
01:17:51,085 --> 01:17:54,645
Speaker 6:  Remember everyone who ever tried to sell an NFT and I will follow them

1292
01:17:54,835 --> 01:17:56,485
Speaker 6:  forever. It'll never

1293
01:17:56,485 --> 01:18:00,085
Speaker 4:  Drop receipts. Lawler over here has not forgotten a goddamn thing.

1294
01:18:00,915 --> 01:18:01,325
Speaker 5:  What I

1295
01:18:01,325 --> 01:18:03,845
Speaker 6:  Was gonna say is there, there actually has been some fallout. We've seen

1296
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:07,405
Speaker 6:  several other executives go down. That's true. We've seen Binance started

1297
01:18:07,465 --> 01:18:11,285
Speaker 6:  the entire run against FTX. They have had a guilty plea to criminal charges.

1298
01:18:11,285 --> 01:18:14,565
Speaker 6:  Their CEO is in America and cannot leave because he is a flight risk

1299
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:18,185
Speaker 6:  there. There are still things going on. I think we're gonna, we're gonna

1300
01:18:18,185 --> 01:18:20,985
Speaker 6:  see these echoes just con kind of continue throughout crypto and throughout

1301
01:18:20,985 --> 01:18:21,945
Speaker 6:  the financial industry. Yeah.

1302
01:18:22,295 --> 01:18:22,585
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1303
01:18:23,125 --> 01:18:26,985
Speaker 5:  All, right. Next one. This is just to, you know, take you further

1304
01:18:27,085 --> 01:18:30,785
Speaker 5:  inside the parsley Google analytics thing on Google Analytics.

1305
01:18:30,895 --> 01:18:34,585
Speaker 5:  This was I think in like the top three most popular stories of the year.

1306
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,865
Speaker 5:  and it was nowhere on parsley, So, I, don't know what to make of that. So

1307
01:18:36,865 --> 01:18:40,825
Speaker 5:  I, just put it in here. This is Gen Two's story about Amazon opening

1308
01:18:40,825 --> 01:18:44,625
Speaker 5:  up its Sidewalk network to give any gadget free low speed data. I

1309
01:18:44,825 --> 01:18:47,785
Speaker 5:  remember being very surprised at how well this story was doing at the time.

1310
01:18:48,175 --> 01:18:51,465
Speaker 5:  It's a good story. But like I was shocked that that many people care about

1311
01:18:51,745 --> 01:18:52,545
Speaker 5:  Sidewalk as a thing.

1312
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:57,085
Speaker 4:  I'm convinced that the words free data are the

1313
01:18:57,085 --> 01:18:57,245
Speaker 4:  thing

1314
01:18:57,525 --> 01:18:58,125
Speaker 5:  That's interesting.

1315
01:18:58,825 --> 01:19:02,295
Speaker 4:  Right? Any gadget free data, you get it. It's fair.

1316
01:19:02,895 --> 01:19:05,935
Speaker 4:  I immediately understood people are out there in the streets with their chums

1317
01:19:05,935 --> 01:19:07,855
Speaker 4:  when like, how do I connect to these Sidewalk networks?

1318
01:19:08,095 --> 01:19:11,295
Speaker 6:  There was also a sort of weird discussion that popped up around this where

1319
01:19:11,295 --> 01:19:14,655
Speaker 6:  people were like, oh, your echo is suddenly going to give away your internet

1320
01:19:14,975 --> 01:19:17,775
Speaker 6:  capacity to whoever wants to you. Oh, that's, so you need to change the thing.

1321
01:19:18,435 --> 01:19:22,375
Speaker 4:  That's true. And your ring cameras, a bunch of stuff has Sidewalk enabled

1322
01:19:22,595 --> 01:19:26,135
Speaker 4:  and the idea is that you can build stuff like Amazon has trackers like

1323
01:19:26,525 --> 01:19:30,415
Speaker 4:  tile and air tag, competitive track airing stuff. They have pet tags and

1324
01:19:30,415 --> 01:19:33,935
Speaker 4:  so you need to build this like big mesh network and you

1325
01:19:34,105 --> 01:19:37,215
Speaker 4:  would participate in it. don, don't think any of this has really come to

1326
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,855
Speaker 4:  pass, right?

1327
01:19:38,755 --> 01:19:38,975
Speaker 5:  No.

1328
01:19:38,975 --> 01:19:40,815
Speaker 4:  Like there's not a lot of Sidewalk stuff out there yet.

1329
01:19:40,815 --> 01:19:43,735
Speaker 5:  This is the first story on the list that I'm like, this doesn't really belong

1330
01:19:43,735 --> 01:19:47,695
Speaker 5:  on the biggest stories of 2023 list, which is no slate to gin.

1331
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:51,335
Speaker 5:  It's a great story. But yeah, I think Sidewalk is a longer term

1332
01:19:51,465 --> 01:19:55,175
Speaker 5:  super interesting thing. This idea of like these local mesh networks is really

1333
01:19:55,495 --> 01:19:59,375
Speaker 5:  fascinating but is not like in people's lives

1334
01:19:59,475 --> 01:19:59,855
Speaker 5:  and brands.

1335
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:03,575
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Amazon has a page that's like Amazon Sidewalk

1336
01:20:03,725 --> 01:20:06,815
Speaker 4:  gadgets on amazon.com and it's a long list of like

1337
01:20:08,075 --> 01:20:11,355
Speaker 4:  FAQ questions and what you can use and the only products you can buy are

1338
01:20:11,355 --> 01:20:11,755
Speaker 4:  bridges.

1339
01:20:12,275 --> 01:20:12,475
Speaker 5:  Oh,

1340
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:16,395
Speaker 4:  Perfect. Like you can buy echo devices and ring cameras and there's not one

1341
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:20,205
Speaker 4:  thing that you can do with it.

1342
01:20:21,035 --> 01:20:22,685
Speaker 5:  Connect all your stuff, do nothing.

1343
01:20:23,605 --> 01:20:23,725
Speaker 4:  I

1344
01:20:23,725 --> 01:20:26,925
Speaker 6:  Will say this, the coverage map is looking a lot more filled in if you click

1345
01:20:26,925 --> 01:20:30,365
Speaker 6:  to their page compared to the version that we have in here. So it's still

1346
01:20:30,365 --> 01:20:33,125
Speaker 6:  going, but they've also had an executive change for Amazon So. I don't know

1347
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:35,485
Speaker 6:  what the priority will be for this going forward. Yeah,

1348
01:20:35,505 --> 01:20:38,685
Speaker 4:  That's true. Panos pane now runs devices and services at

1349
01:20:39,105 --> 01:20:39,525
Speaker 4:  Amazon.

1350
01:20:39,525 --> 01:20:42,605
Speaker 5:  We'll see Panos free data for everybody. Let's do this. Okay, next up.

1351
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:47,245
Speaker 5:  Sony's portable PlayStation Portal launches on November 15th for 1 99.

1352
01:20:47,245 --> 01:20:50,805
Speaker 5:  99. This is the single most surprising thing to me on the list.

1353
01:20:50,985 --> 01:20:53,485
Speaker 5:  Mostly because No way the Portal is stupid.

1354
01:20:54,515 --> 01:20:57,405
Speaker 4:  Well they, nobody knows that. I know that's true. One, look, you, you've

1355
01:20:57,405 --> 01:21:01,045
Speaker 4:  done that. See you. No way. You do this for long enough. You get jaded, you

1356
01:21:01,145 --> 01:21:04,045
Speaker 4:  get, you know, you gotta, you gotta sand that off. You gotta look at this

1357
01:21:04,235 --> 01:21:07,405
Speaker 4:  with beginner's eyes, David. You're right. People are like, there's a new

1358
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:10,245
Speaker 4:  PlayStation. I'm super hype about it. And the from August it looks crazy.

1359
01:21:10,475 --> 01:21:11,645
Speaker 5:  Life was so simple in August.

1360
01:21:11,775 --> 01:21:14,965
Speaker 4:  Right? They're like, it looks crazy. It's got these weird handle

1361
01:21:15,445 --> 01:21:18,645
Speaker 4:  controllers. Like it could also be a battering. It's only

1362
01:21:18,645 --> 01:21:22,565
Speaker 4:  $199. I haven't been told about the ridiculous limitations of

1363
01:21:22,565 --> 01:21:26,445
Speaker 4:  this device yet. I understand why people clicked on this story. Yeah. 200

1364
01:21:26,475 --> 01:21:28,205
Speaker 4:  PlayStation. Yeah. On the go,

1365
01:21:28,365 --> 01:21:28,485
Speaker 5:  I

1366
01:21:28,485 --> 01:21:31,005
Speaker 4:  Can tell you. And then you're like confidently and it also only works in

1367
01:21:31,005 --> 01:21:31,245
Speaker 4:  your house.

1368
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:35,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah. How to buy the Portal not on the popular list. I'll tell you that.

1369
01:21:37,875 --> 01:21:41,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. I know. You're right. This was exciting at the moment and it

1370
01:21:41,725 --> 01:21:44,685
Speaker 5:  felt interesting. Cloud gaming was a thing people talked about all year.

1371
01:21:44,785 --> 01:21:47,645
Speaker 5:  It was like there was a lot going on. I can see it, but boyed that.

1372
01:21:47,915 --> 01:21:51,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Look, I'm, I'm, I I don't, I'm not gonna be like the, the entire media's

1373
01:21:51,405 --> 01:21:54,885
Speaker 4:  editor in chief. The, the difference between The Verge and it, everything

1374
01:21:54,885 --> 01:21:57,845
Speaker 4:  else is we're excited about technology often

1375
01:21:58,435 --> 01:22:02,085
Speaker 4:  because I've watched this cycle a million times. Right. People are gonna

1376
01:22:02,085 --> 01:22:05,725
Speaker 4:  be excited about the PlayStation Portal and like, I, I know,

1377
01:22:06,885 --> 01:22:10,685
Speaker 4:  I know, right? But I'm not gonna, we have this, we're not gonna like

1378
01:22:10,695 --> 01:22:13,565
Speaker 4:  harsh your vibe right at the beginning. Everyone else is like, this is stupid.

1379
01:22:13,565 --> 01:22:16,885
Speaker 4:  Technology's stupid. We're not gonna do that. We're here for you. We're gonna

1380
01:22:16,885 --> 01:22:18,645
Speaker 4:  talk about USBC for a full

1381
01:22:18,675 --> 01:22:18,965
Speaker 5:  Hour

1382
01:22:19,865 --> 01:22:23,485
Speaker 6:  And if you wanna carry around an LCD screen to play pss fives games on,

1383
01:22:23,935 --> 01:22:27,645
Speaker 6:  we're here for you. Yeah. I support, I, I personally support your choices,

1384
01:22:27,825 --> 01:22:30,325
Speaker 5:  But technically we're not here for you because you have to be in your house

1385
01:22:30,425 --> 01:22:34,165
Speaker 5:  and, and we have to be in our house. We can't actually be here for you.

1386
01:22:35,545 --> 01:22:36,285
Speaker 5:  Really. Sorry

1387
01:22:37,025 --> 01:22:37,405
Speaker 6:  For you.

1388
01:22:38,285 --> 01:22:41,605
Speaker 4:  I would say from far away the next one on your list is exactly the same story.

1389
01:22:41,805 --> 01:22:41,925
Speaker 4:  I

1390
01:22:41,925 --> 01:22:45,405
Speaker 5:  Was just about to say, speaking of cool promises that vastly under-delivered

1391
01:22:45,405 --> 01:22:47,205
Speaker 5:  Google announces the Pixel fold.

1392
01:22:49,285 --> 01:22:49,845
Speaker 5:  WW

1393
01:22:50,595 --> 01:22:51,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That didn't go great.

1394
01:22:52,085 --> 01:22:54,925
Speaker 5:  I wanted to love the Pixel fold. I have a Pixel fold sitting right here and

1395
01:22:54,925 --> 01:22:56,645
Speaker 5:  I still look at it and I'm like, why aren't you better?

1396
01:22:56,955 --> 01:23:00,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean I would say all of the hardware we saw,

1397
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:03,605
Speaker 4:  the Pixel tablet was also a kind of a disaster that

1398
01:23:03,605 --> 01:23:05,385
Speaker 5:  Year. Yeah, yeah.

1399
01:23:06,615 --> 01:23:10,105
Speaker 4:  Last year, I should say this past year, the the, the Pixel

1400
01:23:10,245 --> 01:23:14,165
Speaker 4:  folded. I think what people were hoping, and I'm,

1401
01:23:14,165 --> 01:23:17,965
Speaker 4:  this is just, this is a vibes based analysis, but I think what people

1402
01:23:17,965 --> 01:23:20,445
Speaker 4:  were hoping was that Google would've gotten it right in a way that Samsung

1403
01:23:20,945 --> 01:23:24,645
Speaker 4:  has not gotten it right or would be cleaner in a way that

1404
01:23:25,245 --> 01:23:28,485
Speaker 4:  a Samsung device is just a cacophony of capitalism.

1405
01:23:29,945 --> 01:23:33,845
Speaker 4:  And maybe, you know, Google's not right, but it also just like not more useful

1406
01:23:33,955 --> 01:23:35,445
Speaker 4:  than a regular Pixel phone.

1407
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:38,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's And it's expensive. Yeah. Where we landed was like, this thing

1408
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:41,685
Speaker 5:  is $1,800 and it doesn't make a particularly good case for itself.

1409
01:23:41,955 --> 01:23:45,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The thing that always amazes me is like, it's just heavy.

1410
01:23:46,425 --> 01:23:49,955
Speaker 5:  It's just a big chunky brick of a thing.

1411
01:23:51,175 --> 01:23:54,195
Speaker 5:  And I still have high hopes for the fold too. I'm not gonna lie to you.

1412
01:23:54,335 --> 01:23:58,305
Speaker 4:  And it doesn't even run decks. Yeah. Am I right? Look, if you could take

1413
01:23:58,385 --> 01:24:01,785
Speaker 4:  a go, if you could take a Pixel fold and turn it into a proper Chromebook,

1414
01:24:02,555 --> 01:24:05,865
Speaker 4:  let's talk. You know who I'm talking to. Let's talk,

1415
01:24:05,865 --> 01:24:09,505
Speaker 5:  Which brings me into my next story. I love Dex by Dan Siefert. No, I'm just

1416
01:24:09,505 --> 01:24:09,705
Speaker 5:  kidding.

1417
01:24:11,725 --> 01:24:14,905
Speaker 6:  The other problem with the Pixel fold is that it's both massively expensive

1418
01:24:14,965 --> 01:24:18,145
Speaker 6:  and several months, just a few months later, they brought out a better phone.

1419
01:24:18,255 --> 01:24:22,185
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That wasn't foldable and it was cheaper. So

1420
01:24:22,185 --> 01:24:25,345
Speaker 6:  you don't have the new hardware and the new AI capabilities in the new Pixel.

1421
01:24:26,135 --> 01:24:29,965
Speaker 6:  It's just folds. And so, so you've, you've paid all this money and you don't

1422
01:24:29,965 --> 01:24:32,525
Speaker 6:  have the best phone. It's just the wrong, the wrong mix of things. Yeah.

1423
01:24:32,645 --> 01:24:36,445
Speaker 5:  I really, I think the The Verge audience wants to love the

1424
01:24:36,445 --> 01:24:39,365
Speaker 5:  Pixel maybe more than it wants to love any other

1425
01:24:39,815 --> 01:24:43,465
Speaker 5:  individual device. Yeah. And like there's a lot to like about the Pixel,

1426
01:24:43,565 --> 01:24:46,145
Speaker 5:  but the Pixel continues to be

1427
01:24:47,455 --> 01:24:51,025
Speaker 5:  more loved than it deserves among our audience I think. And

1428
01:24:51,285 --> 01:24:53,865
Speaker 5:  by among our staff in a lot of ways. I love the Pixel

1429
01:24:54,855 --> 01:24:57,945
Speaker 5:  despite the fact that like Samsung objectively makes better Cut

1430
01:24:58,255 --> 01:25:01,145
Speaker 4:  This moment in time. Can't wait to get to the one Samsung guy on

1431
01:25:01,145 --> 01:25:01,425
Speaker 5:  This list.

1432
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:04,945
Speaker 4:  I won't give it away now, but there's only one Samsung on

1433
01:25:04,945 --> 01:25:07,745
Speaker 5:  This list. All, right? Yeah. We can keep moving. So the next one is VW beats

1434
01:25:07,745 --> 01:25:11,545
Speaker 5:  Tesla to the punch and unveils an affordable electric vehicle. This

1435
01:25:11,545 --> 01:25:15,425
Speaker 5:  was from March when VW

1436
01:25:15,425 --> 01:25:18,425
Speaker 5:  announced the the ID to all

1437
01:25:19,455 --> 01:25:21,035
Speaker 5:  one of the worst names of all time. Yeah.

1438
01:25:21,035 --> 01:25:21,395
Speaker 4:  It's not great.

1439
01:25:21,425 --> 01:25:24,235
Speaker 5:  Like when you look at a name and you think, oh that has to be a typo. I should

1440
01:25:24,235 --> 01:25:27,995
Speaker 5:  fix that. You did it bad ID Capital I,

1441
01:25:27,995 --> 01:25:31,675
Speaker 5:  capital d.space number two. Lowercase.

1442
01:25:31,915 --> 01:25:34,835
Speaker 5:  A LL dot what? That's nothing.

1443
01:25:35,385 --> 01:25:37,035
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's not great. Nothing about this is crazy,

1444
01:25:37,035 --> 01:25:40,875
Speaker 5:  Crazy. This does not belong on the list. Great headline. Exciting times.

1445
01:25:40,965 --> 01:25:42,795
Speaker 5:  Great headline does not belong on the list. Great

1446
01:25:42,955 --> 01:25:43,075
Speaker 4:  Headline.

1447
01:25:43,665 --> 01:25:44,715
Speaker 6:  Also Vaporware car.

1448
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:48,795
Speaker 5:  Yeah. VW make buttons. Yeah, that's good. But make cars.

1449
01:25:50,035 --> 01:25:52,715
Speaker 4:  I just realized there's no cyber truck wiper coverage on this list and I

1450
01:25:52,735 --> 01:25:55,515
Speaker 4:  don don't know what we're doing here guys. I gotta, we gotta go.

1451
01:25:55,995 --> 01:25:59,275
Speaker 5:  I should have mentioned I took all cyber truck, cyber truck wiper coverage

1452
01:25:59,275 --> 01:26:01,715
Speaker 5:  off because it just would've dominated the whole list. And who has the time?

1453
01:26:02,585 --> 01:26:06,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Next one. A pretty recent piece of news. Sam Altman fired as CEO of

1454
01:26:06,665 --> 01:26:10,045
Speaker 5:  OpenAI. This one I like very much because this is

1455
01:26:10,435 --> 01:26:14,245
Speaker 5:  both extremely deserving as one of the biggest stories of 2023 and

1456
01:26:15,075 --> 01:26:17,045
Speaker 5:  extremely not deserving at the same time.

1457
01:26:17,195 --> 01:26:19,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah. A story in which almost nothing happened at the end. Right.

1458
01:26:19,885 --> 01:26:23,725
Speaker 5:  But it was captivating in a way that I think no other single

1459
01:26:23,795 --> 01:26:26,845
Speaker 5:  news event in our world of 2023 was,

1460
01:26:28,175 --> 01:26:30,375
Speaker 5:  I can't think of another moment like that. This year

1461
01:26:30,855 --> 01:26:34,655
Speaker 4:  I maintain a list of tiktoks that should be PhD theses in media studies.

1462
01:26:35,015 --> 01:26:38,495
Speaker 4:  Sure. One day I'm gonna publish the entire list. And a lot of them were

1463
01:26:38,845 --> 01:26:42,255
Speaker 4:  tiktoks just like reading our stories about OpenAI drama and then

1464
01:26:42,295 --> 01:26:46,055
Speaker 4:  imposing like their own TikTok drama

1465
01:26:46,055 --> 01:26:49,935
Speaker 4:  narratives on them. Which was, it was just like I could, the thing

1466
01:26:49,935 --> 01:26:52,815
Speaker 4:  that interests me about that is like, it was a story that could be everything

1467
01:26:52,815 --> 01:26:56,375
Speaker 4:  to everyone. Like no matter what you thought or how you felt,

1468
01:26:56,795 --> 01:27:00,735
Speaker 4:  you could take this like guy got fired. Employees like guy,

1469
01:27:00,955 --> 01:27:04,785
Speaker 4:  guy comes back and you could just, it's like the hero's

1470
01:27:04,785 --> 01:27:08,745
Speaker 4:  journey man. It's like you just put any, any story you want onto that foundation.

1471
01:27:08,745 --> 01:27:11,835
Speaker 4:  Totally. And they did what hap you know what happened in there is actually

1472
01:27:11,835 --> 01:27:15,155
Speaker 4:  really meaningful, right? Like Microsoft is involved, they were taken aback.

1473
01:27:15,155 --> 01:27:18,555
Speaker 4:  There's a lot of reporting now that comes out that's like maybe Sam was lying

1474
01:27:18,555 --> 01:27:21,835
Speaker 4:  to the board, but the board couldn't point to any specific instances.

1475
01:27:22,185 --> 01:27:26,035
Speaker 4:  There's gonna be an investigation, but you're right in the moment

1476
01:27:26,035 --> 01:27:29,035
Speaker 4:  it was captivating. It was also Thanksgiving. Like literally nothing else

1477
01:27:29,095 --> 01:27:32,275
Speaker 4:  was going on. I think it's on those, I think this is one of those

1478
01:27:32,905 --> 01:27:36,515
Speaker 4:  moments when like governance of ai like

1479
01:27:36,615 --> 01:27:39,835
Speaker 4:  jumped all the way to the top of people's minds for a minute. That at least

1480
01:27:40,045 --> 01:27:43,515
Speaker 4:  means the next time we have to talk about it, everyone is

1481
01:27:43,515 --> 01:27:47,235
Speaker 4:  initiated into the vocabulary. Which is good.

1482
01:27:47,865 --> 01:27:51,675
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We like have a shared reality of AI chaos now, which is useful.

1483
01:27:51,785 --> 01:27:54,555
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The thing that struck me about this one is it's the, it's the lens

1484
01:27:54,735 --> 01:27:55,755
Speaker 6:  sanity story of the list.

1485
01:27:56,425 --> 01:27:56,955
Speaker 4:  It's both

1486
01:27:57,455 --> 01:28:00,995
Speaker 6:  The one that came completely out of nowhere. I think one of the things that,

1487
01:28:00,995 --> 01:28:04,075
Speaker 6:  that hits me when we have big stories is that when I think, oh man, we should

1488
01:28:04,075 --> 01:28:06,195
Speaker 6:  have seen that coming. We should have been more prepared or had something

1489
01:28:06,195 --> 01:28:09,355
Speaker 6:  ready. Did not see this one coming at all. Could not have seen it coming.

1490
01:28:09,355 --> 01:28:12,075
Speaker 6:  No, no. It just dropped in the middle of the day and suddenly we're reading

1491
01:28:12,075 --> 01:28:15,995
Speaker 6:  it all together and we're like, wait, he's fired. Yeah. Did that

1492
01:28:15,995 --> 01:28:19,835
Speaker 6:  just happen? It also as you mentioned happened when nothing else was happening.

1493
01:28:19,935 --> 01:28:20,555
Speaker 6:  So yeah,

1494
01:28:21,025 --> 01:28:25,005
Speaker 4:  Also for me personally working on this story with Alex e while at

1495
01:28:25,005 --> 01:28:28,765
Speaker 4:  Disney World, truly one of the most surreal, surreal

1496
01:28:28,765 --> 01:28:29,885
Speaker 4:  moments of the year and potentially

1497
01:28:29,985 --> 01:28:33,125
Speaker 5:  If they were ever gonna make a sports documentary about you and Eli, it would

1498
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:34,885
Speaker 5:  be that that weekend

1499
01:28:35,385 --> 01:28:38,125
Speaker 4:  Can, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, there are two things happen to

1500
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:41,805
Speaker 4:  me at the Outer Rim bar at the Cont Disney's Contemporary

1501
01:28:41,825 --> 01:28:42,845
Speaker 4:  Resort one,

1502
01:28:44,725 --> 01:28:47,365
Speaker 4:  I talked to Alex about the story a whole bunch, which is just weird, right?

1503
01:28:47,385 --> 01:28:51,285
Speaker 4:  My family's there, it's Disney World, like Mickey's singing or whatever Mickey's

1504
01:28:51,285 --> 01:28:54,805
Speaker 4:  doing in the restaurant. And I'm like talking about opening eye. The second

1505
01:28:54,865 --> 01:28:58,245
Speaker 4:  is I went to the bar after that conversation, I sat down and I was informed

1506
01:28:58,515 --> 01:29:02,405
Speaker 4:  that there are regulars of the Outer Rim bar at Disney's Contemporary

1507
01:29:02,405 --> 01:29:06,125
Speaker 4:  Resort. And a bunch of regulars were there to watch football and many of

1508
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:10,085
Speaker 4:  the regulars travel for hours to come to this bar.

1509
01:29:10,505 --> 01:29:13,895
Speaker 4:  And I'm like looking around. I mean it's not,

1510
01:29:14,805 --> 01:29:17,215
Speaker 4:  it's just like, you know, it's like, it's one of those hotels where the,

1511
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:21,315
Speaker 4:  the middle is like wide open and you can, you could see into

1512
01:29:21,315 --> 01:29:24,755
Speaker 4:  the brunch spot where like Mickey was singing and I was like, y'all come

1513
01:29:24,755 --> 01:29:28,155
Speaker 4:  here and like we love it here. And I was like, I need to get outta Florida.

1514
01:29:28,505 --> 01:29:29,875
Speaker 4:  Like I need to go away.

1515
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:32,595
Speaker 5:  If you stay longer than six days, you never leave.

1516
01:29:34,105 --> 01:29:35,955
Speaker 4:  It's like don don't. And there are other cities.

1517
01:29:37,505 --> 01:29:39,435
Speaker 5:  Yeah, there are other televisions people.

1518
01:29:39,975 --> 01:29:42,675
Speaker 4:  But like, keep in mind this is what was happening to me while we were doing

1519
01:29:42,675 --> 01:29:46,555
Speaker 4:  the OpenAI reporting. I'm, I'm like a dead certain, some of

1520
01:29:46,555 --> 01:29:49,795
Speaker 4:  that bled into the OpenAI reporting, like

1521
01:29:49,795 --> 01:29:52,235
Speaker 5:  Emotionally the whole thing got more chaotic over time, which feels right

1522
01:29:52,255 --> 01:29:53,395
Speaker 5:  for, for your situation. Yeah.

1523
01:29:53,715 --> 01:29:56,635
Speaker 4:  I was like, we all have to get out Florida metaphorically and literally

1524
01:29:58,225 --> 01:30:01,995
Speaker 5:  Next up on the list is FDC versus Microsoft. This is the story

1525
01:30:01,995 --> 01:30:05,955
Speaker 5:  stream that Tom Warren mostly did during the FTC versus

1526
01:30:06,275 --> 01:30:07,595
Speaker 5:  Microsoft trial. And a fun fact

1527
01:30:07,775 --> 01:30:08,635
Speaker 4:  The Activision trial,

1528
01:30:08,635 --> 01:30:09,195
Speaker 5:  What is that?

1529
01:30:09,465 --> 01:30:10,515
Speaker 4:  This is the Activision deal.

1530
01:30:10,515 --> 01:30:14,315
Speaker 5:  Yeah, the Activision trial. The fun fact about this one is that

1531
01:30:14,315 --> 01:30:18,275
Speaker 5:  this is the only story on this list for which Google was not

1532
01:30:18,415 --> 01:30:22,235
Speaker 5:  the top referrer. Basically any story that's going to like have a long

1533
01:30:22,345 --> 01:30:25,915
Speaker 5:  life on the internet ends up getting a lot of traffic from Google. 'cause

1534
01:30:25,915 --> 01:30:29,155
Speaker 5:  that's just how people find things. Google discover. Google News. Like Google

1535
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:33,115
Speaker 5:  is sort of the long tail of internet traffic. This is the only

1536
01:30:33,175 --> 01:30:37,035
Speaker 5:  one on our most popular list where the number one traffic refer

1537
01:30:37,035 --> 01:30:40,235
Speaker 5:  was The Verge dot com, which meant that people typed in The Verge dot com

1538
01:30:40,575 --> 01:30:44,475
Speaker 5:  to go find Tom's news about an Activision trial. And I

1539
01:30:44,475 --> 01:30:45,355
Speaker 5:  think that kicks ass

1540
01:30:45,705 --> 01:30:48,715
Speaker 4:  Also. I think if the year wasn't ending now

1541
01:30:49,575 --> 01:30:51,955
Speaker 4:  Sean's coverage of Google versus Epic. Yeah,

1542
01:30:51,955 --> 01:30:52,275
Speaker 5:  I think that's right.

1543
01:30:52,505 --> 01:30:55,235
Speaker 4:  Have a similar traffic curve, but it just ha it just happened towards the

1544
01:30:55,235 --> 01:30:58,235
Speaker 4:  end of the year. The Microsoft case was earlier in the year also, you know,

1545
01:30:58,235 --> 01:31:01,675
Speaker 4:  Activision is a little, this was a little sexier deal I think

1546
01:31:02,355 --> 01:31:05,955
Speaker 4:  in the court case was more was revealed. Yeah.

1547
01:31:06,355 --> 01:31:09,715
Speaker 4:  I think what one thing that I have taken away from all the trial coverage

1548
01:31:09,715 --> 01:31:12,555
Speaker 4:  this year, and it's like a lot of it, it's a little overwhelming even for

1549
01:31:12,555 --> 01:31:16,355
Speaker 4:  me and I love it, is boy, there's just a lot of backroom

1550
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:20,275
Speaker 4:  shenanigans at all these companies. We think these companies are sort of

1551
01:31:20,275 --> 01:31:23,595
Speaker 4:  like operating in the marketplace and they are not like, they are

1552
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:26,955
Speaker 4:  constantly thinking of like every possible way they can turn every single

1553
01:31:26,955 --> 01:31:30,205
Speaker 4:  deal into an advantage. And that's, you know,

1554
01:31:30,925 --> 01:31:33,805
Speaker 4:  this one, they obviously took over Activision. The FCC has appealed. We'll

1555
01:31:33,805 --> 01:31:37,365
Speaker 4:  see how that goes. But you know, I think Microsoft's people's perception

1556
01:31:37,365 --> 01:31:40,245
Speaker 4:  of Microsoft changed after you like read a bunch of their internal emails

1557
01:31:40,255 --> 01:31:41,205
Speaker 4:  about how this will happen.

1558
01:31:41,595 --> 01:31:44,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah, this was a really interesting one. I feel like this was the kind of

1559
01:31:44,405 --> 01:31:48,045
Speaker 5:  thing that just kept being interesting day after day after day after day.

1560
01:31:48,045 --> 01:31:51,445
Speaker 5:  Like so many of these trials have sort of ebbs and flows,

1561
01:31:52,025 --> 01:31:55,325
Speaker 5:  but FTC versus Microsoft was very compressed. It happened very quickly and

1562
01:31:55,485 --> 01:31:58,765
Speaker 5:  a ton of stuff happened. And we also learned that like Microsoft thinks it

1563
01:31:58,765 --> 01:32:02,445
Speaker 5:  would be cool to buy a Nintendo and it became a whole fight about Call of

1564
01:32:02,445 --> 01:32:06,325
Speaker 5:  Duty. It was just like all of the like biggest sexiest names in

1565
01:32:06,325 --> 01:32:08,925
Speaker 5:  gaming and entertainment, just yelling at each other. It was great.

1566
01:32:10,755 --> 01:32:14,245
Speaker 5:  Next up on the list, Buckle up because El Nino is almost here and it's going

1567
01:32:14,245 --> 01:32:18,085
Speaker 5:  to get hot. And maybe the best headline we published this year, NELI has

1568
01:32:18,085 --> 01:32:20,365
Speaker 5:  a theory about Buckle up headlines. Andy. Oh, it's not your theory.

1569
01:32:20,385 --> 01:32:23,405
Speaker 4:  No, it's not my theory. It's Andy Hawkins, our transportation editor. Every

1570
01:32:23,405 --> 01:32:26,925
Speaker 4:  time we run a Buckle up headline and does numbers, he just says people love

1571
01:32:26,925 --> 01:32:30,805
Speaker 4:  buckling up. Which is totally true. Like if you put

1572
01:32:30,805 --> 01:32:34,045
Speaker 4:  Buckle up in a headline, people are like, I love to Buckle up. I need to

1573
01:32:34,045 --> 01:32:37,045
Speaker 4:  know what's gonna happen. Our climate coverage does surprisingly well. I

1574
01:32:37,045 --> 01:32:40,245
Speaker 4:  think we have, we have a young audience. People love it. People like being

1575
01:32:40,245 --> 01:32:43,965
Speaker 4:  able to share the stories, like their skeptical friends and family. Generally

1576
01:32:43,965 --> 01:32:46,845
Speaker 4:  there's a sense that like this is, this coverage is talking to an audience

1577
01:32:46,845 --> 01:32:50,005
Speaker 4:  of itself, but Justine, our climate reporter, and Andy who's her editor,

1578
01:32:50,355 --> 01:32:53,525
Speaker 4:  they do a really good job of making mistakes real. And I was ha I'm happy.

1579
01:32:53,525 --> 01:32:54,125
Speaker 4:  The stories like,

1580
01:32:54,525 --> 01:32:57,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Justine does a really good job of covering climate stuff

1581
01:32:57,875 --> 01:33:01,795
Speaker 5:  like for regular people just living their lives day to day, which

1582
01:33:01,795 --> 01:33:02,075
Speaker 5:  is cool.

1583
01:33:03,785 --> 01:33:07,715
Speaker 5:  Okay, next up we have the iPhone 15 Pro and Prom max launch.

1584
01:33:08,415 --> 01:33:12,115
Speaker 5:  I'm actually surprised this was this low. Why? Just, it's the iPhone like

1585
01:33:13,575 --> 01:33:16,955
Speaker 5:  don don't know. The. Verge is like founded on the iPhone being a big deal.

1586
01:33:17,385 --> 01:33:18,235
Speaker 4:  It's an iPhone.

1587
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:23,915
Speaker 4:  That's true. Not the iPhones, smartphones. Our early days

1588
01:33:23,915 --> 01:33:26,395
Speaker 4:  were like, will this Motorola phone and it won't. No.

1589
01:33:29,505 --> 01:33:29,835
Speaker 4:  They put

1590
01:33:29,835 --> 01:33:33,795
Speaker 6:  USBC on it and, and that's, that's most of

1591
01:33:33,795 --> 01:33:34,475
Speaker 6:  what we have to say.

1592
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:37,915
Speaker 4:  I wonder if we made this list over a long enough period of time for every

1593
01:33:37,915 --> 01:33:41,635
Speaker 4:  year we could track the sort of dominance of the iPhone by how

1594
01:33:41,635 --> 01:33:45,515
Speaker 4:  high or low it is in the list. 'cause my sense is that it's trending

1595
01:33:45,515 --> 01:33:45,675
Speaker 4:  down.

1596
01:33:45,735 --> 01:33:46,795
Speaker 5:  Oh, that's interesting, right?

1597
01:33:46,825 --> 01:33:50,635
Speaker 4:  That like the new I, the newest iPhone is no longer the most important techniques

1598
01:33:50,635 --> 01:33:54,115
Speaker 4:  of the year has not, and that has been the case for a while now. There was

1599
01:33:54,115 --> 01:33:56,555
Speaker 4:  a case, there was a time when it was the most important techniques of the

1600
01:33:56,555 --> 01:33:57,035
Speaker 4:  year, the year after

1601
01:33:57,035 --> 01:33:59,835
Speaker 5:  Year. Yeah, I think that's right. It's still big. Like I think to some extent

1602
01:33:59,835 --> 01:34:03,795
Speaker 5:  it's interesting that it's the only SQL device

1603
01:34:03,935 --> 01:34:07,675
Speaker 5:  on the list. Everything else is like sort of brand new in some meaningful

1604
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:11,515
Speaker 5:  way. This is the 15th iPhone, like the Galaxy S

1605
01:34:11,515 --> 01:34:14,515
Speaker 5:  23 did not make the list. You know what I mean? The Pixel eight didn't make

1606
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:17,995
Speaker 5:  the list. No. So it's, it's definitely in a league of its own in that way.

1607
01:34:17,995 --> 01:34:21,715
Speaker 5:  But I do think it's true that I bet it it has sort of fallen down

1608
01:34:21,775 --> 01:34:25,555
Speaker 5:  the scale on Google Analytics over the last whatever, 12 years

1609
01:34:25,575 --> 01:34:26,635
Speaker 5:  of The Verge existence.

1610
01:34:27,065 --> 01:34:30,675
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The flip side of that is that people are still really interested in

1611
01:34:30,675 --> 01:34:33,995
Speaker 4:  the iPhone, which, yes, again, if you kind of look in the broader press or

1612
01:34:33,995 --> 01:34:36,515
Speaker 4:  the conventional wisdom or in the culture, there's a sense that people are

1613
01:34:36,515 --> 01:34:39,675
Speaker 4:  over it. And then we look at our list and it's like, oh, this is still very

1614
01:34:39,675 --> 01:34:42,995
Speaker 4:  high in this list. Like, yeah, being up on the verges traffic lift

1615
01:34:43,955 --> 01:34:44,795
Speaker 4:  represents a lot of traffic.

1616
01:34:44,935 --> 01:34:48,555
Speaker 5:  The the numbers on all of these are enormous, I should just say. Yeah.

1617
01:34:49,265 --> 01:34:51,595
Speaker 5:  Okay, next one. We have a couple more to do and then we'll get outta here.

1618
01:34:51,905 --> 01:34:55,795
Speaker 5:  This is Microsoft's new disc list. Xbox series X design with a lift

1619
01:34:55,795 --> 01:34:59,685
Speaker 5:  to weight controller. Richard. This was another FTC versus Microsoft thing.

1620
01:34:59,685 --> 01:35:03,165
Speaker 5:  Wasn't that there was like that run where we got accidentally a bunch of

1621
01:35:03,165 --> 01:35:03,845
Speaker 5:  cool leaks, right?

1622
01:35:04,075 --> 01:35:07,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. A document was posted, I think from Microsoft that

1623
01:35:08,045 --> 01:35:11,685
Speaker 6:  accidentally didn't redact a bunch of things in it and that revealed

1624
01:35:11,835 --> 01:35:15,285
Speaker 6:  some of their future plans. And this is what we saw, the, the

1625
01:35:15,525 --> 01:35:19,485
Speaker 6:  cylindrical Xbox series X successor that maybe we'll see someday, maybe

1626
01:35:19,485 --> 01:35:22,965
Speaker 6:  we won't, their plans for future controller. What they want for the series

1627
01:35:23,325 --> 01:35:26,965
Speaker 6:  S, what they want for Game Pass, all of these things. And this is, this is

1628
01:35:26,965 --> 01:35:29,245
Speaker 6:  the second time that we've seen these kinds of plans from Microsoft. There

1629
01:35:29,245 --> 01:35:33,125
Speaker 6:  was a Florida leads leak years ago. Oh yeah. And you know,

1630
01:35:33,125 --> 01:35:36,685
Speaker 6:  people just love these. I I I don't think there was anything that

1631
01:35:37,655 --> 01:35:41,155
Speaker 6:  absurd about the, you know, kind of revealed in these, these documents. But

1632
01:35:41,155 --> 01:35:44,515
Speaker 6:  just seeing a console that they haven't launched yet and Who knows maybe

1633
01:35:44,515 --> 01:35:45,155
Speaker 6:  they never will

1634
01:35:46,815 --> 01:35:48,035
Speaker 6:  was, was ridiculous.

1635
01:35:48,035 --> 01:35:51,975
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And Phil Spencer had to put out a statement. He was like, no,

1636
01:35:52,005 --> 01:35:55,295
Speaker 4:  this is a thing. We try everything. He was just like, he was very sad about

1637
01:35:55,295 --> 01:35:57,655
Speaker 4:  it. The thing looks cool. I will say it looks great.

1638
01:35:57,715 --> 01:36:01,495
Speaker 5:  It does. And the thing I, I continue to be very excited about the idea of

1639
01:36:01,575 --> 01:36:05,335
Speaker 5:  a console that is actually just inside of a controller and you just connect

1640
01:36:05,335 --> 01:36:07,775
Speaker 5:  the controller to a screen and you can play that way. Like that's the future.

1641
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:11,415
Speaker 5:  Give me that. Sadia was right about everything.

1642
01:36:11,755 --> 01:36:14,815
Speaker 6:  And one of the things that we learned here is that Microsoft is looking at

1643
01:36:14,815 --> 01:36:17,495
Speaker 6:  it that way too. They found, they, I think their phrase was that the controller

1644
01:36:17,495 --> 01:36:21,095
Speaker 6:  is the hero and they, they're like, oh, you know, you can plug your Xbox

1645
01:36:21,095 --> 01:36:23,055
Speaker 6:  controller into whatever and play Xbox game.

1646
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:25,095
Speaker 5:  Make it happen. Microsoft. Yeah. All. right? Last one.

1647
01:36:25,855 --> 01:36:28,415
Speaker 4:  P And Sony was like, the PSS five is weirder than ever.

1648
01:36:30,555 --> 01:36:32,095
Speaker 5:  Do you like Spider-Man, here's some.

1649
01:36:36,485 --> 01:36:40,055
Speaker 4:  This can only be, you can never put this on its side. Don't even try.

1650
01:36:40,605 --> 01:36:43,855
Speaker 6:  Weirdly no one had issues with us reporting on this one. Yeah.

1651
01:36:43,975 --> 01:36:46,335
Speaker 4:  'cause it was in the trial. I mean that's just like whatever. It's like

1652
01:36:47,035 --> 01:36:49,935
Speaker 5:  All. right? We're gonna, we have one more on the list, but first I'd like

1653
01:36:49,935 --> 01:36:53,495
Speaker 5:  to read you a handful of honorable mentions. Okay. We had stories about

1654
01:36:53,525 --> 01:36:57,295
Speaker 5:  layoffs that were huge this year. We had a story about the Steam

1655
01:36:57,295 --> 01:37:00,735
Speaker 5:  Deck that Sean wrote that was very good. Ironically, he wrote it

1656
01:37:00,915 --> 01:37:04,855
Speaker 5:  before the new Steam Deck came out. but it was a big year for the Steam Deck

1657
01:37:05,325 --> 01:37:07,295
Speaker 4:  Sean, the Steam Deck in The Verge dot com.

1658
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:08,535
Speaker 5:  It's just beautiful. Like

1659
01:37:08,535 --> 01:37:12,495
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It just all comes together. It's just, it belongs together. Just don't

1660
01:37:12,495 --> 01:37:14,055
Speaker 4:  leave. Don't touch it. Leave it alone. I

1661
01:37:14,055 --> 01:37:17,815
Speaker 5:  Agree. Josh Zos piece, Inside the AI Factory about

1662
01:37:17,815 --> 01:37:21,095
Speaker 5:  like the real human labor behind AI was hugely popular. Really, really good

1663
01:37:21,095 --> 01:37:24,975
Speaker 5:  story. Yep. It's been in a bunch of like best things of 2023 lists I've seen

1664
01:37:25,215 --> 01:37:28,855
Speaker 5:  recently. Go read that if you haven't. Chris Person's thing about modding,

1665
01:37:28,855 --> 01:37:31,215
Speaker 5:  his SodaStream was really high on the list, which kind of

1666
01:37:31,215 --> 01:37:31,855
Speaker 4:  Made me heart happy.

1667
01:37:32,615 --> 01:37:36,535
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And then Man of Chicago Lewis's very recent story about SEO

1668
01:37:36,535 --> 01:37:39,855
Speaker 5:  experts, which pissed off the whole SEO community. Thank you all for reading

1669
01:37:39,855 --> 01:37:43,655
Speaker 5:  our story. Loved that. But the last one on the list of

1670
01:37:43,995 --> 01:37:47,655
Speaker 5:  the biggest stories of 2023 and one that I think absolutely

1671
01:37:47,655 --> 01:37:51,135
Speaker 5:  deserves to be here. Samsung caught faking zoom. photos

1672
01:37:51,475 --> 01:37:52,135
Speaker 5:  of the Moon.

1673
01:37:54,005 --> 01:37:54,855
Speaker 4:  What is a photo?

1674
01:37:57,225 --> 01:37:58,605
Speaker 4:  I'm doing it. It's happening. I

1675
01:37:58,605 --> 01:37:59,525
Speaker 5:  Mean, this is it. This is the,

1676
01:37:59,635 --> 01:38:00,965
Speaker 4:  What is a photo? This is, this is proof

1677
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:04,485
Speaker 5:  Forever that we get to talk about this as much as we want.

1678
01:38:04,995 --> 01:38:08,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Here's what I'm gonna say. And I look, this is only half a joke,

1679
01:38:09,145 --> 01:38:13,085
Speaker 4:  All, right? I love Liam, our producer. But any good podcast needs

1680
01:38:13,085 --> 01:38:15,925
Speaker 4:  tension. You need to be fighting against someone who won't let you do what

1681
01:38:15,925 --> 01:38:18,445
Speaker 4:  you wanna do. And Liam is the one who says, I can't talk about what is a

1682
01:38:18,445 --> 01:38:20,125
Speaker 4:  photo for an hour and a half every week.

1683
01:38:22,665 --> 01:38:26,605
Speaker 4:  That's it. We're sticking it to the man. Every click on a, what is a photo

1684
01:38:26,605 --> 01:38:27,685
Speaker 4:  article? It's

1685
01:38:27,685 --> 01:38:28,445
Speaker 5:  A vote against Liam.

1686
01:38:30,025 --> 01:38:33,645
Speaker 4:  No, don't, Liam is wonderful. No, no, no. I'm just, I'm just joking around.

1687
01:38:33,825 --> 01:38:37,165
Speaker 4:  But you need, you need the tension. Big content's trying to hold me down.

1688
01:38:37,445 --> 01:38:40,005
Speaker 5:  I actually love this story because it is a, what is a photo story, which

1689
01:38:40,005 --> 01:38:43,765
Speaker 5:  was genuinely like an ongoing news story all year. It's, it's an AI story.

1690
01:38:44,155 --> 01:38:47,685
Speaker 5:  It's a like transparency in what we understand on the internet story. It's

1691
01:38:47,725 --> 01:38:51,045
Speaker 5:  a like, what are your gadgets supposed to do for you story? It's like, it

1692
01:38:51,045 --> 01:38:53,485
Speaker 5:  kind of has everything all in one fake photo of the Moon.

1693
01:38:53,665 --> 01:38:57,525
Speaker 4:  And also the best thing about it is it requires you to understand

1694
01:38:57,915 --> 01:39:00,685
Speaker 4:  that every photo of the Moon is the same photo of the Moon,

1695
01:39:00,685 --> 01:39:02,325
Speaker 5:  Right? Which is genuinely kind of mind bending.

1696
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:06,325
Speaker 4:  Like the thing about it that is the most interesting to me is like the stakes

1697
01:39:06,325 --> 01:39:10,165
Speaker 4:  are zero because you can never take a different photo of the

1698
01:39:10,165 --> 01:39:13,445
Speaker 4:  Moon. So like it you,

1699
01:39:14,045 --> 01:39:16,845
Speaker 4:  I could fake a photo of the Moon today by just copying in a picture of the

1700
01:39:16,845 --> 01:39:20,485
Speaker 4:  Moon and it's, I haven't lied to you because the Moon, it

1701
01:39:20,485 --> 01:39:22,005
Speaker 4:  definitely looked like that at that time.

1702
01:39:23,805 --> 01:39:26,125
Speaker 4:  I love it. Ah, let's just talk about it for another hour.

1703
01:39:26,785 --> 01:39:28,085
Speaker 5:  No, we have to go. That's my list.

1704
01:39:28,715 --> 01:39:32,565
Speaker 6:  This had been dug into in 2021. It was, it was a story

1705
01:39:32,565 --> 01:39:34,725
Speaker 6:  that came back around and we'll probably come

1706
01:39:35,155 --> 01:39:35,685
Speaker 5:  This happen before

1707
01:39:35,685 --> 01:39:35,965
Speaker 4:  This. What?

1708
01:39:35,995 --> 01:39:38,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There was a feature from 2021 where Input Magazine

1709
01:39:39,585 --> 01:39:42,725
Speaker 6:  talked about the fake detailed Moon photos and they, they kind of explained

1710
01:39:42,725 --> 01:39:46,445
Speaker 6:  it then, but they didn't explain it enough and that was why we, we had to

1711
01:39:46,645 --> 01:39:47,965
Speaker 6:  do this all over again.

1712
01:39:48,235 --> 01:39:52,105
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Then. But I will say like a lot of people

1713
01:39:52,205 --> 01:39:55,625
Speaker 4:  try to give Samsung an out, you know, be like, it's not really faking. It's

1714
01:39:55,625 --> 01:39:59,185
Speaker 4:  like, no, you don't understand. Samsung is taking the longest possible route

1715
01:39:59,685 --> 01:40:03,465
Speaker 4:  to putting a clip Art Moon in your photos. You don't need all this

1716
01:40:03,605 --> 01:40:07,465
Speaker 4:  ai. Just, just be like, it's the Moon, right? Here's a

1717
