00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,340
Speaker 1:  Welcome to the Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Stream snipers.

3
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,920
Speaker 1:  I'm your friend, David Pierce, and this is the third episode of our mini

4
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,800
Speaker 1:  series, looking at the business of being a Creator. I wanna start this

5
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,710
Speaker 1:  episode by telling you about a new nightly routine that I've developed.

6
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,280
Speaker 1:  TikTok has been the app that I look at right before bed for a

7
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,200
Speaker 1:  long time. Now, I really don't recommend this, by the way. It's really

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,050
Speaker 1:  aggressively too easy for just a quick TikTok scroll

9
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,880
Speaker 1:  to turn into like two hours of watching and me suddenly getting

10
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,580
Speaker 1:  too little sleep for no good reason. But I do it anyway. And recently,

11
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,440
Speaker 1:  the thing I found myself doing a lot is watching live streams. They show

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,080
Speaker 1:  up right in the for you feed in TikTok. And for a long time I would just

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,840
Speaker 1:  skip past them. But recently, for whatever reason, I found myself diving

14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,490
Speaker 1:  in more and more. And let me tell you, friends, TikTok Live

15
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,360
Speaker 1:  is a weird, weird place. Last night for instance, I watched

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,320
Speaker 1:  a live that was just a girl standing on a beach talking about how

17
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,000
Speaker 1:  she was going to go in the water, but not actually going in the

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,880
Speaker 1:  water for so long that all of the viewers ended up getting annoyed by

19
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,600
Speaker 1:  her and this entire process. And yet there were like

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,680
Speaker 1:  18,000 of us watching. It's

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,210
Speaker 3:  Freaking storming out here guys. It's storming out here. And I just,

22
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,040
Speaker 1:  Oh, and the best part is I'm pretty sure like 98%

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,920
Speaker 1:  sure that the live was actually just a replay of a different

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,640
Speaker 1:  live from a few days ago, which some of the viewers said they had already

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,600
Speaker 1:  seen. It was insane. I also took some notes on other lives that I've

26
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,320
Speaker 1:  found over the last few weeks. There was the one that was just a long shot

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,200
Speaker 1:  of a pier with waves crashing over it. As the guy pointing the camera

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,240
Speaker 1:  told us it was about to be destroyed. Pier

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,800
Speaker 4:  Cam video from tomorrow will be interesting for sure. You're right Taylor,

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,920
Speaker 1:  As far as I can tell, never was watched it for a long time. Anyway, there

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,600
Speaker 1:  was one where a truck driver had mounted his phone to his windshield. So

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,440
Speaker 1:  I was just watching the view of the road as he drove. I watched that one

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,240
Speaker 1:  for a long time instead of sleeping for some reason. There was

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,960
Speaker 1:  another one that was just two students in anatomy class streaming themselves,

35
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,890
Speaker 1:  eating gummy candy and blatantly not paying attention

36
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,400
Speaker 1:  in anatomy

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,260
Speaker 1:  class,

38
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,120
Speaker 6:  The,

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,040
Speaker 1:  There was one that was one of those quarter machines in a casino where you

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,950
Speaker 1:  put in a quarter and try to knock a bunch of other quarters off the ledge.

41
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,250
Speaker 1:  That one is a staple of TikTok live. You find them everywhere.

42
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,520
Speaker 7:  We got a hundred bucks right here and 50 bucks right

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,080
Speaker 1:  There. Thank you. So is the interactive sleep stream where the creator is

44
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,960
Speaker 1:  just asleep and viewers can give gifts or send messages to play

45
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,800
Speaker 1:  certain songs or make stuff happen to try to wake them up.

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,240
Speaker 8:  Viewers join my livestream and minions wake me

47
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,300
Speaker 8:  up.

48
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,080
Speaker 1:  But my favorite one so far, I think was a still shot

49
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,790
Speaker 1:  from one of those huge car crushing machines in a junkyard.

50
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,750
Speaker 1:  I spent like a full hour watching this machine, pick up cars,

51
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,650
Speaker 1:  move them over, drop them in the crusher, crush them and move on.

52
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,520
Speaker 1:  It was awesome. And then over and over

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,240
Speaker 1:  and over in my feed over weeks at a time, I kept seeing this

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,120
Speaker 1:  one guy, his screen name is

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,720
Speaker 1:  the six shooter with the number six instead of the first s. And it seems

56
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,490
Speaker 1:  like almost every night he does the same live stream. It's just him

57
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,220
Speaker 1:  in a small gym with a few basketballs, a hoop and a rebounding machine.

58
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,640
Speaker 1:  And he spends a couple of hours sometimes trying to make

59
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,320
Speaker 1:  53 pointers in a row. I found

60
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,160
Speaker 1:  myself watching this stream night after night for hours with

61
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,920
Speaker 1:  hundreds or thousands of other people. We all cheer when he gets close to

62
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,640
Speaker 1:  50. We groan when he misses someone is always

63
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,440
Speaker 1:  counting in the chat. And if I'm being honest, sometimes we all just

64
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,200
Speaker 1:  collectively root for him to miss. It's both kind of boring if

65
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,920
Speaker 1:  I'm being honest. But also totally enthralling. And Seth McCoy,

66
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,800
Speaker 1:  who is the sixth shooter himself told me, I'm not the only one who feels

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,330
Speaker 1:  that way.

68
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,160
Speaker 9:  There's people in my comments that say, I don't even like watching basketball.

69
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,720
Speaker 9:  This is just therapeutic. So it's like a, I forget what the word is, but

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,670
Speaker 9:  like a ASMR type stuff.

71
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,420
Speaker 1:  Okay, let's back up quickly. Seth is a basketball player and a good one,

72
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,280
Speaker 1:  but he only started turning, shooting into content over the last couple

73
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,750
Speaker 1:  of years.

74
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,560
Speaker 9:  During Covid is when it all kind of started picking up. We're all at home,

75
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,480
Speaker 9:  we're not doing anything. I'm, I'm, I'm bored outta my mind. And my brother

76
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,240
Speaker 9:  walks in after seeing a lethal shooter video and lethal shooters, kind

77
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,800
Speaker 9:  of somebody that I look up to and I'm, and I'm, I'm seeing what he's doing

78
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,000
Speaker 9:  and, and I want to do stuff like that cuz I think I have the same types of

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,620
Speaker 9:  skill. And, and he's like, Seth, why aren't you doing this?

80
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,000
Speaker 9:  And I'm like, I'm like, what? What? What do you, what do you mean? He's like,

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,560
Speaker 9:  dude, dude. He's like, you're better than lethal shooter. Like you need,

82
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,440
Speaker 9:  you need to be doing what, what he's doing. That day we,

83
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,290
Speaker 9:  we made my Instagram account.

84
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,040
Speaker 1:  At first, Seth tried to do trick shotty stuff, which is another

85
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,960
Speaker 1:  staple of live platforms everywhere. He was shooting threes with shoes on

86
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,330
Speaker 1:  his hands or trying to make shots with tennis balls instead of basketballs.

87
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,950
Speaker 1:  He was also posting highlights of his own games and all that was doing

88
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,920
Speaker 1:  fine. Not great, but fine. But early on he had this

89
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,040
Speaker 1:  one goal. He didn't really know what he was doing, but he wanted to get enough

90
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,420
Speaker 1:  followers to go live.

91
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,320
Speaker 9:  The goal with, with lives is you have to get to a thousand followers. I didn't

92
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,960
Speaker 9:  know what I'd do. I didn't know if I'd just sit there and talk. I didn't

93
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,560
Speaker 9:  know what I'd do on lives. I had no plan. I, I just knew, okay, a thousand

94
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,330
Speaker 9:  followers means I get to go live. And I think with

95
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,240
Speaker 9:  me, with the personality that I have, I thought, okay, well if I get

96
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,390
Speaker 9:  to go live, people will understand who I am as a person,

97
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,240
Speaker 9:  understand what I'm doing it for rather than my videos.

98
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,760
Speaker 9:  Cuz my videos, I'm just trying to get attention my lives. I, I can

99
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,000
Speaker 9:  build community.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,760
Speaker 1:  Early on he tried the sit in front of the camera and talk thing and

101
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,600
Speaker 1:  that also went okay, but talking into a camera when nobody can

102
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,280
Speaker 1:  talk back and even the chat is kind of delayed from what you're talking

103
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,840
Speaker 1:  about is just awkward. And as Seth kept telling me

104
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,760
Speaker 1:  this community feeling of the whole thing was the whole point that

105
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,590
Speaker 1:  he was after.

106
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,080
Speaker 9:  When I was younger, I told myself like, I would try to reach out to the bigger

107
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,880
Speaker 9:  pages and I would never get a response. And I told myself, if I ever had

108
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,480
Speaker 9:  a platform, I would use it to inspire. I want to inspire the younger

109
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,290
Speaker 9:  generation to love basketball as much as I do.

110
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,080
Speaker 1:  So Seth not really knowing exactly how any of this should work kept going

111
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,920
Speaker 1:  live. And he eventually started streaming some of his own basketball workouts.

112
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,800
Speaker 1:  And he had this goal, not so much for content, but just for himself. He wanted

113
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,320
Speaker 1:  to hit more than 105, three pointers in a row. Why

114
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,920
Speaker 1:  105? Because there was this super viral video of Steph

115
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Speaker 1:  Curry hitting 105 in a

116
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,640
Speaker 1:  row. And so Seth, of course was like,

117
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,340
Speaker 1:  well, maybe I can beat that. And he became obsessed with trying

118
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,020
Speaker 1:  and he started streaming all of his attempts live. Oh,

119
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,920
Speaker 1:  and about the same time, he also figured out a crucial way to make

120
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,260
Speaker 1:  his live streams work.

121
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,690
Speaker 9:  One thing I figured out is lives that are horizontal

122
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,680
Speaker 9:  do horrible. So I had to flip it to Norm Normal. If

123
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,760
Speaker 9:  you're scrolling that, that's the normal view that you see. And I did that

124
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,670
Speaker 9:  and I, and I started shooting.

125
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,400
Speaker 1:  That's when things really took off. Seth started calling his lives things

126
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Speaker 1:  like making 50 in a row and people started showing

127
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,280
Speaker 1:  up. One night I joined him, he

128
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,120
Speaker 1:  had 3,400 people watching and he told me he's getting more than a million

129
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,720
Speaker 1:  viewers a week on his lives at this point. But the question then

130
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,560
Speaker 1:  for him and really for anyone making stuff like this is so

131
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,320
Speaker 1:  what Seth has this audience, people like watching him and he

132
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,600
Speaker 1:  thinks there's a business here. But one thing he's been trying to figure

133
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,390
Speaker 1:  out is how exactly to monetize the streams himself.

134
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,740
Speaker 1:  Live is different from a lot of the ways people make and monetize content.

135
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,520
Speaker 1:  And it's a little messier. One way people have found is

136
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,400
Speaker 1:  just to basically ask viewers to give you stuff. There's things

137
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,040
Speaker 1:  like super thanks and super chat on YouTube and you can ask for tips on

138
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,250
Speaker 1:  certain platforms. And on TikTok there's gifts.

139
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,560
Speaker 9:  So I'm trying to turn around more and talk. I'm trying to, to help as many

140
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,320
Speaker 9:  people as possible. I'm playing around with the gifting now. I've done it

141
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,160
Speaker 9:  the last three lives. And you know how silly you sound when you

142
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,910
Speaker 9:  turn to the camera and say, let's get 50 donuts. Like

143
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,620
Speaker 9:  I sound so stupid. Like, I don't know, it's so silly.

144
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,140
Speaker 9:  But it all comes, comes down with with monetization.

145
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,480
Speaker 1:  The other thing he's planning is giveaways. He wants to work with brands,

146
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,420
Speaker 1:  especially basketball brands, to give away their stuff on his streams.

147
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,000
Speaker 1:  And he also started this thing called the Six Shooter Academy where you can

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,500
Speaker 1:  sign up to learn how to shoot like Seth. That's all part of the business.

149
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,240
Speaker 1:  But the thing that seems to get Seth most excited right now is all the people

150
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,080
Speaker 1:  who come on his streams and root for him to miss or comment things like

151
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,840
Speaker 1:  it's a loop when he makes too many in a row. Now Seth,

152
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,140
Speaker 1:  like any good creator, is trying to monetize the haters.

153
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,080
Speaker 9:  Now I'm trying to get my haters to, to interact. Hey, I'm trying to

154
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,040
Speaker 9:  hit 50 in a row, don't, don't join my live and don't make me miss. So

155
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,870
Speaker 9:  each gift is gonna be a sound like while I'm shooting or

156
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,840
Speaker 9:  strobe lights or just something that's a distraction to try to

157
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,550
Speaker 9:  make me miss

158
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,520
Speaker 1:  That explanation. And that combination of things actually hits a pretty broad

159
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,280
Speaker 1:  spectrum of the ways creators are monetizing their live streams. Giveaways

160
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,720
Speaker 1:  are a big one, really. Any kind of product marketing or live shopping is

161
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,680
Speaker 1:  growing in a huge way. But I think the most interesting other space is

162
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,450
Speaker 1:  this direct interaction. How do you get your fans and your haters

163
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,200
Speaker 1:  to pay for your lives indirectly or otherwise? The interactive sleep

164
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,800
Speaker 1:  idea, which Seth says was the inspiration for the sounds and strobe lights

165
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,720
Speaker 1:  that he's thinking about has big potential. I think you're gonna see that

166
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,040
Speaker 1:  lots of places. Some others have subscriptions. I don't know if you've ever

167
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,480
Speaker 1:  come across the lo-fi girl on YouTube for instance. Those are the channels

168
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,360
Speaker 1:  that stream never-ending live music that's great for studying or

169
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,110
Speaker 1:  working. It makes money through a monthly subscription that gives you loyalty

170
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,960
Speaker 1:  badges in the chat and custom emoji and some cool stuff on Discord

171
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,840
Speaker 1:  and even access to new videos ahead of time. But the most interesting

172
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,580
Speaker 1:  thing about all this is just that it like works.

173
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,520
Speaker 1:  Now Live has obviously been big

174
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,400
Speaker 1:  in gaming for a long time. Twitch got a lot of things right early on and

175
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,280
Speaker 1:  it's just fun and natural to watch someone else play video games that

176
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,080
Speaker 1:  just works. But there have been so

177
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,560
Speaker 1:  many other attempts to make other kinds of live happen through the

178
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,320
Speaker 1:  years. Remember when like Meerkat and Periscope were gonna be the next big

179
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,130
Speaker 1:  thing, but neither of those obviously turned into much of anything.

180
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,960
Speaker 1:  It felt for a lot of years that live streams were mostly just known

181
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,760
Speaker 1:  for streaming horrible things like shootings and live was

182
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,440
Speaker 1:  a content moderation problem much more than it was an actual revenue

183
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,400
Speaker 1:  stream or entertainment platform. But now YouTube Live

184
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,960
Speaker 1:  is growing fast both as a way for people to premier videos for everybody

185
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,720
Speaker 1:  at the same time and is an actual live streaming platform. Live

186
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,400
Speaker 1:  is one of the fastest growing things on TikTok and a huge business opportunity

187
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,080
Speaker 1:  for the platform. Twitch's just chatting section continues to grow. It's

188
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,740
Speaker 1:  a deeply weird and fun place to hang out on the internet. Live is a thing.

189
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,720
Speaker 1:  Now we're gonna take a break and then we're gonna get into how we

190
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,360
Speaker 1:  got to this moment and where the money really is in life.

191
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,120
Speaker 1:  We'll be right

192
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,570
Speaker 1:  back.

193
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,290
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Howley Robinson is here. Hi Hadley.

194
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,110
Speaker 11:  Hello.

195
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,040
Speaker 1:  You and I kind of divided and conquered on this particular subject.

196
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,010
Speaker 1:  Yeah, the first place we kind of sent you was to go figure out why

197
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,390
Speaker 1:  live is happening

198
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:02,250
Speaker 11:  Now. Right. So I think to, to get to where we are today, you

199
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,130
Speaker 11:  have to go back a little bit. I think webcams in the nineties are kind

200
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,010
Speaker 11:  of the starting point. Okay. Little fixed cameras that you might

201
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,410
Speaker 11:  put, I don't know, like at the top of a ski slope or there was a famous

202
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,160
Speaker 11:  one where they like just put it in front of a coffee maker.

203
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,970
Speaker 1:  I remember that.

204
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:18,850
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,090
Speaker 1:  But also the vibe of that is not that different from the stuff that people

206
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,130
Speaker 1:  do now. Like it's amazing how little has changed. That's

207
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,970
Speaker 11:  What I was about to say. Yeah. But to really get a sense of the

208
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,650
Speaker 11:  trajectory of live streaming kind of as we know it today. I talked to

209
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,810
Speaker 11:  David Craig, he's a professor at USC Annenberg School

210
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,650
Speaker 11:  of Communications. And one of his areas of expertise is creator

211
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,510
Speaker 11:  culture. He told me we really have to start around 2007.

212
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,490
Speaker 12:  The earliest precursor of what we in the West think of as live streaming

213
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,640
Speaker 12:  was launched with justin.tv.

214
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,130
Speaker 11:  Each user had channels. They were encouraged to broadcast themselves just

215
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,670
Speaker 11:  doing whatever they do. Again, sounds familiar.

216
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,410
Speaker 11:  The original Justin, he would wear a webcam on

217
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,050
Speaker 11:  his hat and he had this like B backpack laptop

218
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,970
Speaker 11:  setup and he would just stream live continuously. They called it

219
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,570
Speaker 11:  Lifecasting back then,

220
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,110
Speaker 1:  Right? It was like the kind of make your own Truman show experience.

221
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,890
Speaker 11:  Yes, yes. And Professor Craig said it was a lot

222
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,310
Speaker 11:  of almost reality TV live

223
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,870
Speaker 12:  And it didn't quite work out. And it turns out reality shows

224
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,650
Speaker 12:  are much more interesting if they are edited and

225
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,530
Speaker 12:  there's a story and people were not ready at

226
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,410
Speaker 12:  that moment to tune in and just hang out and watch people living

227
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,990
Speaker 12:  out their lives online fair.

228
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,890
Speaker 11:  But they did settle into one area that was working well and that was

229
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,690
Speaker 11:  gaming. And when they saw that was working really well, they went all in,

230
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,600
Speaker 11:  made it Twitch in 2011,

231
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,470
Speaker 12:  They quickly discovered that there was this huge community

232
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,890
Speaker 12:  and very engaged community interested in watching people

233
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,880
Speaker 12:  playing online games. And not just for the purpose of learning

234
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,460
Speaker 12:  how to play the game or watching great game play, but

235
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,880
Speaker 12:  for a means of socialization as a way to hang out. It

236
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,650
Speaker 12:  was live streaming with a purpose.

237
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,560
Speaker 11:  So Twitch blew up, it had more than 3 million users per month

238
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,520
Speaker 11:  in the first year. Amazon bought it a few years later for a billion

239
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,480
Speaker 11:  dollars. And around this time everybody's also

240
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,280
Speaker 11:  getting a smartphone video capability. Connectivity is getting

241
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,440
Speaker 11:  better and other tech companies kind of start sniffing around the live

242
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,400
Speaker 11:  space. And this is what you were mentioning before, startups like

243
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,080
Speaker 11:  Me, cat Periscope, were drawing funding. Facebook Live

244
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,540
Speaker 11:  was becoming a thing.

245
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,310
Speaker 12:  The Meca era. Yes. In the case of Meca,

246
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,040
Speaker 12:  I think it was a, a consortium of different Hollywood companies that

247
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,800
Speaker 12:  invested in this but had no idea what made live streaming different from

248
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,400
Speaker 12:  broadcast television and didn't fully appreciate and understand how

249
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,920
Speaker 12:  to navigate that. Periscope, as we know, was purchased

250
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,880
Speaker 12:  alongside with Vine by Twitter. And one of the things that Periscope

251
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,710
Speaker 12:  could not get their head around was that the creators were the

252
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,490
Speaker 12:  core value of live streaming platforms. And that meant they needed

253
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,170
Speaker 12:  to pivot to a way to promote monetize

254
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,680
Speaker 12:  support, both financially and even

255
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,480
Speaker 12:  creatively and emotionally. The work that creators were doing on

256
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,030
Speaker 12:  Periscope, Periscope was rather treated just as

257
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,920
Speaker 12:  a added value proposition on the Twitter platform and

258
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,560
Speaker 12:  has now since disappeared.

259
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,440
Speaker 11:  These apps and platforms were never really able to scale up and they pretty

260
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,070
Speaker 11:  much either failed spectacularly or faded from view

261
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,290
Speaker 11:  over time.

262
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,660
Speaker 1:  So do we think we can kind of blame Twitch

263
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,360
Speaker 1:  for that quick rise where Twitch figured out this one thing, which is like,

264
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,400
Speaker 1:  people like to play games and then everybody else saw Twitch growing and

265
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,160
Speaker 1:  selling to Amazon and said, okay, let's, let's figure this out. And

266
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,440
Speaker 1:  tried to sort of make it bigger than that before it was ready to be bigger

267
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,360
Speaker 1:  for that. Like is it, can that whole boom sort of be traced back to Twitch,

268
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,990
Speaker 1:  do you think?

269
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,970
Speaker 11:  I mean it certainly works on the timeline that way. Amazon saw value

270
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,930
Speaker 11:  in Twitch and a lot of other places started to wonder if there was value

271
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,880
Speaker 11:  in other areas. And maybe it was, they didn't understand that

272
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,720
Speaker 11:  gaming was unique at the time and there was something more to it than just

273
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,650
Speaker 11:  straight, like going live from everywhere. You know, I, I think the point

274
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,400
Speaker 11:  of not really making it work for creators back then not

275
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,600
Speaker 11:  understanding it was kind of like about them and, and that like to spend

276
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,240
Speaker 11:  all this time cuz live takes a ton of time for creators, it should

277
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,470
Speaker 11:  kind of be worth their while.

278
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,470
Speaker 1:  That makes sense.

279
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,400
Speaker 11:  Okay. But I wanna kind of bump over to Asia and particularly China

280
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Speaker 11:  at the time because live Stream was going in a different direction

281
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,900
Speaker 11:  there.

282
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,740
Speaker 11:  Livestreaming at this time in China is having a lot of success.

283
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,400
Speaker 11:  And it starts with online dating Professor Craig

284
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,210
Speaker 11:  assures me this is isn't porn, which is strictly prohibited.

285
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:49,560
Speaker 11:  So

286
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,480
Speaker 1:  This is not only fans before, only fans that we're talking about here.

287
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,490
Speaker 11:  Right? Okay. Right. You can't do that in China.

288
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,240
Speaker 12:  It was a visual representation of pretty

289
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,960
Speaker 12:  women who are able to then engage hundreds if not thousands of

290
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,880
Speaker 12:  men online through live streaming platforms to spend time with

291
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,680
Speaker 12:  them, to converse, to chat, to interact, to watch, to

292
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,520
Speaker 12:  sing, to discuss their day, to talk about

293
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,620
Speaker 12:  the world. You might use the analogy to the movie

294
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,350
Speaker 12:  her,

295
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,160
Speaker 11:  This is a little bit of a side, but there is like all this context going

296
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,280
Speaker 11:  on that like, women are moving to cities because there's a lot more economic

297
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,370
Speaker 11:  activity. A lot of the men are left behind. There's a lot of lonely people.

298
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,320
Speaker 11:  There's, everyone's got a phone basically live in

299
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,640
Speaker 11:  this context is really starting to work. And a lot of platforms there see

300
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,680
Speaker 11:  this. And every platform develops a live

301
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,530
Speaker 11:  feature

302
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,270
Speaker 11:  and soon a new thing starts happening on live. And that's

303
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,850
Speaker 11:  shopping. Hmm. It starts taking off in China around 2016.

304
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,460
Speaker 11:  And it's not just beauty products, it's also cars,

305
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,190
Speaker 11:  it's rockets. They're like selling everything in that time period in the

306
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,923
Speaker 11:  last like five or six years, it's just gotten huge. It's a 400

307
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,720
Speaker 11:  billion industry there.

308
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,110
Speaker 1:  So what does that look like? Like give me a, a sense of what like a live

309
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,150
Speaker 1:  shopping stream might look like. Is it, obviously everybody uses the sort

310
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,110
Speaker 1:  of QVC and home shopping network on the internet example

311
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,110
Speaker 1:  when they talk about this stuff. Is that kind of how it works? It's just

312
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,470
Speaker 1:  somebody being like, buy this and then there's a link on the side and you

313
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,360
Speaker 1:  can buy it and if you want it, you buy it and people do.

314
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,350
Speaker 11:  So yeah, it is a little like qvc, but it's kind of a chattier approach

315
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,710
Speaker 11:  where the host or seller answers questions about the

316
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,510
Speaker 11:  products and responds to people and it's all on

317
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,030
Speaker 11:  one app interface. So you can watch, you can ask questions and you can buy

318
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,990
Speaker 11:  the product right there. Sometimes these hosts are influencer type people

319
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,890
Speaker 11:  already who can open a channel and bring over their mass audience.

320
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,710
Speaker 11:  But sometimes companies or brands just pay their own staff or smaller

321
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,220
Speaker 11:  influencers to go live and sell these products.

322
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,880
Speaker 1:  I mean, and I guess to some extent that's not, that's a, an extension of

323
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,290
Speaker 1:  regular influencer culture, right? Like we, we've spent a long time with,

324
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,070
Speaker 1:  you know, Kim Kardashian saying, look at this shampoo, buy my shampoo. The

325
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,950
Speaker 1:  shopping stuff is just a more sort of interactive and in some ways

326
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,150
Speaker 1:  like honest version of that. So it, I guess it, it makes sense to me that

327
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,590
Speaker 1:  it's big, but honestly, what did you say, it's a 400 billion industry. That's

328
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,780
Speaker 1:  a crazy number.

329
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,670
Speaker 11:  Yeah. It's a huge, huge number. It's a number that

330
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,550
Speaker 11:  excites a lot of people in the

331
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,150
Speaker 11:  US because it seems like, I think people are, are

332
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,340
Speaker 11:  visualizing that kind of opportunity.

333
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,790
Speaker 1:  Okay. I want to come back to that. But first we need to take a break. We're

334
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,790
Speaker 1:  gonna come back in just a second and talk about live shopping coming for

335
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,490
Speaker 1:  America. We'll be right back.

336
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:18,530
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. So, Hadley China is all in on

337
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,170
Speaker 1:  live shopping. Live shopping's a huge industry and at some point, I'm assuming

338
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,570
Speaker 1:  it sounds like someone in America went, what if we did that? But for

339
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,930
Speaker 1:  America, because this is how live streaming works. Okay.

340
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,530
Speaker 11:  There are a lot of people who think live shopping or commerce could be big

341
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,330
Speaker 11:  here too, as discussed earlier, you know, social platforms like TikTok

342
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,970
Speaker 11:  are getting in the game and offering tools to creators and helping them

343
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,650
Speaker 11:  monetize. But there's also a ton of startups. One consultant I talked to

344
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,570
Speaker 11:  told me that 80% of the cold calls she was getting earlier this year were

345
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,100
Speaker 11:  from live commerce startups. Wow. One of these

346
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,750
Speaker 11:  upstart live platforms is called not,

347
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,520
Speaker 14:  You know, one way to think about it's kind of like eBay meets Twitch.

348
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,310
Speaker 11:  That's Grant LaFontaine. He's the c e o and co-founder.

349
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,290
Speaker 11:  And the first time I went Onnot, I was watching this guy

350
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,170
Speaker 11:  wheel a shopping cart through a thrift store and basically picked things

351
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:11,090
Speaker 11:  off the rack, engage interest and communicate with people there

352
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,450
Speaker 11:  who were like interested in those jerseys over there. And then I flipped

353
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,410
Speaker 11:  to another one of a guy at home selling records. I saw one of

354
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,810
Speaker 11:  people unwrapping baseball cards. I dunno if you checked it out at all,

355
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,400
Speaker 11:  David.

356
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,040
Speaker 1:  I did. So it, you told me about this right. As my parents

357
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,250
Speaker 1:  sent me a big box of my old sports

358
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,130
Speaker 1:  cards. And so I just went and checked this out and it turns

359
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,130
Speaker 1:  out it's, it's kind of addicting. Like I haven't collected sports cards in

360
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,090
Speaker 1:  a long time. I just have this big box of them and now I'm, I'm kind of

361
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,890
Speaker 1:  back in like watching people open the packs and debate what's good and what

362
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,650
Speaker 1:  isn't and trying to find like the misprints cuz the misprints are always

363
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,330
Speaker 1:  more valuable. It, I have no interest in buying any of those things, but

364
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,850
Speaker 1:  like I, I found myself spending way more time watching them than I expected

365
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,320
Speaker 1:  to.

366
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,230
Speaker 11:  They started like as an e-commerce marketplace selling collectibles.

367
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,210
Speaker 11:  The first thing was Funko Pops, which I had never heard of, but are

368
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,480
Speaker 11:  these like big-headed action figures? Collectibles.

369
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,450
Speaker 1:  I was at Target the other day and I got to watch a mom and her son negotiate

370
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,330
Speaker 1:  whether he could buy one, two or three Funko pops for like

371
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,050
Speaker 1:  20 minutes. Like I did a whole lap around Target and came back to them still

372
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,730
Speaker 1:  negotiating about Funko Pops. So like, do not underestimate the power of

373
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,290
Speaker 1:  Funko Pops.

374
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,170
Speaker 11:  No way. I mean it's, yeah, it's propelled whatnot into a

375
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,090
Speaker 11:  huge business. Grant said he and his co-founder had kind of

376
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,810
Speaker 11:  started seeing people auctioning stuff off on YouTube and Instagram with

377
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,430
Speaker 11:  these really vibrant comment sections. Hmm. And so,

378
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,200
Speaker 11:  you know, they went from just kind of being like an e-commerce

379
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,930
Speaker 11:  site that's asynchronous is the word for not

380
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,880
Speaker 11:  live into deciding like, let's try a live thing. And so

381
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,000
Speaker 11:  they launched a live product and it went pretty

382
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,840
Speaker 14:  Well. I was the first person to go live two and a half hours. I sold like

383
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,760
Speaker 14:  120 Funko pops. And so if you're a seller and you

384
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,600
Speaker 14:  can see something in two hours where you can sell 120 items, which

385
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,320
Speaker 14:  would typically take you, I don't know, a couple months on eBay.

386
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,040
Speaker 14:  That's a compelling value proposition as a seller. Then we went to Pokemon

387
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,800
Speaker 14:  cards, sports cards, comic books. There's a lot in

388
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,040
Speaker 14:  between. But kind of fast forward to today, you know, we're probably selling

389
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,920
Speaker 14:  things in about 80 plus categories. We're about 350 people.

390
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,600
Speaker 14:  We've raised about half a billion dollars in venture capital funding. Wow.

391
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,760
Speaker 1:  You weren't kidding. Don't underestimate Funko Pops indeed.

392
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,790
Speaker 1:  Goodness.

393
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,280
Speaker 11:  Yeah.

394
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,080
Speaker 1:  You see a lot of the same like, watch me open Pokemon card packs

395
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,320
Speaker 1:  on YouTube and stuff like that, but there's no sort of obvious shopping thing

396
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,160
Speaker 1:  at the end of it. It sounds like what, what not did was say you wanna make

397
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,080
Speaker 1:  this thing people like watching you open Pokemon card packs. Let's give

398
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,280
Speaker 1:  you the tools to like sell and ship this stuff at the same time. Am I understanding

399
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,830
Speaker 1:  that right?

400
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,800
Speaker 11:  Yeah, and I mean if you, if you go onto whatnot, basically there's like

401
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,600
Speaker 11:  a column on the left where you can click all the items

402
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,520
Speaker 11:  that are kind of coming up and just buy them and you know, there's

403
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,800
Speaker 11:  also a vibrant comment section. So the person who's doing the selling is

404
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,640
Speaker 11:  responding to people's questions. I see the evidence is out there that

405
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,030
Speaker 11:  people are moving a lot of product when they're live.

406
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,080
Speaker 14:  It's an incredible sales channel and that is where some of, like the data

407
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,720
Speaker 14:  from China probably holds true. Who is it on

408
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,920
Speaker 14:  Singles Day this year? I think one of the guys sold like a billion dollars

409
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,760
Speaker 14:  worth of product in 24 hours. And it's otherworldly and

410
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,440
Speaker 14:  we're not close to that anywhere close to that in the United States yet.

411
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,000
Speaker 14:  But, but still, if you're, you know, the, the like for like comparison of

412
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,800
Speaker 14:  let's take a traditional search based marketplace and

413
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,120
Speaker 14:  compare it to, you know, livestream shopping and how much product you can

414
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,960
Speaker 14:  move per hour. Livestream shopping has a huge advantage there.

415
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,880
Speaker 11:  Grant told us that some sellers on whatnot are making tens of millions of

416
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,280
Speaker 11:  dollars per year. Wow. Which kind of feels like it's moving out of the creator

417
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,070
Speaker 11:  economy and into just very big business.

418
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,090
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

419
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,600
Speaker 11:  So back to David who, you know, was telling me about the history. He kind

420
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,950
Speaker 11:  of had had this one story about live shopping.

421
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,470
Speaker 12:  I once went to a event in

422
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,960
Speaker 12:  a, a beauty store in Hong Kong in

423
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,840
Speaker 12:  2017 where the creator was

424
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,560
Speaker 12:  live streaming simultaneously across five different

425
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,440
Speaker 12:  platforms and sold out the product from the French perfume

426
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,400
Speaker 12:  company in 40 minutes. The French seller was standing

427
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,110
Speaker 12:  next to me and said, we'll never go back to traditional advertising.

428
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,000
Speaker 1:  Okay. So that just made something click in my brain, which

429
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,760
Speaker 1:  is that what this actually does is make, it makes the advertising and it

430
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,880
Speaker 1:  makes the store the same thing. Right? Like it's, this stuff has all been

431
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,520
Speaker 1:  so sort of abstracted where like you have an influencer who is like, buy

432
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,560
Speaker 1:  this thing and then you have to click a link and you have to go to a thing

433
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,560
Speaker 1:  and you have to buy it. And there's, it's often hard to connect it back to

434
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,440
Speaker 1:  the influencers. It's like the podcast ads all telling you to like, you know,

435
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,080
Speaker 1:  put slash podcasts at the end of your thing. Whereas with this, it's just

436
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,880
Speaker 1:  like there is a person you care about and a product you might like and they

437
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,480
Speaker 1:  are one and the same. And so of, of of course it's going to

438
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,960
Speaker 1:  convert better and be faster and be more fun. And like everybody has an incentive

439
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,720
Speaker 1:  to be interesting and everybody has an incentive to sell you stuff. It's

440
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,600
Speaker 1:  kind of, it's like the most efficient vehicle we've ever

441
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,440
Speaker 1:  created to just sell people things from people that they like. That's kind

442
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,920
Speaker 1:  of wild. I had never really thought about it like

443
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,240
Speaker 11:  That. Yeah. Professor Craig was kind of pointing out that like the loss

444
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,960
Speaker 11:  of the 32nd advertising spot is just huge.

445
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,360
Speaker 11:  You know, the fact that we're all, a lot of people are streaming without

446
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,160
Speaker 11:  ads nowadays. Yeah. You know, it's harder for businesses to figure out how

447
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,880
Speaker 11:  to tell you what they've got and having people go live that is

448
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,600
Speaker 11:  advertising, you know, it's just in a different format may, you know, maybe

449
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,240
Speaker 11:  in a more effective format. Totally. The other thing that seems to be key

450
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,160
Speaker 11:  to live shopping and making it work and just key to live in general, I

451
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,800
Speaker 11:  mean we were talking about this earlier with, with Twitch is community grant

452
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,640
Speaker 11:  said a lot of the sellers on whatnot develop relationships with each

453
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,900
Speaker 11:  other. When I was researching this story, I listened to this one podcast

454
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,600
Speaker 11:  and it was two guys who met on whatnot and now host this podcast

455
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,060
Speaker 11:  together.

456
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,240
Speaker 14:  You know, when I think about collectors and enthusiasts, you're often not

457
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,080
Speaker 14:  buying the item for the item's sake. You're buying the item almost as an

458
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,920
Speaker 14:  excuse to sit there and talk with people who have a similar shared

459
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,840
Speaker 14:  interest as you. You know, the, the object is almost secondary to the

460
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,920
Speaker 14:  community and an excuse to have conversation around

461
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,880
Speaker 14:  things. And so when you think about that in

462
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,320
Speaker 14:  the live shopping experience, it's not really about the object, it's about

463
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,480
Speaker 14:  the experience around it. Are you talking with someone who's knowledgeable?

464
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,320
Speaker 14:  Are there other people in there who have this have the same interest? Is

465
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,880
Speaker 14:  it fun? And

466
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,840
Speaker 11:  This is a point a lot of experts kept making to me that shopping is

467
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,790
Speaker 11:  actually a social experience for many people. Like friends go shopping together,

468
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:35,560
Speaker 11:  they try things on, they ask each other how it looks and then

469
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,320
Speaker 11:  there's this other social component which is having a sales rep help you

470
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,920
Speaker 11:  and answer questions. And so the host of a livestream and the people in

471
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,150
Speaker 11:  the chat can kind of replicate that real world experience.

472
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,920
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I, I mean that that whole idea of community is something that

473
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,560
Speaker 1:  kind of came up. I think through both of our reporting on this a lot is

474
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,510
Speaker 1:  that so much of live is about

475
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,000
Speaker 1:  like minute to minute, second to second community building. Right. And in

476
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,840
Speaker 1:  a lot of ways it's much harder than just like posting a video and responding

477
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,520
Speaker 1:  to some of the comments in the comments, which is the thing a lot of creators

478
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,440
Speaker 1:  do. But on the other hand it also feels much cooler to

479
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,360
Speaker 1:  like ask a question and have them answer it directly to you as

480
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,200
Speaker 1:  it's going. And I think live when it works, I think brings people

481
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,480
Speaker 1:  so much closer that way. And there's even a thing, like, I just think back

482
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,080
Speaker 1:  to these girls I was watching sit in anatomy class, like the thing that combined

483
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,040
Speaker 1:  us all in that chat was not, we're all interested

484
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,120
Speaker 1:  in anatomy class or whatever, right? It was just, it's a bunch of people

485
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,800
Speaker 1:  who were like bored on TikTok at the same moment and there's like something

486
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,720
Speaker 1:  connecting about that. And then if you can add Funko Pops or Pokemon

487
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,320
Speaker 1:  cards or whatever on top of that, suddenly like I will be part of, of this

488
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,360
Speaker 1:  community and we'll talk about it together and I'll buy the thing and then

489
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,800
Speaker 1:  we can talk about the thing that I bought. And that actually totally tracks

490
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,160
Speaker 1:  for me that all of this is sort of in service of that feeling of community

491
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,670
Speaker 1:  for people. That's really interesting.

492
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:56,360
Speaker 11:  Yeah. And I mean that might be what was missing, you know, in me Cat

493
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,200
Speaker 11:  and Periscope that that they didn't see that that's really like you

494
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,800
Speaker 11:  have to build a a community space. That's why people want to go there.

495
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,710
Speaker 1:  Totally.

496
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,520
Speaker 11:  I think one interesting thing that David Craig pointed out in terms of the

497
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,160
Speaker 11:  difference between China and the US is that in the US we have kind of an

498
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Speaker 11:  attachment to the retail experience.

499
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,790
Speaker 12:  China hasn't, didn't go through our 20th century

500
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,520
Speaker 12:  retail mall advertising culture that we are still

501
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,240
Speaker 12:  clinging to where we still want to keep the mom and pop shops alive or we

502
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,980
Speaker 12:  want to keep mall culture alive. They were very quick

503
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,720
Speaker 12:  and deft and adapted very quickly cuz there wasn't a lot of that

504
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,510
Speaker 12:  already to, to prevent it.

505
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,040
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like malls are dying and we're sad about it and most people in other

506
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,440
Speaker 1:  places are not sad about malls dying.

507
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,130
Speaker 11:  Right.

508
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,760
Speaker 1:  So then that makes me wonder like, are the malls so to speak, getting into

509
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,600
Speaker 1:  social shopping? Like I know this is a thing Amazon has experimented with

510
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,440
Speaker 1:  over time, but like is this the future of all of these big retail

511
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,130
Speaker 1:  companies too?

512
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,000
Speaker 11:  Oh man, this is a great segue because one thing that David Craig told

513
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,170
Speaker 11:  me is that Walmart is getting in the game.

514
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,400
Speaker 1:  Oh, well there you go. It's on now. Yeah. Okay.

515
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,320
Speaker 11:  They have set up a creator studio. You

516
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,320
Speaker 11:  can sign up, you can, you have to apply. But it seems like there's a very

517
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,840
Speaker 11:  low barrier to entry. You don't have to have any followers to start out,

518
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,360
Speaker 11:  which like, we'll see if it works. Cuz we were just talking about like,

519
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,310
Speaker 11:  like that community thing. But yeah, if you want to go and try and

520
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:21,080
Speaker 11:  sell Walmart products and take a cut, Hmm. Anybody can go and

521
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,020
Speaker 11:  try and do that.

522
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,760
Speaker 12:  All the big retailers have understood now that the future

523
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,680
Speaker 12:  of retail is in social commerce and are moving as quickly as

524
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,520
Speaker 12:  they can. Even though they aren't tech platforms, they are moving into

525
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,320
Speaker 12:  and becoming tech platforms, not just in response to Amazon, but

526
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Speaker 12:  because they understand that people are walking in, you know, they're not

527
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,130
Speaker 12:  getting the traffic back the way they once did in the stores.

528
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:47,800
Speaker 11:  They're not gonna keep having traffic in their stores. I think we're moving

529
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,520
Speaker 11:  in a one way direction and I mean, that kind of brings me to one point that

530
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,440
Speaker 11:  a lot of people brought up with live and, and why it's having more of

531
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,320
Speaker 11:  a moment now in the US and it's because of the pandemic. Sure. I

532
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,080
Speaker 11:  think you see that with six shooter, right? Like he said, he started it

533
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,720
Speaker 11:  during the pandemic, he was bored, there was nothing else to do. People

534
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,440
Speaker 11:  were trying to figure out their time and he had, there's a big audience

535
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,880
Speaker 11:  of other people who are bored and wanna watch it. Right. And then retailers

536
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,760
Speaker 11:  are starting to see the need to up the online sales game, you know, and

537
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,480
Speaker 11:  then tech companies are starting to build tools for creators to, to do it

538
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,360
Speaker 11:  all. So I don't think you can overstate like the US might have needed a

539
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,120
Speaker 11:  little push into live and the pandemic kind of, kind of helped a little

540
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,240
Speaker 11:  bit.

541
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,210
Speaker 1:  Totally. Yeah. Well, and it makes me wonder if where we're headed now

542
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:35,160
Speaker 1:  is the Walmart side of things is one version of it, right? Where you say

543
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,550
Speaker 1:  basically we have the mall and you're gonna come

544
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,320
Speaker 1:  shop it on camera and people are gonna go along with you, right? Like, you're

545
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,640
Speaker 1:  the guy you were talking about on whatnot who's literally pushing a shopping

546
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,520
Speaker 1:  cart along. That's such an interesting version of live shopping. But then

547
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,160
Speaker 1:  there's another side of it that is basically all of these platforms are just

548
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,080
Speaker 1:  gonna sort of build in like buy now tools to their stuff. And so people

549
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,840
Speaker 1:  will just go live and like, if I hold up, I have a, I have a can of

550
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,600
Speaker 1:  seltzer here and like if I hold it up on camera, it's just gonna pop up and

551
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,390
Speaker 1:  go buy this seltzer. Right. Is it all of those things, do you think like,

552
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,610
Speaker 1:  I, I guess what I'm trying to figure out is like, do we end up with a bunch

553
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,470
Speaker 1:  of, you know, like shopping

554
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,990
Speaker 1:  creators or does shopping just come to all creators?

555
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:19,080
Speaker 11:  Yeah, it's really interesting because I think, I think the other thing is

556
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,950
Speaker 11:  like a creator and a seller is not necessarily always the same thing.

557
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,780
Speaker 11:  Creators are entertainers and some of them might do sales very well,

558
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,720
Speaker 11:  but when you're, when you're just a seller, you know what I mean? When you're

559
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,400
Speaker 11:  just there to like make the sale. I don't know if that's as enticing. Yeah.

560
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,320
Speaker 11:  You know, I I, I actually was flipping, I noticed that I had Amazon's live

561
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,400
Speaker 11:  shopping app on my, on my tv and so I was like, I'm just gonna check this

562
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,720
Speaker 11:  out. And I'm like, I don't care. I don't want any of this.

563
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,570
Speaker 11:  Like, I'm not going to a live channel

564
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,510
Speaker 11:  to just like randomly shop

565
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,960
Speaker 1:  Just having a person hold a thing up and be like, here is what it looks like

566
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,880
Speaker 1:  and how it feels is something, but that's not the sort of full

567
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,920
Speaker 1:  potential of live shopping. I think like that's the thing where it's like,

568
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,430
Speaker 1:  okay, this is a person that I either I know or I trust for some reason.

569
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,440
Speaker 1:  Like that stuff feels really powerful to me. And it's like that's, that stuff

570
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,920
Speaker 1:  starts to feel different when it's like, okay, I'm now sort of shopping with

571
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,650
Speaker 1:  the help of someone I care about and trust. Not there's a hand model

572
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,960
Speaker 1:  on my phone. Right. You know what I mean? And I think I, it's gonna be interesting

573
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,920
Speaker 1:  to see if these big retailers can figure out how to get some of that

574
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,000
Speaker 1:  magic of that first thing over time. Or if all of the

575
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,840
Speaker 1:  creator platforms will just figure out how to build buy buttons and they'll

576
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,880
Speaker 1:  kind of win that race from the other direction.

577
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,930
Speaker 11:  Right.

578
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:39,280
Speaker 1:  So now that we've both spent a lot of time in this world, are you, are you

579
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,480
Speaker 1:  as obsessed with live streams as I am or live shopping in general? Have you

580
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,190
Speaker 1:  bought anything on a live stream? Be honest,

581
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,090
Speaker 11:  I have not bought anything on a live stream. No.

582
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:46,440
Speaker 1:  No.

583
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,280
Speaker 11:  Okay. I have, I have been looking at many

584
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,520
Speaker 11:  more lives than I I ever did before. Like it's just one of those things

585
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,800
Speaker 11:  I was, I feel like I was scrolling past, but there's a lot of people doing

586
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,720
Speaker 11:  interesting stuff. Yeah.

587
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,280
Speaker 1:  Yeah. This feeling like not only do I get to see somebody else's reality,

588
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,720
Speaker 1:  but in some small way shape it, I think is like

589
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,360
Speaker 1:  intoxicating to people. Yeah. Yeah. And I totally get that feeling. Even

590
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,840
Speaker 1:  just like the, this, this dumb girl I was talking about at the beginning,

591
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,430
Speaker 1:  who wouldn't go in the water. Like when she

592
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,240
Speaker 1:  eventually, like everybody got so mad at her on the stream,

593
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,360
Speaker 1:  she started being like, okay, fine. And then the stream was so proud of itself

594
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,160
Speaker 1:  for finally convincing her to do this. You're, you get to like be an avatar

595
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,840
Speaker 1:  in somebody else's world for a minute and there's something kind of amazing

596
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,280
Speaker 1:  about that.

597
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,860
Speaker 11:  Totally. I think that like, building in any kind of tension really works

598
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,720
Speaker 11:  for live streams. Is the wave gonna crash? Is she gonna

599
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,440
Speaker 11:  go in the water? Like, is he, he gonna miss all of those things? It's like

600
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,880
Speaker 11:  that's what keeps you on. Yep. You're waiting, you're there's

601
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,760
Speaker 11:  anticipation. Totally. And it takes a long time. It's real life, you know,

602
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,440
Speaker 11:  it's not edited and cut. So, and I found that watching a lot of

603
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,640
Speaker 11:  streams where I'm like, well, is he gonna actually fix the dire, I mean

604
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,040
Speaker 11:  the most Right. Mundane thing, but like, why am I still watching it, but

605
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,800
Speaker 11:  I like wanna see

606
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,640
Speaker 1:  It. Yeah. I used to think of that as, as a, as a bug of live streams that

607
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,320
Speaker 1:  it was so sort of inefficient in its use of time that it's like, if I just

608
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,760
Speaker 1:  wanna watch somebody fix the tire, like I'll just come back for the clip.

609
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,280
Speaker 1:  But no, it's actually, it feels real. It's like you, you are actually watching

610
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,600
Speaker 1:  somebody's life and this stuff takes time and there's something kind of powerful

611
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,080
Speaker 1:  about that. Totally. Just don't do it before bed. That's my

612
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,180
Speaker 11:  Takeaway. Okay. I think that's a, that's a good call. I'll need that advice.

613
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,040
Speaker 1:  All right. Well Hadley, thank you for joining me deep, deep down this

614
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,720
Speaker 1:  crazy rabbit hole of live streams. I also want you to know that as we've

615
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,280
Speaker 1:  been doing this, I did just go tonot.com and I am now watching

616
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,240
Speaker 1:  someone sell sports cards and all of a sudden I might buy one. This

617
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,240
Speaker 1:  is a real problem that I'm having. Wow. So we should go before I get, before

618
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,240
