00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,040
Speaker 4:  Neli, you made us promises about bananas. Are you here to deliver?

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,200
Speaker 5:  I made significant promises about bananas and my fellow Americans, I'm here

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,240
Speaker 5:  to say that my administration has delivered.

22
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,560
Speaker 4:  This is your white whale.

23
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,080
Speaker 5:  This is the only story I've ever wanted to do. And after we're done talking

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,880
Speaker 5:  about it, I'm gonna leave. I'm done. I'm gonna start a cafe, which

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,520
Speaker 5:  has always been a lifelong dream. But no. A couple weeks ago I

26
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,920
Speaker 5:  asked Vergecast listeners on the show that if they had actually

27
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,360
Speaker 5:  experienced the real world benefits of five G

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,560
Speaker 5:  to send us a note because the carriers themselves have not

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,360
Speaker 5:  experienced the real world money that they thought they would

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,120
Speaker 5:  make from five g. Tons of people. Sent me a video

31
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,400
Speaker 5:  of a banana in a Da Vinci robot, which is a

32
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,360
Speaker 5:  robot surgery tool and the banana is getting a raisin pulled out of it and

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,640
Speaker 5:  then the banana is getting stitched back up.

34
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,640
Speaker 4:  This video was like very popular. I think

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,840
Speaker 6:  I sent it to you

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,560
Speaker 5:  Al like it's just around, it's just a me. It's been around, it's been floating

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,520
Speaker 5:  around for like a couple years apparently with this text on it that says

38
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,720
Speaker 5:  the surgeon was in London and the banana was in California and

39
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,240
Speaker 5:  this proves five G. Well

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,320
Speaker 6:  There's like no provenance for the video or at least like the version I saw.

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,600
Speaker 6:  It was just like, here's a banana, it's five G. And I was like, who are you?

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,160
Speaker 6:  Random TikTok man. Where did this video come

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,840
Speaker 4:  From? Well, and just, just to be the one who says this out loud, who cares?

44
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,760
Speaker 4:  It's, I think one really good reason to not check on this is that is who

45
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,320
Speaker 4:  Caress. But, but this is why The Verge exists because we, well

46
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,240
Speaker 5:  Unfortunately this is my calling, it's this in a cafe.

47
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,720
Speaker 5:  So I, there are version of this video on X that have like 15 million views

48
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,960
Speaker 5:  and once that happens people just were posting it and posting it and posting

49
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,880
Speaker 5:  it. So I promised Vergecast listeners that I would blow the

50
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,520
Speaker 5:  story open. And I'm here to tell you that I did

51
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,320
Speaker 5:  and I, if you are on the Pulitzer committee, I'm available in person,

52
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,280
Speaker 5:  I'll come to you. But I talked to the surgeon

53
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,720
Speaker 5:  who operated on the banana. His name is Dr. Kai Rona. He's located in

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,480
Speaker 5:  Southern California. Let's listen to,

55
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,680
Speaker 7:  I did surgery on this banana, but it wasn't over five G.

56
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,920
Speaker 5:  There it is. Done and done. We don't do you need anymore? How did you

57
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,520
Speaker 5:  find this person? So people are lazy. Like the whole

58
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,560
Speaker 5:  story of this is media and the internet is super lazy and

59
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000
Speaker 5:  in search of views. So if you just start clicking and looking at

60
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,040
Speaker 5:  variations of the video, they all have like fake credits. And so I just started

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,520
Speaker 5:  chasing all the credits and one of them was Dr.

62
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,840
Speaker 5:  Rona's Instagram handle, but it wasn't linked. It was on Twitter. It's just

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,440
Speaker 5:  plain text, which is an incredible piece of evidence, right?

64
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,720
Speaker 5:  It's like this thing has been booted and pirated and copied so many times

65
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,680
Speaker 5:  that the credit has been survived, but it actually hasn't translated

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,640
Speaker 5:  between platforms. It jumped platforms. Yeah. So I had to take

67
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,880
Speaker 5:  the credit from X and then go search all the other platforms and you find

68
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,720
Speaker 5:  Dr. Kai and on his Instagram page there's this video and he's in the

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,480
Speaker 5:  comments of the video replying to people who are like, what an amazing

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,520
Speaker 5:  demonstration of five G technology. And he's like, this wasn't a, I don't

71
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,520
Speaker 5:  know where this came from, I don't know where this idea came from. So I sent

72
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,200
Speaker 5:  him a message on Instagram, I wrote him an email. I called his office

73
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,640
Speaker 5:  like very politely, like over several times over the course of a few days.

74
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,880
Speaker 5:  It got to the point where the woman who answered the phone, I was like, Hey,

75
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,480
Speaker 5:  it's Neli Patel. And she literally, I heard her turn to the person next to

76
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,240
Speaker 5:  her and say, it's about the banana video again. So is is this because

77
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,760
Speaker 5:  lots of people call about the banana video or because you had become so relentless

78
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,640
Speaker 5:  about the banana video because I had good reporting is about persistence.

79
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,560
Speaker 5:  It is because I had called them so many times about the banana video. Is

80
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,480
Speaker 5:  is Dr. Rona like a well-known fruit surgeon? Like what? Who, no. So

81
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,880
Speaker 5:  I, I finally, he called me, he was, I I believe at the airport he was on

82
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,200
Speaker 5:  his way to Italy on vacation. Fruit surgery pays Well, yeah, from, from what

83
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,840
Speaker 5:  I heard, it's, it's, it's lucrative. But he, he called me. He had some time

84
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,040
Speaker 5:  and he was just cracking up.

85
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,080
Speaker 7:  When I first saw that, I saw someone post my video and say to some surgeon

86
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,400
Speaker 7:  in New York performing, performing an operation on some someone in London.

87
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,560
Speaker 7:  And I was like, wait, what is this? And so I commented, I was like this is

88
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,760
Speaker 7:  not true. You know this is my video. So it, so yeah, it's false. I was, it

89
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,680
Speaker 7:  was done in Los Angeles. I mean the procedure was done in the Los Angeles.

90
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,160
Speaker 7:  The banana was in Los Angeles. So

91
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,560
Speaker 5:  The banana was in Los Angeles. I'm just telling you right now. I blew this

92
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,280
Speaker 5:  story wide open call Dr. Pulitzer right now, get him on the phone.

93
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,840
Speaker 5:  The banana was in Los Angeles sir. So this just keeps happening to him.

94
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,600
Speaker 5:  So, we post the story. This story You know itself has now has a life of its

95
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,720
Speaker 5:  own. A lot of people in our comments are like, I can't believe they did surgery

96
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,960
Speaker 5:  and had over five G just to troll me, which is great.

97
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,800
Speaker 5:  The point that I'm trying to make with this is one we were primed to

98
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,520
Speaker 5:  believe lies about five G by the five G hype industrial complex, right?

99
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,760
Speaker 5:  All of the carriers around the world insisted that five G was a race.

100
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,720
Speaker 5:  Really all that we've gotten out of it is higher network capacity in crowded

101
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,600
Speaker 5:  areas like that is more or less the shape of the

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,280
Speaker 5:  five G experience for most people. We

103
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,400
Speaker 6:  Got one more thing. We got misinformation about fruit surgery.

104
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,040
Speaker 5:  Well no, so the, because of all these promises, someone

105
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,320
Speaker 5:  who knows who was able to take this pretty familiar

106
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,080
Speaker 5:  video of a da Vinci robot doing its thing, another video of the robot doing

107
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,720
Speaker 5:  surgery on a grape went viral all by itself with no five G claims.

108
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,680
Speaker 5:  No five G, right? So they just took a banana video, they changed

109
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,400
Speaker 5:  it a little bit to make it different than the grape and then that went viral

110
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,560
Speaker 5:  on its own. And it, I'm telling you that's because we were primed to believe

111
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,520
Speaker 5:  these lies about five G. The second piece is that no one asked

112
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,880
Speaker 5:  even the video that I found that had the credit on it, like all

113
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,640
Speaker 5:  you had to do is chase that credit from X to Instagram and find

114
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,680
Speaker 5:  the surgeon saying no, this wasn't over five G. No one did that work.

115
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,800
Speaker 5:  We haven't fixed that problem at all. Right? And this is nothing, the stakes

116
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,520
Speaker 5:  of the banana getting the surgery over five G are zero. But just think about

117
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,280
Speaker 5:  how much other information like this that we are constantly exposed to that

118
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,000
Speaker 5:  no one is checking.

119
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,120
Speaker 4:  And next time just ask yourself, anytime you encounter something on the internet,

120
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,960
Speaker 4:  just ask Is the banana in Los Angeles?

121
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah, the banana is usually in Los Angeles. The

122
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,840
Speaker 4:  Banana is usually in Los Angeles.

123
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,880
Speaker 7:  I'm like turning into like a banana specialist You know. It's like my friends

124
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,520
Speaker 7:  make fun of me because they're like, oh you just operate on fruit all day.

125
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,880
Speaker 7:  That's all you do. I'm like, oh man. That was just during covid.

126
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,800
Speaker 5:  Dr. Rona was great. He was a great sport about it. So thank you to Dr. Kai

127
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,000
Speaker 5:  Rona for engaging in this silly story about the banana, especially for calling

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,480
Speaker 5:  me on vacation. That was very nice of him. He said Smart dimensions of weight

129
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,400
Speaker 5:  loss in Southern California. If you're in the market for robot surgery,

130
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,880
Speaker 5:  You know the banana survived. This is my contribution to The Vergecast this

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,880
Speaker 8:  I get that a lot

144
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,720
Speaker 4:  People say that.

145
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,680
Speaker 6:  What's your take on bananas?

146
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,160
Speaker 4:  How many times have you done surgery on a banana?

147
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,200
Speaker 8:  I guarantee no banana shakes.

148
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,720
Speaker 4:  You don't have any takes on bananas. Now I now I feel obligated to press

149
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,640
Speaker 4:  on this theory. You don't have any takes on bananas.

150
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,440
Speaker 8:  Riley's banana shakes. Yes. Bananas. No, that's good.

151
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,240
Speaker 4:  Fair enough. That's good. So, we have a lot to cover. This is like the last

152
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,960
Speaker 4:  week of summer. It's about to truly get

153
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,200
Speaker 4:  bonkers in the tech world. Like we, we have this big run of events about

154
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,160
Speaker 4:  to happen. So this was kind of a mix of leaks

155
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,480
Speaker 4:  and information about what's coming this fall plus the last of this like

156
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,080
Speaker 4:  grab bag of news we've been talking about all summer. Like get all your stuff

157
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,040
Speaker 4:  out before Apple announces the iPhone event. Because basically as soon as

158
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,800
Speaker 4:  that happens, like it is the fall and chaos rains forever. But the,

159
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,000
Speaker 4:  the first thing I wanna do is talk about some of the stuff that's coming

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,960
Speaker 4:  this fall. And before we were coming into this, I made a list of all of

161
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,800
Speaker 4:  the events of like the next six weeks and I can, I just read

162
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,160
Speaker 4:  them to you and I need you all to feel the feelings that it made me feel

163
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,400
Speaker 4:  to write this list down. Are you guys ready? Do

164
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,320
Speaker 6:  I need like a drink first?

165
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,800
Speaker 4:  You're gonna need several drinks during and after. Take a shot for every

166
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,680
Speaker 4:  time. You're gonna have to work too much in the next six weeks. Don't you'll

167
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:44,800
Speaker 6:  Die.

168
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,640
Speaker 4:  Okay, here's what we have. IFA is happening right now. The Toronto

169
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,240
Speaker 4:  International Film Festival, which is a surprisingly cool source of movies,

170
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,880
Speaker 4:  especially like smaller stuff you might not have heard of starts September 7th,

171
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,400
Speaker 4:  the Apple event where we're gonna see the iPhone 15 is on September 12th.

172
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,560
Speaker 4:  The Detroit Auto Show is on September 13th. Amazon is having an event,

173
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,400
Speaker 4:  presumably one of those where they just launched 200 things that run Alexa

174
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,640
Speaker 4:  on September 20th. The next day on the 21st. Microsoft is having an

175
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,160
Speaker 4:  event, probably some surfaces. The code conference, which we're obviously

176
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,080
Speaker 4:  a huge part of starts on September 26th. Meta Connect is on

177
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,280
Speaker 4:  September 27th. We're gonna see the Quest three. There's a Google event.

178
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,800
Speaker 4:  We're probably gonna see the Pixel eight on October 4th. And then the next

179
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,680
Speaker 4:  day on October 5th is Samsung's developer conference where I

180
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,400
Speaker 4:  assume they'll just like talk about Bixby a bunch. And that's,

181
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,360
Speaker 4:  that's just between now and the first week of October. So like for all the

182
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,680
Speaker 4:  people who write to The Vergecast email and are like, Hey, can you talk more

183
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,760
Speaker 4:  about gadgets? Like, oh boy, it's coming, it's coming. Y

184
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,240
Speaker 4:  we miss the gadgets too. And they're about to come back with a, a true

185
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,520
Speaker 4:  vengeance. Are we like, is this good? Are we excited

186
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,960
Speaker 4:  about this?

187
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,360
Speaker 6:  I'm always excited about this time of year. 'cause I, I like all the travel,

188
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,720
Speaker 6:  I like the hustle and bustle. I like how you're just moving and then like

189
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,560
Speaker 6:  Thanksgiving comes and you're like, there's just an off switch and you

190
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,080
Speaker 6:  just stop functioning for a week ideally. And that's really, really nice.

191
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,600
Speaker 6:  Like, and and you just get all these cool things to play with for

192
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,000
Speaker 6:  a month and a half. And that's fun. I like that. I like playing with all

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,040
Speaker 6:  this stuff. I wish there were more like things that I really enjoy, like

194
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,160
Speaker 6:  not phones, but I'm still excited. Like I want e-readers and

195
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,120
Speaker 6:  and weird tablets.

196
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Real lack of Cobo events this fall for Cranz. Yes.

197
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,000
Speaker 6:  Where are the Cobo events? Okay, where's the Nook event?

198
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,720
Speaker 6:  Like I, I want a Samsung event, but I just want it to be TVs and

199
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,240
Speaker 6:  speakers. That's it.

200
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,040
Speaker 4:  I'm imagining a Nook launch is just like one person at a Barnes and Noble

201
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,440
Speaker 4:  who like spots the new nook on her shelf and is like, oh look, a new nook.

202
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,880
Speaker 4:  And then the c e o just bursts out from a, a display of books and is like,

203
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,640
Speaker 4:  we made it for you

204
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,760
Speaker 6:  With like some music playing. Like the lights start changing.

205
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,560
Speaker 6:  Exactly. But they're like, if you wanna get to some snacks, they're right

206
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,000
Speaker 6:  in the back

207
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,280
Speaker 4:  At this. At the, it'd be great knockoff Starbucks that we put back there

208
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,400
Speaker 4:  in every one of our stores.

209
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,560
Speaker 4:  I don't know Richard, how do you feel about this?

210
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,000
Speaker 8:  Well and I, and I love that and I love the events, the pace of it. Not so

211
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,520
Speaker 8:  much the travel covering them from at home much better. But also

212
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,160
Speaker 8:  it's the time when all of that stuff that came out at CSS and that was announced

213
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,080
Speaker 8:  really early in the year, then you never heard about it again and companies

214
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,040
Speaker 8:  acted like they never announced it at all. When you ask them they're like,

215
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,160
Speaker 8:  like what's that? I don't, we would I would remember if you if you if we

216
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,600
Speaker 8:  had said that, but I don't now it's coming up like Samsung's like, oh yeah,

217
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,520
Speaker 8:  remember we launched 200 gaming monitors and we said they were going to be

218
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,760
Speaker 8:  released now. Now you can actually buy them. Maybe they might be at your

219
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,960
Speaker 8:  local Best Buy. So there's kind of both parts. You have these announcements

220
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,000
Speaker 8:  of products that are about to come out and will be out very soon. And you

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,400
Speaker 8:  also have these things that you've been waiting for so long that you probably

222
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,800
Speaker 8:  forgot about them, but here they are

223
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,920
Speaker 6:  And they're all monitors from Samsung. That's

224
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,680
Speaker 4:  True. The thing that precedes all of this actually is like back to school

225
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,080
Speaker 4:  season, which we've been in the throes of for like three weeks now. And that's

226
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,040
Speaker 4:  when everybody who's like selling large TVs and large computer

227
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,800
Speaker 4:  monitors and like wants to sell you a thing with gaming lights on it. Like

228
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,960
Speaker 4:  back to school season is their sweet spot. So we've, we've been in this like,

229
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,360
Speaker 4:  remember that thing you heard about at c e s space for the last few weeks?

230
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,320
Speaker 4:  And I agree it's been delightful. Samsung being like, remember that big screen

231
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,720
Speaker 4:  we told you about? Look at it. Here it is. I love it. I'm in on that.

232
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,880
Speaker 6:  You put it outside, it's great. It's bright.

233
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,600
Speaker 4:  Exactly. Okay, so we're gonna have plenty of time over the next six weeks

234
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,360
Speaker 4:  to cover all of this stuff. So we're just gonna like lightning round it for

235
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,640
Speaker 4:  now. We pulled out a bunch of stuff that's happening this fall. Let's, we

236
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,000
Speaker 4:  each picked one and we're just gonna talk about it for a little bit here

237
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,400
Speaker 4:  now, just kind of what's on our mind as a little preview as we go into the

238
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,120
Speaker 4:  fall. Richard, what'd you pick? The

239
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,680
Speaker 8:  Pixel eight. First of all, Google just can't stop leaking its own phones.

240
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,240
Speaker 8:  The Pixel eight pros showed up on Google's store website a

241
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,960
Speaker 8:  little bit early. Fortunately we didn't have to wa wonder whether or not

242
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,520
Speaker 8:  it was the Pixel eight pro or not because it had some alt text that very

243
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,680
Speaker 8:  clearly described it as the Pixel eight pro. This

244
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,840
Speaker 4:  Is definitely deliberate, right?

245
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,280
Speaker 8:  And the guy in the picture is also probably wearing a new Pixel watch. If

246
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,960
Speaker 8:  you take a look closely, it has to

247
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,720
Speaker 6:  Be deliberate. They did the alt text, like you don't mess that up.

248
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,880
Speaker 8:  It might be, but they also have a track record of doing this that's so long

249
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,480
Speaker 8:  that they might just be that incompetent. They, it's the perfect crime. What

250
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,280
Speaker 6:  If that's actually not incompetence? What if that's the plan? Like it's always

251
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,080
Speaker 6:  been the plan. So everybody's like, oh man, they're always leak. What's it

252
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,200
Speaker 6:  gonna be this time? I'll get excited this time. I don't think it's a good

253
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,080
Speaker 6:  plan, but like I think it could be the plan.

254
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,960
Speaker 4:  Was it last year with the Pixel seven that Google ended up just tweeting

255
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,440
Speaker 4:  out? Like, yeah, here it is. Like weeks ahead of the launch they were just

256
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,920
Speaker 4:  like, yeah, you've seen it enough times. Here it is. Enjoy. I think that

257
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Speaker 4:  was last year. Pretty funny. I

258
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,040
Speaker 8:  Can't, I can't remember if that was the seven or the seven eight, but I I

259
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,040
Speaker 8:  think you're right. That was the seven. They were just like, yeah, look,

260
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,800
Speaker 8:  You know what it is.

261
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,800
Speaker 4:  I feel like it looks like the last one. Whatever

262
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,800
Speaker 8:  The, the bad news unfortunately this week about the Pixel is You know if

263
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,320
Speaker 8:  you bought a Pixel six and you subscribed to Pixel Pass like I did,

264
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,920
Speaker 8:  thinking that you'd be able to easily upgrade because Google said you would

265
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,480
Speaker 8:  be able to, they said you would, you won't, you couldn't upgrade for two

266
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,560
Speaker 8:  years. It was locked. You would have to wait two years to upgrade to a new

267
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,520
Speaker 8:  device. It is now one year in about 10 and a half months and

268
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,800
Speaker 8:  Google says, yeah, we're not doing that anymore. The Pixel pass is over.

269
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,480
Speaker 6:  Do you feel bait and switched?

270
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,320
Speaker 8:  I feel bait and something I don't know switched. Exactly. Yeah,

271
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,080
Speaker 6:  Because before this, like before we started recording, you were like, I'm

272
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,680
Speaker 6:  not that upset about it, but you're like, walk me through that. Why aren't

273
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,160
Speaker 6:  you that upset about it?

274
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,560
Speaker 8:  Well, there's kind of two parts to it. What, what people paid for? What,

275
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,440
Speaker 8:  what I paid for? I got, I bought a phone, okay. That I paid for over the

276
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,960
Speaker 8:  course of several months. Also paid a, a kind of bundled discounted price

277
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,400
Speaker 8:  for a bunch of services like cloud storage that I don't really use YouTube

278
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,600
Speaker 8:  music that I do use a YouTube premium. It's pretty nice to forget that YouTube

279
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,560
Speaker 8:  has ads, got all that and even after the Pixel pass goes away,

280
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,520
Speaker 8:  they'll still have a discounted rate for those services and also insurance

281
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,640
Speaker 8:  for the phone and stuff like that. Like it, it was all in one thing. Sweet.

282
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,000
Speaker 8:  But when they announced it, they said that it was going to give you

283
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,640
Speaker 8:  easy device upgrades and you could do it after two years and now

284
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,320
Speaker 8:  no one will get that. Like, it's not even like they're cutting it off. And

285
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,280
Speaker 8:  some people took advantage, some people didn't zero. There there is zero

286
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,520
Speaker 8:  of that, which you can still get like a, a 0% a p r phone if

287
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,280
Speaker 8:  you want to get it like, and, and pay it over the course of months or something.

288
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,840
Speaker 8:  But you just can't do this package again. I

289
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,040
Speaker 4:  Think you're way underselling this. I think this is outrageous. Like I honestly

290
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,960
Speaker 4:  believe this is one of the like crueler

291
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,040
Speaker 4:  and more cynical things Google has done in a series of cruel

292
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,800
Speaker 4:  and cynical things to people who bought its products and cared about them.

293
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,080
Speaker 4:  A and they framed this in, in the course of building up the Pixel over the

294
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,960
Speaker 4:  years as like another way to believe that Google is gonna continue to care

295
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,400
Speaker 4:  about its hardware, right? Like it has said over and over for years now.

296
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,240
Speaker 4:  Like, we are in this for real. We are gonna take care of customers, we're

297
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,320
Speaker 4:  gonna keep giving you reasons to be part of this. We're gonna keep making

298
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,720
Speaker 4:  the deals better on and on and on. And this is like the most

299
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,480
Speaker 4:  deliberate shitty rug pull of a move. I can imagine. Even if

300
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,360
Speaker 4:  everyone more or less like you're saying comes out of it whole, which I actually

301
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,960
Speaker 4:  don't really think is true because I think there are a lot of people who

302
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,760
Speaker 4:  are now gonna go through much more messy and complicated upgrade

303
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,400
Speaker 4:  programs than it would've been if I could have just clicked a button and

304
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,560
Speaker 4:  shipped my thing to Google and gotten a new phone. Like that's a win in a

305
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,320
Speaker 4:  way that like, even if I have to go to my carrier store and do a trade-in

306
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,120
Speaker 4:  is more complicated. So even just making it harder is a, is a loss.

307
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,120
Speaker 4:  But I just think like from a pure, like showing people you

308
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,720
Speaker 4:  don't care about the move, this is such a crappy thing for Google to do

309
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,040
Speaker 8:  And, and the people who are the most dedicated to the brand, like yeah pro

310
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,400
Speaker 8:  probably the biggest Pixel fans who are like, okay, yeah, I'll get one and

311
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,600
Speaker 8:  then two years from now I'll get another one. I I'm willing to sign up. Si

312
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,680
Speaker 8:  let me do it. I

313
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,680
Speaker 6:  Think it's a mischaracterization to call you guys the biggest Pixel fans,

314
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,720
Speaker 6:  I think just Pixel fans, right?

315
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,920
Speaker 8:  Who's a bigger Pixel fan?

316
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,200
Speaker 6:  No, but like

317
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,880
Speaker 8:  I'll fight them.

318
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,120
Speaker 6:  Are there people that, is there anything above a Pixel fan? I think like

319
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,280
Speaker 6:  Pix being a Pixel fan in itself makes you a big Pixel fan.

320
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,520
Speaker 4:  So you're saying like there is no such thing as a small Pixel fan. There's

321
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,320
Speaker 8:  Not like a Zoom tattoo guy of the Pixel community. Yeah,

322
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,160
Speaker 6:  There's no such thing as a small Pixel fan. Like you have to have passion.

323
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,760
Speaker 4:  There are no small Pixel fans, only small people. Like

324
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,720
Speaker 6:  There's, it's like E Inc. There's no such thing as a small E

325
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,920
Speaker 6:  Ink fan. Like you could be like, oh that's a, like I'm not a big Ein fan,

326
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,840
Speaker 6:  I'm an E Ink fan because there's not a lot of us. There's not enough of

327
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,200
Speaker 6:  us for there to be like big ones and little ones

328
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,400
Speaker 8:  Now You know what, I think there are kind of Pixel casuals, okay, as it were.

329
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,880
Speaker 8:  And, and many of them may have picked up the Pixel Pass be because again

330
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,160
Speaker 8:  it was, it was a pretty good deal and a decent way to buy a phone. It was

331
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,320
Speaker 8:  like, oh, You know you can click a button and you can get all the things

332
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,560
Speaker 8:  in in one thing, not your carrier. You can go bring that how you want or

333
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,400
Speaker 8:  you could get Google Fi and get another $5 off. But now those people are

334
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,120
Speaker 8:  just, oh, not happening. I think it's

335
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,080
Speaker 6:  Just like, was just super, I don't know. I am, I'm, I know you're

336
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,160
Speaker 6:  processing it and I know you're in a place where you're like, it's fine,

337
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,240
Speaker 6:  it's chill. But I really hope like next week we come

338
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,160
Speaker 6:  back and we're like, Richard, how are you feeling about it? I hope you're

339
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,000
Speaker 6:  like mad 'cause I'm so mad on your behalf. I'm just like, they

340
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,560
Speaker 6:  like, I'm with David, I'm like, they they bait and switched y'all. They were

341
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,360
Speaker 6:  like, Hey come and do this Nas psych we're, we don't give a crap about you

342
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,840
Speaker 6:  guys. We're not even gonna last two years. Like it feels like

343
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,240
Speaker 6:  disingenuous marketing. It just feels gross and I'm

344
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,800
Speaker 6:  sad for you.

345
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,720
Speaker 8:  Yeah, but believing that Google would actually come through on something

346
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,520
Speaker 8:  that they promised is basically doing it to yourself. That's

347
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,640
Speaker 8:  like I, I've, I've got to take the l on that one. I I just, that should've,

348
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,000
Speaker 8:  should've seen that coming that, that that was, that was not a 5,000 IQ plus.

349
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,360
Speaker 8:  It

350
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,760
Speaker 4:  Really, it really is like terrifying how true that it's like I, I wrote,

351
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,720
Speaker 4:  I wrote a thing, I think it was last week about Google Keep their note taking

352
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,960
Speaker 4:  app, which has gotten a couple of like really nice upgrades. It's a good

353
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,920
Speaker 4:  app. It's kind of a thing people don't like know or use, but the people

354
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,120
Speaker 4:  who do really love it 'cause it's a really good simple note taking app. And

355
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,360
Speaker 4:  like overwhelmingly the comments on the story were like, don't talk about

356
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,120
Speaker 4:  ke Google will remember it exists and kill it. Like if an, if a Google

357
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,600
Speaker 4:  executive reads this, the one engineer who is still building features will

358
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,680
Speaker 4:  get fired and they'll kill this app. And it's like that's how people think

359
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,560
Speaker 4:  about this stuff. Like we literally cannot have nice things from Google anymore

360
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,280
Speaker 4:  because it just ruthlessly kills all of them. And I think

361
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,800
Speaker 4:  if I am the hardware team, they're still in this position of people

362
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,440
Speaker 4:  don't believe them, that they're serious and with, with good reason and lots

363
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,160
Speaker 4:  of evidence. And so like if I was Google, I would've gone way

364
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,160
Speaker 4:  out of my way to say this thing is going to continue to exist where if

365
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,560
Speaker 4:  we, even if we can't think of a way to make it worthwhile for the people

366
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,080
Speaker 4:  who already got it, even if they've already been made whole, we're gonna

367
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,800
Speaker 4:  come up with something new because what we need you to do is be loyal to

368
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,640
Speaker 4:  us and trust that we're gonna be loyal to you. And instead they're just like,

369
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,120
Speaker 4:  nevermind you get YouTube.

370
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,880
Speaker 6:  How, how do they, how can, like I feel like I had this exact conversation

371
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,120
Speaker 6:  two years ago with Dieter on The Vergecast about like when, when

372
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,680
Speaker 6:  that Pixel six came out. 'cause that was the big moment where, where that

373
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,480
Speaker 6:  was what the fourth iteration of, no, we really

374
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,160
Speaker 6:  care about hardware now. This is the moment. And we're like, okay.

375
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,800
Speaker 6:  And they did the Pixel Pass and it's like, okay, they feel like they, and

376
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,040
Speaker 6:  then they, they pulled the rug again. So it's like how do you build that

377
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,000
Speaker 6:  trust? You keep like destroying that trust every

378
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,920
Speaker 6:  time you get a little bit of it, you go and you like poop on it and say,

379
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,280
Speaker 6:  oh Pixel fans, the 12 of you that exist, including Richard,

380
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,080
Speaker 6:  get outta here. We don't like you. I just don't see how they, can they come

381
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,800
Speaker 6:  back from this?

382
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,480
Speaker 8:  Well I think the, I think the writing really was on the wall because when

383
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,080
Speaker 8:  you look at like when the Pixel fold came out and people asked about the

384
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,520
Speaker 8:  Pixel Pass, they were told basically the same language that they, they announced

385
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,400
Speaker 8:  this week that yeah, no, not so much happening. And

386
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,080
Speaker 8:  and I think that's part of what makes it worse is that they could have announced

387
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,760
Speaker 8:  this six months ago. Yeah. But people were like, oh, people were sitting

388
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,080
Speaker 8:  back. They saw, they said they saw the rumors. They were like, oh, Pixel

389
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,960
Speaker 8:  eight is coming out. I'll, I'll just be able to get that check. No, no,

390
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,720
Speaker 8:  you will not. You

391
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,880
Speaker 6:  Have felt better if they'd done it six months ago if they just like So you

392
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
Speaker 6:  could have like prepared emotionally.

393
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,960
Speaker 8:  Yes. Emotionally, yes.

394
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,960
Speaker 4:  Alright, let's, let's move on. We're gonna have a lot of time to yell at

395
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,760
Speaker 4:  Google between now and October. Do we know anything about the eight Pro yet?

396
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,760
Speaker 4:  By the way, Richard, is there any, we saw the one picture in the ad. Are

397
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,600
Speaker 4:  there like reputable rumors?

398
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,200
Speaker 8:  Yes, we've seen lots of pictures. We've seen renders, we've seen specs.

399
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,960
Speaker 8:  There's rumors that it'll have wifi seven, it'll probably still have the

400
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,800
Speaker 8:  same. The F c C filings came out this week. Also So, we know that

401
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,360
Speaker 8:  it's basically like the previous ones where like the pro has ultra

402
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,040
Speaker 8:  wideband, but the regular one does not. We've seen

403
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,680
Speaker 8:  kind of hardware specs about the chips. It's a Pixel. Okay. You, you You

404
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,600
Speaker 8:  know how these go. The, the real question is like what are the software features

405
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,800
Speaker 8:  going to be? And there's been leaks of something like video unblur. So just

406
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,200
Speaker 8:  like photo unblur. But for videos

407
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,120
Speaker 4:  That's cool. I just wanna say I was out sick for the last two days and somehow

408
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,920
Speaker 4:  wifi seven happened while I was gone for two days. So that's cool

409
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,280
Speaker 4:  and fun and I'll catch up on that over here. But I do think

410
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,520
Speaker 4:  I'm actually more interested in the Pixel than the iPhone this year because

411
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,960
Speaker 4:  like Google has been saying this thing about like on-device AI for You know

412
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,840
Speaker 4:  years now. And this seems like one of the first years that

413
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,560
Speaker 4:  if it wants to do some like really genuinely wild on-device AI stuff,

414
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,840
Speaker 4:  it might actually be able to. So I think that's gonna be very interesting.

415
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,960
Speaker 4:  But again, we have lots of time to talk about that. I'm gonna go next 'cause

416
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,480
Speaker 4:  I wanna talk about Taylor Swift and Cranz. You can go last. Okay. The true

417
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,960
Speaker 4:  events of the fall I think we can agree is that Taylor

418
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,040
Speaker 4:  Swift's Eras tour is coming to a m c theaters across the

419
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,800
Speaker 4:  country in October. As far as I know, at least from what I've seen so far,

420
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,880
Speaker 4:  this is all kind of just happening. We don't know for how long. We

421
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,520
Speaker 4:  just know that they're doing at least four showings a day at every theater.

422
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,600
Speaker 4:  And that a m c has upgraded its ticket capabilities for five times

423
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,600
Speaker 4:  as much demand as it has had before because of all the Swifties

424
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,760
Speaker 4:  who did or did not get tickets to the Aris tour. I honestly believe this

425
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,360
Speaker 4:  might be like the biggest movie of all time if it was allowed to be.

426
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,320
Speaker 6:  It's a like concert movie, right? It's it's not live streams.

427
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So from just like the little tiny bits I've seen, you can see some

428
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,240
Speaker 4:  snippets on like Taylor Swift's TikTok account was I think where I saw it.

429
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,680
Speaker 4:  It looks basically like a super well produced concert film.

430
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,200
Speaker 6:  I love that. That sounds great.

431
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,440
Speaker 4:  It sounds amazing. And you'll get to see it in like a gigantic theater with

432
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,920
Speaker 4:  You know cool surround sound and it'll be a million swifties like they even

433
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,560
Speaker 4:  said bring the friendship bracelets dress in all the Eras stuff. Like you

434
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,200
Speaker 4:  better believe I will be there giving people bracelets that say

435
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,160
Speaker 4:  Verge Swifties and we can all be Verge swifties together. I

436
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,640
Speaker 6:  I won't be there but I will support all of you. Are there Verge, Swifties

437
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,120
Speaker 6:  Swifties besides you and Neli?

438
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,680
Speaker 4:  I think sneakily like two thirds of The Verge is Swifties. I

439
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,160
Speaker 4:  know at least a couple of people tried and failed multiple times to get Eras

440
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,520
Speaker 4:  tickets. Richard is being suspiciously quiet, which makes me think he's definitely

441
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,240
Speaker 4:  a swifty for sure.

442
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,560
Speaker 6:  I was like, hmm, look at Richard's off looking in a corner. Richard.

443
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,040
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I just don't know what's going on here.

444
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,680
Speaker 8:  I'm very happy for you

445
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,840
Speaker 4:  Though. The cultural event of the summer and fall and winter

446
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,200
Speaker 4:  and the rest of our lives. I'm sure this movie might be in theaters for a

447
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,880
Speaker 4:  decade. Richard,

448
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,080
Speaker 6:  She, she fixed the economy. Like, like they keep being like, oh yeah, the,

449
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,600
Speaker 6:  the Eras to her increased spending, like it fixed the economy.

450
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,560
Speaker 6:  I don't think it fixed the economy, but it increased spending. What if she

451
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,680
Speaker 6:  like lowers the rent? What if she, what if she like

452
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,960
Speaker 6:  changes the world with this tour? I fully believe in her, her

453
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,040
Speaker 6:  economic prowess. Oh,

454
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,920
Speaker 4:  I agree. At some point when the, when the era's tour ends, we're going to

455
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,000
Speaker 4:  find somebody fun to talk to about this and we're gonna go through like the

456
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,680
Speaker 4:  insane like stratospheric records that this

457
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:24,160
Speaker 4:  tour has set and nothing will ever top it ever again. And

458
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,680
Speaker 4:  like the things she has, it's insane and wild and I'm very excited about

459
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,240
Speaker 4:  this movie. And that's all everybody, you probably can't get tickets if you're

460
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,520
Speaker 4:  hearing this now. Well it created

461
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,320
Speaker 8:  Congressional hearings about Ticketmaster.

462
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,320
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah, well yeah, yeah. She broke Ticketmaster. She's gonna make a m c

463
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,200
Speaker 4:  the most valuable company in the universe now. This is, she runs

464
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,680
Speaker 4:  the economy. This is what it is. Alright, Cranz, you're up. What do you got?

465
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,920
Speaker 6:  Okay, iPhone's coming two weeks. I'm really mad. I bought

466
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,840
Speaker 6:  an iPhone 14 pro last year and I was really excited about it and I was like,

467
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,480
Speaker 6:  I'll be fine. I don't need the next one. And now the next sounds like it's

468
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,000
Speaker 6:  almost definitely gonna have USB C and the FOMO

469
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,480
Speaker 6:  is extreme for me at the moment and like I'm, I'm locked into

470
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,840
Speaker 6:  this payment plan for another year. So it's not like I'm not, I'm I'm cheap,

471
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,600
Speaker 6:  I'm not gonna be going and buying it, but I'm gonna be regretting my life

472
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,040
Speaker 6:  choices a lot. Like come two weeks from now,

473
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,920
Speaker 4:  You didn't get the iPhone upgrade plan.

474
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,360
Speaker 6:  No, I wanna pay in cash because it didn't work with my Apple Pay

475
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,840
Speaker 6:  card, I think. And I want my, I want my 3%.

476
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,480
Speaker 4:  I like imagining that you just walk in with a bag of nickels and just like

477
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,280
Speaker 4:  throw it on the desk in the Apple store and you're like, gimme an iPhone.

478
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,800
Speaker 6:  I just whip it across the, the genius bar at 'em. Yeah, but

479
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,960
Speaker 6:  it it seems exciting. I, I don't know. Does iPhones are

480
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,120
Speaker 6:  kind of weird in a weird place, right? Like they yeah, they're in a weird

481
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,000
Speaker 6:  place. Last year the exciting thing was the dynamic island and we, we enjoyed

482
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,760
Speaker 6:  the island, but try explaining to anyone who doesn't listen to The

483
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,720
Speaker 6:  Vergecast what the Dynamic Island is. And that's a less fun

484
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,560
Speaker 6:  conversation.

485
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They'll just say it's that thing at the top of the screen that screws

486
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,280
Speaker 4:  up all the apps sometimes. Yeah,

487
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,160
Speaker 6:  The, they're just kind of annoyed with you. But like USB c i

488
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,280
Speaker 6:  I'm su like beyond excited about USB C I just got a new USB

489
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,080
Speaker 6:  C charger from from Anker and I'm so like it

490
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,760
Speaker 6:  charges my phone or not my phone. It charges like my, my

491
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,040
Speaker 6:  computer, it charges my Steam Deck, it charges

492
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:19,640
Speaker 6:  just everything I own that I can plug USB C into and it's

493
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,680
Speaker 6:  wonderful and I'm like, oh I want my phone to do that too.

494
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,360
Speaker 6:  That seems cool.

495
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,640
Speaker 6:  So USB C alone has, has been pumped for it and we're getting USB C on the

496
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,600
Speaker 6:  AirPod case. I'm not gonna buy it because again, like if my phone

497
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,280
Speaker 6:  doesn't do USB c I refuse to let my AirPods case do USB C

498
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,560
Speaker 6:  it has to wait in line. But this is like exciting. If you like

499
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,560
Speaker 6:  USB C it's gonna be a big event. If you like anything else, it's gonna

500
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,320
Speaker 6:  be an iPhone event.

501
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,840
Speaker 8:  Well also if you like wireless charging, I mean we'll talk to John in a bit,

502
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,720
Speaker 8:  but the big news at IFA is these wireless chargers that are getting announced

503
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,440
Speaker 8:  with the Q two standard that the iPhone 15 may

504
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,360
Speaker 8:  support. We'll I guess we'll find out and allow kind of non MagSafe

505
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,840
Speaker 8:  chargers to charge iPhones at the same rate as MagSafe and also You know

506
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,240
Speaker 8:  kind of other devices, other phones that support 15 watt wireless charging.

507
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,240
Speaker 8:  So if you like wireless charging, this is your moment. Oh, I

508
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,320
Speaker 6:  Got a wireless charger too. I spent like $150 or,

509
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,120
Speaker 8:  Or if you wanna buy a new charging stand or something like that. Yeah, don't

510
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,840
Speaker 8:  for like the next couple

511
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,680
Speaker 6:  Times don't, don't be me, I bought it last month. I do not read our website

512
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,480
Speaker 6:  enough is what happened there.

513
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,320
Speaker 6:  A lot of regret.

514
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,920
Speaker 4:  I was talking to somebody at one of the charging companies the other day

515
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,680
Speaker 4:  and, and they were basically saying that the USB C thing is cool

516
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,680
Speaker 4:  but it's a mirage because wireless is the real thing that it's like the actual

517
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,480
Speaker 4:  arc that we're on is wireless charging taking over. And

518
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,280
Speaker 4:  it would've been great if USB C had been ready You know 12 years ago and

519
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,040
Speaker 4:  we could have just gone straight to that but we didn't. And that's fine.

520
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,680
Speaker 4:  But where we're actually headed and I think where Apple has pretty clearly

521
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,280
Speaker 4:  been wanting to head for a long time is wireless charging. Wireless charging

522
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,240
Speaker 4:  is mostly still very bad and not as good

523
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,080
Speaker 4:  or fast as wired charging. So I think we still have a ways to go, but I agree.

524
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,840
Speaker 4:  I think, I think especially some of the stuff we're seeing at EFA that we're

525
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,240
Speaker 4:  gonna talk about a little later, it's, it's pretty exciting. Richard, do

526
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,480
Speaker 4:  you care about this? iPhone convince me to care about this iPhone. Well

527
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,320
Speaker 6:  I had more things to convince you about the iPhone.

528
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,000
Speaker 4:  Oh, you're not done. Okay. You didn't talk about the action button yet. Hit

529
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,160
Speaker 4:  me.

530
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,760
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Wait, I was about to say the action button. I think it's the stupidest

531
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,040
Speaker 6:  thing in the world and I'm not excited about the action button. I I would

532
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,680
Speaker 6:  be excited about the action button if it didn't replace the mute button and

533
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,600
Speaker 6:  like if I'm just gonna have to program it to be the mute button, then it's

534
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,040
Speaker 6:  not an action button, it's just a mute button that I had to like do an extra

535
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:38,000
Speaker 6:  step to make a mute button. I want, I want both.

536
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,950
Speaker 4:  I just straight up had to look at my phone to see, see if it still had a

537
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,040
Speaker 4:  mute button. That thing has been on mute since the minute I took it outta

538
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,440
Speaker 4:  the package and I have not touched it since anyone who lets their phone ring

539
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,680
Speaker 4:  loud is 75 years old. Blanket rule of the

540
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,880
Speaker 4:  universe. If your phone rings, you are a hundred years old and

541
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,560
Speaker 6:  Should, don't you like being able to just go, oh, is it on mute?

542
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,440
Speaker 6:  Take a quick look or like reach into your pocket and go, eh, and kind of

543
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,240
Speaker 6:  hit the little switch while you're walking down the street and be like, yeah,

544
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,720
Speaker 6:  it's on mute. I I I just want, I want that. I like that.

545
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,840
Speaker 6:  I don't wanna have to like pull my phone out, program the mute button and

546
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,480
Speaker 6:  then hit mute.

547
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,840
Speaker 8:  You don't miss the art of Ring of ring tones.

548
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,880
Speaker 6:  They're trying to bring ring tones back by getting rid of the mute button.

549
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,160
Speaker 6:  No,

550
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,040
Speaker 4:  Maybe it's the opposite. Maybe they're killing it forever. It's like your

551
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,840
Speaker 4:  phone can no longer make noise when it rings would be like

552
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,280
Speaker 4:  truly Apple's most innovative feature in years.

553
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,520
Speaker 6:  They have to go to my mother's house and explain that to her. Like

554
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,480
Speaker 6:  I'm not doing it. I'm not letting anyone at the like Apple Tim Cook

555
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,800
Speaker 6:  has to fly to my mother's house and explain to her why her phone doesn't

556
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,240
Speaker 6:  ring anymore.

557
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,480
Speaker 4:  Does your mom have the ringtone that rings like an old timey phone? My

558
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,680
Speaker 4:  mother-in-law has that ringtone and it drives me nuts.

559
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,400
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah, she's got the ringtone and she's got it on her watch too,

560
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,480
Speaker 6:  which she answers in the supermarket. I learned so sorry to all the

561
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,880
Speaker 6:  H H E Bs shoppers of Texas for having to listen to all

562
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,520
Speaker 6:  of my conversations with my mom while she's picking up groceries. It's great.

563
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,240
Speaker 4:  Alright, before we go to break Alex, you wrote down one other one in the

564
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,720
Speaker 4:  fall, things coming up that you're excited about. Give us 30 seconds. Then.

565
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,440
Speaker 4:  We're going yes,

566
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,640
Speaker 6:  Starfield. It's the new Bethesda game. Like all other

567
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,440
Speaker 6:  Bethesda games, I think it's gonna be stupid, but then I'm, I'm reading all

568
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,520
Speaker 6:  the reviews and now I really wanna play it. But I also know that like every

569
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,160
Speaker 6:  other Bethesda game, I'm gonna play it for a hundred, 200 hours. Never finish

570
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,520
Speaker 6:  it and tell everybody it sucks. I'm so excited. So

571
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,200
Speaker 4:  Stupid is not the word you're looking for here.

572
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,560
Speaker 6:  It's gonna be stupid. It's gonna be like the characters look stupid. I

573
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,440
Speaker 6:  feel stupid playing it because I'm like, oh you can't look dumb. Like the

574
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,400
Speaker 6:  Bethesda characters look dumb and that's a bummer. And so

575
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,360
Speaker 6:  far that seems to be the case for this game as well. But also I

576
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,280
Speaker 6:  wanna travel around delivering coffee in space. That seems cool. I don't

577
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,360
Speaker 6:  wanna do that in real life, but I wanna do that in Space.

578
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,600
Speaker 4:  Richard's just like, if it's not Overwatch, don't even talk to me.

579
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,760
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I'm sorry. I I I want another games as a service shooter. Just something

580
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,320
Speaker 8:  I can play in 15 minute. You

581
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,880
Speaker 6:  Just wanna play Red Fall forever. Like that's,

582
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:08,000
Speaker 8:  If it weren't so terrible, if it were just any slight bit less terrible I

583
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,360
Speaker 8:  would, I would be playing it right now.

584
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,960
Speaker 4:  I like it. All right, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back

585
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,680
Speaker 4:  and we're gonna talk about all the other mishmash of nonsense

586
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,920
Speaker 4:  happening in the tech world this week. We'll be right back

587
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,540
Speaker 9:  This week on Intuit a TV and movie fall preview

588
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,620
Speaker 9:  from the new Scorsese film Killers of the Flower Moon. I

589
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,780
Speaker 10:  Was sent down from Washington DC to see about these murders

590
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,900
Speaker 9:  To the Golden Bachelor. He's Gary and

591
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,760
Speaker 4:  I'm your first

592
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,960
Speaker 11:  Golden Bachelor.

593
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:45,360
Speaker 9:  We'll tell you what to watch. Also a few recommendations of

594
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,080
Speaker 9:  stuff you might've missed so far this year, like Project Greenlight.

595
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,360
Speaker 13:  It's not excellent but it is a fascinating portrait of making

596
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,120
Speaker 13:  movies and the problem with making movies at this

597
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:57,840
Speaker 13:  moment.

598
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,680
Speaker 9:  This week on Intuit Vultures Pop culture podcast.

599
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,020

610
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,620
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. So lots of little news this week. There

611
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,460
Speaker 4:  was some threads news, it seems like we're getting search Sony

612
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,500
Speaker 4:  raised the prices on PlayStation plus we've got some

613
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,580
Speaker 4:  X doing sketchy stuff. I don't really wanna talk about that anymore.

614
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,020
Speaker 4:  Wireless carriers doing weird stuff. Again, call of duty using AI to moderate

615
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:11,700
Speaker 4:  voice chats, which is just America's worst idea in years.

616
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,100
Speaker 4:  Let's, let's just blast through all this. We can't get to all of this so

617
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,780
Speaker 4:  let's just lightning round this again.

618
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,860
Speaker 4:  Cranz, you're you were, you're still on the roll. You get to go first.

619
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,940
Speaker 6:  I'm so excited. So Dolby just announced this thing, it's called Dolby Atmos

620
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,180
Speaker 6:  Flex Connect and the name is very stupid. That's okay because

621
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,460
Speaker 6:  what it could do could potentially be very, very cool, which is that it will

622
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:37,460
Speaker 6:  automatically like just make your speakers, your

623
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,540
Speaker 6:  wireless speakers work with your TV provided they both support Dolby

624
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,100
Speaker 6:  Atmos Flex Connect and only one of TV will support that in the next year

625
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,060
Speaker 6:  that we know of. And it's from T C L, so it's not gonna work with any of

626
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,380
Speaker 6:  your current stuff and it's probably not gonna work with most of your stuff

627
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,100
Speaker 6:  next year, but like five years from now, this is gonna be

628
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,020
Speaker 6:  sick as hell. And I'm, I'm actually excited about it because like Sonos

629
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,300
Speaker 6:  has done a lot of this stuff in the past. They do the automatic calibration

630
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,460
Speaker 6:  and everything like that, but it's just Sonos and you have to use Sonos speakers

631
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,060
Speaker 6:  and you're stuck in that. And this means like okay I can go get any speaker,

632
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,740
Speaker 6:  like any wireless speaker I want and it's gonna bounce,

633
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,460
Speaker 6:  it's gonna take and pinging the audio from that speaker. The

634
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,020
Speaker 6:  TV's got its own microphones built in, it's gonna receive it and it's gonna

635
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,020
Speaker 6:  go oh and fix it all. You don't have to worry about a stupid soundbar because

636
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,940
Speaker 6:  sound bars are bad. I'm sorry you even though I own one, you don't

637
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,740
Speaker 6:  have to worry about like messing with anything. It should just

638
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,820
Speaker 6:  all work. And for like the last what 20

639
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,520
Speaker 6:  years TV audio has not just worked.

640
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,840
Speaker 6:  So that feels appealing even though you're still like

641
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,800
Speaker 6:  now gonna have to buy additional speakers for your tv. At least

642
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,800
Speaker 6:  it should make it a lot easier and more natural

643
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,120
Speaker 6:  and hopefully cheaper than the Soto solution, which

644
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,720
Speaker 6:  is why I'm not buying a new iPhone this year.

645
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,400
Speaker 4:  So the idea seems to be, if I'm understanding this correctly, yes

646
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,480
Speaker 4:  and I'm genuinely not sure that I am, but if I, if I'm understanding this

647
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,280
Speaker 4:  correctly, it's that you don't have to buy like a

648
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:13,000
Speaker 4:  full surround sound set. You don't have to buy that one

649
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,000
Speaker 4:  gigantic box at Best Buy. You can, you can sort of bring your own

650
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,280
Speaker 4:  speakers and essentially as long as they're like compatible with this one

651
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,080
Speaker 4:  Flex Connect spec, Dolby will be able to

652
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,240
Speaker 4:  stitch them all together. You'll be able to put them in a system and it'll

653
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,320
Speaker 4:  work.

654
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that that, that's it. Like theoretically if Vizio supports

655
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,920
Speaker 6:  this, you can go get those super cheap but decent

656
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:39,600
Speaker 6:  Vizio speakers set it all up and then instead

657
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,280
Speaker 6:  of like getting all weird and finicky and trying to use the not very good

658
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,120
Speaker 6:  super cheap Vizio technology to make the speakers sound good, just have

659
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,760
Speaker 6:  Dolby do it and do it well and it'll all sound

660
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,680
Speaker 6:  well. So

661
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,800
Speaker 4:  This seems great. This also seems like a thing that shouldn't be that hard

662
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,200
Speaker 4:  to do and probably should have happened 15 years ago, right?

663
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,920
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah. Like Sonos does it now and Sonos is wildly

664
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,760
Speaker 6:  expensive. The TV companies have not really cared about speaker. Like

665
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,520
Speaker 6:  they haven't cared about this, they haven't needed to. 'cause they're like

666
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,320
Speaker 6:  okay for them there's three, there's three TV

667
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,600
Speaker 6:  buyers, right? There's the people who spend all of

668
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,240
Speaker 6:  their time in AV forum. It's like me and Eli like we're over,

669
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,480
Speaker 6:  we're over there and and we're gonna go buy a bunch of stuff and we're gonna

670
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,280
Speaker 6:  spend 12 years working on our system and it's gonna sound beautiful and

671
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,320
Speaker 6:  people will ask us how much we spent and we'll have to run from the room

672
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,120
Speaker 6:  screaming and saying you don't need to know that. That's us. Then

673
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,080
Speaker 6:  there's like me a couple of years ago and a lot of

674
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,320
Speaker 6:  people, probably most people listening to this who are like, I want speakers

675
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,640
Speaker 6:  that sound good. So you go and you buy some speakers, they're Sonos or Visio

676
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,480
Speaker 6:  or whatever and you plug 'em into your TV and it sounds reasonably

677
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,400
Speaker 6:  good, probably not as good as any C R T TV you had 20 years ago

678
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,360
Speaker 6:  but decent. And then there's everybody else who doesn't

679
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,800
Speaker 6:  listen to The Vergecast and doesn't know that all speakers and TVs suck

680
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,840
Speaker 6:  because speakers require space and TVs don't give them any. And so

681
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,600
Speaker 6:  they go and they buy a TV and they're like, wow, the speakers stop. So they

682
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,440
Speaker 6:  turn the volume way up, they turn on the subtitles and they're just like,

683
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,160
Speaker 6:  why can't I hear anything anymore? And while part of that is definitely the

684
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,920
Speaker 6:  fault of Hollywood, so much of it is the fault of bad TV bakers

685
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,000
Speaker 6:  not caring. And they're like, well if you care that much, go be one of those

686
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,840
Speaker 6:  people who buys speakers from us and puts it in the

687
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,920
Speaker 6:  back. We don't care enough to like make it nice but do it.

688
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,880
Speaker 4:  There was this post I saw, I forget which social platform it was on, there's

689
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,360
Speaker 4:  too many of them at this point. But there was somebody who was like, guys

690
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,400
Speaker 4:  you don't even know. The reason you think Netflix sounds so bad is because

691
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,960
Speaker 4:  by default its sound is turned to 5.1 and if you are using

692
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,680
Speaker 4:  your built-in speakers, that means you're not getting the right ones. Just

693
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,520
Speaker 4:  go and switch it to stereo and everything will be amazing. And this post

694
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,400
Speaker 4:  went like hugely viral. Everybody like, oh my God, you've solved it.

695
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,200
Speaker 4:  And I was just like, my guy, like this ain't it. You didn't do it. You just

696
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,760
Speaker 4:  had a setting wrong on your Netflix. Like I don't know what to tell you.

697
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,800
Speaker 4:  That is not it. And also you're gonna put it on stereo and you're gonna be

698
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,320
Speaker 4:  like, oh, now it sounds bad in stereo

699
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,000
Speaker 6:  From two sides instead of five.

700
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,760
Speaker 4:  I don't know. Richard, you're, you're a guy who lives in V forums and owns

701
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,360
Speaker 4:  30 or 40 televisions. Does, does this idea excite you?

702
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,680
Speaker 8:  I think it sounds great from the idea that, okay, so you can just go get

703
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,360
Speaker 8:  some speakers and press the button and it'll say, alright,

704
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,120
Speaker 8:  I'll get, I'll get the sound figured out. And that's kind of always been

705
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,960
Speaker 8:  the problem of Atmos is that they've programmed in the sound. So it doesn't

706
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,160
Speaker 8:  need like, okay so how many channels do you have? Do you have two channels?

707
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,640
Speaker 8:  Do you have 2.1? Do you have 5.1? Do you have 7.1? Do you have 9.1

708
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:40,400
Speaker 8:  8.2? No, I have some speakers do it for me. Yeah,

709
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,240
Speaker 8:  and you'll do it also. They have never gotten

710
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,640
Speaker 8:  surround sound audio, right? Ever at any point. It has never been seamless.

711
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,920
Speaker 8:  It has never worked the way that it should. So I don't know why we should

712
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,800
Speaker 8:  expect that. It will. And

713
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,800
Speaker 6:  I'm an optimist at heart Richard.

714
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,120
Speaker 8:  The, the thing is the technology exists, like this should be possible. This,

715
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,400
Speaker 8:  this is the kind of thing that like with a microphone in the tv with speakers,

716
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,720
Speaker 8:  with the right technology you could do it. I'm sure that it will make Dolby

717
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,000
Speaker 8:  money as they get licensing fees from all the speakers that are now compatible.

718
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,280
Speaker 8:  How long it'll be be until I can use this in my own living room. I'm not

719
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,600
Speaker 8:  so sure.

720
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:17,040
Speaker 6:  Well You know if it sucks, which it very well

721
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,960
Speaker 6:  could, but it's a good idea. Somebody else could go

722
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,440
Speaker 6:  like, can be like, oh, like physio could just go and do that.

723
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,680
Speaker 8:  Well it'll be d t s not Flex Connect.

724
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah. D t s Flex Connect.

725
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I just, I always think about like the, so the the Ultimate Ears

726
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:38,560
Speaker 4:  boom series are like the best Bluetooth speakers on the planet. And one of

727
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,840
Speaker 4:  the things that they've done really well is you can actually daisy chain

728
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,840
Speaker 4:  a bunch of them together and it's not terribly complicated. It just

729
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,920
Speaker 4:  like synchronizes the sound coming out of a bunch of speakers, right? So

730
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,640
Speaker 4:  if you have a big house and you don't wanna rig up a whole speaker system,

731
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,760
Speaker 4:  you can just put four Bluetooth speakers around the house, sync them all

732
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,840
Speaker 4:  together and it plays. And the fact that that alone is like an innovative

733
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,440
Speaker 4:  feature in speakers is bananas. Like you can do this with

734
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,680
Speaker 4:  Bluetooth, you can do this with wifi. Like this is not a complicated

735
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,480
Speaker 4:  technological problem. We've done much harder things than

736
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,360
Speaker 4:  make speakers play. And I think like to Richard's point about

737
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,440
Speaker 4:  You know a a million different kinds of surround sound, none of them that

738
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,080
Speaker 4:  have ever been done very well. I think just the fact that it's as difficult

739
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,560
Speaker 4:  as it is to buy like two pretty good speakers, stick them on the either side

740
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,840
Speaker 4:  of your television and have it work is nuts. Like that's the reason I tell

741
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,640
Speaker 4:  people to buy Soundbars because you don't have to program it You know where

742
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,360
Speaker 4:  it goes, just don't worry about it. Even buying two speakers

743
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,640
Speaker 4:  ends up being more work than it's worth for not that much better sound most

744
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,480
Speaker 4:  of the time. So I think the idea that it's going to like perfectly correctly

745
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,320
Speaker 4:  tune your room. I, I agree. I don't trust, but I really hope it

746
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,200
Speaker 4:  works. Like I super, super, super hope it works. 'cause it would be awesome

747
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:47,800
Speaker 4:  five

748
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,760
Speaker 6:  Years from now, it'll be, it'll be cheaper than Sonos

749
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,120
Speaker 6:  and not as good but better than nothing.

750
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,160
Speaker 4:  I mean, I'll take it,

751
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:59,200
Speaker 6:  Which is the entire story of a home theater audio at this

752
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,440
Speaker 6:  point

753
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,120
Speaker 4:  As is Dolby almost. Got it. Right. That's like, that's

754
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,080
Speaker 4:  Dolby's slogan. Like we all, we almost got it this time.

755
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,720
Speaker 6:  No, we're not gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna run for the last second screwed

756
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,440
Speaker 6:  up. Sorry guys.

757
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Richard, what's your next one? Yeah,

758
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,880
Speaker 8:  You know my, my thing is Google's Duet ai becoming

759
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,720
Speaker 8:  available in Docs and Gmail and other Workspace apps. You know you reported

760
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,360
Speaker 8:  on this this week. I wanna hear more from you about the people you talk to

761
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,200
Speaker 8:  and all the things they said. But what strikes me is the price. We saw

762
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,000
Speaker 8:  this with the Microsoft binging AI and then making it available in Microsoft

763
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,520
Speaker 8:  365 and it looks like Google's going about the same, same way

764
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:38,600
Speaker 8:  they're charging, it looks like $30 per person per month. That's a lot of

765
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,240
Speaker 8:  money. And as soon as I saw that with the Microsoft thing, and now I see

766
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,880
Speaker 8:  it with Google, I understand why they're pushing AI so hard because they're

767
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,160
Speaker 8:  gonna make a lot of money from it. The bad news is that the companies who

768
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,440
Speaker 8:  buy it, they're probably gonna wanna save money somewhere else. Whether or

769
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,920
Speaker 8:  not these AI tools actually work or make people more productive or do not,

770
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,520
Speaker 8:  they're going to be spending a lot of money on them. So there's gonna be

771
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,520
Speaker 8:  cut somewhere else and it, it just seems like that's assured.

772
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,280
Speaker 6:  Is it $30 per month per head

773
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:03,920
Speaker 6:  user?

774
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like

775
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,600
Speaker 6:  Per account? Yes.

776
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:06,320
Speaker 4:  Yep.

777
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,920
Speaker 6:  No, yeah. Nope. Hard pass.

778
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,360
Speaker 6:  That's a no for me it would have to be magic.

779
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:17,120
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Like do You know? Do you, can you then, can you just think for a second

780
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,520
Speaker 8:  how good it would have to be to justify that price? It would

781
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,440
Speaker 6:  Have to be magic.

782
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,960
Speaker 4:  There's like a, there's a set of people who will just get

783
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:28,600
Speaker 4:  this because it's useful and there's a set of these things that I think are

784
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,400
Speaker 4:  like time saving in a way that will actually be meaningful to people,

785
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,280
Speaker 4:  right? Like the, the idea that I can, I don't know, take a

786
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,120
Speaker 4:  Google doc and say Duet turn this into a spreadsheet and

787
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,040
Speaker 4:  it'll turn it into like a

788
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,520
Speaker 4:  remedial but functional Google Slides Deck in 45 seconds

789
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,320
Speaker 4:  is like, there are a lot of people to whom that is worth $30 a month

790
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,520
Speaker 4:  easily. There are a lot of people who essentially do that one thing for a

791
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,560
Speaker 4:  living. And I think the question of what happens to those people to your

792
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,920
Speaker 4:  point is really interesting and really complicated and probably really messy

793
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,000
Speaker 4:  and bad in the long run for those people. But I, I tend

794
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,600
Speaker 4:  to agree that I, I think the number of people for whom there are

795
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,360
Speaker 4:  $30 a month worth of good features in Google

796
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:16,200
Speaker 4:  Duet is gonna be smaller than Google thinks. And I think it's gonna be the

797
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,800
Speaker 4:  same with copilot that like if you just give it to people, they'll use it

798
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,760
Speaker 4:  because having a thing that can You know, clean up my email grammar or

799
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:28,280
Speaker 4:  make a graph out of my spreadsheet data for me is useful.

800
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I, I I would use that if it was just there. But paying

801
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,320
Speaker 4:  what amounts to like three x, the price of Google Workspace

802
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:41,040
Speaker 4:  for that is super, super, super steep. And I don't

803
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,320
Speaker 4:  know that Google has made a particularly convincing case that this is gonna

804
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,680
Speaker 4:  like work. Like we've all used Bard in the last six months. I don't really

805
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,800
Speaker 4:  have any reason to believe this thing is going to be as good as they say

806
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,080
Speaker 4:  it is.

807
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,320
Speaker 6:  Is it gonna work with like your calendar?

808
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,280
Speaker 4:  What do you mean?

809
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,560
Speaker 6:  The only thing I would pay $30 a month for is an

810
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,200
Speaker 6:  AI that just understood and did all my calendar scheduling for me.

811
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:04,960
Speaker 6:  Like including the polite dms to people to be like, can I put some time on

812
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,480
Speaker 6:  your calendar? Is this okay all like, I want it to just do all of that.

813
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,960
Speaker 6:  If it did all of that, I, I personally would pay $30. I don't know if

814
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,880
Speaker 6:  I could get Vox Media to agree to pay $30, but like I'd

815
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,200
Speaker 6:  be like, oh, I'll see you check. Let's do that on

816
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,160
Speaker 4:  The side. There's an app called Motion, I think it's motion.io I think

817
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:27,080
Speaker 4:  that does exactly that and I think it's like $15 a month.

818
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,200
Speaker 6:  But is it trustworthy?

819
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,400
Speaker 4:  I haven't used it in a while, but by all accounts it's actually pretty good.

820
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,040
Speaker 4:  I hate those apps. Yeah. Like even as a person who is like obsessed with

821
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,320
Speaker 4:  my calendar and spends way too much time, like managing the blocks in my

822
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,080
Speaker 4:  calendar, I

823
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,000
Speaker 6:  Can, I can't trust them.

824
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,040
Speaker 4:  No. 'cause it's like tell us about your flow state and we'll schedule and

825
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,600
Speaker 4:  I'm like, I don't know. It like depends on what I ate for lunch that day.

826
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,720
Speaker 4:  Like leave me alone calendar.

827
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,680
Speaker 6:  I was like, no, you should just know. Like I basically want an assistant

828
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:56,080
Speaker 6:  but it's only $30 a month. I am the problem with the economy,

829
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,400
Speaker 6:  I'm why they're all so excited.

830
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,920
Speaker 4:  You're literally the reason they built Duetta. Like here's the

831
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,880
Speaker 4:  best we can do, but

832
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,830
Speaker 6:  I don't trust it. Like a person I would be like, Hey, don't do that in

833
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:11,390
Speaker 6:  the future. And they'd be like, yeah, pay me more than $30 a month. That'd

834
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:15,350
Speaker 6:  be fair. Fair. But like I, I

835
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:19,310
Speaker 6:  just can't imagine trusting it because when it would

836
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,150
Speaker 6:  screw up, it would probably screw up in the worst way. It would probably

837
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:25,790
Speaker 6:  like decline an invite from an Apple event, which would be

838
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,310
Speaker 6:  hysterical and be like, no, you're not going to that. Decline it and be like,

839
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,830
Speaker 6:  you've gotta go do your performance review. And I'd be like, no, those are

840
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,950
Speaker 6:  two different things and one matters more in this moment. Performance reviews

841
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:38,790
Speaker 6:  always matter, but not on the same day as Apple events.

842
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:41,790
Speaker 4:  I don't know, I just think like

843
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:46,910
Speaker 4:  my initial read of Duet is very much that like,

844
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,190
Speaker 4:  this is clear evidence that Google has not figured out what the killer

845
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:55,190
Speaker 4:  app for AI is for. And it's the same with Microsoft where they, they've come

846
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,870
Speaker 4:  up with a lot of relatively small, mostly

847
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,710
Speaker 4:  useful sounding things that these tools can do without anything that you're

848
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:06,590
Speaker 4:  immediately like, oh, I need that in my life. I'm also cognizant of the

849
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,110
Speaker 4:  fact that the three of us do not have real jobs

850
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:15,030
Speaker 4:  and that most jobs involve email spreadsheets

851
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:19,310
Speaker 4:  and slide decks. And most people and

852
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,350
Speaker 4:  most companies would be willing to pay a lot of money to make any of those

853
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:25,150
Speaker 4:  three things slightly more efficient. And

854
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,130
Speaker 4:  like Google's bet is essentially like, okay, if we can make each one of one

855
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:32,080
Speaker 4:  of those a little tiny bit better, we can help you write emails faster. We

856
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,960
Speaker 4:  can help you like get more actual data out of your spreadsheet.

857
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,680
Speaker 4:  We can help you make more beautiful decks on deadline.

858
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:41,320
Speaker 4:  Like that might work.

859
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,160
Speaker 6:  All they have to do is be like, we'll do the pivot tables and you'll never

860
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,040
Speaker 6:  have to understand what a pivot table is. Like a

861
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,920
Speaker 6:  lot of places would probably be like, yeah, $30 a month, never

862
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:54,280
Speaker 6:  have to learn about a pivot table.

863
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:58,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And then every just out of business school employee on planet

864
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,240
Speaker 4:  Earth just got fired. Like right as I was saying that sentence, they all

865
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,640
Speaker 4:  lost their jobs. Yeah. Sorry

866
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:02,880
Speaker 6:  Guys.

867
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:06,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. If you are a like junior account executive

868
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,320
Speaker 4:  at a marketing company, like you're so screwed. And I'm so sorry.

869
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:13,920
Speaker 8:  Fortunately the thing that you'll, that we'll be replacing you, our boss

870
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:18,280
Speaker 8:  asked Bard, what's the coolest thing anyone could do and receive some

871
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,120
Speaker 8:  answers. Can you

872
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,600
Speaker 4:  Just read the

873
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,080
Speaker 8:  List? Some cool things people have done. It's so good. Include

874
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,760
Speaker 8:  walking to a destination, even if it's 3000 miles away

875
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,920
Speaker 8:  playing World of Warcraft for 100 hours in a week. Yes.

876
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:31,480
Speaker 6:  I'm cool.

877
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,040
Speaker 8:  Being in a movie with Will Smith. Pretty cool. Pretty cool, cool

878
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,960
Speaker 8:  things in the world include chewing gum skateboards and cohort

879
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,080
Speaker 8:  outfits. I don't know. I don't know what those are. I guess I'm not cool

880
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,360
Speaker 8:  enough.

881
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,320
Speaker 6:  You're

882
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,080
Speaker 8:  Not cool enough. The bar knows.

883
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:45,920
Speaker 4:  Don't feel bad. Yeah.

884
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,280
Speaker 6:  Who do we also cool for like 1995 with a

885
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,040
Speaker 6:  queuing gum and a skateboard? We were bad asses.

886
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:57,000
Speaker 4:  You know, there's like a, there's a marketing person at like a fashion agency

887
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,520
Speaker 4:  right now who is furiously Googling what is the coolest thing anyone can

888
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,880
Speaker 4:  do. And just being like, I would not pay $30 a month for this.

889
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:06,560
Speaker 6:  This is it.

890
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,320
Speaker 4:  And I just, I very much enjoyed that. Eli's when when he posted that, he

891
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,880
Speaker 4:  was like, I can't believe it didn't say a back flip, which is objectively

892
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,840
Speaker 4:  the coolest thing. Could It's, yeah. It's very good. But I, I like

893
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,160
Speaker 4:  all of this stuff to me just says, none of this is

894
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,640
Speaker 4:  finished yet. And it's kind of wild to see

895
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,520
Speaker 4:  who is willing to pay for this stuff even though it's at the very, very,

896
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,960
Speaker 4:  very, very beginning of whatever it's gonna someday be. And

897
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,080
Speaker 4:  who is going to say at the end of their free trial, this is neat.

898
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,720
Speaker 4:  Not worth $30 a month per person for my entire company. And

899
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,800
Speaker 4:  if I were a betting man, I would bet on that second thing being a lot

900
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,760
Speaker 4:  more true than either Google or Microsoft. Think

901
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,240
Speaker 6:  How long is the trial?

902
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,200
Speaker 4:  I don't know.

903
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,120
Speaker 6:  Because like if it's like a year long trial, maybe they have a shot they

904
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,320
Speaker 6:  can take the year to figure out how to make it useful. If it's a one month

905
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,240
Speaker 6:  trial like, yo, what are you doing? You gave, you gave Richard

906
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:03,680
Speaker 6:  more time than you're giving these people. Come on.

907
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,560
Speaker 4:  I think it might be 30 days. I think that is, I think that might be how long.

908
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:07,760
Speaker 4:  It's

909
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,560
Speaker 8:  Absolutely not. I think their bet is that the executive who makes the decision

910
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,160
Speaker 8:  is the person who's going to find it really useful right away. And they'll

911
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,280
Speaker 8:  just say, yeah, we'll sign off on it and we'll fire a hundred other people.

912
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,760
Speaker 8:  It doesn't matter how, how well it works or does not work. And we just saw

913
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,440
Speaker 8:  this week of, I think Walmart announced that, that they're gonna roll out

914
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,800
Speaker 8:  AI for basically all their office employees. And they didn't say which one

915
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,960
Speaker 8:  they're using or how much they're paying, paying or anything. But I wonder

916
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,800
Speaker 8:  how, how much, how long they'll stick with it and how many people will continue

917
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,400
Speaker 8:  to have access to it.

918
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,400
Speaker 6:  It's gonna be the Walmart ai, that's what it's gonna be called.

919
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:39,160
Speaker 6:  And they're not gonna pay it very well, but it's gonna do the

920
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,840
Speaker 6:  job and then the rest of us will subsidize it with our tax dollars. And

921
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,280
Speaker 4:  There will be one in your town before You know it.

922
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:48,400
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There'll be one in every town. It's gonna be great. It's gonna get

923
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,320
Speaker 6:  rid of all the other little, little mom and pop AI stores

924
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,200
Speaker 6:  in your town. I'm so sorry.

925
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,960
Speaker 8:  The AI needs to unionize

926
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,160
Speaker 4:  Now. That is gonna be, when this gets really interesting, the

927
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,400
Speaker 6:  AI labor movement for the through ais themselves,

928
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:08,680
Speaker 4:  It's, I don't even, yeah, we'll come back to that. My lightning round thing

929
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,440
Speaker 4:  for this segment is I feel obligated to be the one continuing to chronicle

930
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:16,640
Speaker 4:  the ever consuming normalization of all of

931
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,960
Speaker 4:  these video apps in which they just all slowly become the exact same thing.

932
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,120
Speaker 4:  And the version of this this week is that Instagram appears to be working

933
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,960
Speaker 4:  on a version of Instagram Reels that lets you upload videos up to 10 minutes

934
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:31,960
Speaker 4:  long, which you can now do on TikTok, which TikTok did in order to be more

935
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,320
Speaker 4:  like YouTube, where people have always been able to watch You know longer

936
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:39,120
Speaker 4:  videos. And people on YouTube, of course, have started making shorter

937
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,760
Speaker 4:  videos for shorts, which was created to compete with

938
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,720
Speaker 4:  TikTok. And Reels is also created to, I could do this forever. The

939
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,560
Speaker 4:  point is, all of these apps are the goddamn same thing now.

940
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,720
Speaker 4:  And it's, they're not, though. It's driving me nuts and Alex. I, I

941
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,600
Speaker 4:  wanna get to why you're wrong very shortly here, but the last thing I want

942
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,280
Speaker 4:  to say about this is I think 10 minute vertical videos

943
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,920
Speaker 4:  are actually an extremely good idea. One weird thing

944
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,480
Speaker 4:  that I have discovered is that I just really like watching vertical things.

945
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,360
Speaker 4:  Like there's something to this sort of flow of like how you swipe and how

946
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,000
Speaker 4:  you watch and all that stuff. But also like, I think for a long time there

947
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,720
Speaker 4:  was this idea that you can't do as much in a vertical frame

948
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:23,280
Speaker 4:  and in certain ways that's true. But also like, I don't

949
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,000
Speaker 4:  mind, I found myself sitting watching longer things on vertical

950
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,640
Speaker 4:  screens than I thought. And like I'm holding my phone the way I normally

951
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,560
Speaker 4:  hold my phone. And so the idea that like somebody is gonna come out and make

952
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,040
Speaker 4:  like a show out of one of these 10 minutes at a time

953
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,280
Speaker 4:  I actually think is not crazy.

954
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,200
Speaker 6:  You mean like, like Quibi

955
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:43,280
Speaker 4:  Dude? So I listened to a podcast

956
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,920
Speaker 4:  this week, it's called The Big Flop or something like that. Oh

957
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,800
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I saw about this.

958
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,680
Speaker 4:  The first episode is about Quibi and the single

959
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,720
Speaker 4:  wildest take that I will say on this show this week is that it,

960
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,680
Speaker 4:  it convinced me that Quibi didn't actually miss by that much.

961
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,320
Speaker 6:  I I would agree honestly. I remember seeing Quibi at the time and being

962
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,920
Speaker 6:  like, this feels like it could be a really good idea if it's

963
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,440
Speaker 6:  executed well and that it was just executed terribly and also

964
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,560
Speaker 6:  released at the worst possible moment.

965
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,960
Speaker 6:  An app of that nature could have ever been released in the history of the

966
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,120
Speaker 6:  world.

967
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:23,480
Speaker 4:  Okay. So that's reasons two and three reason one is it was called Quibi.

968
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,840
Speaker 4:  Like that's the, that's the first thing that ruined Quibi. Like if Quibi

969
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:30,680
Speaker 4:  had been called Max, it would've had a real chance, right? Like it would've

970
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,840
Speaker 8:  If they hadn't spent a trillion dollars on content at the beginning

971
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,080
Speaker 4:  On like Flip My murder house

972
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:40,560
Speaker 8:  Given some YouTubers like 50 bucks,

973
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,640
Speaker 6:  The Rachel Brosnahan show where she just, the silver arb.

974
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,280
Speaker 4:  But this is what I'm saying, but bring Quibi back as 10 Minute Reels and

975
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,120
Speaker 4:  I'm into it. But yeah,

976
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,040
Speaker 8:  No vertical video is, it's a, it's a little limiting, but it also is

977
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,640
Speaker 8:  a little bit more focused and I think people generally do it better. It it

978
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,400
Speaker 8:  does work. It ha it has a place. But I kind of lean David's way. Alex,

979
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:04,240
Speaker 8:  they all just become TV shows eventually. Yeah. And I'm a person who's never

980
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,840
Speaker 8:  watched 10 minute videos on YouTube, so I'm not gonna watch 'em on Instagram.

981
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,560
Speaker 8:  I'm not gonna watch 'em on TikTok. I just won't do it.

982
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:11,800
Speaker 6:  Oh, I watch 'em on TikTok all the time. But it's the same ones I watch on

983
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,440
Speaker 6:  YouTube only now they're vertical and he, and the dude doesn't like cut,

984
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:19,120
Speaker 6:  like trim it to make it vertical. So a lot of times it's just like blank

985
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:22,720
Speaker 6:  space and you can hear him doing things because he's not in the frame. And

986
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,320
Speaker 6:  I'm like, yes.

987
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:26,480
Speaker 4:  It's just like his left hand in the frame and that's all you can see. See

988
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,360
Speaker 6:  You see like just a left hand cutting something and you're like, yeah, this

989
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,200
Speaker 6:  is great. It's so soothing. 'cause I already watched it on YouTube. But

990
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,880
Speaker 6:  I was gonna say like there is one big differentiator between all of these

991
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,120
Speaker 6:  and that is YouTube still does horizontal video and the other

992
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:41,760
Speaker 6:  ones don't.

993
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Speaker 4:  I mean, YouTube does, or

994
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,960
Speaker 8:  TikTok does do horizontal vi video. You can have videos that that rotate.

995
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,200
Speaker 8:  Yeah,

996
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,960
Speaker 6:  I just, I guess I haven't been presented with them. Am I supposed to be watching

997
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,040
Speaker 6:  this guy in horizontal all this time? If

998
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,320
Speaker 8:  You upload a, a widescreen video on TikTok, I think it'll like give you the

999
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,960
Speaker 8:  option. So like, it depends on how they uploaded it and what they did. Okay.

1000
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,880
Speaker 8:  But yeah, it definitely can do it.

1001
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:04,080
Speaker 4:  I have watched so many videos on TikTok that are the little horizontal video

1002
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,280
Speaker 4:  in the middle. 'cause it's like, yeah, CLIPP, it's like clipped from a YouTube

1003
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,760
Speaker 4:  video and then just gigantic letter boxes on top. You're telling me I could

1004
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,040
Speaker 4:  have been doing it better this whole time. I think there's

1005
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,000
Speaker 8:  Times I'm like tell you like, Hey, turn your, turn your phone. I'll just

1006
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,280
Speaker 8:  be like, yeah,

1007
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,320
Speaker 6:  This is service journalism here at The Verge. This

1008
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:22,120
Speaker 4:  Is also my favorite TikTok genre is people explaining little known

1009
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,600
Speaker 4:  features of TikTok. Like the thing where if you put your thumb on the left

1010
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,200
Speaker 4:  side of the screen, it plays at two x speed. Mind blowing. Yeah.

1011
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:33,480
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Learn how to use TikTok on TikTok. It's like the, it's it's like the

1012
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,720
Speaker 4:  YouTubers being mad at YouTube, like that's what they do on TikTok. It's

1013
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:36,840
Speaker 4:  great.

1014
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:37,760
Speaker 6:  Incredible.

1015
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:40,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah. All right, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come back

1016
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,840
Speaker 4:  and we're gonna go through some of the biggest announcements coming out of

1017
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:48,040
Speaker 4:  IFA, the gigantic European gadget show that is happening as we speak.

1018
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:48,640
Speaker 4:  We'll be right back.

1019
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,980
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. So none of us is at IFA this year.

1020
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:04,340
Speaker 4:  John Porter and Jen Tui were there. They did a lot of really great coverage

1021
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,820
Speaker 4:  for the site. There's a stream of all the stuff that they found. They went

1022
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,580
Speaker 4:  and just had adventures with vacuums and lights and headphones and

1023
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,820
Speaker 4:  speakers. And now

1024
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,460
Speaker 6:  They're sleeping

1025
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,700
Speaker 4:  And now they're sleeping. It really is how it goes. You basically, you go,

1026
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,740
Speaker 4:  you touch gadgets for three days with no sleep or food and then

1027
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,720
Speaker 4:  you drink heavily and go to sleep. And that's pretty much the run of one

1028
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,840
Speaker 4:  of those shows. So they are hopefully at this moment in the sleep phase of

1029
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,720
Speaker 4:  that. Not the drinking kids of that. It's listen, it's win both Win win both.

1030
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's either way. But let's, there was a bunch of things going

1031
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,320
Speaker 4:  on, but we, we've kind of figured out how to divide it into three categories

1032
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,920
Speaker 4:  of interesting stuff. And Richard, you alluded to one of them earlier.

1033
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:47,120
Speaker 4:  So take us through the, the like charging world of

1034
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:47,840
Speaker 4:  EFA this year.

1035
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:52,120
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It's all kind of centered around the iPhone 15 launch

1036
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,040
Speaker 8:  because Apple is finally going to release phone, we think with a

1037
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,760
Speaker 8:  USB C Port, first of all. So lightning and tons of

1038
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:03,560
Speaker 8:  Docs, tons of chargers, tons of stands that people have when they get a new

1039
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,760
Speaker 8:  phone starting this fall, those won't apply anymore. They're gonna need new

1040
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,680
Speaker 8:  chargers, they're gonna need new things, they're gonna need new cables. So

1041
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,520
Speaker 8:  of course all the companies that make those are just ready with new

1042
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,320
Speaker 8:  products. And beyond that, there's also this new standard QE two

1043
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,320
Speaker 8:  to replace the wireless cheese standard that assuming Apple

1044
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:25,160
Speaker 8:  supports, it could allow outside maker's Chargers to charge iPhones

1045
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,880
Speaker 8:  at up to 15 watts. You know just by touching it,

1046
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,560
Speaker 4:  Which would be like twice what it has been before, right?

1047
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:34,000
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It was 7.5. If you weren't a MagSafe charger, it was half the rate.

1048
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,480
Speaker 8:  So, and, and You know these things, they throttle kind of as it as it goes

1049
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,920
Speaker 8:  through the charging. So like it's not just gonna be twice as fast, but it'll

1050
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,840
Speaker 8:  be faster and you'll, you'll love it. Anker and Belkin are two of

1051
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,080
Speaker 8:  the companies that have announced Q two products. One of the things that

1052
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,240
Speaker 8:  I noticed about these announcements is that everyone who's announcing Q two

1053
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,000
Speaker 8:  products does not have a date for when they'll be released. They don't have

1054
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,920
Speaker 8:  a price, they don't really have anything. It's coming later this

1055
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,760
Speaker 8:  year probably maybe early next year for some things, but eventually, and

1056
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,760
Speaker 8:  I think we'll probably get a lot more clarity once the iPhone 15 is actually

1057
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,640
Speaker 8:  announced. But we've got stuff like battery packs, Anker, they've got it

1058
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,960
Speaker 8:  all branded under their MagGo line. They've got new stands, they've got

1059
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,800
Speaker 8:  You know different charges, different kind of desktop charges, all kinds

1060
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,960
Speaker 8:  of things. And the same thing for Belkin. And I think that this new Q two

1061
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,960
Speaker 8:  standard is going to be the kind of thing that you will actually

1062
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,000
Speaker 8:  replace several of the chargers that you have probably within your reach

1063
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,600
Speaker 8:  on your desk right now. I

1064
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:30,040
Speaker 4:  Just realized as you were talking that this is kind of about to be the most

1065
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,200
Speaker 4:  exciting moment for phone accessories like ever

1066
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,760
Speaker 8:  That there has ever been. Yeah.

1067
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,200
Speaker 4:  For the first time, if I'm an accessory maker, I can make something that

1068
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,920
Speaker 4:  works with your phone, your laptop, your tablet, your

1069
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,840
Speaker 4:  other phone, your partner's phone. Like you can build something that is

1070
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,600
Speaker 4:  going to work for everything and is going to last because I think

1071
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,840
Speaker 4:  you can reliably assume we're gonna be on USB C at least a few years

1072
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,360
Speaker 4:  from now. And so I have a feeling we're about to see like a

1073
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:02,480
Speaker 4:  glut of stuff and like Lord knows Anker alone is gonna make

1074
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,360
Speaker 4:  700 different USB C products between now and like

1075
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,360
Speaker 4:  September 12th.

1076
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:11,640
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And of course it, it's not all, if it's USB c it can work with

1077
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,560
Speaker 8:  whatever, but they, they have like a little thing that kind of latches onto

1078
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,160
Speaker 8:  the bottom of your iPhone with USB C. It does, it does. They can't show it

1079
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,920
Speaker 8:  connecting to an iPhone yet. But You know what it's, and and

1080
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,760
Speaker 8:  that's just kind of where, where we are with those products. So there's just,

1081
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,240
Speaker 8:  there's going to be even more and even better. I, I think kind of charging

1082
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,840
Speaker 8:  stuff. So if you're the kind of person who, when it's one of those Amazon

1083
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,480
Speaker 8:  deal days or something, you're like, okay, yeah, I'm gonna go get some chargers.

1084
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:36,240
Speaker 8:  It's time. It's going to be your time very soon.

1085
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,760
Speaker 4:  Cranz. This ones make you so happy. I'm,

1086
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,720
Speaker 6:  I'm not happy at all because I just bought so much wireless charging stuff

1087
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:46,000
Speaker 6:  like two months ago. I feel so dumb.

1088
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,960
Speaker 6:  I'm just like, I was like reading all of the news out of IFA being like

1089
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,040
Speaker 6:  rookie move Cranz just,

1090
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,360
Speaker 8:  It's every time when, when the prices are really good and you're like, oh,

1091
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,720
Speaker 8:  okay, I'll get it. It's all on sale. I I should, I should buy these.

1092
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,760
Speaker 6:  I got that wireless charger slash battery from Anker. That thing is

1093
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,000
Speaker 6:  great. The

1094
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,440
Speaker 4:  Little cube.

1095
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:06,480
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That like, oh it's beautiful.

1096
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,280
Speaker 4:  I love that thing. Yeah,

1097
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,720
Speaker 6:  I love it. And now I'm like, well damnit, there's another one and I want

1098
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,280
Speaker 6:  that one more 'cause it's got like a little screen has

1099
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,240
Speaker 8:  A screen on it now. Yeah.

1100
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:17,000
Speaker 6:  I'm like, so if anybody needs a a, a generation one charger,

1101
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,360
Speaker 6:  I'm in the market to, to sell it at cost.

1102
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,440
Speaker 4:  I do wonder if there's gonna be like a black market for old, old

1103
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,040
Speaker 4:  chargers and Docs going forward. Like all the people who just

1104
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:32,040
Speaker 4:  desperately hold onto their iPhone eight minis. Like I'm

1105
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:36,160
Speaker 6:  Re-gifting it all to family Christmas is gonna be really crummy

1106
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,560
Speaker 6:  for them and great for me

1107
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:41,320
Speaker 8:  The be before we're done with this, I wanna make the case for slow wireless

1108
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:45,240
Speaker 8:  chargers. I have the, the older Pixel stand near my bed now see if

1109
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,280
Speaker 8:  you're one of those people who you want to go to sleep and stop using your

1110
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,160
Speaker 8:  phone, one way to do that, put the wireless charger out of your reach.

1111
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:56,360
Speaker 8:  Yes. So that you have to decide, am I going to put the phone on the stand

1112
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,280
Speaker 8:  and let it charge overnight so that it's not empty, the battery isn't empty

1113
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,200
Speaker 8:  when I wake up, or am I going to use, use the phone and maybe fall asleep

1114
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,360
Speaker 8:  with it in my hand, wake up with a phone on zero and I don't have a fast

1115
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,440
Speaker 8:  charger to charge it up.

1116
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:07,960
Speaker 6:  That's good.

1117
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:11,400
Speaker 8:  That's stress. It, it will, it will improve your life. That's smart. Get

1118
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,200
Speaker 8:  yourself a slow charger.

1119
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:16,480
Speaker 4:  No disagree. I really like, I think the single most like

1120
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:20,080
Speaker 4:  aspirational thing I have done over the years is try to be a person who charges

1121
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,640
Speaker 4:  my phone outside of my bedroom. So many times I have tried to be this person,

1122
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,640
Speaker 4:  I'm like, okay, I'm gonna have a stack of like print books and magazines

1123
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,880
Speaker 4:  and that's what I'm gonna read before bed. I'm not gonna sit here and like

1124
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:34,480
Speaker 4:  scroll Reddit until I fall asleep. And after like

1125
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:38,680
Speaker 4:  three days, inevitably I'm like, how did my charger get right back into my

1126
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,120
Speaker 4:  room and next to my bed? And I'm scrolling Reddit again. Like I don't remember

1127
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:46,000
Speaker 4:  ever putting it back in here. And yet it has arrived. And I've, I've, I

1128
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,880
Speaker 4:  swear I've tried this 25 times in my life and I think it shows real personal

1129
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,880
Speaker 4:  growth that I have stopped trying. Like I think it says, it says a lot about

1130
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,480
Speaker 4:  me as a person.

1131
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:57,600
Speaker 6:  Are you, I mean you're not a very lazy person. So is just putting it on the

1132
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,960
Speaker 6:  other side of the, because putting it on the, the charger on the other side

1133
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,520
Speaker 6:  of the room, that's enough for me. Yeah. I'm that lazy that like once it's

1134
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,160
Speaker 6:  on there, I'm not getting outta bed again. For

1135
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,880
Speaker 4:  Me it's not getting, it's not even the laziness factor. It's like the, the

1136
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:13,520
Speaker 4:  actual feeling of getting out of bed is so awful still works.

1137
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:16,840
Speaker 4:  It's the taking off the covers. Like even if my charger was right there,

1138
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,170
Speaker 4:  but I had to take off the covers to get it, I wouldn't do it. Do it

1139
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:23,320
Speaker 6:  Is sometimes there's one time where I did that, but like I like army

1140
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:26,600
Speaker 6:  crawled across the floor with like the cover still on a single foot being

1141
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,320
Speaker 6:  like, ah,

1142
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,360
Speaker 4:  I'm not technically out of bed.

1143
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,720
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it worked. It was fine. It's fine.

1144
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:35,520
Speaker 4:  It's very good. But yeah, I, I suspect it's about to be a very, very, very

1145
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,200
Speaker 4:  exciting like six months in the accessory world. And the other thing I will

1146
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,000
Speaker 4:  say is this is just a p ss a to everyone now don't buy

1147
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:46,520
Speaker 4:  any accessories, don't buy any accessories the day Apple launches. Things

1148
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:49,320
Speaker 4:  don't buy any accessories the day it ships. Because what's gonna happen is

1149
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:53,240
Speaker 4:  between now and Christmas there's going to be this unbelievable glut

1150
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,720
Speaker 4:  of cool new stuff that comes out. And it's gonna happen really fast because

1151
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:00,440
Speaker 4:  all these companies are already making USB c stuff. So they're not gonna

1152
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,800
Speaker 4:  have to get used to a completely new connector. Apple will have some weird

1153
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:08,280
Speaker 4:  tweak to it because it always does. But there's going to be just a

1154
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:11,200
Speaker 4:  run of new things that all these companies are ready for. And so whatever

1155
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,000
Speaker 4:  you buy today or tomorrow or on September 12th, September

1156
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,440
Speaker 4:  20, whatever, when the iPhone ships, there will be something in November

1157
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:22,200
Speaker 4:  that is better and by Black Friday it will cost $5. So

1158
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,240
Speaker 4:  Alex Cranz stop buying accessories

1159
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,960
Speaker 6:  And like you were talking and I was like, actually maybe it was good that

1160
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,120
Speaker 6:  I just bought all of this stuff because we're not gonna be buying. I'm like,

1161
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:35,120
Speaker 6:  I, I can't, I just bought a new dining room table and four like wireless

1162
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,440
Speaker 6:  chargers. I'm broke for the next year. Like it's great.

1163
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:39,880
Speaker 4:  There you go. There we

1164
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,040
Speaker 6:  Go.

1165
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,480
Speaker 4:  Alright, you go next. Cranz. What, what did you look up for IFA? So there

1166
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,880
Speaker 6:  Was a lot of smart home stuff, ton of stuff. That's why my Jen was there

1167
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,600
Speaker 6:  and she was doing incredible work. A lot of stuff coming out from Philips

1168
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,720
Speaker 6:  Hugh who historically just does lights and

1169
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:58,200
Speaker 6:  if you like me, are tired of spending so much money on Hue lights.

1170
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:01,880
Speaker 6:  There's a lot of competitors in this space now. There's a ton of other really

1171
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,960
Speaker 6:  good lights. I've got some like little candelabra lights. They're beautiful.

1172
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:08,000
Speaker 6:  They do like the pride flag. It doesn't actually look like the pride flag.

1173
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:11,920
Speaker 6:  But in July I, or in June I was like, yeah, cool.

1174
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:16,040
Speaker 4:  Is Hugh still the best one though? I, I confess I'm slightly behind the times

1175
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,920
Speaker 4:  on my own personal smart home care, but my read was always Hugh

1176
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,560
Speaker 4:  is the best. It's also twice the price of everything else. Yeah.

1177
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:26,520
Speaker 6:  Hugh the, yeah, like, like it's, it's like the Apple deal for a long time

1178
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:30,080
Speaker 6:  where you're like, well sure I'm paying twice the price but I can smugly

1179
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:34,040
Speaker 6:  say it works. Can you say that Richard fair in

1180
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,840
Speaker 6:  your Windows machine? But that hurt.

1181
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,680
Speaker 6:  Can I say that about my Mac lately? No, but,

1182
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:47,240
Speaker 6:  but yeah, so it typically just works but it costs

1183
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,280
Speaker 6:  a ton more. But there's a, there's so much stuff out now in the space that

1184
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,200
Speaker 6:  really does also just work. Like I was using,

1185
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:58,320
Speaker 6:  adding stuff both to home assistant and to, to

1186
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:02,440
Speaker 6:  HomeKit zero issue. Like totally flawless. Even the

1187
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,360
Speaker 6:  stuff that some people complain about, like nano leaf can

1188
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,260
Speaker 6:  sometimes be a little buggy works. And so Hugh

1189
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,060
Speaker 6:  has a whole bunch of stuff. They've got track lighting now, which is big.

1190
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:18,040
Speaker 6:  That's exciting because oftentimes track lighting you can't replace like

1191
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,560
Speaker 6:  there's no little bulbs to go in there and replace that he probably would

1192
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,800
Speaker 6:  make if they could. So you have to get the whole thing. So that's cool.

1193
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:29,400
Speaker 6:  And they, they got into to security cameras, which is

1194
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,400
Speaker 6:  a big deal for them. They've, they've just been a company that does lights

1195
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:36,600
Speaker 6:  and now they're doing security cameras. Predictably expensive security

1196
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:36,920
Speaker 6:  cameras.

1197
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:41,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's very telling to me that that's where they went actually that like,

1198
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,320
Speaker 4:  I think it's, it's pretty obvious that if you're a company that wants to

1199
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:47,000
Speaker 4:  do smart home stuff, lights is the place to start. Right? It is kind of the,

1200
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:50,000
Speaker 4:  it's like the gateway drug to the smart home for basically everybody. And

1201
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,680
Speaker 4:  it's very interesting to me that after all this time the the Hue

1202
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,680
Speaker 4:  team looked around and was like, okay, what's the next thing we wanna do?

1203
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:00,840
Speaker 4:  And decided it was security cameras. Not like other sensors or

1204
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:04,560
Speaker 4:  weird things for your garage door or things for your car.

1205
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:08,200
Speaker 4:  It's just, it They're just like security cameras. Yeah.

1206
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:12,480
Speaker 6:  And, and these are very expensive. It's got end-to-end decryption. It

1207
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:16,840
Speaker 6:  currently does not work out of the box or won't work outta the box

1208
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:20,840
Speaker 6:  with Alexa and Google Assistants home security camera integrations.

1209
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:24,680
Speaker 6:  So you won't be able to just like play it on your little Google speaker anywhere.

1210
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,640
Speaker 6:  That kinda sucks. It won't work with Home kit and tell

1211
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,840
Speaker 6:  matter start supporting video for security cameras

1212
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:38,200
Speaker 6:  because that's the only way it's gonna work with HomeKit. It won't work

1213
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:42,080
Speaker 6:  with like home kit's secure video platform, which isn't actually very good

1214
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,600
Speaker 6:  to begin with. So that's not the worst one. Like that one you're like, oh

1215
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,280
Speaker 6:  that's kind of sucks. But also I'm fine with that or at least I am. But

1216
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:53,360
Speaker 6:  it will work with matter. And the most exciting part of all

1217
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:57,040
Speaker 6:  the Philips U news is it finally is gonna start supporting matter. It's pushing

1218
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:00,720
Speaker 6:  out an update next month. I am unreasonably

1219
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:03,680
Speaker 6:  excited. I've been spending this whole week being like, I cannot

1220
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:08,560
Speaker 6:  DMM Jen 'cause she's very busy working. And all I wanna

1221
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,360
Speaker 6:  do is be like, Jen, Jen, Jen, Jen, Jen, this is such a good moment. So I'm

1222
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,240
Speaker 6:  like being very patient and waiting until she comes back and gets over her

1223
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,480
Speaker 6:  hangover and, and is having a good time and then I'm gonna

1224
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:22,720
Speaker 6:  just assai her with it. But that's exciting. Like it's been

1225
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:26,840
Speaker 6:  ages since they promised matter. And the stuff I use that

1226
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:30,160
Speaker 6:  where Matter works is wonderful.

1227
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:34,560
Speaker 6:  I'm in the future. I'm having the best day of my life. I've set up my entire

1228
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:38,200
Speaker 6:  system. Oh it doesn't work with matter. I hate everything and everyone

1229
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,440
Speaker 6:  and I want it all to die. Especially my robot vacuum cleaner, which

1230
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,280
Speaker 4:  There were also a bunch of it IFA. I just love that the robot vacuums

1231
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:50,040
Speaker 4:  are becoming like an outrageously competitive

1232
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:53,800
Speaker 4:  space. There are so many good robot vacuums out there now. I love it.

1233
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,760
Speaker 6:  I, this was the first one I'd ever like, I tried one 10 years ago and it

1234
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,680
Speaker 6:  was garbage. And I was like, I'm okay. I can just walk around with a vacuum

1235
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:05,600
Speaker 6:  cleaner, like a normal person. And back this summer somebody was

1236
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,000
Speaker 6:  like, oh, go get a robot vacuum cleaner. They're really good now. And this

1237
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,520
Speaker 6:  was a person that I trust. And so I was like, you, you generally aren't stupid.

1238
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:15,720
Speaker 6:  And I went and I got one on sale and I was like, oh, it's really good now.

1239
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:19,600
Speaker 6:  It like, my house is just clean. That's, and with a dog

1240
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,240
Speaker 6:  that's not common. So

1241
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:26,360
Speaker 4:  They're good now. And now there's a, there the robot lawnmower

1242
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,280
Speaker 4:  industry is booming. I think Jen and John saw one of those. It's

1243
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,080
Speaker 6:  Starting to boom. Yeah, there was, she she was, she saw a robot

1244
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,440
Speaker 6:  lawnmower. The problem with robot lawnmowers is they generally have really

1245
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,320
Speaker 6:  crappy range and American lawns tend to

1246
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:45,200
Speaker 6:  be pretty big. Like they, they, they, there's a lot of space,

1247
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,680
Speaker 6:  there's a lot of stuff going on in them. And these weren't doing it very

1248
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,400
Speaker 6:  well. They're really meant for those little tiny like postage stamp

1249
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:56,280
Speaker 6:  lawns in Europe. And so this can do like half an acre,

1250
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:00,640
Speaker 6:  which I would've loved at the age of 13 when I had to hop on the

1251
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,200
Speaker 6:  riding lawnmower and like mow the front in the backyard and in the garden.

1252
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:07,000
Speaker 6:  It was the worst time of my life. My family still talks about how much I

1253
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,800
Speaker 6:  complained about it. This would've been amazing. I would've like been

1254
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,400
Speaker 6:  campaigning for it immediately. So I'm so excited. All you kids out there

1255
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,520
Speaker 6:  listening. I know there's a lot of 13 year olds that listen to The Vergecast

1256
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,040
Speaker 6:  and I know you're very excited about this. Start campaigning now. This is

1257
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,440
Speaker 6:  a great Christmas gift for you. Probably not. Your parents will not buy it

1258
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:28,280
Speaker 6:  'cause it's like $2,000. But aspirational. Aspirational.

1259
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:32,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Everybody talks about how like kids are not gonna grow up and learn

1260
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,880
Speaker 4:  how to drive and they're gonna miss like a key part of life. And I just feel

1261
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,880
Speaker 4:  like if, if your parents never force you to mow the lawn, like you, you've

1262
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,240
Speaker 4:  you've missed something. Yeah.

1263
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,000
Speaker 6:  You really have.

1264
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:44,000
Speaker 4:  It's like 111 degrees. It's called Tide. And you have a push mower that barely

1265
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,960
Speaker 4:  works and they're like, shut up, we're gonna pay you $1. Go mow

1266
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,400
Speaker 4:  for five hours David, and then rake all the leaves.

1267
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:55,800
Speaker 4:  It's fine. My childhood's fine. I hated the leaves. It's fine. It's the

1268
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:55,960
Speaker 6:  Worst.

1269
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:56,720
Speaker 4:  Oh, the

1270
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,400
Speaker 8:  Leaves. Yeah. Look man, spending, spending 45 minutes trying to get that

1271
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,680
Speaker 8:  thing to start is character building. That's

1272
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,040
Speaker 4:  Exactly right. You feel like

1273
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,160
Speaker 6:  You're, you're a mechanic afterwards. Like when somebody's car breaks down

1274
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,840
Speaker 6:  you're like, hold up. I've jump started a lawnmower. I think I can help.

1275
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,640
Speaker 6:  You can't, it doesn't work that

1276
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,680
Speaker 4:  Way. Is there a thing I can pull on really hard and hope that starts it.

1277
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:17,560
Speaker 6:  Alright,

1278
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:21,080
Speaker 4:  The last thing from Eva, which I should just run through real fast was there

1279
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,720
Speaker 4:  were a few headphone and speaker announcements, but a couple

1280
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,320
Speaker 4:  were actually very cool. So I just wanna basically, basically call out two.

1281
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:33,000
Speaker 4:  One is new Jabra headphones. They're called the Elite Tens

1282
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,840
Speaker 4:  and the Elite Eights, they're basically new wireless earbuds. I think

1283
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:40,760
Speaker 4:  Jabra in general does not get the shine it deserves in the headphones space.

1284
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,520
Speaker 4:  Everybody talks about AirPods and Pixel Buds and Galaxy Buds and kind of

1285
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,760
Speaker 4:  all the stuff that's like bundled with devices. Jabra does a really good

1286
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,360
Speaker 4:  job of making just like very good headphones that work with everything. It

1287
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,960
Speaker 4:  supports like all of the open standards. It can, it has really good noise

1288
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,600
Speaker 4:  cancellation. The mics tend to be pretty good. The battery life is pretty

1289
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,320
Speaker 4:  good. The audio

1290
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,480
Speaker 6:  Is good. Yeah,

1291
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,640
Speaker 4:  Like they're very good headphones but

1292
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:04,880
Speaker 6:  They're big. They sit like if you have tiny ear canals, that's, that's why

1293
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,760
Speaker 6:  I don't use 'em. 'cause my ear canals are too small.

1294
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:10,400
Speaker 4:  So that's actually one of the things that I think is exciting about these

1295
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,190
Speaker 4:  new ones. The elite tens, which are the higher end one, I think they're

1296
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,030
Speaker 4:  250 bucks. They have a like semi-open design,

1297
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:22,470
Speaker 4:  which in theory should help with that feeling of

1298
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:25,510
Speaker 4:  being sort of smooshed in your ear. Yeah. Personally I end up using very

1299
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:28,350
Speaker 4:  few of those kind of closed ear headphones because I get the same thing.

1300
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:32,270
Speaker 4:  Like my ear canals start to hurt after a while. If I listen to

1301
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:35,550
Speaker 4:  those, like I got the Sony link buds and they cau, they like

1302
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,790
Speaker 4:  cause pain or they fall out.

1303
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:41,750
Speaker 6:  I love that pain that like you're like, oh, it fits so good. Agony,

1304
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,590
Speaker 6:  agony, agony. Oh yeah, put this Taylor sounds lovely.

1305
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:48,430
Speaker 4:  Oh, it sounds amazing. Yeah. But I like, after 30 minutes I'm like, oh, I'm

1306
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:51,110
Speaker 4:  gonna lose both of my ears. Like this is cool. And they

1307
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:51,550
Speaker 6:  Feel like they're

1308
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:55,190
Speaker 4:  Bleeding. Yeah. But so the elite tens seem cool, sound great. They have six

1309
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:59,190
Speaker 4:  mics. I think the the audio quality should be good. They're supposedly one

1310
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:01,910
Speaker 4:  of the best. They've that Jabra Hass ever made. And then there's the Elite

1311
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:05,150
Speaker 4:  eight, I think it's technical called the Elite eight active that are

1312
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:09,670
Speaker 4:  IP 68 rated, which is like more or

1313
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:12,110
Speaker 4:  less everything you would need as a person. Yeah,

1314
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:13,550
Speaker 6:  You can get disgusting. Yeah,

1315
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:17,430
Speaker 4:  Exactly. It's like you can throw it in the wash and they'll come out fine

1316
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:21,630
Speaker 4:  and they're just super, super rugged. And personally like I lost a pair of

1317
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:25,030
Speaker 4:  AirPods because I got caught in a rainstorm. I lost another pair of AirPods

1318
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:28,270
Speaker 4:  because I dropped one of them in a puddle and then put it back in the charger

1319
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:31,910
Speaker 4:  and it ruined everything. Which if you're wondering, yes, it was stupid,

1320
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:34,310
Speaker 4:  but this is the life I lead. You

1321
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:34,870
Speaker 6:  Had to charge it.

1322
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:39,150
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And so just, I like blew on it a bunch of times and then put it back

1323
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:42,030
Speaker 4:  in the case. And then about 45 minutes later it was like that was the dumbest

1324
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:45,030
Speaker 4:  thing I could have possibly done. But now here we are. But so the idea of

1325
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,670
Speaker 4:  like a super ruggedized pair of pretty good headphones,

1326
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:51,710
Speaker 4:  I actually sound very exciting. But they both do wireless charging. They

1327
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:55,670
Speaker 4:  both do multi-point Bluetooth. They both do the mono mode, so you can

1328
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:58,950
Speaker 4:  just wear one earbud at a time. They just like have all the features. And

1329
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:01,590
Speaker 4:  I think like in general, if you're shopping for wireless headphones, most

1330
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:05,550
Speaker 4:  people don't think of Jabra and you should. But the other thing which I

1331
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:08,590
Speaker 4:  think is much more exciting is this new JBL,

1332
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,190
Speaker 4:  I think it's called the authentics speaker. Authentic.

1333
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:13,470
Speaker 6:  They look nice.

1334
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:17,270
Speaker 4:  They do, right? The 200, the 300 and the 400, yeah. They're all stupid

1335
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:21,110
Speaker 4:  expensive. They're like anywhere from 330 to $700

1336
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:22,950
Speaker 4:  for a Bluetooth speaker, which is preposterous.

1337
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,590
Speaker 6:  Can't put a price on fashion. But

1338
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:27,150
Speaker 4:  Not only are they great looking, they are, they have this like cool sort

1339
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:30,790
Speaker 4:  of fabricy retro thing going on, but they also have Alexa

1340
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:34,830
Speaker 4:  and Google assistant in one device and it can hear both wake words

1341
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:37,430
Speaker 4:  at the same time. You don't have to do the Sonos thing where in setup you

1342
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:40,950
Speaker 4:  pick which one you want to use. You can use both and you can tell it with

1343
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:44,470
Speaker 4:  one to start the music and with the other to stop the music. And they found

1344
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:48,430
Speaker 4:  some ways in which that gets weird. Like if you start a timer with Alexa

1345
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:51,510
Speaker 4:  and then you try to use Google to stop the timer, that doesn't quite work.

1346
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:52,830
Speaker 4:  But we,

1347
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:56,510
Speaker 6:  It worked if the timer was going off. But if you like started a timer and

1348
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,630
Speaker 6:  then you're like, oh no, didn didn't wanna do that timer. Oh, interesting.

1349
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:02,110
Speaker 6:  And you try to tell it to stop. Yeah. John like, I guess he got, he got to

1350
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:05,870
Speaker 6:  play with one and apparently just had a whole list of ways

1351
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:08,950
Speaker 6:  he was gonna screw with this thing. I love it. And just went through his

1352
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:12,560
Speaker 6:  whole list. He chronicled it all in his piece and it, I was just like,

1353
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:17,000
Speaker 6:  yeah. Yeah, just like chanting as I read it. It was great. Yeah,

1354
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,880
Speaker 4:  His piece is really great. And he also, he asked Google like,

1355
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:24,200
Speaker 4:  should I take this as the beginning of a trend? Is this gonna actually be

1356
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,840
Speaker 4:  the sort of interoperable voice assistant world we've been wanting to live

1357
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,800
Speaker 4:  in? And the Google representative was

1358
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,520
Speaker 4:  sort of sketchy about it and so who knows? And

1359
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,440
Speaker 6:  Then ran away fleeing.

1360
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:38,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean basically. But the, at least this proves that like this is a

1361
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:42,160
Speaker 4:  thing that can be done and here's hoping that it's not just on

1362
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,080
Speaker 4:  this one set of expensive JBL speakers. Do you

1363
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:48,120
Speaker 6:  Think Sonos is gonna do it at some point? Like a good version?

1364
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:53,120
Speaker 4:  I think at this point Sonos and Google are at such odds that I would be

1365
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,040
Speaker 4:  surprised if Google was interested in playing along with Sonos.

1366
01:14:56,230 --> 01:15:00,000
Speaker 6:  They would rather just get rid of it entirely. If it would piss off.

1367
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But like could the next youi boom that I buy

1368
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,440
Speaker 4:  because I'm inevitably gonna buy 500 more of those in my life. Could that

1369
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,800
Speaker 4:  have both? That would be awesome. Like the, the speaker world is big and

1370
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,760
Speaker 4:  wide and imagine if you could have them with the Dolby stuff that worked

1371
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:18,960
Speaker 4:  all over your house and you could talk to each individual one with whatever

1372
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,320
Speaker 4:  voice assistant you wanted. Like how is that not the world we live in? This

1373
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,560
Speaker 4:  is the world we should live in.

1374
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,400
Speaker 6:  That's the future. That's what I want. That's the interoperable future I

1375
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:27,640
Speaker 6:  want.

1376
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:31,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I just wanna yell whatever I want at my speakers and they have to listen.

1377
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,720
Speaker 8:  I do not wanna do that. I don't want to talk to my speakers ever about

1378
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,640
Speaker 8:  anything. But I do love these. They look incredible. Like if you remember

1379
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:42,640
Speaker 8:  how speakers looked, those old seventies and eighties speakers, you do have

1380
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,120
Speaker 8:  to look at these. Finally. Someone's bringing that back. I don't know why

1381
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,280
Speaker 8:  they didn't before, but they are now and I like it. Yeah,

1382
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,160
Speaker 6:  It's based on the L one hundreds, right from the seventies.

1383
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:55,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah. After like two decades of trying to make speakers look like spaceships.

1384
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:59,200
Speaker 4:  Now we're back to making them look like speakers and it makes me very happy.

1385
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:03,040
Speaker 4:  Like these, yeah, these look great. The one has a handle on it, which is

1386
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,920
Speaker 4:  basically just to remind you like, yes, you can pick this thing up. It's

1387
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,880
Speaker 4:  allowed, they have, they have actual knobs for all of

1388
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,560
Speaker 4:  the different levels. It's just wonderful. Like what a world.

1389
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:15,440
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I'm not, I'm not saying that you should do cocaine off of these speakers,

1390
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,000
Speaker 8:  but like if you wanted to. If you wanted

1391
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,520
Speaker 6:  To. Yeah, they've got some good, there's some good flat spaces there for

1392
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,240
Speaker 6:  a nice, a nice line. We don't endorse cocaine on The

1393
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,080
Speaker 6:  Vergecast.

1394
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:29,120
Speaker 4:  All right, well now that we've gone well and fully off the rails, it's time

1395
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,800
Speaker 4:  to end the first cast just in case this is the last episode

1396
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,760
Speaker 4:  you ever listened to. This is what I wanna leave you with.

1397
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:37,440
Speaker 6:  It's snowing somewhere.

1398
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:43,360
Speaker 4:  All right. A lot of good stuff on the site. This week we had the most recent

1399
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:47,560
Speaker 4:  piece in our big series investigating the effect of Google in the

1400
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,320
Speaker 4:  world. Ryan bro wrote a really great piece called The End of Google Verse.

1401
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:54,480
Speaker 4:  Really interesting. It's full of like old internet heads reminiscing on

1402
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,360
Speaker 4:  like the weird things people used to do with Google in the early two thousands.

1403
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:01,600
Speaker 4:  It's really fun. Our video team and our producer, Andrew Marino,

1404
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,480
Speaker 4:  made an amazing video with one of those heads

1405
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:09,490
Speaker 4:  that does bin oral audio and noise canceling headphones to like

1406
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:13,440
Speaker 4:  really test how good noise canceling is. It's a wild video

1407
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:17,200
Speaker 4:  with like lots of graphs that I didn't understand and tons of interesting

1408
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:21,120
Speaker 4:  people. And Andrew sweating to death on a summer in New York City. It's a

1409
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,880
Speaker 4:  really great video. Andrew also did another piece on the button of the month

1410
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,440
Speaker 4:  about a USB button that helped people win Jeopardy.

1411
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:31,800
Speaker 4:  It's delightful. And I want one just to like mute and unmute my microphone

1412
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:35,200
Speaker 4:  now. I have no use for it, but I want it. I, I want

1413
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:35,800
Speaker 2:  One real bad.

1414
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:39,880
Speaker 4:  The latest land of the Giants episode is out. It's about Tesla in China.

1415
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:42,280
Speaker 4:  It's very good. That whole season has been really great. Like Land of the

1416
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,760
Speaker 4:  Giants has always really great, but I actually think this might be my favorite

1417
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:48,200
Speaker 4:  season we've ever done. It's really good. Everybody just go listen to it.

1418
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:52,040
