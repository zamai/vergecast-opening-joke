Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, Alex Cranz, and David Pierce discuss this week's tech and gadget news.

2
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:07,195
Speaker 5:  Hello And Welcome to Vergecast the flagship podcast of David. Finally

3
00:01:07,195 --> 00:01:08,555
Speaker 5:  admitting it's just a three.

4
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:16,675
Speaker 5:  That's what we're known for here. Just being broken down

5
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:20,715
Speaker 5:  and saying, you know what three, I'm your friend Neli. This

6
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:21,915
Speaker 5:  is Alex Cranz. I'm thinking

7
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:22,595
Speaker 7:  What a two is.

8
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:24,355
Speaker 5:  That's on fire.

9
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:30,355
Speaker 5:  David Pierce is here. My The Verge is very own three. David Pierce.

10
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:32,555
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

11
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:34,835
Speaker 8:  That's, listen, I've heard worse, I'll take

12
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:37,915
Speaker 5:  It. No, David, you're attending all of our hearts,

13
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:40,395
Speaker 5:  especially now that you've admitted the truth

14
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:46,635
Speaker 5:  Lots. Talk about the show. David reviewed The Rabbit R one, which, that's

15
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:49,195
Speaker 5:  the whole show. That's two hours right there. Yeah. We have what we're calling

16
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:53,235
Speaker 5:  a money round. There's a bunch of money news to be talked

17
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:57,075
Speaker 5:  about, including LinkedIn adding games. When you think

18
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,675
Speaker 5:  about money, a bunch of gadget stuff. There's some Pixel eight A leaks, there's

19
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:04,075
Speaker 5:  an iPad event next week or what we assume is an iPad event next week.

20
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:06,915
Speaker 5:  We gotta talk about that. Can do some preview of that. And then of course

21
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:07,555
Speaker 5:  the lightning round.

22
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:10,875
Speaker 5:  The Verge is very enlightening round

23
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:14,555
Speaker 8:  Still woefully unsponsored, very upsetting.

24
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,395
Speaker 7:  Pixar should sponsor it.

25
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,115
Speaker 5:  Yeah. See any, any number of

26
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,115
Speaker 7:  Companies. Lightning the Queen Round. Come on. It's right there

27
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:24,395
Speaker 5:  As a man who for obvious financial reasons needs to

28
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,995
Speaker 5:  sell his raptor. The Ford Lightning is right there.

29
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:31,995
Speaker 5:  It's

30
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:32,795
Speaker 7:  True. Just right there.

31
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:36,115
Speaker 5:  Alex, I haven't talked to you about this yet. I, we, we have to get rid of

32
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:40,075
Speaker 5:  the pickup truck. It was my Mountain Adventure pandemic binky pickup truck.

33
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:40,595
Speaker 5:  And that's

34
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:42,675
Speaker 7:  Gotta go. And now you're like, you live far too close to New York now to

35
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:43,275
Speaker 7:  own a pickup truck

36
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:44,995
Speaker 5:  Basically. Yeah, it is incompatible with my neighborhood.

37
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:49,555
Speaker 7:  It's Can you, can you, like how many points is a turn in

38
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:50,075
Speaker 7:  in the street?

39
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:51,555
Speaker 5:  Oh, that's, I'm just knocking over houses.

40
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,595
Speaker 5:  I'm just like, whatever. I'll pay the fine.

41
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:57,955
Speaker 7:  It's fine. No one has a post off post box anymore.

42
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:02,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's all, it's all over. But I'm just saying we, we

43
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,125
Speaker 5:  didn't call it the wrapped around

44
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:07,925
Speaker 5:  we could Jim Farley, CEO Ford,

45
00:03:09,535 --> 00:03:12,125
Speaker 5:  who's clearly in charge of the podcast marketing budget,

46
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:16,525
Speaker 8:  We will name the lightning round after any car. That's, I'm not, I'm not

47
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:20,325
Speaker 8:  above that for a price. I would call this the Kia Forte round

48
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:21,605
Speaker 8:  and it would be no problem.

49
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:24,045
Speaker 7:  Okay, nevermind. Yeah, that's fine.

50
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,045
Speaker 5:  Again, the, the conceit of the lightning round is, it goes fast. It actually

51
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:29,925
Speaker 5:  never goes fast. Anyway, we're gonna get to it. The Kia

52
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:30,885
Speaker 8:  Forte round. I'm telling me

53
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:34,205
Speaker 5:  It, it's right there. That's a music term. I think that it

54
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:35,645
Speaker 7:  Goes. Okay. And then we have to this

55
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:39,605
Speaker 5:  If you can steal it to. We have, you can steal the lightning round,

56
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:44,885
Speaker 5:  but, but yeah, we're gonna be there in like 45 minutes. If you. If between

57
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:48,685
Speaker 5:  now and then you can convince your CMO to sponsor it. Give us a call. There

58
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:52,485
Speaker 5:  we go. Liam is waiting for you. Alright, let's start with the news. The

59
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:56,525
Speaker 5:  news. The Rabbit R one was released. David, you went to the

60
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:59,485
Speaker 5:  party, you talked about it last week on the show, how you felt about the

61
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:03,365
Speaker 5:  thing this week. You've written a review. I don't think if people in the

62
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:06,165
Speaker 5:  Vergecast audience are paying attention to the gadget ecosystem, I don't

63
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:10,045
Speaker 5:  think your review is surprising because there was no embargo. People

64
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:12,805
Speaker 5:  just got them. It was only people who bought them that had them. They were

65
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:16,125
Speaker 5:  just talking about it. The, the problems have been obvious the whole time,

66
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:19,405
Speaker 5:  but the, and I think Marquez was like, this product is almost

67
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:23,365
Speaker 5:  unreviewable. It is so broken. But you did it, you actually reviewed it,

68
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:27,045
Speaker 5:  you gave it the score. The whole, the full VERGE organized review

69
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:27,605
Speaker 5:  treatment.

70
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,245
Speaker 5:  It didn't seem to go well.

71
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:34,125
Speaker 8:  It didn't go well. It's been a very funny experience because I think

72
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:38,565
Speaker 8:  coming at this after the Humane experience, which was sort of a

73
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:42,445
Speaker 8:  normal like high-end gadget review experience where they give it to a

74
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:46,045
Speaker 8:  group of people, it's under embargo. It's a very sort of secretive thing.

75
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:49,765
Speaker 8:  People are not talking about it on social. There's like not tons of

76
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:53,085
Speaker 8:  sort of real time feedback coming from people. And then this comes out and

77
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:56,725
Speaker 8:  Rabbit just hands it out to hundreds. And then the day after, what seemed

78
00:04:56,725 --> 00:05:00,525
Speaker 8:  to be thousands of people, like I picked mine up at that event last Tuesday

79
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:04,445
Speaker 8:  night and people started getting theirs in the mail like on

80
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:08,165
Speaker 8:  Wednesday. And these are just users. Like I bought one, I

81
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:11,645
Speaker 8:  bought one in order to get it to review everybody who has one bought one.

82
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:15,685
Speaker 8:  And it turns out a bunch of people who have spent

83
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:19,365
Speaker 8:  months being really excited about this thing that has been super hyped as

84
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:22,845
Speaker 8:  like a cool way to use AI to get stuff done and feels like the future. And

85
00:05:22,845 --> 00:05:26,045
Speaker 8:  a Star Trek communicator. And then you take it out and you say, order me

86
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:29,925
Speaker 8:  a ride. And it says this app is gonna take a long time to load and then fails.

87
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,285
Speaker 8:  Turns out that sucks. And so it's been a really interesting experience over

88
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:38,045
Speaker 8:  the last, what, nine days since it came out, watching people

89
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:41,925
Speaker 8:  go through basically the same process I have, which is you start with, oh

90
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,165
Speaker 8:  this thing is fun, it's cute, it's whimsical, it's adorable. And then

91
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,725
Speaker 8:  you use it for a couple of very straightforward things and it does those

92
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:49,645
Speaker 8:  things. Okay.

93
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:55,245
Speaker 8:  For days it didn't know what time it was. Mine would tell me

94
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:59,405
Speaker 8:  the time if I asked, but it was, was three hours off. And because rabbit's

95
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:02,765
Speaker 8:  AI is like trying to be very clever, it wouldn't let you set the time zone

96
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,965
Speaker 8:  manually. It also you would ask at the weather and it would just invent

97
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:10,165
Speaker 8:  a place for it to be. There were a couple of people in the office at The

98
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:14,125
Speaker 8:  Verge who have seen this and were asking it. And I at one point asked three

99
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:18,085
Speaker 8:  times in a row sitting in my basement in Washington DC and it

100
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:20,365
Speaker 8:  gave me the weather for New York, Philadelphia and Budapest.

101
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:21,805
Speaker 5:  No, three

102
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:22,165
Speaker 8:  Times in

103
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:24,205
Speaker 5:  A row. The third one's a wild card. Yeah.

104
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:24,885
Speaker 8:  It's like, alright.

105
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:27,645
Speaker 5:  At least the other ones were former capitals of the United States.

106
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:29,685
Speaker 7:  Maybe it just really like

107
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:33,605
Speaker 5:  Budapest never, I think George Washington never went to Budapest as

108
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:34,165
Speaker 5:  far as I'm aware,

109
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:35,165
Speaker 8:  As far as I can tell. Yeah.

110
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:38,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I can't even think of what the, the similarity between those three

111
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:39,245
Speaker 7:  cities is.

112
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:43,285
Speaker 5:  Well I'm saying there is one. Three of them are former Capitals seats of

113
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:44,405
Speaker 5:  the United States government. Two of them.

114
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,605
Speaker 8:  No, no.

115
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:46,965
Speaker 5:  That that thing

116
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:50,925
Speaker 8:  You just did ascribes way too much thought and intelligence to what is

117
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:51,845
Speaker 8:  actually happening on this

118
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,965
Speaker 5:  Place. There're just places where Ben Franklin was hammered. That's fine.

119
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:58,885
Speaker 9:  Ben. Ben Franklin hammered in Bud. That's

120
00:06:58,885 --> 00:06:59,165
Speaker 5:  All I said.

121
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:05,405
Speaker 8:  But yeah, so I go through this whole process and, and by the, by the time

122
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:09,325
Speaker 8:  I'm actually sitting down to be like, what is the story of this

123
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,725
Speaker 8:  device? It's both that it is

124
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:17,565
Speaker 8:  so woefully under baked. Like they've been promising really

125
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:20,165
Speaker 8:  interesting stuff since the beginning. Right. And we, we made a lot of fun

126
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:24,005
Speaker 8:  of Humane for a year for just the weirdness of that device.

127
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:25,845
Speaker 8:  But Rabbit just kind of came out and they were just like, here's the thing,

128
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,605
Speaker 8:  here's what it does. It's a fun toy, it's $200. And it's like, okay, that

129
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:32,525
Speaker 8:  actually, that might be something. And they just didn't do it. Yeah. They

130
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:34,765
Speaker 8:  just didn't build the thing. They told us they were gonna build it.

131
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:38,765
Speaker 5:  So I'm gonna ask the same question I asked about the Humane pin, which

132
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:42,525
Speaker 5:  a lot of listeners have just been asking us as though we know

133
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:44,565
Speaker 5:  why did they ship this this way?

134
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:49,245
Speaker 8:  I I have a lot of theories about this. Yeah, I

135
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:53,205
Speaker 8:  don't, the answer is I don't know. And I, I will say the, the most

136
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:57,485
Speaker 8:  specific answer is I don't know why they shipped it now and not

137
00:07:57,545 --> 00:08:01,365
Speaker 8:  in three months. Like I can tell you why they shipped it now and not in 12

138
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:04,765
Speaker 8:  months because inventory is expensive. You have to make

139
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,765
Speaker 8:  decisions on what you buy and when way in advance.

140
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:13,045
Speaker 8:  And actually to like, make a bunch of stuff and then stick it in a warehouse

141
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:16,685
Speaker 8:  and then update it, repackage it and ship it is like wildly expensive.

142
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:20,685
Speaker 8:  And so the, like, once you've started the logistics train, it's really, really,

143
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:24,605
Speaker 8:  really hard to stop it. So I think that's the simplest reason. It's like

144
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:28,165
Speaker 8:  everybody made this date call a long time ago

145
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:32,845
Speaker 8:  and didn't finish building the thing before it had to ship. And

146
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,725
Speaker 8:  rather than eat the like very real cost of

147
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:40,445
Speaker 8:  delaying it a few months, they just shipped the unfinished thing and said

148
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:44,325
Speaker 8:  big stuff coming this summer. But both Humane and Rabbit have

149
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:48,365
Speaker 8:  been out there being like, oh yeah, tons of stuff coming. Jesse

150
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:52,085
Speaker 8:  Lou, the CEO of Rabbit stood in front of the screen showing the roadmap and

151
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:55,765
Speaker 8:  it has this big long list of stuff that absolutely needed to be there on

152
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:59,205
Speaker 8:  day one that is coming, quote unquote this summer, while I was using the

153
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,005
Speaker 8:  device on Tuesday, they shipped a big software update that

154
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:06,965
Speaker 8:  fixed the time zone thing. So my Rabbit now reliably knows what time it

155
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:10,005
Speaker 8:  is, which is very exciting and like kind of fixed the weather. It doesn't

156
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:13,525
Speaker 8:  give me Budapest anymore, but it also gives me like 20 miles from my house.

157
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:18,205
Speaker 8:  So we're like, we're getting there and that, but that's the kind of stuff,

158
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:22,045
Speaker 8:  oh, it also fixed the unbelievably disastrous battery life that

159
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:25,845
Speaker 8:  this thing had. Like if I sat here and just used it for 60 minutes, it

160
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:29,485
Speaker 8:  died. And if I just turned it on, put it on my desk and didn't touch it,

161
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,205
Speaker 8:  it would die in six hours. It, I mean it was unbelievably bad

162
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:37,205
Speaker 8:  and it's much better now. The the, it still is like a one day

163
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:40,845
Speaker 8:  device. Even If, you don't touch it at all, which is still pretty bad, but

164
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:44,685
Speaker 8:  it's better. But this is the stuff that is just like literally inexcusable

165
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:48,565
Speaker 8:  to ship to people who paid for your device. And

166
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:53,045
Speaker 8:  I'm, I'm sensitive to all of the business reasons that that is hard to

167
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:56,885
Speaker 8:  guess. AI's changing really fast. These companies don't have infinite

168
00:09:56,885 --> 00:10:00,685
Speaker 8:  amounts of money and supply chain victories. But you

169
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:02,125
Speaker 8:  just can't, you just can't do it.

170
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:06,285
Speaker 7:  I mean, people have lobbed a lot of like really negative

171
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,725
Speaker 7:  assessments at Jesse Lou since this thing came out and has been kind of a

172
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,605
Speaker 7:  boondoggle for him, right? Like a lot of people are bringing resurfacing

173
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:17,485
Speaker 7:  the fact that he was formerly CEO of a company that promised NFTs

174
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:18,085
Speaker 7:  in the Metaverse

175
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:23,485
Speaker 7:  didn't deliver on that and then kind of moved over, which is not a,

176
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:27,325
Speaker 7:  not a really great look for him. And, and it is just like,

177
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:31,205
Speaker 7:  and I've heard, I've heard the accusations on Reddit just flying fast,

178
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:34,525
Speaker 7:  right? Saying that, that this was a grift, that everybody was just kind of

179
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:38,245
Speaker 7:  like misled into this thing that was clearly like a beta product

180
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:41,885
Speaker 7:  that they had no intention of thinking was real. And I don't, like, there's

181
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:44,765
Speaker 7:  no reporting behind any of this. This is just rumors, but the rumors are

182
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:45,245
Speaker 7:  furious.

183
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:49,925
Speaker 8:  Yeah. The, like Jesse is a grifter thing is a very real

184
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:53,805
Speaker 8:  thing that is floating out there. I think I, I forget what the name of the

185
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:57,125
Speaker 8:  law is, but it's never ascribed to malice what can be described by

186
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,205
Speaker 8:  incompetence. Right? Like that's what this is to me. Yeah. Like this is just

187
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:03,885
Speaker 8:  a startup that made a bunch of really big promises and didn't pull it off

188
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,565
Speaker 8:  that explains everything that is happening here. Right. Whether, and I think

189
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:10,765
Speaker 8:  frankly like that was the NFT thing. Everybody got really excited about this

190
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:12,245
Speaker 8:  huge thing that was happening. Thought it was gonna be really

191
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:14,285
Speaker 5:  Cool, thought they could buy it. No, that was grifting that I just,

192
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:15,005
Speaker 8:  Some of it was

193
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:18,445
Speaker 5:  Grifting that almost all of it. I just came from an event where they had

194
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,365
Speaker 5:  an NFT wall and everyone was like, ew.

195
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,645
Speaker 5:  Sure. Like were like

196
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:25,405
Speaker 8:  Now a lot of people

197
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:26,365
Speaker 5:  Were not. But back then

198
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:27,565
Speaker 8:  Saying you back then back I,

199
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:28,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah, because they're at the top of the pyramid.

200
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:32,485
Speaker 5:  I mean we were, I would, yes, I would point out that The Verge staff almost

201
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:33,445
Speaker 5:  universally was saying

202
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:34,325
Speaker 8:  Yes. Oh, I agree.

203
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:37,725
Speaker 5:  You. And then there was Richard Lawler who was saying you, but also in a

204
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:41,645
Speaker 5:  way that suggested I told you so. Like he, he was like pre I tell, I told

205
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:42,005
Speaker 5:  you so

206
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:44,725
Speaker 7:  Before they even announced what NFT meant. Yeah. Richard was

207
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:45,605
Speaker 5:  Like, I told you. So

208
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:51,845
Speaker 5:  those were the two reactions on our staff. Look, I I I

209
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:55,645
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm much more inclined to believe this is some Yeah. Like hardware

210
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:59,245
Speaker 5:  startup disaster at 1 99. It's like hard to grift

211
00:11:59,245 --> 00:11:59,645
Speaker 5:  anyone.

212
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:02,565
Speaker 7:  Well, I mean if you're, if you're broke ass and you were like, this is gonna

213
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:06,125
Speaker 7:  be my cool gadget. Yeah. At 1 99, like, like a lot. Some people

214
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:09,365
Speaker 5:  I'm just saying if If you, if you're like in the Grifter game, you're, you're

215
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:12,605
Speaker 5:  trying to make more money than that's Yeah. At a pop. You know, the thing

216
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:15,685
Speaker 5:  that gets me is a lot of that conversation is related to

217
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:20,045
Speaker 5:  just the reality of these products. There were teardowns of the Humane AI

218
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:23,965
Speaker 5:  pin and The Rabbit R one from, I fix it this week. They're Android phones.

219
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:28,205
Speaker 5:  That's what they are. And people took that to be a

220
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,085
Speaker 5:  sign of the Grift.

221
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:30,445
Speaker 7:  That's not a

222
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:33,965
Speaker 5:  Sign. This thing is just running Android on a chip set that you can get

223
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:35,085
Speaker 5:  the Rabbit,

224
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:35,885
Speaker 7:  But so is your tv.

225
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:39,925
Speaker 5:  Right. But the and the Rabbit interface is really just an Android app and

226
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,125
Speaker 5:  you like smash those ideas together. Like this thing is broken, doesn't quite

227
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,325
Speaker 5:  work and it's really just Android phone. This is a grift and I, I think it's

228
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:50,445
Speaker 5:  actually quite important to pull those ideas apart. I agree. Because

229
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:53,365
Speaker 5:  like you just said, Alex almost everything is an Android phone.

230
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:55,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Like your fridge probably is also an Android phone.

231
00:12:56,135 --> 00:13:00,045
Speaker 5:  Everything is a time bomb. Everything is just

232
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,285
Speaker 5:  waiting to unleash Bixby upon you. Everything

233
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:04,285
Speaker 7:  Can run an a PK If. you try hard enough.

234
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:07,885
Speaker 5:  That's actually what whatever that, that's a law. Yeah. Alex's

235
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:08,845
Speaker 7:  Law, that's Alex's

236
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:12,325
Speaker 5:  Law. You can horsepower an AP k in almost anything these days. It would be

237
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:16,205
Speaker 5:  shocking to me if this thing wasn't running Android or

238
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:20,205
Speaker 5:  some commodity smartphone hard. Like that's what's cheap

239
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:24,165
Speaker 5:  at a, at a buck 99. Again, like maybe an

240
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:28,005
Speaker 5:  easier thing for them to have done would've been to buy a bunch of like

241
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:31,605
Speaker 5:  used Galaxy AER phones and put their app on it

242
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:35,325
Speaker 5:  because then at least they would've told the time reliably. Well

243
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:38,565
Speaker 5:  like it's, it's weird. Like the thing that I can't quite wrap my head around

244
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:42,245
Speaker 5:  is like if you're gonna build on top of the existing thing, which almost

245
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:46,125
Speaker 5:  everybody does, why didn't you get the easy parts for free?

246
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:51,085
Speaker 5:  Like why didn't you get, I know what time it is or I can do a GPS

247
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:54,805
Speaker 5:  lookup to pull the weather. That stuff is all in the operating

248
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:58,485
Speaker 5:  system. Yeah. Like not being able to tell the time is actually like I can't

249
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:01,845
Speaker 5:  quite wrap my head around. Even If you install like

250
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:06,245
Speaker 5:  the most open source version of A OSP Android open source

251
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,605
Speaker 5:  project on the most open dev hardware that exists.

252
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:14,365
Speaker 5:  It's not like clock doesn't come for the ride. Yeah. And

253
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:18,085
Speaker 5:  that's the part I don't get. It's like all the energy got focused on the

254
00:14:18,085 --> 00:14:20,525
Speaker 5:  hard part and they didn't take the free stuff for free. Yeah.

255
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:24,205
Speaker 7:  It was like they're doing too much. Like nobody was there just going, no,

256
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:27,845
Speaker 7:  y'all we're doing too much. Let's, let's just, let's scale it back. We got

257
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:31,645
Speaker 7:  this really kick ass hardware. 'cause like in in your piece you talked about

258
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:34,685
Speaker 7:  it that the hardware is is is nice. It's, it's cool.

259
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:38,805
Speaker 7:  I tried one this week. It was really cool to handle. I expected the buttons

260
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:42,645
Speaker 7:  to be more, I expected everything to be softer. Yeah. Like the soft touch

261
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:45,485
Speaker 7:  plastic. But it wasn't, that was a bummer. I forgot where I was

262
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:49,005
Speaker 5:  Going. My new startup is 100% buying used Galaxy Aeries phones

263
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:52,845
Speaker 5:  installing chat GPT on them and being like, this is the future. Yeah. Which

264
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:56,645
Speaker 5:  is more or less the piece Allison wrote this week. Right, right. But that's

265
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,525
Speaker 5:  the part. David, did they talk to you about this? Has Jesse said anything

266
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:03,045
Speaker 5:  about it? I know they put out one statement in response to people

267
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:07,125
Speaker 5:  leaking their A PK saying like, this isn't gonna work on your Android

268
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:11,085
Speaker 5:  phone calls, our cloud services, our open sourced version

269
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:14,685
Speaker 5:  of Android is heavily custom. All the stuff you would say. But there's just

270
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:18,085
Speaker 5:  a part where like not getting the basics for free is just really weird To

271
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:18,725
Speaker 5:  me. There's

272
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:22,685
Speaker 8:  A real fake it till you make it thing happening with this that I think

273
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:26,645
Speaker 8:  is what a lot of people on the internet are responding to. Right. Like would

274
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:30,565
Speaker 8:  that, that quote unquote source code leak basically showed that

275
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:34,045
Speaker 8:  rather than use some fancy AI thing,

276
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:37,565
Speaker 8:  Rabbit is actually just using this software called playwright, which is a

277
00:15:37,565 --> 00:15:41,045
Speaker 8:  very well-known automation software. It's like If. you have a website that

278
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:44,965
Speaker 8:  you want tested out to see what works and what doesn't. And if all the

279
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:47,805
Speaker 8:  links go to the right place and so on and so forth. That's just like a thing

280
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:51,405
Speaker 8:  a business can run. I think it's owned by Microsoft. This is well-known

281
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:55,645
Speaker 8:  technology. It is like not hard to teach a computer to use a website.

282
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:59,525
Speaker 8:  Right. And and the idea that that's all Rabbit is doing really rubbed some

283
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,445
Speaker 8:  people the wrong way. But I think in general these

284
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:07,125
Speaker 8:  companies feel like they have to do the whole thing and really

285
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:11,325
Speaker 8:  reinvent the wheel or else you're just a smartphone and, and

286
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:15,085
Speaker 8:  we're in this moment now where I think the

287
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:18,285
Speaker 8:  next phase of this will be starting to push the two things back towards each

288
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:21,765
Speaker 8:  other a little bit more. We're gonna get smartphones that do more sort of

289
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:25,325
Speaker 8:  one touch AI stuff. We're gonna get devices that are more connected to your

290
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:29,125
Speaker 8:  phone. But if I'm Rabbit or Humane, you rewind

291
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,845
Speaker 8:  even a couple of years and what they're all saying is we have to do our own

292
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:36,005
Speaker 8:  thing, build our own platform, own the whole experience ourselves. Because

293
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:39,405
Speaker 8:  that's the only way for us to be successful. And I think If, you start with

294
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:43,325
Speaker 8:  that assumption. That is how you run into Holy

295
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:47,165
Speaker 8:  God, this is so much harder to do all of this than we thought. And it's how

296
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:50,925
Speaker 8:  you end up with devices like these. Like I think you can't take the Android

297
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:53,765
Speaker 8:  clock because people look at it and be like, that's the Android clock. Why

298
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:54,605
Speaker 8:  don't I just use my phone?

299
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:57,005
Speaker 5:  You could just not show the clock to people. Yeah. You

300
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:58,685
Speaker 7:  Change the ui. The Yeah.

301
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:03,125
Speaker 5:  I'm not talking about the old HTC flippy clock widget. Although if they

302
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,405
Speaker 5:  brought that back, that would be sick. That would be sick. It, I mean that

303
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:09,885
Speaker 5:  thing was iconic. So good. What is the most iconic Android widget of all

304
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:13,325
Speaker 5:  time? It's the HTC flippy clock. You cannot convince me otherwise. I would

305
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:16,485
Speaker 5:  agree. Or the circle clock from the T-Mobile G one. No, no, it's

306
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:16,845
Speaker 7:  The flippy

307
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:17,885
Speaker 5:  Clock. The flippy clock. Yeah.

308
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:21,565
Speaker 7:  When I think Android I think of that with like the background and everything

309
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:21,685
Speaker 7:  they

310
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:24,805
Speaker 5:  Had. Yeah. That weird cartoony vibe. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh beautiful.

311
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:27,525
Speaker 5:  Let's just talk about all the Android phones now and how you could start

312
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:31,365
Speaker 5:  a start shipping little Android phones. But honestly I think

313
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:34,205
Speaker 5:  part of that is related, right? You're two years ago you're starting this

314
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:37,325
Speaker 5:  thing. You could say, all right, we're gonna ship an AI app

315
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:42,205
Speaker 5:  for people's phones and then you're run right into and then Apple and Google

316
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:44,445
Speaker 5:  won't let us 'cause that threatens their business. Right?

317
00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:48,445
Speaker 8:  Right. And we're now in literal direct, exact precise competition with

318
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:51,325
Speaker 8:  those companies and the other best funded companies on planet earth.

319
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:55,245
Speaker 5:  Right. But now you can, like all the antitrust, that stuff that has happened,

320
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:00,005
Speaker 5:  alternative app stores, all this stuff. Now you can, like I kind of fully

321
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:02,725
Speaker 5:  expect to see a wave of startups that are like

322
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:05,005
Speaker 5:  Rabbit but an app.

323
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:06,165
Speaker 8:  Hmm.

324
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:09,605
Speaker 5:  Right. Without all the hardware noise to say like, look, you can just run

325
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:12,365
Speaker 5:  this on iPhone now 'cause Apple can't stop me. Or at least in the eu

326
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:15,965
Speaker 5:  I don't, you know, I don't know what's gonna happen with Google in that particular

327
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:19,445
Speaker 5:  way, but at least in the eu, apple now has to allow these alternative app

328
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:22,525
Speaker 5:  stores all stuff. And that is interesting to me. I dunno if it'll work, I

329
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:26,365
Speaker 5:  dunno if Apple's just gonna Sherlock everybody at WWC this year. But it

330
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:30,165
Speaker 5:  feels like the Rabbit and the Humane caught a moment and a vibe when they

331
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:33,925
Speaker 5:  were, no one could build an app like this on the app. Like Apple just

332
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:36,325
Speaker 5:  wouldn't let you ship that app. I'm confident,

333
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:40,485
Speaker 5:  especially 'cause they probably buy stuff and Apple wouldn't get a cut of

334
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:43,365
Speaker 5:  that money. Like there's a million reasons why Apple wouldn't let you ship

335
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:43,685
Speaker 5:  that app.

336
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:44,965
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think that's right. Well

337
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:47,525
Speaker 7:  Also it would've been a crappy app. Like

338
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:48,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It wouldn't have worked for

339
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:52,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Right. Like, like the, the the the talent and, and what we really saw

340
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:55,965
Speaker 7:  the real success of the R one, the reason it's a three

341
00:18:56,785 --> 00:19:00,525
Speaker 7:  and not a one or a two is because the hardware is nice.

342
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:04,005
Speaker 7:  Like because the hardware is Yeah. Like they, they did this go and the user

343
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:07,645
Speaker 7:  interface is pretty, it's not always pleasant. Yeah, it's fine.

344
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:09,325
Speaker 7:  Yeah. But

345
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:10,605
Speaker 8:  It's like, it's fine. Yeah, it's fine. But

346
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:13,365
Speaker 7:  No, you're right. Yeah. Right. Like, like there was some some genuinely good

347
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:17,285
Speaker 7:  stuff there and it one had nothing to do with Rabbit. It frankly seems

348
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:20,845
Speaker 7:  primarily a teenage engineering did the good parts and,

349
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:25,005
Speaker 7:  and Yeah. Why like they just never would've made it as an app. Yeah.

350
00:19:25,345 --> 00:19:29,285
Speaker 7:  And their whole, their whole thing was we wanna be the next Apple, which

351
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:33,165
Speaker 7:  is enormously ambitious on, on an an easy day and

352
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:37,045
Speaker 7:  and their climate is like godly ambitious.

353
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:42,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The fact that DoorDash just doesn't work on this thing and

354
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:44,685
Speaker 5:  Uber just doesn't work and Spotify is broken. It's like

355
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:49,845
Speaker 5:  you're Yeah. You could say it could, it should just be an app. But those

356
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:53,805
Speaker 5:  apps tend to work on phones. Yeah. But you can get food

357
00:19:53,915 --> 00:19:56,925
Speaker 5:  from DoorDash on phones. You, you pretty

358
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:57,365
Speaker 8:  Successfully

359
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:00,725
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent of the time. DoorDash is like here your order is completed.

360
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:04,405
Speaker 5:  The fact that they shipped it broken with those integrations.

361
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:08,605
Speaker 5:  Jesse, I think he tweeted, he's like, my hope for this round of reviews is

362
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:12,485
Speaker 5:  a six. He actually tweeted the number that you was opening and it's

363
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:13,445
Speaker 5:  like, wow,

364
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:16,605
Speaker 7:  Did you use your product before you shipped it?

365
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:20,805
Speaker 5:  Like not giving yourself the seven is incredible. Right.

366
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:23,285
Speaker 5:  You're like world of no sevens. I'm not an eight, I'm a six.

367
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:24,725
Speaker 8:  It's tough. That's

368
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:25,245
Speaker 5:  Rough.

369
00:20:25,675 --> 00:20:29,445
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Well I think about it like the Phil Libin who used to be the,

370
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:33,285
Speaker 8:  the CEO of Evernote and then was an investor now running, which is that cool

371
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,205
Speaker 8:  like video chat app. He said to me once a couple of years

372
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:39,605
Speaker 8:  ago, and I may have said this on the show before, but I think about it all

373
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:43,005
Speaker 8:  the time. He said, when I look at a product, my question is always

374
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:47,445
Speaker 8:  is this primitive or is this stupid? Because you can't fix

375
00:20:47,465 --> 00:20:51,365
Speaker 8:  stupid, but primitive usually gets better. Right? He was like, if

376
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:54,885
Speaker 8:  If you and he was like the, the first iPhone like perfect, primitive, the

377
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:57,965
Speaker 8:  thing barely worked. But the minute you looked at it you were like, oh there

378
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,685
Speaker 8:  is, there is something inside of this. But if he was like, if I don't have

379
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:05,525
Speaker 8:  that reaction to this, if there is no

380
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:09,285
Speaker 8:  good version of this, it's just stupid. And I think where

381
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:12,695
Speaker 8:  I've come to is like, I think Rabbit

382
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:17,175
Speaker 8:  might be stupid in a way that I think Humane is just kind of primitive. Right.

383
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:20,055
Speaker 8:  Really. And I'm happy to have this argument with you and I would love to

384
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:23,535
Speaker 8:  have this argument with you. Yeah. I am still convinced that the idea of

385
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:27,695
Speaker 8:  a like an a wearable on body device that is

386
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:31,495
Speaker 8:  easier to access than your phone is something, I don't know how big that

387
00:21:31,495 --> 00:21:34,135
Speaker 8:  something is gonna be. I would bet money it doesn't have a laser projector

388
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:38,335
Speaker 8:  involved at all. But like there is, there is some teeny tiny nugget of

389
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:42,735
Speaker 8:  AI wearable that I still find compelling. A handheld device

390
00:21:43,765 --> 00:21:47,455
Speaker 8:  that isn't my phone that does everything my phone tries to do, but worse

391
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,935
Speaker 8:  I don't see it. And and there maybe there is some technological

392
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:56,175
Speaker 8:  AI miracle coming that makes these like large action model agents

393
00:21:56,245 --> 00:22:00,175
Speaker 8:  work. And if so I look forward to being proven wrong on

394
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:03,895
Speaker 8:  this one. But like I don't see the runway for the R

395
00:22:03,995 --> 00:22:07,135
Speaker 8:  one from what it is now to something that is like

396
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:11,735
Speaker 8:  genuinely interesting and different from my phone. So

397
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:14,055
Speaker 8:  that I will carry both of them. I just don't see it. Let

398
00:22:14,055 --> 00:22:17,495
Speaker 5:  Me pull apart one idea in there and then I can disagree with you about the

399
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:21,015
Speaker 5:  rest. Okay. You mentioned large action models, which we have not really talked

400
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:23,855
Speaker 5:  about in the context of the R one, but when you think about these products

401
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:27,055
Speaker 5:  and how their companies are talking about them, Humane

402
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:30,615
Speaker 5:  are a bunch of stargazy, Naval Gazy

403
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:35,175
Speaker 5:  phones are ruining your life. Yeah. Right. Like just

404
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:39,135
Speaker 5:  stuff, just whatever, whatever that vibe is from Humane

405
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:43,575
Speaker 5:  big thinks thought leader stuff. Rabbit

406
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:47,455
Speaker 5:  is like, we made a large action model that we'll use computers for you on

407
00:22:47,455 --> 00:22:51,295
Speaker 5:  your behalf, If, you give us your long end information, which is a very

408
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:55,215
Speaker 5:  like small idea in practicality.

409
00:22:55,445 --> 00:22:59,255
Speaker 5:  It's a huge idea in the world, right? Right. It's the idea of you will have

410
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:02,495
Speaker 5:  an agent, but the actual idea is really quite small, which is why they could

411
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:06,175
Speaker 5:  fake it with playwright, which is just like user

412
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:09,655
Speaker 5:  testing software, right? Yeah. They're running a bot farm, they got a hundred

413
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:13,815
Speaker 5:  sausages waving at a hundred Android phones somewhere just used in computers

414
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:14,575
Speaker 5:  for you. I

415
00:23:14,575 --> 00:23:18,255
Speaker 8:  Mean like that is so much closer to true than it should be. Like I just

416
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:22,255
Speaker 8:  like, that's a joke. But you're not all that far from describing

417
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:24,095
Speaker 8:  what Rabbit is actually doing here. What,

418
00:23:24,585 --> 00:23:28,535
Speaker 5:  Right. But I'm saying on the, on the, on the split, right? If you,

419
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:30,935
Speaker 5:  if your idea is

420
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:36,775
Speaker 5:  is it primitive or stupid, the idea that okay, we're gonna automate the use

421
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:40,375
Speaker 5:  of a bunch of websites and we're starting with like a commercially existing

422
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:43,895
Speaker 5:  tool that already automates websites for you and we're gonna just try to

423
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:47,245
Speaker 5:  like fake it there until this large action model idea is ready. And then

424
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:50,165
Speaker 5:  we're just like gonna do a bunch of computer vision and horsepower our way

425
00:23:50,165 --> 00:23:50,565
Speaker 5:  through the web.

426
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:55,645
Speaker 5:  Sure. That's the point. Right. But they're nowhere on that journey

427
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:59,765
Speaker 5:  except to have used some commercially available like user testing

428
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:03,725
Speaker 8:  Software poorly. But I would add like they attempted to use it but they didn't

429
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:06,925
Speaker 8:  do it. And that, that's where I land. Right. It's not there, there's one

430
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:09,645
Speaker 8:  thing where it's like, okay, we, we tried to do something and didn't quite

431
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:12,885
Speaker 8:  do it and then there's another one that's we promised you we we were gonna

432
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:16,285
Speaker 8:  do it and just didn't. And like yeah, that's, that's pretty hard to come

433
00:24:16,285 --> 00:24:16,565
Speaker 8:  back from.

434
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:20,125
Speaker 5:  And then, but I'm saying then what Humane is selling is like you do not need

435
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:23,885
Speaker 5:  a phone. Your phone's killing you and we know it 'cause we

436
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:28,165
Speaker 5:  invented it. Which is an amazing thing. Beautiful. That's, you want to

437
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,805
Speaker 5:  be there, you're like those cigarettes were ruining you. I know this 'cause

438
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:32,045
Speaker 5:  I am Doctor Tobacco,

439
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:37,485
Speaker 5:  Please try this. Juul, which is the story of Juul, right? A

440
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:39,485
Speaker 5:  hundred percent. by the way, the story of JUUL is they hired a bunch of tobacco

441
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:39,965
Speaker 5:  scientists,

442
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:45,045
Speaker 5:  but Humane is like, we're we got you hooked and now we're gonna break it

443
00:24:45,105 --> 00:24:49,045
Speaker 5:  by selling you our pin. That

444
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:51,645
Speaker 5:  promise is like even more nascent, right? Like the technology doesn't work,

445
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:54,765
Speaker 5:  but it also might be the wrong promise. That's like what I'm hammering on

446
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:58,685
Speaker 5:  here, right? Like the idea of the software agent will go use software in

447
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:02,405
Speaker 5:  your behalf seems more achievable than

448
00:25:02,855 --> 00:25:04,605
Speaker 5:  we're gonna fully replace your phone.

449
00:25:05,465 --> 00:25:09,205
Speaker 8:  Oh, I think that's right. I, I think I have in the course

450
00:25:09,345 --> 00:25:13,005
Speaker 8:  of several weeks of talking to people kind of in and around Humane and

451
00:25:13,005 --> 00:25:16,805
Speaker 8:  reviewing this device, I think even Humane is

452
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:21,605
Speaker 8:  slowly starting to give up on that vision. Interesting. I I think If,

453
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:25,405
Speaker 8:  you gave them a time machine and let them go back 12 months ago, they would

454
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:29,315
Speaker 8:  not start to tell the story about how your phone is killing you

455
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:32,195
Speaker 8:  and we need to take away from your phone. I think they

456
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:36,395
Speaker 8:  realize how deeply weird their entire

457
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:41,035
Speaker 8:  like marketing strategy was for a long time. And even If, you look at what

458
00:25:41,035 --> 00:25:44,885
Speaker 8:  they've done publicly, like they've tried to sort of chill a little bit,

459
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:48,045
Speaker 8:  which I think is been good. But again, I, I do agree and this is, I think

460
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:51,165
Speaker 8:  the most consistent piece of feedback we get every time we cover one of these

461
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:54,845
Speaker 8:  devices is people saying, why would I use this over my phone? And the answer

462
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:58,765
Speaker 8:  is, you wouldn't and you're not going to anytime soon. And that just

463
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:02,245
Speaker 8:  is what it is. Right? And so I think if, if we just assume that as like ground

464
00:26:02,255 --> 00:26:05,765
Speaker 8:  truth and at this point I do. Right. And I think that's why the Humane

465
00:26:06,495 --> 00:26:10,045
Speaker 8:  price is so absurd. 6 99 plus a subscription

466
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:12,925
Speaker 8:  for a phone number and a text messaging system,

467
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:17,005
Speaker 8:  neither of which are attached to your actual phone number is like preposterous,

468
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:20,805
Speaker 8:  but still like boil it down even further. And it's just like the thing that

469
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:24,445
Speaker 8:  device is seems closer to being something to me

470
00:26:24,795 --> 00:26:26,405
Speaker 8:  than what the R one is.

471
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:30,165
Speaker 7:  I I just, I think they're both stupid.

472
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:32,325
Speaker 8:  That honestly might be Yeah.

473
00:26:32,485 --> 00:26:34,965
Speaker 7:  Like, like I think like, like I don't think either one is primitive. I think

474
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:35,205
Speaker 7:  they're both,

475
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:38,045
Speaker 5:  I think David is just trying to justify giving one a four and one a three.

476
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:41,245
Speaker 7:  No, I, I get, I totally understand the three and the four. I was telling

477
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:44,885
Speaker 7:  somebody at the office earlier today 'cause I edited that review and I looked

478
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:48,685
Speaker 7:  at that through and I was like, Hmm, well you know, the Humane pen like promised

479
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:51,365
Speaker 7:  a bunch of stuff and badly delivered

480
00:26:52,505 --> 00:26:55,445
Speaker 7:  Rabbit promised a bunch of stuff and didn't deliver at

481
00:26:55,445 --> 00:26:56,365
Speaker 5:  All and nothing didn't do

482
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,005
Speaker 8:  Any of it, but it

483
00:26:57,005 --> 00:27:00,925
Speaker 7:  Didn't catch on fire or physically harm David. That's

484
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:01,325
Speaker 8:  True. True.

485
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:02,925
Speaker 5:  I feel like we gotta recalibrate.

486
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:07,285
Speaker 8:  No, I think, I think you could make a fair argument that they both should

487
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:09,845
Speaker 8:  have been threes. There's no Yeah. Version of the argument that they both

488
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:12,605
Speaker 8:  should have been four, which is why I gave it a three. Like I, there's no,

489
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:17,245
Speaker 8:  I I hemmed and hawed on the AI pin and this one was easier. And

490
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:21,005
Speaker 8:  frankly, I think that simplest way to look at it is just

491
00:27:21,005 --> 00:27:24,845
Speaker 8:  price and realistically for what these things do, they're both

492
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:28,965
Speaker 8:  too expensive. And I think what $200 means to somebody versus what $700

493
00:27:28,965 --> 00:27:32,125
Speaker 8:  means to somebody, I don't know if you're buying one of these things, you

494
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:36,045
Speaker 8:  have disposable income anyway. Like, I don't know. I am perfectly

495
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:38,565
Speaker 8:  happy for everyone to yell at me about the score. I feel very good about

496
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:39,125
Speaker 8:  this score.

497
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:42,765
Speaker 5:  I feel fine about this score. Yeah. What I'm getting at is the, the Rabbit,

498
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:46,685
Speaker 5:  it's like a toy, right? It's 1 99. You can have it, it's broken. I buy so

499
00:27:46,685 --> 00:27:50,485
Speaker 5:  much broken tech garbage all the time. Same. Sure. But the

500
00:27:50,595 --> 00:27:52,645
Speaker 5:  idea of the human that you're gonna wear it, it's gonna be in your body.

501
00:27:52,645 --> 00:27:54,885
Speaker 5:  This is the part where it's just like disagree with you. Right. That's fine.

502
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:57,325
Speaker 5:  Like, I think that will just be a watch.

503
00:27:58,025 --> 00:27:58,245
Speaker 7:  Yes.

504
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:01,965
Speaker 5:  I, if any, if it's gonna be anything else, it'll be the meta glasses.

505
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:07,165
Speaker 5:  But like the little Star Trek communicator badge on my

506
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:11,085
Speaker 5:  curve of wearable bullshit, it's like, boy, I better hope

507
00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:12,685
Speaker 5:  I'm wearing a shirt today. That's like,

508
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:15,405
Speaker 7:  Star Trek exists in a world where there are no toilets.

509
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:19,125
Speaker 5:  I'm also always wearing a shirt. I dunno why I picked that one. Like, I'm

510
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,685
Speaker 5:  not, like, I'm not doing Baywatch, you know,

511
00:28:23,115 --> 00:28:23,645
Speaker 7:  Slow run

512
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:28,085
Speaker 5:  Run. But it's just like that thing, like, it, it is demanding in a

513
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:31,285
Speaker 5:  particular way that you adjust your wardrobe around it.

514
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:36,125
Speaker 5:  And I, there's just a part of me, it's like that's the part that's destined

515
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,645
Speaker 5:  to fail maybe, right? Is it, it goes here

516
00:28:39,015 --> 00:28:42,165
Speaker 8:  Maybe. I think the answer is it's gonna be lots of things. Like I, I think,

517
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:45,085
Speaker 8:  I think a watch is gonna work for lots of people. I think glasses will work

518
00:28:45,085 --> 00:28:47,565
Speaker 8:  for some people. They're not gonna work for me as somebody who doesn't wear

519
00:28:47,565 --> 00:28:50,725
Speaker 8:  glasses or contact, the idea of wearing a pair of glasses all day is just

520
00:28:50,765 --> 00:28:52,845
Speaker 8:  a non-starter for me. Like, I'm not gonna do it.

521
00:28:53,185 --> 00:28:56,165
Speaker 7:  All right, Mr. Fancy pants with the nice eyeballs. Yeah,

522
00:28:56,165 --> 00:28:57,845
Speaker 8:  It's good. Sorry. Sorry y'all.

523
00:28:58,065 --> 00:29:00,085
Speaker 5:  The next time I see you I'm shining my iPhone flashlight.

524
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:05,285
Speaker 5:  I dunno if that's gonna hurt you or anything. I just, just just will feel

525
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,245
Speaker 5:  good. Yeah, I appreciate

526
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,325
Speaker 8:  That. But no, I think, I think the answer can be lots of things, right? And

527
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:14,285
Speaker 8:  I, I think the, the, like the breast pin communicator thing is

528
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:18,125
Speaker 8:  also kind of weird. My honest bet is that the first thing

529
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:22,005
Speaker 8:  is gonna be headphones. Like I really sincerely believe that we're due for

530
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:25,245
Speaker 8:  like a giant explosion of AI stuff into your headphones

531
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:29,045
Speaker 8:  and it's gonna solve a lot of problems. Apple is, I think we're gonna get

532
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:29,405
Speaker 8:  to that faster.

533
00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:31,285
Speaker 7:  Taking notes as you say that,

534
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:35,205
Speaker 8:  I said this on Tuesday's show, but my absolutely baseless unreported conspiracy

535
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:39,045
Speaker 8:  theory is that the AirPods Max are going to be AI products. And

536
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:40,725
Speaker 8:  that's why it's been so long since they've been updated.

537
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,010
Speaker 7:  Oh no. It's gonna be the pros.

538
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,165
Speaker 8:  Yeah. No, the maxes are big. They can have a big battery.

539
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:49,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah. But I like, I, I don't know, I I, I remember the first time I put in

540
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:53,765
Speaker 7:  AirPod Pros and I like just asked my phone to do something through the

541
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:56,725
Speaker 7:  headphones and I was like, oh, this is magic. And like If, you can do that

542
00:29:56,875 --> 00:30:00,005
Speaker 7:  like consistently and regularly. But I think also

543
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:04,525
Speaker 7:  to the other, to If, you pull that out further, what we were all really seeking

544
00:30:04,665 --> 00:30:06,445
Speaker 7:  is a, a voice assistant.

545
00:30:07,115 --> 00:30:07,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

546
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:11,245
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And like, like AI is the buzzword, but actually we're just all

547
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:15,165
Speaker 7:  revisiting the voice assistant. And, and the R one does it

548
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:19,245
Speaker 7:  horribly, like sassy, the R one is so

549
00:30:19,655 --> 00:30:23,325
Speaker 7:  sassy. Every time I asked it something it was like, hold on, let me think

550
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:27,125
Speaker 7:  about it. And I'm like, well, I paid for you. I mean, I didn't Parker did,

551
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:27,885
Speaker 7:  but still

552
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:31,245
Speaker 5:  Wow. Wow. I paid Chop chopped, I paid

553
00:30:32,225 --> 00:30:34,245
Speaker 5:  get Nightmare restaurant customer chop. I

554
00:30:34,245 --> 00:30:34,925
Speaker 7:  Am absolutely

555
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:38,245
Speaker 8:  Paid for this. One of my favorites is when you ask it to do something it

556
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:41,765
Speaker 8:  can't do normally it'll say like, I'm unable to do that. And then every once

557
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:44,405
Speaker 8:  in a while it will just say, I cannot set a timer.

558
00:30:44,995 --> 00:30:45,285
Speaker 5:  Like,

559
00:30:45,285 --> 00:30:46,245
Speaker 7:  Oh i's like, all right.

560
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:47,525
Speaker 8:  Excuse me. That's,

561
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:51,045
Speaker 5:  I look, I like the idea that Apple's gonna subsume this entire market. WWC

562
00:30:51,045 --> 00:30:53,805
Speaker 5:  is coming up. We, I've heard now

563
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:58,645
Speaker 5:  drumbeat of ai, ai ai. I've heard someone actually

564
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:01,885
Speaker 5:  say to me, Tim Cook is putting a lot of pressure on himself to deliver AI

565
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:05,285
Speaker 5:  at this wwc. It's a real sentence I heard from someone who knows,

566
00:31:08,025 --> 00:31:09,245
Speaker 5:  you gotta make Siri good.

567
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:10,645
Speaker 8:  Yeah, yeah.

568
00:31:10,645 --> 00:31:12,445
Speaker 5:  Like, let's not kid ourselves. And

569
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:15,485
Speaker 7:  I think that's gonna be hard because the problem is

570
00:31:16,305 --> 00:31:20,205
Speaker 7:  yes, large language models are very good at making these assistants

571
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:23,965
Speaker 7:  loquacious, but they don't make them smart. Yeah. Like, like

572
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,645
Speaker 7:  there's still the core problem of we don't know how to regularly interact

573
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:31,205
Speaker 7:  with a voice assistant in like a comfortable and normal way. Because you're

574
00:31:31,205 --> 00:31:34,445
Speaker 7:  still gonna be like, Hey, can you say it? And you do the, you know, you do

575
00:31:34,445 --> 00:31:37,005
Speaker 7:  the voice. Your Siri voice. What's your Siri voice? Neely.

576
00:31:37,065 --> 00:31:40,205
Speaker 5:  Oh, I don't, I don't You don't have one. I've, I've remapped the action button

577
00:31:40,205 --> 00:31:44,085
Speaker 5:  on my phone at chat GBT. Oh. Which is equally frustrating.

578
00:31:44,105 --> 00:31:44,485
Speaker 5:  But do you,

579
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,605
Speaker 7:  Do you have to do like a special voice, like an intonation to get it to respond

580
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:48,205
Speaker 7:  to you properly?

581
00:31:48,985 --> 00:31:52,725
Speaker 5:  No, I, we do it to the Google assistant in our house.

582
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:54,525
Speaker 7:  What's what's your Google assistant voice?

583
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:55,085
Speaker 5:  Loud.

584
00:31:56,795 --> 00:32:00,485
Speaker 5:  Just loud. Just shouting across the Yeah. Just like,

585
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,325
Speaker 5:  I'm not gonna do it. 'cause they're gonna let off everyone's,

586
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:05,365
Speaker 7:  David, what's yours?

587
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:10,045
Speaker 8:  Mine's very sort of monotone. Yeah. And,

588
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:10,725
Speaker 8:  and

589
00:32:11,155 --> 00:32:14,005
Speaker 5:  Careful. Yeah. You're talking to the robot like a robot.

590
00:32:14,105 --> 00:32:18,045
Speaker 8:  I'm always just like, Siri, please remind me tomorrow at

591
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:21,725
Speaker 8:  9:00 AM to take out the trash before the trash

592
00:32:21,725 --> 00:32:25,165
Speaker 8:  arrives. And then it says, and then it always is like, got it

593
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:28,685
Speaker 8:  added reminder. And I say thanks and it goes, I can't help you with that.

594
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:30,965
Speaker 5:  Cool. That's

595
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:33,965
Speaker 8:  Pretty good. I just wanna put a point on the Siri thing because I've spent

596
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,885
Speaker 8:  a lot of time getting like emails and posts from people being like, Apple's

597
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:40,965
Speaker 8:  gonna do this. Do you, you all know how long Apple has spent trying to make

598
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:44,925
Speaker 8:  Siri good. And do you know how bad Siri is? It's real bad. And and not

599
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:48,805
Speaker 8:  only would Apple have to take the state of the art in AI and put it inside

600
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:52,445
Speaker 8:  of Siri, it would have to make the state of the art in AI much, much, much,

601
00:32:52,475 --> 00:32:56,365
Speaker 8:  much better in order to do the things that we are asking for. Like

602
00:32:56,365 --> 00:33:00,285
Speaker 8:  there, there is no ex extent proof in the universe

603
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:03,845
Speaker 8:  right now that it is possible to build the kind of high quality

604
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,805
Speaker 8:  assistant we're looking for. Like I Siri will get better

605
00:33:07,915 --> 00:33:11,645
Speaker 8:  when they plug in a large language model that just seems to be true. It will,

606
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:14,885
Speaker 8:  it won't be good just because Apple does that. Yeah.

607
00:33:14,955 --> 00:33:18,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The thing that I've been knocking around in my head

608
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:22,525
Speaker 5:  as I read these reviews of these devices, as I think about what's coming

609
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:26,005
Speaker 5:  at this next set of developer conferences, Google IO is happening around

610
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,885
Speaker 5:  the corner, confident we're gonna see a bunch of AI stuff from Google at

611
00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:32,285
Speaker 5:  Google io, right? Yeah. Microsoft Build is coming out. It's all, we're gonna

612
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:35,965
Speaker 5:  see another round of AI stuff. There's a rumor out in the world that we're

613
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:39,765
Speaker 5:  gonna see GPT five soon, who knows? We're gonna see another

614
00:33:39,765 --> 00:33:42,925
Speaker 5:  version of this. What all of them have to show us

615
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:47,005
Speaker 5:  is whether these things are getting intelligent.

616
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:52,245
Speaker 5:  'cause right now all they've shown us is they can fire out a bunch of language.

617
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:52,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

618
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:55,445
Speaker 7:  Loquacious not intelligent.

619
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:59,285
Speaker 5:  Right? And like I know people who talk a lot. It's like,

620
00:33:59,755 --> 00:34:02,485
Speaker 7:  It's like I'm really good at being loquacious and not intelligent. Like

621
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:06,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I, I think that turn remain it just, we'll see. Well, it's just

622
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,085
Speaker 5:  not there yet.

623
00:34:07,215 --> 00:34:07,565
Speaker 8:  Right.

624
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:12,165
Speaker 5:  And I, you know, you can, Sam Altman today was like, I'll spend as much money

625
00:34:12,185 --> 00:34:16,005
Speaker 5:  as it takes to build a GI and it'll be worth it. It's like, dude, you,

626
00:34:16,235 --> 00:34:19,485
Speaker 5:  it's like I can get on a horse and be like, fly and like throw money at the

627
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:23,365
Speaker 5:  horse. Like there's no proof that this thing can do that

628
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:26,245
Speaker 5:  thing. Right? Like, you haven't gotten there yet and you haven't even like

629
00:34:27,205 --> 00:34:28,485
Speaker 5:  demonstrated that you're on the right,

630
00:34:29,305 --> 00:34:32,525
Speaker 7:  I'm sorry. Pathway still seeing you riding a horse, throwing money on your

631
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:33,085
Speaker 7:  head. Why?

632
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,885
Speaker 5:  Why? God damn you.

633
00:34:39,565 --> 00:34:43,485
Speaker 5:  I hate horses. I, in fact, I had a girlfriend in high school with

634
00:34:43,485 --> 00:34:45,885
Speaker 5:  a horse and I realized I was very allergic to the horse. Oh.

635
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:48,525
Speaker 8:  Didn't you ride into your wedding on a horse?

636
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:49,245
Speaker 5:  I did.

637
00:34:49,985 --> 00:34:52,885
Speaker 8:  Did you, did you just sort of make it ran money off of the horse while you

638
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:53,405
Speaker 8:  rode into the

639
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:55,085
Speaker 5:  Wedding? I was, I was just screaming flying. God,

640
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:01,485
Speaker 5:  that's funny. If you're a horse person, you're listening to Bird Cha, first

641
00:35:01,485 --> 00:35:05,445
Speaker 5:  of all, how, what Venn Diagram led you to us. Please let us know. You

642
00:35:05,445 --> 00:35:07,645
Speaker 5:  can email us at Alex Cranz at the berg com,

643
00:35:08,345 --> 00:35:09,165
Speaker 8:  But also we love you,

644
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:13,245
Speaker 5:  But also you're great. I'm so, I'm sorry that personally it's the

645
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:15,445
Speaker 5:  horse thing for me is a real problem. Anyway, we gotta take a break.

646
00:35:17,785 --> 00:35:20,125
Speaker 5:  That's a good, as good a place to end it as any.

647
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:26,685
Speaker 5:  We'll be right back with the money ground. We'll be right

648
00:35:26,685 --> 00:35:26,845
Speaker 5:  back.

649
00:38:33,505 --> 00:38:35,645
Speaker 5:  We're back with the money Round

650
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:40,965
Speaker 5:  Fly. It was when I was in college, there was a parking garage by my house

651
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:44,685
Speaker 5:  and it had a big sign that said Cash Lane

652
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:49,605
Speaker 5:  and my friends and I, we were like, we gotta make that cool. Somehow we're

653
00:38:49,605 --> 00:38:52,725
Speaker 5:  in the cash lane like and we If. you can figure it out. Let me know. I don't

654
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:55,965
Speaker 5:  know if that parking garage is still there but all might have been torn down.

655
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:56,805
Speaker 5:  It was 20 years

656
00:38:56,805 --> 00:39:00,125
Speaker 8:  Ago. Also If, you would like to generate an AI image of Neli in the cash

657
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:03,765
Speaker 8:  lane and send it my way. I would very much appreciate that. Please do

658
00:39:03,765 --> 00:39:07,285
Speaker 5:  It if and If, you run a bank and you'd like to sponsor this, the cash lane

659
00:39:07,285 --> 00:39:07,525
Speaker 5:  round.

660
00:39:09,705 --> 00:39:13,525
Speaker 5:  That's cool. I feel like the banks aren't really promoting the

661
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:14,525
Speaker 5:  idea of cash anymore.

662
00:39:15,235 --> 00:39:16,125
Speaker 7:  They're not fans.

663
00:39:16,995 --> 00:39:20,125
Speaker 5:  They don't use Cash If, you run Cash App

664
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:25,005
Speaker 5:  and you or Jack Dorsey, you should just come on the show. We have a number

665
00:39:25,005 --> 00:39:25,925
Speaker 5:  of questions for you sir.

666
00:39:28,945 --> 00:39:32,685
Speaker 5:  All right. Money round. There's kind of a lot of money floating around.

667
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:36,765
Speaker 5:  Let's, let's stay in the AI for one second. A bunch of sort of like

668
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:40,685
Speaker 5:  search AI money move in the one Google's

669
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:44,285
Speaker 5:  antitrust trial, which we have not talked a lot about because it has been

670
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:48,205
Speaker 5:  very shrouded in secrecy. We have talked about that Google has done a good

671
00:39:48,205 --> 00:39:52,045
Speaker 5:  job sort of shrouding its trial in secrecy. It is now barreling towards

672
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:54,765
Speaker 5:  closing arguments in the search antitrust trial like

673
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:55,405
Speaker 7:  Today, right?

674
00:39:55,595 --> 00:39:59,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So we're covering that and a bunch of documents have been released

675
00:39:59,645 --> 00:40:03,325
Speaker 5:  'cause various news organizations have basically been like filing motions

676
00:40:03,325 --> 00:40:06,765
Speaker 5:  with the court being like, this is crazy. You've gotta release the evidence

677
00:40:06,765 --> 00:40:09,765
Speaker 5:  in this case. So the New York Times and others have been filing motions to

678
00:40:09,765 --> 00:40:12,885
Speaker 5:  get evidence unsealed in this case a bunch of other motions gone through

679
00:40:13,005 --> 00:40:16,525
Speaker 5:  a bunch of documents sort of flooding out here at the end before closing

680
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:20,085
Speaker 5:  arguments. The thing that I think is most important,

681
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:23,925
Speaker 5:  we talk about some other stuff, is that we now have the number for how much

682
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:27,885
Speaker 5:  Google has paid Apple to be the default search placement on

683
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:31,725
Speaker 5:  the iPhone. It is $20 billion in 2022.

684
00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:34,285
Speaker 7:  I'll be the default search on the iPhone,

685
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:38,925
Speaker 5:  Which is crazy. So much money that is a crazy amount of money.

686
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:42,885
Speaker 7:  Like so much money. Yeah, like more money than either of the two

687
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:46,325
Speaker 7:  companies we just talked about in the first round. Like have

688
00:40:47,335 --> 00:40:48,205
Speaker 5:  Dream or will ever

689
00:40:48,205 --> 00:40:48,405
Speaker 7:  Make

690
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:53,005
Speaker 5:  Probably. So the, you know, the argument here is if

691
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:56,845
Speaker 5:  you're running a search engine If, you have AI ideas, you

692
00:40:56,845 --> 00:41:00,645
Speaker 5:  just need a lot of data and Google has gets a lot of data from

693
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:04,685
Speaker 5:  iPhone searchers or are clicking on things or picking results that helps

694
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:08,205
Speaker 5:  'em pick better results, obviously helps 'em serve a lot of ads. It's worth

695
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:12,005
Speaker 5:  a lot of money. Do we think that Google is making money

696
00:41:12,145 --> 00:41:14,245
Speaker 5:  on the $20 billion it pays Apple?

697
00:41:14,985 --> 00:41:18,045
Speaker 8:  Yes. It's a rev share. This, this is the thing that a lot of people miss

698
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:21,085
Speaker 8:  about all of this. This, this is not just like a flat fee that Google

699
00:41:22,235 --> 00:41:26,125
Speaker 8:  pays to Apple. I don't know the exact details of it, but from a

700
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:30,005
Speaker 8:  lot of what we got in the trial, Google is sharing

701
00:41:30,005 --> 00:41:32,765
Speaker 8:  revenue with iPhone,

702
00:41:33,685 --> 00:41:37,395
Speaker 8:  using people with Apple. So if, if I'm

703
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:41,075
Speaker 8:  searching on my iPhone, apple is getting a percentage of that revenue from

704
00:41:41,095 --> 00:41:44,915
Speaker 8:  me every time I use Google. Google wouldn't do this if it

705
00:41:44,915 --> 00:41:48,435
Speaker 8:  wasn't profitable at this point. Sure. Google Google's market share is so

706
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:52,875
Speaker 8:  large and so substantial and a big part of the case that Google

707
00:41:53,015 --> 00:41:56,875
Speaker 8:  is making is Apple saying we picked it because it is the best search

708
00:41:56,875 --> 00:42:00,155
Speaker 8:  engine and not because there is some financial agreement

709
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:05,595
Speaker 8:  separately. Also there is a very lucrative financial agreement. But

710
00:42:06,465 --> 00:42:10,395
Speaker 8:  this is a giant victory for both Apple and Google. And I

711
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:14,355
Speaker 8:  think the, the, the idea that's out there that Apple kind of has Google over

712
00:42:14,475 --> 00:42:15,755
Speaker 8:  a barrel is just not true.

713
00:42:16,255 --> 00:42:20,155
Speaker 5:  So two things there. One, if it's a rev

714
00:42:20,155 --> 00:42:23,755
Speaker 5:  share, that means Apple's making a bunch of money on

715
00:42:23,755 --> 00:42:24,955
Speaker 5:  Google's ad tracking,

716
00:42:26,925 --> 00:42:29,555
Speaker 5:  which seems challenging for Apple to defend.

717
00:42:30,055 --> 00:42:32,995
Speaker 8:  Oh yeah. At the same time that Apple is running around talking about how

718
00:42:33,315 --> 00:42:36,995
Speaker 8:  insecure Android is for precisely that same reason.

719
00:42:37,145 --> 00:42:37,435
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

720
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:41,235
Speaker 5:  So Apple's just collecting a bunch of money on the revenue Google makes through

721
00:42:41,235 --> 00:42:45,075
Speaker 5:  Google search, which is entirely advertising based. Weird, just weird.

722
00:42:45,205 --> 00:42:48,075
Speaker 5:  Fully, fully weird to consider. Second,

723
00:42:49,055 --> 00:42:52,875
Speaker 5:  it is beneficial for Google to keep any

724
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:55,835
Speaker 5:  competitors away. I mean that's the heart of this trial, right? Yeah. Is

725
00:42:55,855 --> 00:42:57,275
Speaker 5:  if Apple picked Bing,

726
00:42:58,955 --> 00:43:02,875
Speaker 5:  whatever, there would instantly be another search engine at scale.

727
00:43:03,865 --> 00:43:07,275
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And Google cannot afford that. So Yeah, sure. It's, it's making a deal

728
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:10,595
Speaker 5:  that works for everybody and it's probably making some money, but I suspect

729
00:43:10,595 --> 00:43:14,315
Speaker 5:  even if it was losing some money, it would be worth it to keep another

730
00:43:14,315 --> 00:43:15,355
Speaker 5:  search engine from emerging.

731
00:43:15,735 --> 00:43:19,595
Speaker 8:  Oh yeah. Satya Nadella remembered last, whatever that was last fall. It feels

732
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:22,435
Speaker 8:  like ancient history now got on the stand and said he would've done it for

733
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:26,315
Speaker 8:  free just to get the queries coming from iPhone

734
00:43:26,315 --> 00:43:30,235
Speaker 8:  users. Because better queries would've meant better results. Would've meant

735
00:43:30,255 --> 00:43:33,475
Speaker 8:  better Ad placements would've meant more expensive ads. Would've meant more

736
00:43:33,635 --> 00:43:36,075
Speaker 8:  queries. And like on and on and on and on it goes and

737
00:43:37,025 --> 00:43:40,795
Speaker 8:  basically offered this whole thing, you can,

738
00:43:40,815 --> 00:43:44,475
Speaker 8:  you can keep all the money Apple, we just want the searches.

739
00:43:45,015 --> 00:43:48,875
Speaker 8:  And Apple said no. And that was a total non-starter for them. And

740
00:43:49,135 --> 00:43:52,235
Speaker 8:  you're totally right. Like obviously it's a huge victory for Google to get

741
00:43:52,235 --> 00:43:55,715
Speaker 8:  this and it's why, at least according to testimony, we've heard

742
00:43:55,785 --> 00:43:58,475
Speaker 8:  Apple's share of that revenue has gone up over time.

743
00:43:59,575 --> 00:44:03,475
Speaker 8:  But still, like Google, Google is not in the habit of

744
00:44:03,495 --> 00:44:07,395
Speaker 8:  losing $20 billion to maintain its

745
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:10,355
Speaker 8:  place as the dominant search engine that everybody uses.

746
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:14,795
Speaker 8:  That's just, it just hasn't had to make that choice yet. And I don't think

747
00:44:14,795 --> 00:44:15,555
Speaker 8:  this is that choice.

748
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:18,635
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Google just likes losing money in other weird ways. Right?

749
00:44:18,635 --> 00:44:22,595
Speaker 8:  Google likes to throw money at, at like roller skating executives trying

750
00:44:22,595 --> 00:44:25,155
Speaker 8:  to build self-driving cars. Yeah. Not search ads.

751
00:44:26,675 --> 00:44:30,435
Speaker 7:  I I was really surprised though by the part where they said that Apple's

752
00:44:30,745 --> 00:44:33,845
Speaker 7:  like, or the 2020 payments that Google paid was

753
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:38,005
Speaker 7:  17.5% of Apple's operating income. That seems like

754
00:44:38,705 --> 00:44:42,245
Speaker 7:  an awful lot. It's nuts. Am I like misunderstanding the numbers there?

755
00:44:42,585 --> 00:44:43,845
Speaker 7:  Do I not understand business?

756
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:48,365
Speaker 8:  I mean that essentially means a a a and a fifth of

757
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:52,045
Speaker 8:  Apple's profit is coming from this deal because Apple

758
00:44:52,145 --> 00:44:54,925
Speaker 8:  is pure profit. And Apple would tell you it's not that all the money that

759
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:58,285
Speaker 8:  they put into making the iPhone terrific is what makes that comfort. But

760
00:44:58,285 --> 00:45:02,205
Speaker 8:  that's like a bunch of me mouth nonsense. It's it is pure profit to Apple

761
00:45:02,225 --> 00:45:05,125
Speaker 8:  and it accounts for a huge amount of the money that that company makes.

762
00:45:05,595 --> 00:45:07,725
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And that's just wild to me.

763
00:45:08,035 --> 00:45:08,885
Speaker 8:  It's so much money

764
00:45:09,355 --> 00:45:12,885
Speaker 7:  Like that Apple is that dependent on Google?

765
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:16,405
Speaker 5:  I don't know if it's dependency.

766
00:45:16,515 --> 00:45:20,285
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I I think that's where like, I'm like, do I understand business correctly?

767
00:45:20,565 --> 00:45:21,245
Speaker 7:  'cause well

768
00:45:21,425 --> 00:45:25,365
Speaker 5:  It is it in that if it went away, it would be a dependency

769
00:45:25,385 --> 00:45:29,245
Speaker 5:  and maybe this trial will lead to some outcome in which it changes and the

770
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:33,125
Speaker 5:  money changes in different ways. But I think what

771
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:36,885
Speaker 5:  it actually speaks to is the, the phone market slowing down.

772
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:40,645
Speaker 5:  Apple itself is looking for whatever next thing will exist, right?

773
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:44,445
Speaker 5:  They just spent $10 billion on the car and shut it down.

774
00:45:45,235 --> 00:45:48,205
Speaker 5:  They spent half of that Google money trying to build a car

775
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:49,965
Speaker 7:  One year of Google money.

776
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:53,125
Speaker 5:  Like literally the equivalent of Apple getting on a horse and screaming fly.

777
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:58,365
Speaker 5:  It just didn't work. Didn't work. You can't get in a midsize crossover and

778
00:45:58,365 --> 00:46:01,725
Speaker 5:  be like, don't have a steering wheel. Like you can't do it. What Apple is

779
00:46:01,965 --> 00:46:05,645
Speaker 5:  addicted to is monetizing every interaction you have on the phone. Yeah.

780
00:46:05,895 --> 00:46:09,125
Speaker 5:  Right. And this is, I has just led the company into

781
00:46:09,635 --> 00:46:13,485
Speaker 5:  more and more perilous waters because that means a

782
00:46:13,485 --> 00:46:16,205
Speaker 5:  bunch of people are now mad at Apple all the time, including a bunch of European

783
00:46:16,205 --> 00:46:19,845
Speaker 5:  regulators, including our Department of Justice, what, whatever it is. But

784
00:46:20,705 --> 00:46:24,605
Speaker 5:  the fact that Apple makes as much money as it does when

785
00:46:24,605 --> 00:46:27,685
Speaker 5:  people merely search for things in the web browser,

786
00:46:28,395 --> 00:46:28,685
Speaker 5:  it's

787
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:32,445
Speaker 7:  Insane. It's brutal. Yeah. Yeah. I think that was the like really

788
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:35,325
Speaker 7:  surprising part. You're just, anytime you type in, you're, you're helping

789
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,085
Speaker 7:  Apple make a shit ton of money. Right.

790
00:46:38,085 --> 00:46:42,005
Speaker 5:  And I, you know, maybe that's fine and Apple's free to run its business

791
00:46:42,005 --> 00:46:45,365
Speaker 5:  how it wants. Yep. But you can see that the, the chain

792
00:46:45,765 --> 00:46:49,725
Speaker 5:  reaction of Apple saying it's our phone and every single thing you do

793
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:53,485
Speaker 5:  on our phone should generate revenue for us as the backstop

794
00:46:53,545 --> 00:46:57,365
Speaker 5:  to the upgrade cycles are slowing. The phone market overall

795
00:46:57,365 --> 00:47:00,965
Speaker 5:  is contracting, da da da, all that stuff. They hedged it by saying, okay,

796
00:47:00,965 --> 00:47:03,645
Speaker 5:  we're gonna, we're gonna, everything on your phone is not being monetized.

797
00:47:04,015 --> 00:47:06,725
Speaker 5:  We're gonna be aggressive with app developers. We're gonna have this deal

798
00:47:06,725 --> 00:47:10,525
Speaker 5:  with Google everything. We're gonna shut down

799
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:13,205
Speaker 5:  ads with app tracking transparency, which is maybe a good thing. But then

800
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:17,045
Speaker 5:  we're gonna move the entire market of app install ads to the

801
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:20,405
Speaker 5:  app store and the app store gets, it's getting really weird. All of those

802
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:24,125
Speaker 5:  things are just them monetizing the software on the phone or the experiences

803
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:27,805
Speaker 5:  you have on the phone. Yeah. I think this trial is like shown us this is

804
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:31,725
Speaker 5:  real, you know, like it's, this is a real pressure Apple feels and

805
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:34,645
Speaker 5:  they're collecting a bunch of money from Google for the thing most people

806
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:38,085
Speaker 5:  do on the phone most of the time. Which is just like search for things in

807
00:47:38,085 --> 00:47:41,845
Speaker 5:  the web browser. And then on the flip side, more

808
00:47:42,085 --> 00:47:46,045
Speaker 5:  documents in the trial reveal. Microsoft is like terrified of this. And

809
00:47:46,435 --> 00:47:50,125
Speaker 5:  they're looking at Google's investments in AI and what they can accomplish

810
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:53,885
Speaker 5:  there. They freak out and that's why they go invest in open

811
00:47:54,025 --> 00:47:58,005
Speaker 5:  ai. Yep. Which you just see like Google's at the center of

812
00:47:58,045 --> 00:48:00,485
Speaker 5:  a lot of things happening in tech right now. 'cause they're just throwing

813
00:48:00,485 --> 00:48:04,085
Speaker 5:  money around. Google did have a good quarter this last quarter

814
00:48:04,485 --> 00:48:07,725
Speaker 5:  like they did. Well it turns out people are still using Google search, but

815
00:48:07,725 --> 00:48:11,605
Speaker 5:  you can see the threat it's under and you can see Google turning the

816
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:15,445
Speaker 5:  revenue lever on Google search to have

817
00:48:15,445 --> 00:48:19,245
Speaker 5:  it make money instead of be good. Yep. More documents from the trial.

818
00:48:19,245 --> 00:48:23,085
Speaker 5:  We should, ed Tron wrote Thiss, the title was the Man Who Killed

819
00:48:23,085 --> 00:48:26,765
Speaker 5:  Google Search. And basically the thesis that story, which we'll link to is

820
00:48:27,545 --> 00:48:30,725
Speaker 5:  the revenue teams at Google came to search and said we need to make more

821
00:48:30,725 --> 00:48:34,605
Speaker 5:  revenue on search. The search team was like, no search is pure. And the

822
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:35,245
Speaker 5:  search team lost.

823
00:48:35,555 --> 00:48:37,885
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And we've all felt it

824
00:48:38,305 --> 00:48:39,045
Speaker 5:  And we've all felt it

825
00:48:39,595 --> 00:48:40,645
Speaker 7:  Like very keenly.

826
00:48:40,915 --> 00:48:44,405
Speaker 8:  Well I think one of the things that has come up a bunch in this trial that

827
00:48:44,565 --> 00:48:48,005
Speaker 8:  Ed also pointed out in his piece is that the question of

828
00:48:48,355 --> 00:48:52,325
Speaker 8:  what does good search look like is

829
00:48:52,425 --> 00:48:55,925
Speaker 8:  so mealy and hard to put your finger on that

830
00:48:55,925 --> 00:48:58,685
Speaker 8:  literally what you are like goaling your team against

831
00:48:59,755 --> 00:49:02,765
Speaker 8:  changes the way that you do business. Right? So If you, if you're Google

832
00:49:02,785 --> 00:49:06,285
Speaker 8:  and you say, okay, the thing that we are going to measure is

833
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:10,445
Speaker 8:  number of search queries, the main thing we are going to do is make search

834
00:49:10,645 --> 00:49:13,565
Speaker 8:  queries go up. Like s Phai always talks about this when he was running Chrome,

835
00:49:13,565 --> 00:49:17,485
Speaker 8:  right? That the, the goal was the fastest web browser and they, they built

836
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:19,525
Speaker 8:  a bunch of things around that. But that was the goal. And so If, you run

837
00:49:19,525 --> 00:49:22,405
Speaker 8:  towards the fastest web browser, you build a certain kind of web browser,

838
00:49:22,705 --> 00:49:25,925
Speaker 8:  If, you run towards do the most searches. You're actually not

839
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:29,885
Speaker 8:  incentivized to make the search engine great because it means people

840
00:49:29,885 --> 00:49:33,125
Speaker 8:  will actually search less because they found what they needed faster. But

841
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:36,285
Speaker 8:  in a certain way you also say, okay, if we get people to do more searches,

842
00:49:36,305 --> 00:49:39,805
Speaker 8:  it must mean people like Google because they're doing more searches. And

843
00:49:40,475 --> 00:49:44,045
Speaker 8:  both of those things are true. And yet they're completely mutually exclusive.

844
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:47,965
Speaker 8:  And, and I think this is what in, in a lot of ways seems to have happened

845
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:50,565
Speaker 8:  to Google as they got to the point where they were like, okay, we make money

846
00:49:50,565 --> 00:49:53,605
Speaker 8:  when people do searches, we need people to do more searches. And so they

847
00:49:53,605 --> 00:49:57,525
Speaker 8:  started spending money on deals like with Apple

848
00:49:57,545 --> 00:50:01,405
Speaker 8:  and Mozilla and others they started changing the way that the

849
00:50:01,405 --> 00:50:04,965
Speaker 8:  pages work and the results were delivered in order to get people to do more

850
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:09,005
Speaker 8:  searches. And that just sends you down a really ugly road.

851
00:50:09,025 --> 00:50:12,765
Speaker 8:  You make people do more searches, but it actually, you don't care about

852
00:50:12,865 --> 00:50:16,605
Speaker 8:  the experience as long as people are doing more searches. And that's just

853
00:50:16,605 --> 00:50:19,085
Speaker 8:  that, that's what the thing that I think feels bad to people.

854
00:50:19,555 --> 00:50:23,085
Speaker 7:  It's the what? What's Corey Dr. O call it in Ification? Yeah. I hate that

855
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:24,165
Speaker 7:  word, but it's a really good word. It's a

856
00:50:24,165 --> 00:50:26,805
Speaker 8:  Good word. I wish he'd come up with a better term. Yeah. It's a, it's a very

857
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:30,205
Speaker 8:  useful like construct, but it's an awful word.

858
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:31,485
Speaker 5:  I love it.

859
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:35,405
Speaker 8:  Have you ever tried to type it? I can't. I have never once typed it successfully

860
00:50:35,425 --> 00:50:35,885
Speaker 8:  on the first

861
00:50:35,945 --> 00:50:39,525
Speaker 5:  Try. No. But by the time I get to around to being like, I should type this,

862
00:50:39,525 --> 00:50:42,925
Speaker 5:  like 15 people have said it or typed it before I do. That's true. That's

863
00:50:43,045 --> 00:50:45,845
Speaker 5:  'cause it's the default response to anything getting worse. Whether it counts

864
00:50:45,845 --> 00:50:49,565
Speaker 5:  or not. 'cause specifically what Corey means is that most

865
00:50:49,905 --> 00:50:53,765
Speaker 5:  web platforms products start by delivering a surplus of value

866
00:50:53,765 --> 00:50:57,445
Speaker 5:  to you. 'cause they're all losing money at the beginning. Then they take

867
00:50:57,445 --> 00:51:01,245
Speaker 5:  away that value from their advertisers. Right? They squeeze advertisers for

868
00:51:01,245 --> 00:51:05,165
Speaker 5:  dollars, then that levers full, fully pulled and then they'd look at

869
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:08,325
Speaker 5:  you and they turn the knob away from you. Right. And like that's just the

870
00:51:08,325 --> 00:51:11,765
Speaker 5:  cycle of the subsidized web platform.

871
00:51:11,765 --> 00:51:13,645
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And that's what's Google's stuff. Yeah.

872
00:51:14,145 --> 00:51:17,245
Speaker 5:  And you can, you can just see it with Google search. Like first they squeeze

873
00:51:17,245 --> 00:51:21,165
Speaker 5:  the advertisers and then that is not great. So

874
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:25,085
Speaker 5:  now they're like, now it's you. You know the Google product

875
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:28,925
Speaker 5:  recommendations, the house fresh people. Yeah. They're,

876
00:51:28,925 --> 00:51:31,925
Speaker 5:  they're starting to get more expensive. So you search for a product on Google

877
00:51:32,225 --> 00:51:35,085
Speaker 5:  and they're starting to recommend you slightly more expensive products.

878
00:51:35,435 --> 00:51:39,165
Speaker 7:  That part like shocked me. Yeah. Because they did a really good bar graph

879
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:41,805
Speaker 7:  there. Yeah. It was just really impressed with the bar graph and everything

880
00:51:41,805 --> 00:51:45,125
Speaker 7:  was like red and and orange and showing it was really expensive. And then

881
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:48,605
Speaker 7:  the house fresh, which is at the very bottom, bright green, smallest bar.

882
00:51:48,715 --> 00:51:51,165
Speaker 7:  Yeah. We're always the cheapest. And I was respect it.

883
00:51:52,345 --> 00:51:55,725
Speaker 5:  It turns out a fan blowing air through a filter is not necessarily an expensive

884
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:55,885
Speaker 5:  product.

885
00:51:57,755 --> 00:52:01,565
Speaker 5:  Well to all of this stuff. But the point of this is like Google's

886
00:52:01,715 --> 00:52:05,645
Speaker 5:  dominance of the ecosystem actually extends in every direction. Right?

887
00:52:05,675 --> 00:52:09,645
Speaker 5:  It's pushing Microsoft to invest in open ai. One

888
00:52:09,645 --> 00:52:13,285
Speaker 5:  of the documents here is Satya Nadela forwarding an email

889
00:52:13,355 --> 00:52:17,205
Speaker 5:  from Kevin Scott, the head of AI explaining that Google's getting better

890
00:52:17,205 --> 00:52:21,165
Speaker 5:  at stuff to the CFO of Microsoft. I mean like this is why I want to

891
00:52:21,165 --> 00:52:24,885
Speaker 5:  invest in open ai. Like this is the reason. Here's, here's my, here's

892
00:52:24,945 --> 00:52:28,205
Speaker 5:  my as the CEO justification to you as the CFO

893
00:52:28,825 --> 00:52:31,885
Speaker 5:  of spending $13 billion over the next few years

894
00:52:32,705 --> 00:52:36,525
Speaker 5:  to compete with Google. 'cause we see the opening and we're behind. And on

895
00:52:36,525 --> 00:52:40,445
Speaker 5:  the other side, you see Apple just again,

896
00:52:40,645 --> 00:52:44,365
Speaker 5:  a huge percentage of their incoming revenue. Right. Which is pure

897
00:52:44,365 --> 00:52:46,325
Speaker 5:  profit basically. 'cause they're not doing anything

898
00:52:48,835 --> 00:52:52,325
Speaker 5:  like that's a danger zone for them if this trial ends in some different thing

899
00:52:52,325 --> 00:52:56,205
Speaker 5:  happening, like Apple starts to go off course. Yeah. Which

900
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:57,485
Speaker 5:  is crazy to think about. Well

901
00:52:57,485 --> 00:52:59,765
Speaker 7:  I think the thing that strikes me there is like

902
00:53:01,135 --> 00:53:04,085
Speaker 7:  we've always talked, everybody talks a lot about how clever Apple is and

903
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:07,805
Speaker 7:  how good it is at making money and, and how good its products are and how

904
00:53:07,805 --> 00:53:09,605
Speaker 7:  its products have really driven it to this place where it's really good at

905
00:53:09,605 --> 00:53:11,885
Speaker 7:  making money. Does this kind of

906
00:53:13,355 --> 00:53:17,005
Speaker 7:  like prove that wrong? The fact that they were making so much money off

907
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:18,085
Speaker 7:  essentially doing nothing.

908
00:53:19,725 --> 00:53:22,165
Speaker 5:  I, it's like hard to begrudge Apple for being

909
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:25,485
Speaker 7:  Like, yeah, free money's free money. Like, you know, free money's nice. But

910
00:53:25,485 --> 00:53:29,085
Speaker 5:  Like it just feels to me like no one eats for free in Tim Cook's house.

911
00:53:29,785 --> 00:53:32,565
Speaker 8:  It does seem a little bit like the vibe of

912
00:53:33,455 --> 00:53:37,405
Speaker 8:  Apple has shifted from like a bunch of geniuses around those

913
00:53:37,425 --> 00:53:41,285
Speaker 8:  blonde wood tables. Desi designing stuff to like a handful of

914
00:53:41,925 --> 00:53:45,845
Speaker 8:  unbelievably good negotiators. Yeah. Yeah. Winning deals. And like

915
00:53:45,845 --> 00:53:49,645
Speaker 8:  that is the sort of mental picture that I have of Apple now is just

916
00:53:49,645 --> 00:53:53,605
Speaker 8:  like Eddie Q and Craig Federighi just like rolling into

917
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,405
Speaker 8:  rooms being like, what's up losers?

918
00:53:56,965 --> 00:53:57,325
Speaker 8:  I win

919
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,245
Speaker 7:  On a segue. Yeah.

920
00:53:59,505 --> 00:54:03,365
Speaker 5:  Out. I would point out that this is the other antitrust trial. Yes. Right.

921
00:54:03,555 --> 00:54:07,365
Speaker 5:  That specific thing. How much power does Apple have? That's the DOJ

922
00:54:07,365 --> 00:54:08,085
Speaker 5:  case against Apple.

923
00:54:09,775 --> 00:54:13,085
Speaker 5:  We'll see, I don't know how that one's gonna go, but that thing, the vibe

924
00:54:13,145 --> 00:54:17,125
Speaker 5:  you are describing, Eddie Q shows up to Hollywood, passes out in your boardroom

925
00:54:17,305 --> 00:54:21,005
Speaker 5:  and you still have to give him a deal. Like there's reporting that

926
00:54:21,285 --> 00:54:23,485
Speaker 5:  happened. I'm not just making that up. I dunno if that's true or not. There's

927
00:54:23,485 --> 00:54:26,405
Speaker 5:  reporting that that's happened before and you still have to make the deal.

928
00:54:26,405 --> 00:54:29,245
Speaker 5:  That's just Apple's power being expressed. Okay. So that's Apple. That's

929
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:31,525
Speaker 5:  the money stuff. That's money stuff. Apple, Google, Microsoft Money stuff.

930
00:54:31,585 --> 00:54:33,045
Speaker 5:  Yes. Other money stuff.

931
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:33,925
Speaker 7:  Less fun,

932
00:54:33,995 --> 00:54:37,965
Speaker 5:  Less exciting. Peloton, which V just wrote a big

933
00:54:37,965 --> 00:54:41,885
Speaker 5:  profile of, which was very prescient. Now she's like, what's up

934
00:54:41,885 --> 00:54:45,525
Speaker 5:  with Peloton? The answer is nothing good. The CEO is quitting

935
00:54:45,985 --> 00:54:48,325
Speaker 5:  and they're flying off more hundreds more people.

936
00:54:49,895 --> 00:54:53,685
Speaker 5:  Which is weird. So the, the CEO Barry McCarthy joined Peloton, his

937
00:54:53,685 --> 00:54:57,365
Speaker 5:  whole thing was that he was like a Netflix guy. Yeah. And

938
00:54:57,365 --> 00:55:00,565
Speaker 5:  Pelotons a subscription service. So he is gonna do a good job at the subscription

939
00:55:00,565 --> 00:55:00,765
Speaker 5:  service.

940
00:55:02,705 --> 00:55:06,485
Speaker 5:  He did not do that. Nope. He is

941
00:55:06,485 --> 00:55:09,725
Speaker 5:  laying off 15% of the staff, which is about 400 people around the world.

942
00:55:09,905 --> 00:55:11,725
Speaker 5:  That's the fifth round of layoffs.

943
00:55:12,395 --> 00:55:13,165
Speaker 7:  Well, he's leaving

944
00:55:13,705 --> 00:55:17,685
Speaker 5:  And by the way, last quarter he set on the earnings call, we're

945
00:55:17,685 --> 00:55:21,525
Speaker 5:  done with layoffs and the ship is turning. He was

946
00:55:21,535 --> 00:55:21,885
Speaker 5:  wrong.

947
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,925
Speaker 7:  Very wrong. Extremely wrong.

948
00:55:25,385 --> 00:55:26,845
Speaker 5:  And then he's, he's leaving.

949
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:32,005
Speaker 5:  He took over from the founder who was a little more chaotic. He was supposed

950
00:55:32,005 --> 00:55:33,045
Speaker 5:  to be the adult and now

951
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:37,765
Speaker 7:  It's two board members are now in charge, which is like, that's

952
00:55:37,765 --> 00:55:40,445
Speaker 7:  never a good sign when it's like, yeah. Two board members are gonna be in

953
00:55:40,445 --> 00:55:43,725
Speaker 7:  charge until we find a new CEO. Yeah. Ooh,

954
00:55:44,185 --> 00:55:44,765
Speaker 7:  that's rough.

955
00:55:44,765 --> 00:55:46,125
Speaker 5:  Peloton. Yeah. That who just got clipped.

956
00:55:46,275 --> 00:55:47,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yikes.

957
00:55:48,705 --> 00:55:51,445
Speaker 5:  So we'll see what happens in Ton. It's obviously very sticky. People love

958
00:55:51,445 --> 00:55:55,205
Speaker 5:  it that instructors are famous. You should go read v's. Piece and kinda

959
00:55:55,315 --> 00:55:58,165
Speaker 5:  lays out what's happening here. Well re link it. It was from a few weeks

960
00:55:58,165 --> 00:56:02,125
Speaker 5:  ago. Again, she saw this future coming. Yeah. by the

961
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,365
Speaker 5:  way, Barry McCarthy has never responded to request to be on decoder and I

962
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:06,805
Speaker 5:  suspect No, he never will. No,

963
00:56:06,965 --> 00:56:10,645
Speaker 8:  I know why. I will say just two thoughts on that one. I think reading

964
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:14,565
Speaker 8:  the comments of that Peloton story was really interesting because the

965
00:56:14,565 --> 00:56:18,325
Speaker 8:  number of people who drew a direct line from the

966
00:56:18,325 --> 00:56:22,125
Speaker 8:  existence of Apple Fitness plus to the demise of Peloton is really

967
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:25,845
Speaker 8:  fascinating. I have no data on how successful Apple Fitness Plus is, but

968
00:56:26,235 --> 00:56:30,045
Speaker 8:  just purely anecdotally speaking, like in my life and the people I know,

969
00:56:31,075 --> 00:56:35,005
Speaker 8:  it's gone very well and I, and I think Fitness Plus, yeah, it's like it's

970
00:56:35,005 --> 00:56:37,605
Speaker 8:  out there. It's like a thing people know about. It's not that expensive.

971
00:56:37,605 --> 00:56:41,565
Speaker 8:  It's on your device. People who are like buying Apple watches are prone

972
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:44,485
Speaker 8:  to like that kind of thing. Anyway, it gives you the classes. It just seems

973
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:48,365
Speaker 8:  like Peloton maybe thought it had a moat

974
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:49,525
Speaker 8:  that it didn't, I think.

975
00:56:49,955 --> 00:56:50,245
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

976
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:54,445
Speaker 8:  And add that to the, they got very excited because

977
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:57,605
Speaker 8:  everybody bought one during the pandemic and they said, oh, maybe this will

978
00:56:57,605 --> 00:57:01,325
Speaker 8:  be our demand forever. Which was just an insane thing to

979
00:57:01,325 --> 00:57:05,245
Speaker 8:  decide at that particular moment in time. But it, it's just interesting that

980
00:57:05,245 --> 00:57:08,165
Speaker 8:  I think the question about Peloton has always been how do you take a thing

981
00:57:08,355 --> 00:57:12,085
Speaker 8:  that is by all accounts very good and people really like and botch it so

982
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:15,885
Speaker 8:  spectacularly. And I think maybe I have underrated the extent to which

983
00:57:16,145 --> 00:57:20,005
Speaker 8:  it has been kind of eaten alive by some of the other

984
00:57:20,005 --> 00:57:20,845
Speaker 8:  products out there.

985
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:25,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean I think connected fitness is a thing v has

986
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:29,005
Speaker 5:  written about it. Yeah. Like people want these products. Peloton is a gold

987
00:57:29,285 --> 00:57:31,645
Speaker 5:  standard brand though, right? It is. It is. People

988
00:57:31,645 --> 00:57:32,445
Speaker 8:  Love Peloton.

989
00:57:32,605 --> 00:57:35,765
Speaker 7:  I feel like the people who are using Apple Fitness are not necessarily the

990
00:57:35,765 --> 00:57:39,085
Speaker 7:  same people who use Peloton. Like the people who use Apple Fitness are like

991
00:57:39,345 --> 00:57:42,445
Speaker 7:  me, where every three months I'm like, this is the time

992
00:57:43,345 --> 00:57:46,965
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna start working out all the time and become a total gym rat in my

993
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:50,605
Speaker 7:  house. That's who's using Apple Fitness. Right? It's people who are like,

994
00:57:50,605 --> 00:57:54,485
Speaker 7:  this is easy. I can just hop into this. Peloton is like, I'm going to spend

995
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,605
Speaker 7:  thousands of dollars on this equipment. I'm going to have it in my home and

996
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:58,165
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna use it

997
00:57:58,225 --> 00:57:59,165
Speaker 5:  And pay a subscription

998
00:57:59,165 --> 00:58:02,005
Speaker 7:  Fee. Yeah. And pay a subscription fee. And it's, I think those are very kind

999
00:58:02,005 --> 00:58:02,925
Speaker 7:  of different audiences

1000
00:58:02,995 --> 00:58:06,885
Speaker 8:  That could be Peloton is also stupidly expensive and has remained stupidly

1001
00:58:06,885 --> 00:58:08,125
Speaker 8:  expensive for way too long.

1002
00:58:08,435 --> 00:58:10,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's like $45 a month for our subscription. Yeah.

1003
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:12,445
Speaker 8:  It's ridiculous. Like

1004
00:58:12,525 --> 00:58:13,965
Speaker 5:  I could pay for 10 HPO max

1005
00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:15,325
Speaker 8:  And

1006
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,285
Speaker 5:  I will, it's not even true at this point. It's like one and a half HPO

1007
00:58:19,285 --> 00:58:19,445
Speaker 8:  Max

1008
00:58:20,365 --> 00:58:22,565
Speaker 5:  Speaking of boards, that should take a hard look at the CEO

1009
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,805
Speaker 5:  EI

1010
00:58:25,805 --> 00:58:26,725
Speaker 7:  Already know who you're talking about.

1011
00:58:27,115 --> 00:58:30,765
Speaker 5:  Elon has gone quote absolutely hard core with Tesla layoffs.

1012
00:58:31,505 --> 00:58:35,485
Speaker 5:  He fired the entire supercharger team, including the people who are in

1013
00:58:35,485 --> 00:58:39,205
Speaker 5:  charge of refurbishing and installing new superchargers, which

1014
00:58:39,205 --> 00:58:42,725
Speaker 5:  seems very bad because everyone just signed up to use their connector.

1015
00:58:43,475 --> 00:58:44,005
Speaker 7:  Well, you heard the

1016
00:58:44,005 --> 00:58:45,245
Speaker 5:  Rumor, the a CS connector

1017
00:58:45,465 --> 00:58:46,565
Speaker 7:  For you did this. Why

1018
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:47,405
Speaker 5:  Did you do this? So

1019
00:58:47,405 --> 00:58:50,405
Speaker 7:  The rumor is that the, the head of the supercharger unit

1020
00:58:51,315 --> 00:58:55,245
Speaker 7:  said, no, I, I like pushed back on the number of layoffs that she was asked

1021
00:58:55,245 --> 00:58:59,005
Speaker 7:  to do. And he was like, no, you're fired too.

1022
00:58:59,075 --> 00:59:02,445
Speaker 7:  Everybody on your team to prove a point to the rest of the team. That was

1023
00:59:02,445 --> 00:59:03,645
Speaker 7:  some of the reporting we saw this week.

1024
00:59:04,705 --> 00:59:08,645
Speaker 5:  And the point is, no one can do a good as job as

1025
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:08,925
Speaker 5:  someone.

1026
00:59:10,155 --> 00:59:14,045
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I like, I I think it was, it sounds like the, the, the piece

1027
00:59:14,065 --> 00:59:17,845
Speaker 7:  was mainly about how he was really just pushing himself

1028
00:59:18,185 --> 00:59:21,460
Speaker 7:  out there and he's like, he's in charge and just reasserting his authority

1029
00:59:21,535 --> 00:59:24,205
Speaker 7:  after being at Twitter all this time and coming back in and being like, do

1030
00:59:24,205 --> 00:59:27,605
Speaker 7:  what I say and If. you don't wanna do what I say, you're gone and so is your

1031
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:27,765
Speaker 7:  team.

1032
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:32,005
Speaker 8:  Well that's a long running Elon Musk trend of of Right.

1033
00:59:32,005 --> 00:59:35,845
Speaker 8:  Wanting to be the shiny face on everything and demanding

1034
00:59:36,665 --> 00:59:40,125
Speaker 8:  to sort of disappear for a long time and then come back and exert total control

1035
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:43,285
Speaker 8:  and then disappear for a long time. Again. That, that tracks with a lot of

1036
00:59:43,285 --> 00:59:46,565
Speaker 8:  what we've heard about his management style over the years. Yeah. Is there

1037
00:59:46,565 --> 00:59:50,485
Speaker 8:  something I'm missing in the why Tesla would slow down

1038
00:59:50,665 --> 00:59:53,445
Speaker 8:  its investment in Superchargers? Because everything I've understood about

1039
00:59:53,445 --> 00:59:56,925
Speaker 8:  this company, and I do not proclaim to be an expert in Tesla, would suggest

1040
00:59:56,925 --> 01:00:00,845
Speaker 8:  that actually the supercharger network is one of the things it should be

1041
01:00:00,845 --> 01:00:01,925
Speaker 8:  investing in the most.

1042
01:00:02,455 --> 01:00:06,045
Speaker 5:  Right. Especially because now there's expanding demand for it. Right?

1043
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:10,125
Speaker 5:  Right. Like If, you get Rivian and Ford and all

1044
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:13,965
Speaker 5:  these other companies like using it BMW. Like you can't

1045
01:00:13,965 --> 01:00:17,605
Speaker 5:  name a company in North America that's not about to use NACS and sign a supercharge

1046
01:00:17,605 --> 01:00:20,645
Speaker 5:  deal. Right. If they're all coming online, like demand for supercharging

1047
01:00:20,705 --> 01:00:23,805
Speaker 5:  is gonna go up and they're gonna pay you money to

1048
01:00:23,805 --> 01:00:27,565
Speaker 8:  Use it. Does Deon Musk just like not want to be a gas station mogul?

1049
01:00:27,595 --> 01:00:29,445
Speaker 8:  Like, is that, is that just where we're landing?

1050
01:00:29,765 --> 01:00:33,365
Speaker 7:  I think that's why, why this, this theory that he did it to exert

1051
01:00:33,745 --> 01:00:37,525
Speaker 7:  his, his dominance essentially is, is so popular because like

1052
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:41,445
Speaker 7:  it doesn't make sense. But then you'll hear the rumor about how Elon

1053
01:00:41,445 --> 01:00:45,405
Speaker 7:  always wants to be in charge. And it starts to, that theory makes a little

1054
01:00:45,405 --> 01:00:45,605
Speaker 7:  sense.

1055
01:00:45,915 --> 01:00:49,525
Speaker 5:  Andy and I did an entire episode on Tesla on decoder this week. So just go

1056
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:53,005
Speaker 5:  listen to that. We can move off it. But we didn't talk about superchargers

1057
01:00:53,005 --> 01:00:56,765
Speaker 5:  enough on that episode, I think. And this to me is like, you take your

1058
01:00:56,965 --> 01:00:58,685
Speaker 5:  greatest advantage and you're like, stop.

1059
01:00:59,035 --> 01:01:02,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That it's, it's just bonkers. Yeah. It makes no

1060
01:01:02,965 --> 01:01:03,685
Speaker 7:  logical sense.

1061
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,045
Speaker 5:  Like If, you ask people like people Yes. People love the fact that the cars

1062
01:01:07,065 --> 01:01:09,845
Speaker 5:  get over their updates and have fart mode and all this stuff. What is the

1063
01:01:09,845 --> 01:01:13,285
Speaker 5:  real reason people buy a Tesla when they're in the ev market charging network?

1064
01:01:13,515 --> 01:01:17,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And like you just literally no one's working

1065
01:01:17,445 --> 01:01:20,485
Speaker 5:  out. Like if one breaks right now, it's unclear who will come and fix it.

1066
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:22,445
Speaker 5:  Yep. Weird. Just a

1067
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:25,205
Speaker 7:  Weird And they canceled a bunch as well too, right? Yeah. So

1068
01:01:25,485 --> 01:01:29,125
Speaker 8:  I saw a tweet this morning, I think that was like, I wonder how many

1069
01:01:29,925 --> 01:01:33,325
Speaker 8:  charging startups will trace their founding day to whatever it was

1070
01:01:33,325 --> 01:01:36,525
Speaker 8:  April 30th, 2024. And like,

1071
01:01:37,305 --> 01:01:41,055
Speaker 8:  feels, kind of, feels kind of right. Somebody, somebody has to show up and

1072
01:01:41,055 --> 01:01:44,695
Speaker 8:  solve this problem in order to make electric vehicles work. And it is increasingly

1073
01:01:44,695 --> 01:01:45,735
Speaker 8:  unclear who that's gonna be.

1074
01:01:46,575 --> 01:01:50,215
Speaker 5:  I think I so my so that way too, and I was like zero.

1075
01:01:51,245 --> 01:01:55,215
Speaker 5:  Like this is an incredibly enormously expensive business to

1076
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:58,895
Speaker 5:  be in. You gotta go buy real estate, you gotta buy a shitload of electricity.

1077
01:01:58,895 --> 01:02:02,655
Speaker 5:  You gotta work with every like software problems. The stuff does break. Just

1078
01:02:02,655 --> 01:02:06,535
Speaker 5:  like the capital expenditure to do this is so high. Like there's a reason

1079
01:02:06,535 --> 01:02:10,495
Speaker 5:  Electrify America is the big one. It's 'cause Volkswagen had Dieselgate

1080
01:02:10,515 --> 01:02:13,975
Speaker 5:  and that was their make good. That's why Electrify America exists.

1081
01:02:14,085 --> 01:02:14,695
Speaker 5:  Surprised.

1082
01:02:14,695 --> 01:02:17,815
Speaker 7:  Like Shell and Exxon aren't just being like, yeah, all right,

1083
01:02:18,425 --> 01:02:21,245
Speaker 7:  we'll do this. Like just diversifying into it

1084
01:02:21,245 --> 01:02:25,005
Speaker 8:  Somewhere. The CEO of Wawa is like drawing up a pitch right now. Yeah.

1085
01:02:25,005 --> 01:02:27,725
Speaker 7:  Like I got this like Bucky Well Bucky's already has buck's. Superchargers

1086
01:02:28,005 --> 01:02:28,085
Speaker 7:  actually

1087
01:02:28,595 --> 01:02:32,365
Speaker 8:  Bucky's should win. Yeah. I'm good with Bucky's just like owning electric

1088
01:02:32,525 --> 01:02:33,765
Speaker 8:  charging infrastructure in the United States.

1089
01:02:34,205 --> 01:02:38,085
Speaker 5:  I feel like I super know why Shell and Exxon aren't kidding into the charging

1090
01:02:38,115 --> 01:02:40,685
Speaker 7:  Game. Yeah. Yeah. They, they, they don't want anyone to use.

1091
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:43,645
Speaker 5:  They're at my house right now keeping me from selling the Raptor. They're

1092
01:02:43,645 --> 01:02:45,845
Speaker 5:  like, this gets eight miles to the gallon and you're gonna have it forever.

1093
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:49,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah. See I hope the C of Exxon's at my house right now. I have a number

1094
01:02:49,845 --> 01:02:51,045
Speaker 5:  of questions for you too, sir.

1095
01:02:52,915 --> 01:02:55,525
Speaker 5:  Alright, let's take a break. We're gonna wrap this whole thing up in the

1096
01:02:55,725 --> 01:02:56,405
Speaker 5:  lightning around. We'll

1097
01:04:59,725 --> 01:05:01,245
Speaker 5:  adding mobile games to LinkedIn. Did

1098
01:05:01,245 --> 01:05:02,045
Speaker 8:  You see the guy, by the way,

1099
01:06:01,595 --> 01:06:04,445
Speaker 5:  Well, as a person who introduced David to his wife, I can tell you what I

1100
01:06:04,445 --> 01:06:08,045
Speaker 5:  know on B2B sales, which is be hammered on a boat and just

1101
01:06:08,405 --> 01:06:09,565
Speaker 5:  shove David into a girl.

1102
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:14,085
Speaker 5:  Be like, you're gonna have a baby since it's a perfect trash. It worked.

1103
01:06:14,085 --> 01:06:16,165
Speaker 5:  That's a hundred percent what happened. It's

1104
01:06:16,165 --> 01:06:17,605
Speaker 8:  Literally the, that is the story.

1105
01:06:19,505 --> 01:06:23,405
Speaker 5:  Here's what I learned about B2B sales. You need a lot of tequila

1106
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:26,605
Speaker 7:  That tracks that track

1107
01:06:28,555 --> 01:06:32,205
Speaker 5:  Also, LAR, the bigger the boat the better. Yeah. That's what I know about

1108
01:06:32,325 --> 01:06:32,885
Speaker 5:  B2B sales.

1109
01:06:33,405 --> 01:06:37,325
Speaker 8:  Absolutely. I mean, honestly, both of those are probably good sales tactics.

1110
01:06:37,325 --> 01:06:39,725
Speaker 7:  That's right. I was like, yeah. Yeah. Just in general. Those are good sales

1111
01:06:40,005 --> 01:06:40,205
Speaker 7:  tactics

1112
01:06:40,525 --> 01:06:44,005
Speaker 5:  Anyway. LinkedIn is a mobile games fits platform in an effort to make it

1113
01:06:44,005 --> 01:06:47,805
Speaker 5:  stickier. Because the only idea people have on how to

1114
01:06:47,835 --> 01:06:51,605
Speaker 5:  make things sticky and have you come back to them is casual

1115
01:06:51,605 --> 01:06:52,165
Speaker 5:  mobile games.

1116
01:06:52,765 --> 01:06:55,365
Speaker 7:  Consider this. LinkedIn doesn't need to be sticky.

1117
01:06:55,685 --> 01:06:57,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to get at.

1118
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:01,925
Speaker 7:  Like LinkedIn buddies, you're doing fine. Yeah. People need a job. They go

1119
01:07:01,925 --> 01:07:04,885
Speaker 7:  on LinkedIn, they don't need a job, they don't use LinkedIn. It works

1120
01:07:05,265 --> 01:07:08,445
Speaker 5:  If, you find yourself in life being like, ah, I gotta get back on pinpoint

1121
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:12,885
Speaker 5:  and like open, you know, like, reevaluate, throw your phone into the

1122
01:07:12,885 --> 01:07:13,605
Speaker 5:  ocean. What

1123
01:07:13,605 --> 01:07:15,645
Speaker 7:  If it's actually really good? What if it's like wordle?

1124
01:07:18,425 --> 01:07:21,125
Speaker 5:  You can only, you can only play each game once per day and after your daily

1125
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:23,845
Speaker 5:  session you'll get access to your metrics. So it is wordle. It's wordle.

1126
01:07:23,845 --> 01:07:24,565
Speaker 5:  They made a wordle.

1127
01:07:25,665 --> 01:07:28,645
Speaker 8:  Can you imagine like, there's all these people now who are like, you know,

1128
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:31,325
Speaker 8:  I wake up in the morning, I do connections, I do wordle. It's like a huge

1129
01:07:31,325 --> 01:07:35,125
Speaker 8:  success story for the Times. Great job by them. I think if I ever

1130
01:07:35,175 --> 01:07:38,005
Speaker 8:  found myself at a coffee shop and somebody was like, oh, hold on, I gotta

1131
01:07:38,005 --> 01:07:40,885
Speaker 8:  do cross climb for the day. I'd be like, I'm gonna go. Yeah. Like, I'm gonna,

1132
01:07:41,065 --> 01:07:41,565
Speaker 8:  I'm gonna leave.

1133
01:07:42,405 --> 01:07:45,365
Speaker 5:  I Oh, you're, you know too much about B2B. So we're

1134
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:46,205
Speaker 8:  Not going on four dates.

1135
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:53,325
Speaker 5:  It's like the ultimate red flag. Did we find out if the woman

1136
01:07:53,345 --> 01:07:55,725
Speaker 5:  he proposed to said yes? I'm assuming she said yes.

1137
01:07:56,365 --> 01:07:57,285
Speaker 8:  I don't know because

1138
01:07:57,285 --> 01:08:00,045
Speaker 5:  If like the last thing he learned about B2B sales was like, don't take no

1139
01:08:00,045 --> 01:08:01,445
Speaker 5:  for an answer. That's not great.

1140
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:04,245
Speaker 7:  Ooh. Rough.

1141
01:08:04,635 --> 01:08:07,685
Speaker 5:  It's rough. All right. So I promise you we talked about LinkedIn gaming

1142
01:08:08,665 --> 01:08:11,565
Speaker 5:  and I we have in a matter of speaking.

1143
01:08:11,715 --> 01:08:13,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah, you can do it If you want.

1144
01:08:13,305 --> 01:08:17,125
Speaker 5:  All right. I was really stalling in the hopes that Jim Farley, CEO of Ford

1145
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:20,765
Speaker 5:  would call in to sponsor the lightning round. He did not.

1146
01:08:21,745 --> 01:08:25,485
Speaker 5:  Mostly because we published the show after we recorded, so he didn't know

1147
01:08:25,645 --> 01:08:26,405
Speaker 5:  I was waiting for that.

1148
01:08:26,515 --> 01:08:27,165
Speaker 8:  There's that

1149
01:08:27,385 --> 01:08:30,845
Speaker 5:  And I, I didn't text him. Yeah. Jim, quick question. This

1150
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:34,485
Speaker 8:  Lightning round needs to be sponsored by horse girls because of the incredible

1151
01:08:34,725 --> 01:08:38,125
Speaker 8:  slander that we brought to them earlier in the show. I think we need to give

1152
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:39,085
Speaker 8:  them this one. They

1153
01:08:39,085 --> 01:08:40,885
Speaker 15:  Got it. It's all you girl girls.

1154
01:08:41,295 --> 01:08:43,925
Speaker 5:  There was a second one in law school. I think it really cemented the

1155
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:45,725
Speaker 5:  situation for me.

1156
01:08:47,725 --> 01:08:51,285
Speaker 5:  I wasn't a great person for many years. Then

1157
01:08:51,735 --> 01:08:55,085
Speaker 5:  after mastering B2B sales, I got married. There you go.

1158
01:08:55,475 --> 01:08:58,725
Speaker 5:  Alright. Lightning round. We gotta, we, this is important. This one's important.

1159
01:08:59,815 --> 01:09:03,805
Speaker 5:  There is an Apple event next week. Yes. By all accounts, this

1160
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:07,165
Speaker 5:  is new iPads. David, you wrote a spicy headline this week. The last thing

1161
01:09:07,165 --> 01:09:08,725
Speaker 5:  the iPad needs is a spec bump.

1162
01:09:09,075 --> 01:09:09,565
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I

1163
01:09:09,825 --> 01:09:13,325
Speaker 5:  I'd say this is more than a spec bump. We're gonna get ole iPads spec bump.

1164
01:09:13,435 --> 01:09:15,125
Speaker 5:  This is like my dream spec bump.

1165
01:09:15,835 --> 01:09:19,605
Speaker 8:  Sure. Yeah. You and Liam are both gonna be psyched and everyone else on earth

1166
01:09:19,705 --> 01:09:22,645
Speaker 8:  is gonna say, what is Ole? I don't care. Leave

1167
01:09:22,645 --> 01:09:23,525
Speaker 5:  Me alone. Aww.

1168
01:09:25,065 --> 01:09:28,645
Speaker 8:  No, I, I think, I mean we, we've been asking this, what is the

1169
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:32,165
Speaker 8:  iPad for and what, what is Apple trying to do with it? Question for a while.

1170
01:09:32,265 --> 01:09:36,205
Speaker 8:  And I was on the, they just need to make the iPad a touchscreen laptop train

1171
01:09:36,265 --> 01:09:39,965
Speaker 8:  for a long time. I'm, I'm now off that train because

1172
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:44,005
Speaker 8:  the MacBook Air is that, is that thing like, it's not a touchscreen, but

1173
01:09:44,005 --> 01:09:47,525
Speaker 8:  it is. It is a damn good laptop. It is the laptop. People who want laptops

1174
01:09:47,525 --> 01:09:51,325
Speaker 8:  should buy problem solved. The iPad needs to figure out the

1175
01:09:51,325 --> 01:09:55,285
Speaker 8:  other thing that it wants to be. Yeah. And what's interesting is it

1176
01:09:55,285 --> 01:09:59,085
Speaker 8:  seems like, and again, I'm, I'm like a little bit kind of making a mountain

1177
01:09:59,105 --> 01:10:02,965
Speaker 8:  out of a molehill here, but the If, you just look at the invite

1178
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:06,885
Speaker 8:  to the Apple event, it's called Let Loose. And it is just, it's just an Apple

1179
01:10:06,885 --> 01:10:10,605
Speaker 8:  pencil. It's not like hiding that it's an Apple pencil. It just is an Apple

1180
01:10:10,605 --> 01:10:14,525
Speaker 8:  pencil. And to me it's like, okay, if Apple wants this

1181
01:10:14,525 --> 01:10:18,405
Speaker 8:  to work, the thing that it needs to focus on is accessories. Like

1182
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:22,405
Speaker 8:  sell, take the idea of the iPad as just, it's a screen and you

1183
01:10:22,405 --> 01:10:26,365
Speaker 8:  can attach every other piece of the device that you want to it and

1184
01:10:26,365 --> 01:10:29,765
Speaker 8:  take it off as you need it or don't. And

1185
01:10:30,095 --> 01:10:33,925
Speaker 8:  Apple has gone like an inch down this road. They have two different keyboards

1186
01:10:33,945 --> 01:10:36,645
Speaker 8:  for different kinds of people who want different kinds of keyboards. There's

1187
01:10:36,645 --> 01:10:39,405
Speaker 8:  the pencil. Do you remember when they had the smart connector that no one

1188
01:10:39,405 --> 01:10:41,925
Speaker 8:  ever used? Because Apple never opened it up to anybody. That was a thing.

1189
01:10:42,095 --> 01:10:46,085
Speaker 8:  Apple is like, it was cool. Is like this close to being a really

1190
01:10:46,645 --> 01:10:50,405
Speaker 8:  interesting modular accessory system around this really

1191
01:10:50,405 --> 01:10:54,165
Speaker 8:  great tablet and it just, it needs to stop worrying

1192
01:10:54,215 --> 01:10:58,165
Speaker 8:  about having more processing power because it already, it has had

1193
01:10:58,165 --> 01:11:02,125
Speaker 8:  too much processing power for like six years. Yeah. Like no one

1194
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:05,605
Speaker 8:  is using all of the power of their iPad in part because they can't, because

1195
01:11:05,605 --> 01:11:09,525
Speaker 8:  there's not enough powerful software to do it. But also because you're not

1196
01:11:09,525 --> 01:11:13,485
Speaker 8:  giving people the literal physical tools they need to make the most out

1197
01:11:13,485 --> 01:11:16,965
Speaker 8:  of this device. So I think as we go into this event, I'm like,

1198
01:11:17,405 --> 01:11:20,485
Speaker 8:  whatever, I'm sure I'll end up buying an ole iPad because that is like a

1199
01:11:20,805 --> 01:11:21,845
Speaker 8:  sickness I have in my life.

1200
01:11:21,845 --> 01:11:25,725
Speaker 5:  Because you love black levels. I, I, yeah. Do, I mean, infinite contrast

1201
01:11:25,725 --> 01:11:26,005
Speaker 7:  Story

1202
01:11:26,005 --> 01:11:26,405
Speaker 5:  Shows we

1203
01:11:26,405 --> 01:11:29,925
Speaker 8:  Do that. But like, I just, I don't know. I feel like I I'm, we, we've all

1204
01:11:29,925 --> 01:11:33,645
Speaker 8:  sort of gone blue in the face yelling like, what is an iPad actually for

1205
01:11:34,285 --> 01:11:38,205
Speaker 8:  somewhere. Dieter Bone is like shaking his fist at our podcast

1206
01:11:38,255 --> 01:11:42,125
Speaker 8:  right now. But I just like, Apple's like right there and

1207
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:45,685
Speaker 8:  it's like, just go, go finish the thing. Make me some accessories.

1208
01:11:45,855 --> 01:11:47,125
Speaker 8:  Build the iPad out. So

1209
01:11:47,905 --> 01:11:51,885
Speaker 5:  Two things. Rumor is they're gonna put

1210
01:11:51,885 --> 01:11:55,245
Speaker 5:  an M four chip in these iPads, massive

1211
01:11:56,005 --> 01:11:59,165
Speaker 5:  increase in processing power that the thing does not need. Second,

1212
01:12:00,635 --> 01:12:03,645
Speaker 5:  they need to change the software. That's actually what it needs.

1213
01:12:05,265 --> 01:12:09,205
Speaker 5:  The, the hardware ecosystem around it, whatever. Except make

1214
01:12:09,205 --> 01:12:12,765
Speaker 5:  accessory manufacturers make more stuff to make any of that worthwhile. You

1215
01:12:12,765 --> 01:12:16,485
Speaker 5:  need more software capabilities and they can't do that. 'cause

1216
01:12:16,985 --> 01:12:20,525
Speaker 5:  WWC isn't until June. Right. Right. You needed the next version of iOS. What

1217
01:12:20,525 --> 01:12:23,965
Speaker 5:  can they show us besides an OLED screen? An

1218
01:12:24,135 --> 01:12:25,005
Speaker 7:  Infor processor

1219
01:12:25,065 --> 01:12:28,445
Speaker 5:  And Right. And a a d like a chip dye diagram.

1220
01:12:28,835 --> 01:12:32,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Of the M four being like, look at this neural engine. Well

1221
01:12:32,835 --> 01:12:33,685
Speaker 5:  read it and weep.

1222
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:36,605
Speaker 8:  Yeah. There's gonna be a lot of unlabeled graphs. Yeah.

1223
01:12:36,755 --> 01:12:40,405
Speaker 7:  There's gonna be, oh we're, there's a, there's a pencil and it's gonna have

1224
01:12:40,405 --> 01:12:43,565
Speaker 7:  replaceable nubs, but like Sure. Cooler

1225
01:12:43,715 --> 01:12:47,605
Speaker 7:  replaceable nubs in the current pencil has and there's a, there's

1226
01:12:47,605 --> 01:12:51,485
Speaker 7:  an aluminum magic keyboard that's also

1227
01:12:51,485 --> 01:12:52,165
Speaker 7:  not software.

1228
01:12:52,425 --> 01:12:56,285
Speaker 5:  The, the rumor from Markman, the rumor from Mark Urman at

1229
01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:59,405
Speaker 5:  Bloomberg is that it will be, it will lean into being a laptop or the pro

1230
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:02,685
Speaker 5:  will lean into being a laptop. I mean, I expect a full model refresh, like

1231
01:13:02,685 --> 01:13:06,325
Speaker 5:  the iPad model range right now is outta control. It's, yes. So they should

1232
01:13:06,385 --> 01:13:10,165
Speaker 5:  end with an iPad that is cheap that makes sense for students. An

1233
01:13:10,235 --> 01:13:14,005
Speaker 5:  iPad, air that is like the mainstream one. An iPad Pro that is

1234
01:13:14,005 --> 01:13:17,725
Speaker 5:  expensive and has all the stuff Yeah, sure. That, that's theoretically what

1235
01:13:17,725 --> 01:13:20,605
Speaker 5:  they have now, but it's all very blurry. Yeah. And then a pencil that works

1236
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:24,445
Speaker 5:  with everything one assumes and maybe some of these keyboard cases

1237
01:13:24,465 --> 01:13:25,365
Speaker 5:  and whatever else that work with

1238
01:13:25,365 --> 01:13:28,965
Speaker 7:  Everybody. I hope it still has a lightning port in the eraser.

1239
01:13:28,965 --> 01:13:30,285
Speaker 5:  The the base one. Yeah.

1240
01:13:30,885 --> 01:13:34,445
Speaker 7:  I, I like, I I just hope that they, that they just whiff it

1241
01:13:35,425 --> 01:13:35,965
Speaker 7:  on a port.

1242
01:13:36,275 --> 01:13:38,605
Speaker 5:  There's like one last lightning port. Yeah. You're

1243
01:13:38,605 --> 01:13:39,045
Speaker 7:  Just, wha

1244
01:13:40,245 --> 01:13:44,205
Speaker 5:  I just think the future of the iPad Pro should

1245
01:13:44,205 --> 01:13:48,165
Speaker 5:  be, this is a modular Mac and you should just let the iPad,

1246
01:13:48,185 --> 01:13:51,085
Speaker 5:  the base model iPad be like, this runs Disney plus.

1247
01:13:51,685 --> 01:13:54,365
Speaker 8:  I just wanna point out that you, you're, you sort of like, you just hand

1248
01:13:54,365 --> 01:13:57,925
Speaker 8:  literally hand waved away the iPad that everyone buys and uses.

1249
01:13:58,805 --> 01:14:00,085
Speaker 5:  I think people buy the cheap one.

1250
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:04,165
Speaker 8:  That's what I'm saying. The iPad Pro is, is not the most

1251
01:14:04,165 --> 01:14:06,325
Speaker 8:  important iPad by a million miles.

1252
01:14:06,955 --> 01:14:10,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I but again, I think the cheap one runs Disney plus. Sure.

1253
01:14:10,925 --> 01:14:14,245
Speaker 5:  I think, I think that's what it's for. I like, here's the cheapest TV in

1254
01:14:14,245 --> 01:14:14,565
Speaker 5:  your house.

1255
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:17,245
Speaker 5:  Fine. The iPad.

1256
01:14:17,545 --> 01:14:19,325
Speaker 7:  No, there's a Westing house you for

1257
01:14:19,325 --> 01:14:22,685
Speaker 5:  Like 90 bucks. That's exactly, you signed up for a bank account at Chase

1258
01:14:22,745 --> 01:14:26,445
Speaker 5:  and they gave you a tv. Like Sure, sure. But like, that's what I mean. Portable,

1259
01:14:26,445 --> 01:14:27,525
Speaker 7:  Portable tv. But

1260
01:14:27,525 --> 01:14:31,085
Speaker 5:  Like, yeah, this is like, here's this content consumption device

1261
01:14:31,915 --> 01:14:35,645
Speaker 5:  that occasionally lets you tap out an email. It's like, that's the base model

1262
01:14:35,835 --> 01:14:39,685
Speaker 5:  iPad. I don't fine. Like let that thing be

1263
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:43,285
Speaker 5:  this weird appliance. I'm just saying for everything else to solve that

1264
01:14:43,285 --> 01:14:47,045
Speaker 5:  problem of like, what is this for? Actually should just be a

1265
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:50,645
Speaker 5:  Mac. Like they should just let you run Mac apps on it at this point. Like

1266
01:14:50,785 --> 01:14:51,205
Speaker 5:  why not?

1267
01:14:51,525 --> 01:14:55,365
Speaker 8:  I do agree with that. I don't think it should be exclusively that, but I

1268
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:59,245
Speaker 8:  think that is one thing it ought to do. Right. In the way that

1269
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:03,125
Speaker 8:  you can now run some iOS and iPad apps on your

1270
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:06,765
Speaker 8:  Mac. It should, it should pull in both directions at this point.

1271
01:15:07,195 --> 01:15:10,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I I don't think Apple will ever let it go. 'cause then they will have

1272
01:15:10,165 --> 01:15:14,005
Speaker 5:  made a touchscreen Mac by accident and that really implicates a lot of things

1273
01:15:14,005 --> 01:15:17,085
Speaker 5:  about everything they've ever said. But I just, I just dunno why you wouldn't

1274
01:15:17,325 --> 01:15:20,925
Speaker 5:  converge the iPad Pro and like the

1275
01:15:20,925 --> 01:15:22,485
Speaker 5:  cheapest MacBook

1276
01:15:22,505 --> 01:15:25,685
Speaker 7:  Pro because one time years ago they said they will never do that.

1277
01:15:26,545 --> 01:15:30,285
Speaker 7:  And now like, we'll really like ruthlessly mock them when they do it.

1278
01:15:30,685 --> 01:15:32,765
Speaker 5:  I mean, apple says they're not gonna do things until they do it all the

1279
01:15:32,765 --> 01:15:33,365
Speaker 7:  Time. That's

1280
01:15:33,365 --> 01:15:37,205
Speaker 8:  True. I do think If, you If you look at your Mac and you think about

1281
01:15:37,235 --> 01:15:40,285
Speaker 8:  what it would be like to use Mac os as a touchscreen.

1282
01:15:41,035 --> 01:15:44,965
Speaker 8:  It's a nightmare. Like just think about the amount of time you spend

1283
01:15:44,965 --> 01:15:48,845
Speaker 8:  in a menu bar and how it would feel on a 9.7 inch screen

1284
01:15:48,865 --> 01:15:51,965
Speaker 8:  to try to poke at those little icons in the corner. Like bad times.

1285
01:15:52,065 --> 01:15:55,725
Speaker 7:  Oh, no, no, no. It's, it's a great time. I'm, I'm, I'm checking out this,

1286
01:15:55,725 --> 01:15:59,565
Speaker 7:  this product right now from IN ao, I think that's how you say it. IN

1287
01:15:59,585 --> 01:16:03,525
Speaker 7:  ao they do like game little handheld game consoles and they have

1288
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:07,045
Speaker 7:  one called the Flip Ds and it's got Micro, it's got

1289
01:16:07,725 --> 01:16:11,685
Speaker 7:  Microsoft built in. Yeah. It's just a tiny DS shaped Windows

1290
01:16:11,715 --> 01:16:15,485
Speaker 7:  machine. Oh no. And the only way I can like turn it on because

1291
01:16:16,085 --> 01:16:19,805
Speaker 7:  hardware wise gorgeous. Don't worry. Reviews are coming software

1292
01:16:19,805 --> 01:16:23,685
Speaker 7:  wise. It's just Windows and they didn't really do anything. So,

1293
01:16:23,685 --> 01:16:27,205
Speaker 7:  and there's no keyboard. So you have to like, you have to like fi I have

1294
01:16:27,205 --> 01:16:30,565
Speaker 7:  to use my pinky. I can't use my regular finger. I have to use my pinky to

1295
01:16:30,565 --> 01:16:34,325
Speaker 7:  like hit a button to turn on a a, a keyboard. And then

1296
01:16:34,395 --> 01:16:37,845
Speaker 7:  it's beautiful. It works every time. It takes 20 minutes.

1297
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:39,325
Speaker 7:  I love it.

1298
01:16:39,715 --> 01:16:41,925
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I mean that's, that's the Apple experience I'm looking for.

1299
01:16:41,925 --> 01:16:45,645
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That's what I want from Apple too. Everyone should let me have like

1300
01:16:45,925 --> 01:16:49,325
Speaker 7:  a tiny, tiny screens that I've used my pinky to, to work on.

1301
01:16:49,555 --> 01:16:53,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And every time you push that button, apple makes $20. Yeah.

1302
01:16:54,065 --> 01:16:55,085
Speaker 7:  We all win. All

1303
01:16:55,085 --> 01:16:57,125
Speaker 5:  Right. Lightning around Crans. What you got?

1304
01:16:57,395 --> 01:17:00,845
Speaker 7:  Okay. Do you guys remember, do you remember when Razor Made made their mask?

1305
01:17:02,355 --> 01:17:04,005
Speaker 5:  They, they made like three masks.

1306
01:17:04,345 --> 01:17:08,245
Speaker 7:  Oh, sorry. Do you remember when they made the Zephyr? Yes. And, and and

1307
01:17:08,245 --> 01:17:12,165
Speaker 7:  it was kind of, see Yeah. And, and it had the RGB, they actually, they

1308
01:17:12,325 --> 01:17:12,765
Speaker 7:  appeared at our,

1309
01:17:13,105 --> 01:17:16,245
Speaker 5:  Our tenure. They did. And they refused to answer any questions about the

1310
01:17:16,245 --> 01:17:17,765
Speaker 5:  medical backing of this this device.

1311
01:17:17,915 --> 01:17:21,365
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And, and shocker, they

1312
01:17:21,665 --> 01:17:25,645
Speaker 7:  didn't have backing this, this,

1313
01:17:25,645 --> 01:17:29,485
Speaker 7:  this mask. They, they said had like N95 grade filters and stuff. That

1314
01:17:29,485 --> 01:17:33,365
Speaker 7:  was just a lie. Or it was not the

1315
01:17:33,365 --> 01:17:36,045
Speaker 7:  truth. Maybe, maybe a lie is too hard.

1316
01:17:36,645 --> 01:17:40,565
Speaker 8:  N95 grade is an amazing phrase. Yeah.

1317
01:17:40,565 --> 01:17:43,085
Speaker 8:  It's like, it's not N95. It's like N95 ish.

1318
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:47,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And, and that's not anything like, that's

1319
01:17:47,685 --> 01:17:51,005
Speaker 7:  just, that's just not a thing. You know, it's,

1320
01:17:51,865 --> 01:17:54,685
Speaker 7:  and so they are now being required to fork over

1321
01:17:54,945 --> 01:17:58,205
Speaker 7:  $1.1 million in refunds to customers.

1322
01:17:58,865 --> 01:18:02,405
Speaker 7:  And I think the real question here is who are the people who

1323
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:06,605
Speaker 7:  bought the Zephyr mask and are now getting their one point their their refund?

1324
01:18:06,605 --> 01:18:08,965
Speaker 7:  Because you did that.

1325
01:18:09,445 --> 01:18:12,485
Speaker 8:  Yeah. That means like thousands of people bought that thing. Wasn't it only

1326
01:18:12,485 --> 01:18:13,165
Speaker 8:  like a hundred bucks?

1327
01:18:13,985 --> 01:18:17,965
Speaker 7:  It it was, it was more expensive than that. Oh, okay. Oh no. It started at

1328
01:18:17,965 --> 01:18:19,925
Speaker 7:  a hundred dollars. Yeah. So,

1329
01:18:21,945 --> 01:18:25,805
Speaker 7:  but still you bought it and I should, I haven't seen you wear

1330
01:18:25,805 --> 01:18:28,725
Speaker 7:  it. I feel like I would've, if that many people bought it, I would've seen

1331
01:18:28,725 --> 01:18:31,965
Speaker 7:  at least one on the street. The only one I ever saw was at the, our, our

1332
01:18:32,265 --> 01:18:36,245
Speaker 7:  10 year party. And it was the razor guy wearing it.

1333
01:18:36,315 --> 01:18:40,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And Cameron and our health reporter at the time, Nicole

1334
01:18:40,045 --> 01:18:43,645
Speaker 5:  Wetsman, who by the way, joined The Verge before the pandemic and then was

1335
01:18:43,645 --> 01:18:45,965
Speaker 5:  our health reporter during a global pandemic. Like

1336
01:18:45,965 --> 01:18:47,005
Speaker 7:  Right before the pandemic.

1337
01:18:47,105 --> 01:18:50,285
Speaker 5:  It was not, I feel like every time I see Nicole for the rest of my life,

1338
01:18:50,365 --> 01:18:53,965
Speaker 5:  I, I'm so sorry. Yeah. But anyway, but Nicole was there

1339
01:18:54,385 --> 01:18:57,885
Speaker 5:  and she was like, so is this certified? Is it actually in like over and over

1340
01:18:57,885 --> 01:19:01,525
Speaker 5:  again? And they're like, we'll get to it. It was a very weird moment at our

1341
01:19:01,525 --> 01:19:04,645
Speaker 5:  party, I must say. It was super weird when you think about The Verge party,

1342
01:19:04,645 --> 01:19:06,685
Speaker 5:  you think about our health reporters being like, are you lying?

1343
01:19:09,025 --> 01:19:11,685
Speaker 5:  That's, that's what, and then there's tequila. Yeah.

1344
01:19:13,285 --> 01:19:14,405
Speaker 7:  I mean that was exactly the party. It was

1345
01:19:14,405 --> 01:19:18,285
Speaker 5:  Great weird product. Weird product, weird moment in his,

1346
01:19:18,385 --> 01:19:21,765
Speaker 5:  the global history to be like this. RGB

1347
01:19:22,085 --> 01:19:23,285
Speaker 5:  N95 is a fake,

1348
01:19:23,785 --> 01:19:25,005
Speaker 7:  It had like speakers in it.

1349
01:19:25,185 --> 01:19:26,165
Speaker 5:  It was a very product.

1350
01:19:26,185 --> 01:19:28,845
Speaker 7:  God, it was, it was see-through that was the part that was,

1351
01:19:30,305 --> 01:19:34,005
Speaker 8:  It really is a very specific artifact of a very specific time. That thing.

1352
01:19:34,115 --> 01:19:37,045
Speaker 8:  Yeah. You will look at that thing and you will always know exactly when it

1353
01:19:37,045 --> 01:19:39,045
Speaker 8:  came out and exactly who made it and exactly

1354
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:39,725
Speaker 5:  What happened to it.

1355
01:19:39,835 --> 01:19:41,685
Speaker 8:  Like it, it tells a whole story.

1356
01:19:42,025 --> 01:19:45,445
Speaker 5:  All right. I have a lightning round item here. Yeah. It's about Instagram

1357
01:19:45,445 --> 01:19:49,365
Speaker 5:  algorithm updates and what it means in the TikTok ban. Yeah. Da da da. But

1358
01:19:49,365 --> 01:19:51,965
Speaker 5:  then I'm just looking at this headline that says, Google is building a fart

1359
01:19:51,965 --> 01:19:52,725
Speaker 5:  button into Android.

1360
01:19:55,585 --> 01:19:59,405
Speaker 5:  And it is, they're putting a soundboard into the phone

1361
01:19:59,705 --> 01:20:00,605
Speaker 5:  app of Android.

1362
01:20:01,345 --> 01:20:01,565
Speaker 7:  Yes.

1363
01:20:02,425 --> 01:20:06,365
Speaker 5:  So you get what are called audio emoji so

1364
01:20:06,365 --> 01:20:08,445
Speaker 5:  that you can just play them during phone calls.

1365
01:20:09,145 --> 01:20:10,565
Speaker 7:  Oh, I shouldn't have that power.

1366
01:20:11,105 --> 01:20:14,845
Speaker 5:  You get clapping, laughing, crying, which is a literal sad,

1367
01:20:15,045 --> 01:20:18,885
Speaker 5:  trombone partying, a drum sting, which is

1368
01:20:19,985 --> 01:20:21,165
Speaker 5:  and then fart sound.

1369
01:20:22,595 --> 01:20:25,565
Speaker 8:  This is, and I, I I want to, I wanna not

1370
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:30,345
Speaker 8:  be hyperbolic here. This is the worst idea I've ever heard from

1371
01:20:30,385 --> 01:20:31,865
Speaker 8:  a technology company maybe

1372
01:20:31,935 --> 01:20:32,945
Speaker 7:  Ever in history.

1373
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:37,265
Speaker 5:  It's like, do you remember when Google's last idea about the phone was like,

1374
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:40,025
Speaker 5:  we'll, have the robot make reservations for you? They're like, no, no, no.

1375
01:20:40,025 --> 01:20:43,105
Speaker 5:  Dude. They like, you should be able to wmp wmp your friends in the middle

1376
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:43,705
Speaker 5:  of a phone

1377
01:20:43,825 --> 01:20:47,585
Speaker 7:  Call. I I love that you can just be on a phone, phone call and be like,

1378
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:49,985
Speaker 7:  like that's great. This is also,

1379
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:52,985
Speaker 8:  It's very good. What this reminds me of is like, you know, when the apple

1380
01:20:52,985 --> 01:20:56,625
Speaker 8:  rolled out the reactions thing in FaceTime and so everybody was,

1381
01:20:57,045 --> 01:21:00,665
Speaker 8:  do you would like do the an accidental a thumbs up on camera? Yes. And it

1382
01:21:00,665 --> 01:21:04,625
Speaker 8:  would in some horrifically inappropriate moment, do like

1383
01:21:05,385 --> 01:21:08,905
Speaker 8:  fireworks explosions behind you or like a really happy thumbs up or whatever.

1384
01:21:09,135 --> 01:21:11,945
Speaker 8:  This is going to be that. Because I guarantee you Google's gonna put this

1385
01:21:11,945 --> 01:21:15,745
Speaker 8:  button in a place that is too easy to find and people are going to be having

1386
01:21:15,745 --> 01:21:19,505
Speaker 8:  like, you know, hard conversations with their boss or their family or

1387
01:21:19,745 --> 01:21:23,545
Speaker 8:  whatever. And all of a sudden they're going to, their face is gonna tap a

1388
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,225
Speaker 8:  button of their phone and it's gonna go, w

1389
01:21:25,445 --> 01:21:25,665
Speaker 5:  Wa

1390
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:27,305
Speaker 7:  Like,

1391
01:21:27,535 --> 01:21:28,825
Speaker 8:  This is not a good idea.

1392
01:21:29,425 --> 01:21:33,185
Speaker 5:  I love it. Like the fact that we haven't had soundboards built into the

1393
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:33,905
Speaker 5:  default dialers.

1394
01:21:34,455 --> 01:21:36,145
Speaker 7:  It's just why weren't we doing that

1395
01:21:36,315 --> 01:21:37,545
Speaker 5:  Audio emojis just

1396
01:21:37,545 --> 01:21:40,385
Speaker 8:  In case you wanted to make sure no one ever makes phone calls ever again.

1397
01:21:41,085 --> 01:21:41,905
Speaker 8:  Here's this. Yeah,

1398
01:21:42,135 --> 01:21:45,385
Speaker 5:  It's very good. I'm hoping they demo this on stage at io. I like if they

1399
01:21:45,615 --> 01:21:49,385
Speaker 5:  take a huge chunk of time at IO to be like, we've invented audio emojis.

1400
01:21:50,325 --> 01:21:52,065
Speaker 5:  You can make fart sounds during phone calls,

1401
01:21:52,315 --> 01:21:53,185
Speaker 7:  Hyper realistic

1402
01:21:53,185 --> 01:21:56,065
Speaker 5:  Fart sounds. This is what it's for. Surprise and delight your customer. This

1403
01:21:56,065 --> 01:21:59,985
Speaker 5:  is why we make the technology. Billions of dollars have gone into the,

1404
01:22:00,005 --> 01:22:03,865
Speaker 5:  the mobile phone supply chain. The, so the software,

1405
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:07,985
Speaker 5:  the open source development of Android itself. Billions of dollars,

1406
01:22:08,825 --> 01:22:12,345
Speaker 5:  thousands of years of human effort. You know, cumulatively we built these

1407
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:15,905
Speaker 5:  networks. 5G is a pH phenomenon

1408
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:18,025
Speaker 5:  and now you can just make fart sounds.

1409
01:22:19,045 --> 01:22:23,025
Speaker 7:  You don't even have to use your mouth like innovation. Yeah. I love

1410
01:22:23,025 --> 01:22:24,985
Speaker 5:  It. Can I tell you yet one more story for my youth?

1411
01:22:25,135 --> 01:22:26,385
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Is it a fart story?

1412
01:22:26,765 --> 01:22:28,025
Speaker 5:  No. Well it's sort of, it is in

1413
01:22:28,025 --> 01:22:29,185
Speaker 7:  Its way adjacent. Okay.

1414
01:22:29,505 --> 01:22:32,185
Speaker 5:  I had a remote controlled speaker that made swear words and fart sounds.

1415
01:22:32,325 --> 01:22:36,185
Speaker 5:  Yes. And i's super hid. One in that like the

1416
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:39,145
Speaker 5:  balcony of the room that we had our high school morning meeting from.

1417
01:22:41,085 --> 01:22:43,185
Speaker 5:  And we just ruined that meeting for weeks.

1418
01:22:45,935 --> 01:22:46,225
Speaker 8:  It's

1419
01:22:46,225 --> 01:22:47,505
Speaker 7:  Good work. I mean, that's what you're supposed to

1420
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:49,145
Speaker 5:  Do. I got suspended from high school, like a lot,

1421
01:22:51,015 --> 01:22:52,345
Speaker 5:  like all time records, but like

1422
01:22:52,765 --> 01:22:53,385
Speaker 7:  For good. Cause

1423
01:22:53,645 --> 01:22:56,985
Speaker 5:  My dad was like, are you gonna go to school? And I was like, well I'm getting

1424
01:22:56,985 --> 01:23:00,025
Speaker 5:  good grades. He was like, fine. You just like, That was the, that was the

1425
01:23:00,025 --> 01:23:03,865
Speaker 5:  trade in my household. You got good grades. My dad was like, I'll

1426
01:23:03,865 --> 01:23:06,885
Speaker 5:  don't talk to your principal again. Yeah. It was a small town. It was a private

1427
01:23:06,885 --> 01:23:10,125
Speaker 5:  school. There was nowhere for me to go. Alright. I think that's the first

1428
01:23:10,195 --> 01:23:10,485
Speaker 5:  cast.

1429
01:23:14,315 --> 01:23:15,245
Speaker 5:  Stay in school. Kids

1430
01:23:17,555 --> 01:23:19,445
Speaker 5:  just like, yeah. Love a fart button. Try hard.

1431
01:23:21,785 --> 01:23:23,805
Speaker 5:  No, that's it. That's the first test. Next week is gonna be a huge week.

1432
01:23:23,805 --> 01:23:26,165
Speaker 5:  We got an Apple event. We got this. We're gonna find out what's gonna happen

1433
01:23:26,165 --> 01:23:30,085
Speaker 5:  with the iPad. This Google trial closing arguments are today,

1434
01:23:30,085 --> 01:23:32,965
Speaker 5:  we're gonna hear a lot about what's happening very soon. 'cause that's a

1435
01:23:32,965 --> 01:23:36,885
Speaker 5:  bench trial. A lot of tech news is coming and then soon after

1436
01:23:36,885 --> 01:23:40,645
Speaker 5:  that IO starts and developer season is off the races. So take a breath,

1437
01:23:41,675 --> 01:23:45,405
Speaker 5:  pull over in your car. Just think about what it means to be a large

1438
01:23:45,405 --> 01:23:45,965
Speaker 5:  action model.

1439
01:23:47,585 --> 01:23:50,005
Speaker 5:  It means nothing. It actually doesn't mean anything at this point in time.

1440
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:54,165
Speaker 5:  The the, it's a three. I had to work so hard not to make a fart noise of

1441
01:23:54,165 --> 01:23:57,245
Speaker 5:  that silence. See, that would've been perfect. Just, oh my god. All right.

1442
01:23:57,245 --> 01:23:58,645
Speaker 5:  That's it. That's our chest bucket.

1443
01:24:03,065 --> 01:24:06,245
Speaker 1:  And that's it for The Vergecast this week. Hey, we'd love to hear from you.
