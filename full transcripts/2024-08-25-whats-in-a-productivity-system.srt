Description: You can learn a lot about somebody just by learning about how they get things done. Are they the sort of person who might have a perfectly color-coded email inbox, a flawlessly organized to-do list, and what’s that, they just sent you a calendar invite for happy hour next week? Or are they more likely to have a giant pile of sticky notes they never look at, a computer desktop with so many files you can’t even see the wallpaper, and today’s main tasks written on their arm? Neither is wrong, but they’re very different.
On this episode of The Vergecast, the second in our three-part miniseries about work and productivity and how to get more done in a digital world, we decide to get to know our colleagues in a new way: by asking them to share their own productivity systems. We didn’t give them much specific instruction or homework, other than to come ready to answer a question: how do you get stuff done? Eight Verge staffers showed up, with eight very different ideas about what being productive means and how best to pull it off. Along the way, we found some ideas to steal, a few new apps and tools to try, and a lot of new thoughts about our co-workers.
If you want to know more about the things we discuss in this episode, here are a few links to get you started:

00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:06,045
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Never Ending

3
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:09,725
Speaker 2:  to-Do Lists. I'm a friend David Pierce and this is the second

4
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:13,365
Speaker 2:  episode in our three part mini series, all about productivity

5
00:00:13,795 --> 00:00:17,645
Speaker 2:  defined as loosely as possible. If you missed last week's episode, I

6
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:20,925
Speaker 2:  talked to Laura May Martin, who is like Google's internal

7
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:24,685
Speaker 2:  productivity guru. We talked all about tools and

8
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:28,645
Speaker 2:  hustle bros and process and what it means to be productive

9
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,525
Speaker 2:  without totally losing your mind this week, I wanna do something

10
00:00:32,525 --> 00:00:36,165
Speaker 2:  completely different. I have this theory that You can tell a lot about a

11
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:39,365
Speaker 2:  person just by understanding how they manage their life.

12
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:43,765
Speaker 2:  Are they super duper organized with a beautiful, perfect

13
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:47,885
Speaker 2:  foolproof system for making sure everything gets done? Do they

14
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:51,245
Speaker 2:  just totally fly by the seat of their pants, trust their memory, and hope

15
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:55,165
Speaker 2:  for the best? Do they like digital tools or pen and paper? Ai? No

16
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:59,245
Speaker 2:  ai. It's all very revealing honestly. And it's

17
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:02,925
Speaker 2:  really fun to talk to people about. So today we're going to use this

18
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:06,685
Speaker 2:  episode as an excuse to get to know a few of my coworkers. We reached

19
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:09,965
Speaker 2:  out to a bunch of folks on the Verges staff and asked them to come on the

20
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:13,725
Speaker 2:  show and tell us about their productivity systems, however they want to define.

21
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:17,645
Speaker 2:  That phrase was fine by me. My goal is to learn a bunch

22
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,965
Speaker 2:  of new ideas, steal a few for myself, and also maybe

23
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:25,125
Speaker 2:  psychoanalyze my coworkers. At the end of it, I'll share mine too,

24
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:29,165
Speaker 2:  but I'm gonna go last, so we're gonna get into all of it. But before we do,

25
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:33,045
Speaker 2:  I have to go find my notes on who exactly we're talking to. And spoiler

26
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:36,885
Speaker 2:  alert for my system. That's not that easy right now. This is The Vergecast.

27
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:37,885
Speaker 2:  We'll be right back.

28
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:24,875
Speaker 4:  productivity systems, one for work and one for at home.

29
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:26,995
Speaker 4:  Which would you prefer to hear about or both?

30
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:30,955
Speaker 2:  Well, first I have a question, which is why think of those as separate things?

31
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:34,275
Speaker 2:  What does it help you to differentiate those so completely?

32
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:38,675
Speaker 4:  Yeah, totally. Because then like I can do things

33
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:42,795
Speaker 4:  on the weekend without thinking about them as work stuff and

34
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:47,675
Speaker 4:  my personal productivity system links in pretty closely to how my

35
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:51,515
Speaker 4:  wife does it as well. So we can kind of share tasks and

36
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:55,675
Speaker 4:  language and communications that way. So that's like

37
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,725
Speaker 4:  personal stuff. And then my work stuff is purely work stuff and

38
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:03,725
Speaker 4:  you know, I can add specific reminders for work. Things that

39
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,965
Speaker 4:  don't muck up my personal reminders. It's kind of a way for me to, to keep

40
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:07,365
Speaker 4:  it separate.

41
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:10,605
Speaker 2:  Okay. So let's start with the personal one. How does that work?

42
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:14,845
Speaker 4:  So we've are both fully in the Apple ecosystem

43
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:18,685
Speaker 4:  and So I rely a lot on Apple reminders and Apple

44
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:22,285
Speaker 4:  Notes and Apple Calendar for reminders.

45
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:26,445
Speaker 4:  I have my own personal set of reminders and we do a set of shared reminders,

46
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:30,365
Speaker 4:  which is super useful for like weekend tasks or

47
00:03:30,985 --> 00:03:34,485
Speaker 4:  you know, remembering to reach out to X, Y, or Z person for their birthday.

48
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:38,285
Speaker 4:  Stuff like that. We have a calendar system

49
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:42,525
Speaker 4:  that allows us to, like if one of us has a call, we put

50
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:46,285
Speaker 4:  it on our shared calendar so the other person knows like, oh, maybe

51
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:51,125
Speaker 4:  I'll not be in the office at that time. Or Oh, I need to remember to be there

52
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:54,645
Speaker 4:  at this time for this thing. And we use Apple Notes

53
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:59,285
Speaker 4:  to, we keep a, this is one of my favorite things that we do. We keep a

54
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:02,085
Speaker 4:  running list of stuff throughout the day that we wanna tell each other about.

55
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:06,045
Speaker 4:  And then at like the dinner table or over lunch, we just go over our

56
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,605
Speaker 4:  bullets of like, oh, I saw this funny thing on the internet, or Oh we need

57
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:13,165
Speaker 4:  to talk to our family about X, Y, Z thing. It's

58
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,205
Speaker 4:  been super clutch.

59
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:16,925
Speaker 2:  That is the most adorable thing I've ever heard in my entire life, Jay.

60
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:20,285
Speaker 4:  We've been doing it for years. It is so awesome.

61
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:24,445
Speaker 4:  It's like so, so, so useful. And I think even if we didn't

62
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:28,245
Speaker 4:  have, like let's say we stopped using iPhones, which I don't anticipate

63
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:30,845
Speaker 4:  we'll be doing anytime soon, we'd probably just build like a shared Google

64
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:32,565
Speaker 4:  doc or something like that because like

65
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:36,605
Speaker 2:  Why share it though? Doesn't it remove all of the surprise and fun of bringing

66
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:40,085
Speaker 2:  your topics to each other when You can see the list? Well

67
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:43,685
Speaker 4:  We sometimes write like, you know, a single note or like a single word or

68
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:47,605
Speaker 4:  like maybe just include the link but the link is so giant and

69
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:50,245
Speaker 4:  gross that you can't tell what it is right immediately. And

70
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:53,525
Speaker 2:  So she'll just put in like pants and you get to spend the whole day being

71
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:54,445
Speaker 2:  like what is pants about and

72
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:57,525
Speaker 4:  What is pants? Yeah, sometimes. Okay, I love this. My wife, my wife's very

73
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:01,445
Speaker 4:  good at using acronyms for names and so usually I

74
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:04,525
Speaker 4:  know what they are but sometimes it's a surprise when like I didn't get the

75
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:04,805
Speaker 4:  right person.

76
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:11,045
Speaker 2:  Okay. And all of this is like shared, just shared between the

77
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,645
Speaker 2:  two of you. So you have this like whole collaborative system?

78
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:18,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean for like notes what's kind of useful about

79
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:22,525
Speaker 4:  it is we delete things off the note and they just go away

80
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:25,165
Speaker 4:  'cause it's just like a series of bullets that we're like deleting it, adding

81
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:29,085
Speaker 4:  to over and over and over and over for reminders. We have a bunch of like

82
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:33,205
Speaker 4:  shared reminders that like are scheduled on a weekly or monthly basis

83
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:37,205
Speaker 4:  or whatever. Like every Sunday we have a reminder to vacuum. Whether or

84
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:40,765
Speaker 4:  not that happens is a choice that we make because like we decide we do have

85
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:43,525
Speaker 4:  time to vacuum this weekend or we skip it and we push it another weekend.

86
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:48,245
Speaker 4:  And then the calendar is just a, a shared calendar of reminders and dates

87
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:50,485
Speaker 4:  and and all the stuff you need a calendar for.

88
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:54,645
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. So what about the work system? That's a surprisingly

89
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:58,285
Speaker 2:  like tight, simple personal system. Is is work as

90
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,485
Speaker 2:  as clean and perfect?

91
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:04,125
Speaker 4:  Mm. I keep it pretty simple at work too. So my work

92
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:08,405
Speaker 4:  reminder system is tick tick. Like I just use an entirely separate reminders

93
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:12,085
Speaker 4:  app. I love Tick Tick primarily because You can type like

94
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:16,125
Speaker 4:  get draft to David by 4:00 PM and it will know

95
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:20,365
Speaker 4:  everything I need to do there in terms of like making a 4:00 PM reminder

96
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:24,245
Speaker 4:  or making it happen today. If I needed to get you a draft every

97
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:27,365
Speaker 4:  week, I would add every week and it does it every week and like all that

98
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:31,285
Speaker 4:  stuff is just super fast and super easy and allows me to jot

99
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:34,565
Speaker 4:  things down like the moment I think of them, So I don't lose track of them.

100
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:39,005
Speaker 4:  We use Google Calendar here at The Verge and So I use

101
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:43,005
Speaker 4:  that for scheduling things on my calendar. And then I also kind

102
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:46,725
Speaker 4:  of live and die by my email and I try really hard to keep

103
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:50,725
Speaker 4:  inbox zero. I've, it's sometimes I'll end the day with like three,

104
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,765
Speaker 4:  I don't know if you've seen Andrew Bosworth at Meta, he talks about Inbox

105
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:58,725
Speaker 4:  10, which is actually kind of a useful system where there's not the pressure

106
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:02,685
Speaker 4:  of like always getting to exactly zero at the end of the day.

107
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:06,925
Speaker 4:  But thinking that as a to do list keeping, maybe just a couple things

108
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:10,565
Speaker 4:  you need to do in there, but otherwise like replying to something right away

109
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:13,965
Speaker 4:  or archiving it right away. It's pretty much what I always try and do.

110
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:18,085
Speaker 2:  Okay. So again, the system makes a lot of sense to me. The only thing

111
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:22,285
Speaker 2:  I'm tripped up on is it feels like you've given yourself so many things

112
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:26,205
Speaker 2:  to check and like I spend all of my time obsessively looking for one to do

113
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:28,965
Speaker 2:  list that does everything because I'm like, dear God, I can barely remember

114
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:32,925
Speaker 2:  to open this one app and look at it often enough. You've given yourself like

115
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:37,125
Speaker 2:  six. Are you, are you just good about opening and checking

116
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:37,605
Speaker 2:  these things?

117
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:42,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean I think of them all as like they're my separate spaces where

118
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:46,485
Speaker 4:  I do certain tasks in certain places and

119
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:50,325
Speaker 4:  sometimes every once in a while it gets a little mixed up. But it's a

120
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:54,285
Speaker 4:  system I've used for a few years at this point. And so like maybe if

121
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:56,805
Speaker 4:  it's messy I'm just used to it at this point.

122
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:00,845
Speaker 2:  All right, well you have way too healthy a relationship with your productivity

123
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:03,605
Speaker 2:  tools. I find this is, this is very annoying and frustrating and making me

124
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:07,445
Speaker 2:  feel better about myself. So go away Jay. Thank you. That was great.

125
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,205
Speaker 2:  This was great. Yep.

126
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,885
Speaker 4:  Great to be here. I'm sorry I made you feel bad.

127
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:15,085
Speaker 2:  All right, next up on The Verge productivity docket Senior Reviewer Victoria

128
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:18,885
Speaker 2:  Song V Song, welcome back. Hello. Tell me about your

129
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:19,685
Speaker 2:  productivity system.

130
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:23,325
Speaker 5:  So it used to be digital and then I remembered that

131
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:27,925
Speaker 5:  my memory is going to shit and it actually is a lot better if you

132
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:31,765
Speaker 5:  write things down. So it is now more than half analog

133
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:36,125
Speaker 5:  with one app. Okay. So, I got so sick of all the to-do

134
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:40,045
Speaker 5:  apps, like even the good ones even I was trying super list, I was, you know,

135
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:44,005
Speaker 5:  I continually miss Wonder List. Yes. And then

136
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:47,405
Speaker 5:  I, you know, I'd been using Todoist for years. No,

137
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,645
Speaker 5:  I'm forced to use the Airtable here because we have to like

138
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:56,325
Speaker 5:  collaborate and whatever. So I do use that

139
00:08:57,305 --> 00:09:01,125
Speaker 5:  not as well as I should, but I do use it. But I have like

140
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:04,925
Speaker 5:  a, I have like four journals that I, I keep all my product

141
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:08,605
Speaker 5:  productivity in. But the main one, and this one was actually recommended

142
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:12,565
Speaker 5:  to me by our, our former colleague McKenna Kelly. It is

143
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:16,485
Speaker 5:  the Papier productivity journal and it's great because

144
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:20,605
Speaker 5:  it is a actual journal where I write things

145
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:24,565
Speaker 5:  down and like the best part of the spread is that You can

146
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:28,285
Speaker 5:  see a little undated schedule thing. Like I didn't fill this day out but

147
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:32,085
Speaker 5:  an undated schedule thing of your hours, your three most important

148
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:36,085
Speaker 5:  things that you need to do in the day and then a to do list and a little

149
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:37,525
Speaker 5:  space for you to write notes.

150
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,925
Speaker 2:  So it gives you like the kind of daily template and you just fill it out

151
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:42,485
Speaker 2:  each day. That is kind of nice.

152
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:46,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah, so it's, it's really nice. And then I've used this as a, as a

153
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:50,005
Speaker 5:  giant excuse to buy pens. So many pens in

154
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:54,045
Speaker 5:  multiple different colors. This is the pentel Matt hop, it dries,

155
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:54,565
Speaker 5:  it's Matt.

156
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:58,125
Speaker 2:  So you're one of those people who is like deep into like bullet journal TikTok

157
00:09:58,355 --> 00:09:59,205
Speaker 5:  Unfortunately

158
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:02,605
Speaker 2:  And you're like studying calligraphy just to be able to write your calendar

159
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:03,565
Speaker 2:  events more beautifully.

160
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:08,125
Speaker 5:  Yes. I've actually been like hobbyist calligrapher

161
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:10,845
Speaker 5:  for like several years. I don't ever get better. Yeah,

162
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:12,965
Speaker 2:  This all tracks v, this all fully tracks.

163
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:18,485
Speaker 5:  I unfortunately don't get better but like you can't see it. But I have this

164
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:22,325
Speaker 5:  entire drawer of washy tapes. I just went to New York

165
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:25,925
Speaker 5:  City stationary Fest a couple of weeks ago to buy more

166
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:30,565
Speaker 5:  washy tape. Oh my god. And so many stickers of

167
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:34,645
Speaker 5:  cats. So this is like a whole

168
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:38,285
Speaker 5:  thing. I have this whole bag full of of of of like

169
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,245
Speaker 5:  glue and different kinds of markers and all of these things. Do I need all

170
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:44,645
Speaker 5:  of these things to write out what a bullet journal should be?

171
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,325
Speaker 5:  No, absolutely not. But the physical act of writing things

172
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:53,765
Speaker 5:  actually is quite, it helps me remember what

173
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:57,285
Speaker 5:  it is that I'm supposed to do and it helps me be very

174
00:10:57,315 --> 00:11:01,085
Speaker 5:  intentional with my day. And then what I'll do is like once I figure out

175
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,645
Speaker 5:  a game plan, it never goes according to plan. Sure. Ever. Not once

176
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:09,165
Speaker 5:  has my plan for the day ever gone according to plan. The point is, is in

177
00:11:09,165 --> 00:11:12,885
Speaker 5:  writing it. And so that if we get 75% of the way there,

178
00:11:13,895 --> 00:11:17,645
Speaker 5:  we've done a very good job. But generally what I'll do

179
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:21,725
Speaker 5:  is I'll put in like some of my like most important tasks

180
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:25,005
Speaker 5:  that I know I absolutely do not want to do into my

181
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:29,045
Speaker 5:  Pomodoro app, which is focus to do and I've written

182
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:32,445
Speaker 5:  about it for the site. It just forces you to do something

183
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:36,805
Speaker 5:  for a very digestible amount of time. So like

184
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:40,285
Speaker 5:  I, I stick to the usual 25, 5 minute breakdown with the

185
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,805
Speaker 5:  Pomodoro timer and I find if there's just like a draft, I am

186
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:48,045
Speaker 5:  absolutely like I, I don't wanna write this draft like theoretically

187
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:51,725
Speaker 5:  I wanna write it but the actual physical act of writing is giving me

188
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:55,325
Speaker 5:  palpitations. I I'll just hit hit Go and

189
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:59,485
Speaker 5:  You can do anything if it's only for 25 minutes. Totally. Like it's amazing

190
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:03,045
Speaker 5:  So I will use that. and what I like about this particular

191
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:07,365
Speaker 5:  Pomodoro Timer app is that it lets you do things as to-dos. So you

192
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:11,085
Speaker 5:  get the really nice little like, ooh, I checked it off. Mm this is a great

193
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:15,165
Speaker 5:  and if I've like really got a stacked day and I'm just like,

194
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:19,005
Speaker 5:  I mean we all feel the days where we go to work and you're like, I don't

195
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:22,805
Speaker 5:  wanna do this today. Absolutely not. Capitalism has a choke hold on my

196
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:26,605
Speaker 5:  existential dread today. This is how I like basically force myself

197
00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:30,405
Speaker 5:  to get through it. And it's nice because I look for those like five minute

198
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:33,405
Speaker 5:  breaks and I'm like, and then I'm gonna clean like

199
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,925
Speaker 5:  furiously for five minutes and then get back to it's

200
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:38,965
Speaker 2:  Also, it's amazing how much You can do in five minutes when

201
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:39,245
Speaker 5:  You're like

202
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:40,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah it's, I only have five minutes.

203
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:44,005
Speaker 5:  It's amazing. Yeah, it is amazing. Like I can't tell you I've gotten down

204
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:47,765
Speaker 5:  to like emptying the dishwasher down to like a four minute

205
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:51,645
Speaker 5:  55 second art. It's really great. So yeah, like

206
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:55,605
Speaker 5:  that's like what I do now. I used to do so many other different things

207
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:59,685
Speaker 5:  and like I do use Notion Calendar because I like that

208
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:03,165
Speaker 5:  it will block off on my personal calendar

209
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:07,365
Speaker 5:  stuff on my work calendar. Yes. And vice versa. That's honestly

210
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:11,125
Speaker 5:  the main reason why I still use it because once they changed over from

211
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:15,205
Speaker 5:  Cron to the Notion calendar thing, I got very mad at the icon

212
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:19,085
Speaker 5:  change 'cause it now disrupts the harmony, my aesthetic harmony

213
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,205
Speaker 5:  of my task bar, which is like

214
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:26,885
Speaker 5:  small potatoes. But as we've established, I am a very aesthetic

215
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:30,725
Speaker 5:  bullet driller. It takes more time to make my

216
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:31,125
Speaker 5:  spread.

217
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:35,445
Speaker 2:  I have heard by the way that you and I specifically have caused a ruckus

218
00:13:35,585 --> 00:13:39,365
Speaker 2:  inside of Notion with our loud public hate of that icon. So

219
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:43,125
Speaker 2:  we are going to continue to fight the good fight and we're gonna win someday

220
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,765
Speaker 2:  some way We will, we will win.

221
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:49,965
Speaker 5:  It's an ugly icon. It's an ugly icon. It's an, it's an ugly icon.

222
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:53,885
Speaker 5:  I am sorry. It used to be just like all my productivity

223
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:57,885
Speaker 5:  apps were red and I was so happy and now this just sticks

224
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:01,765
Speaker 5:  out. Unfortunately it's like the best one for my

225
00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:05,685
Speaker 5:  use. So like yeah I don't, I have a choice. Yeah. I'm stuck with it

226
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:06,365
Speaker 5:  for now. That's fair.

227
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:09,405
Speaker 2:  But yeah, I have two quick questions about the journal. Yes. One,

228
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:14,005
Speaker 2:  is it just the act of physically writing it that you feel like helps you

229
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:16,765
Speaker 2:  remember it enough that you don't have to like check it every 10 minutes?

230
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:19,405
Speaker 2:  Or is it still like you have it open next to you all day and you're like

231
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:20,525
Speaker 2:  constantly looking at it?

232
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:24,565
Speaker 5:  I will periodically open it just to like be like what's the game plan again?

233
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:28,205
Speaker 5:  What am my to-dos again? Okay, cool. But actually like physically writing

234
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:32,045
Speaker 5:  things down, it does help me remember things better.

235
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:35,165
Speaker 5:  And like I think there's studies showing that when you physically write stuff

236
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:38,845
Speaker 5:  you do retain the information a lot better than you would with the digital

237
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:43,245
Speaker 5:  clutter. Oh yeah. That's the main reason why I do it. It keeps me on track

238
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:47,165
Speaker 5:  of things. So bullet journaling, they have like this whole iconography of

239
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:50,725
Speaker 5:  like symbols. Oh yeah. I I I hate it. Can't, can't retain that stuff

240
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:54,925
Speaker 5:  for the life of me. The only thing I do retain is like they use like a little

241
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:59,325
Speaker 5:  sharp arrow to kind of indicate you didn't get it done.

242
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:03,325
Speaker 5:  You have to migrate it to the next day. So I do hate it but it

243
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:06,965
Speaker 5:  does kind of give me insight into the things that I really

244
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:11,525
Speaker 5:  kind of put off. That would really only take me 10 minutes to do

245
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:13,485
Speaker 5:  so I'll try. Yeah.

246
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:16,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And there's something too, the third day in a row you're writing the

247
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:19,405
Speaker 2:  same task that you've been moving where you're like, fine, I'll just do it.

248
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:22,165
Speaker 2:  Like leave me alone journal, I'll just do the thing.

249
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:26,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah it, I actually find it works a lot better that annoyance than actually

250
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:29,925
Speaker 5:  just like resetting the due date digitally 'cause you

251
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,965
Speaker 5:  just erase the due. Like there's something about like the digitalness of

252
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,685
Speaker 5:  it that really doesn't work for my brain. Which is odd 'cause

253
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:40,725
Speaker 5:  I also wrote a story for The Verge that was like all I want is one

254
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:44,565
Speaker 5:  productivity app that does everything. It's never gonna happen. But that's

255
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:48,525
Speaker 5:  all I wanted for the long time. And I actually do think that like being

256
00:15:48,555 --> 00:15:52,205
Speaker 5:  obsessive and writing out every single

257
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:56,085
Speaker 5:  workout that I've done for August helps me like

258
00:15:56,365 --> 00:16:00,245
Speaker 5:  visually like it's also insane 'cause I've done like 38 workouts so

259
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:04,205
Speaker 5:  far in August. But I don't know something about it and

260
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:08,085
Speaker 5:  just like, oh let me just write down every single book I read and my four

261
00:16:08,195 --> 00:16:11,125
Speaker 5:  like four word review of them or just,

262
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:15,645
Speaker 5:  it just helps me be intentional. It's like a five minute break at the end

263
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:19,525
Speaker 5:  of my day. It lets me not look at the

264
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:23,485
Speaker 5:  horribleness of Airtable and getting mad at how everyone else is

265
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:27,565
Speaker 5:  using it wrong compared to me. 'cause I am the only one using it

266
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:29,405
Speaker 5:  correctly. It's not true but that's just

267
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,565
Speaker 2:  How, by not using it very much I think is that, is that what you're saying?

268
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:31,965
Speaker 2:  That feels

269
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:35,645
Speaker 5:  Right. I used to use it so much and I got so frustrated with how

270
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:38,885
Speaker 5:  everyone else at The Verge uses it that I was just like, screw this. Like

271
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:40,205
Speaker 5:  I can't, I can't handle it anymore.

272
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,245
Speaker 2:  Does the journal go everywhere with you by the way? Or does it like live

273
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:46,525
Speaker 2:  on your desk? Can you come back to it at the beginning and end of the day?

274
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:50,885
Speaker 5:  It lives on my desk and I come back to it at the end of the day. Like

275
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:54,685
Speaker 5:  I do notice that on days that I go to the office, I tend to like fall off

276
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:57,805
Speaker 5:  for that one day. So if you look at my journal the Thursdays, which are the

277
00:16:57,805 --> 00:17:01,245
Speaker 5:  days I most often going to the office completely blank most of the time.

278
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:05,125
Speaker 5:  But that's okay. It's like not intended to be perfect.

279
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:09,485
Speaker 5:  That's why I use undated journals. I used to use the dated ones and

280
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:13,085
Speaker 5:  then the pressure of filling every single day would just like

281
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:17,085
Speaker 5:  make me not use it. So it's all undated, it's all loosey

282
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:20,885
Speaker 5:  goosey. Were were, it's, I stopped being too

283
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:25,045
Speaker 5:  precious and pretty with all of my spreads because then that was too much

284
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:28,485
Speaker 5:  pressure to be like, oh my God it's the 30th or the first of the month I

285
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:32,205
Speaker 5:  have to spend four hours calligraphy a

286
00:17:32,205 --> 00:17:35,925
Speaker 5:  spread with stickers and transfer papers and all that sort of stuff. So

287
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:40,165
Speaker 5:  yeah, no, no. Like now we're, I, I'm a normal person now and

288
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:43,965
Speaker 5:  I just mostly write stuff and I make things pretty for my

289
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,005
Speaker 5:  brain and that's about it. Yeah,

290
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:46,765
Speaker 2:  I love that for you.

291
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Also pens,

292
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:51,365
Speaker 2:  You're, I know more pens. I just can't get over this convention you went

293
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:54,805
Speaker 2:  to but we'll, we'll talk about that another time. Thank you as always be

294
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:58,365
Speaker 2:  no problem. Next on my productive person list is Kara

295
00:17:58,765 --> 00:18:02,545
Speaker 2:  Verney, the s managing editor unprompted. Three of the five

296
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:05,345
Speaker 2:  people were like I just don't, I don't, I don't know how I'm gonna compare

297
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:06,025
Speaker 2:  to Kara. So

298
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:10,065
Speaker 6:  What's funny is like there's a rumor that's been started about me

299
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:13,865
Speaker 6:  and I did not start this rumor that I am like this hyper

300
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:18,145
Speaker 6:  organized person and I am not actually,

301
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:22,265
Speaker 6:  I am very rudimentary in my product

302
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:25,105
Speaker 6:  productivity software that I use to keep myself organized.

303
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:28,265
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So let's just dive in. Tell me about your productivity system.

304
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:32,625
Speaker 6:  I take a lot of notes. Is basically the long and the short of it.

305
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:36,825
Speaker 6:  I take notes all the time. My tip

306
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:40,425
Speaker 6:  for myself that I learned long ago is that if I don't write it down, I don't

307
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:43,905
Speaker 6:  know it. So if I'm in a meeting I take notes. I went to the doctor last week,

308
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:47,785
Speaker 6:  she was saying a bunch of stuff. I wasn't gonna remember that So I took notes.

309
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:52,385
Speaker 6:  I usually default reach for just the notes app on my

310
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:56,185
Speaker 6:  phone 'cause I don't need a bunch of AI

311
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:59,985
Speaker 6:  summaries and prompts and ways to streamline and all of that stuff.

312
00:19:00,745 --> 00:19:04,345
Speaker 6:  'cause I actually think all of that is distracting. Distracting and makes

313
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:08,185
Speaker 6:  you less productive. So I like the stuff that's pretty basic.

314
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:12,625
Speaker 2:  So is your notes app like just an

315
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:17,065
Speaker 2:  unbelievably long series of individual notes or do you have like

316
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:18,385
Speaker 2:  a, do you have a notes system?

317
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:22,945
Speaker 6:  It's an unbelievably long series of individual notes. Okay. but they

318
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:26,705
Speaker 6:  do all have titles so that I can find them very quickly because

319
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:31,185
Speaker 6:  it often comes up where someone's like, oh what did I say? Or, and

320
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:35,025
Speaker 6:  I'm like, I'm a Scorpio, I need receipts. Like So I always am able to

321
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:38,945
Speaker 6:  find what I'm searching for, which is very handy. But

322
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:42,745
Speaker 6:  yeah, I don't, I don't interact with technology perhaps

323
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:46,265
Speaker 6:  as much as some folks think I do a lot of handwritten

324
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:46,945
Speaker 6:  post-Its

325
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,225
Speaker 2:  Do you have a to-do list?

326
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:50,585
Speaker 6:  I do have a to-do list. Yes.

327
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:51,745
Speaker 2:  Okay. Tell me about it.

328
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:55,945
Speaker 6:  It moves, it shifts based on where I am. I

329
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,585
Speaker 6:  sit in multiple places during the day so that I can be closest to the sun.

330
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:01,545
Speaker 6:  And so if I'm cat

331
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:02,305
Speaker 2:  Basically Okay.

332
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:06,665
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I'm, I'm a plant, I just angle. So if I'm at my desk,

333
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:10,745
Speaker 6:  my to do list is like a big wall calendar that I keep. I

334
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:13,545
Speaker 6:  obviously keep things on my phone. My phone and my work computer do not talk

335
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,385
Speaker 6:  to each other 'cause I think that that's important. So I

336
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:20,905
Speaker 6:  often have two things. I have like work Cara and then I have life Cara.

337
00:20:21,495 --> 00:20:24,665
Speaker 6:  Okay. And they don't interact with each other. But my Google Calendar interacts

338
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:28,025
Speaker 2:  But that's the only that, that's the only system that's allowed to overlap.

339
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:28,465
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

340
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:33,505
Speaker 6:  I try not to keep, like if I, I was outta town the past two days and I

341
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,865
Speaker 6:  took Slack off my phone. So I try to be very

342
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,265
Speaker 6:  separate when I can be.

343
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:43,705
Speaker 2:  Is that a like life work balance thing or why

344
00:20:43,735 --> 00:20:44,745
Speaker 2:  keep them so far apart?

345
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:48,285
Speaker 6:  I just think it's like, it's kind of a scam.

346
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:52,565
Speaker 6:  Productivity is kind of a scam because you feel like the more time that

347
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:56,045
Speaker 6:  you spend plugged into the thing is like making you better. But actually

348
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:58,605
Speaker 6:  it's just wasting your time from doing the thing that needs to get done.

349
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:02,205
Speaker 6:  And this is not to say that I don't procrastinate because I do, I mean until

350
00:21:02,205 --> 00:21:06,045
Speaker 6:  the last minute to do literally everything. But there's something about

351
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:10,005
Speaker 6:  like having to plug it into a thing so that I can cross it. Like

352
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:11,925
Speaker 6:  that just doesn't make sense to me. So I'll often just,

353
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:16,045
Speaker 2:  Ah, so the idea of like it feels good to check something off of your,

354
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:17,285
Speaker 2:  to-do list does nothing for you.

355
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:21,725
Speaker 6:  It like does sometimes if I'm like starting at like the top of a day and

356
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:24,565
Speaker 6:  I know that I'll get something done in five minutes, sometimes I get that

357
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:27,925
Speaker 6:  little like buzz. But oftentimes I'm like I'm just gonna get the thing done.

358
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:32,765
Speaker 6:  So I don't really like do a ton of task tracking through my

359
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:36,485
Speaker 6:  various moments of every day. It's kind of just like taking

360
00:21:36,485 --> 00:21:39,165
Speaker 6:  notes and just remembering what was said and what I need to get done from

361
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:39,285
Speaker 6:  that.

362
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:43,845
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. Do you spend a lot of time like going back and reviewing your

363
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:44,805
Speaker 2:  notes? Yes. Afterwards.

364
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:49,005
Speaker 6:  Okay. I pour over them constantly. Okay. 'cause that from my notes is

365
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:52,325
Speaker 6:  what I know my next steps are. If I need to add something to my calendar,

366
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:55,005
Speaker 6:  if I need to follow up with someone, if I need to schedule a meeting, like

367
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:58,165
Speaker 6:  everything comes out of my notes. So it's kind of like a brain dump and then

368
00:21:58,965 --> 00:21:59,925
Speaker 6:  I take from that.

369
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:03,805
Speaker 2:  Okay. I think that is actually less chaotic

370
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:08,085
Speaker 2:  than you're making it sound like. What, what's interesting though is

371
00:22:08,205 --> 00:22:10,845
Speaker 2:  I think the, the thing I hear from a lot of like, you know, quote unquote

372
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:13,605
Speaker 2:  productivity experts is like the first step is like write everything down.

373
00:22:13,605 --> 00:22:16,205
Speaker 2:  Right? I think you're actually like way ahead of the game on that one. And

374
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:19,805
Speaker 2:  then step two is like take all the stuff

375
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:23,485
Speaker 2:  that's in there and make like a beautiful task

376
00:22:23,505 --> 00:22:26,965
Speaker 2:  system out of it. And then step free is just get everything done and you

377
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:29,965
Speaker 2:  just skip step two. Which I find fascinating. You just go through the notes

378
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:32,845
Speaker 2:  and you're like, okay here's the stuff. I'm just gonna go do the stuff. Instead

379
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:36,125
Speaker 2:  of like plugging it all into some incredibly organized

380
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:38,685
Speaker 2:  middleware to do list system.

381
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:41,885
Speaker 6:  Correct. Because that's the stuff that I think is sucking your brain outta

382
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:45,805
Speaker 6:  your body is just like making things color coded and beautiful. 'cause like

383
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:50,365
Speaker 6:  who, unless you're sharing it with someone that like really needs to know

384
00:22:50,365 --> 00:22:54,325
Speaker 6:  exactly what you're doing every minute of the day. But I operate very independently

385
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:58,325
Speaker 6:  in my work life and my personal life. And So I don't have like a ton of people

386
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:01,605
Speaker 6:  that need to know every detail of how I'm spending my, my moments.

387
00:23:02,395 --> 00:23:05,965
Speaker 2:  Okay. Are you, I know for sure that you're a like

388
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:09,805
Speaker 2:  calendar person at work because you have to be. Yeah. Are you a calendar

389
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,205
Speaker 2:  person? Not at work. A hundred

390
00:23:11,205 --> 00:23:11,965
Speaker 6:  Percent. Yeah.

391
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:15,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Are you like sending friends calendar invites when you're hanging out

392
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:15,845
Speaker 2:  on Saturday?

393
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:19,645
Speaker 6:  So I only do that with people that know me really well. I don't like if I

394
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:22,845
Speaker 6:  make a new friend, I'm not like, we're gonna get drinks on Saturday. Like

395
00:23:22,845 --> 00:23:26,165
Speaker 6:  I don't do that 'cause that would be like next level. But if people know

396
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:29,885
Speaker 6:  me really well, I also have a, a dear friend of mine who does that with me.

397
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:33,085
Speaker 6:  Like, we're going to a wedding at the end of September and she already sent

398
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:36,805
Speaker 6:  me the calendar invite for like what we need to be where, which I appreciate,

399
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:37,125
Speaker 6:  I like

400
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,165
Speaker 2:  It. There's something honestly like truly wonderful about that. Yeah. Like

401
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:43,565
Speaker 2:  my, my immediate reaction is to be horrified by that. But the longer I think

402
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:47,085
Speaker 2:  about it, I'm like, I love this. Yeah. Like this is great. It's, we are doing

403
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:48,805
Speaker 2:  this together. Put it on my calendar's.

404
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:51,965
Speaker 6:  Go. I think yeah, it's flattering when someone takes the time to like think

405
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:54,925
Speaker 6:  of you and they're like, hey, they would probably appreciate like knowing

406
00:23:54,925 --> 00:23:58,525
Speaker 6:  that I'm telling them where to be, but I'm bossing them around. That's

407
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:02,445
Speaker 6:  flattering. I think there's like a, there's like an element too of if

408
00:24:02,445 --> 00:24:05,805
Speaker 6:  I don't, again, if I don't write it down I won't remember it. But if I write

409
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:09,205
Speaker 6:  something down, it's in my head. So there'll be some like vague

410
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:13,165
Speaker 6:  recollection that someone quoted me, you know, something to come fix my car.

411
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:17,125
Speaker 6:  And it's like, actually I know that you said it was $737 because I know I

412
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:20,925
Speaker 6:  wrote that down. So like it's kind of like a weird photographic thing that

413
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:24,845
Speaker 6:  happens to me. So even if I have like a workout class or like

414
00:24:24,845 --> 00:24:27,325
Speaker 6:  something like that, I put it on my calendar 'cause then I won't forget that

415
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:29,325
Speaker 6:  that's what's happening that night. So, okay,

416
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:32,645
Speaker 2:  That makes sense. This works for me. So the the remembering it because you

417
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:34,685
Speaker 2:  wrote it down thing is really interesting 'cause I've talked to a couple

418
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:38,645
Speaker 2:  of people on our staff for this episode who have said the reason they switched

419
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:42,405
Speaker 2:  to like analog notebooks is because

420
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:46,565
Speaker 2:  the act of writing long hand helped them remember. Yeah. And it's

421
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:49,205
Speaker 2:  true, right? Like there's tons of science that says if you hand write, you

422
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:53,325
Speaker 2:  remember better than if you type. Have you and I half expected you

423
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,685
Speaker 2:  to be a person who like lifted up your giant trapper keeper of a notebook

424
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:59,685
Speaker 2:  and you're like, look at this organizational system. Have you ever been that

425
00:24:59,685 --> 00:25:00,085
Speaker 2:  kind of person?

426
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,525
Speaker 6:  A hundred percent yes. Okay. I have, like I said, it just depends on where

427
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:07,365
Speaker 6:  I'm seated, what kind of thing I use to keep track of things. So if I'm at

428
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:10,845
Speaker 6:  my desk, which I'm not right now I have like folders and

429
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:14,405
Speaker 6:  post-its and calendars and a thing of my, like that's how I kind of organize

430
00:25:14,405 --> 00:25:18,285
Speaker 6:  myself. But when I'm not, I'm kind of left to

431
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:22,485
Speaker 6:  more minimalist devices. So, I think it just kind of depends on

432
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:26,125
Speaker 6:  where, but for me, I think maybe this is what you're asking. It doesn't matter

433
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:30,085
Speaker 6:  if I'm typing it or if I'm writing it like same result as long as it's going

434
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:33,085
Speaker 6:  somewhere. Interesting. Okay. I think this was also just like a, our age

435
00:25:33,085 --> 00:25:36,765
Speaker 6:  group thing was told like maybe in college that like writing things down

436
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:40,445
Speaker 6:  is how you remember. Like I just think like that's just, people

437
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:44,645
Speaker 6:  think that way. And maybe it's true. I don't know. It is for me,

438
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:48,085
Speaker 2:  I think the thing that I've found that works is I do it much more slowly.

439
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:51,845
Speaker 2:  Like I type really fast and I don't write by hand that fast. So there is

440
00:25:51,845 --> 00:25:55,645
Speaker 2:  something to the, like you have to, I think the, the,

441
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:59,005
Speaker 2:  I had a professor once who described it as like, You can transcribe when

442
00:25:59,005 --> 00:26:02,445
Speaker 2:  you're typing, but because you can't write as fast as someone can talk, you

443
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:04,925
Speaker 2:  have to kind of synthesize as you go. Right. And it's actually making your

444
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:07,965
Speaker 2:  brain work. And that's really useful. Yeah. And I totally get that. I also

445
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:10,885
Speaker 2:  just hate writing by hand. I just, I just, I'm done writing by hand. It's

446
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:13,325
Speaker 2:  2024. Handwriting is over. I don't,

447
00:26:13,445 --> 00:26:16,405
Speaker 6:  Do you have good penmanship? No. So that's probably why,

448
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:19,405
Speaker 2:  That's my real problem because people complain. I I, my wife makes fun of

449
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:23,325
Speaker 2:  me because I have like, like literally there will be like a a, you

450
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:26,965
Speaker 2:  know, postcard written by a kindergartner on someone's fridge and Anna will

451
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:29,285
Speaker 2:  point at it and be like, that looks like your handwriting. Yeah. And she's

452
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:30,565
Speaker 2:  right. That's nice. It's terrible.

453
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:34,565
Speaker 6:  That's nice. Yeah. I feel very proud of my penmanship. So that's

454
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:37,765
Speaker 6:  probably part of it is like that helps, you know, when you're like in a group

455
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:40,445
Speaker 6:  setting and someone's like, who has good handwriting? I'm always like, gimme

456
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:40,845
Speaker 6:  an

457
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:44,965
Speaker 2:  Ah, yeah, I, I run from those rooms. Like that is not

458
00:26:45,175 --> 00:26:48,005
Speaker 2:  under no circumstances should I be allowed to write on the whiteboard for

459
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:48,205
Speaker 2:  everybody.

460
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:51,965
Speaker 6:  But I do think there's something to that. There's like a slightly performative

461
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:55,565
Speaker 6:  nature if you're doing something with someone else and you're handwriting

462
00:26:55,565 --> 00:26:58,365
Speaker 6:  it 'cause you're like, they have to be able to understand what I'm saying

463
00:26:58,365 --> 00:27:01,845
Speaker 6:  here versus for sure typing it. You're like they'll get it. They don't have

464
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:04,925
Speaker 6:  to worry about that element. So Totally. You know, part of it is just like,

465
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:08,645
Speaker 6:  is this for me to remember that I need to like go pick up my dog from doggy

466
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:11,765
Speaker 6:  daycare or is this for like somebody else to know what I'm doing? You know,

467
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:15,445
Speaker 2:  It is amazing how far write everything down

468
00:27:15,795 --> 00:27:19,125
Speaker 2:  gets you like that. That is one of the big takeaways I've gotten from talking

469
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:22,205
Speaker 2:  to people about this. Like kind of at all levels of it that like if you just

470
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:25,885
Speaker 2:  write everything down, most other things kind of start to solve

471
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:26,245
Speaker 2:  themselves.

472
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:30,365
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna be really interested to see if there's any

473
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:34,565
Speaker 6:  communication increase after this podcast because I'm curious to see how

474
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:36,925
Speaker 6:  many people say they write everything down and then I'm gonna be like, Bob,

475
00:27:37,895 --> 00:27:40,005
Speaker 6:  where? What's the deadline? You know? Yeah. We'll

476
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:43,525
Speaker 2:  See a bunch of liars. It turns out. All right. Thank you Kara.

477
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:44,405
Speaker 6:  No problem.

478
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:48,405
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna keep going. I'm having

479
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:51,965
Speaker 2:  so much fun with this. I'm already learning so much. We got more to do. We'll

480
00:27:51,965 --> 00:27:52,325
Speaker 2:  be right back.

481
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:03,395
Speaker 2:  So are you like a, you have one doc called like my to do list that everything

482
00:29:03,395 --> 00:29:06,035
Speaker 2:  lives in? Or are you like every time you get a new thing to do, you make

483
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,515
Speaker 2:  a new beautiful Google Doc and start from there?

484
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:11,555
Speaker 7:  I I, there it's both right. So, I have my to do list in life and at work

485
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:15,475
Speaker 7:  that I just run, like run through and add things and take things away from.

486
00:29:15,975 --> 00:29:19,195
Speaker 7:  And then I project base have lists that,

487
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:23,075
Speaker 7:  you know, a lot of the memos that I write or project trackers that I put

488
00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:27,075
Speaker 7:  together are just glorified Google docs with checklists that I just,

489
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:31,515
Speaker 7:  you know, assign different people to different things like, but it's just,

490
00:29:31,615 --> 00:29:35,515
Speaker 7:  it gets checked as it gets done. So that's like my number one way in

491
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:39,395
Speaker 7:  which I organize my life and my work and get everything done.

492
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:43,885
Speaker 2:  Why Google Docs? So, I love Google Docs, but I loathe using

493
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:47,325
Speaker 2:  Google Docs on my phone, which is the reason I don't do what you're describing.

494
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:49,125
Speaker 2:  So I'm curious why Google Docs?

495
00:29:49,525 --> 00:29:53,165
Speaker 7:  I love Google Docs because it's the closest thing to a piece of paper and

496
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:57,165
Speaker 7:  so that's why I use it again, old, old school here. I don't really use my

497
00:29:57,165 --> 00:30:00,245
Speaker 7:  phone for productivity. I guess that's a good thing to mention here. I feel

498
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:04,005
Speaker 7:  like when I'm in getting things done mode, it's gonna be me and my computer

499
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:08,045
Speaker 7:  typing away and looking at things and having my 87 tabs open.

500
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:12,005
Speaker 7:  My phone is more for fun and to hear from my kids and my husbands.

501
00:30:12,595 --> 00:30:16,525
Speaker 7:  Besides for that like So I, guess that that doesn't really answer your question

502
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:19,525
Speaker 7:  about how it's bad on the phone 'cause I don't use it on my phone.

503
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:22,525
Speaker 2:  Right. That's a totally fair answer. Yeah, I'm the opposite where like for

504
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:26,445
Speaker 2:  me I am constantly like the only reason I ever remember to do

505
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:29,445
Speaker 2:  anything is because I write stuff down on my phone all the time and if I

506
00:30:29,445 --> 00:30:32,005
Speaker 2:  had to wait until I was back at my computer, I would forget everything. And

507
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:34,085
Speaker 2:  so Google Docs becomes a total non-starter for me. Oh

508
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:37,925
Speaker 7:  Wow. I do that also, but here's what I do. I

509
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:42,725
Speaker 7:  text myself remind, like things that I wanna remember. So that is my

510
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:46,765
Speaker 7:  own chaotic personal system is I will text myself whether it's like a

511
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:49,285
Speaker 7:  link to something that I wanna buy, whether it's a reminder to do something

512
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:52,885
Speaker 7:  like anything. And then that gets transferred to my to-do list when I'm sitting

513
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:56,125
Speaker 7:  in front of my computer. So if I'm sitting down to write a grocery list,

514
00:30:56,135 --> 00:31:00,125
Speaker 7:  let's say I can't do that on my phone. That has to be on my, and like I

515
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,805
Speaker 7:  said Google Docs is for my work life, for my personal life, I use the notes

516
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:06,245
Speaker 7:  app on the Apple, apple Notes solely, but

517
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:10,445
Speaker 7:  that's, it has a really, really good check feature. So,

518
00:31:11,065 --> 00:31:14,405
Speaker 7:  but again, if I'm trying to get things done, whether it's like to plan a

519
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:17,965
Speaker 7:  menu or figure out school supplies for the kids or whatever,

520
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:21,965
Speaker 7:  I'm sitting down and typing on my computer, I'm not doing that on my phone.

521
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:23,405
Speaker 2:  Does it help like

522
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:27,395
Speaker 2:  organize your life a little bit? Where like when I'm sitting on my computer

523
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:30,675
Speaker 2:  I can, I can do you know like capital P productive things. Yeah. And then

524
00:31:30,675 --> 00:31:32,795
Speaker 2:  I close the computer and I don't have to do those things anymore.

525
00:31:32,795 --> 00:31:36,635
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think it's helpful because I just, I feel like when I'm

526
00:31:36,635 --> 00:31:40,355
Speaker 7:  on the computer I'm fo it's more, I'm more focused. Whereas

527
00:31:40,495 --> 00:31:43,555
Speaker 7:  my phone is like the opposite of focus for me it's just like jumping from

528
00:31:43,555 --> 00:31:47,435
Speaker 7:  like social media apps to streaming apps to the news to notifications

529
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:50,555
Speaker 7:  to So-and-so's calling me and texts and WhatsApp,

530
00:31:51,615 --> 00:31:55,435
Speaker 7:  So I just like being from my computer. Sometimes I mute text if I need to

531
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:59,355
Speaker 7:  focus really more and that's like my work time, that's

532
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:03,155
Speaker 7:  my getting things done time. And I think also like, again, this is, I'm showing

533
00:32:03,175 --> 00:32:06,715
Speaker 7:  my age, but like bigger screen, easier to just like

534
00:32:06,865 --> 00:32:10,315
Speaker 7:  picture the thing you need to picture, look at the full thing you need to

535
00:32:10,315 --> 00:32:14,115
Speaker 7:  do. I'm much more comfortable browsing the internet on my laptop

536
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:17,635
Speaker 7:  browser than I am on my phone. Like I feel like it's, the phone is too small

537
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:21,595
Speaker 7:  and too confined and so if I need to look something up or

538
00:32:22,355 --> 00:32:24,555
Speaker 7:  anything like that, I just, I'm much more comfortable on the computer than

539
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:25,595
Speaker 7:  I am on my phone. So.

540
00:32:26,685 --> 00:32:30,175
Speaker 2:  Okay. What about calendar? I like you're, you're a person who has a lot of

541
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:32,935
Speaker 2:  meetings at work, So, I assume your calendar is very important, but are you

542
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:36,255
Speaker 2:  like a, are you a calendar person in general? Like are you the one who's

543
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:40,325
Speaker 2:  throwing like take out the trash in your calendar with a reminder

544
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,525
Speaker 2:  every week kind of vibes?

545
00:32:41,825 --> 00:32:45,765
Speaker 7:  So if it's a spectrum, I'm definitely not all the way on that side, but

546
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:48,485
Speaker 7:  I'm also not on the like ignore the calendar side.

547
00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:53,565
Speaker 7:  I would say I am really into calendar.

548
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:57,685
Speaker 7:  I rely on my Google Calendar so much, but

549
00:32:58,345 --> 00:33:00,765
Speaker 7:  I'm not at the point where like I wanna have a shared gal with my husband.

550
00:33:00,765 --> 00:33:03,725
Speaker 7:  Like we're not like, that's not like, I'm not like, and I know a lot of people

551
00:33:03,745 --> 00:33:06,885
Speaker 7:  do that and they love it. Like I don't need to do that. Like, no thanks.

552
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:09,485
Speaker 2:  Are you the holdup there or is your husband the holdup there?

553
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:13,405
Speaker 7:  I think we are both very happy not to, not to be okay not to be that efficient

554
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:16,685
Speaker 7:  as a family together. You know, like that's too much pressure.

555
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:20,625
Speaker 2:  So when you have a thing that you all have to do together, how do you

556
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:22,345
Speaker 2:  who, how, how does it happen?

557
00:33:22,745 --> 00:33:25,905
Speaker 7:  I put it in my calendar. He puts it in his calendar. We remind each other,

558
00:33:26,765 --> 00:33:27,585
Speaker 7:  we just remember

559
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:30,065
Speaker 2:  Would you send him a calendar invite? No,

560
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:30,905
Speaker 7:  No, no, no,

561
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:32,265
Speaker 2:  No. Okay. That's too much too. No,

562
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:35,345
Speaker 7:  Yeah, that's too much. I, I would not take it While if he did that to me,

563
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:39,105
Speaker 7:  I feel like that's very aggressive. Thank you very much.

564
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:42,665
Speaker 2:  He's like, date night sends you an invite to your work email.

565
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:46,825
Speaker 7:  No, no, no thanks. But, but I would say at work especially I

566
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:50,745
Speaker 7:  do like to be really strict with my calendar and

567
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:54,225
Speaker 7:  more because I think it's like it gives you permission to focus on that task

568
00:33:54,295 --> 00:33:57,785
Speaker 7:  when you, when you're doing it. So like I try to even

569
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,745
Speaker 7:  sometimes if my meetings get canceled I won't take them off my calendar 'cause

570
00:34:00,745 --> 00:34:04,665
Speaker 7:  I'll wanna spend that 30 minutes or that hour working on the things I would've

571
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:08,185
Speaker 7:  done in that meeting anyways. So like I'm really good at getting things on

572
00:34:08,185 --> 00:34:11,905
Speaker 7:  the calendar, not super uptight about like canceling things

573
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:15,345
Speaker 7:  in advance or whatever. Like it's more about just setting those times up

574
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,225
Speaker 7:  as I'm setting up my week and setting up my month or whatever it is.

575
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:21,545
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. That makes sense. So anything else that, when you think about

576
00:34:21,545 --> 00:34:25,305
Speaker 2:  the, like how Esther lives her life system, does

577
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:26,665
Speaker 2:  anything else belong in that system? Yes.

578
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:30,585
Speaker 7:  I would say, let me think how to phrase this. I would say

579
00:34:31,055 --> 00:34:34,625
Speaker 7:  there's a step before making a to-do list I think sometimes,

580
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:38,865
Speaker 7:  which is like what are the things I care about when I'm, when I'm

581
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:42,025
Speaker 7:  embarking on this project, right? So, I do a lot of like, you could call

582
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:44,905
Speaker 7:  it journaling, you call it brain brainstorming or just kind of like vibing.

583
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:49,065
Speaker 7:  But I like to have a written down vibe session with myself

584
00:34:49,325 --> 00:34:53,265
Speaker 7:  of just like what are the things that I need to, that are, what are

585
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:55,705
Speaker 7:  like the pillars of this project or what are the things I need to solve for

586
00:34:55,705 --> 00:34:59,625
Speaker 7:  when I'm doing this project before I sit down and then break down the

587
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:03,385
Speaker 7:  actual to do list. It's really helpful because that kind of defines the buckets

588
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:07,265
Speaker 7:  of work as you're gonna start doing them. and it also serves as like your

589
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:10,105
Speaker 7:  guide to like making sure you're always staying on track and hitting those

590
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:14,385
Speaker 7:  original goals. The other thing which is much that was like the

591
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:18,265
Speaker 7:  macro answer, this is the micro answer, is I like to, especially

592
00:35:18,265 --> 00:35:21,705
Speaker 7:  when I'm doing, you know, I work in a lot of group projects and I work with

593
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:24,785
Speaker 7:  a lot of different departments. A lot of the time I

594
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:28,865
Speaker 7:  assign stakeholders to everything. Like even if it's like,

595
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:34,145
Speaker 7:  you know, blink your eyes, like I will literally put a, put a assign a stakeholder

596
00:35:34,145 --> 00:35:37,645
Speaker 7:  because I think it's really important to just always have the person who's

597
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:41,565
Speaker 7:  accountable to do the thing written down in everything you do. Otherwise

598
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:43,885
Speaker 7:  that's when things don't get done. If people are like, oh I thought you were

599
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:46,725
Speaker 7:  doing it. No I thought you were doing it. And sometimes that's funny, right?

600
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:50,045
Speaker 7:  Like I'll be in meetings with like VPs or executives and I'll be like, okay,

601
00:35:50,045 --> 00:35:52,805
Speaker 7:  so just pause everyone. Like so who's gonna do the thing you all said we

602
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:56,685
Speaker 7:  should be doing? And it's awkward and funny but I find that it helps me

603
00:35:56,705 --> 00:36:00,125
Speaker 7:  get things done when I know like who is in charge of doing everything.

604
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:04,325
Speaker 2:  I love that. All right Esther, this is, you came in saying I have

605
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:08,285
Speaker 2:  no system. This is actually like a surprisingly thoughtful system. I'm kind

606
00:36:08,285 --> 00:36:09,285
Speaker 2:  of impressed. Is it,

607
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:11,205
Speaker 7:  Is it though? We'll see,

608
00:36:11,485 --> 00:36:14,125
Speaker 2:  I listen, I, I would get you out of Google Docs but otherwise I feel like

609
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:14,845
Speaker 2:  you're doing fairly well.

610
00:36:15,245 --> 00:36:18,885
Speaker 7:  I think my, my church and state with phone in my computer is a good thing.

611
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:21,645
Speaker 7:  So. I. I can stay in Google Docs for now. I

612
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:24,125
Speaker 2:  Agree with that. Yes. Awesome Esther, thank you. Thanks

613
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:24,805
Speaker 7:  For having me.

614
00:36:25,945 --> 00:36:29,885
Speaker 2:  I'm starting to sense a theme here with a lot of these, but I'll come back

615
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:33,485
Speaker 2:  to that. Let's keep going up next. Senior producer Victoria,

616
00:36:33,595 --> 00:36:37,045
Speaker 2:  Barrios Victoria. Describe to me your productivity system.

617
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:41,365
Speaker 8:  So for my own life I have a like three

618
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:45,285
Speaker 8:  block system. Basically So, I have a wide like

619
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:49,325
Speaker 8:  Eagle eye view. I have like a weekly view and then I have

620
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:53,125
Speaker 8:  like thoughts and notes and the way those are broken up is

621
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:57,045
Speaker 8:  above me. If you're ever in a meeting with me, I might be looking up 'cause

622
00:36:57,045 --> 00:37:00,765
Speaker 8:  I have a three month calendar breakdown full of sticky notes

623
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:04,045
Speaker 8:  of like main events for my personal life or work life.

624
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:08,125
Speaker 8:  And that's the best way for me to like see both work and personal.

625
00:37:08,585 --> 00:37:08,925
Speaker 8:  And then I

626
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:10,565
Speaker 2:  Have like a big paper calendar with sticky

627
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:13,885
Speaker 8:  Notes. So full sticky notes, easy to reference. And then

628
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:18,365
Speaker 8:  for like my everyday, like weekly tasks, I have a Google sheet

629
00:37:18,955 --> 00:37:22,765
Speaker 8:  that is broken up by the different team functions. So because of

630
00:37:22,785 --> 00:37:26,365
Speaker 8:  my role, I am like integrating in a lot of different aspects of

631
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:29,685
Speaker 8:  production but also like editorial management, special projects,

632
00:37:30,345 --> 00:37:34,325
Speaker 8:  So, I, have it like literally broken down Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

633
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:38,765
Speaker 8:  And then sponsorships, operations production.

634
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:43,365
Speaker 8:  And then I spend about 20 minutes a day before my day

635
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:46,405
Speaker 8:  begins filling out my tasks. And usually So

636
00:37:46,405 --> 00:37:49,405
Speaker 2:  You're just like, these are the buckets of my job and then you kind of fill

637
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:50,725
Speaker 2:  out each bucket each day?

638
00:37:50,795 --> 00:37:53,965
Speaker 8:  Exactly. Okay. And then I have this like loose

639
00:37:54,845 --> 00:37:58,525
Speaker 8:  notebook at me next to me at all times. Taking notes

640
00:37:58,525 --> 00:38:01,845
Speaker 8:  during meetings, whether they're like the actual direct tasks or

641
00:38:02,165 --> 00:38:05,885
Speaker 8:  thoughts that I have while someone else is speaking, especially depending

642
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:09,245
Speaker 8:  on what kind of meeting it is. Like I just had an operations meeting with

643
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:13,205
Speaker 8:  Kara and Sarah who are also two of the most organized people at The. Verge.

644
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:16,885
Speaker 8:  Yep. And for that one, it's like I usually have tasks

645
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:20,685
Speaker 8:  to do. Like I go in with the list of things I wanna discuss written in this

646
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:24,485
Speaker 8:  notebook. And then I have the tasks that I go away from. I take

647
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:27,485
Speaker 8:  everything written in this and then I'll put it onto that weekly calendar

648
00:38:27,825 --> 00:38:31,085
Speaker 8:  and then I'll make sure that weekly calendar is working back from the big

649
00:38:31,135 --> 00:38:34,925
Speaker 8:  three month calendars. I feel crazy like I'm describing this to you

650
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:35,965
Speaker 8:  look crazy.

651
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:41,245
Speaker 2:  No, I actually, I think you've actually described like a surprisingly

652
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:45,365
Speaker 2:  like catchall system that kind of collects everything. But what I'm, what

653
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:49,205
Speaker 2:  is tripping me up is, is the mix of digital and analog because

654
00:38:49,205 --> 00:38:53,045
Speaker 2:  you're like, you're taking all your notes physically, but

655
00:38:53,045 --> 00:38:56,685
Speaker 2:  then you like live inside of a spreadsheet. But then mo your most

656
00:38:56,685 --> 00:39:00,445
Speaker 2:  important stuff is on a physical like wall calendar. So

657
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:03,685
Speaker 2:  particularly with the like sitting there at your computer during a meeting

658
00:39:03,685 --> 00:39:07,525
Speaker 2:  taking notes, why do that on paper instead of like

659
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,925
Speaker 2:  in a Google Doc or whatever notes app you feel like using?

660
00:39:10,755 --> 00:39:13,675
Speaker 8:  I feel like that's more of like a, a social

661
00:39:14,795 --> 00:39:17,435
Speaker 8:  courtesy. So I don't, oh interesting. Okay. So I don't wanna look at another

662
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:21,155
Speaker 8:  screen while I'm speaking to someone, taking notes. I also

663
00:39:21,245 --> 00:39:25,195
Speaker 8:  don't want to like break my 'cause like visually,

664
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:28,435
Speaker 8:  unless I have a huge monitor, which I don't, so maybe this will change in

665
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:32,235
Speaker 8:  the future, but if I wanna be looking at the computer and looking

666
00:39:32,235 --> 00:39:35,955
Speaker 8:  at the person, I'd have to like split my windows to then be taking notes.

667
00:39:36,295 --> 00:39:39,275
Speaker 8:  See it really comes down to like one like social

668
00:39:40,155 --> 00:39:44,115
Speaker 8:  courtesy and another being like the amount of space I have on my windows

669
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:48,115
Speaker 8:  and how cluttered I want that to feel. So the Excel,

670
00:39:48,145 --> 00:39:51,675
Speaker 8:  like weekly stuff, I'm not looking at that constantly. I'm not referencing

671
00:39:51,675 --> 00:39:55,555
Speaker 8:  that constantly unless I finish a task. So, I have a task you break around

672
00:39:55,775 --> 00:39:58,915
Speaker 8:  for like an hour, 20 minutes, whatever it is, X amount of time

673
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:03,195
Speaker 8:  throughout the day. I don't need it. And I don't want a window that I constantly

674
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:07,195
Speaker 8:  need. I've tried like the Google for like Google Notes or Google

675
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,955
Speaker 8:  Keep or Google Check. Yeah, I tried that

676
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:15,155
Speaker 8:  and I found that I kept having to go to like a certain tab to keep that open.

677
00:40:15,465 --> 00:40:19,395
Speaker 8:  It's not like flush across all screens and all tabs and

678
00:40:19,395 --> 00:40:22,995
Speaker 8:  all programs. So the two paper things

679
00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:26,955
Speaker 8:  helped me keep that, like keeping it flush across it no

680
00:40:26,955 --> 00:40:30,875
Speaker 8:  matter what I'm working into or what program I'm looking into. And I reference

681
00:40:31,035 --> 00:40:34,075
Speaker 8:  'em constantly. Like I'm constantly looking at these calendars because I'm

682
00:40:34,075 --> 00:40:37,275
Speaker 8:  constantly talking about when things should be published and who's doing

683
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:38,075
Speaker 8:  what and where.

684
00:40:39,095 --> 00:40:41,555
Speaker 2:  I'm realizing now that I've never really thought about this, but just having

685
00:40:41,665 --> 00:40:45,515
Speaker 2:  like an at a glance thing that is just like, here are the one or two

686
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:49,435
Speaker 2:  most important things on days is so

687
00:40:49,435 --> 00:40:52,675
Speaker 2:  helpful. Like this happens to me all the time where it's just like, oh, somebody

688
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:55,955
Speaker 2:  is like, can we do this thing two weeks from Thursday?

689
00:40:56,575 --> 00:41:00,035
Speaker 2:  And being able to just look up and be like, oh, what's two weeks from Thursday?

690
00:41:00,035 --> 00:41:03,595
Speaker 2:  And just have like the one or two main things from that day seems so

691
00:41:03,615 --> 00:41:06,755
Speaker 2:  useful. I think I'm gonna end up stealing that idea from you. It's

692
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:10,515
Speaker 8:  Very good. Yeah, please do. It's probably my proudest like moment of

693
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:13,955
Speaker 8:  realization working at my guess for four years.

694
00:41:14,735 --> 00:41:17,155
Speaker 2:  So why a spreadsheet, by the way, for all the weekly stuff? Is that because

695
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:19,915
Speaker 2:  you're like working with other people and sharing that stuff? Or you're just

696
00:41:19,915 --> 00:41:23,835
Speaker 2:  like a spreadsheet person? I know from experience you are a bit of a spreadsheet

697
00:41:23,835 --> 00:41:26,635
Speaker 2:  person, but I'm curious why it works for you.

698
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:29,995
Speaker 8:  I am a a thousand percent proud spreadsheet girl.

699
00:41:30,975 --> 00:41:34,605
Speaker 8:  And I, I think it's, it's super versatile. So

700
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:39,245
Speaker 8:  I keep my spreadsheet super easy and I think it's a matter of

701
00:41:39,395 --> 00:41:42,845
Speaker 8:  it's adaptable. So something like Airtable, which I love also,

702
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:47,365
Speaker 8:  it's two, I think sharing focused and like

703
00:41:47,545 --> 00:41:51,125
Speaker 8:  you need to follow the rules that Airtable brings up. and it is very adaptable

704
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:55,085
Speaker 8:  and versatile in its own ways. Whereas in an Excel sheet, or sorry in a,

705
00:41:55,105 --> 00:41:58,165
Speaker 8:  in a Google sheet or Excel sheet, like I could build that no matter what.

706
00:41:58,195 --> 00:42:01,605
Speaker 8:  I've not, I haven't always had it broken down into the three

707
00:42:02,115 --> 00:42:06,045
Speaker 8:  buckets of my position. Like way back when in the day I used to

708
00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:09,725
Speaker 8:  just be, you know, five columns, six rows and like

709
00:42:10,105 --> 00:42:14,085
Speaker 8:  I'd call that, you know, a working day. But now I could like, I have a

710
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:17,645
Speaker 8:  note section like throughout the week if I need to like remind myself of

711
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:20,965
Speaker 8:  like, oh, you know, this is this coming up catchall again. 'cause I never

712
00:42:20,965 --> 00:42:23,725
Speaker 8:  want anything to slip through the cracks, even though it will maybe eventually,

713
00:42:23,785 --> 00:42:25,645
Speaker 8:  but it's just very versatile.

714
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:30,325
Speaker 2:  Okay, that makes sense. I I have become like a

715
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:33,885
Speaker 2:  reluctant spreadsheet person and I'm, I sort of hate that I've become a spreadsheet

716
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,805
Speaker 2:  person, but I'm slowly becoming a spreadsheet person for that exact reason.

717
00:42:36,865 --> 00:42:39,565
Speaker 2:  And it's like the more I learn about how to make spreadsheets, the more fun

718
00:42:39,565 --> 00:42:41,965
Speaker 2:  it is to make spreadsheets. Like I just learned how to do the thing where

719
00:42:41,965 --> 00:42:45,325
Speaker 2:  you take a bunch of cells and just turn it into one big white box that You

720
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:49,285
Speaker 2:  can just write in. Ah, ah, feel so good Now I'm just

721
00:42:49,285 --> 00:42:53,085
Speaker 2:  like taking notes and spreadsheets. It's bad times. What about all the stuff

722
00:42:53,145 --> 00:42:57,005
Speaker 2:  out of work? Like when you're not at work, are you as sort of ruthlessly

723
00:42:57,035 --> 00:43:00,925
Speaker 2:  organized in like personal tasks and, and personal

724
00:43:00,925 --> 00:43:01,565
Speaker 2:  life and all that stuff?

725
00:43:02,505 --> 00:43:06,245
Speaker 8:  No, I've admitted myself to being a digital

726
00:43:06,355 --> 00:43:10,125
Speaker 8:  hoarder. So like I have, I'm one of those people that has like

727
00:43:10,385 --> 00:43:13,805
Speaker 8:  way too many photos on my phone, too many unread

728
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:17,045
Speaker 8:  messages and I've tried, I think what it comes down to is like,

729
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:21,645
Speaker 8:  I also like the luxury of just letting life happen. And so

730
00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:25,765
Speaker 8:  just, you know, whatever email comes through, whatever notifications come

731
00:43:25,765 --> 00:43:29,685
Speaker 8:  through, I'll read them when I can. And it's kind of like a snapshot

732
00:43:29,685 --> 00:43:33,245
Speaker 8:  of just what I can get through in a day. Whereas if I keep trying to focus

733
00:43:33,305 --> 00:43:36,685
Speaker 8:  of organizing every moment, then I don't enjoy

734
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:40,005
Speaker 8:  like what's actually happening. 'cause if that also happens at work, right?

735
00:43:40,005 --> 00:43:43,525
Speaker 8:  That's why I also have these notes. Like what's so important for me to be

736
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:46,685
Speaker 8:  looking at someone while taking notes is because I don't wanna like take

737
00:43:46,685 --> 00:43:50,445
Speaker 8:  myself away from the creativity of it all. I know that sounds

738
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:52,885
Speaker 8:  way more like prophetic or philosophical than I

739
00:43:53,245 --> 00:43:56,485
Speaker 2:  I was gonna say that's a pretty profound insight about digital life right

740
00:43:56,485 --> 00:43:56,645
Speaker 2:  there.

741
00:43:57,705 --> 00:44:01,565
Speaker 8:  That's really good. So no I would say like, the biggest buckets I have

742
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:05,405
Speaker 8:  is like the, these big calendars for my personal,

743
00:44:05,405 --> 00:44:09,045
Speaker 8:  like how I'm organizing, but how I organize when I'm like in a team setting

744
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:13,205
Speaker 8:  is very different because how I understand how other

745
00:44:13,205 --> 00:44:16,525
Speaker 8:  people are taking information is gonna be very different. So

746
00:44:16,795 --> 00:44:20,005
Speaker 2:  This is why you're a good producer because there's like you, you're like

747
00:44:20,205 --> 00:44:23,965
Speaker 2:  left to my own devices, just let chaos, rain. But I

748
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:27,885
Speaker 2:  understand that other people are less chaotic and so I'm gonna

749
00:44:27,885 --> 00:44:30,725
Speaker 2:  have to, this is like you just described why you're good at your job and

750
00:44:30,725 --> 00:44:31,645
Speaker 2:  that's, that's very good.

751
00:44:32,025 --> 00:44:33,365
Speaker 8:  That's good at least.

752
00:44:34,665 --> 00:44:38,215
Speaker 2:  All right, awesome. Victoria, thank you very much. This is super fun. Next

753
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:41,575
Speaker 2:  on my list we have Jake Kakis, the VIRs executive editor.

754
00:44:42,655 --> 00:44:46,335
Speaker 4:  I, for the longest time just wrote down

755
00:44:46,695 --> 00:44:50,655
Speaker 4:  a manual to do list in text edit every day. I wanted it to

756
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:54,295
Speaker 4:  be as ugly and simple as possible. Okay. Very quickly realized

757
00:44:55,005 --> 00:44:58,975
Speaker 4:  that doesn't work. You need a a real system of to-dos that

758
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:02,815
Speaker 4:  can alert you at certain times on certain days. So eventually

759
00:45:03,135 --> 00:45:06,895
Speaker 4:  I found Tick Tick, which has been a game changer for me and I've

760
00:45:06,895 --> 00:45:10,535
Speaker 4:  relied on it for years now. So I, 99% of my organization

761
00:45:10,755 --> 00:45:14,655
Speaker 4:  is in Tick. Tick. Okay. Professional, but also like personal too.

762
00:45:15,355 --> 00:45:19,295
Speaker 2:  So just everything you have to do whenever, wherever, whatever ends

763
00:45:19,295 --> 00:45:20,295
Speaker 2:  up in tick tick in some way.

764
00:45:20,575 --> 00:45:24,095
Speaker 4:  I literally, I have reminders to talk to my friends

765
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,695
Speaker 4:  in Tick tick. I, yeah, I

766
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:30,775
Speaker 2:  Mean I do too. I'm laughing, I'm laughing out of like, it feels good to

767
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:32,935
Speaker 2:  know that it's not just me not at you. Don't worry.

768
00:45:33,205 --> 00:45:36,935
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah. No, Kara has like mocked me for being like, oh, I see. I was

769
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:40,295
Speaker 4:  a a to-do for you today to, to, to say hi.

770
00:45:40,915 --> 00:45:44,775
Speaker 2:  On a normal day of work, how many to-do's would you say

771
00:45:45,155 --> 00:45:46,215
Speaker 2:  are in your tick Tick.

772
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:50,615
Speaker 4:  Oh God. It's okay. So it's probably like 10. Yeah,

773
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:51,135
Speaker 2:  That's

774
00:45:51,135 --> 00:45:54,935
Speaker 4:  Not so bad. But the reason is that I don't rely on a, on a

775
00:45:55,135 --> 00:45:58,935
Speaker 4:  calendar and So I have all my entire calendar duplicated

776
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:02,855
Speaker 4:  into Tick tick. So tick tick isn't just my to-dos, it's also my

777
00:46:02,895 --> 00:46:03,455
Speaker 4:  meetings.

778
00:46:03,765 --> 00:46:07,695
Speaker 2:  Wait, so you write a to-do with a time for every meeting that

779
00:46:07,695 --> 00:46:11,535
Speaker 2:  you have to go to. Yeah. Listen Jake, I'm not judging, I'm just asking, but

780
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,735
Speaker 2:  I'm also, I'm on this one to be honest. I'm slightly judging because Tic

781
00:46:14,735 --> 00:46:17,175
Speaker 2:  Tick has like a whole calendar thing where You can sync your calendar to

782
00:46:17,255 --> 00:46:17,775
Speaker 2:  tic tick. I

783
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:21,735
Speaker 4:  Okay. They do, I tried paying for it. It's like their only paid premium

784
00:46:21,735 --> 00:46:24,375
Speaker 4:  feature. And I was like, you know what, I should pay these guys some money.

785
00:46:24,675 --> 00:46:28,535
Speaker 4:  And So I paid for it and it was total chaos. It was terrible. And

786
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:32,495
Speaker 4:  then as it turned out, and like maybe edit this out, turns

787
00:46:32,495 --> 00:46:34,415
Speaker 4:  out if you stop paying them, they don't turn it off.

788
00:46:34,995 --> 00:46:35,215
Speaker 2:  So,

789
00:46:37,365 --> 00:46:38,015
Speaker 2:  okay. So

790
00:46:38,085 --> 00:46:42,015
Speaker 4:  Cool. I'm not recommending anybody do that, but I, I

791
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:45,655
Speaker 4:  may still have access to some of their calendar features. Yeah. But basically

792
00:46:45,655 --> 00:46:49,535
Speaker 4:  that is what I do. I, if somebody sends me a Google Calendar invite,

793
00:46:49,655 --> 00:46:53,175
Speaker 4:  I accept it in Google and then I go over to Tic Tick and I type it in

794
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:56,855
Speaker 4:  because I don't know how to get the alert from Google Calendar. I don't have

795
00:46:56,855 --> 00:47:00,175
Speaker 4:  a Google Calendar app that's real, pretty and nice and simple.

796
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:02,375
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I just want, I just want a nice little list.

797
00:47:02,805 --> 00:47:06,335
Speaker 2:  Okay, so you, you like, your days are basically, you like wake up and just

798
00:47:06,335 --> 00:47:09,455
Speaker 2:  sort of follow your tick tick list down through the day. Yeah,

799
00:47:09,805 --> 00:47:13,535
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah. It's like a mix of untimed, just like

800
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:17,175
Speaker 4:  general to-dos at the top. And then I've got my list of

801
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:21,335
Speaker 4:  like basically meetings after that and then, you know, very

802
00:47:21,535 --> 00:47:25,095
Speaker 4:  pleasantly check them off and You can set things to repeat the next day,

803
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:26,135
Speaker 4:  the next week, next month.

804
00:47:26,475 --> 00:47:29,375
Speaker 2:  So do you check your calendar essentially? Never.

805
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:32,615
Speaker 4:  No, I still check my calendar all the time. Okay. But just in

806
00:47:32,615 --> 00:47:32,775
Speaker 2:  Case,

807
00:47:33,455 --> 00:47:36,575
Speaker 4:  I guess the visual element of checking the calendar is still helpful. Okay.

808
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:40,175
Speaker 4:  And I don't get that from the to do list, which is weird. 'cause otherwise

809
00:47:40,295 --> 00:47:42,615
Speaker 4:  I don't find the calendar. I find it overwhelming.

810
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:46,735
Speaker 2:  There is something So I I've, as, as you well know, as the person who edits

811
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:49,255
Speaker 2:  most of my stories, I have been writing about calendar apps for forever.

812
00:47:49,635 --> 00:47:52,775
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah. And one of the things I have found fascinating about calendar apps

813
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:56,775
Speaker 2:  is that they're mostly terrible, but the like time grid

814
00:47:57,265 --> 00:48:01,255
Speaker 2:  might be perfect. Like we might have just solved it when it comes to

815
00:48:01,255 --> 00:48:03,975
Speaker 2:  like quickly looking at a thing and getting a sense of what's going on and

816
00:48:03,975 --> 00:48:07,615
Speaker 2:  when lots of people have tried to do a new job and the time grid might just

817
00:48:07,615 --> 00:48:10,655
Speaker 2:  be perfect. And I, I have gone through the same thing where like a a list

818
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:14,575
Speaker 2:  of stuff I have to do doesn't like communicate

819
00:48:14,795 --> 00:48:18,455
Speaker 2:  the same level of understanding that just like quickly opening my calendar

820
00:48:18,455 --> 00:48:19,455
Speaker 2:  and looking at it does.

821
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:23,935
Speaker 4:  Yeah. A list is perfect for me personally, if I'm just planning out my

822
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:27,375
Speaker 4:  own day. But as soon as somebody says, when are you free? Or as soon as I

823
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:31,255
Speaker 4:  have to figure out when I mix in with somebody else's

824
00:48:31,455 --> 00:48:33,495
Speaker 4:  schedule, just gotta go to the calendar app.

825
00:48:33,565 --> 00:48:37,415
Speaker 2:  Totally. Are you a person, like do you every morning or every night,

826
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:41,175
Speaker 2:  like sit down and make a plan? Or do you just like show up and see what

827
00:48:41,175 --> 00:48:42,015
Speaker 2:  Tick tick has for you?

828
00:48:42,275 --> 00:48:46,215
Speaker 4:  Oh God no. Yeah, I just like, if it, it is either in there or it's not. Okay.

829
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:50,775
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Okay. If it's, if it's not, then I'm forgetting

830
00:48:51,055 --> 00:48:51,655
Speaker 4:  somebody's birthday.

831
00:48:52,205 --> 00:48:55,615
Speaker 2:  Okay. That's, listen, I buy it. So do you have things like

832
00:48:56,315 --> 00:49:00,055
Speaker 2:  you see a, you see a link that you wanna come back to? Where does that go?

833
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:00,655
Speaker 2:  A

834
00:49:00,655 --> 00:49:03,015
Speaker 4:  Link that I wanna come back to. Oh,

835
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:06,135
Speaker 2:  It just stays as an open tab until it destroys your computer, doesn't it?

836
00:49:06,525 --> 00:49:08,575
Speaker 4:  Yeah. No, that's a hundred percent. That's all,

837
00:49:08,575 --> 00:49:11,415
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's most people's answer. Yeah. and it, it makes me so sad. Its,

838
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:15,295
Speaker 2:  it is the answer. Yeah. I just leave it as an open Chrome tab until

839
00:49:15,315 --> 00:49:18,295
Speaker 2:  my computer beach balls and then many of them are gone. And that's just what

840
00:49:18,295 --> 00:49:19,095
Speaker 2:  it is. That's

841
00:49:19,355 --> 00:49:20,455
Speaker 4:  The cycle of life.

842
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:23,455
Speaker 2:  Where, what's your stance on email these days

843
00:49:23,785 --> 00:49:26,575
Speaker 4:  Where that's a, an existential question?

844
00:49:27,505 --> 00:49:31,095
Speaker 4:  Email is sort of like my, like B tier to do list.

845
00:49:31,285 --> 00:49:35,175
Speaker 4:  Okay. Email is like, I leave a lot of things to be like, I

846
00:49:35,175 --> 00:49:38,535
Speaker 4:  gotta get back to that. Now. The problem is when I have to respond to somebody

847
00:49:38,995 --> 00:49:41,335
Speaker 4:  and then I'm like, Hmm, it's been a month.

848
00:49:42,925 --> 00:49:46,895
Speaker 4:  Feel bad about this. I, my inbox is a total, total. I, I,

849
00:49:47,095 --> 00:49:50,975
Speaker 4:  I do clear it out. I aim for inbox zero, but like that requires

850
00:49:51,735 --> 00:49:55,695
Speaker 4:  archiving like a hundred emails a day. 'cause I get so much

851
00:49:56,255 --> 00:50:00,055
Speaker 4:  nonsense. But it is like, I don't know, I guess email is mostly

852
00:50:00,055 --> 00:50:03,175
Speaker 4:  like a secondary to do list for me. So I, check tic tick. And then I go over

853
00:50:03,175 --> 00:50:05,295
Speaker 4:  to my email and I'm like, oh, okay. What do I actually have to do?

854
00:50:05,805 --> 00:50:08,935
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah. I feel like we are a weird example because

855
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:12,535
Speaker 2:  like more than any company I've ever worked at Vox Media, just like does

856
00:50:12,535 --> 00:50:16,095
Speaker 2:  not use email. Like we, we are so Slack

857
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:20,535
Speaker 2:  run as a company that I think we, we have a different relationship with

858
00:50:20,535 --> 00:50:24,455
Speaker 2:  our inboxes than most where like if I got an email from Neli, I would

859
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:27,925
Speaker 2:  literally, it was, assume it was spam, I'd be like, why on earth would Neli

860
00:50:27,935 --> 00:50:31,045
Speaker 2:  email me? But that's not how it works most places. Yeah. Yeah. So I think

861
00:50:31,045 --> 00:50:35,005
Speaker 2:  we, we've all like, but then because we're like, we we're

862
00:50:35,005 --> 00:50:37,965
Speaker 2:  people in a newsroom whose email addresses are mostly public, we get more

863
00:50:37,965 --> 00:50:41,405
Speaker 2:  email than most people and we get more crap email than most people. So I

864
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:44,405
Speaker 2:  feel like I have reached a point where I've realized like my own email habits

865
00:50:44,405 --> 00:50:47,365
Speaker 2:  have nothing in common with most normal people's email habits.

866
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:50,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I always see journalists complaining about email and I'm like, right.

867
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:54,925
Speaker 4:  I don't think most people get like 200 spam

868
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:58,805
Speaker 4:  pitches every day. Right. Like I, and if they are, like, I,

869
00:50:58,965 --> 00:51:02,805
Speaker 4:  I don't know. I have a lot of questions, but Yeah. I, I think that we are,

870
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:06,805
Speaker 4:  are unique there and like probably email is fine if you are

871
00:51:07,535 --> 00:51:09,825
Speaker 4:  getting a more manageable amount of it. Yeah.

872
00:51:10,175 --> 00:51:12,865
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That, that seems right. So, okay. One more tick, tick question and

873
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:16,665
Speaker 2:  then I'll let you go. Yeah. Tick, tick on your computer versus

874
00:51:16,695 --> 00:51:19,905
Speaker 2:  tick tick on your phone. Do you spend more time with one or the other? Do

875
00:51:19,905 --> 00:51:20,585
Speaker 2:  you think about them differently?

876
00:51:21,535 --> 00:51:25,025
Speaker 4:  It's, it's 95% on my computer. Okay. But

877
00:51:25,525 --> 00:51:29,065
Speaker 4:  the fact that it is cross platform, I'm pretty sure it's Windows,

878
00:51:29,365 --> 00:51:32,785
Speaker 4:  Mac, Android, iOS web as well. Yeah. It's everywhere. That was

879
00:51:33,325 --> 00:51:35,905
Speaker 4:  big for me because I use a Mac and I use an Android phone.

880
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:37,985
Speaker 2:  Yeah, you're like a unicorn in the tech universe.

881
00:51:38,225 --> 00:51:41,985
Speaker 4:  I, I don't know what's wrong with me, but most of the beautiful to-do

882
00:51:41,985 --> 00:51:45,905
Speaker 4:  apps are, are Apple ecosystem only and would like to be

883
00:51:45,905 --> 00:51:49,065
Speaker 4:  able to change platforms whenever I'd like. And it's important to be able

884
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:51,545
Speaker 4:  to get, this is other things that's really nice about Tic Tick, it'll send

885
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:55,225
Speaker 4:  me reminders on my phone as well. So if I'm running late, late for a meeting,

886
00:51:55,225 --> 00:51:57,865
Speaker 4:  I'll look down my phone and it'll tell me that I'm running late. So it's

887
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:01,625
Speaker 4:  90% on the Mac, but having the ability to quickly add things

888
00:52:01,725 --> 00:52:04,025
Speaker 4:  and quickly check things on the phone key.

889
00:52:04,485 --> 00:52:07,545
Speaker 2:  Any, any feature requests. What, what would you change about your system

890
00:52:07,545 --> 00:52:08,425
Speaker 2:  if you could change something?

891
00:52:08,865 --> 00:52:12,745
Speaker 4:  I mean, look, it's a mostly free app that's like slightly buggy and

892
00:52:12,745 --> 00:52:16,345
Speaker 4:  broken but does absolutely everything you could dream of. I wouldn't change

893
00:52:16,465 --> 00:52:17,225
Speaker 4:  a thing that

894
00:52:17,225 --> 00:52:20,625
Speaker 2:  Sounds like every to-do list app. I love it. Mostly buggy wouldn't change

895
00:52:20,865 --> 00:52:24,425
Speaker 2:  anything. Yeah. Awesome. All right Jake, thank you.

896
00:52:24,805 --> 00:52:25,305
Speaker 4:  Got speed.

897
00:52:25,495 --> 00:52:28,825
Speaker 2:  Alright, we have to take one more break and then I have two more people to

898
00:52:28,825 --> 00:52:31,865
Speaker 2:  talk to and then I'll share my own system at the end. We'll be right back.

899
00:54:22,605 --> 00:54:26,005
Speaker 9:  couch from my desk where I'll just take my notepad notebook with me, kinda

900
00:54:26,005 --> 00:54:29,525
Speaker 9:  keeps me on task for the most part. And when I, you know,

901
00:54:30,025 --> 00:54:33,645
Speaker 9:  get it done, I have the joy of checking it off the list with a little pen

902
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:37,365
Speaker 9:  and sometimes I use a different pen with a different style nib and different

903
00:54:37,365 --> 00:54:41,165
Speaker 9:  color ink to check it off versus to, you know, to write

904
00:54:41,165 --> 00:54:45,125
Speaker 9:  it. So it's a, each each time's a little treat, you know, because I

905
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:48,125
Speaker 9:  love this, frankly, every time I've tried like some kind of digital

906
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:53,125
Speaker 9:  solution, I feel like I spend more time working on that and

907
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:56,525
Speaker 9:  setting up what it is than I do actually just putting it in and getting a

908
00:54:56,525 --> 00:55:00,365
Speaker 9:  task done. Awesome. Like, I tried, I tried like notion years, like

909
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:03,485
Speaker 9:  David, I I, I know every time there's a, there's a chat about this stuff

910
00:55:03,485 --> 00:55:07,445
Speaker 9:  in, in work Slack, I, I I snicker to myself and I don't weigh in because

911
00:55:08,085 --> 00:55:11,845
Speaker 9:  I, I'm all I think is like notion is a scam. Like I just can't get

912
00:55:11,845 --> 00:55:12,205
Speaker 9:  behind it.

913
00:55:14,165 --> 00:55:17,805
Speaker 2:  I mean, you're, you're right and you're wrong. I, I fully

914
00:55:17,805 --> 00:55:19,765
Speaker 2:  understand that. What kind of notebook do you have?

915
00:55:20,265 --> 00:55:23,045
Speaker 9:  So. I have alternated. Oh yeah. And this is an important thing. Yeah. Have

916
00:55:24,045 --> 00:55:27,645
Speaker 9:  notebooks are pretty cheap and I think it's fun to get like ones of different

917
00:55:27,645 --> 00:55:31,565
Speaker 9:  styles. Like I've used like this like basic black one that my wife got

918
00:55:31,565 --> 00:55:33,965
Speaker 9:  me I think off Amazon like years ago. and it looks like a whole lot like

919
00:55:34,305 --> 00:55:38,245
Speaker 9:  moskin or that kind of style. But you know, You can

920
00:55:38,245 --> 00:55:42,125
Speaker 9:  pick ones that have like different like rulings, like different like line

921
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:46,085
Speaker 9:  spacing or dots instead of like a dock grid instead of lines. Or

922
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:50,205
Speaker 9:  I've used one that had, it was really a sketchbook. I think my wife wasn't

923
00:55:50,205 --> 00:55:54,005
Speaker 9:  happy with me, but I kind of stole her sketch pad 'cause it was kind of

924
00:55:54,005 --> 00:55:57,965
Speaker 9:  fancy. But I liked having for a period of time, no lines at

925
00:55:57,965 --> 00:56:01,045
Speaker 9:  all. It was kind of like, oh, I can write big, I can write small. And some

926
00:56:01,115 --> 00:56:04,325
Speaker 9:  pens that have like a broad nib for example, force you to write bigger and

927
00:56:04,325 --> 00:56:07,765
Speaker 9:  that that can be kind of, kind of fun or adventurous. But I've kind of settled

928
00:56:07,785 --> 00:56:11,525
Speaker 9:  on like The Rhodia notepad that's spiral bound and the

929
00:56:11,525 --> 00:56:14,845
Speaker 9:  spirals on the top, which is kind of nice because You can like tear these

930
00:56:14,845 --> 00:56:17,805
Speaker 9:  sheets out, throw 'em away when you're done with them or you know, kind of

931
00:56:18,395 --> 00:56:21,645
Speaker 9:  make it, keep it nice and tidy if you really muck, muck up a, a sheet

932
00:56:22,385 --> 00:56:25,925
Speaker 9:  and then it's a, it's a good quality paper, but you don't have to like, spend

933
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,165
Speaker 9:  a lot on a notebook. I mean, only if you really want to.

934
00:56:28,565 --> 00:56:32,085
Speaker 2:  I do, I'm a big believer in the, the top spiral bound ones.

935
00:56:32,685 --> 00:56:35,005
Speaker 2:  'cause You can, like, you don't run into the crease when you're trying to

936
00:56:35,005 --> 00:56:38,925
Speaker 2:  write on the left side. It lays flat. It's, that is the way if if it's

937
00:56:38,925 --> 00:56:40,205
Speaker 2:  just gonna live on your desk. Exactly.

938
00:56:40,305 --> 00:56:43,685
Speaker 9:  And if I'm, I'm a righty. But if anyone's a lefty, that's also good. Totally

939
00:56:43,715 --> 00:56:47,005
Speaker 2:  Good. Does your notebook go everywhere with you? Or does it like live on

940
00:56:47,005 --> 00:56:49,165
Speaker 2:  your desk and, and you go to it when you need it?

941
00:56:49,645 --> 00:56:53,405
Speaker 9:  It usually lives on my desk. I don't go to many places sadly,

942
00:56:54,185 --> 00:56:54,685
Speaker 9:  but know

943
00:56:54,685 --> 00:56:54,925
Speaker 2:  That feeling.

944
00:56:55,035 --> 00:56:58,845
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I mean I'm, I'm, I'm a, I'm remote but I have gone to our

945
00:56:58,845 --> 00:57:02,565
Speaker 9:  New York office like a bunch of handful of times and

946
00:57:02,635 --> 00:57:05,805
Speaker 9:  yeah, every time I've gone I've, I've brought my notebook with me. Sometimes

947
00:57:05,805 --> 00:57:09,205
Speaker 9:  doesn't leave the bag, but, you know, hey, it's all well intentioned, right?

948
00:57:09,205 --> 00:57:11,845
Speaker 9:  Like we're, we're we're just, we're just trying here.

949
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:16,005
Speaker 2:  Absolutely. I'm I'm with you. So what about like what calendary

950
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:19,365
Speaker 2:  stuff when you're like, I have to do something next Thursday,

951
00:57:19,735 --> 00:57:20,525
Speaker 2:  where does that go?

952
00:57:20,795 --> 00:57:24,365
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I mean that's where like I always lean on Yeah. Digital stuff and that's

953
00:57:24,365 --> 00:57:28,285
Speaker 9:  really gonna be like Google, Calendar, you know, for work. I've, I've got,

954
00:57:28,285 --> 00:57:32,085
Speaker 9:  I've got my work and personal calendars of course separated personal calendars.

955
00:57:32,085 --> 00:57:34,605
Speaker 9:  My wife and I have a bunch of shared ones that are like, here's our events,

956
00:57:34,605 --> 00:57:38,565
Speaker 9:  here's our like, you know, works related stuff or hustles

957
00:57:38,565 --> 00:57:42,445
Speaker 9:  or whatever that maybe come up from time to time. So they're all color

958
00:57:42,535 --> 00:57:46,485
Speaker 9:  coded and like family functions, stuff like that, you know. So when

959
00:57:46,485 --> 00:57:48,885
Speaker 9:  it comes to like scheduling in advance, there's that. And then what I do

960
00:57:48,905 --> 00:57:52,885
Speaker 9:  for my personal, like errands, I I I just use like a

961
00:57:52,885 --> 00:57:56,805
Speaker 9:  Google Keep to do list sometimes. Like if I'm just, 'cause I, I

962
00:57:56,805 --> 00:57:59,965
Speaker 9:  think I started using GoogleKeep like years ago when I had a pixel just 'cause

963
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:03,845
Speaker 9:  it was there and it's clean and simple enough to make a little checklist

964
00:58:04,145 --> 00:58:04,805
Speaker 9:  and it

965
00:58:04,805 --> 00:58:07,845
Speaker 2:  Is the perfect, if you just want like a notes app you use every once in a

966
00:58:07,845 --> 00:58:09,445
Speaker 2:  while, Google Keep is perfect.

967
00:58:09,475 --> 00:58:13,125
Speaker 9:  Exactly. And it's like the perfect kind of thing to not care about because

968
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:17,125
Speaker 9:  it's just like, pull it up, make some check boxes. It's

969
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:19,885
Speaker 9:  like, this is the kind of thing I'm like, it's a Saturday and I've got a

970
00:58:19,885 --> 00:58:23,445
Speaker 9:  bunch of chores to get done and I want some kind of like, I, I just wanna

971
00:58:23,445 --> 00:58:26,845
Speaker 9:  write this stuff down fast. Like without like, again going to my desk and

972
00:58:26,845 --> 00:58:29,245
Speaker 9:  like writing stuff down by hand. Like that'd be nice, but I don't, I just

973
00:58:29,245 --> 00:58:32,925
Speaker 9:  don't need to on like a, a busy Saturday. So it's like, all right, it's all

974
00:58:32,925 --> 00:58:35,965
Speaker 9:  there and then check it off, check it off, check it off, I'm done. You know,

975
00:58:35,965 --> 00:58:39,365
Speaker 9:  like maybe I can put it depending on, I used to like change the color of

976
00:58:39,365 --> 00:58:41,325
Speaker 9:  it and I think I stopped caring about that too.

977
00:58:42,275 --> 00:58:45,925
Speaker 2:  Okay. So for the, that sounds very much like you think about it the same

978
00:58:45,925 --> 00:58:49,485
Speaker 2:  way you think about the physical notebook, just kind of a digital

979
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:52,725
Speaker 2:  version of like, it has pages, You can tear off as you need to,

980
00:58:53,135 --> 00:58:56,405
Speaker 2:  every, everything is kind of transitory that way. Yeah,

981
00:58:56,405 --> 00:59:00,325
Speaker 9:  Basically. And, and, and I try not to get too attached to it. I mean like,

982
00:59:00,705 --> 00:59:04,565
Speaker 9:  the amount of times like I go to write and, and like on, on my

983
00:59:04,565 --> 00:59:07,085
Speaker 9:  actual notebook and like a pen doesn't wanna start because I, oh I haven't

984
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:09,965
Speaker 9:  used that one in a while. It's like, ah, screw it. Just move on to the next

985
00:59:09,965 --> 00:59:13,565
Speaker 9:  one. Or like, I, I'm just like, so they each, each page sometimes is like

986
00:59:13,565 --> 00:59:17,245
Speaker 9:  filled with like scribbles of me getting a pen to start and you know,

987
00:59:17,245 --> 00:59:20,565
Speaker 9:  sometimes it's like, alright, whatever, it's ugly. Who, who cares? It's fleeting.

988
00:59:20,565 --> 00:59:23,405
Speaker 9:  Like it's just, just kind of be in the moment, get your stuff done for the

989
00:59:23,405 --> 00:59:27,125
Speaker 9:  day and, and move on. Because like the greater tasks are gonna be

990
00:59:27,155 --> 00:59:31,005
Speaker 9:  like probably in like your calendar appointments or for us with

991
00:59:31,005 --> 00:59:34,485
Speaker 9:  work, if it's Airtable, you know, it's kind of like, you know, you, you're,

992
00:59:34,485 --> 00:59:36,565
Speaker 9:  you're, it's what you're getting assigned and it's like, well it's, it's

993
00:59:36,565 --> 00:59:39,925
Speaker 9:  there for like me to, but I need to dive into like the micro

994
00:59:40,295 --> 00:59:44,205
Speaker 9:  tasks for, for just today. Like what do I start on right

995
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:47,605
Speaker 9:  now? What do I need to do? How do I make this mechanical? So many times like

996
00:59:47,605 --> 00:59:51,205
Speaker 9:  we, we jump, I jump into like a, a post and I think, like I tell myself,

997
00:59:51,205 --> 00:59:54,005
Speaker 9:  make it mechanical. If I don't know where to start writing, lemme start filling

998
00:59:54,025 --> 00:59:57,325
Speaker 9:  in like the, the less exciting, less cre not

999
00:59:57,725 --> 01:00:01,405
Speaker 9:  creatively demanding things that just make it, I'm just going through the

1000
01:00:01,405 --> 01:00:05,325
Speaker 9:  motions to get those gears moving. And when those gears are moving it's

1001
01:00:05,325 --> 01:00:08,885
Speaker 9:  like, okay, now I can kind of take off and, and and run So I start walking

1002
01:00:08,885 --> 01:00:10,165
Speaker 9:  basically with every little step.

1003
01:00:10,785 --> 01:00:14,605
Speaker 2:  That's great. Make it Mechanical is a pretty good like sticky note to put

1004
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:18,485
Speaker 2:  on your computer monitor every day. I like that a lot. Thanks. Anything you

1005
01:00:18,485 --> 01:00:21,205
Speaker 2:  would add to your system? If you, if you could, what do you feel like is

1006
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:22,365
Speaker 2:  missing? Or do you feel like it works?

1007
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:26,325
Speaker 9:  I would add more pens. I will always be buying more pens. Love it.

1008
01:00:27,225 --> 01:00:30,725
Speaker 9:  Better handwriting. But no, like I, I don't really know, but

1009
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:35,325
Speaker 9:  maybe like if for some other like personal projects that

1010
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:39,285
Speaker 9:  really are kind of more multi-layered, like a photo project that I'm,

1011
01:00:39,315 --> 01:00:43,285
Speaker 9:  that I kind of am, am ideating on or whatever. Like, I don't know, maybe,

1012
01:00:43,335 --> 01:00:46,125
Speaker 9:  maybe I could see myself trying again with something that's like a little

1013
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:49,885
Speaker 9:  bit more involved. Again, not notion, sorry,

1014
01:00:49,885 --> 01:00:52,485
Speaker 9:  been there, tried it. Nope. But no I don't, I don't know. I just, I guess

1015
01:00:52,485 --> 01:00:54,445
Speaker 9:  I just, I just try to keep things really simple.

1016
01:00:55,115 --> 01:00:58,325
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. I like it. All right Antonio, thank you for doing this. Appreciate

1017
01:00:58,325 --> 01:00:58,765
Speaker 2:  it. Yeah,

1018
01:00:58,785 --> 01:00:59,565
Speaker 9:  No problem. Thanks David.

1019
01:01:00,395 --> 01:01:03,935
Speaker 2:  Up next and last but certainly not least, reviews Editor

1020
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:07,255
Speaker 2:  Barbara Krasnoff. Barbara, welcome to the show. Thank

1021
01:01:07,255 --> 01:01:07,335
Speaker 10:  You.

1022
01:01:07,715 --> 01:01:09,735
Speaker 2:  So tell me about your productivity system.

1023
01:01:10,155 --> 01:01:13,815
Speaker 10:  Oh, it all depends on what I'm doing that week or what I'm using that week

1024
01:01:13,815 --> 01:01:17,735
Speaker 10:  because I've used a whole lot of things. Right now my main

1025
01:01:17,855 --> 01:01:21,775
Speaker 10:  productivity app is Notion, I use it to track most

1026
01:01:21,775 --> 01:01:25,335
Speaker 10:  of the things I do. I basically take a page, I say

1027
01:01:25,485 --> 01:01:28,575
Speaker 10:  it's my tasks for this day or this week

1028
01:01:29,315 --> 01:01:33,135
Speaker 10:  and it, there's a list of everything that needs follow up. Sometimes

1029
01:01:33,255 --> 01:01:37,175
Speaker 10:  I use a checkbox to do list. Sometimes I just type things out. Sometimes

1030
01:01:37,175 --> 01:01:41,135
Speaker 10:  there are links to the Slack messages that inspired them.

1031
01:01:41,135 --> 01:01:44,735
Speaker 10:  Sometimes I've got due dates, sometimes I don't, if anyone else looked at

1032
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:48,255
Speaker 10:  it, they wouldn't see it as an organizational system. They see it as a

1033
01:01:48,485 --> 01:01:52,255
Speaker 10:  mass of, of of stuff. But it works for me.

1034
01:01:53,135 --> 01:01:56,895
Speaker 10:  I did try to be more organized with Notion. I tried building a Notion

1035
01:01:57,215 --> 01:02:01,135
Speaker 10:  database because if you do that then You can right click

1036
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:05,055
Speaker 10:  on a Slack entry and share directly with Notion without having to

1037
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,975
Speaker 10:  do the cut and paste thing. And I tried that for about two weeks

1038
01:02:09,235 --> 01:02:13,215
Speaker 10:  and it did not work for me. A, it was much too formal. In

1039
01:02:13,215 --> 01:02:16,295
Speaker 10:  fact that's it. It was much too formal. I just couldn't deal with that.

1040
01:02:16,695 --> 01:02:19,845
Speaker 2:  I had the exact same experience. It ends up being, it, it felt so fiddly

1041
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:23,765
Speaker 2:  to me to be inside of this database thing that I

1042
01:02:23,765 --> 01:02:26,605
Speaker 2:  ended up, I went back to the same thing you did of just like, I'm just gonna

1043
01:02:26,605 --> 01:02:29,325
Speaker 2:  write down a bunch of stuff and figure it out from there.

1044
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:33,725
Speaker 10:  Absolutely. Now if there's something that I'm really afraid I'll miss like

1045
01:02:33,765 --> 01:02:37,685
Speaker 10:  a task that's due at a certain date, then I'll use

1046
01:02:37,685 --> 01:02:41,605
Speaker 10:  Google tasks. And the reason I use that is because I'm always checking my

1047
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:45,005
Speaker 10:  calendar because I'm always missing meetings. So I'm always checking the

1048
01:02:45,205 --> 01:02:49,165
Speaker 10:  calendar and that the tasks come right up on the calendar. I mostly

1049
01:02:49,295 --> 01:02:53,165
Speaker 10:  don't give them dates. I mean times I just give them a date

1050
01:02:53,165 --> 01:02:54,445
Speaker 10:  because then you have this big

1051
01:02:55,955 --> 01:02:59,725
Speaker 10:  colored bar across the top of each date and I can use that

1052
01:03:00,425 --> 01:03:04,165
Speaker 10:  to, to give myself a a sort of poke in the ass.

1053
01:03:05,585 --> 01:03:09,525
Speaker 2:  So Notion is kind of the like scratch pad for your life

1054
01:03:09,525 --> 01:03:13,245
Speaker 2:  but then if it's like this thing has to get done or else the world falls

1055
01:03:13,245 --> 01:03:15,365
Speaker 2:  apart, it goes into your calendar in some

1056
01:03:15,365 --> 01:03:19,205
Speaker 10:  Way? It goes into my calendar, yeah. Okay. And then of course there's Airtable

1057
01:03:19,205 --> 01:03:21,125
Speaker 10:  because we've got to use Airtable.

1058
01:03:21,265 --> 01:03:24,445
Speaker 2:  Do you like Airtable? We've heard some mixed things about Airtable from folks

1059
01:03:24,505 --> 01:03:24,885
Speaker 2:  so far.

1060
01:03:25,425 --> 01:03:29,125
Speaker 10:  You know, the funny thing is I first I liked it because it was fun to play

1061
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:32,525
Speaker 10:  with then I didn't like it because it's one more thing to check.

1062
01:03:33,425 --> 01:03:37,405
Speaker 10:  But now that I'm starting to pay more attention

1063
01:03:37,545 --> 01:03:41,525
Speaker 10:  to when something that I edit has to appear and So, I

1064
01:03:41,525 --> 01:03:45,365
Speaker 10:  have to look at the calendars that Alex Kranz and

1065
01:03:45,365 --> 01:03:49,125
Speaker 10:  some other people have created, now I'm finding it useful again, So I keep

1066
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:52,965
Speaker 10:  going back and forth. So on the whole, I like Airtable. I do have some

1067
01:03:52,965 --> 01:03:56,845
Speaker 10:  problems with it. I think if I spent about another two

1068
01:03:56,845 --> 01:03:59,925
Speaker 10:  weeks really, really learning it, I'd like it even better.

1069
01:04:00,605 --> 01:04:02,965
Speaker 2:  I think that's probably right. Which is the thing that drives me crazy about

1070
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:06,045
Speaker 2:  Airtable, which is it like so many of these tools including Notion actually

1071
01:04:06,225 --> 01:04:09,805
Speaker 2:  it is so incredibly powerful and I

1072
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:13,965
Speaker 2:  don't care about most of it and as a result it ends up

1073
01:04:13,965 --> 01:04:17,885
Speaker 2:  being kind of fussy and slow in some ways. Every

1074
01:04:17,885 --> 01:04:21,845
Speaker 2:  time I go back to Notion, I end up like running away towards some other simpler

1075
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,405
Speaker 2:  app. But then it can't do all the things that notion does So I go back to

1076
01:04:24,405 --> 01:04:27,445
Speaker 2:  Notion and I feel like Airtable is the same way where it's like you, if you

1077
01:04:27,445 --> 01:04:31,365
Speaker 2:  leave you can't do stuff, but if you come back it's too much stuff. And

1078
01:04:31,365 --> 01:04:35,245
Speaker 2:  this is like the productivity app nightmare that you and I have signed ourselves

1079
01:04:35,265 --> 01:04:36,045
Speaker 2:  up for somehow.

1080
01:04:36,445 --> 01:04:40,165
Speaker 10:  Yes, it really is. And the funny thing is with Notion, I'm actually starting

1081
01:04:40,165 --> 01:04:42,805
Speaker 10:  to like it more. I left it for a little while 'cause I felt it was a little

1082
01:04:42,805 --> 01:04:46,605
Speaker 10:  bit too fussy too. There was too much you could do with it and it was

1083
01:04:46,705 --> 01:04:50,445
Speaker 10:  get getting Evernote syndrome, you know, where there was just too much

1084
01:04:50,445 --> 01:04:54,245
Speaker 10:  stuff there. But then I started using it back and now I'm actually trying

1085
01:04:54,245 --> 01:04:56,565
Speaker 10:  to write, use it to write a novel. So it's,

1086
01:04:56,785 --> 01:04:58,365
Speaker 2:  Is it working well for that? Yes

1087
01:04:58,385 --> 01:05:02,085
Speaker 10:  It is because I have, I have trouble, I'm a short story writer mostly and

1088
01:05:02,085 --> 01:05:05,925
Speaker 10:  I'm trying to write a novel and I need separate chapters. I was able to

1089
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:09,725
Speaker 10:  separate them in Notion where I wasn't able to really do it in in a couple

1090
01:05:09,725 --> 01:05:13,565
Speaker 10:  of other things I tried. So we'll see what happens with that.

1091
01:05:13,745 --> 01:05:17,405
Speaker 2:  That's cool. What about outside of work? Do you have the same kind of organizational

1092
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:21,565
Speaker 2:  system for your non-work life that you do for your work life or,

1093
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,445
Speaker 2:  or do you have a totally separate way of thinking about

1094
01:05:23,445 --> 01:05:26,805
Speaker 10:  It? I've totally s well except for the fact that I'm now using Notion, trying

1095
01:05:26,825 --> 01:05:30,725
Speaker 10:  Notion Sure. With writing. But for personal to-dos, I use Tic Tic.

1096
01:05:31,235 --> 01:05:34,965
Speaker 10:  I've been using that for a long time. Unfortunately. I'm also,

1097
01:05:35,325 --> 01:05:39,085
Speaker 10:  I also tend to ignore it sometimes. So I'm, I, I'm

1098
01:05:39,325 --> 01:05:43,285
Speaker 10:  starting to actually go back, use the same Google tasks

1099
01:05:43,985 --> 01:05:47,925
Speaker 10:  format that I used with my

1100
01:05:47,925 --> 01:05:51,805
Speaker 10:  work stuff because I have a different calendar for personal

1101
01:05:52,145 --> 01:05:56,125
Speaker 10:  but you know, it sort of waves at me and says Hi, you got to do this by

1102
01:05:56,125 --> 01:05:59,965
Speaker 10:  this time. Right? Which tick tick really doesn't. And then I used

1103
01:05:59,965 --> 01:06:03,165
Speaker 10:  to use Evernote but it got too

1104
01:06:03,975 --> 01:06:07,205
Speaker 10:  large and then it got too expensive.

1105
01:06:08,185 --> 01:06:09,325
Speaker 10:  Way too expensive.

1106
01:06:09,385 --> 01:06:10,205
Speaker 2:  Agreed and agreed

1107
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:14,045
Speaker 10:  Or what I used it for, which was fairly simple stuff. So

1108
01:06:14,365 --> 01:06:18,045
Speaker 10:  I recently left Evernote in favor of

1109
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:22,085
Speaker 10:  Up Note, which is one of the lesser known ones. And

1110
01:06:22,085 --> 01:06:25,565
Speaker 10:  I'm keeping my fingers crossed because it's also very small. So who knows,

1111
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:28,805
Speaker 10:  it'll be around in five years. But it

1112
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:33,165
Speaker 10:  pulled in my Evernote stuff without much trouble. and

1113
01:06:33,185 --> 01:06:37,125
Speaker 10:  it looks a little bit like a simpler version of Evernote. I like it.

1114
01:06:37,235 --> 01:06:41,205
Speaker 10:  It's just a day by day. You can make to do notes or You can

1115
01:06:42,215 --> 01:06:46,125
Speaker 10:  write whole essays and it's, it's looks, it looks a little bit like Evernote

1116
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:46,725
Speaker 10:  if I was gonna say

1117
01:06:46,725 --> 01:06:50,565
Speaker 2:  It's like if, if Evernote were much better designed and didn't

1118
01:06:50,565 --> 01:06:54,285
Speaker 2:  have 15 years of like cruft attached to it, I feel like that's what Up Note

1119
01:06:54,285 --> 01:06:54,925
Speaker 2:  looks like. Yeah,

1120
01:06:55,235 --> 01:06:59,165
Speaker 10:  Exactly. Yeah, exactly. And they,

1121
01:06:59,165 --> 01:07:02,925
Speaker 10:  they're responsive. I had a little trouble with my getting my Evernote

1122
01:07:02,925 --> 01:07:06,365
Speaker 10:  stuff over and I sent them a note and figured I'd hear from them in about

1123
01:07:06,365 --> 01:07:09,605
Speaker 10:  two weeks and I heard from them in a few hours. Nice. So it was great.

1124
01:07:09,955 --> 01:07:13,365
Speaker 2:  That is really great. Any other apps you've tried recently that you really

1125
01:07:13,365 --> 01:07:16,725
Speaker 2:  like? You're the, you're probably the person on staff who tests as many of

1126
01:07:16,725 --> 01:07:20,605
Speaker 2:  these as I do. I just do it 'cause I'm a lunatic. You do it because you like

1127
01:07:20,605 --> 01:07:23,245
Speaker 2:  to help people on the internet. Anything else you've tried recently that

1128
01:07:23,245 --> 01:07:23,525
Speaker 2:  you like?

1129
01:07:24,145 --> 01:07:28,005
Speaker 10:  Not recently, no. I mean there are, there are several, I should have

1130
01:07:28,005 --> 01:07:30,725
Speaker 10:  brought up my article because I can never remember the names of these things.

1131
01:07:31,095 --> 01:07:35,045
Speaker 10:  There are several that are sort of on the up note level that

1132
01:07:35,045 --> 01:07:38,845
Speaker 10:  are okay and that I was trying and so

1133
01:07:39,215 --> 01:07:42,565
Speaker 10:  let's see. I used Keep occasionally,

1134
01:07:43,105 --> 01:07:45,765
Speaker 10:  but that's only for the, the odd note here and there.

1135
01:07:46,865 --> 01:07:50,565
Speaker 10:  Joplin was not bad. Mm, okay. That that,

1136
01:07:50,665 --> 01:07:54,245
Speaker 10:  that's really interesting because it uses markdown

1137
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:58,565
Speaker 10:  and my problem with it was it depends on markdown a little bit too much

1138
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:02,445
Speaker 10:  and if that doesn't bother you, it's really nice and

1139
01:08:02,505 --> 01:08:06,245
Speaker 10:  simple and you know, there is a, a very decent

1140
01:08:06,355 --> 01:08:07,365
Speaker 10:  free version available.

1141
01:08:07,465 --> 01:08:10,045
Speaker 2:  That's a good one. I have not tried that one but I I have heard a few people

1142
01:08:10,185 --> 01:08:13,885
Speaker 2:  who swear by Joplin Yeah as a, as a tool for collecting all your stuff

1143
01:08:14,505 --> 01:08:17,085
Speaker 10:  And a lot of of people swear by obsidian as well. Yes. And

1144
01:08:18,235 --> 01:08:21,885
Speaker 10:  that was what I almost went to Obsidian. It was between

1145
01:08:21,955 --> 01:08:25,645
Speaker 10:  that and up note and I ended up with

1146
01:08:25,745 --> 01:08:29,325
Speaker 10:  Up note. I also use a notebook. I mean I actually write

1147
01:08:29,555 --> 01:08:30,125
Speaker 2:  What a concept

1148
01:08:30,505 --> 01:08:34,365
Speaker 10:  You know in a real notebook so there's that as well. I always

1149
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:38,325
Speaker 10:  carry something like that around with me because you know, sometimes

1150
01:08:38,505 --> 01:08:42,405
Speaker 10:  you just have to grab something and write down a very quick note. I have

1151
01:08:42,405 --> 01:08:46,285
Speaker 10:  not found it as easy to, you know, grab

1152
01:08:46,305 --> 01:08:49,885
Speaker 10:  my phone and talk into it. Sometimes I do, but not all the time.

1153
01:08:50,315 --> 01:08:50,605
Speaker 10:  This

1154
01:08:50,605 --> 01:08:53,965
Speaker 2:  All makes a lot of sense to me. It just sounds like a lot of things. That's

1155
01:08:53,965 --> 01:08:57,845
Speaker 2:  my, my only, my only immediate reaction is like, this strikes me

1156
01:08:57,845 --> 01:09:01,565
Speaker 2:  as a lot of places just to check for stuff

1157
01:09:02,185 --> 01:09:05,925
Speaker 2:  and especially like, you know, you the the to-do lists. I, as soon as you

1158
01:09:05,925 --> 01:09:08,405
Speaker 2:  said, I also use Tic Tick, I was like, do you remember to check Tick tick?

1159
01:09:08,405 --> 01:09:12,245
Speaker 2:  And you said you don't but, so do you ever feel like you, you want to

1160
01:09:12,645 --> 01:09:16,485
Speaker 2:  consolidate everything into fewer places or does the system you have work

1161
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:16,765
Speaker 2:  for you?

1162
01:09:17,845 --> 01:09:21,645
Speaker 10:  I, I should probably consolidate a little bit. My biggest problem was with

1163
01:09:21,645 --> 01:09:24,805
Speaker 10:  the to-do list with the Tick Tick versus Google tasks.

1164
01:09:26,425 --> 01:09:30,365
Speaker 10:  And I sometimes think I need to go to tick tick, look at all the

1165
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:33,405
Speaker 10:  stuff that's like months old that I haven't done.

1166
01:09:34,075 --> 01:09:34,365
Speaker 2:  Sure.

1167
01:09:34,985 --> 01:09:38,965
Speaker 10:  You know, and go through that and get rid of it. I'm so used to

1168
01:09:38,965 --> 01:09:42,725
Speaker 10:  using it then sometimes I think I should be using Google tests. I should

1169
01:09:42,725 --> 01:09:46,525
Speaker 10:  be just using Tick Tick better. But those are the only two.

1170
01:09:46,805 --> 01:09:49,725
Speaker 10:  'cause everything else like Notion I use for almost everything else

1171
01:09:50,385 --> 01:09:53,885
Speaker 10:  fairly, I like playing with the other stuff but

1172
01:09:54,285 --> 01:09:57,445
Speaker 10:  I always, I usually tend to come back to that. And

1173
01:09:58,065 --> 01:10:01,765
Speaker 10:  the only other thing I really use is writing in a notebook and that's

1174
01:10:02,595 --> 01:10:05,805
Speaker 10:  just something I carry around with me. And then if any, if there's anything

1175
01:10:05,805 --> 01:10:09,365
Speaker 10:  in there that I need permanently, then I move it over.

1176
01:10:09,795 --> 01:10:13,765
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. Yeah, again, I, I keep trying to quit Notion and I

1177
01:10:13,765 --> 01:10:15,325
Speaker 2:  keep coming back to Notion So I

1178
01:10:15,405 --> 01:10:19,285
Speaker 10:  I feel I know. And by the way, if you find anything that you think I should

1179
01:10:19,285 --> 01:10:23,005
Speaker 10:  be trying or playing with or adding to my list of note taking apps,

1180
01:10:23,065 --> 01:10:26,525
Speaker 10:  please, please tell me because I'm always playing with new ones.

1181
01:10:26,845 --> 01:10:29,805
Speaker 2:  I will, I'll keep you posted for sure. All right Barbara, thank you so much.

1182
01:10:30,055 --> 01:10:31,325
Speaker 10:  Thank you. This was a lot of fun.

1183
01:10:31,995 --> 01:10:35,325
Speaker 2:  Well that was fascinating. There are some things in there I'm definitely

1184
01:10:35,325 --> 01:10:39,285
Speaker 2:  gonna steal immediately. Like Jay's shared doc of stuff to talk about with

1185
01:10:39,285 --> 01:10:43,125
Speaker 2:  his partner and Victoria's Wall calendar. I also think the

1186
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:46,205
Speaker 2:  idea of just like writing all your stuff down no matter what as a to-do list

1187
01:10:46,225 --> 01:10:50,165
Speaker 2:  is great. Also Kara is definitely right. Everyone should just

1188
01:10:50,165 --> 01:10:54,125
Speaker 2:  take more notes on everything all the time. But before I

1189
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:58,005
Speaker 2:  make anything work better in the spirit of sharing and openness, here's

1190
01:10:58,005 --> 01:11:01,045
Speaker 2:  how my system currently works. I've tried

1191
01:11:01,495 --> 01:11:05,205
Speaker 2:  everything. Like I, I actually feel fair

1192
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:09,325
Speaker 2:  saying that I've tried every app that there is to try. I've

1193
01:11:09,325 --> 01:11:12,965
Speaker 2:  tried a lot of systems and I've settled on this thing that you hear a lot

1194
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:16,685
Speaker 2:  called time blocking. And basically the idea is at the beginning of every

1195
01:11:16,685 --> 01:11:19,645
Speaker 2:  day or the night before or whenever you wanna do it, you sit down and you

1196
01:11:19,645 --> 01:11:23,485
Speaker 2:  go through your calendar and you give every minute a job, right?

1197
01:11:23,665 --> 01:11:27,605
Speaker 2:  So things like projects you have to get done. You don't just put them on

1198
01:11:27,605 --> 01:11:30,925
Speaker 2:  a list, you put them on your calendar at a time because the theory is if

1199
01:11:30,925 --> 01:11:34,205
Speaker 2:  you don't give things the time to get done they won't get done. And So

1200
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:38,845
Speaker 2:  I for a long time would have things like take a shower and

1201
01:11:39,025 --> 01:11:42,485
Speaker 2:  eat breakfast as calendar events and then that started to seem

1202
01:11:42,835 --> 01:11:46,325
Speaker 2:  bananas. So now it's just an hour of like get ready in the morning

1203
01:11:46,745 --> 01:11:50,605
Speaker 2:  on my calendar every day. But I put sit and watch

1204
01:11:50,605 --> 01:11:54,285
Speaker 2:  movies on my calendar like downtime is a thing I schedule now

1205
01:11:54,285 --> 01:11:57,725
Speaker 2:  because the idea is if you put everything in your calendar in a way that

1206
01:11:57,725 --> 01:12:01,605
Speaker 2:  works and makes sense, You can trust that when you say

1207
01:12:01,605 --> 01:12:05,045
Speaker 2:  downtime, You can do downtime and that has actually been really meaningful

1208
01:12:05,045 --> 01:12:08,685
Speaker 2:  for me. And the app I use most is an app called Note Plan. It's

1209
01:12:08,845 --> 01:12:11,485
Speaker 2:  mostly on Apple devices but there's a web app now that works pretty well

1210
01:12:11,485 --> 01:12:15,325
Speaker 2:  too. And its thing is it's basically a combination of

1211
01:12:16,245 --> 01:12:20,125
Speaker 2:  calendar notes and to-Do List app. And I wouldn't say it's

1212
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:23,205
Speaker 2:  amazing at any of those things, but it does all of them

1213
01:12:23,475 --> 01:12:27,365
Speaker 2:  serviceably well and I love that So I can open the app and

1214
01:12:27,365 --> 01:12:30,805
Speaker 2:  it shows me all my calendar events in the right sidebar for the day and all

1215
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:34,525
Speaker 2:  of my reminders. I mostly use Apple Reminders now because I use an

1216
01:12:34,525 --> 01:12:38,365
Speaker 2:  iPhone and it's just easy to use Siri to dump stuff into reminders and

1217
01:12:38,365 --> 01:12:42,165
Speaker 2:  then it shows up in that sidebar in note plan. And so every morning I'll

1218
01:12:42,165 --> 01:12:45,285
Speaker 2:  sit down, I'll look at my calendar events, I'll look at my to-do list and

1219
01:12:45,285 --> 01:12:49,205
Speaker 2:  I will basically write a bulleted list of everything in order that I

1220
01:12:49,205 --> 01:12:53,085
Speaker 2:  plan to do that day. And then the goal if all goes right is just to

1221
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:57,125
Speaker 2:  plow through that every single day. Something about writing it all down and

1222
01:12:57,125 --> 01:13:00,765
Speaker 2:  sort of seeing it in one place and also knowing like what do I need to do

1223
01:13:00,765 --> 01:13:04,725
Speaker 2:  next is a question I can answer just by opening an app is very

1224
01:13:04,725 --> 01:13:08,445
Speaker 2:  handy. I would say I switch away from Note Plan like once every

1225
01:13:08,445 --> 01:13:12,165
Speaker 2:  three weeks. I've tried Notion, I've tried Obsidian,

1226
01:13:12,765 --> 01:13:15,845
Speaker 2:  I used Obsidian for a long time actually I think that app is very good. I

1227
01:13:15,845 --> 01:13:19,645
Speaker 2:  go to Evernote periodically. I tried Rome, I really like WorkFlowy

1228
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:23,245
Speaker 2:  because my brain just kind of thinks in bullets and outlines and

1229
01:13:23,355 --> 01:13:27,125
Speaker 2:  that worked for me really well. I've tried all of the apps

1230
01:13:27,275 --> 01:13:31,125
Speaker 2:  that there are for doing this kind of thing and note plan because

1231
01:13:31,195 --> 01:13:34,445
Speaker 2:  it's that combo of calendar reminders and notes all in one place

1232
01:13:35,145 --> 01:13:38,885
Speaker 2:  has just worked for me. I do live out of my calendar. I'm very much the kind

1233
01:13:38,885 --> 01:13:42,245
Speaker 2:  of person that if I don't put something on the calendar, it's not going to

1234
01:13:42,245 --> 01:13:46,045
Speaker 2:  happen. I just don't trust my brain and I trust my calendar.

1235
01:13:46,345 --> 01:13:50,245
Speaker 2:  So. I don't even think, right? Like I that lingering sense of like, oh,

1236
01:13:50,665 --> 01:13:54,445
Speaker 2:  did I schedule that thing? What was I supposed to be doing today? I don't

1237
01:13:54,445 --> 01:13:58,245
Speaker 2:  have that because I just assume it's all on my calendar. I

1238
01:13:58,245 --> 01:14:02,005
Speaker 2:  miss things occasionally because I forgot to schedule them. But I trust

1239
01:14:02,025 --> 01:14:06,005
Speaker 2:  my calendar a lot. I use an app called Fantastical, which

1240
01:14:06,205 --> 01:14:09,565
Speaker 2:  I think is wonderful and again has reminders. Integration, So. I can see

1241
01:14:09,565 --> 01:14:13,485
Speaker 2:  my tasks in there too. I can schedule stuff. Google, Calendar

1242
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:17,285
Speaker 2:  works fine. I think the Outlook calendar is kind of hideous, but

1243
01:14:17,285 --> 01:14:20,765
Speaker 2:  Google Calendar is solid. It all works fine. I don't have particular

1244
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:24,245
Speaker 2:  religion when it comes to calendar apps, but I like fantastical a lot.

1245
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:28,245
Speaker 2:  Like I said, I use Apple Reminders, I've switched between all the to-Do lists.

1246
01:14:28,285 --> 01:14:31,565
Speaker 2:  I think to do list is great. I think Tick Tick, which a bunch of my colleagues

1247
01:14:31,565 --> 01:14:35,325
Speaker 2:  have mentioned is also great. But for me, just being able to

1248
01:14:35,325 --> 01:14:38,845
Speaker 2:  like fire up Siri, say remind me to

1249
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:42,845
Speaker 2:  take out the trash at 9:00 PM tomorrow. But just being able to

1250
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:46,645
Speaker 2:  fire up Siri, say Remind me to take out the trash at 9:00 PM

1251
01:14:46,885 --> 01:14:50,805
Speaker 2:  tomorrow and have it appear in the rest of my system is amazing.

1252
01:14:51,705 --> 01:14:55,085
Speaker 2:  The other part of my system, I would say is what I use for bigger

1253
01:14:55,165 --> 01:14:58,685
Speaker 2:  projects, like stories I'm working on or vergecast

1254
01:14:58,685 --> 01:15:02,525
Speaker 2:  episodes or bigger things, especially things with due dates and

1255
01:15:02,805 --> 01:15:06,565
Speaker 2:  deadlines. I have used literally

1256
01:15:06,565 --> 01:15:10,365
Speaker 2:  every app that exists to do this kind of thing. I've used Notion where I

1257
01:15:10,365 --> 01:15:14,125
Speaker 2:  built a really beautiful database and Kanban board that has everything just

1258
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:17,965
Speaker 2:  right. I've used what basically you could just call like a big

1259
01:15:18,035 --> 01:15:22,005
Speaker 2:  long list of stuff. There's a productivity blog that I read a long time

1260
01:15:22,005 --> 01:15:25,925
Speaker 2:  ago that says, one thing a lot of CEOs do is just have a

1261
01:15:25,925 --> 01:15:29,845
Speaker 2:  long ass list. So I've tried the long ass list. Right now I'm using an app

1262
01:15:29,845 --> 01:15:33,085
Speaker 2:  called Capacities that I think is pretty clever. It has some neat

1263
01:15:33,085 --> 01:15:36,405
Speaker 2:  organizational tools, but it might be too complicated. I might end up back

1264
01:15:36,405 --> 01:15:39,485
Speaker 2:  at Notion before I get frustrated with it and switch to something else. Again,

1265
01:15:39,865 --> 01:15:43,245
Speaker 2:  the note plan thing is pretty settled for me, but this idea of like how do

1266
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:47,205
Speaker 2:  I manage all of the different sorts of things that I need to get

1267
01:15:47,205 --> 01:15:50,645
Speaker 2:  done in one way, shape, or form that's bigger than just like a task I can

1268
01:15:50,645 --> 01:15:54,565
Speaker 2:  write on one line I have not solved and I spend a lot of time thinking about

1269
01:15:54,565 --> 01:15:58,405
Speaker 2:  it because I think when I get it right somehow everything will become

1270
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:03,325
Speaker 2:  more pleasant and doable in my life. Probably not, but

1271
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:06,685
Speaker 2:  it's worth a try. All of this is to say, I think the big thing I've learned

1272
01:16:06,685 --> 01:16:10,245
Speaker 2:  from this is that I switched too much and this anarchy is

1273
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:14,405
Speaker 2:  bad. All of my information is in lots of places. I don't

1274
01:16:14,475 --> 01:16:18,165
Speaker 2:  necessarily know how to use each of these apps to their

1275
01:16:18,165 --> 01:16:21,565
Speaker 2:  fullest extent, which is a thing I talked about a lot with Laura Ma Martin.

1276
01:16:21,945 --> 01:16:24,605
Speaker 2:  The idea of like really understanding the settings and being able to make

1277
01:16:24,605 --> 01:16:28,245
Speaker 2:  the most of the app. I don't have any of that and I gotta work on that. And

1278
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:32,245
Speaker 2:  to that point, one thing that I'm learning both from talking to Laura last

1279
01:16:32,245 --> 01:16:35,645
Speaker 2:  week and talking to all my colleagues here is that simplicity and

1280
01:16:35,845 --> 01:16:39,685
Speaker 2:  consolidation actually go a really long way. Or digital lives

1281
01:16:39,865 --> 01:16:43,605
Speaker 2:  by nature kind of tend to spiral, right? We're on so many platforms,

1282
01:16:43,605 --> 01:16:47,245
Speaker 2:  we're in so many apps, we do so many different kinds of things all day and

1283
01:16:47,245 --> 01:16:51,205
Speaker 2:  we're interacting with these endless feeds full of stuff that it just

1284
01:16:51,205 --> 01:16:55,125
Speaker 2:  feels like the entropy of it all feels inevitable. So, I,

1285
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:58,845
Speaker 2:  think picking a place or a couple of places that are your places

1286
01:16:59,495 --> 01:17:02,365
Speaker 2:  feels really important. And I think that actually might be more important

1287
01:17:02,365 --> 01:17:06,245
Speaker 2:  than what those places are. Just knowing that there are a

1288
01:17:06,245 --> 01:17:10,125
Speaker 2:  couple of them, whether it's telling people that email and text is better

1289
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:13,845
Speaker 2:  than Slack for you, or throwing your entire life no matter

1290
01:17:13,845 --> 01:17:17,605
Speaker 2:  what it is into a to do list or just being like, I am a person who

1291
01:17:17,635 --> 01:17:20,725
Speaker 2:  uses Google Docs for everything. I think less is more,

1292
01:17:21,515 --> 01:17:24,845
Speaker 2:  even if the tools aren't perfect and actually require a little more busy

1293
01:17:24,845 --> 01:17:28,805
Speaker 2:  work. You know that phrase a single source of truth. I think having

1294
01:17:28,805 --> 01:17:32,605
Speaker 2:  that for your digital life might actually be more important and

1295
01:17:32,635 --> 01:17:36,005
Speaker 2:  more useful than building these perfect beautiful

1296
01:17:36,005 --> 01:17:39,565
Speaker 2:  interlocking systems that I've been trying to build myself for way too many

1297
01:17:39,565 --> 01:17:43,525
Speaker 2:  years at this point. Anyway, lots to think about. Lots of good

1298
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:47,285
Speaker 2:  ideas. I am probably gonna go blow up my entire

1299
01:17:47,285 --> 01:17:50,485
Speaker 2:  productivity system because that is what I tend to do when things like this

1300
01:17:50,485 --> 01:17:53,965
Speaker 2:  happen. And we have one more episode actually coming up in this series,

1301
01:17:54,175 --> 01:17:57,805
Speaker 2:  which I suspect will have some insight into this as well. We're gonna talk

1302
01:17:57,805 --> 01:18:01,525
Speaker 2:  about one of the OG all time, most popular

1303
01:18:01,525 --> 01:18:04,925
Speaker 2:  productivity apps and kind of how the world changed around it.

1304
01:18:05,345 --> 01:18:08,445
Speaker 2:  But for now, that's it for The Vergecast today. Thank you to everybody who
