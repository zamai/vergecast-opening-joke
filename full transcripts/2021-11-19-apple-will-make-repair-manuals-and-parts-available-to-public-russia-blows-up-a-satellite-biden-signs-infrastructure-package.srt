00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,600
Speaker 1:  This week on the verge cast mechanic, Kelly joins the show. You talk about

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,230
Speaker 1:  the new $1 trillion infrastructure package, what it means for broadband

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,130
Speaker 1:  EVs, all kinds of other things. Lauren Gruss joins the show. We talk about

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,030
Speaker 1:  Russia, blown up a satellite in space. What's going on with space X and trans.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,850
Speaker 1:  During the show we talk about Apple's new repair system and lots of other

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,500
Speaker 1:  things that's come up on the Rochester. Now

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,210
Speaker 2:  The future is here and that's as true in banking as it is. In fact,

Speaker 2:  problems to benefit millions of customers like an industry, leading

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,320
Speaker 2:  AI powered, intelligent assistant Eno, or their fraud detection and

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,220
Speaker 2:  prevention capabilities or improving the customer service experience

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,910
Speaker 2:  capital one's AI and machine learning capabilities are at the forefront of

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,840
Speaker 2:  what's possible in banking today. Learn more about how capital one

Speaker 2:  customers@capitalone.com slash tech.

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,180
Speaker 3:  You probably know that smartphones really got started with the iPhone, but

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,930
Speaker 3:  did you know there was an innovative app driven smartphone six years

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,470
Speaker 3:  before it

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,730
Speaker 4:  Took off like a rocket. Everybody wanted this product

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,150
Speaker 3:  And act in a new documentary from the verge called springboard the secret

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,660
Speaker 3:  history of the first real smartphone. We look at a tiny startup called

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,410
Speaker 3:  handspring that tried to create the modern phone before anybody was ready

25
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,190
Speaker 3:  for it. You can watch springboard now for free on the verge TV app

28
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,460
Speaker 1:  Hello, and welcome to the broadcast, the flagship program with

29
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,450
Speaker 1:  infrastructure roads, bridges, ports. We've been talking about them for

30
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,080
Speaker 1:  10 years on this podcast. And today we're going to do it again. I'm your

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,090
Speaker 1:  friend Nila. Dear brown is here. I

32
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,800
Speaker 3:  Am a week cause it's

33
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,040
Speaker 1:  Infrastructure week. Oh, there you go. Well done mechanic. Kelly's here.

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,670
Speaker 1:  Hi McKenna. Hey, McKenna is not amused, but my

35
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,800
Speaker 1:  infrastructure jokes, I am just laughing.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,360
Speaker 2:  No, it's great. It's finally

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,260
Speaker 1:  Infrastructure week. It didn't. I mean your policy reporter, I feel like

38
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,560
Speaker 1:  you've been living in the moment of it's infrastructure week

39
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,460
Speaker 1:  four or five years. So I'm happy that you got this

40
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,460
Speaker 1:  when there's a lot going on this week, McKenna is going to talk to us about

41
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,730
Speaker 1:  the infrastructure package, what it means for broadband electric vehicle

42
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,420
Speaker 1:  chargers. There's another bill coming with tax credits, three bites. There's

43
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,350
Speaker 1:  FCC drama. A little later in the show. Loren Grush is going to join us. There's

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,280
Speaker 1:  drama in space as well. Satellite explosions for real, it's like a real thing.

45
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,760
Speaker 1:  And then Alex, Cranz gonna join us at the end of the show. That's some apple

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,340
Speaker 1:  stuff in somebody around, but let's start with the infrastructure package.

47
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,970
Speaker 1:  It is a long time coming. President Trump famously promised an

48
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,810
Speaker 1:  infrastructure package. A hijack for many reasons, never came to pass

49
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,160
Speaker 1:  Biden obviously came into office promising a huge program called

50
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,970
Speaker 1:  build back better, which was then broken up into two bills. The first trunk

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Speaker 1:  passed. There's a second potentially more controversial bill coming.

52
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,480
Speaker 1:  That's coming to a vote as well. What passed now? It's a trillion dollar

53
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,240
Speaker 1:  package. What's in there for, for people who are interested in tech.

54
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,650
Speaker 6:  So Monday Biden actually signed the bill at the Congress

55
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,550
Speaker 6:  and the house and the Senate approved it finally a couple of weeks ago and

56
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,610
Speaker 6:  they held this like gigantic signing ceremony at the white house. There was

57
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,270
Speaker 6:  like a whole band. It was like kind of cool to actually see an accomplishment

58
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,960
Speaker 6:  like that under like some administration where there's actually

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,200
Speaker 6:  like a speech in a white house and like all of this kind of stuff in the

60
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,590
Speaker 6:  background of a signing. So that was cool. But essentially it's a $1 trillion

61
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,730
Speaker 6:  deal that includes a lot of money to fix bridges and roads

62
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,210
Speaker 6:  and the things that we drive and walk over every day. But then also there's

63
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,300
Speaker 6:  a lot of stuff in there that touches on tech and a lot of things that the

64
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,990
Speaker 6:  verge covers primarily broadband expansion. Of

65
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,470
Speaker 6:  course, a lot of people in the country do not have access to high-speed broadband.

66
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,190
Speaker 6:  This is an issue we have been trying to solve for how many decades now all

67
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,810
Speaker 6:  of them, exactly. All of the decades,

68
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,230
Speaker 1:  George Washington was like, here's my platform. He was

69
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,940
Speaker 6:  Like, why can't I download apps fast enough? But anyways,

70
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,910
Speaker 6:  so the bill got approved and that means that there's $65 billion

71
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,900
Speaker 6:  now headed to states to get infrastructure

72
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,410
Speaker 6:  built so people can have those in-home connections. And what the administration

73
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,250
Speaker 6:  is saying is that this money is going to make sure every household in America

74
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,790
Speaker 6:  is connected to high-speed broadband by the end of the decade, which, you

75
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,580
Speaker 6:  know, we don't know, we can't really predict the future, but that's a really

76
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,650
Speaker 6:  cool goal. If they're able to move that,

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,120
Speaker 1:  I put that in the context of like, you know, historic programs to electrify

78
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,510
Speaker 1:  every home or to get every house on the phone network.

79
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,590
Speaker 1:  $65 billion does not seem like a lot of money, right. In the context of a

80
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,920
Speaker 1:  trillion dollar package. Even in the context of that number, it's not a big

81
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,760
Speaker 1:  number. I guess my two questions are, is it enough? And it's going to the

82
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,750
Speaker 1:  states, like, how is it going to be administered? Like, how does it work?

83
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,060
Speaker 1:  Do like, do I just get a check? Are you just gonna write me a check? And

84
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,940
Speaker 1:  I can go find a broadband provider? Like, how's it, how's it gonna happen?

85
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,050
Speaker 6:  Unfortunately, that's not really the case. That would be kind of sick if

86
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,920
Speaker 6:  it was. But basically the $65 billion is a smaller number.

87
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,760
Speaker 6:  At first, the Biden administration this year promised a hundred billion,

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,510
Speaker 6:  but the 65 is kind of what was reconciled between

89
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,510
Speaker 6:  Republicans and Democrats. Many Republicans who were like

90
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,280
Speaker 6:  broadband is not infrastructure, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. And

91
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,070
Speaker 6:  we came to agreement with broadband is infrastructure enough for 65 billion,

92
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,610
Speaker 6:  I guess, was the logic. I don't know. But basically it comes down to

93
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,030
Speaker 6:  subsidizing right? And giving the whole problem with

94
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,300
Speaker 6:  broadband expansion is that you look at Verizon, you'll get 18 T you look

95
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,630
Speaker 6:  at all your ISP, right? And they just don't have the

96
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,260
Speaker 6:  incentive to connect one family living in the

97
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,500
Speaker 6:  middle of nowhere, Nebraska. I can say that cause I'm from Nebraska.

98
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,570
Speaker 6:  Right? So they just don't get the right return on investment. So these costs

99
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,410
Speaker 6:  need to be subsidized in order for the infrastructure to be built.

100
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,110
Speaker 6:  Now, the interesting thing that we need to talk about here, especially is

101
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,830
Speaker 6:  like this, isn't going to be fiber to every home. And that's

102
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,650
Speaker 6:  something that was a little sad for Democrats and more progressive. This

103
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,520
Speaker 6:  is, this is going to be a process that has to do with some fiber, with

104
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,090
Speaker 6:  some other cables, you know, co-ax and then also like wireless

105
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,420
Speaker 6:  5g services, I guess, is here.

106
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,800
Speaker 6:  So it's going to be a mix of all of these things in order to get people connected.

107
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,010
Speaker 6:  Sure.

108
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,250
Speaker 1:  Or the state's in charge is the FCC in charge like

109
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,450
Speaker 6:  Notably the FCC was left out of the

110
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,110
Speaker 6:  infrastructure package pretty broadly, which I think we can kind of get into

111
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,590
Speaker 6:  when we talked about the FCC later, but the FCC has been unable to really

112
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,890
Speaker 6:  do anything this year. They have had like a two to

113
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,160
Speaker 6:  stalemate with net neutrality being rolled back. There's a lot of questions

114
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,940
Speaker 6:  about the extent to which the FCC has any authority over

115
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,480
Speaker 6:  broadband. So the money is being sent to the commerce department

116
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,200
Speaker 6:  essentially to offer, you know, kind of like grant programs to states

117
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,040
Speaker 6:  who basically say, Hey, we have this really cool plan. We need

118
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,680
Speaker 6:  this much money. Can you give it to us? And that's kind of how it's going

119
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,580
Speaker 6:  to be solved so far

120
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,410
Speaker 3:  Broadband, you mentioned it could be 5g. It could be co-ax. Are we

121
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,220
Speaker 3:  still working with the definition of broadband that we've been working with

122
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,180
Speaker 3:  here in the U S which is like somewhat 25 down three up something insane

123
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,810
Speaker 3:  like that? Yeah.

124
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,560
Speaker 6:  It's twenty-five three still. And now this year there was some senators who

125
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,680
Speaker 6:  saw, you know, an opportunity in the infrastructure build to be like, Hey,

126
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,670
Speaker 6:  we need 100 over 100 or at least, you know, 100 over

127
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,570
Speaker 6:  something that, you know, is still much faster than three megabytes

128
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,170
Speaker 6:  upload. And there were some letters, there were some discussions, right.

129
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,800
Speaker 6:  But that did not end up making it in the final infrastructure package that,

130
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,680
Speaker 6:  and then, so I guess this leads into the FCC kind of having to make this

131
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,370
Speaker 6:  decision later and maybe with a democratic majority fingers crossed, I

132
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,330
Speaker 6:  guess if that's what you want, they can change that definition

133
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,120
Speaker 6:  later once they're able to do anything.

134
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,820
Speaker 1:  Yeah. We'll get to that. That is a whole swirl of drama, which is kind of

135
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,750
Speaker 1:  interesting, but just on broadband just to lay it out. So the commerce

136
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,780
Speaker 1:  department gets $65 billion and then the state's going to the commerce department

137
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,530
Speaker 1:  and say, we've got a cool plan to pay at and T to

138
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,380
Speaker 1:  wire every house in Wisconsin, which I can say, cause I'm from Wisconsin.

139
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,980
Speaker 1:  And then the Congresswoman is like, okay, here's the money who makes sure

140
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,770
Speaker 1:  that they don't just waste it. That 18 T decision is blow it because the

141
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,070
Speaker 1:  immediate reaction from a lot of people, like in my mentions and I was like,

142
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,850
Speaker 1:  I'm excited about this was I've heard these lies from Verizon before.

143
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,320
Speaker 1:  Right, right. Cause it's true. Like I think the state of New Jersey has

144
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,130
Speaker 1:  paid Verizon like $10 billion to give one house fires

145
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,850
Speaker 1:  and they just hit like there's lawsuits and it's deeply corrupt. And I think

146
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,360
Speaker 1:  there's a lot of skepticism here. There's also, I think in,

147
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,410
Speaker 1:  I noticed you get the same replies. I do. Sometimes there's a lot of people

148
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,320
Speaker 1:  that are like, just give the money to Starling. Right. Cause they'll do it.

149
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,250
Speaker 1:  And you know, there's like, there's a lot to unpack there, but I

150
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,000
Speaker 1:  think people are rightfully skeptical of the big broadband

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,870
Speaker 1:  providers who have not done the work they should have done even with some

152
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,470
Speaker 1:  subsidies already. And so like what makes this money? What, what

153
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,230
Speaker 1:  mechanism makes this money more effective this time? Do you think it's

154
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,200
Speaker 6:  Unfortunate because I really, I don't know. That's we always want to be able

155
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,410
Speaker 6:  to make these promises, right? The FCC Democrats want to be able to say,

156
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,410
Speaker 6:  well, this money is going to do what you want it to do, but the only effective

157
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,140
Speaker 6:  enforcement that we've had over the past, I don't even know if we can call

158
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,860
Speaker 6:  it an effective, but the only like working enforcement that we've really

159
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,790
Speaker 6:  had has been, you know, very thorough FCC investigations

160
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,690
Speaker 6:  that take a lot of time, but then also like state attorney general lawsuits.

161
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,200
Speaker 6:  So what

162
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,980
Speaker 1:  I can imagine is there might be something in some contract, a

163
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,820
Speaker 1:  state or a locality makes with a broadband provider

164
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,630
Speaker 1:  to maybe essentially it later, if they don't fulfill it to have like the

165
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,530
Speaker 1:  state ag go after them or something. But it is hard, you know, with

166
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,430
Speaker 1:  net neutrality the way it is. And with so much skepticism over title two

167
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,700
Speaker 1:  and authority, it's hard to say, you know what enforcement will look like

168
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,360
Speaker 1:  in the future. I just want to unwind that because you've said it a couple

169
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,780
Speaker 1:  of times, what you mean by net neutrality is not actual net neutrality. It's

170
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,680
Speaker 1:  when net neutrality was rolled back, the FCC actually gave up its

171
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,220
Speaker 1:  authority to regulate broadband at all, but they weren't just like, we're

172
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,790
Speaker 1:  not doing that neutrality. They're like, we now have prohibited ourselves

173
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,120
Speaker 1:  from doing anything. Right. So their ability to even like, look at this and

174
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,250
Speaker 1:  enforce, this is constraint.

175
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,240
Speaker 6:  It depends on the interpretation rank. The FCC is just a house full of

176
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,840
Speaker 6:  lawyers,

177
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,650
Speaker 1:  Furnished building in DC. It's so

178
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,400
Speaker 6:  Fun, Florida. We love it. But it's essentially like a, it's just like a house

179
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,250
Speaker 6:  full of lawyers who have like different interpretations of what they can

180
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,060
Speaker 6:  do. So like the FCC could do something and then, oh my God, you know,

181
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,510
Speaker 6:  some lawyer somewhere might Sue them and say it's illegal. So

182
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,530
Speaker 6:  essentially like they did give up like that. Sure. I

183
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,010
Speaker 6:  think a lot of people on the left and like Democrats and progressives will

184
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,760
Speaker 6:  say, well, when they did give up title to net neutrality rollback, they

185
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,570
Speaker 6:  did get rid of this authority. But it hasn't really been challenged in like

186
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,410
Speaker 6:  too many ways to really sort that out judiciously. So it

187
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,370
Speaker 6:  is kind of this weird, like haunting apparition above

188
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,330
Speaker 6:  the FCC. But you know, we're going to talk about this and then the

189
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,300
Speaker 6:  podcast is going to go up and then you're gonna have a ton of telecom lawyers.

190
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,910
Speaker 6:  And I mentioned being like, well, that's not actually what it is and blah,

191
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,150
Speaker 6:  blah, blah, but that's the world.

192
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,910
Speaker 1:  And then it's mentioned so like telecom lawyers and Starling

193
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,100
Speaker 1:  families. It's great when they get together.

194
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,890
Speaker 6:  I wish the guidance could have seen my visceral reaction when you mentioned

195
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,580
Speaker 6:  Starlink, because honestly I just wanted to scream. I could

196
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,250
Speaker 6:  feel it in my throat, all the mentions I get

197
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,480
Speaker 1:  Just to be clear for everyone, space X and Starlink have received

198
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,020
Speaker 1:  billions of dollars in subsidies already Starling

199
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,590
Speaker 1:  specifically and pretty controversially

200
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,910
Speaker 1:  Starlink applied for subsidies to provide service in like the parking lot

201
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,330
Speaker 1:  of Walmart stores and like other heavily populated

202
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,320
Speaker 1:  areas, which is maybe that maybe at the end of the day, Starlink is

203
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,070
Speaker 1:  just another ISP in the act like other ISP.

204
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,850
Speaker 1:  Like I appreciate that. People love them. I'm just saying if you're a broadband

205
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,690
Speaker 1:  company, my instinct is not to trust you. That's that's the way that

206
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:51,960
Speaker 1:  goes.

207
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,080
Speaker 6:  Speaking of Ilan too specifically, another interesting thing in the

208
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Speaker 6:  infrastructure bill is that there's a couple of billion

209
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,860
Speaker 1:  Dollars in it to build out a nationwide Evie charging

210
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,290
Speaker 1:  system. That was a great segue.

211
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,920
Speaker 6:  But yeah, so there's a nationwide Evie charging plan in there to

212
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,250
Speaker 6:  basically over the next couple of years, make sure that you can just like,

213
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,490
Speaker 6:  you would like go get your big gulp or whatever. When you like go fill up

214
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,760
Speaker 6:  with gas, you can basically do that with your EBT card too, which is kind

215
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,050
Speaker 6:  of cool to see that coming into play.

216
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,670
Speaker 1:  I have the same question here. $7.5 billion is maybe not enough

217
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,660
Speaker 1:  billion dollars, but it's some it's meaningful. I've talked to a lot

218
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,260
Speaker 1:  of car company CEOs on decoder. They're like, we're waiting for the government

219
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,890
Speaker 1:  to help us with charging. How does this, how are they going to pay electrify

220
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,770
Speaker 1:  America or are they going to pay the states? How does this money get allocated?

221
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,890
Speaker 6:  That's a really interesting thing. It's something that I think Andy would

222
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,610
Speaker 6:  be better well-suited to talk about, but I have, I have a feeling it's probably

223
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,450
Speaker 6:  the same kind of grant program. There's a problem with like handing out money

224
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,350
Speaker 6:  to states. And like this argument over federalism is very wonky

225
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,010
Speaker 6:  things with Republicans that they like trying to do grant

226
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,910
Speaker 6:  programs and things, but that's it, the goal is, you know, to do it

227
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,520
Speaker 6:  over the next couple of years. And I think what we can actually say for real

228
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,330
Speaker 6:  is like with the government backing this, I think having a

229
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,260
Speaker 6:  plan to do this over so many years, we actually incentivize other,

230
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,040
Speaker 6:  you know, car companies or infrastructure companies to follow suit. Right.

231
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,910
Speaker 6:  Invest more money on their own, seeing that this is already starting. Yeah.

232
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,080
Speaker 1:  I think the E V charging thing, every time we bring up another

233
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,410
Speaker 1:  Evie on the show when Andy or Sean are on the show, Shawn was on last week,

234
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,800
Speaker 1:  the feedback is that car looks great, but it doesn't have a supercharger

235
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,650
Speaker 1:  network. Right, right. And so like, I should buy a Tesla instead of whatever

236
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,400
Speaker 1:  new Eve, if this even goes a little bit of the way to making that market

237
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,910
Speaker 1:  more competitive. I think that's a good thing. I just, I'm kind of at the,

238
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,750
Speaker 1:  a lot of these companies are gonna try to get this money and actually holding

239
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,680
Speaker 1:  them accountable to using it for what it's for. I'm very central wealth

240
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,920
Speaker 1:  brought in companies historically, maybe less so with the EAP companies.

241
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,730
Speaker 1:  So I think at the end of the day, like GM and Ford will

242
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,570
Speaker 1:  know when their customers can't charge their cars and they can't, that's

243
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,440
Speaker 1:  not an acceptable outcome. Like thousands of dead electric

244
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,180
Speaker 1:  F-150 is on the highways of America is not an acceptable outcome for Ford.

245
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,580
Speaker 1:  Like I think they're, they're motivated to solve the problem, but

246
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,390
Speaker 1:  I'm very curious before we get CFC, what else is in this bill that's worth

247
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:13,780
Speaker 1:  thinking about,

248
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,830
Speaker 6:  That's kind of where we are with tech on that bill. Mostly the interesting

249
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,950
Speaker 6:  thing now is like we have to wait and see what happens with the other half

250
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,880
Speaker 6:  of the bill back better plan, which is more trillions of dollars for more

251
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,870
Speaker 6:  tech related things. So it's at this point now where we really don't

252
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,830
Speaker 6:  know when votes will happen in Congress, but what's in the BBB package right

253
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,950
Speaker 6:  now is some really fun stuff that I think our audience specifically will

254
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,910
Speaker 6:  be interested in specifically there's e-bike tax credits in there.

255
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,930
Speaker 6:  So you get like 30% tax credit through the IRS when you buy

256
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,890
Speaker 6:  like a, an eBike worth, like $1,500 or something,

257
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,080
Speaker 6:  which incentivizes more people to buy. Those

258
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,140
Speaker 3:  Is shocking me that the is hung on to the bill for this long I was expecting,

259
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,410
Speaker 3:  it would be one of the first things to get cut when they started, started

260
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,360
Speaker 3:  slicing things down. But it's still there,

261
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,140
Speaker 6:  Right? Yeah, no, I was surprised too. Cause I IDM somebody in a

262
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,470
Speaker 6:  senator's office and I was like, this was y'all's thing. Like, is it still

263
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,320
Speaker 6:  in there? And they're like, we're really scared, but we'll see that it was

264
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,790
Speaker 6:  so every white everyone was like, oh my God, this is so cool. And then also

265
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,450
Speaker 6:  something that I think is really important to talk about is this free laptop

266
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,440
Speaker 6:  program. That's in the BBB program as well. The infrastructure bill, like

267
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,130
Speaker 6:  we just talked about 65 billion to make sure families have in-home access

268
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,400
Speaker 6:  to high speed broadband. But what does that mean for families who don't have

269
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,120
Speaker 6:  devices at all? Right? So this program essentially

270
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,810
Speaker 6:  gives states and housing authorities, public

271
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,500
Speaker 6:  libraries, all these kinds of organizations, the ability to ask for

272
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,310
Speaker 6:  grant funding from the commerce department in order to make either

273
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,880
Speaker 6:  laptops, desktops, or tablets free

274
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,660
Speaker 6:  for people of lower income, they could also partner with

275
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,800
Speaker 6:  Microsoft maybe or some other company in order to do like a refurbish

276
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,760
Speaker 6:  lower cost device program. So that's really, really cool. And really

277
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,090
Speaker 6:  it comes down to, you can put all the money out there for broadband access,

278
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,020
Speaker 6:  but people still don't have the devices to even connect. You're really not

279
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,050
Speaker 6:  helping people all that much. So that'll be cool to see if it gets past

280
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,710
Speaker 1:  At the beginning of the pandemic McKinney, you've actually done a bunch of

281
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,160
Speaker 1:  stories with us pre pandemic during the pandemic, right? There's like the

282
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,970
Speaker 1:  homework gap for a lot of kids where they don't have access. And then

283
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,690
Speaker 1:  they, all they have is their schools, devices, which may or may not be

284
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,150
Speaker 1:  useful. So you connect broadband and you give people devices. That's that's

285
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,160
Speaker 1:  good. What's the status of that. Second bill is kind

286
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,090
Speaker 1:  of up in the air, right?

287
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,470
Speaker 6:  It is. So this is an interesting thing that happened before the house

288
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,890
Speaker 6:  left a couple of weeks ago. They there's this fight between

289
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,800
Speaker 6:  progressives who had long been promised. We're going to get these social

290
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,490
Speaker 6:  services programs in the BB, in the in Biden's infrastructure plan. We've

291
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,700
Speaker 6:  been promised this, we want the Medicare. We want things like that. And then

292
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,510
Speaker 6:  the bill got severed into, so Progressive's were like, well, we can

293
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,470
Speaker 6:  vote on Biff, but we bipartisan infrastructure bill, sorry, I should've just

294
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,770
Speaker 6:  like layered Twitter dragon. We should. When we vote on the infrastructure

295
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,430
Speaker 6:  bill, we need to vote on the BBB as well, the social spending program.

296
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,390
Speaker 6:  And I think it was close to 20 house Democrats refuse

297
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,380
Speaker 6:  to, they voted no on the infrastructure package. And so that infrastructure

298
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,310
Speaker 6:  package was narrowly very narrowly approved. So that BBB bill

299
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,910
Speaker 6:  and needs to be brought up in both the house and the Senate for a new

300
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,510
Speaker 6:  vote in order for it to pass. So the politics in the house of

301
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,350
Speaker 6:  course are a little shaky, but the politics in the Senate on that

302
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,250
Speaker 6:  is also a little shaky with Joe Manchin. Of course, who held

303
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,460
Speaker 6:  up the infrastructure package for a while and then Kirsten cinema

304
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,340
Speaker 6:  noted, Democrat net neutrality, hater,

305
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,980
Speaker 6:  the only Democrat who really opposes net neutrality. And so their votes are

306
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,250
Speaker 6:  really such a razor-thin majority in the Senate. They need those votes in

307
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,620
Speaker 6:  order to improve the BBB. And they're hoping to do this

308
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,430
Speaker 6:  Thanksgiving before December before something the timeline's not

309
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,390
Speaker 6:  entirely sure, just so

310
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,410
Speaker 1:  Just yet. I don't think I want to get too deep into the intro

311
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,220
Speaker 1:  Democrat politics of it all. There are many podcasts available for you to

312
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,150
Speaker 1:  listen to, if you want to really get deep into the weeds on democratic

313
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,960
Speaker 1:  party politics, but fundamentally, how do they decide,

314
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,950
Speaker 1:  okay, broadband goes in this bill, but laptops, let kids

315
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,710
Speaker 1:  use that. Broadband goes in this bill. It was there any rhyme or reason to

316
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,980
Speaker 1:  that?

317
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,450
Speaker 6:  The second half of the bill is being done through a process in the Senate

318
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,290
Speaker 6:  called reconciliation. So that has kind of changed a little bit of the

319
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,890
Speaker 6:  language, especially because they have to do it through reconciliation because

320
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,700
Speaker 6:  they only need a small majority rather than a super majority to

321
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,630
Speaker 6:  pass it, which requires those two democratic senators.

322
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,260
Speaker 6:  Right. In order for it to get approved with Biff, Biff,

323
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,920
Speaker 6:  Biff is called Biff because it's bipartisan, right. They had that super

324
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,730
Speaker 6:  majority, it was passed a lot of Republican support. And

325
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,660
Speaker 6:  for a long time, a lot of Republican senators, not just Democrats have been

326
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,410
Speaker 6:  calling for a universal broadband access, right? So that was easy to

327
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,310
Speaker 6:  secure in there. Maybe it wasn't as much money as Democrats had hoped, but

328
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,130
Speaker 6:  they were able to get it in there and secure it, bipartisan win for the Biden

329
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:02,610
Speaker 6:  administration.

330
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,900
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And we have long noted that giving people a faster internet

331
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,740
Speaker 1:  access is like across the aisle. Everyone wants it. Sometimes it's

332
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,190
Speaker 1:  the, it comes down to how will you deliver it is the disagreement, but, and

333
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,950
Speaker 1:  every member of Congress wants to go back to their district and be like,

334
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,150
Speaker 1:  you're an ass faster. And I did that and it's a pretty easy

335
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,050
Speaker 1:  win to deliver to people. Okay. Let's talk about the FCC because it

336
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,950
Speaker 1:  has come up in the context of broadband. So many times the FCC is in a moment

337
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,520
Speaker 1:  of extended drama in like many different

338
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,270
Speaker 1:  dimensions. So let's start with the simplest one that they did have a vote.

339
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,050
Speaker 1:  They might have a new chairperson soon who we know well, it's Jessica Rosenworcel,

340
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,570
Speaker 1:  we've, I've talked to her, you've talked to her, she's been on the show,

341
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,260
Speaker 1:  but then there's Gigi sewn, who we've also talked to a lot at the verge who

342
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,510
Speaker 1:  seemed as much more controversial breakdown what's going on there.

343
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,740
Speaker 6:  Right? So since the beginning of the Biden administration, a Jeep PI, the

344
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,280
Speaker 6:  former chair stepped away. And right now we're sitting at a two

345
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,090
Speaker 6:  to stalemate with two Republicans and two Democrats.

346
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,330
Speaker 6:  So they can't really do anything too controversial. They can't really do

347
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,230
Speaker 6:  anything that Democrats really want to do, whether that's passing net neutrality

348
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,160
Speaker 6:  or putting more broadband regulations in place because they just don't

349
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,150
Speaker 6:  have the votes to do it. So that's the way it's been for 11 months

350
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,080
Speaker 6:  now where they've just been kind of doing essentially like

351
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,860
Speaker 6:  administrative work spectrum work, basically just kind of like cleaning the

352
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,850
Speaker 6:  floors of like things, easy cooperatively, like things that just

353
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,630
Speaker 6:  need to get done. So they've been able to do that. And if, if for

354
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,260
Speaker 6:  so long, even over the summer, we're hearing rumors about who the next

355
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,380
Speaker 6:  FCC chair is going to be. Who's the next person who's going to be appointed.

356
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,310
Speaker 6:  And eventually it ended up being Jessica Rosenworcel who is serving as chair

357
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:45,000
Speaker 6:  now. And now we have Gigi stone who noted progressive supports net

358
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,550
Speaker 6:  neutrality supports like broader regulations for broadband at the

359
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,180
Speaker 6:  FCC used to work for Tom Wheeler as a general counsel during like the net

360
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,930
Speaker 6:  neutrality fight. Of course, like Obama's chairperson who pushed that through

361
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:59,440
Speaker 6:  in the end, everyone seems a little excited about Jessica Rosenworcel her

362
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,430
Speaker 6:  vote will be pretty easy to get through, but with GG, there's been this weird

363
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,970
Speaker 6:  fight that's crept up from

364
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,360
Speaker 6:  Murdoch owned businesses kind of, but I don't want to, you know, you can't

365
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,200
Speaker 6:  really say anything specifically, but Lindsey Graham, the wall street journal

366
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,220
Speaker 6:  Fox news, they're all saying that Gigi will work as a censor against

367
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,210
Speaker 6:  Republican speech on law. On, on the broad on airwaves, sorry, I've been

368
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,110
Speaker 6:  saying Republican speech online for years now, and this is migrating to the

369
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,950
Speaker 6:  airwaves now as so, which is essentially

370
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,820
Speaker 6:  Gigi has had some comments about like fairness over the

371
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,240
Speaker 6:  airwaves for a while. But over the last couple of years, she said that there's

372
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,960
Speaker 6:  no way that anything like that could happen again. So there's this weird

373
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,590
Speaker 6:  kind of fight. And I think that's also like explained through the fact that

374
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,800
Speaker 6:  like Newsmax and OAN noted

375
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,790
Speaker 6:  pro-Trump news organizations support her nomination.

376
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,690
Speaker 6:  So it's kind of in this weird moment where we basically know that we're

377
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,080
Speaker 6:  still going to have to too, but it's, there is no hearing for

378
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,830
Speaker 6:  Gigi. We have no idea what's really happening there and it's

379
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,610
Speaker 6:  questioned whether or not Democrats can get anything done really in Biden's

380
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,990
Speaker 6:  first year, first two years.

381
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,520
Speaker 3:  Can you explain why Newsmax and Owen would

382
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,480
Speaker 3:  be supporting GG sound? Because if there's any group that I would

383
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,470
Speaker 3:  assume would say that, you know, center and are being censored and

384
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,250
Speaker 3:  we must stop it, it would be those outlets. So I'm confused.

385
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,060
Speaker 6:  So I think it's interesting to note that like Gigi has been doing this for

386
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,990
Speaker 6:  like 30 years. She is a well beloved

387
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,470
Speaker 6:  person in the telecom community, amongst Republicans and

388
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,460
Speaker 6:  Democrats, every source I ha I talked to is like Gigi rules. She

389
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,330
Speaker 6:  will listen to you. And she has, when she talks about free speech, she

390
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,900
Speaker 6:  really means it and all this kind of stuff. And the people who worked at

391
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,500
Speaker 6:  Newsmax and OAN who offered these op-eds, you know, last week have worked

392
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,010
Speaker 6:  with Gigi and know what she, you know, what she stands for.

393
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,660
Speaker 6:  So they, they know that Gigi will support them, maybe not support,

394
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,410
Speaker 6:  right. But give them the opportunity, right. To continue to work the way

395
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,920
Speaker 6:  that they do. It's the interesting thing where it's coming from more, it

396
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,310
Speaker 6:  was a wall street journal op ed page that, that had the first thing about

397
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,850
Speaker 6:  GG. And then of course, Fox news, and then more conservative

398
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,180
Speaker 6:  Republicans who are raising the question about the censorship thing, which

399
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,960
Speaker 6:  feels kind of like a made up argument because it's not something anyone has

400
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,740
Speaker 6:  really raised against Gigi in the past at

401
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,160
Speaker 6:  all.

402
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,390
Speaker 1:  Yeah. This is my favorite, like mini drama going on

403
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,290
Speaker 1:  right now because Fox news versus Newsmax, if

404
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,010
Speaker 1:  you abstract away the fact that they're both conservative cable networks,

405
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:40,180
Speaker 1:  where you have as a gigantic monopoly position and an upstart

406
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,020
Speaker 1:  competitor and Gigi is aligned with the competitors and then the

407
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,660
Speaker 1:  gigantic monopolies dislike that. And then the other thing you have,

408
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,710
Speaker 1:  which is like more broadly, you have the cable networks,

409
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,370
Speaker 1:  which have to like run Owen and Newsmax and all those other

410
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,300
Speaker 1:  channels. So they have worked with Gigi on the business side to get access

411
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,110
Speaker 1:  to Comcast and spectrum and whoever else, disclosure,

412
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,890
Speaker 1:  Comcast and investor me, the parent company. I assure you, this has not

413
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,880
Speaker 1:  influenced our coverage at all. So ages ago, Gigi organized a

414
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,480
Speaker 1:  coalition of like independent cable networks to demand

415
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,470
Speaker 1:  access to cable companies and Fox posts that she organized the

416
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,950
Speaker 1:  conservative outlets to oppose when Tribune was trying to buy

417
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,670
Speaker 1:  Sinclair, which was the huge, broad, conservative broadcast network. She

418
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,060
Speaker 1:  organized a concern like small conservative outlets to pose that merger.

419
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,870
Speaker 1:  So just like broadly, she's on the side of big things, shouldn't get bigger.

420
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,530
Speaker 1:  And so all these small networks have worked with her to oppose big things

421
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,400
Speaker 1:  that ain't bigger. So I agree. I think there's that. And then there's also

422
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,690
Speaker 1:  like 18 T in Comcast in variety. Like they spent a ton

423
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,080
Speaker 1:  of lobbying money for a lot, for just across the board,

424
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,520
Speaker 1:  like pick a Senator there's money flowing in from the telcos and

425
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,420
Speaker 1:  Gigi wants to regulate them harder. So like across the board, I think

426
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,270
Speaker 1:  there's just a lot of opposition here. But if you look at the breakdown,

427
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,470
Speaker 1:  Fox news versus OAN comes down to Owen's business is

428
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,430
Speaker 1:  threatened by monopolies, both in broadcasting, in cable,

429
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:11,240
Speaker 1:  and then eventually for access. And anytime you try to regulate those

430
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,660
Speaker 1:  monopolies, people say it's censorship. And I think this is just hilarious,

431
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,410
Speaker 1:  right? Like you live by at and T is lobbying money. You kind of like you

432
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:22,220
Speaker 1:  die by these love England. Like Owen runs on direct TV.

433
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,360
Speaker 1:  There's all those stories about how at and T is like funds. OEN T is

434
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,020
Speaker 1:  lobbying. Money is preventing the, the person that Owen wants from,

435
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,410
Speaker 1:  from getting on the STC. I think it's just like utterly fascinating to see

436
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,400
Speaker 1:  that split in inside of conservative media play out in the

437
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,350
Speaker 1:  face of it is a progressive FCC commissioner. And I, I

438
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,090
Speaker 1:  don't know. I just find this. I could talk to us all day. Like it's very,

439
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,690
Speaker 1:  it's a very small beltway politics, but it's, I think its

440
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,230
Speaker 1:  symptoms something much bigger. Do you think she's going to get through McKenna?

441
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I do. I think there's always horse trading done.

442
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,900
Speaker 6:  That's kind of what everyone says on the hill. When it come to

443
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:02,840
Speaker 6:  nominations, they get voted on the same time that they do another

444
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,560
Speaker 6:  bill or, you know, senators make some deal to get one nomination

445
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,310
Speaker 6:  in for getting like something else. So I think something will break eventually.

446
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,540
Speaker 6:  It just depends on when,

447
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,140
Speaker 1:  But there's like a, there's like a deadline here. Right? If they don't get

448
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,830
Speaker 1:  Rosenworcel in his chair, they don't get sewn in, in time. This two to

449
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,210
Speaker 1:  deadlock persists for quite awhile.

450
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,100
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And Rosenworcel would have to pick up her office and leave. They don't

451
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,400
Speaker 6:  vote on to reconfirm her by the end of the year, which would be a one, two

452
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,560
Speaker 6:  would, was Republicans in the majority.

453
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,660
Speaker 6:  So that's what wasting all of this time, as broad as

454
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,990
Speaker 6:  to the kind of intense over there at the house of

455
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,740
Speaker 6:  lawyers,

456
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,910
Speaker 1:  It's like just a bunch of gray suits yelling. No, that's honestly, the sec

457
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,630
Speaker 1:  has been like, I feel like the Trump administration was notable in

458
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,350
Speaker 1:  that. Right? Maybe they never got infrastructure done, but

459
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,890
Speaker 1:  they confirmed a lot of appointments. They confirmed a lot of judges. They

460
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,040
Speaker 1:  moved really fast on this stuff. Why is the Biden administration been so

461
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,400
Speaker 1:  slow?

462
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,510
Speaker 6:  It's a good question. I think it has a lot to do with how the Senate will

463
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,220
Speaker 6:  confirm them. Right? When you have more controversial people like this, the

464
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,190
Speaker 6:  fun thing to note is like, there's like three really progressive people

465
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,220
Speaker 6:  in Biden's cabinet. Right now there is Lena Khan who we've talked about a

466
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,180
Speaker 6:  lot and she had bipartisan support because we've seen this like bipartisan

467
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:22,170
Speaker 6:  outcry over like tech regulation and like enforcement over monopoly

468
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,830
Speaker 6:  power at the FTC. And then the same thing with Johnathan Cantor, Jonathan

469
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,500
Speaker 6:  Kantor was approved earlier this week to lead the

470
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,920
Speaker 6:  antitrust division at the DOJ. And so there's those two

471
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,910
Speaker 6:  Progressive's right. But when it comes to Telekom and Gigi, it's funny that

472
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:39,210
Speaker 6:  that's like the one progressive who's having like that much of an issue.

473
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,110
Speaker 6:  And I think it really does come down to write this like huge history

474
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:47,280
Speaker 6:  of telecom money and things like that. And of course like at the

475
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,210
Speaker 6:  Senate cursing cinema is one of the deciding votes when she

476
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,180
Speaker 6:  gets brought to a house floor, right. To see if she even gets confirmed so

477
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,510
Speaker 6:  that you either need like more Republicans on board or to ensure that these

478
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,840
Speaker 6:  two Democrats mansion cinema will vote to approve her.

479
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,910
Speaker 1:  And I'll do it. Put me in coach.

480
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,700
Speaker 1:  I'll do it. I'll just put me in I'll I'll run the FCC. That'd be, I don't

481
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,910
Speaker 1:  think I'd get better for it, but I'll do it, Joe, if you're listening, you

482
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,510
Speaker 1:  got my number. Yes. He doesn't have enough. He could probably get it last

483
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,720
Speaker 1:  one. Biden's pick somebody to run the FDA and

484
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,500
Speaker 6:  They work at Google.

485
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,220
Speaker 1:  This is a very, it's very funny for a million reasons. But first tell us

486
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,970
Speaker 1:  who this person is.

487
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:28,290
Speaker 6:  This is Robert Kayla. If I'm assuming, and he's going to run, you know, the

488
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,100
Speaker 6:  FDA that was announced earlier this week, right now, he's like a

489
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,610
Speaker 6:  senior advisor for verily health sciences, but

490
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,180
Speaker 6:  sciences, sorry. And then like Google health, which is kind of

491
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,840
Speaker 6:  interesting. But of course, like it's good to note that the Obama

492
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,740
Speaker 6:  administration, that Joe Biden was a part of had a lot of

493
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,430
Speaker 6:  like tech people and a lot of people who left the Obama administration to

494
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,420
Speaker 6:  go work in tech. There is this like big atmosphere of like tech people

495
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,810
Speaker 6:  in the Obama circle. So we've seen a lot of tech people kind of move

496
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,800
Speaker 6:  into the, you know, the Biden office as well. And so

497
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,070
Speaker 6:  it's kind of interesting to see it. There's been a lot of pushback on having

498
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,980
Speaker 6:  like tech people in the cabinet. So it's interesting that this one kind of

499
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,460
Speaker 6:  like cracked.

500
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,150
Speaker 1:  I just had to say this Google never made the website. Don't hire the person

501
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,390
Speaker 1:  from Google. They're supposed to make a website that was supposed to test.

502
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,500
Speaker 1:  They just never did it. All right. I put it, it was only out here so I can

503
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,280
Speaker 1:  make the website check, but kind of what should we be looking for next we're

504
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,000
Speaker 1:  cruising into Thanksgiving and then holidays. When do you, when should people

505
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,420
Speaker 1:  be on the lookout for this next set of votes around Rosenworcel and around

506
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,260
Speaker 1:  build by better?

507
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,070
Speaker 6:  Ah, man. So bill back better, who knows?

508
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,090
Speaker 6:  We've gotten to this point where it could be tomorrow. It could be a month

509
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,090
Speaker 6:  from now. Honestly, it just depends when this gets said, decided when it

510
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,870
Speaker 6:  comes to Rosenworcel, the Senate never does

511
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,770
Speaker 6:  anything like one at a time, they always have like one day

512
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,700
Speaker 6:  where they decide to take a vote on like literally everything. So I'm sure

513
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,890
Speaker 6:  like she'll get voted around the same time that they end up like funding

514
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,180
Speaker 6:  the government, which is still a thing that they have not done yet. And the

515
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,140
Speaker 6:  government could shut down next month. Again, everyone we

516
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,380
Speaker 6:  are in shambles. I don't know how the system continues to work, but yeah.

517
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,340
Speaker 6:  So hopefully by the end of the year more broadly and then look

518
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,030
Speaker 6:  at it when other big projects like the defense authorization and other big

519
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,070
Speaker 6:  funding bills get pushed through who the end of the year.

520
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,860
Speaker 1:  All right, man, it's always a pleasure to have you on we'll have you back

521
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,980
Speaker 1:  when all this stuff gets passed to figure out where all this money is going,

522
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,610
Speaker 1:  who's going to spend it.

523
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,320
Speaker 6:  Great. Talk to you later, guys.

524
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,290
Speaker 7:  We're all used to shopping around for the best prices on airfare, groceries,

525
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:39,160
Speaker 7:  gas, basically everything we buy really, but almost none of us do

526
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,670
Speaker 7:  that for our prescriptions. If you're ready to start saving money on your

527

Speaker 7:  retail prices.

540
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,990
Speaker 2:  When it comes to your finances, wouldn't it be nice to have a little extra

541
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,860
Speaker 2:  help, like an intelligent assistant to point out when a free trial is about

542
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,730
Speaker 2:  to end or alert you to suspicious charges, capital

558
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,260
Speaker 1:  Lauren Grosh welcome and very fast.

559
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,360
Speaker 8:  So excited to be back.

560
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,990
Speaker 1:  If you don't know, Lauren was off on book leave, we're excited to read Lawrenceburg

561
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,540
Speaker 1:  when it comes out. We can't plug it yet because it's not out. So we got to

562
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,900
Speaker 1:  wait, but it's been months since we've talked to Lauren and months and she's

563
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,200
Speaker 1:  been on the show. So welcome back. And it's a good day to come back because

564
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,480
Speaker 1:  the space wars have begun.

565
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,340
Speaker 8:  They haven't been done, but they are closer

566
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,130
Speaker 8:  and they are having, we were getting some issues. Yes.

567
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,380
Speaker 1:  All right. So I'm just reading this headline. Russia blows up a satellite

568
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,280
Speaker 1:  comma, creating dangerous debris cloud in space. Is this a James Bond movie?

569
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,420
Speaker 1:  I just want to take both parts of that headline interns.

570
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,930
Speaker 1:  Let's start with Russia blows up the satellite. Why did Russia blow up a

571
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,320
Speaker 1:  satellite?

572
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,940
Speaker 8:  What Russia did is known as an anti satellite test or

573
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,840
Speaker 8:  an ASAP test and what these are

574
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,620
Speaker 8:  our basic political shows of strength to say that,

575
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,490
Speaker 8:  Hey, I have this capability of blowing up a

576
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,330
Speaker 8:  satellite that's in orbit around earth. And it's

577
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,080
Speaker 8:  actually a pretty hard thing to do. Remember that satellites that are, or

578
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,160
Speaker 8:  earth orbit are moving at roughly 17,500

579
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,060
Speaker 8:  miles per hour. And so being able to pinpoint exactly where

580
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,870
Speaker 8:  it's going to be and then send a missile to that. Satellite is a

581
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,050
Speaker 8:  pretty complicated technical

582
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,040
Speaker 8:  capability. And so Russia was basically showing off saying, Hey,

583
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,670
Speaker 8:  look, we took out one of our satellites. We could potentially do that with

584
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,570
Speaker 8:  one of yours. If you, you know, down the line, they, they didn't say

585
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,500
Speaker 8:  that outright, but that is what they are implying by doing this.

586
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,220
Speaker 1:  So they fired myself from earth and hit one of their own satellites in space,

587
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,270
Speaker 1:  which is very complicated. And obviously right, the, the signal is

588
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,660
Speaker 1:  we could potentially do it to yours. Aren't there like rules that say we're

589
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,670
Speaker 1:  not supposed to do that.

590
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,930
Speaker 8:  So that has been a big point of discussion. After this

591
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:39,890
Speaker 8:  test happen, we do have a treaty it's called the outer space

592
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:43,850
Speaker 8:  treaty. It's my favorite treaty, basically

593
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:47,330
Speaker 8:  loose guidelines of how we're supposed to explore space.

594
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,350
Speaker 8:  And you know, it's, we want to explore space peacefully. Don't

595
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:55,070
Speaker 8:  put nukes in orbit, kind of basic things like that.

596
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,060
Speaker 8:  It's essentially it's written vague on purpose so

597
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,900
Speaker 8:  that we have options when it comes to exploring space. They

598
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,770
Speaker 8:  didn't, they didn't want it to be very restrictive and, and telling exact

599
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,730
Speaker 8:  countries exactly what they could do in orbit. Also there

600
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,630
Speaker 8:  hasn't been a desire to outright ban ASAP tests because you know,

601
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,140
Speaker 8:  the U S did an ASAP test itself back in

602
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,740
Speaker 8:  2008. So I'm sure that discussion will be

603
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,640
Speaker 8:  revived. And I mean, it's already being revived right now that the

604
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,020
Speaker 8:  Russians did this, but yeah, it's, it's not outright banned.

605
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,860
Speaker 8:  We do have guidelines for how we're supposed to behave in

606
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,520
Speaker 8:  space. They're all very much open to interpretation,

607
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,790
Speaker 8:  but it's yeah, there is no, there is no treaty that says, do

608
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,270
Speaker 8:  not perform anti-satellite tests in

609
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,720
Speaker 1:  That seems like a, an oversight, but there's a reason you'd want to

610
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,680
Speaker 1:  do it. Right. I mean, a large chunk of our communications infrastructure

611
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,700
Speaker 1:  runs through space. Like if you were to go to a war, you would

612
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,560
Speaker 1:  probably want to do this.

613
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:03,000
Speaker 8:  I mean, there are plenty of discussions about what a war in space

614
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,570
Speaker 8:  with look like and not necessarily destroying a

615
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,440
Speaker 8:  satellite with a kinetic missile because of the impact it has,

616
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,430
Speaker 8:  but you know, jamming satellites, you know, taking out a satellite

617
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,390
Speaker 8:  either physically or with software is definitely

618
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,140
Speaker 8:  what I think a future space battle would entail

619
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,040
Speaker 8:  because I think a lot of people don't realize just how reliant we are on

620
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,100
Speaker 8:  our satellite infrastructure. You know, we are a space

621
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,270
Speaker 8:  nation in a way. We, our phones rely on GPS. You know, we

622
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,380
Speaker 8:  take a lot of earth imagery with our satellites.

623
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,400
Speaker 8:  A lot of surveillance satellites are very much necessary for

624
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,030
Speaker 8:  our military apparatus. So yeah, I think

625
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,900
Speaker 8:  taking out satellites in some form would definitely be a

626
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,570
Speaker 8:  way that you would do battle in space.

627
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,930
Speaker 1:  And then the other thing before we get to the debris cloud, which seems like

628
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,590
Speaker 1:  its own complicated problem, I don't know, just for like a

629
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,890
Speaker 1:  while there, it seemed like the United States and Russia for all their other

630
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,580
Speaker 1:  problems were pretty agreeable with space, right? The

631
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,330
Speaker 1:  international space station exists. We needed their rockets to go there.

632
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,230
Speaker 1:  That appears to have changed. Is that me just over reading the fact that

633
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,070
Speaker 1:  they blew up a satellite

634
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,210
Speaker 8:  Very interesting position that we are in, because

635
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,420
Speaker 8:  what seems to be happening is a

636
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,020
Speaker 8:  delineation between the Russian military and rose

637
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,590
Speaker 8:  cosmos the space agency or

638
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,970
Speaker 8:  a space corporation. And what it is is we have a good

639
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,510
Speaker 8:  relationship with Roscosmos. Sometimes it can be a little

640
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,680
Speaker 8:  iffy, but overall we have a great foundation

641
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,890
Speaker 8:  to work with them. They are our biggest partners on the international space

642
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:47,310
Speaker 8:  station. And so NASA is working with them frequently.

643
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,300
Speaker 8:  The NASA administrator seems to, he indicated

644
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,840
Speaker 8:  that it's possible Roscosmos did not know about this

645
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,680
Speaker 8:  test so that the military did it not

646
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,980
Speaker 8:  knowing that it would potentially jeopardize

647
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,760
Speaker 8:  their cosmonauts on board, the international space station, which we can

648
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,360
Speaker 8:  get into shortly. We haven't had a lot of

649
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:12,810
Speaker 8:  details and the Russian military put out a very spicy

650
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,010
Speaker 8:  statement after it happened. That was like, oh, the U S

651
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,940
Speaker 8:  knows very well that this was not a danger, that this

652
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,840
Speaker 8:  was not a problem, which is just a wild statement to make, but

653
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,470
Speaker 8:  that is part of the Russia playbook. So it's not necessarily on surprising.

654
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,010
Speaker 1:  Okay. And then I have to ask you this question, I'm just going to tell the

655
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,220
Speaker 1:  audience, I'm going to ask this question and then you need to imagine Lauren's

656
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,920
Speaker 1:  her eyes as hard as she can. We have a space force.

657
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,610
Speaker 1:  There's patches, there's uniforms, they

658
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,810
Speaker 1:  got uniforms are called guardians. The whole situation is this

659
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:53,650
Speaker 1:  what our space force is designed to do. Okay. Just

660
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,070
Speaker 1:  checking.

661
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,260
Speaker 8:  I mean, okay. There is, we have something called the us

662
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,010
Speaker 8:  space command and that is responsible for

663
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:07,000
Speaker 8:  overseeing the tracking of debris and objects in

664
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,750
Speaker 8:  space. And so it was actually the responsibility of US-based command

665
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,500
Speaker 8:  to track the objects that were created from

666
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,770
Speaker 8:  this ASAP test, which they said it was about

667
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,460
Speaker 8:  1500 trackable objects and then

668
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,480
Speaker 8:  thousands of small objects that we cannot track. And that's the

669
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,380
Speaker 8:  scary part, right? Because we have great tracking capability, but we just

670
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,220
Speaker 8:  can't see everything, especially if it's small. So that's, what's so

671
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,700
Speaker 8:  scary about it. The space force is mostly

672
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,210
Speaker 8:  tasked with operating and deploying those

673
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:44,050
Speaker 8:  satellites that we talked about. They oversee our

674
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,980
Speaker 8:  space assets in orbit. There has been discussion

675
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,580
Speaker 8:  about, you know, sending people into space for space for us, but

676
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,450
Speaker 8:  for now,

677
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,360
Speaker 1:  Could you hear the eye roll? Because I saw the,

678
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,850
Speaker 8:  Well, you have to understand is the U S military has had

679
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:04,570
Speaker 8:  a large stake in space and satellites and the

680
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:08,440
Speaker 8:  satellite infrastructure for a very long time. And what space force has

681
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,010
Speaker 8:  done is essentially put all those people that operate those

682
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,160
Speaker 8:  assets into their own branch or

683
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,360
Speaker 8:  yeah. And so it's really a bureaucratic and boring

684
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,140
Speaker 8:  change, but it did get a lot of attention because you know, it was

685
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,260
Speaker 8:  Trump's pet project and it has a very

686
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,900
Speaker 8:  provocative name. If you will,

687
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,340
Speaker 1:  Outer space treaty space for us, it's a good name. Okay. Let's talk about

688
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,640
Speaker 1:  the debris clouds. So they blew out the satellite. You said, there's stuff.

689
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,630
Speaker 1:  We could track 1500 things. We tracked stuff. We can't track. It seems like

690
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,710
Speaker 1:  the astronauts and the ISS didn't know this was going to happen. How did

691
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,250
Speaker 1:  this all play out?

692
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:49,300
Speaker 8:  Let me walk you through my Monday, because for us,

693
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,230
Speaker 8:  it was very crazy. So we started the day

694
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,100
Speaker 8:  with reports that there had been this ASAP test from Russia.

695
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,420
Speaker 8:  Wasn't confirmed the state department hadn't confirmed it yet. No one

696
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,230
Speaker 8:  from the U S was confirming it yet. And then at the same time, we

697
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:09,160
Speaker 8:  had these other reports that the astronauts on board, the

698
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,820
Speaker 8:  international space station had to shelter in place that morning

699
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,750
Speaker 8:  because of a D a cloud of debris that kept passing by the space station

700
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,650
Speaker 8:  every 90 minutes, which is how long it takes the space station to

701
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:25,000
Speaker 8:  orbit the earth. And so obviously we try, we put two

702
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,900
Speaker 8:  and two together. Okay. It seems like this Faiza test

703
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,860
Speaker 8:  probably created this cloud of debris that caused the

704
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:36,620
Speaker 8:  astronauts to go into the safety mode. But we didn't know that for

705
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,490
Speaker 8:  sure. Yeah.

706
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,330
Speaker 3:  My question is like, you don't, you don't know that for sure. But like, do

707
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,310
Speaker 3:  you, you know, you just don't want to say it or is it like, actually there's

708
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,700
Speaker 3:  like clouds of debris often enough, or like this could be just a wacky

709
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,450
Speaker 3:  coinkydink.

710
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,010
Speaker 8:  Well, when it comes to space journalism, I

711
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,740
Speaker 8:  never want to assume

712
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,870
Speaker 3:  I'm an author now, Dieter, the standards are higher. She does, she doesn't

713
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,040
Speaker 3:  want a space force, the issue

714
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,960
Speaker 8:  I assume. And obviously in our minds it did make

715
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,620
Speaker 8:  sense. And then what helps was we have, I have this great

716
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,250
Speaker 8:  source, a satellite tracker named Jonathan McDowell. He's like the

717
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,210
Speaker 8:  go-to guy when it comes to tracking debris

718
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:21,140
Speaker 8:  or satellites of any kind in orbit. And so he came online and then

719
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,890
Speaker 8:  he did all of these calculations and he basically showed that

720
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,000
Speaker 8:  the suspected satellite that we thought Russia had

721
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,630
Speaker 8:  blown up tracked with the ISS, it was

722
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,410
Speaker 8:  coming like it cross paths with the ISS about the

723
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:40,130
Speaker 8:  same time, every like the mission control kept telling

724
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:44,420
Speaker 8:  the astronauts of debris cloud was passing. So at that point it was

725
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,930
Speaker 8:  like, okay, this is absolutely happening because of the A's

726
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,890
Speaker 8:  test, but we still needed, you know, the U S to confirm that we

727
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:55,250
Speaker 8:  needed NASA to confirm that and getting those statements was actually pretty

728
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,310
Speaker 8:  difficult throughout the day. And I get it. It's a matter of national security.

729
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:02,240
Speaker 8:  It has a big geopolitical ramifications. So I

730
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,270
Speaker 8:  understood why it took them a while, but it was kind of frustrating because

731
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:09,200
Speaker 8:  we knew that this was a direct correlation, but we couldn't say for

732
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:09,590
Speaker 8:  sure.

733
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:13,340
Speaker 3:  So when you say passing by, was it close? Was it dangerously

734
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,100
Speaker 3:  close? Was it NASA being overcautious?

735
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,390
Speaker 8:  As I understand it, the satellite that they shot down was

736
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,020
Speaker 8:  about roughly a hundred kilometers. I want to say above the international

737
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,230
Speaker 8:  space station. But what happens when you do these ASAP tests

738
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:31,280
Speaker 8:  is like I said, it creates these thousands of pieces of debris and they don't

739
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,700
Speaker 8:  just stay in one spot, right? It's an explosive event. So

740
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,240
Speaker 8:  they go to higher altitudes, they go to lower

741
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,020
Speaker 8:  altitudes. They span like miles

742
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,650
Speaker 8:  along the orbital track of where the original

743
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,640
Speaker 8:  satellite was. So the way I described as a, somebody I thought was a pretty

744
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,300
Speaker 8:  good analogy was, imagine if you crash into a

745
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,960
Speaker 8:  car and it created all these car pieces, but those

746
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,860
Speaker 8:  pieces continued to drive down the highway

747
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:06,380
Speaker 8:  and you couldn't move them. They were just speeding along and you couldn't

748
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,340
Speaker 8:  stop them or maneuver it. And you just have to maneuver around them forever

749
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,330
Speaker 8:  because they're going to be, they're going to stay on the highway for years

750
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:18,440
Speaker 3:  So that they're not going to decay and fall into orbit and burn up. It's

751
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,190
Speaker 3:  going to be a long time.

752
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,600
Speaker 8:  Well, but it takes years for that to happen for our, our

753
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,500
Speaker 8:  atmosphere and gravity to pull them down. So what you have

754
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,500
Speaker 8:  this situation where they're going to be kind of raining down,

755
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,470
Speaker 8:  crossing paths with the international space station for years to come. So

756
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:38,400
Speaker 8:  it's, it's a significant problem that I'm pretty sure NASA

757
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,250
Speaker 8:  is going to have to be monitoring for a very long time.

758
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,300
Speaker 3:  Now you mentioned space command and that they could track the larger objects,

759
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,260
Speaker 3:  but the smaller objects for the scarier ones. So if we've got smaller objects

760
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,040
Speaker 3:  that can't be tracked around for a long time, I mean,

761
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,820
Speaker 3:  you know, I think everyone knows like the nightmare scenario is like, there's

762
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,030
Speaker 3:  so much space junk up there. Anything that goes into orbit, just get smashed

763
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,840
Speaker 3:  to bits by random space junk. Like, is this like

764
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,590
Speaker 3:  the first step towards that path of like, well, I guess we don't get to put

765
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,400
Speaker 3:  stuff in order to anymore, like how, how nerve wracked are. Do people

766
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,250
Speaker 3:  seem about the fact that there's a bunch of, you know, new space junk. They

767
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:14,850
Speaker 3:  can't track,

768
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,720
Speaker 8:  Oh, everyone, everyone in the space community is outraged over it. They've

769
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,410
Speaker 8:  all condemned it, you know, and there's some debate over

770
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,280
Speaker 8:  whether or not that exact scenario you painted will happen.

771
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,420
Speaker 8:  It may not be this thing where if you, if you launch into orbit, something's

772
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,310
Speaker 8:  going to immediately like smack you in your face. You know, it's, it's

773
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,280
Speaker 8:  more of, there is so much congestion up there that

774
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,270
Speaker 8:  you don't necessarily have a clear path, or you don't

775
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,110
Speaker 8:  necessarily know where all this stuff is. That's, that's another

776
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,860
Speaker 8:  big point of concern is we have all these tracking devices to

777
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,210
Speaker 8:  determine where space junk is, but we have differences

778
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,900
Speaker 8:  of opinion over where those things are. And those differences of opinion

779
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,800
Speaker 8:  can be a few miles in, you know, not knowing where they are. So

780
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:06,030
Speaker 8:  you could have one satellite and the us military

781
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,900
Speaker 8:  will say, oh, it's here. And then you have Leo labs, which

782
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,650
Speaker 8:  is a private space company tracker. And they say, actually, we see it, you

783
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,520
Speaker 8:  know, two miles this way. And so when you have that uncertainty factor

784
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,330
Speaker 8:  combined with the fact that it's getting more congested, then

785
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:24,990
Speaker 8:  you don't necessarily know if you launching your

786
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:29,160
Speaker 8:  satellite is going to be safe. If, if you don't know exactly where

787
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,880
Speaker 8:  everything is and everything's kind of all, you know, crowding that

788
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,570
Speaker 8:  environment just becomes harder to actually put things into orbit.

789
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,680
Speaker 8:  So it's less of a scenario where you have like gravity or things are

790
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,250
Speaker 8:  just constantly like destroying all of your, your

791
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:48,210
Speaker 8:  infrastructure. It's more of just, is it safe to put my satellite

792
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,360
Speaker 8:  in orbit? That question becomes more and more of a concern.

793
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,990
Speaker 1:  What about Russia? I mean, it, Russia also operates the international space

794
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:58,860
Speaker 1:  station. They've got cosmonauts. They're like, don't, shouldn't this bother

795
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,190
Speaker 1:  them.

796
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,030
Speaker 8:  Yeah. That was the whole, that's the irony of the

797
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:06,660
Speaker 8:  situation. I mean, when we found out that they had done this and that they

798
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,380
Speaker 8:  had potentially jeopardize the safety, they have there's two cosmonauts on

799
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,010
Speaker 8:  the international space station right now. So it was definitely

800
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:17,550
Speaker 8:  very strange. But if you look at the

801
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:21,540
Speaker 8:  history of the Russian space program, you know, they, they were

802
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,020
Speaker 8:  never that concerned about putting their cosmonauts in

803
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,680
Speaker 8:  harm's way. So I guess it's not

804
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:33,340
Speaker 8:  surprising, but it does feel a bit

805
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,570
Speaker 8:  counterintuitive,

806
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:40,420
Speaker 8:  but then you have Ross cosmos that comes out and they say, you know, safety

807
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:44,200
Speaker 8:  is our number one priority. So like I said, it is possible

808
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,650
Speaker 8:  that there was a miscommunication between the space

809
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,980
Speaker 8:  program and the military side of things.

810
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:54,760
Speaker 8:  But it does seem very strange that they would potentially

811
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,980
Speaker 8:  cause them nuts at risk.

812
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,910
Speaker 1:  Let's talk about some other space stuff. NASA announced a bunch of

813
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,450
Speaker 1:  changes to the lunar program. A delay

814
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,250
Speaker 1:  blue origin is mad as usual. It seems to be their permanent state

815
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:13,060
Speaker 1:  of being what what's going on with the moon. Is it still there?

816
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,290
Speaker 1:  Is it the tide still being driven by it as well? I like having you on the

817
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:21,190
Speaker 1:  show because you get to toss out these questions like a blood moon

818
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,380
Speaker 1:  soon. Right? Is moon cool? What's up with the moon?

819
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,250
Speaker 8:  Yeah. There's a lunar eclipse coming up. Wait witnesses

820
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:27,670
Speaker 8:  there,

821
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:28,600
Speaker 1:  My feet

822
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,860
Speaker 8:  Tomorrow. Okay. So it'll happen by the time this aired. So hopefully you

823
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,820
Speaker 8:  went out last night and looked at. Yeah. So what

824
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:40,810
Speaker 8:  I think DLI is referring to is the fact that NASA wants to send

825
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:44,080
Speaker 8:  people back to the moon with its Artimus program.

826
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:48,040
Speaker 8:  And they recently announced that their ambitious

827
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,000
Speaker 8:  target date, which was 20, 24, is not going to happen as

828
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,630
Speaker 8:  we all suspected. And they've moved the target date

829
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:59,260
Speaker 8:  to 20, 25 instead, which doesn't seem

830
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,240
Speaker 8:  nearly, it doesn't seem any more,

831
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:07,090
Speaker 8:  but you know, what can you do? It's good to have a bold deadline,

832
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:07,570
Speaker 8:  right?

833
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:13,000
Speaker 8:  You have your aspirational deadline, and then you have your real deadline.

834
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,480
Speaker 8:  And so

835
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,280
Speaker 1:  What do you think the real deadline is? Oh,

836
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:18,370
Speaker 8:  Gosh, we've all placed our bets on this, but I will not reveal my cards on

837
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,620
Speaker 8:  this. Cause I have my internal date.

838
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,610
Speaker 1:  I bet you it's the same year that they put a touch screen on the Mac. They

839
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:28,330
Speaker 1:  see, oh no, I hate it. And then blue origin is

840
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,940
Speaker 1:  suing the government because they didn't get the contract to build the slander.

841
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,180
Speaker 1:  Right.

842
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,140
Speaker 8:  Actually that lawsuit has now come to an end. The

843
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,890
Speaker 8:  judge overseeing the case, ruled against them.

844
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,850
Speaker 8:  And so now their litigation has ended. And actually

845
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,690
Speaker 8:  the judge just released his opinion, which was very

846
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:50,470
Speaker 8:  spicy and very in the weeds. And we can definitely get

847
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:53,530
Speaker 8:  into it if you want. Essentially,

848
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,250
Speaker 8:  Jeff Bezos came out and said that they were going to accept the ruling.

849
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:01,090
Speaker 8:  And so it sounds like they won't be protesting or

850
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:04,960
Speaker 8:  appealing the results anymore. And so now space

851
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,290
Speaker 8:  X is the sole provider for NASA's

852
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:12,280
Speaker 8:  human lunar Lander. And they have a long road ahead of them, but

853
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,710
Speaker 8:  I am very eager to see how,

854
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,820
Speaker 1:  And then Ilan has just been like wild and on Twitter and all kinds of ways

855
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:22,750
Speaker 1:  lately. And he got it, but he got to dunk on Bezos, which is like

856
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,830
Speaker 1:  all he cares about in the world,

857
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:27,440
Speaker 8:  But you can have me on every verge cast and we could always have somebody,

858
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,670
Speaker 8:  it didn't, he

859
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:32,420
Speaker 1:  Just do a live stream where he said some, some strange things.

860
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:36,470
Speaker 8:  Oh yeah. He gave an update on Starship, which is the

861
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,070
Speaker 8:  next generation vehicle that they're building is the same one that they are

862
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,640
Speaker 8:  building for NASA to take humans to the surface of the moon. And he just

863
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,330
Speaker 8:  gave an overview of, you know, its capabilities, what they hope to use it

864
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:51,050
Speaker 8:  for. And he made a new prediction

865
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,800
Speaker 8:  that it will fly to orbit for the first time in

866
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,670
Speaker 8:  January, maybe February. He doesn't know if it'll work

867
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,180
Speaker 8:  the first time, which to be fair. That's a, that's a good

868
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:05,750
Speaker 8:  prediction. Well, look, it's a, it's a, it's a very

869
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:09,710
Speaker 8:  ambitious vehicle and there's always gonna be

870
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:13,640
Speaker 8:  some, you know, explosions when you do something for the first time

871
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:17,600
Speaker 8:  and that's, that's basics the strategy. They kind of, they explode,

872
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,590
Speaker 8:  rebuild and do it again. You know? So it's, it's definitely, it's been

873
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:24,950
Speaker 8:  working out for them in terms of actually getting to

874
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,210
Speaker 8:  reliable flight hardware.

875
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:30,470
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Other space X news, right. They, they launched

876
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,860
Speaker 1:  four astronauts to the space station and brought them back, which is now

877
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,850
Speaker 1:  becoming a little bit of a, like a regular occurrence. It was

878
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:38,660
Speaker 1:  just like a big deal.

879
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,350
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I mean, it was just last year that we were all kind of like,

880
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,340
Speaker 8:  you know, watching an eager anticipation as

881
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,720
Speaker 8:  they launched their first two astronauts. And now since then they've had

882
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:55,340
Speaker 8:  five human space flight missions for, for

883
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:59,180
Speaker 8:  NASA and one that sent, you know, four private crew members

884
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,420
Speaker 8:  into orbit for three days. And I think it's, I was actually just thinking

885
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,320
Speaker 8:  of this before I came on. And I think it's good when these things come routine

886
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:10,100
Speaker 8:  become routine. It's, you know, a lot of companies get upset

887
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,730
Speaker 8:  after a while cause I'll stop covering their launches. And I'm

888
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:17,570
Speaker 8:  thinking it's good when I'm not covering your loss. I am

889
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:21,560
Speaker 8:  covering it. That means that something bad happened, you know? So it's good

890
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,520
Speaker 8:  when the stuff becomes boring because it means that we're doing it safely

891
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,660
Speaker 8:  and routinely. That's great.

892
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:29,900
Speaker 1:  And then lastly, I kinda was just on, we were talking a little bit about

893
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,050
Speaker 1:  Starlink Starlink has a new dish.

894
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,080
Speaker 1:  It's like a, it's like a little rectangle guy. I want you to

895
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,280
Speaker 8:  Get, I think it looks

896
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,130
Speaker 1:  Cool. So I'm the person with the Starling dish. I pay, I

897
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:45,110
Speaker 1:  pay for the service, the old one. It's what, 22 inches. This

898
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,900
Speaker 1:  one's like little, they said it's cheaper to make. They did not lower the

899
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,410
Speaker 1:  price.

900
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,020
Speaker 1:  Like a graded. Like when I say Starlink is a broadband company,

901
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:58,310
Speaker 1:  only broadband companies are like, we made the thing cheaper to make,

902
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,420
Speaker 1:  but we're going to keep charging you the same money. That is a very broadband

903
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:06,110
Speaker 1:  company attitude. The only real difference besides the

904
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:10,100
Speaker 1:  smaller size cheaper to make the up the wifi specs,

905
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,030
Speaker 1:  they still haven't opened the coverage areas. It still seems

906
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:17,810
Speaker 1:  delayed. Starlink space, X does not have a PR department.

907
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,080
Speaker 1:  We can't even ask. It's like hard to even ask questions about what's going

908
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:21,350
Speaker 1:  on.

909
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,080
Speaker 8:  Well, I have a PR department, they just don't respond to me.

910
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,880
Speaker 8:  And I'm curious if anyone has actually received this yet, because as I

911
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,690
Speaker 8:  understand it, they're very backlogged when it comes to new orders

912
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:37,620
Speaker 8:  because of the chip shortage. And then also, I guess we did a, we did a

913
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:41,250
Speaker 8:  story that if you change your address at all in the map

914
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,680
Speaker 8:  tool, it sends you to the back of the line. So

915
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,980
Speaker 3:  This is, this is the most amazing thing. So they have a tool where you can

916
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,790
Speaker 3:  like say what your service area is. And people were going to go

917
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,460
Speaker 3:  play with the map. I think there was like an email that you're supposed to

918
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:57,030
Speaker 3:  go like, look at it or something. And so people, the quotas, I moved

919
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:01,500
Speaker 3:  my location from my barn to my house, which is 13 feet. And now

920
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,400
Speaker 3:  my order has been moved back to late 20, 22. I was just like, don't

921
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,470
Speaker 3:  mess around with maps. You never know what will happen.

922
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:12,660
Speaker 1:  They've launched a lot more satellites since I did the review. So

923
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,680
Speaker 1:  I'm going to try it again. Like I said, I have the dish I've been paying

924
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,040
Speaker 1:  for it, but the key problem with startling is

925
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:24,300
Speaker 1:  even one utility pole in the, in your line of sight. And that whole arc

926
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:28,710
Speaker 1:  will interrupt your service and they it's just, they keep kind of just like

927
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,000
Speaker 1:  quietly not mentioning that.

928
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,950
Speaker 8:  I'm sure you got a lot of you did the review. Well,

929
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:39,540
Speaker 8:  yeah, I'm sure you get a lot of feedback on it. Can

930
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,130
Speaker 8:  I ask why you didn't put it on the roof?

931
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,550
Speaker 1:  Oh, on my house, she'll put it on a roof of my house. I'd have to go a hundred

932
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:48,240
Speaker 1:  feet in the air to clear the trees. So when I did drive

933
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,630
Speaker 1:  down, like, you know, the cells are pretty big. The honeycomb cells of service

934
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:55,440
Speaker 1:  are pretty big. So like just a little ways down the road,

935
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:58,590
Speaker 1:  there's a big overlook where it's totally clear. And I spent about a day

936
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,950
Speaker 1:  with it out there and the results were the same. The point I was trying to

937
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,850
Speaker 1:  make an interview was like, even this much. And even this little bit

938
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:09,300
Speaker 1:  at the sky is totally clear, but you've got like eight trees in the way.

939
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,800
Speaker 1:  You're basically looking into graded service. And so to get in my house to

940
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,100
Speaker 1:  get up over those trees, I'd have to put up a hundred foot pole.

941
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:17,910
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

942
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,660
Speaker 8:  I guess it would be good for like somebody in the desert or, you know, and

943
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,650
Speaker 8:  out and out in a very non wooded area.

944
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:29,370
Speaker 1:  Honestly, one of the most wholesome places on the entire, in this

945
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:32,970
Speaker 1:  entire subreddit is mad at me, but that's fine. But one of the most

946
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:36,450
Speaker 1:  wholesome places in the entire internet is the Starling subreddit, where

947
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:39,810
Speaker 1:  they're all just talking about how excited they are and like comparing their

948
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:43,050
Speaker 1:  test results and sharing. They're absolutely

949
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:46,890
Speaker 1:  bonkers installs, right? Like

950
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,160
Speaker 1:  just bonkers. Like somebody is like, I didn't want to wait for this poll

951
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,120
Speaker 1:  to come in. So I, I built a tower out of two by fours.

952
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:57,210
Speaker 1:  It's 60 feet in the air. Do you guys think this is good? And everyone's like,

953
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,840
Speaker 1:  you did such a good job. And it's like, it's all crazy. Like,

954
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:04,770
Speaker 1:  there's a lot of people being like, just cut down the trees. Like there's

955
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:08,760
Speaker 1:  like, there's a characters in the subreddit, you know? Like there's the

956
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:11,760
Speaker 1:  people who are like, just pay the money. Like it's worth it to spend

957
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,450
Speaker 1:  $40,000 on a utility pole at your house. And then there's the guys who are

958
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:19,260
Speaker 1:  like, just get a chainsaw, dude. It's worth it. And it's

959
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,980
Speaker 1:  like, all of this, it is legitimately just go to the Starling

960
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,560
Speaker 1:  subreddit and scroll it for awhile. Like there's hardcore nerds doing

961
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,700
Speaker 1:  satellite tracking. Like every time Starlink launches, new satellites,

962
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,780
Speaker 1:  they track when they come online, they measure the speeds and the latency.

963
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,260
Speaker 1:  And then there's like the chainsaw guys. And like, it's just like,

964
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:42,310
Speaker 1:  I read it consistently on Reddit. Cause it is just like the happiest little

965
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:44,830
Speaker 1:  community of nerds because Starling doesn't help them.

966
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,810
Speaker 8:  Right. It'd be really

967
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:50,650
Speaker 1:  Rough. So they've just built their own little community of support. I

968
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,800
Speaker 1:  know they're all mad at me, but I'm just telling I'm expressing to them.

969
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:57,310
Speaker 1:  I'm meeting your hatred with nothing but love because I love you

970
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:59,290
Speaker 8:  Put in your order for the new

971
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:02,890
Speaker 1:  It can't there's no, there's no option to upgrade your dish.

972
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,920
Speaker 8:  Oh, because you already bought yours. Cause

973
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,610
Speaker 1:  I already have one.

974
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:10,780
Speaker 8:  Oh, interesting. Okay. Well, I would, I would have loved to

975
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:14,260
Speaker 8:  see like the, the review part two where

976
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:18,370
Speaker 1:  I kept the new dish. If someone wants to come to my house and put up a hundred

977
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:22,300
Speaker 1:  foot pole, the doors open, it's just

978
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,890
Speaker 1:  also, you know, the cable, the other big improvement on the new dish is

979
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:30,580
Speaker 1:  that the cable detaches from the dish. So the one I have, the cable is

980
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:34,540
Speaker 1:  permanently attached to it. I see. So even if I did put up the a hundred

981
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:38,280
Speaker 1:  foot pole, I'd have to take a bunch of cable

982
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,800
Speaker 1:  with me. And then a route that brought that from the dish to the house instead

983
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,380
Speaker 1:  of the way that you'd normally do it. So they did make that big improvement

984
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,640
Speaker 3:  Looking at what are the installs of the new dish, which

985
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:52,480
Speaker 3:  apparently it's called squishy square pants. Oh good. This

986
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,890
Speaker 3:  predator, which is amazing and

987
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:54,940
Speaker 1:  Really startling subreddit.

988
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,900
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's, it's down to like putting calipers on every single part

989
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:02,590
Speaker 3:  of the cable that you can now unplug, like to show you

990
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:06,340
Speaker 3:  exactly like down to the millimeter, how wide the different pieces of it

991
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,230
Speaker 3:  are like the plug itself.

992
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,250
Speaker 1:  So you can route it through your

993
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,470
Speaker 3:  House. You can route it to your house and you can like figure out, you know,

994
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:14,080
Speaker 3:  if you would need to make any kind of Jager or whatever, to make sure it,

995
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,000
Speaker 3:  you know, stays for you, plug it in.

996
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:20,140
Speaker 1:  I'm telling you it's the most wholesome places. Great. It's I just,

997
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:24,070
Speaker 1:  I promise you like it is just bros, helping bros all day long in

998
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:26,350
Speaker 1:  every which way that you can think about it. That's great.

999
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:31,870
Speaker 1:  Well, it's good to have you back. We've missed you. There's an always an

1000
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:34,420
Speaker 1:  endless flood of space in the us. We'll have you back soon. Thanks for coming

1001
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:34,600
Speaker 1:  on.

1002
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,830
Speaker 8:  And every day it's something's popping off. So I'm sure I'll be back pretty

1003
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:39,100
Speaker 8:  soon.

1004
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:46,450
Speaker 9:  This is paid content presented by Volvo cars. If you've never driven a

1005
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:50,410
Speaker 9:  fully electric vehicle, like the Volvo XC 40 recharge before you might

1006
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:54,130
Speaker 9:  be wondering, what's it like? So we developed a course for electric

1007
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,340
Speaker 9:  vehicle first-timers they had a lot of questions.

1008
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:02,440
Speaker 10:  Ah, well I understand you're all here because somehow you've never driven

1009
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,280
Speaker 10:  a fully electric car before. Don't worry. You must have questions, but I'm

1010
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,780
Speaker 10:  here to answer them. Yes.

1011
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,450
Speaker 9:  You in the front, does it have to be plugged in to drive?

1012
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:15,160
Speaker 10:  What, how, how would that? No, no, no. Just plug it in when you get home

1013
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:18,220
Speaker 10:  and charge it up overnight, like you charge your phone for example.

1014
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:23,090
Speaker 10:  Okay. So who's ready. Take a look at Volvo XC 40

1015
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:23,780
Speaker 10:  recharge.

1016
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,730
Speaker 11:  What happens when there's traffic?

1017
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:32,300
Speaker 10:  The XC 40 recharge has regenerative braking. What's that?

1018
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,350
Speaker 10:  Okay. Think of it like this. You're going to be charging your car when you're

1019
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:40,190
Speaker 10:  stuck in traffic. So traffic becomes something you look forward to because

1020
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:43,850
Speaker 10:  it's charging your car and it's not just the engine that's helping the environment.

1021
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,060
Speaker 10:  No, no, no, no. There's more. This carpet is made from a hundred percent

1022
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,690
Speaker 10:  recycled pet water bottles. So it's not just premium. It's not just

1023
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:54,530
Speaker 10:  luxurious. It's made with a better world in mind. Oh. And Google is

1024
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:58,310
Speaker 10:  built into the <inaudible> recharge. So Google maps is

1025

1031

1044
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:19,780
Speaker 1:  Alex Cranz hello. You've returned to us, has a gun

1045
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,330
Speaker 11:  In the lake. I'm here. I'm ready to record.

1046
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:26,740
Speaker 1:  So big story this week. This was like the week before Thanksgiving.

1047
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:31,060
Speaker 1:  It's not like a flood of news. Like black Friday is coming. Like the new

1048
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:35,020
Speaker 1:  stuff is like kinda over, right? Like it's all holiday, like ship the stuff

1049
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:38,860
Speaker 1:  out mode for all the companies. But apple starts the week with a bang

1050
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:42,790
Speaker 1:  and they announced it kind of out of the blue, we're going to start letting

1051
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:46,270
Speaker 1:  people prepare their own I-phones are going to sell parts. And soon we're

1052
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:49,810
Speaker 1:  going to let you repair your M one. Max. It's interesting that

1053
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,600
Speaker 1:  it's like a weird line. Alex, tell us what's going on there. What was this

1054
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:55,990
Speaker 1:  announcement?

1055
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:59,950
Speaker 11:  Yeah. So they, they announced that they're gonna sell you little

1056
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:03,910
Speaker 11:  kits that we don't know how much those kits will cost or what

1057
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:07,780
Speaker 11:  will be in the kits that you can take and then repair your devices. And

1058
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:11,290
Speaker 11:  they're going to make all of the instruction manuals available online. So

1059
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:15,220
Speaker 11:  it's like really good extensively, unless you're I fix it. In

1060
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:17,920
Speaker 11:  which case it might not be great for your business model.

1061
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:22,950
Speaker 3:  They did a reaction video, which I watched and yeah, they're, they're, they're

1062
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:25,830
Speaker 3:  gung ho. Kyle's like, yep. Bring it on. I love competition. It's like all

1063
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:29,580
Speaker 3:  I've ever wanted, they're like welcome, welcome IBM or whatever. But

1064
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:33,750
Speaker 3:  they actually made a really good point, which is, you said, Alex, you know,

1065
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,710
Speaker 3:  it'll cost. I'm sure it will be a lot, but the fact that there's going to

1066
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:41,640
Speaker 3:  be the parts plus the manuals. So instead of trying

1067
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,300
Speaker 3:  to reverse engineer, all of the procedures, the, that the fact that apple

1068
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:49,050
Speaker 3:  is publishing repair manuals means that I fix it. We'll be able to like

1069
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:53,160
Speaker 3:  get a jumpstart on like creating proper procedures for their open source

1070
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,850
Speaker 3:  version of repair manuals. And instead of just like intuiting, what they

1071
01:02:56,850 --> 01:03:00,390
Speaker 3:  think is the right way to do it. And like guessing based on their tear

1072
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:04,020
Speaker 3:  downs, they'll actually see what like the official procedure is. And then

1073
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:07,950
Speaker 3:  they can base their version of that procedure if they, you know, get different

1074
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,790
Speaker 3:  parts or whatever off of that. And then the third key part is the

1075
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:15,390
Speaker 3:  software, like the configuration software so that you don't have to replace

1076
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:19,350
Speaker 3:  like ridiculous, tiny micro solder chips. If you want

1077
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:21,510
Speaker 3:  face ID or true tone or whatever, to continue to work,

1078
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,230
Speaker 11:  There's like something to be optimistic about. But for me, it's hard to

1079
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:28,650
Speaker 11:  be super excited until we know what it is like, are they going to be sending

1080
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:32,340
Speaker 11:  you the screwdrivers with the very, the proprietary screw bits

1081
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,760
Speaker 11:  or you're going to have to go still buy those somewhere else? Are they going

1082
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,540
Speaker 11:  to sell you a heat gun? So you can crack open your iPhone

1083
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:43,320
Speaker 11:  13, which currently requires heat to like break the S the

1084
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,040
Speaker 11:  water proof seals. Like, there's just a lot of stuff we don't

1085
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,430
Speaker 11:  know. So it's like, this seems really, really cool. And I think that, I

1086
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,890
Speaker 11:  think you're bang on, like, it's the instruction manuals here. That's really

1087
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:55,260
Speaker 11:  the successful part of this. And this is really the exciting part of it

1088
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:58,920
Speaker 11:  is like the actual kits. I think there's just too many things up in the

1089
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,250
Speaker 11:  air for us to be like, anything but optimistic about them.

1090
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,330
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I will say this, the steps here are first, you have to

1091
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:09,810
Speaker 1:  review the online repair manual. Like, I just love the idea that Apple's

1092
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:13,710
Speaker 1:  going to be like, are you sure? Like, look at how hard it is and you

1093
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:17,670
Speaker 1:  click through that. And then you place an order. Apple says they will offer

1094
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:21,210
Speaker 1:  more than 200 individual parts and tools. So

1095
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:25,080
Speaker 1:  whether or not the Johnny ive heat gun is coming, you

1096
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,740
Speaker 1:  never know fingers crossed, but it does seem like a Pental lobe. Screwdriver

1097
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:32,520
Speaker 1:  is coming like the word tools. Like it's, you know,

1098
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:36,600
Speaker 1:  they're going to make a hammer and a wrench and a screwdriver. So we'll see

1099
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,380
Speaker 1:  what that means. But 200 individual parts and tools it's very often 12 and

1100
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:44,230
Speaker 1:  13 currently, which are not like repairable phones.

1101
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:48,210
Speaker 1:  No, not really. They are held together with glue and weird screws in

1102
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:51,810
Speaker 1:  lots of ways. So it's interesting that they walk this back. I would say this

1103
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:55,620
Speaker 1:  was met with like uniform excitement, right? Cause

1104
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:59,490
Speaker 1:  even if all you're doing is you click through the thing, you order the parts

1105
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:03,900
Speaker 1:  and then you go to a service provider who's good at this massive

1106
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,890
Speaker 1:  win, right? Like I think this is like right now, if you go to get

1107
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:11,250
Speaker 1:  your iPhone screen repaired, you have no idea. If you're getting an OEM

1108
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:15,090
Speaker 1:  screen, you have no idea if face ID is going to work

1109
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:17,860
Speaker 1:  anymore. Like there are lots of people who are good at taking the screens

1110
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:21,700
Speaker 1:  off life. They've not had access to parts or been able to do this in a particularly

1111
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,220
Speaker 1:  official way, or been able to preserve your warranty.

1112
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,460
Speaker 3:  And in fact, this is a better win. Even if you live in a world where like

1113
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:30,970
Speaker 3:  you think, well, go to one of the official independent repair shops that

1114
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,780
Speaker 3:  are like blessed by apple because the forms and the NDAs and the

1115
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:37,540
Speaker 3:  agreements you have to sign to become, one of those shops are actually relatively

1116
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:41,500
Speaker 3:  onerous. And so even if all apple has done here is like change the

1117
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:45,310
Speaker 3:  change that program for repair shops and just like made the website available

1118
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:49,120
Speaker 3:  to the public, getting rid of those agreements and forms. So that,

1119
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,640
Speaker 3:  like you said, you know, you could like go and buy the part and take it to

1120
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,170
Speaker 3:  somebody else is a big one.

1121
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:57,370
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I don't think apple can NDA you out of like you, when the order,

1122
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:59,860
Speaker 1:  the thing, they might be able to make you click a box and say, you have to

1123
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:03,580
Speaker 1:  do it yourself. But like, we're not in the panopticon metaverse

1124
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,450
Speaker 1:  yet Tim cook,

1125
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,550
Speaker 1:  someone else can use that screwdriver. And you will never know. I

1126
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:11,860
Speaker 3:  Don't know if you read the iTunes terms of service lately.

1127
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:16,930
Speaker 1:  So that's all good. And I think universal praise and then kind of the

1128
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:20,530
Speaker 1:  conversation immediately turned to, well, why would apple do this? And the

1129
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:24,490
Speaker 1:  first cut was to satisfy regulators. And

1130
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:28,390
Speaker 1:  this will mean nothing, which all deference to our friend, John Gruber is

1131
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:32,170
Speaker 1:  kind of his take. You can go read and daring fireball. I would just argue

1132
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:35,770
Speaker 1:  like, there's already a massive market for iPhone repair. Like you're not

1133
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:39,490
Speaker 1:  inventing a market. You're just, legitimising an already huge market.

1134
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:44,200
Speaker 1:  So I think this is going to get, take up because you can already, we don't

1135
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,170
Speaker 1:  have to invent a demand. We don't have to invent a consumer who might want

1136
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:50,710
Speaker 1:  this. They already exist. They're already being served. Now. They just have

1137
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:54,250
Speaker 1:  better parts. Cool. But then there's like something else going on here, like

1138
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:58,000
Speaker 1:  a shareholder lawsuit that might've actually pushed

1139
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,450
Speaker 1:  apple. Yeah.

1140
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:01,780
Speaker 11:  The, the shareholder that it was an, an activist

1141
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:05,350
Speaker 11:  shareholders from the mutual fund green

1142
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:09,280
Speaker 11:  century who has love and mutual funds. And

1143
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:13,090
Speaker 11:  they had back in September, filed with the

1144
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:16,960
Speaker 11:  sec saying, Hey, apple needs to serious we're we're

1145
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,950
Speaker 11:  shareholders. And we as shareholders, demand that apple think

1146
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,700
Speaker 11:  long and hard about its right to repair stance and change

1147
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:28,660
Speaker 11:  things. And apparently this past Wednesday was

1148
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:32,560
Speaker 11:  supposed to be the deadline for apple Blake do something. And

1149
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,160
Speaker 11:  so apple did this and those shareholders were like, well,

1150
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:39,730
Speaker 11:  okay, I guess we're withdrawing this because they did something. And they

1151
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:42,850
Speaker 11:  still have to like, look at it. They said, it's not like off the table,

1152
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:46,720
Speaker 11:  but, but yeah, it seemed, they are very much taking credit for

1153
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,350
Speaker 11:  this move.

1154
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,160
Speaker 1:  So what's interesting is they aren't taking credit. I mean, we have a story,

1155
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:54,880
Speaker 1:  Maddie stone art or science editor read it. So apple told us on the

1156
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,660
Speaker 1:  record, back on policy, coming through apple says the program has been in

1157
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:02,500
Speaker 1:  development for well over a year, describing it as the next step in

1158
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,430
Speaker 1:  increasing access to apple, genuine parts, tools and manuals, they would

1159
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:10,090
Speaker 1:  not say whether the announcement is influenced by the shareholder lawsuit.

1160
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:13,240
Speaker 11:  They would not say that people

1161
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,910
Speaker 1:  Would not say in the shareholders, like the timing is no

1162
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:20,480
Speaker 1:  coincidence. So it's not like a settlement, right. Where the

1163
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,600
Speaker 1:  shareholders sued and apple said, we'll do this. And the shareholders agreed

1164
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,530
Speaker 1:  to back off. Maybe it was. And they're all just

1165
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:30,800
Speaker 1:  like agreed to not talk about it. Right. It's like the end of back to the

1166
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,550
Speaker 1:  future where you're trying to connect the two things and like, oh, they're

1167
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:35,900
Speaker 1:  so close. We're not quite connecting.

1168
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:40,820
Speaker 11:  I think what was interesting with this was initially apple was like,

1169
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,240
Speaker 11:  no, leave us alone. You're you're trying to change our business. And that's

1170
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,630
Speaker 11:  outside the realm of shareholders. But then the sec had

1171
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:51,680
Speaker 11:  issued new guidance between the filing. And

1172
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,430
Speaker 11:  now that said, actually, we're going to carve it out. And

1173
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:59,030
Speaker 11:  shareholders can protest. If it's something to do that res if it

1174
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:03,140
Speaker 11:  shareholders can protest, if it raises significant social

1175
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:06,650
Speaker 11:  policy issues, which theoretically the right to

1176
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,450
Speaker 11:  repair factors into.

1177
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:12,440
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So apple had asked CSCC, Hey, we've got a holders thing. Can we just

1178
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,160
Speaker 3:  like, don't do anything about this. We got to like study it. And we got to

1179
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,550
Speaker 3:  blah, blah, blah. And it seems like the way it usually goes is the STC is

1180
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:22,730
Speaker 3:  like, okay, we'll like, go have fun. Well, we'll talk later.

1181
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:27,620
Speaker 3:  But, but as Alex was saying, they issued new guidance saying that

1182
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:31,190
Speaker 3:  like, if it's like, God, like societal impact, we're not gonna,

1183
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:34,580
Speaker 3:  like, we're not going to just let you go have fun. Like, we're actually are,

1184
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,450
Speaker 3:  are going to look into it when investors come to us. And so apple, like two

1185
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:42,320
Speaker 3:  days before the deadline, when like this investor group, the mutual fund

1186
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,620
Speaker 3:  was going to, like, it was going to happen. They're like, just kidding. We're

1187
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:46,730
Speaker 3:  you can repair stuff. Now

1188
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:50,720
Speaker 1:  I will say, and maybe it has been involved in it for over a year for something

1189
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,560
Speaker 1:  that's been in development for over a year. Not a lot of information

1190
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:58,580
Speaker 1:  on how it will work. Yeah. None like at the

1191
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,230
Speaker 1:  end of the day, what we have from apple is

1192
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:04,580
Speaker 1:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

1193
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:06,980
Speaker 1:  paragraphs, and a couple of cartoons.

1194
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:10,640
Speaker 3:  Well, all of their copywriters are busy right now, writing the new

1195
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,300
Speaker 3:  policy for an app payment links or links to

1196
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:17,990
Speaker 3:  things because that deadline is coming very fast and that they, that appeal

1197
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:21,740
Speaker 3:  is still like up in the air. So like they can't, they can't do both at the

1198
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:25,040
Speaker 3:  same time. Obviously to me, what this is, is like

1199
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,970
Speaker 3:  regulatory pressure can work. Even if there's not a law

1200
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,930
Speaker 3:  passed or an action taken. Yeah. Like the, the overall

1201
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:36,470
Speaker 3:  environment of legislatures and like regulatory bodies

1202
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:39,980
Speaker 3:  looking at tech companies will spur them to action

1203
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:44,060
Speaker 3:  sometimes in order to like fend off future action. But it

1204
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:44,450
Speaker 3:  does stop.

1205
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:48,560
Speaker 1:  This is the program that apple designed, right? Right. That's a win for

1206
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,710
Speaker 1:  apple. This is their program. They have decided that it's the iPhone 12 and

1207
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:55,610
Speaker 1:  13, they're picking the heat, guns and screwdrivers are

1208
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:59,420
Speaker 1:  going to sell or whatever it is. They're deciding it's only M one

1209
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:03,380
Speaker 1:  max. Right? They've, they've chosen. And by the way, the

1210
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:07,370
Speaker 1:  iPhone 12 and 13, the newest I-phones. So if you think

1211
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:11,180
Speaker 1:  about your batteries slowing down your phone, it's getting old, your phone's

1212
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:15,090
Speaker 1:  starting to throttle itself. Well, that's not the iPhone 12 and 13 yet. And

1213
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:19,530
Speaker 1:  by the way, apple, Tim cook himself on investor calls has

1214
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:23,370
Speaker 1:  said, when they rolled out the battery replacement program, their upgrades

1215
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:26,880
Speaker 1:  went down because people realize that could change their batteries over

1216
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:30,780
Speaker 1:  and their phones would perform fast again. And I mean, remember, this was

1217
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:34,680
Speaker 1:  a scandal. People believed in apple denied

1218
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:38,160
Speaker 1:  for years, that iPhones automatically started slowing down. After two years

1219
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,090
Speaker 1:  to force you to upgrade apple maintained. Nope. That's just your

1220
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:45,840
Speaker 1:  battery getting older. And in order to prevent your phone from shutting off,

1221
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,680
Speaker 1:  because it can't provide the voltage, we're throttling the processor to make

1222
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,710
Speaker 1:  your phone, keep running. This is all very innocent. We just didn't tell

1223
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:56,190
Speaker 1:  you about it. The cops,

1224
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:00,450
Speaker 1:  they announced the battery replacement program. Now you can just replace

1225
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:04,440
Speaker 1:  your battery. And they had to admit to their investors. Yep. Our upgrades

1226
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,280
Speaker 1:  took a hit because people could just replace the batteries. Well,

1227
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:11,130
Speaker 1:  I fund 12 and 13. They're not the phones in either batteries replaced right

1228
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:14,490
Speaker 1:  now. Yeah. So like this, I would just say like,

1229
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,180
Speaker 1:  you're right. It's the threat of regulation, lawsuits, all this stuff, this

1230
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:21,540
Speaker 1:  cloud, that's hanging over tech companies right now. But the win for apple

1231
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:25,500
Speaker 1:  is they're doing it on their terms. And then backing off the pressure. Why

1232
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,500
Speaker 1:  M one max, not Intel mats, which they still sell.

1233
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:32,100
Speaker 11:  Well, the, the M ones, they don't the batteries. And so you can actually

1234
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,300
Speaker 11:  replace the battery now.

1235
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:37,350
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean, it may be that they, they knew that they were doing this. And

1236
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:40,950
Speaker 3:  so they like, they made them slightly easier to repair question mark, not

1237
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:42,780
Speaker 3:  the phones, not the phones. Yeah.

1238
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:44,970
Speaker 1:  They designed the iPhone 13, three

1239
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:48,420
Speaker 3:  Years ago. Here's my big question. What does an apple design heat gun look

1240
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:51,690
Speaker 3:  like? And if they, if they commissioned Johnny ive to help make it from love

1241
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:55,050
Speaker 3:  from like, do you plug it? Is it, is it charged? Does a charge of the lightning

1242
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:58,260
Speaker 3:  cable does a lightning cable plug in like in the center of like where the

1243
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:01,140
Speaker 3:  heat that actually has the exhaust. So it's like the apple mouse. Like you

1244
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,020
Speaker 3:  can't have it, plug it in these at the same time. It's going to be

1245
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:06,980
Speaker 1:  Great. You're going to have you say, I fixed it. Doesn't use a gun. They

1246
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:09,390
Speaker 11:  Have like, what's essentially, it looks like a hot plate

1247
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,630
Speaker 3:  And they place it. They have a giant TD pad and it's cause they can, they

1248
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:15,660
Speaker 3:  can precisely control the temperature that way. I feel

1249
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,520
Speaker 11:  Like that's expensive. I feel like most people are.

1250
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:21,780
Speaker 1:  So all the old air power mats that didn't get sold that were overheating

1251
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:25,530
Speaker 1:  had been repurposed to the repair

1252
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:25,910
Speaker 1:  program.

1253
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:29,790
Speaker 3:  So speaking of Briggs though, this is like the last thing, which is apple

1254
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:33,690
Speaker 3:  might publish these documents and it might be the

1255
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:36,510
Speaker 3:  instructions for taking apart. An iPhone 13 requires a

1256
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:40,410
Speaker 3:  $14,000 rig. And we won't tell you how to do it without the rig,

1257
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:41,490
Speaker 3:  but that's a real positive.

1258
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,010
Speaker 1:  This is what I mean. If you're telling me that this has been in the works

1259
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:47,960
Speaker 1:  for over a year and you're, you're announcing it today, time

1260
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:51,930
Speaker 1:  do a shareholder lawsuit, expiration date, and you're not ready to

1261
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:55,770
Speaker 1:  roll it out until next year. I dunno, man. Like maybe even talking about

1262
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:59,360
Speaker 1:  it for a year. And like someone just pulled the ripcord. Yeah. That

1263
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:03,300
Speaker 1:  timing with apple, apple historically famously announced

1264
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:07,350
Speaker 1:  things. When they're ready to go very rarely

1265
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:11,140
Speaker 1:  pre announces products that are not ready to ship like 3,200 parts. So we'll

1266
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:14,620
Speaker 1:  see. But I am looking forward to an apple beautiful

1267
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:18,550
Speaker 1:  aluminum heat gun. It's going to be gorgeous. Oh man, it'd be like that.

1268
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:21,250
Speaker 1:  You know that, that they're going to do it because aluminum conducts so much

1269
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:25,090
Speaker 1:  heat. They won't realize that humans have to hold it and then Belkin will

1270
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:28,600
Speaker 1:  make a holder for it. Here's my question. If Illumina, if the heat gun has

1271
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,590
Speaker 1:  a battery, we be able to replace the battery. That's

1272
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:36,310
Speaker 1:  enough of this other little apple news. They delayed

1273
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:40,180
Speaker 1:  Zoe Schiffer. Now NBC news broke the story. They're

1274
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:43,450
Speaker 1:  delaying returned to work until February and changing the policies

1275
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,470
Speaker 1:  continues to be a drama for apple. And we'll see how that

1276
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:51,340
Speaker 1:  goes. And then mark Gurman at Bloomberg. I can't get enough apple

1277
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:55,060
Speaker 1:  car story. It's my favorite. So apple now wants to

1278
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:58,510
Speaker 1:  launch a self-driving Evie in 2025 with its own ship.

1279
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:02,710
Speaker 1:  I have to say, and I always talk to Grumman. He gets great scripts. It's

1280
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:06,700
Speaker 1:  just funny that apple thinks making a custom chip, which is the thing it's

1281
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,910
Speaker 1:  good at. Yeah. Will be the thing that allows them to ship a car, which is

1282
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:13,510
Speaker 1:  the thing that it's bad at. I love it. Like of course they're going to make

1283
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,420
Speaker 1:  a customer. Like obviously that's the only thing they know how to do at this

1284
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:19,930
Speaker 1:  point in terms of the car, right? Do they know how to make

1285
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:23,560
Speaker 1:  wheels like unclean? They made the back pro

1286
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:29,590
Speaker 1:  tiny wheels. So the story here is Kevin Lynch who

1287
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:33,010
Speaker 1:  ran the watch by the way, resuscitated his career after Adobe and apple

1288
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:36,580
Speaker 1:  amazing run with the Washington stuff is now in charge of the car project

1289
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,480
Speaker 1:  they were, who knows what they've been doing in the past. There are now a

1290
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:44,410
Speaker 1:  new focus on self-driving, right? The point of this car is that it can drive

1291
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:46,870
Speaker 1:  it and it will have no steering wheel. And they're going to launch it in

1292
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:47,590
Speaker 1:  four years.

1293
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:51,640
Speaker 11:  Okay. I want to have that confidence in life. I want to

1294
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:55,570
Speaker 11:  walk through the world with a confidence that the car design team at apple.

1295
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,190
Speaker 1:  Well, that just means they're going to get fine.

1296
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:01,030
Speaker 11:  Nevermind. Nevermind. I don't want that confidence.

1297
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:06,340
Speaker 1:  I just saying like the, I talked to an awful lot of car

1298
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:10,060
Speaker 1:  executives on decoder, right? It kind of every layer of the

1299
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,900
Speaker 1:  industry from the CEO's to project, man, like we've just talked to an

1300
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,350
Speaker 1:  awful lot of car folks. I've talked to the CEOs of LIDAR

1301
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:20,920
Speaker 1:  companies and self-driving companies, none of them are

1302
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,340
Speaker 1:  saying, we're going to have a product in four years,

1303
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:28,330
Speaker 1:  not a one, right? Like your data collection problem is

1304
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:31,930
Speaker 1:  insane. Your sensor problem is insane. Your

1305
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:35,530
Speaker 1:  regulatory problem is insane. Like I just, it's

1306
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:39,520
Speaker 1:  amazing that this is the target. And maybe it's just a bold target,

1307
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:43,660
Speaker 1:  but like Waymo, which is the industry leader will not

1308
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:47,410
Speaker 1:  commit to 40. Like, and they've already got

1309
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:51,070
Speaker 1:  Chrysler Pacific as wandering the streets of San Francisco in

1310
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:54,610
Speaker 1:  Phoenix, without drivers behind the wheel, like they're

1311
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:58,450
Speaker 1:  operating a taxi service and they're not like we're ready to go. Here's a

1312
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,380
Speaker 1:  huge problem for like Waymo's cars to Quadro Malecon

1313
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:06,220
Speaker 1:  was on Dakota. We talked to code and she's on the cutter. You can go

1314
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:09,830
Speaker 1:  listen to it. I was like, can you put a car in Denver and was like, no,

1315
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:16,820
Speaker 1:  right? Like, they're like, snow's a problem for us. The cool that's

1316
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:20,420
Speaker 1:  like pretty big problem. And like, she was like very

1317
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:23,600
Speaker 1:  sincere. Like, she's like, that's the next challenge. I just don't see how

1318
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,230
Speaker 1:  apple they're. There still are operating so far behind that curve.

1319
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,600
Speaker 1:  They've never put a person in a car.

1320
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:33,410
Speaker 3:  Here's my concern. You know, Apple's not saying anything about the car. They're

1321
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:35,750
Speaker 3:  certainly not saying they're not certainly not giving to that. But someone

1322
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,930
Speaker 3:  inside apple, must've given this deadline to someone. And so the concern

1323
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:42,590
Speaker 3:  with the car is the same as a concern with like that health stuff. Right.

1324
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:47,270
Speaker 3:  Is apple being honest with itself about its capabilities

1325
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:51,110
Speaker 3:  and about what it's going to be able to ship? Like, are they giving themselves

1326
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:54,950
Speaker 3:  like true deadlines and do they actually know what they are capable of and

1327
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:58,940
Speaker 3:  not capable of internally? Or is there like, is there

1328
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:02,570
Speaker 3:  a culture of, we can do anything in there that is going to end up burning

1329
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:02,780
Speaker 3:  them?

1330
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:07,250
Speaker 1:  Yes. I think it's both, right. I mean, either you have a car that can drive

1331
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,270
Speaker 1:  itself or you don't.

1332
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:13,670
Speaker 3:  No, no, no. There's a middle ground. It's called full self-driving on a model

1333
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:13,910
Speaker 3:  three.

1334
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,320
Speaker 1:  Right. But like even full self-driving, like give Tessa credit. Like they,

1335
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:22,060
Speaker 1:  they keep putting that software out in the world. They keep selling the

1336
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:26,150
Speaker 1:  sensor kits to people. When they buy the cars. They're not like this is ready.

1337
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:30,170
Speaker 1:  Right? Like Elan's like next week self-track full self-driving will

1338
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:33,650
Speaker 1:  be ready. And he will set the huge prediction.

1339
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:37,430
Speaker 1:  And now every Tesla customer, no matter how much you love Ilan or not, you

1340
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:41,090
Speaker 1:  know, in your heart, he's going to miss the deadline and Tesla to its credit

1341
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,110
Speaker 1:  is not overclaiming. The name is bad and they should change the name

1342
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:48,530
Speaker 1:  because I think it confuses everyone. But including the people

1343
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:52,220
Speaker 1:  driving the cars, but like, Tesla's not saying it's ready

1344
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,720
Speaker 1:  and they have as much data about actual human beings behind the wheel of

1345
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:00,560
Speaker 1:  self-driving cars to anyone. I just, I see this stuff from apple. And it's

1346
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,620
Speaker 1:  like at the end of the day, and we talked about this last week with Sean

1347
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,670
Speaker 1:  at the end of the day, they have so much money that they

1348
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:10,730
Speaker 1:  need to attack markets. We're spending that money is worth it

1349
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,080
Speaker 1:  where they have a huge advantage because of their pile of cash. Yeah. And

1350
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,590
Speaker 1:  the car industry is like one of those markets.

1351
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:21,380
Speaker 3:  It's like, there's, there's the, there's a microfiber cloth industry.

1352
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:25,330
Speaker 1:  It's the clock, the cloth industry. Yeah. Textiles. Apple's gonna be big

1353
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,980
Speaker 1:  in the textiles. I mean, they give you a Samsung with it. They could start

1354
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:31,690
Speaker 1:  making nuclear reactors, submarines boats.

1355
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:35,390
Speaker 1:  Like if you just look at the like consumer products, making a

1356
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:39,140
Speaker 1:  TV is like almost not worth the money and attention for apple. They could

1357
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:43,040
Speaker 1:  buy an old led factory tomorrow in China. And like,

1358
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,790
Speaker 1:  it wouldn't, it wouldn't hit the bank account. Like cut, like a couple of

1359
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:50,750
Speaker 1:  zeros would go down or whatever. Like it's, there's just a piece of

1360
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:53,690
Speaker 1:  the puzzle where they're like, yep. This is a place where we have a moat

1361
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:57,380
Speaker 1:  in the moat is cashed and that might not be technology or focus or an idea

1362
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:00,230
Speaker 1:  of what a car should do. And I think that's how you get to, we're gonna launch

1363
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:04,220
Speaker 1:  it in four years ahead of every other player in the industry that

1364
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:07,770
Speaker 1:  has been relentlessly focused and instead of like hiring teams and firing

1365
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:11,430
Speaker 1:  teams. So we'll see. I just want to know what you think the apple car will

1366
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:15,300
Speaker 1:  look like because we keep seeing new EVs and they all

1367
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:19,170
Speaker 1:  look nuts, right? Like they either look like robot fish,

1368
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,680
Speaker 1:  which is my favorite design trend of all time. Or like, like

1369
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:26,940
Speaker 1:  Toyota lately is deep in the robot fish zone. Like go look at the new

1370
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:30,810
Speaker 1:  Tundra. This is gigantic robot fish. Or they,

1371
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,800
Speaker 1:  they look they're, they're all doing the, the light bars across

1372
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,700
Speaker 1:  the face. And they look like that emoji with the line for the face,

1373
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:42,240
Speaker 1:  which I, which Dieter I have to admit, I think it was the Dieter emoji.

1374
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,720
Speaker 1:  Oh my God. You know the emojis, the smiley face, but it's just the line.

1375
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:48,900
Speaker 1:  Yeah. That's me. Yeah. That's yeah. Cause you sent it to me a lot.

1376
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,220
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Well it's so it, it says so much like

1377
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,730
Speaker 3:  it's the most expressive emoji, honestly. What if apple goes

1378
01:20:56,730 --> 01:21:00,600
Speaker 3:  like, like screw it and they just copy a Hyundai is

1379
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,020
Speaker 3:  a grander. Did you seen the, this retro Evy

1380
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,020
Speaker 3:  awesome car.

1381
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:09,420
Speaker 1:  It's very good. It's very, do you ever seen the movie in time?

1382
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:13,230
Speaker 1:  People, may people made this reference to this movie? So there's an old movie.

1383
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:17,030
Speaker 1:  It's Justin Timberlake movie. I want to say. Yeah. Yeah,

1384
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:20,550
Speaker 1:  yeah. And he's like, he's like a kid. And like, instead of

1385
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:24,240
Speaker 1:  currency, the world uses time and you can run out of time. Lots of time.

1386
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:28,650
Speaker 1:  And so all throughout this movie, in this like weird future,

1387
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:31,890
Speaker 1:  they all drive crazy restaurant cars. Like he drives like a challenger, but

1388
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:35,550
Speaker 1:  they're all EVs. And this concept reminds me of that movie. It's so

1389
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:39,450
Speaker 1:  good. It looks like a 1980s Chrysler. Yeah. Yeah. Hyundai actually did have

1390
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:41,640
Speaker 1:  a car that looked like this called the granddaughter, which has copy of a

1391
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:45,540
Speaker 1:  19 days Chrysler, which is great. But yeah, I I'm, I'm confident that this

1392
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:49,440
Speaker 1:  car has a 0.0 crash rating. Yeah. But I would buy it in

1393
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,330
Speaker 1:  one heartbeat. If it was for sale,

1394
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,670
Speaker 3:  You put this thing in a wind tunnel that would just flip over.

1395
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:59,400
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Car design right now is just a, it's a lot of weird ideas. I

1396
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,880
Speaker 1:  would say like the fact that you don't need a grill anymore. I think it's

1397
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,720
Speaker 1:  just confusing a lot of car designers. So they're like, like BMW is like,

1398
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,230
Speaker 1:  but what if the grills were the whole car? Yeah. And as I just, I'm dying

1399
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:14,100
Speaker 1:  to know like it's apple can make a mid-size crossover, but

1400
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:18,030
Speaker 1:  yes, if you're gonna, are you gonna make a $60,000 mid-sized crossover?

1401
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:21,980
Speaker 1:  Like, is that just like a boring pro product for apple?

1402
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:26,040
Speaker 3:  It's going to be like $80,000. It's going to be $200,000.

1403
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,840
Speaker 3:  It's going to be impeccable on those seats.

1404
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:35,370
Speaker 1:  I there's just like there's. Yeah. There's the in and out of the car market.

1405
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:38,460
Speaker 1:  There's the, it's a tech problem. It's an AI problem. There's a reasons then

1406
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:41,790
Speaker 1:  you think about the actual product they have to deliver to people. Like,

1407
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:44,130
Speaker 1:  are they going to have proprietary tires?

1408
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:47,730
Speaker 3:  Will there be a right to repair, repair manual for it?

1409
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:49,890
Speaker 3:  Can you get it fixed at

1410
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:54,360
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Can you go to the Midas and have the fluids changed? Can I get

1411
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:58,650
Speaker 3:  Change at Jiffy lube and we'll use premium fuel. It's

1412
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:00,150
Speaker 3:  easy. Isn't it? That's like,

1413
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:04,620
Speaker 1:  I think you're making a gas car. That would be the best. I

1414
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:08,470
Speaker 1:  hope it's Tim cook was like, and we've uncovered a revolutionary power

1415
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:12,070
Speaker 1:  source. It's been right under our noses the entire time. Yeah. It's called

1416
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:12,580
Speaker 1:  diesel.

1417
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:22,810
Speaker 1:  Alright. So lightning round things here. This bell muda phone. I don't, I

1418
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:25,570
Speaker 1:  don't even know Dieter. Can you explain this toaster phone? To me? There's

1419
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:25,750
Speaker 1:  a,

1420
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:29,770
Speaker 3:  A high-end toaster company in Japan, a CAPA muda they make, they make lots

1421
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:32,980
Speaker 3:  of cool stuff and they have made an Android phone. I just wanted to talk

1422
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,730
Speaker 3:  about it. To encourage you to go to the website, pull over in your car, pull

1423
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:40,450
Speaker 3:  in your car first. It does look cool. Go to the website. It's like a

1424
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:44,620
Speaker 3:  half circle, like a wedge it's like wider and it's aspect ratio than

1425
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:47,980
Speaker 3:  most phones. It's relatively small. I'm sure it's terrible.

1426
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:52,210
Speaker 3:  But it looks so good. And it's like, yeah. You know what it

1427
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:55,600
Speaker 3:  reminds me of, even though it's got perfectly flat screen, I was like for

1428
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,600
Speaker 3:  the hot minute, when we had like concave screens,

1429
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,250
Speaker 3:  like the galaxy nexus and you know that Samsung was, I miss

1430
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:06,760
Speaker 3:  those. It reminds me of that a little bit. Anyway. Bring back weird phone

1431
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,130
Speaker 3:  shapes. That's the only thing I wanted to say about this thing. It looks

1432
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:09,460
Speaker 3:  sick.

1433
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:13,630
Speaker 1:  I want to buy this toaster. The toaster is $300. It's gotta be a good toaster.

1434
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:18,250
Speaker 1:  I went by the toaster. Okay. And then here's, this is like such a funny

1435
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:22,300
Speaker 1:  Facebook story. They demoed a haptic glove. They're

1436
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:26,110
Speaker 1:  very proud of it for the metaverse it's uses

1437
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:30,100
Speaker 1:  like new micro fluids and pneumatics to like, feel pressure. So it feels

1438
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:34,090
Speaker 1:  like you're like, it can resist your fingers. Cool. And then immediately

1439
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:37,090
Speaker 1:  the next day, a company called haptics is like, dude, you just copied our

1440
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:40,630
Speaker 1:  glove. Like that's our glove. Like it's the same technology. It looks just

1441
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:44,410
Speaker 1:  like ours. So we don't know what's going on there. Here's my only question.

1442
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:48,610
Speaker 1:  Phase Metta, Metta, Metta is buying everything

1443
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:52,180
Speaker 1:  in VR. They just bought supernatural Peter Kafka, Recode reporter. That was

1444
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:55,540
Speaker 1:  a $500 million deal. I have no idea if supernatural is worth

1445
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:58,840
Speaker 1:  $500 million. I think Zuckerberg just wrote the check. Why didn't they just

1446
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:02,820
Speaker 1:  buy this company? Like it's

1447
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:06,610
Speaker 1:  such an unforced dumb error. Like who else are they going to solve a haptic

1448
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:07,240
Speaker 1:  gloves to

1449
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,230
Speaker 11:  It's like one exec was like, no, we can do those ourselves. But he got

1450
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:13,240
Speaker 11:  slighted at a Bennigan's or something. It was like,

1451
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,360
Speaker 1:  I've actually been working up on micro microfluid glove concept of my

1452
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:21,460
Speaker 1:  very good Sonos at a DTS support to its

1453
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:25,570
Speaker 1:  home theater stuff. I'm only calling this out because you, the

1454
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:28,720
Speaker 1:  Vergecast listener, this is our community that cares about

1455
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:33,340
Speaker 1:  DTS. Supports. People are very excited about it. Even the

1456
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:35,590
Speaker 1:  play bars, getting it. Wow.

1457
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:40,870
Speaker 3:  That's nuts. I've got to play bar. I'm very excited,

1458
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:42,020
Speaker 3:  very excited.

1459
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:45,850
Speaker 1:  You've got your blue rays and listen to some D B DTS stuff. I

1460
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,520
Speaker 1:  almost said BTS are going to listen to some BTS Blu-rays

1461
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,420
Speaker 3:  I think the last thing is, so the pixel six

1462
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:59,740
Speaker 3:  Google never said what kind of

1463
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:02,890
Speaker 3:  wattage it could take. They would only give you numbers. It'll charge from

1464
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:07,150
Speaker 3:  to 80% in half an hour or something they would give you like charge times.

1465
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:10,010
Speaker 3:  They wouldn't tell you how many Watts it could take to fast charge. They'd

1466
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:13,790
Speaker 3:  also told you they will sell you a wireless charger. Eventually that will

1467
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:17,420
Speaker 3:  charge as fast as plugging it in. That's pretty much it. And then

1468
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:21,080
Speaker 3:  alongside the pixel six, they sold a 30 watt charger. If you want to buy

1469
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,210
Speaker 3:  a charger because it doesn't come with the box, you can buy a 30 watt charger.

1470
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:26,810
Speaker 3:  And I was like, cool, guess the charges at 30 Watts? Nope.

1471
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:32,630
Speaker 3:  It turns out it, it charges like somewhere like at averages,

1472
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:36,350
Speaker 3:  like way lower. It can do up to 20, 23 or something to

1473
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:40,040
Speaker 3:  that in that zone. But like it bounces around depending on

1474
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:43,580
Speaker 3:  heat and like how full it is and so on, which is what you want.

1475
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:47,860
Speaker 3:  But it never hits the peak that people assumed was 30 Watts because that's

1476
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:51,920
Speaker 3:  charter that they sell it peaks at 23 Watts. So Android authority

1477
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,460
Speaker 3:  like did the testing to verify this. And then Google had to like

1478
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:59,540
Speaker 3:  come out and say, yeah, by the way, this is like,

1479
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:03,320
Speaker 3:  these are the waters. This is how it works. This is why. And they like, they

1480
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:06,260
Speaker 3:  just kinda, they kind of tried to get away with something there and they

1481
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:09,440
Speaker 3:  almost did, but good on Andrew entered authority for doing the testing. They

1482
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,560
Speaker 3:  also put out a software update for the pixels that they said improved the

1483
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,860
Speaker 3:  reliability and perhaps the speed of the fingerprint sensor, a bunch of us

1484
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:19,640
Speaker 3:  have installed it. And I'm fully in the confirmation

1485
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:23,210
Speaker 3:  bias on I'm like, yeah, sure. It's faster. Yeah. I'm sure it's failing

1486
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:25,210
Speaker 3:  less. Yeah, no,

1487
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,810
Speaker 3:  but like bottom line is, it's still not as good as like an S 20. It's still

1488
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:32,480
Speaker 3:  not as good as other, other optical sensors

1489
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:36,320
Speaker 1:  To read on, on pixel six at this moment. Right? This is their back in it.

1490
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:39,890
Speaker 1:  This is our real flagship. Couple of weeks later. How do you think it's gone?

1491
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:44,660
Speaker 3:  I mean, I wish I could say, you know, like it doesn't feel like

1492
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:48,320
Speaker 3:  it's picking up any more momentum than any other pixel to

1493
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,540
Speaker 3:  me in this moment. I think

1494
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,220
Speaker 3:  every single year we're like, well, let's see what the hell, how hard the

1495
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:58,960
Speaker 3:  carriers push it. And like we're coming into black Friday. Let's see how

1496
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:01,730
Speaker 3:  the carriers are pushing the pixel six instead of the iPhone or,

1497
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:05,000
Speaker 1:  And through the holidays. Right? If we see that big marketing push we'll

1498
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,930
Speaker 1:  know, I want to call out two stories here. Katy Keck,

1499
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:12,590
Speaker 1:  our new streaming reporter had an amazing inside look

1500
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:16,790
Speaker 1:  at Netflix, open connect, which is their CDN where they like put

1501
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:20,840
Speaker 1:  their own servers at your ISP. That's why Netflix doesn't go down. I'm

1502
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:24,470
Speaker 1:  a, I'm torn on this. Like I wish the internet was better.

1503
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:29,510
Speaker 1:  It'd be cool if it was, they did it because the internet like between

1504
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:33,230
Speaker 1:  ISP and this country is not that reliable. So just a deep look at like

1505
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:35,750
Speaker 1:  Netflix just solved. It's probably there's built there and infrastructure

1506
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:39,800
Speaker 1:  great piece by Katie. And then Alex Heath, we were talking about meta after

1507
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:43,760
Speaker 1:  all these leaks, the Facebook papers, that consortium that we

1508
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,600
Speaker 1:  were in, all this stuff, Mehta has gone into lockdown and they've

1509
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,560
Speaker 1:  started the culture of that company is changing. You have to ask for access

1510
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:55,280
Speaker 1:  to things in a way that people didn't have to ask for access before.

1511
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:59,270
Speaker 1:  And I think the changing culture of meta Facebook, Instagram, it will have

1512
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:03,090
Speaker 1:  ripple effects, great piece by Alex, lots of inside info on how

1513
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:07,020
Speaker 1:  that company is working in the face of all this pressure and leaks.

1514
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:10,530
Speaker 1:  Okay. We have gone over. It's real.

1515
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:15,570
Speaker 1:  So we're going to get out of here on Tuesday. Dieter did an

1516
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:19,530
Speaker 1:  whole Vergecast on RCS. I did, which was pretty amazing. Yep. Very good.

1517
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,700
Speaker 3:  Coming Tuesday. We're doing another, another episode, which well feature

1518
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,730
Speaker 3:  knee-high we're going to, we're going to air the interview we did with Eero
