00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:06,445
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Good Tweets. I'm your friend,

3
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:10,085
Speaker 2:  David Pierce, and I am currently standing on the casino floor of the

4
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:13,965
Speaker 2:  MGM Grand Casino in Las Vegas. I've been here for the last few days, not

5
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:17,925
Speaker 2:  for the National Rodeo Finals, which was this weekend, or for the NBA in

6
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:21,245
Speaker 2:  season tournament, which was this weekend or for the Raiders game, which

7
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:25,085
Speaker 2:  was this weekend, but for easily the biggest event of all the Microsoft

8
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:28,965
Speaker 2:  Excel World Championships. That's a real thing and it was

9
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:32,725
Speaker 2:  awesome. Basically the idea is a bunch of the world's best spreadsheets get

10
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:35,965
Speaker 2:  together and they spend a couple of days teaching each other how to use Excel

11
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:40,085
Speaker 2:  learning some of the app's, coolest new features, and then they compete.

12
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:43,805
Speaker 2:  They get these incredibly complicated puzzles and they spend hours

13
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:47,445
Speaker 2:  and hours trying to figure out the best, fastest, most

14
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:50,725
Speaker 2:  elaborate, most efficient way to solve these puzzles.

15
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:55,245
Speaker 2:  The competition was actually in the HyperX eSports arena at the Luxor

16
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:57,885
Speaker 2:  Casino. It was a big deal. This is the biggest one of these they've ever

17
00:00:57,885 --> 00:01:01,725
Speaker 2:  done, and I have to say it was pretty dramatic, or at least as dramatic

18
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:05,165
Speaker 2:  as it can be when a bunch of people are sitting on stage doing spreadsheets

19
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,525
Speaker 2:  in ways that you absolutely do not understand and didn't even know people

20
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:11,445
Speaker 2:  could do spreadsheets, but you should watch this thing. It's a few hours

21
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:14,845
Speaker 2:  long, but you can kind of blow through it. The video on YouTube, it's streamed

22
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:18,285
Speaker 2:  on Twitch and on ESPN. I'll link it in the show notes. It was a ton of fun.

23
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:21,885
Speaker 2:  Cannot recommend it enough, and now I'm just basically wandering the casino

24
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:25,245
Speaker 2:  floor, looking for somewhere to lose $20 before I have to go get back on

25
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:28,845
Speaker 2:  the plane. Anyway, we have an awesome show coming up for you today. The verges

26
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:32,285
Speaker 2:  will pour is gonna take us through an adventure he had when he

27
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:35,965
Speaker 2:  rediscovered a 30-year-old computer and tried to figure out what to do with

28
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:39,765
Speaker 2:  it. Then we're gonna talk about Twitter because in a very real way,

29
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:43,805
Speaker 2:  2023 was the year that Twitter died and Diverge just did a big

30
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:47,765
Speaker 2:  package on what it meant and kind of mourning what Twitter once

31
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:51,085
Speaker 2:  was and for all the bad stuff about it, Twitter had some moments. So we're

32
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:53,845
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about what those moments were. It's gonna be a lot of fun. And

33
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:56,405
Speaker 2:  then of course, as we always do, we're gonna get to The Vergecast Hotline

34
00:01:56,535 --> 00:02:00,485
Speaker 2:  Super fun show lot to get to. First I'm gonna go spin the wheel of Fortune

35
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:03,365
Speaker 2:  wheel. Wish me luck. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

36
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:08,405
Speaker 3:  Nearly 24,000 kids had their identity stolen in 2022.

37
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:12,925
Speaker 3:  In the age of social media and phishing schemes, it's more important

38
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,565
Speaker 3:  than ever to protect your family's personal data. Microsoft

39
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:20,325
Speaker 3:  Defender helps keep your personal information safer online with

40
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,725
Speaker 3:  identity theft monitoring for the whole family, giving you real-time

Speaker 3:  3, 6, 5 personal or family subscription.

46
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:51,415
Speaker 2:  Welcome back, All, right, made it home from Vegas for once.

47
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:55,615
Speaker 2:  I didn't get sick on the plane. It's very exciting. Let's get to the show.

48
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:59,845
Speaker 2:  The first thing we have today is a story about the life of vintage computers.

49
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:04,005
Speaker 2:  We talk a lot about right to repair and old gadgets and

50
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:07,925
Speaker 2:  how to extend the shelf life of the gadgets that we rely on, but

51
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:11,565
Speaker 2:  how do you think about that when instead of months and years, you're thinking

52
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:15,485
Speaker 2:  about decades. How much really can you do with

53
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:19,445
Speaker 2:  gadgets to keep them alive much, much longer than you might think?

54
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:23,365
Speaker 2:  That's the question that Verge producer will pour set out to answer. Can

55
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:27,325
Speaker 2:  a 30-year-old Macintosh live on for another 30 years with

56
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:31,205
Speaker 2:  the same parts? If not, what do you need to do to preserve it?

57
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:35,045
Speaker 2:  What does preserving it even mean and what do you lose along the way when

58
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:38,765
Speaker 2:  you do that? I'm gonna let will take over from here and then I'll be back

59
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,605
Speaker 2:  for the second half of the show. Here's Will.

60
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:46,885
Speaker 5:  The first computer my family ever owned is this Apple Mac Classic from

61
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:47,805
Speaker 5:  1991.

62
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:53,965
Speaker 5:  It's an updated riff on the original Macintosh from 1984.

63
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:58,605
Speaker 5:  A cute little all-in-One beige box with a nine inch black and white screen.

64
00:03:59,565 --> 00:04:02,805
Speaker 5:  I spent a lot of time playing with this computer growing up.

65
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:07,365
Speaker 5:  I did my third grade homework on it. I drew for hours in Mac

66
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:11,085
Speaker 5:  Paint and I played glorious games like Rickles and Load

67
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:15,165
Speaker 5:  Runner and Dark Castle. I can still hear the drone of

68
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:19,005
Speaker 5:  the fan, the feel of the keys and the click,

69
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:20,605
Speaker 5:  click, click of the hard drive.

70
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:29,605
Speaker 5:  I asked my parents about the Classic recently and to my delight, they kept

71
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:30,765
Speaker 5:  it for posterity.

72
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:36,685
Speaker 5:  We pulled it out of their attic and miraculously, after 32 years,

73
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:37,885
Speaker 5:  it still works,

74
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,425
Speaker 5:  sort of. It doesn't always boot, and when it does, it makes a

75
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:49,465
Speaker 5:  scary pinging sound that makes me fear for the hard drive.

76
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:55,185
Speaker 5:  I wanted to revisit my homework and games and everything else, but

77
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:59,065
Speaker 5:  I was scared I'd break something and lose it all for good. So I

78
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,825
Speaker 5:  decided to see what it would take to restore an old computer like this one

79
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:06,985
Speaker 5:  to find out what fails in these machines and how to stop it from happening

80
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:11,265
Speaker 5:  so that this little time capsule could survive another 32 years.

81
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:16,145
Speaker 5:  That seems simple enough, but I should have recognized a rabbit hole

82
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:20,025
Speaker 5:  when I saw one. I went deep into the world of vintage computer

83
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:23,625
Speaker 5:  collectors. I learned to solder and I ended up

84
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,105
Speaker 5:  grappling with some big heady questions about the right or

85
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:29,265
Speaker 5:  wrong ways to preserve the past.

86
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:38,265
Speaker 5:  Mac Classic battery replacement.

87
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:44,425
Speaker 5:  The first thing I learned about vintage computer repair is machines of this

88
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:48,425
Speaker 5:  era are time bombs. Many have a little internal battery

89
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:52,105
Speaker 5:  that keeps track of the date and time and as the years roll by

90
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:56,225
Speaker 5:  those batteries love to leak all over the machine's. Innards. Everyone

91
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:59,885
Speaker 5:  I talked to told me to fish that little battery out like yesterday.

92
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:04,845
Speaker 5:  So armed with a bunch of YouTube tutorials, I plop the Mac down on a

93
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:07,805
Speaker 5:  workbench in my garage. Okay, tools,

94
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:12,965
Speaker 5:  this is amateur hour. Luckily the Classic is

95
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:16,805
Speaker 5:  constructed simply enough that I could work with what I had on hand. The

96
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:20,005
Speaker 5:  case is held together with just four standard torque screws.

97
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:21,725
Speaker 5:  Lefty Lucy.

98
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:27,325
Speaker 5:  There it goes. Okay. Once the screws were out, the whole case split

99
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:31,205
Speaker 5:  in half vertically though it took some encouraging. Ouch.

100
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:35,045
Speaker 5:  All, right? I am sliding

101
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:39,845
Speaker 5:  this whole back plastic plate away

102
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:42,885
Speaker 5:  from the computer. And

103
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:47,685
Speaker 5:  ah, inside the components are all jammed densely

104
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:51,805
Speaker 5:  together, which makes disassembly a little touchy. You can get a nasty

105
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:56,045
Speaker 5:  electrical shock off the monitor tube even when the computer is unplugged.

106
00:06:56,345 --> 00:07:00,285
Speaker 5:  My flashlight with some effort, I managed to unplug all

107
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:04,125
Speaker 5:  the little cables connecting to the logic board. Oh, it's sticky and

108
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,805
Speaker 5:  slide it free. The logic board is the brains of the

109
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:11,525
Speaker 5:  computer. It's an unremarkable green rectangle full of circuitry,

110
00:07:11,905 --> 00:07:15,765
Speaker 5:  and there sitting in one corner was the battery. It was easy to

111
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:19,525
Speaker 5:  spot and easier still to pop out of its little cradle and amazingly

112
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:23,445
Speaker 5:  it didn't look leaky at all. It's in good shape. Disaster

113
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:27,445
Speaker 5:  averted, but my work wasn't done. I also learned about the

114
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:31,045
Speaker 5:  handful of capacitors, soldered to the logic board. They're little

115
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:34,285
Speaker 5:  components that hold and release energy to different parts of the computer

116
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:38,645
Speaker 5:  and they can leak and ruin things too. This is where I get outta

117
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:42,485
Speaker 5:  my depth. I don't know what a capacitor looks like. Much less how to

118
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:44,845
Speaker 5:  replace one time to call in the experts.

119
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:53,085
Speaker 5:  I've been driving with this Matt Classic sitting on

120
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,245
Speaker 5:  a towel on the floor of the driver's side.

121
00:07:58,265 --> 00:08:01,965
Speaker 5:  The expert I roped into. This is Jason Perkins. He's an

122
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:05,565
Speaker 5:  information security engineer who lives in a little town about an hour north

123
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:09,445
Speaker 5:  of Seattle. A few weeks ago I found myself pulling up to

124
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:13,125
Speaker 5:  his house with my Matt Classic riding shotgun old

125
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:17,165
Speaker 5:  Ford pickup truck parked next to a Tesla. There

126
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,045
Speaker 5:  is something fitting about that for this story.

127
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:25,205
Speaker 5:  Hey, how's going? Morning, how are ya? Good. Good to see ya. Good to see

128
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:28,685
Speaker 5:  you. I hope you don't mind. I'm recording my journey, trying to be a good

129
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:32,525
Speaker 5:  podcaster. It is an audio podcast, right? I met Jason while working on

130
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:35,805
Speaker 5:  another story about an Apple computer from the eighties called the Lisa.

131
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:40,045
Speaker 5:  He has an extensive collection of vintage tech and when I reached out to

132
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:42,645
Speaker 5:  him about my Mac, he immediately offered to help.

133
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:45,645
Speaker 7:  So this

134
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:46,845
Speaker 5:  Is the workshop plan,

135
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:49,405
Speaker 7:  Converting it into electronics shop. So

136
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:53,205
Speaker 5:  It's been, Jason moved recently, so his home workshop is a bit of a

137
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:57,085
Speaker 5:  mess. Picture a garagey space filled to the brimm with boxes,

138
00:08:57,445 --> 00:09:01,125
Speaker 5:  monitors, wires and tools. But there's a method to the

139
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:05,085
Speaker 5:  madness in one corner. Huge vintage printers sit neatly on

140
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:05,645
Speaker 5:  metal shelves.

141
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:10,445
Speaker 8:  For now, that's printer land. You have to be careful when you put multiple

142
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:14,405
Speaker 8:  laser writers in one spot because the sheer weight can cause

143
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:15,165
Speaker 8:  a black hole.

144
00:09:18,115 --> 00:09:21,725
Speaker 5:  I'll keep my distance. Yeah. Then there are the computers, an

145
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:25,285
Speaker 5:  assortment of diverse systems from the 1980s. There are a few more

146
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:29,605
Speaker 5:  recognizable machines. An Apple, Lisa, a Macintosh se that looks

147
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:33,605
Speaker 5:  a lot like my Classic, but also computers. I'd never heard of

148
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:36,205
Speaker 5:  an NCR PC four.

149
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:40,085
Speaker 8:  This was the first computer that I, that I ever personally had. Somebody

150
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:40,725
Speaker 8:  gave it to me

151
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:42,805
Speaker 5:  A funny little thing called a nabu.

152
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:46,925
Speaker 8:  The keyboard has like a 20 foot cable or something on it. So you'd hook this

153
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:49,925
Speaker 8:  up to your TV in the living room and you'll sit back on the couch.

154
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:51,845
Speaker 5:  A xerox daybreak.

155
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:55,485
Speaker 8:  It actually has an extra card in there with a

156
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:59,325
Speaker 8:  IBM 8 0 180 6 processor on it. So you can have a PC

157
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:03,285
Speaker 8:  emulation in a window with a hardware processor. So you can run PC

158
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:05,125
Speaker 8:  software and Xerox software on

159
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:09,725
Speaker 5:  Just a kaleidoscope of earth tone plastic boxes. You got,

160
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:10,565
Speaker 5:  you've got it up and running

161
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,045
Speaker 8:  It. This is up and running.

162
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:16,405
Speaker 5:  Then there's the telecom collection. A shelf of gleaming

163
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:20,125
Speaker 5:  gloriously analog phones and answering machines from the sixties.

164
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:24,405
Speaker 8:  In the sixties, it was actually a crime to

165
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:28,485
Speaker 8:  connect any equipment not provided by the phone company

166
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:32,445
Speaker 8:  to your telephone line. Oh, so this is an

167
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:36,325
Speaker 8:  answering machine which can pick up the phone, answer it,

168
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:40,405
Speaker 8:  play an announcement, record a message, and hang the phone up with no connection

169
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:41,245
Speaker 8:  to the phone line.

170
00:10:41,615 --> 00:10:45,565
Speaker 5:  Jason is an irrepressible fountain of tech knowledge for

171
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:49,405
Speaker 5:  basically every device we looked at. He gave me the full backstory

172
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:53,405
Speaker 5:  on the product and company, the devices, components, construction,

173
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:57,925
Speaker 5:  hardware, and software quirk. He constantly interrupts himself and digs

174
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,605
Speaker 5:  up new pieces of tech to make a point.

175
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:03,645
Speaker 8:  And I remember actually, I happen to have one. So

176
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:07,365
Speaker 8:  there's no hard drive in this. And so plus development

177
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:11,245
Speaker 8:  developed this thing called the hard card, where it's an expansion

178
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:12,165
Speaker 8:  card with

179
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:16,005
Speaker 5:  A, it's worth noting that all of this machinery is functional.

180
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:17,445
Speaker 5:  The printer's print

181
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:22,485
Speaker 5:  the answering machines pick up and the computer's

182
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:26,765
Speaker 5:  word process. It took a lot of effort to fix this stuff

183
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:30,165
Speaker 5:  up. But for Jason, working devices are the whole point.

184
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:34,485
Speaker 8:  In oh three, the Smithsonian Institution was doing an

185
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:38,245
Speaker 8:  exhibit on history of technology, history of computing. I was so excited

186
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:41,125
Speaker 8:  to go see it and probably one of the most

187
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:45,325
Speaker 8:  disappointing things I've ever experienced in my life actually. 'cause

188
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:49,365
Speaker 8:  we got there and it's like, oh great, there's an original Macintosh

189
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:53,125
Speaker 8:  turned off behind a piece of plexiglass and oh look, there's a xerox

190
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:57,685
Speaker 8:  alto that isn't turned on. And the whole thing's behind flex and glass. It's

191
00:11:57,685 --> 00:12:01,325
Speaker 8:  like you can only admire so many beige rectangles

192
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:05,285
Speaker 8:  before you're like, they just, it's kind of the same thing over and over

193
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:08,245
Speaker 8:  again. That's not what really makes it special. It's,

194
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,845
Speaker 8:  if you go to an art museum, You, don't sit and observe the frame.

195
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:16,685
Speaker 8:  You look at the art like you can, you can look at the art and experience

196
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:19,845
Speaker 8:  the art. If you have a record album, you don't just pick up the record album

197
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:23,445
Speaker 8:  and look at it. You listen to it. And with the technology,

198
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:27,485
Speaker 8:  it's the interaction that is, to me, the big, the big part of it.

199
00:12:29,995 --> 00:12:33,845
Speaker 5:  That idea struck a chord with me. I'm here to

200
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:37,725
Speaker 5:  restore my Mac so that I can do stuff with it again. And remember all the

201
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:41,685
Speaker 5:  fun stuff I did 30 years ago. I'm not a collector, I'm

202
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:42,445
Speaker 5:  just nostalgic.

203
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:48,165
Speaker 5:  After the tour, we got down to business.

204
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:53,845
Speaker 8:  I'm generally pretty good at getting these apart by hand. You just

205
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:56,605
Speaker 8:  kind of tap on it a little bit.

206
00:12:57,415 --> 00:13:01,405
Speaker 5:  Jason dug the logic board outta my Mac and took a closer look and

207
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,085
Speaker 5:  it turns out I'd missed some things.

208
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:07,245
Speaker 8:  So this, the capacitors on this have actually started to leak. Oh yeah. Okay.

209
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:10,805
Speaker 8:  Very slightly. So if you look at this, all these little silver

210
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:13,965
Speaker 8:  cans are the surface mount electrolytic capacitors. Okay.

211
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:17,565
Speaker 5:  Dotted across the surface of the board are these eight little cylindrical

212
00:13:17,635 --> 00:13:19,885
Speaker 5:  objects smaller than an eraser head.

213
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:24,205
Speaker 8:  Do you notice on this chip, this VLSI chip, how there's this line going

214
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:25,325
Speaker 8:  diagonally across.

215
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:29,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's like part of the chip is a little darker colored than the,

216
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:33,205
Speaker 8:  The gunk from this has wafted along and is halfway

217
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:36,725
Speaker 8:  across this chip. Oh no. Cabinets. And that's, you can see it in the dust.

218
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:38,845
Speaker 5:  Oh, I never would've noticed.

219
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:43,165
Speaker 8:  You also notice, see how this chip, all the little solders are nice

220
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:46,965
Speaker 8:  and kind of bright. Yes. And this one they look kind of fuzzy

221
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:50,845
Speaker 8:  and dark gray. Yep. The solders on this had been corroded by

222
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:52,965
Speaker 8:  the leaking capacitor stuff.

223
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:57,005
Speaker 5:  Luckily the damage to the board was minimal. It was just really

224
00:13:57,055 --> 00:14:00,805
Speaker 5:  dirty. Jason walked me through the process of cleaning up the mess and installing

225
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:04,285
Speaker 5:  new capacitors. Step one, remove the old ones.

226
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:08,605
Speaker 8:  So we're gonna take a a sharp pair of

227
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:12,605
Speaker 8:  cutters. Okay. And we're just gonna cut this thing off.

228
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:17,245
Speaker 8:  And the danger here is it does go flying. Okay. So watch your eyes slightly,

229
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:18,605
Speaker 8:  but we'll just, you know, covering my

230
00:14:18,605 --> 00:14:21,525
Speaker 5:  Eyes and, oops. Okay. We've just snipped,

231
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:22,405
Speaker 8:  Snipped it

232
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:26,325
Speaker 5:  Off. Step two, clean the logic board. I figured we'd

233
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:29,925
Speaker 5:  use some special solvent, but we just went to the kitchen and ran the whole

234
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:33,765
Speaker 5:  board under hot water. It turns out that water doesn't hurt circuit

235
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:36,405
Speaker 5:  boards at all. As long as they're not plugged in while they're wet.

236
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:40,085
Speaker 8:  Some regular dish soap. And I've got a toothbrush

237
00:14:42,705 --> 00:14:44,285
Speaker 8:  and we're gonna scrubby, scrubby, scrubby.

238
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:47,925
Speaker 5:  Step three, blow dry the board to get all the moisture out.

239
00:14:48,265 --> 00:14:52,005
Speaker 8:  So now I've just got a regular, just a little air compressor. I'm gonna blow

240
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:54,205
Speaker 8:  this off. So this'll be probably kind of loud

241
00:14:56,945 --> 00:15:00,805
Speaker 5:  To the extra. Sure. The board was dry, we just left it in the sun and went

242
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:04,285
Speaker 5:  to lunch. After that we were finally ready to solder on the new

243
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:04,885
Speaker 5:  capacitors.

244
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:09,445
Speaker 8:  I'm gonna solder this guy right here. This thing. Oh, okay. So you

245
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:12,645
Speaker 8:  see we've got the two leads sticking out. Yep. I'm gonna clean the tip of

246
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,525
Speaker 8:  my iron first and the scrubby thing. That's nice and shiny. Now when I

247
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:20,005
Speaker 8:  put the solder on here, we'll see. Watch what happens. Do you see how it's

248
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:23,925
Speaker 8:  flowing all across the pad? It's not flowed onto the wire yet. There's

249
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:27,885
Speaker 8:  not enough solder. So as I continue to add now, do

250
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,085
Speaker 8:  you see how it's like flowed up the wire a little bit and

251
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:32,325
Speaker 5:  It makes that Yeah, it's being pulled up. Yeah.

252
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:36,445
Speaker 8:  That acid cleans the surface and it makes the solder

253
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:36,725
Speaker 8:  stick.

254
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:41,365
Speaker 5:  It's super fiddly work holding the new capacitor gently with

255
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:45,205
Speaker 5:  some forceps. I placed it as precisely as possible on

256
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:47,165
Speaker 5:  the little pad where the old one was.

257
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:51,245
Speaker 8:  Notice too, how each can, there's like a black

258
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:55,405
Speaker 8:  side. Yes. A little black stripe. That's the negative side. Okay.

259
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:59,365
Speaker 8:  Notice helpfully on the circuit board there's a plus Yes. On

260
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:03,045
Speaker 8:  each one of these. The orientation is very important. I see. If you install

261
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,565
Speaker 8:  them backwards, they explode. Gotcha.

262
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:09,245
Speaker 5:  Then I went in with the soldering iron and melted fresh solder around

263
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:13,125
Speaker 5:  the tiny little capacitor. Okay, so I'm gonna nudge this capacitor.

264
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:13,725
Speaker 5:  You're

265
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:13,885
Speaker 8:  Pretty

266
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:17,325
Speaker 5:  Close into as close a place as possible. Boop.

267
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:20,445
Speaker 8:  That looks good. You smell that fish fishy smell. I was

268
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:21,285
Speaker 5:  Gonna ask about that.

269
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,685
Speaker 8:  That is the capacitor oil. Okay. It smells like fishes.

270
00:16:24,955 --> 00:16:28,725
Speaker 5:  Okay. I didn't trust myself. I was like, there's no way I smelled seafood

271
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:29,085
Speaker 5:  right

272
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:32,445
Speaker 8:  Now. You absolutely do that. That is the smell of

273
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:34,565
Speaker 8:  leaked capacitors. Leaked

274
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:38,485
Speaker 5:  Capacitors smell like fish. Yes. If I take nothing else away from this

275
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:42,405
Speaker 5:  entire project, I will have learned that it

276
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:45,845
Speaker 5:  was easy enough once I got the hang of it and a few minutes later we were

277
00:16:45,845 --> 00:16:49,325
Speaker 5:  done. Eight new capacitors on a sparkly clean circuit board.

278
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:52,925
Speaker 5:  We slid the board back into the computer and put everything back together.

279
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:57,085
Speaker 8:  The next step is the smoke test. You plug it in and see if it smokes.

280
00:16:57,665 --> 00:16:58,365
Speaker 8:  You think I'm joking?

281
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:03,165
Speaker 5:  Some of the capacitors we replaced help power the speaker. So we hope

282
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:06,925
Speaker 5:  we might get one of those iconic max startup chimes when we flip the switch

283
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:11,885
Speaker 5:  and moment of truth. A complete computer.

284
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:13,285
Speaker 8:  No bong.

285
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,205
Speaker 5:  No bong

286
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:17,005
Speaker 8:  Mwo but no smoke.

287
00:17:17,555 --> 00:17:21,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I'll take it. Mission largely

288
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:21,725
Speaker 5:  accomplished.

289
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:26,205
Speaker 8:  You'll notice this time it's gonna stay on this screen a little bit longer

290
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:30,405
Speaker 8:  'cause we have more memory. So this pattern is what it does while it's testing

291
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,085
Speaker 8:  the memory. Mm.

292
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:35,165
Speaker 5:  After all that work, I had a feeling of satisfaction that only

293
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:39,165
Speaker 5:  newbies get. I did a thing, it didn't break. I

294
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:42,605
Speaker 5:  felt like we did what I came to do. So this computer is immortal now. Right?

295
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:44,405
Speaker 5:  You can see where this is going.

296
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:50,205
Speaker 5:  So without messing with it anymore, now that we've fixed

297
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:54,245
Speaker 5:  the, the things that we know are problems, if you had to guess how

298
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:57,685
Speaker 5:  much longer this Classic would last for after

299
00:17:58,395 --> 00:18:01,845
Speaker 5:  what is now what, 32 or so years,

300
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:03,045
Speaker 5:  what would you say?

301
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:07,565
Speaker 8:  The next thing to fail will be? The hard drive. I can show you

302
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:10,805
Speaker 8:  why and then we can describe it. I just happen to have

303
00:18:11,395 --> 00:18:15,085
Speaker 8:  another quantum prodrive that I was monkeying with.

304
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:19,205
Speaker 8:  So this is gonna get a little bit into hard drive theory

305
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:23,645
Speaker 5:  Here. Jason gets very Jason again in a nutshell, some

306
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:27,045
Speaker 5:  rubber inside the drive will eventually turn to goo.

307
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:31,325
Speaker 5:  Also, the drive will slowly demagnetize degrading the data.

308
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:35,245
Speaker 5:  The point is, this hard drive could die at any moment

309
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:39,885
Speaker 5:  and when it does, it could take all my digital memories with it. So if

310
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,085
Speaker 5:  my goal is preservation, I've got more work to do.

311
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:48,085
Speaker 8:  Probably the best long-term method would be to they, they make hard drive

312
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,485
Speaker 8:  replacements now that use an SD card. Well you install the SSD card on this,

313
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:55,445
Speaker 8:  this special converter that to the computer looks like a scuzzy hard drive.

314
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:59,525
Speaker 8:  Okay. And so it's like within the SD card there's this enclave

315
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:03,205
Speaker 8:  that is pretending to be, you know, a scuzzy hard drive.

316
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:04,845
Speaker 5:  A hard drive from 1991. Yeah.

317
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,325
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And the computer is essentially none the wiser.

318
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:11,685
Speaker 5:  That sounded intimidating technically, but there was something else.

319
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:12,645
Speaker 5:  Tripping me up.

320
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:18,765
Speaker 5:  If the whole point of this exercise is to recreate the experience

321
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:22,565
Speaker 5:  of using this computer in 1991, what

322
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:25,765
Speaker 5:  happens to that experience when you start making larger changes?

323
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,525
Speaker 5:  Part of what I remember about this computer is hearing the hard drive

324
00:19:30,715 --> 00:19:34,565
Speaker 5:  spin up and were, if I replace it with a little SD card,

325
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:38,565
Speaker 5:  I'll have preserved most of that experience. But will I have

326
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:39,765
Speaker 5:  preserved the computer?

327
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:45,645
Speaker 5:  Jason unsurprisingly, has spent a lot of time with these questions.

328
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:50,285
Speaker 5:  When does preservation become enhancement? What counts as

329
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:52,125
Speaker 5:  authentic or original?

330
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:55,965
Speaker 8:  Well, I, I like having as much original

331
00:19:56,605 --> 00:20:00,165
Speaker 8:  hardware as I can. Even if it's like, you know, maybe slightly newer

332
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:04,285
Speaker 8:  but still like an upgrade compared to what it was when it was new. I like

333
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:07,205
Speaker 8:  doing that. Some people like really into that. Like, oh, I'll get all these

334
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:10,725
Speaker 8:  new boards and like build the whole thing from scratch and it's, that's really

335
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:14,445
Speaker 8:  neat, you know? But it's not, I guess that's not what my personal thing is.

336
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:14,925
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

337
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:16,085
Speaker 5:  What's different about that to you?

338
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:20,725
Speaker 8:  You know, one of my friends actually just built a new Lisa,

339
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:24,845
Speaker 8:  like new circuit boards 'cause people have come up with his

340
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:28,525
Speaker 8:  schematics and has made himself a a a Lisa from Ether. Yeah. Yeah.

341
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:32,685
Speaker 8:  And it's really cool. Me personally, that's not the kind of project

342
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:34,685
Speaker 8:  that I would set out on.

343
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:39,365
Speaker 5:  Do you think for you it's the sort of like top down

344
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:43,325
Speaker 5:  taking something that exists and maintaining it and tweaking it

345
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:45,245
Speaker 5:  versus the bottom up?

346
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:49,525
Speaker 8:  I think it is, yeah. That I enjoy more of the top down of this

347
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:53,165
Speaker 8:  worked. At one point I should be able to make it work just like it did. Again,

348
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,685
Speaker 8:  let's say you take a car from the sixties and now you've like, you replace

349
00:20:56,905 --> 00:21:00,765
Speaker 8:  all the suspension and the running gear and the engine and the transmission

350
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:04,565
Speaker 8:  with all brand new stuff. It's like, okay, it's really nice and some of this

351
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:08,205
Speaker 8:  stuff is just so expertly done. But do you, is it

352
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:12,165
Speaker 8:  really still the, is it the original car at that point? Like

353
00:21:12,225 --> 00:21:15,885
Speaker 8:  if you've replaced everything that makes it function with something new,

354
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:19,645
Speaker 5:  There's that, what you're describing with it's the ship Ethe. It's ship

355
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:20,805
Speaker 5:  Ephesus. Right? Right.

356
00:21:23,185 --> 00:21:26,925
Speaker 5:  The Ship SIUs is a paradox that philosophers have been arguing

357
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:30,885
Speaker 5:  about for 2000 years. Basically, there's this famous

358
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,885
Speaker 5:  ship once sailed by the Greek adventurer SIUs. His fans

359
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:38,605
Speaker 5:  pledged to preserve the ship forever by replacing any plank that

360
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:42,485
Speaker 5:  rots out, which is great. but it begs the question, when

361
00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:46,245
Speaker 5:  all the planks eventually get replaced, is it the same ship

362
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:50,205
Speaker 5:  anymore? What exactly is being preserved? What makes the ship

363
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:54,005
Speaker 5:  the ship being a paradox? There's no clear

364
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:57,805
Speaker 5:  answer. And for my Mac Classic, the thought experiment only gets weirder.

365
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:02,165
Speaker 5:  Adding an SD card would be like fitting the ship of SS with an

366
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:02,965
Speaker 5:  outboard motor.

367
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:09,485
Speaker 5:  Adding modern components also starts to blur the line

368
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:13,445
Speaker 5:  between restoration and modding. And that's where things really

369
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:13,965
Speaker 5:  get wild.

370
00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:18,085
Speaker 10:  Welcome To, the Mac Classic remodel build in which you'll witness the process

371
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:21,685
Speaker 10:  it took to convert an old Mac into a modernized pc.

372
00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:22,725
Speaker 10:  This video has

373
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,925
Speaker 5:  Click around YouTube or Reddit and you'll find mods swapping vintage

374
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:29,285
Speaker 5:  and modern parts with abandon an

375
00:22:29,285 --> 00:22:33,045
Speaker 11:  Obscenely upgraded Macintosh SE 30 in a clear case.

376
00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:37,245
Speaker 5:  One listener reached out to show us their heavily moed first generation

377
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:41,285
Speaker 5:  Macintosh. It's got an iPad for a screen and

378
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:45,205
Speaker 5:  runs a vintage OSS alongside a doc and FaceTime

379
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:45,725
Speaker 5:  So

380
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:49,605
Speaker 12:  I built a custom system that brings the power of apple silicon to this

381
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:51,765
Speaker 12:  iconic design in a magical way.

382
00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:55,805
Speaker 5:  And it is a long way from a Mac Classic with an SSD card in it.

383
00:22:56,215 --> 00:23:00,125
Speaker 5:  Jason appreciates the more inventive creations as long as Moders

384
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,765
Speaker 5:  don't destroy working vintage hardware along the way.

385
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:07,085
Speaker 8:  I definitely don't have a problem with it. I think it's just a preference

386
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,805
Speaker 8:  of I've managed to accumulate enough crap over the years that Yeah,

387
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:14,605
Speaker 8:  or it's the challenge of finding the original one or getting the original

388
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:16,725
Speaker 8:  one going again. It's the fun of the search.

389
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:20,565
Speaker 5:  That said, he sees debates play out on forums all the time.

390
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:25,085
Speaker 8:  Oh you know, it's kind of the typical, geez, am I gonna date

391
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:28,005
Speaker 8:  myself if I use the term flame war? But

392
00:23:28,955 --> 00:23:29,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

393
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:33,365
Speaker 8:  Yeah, yeah. Well people in technology tend to have strongly held opinions.

394
00:23:34,485 --> 00:23:38,005
Speaker 5:  Ultimately, Jason's just glad that these computers are still out there for

395
00:23:38,005 --> 00:23:41,885
Speaker 5:  people to play with and fix up and argue over. It shows in

396
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:45,785
Speaker 5:  the care he's put into his own collection and in the hours he was happy to

397
00:23:45,785 --> 00:23:49,705
Speaker 5:  spend with me. It takes a lot to preserve the experience of

398
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:53,625
Speaker 5:  vintage computing and even then, this stuff is not gonna last

399
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:57,305
Speaker 5:  forever. But clearly Jason thinks it's worth the effort anyway,

400
00:23:57,885 --> 00:24:01,425
Speaker 8:  All these things that we create reflect us as a society, as people,

401
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:05,665
Speaker 8:  and it's valuable. People put a lot of time and effort into

402
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:09,505
Speaker 8:  creating these things. You know it to conjure this thing

403
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:13,585
Speaker 8:  from nothing that does something now, like that's you, you had, you had to

404
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,985
Speaker 8:  picture that before it existed. That's, that's pretty cool. And

405
00:24:17,435 --> 00:24:21,345
Speaker 8:  being able to continue to display or interact

406
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:25,185
Speaker 8:  with that creation gives it value. And if instead

407
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:28,625
Speaker 8:  it is locked away and forgotten about,

408
00:24:29,365 --> 00:24:33,345
Speaker 8:  we lose that value. You know, it just like if you couldn't read

409
00:24:33,345 --> 00:24:36,945
Speaker 8:  books that were 20 years old. I think it's a problem that historians in the

410
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:39,185
Speaker 8:  future are gonna be really ringing their hands about.

411
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:46,305
Speaker 5:  After chatting with Jason, a small irony occurred to me.

412
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:50,705
Speaker 5:  Those historians may have a much harder time preserving newer

413
00:24:51,105 --> 00:24:54,705
Speaker 5:  computers. My old Mac Classic was a breeze to repair,

414
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:58,625
Speaker 5:  which enables a whole ecosystem of amateurs like me to learn

415
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:03,065
Speaker 5:  and tinker and keep these systems alive. Whereas my

416
00:25:03,065 --> 00:25:06,945
Speaker 5:  2019 MacBook Pro is rocking a one out

417
00:25:06,945 --> 00:25:10,665
Speaker 5:  of 10 on, I fix its repairability meter. It is a lot

418
00:25:10,665 --> 00:25:14,465
Speaker 5:  more complex and miniaturized and openly hostile to

419
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:18,025
Speaker 5:  tinkering. I'd need to deal with glue and rivets

420
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:21,385
Speaker 5:  and a lot more solder to pull off any significant repair.

421
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:25,865
Speaker 5:  Also, I'd need something called a ger and I do not care to learn

422
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:29,545
Speaker 5:  what that is. The point is, whatever memories I have

423
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:33,585
Speaker 5:  that are tied to newer computers, those will probably die with the hardware

424
00:25:37,895 --> 00:25:40,065
Speaker 5:  back at home. I fired up the Mac Classic,

425
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:47,105
Speaker 5:  it booted great. I used an external speaker for the sound and

426
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:49,265
Speaker 5:  I finally got to just sit down and explore.

427
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,425
Speaker 13:  There is a document that is just called The Cat,

428
00:25:54,445 --> 00:25:57,865
Speaker 13:  and that is, it's just a drawing of a cat

429
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:03,445
Speaker 13:  with a title that says the cat gonna click

430
00:26:03,465 --> 00:26:04,925
Speaker 13:  on octopus picture.

431
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:11,845
Speaker 13:  That was so patient as a 10-year-old. This computer is

432
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:12,485
Speaker 13:  so slow.

433
00:26:14,525 --> 00:26:18,325
Speaker 5:  I found tons of drawings. It reminded me how much I used to love drawing

434
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:22,605
Speaker 5:  lots of homework too. There's this really sweet interview with my grandpa

435
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:25,645
Speaker 5:  that I did when I was 10 and the games

436
00:26:26,515 --> 00:26:29,925
Speaker 13:  Load runner, my gosh, load runner is the best.

437
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:36,365
Speaker 13:  God. Somehow I remembered the controls

438
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:38,925
Speaker 13:  without having to think twice about it.

439
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:45,405
Speaker 13:  All, right? I just need to beat this level and then I'll finish this

440
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:46,165
Speaker 13:  podcast segment.

441
00:26:56,535 --> 00:27:00,085
Speaker 5:  After spending all this time with the computer, I agree with Jason.

442
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:04,725
Speaker 5:  What makes this thing valuable is not the beige box or the

443
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:08,885
Speaker 5:  software or documents inside of it. It's everything working in concert

444
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:12,885
Speaker 5:  like it did 30 years ago. That's what makes it a time machine.

445
00:27:13,785 --> 00:27:17,725
Speaker 5:  So I'm not gonna mess with it too much more. I'm gonna follow Jason's advice

446
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:21,725
Speaker 5:  and swap the hard drive out for an SD card that'll keep things running

447
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:25,365
Speaker 5:  for a little while. But that's it. I've replaced enough

448
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:28,885
Speaker 5:  planks on this ship for a few more voyages. After that,

449
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:30,445
Speaker 5:  the sea can reclaim it.

450
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:32,205
Speaker 13:  They're fun.

451
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:36,045
Speaker 13:  Shut down.

452
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:48,605
Speaker 2:  We gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna talk

453
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:50,005
Speaker 2:  about Twitter. We'll be right back.

454
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:10,365
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. This week, The Verge published a whole bunch of stories about

455
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:14,005
Speaker 2:  the fall of Twitter collected into a series we're calling The year.

456
00:29:14,005 --> 00:29:17,765
Speaker 2:  Twitter died. You should go read all of them. They're really great

457
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:21,605
Speaker 2:  stories and the art to go along with them is like deranged

458
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:25,445
Speaker 2:  in the best possible way. It's one of the most fun things we've had on The

459
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:28,245
Speaker 2:  Verge all year. I really encourage you to go check it out. We'll link it

460
00:29:28,245 --> 00:29:31,845
Speaker 2:  in the show notes. But today on the show I wanna talk more about what Twitter

461
00:29:32,225 --> 00:29:36,165
Speaker 2:  was, which is a weird way to think about it. I know, but I think as

462
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:40,045
Speaker 2:  we get some hindsight from this weird website that we spent

463
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:44,125
Speaker 2:  so many hours staring at and talking about and that felt so central

464
00:29:44,505 --> 00:29:48,485
Speaker 2:  to life and culture for so many people for so long. I think

465
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:52,085
Speaker 2:  we're getting a little closer to figuring it out. And as Twitter becomes

466
00:29:52,245 --> 00:29:56,205
Speaker 2:  X, which becomes something else, I think now is a good time to talk about

467
00:29:56,395 --> 00:30:00,205
Speaker 2:  what Twitter meant to us for so long. So Nila Patel and Alex

468
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:03,845
Speaker 2:  Cranz, my co-hosts are here to pour one out for the Twitter that used to

469
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,565
Speaker 2:  be Neli. Hello.

470
00:30:05,935 --> 00:30:06,285
Speaker 17:  Hello.

471
00:30:06,755 --> 00:30:10,165
Speaker 2:  Alex. Cranz not wearing glasses and squinting. I wish everyone could see

472
00:30:10,165 --> 00:30:11,605
Speaker 2:  the face Alex is making right now.

473
00:30:11,905 --> 00:30:15,085
Speaker 18:  Am I squinting really badly? Yes, it's blur. So

474
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:18,645
Speaker 2:  We're, we're here to talk about Twitter and I, I say Twitter very specifically

475
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:23,005
Speaker 2:  because Twitter ends at the day of a certain acquisition. We're not

476
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:26,045
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about that. We spent a lot of time over this last year talking

477
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:28,925
Speaker 2:  about like what Twitter was and what it meant. We had this big package and

478
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:31,565
Speaker 2:  Nila, you wrote a story, but I realized the first thing I wanna talk about

479
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:34,125
Speaker 2:  because I was thinking like, what is, when I think of Twitter, what's the

480
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:37,365
Speaker 2:  first thing that comes to mind? And I wanna know from both of you, what was

481
00:30:37,365 --> 00:30:41,285
Speaker 2:  the closest you ever got to being the main character on Twitter? For good

482
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:44,485
Speaker 2:  reasons or bad reasons? Like what was the biggest moment you ever had on

483
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:46,285
Speaker 2:  Twitter? Neli? I wanna hear yours first.

484
00:30:46,865 --> 00:30:47,765
Speaker 17:  All of mine are bad.

485
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:48,485
Speaker 18:  Okay.

486
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:52,485
Speaker 17:  Same. You know, I'm the editor of a thing, like anything goes wrong

487
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:55,405
Speaker 17:  and it's my fault. Which is fine. That's the job. That's what the money's

488
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:58,725
Speaker 17:  for. But when you're like, what is the closest you've come to being the

489
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:01,485
Speaker 17:  main character? It's like the Apple Watch review. Ooh,

490
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:03,365
Speaker 2:  Ooh. The original Apple Watch

491
00:31:03,365 --> 00:31:07,125
Speaker 17:  People got really mad at me 'cause I said the, what was it? The Meese

492
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,965
Speaker 17:  loop. I was like, this shit's fussy for old people. And then everyone tweeted

493
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:13,925
Speaker 17:  pictures of my spiky bracelet and it's like, yeah dude, I'm that, I'm that

494
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,925
Speaker 17:  I'm that person, not your dad.

495
00:31:18,305 --> 00:31:21,365
Speaker 17:  Go away, get in your Rolls Royce and drive away from my face.

496
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:24,165
Speaker 18:  Do you have a spiky bracelet? Apple Watch band?

497
00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:27,965
Speaker 17:  I don't, no one's ever gotten me one. I would welcome one. Send me one without

498
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:30,605
Speaker 17:  any weird powders in the envelope and I'll happily wear it.

499
00:31:30,825 --> 00:31:34,285
Speaker 18:  I'm just so excited to learn this. This just made my gift giving a lot easier.

500
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:34,725
Speaker 18:  Thank you

501
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:36,245
Speaker 17:  For, for the man who has everything.

502
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:36,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

503
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:41,045
Speaker 17:  There, I mean there's other ones like any minor scandal that we've

504
00:31:41,045 --> 00:31:44,565
Speaker 17:  had. Like the thing that I will just take out of this without listing

505
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:47,845
Speaker 17:  every scandal, The Verge has ever had. You asked me that question and all

506
00:31:47,845 --> 00:31:51,765
Speaker 17:  of my instincts were negative. Mm. There's a flip side

507
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:55,645
Speaker 17:  to this, right? When we were covering Apple versus Samsung,

508
00:31:56,385 --> 00:32:00,205
Speaker 17:  we were in the center of that coverage of that trial. And I was writing

509
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:04,205
Speaker 17:  patent explainers with Matt McCarry, a patent lawyer that we'd put

510
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:08,125
Speaker 17:  on staff for the period of that trial. And we were the center of

511
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:12,005
Speaker 17:  that conver and that was a really positive experience that made our careers,

512
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:15,365
Speaker 17:  it made the early part of The Verge like a very real way. But when you ask

513
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:18,325
Speaker 17:  me a question, it's like, when were you the main character? My immediate

514
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:19,725
Speaker 17:  instinct is negative.

515
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:22,445
Speaker 2:  That's fair. Cranz, what about you? Do you have a happy story?

516
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:27,485
Speaker 18:  Hmm. No. Hmm. No. 'cause the, the the times I was a

517
00:32:27,765 --> 00:32:30,965
Speaker 18:  main character, it was usually like the time I got in a fight with, oh no,

518
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:34,405
Speaker 18:  they didn't. And that was, that was fun.

519
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:38,365
Speaker 18:  Okay. In the time that like Tucker Carlson used one of my

520
00:32:38,365 --> 00:32:41,965
Speaker 18:  tweets and put it in his thing being like the liberal journalist. Oh

521
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:43,845
Speaker 18:  that was, that was fun.

522
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:45,805
Speaker 2:  A true rite of passage on Twitter.

523
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:48,845
Speaker 17:  And Cranz was like, these Netflix prices are outta control. And Tucker Carlson

524
00:32:48,845 --> 00:32:49,365
Speaker 17:  was like, these

525
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:52,085
Speaker 2:  Liberals, this is why millennials can't buy houses.

526
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,365
Speaker 18:  Don't tweet on vacation is what I learned. But there was one time I had

527
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:58,125
Speaker 18:  to make, like, when I left my last job, I made a big announcement on Twitter

528
00:32:58,345 --> 00:33:01,205
Speaker 18:  and, and that was actually like really nice 'cause I got tons of people

529
00:33:01,265 --> 00:33:04,565
Speaker 18:  I'd never even heard of. Like tons of like big folks in tech and everybody

530
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,685
Speaker 18:  just being like, you're awesome. And it was just like an enormous morale

531
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:11,645
Speaker 18:  boost and it was just instant. Like just that that dopamine hit was so fast.

532
00:33:11,805 --> 00:33:15,765
Speaker 18:  I was like, oh, okay, Twitter is good. And then like, but that was like

533
00:33:15,845 --> 00:33:19,365
Speaker 18:  2020 So I. I was like late to the party when it comes to having like really

534
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:21,485
Speaker 18:  good Twitter experiences like that.

535
00:33:21,755 --> 00:33:24,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Personal news Twitter I think was like consistently one of the best

536
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:28,125
Speaker 2:  things on Twitter. Yes. The like somebody gets a new job,

537
00:33:28,545 --> 00:33:32,245
Speaker 2:  leaves a job, changes careers, whatever. And it was just like a random

538
00:33:32,255 --> 00:33:35,805
Speaker 2:  outpouring of enthusiasm every single time. It was great. Yeah. I I

539
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:39,405
Speaker 2:  congratulated so many strangers on new jobs. Same. I loved it. You're

540
00:33:39,405 --> 00:33:42,365
Speaker 17:  Gonna be great. Yeah. We launched the entire Verge in the back of Twitter

541
00:33:42,365 --> 00:33:46,205
Speaker 17:  in like a real way. We had the End Gadget podcast and then we all quit a

542
00:33:46,205 --> 00:33:50,005
Speaker 17:  OL in a moment for blogging that will probably never be recreated. Like

543
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:54,725
Speaker 17:  national news, bunch of gadget blockers leave a OL Yeah.

544
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:58,685
Speaker 17:  This was in the New York Times. Yeah. We took our audience with us

545
00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:01,805
Speaker 17:  because we had the big podcast audience. It's now this show

546
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:06,325
Speaker 17:  and we communicated to all of them about what we were doing and where we

547
00:34:06,325 --> 00:34:10,045
Speaker 17:  were going on Twitter and that, you know, that's a core

548
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:13,725
Speaker 17:  memory. That's a thing that we did that was not su no one could do

549
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:17,645
Speaker 17:  before these tools existed in that way. And so yeah, I I have

550
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:21,405
Speaker 17:  these happy memories like outpourings of affection.

551
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:25,405
Speaker 17:  But when you say main character, my mind leaps to the goal is to

552
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:26,485
Speaker 17:  not be the main character.

553
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:27,085
Speaker 2:  Yes.

554
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:30,525
Speaker 18:  Yeah. You never like main character in a romance novel. Cool.

555
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,485
Speaker 18:  Main character on Twitter Bad.

556
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:36,445
Speaker 2:  That's fair. The closest I ever got was in I think 2021.

557
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:40,645
Speaker 2:  Nicki Minaj tweeted angrily at me thinking she was tweeting angrily at Pi

558
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:40,965
Speaker 2:  Morgan.

559
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:42,005
Speaker 17:  That's pretty good.

560
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:46,445
Speaker 2:  I got don don't know 10,000 replies that day from

561
00:34:46,445 --> 00:34:50,285
Speaker 2:  people who were mad at me. And then there was,

562
00:34:50,285 --> 00:34:53,405
Speaker 2:  there was somebody who tweeted at Nikki that was like, leave this poor nerd

563
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:57,285
Speaker 2:  child alone. He didn't do this. And then Nikki apologized to

564
00:34:57,285 --> 00:35:00,925
Speaker 2:  me again on Twitter and So I got a bunch more replies and, and it was just

565
00:35:00,925 --> 00:35:04,685
Speaker 2:  like I became, I became one of the Barbs, which is Nikki's fans. And so it

566
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,565
Speaker 2:  was, it was, it was a lovely moment. They were very mad at me for like an

567
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:11,525
Speaker 2:  hour and then they were very nice to me after that. I still get dms from

568
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:14,645
Speaker 2:  people who are like, who are like, what did you do to Nicki? And I'm like,

569
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:15,845
Speaker 2:  I didn't do anything. I'm really sorry.

570
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:20,365
Speaker 17:  Being mistaken for Pierce Morgan. That's bad dude. It's

571
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:21,005
Speaker 18:  Like, that's just bad.

572
00:35:21,115 --> 00:35:24,005
Speaker 2:  It's the worst. The single worst thing about Twitter has been like, I got

573
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:27,965
Speaker 2:  a very good Twitter handle. I was at Pierce on Twitter. So when you

574
00:35:27,965 --> 00:35:31,205
Speaker 2:  type at PIER because you wanna be mad at Pierce Morgan,

575
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:35,685
Speaker 2:  there was a non-zero chance that my name would be the first thing that came

576
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:39,605
Speaker 2:  up. So like every few days somebody would get extremely

577
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:43,485
Speaker 2:  mad at Pi Morgan in my mentions. And I

578
00:35:43,485 --> 00:35:44,405
Speaker 2:  do not miss that at all.

579
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:45,325
Speaker 17:  That's really funny.

580
00:35:46,225 --> 00:35:48,805
Speaker 2:  The thing that I've been trying to reckon with over the course of the last

581
00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:52,205
Speaker 2:  year or so, and like, I basically stopped tweeting when I went on

582
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:56,325
Speaker 2:  parental leave. So this is like almost exactly a year ago. I was

583
00:35:56,325 --> 00:36:00,245
Speaker 2:  just like, gonna stop with social media for a while, gonna not post on

584
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:03,485
Speaker 2:  the internet, gonna go like be a dad on parental leave for a few months.

585
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:06,205
Speaker 2:  And I was like, I'll come back. It'll all be the same. Everything will be

586
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,645
Speaker 2:  fine. And I haven't tweeted since and I haven't missed it at all. And so

587
00:36:08,645 --> 00:36:12,605
Speaker 2:  I've spent this year like trying to figure out why Twitter

588
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:16,605
Speaker 2:  was so central in my life and then what changed and why it went away. But

589
00:36:16,835 --> 00:36:20,405
Speaker 2:  Neli, you wrote this piece this week reckoning with that at like the big

590
00:36:20,405 --> 00:36:24,005
Speaker 2:  level, which is like we as reporters I think were the people like

591
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:27,165
Speaker 2:  most obsessed with Twitter as a single group of people.

592
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:30,645
Speaker 2:  And you asked around to talk to a hundred people. Do you have like a unified

593
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:34,005
Speaker 2:  theory of what Twitter did to us as journalists?

594
00:36:34,465 --> 00:36:37,405
Speaker 17:  It gave us a direct connection to an audience in a way that no other platform

595
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:40,485
Speaker 17:  has ever done. Even the ones now that seem like they have a more direct

596
00:36:40,485 --> 00:36:44,405
Speaker 17:  connection, like TikTok or whatever, there's still artifice there. Twitter

597
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:48,365
Speaker 17:  was you type, you hit the button, maybe some people will yell at you and

598
00:36:48,365 --> 00:36:51,845
Speaker 17:  come back to you. You could work out an idea in public. A lot of reporters

599
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:55,565
Speaker 17:  built their brands by just firing half cocked ideas out

600
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:59,365
Speaker 17:  into the world and then working them out and then publishing

601
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:02,845
Speaker 17:  the, the fully cocked idea, which maybe nobody even ever read, but the process

602
00:37:02,945 --> 00:37:06,885
Speaker 17:  of the journalism, like built a brand for people or the ability to

603
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:10,565
Speaker 17:  immediately synthesize and react built the brand for people. And

604
00:37:10,705 --> 00:37:14,685
Speaker 17:  the more I think about what that did to our ability to think,

605
00:37:15,385 --> 00:37:17,365
Speaker 17:  the more I think that we should stop it.

606
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:22,845
Speaker 17:  Like, and may, maybe that is me just being old and Crochety. But you know,

607
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:25,365
Speaker 17:  I talked to Ezra Klein who obviously founded Vox and is not the New York

608
00:37:25,365 --> 00:37:29,325
Speaker 17:  Times. I talked to Ben Smith who founded Buzzfeed News and

609
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:32,205
Speaker 17:  now runs Semaphore. Previously the New York Times. I talked to Corey Zika

610
00:37:32,345 --> 00:37:35,445
Speaker 17:  New York magazine previously the New York Times. I talked to Lydia Paul Green,

611
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:39,125
Speaker 17:  who was the editor-in-chief of Hogan Post now at the New York Times. I maybe

612
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,005
Speaker 17:  you can see a trend here.

613
00:37:40,235 --> 00:37:43,165
Speaker 2:  It's also very funny by the way that all of those people are like big deal

614
00:37:43,165 --> 00:37:46,965
Speaker 2:  media executives now. And I, all of them were like

615
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:51,325
Speaker 2:  OG Twitter stars. Exactly. Yeah. Like if you rewind 10 years ago, they were

616
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:53,725
Speaker 2:  like Twitter loving bloggers who became,

617
00:37:53,995 --> 00:37:56,645
Speaker 17:  They were in it massive things. Yeah, yeah. They, they were in it and they

618
00:37:56,645 --> 00:38:00,605
Speaker 17:  all started and blogging and they, you know, all of them owned an audience

619
00:38:00,705 --> 00:38:04,245
Speaker 17:  on blogs and then they moved to Twitter, which is an interesting shift.

620
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:07,685
Speaker 17:  And then they, from there they were able to do all the amazing things they've

621
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:11,605
Speaker 17:  done since then. And all of them I think agree that

622
00:38:11,785 --> 00:38:15,605
Speaker 17:  giving all of our best work to Twitter for free was

623
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:19,645
Speaker 17:  a mistake because all of the media institutions collapsed in the wake of

624
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,965
Speaker 17:  that decision. Let's give everything away for free and then we'll see what

625
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:25,845
Speaker 17:  happens. Maybe the platforms are thinking that we're important enough to

626
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:29,725
Speaker 17:  pay for the news. I don't know why anybody thought that this was true, because

627
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:33,525
Speaker 17:  the platforms are very happy to just move on to the next 20 something who

628
00:38:33,525 --> 00:38:37,445
Speaker 17:  will burn out and that is the cycle they're on. But I think what

629
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:41,125
Speaker 17:  the other thing that happened there that Ezra talked about really specifically

630
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:45,565
Speaker 17:  is that we started making the content for Twitter and

631
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:48,965
Speaker 17:  he said this thing to me that I keep thinking about, which is you can feel

632
00:38:48,965 --> 00:38:52,605
Speaker 17:  how it made you smaller, we increased the scale of our

633
00:38:52,845 --> 00:38:56,525
Speaker 17:  communication, but we decrease the quality of it by fitting everything into

634
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:59,605
Speaker 17:  the same box. Hmm. And so that's just, to me,

635
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:04,405
Speaker 17:  I fe I felt that, but by the end of the Twitter moment, I

636
00:39:04,405 --> 00:39:08,245
Speaker 17:  was communicating in tweets and we, that's like,

637
00:39:09,005 --> 00:39:12,685
Speaker 17:  I have more to to say than 240 characters, you know, 280

638
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:15,925
Speaker 17:  characters. So that, that to me is like the, the core thing that I think

639
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:19,645
Speaker 17:  people are reacting to now, that if you get away from Twitter for just

640
00:39:19,805 --> 00:39:22,525
Speaker 17:  a minute, David, you quit and you didn't look back. I know so many people

641
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:25,685
Speaker 17:  have quit over the last year and it's like, for a day or two

642
00:39:26,185 --> 00:39:30,045
Speaker 17:  you're like, I had something happened to me, I must complain. And then

643
00:39:30,225 --> 00:39:33,845
Speaker 17:  you stop doing that and your brain just like

644
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:37,365
Speaker 17:  bounces back so quickly and you're like, oh, I'm having

645
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:41,205
Speaker 17:  fuller richer thoughts. And that's pleasing to me

646
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:45,525
Speaker 17:  in that I know so many people who've had that exact experience

647
00:39:45,825 --> 00:39:49,685
Speaker 17:  to be like, oh, it's more rewarding to think longer thoughts

648
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:54,005
Speaker 17:  and not seek the dopamine hit of instant feedback all the time.

649
00:39:54,195 --> 00:39:57,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I've actually discovered recently that I, I now have the opposite problem,

650
00:39:57,725 --> 00:40:01,365
Speaker 2:  which is like, as somebody for whom it is like debatably, but potentially

651
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:04,965
Speaker 2:  professionally useful to like be present online and be a person who posts

652
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:08,685
Speaker 2:  a lot, the number of things that now don't get through my filter of I should

653
00:40:08,685 --> 00:40:12,285
Speaker 2:  post this on the internet is like way too high. And, and I need to like,

654
00:40:12,565 --> 00:40:15,605
Speaker 2:  I need to get back to saying dumb shit on the internet because that's like

655
00:40:15,795 --> 00:40:19,725
Speaker 2:  what we all do all day. And it's way I now have

656
00:40:19,725 --> 00:40:22,685
Speaker 2:  just like complaints that stay in my head and then they just go away. And

657
00:40:22,685 --> 00:40:25,325
Speaker 2:  like, that's not, that's not what the internet is for. Like I'm doing this

658
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:26,285
Speaker 2:  wrong. Yeah.

659
00:40:26,365 --> 00:40:30,125
Speaker 18:  I think, I think it's okay to, to sometimes sit on your, your complaints

660
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:33,485
Speaker 18:  and things, right? Like that's, that's why Twitter sucked a lot of the times.

661
00:40:33,645 --> 00:40:36,765
Speaker 18:  I like, I didn't use it as much as you guys did. I I came to it kind of

662
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:40,725
Speaker 18:  late, like I think I heard about it in 2007 from the PVP web comic.

663
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:43,605
Speaker 18:  And then was like, what? That's stupid. I'm not gonna use that. That's

664
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:46,405
Speaker 2:  Pretty early by the way. I think you're you're still good on that front.

665
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:46,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

666
00:40:46,685 --> 00:40:50,445
Speaker 18:  I'm still, but I didn't join until like 2009 and I was like, everybody's

667
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:53,885
Speaker 18:  joining and then I didn't, I didn't hit like, I didn't post really

668
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:57,805
Speaker 18:  until I started working I think at Gawker because that was a place that

669
00:40:57,805 --> 00:41:01,365
Speaker 18:  was very digital media and was very like everybody was online. Right. And,

670
00:41:01,385 --> 00:41:04,245
Speaker 18:  and So I just had a very, I think, I feel like I had a different relationship

671
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:07,365
Speaker 18:  with it than, than you guys to some extent because I, I did, the few times

672
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:10,685
Speaker 18:  I did complain, like Tucker Carlson was like, okay, cool, let me just put

673
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:13,485
Speaker 18:  that out for everybody else to see too. And I'm like, I don't, I don't need

674
00:41:13,485 --> 00:41:13,645
Speaker 18:  that.

675
00:41:13,945 --> 00:41:16,405
Speaker 2:  Do you think you had a healthier relationship with it? Like, do you look

676
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:19,445
Speaker 2:  back and think like, oh, I I spent an appropriate amount of time using and

677
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:20,125
Speaker 2:  thinking about Twitter?

678
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:20,965
Speaker 17:  Mm,

679
00:41:21,865 --> 00:41:25,485
Speaker 18:  For the first half, yes. Okay. For the second half, no. Like, as your

680
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:28,565
Speaker 18:  followers would go up, you, you just, like, you start doing it more 'cause

681
00:41:28,565 --> 00:41:30,805
Speaker 18:  you want more followers, you wanna see more, you want the engagement and

682
00:41:30,805 --> 00:41:33,885
Speaker 18:  like you get into that cycle and once you're in that cycle, you can't escape

683
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:37,765
Speaker 18:  it. And you do like, start to be do dumber and dumber things and

684
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:41,165
Speaker 18:  then Tucker Carlson is, is retweeting you or putting you up on the, on his

685
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,965
Speaker 18:  show. So yeah, like I, I definitely felt like ISI watched it all

686
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:48,285
Speaker 18:  happen, but I think the thing that really sticks out to me was to your point,

687
00:41:48,475 --> 00:41:52,085
Speaker 18:  NELI, how it changed relationships between creators and, and their

688
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:54,925
Speaker 18:  audiences. And it wasn't, it was like journalism was a big one, but the

689
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:58,445
Speaker 18:  one that I always go back to was, and like you guys are both gonna roll

690
00:41:58,445 --> 00:42:01,645
Speaker 18:  your eyes, was Glee. Do you get, you remember Glee the horrible TV show?

691
00:42:02,065 --> 00:42:04,805
Speaker 2:  Don Don't remember the horrible TV show Glee? I remember the wonderful TV

692
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:05,525
Speaker 2:  show Glee. Oh,

693
00:42:05,945 --> 00:42:09,205
Speaker 18:  Oh, we're in different places, David. We're in different places. But, but

694
00:42:09,205 --> 00:42:12,685
Speaker 18:  when Glee came out, it was a very online show. It was like that and Shonda

695
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:15,445
Speaker 18:  Rhimes doing stuff with Scandal. Those, those two shows were really all

696
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:19,165
Speaker 18:  about using Twitter and everything. But with Glee, the audience was a lot

697
00:42:19,165 --> 00:42:22,485
Speaker 18:  younger and that audience learned that they could like, because they had

698
00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:26,285
Speaker 18:  the direct relationship with the, the creators and the, the the

699
00:42:26,285 --> 00:42:30,085
Speaker 18:  actors and everything. They had that direct relationship and then they

700
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:33,325
Speaker 18:  started to demand things and they started to make demands. And then sometimes

701
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:36,445
Speaker 18:  the show would like be like, okay, you guys want these two characters to

702
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:39,725
Speaker 18:  make out, we're gonna do it. Yeah. And then it was like, oh no, that's actually

703
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:43,365
Speaker 18:  terrible. Like actually you shouldn't have that relationship between creators

704
00:42:44,025 --> 00:42:47,925
Speaker 18:  and, and the people and taking it in because like,

705
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:51,925
Speaker 18:  can you imagine like, it, it was just bad just led to bad tv. And then a

706
00:42:51,925 --> 00:42:55,245
Speaker 18:  lot of TV shows and a lot of movies and stuff started chasing that started

707
00:42:55,245 --> 00:42:57,925
Speaker 18:  chasing like, well, what will the fans think? And it was like, actually

708
00:42:57,925 --> 00:43:00,725
Speaker 18:  there's only four fans and they're very vocal and they have a bunch of sock

709
00:43:00,725 --> 00:43:02,445
Speaker 18:  puppet accounts. Maybe don't chase that.

710
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:06,165
Speaker 17:  It's just Zack Snyder being like, make it darker.

711
00:43:07,315 --> 00:43:11,245
Speaker 17:  Just can you grit this up? I'm looking for Glee, but there's a

712
00:43:11,245 --> 00:43:12,565
Speaker 17:  murder. Come on.

713
00:43:12,755 --> 00:43:13,725
Speaker 18:  That was every episode

714
00:43:13,915 --> 00:43:16,005
Speaker 17:  Glee on these streets, the Zach Snyder story,

715
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:17,805
Speaker 2:  To be fair, I would watch that. I was

716
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:19,925
Speaker 18:  Like, I would a hundred percent watch that. That's,

717
00:43:19,925 --> 00:43:22,845
Speaker 2:  That's like, that's an objectively better idea than any other Zack Snyder.

718
00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:25,765
Speaker 2:  Cut. So Zach, if you're listening and I know that you are,

719
00:43:26,065 --> 00:43:28,765
Speaker 17:  By the way, Alex is right by the way, Zach, if you're listening Glee on

720
00:43:28,765 --> 00:43:30,165
Speaker 17:  these streets, you can have it.

721
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:33,005
Speaker 18:  I want that.

722
00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:37,085
Speaker 17:  But to Alex's point, this actually did happen a lot. Like this joke

723
00:43:37,085 --> 00:43:41,045
Speaker 17:  about Zach Snyder there, he did run a coordinated harassment campaign

724
00:43:41,045 --> 00:43:44,885
Speaker 17:  against a bunch of Warner Media executives on Twitter. Yeah. Yep. It's a

725
00:43:44,885 --> 00:43:48,725
Speaker 17:  real thing. And no one could parse the difference between the

726
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:52,645
Speaker 17:  real fans who are spending money and just the volume

727
00:43:52,785 --> 00:43:56,645
Speaker 17:  of noise that existed in the world. And really, the thing I have

728
00:43:56,645 --> 00:44:00,605
Speaker 17:  come to think about Twitter the most is everyone is so desperate

729
00:44:00,665 --> 00:44:04,645
Speaker 17:  for feedback. They're so desperate to complete the

730
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:08,165
Speaker 17:  loop between cause and effect in their lives. And Twitter just

731
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:12,805
Speaker 17:  slotted neatly into that hole in everyone's brain. Oh,

732
00:44:12,805 --> 00:44:15,125
Speaker 17:  I can just get some feedback here. Oh, I can just see what's going on. Oh,

733
00:44:15,165 --> 00:44:18,965
Speaker 17:  I can just, I can put my finger on whatever the pulse of this group of people

734
00:44:18,965 --> 00:44:22,925
Speaker 17:  is. And that felt enough like feedback, even if it was

735
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:26,605
Speaker 17:  wrong, even if it was lies, even if it was coordinated bot activity from

736
00:44:26,605 --> 00:44:27,125
Speaker 17:  Glee fans

737
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:28,325
Speaker 18:  Led to bad things.

738
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:32,685
Speaker 17:  Is the world shaped more or less by coordinated bot activity by Glee

739
00:44:32,685 --> 00:44:36,325
Speaker 17:  fans? It's more than you think. Yeah. But it's, and it's because everyone

740
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:38,605
Speaker 17:  just wants the feedback and Twitter was there to provide it.

741
00:44:38,755 --> 00:44:42,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I feel like we also never figured out how

742
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:45,925
Speaker 2:  to put it in context, which I think is still true of a lot of social stuff

743
00:44:45,925 --> 00:44:49,845
Speaker 2:  right now. Right. Like, I remember so many perceived

744
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:53,885
Speaker 2:  scandals or bad things that happened were just like four people being mad

745
00:44:53,885 --> 00:44:57,485
Speaker 2:  on Twitter. And we got to the point, like there was a whole genre of story

746
00:44:57,485 --> 00:45:00,605
Speaker 2:  on the internet that was like, the internet is mad about X, Y, and Z and

747
00:45:00,605 --> 00:45:04,405
Speaker 2:  it just would embed four tweets as like evidence of the internet being mad

748
00:45:04,405 --> 00:45:08,245
Speaker 2:  about something. And that's so not reflective

749
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:12,125
Speaker 2:  of anything except like I could find four people who believe anything,

750
00:45:12,355 --> 00:45:13,885
Speaker 2:  literally anything at any time.

751
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:15,445
Speaker 17:  Especially an ex. Yeah,

752
00:45:15,445 --> 00:45:19,205
Speaker 2:  Exactly. And So I, I think part of what has been

753
00:45:19,865 --> 00:45:23,525
Speaker 2:  so strange is that like I, we have not solved that problem in any way. Right?

754
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:27,325
Speaker 2:  And I think so much of Twitter was that everything felt big

755
00:45:27,545 --> 00:45:31,365
Speaker 2:  and fast and vibrant and chaotic. And it was like, I think there were

756
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:35,245
Speaker 2:  people who used Twitter in a like group chatty kind of way where you

757
00:45:35,245 --> 00:45:38,525
Speaker 2:  just like find your handful of people and you have sort of a public messaging

758
00:45:38,525 --> 00:45:41,285
Speaker 2:  service to each other on there. And that's a totally valid use of Twitter

759
00:45:41,285 --> 00:45:45,125
Speaker 2:  that I think is not being replaced really anywhere. And I think

760
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:48,845
Speaker 2:  that's really interesting. But this thing that it was just like, it, it just

761
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:52,685
Speaker 2:  felt lively and whatever you cared about it felt like other people cared

762
00:45:52,685 --> 00:45:55,325
Speaker 2:  about it too. And you could tell any story you wanted with it. And we just

763
00:45:55,325 --> 00:45:58,605
Speaker 2:  like never figured out how to put any of that in context. Like, I think it

764
00:45:58,605 --> 00:46:01,845
Speaker 2:  was, I think it was Charlie Wartell who's now at the Atlantic at one point,

765
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:05,725
Speaker 2:  who said to me like, anytime I read the internet, on the internet, I

766
00:46:05,725 --> 00:46:09,125
Speaker 2:  read 12 people on Twitter. And it changes the context of how you think about

767
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:11,925
Speaker 2:  everything. And I still think about that all the time. That's

768
00:46:11,925 --> 00:46:14,205
Speaker 17:  How I think about TikTok too. It's like, people say people on TikTok and

769
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:15,885
Speaker 17:  it's like, not really, it's like four

770
00:46:15,885 --> 00:46:17,565
Speaker 2:  People. It's a, a video

771
00:46:17,745 --> 00:46:20,605
Speaker 17:  And you can't even find, at least on Twitter, you could go find the four

772
00:46:20,605 --> 00:46:24,565
Speaker 17:  people on, on TikTok. Yeah. It's, it's, it's totally segmented away.

773
00:46:25,145 --> 00:46:28,365
Speaker 17:  The thing that I, I I just want to bring some balance back to this.

774
00:46:29,155 --> 00:46:32,445
Speaker 17:  It's very easy now to look back on Twitter. It's this very negative force,

775
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:35,805
Speaker 17:  especially 'cause of what it has become and all of us have gotten away from

776
00:46:35,805 --> 00:46:39,645
Speaker 17:  it. But I, I think on the show I've compared Twitter to smoking like

777
00:46:39,765 --> 00:46:43,685
Speaker 17:  a million times. Yes. I can't smoke a cigarette anymore. Like

778
00:46:43,745 --> 00:46:47,605
Speaker 17:  I'm an old man and I haven't smoked in a long time. And every now and again

779
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:51,205
Speaker 17:  I see someone doing it and I take a drag and the next day I'm like, why

780
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:55,285
Speaker 17:  my, I'm still coughing. When I smoked, it ruled like

781
00:46:56,025 --> 00:46:59,965
Speaker 17:  it was the best. And I like organized my days

782
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:03,325
Speaker 17:  around this activity and then I quit and it was really hard to quit.

783
00:47:04,105 --> 00:47:07,725
Speaker 17:  But there's no part of me that looks back on that and is like, huh, you

784
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:10,845
Speaker 17:  know, like all of my whole life would've been better or different. It's

785
00:47:10,845 --> 00:47:14,245
Speaker 17:  like, that is the thing that happened. For better or worse, lots of people

786
00:47:14,315 --> 00:47:18,245
Speaker 17:  enjoyed smoking and now maybe we're gonna quit.

787
00:47:18,985 --> 00:47:22,085
Speaker 17:  but it made everyone's life exciting. I can't tell if I'm talking about

788
00:47:22,085 --> 00:47:25,645
Speaker 17:  cigarettes or Twitter right now. Twitter made everyone's life exciting.

789
00:47:25,715 --> 00:47:29,045
Speaker 17:  Like most people's lives are not inherently exciting.

790
00:47:29,845 --> 00:47:32,765
Speaker 17:  I'll, I'll give you this one example. I think about this all the time. I

791
00:47:32,765 --> 00:47:36,165
Speaker 17:  love watching like cooking tiktoks. There's all this movement in foods like

792
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:39,765
Speaker 17:  make everything from scratch or like do things the hard way or be natural.

793
00:47:40,345 --> 00:47:43,445
Speaker 17:  And you're like, if you weren't doing this on camera to an audience,

794
00:47:44,235 --> 00:47:47,765
Speaker 17:  this would be so boring if you had to wake up and make bread

795
00:47:48,295 --> 00:47:51,845
Speaker 17:  every day to feed your family. It's no wonder the industrial

796
00:47:52,325 --> 00:47:53,125
Speaker 17:  revolution happened,

797
00:47:54,975 --> 00:47:58,365
Speaker 17:  right? Like, this is actually not a rewarding task unless you have an audience

798
00:47:58,365 --> 00:48:02,045
Speaker 17:  or it's a special occasion if this, if your life is just like this mundane

799
00:48:02,535 --> 00:48:06,445
Speaker 17:  every single day, like of course you're gonna go look

800
00:48:06,445 --> 00:48:10,045
Speaker 17:  for some outside validation. And what phones generally have brought people

801
00:48:10,105 --> 00:48:14,005
Speaker 17:  is like an enormous way to go gain the outside

802
00:48:14,005 --> 00:48:17,565
Speaker 17:  validation. And so if Twitter did that for people, I think you can look

803
00:48:17,565 --> 00:48:20,885
Speaker 17:  at all the negatives that came along with it. But I think you can also look

804
00:48:20,885 --> 00:48:24,725
Speaker 17:  at the idea that a random kid in the middle

805
00:48:24,885 --> 00:48:28,845
Speaker 17:  of the country or around the world could go find not only

806
00:48:29,245 --> 00:48:33,085
Speaker 17:  external validation for whoever they wish to become, but also

807
00:48:33,165 --> 00:48:37,085
Speaker 17:  a sense of excitement that they too could like reach the audience. And that

808
00:48:37,085 --> 00:48:40,125
Speaker 17:  changed the nature of how we think about a lot of things, positive and negative.

809
00:48:40,195 --> 00:48:44,125
Speaker 17:  Totally. There's something to mind there. There's something to take out

810
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:48,045
Speaker 17:  of there that says, oh, we can actually make our lives like

811
00:48:48,085 --> 00:48:51,925
Speaker 17:  meaningfully different and better if we are just careful to not

812
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:55,165
Speaker 17:  bring the baggage of the noise along with us. I don't know that we're gonna

813
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:57,325
Speaker 17:  be careful. I think we're probably just gonna start smoking again.

814
00:48:58,075 --> 00:49:01,685
Speaker 2:  Well, and I do think all that stuff is totally inseparable, right? Which

815
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:05,725
Speaker 2:  is like why Twitter is fascinating because I think what it did was basically

816
00:49:05,725 --> 00:49:08,805
Speaker 2:  like lean into this sort of feeling of

817
00:49:09,295 --> 00:49:12,685
Speaker 2:  liveliness and like there's always something going on to like the

818
00:49:12,785 --> 00:49:16,565
Speaker 2:  100th degree and it made everything feel chaotic and

819
00:49:16,565 --> 00:49:19,405
Speaker 2:  problematic and everything moved too quickly. but it also had that like,

820
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:23,565
Speaker 2:  it it vibed in a way that nothing else like it has. And we're seeing this

821
00:49:23,565 --> 00:49:26,325
Speaker 2:  on threads now too, where they've like very deliberately turned that dial

822
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:29,965
Speaker 2:  down from a 10 to like a four and it feels way less

823
00:49:30,105 --> 00:49:33,125
Speaker 2:  fun. Yeah. It's like you can still find some of that. There's still community,

824
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:35,005
Speaker 2:  there's still interesting people, all that stuff. But this sense of like,

825
00:49:35,395 --> 00:49:39,245
Speaker 2:  something is happening, I have to go on Twitter or

826
00:49:39,245 --> 00:49:43,125
Speaker 2:  just this feeling like my pocket is buzzing because something is always

827
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:45,365
Speaker 2:  happening underneath that Twitter icon. Like, wait,

828
00:49:45,385 --> 00:49:48,205
Speaker 17:  Did you have notifications turned on Twitter until the very end? No.

829
00:49:48,205 --> 00:49:49,085
Speaker 2:  Dear God, no. Oh

830
00:49:49,085 --> 00:49:52,405
Speaker 17:  My God. I turned off notifications on Twitter like the second year. I was

831
00:49:52,405 --> 00:49:53,885
Speaker 17:  like, I no, thank you. All the

832
00:49:53,885 --> 00:49:57,845
Speaker 2:  People who had notifications on from Donald Trump when

833
00:49:57,845 --> 00:50:01,765
Speaker 2:  he was president during that presidency is like oof. I have, yeah. Anyone

834
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:05,685
Speaker 2:  who had Twitter notifications on after about 2014 was like a glutton for

835
00:50:05,685 --> 00:50:09,245
Speaker 2:  punishment. Yeah. But there was, I just mean like that that feeling of like,

836
00:50:09,745 --> 00:50:13,205
Speaker 2:  if I hit the Twitter icon on my phone, something is going to be happening.

837
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:17,405
Speaker 2:  Like is that a problematic drug In a very

838
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:21,165
Speaker 2:  real way, yes. but it was also the thing that made it so fun and

839
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:24,125
Speaker 2:  made it so lively and meant that everyone was there. So there were all these

840
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:27,965
Speaker 2:  opportunities and like you, we talk a lot about how badly run Twitter was

841
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:31,965
Speaker 2:  for all of its existence. And I think that there's an interesting

842
00:50:32,275 --> 00:50:35,485
Speaker 2:  sort of parallel universe in which it's much better run. And I actually don't

843
00:50:35,485 --> 00:50:38,125
Speaker 2:  think the outcome ends up being all that different. 'cause I just, it just

844
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:40,525
Speaker 2:  seems to me you can't have one side of that without the other. Yeah.

845
00:50:40,925 --> 00:50:44,885
Speaker 18:  I did actually, the early part of Twitter, I was really into

846
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:48,285
Speaker 18:  different communities. Like I was really into to film Twitter and, and,

847
00:50:48,285 --> 00:50:52,125
Speaker 18:  and all of those folks. And yet there was this ability to find a group and

848
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:56,005
Speaker 18:  find, find your people, so to speak. But that wasn't just inherent

849
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:59,045
Speaker 18:  to Twitter. That's, that's like, look, those communities form everywhere.

850
00:50:59,185 --> 00:51:02,045
Speaker 18:  And in fact the Twitter ones were probably the most disparate because it

851
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:06,125
Speaker 18:  did move so fast because it was like just, you'd get tons of noise

852
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:08,645
Speaker 18:  in there, you'd be like, oh, I really like this movie too. And then somebody

853
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:12,325
Speaker 18:  just blast in and say like, a horrible cuss, right?

854
00:51:12,635 --> 00:51:16,405
Speaker 18:  Like chanting, you're like, oh, get out. And, and I thought, I thought Sarah

855
00:51:16,465 --> 00:51:19,445
Speaker 18:  Jung's piece in the Twitter package was, was really good about, was talking

856
00:51:19,445 --> 00:51:23,085
Speaker 18:  about this and, and specifically that moderation because like, you know,

857
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:26,685
Speaker 18:  if you do that on a forum or live journal or Tumblr or, or Reddit, even

858
00:51:27,405 --> 00:51:29,405
Speaker 18:  somebody's gonna come in and be like, no, you can't do that. You're, you're

859
00:51:29,405 --> 00:51:32,405
Speaker 18:  out and kick you out. And and Twitter was always like, no, everybody's voice

860
00:51:32,405 --> 00:51:36,285
Speaker 18:  matters. And it's like, we learned that actually some people are

861
00:51:36,285 --> 00:51:40,085
Speaker 18:  just jerks and their voice. Like, we don't actually need to hear

862
00:51:40,325 --> 00:51:43,925
Speaker 18:  a bunch of cusses in a row after like an interesting conversation. Speak

863
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:44,445
Speaker 17:  For yourself.

864
00:51:45,515 --> 00:51:48,205
Speaker 2:  Well, and I think the, the other part of that Alex is like if you went on

865
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:51,765
Speaker 2:  letterbox and just like started cussing at people, like they would either

866
00:51:51,765 --> 00:51:54,565
Speaker 2:  kick you out of letterbox or just be like, we don't talk about that here.

867
00:51:54,565 --> 00:51:57,805
Speaker 2:  Right? And like Reddit would do that too. They have moderators, they do that

868
00:51:57,805 --> 00:52:01,085
Speaker 2:  stuff, but Twitter was just like, it was everything everywhere all the time.

869
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:03,325
Speaker 2:  So it's like, as long as you're not breaking the rules, you can talk about

870
00:52:03,485 --> 00:52:06,765
Speaker 2:  whatever you want. So like, you might follow me for tech stuff, but you're

871
00:52:06,765 --> 00:52:10,565
Speaker 2:  also gonna get me yelling at Delta when my flight is delayed. And then you're

872
00:52:10,565 --> 00:52:13,005
Speaker 2:  gonna get mad that your flight is delayed. And now we've gone down a whole

873
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:16,485
Speaker 2:  crazy rabbit hole way away from what we are like ostensibly here to talk

874
00:52:16,485 --> 00:52:20,165
Speaker 2:  about or why you followed me in the first place. And it just, it's like that

875
00:52:20,275 --> 00:52:24,085
Speaker 2:  pull is so intense that I feel like even like Film Twitter eventually

876
00:52:24,085 --> 00:52:27,205
Speaker 2:  became politics Twitter because it was just the thing it felt like everybody

877
00:52:27,225 --> 00:52:30,565
Speaker 2:  was talking about. And it's so you have to be like personally disciplined

878
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:33,205
Speaker 2:  to not do that. And I think if Twitter taught us anything, it's that we're

879
00:52:33,205 --> 00:52:34,885
Speaker 2:  not personally disciplined enough to not do that.

880
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,365
Speaker 18:  I'm trying, I tried for a very long time.

881
00:52:37,635 --> 00:52:41,405
Speaker 17:  There's something in there too that is very important that there was total

882
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:45,445
Speaker 17:  collapse in form on Twitter. So if you watch a TikTok and you don't like

883
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:49,245
Speaker 17:  the TikTok, it is perhaps likely that you'll make a duet or a stitch

884
00:52:49,245 --> 00:52:51,805
Speaker 17:  or something. It's much more likely that you're just gonna leave a text

885
00:52:51,805 --> 00:52:55,725
Speaker 17:  comment. And that means you have sort of down ranked yourself in the

886
00:52:55,725 --> 00:52:58,925
Speaker 17:  experience, right? The video is the, the primary element, and then your

887
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:01,765
Speaker 17:  comment is next to it. And maybe people will never see it. And even if you

888
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:05,405
Speaker 17:  make a duet video, you're, no one's gonna see it unless they find your video.

889
00:53:05,405 --> 00:53:09,125
Speaker 17:  Right? It's not in line on Twitter, it's all the same, right? Someone

890
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:12,085
Speaker 17:  tweets and someone replies and it's all the hierarchy. That information

891
00:53:12,085 --> 00:53:15,965
Speaker 17:  is the same, which meant drive by cuss

892
00:53:15,965 --> 00:53:19,885
Speaker 17:  words were elevated to the same level as the main thing

893
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:23,805
Speaker 17:  all the time and could quickly become the point, right? Like

894
00:53:23,845 --> 00:53:27,085
Speaker 17:  a bad tweet with 10,000 people below it saying ratio.

895
00:53:27,665 --> 00:53:31,485
Speaker 17:  The point of that was the word ratio. Yep. That's like fascinating.

896
00:53:31,485 --> 00:53:34,845
Speaker 17:  Like that's probably media studies, PhD. Like that's the only platform I

897
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:38,525
Speaker 17:  can think of that truly works like that. Even text posts on Facebook

898
00:53:38,525 --> 00:53:41,805
Speaker 17:  don't truly work like that. Twitter, the absolute collapse, I think just

899
00:53:41,905 --> 00:53:43,765
Speaker 17:  led to radically different dynamics.

900
00:53:43,795 --> 00:53:47,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. One a again, like the, the threads example there is really interesting

901
00:53:47,285 --> 00:53:50,045
Speaker 2:  is like Adam Messer even talked about that in the very early days of threads

902
00:53:50,045 --> 00:53:53,325
Speaker 2:  that like the thing that worked about Twitter was that sort of evening of

903
00:53:53,325 --> 00:53:55,965
Speaker 2:  all the content where it's not like a thing and then comments on the thing.

904
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:59,405
Speaker 2:  Everything is the same, but Threads has not actually panned out that way.

905
00:53:59,465 --> 00:54:02,845
Speaker 2:  And you can see it like, everybody kind of knows that if you reply to your

906
00:54:02,845 --> 00:54:06,725
Speaker 2:  own post on threads, your, your second post gets down ranked in

907
00:54:06,725 --> 00:54:09,765
Speaker 2:  the algorithm. And just because everything is algorithmic, like you, you

908
00:54:09,765 --> 00:54:13,685
Speaker 2:  just end up playing a different game. Whereas Twitter, even that it was

909
00:54:13,685 --> 00:54:17,605
Speaker 2:  algorithmic was so much less carefully curated for your interest

910
00:54:18,035 --> 00:54:21,405
Speaker 2:  that there was just this sense of like, you could just tweet the word ratio

911
00:54:21,465 --> 00:54:24,645
Speaker 2:  and there was a really good chance it was gonna show up in somebody's

912
00:54:24,885 --> 00:54:25,205
Speaker 17:  Timeline

913
00:54:26,105 --> 00:54:29,645
Speaker 2:  And like, yeah. And again, I feel like, and you talk about this in your piece

914
00:54:29,715 --> 00:54:33,485
Speaker 2:  Neli, that like the upside of that was it, it brought in new voices who never

915
00:54:33,485 --> 00:54:36,965
Speaker 2:  would've had a chance otherwise. It gave everybody what amounts to like one-to-one

916
00:54:36,965 --> 00:54:40,765
Speaker 2:  access to everybody else, which is terrifying and like

917
00:54:40,765 --> 00:54:44,525
Speaker 2:  exhilarating all at the same time. but it just, it did, it, it it sort of

918
00:54:44,575 --> 00:54:48,325
Speaker 2:  broke every barrier, like up and down and left and right of

919
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:51,885
Speaker 2:  how we talk to each other. And it, it feels like, I almost wish we had gotten

920
00:54:51,885 --> 00:54:55,285
Speaker 2:  like 50 more years of Twitter and we could see if we ever got good at it.

921
00:54:55,705 --> 00:54:59,285
Speaker 2:  And I'm not sure we would have, but it would've been an interesting thing

922
00:54:59,285 --> 00:55:03,045
Speaker 2:  to play out. And it's like, would Gen Z have figured it out

923
00:55:03,065 --> 00:55:06,245
Speaker 2:  and have like healthier relationships on Twitter? You don't think so?

924
00:55:06,785 --> 00:55:10,365
Speaker 17:  No. I think in one very important way, gen Z is much worse

925
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:14,205
Speaker 17:  at technology than anyone caress to admit. Like this is a generation that

926
00:55:14,205 --> 00:55:16,805
Speaker 17:  does not know about file systems. We've written that story. We just link

927
00:55:16,805 --> 00:55:20,165
Speaker 17:  that story in the show notes, right? Like they are worse at the

928
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:24,125
Speaker 17:  technical aspects of computing Yeah. In

929
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:27,965
Speaker 17:  some meaningfully measurable ways. And then they are much

930
00:55:27,965 --> 00:55:31,565
Speaker 17:  better at media literacy in other meaningful, measurable ways.

931
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:35,925
Speaker 17:  Like an entire generation of millennials were

932
00:55:35,995 --> 00:55:39,765
Speaker 17:  like experienced the I did bad tweets problem and like

933
00:55:39,915 --> 00:55:43,845
Speaker 17:  just loudly stuck their finger in the outlet for all the world to see over

934
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:47,685
Speaker 17:  and over again. Yeah. And all of, all of Gen Z just watched that

935
00:55:47,685 --> 00:55:48,005
Speaker 17:  happen.

936
00:55:49,005 --> 00:55:52,445
Speaker 19:  I would just like to interrupt quickly to let our Gen Z audience know that

937
00:55:52,935 --> 00:55:54,845
Speaker 19:  Eli's email address is neli at the

938
00:55:56,275 --> 00:55:59,365
Speaker 17:  This is no, I'm, this is a, this is a, you can email me and that's fine.

939
00:55:59,945 --> 00:56:03,925
Speaker 17:  I'm Gen X So I am outside of this. I, I, I cast no

940
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:07,085
Speaker 17:  aspersions on anyone. I think all of you should get off my lawn. Get back

941
00:56:07,085 --> 00:56:07,325
Speaker 17:  to work.

942
00:56:08,185 --> 00:56:10,005
Speaker 19:  We don't remember your generation. It's fine.

943
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:14,285
Speaker 17:  I raised myself Alex, but I think that the media literacy of,

944
00:56:14,385 --> 00:56:18,205
Speaker 17:  oh, I need to curate this persona for the world. My social media

945
00:56:18,525 --> 00:56:21,365
Speaker 17:  presence is something that I need to be in control of that that was the

946
00:56:21,495 --> 00:56:24,885
Speaker 17:  water, right? Like that, that's very native. That's not a new idea. And

947
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:28,205
Speaker 17:  So I, I, I don't know if Gen Z would've figured it out as much as they would've

948
00:56:28,205 --> 00:56:31,445
Speaker 17:  stopped using the tool in a way that made it as vibrant as this is. So

949
00:56:31,505 --> 00:56:34,285
Speaker 2:  To that point, actually, one of the things I'm curious what you guys think

950
00:56:34,305 --> 00:56:37,845
Speaker 2:  is if we are ever going to get something like this again, 'cause I think

951
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:42,405
Speaker 2:  on the one hand nobody would've predicted Twitter to turn out the

952
00:56:42,405 --> 00:56:46,125
Speaker 2:  way that it did. Right? It, it grew in weird, unusual, surprising ways.

953
00:56:46,545 --> 00:56:50,285
Speaker 2:  And I think it did a lot of things really well. And it was like culturally

954
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:53,805
Speaker 2:  vibrant in ways that very few tech products have ever been culturally

955
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:57,445
Speaker 2:  vibrant to the point where Tucker Carlson is reading Alex's tweets on

956
00:56:57,445 --> 00:57:00,885
Speaker 2:  television, which like, if you just think about it, is objectively insane.

957
00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:04,805
Speaker 2:  Like nothing about that makes any sense. Not just you Cranz, but like Yeah,

958
00:57:04,805 --> 00:57:06,285
Speaker 18:  Yeah. No, no, no, I agree. I was like,

959
00:57:06,305 --> 00:57:09,365
Speaker 2:  We talk about a decade of cable news is just like news anchors reading tweets

960
00:57:09,365 --> 00:57:11,485
Speaker 2:  to each other. Yes. And like it was, it really, really

961
00:57:11,585 --> 00:57:14,365
Speaker 17:  Was. It was just the worst podcast of all time

962
00:57:15,585 --> 00:57:19,445
Speaker 17:  for four years. CNN was just very expensive. Haircuts,

963
00:57:19,445 --> 00:57:20,045
Speaker 17:  reading tweets.

964
00:57:20,865 --> 00:57:24,765
Speaker 2:  But I also think like, to your point, NELI, the people coming up

965
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:28,925
Speaker 2:  are likely not going to go down the same road of like how

966
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:32,765
Speaker 2:  they exist online as we did in, you know,

967
00:57:32,765 --> 00:57:36,325
Speaker 2:  2007. So like Threads kind of wants to tweet Twitter, but it kind of doesn't

968
00:57:36,325 --> 00:57:39,245
Speaker 2:  wanna be Twitter X kind of wants to be Twitter but doesn't wanna be Twitter.

969
00:57:39,275 --> 00:57:43,245
Speaker 2:  Like, are we ever gonna get another thing that feels the

970
00:57:43,245 --> 00:57:45,685
Speaker 2:  way that Twitter did in 2015?

971
00:57:46,285 --> 00:57:50,085
Speaker 18:  I totally don't think so. Okay. And, and my, my rationale for this is

972
00:57:50,085 --> 00:57:53,885
Speaker 18:  that essentially the internet happened and, and everybody could suddenly

973
00:57:54,325 --> 00:57:57,565
Speaker 18:  communicate and then Twitter and, and Facebook and all these things were

974
00:57:57,565 --> 00:58:00,845
Speaker 18:  like, okay, what if everybody could communicate? What if Tucker Carlson,

975
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:04,125
Speaker 18:  Alex Cranz, David Pierce and Nicki Minaj were all in Pierce Morgan over

976
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:06,845
Speaker 18:  in the corner, we're all in the same coffee shop. Wouldn't that be great?

977
00:58:07,165 --> 00:58:10,765
Speaker 17:  I would go to that coffee shop so quickly just to see

978
00:58:11,075 --> 00:58:15,045
Speaker 17:  Nick mistake David for Pierce and then turn on in person

979
00:58:15,045 --> 00:58:16,485
Speaker 17:  Pierce mortgage. Like Yeah.

980
00:58:16,585 --> 00:58:19,685
Speaker 18:  And it sounds really compelling, right? It sounds like a cool ass coffee

981
00:58:19,715 --> 00:58:23,325
Speaker 18:  shop, but we're all talking at the same volume and also there's a hundred

982
00:58:23,605 --> 00:58:26,645
Speaker 18:  thousand other people all talking at the same volume in the same coffee

983
00:58:26,645 --> 00:58:29,925
Speaker 18:  shop. And we realized, wait a minute, that's actually too much. Actually

984
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:32,685
Speaker 18:  we do. And and we've seen that, right? We've seen like the decentralization

985
00:58:32,685 --> 00:58:36,245
Speaker 18:  of social media and it's happening a lot faster. And so those, those

986
00:58:36,245 --> 00:58:39,965
Speaker 18:  communities are cropping up in smaller places where they can close themselves

987
00:58:39,985 --> 00:58:42,965
Speaker 18:  off, where they can say, actually we don't want the person who just jumps

988
00:58:42,965 --> 00:58:46,725
Speaker 18:  in and says Cusses or Pi Morgan just accidentally like Nicki

989
00:58:46,885 --> 00:58:50,845
Speaker 18:  Minaj tweeting at David instead of Pierce Morgan. That's actually bad. We

990
00:58:50,845 --> 00:58:54,485
Speaker 18:  don't want that. And So I think like, it was a moment where we had the internet

991
00:58:54,485 --> 00:58:56,605
Speaker 18:  and we had this really great moment in the internet where we said, what

992
00:58:56,605 --> 00:58:59,765
Speaker 18:  if everybody could talk at the same time? And then we went, wait, no, that's

993
00:58:59,865 --> 00:59:03,485
Speaker 18:  bad. And I think collectively and just both like

994
00:59:03,485 --> 00:59:06,725
Speaker 18:  collectively us and in kind of what our package was about and what we've

995
00:59:06,725 --> 00:59:10,525
Speaker 18:  been talking about here, and also everybody out in the world who didn't

996
00:59:10,545 --> 00:59:14,045
Speaker 18:  use Twitter because it wasn't actually one of the most popular social media

997
00:59:14,115 --> 00:59:18,085
Speaker 18:  apps all realized together, no, this isn't actually something we want. Like

998
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:21,685
Speaker 18:  I think the hu the market spoke and the market was all of humanity

999
00:59:21,865 --> 00:59:23,725
Speaker 18:  coming together and saying, nevermind

1000
00:59:24,445 --> 00:59:28,325
Speaker 17:  Ezra raises this point in the piece that I wrote. He

1001
00:59:28,325 --> 00:59:31,805
Speaker 17:  said, I, he thinks that Twitter reached its peak at

1002
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:35,565
Speaker 17:  sort of 2020 with Covid and the Black Lives Matter

1003
00:59:35,685 --> 00:59:39,405
Speaker 17:  protests and that whole reckoning that occurred and that

1004
00:59:39,605 --> 00:59:43,405
Speaker 17:  sort of tearing down of institutions. And he says that was its peak. And

1005
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:47,245
Speaker 17:  after that, a bunch of large institutions, the government, big

1006
00:59:47,525 --> 00:59:51,405
Speaker 17:  companies, they all said, do we want Twitter to have this much influence

1007
00:59:51,405 --> 00:59:55,045
Speaker 17:  over us? And they sort of collectively decided no. And then that

1008
00:59:55,475 --> 00:59:59,085
Speaker 17:  barrels straight into January 6th, that barrell straight into

1009
00:59:59,275 --> 01:00:03,245
Speaker 17:  Elon buying Twitter. And you see that his point was, even if

1010
01:00:03,245 --> 01:00:06,365
Speaker 17:  Elon hadn't bought Twitter and turned it into X and sort of dismantled it,

1011
01:00:06,825 --> 01:00:10,805
Speaker 17:  the institutions were pushing back on it. They were saying this is

1012
01:00:10,825 --> 01:00:14,405
Speaker 17:  too much. And people like Ezra were saying, this is too much and I need

1013
01:00:14,405 --> 01:00:18,005
Speaker 17:  to get away from it. And so there would've been a natural pendulum swing

1014
01:00:18,535 --> 01:00:22,245
Speaker 17:  based on how intense 2020 was, but then Elon

1015
01:00:22,305 --> 01:00:23,405
Speaker 17:  showed up and he

1016
01:00:23,405 --> 01:00:26,845
Speaker 18:  Just accelerated. Yeah. He put a little rocket on the pendulum.

1017
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:27,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Right.

1018
01:00:28,075 --> 01:00:30,205
Speaker 17:  He's like, here's a falcon that doesn't work. Kaboom.

1019
01:00:31,035 --> 01:00:31,325
Speaker 18:  Yeah.

1020
01:00:31,325 --> 01:00:34,565
Speaker 2:  No, I I think that's right. I think it's like if, if we've learned anything

1021
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:38,445
Speaker 2:  from the last couple of years, it's that everything changes and we

1022
01:00:38,445 --> 01:00:42,365
Speaker 2:  are very in so, so, so many ways at the end of like a very

1023
01:00:42,685 --> 01:00:46,645
Speaker 2:  specific era of technology. And I think it's definitely

1024
01:00:46,645 --> 01:00:50,005
Speaker 2:  true that the pandemic sped a lot of that up. It's definitely true that Elon

1025
01:00:50,005 --> 01:00:53,245
Speaker 2:  Musk sp a lot of that up, but I think this was all kind of coming

1026
01:00:53,665 --> 01:00:57,285
Speaker 2:  anyway. And I do think, I think you're right, Cranz, that like at some point

1027
01:00:57,345 --> 01:01:00,045
Speaker 2:  in the last five years everybody kind of looked around and was like, this

1028
01:01:00,045 --> 01:01:03,485
Speaker 2:  is all a mess. And like this thing where we just all

1029
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,965
Speaker 2:  hang out together in one place is bad. Like I know

1030
01:01:08,505 --> 01:01:12,445
Speaker 2:  my family's political opinions in a way that I'm not in interested in knowing

1031
01:01:12,825 --> 01:01:16,405
Speaker 2:  and this is not helpful or good or making me feel better

1032
01:01:16,985 --> 01:01:20,845
Speaker 2:  and it was gonna happen eventually. But that said, I will look

1033
01:01:20,845 --> 01:01:24,085
Speaker 2:  back on this whole era as like pure chaos,

1034
01:01:24,785 --> 01:01:27,125
Speaker 2:  but there were good times. I'm friends with Nicki Minaj now.

1035
01:01:28,965 --> 01:01:32,605
Speaker 18:  I mean, I think it was a really important era and I think, I think

1036
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:36,925
Speaker 18:  we still haven't fully grasped just how big an impact it

1037
01:01:36,925 --> 01:01:40,765
Speaker 18:  had on us culturally and like as a society. Like I, I do

1038
01:01:40,765 --> 01:01:44,685
Speaker 18:  think that it was a big deal and, and it's gonna, we're gonna keep thinking

1039
01:01:44,685 --> 01:01:47,685
Speaker 18:  about it later on and we're gonna keep learning those lessons and thinking

1040
01:01:47,685 --> 01:01:48,805
Speaker 18:  about the lessons we learned from it.

1041
01:01:48,915 --> 01:01:52,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I do think we're still in the like Nicorette gum phase

1042
01:01:52,745 --> 01:01:55,565
Speaker 2:  yo Yeah. Of quitting smoking here. Like we're, we're definitely not out of

1043
01:01:55,965 --> 01:01:58,205
Speaker 2:  whatever brain space we've been in for a long time.

1044
01:01:58,275 --> 01:01:59,845
Speaker 18:  Yeah. Threads is just like a vape.

1045
01:02:01,515 --> 01:02:05,405
Speaker 17:  Yeah. I mean, is is Threads gonna be Nicorette or is

1046
01:02:05,405 --> 01:02:09,085
Speaker 17:  it gonna be a Juul or it's gonna be those weird off-brand

1047
01:02:09,445 --> 01:02:13,405
Speaker 17:  nicotine mints you can buy at the CVS? I've gone through it. I'm

1048
01:02:13,405 --> 01:02:17,085
Speaker 17:  just saying ideally we have none of them. We are not reliant on

1049
01:02:17,725 --> 01:02:21,445
Speaker 17:  a even weaker, diluted, centralized social media experience.

1050
01:02:21,595 --> 01:02:25,445
Speaker 17:  What we are gonna do is we're gonna build some distributed

1051
01:02:26,565 --> 01:02:30,445
Speaker 17:  platforms that let people own their audiences. And don't put all of

1052
01:02:30,465 --> 01:02:34,325
Speaker 17:  our, like the story of Twitter. I I was talking to a former Virgin

1053
01:02:34,525 --> 01:02:38,005
Speaker 17:  reporter now platform managing editors, Zoe Scheffer about this. And we

1054
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:41,925
Speaker 17:  sort of landed on the idea that Twitter is defined, the story of Twitter

1055
01:02:41,945 --> 01:02:45,645
Speaker 17:  is defined by two power users, Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

1056
01:02:45,985 --> 01:02:49,365
Speaker 17:  And like, that, that's, that's a, it's, that's a fun thing to think through.

1057
01:02:49,545 --> 01:02:52,245
Speaker 17:  And Zoe is on decoder and you can listen to that episode and we, we, we

1058
01:02:52,245 --> 01:02:55,005
Speaker 17:  thought it through together and that was good. But you take a step back,

1059
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:58,925
Speaker 17:  you're like, should that be how the world works? Like, should that be

1060
01:02:58,925 --> 01:03:02,765
Speaker 17:  how media works? Like two people who get really good at getting likes

1061
01:03:02,765 --> 01:03:06,445
Speaker 17:  on a platform suddenly like warp the world around.

1062
01:03:06,555 --> 01:03:09,525
Speaker 17:  Like that shouldn't be how that works. You should be able to find your own

1063
01:03:09,525 --> 01:03:13,365
Speaker 17:  little network. So I'm, I'm hopeful, I'm hopeful that Threads is successful

1064
01:03:13,365 --> 01:03:16,925
Speaker 17:  because I, they're gonna federate and you know, everyone knows how I feel

1065
01:03:16,925 --> 01:03:20,725
Speaker 17:  about that, but I'm also, I'm much more hopeful that people seek

1066
01:03:20,745 --> 01:03:24,645
Speaker 17:  out smaller pockets of the internet and that is actually what we

1067
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:29,005
Speaker 17:  aim for as opposed to just mindlessly centralizing once again.

1068
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:33,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think that's right. I I certainly hope that's true. I have a cynical

1069
01:03:33,445 --> 01:03:37,125
Speaker 2:  piece of my brain that wonders if we've now spent so long teaching people

1070
01:03:37,145 --> 01:03:41,125
Speaker 2:  how good it feels to chase giant audiences that telling them

1071
01:03:41,145 --> 01:03:44,045
Speaker 2:  to chase smaller audiences is gonna be hard to do.

1072
01:03:44,525 --> 01:03:48,045
Speaker 18:  I think it's okay. And, and I'm gonna point back to fandom because my, my

1073
01:03:48,045 --> 01:03:51,405
Speaker 18:  big theory of the universe is fandom is where all online like

1074
01:03:51,925 --> 01:03:55,325
Speaker 18:  behavior incubates. And so in fandom,

1075
01:03:55,555 --> 01:03:58,725
Speaker 18:  they've all gotten really upset. They're all actually, they're like, the

1076
01:03:58,725 --> 01:04:02,285
Speaker 18:  big discourse right now is that everybody's doing it for the likes on a

1077
01:04:02,365 --> 01:04:06,125
Speaker 18:  O three and Wattpad. And that's just inherently hysterical to, to do that

1078
01:04:06,145 --> 01:04:09,565
Speaker 18:  anyway. But, but you're seeing younger people, it's particularly younger

1079
01:04:09,565 --> 01:04:13,125
Speaker 18:  people like younger Gen Z and Gen A being like, we don't like that. And

1080
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:16,405
Speaker 18:  then like all the old millennials and, and Gen Xers being like, we also

1081
01:04:16,405 --> 01:04:20,165
Speaker 18:  don't like that. And so you're you're seeing people reject it in a

1082
01:04:20,345 --> 01:04:23,925
Speaker 18:  way that feels like heartening, not totally. It's still happening.

1083
01:04:23,925 --> 01:04:26,005
Speaker 17:  Gen X, gen Z alignment. It's right there. Yeah.

1084
01:04:26,595 --> 01:04:30,485
Speaker 18:  Just, but like, like young millennials and older Gen

1085
01:04:30,565 --> 01:04:34,005
Speaker 18:  Z are still like, I just do it. Like I have AI right by

1086
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:38,565
Speaker 18:  One Direction fanfic and it's like, think about what you've just said

1087
01:04:39,385 --> 01:04:41,805
Speaker 18:  and do you really want that to be your legacy online?

1088
01:04:42,225 --> 01:04:43,965
Speaker 17:  Alex's email is Alex Cranz.

1089
01:04:46,265 --> 01:04:48,085
Speaker 18:  If you use an AI to write your f your Bad

1090
01:04:48,235 --> 01:04:51,685
Speaker 2:  Send Alex links to all of your favorite AI generated Fanfic please.

1091
01:04:52,165 --> 01:04:53,165
Speaker 18:  I do actually wanna read that

1092
01:04:53,945 --> 01:04:57,765
Speaker 2:  All, right? We need to go. I will Miss Twitter. Yeah, I,

1093
01:04:57,795 --> 01:05:01,605
Speaker 2:  I'll just say it. It was good. We had a good run. I miss when I could just

1094
01:05:01,825 --> 01:05:05,285
Speaker 2:  dmm random strangers who happened to follow me on the internet accidentally.

1095
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:06,445
Speaker 2:  Those were good days.

1096
01:05:07,025 --> 01:05:10,285
Speaker 17:  My entire personality wa was like Miller Light and Marro Lights.

1097
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:13,525
Speaker 17:  Yeah, it was good. I had a good time in my twenties

1098
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:16,445
Speaker 2:  And now you have to figure out a new thing. Yeah, it's time.

1099
01:05:17,995 --> 01:05:21,485
Speaker 2:  It's time for all of us to figure out a new thing. That's our 2024 goal at

1100
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:24,405
Speaker 2:  the end of 2024. We're gonna come back, we're gonna do this and we're gonna

1101
01:05:24,405 --> 01:05:27,005
Speaker 2:  say what's our new thing? It's gonna be great. All, right? Thank you both.

1102
01:05:27,235 --> 01:05:27,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

1103
01:05:27,545 --> 01:05:29,405
Speaker 20:  No, that was good. Twitter. Yeah, that's good. I loved it.

1104
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:34,805
Speaker 2:  All right. We gotta take one more break and then we're gonna get to the Birch

1105

1111
01:07:20,145 --> 01:07:23,275
Speaker 2:  Very excited. Thank you to everybody who has reached out today. We have a

1112
01:07:23,395 --> 01:07:27,075
Speaker 2:  question about organizing photos, which is a thing I care very deeply about.

1113
01:07:27,535 --> 01:07:28,035
Speaker 2:  Here's that.

1114
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:32,435
Speaker 21:  Hey, Virg was just calling through my

1115
01:07:33,055 --> 01:07:36,555
Speaker 21:  iPhone photo library. My most recent number

1116
01:07:36,895 --> 01:07:38,595
Speaker 21:  in my iPhone photo library is

1117
01:07:38,595 --> 01:07:42,555
Speaker 21:  74,224 photos. We can all be

1118
01:07:42,745 --> 01:07:45,875
Speaker 21:  real about the fact that these are not all photos that I need to have in

1119
01:07:46,035 --> 01:07:49,075
Speaker 21:  my life and I am wondering if there's any app,

1120
01:07:49,785 --> 01:07:53,635
Speaker 21:  website, any kind of tool that any of you have used that

1121
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:57,435
Speaker 21:  has been helpful in terms of curating your photo

1122
01:07:57,435 --> 01:08:01,275
Speaker 21:  library in mass, especially one that that's that big. Hope you can help

1123
01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:01,955
Speaker 21:  me out. Thanks. Bye.

1124
01:08:02,665 --> 01:08:06,035
Speaker 2:  Okay, I have a bunch of thoughts on this subject. The first thing I would

1125
01:08:06,035 --> 01:08:08,715
Speaker 2:  say is take all of those photos, all

1126
01:08:08,715 --> 01:08:12,515
Speaker 2:  74,000, however many it was, and put them all

1127
01:08:12,515 --> 01:08:16,245
Speaker 2:  somewhere before you start organizing. Before you start putting things in

1128
01:08:16,245 --> 01:08:20,125
Speaker 2:  the places that they deserve to go, just take the whole batch and

1129
01:08:20,145 --> 01:08:23,565
Speaker 2:  put them don Don't know in Amazon Photos, which you might have if you have

1130
01:08:23,565 --> 01:08:27,245
Speaker 2:  a Prime subscription or in Google Photos or put them on a hard drive

1131
01:08:27,245 --> 01:08:30,685
Speaker 2:  somewhere or back them up to another computer, like put all of your photos

1132
01:08:31,075 --> 01:08:34,485
Speaker 2:  somewhere. Because at least in my experience, there's always been a time

1133
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:37,405
Speaker 2:  where I delete something 'cause I didn't think I'd want it and then I want

1134
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:41,325
Speaker 2:  it or I'm going through stuff later and I accidentally should have kept

1135
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:45,085
Speaker 2:  something that I didn't just take the whole number and shove 'em somewhere.

1136
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:49,125
Speaker 2:  Then I have three organization tips. The first thing

1137
01:08:49,345 --> 01:08:53,245
Speaker 2:  is on your phone, open up photos and then go to albums

1138
01:08:53,545 --> 01:08:57,405
Speaker 2:  and then scroll down and you get to the list of media types.

1139
01:08:57,745 --> 01:09:01,725
Speaker 2:  And that's actually an incredibly good way to organize some of your photos,

1140
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:05,165
Speaker 2:  really just to delete a lot of them. Like for me, I have hundreds and hundreds

1141
01:09:05,165 --> 01:09:09,045
Speaker 2:  and hundreds and hundreds of screenshots saved here and I don't need any

1142
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:12,605
Speaker 2:  of them. So if you just open up screenshots, you can select all really easily,

1143
01:09:12,985 --> 01:09:16,285
Speaker 2:  delete them, that's a huge portion of them gone. You can do the same with

1144
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:20,085
Speaker 2:  videos, with selfies, with live photos, with panoramas.

1145
01:09:20,435 --> 01:09:23,925
Speaker 2:  It's not a perfect way to weed stuff out, but it's actually a pretty good

1146
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:26,885
Speaker 2:  one in my experience. So that's where I would start. The second thing is

1147
01:09:27,225 --> 01:09:30,765
Speaker 2:  to go to duplicates, which is down at the very bottom of that album's page

1148
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:34,925
Speaker 2:  and merge all the duplicates you can. This is less of an issue if you do

1149
01:09:34,925 --> 01:09:38,845
Speaker 2:  most of your photography actually on your iPhone, but if you do a lot of

1150
01:09:38,845 --> 01:09:42,485
Speaker 2:  importing from other cameras or moving stuff around between devices, odds

1151
01:09:42,485 --> 01:09:45,765
Speaker 2:  are you're going to get duplicate photos. And the iPhone does a pretty good

1152
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:49,685
Speaker 2:  job of managing that and knowing when two photos are

1153
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:53,325
Speaker 2:  identical. So I've just been able to go through select all, merge all,

1154
01:09:53,545 --> 01:09:57,525
Speaker 2:  and boom, there go hundreds of my different photos all into

1155
01:09:57,705 --> 01:10:00,405
Speaker 2:  the correct number of photos. So that's what I would do. And then there are

1156
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:04,245
Speaker 2:  two apps that I have to recommend. One is called Slide Box and one is

1157
01:10:04,245 --> 01:10:08,165
Speaker 2:  called Swipe Wipe. Personally I have mostly used Swipe Wipe,

1158
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:12,005
Speaker 2:  but both Slide Box and Swipe Wipe. These are ridiculous things to say out

1159
01:10:12,005 --> 01:10:15,805
Speaker 2:  loud are on iPhone and Android and they're basically like Tinder

1160
01:10:15,805 --> 01:10:19,405
Speaker 2:  for your photos. You just open the apps up, swipe through, and

1161
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:23,365
Speaker 2:  you quickly just choose basically keeper, toss Keeper, toss Keeper, toss.

1162
01:10:23,775 --> 01:10:27,445
Speaker 2:  Slide Box I think has more organization. You can put them into

1163
01:10:27,905 --> 01:10:31,405
Speaker 2:  albums and stuff like that, but for me it's just like right and left

1164
01:10:31,755 --> 01:10:35,645
Speaker 2:  Keep Don't Keep is a surprisingly quick way to get through a

1165
01:10:35,685 --> 01:10:38,645
Speaker 2:  ton of photos. They both cost some money, but if I'm remembering correctly,

1166
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:42,565
Speaker 2:  slide box I think is $10 once for the premium

1167
01:10:42,565 --> 01:10:46,485
Speaker 2:  account, then you get it forever and Swipe Wipe I think is more

1168
01:10:46,485 --> 01:10:49,965
Speaker 2:  expensive. It's like six bucks a week, but you get three days for free.

1169
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:54,205
Speaker 2:  So if you just want to do it once and just like spend a couple of hours going

1170
01:10:54,205 --> 01:10:57,285
Speaker 2:  through all of your photos, you can do it without having to pay any money.

1171
01:10:57,425 --> 01:11:00,245
Speaker 2:  And that's actually what I would do. My favorite way to do this is to go

1172
01:11:00,245 --> 01:11:03,525
Speaker 2:  through all my photos. Basically on the largest screen you have like the

1173
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:07,565
Speaker 2:  iPad's a good one, phone works fine, Mac Works fine, doesn't

1174
01:11:07,565 --> 01:11:10,725
Speaker 2:  have the apps, but is like a bigger screen you can look at it on. I usually

1175
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:14,405
Speaker 2:  do this on my iPad personally. Download the apps, start looking at your photos.

1176
01:11:14,765 --> 01:11:18,605
Speaker 2:  I tend to like put on a podcast or watch a movie and just swipe

1177
01:11:18,605 --> 01:11:22,485
Speaker 2:  through photos, just swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe. And you'll be amazed

1178
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:26,245
Speaker 2:  how quickly you get through stuff. 74,000 photos is a lot of photos, but

1179
01:11:26,245 --> 01:11:29,565
Speaker 2:  also you don't have to go through every single one of them in order to have

1180
01:11:29,725 --> 01:11:33,685
Speaker 2:  a much better handle on your camera roll. So that's what I would do.

1181
01:11:34,005 --> 01:11:37,285
Speaker 2:  I am sure there are other apps. If you have one that you really like for

1182
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:40,925
Speaker 2:  organizing and cleaning up your camera roll, let me know. Again, Vergecast

1183
01:11:40,925 --> 01:11:44,805
Speaker 2:  to The Verge dot com. 8, 6, 6. Verge one, one is the Hotline

1184
01:11:44,805 --> 01:11:48,645
Speaker 2:  number, but again, back 'em All Up somewhere. And then Slide Box and Swipe

1185
01:11:48,645 --> 01:11:52,005
Speaker 2:  Wipe are the two that I've found that I really like. They're very helpful.

1186
01:11:52,565 --> 01:11:56,365
Speaker 2:  I hope that helps. And if you get through, I want to know how many

1187
01:11:56,365 --> 01:11:59,645
Speaker 2:  of those 74,000 actually stick around. So keep me posted.
