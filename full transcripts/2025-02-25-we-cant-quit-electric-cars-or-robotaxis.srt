Description: Robotaxis: in. EVs: Out? The Verge's Andy Hawkins joins the show to talk about the goings-on in the transportation industry, including the reasons car makers are slowing down on EV production (but not giving up entirely) and why suddenly everyone's back in on robotaxis. Then, The Social Web Foundation's Evan Prodromou tells us what's new with the fediverse. We talk about Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon, and the increasingly ambitious plans for the ActivityPub protocol. Finally, we talk through some feedback on last week's episode about the pricing of the iPhone 16E, and how the way you buy your phone changes the way you feel about its price.

2
00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:07,075
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Intra Protocol

3
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:10,755
Speaker 2:  Competition. I'm your friend, David Pierce, and I am once again

4
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:14,875
Speaker 2:  attempting to learn how to do a Rubik's cube. So during the pandemic, the

5
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:18,155
Speaker 2:  two sort of weirdest days I had were the day that I woke up and decided to

6
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:21,435
Speaker 2:  learn how to juggle, which I successfully did. I'm not gonna do it for you

7
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:24,515
Speaker 2:  now, but I'm like a reasonably good juggler now. And then there was the day

8
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:27,435
Speaker 2:  that I woke up and decided I was going to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube

9
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:31,555
Speaker 2:  and just utterly failed. And so now I have this Rubik cube that just

10
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:34,275
Speaker 2:  sits here on my desk and I sort of fidget with it during meetings. I like

11
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:38,155
Speaker 2:  it for that, but mostly it just taunts me because it is unsolved and I don't

12
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:42,115
Speaker 2:  know how to solve it. So I have a bunch of YouTube videos. I have a a webpage

13
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:45,715
Speaker 2:  that is just step-by-step instructions. I'm realizing this is less like a

14
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:49,755
Speaker 2:  creative endeavor and more just sort of memorizing an algorithm. But I kinda

15
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:52,075
Speaker 2:  like that. I'm ready for that. I'm gonna try it. It's gonna be great. I'll

16
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:55,755
Speaker 2:  update you next week, see if I actually pull this off. That is not what we're

17
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:59,075
Speaker 2:  here to do on the show today. We're gonna do two things today. First, we're

18
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:02,755
Speaker 2:  gonna talk to Andy Hawkins about what's going on in the car world, because

19
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:05,955
Speaker 2:  right now it seems like EVs are kind of going away and

20
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:09,475
Speaker 2:  robotaxis are suddenly back. So we're gonna talk about both those things.

21
00:01:09,865 --> 00:01:13,075
Speaker 2:  Then we're gonna talk to Evan Promo, who is one of the people overseeing

22
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:16,595
Speaker 2:  the Activity Pub protocol. We're gonna talk about Blue Sky and

23
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:20,355
Speaker 2:  Threads and Mastodon and the whole world of social

24
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:24,235
Speaker 2:  networking right now and where we're headed this year. We also have a really

25
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:27,955
Speaker 2:  fun hotline question about the iPhone 16 E with some of the thoughts that

26
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:31,395
Speaker 2:  we've heard from all of you since we talked about it on Friday. Lots to do,

27
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:35,515
Speaker 2:  lots to talk about, but the first step in my Rubik's cube as I understand

28
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:39,395
Speaker 2:  it, is to get one side solved. So I'm gonna go do that and

29
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:42,275
Speaker 2:  we'll be right back. This is The Vergecast. See you in a sec.

30
00:03:48,305 --> 00:03:52,115
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. I managed to get six out of nine blue

31
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:56,075
Speaker 2:  things in the right place during the break. I don't think that's very good,

32
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,995
Speaker 2:  but it feels like a start. I'm, I'm, I will solve this thing if it

33
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:03,835
Speaker 2:  kills me. Anyway, let's just get into it. First up, we're gonna talk to Andy

34
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:07,475
Speaker 2:  Hawkins because following the transportation news the last few weeks,

35
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:11,715
Speaker 2:  there's this strange momentum shift happening on the one

36
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:15,475
Speaker 2:  hand, electric vehicles, which I think have been not on the

37
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:19,155
Speaker 2:  decline, but kind of outta fashion for the last little while, feel like

38
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:22,275
Speaker 2:  they're falling further and further out of fashion really quickly. And that

39
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:26,075
Speaker 2:  seems odd to me. Then on the flip side, you have companies like Uber and

40
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:29,875
Speaker 2:  Lyft making a big deal out of Robotaxis again, like it's a decade ago, and

41
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,715
Speaker 2:  we're all pretending that robotaxis are gonna be a thing. The the momentum

42
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:37,435
Speaker 2:  shift here is just very odd to me, and Andy's been covering it a lot. So

43
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:41,045
Speaker 2:  I think it's just time to get into it. Let's just call up Andy, see how we're

44
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:44,815
Speaker 2:  doing. Andy Hawkins, welcome back to the show. Hi. Thanks for having me.

45
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:48,855
Speaker 2:  It's been a minute. I feel like there is both, there's like so much car

46
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,895
Speaker 2:  news that there's never a good moment to be like, let's, let's just take

47
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:55,455
Speaker 2:  a break and talk about car news. It just like, it just keeps happening.

48
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:59,695
Speaker 2:  It does. It never stops. So, okay, so I brought you here I think for

49
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:03,255
Speaker 2:  like two and a half reasons and the half

50
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:07,295
Speaker 2:  we're gonna do as quickly and painlessly as possible, and that is, we have

51
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:10,775
Speaker 2:  to talk about Elon Musk and Teslas. Oh god. Alright. But we're gonna do that

52
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:14,775
Speaker 2:  so fast and at the end. Okay. I promised at the top of this show that the

53
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:18,655
Speaker 2:  Tuesday Vergecast is going to be a safe place from now on, and

54
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:22,335
Speaker 2:  I intend to live up to that as best We can. The two things I really wanna

55
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:25,975
Speaker 2:  talk about are sort of this moment in the EV revolution

56
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:29,935
Speaker 2:  because we're, it's sort of an odd moment in the

57
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:33,375
Speaker 2:  EV landscape and I just wanna feel that out a little bit. And then I wanna

58
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,215
Speaker 2:  talk about robotaxis, which are both like closer than ever and still

59
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:39,575
Speaker 2:  seem like a total pipe dream, and I just need you to make sense of those

60
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:42,055
Speaker 2:  things to me. Does that all sound good? I, I'm, I'm happy to do that for

61
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:46,015
Speaker 2:  you. Okay, good. Let's start with the EV stuff, and I think this is

62
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:49,575
Speaker 2:  particularly on my mind because Nicola, this ev

63
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:53,655
Speaker 2:  truck maker that I think has been somewhere between mostly

64
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:57,765
Speaker 2:  a fraud and entirely a fraud for a pretty long time now, finally declared

65
00:05:57,765 --> 00:06:01,645
Speaker 2:  bankruptcy. And it just feels like we're at this moment, and we've talked

66
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:05,565
Speaker 2:  about this a few times on the show where EVs were going to be the thing and

67
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,285
Speaker 2:  everybody decided that EVs were going to be the thing, and this,

68
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:13,325
Speaker 2:  this revolution in electric vehicles just keeps shooting itself in the foot

69
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:17,405
Speaker 2:  every imaginable way. So where, where are

70
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:21,125
Speaker 2:  we right now in, in early 2025 in kind of the, the

71
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:22,125
Speaker 2:  EV universe?

72
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:26,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so I, I think you could say that even the, the, the biggest

73
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,805
Speaker 6:  supporters and boosters of electric vehicles will, will admit that

74
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:34,005
Speaker 6:  sales have kind of flatlined, and this is, you

75
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:37,805
Speaker 6:  know, both in the US and in Europe, but also in

76
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:41,045
Speaker 6:  in China as well. And China is sort of like the, the, the kind of the big

77
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:43,525
Speaker 6:  X factor hanging over all of this. And We can get to them in a minute, but,

78
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:47,765
Speaker 6:  but yeah, it's sort of a, it's a weird place because we're coming

79
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:51,605
Speaker 6:  off of four years of an extremely ev friendly administration

80
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,445
Speaker 6:  in the White House to whatever the opposite of that is now

81
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:59,725
Speaker 6:  the most hostile administration that we've ever seen towards

82
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:03,565
Speaker 6:  electric vehicles to the point where a lot of these policies decisions seem

83
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:07,525
Speaker 6:  to be being made just out of spite is how I would describe

84
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:11,325
Speaker 6:  it. And so on, on top of all of that, you also have a lot of

85
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:14,925
Speaker 6:  these kind of like mid to low tier startups

86
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:19,445
Speaker 6:  that came into prominence over the last decade or so

87
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:24,205
Speaker 6:  on the promise of electrifying, you know, certain segments of the car

88
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:27,805
Speaker 6:  markets. So for Nicholas Case, it was gonna be heavy duty trucks and they

89
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:31,405
Speaker 6:  were going to be battery powered, they were going to be some hydrogen powered

90
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:35,645
Speaker 6:  trucks in the mix, and this was gonna be sort of a, a major push to

91
00:07:36,345 --> 00:07:39,645
Speaker 6:  get, get all the, the, the pollution out of the heavy trucking industry.

92
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:44,045
Speaker 6:  But this is a company that had a lot of problems even before

93
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:47,765
Speaker 6:  Trump came into office. I mean, like, like you mentioned, there was allegations

94
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:51,525
Speaker 6:  of fraud. There was a, a real kind of like dramatic

95
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:55,685
Speaker 6:  report from this short selling group called Hindenberg that accused

96
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:59,885
Speaker 6:  Nicola of staging a lot of its sort of hype videos showing its trucks

97
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:04,205
Speaker 6:  driving out in, you know, the, the, the desert. One of the videos apparently

98
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:08,205
Speaker 6:  was shown the truck was just being rolled downhill. It was even

99
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:10,365
Speaker 6:  operational. And so it's

100
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,085
Speaker 2:  Kind of amazing, honestly. I know, I know. It's like, it's really, it's like

101
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:16,405
Speaker 2:  not even technically a lie. They're like, we didn't say the car was on, like,

102
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:19,645
Speaker 2:  I, it's just a truck was moving. It was really mo it's, it's just, it's beautiful.

103
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:20,005
Speaker 2:  You just

104
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:23,365
Speaker 6:  Put it in neutral and shoved it down a hill. Just If you assumed that it

105
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:27,125
Speaker 6:  was driving that's, you know, that's on you, not on us. And, you know, and

106
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:30,685
Speaker 6:  a amongst a lot of other things that they had promised, you know, that they

107
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:33,765
Speaker 6:  had said that they were gonna be, this is gonna be a billion dollar com,

108
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:37,045
Speaker 6:  you know, multi-billions of dollars this company was gonna eventually pull

109
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:40,445
Speaker 6:  in. And so yes, they, they filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

110
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:44,845
Speaker 6:  And this came, I wanna say maybe about seven or eight months after

111
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,125
Speaker 6:  the original founder and first CEO of the company, Trevor Milton

112
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:52,525
Speaker 6:  was convicted of, of these of these frauds and

113
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:56,085
Speaker 6:  jailed he's in, he's currently in jail, I believe his sentence was for around

114
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:59,565
Speaker 6:  four years. And so the company was under new different leadership at the

115
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:03,445
Speaker 6:  time, and I think that they had sold around like 600. They

116
00:09:03,445 --> 00:09:06,285
Speaker 6:  eventually got to make it got around to actually making the trucks okay.

117
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:10,125
Speaker 6:  And they sold around 600 of them. But the, the, the environment and

118
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,685
Speaker 6:  the, at the sort of the, the market environment right now for EVs is just

119
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:17,765
Speaker 6:  so upended that some of these smaller companies that

120
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:21,725
Speaker 6:  were kind of like hanging on by a thread already and had sort of

121
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,725
Speaker 6:  other various problems are, are just going to, you know, they're,

122
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:29,205
Speaker 6:  it's, it's gonna be tough for those companies to hang on and to survive given

123
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,485
Speaker 6:  sort of these market and policy forces that are sort of weighing down on

124
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:33,405
Speaker 6:  the industry. And

125
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:36,685
Speaker 2:  Is the lesson in all of this that this really has just been driven

126
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:41,205
Speaker 2:  by politics and policy in both directions, that the reason everybody

127
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,725
Speaker 2:  got excited about it was because we had a government that got excited about

128
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:46,725
Speaker 2:  it. And then the reason is falling apart is because we have a government

129
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:50,325
Speaker 2:  that wants it to fall apart. That actually If you just let the market

130
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:54,325
Speaker 2:  decide, maybe there hasn't really been the EV market, everyone sort of

131
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:55,725
Speaker 2:  assumed was coming. I,

132
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:58,765
Speaker 6:  I I think that that plays a big role, but I think that there's also a lot

133
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,245
Speaker 6:  of responsibility that's on the, the companies and the, the automakers themselves

134
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:06,525
Speaker 6:  who, who were the ones that were out there out front saying that they were

135
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:10,405
Speaker 6:  going to be, that electrification was the future and that they were

136
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:14,205
Speaker 6:  going to be fully electric companies. Like you got companies like gm,

137
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:17,765
Speaker 6:  which you know, is a huge global

138
00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:21,885
Speaker 6:  automaker, makes Cadillac and Chevy and Buick and all of

139
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:25,685
Speaker 6:  these major brands, and they said that they were going to be zero

140
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:29,885
Speaker 6:  emission by 2030, that there was, you know, there was no equivocating

141
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:33,045
Speaker 6:  about this decision, right? And, and all of the other automakers basically

142
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:36,845
Speaker 6:  said something similar. Ford said that it was gonna be zero emission in

143
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:40,805
Speaker 6:  ev only in Europe by 2030. Mercedes said it, BMW,

144
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:44,965
Speaker 6:  all of these major companies coming out and saying, you know, gas is the

145
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:48,805
Speaker 6:  past and electric is the future. And they were fully

146
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:52,605
Speaker 6:  convinced that they were going to be able to be selling these cars hand

147
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:56,045
Speaker 6:  over fist and that customers were just gonna eat it up. That they were gonna

148
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:58,965
Speaker 6:  love the experience of driving EVs, that they were gonna love the ownership

149
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:02,845
Speaker 6:  experience. The only problem is that the, the prices didn't really match

150
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:06,525
Speaker 6:  what the expectations were that they were selling a lot of cars that were

151
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:11,045
Speaker 6:  in the luxury segment at first. And then you got into like the heavy

152
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:15,085
Speaker 6:  trucks like your Hummers and your Ford F-150 Lightnings and

153
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:18,845
Speaker 6:  your Chevy Silverados. And these are giant heavy vehicles with

154
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:22,725
Speaker 6:  big heavy batteries that yeah, they have some pretty decent range

155
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:27,245
Speaker 6:  over 300 miles, but the, the expense associated with getting

156
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:30,965
Speaker 6:  these batteries in these vehicles was just so much that

157
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:33,685
Speaker 6:  customers just sort of balked at the prices that they were, that they were

158
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:37,445
Speaker 6:  seeing that, you know, you could buy a gas powered F-150 for around 30,

159
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:41,285
Speaker 6:  $40,000 at the, at the base model, why would you spend 70

160
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:45,245
Speaker 6:  80 grand on an electric version of that? Yeah. You know, and, and,

161
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,765
Speaker 6:  and when you start towing stuff and doing truck stuff with it, all of a sudden

162
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:52,245
Speaker 6:  that range, that precious range starts to, starts to drop precipitously.

163
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:56,165
Speaker 6:  So it it, it was I think a, a a, a misstep on the part

164
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:59,885
Speaker 6:  of the industry to prioritize the luxury and the, the heavy

165
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:04,005
Speaker 6:  ev heavy truck and SUV assuming that customer preferences

166
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:08,325
Speaker 6:  in the gas market were gonna carry over to the electric market. And then

167
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:12,125
Speaker 6:  you had all of these sort of ev favorable policies from the Biden administration

168
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:16,845
Speaker 6:  that, you know, were instrumental in getting all these factories

169
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:20,645
Speaker 6:  spun up and getting a lot of regionalization companies bringing

170
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,565
Speaker 6:  the production to the US from overseas. It, it had a big

171
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:28,405
Speaker 6:  effort in that and also, you know, and funding the ev charging picture, which

172
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:32,205
Speaker 6:  is another thing altogether. But seeing now how quickly

173
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:35,605
Speaker 6:  all of that kind of stuff can be unwound and un spooled

174
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:39,485
Speaker 6:  by the president administration, I think is giving a lot of these companies

175
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:43,125
Speaker 6:  pause about sort of like banking too much on this certain

176
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,005
Speaker 6:  technology when perhaps the customers aren't there and then the government

177
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:48,485
Speaker 6:  help is not gonna be there as well.

178
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:52,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah. You, you wrote this great story a couple of weeks ago about Ford

179
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:55,285
Speaker 2:  that had, and I don't think I told you this at the time, but it had my favorite

180
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:59,325
Speaker 2:  VERGE headline of like the last 12 months that I feel like also like perfectly

181
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:03,085
Speaker 2:  summed up the EV market. The headline is Ford lost

182
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:06,925
Speaker 2:  $5 billion on EVs in 2024 comma teases new

183
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:11,045
Speaker 2:  models. And so, which just to me, it just perfectly

184
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:14,965
Speaker 2:  sums up the whole thing. And then there was, there was news I think around

185
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:18,765
Speaker 2:  the same time as that, that VW was like, no, no, we're actually

186
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:22,485
Speaker 2:  gonna do the $20,000 ev that we've been promising that everybody

187
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:25,685
Speaker 2:  holds up as this like mythical thing that someday when somebody does that,

188
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:29,565
Speaker 2:  it'll change everything. These companies at some point should

189
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:32,325
Speaker 2:  just look at themselves and be like, nevermind, this didn't work. Maybe it'll

190
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:35,765
Speaker 2:  work someday. We'll like leave a team working on it over there. Can they

191
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:39,245
Speaker 2:  just not help themselves at this point? Like why, why can't these companies

192
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:42,885
Speaker 2:  quit EVs given that right now, if you're just being pragmatic,

193
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:46,885
Speaker 2:  like if you're in pure shareholder value mode,

194
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:51,005
Speaker 2:  it seems like the clear obvious thing to do is spend a lot less time thinking

195
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:51,725
Speaker 2:  about electric cars.

196
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:56,085
Speaker 6:  I, I think fear is playing a big role in, in sort of why it is

197
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:00,045
Speaker 6:  that they're not just giving up entirely. I, I, I think there is

198
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:03,845
Speaker 6:  like an aspect of it that a lot of them do still believe that EVs

199
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:07,525
Speaker 6:  are the future and that this is the right technology to be

200
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:11,325
Speaker 6:  betting all of the money in the companies on that, you know,

201
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:15,405
Speaker 6:  eventually we'll get to a point where We can bring battery costs down and

202
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:19,365
Speaker 6:  ev charging infrastructure will get up to speed and will become something

203
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:23,325
Speaker 6:  that you can actually rely on and that the prices will

204
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:27,245
Speaker 6:  get right. And the, the, the form factor will be spot on. And

205
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:30,245
Speaker 6:  obviously you could have your cake, you eat it too, because this will be

206
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:34,445
Speaker 6:  an environmentally more environmentally friendly technology to bet on zero

207
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:38,525
Speaker 6:  emission If you can find a way to recycle the batteries and get this sort

208
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:42,245
Speaker 6:  of supply chain built up that will encourage people that

209
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:45,125
Speaker 6:  this is actually the technology of the future that they will actually get

210
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,645
Speaker 6:  there. And then there's the fear aspect, which is fear of China in Chinese

211
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:52,245
Speaker 6:  EVs. And we're already sort of starting to see the effect

212
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:56,925
Speaker 6:  less so in the US but definitely in Europe where, you know,

213
00:14:56,925 --> 00:15:00,485
Speaker 6:  Germany, this, you know, country that is, has this

214
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:04,445
Speaker 6:  storied auto sector with, you know, Mercedes and

215
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:08,405
Speaker 6:  BMW and Audi and Volkswagen and all of these, you know, sort of major

216
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:12,405
Speaker 6:  legacy brands are just, you know, in a free fall at the moment because

217
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,205
Speaker 6:  of competition from China, the Chinese companies like

218
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:19,845
Speaker 6:  BYD and Neo and GLI and others are just

219
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:23,965
Speaker 6:  flooding the market with these cheap, affordable

220
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:28,285
Speaker 6:  and honestly pretty fucking cool EVs

221
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:33,125
Speaker 6:  that like everyone that I've read, sources that I trust that have driven

222
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,325
Speaker 6:  these cars and seen them up close and been to China and

223
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:40,645
Speaker 6:  toured the factories and tested the vehicles have said this is they

224
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:44,565
Speaker 6:  crack the code, like, you know, say what you will about government subsidies

225
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:48,525
Speaker 6:  and the, you know, the, the, the Chinese government has got its thumb on

226
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:51,645
Speaker 6:  the scale and is potentially, you know, cheating a little bit in terms of

227
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:54,965
Speaker 6:  like how much money they're pouring into the industry. But it's, it's certainly,

228
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:59,005
Speaker 6:  you know, it's not coming at the expense of like good fun cars

229
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:02,965
Speaker 6:  to drive and, and decent technology. So the, you know, the,

230
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:06,725
Speaker 6:  you know, there's certain vehicles that are, you know, in the 12, $13,000

231
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:10,405
Speaker 6:  range that If you had a vehicle like that available here in the us,

232
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:14,285
Speaker 6:  like it would just eat Ford and GM's lunch, right? Like, there's just no

233
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:18,045
Speaker 6:  question. And Ford Ford's, CEO Jim Farley has, you know, he had a,

234
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:22,085
Speaker 6:  a xmi ev last year that he drove around for like a couple

235
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:25,925
Speaker 6:  months I think, and he saw like the demise of his own company,

236
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:29,805
Speaker 6:  like basically in the future while driving this vehicle that it was just

237
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:33,485
Speaker 6:  such an impressive experience that he's like, there's, we have to catch up

238
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:36,565
Speaker 6:  to these guys because they have beat us. They have been at this for much

239
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:40,245
Speaker 6:  longer than we have. And they have figured out a way to

240
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:44,605
Speaker 6:  bring all the costs in line and, and come up with these, with these cars

241
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:48,445
Speaker 6:  that are just so technologically and design wise

242
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:53,645
Speaker 6:  above the rest. So I think that the rest of the industry, the

243
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:57,685
Speaker 6:  Europeans and the, and the, and the big three here in the US have

244
00:16:57,685 --> 00:17:01,565
Speaker 6:  really no choice if they don't continue to pursue. And like it may

245
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:04,285
Speaker 6:  be like, you know, the Trump administration puts in some policies in place

246
00:17:04,285 --> 00:17:07,965
Speaker 6:  that will like, actively make it like detrimental to their business to,

247
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:11,765
Speaker 6:  to produce EVs, which I could see happening. They will have really no choice

248
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:15,325
Speaker 6:  to just keep pursuing and keep trying to like, you know, throw everything

249
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:19,045
Speaker 6:  that they've got at this problem because otherwise it's, it's literally their

250
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:20,605
Speaker 6:  own futures at that are at stake.

251
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:23,765
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Okay. I think the, the China piece of it, I think I have been

252
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:26,405
Speaker 2:  underwriting in all of this because I keep looking at this thinking, okay,

253
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,885
Speaker 2:  the, the first mover advantage of this already happened, right? Like Tesla

254
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:33,485
Speaker 2:  did that and, and I think has pretty much ridden out its entire advantage

255
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,325
Speaker 2:  on that front by being so far out in front of everybody else. Now we're at

256
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:40,725
Speaker 2:  a point where it's like, okay, if this isn't going mainstream tomorrow,

257
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:44,965
Speaker 2:  what's actually the harm in waiting? And the harm in waiting is that when

258
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:48,365
Speaker 2:  it goes mainstream, China will have already won. Yeah. That we will, it,

259
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:52,285
Speaker 2:  we will be so far behind at that point that it will just like

260
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:55,965
Speaker 2:  China, it it seems like is just sitting there waiting to flood the market

261
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:59,445
Speaker 2:  the minute the market is ready for it to do so. And that's pretty scary if

262
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,605
Speaker 2:  you're, if you're a Volkswagen.

263
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:03,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I was, it was, it was kind of, it was crazy. So I was in Brazil visiting

264
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:07,725
Speaker 6:  some friends last year and you know, at first, you

265
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:11,405
Speaker 6:  know, I saw like a lot of like EO and Renault and like a lot of these like

266
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:15,565
Speaker 6:  European brands out on the road. And then eventually I started to notice

267
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:19,525
Speaker 6:  that like most of the cars that I saw and we were taking Ubers and, and

268
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:21,885
Speaker 6:  you know, rideshare and all that kind of stuff, and they were all Chinese

269
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:26,325
Speaker 6:  EVs, they were BYD, they were Neo and it was just like, it was

270
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:30,285
Speaker 6:  incredible how just like overnight

271
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:33,965
Speaker 6:  apparently like had come in and just like dominated, you know, these markets

272
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:37,685
Speaker 6:  like, like Brazil and others. And I think like, yeah, I think it's like,

273
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:41,645
Speaker 6:  it's certainly the case that you can slap tariffs on every single one and

274
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:45,525
Speaker 6:  Biden has done that and now Trump's talking about doing the same or,

275
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,405
Speaker 6:  or one-upping and trying to make it sort of financially prohibitive for these

276
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:53,325
Speaker 6:  Chinese companies. But the, if the cars are so inexpensive and

277
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:57,245
Speaker 6:  so cheap that, that they literally can absorb the cost of a tariff and

278
00:18:57,245 --> 00:19:01,045
Speaker 6:  still come into the market. Like I don't see how you can eventually stop

279
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:04,445
Speaker 6:  that. And that's something that I think a lot of these companies are in the

280
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:06,165
Speaker 6:  US are deeply afraid of.

281
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:10,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean, a $12,000 car plus a 25% tariff is still

282
00:19:10,175 --> 00:19:12,645
Speaker 2:  gonna win the price worse in a lot of these cases.

283
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:13,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

284
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:15,885
Speaker 2:  Absolutely. That's really interesting. Okay. And so on the, on the other

285
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:19,325
Speaker 2:  hand, as we talk about, you know, things happening sort of slowly and all

286
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,965
Speaker 2:  at once and maybe not, and going back and forth a million times,

287
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:26,695
Speaker 2:  robotaxis, which kind of seemed to be

288
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:29,495
Speaker 2:  having another moment, I, I think

289
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:33,975
Speaker 2:  Joanna Stern on the show at the end of last year predicted that this was

290
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:37,775
Speaker 2:  going to be kind of the year of Waymo. Seems like that might be

291
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:41,175
Speaker 2:  kind of coming true, but also like Lyft and Uber are back in this game.

292
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:45,335
Speaker 2:  Like it's like it's 2016 all over again in the robotaxis

293
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:46,615
Speaker 2:  world. What is happening here?

294
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,095
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's a, it's a weird situation because I think what you've seen is

295
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:53,295
Speaker 6:  that the, the major automakers, you know, like a good

296
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:57,335
Speaker 6:  seven, eight years ago were like, oh, we need to be all in on

297
00:19:58,285 --> 00:20:01,055
Speaker 6:  part, you know, on autonomous vehicles the same way that they, you know,

298
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:02,335
Speaker 6:  missed the boat on EVs.

299
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:06,455
Speaker 2:  It was gonna be by 2020. They were all like, by 2020 we'll be Robotaxis everywhere.

300
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,495
Speaker 6:  Exactly. It was always by 2020. And I seem to recall 2020 being kind of a

301
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:10,375
Speaker 6:  different year. Yeah. I,

302
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:14,095
Speaker 2:  I had a real different experience. I didn't take other taxis very much in

303
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:15,575
Speaker 2:  2020. So I guess that's something people

304
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:18,855
Speaker 6:  Were buying a lot of e-bikes and scooters and not so much robotaxis,

305
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:22,895
Speaker 6:  but yeah, so they were, they were all in on automation. They were like, this

306
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:26,495
Speaker 6:  is gonna be us, we're gonna be, the future of, of the auto industry is gonna

307
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,455
Speaker 6:  be full autonomy. And now they are like, oh, this is just

308
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:33,335
Speaker 6:  taking too long. And it's, it's really expensive actually, and

309
00:20:34,355 --> 00:20:38,055
Speaker 6:  our business is really precarious at, at this moment, so we cannot be

310
00:20:38,515 --> 00:20:42,135
Speaker 6:  so deeply invested in, in, in these sort of like, long-term

311
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:47,285
Speaker 6:  like hyper expensive science experiments. So yeah,

312
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:51,005
Speaker 6:  just recently you had GM completely divesting itself from

313
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:54,565
Speaker 6:  Cruz, and that was after, you know, Cruz having a pretty rough year,

314
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:59,365
Speaker 6:  rough couple years because of some of, you know, the, its cars

315
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:02,445
Speaker 6:  were blocking traffic and were getting on people's nerves in San Francisco

316
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:06,325
Speaker 6:  and then, you know, s a a lady got ran over and that was bad

317
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:06,725
Speaker 6:  on

318
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:10,365
Speaker 2:  That one. By the way, do you, do you read the whole cruise thing as GM

319
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:14,725
Speaker 2:  wanting out of the robotaxis business and deciding that that whole

320
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:18,565
Speaker 2:  idea was just not what it wanted? Or is that like a specific cruise

321
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:19,205
Speaker 2:  problem?

322
00:21:19,665 --> 00:21:22,645
Speaker 6:  Oh no. Yeah. It's, it's the, I would say it's, it's a little bit of both.

323
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:26,685
Speaker 6:  It was okay, it was a, a specific cruise problem. Cruise was known to

324
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:30,605
Speaker 6:  be sort of pushing the envelope and going a bit too aggressive. Yeah. As

325
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:33,885
Speaker 6:  compared to like Waymo and others. They were trying to like get, you know,

326
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:37,405
Speaker 6:  up to speed and, and, and compete and they were sort of, you know,

327
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:42,005
Speaker 6:  not being as buttoned up and safe. Right. Which is like with a, with a

328
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:45,965
Speaker 6:  autonomous vehicle operation, you really have to be as

329
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:50,605
Speaker 6:  cautious and conservative as you possibly can. And that just wasn't

330
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:53,365
Speaker 6:  the ethos at Cruz. They were really trying to

331
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:56,445
Speaker 6:  just, they they were, they were pushing the envelope Yeah.

332
00:21:56,445 --> 00:22:00,005
Speaker 2:  Real, like move fast and break things, which is not a good idea. And robotaxis

333
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:00,245
Speaker 2:  the

334
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:04,045
Speaker 6:  Move fast and break ethos was just, yeah, it was at, at at odds with

335
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:07,125
Speaker 6:  the Yeah. The safety element and they really kind of

336
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:11,205
Speaker 6:  screwed, screwed themselves over with that one. But then also, yeah, that

337
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:14,405
Speaker 6:  was sort of like the big, the big message when GM said that they were gonna

338
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:16,725
Speaker 6:  be getting out of cruise was that, you know, this was not part of our core

339
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:20,885
Speaker 6:  business, which is hilarious because, you know, seven,

340
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:24,765
Speaker 6:  eight years ago, GM said its core business was gonna be zero, zero

341
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:28,845
Speaker 6:  deaths, zero emissions, all this stuff that they were, they were sort of

342
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:32,485
Speaker 6:  like betting the company on the future being, you know, sort of like, no

343
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:35,765
Speaker 6:  more car crashes, no more traffic fatalities, and also no more emissions.

344
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:39,605
Speaker 6:  So autonomy and electrification. And now actually

345
00:22:39,715 --> 00:22:41,485
Speaker 6:  GM's doing pretty good with EVs, but

346
00:22:41,665 --> 00:22:45,565
Speaker 2:  GM just like working backwards from a cool slogan was, was a, an interesting

347
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:46,125
Speaker 2:  move there.

348
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:50,765
Speaker 6:  So, so yeah. So they, so they divested and Cruise is dead now.

349
00:22:51,515 --> 00:22:54,805
Speaker 6:  They absorbed some of the engineers into their Super cruise division, which

350
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:58,165
Speaker 6:  is like their partial automation, their hands off driving assist feature.

351
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:02,525
Speaker 6:  And a lot of these companies now are going all in on like this sort of

352
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:06,245
Speaker 6:  level three, like hands off, eyes off driving on

353
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:09,845
Speaker 6:  highways or in like traffic situations. And that's,

354
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:13,805
Speaker 6:  you know, a huge bag of worms. I mean, like, there's been so many safety

355
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:17,365
Speaker 6:  assessments that show that, that that kind of stuff is extremely dangerous.

356
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:21,845
Speaker 6:  So I, I don't wanna say that like there's, you know, there's a, a whole

357
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:25,085
Speaker 6:  raft of liability concerns that are gonna be coming up, I think in, in, in

358
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:28,845
Speaker 6:  smashing into these companies. No, no pun intended with that. But it, it,

359
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:32,685
Speaker 6:  there there is a lot of potential there as well. Obviously short term revenue,

360
00:23:32,795 --> 00:23:35,645
Speaker 6:  like you could sell options to customers that you have.

361
00:23:36,585 --> 00:23:39,885
Speaker 6:  So really that kind of just leaves Waymo all alone

362
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:43,805
Speaker 6:  in the robotaxis space and they're light years ahead of all the rest of the

363
00:23:43,805 --> 00:23:47,685
Speaker 6:  competition. Like Zoox is still just sort of in, in beta phase and

364
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:50,925
Speaker 6:  like Las Vegas and some others, that's Amazon's robotaxis company

365
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:54,845
Speaker 6:  and there's obviously some Chinese robotaxis companies that are

366
00:23:55,555 --> 00:23:58,925
Speaker 6:  operating Baidu and others in their country.

367
00:23:59,665 --> 00:24:03,285
Speaker 6:  So it's, it seems like really Waymo is, is is way ahead of the rest of the

368
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:05,925
Speaker 6:  competition. And they've, you know, they've got operations in San Francisco

369
00:24:05,925 --> 00:24:09,605
Speaker 6:  and Phoenix and Los Angeles and this year they're launching in Austin

370
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:13,845
Speaker 6:  and Atlanta. And the interesting thing about those launches is that they're

371
00:24:13,845 --> 00:24:17,725
Speaker 6:  gonna be done exclusively with Uber. So instead of using

372
00:24:17,785 --> 00:24:21,685
Speaker 6:  the Waymo app where you've done in previous markets, you'll open up

373
00:24:21,885 --> 00:24:25,805
Speaker 6:  your Uber and potentially you'll get paired with a, a human driver or maybe

374
00:24:26,085 --> 00:24:29,685
Speaker 6:  a robot. Waymo car will be the one to come and pick you up in those, in those

375
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:33,445
Speaker 6:  two cities. So I think that that's why you hear, you've been hearing a lot

376
00:24:33,445 --> 00:24:37,365
Speaker 6:  about, about Robotaxis, but also it's interesting because, you know, you

377
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:40,485
Speaker 6:  have now Uber that is very much a part of the conversation,

378
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:44,285
Speaker 6:  Lyft as well, but Uber obviously is the one that's really trying to make

379
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:47,805
Speaker 6:  itself like the, like the agnostic platform that will take

380
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:51,645
Speaker 6:  anybody's autonomous vehicles. So whether it's Waymo

381
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,565
Speaker 6:  or some of these other companies like AV Ride and some of the other ones

382
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:59,125
Speaker 6:  that are putting out like sidewalk robots for Uber Eats deliveries and others,

383
00:24:59,635 --> 00:25:03,285
Speaker 6:  Uber just wants to be like the, like the neutral party that is just like,

384
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,725
Speaker 6:  we'll, we'll take anyone's robot, you got a robot, put it on our platform.

385
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:09,645
Speaker 6:  Right? We'll take your robot. We'll, we'll we'll give it to, we'll send it

386
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:11,765
Speaker 6:  out to a customer and we'll see how, how it works. Which

387
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:14,685
Speaker 2:  Strikes me as a real lesson learned from the last time around, right? Like

388
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:17,845
Speaker 2:  the, the first time everybody thought Robotaxis were right around the corner,

389
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:22,605
Speaker 2:  all these companies were spending money, they didn't have to own

390
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:25,245
Speaker 2:  the technology themselves. Right? Right. You had Travis Kanick being like,

391
00:25:25,265 --> 00:25:28,845
Speaker 2:  we are fundamentally going to be a self-driving company. It was like, that

392
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:29,325
Speaker 2:  was the, well,

393
00:25:29,325 --> 00:25:32,885
Speaker 6:  It was like an existential right thing for him. He was like, we, we won't

394
00:25:32,885 --> 00:25:36,765
Speaker 6:  exist if we don't design the technology ourselves. And then

395
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:40,805
Speaker 6:  they did that and they killed somebody and they were like, oh wait, no,

396
00:25:41,785 --> 00:25:42,685
Speaker 6:  we changed our minds.

397
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:46,125
Speaker 2:  We want to be a different thing. Yes. And I think, I mean, I I, it's just

398
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:49,005
Speaker 2:  been interesting to me, especially like you said, watching Uber and Lyft

399
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:52,925
Speaker 2:  get back into this because those companies were so wrong a

400
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:56,885
Speaker 2:  decade ago and we're so badly burned by how wrong they were and invested

401
00:25:57,235 --> 00:26:01,085
Speaker 2:  incorrectly so heavily in those directions for so long that I think

402
00:26:01,085 --> 00:26:05,045
Speaker 2:  it really set them back. And so to see them now come back and

403
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:08,605
Speaker 2:  it was like, it was Lyft saying again, like, Lyft is a pretty careful

404
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:11,205
Speaker 2:  company at this point. And so for Lyft to come out and be like,

405
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:16,005
Speaker 2:  Robotaxis, y'all, like we're, we're ready. We're doing, it was just so

406
00:26:16,245 --> 00:26:18,645
Speaker 2:  interesting to me. This company is like finally making money for the first

407
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:22,525
Speaker 2:  time in its history and they're like, so robotaxis. So it's like, there

408
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:23,965
Speaker 2:  must be something here. It's,

409
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:27,125
Speaker 6:  I think it's, it's a, it's a couple things. So I think for one it's that

410
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:31,005
Speaker 6:  Uber and Lyft are now sort of like newly profitable. Uber is,

411
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:35,005
Speaker 6:  is profitable. Lyft is, it had just had, its like its first profitable

412
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:38,765
Speaker 6:  year, their cashflow positive. They finally, after like over

413
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:42,685
Speaker 6:  a decade and a half have have figured out how to make money off of,

414
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:47,125
Speaker 6:  off of Rideshare. And so they've got like, you know, they, they're kind

415
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:49,485
Speaker 6:  of like, they're feeling themselves a little bit. Yeah. I think in, in one

416
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:52,485
Speaker 6:  respect. And then the other respect is, I think is is is the, is the market

417
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:55,765
Speaker 6:  in, and investors are really kind of pushing them towards this because every

418
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:59,725
Speaker 6:  time Waymo makes a, some sort of, you know, iterative announcement

419
00:26:59,725 --> 00:27:02,845
Speaker 6:  about like going into a new market or a new city, it's saying like, we're

420
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:06,805
Speaker 6:  gonna be in Miami or we're gonna be in this city. You see that

421
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:10,565
Speaker 6:  that reflected in Uber's share price, right? Like Uber's stock starts to

422
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:14,445
Speaker 6:  go down a little bit. So Uber feels a little bit like pressure to pair up

423
00:27:14,445 --> 00:27:17,925
Speaker 6:  with these companies as a way to keep them close to them so that they can

424
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:21,845
Speaker 6:  be part of this conversation. They can be part of sort of how this technology

425
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:25,405
Speaker 6:  rolls out if they're the ones that are sort of like at the front line of

426
00:27:25,405 --> 00:27:29,325
Speaker 6:  being in between the customer and the robotaxis. They see

427
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:31,965
Speaker 6:  that as like a benefit to them that they, they get like sort of like the

428
00:27:32,205 --> 00:27:35,885
Speaker 6:  positive vibe, you know, sort of like ricochet off of, you know, the, the

429
00:27:35,885 --> 00:27:39,485
Speaker 6:  experience of writing in a Waymo like, oh, this is so fun. I get to, you

430
00:27:39,485 --> 00:27:43,085
Speaker 6:  know, control my music and there's nobody in the front seat. And it's, it's

431
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:47,045
Speaker 6:  so unique and different and wow. And, and you know, maybe

432
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:50,125
Speaker 6:  you associate that all a hundred percent with Waymo, but maybe you get like,

433
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:53,125
Speaker 6:  you know, a little bit a a little nudge to, to Uber as well. And so Uber

434
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:56,285
Speaker 6:  gets something out of that. So, so Waymo

435
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:59,765
Speaker 2:  Is really like the, the boogeyman of this whole industry. Like everybody

436
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:03,445
Speaker 2:  who's doing any of this is just watching Waymo essentially have unlimited

437
00:28:03,445 --> 00:28:07,325
Speaker 2:  time and money and resources to do this. And is I, I assume

438
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:10,205
Speaker 2:  anyone else working on any part of this is petrified of what's going on at

439
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:10,485
Speaker 2:  Waymo,

440
00:28:10,585 --> 00:28:14,005
Speaker 6:  And yet they like operate at a like fraction of a fraction of the levels

441
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:17,925
Speaker 6:  that Uber does. Hmm. Waymo's got like less than

442
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:20,005
Speaker 6:  a thousand cars on the road today. Oh,

443
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,085
Speaker 2:  Interesting. I didn't realize that. Okay.

444
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:25,005
Speaker 6:  And Uber is doing, like, just recently did like, it's like

445
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:29,085
Speaker 6:  1000000th, concurrent ride. Like, it's like Wow. All over the world. Yeah,

446
00:28:29,235 --> 00:28:33,085
Speaker 6:  it's taken in taxied cabs now. It's, you know, it's like fully eaten

447
00:28:33,105 --> 00:28:36,925
Speaker 6:  the rideshare and like the, the, the, the vehicle transportation market

448
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:41,325
Speaker 6:  and, and Uber is just like so small in,

449
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:45,525
Speaker 6:  it's like, it boggles my mind some too because like it's got like,

450
00:28:45,595 --> 00:28:48,685
Speaker 6:  it's got great, you know, sort of like brand value in the terms of like Yeah.

451
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,245
Speaker 6:  People like associate are, are starting to like, you know, like fully

452
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:56,045
Speaker 6:  associate, like a Waymo has become like the Xerox or like the Kleenex of

453
00:28:56,045 --> 00:29:00,005
Speaker 6:  totally. Of like Robotaxis and that that there's, there is

454
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:03,845
Speaker 6:  certainly value involved in that. But yeah, given how like how few

455
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:07,325
Speaker 6:  cities they're actually, and how slowly and conservatively

456
00:29:07,535 --> 00:29:10,285
Speaker 6:  which they have to, they have to do that because they don't wanna fall into

457
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:14,205
Speaker 6:  the same pitfalls right. As Cruz or as Uber did. They

458
00:29:14,205 --> 00:29:14,325
Speaker 6:  can

459
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:15,565
Speaker 2:  Also afford to importantly,

460
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:18,365
Speaker 6:  And they, I I mean may maybe,

461
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:19,005
Speaker 2:  I mean

462
00:29:19,005 --> 00:29:20,085
Speaker 6:  Fair, I mean like If you seen

463
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:21,805
Speaker 2:  Also that certainly has the money. I is all

464
00:29:21,805 --> 00:29:23,685
Speaker 6:  All, I mean, I know if you've seen like the other bets and stuff like that,

465
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:27,405
Speaker 6:  like, you know, where they list like the losses there, like it's not, it's

466
00:29:27,405 --> 00:29:30,845
Speaker 6:  not looking good. Like they're still losing hundreds of millions of dollars

467
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:32,165
Speaker 6:  on this project. Right. But

468
00:29:32,165 --> 00:29:36,085
Speaker 2:  They're, they're, they're I suppose at risk of running out of corporate

469
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:38,845
Speaker 2:  patients Yes. But they're not at risk of running out of money. That's really

470
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:41,845
Speaker 6:  All Yeah. It's a very different situation than Cruise with GM where GM was

471
00:29:41,845 --> 00:29:45,085
Speaker 6:  just like, our margins are so incredibly tight that we just cannot continue

472
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:48,525
Speaker 6:  to fund this thing. Whereas alphabet's like Sure, five more billion dollars

473
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:50,765
Speaker 6:  for the next five years. Sure. Why not Minutes

474
00:29:50,765 --> 00:29:52,325
Speaker 2:  Of running Google. Like it'll be fine. Yeah,

475
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:55,925
Speaker 6:  Exactly. So yeah, it is, it is. And I think like, it, it one could see the

476
00:29:55,925 --> 00:29:59,885
Speaker 6:  same with Amazon too, right? Like Amazon can continue to fund like money

477
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:03,445
Speaker 6:  losing operation like Zoox for Right. Which like Zoox is an interesting player

478
00:30:03,445 --> 00:30:07,165
Speaker 6:  because we just had a, a piece that ran where our freelancer Abigail

479
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:11,045
Speaker 6:  Bassett rode in one in Las Vegas during CES. They, they're taking

480
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:14,005
Speaker 6:  a different tack. They're like, we, it's actually purpose built vehicles.

481
00:30:14,005 --> 00:30:17,765
Speaker 6:  It's these vehicles that look kind of like weird toaster shaped things and

482
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:20,685
Speaker 6:  they don't have, they don't have pedals and they don't have steering wheels

483
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:23,685
Speaker 6:  and you sort of like sit on these bench seats facing each other. It's

484
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:27,605
Speaker 2:  Like the foursome seat on a train that faces each other made into a vehicle,

485
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:30,125
Speaker 6:  Which are, they're always the worst seats on the train. Yeah, they're awful.

486
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:33,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like nobody ever wants to, like, when your knees bump up against the

487
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,925
Speaker 6:  other person's knees and it's just like, ugh, sucks.

488
00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:36,085
Speaker 2:  Everybody wants that. I hate this.

489
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah, perfect. Yeah. So that's what Zoox is going for

490
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:43,445
Speaker 6:  and that was interestingly what Cruise was also going for at first until

491
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:46,725
Speaker 6:  everything fell apart for them. So it's interesting because, you know, and

492
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:50,085
Speaker 6:  Waymo's got, you know, its future platforms. They've got a deal with

493
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:54,085
Speaker 6:  GLI to make these zeer vehicles, but that could get seriously compromised

494
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,925
Speaker 6:  by the Chinese tariffs. They've got deals with Hyundai to use Hyundai's Iion

495
00:30:57,995 --> 00:31:01,805
Speaker 6:  five as a, as a vehicle. So there, you know,

496
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:04,725
Speaker 6:  there's, everyone's got, you know, is putting their, placing their bets.

497
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:08,485
Speaker 6:  And I think interestingly, Waymo being the one so far out ahead on the technology

498
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:11,565
Speaker 6:  is still like we need regular cars that We can just retrofit. We are not

499
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:15,365
Speaker 6:  ready to go like the purpose, purpose-built direction quite

500
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:17,565
Speaker 6:  yet, which I think is is quite telling.

501
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:22,165
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. All right. Before I let you go, let's do 90 seconds on

502
00:31:22,165 --> 00:31:26,045
Speaker 2:  Tesla because All right. I think a, a lot of this, like a lot of everything

503
00:31:26,045 --> 00:31:28,925
Speaker 2:  we've talked about is Tesla is wrapped up in,

504
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:34,375
Speaker 2:  but it's, the company's in an odd place, right? The, the last quarter

505
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:38,615
Speaker 2:  was fine, but not great sales are down year, over the year for

506
00:31:38,615 --> 00:31:41,135
Speaker 2:  the first time in forever maybe ever. Yeah. Was it ever

507
00:31:41,455 --> 00:31:43,615
Speaker 6:  I think it's like an over a decade basically. Okay. It's

508
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:43,815
Speaker 2:  Like a

509
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:45,495
Speaker 6:  Long since they've been profitable. Yeah. It's

510
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:49,375
Speaker 2:  The first time. Yeah. And I think also Teslas have been sort

511
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:53,295
Speaker 2:  of political statements in a variety of ways for a long time now, but

512
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:57,095
Speaker 2:  that has really escalated. Like what, what's your read on sort of the, the

513
00:31:57,095 --> 00:32:00,535
Speaker 2:  market vibes around Tesla right now? How, what, what's going on inside that

514
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:00,695
Speaker 2:  company?

515
00:32:00,915 --> 00:32:04,855
Speaker 6:  So yeah, I mean like stock price wise, it's not doing too great. It's definitely

516
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:08,735
Speaker 6:  down, I think this year, year over year. And yeah, as you mentioned, sales,

517
00:32:08,825 --> 00:32:12,775
Speaker 6:  sales are down and the vibes are off, you could say.

518
00:32:13,175 --> 00:32:16,095
Speaker 6:  I mean, you know, I feel like I've been like writing the same story for like

519
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:19,455
Speaker 6:  five, six years now about the vibes being off at Tesla, but now the vibes

520
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:23,335
Speaker 6:  are seriously off and that's obviously due entirely to Elon Musk and

521
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:26,895
Speaker 6:  his new found prominence as, you know, as

522
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:31,055
Speaker 6:  Trump's hatchet guy. So it's, it's, yeah, it's, it's like, you know,

523
00:32:31,355 --> 00:32:35,255
Speaker 6:  you once had you, it was a brand that was once associated with like

524
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:39,015
Speaker 6:  California liberals and as a, as sort of like a statement about

525
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,010
Speaker 6:  like how what you thought about like the environment and climate change and

526
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,605
Speaker 6:  the future and technology and, and now it's like fully

527
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:49,725
Speaker 6:  like a MAGA brand, but it's not though because MAGA people will not

528
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:53,085
Speaker 6:  buy Teslas and they're not interested in buying Teslas. They still like their

529
00:32:53,085 --> 00:32:56,845
Speaker 6:  trucks and their SUVs. So it's in a very leaves sort of Tesla,

530
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,485
Speaker 6:  the, the company in like a very weird limbo space right now where,

531
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:05,725
Speaker 6:  you know, the this, it's, it's sort of like unsure of what's gonna,

532
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:09,685
Speaker 6:  what, what it's gonna take in order to, to sort of like reset the

533
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:12,965
Speaker 6:  narrative, I guess. And I, I think one of the things is the cyber cab, which

534
00:33:13,315 --> 00:33:17,245
Speaker 6:  came out last year, and Musk has said that it's going to, you know, sort

535
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:21,045
Speaker 6:  of start doing Robotaxis rides in Austin starting this

536
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:22,565
Speaker 6:  summer Right. Big

537
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:24,085
Speaker 2:  Year for Austin and Robotaxis.

538
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it seems that way. Yeah. But, you know, Tesla's approach to autonomy

539
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:31,765
Speaker 6:  very different than Waymo. You know, they have been, it's a camera only

540
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:35,685
Speaker 6:  system, you know, it relies on its full self-driving hardware and

541
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:39,085
Speaker 6:  software. And there's a lot of concerns about sort of like the safety of

542
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:42,645
Speaker 6:  that technology. Tesla famously a company that does not like to accept

543
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:46,485
Speaker 6:  liability for crashes that occur with its vehicles. That's gonna be a really

544
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:49,685
Speaker 6:  interesting thing to watch going forward as, as they start to take drivers

545
00:33:49,825 --> 00:33:53,805
Speaker 6:  out from behind the steering wheel and offer rides to people as

546
00:33:53,805 --> 00:33:57,645
Speaker 6:  part of like a, a fleet service, very different business for them. It, it'll

547
00:33:57,645 --> 00:34:00,845
Speaker 6:  be really interesting to see how, how they navigate that. And then you've

548
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:04,365
Speaker 6:  got like this promise for this next gen platform or this

549
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:08,365
Speaker 6:  more mass market vehicle, you know, they've, there's been talk about, you

550
00:34:08,365 --> 00:34:12,165
Speaker 6:  know, a model two now it seems like that's, that's being replaced by

551
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:16,085
Speaker 6:  something called the Model Q. It's, it's unclear exactly what

552
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:19,725
Speaker 6:  that's gonna look like if, if it's just like a model three or a model y

553
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:23,685
Speaker 6:  that's like a little bit cheaper and a little bit more, less, less kind

554
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:26,685
Speaker 6:  of like technologically advanced, a little more

555
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:27,125
Speaker 2:  Carish

556
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:31,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Than like the current models. Yeah. So it's we're it's really unclear

557
00:39:03,185 --> 00:39:07,035
Speaker 2:  Alright, we're back. Now I wanna talk about Activity Pub

558
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:10,915
Speaker 2:  because I cannot help myself from talking about The Fediverse and the Open

559
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,395
Speaker 2:  Social web and all of the different ways that we might

560
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:18,555
Speaker 2:  interact with each other. Evan Promo is a person I've talked to before about

561
00:39:18,555 --> 00:39:22,435
Speaker 2:  this stuff because he is one of the people actually in charge of maintaining

562
00:39:22,455 --> 00:39:26,315
Speaker 2:  the activity pub protocol that underpins Mastodon

563
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:30,435
Speaker 2:  and Flipboard Surf. And a lot of this fediverse stuff that we've been

564
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:34,195
Speaker 2:  talking about for the last couple of years, they're not quite the same, The

565
00:39:34,195 --> 00:39:37,515
Speaker 2:  Fediverse and Activity Pub, but a lot of what's happening on The Fediverse

566
00:39:37,815 --> 00:39:41,395
Speaker 2:  is happening because of Activity Pub. It's what Threads is invested in, it's

567
00:39:41,395 --> 00:39:45,075
Speaker 2:  what Medium has been working on. It's what Tumblr and WordPress are going

568
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:48,915
Speaker 2:  to. This is kind of the protocol, the underlying infrastructure that

569
00:39:48,915 --> 00:39:52,835
Speaker 2:  might make all of this work. And Evan is not only in

570
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:56,555
Speaker 2:  charge of helping make sure that the protocol works, he's trying to convince

571
00:39:56,555 --> 00:39:59,475
Speaker 2:  the world to use it. So I figured it'd be a fun time to catch up with him,

572
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:03,835
Speaker 2:  see how all of it's going, and see where this is headed. Let's

573
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:07,585
Speaker 2:  get into it. I think the place I wanna start is

574
00:40:08,555 --> 00:40:11,885
Speaker 2:  sort of in the, in the deep tech of Activity hub

575
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:15,765
Speaker 2:  and we're gonna, we're gonna sort of build out from the base of the technology

576
00:40:15,865 --> 00:40:18,765
Speaker 2:  out into taking over the world. Oh

577
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:19,045
Speaker 10:  Boy.

578
00:40:20,265 --> 00:40:23,405
Speaker 2:  You're, one of the things that you spend your time on is thinking about what

579
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:27,085
Speaker 2:  this protocol is and how it's supposed to work and what

580
00:40:27,245 --> 00:40:30,965
Speaker 2:  is going on, what is new with Activity Pub, how is the protocol

581
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:33,085
Speaker 2:  work going at like the deepest level these days?

582
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:37,635
Speaker 10:  Well, there's a lot that's new happening with Activity Pub.

583
00:40:38,215 --> 00:40:42,155
Speaker 10:  So just to like, you know, pull back for a second. Activity

584
00:40:42,175 --> 00:40:44,875
Speaker 10:  Pub is the protocol that lets

585
00:40:45,975 --> 00:40:49,795
Speaker 10:  the network of independent heterogeneous

586
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:53,995
Speaker 10:  social platforms that we call The fediverse talk to each other.

587
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:58,155
Speaker 10:  So it is the streams of activities and

588
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:01,875
Speaker 10:  contents that go from one social platform to the other. And

589
00:41:02,345 --> 00:41:05,675
Speaker 10:  when it was initially developed, it was developed for

590
00:41:06,265 --> 00:41:09,875
Speaker 10:  kind of a, a, a very straightforward idea

591
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:14,195
Speaker 10:  of social networking, right? I create an image

592
00:41:14,335 --> 00:41:18,195
Speaker 10:  or some text, you reply to it, maybe like it

593
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:21,875
Speaker 10:  or share it. We had a fairly limited number

594
00:41:22,255 --> 00:41:25,635
Speaker 10:  of interesting objects and

595
00:41:25,635 --> 00:41:27,955
Speaker 10:  activities that you could share across this network.

596
00:41:28,495 --> 00:41:30,795
Speaker 2:  So actually, can I pause you on that really fast? Yeah, go ahead. This is

597
00:41:30,795 --> 00:41:33,845
Speaker 2:  a thing I've always wondered about Activity Pub and have never asked somebody

598
00:41:33,845 --> 00:41:35,245
Speaker 2:  and you're the perfect person to ask this question

599
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:40,805
Speaker 2:  that focus the idea that this, this thing should be essentially

600
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:43,765
Speaker 2:  about social networking in a, in a sort of

601
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,405
Speaker 2:  Twitter posts kind of way. Yeah. Was that

602
00:41:47,955 --> 00:41:50,485
Speaker 2:  intentional? Like was there, was there a meeting at the very beginning that

603
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:53,725
Speaker 2:  was like, let's keep this thing simple and focused and straightforward

604
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:57,645
Speaker 2:  because now it's like you can look at Activity pub and sort of make it anything.

605
00:41:57,705 --> 00:42:00,565
Speaker 2:  And I think there are people who kind of want to make it anything and I want

606
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:04,485
Speaker 2:  to talk about that, but like how deliberate was the idea that it's like let's

607
00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:07,285
Speaker 2:  keep this in a sort of box that we understand on the internet.

608
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:11,805
Speaker 10:  I, I think there's two sides to it, right? I think we wanted

609
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:15,805
Speaker 10:  to at least be able to cover that very simple idea

610
00:42:15,865 --> 00:42:19,805
Speaker 10:  of like, you know, I post a lot of tweets and people can reply and

611
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:20,125
Speaker 10:  like them,

612
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:25,365
Speaker 10:  but we wanted to also make it extensible so we could cover

613
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:29,085
Speaker 10:  different kinds of social interactions. Okay. Right.

614
00:42:30,065 --> 00:42:33,725
Speaker 10:  And things that have changed, you know, in the time

615
00:42:33,975 --> 00:42:37,725
Speaker 10:  since Activity Pub was created are things

616
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:41,605
Speaker 10:  like stories that we see in Snap or Instagram or

617
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:45,645
Speaker 10:  Facebook or other kinds of interactions. Geo

618
00:42:45,645 --> 00:42:49,045
Speaker 10:  social interactions like Swarm or

619
00:42:49,045 --> 00:42:52,965
Speaker 10:  Foursquare is a, is another one being able to do check-ins. And

620
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:56,845
Speaker 10:  so there are new kinds of interactions

621
00:42:57,955 --> 00:43:01,605
Speaker 10:  that we send over that wire now, but

622
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:05,685
Speaker 10:  it's the same wire and it's the same kind of

623
00:43:05,685 --> 00:43:09,335
Speaker 10:  packets. We've just like made an extensibility

624
00:43:09,405 --> 00:43:12,935
Speaker 10:  mechanism that makes it possible to define new kinds of packets.

625
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:16,895
Speaker 2:  Okay. And in theory, as long as you can do one of those things

626
00:43:17,605 --> 00:43:21,295
Speaker 2:  well and reliably across that wire building new ones shouldn't be

627
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:24,375
Speaker 2:  as hard. Like you don't have to reinvent every wheel every time.

628
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:28,415
Speaker 10:  Exactly. Okay. Absolutely. Yeah. So the idea is that you should be like

629
00:43:28,415 --> 00:43:32,055
Speaker 10:  95% of the way there and If you wanna start defining new

630
00:43:32,065 --> 00:43:35,415
Speaker 10:  kinds of interactions, you don't have to start from the ground up. You can

631
00:43:35,415 --> 00:43:38,895
Speaker 10:  start at this very high level of like social interactions.

632
00:43:39,275 --> 00:43:41,975
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. That's a good answer. Yeah. So I, I derailed you from talking

633
00:43:41,975 --> 00:43:43,775
Speaker 2:  about what's, what's been going on recently.

634
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:48,095
Speaker 10:  Yeah. So there are quite a few interesting things going on

635
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:53,295
Speaker 10:  recently. I, I realized that these can

636
00:43:53,355 --> 00:43:57,215
Speaker 10:  be exciting for me, not necessarily exciting for everyone in the world.

637
00:43:57,595 --> 00:44:01,295
Speaker 10:  One of the ones that's, that was recently announced is that

638
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:05,575
Speaker 10:  Masson and other services are gonna be supporting quote

639
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:09,095
Speaker 10:  posts, right? So quote tweet like posts

640
00:44:10,095 --> 00:44:11,295
Speaker 2:  Slightly controversial decision

641
00:44:11,695 --> 00:44:15,135
Speaker 10:  Slightly controversial, right? A very interesting thing And one of the things

642
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:18,735
Speaker 10:  that, you know, the, like Fediverse can be kind of

643
00:44:19,025 --> 00:44:22,615
Speaker 10:  Amish in the way that it approaches technology sometimes. Yeah. Right. Where

644
00:44:22,615 --> 00:44:26,255
Speaker 10:  it's like, hey, we're considering this new type of

645
00:44:26,365 --> 00:44:30,095
Speaker 10:  interaction, is this actually good for our

646
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:34,525
Speaker 10:  community, for our social benefit? So there were some concern about quote

647
00:44:34,535 --> 00:44:37,285
Speaker 10:  posts, whether they would be primarily for like

648
00:44:38,235 --> 00:44:42,085
Speaker 10:  dunking and holding people up to ridicule. And

649
00:44:42,925 --> 00:44:46,805
Speaker 10:  I think that we've kind of coalesced around some ideas about quote

650
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:50,725
Speaker 10:  posts that would give the quoted person some

651
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:54,765
Speaker 10:  control in how that they're talked about. Interesting. Okay. And so I think

652
00:44:54,765 --> 00:44:58,725
Speaker 10:  that's a nice like kind of compromise that's come up there. So

653
00:44:58,725 --> 00:45:01,965
Speaker 10:  that's one that's really interesting. Well it, it's interesting 'cause it's

654
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:05,005
Speaker 10:  gonna have kind of broad use. Yeah. But the

655
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:10,085
Speaker 10:  W three C, the Worldwide Web Consortium, which is the organization that

656
00:45:10,395 --> 00:45:14,325
Speaker 10:  established the Activity pub standard, is working on

657
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:18,165
Speaker 10:  a number of new types of interaction. So one

658
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:21,885
Speaker 10:  that's very important is end-to-end encrypted

659
00:45:22,355 --> 00:45:25,965
Speaker 10:  messaging, end-to-end encrypted messaging has

660
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:28,045
Speaker 10:  become the default for

661
00:45:29,905 --> 00:45:33,845
Speaker 10:  DMS across systems. So If you use Facebook Messenger

662
00:45:34,105 --> 00:45:37,645
Speaker 10:  or WhatsApp or Signal, those are all end to end

663
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:41,605
Speaker 10:  encrypted from your my phone to your phone. I can read it

664
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:45,565
Speaker 10:  on my phone, you can read it on your phone. Nobody in between can read

665
00:45:45,565 --> 00:45:49,485
Speaker 10:  it. Right. And that is the type of topology that we

666
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:53,165
Speaker 10:  want to see with end-to-end encrypted dms in The Fediverse

667
00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:57,285
Speaker 10:  also. So that's some work that started middle of last year,

668
00:45:57,655 --> 00:46:01,605
Speaker 10:  we're heading into doing like first implementations and definitions around

669
00:46:01,605 --> 00:46:04,925
Speaker 10:  it. And that's a really exciting step

670
00:46:05,115 --> 00:46:08,325
Speaker 10:  because it lets people have a level of

671
00:46:08,555 --> 00:46:12,525
Speaker 10:  interaction and trust that they wouldn't otherwise have. Right. Right. So

672
00:46:12,705 --> 00:46:16,445
Speaker 10:  people are starting off conversations on The Fediverse and moving

673
00:46:16,545 --> 00:46:20,445
Speaker 10:  to like a signal or a WhatsApp and this would let them kind of have their

674
00:46:20,905 --> 00:46:24,805
Speaker 10:  DM interface happened right there. I mentioned

675
00:46:24,945 --> 00:46:28,885
Speaker 10:  geo social work, right? That's something that has kind of like

676
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:32,845
Speaker 10:  in the early 2010s was very exciting. Yeah. And

677
00:46:33,105 --> 00:46:37,045
Speaker 10:  it was a, an area of sociality that kind of fell by

678
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:40,805
Speaker 10:  the wayside. You know, I think only, like, I still use

679
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:44,925
Speaker 10:  Swarm, I use it all the time, but you know, not a lot of

680
00:46:44,925 --> 00:46:48,725
Speaker 10:  other folks do. We do check-ins on Facebook, but it's not as

681
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:52,525
Speaker 10:  big a deal as it was was, but there's some fun exploration of it

682
00:46:52,615 --> 00:46:56,485
Speaker 10:  going on at the W three C. So there's a task force that's just

683
00:46:56,485 --> 00:47:00,005
Speaker 10:  focused on geo social work, doing check-ins,

684
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:03,565
Speaker 10:  collecting, you know, information around a

685
00:47:04,565 --> 00:47:08,525
Speaker 10:  geographical area. Another area that's that's

686
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:11,445
Speaker 10:  being explored right now is groups. Mm. So

687
00:47:12,675 --> 00:47:16,645
Speaker 10:  it's been a little tough to do. Facebook style

688
00:47:16,645 --> 00:47:20,085
Speaker 10:  groups are such an important part about how, how people

689
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:24,645
Speaker 10:  have social interactions, you know, Facebook specifically Facebook

690
00:47:24,645 --> 00:47:25,485
Speaker 10:  groups. I was gonna

691
00:47:25,485 --> 00:47:28,085
Speaker 2:  Say, it's the reason everyone I know is still on Facebook. Like it It is,

692
00:47:28,085 --> 00:47:32,005
Speaker 2:  yeah, exactly. It is the single stickiest thing about the stickiest app in

693
00:47:32,005 --> 00:47:34,245
Speaker 2:  the world. Like it's it's wild. It's really true.

694
00:47:34,675 --> 00:47:38,605
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Yeah. And people really love working with 'em. You get other kinds

695
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:42,365
Speaker 10:  of groups, so like Reddit, Reddit sub subreddits and the

696
00:47:42,395 --> 00:47:46,205
Speaker 10:  idea is to have that kind of community process that

697
00:47:46,555 --> 00:47:50,445
Speaker 10:  crosses different social platforms. So people from Mastodon,

698
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:54,725
Speaker 10:  from Threads, from Flipboard, from WordPress can

699
00:47:54,725 --> 00:47:58,365
Speaker 10:  all be in the same group. Right. And still participating together,

700
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,925
Speaker 10:  which is a really cool, interesting part, right? Like your

701
00:48:02,725 --> 00:48:06,325
Speaker 10:  choice of platform doesn't necessarily dictate which

702
00:48:06,325 --> 00:48:10,045
Speaker 10:  groups that you can be part of. And so

703
00:48:10,115 --> 00:48:13,645
Speaker 10:  that, that work has started in December

704
00:48:13,945 --> 00:48:17,485
Speaker 10:  of last year and we're starting to spec that out. The

705
00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:21,445
Speaker 10:  activity pub spec actually included some group information in it. So, but

706
00:48:21,445 --> 00:48:24,885
Speaker 10:  there haven't been a lot of in implementations, so getting to

707
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:29,725
Speaker 10:  better definition and more implementations

708
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:31,005
Speaker 10:  is kind of the big step there.

709
00:48:31,345 --> 00:48:34,805
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. That's more stuff than I thought you were gonna say. I think

710
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:38,325
Speaker 2:  like truthfully, I think one of the things I expected you to say is

711
00:48:39,305 --> 00:48:43,045
Speaker 2:  we are in a sort of happy, optimistic sounding

712
00:48:43,085 --> 00:48:46,405
Speaker 2:  maintenance mode. Like we just have to keep hardening this thing and make

713
00:48:46,405 --> 00:48:48,885
Speaker 2:  it work and make sure it supports all the things that it needs to. And like

714
00:48:48,955 --> 00:48:52,045
Speaker 2:  this is new and it's growing really fast and but you're out here being like,

715
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:54,565
Speaker 2:  we're just attaching new stuff to this all the time. Like that's a, it's

716
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:55,645
Speaker 2:  a, it's a different kind of head space.

717
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:59,965
Speaker 10:  There is, I mean those are some of the interesting parts

718
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:03,445
Speaker 10:  of what's happening. Sure. In terms of like new functionality, new stuff

719
00:49:03,445 --> 00:49:07,245
Speaker 10:  happening. I think there are other parts that are also

720
00:49:07,395 --> 00:49:11,125
Speaker 10:  like coming up that are challenging that we're

721
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:13,045
Speaker 10:  kind of dealing with as, as we go

722
00:49:14,635 --> 00:49:17,845
Speaker 10:  last. You know, last year was really the year that we started

723
00:49:17,845 --> 00:49:21,685
Speaker 10:  incorporating Threads into The Fediverse Threads being the big

724
00:49:22,355 --> 00:49:26,285
Speaker 10:  meta product that's, you know, shot up in terms I think there are over

725
00:49:26,335 --> 00:49:29,525
Speaker 10:  300 million people, 325, something like that.

726
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,765
Speaker 10:  And that has put a lot of pressure on the rest of The fediverse to be able

727
00:49:33,765 --> 00:49:35,685
Speaker 10:  to encompass having such a big node.

728
00:49:37,785 --> 00:49:41,515
Speaker 10:  Largely it's worked pretty well because of the way that activity

729
00:49:41,615 --> 00:49:45,515
Speaker 10:  pub is, is defined. You make your subscriptions to a

730
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:49,195
Speaker 10:  person not a service. So if I follow

731
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:54,235
Speaker 10:  POTUS at Threads, which was a really great idea a few months

732
00:49:54,235 --> 00:49:58,115
Speaker 10:  ago, it is less interesting now, but like if I follow POTUS at Threads,

733
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:02,195
Speaker 10:  I'm able to get just that one person's posts.

734
00:50:02,195 --> 00:50:02,395
Speaker 10:  Right.

735
00:50:02,395 --> 00:50:05,595
Speaker 2:  You don't have to digest the whole Threads database every time you wanna

736
00:50:05,595 --> 00:50:05,835
Speaker 2:  pull

737
00:50:05,835 --> 00:50:09,795
Speaker 10:  For I'm not get Yeah, exactly. Which is just too much for a little mast

738
00:50:09,795 --> 00:50:12,915
Speaker 10:  on server running on somebody's raspberry pie. So we're able to kind of

739
00:50:12,915 --> 00:50:16,835
Speaker 10:  make this, make this work pretty well. I think the other

740
00:50:16,845 --> 00:50:17,715
Speaker 10:  thing, and

741
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:23,155
Speaker 10:  this has been more about implementation than about standards,

742
00:50:23,415 --> 00:50:27,215
Speaker 10:  has been the growth of Blue Sky, right? Hmm. So Blue Sky

743
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:31,255
Speaker 10:  really after the election in, in November

744
00:50:31,475 --> 00:50:35,295
Speaker 10:  has had this explosive growth. It is Blue Sky is

745
00:50:35,295 --> 00:50:39,015
Speaker 10:  part of The Fediverse, right? It is linked through a

746
00:50:39,015 --> 00:50:42,895
Speaker 10:  two-way bridge into the activity pub world. So there's a wonderful

747
00:50:43,115 --> 00:50:46,975
Speaker 10:  bridge that lets you follow people on Blue Sky,

748
00:50:47,205 --> 00:50:50,695
Speaker 10:  like what they post, respond to them, et cetera. It's a very,

749
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:55,095
Speaker 10:  it very much puts them on an equal footing with other parts of The fediverse.

750
00:50:55,465 --> 00:50:57,935
Speaker 2:  Let's talk about that actually before we get Sure. I was gonna ask you about

751
00:50:57,935 --> 00:51:00,975
Speaker 2:  Blue Sky later, but No problem. But no, We can, We can talk about it now

752
00:51:01,055 --> 00:51:05,015
Speaker 2:  'cause I think it's, it's, it's a really interesting part of this story because

753
00:51:05,335 --> 00:51:09,015
Speaker 2:  I knew you were gonna say it's terrific and we're, everybody's so happy and

754
00:51:09,015 --> 00:51:12,055
Speaker 2:  it's all great, but like there is a real world in which

755
00:51:12,965 --> 00:51:16,855
Speaker 2:  Blue Sky and the, the AT protocol are like a threat

756
00:51:16,855 --> 00:51:20,695
Speaker 2:  competitor, whatever you wanna call it, to what Activity Pub

757
00:51:20,695 --> 00:51:24,535
Speaker 2:  is trying to do. And I think in a sense of like, open

758
00:51:24,855 --> 00:51:27,015
Speaker 2:  standards are better and we're trying to help everybody understand that.

759
00:51:27,015 --> 00:51:30,255
Speaker 2:  Sure. I get that we're in sort of a rising Tide lifts all boats moment,

760
00:51:31,075 --> 00:51:34,615
Speaker 2:  but the idea that I have to build sort of

761
00:51:34,765 --> 00:51:37,775
Speaker 2:  brittle software on top of brittle software, on top of brittle software to

762
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:41,535
Speaker 2:  get all of this to work together. Yeah. Seems like not the answer anybody

763
00:51:41,835 --> 00:51:45,815
Speaker 2:  is looking for here. So like, and especially Threads is gonna continue

764
00:51:45,815 --> 00:51:49,615
Speaker 2:  to work, it seems, I find Threads personally less interesting than I used

765
00:51:49,615 --> 00:51:53,135
Speaker 2:  to, but it's, it's, it's a booming platform. Blue Sky

766
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:57,375
Speaker 2:  appears to have some real staying power in this space. Is it

767
00:51:57,495 --> 00:52:01,415
Speaker 2:  a long-term problem for you as somebody who A, cares

768
00:52:01,415 --> 00:52:05,255
Speaker 2:  about the space but b believes in Activity Pub in particular, that Blue Sky

769
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,535
Speaker 2:  is not directly in that world?

770
00:52:08,285 --> 00:52:12,135
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I will like, I'll be straight on this one. I I

771
00:52:12,135 --> 00:52:15,655
Speaker 10:  don't wanna be like too Pollyannish, but

772
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:20,415
Speaker 10:  you know, they don't maintain the bridge. The bridge

773
00:52:20,475 --> 00:52:24,335
Speaker 10:  is maintained by a nonprofit called a New Social who are

774
00:52:24,585 --> 00:52:28,375
Speaker 10:  great guys, Ryan Barrett and New Jet and they're

775
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:32,215
Speaker 10:  doing really great work, but they aren't supported by Blue Sky.

776
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:36,175
Speaker 10:  Right. And the Blue Sky Corporation is really focused on

777
00:52:36,175 --> 00:52:39,455
Speaker 10:  their own network. They're not spending a lot of time engaging with the

778
00:52:39,455 --> 00:52:43,255
Speaker 10:  rest of The fediverse. And that's okay. So I find it

779
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:47,495
Speaker 10:  frustrating that Blue Sky exists, that there is an at proto

780
00:52:47,605 --> 00:52:51,215
Speaker 10:  that it is kind of set up as a competitor to Activity Pub,

781
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:55,775
Speaker 10:  but in a lot of ways it's not a direct competitor. If I was

782
00:52:55,775 --> 00:52:59,535
Speaker 10:  gonna say how I understand at Proto, it's really

783
00:52:59,735 --> 00:53:03,695
Speaker 10:  a way to do say a Facebook platform

784
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:07,815
Speaker 10:  or a Twitter platform on a distributed

785
00:53:08,545 --> 00:53:11,975
Speaker 10:  blockchain like storage system. Hmm. Okay. So If you, you're familiar with

786
00:53:11,975 --> 00:53:15,735
Speaker 10:  like IPFS or some of the

787
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:17,175
Speaker 10:  peer-to-peer networks, right?

788
00:53:18,715 --> 00:53:21,735
Speaker 10:  Unlike Activity Pub, which has this like

789
00:53:22,205 --> 00:53:25,135
Speaker 10:  connections between different

790
00:53:25,715 --> 00:53:29,605
Speaker 10:  independent services that have their own internal storage, they

791
00:53:29,605 --> 00:53:33,085
Speaker 10:  do their own, you know, structures, UIs, et cetera.

792
00:53:33,555 --> 00:53:37,445
Speaker 10:  Blue Sky is really about having this kind of one big network and then

793
00:53:37,445 --> 00:53:41,405
Speaker 10:  you can build clients or filtering, et cetera that works

794
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:45,325
Speaker 10:  on it. So all of which is to say like, I don't

795
00:53:45,465 --> 00:53:49,245
Speaker 10:  see a Tumblr moving to use

796
00:53:49,985 --> 00:53:53,965
Speaker 10:  at Proto and Blue Sky, right? Sure. Tumblr is an existing

797
00:53:53,965 --> 00:53:57,925
Speaker 10:  network that has a hundred million people on it and they

798
00:53:57,945 --> 00:54:01,605
Speaker 10:  are working to implement Activity Pub because that gives them

799
00:54:01,965 --> 00:54:05,925
Speaker 10:  a chance to connect to the rush of this fediverse and

800
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:09,805
Speaker 10:  still maintain their independence. Kind of Tumblr

801
00:54:09,805 --> 00:54:12,965
Speaker 10:  works its own way, right? Yeah. And they've got that kind of maintenance.

802
00:54:13,195 --> 00:54:16,925
Speaker 10:  Does that make sense? I I think that Blue Sky like has

803
00:54:17,075 --> 00:54:20,765
Speaker 10:  some opportunities to pick up like third party developers. There

804
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:24,885
Speaker 10:  are some interesting apps that are built being built on top of that network

805
00:54:25,145 --> 00:54:29,045
Speaker 10:  and don't want to like undercut that entirely. But at

806
00:54:29,045 --> 00:54:32,245
Speaker 10:  the same time, I don't think it represents the same kind of

807
00:54:33,015 --> 00:54:36,725
Speaker 10:  networking between independent platforms that Activity

808
00:54:36,865 --> 00:54:37,245
Speaker 10:  Pup does.

809
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:41,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That, that idea of the not needing to

810
00:54:41,765 --> 00:54:45,605
Speaker 2:  build a social graph just to build an app, I think is incredibly exciting.

811
00:54:45,605 --> 00:54:47,925
Speaker 2:  And it's the thing I hear from app developers all the time that I'm like,

812
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:51,045
Speaker 2:  I, they're like, I don't even have to build a login system. You just, you

813
00:54:51,045 --> 00:54:53,085
Speaker 2:  just come with your Mastodon account and all your friends are already here

814
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:56,245
Speaker 2:  like that. There's something really powerful in that. What I, I assume you're

815
00:54:56,385 --> 00:54:59,325
Speaker 2:  one of the people running around to companies like

816
00:54:59,915 --> 00:55:03,765
Speaker 2:  YouTube and Facebook and, and others trying to

817
00:55:03,865 --> 00:55:07,845
Speaker 2:  get the big platforms to understand the value of this. And

818
00:55:07,845 --> 00:55:11,685
Speaker 2:  I think the, the part of me that is less optimistic about the

819
00:55:11,715 --> 00:55:14,245
Speaker 2:  sort of universal takeover of The Fediverse, which I would love to be the

820
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:18,005
Speaker 2:  case, thinks that there's really no compelling reason

821
00:55:18,385 --> 00:55:22,245
Speaker 2:  for any of these sort of sufficiently large networks to

822
00:55:22,305 --> 00:55:26,045
Speaker 2:  be part of this. Yeah. How, how do you feel like it's going with the,

823
00:55:26,145 --> 00:55:29,005
Speaker 2:  the, you know, the YouTubes and LinkedIns and Facebooks of the world?

824
00:55:29,475 --> 00:55:33,245
Speaker 10:  Well, like I can say that like we've had some

825
00:55:33,425 --> 00:55:37,165
Speaker 10:  really great, you know, opportunities that are coming up.

826
00:55:37,165 --> 00:55:40,925
Speaker 10:  They're still like kind of working, working forward. I think

827
00:55:41,025 --> 00:55:44,365
Speaker 10:  the thing for say a Google right who are

828
00:55:44,715 --> 00:55:48,485
Speaker 10:  notoriously skeptical about engaging with social

829
00:55:48,485 --> 00:55:51,125
Speaker 10:  networks, right? They, they took like they've been

830
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:51,965
Speaker 2:  Burned a few times.

831
00:55:52,765 --> 00:55:56,125
Speaker 10:  Yeah. They've been burned so much and they're like never again. Right? Yeah.

832
00:55:56,145 --> 00:56:00,005
Speaker 10:  No more social. Even though they run one of the biggest social platforms,

833
00:56:00,005 --> 00:56:03,245
Speaker 10:  YouTube in the world, they, they really kind of think of themselves as like

834
00:56:03,345 --> 00:56:07,325
Speaker 10:  out of social and being able

835
00:56:07,345 --> 00:56:11,205
Speaker 10:  to say like, you can have a product in the social space that doesn't

836
00:56:11,525 --> 00:56:15,205
Speaker 10:  have to be a monopoly, doesn't have to own the whole

837
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:19,125
Speaker 10:  system. Right. Another company that's like famous for

838
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:23,045
Speaker 10:  this is Apple who I've made like a few tentative efforts in the

839
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:27,045
Speaker 10:  social space and kind of again got burnt. Apple is

840
00:56:27,045 --> 00:56:30,685
Speaker 10:  great at, you know, deploying cloud services and iCloud

841
00:56:31,075 --> 00:56:34,965
Speaker 10:  providing great interfaces that are easy for people to use and

842
00:56:35,035 --> 00:56:38,765
Speaker 10:  like owning the devices and end user

843
00:56:38,765 --> 00:56:42,605
Speaker 10:  operating systems where they can be incorporated. So like that is

844
00:56:42,605 --> 00:56:46,205
Speaker 10:  an opportunity, The Fediverse is an opportunity for Apple to get involved

845
00:56:46,205 --> 00:56:50,005
Speaker 10:  in social networks without necessarily having to be like the one and only

846
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:51,685
Speaker 10:  social network in the world. Right, right.

847
00:56:51,865 --> 00:56:54,925
Speaker 2:  Or trying to build Facebook from scratch, which turns out to be pretty hard

848
00:56:54,925 --> 00:56:55,765
Speaker 2:  to do. Yeah.

849
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:59,925
Speaker 10:  Yeah. You don't have to build for like 1.2 billion people.

850
00:57:00,345 --> 00:57:04,205
Speaker 10:  You can build for like one person and they can engage with

851
00:57:04,205 --> 00:57:07,805
Speaker 10:  all those billions of people, you know, across The fediverse and that's

852
00:57:07,805 --> 00:57:10,965
Speaker 10:  the really great part. You can start having value really early on.

853
00:57:11,435 --> 00:57:15,165
Speaker 2:  Totally. How, what are you hearing in the, in the startup world? I feel like

854
00:57:15,395 --> 00:57:19,085
Speaker 2:  I've been waiting for a while for there to be

855
00:57:19,635 --> 00:57:23,405
Speaker 2:  kind of the, the thing that turns everybody on to The

856
00:57:23,405 --> 00:57:26,325
Speaker 2:  fediverse and it was like it was gonna be mastered on and it was gonna be

857
00:57:26,325 --> 00:57:29,805
Speaker 2:  Threads and I think it still might be Threads, but Threads is going kind

858
00:57:29,805 --> 00:57:33,525
Speaker 2:  of slowly and I don't wanna say haphazardly, but

859
00:57:33,655 --> 00:57:37,605
Speaker 2:  let's just say slowly and I was gonna say, but I think

860
00:57:37,605 --> 00:57:41,245
Speaker 2:  the lesson of Blue Sky is that actually there's something about the simplicity

861
00:57:41,245 --> 00:57:44,445
Speaker 2:  of that that has been really productive for Blue Sky, right? Yeah. Like it

862
00:57:44,445 --> 00:57:48,405
Speaker 2:  blue sky explains itself much, much faster than Sure The Fediverse does

863
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:52,205
Speaker 2:  in a way that I think has been really helpful for Blue Sky. Like yeah, maybe,

864
00:57:52,215 --> 00:57:55,805
Speaker 2:  maybe in the course of time that becomes a limiting factor,

865
00:57:56,025 --> 00:57:59,045
Speaker 2:  but it's also like you, you could just sign up and type in a username and

866
00:57:59,045 --> 00:58:02,965
Speaker 2:  start using Blue Sky in a way that I think in, that's

867
00:58:02,965 --> 00:58:06,005
Speaker 2:  the reason to me to have a killer app in the first place is just to like,

868
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:10,205
Speaker 2:  just to have the thing that gets you in the door Yeah. Goes a long way. Yeah.

869
00:58:10,205 --> 00:58:13,125
Speaker 2:  And I don't, maybe that doesn't matter in 20 years, but as somebody who would

870
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:16,405
Speaker 2:  love everybody to just like start using it right now, I feel like I want

871
00:58:16,405 --> 00:58:16,965
Speaker 2:  that to exist.

872
00:58:17,315 --> 00:58:20,125
Speaker 10:  Yeah, no, absolutely. And I think that's one of the things that Blue Sky

873
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:23,765
Speaker 10:  has done so well, like If you are a Twitter refugee, right?

874
00:58:23,905 --> 00:58:27,205
Speaker 10:  And you're, you're washing up on the Blue Sky shores, like

875
00:58:27,785 --> 00:58:31,085
Speaker 10:  it looks very familiar, you know, what you're doing, you know,

876
00:58:31,395 --> 00:58:35,005
Speaker 10:  limitations like on the number of characters or things like that.

877
00:58:35,115 --> 00:58:38,365
Speaker 10:  Sure. Like, yeah, I I love this, this is just what I know from Twitter.

878
00:58:38,365 --> 00:58:42,125
Speaker 10:  Right. But you know, I think that If you are a startup

879
00:58:42,665 --> 00:58:46,525
Speaker 10:  who is working on making, you know, the next four square or

880
00:58:46,525 --> 00:58:49,805
Speaker 10:  the next Tinder, right. Whatever it is,

881
00:58:50,425 --> 00:58:54,365
Speaker 10:  and you wanna build on top of a, a network where you already

882
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:58,245
Speaker 10:  know that there are millions of people already participating, I think it's

883
00:58:58,245 --> 00:59:02,205
Speaker 10:  harder to build that on top of an at proto than it is on top of

884
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,685
Speaker 10:  an activity pub. Right. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. There's, there's

885
00:59:04,685 --> 00:59:08,085
Speaker 10:  just more room to like innovate and build interesting things.

886
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:12,285
Speaker 2:  How are the business conversations going on, on all sides of this? Because

887
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:16,125
Speaker 2:  one of the things, I mean you talk about the interesting feelings of people

888
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:20,085
Speaker 2:  on Mastodon is that anytime you talk about money on

889
00:59:20,085 --> 00:59:23,885
Speaker 2:  The Fediverse, people get squirrely. Yeah. And I think, I think

890
00:59:23,885 --> 00:59:27,365
Speaker 2:  it's because there is something that feels pure about

891
00:59:27,835 --> 00:59:31,605
Speaker 2:  this thing that is being built. And people have seen us go through that

892
00:59:31,605 --> 00:59:34,245
Speaker 2:  before and then it became corrupted by money and they're desperate for it

893
00:59:34,245 --> 00:59:36,605
Speaker 2:  not to be corrupted by money, but at some point for this thing to work, there

894
00:59:36,605 --> 00:59:40,565
Speaker 2:  has to be money in it. And, and I think to some

895
00:59:40,565 --> 00:59:43,645
Speaker 2:  extent there are, there are obvious ways people make money, right? Like you,

896
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:47,365
Speaker 2:  you can do lots of things on top of these services, you sell ads, like whatever.

897
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:51,365
Speaker 2:  But the, to me the the biggest challenge is just going to be the

898
00:59:51,735 --> 00:59:55,245
Speaker 2:  convincing everybody involved that there is a business inside of this and

899
00:59:55,245 --> 00:59:58,845
Speaker 2:  that that's okay. Strikes me is maybe one of the hardest parts

900
00:59:59,145 --> 01:00:01,125
Speaker 2:  of sort of evangelizing this whole space.

901
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:05,745
Speaker 10:  You know, I mean when we talk about like

902
01:00:06,065 --> 01:00:08,745
Speaker 10:  business models for social content, right?

903
01:00:09,945 --> 01:00:13,425
Speaker 10:  I think we have some pretty decent ones that have, you know,

904
01:00:13,775 --> 01:00:17,625
Speaker 10:  been proven through the test of time, right? Ad supported

905
01:00:18,685 --> 01:00:22,505
Speaker 10:  and algorithmic feeds is like a great example that pretty

906
01:00:22,505 --> 01:00:26,225
Speaker 10:  much whatever half of tech runs off of, right? It

907
01:00:26,225 --> 01:00:29,545
Speaker 10:  depending on ad supported feeds.

908
01:00:30,425 --> 01:00:34,345
Speaker 10:  I think another one that has been super positive for creators,

909
01:00:34,925 --> 01:00:38,465
Speaker 10:  for creative people has been subscription based

910
01:00:39,025 --> 01:00:42,825
Speaker 10:  business. So, you know, whether you're a Twitch broadcaster or

911
01:00:42,985 --> 01:00:46,625
Speaker 10:  a Substack publisher, you get to

912
01:00:46,735 --> 01:00:50,265
Speaker 10:  like establish these subscriptions and you're kind of maintaining a more

913
01:00:50,265 --> 01:00:53,265
Speaker 10:  direct relationship with your audience and develop and

914
01:00:54,195 --> 01:00:58,145
Speaker 10:  delivering premium content to them based on, you know,

915
01:00:58,145 --> 01:01:01,785
Speaker 10:  that direct relationship. And both of those are

916
01:01:01,885 --> 01:01:05,705
Speaker 10:  really awesome. You know, there are other business models that work,

917
01:01:06,045 --> 01:01:10,025
Speaker 10:  but you know, I think that those are two that seem to work pretty well

918
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:13,425
Speaker 10:  for different players in this, in the social space.

919
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:18,065
Speaker 10:  I think the question that comes up and that's been really

920
01:01:18,335 --> 01:01:22,265
Speaker 10:  hard for people who are engaged in The fediverse

921
01:01:22,285 --> 01:01:25,425
Speaker 10:  to deal with is, and I'm gonna be like

922
01:01:27,005 --> 01:01:30,625
Speaker 10:  biting the hand of some of the big networks that have, that have

923
01:01:30,905 --> 01:01:34,505
Speaker 10:  supported us so far. But you know, when Twitter

924
01:01:34,755 --> 01:01:37,905
Speaker 10:  moved to an advertising based model, they

925
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:42,345
Speaker 10:  really clamped down on access to their API Right. And your

926
01:01:42,345 --> 01:01:46,065
Speaker 10:  ability to say resort the feed or filter

927
01:01:46,525 --> 01:01:49,785
Speaker 10:  or take parts out of the feed because

928
01:01:50,145 --> 01:01:53,105
Speaker 2:  Suddenly it's their business to have you on twitter.com. Like it's exactly,

929
01:01:53,105 --> 01:01:54,105
Speaker 2:  that's how it happens. Yeah,

930
01:01:54,135 --> 01:01:57,545
Speaker 10:  Exactly. They only want you to see things in a certain way, in a certain

931
01:01:58,325 --> 01:02:02,185
Speaker 10:  way of addressing it. Same with Facebook, right? So they

932
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,905
Speaker 10:  very much cut back on the ability of third party clients to

933
01:02:07,105 --> 01:02:11,025
Speaker 10:  interact with the Facebook data because they needed to

934
01:02:11,265 --> 01:02:14,745
Speaker 10:  maintain a very specific, you know, way of

935
01:02:14,745 --> 01:02:17,905
Speaker 10:  delivering ads to the, to the user. And I think that

936
01:02:18,495 --> 01:02:22,125
Speaker 10:  it's a lot harder to do in The fediverse structure where,

937
01:02:22,385 --> 01:02:26,245
Speaker 10:  you know, I'm on Tumblr and you're on Threads, and Threads

938
01:02:26,245 --> 01:02:30,005
Speaker 10:  pushes an ad into that network and Tumblr throws it

939
01:02:30,005 --> 01:02:33,485
Speaker 10:  away, right? Like right, or or my client throws it away because I don't

940
01:02:33,485 --> 01:02:37,445
Speaker 10:  want to see it. You don't have that same control in this kind of network.

941
01:02:38,105 --> 01:02:41,925
Speaker 10:  So there are other ways to deliver ads, but that idea that like

942
01:02:42,505 --> 01:02:46,405
Speaker 10:  one company is going to control from one end to the other, how

943
01:02:46,405 --> 01:02:49,765
Speaker 10:  the stream of content is delivered and make sure that ads are included,

944
01:02:50,315 --> 01:02:53,725
Speaker 10:  that breaks down in The fediverse. And I think that that means like

945
01:02:55,385 --> 01:02:59,265
Speaker 10:  a, it's a little bit, you know, tough for companies that have

946
01:02:59,785 --> 01:03:03,105
Speaker 10:  depended on that business model so far, but b

947
01:03:03,815 --> 01:03:07,625
Speaker 10:  there's a lot of great opportunities to build new kinds of

948
01:03:07,685 --> 01:03:11,625
Speaker 10:  ad networks in that space. Right, right. If, If you want to, like

949
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:15,425
Speaker 10:  that is something that can happen. And, and I think that,

950
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:19,265
Speaker 10:  you know, I think that there's some real interesting opportunities there.

951
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:23,145
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean it's, it's very funny, the, the like user

952
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:27,305
Speaker 2:  in me looks at that and is like, well, tough noogies everybody

953
01:03:27,365 --> 01:03:30,905
Speaker 2:  now you have to compete on building great products, not on locking me into

954
01:03:30,905 --> 01:03:34,745
Speaker 2:  your social network. Yeah. Oh no, how awful. But then

955
01:03:34,745 --> 01:03:38,505
Speaker 2:  the part of me that is like, okay, these companies are full of business people

956
01:03:38,505 --> 01:03:42,065
Speaker 2:  making business decisions, worry is that they just won't try because they

957
01:03:42,065 --> 01:03:45,985
Speaker 2:  know it might lead that way. Right. And they'll have

958
01:03:45,985 --> 01:03:49,945
Speaker 2:  to like actually compete and try hard and do good work forever in order

959
01:03:49,945 --> 01:03:53,745
Speaker 2:  to keep winning. And boy, I hope they all sign up to do

960
01:04:22,105 --> 01:04:24,305
Speaker 10:  like, why would you have any

961
01:08:41,115 --> 01:08:44,535
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's get into The Vergecast hotline. As always, you

962
01:08:44,535 --> 01:08:48,455
Speaker 2:  can call 8 6 6 VERGE one one. You can email Vergecast at The Verge dot com.

963
01:08:48,755 --> 01:08:52,535
Speaker 2:  We love all of your questions. It is truly the best thing hearing

964
01:08:52,645 --> 01:08:55,895
Speaker 2:  from everybody. We get an email and a Slack notification every time somebody

965
01:08:56,185 --> 01:09:00,135
Speaker 2:  calls in. It's the best. Cannot recommend highly enough having a bunch

966
01:09:00,135 --> 01:09:03,895
Speaker 2:  of strangers call and ask you tech questions. Anyway, this week instead of

967
01:09:04,095 --> 01:09:07,575
Speaker 2:  questions I want to play you some feedback that we got. We talked a bunch

968
01:09:07,575 --> 01:09:11,455
Speaker 2:  about the iPhone 16 E last week and in particular I

969
01:09:11,475 --> 01:09:14,655
Speaker 2:  had some strong feelings about the price of the thing. I think

970
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:19,255
Speaker 2:  a $600 phone and an $800 phone are not

971
01:09:19,495 --> 01:09:23,015
Speaker 2:  actually that different in a meaningful way when you think of how people

972
01:09:23,415 --> 01:09:26,775
Speaker 2:  actually buy and use smartphones. But we got a bunch of feedback from people

973
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:30,295
Speaker 2:  saying maybe I'm wrong about that. So let me just play you

974
01:09:30,595 --> 01:09:34,535
Speaker 2:  one voicemail that we got and then we're gonna get into it.

975
01:09:36,235 --> 01:09:40,095
Speaker 19:  Hi, this is Gau from India. I've been listening

976
01:09:40,095 --> 01:09:44,055
Speaker 19:  to the podcast about the iPhone 16 E and I think you guys

977
01:09:44,165 --> 01:09:47,975
Speaker 19:  have just totally missed why Apple

978
01:09:48,245 --> 01:09:52,175
Speaker 19:  made the iPhone 16 P and it's definitely not

979
01:09:52,475 --> 01:09:56,255
Speaker 19:  for the US market, it's definitely for the Indian

980
01:09:56,255 --> 01:09:59,935
Speaker 19:  market. They have been trying to penetrate into India for

981
01:10:00,155 --> 01:10:03,935
Speaker 19:  so long and this is the device, I

982
01:10:03,935 --> 01:10:07,375
Speaker 19:  think they will be doing it away because

983
01:10:07,965 --> 01:10:11,495
Speaker 19:  usually the selling price, the best selling

984
01:10:11,635 --> 01:10:14,975
Speaker 19:  iPhone at sale time is usually

985
01:10:15,555 --> 01:10:19,295
Speaker 19:  the older iPhones, which is like iPhone 13 or iPhone

986
01:10:19,775 --> 01:10:23,295
Speaker 19:  14, which is like two, three years ago.

987
01:10:24,155 --> 01:10:27,775
Speaker 19:  Old iPhones, so which sell for

988
01:10:28,035 --> 01:10:31,335
Speaker 19:  around 60,000 to 70,000

989
01:10:32,275 --> 01:10:36,015
Speaker 19:  rupees in India this time they're releasing

990
01:10:36,415 --> 01:10:40,335
Speaker 19:  a new iPhone, which you can buy brand new, which

991
01:10:40,335 --> 01:10:43,975
Speaker 19:  is for iPhone 16 E for

992
01:10:43,975 --> 01:10:47,855
Speaker 19:  60,000 rupees. So imagine the sales

993
01:10:47,855 --> 01:10:51,295
Speaker 19:  numbers that's gonna bring for you and when

994
01:10:51,685 --> 01:10:55,495
Speaker 19:  there's a sale on the iPhone 16 E, it's

995
01:10:55,495 --> 01:10:59,295
Speaker 19:  gonna come down even more. It's gonna, it's gonna sell

996
01:10:59,295 --> 01:11:00,895
Speaker 19:  like hot gigs in India.

997
01:11:02,465 --> 01:11:06,095
Speaker 19:  Apple usually have a brand value in India,

998
01:11:06,185 --> 01:11:09,815
Speaker 19:  which a lot of other manufacturers don't have.

999
01:11:10,555 --> 01:11:14,365
Speaker 19:  So everybody wants to buy an iPhone and bringing the

1000
01:11:14,365 --> 01:11:18,125
Speaker 19:  price down is like the best move they can do and

1001
01:11:18,305 --> 01:11:21,725
Speaker 19:  I'm telling you right now it'll be the best selling iPhone model

1002
01:11:22,225 --> 01:11:25,525
Speaker 19:  of the year hands down in India.

1003
01:11:26,635 --> 01:11:29,885
Speaker 2:  This actually makes quite a lot of sense to me. I think I probably underrated

1004
01:11:29,905 --> 01:11:33,645
Speaker 2:  the extent to which people around the world, especially

1005
01:11:33,995 --> 01:11:37,445
Speaker 2:  outside of the US where most of the cell phone market is much less

1006
01:11:37,795 --> 01:11:41,605
Speaker 2:  carrier dominated and postpaid and based on

1007
01:11:41,605 --> 01:11:45,005
Speaker 2:  like multi-year contracts that you have with your carrier, a lot of people

1008
01:11:45,005 --> 01:11:48,045
Speaker 2:  just buy a phone in a store and put a SIM card in and walk away. And in that

1009
01:11:48,155 --> 01:11:51,845
Speaker 2:  case, a $200 difference is super meaningful and

1010
01:11:51,845 --> 01:11:55,645
Speaker 2:  obviously in many parts of the world the price difference can even

1011
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:59,525
Speaker 2:  be bigger or feel bigger. So I I, I think that's right. I buy that

1012
01:11:59,665 --> 01:12:03,405
Speaker 2:  and we heard this from a bunch of people. Actually I got an email from Mauricio

1013
01:12:03,425 --> 01:12:07,085
Speaker 2:  in Brazil who said that here in Brazil, I can't think of one single person

1014
01:12:07,225 --> 01:12:10,485
Speaker 2:  who chooses a phone based on carrier deals. I really don't know anyone who

1015
01:12:10,485 --> 01:12:13,725
Speaker 2:  buys this way considering that Apple sells to many other countries, it feels

1016
01:12:13,725 --> 01:12:17,205
Speaker 2:  like you missed an important part of the conversation. Totally fair. I still

1017
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:21,125
Speaker 2:  think the logic of why would you make it this cost and not

1018
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:24,885
Speaker 2:  the cost of the s se is complicated, right? I think if Apple had found a

1019
01:12:24,885 --> 01:12:28,285
Speaker 2:  way to even split the difference, make this thing 4 99 instead of

1020
01:12:28,285 --> 01:12:31,925
Speaker 2:  5 99, I think that price Delta becomes really

1021
01:12:32,445 --> 01:12:36,365
Speaker 2:  powerful. But Apple has always been happy selling to a smaller

1022
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:40,165
Speaker 2:  but more affluent group of phone buyers. I think maybe the thing that I'm

1023
01:12:40,445 --> 01:12:44,405
Speaker 2:  reacting to above all else is that this is just such an unlike Apple move.

1024
01:12:45,065 --> 01:12:48,725
Speaker 2:  If the thing that Apple is doing here is purely about

1025
01:12:48,735 --> 01:12:52,045
Speaker 2:  price and it seems like it's purely about price, but then again this is the

1026
01:12:52,045 --> 01:12:55,965
Speaker 2:  company that's also selling an M1 MacBook Air in Walmart now. So maybe

1027
01:12:55,965 --> 01:12:59,845
Speaker 2:  Apple just is a price conscious company in a way that it never

1028
01:12:59,845 --> 01:13:03,685
Speaker 2:  really has been before and would still like you to not think that it's,

1029
01:13:04,185 --> 01:13:08,165
Speaker 2:  we also got an email from Marcine who said, I found some data from 2022 that

1030
01:13:08,165 --> 01:13:12,085
Speaker 2:  shows that 44% of the cellular user population in the US is on prepaid

1031
01:13:12,085 --> 01:13:15,485
Speaker 2:  plans. I haven't checked that number, but if it's true, that's a higher number

1032
01:13:15,485 --> 01:13:19,025
Speaker 2:  than I would've expected. I'm guessing that this group is probably more cost

1033
01:13:19,025 --> 01:13:22,265
Speaker 2:  conscious and price sensitive, and for them the iPhone 16 E makes a lot more

1034
01:13:22,265 --> 01:13:25,625
Speaker 2:  sense. Also, I wanna point out that the price difference between 16 e and

1035
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:29,545
Speaker 2:  16 isn't 200, but more like two 50. He's talking about things like

1036
01:13:29,545 --> 01:13:33,185
Speaker 2:  adding in taxes and taking away some of the carrier deals that you get to

1037
01:13:33,185 --> 01:13:37,145
Speaker 2:  make these things cheaper Again, all true and I think the idea

1038
01:13:37,255 --> 01:13:41,105
Speaker 2:  that people are walking into a store, putting down a credit card or

1039
01:13:41,305 --> 01:13:45,265
Speaker 2:  cash and buying a phone outright is certainly true. I think

1040
01:13:45,535 --> 01:13:49,265
Speaker 2:  that just hasn't really been Apple's clientele for

1041
01:13:49,295 --> 01:13:53,265
Speaker 2:  many, many years now, that is not the group of people that Apple has

1042
01:13:53,265 --> 01:13:56,785
Speaker 2:  typically served. Apple is typically interested in really high margins on

1043
01:13:56,785 --> 01:14:00,665
Speaker 2:  really high prices for people who are much less price conscious. And

1044
01:14:00,665 --> 01:14:04,585
Speaker 2:  so maybe what I need to do is just reframe my brain a little bit

1045
01:14:04,585 --> 01:14:08,145
Speaker 2:  to think of Apple as a company interested in hitting all price points for

1046
01:14:08,145 --> 01:14:11,715
Speaker 2:  the sake of hitting all price points. It it makes perfect sense as a business

1047
01:14:11,715 --> 01:14:15,515
Speaker 2:  move. If you're Apple and you're increasingly a services business and actually

1048
01:14:15,515 --> 01:14:18,515
Speaker 2:  what you want is to have your stuff in more people's hands, that's what Google

1049
01:14:18,575 --> 01:14:22,395
Speaker 2:  has been doing forever, right? Google makes the majority of its money, not

1050
01:14:22,395 --> 01:14:25,315
Speaker 2:  when you buy an Android phone, but when you use the services on an Android

1051
01:14:25,315 --> 01:14:29,275
Speaker 2:  phone. So Google has a huge incentive to put its phones in

1052
01:14:29,275 --> 01:14:32,795
Speaker 2:  front of as many people as possible across price spectrums, across

1053
01:14:32,795 --> 01:14:36,635
Speaker 2:  demographics. It's just a volume game for Google and if Apple

1054
01:14:36,695 --> 01:14:40,155
Speaker 2:  is a services company, it's playing the same kind of volume game. So maybe

1055
01:14:40,155 --> 01:14:44,075
Speaker 2:  that just is Apple now. Anyway, thank you to everybody who called

1056
01:14:44,075 --> 01:14:47,755
Speaker 2:  in and emailed with feedback. These are good points and I think

1057
01:14:47,895 --> 01:14:51,515
Speaker 2:  the the price of an iPhone is more interesting and more

1058
01:14:51,785 --> 01:14:53,875
Speaker 2:  complicated maybe than I even realized.

1059
01:14:55,695 --> 01:14:59,075
Speaker 2:  Anyway, that is it for the show today. Thank you to everybody who came on
