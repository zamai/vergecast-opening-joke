32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,360
Speaker 7:  96 hours? I just find it deeply hilarious. And I'd like you to tell everybody

33
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,200
Speaker 5:  One thing I don't recommend is being at lax three times in three days.

34
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,120
Speaker 5:  No, I was like, ah, I just live at lax. Now. This is where I'm at. I know

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,000
Speaker 5:  all the people I like said load the concession stand version. It

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,680
Speaker 5:  was great. So I have had five flights in seven days, basically. Oof.

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,440
Speaker 5:  So I flew home to do a panel with the Mount

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,360
Speaker 5:  pleasant community group, a better Mount pleasant about Foxcon. That was

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,280
Speaker 5:  really fun. It was great to be home. My dad was there. Nerve-wracking then

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,080
Speaker 5:  I flew to LA for the first day of the code conference. Then I went

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,000
Speaker 5:  to San Francisco for apple. Then I flew back to LA the next day.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,960
Speaker 5:  And then a day later I flew home. So it's just been a ride. I was

43
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,320
Speaker 5:  at the point where I left some clothes in a hotel room because I knew I was

44
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,720
Speaker 5:  gonna come back to the hotel room and I was like, I just live here. Now

45
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,160
Speaker 7:  You had two simultaneous hotel rooms in two different

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,040
Speaker 5:  Cities. S that's. I was like, I don't even

47
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,680
Speaker 5:  know what's going on in my life, but it's great. The joke I made to David

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,640
Speaker 5:  was like, I think people think that's what my job is always like, so I

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,520
Speaker 5:  can't complain too much to be like, I'm chasing Tim cook around the state

50
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,280
Speaker 5:  of California. Like it was great. It was fun. It was exciting. Code

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,120
Speaker 5:  was great. The apple event was fun. We're gonna talk about all of those things.

52
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,880
Speaker 5:  Really. This is gonna be an apple themed version,

53
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,880
Speaker 5:  cuz it many things happened with apple this last week, iPhone

54
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,080
Speaker 5:  14 event, there was the new iPhone 14, which is really the iPhone 13

55
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,200
Speaker 5:  iPhone 14 plus the pro models pro max, lots of

56
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,600
Speaker 5:  camera stuff, apple watch series eight, apple watch ultra.

57
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,960
Speaker 5:  I mean there's there a lot going on new AirPods, near AirPods pro and then

58
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,400
Speaker 5:  that evening we all went on separate planes.

59
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,560
Speaker 5:  I will hasten to add to the co conference where Tim cook spoke on

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,080
Speaker 5:  a panel with Johnny ive and Lauren Powell jobs with the legacy of two jobs

61
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,480
Speaker 5:  with the care SU Fisher, which was incredible in many ways. So just a lot

62
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,520
Speaker 5:  going on in that day, but a ton of news just from the apple event, let's

63
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,840
Speaker 5:  start there. Do you wanna start with, we should start with the phones. So

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,440
Speaker 8:  Let's take a look at the new iPhone.

65
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,640
Speaker 7:  So the basic rundown is there's four phones. There's the iPhone 14,

66
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,320
Speaker 7:  which like you said is basically the iPhone 13. There's the iPhone 14 plus,

67
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,040
Speaker 7:  which is the exact same thing as the iPhone 14, but instead of a 6.1 inch

68
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,880
Speaker 7:  screen, it has a 6.7 inch screen. And then there's the iPhone pro and

69
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,680
Speaker 7:  Promax, which have all kinds of interesting stuff in them.

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,520
Speaker 5:  The dynamic island. Yes.

71
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,920
Speaker 9:  So now when you receive an alert, the dynamic island expands to

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,280
Speaker 9:  notify

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,280
Speaker 7:  You. So I tweeted yesterday on Thursday saying the Vergecast is

74
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,240
Speaker 7:  gonna be a little late. And also if you have any questions that you, if like

75
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,680
Speaker 7:  anything you want us to talk about on the Vergecast let me know. And solidly

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,240
Speaker 7:  half of the responses I got were basically to the tune of like, are we really

77
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,120
Speaker 7:  gonna let them get away with calling it the dynamic island? Like we're just

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,800
Speaker 7:  gonna do this.

79
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,440
Speaker 5:  So they they're already running the ads. I watched the bills Rams game last

80
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,520
Speaker 5:  night. And like every other ad was a dynamic island ad.

81
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,920
Speaker 6:  What, what would they call it though? But if they didn't call it that just

82
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,880
Speaker 6:  a toggle switch,

83
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,240
Speaker 7:  Anything else?

84
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,120
Speaker 5:  So I think the name is great. I've come around on the fact that like, if

85
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,480
Speaker 5:  you were a company, the size of apple, apple has been very

86
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,000
Speaker 5:  conservative recently, right? Like it's, I mean, it's a huge company,

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,760
Speaker 5:  global scale politics, regulators, data

88
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,040
Speaker 5:  centers, and like they're cons. They are now just because of who they are.

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,480
Speaker 5:  They're a conservative company, right? Every now and again, apple is the

90
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,760
Speaker 5:  only company of that scale. That's like dynamic island. Let's do it. I

91
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,640
Speaker 6:  Mean, there's like a history of really stupid names for really cool

92
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,560
Speaker 6:  user interfaces, right? Like there's the hamburger, there's the

93
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,360
Speaker 6:  meatballs

94
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,240
Speaker 5:  Straight up. We call it a mess. Everyone all day long is like, let me get

95
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,600
Speaker 5:  my mouse and wait, just let that slide. I don't know. The dynamic island

96
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,400
Speaker 5:  is gonna stay.

97
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,280
Speaker 6:  It'll just be island.

98
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Look, I think it's a fun name. They had to call it something. Do

99
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,760
Speaker 7:  You think there was a meeting at apple where somebody was like, what if we

100
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,920
Speaker 7:  call it the touch bar? That's basically what it is. Right? And then like

101
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,440
Speaker 7:  somebody from the Mac team just came sprinting into the room. It's like,

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,040
Speaker 7:  no, we can't do that. It's not allowed.

103
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,440
Speaker 5:  I think what will almost certainly end up happening is that diehard Mac fans

104
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,000
Speaker 5:  will call it the dynamic island. And then the billions upon billions of people

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,800
Speaker 5:  who buy the phone will like emergent behavior, some other name for it. And

106
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,520
Speaker 5:  that will be the name that everyone calls it. And then we'll be, our comments

107
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,840
Speaker 5:  will be full of pedantic arguments about actually calling it pedantic or

108
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,120
Speaker 5:  actually calling it the dynamic island or not trust me, like I live through

109
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,920
Speaker 5:  the OSX wars. Yeah. And like, it's gonna be bad. Yeah.

110
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,080
Speaker 5:  It's not gonna be great.

111
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,400
Speaker 7:  The technology of it is super cool though. It's super cool technology.

112
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,520
Speaker 5:  So that's where I'm like of both minds. Really. So the basic idea, right?

113
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,480
Speaker 5:  So they, they moved the notch down to a pill. It's the camera,

114
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,520
Speaker 5:  the true F sensor, the proximity sensor. They're actually two different spots.

115
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,960
Speaker 5:  So there's screening above them. So there's no more notch and there's screen

116
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,880
Speaker 5:  in between them and what the island does. Is it just like blacks out

117
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,680
Speaker 5:  more of that area to put indicators to the left and

118
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,560
Speaker 5:  right. Of the, of the pill shaped notches. Yeah. Yeah. Cutouts.

119
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,280
Speaker 5:  It's great. And so that part is interesting. Right? You're gonna take this

120
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,320
Speaker 5:  thing where the screen, where the screen is always blacked out and you're

121
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,520
Speaker 5:  actually gonna lean into it and black out more of the screen. Yeah. Cool.

122
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,320
Speaker 5:  Like very few companies will do that. Very few companies will tell their

123
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,240
Speaker 5:  developers to support such a thing and actually get their developers, do

124
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,920
Speaker 5:  it very apple in that way. You know, someone spent hours upon hours

125
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,280
Speaker 5:  doing the little bounce animations and they look great. But like

126
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,800
Speaker 5:  in use, David used it as well, too. The right. Really what you're getting

127
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,360
Speaker 5:  is like, when you place some music, you get music indicators. When you have

128
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,320
Speaker 5:  a timer going, you get timer indicators. The voice memo was one is really

129
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,160
Speaker 5:  cool. Like legitimately my favorite, one of the thing, cuz you get the little,

130
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,320
Speaker 5:  you get the little sound waves. Yeah. A love of sound waves. They showed

131
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,680
Speaker 5:  a bunch of other stuff, right? Lyft, like if you call a lift, it'll tell

132
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,960
Speaker 5:  you how long the lift will be. You get your sports scores, sports scores.

133
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,080
Speaker 5:  So they're all connected to the, the phone's widget system. So the

134
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,720
Speaker 5:  kind of like the way I have been thinking about this or these are like minimized

135
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,200
Speaker 5:  widgets.

136
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,800
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That's basically right. Are we

137
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Speaker 5:  Gonna call 'em widgets? The widget? Yeah. The widget notch

138
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,120
Speaker 5:  notch. Which

139
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,280
Speaker 7:  Notch? Which there it is. We got it in one. But wait, you,

140
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,200
Speaker 7:  you say that you say that like it's a bad thing. That feels like a good thing,

141
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,640
Speaker 5:  But it's like, how many widgets do you want to minimize? Yeah. And

142
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,640
Speaker 5:  I was, I've been making the list in my head and it's like actually vanishingly

143
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,360
Speaker 5:  few. Oh

144
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,920
Speaker 7:  That's interesting. I feel exactly the opposite. I really like, there are

145
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,240
Speaker 7:  so many things that my phone

146
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,680
Speaker 7:  knows that I wish it had quicker ways to tell me. Right. One of them

147
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,360
Speaker 7:  is like, is my alarm set? This is like a spoiler alert for the

148
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,440
Speaker 7:  iOS 16 review that I'm writing for next week. Is that like, there's

149
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,920
Speaker 7:  just a ton of things that apple used to require you. It's like, if I want

150
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Speaker 7:  to know if I, one easy example I always give is like, if you're a person

151
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,760
Speaker 7:  who uses like a habit tracker app and you open up the app every time you

152
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,120
Speaker 7:  wanna like log that you a glass of water. Right. That's too many steps.

153
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,400
Speaker 7:  And so for little things like that, or like who won the Yankee

154
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,320
Speaker 7:  game, like apple is like slowly pulling that out of apps and into like

155
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,280
Speaker 7:  the front of the phone and with iOS 16 on the lock screen, it's

156
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,880
Speaker 7:  pulling all that stuff even further to the front of the phone. And I feel

157
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,760
Speaker 7:  like the dynamic island is the kind of thing where it's just like, now it's

158
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,440
Speaker 7:  even more there. And for me there's like the question of, am I gonna wanna

159
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,160
Speaker 7:  see these things like 24 hours a day? I don't know.

160
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,120
Speaker 7:  And do I wanna see a tiny moving wave form all the time. I'm listening to

161
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,200
Speaker 7:  music. I also don't know, but there is a lot of like little tiny bits of

162
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,240
Speaker 7:  information that I'd like to have throughout the day that feel like they

163
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,920
Speaker 7:  fit there perfectly.

164
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,640
Speaker 6:  They're super contextual. Right? Cause like, I, I haven't gotten to play

165
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,280
Speaker 6:  with them. I've only seen like y'all's videos and the videos that apple

166
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,080
Speaker 6:  played, but they're contextual. So it's not like that waveform for the music

167
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,920
Speaker 6:  is always there. You still have to like interact to make it happen.

168
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,560
Speaker 5:  No. And there's a little bit of a delay. So if you open the music app and

169
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
Speaker 5:  stop the music and then go at the island is there and then it shrinks back

170
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,760
Speaker 5:  down to the notch

171
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,480
Speaker 6:  Like island get outta here. What are you doing?

172
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You can't. So like actually to David's point, like one of the things

173
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,800
Speaker 5:  that surprised me about it is it's the sort of like

174
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,800
Speaker 5:  user flow of it is more complicated than you would expect.

175
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,760
Speaker 5:  Yes. And I think in one particular way backwards, just having used, I

176
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,520
Speaker 5:  mean, we haven't gotten, we gotta like review the phone. Right. But so to,

177
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,320
Speaker 5:  to get it, you've gotta like open an app and do something. Right. You gotta

178
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,040
Speaker 5:  like start playing music. You gotta set a timer. Now you could do that from

179
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,760
Speaker 5:  like maybe a lock screen widget or something else or from Siri, but you gotta

180
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,520
Speaker 5:  like do something and like mostly you're gonna do it.

181
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,960
Speaker 5:  You're gonna open it up and do something. Yeah. Right. So then you close

182
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,440
Speaker 5:  the app and the thing flies into the widget. If you've got two things going

183
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,000
Speaker 5:  at once, there's a cool animation. The island breaks actually into two islands.

184
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,120
Speaker 5:  They haven't addressed that naming wise. It's

185
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,840
Speaker 7:  The archipelago.

186
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,840
Speaker 5:  That's great. So like you, but you gotta like do stuff. Right. And then

187
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,640
Speaker 5:  here's the thing. If you watch the ads, you watch the video, this is the

188
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,040
Speaker 5:  thing that really trip me up. You would think that if you tap on the island,

189
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,320
Speaker 5:  it opens the widget. Yes. Right? That is not the case. When you tap on it,

190
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,960
Speaker 5:  it opens the app. No. And when you, if you want the widget, you gotta

191
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,040
Speaker 5:  hold down. And that to me is totally backwards.

192
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,320
Speaker 7:  I've come around to your side of this. When you first mentioned that as we

193
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,760
Speaker 7:  were standing there at the hands on, like the second you touched it, that

194
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,720
Speaker 7:  was your instinct. And I didn't necessarily agree cuz like, as it

195
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,000
Speaker 7:  is with widgets, you hit, you tap the widget and it opens the app. So on

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,560
Speaker 7:  the one hand you would think that's expected behavior, but like it does,

197
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,320
Speaker 7:  it breaks the exact flow you're talking about. It should go like island to

198
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,760
Speaker 7:  widget, to app. And instead you have to like long press. I think, I think

199
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,480
Speaker 7:  you're totally right. And I bet apple changes

200
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,320
Speaker 5:  That. Yeah. It just seems, it seems totally backwards to

201
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,080
Speaker 6:  Me. Like when I press it, I expect it to have a quick contextual thing.

202
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,320
Speaker 6:  So I can do my thing without having to wait for the whole animation.

203
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Speaker 7:  Right. I wanna pause the music.

204
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,240
Speaker 5:  I would just say that if you have the functional equivalent of a right

205
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,120
Speaker 5:  click in your ads, you should rethink that. Right?

206
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,000
Speaker 5:  Like that's what a long press on a phone is. It's a right click. Yeah. Right.

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,760
Speaker 5:  And it's undiscoverable by most people like a year from now,

208
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,960
Speaker 5:  someone's gonna make a TikTok video. That's like top 10 feature of the iPhone

209
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,760
Speaker 5:  you didn't know about. And they're gonna be like, did you know? You could

210
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,000
Speaker 5:  long press and the camera to open more. And it's like, they're gonna get

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,760
Speaker 5:  a million views. That's ideas for free. Just start making that video now

212
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,120
Speaker 5:  TikTok

213
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,280
Speaker 7:  And run it in one year.

214
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Just like book it. Right. You wanna avoid burnout? You book your

215
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,720
Speaker 5:  content now. So like that's that flow is just

216
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,280
Speaker 5:  messy to me and I'm sure they'll tweak it. Or maybe they'll give you a switch.

217
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,400
Speaker 5:  Yeah. There's a million ways to solve. It's not like a deal breaker by any

218
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Speaker 5:  sense. But the earlier part of the flow where you gotta go do something to

219
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,200
Speaker 5:  get it. Like David, what you're talking about is like, there's a bunch of

220
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,800
Speaker 5:  apps on my phone where I just want them to kind of like flow data to me.

221
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Or like give me a control for the one thing. And control center does

222
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,080
Speaker 5:  that for some of those apps, doesn't do it for other apps, lock screen, widgets,

223
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,880
Speaker 5:  do it for some apps, not for other apps. And now you just have like 10 ways

224
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,280
Speaker 5:  to do that thing. Then it just, the island

225
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,280
Speaker 5:  creates another. But there's no like send this to the island,

226
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,120
Speaker 5:  but

227
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,400
Speaker 7:  That's true. There's no like step one island move. You can do you

228
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,840
Speaker 7:  have to like do the stuff and then leave

229
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,000
Speaker 6:  What would be a step one island? Because like, it makes sense to me that

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,640
Speaker 6:  I have to open the music app or the voice memo app. It looks like

231
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,200
Speaker 6:  the, the phone call one just pops up when you get a phone call.

232
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,840
Speaker 6:  And that makes sense. But like where are those cases? You want it to pop

233
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,320
Speaker 6:  up without

234
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,040
Speaker 5:  Interacting? Well, I think those are in apps. Like I'm not playing fantasy

235
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,560
Speaker 5:  football this year. I believe David is with our staff, which is gonna cause

236
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,080
Speaker 5:  a whole mutiny. But fantasy football happens on Sunday.

237
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,200
Speaker 5:  Like those apps should just start on Sunday afternoon and

238
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,040
Speaker 5:  populate the island and tell you how that's going. And like maybe that's

239
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,400
Speaker 5:  to come. I think that would be a great feature to build. And just right now,

240
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,600
Speaker 5:  like, you know, the, what the ad and the video promises you

241
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,240
Speaker 5:  is like this like constant animation of activity

242
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,560
Speaker 5:  and at least so far as we've used it, you gotta like do stuff

243
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,640
Speaker 7:  First. Yeah. Well, and there, there is like what, what you just described

244
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,560
Speaker 7:  is in an interesting way, like a low touch notification system,

245
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,360
Speaker 7:  which I could actually kind of get behind. It's like, what if your

246
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,240
Speaker 7:  dynamic island was like the ticker at the bottom of a news TV show?

247
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,400
Speaker 7:  Like, I don't know if that's a good idea or a terrible idea, but it's like,

248
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,440
Speaker 7:  there's a version of this that turns into something like that. And I think,

249
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,920
Speaker 7:  but

250
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,800
Speaker 6:  Isn't that a notification? Well,

251
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,320
Speaker 7:  That's what I mean. Right. But like, what if it didn't like buzz your phone

252
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,240
Speaker 7:  or come up over top of what you were already doing. It just sort of like

253
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,800
Speaker 7:  appears in there that it's like, what if it just says like touchdown and

254
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,280
Speaker 7:  then goes away? That's all I,

255
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah, there's just an, like we have to get it. We have to use it. We have

256
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,000
Speaker 5:  to feel it out. I'm basing this off of 45 frenzied minutes of hands on time

257
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,360
Speaker 5:  and a handful of conversations. But it's rare that there's any

258
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,560
Speaker 5:  distance between apple showing software and an ad and then what it is. And

259
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,760
Speaker 5:  here, there just felt like a lot of distance actually. Yeah. Cause they keep

260
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,600
Speaker 5:  showing you the expanded widget view in those ads. Yeah. And that you actually

261
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,520
Speaker 5:  have to know how to get those. Right. And like that to me is the first one

262
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,240
Speaker 5:  is like, if you're gonna show people that expanded view, it should be really

263
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,880
Speaker 5:  easy to get those because that's like the promise of the whole thing

264
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,200
Speaker 5:  is you, you kind of get these like that area, like minimized,

265
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,920
Speaker 5:  widgets, that area populates itself automatically with useful minimized

266
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,480
Speaker 5:  widgets that quickly get you to controls. But right now you tap on you just

267
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,400
Speaker 5:  like bomb into the app.

268
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,080
Speaker 6:  How excited were people at Steve do theater

269
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,040
Speaker 6:  about the dynamic island? Because I at home was very excited. That was the

270
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,520
Speaker 6:  thing people called me and were like, what phone should I get? And I was

271
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,160
Speaker 6:  like, get this one. Cause you get the dynamic island. And they're like, why,

272
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,280
Speaker 6:  why do I, what are you talking about, Alex? I'm hanging up now. Were people

273
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,640
Speaker 6:  excited?

274
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,160
Speaker 5:  I mean, there was a room full of like press people and YouTubers. Like of

275
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,640
Speaker 5:  course we are all excited. We're like, this is the thing we have to point

276
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:58,960
Speaker 5:  a camera.

277
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,600
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But I think it's like when you're in that room, everybody has the,

278
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,360
Speaker 6:  some feature that they're like, okay, I gotta go check out the camera. Or

279
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,760
Speaker 6:  like the year was slow motion camera. Everybody was like, oh,

280
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,160
Speaker 5:  So the, the fight here was the, the island and the apple watch ultra

281
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,600
Speaker 5:  and like the poor iPhone 14, the, the people

282
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,280
Speaker 5:  tasked with like showing off the iPhone 14 were like, would you wanna see

283
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,800
Speaker 5:  this one? So

284
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,600
Speaker 6:  13? And everyone's like, but with a new name

285
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,600
Speaker 5:  And they're like, this one, it comes in a slightly different color. And everyone's

286
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,920
Speaker 5:  like, I took one picture. I'm good. Like moving on. But

287
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,880
Speaker 7:  I do think there was something to actually like touching the thing

288
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,840
Speaker 7:  in a, in a funny way, cuz it's like, it makes for a great onscreen

289
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,960
Speaker 7:  demo cuz and, and like apple immediately got a bunch of credit from people

290
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,360
Speaker 7:  for like leaning into the notch. And I think it's like sort of

291
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,120
Speaker 7:  funny that apple is getting credit for that now because apple has always

292
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,400
Speaker 7:  done that. Like disagree when, when the notch first came out, apple made

293
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,320
Speaker 7:  all this noise to developers who were using the full

294
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,800
Speaker 7:  frame screen in their screenshots. And apple was like, absolutely not. The

295
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,760
Speaker 7:  notch has to be everywhere. Like normalized. The notch was like Apple's

296
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,160
Speaker 7:  thing for a long time. Apple

297
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,560
Speaker 6:  Was really bad about pushing like their own

298
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,600
Speaker 6:  software design was often scared of the notch. Right? Like, like,

299
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,440
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Oh, that's definitely true. And it largely tried to pretend it didn't

300
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,160
Speaker 7:  exist, but like,

301
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,920
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think they were really messy with the notch for years. And this is

302
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,760
Speaker 6:  like, I think the software choice they made here was really smart and

303
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,520
Speaker 6:  good. Even if some elements of it like having to long

304
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,880
Speaker 6:  press to open it is really stupid.

305
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,680
Speaker 7:  Yeah. No, I think that's right. And to turn it into software was very clever.

306
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,240
Speaker 7:  I think I, I totally agree with

307
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,680
Speaker 6:  That. Yeah. Like, like that was like, oh wow, Apple's doing it right.

308
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,360
Speaker 7:  It just feels nifty. Like there was just something about you just, you just

309
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,680
Speaker 7:  press on the thing and it like bubbles around, it feels alive in a very cool

310
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:37,920
Speaker 7:  way.

311
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,800
Speaker 6:  Like you made an Instagram video and I kept watching it while I was working

312
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,280
Speaker 6:  on my dynamic island piece. Just the clip of like the island

313
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,040
Speaker 6:  itself. I was just like, this is just neat. Like that just looks fun.

314
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,440
Speaker 7:  It is. And I think like, I, I just love this thing that apple is doing where

315
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Speaker 7:  it's like, what if your phone, wasn't just like a large collection of apps

316
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,760
Speaker 7:  on a home screen that you do things with. So like anything that feels

317
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,880
Speaker 7:  livelier than that makes me very happy. And this is like, like I, I agree

318
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,960
Speaker 7:  with ni that there's gonna be a bunch of decisions developers have to make.

319
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,800
Speaker 7:  And I've talked to a couple of developers in the last few days who are very

320
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,600
Speaker 7:  confused about what they're going to do in their apps with this stuff,

321
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,960
Speaker 7:  because there's a lot of things you can do and like no expected behavior

322
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,000
Speaker 7:  for it. So folks are gonna take a while to figure this out, but I think it's

323
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,560
Speaker 7:  gonna be the kind of space people are gonna play with.

324
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,600
Speaker 6:  Do you use this in a weather app and like carrot right now will send you

325
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,480
Speaker 6:  a notification if it's about to rain. Is that gonna now pop up on

326
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,800
Speaker 6:  the, the dynamic island? The notch?

327
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,360
Speaker 5:  I think the answer is no, I think those are still notifications. Like again,

328
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,600
Speaker 5:  I think the way to think about this stuff right now is minimized widgets.

329
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,440
Speaker 6:  I think widgets are themselves kind of notifications, right? Like, like

330
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,280
Speaker 6:  Apple's been using notifications as widgets to some extent for a long

331
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,000
Speaker 6:  time. And then they just keep like changing the name of

332
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,960
Speaker 6:  notifications and tweaking the functionality to be like, here's a new, fresh

333
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,000
Speaker 6:  type of notification. It's called widget. Here's a newer, fresher type of

334
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,480
Speaker 6:  notification. It's called the dynamic island.

335
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,000
Speaker 7:  Well, yeah, this is where like live activities figures in too, cuz it's all,

336
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,840
Speaker 7:  there's now this like wild spectrum of rectangles. You can put on your

337
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,800
Speaker 7:  phone and they all do slightly different versions of sort of the same thing.

338
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:13,000
Speaker 5:  So as you've been playing with Iowa 16, that seems like the most important

339
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,120
Speaker 5:  new part of the whole operating system

340
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,160
Speaker 7:  Live activities.

341
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So that's the new kind of widget where if you are following

342
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,400
Speaker 5:  sports on ESPN, it'll like live, populate the score. Yep.

343
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,320
Speaker 5:  That to me is like ages ago, Josh Polski wrote in Apple's world.

344
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,960
Speaker 5:  It's always 72 and sunny because the weather app, wouldn't just tell you

345
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,560
Speaker 5:  the temperature. And it's like, they finally got all the way there. Right?

346
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,600
Speaker 5:  They like finally got all the way to apps can actually write to the screen

347
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,600
Speaker 5:  in these things called live activity, widgets

348
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,960
Speaker 7:  Almost all the way there. They're still slightly afraid of their developers

349
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,640
Speaker 7:  in that sense. But it's, it's, it's pretty close. And I think it's a huge,

350
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,600
Speaker 7:  huge, I mean the thing that you can't interact with widgets still

351
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,280
Speaker 7:  drives me insane. Right? Like widgets are still functionally like app shortcuts.

352
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,320
Speaker 7:  So that to me is like the last real thing that I want where it's like,

353
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,560
Speaker 7:  it can write to the icon, but I can't talk back to it without opening the

354
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,960
Speaker 7:  app. That's the one move apple still has not made. And

355
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,000
Speaker 7:  dynamic island stuff seems like it could have done more of that

356
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,440
Speaker 7:  too. And instead they're just like, even they still want you to go to the

357
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,080
Speaker 7:  app. Like part of me wonders how much of this is that like apple knows

358
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,800
Speaker 7:  developers want you to open their app. And so apple is petrified of anything

359
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,040
Speaker 7:  that is going to like meaningfully depreciate. The amount of time people

360
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,240
Speaker 7:  spend opening apps.

361
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,600
Speaker 5:  Oh interesting. Yeah. We'll see, like we gotta get the thing again.

362
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,360
Speaker 5:  We're basing this off of a vanishingly small amount of time. And by the way,

363
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,520
Speaker 5:  this event was wild first event in the Steve jobs theater in three years,

364
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,480
Speaker 5:  we were still watching a video, which was weird. I think it's time to let

365
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,440
Speaker 5:  that go. Apple loves it. Cuz the video streams and it travels and people

366
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,920
Speaker 5:  cut it up and like if you're playing to the internet, it's better, but there's

367
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,120
Speaker 5:  still something lost. It's also way harder to life log a video.

368
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,800
Speaker 7:  It just moves so fast.

369
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,920
Speaker 5:  No one ever takes a breath. Yeah. They should just put like breaths and applause

370
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,040
Speaker 5:  breaks and time for people to walk on and off the stage, back in the video,

371
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,960
Speaker 5:  maybe I'll be happy. It doesn't matter. We're there for the hands on. We're

372
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,560
Speaker 5:  there to talk to people. But it was, it was just the, you know, full theater,

373
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,800
Speaker 5:  the big crowded rush in the room, everyone running around

374
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,840
Speaker 5:  that part of it was great.

375
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,080
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it was. And it was the, like the energy was super high. And we talked

376
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,000
Speaker 7:  about this at, at WWDC too. There is just like, again, it's a very self-selecting

377
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
Speaker 7:  group of people who come to these things. So it's like people who are predisposed

378
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,000
Speaker 7:  to be excited about new technology, I would say. But yeah, there was still

379
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,920
Speaker 7:  this like first day of school energy again where it's like, people are

380
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,480
Speaker 7:  just like pumped to be back excited to be able to like see things and try

381
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,040
Speaker 7:  them and run around and talk to people. And folks are folks who are amped

382
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,440
Speaker 7:  to be back doing this kind of stuff, which was, which was very fun.

383
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,400
Speaker 5:  We've done like 25 minutes on the island.

384
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,280
Speaker 7:  I'm good with that. That feels right. Right. Like the iPhone 14, it's an

385
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,080
Speaker 7:  iPhone. The end. Let's talk more about the dynamic island. Well

386
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,040
Speaker 5:  The, the dynamic island is connect to the rest of the iPhone 14 pro of which

387
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,720
Speaker 5:  the two other notable features are the always on display, which

388
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,600
Speaker 5:  welcome apple, you know, apple claims, you know that

389
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,960
Speaker 5:  they did a lot of work, that they got the refresh rate down to one Hertz.

390
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,440
Speaker 5:  They have a new kind of L PTO O led display that

391
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,560
Speaker 5:  allows lower power. They could have done it before. They're waiting to invent

392
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,040
Speaker 5:  the things they needed to invent. You can just believe whatever. Well, you

393
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,760
Speaker 5:  just take whatever you want out of that and believe what you need to believe

394
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,920
Speaker 5:  to make this okay. But they're they finally have shifted and always on display

395
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,720
Speaker 5:  it. Doesn't, it's strange. Like it's more widgets, right?

396
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,600
Speaker 5:  Like why is the display always honest to show you more widgets and

397
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,960
Speaker 5:  show you more status information. They do really cool things with it. Here's

398
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,840
Speaker 5:  my favorite one. So when the display goes to, it's like low power state,

399
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,160
Speaker 5:  you know, in Iowa 16, they're doing the cool thing where the, they can cut

400
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,840
Speaker 5:  out faces and put them over the clock. When they go to the low power

401
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,440
Speaker 5:  mode, they reverse it. So the clock fades up over the face. And then when

402
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,240
Speaker 5:  you tap on the screen goes, the face comes back in front of it. It's neat.

403
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,720
Speaker 5:  That's

404
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:48,920
Speaker 7:  Cool.

405
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,200
Speaker 5:  They're doing all this like image management stuff for the wallpapers.

406
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,320
Speaker 5:  So when it goes into that super dim, low power mode, they actually preserve

407
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,880
Speaker 5:  skin tones and colors in, in different ways. So like they're doing a bunch

408
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,560
Speaker 5:  of apple stuff, you know, that maybe other companies are doing too. And just

409
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,240
Speaker 5:  don't talk about as reverently as apple talks about, but they're doing a

410
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,960
Speaker 5:  bunch of apple stuff,

411
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,720
Speaker 6:  But how long has it been since Samsung? Didn't always on

412
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,520
Speaker 6:  display five years,

413
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,880
Speaker 7:  Maybe longer. Like it's, they've had Android phones have had this forever.

414
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,800
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Cuz you, if you have an Oola display, you can just like cut the

415
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,920
Speaker 5:  power and the pixels stay static, but Apple's doing it with like some amount

416
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,880
Speaker 5:  of color. Like I think the very first, always on Oola displays actually went

417
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,560
Speaker 5:  to black and white, right.

418
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,480
Speaker 6:  The date and the time that's

419
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,960
Speaker 5:  It? Yeah. So app Apple's doing far more than that. So I think they, they

420
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,280
Speaker 5:  waited to some extent to just like do far more than that, but really you

421
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,720
Speaker 5:  tap on the thing, the display lights all the way up and you get it's interactive

422
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,880
Speaker 5:  again. If it's in your pocket or upside down, it goes totally off.

423
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,280
Speaker 7:  Yeah. They do seem to be really leaning into the idea that if you don't wanna

424
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,840
Speaker 7:  look at your phone, flip it over that that is like a, an unexpected societal

425
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,160
Speaker 7:  behavior. Now that it's like your phone is going to sort of always be staring

426
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,040
Speaker 7:  at you and if you don't want that, put it away. Which I very

427
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,120
Speaker 7:  much appreciate like as a, as a flip the phone over on the table person,

428
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,920
Speaker 7:  I very much appreciate that.

429
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:04,200
Speaker 6:  It kind of reminds me of, did you guys watch Halton catch fire,

430
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,280
Speaker 6:  best show ever made. And there's this whole thing where one of 'em becomes

431
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,120
Speaker 6:  a VC. Whenever she sits down, she has one of those leg, Jager lake tray

432
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,600
Speaker 6:  watches that like just flips over. And when she flips it over, she's like,

433
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,000
Speaker 6:  I will listen now because I'm not paying attention to the time. It's

434
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,320
Speaker 7:  Like, oh, okay. Now I care about you.

435
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,080
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It was the best thing in the world. And Apple's like, we see this,

436
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,800
Speaker 6:  we love it. You can do this too. Everyone should have this power move.

437
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,320
Speaker 6:  Just be like, now I care about you. I flipped my phone over.

438
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,560
Speaker 5:  Okay. So that's always on display. We should talk about the camera,

439
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,120
Speaker 10:  A 48 mega pixel camera with a quad pixel

440
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,640
Speaker 10:  sensor features our second generation sensor shift OIS

441
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,760
Speaker 10:  and 100%

442
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,000
Speaker 7:  Focus pixels.

443
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,080
Speaker 5:  The camera's pretty interesting. And then in some ways like, right,

444
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,120
Speaker 5:  it's still gonna deliver you 12 mega pixel photos. So it's a 48

445
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,240
Speaker 5:  megapixel sensor in the pro they're pixel bidding it in standard

446
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,600
Speaker 5:  mode. So you, you know, they're gonna use four pixels

447
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,520
Speaker 5:  to generate one. Can you

448
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,720
Speaker 7:  Explain what pixel bidding is? It's one of those things that I like, I'm

449
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,440
Speaker 7:  like 35% sure. I understand what pixel bidding is. Can you explain what pixel

450
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:09,840
Speaker 7:  bidding is?

451
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So you've got 48. I mean imagine a grid. The actually

452
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,720
Speaker 5:  the pixel pattern on this is probably not a grid. They said they have a new

453
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,240
Speaker 5:  pixel pattern on the sensor and they had to like tweak their algorithms.

454
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,120
Speaker 5:  So I don't know what the pattern is, but just for the purposes of this, imagine

455
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,040
Speaker 5:  a grid. And so what you could do is use every single pixel

456
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,560
Speaker 5:  as a pixel represented in a photo and you can do that

457
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,840
Speaker 5:  in pro and you generate a 57 megabyte follow

458
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,040
Speaker 7:  Per,

459
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,200
Speaker 5:  So you can all the data back out of the thing. Wow. That's not useful

460
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,080
Speaker 5:  for most people, especially at those file sizes. And

461
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,200
Speaker 5:  most people sharing Instagram anyway. So what apple and everyone else with

462
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,880
Speaker 5:  big sensors do is actually say, we're gonna use four of those

463
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,760
Speaker 5:  pixels to collect all the light we can and then sample them down

464
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,320
Speaker 5:  to one pixel. So you've been the pixel and that's how you end up with a 12

465
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,880
Speaker 5:  megapixel photo out of 48 megapixel sensor.

466
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,800
Speaker 6:  So it's not just cropping, like when you're using a

467
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,400
Speaker 6:  DSLR.

468
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,920
Speaker 5:  Well ho hold on your friend.

469
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,160
Speaker 5:  So like that's the standard wide camera mode, right?

470
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:16,400
Speaker 5:  So, you know, on the iPhone 14, they say they they've made the pixels on

471
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,280
Speaker 5:  the 12 mega pixel sensor, slightly bigger to collect more light. At some

472
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,840
Speaker 5:  point you just like run into the limit of doing that at scale. And it's better

473
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,760
Speaker 5:  to just have more individual pixels and sample and combine them to get more

474
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,160
Speaker 5:  light. Fair enough. Cool. So that's like the standard wide camera, one X

475
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,880
Speaker 5:  mode then Alex, the two X mode, they are

476
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,800
Speaker 5:  cropping the sensor. And they're saying, because the sensor's so big

477
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,640
Speaker 5:  that at the crop, it's still a true two X zoom,

478
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,600
Speaker 5:  which is a huge claim.

479
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,400
Speaker 7:  Yes. Yeah. Do we buy that? I feel like I am trained to think that's just

480
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,840
Speaker 7:  cropping.

481
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Our video producer here and was like outside and like I heard him

482
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,640
Speaker 5:  like hiss when they said this, like

483
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,880
Speaker 5:  I know, we'll see. Right. We gotta get the thing, but they're saying that

484
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,760
Speaker 5:  they can do that move too. Which some other phones do, some of their phones

485
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,480
Speaker 5:  don't right. Like we're figuring out what to do with the, he,

486
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,200
Speaker 5:  the huge sensors on these phones. We're not, we're not firing out 96 megapixel

487
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,760
Speaker 5:  images to people. Everyone is cropping and bidding in different ways. Then

488
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,400
Speaker 5:  the last thing you can do is the action mode that they've added to the video

489
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,000
Speaker 5:  camera, where they use the whole sensor and then they do that

490
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,920
Speaker 5:  dynamic cropping. Right? So they like pick an object in the frame. They're

491
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,880
Speaker 5:  gonna hold that steady and they're gonna move the frame around it inside

492
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,000
Speaker 5:  of the sensor area, which again, we have to

493
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,600
Speaker 7:  See, and that's what they're using to stabilize motion. And I actually think

494
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,320
Speaker 7:  if that's as good as it looked in that demo where it was like the sort of

495
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,800
Speaker 7:  camera running behind a runner and on the left it's ultra shaky and on the

496
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,760
Speaker 7:  right, it was super still, if that's that good, that's gonna be like

497
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,640
Speaker 7:  a gigantic improvement for a lot of people who make video.

498
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,280
Speaker 7:  Cuz it's the kind of thing that is like everybody buys these wacky gimbles

499
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,520
Speaker 7:  and does all kinds of crazy stuff. And if that is like an even like B plus

500
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,400
Speaker 7:  solved problem, now that's a really big deal. But it is also the kind of

501
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,040
Speaker 7:  thing that we have seen in the past is really hard to do without all that

502
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,840
Speaker 7:  like hideous warping and really ugly artifacting as people

503
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,680
Speaker 7:  move. Like I'm, that's one thing I'm very curious to see the test result

504
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:08,880
Speaker 7:  of.

505
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,240
Speaker 6:  Well, that's like a problem that Sony's face too, right? Like, cuz they've

506
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,080
Speaker 6:  tried to do that kind of stuff with video and

507
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,040
Speaker 6:  it always, you get that warping motion and it's really hard to do. Yeah.

508
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,800
Speaker 6:  It's super hard.

509
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,440
Speaker 5:  So we'll see. And they've brought that same mode to the FN 14, which has

510
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,120
Speaker 5:  a regular 12 megapixel sensor. So we'll see if they're even

511
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,960
Speaker 5:  different. Right. Cuz they're still shooting 4k video, which is only the

512
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,600
Speaker 5:  same area on the sensor. We, we just kind of don't know, but

513
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,520
Speaker 5:  yeah, they're, they're using the 48 megapixel sensor on the pro

514
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,360
Speaker 5:  in like several different ways. Like there are modes that it

515
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,200
Speaker 5:  goes into. One is the like pixel bend. It's actually just

516
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,120
Speaker 5:  a gigantic 12 megapixel sensor. The other is the

517
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,000
Speaker 5:  crop. We cut it down and we're using 12 megapixels out of the

518
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,400
Speaker 5:  middle. The other way is this like action mode. And then that you can switch

519
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,480
Speaker 5:  it in prayer on just like use it as a 48 mega sensor, which will generate

520
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,240
Speaker 5:  gigantic images of which we will have to like look at and see if you

521
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,280
Speaker 5:  lose anything by not pixelating them.

522
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,200
Speaker 6:  So they're really like, these are all, I mean, I don't know about phones

523
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,560
Speaker 6:  as much, but these are all methodologies that like Sony's been using for

524
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,520
Speaker 6:  years and it's DSLRs to like,

525
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,360
Speaker 5:  Oh this it's and Samsung. Yeah. And like everybody, like apple

526
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:22,200
Speaker 5:  is two years, three years behind

527
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,520
Speaker 5:  the let's put a big sensor and use it in funky ways. Trend.

528
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,520
Speaker 5:  Certainly the, you know, like the S phones have had this for a while.

529
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:34,000
Speaker 5:  Huawei phones have done this for a while. Like, like the trend is you

530
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,760
Speaker 5:  can only make the pixel so big or pack them so densely before you start

531
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,880
Speaker 5:  introducing errors or bad pixels. So you're, you're better move

532
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,920
Speaker 5:  is to pack in more pixels and then, and then bin them.

533
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,720
Speaker 5:  And that's like what we've been seeing across the industry. So Apple's like

534
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,960
Speaker 5:  coming to it. We have to see what sensor they're using. Right. They have

535
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,360
Speaker 5:  traditional use Sony sensors. We don't know if they're still using a, like,

536
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,720
Speaker 5:  there's a million things you gotta figure out. But it's funny cuz it's like

537
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,600
Speaker 5:  now known like I know what to go review it against and how to review it

538
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,920
Speaker 5:  because they're late. But it seems like they, they are doing at least a couple

539
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,840
Speaker 5:  more interesting things.

540
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,840
Speaker 6:  All right. I'm gonna ask you a question as that. I get from my mom

541
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,960
Speaker 6:  every year. She's asked me this question every year for the last seven years

542
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,840
Speaker 6:  and I hate it. And so I wanna pass on the pain to someone else, which

543
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,680
Speaker 6:  will be better for her to take photos, this phone or her

544
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,440
Speaker 6:  digital camera from 2003,

545
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,640
Speaker 5:  The phone that, that answers. What are you talking about?

546
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,200
Speaker 5:  That, that answer is like five years outta date.

547
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,080
Speaker 6:  I just needed this, this so I can send it to her to maybe finally

548
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,680
Speaker 6:  get her to stop using that digital camera. Is

549
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,720
Speaker 7:  She recording onto like mini VHS's?

550
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,120
Speaker 6:  No, she's got like, she's got like a CF card in it and

551
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,440
Speaker 6:  it's a crappy, like it's like a cannon point and shoot from

552
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,160
Speaker 6:  2003.

553
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,080
Speaker 5:  Right. That thing has like a, like a posted, like not even a posted, it has

554
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,640
Speaker 5:  like a quarter inch sensor. Yeah. And has a slow lens. And she probably

555
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,560
Speaker 5:  zooms with the slow lens and makes it even slower

556
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,640
Speaker 5:  rights. Like throw that like go to her house and was like throw it away and

557
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,200
Speaker 5:  just like leave an iPhone 12 in its place. And the iPhone 12 will be massively

558
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,040
Speaker 5:  superior to this thing.

559
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,520
Speaker 6:  No, I have to, I have to give her this, this audio clip.

560
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. What's your mom's name? I can address her directly. Phyllis Phyllis,

561
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,600
Speaker 5:  let me talk to you. Settle in, throw away your camera

562
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,560
Speaker 5:  and buy any modern cell phone. It will be faster and better for you

563
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,000
Speaker 5:  and you'll be able to more easily share photos with your daughter.

564
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,840
Speaker 6:  Thank you. There it is. It's like little postage stamps.

565
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,320
Speaker 7:  That's another thing apple did actually is put in faster aperture lenses

566
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,120
Speaker 7:  into, I think all four of the phones. Oh really? I could be wrong. Yeah.

567
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,560
Speaker 7:  But I'm pretty sure every lens is faster. And that's another one of those

568
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,400
Speaker 7:  things that is like the kind of thing. Most people don't notice, but just

569
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,320
Speaker 7:  like instantly makes all of your photos slightly better. I'm very excited

570
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:40,520
Speaker 7:  about

571
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,320
Speaker 5:  That. And then they added, I think they did this just to troll me. I gotta

572
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,960
Speaker 5:  be honest with you. I'm pretty sure they did this just to troll me. They

573
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Speaker 5:  were like, remember deep fusion and they literally showed a picture of a

574
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,240
Speaker 5:  person wearing a sweater. Yes.

575
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,680
Speaker 6:  That was just all for

576
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,520
Speaker 7:  You. Sweater mode.

577
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,040
Speaker 5:  What are we doing? And they're like, we've moved deep fusion

578
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,800
Speaker 5:  earlier in the process of taking the photo.

579
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,640
Speaker 6:  Oh sure.

580
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,120
Speaker 5:  And now we are calling that the photonic engine.

581
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,240
Speaker 5:  Sure. Like, sure. Here's this thing that

582
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,280
Speaker 5:  no one understood anyway, like, do you remember when they're like deep fusion

583
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,320
Speaker 5:  is here and they rolled it out? Yeah. And you're like, what does it do

584
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,360
Speaker 6:  Sweaters.

585
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,440
Speaker 5:  But it like, perceptively does very little and maybe it's, maybe it's doing

586
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,280
Speaker 5:  a lot and it's generating like a 5% change and that's very apple to make

587
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,520
Speaker 5:  a big hype about it. But you know, but like this is like they moved it early

588
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,240
Speaker 5:  in the process. And then the claim is that all these cameras

589
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,160
Speaker 5:  will perform better in low light because deep fusion is earlier in the process.

590
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,000
Speaker 5:  Okay. So it's up to two X better on the front camera in low

591
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,840
Speaker 5:  light against what? By the way, unspecified.

592
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:45,000
Speaker 5:  So it's up to two X better on the front camera, the telephoto

593
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,600
Speaker 5:  and the main camera. And apparently it's up to three X better

594
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,480
Speaker 5:  on the ultra one

595
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,240
Speaker 7:  Up to three X. Better. Not it's not necessarily three it's

596
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,200
Speaker 5:  Just but against what last year's phone, the first iPhone. Who

597
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,040
Speaker 5:  knows. Do

598
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,880
Speaker 7:  You think they're comparing it to Phyllis's digital camera? Yeah. Phyllis

599
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,760
Speaker 7:  is just out there shooting.

600
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,600
Speaker 5:  We have a cannon L SD 400

601
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,600
Speaker 5:  and it's up to three X. Better than that. Boom.

602
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,240
Speaker 6:  Buy it.

603
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:15,760
Speaker 5:  I had a cannon L SD 400. That camera. That camera got me through a

604
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,960
Speaker 5:  lot of nights at the bar. That's actually why you bought those cameras. You're

605
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,640
Speaker 5:  like one day someone will spill a beer fully on this. It'll be fine. That'll

606
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,680
Speaker 5:  be fine. Yep. Yeah. And then they added some video features, right? So the

607
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,960
Speaker 5:  cinematic mode can add 4k 30 and 4k 24.

608
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:33,240
Speaker 5:  I tried to test this out. I will tell you that cinematic mode does

609
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,160
Speaker 5:  not like being in a room with hundreds of faces. It

610
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,880
Speaker 5:  just lost its mind. Like again, true. Tremendously

611
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,440
Speaker 5:  unfair, right? Yeah. But it was like who, who, who should be blurry? I don't

612
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,400
Speaker 5:  know. I'm freaking out. So we'll try it again when I get a review

613
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,800
Speaker 6:  Because it just focuses like on one face. It's like facial.

614
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I tried to blurry it out. So it just like couldn't decide who I

615
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,360
Speaker 5:  cared about. You know, like yeah. Which of these people should be in focus.

616
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,000
Speaker 5:  So

617
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,640
Speaker 6:  Was it like the visual representation of smart homes having to decide who,

618
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,680
Speaker 6:  who to listen to when you, they adjust the, the temperature,

619
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,160
Speaker 5:  Just it just, and the poor person in the demo was like, it's not gonna work.

620
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,360
Speaker 5:  You

621
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,520
Speaker 6:  Like don't

622
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,840
Speaker 5:  Even try. I mean, look, I, I think the pro is great. I'm excited to review

623
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,400
Speaker 5:  it. I'm excited like orders right now. I'm sure people are gonna, regardless

624
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,240
Speaker 5:  of whatever review says, I, the thing to me though is I'm, I'm just

625
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,440
Speaker 5:  watching our gift that we clipped out of the video and it's like, they show

626
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,600
Speaker 5:  the big widget a lot.

627
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,400
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

628
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it's actually not the, it's not the user flow that you would expect

629
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,040
Speaker 5:  in, in using it. And that's the cool part, right? Like you've got the

630
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,320
Speaker 5:  airplane app. Boy, do I have thoughts about airplane app design?

631
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,560
Speaker 5:  Like airlines, if you're listening, like I've been on a lot of different

632
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,200
Speaker 5:  airlines in the past couple days, all of them are bad. You got

633
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,680
Speaker 6:  Feelings,

634
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,600
Speaker 5:  But like the cool one, right? We, you, you got your flight coming and you

635
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,960
Speaker 5:  like it opens and it shows you the plane flying over the thing and estimated

636
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,480
Speaker 5:  time like that stuff is amazing. And it's not actually what happens.

637
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:00,120
Speaker 5:  Like you tap on it. It's gonna kick you into an app. So I think that's the

638
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,280
Speaker 5:  flow that needs to get figured out.

639
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,280
Speaker 7:  You want the dynamic island to just show your plane flying from one end

640
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,320
Speaker 7:  of the island to the other.

641
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,400
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

642
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:11,240
Speaker 5:  Well I just, it's neat that that's what they're showing like. Yeah. That's

643
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,920
Speaker 5:  the cool part about this is you got these little minimized widgets and you

644
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,960
Speaker 5:  tap 'em you get the big widget and they look really cool. Right? Yep. And

645
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,800
Speaker 5:  like there's a reason they're showing it. They're not showing you bouncing

646
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,760
Speaker 5:  into the American airlines app, which

647
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,680
Speaker 5:  is just one of the worst experiences you can have

648
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,720
Speaker 5:  as a human being. They're like, no, here's a cool animation that shows you

649
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,120
Speaker 5:  what you need right away. And like, I think they'll, I think they'll get

650
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,760
Speaker 5:  there or they'll give you, they'll give me a switch real

651
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,160
Speaker 7:  Quick before you take a break. One more question on this. I, I was debating

652
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,080
Speaker 7:  this with somebody the other day. And I'm curious what you guys think. Do

653
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,760
Speaker 7:  you think people know like the average iPhone user, that

654
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,640
Speaker 7:  you can even long press on stuff to find more information because

655
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,760
Speaker 7:  like the not at all the edit message thing is coming in in messages

656
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,640
Speaker 7:  and that's underneath a long press. And like apple is increasingly doing

657
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,840
Speaker 7:  more and more of these features and putting them under long presses. And

658
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,520
Speaker 7:  my stance is basically like, as soon as you do that, you assume 95% of your

659
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,840
Speaker 7:  users are never gonna find it. But I've talked to people who were like, no

660
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,360
Speaker 7:  people know,

661
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:10,880
Speaker 5:  No, they had 3d touch. Remember they had pressure sensitive screens and they

662
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,280
Speaker 5:  were useless and they threw 'em away. Yeah. This is the company that still

663
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,160
Speaker 5:  will not ship a multi button mouse. Right. Because they,

664
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,600
Speaker 5:  at their core believed that everything should be on the surface of the interface.

665
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,560
Speaker 5:  And then the phone is like, right. Clicks for days. Like all,

666
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,840
Speaker 5:  all this is is right. Clicking. Yeah. Right. Like at a very basic level,

667
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,240
Speaker 5:  they've added right. Clicks to the phone. And it's cool if you are like,

668
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,320
Speaker 5:  my mouse has 10 buttons. Like I love an alternative click,

669
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,280
Speaker 5:  but most people like will never find it. Yeah. I think that's right. I think

670
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,520
Speaker 5:  a lot of the, the dynamic they should have called it, the dynamic notch,

671
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,120
Speaker 5:  I think they wanted to get away from the word notch. And so here we are at

672
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,960
Speaker 5:  island, I think all of the island stuff is right.

673
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,840
Speaker 5:  Clicks in like the, they, they just need to flip that around. We haven't

674
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,360
Speaker 5:  talked about this other phone at all. We should we take a break and talk

675
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,160
Speaker 5:  about the other phone? Who cares? We're gonna take a break. We're gonna have

676
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,240
Speaker 5:  that argument in the background.

677
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,640
Speaker 5:  We'll be right back.

678
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,180
Speaker 11:  Hi, I'm Kara Swisher for decades. I've covered Silicon valley, Washington

679
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,060
Speaker 11:  and Hollywood making sense of those worlds by talking directly to the people

680
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,940
Speaker 11:  who shaped them. Elon Musk, Barack Obama, Tony Fauci,

681
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,140
Speaker 11:  Kim Kardashian. I've had the pleasure of grilling them all.

682
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,340
Speaker 11:  Now I'm launching a new show called the Joe Rogan experience with Kara

683
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,100
Speaker 11:  Swisher. Just kidding. It's actually called on with Kara

684
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,060
Speaker 11:  Swisher. And let me tell you, it is on no holds barred

685
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,020
Speaker 11:  on the tough questions or on my opinions on with Kara Swisher

686
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,620
Speaker 11:  launches September 26th from New York magazine and the V media podcast

687
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,420
Speaker 11:  network, just look for on with Kara Swisher in your podcast app

688
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,140
Speaker 11:  and hit, follow or subscribe.

689
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,820
Speaker 12:  The Iowa lottery was out there saying on a regular basis, Hey folks, check

690
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,580
Speaker 12:  your ticket. Somebody's got 16 million bucks and it was sort of this mystery.

691
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,820
Speaker 12:  Why hasn't anyone come forward?

692
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,980
Speaker 13:  I'm Phoebe judge host of the podcast, criminal, true

693
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,500
Speaker 13:  stories about people who've done wrong. Been wronged or gotten caught somewhere

694
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,420
Speaker 13:  in the middle, told by people who know them best like a man

695
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,140
Speaker 13:  who successfully figured out how to negotiate with his father's kidnappers.

696
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,020
Speaker 13:  After some trial and error,

697
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,460
Speaker 14:  They were just like for that price, we won't even tell you where he's buried.

698
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,580
Speaker 13:  And a 12 year old who solved a family mystery.

699
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,740
Speaker 15:  There were three little fingerprints. And I remember in junior da

700
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,860
Speaker 15:  camp, I was like, oh, fingerprints. This is definitely some evidence. Then

701
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,500
Speaker 15:  we can find whoever broke into my grandmother's house,

702
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,700
Speaker 13:  Discover the unexpected side of true crime.

703
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,940
Speaker 16:  There were no security alarms whatsoever. The file

704
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,700
Speaker 16:  cabinets were not even locked. So that gave us enough information

705
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,500
Speaker 16:  to plan the actual break in, listen

706
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,260
Speaker 13:  To criminal. Now, wherever you get your podcasts,

707
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,970
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back. We have to talk to the FN 14 plus, which is a very

708
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,370
Speaker 5:  minor improvement over the 13.

709
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,410
Speaker 17:  IPhone 14 also has an updated internal design that

710
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,010
Speaker 17:  improves thermal performance, which is great for staying in the action

711
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,530
Speaker 17:  longer

712
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,730
Speaker 5:  Processor from last year's pro the a 15 bionic cool

713
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:18,370
Speaker 5:  minor upgrades to the cameras. Cool. Faster it lenses. Mostly

714
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,490
Speaker 5:  the photonic engine, extra sweater mode, super sweater mode. Yeah.

715
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,610
Speaker 5:  Super sweater mode. And, oh, we, we didn't talk about this before at all.

716
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,450
Speaker 5:  It's got the satellite thing. Yep.

717
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,650
Speaker 15:  Which is a subscription, right?

718
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,850
Speaker 5:  Well, they get it free for two years and

719
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,050
Speaker 15:  Then you have to pay for it

720
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:36,080
Speaker 5:  And then you have to pay for it or buy a new phone, buy a new phone and get

721
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,160
Speaker 5:  it

722
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,800
Speaker 7:  For free. Can we actually talk about this? Because I have been trying to

723
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,760
Speaker 7:  decide since this event, whether or not this is

724
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,720
Speaker 7:  actually cool because it's one of those things that like, one of the themes

725
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,680
Speaker 7:  of the apple event was the apocalypse is coming slash you are going

726
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,320
Speaker 7:  to get lost in the woods. Very soon.

727
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,800
Speaker 5:  You're gonna be in a car crash and a computer should know about

728
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,120
Speaker 7:  It. Yeah. Like, like, but like it's coming, it's like, it's next week. You're

729
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,640
Speaker 7:  gonna get in a car crash. Apple. Can't tell you how it knows, but it knows.

730
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,000
Speaker 7:  Can

731
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,680
Speaker 5:  I just, can we talk about the one weirdest piece of staging at this whole

732
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,640
Speaker 5:  event? Sure. Utterly bizarre. So first of all, lots of car

733
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,680
Speaker 5:  crashes at the apple

734
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,520
Speaker 7:  Event. So many,

735
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,240
Speaker 5:  Every product introduction was accompanied by a video of a car crash

736
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,760
Speaker 5:  straight up. And then they would say something like, we hope you never have

737
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,800
Speaker 5:  to use this feature. And it's like, shit, me too. Like,

738
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,800
Speaker 7:  And then you started running around asking executives how many cars they

739
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,640
Speaker 7:  crashed and nobody would answer your question,

740
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,560
Speaker 5:  But okay. But here's the weirdest one in the apple watch I went talk about,

741
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,640
Speaker 5:  they were like, here's a bunch of letters that people have written to Tim

742
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,160
Speaker 5:  cook about how the apple watch like saved

743
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,440
Speaker 7:  Their life.

744
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,920
Speaker 18:  I placed my apple watch on his wrist and I couldn't believe my eyes,

745
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,400
Speaker 18:  an atrial fibrillation notification popped up holy

746
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:43,920
Speaker 18:  cow.

747
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,360
Speaker 5:  And they got the actual people to read the letters, like recreate the letters.

748
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,240
Speaker 5:  And it was like very moving, right. People are like, and it's the stuff that

749
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,640
Speaker 5:  you would expect. My heart started racing. My friends' heart started racing.

750
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,840
Speaker 5:  I went to the doctor. They were like, thank God you're

751
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,920
Speaker 7:  Here. There was also a guy who had a bear in his house just to like, it was

752
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,840
Speaker 7:  a wide spectrum of things,

753
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,800
Speaker 5:  But like familiar in the scheme of the apple watch shape of

754
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,760
Speaker 5:  my life. Except maybe for the bear. Then there's a woman who was like,

755
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,520
Speaker 5:  I was in a plane crash and I came to and like,

756
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:18,400
Speaker 5:  I pushed a button and I watched and what I called and it was like, but they,

757
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,160
Speaker 5:  because it was a recreation, they had her sitting in a crashed plane.

758
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,600
Speaker 5:  And I was like, did you take a plane crash survivor? And be like,

759
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,120
Speaker 5:  sit in. We built a crashed plane for you to sit in for

760
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,920
Speaker 5:  our a, like, it was just a bizarre, like that's

761
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,560
Speaker 5:  too much.

762
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,760
Speaker 7:  Or the guy who was like, I almost got crushed by the trash compactor,

763
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,280
Speaker 7:  in my garbage truck, standing there reading it into his garbage truck. It's

764
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,640
Speaker 7:  like, it's like, man,

765
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,800
Speaker 5:  That one made sense. Cause the garbage truck was like functional.

766
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,040
Speaker 5:  Right? He was like back at work at his, with his truck. This was like, they

767
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,840
Speaker 5:  had to make a plane crash. Well, there's two choices here. Someone

768
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,560
Speaker 5:  built a plane crash and they had a physical plane crash set or

769
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,640
Speaker 5:  you know, the crack apple TV production company. It was like, sit on the

770
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,520
Speaker 5:  screen screen. We're not gonna tell you what happens. And they matted in

771
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,240
Speaker 5:  a plane crash.

772
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:10,600
Speaker 5:  Like either way. It's like someone had to make a plane crash

773
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,840
Speaker 5:  for this poor woman to sit in. We're far away from satellite connectivity.

774
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,600
Speaker 5:  I just, it jumped out to me so immediately. Yeah. Like you took a plane

775
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,080
Speaker 5:  crash provider and like, I need you to sit in this plane crash and tell me

776
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,240
Speaker 5:  how to watch save your life. I can't even imagine what that day of shooting

777
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,520
Speaker 5:  was like. Let's just talk about that for the rest of the show. This is just

778
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,440
Speaker 5:  very traumatic

779
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,040
Speaker 7:  For a

780
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,280
Speaker 5:  Person. Oh, well she seemed happy. Who knows? So this is like the theme as

781
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,040
Speaker 5:  David was talking about, right? The watch can attack a car crash. The phone

782
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,600
Speaker 5:  can detect a car crash. If you're lost somewhere, you can

783
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,760
Speaker 5:  hold up your phone and connect. We think we've learned the company's globe

784
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,120
Speaker 5:  star.

785
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,240
Speaker 7:  Oh, interesting.

786
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,000
Speaker 5:  In our, in our preview episode, we're saying there was, there's a big spectrum

787
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:50,040
Speaker 5:  of ways that phone can connect to a satellite. One is cell

788
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,520
Speaker 5:  towers in space, full connectivity. There's a bunch of companies doing that,

789
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,320
Speaker 5:  like link and others. Another is star link, which is basically

790
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,320
Speaker 5:  cell towers in space. They're doing that with T-Mobile in slightly different

791
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,120
Speaker 5:  way. And then all the way down the line is very low data transmission in

792
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,040
Speaker 5:  emergencies and apple went with very low data transmission in emergencies.

793
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,440
Speaker 5:  So you can only send text messages in an emergency and

794
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,680
Speaker 5:  that's it. And you can only really send text messages. I understand it to

795
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,920
Speaker 5:  emergency services,

796
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,000
Speaker 7:  Right? It's yeah, it is. It's the equivalent of like the thing when you don't

797
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,080
Speaker 7:  have any service, but you can call 9 1 1. It's like that's, that's essentially

798
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,920
Speaker 7:  what it's just sort of expanding out. And there was a line in

799
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,720
Speaker 7:  it where he was basically like, we've done a bunch of work to

800
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:34,840
Speaker 7:  shrink the size of a message down to a third of its normal size,

801
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,720
Speaker 7:  which is already like a hilarious thing. Because the text message is like

802
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,840
Speaker 7:  not a large thing. And he was like, so you can send a message in as little

803
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,080
Speaker 7:  as 15 seconds. And it's like, wait.

804
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:47,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And you need perfect line of sight, the satellite. So Starlink eat

805
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,400
Speaker 5:  your heart out, right? Yeah. This isn't a tree might be in

806
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,800
Speaker 5:  the way it's the phone puts up UI. That's like, here's the satellite

807
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,160
Speaker 5:  point, your phone directly at the satellite, holding it up in

808
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,720
Speaker 5:  the air. And then effectively the UI is like Clippy for

809
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,360
Speaker 5:  emergencies

810
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,440
Speaker 6:  That feels like not super productive. And like you have to text someone.

811
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,240
Speaker 5:  Right. So the idea, so when I say it's Clippy for emergencies, they're like,

812
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,080
Speaker 5:  we've built this system of common messages and applies

813
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,520
Speaker 5:  you might want to send, which I think is how they're doing some of the compression.

814
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,160
Speaker 5:  Right? They're like they, they have known messages and they can yeah.

815
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,640
Speaker 5:  Send codes instead of the messages. So it's like even an accident, like,

816
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,480
Speaker 5:  do you need help? And you like push one and like go. And then if the emergency

817
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:34,120
Speaker 5:  service provider that's near you doesn't accept text messages.

818
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:38,080
Speaker 5:  They have relay stations where people receive your text messages

819
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,040
Speaker 5:  and call the emergency services for you.

820
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:44,360
Speaker 6:  Okay. Cuz that was the part like generally speaking, when you don't

821
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,160
Speaker 6:  have connectivity, it's because you're in a more rural place where emergency

822
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,000
Speaker 6:  services probably are not as often technical, technologically advanced.

823
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:56,040
Speaker 6:  So the likelihood of like them having the ability to receive your

824
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,000
Speaker 6:  text messages in Abilene, Texas small.

825
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:02,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So we don't know. So I've seen a lot of reports that Apple's partner

826
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,640
Speaker 5:  with globe star for this, even some reports on how much they've paid

827
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,280
Speaker 5:  globe star to do this. Right? Like we gotta confirm all those

828
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:14,160
Speaker 5:  details of how it works. But like who sits in the relay center? Is it

829
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,080
Speaker 5:  open question? I think, is it apple? Does apple staff a bunch of relay centers

830
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,280
Speaker 5:  or is it like GlobeStar, they're in a contract and they say they're apple

831
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,040
Speaker 5:  like lots of details there, but fundamentally it's, you're in an accident.

832
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,800
Speaker 5:  You don't have connectivity in the middle of nowhere. If you can point your

833
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,280
Speaker 5:  phone at the right spot in the sky, you can have a sort of scripted

834
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,760
Speaker 5:  conversation that gets you help.

835
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,760
Speaker 6:  Does it only activate if you're in an accident? Like if the bear

836
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,280
Speaker 6:  is in your house, how do you,

837
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,680
Speaker 5:  I don't think there's any situation which you buy an iPhone 14

838
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:44,840
Speaker 5:  just in case in your off the grid house, a bear

839
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,680
Speaker 5:  enters. And then you pointed at the sky to text

840
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,520
Speaker 5:  emergency services.

841
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,400
Speaker 7:  Bear here. Well,

842
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,720
Speaker 6:  No that's so I, I was just like, how do you activate? How do you activate

843
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,800
Speaker 6:  that emergency thing? The use case you're talking about is somebody's in

844
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,080
Speaker 6:  a crash and apple talked a lot about like, well, we can detect crashes now,

845
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,680
Speaker 6:  but when are the situations where you aren't in a crash, but you

846
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,760
Speaker 6:  do need emergency services

847
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,400
Speaker 5:  And you can just hold on that button on your phone, just like now. Yeah.

848
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,320
Speaker 7:  I believe it's a, it's not connected to the like crash

849
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,480
Speaker 7:  detection and stuff. That it is a separate thing.

850
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,920
Speaker 6:  Okay. So it's just like an individual thing and you can be like help.

851
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. So like when you, you know, right now, if you like, hold the

852
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,120
Speaker 5:  two buttons down on your phone, you can like go to emergency mode.

853
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,800
Speaker 6:  I learn new things about my phone every day on the verge cast.

854
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,120
Speaker 5:  Here are your choices. When you want to turn your phone, if you hold the,

855
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,200
Speaker 5:  the volume in this, the power button down and you can turn the phone off,

856
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,360
Speaker 5:  you can get your medical ID or you can do an SOS. Right. And like picking

857
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,360
Speaker 5:  the wrong one at the wrong time. Seems very

858
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,280
Speaker 7:  Fraught, which is also how babies like to call 9 1 1

859
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,680
Speaker 7:  by pressing all the buttons on your phone and then seeing what happens.

860
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,480
Speaker 7:  But no, the, the thing that's interesting to me about this is like investing

861
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,200
Speaker 7:  in all the satellite stuff for like the watch ultra, which we're gonna talk

862
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,440
Speaker 7:  about. Makes a lot of sense to me because it's, it is like a group of people

863
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,000
Speaker 7:  who need this stuff and know that they need it are likely to buy these

864
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,920
Speaker 7:  devices. Right. This is the kind of thing that I would assume the earth

865
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,560
Speaker 7:  shattering. Majority of iPhone users will never once experience

866
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:09,480
Speaker 7:  in the entire time that they had this phone. So it was surprising to me that

867
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,400
Speaker 7:  this was like a thing that not only did apple building to the phone and,

868
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,240
Speaker 7:  and all, all of the models of the phone. Right. But like spend a lot

869
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,200
Speaker 7:  of time telling us about in launching the phone. And so the, the like galaxy

870
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,080
Speaker 7:  brand version of this is like, okay, what is this? The like one version of,

871
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,600
Speaker 7:  and it's like, okay, is apple eventually gonna do? I was talking to somebody

872
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,040
Speaker 7:  who was like, their big theory is eventually apple is gonna like obviate

873
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,160
Speaker 7:  all the carriers by doing its own fully satellite based infrastructure.

874
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,080
Speaker 5:  Apple loves the carriers. Now the carrier, like that is a

875
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,120
Speaker 5:  lucrative relationship. Yeah.

876
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,200
Speaker 7:  Yeah. The carriers pay for all the ads for iPhones. It's a perfect setup.

877
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,000
Speaker 7:  But then if it's not that though, then like, what is the

878
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:51,240
Speaker 7:  five year plan here that makes this relevant to more than this teeny

879
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,880
Speaker 7:  tiny fraction of iPhone users? Or does there just not need to be one?

880
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,200
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I don't think there was one. I think this was just like, this is a

881
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,120
Speaker 6:  cool feature. There's not a lot going on with the iPhone 14. This is a way

882
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,280
Speaker 6:  to differentiate it from the iPhone 13. Yeah.

883
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,200
Speaker 5:  They said that big technical achievement here is they got the antennas to

884
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,080
Speaker 5:  switch to the satellite bands. So they didn't have to add a bulky plastic

885
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,960
Speaker 5:  content. Like there's obviously a lot of technical work here that has been

886
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,920
Speaker 5:  done, but the future is cell towers in

887
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,760
Speaker 5:  space. Yeah. Right. And actually Elon, God bless Elon tweeted. Like

888
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,040
Speaker 5:  of course I've talked to the iPhone team. They're very smart. And it's like,

889
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,480
Speaker 5:  sure, you have, so who knows what you've done? Self-driving taxis will be

890
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,840
Speaker 5:  roaming the streets of America tomorrow

891
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,920
Speaker 7:  Two years ago. Yeah.

892
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:33,720
Speaker 5:  Like, sure. But he's like turning a Starling satellite into a cell

893
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,400
Speaker 5:  tower space is not the end goal. And that's where that's the state of the

894
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,920
Speaker 5:  art right now is a cell tower space. So I, I think there's probably a lot

895
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,600
Speaker 5:  of work to be done here, but right now what you've got is like Clippy for

896
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,120
Speaker 5:  emergencies,

897
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,840
Speaker 7:  Which is fine. And it does seem to be true that apple

898
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:52,920
Speaker 7:  is leaning harder into this thing that it is like the apple

899
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,640
Speaker 7:  watch can save your life. Like, I it's very clear that that like means

900
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,880
Speaker 7:  something to apple. And they're like, not only is this like a hell of a marketing

901
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,800
Speaker 7:  scheme, but they seem to actually buy this theory that this

902
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,400
Speaker 7:  is meaningful to people in that way.

903
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,560
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And Nicole wrote about it on the site. Like a lot of the message here

904
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,000
Speaker 5:  is like unsupported by research fear

905
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,840
Speaker 5:  Moning yes. But dressed up, right? Like the apple

906
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,520
Speaker 5:  watch can monitor temperature, but they can't make medical claims. Cause

907
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,200
Speaker 5:  it's not cleared by the FDA. So who knows the apple watch can monitor

908
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,040
Speaker 5:  your blood oxygen, but it's not cleared by the FDA. So who knows, like a

909
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,760
Speaker 5:  lot of the heart detection stuff that they've done study in

910
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,400
Speaker 5:  2020 found led to nothing but caused a burden

911
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:39,160
Speaker 5:  in interpreting in additional testing in the healthcare system. That's not

912
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,800
Speaker 5:  discounting the fact that people have had their lives saved by the apple

913
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,720
Speaker 5:  watch, but they're, they're leaning into it in a way that they have to connect

914
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,280
Speaker 5:  it to reality at the end, right.

915
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,080
Speaker 7:  Life saving at scale is a very different thing.

916
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,480
Speaker 5:  So we start with the watches. We have not talked about the iPhone 14 plus,

917
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,360
Speaker 5:  should we talk about it?

918
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:59,880
Speaker 7:  No, that feels right. We just, just that moment we talked about the iPhone

919
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,000
Speaker 7:  14 plus exactly. As much as we should. I will say, I do think a lot of people

920
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,320
Speaker 7:  are gonna buy the iPhone 14 plus. Oh yeah. This is the NELI Patel big, cheap

921
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,120
Speaker 7:  screen theory. Right? Like it's cheaper than the other big one and

922
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,840
Speaker 7:  it's big and it's the exact same phone as the F and 14, like

923
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,600
Speaker 6:  Great, very convenient that they're putting it out and they're not doing

924
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,360
Speaker 6:  a mini this year.

925
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,760
Speaker 5:  I'm telling you ever you can. Wh all you want

926
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:24,440
Speaker 6:  They're they're just trying to like feed your theory. Alison

927
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,040
Speaker 6:  will back me up on this. If she's on the show again, they're just, they're,

928
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,760
Speaker 6:  they're feeding your theory that people love big phones, but that's because

929
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,960
Speaker 6:  they don't offer 'em at the same time.

930
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:37,080
Speaker 5:  Oh, I see what you mean. No, no, no. They offered both at the same time and

931
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,840
Speaker 5:  people still bought the big ones so much. They got rid of the little one.

932
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,280
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Apple famous for putting out products that people don't want. Just

933
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,880
Speaker 7:  despite Eli. That would say that, that happens a lot.

934
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:51,480
Speaker 5:  I will, we got there in like a lot of people there had listened to our episode

935
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,360
Speaker 5:  and they're like, so you want a TV? Huh? He's like, sure. Do. I'm just

936
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,840
Speaker 5:  telling you big cheap screens always win the difference in price between

937
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,680
Speaker 5:  the little pro and the big plus is a hundred bucks. And like in

938
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,000
Speaker 5:  any rational universe you would upgrade and get the dynamic island and the

939
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,280
Speaker 5:  better camera and the all the, and everyone's gonna buy the plus instead.

940
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,160
Speaker 5:  Yep. Without, without question,

941
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,520
Speaker 7:  Which one are you guys gonna buy?

942
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:13,920
Speaker 5:  The pro max?

943
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:15,080
Speaker 6:  I, I already got the pro

944
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,480
Speaker 7:  Big or little, little,

945
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:16,960
Speaker 6:  All

946
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,480
Speaker 5:  Right. We said we, weren't gonna talk about the plus. And here we are, we

947
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,200
Speaker 5:  should talk about the watches.

948
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:24,400
Speaker 19:  This is the new apple watch series eight. It

949
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,280
Speaker 19:  features a big brilliant, always on display with narrow borders that push

950
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,760
Speaker 19:  the screen right to the

951
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,840
Speaker 5:  Edge. So speaking big cheap screens, apple watch eight

952
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,760
Speaker 5:  huge screen. People are gonna upgrade just to get the, the big screen. Yeah.

953
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,040
Speaker 5:  Added a temperature sensor. They can do cycle tracking, which is really interesting.

954
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,960
Speaker 5:  A lot of apps have done this over time. They can, they can only

955
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:47,960
Speaker 5:  retroactively tell you an ovulation is they can't predict it, which is

956
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:52,080
Speaker 5:  just another one of those like apples making claims, right. At

957
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,360
Speaker 5:  the limit of the claims they can make. Yeah. But they can't go farther,

958
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,520
Speaker 5:  which is interesting. Obviously, crash detection. God only knows if you

959
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,760
Speaker 5:  were in a car crash and a computer doesn't know about it. Apple is mad at

960
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,560
Speaker 5:  you, by the way. They've also fundamentally invented on star. Like

961
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,240
Speaker 5:  I went to code and I saw GM executives. Like they just invented OnStar and

962
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,480
Speaker 5:  they're like, we had an all hands and we were like, they just invented OnStar,

963
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,320
Speaker 5:  but the eight looks good. I think a lot of people are gonna upgrade it. Same

964
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,520
Speaker 5:  basic chip. Right? Like not a lot of additional features and the eight just

965
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,280
Speaker 5:  big screen. I

966
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,240
Speaker 6:  Think the, the, the period and ovulation tracking is kind of a big

967
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,080
Speaker 6:  deal for them because they've been notoriously super far behind

968
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,520
Speaker 6:  there. Yeah. For years and years and years and years. And this is like one

969
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,960
Speaker 6:  of the biggest, like places in wearable space.

970
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,320
Speaker 5:  Well, the interesting thing though, to, you know, just looking at how they

971
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,120
Speaker 5:  talked about it, you have to wear it while you're asleep. Yes.

972
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,480
Speaker 5:  Which is, you know, they're just gonna have to initiate a new user behavior.

973
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,880
Speaker 5:  Also tempera tracking the risk, kind of like dicey another piece of the Nicole

974
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,960
Speaker 5:  article that you, which is great. So we'll see. They've, it's good that they

975
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,240
Speaker 5:  did it. It's cool. I think a lot of people find it useful. I'm just saying

976
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,720
Speaker 5:  as a person who had a baby, you, if you're trying to make a baby, you, you

977
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,560
Speaker 5:  need to know ahead of time.

978
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,320
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. No, I think, I think it's like, I think this is like, I don't

979
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,280
Speaker 6:  think this is necessarily like gonna be useful. I just think it's like interesting

980
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,200
Speaker 6:  that apple is finally doing it and doing this catch up. Yeah. And I would

981
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,240
Speaker 6:  suspect those temperature sensors are not just gonna be used for this, cuz

982
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,840
Speaker 6:  there's been so much space talk in the wearable space of using temperature

983
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,640
Speaker 6:  sensors to predict illness. And they, FDA

984
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,000
Speaker 6:  will be like, you absolutely cannot say that right now. And so I think that's

985
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,400
Speaker 6:  like series nine or something.

986
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They're they are oceans of peer reviewed studies away from making

987
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,240
Speaker 5:  the claims they want to make. Yeah. Which is again, they're making the claims

988
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:35,600
Speaker 5:  they can,

989
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,280
Speaker 7:  Which is one of the weird things. Like we're, we're used to these companies

990
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,080
Speaker 7:  like massively over promising all the stuff that they can do. And with a

991
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,400
Speaker 7:  lot of this stuff, it's a totally different dance where there's like, there's

992
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,480
Speaker 7:  the stuff. And I've heard this from a lot of wearable companies where they're

993
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,360
Speaker 7:  like, we see things, we can't tell you what they are, but we're

994
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,120
Speaker 7:  very confident about them, but we can't legally say a certain set of words

995
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,920
Speaker 7:  in a row about what things actually do. But if you buy one and it's useful

996
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,680
Speaker 7:  to you for that reason, terrific. And you just come outta that conversation

997
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,200
Speaker 7:  and be like, what

998
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,600
Speaker 6:  That's called government regulation, working as intended. Yeah. Cause

999
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,440
Speaker 6:  it's keeping these companies from over promising because otherwise like apple

1000
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,640
Speaker 6:  would be like, we can predict when the baby is coming and you'd be like,

1001
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:12,880
Speaker 6:  what?

1002
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:17,000
Speaker 7:  A hundred percent. Yeah. We're gonna save your life for sure. Apple

1003
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:17,560
Speaker 7:  a hundred

1004
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,120
Speaker 5:  Percent again. And the fact you have to wear it overnight. Like I am not

1005
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:24,080
Speaker 5:  the right person to review this product, but no. Well I think again, this

1006
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,560
Speaker 5:  is like a reveal, like people are gonna get, here's what we know.

1007
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,760
Speaker 5:  They're gonna sum millions with them. And I think we're gonna very quickly

1008
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,920
Speaker 5:  learn how accurate the thing is. Cause people are gonna talk about it.

1009
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,760
Speaker 5:  So that's the eight, I think people just for those reasons, big screen, big,

1010
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,920
Speaker 5:  big, cheap screen. That's the upgrade. Yep. Everyone's gonna do it. The SES

1011
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,240
Speaker 5:  really boring. They just added color to the back. And now we gotta talk with

1012
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:44,600
Speaker 5:  the ultra.

1013
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:49,080
Speaker 19:  This is apple watch ultra a completely new

1014
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,720
Speaker 19:  design reimagined with extraordinary new capabilities that

1015
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,080
Speaker 19:  expand the ways you can use apple watch.

1016
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:59,200
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna buy an ultra it's $800. Yeah. Why am I buying ultra? I

1017
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,960
Speaker 5:  don't know, like the most extreme sport I do as I throw max in the

1018
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,200
Speaker 5:  pool

1019
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,960
Speaker 6:  For divine was like, he called me and he's like, I'm buying the ultra. He's

1020
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,760
Speaker 6:  like a watch guy. And I was like, you're a watch guy. Why, why do you want

1021
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,400
Speaker 6:  the ultra? And he's like the tooling on it. I was like, I'm hanging up on

1022
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:12,920
Speaker 6:  you right now.

1023
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah, no that's right. It, the buttons are great. The, the digital

1024
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,160
Speaker 5:  crown is finally nerded.

1025
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:19,640
Speaker 7:  It's finally nerded.

1026
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,280
Speaker 5:  It's a whole thing. Like the way to describe the design of this thing is

1027
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,680
Speaker 5:  nerded. There. Isn't another word

1028
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:27,800
Speaker 7:  I will say though. Apple did a pretty good job of this. This thing is enormous.

1029
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:31,800
Speaker 7:  Like do not get it twisted. It is enormous to the point

1030
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,120
Speaker 7:  where like you can, you could see from across the room,

1031
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,400
Speaker 7:  which apple executive had an ultra on versus a different apple watch,

1032
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,960
Speaker 7:  like unbelievably noticeable

1033
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,760
Speaker 5:  At the start of the event, they were all wearing the regular apple watches.

1034
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,720
Speaker 5:  That's right. It was announced. They all put on the big

1035
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,880
Speaker 7:  Watches because it was that noticeable. Like you can, you can run around

1036
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,600
Speaker 7:  with an iPhone 14 and no, one's gonna notice because it's just an iPhone.

1037
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,200
Speaker 7:  Right. Like, but the, the ultra is, it's a big boy, but

1038
00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:00,040
Speaker 7:  it it's pretty light. I will say, like I putting it on. I expected it to

1039
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,000
Speaker 7:  just like my hand to just like go down and make a dent in the floor

1040
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,240
Speaker 7:  based on how big it is. But it's actually like, it felt pretty

1041
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:11,320
Speaker 7:  wearable in that sense. It's still bigger than I want on my wrist. And bigger

1042
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,760
Speaker 7:  than I think a lot of people are gonna want on their wrist. But like, if

1043
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,480
Speaker 7:  you're used to wearing the like dump truck of a garment, watch on your wrist,

1044
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,240
Speaker 7:  like this will actually feel probably better on your wrist than a lot of

1045
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,520
Speaker 7:  those would be my guess. Well,

1046
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,920
Speaker 6:  And I do think it like hits that chart of people who are like

1047
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,760
Speaker 6:  the garment folks and then also the Elis and my friends, folks who like,

1048
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,600
Speaker 6:  just want a big watch. Right? Like big watches have always been a thing they're

1049
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,480
Speaker 6:  very like fashionable for, for most guys. I think it's like, yeah, I

1050
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,240
Speaker 6:  wanna have a 49 millimeter. Totally behemoth on my wrist. Whereas I'm

1051
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,520
Speaker 6:  crying over here saying no, like, but the thing do that,

1052
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,480
Speaker 7:  You bring up the thing I've been wondering about like, right. I mean, it's,

1053
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:52,680
Speaker 7:  it's enormous, but the, that point about like who apple is trying to

1054
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,320
Speaker 7:  go after here, I think is, is exactly right. And is going to be very

1055
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,680
Speaker 7:  complicated and yes, Thomas ER, wrote a really good story for us about this,

1056
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,440
Speaker 7:  about whether apple can do to garment, what it once did to Nokia,

1057
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,640
Speaker 7:  which is basically just like iterated out of existence. Yeah. And

1058
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:10,920
Speaker 7:  what's interesting now is that the ultra basically seems to be

1059
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:14,480
Speaker 7:  from a sort of like hyper adventurer athlete perspective,

1060
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:17,880
Speaker 7:  like a mile wide and an inch deep. Right? Like it does a lot of things. Yeah.

1061
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,440
Speaker 7:  But if you're, it'll, it'll do scuba stuff, but if you like really seriously

1062
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,240
Speaker 7:  scuba, it won't do enough. It it'll do a lot of like mountaineering stuff.

1063
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,920
Speaker 7:  But if you're a really serious Mountaineer Mountaineer one who mountaineers

1064
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,800
Speaker 7:  sure. It won't be enough. And so I think trying

1065
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,400
Speaker 7:  to get this overlap of like, how do you, can it do enough other stuff

1066
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:40,440
Speaker 7:  to make up for the sort of ultra specific stuff it doesn't do

1067
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,760
Speaker 7:  seems to be the pitch apple is trying to make on this one and seems

1068
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:48,000
Speaker 7:  very complicated because in all, each of those little tiny niches are people

1069
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,600
Speaker 7:  willing to spend an awful lot of money, but who have a really high bar for

1070
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,760
Speaker 7:  the features that they want and V song and our team has been writing about

1071
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,640
Speaker 7:  this for weeks that like to try to be all things to all people in this sense

1072
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,920
Speaker 7:  is borderline impossible. Yeah.

1073
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,760
Speaker 5:  It's funny. The only customization on the watch is what band you get it with?

1074
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:07,840
Speaker 5:  Like there's a running band, a mountaineering band and a

1075
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,440
Speaker 5:  scuba band. And it's like, that's, those are your choices. By the way, the

1076
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,360
Speaker 5:  bands are totally interchangeable. The existing bands, I might have horrified

1077
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,320
Speaker 5:  some people, but just like clipping on my like Amazon camera band.

1078
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,920
Speaker 6:  Well, that was a rumor beforehand. Is that it wasn't gonna work with the,

1079
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,360
Speaker 6:  the old

1080
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,400
Speaker 5:  Bands? No, that's totally worked. It was the first thing I did. And they,

1081
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,840
Speaker 5:  everyone was like, stop that. And I was like, no, I'm still doing this, but

1082
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,080
Speaker 5:  the, you know, the scuba thing, apple, isn't making that app. Right. They're

1083
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,960
Speaker 5:  going out to like a dive computer company. Right. And they're letting them

1084
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,280
Speaker 5:  make the app, which is crazy. Right? Like apple, that's usually sort of thing.

1085
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,000
Speaker 5:  Apple just like Sherlock away. But they're like, we actually need the

1086
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,920
Speaker 5:  credibility with this audience that the trusted name is

1087
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,320
Speaker 5:  gonna build this app for this watch. They did not do that with mountaineering

1088
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,080
Speaker 5:  or ultra marathoning or this other stuff. And in fact, the watch when you

1089
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,960
Speaker 5:  use it is basically the same, right. It's big square display. It looks

1090
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,880
Speaker 5:  like it has a really big lip around the display and it basically does

1091
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,560
Speaker 5:  not. Yeah,

1092
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,480
Speaker 7:  No, it, it actually, you almost wanted to have more cause you, you just,

1093
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,960
Speaker 7:  you're it sort of your finger sort of slides off the edge of it in a way

1094
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,160
Speaker 7:  that like, if I'm just running and want to deal with, I actually want it

1095
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,320
Speaker 7:  to sort of trap at the edges. Yeah.

1096
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,920
Speaker 5:  And just like the thing's gonna be out in the world, like you assume the

1097
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,280
Speaker 5:  face is gonna get scratched. If it doesn't have more of a lip, but so like

1098
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,120
Speaker 5:  it, it looks different in person and it plays different in

1099
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,720
Speaker 5:  person than it does on the videos. But the button, the big orange clicky

1100
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,880
Speaker 5:  button is great. Right. And it's customizable, which is a big

1101
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:37,080
Speaker 5:  first for apple can drop you into whatever the thing where you roll the crown.

1102
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,760
Speaker 5:  And it turns to display red. This is neat. Like

1103
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,760
Speaker 5:  I'm sold, I'm done. I'm buying the thing.

1104
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,800
Speaker 6:  Like I saw that and I was like, do I need it? No. Do I want it now?

1105
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,360
Speaker 6:  Yes. Just night mode.

1106
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:52,360
Speaker 5:  But other than that, like the app model is the same. Right? Like it hasn't

1107
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,560
Speaker 5:  gotten more powerful. We can't do more things.

1108
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:57,360
Speaker 7:  There's a new face. That's the there's new watch face. It's

1109
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,160
Speaker 5:  Complicated, new face.

1110
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:01,160
Speaker 7:  There's so much stuff on that. Watch face it's nuts.

1111
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:05,080
Speaker 6:  Does it like, look, feel more expensive than the regular

1112
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,400
Speaker 6:  watch

1113
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:07,240
Speaker 5:  Hundred percent like, cause

1114
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,560
Speaker 6:  I wonder if like maybe that they aren't going after

1115
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:14,800
Speaker 6:  that garment crowd, but they are going after those people who buy

1116
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,680
Speaker 6:  expensive watches and wanna look like have nice expensive watches on their

1117
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,480
Speaker 6:  wrist. And most of them also get like generally

1118
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,680
Speaker 6:  speaking, when you're getting a really expensive watch, it's got a diving

1119
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,400
Speaker 6:  computer on it or it's got like your flight computer

1120
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,360
Speaker 6:  because secretly you're a pilot in 1942. Like

1121
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,400
Speaker 6:  it's, it's got all of that stuff. And I wonder if that's actually the crowd

1122
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,200
Speaker 6:  it's going after instead of people who run a lot in the

1123
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,640
Speaker 6:  wilderness.

1124
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:42,280
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, it looks real fancy

1125
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:44,840
Speaker 5:  and I love it.

1126
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:47,760
Speaker 5:  I dunno what to tell you.

1127
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:50,320
Speaker 6:  You're like, yes. It's for me.

1128
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:53,480
Speaker 5:  It's yeah. I'm gonna buy, I'm gonna pay too much money for this thing and

1129
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,000
Speaker 5:  use one 10th of its, you know what I mean? Use it for, I'm gonna use it for

1130
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,600
Speaker 5:  two factor codes. There you go. The most extreme two factor codes that have

1131
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,760
Speaker 5:  entered been generated by any risk computer in the world,

1132
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,080
Speaker 6:  Climb a mountain, be like,

1133
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,720
Speaker 5:  Yes. Okay. I'm logging into my Gmail and no one else's people,

1134
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,440
Speaker 5:  apple watch ultra,

1135
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:12,920
Speaker 7:  All I could think during the event was how excited you must be, that there

1136
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,680
Speaker 7:  are now bit more speakers so that you can just be running around walkie talking

1137
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,680
Speaker 7:  with Becky all day.

1138
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,080
Speaker 5:  And I said, 80 decibel siren. You can do anything.

1139
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:24,880
Speaker 5:  So yeah. So we have people on our staff that are gonna review this thing

1140
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,280
Speaker 5:  appropriately. Thomas Ricker is one of them V is another.

1141
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:32,800
Speaker 5:  So we'll, we'll, we'll push on it in that front. But like the astonishing

1142
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,760
Speaker 5:  thing to me is that apple has not just across the board here.

1143
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,640
Speaker 5:  Right? They didn't show anything else you could do

1144
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,680
Speaker 5:  with a phone or a watch. Like the apps are all

1145
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,600
Speaker 5:  basically the same. There are the dynamic island is fun, but

1146
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:52,560
Speaker 5:  it's widgets. The cameras are improved, but they're still the same cameras.

1147
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:56,480
Speaker 5:  Like there was not, a lot of here are useful

1148
01:00:57,230 --> 01:01:01,040
Speaker 5:  features. The way that, you know, for years, every

1149
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,840
Speaker 5:  iPhone event has added like meaningful daily interaction features

1150
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:08,760
Speaker 5:  to people. And so even the ultra, I'm sure there, like I said, I'm

1151
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,960
Speaker 5:  by one, I'm not I'm the sucker. Like it looks really cool.

1152
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,960
Speaker 5:  And I'm sure people who are actually ultra marathoners or explorers, apple

1153
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,240
Speaker 5:  juice in the word explorers, which was great. It's like, what if they exploring

1154
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:20,520
Speaker 6:  What is there

1155
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,280
Speaker 5:  Space like on the one hand there's satellites everywhere. And we can see

1156
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,960
Speaker 5:  anything on the other hand explores like old school Magellan is buying this

1157
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,600
Speaker 5:  watch, but it's just like, I'm sure those people are interested in the features,

1158
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,080
Speaker 5:  but they're in a market where they're much more fully featured products.

1159
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So it's just like, I, I'm still waiting on the turn for the watch

1160
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,400
Speaker 5:  where it becomes a risk computer instead of like an ever

1161
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,360
Speaker 5:  larger, more complicated piece of hardware

1162
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,360
Speaker 7:  Design. Same. And we've, I mean, we've talked about this on the show too,

1163
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,760
Speaker 7:  that I think like with more screen, more battery and

1164
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:55,160
Speaker 7:  essentially like more stuff you can do on it as a result,

1165
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:59,040
Speaker 7:  there's more you could do there. And I wonder why

1166
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,160
Speaker 7:  apple is not necessarily pushing on some of that stuff.

1167
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:06,160
Speaker 6:  I feel it's the battery I'm like just straight up. It's the battery. Like

1168
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,120
Speaker 6:  until battery tech changes, they can only fit so much battery in

1169
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,840
Speaker 6:  this thing. In which case, like you have to then have a

1170
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,520
Speaker 6:  processor that doesn't suck enough. Like destroy the battery. Yeah.

1171
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,400
Speaker 5:  I will say the screen is now so big that you can

1172
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:25,000
Speaker 5:  open the keyboard and like kind of type with two

1173
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,440
Speaker 5:  thumbs on it. Almost

1174
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,520
Speaker 7:  The swipey typing kind of works.

1175
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:29,760
Speaker 5:  You

1176
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,120
Speaker 7:  Can, you can swipe type like

1177
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:35,000
Speaker 6:  The writing typing. I do that all the time on mine. I mean it's like short

1178
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,080
Speaker 6:  sentences. I don't,

1179
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,880
Speaker 5:  Oh, that's all Siri for me. And then no one knows what I'm trying to say

1180
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,640
Speaker 5:  to them. Oh yeah.

1181
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:43,440
Speaker 7:  That's a nightmare. And now with iOS 16 and I think probably on watch

1182
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,280
Speaker 7:  last nine, you can dictate emojis. So now you can be running

1183
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,680
Speaker 7:  up a mountain, yelling hard emoji, thumbs up emoji,

1184
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:54,720
Speaker 7:  dead emoji into your watch, which is just a life I'm very ready

1185
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:54,920
Speaker 7:  for.

1186
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,520
Speaker 6:  I'm just gonna be like dancing lady, emoji, dancing, lady emoji,

1187
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,360
Speaker 7:  Plane crash, emoji, bear, emoji, house emoji, plane,

1188
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,160
Speaker 5:  Crash emoji. There's a bear in my plane

1189
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:04,480
Speaker 5:  crash.

1190
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:09,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah, look they're so far ahead of everybody else. Like sun Apache was at

1191
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,320
Speaker 5:  code on stage running a pixel, watch an unannounced pixel watch. He was very,

1192
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:17,160
Speaker 5:  and I was so mad. I wasn't there like, but he was, he wore with white pants

1193
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,440
Speaker 5:  so people would notice it. Right. And I was like, well, the old school blogger

1194
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:24,200
Speaker 5:  me, like runs to get a zoom lens and is like stalking

1195
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,520
Speaker 5:  him backstage. And like all the reporters there, like didn't do it like mark

1196
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,440
Speaker 5:  Erman caught it to his credit. But the, the end gadget in me, like the old

1197
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,360
Speaker 5:  school end gadget in me is like, I'm in the hallway, I've got

1198
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:39,160
Speaker 5:  a 200 millimeter lens. Like student's not leaving here until I have

1199
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:42,520
Speaker 5:  a photo of the pixel watch. But like, you know, you can see what it is.

1200
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,360
Speaker 5:  It's a circular watch. It's gonna have a bunch of Fitbit features in it.

1201
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:50,240
Speaker 5:  And they're they're they are competing with the apple watch

1202
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,000
Speaker 5:  series five. Yeah. Like just a fundamental level. There are three generations

1203
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,600
Speaker 5:  behind apple is and apple. So like it's, these complaints are

1204
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,460
Speaker 5:  minor on the edges, right? Like I wish

1205
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:04,780
Speaker 5:  they would make it more powerful, like, but this is more powerful than anything.

1206
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,340
Speaker 5:  But it's just weird that like, you know, the theme here is like, you're gonna

1207
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:12,140
Speaker 5:  be in a car crash, not look at all of the things you can do with your

1208
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,700
Speaker 5:  phone. Like it's apple is just like starting to assume those things.

1209
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,220
Speaker 5:  And

1210
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,100
Speaker 6:  It's like, what if we also saved your life?

1211
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:21,700
Speaker 5:  Right. They're going to places where they're adding

1212
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:25,460
Speaker 5:  features, where they're, they are themselves even saying,

1213
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,580
Speaker 5:  we hope you never use these features.

1214
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:31,460
Speaker 7:  Well, and it's just like, apple is also sort of simultaneously on

1215
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:35,300
Speaker 7:  this, like reset your relationship with technology. And let's

1216
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,500
Speaker 7:  talk about screen time and focus modes. And like let's help you disconnect

1217
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,780
Speaker 7:  and not feel so reliant on your screens. And it's like, you know, what would

1218
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:45,180
Speaker 7:  help is make those interactions easier on the watch? So I don't even have

1219
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,060
Speaker 7:  to get my phone out at all. I can just like, leave it flip down on the table.

1220
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,380
Speaker 7:  And that's just like, some of that is already in there and you can do it

1221
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,580
Speaker 7:  if you want, but either apple doesn't think it's an interesting selling point

1222
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:58,460
Speaker 7:  for people or it just doesn't have any new ideas about how that

1223
01:04:58,460 --> 01:04:59,140
Speaker 7:  stuff is supposed to work.

1224
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,340
Speaker 5:  All right. We need to take a break. Yes

1225
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:01,620
Speaker 7:  We do.

1226
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:05,060
Speaker 5:  I will quickly. Here's everything you need to about the AirPods pro. They

1227
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:08,100
Speaker 5:  are largely the same. They have a slightly new driver. They have an H two

1228
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,860
Speaker 5:  chip. They are still running Bluetooth and they do not do lossless and they

1229
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,180
Speaker 5:  have a little loop in the case for lanyard.

1230
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,180
Speaker 6:  But they, they, they do two times the noise canceling. What?

1231
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,360
Speaker 6:  That, whatever that means.

1232
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:21,920
Speaker 5:  Well, I think that one is the previous generation. I think that one you can

1233
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,560
Speaker 5:  safely assume

1234
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:26,560
Speaker 7:  I will say I tried them. I spent like five minutes wearing a pair

1235
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:30,720
Speaker 7:  in, in the hands on. And the noise canceling is like good,

1236
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,800
Speaker 7:  but not great. Like all noise canceling. Like it does the job, but it's not

1237
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,520
Speaker 7:  incredible. But the, the pass through continues to amaze me,

1238
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,200
Speaker 7:  like how good it is at passing through. I've used a lot of these

1239
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,320
Speaker 7:  headphones now. And like, that's the one place where apple is just like leaps

1240
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,400
Speaker 7:  and bounces above everybody.

1241
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:48,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. By the way, the, the setup for the hands on, they had people with

1242
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:53,080
Speaker 5:  boxes of AirPods pro. Yeah. Yeah. And then so people would

1243
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,240
Speaker 5:  try them on and then you would like put 'em away and like a fresh one would

1244
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,320
Speaker 5:  be delivered to the room.

1245
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:57,960
Speaker 7:  It's

1246
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,680
Speaker 5:  Wild. Like lots of people with lots of boxes of AirPods

1247
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,960
Speaker 6:  Pro. So what you're saying is there's gonna be a really good opportunity

1248
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,160
Speaker 6:  to buy refurbished AirPods

1249
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,800
Speaker 5:  Pros, just go to the apple store on campus.

1250
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:10,040
Speaker 7:  If you want the AirPods that have been and marque brown Lee's ears, that

1251
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,440
Speaker 7:  is a thing you can probably accomplish

1252
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,360
Speaker 5:  Sell 'em as an NFT. Let's do it all. We'll take the break

1253
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:15,840
Speaker 5:  right back.

1254
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:27,060
Speaker 13:  You know, I wonder do you think that we should all try to spend a

1255
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:29,740
Speaker 13:  little time thinking about a good prank that we could pull?

1256
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:34,660
Speaker 20:  I think it would be a good idea. In fact, if you, if

1257
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,740
Speaker 20:  you turn around right now, you'll see that I'm in the studio.

1258
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:43,580
Speaker 13:  This is love is a podcast about people doing incredible things

1259
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:47,820
Speaker 13:  like a woman who moves across the country to work with her hero

1260
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:51,820
Speaker 13:  prince, a man on his way to dinner, who finds a baby

1261
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:55,420
Speaker 13:  on a subway platform, an entire town in Northern

1262
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:58,620
Speaker 13:  Italy that tries to stay quiet at the same time

1263
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:02,940
Speaker 13:  to protect a rare and beautiful sound. And in one of my

1264
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:07,020
Speaker 13:  favorite episodes, a man puts on enormous fake feat and makes

1265
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:10,740
Speaker 13:  tracks up and down the beach, fooling his neighbors for decades.

1266
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:14,820
Speaker 20:  It's the stuff that makes life worth living.

1267
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,620
Speaker 13:  I'm Phoebe judge, listen to new episodes of this is love

1268
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,580
Speaker 13:  wherever you get your podcasts.

1269
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:32,060
Speaker 5:  Okay? So that was the apple event. Obviously we gotta get all the stuff we

1270
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,580
Speaker 5:  gotta review. We gotta talk about it more. We have to experience the island.

1271
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,580
Speaker 5:  The other thing that happened on the same day was Tim cook came to code along

1272
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,180
Speaker 5:  with Johnny ive and Lauren Powell jobs. And I will just tell you this brief

1273
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:44,180
Speaker 5:  story about what it's like being in the room

1274
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:47,460
Speaker 5:  versus what it's like watching on a stream. And you could have paid to watch

1275
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:51,060
Speaker 5:  a stream Cod virtual tickets. So on stage, very

1276
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:54,820
Speaker 5:  notably Johnny I've sat on one chair with Warren Malcho in the middle

1277
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:58,620
Speaker 5:  and Tim cook sat and another chair. Right? And, and trip MC just had

1278
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:02,460
Speaker 5:  his book after Steve about the differences between those two

1279
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,820
Speaker 5:  was just reported that his contract with his new firm love from

1280
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:10,140
Speaker 5:  is not apple in the room. They all, they

1281
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,820
Speaker 5:  both had like entourages and they did not sit near each other

1282
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:17,760
Speaker 5:  and they did not talk to each other. Oh, wow. I noticed that. And so like,

1283
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,560
Speaker 5:  I'm watching trip. Mickle like clock this cuz he's there.

1284
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:25,280
Speaker 5:  And it was just like a really that part of that dynamic. Like they didn't

1285
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,000
Speaker 5:  really talk to each other. They talked about Steve. They were there to talk

1286
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,720
Speaker 5:  about Steve. And that was very touching. Right? And like, I believe

1287
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:35,920
Speaker 5:  that the value Steve instilled in apple are still present at apple.

1288
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:39,120
Speaker 5:  Just the way that all three of them talked about it and talked about him

1289
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,960
Speaker 5:  and their effect on him. Steve was the first guest at what

1290
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,000
Speaker 5:  was then called all things D with Walton, Kara. And so Kara, this was Kara

1291
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,520
Speaker 5:  Swisher's final code, the last session. And she teared up at the end, which

1292
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,160
Speaker 5:  is remarkable for Kara Swisher. So all that was very poignant.

1293
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,600
Speaker 5:  Then we got to the questions.

1294
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:59,960
Speaker 5:  So I asked a question, which, you know,

1295
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,760
Speaker 5:  you kind of know you're not gonna get answer sometimes, but I was like, look,

1296
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,680
Speaker 5:  you guys all said, Steve would've hated social media and the business they

1297
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,800
Speaker 5:  call these apps all run on your phone. What are you gonna do? People buy

1298
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,160
Speaker 5:  the phones to run Instagram and TikTok. Like if you didn't have Instagram

1299
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,000
Speaker 5:  and TikTok on your phone, like people would buy Android phones. And he is

1300
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,480
Speaker 5:  like, yeah, you know, we have screen time. Like that was basically his answer.

1301
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:22,320
Speaker 5:  Didn't he say, I'm not a TikTok expert. Wasn't that right? So then I asked

1302
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:26,280
Speaker 5:  cuz the theme of code was everyone down the line being like TikTok is

1303
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,000
Speaker 5:  dangerous. Like Scott, like we should ban it math. Softner who's the

1304
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,600
Speaker 5:  CEO of actual Springer, huge media company that UNS political. These are

1305
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:36,160
Speaker 5:  things like it should be ban every democracy. It's just Chinese influence.

1306
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,320
Speaker 5:  He's on the board of Netflix. I think there might be, there might be some

1307
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,600
Speaker 5:  other motive there. You know, Evan Spiegel was on stage right before

1308
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:46,800
Speaker 5:  he was like, we gotta compete with them, but they're under CFIUS review.

1309
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:50,240
Speaker 5:  And like the United States government kicked like this whole thing. And then

1310
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:54,080
Speaker 5:  Tim is like, I'm not a TikTok expert. And Casey Newton is there and he's

1311
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,760
Speaker 5:  like, apple has perfect data about TikTok. Yep.

1312
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,440
Speaker 5:  Right. It's the most popular app on their phone. They can see every purchase

1313
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,800
Speaker 5:  that's made in the app. They get a cut of all those purchases. Like actually

1314
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,680
Speaker 5:  he's definitely a TikTok expert. Like this is the thing that people

1315
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,840
Speaker 5:  are using their phones for apple is, but they don't want to talk about it.

1316
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,800
Speaker 5:  So whatever, but ask the question. Great. Then the quant hunt

1317
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,640
Speaker 5:  who is on the sort of revenue side of Fox media straight

1318
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:23,320
Speaker 5:  up asked about RCS. Not me. Love it. Right. I was like

1319
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,440
Speaker 5:  joking with Alex Heath. Like I should ask about RCS, but like I don't think

1320
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:30,160
Speaker 5:  you'd answer the question, right? Yeah. So I try to ask like earthier question,

1321
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:34,280
Speaker 5:  but anyway, qu asked the question, like, you know, Apple's all about connecting

1322
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,720
Speaker 5:  people and equality and all this stuff. Like why don't you support RCS? My

1323
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,280
Speaker 5:  Android funds are green bubbles. And Tim said, I mean, he,

1324
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:45,400
Speaker 5:  he got like icy. Yeah. He said, I don't hear our

1325
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,280
Speaker 5:  customers saying we should put a lot of energy into it, which is hilarious

1326
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:51,680
Speaker 5:  because no customers ask them to put energy into the dynamic island.

1327
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,400
Speaker 5:  Right? No customers, like, here's what you do, ship bad keyboards for five

1328
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,880
Speaker 5:  years. But this is his answer. Great. And then solo says, well, you know,

1329
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,360
Speaker 5:  but there's videos. I wanna send my mom that she can't get. And he was like,

1330
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:06,200
Speaker 5:  buy your mom an iPhone that was like ice cold. And it was very funny. The,

1331
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,880
Speaker 5:  the room laughed really hard. Like it was funny. It was obviously telling

1332
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,800
Speaker 5:  a joke, but it's where apple is. Right. And like, I will tell you the

1333
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,760
Speaker 5:  story we read about that is neck and neck with the iPhone hands on, right?

1334
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,200
Speaker 5:  Like the interest in green bubbles and blue bubbles is

1335
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:24,000
Speaker 5:  experienced by lots of people. And so apple being like no one wants,

1336
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,480
Speaker 5:  this is actually inaccurate because people are experiencing

1337
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:30,640
Speaker 5:  the reality of some of my friends are green bubbles and some of my friends

1338
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,560
Speaker 5:  are blue bubbles and some of these videos are lower resolution. So there's

1339
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,440
Speaker 5:  a lot of pretending that this isn't important to people by apple, by

1340
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:42,240
Speaker 5:  tech people, RCS is not important. What is important

1341
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,920
Speaker 5:  is communicating with people. What is important is encrypted. End-to-end

1342
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,640
Speaker 5:  encrypted messaging by default on your phone. And like,

1343
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:53,600
Speaker 5:  if you're just gonna exclude a huge portion of phones

1344
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,160
Speaker 5:  from that by default, like you, I think you should account

1345
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,720
Speaker 7:  For it. Well, and I guess I I'm of two minds about this I've because on the

1346
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,280
Speaker 7:  one hand, I think if you're Tim cook, you can accurately

1347
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:07,160
Speaker 7:  say you're more supportive of open

1348
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,360
Speaker 7:  messaging than pretty much any other messaging app. Like WhatsApp doesn't

1349
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,680
Speaker 7:  fall back to SMS. You're just hosed. If you're not using WhatsApp. Right?

1350
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,600
Speaker 7:  Like that just, yeah, that just is what it is. There is no system, there

1351
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,480
Speaker 7:  is no open system inside of WhatsApp. So even the fact that apple like

1352
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:24,600
Speaker 7:  does a crappy job of supporting an open system is like one order

1353
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,080
Speaker 7:  of magnitude, better than most other messaging apps. So on that level. Great.

1354
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:31,960
Speaker 7:  I do think it seems impossible to me that this is not something

1355
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,760
Speaker 7:  users have expressed for exactly the reason you're describing. I think the

1356
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:38,440
Speaker 7:  like green bubble versus blue bubble thing is like

1357
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:41,800
Speaker 7:  as its own thing, totally overblown. Like I actually don't think that matters

1358
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,520
Speaker 7:  that much at all. It's the thing where my messages don't reliably

1359
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,320
Speaker 7:  go through. And when I try to send my wife a picture,

1360
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:53,200
Speaker 7:  it comes through as this teeny tiny little thumbnail sized

1361
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,200
Speaker 7:  thing that looks like crap. And it's like, I don't

1362
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,960
Speaker 7:  care about whether it's RCS or if apple just like does a better

1363
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,600
Speaker 7:  job of supporting MMS. Like the, the underneath part of it

1364
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:08,360
Speaker 7:  is not nearly as interesting as the fact that like the only way I can share

1365
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,560
Speaker 7:  a photo with my wife is to upload it to Google photos. And you should actually,

1366
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,200
Speaker 7:  if you're apple well, but

1367
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,720
Speaker 5:  You could use signal or WhatsApp. Like, but I mean like there is that argument

1368
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,200
Speaker 5:  floating out there.

1369
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,200
Speaker 7:  Sure. But this is, this is my point. Like she doesn't use those things. Like

1370
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:24,240
Speaker 7:  she uses text messaging and, and this should work. Like we have a

1371
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,040
Speaker 7:  standard through which this works and if apple is gonna support it at all,

1372
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,120
Speaker 7:  it should at least do the bare minimum to make it work. Functionally,

1373
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:34,240
Speaker 6:  Tim, Tim cook was being like pretty honest that like when he said, buy

1374
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,120
Speaker 6:  your mom an app, an apple phone, right. He has zero incentive

1375
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:42,440
Speaker 6:  to, to wanna put RCS, why should he make that interconnectivity

1376
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:46,440
Speaker 6:  easier for anyone? Like, why should he, he shouldn't, if, if you're running

1377
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,400
Speaker 6:  a business, there's no reason to do that.

1378
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:52,600
Speaker 5:  And we know from various lawsuits and discovery that they

1379
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,920
Speaker 5:  have thought about putting iMessage in Android and they didn't because the

1380
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,040
Speaker 5:  answer is then people would buy their kids, cheap Android phones instead

1381
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:01,360
Speaker 5:  of giving them their old phones and upgrading, which is exactly just

1382
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:05,600
Speaker 7:  Callous math. It is their main lock in engine. Like it really, really is

1383
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:08,560
Speaker 5:  In the United States. We'll qualify it in the United States. It's definitely

1384
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,480
Speaker 5:  main lock in and they know that teenagers bully each other into buying iPhones

1385
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,720
Speaker 5:  because they have green bubbles. This is a real thing that happens. So yeah,

1386
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,960
Speaker 5:  it's it was a, it was a moment like the whole, the whole Steve jobs thing,

1387
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,680
Speaker 5:  Laurie Powell jobs announced to Steve jobs archive, which you can go to,

1388
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:23,280
Speaker 5:  it's gonna share a bunch of emails and videos of Steve that you maybe haven't

1389
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,640
Speaker 5:  seen before. Like that moment was great. And then it ended with buyer, your

1390
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,480
Speaker 5:  mom and iPhone, which again, it was sharp, but it was still a joke.

1391
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,120
Speaker 5:  But I think it was a very revealing joke.

1392
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:35,600
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's it was hard to come out of that thinking this will ever happen.

1393
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:38,040
Speaker 5:  He was basically like, we're not gonna fucking do RCS. Yeah.

1394
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,080
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like he was, he was pretty clearly like, we're not doing this. Like,

1395
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,160
Speaker 6:  this is a bad line of

1396
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,000
Speaker 5:  Questions, but, but like Amy Klobuchar, like floating around the wings being

1397
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,960
Speaker 5:  like, yeah, you are, you know, she was there. She talked about the whole

1398
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,680
Speaker 5:  thing. So was code. We have lots of coverage of the stuff I'm excited for

1399
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:56,640
Speaker 5:  reviews. I think the dynamic island will reveal itself to us and do

1400
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,120
Speaker 5:  time through usage. I'm excited by this camera. So that's all coming up.

1401
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:04,560
Speaker 5:  We gotta run and we've gone way over here as you people have demanded

1402
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:11,080
