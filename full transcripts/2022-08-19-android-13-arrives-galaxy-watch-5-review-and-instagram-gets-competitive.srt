Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, Alex Cranz, and David Pierce discuss the Android 13 update, the battle between the vertical video apps, and a bunch of gadget news.

2
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,170
Speaker 5:  Hello, and welcome to the vercast flagship podcast of

3
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,490
Speaker 5:  incremental innovation and electron rappers for web apps.

4
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,210
Speaker 5:  Today. We're talking about JavaScript. We're not, we're not gonna do that.

5
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,650
Speaker 5:  I mean, most days we do in a roundabout way, discuss

6
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,290
Speaker 5:  JavaScript, I think, but this is not the show for you. If you're

7
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,730
Speaker 5:  a JavaScript enthusiast, I will tell you that right now, I make no bones

8
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,290
Speaker 5:  about it. Anyway, I'm your friend. Eli. Alex Kranz is here. I'm your friend

9
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,250
Speaker 5:  who just loves Pearl. Very good. It's my favorite. Yeah. You're it's great.

10
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,530
Speaker 5:  You're just doing, you're just doing the command line. You're in there. Yeah.

11
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,010
Speaker 5:  David Pierce

12
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,930
Speaker 6:  Is here. Yeah. I'm definitely your friend who is gonna like give you a long

13
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,810
Speaker 6:  speech about low code and no code. And then try

14
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,690
Speaker 6:  to convince you to optimize all of the apps in your life, to

15
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,010
Speaker 6:  the point where everything immediately breaks. That's my job.

16
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,130
Speaker 5:  My first email client was in a, was in a terminal, like a Unix terminal

17
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,650
Speaker 5:  was pretty good. I missed those days. So it's called pine. I dunno if you

18
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,090
Speaker 5:  remember this, I might be the one old and every now and

19
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,010
Speaker 6:  See like a hacker. Every time you checked your email.

20
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,290
Speaker 5:  Well, no, because it was, it was at school, like in college

21
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,650
Speaker 5:  and they, they just had a bunch of Matt classics at the entryway of the

22
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,370
Speaker 5:  dorm. And everyone stood in a line to log into their, their

23
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,130
Speaker 5:  like shell account to check their email in pine, just cuz we didn't have

24
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,170
Speaker 5:  computers yet typing the I. Then I wrote my steam engine up both

25
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,410
Speaker 5:  ways to college.

26
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,490
Speaker 6:  When you describe that, it sounds like like in, in movies when they show

27
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,650
Speaker 6:  like the line of people in prison waiting to make phone calls, like that's,

28
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,170
Speaker 6:  that's basically what you just described.

29
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,530
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it was, it was a different time. And at no point did we think that

30
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,240
Speaker 5:  democracy would be imperiled by our command line, email

31
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,800
Speaker 5:  clients and things have changed. It's fine. Simpler times

32
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,960
Speaker 5:  here we are now coming to you live over the internet. See it's a thing everything's

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,400
Speaker 5:  are improved democracy in peril. The verge cast, you gotta take the good

34
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,200
Speaker 5:  with the bad. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Lost talking this week,

35
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,320
Speaker 5:  Android 13 came out for pixel phones. A lot of people refreshing eagerly

36
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,760
Speaker 5:  the brewing war between the vertical scrolling video apps

37
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,280
Speaker 5:  is here. A bunch of EV news got a little bit of lightning around. Let's

38
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,240
Speaker 5:  start with Android. We had Samsung reviews this week too. The, the Z fold

39
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,160
Speaker 5:  four, the watch five shout out to the, for an

40
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,560
Speaker 5:  incredible fake out on the watch. Five video review. If you haven't seen,

41
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,920
Speaker 5:  I'm not gonna ruin it for you. But

42
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,280
Speaker 7:  I was like preparing to like, I was writing a DM to her being like, this

43
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,880
Speaker 7:  head is wrong. Why are you saying all of this with this head? You can't do

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,040
Speaker 7:  this.

45
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

46
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,760
Speaker 7:  And then I kept watching. I was like, oh, that's why, that's why they got

47
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:54,880
Speaker 7:  it.

48
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,880
Speaker 5:  It's fine. Yeah. It's good. Go watch it. It's good. But let's start with

49
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,640
Speaker 5:  it. David, Android 13. It feels like it's like a, like an Android,

50
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,040
Speaker 5:  snow leopard. Like they're just getting a lot of stuff, right?

51
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think that's basically right. I mean a, the funny thing about Android

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,120
Speaker 6:  updates is always that it, Android updates come out and Google's like

53
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,760
Speaker 6:  Android 13 is here. 12 of you can download it. Yeah.

54
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,080
Speaker 6:  Cuz it hardly like nobody owns pixels. Mo

55
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,840
Speaker 6:  most people own Android phones that are on somewhere between like last

56
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,040
Speaker 6:  and six versions of Android to go. But Android 13

57
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,640
Speaker 6:  is out for people who want it. It's like it is, it's a snow leopard thing.

58
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,840
Speaker 6:  They're like, they're doing a bunch of little things. This is kind of where

59
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,200
Speaker 6:  we are with smartphones. Right? It's like it's to give you some more control

60
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,200
Speaker 6:  over like how it looks and what kind of access

61
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,520
Speaker 6:  apps can have. And Android, I will say to its credit is doing a really good

62
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Speaker 6:  job of starting to like piece things together. And they're like, you can

63
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,080
Speaker 6:  tell your app what language you want it to run in which photos it should

64
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,040
Speaker 6:  have access to how it should operate all these. Like they're just giving

65
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,160
Speaker 6:  people a lot of knobs to fiddle with, which I actually think like at this

66
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,400
Speaker 6:  moment in smartphones is a really good idea.

67
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We should describe what snow leopard means. Again, I'm an old head

68
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,680
Speaker 5:  steam engine uphill, both ways. All of us

69
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,600
Speaker 7:  Were, was the best snow.

70
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,040
Speaker 5:  Snowbird was the best version of what at the time was called Macs 10.

71
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,920
Speaker 5:  And they just decided to not do new features for a year and just make

72
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,040
Speaker 5:  it good. And then they immediately were like, and now we're back to weird

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,000
Speaker 5:  features and that, but it was per I didn't leave snowbird for

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,760
Speaker 5:  three years. I was like, I don't care what you're adding to this operating

75
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,600
Speaker 5:  system. This one's perfect. And every day that I use

76
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,040
Speaker 5:  this computer, I was like, I missed snow leopard. So that's like we're in

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,720
Speaker 5:  that moment for a lot of software hilariously, the developers of Madden

78
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,920
Speaker 5:  described it this years as a snow leopard release.

79
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,240
Speaker 5:  And it just feels like Android is in that same place where they're adding

80
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,960
Speaker 5:  things like spatial audio because they need to compete with apple. They're

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,840
Speaker 5:  adding things like more personalization maybe cuz they

82
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,880
Speaker 5:  need to compete with apple. But maybe because there's nothing left to do.

83
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,240
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I will say the one thing I find very exciting about Android 13 is

84
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,320
Speaker 6:  like Google's big theme for the world right now is

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,800
Speaker 6:  like putting all of its many pieces together, which we talked about a bunch

86
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,720
Speaker 6:  in the show and like they're trying to make all their apps and services make

87
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
Speaker 6:  more sense together. And so there's this thing now where you can basically

88
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,160
Speaker 6:  stream your messaging apps from your phone to your Chromebook,

89
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,880
Speaker 6:  which I think a is an extremely good idea because like sitting here at my

90
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,320
Speaker 6:  computer and typing on my phone all day to message people is a gigantic pain

91
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,400
Speaker 6:  in the ass that I really am excited for it to go away. But also because it's

92
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,200
Speaker 6:  like, it's just a good idea and that kind of thing where it's like, I should

93
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,440
Speaker 6:  be able to type on my phone from my computer. And that is like how all of

94
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,400
Speaker 6:  this should work. And I like it very much and it feels like that's like the

95
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,600
Speaker 6:  start of something. Very cool. But otherwise all this stuff is like, yeah,

96
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,640
Speaker 6:  these are good things that are not gonna like blow your mind to pieces.

97
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,440
Speaker 7:  Do you think it's like, they just really wanted to hunker down and, and

98
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,680
Speaker 7:  improve on like the stuff they have or was it the

99
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,880
Speaker 7:  pandemic and the development cycles usually take a while and

100
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,580
Speaker 7:  the pandemic kind of screwed up those development cycles or both.

101
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,420
Speaker 5:  I think it's both in like in a serious way. I just, I remember C saying

102
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,340
Speaker 5:  to us on the show, it's kind of the beginning of pandemic. He was like,

103
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,580
Speaker 5:  we're well set up to all work from home and complete our roadmaps. What I'm

104
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,180
Speaker 5:  worried about is the next set of ideas. Yeah. Which think a lot of companies

105
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,900
Speaker 5:  have run into in one way or the other. But I think they were obviously

106
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,620
Speaker 5:  disrupted and no company is really being loud about how, how much its plans

107
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,500
Speaker 5:  were disrupted. But I just also think contextually, if you just look at the

108
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,220
Speaker 5:  state of Android right now at the same time the Android 13 is arriving.

109
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,020
Speaker 5:  We, we have the galaxy Z fold four running Android 12, right? Like

110
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,460
Speaker 5:  the, the new, most complicated fanciest Android smartphone

111
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,580
Speaker 5:  is being released at the same time, running the old version, cuz that's just

112
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,100
Speaker 5:  where Android is. And then they're running this

113
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,740
Speaker 5:  gigantic campaign about RCS because they know

114
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,500
Speaker 5:  that at least in the United States getting people to Levi message and switch

115
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,340
Speaker 5:  to Android is like too hard. So like what is the value of firing dozens

116
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,140
Speaker 5:  of new features into Android at this moment when switching is really

117
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,980
Speaker 5:  hard and your flagship phone provider is just gonna

118
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,500
Speaker 5:  run big speed all day long. Like I think they're in just a tough spot.

119
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,100
Speaker 6:  Well, and I think that comparison is like, it just strikes me

120
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,500
Speaker 6:  as it's behind all of this stuff right now. Right? Like on, on the one hand,

121
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,060
Speaker 6:  the idea that like you can customize the app icons and stuff is like a thing

122
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,100
Speaker 6:  people love on their iPhones that I think Google is very smart to pick up

123
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Speaker 6:  on and sort of keep moving forward. And they're like, we'll automatically

124
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,260
Speaker 6:  change the color scheme of all your icons so that it'll work. But there's

125
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,100
Speaker 6:  also like the, when you ask somebody now like the difference between iOS

126
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,300
Speaker 6:  and Android, they're functionally the same Android actually like has more

127
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,220
Speaker 6:  features most of the time, but iOS just feels better. Like it, it

128
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,060
Speaker 6:  just does. And I think now like Google is

129
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,180
Speaker 6:  pushing really hard on this idea of like, what if we make Android feel better?

130
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,060
Speaker 6:  And, and there's all this little stuff that, that entails. Like I think we

131
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,300
Speaker 6:  were talking on this show about the, the magical thing where you can copy

132
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,080
Speaker 6:  text from one device and paste it onto another with apple. And like now Android

133
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,880
Speaker 6:  does that. Or I guess soon it will do that. If you have two devices

134
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,840
Speaker 6:  that are updated, which you won't, but like you get the idea. But

135
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Speaker 6:  I think like that kind of stuff is like, I think Google is absolutely right

136
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,240
Speaker 6:  to say let's not build insane new stuff that almost no one is going to use.

137
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,080
Speaker 6:  Let's like make Android feel better. Yeah. And I think that is like, that's

138
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,880
Speaker 6:  how you get to where apple is. And then if you can solve RCS, then you might

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,480
Speaker 6:  actually be able to convince people to switch. Do

140
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,400
Speaker 5:  You feel like we've had this conversation every year for the past five years?

141
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,040
Speaker 5:  Because I, I feel like we could just do a clip show about that

142
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,480
Speaker 5:  and just rerun ourselves saying Google is focused. True. Do you remember

143
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,440
Speaker 5:  project butter? This is a company that once announced an entire

144
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,040
Speaker 5:  initiative called project butter that was designed to make

145
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,120
Speaker 5:  Android smoother.

146
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:41,960
Speaker 7:  Oh,

147
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,440
Speaker 6:  Kind of

148
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,160
Speaker 5:  Worked. It worked for a number of reasons. One, I remembered that it was

149
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,440
Speaker 5:  called project butter. Branding achieved two,

150
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,240
Speaker 5:  two, like yes. Android improve. But like, it just feels like that's the gap.

151
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,520
Speaker 5:  And I don't know that Google has meaningfully closed

152
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,120
Speaker 5:  it on these phones and it, then you've just got, well, what is the reality

153
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,720
Speaker 5:  of Android in this country? At least it's all of the Android phones are sold

154
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,600
Speaker 5:  by Samsung. Yes. So then someone else comes in and like does

155
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,320
Speaker 5:  whatever they want with Android. Samsung phones are smooth in their way.

156
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,480
Speaker 5:  It's not that they're not, they're just smooth in like

157
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,360
Speaker 5:  Samsung's way, which is a lot of trying to redirect you into a Samsung

158
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,280
Speaker 5:  lifestyle.

159
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,520
Speaker 7:  Get that big speed.

160
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,720
Speaker 5:  Maybe you are not interested in any way, shape or form or it's like,

161
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,840
Speaker 5:  sure carriers can put apps on this phone. Like there's, there's a different

162
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,040
Speaker 5:  experience to that. That is just more, the business is

163
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,800
Speaker 5:  in your face more with a Samsung Android phone, especially you buy it from

164
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,240
Speaker 5:  one of the major carriers, whereas apple to its credit. It's just like their

165
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,280
Speaker 5:  business is in your face all the time. But like they managed to hide it

166
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,480
Speaker 5:  better.

167
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,800
Speaker 6:  I don't know. Apple is like, and there was some news about this this week

168
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,720
Speaker 6:  that apple is now preparing to put more ads in more of

169
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,760
Speaker 6:  its apps and search results and stuff like that. And it's like, they're kind

170
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,040
Speaker 6:  of creeping towards each other. Right? Like Google is getting a little cleaner

171
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,960
Speaker 6:  and a little simple, simpler. Samsung even has really

172
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,440
Speaker 6:  pulled back over the last couple of years to the point where like, like I

173
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,240
Speaker 6:  used to hate Samsung's UI choices. And my recommendation was always like

174
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,160
Speaker 6:  run away from Samsung software as fast as you can by it's hardware and

175
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,520
Speaker 6:  do some weird stuff and install launchers. And now like Samsung software

176
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,440
Speaker 6:  is good. And it's like, yeah, you're starting to see the business of

177
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,320
Speaker 6:  apple a little more as Android is starting to move, they're just moving towards

178
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,920
Speaker 6:  each other in this really interesting, not necessarily great way all the

179
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,000
Speaker 6:  time.

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,760
Speaker 7:  Well, it's also interesting that Apple's like hardware lineup

181
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,600
Speaker 7:  is getting more fragmented. Whereas like Google's been

182
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,280
Speaker 7:  dealing with fragmentation for a decade now they, they know how to deal with

183
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,000
Speaker 7:  it. And Apple's like, I gotta figure this out. I guess we gotta like slow

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,520
Speaker 7:  down something.

185
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,200
Speaker 6:  You want old software. We got old software.

186
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,760
Speaker 5:  That's pretty generous on Google having figured out. I mean they have in

187
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,240
Speaker 5:  essentially.

188
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,880
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Like they

189
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,440
Speaker 5:  Definitely have these aggregated like place services from Android and they

190
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,000
Speaker 5:  are better at updates and they've signed more aggressive deals to force the

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,520
Speaker 5:  updates to, to happen. But really the solution to Android

192
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,680
Speaker 5:  fragmentation is that Samsung won the market. Yeah. And so like,

193
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,520
Speaker 5:  it's not that fragmented.

194
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,560
Speaker 7:  Right. But like they've, they've had to deal with the challenge and like,

195
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,520
Speaker 7:  think about that challenge in a way that apple really hasn't had to like

196
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,440
Speaker 7:  ever in its phone market. Right. Like Apple's never had to think about fragmentation

197
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,640
Speaker 7:  and now it's got what, six different screens or something that it's got.

198
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And then they're, they're gonna delay iPad OS or so we have heard

199
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,560
Speaker 5:  by the way, rumors that I iPhone event or some event,

200
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,240
Speaker 5:  we're assuming iPhone's usually in September or first part of

201
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,000
Speaker 5:  September, it's

202
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,920
Speaker 7:  Gonna be a home pod event.

203
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah. September 7th, I think is the date. Mark Garman reported all

204
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,360
Speaker 7:  Home pods and apple TVs get excited.

205
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,880
Speaker 5:  If it's, I mean, I would go to that event with Bellson. I would literally

206
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,840
Speaker 5:  like I'm here. I'm the most plugged in person

207
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,240
Speaker 5:  in this event. Let's talk apple TV the whole time. No one else three hit

208
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,920
Speaker 5:  me, Craig. And it would just be me like alone in the field,

209
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,760
Speaker 5:  looking at the giant screen, being like, come on, did you make a TV?

210
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,880
Speaker 5:  I'd be like, and then it's just Tim cook, come on stage and be like, no,

211
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,040
Speaker 5:  no. And he leaves hi. I would go to that event. Like it's time to

212
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,000
Speaker 5:  change events. What if instead of holding product launches, they just get

213
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,720
Speaker 5:  one person who wants something really badly. And then the CEO of the company

214
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,880
Speaker 5:  just denies that person. What they want. It's really close to the mic. We

215
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,360
Speaker 5:  get more coverage.

216
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Tech company's disappointing one person at a time. That's our new event

217
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,800
Speaker 5:  strategy. I think it'll go really well. Speaking of Samsung

218
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,760
Speaker 5:  phones reviews are hitting. So Allison reviewed

219
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,480
Speaker 5:  the Z fold four V reviewed the galaxy watch five, let's start with the Z

220
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,280
Speaker 5:  fold four. Allison's like pretty into this phone. It's very expensive.

221
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,720
Speaker 5:  But she's like, this is the most gadgety gadget you can get. And you

222
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,040
Speaker 5:  won't be disappointed with it. The camera is improved. The Android

223
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,000
Speaker 5:  tablet ecosystem is still whatever it is. But I think we were saying this

224
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,720
Speaker 5:  last week, like they've just arrived at a they've iterated their way to a

225
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,680
Speaker 5:  workable folding phone.

226
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,600
Speaker 6:  I think the camera thing is super exciting here, actually, cuz that has been,

227
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,520
Speaker 6:  cuz you like, if you're gonna buy a fold, you kind of get into the fold,

228
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,120
Speaker 6:  knowing what you're getting into, right? Like it's gonna be a little more

229
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,160
Speaker 6:  fragile. It's gonna be a little bigger. So you're like, it's very hard to

230
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Speaker 6:  buy that phone and not sort of understand those trade offs, but the idea

231
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,800
Speaker 6:  that you're spending all this money and getting a worse phone than Samsung's

232
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,400
Speaker 6:  other or, or worse cameras rather than Samsung's other high end phones

233
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,800
Speaker 6:  sucks. But now like you kind of get the feeling that like Samsung

234
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,040
Speaker 6:  now has sort of done all that it can. Right? And it's, it's still

235
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,400
Speaker 6:  a little big, it's still a little fragile, but like that just is

236
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,640
Speaker 6:  where we are in like science and materials.

237
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,560
Speaker 6:  Chemistry, Android app are still bad for

238
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,400
Speaker 6:  big screens. You just can't get good tablet apps for most Android apps.

239
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But otherwise Samsung's kind of put in its best feet forward

240
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,360
Speaker 6:  here, which I find super exciting. It's still $1,800, but it's like, it's

241
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,440
Speaker 6:  a very good phone that also turns into a tablet. And that's like about all

242
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,280
Speaker 6:  you can ask for right now.

243
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,040
Speaker 7:  I like how thorough Allison was in this review. Like she tested the flex

244
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,200
Speaker 7:  mode. She did it. She put it in this stupid. She did it.

245
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,000
Speaker 5:  She put, she heard us talking about tent mode on the show. She's like, all

246
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,560
Speaker 5:  right. The people demand 10 mode. The

247
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,290
Speaker 7:  People, my bosses demand. Then I test it in

248
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,450
Speaker 7:  flexible. I don't think that's what happened. That's not what happened. Listens

249
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:19,570
Speaker 7:  the

250
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:19,690
Speaker 5:  Show.

251
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,490
Speaker 5:  No she's in it. I mean like the Samsung has done a number of things with

252
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,090
Speaker 5:  this phone that are legitimately the future of phones, right? Yeah.

253
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,970
Speaker 5:  Folding or not. Right? Yep. The huge pixel bend sensor

254
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,090
Speaker 5:  has been the future for a minute, but they've refined it to a place where

255
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,050
Speaker 5:  it works really well. The under display camera is still a little weird,

256
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,770
Speaker 5:  but it works really well. Like I don't,

257
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,090
Speaker 6:  It works pretty well. Allison's description of it was very funny to me. She

258
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:50,170
Speaker 6:  described it as the, the visual aura that you get right before you get a

259
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,810
Speaker 6:  migraine headache, which is like not what you wanna hear from your selfie

260
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,770
Speaker 6:  camera. But as an under screen camera is like, it, she kinda landed on

261
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,410
Speaker 6:  like, it does the job, right? Like it's fine. And there are also 40,000 other

262
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,970
Speaker 6:  cameras on this thing that you can turn towards you in various ways. So it'll

263
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,530
Speaker 6:  be fine. But yeah, I agree. That's the kind of thing that like give it a

264
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,010
Speaker 6:  couple years and that's what all front facing cameras are gonna look like.

265
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,930
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And Samsung thing is just historically good at

266
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,770
Speaker 5:  throwing things at the wall and then slowly iterating them into

267
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,970
Speaker 5:  until apple steals them and pretends they invented them and like,

268
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,130
Speaker 5:  you know, it's true. And like, I just think this, this

269
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,930
Speaker 5:  phone four versions in is I

270
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,290
Speaker 5:  keep saying this, I don't know. I don't even know if it's true anymore because

271
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,690
Speaker 5:  the software and ecosystem lock-ins are so hard. But if you just want like

272
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,530
Speaker 5:  a new gadget, I can't think of a better gadget at this point in

273
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,410
Speaker 5:  time. And I I've been saying things like phones are the worst gadgets

274
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,290
Speaker 5:  for like five years, like go buy a new TV or upgrade your

275
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,370
Speaker 5:  sound bar. Like that'll make you happy. And then we're looking at all of

276
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,090
Speaker 5:  the sales from all those companies. And it's like, oh, everyone did that

277
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,410
Speaker 5:  already. All it's time to find a new category gadgets. It's like, it's folding

278
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,690
Speaker 5:  phones. Like they're here at the right time. You think

279
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,370
Speaker 7:  It's you think it's folding phones and not like the steam deck and those

280
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,210
Speaker 7:  kind of like little game consoles.

281
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,010
Speaker 5:  I mean, I know how you and Sean feel

282
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,410
Speaker 7:  ING. Yeah. We're Sean, get 'em on, get 'em on the line. Liam.

283
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,850
Speaker 6:  Can you pair Nintendo's Joycons to the fold four cuz

284
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,890
Speaker 6:  there, there it is. There's your magical gadget

285
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,850
Speaker 7:  And then like just get a 3d print, a little case for it, slot

286
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,170
Speaker 7:  it in, make your own switch.

287
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,370
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think the steam deck is a great

288
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,050
Speaker 7:  GA. I actually have something I need to go do. Sorry. Gotta go do this.

289
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,850
Speaker 7:  Somebody get me a 3d printer.

290
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,650
Speaker 5:  Well, I, I think the steam deck is like a great category of GA. I, I,

291
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,730
Speaker 5:  I'm not disagreeing with you. Yeah. I just think it's one of those gadgets

292
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,570
Speaker 5:  where you can screw with it. But at some point you, the gadget playing with

293
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,090
Speaker 5:  the gadget element of it recedes because you just end up playing a video

294
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:43,330
Speaker 5:  game.

295
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,090
Speaker 6:  Right. Yep.

296
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,170
Speaker 5:  Which is great and fine and fair. But if you're in gadgets for the

297
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,000
Speaker 5:  messing, with the gadget element of it, I think the fold is a superior

298
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,960
Speaker 5:  gadget. Does that make any sense? Yes.

299
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think that's probably right.

300
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,080
Speaker 7:  I mean, I disagree.

301
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,640
Speaker 6:  It also just gives you more to do like,

302
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,360
Speaker 5:  But, but like at the end of the day with any, any game console yeah. The

303
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,120
Speaker 5:  point is to play video games. Right.

304
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,160
Speaker 7:  That's true,

305
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,800
Speaker 5:  Sean. And the point is to like buy steam deck accessories and then augment

306
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,360
Speaker 5:  the steam deck into a full laptop and then run the version

307
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,480
Speaker 7:  Steam deck. I want my steam deck to like run pie hole, like turn it into

308
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,280
Speaker 7:  a little server, just have it, do all the things like

309
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,800
Speaker 7:  everything. Like there's just so many weird things I can do with it and just

310
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,960
Speaker 7:  mess around with it. And I think it's probably the Linux of it that makes

311
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,840
Speaker 7:  it like Supreme gadget for me. Cause I'm like, it's got Linux. I can

312
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,360
Speaker 7:  just get into Linux. I can just get into the command line. And I can't do

313
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,280
Speaker 7:  that with, with this phone, but also I appreciate that. I can take this

314
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,160
Speaker 7:  phone on a plane and like mess with it as a gadget. And I could

315
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,240
Speaker 7:  not do that with the steam deck. I would just play video games with the steam

316
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,320
Speaker 7:  deck or I would accidentally break it. Those are my, those are my two.

317
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,640
Speaker 6:  I would also point out that I think you could buy all three

318
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,280
Speaker 6:  skews of the steam deck for less than

319
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,680
Speaker 5:  Four costs. Fair enough.

320
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,600
Speaker 5:  I mean, what is the,

321
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,520
Speaker 6:  I agree like I think, and I wrote about this when they announced the, the

322
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,480
Speaker 6:  Z fold for like, I think the thing no one has done is make like

323
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,760
Speaker 6:  the case for why this thing needs to exist. And to some extent, this is like

324
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,840
Speaker 6:  the, the like ongoing question about the iPad is like, why do you need an

325
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,480
Speaker 6:  iPad? And it's like, once you have one, you like kind of get why it's useful,

326
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,200
Speaker 6:  but there's no, if you were like, I have a laptop and a phone, why should

327
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,840
Speaker 6:  I buy an iPad? Like, it's kind of a hard question to answer. And I think

328
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,720
Speaker 6:  the same is true for this. It's like, it's cool to have

329
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,480
Speaker 6:  this big screens are good. You can watch videos dancing for

330
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,240
Speaker 6:  won't shut up about watching all of the halo TV show in bed, on his fold.

331
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,960
Speaker 6:  Like that's all great, but there's no,

332
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,800
Speaker 6:  there's no reason I would like tell you to go out of your way

333
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,840
Speaker 6:  and spend, you know, seven or 800 extra dollars to buy this phone. But if

334
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,720
Speaker 6:  you do, and it's a thing you want, it does feel like infinitely fun

335
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,680
Speaker 6:  to play with in a way that most phones are not fun to play with right now.

336
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,120
Speaker 6:  And this goes back to the Android thing, right? They're just like they're

337
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,960
Speaker 6:  tuning and tweaking and touching. And Samsung is out here just being like,

338
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,800
Speaker 6:  we have some new ideas. We don't really know what they are, but let's see

339
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,760
Speaker 6:  what happens. I'm

340
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,280
Speaker 5:  Like kudos. I will say that after we talked to the Z flip last week,

341
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,720
Speaker 5:  the number of people who hit us up to say that they see flips in the wild,

342
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,160
Speaker 5:  oh, my is very high. Our thesis is correct.

343
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,400
Speaker 6:  I got on a train like three hours after we recorded. And the two

344
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,120
Speaker 6:  people sitting closest to me, both had Z

345
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,760
Speaker 6:  flips. It blew my, it was like a sign from the universe that was like, David

346
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,160
Speaker 6:  people use these phones.

347
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,280
Speaker 5:  I

348
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,560
Speaker 6:  Hear you

349
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,360
Speaker 5:  Understand were like, I've heard about this move called the scroll and flip.

350
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,440
Speaker 5:  And I want you to take it very seriously. I thought everyone, can I see your

351
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,240
Speaker 5:  phone? Yeah, we got a Z flip review yet to come. I think

352
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,000
Speaker 5:  that is an important one, but it's start the watch for a quick second.

353
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,560
Speaker 5:  So watch five is out. Like I said, you gotta just watch the video cuz it's

354
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,320
Speaker 5:  an incredible fake out from V but it seems like the

355
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,600
Speaker 5:  grand Samsung, Google wears

356
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,960
Speaker 5:  experiment is off to an extremely medium start.

357
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,240
Speaker 7:  Yes. That seems accurate. Yeah. Like medium. Yeah.

358
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,520
Speaker 7:  She, she didn't hate this watch. Like she didn't outright hate it,

359
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,320
Speaker 7:  but it's still all the promise is not there. They have not delivered

360
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,560
Speaker 7:  on the big whizbang promises of this collaboration instead.

361
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,160
Speaker 7:  They've done like, well and there's nice things. There's

362
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,920
Speaker 6:  Just a bunch of like really basic stuff that it's like, like I, I, I have

363
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,640
Speaker 6:  made the case for years and continue to believe strongly that truly the

364
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,640
Speaker 6:  only thing that matters is battery life. Yes. Like you, you can, you can

365
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,520
Speaker 6:  add all the stuff you want after you give me a battery that is going to last

366
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,560
Speaker 6:  ideally days, but at least the whole day without ever

367
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,400
Speaker 6:  having to worry about it. And like the fact that Samsung is still

368
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,800
Speaker 6:  not, there is a, is a real bummer and a big problem, I think.

369
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And also, I mean, the fact that they haven't really changed the design

370
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,920
Speaker 5:  at all, like I think she said the only, only way you can tell the difference

371
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,680
Speaker 5:  between these two is the strap colors.

372
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,160
Speaker 7:  That's not great. Sure.

373
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,960
Speaker 5:  The purple's

374
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,520
Speaker 6:  Nice. I like

375
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,840
Speaker 5:  The purple. The purple's nice. It looks pretty. I saw it in the office the

376
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,520
Speaker 5:  other day when we were there, it looks very pretty. I miss the physical

377
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,120
Speaker 5:  bezzle. What are you gonna do? But I there's just this

378
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,280
Speaker 5:  moment for the Android ecosystem where like everything is

379
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,120
Speaker 5:  a two-thirds approach to where apple is and is going, like

380
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,200
Speaker 5:  we are expecting in September or October or whenever these apple events

381
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,120
Speaker 5:  are like a huge next generation of, of smart watches from apple. Right? The

382
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,440
Speaker 5:  big outdoor watch the competitor to garment. Yeah. The big update

383
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,600
Speaker 5:  Apple's chip lead is enabling better battery life. Now this

384
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,640
Speaker 5:  size, if they put out a bigger watch, they can shove a bigger battery in

385
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,440
Speaker 5:  there that lead just seems like it's getting bigger, not smaller.

386
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,360
Speaker 7:  I think you're a hundred percent. Right. I think that's right. And but I

387
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,400
Speaker 7:  do wonder like how much Google actually cares

388
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,160
Speaker 7:  because they, they,

389
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Speaker 5:  I mean, I think they care a lot

390
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,440
Speaker 7:  Then why do they suck so much?

391
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,000
Speaker 7:  Like, yeah. I struggle to think if they really care,

392
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,880
Speaker 7:  they put, put a

393
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,480
Speaker 6:  Resource. That's such a good question to ask Google

394
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,560
Speaker 5:  About, about so many things.

395
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,080
Speaker 7:  Oh, you care. Why do you suck?

396
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,160
Speaker 5:  This is seriously when max like throws a tantrum or like max and you

397
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,040
Speaker 5:  come down and she's like, I'm trying. And it's very adorable. And I

398
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,560
Speaker 5:  appreciate it, but it's like, but you actually have to do.

399
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,520
Speaker 7:  Yeah, you gotta do it. That's a point.

400
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,160
Speaker 7:  Feels like a child, but you

401
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,120
Speaker 5:  Know, no, that's the big Google wait. No, that's the big Google trick. Yeah.

402
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,760
Speaker 5:  Google named itself Google. And it put a bunch of colors in its logo. And

403
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,840
Speaker 5:  we think that it's a kindergarten and it's actually like the most ruthless

404
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,440
Speaker 5:  company that you can think of. But because it's called Google, everyone's

405
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,880
Speaker 5:  like, ah, Google. And it's like in the background, like, and we're knifing

406
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,520
Speaker 5:  you like, yeah. But like, like I, they know what they're doing. They know

407
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,360
Speaker 5:  how they make their money. They write like searches a huge business for them.

408
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,040
Speaker 5:  YouTube is a huge business for them. They are very good at running those

409
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,760
Speaker 5:  businesses. It's here where they're not in control of their

410
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,520
Speaker 5:  ecosystem, that they struggle to find a compelling narrative

411
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,880
Speaker 5:  or they struggle to do things like buy HTC and turn the

412
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,840
Speaker 5:  pixel into a competitor's Samsung. And I think, I know, I know they care.

413
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,800
Speaker 5:  We know lots and lots of Google people. Right. We know one very well in particular.

414
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,360
Speaker 5:  I know they care a lot, but it's, I don't think they have the

415
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,240
Speaker 5:  moves. Like I don't think they can directly produce the

416
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,960
Speaker 5:  products like we, maybe they, you know, they've got the pixel, they've announced

417
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,520
Speaker 5:  that there's a pixel watch coming. Maybe those things when they actually

418
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,440
Speaker 5:  take control of their ecosystem will become these competitors. But

419
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,360
Speaker 5:  here where they sign this big deal with Samsung to do wear OS on this watch,

420
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,640
Speaker 5:  like their, their ability to execute like ends. And then Samsung has to take

421
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,520
Speaker 5:  the ball and keep running. And Samsung is not a bad hardware company. We

422
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,360
Speaker 5:  just talked about this phone, like the Z the fold is don't

423
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,040
Speaker 7:  Do this stuff. I mean, I think Samsung is part of the problem.

424
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,640
Speaker 5:  It's like, for some reason in this category, no one

425
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,920
Speaker 7:  Can go. Yeah. I think, I think Samsung is part of the problem because they

426
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,440
Speaker 7:  historically spent years thinking like very much

427
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,960
Speaker 7:  gendering their wearables and being like fitness bands are for ladies

428
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,120
Speaker 7:  and smartwatches are for boys and isn't it qua and cute.

429
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,520
Speaker 7:  And so there's a lot of catch up there that they have to figure out. And

430
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,480
Speaker 7:  there's a lot of like just their design philosophy has to catch

431
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,280
Speaker 7:  up and actually consider apple and not just chase

432
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,160
Speaker 7:  like the ghost Fitbit from six years ago.

433
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,800
Speaker 6:  But it's also the thing I would add to that is Google keeps making the mistake

434
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,160
Speaker 6:  of having an unbelievably short attention span on all of this stuff.

435
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,800
Speaker 6:  And like the thing, like to your point about apple, Silicon ne like that

436
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,760
Speaker 6:  is a long term project that is like really only coming

437
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,520
Speaker 6:  to fruition for apple now. And they've been investing in that forever.

438
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,960
Speaker 6:  And the idea that Google is just gonna decide

439
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:43,000
Speaker 6:  every six months, whether or not to care about making its own chips

440
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,920
Speaker 6:  or smartwatches or to CA like, it just can't make up its mind

441
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,920
Speaker 6:  long enough to get good at this stuff. And so we're basically back at

442
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,880
Speaker 6:  like the first and second versions of these things, even though it feels

443
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,160
Speaker 6:  like they've tried them a million times before. So like my expectations for

444
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,320
Speaker 6:  the pixel watch are super low because this is functionally like the first

445
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,320
Speaker 6:  ever Google smart watch, even though it isn't, but it's like, you, you

446
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Speaker 6:  don't, at least from what I've seen in a lot of this product development,

447
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,920
Speaker 6:  like you, you can't start stop and then pick up where you left off. Like

448
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,520
Speaker 6:  it actually doesn't work like that. You end up effectively starting over

449
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,240
Speaker 6:  every time. And so Google just keeps shooting itself in the foot here.

450
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, that's true. I think most, most clearly in

451
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,840
Speaker 5:  tablets, right? Where yes, apple spent however

452
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,720
Speaker 5:  long just insisting that the iPad was the future of all

453
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,560
Speaker 5:  computing. And then to slowly realize that

454
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,280
Speaker 5:  people like their laptops and turn the iPad into an

455
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,200
Speaker 5:  expensive laptop. Sure. But they kept at it. Right. They were like, this

456
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,160
Speaker 5:  is what we're doing. We've made this bet. We're gonna keep going with it.

457
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,840
Speaker 5:  It helps some people bought a lot of iPads along the way, but Google made

458
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,480
Speaker 5:  the same bet made the same noise. I was there at CES when they announced

459
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,120
Speaker 5:  Android honeycomb on the Motorola ZY board or whatever

460
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,040
Speaker 5:  it was called. Like I've, we lived through it all together

461
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,800
Speaker 5:  as a family. And then they dropped it. They're like, no one's buying these.

462
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,640
Speaker 5:  No one cares like goodbye. And they let Motorola and Lenovo and Samsung keep

463
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,600
Speaker 5:  putting out $200 Android tablets, mostly for people

464
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,720
Speaker 5:  to use as other content consumption devices or for people to give to their

465
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,280
Speaker 5:  kids. Right. Like that became that market. Like here's a thing you can break.

466
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,760
Speaker 5:  And then they realized that foldables were gonna be big literally.

467
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,280
Speaker 5:  And they're like, we gotta be good at tablets together. They've announced

468
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,480
Speaker 5:  a new tablet project. And it said, well, if you just kept your eye on the

469
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,200
Speaker 5:  ball and made some incremental improvements, you'd be way farther ahead

470
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:32,520
Speaker 5:  than where you are right now. And like, I don't know if that's quite as true

471
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,080
Speaker 5:  with watches, but I do know that they keep they've now bought

472
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,400
Speaker 5:  big companies that are theoretically good at these products. They bought

473
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,440
Speaker 5:  HTC to make pixel phones. They bought Fitbit to make wearables. And we just

474
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,920
Speaker 5:  haven't seen the results. And maybe that's because HTC was not

475
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,080
Speaker 5:  competitive. That that was not competitive. And

476
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,000
Speaker 7:  I mean, because they don't care, like it's a huge company, this

477
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,000
Speaker 7:  isn't their primary space. Like, as we said, it's YouTube, it's

478
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,320
Speaker 7:  it's ads. This is a

479
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,320
Speaker 5:  It's YouTube and search.

480
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,200
Speaker 7:  Yeah. This is like, this is very much like a side project for them. And

481
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,640
Speaker 7:  until it really shows, returns and shows a reason for investment, it's never

482
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,360
Speaker 7:  gonna be an investment, but it ends up being that chicken and egg scenario,

483
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,080
Speaker 7:  cuz it's like, well, you never invested it. So it can never be really successful.

484
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,960
Speaker 7:  Well, yeah. But if it was successful, we'd invested it and it's like, oh,

485
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,560
Speaker 7:  all right. So we're just gonna argue with each other and, and fart out another,

486
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:20,840
Speaker 7:  like

487
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,840
Speaker 5:  Sometimes they get a real window into your previous career

488
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,280
Speaker 5:  at a different media company. I'm not gonna say which one

489
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,000
Speaker 6:  Who's to say who's to say, but no, I think that's right. And I think the

490
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,680
Speaker 6:  other thing is, and we should stop talking about this here in a minute, but

491
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,280
Speaker 6:  I think Google has also been a terrible steward

492
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,480
Speaker 6:  of its ecosystem in this sense, right? Like Google has never, for one

493
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,360
Speaker 6:  minute, given any Android developer a reason to think, oh, I

494
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,960
Speaker 6:  should really invest in my where OS app, because where OS

495
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,440
Speaker 6:  basically like ceases to exist once every two years and then

496
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,520
Speaker 6:  comes back as if by magic three years later. And it's the same with large

497
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,440
Speaker 6:  screens. And like apple just relentlessly told developers for like a

498
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,200
Speaker 6:  decade tablet, apps, matter, tablet, apps matter, tablet, apps matter. And

499
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,080
Speaker 6:  then they eventually got all got on board and now apple has this amazing

500
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,120
Speaker 6:  ecosystem of tablet apps that Google has just never given people

501
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,880
Speaker 6:  a reason to care about. And so when it decides to care, it has to like scramble

502
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,120
Speaker 6:  for six months to try and get everybody on board. And then a year later decides

503
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,600
Speaker 6:  it doesn't care again. I don't know.

504
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I, I mean, I would say that I'm not sure that apple made the,

505
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:30,000
Speaker 5:  I'm not sure that apple finished the turn with the watch and apps,

506
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:30,960
Speaker 5:  right?

507
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,720
Speaker 6:  Like that's fair.

508
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah. In many ways, apps on the watch are still,

509
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,190
Speaker 5:  it's better. Now this is too reductive. I understand that I'm making an

510
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,120
Speaker 5:  UN sort of unfair reductive comment here, but

511
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,360
Speaker 5:  in many ways, apps on the watch are still just remote controls of your

512
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,720
Speaker 5:  phone. Yes, yes. Or extensions of your phone in some other important way.

513
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,400
Speaker 5:  There's, there's, there's a few that are great standalone watch experiences,

514
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,320
Speaker 5:  but like very few and they're very targeted and on the iPad, it's,

515
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,920
Speaker 5:  you know, some of them are great. Some of the really, really great iPad apps,

516
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,040
Speaker 5:  but then you look at the disparity in the iPad line

517
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,760
Speaker 5:  between the, you know, $329 iPad and the pro. And it's

518
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,920
Speaker 5:  like, yep. Some of those apps are designed for this market and a lot. And

519
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,120
Speaker 5:  the iPad is a lot of content in some bottom. And it just, the fact that I

520
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,360
Speaker 5:  can describe that. And a lot of people listen to this, understand what I'm

521
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,840
Speaker 5:  talking about is a victory for apple, right? Even if what I'm describing

522
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,840
Speaker 5:  is not a victory in the context of its own application ecosystem or

523
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,880
Speaker 5:  where it got to with developers or replacing the Mac or all this other stuff,

524
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:34,040
Speaker 5:  it's a victory that there's enough stuff that I can describe how that breaks

525
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,480
Speaker 5:  down. Whereas I don't know that I can describe to you a single wear a Wes

526
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,120
Speaker 5:  app. That is anything but I remote control of the phone, or even describe

527
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,840
Speaker 5:  a single where app. And I think that's like the problem with

528
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,000
Speaker 5:  Google's like ecosystem. It's a problem, honestly, with the watch five beyond

529
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,760
Speaker 5:  it's like battery life. It's that it's more of an,

530
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:56,000
Speaker 5:  it's like a feature phone, a feature watch more than it is like

531
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,400
Speaker 5:  a smart watch. That's an old debate, right? Like, is this a true

532
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,360
Speaker 5:  computing? What is a computer? Is this watch a computer? Or is it just a

533
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,280
Speaker 5:  really, really fancy calculator? Watch, it's a feature phone on

534
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,640
Speaker 5:  your wrist. There's someone out there right now, freaking out me that the

535
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,920
Speaker 5:  first generation iPhone was just the feature phone. Cuz it couldn't run an

536
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,600
Speaker 5:  open application, the ecosystem. And I want you to know that I love you.

537
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,000
Speaker 5:  Aw. You're my people.

538
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,920
Speaker 6:  Yeah. We, we all agree with that.

539
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,800
Speaker 5:  Sweet. Alright. We should take a break. We gotta come back. We gotta

540
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,560
Speaker 5:  talk about the war brewing between vertical video editors. It's a real one

541
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,000
Speaker 5:  top. We'll be right back.

542
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,620
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back. We've labeled this segment. Toto

543
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,380
Speaker 5:  Graham. It's

544
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,740
Speaker 7:  Beautiful.

545
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,260
Speaker 5:  David, what does that mean in your mind?

546
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,700
Speaker 6:  So we've come to this beautiful place where all the apps are the

547
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,540
Speaker 6:  same. There is just only, there is one app and it is, it is a,

548
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,900
Speaker 6:  it is a full screen, vertical video on your phone and where it comes from

549
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,140
Speaker 6:  and what you do there. And what it is, is not important. It

550
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,900
Speaker 6:  is it's your phone is just called app now and you open it and it plays video

551
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,540
Speaker 6:  for you and you swipe vertically and that's all that happens. This is the

552
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,820
Speaker 6:  world that we have somehow come to

553
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,140
Speaker 5:  App. I love app. It's

554
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,620
Speaker 6:  Just called app

555
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,740
Speaker 7:  App apps. Hugely.

556
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,380
Speaker 6:  You like to look at app for five hours and I'm like, yes, I would. Thank

557
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:36,540
Speaker 6:  you.

558
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:40,820
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And the, and the app is like, where, where does, where do the videos

559
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,340
Speaker 5:  come from? I don't know. It's just anywhere.

560
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,500
Speaker 6:  Anything, what do you like dances? And I'm like, yeah, sure.

561
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,220
Speaker 7:  I likes app is I feel like all the subapp really want you to know where the

562
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,620
Speaker 7:  apps videos come from.

563
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,140
Speaker 6:  Oh, it's so important to them. It's

564
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,740
Speaker 5:  Very important. So we should point out just a plug land of the

565
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,780
Speaker 5:  giants this week is Alex talking about the future of Facebook

566
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,740
Speaker 5:  and the discovery engine and the future of the news feed, which is basically

567
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,500
Speaker 5:  Facebook turning Facebook into app,

568
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,900
Speaker 5:  but they're calling the discovery engine.

569
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,340
Speaker 5:  It's a good plug. It's a good episode. You should listen to it. So here's

570
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,860
Speaker 5:  the thing about app

571
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,840
Speaker 5:  TikTok specifically, TikTok, if you just zoom back what

572
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,480
Speaker 5:  TikTok is, is not so much the experience of viewing TikTok. So that's great.

573
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,800
Speaker 5:  That's very important. It obviously is winning and everyone's scared of it

574
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,600
Speaker 5:  and throwing their hands up and rebooting their apps as TikTok. Sure.

575
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,000
Speaker 5:  That's the consumer side, right? That's the watching TikTok side. The part

576
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,600
Speaker 5:  of TikTok that I think is undercover, under discussed under

577
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,400
Speaker 5:  reported on is that it is a video editor that

578
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,040
Speaker 5:  like large groups of college students have all learned to use

579
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:50,000
Speaker 5:  like expert, video editors. It like guides you into making

580
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:54,240
Speaker 5:  kinds of content that very few video editors have ever

581
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,680
Speaker 5:  guided anyone into making. Yeah. And like that piece of

582
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,200
Speaker 5:  TikTok success is fascinating to me

583
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,520
Speaker 5:  like the duets and responses. What

584
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,240
Speaker 5:  are they called? The stitch screen one, the stitches. So duets and

585
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,080
Speaker 5:  stitches, like they have developed a language of video communication on

586
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,920
Speaker 5:  TikTok. And then there are TikTok editing challenges. Like you see

587
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,440
Speaker 5:  that TikTok is expressed to its users is as much about

588
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,200
Speaker 5:  creation as it is about consumption. Right. I think that is super cool.

589
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,600
Speaker 6:  I totally agree. I just don't think TikTok invented that. Like I think I

590
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,720
Speaker 6:  would say if you wanna go back and find like a, a house style of vertical

591
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,760
Speaker 6:  video, like Snapchat is the answer. Ooh, not that it was like

592
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,680
Speaker 7:  I had to, I had to bring

593
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,520
Speaker 6:  It up. Don't talk to me about fine. All my favorite TikTok accounts are

594
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:45,440
Speaker 6:  just old vines and I love it very, but that's a whole separate story, but

595
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,120
Speaker 6:  I think like, and this is part of what, and we should get into some of the

596
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,200
Speaker 6:  news from this week, but I think the, the thing that you're getting at that's

597
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Speaker 6:  super interesting to me is that like we are now in this place where it is

598
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,080
Speaker 6:  just vertical video and everybody's fighting about where it comes from and

599
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,720
Speaker 6:  who sees it and all that stuff. But like the thing they're I think starting

600
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,320
Speaker 6:  to realize is that like, if we can build the best creation tools,

601
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,000
Speaker 6:  that's actually one big, huge way to win. And like Snapchat had the

602
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,240
Speaker 6:  filters and Instagram is starting to build really advanced stuff and TikTok,

603
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,640
Speaker 6:  like I think you're right. That TikTok has like developed this

604
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,800
Speaker 5:  TikTok did its

605
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,960
Speaker 6:  Language of cinema in a really cool

606
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,520
Speaker 5:  Way. Yeah.

607
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,080
Speaker 6:  I'm not. And yeah. And did it in a huge way for sure.

608
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,480
Speaker 5:  But like if you just step back, like apple had iMovie,

609
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,360
Speaker 5:  they had clips, dear sweet clips, which only Deone ever loved.

610
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,040
Speaker 5:  I

611
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,640
Speaker 6:  Forgot about that.

612
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,880
Speaker 5:  Right. They, what apple had was a creation tool that a lot of people liked.

613
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,320
Speaker 5:  I mean, I was an kid again, steam engine uphill, both ways.

614
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:44,200
Speaker 5:  That was me just like adjusting millimeter footage off of Sony camera

615
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,880
Speaker 5:  on iLink. Remember when sunny tried to rebrand fire wires, iLink, let's do

616
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,440
Speaker 5:  an hour on that.

617
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,600
Speaker 7:  I will do a whole hour with you ne on that it very up upsetting

618
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,160
Speaker 5:  FireWire 800. What happened one hour of the verge cast?

619
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,520
Speaker 5:  Can I just tell you my it and gadget years ago when apple finally

620
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,320
Speaker 5:  killed FireWire I made an entire video montage of fire wire

621
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,160
Speaker 5:  ports set to boys to men. And then this was

622
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,760
Speaker 5:  before TikTok existed, cuz this would've been like a perfect TikTok. So I

623
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,680
Speaker 5:  had to go get AOL's custom video player and be like, I need to

624
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,160
Speaker 5:  upload a video. And they're like, what's the content I was like, I don't

625
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,640
Speaker 5:  want to tell you,

626
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,800
Speaker 7:  Did you edit it in

627
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,280
Speaker 5:  IMovie? I don't want you to watch this. I did. It was great on your anyway.

628
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,440
Speaker 6:  That was the day AOL went out of business.

629
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,520
Speaker 5:  They were like, you should leave and start your own website neon

630
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,400
Speaker 5:  anyhow. But apple had all these creation tools. It never had a distribution

631
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Speaker 5:  platform. Yeah. Right, right. There was not, it was just not their thought

632
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,000
Speaker 5:  that connecting creation and distribution would be important. YouTube famously

633
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,040
Speaker 5:  is still the best, most lucrative preferred video distribution

634
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,520
Speaker 5:  platform for almost every internet creator. It's got the best revenue it's

635
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,040
Speaker 5:  got the biggest community shorts. Is that performing the main thing, shorts

636
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,480
Speaker 5:  again is app as expressed by YouTube.

637
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:03,040
Speaker 5:  But it, it, it dropped the ball on the creation side.

638
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,000
Speaker 5:  Almost completely like to be a high end YouTuber. You have to give

639
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,200
Speaker 5:  to Adobe premier or final cut or right. Make videos

640
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,920
Speaker 5:  about why final cut is actually good. And then you get a million vs. Like

641
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,200
Speaker 5:  it's you just end up in a place where YouTube doesn't help you create anything.

642
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:21,160
Speaker 5:  They're starting to do that in shorts because app, but it's weird that the

643
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,560
Speaker 5:  biggest distribution platform never really cared about the creation element.

644
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,640
Speaker 5:  I think what I, when I say TikTok is the winner, is they married those two

645
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,800
Speaker 5:  things in a gigantic way. Yeah.

646
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,320
Speaker 6:  Totally

647
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,920
Speaker 5:  Snap in stories with filters did that sort of, but there was no virality

648
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,560
Speaker 5:  associated with snap. TikTok is like virality for days,

649
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,400
Speaker 5:  plus this huge creation tool. But now you're seeing

650
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,880
Speaker 7:  On like the right device too. Right? Like they, they put it on the right

651
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,880
Speaker 7:  device. They didn't put it on your, your computer. They put it on your phone,

652
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,800
Speaker 7:  which is what most younger people are using as a computer.

653
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah. No, I think that's all right. It just funny to me that there's been,

654
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,800
Speaker 5:  there's been this historic split TikTok collapses a split. Yeah. But now

655
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,520
Speaker 5:  you've got Instagram, you've got YouTube shorts. You've got

656
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,720
Speaker 5:  TikTok. They've all got these powerful creation tools in them. And they are

657
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,560
Speaker 5:  trying to gate keep the creation tools and lock them to their own

658
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Speaker 5:  distribution cuz that's where their money is. And historically

659
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,880
Speaker 5:  creation tools have not been wedded to or tied or

660
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,520
Speaker 5:  limited to one distribution platform.

661
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,360
Speaker 6:  Does it ever blow your mind to think about the fact that this is like the

662
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,040
Speaker 6:  wireless carriers not wanting to be dumb pipes and this is why all the streaming

663
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,200
Speaker 6:  services don't wanna play with universal search because they all want you

664
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,440
Speaker 6:  to hang out inside of their apps. Like every industry is the same,

665
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,560
Speaker 6:  some of the nouns change, but everybody is like, everybody makes the same

666
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,720
Speaker 6:  stuff and then goes, oh no, we're the same stuff. How do we make sure people

667
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,920
Speaker 6:  don't think of us as the same as everybody else? And then does this and this

668
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,360
Speaker 6:  is where we

669
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,640
Speaker 5:  Are. And the answer is software restrictions and it's like

670
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,480
Speaker 6:  Watermarks.

671
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,000
Speaker 5:  So in watermark. So just this week,

672
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,560
Speaker 5:  YouTube shorts, the editor will now put a watermark. If you export out of

673
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,480
Speaker 5:  YouTube shorts and repost and want to take it somewhere else, how could you

674
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,520
Speaker 5:  Instagram? This is our own social team discovered this, this week,

675
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,560
Speaker 5:  Instagram has a really powerful green screen tool for real. So they were

676
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,520
Speaker 5:  just using it and they would export the video and use it for other

677
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,360
Speaker 5:  stuff. And now Instagram just mutes that video

678
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,960
Speaker 5:  when you export it, it has no audio,

679
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,560
Speaker 6:  Unless this is my favorite part is unless you share it first on reels.

680
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,280
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

681
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:26,560
Speaker 6:  Which is fantastic. They're like, do whatever you want. Just put it on reels

682
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:26,720
Speaker 6:  first.

683
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:32,000
Speaker 5:  It's perfect. I mean, I just think that there's something

684
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,120
Speaker 5:  here where the idea of creation tools being

685
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,640
Speaker 5:  locked or tied or limited to distribution

686
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,420
Speaker 5:  is new in the culture. Right? It that's it's

687
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,260
Speaker 5:  meaningfully new because historically again,

688
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,620
Speaker 5:  the creation tools have never had distribution connected to them. And the

689
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,140
Speaker 5:  distribution platforms have never had creation tools connected to them. And

690
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,820
Speaker 5:  now it's like, what if we software lock you into this garden? When

691
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,060
Speaker 7:  Do you think they start charging?

692
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,980
Speaker 5:  My suspicion is that people are gonna react to this extremely negatively.

693
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,910
Speaker 7:  You don't think they're gonna just charge people, be like, oh, you wanna

694
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,470
Speaker 7:  unlock it. You wanna export it wherever for $2 a month

695
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,390
Speaker 7:  to Instagram, you can do whatever you want with the video you make for us.

696
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:17,210
Speaker 5:  I don't, I think it would have to be like $400 a month. Like the, the lifetime

697
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,210
Speaker 5:  value of the Instagram library getting bigger is bigger than any

698
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,290
Speaker 5:  dollars that you could pay them as a consumer. Like you just gotta do the

699
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:28,170
Speaker 5:  math, right? Like Instagram is staring down the barrel of a 10

700
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,770
Speaker 5:  billion TikTok shaped gun. Yeah. How are you gonna, how you gonna make that

701
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,240
Speaker 5:  up? You can't, it's not $2.

702
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:37,040
Speaker 6:  And they all see each other as super zero sum, which I think is really

703
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,000
Speaker 6:  interesting. Like the idea that these apps are not in a position of being

704
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,960
Speaker 6:  able to like just sort of let a thousand flowers bloom and

705
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,360
Speaker 6:  be like, you know, there's enough attention for everybody. People are on

706
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,200
Speaker 6:  our app. They are like directly threatened by each

707
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,240
Speaker 6:  other now, which I think really interesting. And it is like the only

708
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,360
Speaker 6:  conclusion I can draw from that is that they have all begun to understand

709
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,040
Speaker 6:  that these serve the same purpose for the same set of people. And that ultimately

710
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,120
Speaker 6:  only one of them is probably going to win and everybody kind of thinks it's

711
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,880
Speaker 6:  gonna be TikTok. So they are like desperately fighting against

712
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:13,440
Speaker 6:  that pull away. Cause like if I'm YouTube, I don't know that I would

713
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:13,920
Speaker 6:  necessarily

714
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:19,320
Speaker 6:  feel like I'm existentially threatened by TikTok. If I wanted to go do

715
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,120
Speaker 6:  a different thing. But now YouTube is like, no, we have to fight with TikTok

716
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,120
Speaker 6:  and they have to take every advantage they can away from TikTok, which I

717
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,000
Speaker 6:  think is fascinating.

718
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,720
Speaker 5:  So YouTube has the big advantage, which is it

719
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,920
Speaker 5:  has the best revenue share program for all those

720
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,400
Speaker 5:  platforms for actual creators to make money on platforms. Yeah. No one makes

721
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,160
Speaker 5:  money in TikTok. As far as I can tell. I won't say the dreaded

722
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,720
Speaker 5:  DWORD here, but there's another very good podcast where I

723
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,760
Speaker 6:  Was about to bring it up. Hank green was so good on decoder. There you go.

724
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,160
Speaker 5:  And

725
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,280
Speaker 6:  You said a lot of stuff I thought was interesting.

726
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Hank Green's like, no one makes money in TikTok, but that's where the

727
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,520
Speaker 5:  audience is. It's also easier and cheaper for me to get there. And you know,

728
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,160
Speaker 5:  his feeling is like all of that adds up to his YouTube audience growing and

729
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,240
Speaker 5:  his business doing well. But he also said YouTube shorts is growing faster.

730
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:06,520
Speaker 5:  And once YouTube flips on the money, which they already can do,

731
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,480
Speaker 5:  they've already built the model. So they don't have to like go and explain

732
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,960
Speaker 5:  it to the board of directors or model. Like they already have it. I think

733
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,120
Speaker 5:  they might win because people will obviously go where the money is.

734
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,520
Speaker 5:  And that's great, but it's not gonna solve the like long tail problem of

735
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,280
Speaker 5:  TikTok, which is, there are lots of people on TikTok who are not there to

736
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,960
Speaker 5:  make money. Yeah. Right. And they're just having a good time with a cool

737
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,720
Speaker 5:  video editor that happens to be connected to a distribution platform that

738
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,880
Speaker 5:  might make you go viral at any time and deliver you a hundred dollars from

739
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,440
Speaker 5:  the creator's fund. And that's like a good enough incentive program compared

740
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,320
Speaker 5:  to, to YouTube where everyone wants a career as a YouTuber. And that

741
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,840
Speaker 5:  is a different game to play.

742
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,400
Speaker 7:  I just kind of, I was gonna say, I wonder why people there is this big

743
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:49,280
Speaker 7:  existential like crisis for a lot of these app makers, because

744
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,730
Speaker 7:  Facebook meta at Google, they have like the ad game unlock.

745
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,490
Speaker 7:  They know how to monetize this stuff and make money. And TikTok

746
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,130
Speaker 7:  does TikTok is TikTok making money, handover fist like

747
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,970
Speaker 7:  to bring up mine again, is it gonna be,

748
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,690
Speaker 5:  They're not sharing it back to creators.

749
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:07,770
Speaker 7:  Right? And so like,

750
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,450
Speaker 5:  No. So TikTok is a black box is owned by, by dance. We don't know how by

751
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:14,850
Speaker 5:  dance is doing as a company, but all the reporting suggests

752
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,410
Speaker 5:  that TikTok advertising is effective. They're collecting those ad dollars.

753
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:22,690
Speaker 5:  And like the music industry loves

754
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:26,810
Speaker 5:  TikTok. Yes. And TikTok loves the music industry because if you

755
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:30,250
Speaker 5:  have, if you are Beyonce's record label and publicist,

756
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:34,440
Speaker 5:  you're like these songs are gonna go viral this week and TikTok will all,

757
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,360
Speaker 5:  but certainly make that happen for you. Yes. And like that's a, that's

758
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,560
Speaker 5:  a revenue generation program

759
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,400
Speaker 7:  Program. So that's so like, that's why they're

760
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,800
Speaker 5:  Scared. Right? Cuz they, they TikTok is the culture like for better or worse,

761
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,480
Speaker 5:  if you're listening to this, you're like, oh TikTok, like TikTok drives a

762
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,080
Speaker 5:  massive amount of the culture now. Yes. Because it's

763
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,680
Speaker 5:  ability to generate virality, it's ability to generate trends and the trends

764
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,360
Speaker 5:  come and go in the blink of an eye.

765
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,920
Speaker 5:  Rebecca Jennings at Vox has written about this very compellingly. Like you

766
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:06,680
Speaker 5:  don't, it's impossible to be a trends reporter anymore because all the trends

767
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,200
Speaker 5:  are happening all the time. And then they go away like, see shanties, do

768
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,600
Speaker 5:  not say anything about the state of America. Right. But like for one

769
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,560
Speaker 5:  week C shanties were very important to everyone cuz it just happened. And

770
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,040
Speaker 5:  then it went

771
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,240
Speaker 5:  away. I was a Rebecca piece. You should go read it. It's pretty good. But

772
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:26,040
Speaker 5:  Instagram isn't that thing anymore. And it used to be, and I think they feel

773
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,640
Speaker 5:  it going away YouTube. I don't know if it was ever that thing

774
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:33,640
Speaker 5:  because it was always everything. Yeah. Right. Like when we were

775
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,880
Speaker 5:  covering YouTube stars and that, that period of YouTube, when

776
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,320
Speaker 5:  we could cover YouTube stars, like they were aliens and we were explaining

777
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,480
Speaker 5:  them to the world. Like that felt like a thing we were actually doing. Like

778
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,440
Speaker 5:  here's a whole culture. You don't see over here on YouTube. Have you heard

779
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,360
Speaker 5:  a Logan? But now they're just like everywhere. You know? Like they they've,

780
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,160
Speaker 5:  they've transitioned into the culture at large and YouTube is still

781
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:56,400
Speaker 5:  manufacturing some of those moments, but not nearly at the rate of TikTok.

782
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,960
Speaker 5:  And I just think fundamentally yes, it is a zero sunscreen. You only

783
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,920
Speaker 5:  have so many minutes in the day. And if you want app TikTok right now is

784
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,720
Speaker 5:  best app, you know?

785
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,880
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think that's well and I think what's, what's gonna be interesting

786
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,520
Speaker 6:  for me to watch is like the, the upside of

787
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,160
Speaker 6:  shorts for YouTube is that it can then, like, I think the, the company

788
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,040
Speaker 6:  closest to sort of being able to wrap all of this together is probably

789
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,640
Speaker 6:  YouTube. Right? It has the giant audience shorts seems to be taking off.

790
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,880
Speaker 6:  It has the monetization strategy. It's like YouTube is, is sort of the

791
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,760
Speaker 6:  end point. Like even people on TikTok make their TikTok money on

792
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,800
Speaker 6:  YouTube. Like that's, that's where you go to make your money. So tick like

793
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,680
Speaker 6:  YouTube has already solved the hard part of this. What TikTok has not figured

794
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,360
Speaker 6:  out is how to like build home bases for people who do this for a living

795
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:47,520
Speaker 6:  and really no one other than YouTube has ever figured this out.

796
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:51,200
Speaker 6:  And so I think, I mean, Twitch has like, we see all these rumors about TikTok

797
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,160
Speaker 6:  Twitch

798
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,240
Speaker 7:  Figured it out,

799
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,360
Speaker 6:  Twitch figured it out. That's fair. Twitch is like a, a specific niche

800
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,600
Speaker 6:  of the world, but has definitely figured it out. That's totally fair. Yeah.

801
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,760
Speaker 6:  But I think other than those two, like Facebook never really figured it out

802
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,120
Speaker 6:  Snapchat hasn't figured it out TikTok hasn't figured it out. And I think

803
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:10,800
Speaker 6:  like you look at like TikTok music, which I think is, is gonna be a thing

804
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,440
Speaker 6:  that exists and has been rumored forever, but is them trying to build

805
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,880
Speaker 6:  an end point, right? Like you come to TikTok, you go to Lincoln bio and you

806
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,600
Speaker 6:  leave eventually to go make some money for somebody. And TikTok would like

807
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,520
Speaker 6:  to pull more of that back in. And my sense is that's hard, but whether

808
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:30,120
Speaker 6:  it's harder than getting people to spend three hours just scrolling through

809
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,960
Speaker 6:  videos on your app is gonna be like the big question for you too.

810
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,240
Speaker 7:  I mean, I think it is hard because you're seeing like a lot of these, these

811
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:40,120
Speaker 7:  fandoms for these, these followers and or these creators and just fandoms

812
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,760
Speaker 7:  in general, you're seeing that, that huge decentralization, like they, they

813
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,200
Speaker 7:  are there aren't hubs for these people anymore. It is all just word of mouth

814
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,280
Speaker 7:  and, and sharing and, and all these back channels. So I think that's really,

815
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,440
Speaker 7:  really difficult for TikTok, which is why I keep coming back to like, is

816
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:57,840
Speaker 7:  TikTok built to last like yes, anybody can be really good at like creating

817
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:01,000
Speaker 7:  the culture for a couple of years. We've seen that again and again and again,

818
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,920
Speaker 7:  anybody can do glee was the culture. Glee

819
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,320
Speaker 7:  did not last, sorry.

820
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,640
Speaker 5:  I'm sorry. I, I do not agree with you G it was the culture.

821
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,920
Speaker 7:  It was unfortu very much the culture true.

822
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:17,560
Speaker 5:  I'm 1000% on a podcast with two like musical theater kids. And I

823
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,800
Speaker 5:  just need to tell you that you're wrong about this situation,

824
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,160
Speaker 7:  But, but there are these things that like, it's not true, regardless of,

825
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,480
Speaker 7:  if you agree with glee, there are these various things that are like, this

826
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,960
Speaker 7:  is the center of culture. This is what we all care about. Yeah. And, and

827
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,800
Speaker 7:  especially for younger people, which is what most of talk's audience is.

828
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,760
Speaker 7:  My dad excluded. He like watches it every night. He calls it like his show,

829
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,880
Speaker 7:  his tos. And he is like, I get in bed and I watch my tos.

830
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,680
Speaker 6:  It's like his stories. Oh, I

831
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,280
Speaker 7:  Love that. It is his stories. It's great. Oh no. But like, for the most part,

832
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,200
Speaker 7:  it is younger people and, and they, they do move

833
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,000
Speaker 7:  around very quickly. And this is like, it is hard

834
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,600
Speaker 7:  to lock people in right now, lock people to like

835
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,560
Speaker 7:  a specific hub. And so I like, I,

836
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,240
Speaker 7:  I'm still not sold that TikTok is gonna be this huge behemoth. I think it's

837
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,520
Speaker 7:  doing very, very successful, very, very right now. But like, I don't see

838
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,320
Speaker 7:  where that long term game is beyond music partnerships.

839
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,040
Speaker 7:  And even then we've heard like Lizzo doing great traction on

840
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,840
Speaker 7:  TikTok. Isn't necessarily translating to sales for

841
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:20,240
Speaker 7:  Lizzo. So like,

842
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,720
Speaker 5:  Well, nothing translates to sales anymore. Yeah.

843
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,400
Speaker 7:  It's yeah. Then that's the other part it's like where, yeah, I just don't

844
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,080
Speaker 7:  know how, how long this lasts for them before people get fed up with

845
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,920
Speaker 7:  TikTok TikTok, it's canceled by the teens and then they all

846
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,680
Speaker 7:  move on to what discord, YouTube, YouTube,

847
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,000
Speaker 7:  they all just, they just come back to YouTube and they're like, have you

848
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,200
Speaker 7:  heard

849
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,960
Speaker 5:  Of this place? I disagree. I think TikTok TikTok and its current rate

850
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:48,120
Speaker 5:  is bound to succeed because it is one supported by

851
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,920
Speaker 5:  the Chinese government, which really wants it to succeed. And actually its

852
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,520
Speaker 5:  biggest ex existential threat is that the United States government

853
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:59,400
Speaker 5:  is aware that the Chinese government supports TikTok and might one day just

854
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,320
Speaker 5:  turn it off, which I will remind you that a previous president decided

855
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,200
Speaker 5:  he was just going to do without a plan and almost sold to

856
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,800
Speaker 7:  Microsoft. Oracle, go buy this. Hey, you, you got some money. Yes.

857
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,040
Speaker 7:  Do it.

858
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,960
Speaker 5:  Oracle is taking over the TikTok data centers. Like it's a weird deal

859
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:17,120
Speaker 5:  over at TikTok land.

860
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:21,080
Speaker 6:  There really is a wild like sliding doors moment. Like just to totally

861
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,200
Speaker 6:  derail this just for one quick second, like imagining what this

862
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,960
Speaker 6:  like August of 20, 22 would be like if Oracle or

863
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:32,960
Speaker 6:  Microsoft owned TikTok. And like the culture had changed around

864
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:37,160
Speaker 6:  that for the last two years is like, like we're gonna do a 10th

865
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,800
Speaker 6:  anniversary, like science fiction and reverse. Like what if Microsoft

866
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,360
Speaker 6:  owned TikTok thing and I'm, I'm already excited about it.

867
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,440
Speaker 5:  I will remind you that such and Adella. I think it was at the code conference

868
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,320
Speaker 5:  was like, that was some of the weirdest conversations I've ever had

869
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,240
Speaker 5:  was like we had to be in it cuz like how could we not try to buy TikTok?

870
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:58,880
Speaker 5:  Because like it was weird and then it went away for the best

871
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,640
Speaker 5:  weird. Yeah. I, I don't know. Like, I don't know if it was for the best,

872
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:06,680
Speaker 5:  like I'm not saying that the operation of that version of our

873
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,440
Speaker 5:  government was ever stable or smooth, but sometimes like they,

874
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,080
Speaker 5:  you know, broken clock twice a day, like they're like TikTok is owned by

875
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,040
Speaker 5:  the Chinese. We should take a harder line about it. Yeah. That might

876
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,680
Speaker 5:  have, that might have been the correct. I think that is coming for TikTok

877
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:24,600
Speaker 5:  much more than gen Z deciding that

878
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,200
Speaker 5:  what they like is reading long blog posts on Tumblr again,

879
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:31,880
Speaker 5:  which would be amazing. I would love that if that is the next move

880
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:34,760
Speaker 5:  it's but I don't, I don't think that's likely.

881
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:39,320
Speaker 6:  So here's what I wonder about this is like, does this mean that the next

882
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:43,320
Speaker 6:  thing we're gonna get is like a really powerful

883
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,040
Speaker 6:  cross-platform vertical video creation tool that does all these things

884
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,880
Speaker 6:  like part of me thinks somewhere Evan Spiegel and the snap

885
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:55,640
Speaker 6:  executive team are just like leaning back in their chairs, being like, come

886
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,520
Speaker 6:  make stuff with us. We don't watermark let's let's hang out.

887
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,320
Speaker 6:  But then I also wonder like is, is the next phase of this? Just

888
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:06,840
Speaker 6:  that everything silos really aggressively is it that we all get

889
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:10,600
Speaker 6:  less confused seeing YouTube watermarks in

890
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,440
Speaker 6:  TikTok and TikTok watermarks in YouTube and nobody actually cares. And this

891
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,560
Speaker 6:  isn't really a thing or is there a new thing that comes up?

892
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,280
Speaker 5:  Well, no, the platforms are detecting the watermarks. Oh, that's true. That's

893
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,120
Speaker 5:  the thing. Yeah. So YouTube will detect the TikTok watermark and then downright

894
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:24,560
Speaker 5:  that video.

895
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:25,080
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

896
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,880
Speaker 5:  I love it. So there's just a, again, my thesis here

897
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,400
Speaker 5:  is that creation and distribution have never been so tightly tied together

898
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:37,120
Speaker 5:  and that imposing the business limits of the distribution platform on the

899
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,240
Speaker 5:  creation tool is bad. And that eventually the

900
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,080
Speaker 5:  people who use the creation tools will be frustrated enough to enact

901
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:48,680
Speaker 5:  some sort of penalty on those platforms. We'll see. But I

902
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,560
Speaker 5:  don't think that the answer is snapping. Like for four bucks a month, you

903
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,480
Speaker 5:  can use the snap video editor cuz they have to keep pace with the

904
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,200
Speaker 5:  coolest tools in TikTok. And talk's greatest success is

905
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,440
Speaker 5:  adding tools that people then use in like

906
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:07,920
Speaker 5:  viral recursive, conversant ways with one another. And that

907
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,840
Speaker 5:  is I, they have been better at creating that loop than any of these

908
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,520
Speaker 5:  other platforms.

909
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:16,480
Speaker 6:  So really the company that should be like licking its chops at this is like

910
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,720
Speaker 6:  Vimeo and the other like active creation. I'm serious. Like

911
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,360
Speaker 6:  if, if we, if this

912
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:26,120
Speaker 5:  Vis like a B to B video, white label hosting service, now I

913
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,040
Speaker 6:  Don't. Yeah, it is now that's fair. But so, okay. So that's the thing like

914
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,400
Speaker 6:  who is it then? Then the thing that's gonna happen is somebody is going to

915
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,920
Speaker 6:  like sit above this and it's like, you remember the thing when they, everybody

916
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,920
Speaker 6:  built like the hoot suites of the world, where it's like, you can publish

917
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,160
Speaker 6:  to all your social channels in an automated way. And it's not such a disaster

918
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,320
Speaker 6:  to manage a hundred different things. Like that's gotta be coming for vertical

919
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:45,880
Speaker 6:  video. Now

920
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:49,840
Speaker 5:  Maybe I, well maybe hoo suite for app.

921
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,320
Speaker 5:  If the, who suite people are listening, you can just take that idea, please,

922
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,240
Speaker 5:  please name it. Who tweet for app? We'll we'll know what

923
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,360
Speaker 5:  happened and we won't be mad. I don't know. It's not like there's

924
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,040
Speaker 5:  great upload APIs for these. Like these are

925
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:08,960
Speaker 5:  very restricted platforms in a way that, you know, Twitter

926
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:13,160
Speaker 5:  for all of its problems has, has an API that other people like

927
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,760
Speaker 5:  when we post stories from our CMS, they just get tweeted

928
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,560
Speaker 5:  automatically because Twitter is built. That kind of integration. I

929
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:20,840
Speaker 5:  don't know.

930
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:24,320
Speaker 6:  So this next phase, this next phase just sucks for cross platform

931
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,440
Speaker 6:  creators then yes.

932
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,520
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think, I think it's gonna get harder. Cause

933
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:27,960
Speaker 7:  Everything silo.

934
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,640
Speaker 5:  That's what I'm saying.

935
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,320
Speaker 7:  Everybody's

936
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,320
Speaker 5:  Got their, I think eventually creators are going to say this is stupid.

937
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:36,600
Speaker 5:  We don't wanna live in your walls because Adobe premier

938
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:41,280
Speaker 5:  is never been gated. Like this iMovie has not gated like this creation except

939
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,520
Speaker 5:  that they be gated to.

940
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,680
Speaker 7:  I figured it out guys. I figured it out Sonology is gonna create a

941
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,600
Speaker 7:  really good widget and everybody's just gonna buy a

942
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,400
Speaker 7:  Sonology and upload their videos. And you're gonna like type in the

943
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:58,080
Speaker 7:  IP address for the person's house and get your vertical videos.

944
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,200
Speaker 5:  Oh, direct,

945
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,040
Speaker 7:  Direct just, oh, instead of going fully into the cloud,

946
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,400
Speaker 7:  totally siloed. Everybody's gonna get fed up and be like, we all have our

947
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,720
Speaker 7:  little Sonology tos.

948
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,060
Speaker 5:  It's Plex. It's push video.

949
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:11,700
Speaker 7:  It's gonna be great.

950
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,660
Speaker 6:  All right. Do you think Plex can fix this, Alex? What

951
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:15,860
Speaker 7:  Are your thoughts? They got this.

952
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:16,660
Speaker 6:  Okay,

953
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,660
Speaker 5:  Cool. Have you have you install

954
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,420
Speaker 7:  Plex in? No, I need to. I thought,

955
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,940
Speaker 5:  Alright, well we're gonna take a break. Alex is gonna install Plex on her

956
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,580
Speaker 5:  steam deck. We got some car stuff. We got a lightning around coming up. We'll

957
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:28,940
Speaker 5:  be right back.

958
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,010
Speaker 5:  Okay. We're back bunch of car news, but I'm not gonna start with

959
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,770
Speaker 5:  deadhead car news. I'm gonna start with extremely wonky FCC news because

960
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,970
Speaker 5:  you know how I love some extremely wonky FCC news.

961
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,650
Speaker 5:  Okay. The car industry lost a court case this week. That

962
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:55,730
Speaker 5:  is like one of my favorite, just dumb conflicts

963
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:58,370
Speaker 6:  In the world. Wait, like the whole car industry. Does the car industry have

964
00:56:58,370 --> 00:56:59,090
Speaker 6:  like a lawyer?

965
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,730
Speaker 5:  Well, they have an industry group. Oh,

966
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,210
Speaker 7:  So they got wrecked.

967
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:07,170
Speaker 5:  So yes, they got wrecked. So in like the late

968
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:10,890
Speaker 5:  nineties, like in 1999, the FCC set aside all the

969
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:14,690
Speaker 5:  spectrum in a 5.9 gigahertz band for something

970
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:18,610
Speaker 5:  called V2 V vehicle to vehicle communications. And then they added

971
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,490
Speaker 5:  V to I vehicle to infrastructure communications, and then they make it all

972
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:25,370
Speaker 5:  sound cool. They started calling it VTX. Yes. Which is very funny.

973
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,770
Speaker 5:  Sure. So the FCC is like car industry make the cars safer, make

974
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:33,490
Speaker 5:  them all talk to each other, make them talk to stop lights, right?

975
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,370
Speaker 5:  Solve traffic jams. You won't hit each other. Here's a big

976
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,210
Speaker 5:  chunk of spectrum. Like good spectrum for you to figure this

977
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:45,110
Speaker 5:  out. I have been to like 5,000

978
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:48,750
Speaker 5:  CES demos of V to V and Vida I stuff.

979
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,310
Speaker 5:  Right. And like car makers would be like with this new technology, the cars

980
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:57,350
Speaker 5:  can see through each other. We can predict traffic. We can slow you down.

981
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:00,950
Speaker 5:  We can see what's happening up on the road. We can make sure you hit all

982
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:04,950
Speaker 5:  the stoplights perfectly on time. It's here. And then none of it ever

983
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:05,190
Speaker 5:  ships,

984
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:09,750
Speaker 6:  But it's a, just, this is like the right idea, right? Yes. Like, is, is this

985
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,910
Speaker 6:  just like, okay. Cuz it always, I I've, I've spent less time with car people

986
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:15,830
Speaker 6:  at CES than you have. But even in the, like I spent a bunch of time with

987
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:19,630
Speaker 6:  Qualcomm, like four or five years ago and all they talked about was V to

988
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,750
Speaker 6:  V stuff. And it's like, okay, the idea that I don't just have to rely on

989
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:26,510
Speaker 6:  my phone's CA or on my car's cameras to see everything that's going on, I

990
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:30,150
Speaker 6:  can actually let my car talk to the other car and to the

991
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,870
Speaker 6:  stoplight and they can all understand what's going on that way. It seems

992
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:35,310
Speaker 6:  like the right, like in a perfect world, that's how they should work. Right.

993
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:38,670
Speaker 7:  Yeah. But David, have you considered that these are the same people that

994
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,870
Speaker 7:  make like in car HUDs and, and in

995
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:46,470
Speaker 7:  car comp, like it's the same people that are like, we need a S Schor

996
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,670
Speaker 7:  version of the car, so you can turn your lights off and on

997
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,110
Speaker 7:  like of course,

998
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:56,030
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You have to tap on the truck to, to, to change the climate in

999
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:59,430
Speaker 5:  Your truck. Okay. So to be fair, like a tiny handful of

1000
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:02,670
Speaker 5:  extremely expensive luxury cars shipped with like VTV radios,

1001
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:07,790
Speaker 5:  the 2017 Mercedes-Benz E-Class and S class

1002
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:12,790
Speaker 5:  Cadillac CTS in 2017. Okay. Three

1003
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:13,910
Speaker 6:  Talking to nothing.

1004
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,390
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Just, just rolling around talking to nothing.

1005
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:22,720
Speaker 5:  And then they started, I mean, all these names are great and then, you know,

1006
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:26,400
Speaker 5:  5g happened. Everyone's like 5g will do it. And they started calling it cellular

1007
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,240
Speaker 5:  V two X or CV two X.

1008
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,240
Speaker 6:  Yes. Oh my God.

1009
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:32,280
Speaker 5:  Nothing resonates with the consumers like CV two X.

1010
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,720
Speaker 5:  Okay. So then 2017 Trump

1011
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,640
Speaker 5:  FCC, which was just a wrecking ball of ideas,

1012
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:45,720
Speaker 5:  got rid of a regulation that Obama's FCC had put in

1013
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,160
Speaker 5:  saying, all the cars needed VTV stuff, right? How do you get over the hump

1014
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,440
Speaker 5:  of no cars having it? You just write the law, saying all the cars need to

1015
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,800
Speaker 5:  have it. We all need to do it. Cars are gonna stop crashing into each other,

1016
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:58,520
Speaker 5:  not the Trump FCC, which didn't do it to be fair. It had been

1017
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,520
Speaker 5:  17 years, right? Like they, they set us on the spectrum in

1018
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,600
Speaker 5:  1999 in 2017, nothing is shipping. So

1019
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:10,360
Speaker 5:  our boy, a Jeep pie is like, screw it.

1020
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,520
Speaker 5:  I'm giving a bunch of the spectrum back to unlicensed

1021
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:18,600
Speaker 5:  usage, which is a big trend lately. So maybe we'll have 5.9 gig

1022
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,240
Speaker 5:  Hertz wifi now. And you can still keep a little chunk of this

1023
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,400
Speaker 5:  for cellular B two X CB two X.

1024
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:29,970
Speaker 5:  So the automakers industry groups are like, don't do this. We need it.

1025
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:34,410
Speaker 5:  If we, if wifi will interfere with our radios, that don't exist.

1026
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:37,570
Speaker 5:  The Alliance for automotive innovation

1027
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:43,490
Speaker 5:  promised 5 million cars would have VV over the next five

1028
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:46,490
Speaker 5:  years, but they wouldn't do it if the FCC gave the spectrum

1029
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:51,260
Speaker 5:  away. Okay. So they file the lawsuit. The lawsuit comes out

1030
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:54,740
Speaker 5:  and the judge is like, what are you talking about? No intelligent

1031
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:58,660
Speaker 5:  transportation systems have been developed as of 2020, no,

1032
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:02,620
Speaker 5:  commercially marketed vehicles used 5.9 gig. It hurts to

1033
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:06,020
Speaker 5:  provide vehicle safety features. And then he's like your argument

1034
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:10,100
Speaker 5:  that you need all this spectrum for new technologies

1035
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,140
Speaker 5:  is not great. Noting the petitioners have directed us to no significant

1036
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,780
Speaker 5:  developments in the field of yet to arrive technologies.

1037
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:17,940
Speaker 6:  So good.

1038
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:22,380
Speaker 5:  This isn't judge saying your shit's of vaporware. Yes. It makes

1039
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,220
Speaker 5:  me so happy.

1040
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:25,420
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1041
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,340
Speaker 6:  The field of yet to arrive technologies yeah. Is like the, the,

1042
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,540
Speaker 6:  the beginning of a book title about vaporware that I would very much

1043
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:36,100
Speaker 5:  Read. It's so good. And it's like, this is such a good idea. You guys never

1044
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:39,620
Speaker 5:  shipped it. It was vapor for so long that eventually the United States government

1045
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:41,740
Speaker 5:  was like, we're gonna dunk on you a little bit for a while.

1046
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,100
Speaker 6:  The

1047
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,660
Speaker 5:  Very good, well, hopefully our wifi riders get better and hopefully

1048
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,060
Speaker 5:  5g actually does. It's like they drive robot surgeons to your house and self-driving

1049
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:54,020
Speaker 5:  cars. That, that's what Verizon's ad said. Sure. 5g.

1050
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,820
Speaker 6:  So is V2 V like dead now? Like what, what

1051
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:59,500
Speaker 5:  Happens? No, cuz they're, they're they're supposed to put 5g radios in the

1052
01:01:59,500 --> 01:01:59,660
Speaker 5:  cars.

1053
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,460
Speaker 6:  Oh. So 5g will fix it.

1054
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:07,180
Speaker 5:  They still have a tiny little chunk of this spectrum reserve for that use,

1055
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,180
Speaker 5:  but they wanted it all and they, they just didn't use it for 20 years. Yeah.

1056
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:14,940
Speaker 5:  So now it's coming back to unlicensed usage for wifi, which I think is probably

1057
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,300
Speaker 5:  the right decision. Yes. But it's like use it or lose it pro like

1058
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:22,480
Speaker 6:  Yeah. 20 years seems like long enough to try to do something

1059
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,480
Speaker 6:  functional. Here.

1060
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,520
Speaker 5:  It is very good.

1061
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:29,960
Speaker 5:  Other car news, big study, EV owners don't like the

1062
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,520
Speaker 5:  broken chargers and bad charging software surprise. More

1063
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,440
Speaker 5:  importantly, the inflation reduction act was signed big

1064
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,440
Speaker 5:  climate bill, lots of EV text credit news. And that bill on

1065
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,360
Speaker 5:  the plus side, Tesla gets the credit again. They'd run out there only 200,000.

1066
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:49,320
Speaker 5:  So Tesla had run out ages ago. GM had run out. I

1067
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,880
Speaker 5:  think Ford was about to run out. They get it again. If the cars are made

1068
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,560
Speaker 5:  in north America, if the batteries are made in north America after I think

1069
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,280
Speaker 5:  20, 24. So that means like the Hyundai

1070
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:02,640
Speaker 5:  ionic five does not get the credit anymore. It's hard. It's confusing. Lots

1071
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,960
Speaker 5:  of freak outs in like various car forms about when you assign your contract.

1072
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,920
Speaker 5:  Because if you sign your contract, you, if you have a written contract before

1073
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,080
Speaker 5:  the date of the thing, you still get the credit. If you don't, you don't,

1074
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:14,280
Speaker 5:  Andy Hawkins is a great explainer about it, which walking through it,

1075
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,760
Speaker 5:  the really important piece of the puzzle though, is it's gonna push battery

1076
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,880
Speaker 5:  manufacturing to the United States because car makers need the batteries

1077
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:25,680
Speaker 5:  made here to get the credits, which I think is important. And the other

1078
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,920
Speaker 5:  important piece of the puzzle, because of this written contract requirement,

1079
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,880
Speaker 5:  all these like vaporware car pre-orders yes. Might go away.

1080
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:32,640
Speaker 7:  Yes.

1081
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:37,040
Speaker 5:  Which I think is super fascinating. Like knock on. I don't think anybody

1082
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,680
Speaker 5:  was anticipating that this would be the knock on effect, but if you need

1083
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,800
Speaker 5:  the contract before, like lucid is shifting from

1084
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,200
Speaker 5:  preorder reservations to written contracts now, because they gotta lock

1085
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,600
Speaker 5:  in the order to get people the credit before the,

1086
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:51,600
Speaker 7:  Oh man, they're gonna get,

1087
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,120
Speaker 5:  Or before the law goes

1088
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,680
Speaker 7:  Effect, it's pass. So if these companies that are like shifting so that they

1089
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:00,560
Speaker 7:  can make sure they get the money, don't ship the cars at a timely

1090
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,520
Speaker 7:  fashion. Can they get the hell suit out of 'em by the customers?

1091
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,120
Speaker 5:  I know it depends on what these, these written contracts.

1092
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:11,200
Speaker 7:  Oh my God, that's fine. Right? So the, I mean, not for the car makers, but

1093
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:15,360
Speaker 7:  like for me personally, I'm opposed to vaporware. Well,

1094
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,560
Speaker 5:  See the, the game around the credits is like,

1095
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:22,960
Speaker 5:  it's in a real limbo space right now. Like the law has

1096
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:26,080
Speaker 5:  passed. No one really knows what it means. There's lots of attempts to figure

1097
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,400
Speaker 5:  out what it means, how to get the credits at the same time. Ford right.

1098
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,240
Speaker 5:  7,500 credit comes back for them, cuz they're not gonna hit the cap

1099
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,760
Speaker 5:  anymore. They just raised the price of the truck by $8,000.

1100
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:39,120
Speaker 7:  Cool, cool. Nevermind. I hate this. This is terrible.

1101
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:43,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So go read that explainer. If you are in the market for a car like

1102
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,600
Speaker 5:  me and you can't find a car to buy like me, it's good. It's very helpful.

1103
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,000
Speaker 5:  He, Andy definitely wrote the explainer cuz I was like, I don't what to do.

1104
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:54,400
Speaker 5:  So thank you, Andy. And then last we have to call this one out

1105
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:58,840
Speaker 5:  Dodge, dear suite Dodge, part of the FCA Solanis

1106
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:01,960
Speaker 5:  worldwide conglomerate of car manufacturers.

1107
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:07,240
Speaker 5:  They put out their first EV concept. So charger EV sick.

1108
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,720
Speaker 5:  It has a fake exhaust sound. Like they were like muscle car buyers,

1109
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,720
Speaker 5:  want loud cars. So we just put speakers in this

1110
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,480
Speaker 5:  car that make it make loud sounds. And

1111
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,320
Speaker 6:  It's the best. It's the best loud sound.

1112
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:25,880
Speaker 5:  Andy Hawkins. When he wrote about it said it sounds like a line getting neutered.

1113
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,160
Speaker 5:  And I think that is exactly right.

1114
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:28,920
Speaker 6:  It's pretty good.

1115
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:30,520
Speaker 5:  It's

1116
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:30,680
Speaker 7:  Very

1117
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,800
Speaker 5:  Accurate. Something else.

1118
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,200
Speaker 5:  They're calling it a battery electric vehicle exhaust noise.

1119
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,320
Speaker 7:  Can you turn it off?

1120
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:39,360
Speaker 5:  It's I don't know.

1121
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,280
Speaker 7:  I think somebody like is testing it at 2:00 AM outside my window

1122
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:44,760
Speaker 7:  lately. I think I'm hearing it a lot.

1123
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:49,640
Speaker 5:  The name is called the frat Sonic chambered

1124
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:53,560
Speaker 5:  exhaust. No. What? Which can reach 126 decibels

1125
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,360
Speaker 5:  making it as loud as a hell. Cat powered Dutch.

1126
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:01,400
Speaker 6:  And am I, am I wrong for thinking that an exhaust is not

1127
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,920
Speaker 6:  a thing that needs to exist on an electric vehicle? Am I crazy?

1128
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:08,440
Speaker 5:  It's just speakers. Okay. I don't know what to tell you.

1129
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:12,320
Speaker 5:  It is not an exhaust. It is just a button marked mega.

1130
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:16,520
Speaker 7:  It is legit. Just somebody going as they drive down the road. Yep.

1131
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,080
Speaker 7:  But with a really good speaker.

1132
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:21,360
Speaker 6:  So instead of flipping up and hitting NAS, you hit the speakers.

1133
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:26,160
Speaker 5:  And then also if you've ever driven, EV you know, they don't

1134
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:30,010
Speaker 5:  have transmissions cuz they they're just electric motors.

1135
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:34,790
Speaker 5:  The cool part of driving EV is like the instant torque at

1136
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:38,470
Speaker 5:  every part of whatever Dodge decided muscle car buyers

1137
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:42,510
Speaker 5:  need a transmission. So they've added a transmission. I'm not

1138
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:46,310
Speaker 5:  sure how it works, cuz it it's like a confusing idea in an electric

1139
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:50,150
Speaker 5:  car. So we'll see how it works. But they've given it a

1140
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:53,350
Speaker 5:  name and the name is lowercase E yes.

1141
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:57,470
Speaker 5:  R lowercase E I love it. And the name is lowercase E

1142
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,310
Speaker 5:  capital letter, R U P T or erupt?

1143
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:03,990
Speaker 6:  No, it's it's erupt.

1144
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:09,070
Speaker 6:  What

1145
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:09,870
Speaker 7:  If it's just like a game?

1146
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:12,510
Speaker 6:  What do you think? VIN diesel thinks that's all I find myself wondering right

1147
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:15,630
Speaker 6:  now is like, did, did van diesel get in the driver's seat to one of those

1148
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:19,390
Speaker 6:  and go, this feels right? Like, is that, is that I just wanna know.

1149
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:23,070
Speaker 7:  I hope it's in the next fast and furious movie and he is like, it could be

1150
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:26,430
Speaker 7:  louder. And like part of the movie is them just trying to make it as loud

1151
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:29,990
Speaker 7:  as possible. Well, he gets really good at the, the gear shifting game.

1152
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:34,310
Speaker 5:  I'm just gonna read you this last paragraph from the CNBC piece KCU

1153
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,350
Speaker 5:  he's the CEO of Dodge said some of the design elements and technologies are

1154
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:42,350
Speaker 5:  expected to impact the range of the vehicle, but it's not something

1155
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:46,150
Speaker 5:  Dodge is worried about. And then quote, I don't care. It's

1156
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,030
Speaker 5:  badass. It's a muscle car.

1157
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,700
Speaker 7:  That's right. That's that's what muscle car owners feel.

1158
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:57,180
Speaker 5:  Yeah, you gotta, you gotta hit the mega base button to go five

1159
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,700
Speaker 5:  miles on charge. It's

1160
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,220
Speaker 6:  Good. I've been thinking that it's, it's a real bummer that with electric

1161
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:05,820
Speaker 6:  vehicles, the world is gonna get quieter. So I'm really glad Dodge is out

1162
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,260
Speaker 6:  here trying to solve that problem for us.

1163
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:10,660
Speaker 5:  It's just a concept. No idea when it will ship.

1164
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:14,580
Speaker 7:  I do like the gear shifting thing. That's fun. Like I was just reading

1165
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,600
Speaker 7:  a story the other day from somebody about like how gear shifting is going

1166
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:21,960
Speaker 7:  away and it's not gonna, like, it's gonna be a lost art

1167
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:25,880
Speaker 7:  and these, these EV owners you'll be able to hear them coming and you'll

1168
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,880
Speaker 7:  be like a heck guy, Alex,

1169
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:30,520
Speaker 5:  Let me ask you straight up. Do you know how to ride a horse? Yes. You're

1170
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,480
Speaker 5:  from Texas. Are you, are you an equestrian of anything?

1171
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,520
Speaker 7:  I mean, I've ridden a horse one time. I rode it a gal. Yeah.

1172
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,400
Speaker 5:  I've ridden a horse too. Would you say you knew how to ride a horse?

1173
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,760
Speaker 7:  I feel like it's not hard. You just like get up there, but it's different.

1174
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:44,760
Speaker 6:  That's a no, from

1175
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,960
Speaker 5:  That once upon a time, someone was like riding a horse is a lost art.

1176
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:52,960
Speaker 5:  That's just where we are. Like the, the American

1177
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,320
Speaker 5:  unicycle Alliance was like, these cars gonna replace uni

1178
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:57,360
Speaker 7:  The part unicycle.

1179
01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:00,800
Speaker 6:  This also sounds like they're gonna just put a joystick in the middle of

1180
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,160
Speaker 6:  the car that does nothing. Yes.

1181
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,280
Speaker 7:  But that's the best part.

1182
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:05,440
Speaker 6:  Make some rumbling noises every time you move.

1183
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,280
Speaker 7:  I hope it changes

1184
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,120
Speaker 6:  The audio. It's gonna make a bunch of people really happy.

1185
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:09,880
Speaker 7:  They're gonna

1186
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:15,400
Speaker 5:  All, let's try this up. The lighting round and runs erupted.

1187
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,760
Speaker 5:  It's horrible. Lots of stuff in line around David, what you got,

1188
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:23,480
Speaker 6:  We're definitely getting an explicit tag on this podcast.

1189
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:29,040
Speaker 6:  I, the thing that jumped out to me the most was snap giving up on the

1190
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,960
Speaker 6:  pixie drone. Aw. After, after just four months, this thing feels

1191
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,680
Speaker 6:  like it just shipped 15 minutes ago because it basically just did.

1192
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:40,800
Speaker 6:  And the it's kind of a sign of the times,

1193
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:44,320
Speaker 6:  like it's, it's a tough economy. Everybody is sort of pulling back and finding

1194
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,640
Speaker 6:  ways to cut down on spending. And like, I don't think anyone thought the,

1195
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:51,760
Speaker 6:  the pixie drone was gonna be a huge revenue driver for snap anytime soon.

1196
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:56,040
Speaker 6:  But if it's indicative of what this next phase is gonna look like,

1197
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,520
Speaker 6:  where I think a lot of companies are gonna pull back on anything that feels

1198
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,400
Speaker 6:  sort of extraneous as a person who likes gadgets and

1199
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,400
Speaker 6:  technology and new things, it just kind of makes me sad. And I think we're,

1200
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,000
Speaker 6:  we're gonna get a lot of companies investing in like a very small number

1201
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:11,960
Speaker 6:  of relatively uninteresting things and trying to figure out how to

1202
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,000
Speaker 6:  monetize all the stuff you already use and spending less time

1203
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:19,960
Speaker 6:  in the very near future, trying to invent new stuff. And I kind of think

1204
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:23,080
Speaker 6:  that's a bummer. I was never gonna buy a pixie drone, but it's the kind of

1205
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,960
Speaker 6:  thing that like, I like that it exists. And I like that snap is the kind

1206
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,480
Speaker 6:  of company that makes this stuff. So it's just a bummer to see it give up

1207
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:29,840
Speaker 6:  so fast.

1208
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:33,400
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I, I think the flip side of that is one of the big companies

1209
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:37,720
Speaker 5:  look inward in that way. It just creates a lot of

1210
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,400
Speaker 5:  opportunity for other companies to make interesting things and not worry

1211
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:45,040
Speaker 5:  that, you know, we are gonna make a camera drone and then like

1212
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,800
Speaker 5:  Facebook will make one and kills. Yeah. And so I'm hopeful that there's a

1213
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,720
Speaker 5:  little bit of that dynamic in the future where you see the smaller companies

1214
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:55,040
Speaker 5:  do interesting things, cuz it's easier to differentiate when you know, the

1215
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,960
Speaker 5:  big companies are focused on monetizing app.

1216
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,480
Speaker 6:  That's fair. I think that's, I think that's right. And I hope that is true,

1217
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,680
Speaker 6:  but I do think there is a decent chance we're headed into a weird

1218
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:09,840
Speaker 6:  time for hardware. Like supply chain stuff continues to be wonky.

1219
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,760
Speaker 6:  Hardware is hard and expensive. There's like people are buying less and less

1220
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,600
Speaker 6:  of that stuff. So I, I'm gonna be curious to see what the next like

1221
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:21,200
Speaker 6:  12 to 24 months looks like in terms of interesting new hardware.

1222
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:25,510
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Okay. Here's my line around one. It's very good. This is a

1223
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:29,390
Speaker 5:  journalism story in its core, like a perfect journalism story.

1224
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:33,750
Speaker 5:  So there's this platform called trier, which you probably

1225
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,750
Speaker 5:  don't know about. It's a TikTok clone run America. They're doing okay.

1226
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:41,510
Speaker 5:  They like raised a bunch of money. They caught some audience. The Dios are

1227
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:42,310
Speaker 5:  involved in some way.

1228
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:46,830
Speaker 6:  Do you guys remember when all the TikTok Trump stuff was happening? And there

1229
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:46,950
Speaker 6:  was,

1230
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:47,630
Speaker 5:  Was like,

1231
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:52,350
Speaker 6:  Come to us, like's gonna die. Were the new TikTok let's go.

1232
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:55,990
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And so they raised a bunch of money that time. They spent some of that

1233
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:59,710
Speaker 5:  money on versa, which was a pandemic sensation

1234
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:03,310
Speaker 5:  run by Timbaland and Swiss beats who are megastar hiphop. It's still good.

1235
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:07,230
Speaker 5:  I can't, if you don't, I can't believe I explained don't you don't need to,

1236
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:10,950
Speaker 5:  if you're listening to this, then you don't know Tim like go educate yourselves.

1237
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:16,430
Speaker 5:  I mean, they like created the sound of like at least a decade and a half.

1238
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:20,830
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So they paid and they had sold versa. They had licensed

1239
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:24,790
Speaker 5:  it like apple music was streaming versa. It was just them calling their famous

1240
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:28,750
Speaker 5:  musician friends together. And like they would play their songs at each other

1241
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:31,590
Speaker 5:  and talk shit. Yes. And it was great. It was like, it was great. Incredible.

1242
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:35,270
Speaker 5:  It was like, it's really fun to watch. So they sold it to versa.

1243
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:39,870
Speaker 5:  They sold it trier or they sold, they sold. Yeah. They sold versa

1244
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:43,990
Speaker 5:  to trier. And now they're suing trier cuz they say trier owes them

1245
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:47,910
Speaker 5:  28 million and never paid to, to date. Defendants

1246
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:50,830
Speaker 5:  trier have failed and refused to any payment to Timberland and Swiss beats

1247
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:53,710
Speaker 5:  for the past two sums blah blah, blah. Right.

1248
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,550
Speaker 5:  Great trier. This is the journalism story part. So that's very funny cuz

1249
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:02,510
Speaker 5:  you know, upstart social platform with no real money, forgot to pay the

1250
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:05,950
Speaker 5:  superstar about producers, funny as face. So we report on this, we get the

1251
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:09,790
Speaker 5:  lawsuit rather complete. We asked trier for a statement.

1252
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:13,910
Speaker 5:  So Mr. Off, who's on asked trier for statement. They reply

1253
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:16,070
Speaker 5:  from an account. That's just like press@triller.com.

1254
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:21,390
Speaker 5:  And it's like, the statement is just on its face. Like not like hilarious.

1255
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:25,230
Speaker 5:  We do not wish to air our dirty laundry in the press, but we have paid SW

1256
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:28,470
Speaker 5:  to millions in cash in stock. No one has benefited mushroom Triller to date

1257
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:32,150
Speaker 5:  Triller helped fuel versus to new Heights, which is just not true. It was

1258
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:35,550
Speaker 5:  already at the Heights like apple music is streaming. The thing it's already,

1259
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:39,590
Speaker 5:  it was already a global cultural phenomenon before sch showed up and they

1260
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:43,470
Speaker 5:  said we made it whatever we hope it's just a misunderstanding. So

1261
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:46,630
Speaker 5:  then we have this background policy where we don't now allow unnamed PR people.

1262
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:49,890
Speaker 5:  So email back, this has to be on the record.

1263
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:54,160
Speaker 5:  She gets even longer statement, which is like,

1264
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:58,320
Speaker 5:  you can just read it. It's very long for it's like randomly capitalized.

1265
01:13:58,540 --> 01:13:59,240
Speaker 5:  The whole thing.

1266
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:04,840
Speaker 5:  We think it's a legal shakedown. They have not delivered

1267
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:08,120
Speaker 5:  any episodes of versa. We think their lawyers are over zealous,

1268
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:13,400
Speaker 5:  whatever. It's just like, ah, it's the random capitals are really good. No,

1269
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:16,520
Speaker 5:  no sign though. They still haven't signed it. It came from a different email

1270
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:20,370
Speaker 5:  address from outlook.com and at the bottom it

1271
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,250
Speaker 5:  just says, Ryan

1272
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:27,130
Speaker 5:  trier co-founder is stamped Ryan Kavanaugh. So he just like reply

1273
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:30,490
Speaker 5:  like, is this is this you? And they just stopped

1274
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:33,650
Speaker 5:  responding. So we put up this story, we're like, here's what happened? Like

1275
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:37,210
Speaker 5:  here's the sourcing tribute to what you will, we're try to transferring about

1276
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:41,170
Speaker 5:  this. So then they responded yesterday with

1277
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:44,850
Speaker 5:  another version of the second statement, elevating the amount paid to

1278
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:46,530
Speaker 5:  55. Now they're claiming 55

1279
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:51,930
Speaker 5:  billion. Now they're saying this statement can be attributed to our CEO

1280
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:55,370
Speaker 5:  and chairman mahi DeSilva, which they

1281
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,370
Speaker 5:  misspelled, which is just perfect.

1282
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:05,730
Speaker 7:  You know, which like when you're out having a good time and you

1283
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:08,970
Speaker 7:  see, you need to respond to the email and you grab your phone and you have

1284
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:12,690
Speaker 7:  to push your drink aside and get it all spelled out. You'll have time

1285
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:14,650
Speaker 7:  to double check the day of your boss.

1286
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:19,530
Speaker 5:  I mean, it's just, it's like the whole time was like, oh, this is why I had

1287
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:20,130
Speaker 5:  this policy.

1288
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,730
Speaker 5:  Like we made all this noise about like having you on the record. It's like,

1289
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,770
Speaker 5:  because at the end of the day, it's, it's just someone foiling and

1290
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:33,290
Speaker 5:  I dunno, it's good. Hopefully Tim and SOS get paid. They're more important

1291
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:37,090
Speaker 5:  to our culture than thriller. That's that's my position. It's not a position

1292
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:40,010
Speaker 5:  of the verge.com, but I'm confident that if you pulled the staff of the verge.com

1293
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:43,130
Speaker 5:  and asked them who is more important to the culture, Timbaland and Swizz

1294
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:46,050
Speaker 5:  beats or thriller, they will agree with me. Yeah. It's pretty stressful.

1295
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:46,650
Speaker 5:  Encourage someone to

1296
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:48,650
Speaker 7:  What if they misunderstand it as thriller?

1297
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:51,730
Speaker 5:  I think thrill thriller is more important to the culture than thriller

1298
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,890
Speaker 5:  name a Michael Jackson song that is less important to the culture than,

1299
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:57,770
Speaker 5:  than thriller. And you

1300
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:59,130
Speaker 7:  Cannot do it. No, it's impossible.

1301
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:01,930
Speaker 5:  All right, Alex, what you got?

1302
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:06,610
Speaker 7:  So Jess weathered, who's one of our new news writers. She's based out in

1303
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:10,370
Speaker 7:  the UK. She wrote about the absolute goofiest

1304
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:15,130
Speaker 7:  set of monitors that are just like two monitors stacked on top

1305
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:18,610
Speaker 7:  of each other and they just, just close up and, and

1306
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:22,410
Speaker 7:  somebody's just like, yep. This, these two very cheap

1307
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:25,850
Speaker 7:  crummy monitors cuz they're, they're both like 1440 P

1308
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:30,090
Speaker 7:  75 Hertz refresh 300 knits brightness. These are not

1309
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:34,170
Speaker 7:  super, super fancy, nice monitors. But I think like the

1310
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:38,010
Speaker 7:  gimmick is that they're on a cool stand so you can close them at the end

1311
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:41,930
Speaker 7:  of the day and then slowly open them up and they

1312
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,850
Speaker 7:  just crack me up. I just keep looking at like, there's a GIF in, in this

1313
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:49,650
Speaker 7:  story she wrote and it just keeps the guys just so happy to like just

1314
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,650
Speaker 7:  quietly open those monitors and appreciate his monitors. But

1315
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:57,730
Speaker 7:  it's called gems. There's two versions. There's gems. And there's the

1316
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:58,570
Speaker 7:  gems X.

1317
01:16:59,350 --> 01:16:59,570
Speaker 5:  Yes.

1318
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,930
Speaker 7:  That gives you 1440 P the gems is just 10 80 P at 60 Hertz,

1319
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:07,850
Speaker 7:  250 net brightness. These are like the hundred dollars

1320
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:11,960
Speaker 7:  monitors that you get when you buy like a Dell desktop

1321
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:16,000
Speaker 7:  from 1998. It's those monitors. And they've just

1322
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,920
Speaker 7:  like, I mean, I don't know if it's actually those monitors caveat. It may

1323
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,840
Speaker 7:  not be those specific monitors, but it's basically those monitors just

1324
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,800
Speaker 7:  like, and you just open it up and I just really appreciate Jess is out there

1325
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,400
Speaker 7:  writing about it,

1326
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:32,320
Speaker 6:  But like they didn't even do anything to them. Yep. They just added hinge

1327
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:36,040
Speaker 6:  the back. Like they just put two of them together, like super door hinge

1328
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:36,520
Speaker 6:  and that's it.

1329
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:40,600
Speaker 5:  You gotta look, read the story and look at the gift of this dude, opening

1330
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:44,880
Speaker 5:  this monitor. It is incredible. I dunno how to describe this to you.

1331
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:46,680
Speaker 6:  It's fantastic.

1332
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:50,240
Speaker 7:  It's stacked as, as the, the video says,

1333
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,200
Speaker 5:  I mean just the, he's got a, he's got a big, you know, top gun mustache.

1334
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:57,800
Speaker 5:  He's got long hair and he's just grinning at unfolding this honor.

1335
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:58,640
Speaker 5:  It's very good.

1336
01:17:58,870 --> 01:17:59,520
Speaker 7:  It's very good.

1337
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:03,640
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Nothing says it's time to go to work. Like unfoldings

1338
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:04,720
Speaker 7:  Well, it's it's crowdfunded.

1339
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,480
Speaker 5:  I don't care what she said. It's crowdfunded.

1340
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:08,360
Speaker 7:  So you might be better off. Just go buying too.

1341
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:11,520
Speaker 5:  I'm I'm crowdfunding the whole thing. What's the goal. Is it $10? I'll give

1342
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:11,880
Speaker 5:  it to him,

1343
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,520
Speaker 7:  But it's incredible. I love it.

1344
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:19,080
Speaker 5:  That's great. All right, David, last one. I need you to explain to me what's

1345
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,560
Speaker 5:  going on in sports streaming. Cause it sounds like we have to care about

1346
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,520
Speaker 5:  peacock now. Disclosure,

1347
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:27,880
Speaker 5:  NBC universals investor in Fox media. But I feel like I just said, we have

1348
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:31,000
Speaker 5:  to pay attention to peacock. Now you should understand the tenor of that

1349
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:31,720
Speaker 5:  relationship. Go ahead,

1350
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,560
Speaker 6:  David. We also made a show for Netflix, but that's not important to this

1351
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,400
Speaker 6:  particular discussion.

1352
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:39,200
Speaker 5:  Yes, my good friend and co-founder works at Google. What more do you want

1353
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:39,520
Speaker 5:  for me?

1354
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,800
Speaker 6:  Most of you should stop listening now because this explanation takes four

1355
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:49,480
Speaker 6:  and a half hours. Basically the big 10, which is a big

1356
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:49,840
Speaker 6:  sports

1357
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:50,440
Speaker 7:  College,

1358
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:51,880
Speaker 5:  Many more than 10 property

1359
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:52,600
Speaker 6:  Teams.

1360
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:58,200
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There's like 35 teams in the bid. Like half of college teams

1361
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:02,160
Speaker 6:  in America are somehow in the big 10 now, but basically they signed this

1362
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,840
Speaker 6:  big new deal for their streaming rights is $8 billion of the next seven

1363
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:10,120
Speaker 6:  years. And these are the moments where basically

1364
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,680
Speaker 6:  all of these leagues and conferences and whoever get to decide

1365
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:17,720
Speaker 6:  like what we want the future to look like. So like I personally care a lot

1366
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,920
Speaker 6:  about these because they decide a lot about what the near future of television

1367
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,440
Speaker 6:  is gonna look like. And the big 10 picked like a

1368
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:28,920
Speaker 6:  real sucky way to do it. As far as I'm concerned for the future, they basically,

1369
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:32,760
Speaker 6:  they, they divvied games up between NBC, CBS, and Fox. Some of them

1370
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:36,440
Speaker 6:  will stream some of them won't it's total chaos. What's gonna be where there's

1371
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,520
Speaker 6:  also the big 10 network, which will have some games. Peacock just randomly

1372
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,680
Speaker 6:  gets eight games that aren't gonna be anywhere else. Like this is just not,

1373
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:44,000
Speaker 7:  Are they gonna make an app?

1374
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,720
Speaker 6:  This is just not a good system. And it's like, like

1375
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:50,200
Speaker 7:  An app to just, no, the big 10, the big 10, this is

1376
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:52,200
Speaker 6:  Who's gonna make an app. There's

1377
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:52,840
Speaker 5:  There's you see one

1378
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:56,800
Speaker 6:  App for the big 12 apps, the big 10. So the big 10 has the big 10 network

1379
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:00,640
Speaker 6:  and that will have some games. You would think that if you got the big 10

1380
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,360
Speaker 6:  network and paid what it costs, no, that you would be able to watch all the

1381
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,880
Speaker 6:  big 10 games on the big 10 network. You'd be wrong

1382
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:11,240
Speaker 6:  because this is the world that we live in. And then it's like, we're just,

1383
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:14,360
Speaker 6:  we're just in this place where sports dictate how all of this stuff works

1384
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:17,600
Speaker 6:  because that's where all the money is. And the big 10 at least is still making

1385
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,160
Speaker 6:  this gigantic bet that cable TV is gonna keep mattering for a long time.

1386
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:23,960
Speaker 6:  Which was very funny because the other thing that also happened today was

1387
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,640
Speaker 6:  there was a study released that said streaming more people

1388
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:31,560
Speaker 6:  watched streaming TV than watched linear TV for the first time ever.

1389
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:35,640
Speaker 6:  So like, this is, this is a, a thing running

1390
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,720
Speaker 6:  against the actual trend of where the world is going, but there's still a

1391
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,320
Speaker 6:  lot of money in selling your stuff to, well,

1392
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:40,840
Speaker 7:  Don't worry. NBC

1393
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:41,280
Speaker 6:  Broadcast

1394
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,880
Speaker 7:  Channel it's coming. It's gonna change everything.

1395
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:48,560
Speaker 7:  Streaming is streaming. You're looking down a barrel. It's almost

1396
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:48,840
Speaker 7:  over.

1397
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,120
Speaker 5:  I feel like the phrase you're looking down a barrel is less threatening than

1398
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:55,880
Speaker 5:  the actual cliche. What

1399
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,000
Speaker 7:  Cliche? What is the actual cliche? No, it's not. What

1400
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:01,800
Speaker 5:  Is it? It's the barrel of a gun. Yeah, you're looking like just a like,

1401
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:04,800
Speaker 5:  oh yeah. Someone looking at a barrel is not inherently

1402
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:07,920
Speaker 7:  Threatening. I was thinking, I was thinking of the gun when I said it. I

1403
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,040
Speaker 7:  just didn't wanna, you know, a economy of words.

1404
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:14,320
Speaker 5:  Oh look a barrel. You're looking at a barrel.

1405
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:20,680
Speaker 7:  Well, they're not, they're not, they're not winning at broadcast television.

1406
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,840
Speaker 7:  If they're looking at a barrel, they're too busy. That's true. They're very

1407
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,080
Speaker 7:  busy.

1408
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:28,080
Speaker 5:  If you don't get your shit together, you'll be looking at a barrel.

1409
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,520
Speaker 5:  I mean, in a way it works.

1410
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,560
Speaker 7:  That's how I start all my threats. Now

1411
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:34,200
Speaker 6:  That's intense.

1412
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:35,600
Speaker 7:  I'm hide.

1413
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:42,680
Speaker 5:  All right, we'll come back next week. We'll do a full hour on FireWire

1414
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,680
Speaker 5:  800. What happens next?

1415
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:46,240
Speaker 7:  It also looked at a barrel

1416
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:49,640
Speaker 5:  In ATSC 3.0 it did look at a barrel.

1417
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:52,040
Speaker 5:  He got all the way in the barrel.

1418
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:56,680
Speaker 5:  All right, that's it. That's the, Vergecast the Wednesday show this week.

1419
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:01,640
Speaker 5:  Really fun earbuds test. I will say we got an email about the earbuds test.

1420
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,200
Speaker 5:  David. The email was titled Jaybird's erasure,

1421
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:09,600
Speaker 5:  which was not an email about the band erasure on

1422
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,720
Speaker 5:  Jaybird headphones. So you gotta take care of that.

1423
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:16,480
Speaker 6:  Ne can I tell you there's a reason for that? It's because I forgot that J

1424
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:20,400
Speaker 6:  bird exists as a company. JBU has not made a pair

1425
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,080
Speaker 6:  of headphones in like three years, but I used to love my

1426
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:27,320
Speaker 6:  Jaybirds and we will, we will bring Jor back right

1427
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:31,280
Speaker 5:  With Highwire I'm and broadcast television. Very good. That was really fun.

1428
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:35,000
Speaker 5:  David and I talked about the F150 lightning. What was the third thing? I

1429
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,040
Speaker 5:  should probably just scroll up and read it.

1430
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,520
Speaker 6:  We answered a bunch of people's questions about in green Oxys. It's good

1431
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:40,720
Speaker 6:  stuff.

1432
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,240
Speaker 5:  I love taking the calls. What's the number to call in

1433
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:47,120
Speaker 6:  Green bubbles. Eight sixty six verge. One, one. It is absolutely my favorite

1434
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,560
Speaker 6:  thing about the Vergecast like, I love both of you, but it's way more fun.

1435
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:53,680
Speaker 6:  Talking to the people who call the hotline. So eight sixty six version one,

1436
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:54,120
Speaker 6:  one, call us, ask all your

1437
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:57,960
Speaker 5:  Questions. Bunch of stories on site. James Vincent has

1438
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:01,840
Speaker 5:  a big scoop about crypto.com laying off people, and then quietly laying off

1439
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,960
Speaker 5:  hundreds of more people. Justine, actually bunch of cryp itself. Justine

1440
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,840
Speaker 5:  has a story about carbon offsets for crypto. Then we got a
