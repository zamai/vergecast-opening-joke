Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, David Pierce, and Alex Cranz discuss Apple announcing it will support RCS next year, AI news that came out of Microsoft Ignite, YouTube's new policy on deepfakes, and much more.

2
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:25,635
Speaker 4:  Hello and Welcome To, our cast, the flagship podcast of

3
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:28,835
Speaker 4:  Interoperable messaging standards. Yeah, I mean it really is

4
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:32,515
Speaker 4:  honest. If you look at the Apple Podcast catalog, you look at the whole thing

5
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:35,315
Speaker 4:  and you're like, which one of these is the flagship podcast of interoperable

6
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:38,915
Speaker 4:  messaging standards? We have a strong a claim to that.

7
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,315
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Is anything, it's not the Ezra Klein show.

8
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:47,155
Speaker 5:  I also, the podcast world needs this the like ultra specific like net

9
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:50,995
Speaker 5:  Netflix style genre stuff that exists. Like I want that for podcasts

10
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:54,875
Speaker 5:  where it's like I wanna listen to a podcast exclusively about how

11
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:58,755
Speaker 5:  the DMA will affect a messaging app that no one in Europe uses

12
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:01,675
Speaker 5:  and that we had a big fight about in Slack. And it just like, there it is.

13
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:05,675
Speaker 4:  This is the future of AI, is you pick your celebrities and you pick your

14
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:09,395
Speaker 4:  topic and you just sort of get it like during the podcast, boom. Casey

15
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:13,075
Speaker 4:  Newton once said to me, the problem with this market is that you can pick

16
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:16,755
Speaker 4:  literally any two celebrities and they have interviewed each other on a podcast.

17
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:19,995
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And you gotta break through that. And I was like, All, right? I'm gonna

18
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:23,515
Speaker 4:  ask nerds about decisions and no one is gonna have done that before,

19
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,715
Speaker 4:  but I, this is what AI is for. You want to get Dax Shepherd, Bree

20
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:31,715
Speaker 4:  Larsson and Bree Larsson. Yes. Just head to head on RCS.

21
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:32,115
Speaker 4:  I

22
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:33,035
Speaker 2:  Would listen for hours.

23
00:02:33,465 --> 00:02:36,475
Speaker 4:  Copyright be damned. Alright. There is quite a lot to talk about. We are

24
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:39,675
Speaker 4:  starting in the midst of breaking news. Apple is gonna adopt RCS next year.

25
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:42,915
Speaker 4:  That is in the context of massive amounts of European regulation. We gotta

26
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:46,795
Speaker 4:  talk about all of that. We got clips to run. I've threatened to complain

27
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:50,595
Speaker 4:  about USBC in this context, but I won't explain how or why to my co-hosts.

28
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:54,595
Speaker 4:  They look scared when I said that The Epic versus Google trial is

29
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:58,755
Speaker 4:  ongoing. Google versus do OJ is ongoing. Microsoft had an

30
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:01,285
Speaker 4:  AI conference and then we got a lightning round. Yep. Then there's like Taylor,

31
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:05,205
Speaker 4:  Swift fans are using huge amounts of data all over the place. A

32
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:09,165
Speaker 4:  jam packed show. What happened? And then on top of it for the

33
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:13,045
Speaker 4:  YouTube audience, we're gonna look at some formula for wearable success

34
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:17,045
Speaker 4:  graphs after the credits. Because I don don't think that makes for

35
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:20,445
Speaker 4:  compelling radio. I re, I went and listened to that conversation from last

36
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:24,245
Speaker 4:  week and I was like, this is some of the worst radio. Someone

37
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:27,725
Speaker 4:  doing bad algebra and then trying to describe a graph.

38
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:31,325
Speaker 4:  Again, this is what AI is for. It's like you could ask an AI for that podcast

39
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:33,525
Speaker 4:  and the AI like Bing will be like, no, we could

40
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:37,365
Speaker 6:  Have had Deck Shepherd AI do that and we didn't missed opportunity.

41
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:41,125
Speaker 4:  Chad GBT is like, I'm sorry, that's against the rules. I won't let you make

42
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,245
Speaker 4:  a chemical weapon and I won't let you describe graphs

43
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:44,645
Speaker 6:  Via Dex Shepherd.

44
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:48,285
Speaker 4:  Via Dex Shepherd All. right. Let's start breaking news before we start the

45
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:51,605
Speaker 4:  show. Apple put out a statement a a weird statement in a weird way.

46
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:56,645
Speaker 4:  Unsigned statement to nine to five Mac I don. Nine to five Mac is

47
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:59,845
Speaker 4:  great. Yeah. I'm just saying it's a weird, weird approach to announcing this

48
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:02,285
Speaker 4:  news, but the Apple put out a statement attributed to no one, to nine to

49
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:05,125
Speaker 4:  five Mac. We trust nine to five Mac. It's great. We've asked for formal attribution

50
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:09,045
Speaker 4:  but Apple is going to adopt RCS next year.

51
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:09,605
Speaker 4:  Next

52
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:11,845
Speaker 6:  Year. That was very, very explicit in the statement.

53
00:04:11,905 --> 00:04:12,845
Speaker 4:  You got the statement, what does it

54
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:16,085
Speaker 6:  Say? I do have the statement. They said later next year we'll be adding support

55
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:20,125
Speaker 6:  for RCS Universal profile. The standard is currently published by the

56
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:24,165
Speaker 6:  GSM Association. We believe RCS Universal profile will offer

57
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:27,845
Speaker 6:  a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS.

58
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:29,685
Speaker 4:  It's fair. It's true. Yeah.

59
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:33,525
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that's true. This will work alongside iMessage, which

60
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:37,365
Speaker 6:  will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple

61
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:37,725
Speaker 6:  users.

62
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:39,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah, okay.

63
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:43,205
Speaker 5:  Sure. So there is what that statement says and then there is what

64
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:47,045
Speaker 5:  a lot of people want that statement to mean and we should

65
00:04:47,475 --> 00:04:51,085
Speaker 5:  peel apart the difference between those two things. Yeah. 'cause it's very

66
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:54,165
Speaker 5:  important what that statement says is that

67
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:58,525
Speaker 5:  Apple's Messages app on the iPhone and presumably other devices because

68
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:03,005
Speaker 5:  Apple has messages app on other devices will support

69
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:04,165
Speaker 5:  RCS messages.

70
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:08,645
Speaker 4:  Well RCS universal profile messages fair. Yeah.

71
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,245
Speaker 4:  Also an important distinction.

72
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:14,205
Speaker 5:  Yes. That's very good. What that doesn't mean is that the

73
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:18,125
Speaker 5:  blue bubble, green bubble thing is over and that Apple is now

74
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:22,285
Speaker 5:  integrating RCS into iMessage or integrating iMessage into RCS.

75
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:25,325
Speaker 5:  It in fact means precisely not that

76
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:27,485
Speaker 6:  Like

77
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:31,325
Speaker 5:  And and it's just like, I just, I just wanna put that out there. Like what

78
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:35,205
Speaker 5:  this means is that Green Bubbles will now send

79
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:39,165
Speaker 5:  messages that presumably include full

80
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:42,845
Speaker 5:  resolution photos and videos, which they have not before. Huge victory.

81
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:46,605
Speaker 5:  Possibly the only thing that it means, it also means they're encrypted. It's

82
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,925
Speaker 5:  be like it's a better protocol than SMS in all ways. Well,

83
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:52,125
Speaker 4:  But no, no. Even that possibly not. The only thing, like we don't know about

84
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,405
Speaker 4:  the encryption, RCS encryption is a long

85
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:57,525
Speaker 4:  winding complicated road. True.

86
00:05:57,665 --> 00:06:01,365
Speaker 6:  I'm hung up on the fact that it says very specifically, this will work alongside

87
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,005
Speaker 6:  iMessage.

88
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:06,205
Speaker 4:  Right. So let's put this whole thing into context and then unpack

89
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:09,845
Speaker 4:  it. Yes, please. Because Apple has been dragged to this kicking and

90
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:13,525
Speaker 4:  screaming. They have not wanted to do this. The European Union

91
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:17,605
Speaker 4:  is essentially forcing them into a position where they have to do it.

92
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:22,005
Speaker 4:  I will say the European Union is not making them do it. Yeah. Right. So there,

93
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:25,805
Speaker 4:  there's like a lot of unwinding to to unpack there. But let's start

94
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:28,645
Speaker 4:  with Apple doesn't want to do this and I think the best evidence we have

95
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:32,325
Speaker 4:  of Apple not wanting to do this is Tim Cook at the code conference,

96
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:37,045
Speaker 4:  not this past code conference, but the one before where he answered a question

97
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:41,165
Speaker 4:  about RCS by telling the person to buy their mom an iPhone.

98
00:06:41,545 --> 00:06:44,485
Speaker 4:  We, we have the clip, it's our clip, it's our conference. Can we, can we

99
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:45,525
Speaker 4:  run the code conference clip?

100
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:49,685
Speaker 7:  How do you think Steve would feel about adapting RCS risk communication systems

101
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:51,685
Speaker 7:  that would normalize and streamline that?

102
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:54,805
Speaker 8:  Tim, can you bring peace to the phone wars?

103
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:59,805
Speaker 9:  He always told me not to, to wonder what he would've

104
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:03,645
Speaker 9:  thought just to do the right thing. I don't hear

105
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:08,285
Speaker 9:  our users asking that, that we put a lot of

106
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:09,525
Speaker 9:  energy in on that at this point.

107
00:07:12,705 --> 00:07:13,165
Speaker 9:  And so

108
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:18,485
Speaker 9:  now I would love to always continue. I would love to convert you to

109
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:19,765
Speaker 9:  iPhone.

110
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:24,445
Speaker 9:  Okay.

111
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:28,165
Speaker 7:  It's just, it's a, it's tough not to make it personal, but I can't send my

112
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:31,325
Speaker 7:  mom certain videos or she can't see me certain videos and so we leave her

113
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:32,845
Speaker 9:  Buy your mom an iPhone

114
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:38,525
Speaker 4:  The glee with which he said Buy your mom an iPhone. He was

115
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:38,965
Speaker 6:  So happy.

116
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:43,325
Speaker 4:  I mean he had it, he had it in chamber and he fired that gun. He was ready.

117
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:47,565
Speaker 4:  So here's what I will offer you One, we ran that story. Tim Cook

118
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:48,605
Speaker 4:  says Buy a mom an iPhone.

119
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:52,205
Speaker 5:  This is barely over a year ago by the way. Yeah. Like it's, it's, it's useful

120
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:55,885
Speaker 5:  to say that this is not like eight years ago. Like we've been talking about

121
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:58,965
Speaker 5:  RCS for a long time and there have been proponents of RCS for a really long

122
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:02,805
Speaker 5:  time. This is not like generations ago thinking

123
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:06,165
Speaker 5:  of RCS. This is 14 months ago that Tim Cook said this

124
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:10,685
Speaker 4:  And our own Dieter bone before he went off to Google disclosure, Dieter

125
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:14,525
Speaker 4:  works or Google wrote pieces for us that are like the moral case for adopting

126
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:18,005
Speaker 4:  encrypted messaging because SMS in this country, especially

127
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:22,285
Speaker 4:  unencrypted stored on your carrier servers, totally accessible

128
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:26,045
Speaker 4:  to the police, to bad actors, to sold to data brokers.

129
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:29,925
Speaker 4:  There's a deep and abiding moral case for adopting an encrypted messaging

130
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:33,645
Speaker 4:  standard across all the carriers, across all the platforms. Apple just hasn't

131
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:36,445
Speaker 4:  done it and they've said use buy your mom an iPhone is what they've said.

132
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:40,925
Speaker 4:  So that has been their position and nothing has moved them off of

133
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:44,805
Speaker 4:  that position. Even a person saying to Tim Cook, my mom can't send any

134
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:48,205
Speaker 4:  videos. His answer has been go buy an iPhone. There are

135
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:52,965
Speaker 4:  documents and testimony and emails in the various trials

136
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:56,390
Speaker 4:  over the past few years around switching costs, costs particularly Epic versus

137
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,365
Speaker 4:  Apple where we have seen senior Apple executives argue about

138
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:04,285
Speaker 4:  opening up iMessage at AQ and Phil Schiller back and forth in some emails.

139
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:08,645
Speaker 4:  We should open this up. The response is no. If we open up

140
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:12,365
Speaker 4:  iMessage, people won't give their old iPhones to their kids. They might buy

141
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:16,165
Speaker 4:  cheaper Android devices. This is lock-in and they know it's

142
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:19,725
Speaker 4:  lock-in whether or not you wanna admit that it's lock-in Apple knows that

143
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,405
Speaker 4:  we have the emails from their executives. They know that

144
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:27,445
Speaker 4:  switching away from iMessage in the United States is really hard and it

145
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:31,365
Speaker 4:  keeps people on the iPhone. Fair enough. So the context for

146
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:35,045
Speaker 4:  all this is not the nothing which

147
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:37,845
Speaker 4:  I think nothing would really like it to be. And we can get to that. The context

148
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:41,205
Speaker 4:  for this is today the day we're recording this Thursday,

149
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:45,765
Speaker 4:  this is the deadline. Big companies have to file appeals to the

150
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:49,725
Speaker 4:  European Digital Markets Act, which would designate certain

151
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:54,005
Speaker 4:  services as gatekeepers and require them to be interoperable. So

152
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:58,085
Speaker 4:  iMessage might be one of those gatekeeper services. WhatsApp might be

153
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:00,885
Speaker 4:  one of those gatekeeper services. There's some rules you have to be so big,

154
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:04,725
Speaker 4:  have so many users make so much money. Okay? Like that's some

155
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:08,405
Speaker 4:  EU regulation. What it is not is a regulation that says Apple has to

156
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,605
Speaker 4:  adopt RCS or yet any regulation says Apple has to open up

157
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:16,285
Speaker 4:  iMessage. So what you can see is happening here is Apple's going to

158
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:20,245
Speaker 4:  appeal the gatekeeper status of iMessage, which they've already said

159
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,005
Speaker 4:  they're going to do. And as part of that appeal they're gonna say, look,

160
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:26,485
Speaker 4:  we adopted RCS, this interoperable potentially

161
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:29,885
Speaker 4:  encrypted standard that everyone else is using and we'll just have our own

162
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:33,165
Speaker 4:  thing on the side. That is my read. don don't think that Apple is doing this

163
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,805
Speaker 4:  outta the goodness of their heart. I think they're trying to protect iMessage

164
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:39,725
Speaker 4:  from European regulators and they're finally taking the out

165
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,485
Speaker 4:  of RCS. I think that's right.

166
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:45,525
Speaker 5:  Part of what's tricky about this is that what the DMA means

167
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:49,885
Speaker 5:  by interoperable kind of remains to be seen, right? Like we've heard

168
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:54,405
Speaker 5:  some rumblings that there's like code in the WhatsApp app that

169
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:57,885
Speaker 5:  suggests you might be able to see messages from other

170
00:10:58,245 --> 00:11:02,085
Speaker 5:  platforms inside of WhatsApp. Meta has been on this quest, or at least

171
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:05,685
Speaker 5:  was at one point on a quest to unify all of its messaging system

172
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:09,525
Speaker 5:  infrastructure across all the apps. So this question of like should

173
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:13,325
Speaker 5:  I be able to access all of my messaging apps from any of my messaging apps

174
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:17,365
Speaker 5:  is one version of what interoperable looks like. There's another version

175
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:21,325
Speaker 5:  of interoperable and I think this is what Apple would like the definition

176
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:25,205
Speaker 5:  to be that just says we all support a standard, it's

177
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:28,685
Speaker 5:  like email what we build around it is up to us

178
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:30,485
Speaker 4:  Or next to it. Yeah,

179
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:34,725
Speaker 5:  Whatever. But like Gmail has stuff that only works if you use Gmail,

180
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,885
Speaker 5:  but it's still a fully functional email client, right? Like that's, that

181
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:41,765
Speaker 5:  is a version of an interoperability story that you can tell. I

182
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:45,245
Speaker 5:  think there are a lot of correct concerns about what Gmail is doing to the

183
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:49,165
Speaker 5:  email ecosystem, but we'll leave that to the side. So this question of like

184
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:53,420
Speaker 5:  is the right answer that all of these messaging systems should be

185
00:11:53,565 --> 00:11:56,845
Speaker 5:  required to talk to each other? That's one thing and I think that's probably

186
00:11:56,845 --> 00:12:00,685
Speaker 5:  fairly unlikely. I think Apple thinks that

187
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:04,565
Speaker 5:  with this it can say we are now tapped into what everyone agrees

188
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:07,725
Speaker 5:  is the universal standard. We've done our job, this is interoperability,

189
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:09,605
Speaker 5:  leave us alone. There's

190
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:13,565
Speaker 6:  Just way it's just lacking in details. That's the thing I keep getting

191
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:17,285
Speaker 6:  hung up on is we don't know what the, the degree of that interoperability

192
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:21,205
Speaker 6:  is with iMessage. Right. Because it's alongside So that could mean

193
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:23,045
Speaker 6:  it's a whole other app technically. Yeah.

194
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,645
Speaker 4:  I don't know if it's Green Bubbles. Yeah. We, someone in our Slack when we

195
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,365
Speaker 4:  were talking about it suggested that it would be read, which is very good.

196
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:33,925
Speaker 4:  Like RCS messages show up as blood red bubbles and that

197
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:36,525
Speaker 4:  is just gonna get you to stop using it. Yeah. I think what you are gonna

198
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:39,165
Speaker 4:  get is some of the basics. You're gonna get high resolution photos, you will

199
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:43,085
Speaker 4:  get group chats that don't break amongst mixed devices

200
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:46,405
Speaker 4:  and mixed phones and over time,

201
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:48,365
Speaker 5:  I don't know if that's true. Yeah.

202
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:52,325
Speaker 4:  Right. Like you, it depends on how much, this is why I said the RCS universal

203
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:55,445
Speaker 4:  profile is an important part of this story. Especially because they've written

204
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:59,605
Speaker 4:  as written by the GSMA today. Oof. Right? Like this

205
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:03,005
Speaker 4:  is an evolving standard that is not perfect. Yep. Yeah. Are they tap backs

206
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:06,805
Speaker 4:  emoji? Like all this stuff that you need to, to support for make the messaging

207
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:10,725
Speaker 4:  have parody between devices and platforms and not just platforms between

208
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:14,685
Speaker 4:  phones, between messaging apps on the phones, Samsung messages

209
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,725
Speaker 4:  uses different tap backs and emojis than Google message. Like

210
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:22,805
Speaker 4:  this is, it's a very complicated and there's a reason that the, the landscape

211
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,885
Speaker 4:  fragments, but it is also very well known

212
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:31,365
Speaker 4:  that the fragmentation creates lock-in So. I'm just gonna mention

213
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:34,245
Speaker 4:  something that is bananas to bring up in this context.

214
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:38,165
Speaker 4:  Especially 'cause of what happened in 2001

215
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:42,525
Speaker 4:  when the Bush administration approved the AO

216
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:43,885
Speaker 4:  Health Time Warner merger. Oh

217
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:44,125
Speaker 5:  God.

218
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:50,645
Speaker 4:  Which I would say is historically not a success and in fact might be such

219
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:54,645
Speaker 4:  a historic failure that people bring it up all the time. But in 2001 when

220
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:56,165
Speaker 4:  the Bush administration people

221
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,445
Speaker 5:  Bring it up all the time, Kara

222
00:13:57,475 --> 00:14:00,445
Speaker 4:  Swer wrote a book about how much of a disaster it's, but the Bush administration,

223
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:04,765
Speaker 4:  not your lollygagging liberals, but the Bush administration,

224
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:09,205
Speaker 4:  the war in Iraq, one approved the AOL Time Warner merger. The

225
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:12,965
Speaker 4:  biggest condition on this merger was that AOL open

226
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,765
Speaker 4:  up AOL instant Messenger to interoperability because

227
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:20,445
Speaker 4:  their biggest fear was that by munging together

228
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:24,245
Speaker 4:  content and pipes that you would, everyone would sign up for this service

229
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:27,605
Speaker 4:  and then there would be no competition because no one would ever leave AOL

230
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:31,205
Speaker 4:  instant Messenger. Now this fear turned out to be not the biggest

231
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:35,165
Speaker 4:  problem with this merger, but when the government evaluated, okay,

232
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,685
Speaker 4:  what are the competitive harms of allowing these two big companies to get

233
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:42,605
Speaker 4:  bigger, the number one thing they looked at was this messaging service

234
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:47,445
Speaker 4:  is lockin. Yeah. This is a million years ago. And.

235
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:51,325
Speaker 4:  what you have right now is the European Union looking at a bunch of big services

236
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:54,965
Speaker 4:  with lock-in effects saying how do we make these markets more competitive

237
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:58,845
Speaker 4:  in passing rules? So you end up with USPC. On the one hand we, we wanna cut

238
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:02,445
Speaker 4:  down e-waste, we want to make all these products more interoperable.

239
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:06,485
Speaker 4:  You have the Digital Markets Act, which says some of these products are gatekeepers

240
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:10,045
Speaker 4:  and they need to open up and be transparent. Some of these products are

241
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:13,925
Speaker 4:  core services and they need to be interoperable. And I was wrong earlier,

242
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:18,005
Speaker 4:  iMessage is not a gatekeeper. It would be a core service. Google

243
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:21,565
Speaker 4:  has argued, has filed letters saying iMessage should be considered a core

244
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:24,485
Speaker 4:  service and be made to be made interoperable. That's how you get to something

245
00:15:24,485 --> 00:15:28,085
Speaker 4:  like RCS and you see the European government is saying, okay, these markets

246
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:31,725
Speaker 4:  are not competitive enough in the same way that, again, the Bush

247
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:35,005
Speaker 4:  administration 20 years ago, 22 years ago

248
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:39,245
Speaker 4:  thought, okay, messaging apps create lock-in. We should force them to be

249
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:39,725
Speaker 4:  interoperable.

250
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:43,805
Speaker 6:  Was there just like a really big ICQ fan in the Bush administration and they're

251
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:44,965
Speaker 6:  like, we gotta protect it. I

252
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:48,605
Speaker 4:  Was looking for it. There's a very long memo the FCC wrote about messaging

253
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:52,285
Speaker 4:  lock-in in 2001. That's like, we're gonna do this. And by the way,

254
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:55,445
Speaker 4:  AOL pushed back on this, like this is all just an echo of ancient history

255
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:59,245
Speaker 4:  in tech, but messaging apps create lock-in is not some new

256
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:02,685
Speaker 4:  idea. And again, we've seen the evidence again from our own history with

257
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:06,645
Speaker 4:  tech policy from emails between Apple executives themselves

258
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:10,605
Speaker 4:  who know it from the evidence produced in the European Union DMA process

259
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:15,285
Speaker 4:  from Google, which is obviously self-interested and I I think this is the

260
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:19,085
Speaker 4:  right move. But I think as we've all been saying how they execute

261
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:23,005
Speaker 4:  this, if they just drop in RCS as the thing that

262
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:26,805
Speaker 4:  SM SMS is today, I have no idea how it will go. It will be an

263
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:28,045
Speaker 4:  improvement. Well

264
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,205
Speaker 6:  I think it's really important that the fact that they're still planning to

265
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:32,525
Speaker 6:  appeal. Right? Like

266
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:35,045
Speaker 4:  Although Meta is appealing it for Messenger,

267
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,965
Speaker 6:  Right? They're they're appealing it for Messenger because they're like, well

268
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:42,005
Speaker 6:  this thing we force everybody to download in order to communicate on Facebook

269
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:46,005
Speaker 6:  definitely has nothing to do with lock in. Yeah, sure. Guys,

270
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,485
Speaker 5:  In a funny way, like in the context of the DMA

271
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:54,205
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp is a much more interesting case here than

272
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:58,165
Speaker 5:  iMessage. Like we had this big argument in Slack this week when the nothing

273
00:16:58,295 --> 00:17:00,005
Speaker 5:  chats stuff came out, which we

274
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:00,605
Speaker 6:  Haven't even talked

275
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:03,925
Speaker 5:  About. No. We'll, we'll get to that. Nothing is a boring company full of

276
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:07,765
Speaker 5:  boring technology. We'll come back to it. It's nothing. It's nothing. No

277
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:11,685
Speaker 5:  nothing. Released a thing with a company called Sunbird that basically lets

278
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:15,245
Speaker 5:  you use iMessage looking tech on your Android phone.

279
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:17,485
Speaker 5:  It's sort of interesting and sort of sketchy. We should come back to that.

280
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:21,205
Speaker 5:  But WhatsApp is just like orders of

281
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:25,365
Speaker 5:  magnitude bigger and more important in Europe than iMessage or anything

282
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:29,285
Speaker 5:  else. Like our, our whole international team was like, who caress? Why is

283
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:33,205
Speaker 5:  this news? Everybody uses WhatsApp. Americans are idiots for using iMessage.

284
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:35,165
Speaker 5:  They're not wrong. It's a, it's a fair take

285
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:39,325
Speaker 6:  300 And what? 15 million Americans? Yeah.

286
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:41,925
Speaker 4:  That's, that's not nothing. Red-blooded Americans

287
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:43,525
Speaker 6:  Love their blue bubbles.

288
00:17:43,575 --> 00:17:47,325
Speaker 4:  Every morning I rev my pickup truck engine and I send some blue bubbles out.

289
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:51,365
Speaker 5:  No, our problem as a country is what we love is SMS, which is, which is

290
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:55,365
Speaker 5:  actually the interesting thing here. Like if, if, if you like boil the goal

291
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:59,165
Speaker 5:  of RCS all the way down, like get out of the sort of intercompany politics

292
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:02,645
Speaker 5:  of it all. Its goal is to replace SMS, which is

293
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:06,845
Speaker 5:  bad insecure technology with better, more

294
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:10,845
Speaker 5:  secure, more media focused technology. Like the

295
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:13,845
Speaker 5:  people who make the standards are not interested in like the Google Apple

296
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:17,565
Speaker 5:  fight. They're just saying SMS sucks. We built it as like a rounding

297
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:21,405
Speaker 5:  error for carriers to send stuff 25 years ago. We need

298
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:24,405
Speaker 5:  a better system that is better for sending media. It's more secure, it has

299
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:28,245
Speaker 5:  larger file sizes. Like we just have to open up the pipes of message sending.

300
00:18:28,665 --> 00:18:32,525
Speaker 5:  So in that sense, RCS is like an a, a universally good

301
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:36,285
Speaker 5:  idea. It's kind of a messy technology, but like, so is SMS, right? Like

302
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:40,085
Speaker 5:  all of it is weird and wonky and has its issues. But like I think RCS is

303
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,445
Speaker 5:  an obvious upgrade on SMS in just about every way. The question is,

304
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:47,245
Speaker 5:  and this goes back to what Tim Cook says is like, are Apple users

305
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:51,765
Speaker 5:  clamoring for this? And I think the product case that you can

306
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:55,565
Speaker 5:  make, which they made in the question to him is like, well, people are sending

307
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:59,565
Speaker 5:  me videos and images that look like shit because they come

308
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:03,405
Speaker 5:  from an Android phone. And so Apple here can do

309
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:07,005
Speaker 5:  the bare minimum and still tell both a product

310
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:10,725
Speaker 5:  and a security story. That is also a case to regulators about

311
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:14,685
Speaker 5:  interoperability. So like to me, the idea that Apple would go out of

312
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:17,845
Speaker 5:  its way to like integrate this better and make it seem nice is

313
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:22,045
Speaker 5:  ludicrous. It's going to replace green bubbles with RCS

314
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:25,645
Speaker 5:  wherever it can because it's gonna make the like lowest common denominator

315
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:28,485
Speaker 5:  of messaging better and then it's never gonna talk about it again.

316
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:32,485
Speaker 6:  Is this gonna fix that issue where when someone from an Android phone sends

317
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,245
Speaker 6:  you a video, it's the size of a postage stamp?

318
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:34,765
Speaker 5:  It should.

319
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:36,045
Speaker 4:  That's the idea. Yes.

320
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:40,365
Speaker 6:  Okay. I mean that's the only thing I really run into besides the whole like

321
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:42,685
Speaker 6:  potential to be hacked and and too fast.

322
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,725
Speaker 4:  Also photos are horribly low resolution.

323
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,165
Speaker 6:  Nobody sends me photos on Android.

324
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:49,605
Speaker 5:  One funny thing I was thinking about in the context of this is Anna, my wife

325
00:19:49,745 --> 00:19:53,725
Speaker 5:  is a diehard Android user and absolutely steadfastly will never

326
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,325
Speaker 5:  switch. And we have resorted to

327
00:19:57,235 --> 00:20:01,205
Speaker 5:  sharing photos and videos via Google photos. Like that's just where

328
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:04,285
Speaker 5:  all our stuff lives. Because if I text her a picture, it comes through like

329
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:07,925
Speaker 5:  a 1992 phone camera shot it. And so

330
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:12,445
Speaker 5:  now we have this thing where it's actually, we, we've bypassed Apple products

331
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,965
Speaker 5:  because Apple has made this experience so painful for both of us to try and

332
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,285
Speaker 5:  do this. And if I'm Apple it's like, okay, there's, there's this little tweak

333
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:22,765
Speaker 5:  we can make that might actually solve some of our problems without creating

334
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:23,765
Speaker 5:  any new ones for us.

335
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:28,085
Speaker 4:  No, the more you, the more you are talking about this, the shittier Apple

336
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:32,165
Speaker 4:  seams, just to be blunt about it. Yeah. They have bet

337
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:35,965
Speaker 4:  against people in the United States switching to any other messaging

338
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:39,765
Speaker 4:  service knowing that SMS is insecure and a

339
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:43,325
Speaker 4:  privacy risk just because all that stuff is sitting on your carrier

340
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:47,365
Speaker 4:  servers unencrypted and avail, avail. Like that stuff can

341
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:51,085
Speaker 4:  be sold that we ran a quick post last week. There's

342
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:54,845
Speaker 4:  a privacy suit against car manufacturers that's caught up in some like litigation

343
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:59,725
Speaker 4:  strategy stuff. And part of it is car makers when they

344
00:20:59,845 --> 00:21:02,165
Speaker 4:  ingest the text from your phone, they can just read all of your texts in

345
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:05,885
Speaker 4:  plain text. 'cause that's a message shit. And so Apple's like running

346
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:09,805
Speaker 4:  around crowing about privacy. They have internal documents we've

347
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:12,085
Speaker 4:  seen from some of these trials saying Android is a tracking machine it's

348
00:21:12,085 --> 00:21:16,045
Speaker 4:  against. And then they know they are betting against consumers

349
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:19,685
Speaker 4:  in this country switching to anything that is more secure. They're

350
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:22,645
Speaker 4:  betting against you being able to send photos and videos to your family and

351
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:26,365
Speaker 4:  their answer is that you should buy their hardware Yeah. To achieve a better

352
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:28,765
Speaker 4:  software experience. Yeah. I mean like that is just callous, right? Like

353
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:31,005
Speaker 4:  we should just call that out, especially now it's like we we're at the end

354
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:34,645
Speaker 4:  of the road in some way, like it's been callous the entire time. I mean,

355
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:38,005
Speaker 5:  And that is the story I like. I don't think there is another read of the

356
00:21:38,285 --> 00:21:41,925
Speaker 5:  situation that doesn't end there. Like Apple, apple is convinced

357
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:46,405
Speaker 5:  that the solution you will devise to this

358
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:50,285
Speaker 5:  experience sucks is you will buy more Apple products and like Apple's not

359
00:21:50,285 --> 00:21:54,045
Speaker 5:  the only company to rely on crappy products to make you buy

360
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:57,405
Speaker 5:  their products, but it is, that is what they're doing. And Tim Cook Yeah,

361
00:21:57,445 --> 00:21:59,325
Speaker 5:  I mean he said as much buy your mom an iPhone. Yeah.

362
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:02,765
Speaker 6:  Like it was a brazenly, callous thing he said because the guy's like it's

363
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:05,645
Speaker 6:  He did laugh. Yeah. I mean it was, it was funny, right? Like it was very

364
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:09,125
Speaker 6:  funny. I laughed watching it, but, but at the same time the guy's like, I

365
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,085
Speaker 6:  can't text my mom photos. And he's like, yeah, we'll buy her an iPhone. And

366
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:15,765
Speaker 6:  it's like in the context of that room, given what code conference is that

367
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:17,325
Speaker 6:  kind of makes sense, but like Yeah.

368
00:22:17,465 --> 00:22:19,805
Speaker 4:  All the other billionaires in the room were like, I have a

369
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,085
Speaker 6:  Knife. Yeah. They're like, oh yeah, like I spit and I can buy my rob.

370
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:25,965
Speaker 4:  There's three Google executives who are furious. Yeah. Yeah. And then everyone

371
00:22:25,965 --> 00:22:28,885
Speaker 4:  else, and don don't mean to say it's callous, like it's maliciously wrong.

372
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:32,365
Speaker 4:  Right? I mean to say like they picked their business interests over their

373
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:36,045
Speaker 4:  values, which we have been seeing across these

374
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:39,925
Speaker 4:  trials, especially the d oj trial with Google. Yep. When it comes to

375
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,685
Speaker 4:  privacy, apple says one thing and they take the money

376
00:22:43,715 --> 00:22:47,645
Speaker 4:  from another thing like over and over and over again. When it comes to

377
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:51,045
Speaker 4:  that default search deal with Google, they will go out in public and they'll

378
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:53,805
Speaker 4:  bash Google over the head and they'll bash Android and they'll say they don't

379
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:57,405
Speaker 4:  track you and then the check clears and they're sending

380
00:22:57,735 --> 00:23:01,645
Speaker 4:  every search you make to Google. Yep. Yep. And Google's making

381
00:23:01,905 --> 00:23:05,205
Speaker 4:  all that money back by running advertising against the searches you make

382
00:23:05,205 --> 00:23:09,085
Speaker 4:  on the iPhone. And you put that next to this RCS decision and

383
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:12,885
Speaker 4:  you're like, okay. Until the European Union pushed Apple

384
00:23:12,885 --> 00:23:16,805
Speaker 4:  into a corner, they were more than happy to

385
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:20,765
Speaker 4:  say The answer to private messaging on our product is not you

386
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:23,805
Speaker 4:  figuring it out or getting your friends to use WhatsApp or Signal or whatever.

387
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:27,525
Speaker 4:  It's, it's buy an iPhone and that's just, it should

388
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:31,285
Speaker 4:  outta the box. The iPhone should be able to send encrypted messages to every

389
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:35,125
Speaker 4:  other phone. Yeah, you should, you should not have to run into Mark Zuckerberg's

390
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:35,845
Speaker 4:  waiting arms. Well, you,

391
00:23:35,845 --> 00:23:38,565
Speaker 6:  You can you just download like Signal or something?

392
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,885
Speaker 4:  I but out. But, but this is the thing we, if you look at the

393
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:46,245
Speaker 4:  Chinese market, you look at the European market, those markets are more competitive

394
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:47,925
Speaker 4:  in terms of device switching the United States

395
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:50,485
Speaker 5:  Because the app is the lock-in not the device.

396
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:54,325
Speaker 4:  Right. And so you just see here, once you have an iPhone, you're, you're

397
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:57,285
Speaker 4:  sitting on it forever. Whereas in Europe there is a little bit more device

398
00:23:57,285 --> 00:24:00,685
Speaker 4:  switching because WhatsApp is the messaging layer in China, it's

399
00:24:00,945 --> 00:24:04,365
Speaker 4:  WeChat, WeChat is the messaging layer and actually the application layer

400
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:09,125
Speaker 4:  in Japan, it's what line you see these other markets where the, the LOCKIN

401
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,725
Speaker 4:  layer is an application that runs across everyone's phones and people switch

402
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:14,965
Speaker 4:  phones all the time. In India there's a, we bring this up all the time. It's

403
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:18,645
Speaker 4:  my favorite phone market. There's like 10 new Android phones released a week

404
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:22,085
Speaker 4:  in India. Yeah. Because it is just such a vibrantly competitive market for

405
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:25,525
Speaker 4:  phones and we just see none of it. There's a, a former VERGE editor, Sam

406
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:29,085
Speaker 4:  Byford has a new newsletter like Gadgets. He's based in Japan. He has a great

407
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:32,805
Speaker 4:  piece recently about Chinese phones and like Huawei and

408
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:36,485
Speaker 4:  Leica and using Litech. And he, he points out that the American phone reviewer

409
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:40,285
Speaker 4:  has no view into those markets, does not use those phones,

410
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:44,805
Speaker 4:  and often just sort of buys Apple's line that the camera is better and that

411
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:47,325
Speaker 4:  the Leica is just fake branding. And he's like, actually Dick, we'll we'll

412
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:49,965
Speaker 4:  link it. It's just a good read. You can disagree or not disagree with it.

413
00:24:49,965 --> 00:24:52,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah. To be fair, Leica was fake branding on quite a few phones

414
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:56,085
Speaker 4:  There. Right. But now the phones have like accelerated. Yeah. It's just like

415
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:59,965
Speaker 4:  a really interesting piece. Like the view in a more, the view from a more

416
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:03,525
Speaker 4:  competitive market is always, I think fascinating and illuminating

417
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:07,805
Speaker 4:  even if you disagree with it in the end. But our market for phones

418
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:12,405
Speaker 4:  is extremely uncompetitive 'cause of the lock-in

419
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,365
Speaker 4:  that is imposed by various companies. Yeah. We don't have, and by the way,

420
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:17,645
Speaker 4:  it's not say that Google doesn't do it too, or it wouldn't if it could, but

421
00:25:18,065 --> 00:25:22,005
Speaker 5:  It has tried so many times. Well, and I think it, it's also telling that

422
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:26,045
Speaker 5:  Apple's market share in the US is so high as a result, right? Like one of

423
00:25:26,045 --> 00:25:29,005
Speaker 5:  the reasons this matters so much in the US is because so many people use

424
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:32,925
Speaker 5:  iPhones here it is, it is a dominant platform here in a way it's not

425
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:36,965
Speaker 5:  just about anywhere else. And a huge part of that is because of

426
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:40,965
Speaker 5:  iMessage. Like the strategy works, it's not there, there's no question

427
00:25:40,965 --> 00:25:44,805
Speaker 5:  about how to enact that strategy. And so to some extent

428
00:25:45,415 --> 00:25:49,125
Speaker 5:  you'd be crazy to stop doing it, right? It's like those emails between them

429
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:52,445
Speaker 5:  where they're like, oh, we should do iMessage for Android, anyone

430
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:56,205
Speaker 5:  thinking about, you know, returning value to shareholders is gonna

431
00:25:56,355 --> 00:26:00,205
Speaker 5:  like shoot you dead with a sniper rifle for having that conversation.

432
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:00,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

433
00:26:00,885 --> 00:26:04,005
Speaker 6:  I I I think that's what drives it, right? Like they, they gotta return that

434
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:07,485
Speaker 6:  value. It's, it's a huge business decision. And and it's the same with a

435
00:26:07,485 --> 00:26:11,245
Speaker 6:  lot of the things they do that feel like kind of crappy. Yeah. The RAM

436
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:15,085
Speaker 6:  was a big discussion too this week of like the eight gigabytes of RAM on

437
00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:17,765
Speaker 6:  the MacBook Pro. And that's something they've been doing for, for decades

438
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:21,285
Speaker 6:  at this point, is like being kind of cheap on the ram and then upselling

439
00:26:21,285 --> 00:26:25,125
Speaker 6:  you via them and, and soldering in the ram and all of this stuff and,

440
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,925
Speaker 6:  and just because yeah, it makes them extra money and they company and, and

441
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:29,885
Speaker 6:  their time is to make money.

442
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:32,005
Speaker 4:  Tim Cook does have that sniper's eye.

443
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:32,645
Speaker 6:  He does.

444
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:36,085
Speaker 4:  It's a real thing. Got it. The last thing I'll say about this, then we should

445
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:39,645
Speaker 4:  move on. You know, you go back to that code clip. Tim says, I don't see our

446
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:43,725
Speaker 4:  customers asking for this. I can see our traffic, I can see how

447
00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:46,125
Speaker 4:  many people are reading about the offense supporting RCS today.

448
00:26:46,195 --> 00:26:48,885
Speaker 6:  It's just, look we saw earlier this week, the target

449
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:52,725
Speaker 6:  CEO said something similar. He was like, yeah, I don't see customers asking

450
00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:56,005
Speaker 6:  us to take all the shampoo outta the lockbox. Just

451
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,445
Speaker 4:  Put it in. They're saying thank you. Yeah. And

452
00:26:57,445 --> 00:27:01,005
Speaker 6:  It's like, cool. What, what customers are you talking to Tim or Target?

453
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:03,005
Speaker 6:  CEO? Like who?

454
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:07,165
Speaker 5:  Well, but this is the thing. They're not, people aren't asking for RCS. Like,

455
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:10,405
Speaker 5:  I, I genuinely believe that's true. Believe nobody is emailing Tim Cook except

456
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:13,285
Speaker 5:  for like Dieter saying, why don't you support RCS?

457
00:27:14,845 --> 00:27:17,685
Speaker 5:  I think he's tim@apple.com. If you want to send him a note, don don't know

458
00:27:17,685 --> 00:27:21,285
Speaker 5:  if he reads them or not, but he, he gets them. But what people

459
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:25,525
Speaker 5:  reasonably can and should ask for is my mom

460
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:29,005
Speaker 5:  can't send me a picture. Right. Yeah. Like that is the thing. And I think

461
00:27:29,765 --> 00:27:33,685
Speaker 5:  whether by regulatory reasons or because Apple just decided this is not the

462
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,325
Speaker 5:  hill to die on, which don don't think is the case. I'm pretty sure it's just

463
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:40,645
Speaker 5:  regulatory reasons. Like it's gonna get better for those people

464
00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:44,165
Speaker 5:  even if they don't understand the underlying technology because they shouldn't

465
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:47,405
Speaker 5:  have to. And this is the thing that Apple always says it does, right? Is

466
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:51,085
Speaker 5:  it's like we are going to make good decisions for you and not require you

467
00:27:51,085 --> 00:27:53,605
Speaker 5:  to think about it. And what it has done in this case to your earlier point,

468
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:57,525
Speaker 5:  Neli is over and over not give people

469
00:27:57,785 --> 00:28:01,325
Speaker 5:  the better option even though it existed. So it is, it is

470
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:05,405
Speaker 5:  good news to see it finally happening, even if it's clearly not out of just

471
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:06,485
Speaker 5:  like the goodness of Apple's

472
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:10,285
Speaker 4:  Heart. And again, the, the execution, I think it was Nathan on our team

473
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:13,845
Speaker 4:  brought up the phrase malicious compliance today. Like we have to see, this

474
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:16,405
Speaker 4:  is where I was gonna complain about USPC. Are you ready for this? And then

475
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:19,725
Speaker 4:  we'll end it. The number of devices I have now

476
00:28:20,095 --> 00:28:23,805
Speaker 4:  where all the manufacturer has done is take out the micro USB

477
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,485
Speaker 4:  port and put in A-U-S-P-C port without the

478
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:31,245
Speaker 4:  correspond. And this is like two resistors they need to put in there, but

479
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:34,965
Speaker 4:  they haven't done it. So you can only charge with

480
00:28:35,165 --> 00:28:39,005
Speaker 4:  A-U-S-B-A to USBC cable. I have like,

481
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:41,205
Speaker 4:  it's like an increasing number of devices.

482
00:28:41,435 --> 00:28:42,405
Speaker 5:  What are these devices?

483
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:46,925
Speaker 4:  So it's everything from like our extremely stupid milk frother that we use

484
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,325
Speaker 4:  to stir protein powder into water.

485
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,685
Speaker 5:  That one feels like your fault. You

486
00:28:50,005 --> 00:28:53,565
Speaker 4:  S but like we just bought it and I was like USBC, it's great. No only charge

487
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,445
Speaker 4:  with thing. And then I have one of those lumen metabolism trackers that v

488
00:28:57,445 --> 00:29:01,245
Speaker 4:  really likes. Yeah. This is like a gadget, like a Silicon Valley

489
00:29:01,245 --> 00:29:05,205
Speaker 4:  venture funded gadget company. They just went boop, USBA to US

490
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:09,165
Speaker 4:  pc and it's like the whole range. I've got a people, I've got all kinds of

491
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:12,645
Speaker 4:  people on threads right now just listing the gadgets they have that's terrible,

492
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:15,805
Speaker 4:  that are broken in this specific way. And the thing that, that has not been

493
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:19,525
Speaker 4:  done, I've learned all about this today. The thing that has not been done

494
00:29:19,785 --> 00:29:23,685
Speaker 4:  is when you call for power from USPC charger, you can either

495
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:27,005
Speaker 4:  do it the complicated way and send data and do the thing or you can just

496
00:29:27,005 --> 00:29:30,805
Speaker 4:  have two little resistors that tell it just send me

497
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:32,605
Speaker 4:  five five volts. Yeah.

498
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:34,085
Speaker 6:  I mean that's a full

499
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:36,485
Speaker 4:  Penny. Like just standard thing. Yeah. You can't, you can't just, and people

500
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:36,805
Speaker 4:  aren't doing it

501
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:39,045
Speaker 6:  Bend in those pennies like that just willy-nilly.

502
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:42,565
Speaker 4:  And so the manufacturers are are cheaping out and everyone, everyone is having

503
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:46,165
Speaker 4:  to, to like stock USBA to USBC. It's driving me

504
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:46,805
Speaker 4:  bananas.

505
00:29:47,115 --> 00:29:50,325
Speaker 6:  That would be like brutal to you get to the hotel room and you just wanna

506
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:53,885
Speaker 6:  froth some milk and you gotta, you're like, oh, I left my USBC to

507
00:29:53,885 --> 00:29:55,885
Speaker 6:  USBA and cable at home. That's brutal.

508
00:29:56,145 --> 00:29:59,285
Speaker 4:  Anyway, I'm just saying you can, you can impose the standard.

509
00:30:00,305 --> 00:30:02,845
Speaker 4:  It does not mean people will not be idiots. Yeah.

510
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:06,045
Speaker 5:  Well this is like the, the right to repair stuff that's happening right now

511
00:30:06,045 --> 00:30:08,965
Speaker 5:  with like parts pairing becoming a big issue where it's like, okay, sure,

512
00:30:09,035 --> 00:30:12,605
Speaker 5:  technically you can repair your Apple devices, but the

513
00:30:12,695 --> 00:30:16,365
Speaker 5:  parts that exist are digitally paired to the

514
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:20,565
Speaker 5:  product itself. Yeah. So yes, in theory you can take it

515
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:23,725
Speaker 5:  apart, but can you actually do anything with all the different pieces? No,

516
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:26,565
Speaker 5:  you can't. It's like, hmm, did we solve anything here?

517
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:30,645
Speaker 4:  Here's a list from Threads. It's a Chinese walkie-talkies. Somebody pointed

518
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:34,405
Speaker 4:  out to me that they have like Amazon alphabet soup, brand offbrand

519
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:38,045
Speaker 4:  massage guns like a rag gun, but like an off-brand. Okay. So they have to,

520
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:41,245
Speaker 4:  you know what I mean? Headphones, apparently headphones are the, the worst

521
00:30:41,745 --> 00:30:45,565
Speaker 4:  of, of these offenders bet beats. Lots of USBC headphones are actually

522
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:46,645
Speaker 4:  USPA in secret.

523
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,325
Speaker 6:  I bet all the beats headphones,

524
00:30:49,135 --> 00:30:51,165
Speaker 4:  Apple apple's just like f you. Yeah,

525
00:30:51,165 --> 00:30:51,645
Speaker 6:  They're not,

526
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:55,285
Speaker 4:  I'm just like, it's like it's out there. You can see A-U-S-B-C port and the,

527
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:59,685
Speaker 4:  the number of ways things can go wrong for you just keep

528
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:00,685
Speaker 4:  steadily increasing.

529
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:01,925
Speaker 6:  I don't like it.

530
00:31:02,265 --> 00:31:05,565
Speaker 4:  Anyhow. I look, I, I think the European Union should keep doing stuff like

531
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:06,805
Speaker 4:  our government isn't. I

532
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:10,565
Speaker 6:  I was like, I It would be nice if the government of the country that actually

533
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:12,245
Speaker 6:  uses iMessage did something.

534
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,885
Speaker 4:  That's fine. They're on iMessage. Yeah, you can, Leanna Khan has an Android

535
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:19,605
Speaker 4:  phone. Get outta here. All. right? We gotta take a break. We're gonna stop

536
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:23,125
Speaker 4:  complaining about governments and come back and complain about ai. See what

537
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:25,125
Speaker 4:  I'm, it's gonna be great. It's the Vergecast. We'll be right back.

538
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:34,615
Speaker 4:  Okay, we're back. Lots of AI news this week. Microsoft had a

539
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:38,455
Speaker 4:  conference, they rebranded some things which we'll get into. YouTube has

540
00:33:38,455 --> 00:33:42,295
Speaker 4:  a new deep fake policy, which is actually intention Google's AI tools, which

541
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:46,135
Speaker 4:  is fascinating. There's kind of a lot going on. Let's start with Microsoft.

542
00:33:46,165 --> 00:33:47,295
Speaker 4:  What happened at this conference?

543
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:50,055
Speaker 6:  They announced new processors. That's what you wanna talk about, right? That's

544
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:50,895
Speaker 4:  All I wanna talk about. All

545
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:51,535
Speaker 6:  You wanna talk about. Well,

546
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:54,455
Speaker 4:  I did the entire code conference. I asked every single person about Nvidia

547
00:33:54,495 --> 00:33:57,015
Speaker 4:  H 100 chips and they all said, man, that's a real problem.

548
00:33:58,395 --> 00:34:01,215
Speaker 4:  But the entire AI industry runs on one set of chips. Yeah.

549
00:34:01,345 --> 00:34:04,895
Speaker 6:  Which is why it is no surprise that when Jensen Wong, the

550
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:09,495
Speaker 6:  CEO of Nvidia showed up at Microsoft Ignite after they

551
00:34:09,565 --> 00:34:13,415
Speaker 6:  just announced a bunch of processors to compete with, his was still

552
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:17,295
Speaker 6:  there saying generative AI is the single most significant platform

553
00:34:17,295 --> 00:34:21,175
Speaker 6:  transition in computing history. I would absolutely

554
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:24,375
Speaker 6:  expect that from a man who is a billionaire because of generative

555
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:27,335
Speaker 4:  Ai. Then he tapped his humane ai pin vanished.

556
00:34:27,915 --> 00:34:31,695
Speaker 6:  But but yeah, so, so obviously the actual big news that

557
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:34,535
Speaker 6:  happened was they're getting rid of Bing ChatGPT. They're, they're changing

558
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:37,135
Speaker 6:  the name of it. It's now gonna be Microsoft Copilot.

559
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,975
Speaker 4:  I love how we're like, this is the biggest news.

560
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:42,655
Speaker 6:  It is the biggest news. And it's very, it's it's funny news because it was

561
00:34:42,655 --> 00:34:46,575
Speaker 6:  just earlier this year, they're like, Bing chat. Yeah, it's gonna be Bing.

562
00:34:46,575 --> 00:34:49,775
Speaker 6:  It's all about Bing. And they're like, no, we finally figured out an actual

563
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:52,975
Speaker 6:  good name. And it's Copilot Now don't, don't worry about that. Bing is

564
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:55,015
Speaker 1:  Good name. What we're going with for, for

565
00:34:55,245 --> 00:34:59,175
Speaker 6:  Copilot here. There's like, there's Bing and it's, it's, it's an All right

566
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:02,695
Speaker 6:  name. Copilot, I feel like is better for a generative AI

567
00:35:02,695 --> 00:35:06,575
Speaker 6:  assistant that like you're supposed to be friends sort of with

568
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,495
Speaker 4:  Well there's some history here. Yeah. Like a, first of all, there's like

569
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:11,135
Speaker 4:  a lot of history with Bing. Yes.

570
00:35:11,395 --> 00:35:12,295
Speaker 6:  Not of all of it. Good.

571
00:35:12,435 --> 00:35:16,415
Speaker 4:  Not all of it. Good. Then we were just talking, it's

572
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:20,375
Speaker 4:  like we're coming up on one year since ChatGPT hit. And so it's been a wild

573
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:23,215
Speaker 4:  year. In the middle of that year, you will recall Microsoft held its event

574
00:35:23,215 --> 00:35:26,335
Speaker 4:  where they announced Bing chat. Yeah. and they were

575
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,215
Speaker 6:  Gonna make Google sweat

576
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:30,975
Speaker 4:  Dance. Dance. That's right. And this is, to me, Nadella said to me, we're

577
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:34,295
Speaker 4:  gonna make, I want, I want Google to dance and I want people to know that

578
00:35:34,295 --> 00:35:38,285
Speaker 4:  we made them dance. Which is to this day the

579
00:35:38,475 --> 00:35:40,285
Speaker 4:  coldest thing ACEO has ever said to

580
00:35:40,285 --> 00:35:43,245
Speaker 6:  Me, that's what Snow White said to the evil stepmom at the end of the,

581
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:48,365
Speaker 4:  I want people to know I made you dance. Dance. Just try saying that

582
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:51,605
Speaker 4:  in your day-to-Day life, just walk up to anyone you know and be like, I want

583
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:55,085
Speaker 4:  them to dance and I want you to know that I made them dance. There are

584
00:35:55,465 --> 00:35:59,205
Speaker 4:  so few moments where that is an even close to

585
00:35:59,205 --> 00:35:59,725
Speaker 4:  appropriate.

586
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:01,925
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna open the next staff meeting that way.

587
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:07,085
Speaker 4:  I want wired to dance and I want people to know that we made them dance.

588
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,845
Speaker 4:  I mean that, by the way, if you're wired, start dancing. We we're

589
00:36:11,845 --> 00:36:13,005
Speaker 4:  friends. It's all fun. Just

590
00:36:13,165 --> 00:36:16,285
Speaker 6:  Happened. So. I. It's 'cause you're not here David. Yeah.

591
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:19,205
Speaker 4:  We're just, we're just losing our minds over here. We had a great time. So

592
00:36:19,215 --> 00:36:22,925
Speaker 4:  Nadal has this thing and he follows that up and he said this to a lot of

593
00:36:22,925 --> 00:36:26,765
Speaker 4:  people, any scrap of market share that he can take from Google represents

594
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:30,685
Speaker 4:  billions of dollars. Yeah. They took zero scraps of market share from

595
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:30,845
Speaker 4:  Google.

596
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:33,765
Speaker 5:  That's not true. They probably took like a scrap

597
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:38,605
Speaker 6:  My $9 coffee this morning. That's what they took. It was

598
00:36:38,605 --> 00:36:42,525
Speaker 5:  A, it was a win for Bing in that we talked more about Bing this

599
00:36:42,525 --> 00:36:46,005
Speaker 5:  year than we have cumulatively in the history of the universe.

600
00:36:46,355 --> 00:36:46,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

601
00:36:46,785 --> 00:36:50,325
Speaker 4:  But also, also, and they also pointed out that naming things that

602
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:54,445
Speaker 4:  Microsoft scale is impossible. Sure. Right. The sort of trademark reviews

603
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:58,325
Speaker 4:  and legal reviews and does this word mean a dirty word in another language

604
00:36:58,345 --> 00:37:01,925
Speaker 4:  is all very difficult. And like Bing is just sitting here and actually no

605
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:04,565
Speaker 4:  one ever thinks about it at all. It's like the opposite of a name. Right.

606
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:05,845
Speaker 4:  We're just gonna see what happens. Whereas

607
00:37:05,845 --> 00:37:07,965
Speaker 5:  It's like, what does cop law mean in France? Like,

608
00:37:08,545 --> 00:37:12,525
Speaker 4:  You're screwed. It's a real problem. Yeah. And the answer is what Bing

609
00:37:12,525 --> 00:37:15,965
Speaker 4:  means to most people is that it definitely tried to bang Kevin Roos on the

610
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:19,405
Speaker 4:  front page of the New York Times and it got, I would say in its feelings

611
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:20,845
Speaker 4:  with Ben Thompson and Eckery.

612
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,005
Speaker 5:  I don't think that's true. I think that massively overstates both

613
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:26,525
Speaker 4:  Things. That's what it means. That's what it means to me. But that is the

614
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:30,485
Speaker 4:  story they got from Bing was the front page of the times saying this thing

615
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:31,965
Speaker 4:  declared its love to me. Did you?

616
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:35,565
Speaker 6:  No, when, when they announced Bing, I just looked at the Google Trends data

617
00:37:36,195 --> 00:37:39,965
Speaker 6:  more people were talking about Bing after the, the sad passing of

618
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:43,765
Speaker 6:  Matthew Perry who played Chandler Bing than when Bing Oh my God. Pivoted

619
00:37:44,025 --> 00:37:45,205
Speaker 6:  to Bing ChatGPT. That

620
00:37:45,865 --> 00:37:47,925
Speaker 4:  That's not, I mean that's tragic. It's not

621
00:37:48,205 --> 00:37:51,885
Speaker 6:  Official tragic official no numbers. But it's sad. But it's, it's

622
00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:55,725
Speaker 6:  truth that like being as a rebranding big moment was not as perhaps

623
00:37:55,725 --> 00:37:56,045
Speaker 6:  successful.

624
00:37:56,045 --> 00:37:58,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. No one's banging successful. Yeah. And then I think there's the problem

625
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:02,445
Speaker 4:  that it lies to you all the time, which is if you're trying to replace

626
00:38:02,445 --> 00:38:05,645
Speaker 4:  search just a real problem. And we have written

627
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:09,845
Speaker 4:  so many stories about what is going on with Google search and the SEO community

628
00:38:09,845 --> 00:38:13,405
Speaker 4:  has responded with such aggressively SEO optimized

629
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:17,245
Speaker 4:  responses to us. It's great. They're obviously gonna outrank us in the end,

630
00:38:17,745 --> 00:38:21,605
Speaker 4:  but being as a product was not better than search. Like it was not

631
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:25,165
Speaker 4:  better than Google search. I think Google's own search generative experience,

632
00:38:25,165 --> 00:38:29,005
Speaker 4:  which is in beta, is a fascinating product. It is not

633
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:31,325
Speaker 4:  actually at this point better than search.

634
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:35,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Tom, Tom did our, our our post kind of announcing this

635
00:38:35,365 --> 00:38:38,965
Speaker 6:  rebranding and I thought he was, he was really clear on like, Bing wasn't

636
00:38:38,965 --> 00:38:42,925
Speaker 6:  succeeding as this search product, but it does actually succeed with helping

637
00:38:42,925 --> 00:38:45,765
Speaker 6:  people figure out spreadsheets and stuff like that. And, and that's what

638
00:38:45,925 --> 00:38:49,645
Speaker 6:  Microsoft is good at. And so like okay, realizing that search isn't actually

639
00:38:49,645 --> 00:38:52,965
Speaker 6:  their way forward with generative ai, but it's actually as a tool to help

640
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,845
Speaker 6:  this like productivity software that like yeah, that's a smart move. And

641
00:38:56,865 --> 00:39:00,645
Speaker 6:  it like, I wanna make fun. I love to make fun of Bing in and, and Bing ChatGPT

642
00:39:00,645 --> 00:39:04,005
Speaker 6:  and all of that. But, but what they did here was like, it was smart. It was

643
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:04,925
Speaker 6:  the right move. What's

644
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:08,765
Speaker 5:  Really funny to me is I think Microsoft got this exactly backwards.

645
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:12,845
Speaker 5:  Like if you, if you rewind to like February, march, Microsoft

646
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:16,125
Speaker 5:  was confident that Bing was going to be the front end

647
00:39:16,825 --> 00:39:20,805
Speaker 5:  for chat GPT. Right? That it was gonna be, this was gonna be how most people

648
00:39:21,605 --> 00:39:25,565
Speaker 5:  interact with this cool new AI technology. Open AI was just gonna

649
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:29,405
Speaker 5:  like keep building the underlying technology. It launched chat. GPT

650
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:33,005
Speaker 5:  is like a science project. Like it's, it's, it continues to be important

651
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:36,725
Speaker 5:  to remember that no one at OpenAI or anywhere else thought chat

652
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:40,645
Speaker 5:  GPT was gonna be as big as it was. And so Microsoft was like, we

653
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:44,365
Speaker 5:  can build the front end for this thing. And it turns out it got

654
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:48,005
Speaker 5:  exactly backwards where chat GPT is the front end for this thing

655
00:39:48,545 --> 00:39:52,045
Speaker 5:  and Bing is the real time web

656
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:55,765
Speaker 5:  index that you can attach to that. Like Bing is now

657
00:39:55,765 --> 00:39:59,725
Speaker 5:  infrastructure to these other things rather than being like the main

658
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:04,325
Speaker 5:  consumer product. And I think Copilot as a way into some of that is fine

659
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:07,685
Speaker 5:  and they'll keep attaching Copilot to everything. And I think the Copilot

660
00:40:07,685 --> 00:40:11,565
Speaker 5:  name is ridiculous because there's Copilot but then there's Copilots which

661
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:14,525
Speaker 5:  are the same but different and live in different apps and there're, it's

662
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:16,285
Speaker 5:  one thing but it's lots of things and I don't get it at all

663
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,285
Speaker 6:  Apple TV and TV plus. Yeah.

664
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:21,365
Speaker 5:  It's just, this is worse actually I think. Yeah. Yeah.

665
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:21,725
Speaker 6:  You're right.

666
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:25,725
Speaker 5:  But I think we got to this point where Bing one

667
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:28,845
Speaker 5:  had a minute where it was like we are going to be the consumer brand. We

668
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:32,765
Speaker 5:  have never successfully been able to be by being a different front end onto

669
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:36,645
Speaker 5:  the same sort of basic need and just whiffed it

670
00:40:36,675 --> 00:40:40,645
Speaker 5:  because ChatGPT GBT and OpenAI just absolutely completely ate its lunch.

671
00:40:41,035 --> 00:40:41,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

672
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:45,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And then the extensibility of ChatGPT GBT is much more interesting

673
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:45,485
Speaker 4:  than anything

674
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:46,085
Speaker 5:  Being told. Totally.

675
00:40:46,325 --> 00:40:50,005
Speaker 6:  I mean Bing is, Bing is trying, well Bing Microsoft is trying that too. They,

676
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:53,845
Speaker 6:  one of the other things they announced was Copilot Studios, which basically

677
00:40:53,845 --> 00:40:57,125
Speaker 6:  does the same thing that OpenAI is doing. Pretty natural text ways to like

678
00:40:57,125 --> 00:41:00,365
Speaker 6:  program new bots. And in that case I'm almost like, ooh,

679
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:05,045
Speaker 6:  Microsoft is probably much better equipped to handle a big

680
00:41:05,175 --> 00:41:08,885
Speaker 6:  store of, of bots than OpenAI, which we talked about last week.

681
00:41:08,995 --> 00:41:12,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Is clearly not ready for that So I.

682
00:41:12,835 --> 00:41:15,965
Speaker 6:  Like, I'm not gonna just immediately throw Microsoft out and say they lost

683
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:18,725
Speaker 6:  this and they, they, they screwed it up. I think like they've pivoted in

684
00:41:18,965 --> 00:41:22,405
Speaker 6:  probably really smart direction Oh yeah. To still stay a part of this conversation.

685
00:41:22,505 --> 00:41:26,245
Speaker 6:  But like Bing is, is done as, as like this whole

686
00:41:26,865 --> 00:41:28,205
Speaker 6:  is it Bing's moment? It's not.

687
00:41:28,565 --> 00:41:31,245
Speaker 5:  Microsoft is a big winner in all of this. I think in a big way. It's like,

688
00:41:31,245 --> 00:41:34,765
Speaker 5:  I think what it's done with Copilot stupid Namic aside

689
00:41:35,345 --> 00:41:39,285
Speaker 5:  is really smart, right? It's like it, Microsoft has leaned into what

690
00:41:39,285 --> 00:41:43,245
Speaker 5:  are actually its core competencies, which is like putting helpful tools

691
00:41:43,475 --> 00:41:47,205
Speaker 5:  into apps that people use, right? Like AI to help you turn your spreadsheets

692
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:50,485
Speaker 5:  into slide decks is just an unbelievably good idea. And I think

693
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:53,925
Speaker 5:  there is an overwhelming chance that Microsoft is gonna be better at that

694
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:57,565
Speaker 5:  than anybody for a long time. A lot of this stuff Microsoft is working on

695
00:41:57,565 --> 00:42:00,725
Speaker 5:  is about Azure as much as anything. Right. Like that's the reason they got

696
00:42:00,725 --> 00:42:03,645
Speaker 5:  in bed with OpenAI in the first place was what OpenAI needed was compute.

697
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:06,125
Speaker 5:  So Microsoft is gonna build this compute and then there's gonna be a ton

698
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:09,045
Speaker 5:  of competitors to OpenAI, all of whom are gonna use Azure because Microsoft

699
00:42:09,105 --> 00:42:12,925
Speaker 5:  is ahead. Like Microsoft is going to win in a big, big, big way

700
00:42:12,925 --> 00:42:16,645
Speaker 5:  here. It just isn't going to win in like the

701
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:19,965
Speaker 5:  cool way. If that makes sense. Yeah. Like it's not gonna be

702
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:24,165
Speaker 5:  the number one app in the app store winner, it's just going to do what

703
00:42:24,325 --> 00:42:27,165
Speaker 5:  Microsoft always does, which is be like kind of nerdy and quiet and make

704
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:27,845
Speaker 5:  so much

705
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,885
Speaker 6:  Money. That's the Microsoft way except for with the Xbox 360

706
00:42:31,265 --> 00:42:34,925
Speaker 4:  And the Xbox One. I mean they did promise to reinvent the

707
00:42:34,925 --> 00:42:38,445
Speaker 4:  television. It didn't, it didn't happen. Actually, this brings me to the

708
00:42:38,445 --> 00:42:41,845
Speaker 4:  other thing they announced, which I think is super fascinating. It's Windows

709
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:46,045
Speaker 4:  app. Yes. Where you can now just download an app that will run

710
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:49,045
Speaker 4:  Windows on the iPhone, the iPad, the Mac and

711
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:53,565
Speaker 4:  PCs. Which is, it makes sense once you think about it for two seconds,

712
00:42:54,265 --> 00:42:58,085
Speaker 4:  but is also just one of the funniest, right? It's just, it's just a virtualize,

713
00:42:58,085 --> 00:42:58,605
Speaker 4:  it's a, I

714
00:42:58,605 --> 00:43:01,085
Speaker 5:  Wanna like Pimp by ride like Yo Dogg, I hear you like Windows host.

715
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:05,205
Speaker 4:  It's like, it's just funny on its face. It's like conceptually makes perfect

716
00:43:05,255 --> 00:43:08,485
Speaker 4:  sense that if you're gonna sell virtualized Windows you should be able to

717
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:12,445
Speaker 4:  run it on a pc. But it is just kind of like Windows is now an app to run

718
00:43:12,445 --> 00:43:16,085
Speaker 4:  on your Windows is very good. It is. I think this is one of the smartest

719
00:43:16,175 --> 00:43:20,165
Speaker 4:  moves that they've made in a long time because it allows them to

720
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:24,325
Speaker 4:  continue getting value out of the Windows software ecosystem even as

721
00:43:24,765 --> 00:43:26,205
Speaker 4:  everyone kind of runs away from it. I

722
00:43:26,205 --> 00:43:29,885
Speaker 6:  Mean it's to the point of the interoperability conversation we had just,

723
00:43:30,115 --> 00:43:34,045
Speaker 6:  just in the segment before this, this is like just much more user friendly.

724
00:43:34,785 --> 00:43:38,565
Speaker 6:  It gives, it doesn't say, Hey, go buy a whole Windows PC to, to

725
00:43:38,565 --> 00:43:41,765
Speaker 6:  check out this app or whatever that you need to work on. Yeah. Just, you

726
00:43:41,765 --> 00:43:43,045
Speaker 6:  don't have to do that. And that's

727
00:43:43,045 --> 00:43:46,205
Speaker 4:  Nice. So it's not for consumers yet. It's still in testing. There's no Android

728
00:43:46,205 --> 00:43:49,925
Speaker 4:  version yet. It's very much for enterprise and you can, it

729
00:43:50,035 --> 00:43:54,005
Speaker 4:  streams, it's streaming basically it's remote desktop, but it can

730
00:43:54,005 --> 00:43:57,605
Speaker 4:  stream Windows from a remote PC of your own Azure Virtual

731
00:43:57,605 --> 00:44:01,405
Speaker 4:  desktop, Windows 365, Microsoft Dev Box and Microsoft Remote

732
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:05,245
Speaker 4:  Desktop Services. But it's called Windows app, which is, it's just very

733
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:05,525
Speaker 4:  funny.

734
00:44:05,885 --> 00:44:09,525
Speaker 6:  I, I feel bad because I really like Parallels, which is the, the virtualization

735
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:13,845
Speaker 6:  software to run Windows on a Mac. And if I can just do that, I probably would

736
00:44:13,845 --> 00:44:13,965
Speaker 6:  just

737
00:44:13,965 --> 00:44:17,365
Speaker 4:  Do that. Well, so Parallels is it doing great on m series chips?

738
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:19,565
Speaker 6:  That makes sense. It's probably, I

739
00:44:19,565 --> 00:44:20,685
Speaker 4:  Don't, I don't know the answer to that question.

740
00:44:20,835 --> 00:44:22,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I I I don't know either. Actually

741
00:44:22,825 --> 00:44:26,525
Speaker 4:  My wife's business runs on a, a Windows app that she runs in

742
00:44:26,725 --> 00:44:30,165
Speaker 4:  Parallels on an Intel Mac. Oh boy. And I, we have not upgraded it 'cause

743
00:44:30,205 --> 00:44:34,125
Speaker 4:  I just, I'm her IT guy. Yeah. And I'm just like, you just keep using it

744
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:38,005
Speaker 4:  until Mac, you just keep going. I got a 2015 iMac up here in case you

745
00:44:38,005 --> 00:44:41,645
Speaker 4:  ever need a bigger screen. And I've been waiting for basically this

746
00:44:42,005 --> 00:44:45,285
Speaker 4:  solution. Yeah. Like quite some time. But I think it, you're just watching

747
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:49,125
Speaker 4:  sort of Windows stop being tied to a computer in the

748
00:44:49,245 --> 00:44:53,205
Speaker 4:  way that I think obviously the Mac, like Mac OSS is very tied to a

749
00:44:53,205 --> 00:44:56,405
Speaker 4:  machine. Yeah. Windows is now like a very distributed application layer.

750
00:44:56,505 --> 00:45:00,325
Speaker 5:  It turns Windows into a web browser in a, in a really like important

751
00:45:00,425 --> 00:45:04,245
Speaker 5:  and interesting way that it's like instead of having

752
00:45:04,305 --> 00:45:07,685
Speaker 5:  all of your stuff be web apps or whatever, you can functionally have them

753
00:45:07,845 --> 00:45:11,725
Speaker 5:  all still look and feel and work like local apps with all of the

754
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:15,805
Speaker 5:  upsides of being available everywhere. Like Microsoft is

755
00:45:15,955 --> 00:45:19,565
Speaker 5:  betting huge on edge right. As kind of the, the front end to

756
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:23,965
Speaker 5:  the next generation of software. But it can keep with Windows, which

757
00:45:23,965 --> 00:45:26,365
Speaker 5:  is actually a really smart like backwards compatibility thing because there

758
00:45:26,365 --> 00:45:29,885
Speaker 5:  are all these people in the world who are like, I am not going to use

759
00:45:30,225 --> 00:45:34,085
Speaker 5:  the Excel web app because gross and I have a bunch of stuff that

760
00:45:34,085 --> 00:45:36,965
Speaker 5:  doesn't work on the web, but I need it to work on my computer. And this buys

761
00:45:37,165 --> 00:45:40,965
Speaker 5:  Microsoft's such runway to like go after whatever is next because

762
00:45:41,145 --> 00:45:44,845
Speaker 5:  you can either have a Windows machine or you can run a Windows machine

763
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:48,925
Speaker 5:  on any kind of screen. It just, it makes it so much stickier. I think this

764
00:45:48,925 --> 00:45:52,405
Speaker 5:  is so smart from Microsoft. Also, I have an answer to your parallels question.

765
00:45:52,565 --> 00:45:56,485
Speaker 5:  I googled it. Can I just read you the Bleakest sentence that I've read in

766
00:45:56,485 --> 00:45:56,685
Speaker 5:  a while?

767
00:45:57,005 --> 00:45:58,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You didn't Bing it.

768
00:45:58,205 --> 00:46:00,685
Speaker 5:  I cogged it if you really want to know, but we can come back to that later.

769
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:04,365
Speaker 5:  Wow. It says to run Windows 11 and it's applications on a Mac with Apple

770
00:46:04,365 --> 00:46:07,765
Speaker 5:  silicon, you need to install an ARM-based image of Windows 11 that can run

771
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,445
Speaker 5:  the majority of Intel-based Windows 11 applications by using a built-in emulator

772
00:46:12,785 --> 00:46:13,005
Speaker 5:  wwo.

773
00:46:14,155 --> 00:46:14,445
Speaker 4:  Whoa.

774
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:18,485
Speaker 5:  It's it's like a hat on a hat on a hat to get parallel. We're Whoa,

775
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:21,485
Speaker 4:  That's brutal. I'm just sending her the link to Windows app

776
00:46:22,265 --> 00:46:23,485
Speaker 4:  seeing what happens next.

777
00:46:25,155 --> 00:46:29,125
Speaker 4:  There's like one application that makes the entire one part of

778
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:32,725
Speaker 4:  the legal system in New York State go, is it word perfect? And it's just

779
00:46:32,725 --> 00:46:36,485
Speaker 4:  like one dude made one app and all the lawyers use it. And that's the whole

780
00:46:36,725 --> 00:46:37,405
Speaker 4:  industry. That's

781
00:46:37,405 --> 00:46:40,965
Speaker 5:  Such a perfect example because every industry has one of those.

782
00:46:41,275 --> 00:46:44,845
Speaker 5:  They all run on Windows and they all have not been updated in 15 years. And

783
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:48,285
Speaker 5:  like Nila, you and I have both spent time with Windows executives over the

784
00:46:48,285 --> 00:46:51,925
Speaker 5:  years who are like desperate to figure out how to solve that problem because

785
00:46:51,925 --> 00:46:55,485
Speaker 5:  they're like, we can't move forward in the ways that we know we need to move

786
00:46:55,485 --> 00:46:59,405
Speaker 5:  forward and also continue to support the like

787
00:46:59,445 --> 00:47:02,805
Speaker 5:  hundreds of millions of users who use 15 year old software and need it to

788
00:47:02,805 --> 00:47:06,445
Speaker 5:  do their jobs. And like this, this is one

789
00:47:06,905 --> 00:47:10,445
Speaker 5:  big step in bridging that gap in a really smart way.

790
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:14,205
Speaker 4:  When I called that company, which is like, again, like four people, and I

791
00:47:14,205 --> 00:47:17,325
Speaker 4:  said, Hey, I'm installing this in Parallels in a Mac. They just moved through

792
00:47:17,645 --> 00:47:21,565
Speaker 4:  a worksheet because so many of their customers are people

793
00:47:21,565 --> 00:47:25,445
Speaker 4:  who want to use Max. Yeah. and they need this one app. and they

794
00:47:25,445 --> 00:47:27,445
Speaker 4:  were just like, they were just ready for me. The the

795
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:30,925
Speaker 6:  One I ran into is for the longest time, if you wanted to, like,

796
00:47:31,235 --> 00:47:34,605
Speaker 6:  there's this thing called Beef Checkoff and it for cattle and stuff. And

797
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:35,525
Speaker 6:  it's, it's this whole

798
00:47:35,545 --> 00:47:37,005
Speaker 4:  Not beef check the Sam Scheffer story.

799
00:47:37,035 --> 00:47:40,245
Speaker 6:  Totally different. And, and it's, it's very complicated. I'm not gonna get

800
00:47:40,245 --> 00:47:42,885
Speaker 6:  into all of it, but basically you have to scan these tags in order to like

801
00:47:43,085 --> 00:47:45,605
Speaker 6:  register the cattle and make sure that they've been like processed and, and

802
00:47:45,745 --> 00:47:48,365
Speaker 6:  had all their shots and all of that stuff before we slaughter them and eat

803
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:52,205
Speaker 6:  them in delicious burgers. And the software, there's two competing

804
00:47:52,445 --> 00:47:56,365
Speaker 6:  software and the more popular software is cheaper and only runs on

805
00:47:56,365 --> 00:47:57,245
Speaker 6:  Windows 98.

806
00:47:58,275 --> 00:47:58,565
Speaker 4:  Ouch.

807
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:02,525
Speaker 6:  And so people are like carrying around ancient ass Dell laptops

808
00:48:02,525 --> 00:48:06,165
Speaker 6:  and stuff and I think they've start, most of them have moved off. There's

809
00:48:06,165 --> 00:48:09,005
Speaker 6:  very few people left on it, but those very few are like, it's just so much

810
00:48:09,005 --> 00:48:11,885
Speaker 6:  cheaper. Yeah. It's just so much easier. And you're like, but you are,

811
00:48:12,235 --> 00:48:14,765
Speaker 4:  This is like IMAX running on, on Palm Pilots. Yeah.

812
00:48:14,915 --> 00:48:16,325
Speaker 6:  What are you doing? Stop

813
00:48:16,325 --> 00:48:19,525
Speaker 4:  It. They're doing, they're just making America Run. Yeah, they're, they're,

814
00:48:19,525 --> 00:48:22,685
Speaker 4:  they're making burgers, blue bubbles. It's livestock

815
00:48:23,315 --> 00:48:26,725
Speaker 4:  pick up trucks. It's all the same thing. All right. Let's take a break. We'll

816
00:48:26,725 --> 00:48:27,965
Speaker 4:  come back, we'll do a little bit of lightning round

817
00:50:38,395 --> 00:50:41,095
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back before the lightning round. I do wanna, there's one

818
00:50:41,095 --> 00:50:45,055
Speaker 4:  thing I wanna talk about. YouTube this week rolled out a

819
00:50:45,055 --> 00:50:48,935
Speaker 4:  new defect policy. It's very early. We talk to them about

820
00:50:48,935 --> 00:50:52,535
Speaker 4:  it for a while. On YouTube, there's two, there's gonna be two classes

821
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:56,335
Speaker 4:  of people who get deep faked. There's

822
00:50:56,775 --> 00:51:00,375
Speaker 4:  musicians who are basically not allowed to get deep faked if they are on

823
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:04,255
Speaker 4:  a label that is partnered with YouTube. Your musician in your label isn't

824
00:51:04,455 --> 00:51:08,375
Speaker 4:  with YouTube, all betts are off. But if you're a musician on

825
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:12,095
Speaker 4:  a label partner with YouTube or the family of a dead musician on a label

826
00:51:12,095 --> 00:51:14,375
Speaker 4:  partner with YouTube, no DeepFakes, do

827
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:18,135
Speaker 5:  You mean like deep fake videos or like the, the

828
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:20,335
Speaker 5:  AI covers We've been seeing all over the place.

829
00:51:20,635 --> 00:51:24,535
Speaker 4:  The AI covers. Okay. Okay. Any It's unique rapping or singing

830
00:51:24,535 --> 00:51:24,855
Speaker 4:  voice.

831
00:51:25,075 --> 00:51:28,335
Speaker 5:  The thing where you can sound like Drake is, is what? They're cranky.

832
00:51:28,525 --> 00:51:32,135
Speaker 4:  It's not allowed on YouTube. Be Drake. And I will tell you and ly this is

833
00:51:32,135 --> 00:51:36,055
Speaker 4:  very public universal music. Drake's label Noisily

834
00:51:36,055 --> 00:51:39,895
Speaker 4:  announced with YouTube that they're doing a deal so like a while ago.

835
00:51:39,895 --> 00:51:43,335
Speaker 4:  So it's like very obvious, like fake Drake is no longer allowed in no exceptions.

836
00:51:43,335 --> 00:51:47,095
Speaker 4:  Alright, she bong. There's one, there's one tiny exception. If you make a

837
00:51:47,095 --> 00:51:50,975
Speaker 4:  video that is news commentary or analysis. Yes. You can have a little

838
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:53,055
Speaker 4:  bit of So we we're good, we're good. Or

839
00:51:53,065 --> 00:51:53,815
Speaker 6:  Laser vong

840
00:51:53,975 --> 00:51:55,135
Speaker 4:  Continues. Play play laser bong right now.

841
00:51:55,135 --> 00:51:59,015
Speaker 5:  What if it's just like sick? Like what if it's just like really good and

842
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:02,055
Speaker 5:  Drake is like, you know what, you can have this one. Yeah.

843
00:52:02,195 --> 00:52:06,175
Speaker 4:  So there's no I there's no automated enforcement of this yet. You gotta fill

844
00:52:06,175 --> 00:52:09,175
Speaker 4:  out the form. So Drake could presumably choose not to fill out the form.

845
00:52:09,795 --> 00:52:10,735
Speaker 4:  That's, that's what I got for

846
00:52:10,735 --> 00:52:14,615
Speaker 6:  You. They make Drake do it himself. Drake like, Drake, watch this song.

847
00:52:14,675 --> 00:52:15,135
Speaker 6:  Do you like it

848
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:19,135
Speaker 4:  Aubrey? Sir, can you, we brought you a pen. We brought you this

849
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:22,655
Speaker 4:  Windows 98 application. Yeah. To fill out this, this YouTube form.

850
00:52:22,995 --> 00:52:26,495
Speaker 4:  So that's, that's one class of people. Super protected, no

851
00:52:26,955 --> 00:52:30,335
Speaker 4:  AI voices for rapping and singing. Yeah. If you're on a label that's partnering

852
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:34,015
Speaker 4:  with YouTube, everybody else, all kinds of

853
00:52:34,015 --> 00:52:37,575
Speaker 4:  exceptions, right? Parody, satire, all the stuff like

854
00:52:37,885 --> 00:52:41,735
Speaker 4:  whether you're a famous person or not, you get less protections and all of

855
00:52:41,735 --> 00:52:45,575
Speaker 4:  that looks like fair use. Like that is the fair use analysis.

856
00:52:45,805 --> 00:52:49,775
Speaker 4:  Only. Instead of courts doing it, YouTube is gonna do it and they don't

857
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:52,935
Speaker 4:  know how they're gonna do it yet. So like right now there's a controversy

858
00:52:52,935 --> 00:52:56,655
Speaker 4:  about React videos. There's always a controversy about react videos because

859
00:52:56,655 --> 00:52:57,255
Speaker 6:  They're garbage.

860
00:52:57,605 --> 00:53:01,375
Speaker 4:  Well, there there's something, right? And the, the controversy

861
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:05,215
Speaker 4:  to boil, I'm gonna try to sum up the controversy without getting us into

862
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:08,295
Speaker 4:  the controversy ourselves. People make react videos. They're like, you made

863
00:53:08,295 --> 00:53:11,775
Speaker 4:  a video. Someone else is just making faces. Sometimes they reuse the faces,

864
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:14,815
Speaker 4:  they're not even reacting. It's just clips of faces

865
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:19,535
Speaker 4:  and then they, they steal the views, which is a big deal on YouTube. 'cause

866
00:53:19,535 --> 00:53:23,055
Speaker 4:  that means you're, you move the money, people get very upset about this

867
00:53:23,435 --> 00:53:26,445
Speaker 4:  and you, there's one whole kind of of conversation you could have about it.

868
00:53:26,545 --> 00:53:29,845
Speaker 4:  But the conversation that gets had the most frequently is a conversation

869
00:53:29,845 --> 00:53:33,485
Speaker 4:  about copyright law. Why? Because the only thing that can get

870
00:53:33,485 --> 00:53:36,525
Speaker 4:  content removed from the internet reliably is copyright law. It's the only

871
00:53:36,725 --> 00:53:39,805
Speaker 4:  functional speech regulation on the internet. And you look at YouTube and

872
00:53:39,805 --> 00:53:43,605
Speaker 4:  how it handles copier law, it just, nope, out of the conversation.

873
00:53:44,155 --> 00:53:48,125
Speaker 4:  Like you send a copyright DMCA request to YouTube, they tell the person

874
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:50,725
Speaker 4:  that you've sent the request to, that person can respond and say, nah, that's

875
00:53:50,725 --> 00:53:53,645
Speaker 4:  not right. And then YouTube says, boy, you guys disagree, you should go to

876
00:53:53,645 --> 00:53:57,525
Speaker 4:  court. And that is, that is the end of YouTube's involvement. Right?

877
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:00,845
Speaker 4:  They will pass some emails back and forth between you and they will

878
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:05,485
Speaker 4:  do their legal obligation to, it's called notice and take down. Like, but

879
00:54:05,485 --> 00:54:08,645
Speaker 4:  they will not substantively decide if something is fair use.

880
00:54:09,155 --> 00:54:13,125
Speaker 4:  They'll, they will just say, go have your lawyers figured out with DeepFakes.

881
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:16,485
Speaker 4:  There's no copyright law yet. There's no court cases, there's nothing,

882
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:20,725
Speaker 4:  there's no law against DeepFakes, there's no federal li right of

883
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:23,965
Speaker 4:  publicity or likeness. So YouTube is bringing it in-house

884
00:54:25,475 --> 00:54:29,295
Speaker 4:  the same way that YouTube will say, we have rules against things like

885
00:54:29,295 --> 00:54:33,215
Speaker 4:  Covid misinformation or election denial or whatever. And you're like, and

886
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,975
Speaker 4:  how well is that going?

887
00:54:34,795 --> 00:54:35,495
Speaker 6:  Are you doing buddy?

888
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:38,935
Speaker 4:  Like right. It's just as messy. It's super opaque.

889
00:54:39,715 --> 00:54:43,295
Speaker 4:  No one knows how It works. They're not gonna publish any like precedent.

890
00:54:43,525 --> 00:54:47,215
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They're not gonna have court opinions. You know, I and YouTube's worry

891
00:54:47,215 --> 00:54:49,975
Speaker 4:  quite rightly is if they do that, people will try to game it and find the

892
00:54:49,975 --> 00:54:52,335
Speaker 4:  boundaries. So they don't wanna do it, but then they're gonna have to do

893
00:54:52,335 --> 00:54:55,615
Speaker 4:  it. 'cause now there's gonna be DeepFakes what is a parody?

894
00:54:56,395 --> 00:54:59,775
Speaker 4:  It, it certainly can't be music because the labels have negotiated themselves

895
00:54:59,845 --> 00:55:03,735
Speaker 4:  more protections. So you just keep winding through this and one of the, one

896
00:55:03,735 --> 00:55:07,695
Speaker 4:  of the rules you're gonna have is that you have to label realistic AI generated

897
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:10,375
Speaker 4:  content. Especially of like news events. You

898
00:55:10,395 --> 00:55:11,935
Speaker 5:  The creator, right? You're like,

899
00:55:11,995 --> 00:55:13,135
Speaker 4:  You the creator on upload.

900
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:17,015
Speaker 5:  If I do a bad AI cover, I'm good. But if I do a good

901
00:55:17,155 --> 00:55:19,935
Speaker 5:  AI cover, I have to tell YouTube that I did a good AI cover.

902
00:55:19,955 --> 00:55:22,575
Speaker 4:  No you, you're not allowed to do AI covers at all. 'cause the music labels

903
00:55:22,575 --> 00:55:23,535
Speaker 4:  have forbidden it. So

904
00:55:23,535 --> 00:55:24,975
Speaker 5:  What am I, what am I labeling?

905
00:55:25,275 --> 00:55:29,015
Speaker 4:  So you make a video that's like how the Titanic really sunk and it's just

906
00:55:29,275 --> 00:55:32,255
Speaker 4:  AI generated boat sinking. You have to label it

907
00:55:33,155 --> 00:55:34,055
Speaker 4:  to be like, this is fake

908
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:37,935
Speaker 5:  So. I can't do Drake's at all. Like, but I can do the Titanic.

909
00:55:38,095 --> 00:55:39,935
Speaker 5:  I just have to say this is fake Titanic. You

910
00:55:39,935 --> 00:55:42,975
Speaker 4:  Can't, yeah, you can't do Drake, but you can do Trump. Here's,

911
00:55:42,975 --> 00:55:43,455
Speaker 6:  Here's my

912
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:46,095
Speaker 4:  Question. 'cause Trump didn't negotiate a label deal with YouTube.

913
00:55:46,395 --> 00:55:49,855
Speaker 6:  Here's my question. There's a YouTube channel right now and all they do is

914
00:55:50,135 --> 00:55:53,455
Speaker 6:  a movie, a new movie announced like a big movie. They announced the cast.

915
00:55:53,455 --> 00:55:56,895
Speaker 6:  Everybody's like, oh cool, this this YouTube channel then goes and makes

916
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:00,615
Speaker 6:  an AI generated trailer. And I just watched one for today

917
00:56:00,715 --> 00:56:04,495
Speaker 6:  for Moana starring Zendaya and the Rock.

918
00:56:04,715 --> 00:56:05,135
Speaker 4:  Oh my.

919
00:56:05,515 --> 00:56:09,095
Speaker 6:  And it had like a horrifying AI rock

920
00:56:09,225 --> 00:56:12,895
Speaker 6:  where his face is like morphing. Yeah. And he's also the guy from

921
00:56:13,145 --> 00:56:13,935
Speaker 6:  Moana. And so,

922
00:56:14,155 --> 00:56:18,095
Speaker 4:  So two things. One on upload that creator would have to say, okay,

923
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:21,975
Speaker 4:  this is AI generated. And then two, through some process

924
00:56:22,835 --> 00:56:26,765
Speaker 4:  the Rock could submit a form to YouTube and say, I want

925
00:56:26,765 --> 00:56:30,565
Speaker 4:  this taken down. This is a deep fake of my likeness. And then YouTube

926
00:56:30,565 --> 00:56:34,045
Speaker 4:  will go through some analysis. Yeah. Which will be completely opaque

927
00:56:34,385 --> 00:56:37,645
Speaker 4:  and make a decision and it will not say why it made those decisions. Interesting.

928
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:40,125
Speaker 5:  Third of all, live action Moana is gonna kick ass.

929
00:56:40,435 --> 00:56:44,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Fourth of all Disney is just milking the shit outta these

930
00:56:44,565 --> 00:56:46,325
Speaker 4:  franchises. Wait, but like, so we don't know.

931
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:48,845
Speaker 5:  Isn't this just a content ID thing, right? Like YouTube is

932
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:52,365
Speaker 4:  No, 'cause they don't know they can't do it. They've said to us, they're

933
00:56:52,365 --> 00:56:56,165
Speaker 4:  investing in the tools to detect AI generated content. Those tools basically

934
00:56:56,165 --> 00:56:57,645
Speaker 4:  do not exist now. Yeah.

935
00:56:57,885 --> 00:57:00,685
Speaker 6:  Computers can't recognize computers versus humans.

936
00:57:01,245 --> 00:57:05,125
Speaker 4:  I think you can do it in photo and video and audio to some extent. You, it's

937
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:08,205
Speaker 4:  really hard in text. A OpenAI tried to have had a tool that tried to do it

938
00:57:08,205 --> 00:57:12,045
Speaker 4:  in text and they pulled it 'cause it was so unreliable. Yeah. Photo and video

939
00:57:12,045 --> 00:57:13,725
Speaker 4:  and audio may maybe, maybe.

940
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:17,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean this one was very clearly like, oh, people's faces don't melt

941
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:18,885
Speaker 6:  like that when they're supposed to be smiling

942
00:57:19,055 --> 00:57:22,205
Speaker 4:  There. There's some stuff and there's some tip offs and, and maybe the content

943
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:25,045
Speaker 4:  authenticity initiative will do watermarking. But there's all this stuff

944
00:57:25,045 --> 00:57:25,485
Speaker 4:  you can do

945
00:57:25,865 --> 00:57:29,445
Speaker 5:  Is the thing that YouTube actually launched here. Basically just like a form

946
00:57:29,545 --> 00:57:32,845
Speaker 5:  you can fill out to be mad at a video if you're a record label. Yeah.

947
00:57:32,845 --> 00:57:36,565
Speaker 4:  It's a form you can fill out on upload saying I made this with ai and then

948
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:40,405
Speaker 4:  two forms, one that says I'm a major label artist partnered with YouTube,

949
00:57:40,405 --> 00:57:44,005
Speaker 4:  take this down. And another one that says, I'm not a major label artist partnered

950
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:46,525
Speaker 4:  with YouTube. Please take this down. Okay. and they have different rules

951
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:50,325
Speaker 5:  With the promise of technology to come in the middle

952
00:57:50,325 --> 00:57:51,885
Speaker 4:  Care somewhere. Yeah. Somewhere in here. All this will happen.

953
00:57:51,985 --> 00:57:55,685
Speaker 6:  Do you think we're gonna get actors in in, in studios doing it too?

954
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:57,005
Speaker 6:  No. I

955
00:57:57,195 --> 00:58:00,885
Speaker 4:  Just You gotta go make it the the thing is there's no law. Yeah. There's

956
00:58:00,885 --> 00:58:04,645
Speaker 4:  just YouTube and its business partners desperately trying to get ahead of

957
00:58:04,645 --> 00:58:08,325
Speaker 4:  this problem. And you can see the business pressures are

958
00:58:08,325 --> 00:58:12,205
Speaker 4:  leading to unequal treatment. YouTube desperately needs

959
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:16,285
Speaker 4:  major labels to be happy. They're gonna get they here they are, they have

960
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:20,165
Speaker 4:  gotten special treatment. Okay. Maybe YouTube needs Hollywood to be happy.

961
00:58:20,315 --> 00:58:23,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The next turn will be if you are an actor

962
00:58:23,685 --> 00:58:27,565
Speaker 4:  associated with a movie produced by one of our film studio partners.

963
00:58:28,095 --> 00:58:29,845
Speaker 4:  We'll give you the no exceptions rule.

964
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:33,885
Speaker 6:  I'm just thinking of which, like up and coming YouTube artist

965
00:58:34,465 --> 00:58:37,725
Speaker 6:  who doesn't, hasn't signed with a major label. I can like whole scale rip

966
00:58:37,725 --> 00:58:37,925
Speaker 6:  off.

967
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:39,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah, they're coming. I'm

968
00:58:39,525 --> 00:58:40,205
Speaker 6:  Gonna make so much money.

969
00:58:40,345 --> 00:58:43,805
Speaker 4:  So I asked a follow-up question, which we'll put on the site. It's not on

970
00:58:43,805 --> 00:58:47,245
Speaker 4:  the site yet. Maybe by the time you listen to this it will be that means

971
00:58:47,285 --> 00:58:50,685
Speaker 4:  I have to do it. But here is my question that I asked.

972
00:58:51,235 --> 00:58:55,205
Speaker 4:  What if you take a Pixel eight photo and you run it through Best Take and

973
00:58:55,205 --> 00:58:58,925
Speaker 4:  now you've got a synthetic ultra realistic photo that was

974
00:58:58,925 --> 00:59:02,365
Speaker 4:  partially generated by ai. Will YouTube require that to be labeled?

975
00:59:02,945 --> 00:59:05,325
Speaker 6:  Can YouTube block you in email form?

976
00:59:05,835 --> 00:59:09,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They're like, here's our story. We're taking you down. Yeah.

977
00:59:09,315 --> 00:59:09,605
Speaker 6:  Just

978
00:59:09,605 --> 00:59:12,085
Speaker 4:  Blocked. Well, no, so this, I mean, but this is the problem, right? You're

979
00:59:12,085 --> 00:59:15,925
Speaker 4:  gonna run dead into your own tools. If you are Google and you

980
00:59:15,925 --> 00:59:19,845
Speaker 4:  run YouTube and you need these rules and then the rest of Google is

981
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:23,805
Speaker 4:  just running full speed ahead at AI generated content, you are gonna

982
00:59:23,805 --> 00:59:27,445
Speaker 4:  quickly run into, I can take a series of photos with my Pixel

983
00:59:27,455 --> 00:59:30,765
Speaker 4:  phone and then I can just make things happen that never

984
00:59:31,005 --> 00:59:34,965
Speaker 5:  Happened. I mean, forget that I can, I can type into a prompt in any

985
00:59:34,965 --> 00:59:38,845
Speaker 5:  number of Google products to make the exact thing that is now not

986
00:59:38,845 --> 00:59:42,565
Speaker 5:  allowed on YouTube. Yeah. Like I can get Google to spit out

987
00:59:42,705 --> 00:59:45,565
Speaker 5:  the thing through its image generators and Yeah.

988
00:59:45,565 --> 00:59:47,845
Speaker 4:  But that's like you're at least doing it, right? You're like, I'm gonna go

989
00:59:47,845 --> 00:59:51,765
Speaker 4:  to an AI content tool and it's going to, I think best take is

990
00:59:51,765 --> 00:59:53,525
Speaker 4:  on the, the blurries of possible.

991
00:59:53,795 --> 00:59:55,205
Speaker 5:  Sure. That's fair. Right?

992
00:59:55,205 --> 00:59:58,085
Speaker 4:  It's like these photos sort of really happened but they didn't really happen.

993
00:59:58,145 --> 01:00:02,005
Speaker 4:  And now I can like if you wa go, I encourage everyone to go watch the ad

994
01:00:02,075 --> 01:00:03,685
Speaker 4:  that Google is running for Best take.

995
01:00:03,865 --> 01:00:06,685
Speaker 5:  But Best Take doesn't make your photos look like the Rock is in it.

996
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:10,525
Speaker 4:  Right. But they could, but they are showing in best take in the ads they're

997
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:14,445
Speaker 4:  running now they are showing people like go from looking at

998
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:18,405
Speaker 4:  one another to not looking at one another or from smiling to looking at the

999
01:00:18,405 --> 01:00:22,125
Speaker 4:  rock to looking like Right. Like just the basics of a photo.

1000
01:00:22,155 --> 01:00:25,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Who was looking at what, in what direction? When is

1001
01:00:25,965 --> 01:00:28,645
Speaker 4:  that person smiling or frowning? Well you can just

1002
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:33,565
Speaker 4:  concoct a a moment with Best Take. Yeah. And it's in the advertising.

1003
01:00:33,565 --> 01:00:37,045
Speaker 4:  It's not this I, I know everyone thinks I'm overreacting. I'm saying watch

1004
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:40,885
Speaker 4:  the ad. This is what Google is saying is you can do in their own marketing.

1005
01:00:41,425 --> 01:00:45,045
Speaker 4:  So I asked YouTube, here's the response. The goal of this update is helping

1006
01:00:45,045 --> 01:00:48,285
Speaker 4:  the viewer to be better informed about content that is realistic but altered

1007
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:52,325
Speaker 4:  not punishing creators for using ai. There isn't a single standard we can

1008
01:00:52,325 --> 01:00:55,045
Speaker 4:  give you that will apply every case. And as with all decisions like this,

1009
01:00:55,045 --> 01:00:58,685
Speaker 4:  context matters. If you're using Best take to pick an image where everyone's

1010
01:00:58,685 --> 01:01:01,765
Speaker 4:  eyes are open, you could have probably done that yourself by taking more

1011
01:01:01,765 --> 01:01:05,645
Speaker 4:  photos and likely not something you need to disclose. But if you're using

1012
01:01:05,645 --> 01:01:07,845
Speaker 4:  the tech to make it seem like you were in a place that you actually weren't

1013
01:01:07,945 --> 01:01:11,285
Speaker 4:  or altering a photo of a historic event, you'll probably need to disclose

1014
01:01:11,285 --> 01:01:13,285
Speaker 4:  to your viewers that use technology to alter the setting.

1015
01:01:13,705 --> 01:01:17,525
Speaker 5:  That's so many words that literally like to just translate

1016
01:01:17,525 --> 01:01:20,445
Speaker 5:  from corporate speak to real words is like don don't know.

1017
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:22,165
Speaker 4:  That's

1018
01:01:22,165 --> 01:01:24,925
Speaker 5:  What, that's what that says is like, ah, Maybe. it could be

1019
01:01:24,925 --> 01:01:28,685
Speaker 4:  Right if if the standard is, if you just took infinite photos,

1020
01:01:28,825 --> 01:01:30,605
Speaker 4:  you could have gotten this moment. The

1021
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:32,125
Speaker 5:  Rock would probably be in one of them.

1022
01:01:33,155 --> 01:01:37,045
Speaker 4:  It's like, I'm just gonna stand here shooting photos until the rock shows

1023
01:01:37,045 --> 01:01:38,165
Speaker 4:  up. It's

1024
01:01:40,545 --> 01:01:44,285
Speaker 4:  is that, is that a realistic standard? I think that's a great

1025
01:01:44,725 --> 01:01:48,205
Speaker 4:  standard. Anyway. I'm like I am fascinated. I I told

1026
01:01:48,275 --> 01:01:52,165
Speaker 4:  YouTube I will tell everyone this question is why The Verge exists.

1027
01:01:52,755 --> 01:01:56,205
Speaker 4:  Like I'm endlessly fascinated by this question, especially for a company

1028
01:01:56,205 --> 01:02:00,005
Speaker 4:  like Google, which is full speed ahead making the tools

1029
01:02:00,705 --> 01:02:04,485
Speaker 4:  and running the platform that will be the most impacted by the

1030
01:02:04,485 --> 01:02:08,285
Speaker 4:  tools. To the same point, YouTube

1031
01:02:08,575 --> 01:02:12,325
Speaker 4:  today announced a tool where singers

1032
01:02:12,425 --> 01:02:16,245
Speaker 4:  can let you use AI clones with their voices just like

1033
01:02:16,245 --> 01:02:19,325
Speaker 4:  running 50 different directions at once. At once.

1034
01:02:19,325 --> 01:02:21,845
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna, anyone can use my voice for singing.

1035
01:02:22,195 --> 01:02:25,485
Speaker 4:  It's very good. I'm telling you again, this is why the The Verge exists.

1036
01:02:25,555 --> 01:02:29,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like, I don't know, no one knows the answers to these questions, but

1037
01:02:29,165 --> 01:02:31,725
Speaker 4:  I do know that if you stand on any street corner or any major city in the

1038
01:02:31,725 --> 01:02:35,405
Speaker 4:  world and just start shooting photos, statistically the rock will be in one

1039
01:02:35,405 --> 01:02:35,805
Speaker 4:  of those photos.

1040
01:02:36,115 --> 01:02:37,845
Speaker 5:  Even eventually the rock will appear.

1041
01:02:39,235 --> 01:02:43,165
Speaker 4:  Alright, we should do a lightning round. Yeah. David, you have

1042
01:02:43,165 --> 01:02:46,045
Speaker 4:  not yet talked about this, this silly nothing thing. Do you want that to

1043
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:48,245
Speaker 4:  be a a outta the lightning round or you just wanna do it?

1044
01:02:48,305 --> 01:02:51,325
Speaker 5:  No, let's do that now. That's good. Okay. Which means I get to have two lightning

1045
01:02:51,325 --> 01:02:54,125
Speaker 5:  round things. All, right. I'm gonna, I'm gonna pull a Neli is what we call

1046
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:54,765
Speaker 5:  that the

1047
01:02:54,765 --> 01:02:58,485
Speaker 4:  Lightning round. By the way, we are so bad at this. The lightning round is

1048
01:02:58,565 --> 01:03:01,285
Speaker 4:  supposed to be like we do lots of things really fast and instead it's like

1049
01:03:01,285 --> 01:03:04,845
Speaker 4:  we're gonna do three and they're all gonna take 20 minutes. Yeah, yeah.

1050
01:03:04,995 --> 01:03:05,845
Speaker 6:  It's a kind of lightning

1051
01:03:05,845 --> 01:03:08,565
Speaker 5:  Which is again, I would say we're, we're willing to rebrand for the right

1052
01:03:08,565 --> 01:03:12,325
Speaker 5:  sponsor. Like I've gone from sponsor us for the lightning round to sponsors

1053
01:03:12,325 --> 01:03:13,645
Speaker 5:  for anything you

1054
01:03:13,645 --> 01:03:14,725
Speaker 6:  Wanna call it the triple play,

1055
01:03:15,075 --> 01:03:15,965
Speaker 5:  Call it whatever you want.

1056
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:21,365
Speaker 4:  All. right? The disclosures are about to be outta control. We just go ahead

1057
01:03:21,435 --> 01:03:22,125
Speaker 4:  talk about nothing.

1058
01:03:22,635 --> 01:03:26,445
Speaker 5:  Okay. So the other part of the messaging news this week was that

1059
01:03:26,445 --> 01:03:29,965
Speaker 5:  nothing the, the phone maker that we've talked a lot about on the show, they

1060
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:34,005
Speaker 5:  released this thing called Nothing Chats. And the big thing that it does

1061
01:03:34,585 --> 01:03:38,085
Speaker 5:  is make it so that you can send Blue Bubble iMessage

1062
01:03:38,085 --> 01:03:41,765
Speaker 5:  messages from your nothing phone. It only works on the Nothing Phone

1063
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:45,645
Speaker 5:  two. And It works through a company called Sunbird, which has been sort of

1064
01:03:46,305 --> 01:03:50,125
Speaker 5:  loudly proclaiming the technology it has developed for a long time. But it's

1065
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:53,965
Speaker 5:  basically, it's an elaborate hack of iMessage and essentially

1066
01:03:53,965 --> 01:03:57,805
Speaker 5:  what it does is they put a Mac

1067
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:01,605
Speaker 5:  mini into a server rack somewhere and you

1068
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:05,405
Speaker 5:  create your iCloud account on that Mac Mini

1069
01:04:05,945 --> 01:04:09,765
Speaker 5:  on a server somewhere. And then that becomes the relay for you to

1070
01:04:09,965 --> 01:04:13,525
Speaker 5:  send and receive messages. This is janky as hell for a hundred reasons.

1071
01:04:14,315 --> 01:04:18,085
Speaker 5:  It's a security disaster because now all of your messages just live on a

1072
01:04:18,245 --> 01:04:20,005
Speaker 5:  computer that you have no access to and

1073
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:22,485
Speaker 4:  Your iCloud password lives on someone's computer.

1074
01:04:22,745 --> 01:04:26,725
Speaker 5:  Yes. It's not good don't do this. But I

1075
01:04:26,725 --> 01:04:29,725
Speaker 5:  mean do it if you want but like do it eyes wide open knowing what's going

1076
01:04:29,725 --> 01:04:33,325
Speaker 4:  On here. Do it with a burner iCloud account that only says, ha ha,

1077
01:04:33,605 --> 01:04:34,485
Speaker 4:  I know you're the cops.

1078
01:04:34,945 --> 01:04:38,645
Speaker 5:  So this is the beauty of this, which is you kind of have to

1079
01:04:39,445 --> 01:04:43,405
Speaker 5:  'cause because the way that It works, it can't associate with your

1080
01:04:43,405 --> 01:04:46,365
Speaker 5:  phone if you have an Android phone, you can't register it as an iPhone with

1081
01:04:46,365 --> 01:04:50,285
Speaker 5:  iCloud. So you have to set it up with your email and then it

1082
01:04:50,285 --> 01:04:54,125
Speaker 5:  does this weird thing where it, the first thing it sends you is basically

1083
01:04:54,205 --> 01:04:57,605
Speaker 5:  a contact merge to try to put your email into

1084
01:04:58,195 --> 01:05:01,845
Speaker 5:  your contact card with your phone number so that it all looks like it's coming

1085
01:05:01,845 --> 01:05:05,805
Speaker 5:  from you. Even though it's just coming from an email address. And it is

1086
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:09,925
Speaker 5:  confusing and messy but still kind of interesting. And I think like

1087
01:05:10,195 --> 01:05:14,125
Speaker 5:  says more about both, nothing being interested in like Needling Apple

1088
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:18,325
Speaker 5:  and also the lengths people will go to to be Blue Bubbles,

1089
01:05:18,325 --> 01:05:21,605
Speaker 5:  especially in the United States, like this is very clearly a ploy for nothing

1090
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:25,485
Speaker 5:  to sell more phones in the US where it's very hard to sell a phone that

1091
01:05:25,495 --> 01:05:29,405
Speaker 5:  isn't a blue bubble. And it's, it's messy and there are better

1092
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:32,765
Speaker 5:  ways to do it. And there's a bunch of these things out there now. Like Beeper

1093
01:05:32,765 --> 01:05:36,685
Speaker 5:  is doing something very similar with Mac Mini's and iMessage. There's this

1094
01:05:36,685 --> 01:05:40,285
Speaker 5:  app text.com that just got bought by Matt Mullenweg and Automatic,

1095
01:05:40,675 --> 01:05:44,485
Speaker 5:  they have a different security system where because it lives on your device,

1096
01:05:44,515 --> 01:05:48,085
Speaker 5:  it's actually connecting locally to your computer. But that means it doesn't

1097
01:05:48,085 --> 01:05:50,525
Speaker 5:  work on mobile and they're having to do a bunch of work to get it to work

1098
01:05:50,525 --> 01:05:53,805
Speaker 5:  on mobile. So it's everybody's hacking around it and they're all making the

1099
01:05:54,005 --> 01:05:57,845
Speaker 5:  same bet, which is that like Apple won't pick this fight because it's bad

1100
01:05:57,945 --> 01:06:01,045
Speaker 5:  PR for Apple to pick this fight. Yeah. And I think that's probably true,

1101
01:06:01,145 --> 01:06:04,805
Speaker 5:  but I also think Apple could essentially wipe this all

1102
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:08,245
Speaker 5:  away in 10 minutes if it felt like it and

1103
01:06:08,795 --> 01:06:09,285
Speaker 5:  without

1104
01:06:09,525 --> 01:06:13,045
Speaker 4:  Question. We'll see. Yeah. But I do think the idea that nothing

1105
01:06:13,445 --> 01:06:17,085
Speaker 4:  pressured Apple into making any decisions, which is what nothing would like

1106
01:06:17,085 --> 01:06:17,365
Speaker 4:  you to

1107
01:06:17,365 --> 01:06:17,525
Speaker 5:  Believe.

1108
01:06:17,825 --> 01:06:21,605
Speaker 4:  Lunacy. And you should not sign up for this. don don't, don don't know how

1109
01:06:21,995 --> 01:06:25,965
Speaker 4:  much more I can say you should not send your messages through an insecure

1110
01:06:25,975 --> 01:06:27,285
Speaker 4:  third party. I mean

1111
01:06:27,305 --> 01:06:31,045
Speaker 6:  If you, I think you should because then one day I'm gonna

1112
01:06:31,245 --> 01:06:34,165
Speaker 6:  get access to those messages and read them on The Vergecast,

1113
01:06:34,345 --> 01:06:37,445
Speaker 4:  Here's a very bad piece of Supreme Court precedent that you can just all

1114
01:06:37,445 --> 01:06:41,285
Speaker 4:  muddle over. Okay. It's called the third party doctrine. States just very

1115
01:06:41,315 --> 01:06:45,005
Speaker 4:  bluntly that if you hand any of your information to a third party,

1116
01:06:45,505 --> 01:06:48,885
Speaker 4:  you have no expectation of privacy in that information anymore. And

1117
01:06:49,395 --> 01:06:51,565
Speaker 4:  this blow, that's why you should do this. This blows people's minds left

1118
01:06:51,565 --> 01:06:55,045
Speaker 4:  and right. You, you put something on a cloud server, you've, your

1119
01:06:55,075 --> 01:06:58,965
Speaker 4:  expectation of privacy is gone. And it's like, is that

1120
01:06:58,965 --> 01:07:02,885
Speaker 4:  true? Are we like, there's like the people who think that which is a bunch

1121
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:06,805
Speaker 4:  of judges and prosecutors and then there's everyone else and it's,

1122
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:08,565
Speaker 4:  it feels like those people should talk to me.

1123
01:07:08,565 --> 01:07:11,485
Speaker 6:  Wait, how does that work for things like lawyers

1124
01:07:12,155 --> 01:07:15,045
Speaker 6:  writing anything in Google, Google Docs or Microsoft Office? This

1125
01:07:15,045 --> 01:07:17,205
Speaker 4:  Is real, it's a real problem. Oof. It's a real problem.

1126
01:07:17,395 --> 01:07:19,085
Speaker 6:  This is why I'm not a lawyer. Yeah, it's too

1127
01:07:19,085 --> 01:07:22,845
Speaker 4:  Much work. It, I mean this is a problem in tech policy for 10 million years.

1128
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:26,245
Speaker 4:  But yeah, if you have something on Cloud server, they can go subpoena the,

1129
01:07:26,245 --> 01:07:30,205
Speaker 4:  the cloud server provider and there's no recourse 'cause of the third party

1130
01:07:30,485 --> 01:07:30,645
Speaker 4:  doctrine.

1131
01:07:31,065 --> 01:07:33,725
Speaker 6:  So yeah, everybody go, go use, go use this. Go

1132
01:07:33,725 --> 01:07:34,365
Speaker 4:  Use Sun Perk.

1133
01:07:34,605 --> 01:07:36,525
Speaker 6:  I I really wanna read all of your texts

1134
01:07:36,775 --> 01:07:39,725
Speaker 4:  Again. The only message you should ever send through this service is haha

1135
01:07:39,725 --> 01:07:42,925
Speaker 4:  cops you can't get me and you should just do that a hundred times a day.

1136
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:46,405
Speaker 4:  All, right? Alex, what's your plane? Hang around.

1137
01:07:46,795 --> 01:07:50,525
Speaker 6:  Mine is Antonio got to play with the PlayStation Portal

1138
01:07:50,905 --> 01:07:54,485
Speaker 6:  not to be confused with a PlayStation portable, otherwise known as the

1139
01:07:54,565 --> 01:07:58,085
Speaker 6:  PSP, which also had a little appearance this week. Ooh.

1140
01:07:58,185 --> 01:07:59,805
Speaker 5:  And was a much better device. Yeah,

1141
01:07:59,805 --> 01:08:03,285
Speaker 6:  It was a great device And it was in the trailer for Madame Webb,

1142
01:08:03,615 --> 01:08:07,165
Speaker 6:  which is a new Marvel film and you don't need to care about it,

1143
01:08:07,725 --> 01:08:11,685
Speaker 6:  but the trailer's really dumb. But so the PlayStation Portal is

1144
01:08:11,685 --> 01:08:15,340
Speaker 6:  the new device that plays all the PlayStation games from your PS five

1145
01:08:15,705 --> 01:08:19,645
Speaker 6:  on this little device in your house. Yeah, that's about

1146
01:08:19,645 --> 01:08:23,085
Speaker 6:  it. Yeah. It's got things like in airplane mode, but

1147
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:25,325
Speaker 6:  you don't need airplane mode because

1148
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:27,605
Speaker 4:  Doesn't it only work on wifi? Yeah.

1149
01:08:27,955 --> 01:08:31,645
Speaker 6:  What is he, Antonio is very upset about the the airplane mode. He's like,

1150
01:08:31,645 --> 01:08:32,365
Speaker 6:  why is it here?

1151
01:08:33,435 --> 01:08:33,725
Speaker 4:  He's,

1152
01:08:33,725 --> 01:08:35,565
Speaker 6:  He's got a, he's got a bigger review coming up.

1153
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,365
Speaker 4:  Airplane's somewhat famous for having wifi now. Yeah, okay.

1154
01:08:38,795 --> 01:08:41,565
Speaker 6:  Some of them Delta very inconsistent.

1155
01:08:41,695 --> 01:08:44,445
Speaker 4:  Delta is switching from Go-go to ViaSat and it's not going well.

1156
01:08:44,955 --> 01:08:47,805
Speaker 6:  I'll put it out there. It's not. Yeah. But yeah, he, he, he likes, he likes

1157
01:08:47,805 --> 01:08:51,125
Speaker 6:  that it's very easy. He likes that. It just works. He likes that it's $200.

1158
01:08:51,305 --> 01:08:55,165
Speaker 6:  We both agree that if it's like one 50 it'd probably be in that like I wanna

1159
01:08:55,395 --> 01:08:59,165
Speaker 6:  play PlayStation in my bed. Yeah. This seems cool. And he says it's he, we

1160
01:08:59,165 --> 01:09:03,085
Speaker 6:  both used Chiaki, which is a, another kind of way to stream this stuff

1161
01:09:03,085 --> 01:09:06,045
Speaker 6:  usually to the steam deck. We both tried that, we liked it, but it's really

1162
01:09:06,135 --> 01:09:10,085
Speaker 6:  buggy and this is way less buggy than that. But it is also $200 and

1163
01:09:10,365 --> 01:09:14,245
Speaker 6:  does exactly one thing, which is play your PlayStation five games

1164
01:09:14,945 --> 01:09:18,405
Speaker 6:  in your house over wifi on this thing. This

1165
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:22,285
Speaker 5:  Is like a slight overstatement because I can't think of a lesser way

1166
01:09:22,285 --> 01:09:25,885
Speaker 5:  of putting this, but this is like a very polished turd of a device. Yeah,

1167
01:09:26,435 --> 01:09:27,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. No, I,

1168
01:09:27,405 --> 01:09:30,685
Speaker 6:  I think that's fair. Antonio and I were having a conversation about

1169
01:09:31,225 --> 01:09:34,925
Speaker 6:  why this exists because that's the big question is why,

1170
01:09:35,025 --> 01:09:38,685
Speaker 6:  and we, we think it's probably like started as probably a much more

1171
01:09:38,685 --> 01:09:42,325
Speaker 6:  ambitious project that slowly got paired down into this

1172
01:09:42,715 --> 01:09:45,165
Speaker 6:  because like you would think this would just be good for cloud gaming.

1173
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:48,925
Speaker 4:  The airplane mode is like real evidence that someone thought cloud gaming

1174
01:09:48,925 --> 01:09:50,205
Speaker 4:  would be a thing. Yeah. Yeah.

1175
01:09:50,445 --> 01:09:50,845
Speaker 6:  I think that's right.

1176
01:09:50,965 --> 01:09:54,325
Speaker 4:  I suspect this probably someone got drunk at a five G cloud

1177
01:09:54,325 --> 01:09:57,685
Speaker 4:  conference, right. and they were like, we should do a PlayStation Portal.

1178
01:09:58,065 --> 01:10:00,405
Speaker 4:  And then they're like, this doesn't work.

1179
01:10:00,435 --> 01:10:03,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And then they realized, oh we need a stronger processor if we're gonna

1180
01:10:03,435 --> 01:10:07,325
Speaker 6:  basically put a web browser on this little screen so we can play all the

1181
01:10:07,325 --> 01:10:08,325
Speaker 6:  games and not play safe games. I'm not

1182
01:10:08,325 --> 01:10:09,845
Speaker 4:  Approving this until they do banana surgery

1183
01:10:10,905 --> 01:10:14,765
Speaker 6:  And they're not gonna do it on this sky. But you know, if, if all

1184
01:10:14,765 --> 01:10:18,645
Speaker 6:  you wanna do is play PlayStation not on your PlayStation but in

1185
01:10:18,645 --> 01:10:22,165
Speaker 6:  your house, it's really cool. But probably don't need to buy it until it's

1186
01:10:22,165 --> 01:10:26,005
Speaker 6:  a lot cheaper. Yeah. And it'll probably will go on fire sale at some point.

1187
01:10:26,345 --> 01:10:26,565
Speaker 6:  I'm

1188
01:10:26,615 --> 01:10:28,605
Speaker 4:  Super buying one of these when it goes on sale. Yeah.

1189
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:32,565
Speaker 5:  I just bought a backbone controller. They have the new one that just came

1190
01:10:32,565 --> 01:10:36,485
Speaker 5:  out with USBC. So It works on like most devices now. I just bought one. It

1191
01:10:36,485 --> 01:10:40,325
Speaker 5:  is so much better an idea than this for half the price.

1192
01:10:40,515 --> 01:10:44,365
Speaker 5:  Like not only will it play my games remotely because those things

1193
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:48,365
Speaker 5:  exist as apps. It does all the other things too. Like I I

1194
01:10:48,365 --> 01:10:52,045
Speaker 5:  think you're absolutely right that when PlayStation started building this,

1195
01:10:52,185 --> 01:10:56,125
Speaker 5:  it was going to be much more ambitious than it is now. And what's weird

1196
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:59,765
Speaker 5:  to me is that Sony, which loves an expensive gadget,

1197
01:11:00,265 --> 01:11:04,205
Speaker 5:  didn't just build the good thing and charge a lot of

1198
01:11:04,205 --> 01:11:04,765
Speaker 5:  money for it.

1199
01:11:05,205 --> 01:11:08,245
Speaker 6:  I I, I don't think they could have because then it would've been like, okay,

1200
01:11:08,245 --> 01:11:12,045
Speaker 6:  you can play all your cloud games and PlayStation makes most of

1201
01:11:12,065 --> 01:11:14,885
Speaker 6:  its money. Not from the PlayStation. Yeah. But from the games

1202
01:11:15,395 --> 01:11:19,245
Speaker 4:  Also. It just doesn't work that well. Like that cloud gaming is not

1203
01:11:19,605 --> 01:11:21,645
Speaker 4:  I a mobile product in a way that works well

1204
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:25,045
Speaker 6:  Online. I mean I feel like 10, 15 hours of the last of us too via Chiaki

1205
01:11:25,045 --> 01:11:27,005
Speaker 6:  mainly 'cause I was scared of zombies. But you were

1206
01:11:27,505 --> 01:11:27,925
Speaker 4:  At your house.

1207
01:11:27,995 --> 01:11:29,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I was still at my house.

1208
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:33,045
Speaker 4:  I'm saying when you leave the world with a mobile device, when you leave

1209
01:11:33,045 --> 01:11:34,805
Speaker 4:  the world, when you, when you're

1210
01:11:34,805 --> 01:11:35,165
Speaker 6:  In space.

1211
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:38,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm saying when you leave your house with a mobile device and

1212
01:11:38,925 --> 01:11:42,885
Speaker 4:  you're trying to stream the last of us too from your on

1213
01:11:42,925 --> 01:11:46,085
Speaker 4:  a five G connection from an underpowered handheld, it's not gonna happen.

1214
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:46,525
Speaker 4:  It's

1215
01:11:46,525 --> 01:11:50,365
Speaker 6:  It's a lot rougher experience. You can, you can still do it. And, and the

1216
01:11:50,485 --> 01:11:53,245
Speaker 6:  backbone's a great example. Like you can still do this stuff, but I've, I've

1217
01:11:53,245 --> 01:11:56,285
Speaker 6:  tried using the backbone and other ones for cloud gaming like remote and

1218
01:11:56,285 --> 01:11:59,525
Speaker 6:  I'm like, this is gonna be great nightmarish experience. And the minute someone

1219
01:11:59,575 --> 01:12:03,285
Speaker 6:  texts me, I'm like, okay, I gotta go look at the text and then it takes me

1220
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:07,165
Speaker 6:  to 45 minutes just to reconnect to the cloud gaming. And and I It's no good.

1221
01:12:07,165 --> 01:12:08,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's no good. It's no fun.

1222
01:12:08,795 --> 01:12:12,005
Speaker 4:  It's gonna happen one day. One day. Sony I think Sean Hollister has reported

1223
01:12:12,005 --> 01:12:15,365
Speaker 4:  this. Sony has like hires for a cloud gaming service. I, yeah. I think Microsoft

1224
01:12:15,365 --> 01:12:17,445
Speaker 4:  obviously thinks cloud gaming is the future. Well

1225
01:12:17,635 --> 01:12:21,085
Speaker 6:  Sony has cloud gaming and it's had, it was, it was the first player. Yeah.

1226
01:12:21,085 --> 01:12:24,885
Speaker 6:  Because it bought a big cloud gaming Geca Geca right. Years ago. And so it's

1227
01:12:24,905 --> 01:12:27,685
Speaker 6:  had all of this tech just sitting there and it's like, nah.

1228
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:31,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So Sony just doesn't want you to know that it has cloud gaming. It's

1229
01:12:31,325 --> 01:12:35,165
Speaker 5:  like, it's like all when all the cable companies were trying to like pretend

1230
01:12:35,165 --> 01:12:38,285
Speaker 5:  that streaming didn't exist. They're like, don't, don't, don't worry about

1231
01:12:38,285 --> 01:12:41,125
Speaker 5:  it. It's fine. Don't worry. Yeah. No one, no one caress about that. It's,

1232
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:41,845
Speaker 5:  it's not a big deal.

1233
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:44,285
Speaker 4:  Speaking of the five G Revolution

1234
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:45,205
Speaker 5:  Oh God.

1235
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:50,045
Speaker 4:  Which has obviously impacted every corner of our lives. Yeah.

1236
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:54,285
Speaker 4:  I was doing banana surgery in a self-driving car just today on

1237
01:12:54,505 --> 01:12:55,485
Speaker 4:  at T five G.

1238
01:12:56,145 --> 01:12:57,965
Speaker 6:  Was it like in a video game?

1239
01:12:59,275 --> 01:13:02,885
Speaker 4:  Well, while gaming don don't know that. Oh wow. So I have been saying for

1240
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:06,805
Speaker 4:  months and months and months. I can't think of five G

1241
01:13:06,805 --> 01:13:10,085
Speaker 4:  experiences meaningful to people outside of the Aris tour.

1242
01:13:10,705 --> 01:13:13,405
Speaker 4:  And this is where the story about whether or not they did remote surgery

1243
01:13:13,425 --> 01:13:16,485
Speaker 4:  on a banana came from, 'cause everyone sent me a video of

1244
01:13:17,255 --> 01:13:21,125
Speaker 4:  robot surgery on a banana. It's fake was not done over five G They did do

1245
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:25,045
Speaker 4:  the surgery on the banana, but the caption saying was over five

1246
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:29,005
Speaker 4:  G all none of that was real. Yeah. Great. So I reached out to at

1247
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:32,845
Speaker 4:  and t and said, can you gimme some data on the Eras tour just to gimme

1248
01:13:32,925 --> 01:13:36,525
Speaker 4:  a sense of scale. I'm, I've been saying this thing, right. Eras tour, they're

1249
01:13:36,525 --> 01:13:40,365
Speaker 4:  playing huge NFL stadiums anywhere between 15 and a hundred thousand

1250
01:13:40,365 --> 01:13:43,765
Speaker 4:  people in these stadiums across the world that she's playing in around 70.

1251
01:13:43,835 --> 01:13:47,365
Speaker 4:  Like Cowboy Stadium is like at T Stadium, 80,000 people.

1252
01:13:47,745 --> 01:13:51,685
Speaker 4:  So at t was like very kind to me. Which historically given our coverage

1253
01:13:51,685 --> 01:13:54,325
Speaker 4:  at tt, they do not have to, but they're very kind to me. and they sent me

1254
01:13:54,365 --> 01:13:57,645
Speaker 4:  a chart of data usage during the A tour. So this is just at

1255
01:13:57,885 --> 01:14:01,645
Speaker 4:  TI asked T-Mobile and Verizon less interested at and t is very

1256
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:04,325
Speaker 4:  excited this, and we went back and forth in a week. 'cause I kept asking

1257
01:14:04,325 --> 01:14:07,445
Speaker 4:  him for more and more numbers. Alex watched this all go down. I did like

1258
01:14:07,445 --> 01:14:10,405
Speaker 4:  sitting next to me in the office. Okay, these numbers are

1259
01:14:10,955 --> 01:14:14,725
Speaker 4:  bonkers. So at T Stadium, which is where the Cowboys play

1260
01:14:16,025 --> 01:14:18,565
Speaker 4:  the highest night of the Eras tour,

1261
01:14:19,465 --> 01:14:23,165
Speaker 4:  28.9 terabytes of data are flowing through at t's

1262
01:14:23,485 --> 01:14:27,005
Speaker 4:  wireless network. and they gave me the five g plus numbers, which in this

1263
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:30,885
Speaker 4:  case means millimeter wave at t has also branded mid band five

1264
01:14:31,005 --> 01:14:34,885
Speaker 4:  g plus. It's very confusing. But this is the big

1265
01:14:34,885 --> 01:14:37,805
Speaker 4:  stadium. 80,000 people, maybe a little bit less. 'cause you know, not every,

1266
01:14:37,905 --> 01:14:41,605
Speaker 4:  not all seats are full at the tour, but somewhere between 70, 80,000 people,

1267
01:14:42,065 --> 01:14:46,045
Speaker 4:  29 terabytes of data. At and t they're, they're rough

1268
01:14:46,295 --> 01:14:49,725
Speaker 4:  estimation is that every terabyte of data is either

1269
01:14:49,905 --> 01:14:53,725
Speaker 4:  200,000 photos or 400 hours of HD video.

1270
01:14:56,105 --> 01:15:00,045
Speaker 4:  So 29 terabytes of data are just like moving through

1271
01:15:00,045 --> 01:15:02,125
Speaker 4:  the stadium during the highest night. Is it all

1272
01:15:02,235 --> 01:15:02,525
Speaker 6:  Just

1273
01:15:02,525 --> 01:15:06,485
Speaker 4:  Parents that is just at and t That is not Verizon or

1274
01:15:06,605 --> 01:15:10,165
Speaker 4:  T-Mobile. This is a record, this is most data at and t is seen in any

1275
01:15:10,435 --> 01:15:12,605
Speaker 4:  stadium at all this year.

1276
01:15:12,995 --> 01:15:13,845
Speaker 6:  They confirmed it's a

1277
01:15:13,845 --> 01:15:15,765
Speaker 4:  Record. They confirmed that's the absolute record.

1278
01:15:15,905 --> 01:15:19,365
Speaker 5:  So that means I just did, I just did some very quick Googling here. And that

1279
01:15:19,365 --> 01:15:22,925
Speaker 5:  means that if every single person at that concert that night

1280
01:15:23,225 --> 01:15:27,165
Speaker 5:  was using at and t to do this, every single person

1281
01:15:27,425 --> 01:15:30,645
Speaker 5:  on average uploaded about 72 photos from that

1282
01:15:30,645 --> 01:15:34,045
Speaker 4:  Concert. That's crazy. Right. And I totally believe it. Yes.

1283
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:39,525
Speaker 5:  Every one of the 80,000 people there uploaded 72 photos while they were

1284
01:15:39,525 --> 01:15:39,925
Speaker 5:  at the concert.

1285
01:15:40,665 --> 01:15:41,085
Speaker 4:  That's

1286
01:15:41,105 --> 01:15:41,525
Speaker 5:  Insane.

1287
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:45,805
Speaker 4:  That's crazy. So that's at t And And at t Stadium is like a city,

1288
01:15:46,095 --> 01:15:49,965
Speaker 4:  right? This is a full day total. But you know, you can be

1289
01:15:49,965 --> 01:15:52,805
Speaker 4:  there for hours and hours before and after. There's like lots of, so it's

1290
01:15:52,805 --> 01:15:56,605
Speaker 4:  a big stadium. It's a complex, but the Cowboys

1291
01:15:56,605 --> 01:15:59,925
Speaker 4:  play there. So just by comparison, the average

1292
01:16:00,235 --> 01:16:04,085
Speaker 4:  Cowboys game is 21 terabytes. So she's just blown away a

1293
01:16:04,085 --> 01:16:05,085
Speaker 4:  cowboys game. She's a

1294
01:16:05,085 --> 01:16:07,045
Speaker 6:  29. They're just focused on, they're focused on the sport.

1295
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:07,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

1296
01:16:07,725 --> 01:16:09,605
Speaker 6:  They're they're focused on the sport, not the singing.

1297
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:13,445
Speaker 4:  So, and then you just go down list Nissan Stadium, 23 Terabytes n RRG Stadium

1298
01:16:13,465 --> 01:16:16,885
Speaker 4:  in Houston. Taylor lost to the rodeo. Yeah.

1299
01:16:17,465 --> 01:16:20,965
Speaker 4:  So the rodeo moved. 24 terabytes of data.

1300
01:16:21,585 --> 01:16:23,485
Speaker 4:  Swifty has only moved 20.2. Look,

1301
01:16:23,715 --> 01:16:27,485
Speaker 6:  Bull riding is an impressive sport and sometimes you wanna upload

1302
01:16:27,685 --> 01:16:29,565
Speaker 6:  a hundred million photos of it.

1303
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:33,645
Speaker 4:  At and t Stadium also outdid the Super Bowl in 2022 at SoFi Stadium,

1304
01:16:33,695 --> 01:16:37,005
Speaker 4:  which was 13 terabytes. The 23 Super Bowl

1305
01:16:37,705 --> 01:16:41,445
Speaker 4:  at State Farms Stadium in Arizona was 21 terabytes.

1306
01:16:41,585 --> 01:16:45,525
Speaker 4:  So Taylor is just like way above all the next highest numbers basically.

1307
01:16:46,465 --> 01:16:50,325
Speaker 4:  And my favorite one all the way down here is US Bank Stadium,

1308
01:16:50,325 --> 01:16:54,245
Speaker 4:  Minneapolis, where the Vikings play, it was 6.6

1309
01:16:54,245 --> 01:16:57,805
Speaker 4:  terabytes of data. But at and t point at speed. That's 6.6 terabytes of data.

1310
01:16:58,275 --> 01:17:01,445
Speaker 4:  70% more data than is ever used during a Vikings game.

1311
01:17:02,195 --> 01:17:06,085
Speaker 4:  Like every other event is at least 70% less than the Taylor Swift concert.

1312
01:17:06,805 --> 01:17:09,765
Speaker 4:  I can't, I couldn't resist that one. I think they knew I'm a backers fan

1313
01:17:10,275 --> 01:17:12,605
Speaker 4:  when they're like, like these fans aren't even trying,

1314
01:17:12,765 --> 01:17:15,725
Speaker 5:  I don't know man. Lambo Field didn't even make the list here. So I don't.

1315
01:17:15,785 --> 01:17:16,005
Speaker 5:  She

1316
01:17:16,005 --> 01:17:19,845
Speaker 4:  Saw she didn't play on Lambo Field. Yeah. Anyway, it's, these are crazy

1317
01:17:19,845 --> 01:17:23,245
Speaker 4:  numbers. We got the whole chart on the site. It was cool to ask the question.

1318
01:17:23,245 --> 01:17:26,965
Speaker 4:  It was cool to get all the data back. I do not know why five G plus is both

1319
01:17:27,205 --> 01:17:30,445
Speaker 4:  millimeter wave and mid band. We should fix that. Someone should fix that.

1320
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:34,605
Speaker 4:  But these numbers are stagger like just a

1321
01:17:35,065 --> 01:17:38,965
Speaker 4:  absurd amount of data. And it is because of five G, like I talk

1322
01:17:38,965 --> 01:17:42,725
Speaker 4:  a lot of crap about five G and at t and Verizon and

1323
01:17:42,885 --> 01:17:46,245
Speaker 4:  T-Mobile like everyone else, So, I feel about these things. But the fact

1324
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:49,805
Speaker 4:  that they have actually built out the stadiums to support

1325
01:17:49,955 --> 01:17:53,325
Speaker 4:  this amount of video and photo sharing in real time.

1326
01:17:53,915 --> 01:17:57,725
Speaker 4:  Like I watched night one in Argentina. I just

1327
01:17:57,725 --> 01:18:01,045
Speaker 4:  watched it on TikTok from like five different angles. Did

1328
01:18:01,045 --> 01:18:03,005
Speaker 5:  You see when she hugged Travis Kelsey? It was incredible.

1329
01:18:03,205 --> 01:18:05,685
Speaker 4:  I did not, why didn't not watch that part. I was just like, I was like, you

1330
01:18:05,685 --> 01:18:08,365
Speaker 4:  know I was like scrolling. I was like, oh I'm just watching the Eras tour.

1331
01:18:08,865 --> 01:18:12,725
Speaker 4:  Huh? That's just happening. And it's because we have actually built out the

1332
01:18:12,725 --> 01:18:16,205
Speaker 4:  network capacity to do these things, which is remarkable

1333
01:18:17,085 --> 01:18:19,285
Speaker 4:  regardless of what I've, all the stuff around it. The thing

1334
01:18:19,285 --> 01:18:22,565
Speaker 5:  That always gets me, this is a complete aside, but the thing that always

1335
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:25,925
Speaker 5:  gets me about those videos now is that how good phone microphones have gotten.

1336
01:18:25,995 --> 01:18:28,925
Speaker 5:  Like, do you remember not that long ago that you would, you would watch one

1337
01:18:28,925 --> 01:18:32,085
Speaker 5:  of these streams and it would just sound like garbage. They sound great

1338
01:18:32,225 --> 01:18:36,005
Speaker 4:  Now. No. So here's the thing that is happening. The swifties have learned

1339
01:18:36,115 --> 01:18:39,765
Speaker 4:  that you need to turn noise canceling off on your iPhone mics.

1340
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:44,205
Speaker 4:  So they all were trying to wonder, they're all trying to figure it out. Why

1341
01:18:44,225 --> 01:18:46,885
Speaker 5:  Wasn't it, weren't they all using Galaxy phones for a minute? 'cause they

1342
01:18:46,885 --> 01:18:47,565
Speaker 5:  sounded better or

1343
01:18:47,565 --> 01:18:51,525
Speaker 4:  Something. There's an incredible arms race in like camera technology

1344
01:18:51,615 --> 01:18:55,005
Speaker 4:  among Swifties to the point where people are taking, you're not allowed to

1345
01:18:55,005 --> 01:18:58,925
Speaker 4:  bring an SLR. So they've just sort of maxed out the sort of fixed

1346
01:18:58,955 --> 01:19:02,405
Speaker 4:  lens mirrorless camera you can bring there. and they are shooting videos

1347
01:19:02,585 --> 01:19:06,365
Speaker 4:  by bringing fixed lens mirrorless cameras that can

1348
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:10,325
Speaker 4:  shoot 24 full like full

1349
01:19:10,325 --> 01:19:12,005
Speaker 4:  frame pictures a second. Are there

1350
01:19:12,005 --> 01:19:12,605
Speaker 6:  Like 21

1351
01:19:12,605 --> 01:19:14,125
Speaker 4:  Year olds and just running the shutters. 20

1352
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:17,525
Speaker 6:  Year olds just like decked out and Swifty Eras to her

1353
01:19:17,955 --> 01:19:19,725
Speaker 6:  swag laptop on knees.

1354
01:19:20,265 --> 01:19:22,965
Speaker 4:  You can't bring a laptop. How? How do they offer, if you could bring a laptop

1355
01:19:22,965 --> 01:19:25,445
Speaker 4:  to the Air store, I would've brought a laptop to the Air store. Who am I

1356
01:19:25,795 --> 01:19:27,165
Speaker 4:  last week? I'm out here with decks

1357
01:19:27,665 --> 01:19:31,005
Speaker 6:  Trying to record it. Flipping around so you get that face scam.

1358
01:19:32,315 --> 01:19:35,845
Speaker 4:  It's horrible. I brought a studio display. It's got an M one chip in it.

1359
01:19:36,545 --> 01:19:40,245
Speaker 5:  Do you think next year or like the Pixel nine will have a thing where it

1360
01:19:40,245 --> 01:19:43,725
Speaker 5:  just like automatically makes whatever video you take of Taylor Swift like

1361
01:19:43,755 --> 01:19:47,285
Speaker 5:  look like the best performance Taylor Swift ever did? Yes. It's just like,

1362
01:19:47,355 --> 01:19:50,085
Speaker 5:  it's like the moon photos you just pointed at Taylor Swift and it just makes

1363
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,005
Speaker 5:  Taylor Swift look amazing.

1364
01:19:51,825 --> 01:19:52,245
Speaker 4:  The Rock

1365
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:53,285
Speaker 6:  Will also be in it. The

1366
01:19:53,285 --> 01:19:54,325
Speaker 5:  Rock is just sort of over

1367
01:19:54,325 --> 01:19:57,125
Speaker 4:  There. And YouTube is like, don don't know who has a record deal here. I'm

1368
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,525
Speaker 4:  out. We can't. She's gonna rerecord 'em all. Anyway,

1369
01:20:01,285 --> 01:20:04,925
Speaker 4:  I just wanna note some other little stories before I break. Alex pointed

1370
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:08,285
Speaker 4:  out the first OLED Roku TV is here, but it's made by Sharp. Mm.

1371
01:20:08,785 --> 01:20:10,005
Speaker 4:  Yep. That's all you need to say there.

1372
01:20:10,245 --> 01:20:11,125
Speaker 6:  Probably an LG panel though.

1373
01:20:11,175 --> 01:20:13,845
Speaker 5:  Don't buy a Roku tv. They suck. That's

1374
01:20:13,845 --> 01:20:16,645
Speaker 6:  What I was telling my dad yesterday. He called me three times to ask about

1375
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:17,045
Speaker 6:  it. No.

1376
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:20,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah, we had a review of the Fitbit charge six, which people

1377
01:20:20,885 --> 01:20:24,005
Speaker 4:  really miss Fitness bands. We got one of those. The interesting

1378
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:29,605
Speaker 4:  Sonos having a weird quarter. They're having a weird time lately. They're

1379
01:20:29,605 --> 01:20:33,365
Speaker 4:  teasing big new products. It seems very likely that those are

1380
01:20:33,365 --> 01:20:34,285
Speaker 4:  headphones. Yeah,

1381
01:20:34,285 --> 01:20:37,165
Speaker 5:  This is my other lightning round thing. It's gotta be headphones, right?

1382
01:20:37,635 --> 01:20:40,085
Speaker 4:  It's gotta be headphones or they're gonna make a tv. I think that's the only,

1383
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,645
Speaker 4:  that's the next logical place for them

1384
01:20:42,065 --> 01:20:43,765
Speaker 6:  Tv. 'cause I don't want Sonos headphones.

1385
01:20:44,405 --> 01:20:47,205
Speaker 4:  Everyone should make a tv. Apple should make a tv. Sonos should make a tv.

1386
01:20:47,265 --> 01:20:48,325
Speaker 6:  The Verge is gonna make a tv.

1387
01:20:48,725 --> 01:20:51,125
Speaker 4:  I would you make a kick ass tv. It'd

1388
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,005
Speaker 6:  Be so good. It would be 40,000.

1389
01:20:53,185 --> 01:20:56,925
Speaker 4:  And then I need, yeah, our volume would not be high.

1390
01:20:57,145 --> 01:20:59,845
Speaker 6:  All the stuff we put at it, we'd be like, this is the best tv. Yeah,

1391
01:20:59,845 --> 01:21:02,405
Speaker 4:  You can't no motion smoothing available whatsoever. Yeah. And then David,

1392
01:21:02,645 --> 01:21:06,125
Speaker 4:  I need you to talk about the Opal Tadpole because merely

1393
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:09,885
Speaker 4:  mentioning the Opal C one to people makes them so, so angry.

1394
01:21:10,185 --> 01:21:12,285
Speaker 5:  It caused so many feelings. I

1395
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:15,045
Speaker 4:  Bought one for our CEO and it's the biggest mistake I've ever made my entire

1396
01:21:15,045 --> 01:21:15,885
Speaker 4:  career. You

1397
01:21:15,885 --> 01:21:16,525
Speaker 6:  Still have a job though.

1398
01:21:16,865 --> 01:21:18,125
Speaker 4:  It was dicey. I

1399
01:21:18,325 --> 01:21:21,885
Speaker 5:  I debated including that in the story and ultimately didn't. Yeah, so

1400
01:21:22,165 --> 01:21:26,005
Speaker 5:  Opal 2021 launched a webcam called the C

1401
01:21:26,025 --> 01:21:29,565
Speaker 5:  one that they were like, this is the first DSLR quality webcam.

1402
01:21:30,345 --> 01:21:34,245
Speaker 5:  It looked good, but you would never know because there was like a 75%

1403
01:21:34,245 --> 01:21:37,005
Speaker 5:  chance it wouldn't work with your computer. And at a given time, I think

1404
01:21:37,295 --> 01:21:41,285
Speaker 5:  we've all tried to use them at various times. We all gave up. Mine's

1405
01:21:41,285 --> 01:21:45,245
Speaker 5:  just over there in a cabinet somewhere. Looks great, never works. And this

1406
01:21:45,245 --> 01:21:48,325
Speaker 5:  time they came out with a thing called the Tadpole, which is this cute little

1407
01:21:48,465 --> 01:21:52,245
Speaker 5:  one inch by one inch square. I have it here for anyone watching on YouTube.

1408
01:21:52,595 --> 01:21:56,245
Speaker 5:  It's adorable. It's an iPod shuffle. Like if, if you are listening to this

1409
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:59,965
Speaker 5:  in your car, it's an iPod shuffle with a cable coming out of it.

1410
01:22:00,385 --> 01:22:04,245
Speaker 5:  and they basically tried to solve everything about the last

1411
01:22:04,265 --> 01:22:07,885
Speaker 5:  one. It works better. You don't need dumb software, you just plug it in and

1412
01:22:07,885 --> 01:22:11,285
Speaker 5:  it like works. It's very funny to me that this was like a big idea that they

1413
01:22:11,285 --> 01:22:14,045
Speaker 5:  had was like, what if you just plugged it in and it was good, but they, they

1414
01:22:14,045 --> 01:22:16,325
Speaker 5:  got a lot of things right. It's still pretty expensive. It's like, I think

1415
01:22:16,325 --> 01:22:20,085
Speaker 5:  that's $175. But the rage

1416
01:22:20,085 --> 01:22:24,045
Speaker 5:  that this brought up in the comments on our site from a lot of people who

1417
01:22:24,545 --> 01:22:27,845
Speaker 5:  bought the C one or were excited about it or were on the wait list or whatever

1418
01:22:28,065 --> 01:22:31,205
Speaker 5:  and feel like they've just been left behind as Opal has gone on to this other

1419
01:22:31,205 --> 01:22:34,685
Speaker 5:  product was really interesting. And I spent some time with the founders.

1420
01:22:35,475 --> 01:22:39,445
Speaker 5:  They know they have a hole to dig out of and that they didn't

1421
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:43,045
Speaker 5:  do everything right the first time and made some mistakes and move too fast

1422
01:22:43,045 --> 01:22:46,885
Speaker 5:  and all this stuff. But their reputation is in worse

1423
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:49,805
Speaker 5:  shape than I expected, which I thought was really interesting. Yeah, like

1424
01:22:49,805 --> 01:22:52,925
Speaker 5:  this is a good webcam. I've been using it a bunch. I I have enjoyed it so

1425
01:22:52,925 --> 01:22:56,085
Speaker 5:  far, but every time I say that to somebody they're like, it's impossible.

1426
01:22:56,385 --> 01:22:57,725
Speaker 5:  The C one was a piece of junk.

1427
01:22:58,065 --> 01:23:01,565
Speaker 6:  The OAL C one is so bad that our producer was like, you have to stop using

1428
01:23:01,565 --> 01:23:02,765
Speaker 6:  it. And sent me a new webcam.

1429
01:23:02,795 --> 01:23:04,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. He bought us new webcams so that we'd stop

1430
01:23:04,725 --> 01:23:05,765
Speaker 4:  Using it. Thank you Liam.

1431
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:08,965
Speaker 6:  It constantly overheats and would just shut down. Or sometimes it would just

1432
01:23:08,965 --> 01:23:12,765
Speaker 6:  be like, not today. Alex, you don't need, no one needs to see your face and

1433
01:23:12,765 --> 01:23:15,325
Speaker 6:  like, I should make that decision, not my webcam.

1434
01:23:15,515 --> 01:23:16,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Hello.

1435
01:23:19,105 --> 01:23:20,205
Speaker 6:  No, it's true sometimes like

1436
01:23:20,345 --> 01:23:22,765
Speaker 4:  The AI is like, eh, it's like, ooh, not today kid

1437
01:23:23,115 --> 01:23:25,845
Speaker 6:  Alex. No, you stayed up too late last night.

1438
01:23:26,065 --> 01:23:29,685
Speaker 4:  Shh. All. right? We got end this. It's like very, very dangerous. Every time

1439
01:23:29,685 --> 01:23:32,885
Speaker 4:  we talk about the Opal, I fear for my job in like five different ways. Here's

1440
