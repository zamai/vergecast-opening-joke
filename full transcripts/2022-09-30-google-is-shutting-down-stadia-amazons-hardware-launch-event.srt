00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,390
Speaker 5:  imagine we're like the local radio station we just like broadcast from the

Speaker 5:  Alex.

9
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,600
Speaker 6:  Hi. I'm still upset about Google Wave. It could have been a thing.

10
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,590
Speaker 5:  It could have. I wholeheartedly grew with that. I also don't remember which

11
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,870
Speaker 5:  one is Google Wave and which one is Google Buzz? Don't ask me to tell the

12
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,630
Speaker 5:  difference. I couldn't

13
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,380
Speaker 7:  Tell you. Google Wave was, it was the better one.

14
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,580
Speaker 5:  Okay, that's good to know. That's j Peters. J Peters is here. Hi Jay.

15
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,630
Speaker 7:  I am Google Wave.

16
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,270
Speaker 6:  Jay is the

17
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,070
Speaker 5:  Wave you work like half the time, but you seem cool. Is that, is that

18
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,670
Speaker 5:  basically the fine?

19
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,330
Speaker 7:  That's accurate. Yeah, that's what I lost that, but yeah,

20
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,950
Speaker 5:  Eli is not here. Excuse he made was that he has like

21
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,550
Speaker 5:  45 weddings to go to this weekend. So if you have tips on how to be a good

22
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,190
Speaker 5:  wedding guest, please send them all to Eli. He's at Reckless on Twitter and

23
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,430
Speaker 5:  I'm sure he would love to hear all of your wedding tips. We have a lot to

24
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,310
Speaker 5:  talk about, but we definitely need to start with the big breaking news of

25
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,720
Speaker 5:  today. Just a couple hours before we started recording this, Google Stadia

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,710
Speaker 5:  is dead. Yeah. Jay, you, you found out about this like 10

27
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,890
Speaker 5:  minutes before it was happening. Tell us what's going on.

28
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,700
Speaker 7:  Yep. So Google is shutting down Stadia.

29
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,180
Speaker 7:  It's cloud gaming service. It'll stay

30
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,870
Speaker 7:  online for folks who subscribe or play games on it until

31
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,590
Speaker 7:  January 18th of next year. The good news is if you've

32
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,900
Speaker 7:  invested into hardware or software on Stadia,

33
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,790
Speaker 7:  Google's gonna refund everything to you. But if you loved Google Stadia

34
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,630
Speaker 7:  because of the dream of cloud gaming, Stadia will not be part of

35
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,030
Speaker 7:  that dream anymore, unfortunately. So

36
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,960
Speaker 5:  Wait, every penny that anyone ever spent on Google Stadia, Google is giving

37
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,620
Speaker 5:  back.

38
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,280
Speaker 7:  Not quite. Okay. If you subscribed to its Stadia Pro

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,270
Speaker 7:  subscription, they're not gonna refund those. But if you

40
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,010
Speaker 7:  were subscribed, you can still use Stadia Pro

41
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,660
Speaker 7:  through until the shutdown happens.

42
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,560
Speaker 5:  Got it. What are like incredible admission of not only

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,480
Speaker 5:  failure, but like we are sorry we conned all of you into thinking this

44
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,800
Speaker 5:  was a thing we were actually doing. Yeah. That they're just giving all your

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,200
Speaker 5:  money back.

46
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,760
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it's not, you know, I mean, I'm happy that people get their money back

47
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,480
Speaker 7:  cuz I think a lot of people, well maybe not a lot, but a fair

48
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,360
Speaker 7:  amount of people, people really, really believed in what this could

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,240
Speaker 7:  do. And you know, it very pie in the sky sounds awesome, right? You can

50
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,520
Speaker 7:  stream your games onto whatever platform, whatever screen you're in front

51
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,720
Speaker 7:  of. But for Google, that's not reality. I

52
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,160
Speaker 6:  I think it's, cuz it was always a beta, It was, it was always a beta that

53
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,120
Speaker 6:  they just charged for.

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,080
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I mean, it it it launched super rocky and without a bunch of the

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,360
Speaker 7:  really cool features that they announced right at the start. And, you know,

56
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,000
Speaker 7:  they slowly added some of those things, but like, it wasn't enough. And,

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,200
Speaker 7:  and when you have to think about like, is my internet connection gonna even

58
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,440
Speaker 7:  work to play this game? Like, I think that's enough of a barrier for people

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,550
Speaker 7:  that it, it just can't catch on.

60
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,160
Speaker 5:  I was talking about this with Tom on Wednesday show that like, there is just

61
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,080
Speaker 5:  this invisible barrier for people that it's like internet gaming is

62
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,880
Speaker 5:  a good idea. It's probably definitely the future and it is just not

63
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,000
Speaker 5:  something people are ready for. And the thing that really amazed me was going

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,670
Speaker 5:  back and reading some of the stuff from the launch in 2019, like

65
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,480
Speaker 5:  this service was never very good, was the thing that I forgot.

66
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,400
Speaker 5:  It was like a cool idea. And there were some people who were like, Yeah,

67
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,040
Speaker 5:  this could really turn into something. But even at the very beginning it

68
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,590
Speaker 5:  was like, there is some big important stuff missing here,

69
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,400
Speaker 5:  namely, like, there aren't really very many good games to play. That

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,040
Speaker 5:  wasn't true. That's like if we have learned one thing, it's like just have

71
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,960
Speaker 5:  good games.

72
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,860
Speaker 6:  There were good games, they had good games. The problem was were there,

73
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,410
Speaker 6:  The internet in the United States is

74
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,320
Speaker 6:  garbage. Yes. Like it's bad. Everybody has

75
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,680
Speaker 6:  bad internet. Very few people have good internet. We are currently

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,160
Speaker 6:  recording this podcast and all of our videos are super

77
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,800
Speaker 6:  pixelated. Yep. Because the internet is so bad it can't handle

78
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,440
Speaker 6:  video streams. So of course I wasn't gonna be able to handle stadia. And

79
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,360
Speaker 6:  like I remember talking to the heads of Stadia when it came out and

80
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Speaker 6:  I was like, What are you gonna do about this? And they're like, Well, you

81
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,320
Speaker 6:  know, ISPs recognize when things are bad and they improve them. And I was

82
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,900
Speaker 6:  like, that's just, are you dumb?

83
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,480
Speaker 7:  But Alex,

84
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,120
Speaker 6:  Like they were, they were like, No, it'll happen. And I was like, but it

85
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,800
Speaker 6:  didn't, it wasn't gonna happen. Alex, how are you gonna make that happen?

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,350
Speaker 7:  Well, 5G was the obvious answer for that one. Of course.

87
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,050
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. Everybody's like, 5G gonna be

88
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,000
Speaker 6:  5G and cloud gaming together hand in hand will transform the

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,600
Speaker 6:  world. And it's like they won't because you still have to get

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,240
Speaker 6:  fast internet 5g.

91
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,280
Speaker 5:  You say that like, it's a joke by the way. But that really is what they said,

92
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,200
Speaker 5:  like that really genuinely is what they said. You did

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,120
Speaker 6:  Say that they were like, this is gonna save the world. You're gonna be able

94
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,070
Speaker 6:  to like cloud game doing laparoscopic surgery on

95
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,640
Speaker 6:  your best friend's dying mother with

96
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,130
Speaker 6:  Stadia. They didn't say that part, but these were all these huge,

97
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,120
Speaker 6:  massive promises and they kept forgetting the fact that at

98
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,480
Speaker 6:  the end of the day, you still have to have pipes that pipe the internet to,

99
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,180
Speaker 6:  to the 5G broadcast towers and to the people's homes.

100
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,470
Speaker 6:  And nobody wants to pay for those.

101
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I think,

102
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,350
Speaker 6:  Sorry, I get very passionate about internet infrastructure.

103
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,550
Speaker 7:  I mean, it's important, It's important for a technology

104
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,280
Speaker 7:  that requires good infrastructure to make the

105
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,690
Speaker 7:  games work. So I think you're really justified

106
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,600
Speaker 7:  in being passionate about this one.

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,560
Speaker 5:  Well, and I think yeah, if you're, if you do the business in a

108
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,200
Speaker 5:  very different way, I think you can maybe get away with it. Like I, I

109
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,080
Speaker 5:  have PS4 down in my basement and I use

110
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,040
Speaker 5:  the PS4 remote play to play video games on a computer and

111
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,320
Speaker 5:  it's like, it's kind of what you're describing. It's like occasionally blocky,

112
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,300
Speaker 5:  there's a little lag, but it's a free thing that just sort of exists.

113
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,400
Speaker 5:  And so anything about it that like works at all

114
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,240
Speaker 5:  feels like a victory. And I will take that. Google came out

115
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,360
Speaker 5:  and said, not only are you gonna pay for the games that you want, you're

116
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,720
Speaker 5:  gonna pay for the privilege of streaming the games that you want. And at

117
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,480
Speaker 5:  the beginning they were making people buy that like weird, expensive package

118
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,600
Speaker 5:  that also included a Chromecast and it's just like they set it up as this

119
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,400
Speaker 5:  very premium, very like high intensity future

120
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,520
Speaker 5:  of gaming thing and you know who's gonna buy that as people who need way

121
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,780
Speaker 5:  more out of their games than Google Stadium is gonna give them.

122
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,310
Speaker 6:  Yes, a hundred percent.

123
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,160
Speaker 7:  I really like Microsoft's approach personally where it feels like

124
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,900
Speaker 7:  cloud gaming is like an add on to

125
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,760
Speaker 7:  the things you can already, you know, you can buy game from the store and

126
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,760
Speaker 7:  just play out your Xbox and that's fine, but if you want to test one, you

127
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,450
Speaker 7:  can test that using the cloud. I think that's a really perfect application

128
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,300
Speaker 7:  of cloud gaming technology with the internet infrastructure

129
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,780
Speaker 7:  for the vast majority of Americans right now.

130
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,560
Speaker 6:  And I think it's like notable that Microsoft

131
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,160
Speaker 6:  and Nvidia are the two that are still like really in

132
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,040
Speaker 6:  this. Amazon's out there doing Luna, I'm sure it's gonna get

133
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,760
Speaker 6:  canceled next week. They're gonna be like, Oh, oh, we're canceling these

134
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,660
Speaker 6:  now. Yeah, we're out of this game too. But you know, Microsoft

135
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,480
Speaker 6:  and Nvidia both have been doing this for a lot longer. Microsoft

136
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,080
Speaker 6:  has been doing this for since I think at least in

137
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,560
Speaker 6:  2019, right? Was when they first launched their beta. I

138
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,120
Speaker 7:  Think. I think that sounds right. NVIDIA's

139
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,030
Speaker 6:  Invidia's been doing it even longer and, and doing a free

140
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,680
Speaker 6:  beta don't charge you any money. They only started charging very recently

141
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,280
Speaker 6:  when everybody else started ing before that. They're like, Yeah, this is

142
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,830
Speaker 6:  cool technology, but we know it's not worth your money yet.

143
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,680
Speaker 5:  I've been wondering about Invidia actually, and I'm, I'm curious what you

144
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,520
Speaker 5:  both think because like the, the state of GForce now is exactly

145
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,880
Speaker 5:  what you just described and I think Invidia got away with it because Invidia

146
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,480
Speaker 5:  was just selling all the Bitcoin mining rigs that

147
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,200
Speaker 5:  existed in the universe and I was

148
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,100
Speaker 6:  Doing it before Bitcoin,

149
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,840
Speaker 5:  But like the, the GPU business has been so good for so long that like

150
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,200
Speaker 5:  Invidia could kind of get away with this. Right? And now like what's clearly

151
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,360
Speaker 5:  happening here is all of these companies are going through and saying, okay,

152
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,200
Speaker 5:  where are our money pits where we can go and actually like the,

153
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Speaker 5:  the economy is not great. We're like potentially headed to a recession. Everybody's

154
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,120
Speaker 5:  doing hiring freezes. It's like if I'm Google, it's pretty easy to look at

155
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,880
Speaker 5:  this and say, Okay, we're paying a fortune for games because we set it up

156
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,720
Speaker 5:  in this weird way where you have to like build an extra version of your game

157
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,280
Speaker 5:  just to run on Stadia. We have all this cloud infrastructure

158
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,240
Speaker 5:  that's really expensive and no one is signing up for our services.

159
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,080
Speaker 5:  So like obviously we should kill this thing. And I wonder if there are going

160
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,140
Speaker 5:  to be a bunch of other companies who make that same kind of

161
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,190
Speaker 5:  calculation.

162
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,080
Speaker 6:  I don't think Invidia and Microsoft will be those companies. Okay.

163
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,320
Speaker 6:  Microsoft, because it's j like rightfully pointed out, it's treated very

164
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,240
Speaker 6:  much like an add-on. This is like a nice bonus perk. And they've got the

165
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,880
Speaker 6:  infrastructure in place, right? Like they're one of the largest cloud computing

166
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,520
Speaker 6:  companies in the world. Invidia also really big cloud computing company.

167
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,040
Speaker 6:  Like they've had these servers for a long time and they've been doing this

168
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,860
Speaker 6:  for a long while and it's, it's a different thing for them,

169
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,760
Speaker 6:  but they've actually, like, it's an actually good service. I

170
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,710
Speaker 6:  can go play. I've been, I've played civilizations six on

171
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,568
Speaker 6:  Nvidia GForce now since like 20 17, 20 18.

172
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:24,360
Speaker 6:  Been doing it for ages and like Yeah. Is it pixelated?

173
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,160
Speaker 6:  Is it Bucky? Sometimes Sure. Is there one time where like it just wouldn't

174
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,440
Speaker 6:  quit the game and I would like go away and I'd come back and my game was

175
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,260
Speaker 6:  still running like four hours later even though I'd left the browser.

176
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,070
Speaker 6:  Yes.

177
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,070
Speaker 5:  This is not a compelling case that you think its

178
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,030
Speaker 6:  It's great. I love it.

179
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,960
Speaker 7:  I mean I, I think it's nice purely is an option. Like when I

180
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,730
Speaker 7:  was visiting family one time, I played through all of Donut County

181
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,680
Speaker 7:  on my phone using Xbox Club gaming and that was like, oh, this is a fun

182
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,040
Speaker 7:  game about a hole that just gets bigger and bigger and eats up all the stuff.

183
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,920
Speaker 7:  But like if I was really into Destiny, I don't know

184
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,720
Speaker 7:  if I would invest, you know, tons of time into Destiny on

185
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,240
Speaker 7:  Stadia where you have to shoot good, right? Like, and I don't know if I can

186
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,140
Speaker 7:  do that. I don't know if I can do that on Stadia or other cloud platforms.

187
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,800
Speaker 7:  You can't.

188
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,760
Speaker 5:  So what happens to all this stuff now? Like there's all the

189
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,720
Speaker 5:  infrastructure, there's people, the strangest thing I've been noticing is

190
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,160
Speaker 5:  there are a million people who are really curious about the controller. I've

191
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,000
Speaker 5:  never actually used this Stadia controller, but people seem to really like

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
Speaker 5:  it. What's, how, what's happening here? I

193
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,880
Speaker 7:  Haven't used the controller either. It looks like a good deep, you know,

194
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,480
Speaker 7:  a good controller. Like it looks fine. Like it's

195
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,290
Speaker 7:  nice.

196
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,350
Speaker 6:  It, it lets you play the games.

197
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,840
Speaker 5:  People are psyched about it. They're like, Okay, you can shut down Stadia.

198
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,560
Speaker 5:  I don't need my games, but like this deep ad y'all like I need, I need

199
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,600
Speaker 5:  the deep A Well

200
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,680
Speaker 7:  What I think what I was, what I've been reading and I haven't dug into this

201
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,520
Speaker 7:  myself, you know, all the way, but I think like you can't connect it to

202
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,680
Speaker 7:  your be a Bluetooth to your computer or whatever. You can plug it in with

203
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,600
Speaker 7:  a wire, but like way more controllers, you know, probably

204
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,120
Speaker 7:  everybody has a couple just sitting in a drawer somewhere can connect to

205
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,600
Speaker 7:  a computer. Another thing with Bluetooth. And so like, I think there's a

206
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,030
Speaker 7:  good chance that people just stop using these controllers.

207
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,240
Speaker 6:  Well, the, they like the, the controller doesn't serve a purpose after this

208
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,720
Speaker 6:  because the controller was built to connect directly to

209
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,600
Speaker 6:  Stadia. It didn't like connect to your Chrome's. Yeah. And then go through

210
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,100
Speaker 6:  it connected straight to the cloud. It's got its own wifi

211
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,390
Speaker 6:  and I'm sure somebody will get out there and hack it. Please,

212
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,040
Speaker 6:  please hit me up on Twitter. If you're that person and you successfully do

213
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,590
Speaker 6:  it, I wanna talk to you. Yeah. But for most people

214
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,520
Speaker 6:  it's, it's now just a piece of plastic that is gonna go into a

215
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,790
Speaker 6:  landfill and be bad for the environment.

216
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,760
Speaker 5:  Google made so many weird decisions here. Yeah. The like, I forgot that the

217
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,720
Speaker 5:  controller was connected to the internet. Like it just, Google tried way

218
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,040
Speaker 5:  too hard here. I think because

219
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,800
Speaker 6:  They wanted to avoid the

220
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,310
Speaker 7:  Lab. I wanted to avoid the

221
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,790
Speaker 5:  Google thing.

222
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,680
Speaker 7:  I mean, I think, I think the real death now happened more than a

223
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,370
Speaker 7:  year ago when it shuttered its internal game studios. Like

224
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,320
Speaker 7:  if you are trying to make cloud gaming a thing and you're not

225
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,240
Speaker 7:  gonna keep your own game studios for, let's assume they're

226
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,000
Speaker 7:  in production for two years. Like most AAA games take at least

227
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,840
Speaker 7:  three years to make, like that was a pretty

228
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,270
Speaker 7:  clear sign that they were not in this for the long haul.

229
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,110
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I have been wondering why Google didn't just shut this down

230
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,160
Speaker 5:  a year ago, Like in a certain way it would've been cleaner. And then everybody

231
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,880
Speaker 5:  has been resurfacing these like vociferous denials that Google

232
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,840
Speaker 5:  is shutting it down and it all, it's so brutal now because everyone

233
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,160
Speaker 5:  of them is like, we're in this for the long haul. Like we know you think

234
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,600
Speaker 5:  Google kills lots of products, but we'll never kill Stadia. It

235
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,360
Speaker 7:  Was like two months ago too. Like Yeah. Yeah.

236
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,610
Speaker 7:  It's, it's not a great situation.

237
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,440
Speaker 5:  No. And it, it causes it like all the things everybody already thinks about

238
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,600
Speaker 5:  Google products, this just makes even worse. But to your point about the

239
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,560
Speaker 5:  games, I do think the one thing that makes me think like Luna might still

240
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,520
Speaker 5:  live is that Amazon potentially against all

241
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,140
Speaker 5:  odds and rational thinking is very invested in making video games

242
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,120
Speaker 5:  and seems to have just continued to try spending money on making

243
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,800
Speaker 5:  video games that people will play. I don't know if it's ever gonna work,

244
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,400
Speaker 5:  but it seems to be trying. Yeah,

245
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,240
Speaker 7:  I think the gap we still need to see them cross is like them to

246
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,200
Speaker 7:  take New World, which is this fairly popular mmo, I

247
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,720
Speaker 7:  don't remember how big it is now, but like I don't think you can play that

248
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,480
Speaker 7:  on Luna yet. Right. I think the the big when that, that will all

249
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,440
Speaker 7:  come together when Amazon makes these big ambitious live service

250
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,000
Speaker 7:  games and then you can just play in with your Luna subscription,

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,890
Speaker 7:  Right? I think that's when that will all happen. But will it happen

252
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,030
Speaker 7:  is the real big question mark.

253
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,830
Speaker 6:  I don't think it's gonna happen. Like I just, I fundamentally do not think

254
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,720
Speaker 6:  Luna is going to survive. It's, it's got, here is my, my my

255
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,680
Speaker 6:  my litmus test for a cloud gaming platform and whether or

256
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,520
Speaker 6:  not it's got legs go on Reddit, look up the subreddit for the

257
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,440
Speaker 6:  cloud gaming platform. And how many followers does it have? Stadia has

258
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,620
Speaker 6:  over a hundred thousand.

259
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,300
Speaker 7:  How many does Luna have?

260
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,250
Speaker 6:  Let's see.

261
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,980
Speaker 7:  Reddit, Luna. Oh

262
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,620
Speaker 5:  Man. Can I just say the, the the mood in the Stadia

263
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,260
Speaker 5:  subreddit is so bleak right now.

264
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,910
Speaker 5:  Like it's really just the, the top comment

265
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,720
Speaker 5:  on like, the main thing saying it's shutting down just says sad,

266
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,620
Speaker 5:  but probably the best possible way to shut the service down. It's like,

267
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,340
Speaker 5:  they're not even mad. They're just like, Oh, what a, this thing had like

268
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,750
Speaker 5:  a beautiful life and now it's over and let's just

269
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,410
Speaker 7:  Warning my money back.

270
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,640
Speaker 5:  I guess that's so bleak.

271
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,840
Speaker 7:  But

272
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,760
Speaker 6:  But to the point of like who's actually using these services? Stadia

273
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,540
Speaker 6:  had over, you know, dedicated cloud gaming service, over a

274
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,180
Speaker 6:  hundred thousand followers on subreddit, on the subreddit, Luna Cloud

275
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,660
Speaker 6:  gaming, just like kind of the main subreddit for Amazon Luna.

276
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,860
Speaker 6:  2000,

277
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,180
Speaker 7:  2,700 is a big difference. Sorry.

278
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,100
Speaker 6:  Sorry. Big

279
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,490
Speaker 7:  Difference.

280
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,330
Speaker 6:  Huge difference.

281
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,620
Speaker 7:  Like, yeah,

282
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,500
Speaker 6:  This thing is, this thing is, is not gonna survive. And

283
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,380
Speaker 6:  you look at like the, the, the games are all games that have been out for

284
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,490
Speaker 6:  three or four years. It's like, come on,

285
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,420
Speaker 5:  I should stop reading this Stadia subreddit. Sorry.

286
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,700
Speaker 5:  Somebody's very mad that Stadi is being shut down. And the biggest reason

287
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,940
Speaker 5:  that they're mad is because today is the same day that Hot Wheels Unleash

288
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,340
Speaker 5:  was released. And I was looking forward to playing that on

289
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,980
Speaker 7:  Stadia. Oh man, that's brutal.

290
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,780
Speaker 5:  R i p Hot Wheels unleash. So

291
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,820
Speaker 7:  Sad. Tough,

292
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,100
Speaker 5:  Tough.

293
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,570
Speaker 6:  It's notable though, Jay, how are you feeling about the fact that

294
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,350
Speaker 6:  Stadia, the Stadia subreddit scooped you on,

295
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,540
Speaker 6:  on Stadia being shut

296
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,250
Speaker 7:  Down? You know, I'm glad for them, honestly. They were watching so close.

297
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,200
Speaker 7:  This is, this is their Friday Joy. They love it. Like

298
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,060
Speaker 7:  I'm glad that they, I'm glad they were able to come to terms with

299
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,250
Speaker 7:  this a little bit sooner than everybody else was.

300
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,670
Speaker 6:  They noticed 15 minutes before it was official

301
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,350
Speaker 6:  because they were all, somebody went on the store

302
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,340
Speaker 6:  to buy a Stadia game, presumably. And there was just a sign saying,

303
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,340
Speaker 6:  this is closing in January, 2023. And they were

304
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,540
Speaker 6:  like, Is this real? And there's like a whole flurry of it and then it's like

305
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,130
Speaker 6:  Jay's story and they're like, Yep, it's, it's real.

306
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,060
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it's real. I think what is, it doesn't seem

307
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,780
Speaker 7:  like Google told hardly anybody, like it sounds like

308
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,700
Speaker 7:  Bungee, which makes Destiny. They, they're learned at

309
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,620
Speaker 7:  the same time pretty much how everybody else did. I feel like I've read a

310
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,420
Speaker 7:  couple of developers on Twitter who were not aware of this and

311
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,230
Speaker 7:  so, you know, Lian

312
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,370
Speaker 6:  Studios,

313
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,290
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Like Stadia will be going away, but

314
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,130
Speaker 7:  this creates some collateral damage that developers have to deal with, which

315
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,300
Speaker 7:  kind of sucks for them, especially since they had no warning that this is

316
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,690
Speaker 7:  what they'd be waking up to.

317
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,920
Speaker 6:  I am really curious about, so Larry's Studios does

318
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,840
Speaker 6:  big RPGs. They, they have the new one coming out. Boulders

319
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,680
Speaker 6:  Gate, three people bought the game on Stadia cuz it was like

320
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,550
Speaker 6:  one of the first games announced for Stadia and it was gonna have this really

321
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,520
Speaker 6:  cool exclusive to Stadia feature where it's like, it's Dungeons and

322
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,390
Speaker 6:  Dragons, but a video game. And so you were gonna be able to roll dice,

323
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,120
Speaker 6:  well like streaming it directly to YouTube via Stadia

324
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,360
Speaker 6:  and people could roll the dice for you, like viewers could. And it was gonna

325
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,630
Speaker 6:  be like, okay, that's cool. That's neat.

326
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,340
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

327
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,120
Speaker 6:  All gone just all dead and you go and like

328
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,320
Speaker 6:  Larry Studio has made no comment, they have not talked about this.

329
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,160
Speaker 6:  Boulder's Gate is still not out of beta. It's

330
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,000
Speaker 6:  still not

331
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,920
Speaker 7:  Ly Yeah. I mean they have to pivot so fast. Although is

332
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,750
Speaker 7:  that game coming to other systems? It must be. Yeah.

333
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's totally coming. So it's coming to a lot of systems. But there

334
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,940
Speaker 6:  was like, a big thing was, well we're not being exclusive to Stadia,

335
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,230
Speaker 6:  but we are giving Stadia exclusive

336
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,960
Speaker 6:  features like this dice rolling

337
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,720
Speaker 6:  mechanism that's that's really cool. And oh, you

338
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,420
Speaker 6:  just wasted three years.

339
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,080
Speaker 5:  You can only assume that they're, say as they're saying that Phil Harrison

340
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,920
Speaker 5:  is like standing behind them just like hucking a hundred dollars bills at

341
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,800
Speaker 5:  them, right? Like no, no one in their right mind is making a

342
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,680
Speaker 5:  stu a Stadia exclusive or even like a stadia optimized game without

343
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,720
Speaker 5:  Google. And I think

344
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
Speaker 6:  There were Stadia exclusive. There

345
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,880
Speaker 7:  Are, there's very few of them I think like yeah they were, they were there

346
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,780
Speaker 7:  but there were not many of them

347
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,880
Speaker 5:  And you're not doing it unless Google really, really, really makes it worth

348
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,440
Speaker 5:  for awhile. Which is, I think part of has been part of Google's problem is

349
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,080
Speaker 5:  like, it's kind of like meta with the quest, right? Like at some point yeah

350
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,840
Speaker 5:  it just becomes so expensive to fund this thing unless other

351
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,680
Speaker 5:  people buy in and meta seems to so far have the

352
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,240
Speaker 5:  stomach to keep funding vr, but Google seems to have just run out with

353
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,310
Speaker 5:  Stadia.

354
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,040
Speaker 6:  I think it was the same thing we see time and time again with new game

355
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,800
Speaker 6:  consoles where you have to have a lot of established relationships

356
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,560
Speaker 6:  with developers. Yeah. And that was besides the

357
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,080
Speaker 6:  internet problem, the big problem for Stadi was they don't have those

358
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,640
Speaker 6:  relationships Invidia and Microsoft do. That's been their success.

359
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,360
Speaker 6:  Amazon bought those relationships by buying studios and

360
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,080
Speaker 6:  and building their own studios. Stadia was always just like, anybody

361
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,530
Speaker 6:  wanna put a game on a, on a service?

362
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,610
Speaker 7:  We got this great class service.

363
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,860
Speaker 7:  Do

364
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,680
Speaker 6:  You wanna come on over to Stadia

365
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,110
Speaker 7:  Town? It streams from the internet. Everybody did. Yeah.

366
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,960
Speaker 6:  Well excuse me, a hundred thousand people in the Stadia subreddit maybe

367
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,200
Speaker 6:  did

368
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,000
Speaker 5:  10,200 of them are online. This is like, this is, this is the

369
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,880
Speaker 5:  most interesting Stadia has ever been in its history, including to Stadia

370
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,840
Speaker 5:  fans. It's very sad the whole this, I cannot

371
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,040
Speaker 5:  get over this subreddit. Everybody is just like, they've gone through the

372
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,970
Speaker 5:  five stages of grief so fast and they're just moving on to like, you know,

373
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,960
Speaker 5:  we had a good run and now Stadia is in a better place and that place is like

374
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,710
Speaker 5:  the landfill along with my controller and it's, it's just, it's just bleak.

375
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,440
Speaker 5:  Game Pass is the big winner here, right? Like this game pass now

376
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,200
Speaker 5:  becomes the, if you want cloud gaming Game Pass is is like

377
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,280
Speaker 5:  the default answer and it kind of was already right, but like this is now

378
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,160
Speaker 5:  even clearer than before.

379
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,850
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it

380
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,410
Speaker 6:  Invidia

381
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,800
Speaker 7:  Invidia too, but I, I mean like for the average

382
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,680
Speaker 7:  consumer to just jump into cloud

383
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,250
Speaker 7:  gaming in any way, shape or form, doing it through Xbox Game Pass

384
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,080
Speaker 7:  is probably the way most people can and

385
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,990
Speaker 7:  may want to do it.

386
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,240
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like I just always liked it as this

387
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,110
Speaker 6:  nice extra, the other people we're not talking about is Sony.

388
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,720
Speaker 6:  Sony does in fact kind of have cloud gaming,

389
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,280
Speaker 7:  Right? Yeah. I mean you can get it

390
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,120
Speaker 6:  Technically

391
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,680
Speaker 7:  You can get it through their PlayStation press. I think it's the

392
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,260
Speaker 7:  ultra, ultra premium tier offers cloud gaming,

393
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,190
Speaker 7:  but like

394
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,440
Speaker 6:  That like $400 a month you to buy a PS five

395
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,610
Speaker 7:  Every month. Yeah. And that's before you can get the VR

396
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,520
Speaker 7:  headset. What I'm curious is what this all

397
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,400
Speaker 7:  means in five to 10 years. Because I feel like there was a big rush of cloud

398
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,880
Speaker 7:  gaming stuff in like the early 2010s and then it went away for a little bit.

399
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,840
Speaker 7:  Yep. And we had this rush a few years ago and this could

400
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,680
Speaker 7:  be the dip of that next next movement and it's like, are we gonna

401
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,350
Speaker 7:  see this again in 10 more years? Like, I don't know.

402
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. My guess would be it's, it seems unlikely that it's gonna go all the

403
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,090
Speaker 5:  way away again just because Microsoft in particular

404
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,880
Speaker 5:  is just so in on this being the long term future

405
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,400
Speaker 5:  with Azure and Xbox and it's like, it is the perfect confluence of

406
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,510
Speaker 5:  everything Microsoft wants to do. Sony

407
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,390
Speaker 7:  Relies on Azure for its cloud gaming. So like

408
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:29,350
Speaker 7:  you're right that that Microsoft stands to gain quite a bit,

409
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,710
Speaker 7:  especially now that Stadia is going away.

410
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Is Google trying to make this a Google cloud thing? They're trying

411
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,230
Speaker 5:  to like, they've been like white labeling it for folks, right?

412
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,040
Speaker 7:  They have been white labeling it and the blog today they kind of talked about

413
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,000
Speaker 7:  how the technology in Stadia will be utilized in

414
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,760
Speaker 7:  other ways that parts of the company. I mean, I don't

415
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,750
Speaker 7:  think that's gonna mean like at and t can buy

416
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,550
Speaker 7:  Stadia on Google Cloud or whatever. Like

417
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,360
Speaker 7:  I doubt that that's, I I, this to me feels like a big retreat

418
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,590
Speaker 7:  from cloud gaming.

419
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That definitely means like you can connect the controller to your

420
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,870
Speaker 5:  phone and use it to play. Right? Yeah.

421
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,760
Speaker 5:  Sudoku. Like that's, that's what that means. Like I don't, no one's, I

422
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,440
Speaker 5:  don't know. I would not be on anything else. Yeah. Well

423
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,280
Speaker 6:  I was always curious, did they own, like we know AMD

424
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,800
Speaker 6:  worked with them on the servers they used, Were those servers just always

425
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,160
Speaker 6:  just Google servers that they repurposed to do Stadia Or were those

426
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,510
Speaker 6:  like specific built for Stadia servers?

427
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,480
Speaker 7:  I don't know. I mean you have to imagine that at least the plan was

428
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,320
Speaker 7:  to have built for Stadia servers, but like, I'm not

429
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,950
Speaker 7:  sure about that.

430
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,200
Speaker 5:  Google has talked a lot about the infrastructure behind it. Yeah. And the

431
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,680
Speaker 5:  amount of work that it did. And I would assume in the same way that

432
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,480
Speaker 5:  like building data centers serves gaming, it

433
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,040
Speaker 5:  also serves other things, right? So there's probably a version of stuff that

434
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,120
Speaker 5:  they would've had to build and they're gonna build both the hardware and

435
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,040
Speaker 5:  the software slightly differently to do games than to like run Gmail. But

436
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,270
Speaker 5:  I can't imagine very much of that stuff is just gonna be like

437
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,000
Speaker 5:  mothballed because they're not doing gaming anymore.

438
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,280
Speaker 6:  They're just gonna like switch Google Docs over to it now. Google Docs is

439
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,450
Speaker 6:  just gonna like, Google Doc is gonna be

440
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,320
Speaker 5:  So fast. It's gonna

441
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,710
Speaker 6:  Be incredible.

442
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,560
Speaker 7:  Google Meet is gonna look great you guys. It's gonna be so

443
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,430
Speaker 7:  good. Yeah.

444
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,920
Speaker 5:  This

445
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,090
Speaker 6:  Is how they get Google meet. This is how, this is how it comes.

446
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,440
Speaker 5:  Do your video chat in a Hot Wheels car. Why didn't,

447
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,240
Speaker 7:  Why didn't they put games in Google Meet? This is why Stadia failed. You

448
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,990
Speaker 7:  guys like this is, this is it. We figured it out. Yeah,

449
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,600
Speaker 5:  I think we fixed it. Yeah. Yeah. This is great.

450
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,400
Speaker 7:  Well they have, they got three months to turn that around

451
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,240
Speaker 7:  and unannounced that, you know, Oh, Stadia is coming back as your favorite

452
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
Speaker 7:  new meat feature

453
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,990
Speaker 5:  And we're now renaming it. There's gonna be Meat, Meat Original and Meet

454
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,880
Speaker 5:  Stadia. There's gonna be Three Meat. It's gonna be amazing. You're gonna

455
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,400
Speaker 5:  love it. It'll

456
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,040
Speaker 6:  Be, Cause it'll be like the Destiny Edition will be the Hot Wheels

457
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,910
Speaker 6:  edition. No, the Boulder Skate edition.

458
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,400
Speaker 7:  It's gonna be great. I'll track this idea. I don't want it

459
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,020
Speaker 7:  anymore.

460
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,440
Speaker 5:  The absolute best part of that is you just described Mark Zuckerberg's vision

461
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,440
Speaker 5:  for the Metaverse. Like I just, I just want you to know that is, that is

462
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,680
Speaker 5:  what he wants. Yeah.

463
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,320
Speaker 6:  Maybe, maybe he's the one. He's gonna be like those servers. What you doing

464
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,790
Speaker 6:  with them? I got some ideas. Get in on this. Mata

465
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,420
Speaker 7:  Meda has their big Quest event soon.

466
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,990
Speaker 7:  You know, big announcement.

467
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,600
Speaker 6:  That's

468
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,720
Speaker 5:  True. That's, yeah, that's in two weeks. We

469
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,460
Speaker 6:  Bought Stadium

470
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,760
Speaker 5:  The amazing Phil Harrison works for

471
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,720
Speaker 7:  Me now. I mean he's, he's, he's worked at Sony and then it was

472
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,470
Speaker 7:  Microsoft and then it was Google. So meta seems like a logical

473
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,900
Speaker 7:  next jump if he, you know, if he wants to work at all the companies,

474
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,800
Speaker 6:  Not Amazon.

475
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,680
Speaker 5:  It's gotta be web three next. It's

476
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,840
Speaker 7:  Gotta I hope not. Oh boy, I

477
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,160
Speaker 5:  Hope not. He's gonna go like run Axi Infinity and, and everything's gonna

478
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,120
Speaker 5:  be insane.

479
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,410
Speaker 7:  Good luck to him. I wish him all the best.

480
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,600
Speaker 5:  We should quickly talk about the other Google News of the week. They had

481
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,240
Speaker 5:  their big search on event this week. Jay, you and I both

482
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,000
Speaker 5:  wrote some stuff you wrote about multi search, which I actually think is

483
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,880
Speaker 5:  like the most interesting new Google product when

484
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,240
Speaker 5:  it comes to search stuff. What, what was new this week? What

485
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,080
Speaker 7:  Happened? So multi search is this pretty cool technology

486
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,000
Speaker 7:  where on your phone you can hold up through the Google app.

487
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,360
Speaker 7:  You use Google Lens to take a photo of something and then you can add

488
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,320
Speaker 7:  text to that photo search. So it's like

489
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,040
Speaker 7:  pointing at a jacket that you like and saying, what if it was in

490
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,960
Speaker 7:  green? And Google will show you a jacket like that that is in

491
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,550
Speaker 7:  green. And so it, it, it's a really neat way, I think to

492
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:36,120
Speaker 7:  search a little bit differently in ways that just writing out a query in

493
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,080
Speaker 7:  text doesn't let you do that. It's currently available globally in

494
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,560
Speaker 7:  English and it will be expanding to more than 70 different

495
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,210
Speaker 7:  languages in the coming months is, which is what Google announced.

496
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,070
Speaker 6:  Is it gonna understand that I'm very into

497
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:54,960
Speaker 6:  brands and like I want my designer labels Or is it

498
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,950
Speaker 6:  gonna be like, you can go buy this $2 knockoff at

499
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,710
Speaker 6:  h and m?

500
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,370
Speaker 7:  I don't know that I, I tested it by pointing it

501
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,640
Speaker 7:  at my AirPods Pro case and then I typed

502
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,560
Speaker 7:  green black is what I think I did just to like really see what it would

503
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,280
Speaker 7:  throw up. And it showed me like greenish air, original

504
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,240
Speaker 7:  AirPods case. So like it was okay close. It wasn't perfect, but like, it

505
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,040
Speaker 7:  was definitely like in the right direction of what I was intending.

506
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,910
Speaker 7:  And and of course Google's gonna invest a whole lot into this,

507
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,800
Speaker 7:  unlike other products that we've recently talked about. And so I

508
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,910
Speaker 7:  think you'll get better over time.

509
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,960
Speaker 5:  Alex, I'm just imagining all of your searches where you just like take a

510
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,080
Speaker 5:  picture of somebody's clothes and then you type but make it fashion. Yeah,

511
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,680
Speaker 5:  and that's, that's just, that's that's the Alex Grands way. What's

512
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,990
Speaker 6:  The expensive version?

513
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,710
Speaker 5:  This times 10.

514
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,680
Speaker 7:  Have I not tested

515
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,110
Speaker 5:  That one? But at zero

516
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,380
Speaker 7:  I need the Gucci version. Yeah.

517
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,320
Speaker 5:  And Jay, you did forget one part of the step, which is that then Google will

518
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,080
Speaker 5:  send you to Google shopping and say, please, dear God, do not buy this on

519
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,640
Speaker 5:  Amazon.

520
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,640
Speaker 7:  That's right. Yeah. I forgot that step.

521
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah, they, they'll they'll beg you to do that. Do they,

522
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,190
Speaker 6:  Do they like blacklist Amazon results?

523
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,540
Speaker 7:  I don't think they're legally allowed to do that

524
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,280
Speaker 5:  But, But can they shove them so far down the page below a bunch of

525
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,320
Speaker 5:  Google shopping results that you never even see them? Yes they can. And they

526
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,440
Speaker 5:  And they will. I bet

527
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,240
Speaker 7:  They will.

528
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,840
Speaker 5:  Alright, we should take a break. We're gonna come back and talk about

529
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,160
Speaker 5:  Amazon because the tech news just keeps coming. Jay, thanks for hanging out.

530
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,880
Speaker 5:  Thanks for having me. We will be right

531
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,630
Speaker 5:  back

532
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,160
Speaker 5:  We're back. Jay's gone. Jen two is here. Hi Jen.

533
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,110
Speaker 5:  Hi. You're in Texas, is this correct? I

534
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,190
Speaker 5:  am

535
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,920
Speaker 10:  In, yes. I'm in Dallas, Texas right now. Having a great

536
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,880
Speaker 10:  time at the CIA trade show, which is the custom integrator,

537
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,040
Speaker 10:  smart home, audio, visual, all that kind of fun stuff.

538
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,320
Speaker 5:  Alex, how aggressive is your fomo right now?

539
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,620
Speaker 6:  It's, it's super aggressive because

540
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,060
Speaker 10:  She was tweeting me places to go and eat while I'm here.

541
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,980
Speaker 6:  She was like, I can't get to any of those. I was like, they only serve cheese

542
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,920
Speaker 6:  and beans and beef. That's it. Do you want healthy

543
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,450
Speaker 6:  food? You're not getting it in Dallas. But yeah,

544
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,280
Speaker 6:  no, I love the show though too. Like Dallas obviously sucks

545
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,240
Speaker 6:  because I'm from Fort Worth and we always call it Dallas because they call

546
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,000
Speaker 6:  us Fort Worth. I like that. And it's big rivalry. So I'm

547
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,360
Speaker 6:  sorry you're in the worst of the two towns of the

548
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,040
Speaker 6:  metroplex. There's more than two towns, but I'm sorry you're in the worst

549
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,680
Speaker 6:  one. But CIA is cool. Like CIA is a, is a show

550
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,030
Speaker 6:  I actually really enjoy because it is all of these custom

551
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,520
Speaker 6:  installers doing all this really weird cool shit. And then

552
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,200
Speaker 6:  like LGS there, Samsung's there. It sounds like Amazon is

553
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,600
Speaker 6:  there showing off arrow stuff. Like there's a lot happening

554
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,630
Speaker 6:  there.

555
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,840
Speaker 10:  Yeah, it's big Google's here. Google's actually sponsored the whole

556
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,740
Speaker 10:  thing. Oh wow. So yeah. Yeah, Google

557
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,560
Speaker 10:  Pro. I guess they're calling it, you know, it's everyone's here.

558
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,040
Speaker 10:  It's a big show but it's a little show like it has, it feels comfortable

559
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,190
Speaker 10:  and small. It's not scary and huge like ces.

560
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,080
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's

561
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,920
Speaker 10:  Intimate. I've been enjoying it.

562
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,000
Speaker 6:  It's an intimate show.

563
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,750
Speaker 10:  Yes. Very intimate. Next time you'll have to come with me.

564
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,600
Speaker 6:  I know we, we'll go together and then we will drive out to Fort Worth to

565
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,390
Speaker 6:  go to get real good food. It's not in Dallas.

566
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:19,160
Speaker 5:  I just, I'm really hung up on the fact that Fart Worth is a much funnier

567
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,770
Speaker 5:  joke than Dallas.

568
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,460
Speaker 10:  In Dallas

569
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,120
Speaker 5:  And I just, it's like Fort Worth is just very

570
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,960
Speaker 6:  Good. That's something DAAs person would say.

571
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,760
Speaker 10:  Everybody

572
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,470
Speaker 6:  Knows Fort Worth is superior. We have culture. What does Dallas have?

573
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,600
Speaker 6:  They got cdf. That's it. And they only is cd. I think they only get like

574
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,200
Speaker 10:  This year. That's true. Yeah. Yeah, it does not here every year. So

575
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,820
Speaker 10:  we'll have to wait until it comes around again. Well, we'll go together.

576
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,200
Speaker 10:  But there's a lot of cool stuff. The show floor is exciting and there's,

577
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,560
Speaker 10:  it's packed, There's a lot of people here. This is the first big in person

578
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,480
Speaker 10:  show that we've had for a long time, so everyone's excited. There's

579
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,910
Speaker 10:  a, there's a real good vibe here and lots of

580
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,880
Speaker 10:  loud, loud sounds everywhere. Yeah. Everyone playing

581
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,660
Speaker 10:  their speakers as loud as possible. Oh boy. Lots of music

582
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,000
Speaker 10:  And it's, It's a party. It's a party here. Sure.

583
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,640
Speaker 6:  Oh my God, I love it. Well we, we had, we wanted to talk to you today

584
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,040
Speaker 6:  because in addition to being at CIA seeing a lot of the stuff that's happening

585
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,950
Speaker 6:  at the show, Amazon also had this massive event this week and

586
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,830
Speaker 6:  I feel like you were blogging all week to cover this event.

587
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,680
Speaker 6:  A lot of stuff happened. Kinda kinda walk me through

588
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,080
Speaker 6:  some of the, walk us through some of the stuff that happened,

589
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,040
Speaker 10:  Right? Yeah. So big event. Not actually as

590
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,840
Speaker 10:  big as Amazon has done in the past. We've sometimes

591
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,680
Speaker 10:  had, you know, 72 product announcements in five minutes

592
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,480
Speaker 10:  but they still managed to cra cram a lot in and

593
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,070
Speaker 10:  press for David Li's diction at that speed. He does well. Yeah,

594
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:51,880
Speaker 10:  Very impressed. But yeah, well the most important, most exciting thing

595
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,320
Speaker 10:  I'm sure, and I can't believe you haven't mentioned this yet, if you've

596
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,400
Speaker 10:  been on the Vergecast for like more than two seconds, is that Kindle now

597
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,120
Speaker 10:  comes with a stylist.

598
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,320
Speaker 5:  We've been waiting as long as we could. I'm very proud of Alex for making

599
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,840
Speaker 5:  it this long and I think at this point we have waited long enough that

600
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,240
Speaker 5:  Alex, we, we've reserved three hours for you to just talk about the

601
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,190
Speaker 5:  Kindle.

602
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,040
Speaker 6:  I know there's a very special episode. I was like emergency

603
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,680
Speaker 6:  meeting. We need a four hour verge cast just so I can talk about

604
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,480
Speaker 6:  this. Yeah, no the Kindle was definitely, I think

605
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,160
Speaker 6:  for me the most exciting thing that came out of this because this is their

606
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,120
Speaker 6:  10.2 inch, 300 PPI Kindle that

607
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,830
Speaker 6:  you can also write on. It is not the first product that's

608
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,150
Speaker 6:  a 10 inch writing ink

609
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:40,120
Speaker 6:  tablet, not buy a long shot. Remarkable. Obviously has

610
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,840
Speaker 6:  done two of these already and we're waiting for a third. Books is out

611
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,640
Speaker 6:  there, Big mes out there. We've got a lot of

612
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,090
Speaker 6:  companies doing this. But this is Amazon and Amazon is like the biggest,

613
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:54,960
Speaker 6:  biggest e ink producer in the United States. Like they're the only ones

614
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,800
Speaker 6:  really doing it at the scale. Cobo is way, way, way behind them. They sell

615
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,680
Speaker 6:  the most e-readers in America. So this is a huge, huge

616
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,520
Speaker 6:  deal because like they're kind of the defacto e-reader in the

617
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:10,650
Speaker 6:  United States, which means this is now the defacto e ink

618
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,390
Speaker 6:  writing tablet thing in the US Maybe I worry.

619
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:17,760
Speaker 10:  Well and they were showing off little, you know, how you could use it to

620
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,370
Speaker 10:  sort of annotate while you're reading stories to your children

621
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:25,320
Speaker 10:  or add notes when you are doing your research. I mean I can see a

622
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,590
Speaker 10:  lot of use cases for this. I mean it's expensive though.

623
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:32,440
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's, it's actually, it's interesting because the prices,

624
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,960
Speaker 6:  it's kind of right between the remarkable and, and my personal favorite of

625
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,720
Speaker 6:  these devices, which is the really log of obnoxious name. I'm so

626
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,400
Speaker 6:  sorry. The Onyx books spelled with an

627
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,140
Speaker 6:  X. Yeah. Nova Air

628
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,630
Speaker 6:  two catchy.

629
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Rolls right off the tongue. That one. Yeah. Hold

630
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,880
Speaker 6:  On. You didn't let me finish. Oh my God. Plus which is,

631
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,710
Speaker 6:  which is another 10.3 inch another, you know, 10 plus

632
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,400
Speaker 6:  inch device, Same weight pretty much as, as the new

633
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,320
Speaker 6:  Amazon one, same size, same form with

634
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,840
Speaker 6:  the, with the, the handle on the side, all of the same

635
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,720
Speaker 6:  stuff. But it has Android on it. So I can also do

636
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,520
Speaker 6:  like Barn and Noble Nook or the Cobo e-Reader or Libby.

637
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,300
Speaker 6:  Right. This is very explicitly for writing

638
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,030
Speaker 6:  and reading in Amazon's ecosystem.

639
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,600
Speaker 10:  Yeah, yeah. Which is a large ecosystem but definitely

640
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,500
Speaker 10:  limits the wider appeal

641
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,360
Speaker 6:  For, and I think for some people, for myself I try to, I've been trying to

642
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,280
Speaker 6:  like cut back on the stuff I used in Amazon cause I'm like eh, how

643
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,260
Speaker 6:  great things are ethically sometimes.

644
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,120
Speaker 5:  But you're like amped about using a tablet from a company no

645
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,050
Speaker 5:  one has ever heard of

646
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,280
Speaker 6:  In China that

647
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,840
Speaker 5:  Where

648
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,120
Speaker 6:  I have to like do weird hats.

649
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,410
Speaker 5:  Yeah, right. Of mysterious

650
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:54,350
Speaker 6:  To like activate the place store. I am not

651
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:58,120
Speaker 6:  consistent in my, my moral code.

652
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,120
Speaker 6:  Let's, let's be clear on that.

653
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,670
Speaker 10:  That's

654
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:04,530
Speaker 6:  Famous. Amazon ran it with Android. I'd probably be like buy five.

655
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,920
Speaker 5:  My, my big theory about this is it is going to be like a, just a

656
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,610
Speaker 5:  monster slam dunk. Huge success a hundred percent instantly. Like

657
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:15,520
Speaker 5:  if it's good and we've only seen demos and stuff, but

658
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,960
Speaker 5:  like the, the closest thing I got to a demo is I was on a call with one of

659
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,400
Speaker 5:  the execs on the Kindle team and he held his up to the

660
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,320
Speaker 5:  webcam and wrote Hi David on it and it looked really good. Oh. But that

661
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,040
Speaker 5:  is the extent of which, like that's the only in the wild. That's

662
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,280
Speaker 10:  All you

663
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,800
Speaker 5:  Saw Kindle scribe I've actually seen. But if this thing is good, it's gonna

664
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,680
Speaker 5:  be a gigantic success because it's like, it's the kind of thing a

665
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,040
Speaker 5:  lot of people want, especially like business people, which I thought was

666
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,640
Speaker 5:  really interesting. Like they make, they're making a big pitch for this is

667
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,520
Speaker 5:  like, it's a way to take meeting notes. You can have to-do lists on it.

668
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,480
Speaker 5:  It's like a thing to bring into the room with you for business meetings,

669
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,320
Speaker 5:  which is like classic Amazon way of thinking about things. But I think

670
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,160
Speaker 5:  it's, if it's, if it's not bad, I think it's gonna be a huge

671
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,390
Speaker 5:  hit and it might be bad.

672
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,310
Speaker 6:  I, I like, I think it's, I think it will absolutely be a hit one because

673
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:08,160
Speaker 6:  it's, it's the first really big e-reader that, that Amazon's done

674
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,880
Speaker 6:  since what the dx They haven't had a big one. Yeah, it's like a decade. And

675
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,720
Speaker 6:  people love that thing. People want a big e-reader. Like that's,

676
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,760
Speaker 6:  that's a, that's a common complaint is why are they so small? I want like

677
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,160
Speaker 6:  a big screen so I can look at it from this far so I don't have to put on

678
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,760
Speaker 6:  reading glasses or anything like that. I can just read it. And so one,

679
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,560
Speaker 6:  it's really big and two it can write and if they can get the writing down,

680
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,400
Speaker 6:  but that's hard to do. It took remarkable long, long time to do it and a

681
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,160
Speaker 6:  lot of the other people in the space have really struggled with it. Books

682
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,040
Speaker 6:  is a great example. Like the first few miserable, there's

683
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,600
Speaker 6:  one that I'll write on and feel even remotely Okay. Writing

684
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,200
Speaker 6:  on and Remarkable has kind of a crummy ui.

685
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,770
Speaker 6:  It's the, the experience outside of the actual writing, which is wonderful,

686
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:54,750
Speaker 6:  is kind of crummy. And so if they can get those things down,

687
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,150
Speaker 6:  like that's a big success.

688
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,480
Speaker 5:  I think that's right. Yeah.

689
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,360
Speaker 10:  Yeah. I'm excited to try it. I I, I have, I upgraded to the

690
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,320
Speaker 10:  paper white from the original Kindle recently, so I'm

691
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,430
Speaker 10:  really behind the curve. So yeah, I'm

692
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:12,720
Speaker 5:  Wait like the, like the original like with a keyboard Kindle

693
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,570
Speaker 6:  That, that's incredible.

694
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,600
Speaker 10:  It was old. I don't think it had a

695
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,790
Speaker 10:  keyboard.

696
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,300
Speaker 5:  Okay.

697
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,830
Speaker 10:  But it was very old.

698
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,880
Speaker 5:  That's very

699
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,040
Speaker 10:  Important. Still though, this is what's so good about the Kindles though,

700
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,240
Speaker 10:  you know, you don't need to upgrade. It's not like a phone that you have

701
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,640
Speaker 10:  to do it every, every or feel compelled. You don't have

702
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,160
Speaker 10:  to to upgrade every year or two years. I mean, you read a

703
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,080
Speaker 10:  book on the Kindle, it still works that I only upgraded because I

704
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,840
Speaker 10:  like, I needed the bigger size cuz you know, I'm getting old. Yeah. Needed

705
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,560
Speaker 10:  bigger fonts. But yeah, I'm excited to try

706
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,030
Speaker 10:  it.

707
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,140
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's

708
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,080
Speaker 10:  But you know, Amazon did announce a lot of

709
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,880
Speaker 10:  stuff. Yeah.

710
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,130
Speaker 6:  They had a lot of stuff.

711
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,210
Speaker 10:  Do we have any more Kindle fields

712
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,880
Speaker 5:  Or? No, we'll have more Kindle fields next week. We have lots more Kindle

713
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,000
Speaker 5:  stuff

714
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,720
Speaker 6:  To do. Like I think I'll, I'm like forcing David

715
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,520
Speaker 6:  to do an entire special episode about the Kindle. So, so I think we can save

716
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,200
Speaker 6:  a lot of those feelings for future day. But yeah, there was a lot of

717
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,000
Speaker 6:  other stuff there. We got a lot of like router news. We got

718
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,550
Speaker 6:  Matter news. News that matters. I'm sorry,

719
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,910
Speaker 10:  News

720
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,640
Speaker 6:  I had to pun.

721
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,310
Speaker 10:  Well the, Yes, It's, it's just, it's like they

722
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,560
Speaker 10:  made that name, they chose that name because they're like The Verge is gonna

723
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,460
Speaker 10:  have so much fun with this name with all their puns.

724
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,080
Speaker 10:  But yes, it was so Amazon they started out with their same

725
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,910
Speaker 10:  shtick that they do every year. The ambient smart home, which is

726
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,840
Speaker 10:  Amazon, your smart home will work without a smartphone. That's essentially

727
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,270
Speaker 10:  what Amazon is saying because who doesn't have a smartphone?

728
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:49,120
Speaker 10:  Amazon. So you need to be able to use to control your home

729
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,440
Speaker 10:  without needing a smartphone. I am out totally on board with this though.

730
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,020
Speaker 10:  I do not like using a smartphone to control my home. So I'm good with that.

731
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,920
Speaker 10:  And the Ambient Smart home is what Amazon is trying to move. That's its

732
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,090
Speaker 10:  vision that it's bringing us to in its smart home

733
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,560
Speaker 10:  sensors, devices that react

734
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,160
Speaker 10:  intuitively hunches. I mean they used the, I

735
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,050
Speaker 10:  think personalization was kind of a big focus of this.

736
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:17,680
Speaker 10:  They've got new features for routines that can be

737
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,960
Speaker 10:  personalized. So when you say good morning to Alexa in the morning, it will

738
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,640
Speaker 10:  tell you your personal calendar events and your

739
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,520
Speaker 10:  traffic rather than say your husbands or your spouses. So it

740
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,250
Speaker 10:  those, there's lots of small sort of updates to how Alexa works

741
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,580
Speaker 10:  in the smart home.

742
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,910
Speaker 6:  Jen had a good run.

743
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,440
Speaker 5:  What I was gonna say did, did

744
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:36,720
Speaker 10:  You lose

745
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,640
Speaker 5:  Me? Not allowed to talk about Amazon. Oh you're back. You're asked you for

746
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:40,860
Speaker 5:  a second.

747
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,490
Speaker 10:  You lost me. Sorry. Yeah,

748
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,360
Speaker 5:  We heard, we heard your husband or your spouse and then you were gone.

749
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,160
Speaker 10:  Okay. That was okay. All right. So yes, Amazon

750
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,080
Speaker 10:  is trying to get in on the personalization front, which is, which

751
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,960
Speaker 10:  is a good angle to go for because you know most homes, they're a lot,

752
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,780
Speaker 10:  they're more than one person and the smart home does not work well

753
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,680
Speaker 10:  for more than one person right now, especially my family will

754
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,480
Speaker 10:  attest to that cuz they, they get very frustrated. But that, you know,

755
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,280
Speaker 10:  I'm a use ca I'm a, I'm a unique use case. I know I have

756
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,040
Speaker 10:  like all four voice assistant. I

757
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,920
Speaker 6:  Was gonna say, how many times are you act accidentally like turned all

758
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,600
Speaker 6:  the lights off on somebody in your home often just like plunge someone

759
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,390
Speaker 6:  in darkness possibly in a bathroom situation?

760
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:29,360
Speaker 10:  Well the biggest problem I have, and I wish someone could solve this for

761
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,920
Speaker 10:  me and this is a personalization issue, my husband is a firefighter

762
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,680
Speaker 10:  paramedic so he works shifts, which means I, if I have

763
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,350
Speaker 10:  any kind of automations or routines that work every day,

764
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,960
Speaker 10:  that is not good for someone that's trying to sleep in the middle of the

765
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,920
Speaker 10:  day and you can't set something for every third day. It just

766
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,720
Speaker 10:  doesn't exist. And that's a solution I would love to see. I want a button

767
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,760
Speaker 10:  that I can just press and this is something you can now do with Amazon.

768
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,400
Speaker 10:  They introduce buttons, we can get to that. They used to have buttons, they

769
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,800
Speaker 10:  took them away. Now they brought them back. But you, I would love a button

770
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,880
Speaker 10:  I could press it just turns off all my automations just shuts it all

771
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,560
Speaker 10:  down because I, you know it he, I get yelled

772
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,400
Speaker 10:  at Jenny, there's music playing, turn the

773
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,430
Speaker 10:  light off.

774
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,360
Speaker 6:  He's just trying to sleep and you're like, no

775
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,000
Speaker 5:  They did add some scheduling there. There were some new scheduling stuff

776
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,550
Speaker 5:  right?

777
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,120
Speaker 10:  Yeah, there were quite a few. And these

778
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,840
Speaker 10:  enhancements aren't live now. They're coming later. There was a lot of coming

779
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,800
Speaker 10:  soon coming shortly and coming soon and not coming this

780
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,280
Speaker 10:  year. Which I think was very specific

781
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,160
Speaker 10:  wording. But yes there was some scheduling updates. So you can now say

782
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,080
Speaker 10:  to Alexa, Sorry am I setting off everyone's devices? You know turn, lock

783
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,680
Speaker 10:  the front door in an hour or turn the lights off in 15

784
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,280
Speaker 10:  minutes. And that's a really nice feature to have and that could be yeah

785
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,840
Speaker 10:  that, that would help. That might help my situation a little bit. But the

786
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,360
Speaker 10:  biggest news, the thing I was most excited about and I actually got to,

787
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,200
Speaker 10:  I didn't get to see the Echos here, but they have new

788
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,160
Speaker 10:  echo dots and they're going to be mesh wifi

789
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,760
Speaker 10:  extenders. Now this is only very exciting if you already have an arrow

790
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,720
Speaker 10:  mesh network. It's only gonna work with Arrow. But the concept is

791
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,960
Speaker 10:  a good one and you know, we may see it trickle down to

792
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,880
Speaker 10:  other manufacturers that also have smart home devices and

793
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,760
Speaker 10:  routers Google. So, you know, We'll I like the idea

794
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,240
Speaker 10:  Smart home needs connectivity and Amazon realizes we

795
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,830
Speaker 10:  need to bathe your home in wifi and

796
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,500
Speaker 10:  aero devices whilst less expensive than they used to be are an investment.

797
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,400
Speaker 10:  And this way you've already got uni needed by one and if you have

798
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,880
Speaker 10:  a couple echo speakers already in your house, you are extending your, your

799
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,400
Speaker 10:  range. And it's not like super extending. Like it's not super fast wifi,

800
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,340
Speaker 10:  it's not, you're not gonna get the sick wifi six

801
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:51,160
Speaker 10:  gig. So areas wifi six has great

802
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,000
Speaker 10:  speeds if you get those speeds into your home. But most people

803
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,760
Speaker 10:  don't. Right. You know, most people aren't on gig speed internet. This gets

804
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,720
Speaker 10:  you a hundred megabits, which you know is more than enough for streaming

805
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,400
Speaker 10:  would help connect say your camera if you have a camera on the side of your

806
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,240
Speaker 10:  house. So I think this is a really good new feature because not

807
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,960
Speaker 10:  only is it in the Echo dot that they announced, which was the new Echo dot

808
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,770
Speaker 10:  and echo dot clock, which is the fifth generation, but it's also gonna be

809
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:19,120
Speaker 10:  enabled on the existing Echo dot, which is the fourth

810
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,840
Speaker 10:  generation Echo dot with clock and the existing Echo fourth

811
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,720
Speaker 10:  generation speaker. So if you have Arrow mesh, you've now

812
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,160
Speaker 10:  got so

813
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,480
Speaker 6:  So, but these are all like products that are like $50, a hundred dollars,

814
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,120
Speaker 6:  like these are are cheap. Whereas an era is usually like $200.

815
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,800
Speaker 6:  This is like a big kind of price cut to extend your

816
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,500
Speaker 6:  wifi.

817
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,480
Speaker 10:  Yes, yes. And that's what's, I mean you need good wifi for a smart

818
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,160
Speaker 10:  home to work. You need good wifi for the ambient Smart Home. And so it really

819
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,850
Speaker 10:  is in the, in the company's best interest to make sure our am our wifi

820
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:53,640
Speaker 10:  is good And this is, you know, why Ring ended up with its ring

821
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,840
Speaker 10:  alarm Pro with a built in era because so many

822
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,520
Speaker 10:  problems consumers have with Ring video doorbells are connectivity

823
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,760
Speaker 10:  based and you know, Ring can't, it's, it's too hard for them to sort of

824
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,400
Speaker 10:  troubleshoot that. And so, you know, if you, you have strong wifi, you get

825
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,280
Speaker 10:  a strong smart home and you know, there's a few other really

826
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,080
Speaker 10:  interesting upgrades for the echo dots,

827
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,520
Speaker 10:  especially the Echo Dot with clock is now gonna have a

828
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,160
Speaker 10:  scrolling l e d display, which I think is really fun. I love, yeah I love

829
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,840
Speaker 10:  l e d displays so you can have your song title scrolling along,

830
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,600
Speaker 10:  maybe your next calendar appointment. It's kind of a nice way of

831
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,560
Speaker 10:  having information without having to have a screen in your face, which I'm,

832
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,830
Speaker 10:  I'm all for cuz there's too many screens in my world.

833
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:39,660
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think, I think it's very cool and I think to me the the like

834
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:43,490
Speaker 5:  the era thing is very clever to me because like we should be clear it's not

835
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,890
Speaker 5:  turning your echo dot into an era, right? Like it is not

836
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,600
Speaker 10:  No it's not an access point. No. It's a good old fashioned wifi

837
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,120
Speaker 10:  extender like you used to plug into, you know those terrible ones you used

838
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,530
Speaker 10:  to plug in. Yeah,

839
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,960
Speaker 5:  Exactly. Yeah. That's what it's doing. So it's like you're gonna get more

840
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,440
Speaker 5:  latency, you're gonna get slower speeds, but what it is going to do is it's

841
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,000
Speaker 5:  gonna put wifi in places you might not have otherwise had wifi and that

842
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,840
Speaker 5:  alone is awesome. And I think that kind of thing is gonna be

843
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,080
Speaker 5:  super useful to tons of people. But it, and it is, especially for Amazon,

844
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,320
Speaker 5:  which is like very invested like you were saying in the idea that everything

845
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,160
Speaker 5:  in my house should be able to connect to a network. It makes that possible

846
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,400
Speaker 5:  in a way I think is very cool. And I really like the idea, like it sounds

847
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,920
Speaker 5:  like, and correct me if I'm wrong, the technology behind that is not

848
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,720
Speaker 5:  terribly sophisticated. It's just Amazon figuring out how to basically reuse

849
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,680
Speaker 5:  a thing that has wifi capabilities and so in theory this could be much more

850
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,630
Speaker 5:  pervasive even than just putting it in the Echo dot. Right?

851
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,480
Speaker 10:  Yeah. So I spoke to Nick Weaver who's the CEO of Arrow and

852
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,040
Speaker 10:  he said yes it's definitely something. So the concept is called I Built

853
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,960
Speaker 10:  In and he said they're looking at other ways of extending that

854
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,480
Speaker 10:  they, I asked about the echo shows and he said yes, that's definitely something

855
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,280
Speaker 10:  we are considering. He says more, it's a little bit more complicated but

856
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,170
Speaker 10:  it's possible. And yeah, it's all done over a software firmware update.

857
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:02,040
Speaker 10:  So it's not something you're gonna have to buy new hardware for. And this

858
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,120
Speaker 10:  is something the smart home's been really bad about, you know, again, like

859
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,240
Speaker 10:  the smartphone every two years buy a new smart thermostat, you know, that's

860
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,120
Speaker 10:  not the way the smart homes should work. Right. So yeah,

861
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,010
Speaker 10:  I think I love seeing upgrade into existing devices in,

862
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:19,080
Speaker 10:  in our home and that's another that ERO came out with. They now are gonna

863
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,330
Speaker 10:  have a new capability for internet backup.

864
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:26,260
Speaker 10:  So your wifi goes down because say Comcast

865
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,840
Speaker 10:  cut someone, cut a cable somewhere, you can actually have your entire

866
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,730
Speaker 10:  network so everything that's on your network default over to your mobile

867
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,880
Speaker 10:  hotspot from your smartphone. Or if you have another

868
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,840
Speaker 10:  wifi network in your home, some people have to, or maybe

869
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,720
Speaker 10:  you can steal your neighbor's wifi and so you can

870
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,680
Speaker 10:  keep everything up and running, which is a feature they introduced

871
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,600
Speaker 10:  with the ring alarm pro last year. It's, you know, when I tried it, my

872
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,920
Speaker 10:  smart home kind of killed it because I had so many

873
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,680
Speaker 10:  things. But it's a good feature to have, especially

874
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,040
Speaker 10:  when everyone's at home and you've gotta do both my kids are home today

875
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,520
Speaker 10:  and e-learning days because there's a hurricane and they need to do their

876
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,480
Speaker 10:  schoolwork, but if the, if the wifi went down, they'd have a backup. And

877
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,810
Speaker 10:  so I think that's another good feature that now is coming to any arrow.

878
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,280
Speaker 10:  So I really love this backwards up, you know, backwards compatibility for

879
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:17,560
Speaker 10:  devices.

880
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,200
Speaker 5:  It really does feel like we're, we're heading in the direction of Amazon

881
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,880
Speaker 5:  eventually just being like, we will be your isp, we'll give you internet

882
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,760
Speaker 5:  for free. We will run cables to your house. Just please don't let your

883
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,560
Speaker 5:  smart home go offline. Which has become, it's like the, the

884
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,280
Speaker 5:  theme of this episode is like, if only our internet connections were better,

885
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,880
Speaker 5:  right? Like wouldn't the world be a magical place? And it, it's really, it's

886
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,800
Speaker 5:  just really interesting to see Amazon in particular basically like hack

887
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,760
Speaker 5:  around every edge it can to try to find ways to make sure your

888
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,160
Speaker 5:  stuff doesn't go offline because like you just see it all the time and there's

889
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,960
Speaker 5:  like the, I I always think about the horror stories people have about like

890
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,200
Speaker 5:  when, when the Nest services go down and all of a sudden your like

891
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,120
Speaker 5:  house plunges to freezing and it's like, it just takes so little

892
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,000
Speaker 5:  for this stuff to fall apart in these really spectacular ways. And if you're

893
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,600
Speaker 5:  Amazon, you have to do absolutely everything you can to make sure that that

894
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,560
Speaker 5:  doesn't happen and it's gonna, like that fight is gonna get messy

895
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,430
Speaker 5:  cuz our internet sucks real bad everywhere.

896
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:13,270
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

897
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:14,180
Speaker 10:  Yeah.

898
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:17,900
Speaker 6:  The other day my wifi died or my, my internet died

899
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,120
Speaker 6:  and I just, I was trying to go to bed and I usually use like an automation

900
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,240
Speaker 6:  to go to bed and I was like, just couldn't get my lights to turn off. I was

901
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,630
Speaker 6:  like, I just wanna sleep now.

902
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,460
Speaker 6:  Switches. What is the stacking, Oh

903
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,750
Speaker 10:  You finished going

904
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,940
Speaker 6:  Dare. It was like very upset.

905
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,560
Speaker 5:  You just slipped at the lights on, didn't you be honest? You just slipped

906
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,210
Speaker 5:  at the lights on?

907
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:43,160
Speaker 6:  No, I have, I have a Phillips hu little light

908
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,040
Speaker 6:  switch in the other room and that I guess worked over local network, so that

909
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,840
Speaker 6:  one still worked. It didn't need to call out, so I got it turned

910
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,820
Speaker 6:  my lights off. Did I have to get outta bed? Yes,

911
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,760
Speaker 10:  Yes. Really well speaking of sleep, Amazon

912
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,700
Speaker 10:  is gonna try and help you sleep with their new halo rise. So

913
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:05,440
Speaker 10:  I'm not that excited about this product, but, but because there's a lot

914
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,320
Speaker 10:  already out there that offer this capability, but it's, it's

915
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:13,280
Speaker 10:  definitely something, they've done a nice job. There's no cameras,

916
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,880
Speaker 10:  there's no microphone, there's no speakers. So for anyone that doesn't

917
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,280
Speaker 10:  want to put any of those things by their bed, which is, you know, the large

918
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,160
Speaker 10:  majority of us, it's a good option. And I

919
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,880
Speaker 10:  like, I'm, I'm a big proponent and I'm excited about circadian

920
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,200
Speaker 10:  lighting, you know, lighting that helps you wind down or helps you wake

921
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,720
Speaker 10:  up and so that's it. It takes from the Phillips lamp that

922
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,640
Speaker 10:  Phillips has a lamp that is very similar looking to this that will,

923
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,120
Speaker 10:  you know, the light will come on gradually to wake you up in the morning

924
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,960
Speaker 10:  and apparently there's some algorithm and learning that will actually figure

925
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,760
Speaker 10:  out when you should wake up the best time to wake you up. So that'll

926
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,240
Speaker 10:  be interesting to try out. Otherwise it has a lot in common with the Google

927
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,600
Speaker 10:  Nest hub, which has the sleep sensing. Yeah, it

928
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,520
Speaker 10:  uses, I don't think they've specifically said, but I, I think it uses

929
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,480
Speaker 10:  some sort of ultrasound detection to see how your breathing rate

930
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,960
Speaker 10:  and to track your sleep. Right.

931
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,920
Speaker 6:  They said it was gonna use ultrasound to like kind of bounce off of you

932
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,760
Speaker 6:  to figure out where you are and determine if it's you, if

933
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,920
Speaker 6:  it's somebody else in the bed, if it's a pet that's some fancy

934
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,980
Speaker 6:  ultrasound

935
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,560
Speaker 10:  And to do sleep tracking so you don't have to wear a wrist fan or

936
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,280
Speaker 10:  Yeah, basically they don't, you know, you don't have to wear a

937
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,320
Speaker 6:  Wristband, anything in your bed with you. Like no

938
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,600
Speaker 6:  wearables. I thought it was kind of an interesting thing, but I did think

939
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,640
Speaker 6:  it was also weird that they're like, you know, we're not gonna put a microphone

940
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,600
Speaker 6:  in it. We're not gonna put a camera in it, but we are still

941
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,520
Speaker 6:  going to track your entire body and how your body

942
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,200
Speaker 6:  moves in the bed. So we are still doing the

943
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,620
Speaker 6:  tracking,

944
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,240
Speaker 5:  But not in a creepy way. Super normal, but

945
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,960
Speaker 6:  In a, in a, like in somehow, like, not a creepy way, but a

946
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,840
Speaker 6:  very creepy, like it was just a weird, an interesting way I think, but

947
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,710
Speaker 6:  yeah, that's, that's wild.

948
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:03,280
Speaker 10:  I still think they need, someone needs to come up with a smart alarm clock

949
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,880
Speaker 10:  that doesn't rely on a battery. Cuz I mean it does have a backup

950
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,500
Speaker 10:  battery. It doesn't rely on hardwired power because I've written about this,

951
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,000
Speaker 10:  but my, back to my husband who's gonna be so mad about me talking about

952
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,580
Speaker 10:  him so much, he will not use

953
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:21,430
Speaker 10:  any smart alarm clock I've tried to get him to use because he doesn't trust

954
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:25,160
Speaker 10:  that it's gonna wake him up because what if the power goes out

955
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,120
Speaker 10:  and you, you know, old fashioned battery, old alarm clocks always have

956
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:33,000
Speaker 10:  batteries in like, at least his did and you just stick it on your bedside

957
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,560
Speaker 10:  table and it always worked or it, it plugged in but it had a battery backup.

958
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,120
Speaker 10:  But none, you can't get smart alarm clock with a battery backup, which I

959
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,960
Speaker 10:  think is a fail. I would've, that's the one thing I was listening when they

960
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,250
Speaker 10:  announced this. It's like, come on, tell me it's got a battery in it.

961
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:50,240
Speaker 6:  No. Like, nope. Yeah, it tracks the, it also like tracks

962
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,520
Speaker 6:  the humidity in the room, the temperature in the room, the amount of light

963
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,400
Speaker 6:  in the room, which you can go get a thing at a Walmart or

964
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,320
Speaker 6:  a Target that does almost all of that for about $12. It does. That

965
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:05,240
Speaker 6:  runs off a battery. Like doesn't shine a light in your face. Yeah. And

966
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,840
Speaker 6:  no when to wake you up

967
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,850
Speaker 10:  To wake you up.

968
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:08,310
Speaker 6:  So,

969
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:12,280
Speaker 10:  Well, and the other neat thing here, and this goes to the ambient Smart

970
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,240
Speaker 10:  home again and I I I was impressed with this is when it senses that you've

971
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,000
Speaker 10:  woken up, it can run your good morning routine so you don't even have to

972
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,920
Speaker 10:  say anything or do anything. And, and that's a really nice touch. I dunno

973
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,820
Speaker 10:  how it, it's gotta be tricky there though because if it gets it wrong

974
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,870
Speaker 10:  and wakes you up, you can be really mad.

975
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,560
Speaker 5:  Yeah. If it does that once you're, you're yeah,

976
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,830
Speaker 10:  Hose it's going in the trash.

977
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:39,600
Speaker 5:  I will say, Jen, the, the next thing we need to do is we need to start slowly

978
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,640
Speaker 5:  sabotaging your husband's alarm clock. That's the move here is

979
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,480
Speaker 5:  like maybe just pour a little water on it maybe just

980
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,760
Speaker 5:  to like, like you don't want it to like totally break just slowly over the

981
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,960
Speaker 5:  course of a week, kind of fall apart and then you can start making the case

982
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,760
Speaker 5:  for all of your cool technical stuff. But I did wonder

983
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,450
Speaker 5:  the halo rise, the more I think about it, the weirder it strikes me

984
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:04,440
Speaker 5:  as a thing for Amazon to even do, like to

985
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,800
Speaker 5:  your point, there's a ton of these out there. The idea of like a, a light

986
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,160
Speaker 5:  that wakes you up based on the right time to wake you up is not particularly

987
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,120
Speaker 5:  like new or novel. People who want it can get it and it

988
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,040
Speaker 5:  doesn't, it's not really, it's not a way to talk to Alexa.

989
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,800
Speaker 5:  It's not a speaker, it's just, it's just like a, a

990
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,520
Speaker 5:  thing. I don't like What's your sense of why this is worth doing

991
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,590
Speaker 5:  for Amazon?

992
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:31,560
Speaker 10:  Well I think it, the last point that we just discussed is probably where

993
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,440
Speaker 10:  it's coming from, helping to kind of integrate it, the routines into

994
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,400
Speaker 10:  your sleep. So sleep was one area they hadn't really got their

995
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,720
Speaker 10:  wearables haven't, don't seem to have taken off. Nope. Nope. Not

996
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,560
Speaker 10:  popular. And people don't like putting echoes by their

997
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,360
Speaker 10:  bed because they have cameras in them. The echo dot with clock was

998
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,280
Speaker 10:  kind of the solution there and that has ultrasound motion sensing. So

999
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,000
Speaker 10:  you could use that. They could have, I, I'm surprised they didn't work somehow

1000
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,760
Speaker 10:  work that into the new echo dots in the way that Google Nest

1001
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,640
Speaker 10:  has done with its hub. But I, I feel like this is kind of

1002
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,480
Speaker 10:  a bit of a like me too, not me too. That's the wrong word.

1003
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,210
Speaker 10:  Samesies. You know, we've gotta have one too

1004
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:16,200
Speaker 10:  because our, because our competition has it, it's

1005
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,640
Speaker 10:  very similar in functionality to the Google Nest hub Max,

1006
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,180
Speaker 10:  which is good. Not Max, sorry, Google Nest hub without the camera.

1007
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:26,760
Speaker 10:  And actually my husband does like that. He likes the sleep tracking for

1008
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,480
Speaker 10:  that one. Okay. That was the one he allowed to have on his bedside for more

1009
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,000
Speaker 10:  than a week. But it doesn't, not having a

1010
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,960
Speaker 10:  microphone means it can't track snoring. Which is is

1011
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,440
Speaker 10:  something quite key I think for sleep, for good sleep habit is to

1012
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,360
Speaker 10:  understand if you are having sort of respiratory issues at night, that can

1013
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,840
Speaker 10:  be one of the biggest issues from a, from preventing you from having a good

1014
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,290
Speaker 10:  night's sleep. And I don't think this is gonna help with that at all. So

1015
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:55,960
Speaker 10:  it, it's, yeah like I said, it seems a bit like they felt like they

1016
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,920
Speaker 10:  needed a space on your bedside tables. They needed That's fair. They didn't

1017
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,510
Speaker 10:  want it to go somewhere else.

1018
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:05,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah, no, I buy that and I think it's, it's going to be really interesting

1019
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:09,240
Speaker 5:  to see Amazon try to start to put some of that stuff

1020
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,960
Speaker 5:  back into devices like this. Cuz I, I'm just assuming that

1021
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,510
Speaker 5:  like V2 or V3 of something like the halo rise will start to have

1022
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:20,120
Speaker 5:  speakers and microphones and more sensors and start to do some of that other

1023
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,880
Speaker 5:  stuff and I think Amazon is starting to get very good at just like sort of

1024
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,870
Speaker 5:  slowly normalizing these things into people's worlds. But I still feel

1025
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:31,710
Speaker 5:  like I don't, I don't know about either of you, but like I don't have

1026
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:35,560
Speaker 5:  just totally anti microphones on the bedside table. No

1027
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,560
Speaker 5:  cameras on the bedside table, no speakers on the bedside table. I have one

1028
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,440
Speaker 5:  of those old Casper lights that they made for like 15 minutes

1029
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,400
Speaker 5:  before Casper stopped being a good business. I love that thing. It's awesome.

1030
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,040
Speaker 10:  Yeah, it is

1031
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,160
Speaker 5:  Great. And then my phone, which is of course all of those things and I'm

1032
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,800
Speaker 5:  sure un undo all of the privacy concerns that I'm trying to solve, but it,

1033
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,440
Speaker 5:  it does feel like the bedroom definitely feels like it, it's gonna be the

1034
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,840
Speaker 5:  hardest for any of these companies to make real

1035
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,720
Speaker 5:  moves inside of. So I guess if, if Amazon can do it here, I think you're

1036
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,040
Speaker 5:  right. They're in a pretty powerful spot. I

1037
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,280
Speaker 6:  Think it's gonna be, I think it's always gonna be a challenge, right?

1038
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:12,200
Speaker 10:  Well they are hampered by, you know, by that PR angle people

1039
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:16,120
Speaker 10:  don't want Amazon tracking them. So Yeah,

1040
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,700
Speaker 10:  it is, it, it's a tough one and I think,

1041
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,720
Speaker 10:  I'm not sure this product's gonna hang around honestly I don't know that

1042
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,720
Speaker 10:  we'll see a version two or a version three. I feel like this is kind of

1043
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,160
Speaker 10:  maybe something they started developing a while ago and they're like, we

1044
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,680
Speaker 10:  don't have much else. Let throw this one in.

1045
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,390
Speaker 10:  Yeah,

1046
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,200
Speaker 6:  Just a little Tesla balloon. Pretty

1047
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,600
Speaker 5:  Quiet. There are a lot of Amazon products. Yeah,

1048
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,560
Speaker 10:  I mean we have, so there is the glow lamp they have which is similar so

1049
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,360
Speaker 10:  the Casper Glow that you can put on your bedside table and can wake you

1050
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:49,240
Speaker 10:  up gently. It doesn't have the smarts that this does in terms of

1051
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,760
Speaker 10:  tracking your sleep. But they have other devices that you know you could

1052
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,640
Speaker 10:  use that don't have speakers and cameras that give you light on your bedside

1053
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,360
Speaker 10:  table. I dunno. And I just, the design of this one too is it's

1054
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,360
Speaker 10:  doesn't really fit in with the whole kind of Amazon Echo

1055
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,320
Speaker 10:  ecosystem but we'll see. See if it might be a huge hit, who's gonna,

1056
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,680
Speaker 10:  who's testing it out? I dunno who's gonna review it. I guess that's probably

1057
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,470
Speaker 10:  gonna be me.

1058
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:14,720
Speaker 5:  I don't know. Sounds like not, I don't know. We'll see if your husband the

1059
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,000
Speaker 5:  last that

1060
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,920
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You, your husband or Victoria like just all fighting

1061
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,010
Speaker 6:  over it. Yes. Or not fighting over it.

1062
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:24,960
Speaker 5:  It is a useful reminder that Amazon's product strategy is basically to like

1063
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,800
Speaker 5:  make everything it can think of. Yeah. Make 60 of them and then put it

1064
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,800
Speaker 5:  on sale on amazon.com and just sort of see what happens. Yeah. So it's like

1065
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,400
Speaker 5:  all of this comes with like the gigantic grain of salt with the possible

1066
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,600
Speaker 5:  exception of like the Echo dot, which I suspect they know they will sell

1067
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,120
Speaker 5:  an awful lot of that. All of this is just like, see what happens. There's

1068
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:46,080
Speaker 6:  Also the TVs though, right? They they just, they announced a TV this

1069
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:50,040
Speaker 6:  week. Yeah, the 4K one that's ostensibly like

1070
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:53,920
Speaker 6:  the frame from Samsung because it lets you put pictures on your

1071
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,800
Speaker 6:  wall and it'll just like stay on all the time. But it doesn't look like

1072
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,680
Speaker 6:  a frame. It is just a tv. Like people

1073
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,590
Speaker 6:  will still look,

1074
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:06,240
Speaker 5:  It's just called leaving your TV on like what I, I don't understand this

1075
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,190
Speaker 5:  at all.

1076
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,150
Speaker 10:  Yeah, it's not,

1077
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:11,670
Speaker 5:  You're just leaving your TV on. I can do that already.

1078
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:15,440
Speaker 10:  Yeah, it, it doesn't really have the same aesthetic as the Frame. It doesn't

1079
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,400
Speaker 10:  have that nice kind of matte look but it is essentially a huge

1080
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,040
Speaker 10:  echo show on your wall now because it has all of the Alexa

1081
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,880
Speaker 10:  capabilities and built in and the widgets that you got

1082
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,370
Speaker 10:  on the new Echo show 15, which has now become a TV

1083
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:34,000
Speaker 10:  because they've turned that in. You can now use Fire TV on the Echo Show

1084
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,880
Speaker 10:  15. So those two, the fire TV products to sort

1085
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,720
Speaker 10:  of, and it makes sense to put Fire TV on the Echo Show 15, you could

1086
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,650
Speaker 10:  even put it on the Echo Show eight. I mean I try and watch

1087
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:49,380
Speaker 10:  TV on shows on that screen. It's not a terrible experience

1088
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:52,780
Speaker 10:  but it's, Amazon has had a very limited support

1089
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:56,600
Speaker 10:  for video streaming services on any of its devices other than the

1090
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,280
Speaker 10:  15. So I was excited to see Fire TV built into that. But

1091
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:04,160
Speaker 10:  this obviously is an echo, it's like an echo show on your wall for

1092
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,040
Speaker 10:  with the tv, but it's not a touchscreen. So you use this remote

1093
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,360
Speaker 10:  and actually the remote I was most excited about. I thought the new remote

1094
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,800
Speaker 10:  really was really quite interesting. Well it,

1095
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,360
Speaker 5:  It's, I totally agree. I'm so glad you said

1096
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,400
Speaker 10:  That. Well why do you like it? You tell us because

1097
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,910
Speaker 6:  You guys really love it. Peacock and Direct tv,

1098
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,630
Speaker 6:  like you needed those buttons at the bottom.

1099
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:28,310
Speaker 5:  Yeah, well a, I love a good remote just at all times

1100
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:32,200
Speaker 5:  love a good remote and b, I think they, they did a

1101
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,160
Speaker 5:  couple of things that I thought were very smart. One is to have like a, a

1102
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,720
Speaker 5:  big Alexa button, right? But the other is to like, they seem to have imagined

1103
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,680
Speaker 5:  this as a thing that you both like use sitting

1104
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:46,440
Speaker 5:  in front of your TV but also maybe sort of carry into the kitchen while you're

1105
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,240
Speaker 5:  doing stuff. Like you can program routines into wizard and two of the

1106
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,020
Speaker 5:  buttons I think are there for you to pick, to have routines

1107
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:56,970
Speaker 10:  And that's genius. I mean and they should be doing that with more,

1108
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:59,680
Speaker 10:  we need more buttons. Totally. And that's something else they've announced

1109
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,160
Speaker 10:  that we alluded to earlier. So they used to have these really cool

1110
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,000
Speaker 10:  buttons. Do you remember the Echo buttons? Yes. You could use them to like

1111
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,680
Speaker 10:  play Jeopardy. They were so far and I used, I get emails

1112
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:14,120
Speaker 10:  regularly from readers saying why did they take those away cuz they discontinued

1113
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,040
Speaker 10:  them and you can't use them anymore. And they were Bluetooth, so they were

1114
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,630
Speaker 10:  kind of flaky, but now they're introducing compatibility with

1115
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:24,440
Speaker 10:  more wireless access is I think is what is the phrase that they

1116
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,260
Speaker 10:  used. But I don't know what, they haven't given us any specific models,

1117
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,880
Speaker 10:  but being able to press a button and have one of your smart home

1118
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,600
Speaker 10:  routines run is, you know, well they don't have a smartphone so

1119
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,360
Speaker 10:  they need buttons back to that point. And it's a nice experience. Like if

1120
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:43,280
Speaker 10:  you sit down with your remote in front of your tv rather than having to

1121
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,240
Speaker 10:  say, Hey Alexa, run movie time and maybe shout because

1122
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,960
Speaker 10:  it didn't hear you properly. You just press your button. So I,

1123
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,120
Speaker 10:  I think that's a nice experience. I, I'm here. Well one of the things I'm

1124
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:57,920
Speaker 10:  going to see while I'm here at CIA is a custom, fancy, high

1125
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,400
Speaker 10:  end remote that you can't buy unless you're a custom integrator and

1126
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,760
Speaker 10:  spending a lot of money on your home. But it's, it run, it

1127
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,680
Speaker 10:  runs Google Android on the remote. So, and you can

1128
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:12,460
Speaker 10:  control your whole smart home from it. It's by Ava. Ava

1129
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:16,400
Speaker 10:  and I wanna go look at it because I wanna write a piece about how you can

1130
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,160
Speaker 10:  create the best smart home remote so someone will go and, and do it because

1131
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,720
Speaker 10:  since we lost the lottery tech harmony, we have no, there is nothing good.

1132
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,030
Speaker 10:  There are no good solutions.

1133
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,520
Speaker 5:  I agree. The world needs more remotes.

1134
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,320
Speaker 6:  Thank you for also being upset about the harmony remote. I still

1135
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:34,090
Speaker 6:  use mine. I've got the little button for my lights. I can just

1136
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:38,040
Speaker 6:  be like, okay, new routine. I just, I want all the lights off so I can

1137
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,960
Speaker 6:  watch Marvel movies and darkness. And it's wild that you can't do that

1138
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,400
Speaker 6:  with more remote. You have to use your phone. Yeah,

1139
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,800
Speaker 10:  Yeah. And you know, I wanna get the phone out of the living room, you know,

1140
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,520
Speaker 10:  because otherwise you need to really engage with your content No to

1141
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,270
Speaker 10:  scrolling while you are watching a good episode of Seahawk.

1142
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:58,520
Speaker 5:  Amen to that. No, and I think the buttons is such a good one because it's

1143
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,480
Speaker 5:  like, and Jen, you and I have talked about this before that like the, the

1144
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,480
Speaker 5:  gold standard for the smart home is like, the only way I'm gonna use it is

1145
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,840
Speaker 5:  if it's easier than walking up and flipping that light switch. And you know,

1146
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,480
Speaker 5:  it's easier than walking up and flipping that light switch is like mashing

1147
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,180
Speaker 5:  the giant green button that I have sitting right here on my desk and like

1148
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:18,160
Speaker 5:  I'm in like put buttons. I want, I want like a wall of buttons that I can

1149
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,240
Speaker 5:  just do all kinds of stuff with. I'm gonna have like a, I'm gonna have like

1150
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:25,080
Speaker 5:  a suit of buttons that I just walk around my house in like this. I

1151
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,280
Speaker 5:  can't, this sounds awesome. I'm

1152
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,760
Speaker 6:  All bolt a bunch of stream decks together and just wear all of them as a,

1153
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,600
Speaker 6:  a nice little vest.

1154
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,410
Speaker 10:  Exactly. That I would love to see.

1155
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:36,900
Speaker 5:  My pajamas are just gonna be buttons everywhere.

1156
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,480
Speaker 6:  You look great David. I

1157
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,130
Speaker 10:  Love this. I was just gonna say just the one thing, the last thing on wifi

1158
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:44,760
Speaker 10:  we didn't mention is the new fire TV cube has six E,

1159
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,600
Speaker 10:  which is quite exciting. Ooh,

1160
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,170
Speaker 6:  That is exciting.

1161
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:51,120
Speaker 10:  Oh yeah, that is a real use case. Like I've struggled to find a use case

1162
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:55,080
Speaker 10:  that I really need for six E at the moment and but streaming is the perfect

1163
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,930
Speaker 10:  one because that's the one where you want the wide bandwidth

1164
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:02,840
Speaker 10:  so that you, you know, when someone goes and like turns on their

1165
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,830
Speaker 10:  computer upstairs and does some work, you don't suddenly drop your streaming

1166
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:10,430
Speaker 10:  when you're watching your movie. So I think that that's, and you know,

1167
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:14,320
Speaker 10:  that's a really good use case. I'd like to see more of that and

1168
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,160
Speaker 10:  I I I've never really gotten comfortable with the fire TV cubes

1169
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,760
Speaker 10:  than ever worked that well for me. But I'm interested, I'm really interested

1170
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,680
Speaker 10:  in this one because of that 60 capability and being able to, I

1171
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,480
Speaker 10:  think it also connects, It has, what was the other thing? It it does, it

1172
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,520
Speaker 10:  connects to your, it

1173
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,280
Speaker 6:  Connects, it connects to your, your cable box. So you can you can plug

1174
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,650
Speaker 10:  Yes, the cable box. So you,

1175
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:38,520
Speaker 6:  My cable from your cable box directly into this and

1176
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,360
Speaker 6:  funnel it.

1177
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,440
Speaker 10:  Voice control. Yeah. Not that I have a cable box,

1178
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,650
Speaker 10:  but,

1179
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:49,600
Speaker 5:  So since, since ELI is not here, I feel obligated to be the one

1180
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,410
Speaker 5:  to remind our listeners that the HDMI pass through

1181
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:57,320
Speaker 5:  IR blaster combo is a bad idea and no one should ever try

1182
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,880
Speaker 5:  it. And everyone who has tried it, it always goes

1183
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,800
Speaker 5:  badly. Microsoft was like, Oh, turn your Xbox into your cable

1184
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,680
Speaker 5:  box. Htm I pass through. That went horribly and they lost a whole generation

1185
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,430
Speaker 5:  of game consoles. Google tried to do it with Google tv, which went

1186
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:16,160
Speaker 5:  just horrifically badly. Like Mili tweeted a thing that he

1187
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,880
Speaker 5:  wrote in 2013 where he said, we've been overlaying fancy

1188
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,400
Speaker 5:  interfaces on top of cable signals and praying for IR blasters to adequately

1189
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,920
Speaker 5:  control the boxes for years now. And it's never worked. And that was in

1190
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,670
Speaker 5:  2013. So kudos to Amazon for trying, but I

1191
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:34,250
Speaker 5:  I I am not holding my breath on this particular one, but I like the idea

1192
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,200
Speaker 5:  it should work. But

1193
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,960
Speaker 6:  You got wifi feels good six E. Yes. So you can,

1194
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,740
Speaker 6:  you don't even have to do any of it. You can skip all of that and

1195
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:46,600
Speaker 6:  and just go enjoy 4k Even when people in your

1196
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,400
Speaker 6:  home are deciding to scream stadia in the next three months before

1197
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,230
Speaker 6:  Stadia dies.

1198
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:53,910
Speaker 10:  Before it goes away.

1199
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:57,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Get rid of your cable and stream so fast over a wifi 60 pro

1200
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:57,920
Speaker 5:  solve.

1201
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,840
Speaker 10:  Well and there were a lot of other announcements. I know Ring have

1202
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,800
Speaker 10:  announcements, blink hand announcements, but I do have to just say I went

1203
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,960
Speaker 10:  to the ring booth to see their new cameras. They have new cameras and I

1204
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,800
Speaker 10:  saw the drone. You saw the

1205
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,390
Speaker 6:  Drone? How big? Oh,

1206
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:12,800
Speaker 5:  It's real. It's

1207
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,660
Speaker 10:  Real. It's, it's not that big

1208
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:20,560
Speaker 10:  but it's like the size of a toast. Piece

1209
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,540
Speaker 10:  of toast. Okay.

1210
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,040
Speaker 6:  All right.

1211
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,000
Speaker 10:  Okay. It's quite small and, but they wouldn't let me touch it but it was

1212
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,720
Speaker 10:  up in the air but it was hanging from

1213
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,560
Speaker 10:  strings. Suspicious.

1214
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,770
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Suspicious.

1215
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:37,120
Speaker 5:  Oh. So it's nothing that doesn't count. But I

1216
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:41,040
Speaker 10:  Did talk to someone who told me he has it in his house and

1217
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,800
Speaker 10:  promises it does actually work. So he says it's coming

1218
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,560
Speaker 10:  soon. Did he

1219
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,290
Speaker 6:  Show you video footage?

1220
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:48,650
Speaker 10:  No.

1221
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:51,910
Speaker 5:  It sounds like they showed you a chandelier in the shape of a drone.

1222
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:54,230
Speaker 6:  Very tiny chandelier.

1223
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,870
Speaker 5:  A very tiny chandelier.

1224
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:59,780
Speaker 10:  Yeah, it was. I was like, can I bring it down? Nope.

1225
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,930
Speaker 10:  Can I reach up and touch it? Nope. No.

1226
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:04,010
Speaker 10:  So

1227
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:05,160
Speaker 6:  It exists. It's really

1228
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,800
Speaker 5:  Exists. It exists. Take it. It's out of the renders phase so

1229
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,320
Speaker 5:  we'll we'll

1230
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,240
Speaker 10:  That seen it in person. So I felt like that was a step forward. It's in

1231
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:12,560
Speaker 10:  the

1232
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,820
Speaker 6:  Physical mockup phase.

1233
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,060
Speaker 10:  Yes.

1234
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:18,560
Speaker 6:  And in disguise home apparently.

1235
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,040
Speaker 5:  Thank goodness. Alright, we really do need to take a break. Jen, do you have

1236
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,640
Speaker 5:  a few more minutes to hang out and do a little lightning ground thing with

1237
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,120
Speaker 5:  us before we

1238
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,040
Speaker 10:  Go? Sure. Happy to.

1239
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,640
Speaker 5:  Excellent. Okay. Alright, we're gonna take a quick break and then we'll be

1240
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,800
Speaker 5:  right back to do a lightning

1241
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:36,160
Speaker 5:  round.

1242
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:35,460
Speaker 5:  We're back. There was so much other news this week, so we're

1243
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:39,140
Speaker 5:  just gonna do a little lightning round. Basically, Jen, since you're, you're

1244
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:42,700
Speaker 5:  new to this part of the show, everybody just picks a thing that happened

1245
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,560
Speaker 5:  this week that we haven't talked about yet that you thought was interesting

1246
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,900
Speaker 5:  and cool and worth talking about. And you can go last so you can have a minute

1247
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,500
Speaker 5:  to decide what you thought was interesting that you wanna talk about. Alex,

1248
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,230
Speaker 5:  what do you have?

1249
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:57,150
Speaker 6:  Oh, it was absolutely the Intel Samsung slidable

1250
01:08:57,150 --> 01:09:01,020
Speaker 6:  pc. Yeah. That they showed off at the Intel event. We, we've, we've

1251
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:04,180
Speaker 6:  kind of, everybody's been alluding to something like this was gonna happen

1252
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:07,660
Speaker 6:  at some point. We've seen phone versions of this, this was a laptop

1253
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:11,540
Speaker 6:  version and it, you're initially like, that's so cool. And then you

1254
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:15,500
Speaker 6:  watch the video and the guy's kind of fighting with it a little as he pulls

1255
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:19,460
Speaker 6:  it out. So, you know, like, oh that's, that experience is not

1256
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:23,260
Speaker 6:  smooth yet. That's not coming this month to a Best

1257
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,930
Speaker 6:  Buy. Dear you,

1258
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:28,500
Speaker 5:  I've watched that video so many times now and I cannot figure

1259
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:32,300
Speaker 5:  out how it works. It's just like, it, it's, I just keep

1260
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:36,180
Speaker 5:  getting like fruit by the foot vibes from it where it just sort of, you just,

1261
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:40,090
Speaker 5:  you just like peel it out from itself as it opens up. It's very,

1262
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:41,860
Speaker 5:  it's very weird. I don't know. It's

1263
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:45,050
Speaker 6:  It's, it's the same thing that, that LG is doing with its

1264
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:48,930
Speaker 6:  rollable TVs, which I think Jen, you get to, you might get to see one,

1265
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:52,620
Speaker 6:  I know they're showing one at cia. They just announced a 42 inch one.

1266
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,570
Speaker 6:  I'm stealing all of the lightning rounds. I'm sorry.

1267
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:58,140
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I haven't got to see it yet, but it is here. But

1268
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:01,140
Speaker 6:  It's just an all led and all LEDs have gotten to the point where you can

1269
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:04,620
Speaker 6:  kind of, I want you to please like send me pictures

1270
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,980
Speaker 6:  just just to me personally. You don't have to put them on the website or

1271
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:11,260
Speaker 6:  anything like that. We don't need that, but I just, I just wanna see them

1272
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:14,180
Speaker 6:  myself. But but it's the same, it's the same concept, right? It's just an

1273
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:17,860
Speaker 6:  all LED display that that's really kind of tightly wound

1274
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:21,820
Speaker 6:  up and, and because it's Samsung and Samsung's gotten very good at

1275
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:25,340
Speaker 6:  this like bindy old led technology, right? They,

1276
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:29,060
Speaker 6:  they're better than anybody. They figured out a way to like make it tight

1277
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:32,510
Speaker 6:  enough to make it pretty selt looking device.

1278
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:36,500
Speaker 6:  Notably it just showed an image. There's was no

1279
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:39,820
Speaker 6:  computing or anything really happening with the thing. Yeah, I

1280
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:43,580
Speaker 6:  wouldn't, this is just a proof of concept that a

1281
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:47,200
Speaker 6:  display like this could work and then now they have to pack it into a thing

1282
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:51,130
Speaker 6:  and every other time we've seen like what about foldable laptop

1283
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:54,780
Speaker 6:  that Scott screens everywhere that like the

1284
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:58,560
Speaker 6:  mockup is, you know, a few millimeters tall

1285
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,830
Speaker 6:  and then the actual product's like four inches, right?

1286
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:05,240
Speaker 6:  So yeah, this is not gonna be in your next iPad,

1287
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,860
Speaker 6:  but it's just cool.

1288
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:09,940
Speaker 5:  These always kind of bum me out if I'm being completely honest. Really? Because

1289
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:12,560
Speaker 5:  they're like, they're very cool and you look at them and they're very exciting

1290
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,950
Speaker 5:  and then inevitably there's that like one line in the story

1291
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:19,680
Speaker 5:  that's basically just like, this is just a science project that some guy

1292
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,560
Speaker 5:  made in a lab. Yeah. And they have no plans to do anything with it. And this

1293
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:27,480
Speaker 5:  one screen that they showed you, this demo costs $6 million and,

1294
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,920
Speaker 5:  and it will almost certainly never be a product. And I just get to the end

1295
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:34,480
Speaker 5:  and I'm like, ah, that was a cool like basically

1296
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,920
Speaker 5:  animated gift that I, that's

1297
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,900
Speaker 6:  What we, that's the way that was the foldable phone for years

1298
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,240
Speaker 6:  now it's like an That's

1299
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:41,960
Speaker 5:  True.

1300
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,680
Speaker 6:  Maybe almost mature

1301
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,640
Speaker 10:  Everywhere here. Everyone has it here. Really? That's cuz everyone's

1302
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,410
Speaker 10:  from Samsung

1303
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:54,040
Speaker 5:  Is everybody just walking around doing like cool moves where they like aggressively

1304
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,680
Speaker 5:  close their flip phone when they're done slap

1305
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,490
Speaker 6:  It close

1306
01:11:57,490 --> 01:12:00,480
Speaker 5:  Or it's like at the end of the meeting everybody like folds on cue and then

1307
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:00,920
Speaker 5:  you stand up and

1308
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,440
Speaker 6:  The end of every presentation they snap 'em shut and walk off

1309
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:07,060
Speaker 10:  Stage. I do. I want one. So cool. Yeah.

1310
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,870
Speaker 6:  All right. David, what was yours?

1311
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:12,560
Speaker 5:  I I feel obligated to talk about Stage Manager. I don't want

1312
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,520
Speaker 5:  to to be clear Stage manager just makes me

1313
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,040
Speaker 5:  angry and sad. But there was stage Manager news and I feel

1314
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:23,480
Speaker 5:  obligated to talk about it. So the, the news this week was that Apple is

1315
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,880
Speaker 5:  bringing Stage Manager, which it originally said was only gonna be

1316
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,840
Speaker 5:  for iPads with an M one processor to I think

1317
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,600
Speaker 5:  the most recent two generations of iPad

1318
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,560
Speaker 5:  Pros, it's coming to those without one feature, which is the external

1319
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,000
Speaker 5:  display support. So you won't be able to run Stage Manager on a monitor while

1320
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,960
Speaker 5:  also having your, your screen. Oh no. But it's

1321
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,800
Speaker 5:  terrible. But they, but they're bringing Stage Manager to other things, which

1322
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,760
Speaker 5:  to strikes me as exactly the wrong impulse. Like to me there should just

1323
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:56,720
Speaker 5:  be one, they should make one iPad, not even like a model, just

1324
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,680
Speaker 5:  one iPad that runs Stage Manager and give it to Craig UE because he

1325
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:04,260
Speaker 5:  really likes it and no one else should have to have stage manager like Fork

1326
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,930
Speaker 5:  iOS for Craig and leave the rest of us alone. No one else

1327
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:11,790
Speaker 5:  do not have Stage Manager. That's, that's that's what I want. Not more,

1328
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:15,440
Speaker 5:  less. And it does seem like the, the betas keep coming of

1329
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:19,190
Speaker 5:  iPad OS and Stage Manager seems to be getting it's coming David.

1330
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:23,050
Speaker 5:  It's, I know it's coming and it makes me sad and it seems to be getting better

1331
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:26,880
Speaker 5:  in some ways and worse in other ways and it's like, it's just, it's

1332
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,600
Speaker 5:  just a mess. But the good news is many more people are going to get to experience

1333
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,500
Speaker 5:  the mess. So congratulations everybody.

1334
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:37,440
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm so excited to experience the mess with all the M one

1335
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,880
Speaker 6:  iPad Pro owners. It's

1336
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,760
Speaker 5:  Just not good. That's the thing. It's just not good. You're

1337
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:46,600
Speaker 6:  Like, it's just bad. What, what are you gonna do if it

1338
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:50,460
Speaker 6:  comes out and somehow between the latest beta release

1339
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:54,240
Speaker 6:  and, and the release of the new os it, it

1340
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,230
Speaker 6:  gets good.

1341
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:59,200
Speaker 5:  I'll be psyched. Are you kidding? I've spent a decade trying to get

1342
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,900
Speaker 5:  better multitasking on the iPad out of Apple. And this is like

1343
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:06,260
Speaker 5:  the most, I was gonna say the most interesting

1344
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:09,500
Speaker 5:  idea. It's, it's, it's un Kyle be

1345
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,050
Speaker 6:  Good ever.

1346
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:13,680
Speaker 5:  I don't know, maybe potentially I could be onto

1347
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,160
Speaker 6:  Something.

1348
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,880
Speaker 5:  Craig loves his piles, that's all I know. And Craig, Craig

1349
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,120
Speaker 5:  likes weed jokes and piles. Those are the two things that we know about Craig.

1350
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:25,840
Speaker 10:  I've given up on trying to multitask on the iPad. Honestly I

1351
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,200
Speaker 10:  just, I it it was so it's never been a good

1352
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:33,080
Speaker 10:  experience. So, but also I don't want to multitask

1353
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:37,040
Speaker 10:  on my iPad that much. I like using my iPad as my non multitasking

1354
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,200
Speaker 10:  device. It's like Picker Lane. Is this a computer? It's

1355
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,390
Speaker 6:  My focus device. That's fair.

1356
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:45,900
Speaker 5:  Well I think the problem is that there continues to be this very small

1357
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:49,800
Speaker 5:  but incredibly loud minority of people who want

1358
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,560
Speaker 5:  to do like real like capital P power user stuff on their

1359
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,520
Speaker 5:  iPad. Yeah. And those people have tend to have a very loud voice

1360
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,840
Speaker 5:  on the internet and talk about this stuff a lot on the internet. And so they

1361
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:04,680
Speaker 5:  drown out the people I think who are most iPad users and, and it seems

1362
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:08,600
Speaker 5:  like Apple has struggled to make both sides happy and I think

1363
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:12,360
Speaker 5:  is sort of increasingly pushing towards this. Like how do we give the power

1364
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,120
Speaker 5:  users more stuff to do and I'm not sure that

1365
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,960
Speaker 5:  that actually turns out to be the right strategy all the time. Well

1366
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,560
Speaker 6:  I think they run into this problem of like they've got this M one, they've

1367
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,440
Speaker 6:  got these really nice processors in it, they've got the M one process in

1368
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,930
Speaker 6:  it. Yeah. And so it's like, okay, that's the same one as then the laptop.

1369
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:30,040
Speaker 6:  So it should be able to do laptop stuff and it's like, no it shouldn't. Maybe

1370
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:34,000
Speaker 6:  you shouldn't have put that in there. Maybe we don't need a $2,000 when

1371
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,430
Speaker 6:  you get the stuff. iPads.

1372
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:39,240
Speaker 10:  I was sold on the argument that the iPad was now a

1373
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,120
Speaker 10:  computer once they brought the iPad Pro out with the

1374
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,720
Speaker 10:  keyboard and my husband went back to school, I'm sorry, my husband

1375
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:50,140
Speaker 10:  again. So we got him an iPad

1376
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:54,000
Speaker 10:  Pro and he did three year, three years of college within

1377
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,480
Speaker 10:  it as his main computer. Wow. I felt like this was a big test for

1378
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:01,220
Speaker 10:  how com and he's not techy, he doesn't really

1379
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:05,040
Speaker 10:  use computers. He, you know, so this was a real challenge

1380
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,880
Speaker 10:  and it failed spectacularly And

1381
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:12,680
Speaker 10:  it really did. I mean he survived, he

1382
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:16,480
Speaker 10:  graduated with honors but it, it

1383
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,160
Speaker 10:  couldn't half the time I would have to pull out my computer to help him

1384
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:24,060
Speaker 10:  access something and then upload it to the, to the iPad for him and,

1385
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:27,920
Speaker 10:  and it just, he could write his paper on it. That was fine.

1386
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,960
Speaker 10:  That's what the main thing he wanted to do. But to use things, some of these

1387
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,880
Speaker 10:  tools like Blackboard and Canvas that a lot of these college programs use

1388
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,790
Speaker 10:  and schools use, it just didn't work. It was,

1389
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:42,520
Speaker 10:  anyway, it was, it was, it was not a good experience. And that

1390
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,520
Speaker 10:  Apple keyboard that comes with it or doesn't come with it, Sorry that you

1391
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,320
Speaker 10:  spend a very small fortune on it's worn

1392
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:53,160
Speaker 10:  away. I can't read any of the keys on it. Oh. And it was,

1393
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:57,040
Speaker 10:  he's only had it for a couple of years. So yeah, it was not, it was not

1394
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,880
Speaker 10:  a success. I was very disappointed. But now it's a great TV watching device

1395
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,280
Speaker 10:  for him now that he's graduated.

1396
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:06,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah, there you go. It it does the the iPad fails very gracefully

1397
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,840
Speaker 5:  over the course of its life, which I appreciate about it. It, it's, I've

1398
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,520
Speaker 5:  always liked that. Alright, Jen, what's, what's yours? What's your lightning

1399
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:12,950
Speaker 5:  round?

1400
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:16,730
Speaker 10:  Okay, so I have big gadget news in the smart home

1401
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:20,680
Speaker 10:  is Roomba has its new or iRobot has, its new Roomba this week.

1402
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,440
Speaker 10:  They announced just the day before the Amazon event because technically

1403
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,840
Speaker 10:  they're, no they're not owned by Amazon yet, although Amazon is trying.

1404
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,610
Speaker 10:  Right. And they have announced

1405
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:34,430
Speaker 10:  finally very late to the party AO

1406
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:38,320
Speaker 10:  vacuum and mop in one. But what's neat

1407
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:42,130
Speaker 10:  about it is that it actually is a robotic mop.

1408
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:45,880
Speaker 10:  So all the other mops you have to kinda, although other robot vacuums that

1409
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:49,410
Speaker 10:  have mops, you have to stick the mop on, like you have to pick it up and

1410
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:50,160
Speaker 5:  Oh right,

1411
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:53,040
Speaker 10:  Stick it on the bottom of the robot. Yeah. And then it goes off and does

1412
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,870
Speaker 10:  its job. This one Roomba has, it kind of

1413
01:17:56,870 --> 01:18:00,680
Speaker 10:  raises itself up on aluminum arms and then slides itself

1414
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:04,320
Speaker 10:  underneath the robot and then goes off and does its mopping and then when

1415
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:08,000
Speaker 10:  it's done or if it comes to up to carpet, it will

1416
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,840
Speaker 10:  stop and then lift the mop up and put it on back on top

1417
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:15,530
Speaker 10:  of the robot, vacuum the carpet and then vice versa

1418
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:19,400
Speaker 10:  as it goes off around on its merry way to clean your house. So

1419
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,170
Speaker 10:  basically it's the two in one. You don't have to get your hands dirty

1420
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:25,730
Speaker 10:  at all if you want to mop and vacuum.

1421
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:29,600
Speaker 5:  So is there just a gross wet mop inside of your Roomba

1422
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,290
Speaker 5:  at all times now?

1423
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:36,680
Speaker 10:  So you do. Yes, that's the option.

1424
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,920
Speaker 5:  Okay. I mean that's fine. It's just gonna take me a minute to get used

1425
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,270
Speaker 5:  to.

1426
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:44,470
Speaker 6:  What's that smell? I haven't changed the mop in my Roomba lately.

1427
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,140
Speaker 13:  Yeah. Yes,

1428
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,110
Speaker 13:  yes.

1429
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:52,960
Speaker 10:  It's, it's removable. You just rip it off, it's Velcro

1430
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,510
Speaker 10:  washable, throw it in the washing machine and then you do have to

1431
01:18:56,510 --> 01:19:00,080
Speaker 10:  manually attach it to the bottom of the mop plate when you,

1432
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,920
Speaker 10:  when you want it to be clean. But it has, it has a water tank in,

1433
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,800
Speaker 10:  so it's squirting water onto the mop. So keeping it damp as it goes

1434
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,680
Speaker 10:  around and it has, it's smart enough. So iRobot has their, what

1435
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:15,280
Speaker 10:  they call the robot os the fifth generation that kind of

1436
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,240
Speaker 10:  helps make the robot smarter and it applies to all their robots, not

1437
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,750
Speaker 10:  just the new one, which is called the Roomba combo J seven

1438
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:26,400
Speaker 10:  plus that it will go, when it goes into a

1439
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:30,300
Speaker 10:  room, it does the, it will go intelligently

1440
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,920
Speaker 10:  and do like the mopping first and then vacuum the carpets or vacuum the

1441
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,680
Speaker 10:  carpets first and then mop. So it can be efficient rather than having

1442
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:41,040
Speaker 10:  to stop and reload its mop every time it comes across a carpet

1443
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,360
Speaker 10:  because it can map your room so it knows where your carpets

1444
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:47,960
Speaker 10:  are or where your rugs are versus your hardwood floor or your tile

1445
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:51,680
Speaker 10:  floor. So I'm, it's an inex very expensive robot over

1446
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:55,160
Speaker 10:  a thousand dollars. But it does come with the auto empty base so you don't

1447
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:58,800
Speaker 10:  have to get your hands dirty, empty in the, the little bin. Yeah. You do

1448
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,720
Speaker 10:  have to fill it up with water and yes, you do need to clean them mop.

1449
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,810
Speaker 10:  You can't just leave the mo.

1450
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:08,640
Speaker 6:  So sort of like every morning before you leave, leave the house, you feed

1451
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:12,320
Speaker 6:  the dog, you give the dog water and then you go and you like

1452
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:16,260
Speaker 6:  feed the mop into your Roomba. You're like, goodbye guys, have fun

1453
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:19,200
Speaker 6:  and, and, and leave. That's like the idea. Yeah.

1454
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,040
Speaker 10:  And then the robot will will actually that, that's one of the good things.

1455
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,920
Speaker 10:  They just came out with a new capability in this new os to

1456
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,800
Speaker 10:  avoid pet bowls or if you want clean really

1457
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,430
Speaker 10:  well around pet bowls so that it has, so it has visual, it has

1458
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:38,400
Speaker 10:  artificial intelligence that helps identify a pet bowl

1459
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,280
Speaker 10:  and know that it shouldn't bang into it because rumors do bang into furniture.

1460
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:45,120
Speaker 10:  I've actually had a rumor knock my chairs down

1461
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,770
Speaker 10:  regularly, but now it can identify a pet bowl

1462
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:52,680
Speaker 10:  or a litter box and not bang into it, but it will

1463
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:56,600
Speaker 10:  also, but it'll clean and mop closely around it so

1464
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,440
Speaker 10:  that you can come home to a nice clean pet bowl rather than a

1465
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:04,360
Speaker 10:  sloshed mess that your, that your rumor is created

1466
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,350
Speaker 10:  while you are gone.

1467
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:10,000
Speaker 5:  That's pretty good. I I make a lot of fun of fancy Roombas, but I also own

1468
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,840
Speaker 5:  a fancy Roomba and I love it to pieces like it is, it is a

1469
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:17,800
Speaker 5:  truly glorious device to own. And I got the one that

1470
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,400
Speaker 5:  like empties itself and it just, it just runs and I don't think about it.

1471
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:25,120
Speaker 5:  And it is, it is truly, truly delightful. So when they make one of these

1472
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,680
Speaker 5:  that goes into like a swimming pool and cleans itself at the end of the day,

1473
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:32,130
Speaker 5:  like that's, that's where the magic happens. I want one that goes right into

1474
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:36,000
Speaker 5:  my washing machine at the end of the day and cleans itself and then

1475
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,720
Speaker 5:  just sort of scoots

1476
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,390
Speaker 6:  Back.

1477
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:41,280
Speaker 10:  Well they do have, there are two that will clean their own bottoms as I

1478
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,960
Speaker 10:  like to say, but they, and it goes in,

1479
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,900
Speaker 10:  there's the Omni by Debar and then Robo Rock has one

1480
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:52,760
Speaker 10:  and it goes in and like scrubs the mop and then like blows little hot air

1481
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:56,540
Speaker 10:  on it to, to dry the mop so that you never have to deal with it.

1482
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:58,120
Speaker 10:  But that one's even more expensive.

1483
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,760
Speaker 5:  It's like a little car wash for your, for your robot bag. It

1484
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,960
Speaker 10:  Is a car wash for your robot vacuum. Exactly. And it makes it funny little

1485
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:04,480
Speaker 10:  noise. It's like,

1486
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:09,910
Speaker 10:  yeah,

1487
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:11,310
Speaker 5:  That's, that's pretty good.

1488
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:14,760
Speaker 6:  I love it. This is the closest I've ever felt to wanting to buy one of these

1489
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:15,800
Speaker 6:  things. Thank you.

1490
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:19,360
Speaker 5:  It's it's worth it. It will change your life. It, it feels ridiculous when

1491
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,640
Speaker 5:  you're buying it from experience. I can say there, there is a time when you're

1492
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,920
Speaker 5:  gonna look at it and be like, am I really about to spend all of this money

1493
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,760
Speaker 5:  on this thing? Like I could just vacuum like a person and

1494
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:29,360
Speaker 5:  then, but

1495
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,040
Speaker 6:  Then your floors are clean

1496
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:33,870
Speaker 5:  And then you don't have to vacuum like a person. It's great.

1497
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:37,700
Speaker 10:  I do have one more gadget if you want, if you want one more lightning gadget

1498
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:38,200
Speaker 5:  For it.

1499
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:42,000
Speaker 10:  Sure do it. So ufi, which is Anchor's Smart Home

1500
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,800
Speaker 10:  brand, has released a very interesting new camera

1501
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:49,560
Speaker 10:  system. It is the UFI cam three

1502
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,320
Speaker 10:  and it comes with a home base three. And what it, it's artificially

1503
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:57,160
Speaker 10:  intelligent intelligence powered data processing that does it all

1504
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,760
Speaker 10:  locally on the little home base in your house. So it's not sending your

1505
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:04,560
Speaker 10:  video up to the cloud. And it has facial recognition,

1506
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,400
Speaker 10:  animal pet recognition, vehicle detection. So

1507
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,920
Speaker 10:  that the idea is you shouldn't get hundreds of annoying alerts saying there's

1508
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,680
Speaker 10:  motion at your door. It'll say there's a person at your door or there's

1509
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:19,200
Speaker 10:  a dog or a pet or a vehicle and then the facial

1510
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:22,880
Speaker 10:  recognition kicks in and it can say there's a stranger in your yard as

1511
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:26,800
Speaker 10:  opposed to your husband's in your yard or David's in his yard. Oh wow. Alex

1512
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,190
Speaker 10:  is in and that's,

1513
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:30,120
Speaker 6:  I don't have a yard.

1514
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:34,040
Speaker 5:  Alex is frequently in my yard though I never, I never ask but she's frequently

1515
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:34,650
Speaker 5:  in my yard

1516
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:37,360
Speaker 6:  At the window Peaky again, which has,

1517
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:38,820
Speaker 6:  there,

1518
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:42,480
Speaker 10:  You get facial recognition on a number of cameras these days, but most of

1519
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:46,240
Speaker 10:  it has has to have some kind of cloud component for the

1520
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:50,160
Speaker 10:  processing. Whereas this is all edge processing, which is really makes a

1521
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:53,740
Speaker 10:  lot faster, which means for a security system is is pretty crucial.

1522
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:57,240
Speaker 10:  And it also has up to 16 terabytes of local

1523
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,930
Speaker 10:  storage, which they tell me can hold 60 years

1524
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:04,880
Speaker 10:  of video before you need to erase any of it. You have

1525
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:08,840
Speaker 10:  to buy the extra storage separately. Cause obviously a 16 terabyte

1526
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:12,680
Speaker 10:  hard drive is not cheap. Yeah. But it, when

1527
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:16,480
Speaker 10:  you buy one of these, when you add a hard drive to it, you could add a

1528
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:20,440
Speaker 10:  terabyte hard drive up to 16. It gives you continuous

1529
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:24,080
Speaker 10:  video recording. So 24 7 video recording, which again is something that

1530
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,960
Speaker 10:  really doesn't exist in this in the DIY smart home space right now Google

1531
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:31,800
Speaker 10:  Nest has it on some of its cameras, but it's not a big, it's

1532
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:35,240
Speaker 10:  something a lot of people ask for but most companies don't offer because

1533
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,230
Speaker 10:  you're using cloud storage but this doesn't

1534
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:40,980
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And it's not going to the cloud. So it's like if, if I fall down

1535
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:44,720
Speaker 6:  and accidentally record myself looking like a dumbass because I fell

1536
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,130
Speaker 6:  down, no one will ever know.

1537
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:51,120
Speaker 10:  No one's gonna, no one's gonna see it. No. And

1538
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:51,590
Speaker 10:  they,

1539
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:53,300
Speaker 6:  I can delete the footage

1540
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:56,970
Speaker 10:  And bringing this back to how we started, what I really love about this

1541
01:24:56,970 --> 01:25:00,240
Speaker 10:  is they have new cameras that come with the home base three's, the UFI cam

1542
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:04,040
Speaker 10:  three, you know 4k, they have built in solar power. It's,

1543
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:08,000
Speaker 10:  it's a, it's, it's an impressive system. But if you have UFI

1544
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,480
Speaker 10:  cams and you buy the home base three, this AI

1545
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:15,280
Speaker 10:  capability, which UFI calls its bionic mind will

1546
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:18,600
Speaker 10:  work on all your existing cameras. So it works every,

1547
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:18,840
Speaker 6:  That's

1548
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,560
Speaker 10:  Dope. UFI cam. So you're basically upgrading your existing

1549
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,320
Speaker 10:  cameras by adding this hub. So and that's a

1550
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:30,120
Speaker 10:  really, you know, that's a good strategy for companies. I think that's improve

1551
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:33,030
Speaker 10:  the company, improve what you already have.

1552
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:36,880
Speaker 6:  I was like that. No, that's like I, I don't need any cameras in my home,

1553
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,720
Speaker 6:  but if I did, that would be incredible. That's what I would want. That's

1554
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,440
Speaker 5:  Perfect. Yeah. And especially now that that stuff is like trickling down

1555
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,360
Speaker 5:  to all these other brands that, that's especially ones

1556
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,840
Speaker 5:  that aren't trying to like charge you an arm and a leg for other stuff. That's

1557
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:51,200
Speaker 5:  pretty exciting.

1558
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,560
Speaker 10:  Yeah, there's no fees for this. You just buy the device, stick it in your

1559
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,000
Speaker 10:  home and it will keep going for 60 days, 60

1560
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,840
Speaker 5:  Years, 60 years. And I'm sure all the gadgets will last that

1561
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,800
Speaker 5:  long also. It'll be great. Alright, we have gone way over

1562
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,570
Speaker 5:  Jen. Thank you for going to that deeply sad looking press room

1563
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:12,320
Speaker 5:  to hang out with us. But yeah, thank you both. Tons of good stuff on the

1564
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,280
Speaker 5:  verge. Esther weighing wrote a great piece about the campaign to stop Asian

1565
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,440
Speaker 5:  hate. You should go read that. I'm supposed to promote decoder on this show,

1566
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,240
Speaker 5:  but NE's not here. So I will absolutely not do that. Don't do it. And no

1567
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:24,420
Speaker 5:  circumstances should you go listen Toco, don't watch it. We're gonna have

1568
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:28,000
Speaker 5:  the third episode of our future music series on

1569
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,400
Speaker 5:  Monday. The first two have been really awesome. It's been, it's been really

1570
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:35,080
Speaker 5:  fun. Yeah, it's two, two great, great shows so far. I'm hosting the third

1571
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,120
Speaker 5:  one and I'm confident it will be the least good of the three, but it'll still

1572
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:42,080
Speaker 5:  be fun. So check that out. We're gonna be back next Wednesday. We're doing

1573
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,920
Speaker 5:  some more earbuds testing and I know there are some people who hate that

1574
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:48,640
Speaker 5:  segment, so I'm sorry, but we're doing it anyway. We're gonna have more Amazon

1575
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,650
Speaker 5:  stuff to talk about because we're not done talking about Kindles. We're also,

1576
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:54,840
Speaker 5:  if you have cybersecurity mysteries, we're doing an episode at the end of

1577
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:58,680
Speaker 5:  October all about cybersecurity. So if you have some weird cybersecurity

1578
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,760
