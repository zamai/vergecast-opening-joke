00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,640
Speaker 2:  technically big fat flakes but it's super warm so they're not actually

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,040
Speaker 2:  sticking. But it's a nice change of pace because if you didn't know

Speaker 2:  until yesterday, north Texas had actually gotten more

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,400

Speaker 3:  much

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,370
Speaker 3:  Toyota. Let's go places.

38
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,200
Speaker 2:  Okay, welcome back. Apple's Big HomePod has

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,880
Speaker 2:  returned.

40
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,720
Speaker 2:  The second gin HomePod is not that much different from the original, but

41
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,640
Speaker 2:  it has added a couple of updates including for like audio for the

42
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,280
Speaker 2:  smart home, even some of the home theater stuff. So I had to get together

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,880
Speaker 2:  with Jennifer Patterson Tui, who has been reviewing it from

44
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,760
Speaker 2:  like the smart home perspective and Chris Welch who's been reviewing it from

45
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,520
Speaker 2:  like that audio nerd perspective. And then Eli Patel who

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,440
Speaker 2:  reviewed the original one way back in 2018. Let's get to the convo.

47
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,400
Speaker 2:  I've got three incredible people with, with me, well two incredible people

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,080
Speaker 2:  in NEI with me to talk about. Wow. To talk

49
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,960
Speaker 2:  about the new home pod. Nei Tellis here.

50
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,520
Speaker 2:  Hi Nei.

51
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,520
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna just interpret this the other way, which is that y'all are incredible

52
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,200
Speaker 4:  but I'm fabulous. I

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,560
Speaker 2:  Love that. That is exactly what I meant. You

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,360
Speaker 4:  Gotta look inward to your own heart and find your own validation in life.

55
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,040
Speaker 4:  That's a real lesson when you hit 40.

56
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,600
Speaker 2:  Jen Tuey is here.

57
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,360
Speaker 5:  Hello. I'm very pleased to be here also. Feeling fabulous. There

58
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,440
Speaker 4:  You go. See, welcome to my team Jen. We're the fun ones.

59
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,160
Speaker 2:  And Chris Walters here.

60
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,280
Speaker 6:  Hello. I'm surrounded by three home pods right now, so Wow. A party

61
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,560
Speaker 6:  over

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,240
Speaker 5:  Here. They're taking over. Okay,

63
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,920
Speaker 2:  Well this will surprise no one. We're talking about the home pod today. Jen

64
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,320
Speaker 2:  and Chris have a review. They're up on the site right now. You can go read

65
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,920
Speaker 2:  it and see their, their feelings or you can listen to this

66
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,240
Speaker 4:  Or both. This is like a, like a spatial audio DVD commentary. What you need

67
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,840
Speaker 4:  to do as you're reading review, play this podcast

68
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,520
Speaker 4:  from three or four home pods. Play strategically throughout your

69
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:58,960
Speaker 4:  home

70
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,880
Speaker 2:  And we're slowly all creeping up on you. It's gonna be great. All right,

71
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,480
Speaker 2:  so, so this is kind of a big deal for them because we thought the HomePod

72
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,400
Speaker 2:  was dead or at least pretty done and now there's a whole new one.

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,880
Speaker 2:  How different is it Jen, from like a smart home perspective?

74
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,200
Speaker 5:  Well, from the smart home side, it's actually very different from the

75
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,520
Speaker 5:  original home pod. Okay. It's identical to the HomePod Mini.

76
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,480
Speaker 5:  There's like no difference other than

77
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,440
Speaker 5:  $200. Well the, the one thing that's different, I'll take

78
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,400
Speaker 5:  that back one, one small but large difference is speed. So the

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,280
Speaker 5:  new HomePod has the fastest, has a fastest processor, it has

80
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,200
Speaker 5:  the S seven, whereas the HomePod mini has the S

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,440
Speaker 5:  five. And that is the one thing I definitely noticed

82
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,240
Speaker 5:  that the new HomePod, the HomePod two responded

83
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,920
Speaker 5:  very snappily to my Siri requests very few

84
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,600
Speaker 5:  on it or

85
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,000
Speaker 5:  compared to the mini, which you know has is getting a little long in the

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,520
Speaker 5:  tooth. You know it's turning three this year. So there's, you know what you

87
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,040
Speaker 5:  would expect to see a bit more speed but feature parody is identical

88
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,840
Speaker 5:  between the two. There are a lot of new features though. There's a lot of

89
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,760
Speaker 5:  sound focus outside of audio sound which Chris I'm sure is gonna

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,880
Speaker 5:  regal us with. But there's a new feature coming in the spring

91
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,560
Speaker 5:  as actually not here yet, which is gonna turn the, the mini and the HomePod

92
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,040
Speaker 5:  two into a smoke alarm and co monoxide

93
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,760
Speaker 5:  alarm detector. Not the sound detector. So it's not

94
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,440
Speaker 5:  actually turning into a smoke alarm, but it will listen for your smoke alarms

95
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,120
Speaker 5:  and your carbon monoxide alarms because they have unique signatures and that

96
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,920
Speaker 5:  will come in the spring and mean you'll get sent an alert to your

97
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,880
Speaker 5:  phone if one of your home pods in your home, here's an alarm going off.

98
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,800
Speaker 5:  Which is a very useful feature that all the other smart home speakers

99
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,760
Speaker 5:  already do. Which is kind of a theme in my review is

100
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,640
Speaker 5:  that this is really Siri and the the HomePod kind of playing catch up

101
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,360
Speaker 5:  in the smart home space and adding a lot of features that are

102
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,800
Speaker 5:  great and super handy and that everyone else already did

103
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,400
Speaker 5:  so. But that's good for Apple Home users who are, you know, a dedicated bunch

104
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,080
Speaker 5:  and who don't necessarily want to switch ecosystems to get some of these

105
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,040
Speaker 5:  features. You know, we finally have multiple timers which has, those have

106
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,800
Speaker 5:  been around for a little while now and

107
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,280
Speaker 5:  those have been actually around for a year or so. But they, they work great

108
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,080
Speaker 5:  and you can name your timers now. Oh wow. Which is yeah very

109
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,800
Speaker 5:  handy. You can even dismiss a timer from one room if

110
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,840
Speaker 5:  the home pod is in the another room, which is nice. You don't have to yell.

111
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,280
Speaker 5:  There's a lot of little things like that that just kind of little quality

112
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,000
Speaker 5:  of life features, smart home features that have come to the new HomePod

113
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,880
Speaker 5:  and to the HomePod Mini and you know, you can, one thing I really like,

114
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,840
Speaker 5:  which is unique to the HomePod is the fine

115
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,760
Speaker 5:  my capability. So you can now track your family

116
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,520
Speaker 5:  just with your voice. You know, where's my child,

117
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,360
Speaker 5:  where's my husband? You know, don't have to get your phone out and like put

118
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,680
Speaker 5:  effort

119
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,400
Speaker 4:  In you. That's the next great Apple commercial is just someone screaming,

120
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,760
Speaker 4:  where's my husband and a speaker lighting up

121
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,880
Speaker 2:  And saying the answer. He's outside.

122
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,600
Speaker 4:  Do you ever think about the people who spend their lives like laying

123
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,360
Speaker 4:  underground under ocean fiber optic cables on

124
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,480
Speaker 4:  ships or the engineers who spend their entire lives

125
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,320
Speaker 4:  developing the next process technology for like a microchip

126
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,360
Speaker 4:  like the S seven? Yeah. And like one day they wake up and they're like, it's

127
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,640
Speaker 4:  all in service of people being able to set two timers at once and that's

128
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,880
Speaker 4:  what we're gonna be excited about tomorrow.

129
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,040
Speaker 5:  It's exciting.

130
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,000
Speaker 4:  Siri in particular, every time it comes up I'm like this is all we get, like

131
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,680
Speaker 4:  all

132
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,200
Speaker 5:  This work. Two

133
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,840
Speaker 4:  Timers and it's like you can name one timer and you can scream where's my

134
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,360
Speaker 4:  husband? And that is the pinnacle of of assistant technology.

135
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,080
Speaker 4:  You

136
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,560
Speaker 5:  Can do lots of timers. Actually I did up to five at once, which is quite

137
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,760
Speaker 5:  exciting. Oh my

138
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,680
Speaker 4:  God. See take that cruise ship people so much

139
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,480
Speaker 4:  re nihilism.

140
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,280
Speaker 5:  Well and we do also have the temperature and

141
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,440
Speaker 5:  humidity sensing, which we've actually written about quite a lot on the site

142
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,200
Speaker 5:  this week. But that's, that's gonna be in the, the home pod too and

143
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,880
Speaker 5:  I've been finding that really kind of fun cuz it's cold right now in

144
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,840
Speaker 5:  South Carolina, which is very unusual. So I've been using it

145
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,720
Speaker 5:  to keep my rooms temperate and it's worked really well. Although I

146
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,440
Speaker 5:  was talking with deputy editor Dan who is also a big HomePod

147
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,720
Speaker 5:  Apple home user and he's been trying to set up the humidity

148
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,680
Speaker 5:  sensor to do things which I don't really need to do in South Carolina cuz

149
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,520
Speaker 5:  South Carolina is humidity personified

150
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,400
Speaker 5:  and he's not been having any luck with that. So there's still a bit of testing

151
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,680
Speaker 5:  we need to do to sort of, you know, put that through its paces. We've only

152
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,560
Speaker 5:  only had these Diddy little devices for a few days now I'm

153
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,440
Speaker 5:  holding mine up. It's actually quite hefty. You could do good arm workouts.

154
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,960
Speaker 2:  Is that what you've been doing Chris? You've got two of 'em so you can do

155
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,880
Speaker 2:  both arms at the same time.

156
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,560
Speaker 4:  Yes. Just mention those every night. It's like the, you know the rock curls

157
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,680
Speaker 4:  as children. I have ever seen that. It's very funny. HomePod curls. Jen,

158
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,440
Speaker 4:  can I ask you this question? It seems like there's the updates to Apple

159
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,320
Speaker 4:  Home and sort of matter coming along for the ride. Yeah,

160
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,840
Speaker 4:  so the Apple home and home kit ecosystem is getting a big upgrade

161
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,720
Speaker 4:  and there was a software update to existing home pods and

162
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,360
Speaker 4:  HomePod. Many that sort of exposed these sensors added more

163
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,040
Speaker 4:  capabilities what is required in that

164
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,920
Speaker 4:  suite of new features to get a new HomePod for cause I think the

165
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,440
Speaker 4:  line for me is really blurry. It doesn't seem like the hardware of the new

166
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,320
Speaker 4:  HomePod is required for a lot of the new features of

167
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,320
Speaker 4:  Apple Home that are coming out now.

168
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,560
Speaker 5:  So you in terms of matter, you don't need a new HomePod

169
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,520
Speaker 5:  for matter. In fact the original HomePod will be a matter controller.

170
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,360
Speaker 5:  It will not be a thread border router though it doesn't have a thread radio

171
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,280
Speaker 5:  in. And that is something you might want with matter

172
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,000
Speaker 5:  because a lot of, or some new devices are coming out that use

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,840
Speaker 5:  thread and Apple Home is kind of leaning more on thread as

174
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,120
Speaker 5:  opposed to Bluetooth. Yeah for a lot of its connectivity, which is a good

175
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,080
Speaker 5:  move cuz Bluetooth in the smart home has never been a, a great experience.

176
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:07,600
Speaker 5:  We

177
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,160
Speaker 4:  Know Bluetooth is just a hot mess next year. All right,

178
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,920
Speaker 4:  next year.

179
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,760
Speaker 5:  So I, you know, I definitely see Apple Home moving away from reliance

180
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,600
Speaker 5:  on Bluetooth and Thread is really where they're putting their, the eggs in

181
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,240
Speaker 5:  the basket and thread is still kind of a nascent technology. It's,

182
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,600
Speaker 5:  it's been around for almost a decade but this, the infrastructure is still

183
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,920
Speaker 5:  not quite there to support a strong thread network.

184
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,960
Speaker 5:  I've been talking to a different number of different companies who are all

185
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,520
Speaker 5:  producing thread border routers, which is part of matter. They're two

186
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,040
Speaker 5:  distinct technologies that work hand in hand matter and thread. And the problem

187
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,680
Speaker 5:  is right now if you have like a Google Home Thread border router, which

188
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,480
Speaker 5:  it's the Nest hub, max is one and you also have say an Echo

189
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,360
Speaker 5:  fourth gen which is gonna be a border router in the next few months,

190
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,520
Speaker 5:  they'll all create their own separate oh no thread networks which kind of

191
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,360
Speaker 5:  defeats the purpose of thread. So we are waiting, everyone

192
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,320
Speaker 5:  promises me that this is all gonna be fixed soon and eventually all

193
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,840
Speaker 5:  of these devices will work together in sort of harmony in your home, which

194
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,800
Speaker 5:  is, you know, the promise of matter. So I would recommend if

195
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,760
Speaker 5:  you are on fence and you don't have a home pod or an Apple TV that supports

196
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,160
Speaker 5:  thread and you're looking at buying one, it's worth having a device with

197
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,880
Speaker 5:  a thread boarder outer if you want to work in the smart home because it,

198
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,640
Speaker 5:  it will it's future proof in your smart home but you don't need

199
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,520
Speaker 5:  one necessarily today. So it's interesting cuz Apple came out with two new

200
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,760
Speaker 5:  Apple TVs and didn't put thread in one of them but did in the other.

201
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,120
Speaker 5:  So I mean maybe, I don't know they're hedging their bets there a little too

202
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,920
Speaker 5:  but it does, it is an important step for matter

203
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,120
Speaker 5:  which Apple has been fully kind of on board with

204
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,480
Speaker 5:  since the beginning cuz it actually sort of started matter one of the, it

205
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,880
Speaker 5:  was one of the founding companies and it has you know, contributed

206
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,680
Speaker 5:  home kit to the infrastructure of matter. There's a lot of

207
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,160
Speaker 5:  similarities between Apple home using Apple Home and using matter

208
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,600
Speaker 5:  devices. The problem right now is there are just not very many matter devices

209
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,360
Speaker 5:  to use and they sent us, apple sent us a matter, an

210
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,400
Speaker 5:  eve matter device to use with the HomePod which is great.

211
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,200
Speaker 4:  This had a light switch? A plug?

212
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,640
Speaker 5:  The plug, yes. Okay. The Eve energy plug and I'd already used,

213
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,360
Speaker 5:  I'd already been using a matter Eve energy plug that I'd upgraded myself

214
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,480
Speaker 5:  but there's just not enough devices out there yet to really get a feel of

215
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,240
Speaker 5:  how this is all gonna work. The momentum is there though and I would, you

216
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,160
Speaker 5:  know, I'm definitely gonna sort of check in in a a few months time and see

217
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,880
Speaker 5:  if the thread solution, the thread situation has

218
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,680
Speaker 5:  resolved itself and you know whether these devices are actually

219
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,080
Speaker 5:  creating a stronger, more robust network in your home or

220
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,120
Speaker 5:  if they're all still competing with each other and and causing issues, which

221
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,560
Speaker 5:  unfortunately is one of the problems at the moment. So

222
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,280
Speaker 4:  The, the dumb question here is if you have an existing home pod and you're

223
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,160
Speaker 4:  happy with it, your reasons to upgrade from a smart home perspective are

224
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,320
Speaker 4:  kind of zero, right? It's like you want thread but there's not enough reason

225
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,080
Speaker 4:  to have thread yet and if you have a new Apple TV or you have a home pod

226
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,920
Speaker 4:  mini or they actually get together and work together, you have hero routers

227
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,760
Speaker 4:  or an echo like that stuff will serve the purpose.

228
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,800
Speaker 5:  Correct. There's no major benefit to having multiple fed border

229
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,760
Speaker 5:  routers. You can do it and it will help extend your network, your mesh

230
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,360
Speaker 5:  network, but only if you live in a reasonable sized home you're not gonna

231
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,840
Speaker 5:  need multiple border routers. Yeah. So yes, if you have an original home

232
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,720
Speaker 5:  pot and you're happy with it, it's fast enough for you and it responds well

233
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,560
Speaker 5:  enough for you then you know you can get thread for less than

234
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,240
Speaker 5:  $300 quite easily by adding HomePod mini or an Apple TV

235
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,000
Speaker 5:  or as you said a border router from a, from a different company. Cuz

236
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,960
Speaker 2:  The new one's faster,

237
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:46,000
Speaker 5:  The new one is faster. Yes, that's been my experience from the smart home

238
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,760
Speaker 5:  side. Like I put a HomePod two and a mini together and asked

239
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,440
Speaker 5:  my questions and the HomePod two always got, got there first,

240
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,160
Speaker 5:  grab the glory and ran with it and responded quickly that like I said,

241
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,120
Speaker 5:  much less sort of, I mean an RN and kind of waiting, spinning its

242
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,040
Speaker 5:  wheels. There was a much fast response. I am actually on the new

243
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,000
Speaker 5:  Apple Home architecture, which I think is not actually to do with

244
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,960
Speaker 5:  matter but it's sort of like in preparation for matter and that is

245
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,880
Speaker 5:  something that they pulled, apple had a lot of issues

246
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,640
Speaker 5:  when it first rolled out but if you did get it when it first rolled out and

247
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,240
Speaker 5:  it worked for you, it's still working And I found

248
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,720
Speaker 5:  that it has been a lot more stable and a lot more reliable. So

249
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,840
Speaker 5:  the improvement in the HomePod two could also be down to

250
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,680
Speaker 5:  the improvement in the home architecture. I don't have an original HomePod

251
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,560
Speaker 5:  here to kind of compare but, but my mini is

252
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,720
Speaker 5:  not as fast so

253
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,240
Speaker 2:  It's probably probably gonna generally be faster. Chris, does it

254
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,920
Speaker 2:  sound better?

255
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,600
Speaker 6:  It sounds very similar to the first HomePod. Very similar and not the same.

256
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,640
Speaker 6:  Like if you, you put them side by side you can tell some differences. Yeah.

257
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,680
Speaker 6:  But sometimes the new one sounds clearer and better and sometimes the old

258
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,560
Speaker 6:  one sounds a bit more detailed, like all comes down to what song you're playing.

259
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,960
Speaker 6:  But on the whole it's very, very similar.

260
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,960
Speaker 4:  They cut down the number of tweeters right?

261
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,000
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There are five now as opposed to seven last time and there are four

262
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,960
Speaker 6:  mics instead of six. There's also a new system sensor is

263
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,800
Speaker 6:  what it's called, which is the most vague thing I've ever heard in my life

264
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,800
Speaker 6:  that's supposed to like help with all like the computational tuning even

265
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,120
Speaker 6:  better than it was last time. So on the whole those things should hopefully

266
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,000
Speaker 6:  balance out for like a very similar overall sound, which it is. So if you

267
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,200
Speaker 6:  like the first one you like this one, if you didn't like the first one, you're

268
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,600
Speaker 6:  probably not gonna love this one either. So

269
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,320
Speaker 2:  You're not gonna sit there, you never like we're listening to stuff on the

270
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,040
Speaker 2:  new one and being like man I just missed those seven tweeters.

271
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,000
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Not myself but I'm sure there will be like a small group of people

272
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,080
Speaker 6:  who swear that they ruined it and that the first HomePod was like a really

273
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,760
Speaker 6:  special product.

274
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,000
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah, the stereo form people are about to, I mean this is, this

275
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,200
Speaker 4:  is the greatest gift they've ever been given is arguing with the number of

276
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,120
Speaker 4:  tweeters in the HomePod. So the, the first one when I reviewed it a

277
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,680
Speaker 4:  long time ago, there was a lot of apple like made a lot of noise

278
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,120
Speaker 4:  about computational audio using the

279
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,880
Speaker 4:  tweeters. They, you know, they have a sensor in the body

280
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,800
Speaker 4:  of the HomePod to measure the distance the woofer is going right.

281
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,400
Speaker 4:  They were bouncing some sound off the walls and measuring that in real time.

282
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,360
Speaker 4:  If you moved it they would remeasure it. Oh very cool. I was never like,

283
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,680
Speaker 4:  oh this is the greatest sounding speaker in history. Which is kind of where

284
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,240
Speaker 4:  Apple like led people to believe like their version

285
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,080
Speaker 4:  of computational audio would dramatically blow away speakers

286
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,520
Speaker 4:  costing tens of thousands of dollars and at the end of the day it's like

287
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,400
Speaker 4:  it's limited by its size, right? It's like it's this big and it can

288
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,200
Speaker 4:  do this much and like it sounds very good and the

289
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,120
Speaker 4:  Sonos one sounds pretty good too. And the Sonos five sounds

290
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,040
Speaker 4:  a little bit better and it has bigger low end drivers so

291
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,440
Speaker 4:  it can make more base, right? Like it's just very much they overhyped it

292
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,360
Speaker 4:  because I think Siri was bad so their solution to marketing it was like

293
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,240
Speaker 4:  it's the best sounding speaker in the world. Are they doing that again this

294
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,080
Speaker 4:  time or are they just kind of like here's you love the HomePod mini

295
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,160
Speaker 4:  now it's bigger,

296
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,320
Speaker 6:  There was less talk of all that stuff but it is still the same as far as

297
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,160
Speaker 6:  like the room Yeah stuff goes and all that background process goes.

298
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,640
Speaker 6:  But yeah, I mean the review that like the sound is very clear,

299
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,560
Speaker 6:  super detailed, rich, whatever, but there's no warmth to the HomePod sound

300
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,840
Speaker 6:  or as like Sonos does have some of that and some other speakers do. This

301
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,800
Speaker 6:  is very like this is what the lab told us a speaker should sound like.

302
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,440
Speaker 2:  Oh that's interesting though cuz I remember the one

303
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,920
Speaker 2:  HomePod having a much warmer sound than the Sonos one

304
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,600
Speaker 6:  Sometimes I guess certain tracks again it comes down to again but on the

305
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,200
Speaker 6:  whole it's just very clear to me like that's the one thing that I always

306
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,960
Speaker 6:  like vocals are right there in the center. It sounds good. I think two is

307
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,400
Speaker 6:  where it really starts to like sound really, really good but that's

308
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,240
Speaker 6:  $600 so at that point you are looking at a Sonos five

309
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,160
Speaker 6:  or whatever else too.

310
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,080
Speaker 4:  You will get more serious separation from two obviously.

311
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,760
Speaker 6:  Yeah so two together and that's where the spatial audio thing a case can

312
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Speaker 6:  be be made that when you have two very nice speakers

313
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,200
Speaker 6:  beaming sound all over the room, that spatial audio does start to make a

314
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,800
Speaker 6:  bit more sense and sounds pretty good for like the very good master tracks.

315
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,640
Speaker 2:  Okay. It started to make sense. Did it actually like were you like okay I

316
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,760
Speaker 2:  get spatial audio now

317
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,000
Speaker 6:  For a few songs. Yeah but there are still so many that are bad that still

318
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,840
Speaker 6:  don't sound, don't sound as good as their stereo versions. But yeah there

319
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,560
Speaker 6:  are certainly some tracks where there's just like a more atmosphere and you

320
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,200
Speaker 6:  can hear instruments throughout the room and it's a bit more than stereo

321
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,600
Speaker 6:  itself. So it's there certainly more than headphones and earbuds where it's

322
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,640
Speaker 6:  still just very

323
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,520
Speaker 4:  Silly. My new go-to rules, it only sounds good if the music

324
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,440
Speaker 4:  was meant to be listened to on drugs. And so like music for being

325
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,280
Speaker 4:  on drugs that's like great and then everything else and we've got notes

326
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,160
Speaker 4:  about this PE people like it but everything else just kinda like loses impact.

327
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,560
Speaker 4:  And I think where Apple could succeed here is by getting away from

328
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,080
Speaker 4:  spatial audio for music which they are just relentlessly

329
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,840
Speaker 4:  promoting to to no discernible effect and focusing on the

330
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,960
Speaker 4:  TV features they've added to the HomePod, right? And saying okay you can

331
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,720
Speaker 4:  get two home pods together. They've added this new feature where you can

332
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,280
Speaker 4:  do er off of TV so you can send all the audio from your TV to your home pods.

333
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,960
Speaker 2:  Can we talk about that?

334
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,120
Speaker 4:  Well Chris explained that but then you get, you, do you get Atmos when you

335
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,960
Speaker 4:  do that? Like proper movie atmos?

336
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,040
Speaker 6:  I think it mixes down Atmos. Like there are no like up firing speakers obviously

337
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,160
Speaker 6:  in the HomePod. Yeah but it sounds pretty good. Yeah, so that feature's been

338
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,640
Speaker 6:  around, I guess they've called it beta to like last week when they actually

339
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,400
Speaker 6:  put out TV OS 16.3 or whatever it was. And so now it's like a full on

340
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,120
Speaker 6:  feature and so you can plug the Apple TV 4k, you need the new one that goes

341
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,920
Speaker 6:  into your TV's ER port and then the home pods will play all of your TV's

342
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,720
Speaker 6:  audio. So like I was playing a PS five game and there was like no latency,

343
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,760
Speaker 6:  no audio sync issues. I was like this is not supposed to work this well.

344
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,520
Speaker 6:  This is er, it's supposed to be a Hellscape,

345
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,840
Speaker 4:  It's htm I, yeah like none of this is supposed to work right, this public

346
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,360
Speaker 4:  service. What TV do you have that you are using this with?

347
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,200
Speaker 6:  I've got the hiene E eight H myself and I have very good wifi so I'm sure

348
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Speaker 6:  that that plays into it too. There, there are many factors that could make

349
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,680
Speaker 6:  this worse for you but it does work. And so that by itself has me convinced

350
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,880
Speaker 6:  that Apple has more home theater stuff coming down the pipeline cuz like

351
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,320
Speaker 6:  why would you go through all that work just for the HomePod,

352
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,320
Speaker 4:  You know? Well I remember the number one thing when I did the review of the

353
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,880
Speaker 4:  first one, the number one question people asked was can I use it with my

354
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,400
Speaker 4:  Apple TV all the time? And so I think just from a, you know, not Apple doesn't

355
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Speaker 4:  do like proper focus groups so just from like a market research perspective

356
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,080
Speaker 4:  they're like what would make the HomePod better? And they're like, I wanna

357
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,160
Speaker 4:  use it for my tv. It's like you would build it, they built it, you know,

358
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,880
Speaker 4:  I think I would put this in the same category of like, it doesn't detect

359
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,760
Speaker 4:  a fire but it can listen for a smoke alarm. It's like a Rube

360
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,280
Speaker 4:  Goldberg machine to get what you want out of the HomePod, right? It's like

361
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,880
Speaker 4:  you need an Apple TV and you er into the Apple TV and that wireless is sends

362
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,720
Speaker 4:  to the HomePod and we don't actually detect a fire but we'll listen for a

363
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,440
Speaker 4:  a smoke like it gets to the right outcome, which is your phone

364
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,200
Speaker 4:  beeps if there's a fire and the TV audio is coming outta the speaker. It's

365
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,000
Speaker 4:  just a winding path to get there that is kind of like distinctly on Apple.

366
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,200
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it seems strange to leave your Apple TV on at all times for, for that

367
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,240
Speaker 6:  feature too. But it sounds better than like a Sonos Ray soundbar, like the

368
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,120
Speaker 6:  two of them together really The base those woofer are Yeah those are legit

369
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,840
Speaker 6:  wolfers. So like if you don't have like a subwoofer for your Sonos or any

370
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,280
Speaker 6:  kind of like budget level soundbar, this is gonna sound much better than

371
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,880
Speaker 6:  that. But again, you've gotta leave your Apple T on all the time, which I'm

372
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,880
Speaker 6:  sure some people do like that's their mainstreaming device and that's fine.

373
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,760
Speaker 2:  It's kind of in a weird place financially though because a beam is like

374
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,600
Speaker 2:  $300 and this is

375
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,800
Speaker 6:  $600.

376
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,920
Speaker 2:  Yes $600 and then an arc is what, $200 more

377
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,480
Speaker 2:  than that? Yeah. And that'll give you true atmos and

378
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,080
Speaker 2:  and everything. So it's like I don't really know if the people who are buying

379
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,360
Speaker 2:  a Sonos are like, do I wanna go into this weird middle ground

380
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,320
Speaker 2:  necessarily with two home pods?

381
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,960
Speaker 6:  Right? Yeah. That's for people who just like live like all in Apples world,

382
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Speaker 6:  thoroughly in the ecosystem, don't want to go anywhere else and they're happy

383
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,120
Speaker 6:  there. Yeah.

384
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,040
Speaker 4:  If you're like an exceedingly well groomed person

385
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,880
Speaker 4:  who wears all black Yeah and you live alone and you

386
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,000
Speaker 4:  don't allow strangers into your house and all the magazines are perfectly

387
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,920
Speaker 4:  arranged, this is gonna be great for you. Yeah. And all of your

388
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,360
Speaker 4:  furniture's made out concrete, you know, like I'm describing like my idealized

389
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,040
Speaker 4:  lifestyle, like let's be, I'm not trying to talk down to be like if I was

390
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,000
Speaker 4:  very single, like I'd be like yes, all my furniture's made out of concrete

391
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,440
Speaker 4:  and you're not allow my home and all I have is home pods The wire

392
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,200
Speaker 4:  perfectly routed so you don't see it. But like in reality

393
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,360
Speaker 4:  that's like not how it works for most people.

394
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,120
Speaker 5:  Well you can remove the wire now. Yeah, exactly. Now that you can remove

395
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,800
Speaker 5:  the wire. I know we're gonna see third party battery mounts for this thing.

396
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,640
Speaker 4:  Oh my god.

397
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,440
Speaker 5:  There's, there's still a lot of question like why bring it back? Okay.

398
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,520
Speaker 5:  And I'm biased because I'm coming from the smart home side, but I think honestly

399
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,360
Speaker 5:  it all ties in with matter and thread because the

400
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,080
Speaker 5:  original home pod was discontinued just after they started Matter

401
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,120
Speaker 5:  and I think Apple realized that this was not gonna be capable

402
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,800
Speaker 5:  of supporting this new smart home platform. And the biggest

403
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,440
Speaker 5:  change really in, in this device I from the

404
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,560
Speaker 5:  original is the support for Thread and it has

405
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,480
Speaker 5:  matter which you can have in both, but this is now their flagship

406
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,400
Speaker 5:  smart home controller for matter. And the people

407
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,920
Speaker 5:  were sad it was gone, they wanted it back, it wasn't as successful as perhaps

408
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,680
Speaker 5:  people expected, but there's a passionate user base behind this,

409
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,560
Speaker 5:  this device, the original version and I'm sure there will be with the new

410
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,000
Speaker 5:  version and it it, it fits perfectly into the lineup

411
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,240
Speaker 5:  but it's not what they really needed to do. What they really need to do

412
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,200
Speaker 5:  is bring us a smart home controller that we can actually use to control our

413
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,240
Speaker 5:  smart home that has a touch interface and that works

414
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,560
Speaker 5:  with multiple people because right now Apple just

415
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,320
Speaker 5:  sucks at that. Yeah. I really struggled. I could

416
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,280
Speaker 5:  not get personal requests to work for all of my family with the

417
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,200
Speaker 5:  new home pod or the old home pod.

418
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,720
Speaker 2:  Just your your husband and you were the only ones that worked

419
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,280
Speaker 5:  For only my husband. I would work soon as I had my kids. It just went crazy.

420
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:42,720
Speaker 5:  Did

421
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,440
Speaker 2:  It? Was it just like they do not like pay the

422
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,840
Speaker 2:  mortgage so they do not get a say,

423
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,520
Speaker 5:  I dunno what it was. I've been talking to Apple, they've been troubleshooting

424
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,200
Speaker 5:  but we haven't found a solution. But every time I added either of my children,

425
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,480
Speaker 5:  one of whom is over 14 and one of whom is under, cuz that's a, a cutoff point

426
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,400
Speaker 5:  with family sharing, it would just stop recognizing anyone's

427
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,360
Speaker 5:  voice. And the personal request side is a real challenge

428
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,120
Speaker 5:  in the smart home. None of the other platforms have actually nailed it very

429
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,160
Speaker 5:  well either. I I struggle with both Google Home and

430
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,200
Speaker 5:  Amazon's Alexis ecosystem for them to recognize personal

431
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,080
Speaker 5:  requests. It's, it's a hard, it's a hard problem but it's one that really

432
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,760
Speaker 5:  needs to be solved because the smart home is not about the single guy in

433
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,800
Speaker 5:  the concrete house. It's about multi-user

434
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,120
Speaker 5:  homes and, and places where, you know, you've got roommates, there's

435
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,800
Speaker 5:  very few people that live alone and that are gonna have a, a vast or

436
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,760
Speaker 5:  a comprehensive smart home ecosystem because, and that's something that all

437
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,440
Speaker 5:  these solutions need to work on and hopefully,

438
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,520
Speaker 5:  I mean Apples has been the most useful to date because of the

439
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,880
Speaker 5:  tight integration with the phone. But obviously if not everyone in your home

440
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,840
Speaker 5:  uses iPhones or iOS devices, then it's, it's just not

441
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,800
Speaker 5:  useful. And as much as matter is helping bring down those ward

442
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,080
Speaker 5:  gardens for the smart home, apple is still

443
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,760
Speaker 5:  very much a curated garden party.

444
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,200
Speaker 4:  Well so, so the the the matter piece for Apple is really interesting. They're,

445
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,840
Speaker 4:  they're very much behind it. They did give up a bunch of home kit or share

446
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,680
Speaker 4:  it with the, the Matter consortium to build off of it and that's because

447
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,800
Speaker 4:  the other smart home ecosystems were ahead, right? Alexa

448
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:28,240
Speaker 4:  notably is, is much more ahead, many more devices work

449
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,720
Speaker 4:  with Alexa, you get everybody to support Matter. All those devices work with

450
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,680
Speaker 4:  Home Kit as well. You can control them from your phone. That's great for

451
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,640
Speaker 4:  Apple but isn't the flip side of it that the Alexa, you know,

452
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,480
Speaker 4:  in Echo show can also control your, your smart plugs just

453
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,680
Speaker 4:  as well as home kit on your phone?

454
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,400
Speaker 5:  Well that's the, that's the key phrase just as well

455
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,040
Speaker 5:  will it, I mean because Matter is giving that

456
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,840
Speaker 5:  common infrastructure so that everyone can control the same devices

457
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,840
Speaker 5:  but you still have to have the, the good user experience on top.

458
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,040
Speaker 5:  And as I've talked about before in articles, it, the Home

459
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,560
Speaker 5:  pod and the Apple Home ecosystem is one of the better user

460
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,240
Speaker 5:  experiences. The Alexa experience, the Amazon experience is

461
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,120
Speaker 5:  still, it's, it's so big and it does, it can do so many things

462
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,960
Speaker 5:  that it's also really hard to kind of keep track of

463
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,600
Speaker 5:  and remember exactly what what you want it to do. And you might ask it to

464
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,800
Speaker 5:  turn on a light and it will go and buy you some toilet paper. You know, there,

465
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,760
Speaker 5:  there is too much going on. Whereas the Siri ecosystem and

466
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,240
Speaker 5:  Apple Home is a lot more tightly controlled. So if you're using matter

467
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,840
Speaker 5:  devices in either platform, you're gonna have different experiences

468
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,680
Speaker 5:  because of the experience that each platform adds. And that's

469
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,640
Speaker 5:  where the, they're gonna differentiate is by, you know, with Apple Home

470
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,400
Speaker 5:  you can use adaptive lighting and that's not part of a matter yet, but

471
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,920
Speaker 5:  hopefully it will come so that, you know, you don't just have to buy the

472
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,840
Speaker 5:  expensive light bulbs to get that expensive feeling feature where the

473
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,800
Speaker 5:  lights change naturally during the day with sunlight you'll

474
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,640
Speaker 5:  be able to use any matter enabled light bulb and you know, have that

475
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,520
Speaker 5:  feature that you can use through Apple Home. Amazon Alexa

476
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Speaker 5:  doesn't offer that feature yet. So you know, there's gonna be things like

477
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,680
Speaker 5:  that that make the difference that that make you choose one platform over

478
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,000
Speaker 5:  the other.

479
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,560
Speaker 6:  I think this product was just, just like so easy for them. It's like such

480
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,960
Speaker 6:  an easy lift like so they call this the all new HomePod and that's just the

481
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,480
Speaker 6:  funniest thing I've ever heard in my life. Cause it's like the same design

482
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,640
Speaker 6:  and it's like here's your new speaker. It's very similar and so they just

483
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,440
Speaker 6:  like bought themselves probably two years to build something new that's actually

484
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,480
Speaker 6:  gonna like be that new thing for the home.

485
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,320
Speaker 4:  Well so you were talking about what they should build, right? Which is like

486
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,200
Speaker 4:  a tablet with a touch screen that you can actually click the buttons on,

487
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,080
Speaker 4:  like put put an iPad on a stand. That's what Google is doing with the

488
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,880
Speaker 4:  next version of the Nest. We don't know when it's gonna come but they showed

489
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,960
Speaker 4:  one. I'm wondering on a more conceptual level

490
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,280
Speaker 4:  home kit in particular doesn't live anywhere that a

491
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,240
Speaker 4:  user understands, right? You buy an Echo and

492
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,480
Speaker 4:  it's like now I'm in control of your smart home and you're like, okay this

493
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,400
Speaker 4:  computer is the one that's in charge of my smart home and that's not

494
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,360
Speaker 4:  exactly right. There's a lot of cloud services and all this other stuff going

495
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,000
Speaker 4:  on, but like you're like this is the thing that controls my House Home Kit

496
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,800
Speaker 4:  lives on an Apple tv, it lives on an

497
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,720
Speaker 4:  iPad until recently it could live on this thing. Like a lot you can solve

498
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,600
Speaker 4:  a lot of home kit problems by just like rebooting your Apple tv which

499
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,680
Speaker 5:  Or your iPhone. Yeah.

500
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,320
Speaker 4:  Or your iPhone and it's like the lights aren't working. I needed to turn

501
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,200
Speaker 4:  off my phone. Like I say this stuff out loud to people and I I know I just

502
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,080
Speaker 4:  sound like a maniac.

503
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,320
Speaker 5:  That's so true.

504
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,000
Speaker 4:  Does this solve that problem? It's like all right, I'm just gonna reboot

505
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,160
Speaker 4:  the HomePod and that'll fix it.

506
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So it, that has been the go-to solution for any

507
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,720
Speaker 5:  issue with home kit, your phone and your whichever

508
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,560
Speaker 5:  home hub you have and with Alexa in particular and a lot of Google

509
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,080
Speaker 5:  Home there's much more reliance on the cloud but the

510
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,880
Speaker 5:  intricacies of how the Apple TV and the HomePod and the

511
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,440
Speaker 5:  phone and all work together have very much been kind of a black box.

512
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,480
Speaker 5:  We just know that rebooting the phone works, who

513
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,400
Speaker 5:  knows why Apple has said, I think that the new home architecture is gonna

514
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,120
Speaker 5:  kind of make some of that a little clearer but that hasn't

515
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,640
Speaker 5:  officially arrived yet. So we, we still don't really understand the difference.

516
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,040
Speaker 5:  I did notice in my testing since I've been on the new home architecture

517
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:20,240
Speaker 5:  that it does stick with one home hub rather than bouncing

518
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,880
Speaker 5:  around like it used to love going to my HomePod minis, which I would

519
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,040
Speaker 5:  constantly unplug for various reasons and would mess everything up. Now it

520
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,640
Speaker 5:  just sticks with my Apple TV that's hardwired and it's like hallelujah, this

521
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,200
Speaker 5:  makes sense, this is what we should have done since the beginning. Do you

522
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,680
Speaker 5:  get to choose that? No. No you still can't choose it

523
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,720
Speaker 5:  but it just seems to be more rational than it used to be before.

524
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,120
Speaker 5:  And it did try and use the HomePod, the new HomePod a couple times but then

525
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,880
Speaker 5:  it was like eh went back to the Apple tv. So and that's something

526
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,360
Speaker 5:  about the smart home in general that I think confuses people and what is

527
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,600
Speaker 5:  gonna help with matter because we're gonna bring almost

528
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:02,800
Speaker 5:  most devices and most interactions that you need to be

529
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,440
Speaker 5:  quick and happen on a regular basis into your home and local

530
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,120
Speaker 5:  without having to use the cloud because that's where, you know, when people

531
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,040
Speaker 5:  get frustrated with Siri, I think we talked about this on our last episode

532
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,160
Speaker 5:  together Alex, you know, because she's, it is waiting or it's, it

533
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,600
Speaker 5:  can't connect to the internet or it can't get some device to work. Yeah it's

534
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,480
Speaker 5:  normally something is broken in a cloud connection or some kind of wifi

535
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,720
Speaker 5:  connection. Whereas once we have this more robust

536
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,320
Speaker 5:  infrastructure for the smart home, those kind of issues won't, won't happen

537
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,960
Speaker 5:  so much hopefully and it'll be a much smoother experience, you know,

538
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,480
Speaker 5:  just as easy as actually turning the light switch on

539
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,080
Speaker 4:  The ever elusive goal. It's so funny because I still have my little

540
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,720
Speaker 4:  HomeBridge tamagotchi in the garage that I have to go and like reboot and

541
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,960
Speaker 4:  open up to take the SD card out and like reformat it every few

542
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,280
Speaker 4:  months and I'm like, this is better. Like this is like

543
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,760
Speaker 4:  concentrated effort into chaos like every three months I started all over

544
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,400
Speaker 4:  and then it's fine for three months as opposed to you know like

545
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,240
Speaker 4:  matter which is one day I'm sure just like Bluetooth it'll be better.

546
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,720
Speaker 4:  But right now it's like a lot of like diffuse effort to even

547
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,840
Speaker 4:  know what the hell is going on.

548
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,320
Speaker 5:  I think the good thing though, the thing that I'm most excited about with

549
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,160
Speaker 5:  Matter and Thread is that you won't need a tamagotchi, you won't

550
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,600
Speaker 5:  need a single device that runs everything because when you have a single

551
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,760
Speaker 5:  device that runs everything, you have a single point of failure and that's

552
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,640
Speaker 5:  when things go belly up. And you know, with thread in particular

553
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,480
Speaker 5:  and with Apple and most of the ecosystems putting matter and

554
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,400
Speaker 5:  thread into every device, most people these days with smart

555
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,160
Speaker 5:  homes have more than one smart speaker. So you're gonna have these multiple

556
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,760
Speaker 5:  points that can keep your smart home running if you know,

557
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,720
Speaker 5:  because someone unplugged your Echo speaker to use their hair

558
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,560
Speaker 5:  dryer and you didn't realize and now nothing's working in your home anymore,

559
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,040
Speaker 5:  you know that that won't happen anymore. And that's one of the reasons I

560
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,120
Speaker 5:  think that thread B got chosen over ZigBee because in

561
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,840
Speaker 5:  previously and when you use ZigBee, if you're familiar with, you know like

562
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,360
Speaker 5:  Phillips Hugh runs on a ZigBee bridge and you know, one morning I might wake

563
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,880
Speaker 5:  up and I'm like why are none of my lights turning on? And I realize it's

564
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,040
Speaker 5:  because someone unplugged my hub bridge for some reason. But nothing, you

565
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,480
Speaker 5:  know, it's, you're gonna lose that single point of failure and

566
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,040
Speaker 5:  the smart home is gonna become much more kind of diffuse

567
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,680
Speaker 5:  and more integrated into your home rather than just relying on little white

568
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,040
Speaker 5:  boxes or or Tamagotchis in the garage.

569
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,960
Speaker 4:  No, but Jen, here's my solution though. Everything is routed through my HomeBridge

570
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,840
Speaker 4:  Tamagotchi but then independently of that, that is plugged into a

571
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,120
Speaker 4:  smart plug that is on home kit natively. Oh my gosh. So when the home bridge

572
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,960
Speaker 4:  crashes I can just reboot people living. No that's my smart

573
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,000
Speaker 4:  plug. It's sounds like a genius

574
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,720
Speaker 5:  That works unless your WiFi's gone down.

575
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,800
Speaker 4:  That's true.

576
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,640
Speaker 5:  And then you're just outta luck.

577
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,360
Speaker 4:  This is also a great solution for troubleshooting anything at your parents'

578
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,680
Speaker 4:  house remotely is you get a smart plug on their network and then you just

579
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Speaker 4:  turn Yes. Not from your

580
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,640
Speaker 5:  As I, I spent like three hours on the phone with my dad the

581
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,400
Speaker 5:  other night because he couldn't figure out why when he reconnected his router

582
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,960
Speaker 5:  it wasn't working and he just put two cables the wrong way round and it's

583
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,720
Speaker 5:  like ugh. Yep this the smart home is doomed.

584
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,400
Speaker 2:  Well it we, we are gonna face like a challenge for the next couple of years

585
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,920
Speaker 2:  though, right? As everybody has cuz people still have to upgrade

586
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,960
Speaker 2:  everything that's never gonna support matter and they're still gonna have

587
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,600
Speaker 2:  to like wait for some companies Dyson's like yeah we're doing matter and

588
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,200
Speaker 2:  then crickets.

589
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,440
Speaker 5:  There's a lot of crickets. Yeah. Sonos crickets. Yeah.

590
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:34,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah though the good thing is that matter works with your existing

591
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,320
Speaker 5:  ecosystems, right? So if you are all in on Apple Home or all in on

592
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,080
Speaker 5:  Amazon or Google or smart things, you can start adding matter

593
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,600
Speaker 5:  devices now and they will work just like they do.

594
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,200
Speaker 5:  Like your system works today. So it's not like we are asking, you know, it's

595
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,040
Speaker 5:  not matter's not going to make everything have to start from scratch. It

596
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,800
Speaker 5:  is gonna be a slow process. It's, you know, like when they try and redo roads

597
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,040
Speaker 5:  or redo the plumbing, they're not gonna do it all at once because everything

598
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,000
Speaker 5:  would explode. You need, it's a slow process. So yes, I

599
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,800
Speaker 5:  think ultimately I'm gonna be doing this for a long time. It's gonna keep

600
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,280
Speaker 5:  me in a job.

601
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:12,800
Speaker 6:  Speaking of Sonos, I do kind of wonder, we did mention Sonos and I do

602
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Speaker 6:  kind of wonder if like six months down the line we're gonna wonder like did

603
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,520
Speaker 6:  Apple play it too safe with the home pot too? Cause like Sonos is gonna come

604
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,120
Speaker 6:  out with a brand new like holy designed speaker, like spatial audio. You

605
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,080
Speaker 6:  say, okay, here's like a 10 driver like speaker that's gonna have u

606
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,360
Speaker 6:  s BBC in and all sorts of crazy stuff. Yeah.

607
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,320
Speaker 2:  It, I'm just really hesitant to think of how many people who

608
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,200
Speaker 2:  can afford a home pod are also thinking like it's either that

609
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,920
Speaker 2:  or the Sonos. I would assume most of those people are usually like, it's

610
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,040
Speaker 2:  that and the Sonos.

611
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,920
Speaker 4:  I make this mistake too, I think, I always think the home pod is like, you

612
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,120
Speaker 4:  should get two of them. And so like I think it costs $600 but it costs

613
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,920
Speaker 4:  $300.

614
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,400
Speaker 2:  Cost 300.

615
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:53,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's, it's in a, a pretty reasonable range for a lot of

616
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,160
Speaker 4:  of people who are willing to spend money on smart light, light switches and

617
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,240
Speaker 4:  whatever. Like I think what Chris is getting at is Sonos is gonna offer you

618
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,840
Speaker 4:  more advanced technology than what Apple has. It might have even more

619
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,680
Speaker 4:  unnecessary audio processing and it will work with more things. For

620
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,360
Speaker 4:  example, a thing that the Sonos speaker will do is work with

621
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,680
Speaker 4:  Spotify,

622
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,400
Speaker 6:  Which is still not there as a default service, but I guess that's

623
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,080
Speaker 6:  Spotify's fault at this, at this point. Yeah,

624
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,040
Speaker 2:  But I I think like they're different products, right? Like one is

625
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,920
Speaker 2:  probably more intended for the home pod I see is more like,

626
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,360
Speaker 2:  oh I've got Sonos in my, my living room, that's my home theater.

627
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,640
Speaker 2:  I'm not gonna necessarily want to use Home Pods for that. The Home pod is

628
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,560
Speaker 2:  more like, I need to have music while I'm cooking dinner and I need to

629
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,200
Speaker 2:  be able to talk to it because one is talking and like Sonos is bad

630
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,320
Speaker 2:  at the assistant. Sonos is real, real bad. Oh yeah. Assistance. Yeah.

631
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:51,080
Speaker 2:  So I just don't like if you're getting it for the assistant, you don't need,

632
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,600
Speaker 2:  like, those are two different things.

633
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,640
Speaker 5:  It falls in a slightly odd spot because if you just need the, the

634
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,360
Speaker 5:  music while you're cooking dinner, then you've got the mini Yeah. If you

635
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,240
Speaker 5:  want more interaction, you want to follow a recipe in the kitchen, then

636
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,680
Speaker 5:  you're gonna go with like a show, an echo show or a a Nest hub, you know,

637
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,040
Speaker 5:  an iPad sitting next to a mini is just, just feels kind of wrong.

638
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,920
Speaker 5:  I just feel like it's, it is, as Chris said, it was an easy upgrade now,

639
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,800
Speaker 5:  but I don't think it's the grand plan for Apple Home going forward, right?

640
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:19,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

641
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I might, but I think I'm in a very small minority because we use

642
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,840
Speaker 4:  Google Assistant on our Sonos one and we use Google

643
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,640
Speaker 4:  Homes and their default audio devices

644
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,120
Speaker 4:  set to Sonos speakers and the various streams they're in

645
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,360
Speaker 4:  and these companies are suing each other and they hate each other and everyone

646
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,640
Speaker 4:  says it's not supposed to work.

647
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,720
Speaker 5:  I was gonna say, how did you get that to work?

648
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,840
Speaker 4:  I think it's because I cover the lawsuit that they're both like, we can't

649
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,680
Speaker 4:  screw this up in this one house whitelists like one engineer from

650
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,200
Speaker 4:  each company on call to be like, all right, they asked to play classic rock

651
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,880
Speaker 4:  at 7:00 PM like make it happen. And like someone pushes the play on

652
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,840
Speaker 4:  Spotify on the Sonos side. Like, I don't know, I

653
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,600
Speaker 4:  I'm assuming there's some sort of complicated legal PR rub

654
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,720
Speaker 4:  Goldberg machine to make sure it works in my house, but I like

655
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,600
Speaker 4:  that's the dream, right? Is that you assemble all these components from all

656
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,920
Speaker 4:  these different vendors and you kind of get the, the best of everything

657
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,480
Speaker 4:  or at least as solution is more tailored to you. Yeah, right,

658
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,120
Speaker 4:  because what I want is the, the only reason we have Google

659
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,000
Speaker 4:  Homes is cuz of the photo feature on the, the on the Nest hubs. Yeah.

660
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,600
Speaker 4:  It's really good. And like, I don't know why Amazon hasn't built a good photo

661
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,360
Speaker 4:  system for the, I dunno why Apple they've tried,

662
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,200
Speaker 2:  Hasn't built one at all

663
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,920
Speaker 4:  And yeah, apple does the default, like just make the thing with the

664
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,880
Speaker 4:  screen, like people will buy it without a second hesitation. But like that's

665
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,160
Speaker 4:  what we want. So that's what we have. And then we want Sono speakers cuz

666
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,000
Speaker 4:  that works with all the other stuff we have and it's like I would get a home

667
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,840
Speaker 4:  pod, but again it's like the concrete table problem where it's like, it's

668
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,760
Speaker 4:  designed for this one, it's designed for Tim Cook. Yeah, Tim Cook's house

669
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,480
Speaker 4:  a lot of concrete furniture in it, you know, and like, it's just like you

670
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,360
Speaker 4:  don't make enough products here. I like, it's not versatile

671
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,200
Speaker 4:  enough where there's not, the product line is not versatile enough to,

672
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,200
Speaker 4:  to fit into all these spots in your house. So I I guess I'm coming out

673
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,720
Speaker 4:  from kind of the same place as you Alex, which is like, there's maybe one

674
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,520
Speaker 4:  room in my house where this would be great. Yeah, but there's like, I

675
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,080
Speaker 4:  want a smart home is like the home.

676
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,040
Speaker 6:  Yeah. This home pod is like slightly better, slightly cheaper, but

677
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,760
Speaker 6:  it's not gonna change the calculus on like who's buying it in the first place.

678
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,400
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And so I think like the first one wasn't a hit, I can't see this one

679
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,920
Speaker 6:  being like a smash hit either at 2 99, maybe once it goes down like

680
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,680
Speaker 6:  2, 2 49 at some stores that'll pick up some. But I think like on the whole

681
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,000
Speaker 6:  it's, it's the same HomePod, bit smarter.

682
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,320
Speaker 2:  What is the price you would like instant buy it

683
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,680
Speaker 6:  At? I think 1 99 for sure.

684
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,000
Speaker 4:  I'd be like sure buy it.

685
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,160
Speaker 5:  And that's the studio. The Echo Studio is 1 99.

686
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,640
Speaker 5:  Sonos one is 1 99 2. Right. Thereabouts.

687
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm just gonna say this out loud. A really good pair of regular

688
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,320
Speaker 4:  old stereo speakers sounds better than any of this stuff.

689
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,680
Speaker 4:  Blasphemy. Yes. It's it's just true. It's true.

690
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,600
Speaker 2:  It's true. Do you ever go into the, the home theater Reddit and it's like

691
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,320
Speaker 2:  half the people are there like I've just replaced my, my Sonos or my

692
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,280
Speaker 2:  vio soundbar or whatever and I just got two speakers and got

693
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,840
Speaker 2:  rid of my sub and it's like I'm hearing everything for the first time.

694
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,520
Speaker 4:  It's like way better. It's just way better. Yeah. There's there's an entire

695
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,040
Speaker 4:  other episode of the show on the specs that get marketed and in

696
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,440
Speaker 4:  whatever. I'm just saying like all these speakers are like inherently noisy

697
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,800
Speaker 4:  and they try to cover it up with extra processing because they're full of

698
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,680
Speaker 4:  radios and like if you just like make speakers that are not full of

699
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,560
Speaker 4:  radios and are connected with wires to clean sources, you're like in

700
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,360
Speaker 4:  a much better spot.

701
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,240
Speaker 2:  Whoa. But

702
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,760
Speaker 5:  That's the problem everyone, you know, we, we want these multi-use devices

703
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,040
Speaker 5:  now in our home. We expect more out of our speakers than to just play music

704
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,960
Speaker 5:  or just to play the audio from our tv. And it's, it's a problem

705
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,720
Speaker 5:  and it's actually a another problem. I mean Chris and I have talked about

706
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,480
Speaker 5:  this in the past, like Matter actually has a casting spec built in.

707
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:03,560
Speaker 5:  So in theory, if all these players keep playing nice

708
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,640
Speaker 5:  together, you know, we could be playing all our music on all of our

709
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,560
Speaker 5:  smart speakers and our airplay speakers. Everything could all work

710
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,640
Speaker 5:  harmoniously. But that doesn't seem like it's going to

711
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:15,920
Speaker 5:  happen.

712
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,400
Speaker 5:  Mainly because Sonos and, and Bos and, and a couple of

713
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,200
Speaker 5:  the other big speaker companies who are part of the csa,

714
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,080
Speaker 5:  which is behind Matter, don't seem to be actually making any movement

715
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,760
Speaker 5:  or any headway on doing this multi-room audio

716
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,440
Speaker 5:  between companies and the individual companies that have

717
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,280
Speaker 5:  multi-room audio like Amazon and Google and Apple, you know,

718
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,080
Speaker 5:  they wanna keep their, that the, these are little fons that look like they're

719
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,760
Speaker 5:  gonna stay. We're not, the whole kumbaya part of Matter

720
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,080
Speaker 5:  doesn't necessarily look like it's going to go through the entire

721
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,080
Speaker 5:  smart home space unfortunately. And audio is such a big ticket item for most

722
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,320
Speaker 5:  of these companies, right? Cuz they want you to stick with their streaming

723
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,480
Speaker 5:  service, their subscription service.

724
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,960
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think at the end of the day, like Amazon and Apple and Google, like

725
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,560
Speaker 4:  have no interest in making smart plugs or window shade

726
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,000
Speaker 4:  controllers cuz there's no recurring revenue against them. Like exactly.

727
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,320
Speaker 4:  And Apple's like it's our new smart plug. It, it's part of iCloud, it'll

728
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,120
Speaker 4:  cost $10 a month, people go away. And so like you see

729
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,720
Speaker 4:  where they're like willing to commodify the ecosystem, but streaming

730
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,440
Speaker 4:  services are recurring revenue. They are locked to a certain

731
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,000
Speaker 4:  extent. They are excellent places to upsell you to other parts of their

732
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,240
Speaker 4:  services bundle. There's no way to wanna go that

733
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,200
Speaker 5:  Stuff. No. So yeah, it's always going. The fragmentation is going to remain

734
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,640
Speaker 5:  on those levels for sure. We're not gonna get the simple Smart home for

735
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,480
Speaker 5:  many years.

736
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,760
Speaker 4:  Just make me in charge of everything. Who's the president of the CSA and

737
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,480
Speaker 4:  how do I take him out?

738
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:47,600
Speaker 2:  They gotta get you your Apple tv, your TV made by Apple.

739
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,320
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna go to that guy's house, reboot his Apple TV and he'll be having

740
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:50,640
Speaker 4:  shot.

741
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,760
Speaker 4:  I Sorry.

742
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,840
Speaker 2:  All right guys, so the, the reviews up now, Jenna and Chris worked on it

743
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,440
Speaker 2:  together. Thank you guys. We're gonna take a break and then when we get back

744
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,880
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna be talking with Catherine Tri DeCosta about faking your death online.

745
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,080
Speaker 2:  It makes sense in context. I swear

746
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:13,120
Speaker 4:  It's a hard segue. Can we fake the CSA guy's death

747
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:13,480
Speaker 4:  online?

748
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,160

Speaker 2:  All right, welcome back. I'm very excited because I'm talking with my friend

787
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,830
Speaker 2:  Catherine Tri DeCosta. We've worked together, we've been colleagues for many,

788
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:56,510
Speaker 2:  many years and one of our favorite things to talk about is

789
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,790
Speaker 2:  faking your death online.

790
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,710
Speaker 2:  I know that's like a weird thing to have a favorite to talk about, but Catherine

791
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,910
Speaker 2:  and I love to talk about it. And there was a super weird one that actually

792
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:10,310
Speaker 2:  appeared in the New York Times last month called a Fake Death in Romance

793
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,270
Speaker 2:  Landia. And it's all about this romance novelist who, you know,

794
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:17,750
Speaker 2:  faked her death. So like naturally I had to get together with Katherine,

795
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,710
Speaker 2:  we had to talk about it. She's like categorized fake deaths

796
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:25,670
Speaker 2:  into different buckets for reasons. It's, it's a whole thing. We're just

797
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:28,190
Speaker 2:  gonna go ahead and get to that chat right now with Katherine Trin DeCosta.

798
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:37,230
Speaker 2:  Hello Catherine. Thank you for joining me today. Thank

799
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:40,270
Speaker 2:  you for having me to talk about one of my favorite

800
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,590
Speaker 2:  topics of the world. Yeah, you, you and I have talked many times

801
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,470
Speaker 2:  about fandom and online communities in the absolutely

802
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:52,110
Speaker 2:  wild things that come out of it. And what we're talking about today

803
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,350
Speaker 2:  is this woman was a member of the romance novelist

804
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:00,230
Speaker 2:  community, specifically self-published romance novels. She was a

805
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:03,670
Speaker 2:  member of this community. She was super, super active. She was so active

806
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:07,510
Speaker 2:  that she was getting a lot of hate. And then one day someone appeared

807
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,430
Speaker 2:  on her her account and said she had this, was that it was her daughter and

808
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,830
Speaker 2:  she had passed away. Everybody mourned two years

809
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,350
Speaker 2:  passed. She reappeared on January 2nd of this year

810
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,430
Speaker 2:  to say, surprise, I am alive. I'm excited to get back into the

811
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:25,910
Speaker 2:  community. Let's have some fun. And the community

812
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:30,590
Speaker 2:  did not react with the same enthusiasm that this

813
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:34,470
Speaker 2:  author had. It's weird, it's almost as if if

814
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:38,430
Speaker 2:  you fake your own death and people mourn you, if you show

815
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:42,350
Speaker 2:  back up, people are not happy to see you. They are in

816
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:46,230
Speaker 2:  fact very upset by the emotional manipulation. Yeah,

817
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:50,070
Speaker 2:  and it was very interesting. The New York Times did a piece on

818
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:53,710
Speaker 2:  this and it was very focused on the mental health element. This woman had

819
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:57,870
Speaker 2:  been battling depression, she'd been battling other mental health issues

820
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:02,030
Speaker 2:  and she really laid a lot of it of the situation at the feet of, of, of

821
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:05,230
Speaker 2:  that. And we've just seen this

822
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:09,110
Speaker 2:  particular circumstance appear over and over and over again. Well, here's

823
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,990
Speaker 2:  the thing, if you are burnt out or if you are being attacked, it is

824
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:16,550
Speaker 2:  perfectly valid to want to take a break,

825
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,950
Speaker 2:  to want to leave that community, to want to not interact

826
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:24,710
Speaker 2:  with the people who are causing you harm. You see that actually a fair bit

827
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,830
Speaker 2:  when people are like, I'm just leaving social media, it's bad for me. People

828
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:31,520
Speaker 2:  are yelling and I I can't handle it. That is all perfectly valid.

829
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,440
Speaker 2:  Right. What you can't do is affect

830
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,200
Speaker 2:  other people's health by putting them through the trauma of

831
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,000
Speaker 2:  thinking someone they know has died. Right. And that's,

832
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,840
Speaker 2:  that's what happened here. Yes. If it's just about you, if it's just about

833
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,560
Speaker 2:  your health and this is a thing you actually see on the internet all the

834
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,240
Speaker 2:  time, you can just disappear. You don't have to make an announcement

835
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:58,120
Speaker 2:  even. Right. If you're not using your real name and they don't know who you

836
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,000
Speaker 2:  are, you can just leave. Yeah. You can always just leave.

837
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:05,640
Speaker 2:  So when you do something like this, it

838
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,160
Speaker 2:  becomes pretty clear that it's not just about

839
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,840
Speaker 2:  your own health, it's about something

840
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,160
Speaker 2:  else. It's either about like, you want to

841
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,880
Speaker 2:  bury this and never come back, which is why this person coming back was

842
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,520
Speaker 2:  unusual. Usually it's about trying to escape because yes,

843
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,040
Speaker 2:  something's about to catch up to you and you wanna cause trauma so that people

844
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,120
Speaker 2:  don't poke into it harder or it's just about attention on

845
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,840
Speaker 2:  its own. Right. So faking a death is like a

846
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,640
Speaker 2:  very extreme thing to do because it's not about you, it's about

847
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:43,840
Speaker 2:  the effect that fake death has on many other people. And I talked

848
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,400
Speaker 2:  to you about this like, it's like a spectrum. Yeah. When you fake your own

849
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,200
Speaker 2:  death, there's like a, an x-axis at Y axis and on the

850
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,840
Speaker 2:  xaxis is like, you should be a chart. You made a whole chart. Yes.

851
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:58,640
Speaker 2:  I drew a chart. So on the X axis there's like, are you killing

852
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,160
Speaker 2:  your fake killing yourself or are you fake killing like

853
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:06,120
Speaker 2:  members of your fake family or other things to like

854
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,920
Speaker 2:  get attention or to just like give an excuse as to

855
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,240
Speaker 2:  why something. And then the Y axis is like,

856
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:17,240
Speaker 2:  you are doing this because people are catching up to your con

857
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,800
Speaker 2:  and you need to go or you're doing it for attention

858
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:24,480
Speaker 2:  just purely for attention. And like these things

859
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:28,600
Speaker 2:  is all a spectrum and you can be, because it's the internet, it can both

860
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,800
Speaker 2:  be yourself and someone else at the same time.

861
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,000
Speaker 2:  And it can be a little bit of like, yeah, I wanna

862
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,720
Speaker 2:  leave this situation before my lies catch up to me, but I also want

863
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,680
Speaker 2:  attention. Yeah. And I think it's interesting that it, it really happens

864
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:47,800
Speaker 2:  in these fandom communities, right? Like you and

865
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,520
Speaker 2:  I are both members of fandom communities. We've both been, we've seen this

866
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,360
Speaker 2:  happen a lot in, in in the last 20 years.

867
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:59,400
Speaker 2:  What are some examples of this happening before? Because this wasn't the

868
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,080
Speaker 2:  first time we've seen somebody in a very small, very active

869
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,760
Speaker 2:  community suddenly, nope. Out of that community by

870
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,680
Speaker 2:  faking a death. So my little chart that I

871
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,200
Speaker 2:  made for myself actually doesn't have a ton of fandom examples because I

872
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,960
Speaker 2:  wanted to be more accessible to normal people. Ah-huh. So like

873
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:22,120
Speaker 2:  on one hand you have the Ban Tao thing, which has a documentary

874
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,000
Speaker 2:  came out recently about it and that was very

875
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,800
Speaker 2:  clearly a getting away fake

876
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,400
Speaker 2:  death, right? So the Man Tao story

877
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,320
Speaker 2:  was this football player on this Notre

878
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,240
Speaker 2:  Dame team that was doing really well. The major news cycle of that story

879
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,880
Speaker 2:  was that man Tao's grandmother and girlfriend

880
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,080
Speaker 2:  both died, that he continued to during that year

881
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,920
Speaker 2:  that he was playing for them, all of those things. And it turned out that

882
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,720
Speaker 2:  the girlfriend did not exist and that Tao

883
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,520
Speaker 2:  had been catfished, which is, you know, the term for someone pretending

884
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,760
Speaker 2:  to be someone else online to lure people into

885
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:07,840
Speaker 2:  various kinds of relationships. And in that case, the,

886
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,520
Speaker 2:  the person pretending to to be the girlfriend

887
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,520
Speaker 2:  was very clearly had killed this person off in an

888
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,960
Speaker 2:  attempt to end the lies, to sort of

889
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:23,000
Speaker 2:  get away from this sort of fake thing that the catfishing kill the

890
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,600
Speaker 2:  catfish. Right. So that's sort of in the self getaway

891
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,720
Speaker 2:  category in the dead center, this was a big story like I think a couple

892
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,440
Speaker 2:  years ago, like at zero zero on the graph is

893
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:38,160
Speaker 2:  Beth Ann McLaughlin. Now Beth Ann McLaughlin

894
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,440
Speaker 2:  was a professor at a university who

895
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,720
Speaker 2:  announced the death of another academic from C

896
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,480
Speaker 2:  O V I D, this academic having been a person

897
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,000
Speaker 2:  who had been very vocal and active in the

898
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,040
Speaker 2:  move for greater equality within the

899
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,520
Speaker 2:  sciences. So this person had been Native American

900
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,920
Speaker 2:  and disabled and queer I believe as well. And

901
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,720
Speaker 2:  then in a truly horrifying manipulation,

902
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:12,480
Speaker 2:  this other academic came up and said, oh she's,

903
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,280
Speaker 2:  she's died of Covid. And that turned out that she had less

904
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,920
Speaker 2:  died of Covid and more never existed and had in fact

905
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,880
Speaker 2:  been Beth and McLaughlin the whole time. So she had to get

906
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,640
Speaker 2:  rid of her because she couldn't have anybody. Yes. So this was both killing

907
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,160
Speaker 2:  somewhat a fake someone else and your fake self and it was to get

908
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,920
Speaker 2:  rid of both the con and clearly for attention, otherwise you wouldn't announce

909
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,800
Speaker 2:  it using your own real name. Like there's a lot going on

910
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,560
Speaker 2:  in that one. It's one of my favorites because it's, if this person

911
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,880
Speaker 2:  had paid attention to online fandoms, she would've known like

912
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,920
Speaker 2:  anytime you make an announcement

913
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,840
Speaker 2:  about someone else's death, they're gonna look at

914
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,640
Speaker 2:  you. So don't attach your real name to it. Like it was wild.

915
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,480
Speaker 2:  And then in the form of like clearly just doing it for

916
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,960
Speaker 2:  attention and like killing random family members

917
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:09,480
Speaker 2:  or like other people and then giving themselves cancer

918
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:13,400
Speaker 2:  is the infamous Miss Scribe, the fandom

919
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:16,720
Speaker 2:  person who had so many

920
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:21,080
Speaker 2:  massive moments of fandom, drama that it

921
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,040
Speaker 2:  involved a giant like eight part series

922
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:28,880
Speaker 2:  of posts where this person did more work than journalists

923
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:32,840
Speaker 2:  do in dissecting what had gone on. There's like a term

924
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,440
Speaker 2:  for when you're killing other people where it's, it's called munchhausen

925
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,160
Speaker 2:  by internet. Right. Because the, the famous thing is munchhausen by proxy.

926
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,000
Speaker 2:  That's when usually parents pretend or make

927
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,600
Speaker 2:  their child sick so that they can get attention as the

928
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,200
Speaker 2:  caregiver of a sick child, at least in munch housing by internet there

929
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,880
Speaker 2:  usually isn't a real child, but people will

930
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,800
Speaker 2:  for attention or sympathy beef up their trauma.

931
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,440
Speaker 2:  And I think the reason we're sort of seeing this acceleration of it

932
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:06,200
Speaker 2:  is that it's come with the acceleration of like

933
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,680
Speaker 2:  attention as a commodity online. Yes.

934
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:13,560
Speaker 2:  And so you can't just step away. You have to get attention

935
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,520
Speaker 2:  when you step away too. What's bigger attention getting

936
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:21,200
Speaker 2:  than dying? There's also like a

937
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,320
Speaker 2:  vindictiveness about it that is very internety that's very like,

938
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:29,360
Speaker 2:  you people did not appreciate me enough and

939
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,240
Speaker 2:  you did not like me enough or you did not pay me enough

940
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,360
Speaker 2:  attention. So in addition to doing this thing that'll get attention,

941
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,880
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna make it painful for you. I'm gonna make you feel bad

942
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,440
Speaker 2:  about it. Right. So I both get attention and I've gotten

943
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,440
Speaker 2:  back at you. Yeah. And going back to the, the Miss

944
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,480
Speaker 2:  Scribe example because that's I think one of the most interesting ones.

945
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,400
Speaker 2:  It was one of the earliest ones. This was like what early two thousands.

946
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,000
Speaker 2:  It was in the Harry Potter fandom community, which at the time was

947
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,600
Speaker 2:  one of the biggest online communities out there.

948
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,400
Speaker 2:  There was a lot of people involved and this whole

949
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,520
Speaker 2:  saga like took down fan websites. Like it it did

950
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,640
Speaker 2:  a lot. Yeah. It was, it created this, this huge

951
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:18,760
Speaker 2:  kind of catastrophe through the entire fandom community.

952
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,960
Speaker 2:  And a lot of people were involved, I believe Cassandra Claire, the

953
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:26,800
Speaker 2:  now very famous New York Times author was a part of that

954
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,640
Speaker 2:  community and, and was having to deal with the the, with it's having to

955
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,480
Speaker 2:  deal with it while also being accused of I think plagiarism within the community.

956
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,480
Speaker 2:  There was just a whole whole lot of mess. And

957
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,280
Speaker 2:  at the center of it was Miss Scribe who had had gotten involved with a

958
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,960
Speaker 2:  whole lot of people and then when things started to get really intense,

959
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:50,360
Speaker 2:  started killing off family members that we assumed did

960
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,120
Speaker 2:  not really exist. And a lot of the reporting done since then

961
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,840
Speaker 2:  bears out that, and I think it's really interesting because we really only

962
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,280
Speaker 2:  see this when the internet came around, this wasn't a

963
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:05,400
Speaker 2:  phenomenon as common pre-internet. And it was like, okay, we

964
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,920
Speaker 2:  can all communicate, we can all gather in these smaller groups now

965
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,880
Speaker 2:  and we can also get so intense that we don't necessarily

966
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,200
Speaker 2:  know how to regulate ourselves and escape these.

967
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:20,520
Speaker 2:  And I think like we've all had those moments where you're like, oh, I'm really

968
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,120
Speaker 2:  into this community and you need to figure out a way out. And these people

969
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,960
Speaker 2:  are like, okay, my great-grandmother's gonna die for a third time today.

970
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:32,000
Speaker 2:  Well I I didn't think of it actually as like going full circle before like

971
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:36,080
Speaker 2:  pictures and documents. You could fake your own death by

972
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,840
Speaker 2:  just walking to another town and claiming to be someone else, right? Yeah.

973
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,360
Speaker 2:  Like this used, this used to be an easier thing, but it didn't used to be

974
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,000
Speaker 2:  for attention. It was escape. It was always an escape thing.

975
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:50,720
Speaker 2:  It was a conmen trying to escape or

976
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,320
Speaker 2:  you know, various other things. People just trying to leave scandal behind.

977
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,960
Speaker 2:  There is sort of the infamous like theories about, about various

978
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,680
Speaker 2:  lords who fake their own deaths to just sort of get away.

979
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:06,480
Speaker 2:  So it used to be very easy to fake your own death, but that was killing your

980
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,800
Speaker 2:  real, the identity you were born in. Right. It wasn't

981
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,360
Speaker 2:  constructing and then killing off a fake identity quite as much. I mean for

982
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,280
Speaker 2:  conmen. Yeah. But like again, it was sort of, it was solely to get

983
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,240
Speaker 2:  away. The attention was not really part of it because you didn't actually

984
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,280
Speaker 2:  want that much attention. You wanted to be able to to get away. And

985
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,920
Speaker 2:  so now we've reached this this era where you can create

986
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,600
Speaker 2:  and kill non-real people sort of easily,

987
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:37,800
Speaker 2:  but you aren't doing it to get away from your real life

988
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,720
Speaker 2:  obligations or from the police. Cuz that's not gonna happen. You're

989
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,520
Speaker 2:  really doing it just to see how people react to get attention.

990
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,120
Speaker 2:  It's like the, it's like a TV trope, right? Where people like

991
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:53,040
Speaker 2:  attend their own funerals to see how people feel and, and all of those things.

992
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,280
Speaker 2:  And like yeah, in television that's not real.

993
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,520
Speaker 2:  It's a, it's a rhetorical device to, to allow you to

994
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,320
Speaker 2:  find out how people feel about characters.

995
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,440
Speaker 2:  And then people are now just like, I would like to know what people would

996
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,600
Speaker 2:  say about me if I died so I shall

997
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,960
Speaker 2:  die. I'll, I'll do a quick announcement, I'll post it

998
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,920
Speaker 2:  on Facebook or Tumblr or Twitter or wherever and then

999
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,840
Speaker 2:  I'm just gonna sit back and rake in the, the true feelings

1000
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,760
Speaker 2:  that that everybody has about me. Some personal news I

1001
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,720
Speaker 2:  died. Right. Yeah. That's basically what it's, they're just

1002
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,120
Speaker 2:  say okay, you know what, I'm just, I'm just looking for it. We don't know

1003
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,920
Speaker 2:  if that was necessarily the case in this instance. We don't

1004
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,880
Speaker 2:  know if this is the case with MEChA but revealing

1005
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,760
Speaker 2:  it and coming back to me very much screams I would like

1006
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,720
Speaker 2:  attention. Yeah. And very much screams too of that like of that

1007
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,840
Speaker 2:  internet vindictiveness of like, you all drove me to this and so I'm

1008
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,640
Speaker 2:  revealing it to you now so you'll feel extra bad. I believe her husband

1009
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,600
Speaker 2:  is now taking the blame as being the one who told her to do it. Yeah. And

1010
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,960
Speaker 2:  when she spoke with the New York Times, she said that things just got out

1011
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,440
Speaker 2:  of control. Her husband insisted on faking her death on the internet

1012
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:13,000
Speaker 2:  and when she started to feel better and feel like she wanted

1013
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,800
Speaker 2:  to return to the community, she did, the community has naturally

1014
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,160
Speaker 2:  not been really enthusiastic about her return.

1015
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:23,840
Speaker 2:  They are are not excited to see her. And

1016
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:27,520
Speaker 2:  it's unfortunate, it's unfortunate that she, she felt this was

1017
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:31,760
Speaker 2:  her best avenue forward. It's unfortunate that

1018
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,680
Speaker 2:  this community had to deal with a lot of trauma and grief over the last two

1019
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,480
Speaker 2:  years and a lot of people probably felt really bad. Good

1020
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,080
Speaker 2:  reminder, always be kind on the internet. You never know what's going on

1021
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,640
Speaker 2:  with someone else. Just be kind. But

1022
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:50,280
Speaker 2:  this one was, I just thought it was so interesting because reading it,

1023
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,640
Speaker 2:  every single part of it I heard, I was like Oh this sounds like Miss Scribe,

1024
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,480
Speaker 2:  this sounds like half a dozen other situations I've seen

1025
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,360
Speaker 2:  over the years in these smaller insular communities where someone

1026
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,240
Speaker 2:  just says F it, I wanna see what happens. And

1027
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,840
Speaker 2:  it was just truly kinda wild to me. This person seemed a lot less

1028
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,720
Speaker 2:  destructive about it in a, in a way because you can tell because

1029
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,200
Speaker 2:  she underestimated the negative response to coming back. Because

1030
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,080
Speaker 2:  in the sort of fandom examples it's either like desperation like

1031
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:24,840
Speaker 2:  oh no, people are real mad about real things that I have done

1032
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,720
Speaker 2:  to them because there are also many instances of like

1033
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:32,840
Speaker 2:  fake outs to get money for, for the fake conventions and

1034
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,680
Speaker 2:  things like I need to get away in a way that they won't, they

1035
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,360
Speaker 2:  will feel bad asking questions about Right. Or it's f all

1036
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,960
Speaker 2:  y'all like you are the worst people. Like you've

1037
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:47,840
Speaker 2:  ruined me and I wanna make you feel as bad as I did. So

1038
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:51,880
Speaker 2:  time to fake a death. And sometimes too like time to

1039
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,520
Speaker 2:  fake a death in the like most attention

1040
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,360
Speaker 2:  zeitgeisty way like the Beth Ann McLaughlin one to kill a

1041
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:04,080
Speaker 2:  fake native person with Covid. There's just like

1042
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:08,080
Speaker 2:  a lot of appropriation packed into like that

1043
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,800
Speaker 2:  one sentence as far as we know, she's, she's white, she's not

1044
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,760
Speaker 2:  part of the disabled community. She is not queer. Like

1045
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:19,880
Speaker 2:  she was just doing a lot of appropriation and then killing that

1046
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,280
Speaker 2:  person off just to feel happy. Yeah. Just to feel good about

1047
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,120
Speaker 2:  herself to like hurt other people. I think the thing that

1048
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,280
Speaker 2:  too about that one is like to look at Covid

1049
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,080
Speaker 2:  early on too. Like early on in the pandemic when it was

1050
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:38,880
Speaker 2:  so horrifying. I mean it's still b horrifying but when, when it was

1051
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:42,680
Speaker 2:  both horrifying and really uncertain what was going on, to

1052
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:46,760
Speaker 2:  see that as an opportunity to get rid of this thing you

1053
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,640
Speaker 2:  built is callous in a real specific way. Super, super

1054
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,360
Speaker 2:  callous. I think too, it speaks to like a very sort of immature

1055
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,840
Speaker 2:  internet sense. Like people being sort of, because they

1056
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,360
Speaker 2:  don't have to to act like an adult in a room with other adults, they sort

1057
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,960
Speaker 2:  of regress because it is the like childish like,

1058
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:09,960
Speaker 2:  oh I need to get out of a test. Grandma's been dead for

1059
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,200
Speaker 2:  five years, she won't mind if I kill her again. Like

1060
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:17,840
Speaker 2:  it, it has sort of that kind of logic to it. Yeah. The kind of

1061
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,800
Speaker 2:  logic a child has who does not really understand the real

1062
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,720
Speaker 2:  effects. Like you want attention but the, the difference between like I want

1063
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:29,640
Speaker 2:  attention and like this causes other people real pain to

1064
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,080
Speaker 2:  feel my pain is like a very sort of

1065
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,680
Speaker 2:  immature child conception of how like people process

1066
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,800
Speaker 2:  those kinds of announcements about peop about people because

1067
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,720
Speaker 2:  like to them it's gonna make them feel bad but it's not traumatic

1068
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,640
Speaker 2:  cuz it's not a real person that they know. Yeah. Except to those

1069
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,600
Speaker 2:  people who have empathy and are real humans. It does.

1070
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:58,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I think it's, it's this common thing we see in communities.

1071
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,200
Speaker 2:  It's often people who are kind of new to these communities, they, they

1072
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,960
Speaker 2:  forget that you can forge real relationships online without seeing

1073
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,160
Speaker 2:  people all the time. Catherine, you and I live on other sides of the country

1074
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,760
Speaker 2:  and we talk constantly. We talk

1075
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:15,720
Speaker 2:  all the time and we have a real relationship. We're friends. Yes we're gonna

1076
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,200
Speaker 2:  go to Disney World together. And I think people forget that. Yeah you can

1077
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,800
Speaker 2:  forge those relationships online. You can forge really impactful relationships

1078
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,560
Speaker 2:  online. And so when they, when they kill someone off, when they

1079
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,480
Speaker 2:  start to disrupt those for their own personal gain, there's

1080
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,680
Speaker 2:  something really kind of egregious about it. It feels just a little feels

1081
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,960
Speaker 2:  wild and you kind of laugh because we've seen enough of these at this point

1082
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,560
Speaker 2:  that I almost always laugh but it still feels kind of like you've taken

1083
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:44,160
Speaker 2:  advantage of people, other people's kindness and

1084
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,920
Speaker 2:  forgotten kind of the social codes that we are all usually very cognizant

1085
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,880
Speaker 2:  of in real life. And we oftentimes forget in a virtual

1086
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,840
Speaker 2:  space. I think one of the reasons that you and I are so fascinated by

1087
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,400
Speaker 2:  the fandom stuff is, this is gonna sound weird, it's

1088
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:03,480
Speaker 2:  like porn. Whatever technology porn goes to

1089
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,360
Speaker 2:  first is going to be the big technology. Similarly,

1090
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:10,520
Speaker 2:  fandom finds the drama center points

1091
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,240
Speaker 2:  years before the main street. So like when the internet

1092
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,360
Speaker 2:  first sort of started, everyone did this drama and now

1093
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:22,120
Speaker 2:  we're seeing it leak more into like other places,

1094
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,720
Speaker 2:  right? Like the Man Tayo thing was like a major college

1095
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,680
Speaker 2:  sports scandal, right? Which is far away from like

1096
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:33,480
Speaker 2:  two Harry Potter fanfic archives having a fight. Right?

1097
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:37,440
Speaker 2:  So you can, you can do that archiving like every time one of these things

1098
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,040
Speaker 2:  happen I text like various people who are

1099
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,240
Speaker 2:  journalists, friends of ours and I'm like, you're writing about this story.

1100
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:48,200
Speaker 2:  I need you to understand how many times this has happened and how

1101
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:52,160
Speaker 2:  easy it is to investigate and check and how it happens. And I think

1102
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,800
Speaker 2:  too for the fandoms where it still happens, they tend to be young

1103
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,800
Speaker 2:  fandoms because they tend to be younger people because they tend to have

1104
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,720
Speaker 2:  not lived through it already. Or in the case of of this fandom, this was

1105
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,440
Speaker 2:  a fandom where you had a lot of people who weren't

1106
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,080
Speaker 2:  maybe as online as someone like you or I or are people generally involved

1107
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,080
Speaker 2:  in fandom. It was right. These are people who were kind of new to using the

1108
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:16,520
Speaker 2:  internet to connect this way or were because they were

1109
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:20,560
Speaker 2:  self-publishing as authors were using real names or

1110
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:24,520
Speaker 2:  names that had associations to them that gives them a

1111
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:28,160
Speaker 2:  sense of security because it's like no one's going to do anything weird with

1112
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,720
Speaker 2:  their own name or the name. That is what they publish under

1113
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:35,440
Speaker 2:  not really realizing that that's what happens in Fanfic all the time.

1114
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:40,000
Speaker 2:  I think you're right. I think this is something that we see again and again

1115
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,720
Speaker 2:  in fandom. This is why you and I immediately both went, oh yeah, that woman

1116
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,080
Speaker 2:  faked her own death and then came back in the romance community. That's normal.

1117
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:50,400
Speaker 2:  And like we didn't even blink as other people were going, oh my god, you

1118
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,360
Speaker 2:  and I are like seen it. She didn't start a cult so she's like, yeah

1119
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:58,200
Speaker 2:  there's no snake wives, there's no cult going on. This is still

1120
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,840
Speaker 2:  beginner fuckery and fandom. Right. But, but thank you

1121
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,800
Speaker 2:  Katherine so much. I'm sure I'll probably, we'll probably have to bring you

1122
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,880
Speaker 2:  back the next time somebody does something truly wild that you and I have

1123
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,360
Speaker 2:  seen a billion times before in fandom to talk about it. It's gonna be a lot

1124
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,240
Speaker 2:  of fun. Thanks Katherine.

1125
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:22,840

01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,280
Speaker 2:  You know, it honestly didn't leave, it's been over a year since the steam

1161
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,240
Speaker 2:  deck came out and it's still going strong and there's been

1162
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:48,000
Speaker 2:  over like a hundred updates on it. There's been a ton of weird

1163
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,600
Speaker 2:  little software quirks and changes over the last year. It really, it feels

1164
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,920
Speaker 2:  like a different device from the thing that shipped back in

1165
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,680
Speaker 2:  February, 2022. And so that also means I gotta bring back Sean Hollister

1166
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:02,280
Speaker 2:  because he has spent over 435 hours

1167
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:06,400
Speaker 2:  with the steam deck. He and I are gonna talk about what's changed, what

1168
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,720
Speaker 2:  the drawbacks are that still exist and what Sean would probably score the

1169
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:13,640
Speaker 2:  thing if he had to score it right now. Hey Sean, thank you for joining me

1170
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,360
Speaker 2:  talking about the steam deck.

1171
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,960
Speaker 10:  Hey, it's great to be back. I love this thing.

1172
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:21,600
Speaker 2:  I really, really like my steam deck and I think you were one of the few people

1173
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,200
Speaker 2:  that likes their steam deck more than me. You loved it when it first came

1174
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:29,160
Speaker 2:  out, but you also were very clear-eyed about its mini mini flaws

1175
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,880
Speaker 2:  when it first came out. Yeah. And you've changed since then. But

1176
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,840
Speaker 2:  kind of walk me through when it first came out, how much you were disappointed.

1177
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:40,720
Speaker 10:  Yeah, let me, let me go back even a little bit further. I got to go to Val's

1178
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,640
Speaker 10:  headquarters before the Steam deck came out months

1179
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,040
Speaker 10:  before I got to try it. And I, I had this vision in my head

1180
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:52,360
Speaker 10:  of like, this is going to be where I buy my games

1181
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:56,320
Speaker 10:  now because I, I changed where I buy my PC games. I used to, I used

1182
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,760
Speaker 10:  to buy 'em of course on a PC and then I was like, well now all these great

1183
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,440
Speaker 10:  indie games and small games are coming out and I'm gonna play them on the

1184
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,240
Speaker 10:  Nintendo Switch instead. This is where I'm going to buy them because this

1185
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:08,800
Speaker 10:  is where I could actually play them. I can take them with me, I can play

1186
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,680
Speaker 10:  them in the bedroom, you know, and my, when my kids are trying to sleep

1187
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,000
Speaker 10:  and things like that, I can, I can take them on the go. I just wasn't getting

1188
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,920
Speaker 10:  enough time with kids to play my games on my actual pc. So

1189
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:22,480
Speaker 10:  I was giving Nintendo my money and I tried this steam deck. I'm like, oh

1190
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:26,000
Speaker 10:  my gosh, this is going to be the Nintendo switch of

1191
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:29,480
Speaker 10:  PCs not in that. It's gonna be like this thing I buy at retail that just

1192
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:33,400
Speaker 10:  plays my games well, but it's going to be where I buy my games cuz

1193
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,560
Speaker 10:  I can, I can just have the time to play them finally. And I was like, this

1194
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,440
Speaker 10:  could be great. And then the steam deck arrived on my doorstep

1195
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:44,640
Speaker 10:  in February, 2022 and the thing was

1196
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,400
Speaker 10:  just felt so messy and broken

1197
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,200
Speaker 10:  and buggy up, like, how the heck could you put this thing God's sail valve?

1198
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:56,680
Speaker 10:  And it wasn't just that it was, it was broken. Cause I, I've, I've used

1199
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:00,640
Speaker 10:  a lot of broken gadgets before. It was that valve was pulling the

1200
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,520
Speaker 10:  rug out from under me every single day with new updates. And

1201
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:08,080
Speaker 10:  some of these updates made things better and some of these updates made

1202
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:12,000
Speaker 10:  things worse during the period that I was supposed to review this and

1203
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,400
Speaker 10:  let the entire world know whether this device is any good or not.

1204
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:19,840
Speaker 10:  And so I wrote this thing was a mess. I said if

1205
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,320
Speaker 10:  Valve sold the console have been playing it best by our GameStop, people

1206
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,120
Speaker 10:  would return it in droves. The UI was

1207
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,200
Speaker 10:  sluggish and, and and crappy. The games, you'd launch a lot of

1208
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,320
Speaker 10:  games and they would just not launch, they would just go to a black screen.

1209
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,960
Speaker 10:  Some would crash in the middle, my wifi connection would

1210
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,840
Speaker 10:  disappear. My Bluetooth headset would pair and un pair so

1211
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,480
Speaker 10:  many issues with this thing at launch.

1212
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,080
Speaker 2:  There was other like big stuff like wasn't there an

1213
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,680
Speaker 2:  SD card issue where it would like just delete your games? Oh

1214
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:54,640
Speaker 10:  My gosh. Okay. So SD cards are this thing I I bricked,

1215
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,120
Speaker 10:  I i I could, you know, I bricked three SD cards,

1216
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,280
Speaker 2:  Like just had to throw 'em

1217
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,080
Speaker 10:  Out. Yes. Like I have one right here. I have a 256 gigabyte, very nice

1218
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:07,240
Speaker 10:  sand desk, extreme 256 gigabyte card here that I

1219
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:11,080
Speaker 10:  used to help review the Skydio two drone cuz you know, you need a very

1220
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,560
Speaker 10:  fast SD card for drone footage. You're getting a hundred megabits per second

1221
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,120
Speaker 10:  down from that, that camera. I stuck that thing in there. It it, it's a

1222
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,160
Speaker 10:  brick now because it didn't format the card properly.

1223
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:25,520
Speaker 10:  Valve had this issue where it was, it was trying to do like a

1224
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,920
Speaker 10:  full and complete format, like overwriting

1225
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:33,080
Speaker 10:  every bit on an SD card when you're doing it. And they switched to a quick

1226
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,680
Speaker 10:  format that's better. Doesn't break SD cards as far as I'm aware. But this

1227
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:40,400
Speaker 10:  thing where I, I lost three cards because of this. I plugged a,

1228
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,360
Speaker 10:  a solid state drive into the deck's USB port and

1229
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,840
Speaker 10:  the deck didn't know, I guess not to run

1230
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,840
Speaker 10:  devices too fast when it doesn't prive enough power cuz you know, it's,

1231
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:54,520
Speaker 10:  it's a small device with like a 48 wat hour battery. This steam deck. It

1232
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,280
Speaker 10:  doesn't have a lot of power for its SB port. Well my s sd in my

1233
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,960
Speaker 10:  enclosure a nice SSD I've been using for a while to transfer things between

1234
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:06,160
Speaker 10:  computers. The deck decided that it was going to just blow through

1235
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:09,960
Speaker 10:  that thing, download Giant game to it very quickly

1236
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:14,000
Speaker 10:  without providing it enough power. And so that got brick too.

1237
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:18,480
Speaker 10:  And so like this thing was a shit show at launch

1238
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:22,840
Speaker 10:  and yet you could already see the potential. There was so much

1239
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,800
Speaker 10:  potential there. They were fixing things very quickly. And so by

1240
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,760
Speaker 10:  the end of the review period, I was like, you probably should buy this

1241
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,240
Speaker 10:  thing today. It's not ready. But wow,

1242
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:38,680
Speaker 10:  you can play all of these old PC games and all these new PC

1243
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,520
Speaker 10:  games with all these horsepower, these amazing controls you can customize

1244
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:46,000
Speaker 10:  to do any kind of game. Phenomenal. And so I was like, okay,

1245
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,400
Speaker 10:  maybe this thing will be great.

1246
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:51,200
Speaker 2:  So was it like the flexibility of the

1247
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,040
Speaker 2:  device was so good that you could overlook the fact

1248
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,840
Speaker 2:  that you had now spent hundreds of dollars of your own

1249
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,720
Speaker 2:  money in the process of reviewing it just washed that money down

1250
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,080
Speaker 2:  the drain?

1251
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:07,240
Speaker 10:  There were, yes. Yes. I I I

1252
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:11,040
Speaker 10:  wanna throw some caveats in there. First off, we gave this thing a score

1253
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:15,040
Speaker 10:  that today would've probably fleshed would probably be at like a

1254
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,960
Speaker 10:  4.5 at the time we give it a 6.5. But like if you read

1255
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,840
Speaker 10:  our descriptions of how we review devices today, we

1256
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,320
Speaker 10:  would've have, we would have to give it like less than a 5.0 back then because

1257
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,280
Speaker 10:  Right. We do not like telling people to bike gadgets

1258
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,440
Speaker 10:  that are not ready, that have a lot of issues with them that may not pan

1259
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,280
Speaker 10:  out. Yeah. At the time though, yes, I, I could see that

1260
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,840
Speaker 10:  this thing was already fun to use

1261
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:44,880
Speaker 10:  and that's super important. Like, people wanna buy things that are fun.

1262
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,400
Speaker 10:  Right. Even if, yeah, even if part of the fun is like figuring out how to

1263
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,280
Speaker 10:  make games run on a console. I I I've read so many, I don't, I

1264
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:56,080
Speaker 10:  I think you're also in the steam deck subreddit. Yes. And there are so many

1265
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,640
Speaker 10:  people in there who post how much fun they're having, just figuring out

1266
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,440
Speaker 10:  how to make various games work, figuring out all kinds of

1267
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,400
Speaker 10:  cool things to do with it as a full Linux pc. A lot of people say

1268
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,520
Speaker 10:  they're doing more of that than they are actually playing games, which is,

1269
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:10,920
Speaker 10:  yeah.

1270
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:14,920
Speaker 2:  Funny to me there's guys who are saying, oh, I, I plug it

1271
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:18,840
Speaker 2:  into my TV and I use like a PS4 controller and I

1272
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,680
Speaker 2:  just use it as like a console, like a traditional console now. And, and there's

1273
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:25,960
Speaker 2:  people who are like, oh yeah, I use it as my primary computer.

1274
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:30,040
Speaker 2:  It just seems like this great, it's, it's for the tinkerers, it's for all

1275
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,400
Speaker 2:  the people who just like to, to mess with

1276
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:36,040
Speaker 10:  Stuff. I've seen people do video editing on this,

1277
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:39,800
Speaker 10:  on this computer. Oh, I, I've seen people like piece together, you know,

1278
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,320
Speaker 10:  stuff for their work. I saw there's a, one of the developers of

1279
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:47,600
Speaker 10:  vlc, the amazing open source video player

1280
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,400
Speaker 10:  that, you know, just, you can play it plays anything you throw at it is

1281
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:54,280
Speaker 10:  working on a way to turn the deck into like a miniature tv, internet

1282
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,000
Speaker 10:  streaming tv. So it'll, it'll just stream down like channels over the web

1283
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,840
Speaker 10:  or something. I don't know. Yeah. I want a portable tv, I want a

1284
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,600
Speaker 10:  handheld device that can double as my work PC and a pinch. I

1285
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,400
Speaker 10:  want a, a game system that flawlessly runs all my

1286
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,080
Speaker 10:  Game Cube and we games because there's an emulator that somebody put

1287
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,080
Speaker 10:  on Linux like

1288
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,480
Speaker 2:  Just flawlessly.

1289
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:18,440
Speaker 10:  Yes. It does all these things and the controls,

1290
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,320
Speaker 10:  which are many of them carryovers from the, the, the cult classic steam

1291
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,080
Speaker 10:  controller that valve released a number of years ago and then had to put

1292
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,320
Speaker 10:  on a $5 fire sale. Anyhow, if you missed out on the steam controller,

1293
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:31,880
Speaker 10:  the controls in here just let you do

1294
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:36,840
Speaker 10:  so much. I have, I'm, I'm playing through trails in the sky

1295
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,280
Speaker 10:  now. It's a, it's an RPG game with a lot of dialogue. I have

1296
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,800
Speaker 10:  three of the buttons on my steam deck set to be turbo buttons

1297
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,760
Speaker 10:  so that I can speed through the dialogue and you know, the sword swinging

1298
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,240
Speaker 10:  when, when I'm, you know, trying to build up my CP to do the big flashy

1299
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,400
Speaker 10:  magic and special attacks. Yeah. When I am playing

1300
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:57,920
Speaker 10:  Genson impact, which you're not really supposed to be able to play on the

1301
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,680
Speaker 10:  steam deck but you can because somebody built a client

1302
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:05,240
Speaker 10:  for it in Lennox and also because I can stream

1303
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:08,800
Speaker 10:  Genson impact for my PlayStation five cuz there's a PlayStation five streaming

1304
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,560
Speaker 10:  client on the deck, which is amazing and

1305
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,840
Speaker 2:  It works really well.

1306
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:15,920
Speaker 10:  It works really well when I'm playing that game on a PS five by itself or,

1307
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,360
Speaker 10:  or or you know, any of the other consoles. It's really difficult to aim

1308
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:23,280
Speaker 10:  a bow with like some of the bow characters in that game. Which is

1309
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,800
Speaker 10:  annoying because the game roars you for you know, pitting enemy creatures

1310
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,720
Speaker 10:  in the head with a bow for some reason. I don't know why. Anyhow, the deck

1311
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:34,200
Speaker 10:  has gyroscopic aiming that you can add to

1312
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,480
Speaker 10:  literally anything you play on it. Including

1313
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,640
Speaker 10:  streaming a game from my PlayStation five to the

1314
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:45,280
Speaker 10:  handheld. So my deck is transmitting its

1315
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:49,440
Speaker 10:  gyroscopic motions over my home wifi to my PlayStation

1316
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:53,320
Speaker 10:  five to tell my PlayStation five how far to move virtual analog

1317
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:57,200
Speaker 10:  stick so that the bow of my anime character can line up with

1318
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,920
Speaker 10:  the head of some legendary monster in this game. And

1319
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:02,960
Speaker 10:  it feels like it's running locally because,

1320
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,080
Speaker 2:  And that's just

1321
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,240
Speaker 10:  Cool. There's just so much cool shit you can do with the deck. But that's

1322
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:11,040
Speaker 10:  not what the focus of my recent piece was.

1323
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,760
Speaker 10:  Like. The main thing I want to tell you today, the main thing I wrote in

1324
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:18,680
Speaker 10:  my like long-term review is that yes there's, there's

1325
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:22,440
Speaker 10:  this whole ecosystem of cool things but also you can

1326
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:26,400
Speaker 10:  just use the steam deck now as a game system and it works

1327
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:30,280
Speaker 10:  and it did not at launch. That was not the case. Yeah. Nearly a year ago

1328
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:30,880
Speaker 10:  when it launched.

1329
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:34,800
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And it works with like a wide variety of

1330
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,280
Speaker 2:  games. I know we've seen some complaints on the, the the

1331
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,800
Speaker 2:  subreddits cuz somebody goes and they played like this really

1332
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,480
Speaker 2:  nobody's ever heard of it game from 20 years ago and they're like, oh the

1333
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,920
Speaker 2:  steam deck doesn't work out of the box with it. But most modern games, most

1334
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,760
Speaker 2:  new games, it works pretty, pretty well out of the box. I played

1335
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:55,640
Speaker 2:  like just three days of vampire survivors. My sister was like, don't you

1336
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,640
Speaker 2:  wanna say hi to me? I haven't seen you in a year. I'm here for Christmas.

1337
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,560
Speaker 2:  And I was like, I I sure. But after I get through this

1338
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,240
Speaker 2:  level Yeah like just totally glued to it cuz it

1339
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,920
Speaker 2:  played so, so well. It works so well. And also I could like

1340
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:13,640
Speaker 2:  huff the, the fumes off of the fan on the steam deck.

1341
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:17,240
Speaker 10:  This is, this is a beautiful in joke also from the steam deck subreddit

1342
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:20,840
Speaker 10:  and discords everybody, ed sa how, how good it

1343
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,800
Speaker 10:  smells the the chipped fumes that are coming out through the fan. I don't

1344
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,720
Speaker 10:  know what that is. I'm guessing it's just warm air.

1345
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:31,080
Speaker 2:  Probably the should not be huffing it probably, this is a

1346
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,920
Speaker 2:  disclaimer. Do not huff those smells. We

1347
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:38,840
Speaker 2:  cannot be held liable for it. Please don't do it. We don't know what's

1348
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,280
Speaker 2:  in it but man it smells great.

1349
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:44,240
Speaker 10:  It does, it does. At the risk of reduction, there are three

1350
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:47,920
Speaker 10:  reasons why games might not work on the steam deck.

1351
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,800
Speaker 10:  Okay. One is they are big modern games

1352
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:55,840
Speaker 10:  but they use anti cheat software. That's the biggest one. Some of the

1353
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,720
Speaker 10:  biggest games in the world will not work on the steam

1354
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:03,520
Speaker 10:  deck. Like PUBG Lost Ark, college Duty,

1355
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:07,240
Speaker 10:  war Zone, rust, destiny two, a lot of of

1356
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:11,200
Speaker 10:  these games don't work Bec not because the Steam deck doesn't support anti

1357
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:14,760
Speaker 10:  Sheet. In fact, valve went out of their way to go ahead and say

1358
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:18,880
Speaker 10:  Hey big providers of anti sheet, easy anti sheet and

1359
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,720
Speaker 10:  battle I we're gonna make you work. Hey developers, all you have to do is

1360
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,600
Speaker 10:  enable them. That's not the reason they don't work. They don't work because

1361
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:29,640
Speaker 10:  the developers, the publishers decided they weren't willing to take

1362
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:33,200
Speaker 10:  the risk of enabling these. And then maybe

1363
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,480
Speaker 10:  somebody on Linux figures out some kind of cool hack

1364
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:40,840
Speaker 10:  because these anti cheat software can't necessarily run

1365
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:44,760
Speaker 10:  as effectively in the kernel level manner that it wants to

1366
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:48,760
Speaker 10:  because there is no way for them to control what happens on

1367
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,760
Speaker 10:  Lennox the way they can on Windows. Now somebody's gonna listen to

1368
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,120
Speaker 10:  the podcast, they're gonna be like, oh it's totally possible. You could

1369
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:59,080
Speaker 10:  totally build a system where this works. What Tim Sweeney

1370
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,600
Speaker 10:  at Epic Games who says Fortnite will not come to this.

1371
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:07,280
Speaker 10:  What, what Tim Sweeney will tell you is that they don't

1372
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:11,240
Speaker 10:  want to spend the money to build such a system. They don't think it's worthwhile

1373
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:14,800
Speaker 10:  for the amount of players they'll get in return. Right. So I I mean he didn't

1374
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,880
Speaker 10:  say that explicitly but reading between the lines of what he told us, that's,

1375
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:18,520
Speaker 10:  that's what he's saying.

1376
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:22,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It it's an investment to to build support for

1377
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:26,120
Speaker 2:  the Steam deck. And one of the reasons I think it's so popular thus far is

1378
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:29,800
Speaker 2:  that the investment for most game developers is fairly

1379
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,360
Speaker 2:  minimal. Right. When they don't have the anti cheat

1380
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,520
Speaker 10:  Software. Yeah I would say even if they do have the anti cheat software,

1381
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,320
Speaker 10:  it's minimal to enable it to work but

1382
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:43,040
Speaker 10:  it's not necessarily minimal to satisfy your

1383
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:46,400
Speaker 10:  company and your shareholders that you will have not

1384
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:50,360
Speaker 10:  inadvertently created some kind of loophole that will come to bite you in

1385
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,760
Speaker 10:  the ass down the road. Yeah. That might be the expensive part. Yeah. Most

1386
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,120
Speaker 10:  games just work Anti cheat is one reason they don't work.

1387
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:01,040
Speaker 10:  Another reason why they don't work is because they are old

1388
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,400
Speaker 10:  enough that whatever game company built it

1389
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:08,560
Speaker 10:  had to do something very customer proprietary with

1390
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,480
Speaker 10:  the software that they used to run, say the video cut scenes at

1391
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:16,120
Speaker 10:  the beginning of the game, some games will not launch

1392
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:20,280
Speaker 10:  simply because they cannot launch the video that plays

1393
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:23,960
Speaker 10:  at the very beginning of the game and the rest of the game would run.

1394
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:28,160
Speaker 10:  And the reason we know this is because most of the games on the steam deck

1395
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,160
Speaker 10:  that are designed for Windows run on a compatibility layer called Proton

1396
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:35,920
Speaker 10:  that is developed primarily by valve open source developers that

1397
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,720
Speaker 10:  Valve is paying to improve proton's compatibility but there is

1398
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:43,280
Speaker 10:  also a fork of proton called Proton ge which stands for

1399
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,520
Speaker 10:  glorious egg roll.

1400
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:45,160
Speaker 2:  Oh

1401
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:49,080
Speaker 10:  Wow. Which I love. Which is maintained by people who do not care so much

1402
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,320
Speaker 10:  about proprietary things that they may not have the legal rights to use

1403
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:57,000
Speaker 10:  and they're some games that will just run because they said they built in

1404
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,520
Speaker 10:  whatever the proprietary video Kodak was and so you can see a game that

1405
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:04,320
Speaker 10:  wouldn't work on the main fork of Proton just does on the

1406
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,480
Speaker 10:  glorious egg roll version.

1407
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:09,440
Speaker 2:  Are there examples of games off the top of your head that that don't work?

1408
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,280
Speaker 2:  Because I definitely have, I think I've run into this situation and I'm just

1409
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,600
Speaker 2:  completely blanking on any games

1410
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:17,960
Speaker 10:  A persona for Golden was not working on the steam deck

1411
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:21,560
Speaker 10:  at launch. It had issues with I think with cut scenes and also with audio

1412
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,920
Speaker 10:  there was some kind of audio glitch as well in glorious egg roll. It worked

1413
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,600
Speaker 10:  perfectly and then Valve went back and worked with

1414
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,440
Speaker 10:  Proton two I think get around some of those issues. I don't know if it uses

1415
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,400
Speaker 10:  some kind of compatibility layer for the for the Codex now or what, but

1416
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,840
Speaker 10:  they did make it work and they made it a full deck verified game.

1417
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,760
Speaker 10:  I know that currently the longest journey the last time I tried to play

1418
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,160
Speaker 10:  the Longest Journey, which is a, a famous point and click adventure

1419
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:50,960
Speaker 10:  that does not run on Steam deck. I can't remember if it works in glorious

1420
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,760
Speaker 10:  egg roll or not but I would, I would bet you 10 bucks that is one of those

1421
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:58,640
Speaker 10:  issues where it's just some Kodak or some thing

1422
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,240
Speaker 10:  that they try to launch at the beginning of the game doesn't work properly

1423
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,240
Speaker 10:  and that's the reason it doesn't play cuz there's no reason why the deck

1424
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,360
Speaker 10:  shouldn't be able to play that

1425
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:08,720
Speaker 2:  Game. Yeah, I think one of the ones I run into is Crusader King's three.

1426
01:24:08,730 --> 01:24:12,480
Speaker 2:  Ah, it's got some like weird popups at the beginning of the game and sometimes

1427
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,680
Speaker 2:  I can get right through 'em and get to play and sometimes

1428
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:19,440
Speaker 2:  I wanna fling my beloved steep deck across the room.

1429
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:23,280
Speaker 10:  Yeah. So it's so it's anti cheat. One reason video codex or

1430
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:27,200
Speaker 10:  or other proprietary techniques that they use that you

1431
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:31,120
Speaker 10:  know, the Steam deck doesn't know how to interpret yet or and this is also

1432
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:35,000
Speaker 10:  a a relatively large category at this point. It actually does work

1433
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,920
Speaker 10:  and and Valve just is marking it as unsupported because they haven't

1434
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:42,480
Speaker 10:  fully tested it yet. Which is wild. It is wild to me. Not that they haven't

1435
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,840
Speaker 10:  tested the whole library, but it's wild to me how many games valves says

1436
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:49,720
Speaker 10:  hey this doesn't work. But they haven't gone back to

1437
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,600
Speaker 10:  retest and it actually does.

1438
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:55,920
Speaker 2:  Mass Effect is a good example of that. The the legendary edition, the majority

1439
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,520
Speaker 2:  of people who play it have no issues with it but it continues to say

1440
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:01,360
Speaker 2:  does not work, don't try it.

1441
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,920
Speaker 10:  Mass effect is the one where there was a period of time where it wouldn't

1442
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:08,840
Speaker 10:  launch unless you like jumped through some hoops because

1443
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,680
Speaker 10:  EA broke that and it broke a lot of other EA games

1444
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:16,640
Speaker 10:  by introducing a new version of their EA launcher, which used to be called

1445
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:19,560
Speaker 10:  Origin. That's a whole long story. They introduced a new version of the

1446
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,480
Speaker 10:  EA app and it just, they never tested it on the deck and it didn't work

1447
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:26,320
Speaker 10:  and it broke everything and you couldn't see the prompts that you

1448
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,600
Speaker 10:  needed to click through in order to get into your game. It would ask you

1449
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,680
Speaker 10:  like several things and those things wouldn't graphically show up on the

1450
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:36,440
Speaker 10:  deck they do now, particularly if you enable proton experimental.

1451
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:41,000
Speaker 10:  But those are still all marked unsupported because EA hasn't quite

1452
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:45,560
Speaker 10:  finished it yet. So they run properly like EA keeps breaking

1453
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:48,960
Speaker 10:  it with new versions and so Valve, I think Valve is waiting until that all

1454
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,640
Speaker 10:  settles down. But like the Witcher two stalker

1455
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:56,200
Speaker 10:  shadow of Chernobyl excom enemy within the original

1456
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:00,040
Speaker 10:  Halflife, those games are all marked as unsupported and they all just

1457
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:00,880
Speaker 10:  run

1458
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:04,640
Speaker 2:  And now everything seems to be ready. Well not everything but

1459
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:08,400
Speaker 2:  a lot of it like it seems like something where I could

1460
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:12,240
Speaker 2:  recommend it to a family member and not have to worry about

1461
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,720
Speaker 2:  doing tech support all the time.

1462
01:26:13,990 --> 01:26:17,600
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I largely agree with you. Like I recommend this now to people

1463
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,200
Speaker 10:  who want a PC gaming system that they

1464
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,480
Speaker 10:  could take with you. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to people who do

1465
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:29,200
Speaker 10:  not like the PC of experience of like tweaking

1466
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:32,680
Speaker 10:  settings because you can still absolutely play a game on Steam Deck and

1467
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:36,640
Speaker 10:  be like, this runs, but it doesn't run very well. And

1468
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:39,400
Speaker 10:  if you come from the PC background where you're like, okay, I will turn

1469
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:43,360
Speaker 10:  down the shadows and you know, and set the game spec to low,

1470
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:47,440
Speaker 10:  but then I will increase the anti aliasing because this is a

1471
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:51,200
Speaker 10:  seven 20 p, you know, 800 piece screen where you really need anti

1472
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:54,560
Speaker 10:  aliasing or else games look Pixely if I'm coming from that background or

1473
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,160
Speaker 10:  if I know the person I'm recommending it comes from that background. Absolutely

1474
01:26:57,330 --> 01:27:00,720
Speaker 10:  no question. If you have $400 to spend, you want this portable gaming pc

1475
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:04,640
Speaker 10:  do it. If you're the kind of person who, like you want everything to

1476
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:08,320
Speaker 10:  just work like sticking a cartridge into a Nintendo Switch

1477
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:12,000
Speaker 10:  works and you don't want to think about settings ever,

1478
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:15,520
Speaker 10:  it's not there yet. It could be there someday,

1479
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:19,480
Speaker 10:  but if you're that kind of person, I would wait until Future

1480
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:20,640
Speaker 10:  handhelds.

1481
01:27:20,670 --> 01:27:24,520
Speaker 2:  That's fair. I think that's, well they can go just get a switch and tell

1482
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:25,840
Speaker 2:  then it plays a lot of these games.

1483
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:28,680
Speaker 10:  But you probably shouldn't because there'd probably be a Switch Pro next

1484
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:32,440
Speaker 10:  year. But anyhow, moving on. Or this year it's 2023. I expect

1485
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:35,440
Speaker 10:  this holiday. Well may maybe we'll have something. I don't know.

1486
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:38,800
Speaker 2:  Well thank you Sean for coming on and, and talking about the seam deck.
