00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,590

Speaker 5:  Alex Kranz is here.

24
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,940
Speaker 7:  I I'm your friend that loves to open the phone with just like one thumb.

25
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,860
Speaker 5:  Just like do a, just

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,770
Speaker 7:  Boom pop flip. I'm trying to think of what the noise

27
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,050
Speaker 7:  is. Okay. Cause I haven't used a flip phone in so long

28
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,210
Speaker 5:  In 1999. Yeah. And purchased a cell phone called the Sony

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,210
Speaker 5:  Zuma CMC 200. It's the best phone ever made.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,570
Speaker 7:  Okay.

31
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,090
Speaker 5:  It was, seems unlikely. It was amazing. I bought a used one. I have one at

32
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,090
Speaker 5:  my house, like a perfect condition. One D I to talk about this all the time,

33
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,170
Speaker 5:  it had a stock to open, like the mic flips

34
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,450
Speaker 5:  down from the body of the phone.

35
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,730
Speaker 7:  Yes. Nevermind. This is a good

36
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,330
Speaker 5:  Phone. And so when it had the Sony Jo dial, so it had like a,

37
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,450
Speaker 5:  you know, had a multi element, led display that like I love it. The text.

38
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,570
Speaker 5:  So you'd like scroll to a name and then if you could get it exactly right.

39
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,050
Speaker 5:  You could make the call by flipping the stock. That's awesome. And then when

40
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,770
Speaker 5:  you were done, you'd be like,

41
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,250
Speaker 7:  Oh my gosh.

42
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,850
Speaker 5:  And I practiced that move so many times,

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,130
Speaker 7:  Like in the mirror, I gotta

44
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,010
Speaker 5:  Google. I was like scroll flip baby. And my friends in high school were like

45
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,130
Speaker 5:  one, why are you the weirdo with a cell phone? And two stop saying

46
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,770
Speaker 5:  scrolling flip.

47
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,530
Speaker 5:  But I have it again. It was the one of the best ever let's do this. And my

48
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,810
Speaker 5:  all town, top five cell phones. Yeah. Sony Zuma. CMZ 200. Just putting

49
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,130

50
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,330
Speaker 5:  way. I do exist. And I have bad news about streaming.

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,130
Speaker 5:  It's true. So we have been remote for a million years. We're all together

52
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,600
Speaker 5:  in the studio today, which is crazy. It's literally never happened. It's

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,440
Speaker 5:  gonna be the, we were it's

54
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,240
Speaker 7:  The first, the first

55
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,840
Speaker 5:  Time we were just sternly told that we can't talk over each other because

56
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,840
Speaker 5:  Andrew can't fix it in post. Like he can when we are all apart.

57
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,880
Speaker 5:  So this one's gonna be nuts. But Richard is actually in town. I don't think

58
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,600
Speaker 5:  he's been with us in person. Since you started at the

59
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,560
Speaker 5:  verge over a year. Now that's crazy. But if you wanna go all

60
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,840
Speaker 5:  the way back to like end gadget, podcast days, Richard and I worked together

61
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Speaker 5:  at end gadget. I used to see you in person all the time, but it was at like

62
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,840
Speaker 5:  CES at like three in the morning. I'd like, there's Richard. My, I, I need

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Speaker 5:  to lean over and touch the ground. Richard is here,

64
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,760
Speaker 5:  but it's gonna see you in person. We're all here. There's a lot going on.

65
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Speaker 5:  I wanna start with a little update. Okay. There's a Samsung event. We gotta

66
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,440
Speaker 5:  talk about there's folding phones. There's Disneys happening. There's

67
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,480
Speaker 5:  little GA lightning on, but we gotta start with an update. Last week we talked

68
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,920
Speaker 5:  about HVX maybe dying, maybe live, who knows what's gonna happen? We said,

69
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,000
Speaker 5:  when there's news we'll have an emergency podcast. You had may have noticed

70
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,200
Speaker 5:  we had no such emergency podcast because the news was like

71
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,880
Speaker 5:  just a devastating, nothing. Yeah, it was devastating. And they announced

72
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,200
Speaker 5:  that they will eventually kill HBO max. Right.

73
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,400
Speaker 5:  Sometime next year. But for now, everything is cool.

74
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,600
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's all gonna go on discovery plus a stack. So if you hate the

75
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,240
Speaker 7:  HBO max app, good news.

76
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,520
Speaker 5:  So does the CEO of discovery.

77
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,880
Speaker 7:  He also hates it. If you hate the HBO content, bad news, he

78
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,360
Speaker 7:  also hates it. Yeah, no,

79
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,480
Speaker 6:  It's so expensive. Yeah. It's so much cheaper to just like rebuild houses

80
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,640
Speaker 6:  in Texas than to do other things. Game of Thrones

81
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,800
Speaker 6:  is way more expensive than that.

82
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,560
Speaker 5:  They did have this slide where they talked about their franchises and they

83
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,360
Speaker 5:  were like game of Thrones and Harry Potter. And

84
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,400
Speaker 5:  then the 90 day fiance universe. This is a real thing they put

85
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,800
Speaker 5:  on the slide. It was incredible.

86
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,960
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Those were not good slides. There was like the male skewed

87
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,480
Speaker 7:  males apparently. Oh, that was awesome. You guys love plots. Yeah. You love

88
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,560
Speaker 7:  scripts. Female skewed. We, we just love reality.

89
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,160
Speaker 7:  That's not true though.

90
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,160
Speaker 7:  Think I gotta send a note, but it was great

92
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,600
Speaker 6:  If nobody's getting married this episode out, not percent

93
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,280
Speaker 7:  Out, I turned the TV off fling the

94
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,600
Speaker 5:  Remote. So what they've decided to do is they are gonna merge HBO, max and

95
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,440
Speaker 5:  discovery. Plus they haven't decided what it's called. Yeah. They're gonna

96
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,000
Speaker 5:  have a new app. That's like all the content from HBO, max

97
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,880
Speaker 5:  on the technology of the discovery plus app

98
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,360
Speaker 5:  is the discovery plus app. Good. Does anyone know the, they used it. It might

99
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,640
Speaker 5:  only be perceived as good because it never crashes, but that's because no

100
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,880
Speaker 5:  one uses, right? Yes. That's like, I, I think that might be the mistake they're

101
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,960
Speaker 5:  making, but he, they seem to like,

102
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,360
Speaker 6:  It's fine. Yeah. Like it is definitely possible that there are just 12 people

103
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,840
Speaker 6:  using it. And so it's not a problem, but like the app is fine. It's not the

104
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,920
Speaker 6:  like trash heap that HBO max is. So that's good.

105
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,320
Speaker 7:  Well, we think that right because HBO, max people actually use it.

106
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,560
Speaker 6:  No, but the thing, when you go to load HBO, max, and it's like, oh, would

107
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,120
Speaker 6:  you like to see some thumbnails for the shows you're watching come back in

108
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,360
Speaker 6:  30 to 40 minutes, like at least discovery plus doesn't do

109
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,080
Speaker 7:  That. Right? No I'm saying that's because no one uses it. Like you

110
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,880
Speaker 7:  maybe if, if it has 50 more million users, everybody

111
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,960
Speaker 7:  get everyone, you know, and everyone else, you know, to

112
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,280
Speaker 5:  Describe the car and subscribe to discovery, plus right

113
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,440
Speaker 7:  Now

114
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,520
Speaker 5:  Code is

115
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,000
Speaker 7:  See if it works, let us know report back.

116
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,640
Speaker 5:  Could it, could it actually hold up to a game of Thrones premier night ever?

117
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,720
Speaker 5:  We don't know. Yeah. They, they think it will. So like I said,

118
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,200
Speaker 5:  it was this news, as you can hear was not worth an emergency podcast. Yes.

119
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,480
Speaker 5:  But it is true that they're gonna kill HV max the app, and then relaunch

120
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,160
Speaker 5:  it, maybe still called HVX on a new technology platform. And that, that will

121
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,680
Speaker 5:  also have the content of discovery. Plus

122
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,360
Speaker 7:  I think it's gonna be HBO DOE.

123
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,680
Speaker 5:  I mean, they do love the stupid names. Again, this is a company and they

124
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,160
Speaker 5:  decided that their new corporate tagline is the stuff dreams are made of

125
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,760
Speaker 5:  which is the discovery plus app.

126
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,680
Speaker 6:  Just call it 90 day. Fiance, the streaming service. Well,

127
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,760
Speaker 5:  We'll come back to streaming cuz we gotta talk about Disney, Disney, all

128
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,920
Speaker 5:  kinds of stuff happening, Disney and Disney plus. Well, let's start with

129
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,000
Speaker 5:  the gadget news of the week. Big Samsung event unpacked 95 or

Speaker 6:  So it was, this is like they do two unpacks every year. And the one

137
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,680
Speaker 6:  is like, here are all the phones that regular people wanna buy. So they're

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,920

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,800
Speaker 6:  what this was. So they announced the Z fold four, which is the phone

144

145
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,560
Speaker 6:  the flip phone. Go on. I'm ready.

146
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,760
Speaker 7:  It folds open it folds open. They

147
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,400
Speaker 6:  Both fold. They do both fold open one folds in one flips, technically. So,

148
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,600
Speaker 6:  sorry, sorry. There's the Z flip four, which is just a flip phone because

149
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,880
Speaker 6:  the clamshell flip phones are coming back. As Neely said, you can, you can

150
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,000
Speaker 6:  scroll and flip scroll and

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,440
Speaker 5:  Flip, maybe it's back.

152
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,680
Speaker 6:  And then there's the Z fold for which is the one that's like a big, long

153
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,080
Speaker 6:  candy bar that opens up sideways into a tablet. And that's like, when people

154
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,840
Speaker 6:  talk about foldable phones, the Z fold is basically the one that everybody

155
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,640
Speaker 6:  talks about. It just like is the foldable phone that exists in the world.

156
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,360
Speaker 5:  I don't know about that. I see more flips. Really? These are so much cheaper.

157
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,440
Speaker 6:  They are a lot cheaper. So yeah, the, the Z fold for, I think is

158
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,240
Speaker 6:  1700 bucks. And the Z flip for is a thousand

159
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,120
Speaker 6:  dollars, which is like, not a lot in the fancy smartphone world, but for

160
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,920
Speaker 6:  the Z flip is for like a foldable phone is kind of cheap, but it's like the

161
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,080
Speaker 6:  same price as an iPhone. But I don't think I've ever seen a Z flip in the

162
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,800
Speaker 6:  wild. Do you see these?

163
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah. For Samsung, I was at the doctor's office. The

164
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,840
Speaker 5:  reception had a Z flip two or three unclear, which one? And I was like, oh

165
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,600
Speaker 5:  my God, you got a Z flip. And she was like, I hate it. Oh no, but instantly

166
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,720
Speaker 5:  no thought why? And she's like, well, I have TMO. Well,

167
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,560
Speaker 5:  there's not good service here. And I was like, well, that's not the phone.

168
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,040
Speaker 5:  Like, do you hate the phone? You like the phone? She's like, oh, also it

169
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,720
Speaker 5:  loses all my text messages. My daughter has an iPhone. She can't text me.

170
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,680
Speaker 5:  And like, we never really talked about the phone. We talked about the right,

171
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,720
Speaker 5:  the universe of feelings that networks and messaging platforms have,

172
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,000
Speaker 5:  which really it's like, what we always talk about. I was

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,800
Speaker 5:  like, oh, you should come on the V cast. But it was like an immediate, like

174
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,360
Speaker 5:  I hate this phone. Like I wish I had an iPhone on like Verizon

175
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,480
Speaker 6:  Fair. Yeah. I mean, somewhere, someone at Samsung is like, none of this is

176
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,320
Speaker 6:  our fault. We're so sorry. Yeah. Take it up with Google,

177
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,320
Speaker 5:  Like 1000%. Right. Like I was like, but do you like the flippy? She's like,

178
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,720
Speaker 5:  yeah, part's fine. But I don't have any service. And I can't text my daughter.

179
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,680
Speaker 5:  Like at some point that stuff is way more important than whether you

180
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,560
Speaker 5:  have like a sky blue, metallic folding phone, which

181
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,800
Speaker 5:  is like, I would be like, that's all I

182
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,680
Speaker 7:  Want. Isn't that? Why like the iPhone does so much better.

183
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,640
Speaker 5:  Right. Cause it has a proprietary messaging survey.

184
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,240
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Like everybody's like, oh, it just works.

185
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,480
Speaker 5:  We'll get to that. It's

186
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,720
Speaker 6:  Coming up. Literally will get the

187
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,600
Speaker 5:  De bone Memorial RCS segment is coming on the verge past.

188
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,920
Speaker 5:  So those are two phones. I will say that the Z fold four is like

189
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,800
Speaker 5:  still ridiculously expensive, right? Yes. It's like $1,800. Yes. And it's

190
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,160
Speaker 5:  a very iterative improvement.

191
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,960
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's like, it's, it's in sort of a weird spot where it's like now

192
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,800
Speaker 6:  the Z fold four, like basically is as good as Samsung's other phones,

193
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,120
Speaker 6:  which sounds like a small thing to say, but it's actually kind of a big deal.

194
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,200
Speaker 6:  Like it has, it has good specs. It has like a slightly less good camera than

195
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,160
Speaker 6:  like the S 22 ultra, which is its, you know, the note replacement super

196
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,920
Speaker 6:  high end 6.8 inch. It's a monster of a phone, but it's like

197
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,920
Speaker 6:  roughly as good as the rest of Samsung's phones, which has not been true

198
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,520
Speaker 6:  of the fold before, it used to have to make like weird sacrifices for,

199
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,680
Speaker 6:  you know, durability. And the camera was a lot less good and they've

200
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,520
Speaker 6:  like slowly but surely brought that stuff up. And now it's like,

201
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,400
Speaker 6:  it's funny that we're to the point where foldable phones are just like iterating

202
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,920
Speaker 6:  every year. But this seems to be where we are. It's like, they're like, yep.

203
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,720
Speaker 6:  We did it. It folds. Now it doesn't break the first time you try to open

204
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Speaker 6:  it. Yeah. Like it used to, so that's good. But then yeah, it's just weird.

205
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,280
Speaker 6:  It's like before anybody even started really using these things in a mainstream

206
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,000
Speaker 6:  way, we're already at like a mature foldable market. It's very strange.

207
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,840
Speaker 7:  I mean it's just Samsung though right?

208
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,720
Speaker 6:  Of one. Yeah, it is. Yeah.

209
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,040
Speaker 7:  And that's because it's, there's still like a little crease when you open

210
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,680
Speaker 7:  it. Right?

211
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The crease doesn't really bother me. Is the

212
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,960
Speaker 7:  Film still there? Like if you remove the film, does it still explode?

213
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,360
Speaker 5:  No. You are not meant to remove the film. I know. I think they've, they

214
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,280
Speaker 5:  they've landed on a treatment of the film that does not suggest it is

215
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,320
Speaker 5:  removable. Right. Excellent. And that is the solve.

216
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,600
Speaker 6:  It no longer looks like a screen protector the way that it used to. Yeah.

217
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,440
Speaker 5:  Rip, but the screen replacements are much cheaper now it's like $29.

218
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,480
Speaker 5:  If you have the Samsung plan, it used to really the like whatever the Samsung

219
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,440
Speaker 5:  center warranty is. So like they've entered into a territory

220
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,480
Speaker 5:  where they're to David's point. They're just normal phones. Yeah. Yeah.

221
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,960
Speaker 5:  And I think especially the flip four, which a thousand dollars it's

222
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,760
Speaker 5:  got flagship specs, it's got an S 22 camera in it, the right

223
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,600
Speaker 5:  processor, a bigger battery. It's like, oh that is kind of

224
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,880
Speaker 5:  like Samsung swag ship phone.

225
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,120
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That's the one I'd get because you can put it in your

226
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,280
Speaker 5:  Pocket, you can put it in your pocket. But I, the full, the fold four still

227
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,200
Speaker 5:  exists is like the monster that will assure the new paradigm of

228
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,800
Speaker 5:  computing. And I think actually all the attention belongs in the flip for

229
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,320
Speaker 7:  Yes.

230
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,000
Speaker 6:  I totally agree. I think the flip for is like what phones should be like,

231
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,480
Speaker 6:  I'm I'm I want my current phone to say the way that it is, but also be smaller

232
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,280
Speaker 6:  and not be annoying when it's sitting on a desk, I wanna be able to close

233
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,600
Speaker 6:  it. That makes me very happy. Yeah. Yeah. Whereas the, like I got in a bunch

234
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,800
Speaker 6:  of trouble cause I wrote this story yesterday about, I just don't really

235
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,720
Speaker 6:  think there is a point to default as a thing it's

236
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,880
Speaker 6:  like, you can have a big phone where you can have a slightly bigger phone.

237
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,800
Speaker 6:  That's also much thicker and way more expensive. Like, can I interest

238
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,160
Speaker 6:  you in that? Like, no, I just, I but then a bunch of people got really mad

239
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,280
Speaker 6:  at me cuz they were like, no, it's, it's a big screen. You don't understand

240
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,320
Speaker 6:  big screens are magic.

241
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But it's an Android tablet. Big screen.

242
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,440
Speaker 7:  Yes. If it was an iPad mini that you folded at half, I would

243
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,360
Speaker 7:  buy it in a heartbeat for less than $2,000. I would probably not

244
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,760
Speaker 7:  buy it actually for $1,800.

245
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,280
Speaker 6:  So it's kind of like, do you want, do you want an iPad mini that folds to

246
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Speaker 6:  be the size of an iPhone? Or do you want an iPhone that folds to be the size

247
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,080
Speaker 6:  of an apple watch? I

248
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,400
Speaker 7:  Want both because they're different things.

249
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:11,760
Speaker 6:  Fair.

250
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,080
Speaker 5:  Wait. Okay. Walk me through the, I want an iPhone that folds into an

251
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,000
Speaker 5:  iPad use case.

252
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,560
Speaker 7:  That's what Dan does with his. So Dan Seifert.

253
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah. He's got a fold

254
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,160
Speaker 7:  Three. Yeah. And he just like sits there and he opens it up and then he

255
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,040
Speaker 7:  watches like all of halo on it. Just because his wife is like, we are

256
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,560
Speaker 7:  not watching that on the TV. Yep. You can watch that as you go to bed at

257
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,480
Speaker 7:  night and that's, that would be my use case. Like I just wanna be able to

258
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:35,960
Speaker 7:  be like having,

259
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,120
Speaker 6:  You know what else you can do that on is every other phone that exists,

260
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,080
Speaker 7:  But big,

261
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,130
Speaker 6:  Not really. It's the, so when you fold out the

262
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,170
Speaker 6:  fold for it is a, it's a 7.6 inch screen. Yeah. Which is like

263
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,810
Speaker 6:  bigger than your phone for sure. Yeah. But is it like

264
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,010
Speaker 6:  life-changing differently, big for

265
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,210
Speaker 7:  Your phone? I'm gonna, so I've got a bunch of purses,

266
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,010
Speaker 6:  Liam. My producer is nodding vigorously at here,

267
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,250
Speaker 6:  Liam, who I would remind you bought a Z fold and then instantly returned

268
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,490
Speaker 7:  Twice.

269
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,050
Speaker 5:  So like not life changing enough. Yeah, exactly. Like life changing as many

270
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:14,450
Speaker 5:  stages.

271
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:19,130
Speaker 7:  But, but you can put it like if you have the fold, you can fold it in half

272
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,810
Speaker 7:  and then you can put it in a smaller purse. Yeah. Yeah. Then you could

273
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,090
Speaker 7:  a regular tablet,

274
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,650
Speaker 5:  But the reason you'd want it to be an iPad. Yeah. Is because then you would

275
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,450
Speaker 5:  get the world of iPad software. Right. And instead what you get is the world

276
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,170
Speaker 5:  of Android tablet software.

277
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,530
Speaker 7:  That's why I don't have one.

278
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,570
Speaker 5:  Okay. Just like, okay. So then walk me through the, I have a regular

279
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,050
Speaker 5:  sized phone that folds into half that size

280
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,050
Speaker 7:  Pockets pockets. A lot of us do not have pockets that like

281
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,730
Speaker 7:  work. I'm wearing some pants today and they work and it's great. You guys

282
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,440
Speaker 7:  didn't have to hear me talk about it because I bought these pants, not yesterday,

283
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,120
Speaker 7:  but anytime you get a pair of pants and you can put your phone in it, it's

284
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,520
Speaker 7:  like a huge event. Like you text your friends and stuff. Oh yeah. And so

285
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Speaker 7:  like having a phone that you don't have to text your friends cuz you got

286
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,880
Speaker 7:  new pants, game changer.

287
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,160
Speaker 5:  Okay. I mean I buy all of it. It just, to me, the, I

288
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,800
Speaker 5:  have effectively stopped using my iPad because my phone is so big.

289
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,840
Speaker 5:  Same. I'm like, there's not a lot that I want jump up to iPad size

290
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,360
Speaker 5:  on. And the last time I did it, I was like, all I'm gonna there. You know,

291
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,320
Speaker 5:  there's a TikTok iPad app. So I was like, all right, like I scroll through

292
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,760
Speaker 5:  this, I'm gonna put this on this iPad. And I was like, oh, TikTok, compresses

293
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,400
Speaker 5:  the video for phones. So this is an objectively worse experience.

294
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,560
Speaker 5:  The video looks

295
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,720
Speaker 7:  Horrible and I will still spend, I had to delete TikTok cuz I would just

296
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,560
Speaker 7:  like open my iPad mini and just be like, whoop.

297
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,680
Speaker 5:  Oh so I didn't try it on a mini. I tried it on like a 9.7 inch

298
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:40,960
Speaker 5:  iPad,

299
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,400
Speaker 7:  Even worse,

300
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,000
Speaker 5:  Even worse. It's like a garbage iPad we had line around

301
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,120
Speaker 7:  And you have to like flip it to the right side. It's terrible. I hate

302
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,800
Speaker 5:  It. Richard,

303
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,840
Speaker 6:  You have spent today talking about the two laptops that you use and

304
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,760
Speaker 6:  the 49 inch monitor that you sit in front of all day. So I feel like you

305
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,200
Speaker 6:  are a person

306
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
Speaker 5:  Who appreciates screen

307
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,000
Speaker 6:  Real estate.

308
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,680
Speaker 9:  I love, I love screen real estate. Not necessarily on my mobile device. Okay.

309
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,480
Speaker 9:  And I'm, I'm fine with it being small. What I would like in a foldable phone

310
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,240
Speaker 9:  is number one. What if it gave me iPad? Like battery life. If I didn't have

311
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,680
Speaker 9:  to charge it every day. Okay.

312
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:10,680
Speaker 6:  Into

313
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,760
Speaker 9:  That you hit dead mark full

314
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,200
Speaker 6:  Do put 'em into the idea

315
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,680
Speaker 9:  Or better yet. If it folded two different ways and it had

316
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,360
Speaker 9:  a keyboard and it was called the Motorola MPX and you would sell me one

317
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,040
Speaker 9:  right now. I would give you all of the money I have for

318
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,360
Speaker 5:  It or the Nokia communicator.

319
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,240
Speaker 9:  Yes. That, that I'm into. But what they're doing, the flip is

320
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,920
Speaker 9:  interesting. I like being able to close my phone and hang up a call. That

321
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,320
Speaker 9:  sounds good.

322
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,520
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Also the, the flip flip, when you close it and you open the

323
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,160
Speaker 5:  camera, the selfie camera, cuz it's got that screen on the front back.

324
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,040
Speaker 5:  There's a screen next to the cameras. It has a name. Yeah. That I'm blanking

325
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,600
Speaker 5:  on, but there's a screen back that becomes their selfie camera. And then

326
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,440
Speaker 5:  you can preview on that screen. And I love the idea of a high

327
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,200
Speaker 5:  quality selfie camera

328
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,280
Speaker 9:  And the way it kind of carries it around its own stand that you can have

329
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,520
Speaker 9:  it mounted. You know, you can have just sitting on the desk like in L shape

330
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,360
Speaker 9:  sort of like, I, I like that idea. Wasn't that like, I don't know. I don't

331
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,440
Speaker 9:  know how good that is in practice, but the idea of it sounds good.

332
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,000
Speaker 7:  Wasn't that the entire thrust of the presentation from Samsung, they were

333
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,080
Speaker 7:  just like, you know, what's cool L shape

334
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,560
Speaker 5:  They're no, but this is, this is like every company that makes anything that

335
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Speaker 5:  can fold is like tent mode.

336
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,040
Speaker 7:  Yes. Where was the tent mode?

337
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,920
Speaker 5:  Like all those like Intel two and ones for the longest sign. Like

338
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,960
Speaker 5:  what you want is a tent

339
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,520
Speaker 7:  Because you're cooking. The

340
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,480
Speaker 5:  Future of computing is a tent shape. We need you to

341
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,040
Speaker 5:  believe this and buy an Intel base too. One convert.

342
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,040
Speaker 9:  I bought the XPS two and one, it folded, I used it intent mode once.

343
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,160
Speaker 9:  Yep. It was bad. It, it overheated the battery life

344
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,560
Speaker 9:  wasn't as good. It was a bad idea.

345
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,960
Speaker 7:  Why did you use it in intent mode?

346
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,080
Speaker 9:  I, I was in the kitchen. You're supposed to be able to use it that way. You

347
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,040
Speaker 9:  should be able to have a recipe up and you can scroll through it with the

348
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,680
Speaker 9:  touchscreen. It's gonna be great. It wasn't great.

349
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,760
Speaker 5:  But now you can, what if you had a smaller phone in tent mode, huh?

350
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,240
Speaker 7:  No, it's El mode. It's they don't do tent mode. So it's a little El mode.

351
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,840
Speaker 7:  So you have to like get down there squint at. Yeah.

352
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,880
Speaker 5:  So it is true that Samsung is like the only mainstream provider, foldable

353
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,840
Speaker 5:  phones in this country. They've got the two like

354
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,920
Speaker 5:  carriers discount, the flip all the time. Like that's the, you

355
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,000
Speaker 5:  can get discounts on the fold, like, but they're mainstream products. Like

356
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,600
Speaker 5:  this is what they're launching. It's funny. Cuz Moto was really remember

357
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,360
Speaker 5:  they did that whole razor stuff with all the influencers and the thing. Yeah.

358
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,640
Speaker 5:  And it didn't flip. And so this week at the same time, Moto

359
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,520
Speaker 5:  has like launched a new razor only in China.

360
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,760
Speaker 6:  And we missed it. This is, this is how like it launched and we didn't notice,

361
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,440
Speaker 5:  They didn't didn't tell us. Yeah. They were like, like

362
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,120
Speaker 5:  a few hours later. Like by the way we launched a new razor in

363
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,800
Speaker 7:  China. Does that like how many phones did they have to sell in the

364
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,440
Speaker 7:  United States? You just be like, no, we're not even gonna tell anybody

365
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,520
Speaker 6:  Six,

366
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,840
Speaker 5:  By the way, the new razor has a flex view mode. So you can open the screen

367
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,760
Speaker 5:  halfway and use it. Yes. This thing kind of just feels like it's

368
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,440
Speaker 5:  a flip. So it has a bigger screen on the front 2.7 inch cover

369
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,560
Speaker 5:  screen. The flip is that's the name of it by the way, the cover screen? Well,

370
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,040
Speaker 5:  the flip is a 1.9 inch because it's bigger. It has like a full

371
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,080
Speaker 5:  notification interface. It's got a widget on here that looks exactly like

372
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,400
Speaker 5:  an I iOS weather widget,

373
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,680
Speaker 5:  but same sort of like 50 megapixel camera with optical stabilization,

374
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,000
Speaker 5:  13 megapixel, ultra wide. It's like this, another flagship phone.

375
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,200
Speaker 5:  It just seems like, it seems like only Samsung

376
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,000
Speaker 5:  is like willing to make this bet and maybe not get market share because

377
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,080
Speaker 5:  they've got market share all the way at the low end and all the competition

378
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,040
Speaker 5:  here is at the low end of the market now.

379
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,320
Speaker 6:  Yes. Yeah.

380
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,560
Speaker 5:  There's just,

381
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,280
Speaker 6:  It's kind of depressing. There's just no upside to trying to pick the

382
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,200
Speaker 6:  fight anywhere else. Like it's, it's just, everybody

383
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,080
Speaker 6:  is set in what they have. And it's like part of the reason I think flip phones

384
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,800
Speaker 6:  are interesting is it feels like most people who are not that interested

385
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,880
Speaker 6:  in like reinventing their phone experience are not gonna go for the

386
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,480
Speaker 6:  phone that folds into a tablet thing. But if it's like a phone that looks

387
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,080
Speaker 6:  and feels like my phone, but I can close it and put it on my desk. Like that's

388
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,640
Speaker 6:  a thing I think people will like intuitively understand and it doesn't blow

389
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,080
Speaker 6:  up my life to use it. So I feel like if I was gonna bet on either one of

390
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,000
Speaker 6:  these to like actually make noise in the like world of phones,

391
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,280
Speaker 6:  kind of across all of the different price points. That's the one I would

392
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,600
Speaker 6:  bet on

393
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,600
Speaker 7:  Is a flip phone, less breakable. Like when you throw it, like if I

394
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,440
Speaker 7:  threw my phone at something like, ah, I'm scared and threw my phone at something,

395
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,120
Speaker 7:  it would shatter. But if I had a flip phone and it was closed and I threw

396
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,240
Speaker 7:  it,

397
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,760
Speaker 5:  I think in general, anything with more moving parts is like more delicate,

398
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,360
Speaker 7:  But the screen is now protected.

399
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,720
Speaker 5:  It's true. The screen is, but the hinge is now, right?

400
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,720
Speaker 6:  So crack land having to use all that, all those crazy new materials to get

401
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,280
Speaker 6:  the screen that folds, like I wouldn't try it

402
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,720
Speaker 5:  Is what I'm saying. Yeah.

403
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,600
Speaker 7:  Like the that's I guess I can't get a flip phone because the urge to do that,

404
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,240
Speaker 5:  I'm throwing it.

405
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,040
Speaker 6:  You need to buy one of those, but also a Nokia 33 10 that you can just hook

406
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,840
Speaker 6:  across the room anytime you need to. Exactly.

407
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,680
Speaker 7:  It's a test. Yeah. This would be a great video.

408
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,680
Speaker 5:  These are basically only renders that motor release about this thing, but

409
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,080
Speaker 5:  yo, this phone looks great.

410
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,560
Speaker 7:  It's got like a real,

411
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,200
Speaker 5:  This is

412
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,600
Speaker 6:  The thing. Like I get flip phones. I want one.

413
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,280
Speaker 5:  I can't can't should have one.

414
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,640
Speaker 6:  I should

415
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,600
Speaker 5:  Certainly can't have this one, but I want one. Well, this is the thing like

416
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,560
Speaker 5:  we should talk about. This is the deed bone Memorial RCS segment. So

417
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,800
Speaker 5:  Google this week full on shaming blitz against apple,

418
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,040
Speaker 5:  like by name, campaign. It's time for apple

419
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,040
Speaker 5:  to fix texting for der did his first like Google executive

420
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,000
Speaker 5:  tweet. People were like, you work for Google now.

421
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,800
Speaker 5:  We love you man. But like, Google's like, it's Apple's fault,

422
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,280
Speaker 5:  like full on this. Isn't like a carrier thing. We haven't gotta push it.

423
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,800
Speaker 5:  It's like apple needs to support RCS to improve texting. Here's all the things

424
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,120
Speaker 5:  that are broken. It's not just screen bubbles. But then there was another

425
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,960
Speaker 5:  part where like also the green bubbles are hard to read. Ooh, it's

426
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,160
Speaker 5:  true.

427
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,560
Speaker 7:  It's true. But

428
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,560
Speaker 5:  Ooh, fundamentally, that's not the problem. My

429
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,280
Speaker 5:  theory has always been that foldables are because they're a different

430
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,200
Speaker 5:  hardware form factor. They can command interest. Like I've probably said

431
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,280
Speaker 5:  this on this show a hundred times, things that look different, always get

432
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,800
Speaker 5:  more interest than yes. Things that look the same with slightly different

433
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,240
Speaker 5:  software. Right? Just true. So like, it looks really different. So it commands

434
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,230
Speaker 5:  your attention. And then people get to the point where they're like, wait,

435
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,590
Speaker 5:  I can't text my daughter, wait, it doesn't work. Like my iPhone that I'm

436
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,430
Speaker 5:  really comfortable with. Yep. Wait, I don't they'll have airplay like whatever

437
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,230
Speaker 5:  bits and bobs, the ecosystem that you're aware of suddenly don't appear for

438
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,150
Speaker 5:  you. And you're like, ah, it's too hard to use. I'm just stick with this

439
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,750
Speaker 5:  iPhone. This

440
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,310
Speaker 6:  Is why people don't switch. Cuz it's just not worth the effort anymore. Like

441
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,270
Speaker 6:  the things are they're close enough, but not exactly the same. And it's just

442
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,070
Speaker 6:  not worth the effort to switch.

443
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,830
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But a hundred percent. Do you think that if I went to RCS,

444
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,630
Speaker 5:  like this is what I think the limit of my theory is being tested. Right?

445
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,030
Speaker 5:  That we've talked about iMessage lock in on the show a million times. And

446
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,510
Speaker 5:  we've talked about people like looking at new kinds of hardware, form factors

447
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,070
Speaker 5:  a million times. If you give them a new hardware form factor and apple goes

448
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,750
Speaker 5:  to RCS, do people switch to Android in any

449
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,430
Speaker 5:  meaningful way? Or is all the other stuff just pure lock in?

450
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,470
Speaker 7:  No, because you still need iMessage. Like RCS. Isn't gonna fix all the

451
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,870
Speaker 7:  problems. It'll fix some of the problems.

452
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:10,310
Speaker 5:  It'll fix group text, it'll fix picture messaging. It'll it'll fix a lot

453
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,510
Speaker 5:  of things.

454
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,350
Speaker 7:  The little when, when somebody says congratulations and you suddenly get

455
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,470
Speaker 7:  fireworks on your phone, it won't fix that. People will be so upset.

456
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,550
Speaker 5:  I mean, Google can add a, I mean, that's just like recognizing one word.

457
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,790
Speaker 5:  Like I feel like there's enough AI inside of Google to be like, can you detect

458
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,790
Speaker 5:  the word? Congratulations. Like the, the,

459
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,750
Speaker 6:  The tap back thing is the perfect example of that. Right? Cause it used to

460
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,190
Speaker 6:  be, if you were on a group, chat with anybody on Android and you would do

461
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,190
Speaker 6:  the like tap back thing and hit love, it would be like, you know, so and

462
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,110
Speaker 6:  so loved. And then just quote your message. And that was a horrible nightmare.

463
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,910
Speaker 6:  Fix that. Right? So there's like, that's the same kind of thing they could,

464
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,840
Speaker 6:  they could solve some of that stuff. But no, I cannot imagine the answer

465
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,920
Speaker 6:  is yes. To your question. Like RCS does not

466
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,910
Speaker 6:  change enough to really matter. Like I think

467
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,750
Speaker 6:  what, what RCS does is make Android better. It makes like

468
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,990
Speaker 6:  being an Android owner in an iPhone world better. It doesn't make

469
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,230
Speaker 6:  it doesn't change anything about being an iPhone owner, which is, I think

470
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,950
Speaker 6:  why apple doesn't really care and it

471
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,510
Speaker 6:  doesn't change enough to make a meaningful difference to people. I don't

472
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:12,630
Speaker 6:  think.

473
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,710
Speaker 5:  Right. Cause of all the other stuff.

474
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,670
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's like I'm people stay on iPhones because they've paid for apps.

475
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,550
Speaker 6:  They use like platform specific things. They're they like airplay. They

476
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,350
Speaker 6:  like know where the browser is. Like how the notification

477
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,550
Speaker 6:  shade works. It's like the, the thing, the muscle memory of using a phone

478
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,470
Speaker 6:  is so intense.

479
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,990
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They love the feeling of getting an Android feature two years later

480
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,670
Speaker 5:  and then saying apple invented it. People love

481
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,750
Speaker 6:  That. Oh it's so the best

482
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,790
Speaker 5:  Hundred and hundred 20 yard screens. Amazing Tim cook invented

483
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:40,950
Speaker 5:  that

484
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,310
Speaker 6:  Games that actually work. Those are fun. Love those.

485
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,750
Speaker 5:  You know what? My current lock-in feature is, it's not true. Lock in. People

486
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,710
Speaker 5:  are gonna quibble with me though. I'm like saying lock in. It's a thing that

487
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,590
Speaker 5:  I'm like, oh, I can't get this up. When you copy something on an iPhone

488
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,470
Speaker 5:  and paste it on your Mac, like Match's, it's like, oh, oh, you should just

489
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,270
Speaker 5:  hold me tight. Just I'm gonna just open the garden walls and then bring

490
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,830
Speaker 5:  the gate down and pad lock. 'em I'm staying right here.

491
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,670
Speaker 6:  He looks weird about that though, is that at least in my experience works

492
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,350
Speaker 6:  perfectly. And it's amazing. And every other thing that apple does where

493
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,030
Speaker 6:  they're like try to move stuff between your device is garbage, right.

494
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,990
Speaker 5:  Apples moving like text.

495
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,150
Speaker 6:  But the thing where it's like, I have a browser tab open and, and the little

496
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,270
Speaker 6:  thing pops up on the Mac and it's like, would you like to open this? And

497
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,150
Speaker 6:  I say, sure. And it's like, how about it? Different webpage where it's

498
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,710
Speaker 6:  like, I, I turn my headphones on. And it's like, do you wanna connect to

499
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,030
Speaker 6:  all of your devices except the one that's currently ringing. Yeah. And it's

500
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,030
Speaker 6:  like, but then the copy and paste thing is magical.

501
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,670
Speaker 5:  The copy and pasting works. I will say the, what do you want to answer your

502
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,590
Speaker 5:  phone on intelligence? It's like rival Siri

503
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:45,310
Speaker 5:  in terms of great idea. Completely useless execution. Yes.

504
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,430
Speaker 5:  It's like what, what if everything in your house was written? It's like,

505
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,030
Speaker 5:  what if just my phone was ringing, but then you can't turn off. Cuz he had

506
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,350
Speaker 5:  turn off this stuff. I could talk about this all day.

507
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,270
Speaker 6:  We should finish Samsung though, because there, there were a couple of other

508
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,110
Speaker 6:  things. The now speaking of headphones, there was the, the galaxy buds, two

509
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,910
Speaker 6:  pro people loved the galaxy buds. They do. There were like an deeply

510
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,150
Speaker 6:  underrated set of headphones I think. And these are

511
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,910
Speaker 6:  230 bucks, which is, I think $30, more expensive

512
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,550
Speaker 6:  than they used to be. But by all accounts seem to be very good.

513
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,110
Speaker 5:  What's the Bigsby integration. Like

514
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,030
Speaker 7:  That question. That one person.

515
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,710
Speaker 5:  Yeah. John BBY likes big one for me,

516
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,350
Speaker 6:  Bigsby appears zero times in our story that galaxy,

517
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,590
Speaker 5:  I think BPE appears zero times in Samsung's presentation.

518
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,870
Speaker 6:  You where said yes, Samsung, studiously avoids the word Android every time.

519
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,030
Speaker 6:  Which I find very funny. Yeah. And I think this is true in all of these,

520
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:44,000
Speaker 6:  like apple says Siri less and less every time. And, and Samsung says

521
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,880
Speaker 6:  Bixby less and less every time. Yeah. And Amazon just says Alexa,

522
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,400
Speaker 6:  more times every, every time you turn around, are

523
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,800
Speaker 7:  We moving away from where they all were? Like, we have to compete and show

524
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,840
Speaker 7:  our stupid AI digital assistant is the best one.

525
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:58,840
Speaker 6:  I think. So

526
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,560
Speaker 7:  Are we finally past that point? Well

527
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,760
Speaker 6:  They all, now they all now treat them as like, like if you ask apple, Siri

528
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,960
Speaker 6:  is not like a voice assistant. It's just like a generalized intelligence.

529
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,440
Speaker 6:  And they're like, oh thing, this is what they say. They're like the thing,

530
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,840
Speaker 6:  when you pull down their notification shade and it recommends which apps

531
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,480
Speaker 6:  you should open, they're like, that's Siri. It's like, no, it's not. That's

532
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,200
Speaker 6:  my phone. Like I don't, I don't care. We can cool about what you, what it's

533
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,120
Speaker 6:  named. But like Siri is the thing that searches the web. When I ask

534
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,480
Speaker 6:  for a timer, like that's, what's serious

535
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,320
Speaker 9:  Remembering which app I opened the most is not artificial intelligence. That's

536
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,800
Speaker 9:  just account of

537
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:30,800
Speaker 6:  It's nothing.

538
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,480
Speaker 6:  But yeah. So, okay. So there were the buds, which I believe Chris Welch is

539
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,000
Speaker 6:  reviewing and I suspect we'll turn out to be very good. Cuz the galaxy buds

540
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,480
Speaker 6:  have been very good for a while. And then there was the galaxy watch five

541
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,080
Speaker 6:  and watch five pro, which are, I think

542
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,120
Speaker 6:  280 bucks and 450 bucks respectively. And the big thing here was more

543
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,640
Speaker 6:  battery life.

544
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,440
Speaker 6:  I actually think the galaxy watch is super fascinating because like, especially

545
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,960
Speaker 6:  now that they've gone back to like working with Google and doing S stuff

546
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,400
Speaker 6:  like the, the watch for bio account was like really good. Yeah. And people

547
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,640
Speaker 6:  really liked it. And it was like the first thing that was like, okay, if

548
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,600
Speaker 6:  you are an Android person and want something kind of like the apple watch

549
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,440
Speaker 6:  here is something kind of like the apple watch and the five pro just seemed

550
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,800
Speaker 6:  or the five and the five pro seemed to just like push that slightly forward.

551
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,240
Speaker 6:  Like more sensors, more health stuff. Cause everybody's in on health stuff.

552
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,160
Speaker 6:  The watch pro I think is enormous. It's

553
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,960
Speaker 5:  Enormous. And it has like a touch bezel, right?

554
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. They both do

555
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,880
Speaker 7:  45 millimeters. That's like, that's a big,

556
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,520
Speaker 7:  chunky, yeah. Chunk. It's big way. Yeah. I used to have, I used to have like

557
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,120
Speaker 7:  a 42 millimeter. My dad gave me and I would wear it to soccer practice in

558
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,080
Speaker 7:  like sixth grade and it just took my entire wrist up. It

559
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,360
Speaker 7:  just looked like I was wearing a large bracelet, like a cuff bracelet. It

560
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,760
Speaker 7:  was great.

561
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,640
Speaker 6:  You said phone on your wrist basically.

562
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,280
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I could stop bullets with that wrist watch,

563
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,800
Speaker 6:  But yeah. And I think especially like this is coming and there's presumably

564
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,640
Speaker 6:  gonna be a new apple watch soon and the pixel watch is coming and it's like

565
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,520
Speaker 6:  this, this is like a cool moment where it kind of felt like everybody was

566
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,640
Speaker 6:  giving up on smart watches except for apple. And now it sort of feels like

567
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,760
Speaker 6:  there's, there's real stuff out here happening again, which is cool.

568
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I will say that the 45 millimeter size, I'm just looking at our photos

569
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,120
Speaker 5:  of this on our wrist. It's like

570
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,480
Speaker 7:  The one on Allison's wrist.

571
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,920
Speaker 5:  Monstrously. Huge

572
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,600
Speaker 7:  Watch. You can put like multiple fingers. I think you could probably put

573
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,600
Speaker 7:  her whole other hand between that's just huge.

574
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,680
Speaker 6:  Oh, ne I have great news for you. Vong who wrote about the, the

575
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,840
Speaker 6:  watches rights and I quote after months of waiting Samsung galaxy watch

576
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,120
Speaker 6:  owners can finally use Google assistant on their devices. Don't panic, Bixby

577
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,440
Speaker 6:  lovers, Samsung promises all five of you. That Bixby is still available on

578
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,200
Speaker 6:  the watch. Five and pro. Yes. So

579
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:38,680
Speaker 5:  Look, if you

580
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,680
Speaker 6:  Eli and four others

581
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,400
Speaker 5:  Who doesn't want, it's a dog with shoes, he's just here to help you out.

582
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,400
Speaker 5:  Remember when that pitch was like big people just do settings for you. And

583
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,360
Speaker 5:  that was the, the idea that like our settings are so complicated that

584
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,840
Speaker 5:  an AI dog will help you go through the settings.

585
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:55,480
Speaker 5:  Bluetooth

586
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,320
Speaker 7:  Rich is just shaking his head over here.

587
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,040
Speaker 5:  Don't you have an Android phone. Do you have BBY?

588
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,520
Speaker 9:  I do not have BBY. I have, unfortunately never had a modern Samsung

589
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:09,400
Speaker 9:  phone. The last Samsung phone, I think was the galaxy S two epic 4g.

590
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,760
Speaker 9:  Oh yeah. If I'm not getting the

591
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,800
Speaker 5:  Epic 4g touch two.

592
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,040
Speaker 9:  Yes, it was, it was a wonderful phone, but no, it did not have

593
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,120
Speaker 9:  any AI or any dogs wearing shoes

594
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,640
Speaker 6:  Missing out.

595
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,200
Speaker 5:  I think Samsung should have just taken our lead and branded Bixby is like

596
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,920
Speaker 5:  helpful dog Butler and shoes and like straight

597
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,440
Speaker 5:  gone Clippy with it. And like, every time you push the button, like is

598
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,000
Speaker 5:  BBY.

599
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,560
Speaker 7:  That would be branding. People would talk about that.

600
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:38,160
Speaker 5:  They did. I did. I made it up and then we all talked about it.

601
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,920
Speaker 7:  No, but I'm thinking like Clippy, like, like the wider realm

602
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:43,760
Speaker 7:  would the

603
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,680
Speaker 5:  Realm, the realm, the realm, the realm of Samsung.

604
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,920
Speaker 7:  Yeah. People would talk about it. They'd be on TikTok all the time. BFE dog.

605
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,640
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Be like a character would be a meme. Get on this. Samsung.

606
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,720
Speaker 5:  I've been telling them for years. They won't. I know that they're aware.

607
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,520
Speaker 5:  It's your IP inside of Samsung. They're aware that I think it's a dog with

608
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,840
Speaker 5:  shoes and like, just like turn, like what do you have to lose?

609
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,280
Speaker 5:  Stop. Three people are using this thing and you're giving up to Google assistant.

610
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,040
Speaker 5:  Come on, just go full cartoon dog.

611
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,520
Speaker 5:  People should not put me in charge of any type companies. I think that should

612
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,080
Speaker 5:  be very obvious.

613
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,000
Speaker 7:  I disagree. I want the dog.

614
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Speaker 5:  Everyone wants the dog. It's very obvious

615
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,720
Speaker 6:  When you own the green bay Packers, you can make it, you

616
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,200
Speaker 5:  Should roll own only two shares the green bay pack Packers concern,

617
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,360
Speaker 9:  And then we'll know what to do with our Pinterest page.

618
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:34,080
Speaker 5:  We'll figure out our Pinterest page. All right. We should take a break

619
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,920
Speaker 6:  Before we do. Yeah. One thing. So we, we're gonna talk more about

620
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,280
Speaker 6:  Samsung and foldables and gadgets and why the internet

621
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,560
Speaker 6:  is mad at me about big screens on next Wednesday's show.

622
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,480
Speaker 6:  And if you have questions, call the verge hotline, which is 8, 6, 6 verge

623
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,400
Speaker 6:  one one, which is 8, 6, 6 8 3 7 4 3 1 1, but

624
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,000
Speaker 6:  it's just verge one, one. Don't worry about it and call us and ask us all

625
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,920
Speaker 6:  your Samsung and foldable and phone questions. And we'll get to a bunch of

626
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,400
Speaker 6:  'em next week.

627
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:04,560
Speaker 5:  Tell us your big speed stories. Yes. Call us and be like one time.

628
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,600
Speaker 5:  I couldn't figure out how to turn on a feature on my Samsung

629
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,720
Speaker 5:  phone. And I asked Bixby to do it and BBY helped. I

630
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,200
Speaker 5:  just want to hear one story like this.

631
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,320
Speaker 6:  And if you have a drawing of a dog with shoes named Bigsby.

632
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:17,960
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah, please,

633
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,840
Speaker 6:  Please send it. Oh yeah. Eli reckless on Twitter. We all need to,

634
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,240
Speaker 5:  We'll just do a whole run of them on our TikTok. It'll be great. All right.

635
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,440
Speaker 5:  We're gonna take a break. We can come back. Richard's gonna tell us what's

636
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,440
Speaker 5:  going on with Disney in the stream war we'll right back.

637
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,600
Speaker 3:  Hey, I'm Sam Sanders and I host a show called into it.

638
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,720
Speaker 3:  It is a weekly show where we obsess about the culture

639
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,080
Speaker 3:  that matters like revisiting the day when Beyonce

640
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,880
Speaker 3:  dropped her self-titled album in 2013, by

641
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,360
Speaker 3:  surprise.

642
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,600
Speaker 10:  And then we come out and the world is

643
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,720
Speaker 10:  totally a light in a different way because this album

644
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,520
Speaker 10:  has dropped

645
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,960
Speaker 3:  And viewing Beyonce, not just as a musician, but

646
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,560
Speaker 3:  as a business executive

647
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,680
Speaker 10:  People talk about Ford. They talk about Nike.

648
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,920
Speaker 10:  They talk about Coke and Pepsi, and they should talk about

649
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,560
Speaker 10:  Beyonce

650
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,640
Speaker 3:  Or will deep dive into why the internet loves

651
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,520
Speaker 3:  a 24 movies. Can you recall Swiss army

652
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,200
Speaker 3:  man played by Harry Potter? Yes.

653
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,320
Speaker 11:  Played by Harry Potter. And they realized that in the era of the internet,

654
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,280
Speaker 11:  a movie about a farting Corps sells itself

655
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,760
Speaker 3:  Into it from vulture new episodes, every Thursday,

656
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,920
Speaker 3:  subscribe, wherever you get your podcasts.

657
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,800
Speaker 12:  I'm Alex Heath and I'm co-hosting land of the giants. This season,

658
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,880
Speaker 12:  meta the company formally known as Facebook so far. We've

659
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,200
Speaker 12:  told the story of mark Zuckerberg's journey to reaching billions of users

660
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,120
Speaker 12:  from the creation of the newsfeed, to the acquisition of Instagram,

661
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,600
Speaker 12:  but such massive scale that comes at a price in our

662
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,320
Speaker 12:  upcoming episodes. We'll examine how the company has had to grapple with

663
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,160
Speaker 12:  the uncomfortable side of its power, from how to reckon with former

664
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,520
Speaker 12:  president Donald Trump.

665
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,240
Speaker 13:  I think mark in the end felt that if you're gonna start

666
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,440
Speaker 13:  saying that heads of government, can't threaten to deploy force

667
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,280
Speaker 13:  to restore order, that that sets a really quite a virus,

668
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:21,960
Speaker 13:  impressive

669
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,160
Speaker 12:  To the harms, its own technology amplifies

670
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,400
Speaker 14:  Borderline harmful sensational content fundamentally does

671
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,240
Speaker 14:  better. You know, under user engagement

672
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,760
Speaker 12:  Will Zuckerberg's high stakes pivot to building the metaverse work.

673
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,520
Speaker 12:  And if it does, what does that mean for all of us

674
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,600
Speaker 12:  follow land of the giants, wherever you listen to hear new episodes, every

675
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,040
Speaker 12:  Wednesday

676
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,810
Speaker 5:  We're back Richard Rich, RJ

677
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,530
Speaker 5:  have many Nicks, Rick dog

678
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,090
Speaker 5:  Disney airings this week. Good news, bad news. I was on CBC today and they

679
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,010
Speaker 5:  were like, stock is up, which means like good news. Yeah. I dunno why they

680
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,890
Speaker 5:  let me talk about stocks. It's great. But stock is

681
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:17,690
Speaker 5:  up PAC, you know, he is one of the bobs. Yeah. Oh Bob.

682
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,610
Speaker 5:  He looked as happy as he could, which is like a medium amount.

683
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,290
Speaker 5:  Happy like you got that theme park money now, man. Yeah. Yeah. So

684
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,570
Speaker 5:  they're doing great subscribers. They have more subscribers now in Netflix

685
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:32,730
Speaker 5:  Disney, 2 21 around the world, Netflix two 20 disclosure. The ver

686
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,330
Speaker 5:  made a Netflix show, which I'm the EP box media makes shows with all of

687
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,000
Speaker 5:  these companies. Comcast is a minority investor and fucks me whatever

688
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:42,680
Speaker 7:  Media,

689
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,960
Speaker 5:  If you've listened to the show, you know that it doesn't work. The money

690
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,160
Speaker 5:  has not dissuaded us.

691
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,120
Speaker 5:  Disney's a weird place. Like they're raising prices where the shopper are

692
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,040
Speaker 5:  in. Great. I gotta call out bluey season three, just hit Disney plus, which

693
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,320
Speaker 5:  means if you have a child, you are never unsubscribing, but it's a weird

694
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,080
Speaker 5:  moment for them.

695
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,120
Speaker 9:  The question of who the, of whether or not this is good news, I think depends

696
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,960
Speaker 9:  on whether or not you're a Disney investor or a Disney plus customer. If

697
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,520
Speaker 9:  you're a Disney investor, great news, they have more customers. They have

698
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,240
Speaker 9:  a plan to make more money. They have a plan to be profitable on streaming

699
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,320
Speaker 9:  by 2024. Maybe these are all the things you love to hear. If

700
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,680
Speaker 9:  you are a Disney customer, I have bad news. You are the reason that they

701
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,600
Speaker 9:  will be profitable by 2024. Cause they're raising prices on everything

702
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,080
Speaker 9:  they they've discovered that people will pay for. I don't know, Marvel movies

703
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,920
Speaker 9:  for all of the Disney kids stuff. People will love to watch the, the

704
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,840
Speaker 9:  properties that they have. They will pay for it. Maybe they won't pay for

705
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,360
Speaker 9:  Netflix if they keep raising the price, but they will keep playing for Disney

706
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,000
Speaker 9:  every single time. It's great news for Disney and they're taking advantage

707
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,320
Speaker 9:  of it.

708
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,240
Speaker 7:  Well, it's still cheaper than Netflix too. And like, I think

709
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,800
Speaker 7:  a big part of this is they care about these bundles. These bundles are really

710
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,440
Speaker 7:  actually good deals. Like I looked at the bundles and I was like, oh, that's

711
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,360
Speaker 7:  what I'm gonna do because you can get the Disney bundle with Disney

712
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:57,760
Speaker 7:  plus

713
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,080
Speaker 5:  Hulu. Is that with ads or without

714
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,960
Speaker 7:  Both of 'em without ads. Okay. ESPN plus with ads. Sure, sure.

715
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,240
Speaker 7:  For 20 bucks. And that basically, if who cares about ESPN

716
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,240
Speaker 7:  plus I'm sorry to you and my brother that's and I guess

717
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,360
Speaker 7:  rookies.

718
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,560
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You're actually podcasting with three ESPN plus

719
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,920
Speaker 7:  Subscribers. So, well then this is a great deal for you guys, cuz I'm over

720
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,680
Speaker 7:  here being like, wow, I don't care about that. That means I'm getting both

721
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,760
Speaker 7:  of these services. I do use for $10,

722
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,600
Speaker 9:  But that's the pitch is that they can tie together all of these things. They

723
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,920
Speaker 9:  cover everybody. Yeah. Whoever you are, they have some stuff that's and that

724
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,760
Speaker 9:  bundle's going to be a pretty good deal. They've really recreated the parts

725
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,000
Speaker 9:  of the cable bundle that people wanted at a cheaper

726
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,920
Speaker 7:  Price and at the same price that Netflix, premier bundle or

727
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,040
Speaker 7:  premier just service.

728
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,800
Speaker 9:  And, and if you're, if you're looking at that versus Netflix and you're looking

729
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,280
Speaker 9:  at what you get and you're, you're thinking I'm going to pick one, you're

730
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,640
Speaker 9:  probably going to pick the Disney one.

731
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,640
Speaker 7:  If you are one of the people who's spending $20 a month on Netflix, I am

732
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,520
Speaker 7:  one of them. I was gonna say same, same. But if you're one of those people,

733
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,440
Speaker 7:  who's like, Ooh, do I want this bundle? Or do I want Netflix? And

734
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,400
Speaker 7:  you chose Netflix, please. I mean, don't call me. But like, well

735
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,200
Speaker 5:  There's a number they can call.

736
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,240
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Call, call that number

737
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,400
Speaker 5:  Six, ver one, one just hit the number there it is.

738
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,880
Speaker 7:  Tell us why I knowing you're doing that.

739
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,040
Speaker 5:  So here's what I say. The ESPN plus thing is like, it is valuable in very

740
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,800
Speaker 5:  short windows, right? Cause it's not really ESPN. However, the

741
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,920
Speaker 5:  world Excel championships were recently broadcast. This is a true story.

742
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,200
Speaker 5:  You can watch the money ESPN plus in football season, weird right

743
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:30,080
Speaker 5:  stuff, NFL prime time, which is like the best NFL clip

744
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,560
Speaker 5:  show that happens at the end of every day, before the Sunday night game,

745
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,000
Speaker 5:  end of every Sunday, before the Sunday night game, ESPN doesn't have the

746
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,800
Speaker 5:  rights to broadcast it because NBC has the rights

747
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,120
Speaker 5:  to all highlights on broadcast on Sundays, but they got

748
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,880
Speaker 5:  the rights to stream highlights. So it's on ESPN plus.

749
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,520
Speaker 5:  So like that alone is worth it for that one chunk of time, time. Do you,

750
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,120
Speaker 7:  Do you like, what about the actual games?

751
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,680
Speaker 5:  Right? You're what you're doing during the games on a Sunday snapping

752
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,920
Speaker 5:  you're in the dull roar of a football game,

753
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,680
Speaker 9:  Fan crying.

754
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:03,720
Speaker 6:  It's true.

755
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,560
Speaker 5:  And then you wake up and you, while you, I dinner,

756
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,840
Speaker 7:  That's not how we do it in, in Texas. Like that's like a three hour event.

757
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,760
Speaker 7:  If I call my dad at any point during a Cowboys game, he gets

758
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,920
Speaker 7:  so mad. So I do it multiple times and then like, oh, I'm sorry. I forgot

759
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,600
Speaker 7:  the game was still on. Yeah. I know it's at least three hours.

760
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,080
Speaker 5:  But like ESPN has just figured out how to, it's definitely three hours. If

761
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,320
Speaker 5:  you call me at any point during hackers game or Richard during lion's game,

762
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,720
Speaker 5:  there's a lot, there's a lot of screaming

763
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,480
Speaker 6:  Are awful. You can call me. It's fine.

764
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,800
Speaker 5:  Okay. But like they have like very cleverly found their

765
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,960
Speaker 5:  way through its this like highlights rights problem and added value to the

766
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,720
Speaker 5:  streaming product. Yeah. Even though it's only for like however many months

767
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,600
Speaker 5:  of the year and they're kind of doing that around the line with

768
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,480
Speaker 5:  sports. Right. Or they're kind of doing that down the line with sports where

769
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,280
Speaker 5:  it's like, they're adding value to cable subscription. Right. But

770
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,120
Speaker 5:  it's still like, it's only valuable. I would never pay for that. OnOne right.

771
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,240
Speaker 5:  If something that comes in a bundle with Hulu and that's what I'm saying,

772
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,200
Speaker 5:  plus this is the greatest value out of all time.

773
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,360
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Like this is, I think it's just a really good value. So everybody's

774
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,120
Speaker 7:  complaining rightfully that that they've raised prices. But also they said,

775
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,920
Speaker 7:  when they launched the service, they were gonna be raising prices. They're

776
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,680
Speaker 7:  like, no, these prices won't last. And they didn't. They raised it like what

777
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,040
Speaker 7:  two years

778
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,200
Speaker 9:  Later they said almost explicitly that they were planning to lose money for

779
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,520
Speaker 9:  the first few years. And then they, when they have the plans to become profitable,

780
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,800
Speaker 9:  that they would raise prices. And that's, that's what they're doing. They

781
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,440
Speaker 9:  raised the price on ESPN last month, they announced that ESPN plus the price

782
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,160
Speaker 9:  raise there on the standalone plan. And now the bundles are getting a little

783
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,320
Speaker 9:  bit, a bit more expensive. They've also been talking about bringing about

784
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,320
Speaker 9:  how you can get full ESPN on streaming. Yeah. More openly than

785
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,480
Speaker 9:  ever.

786
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,560
Speaker 7:  So that'll

787
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,160
Speaker 9:  Be clearly that comes someday. Now that's probably going to come with

788
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,480
Speaker 9:  charging more money. But, but we're looking at it. I

789
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,920
Speaker 6:  Would say the, the only thing that surprised me about this was that Disney

790
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,960
Speaker 6:  just kind of did it all at once. I feel like the thing we've seen with the

791
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,640
Speaker 6:  streaming companies over the years is they all just like raised their prices,

792
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,240
Speaker 6:  a dollar at a time. And like, hope you don't notice. Like Netflix basically

793
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,560
Speaker 6:  raises its prices every three months. But Disney has experience. You're not

794
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:01,800
Speaker 6:  gonna notice

795
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,600
Speaker 9:  Disney knows something about trying to do this. That I think maybe Netflix

796
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,800
Speaker 9:  is learning like, like Disney has sold bundles. They, they have changed pricing

797
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,920
Speaker 9:  so many times they they've got, they have an advertising business that actually

798
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,720
Speaker 9:  works Netflix. Not yet. So, so they're not learning

799
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,560
Speaker 9:  on the fly with these things and they kind of know which buttons they can

800
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,160
Speaker 9:  press and how hard

801
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,840
Speaker 6:  That's fair. And it does seem like, like we talk about the, the, like who's

802
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,280
Speaker 6:  the zero on the go 90 scale.

803
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,480
Speaker 6:  I think it's

804
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,600
Speaker 7:  It's Disney. Yeah.

805
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,480
Speaker 6:  Like Marvel alone is like,

806
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,800
Speaker 5:  No. Yeah. But Marvel's real shaky lately. There's no guarantee

807
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,720
Speaker 5:  if they don't make better movies than they've been making.

808
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,760
Speaker 5:  Like there's no guarantee that the next phases will be sticky.

809
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:46,480
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I mean, right. Marvel is like in a weird place, cuz it is this big

810
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,160
Speaker 7:  behemoth. It, it does still make a ton of money. Even though the films are

811
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,040
Speaker 7:  getting worse and worse, like accepted. That was a really good movie.

812
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,120
Speaker 7:  Go watch it if you haven't, but it's still a huge franchise for

813
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,800
Speaker 7:  them. And they've got star wars and they have everything Disney's ever made

814
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,800
Speaker 7:  and they have everything's Fox is ever made. So they've got what the

815
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,520
Speaker 7:  Simpsons they've got all of the princess movies. I'm so

816
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,000
Speaker 7:  sorry. The Disney princess movies, whatever you wanna call them.

817
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:13,880
Speaker 7:  Like they've

818
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,680
Speaker 6:  Got all the Pixar stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Mean the library is unbe.

819
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,520
Speaker 7:  Yeah. They have like, they have all, most of the IP, right? Like Warner

820
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,080
Speaker 7:  brothers is, is recognized that they have IP and they think it's 90 day fiance.

821
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:24,800
Speaker 7:  That's weird.

822
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,680
Speaker 5:  But so the difference, like that's really weird. The

823
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,880
Speaker 6:  90 day fiance universe

824
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,240
Speaker 5:  Alone, it's, it's real right

825
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,400
Speaker 7:  Up there with it if you're not in it.

826
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,440
Speaker 5:  So actually I think the difference is that HBO still

827
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,520
Speaker 5:  programs itself like a TV network. Right? Right. Like there's a new season

828
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,720
Speaker 5:  of something really high end that comes out in a regular

829
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,200
Speaker 7:  Case. No, doing that too. Like Disney

830
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,840
Speaker 5:  Plus Disney's like we farted out another star wars thing. Do you want to

831
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,040
Speaker 5:  live?

832
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:47,680
Speaker 6:  We

833
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,680
Speaker 9:  Started the show and you were talking about what is that? The beast? Yeah.

834
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,840
Speaker 9:  On FX, on a

835
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,800
Speaker 5:  Hulu, the bear, the bear, the best, the beast.

836
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,520
Speaker 5:  I'm the that's that's like FX on Hulu. Like that's a TV network that

837
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,880
Speaker 5:  went to Hulu like Disney plus the app is not quite programming.

838
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,920
Speaker 7:  Plus is very much programming. Like they're doing it. They, they specifically

839
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,160
Speaker 7:  are moving shows around. So they have like a night that you're watching Disney

840
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:14,160
Speaker 7:  plus. So you're watching your star wars and your Marvel overlapped. And you're

841
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,760
Speaker 7:  just tucking in for the night. They're like, that is very much part of their

842
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,680
Speaker 7:  plan. And I think it's pulled from the Hulu, ABC like realm. And

843
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,480
Speaker 7:  I think they're doing it better than HBO max.

844
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,640
Speaker 6:  I think I agree with that. But, but the other thing Disney has done really

845
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,560
Speaker 6:  well is integrate that stuff with an app that

846
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,800
Speaker 6:  shows you old things like yes. And this, this has always been the problem

847
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,440
Speaker 6:  that like Amazon has had where Amazon has this massive library of stuff that

848
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,320
Speaker 6:  they just absolutely refuse to show you. Yeah. And instead they're like,

849
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:45,400
Speaker 6:  would you like to watch Jack Ryan? And you're like, no. And they're like,

850
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,480
Speaker 6:  ah, well we don't have anything else for you. Like yeah.

851
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,200
Speaker 7:  The other day I finished watching something. I don't even remember what it

852
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,720
Speaker 7:  wasn't miss Marvel, but I finished watching something on Disney plus. And

853
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,160
Speaker 7:  it was like, do you wanna watch captain Marvel? And I was like, you haven't

854
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,040
Speaker 7:  seen it in event. Exactly.

855
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:56,720
Speaker 6:  Play.

856
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,480
Speaker 7:  Wow. Let's go. And like,

857
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,000
Speaker 6:  And then every once in a while they'll just throw in, be like, remember all

858
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,680
Speaker 6:  those animated movies we made 40 years ago that you left. Like you wanna

859
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,920
Speaker 6:  watch it? You wanna watch that? And I'm like, yeah,

860
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,000
Speaker 7:  I do. Yeah. And whereas Netflix, I'm like you finish watching stranger things.

861
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,040
Speaker 7:  Do you wanna watch anything remotely related to that? And I'm like, sure.

862
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,280
Speaker 7:  And they're like, okay, instead we're gonna show you another like cake wars

863
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:18,280
Speaker 7:  episode. Yes. I'm like, no, that's, you've misunderstood. You've

864
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,960
Speaker 7:  missed something here. And Disney's like, I don't know. They've they've got

865
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,640
Speaker 7:  a really strong app. They they've got all of the IP, which is like, is that

866
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,040
Speaker 7:  ethically morally right? Probably not. Nope. But they got it.

867
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:32,840
Speaker 7:  They got the money, they got the, the what, 50 billion

868
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,200
Speaker 7:  or whatever they made from, from theme parks this year. They're doing

869
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,840
Speaker 9:  Great. The fast pass, the lightning lane, the genie pass.

870
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,640
Speaker 9:  I'm sorry. Bringing in tons of money in the theme. Parks turns out that charging

871
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,440
Speaker 9:  people for convenience is a good business model. Yeah. And their ad supported

872
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,400
Speaker 9:  plan is launching in December.

873
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,480
Speaker 5:  So again, I was on CBC day, Bob check was being interviewed visually B. She

874
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,600
Speaker 5:  asked him, can you raise prices in theme parks? And he was like, yeah, we'll

875
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,520
Speaker 5:  see. He was basically like, here's what we do. We like, we

876
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,120
Speaker 5:  see how much the consumer can tolerate. And then like, you know, we push

877
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,120
Speaker 5:  it. I'm not, he's like, we have no plans to at this moment. But like we're

878
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,000
Speaker 5:  always looking and it's like, yeah, you're

879
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,080
Speaker 7:  Yeah. They, they figured out they can nickel and dime you and we'll all be

880
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,400
Speaker 7:  like, yeah. Okay. Yeah. I wanna do the, the guardians of the galaxy ride.

881
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,520
Speaker 5:  I disagree with you about the, the, which the $5,000. Like

882
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,000
Speaker 5:  no, that's the star wars one.

883
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,920
Speaker 7:  Oh, the big place. Yeah. And you get the, the light saver. I'm gonna buy

884
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,040
Speaker 7:  one very excited. Two

885
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,600
Speaker 5:  MacBook. That's how you measure these experiences. Do I want two MacBook

886
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,320
Speaker 5:  or do I want to go to a spaceship,

887
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,200
Speaker 7:  Mad books

888
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,200
Speaker 6:  Then Richard would have four laptops.

889
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,560
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna, I it's true. I think they have the best app. Right? They've built

890
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,360
Speaker 5:  on bam tech. They have the best stack all the way along. Hulu is now it's

891
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,480
Speaker 5:  theirs. They're programming it with more compelling stuff. I'm just pushing

892
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,840
Speaker 5:  back. I think Disney is so big and they're so addicted to their franchises

893
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:53,600
Speaker 5:  that they are, they're losing sight of like making good stuff.

894
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,400
Speaker 6:  I would, oh, star wars is dying for that exact like star wars is, is

895
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:00,960
Speaker 5:  Just like milking that thing. And then I think they're milking the MCU in

896
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,760
Speaker 5:  like a, but

897
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,800
Speaker 7:  They're doing good stuff on Hulu. Like Hulu is where they still actually

898
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,640
Speaker 7:  have people who know TV programming it. So that's why you got the,

899
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,440
Speaker 7:  the bear. That's why you're getting, what is it? Little fires. The, the

900
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,080
Speaker 7:  little fires everywhere. Yeah. Little fires everywhere. Like you're getting

901
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,560
Speaker 7:  really good stuff on Hulu. I watch it. I think probably

902
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,440
Speaker 7:  it an HBO max are my two most watched services. And it's because

903
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,560
Speaker 7:  it's got stuff like FX where they've done really, really good programming

904
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,160
Speaker 7:  and they're putting it almost exclusively oftentimes on Hulu. And it's just

905
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
Speaker 7:  like super watchable. Yeah.

906
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,160
Speaker 5:  I'm sure like to Rich's point, like you're an investor, this is great. It's

907
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,840
Speaker 5:  all just money in Disney from a Disney, like brand perspective. Hulu app.

908
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:43,280
Speaker 5:  Not as good as even the HBO max app in some ways.

909
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,920
Speaker 5:  Right. It's like a very confusing situation.

910
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,520
Speaker 7:  Remember their linear TV built in part of the Hulu app. Yeah. Yeah. In how

911
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,480
Speaker 7:  they, they decided that they didn't wanna do a menu. Like everybody else

912
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,360
Speaker 7:  does where it looks like cable, TV. And instead they were like, no, we're

913
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,040
Speaker 7:  gonna like decide what you should watch on, on live TV. And you're like,

914
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,640
Speaker 7:  no, that's

915
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,920
Speaker 5:  No, they all do this. This is like cat for product designers. So like we're

916
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,040
Speaker 5:  doing a live TV app and they're like let's reimagine, but

917
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,360
Speaker 7:  They got yelled at so much that Hulu was like, sorry, we're we're working

918
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,400
Speaker 7:  on it. We're gonna do a really good,

919
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:14,040
Speaker 5:  No, this is the hill. They all want to climb. Like, can you, this is Steve

920
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:17,960
Speaker 5:  jobs, just gaslighting this entire industry, by saying on his

921
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:21,600
Speaker 5:  methed, he cracked the user experience for TV without any further

922
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,560
Speaker 5:  explanation. And now everyone thinks they have to crack the user experience

923
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,240
Speaker 5:  for TV. And the entire consumer base is like, we just want a grid.

924
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,560
Speaker 6:  It's the spreadsheet. We

925
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:31,680
Speaker 5:  Give us spreadsheet, spreadsheet and TV shows.

926
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:34,880
Speaker 7:  What if he cracked it by just being like, I changed the font.

927
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's what he meant. He like made it look nicer. Have you heard of

928
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,240
Speaker 5:  retina screens add more pixels? Yeah. I just, I think the danger

929
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,040
Speaker 5:  for Disney is a real stick right now. Cuz the catalog.

930
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,720
Speaker 5:  But if the show is a movies are bad over time.

931
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,800
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Run into the same problem. I

932
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,600
Speaker 7:  Mean, yeah, but they have so much, I don't think people think

933
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,160
Speaker 5:  Blue shows as Disney shows. That's what I meant by the brand thing.

934
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,920
Speaker 7:  Totally and Disney, at least in America

935
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:04,880
Speaker 7:  wants you to keep that separation. Right? Like they very much said, we're

936
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,360
Speaker 7:  not gonna put Deadpool. We're not gonna put all this like racist stuff on

937
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,480
Speaker 7:  Disney. Plus we're gonna keep that for Hulu. Cuz that's for adults and

938
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,960
Speaker 7:  Disney plus is like general, Sunday night,

939
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:19,680
Speaker 7:  magic kingdom, whatever that, that thing we all had to watch on channel eight.

940
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:23,760
Speaker 7:  Sorry, none of you're from Texas. Remember Sunday nights, there

941
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,640
Speaker 7:  was always like the Disney hour of content. Come on. Y'all are

942
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,400
Speaker 7:  old. You know this, there was like a, nothing. There was always like special.

943
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:31,760
Speaker 7:  I was

944
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,720
Speaker 5:  Watching that whole prime time.

945
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,840
Speaker 7:  There you go. But, but like they, they they're that's

946
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,400
Speaker 7:  Disney plus is their family friendly stuff and they

947
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:46,600
Speaker 7:  know as well as we all do, the little kids have trash taste for the most

948
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,120
Speaker 7:  part. So like they can pump that stuff out for a while. I think they are

949
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,680
Speaker 7:  gonna see diminishing returns. I think they are already like poisoning

950
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:57,960
Speaker 7:  their own franchises over and over again because they're not, they're thinking

951
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,960
Speaker 7:  about the money and not about the quality of the content, but

952
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:05,120
Speaker 7:  everybody else is also kind of thinking the same thing. That's true. Like

953
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,040
Speaker 7:  I buy that. Yeah. Warner brothers last week was even like, yeah, we, we don't

954
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,000
Speaker 7:  care about the money. Like we want the money. We're gonna put out stuff.

955
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,760
Speaker 7:  That'll make the money.

956
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:17,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We'll see. I okay. Let's do the good 90 sale. Yeah. So we think

957
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,200
Speaker 5:  HBO X after, after we complimented HBO X. Yeah.

958
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:21,840
Speaker 5:  It is like

959
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:22,480
Speaker 7:  It's 90.

960
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:27,000
Speaker 5:  Well it's not yet. Yeah. It's like a preemptive 90 on the tech side.

961
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:27,840
Speaker 7:  It's a 60.

962
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,640
Speaker 5:  So it's like, okay. Yeah. It's halfway between 45 and 90. Yeah.

963
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,400
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It seems right.

964
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,960
Speaker 5:  Oh that's so depressing. Yeah.

965
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:34,720
Speaker 7:  It's a bummer.

966
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:38,800
Speaker 6:  It's not HBO. Max's fault. Yeah. It's just, it's it's being,

967
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:40,960
Speaker 6:  this is happening to HBO. Max's

968
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,600
Speaker 5:  This is why merger should be legal. Yeah. Disney plus

969
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:48,600
Speaker 5:  is zero. Yeah. By the way, the go 90 scale of gym streaming services,

970
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:51,800
Speaker 5:  zero is alive 90 instead. Yeah.

971
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,120
Speaker 7:  Hulu. I don't know Hulu's higher because I think at some point like

972
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,280
Speaker 7:  Hulu doesn't exist in a lot of other markets. Right. It is pretty much an

973
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,760
Speaker 7:  American market thing. Other markets, everything just is on Disney plus

974
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,440
Speaker 7:  and in the United States they're like, no, no, we must keep these two things

975
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,000
Speaker 7:  separate, but I could definitely see them at some point. Be like, nah, smush

976
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:11,480
Speaker 7:  'em together.

977
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I, well Hulu has like a long history of people trying to kill Hulu.

978
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:15,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like at any

979
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,880
Speaker 7:  Moment it's immortal at the

980
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,400
Speaker 5:  Time. It might be the last streaming service

981
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,280
Speaker 7:  To go because it was one of

982
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,840
Speaker 5:  The first. Right. Because it's unkillable. It is like so many people have

983
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,760
Speaker 5:  tried to kill Hulu.

984
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,120
Speaker 7:  Yes.

985
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,240
Speaker 5:  I know. Like at any moment, some Disney executive gets a promotion and they're

986
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,040
Speaker 5:  like, finally

987
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,160
Speaker 7:  Disney tried to kill. Hu. They're like, we're gonna buy you and destroy you.

988
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,800
Speaker 7:  I guess we're gonna use you because otherwise everybody's gonna pirate our

989
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,080
Speaker 7:  stuff.

990
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,200
Speaker 6:  And then somebody at Hulu is just like we've signed deals to have next day

991
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,760
Speaker 6:  shows until 20, 68. Like what are you gonna do about it

992
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,400
Speaker 5:  All. So, so Richard, you're making a call that who is like a permanent zero

993
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:49,120
Speaker 5:  unkillable.

994
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,200
Speaker 9:  Can it, it can, it can never die.

995
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,920
Speaker 6:  Wow. Who is not even

996
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:53,440
Speaker 5:  It's

997
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,040
Speaker 9:  It's what the drown house. What, what does not live? Can, can never die.

998
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,080
Speaker 9:  There you go. That's who,

999
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,000
Speaker 7:  Okay. Alright.

1000
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:00,640
Speaker 5:  Netflix

1001
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:01,440
Speaker 7:  15.

1002
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,360
Speaker 9:  They still have 220 million subscribers.

1003
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:04,880
Speaker 7:  Yeah. There's still huge. I

1004
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,160
Speaker 6:  Think we, the last time we did this, I think we landed like high single digits,

1005
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,960
Speaker 6:  which feels about right.

1006
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,400
Speaker 5:  Yeah. All right. Any other streaming services on the scale this week?

1007
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,480
Speaker 7:  Parallel plus. Oh zero. You knew I was gonna say it. Wow.

1008
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,240
Speaker 6:  Greatest

1009
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,880
Speaker 5:  Look parallel. Plus is a zero all the way through the

1010
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,760
Speaker 5:  release of top gun Maverick. Yeah. Right? Like, and then it will be the

1011
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,600
Speaker 5:  most popular streaming service for a couple of weeks. Yes. And then we'll

1012
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,360
Speaker 5:  be like 90,

1013
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,280
Speaker 7:  I think as long as star Trek exists, par like, or as long

1014
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,040
Speaker 7:  as people who watch star Trek exist, we're we're dying out. Apparently

1015
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,720
Speaker 7:  a friend of mine, she, she teaches college and she's like, alright, who watches?

1016
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,840
Speaker 7:  Star track? And it used to be all the hands would raise. And she teaches

1017
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,320
Speaker 7:  like video game history. So I was like, these are nerds. Right? And she's

1018
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,400
Speaker 7:  like, okay, everybody raise your hand. If you watch star Trek, all the hands

1019
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,480
Speaker 7:  raise nowadays. She's like, raise it. And it's like one person in the back

1020
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,320
Speaker 7:  of the room who's wearing like a star Trek shirt.

1021
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,840
Speaker 6:  She's like, you get an instant, a plus

1022
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,240
Speaker 7:  You pass, everybody else fails. So like it it's slowly dying, but like

1023
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,640
Speaker 7:  as long as they're all those fans and it's like kind, it's not as big as

1024
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,520
Speaker 7:  star wars, but it's got very active community. It's, it's

1025
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:09,640
Speaker 7:  a

1026
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,560
Speaker 6:  Zero. It's gonna be interesting to watch paramount plus bleed that to

1027
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,360
Speaker 6:  death because in the same way that Disney plus bought star wars and was like,

1028
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,040
Speaker 6:  we're gonna make eight star wars things a year until all of you were

1029
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,920
Speaker 7:  Said, I'm gonna let them do it somewhere

1030
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:25,880
Speaker 5:  At the paramount plus office. There's an account with a spreadsheet and

1031
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,800
Speaker 5:  they're looking at it right now. She's freaking out. Cuz the spreadsheet

1032
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:33,280
Speaker 5:  has like a, a row in it labeled data center costs.

1033
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,840
Speaker 5:  And there's another column labeled churn

1034
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,080
Speaker 5:  and they're modeling out how many people are gonna sign up for a seven day

1035
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,280
Speaker 5:  free trial to stream top gun Maverick and then leave

1036
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:49,800
Speaker 5:  and spike the data center costs and never paid them a dollar. And they're

1037
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,880
Speaker 5:  just hoping they can, enough of those people forget to cancel.

1038
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,840
Speaker 5:  And I'm telling you, she's like freaking out. Like she's like someone needs

1039
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,760
Speaker 5:  to look at my screen right

1040
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,040
Speaker 6:  Now. She's like our payment processing systems are gonna

1041
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:03,280
Speaker 5:  Down. She just zoom in random people being like, can I share my screen? I

1042
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,680
Speaker 5:  need to share the screen with

1043
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,280
Speaker 7:  You. Are they doing, how is, is it gonna be 4k? Is it gonna be, do

1044
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:08,720
Speaker 7:  vision?

1045
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,880
Speaker 5:  If they do not stream top gun

1046
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,000
Speaker 7:  Maverick 7 23

1047
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,120
Speaker 5:  4k HTR, Amos. Like I will drive over there and be like, I'm taking

1048
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:20,040
Speaker 5:  the tapes. I'm starting my own streaming service. It's a 90 all the

1049
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,040
Speaker 5:  way, but it's gonna be glorious for a day.

1050
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,000
Speaker 7:  Top gun.

1051
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,120
Speaker 5:  There's no way. This

1052
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,760
Speaker 6:  Is called Tom cruise. The streaming surface.

1053
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Tom cruise is all about Mo like he wants you to talk.

1054
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,680
Speaker 6:  Tom would never let this happen.

1055
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:34,680
Speaker 7:  He's probably it's like in his contract, if you stream it, it can only be

1056
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:38,320
Speaker 7:  streamed at 4k with Doby Atmos. And if you detect somebody has,

1057
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:42,160
Speaker 7:  is using headphones or watching on a mobile device, their device will

1058
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:42,560
Speaker 7:  explode

1059
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:43,880
Speaker 5:  And he's

1060
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,320
Speaker 6:  Figured out how to automatically change your TV to turn off motion smoothing.

1061
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,280
Speaker 6:  He's like Tom gets it.

1062
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,840
Speaker 5:  There's gonna be a long prelude before top gun Maverick runs on the stream.

1063
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,480
Speaker 5:  Oh, there probably is. He's like, I'm moving my hand right now. Does it look

1064
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,120
Speaker 5:  too smooth? I'm gonna keep doing this for one hour. I'm

1065
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,880
Speaker 6:  Gonna read you the manual of every TV that

1066
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,480
Speaker 5:  Exists. He's like skip to five minutes for Samsung. Seven minutes for

1067
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,680
Speaker 5:  LG. I'm here

1068
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,560
Speaker 9:  With you. There will be a series of blinks in this video will adjust your

1069
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,320
Speaker 9:  TV. Just sit back and let it happen.

1070
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah. He's very serious with this in the depths of the pandemic. By the way

1071
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,840
Speaker 5:  I looked, I looked at how much it would cost to buy one of those. Like only

1072
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,280
Speaker 5:  in Hollywood dedicated high end streaming boxes. Yeah.

1073
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,840
Speaker 5:  Cause I was like, whatever, I'm never leaving this house again. It was like

1074
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,840
Speaker 5:  $15,000. And I was like, whoa, I don't, I care a lot.

1075
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,840
Speaker 5:  I don't care this much.

1076
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,360
Speaker 7:  You could get such a nice like projector for that.

1077
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:40,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Wait, you need content.

1078
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,240
Speaker 7:  Just plug that, that Roku

1079
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,440
Speaker 5:  In. And then I almost fell down. The Chris wel troll of being like, I'm gonna

1080
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,440
Speaker 5:  start buying Blueray

1081
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,360
Speaker 7:  I do that. I do that.

1082
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,840
Speaker 5:  Oh my God. You like your PL box in your Blueray.

1083
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:56,320
Speaker 7:  I I get the Blueray. I rip them. Wow. Because that's that's

1084
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,560
Speaker 7:  legal, right? Like I'm using it for my personal use.

1085
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,680
Speaker 5:  Only me. I quit being a lawyer. Ain't you lawyer quick quick. No, no, no,

1086
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:01,960
Speaker 5:  no.

1087
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,480
Speaker 7:  That's probably someone I know provides me with

1088
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,440
Speaker 7:  copies and I put 'em on my

1089
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:09,920
Speaker 5:  That's me more illegal.

1090
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,200
Speaker 6:  I meet a guy in an alley.

1091
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:16,160
Speaker 5:  That's like, here's what I do. I buy pirated movies.

1092
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,960
Speaker 5:  Now you wanna stick with, I buy the media. I own the movies and I

1093
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:25,440
Speaker 5:  rip it. There we go. Which for, for, for archival

1094
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,760
Speaker 5:  purposes, because

1095
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,320
Speaker 9:  PC as

1096
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,920
Speaker 6:  Everyone does. Yeah. As one does. Yeah.

1097
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think if you

1098
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,720
Speaker 6:  Were like, David, can you rip this DVD?

1099
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:35,760
Speaker 5:  I have

1100
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,920
Speaker 6:  Literally no idea what I would do.

1101
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah. What's your process for ripping a blue, red,

1102
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,720
Speaker 7:  You know, you, you stick it in and to what

1103
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,760
Speaker 9:  Microsoft is bringing CD ripping back to windows

1104
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,240
Speaker 9:  11. Wait, this ripping is coming back. Yeah. They're testing it in the betas.

1105
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,560
Speaker 9:  Now it's a whole thing. Wait, it wasn't in windows media player, but they

1106
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,680
Speaker 9:  are beta testing it again in the, in the beta versions in windows 11

1107
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,440
Speaker 9:  CD ripping. Are you

1108
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,520
Speaker 6:  Supposed to just like wave the CD over your

1109
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:02,840
Speaker 5:  Computer?

1110
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,120
Speaker 9:  I don't know where you put the disc, but if you have somewhere to put it,

1111
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:06,480
Speaker 9:  just

1112
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,440
Speaker 6:  Slap it on your

1113
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,520
Speaker 9:  Keyboard and again, like

1114
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,400
Speaker 5:  Automatically in the future.

1115
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:13,640
Speaker 9:  Sure. Oh my God. But if the, the, I don't think the feature is in the

1116
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,840
Speaker 9:  media player that exists in windows 11. Like the retail version right now.

1117
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,240
Speaker 9:  Right. But in the beta, but in the beta version, if you have it installed,

1118
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,880
Speaker 9:  you have a version that will rip a CD for you. I just don't know where you're

1119
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,520
Speaker 9:  going to get a CD drive, sick

1120
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,640
Speaker 5:  Or a CD. Do you think this is like Nadella himself is like, I have a

1121
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,440
Speaker 5:  number of CDs.

1122
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,560
Speaker 6:  My blue recollection

1123
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:34,320
Speaker 5:  Is there's a back for me. Okay. First of all, that's

1124
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:38,200
Speaker 5:  incredible. Love that the Plex community freaking out, walk me

1125
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,320
Speaker 5:  through your Blueray riffing process.

1126
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:45,720
Speaker 7:  You can buy, buy for like $50. Now it's so cheap. You can just

1127
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,680
Speaker 7:  get a little player. Okay. And yet you plug

1128
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,720
Speaker 5:  It in a USBC Blueray player. Yeah,

1129
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:49,880
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

1130
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. Is it USBC?

1131
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:54,920
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. Well, no mine's USB mine's USB, but they got USBC

1132
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,400
Speaker 7:  ones now too, because I had to walk my sister through buying

1133
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,600
Speaker 5:  One. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Because

1134
00:56:58,970 --> 00:56:59,320
Speaker 7:  She's

1135
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,640
Speaker 5:  Still because she's also a buyer

1136
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:04,880
Speaker 7:  She's still listens to CDs. Okay. And I was like,

1137
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,800
Speaker 7:  I was like, you don't need a disc player. Like she held onto her iBook for

1138
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:11,280
Speaker 7:  years cuz she was like, I need a CD player. That's great. And I was like,

1139
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:11,480
Speaker 7:  your

1140
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,400
Speaker 5:  Sister's my favorite person.

1141
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,880
Speaker 7:  No, she's the worst. But, but no. So

1142
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,840
Speaker 7:  you, you plug in your little cheap Blueray player. Sure. You put the disc

1143
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,480
Speaker 7:  in. You have to have, I can't remember the name of the app, but you have

1144
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,760
Speaker 7:  to have this one cuz it's been like at least a year since I did this, you

1145
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,280
Speaker 7:  have this one app that like removes Anem

1146
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:30,320
Speaker 5:  DRM.

1147
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:32,280
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Any barriers

1148
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,960
Speaker 6:  Year, would you say this app was

1149
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,040
Speaker 5:  Most recent legal barriers

1150
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,520
Speaker 5:  that I put there to keep you from

1151
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,360
Speaker 9:  It? It enables media freedom.

1152
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:44,520
Speaker 7:  Yeah, exactly. And then you just use hand break, like, like

1153
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,480
Speaker 7:  you rip it and you put it into

1154
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,120
Speaker 5:  Hand break compress it. So you're further compressing it with hand break.

1155
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:49,600
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1156
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,280
Speaker 5:  So you're accomplishing very little for all the stuff.

1157
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:56,240
Speaker 7:  Because when I did uncompressed, it was great. And then I put it on my

1158
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,680
Speaker 7:  Plex server and my Plex server was like, what are you doing?

1159
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,480
Speaker 5:  Shield started smoking. It's

1160
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,360
Speaker 7:  Like on fire. It was like, I'm coming to you kill you right now.

1161
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:04,720
Speaker 7:  But

1162
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,400
Speaker 5:  Like, why not just play the Blueray

1163
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,280
Speaker 7:  Cause I have to like stand up

1164
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,880
Speaker 9:  This. This is why I have, this is why we have streaming dozens of blueberry

1165
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,640
Speaker 9:  discs that I have never watched. Okay. And I only see them when I move and

1166
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,960
Speaker 9:  I have to pick them up and carry them. And I'm like, why do I have these?

1167
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:18,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But you keep buying them.

1168
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,600
Speaker 9:  I need the best

1169
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,600
Speaker 5:  Quality for media freedom

1170
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,160
Speaker 9:  For archival reasons. Yeah.

1171
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:25,080
Speaker 7:  What happens if you, you lose internet,

1172
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,140
Speaker 7:  you go somewhere without

1173
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,980
Speaker 5:  Internet. I try point out that you described your process for this and you

1174
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,700
Speaker 5:  are recompress the Blueray

1175
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:38,940
Speaker 7:  It's not as good, but it's still better than if I watched it on

1176
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,140
Speaker 7:  Netflix or any of the other places.

1177
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:40,540
Speaker 5:  If you've

1178
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,460
Speaker 9:  Ever tried to watch, justify it on Amazon prime you, then you know why you

1179
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:46,260
Speaker 9:  would do this. The video quality on the stream is just terrible. I

1180
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,700
Speaker 6:  Feel like you're doing a lot of work that you could just buy it like on

1181
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,220
Speaker 6:  iTunes and download it to your computer. And you've, you've done the same

1182
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,460
Speaker 7:  Thing. It's it's not quite as good a lot of times.

1183
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,820
Speaker 5:  All right. Well

1184
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:57,900
Speaker 7:  Change to

1185
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,620
Speaker 5:  Cruise. If you're listening and you wanna come on the show, unless you're

1186
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,860
Speaker 5:  Alex about fire C and why that's hurting Hollywood doors open. She

1187
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:07,820
Speaker 7:  Would be on my side because I'm still getting the Blueray. Sometimes I

1188
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,020
Speaker 7:  watch

1189
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:11,420
Speaker 5:  Them. You think Tom cruise would be on the side of you should buy

1190
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,500
Speaker 5:  $50. USBC Blueray drive.

1191
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:14,260
Speaker 7:  Yes.

1192
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,660
Speaker 5:  Remove the Dr.

1193
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:16,980
Speaker 7:  I can. I can. And

1194
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,780
Speaker 5:  Then recompress top gun Maverick.

1195
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:22,560
Speaker 7:  I, I got this. Like if anyone knows Tom and I would vibe, it'd be

1196
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,520
Speaker 5:  Fine. I'm excited for Tom to be on the show. If anyone out there knows Tom,

1197
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,920
Speaker 5:  I'm sure he is listening. If anyone out there knows Tom, tell us what

1198
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,240
Speaker 5:  DRM removal tool you use and then we'll let you come on podcast.

1199
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:33,240
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1200
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:37,040
Speaker 6:  And if you'd like to come do a 30 minute PSA about how to turn off motion,

1201
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,800
Speaker 6:  smoothing on your TV ahead of watching top gun Maverick. We're

1202
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,280
Speaker 5:  Here for that. One of my favorite parts just about like modern life at this

1203
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,920
Speaker 5:  moment is like, everyone is constantly using computers and every now and

1204
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,840
Speaker 5:  again, I like to imagine Tom cruise, like confronting stage manager on

1205
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,280
Speaker 5:  his iPad.

1206
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:56,240
Speaker 5:  Like, it's just like you can't none of that works together. You know?

1207
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:00,520
Speaker 5:  Like he's like, oh you gotta send an email and like, oh, he's looking

1208
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,680
Speaker 5:  at the same weird Gmail interface as

1209
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:06,000
Speaker 7:  The rest of us. You think Tom cruise sends emails.

1210
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:10,400
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. No unhinged all caps. Oh absolutely. Sentence.

1211
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:10,640
Speaker 5:  Email.

1212
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,160
Speaker 7:  Absolutely enormous. He has somebody he tells

1213
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,280
Speaker 7:  no like, no he shouts at someone.

1214
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,560
Speaker 6:  No I'm with he shouts at Siri is what he does. Tom cruise is a

1215
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,320
Speaker 5:  Monster. So he use his mail app. Just play this game.

1216
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:27,920
Speaker 5:  It's incredibly fun. Imagine any Hollywood celebrity you can think of? Yeah.

1217
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:32,000
Speaker 5:  And be like Kim Kardashian sometimes is like these

1218
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,880
Speaker 5:  Google search results are full of ads because everyone is having the

1219
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,560
Speaker 5:  same experiences all the time. Like it's all the same.

1220
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,680
Speaker 5:  I, Kanye west is like, hi, I gotta get on Instagram. It's all

1221
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,440
Speaker 5:  videos. Now

1222
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:48,920
Speaker 7:  They have assistants who do that. They have a Google assistant.

1223
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:52,880
Speaker 5:  No, Kanye's like out there being like, I don't have only pants. I have read

1224
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,840
Speaker 5:  it. Like I've heard him say those words and it's all the same.

1225
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,920
Speaker 5:  I it's the best. We should just do an entire episode of our chest where imagine

1226
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,560
Speaker 5:  celebrities using all right, Liam wants me to wrap this up. Cause I said

1231
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,080

1235
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,640

1236
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,720
Speaker 16:  what was it like telling Lauren?

1237
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,240
Speaker 17:  Oh man

1238
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:52,440
Speaker 17:  telling Lauren was really hard. He knew it was

1239
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,320
Speaker 17:  coming. He was very sweet, but he is, has

1240
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:56,560
Speaker 17:  been

1241
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,200
Speaker 17:  a father figure to me and so much more and

1242
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,920
Speaker 17:  was just really hard. Yeah. Simple human emotions.

1243
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:10,640
Speaker 17:  Not wanting to say goodbye to something you love

1244
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,240
Speaker 16:  To listen to the full interview search for a good one. Wherever you get

1245
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:14,600
Speaker 16:  your podcast.

1246
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:20,000
Speaker 5:  Hi, I'm Eli Patel. I'm the editor in chief of the verge. And I'm also the

1247
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,600
Speaker 5:  host of decoder. It's a business and technology podcast where I interview

1248
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,160
Speaker 5:  a diverse cast of C-suite executives, creators and policy makers.

1249
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,840
Speaker 5:  I ask him how they make decisions, what their org charts look like, what

1250
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,360
Speaker 5:  keeps him up at night and what the future for their industries hold. We just

1251
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:37,320
Speaker 5:  had Hank green on the show. He's one of the biggest YouTubers around. Here's

1252
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,520
Speaker 5:  what he said. When I asked him if he could quit YouTube.

1253
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:44,240
Speaker 19:  No, both culturally and economically. I could not walk away from YouTube,

1254
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:48,160
Speaker 19:  but I it's. It's a little bit like saying, would you walk away from America

1255
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,680
Speaker 19:  for me? You know, it's like, there's, there's things I very much don't like

1256
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,600
Speaker 19:  about it, but I, you know, I feel a little like a citizen and

1257
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:59,680
Speaker 19:  that would be such a big decision to make for me culturally. But in terms

1258
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,640
Speaker 19:  of money, no, also no monetization, like just a sense is really

1259
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,640
Speaker 19:  quite powerful.

1260
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:10,960
Speaker 5:  This conversation with Hank green was endlessly fascinating. He has so many

1261
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:14,960
Speaker 5:  ideas on how creators can and should make money. So if you like that clip

1264
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:29,480
Speaker 5:  All right. We're back lightning round. A lot of little news this week.

1265
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:33,640
Speaker 5:  I just mentioned email. So I gotta mention this one. So politicians wanna

1266
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:36,600
Speaker 5:  send you emails. You may have gotten these emails. You might have thought

1267
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,160
Speaker 5:  to yourself, wow. These emails are all written like scams. Yeah. Turns out

1268
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:44,320
Speaker 5:  Google's filters have agreed with you for many years. And

1269
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,120
Speaker 5:  politicians emails have been filtered into your spam.

1270
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,440
Speaker 6:  And some politicians think Google is, is perpetrating a

1271
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,160
Speaker 6:  giant scheme to send some people to your inbox and some email and some to

1272
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:55,360
Speaker 6:  spam

1273
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,600
Speaker 7:  Shadow ban. Exactly.

1274
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. This is like a real thing that happens. So they yelled at Google enough.

1275
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:04,240
Speaker 5:  And so Google concocted a plan by which politicians could

1276
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,000
Speaker 5:  request to be exempted from Google's spam

1277
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:11,840
Speaker 5:  filters. And today the federal election commission said, yep, that's fine.

1278
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:15,120
Speaker 5:  You can do your plan. This is like one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.

1279
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:19,000
Speaker 5:  Like what emails do I want the least any politician

1280
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,840
Speaker 5:  asking me for money?

1281
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:23,920
Speaker 7:  I still get asked by Wendy Davis for money and to vote in Texas

1282
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:29,360
Speaker 7:  still. I don't want those emails. Yeah. I marked them as spam on purpose.

1283
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:33,040
Speaker 5:  Now they're gonna get through and it's like the worst political pressure

1284
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:33,680
Speaker 5:  campaign you can pick.

1285
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,600
Speaker 6:  I think if politicians should be able to request not to be spam, we as

1286
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:41,560
Speaker 6:  users should be able to request not to be emailed by them. Like if, if, if

1287
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:45,400
Speaker 6:  Gmail can control this, that cleanly on one side, it should be able to give

1288
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:49,320
Speaker 6:  us a toggle that says, no, thank you, politicians goodbye. And

1289
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,640
Speaker 6:  just for my email,

1290
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,200
Speaker 7:  All politicians

1291
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,320
Speaker 5:  Push that button in a heartbeat. Yeah.

1292
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,920
Speaker 7:  A hundred percent. The texts, like if I could do that on my phone, like,

1293
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,400
Speaker 7:  oh, we know that this is somebody texting you to donate money

1294
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:02,560
Speaker 7:  to your local.

1295
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:06,880
Speaker 6:  Somehow I got on Nancy Pelosi's list as a person named Freddy, I get a

1296
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,520
Speaker 6:  text message. Probably five times a week being like Freddy, this is urgent.

1297
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:11,320
Speaker 5:  Oh,

1298
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:12,280
Speaker 6:  It gives me $6.

1299
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,320
Speaker 5:  A real clever online harassment. Gamut is people try to sign me up for like

1300
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:21,360
Speaker 5:  all the things. And now they're all filtered. And so they still

1301
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,280
Speaker 5:  try to do it. I'm like, no, no, you don't understand. This was five years

1302
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:23,560
Speaker 5:  ago.

1303
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:28,600
Speaker 5:  No, you don't understand. I was already signed up as Freddy for Nancy Pelosi.

1304
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:30,600
Speaker 5:  This like you can't hurt me anymore.

1305
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:35,680
Speaker 5:  Alright, Richard, are you at proof of stake this week? This is like a true

1306
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,600
Speaker 5:  light. We're just bouncing around Ethereum for years has promised

1307
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,480
Speaker 5:  a switch from proof of work, which is a lot of energy to proof of sake, which

1308
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,000
Speaker 5:  different method of mining and validating transaction that I work supposed

1309
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,760
Speaker 5:  to be more energy efficient. I forced Richard to listen to a

1310
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,680
Speaker 5:  hardcore theory of engineering conference call today. What did you

1311
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,320
Speaker 9:  Learn? I listened to an hour and a half of people talking about the blockchain

1312
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:00,560
Speaker 9:  and blocks and every everything they, I don't even

1313
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,440
Speaker 9:  know what words they were using. None of them were in the Bible.

1314
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:03,640
Speaker 5:  But

1315
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,760
Speaker 9:  I think the, I think what they ended up saying was that they they've completed

1316
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,680
Speaker 9:  their last test merge of a network. And it mostly worked. There were,

1317
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,960
Speaker 9:  there were a few glitches that they're still working out, but they think

1318
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,680
Speaker 9:  they're ready to do it for real to move the full network over to this proof

1319
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:22,040
Speaker 9:  of stake system, that's going to use so much less energy and they have basically

1320
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,440
Speaker 9:  a date. Haven't they

1321
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,880
Speaker 6:  Been saying almost exactly that for like three

1322
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,080
Speaker 5:  Years,

1323
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:27,440
Speaker 6:  Five, five years. Okay.

1324
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:28,040
Speaker 5:  For

1325
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:32,040
Speaker 9:  Years and years and years, but now they have a date for the, the final, final,

1326
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:34,760
Speaker 9:  final, final, final merge.

1327
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:36,160
Speaker 7:  Okay. When is it

1328
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:39,560
Speaker 9:  The terminal date? The, the TTD is

1329
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,200
Speaker 9:  September 15 or 16, depending on when the block get mine.

1330
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:44,120
Speaker 6:  Perfect.

1331
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:49,160
Speaker 5:  So maybe it'll happen. Maybe won't I think everyone knows I'm on record saying

1332
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,160
Speaker 5:  this will never happen too complicated. Never gonna do it. If it does happen.

1333
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:56,120
Speaker 5:  Here's the wild part. That is horrible news for AMD

1334
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,960
Speaker 5:  and Nvidia. Yes. Because the requirements for mining validating

1335
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:03,520
Speaker 5:  will go down. A bunch of Ethereum. Mins will flood the market with used

1336
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:07,720
Speaker 5:  GPUs. The demand for GPUs will go down. But then that's also like when

1337
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,520
Speaker 5:  ay and a video will have their new GPS coming out and everyone often big,

1338
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,160
Speaker 5:  big decision about whether you wanna use, I mean, this a GP that's been used

1339
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,080
Speaker 5:  for mining for years, which maybe you don't cause things been rut and red

1340
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,040
Speaker 5:  hot for so long, but like already like the analysts

1341
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,960
Speaker 5:  like Morgan Stanley is like bad news coming for GPU vendors for

1342
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,520
Speaker 5:  chip makers because Ethereum is going to proof of stick

1343
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,440
Speaker 7:  Didn't like invi

1344
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:29,240
Speaker 5:  Ever do

1345
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:33,240
Speaker 7:  Didn't Invidia go out of its way to be like stop using us. Did I make that

1346
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:33,320
Speaker 7:  up?

1347
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,000
Speaker 5:  They put in the flag, but yeah,

1348
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:35,920
Speaker 7:  But people just ignore

1349
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:36,840
Speaker 6:  That accomplished nothing.

1350
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,040
Speaker 5:  I think it accomplished nothing.

1351
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,920
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Invidia

1352
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:43,720
Speaker 9:  Sex. Yeah. I think they got around that in like a day. Yeah. Go this

1353
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:44,200
Speaker 9:  place.

1354
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,640
Speaker 5:  They tried. So we'll see if, but I would just say like that's, to me, it's,

1355
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:51,240
Speaker 5:  there's the Ethereum story, which would be cool. And then like, I'm happy

1356
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,920
Speaker 5:  if anything uses less energy, but then like the main complaints about

1357
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:56,720
Speaker 5:  NFTs of which Richard has many

1358
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:02,560
Speaker 5:  grant, the, the big one is like, this is a lot of power to use

1359
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:07,320
Speaker 5:  for Pokemon. We should cool it. And that, that thing

1360
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:08,680
Speaker 5:  goes away, which I think is

1361
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,280
Speaker 6:  Interesting. Yeah. I mean the, the switch to proof of sake is, has like everyone

1362
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,440
Speaker 6:  in the crypto community is like any problem. You have anything you, you don't

1363
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,360
Speaker 6:  like about crypto or web three proof of stake fixes it. Yeah. It's like

1364
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:23,080
Speaker 6:  it. This is like the magic bullet that will make all of this work and be

1365
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:23,280
Speaker 6:  viable.

1366
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:27,560
Speaker 9:  Well, if it weren't an environmental nightmare, the thing that would be left

1367
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:30,800
Speaker 9:  is that all of their applications are useless and do things that no one wants,

1368
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:34,160
Speaker 9:  but they would get rid of this one problem.

1369
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:34,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1370
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:38,080
Speaker 6:  That's now it's environmentally friendly to have an app that no one uses

1371
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,280
Speaker 6:  or wants. Yes. It's perfect.

1372
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:43,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Beautiful. It's we'll see. We're gonna keep tracking it. I think I'm

1373
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,280
Speaker 5:  with Richard even money and they push it another six months.

1374
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:48,520
Speaker 9:  It, it, it has always been delayed. There's no way that it doesn't get delayed.

1375
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,440
Speaker 9:  At least once we will

1376
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,640
Speaker 5:  Eat Crow, if it I'll, we'll have Richard back on and he can announce that

1377
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,080
Speaker 5:  here has switched to proof of stake. And you're, you're here with me. Look

1378
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,480
Speaker 5:  at my eyes. You have to come back on and announce it, switch

1379
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,600
Speaker 6:  To proof. We will force him to buy an NFT on air.

1380
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,600
Speaker 5:  I don't think we can do that. I think what we'll do is

1381
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:04,240
Speaker 9:  We're starting my

1382
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:09,520
Speaker 9:  I'm going to become a web three booster. Yeah. I'm going to all the conferences.

1383
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:10,680
Speaker 9:  There we go. I'm one of those guys,

1384
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:15,320
Speaker 5:  Bunch of apple stuff, rumors, rumors, rumors

1385
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:17,960
Speaker 5:  sounds like the next iPhone might be more expensive, like

1386
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,480
Speaker 7:  15%. But, but that number, the 15% is like

1387
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:25,400
Speaker 7:  all the iPhones together. So some iPhones could be way more

1388
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,560
Speaker 7:  expensive. Some could be like $5.

1389
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,560
Speaker 5:  I bet they do a super expensive iPhone pro.

1390
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:30,040
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1391
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:34,040
Speaker 5:  Like if you're looking at Samsung being like $1,800, you're like, yeah, we

1392
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,480
Speaker 5:  could, we can charge what's

1393
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,200
Speaker 7:  In an $1,800 iPhone.

1394
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,440
Speaker 5:  It's pro dude.

1395
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:42,400
Speaker 6:  It's huge. It's just nine inch screen, but they call it an iPhone.

1396
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:45,760
Speaker 7:  It's just the iPad mini with more cameras on back.

1397
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,560
Speaker 5:  No, they're, they'll do like a riff on the, a serious processor that like

1398
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,280
Speaker 5:  makes it more like an M one they're like add another camera lens. Like you

1399
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,960
Speaker 5:  can see how they could just get you to $1,800 phone.

1400
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:59,000
Speaker 7:  I just I'm upset because I always try to justify why I need a pro and I

1401
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,560
Speaker 7:  always do. And if they do that, I'll be like, I that's stupid. That's too

1402
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,920
Speaker 7:  stupid. I can't do that. Yeah. And that's a bummer for me personally, cuz

1403
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,080
Speaker 7:  I like to be like, yeah, it's my pro.

1404
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:10,200
Speaker 5:  Well, so the rumor this year, right? Is that they're gonna do a Mac size

1405
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,760
Speaker 5:  regular iPhone because everyone loves the big cheap screen. And so for the

1406
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,160
Speaker 5:  longest time you ended up buying the pro cuz you just wanted the bigger screen.

1407
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:19,280
Speaker 5:  So you gotta really scoot something over there to make it

1408
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,080
Speaker 7:  Worth it. I would buy the pro because it had the smallest screen too.

1409
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:22,960
Speaker 5:  I

1410
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,320
Speaker 7:  Just, the regular pro is always smaller than the

1411
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,360
Speaker 5:  Others. I'm just gonna put out there that revealed preferences. Say, people

1412
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,240
Speaker 5:  say shit like that all the time. Where's Allison

1413
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:31,120
Speaker 7:  Gotta

1414
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,680
Speaker 9:  Get Allison. My wife looking

1415
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:33,800
Speaker 5:  Your phone owns

1416
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,600
Speaker 9:  Specifically

1417
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,280
Speaker 7:  For Allison,

1418
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:37,720
Speaker 9:  Slightly smaller phone.

1419
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:38,960
Speaker 5:  Say that over again.

1420
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:42,240
Speaker 9:  My wife, my wife owns the iPhone pro specifically for that reason, she, she

1421
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,920
Speaker 9:  needs a phone that is slightly smaller to fit her hands and bought it.

1422
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:45,720
Speaker 7:  Thank you.

1423
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:49,080
Speaker 9:  Thank you. I was surprised, but it, it works better for her.

1424
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,880
Speaker 7:  If we're not getting Allison on the line, we can get your wife on the line

1425
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,680
Speaker 7:  to support me here.

1426
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,280
Speaker 5:  Everyone says they want a small phone. Some people buy small phones. Most

1427
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,600
Speaker 5:  people are three. They get into the store. And like what's the biggest cheapest

1428
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,760
Speaker 5:  screen you have. Liam is holding up his phone. Like

1429
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:05,840
Speaker 7:  He's small, it's a small phone. Right?

1430
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,720
Speaker 6:  He will presumably return it in two weeks.

1431
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:11,600
Speaker 5:  I'm just don't do it. Like he's doing the full John QSAC in the window right

1432
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,880
Speaker 5:  now at this phone above his head. It

1433
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,760
Speaker 7:  Was, was very romantic

1434
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:20,480
Speaker 5:  AirPods cases with USBC. Not this year, but next it sounds

1435
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:20,720
Speaker 5:  like

1436
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:22,080
Speaker 6:  Seems perfectly logical.

1437
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:25,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah. If they move the iPhone to USBC, then they have to move the AirPods.

1438
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:26,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. That seems obvious.

1439
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:30,200
Speaker 6:  Even if they don't, I mean it's like apple has rapidly moved everything else

1440
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:34,240
Speaker 6:  to USBC and there's no like giant accessories ecosystem

1441
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:38,040
Speaker 6:  for the AirPods. So that seems like a really easy switch for them to make

1442
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:40,720
Speaker 6:  like the case they're gonna make the case they've made for not searching

1443
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,160
Speaker 6:  for lightning is like we have a big ecosystem. People have chargers. People

1444
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:46,040
Speaker 6:  have stuff that they like to use. It's a total nonsense argument, but that's

1445
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,000
Speaker 6:  the argument that you cannot make that argument about AirPods. Like I have

1446
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,400
Speaker 6:  cool stuff. I plug my AirPods case into is like not a thing that people say.

1447
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:54,080
Speaker 5:  So,

1448
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:58,120
Speaker 6:  So like, I, it does seem like we are headed towards a world where the iPhone

1449
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:01,640
Speaker 6:  is also on USBC, but I don't necessarily see this as like a harbinger of

1450
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,120
Speaker 6:  that. This is just like a thing they're gonna do.

1451
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:06,640
Speaker 7:  Is this related at all to the EU saying, everybody's gotta go USBC.

1452
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:11,080
Speaker 6:  I assume so. I mean, that's like, that's gonna be part of where this

1453
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,480
Speaker 6:  all has to end up. Right? Yeah.

1454
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,400
Speaker 9:  Even if they go port less on the iPhone, which I don't think they would do,

1455
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:19,200
Speaker 9:  you would still wanna move the AirPods to USBC because you would have no

1456
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,880
Speaker 9:  reason to ship lightning cables anymore.

1457
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,520
Speaker 6:  Exactly.

1458
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:24,200
Speaker 7:  Well you would, if you kept the AirPods on it,

1459
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:28,760
Speaker 6:  No they'd rather sell you really, really expensive USBC cables.

1460
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,480
Speaker 7:  That's true. Hundred dollars.

1461
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,840
Speaker 5:  Speaking of apple, one last thing I 16 has

1462
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,360
Speaker 5:  added a battery percentage meter.

1463
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:37,520
Speaker 7:  It's go

1464
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:41,440
Speaker 5:  It's it's really weird. So you can, you can always get it. You can get it

1465
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,200
Speaker 5:  right now in control center. Yeah. But they took it away, causes the notch

1466
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:47,080
Speaker 5:  on the main screen. So now they've added back, but the thing stays full all

1467
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,360
Speaker 5:  the time. It just has a number in it.

1468
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:52,320
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So it'll say like in the, in the photo we have in our story, it

1469
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,280
Speaker 6:  says 49, but the thing is all filled up.

1470
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:58,960
Speaker 6:  It literally makes it look like you have 49 batteries.

1471
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:04,280
Speaker 5:  Something's going on with apple design right now. There's deeply unsettled,

1472
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:08,160
Speaker 5:  like hardware design on a real high note. Yes. Right? Like

1473
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,680
Speaker 5:  laptops are better than ever M one chip SIM two chips. They're like apple

1474
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,440
Speaker 5:  hardware engineering can do no wrong. And the software engineers like we're

1475
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:15,720
Speaker 5:  drunk

1476
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:17,240
Speaker 7:  Piles

1477
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:21,360
Speaker 5:  Got piles of windows. Have you ever thought about 49 batteries on your phone?

1478
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:25,080
Speaker 5:  Like I know what's going on there, but it's back, which is good.

1479
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,440
Speaker 5:  Talking about Sonos ever so slightly bad quarter for them.

1480
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:33,920
Speaker 5:  Here's the fascinating part. They delayed their next product, which Al

1481
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,560
Speaker 5:  police would be the sub mini. That kind makes sense. Yeah.

1482
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:40,480
Speaker 6:  Like which Chris Welch has been leaking relentlessly yeah. For months.

1483
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,480
Speaker 5:  But this is really interesting. So Sonos sales are all TV,

1484
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:48,840
Speaker 5:  accessory sales. Yeah. And TV sales are down, which means Sonos, soundbar

1485
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,720
Speaker 5:  sales are down. So like, there's just a lot of thinking, like maybe all the

1486
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:56,280
Speaker 5:  upgrades happened already. Like all the work from home pandemic

1487
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,920
Speaker 5:  upgrades happened and these companies are all gonna be hurting for the next

1488
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,480
Speaker 5:  couple years because there's no more upgrade cycle for any of this stuff.

1489
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:06,400
Speaker 6:  I've been thinking a lot about what Adam Messer said. I think last week

1490
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,480
Speaker 6:  that like the assumption that all these companies made during the pandemic

1491
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:13,480
Speaker 6:  was it accelerated these trends, but we're never going back to the way

1492
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,560
Speaker 6:  that we were before. And actually what might be happening is we are currently

1493
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,320
Speaker 6:  in the midst of going back to the way that we were

1494
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,640
Speaker 5:  Before, or like even farther. Yeah.

1495
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,240
Speaker 7:  A hundred percent,

1496
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,760
Speaker 6:  Which is super interesting to me. And I feel like is like, this is the kind

1497
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,600
Speaker 6:  of thing. I think we're gonna see a lot of places where it's like, people

1498
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:30,240
Speaker 6:  either bought stuff that they're not gonna upgrade for a long time. Or

1499
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:33,560
Speaker 6:  they're just gonna go back to the way that they were when they were allowed

1500
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:37,080
Speaker 6:  to go outside again. And like the amount of time we spend using these things

1501
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:40,920
Speaker 6:  is going to go down that we're not people don't use zoom as like a normal

1502
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:43,480
Speaker 6:  life behavior. Now we use zoom because we have to, and now that we don't

1503
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,480
Speaker 6:  have to, people are gonna stop.

1504
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:47,600
Speaker 7:  Yeah. We saw that with like Netflix. That was part of their earnings. Yeah.

1505
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,280
Speaker 7:  Narrative. Is that like, yeah. Everybody subscribed and now they don't

1506
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,720
Speaker 7:  subscribe because they can go outside and see people.

1507
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:57,400
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like, I think you're right. That like the Sonos thing

1508
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:01,280
Speaker 6:  is just like everybody who was gonna buy one of these just

1509
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:01,440
Speaker 6:  did.

1510
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:05,240
Speaker 9:  And now that you have one, like you don't have anywhere to put anymore. It's

1511
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,400
Speaker 9:  like the Amazon problem where you buy one thing and suddenly it shows you

1512
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,880
Speaker 9:  advertisements for only that project. Yes. Every single time you go to Amazon,

1513
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:14,720
Speaker 9:  but I bought new speakers. I bought a racing wheel. I bought a keyboard

1514
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:19,320
Speaker 9:  gaming headsets. Progressively better headphones. I have them

1515
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,120
Speaker 9:  all now. Yeah.

1516
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:20,480
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1517
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:24,520
Speaker 9:  I, for like the next four years, I don't need to purchase any other things.

1518
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:28,280
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I know you and you will, you will. Well, yeah, I've done you for a

1519
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:28,560
Speaker 5:  long time.

1520
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:31,400
Speaker 6:  Well, I have one racing wheel when you're have two risking things.

1521
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:35,080
Speaker 9:  What am I expected to carry it from upstairs to downstairs?

1522
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,000
Speaker 5:  I think that's like actually a real hard part for SES, right? Like they're

1523
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,240
Speaker 5:  in this big patent lawsuit with Google, Google just filed another version

1524
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,240
Speaker 5:  of the patent lawsuit for really dumb stuff. Yeah. For how, when you have

1525
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,160
Speaker 5:  multiple speakers in a room that you detect, which, which one's closer to

1526
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,360
Speaker 5:  you and that's when you let at voice that Googles patent, they file SOS.

1527
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:58,160
Speaker 5:  They should all just sell these lawsuits. But so Google it say Google, try

1528
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,920
Speaker 5:  to crush them. They're not in the store, all this stuff. That's like one

1529
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,880
Speaker 5:  big distraction. And on the flip side of it, you've got maybe all the

1530
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,200
Speaker 5:  TV upgrades happened. And our, the biggest part of our business is selling

1531
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,560
Speaker 5:  upgrades under TVs, which are sound bars. Yep. So now you've gotta like get

1532
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:15,280
Speaker 5:  more speakers and more rooms or figure out more service revenue on the speakers.

1533
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,160
Speaker 5:  You have Sono owners, famously persnickety about being asked for additional

1534
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,280
Speaker 5:  money. It's I think it's just a hard place

1535
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,320
Speaker 7:  Or make better stuff.

1536
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,040
Speaker 6:  I think it's not even that. I think it's, they, they need to make new stuff.

1537
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:28,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like, like Sonos thing has been to basically, they're like, we're gonna

1538
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,440
Speaker 6:  make a sound bar. And then our next product is gonna be a cheaper sound bar.

1539
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,760
Speaker 6:  And then our product, after that, that's gonna be more expensive soundbar.

1540
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:36,920
Speaker 6:  But if everybody who's gonna have a sound bar already has a sound bar. Like

1541
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:40,280
Speaker 6:  you have to go, you have to go invent a new market of things, power they're

1542
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:40,480
Speaker 6:  going to do.

1543
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:41,640
Speaker 9:  They're also in a situation

1544
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,040
Speaker 5:  Where they go,

1545
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:43,640
Speaker 7:  That's all

1546
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,160
Speaker 9:  I wanna suddenly don't wanna sell TVs anymore. They wanna make money on the

1547
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,440
Speaker 9:  services and the commissions of streaming streaming services and advertisements

1548
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:54,200
Speaker 9:  and selling TVs is suddenly not the biggest part of their business.

1549
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,960
Speaker 7:  I mean, they've been TVs have been dealing with this problem for a while.

1550
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,800
Speaker 7:  Right? Like they had this big, everybody went out and got moved to high

1551
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:04,080
Speaker 7:  Def and then nobody wanted to move to 4k because it was stupid. And so they

1552
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,080
Speaker 7:  kept being like, what are reasons to get people to move to 4k. It was HDR.

1553
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:10,640
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And then that was kind of successful, but not totally

1554
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:14,240
Speaker 7:  successful. And so they they're always, they've always been looking. They,

1555
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:18,080
Speaker 7:  we need a revenue stream besides just selling TVs because selling TVs

1556
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,280
Speaker 7:  is not enough to keep the TV lights on.

1557
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:23,760
Speaker 5:  You must still turn there, which is, they all tried to convince us for a

1558
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,320
Speaker 5:  long time that 3d TV would drive an upgrade.

1559
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:26,200
Speaker 7:  We don't talk about that time.

1560
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:28,040
Speaker 5:  Rich. And I lived through that time

1561
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:30,840
Speaker 9:  TV appreciated. It's a great way to watch NBA games

1562
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,600
Speaker 7:  That is incorrect.

1563
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:32,840
Speaker 5:  What are you talking about?

1564
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:36,240
Speaker 9:  You can see the angle, like the, the three quarter angle of the court. So

1565
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:38,800
Speaker 9:  when people pass and when people shoot, it's very difficult to

1566
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,360
Speaker 5:  See Andrew ever broadcast in 3d.

1567
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:41,360
Speaker 9:  I watched all of

1568
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,880
Speaker 6:  Them. Are you the person now at

1569
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:43,160
Speaker 5:  Six?

1570
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:44,560
Speaker 9:  It was, it

1571
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,120
Speaker 6:  Was a few. So now all these leagues who were like put on your

1572
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:51,840
Speaker 6:  Oculus quest and you can watch it, like you're on the site. It's you? You're

1573
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,880
Speaker 6:  the one watching. Yes.

1574
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:57,560
Speaker 7:  The confidence, like just the sureness of that.

1575
01:17:57,670 --> 01:18:00,760
Speaker 6:  Yeah. We'll we'll hang out a virtual Allstar game next year. It'll be great.

1576
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,200
Speaker 6:  It's gonna be sick.

1577
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:05,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I will never, this is my favorite CS story. And then we'll wrap this

1578
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,240
Speaker 5:  up, cuz we're way over. Do you remember the CS where Sony had Taylor swift

1579
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,760
Speaker 5:  perform? It was years ago. This and this was before Taylor swift was like

1580
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,440
Speaker 5:  Taylor swift. It was like, yeah, it was early on. So I go

1581
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:20,560
Speaker 5:  in Vegas in the convention center, I sit down and they're like Sony recording

1582
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,280
Speaker 5:  artists, Taylor swift. And they gave us all glasses

1583
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:28,160
Speaker 5:  and we were not meant to watch actual Taylor swift.

1584
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:31,720
Speaker 5:  We were meant to watch 3d TVs,

1585
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,120
Speaker 5:  broadcasting Taylors, who was right there. And they're like, look at this

1586
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,880
Speaker 5:  incredible demonstration of Sony's end to end 3d

1587
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,720
Speaker 5:  broadcast capabilities. And I was like, I'm gonna watch Taylor swift. Like

1588
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,200
Speaker 5:  I she's right there.

1589
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:46,360
Speaker 7:  How was it?

1590
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:50,640
Speaker 5:  It was incredible. But like, they were like blowing glitter everywhere, like

1591
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,480
Speaker 5:  the whole thing. And like, literally they were like, please watch the

1592
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:58,200
Speaker 5:  TVs. And I was like, no, like,

1593
01:18:58,610 --> 01:18:59,680
Speaker 5:  absolutely not.

1594
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:03,600
Speaker 7:  They should have had her behind like a curtain. And it slowly raised

1595
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:04,480
Speaker 7:  the curtain. They didn't

1596
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,000
Speaker 5:  Reveal the tail

1597

Speaker 7:  Like, oh, she's right here. All along.

1598
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:10,280
Speaker 5:  It was like one of the strangest periods in all consumer technology when

1599
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,320
Speaker 5:  they were like, people are gonna buy the shit out of 3d TVs.

1600
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:17,080
Speaker 6:  They told Taylor, I'm just trying to imagine the pitch where the like Taylor

1601
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,720
Speaker 6:  swift. So you're you're Taylor swift. Right? Taylor swift,

1602
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:24,560
Speaker 6:  do you wanna come perform? But we're going to actively tell everyone to not

1603
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:25,920
Speaker 6:  watch while you perform.

1604
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:29,440
Speaker 5:  It was utterly. This was like the she's like, this was the high point of

1605
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:33,400
Speaker 5:  Sony CS. Like they never, after that, they're like, yeah, we've

1606
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:34,880
Speaker 5:  got a handful of new action cameras.

1607
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,400
Speaker 5:  Do you like PlayStations? There's one over there. Like

1608
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:42,640
Speaker 7:  That short throw projector. They show you

1609
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,640
Speaker 5:  Love the short throw projector

1610
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:46,480
Speaker 7:  Is the same one. Every time they're like, oh, is this a new one? No. Wow.

1611
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:50,360
Speaker 7:  But look, it's cool. Isn't it? No, it's been there for five years.

1612
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:54,680
Speaker 5:  They have that. They have that special room. Yeah. It's like dolled up like

1613
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,680
Speaker 5:  an ultra minimalist living room. And they're like this projector's only eight

1614
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,560
Speaker 5:  inches from the wall. And it's like, I don't know who has rooms like this.

1615
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,520
Speaker 9:  I wanna like, and it costs a hundred thousand

1616
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:02,720
Speaker 5:  Dollars.

1617
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,880
Speaker 5:  I will never forget that. It was just like one of the strangest moments.

1618
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:10,800
Speaker 7:  How much do you think she got paid for

1619
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,120
Speaker 5:  That enough? So that they had no budget for anything for years to come?

1620
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:17,000
Speaker 6:  What do you think? What do you think it's like when Taylor swift sends emails,

1621
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:21,400
Speaker 5:  This is what I need. She's on Tumblr. Like she

1622
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,720
Speaker 5:  occasionally is like, why haven't they ever inter updated the Tumblr in her

1623
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,920
Speaker 5:  face? Like she has to

1624
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,360
Speaker 7:  Be, she definitely has like a custom signature. Like she thought about that

01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:33,480
Speaker 6:  With a picture at the bottom. Oh yeah. And like a, like a really nice

1630
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,640
Speaker 5:  everyone has to have these experiences to

1631
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:49,320
Speaker 6:  Him. She's probably mad at catalyst. She's like my apps. They don't work.

1655
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:58,920
Speaker 5:  But I think we have to go see it in person to, to believe it's true.

1656
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:03,080
Speaker 7:  I think we have to do a lot more than that to believe it's true. Yeah.
