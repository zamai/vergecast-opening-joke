00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,880
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Rabbit Ear Antennas.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,760
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce, and I am doing maybe the weirdest thing on

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,440
Speaker 2:  my to-do list in a while. I am reordering all of the apps on my

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,240
Speaker 2:  Roku. I have 94 things installed it looks like, which is a

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,000
Speaker 2:  way too many, and B, total chaos because everything

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,360
Speaker 2:  is in a totally bonkers order and I can't find anything. So I'm moving stuff

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,240
Speaker 2:  around trying to get all of my important services up to the top. It is

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,200
Speaker 2:  way, way too much work. It's like six button clicks every time you want to

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,120
Speaker 2:  even just move an app, which is why it's taken me months to finally get fed

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,720
Speaker 2:  up enough to do it, but I'm doing it anyway. Today's show is actually

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,520
Speaker 2:  all about these streaming services. We've been trying for a while to figure

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,480
Speaker 2:  out a good way to answer a really simple but really important question. What

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,120
Speaker 2:  are the best streaming services? So we picked the most

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,920
Speaker 2:  subjective, most chaotic way we could think of to actually answer that question.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,120
Speaker 2:  Eli, Alex and I are going to draft streaming services and see who

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,040
Speaker 2:  picks the best roster for the future of entertainment. That's the whole show

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,560
Speaker 2:  today, and it's coming up in just a second. But first I have to figure out

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,320
Speaker 2:  whether Hulu or ESPN plus belongs on the second row of my

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,200
Speaker 2:  Roku. This feels like a surprisingly big decision. This is the cast.

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:15,960
Speaker 2:  See you in a sec.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,470
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. This is the Great Verge streaming

23
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,270
Speaker 2:  draft of 2023, which I'm saying so that it sounds like an annual

24
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,830
Speaker 2:  thing, so that we require ourselves to do this every year from now on

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,590
Speaker 2:  ne lapel. Hello and welcome to the draft. I've

26
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,350
Speaker 4:  Tried to pull that trick so many times. There's so many things we don't do

27
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,550
Speaker 4:  every year that I've insisted that we're gonna do every year, but we're gonna

28
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,270
Speaker 4:  do this every year.

29
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,910
Speaker 2:  Yeah, we're gonna do this every year. It's gonna be great. Alex Cranz. Hello.

30
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,950
Speaker 5:  What happens if all of the streaming services die next year? Will it

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,230
Speaker 5:  just be super competitive?

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,910
Speaker 2:  There's like a 60% chance that none of these things will exist. Okay, a year

33
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,910
Speaker 2:  from now, we'll be picking go 90 again. Yeah, it's gonna

34
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,950
Speaker 4:  Be great. The only thing on my list is Quibi, y'all. Let's just be honest.

35
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,230
Speaker 2:  I'm not gonna lie. The word Quibi appears in my notes somewhere in all the

36
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,350
Speaker 2:  prep that I did for this, but we'll, we'll come to that later. Okay, so let

37
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,590
Speaker 2:  me just quickly explain how this draft is gonna work and then we'll get into

38
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,550
Speaker 2:  it. We're gonna do five rounds and we're doing a snake draft. So the

39
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,590
Speaker 2:  person who picks first, then they go second, then they go third, and the

40
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,070
Speaker 2:  person who picks third then picks fourth. So we're, we're, we're going around

41
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,550
Speaker 2:  and around. We're gonna pick 15 total things over the course of this. And

42
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,830
Speaker 2:  the idea is that whatever you pick is what you're stuck with for the next

43
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,310
Speaker 2:  12 months. Like the imagine it like you're drafting a team, right? This is

44
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,270
Speaker 2:  your exclusive five streaming services for the next year. I will take

45
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,230
Speaker 2:  any single subscription as one draft pick. So you can draft

46
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,790
Speaker 2:  the Disney bundle as one thing because that is one thing with one price.

47
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,750
Speaker 2:  But also you can draft Disney Plus and ESPN Plus and Hulu as their own things

48
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,030
Speaker 2:  because you can pay for them separately. That's the only one like that that

49
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,990
Speaker 2:  I can actually think of. But if there are others, feel free and try to convince

50
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,640
Speaker 2:  me otherwise. But what you can't do is the, the like Amazon

51
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,840
Speaker 2:  channels, like subscribe to stars through here thing cuz that's a separate

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,520
Speaker 2:  thing that you pay for separately. So one bill, one price,

53
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,440
Speaker 2:  one pick.

54
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,760
Speaker 5:  Do like adjacent services count, things that

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,600
Speaker 5:  are like streaming but maybe don't have their own

56
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,200
Speaker 5:  content on them or a lot of their own content.

57
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,440
Speaker 2:  Sure. If you wanna pick Plex is the answer to your question. If you wanna

58
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,600
Speaker 2:  pick Plex, knock yourself out. That's an awful draft

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,240
Speaker 4:  Pick. You can't just pick Plex, you gotta pick. Alex has to pick her own

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Speaker 4:  Plex surfer, right?

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,600
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I pick my Plex surfer. Yeah, that I will allow. And as for

62
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,800
Speaker 2:  what counts, any streaming service counts, free, paid, whatever. It just

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,680
Speaker 2:  has to be primarily about entertainment. I'm gonna do my best to

64
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,920
Speaker 2:  keep track of the cost of all these things. And one fun wrinkle that I just

65
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,240
Speaker 2:  came up with is whoever spends the least money in these five picks

66
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,880
Speaker 2:  gets one extra free bonus pick at the end.

67
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,840
Speaker 4:  So you understand that the last pick of this draft is a punishment.

68
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,520
Speaker 2:  You get to have another streaming service, right? Instead of five streaming

69
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,480
Speaker 2:  services, you get to have six. You can pick, I don't know, quibi,

70
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,440
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna

71
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,120
Speaker 2:  Say something.

72
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,880
Speaker 4:  Punishment, not a reward.

73
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,600
Speaker 2:  That yeah, you're, you're not wrong. If there are any disputes, Andrew, our

74
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Speaker 2:  producer is in charge.

75
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,640
Speaker 6:  Thank you David.

76
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,360
Speaker 2:  He rules and his word is final. He's the, he's the commissioner of

77
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,680
Speaker 2:  our league. All right, Andrew is here to pick the draft

78
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,560
Speaker 2:  order. None of us know the draft order, cuz as far as I know there isn't

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,120
Speaker 2:  one yet. Andrew,

80
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,720
Speaker 5:  Give it to me. Give it to me. I deserve

81
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,440
Speaker 2:  It. Andrew, you're gonna tell us who's picking first, second, and third.

82
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,240
Speaker 2:  What do you have for us?

83
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,600
Speaker 6:  Okay, so NEI responded to your message in Slack

84
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,920
Speaker 6:  first today. So Neely's gonna go first.

85
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,600
Speaker 2:  Oh, what a surprise. Give the boss the first pick in the draft. Yes. What

86
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,480
Speaker 2:  a shocking twists everybody's boss gets to go first. This

87
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,720
Speaker 5:  Commissioners terrible

88
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,120
Speaker 4:  Surprise. That's right. I'm the Dallas Cowboys baby sleep.

89
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,680
Speaker 4:  You can't run this league without me.

90
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,720
Speaker 6:  And then Alex is gonna go second. Yes. And David is gonna go third

91
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,720
Speaker 6:  cuz he's the host.

92
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,760
Speaker 2:  This sucks. I don't wanna do this

93
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,120
Speaker 4:  Anymore. David. Trades are allowed, man.

94
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,040
Speaker 2:  I bet I'm still gonna get my first pick at third, so this is fine. Andrew,

95
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,880
Speaker 2:  do you have another song for us? It's Go Time

96
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,400
Speaker 2:  All Eli Patel, you're on the clock. First pick

97
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,080
Speaker 4:  TikTok.

98
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:11,760
Speaker 2:  Wow.

99
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,400
Speaker 4:  Zero hesitation TikTok,

100
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,400
Speaker 2:  Explain. Wow.

101
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,440
Speaker 4:  It provides the most value for the zero listed dollars. It is the only

102
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,080
Speaker 4:  streaming service that reliably produces videos of trucks trumping over things

103
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,920
Speaker 4:  and into rivers. That's very important to me. And I don't know if it's gonna

104
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,080
Speaker 4:  get banned or not, but I want to be, I wanna be on the ride if that's gonna

105
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,320
Speaker 4:  happen.

106
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,720
Speaker 2:  Well, so that's the, this is like the most high risk, high reward pick ever.

107
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,040
Speaker 2:  Right? Because there's a decent chance that literally it will not be available

108
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,880
Speaker 2:  to you when we do this draft again in 12 months. Yeah,

109
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,400
Speaker 4:  And you know what? Sometimes you gotta draft a quarterback who's definitely

110
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,360
Speaker 4:  gonna get hurt. You know what I'm saying? Like, I just think about where

111
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,080
Speaker 4:  do I spend the most time? It's TikTok as we go through the draft, I think

112
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,000
Speaker 4:  this choice will be rewarded. I might not need any other picks.

113
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,100
Speaker 2:  Okay? So my reasoning for being anti TikTok as the

114
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,740
Speaker 2:  first pick is that there's no, like prestige

115
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,700
Speaker 2:  TikTok is like not a thing. And like

116
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,620
Speaker 2:  what I want from one of my picks here, and maybe I'll get it later, but

117
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,980
Speaker 2:  is the like cultural relevancy of something where it's like everybody's very

118
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,220
Speaker 2:  excited about the most recent episode of succession and you're gonna have

119
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,060
Speaker 2:  to watch it in two minute increments cobbled together across the

120
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,180
Speaker 4:  Internet. Well, I do have other pegs, right? Like I can

121
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,100
Speaker 4:  pick Alex's Plex server second. We have not, actually, this is a

122
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,340
Speaker 4:  rules clarification. Am I still allowed to buy things?

123
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,140
Speaker 2:  Oh yes. You are allowed to buy things.

124
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,380
Speaker 4:  Like I can rent movies,

125
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,340
Speaker 2:  We'll leave like the voodoos of the world separate. If you wanna pay

126
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,140
Speaker 2:  four bucks to rent a movie that's allowed that,

127
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,380
Speaker 2:  that exists outside of this,

128
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,780
Speaker 4:  I'm ever more comfortable with this

129
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,540
Speaker 2:  Choice. Interesting. Okay. Alex, what do you think? Good choice. Bad choice.

130
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,220
Speaker 5:  Terrible choice. Just why I watched TikTok last night

131
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,500
Speaker 5:  while I was watching succession and that was a bad choice.

132
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,740
Speaker 2:  That might be a proof of New Life's point. You might have just proved me

133
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,300
Speaker 2:  ICE's case.

134
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,780
Speaker 5:  Basically it was, it was a bad choice. So like, I'm trying to, to

135
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,580
Speaker 5:  have less TikTok in my life.

136
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,620
Speaker 4:  That's fair. No, that's fair. Yeah. You gotta cut back.

137
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,700
Speaker 2:  Alex. Let's go second pick. What

138
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,780
Speaker 5:  Do you have? Oh, it's h b o max. Who?

139
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,500
Speaker 2:  Okay,

140
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,820
Speaker 5:  I'm coming out the gate Strong. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm aggressive.

141
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,740
Speaker 2:  All right. Defend

142
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,780
Speaker 5:  Because succession, but also I watch a lot of stuff

143
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,740
Speaker 5:  on, on HBO Max. There's, there's a lot of good content on it as long as it

144
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,980
Speaker 5:  survives. So I've got this for like, what another month.

145
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,980
Speaker 4:  Immediate theme in this draft of I need to ride this out while it

146
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,700
Speaker 2:  Lasts. Yeah.

147
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,700
Speaker 5:  So I'm gonna enjoy it for a month. I'm gonna watch, you know, maybe rewatch,

148
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,500
Speaker 5:  warrior rewatch sex lives of

149
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,340
Speaker 5:  college girls, whatever that show's called. That sounded really bad

150
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,780
Speaker 5:  saying it out loud, but it's gonna be a great time for the next month.

151
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,540
Speaker 2:  Okay, here's, here's a philosophical question. Are we streaming

152
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,340
Speaker 2:  services with ads people or spend the extra $5 for no ads? People?

153
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,940
Speaker 5:  Oh, this is with the extra $5. I don't do ads. Okay.

154
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,540
Speaker 2:  So we're, we're spending the money to not get any ads. Yeah. Unlike ne Eli

155
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,100
Speaker 2:  who says, just give me every ad,

156
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,700
Speaker 4:  Scroll right by 'em. Man, don't worry about it.

157
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,300
Speaker 5:  Every 30 videos just, there's your ad

158
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,500
Speaker 4:  Nii, you got a mag save charger. This is the best ad targeting you can do.

159
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,940
Speaker 2:  Nela, are you an ads person? Do you pay for no ads?

160
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,420
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. I, I pay for no ads everywhere. Okay. Which is funny because we

161
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,460
Speaker 4:  run an ad supported website. Please don't skip over the ads on this podcast,

162
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,660
Speaker 2:  But also pay for all of our paid things. Yeah. And those don't have ads.

163
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,020
Speaker 4:  Maybe I'm, I'm, I'm trying to bring these ideas together as much as I can.

164
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,220
Speaker 2:  Verge plus

165
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,900
Speaker 4:  That's my last pick. If I win this bonus pick, I'm picking that cuz it doesn't

166
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,780
Speaker 4:  cost any money. Okay. Because it doesn't exist. You see, you see the logic

167
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,260
Speaker 2:  Here. Alex, what do you do with the fact that the HBO Max app is like a

168
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,580
Speaker 2:  horrible pile of garbage that doesn't work? 40 to 60% of the time.

169
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,700
Speaker 5:  I just like close my eyes and think of the good content that

170
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,020
Speaker 5:  I'll get to when I eventually find it and the app works.

171
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,300
Speaker 2:  You watch TikTok until the page loads

172
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,400
Speaker 5:  Just avert my eyes and I press go and 30 minutes later maybe

173
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,080
Speaker 5:  my show plays and I'm really excited. And that like, once that 30 minutes

174
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,760
Speaker 5:  hit, then I've, I've got like, you get all those old movies cuz they have

175
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,400
Speaker 5:  like the whole, they have all the, the Turner Classic stuff.

176
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,080
Speaker 4:  This is a strong pick because of the catalog for sure. Yeah.

177
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,880
Speaker 5:  It's, it's all about the catalog for me and the app is like just an

178
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,680
Speaker 5:  unfortunate byproduct that I have to deal with.

179
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,920
Speaker 4:  Also, whenever you want, you can watch a square version

180
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,800
Speaker 4:  of Justice League.

181
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,960
Speaker 5:  That's all I've, that's what I'm gonna do right after this cuz it's my

182
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Speaker 5:  first pick. I can watch it any time.

183
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,000
Speaker 2:  Yeah, HBO X was gonna be my second pick specifically because it is like when

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,400
Speaker 2:  you make a list of like relevant cultural shows that people care about, they

185
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,320
Speaker 2:  are overwhelmingly on hbo. It's insane. So by not having HBO

186
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,720
Speaker 2:  O Max nea, you and I are just resigned to being sort of social

187
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,560
Speaker 2:  outcasts.

188
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,440
Speaker 4:  Don't worry, I got a Plex server coming up.

189
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,240
Speaker 2:  Alex is gonna rip everything from HBO O Max to her Plex server.

190
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,480
Speaker 2:  Problem solve

191
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,720
Speaker 5:  Would never do that. That's wrong.

192
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,840
Speaker 2:  Okay, so I'm up third and for my third pick I get my first pick,

193
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,240
Speaker 2:  which is YouTube. This is the easiest decision of all time. I cannot believe

194
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,080
Speaker 2:  neither of you picked YouTube. It's 2299 a month

195
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,840
Speaker 2:  for YouTube premium, which is insane. And which I did not realize I had been

196
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,120
Speaker 2:  paying all this time because they raised the price. Yeah. And which is, yeah,

197
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,960
Speaker 2:  it's outrageous. That's like the family plan. It's ridiculous. What do

198
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,600
Speaker 5:  You get for that?

199
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,960
Speaker 2:  So you get no ads. Okay. Which is great. You get background

200
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,760
Speaker 2:  listening, you get a music service for free, which is compelling.

201
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,320
Speaker 2:  And now I don't have to pick Spotify or Apple Music or anything else because

202
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,080
Speaker 2:  I just have YouTube music and all the music streaming services are the same.

203
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,000
Speaker 2:  So it's, it's kinda like getting two picks in one, but also it's like YouTube

204
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,720
Speaker 2:  over the last like 12 months for me has become the place

205
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,400
Speaker 2:  I go when I don't know what I wanna watch and I just have like 15 minutes

206
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,920
Speaker 2:  to kill. And I think part of this is, I just had a kid, so I, my windows

207
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,680
Speaker 2:  of time to just sort of sit and do nothing went from being like hours long

208
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,280
Speaker 2:  to like minutes long. But it's like highlights of

209
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,840
Speaker 2:  soccer games that I missed because I have a small child and

210
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,880
Speaker 2:  Hot Ones interviews is basically like my entire YouTube

211
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,200
Speaker 2:  algorithm right now. And it's great. And I have, I have nothing against it.

212
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,440
Speaker 2:  It feels like it is the biggest one. It's also the only one of our three

213
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,040
Speaker 2:  so far that will probably still exist 12 months from now. So I feel very

214
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,640
Speaker 2:  good about that. I'm honestly shocked neither of you picked this. I felt

215
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,600
Speaker 2:  like YouTube was like the obvious first choice.

216
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,880
Speaker 4:  It would've been my, it would've if I hadn't gotten, if I hadn't gotten TikTok,

217
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,000
Speaker 4:  I would've gone YouTube Premium.

218
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,880
Speaker 2:  Good. All right. Well then I also get the fourth pick because

219
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,840
Speaker 2:  of the way this draft works last. Yeah. Andrew, I've come around. I've decided

220
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,800
Speaker 2:  you, you were right to give me the third pick. Thank you.

221
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,560
Speaker 4:  That was secret. Wow.

222
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,800
Speaker 2:  So there's three I can choose from here and I'm gonna, this is the, I'm gonna

223
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,160
Speaker 2:  regret this choice, but I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna pick Peacock. Ooh.

224
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,520
Speaker 5:  Which

225
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,440
Speaker 2:  I would not have expected to do. But the honest truth is Peacock is

226
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,280
Speaker 2:  where the office is and it's where Parks and Rec is. And for me that is

227
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,200
Speaker 2:  like 45% of my TV viewing between those two shows.

228
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,400
Speaker 2:  And the, the other 45 exists on another service that I hope I get to pick

229
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,080
Speaker 2:  later. But it's just that like Peacock has some nifty stuff with

230
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,760
Speaker 2:  live tv, they have some sports, they're starting to grow. But it is like

231
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,000
Speaker 2:  fundamentally it is the place where the office is and I have to have the

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,960
Speaker 2:  place where the office is on my list. I already regret this choice as

233
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,360
Speaker 2:  I'm saying this, I drafted this too. High disclosure.

234
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:09,960
Speaker 4:  Oh

235
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,160
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

236
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,160
Speaker 4:  Peacock has operated by NBC Universal, which is owned by Comcast, which

237
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,560
Speaker 4:  is minority investor in Vox Media, parent company. David, I hope you got

238
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,720
Speaker 4:  some sort of kickback for this miserable

239
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,560
Speaker 5:  Choice. I think this is a good choice. This is, this is like,

240
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,120
Speaker 5:  if you watch a lot of tv, peacock is a very solid choice.

241
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,080
Speaker 4:  I think what we're we're gonna discover in this is that some of you watch

242
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,240
Speaker 4:  vastly more television than I do. Yeah,

243
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,480
Speaker 2:  That's probably, that's probably true. But no, for me it's like I dabble

244
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,320
Speaker 2:  in lots of TV and then I have like four shows that I cycle between over and

245
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,120
Speaker 2:  over and over and over again. And two of them are the office in Parks and

246
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,000
Speaker 2:  Rec, both of which are on Peacock. And I think I can reliably say

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,360
Speaker 2:  both of which are never leaving Peacock because they are part of the company

248
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,600
Speaker 2:  that owns Peacock. So I'm not afraid that six months from now they're just

249
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,840
Speaker 2:  gonna suddenly disappear. Unlike on some other services that have

250
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,200
Speaker 2:  gained and lost my

251
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,160
Speaker 5:  Shows until Peacock dies and they have to like sell to

252
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,720
Speaker 5:  another company.

253
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,760
Speaker 2:  There is that, but Peacock's doing kind of, well it

254
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,720
Speaker 2:  went from being like a total disaster to like a kind of me success ish.

255
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,080
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

256
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,920
Speaker 2:  It's like, it's like trending in the right direction from really bad to

257
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,000
Speaker 2:  kind of bad. It's like, you know, in Arrested Development, they go from like

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,480
Speaker 2:  a cell to don't buy and they're like thrilled about it. Like that's peacock.

259
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I just think you're gonna find yourself using the custom video player

260
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,800
Speaker 4:  UI that they developed for no reason. And you're like,

261
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,520
Speaker 4:  this is my third pick. Like, that's just how that's gonna feel for you.

262
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,640
Speaker 2:  Yeah. If the space bar on my iPad doesn't pause your video

263
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,160
Speaker 2:  player, you've done it wrong. And Peacock has done it wrong.

264
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,200
Speaker 2:  All right, Alex, you're up next.

265
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,760
Speaker 5:  I don't think this is gonna shock anybody but Paramount Plus. Yeah.

266
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,920
Speaker 2:  Wow. That does not shock

267
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,280
Speaker 4:  Me. Wow. The reaches in these rounds are out of control.

268
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,040
Speaker 2:  I had that so much lower on my list.

269
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,000
Speaker 5:  I get Star Trek Love a Star Trek. I get most of

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,920
Speaker 5:  Yellowstone The good, the good versions. Evil. That's lovely.

271
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,800
Speaker 5:  The good fight. A bunch of like random CBS stuff like Ghosts and

272
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,400
Speaker 5:  most importantly of all 60 Minutes.

273
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,160
Speaker 4:  So you're buying shows. Yeah.

274
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm, I'm all about the shows. Okay. For the most part. I got, I

275
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,960
Speaker 5:  got some others here, but for the most part it's about like the shows for

276
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,200
Speaker 5:  me, but all like, it's like peacock where you get a bunch of live stuff too,

277
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,240
Speaker 5:  so, so I can like watch live news if I need to, that sort

278
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Speaker 5:  of thing. Yeah. And then I gotta see what's gonna happen on Picard next week.

279
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,960
Speaker 5:  Like I can't, I can't lose that. I

280
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,800
Speaker 4:  Mean, I guess like saying you're buying shows at like, at the end we're all

281
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,720
Speaker 4:  just fine content. Yeah. Like no one's like I'm buying this for a great ui.

282
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,560
Speaker 4:  Like it's all content. But you very specifically are like these four shows

283
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,480
Speaker 4:  Yes. Are why I'm drafting this service.

284
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,240
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent. Also like the Peacock UI is fine.

285
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,440
Speaker 5:  It's better than HBO kind

286
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,240
Speaker 2:  Of in that, like the app loads from time to time. Yes.

287
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like once you actually use it, it's miserable and I hate it.

288
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,200
Speaker 5:  But otherwise it's, it's, it does the job.

289
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,480
Speaker 2:  So I will say when I first did my rankings, I had Paramount plus

290
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,320
Speaker 2:  really, really, really low. And then the Final four happened

291
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,320
Speaker 2:  and the masters happened, and both of those things only streamed on

292
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,480
Speaker 2:  Paramount Plus. And all of a sudden it's like, as a person who also likes

293
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,680
Speaker 2:  to watch like Champions League soccer, like Paramount Plus has a sneaky amount

294
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,600
Speaker 2:  of like really good, really high end sports that for

295
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,440
Speaker 2:  me are like, I actually don't subscribe to Paramount Plus. And there were

296
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,320
Speaker 2:  a couple of times the last couple of weeks I almost did and I suspect I'm

297
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Speaker 2:  gonna end up having to do so you'll

298
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,800
Speaker 5:  You'll

299
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,160
Speaker 2:  Like it. Even though I don't care about Star Trek. Like, to me Paramount

300
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,680
Speaker 2:  Plus is just like, where do you go if you like Star Trek and there's lots

301
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,440
Speaker 2:  of those people and I am not one of them. Yeah,

302
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,400
Speaker 5:  It's, it's, there's a bunch of other stuff. Like obviously the Star Trek

303
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,760
Speaker 5:  is really big right now at the moment for me. But for the most part it's

304
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,600
Speaker 5:  all of the other content that I, I watch and now I can keep up with

305
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,520
Speaker 5:  everybody in, in at home who all watch Yellowstone

306
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,200
Speaker 5:  and all of those shows so I can like, have conversations with my family.

307
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,160
Speaker 5:  That's very exciting.

308
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,160
Speaker 2:  That's real. Okay, here's the rules question. Are you paying

309
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,240
Speaker 2:  9 99 a month for just Paramount? Or are you paying 1199 a month and also

310
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,840
Speaker 2:  getting Showtime?

311
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,400
Speaker 5:  Oh, 1199 a month.

312
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,200
Speaker 4:  No, that's the easy, yeah, that's the easiest trade up of all time.

313
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,240
Speaker 2:  That's just the price for Yellow Jackets. Right? You pay $2 a month to watch

314
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,960
Speaker 2:  yellow jackets. A

315
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,840
Speaker 4:  Hundred percent. That's how they make billions.

316
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,480
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. I'm so sorry.

317
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,040
Speaker 5:  So smooth.

318
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,280
Speaker 2:  Okay, so you take Paramount plus of Showtime for 1199 a month.

319
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,400
Speaker 2:  I actually think that was a pretty good pick. Eli here up. What do

320
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,640
Speaker 4:  You got? Oh, this is hard. I can go two ways.

321
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,080
Speaker 2:  Well, okay. And you're gonna get a pick and then we're gonna take a break

322
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,640
Speaker 2:  and then you're gonna get another pick. So

323
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,600
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah, no, no, that's actually super easy then. Disney plus.

324
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,520
Speaker 2:  Okay, why

325
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,240
Speaker 4:  Child? Yes,

326
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,360
Speaker 7:  You

327
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,880
Speaker 4:  Have a child, child Bluey, I'm, I'm, I'm drafting Bluey. This

328
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,320
Speaker 2:  Is the Bluey

329
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,560
Speaker 4:  Pick. Very specifically Bluey, frozen, Moana,

330
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,480
Speaker 4:  like this stuff just flows through the house like water. Okay. Also

331
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,800
Speaker 4:  it is like the single app on her iPad that I trust

332
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,480
Speaker 4:  in like, in any way, shape or form, like YouTube Kids is

333
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,240
Speaker 4:  just a disaster clown car of a situation. Yes,

334
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,320
Speaker 4:  she loves it. But you've taken it off the board, right, because you took

335
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,760
Speaker 4:  YouTube totally off the board. So YouTube kids went for the ride.

336
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,360
Speaker 4:  Right. So you gotta, the kid pick has to be d

337
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,280
Speaker 2:  Plus. Okay. So and also, well I was, I have two follow up questions. One

338
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,720
Speaker 2:  is, are you just taking Disney Plus or are you taking the bundle and also

339
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,640
Speaker 2:  getting Hulu and ESPN Plus it's more expensive but

340
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,200
Speaker 2:  you get more stuff.

341
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I'm taking the bundle. Okay. Hulu's fine. My que

342
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,080
Speaker 4:  actually, my question was if I take the bundle, you can still pick Hulu,

343
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,680
Speaker 4:  right? That's right. Okay. So yeah, I'm taking the bundle not totally strategic.

344
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,480
Speaker 4:  If I was taking it totally off the board, zero, like that's just draft

345
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,360
Speaker 4:  strategy, right? Sure. But there's, yeah, Hulu has a reasonably good catalog.

346
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,000
Speaker 4:  It's got some movies on there. The real thing I'm taking is ESPN

347
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,960
Speaker 4:  Plus, which has the one show I watched during football season more consistently

348
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,320
Speaker 4:  than anything else. NFL primetime. Which is great.

349
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah, you two are the two people I know that are like ESPN plus.

350
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,720
Speaker 2:  It's

351
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,840
Speaker 4:  Great. Yeah, it just for one show.

352
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,240
Speaker 2:  Do you wanna watch college softball on a Saturday afternoon? Like they got

353
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,440
Speaker 2:  you. Yeah. Four night at night a month. Let's go. Also, you just made an

354
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,040
Speaker 2:  interesting point, which is you sound like a person who would be against

355
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,840
Speaker 2:  doing what everybody thinks is gonna happen, which is that Disney just pulls

356
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,440
Speaker 2:  all of the Hulu stuff into Disney Plus because it's a better and more successful

357
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,200
Speaker 2:  app anyway. But it sounds like in the, like it's the one app I trust on the

358
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,680
Speaker 2:  iPad fame. Maybe you don't want that to happen.

359
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,760
Speaker 4:  I we can age gate it already. So like she's already got the

360
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,560
Speaker 4:  kids version of D plus, which is like, there, there's a lot of age gates

361
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,080
Speaker 4:  built into it. Like they know that their audience is kids. So I'm not worried

362
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,920
Speaker 4:  about the catalog and the app expanding cuz I think that Disney of all companies

363
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,880
Speaker 4:  will be good at knowing that my daughter is five. You know, like it's, it's

364
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,680
Speaker 4:  actually hard for her to get some movies. Like some Pixar movies are rated

365
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,880
Speaker 4:  pg and she can't get them in her version of d plus, like, we have to use

366
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,320
Speaker 4:  my account. So I'm not so worried about that. I do think,

367
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,400
Speaker 4:  like, the reason I was like, whatever on Hulu is like Hulu will go

368
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,760
Speaker 4:  away before TikTok goes away.

369
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,680
Speaker 5:  Oh really? Yeah.

370
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:00,880
Speaker 2:  Like

371
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Or it will outlast us all. Those are the only two outcomes.

372
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,800
Speaker 2:  Season 61 of The Handmaids Tale coming

373
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,640
Speaker 4:  Soon. Exactly. Like every one of its corporate owners

374
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,720
Speaker 4:  has tried to kill Hulu and it has survived. It has outlasted all of them.

375
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,960
Speaker 4:  But I think in this particular round of the streaming wars,

376
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,640
Speaker 4:  neither Disney nor Comcaster League wants it to exist.

377
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,640
Speaker 4:  It just seems like the, if you're taking it, you should take it part as part

378
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,120
Speaker 4:  of this bundle, but it's a a it's a risky early round pick right now.

379
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,120
Speaker 2:  Alex, what do you think? This would've been my next pick. So I'm, I'm very

380
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,320
Speaker 2:  on board for this. Alex, what do you think?

381
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,240
Speaker 5:  I mean, I assumed one of you with children was gonna pick it, so

382
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,560
Speaker 5:  I was just waiting for one of you with children to pick it. I, I don't need

383
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,800
Speaker 5:  a lot of this stuff on there.

384
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,800
Speaker 2:  It does kind of feel like if you don't have kids or care about Marvel

385
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,520
Speaker 2:  and Star Wars, Disney Plus is actually like mostly useless to you.

386
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,360
Speaker 2:  But if either of those things apply to you, it is like the most important

387
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,040
Speaker 2:  thing in the universe.

388
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's like I can just go see those movies when they come out and like

389
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,200
Speaker 5:  the TV shows have all been fine.

390
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,560
Speaker 4:  People should know that if I could draft Disney Plus without drafting Star

391
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,360
Speaker 4:  Wars, I would do it. If I could just leave that on the

392
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,240
Speaker 4:  table, it would be fine. This is very much the Bluey draft

393
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,800
Speaker 4:  pick and if you have a child, you know how important this pick is.

394
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,640
Speaker 2:  That's fair. All right, we're through two rounds. We should take a break

395
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,400
Speaker 2:  and then we're gonna do the rest. Let me just recap the first two rounds.

396
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,440
Speaker 2:  So after two, after two rounds, NII has picked TikTok and the Disney bundle,

397
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,040
Speaker 2:  which is Disney plus, Hulu and ESPN plus. Alex has

398
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,840
Speaker 2:  HBO Max and Paramount plus slash Showtime and I have

399
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,640
Speaker 2:  YouTube and Peacock. I feel like I'm losing so far, I would say.

400
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,200
Speaker 2:  I also just wanna say, I was so thrown off by not getting the first pick.

401
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,240
Speaker 2:  You guys like, it's, it's bad. It's going bad for me, but I'm gonna, I'm

402
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,360
Speaker 2:  gonna come back strong from the break. I also just wanna say we are six picks

403
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,280
Speaker 2:  in and no one has picked Netflix and that's kind of wild. Yeah. But I suspect

404
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,360
Speaker 2:  that's coming up soon. Let's take a quick break and then we'll get back into

405
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,000
Speaker 2:  it. We'll be right back.

406
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,840

420
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,490
Speaker 9:  I'm Preed Barara, the former US attorney in Manhattan. My

421
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,250
Speaker 9:  podcast stay tuned is about law, justice and politics.

422
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,050
Speaker 9:  The Manhattan District Attorney's case against Donald Trump is one of the

423
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,010
Speaker 9:  most consequential, legal and political stories of our time. So

424
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,770
Speaker 9:  this week I was joined by two top legal experts, former US Attorney

425
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,530
Speaker 9:  Joyce Vance and Law Fair editor Ben Witi, to analyze the

426
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:19,890
Speaker 9:  charges.

427
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,010
Speaker 10:  While I don't think this is a no-brainer case to bring,

428
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,250
Speaker 10:  I do think there is a fairly solid basis

429
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,010
Speaker 10:  for it.

430
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,450
Speaker 9:  The potential evidence,

431
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,930
Speaker 11:  I think the jury hearing the evidence that at least if Brad can

432
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,690
Speaker 11:  prove what he's laid out in the statement of fact, the evidence will

433
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,530
Speaker 11:  be compelling on these charges.

434
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,450
Speaker 9:  And where we go from here, it's not clear that a conviction on

435
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,250
Speaker 9:  one or more of these felony counts would result in prison

436
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,490
Speaker 9:  sentence or a substantial prison sentence to listen. Just search. Stay

437
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,330
Speaker 9:  tuned wherever you get your podcasts. New episodes drop every

438
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:56,730
Speaker 9:  Thursday.

439
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,450
Speaker 9:  Stay tuned.

440
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,710
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Round three streaming draft. Andrew, do you have any

441
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,550
Speaker 2:  more music for us?

442
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,470
Speaker 2:  Yes,

443
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,030
Speaker 12:  It's the birthday streaming draft. Come at you live in New York

444
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,310
Speaker 12:  City,

445
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,110
Speaker 2:  Brought to you by Monster F

446
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,310
Speaker 2:  All right, Eli round three.

447
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,510
Speaker 4:  This is my reach. This is the one that is, it's an obvious

448
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,590
Speaker 4:  bad idea, but I'm doing it cuz it's, it's gonna blow the cost

449
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,230
Speaker 4:  structure for me. It's, it's, it's over, there's no way I'm getting the bonus

450
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,830
Speaker 4:  pick after this YouTube TV was Sunday ticket.

451
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,030
Speaker 2:  Ah, ooh, that's expensive, right?

452
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,910
Speaker 4:  It's like 80 bucks a month plus like $300 to for Sunday

453
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:44,750
Speaker 4:  ticket in Ren zone.

454
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,030
Speaker 2:  Yep.

455
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,240
Speaker 5:  Per month or

456
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,960
Speaker 2:  Just, yeah, it's, it's 72 99 a month right now for just

457
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,800
Speaker 2:  YouTube TV because the price goes up like every three to four days.

458
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,840
Speaker 2:  And Sunday ticket they just announced yesterday as this goes live,

459
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,760
Speaker 2:  the price for Sunday ticket is gonna be $289 in a presale and

460
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,640
Speaker 2:  3 89 if you buy it season. Are you sure you're you're sure about this pick?

461
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,360
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean they got me, what, what am I gonna do? I mean, I will say Alex

462
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,320
Speaker 4:  brought up Yellowstone. I watched all of Yellowstone on our YouTube

463
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,120
Speaker 4:  tv cuz Paramount channel's in there so you can just like DVR and skip

464
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,320
Speaker 4:  the ads. It is an election year. I feel like I'm gonna watch, end up watching

465
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,280
Speaker 4:  a lot of cnn. I appear on CNBC sometimes my wife likes

466
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,960
Speaker 4:  to watch me on television. Like I can concoct argue. It's like mostly

467
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,840
Speaker 4:  nonsensical arguments, right? Yeah. But I can concoct arguments for the

468
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,800
Speaker 4:  value of, of live cable television. But if not for Sunday ticket,

469
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,560
Speaker 4:  I would not be drafting this high, it's Sunday ticket that I'm drafting.

470
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,800
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's football for me it's Red zone. Just the, the like that's the

471
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,960
Speaker 2:  only way I watch football anymore. And there's a lot of money I would pay

472
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,040
Speaker 2:  and do pay every year to do it. But I can do it through YouTube.

473
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah, right. You can, you can buy the Red Sun Channel through YouTube. Right.

474
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,160
Speaker 4:  But you already have it right. Again, I'm off the cost curve. It doesn't

475
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,960
Speaker 4:  even matter. But I'm buying the version that comes with Red Zone cuz there's

476
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,920
Speaker 4:  a cheaper one that doesn't.

477
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,520
Speaker 2:  Yeah, you really did just kind of give yourself an insurmountable lead in

478
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,360
Speaker 2:  the spending a lot of money every month. $73 a month.

479
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,360
Speaker 4:  All right. All the rest of mine are gonna be free. Free V baby. Let's do

480
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,760
Speaker 4:  this thing.

481
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,120
Speaker 2:  Is the YouTube TV over like Hulu with live TV or any of those other ones?

482
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,320
Speaker 2:  Just purely it's, it's football.

483
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I, I can't imagine why I would pay for the one without football.

484
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,080
Speaker 4:  I think that's YouTube's calculation here.

485
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,400
Speaker 2:  I was gonna say, I feel like you just explained why YouTube spent all this

486
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,040
Speaker 2:  money on football

487
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,840
Speaker 4:  Also. I mean I've, I've used the other ones. They're fine. I think the YouTube

488
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,640
Speaker 4:  TV interface is better. Does it matter? Like Yeah,

489
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,800
Speaker 4:  it's football. I'm buying football.

490
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,320
Speaker 2:  Alex, did you have live TV on your list at all?

491
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,080
Speaker 5:  Kind of.

492
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,400
Speaker 2:  I feel like if you don't care about sports, why would you? I

493
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,160
Speaker 5:  Mean I've got Paramount plus I've got another pick potentially. But

494
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,840
Speaker 5:  yeah, I don't really care about sports so I don't really care about most

495
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,240
Speaker 5:  live tv.

496
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,680
Speaker 2:  The $75 a month for live TV is not blowing your mind.

497
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,040
Speaker 5:  No. Okay. I just pirate it. Okay. I mean I can just watch it over

498
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,400
Speaker 5:  the air. Over the

499
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,600
Speaker 2:  Air. You haven't drafted your Plex server yet. Don't forget it's still out

500
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,120
Speaker 2:  there. All right, well then let's move on. What's your next pick?

501
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,600
Speaker 5:  Okay, this one's a toughie. I'm gonna do something really, speaking of live

502
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,280
Speaker 5:  tv, I'm gonna do something really cheap. I'm gonna do, not Plex

503
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,240
Speaker 5:  but Channels, which is a DVR service because

504
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,120
Speaker 5:  it can work with TV everywhere. So anything that potentially is

505
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,640
Speaker 5:  TV everywhere accounts, I can DVR those.

506
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,400
Speaker 4:  But then you need a cable subscription.

507
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,040
Speaker 5:  Not necessarily, it's not just cable. It's a bunch of other stuff too. Oh,

508
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,640
Speaker 5:  I see. So I, I think it might work with Parallel Plus I can find out. But

509
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,520
Speaker 5:  then it also gives me all the live TV and it gives me access to like

510
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,480
Speaker 5:  two B and all of those things, which gives you CNN and all of that.

511
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,440
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Wait, so explain how channels works for people who don't know this

512
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,840
Speaker 2:  is, this is like deep streaming nerd stuff. You gotta, you gotta walk us

513
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,120
Speaker 2:  through it.

514
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,760
Speaker 5:  So it's basically a D V R service

515
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,920
Speaker 5:  and you can plug in, if you've got a HD home run tuner

516
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,880
Speaker 5:  you, you just plug that in and it automatically pulls down anything you get

517
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,840
Speaker 5:  over the air and you can DVR that. But you can also attach

518
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,360
Speaker 5:  M three U playlists, which is what, two B and Pluto

519
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,120
Speaker 5:  and all of those free services offer. So you can then

520
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,040
Speaker 5:  have all of those channels as well and just like watch

521
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,920
Speaker 5:  all of the channels. Like you watch normal tv so I can watch all of the

522
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,840
Speaker 5:  Carol Burnett show I want and that's all I care about in the

523
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,200
Speaker 4:  World. This is a power move.

524
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,880
Speaker 2:  This definitely like violates the spirit of the game, but I like it. So we're

525
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,000
Speaker 2:  gonna allow it. Yeah,

526
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,800
Speaker 4:  This is great. But you should definitely draft a kicker in the first round.

527
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,240
Speaker 4:  Like, I

528
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,080
Speaker 2:  Don't know a hundred percent. Yeah. I'm just drafting all the

529
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,200
Speaker 2:  teams all at once. Yeah,

530
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. All of them. It's, it's an absolute cheat and if you

531
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,560
Speaker 5:  tell me no, I'll, I'll, I'll accept it. I'll accept it.

532
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,680
Speaker 4:  No, this is absolutely, this is a paid streaming service. It's in the rules.

533
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah. This totally counts. Yeah.

534
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,800
Speaker 5:  It's a paid service and it requires way more work and

535
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,560
Speaker 5:  effort than any of the other ones we've discussed here so far. Yeah.

536
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,320
Speaker 2:  I've never gotten past the sort of like initial setup hurdle of channels

537
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,320
Speaker 2:  cuz it is, like you said, you need special hardware. You need to like, have

538
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,160
Speaker 2:  done real work to get it set up once it's like up and running. Is it

539
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,040
Speaker 2:  easy or do you have to like Tomagotchi style tend to your channels? Yeah,

540
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,560
Speaker 5:  It's totally easy. Like I was getting, there was some

541
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,320
Speaker 5:  sport, I don't remember which one that my brother couldn't get with

542
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,280
Speaker 5:  Fios at his house, but I could get it over the air. And so

543
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,040
Speaker 5:  I just sent him the code, like the IP address for my

544
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,960
Speaker 5:  server and he was just watching his sport live and was totally

545
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,560
Speaker 5:  fine. And he lives many miles away from me. So it

546
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,160
Speaker 5:  works super, super easy once you get it set

547
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,000
Speaker 2:  Up. I mean I I I do feel like anything that starts with the phrase I sent

548
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,960
Speaker 2:  him, the IP address of my server is objectively not super,

549
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,720
Speaker 2:  super easy.

550
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It was just like a phone number. He was just like, I need a number

551
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,240
Speaker 5:  for this. What's the number? And I sent him the number and he's like, okay,

552
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,560
Speaker 5:  done.

553
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,720
Speaker 2:  That's fair. Type these numbers. Yeah. Yeah.

554
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:47,000
Speaker 5:  So it it works, it works great. Okay. But you do have to get it set up.

555
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,920
Speaker 2:  We should probably should have said at the top that we all get the, the over

556
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,400
Speaker 2:  the air broadcast channels for free. Right? That's yeah. That's just you,

557
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,080
Speaker 2:  you can't help but have those, they're just there. Yeah.

558
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,200
Speaker 4:  You can't draft an antenna.

559
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah, right. You can't draft an antenna, you just have one.

560
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:03,240
Speaker 5:  So I'm just, I'm just enjoying all of them waiting for ATS

561
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,080
Speaker 5:  3.0. ATSC 3.0 to save our lives. It's never gonna

562
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,480
Speaker 5:  happen. Oh

563
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,400
Speaker 2:  Boy. I look forward to you drafting ATSC 3.0 every draft for the

564
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Speaker 2:  next 20 years.

565
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,160
Speaker 5:  You're just throwing away all of your picks on that one.

566
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,560
Speaker 2:  Ooh, I get two picks now and I have three that I'm choosing from. And I need

567
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,520
Speaker 2:  the two of you to help me. We're just gonna talk through this together. We're,

568
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,560
Speaker 4:  I'm your enemy. Yeah,

569
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,840
Speaker 2:  No, just we're just, we're gonna talk this through. It's ultimately my decision

570
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,560
Speaker 2:  and I know you're lying to me so it's, we'll, we'll get there. So there's,

571
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,280
Speaker 2:  there's Netflix, there's Amazon Prime video and there's Discovery

572
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,200
Speaker 2:  Plus These are the three I'm debating between. Wow. Really These are all

573
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,960
Speaker 2:  the kind of like volume plays, right? Like, like a Prime video

574
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,800
Speaker 2:  just has a billion movies to watch. Most of them are bad, but they're there.

575
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,760
Speaker 2:  Netflix has infinite stuff including like every bad

576
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,960
Speaker 2:  reality show that I like right now. And then Discovery Plus is

577
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,040
Speaker 2:  basically for me, it's like the HGTV and murder shows

578
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,960
Speaker 2:  for my wife service. So these all kind of serve of the same purpose.

579
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,680
Speaker 5:  But you already have YouTube, right? Like YouTube has all the HG

580
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,480
Speaker 5:  TV kind of shows only they're made by, they're like

581
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,440
Speaker 5:  uglier because they're made by just a dude in his house.

582
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah. There's just worse. Like I have watched a lot of the Architectural

583
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,440
Speaker 2:  Digest celebrities show you their house tours. Love. I love that videos.

584
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But sometimes I wanna see people try and fail to flip their own

585
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,440
Speaker 2:  house.

586
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,840
Speaker 2:  It's very important to me. I think I have to pick Netflix here just because

587
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,720
Speaker 2:  Netflix is like, yeah, it's both a giant of the

588
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,120
Speaker 2:  space and also just has a mountain of content that really nobody else can

589
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,320
Speaker 2:  touch.

590
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,560
Speaker 4:  This is your background music choice. This is what you're saying. You just

591
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,360
Speaker 4:  want stuff that's on.

592
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,160
Speaker 2:  Yeah, this is my like something good to watch, but I

593
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,120
Speaker 2:  don't have a specific desire for what I wanna watch

594
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,160
Speaker 2:  because the flip side is like Apple TV Plus is still sitting there, right?

595
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,080
Speaker 2:  And Apple TV plus is like three shows that I love. And that's it. That's

596
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,040
Speaker 2:  the whole service. Yeah,

597
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,080
Speaker 4:  That's the, I'm drafting content. This is, this is why I asked Alex that

598
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,040
Speaker 4:  question earlier, right? Like Right, you can either draft content or you

599
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,480
Speaker 4:  get to this point and you're like just stuff.

600
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,640
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I think, I think for me, I'm still in the just

601
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,840
Speaker 2:  stuff mode. I just don't have enough show

602
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,720
Speaker 2:  loyalty is the thing that I'm realizing. Like I don't have that many things

603
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,640
Speaker 2:  that I care so much about that I can't, like

604
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,480
Speaker 4:  I used the first pick of the draft on stuff. Like that's what, it's just

605
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,000
Speaker 4:  stuff like I get, I

606
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,880
Speaker 2:  Feel you. I think what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna do Netflix and I'm

607
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,400
Speaker 2:  gonna do Discovery Plus. Wow. And I now have just

608
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,360
Speaker 2:  several lifetimes worth of relatively mediocre stuff to

609
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,920
Speaker 2:  watch. And also whenever the next Squid game comes out, I have that

610
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,520
Speaker 4:  Disclosure. We, I'm in a Netflix ep, this show's called The Future Oven.

611
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,000
Speaker 4:  David Chick watched. It's

612
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,920
Speaker 2:  Very good. I can watch it now. I'm the only one of us who's allowed to watch

613
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,880
Speaker 2:  it from now on. Yeah. So there we go. I took it. I have Netflix. This is

614
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,800
Speaker 2:  good. I feel better now. I was doing bad after two rounds. Now I feel like

615
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,120
Speaker 2:  I'm winning.

616
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,600
Speaker 5:  It wasn't even on my list.

617
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,880
Speaker 2:  Netflix wasn't on your

618
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,880
Speaker 5:  List. It wasn't even on my list. Wow. I got really mad at, they canceled

619
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,920
Speaker 5:  some show I liked and so I stopped watching it for like three weeks and I

620
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,960
Speaker 5:  was like, oh, I don't actually miss it that much.

621
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,040
Speaker 2:  So that has been consistently my thing. I will say the, the reason I was

622
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,000
Speaker 2:  bummed to not get HBO O Max was that it's really the only one that I

623
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,840
Speaker 2:  would like super, super notice if I didn't have it anymore.

624
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All the rest are like varying levels of good shows. But HBO Max is

625
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,600
Speaker 2:  the one that's like, like I watched Succession religiously and almost

626
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,240
Speaker 2:  all of the shows that I watch religiously on purpose are on H B O,

627
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,160
Speaker 2:  which is crazy and wild and kudos to HBO O for

628
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,600
Speaker 2:  continuing to be the only one to do that. But yeah, Netflix is like, it's

629
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,080
Speaker 2:  just a lot of stuff and it's better stuff than most of the other

630
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,800
Speaker 2:  companies stuff, but it's still just stuff. Yeah. So I think I feel good

631
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,680
Speaker 2:  about that. I'm taking Netflix for 20 bucks a month and Discovery Plus for

632
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,080
Speaker 2:  seven bucks a month. And now my wife has all of the murder documentaries

633
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,720
Speaker 2:  she could possibly want. You're welcome Anna. I love you.

634
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,800
Speaker 4:  Here's a question, did you expect Netflix to fall this far? I definitely

635
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,000
Speaker 4:  did. Is what? I'll tell you I have, I ha it's on my list, but like, it's

636
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,080
Speaker 4:  like a late round Nice to have pickup.

637
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,960
Speaker 2:  Well, so that was the thing that was most surprising to me in going through

638
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,440
Speaker 2:  this was how few incredibly compelling

639
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,360
Speaker 2:  reasons there were to pick Netflix. Like Yeah. And

640
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,480
Speaker 2:  this is the thing we've talked about a lot on this show, right? Like Netflix

641
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:16,320
Speaker 2:  is great at having lots of shows and being available everywhere and it's

642
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,080
Speaker 2:  AppWorks pretty well, but they're still in search of like

643
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,720
Speaker 2:  the things that draw people to come to it on purpose and really

644
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,560
Speaker 2:  like create cultural moments. They have, they've had some

645
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,840
Speaker 2:  wins. Like Squid Game was huge. Tiger was huge. Like they have these

646
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,520
Speaker 5:  Beats Wednesday.

647
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Stranger Things Wednesday. Outer banks. Like if you're a teenager in

648
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,080
Speaker 4:  America, you're, they've got you.

649
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:41,080
Speaker 2:  I've been watching The Night Agent recently. It's very good. It's just the

650
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,720
Speaker 2:  like pulp spy show. But it's excellent. But yeah, and I don't know, I just

651
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Speaker 2:  feel like part of this, I'm definitely holding out hope that the next Gray

652
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Speaker 2:  Man movie on Netflix is better than the first one because I love that book

653
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,880
Speaker 2:  series and I hate that movie.

654
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,560
Speaker 4:  No, no, no. They, they, this whole thing that they do where they're like,

655
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,480
Speaker 4:  rich people make movies for lots of money. The Rock. You have an idea.

656
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,240
Speaker 4:  Put Cal Gao like stop it. Like you don't know what you're doing.

657
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,040
Speaker 2:  Yeah. None of them have been any good.

658
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,760
Speaker 4:  What was the Michael Bay one with the numbers in the title?

659
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,600
Speaker 2:  Oh, was it six Underground Guys?

660
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,440
Speaker 4:  Yes. Six times the numbers in the title. That's what I got for you.

661
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,360
Speaker 2:  That movie, like the description of Six Underground is

662
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,560
Speaker 2:  like meant for me specifically as a person. Yeah.

663
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,200
Speaker 4:  And you don't have any recollection of that happening to you at

664
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,880
Speaker 2:  All? No, I really don't. It was, it was bad is all I remember.

665
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,480
Speaker 2:  But I feel good about picking it up here cuz I feel like I'm, I'm always

666
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,520
Speaker 2:  gonna have something to watch and it'll always be fine.

667
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,200
Speaker 5:  Totally adequate content.

668
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,240
Speaker 2:  All right, so now we are, we are into round four already. Alex,

669
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,160
Speaker 2:  you're up next. What do you got?

670
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,280
Speaker 5:  Ooh, I'm gonna go Criterion. Oh, I pay for

671
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,840
Speaker 5:  it already. I really enjoy it. It's probably got the

672
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,800
Speaker 5:  best set of Hong Kong action films that you can

673
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,080
Speaker 5:  find in streaming. It's really hard to find those in streaming. And it's

674
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,840
Speaker 5:  actually got a whole bunch of 'em. Especially they like a bunch of Michelle

675
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,560
Speaker 5:  yo stuff is just popped up on there. It's got a lot of like old classic

676
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,240
Speaker 5:  musicals, which that's like some people watch YouTube. I just

677
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,480
Speaker 5:  go and like, watch specific dance scenes from old classic musicals and

678
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,200
Speaker 5:  I can just do that on Criterion and it's got a bunch of documentaries. Like,

679
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,840
Speaker 5:  I'm enjoying My Choice. This

680
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,920
Speaker 2:  Is a good pick. I didn't even have Criterion on my list. But that's a, that's

681
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,320
Speaker 2:  a really good pick. And Criterion also does a really good job with like,

682
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,160
Speaker 2:  they have a lot of bonus features they do. Cool. Like behind the scenes stuff,

683
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,880
Speaker 2:  it's like, it is probably like the film buffs, most

684
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,000
Speaker 2:  film buffs.

685
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:27,560
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Thing. There's like a ton of movies on there. I will never ever watch.

686
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,440
Speaker 5:  But I, I like that I could, if I really wanted to. If I wanna go

687
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,400
Speaker 5:  watch some French NuWave, I can do that. I'm not going to, but

688
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,160
Speaker 5:  I like that. I know I

689
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,080
Speaker 2:  Can. But you, you can Neela Did you have Criterion on your list?

690
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,880
Speaker 4:  I did not.

691
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,600
Speaker 2:  Yeah, you should have waited on Criterion. It's a good pick, but I had not

692
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,320
Speaker 2:  even, it had not even occurred to me to think about it.

693
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,280
Speaker 4:  Once we get in these rounds, it's all bets are off. Like Alex is just off

694
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,640
Speaker 4:  in the woods, she's like, all right channels and the criterion streaming

695
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,200
Speaker 4:  service like

696
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,480
Speaker 5:  Wee over in a corner. I'm having a great time.

697
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,920
Speaker 4:  No, it's, it's an excellent pick by the way. I think that's

698
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,520
Speaker 5:  Very smart. Yeah, it's just a big nerdy art pick.

699
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,520
Speaker 2:  And ironically maybe the single most likely candidate to still

700
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,120
Speaker 2:  be around a bunch of years from now. Like, I don't know if I would pick against

701
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,920
Speaker 2:  Criterion in this longevity fight. Yeah,

702
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,160
Speaker 5:  Because they got killed once and they came back like, yeah, they're gonna,

703
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,560
Speaker 5:  they're gonna live forever now.

704
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,480
Speaker 2:  People still like black and white movies, including my father-in-law

705
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,920
Speaker 2:  who every time we go visit is like, have you seen this movie from 1936? And

706
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,640
Speaker 2:  I was like, Nope, haven't seen it. He's like, well let's watch it tonight.

707
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,480
Speaker 2:  So I'm getting a film education. It's lovely. All right, now

708
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,560
Speaker 2:  O'Neil, you get two now. Wait,

709
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,920
Speaker 4:  I feel like this is unfair cuz we, you and I keep getting two in our own.

710
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,600
Speaker 4:  Alex is going in between us. I'm

711
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,400
Speaker 2:  Like, hi. Yeah, but it means we have to wait longer. Yeah.

712
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,600
Speaker 4:  I feel like this draft order makes more sense when you have more people.

713
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,360
Speaker 2:  I will say, I think Alex has gotten every single thing she wanted. So

714
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,680
Speaker 5:  That's

715
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,920
Speaker 4:  I'll bad.

716
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,560
Speaker 5:  I've been, you guys are off in sports land over there and I'm a little gremlin.

717
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,400
Speaker 4:  I'm like doing strategy. All right. I have a rules

718
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,480
Speaker 4:  question. She, you said this about YouTube that you get a music service for

719
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,320
Speaker 4:  free. Are we only drafting video services or

720
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,960
Speaker 4:  do I have to put a music service in the mix?

721
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,440
Speaker 2:  If you want a music service, you can draft a music service.

722
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,880
Speaker 4:  But if I don't, like are we just assuming that everyone has a Spotify subscription

723
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,560
Speaker 4:  on the side? Or if I don't draft one, do I not listen to music?

724
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,760
Speaker 2:  If you don't draft one, you get ad supported Pandora. That's, that's that's

725
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,200
Speaker 2:  the baseline.

726
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,840
Speaker 4:  All right. Just I that was important cuz you, you took YouTube music.

727
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah. All right then I'm taking Apple Music easy. Ah,

728
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,480
Speaker 5:  She knew I should have picked that last.

729
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,280
Speaker 2:  Why Apple Music?

730
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,840
Speaker 4:  I'm an Apple Music person. I, I I I think the interface is calmer. It

731
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,560
Speaker 4:  doesn't seem like the music industry is perpetuating some sort of three card

732
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,760
Speaker 4:  Monty situation with me every time I open it. Fair. I like that they have

733
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,240
Speaker 4:  lossless. I can't tell you if I can actually hear it or not, but I, I like

734
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,200
Speaker 4:  that it's there, it's like a binky for me and you know, I'm an

735
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,840
Speaker 4:  old head so it sort of seamlessly imported my iTunes library

736
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,720
Speaker 4:  from way back then. I still just like gaze upon it from time to

737
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:50,880
Speaker 4:  time.

738
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah. How much of the music service choice is like

739
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,280
Speaker 2:  inertia as opposed to anything else? Cause I even had this thought when

740
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,000
Speaker 2:  I picked YouTube and got YouTube music, I was like, ugh, do I still need

741
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,320
Speaker 2:  to pick Spotify? Cuz I've like had Spotify for 10 years and it's gonna be

742
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,040
Speaker 2:  a gigantic pain in the ass to switch. Is it just the switching costs? Like

743
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,560
Speaker 2:  if you were starting over, would you still pick Apple Music? Well,

744
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,440
Speaker 4:  It depends. I think the switching cost, it's not money, right? It's

745
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,120
Speaker 4:  like well have my music, like I am not a curated playlist

746
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,720
Speaker 4:  person unless I'm just like yelling at a voice assistant to start playing

747
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,360
Speaker 4:  some music, you know? Sure. I'm like, I'm gonna listen to this album. I wanna

748
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,800
Speaker 4:  listen to these songs. So there's just a part of me that's very much, it's

749
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,440
Speaker 4:  hard to switch unless you know that I want the entire like

750
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,280
Speaker 4:  clash catalog, the entire Cure catalog. Like I'm still

751
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,760
Speaker 4:  there. I'm still doing that thing. And so that if, if that was easier, I

752
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,560
Speaker 4:  would happily switch. But having like open an app and like go tell it which

753
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,240
Speaker 4:  18 records I want to prepopulate and have downloaded again is a very high

754
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,360
Speaker 4:  switching cost and I don't have to pay it with Apple Music.

755
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,920
Speaker 2:  All right. Mila, you have another pick, but we're gonna pause between your

756
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,360
Speaker 2:  picks again. We're gonna take one more break and then we're gonna come do

757
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,120
Speaker 2:  the last round and then all the insane cleanup we have to do to make any

758
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,920
Speaker 2:  of this make any sense. We'll be right back.

759
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,960
Speaker 13:  All right, Naima, I need three reasons why people should listen to On with

760
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,120
Speaker 13:  Kara Swisher, what have you

761
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,480
Speaker 14:  Got? Okay. First you interview smart, powerful people like Hillary Clinton,

762
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,320
Speaker 14:  mark Benioff and Stacey Abrams. Second, you grill them harder than most

763
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,200
Speaker 14:  people would dare. And third, the podcast will make you think, it'll make

764
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,160
Speaker 14:  you laugh and it'll make you smarter. How's that?

765
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:34,000
Speaker 13:  That's like five things, but good enough on with Kara Swisher

766
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,480
Speaker 13:  wherever you get your podcast.

767
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,600
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's just recap. We've done four rounds. We have

768
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,480
Speaker 2:  one more round to go. So far Eli has picked TikTok, the Disney bundle,

769
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:53,600
Speaker 2:  YouTube tv, and Apple Music. And just based on my

770
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,440
Speaker 2:  math here is spending like a little over a hundred dollars a month so far.

771
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,600
Speaker 2:  So great job.

772
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,440
Speaker 4:  I'm living the brand name lifestyle, man. I'm the luxury mall.

773
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,320
Speaker 2:  You really are you. It's really true. Alex has picked HBO Max

774
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,040
Speaker 2:  Paramount plus slash Showtime, the channels app and the

775
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,320
Speaker 2:  Criterion Collection because Alex exists on a different planet from the rest

776
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,520
Speaker 2:  of us.

777
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,640
Speaker 4:  Alex lives in Brooklyn.

778
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,920
Speaker 13:  Yes, true.

779
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,080
Speaker 2:  And Alex is spending in the realm of like

780
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,000
Speaker 2:  $45 a month, somewhere in that range. I have

781
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,720
Speaker 2:  YouTube, peacock, Netflix, and Discovery Plus because I live in the Midwest

782
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,440
Speaker 2:  and I am, I am, I am an American mom.

783
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,560
Speaker 13:  You got the little haircut to the side. Yeah.

784
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,840
Speaker 2:  And let's see, I'm spending 60 bucks all in. So

785
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,320
Speaker 2:  I would say it's very unlikely that Nii loses the, who spends the most.

786
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:45,720
Speaker 2:  So congrats to Ni Eli already. And now we are onto our

787
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,720
Speaker 2:  fifth and final round. Nii, you're up. What do you got?

788
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,440
Speaker 4:  All right. I'm picking between two. They're radically different, but I'm

789
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,520
Speaker 4:  gonna do it. I'm just gonna say this out loud. I'm picking my buddy Viens

790
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:55,880
Speaker 4:  Plex server.

791
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,720
Speaker 13:  It's

792
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,240
Speaker 4:  Really good. I can just text him.

793
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,880
Speaker 2:  Tell us about villain's Plex Server.

794
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:05,360
Speaker 4:  So I've known Vivin for a long time. He's, he's been running this thing for

795
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,760
Speaker 4:  a long time. He has, it's au all automatic, it's all legal content. It's

796
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,720
Speaker 4:  just Linux distributions. Yeah. And whenever I want a new Linux distribution,

797
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,360
Speaker 4:  I just text him and it appears

798
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,440
Speaker 13:  Channels does that too.

799
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,520
Speaker 4:  You

800
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,480
Speaker 2:  Don't have to ask questions about where they come from.

801
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,600
Speaker 4:  Look, every now and again, I'm like, oh, I need the latest version of Red

802
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:22,760
Speaker 4:  Hat.

803
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:28,800
Speaker 4:  Vi's daughter is about the same age as my daughter. So it's, it's often that

804
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,680
Speaker 4:  he has the same needs of Linux on his Plex

805
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:32,840
Speaker 4:  server.

806
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,880
Speaker 2:  How are Viens metadatas?

807
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,200
Speaker 4:  My understanding is that much of the metadata

808
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,000
Speaker 4:  cleanup you need to reliably distribute Linux around your home

809
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,240
Speaker 4:  is automated.

810
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,840
Speaker 2:  Sometimes you just wanna watch Linux, you know what I mean? Sometimes it's

811
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,120
Speaker 2:  Friday night and you just wanna put on Linux and watch it for two hours.

812
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,720
Speaker 4:  Every now and again, you're just like, yeah,

813
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,160
Speaker 5:  Are you paying for Plex Pass?

814
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,880
Speaker 4:  No, no, no, no,

815
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,360
Speaker 5:  No. So no, no offline.

816
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,560
Speaker 4:  No. Yeah. This is just a, this is just a, a cleanup pick at the end here,

817
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,000
Speaker 4:  you know? Yeah. If you draft your first round quarterback and you pick one

818
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,160
Speaker 4:  in the seventh round, just to put some competition and make sure that's what,

819
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,920
Speaker 4:  that's why I'm doing this.

820
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,320
Speaker 2:  I like it. What was your other choice if you didn't pick that?

821
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,080
Speaker 4:  Hilariously randomly. Sirius xm. What? Yeah,

822
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,160
Speaker 4:  that, and that's straight up. There's like three shows that Becky listens

823
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,640
Speaker 4:  to that are only unserious. You

824
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,200
Speaker 2:  Just almost picked Apple Music and Sirius XM back to back. Yeah. Do you live

825
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,680
Speaker 2:  in a car?

826
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,920
Speaker 4:  I picked the general hilarity of the Linux conversation over the actual

827
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,680
Speaker 4:  need of making my wife happy.

828
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,640
Speaker 2:  What does she listen to on Sirius?

829
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,440
Speaker 4:  There's like a bunch of comedy podcasts that she listens to on Sirius. They're

830
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,560
Speaker 4:  only on Sirius, so she like, that's why we have it. And then I do actually

831
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,600
Speaker 4:  live in the car. And so I listen to a lot of Sirius in

832
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,800
Speaker 2:  The car. What's your go-to? What do you listen to? Are you a yacht rock guy?

833
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,640
Speaker 4:  Not yacht, rock, lithium, the, obviously the Turner Rock. Oh. And

834
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,480
Speaker 4:  First Wave. Nice. You can tell where my music tastes like fully lie.

835
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,960
Speaker 4:  The other thing that's completely insane to do, if you have a serious subscription,

836
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,080
Speaker 4:  you spend a lot of time in the car and you just need voices, is you can listen

837
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:03,920
Speaker 4:  to CNBC as an audio stream. And that is the

838
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,760
Speaker 4:  most insane podcast that you can listen to. Like Jim Kramer

839
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,480
Speaker 4:  eight in the morning, just like yelling about money is

840
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,440
Speaker 4:  like, I definitely don't feel sleepy, I'll tell you that much.

841
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,000
Speaker 2:  And it's Jim Kramer saying, look at this chart. And you saying, Jim, I can't

842
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah, exactly.

843
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:20,920
Speaker 2:  Can't see the

844
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,400
Speaker 4:  Chart. It is a vastly different experience to listen to it as an audio feed

845
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:24,800
Speaker 4:  in the morning.

846
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:28,560
Speaker 2:  Okay. I just wanna say about Sirius XM that I bought a car, which meant that

847
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,920
Speaker 2:  I got three free months of Sirius xm, which I used zero times because I couldn't

848
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,440
Speaker 2:  even figure out how to set it up. And then since it elapsed,

849
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,600
Speaker 2:  I would say I either get a phone call or a piece of physical mail from SiriusXM

850
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,560
Speaker 2:  asking me to resubscribe every single day. And I have

851
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,160
Speaker 2:  now become resolute that I will never, ever, ever listen to

852
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,800
Speaker 2:  SiriusXM as long as I live. I refuse.

853
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,680
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, but I'm commuting from the woods to the city once a week. So

854
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,600
Speaker 4:  I spend five hours in a single day in the car often. And it's

855
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,040
Speaker 4:  like, great. But like why, like honestly for the purpose of this draft, that's

856
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,160
Speaker 4:  very utilitarian, like we're making entertainment here and it's, it's VIP

857
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:03,720
Speaker 4:  and Flex Server,

858
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,360
Speaker 2:  Which I'm assuming is Free Vipin doesn't charge you server fees.

859
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:11,400
Speaker 4:  We again, we're friends for a long time. It, it all evens out in the end.

860
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,880
Speaker 4:  All right. I've bought him a lot of drinks over the years.

861
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,800
Speaker 2:  We're, we're putting a zero next to vi's Flex server. We'll put,

862
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,160
Speaker 2:  we'll put 99 cents cuz you have to buy 'em a beer every once in a while.

863
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,000
Speaker 2:  Cost 99 cents a month. All right. All right. Last pick. Alex,

864
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:24,960
Speaker 2:  what do you got?

865
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,680
Speaker 5:  What's the, what's the Apple service thing? That's the Apple Music and the

866
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,200
Speaker 5:  Apple tv.

867
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,120
Speaker 4:  Apple one. Apple one.

868
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:31,360
Speaker 2:  Apple

869
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,080
Speaker 4:  One. Oh, that's good.

870
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,920
Speaker 2:  That's a good pick.

871
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,360
Speaker 5:  Gonna spend a bunch of money and do that one because I too

872
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:40,240
Speaker 5:  like Apple Music more than Spotify and Apple Music,

873
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,800
Speaker 5:  classical. I've actually been using that way more than I thought I would.

874
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,520
Speaker 5:  And then I think Apple TV's like it's got good content.

875
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,440
Speaker 2:  What do you watch? What are your shows really

876
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,600
Speaker 5:  Into Dickinson. I loved that when it came on Severance for all

877
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,320
Speaker 5:  Mankind. The Morning show. I don't watch the morning show.

878
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,120
Speaker 5:  That's a lie. But it's there. Ted Lasso.

879
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,280
Speaker 4:  I haven't watched the season of Ted Lasso. I think that says a lot. It's,

880
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,760
Speaker 4:  it has even occurred to me to spend time doing it. Yeah,

881
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,320
Speaker 2:  It's fine. It's a, it's a show. You know what is good is Hello? Tomorrow?

882
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:10,720
Speaker 5:  Is it actually good?

883
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,120
Speaker 2:  Weird but delightful. I've only watched like four episodes, but it's very

884
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,320
Speaker 2:  good shrinking also very good. This is the thing about Apple TV plus it doesn't

885
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,200
Speaker 2:  have that much stuff, but it's like good show to bad show ratio

886
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,200
Speaker 2:  is probably higher than any other platform I can think

887
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,840
Speaker 5:  Of. Like Dickinson is a show. I will, I will rewatch. It's one of my rewatch

888
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,520
Speaker 5:  shows at this point. I just, I love it. And then for all

889
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,240
Speaker 5:  mankind, like it's great you watch people get progressively worse makeup

890
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,800
Speaker 5:  as they pretend to age 10 years every season and then go into space with

891
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,600
Speaker 5:  iPods. That's

892
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,560
Speaker 2:  Ra. Alex, that was a really good pick. I'm sort of annoyed because you also,

893
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,280
Speaker 2:  for Apple One, you get Apple Arcade and you get a bunch of iCloud storage

894
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,200
Speaker 2:  that you'll never use. But that's a, that's a pretty good pick. If

895
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,040
Speaker 4:  I, if iCloud storage isn't, then Alex is finally with the last pick,

896
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,160
Speaker 4:  snaked the most important pick in the draft.

897
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You guys are all gonna be getting that obnoxious iCloud

898
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,520
Speaker 5:  notification now.

899
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:06,200
Speaker 4:  I don't think iCloud storage accounts, like if not, we need to redo this

900
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,520
Speaker 4:  whole pick.

901
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,080
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna take Dropbox Business. It's my last pick.

902
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,840
Speaker 2:  Okay, so what's

903
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,320
Speaker 5:  Your final

904
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,200
Speaker 2:  One? I have two left on my list, which serve very different purposes for

905
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,920
Speaker 2:  me. One is Amazon Prime video, which was what I was gonna pick if I didn't

906
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,160
Speaker 2:  get YouTube because it's another one that's just like a big bunch of content

907
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:26,520
Speaker 2:  plus of music service for free. So that was exciting. And then there's

908
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,400
Speaker 2:  Hulu with live tv, which I want to pick because I

909
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,080
Speaker 2:  like Hulu because it also has a couple of my like endlessly rewatched

910
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,920
Speaker 2:  shows. And because I need live sports, I think I'm gonna pick

911
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,640
Speaker 2:  Hulu. I think Hulu with live tv, which is 70 bucks a month. It comes

912
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,760
Speaker 2:  with, well, okay, here's a rules clarification question. If I sign up for

913
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,560
Speaker 2:  Hulu with live tv, I also get the Disney bundle. I like back into the Disney

914
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,840
Speaker 2:  bundle. Does that count?

915
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:53,000
Speaker 4:  Wait There's no way to get Hulu with live TV without getting Disney Plus.

916
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,720
Speaker 2:  No, you just get it for free. It's 70 bucks a month. Like they're just, they're

917
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,760
Speaker 2:  like, sure, I have Disney you

918
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,680
Speaker 5:  Some, some

919
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,960
Speaker 4:  Money. Yeah, I mean, I think this is allowed. Okay, good. I, I came at Hulu

920
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,800
Speaker 4:  the other way, but if I hadn't blown the salary cap with Sunday ticket,

921
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,840
Speaker 4:  we, we would be competing here and I think it would be fair.

922
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:11,800
Speaker 2:  Okay. All right. Good. I buy it then. Yeah. I'm taking Hulu IV 70

923
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,640
Speaker 2:  bucks a month. I get Disney plus I get ESPN plus I get New Girl, which is

924
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,440
Speaker 2:  just about to leave Netflix and go to Hulu, which is another one of the shows

925
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,280
Speaker 2:  I've watched 700 times. Shit's Creek is there. It's another one I've

926
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,280
Speaker 4:  Watched. Oh my God. This is an incredible sleeper final pick.

927
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:25,840
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah. I feel really good about this,

928
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,520
Speaker 5:  But like Neil and I both have access to that. He can just hit up his buddy.

929
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,560
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Can I just get Zins, my last pick is Neely giving me Zins number.

930
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:35,880
Speaker 4:  That's my,

931
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,240
Speaker 2:  That's my final pick.

932
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,160
Speaker 4:  All that's on there is Linux. You guys

933
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,800
Speaker 5:  Just love that Red hat. Yeah.

934
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:46,400
Speaker 2:  I really like, I did not mean to do this. I accidentally ended up with like

935
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,080
Speaker 2:  the most down the middle set of streaming

936
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,600
Speaker 2:  services. This is really upsetting. Alright, so we have done five picks.

937
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,440
Speaker 2:  Congratulations to everybody. We completed the draft. Andrew, do you have

938
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,400
Speaker 2:  a cool last sound for the end of the draft?

939
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:09,680
Speaker 2:  Andrew, you've been keeping track of everything, all the math, all the money

940
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,320
Speaker 2:  totaled up for us. How are we doing?

941
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,960
Speaker 6:  Okay, so Eli, despite picking two streaming services that

942
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,320
Speaker 6:  did not cost any money collectively,

943
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,400
Speaker 6:  1 0 4 98

944
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:21,000
Speaker 5:  A

945
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,680
Speaker 6:  Month plus the 2 89, right? For the Sunday

946
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,080
Speaker 6:  ticket, which would be 3 93 96.

947
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,920
Speaker 6:  One time payment of that 2 89, but still Alex,

948
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:36,160
Speaker 6:  it's lowest here at 63 92. Good work.

949
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,880
Speaker 6:  Frugal. David, you really added it up with Hulu at live

950
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,040
Speaker 6:  TV coming at 1 29 95. Whoa.

951
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,880
Speaker 4:  Oof. A month. I got, I got football and a kind

952
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,720
Speaker 4:  of cheaper monthly

953
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:53,600
Speaker 2:  Picking. Netflix was a mistake. Now that I'm looking at it, 20 bucks for

954
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,320
Speaker 2:  Netflix was a bad use of 20 bucks a month.

955
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,920
Speaker 6:  YouTube premium family is a lot of money.

956
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:02,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But, but the reason, okay, let me defend family real fast.

957
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:06,800
Speaker 2:  I don't have to watch ads. Even when Anna wants to watch YouTube,

958
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:07,400
Speaker 2:  which

959
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,560
Speaker 4:  Is worth the extra money. That's true. That's true.

960
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,760
Speaker 2:  But okay, so that means Alex, you get, you get the free pick here at the

961
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,400
Speaker 2:  end. Ooh. Anything you want sky's the limit.

962
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:19,440
Speaker 5:  Okay. Does this one count Libro fm?

963
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,480
Speaker 4:  Oh my god. Alex, I gotta read my books. So it's an audiobook service.

964
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,080
Speaker 2:  Doesn't count.

965
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,480
Speaker 5:  Doesn't count. Okay. I

966
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,480
Speaker 2:  Don't know why. It just, it just doesn't, I just like, no,

967
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,120
Speaker 4:  I can't do it. That's an audiobook streaming service or is that just like

968
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:31,600
Speaker 4:  a, like a

969
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,360
Speaker 5:  Book? It's an audiobook service. And you get like a credit to buy a book

970
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,080
Speaker 5:  each month? No. Okay. All right, cool. Well that's great. I, I still,

971
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:43,120
Speaker 5:  I still can read books on my own time and you didn't make sure

972
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,560
Speaker 5:  I was gonna be allowed to read books. What's the Microsoft,

973
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,920
Speaker 5:  the Microsoft streaming cloud thing for games. Oh,

974
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,080
Speaker 2:  That's interesting.

975
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:54,840
Speaker 5:  I like, I think of it as Microsoft X Cloud, but whatever it's actually called

976
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,640
Speaker 5:  now, that one,

977
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:59,000
Speaker 2:  I just call it Game Pass. I think it has a more complicated name, but everybody

978
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,040
Speaker 2:  just calls it Game Pass. Yeah,

979
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,560
Speaker 5:  That's a good, that's also a good way to put it. Yeah. Game Pass.

980
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:05,920
Speaker 4:  So you ended up with the two game services with Apple One. You got Apple

981
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,080
Speaker 4:  or K and I are, you're going with Game Pass. Yeah.

982
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,240
Speaker 5:  And then I play the other games while I'm watching my Criterion.

983
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:14,280
Speaker 4:  Really good. Wild Card pick at the end. Man,

984
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,880
Speaker 2:  That is a really good pick. Huh?

985
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,040
Speaker 5:  This is either that or Plex, but I already did Channels, which gives me the

986
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,880
Speaker 5:  same benefit as Plex, but a better DVR layout. Yeah.

987
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,280
Speaker 5:  Stuff still sometimes adds to it when I don't DVR it. It's wild. It's

988
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,060
Speaker 4:  Crazy. Does it, this means that Amazon Prime went completely unpicked.

989
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:33,060
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Which I, I think is not totally surprising.

990
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,300
Speaker 5:  How often are you like, oh man, I just really gotta watch like

991
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:41,660
Speaker 5:  extraction, but even more boring and on a worse UI

992
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:45,460
Speaker 4:  Again, because Becky is so into comedy every now and again,

993
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,700
Speaker 4:  there's like one comedy special on Amazon Prime. Yeah, I think that's it.

994
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,980
Speaker 2:  I'm really angry at this pick Alex, that was a really good pick that I feel

995
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,900
Speaker 2:  like I, if I had thought of that I probably would've picked a while ago.

996
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,940
Speaker 2:  Game Pass is good and also like a strong future bet. Like if we come

997
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,180
Speaker 2:  back in, the question is like, how did all our bets do? Yeah.

998
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:04,660
Speaker 5:  Game Game Pass is gonna exist. Yeah. Like the majority of mine will still

999
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,860
Speaker 5:  be around except for probably my first two. Maybe

1000
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:11,460
Speaker 4:  I feel great about my draft. This is a gonna be, it's a, this is a solid

1001
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,020
Speaker 4:  year ahead

1002
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:15,980
Speaker 2:  On my list. The only things that went unpicked that I still have on my list

1003
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,900
Speaker 2:  are nobody picked Prime Video. Nobody picked Spotify, which is

1004
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:23,580
Speaker 2:  very interesting. We're all happy with our other weird services or

1005
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,540
Speaker 2:  free Pandora and, and then I have a bunch of, like,

1006
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:31,300
Speaker 2:  I wrote down, you know, Freek and Tubi and Pluto TV and the Roku channel

1007
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:35,220
Speaker 2:  and all that stuff and Sling and nobody picked any of that. I'm not super

1008
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:35,660
Speaker 2:  shocked.

1009
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:39,540
Speaker 5:  But see I get, I get the Roku channel because it does an M three U

1010
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,540
Speaker 5:  playlist so I can watch it anytime on channels. Yeah.

1011
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,540
Speaker 4:  Here's what I'm saying. I, if this drafted had like two or three more people

1012
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:50,140
Speaker 4:  in it, I think the drafting around those channels would've been

1013
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:54,100
Speaker 4:  intense, especially cuz then they would've been how you would strategically

1014
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,940
Speaker 4:  have lowered the cost to try to get that extra pick.

1015
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,020
Speaker 2:  All right, well next year, we'll this draft will include 13 people.

1016
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,540
Speaker 2:  We're gonna have a 32 team draft next year and everybody gets

1017
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,220
Speaker 2:  five picks. It's gonna get outrageous.

1018
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,340
Speaker 4:  Although I will say even in this draft, David, I felt as though I was stealing

1019
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,940
Speaker 4:  picture from you and I don't think I did that really, except maybe for Sunday

1020
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,540
Speaker 4:  ticket. Neither of us was competing with Alex. No,

1021
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:17,580
Speaker 5:  No one

1022
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,860
Speaker 4:  Was really competing. Alex is fully trust the process. Like whatever was

1023
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:21,820
Speaker 4:  going on over there.

1024
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,660
Speaker 2:  I will say I was hoping that my three and four picks were gonna be YouTube

1025
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,900
Speaker 2:  and TikTok. That was gonna be the turn I made at three and four. I thought

1026
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,100
Speaker 2:  one of you would take hbo, one of you would take Disney, and then I would

1027
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,780
Speaker 2:  get YouTube and TikTok and just like laugh at you old people about how I

1028
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,900
Speaker 2:  understand the future. And it didn't really work out that way.

1029
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,860
Speaker 4:  Unfortunately. No one took Instagram reels.

1030
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,460
Speaker 2:  Well, you took TikTok, so you basically took Instagram reels.

1031
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:46,500
Speaker 4:  It's brutal. But if you want, if you wanted that thing Instagram, right?

1032
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,980
Speaker 4:  You want Diet TikTok, you take Instagram

1033
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,660
Speaker 2:  Reels. True.

1034
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:53,700
Speaker 5:  I like that. I'm not gonna know anything about the real world ever with

1035
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,100
Speaker 5:  my picks. I don't know what's

1036
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,380
Speaker 2:  Happening in world, which is not that different from what you came into this

1037
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,460
Speaker 2:  with. So you're, you're good there.

1038
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:02,980
Speaker 5:  I, I've learned nothing about the draft in this whole process and I'm not

1039
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,100
Speaker 5:  going to with my picks.

1040
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,780
Speaker 2:  All right. We should go. We're gonna do this again next year and we're gonna

1041
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,300
Speaker 2:  have to come up with some score by which we see how we did this year.

1042
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:16,500
Speaker 2:  Also, today as this show goes live, there's an event at which

1043
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,260
Speaker 2:  HBO Max and Discovery Plus may cease to be what they

1044
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,940
Speaker 2:  currently are. So this might all get real weird real fast, but we'll have

1045
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,860
Speaker 2:  lot more to talk about. Thank you both for doing this. This is very fun.
