19
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,610
Speaker 4:  Hi, how are you?

20
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,010
Speaker 3:  I'm doing good. I'm a little hungry. It's getting around lunchtime here.

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,170
Speaker 4:  Oh, I have the perfect interview for you. It's gonna make you extra hungry.

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,290
Speaker 3:  Yes, because last week you talked Toka pop from Hive Social. Who do you have

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:14,890
Speaker 3:  for me this week?

24
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,170
Speaker 4:  Yes, I, I'm very excited today to have the creator

25
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,410
Speaker 4:  of the M Rib Locator, Alan Klein. Ooh.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,530
Speaker 4:  This is a website where users can track how they

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,530
Speaker 4:  can find a McDonald's McRib sandwich.

28
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,890
Speaker 5:  The mc McRib is back on the new taste menu at McDonald's, but only for a

29
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,850
Speaker 5:  while. So hurry in for that. One-of-a-kind super saucy piled on a Homestyle

30
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,370
Speaker 5:  roll taste. Have

31
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,010
Speaker 4:  You Miss Alan might actually be the biggest Mick McRib fan

32
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,850
Speaker 4:  on the planet. Okay. And we are gonna talk about why he spent

33
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,650
Speaker 4:  so much of his free time making this website, what he does with all of the

34
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,850
Speaker 4:  Mick Rib location data, which is very interesting and the future of his

35
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,610
Speaker 4:  work since the Mick Rib went on a farewell tour last year.

36
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,010
Speaker 3:  All right, well I know I'm gonna be absolutely starved by the end of this,

37
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,810
Speaker 3:  so let's go ahead and get to it.

38
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,250
Speaker 4:  Hi Alan.

39
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,090
Speaker 6:  Hi Ashley. Thanks for having me today.

40
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,130
Speaker 4:  Oh man. I cannot wait to talk to you about Mick Rib

41
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,050
Speaker 4:  Locator. So I have given a very broad description of

42
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,570
Speaker 4:  the site, but Alan, do you mind explaining to our

43
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,650
Speaker 4:  listeners in more detail about M McRib locator and how it

44
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:26,890
Speaker 4:  works?

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,570
Speaker 6:  Yeah, sure. So the Mc McRib locator webpage, it's, it's really a

46
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,290
Speaker 6:  crowdsource driven page where people from across the world, it's not just

47
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,290
Speaker 6:  the United States, have the M McRib, they can come and contribute to the

48
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,050
Speaker 6:  page saying, I found a McRib at a given location. And then, and as a addition

49
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,650
Speaker 6:  to that, fans can come in and say, yes, I agree there was one there. Or I

50
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,570
Speaker 6:  can dispute that finding cuz sometimes, you know, we get some that are a

51
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,010
Speaker 6:  little bit overexcited fans that may be a little bit too soon. So we, we

52
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,850
Speaker 6:  build up this base of places on a map so people can see where can I find

53
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,330
Speaker 6:  the nearest McRib because we never know when they're going to be around or

54
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,760
Speaker 6:  how far we have to, to go to find them.

55
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,360
Speaker 4:  That's so intriguing that it's all user-generated data. This

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,240
Speaker 4:  reminds me a lot of Gawker stalker or that old

57
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,160
Speaker 4:  website for finding iPhones when it right be before we could really kind

58
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,040
Speaker 4:  of order them online. Do you remember when you ate your first McRib?

59
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,680
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I do. It, it's, it's a memory from back way in my youth.

60
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,600
Speaker 6:  I grew up on a family farm in South Dakota and, and we would, we raised hogs

61
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,640
Speaker 6:  and we took 'em to town one day to market. And I remember with my dad, right

62
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,360
Speaker 6:  after taking 'em to the, to the marketplace, we went over to the local McDonald's

63
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,680
Speaker 6:  in town and they happened to have the M McRib on the menu. And I remember

64
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,320
Speaker 6:  eating the McRib, not necessarily so much for the McRib itself, but having

65
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,280
Speaker 6:  a kind of surreal moment as a child realizing like, we just took hogs

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,680
Speaker 6:  to market and now here we are eating, you know, the byproduct of all of our

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,200
Speaker 6:  efforts. And it's, it's not just feeding ourselves, it's like feeding, you

68
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,760
Speaker 6:  know, essentially the entire world.

69
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,840
Speaker 4:  That's so fascinating that you, that was your first

70
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,200
Speaker 4:  Mick McRib experience. That is very surreal.

71
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,440
Speaker 6:  It really is. Cuz you do all that work, you know, you do all the work on

72
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,880
Speaker 6:  a farm and you, you know, it goes somewhere. But when you finally have that

73
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,000
Speaker 6:  realization like, holy smokes, like I've, I'm doing something much larger

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,040
Speaker 6:  than just something here locally.

75
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,320
Speaker 4:  I would imagine it would also be so interesting to have had the

76
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,040
Speaker 4:  experience of growing up on a farm, raising hogs. You have a

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,520
Speaker 4:  very different idea of what pork should taste like

78
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,840
Speaker 4:  as opposed to the very processed version of what

79
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,760
Speaker 4:  a Mick rib is that's made, I mean they make it with a mold so, right.

80
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,000
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The, the Mick McRib itself, right. It comes from, it's a pork shoulder

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,720
Speaker 6:  is what they've said in the past and they, they process it down and like

82
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,200
Speaker 6:  you said, they put it through a mold processes to get it down to that rib

83
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,040
Speaker 6:  like shape that they, they distribute. Yeah, it's definitely the pork itself

84
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,560
Speaker 6:  when you have it as a different, you know, if you go get a pork chop or a

85
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,640
Speaker 6:  pork loin, it's a little bit different, right. Cuz it's not that processed

86
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,280
Speaker 6:  part. But it's still like the McRib itself still produces that, that feeling

87
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,200
Speaker 6:  of, you know, the, the taste of the pork itself.

88
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,480
Speaker 4:  So what is it about the mc McRib that sparks joy for you? So much joy

89
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,800
Speaker 4:  that you made a website about it?

90
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,560
Speaker 6:  You know what it's always been from, even when the origins of the micro

91
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,360
Speaker 6:  locator itself, it was like helping other people isn't that it's no longer

92
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,880
Speaker 6:  just the sandwich itself For me that keeps it going. It's, you know, I'm

93
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,800
Speaker 6:  helping a larger community. It's fellow fans like myself and

94
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,560
Speaker 6:  that really is what keeps me driven to keep doing it because the

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,160
Speaker 6:  sandwich itself I've always enjoyed, right? It's a, it's a barbecue pork

96
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,080
Speaker 6:  sandwich. You don't really have a comparable thing on the market

97
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,880
Speaker 6:  in the fast food industry. You know, there's been a few other efforts of

98
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,600
Speaker 6:  people trying to produce something very similar, but for a long time if you

99
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,160
Speaker 6:  wanted a pork product, you know that you're looking at the McRib, when's

100
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,000
Speaker 6:  it coming? And there's that alert because for a long time it

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,920
Speaker 6:  was an offering that was stored by store decisions. So you would go in a

102
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,520
Speaker 6:  region like where I'm at now in Minnesota, we wouldn't have the McRib for

103
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,240
Speaker 6:  a very long time and suddenly, oh look it's back and you get those memories.

104
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,560
Speaker 6:  For me it's some of those memories again of my youth. But for a lot of people,

105
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,760
Speaker 6:  like it's just something you can't get somewhere else at barbecue sandwich

106
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,880
Speaker 6:  in a pork sandwich in a fast food venue.

107
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,080
Speaker 4:  So when did you realize there needed to to be a tool for finding the Mick

108
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,920
Speaker 4:  McRib? When did you decide to build the site? How long did it take?

109
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,640
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so back, you know, a number of years ago around that 2008,

110
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,560
Speaker 6:  2009 era, I was working in meteorology at the time. I have a meteorology

111
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,320
Speaker 6:  degree so let's where my, my story starts for for professionally.

112
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,240
Speaker 6:  And I was looking to make a product that was something to help find storm

113
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,760
Speaker 6:  chasers. Cause it really wasn't something at the time really to help coordinate

114
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,200
Speaker 6:  your chasing. And it's more of where are my friends at where you're at in

115
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,760
Speaker 6:  the storm, those types of things. And I was working on it and working on

116
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,600
Speaker 6:  it and while I was at work one day the McRib was back somewhere nearby

117
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,680
Speaker 6:  and it turned out there were a few other Avid fans at my workplace and we

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,560
Speaker 6:  talked about how, boy it's been a really long time since I've been able to

119
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,200
Speaker 6:  get one. And it's always such a pain to find it. So this idea sparked of,

120
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,120
Speaker 6:  well instead of a storm locator, why couldn't it just be a Mick rip locator?

121
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,120
Speaker 6:  And it kind of took off from there. Like I started putting the pieces together

122
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,960
Speaker 6:  after work, you know, kind of my free time, something fun learning and kept

123
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,840
Speaker 6:  evolving it. And you know, I don't remember exactly how long it took. There's

124
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,200
Speaker 6:  a period of time where you have a product that's available as a webpage and

125
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,920
Speaker 6:  then there's the how long does it take before people start using it. Hmm.

126
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,360
Speaker 6:  And I don't know if it was months or I don't, you know, I don't really exactly

127
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,440
Speaker 6:  remember the timeframe anymore, but I know it existed for some period of

128
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,560
Speaker 6:  time before it really started to get its publicity out there.

129
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I would imagine the Mick McRib came back kind of nationwide in

130
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,600
Speaker 4:  2012, is that right? Like right, yeah. Around that timeframe. So I would

131
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,280
Speaker 4:  imagine it was probably around then when people were really clamoring to

132
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,240
Speaker 4:  find their mick ribs. I can't believe the Mick rib locator was originally

133
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,720
Speaker 4:  a tornado locator. Right. Pretty wild. Yeah.

134
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,040
Speaker 6:  And in know there was sort of those struggles of, as a storm chaser, you

135
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,880
Speaker 6:  wouldn't be able to get that accurate precision of location and

136
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,800
Speaker 6:  you remembering back to 2008 and nine, our phones weren't always the best

137
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,560
Speaker 6:  at producing that geolocation data in a right, in a friendly format back

138
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,160
Speaker 6:  to webpages. So that's sort of what helped me pivot cuz a McDonald's location

139
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,720
Speaker 6:  is static, right? It's not moving. So you're not so worried about how do

140
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,640
Speaker 6:  I keep real time? It's just these are the places and that that also helped,

141
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,360
Speaker 6:  you know, make my solution a little easier because I could see like,

142
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,560
Speaker 6:  okay, it's just a location now not trying to find a floating location.

143
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,720
Speaker 4:  Right. It's a, it's fixed for the most

144
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,560
Speaker 6:  Part. Yeah, exactly. It's, it's fixed.

145
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,320
Speaker 4:  And so over the course of all of these years

146
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,040
Speaker 4:  you've I'm sure amassed some great deal of data

147
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,200
Speaker 4:  on people who are reporting M McRibs is looking for M ribs, right?

148
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,920
Speaker 4:  What do you do with that data? Does McDonald's call you up? Do they say,

149
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,320
Speaker 4:  Hey, we're just doing some market research on the M McRib and

150
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,760
Speaker 4:  you're it? Can we take a peek at your books?

151
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's a great question. And honestly the data itself, I keep it

152
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,680
Speaker 6:  internal, you're right, that would be a valid exercise of that data. But

153
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,080
Speaker 6:  that's never really been my application of it. It's more where are people

154
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,000
Speaker 6:  reporting them at, you know, where are the fan base at. So I can try to help

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,880
Speaker 6:  maybe guide some of my traffic that direction. Like I can see, hey, it comes

156
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,560
Speaker 6:  back in this part of the country first, or you know, a couple years back

157
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,000
Speaker 6:  I produced a map of, here are the states that are most likely to have a McRib

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,560
Speaker 6:  back if it's not a nationwide release because that's sort of the data I'm

159
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,120
Speaker 6:  collecting, right? It's like these are the reports. So yes, certainly there's

160
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,480
Speaker 6:  more locations than what I have on my map because it's crowdsourced, but

161
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,360
Speaker 6:  it's still the same premise of here are the hotspots for fans reporting the

162
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,320
Speaker 6:  McRib. So I kind of have an idea of if I wanna find one year to

163
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,240
Speaker 6:  year, these are the most likely places. So, so mostly the data has

164
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,040
Speaker 6:  just been internally used. Just to kind of my own curiosity, I did have someone

165
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,880
Speaker 6:  this year reach out to me kind of trying to get information of, hey,

166
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,280
Speaker 6:  in the Chicago land area, when's the McRib available? And he was trying to

167
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,360
Speaker 6:  correlate when the McRib was available to when the Chicago Bears win games

168
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,280
Speaker 6:  or not, which was kind of a fun exercise for him to do. But again,

169
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,440
Speaker 6:  it's, it's very anonymous, right? I'm not, I'm certainly not intending to

170
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,760
Speaker 6:  send any personal data out.

171
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,880
Speaker 4:  Was there anything over the years that struck you as interesting about the

172
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,760
Speaker 4:  data? Is there, is there a region that reports the most sightings?

173
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,520
Speaker 4:  Is there, do you find that there's a specific part of the country

174
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,600
Speaker 4:  or globally that just gets really jacked

175
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,320
Speaker 4:  up about the McRib coming back? Like what, what is the data that you have

176
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,880
Speaker 4:  seen that you find the most interesting?

177
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,080
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it is interesting, you know, more when we've done over the years where

178
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,400
Speaker 6:  the releases have not been nationwide, trying to see how it trickles out

179
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,000
Speaker 6:  to what regions get it first. And we definitely get a lot of traffic coming

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,960
Speaker 6:  from the southeast. We get it from the south and we do get it

181
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,600
Speaker 6:  a little bit out to the west too. But there are certainly states that are

182
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,240
Speaker 6:  voids whether it's just, there's not as many fans there, maybe they're not

183
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,520
Speaker 6:  as, you know, maybe they're not unaware of the McRib locator that's possible.

184
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,920
Speaker 6:  But there are certainly some states we don't see it much. I see tons of traffic

185
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,280
Speaker 6:  from New England states asking will it be back? Because there are part of

186
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,160
Speaker 6:  the country that very often gets skipped. They don't get the M McRib for

187
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,320
Speaker 6:  one reason or another. I remember a couple years ago, well it's been a number

188
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,080
Speaker 6:  of years ago now, New York City area, all the McDonald's store owners were

189
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,400
Speaker 6:  trying to decide should we bring the M McRib back? And one of the locators

190
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,480
Speaker 6:  stores, they really wanted it back, but the majority said, no, we,

191
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,760
Speaker 6:  we don't think we wanna offer it this year. So that owner actually went on

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,800
Speaker 6:  Twitter and was like, Hey everybody, I really tried for you. But it, it just

193
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,720
Speaker 6:  didn't work out. So we, we see a huge draw to areas that don't get it because

194
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,400
Speaker 6:  they wanna have it again. So the last couple years having it

195
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,480
Speaker 6:  nationwide has been, you know, it's been really nice for all the fans that

196
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,880
Speaker 6:  are out there.

197
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,200
Speaker 4:  So right now, currently, we should elaborate on this for

198
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,160
Speaker 4:  people who are maybe less Mick aware of the Mick

199
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,800
Speaker 4:  McRib status. So the, the Mick McRib currently is retired,

200
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,080
Speaker 4:  they had a farewell tour last fall.

201
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,280
Speaker 6:  That's what they say, right? We've done this before. Like this isn't new

202
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,840
Speaker 6:  for Mick Rib fans. That's, that's sort of part of the alert for some, right?

203
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,520
Speaker 6:  Like will it be back or won't it be back thus far? We see,

204
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,360
Speaker 6:  you know, every year McDonald's reports how much revenues they've had in

205
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,040
Speaker 6:  the quarters and we've seen whenever the McRib has been back, those quarters

206
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,800
Speaker 6:  seem to do better for them. So it's an interesting idea of, well it's retired

207
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,080
Speaker 6:  in the United States because keep in mind in Germany you can always get the

208
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,960
Speaker 6:  McRib. It's there year round, it's always available and it does pop up in,

209
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,560
Speaker 6:  in other parts of the world from time to time. We had Malta this year, I

210
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,960
Speaker 6:  hadn't seen them for a long time or Australia even. There's people down there

211
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,760
Speaker 6:  that get it or Japan, it floats around where it comes. And oftentimes those

212
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,280
Speaker 6:  international options are maybe a little bit different spin on the McRib,

213
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,680
Speaker 6:  but it's still the McRib, they still advertise it that way. Central America

214
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Speaker 6:  gets them every year now too, where they have these little variations on

215
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,160
Speaker 6:  them that are kind of fun. But yeah, I mean the fans come, they come in from

216
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,080
Speaker 6:  most places cuz they all want to participate and help each other, which is

217
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,560
Speaker 6:  really what I like about the webpage.

218
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,640
Speaker 4:  Okay, we're gonna take a quick break, but when I come back I'll chat with

219
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,200
Speaker 4:  Alex Kranz about McDonald's making their own version of the McRib

220
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,520
Speaker 4:  locator and how Allen felt about that.

221
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,020
Speaker 1:  This episode is sponsored by Toyota Crown Crown's available hybrid

223

228
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,560
Speaker 4:  Okay, we're back. And Alex Kranz is here. Hi Alex.

229
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,560
Speaker 3:  Hello. You guys have made me absolutely starving.

230
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,520
Speaker 4:  Good. I could not have imagined that there was a whole underbelly,

231
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,760
Speaker 4:  a pork underbelly, if you will. There's just a whole underbelly

232
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,640
Speaker 4:  world of finding a m McRib, like the M McRib has such a, has such a fan

233
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:34,840
Speaker 4:  base.

234
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,920
Speaker 3:  Yeah, and I remember like used to it was, it was temporary. And so when he

235
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,720
Speaker 3:  started this in 2009, it was like a limited offer and

236
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,280
Speaker 3:  kinda like the Shamrock Shake. And then in 2016

237
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,880
Speaker 3:  McDonald's had their own like app called the Mick McRib finder, which

238
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,040
Speaker 3:  kind of felt like a clone.

239
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,560
Speaker 7:  Well Friends, the Cult classic is back at McDonald's,

240
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,720
Speaker 7:  the McRib, if you wanna make sure where you can find it, they actually have

241
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,640
Speaker 7:  a M McRib locator app. So you go into your app store and you

242
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,360
Speaker 7:  can download this app and it's a M McRib finder, but

243
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,280
Speaker 4:  They absolutely must have known about Alan's page and then

244
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,760
Speaker 4:  just, you know, just, just Facebooked it just Facebooked it for themselves

245
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,440
Speaker 4:  as I, as I like to call it. Yeah, it was a very, obviously a very

246
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,360
Speaker 4:  influential website for Mick McRib lovers everywhere. Yeah. And clearly

247
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,320
Speaker 4:  a very good idea. So they launched the Mick McRib finder not locator.

248
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,920
Speaker 4:  Fun fact about that. It's not around anymore. So Alan's own Mick

249
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,240
Speaker 4:  McRib locator completely outlasted McDonald's official offering.

250
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:34,920
Speaker 4:  Oh

251
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,720
Speaker 3:  My God, I love that. So how does, how does Alan actually feel about

252
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,680
Speaker 3:  McDonald's kind of aping his work?

253
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,040
Speaker 4:  Well, I asked him about that, so let's hear,

254
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,920
Speaker 6:  I remember it coming out and going, well wow, they're doing something just

255
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,640
Speaker 6:  like I'm doing. But you know, the, the main difference always was is mine

256
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,440
Speaker 6:  was crowdsourced. So the McDonald's webpage at the start OFM McRib season,

257
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,400
Speaker 6:  they don't always show the availability that's truly in store because they're

258
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,200
Speaker 6:  showing what's available for their consumers and their app, or that's what

259
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,640
Speaker 6:  it is nowadays. That's what's available on the app. And those early days,

260
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,720
Speaker 6:  they don't show the m McRib is available. We, I remember this year someone

261
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,400
Speaker 6:  said they went like two or three weeks before it actually became available

262
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,280
Speaker 6:  on the register in store. They could still order it, but that was being

263
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,880
Speaker 6:  rung up as a different product. And it certainly is certainly more interesting

264
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,440
Speaker 6:  toward the end of the season too, is are they still there? And certainly

265
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,880
Speaker 6:  the McDonald's app today at least their mobile ordering app is certainly

266
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,160
Speaker 6:  more accustomed to catching that toward the end. But that initial upfront

267
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,800
Speaker 6:  is where my webpage continues to provide value for Mick McRib fans because

268
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,560
Speaker 6:  it's, it's not there on the menu, but we know it's there.

269
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,280
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean the, the reflection of live reporting

270
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,080
Speaker 4:  is certainly a much more powerful tool for anybody actually

271
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,760
Speaker 4:  seeking a Mick rib. So you're, you're gonna keep going, you're gonna

272
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,080
Speaker 4:  keep the site up, you're gonna keep it running. Do you consider yourself

273
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,720
Speaker 4:  a Mick influencer? Are you, like is this a thing that you've, that has gone

274
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,800
Speaker 4:  a little bit beyond McRib locator or do you feel like it's pretty contained

275
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,680
Speaker 4:  to just like running this website and specifically supporting people

276
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,520
Speaker 4:  who would like to enjoy a mc McRib?

277
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,240
Speaker 6:  Yeah, there've been, people reach out in the past asking for other products

278
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,600
Speaker 6:  perhaps that we would, we would try to pursue. And I did do another one where

279
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,000
Speaker 6:  for the, the Shamrock Shake, right, the Shamrock Shake used to be one that

280
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,560
Speaker 6:  wasn't always a perennial this time of year. So I had another idea why I

281
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,000
Speaker 6:  did the Shake Locator, but it wasn't as popular because again, it was a product

282
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,520
Speaker 6:  that became more consistently available and it still lives,

283
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,720
Speaker 6:  it just isn't used all that much because fans know, oh, it's coming to be,

284
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,000
Speaker 6:  you know, around St. Patrick's Day will get a shamrock shake nowadays. But

285
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,600
Speaker 6:  it certainly lives on, I mean, I certainly have no intention of

286
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,360
Speaker 6:  disbanding the McRib locator. And I, I don't really see myself

287
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,080
Speaker 6:  as an influencer per se. I mean, my efforts are always focused on the mcg

288
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,400
Speaker 6:  McRib and I'm certainly going to promote because it, you know, obviously

289
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,760
Speaker 6:  it helps myself get other fans onto the page, you know, hey, the mcg McRib

290
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,680
Speaker 6:  is back and I have had regional McDonald's locations contact me saying, Hey,

291
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,880
Speaker 6:  you know what, these particular stores are gonna start serving it these days.

292
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,240
Speaker 6:  You know, they want to help get the information in, but there's, it's more

293
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,000
Speaker 6:  of a mutual conversation so than an influence type position.

294
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,000
Speaker 4:  So I know that part of the website allows you to report

295
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,560
Speaker 4:  anonymously and if you do that then you're, you show up as the

296
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,360
Speaker 4:  hamburger on the map. Right. Which is delightful. It's a great detail,

297
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,440
Speaker 4:  but I, I can't make a a a mick disinformation joke here.

298
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,040
Speaker 4:  That's word doesn't sound great, it's not funny. But

299
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,800
Speaker 4:  how do you, how do you deal with moderation? How do you deal with false reports?

300
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,600
Speaker 4:  Have you ever had a situation in which you've been swarmed by people trying

301
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,080
Speaker 4:  to sort of falsely claim a Mick rib is somewhere, I know this is like the

302
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,880
Speaker 4:  smallest of problems for people, like I've come to this McDonald's

303
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,840
Speaker 4:  and the, the hamburger said there was a mc McRib beer and there isn't one.

304
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Speaker 4:  But how do you, how do you deal with that? Or, or have you ever had to deal

305
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:42,880
Speaker 4:  with that?

306
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,000
Speaker 6:  No, it's, it's a very real problem. I, I do get plenty of reports every year

307
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,440
Speaker 6:  from people for one reason or another. Another, maybe they thought they were

308
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,760
Speaker 6:  going to say I'd like to have one. Or maybe they were just being funny with

309
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,080
Speaker 6:  their friends to say, look, it's on a map that seems to be most likely the

310
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,400
Speaker 6:  case. That's where each of those reports before they're confirmed, there's

311
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,880
Speaker 6:  an option to say, I think it's here or I dispute that it's here

312
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,600
Speaker 6:  cuz that helps me hone in on the ones that are most likely a suspicious

313
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,840
Speaker 6:  reporting. Obviously like this time of year, I know most likely it's going

314
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,760
Speaker 6:  to be not real if it's in the United States, but I can still go flush out,

315
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,640
Speaker 6:  go look, do my diligence to find out is it actually there. And I remember

316
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,400
Speaker 6:  a couple years ago where one fan, you know, it's just myself

317
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,960
Speaker 6:  and my wife helps do some of the social media stuff for me it's just a two

318
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,480
Speaker 6:  of us. Keep in mind it's not, it's not like a team of McRib locator

319
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,280
Speaker 6:  staff here going through trying to track things down. So it's, you know,

320
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,400
Speaker 6:  as I get to it outside of my normal day job or whatever we have going on,

321
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,200
Speaker 6:  and I remember one particular day I got this email from someone,

322
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,560
Speaker 6:  they're like, please take this location off the map. We're getting bombarded

323
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,480
Speaker 6:  with calls. We don't have the McRib. And I apologize to them like, I'm so

324
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,880
Speaker 6:  sorry that happened. I went in and removed it immediately. Cuz obviously

325
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,800
Speaker 6:  nobody wants that experience, but it, it's a real problem. So it's, it's

326
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,560
Speaker 6:  more as best I can, I stay up with those reports to flush 'em out.

327
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,520
Speaker 6:  And then again, having the fans also help contribute to say, no that's not

328
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,680
Speaker 6:  true. That helps me focus in on those ones to start with.

329
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's, it is very interesting that you seem to

330
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,680
Speaker 4:  have kind of grassroots cultivated a very

331
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,920
Speaker 4:  transparent and willingly honest group

332
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,840
Speaker 4:  of users who, who seem very dedicated to making sure that accurate

333
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,600
Speaker 4:  information is on your website. Like I, I think that seems like a very

334
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,160
Speaker 4:  baseline expectation, but I also believe that

335
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,200
Speaker 4:  right now in 2023 it is actually maybe, maybe not a

336
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,760
Speaker 4:  baseline expectation and it is a pleasant surprise.

337
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,440
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And again it's not like you're saying the majority of the users that

338
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,400
Speaker 6:  come in, they're there for the honest reason of I'm interested in the McRib.

339
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,520
Speaker 6:  And it's not terribly hard when people put in their fake

340
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,480
Speaker 6:  reports. Oftentimes there's things about those reports that make it very

341
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,440
Speaker 6:  clear by the name or whatever it is that's in there that these aren't real

342
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,960
Speaker 6:  reports. So by and far the fans are people who

343
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,840
Speaker 6:  legit. I want to contribute back to the MCG McRib community.

344
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,640
Speaker 4:  There's something really special about weird websites right now.

345
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,080
Speaker 4:  We discussed this just a little bit when I did a soundcheck with you last

346
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,920
Speaker 4:  week. There is an era of the internet from

347
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,360
Speaker 4:  around the early aughts where you could just find

348
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,560
Speaker 4:  the strangest websites, the most niche websites

349
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,800
Speaker 4:  and they would be so delightful and bizarre

350
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,920
Speaker 4:  and serve a very specific group of people. And it feels like

351
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,320
Speaker 4:  the M McRib locator is sort of an echo of that

352
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,200
Speaker 4:  bygone era because really we don't have that as much anymore or

353
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,800
Speaker 4:  it's all shifted really to social media. You have kind of your favorite weirdo

354
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,760
Speaker 4:  niche accounts across social, wherever that may be. And I would

355
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,040
Speaker 4:  love to hear your thoughts on that. Thoughts about the Mick McRib locator

356
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,000
Speaker 4:  still being a a a traditional website number one and, and not having

357
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,600
Speaker 4:  moved to an app or something that's a little bit more

358
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,360
Speaker 4:  siloed off because you mentioned the McRib locator is a

359
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,080
Speaker 4:  global tool and there are a lot of people who do not use smartphones

360
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,960
Speaker 4:  in other markets. And so the ability to use the M McRib locator

361
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,200
Speaker 4:  seems very critical to me no matter what type of phone

362
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,160
Speaker 4:  you're using. And I, I would love to hear your thoughts on that and and just

363
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,880
Speaker 4:  in general that sort of having a website that is a little weird, a little

364
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,560
Speaker 4:  different that has echoes of that long gone era of weird

365
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,720
Speaker 4:  websites you can find.

366
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,920
Speaker 6:  Yeah it definitely does do that. It and a lot of, I think like

367
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,000
Speaker 6:  we said, those earlier years you had something you would come in for, there

368
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,440
Speaker 6:  was new content so you kept coming back or there was a particular item

369
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,320
Speaker 6:  not really all that much different from things going, you know, viral as

370
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,560
Speaker 6:  they do today. You had this thing like, hey this is really cool and you would

371
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,320
Speaker 6:  go and you'd enjoy it for a while and if there was nothing new you kind of

372
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,120
Speaker 6:  moved on. And the difference with the McRib locator was obviously the data

373
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,080
Speaker 6:  comes and goes, right? It's not, it's not just a one time, this is it type

374
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,560
Speaker 6:  of thing. And I think that's what's helped keep the interest up in it. It

375
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,040
Speaker 6:  certainly helps with a product that comes and goes off the market at

376
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,960
Speaker 6:  certainly no, no good reason. But yeah, it, it has always been very

377
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,680
Speaker 6:  interesting to see these pages that come up that go away. You know, they,

378
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,000
Speaker 6:  they do a lot of things and there's, I think part of the reason they go away

379
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,800
Speaker 6:  maybe is there's a lot of upkeep for some webpages, right? Like the more

380
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,920
Speaker 6:  and more you build into it, the more and more upkeep there is. And that was

381
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,080
Speaker 6:  sort of the same thing cuz I, I used to have an app for mobile devices that

382
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,800
Speaker 6:  I used, but it, it didn't really have the draw that the page itself did.

383
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,320
Speaker 6:  Like you said, I think because people were more, I'm willing to go to a webpage,

384
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,120
Speaker 6:  I'm a little hesitant to download an app and, and maybe even in this case

385
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,720
Speaker 6:  like this is a really strange, maybe I'll use it one time kind of thing.

386
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,800
Speaker 4:  It's an extra step that people are hesitant to do because your

387
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,600
Speaker 4:  phone has, you know, precious real estate app wise and it's like there's

388
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,120
Speaker 4:  that transaction there where you're like, oh I feel obligated to use this

389
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,360
Speaker 4:  if I'm gonna install it on my phone.

390
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,160
Speaker 6:  Right. And I certainly have had people still reach out like, Hey I really

391
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,160
Speaker 6:  miss that app. And I'm like, well you know, I, it just, there's not enough

392
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,800
Speaker 6:  time to keep it, you know, keep it modern to keep it useful. And it was an

393
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,880
Speaker 6:  okay app. I mean it certainly had things that needed improvements on, but

394
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,560
Speaker 6:  it was still more like coming back to the webpage still gave you that full

395
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,400
Speaker 6:  experience because you could still contribute by looking at the map, you

396
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,040
Speaker 6:  could still contribute by, you know, helping prove if a McRib report if you

397
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,480
Speaker 6:  thought it was true or not, if it's fake or not. And those kinds of things

398
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,920
Speaker 6:  kept people coming back and I think that's really what a lot of those other

399
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,800
Speaker 6:  pages, I mean they were great pages but they just, they didn't have something

400
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,040
Speaker 6:  to keep getting someone to come back. And that's I think why they've more

401
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,440
Speaker 6:  or less either been absorbed into somewhere else or like you said, maybe

402
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,480
Speaker 6:  they found better avenues through social media. Like this works better for

403
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,320
Speaker 6:  us to have the content come here exclusively. And and we do. Yeah, we, we

404
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,800
Speaker 6:  certainly also have the social media page is that or out there to help communicate

405
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,000
Speaker 6:  cuz that helps garner traffic from a different avenue as well. Cause it's

406
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,960
Speaker 6:  a lot easier nowadays to go out on social and say, Hey, news, news,

407
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,400
Speaker 6:  news versus before is like, well I hope you come back to my webpage when

408
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,080
Speaker 6:  there's something new. So yeah, it's a little, a little bit different transition

409
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,600
Speaker 6:  over the years.

410
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,680
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And you, you mentioned having a day job. I am

411
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,720
Speaker 4:  going to assume McRib locator is not your day job.

412
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,640
Speaker 6:  No it is not.

413
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,160
Speaker 4:  But does it make enough money to sustain itself? Is this something

414
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,200
Speaker 4:  that you just, you know, sort of pay for out of pocket? Do you have ads?

415
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,680
Speaker 4:  How do you make money or do you make money on Mick Rib

416
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,800
Speaker 4:  locator? What's the process there?

417
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so the, the early years of the Mick McRib locator, there was absolutely

418
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Speaker 6:  no ads. I was like, I don't want ads on this thing. This is, this is what

419
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,280
Speaker 6:  it is. And I had pay for it out pocket. And then over the years it's like,

420
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,640
Speaker 6:  well you know, there's, if I put a couple ads here and there, there's no

421
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,840
Speaker 6:  no reason they can be there. They'll generate enough revenue to help pay

422
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,720
Speaker 6:  for the page. And it does, there's a little bit in excess every year that

423
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,040
Speaker 6:  I put back toward other ideas. Like, you know, a number of years ago we gave

424
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,840
Speaker 6:  our make McRib locator pens or other types of merchandise that people

425
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,080
Speaker 6:  are really interested in. We, we try to find these things that we can send

426
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,520
Speaker 6:  out. We had stickers, we had, we've done various things over the years. Like

427
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,680
Speaker 6:  give something back to the fans cuz that's how you keep people interested.

428
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,520
Speaker 6:  That's sort of what we've done with it. It's certainly not something I'm

429
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,680
Speaker 6:  losing money on anymore, but it is certainly not something I'm looking to

430
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,400
Speaker 6:  make tons of money on either cuz I'm not, I'm not interested in doing that

431
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:53,920
Speaker 6:  per se.

432
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,520
Speaker 4:  You're not buying a McDonald's with

433
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,400
Speaker 6:  It. Yeah, yeah. I'm not trying to buy a McDonald's with it. I'm not, I'm

434
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,920
Speaker 6:  certainly not trying to do anything like that. I'm just, it's just keep it

435
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,720
Speaker 6:  rolling as long as we can because it's, it's one of those things, like you

436
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,240
Speaker 6:  said, you never really know when the fan base is gonna say, well

437
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,560
Speaker 6:  I've had enough.

438
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,200
Speaker 4:  Okay, we're gonna take one more break, but when we come back we're gonna

439
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,160
Speaker 4:  get really extra nerdy about the Mick Rib. So stay tuned.

Speaker 1:  let's go places.

450
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,830
Speaker 4:  All right and we're back. I've got Alex here again.

451
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,350
Speaker 3:  I'm just like, I don't know how I'm gonna survive. I gotta go get on some

452
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:10,990
Speaker 3:  Uber Eats.

453
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,150
Speaker 4:  If you're not eating a Mick McRib by the end of this interview, I'm gonna

454
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,110
Speaker 4:  be very disappointed.

455
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,150
Speaker 3:  I really, really love how passionate Alan is about this. Like he

456
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,790
Speaker 3:  really loves the Mick McRib but also like supporting the other

457
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,430
Speaker 3:  fans of the Mick McRib and it, it kind of seems like he's gonna keep doing

458
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,630
Speaker 3:  this as long as he can.

459
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,910
Speaker 4:  Yeah, you know, the mc McRib is not around right now. It went

460
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,870
Speaker 4:  on that farewell tour and you know, he's gonna keep the website up

461
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,630
Speaker 4:  because he really thinks it's gonna come back someday.

462
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,110
Speaker 4:  And it's pretty interesting in the mc McRib fan base, which

463
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,160
Speaker 4:  is such a strange term, but it exists. There are actually a couple of

464
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,800
Speaker 4:  different theories about predicting when the M McRib might

465
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,760
Speaker 4:  return. And I did a little bit of digging about this because I was very curious.

466
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,920
Speaker 4:  I really fell into a M McRib rabbit hole and it seems like a really

467
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,680
Speaker 4:  good way to predict the return or the retirement of the McRib

468
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,160
Speaker 4:  is to keep an eye on the USDA's monthly

469
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,760
Speaker 4:  cold storage report.

470
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:13,160
Speaker 4:  You're laughing because it is the best thing I've ever heard in my life.

471
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,120
Speaker 4:  And it's specifically stocks of frozen pork belly year over year.

472
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:21,200
Speaker 4:  So the report comes out and people can look at the year

473
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,960
Speaker 4:  over year stocks of frozen pork belly and if there's a surplus

474
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,920
Speaker 4:  then maybe the Mick McRib will be back and if you start seeing it fall, then

475
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,640
Speaker 4:  maybe the Mick McRib goes away. And so it's a very interesting

476
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,960
Speaker 4:  predictive, I won't say it's a tool because it's not always a hundred

477
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,520
Speaker 4:  percent accurate to the stocks. Yeah. But it is a

478
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,240
Speaker 4:  generally good indicator of when it might come back.

479
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,920
Speaker 4:  So I started wondering here if there were any plans on

480
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,520
Speaker 4:  incorporating that data into the actual Mick r locator website

481
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,320
Speaker 4:  so that people can kind of get a magic eight ball kind of, you know, outlook,

482
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,120
Speaker 4:  like not likely, you know, just sort of that that like, hey, is the Mick

483
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,800
Speaker 4:  R gonna come back soon and just immediately have a thing that says like no

484
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,240
Speaker 4:  prediction, say maybe just, maybe you're gonna have to wait for Mick Rib

485
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,560
Speaker 4:  for a while. Outlook not so good. Yeah, outlook not so good. Or like Mick

486
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,080
Speaker 4:  rib imminent, like maybe that's like a, you know, that seems really fun.

487
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,440
Speaker 4:  So I asked Alan about that.

488
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,960
Speaker 6:  Yeah, no that, that's a great avenue to follow. I've had people over the

489
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,600
Speaker 6:  years contact me to get, again, get the anonymized data to say, hey, I would

490
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,320
Speaker 6:  like to prove if this is a thing or not. And what they were always looking

491
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,040
Speaker 6:  at more directly was the, the current pricing of of hog market

492
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,960
Speaker 6:  value. Because they would say, Hey look, the values are very low so

493
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,240
Speaker 6:  McDonald's is going to buy now. And it makes sense from a very pure financial

494
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,720
Speaker 6:  perspective, why would McDonald's buy when the market's high? They should

495
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,880
Speaker 6:  always buy when it's low to maximize profits. That makes perfect sense from

496
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,520
Speaker 6:  a business perspective. It's not something that I've directly keep an eyeball

497
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,280
Speaker 6:  on because it's, it's hard to gauge certainly over the last couple

498
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,680
Speaker 6:  years the, with the way the meat markets have been fluctuating, not just

499
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,360
Speaker 6:  pork but just in general to be able to say like absolutely certain that's

500
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,840
Speaker 6:  what's going to happen. But yeah, it makes a lot of sense and it would certainly

501
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,080
Speaker 6:  be something worth tracking and it wouldn't take a whole lot of effort to

502
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,920
Speaker 6:  do that. To say, Hey, here's what we've had a number of years ago.

503
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,960
Speaker 6:  It's been quite a few where I would have someone from one of the, the meat

504
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,720
Speaker 6:  packing plants, they'd be like, Hey, secret, secret. We're starting to make

505
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,760
Speaker 6:  McRib Pat's

506
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,320
Speaker 4:  Anonymous tips. I love

507
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,600
Speaker 6:  This.

508
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,680
Speaker 4:  Yes, it is literally the secret world of the mc McRib and I I,

509
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,360
Speaker 4:  this is so interesting that you're get, you get anonymous tips from factories,

510
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:25,960
Speaker 4:  that's incredible.

511
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,840
Speaker 6:  Right? And that, and that's certainly always been again understanding

512
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,720
Speaker 6:  that the McRib is like this very, very niche thing, right? Like

513
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,520
Speaker 6:  you have people who really, really like it and you have the other people

514
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,400
Speaker 6:  who like, I don't understand why is this fan base exist? But

515
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,800
Speaker 6:  that's how anything, anything is anymore. Like with the modern era of internet,

516
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,600
Speaker 6:  you can go out and find like-minded people that are really avid about

517
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,080
Speaker 6:  something and apparently that's where they come to see my Mick Rib locator.

518
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,800
Speaker 4:  I think that brings me to kind of the pen ultimate question here,

519
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,560
Speaker 4:  which is the Mick rib as we mentioned, is made with a

520
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,480
Speaker 4:  mold. It is not a traditional actual rib, it's

521
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,320
Speaker 4:  boneless. There has been some speculation that now that the

522
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,200
Speaker 4:  Mick McRib has been retired once again and we are seeing

523
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,920
Speaker 4:  the rise of plant-based foods that we may see the

524
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,560
Speaker 4:  Mick McRib return in a completely different form, which would be a plant-based

525
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,800
Speaker 4:  Mick rib. I am curious as to your thoughts on that and if

526
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,560
Speaker 4:  it does come back as a plant-based McRib, and I'll paraphrase

527
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,280
Speaker 4:  Shakespeare here, would a m McRib by any other ingredient

528
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,600
Speaker 4:  taste as sweet?

529
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:35,640
Speaker 6:  Yeah, you know, I've, I've not really thought much about a plant-based

530
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,440
Speaker 6:  driven m McRib like product over the years. You know, I've,

531
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,920
Speaker 6:  I've seen people just in general conversations like the sauce is different,

532
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,360
Speaker 6:  it has to be different or the bread has to be different. Like there's been

533
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,680
Speaker 6:  years where people pick up on subtlety of, of changes in the, in the house

534
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,800
Speaker 6:  produced. So I would suspect that fans switching to a plant driven M rib,

535
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,800
Speaker 6:  while some people would certainly be willing to try it, which I would be

536
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,520
Speaker 6:  one, I'll try something once. I don't think it would probably garner the

537
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,240
Speaker 6:  same fan base. It's a little bit different group of people, right?

538
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,520
Speaker 6:  It's, there's nothing wrong with the plant-based driven foods, it's just

539
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Speaker 6:  that's not quite what everyone's looking for just yet. It is certainly an

540
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,240
Speaker 6:  up and coming and it's a very interesting idea to have this. Again, it's

541
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,120
Speaker 6:  a molded shape so you could certainly make a plant-based driven, McRib

542
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,760
Speaker 6:  shaped item to serve. I'm just not sure if it would have the same

543
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,640
Speaker 6:  popularity.

544
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,760
Speaker 4:  I just realized what the name of this product should be. And I shouldn't

545
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,160
Speaker 4:  laugh at my own jokes, but I mean it's right there.

546
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,280
Speaker 4:  McDonald's, you gotta name it. The mc fib.

547
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,880
Speaker 6:  Yeah the mc fib. Yes,

548
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,480
Speaker 4:  Yes. If they do that, you owe me a lot of money. McDonald's to be called

549
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,160
Speaker 4:  the mc fib. If they ever did that, let's say they

550
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,840
Speaker 4:  split it and they said we're gonna make the M McRib but we're also gonna

551
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,720
Speaker 4:  make this plant-based rim McRib, would you continue to only support

552
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,920
Speaker 4:  the authentic m McRib or would you say okay well now we have two different

553
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,280
Speaker 4:  types of m McRibs and we'll have it, you know, we'll have identifiers for

554
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,240
Speaker 4:  those at each location because maybe one in Silver Lake here

555
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,880
Speaker 4:  in Los Angeles maybe only has the plant-based McRib and not the

556
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,840
Speaker 4:  meat-based one or maybe ones in other parts of the country

557
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,200
Speaker 4:  would not carry the plant-based one and vice versa.

558
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,520
Speaker 6:  N no that, that's absolutely something that would be worth tracking and it

559
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,360
Speaker 6:  wouldn't take, again, nothing is a terrible amount of effort. So doing something

560
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,480
Speaker 6:  like that would make a lot of sense because there certainly would be the

561
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,040
Speaker 6:  fans at in a much more restricted, much more limited release of a product.

562
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:28,360
Speaker 6:  Having that availability would be very helpful because again, you can use

563
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,240
Speaker 6:  the McDonald's app in general when things have been on the market for a while

564
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,160
Speaker 6:  to find things. But it's generally trying to find you the closest store where

565
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,720
Speaker 6:  like the McRib locator, it's where's this pocket at? Because

566
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,960
Speaker 6:  honestly like if you're gonna make some sort of journey, which there have

567
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,880
Speaker 6:  been many people take very long journeys. Years ago somebody went from Colorado

568
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,760
Speaker 6:  clear down, I forget how many hours they went to go bring back a

569
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,400
Speaker 6:  big ton of, no big ton isn't quite the right phrasing, but they brought back

570
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,760
Speaker 6:  a lot of McRibs back to the Colorado market cause they hadn't had it. So

571
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,400
Speaker 6:  you don't wanna make that journey if it's not available. So being able to

572
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,680
Speaker 6:  see like there's a pocket of 'em here or a pocket of 'em there you have that

573
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,320
Speaker 6:  boost of confidence of I'll get there, it'll still be there. Now

574
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:11,240
Speaker 6:  in that same mindset, I always suggest people, even with the webpage for

575
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,960
Speaker 6:  what it is, you know, if it's getting late in the season, it's usually best

576
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Speaker 6:  to give a little buzz ahead to make sure they're still there. Because again,

577
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,680
Speaker 6:  my reports on the page, they're at that moment of time.

578
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,840
Speaker 6:  So after so many days they, you know, maybe isn't as accurate anymore.

579
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,920
Speaker 4:  I know that there has been some speculation that McDonald's will let the

580
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,960
Speaker 4:  M McRib rest this year that we may not see it back. How do you

581
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,520
Speaker 4:  recover users? How do you, how do you get the word out when the M McRibs

582
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,160
Speaker 4:  been gone for a long enough time to sort of exit the collective

583
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
Speaker 4:  awareness of it,

584
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,040
Speaker 6:  Right? And it's really about trying to find that information to

585
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,240
Speaker 6:  tell someone that it's going to come back. Cuz if you can share that like

586
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,400
Speaker 6:  through the social media avenues like it's coming back, come back to the

587
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,160
Speaker 6:  webpage, that's our best avenues. We also get pickups and

588
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,000
Speaker 6:  as the news in general picks up on Amic McRib possibility, that

589
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,160
Speaker 6:  drives people back to that curiosity of, hey, I remember that webpage I used

590
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,000
Speaker 6:  to go to. Let's go see if it's still there. Like, you know, hey maybe it's

591
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,040
Speaker 6:  still there and hey look, there's data there that I can look at to say that

592
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,280
Speaker 6:  I can go get a McRib now. And it's kind of a fun journey in that way.

593
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:16,640
Speaker 4:  What is the most amount of users, unique visitors you've had in

594
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:16,920
Speaker 4:  a day?

595
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:21,080
Speaker 6:  In a particular day? I'd have to go back and look. I mean, I can

596
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,880
Speaker 6:  tell you this, last year in October for the month of October, we had about

597
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,800
Speaker 6:  200,000 unique users on the webpage at some point during the month. Man,

598
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,160
Speaker 4:  That's a lot of Mick McRib fans.

599
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,160
Speaker 6:  It's a lot of people coming to look to see what's going on. And I, I think

600
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,880
Speaker 6:  the individual days was, you know, tens of thousands probably. Cuz again,

601
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,920
Speaker 6:  as people pick up on the news outlets that say, Hey Mick McRibs back, they

602
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,440
Speaker 6:  start searching for McRib, right? And, and search is happening and one of

603
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,640
Speaker 6:  those results is gonna be the MCG McRib locator and they're gonna go, oh

604
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,440
Speaker 6:  cool, lemme go check that out. And that's where those, you know, fans

605
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,200
Speaker 6:  helping each other really comes into play because people are very curious

606
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,920
Speaker 6:  when it's back, where can I find it?

607
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,960
Speaker 4:  I love this cycle of boom and bust, the mc McRib boom and bust cycle,

608
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,480
Speaker 4:  the bell curve of, of the Mick McRib.

609
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,720
Speaker 6:  But you're right there, there's always this constant concern like maybe it

610
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,960
Speaker 6:  won't be back this year. You know, I'm, I'm disappointed as a fan myself,

611
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,480
Speaker 6:  I'm disappointed as the operator of the webpage, but it's still like,

612
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,360
Speaker 6:  we'll see how it goes. You know, as a fan, obviously I want to be nationwide

613
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,600
Speaker 6:  every year because I want people to be able to get it wherever they can.

614
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,640
Speaker 6:  And in the same token as a, as a webpage, you know, when it's more

615
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,840
Speaker 6:  restricted I get more traffic. So it's that kind of catch of, well, which

616
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,080
Speaker 6:  one's? Right? And I've always preferred, you know, get it wherever you can.

617
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,800
Speaker 3:  Okay, thank you. That is it for the Verge cast this week. Although Ashley,

618
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,160
Speaker 3:  I gotta say mc fib

619
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:46,000
Speaker 4:  Alex, look, no one's sending me any royalties. Everyone on Earth has thought

620
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,920
Speaker 4:  of mc fib. I realized this the second the interview was over and I

621
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,640
Speaker 4:  was like, oh no, everyone's gonna just think I'm the dumbest human being

622
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:53,920
Speaker 4:  alive.

623
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,120
Speaker 3:  I mean, I don't judge you. I do a lot of puns on the show, so like anything

624
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,120
Speaker 3:  pun adjacent, I'm here for Thank you. I

625
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,960
Speaker 4:  Appreciate it. Me too. And honestly, I really hope that beyond

626
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,800
Speaker 4:  the absolutely terrible Mc fib, I hope that you all

627
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,360
Speaker 4:  out there listening learned something today, not just about the Mc McRib,

628
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,000
Speaker 4:  but also about how one person can create a useful tool for a

629
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,960
Speaker 4:  passionate community because Alan really is so passionate and it

630
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,800
Speaker 4:  is a useful tool for anybody looking for the mc McRib.

631
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,800
Speaker 3:  Well, thank you Ashley. She's gonna be back next week with another

632

Speaker 4:  Steam very recently and she is gonna talk to us about

638
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,200
Speaker 4:  making games all by yourself, which is quite a feat. All video

639
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,120
Speaker 4:  games are miracles, I've said this many times. And to do it alone

640
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,600
Speaker 4:  is pretty outstanding and she has a lot of great things to say about

641
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,600
Speaker 4:  the steam deck and indie games and a lot of other

642
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,200
Speaker 4:  things that go into making a game by yourself.
