00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,520
Speaker 1:  Welcome to the Vergecast, the flagship podcast of dynamically viral

3
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,400
Speaker 1:  videos. I'm your friend, David Pierce, and this is the second in

4
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,760
Speaker 1:  our three episode mini-series, all about the Creator

5
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,160
Speaker 1:  economy, emphasis on economy. We wanted to look into all the ways that

6
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,280
Speaker 1:  creators make money and where the money comes from and where it goes, and

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,200
Speaker 1:  how it works, and try to make sense of this whole messy

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,320
Speaker 1:  world. For this episode, we sent our producer Hadley Robinson to figure

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,280
Speaker 1:  out how creator funds work. We've heard this over and over,

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,200
Speaker 1:  over the years, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, everybody comes up with

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,160
Speaker 1:  this big pot of money and they say, here are creators have

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,120
Speaker 1:  this. Based on how your videos do, it sounds sort of simple, right? But

13
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,080
Speaker 1:  the math of who gets what and where it goes and who that

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,040
Speaker 1:  money is actually for and how you earn it is very complicated. So we

15
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,440
Speaker 1:  sent Hadley to figure out how it all works and how creators feel about it.

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,520
Speaker 1:  Here's what she came back with.

17
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,620
Speaker 3:  We are now 15 years into the whole idea of a platform paying

18
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,020
Speaker 3:  the video creators who make content on their site.

19
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,100
Speaker 3:  It all started back in 2007 when YouTube launched an ad

20
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,380
Speaker 3:  revenue sharing program to pay their stars for creating content.

21
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,300
Speaker 3:  They agreed to pay creators a majority percentage of the ad revenue made

22
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,140
Speaker 3:  from their videos. The program started with some of the most popular creators

23
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,780
Speaker 3:  of the time. People like Reto, happy Slip, and Lonely Girl,

24
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,180
Speaker 3:  15.

25
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,580
Speaker 4:  We're actually getting ready to do an experiment for you. Mintos, diet Coke,

26
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,180
Speaker 4:  you know that whole thing? Well, we've got a new twist on it.

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,180
Speaker 5:  How many times do I have to tell her? It's not Quacker. It's Quaker Oats.

28
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,020
Speaker 5:  Quaker Oats,

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,220
Speaker 6:  The Purple Monkey puppet. She doesn't like to know that she's a puppet.

30
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,020
Speaker 7:  Woohoo. We did it. Wow. Wow.

31
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,420
Speaker 3:  That last one was Hank Green.

32
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,380
Speaker 8:  I like it here on the internet. I feel good about it.

33
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,420
Speaker 3:  Hank's been a YouTuber since 2007. He joined the partner program

34
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,260
Speaker 3:  back then and has been making 55% of the ad revenue on his videos ever since.

35
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,100
Speaker 8:  I have an educational media company, it almost entirely makes its money

36
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,900
Speaker 8:  through online video content, and about a third

37
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,060
Speaker 8:  to 40% of our revenue is that money. It's huge.

38
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,900
Speaker 8:  It's a really big deal for us. So that is really important and created a

39
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,780
Speaker 8:  really healthy economic ecosystem around YouTube

40
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,480
Speaker 3:  Content. The partner program built a dynamic where when YouTube as a

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,280
Speaker 3:  platform does better and their numbers and ad revenues go up, creators share

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,000
Speaker 3:  in that success. YouTube's partner program remains popular all these years

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,200
Speaker 3:  later, and the service has largely carried on in a league of its own,

44
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,520
Speaker 3:  but talk's arrival and soaring popularity has threatened

45
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,640
Speaker 3:  YouTube's throne.

46
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,440
Speaker 3:  Recent data shows that people's average watch time is now higher on TikTok

47
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,280
Speaker 3:  than YouTube's. Shortform algorithm driven feed

48
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,040
Speaker 3:  has inspired copycats from Snap, Instagram and YouTube themselves,

49
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,280
Speaker 3:  and they're all competing for top creators.

50
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,520
Speaker 3:  But TikTok and others have yet to master the whole paying creators

51
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,240
Speaker 3:  thing, which could be a problem competitively for them. I talked to

52
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,160
Speaker 3:  Professor Casey Feiser who researches online communities and tech ethics

53
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,360
Speaker 3:  at uc, Boulder.

54
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,520
Speaker 10:  I think that YouTube especially has created an

55
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,480
Speaker 10:  expectation that content creators can make a living

56
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,960
Speaker 10:  from this and that some of that living should

57
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,040
Speaker 10:  probably come from the people who are making money off of

58
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,920
Speaker 10:  their content.

59
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,400
Speaker 3:  She's talking about the platforms who indeed are making boatloads of money.

60
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,400
Speaker 3:  TikTok made an estimated 4 billion in revenue in

61
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,200
Speaker 3:  2021 and is on track to triple that this year. Instagram made

62
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,080
Speaker 3:  over 47 billion last year.

63
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,320
Speaker 10:  I imagine that TikTok considered whether they could have a similar kind

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,880
Speaker 10:  of revenue model to YouTube, but it is more of a challenge

65
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,640
Speaker 10:  because on YouTube, advertisements are directly on

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,840
Speaker 10:  specific videos. So an ad share makes a lot of sense on TikTok. That's

67
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,440
Speaker 10:  not quite how it works. You

68
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,360
Speaker 3:  Mean these are short videos basically and you can't as easily just

69
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,240
Speaker 3:  slap an ad on it,

70
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,040
Speaker 10:  Right? Well, so if you're scrolling through TikTok, you'll see like

71
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,200
Speaker 10:  video, video, video, video, ad, video, video.

72
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,120
Speaker 10:  So where does the revenue from that ad go?

73
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,920
Speaker 10:  And so I imagine they decided to come up with a different model and the

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,080
Speaker 10:  creator fund was what they came up with.

75
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,890
Speaker 3:  TikTok launched its creator fund in July, 2020.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,770
Speaker 11:  TikTok is making a billion dollar investment in the creators making

77
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,610
Speaker 11:  a difference on the platform, launching the TikTok creator fund.

78
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,570
Speaker 11:  The project is starting out with 200 million in the US with

79
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,410
Speaker 11:  plans to reach 1 billion

80
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,930
Speaker 3:  Soon. Other platforms marched out their own similar plans.

81
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,210
Speaker 3:  In Lead 2020, snap launched Spotlight offering 1

82
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,210
Speaker 3:  million a day to creators in 2021. Meta

83
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,170
Speaker 3:  promised 1 billion in bonus programs and YouTube

84
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,570
Speaker 3:  announced a hundred million fund towards creators of shorts. It's answer

85
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,930
Speaker 3:  to TikTok. All of the creator funds work slightly differently and have various

86
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,490
Speaker 3:  requirements to join. For us, US-based TikTok ERs. To get your hands on some

87
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,410
Speaker 3:  of that fund money, you have to be over 18, have over

88
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,010
Speaker 3:  10,000 followers and over a hundred thousand views in the past 30 days. All

89
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,890
Speaker 3:  this money in the Creator Fund seemed like good news to a lot of TikTok

90
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,610
Speaker 3:  creators who rushed to join as soon as they could.

91
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,200
Speaker 12:  So when I hit 10,000 followers at that point, I was at the

92
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,320
Speaker 12:  fashion company that I was working for. I was making 40 k, and I was like,

93
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,200
Speaker 12:  I can use any extra penny that I can get. So I joined the

94
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,400
Speaker 12:  Creator Fund instantly.

95
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,440
Speaker 3:  That's 26 year old Philadelphia based creator Brandon Edelman,

96
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,440
Speaker 12:  Commonly known as Brand Slate. I create like a lot of

97
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,280
Speaker 12:  off the rip chaotic content,

98
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,640
Speaker 12:  mostly videos of me talking to the camera, telling stories,

99
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,600
Speaker 12:  a lot of party content. I tell people that like I'm a lifestyle

100
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,440
Speaker 12:  creator, but my lifestyle is like crazy partying, chaos,

101
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,680
Speaker 12:  kind of like Jersey Shore and the TikTok creator,

102
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,960
Speaker 3:  Brandon started making TikTok videos in January, 2021,

103
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,840
Speaker 3:  mainly just for his friends.

104
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,840
Speaker 12:  And then June, 2021, the vaccine had just come out. So I was like

105
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,520
Speaker 12:  going out all the time, like the world was just like in a fun hobby place.

106
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,120
Speaker 12:  It was summer and I was just doing so many things and I kept posting on

107
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,640
Speaker 12:  TikTok and I started like blowing up a little bit and then I hit like

108
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,280
Speaker 12:  10,000 followers in July of 2021 and

109
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,840
Speaker 12:  now like a year and some change later at Math 330,000

110
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,280
Speaker 3:  When he became eligible for the creator fund, Brandon wanted to see how much

111
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,920
Speaker 3:  he could make, but he says he was a little skeptical because a lot of people

112
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,680
Speaker 3:  he knew reported a drop in views after they joined the creator

113
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,400
Speaker 3:  fund. TikTok denies this happens, but it is something lots of

114
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,240
Speaker 3:  TikTok creators have complained about, but Brandon himself saw no

115
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,440
Speaker 3:  dip in his numbers after joining

116
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,000
Speaker 12:  July and August of 2021, like all my videos were getting like between

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,840
Speaker 12:  80 to like 350,000 views. I was making like

118
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,040
Speaker 12:  probably four to $500 a month off the creator fund. So for me that was

119
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,440
Speaker 12:  great, was paying my utilities every month. How

120
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,960
Speaker 3:  Does it work like exactly? Do you, do you know how many views you

121
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,440
Speaker 12:  Need? This is like another thing that's never explicitly confirmed.

122
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,120
Speaker 12:  I think a ratio that's not obviously perfect, but I think it's

123
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,920
Speaker 12:  pretty on the money is you get like 4 cents

124
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,920
Speaker 12:  per a thousand views, but that is your views

125
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,560
Speaker 12:  for the whole day. I have 800 videos on my channel. So

126
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,120
Speaker 12:  like if you post a video today that goes viral and a bunch of people start

127
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,160
Speaker 12:  clicking your profile and they watch other ones, that all counts. If I post

128
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,080
Speaker 12:  a video today and it gets a million views, I'll probably

129
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,640
Speaker 12:  get $20 for that day.

130
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,040
Speaker 3:  See, TikTok hasn't laid out a formula for exactly what it takes to

131
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,200
Speaker 3:  earn money. They don't say, if you get a million views a day, you'll get

132
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,080
Speaker 3:  $20 instead, creators are left doing their own math and

133
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Speaker 3:  some have taken a TikTok to share their earnings.

134
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,480
Speaker 13:  So I joined the TikTok creator Fund on January 28th of this year,

135
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,320
Speaker 13:  and in that time I've only made $17. Not

136
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,440
Speaker 13:  that good at all.

137
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,600
Speaker 14:  I was getting 20, $30 a day. You

138
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,160
Speaker 15:  Can see that I'm making a few dollars each

139
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,280
Speaker 16:  Day. I get paid anywhere from 30 to

140
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,240
Speaker 16:  150 bucks.

141
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,640
Speaker 3:  The numbers are all over the place and so are people's feelings about it.

142
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,650
Speaker 3:  Some people said it felt felt like free money for doing nothing. Others

143
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,770
Speaker 3:  thought they should be earning a lot more considering how much energy they

144
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,610
Speaker 3:  put into producing content. I asked Brandon if he wishes TikTok were

145
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,890
Speaker 3:  more transparent about how to make money from the fund.

146
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,010
Speaker 12:  I do. Yeah. Like I wish it was like a system, but like also I don't really

147
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,890
Speaker 12:  like know how helpful that would be because TikTok is random. When

148
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,850
Speaker 12:  you go on TikTok on every page you have a following and then a for

149
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,530
Speaker 12:  you, TikTok puts your for you page first. So you could follow somebody

150
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,530
Speaker 12:  and never see their videos. They might never come up on your for you page.

151
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,530
Speaker 12:  So even if they said like, oh, if you get 30,000 views a day,

152
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,090
Speaker 12:  you're gonna get $5. I can do my best to make a video that I

153
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,570
Speaker 12:  think we'll get 30,000 views, but it could get 3 million. It could get

154
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,290
Speaker 12:  three. You never know. Like there are videos that sometimes that I post

155
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,850
Speaker 12:  and like, this is so funny, my followers are gonna love this, and they flop.

156
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,050
Speaker 12:  And then there's other videos that like, like the other day I took a five

157
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,490
Speaker 12:  second video of me eating Chick-fil-A in a parking lot with my friend. I

158
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,970
Speaker 12:  was like, oh, if you have a mental breakdown today, eat Chick-fil-A in the

159
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,290
Speaker 12:  parking lot with your friend. I'm like, oh, this is gonna get like 15,000

160
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,810
Speaker 12:  views, 890,000 views. You never know.

161
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,730
Speaker 12:  So would it be helpful, would it be nice if they were transparent?

162
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,410
Speaker 12:  Yes. But I don't really know how that

163
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,770
Speaker 12:  would like help motivate people as a creator because I mean, at the end

164
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,530
Speaker 12:  of the day, it's very random.

165
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,530
Speaker 3:  Brandon's right? He can't really control what the algorithm is gonna do.

166
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,890
Speaker 3:  Despite some creator's best efforts to game the algorithms, they're dealing

167
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,330
Speaker 3:  with two secret black boxes controlled by the platform here. One,

168
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,210
Speaker 3:  how the algorithm works to make their content go viral or not. And two,

169
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,170
Speaker 3:  how the creator fund is calculating payments. They don't know either of these

170
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,690
Speaker 3:  things, and that's a precarious dynamic for content creators who wanna make

171
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:33,890
Speaker 3:  money.

172
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,530
Speaker 10:  TikTok is almost a hundred percent

173
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,570
Speaker 10:  recommendation. If the recommendation algorithm on

174
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,930
Speaker 10:  TikTok pushes out your content, you make more money.

175
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,130
Speaker 10:  If it does not push out your content, you do not make money. And

176
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,450
Speaker 10:  that is nothing that you have control. Over.

177
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,930
Speaker 3:  The hundreds of videos that Brandon has posted since July, 2021 when he

178
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,850
Speaker 3:  joined the Creator fund has netted him a bit over

179
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,450
Speaker 3:  $8,000. Not enough to live on, but luckily the creator fund is

180
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,370
Speaker 3:  in all Brandon's got, it's just one small revenue stream behind the other

181
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,010
Speaker 3:  ways. He's figured out how to make money on TikTok and Instagram. This past

182
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,130
Speaker 3:  July, Brandon realized he could earn enough as a creator to go at it

183
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,290
Speaker 3:  full-time, mainly through brand deals and ads. So he quit his nine to

184
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:20,530
Speaker 3:  five job.

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,850
Speaker 12:  I think people get confused when they're like, oh, like your full-time job

186
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,370
Speaker 12:  is TikTok. My yearly salary is not $8,000.

187
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,970
Speaker 12:  Like that is passive income. It's literally a third source

188
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,650
Speaker 12:  of income that I can like rely on like just for like, like I said, utilities.

189
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,490
Speaker 12:  It pays my electricity, my water bill, that's it. I've signed brand

190
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,050
Speaker 12:  deals with ad agencies that are $10,000 for one video.

191
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,290
Speaker 12:  So in that sense, it doesn't pay you shit.

192
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,450
Speaker 3:  It sounds like the Creator Fund is not the thing that made you quit your

193
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:49,890
Speaker 3:  day job.

194
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,040
Speaker 12:  No, definitely not. No. I don't think anyone could solely

195
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,760
Speaker 12:  live off the creator fund except for maybe like

196
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,840
Speaker 12:  celebrities.

197
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,840
Speaker 3:  I talked to Hank Green about what it is that TikTok does give

198
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,440
Speaker 3:  creators.

199
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,680
Speaker 8:  It is very good at giving videos a chance. And so

200
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,280
Speaker 8:  you might end up with a video, an account that has zero followers

201
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,800
Speaker 8:  and has uploaded 20 videos and like their 20th video

202
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,800
Speaker 8:  is actually really good, or it's like something exceptionally funny happened

203
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Speaker 8:  and then that video gets 10 million views.

204
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,840
Speaker 3:  So TikTok is not giving a ton of money, but it does give sort of

205
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,360
Speaker 3:  virality

206
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,680
Speaker 8:  Attention and especially early in a creator's career, that's

207
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,440
Speaker 8:  the most valuable thing. And then you have to figure out how to turn that

208
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,080
Speaker 8:  attention into something that's gonna be sort of a more long-lived fuel in

209
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,360
Speaker 8:  the tank.

210
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,600
Speaker 3:  And Brandon's an example of somebody who's been able to do just that, turn

211
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,520
Speaker 3:  his virality on TikTok into a career.

212
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,840
Speaker 12:  I mean, it definitely is a hustle, but I've, I've never been more busy.

213
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,280
Speaker 12:  I've never worked harder, but I've also never been so successful.

214
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,200
Speaker 12:  So it's, it's all it's you take the good with the

215
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,090
Speaker 3:  Bad's. Creator fund is just one model. When Snap got into the paying

216
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,970
Speaker 3:  creator's game, they handed out big, big checks. We'll have

217
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,250
Speaker 3:  that after the break.

218
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,590
Speaker 3:  Snaps foray into paying their creators for short form. Videos went a

219
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,430
Speaker 3:  different direction than TikTok Snaps program was a lesson in how to

220
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,070
Speaker 3:  make creators rich, drive growth and help bump your stock price

221
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,630
Speaker 3:  at least temporarily.

222
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,590
Speaker 3:  I talked with Mike Metzler, a social and streaming analytics researcher

223
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,990
Speaker 3:  whose side hustle is making Corgi content.

224
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,070
Speaker 3:  Okay, it's not all Corgi content, but that's how we first got going on Snapchat

225
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,910
Speaker 3:  back in 2014.

226
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,910
Speaker 17:  I started on Snapchat because I knew that there was probably money to be

227
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,990
Speaker 17:  made and I've always approached a lot of these

228
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,190
Speaker 17:  platforms with, you know, is this a way to make money in my free time?

229
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,630
Speaker 17:  And it's more possible than ever to do that.

230
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,600
Speaker 3:  Mike made some money early on with Snap through brand partnerships, but he

231
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,400
Speaker 3:  said that had dried up for him when Snap announced Spotlight in November,

232
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,120
Speaker 3:  2020. Spotlight is a feature that looks a lot like TikTok or Instagram reels.

233
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,040
Speaker 3:  Instead of seeing snaps from your friends, there's a general entertainment

234
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,000
Speaker 3:  feed of Snaps selected content and anybody can submit their

235
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,840
Speaker 3:  stories to be featured there. Those who got picked were

236
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,400
Speaker 3:  initially capable of getting a piece of the 1 million

237
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,760
Speaker 3:  per day that Snap was offering to creators back then.

238
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,560
Speaker 17:  So I started posting on Snapchat Spotlight the day it came out. Yeah,

239
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,760
Speaker 17:  I posted for about a month and then I got a notification

240
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,320
Speaker 17:  that was like, Hey, you've made some money, but it didn't tell you how much

241
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,120
Speaker 17:  it was. I got a notification, you know, two or three weeks

242
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,600
Speaker 17:  later that I was getting $25,000. Whoa.

243
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,400
Speaker 17:  And then I posted some more and I got another notification that was like,

244
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,160
Speaker 17:  all right, now you've made $37,000.

245
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,800
Speaker 3:  Do you remember what your video was about? That was the most profitable there.

246
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,080
Speaker 17:  I was trying to make a, here's how to open a

247
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,680
Speaker 17:  pomegranate. And I opened it up and it was

248
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,600
Speaker 17:  completely rotted on the inside. So it was kind of one of those videos

249
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,200
Speaker 17:  where, you know, you, you get hooked in something different happens than

250
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,240
Speaker 17:  what you're expecting. And so it was, it was honestly a good internet type

251
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,440
Speaker 17:  video.

252
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,320
Speaker 3:  Mike wasn't the only one making life changing amounts of cash from Spotlight.

253
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,160
Speaker 3:  There were people, many of them teenagers making over a million dollars

254
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,920
Speaker 3:  in a matter of months. But like's Creator Fund,

255
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,400
Speaker 3:  nobody knew exactly what it took to get featured and paid out on Spotlight.

256
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,960
Speaker 3:  So creators banded together to try and figure it out.

257
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,400
Speaker 17:  I've been in a lot of different creator communities, so we started talking

258
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,800
Speaker 17:  immediately and trying to figure out what's the minimum threshold for what

259
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,520
Speaker 17:  it's gonna take to get a payout. And for Snapchat Spotlight, it was kind

260
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,760
Speaker 17:  of arbitrary. Whenever it started you could probably qualify with like a

261
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,360
Speaker 17:  50,000 views on a video, and now it's between 300 and

262
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,880
Speaker 17:  400,000 to get like a $300 payout.

263
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,440
Speaker 3:  Part of why it got harder to earn money was added competition

264
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,760
Speaker 17:  As soon as the word was out that people were making literally

265
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,600
Speaker 17:  millions of dollars. It became extremely competitive and the,

266
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,160
Speaker 17:  the landscape changed almost overnight.

267
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,240
Speaker 3:  And that's one of the biggest critiques of creator funds. Hank Green points

268
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,640
Speaker 3:  out that when you have a fixed amount of money set aside and more and more

269
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,520
Speaker 3:  people qualify to join, that money is gonna spread around much more

270
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,160
Speaker 3:  and the payouts to an individual creator are going to go down.

271
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,080
Speaker 8:  It's just a, it's a pretty simple math problem. You're dividing the same

272
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,840
Speaker 8:  number by a bigger number in general. As a platform succeeds more,

273
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,920
Speaker 8:  the creators actually make less. And that seems quite wrong

274
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,280
Speaker 3:  For Snap. It wasn't just the added competition of more creators on the platform,

275
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,320
Speaker 3:  it also stopped pouring so much cash into its fund. In

276
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,920
Speaker 3:  2021, the company announced they were shrinking the pot of money from

277
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,760
Speaker 3:  1 million per day to an unspecified millions

278
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,480
Speaker 3:  per month. And then just in October, they announced another reduction

279
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,360
Speaker 3:  to millions per year. Mike said, for all these reasons, he stopped

280
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,560
Speaker 3:  seeing any traction on Spotlight and started focusing on other platforms.

281
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,040
Speaker 17:  I kind of moved towards Facebook reels and Instagram reels, which was

282
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,000
Speaker 17:  more profitable use of my time.

283
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,120
Speaker 3:  Okay, so you moved that way cuz it seemed like that's where the money was

284
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,280
Speaker 3:  going.

285
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,080
Speaker 17:  There was still money to be made on, on Spotlight, but I wasn't willing

286
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,160
Speaker 17:  to put into the effort that it was gonna take for me to do that.

287
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,560
Speaker 17:  Facebook and Instagram reels, I wasn't making nearly as much money

288
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,160
Speaker 17:  as I was making on, on Snapchat Spotlight, but it was easier. And you know,

289
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,160
Speaker 17:  I'm cool with an extra 400, 500 bucks a month, you know, just posting

290
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,920
Speaker 17:  videos on, on social, it's, it's almost passive income. And I think that

291
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,040
Speaker 17:  creators are getting a lot more savvy. You see

292
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,760
Speaker 17:  creators jumping in between these platforms for where they can make

293
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,440
Speaker 17:  the most money, where the best opportunity is. There's obviously a lot of

294
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,080
Speaker 17:  downsides such as, you know, big inconsistencies and the platforms being

295
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,440
Speaker 17:  able to, to change, you know, the rules at any given time,

296
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,280
Speaker 17:  right? For Facebook reels, for example, in August of

297
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,400
Speaker 17:  this year, they were paying two bucks for a thousand views and then they

298
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,520
Speaker 17:  dropped it by more than half, then it was 40 cents for a thousand views,

299
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,960
Speaker 17:  and that just happened overnight. And then you're like, oh, well it suddenly

300
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,720
Speaker 17:  just got much harder.

301
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,240
Speaker 3:  Platforms can use these funds to play Puppet master a little bit by dangling

302
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,560
Speaker 3:  cash. They incentivize people to make a certain type of content on their

303
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,080
Speaker 3:  app in the hopes of keeping the platform competitive. And you see this happen

304
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,760
Speaker 3:  again and again. Meta has been pushing reels on Instagram and Facebook,

305
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,480
Speaker 3:  not just by putting them in users feeds, but also by paying creators to make

306
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:18,680
Speaker 3:  them.

307
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,200
Speaker 8:  So if you're Instagram, you want people to create reels, you create a fund

308
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,320
Speaker 8:  and you say you can make money if you create reels. I did make a bunch of

309
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,480
Speaker 8:  money, especially during the early stages when they're paying a lot, and

310
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,000
Speaker 8:  then they sort of like cranked it down as they're like, okay, people are

311
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Speaker 8:  coming in. I, I despise that. That's like the ultimate,

312
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,280
Speaker 8:  not treating creators as partners, but instead treating them as like

313
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,400
Speaker 8:  an asset to be manipulated. Like, how do we get this

314
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,120
Speaker 8:  tree to grow in this place so that we can harvest it at the right time?

315
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,160
Speaker 8:  That's what it feels like. No one had a thought about like the, the soul

316
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,040
Speaker 8:  of the tree. They were just trying to get it to like, I feel like a crop

317
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,200
Speaker 8:  that is being fertilized rather than, I don't know, a person with a

318
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,280
Speaker 8:  business, like working with another business, trying to mutually grow

319
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,880
Speaker 8:  our businesses.

320
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,640
Speaker 3:  It may be tough for creators to keep up with the platforms, constant changes,

321
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,760
Speaker 3:  but for platforms, throwing money at the type of content they want can definitely

322
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,280
Speaker 3:  pan out.

323
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,800
Speaker 17:  In, in Snapchat's case, it worked after they really

324
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Speaker 17:  spotlight, everybody flooded to the app, they had record user growth, their

325
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,360
Speaker 17:  stock price hit some new highs. Now everything is going down. And

326
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,320
Speaker 17:  now they announced yesterday that they're, they're cutting that. So it's

327
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,000
Speaker 17:  not working. But for some of these other platforms,

328
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,920
Speaker 17:  it it is retaining users to keep them posting content on

329
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,880
Speaker 17:  there. And maybe that's all you can really hope for is we, we need

330
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,960
Speaker 17:  our best creators to continue to post content if we want people to stay

331
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,440
Speaker 17:  on this app,

332
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,080
Speaker 3:  These funds and these bonuses and stuff, do they drive you to wanna make

333
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,760
Speaker 3:  more videos?

334
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,160
Speaker 17:  Absolutely. It creates, you know, a lot of opportunity for

335
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,600
Speaker 17:  creators, but you really have to put in that grind, which is,

336
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,720
Speaker 17:  for me, I have a full-time job, you know, it's a fun

337
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,360
Speaker 17:  hobby. Or if my full-time income was related to these creator funds, I,

338
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,400
Speaker 17:  I would be stressed all the time.

339
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,180
Speaker 3:  Just two years after the Creator fund trend began, it's showing signs of

340
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,060
Speaker 3:  decline. In addition to Snap announcing a decrease in funding, YouTube

341
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,540
Speaker 3:  said that it's shifting its shorts towards a revenue sharing model, and Meta

342
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,260
Speaker 3:  has introduced a new music revenue sharing model for reals. Revenue sharing

343
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,900
Speaker 3:  might mean less random easy money for those creators who've cashed out on

344
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,460
Speaker 3:  that, but it also means creators could grow more as the platform grows.

345
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,860
Speaker 3:  It's a really different model than creator funds where more growth on the

346
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,340
Speaker 3:  platform can lead to diminishing returns. For creators,

347
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,660
Speaker 8:  It's a gift instead of a partnership with YouTube, our

348
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,460
Speaker 8:  content is the thing you sell the ad-on, like, without my video, you

349
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,220
Speaker 8:  didn't sell that ad. That's the fundamental nature of it. So let's share

350
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,180
Speaker 8:  that revenue. Whereas with TikTok, it's like you created TikTok

351
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,060
Speaker 8:  videos, here's a present from us, it's a hundred bucks. Like

352
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,780
Speaker 8:  it's not shared revenue. It's an amount of money they've allocated to

353
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,260
Speaker 8:  creators.

354
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,210
Speaker 3:  Hank says the platforms are having to navigate the balance between providing

355
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,690
Speaker 3:  a great user experience versus a profitable experience for creators.

356
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,930
Speaker 8:  TikTok really is a very user first experience where it's,

357
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,810
Speaker 8:  it's designed to be the best experience for the person viewing the content

358
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,330
Speaker 8:  and to, to really lower the friction for the people creating the content,

359
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:23,130
Speaker 8:  like to allow creation to be very easy, but not to be certainly

360
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,290
Speaker 8:  isn't the best experience as a creator. You know, it's, it's very uncertain.

361
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,170
Speaker 8:  People get their accounts banned all the time. You don't make very much money.

362
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,690
Speaker 8:  And YouTube was kind of like this for a while too. It was really user

363
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,770
Speaker 8:  experience focused, and then there were more and more and more

364
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,690
Speaker 8:  ads and that value to the YouTube and the value to YouTube creators got

365
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,930
Speaker 8:  higher and higher, but the value to the user got lower. And somebody who

366
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,330
Speaker 8:  comes in and takes that space, that makes sense to me. And then like TikTok

367
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,690
Speaker 8:  is gonna have to sort of like, make the user experience worse and worse in

368
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,170
Speaker 8:  order to make more and more money because that's your, that's what you're

369
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,610
Speaker 8:  trying to do. And then maybe something else takes that space, or

370
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,930
Speaker 8:  maybe YouTube takes it in the chin and, and meta takes it

371
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,570
Speaker 8:  in the chin to make a product that's gonna cost them a lot of money and not

372
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,530
Speaker 8:  make 'em very much so that they can compete instead of becoming Blockbuster.

373
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,170
Speaker 8:  It's a tricky little world, but ultimately

374
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,730
Speaker 8:  these platforms are optimizing for user

375
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,090
Speaker 8:  experience, which is meaning not optimizing for

376
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,970
Speaker 8:  revenue. You know, and, and I want them to optimize for user experience.

377
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,570
Speaker 8:  I want them to compete. I want them to get eyeballs on my videos, but that

378
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,770
Speaker 8:  really does mean that I'm making like not very much money per view and I

379
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,290
Speaker 8:  ha we like creators have to be really innovative to figure out how to make

380
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,130
Speaker 8:  that money back. Which honestly over the last 10 years, they've been pretty

381
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,530
Speaker 8:  innovative.

382
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,610
Speaker 3:  TikTok for one hasn't yet announced any move away from its creator fund,

383
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,850
Speaker 3:  but it's just a matter of time before the platform will have to figure out

384
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,520
Speaker 3:  better tools to pay creators to keep churning content. After all

385
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,560
Speaker 3:  viral hits don't last and TikTok can only be the hot new thing for

386
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:52,960
Speaker 3:  so long.
