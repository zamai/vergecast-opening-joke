Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of payment processing fees.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,520
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce and I am sitting here organizing my entire life

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,680
Speaker 2:  in Spotify. I think for the first time ever, I've been using this app for

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,000
Speaker 2:  over a decade and this is the first time I think I've ever done a full

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,280
Speaker 2:  reorganization of my life in here. And I'm doing it because there's

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,040
Speaker 2:  this one thing that has annoyed me about Spotify for forever, which is that

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,080
Speaker 2:  I have the music that I listen to when I'm in the car or I don't know,

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,760
Speaker 2:  at a barbecue or out with friends or just hanging out at home making dinner.

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,680
Speaker 2:  That's the music I would call like my music taste. And then

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,600
Speaker 2:  there's the music I listen to all day every day while I work. That's

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,480
Speaker 2:  the like Feelingsy instrumental music. It's a lot of movie

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,360
Speaker 2:  scores, it's a lot of kind of ambient bands that I like.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,560
Speaker 2:  I play it a ton, but I wouldn't call that the music that I like and like

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,480
Speaker 2:  really want Spotify to tell me more about. And yet every year at the

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,760
Speaker 2:  end of the year, Spotify gives you that playlist with all your favorite songs

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,440
Speaker 2:  and it's like you listened to the Batman soundtrack

18
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,200
Speaker 2:  650,000 times, maybe you'd like to hear that again.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,280
Speaker 2:  And I'm just like, that's not really what's going on here. And I kind of

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,040
Speaker 2:  always wanted Spotify to separate those things. Then when I had a kid

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,800
Speaker 2:  it got even worse because now I spend You know eight hours a day listening

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,240
Speaker 2:  to Elmo's song and I don't really want that in my algorithms either.

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,560
Speaker 2:  So I googled around and was like, this has to be a solvable problem. Spotify

24
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,560
Speaker 2:  has to have figured this out. And it turns out they kind of did. There was

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,520
Speaker 2:  this feature that Spotify rolled out in February of this year where

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,320
Speaker 2:  you can go into any playlist and you tap or click on the three

27
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,280
Speaker 2:  dots in the menu and you go to exclude from your

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,000
Speaker 2:  taste profile and you click it and it pops up this menu that says listening

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
Speaker 2:  to this playlist will have less impact on your taste profile and recommendations.

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,640
Speaker 2:  I don't know less means, but this is good news. This means I can dump

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,720
Speaker 2:  all the stuff that I wanna listen to all the time but don't want Spotify

32
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,880
Speaker 2:  to make recommendations based on into one place. So that's

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,000
Speaker 2:  essentially what I've been doing. I now have this monstrous playlist called

34
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,720
Speaker 2:  Music to Work to in Spotify that is just several hundred

35
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,600
Speaker 2:  songs so far of all the music that I play on repeat all

36
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,640
Speaker 2:  day every day while I work. And now I have another one called Kid

37
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,800
Speaker 2:  that is just kid music and I can just basically put that on and shuffle

38
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,360
Speaker 2:  it and do the same with my work music all day and neither one will get in

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,080
Speaker 2:  the way of what's in my on Repeat or my Discover Weekly or my Spotify

40
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,520
Speaker 2:  raps every year. This is the dream. I can't believe Didn didn't know about

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,840
Speaker 2:  this sooner. Oh my gosh, it's so much work to move all of my stuff around

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,520
Speaker 2:  in playlists, but I think it's gonna be worth it. Anyway, we have an awesome

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,000
Speaker 2:  show coming up for you today. I'm gonna tell you a story about a guy I met

44
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,920
Speaker 2:  in LA who's making a really different kind of computer

45
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,840
Speaker 2:  and then after that we're gonna talk about super apps because they're kind

46
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,800
Speaker 2:  of lingering in the news all the time. Everybody is trying to build

47
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,600
Speaker 2:  the one app in which you live your entire life and it turns out

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,960
Speaker 2:  it's really hard and really complicated. Elon Musk wants to do it now

49
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,920
Speaker 2:  and I just don't think it's possible all that is coming up in just a second.

50
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,120
Speaker 2:  But first I just realized I have like a decade worth of monthly

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,160
Speaker 2:  playlists. I've just been saving songs I like every month and now I have

52
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,000
Speaker 2:  a chance to actually put all of those together. I have so many playlists,

53
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,000
Speaker 2:  my Spotify is a disaster. I don't recommend ever actually trying to

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,920
Speaker 2:  solve this problem unless you really wanna solve this problem, but it's making

55
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,880
Speaker 2:  me feel better already. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

56

Speaker 3:  This podcast is supported by Humans versus Machines, a new series

57

74
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,510
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. I wanna tell you about this computer I saw a few months

75
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,750
Speaker 2:  ago, which is unlike any other computer I've ever seen.

76
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,670
Speaker 2:  I first saw it in a picture on Twitter in March of this year, but a

77
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,350
Speaker 2:  couple of months later I got to see it in person. The, Verge, VE and Pavich

78
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,990
Speaker 2:  and I went to LA, got an Uber up this windy Canyon

79
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,150
Speaker 2:  Road kind of near the U C L A campus in Westwood and we

80
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,790
Speaker 2:  went into this cool two story house right up against a canyon

81
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,150
Speaker 2:  and we met a guy named Keegan McNamara. I'll tell you more about Keegan

82
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,070
Speaker 2:  in one second, but first I have to tell you about this computer.

83
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,590
Speaker 2:  Keegan calls it the mythic one, Roman numeral one. It's all very

84
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,350
Speaker 2:  fancy and he built this thing himself like every single part of it.

85
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,070
Speaker 2:  I

86
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,550
Speaker 5:  Was pitching it as like something that looks very different from a normal

87
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,350
Speaker 5:  computer. It's made outta wood and it's functionally like very limited

88
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,990
Speaker 5:  compared to a MacBook. It's like a a limited computational experience.

89
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,430
Speaker 2:  The computer is in fact made out of wood, walnut and

90
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,390
Speaker 2:  maple to be specific. Keegan bought big blocks then sod

91
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,270
Speaker 2:  and chiseled them into a shape. I can really only describe as a

92
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,150
Speaker 2:  sports car typewriter. You have a slightly inclined tray

93
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,350
Speaker 2:  in the front where there's a mechanical keyboard with some white keys and

94
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,080
Speaker 2:  some beige keys and a brown leather palm rest. Then the

95
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,800
Speaker 2:  whole thing slopes dramatically upward. Like you're going up a cliff,

96
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,440
Speaker 2:  there's an eight inch screen in the middle, three little lights on the left

97
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,440
Speaker 2:  side and a keyhole and an ignition switch. Seriously on the right,

98
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,600
Speaker 2:  the slope goes up to this Peak just above the screen and then sort of

99
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,720
Speaker 2:  curves back down in the back. It looks like a retro

100
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,600
Speaker 2:  futuristic design from the 1950s. Like in the era when

101
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,720
Speaker 2:  TVs were in those huge wooden cabinets, this would fit

102
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,360
Speaker 2:  right in.

103
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,360
Speaker 5:  What my method was was like just look at a bunch of

104
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,520
Speaker 5:  really pretty things, You know things that I find to be beautiful or interesting

105
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,160
Speaker 5:  for aesthetic reasons. Read what people think about them, read about how

106
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,960
Speaker 5:  they were designed and like the people that designed them just sort of You

107
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,800
Speaker 5:  know, take it all in for a while. And then after doing that for like a month,

108
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,280
Speaker 5:  two months, three months, you kind of sit down and try to start doing the

109
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,040
Speaker 5:  the sculptural aspect of the drawing aspect And like things just

110
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,000
Speaker 5:  come. It's very weird. You don't, they're just kind of there in the

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Speaker 5:  background and you're not thinking about them. Like the unconscious is a

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,880
Speaker 5:  very strange domain. You know, like I had a friend

113
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,560
Speaker 5:  come over and he was like, oh so you made a car computer And I was like,

114
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,960
Speaker 5:  you, I kind, I kind of made a car computer. But like also it's different

115
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,720
Speaker 5:  in strange ways. You know, like it's just kind of a confluence of a bunch

116
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,000
Speaker 5:  of the the things that I find to be beautiful.

117
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,000
Speaker 2:  My absolute favorite thing about this computer is how you turn it on.

118
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,440
Speaker 2:  You put a key into that hole next to the screen and turn it to the right.

119
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,440
Speaker 2:  As soon as you do a red light turns on on the left side, then

120
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,480
Speaker 2:  you reach up and flip the ignition switch and the lights on the left blink

121
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,440
Speaker 2:  yellow and then green and then the computer turns on turning on. This

122
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,320
Speaker 2:  computer feels like launching a missile from a submarine in an old spy movie.

123
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,360
Speaker 2:  Commence underwater search it rules

124
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,920
Speaker 2:  the whole thing is powered by an intel nook, which is basically an

125
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,560
Speaker 2:  all-in-one configurable mini computer.

126
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,640
Speaker 5:  I mean the easier option would've been just like a raspberry pie. They expose

127
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
Speaker 5:  a bunch of pins and You know, make it make it super easy to like make stuff.

128
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,680
Speaker 5:  But I've experimented with raspberry pies in the past and I, I just in

129
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,160
Speaker 5:  general found 'em to be like rather underpowered. And this was something

130
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,600
Speaker 5:  when you're, when you're making something that's like luxurious and it feels

131
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,360
Speaker 5:  beautiful, you don't want it to be like stunted by the electronics. You want

132
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
Speaker 5:  it to feel like blazing fast. And I think that like modern intel processors

133
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,040
Speaker 5:  are You know modern like ram amounts, all this kind of stuff. They are

134
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,240
Speaker 5:  unbelievably whip fast when you're doing something relatively simple, right?

135
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,520
Speaker 5:  The only reason that they ever get bogged down is by something like Google

136
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,480
Speaker 5:  Chrome, which has just an unfathomable amount of complexity

137
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,360
Speaker 5:  in the software. But yeah, when you're doing like Unix C stuff, my God

138
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,840
Speaker 5:  and like an I seven from 2020 is gonna be

139
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:44,880
Speaker 5:  unreal.

140
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,960
Speaker 2:  There's also eight gigs of ram in here and 250 gigs of storage.

141
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,200
Speaker 2:  Both are in a certain sense massive overkill because this

142
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,320
Speaker 2:  computer doesn't run chrome or games or anything complicated at

143
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,960
Speaker 2:  all for Keegan, it's pretty much a text editor.

144
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,120
Speaker 2:  It runs an operating system called Nix oss, which is a version of Linux

145
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,960
Speaker 2:  that's designed to be super modular and configurable. If you want

146
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,880
Speaker 2:  tons of apps and UI stuff, nix OSS can do that. But

147
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,480
Speaker 2:  the way Keegan's computer runs, it's much closer to just a command line.

148
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,360
Speaker 2:  Keegan says he just wanted his computer to be a text editor for writing and

149
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,920
Speaker 2:  reading, not a full fledged computer in the way that we've come to think

150
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,160
Speaker 2:  of it with all the power and options and apps and distractions that come

151
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,680
Speaker 2:  with it. He has a MacBook that is great for MacBook things

152
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,720
Speaker 2:  with this. He wanted something else.

153
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,480
Speaker 2:  Oh and in case you're wondering about what kind of keyboard he would put

154
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,440
Speaker 2:  into a computer designed entirely for typing. Oh boy did that ever

155
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,760
Speaker 2:  send Keegan down a rabbit hole?

156
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,880
Speaker 5:  This is a god tier mechanical keyboard. Like this is like two different

157
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,440
Speaker 5:  key cap sets and they're P B T keys. 'cause I like the th of that and like

158
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,800
Speaker 5:  this is a a hot swap p c b underneath and like I have

159
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,920
Speaker 5:  like foam padding and an aluminum plate because I like a little bit of ping

160
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,480
Speaker 5:  this but not the pings of brass and like You know I'm, I mean you can, you

161
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,840
Speaker 5:  get, you're welcome to type on it here. I

162
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,080
Speaker 2:  Would very much like to what? Oh man,

163
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,480
Speaker 5:  The switches are hand lubed glorious pandas.

164
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,200
Speaker 2:  I mean these, these feel fantastic. Not wild about the arrow keys, but I'll

165
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,960
Speaker 2:  get you some. I should be clear here. He didn't build this thing

166
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,000
Speaker 2:  to like start a computer startup. It was more like a summer project

167
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,400
Speaker 2:  starting in the summer of 2022. Keegan was a few years out

168
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,680
Speaker 2:  of college and had done a couple of tech jobs but was kind of

169
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,480
Speaker 2:  disillusioned with the whole space and was trying to figure out what he

170
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,280
Speaker 2:  wanted to do next. And then one day he went to the Metropolitan Museum of

171
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,880
Speaker 2:  Art in New York City and happened upon an exhibit called Arms and Armory.

172
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,960
Speaker 5:  It's hard for me to explain it this way because it feels weird to say it

173
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,320
Speaker 5:  feels like it doesn't actually happen to people, but I literally had like

174
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,320
Speaker 5:  a light bulb moment. The main thing that occurred to me was like, these are

175
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,680
Speaker 5:  functional objects. They're guns, they shoot projectiles out of a

176
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,200
Speaker 5:  tube. You know it doesn't have ornamentation, it's not made out of like exquisite

177
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,680
Speaker 5:  materials, it doesn't have gold inlay, You know stuff like this. But there

178
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,600
Speaker 5:  were people 3, 4, 500 years ago that thought it was

179
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,560
Speaker 5:  worthwhile to add that additional layer of like, I don't know,

180
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,440
Speaker 5:  I think the right word is beauty onto a merely utilitarian object.

181
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,400
Speaker 5:  And I was like, man, nowadays that just doesn't really exist. Like, and

182
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,840
Speaker 5:  especially it doesn't exist for computers. I'd been thinking about

183
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,400
Speaker 5:  computers prior in like a, a philosophical sure way.

184
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,440
Speaker 5:  And so it was just, it was very natural for me to be like, that's the object

185
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,840
Speaker 5:  that is most tractable for me personally to work on.

186
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,480
Speaker 5:  And You know, I went home and sat down on my MacBook and I You know I like

187
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,440
Speaker 5:  you're like examining every single facet of the MacBook and like how it's

188
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,400
Speaker 5:  machined and what the choices are. And one of my gripes always with the

189
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,840
Speaker 5:  MacBook is like when you put it on a table and you rest your wrists on it,

190
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,290
Speaker 5:  there's like this, there's like this sharp edge that like digs into your

191
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,280
Speaker 5:  wrist like okay, there's something off here You know like and even

192
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,680
Speaker 5:  just the shape of it, it's like a metal rectangle. Sure, it's like a very

193
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,640
Speaker 5:  well machined metal rectangle, but it is just a metal rectangle and compared

194
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,520
Speaker 5:  to the sort of like form experimentation and engraving and all this kind

195
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,360
Speaker 5:  of stuff that that I saw in the guns, I was like yeah, this is just a completely

196
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,000
Speaker 5:  different design philosophy and I really, I think it's the design philosophy

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,680
Speaker 5:  of Johnny Ive right and You know I respect him like he's a good industrial

198
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,480
Speaker 5:  designer, but there's something about modern industrial design that feels

199
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,400
Speaker 5:  like very cold and inhuman to me. Whereas working with materials like wood

200
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,640
Speaker 5:  and leather You know, it can kind of seem like catch up front maybe. But

201
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,800
Speaker 5:  I think that what you end up having in terms of like the felt

202
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,320
Speaker 5:  weight and the psychological weight of the object after, after it's created

203
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,160
Speaker 5:  is just like it's warmer, it's nicer, it feels more personal,

204
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,120
Speaker 5:  it feels just like better overall.

205
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,800
Speaker 2:  Keegan became kind of obsessed with finding this ornate

206
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,760
Speaker 2:  beauty in these everyday objects. He got really into learning about

207
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,800
Speaker 2:  luthier the people who make and fix one of a kind guitars in their

208
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,680
Speaker 2:  workshops. He went to the house Ray and Charles Eames used to build the famous

209
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,960
Speaker 2:  Eames furniture in, which is now a museum.

210
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,440
Speaker 5:  When I went in I, I was sort of imagining too like what, what would

211
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,480
Speaker 5:  a computer that actually fits inside of this very eclectic, strange house

212
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,400
Speaker 5:  look like and You know. I think that this is perfect. Like I think that this,

213
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,520
Speaker 5:  this would match the aesthetic almost perfectly. Like maybe it's not quite

214
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,320
Speaker 5:  rectangular enough but it's really close and the materials are spot

215
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,040
Speaker 5:  on and I think it would fit really well in there too.

216
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,640
Speaker 2:  He also got really into fancy cars, not as a car guy but as a

217
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,960
Speaker 2:  design guy. What can you learn from the shape of a Bugatti?

218
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,200
Speaker 2:  What does the ultra high-end leather in a pagani make you

219
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,720
Speaker 2:  feel that's different from the other things that drive down the highway?

220
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,240
Speaker 2:  All that stuff, all those shapes and materials and feelings

221
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,800
Speaker 2:  swirling around in his brain went into what became the mythic

222
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,040
Speaker 2:  one.

223
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,760
Speaker 5:  This back curve right here that's like straight out of, out of

224
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,160
Speaker 5:  an Italian sports car. Okay, You know that's like the, the rear hip is something

225
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,000
Speaker 5:  that you, that you really don't see anywhere except for in Italian sports

226
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,720
Speaker 5:  cars, which I think that comes from big cats

227
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,800
Speaker 5:  like tigers and leopards and You know all these sorts of things.

228
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Speaker 2:  Keegan's other thing is that he only works with hand tools.

229
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:11,760
Speaker 6:  Sorry,

230
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,240
Speaker 2:  I wish I, he's had some practice in woodworking. He learned a bunch from

231
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,680
Speaker 2:  his dad growing up and took a guitar making class in college, but he also

232
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,400
Speaker 2:  just kind of decided to figure it out as he goes. Again, summer

233
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,320
Speaker 2:  project, not startup founder here, he uses a hand saw to cut the

234
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,840
Speaker 2:  wood into kind of its rough shape and then a mallet and chisel to do the

235
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,640
Speaker 2:  curves and then a spoke shave and a card scraper to get everything just

236
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,480
Speaker 2:  right. It's super, super, super tedious. But he says he loves

237
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,080
Speaker 2:  the actual process of woodworking but also what it means,

238
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,240
Speaker 2:  and this in our whole time together is where he got the most

239
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,000
Speaker 2:  philosophical about how he thinks about this stuff and he revealed

240
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,440
Speaker 2:  I guess what you might call the unified theory of Keegan McNamara

241
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,800
Speaker 5:  In Shintoism. There are these spirits called Kami that will come to

242
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,720
Speaker 5:  reside in objects that are made in the right way and You know the right

243
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,520
Speaker 5:  way is a, it's open to interpretation, but my personal interpretation and

244
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,760
Speaker 5:  just from like using power tools in general is that you're like

245
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,360
Speaker 5:  marring something and yeah, that's something that I care about in general

246
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,920
Speaker 5:  is like trying to, especially when it's in my own hands, crafting objects

247
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,880
Speaker 5:  that a KA could come to dwell in, in this, in this Shinto

248
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,440
Speaker 5:  spiritual understanding.

249
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,600
Speaker 2:  I asked him right after that if he felt like there was Kami in the computer

250
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,080
Speaker 2:  he made,

251
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,480
Speaker 5:  Yes, to me this feels like it has been crafted correctly. Like I You know

252
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,680
Speaker 5:  if I, if I were Shinto I would say, yeah, there's a commun in here. Like

253
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,680
Speaker 5:  for sure there's a commun in there. I love that it's, it's been crafted with

254
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,840
Speaker 5:  with care and under my understanding of the right way, which even if it's

255
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,880
Speaker 5:  wrong, I think has some importance.

256
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,400
Speaker 2:  Does all that sound sort of ridiculous and high minded to you? Like a

257
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,240
Speaker 2:  kid who made a computer just trying to tell you some mystical story

258
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,120
Speaker 2:  about it. If it does, trust me, you're not the only one. When

259
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,400
Speaker 2:  Keegan finished the computer earlier this year, put the key in the ignition,

260
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,720
Speaker 2:  booted it up, everything worked, all the lights, he was very excited.

261
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,320
Speaker 5:  Top 10 Keegan life moments kind of kind of thing. Yeah.

262
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,720
Speaker 2:  Then like you do, he decided to post about this new computer in a bunch of

263
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,520
Speaker 2:  places. He uploaded pictures of the mythic one to Reddit and Twitter all

264
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,360
Speaker 2:  with the same caption. I wanted a beautiful computer and couldn't find one

265
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,320
Speaker 2:  so I made my own. the whole thing went kind of viral on Twitter and

266
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,720
Speaker 2:  Reddit. Most people were really nice. They liked the throwback design and

267
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,320
Speaker 2:  the retro futuristic vibe. They liked the idea of making

268
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,480
Speaker 2:  computers that last and they loved, they loved the key

269
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,400
Speaker 2:  ignition. Some people actually wanted a mythic computer of their own, but

270
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,760
Speaker 2:  not everyone saw the world the way McNamara did. He pointed me to

271
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,040
Speaker 2:  a hacker news thread, which is the developer focused site where people talk

272
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,560
Speaker 2:  about stuff and it was brutal. Lemme just read you a few of these.

273
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,560
Speaker 2:  Oh Lord, another hipster. I think that's the top ranked comment here.

274
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,160
Speaker 2:  Another one says Hooray for their four years of instant mastery.

275
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,920
Speaker 2:  One says the pseudo intellectual tradd vibes were overwhelming. And then

276
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,880
Speaker 2:  another one says it's really cool that this 25 year old invented PC

277
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,680
Speaker 2:  case modification. There are a bunch like that.

278
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,600
Speaker 2:  Ultimately Keegan says he figures a lot of the backlash was to his writing

279
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,440
Speaker 2:  style. He'd also posted an essay about how and why he built

280
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,080
Speaker 2:  the mythic one. And to be fair, it does sound kind of pretentious.

281
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,000
Speaker 2:  Like here's one section. Despite little improvement in overall user

282
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,760
Speaker 2:  experience quality, there has been a colossal rapid growth of new applications

283
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,680
Speaker 2:  over the last three decades. Modern personal computers are like 1,001.

284
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,200
Speaker 2:  Multi tools made from plastic people deserve one in one tools made from high

285
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,560
Speaker 2:  grade steel. A good exercise here is considering the net impact of various

286
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,440
Speaker 2:  types of applications on individuals and societies. I mean you can

287
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,880
Speaker 2:  see how that might piss off some tech types You know what I mean? Say this

288
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,680
Speaker 2:  for Keegan though. I think he really does believe what he says. I

289
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,800
Speaker 2:  don't think he hates technology per se. He said that that to me a few times.

290
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,040
Speaker 2:  It's just that he believes there are better ways or at least other

291
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,680
Speaker 2:  ways to do things and it turns out that at least a few people

292
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,480
Speaker 2:  agreed with him enough to reach out and see if maybe Keegan might make them

293
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,640
Speaker 2:  a mythic computer.

294
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,920
Speaker 2:  One of those people was Max Novan Stern who has been around Silicon Valley

295
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,880
Speaker 2:  circles for a while and who is probably best known as the co-founder of

296
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,800
Speaker 2:  World Coin, the crypto company that wants to scan your irises and Max

297
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,480
Speaker 2:  had actually been rethinking his own relationship with technology recently.

298
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,880
Speaker 7:  Computers are these like tools for

299
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,840
Speaker 7:  liberation and also like tools for enslavement.

300
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,400
Speaker 7:  You know it's pretty bifurcated, right? Phones

301
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:37,200
Speaker 7:  kind of make you feel like shit, right? Right. Computers aren't very

302
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,160
Speaker 7:  productive or it's like hard to do productive work at your computer. It just

303
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:41,520
Speaker 7:  is.

304
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,880
Speaker 2:  A couple of weeks before Keegan posted about the mythic computer, max had

305
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,720
Speaker 2:  tweeted about wanting something basically exactly like it. This was his

306
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,640
Speaker 2:  tweet. It says, give me an e-reader with a chat bot and note system and nothing

307
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,280
Speaker 2:  else. Give me a typewriter with the same strip computers of their

308
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,120
Speaker 2:  dopamine faucets leave their crystal balls. Max and Keegan started

309
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,560
Speaker 2:  talking. They knew each other a little bit already actually, and then

310
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,400
Speaker 2:  reconnected about these shared device dreams and Max ended up giving

311
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,240
Speaker 2:  that same prompt to Keegan. No dopamine faucets, just crystal

312
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:12,640
Speaker 2:  balls.

313
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,120
Speaker 5:  So what are the dopamine faucets of a computer? Well, I think most of the

314
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,080
Speaker 5:  dopamine faucets actually just come from the internet. Pragmatically, you

315
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,920
Speaker 5:  can get like most of the stripping of the dopamine faucets by just

316
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,600
Speaker 5:  like heavily restricting internet access. In this case it's completely gone,

317
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,040
Speaker 5:  but in the case of the one that I'm building for him, there'll be like a

318
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,800
Speaker 5:  couple IP addresses that can get through the firewall, namely the ones to

319
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,520
Speaker 5:  like interesting open AI products

320
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,120
Speaker 2:  Chat. G P T was one of those crystal walls that Max was talking about.

321
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,720
Speaker 2:  Ultimately he landed on four things that he wanted in a computer. He wanted

322
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,240
Speaker 2:  a really good experience for writing and reading text. He wanted speech to

323
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,720
Speaker 2:  text transcription with the whisper AI so he could just pace around his office

324
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,680
Speaker 2:  and dictate to his computer. He wanted chat G B T integration and he wanted

325
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,880
Speaker 2:  a receipt printer so he could quickly print off a grocery list or a piece

326
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,120
Speaker 2:  of text and take it with him.

327
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,080
Speaker 7:  It's like a typewriter, a secretary you could dictate to

328
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,200
Speaker 7:  and then a researcher who can, you could ask questions

329
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,280
Speaker 7:  and they'll give you in plain text answers to those questions.

330
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,560
Speaker 7:  And so that's a word processor rhythm and cap board, whisper

331
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,280
Speaker 7:  transcription and then Chachi. BT

332
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,280
Speaker 2:  At first Keegan balked at some of this. His mythic one doesn't connect to

333
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,800
Speaker 2:  the internet at all and that's kind of part of his ethos. Again, this is

334
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,800
Speaker 2:  supposed to be a a quiet, serene kind of computer, but talking to Max

335
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,880
Speaker 2:  convinced him that if you could essentially boil the whole internet down

336
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,920
Speaker 2:  to a interactive text interface, that that felt more

337
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:43,000
Speaker 2:  right more in the spirit of what he was trying to do. And in the future as

338
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,840
Speaker 2:  more and more of the AI power can be run locally without any

339
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,920
Speaker 2:  connection at all, a computer like this could be just as powerful and not

340
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,760
Speaker 2:  ever need to be online. Eventually Max and Keegan agreed

341
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,160
Speaker 2:  on a design and a price. They didn't want to tell me the price on the record,

342
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,120
Speaker 2:  but think more like used Car money rather than MacBook Money.

343
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,920
Speaker 2:  Keegan spent the next few months on that computer and he finished it in late

344
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,800
Speaker 2:  July. He ended up calling it the Mythic two and he personally

345
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,480
Speaker 2:  drove it up to the Bay Area and delivered it to Max's house. Max is

346
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,080
Speaker 2:  unfortunately away on vacation for a while, so he hasn't used it yet. So

347
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,280
Speaker 2:  I don't know how he feels, but I know he was very excited to get it. Having

348
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,000
Speaker 2:  built two of these now and talking with folks about more commissions,

349
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,400
Speaker 2:  Keegan told me he's hoping this might be something like his career for a

350
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,960
Speaker 2:  while. He can be a computer luthier in a certain way

351
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,360
Speaker 2:  and in the process he seems to hope that he might help change the

352
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,320
Speaker 2:  way we think about computers altogether.

353
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,440
Speaker 5:  I can imagine a world where there are like You know eight different guys

354
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,040
Speaker 5:  spread out all across the place that like each are very interested in one

355
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,080
Speaker 5:  specific portion of like the metallurgy basically of a computer. You

356
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,520
Speaker 5:  got the guy who's doing the processors in his garage and you got the guy

357
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,440
Speaker 5:  who's like figuring out how to do e ink in his garage and then you got the

358
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,040
Speaker 5:  guy who's like doing the woodworking. I guess that's me. You know there's

359
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,200
Speaker 5:  like, there are different components that can be figured out in their entirety

360
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,240
Speaker 5:  sort of from scratch at like less capability than what is like industry

361
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,200
Speaker 5:  standard nowadays. But a lot of the time you don't need the

362
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,760
Speaker 5:  modern capabilities like you can get away with having worse,

363
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,360
Speaker 5:  worse hardware.

364
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,680
Speaker 2:  I've been thinking about this kind of philosophy for months and personally

365
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,640
Speaker 2:  I like my MacBook a lot, but I like the idea of a computer

366
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,240
Speaker 2:  that by design doesn't do everything, that does a couple of things

367
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,120
Speaker 2:  really well that feels more like a well made single purpose

368
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,260
Speaker 2:  tool than a kind of janky Swiss army knife. And I

369
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,020
Speaker 2:  especially like the idea of bringing the tech industry back to a place

370
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,740
Speaker 2:  of experimentation and ideas. It's a bummer that

371
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,860
Speaker 2:  everyone converged on metal rectangles for laptops and big candy

372
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,860
Speaker 2:  bar slabs of glass for phones. Those can't be the only ideas

373
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,860
Speaker 2:  or the right answers. I don't think there have to be right answers. When

374
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,180
Speaker 2:  I was talking to Max, he compared what Keegan is doing to the whole idea

375
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,940
Speaker 2:  of the resurgence of dumb phones. You know these devices

376
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,500
Speaker 2:  that make calls and send texts and really don't do much else.

377
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,420
Speaker 2:  I've been fascinated by these things like the light phone and the punked

378
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,460
Speaker 2:  for years because I think it's a really interesting and complicated thing.

379
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,500
Speaker 2:  How do you sell people? What is an objectively worse phone?

380
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,900
Speaker 2:  It's weird, right? And what does it actually need in order to be useful?

381
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,220
Speaker 2:  You think about it, right? Phone calls good texts, good. You probably need

382
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,940
Speaker 2:  Google Maps. You want something to play music, but do you add Snapchat? Do

383
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,700
Speaker 2:  you add TikTok? Do you add Instagram? Do you add a web browser? At what point

384
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,460
Speaker 2:  have you just rebuilt the thing? Only slightly worse? I

385
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,260
Speaker 2:  agree that these do everything all in one devices have tipped a little

386
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,100
Speaker 2:  too far, but it's really hard to figure out where the middle ground is.

387
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,840
Speaker 2:  Ultimately. The thing I've come around to is that actually maybe the answer

388
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,920
Speaker 2:  is lots of answers. Maybe we need to go back to a time where

389
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,680
Speaker 2:  instead of a smartphone that does everything, we should incorporate a few

390
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,040
Speaker 2:  specific tools back into our lives that do one thing and do it really well.

391
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,520
Speaker 2:  I'm not saying I'm trying to get rid of my laptop or smartphone because I'm

392
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,080
Speaker 2:  not, I'm really not. But I buy the idea that the industry should be big enough

393
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,720
Speaker 2:  to support lots of shapes, lots of sizes, lots of ideas about what these

394
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,960
Speaker 2:  things are supposed to do and how they're supposed to work. And as these

395
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,840
Speaker 2:  components get easier to source and even make from scratch and as more people

396
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,760
Speaker 2:  get familiar with how they work and how to use them, I think we

397
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,200
Speaker 2:  might be headed back to that. I don't know that I'd ever want a computer

398
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,480
Speaker 2:  made of wood, but I guess I'm glad somebody's making one.

399
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,920
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take a break and Then we're gonna come back and talk

400
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,720
Speaker 2:  about a very different, maybe completely opposite way of thinking about

401
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,320
Speaker 2:  interacting with technology. We're gonna talk about super apps. We'll be

402
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,600
Speaker 2:  right back.

403
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,280
Speaker 3:  This episode is supported by humans versus machines from the

404
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,280
Speaker 3:  producers of the world. As You know it, human versus Machines is a new podcast

405
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,160
Speaker 3:  series about the promise and perils of artificial intelligence With

406
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,600
Speaker 3:  host Gary Marcus, we've seen massive progress in artificial

407
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,480
Speaker 3:  intelligence over the last 70 years. Computers can now beat world

408
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,080
Speaker 3:  chess champions at chess when on jeopardy detect fraud, read

409
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,920
Speaker 3:  x-rays better than some radiologists and maybe even write like Shakespeare.

410
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,200
Speaker 3:  But how do we build an AI we can trust? The potential benefits of

411
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,000
Speaker 3:  AI are great, but so are the risks. In this special edition series,

412
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,880
Speaker 3:  Gary Marcus, cognitive scientists, bestselling author and AI

413
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,600
Speaker 3:  entrepreneur digs into AI history, present and future, bringing

414
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,360
Speaker 3:  to life some of the technology's most significant breakthroughs and failures.

415
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,240
Speaker 3:  He interviews engineers, scientists, philosophers, and journalists working

416
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,160
Speaker 3:  at the forefront of AI to explore how we got here and lays out

417
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,960
Speaker 3:  the vision of where we need to go next. Humans versus Machines with

418

436
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,740
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. The idea of a super app has been around in tech for a

437
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,540
Speaker 2:  really long time because it's really not that complicated a

438
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,300
Speaker 2:  concept, right? Basically what if you could do everything you needed

439
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,260
Speaker 2:  in one place instead of needing a million apps for a million different things?

440
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,740
Speaker 2:  And really there are two flavors of Super app. There's the kind that tries

441
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,500
Speaker 2:  to bundle a bunch of similar stuff into one app like Uber

442
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,420
Speaker 2:  trying to do ride sharing and food delivery and public transit tickets

443
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,660
Speaker 2:  all in one place. That's all You know, moving things from one place to

444
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,140
Speaker 2:  another. So they sort of make sense to put in one place that's a

445
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,340
Speaker 2:  semi super app I guess. But imagine if Uber also tried

446
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,100
Speaker 2:  to get you to video chat with your friends in the Uber app or book

447
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,820
Speaker 2:  doctor's appointments in the Uber app or watch your favorite shows in the

448
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,700
Speaker 2:  Uber app and look for an apartment in the Uber app. Now that

449
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:10,820
Speaker 2:  would be a true super app. Lots of companies have tried to build

450
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,780
Speaker 2:  a super app like that and only one has actually succeeded. We'll get to that

451
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,740
Speaker 2:  one in a minute. But more recently, Elon Musk has been talking about how

452
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,380
Speaker 2:  he wants to turn X the platform and company formerly known as Twitter

453
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,580
Speaker 2:  into a super app in its own right. Personally I think that is just

454
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,140
Speaker 2:  straight up impossible for a bunch of different reasons, but I figured I

455
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,420
Speaker 2:  should check that theory with a couple of people who know this space and

456
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,540
Speaker 2:  Elon Musk really well. So I brought in the verges, Liz Lipato and Alex

457
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,340
Speaker 2:  Heath to talk through it all. Alex Heath. Hello. Hi Liz

458
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,300
Speaker 2:  Lipato. Hello.

459
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,340
Speaker 9:  Hello.

460
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,860
Speaker 2:  That's a lot of energy for The Vergecast. Yeah,

461
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,940
Speaker 8:  Liz really won the Hello

462
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,580
Speaker 2:  There. Listen

463
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,340
Speaker 9:  Man, I'm hype

464
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,140
Speaker 2:  Whenever you tell Liz she gets to talk about PayPal, it all, it all just

465
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,060
Speaker 2:  falls apart, Which is actually okay, so I, I've been trying to figure

466
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,900
Speaker 2:  out where I wanna start with this because as we talk about super apps and

467
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,460
Speaker 2:  Elon, Musk and X and all this stuff, there are a lot of places we could go

468
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,020
Speaker 2:  but Liz, you have a very old book that you were just telling us about that

469
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,380
Speaker 2:  makes me think we should actually start about 25 years ago

470
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,820
Speaker 2:  with the first time Elon Musk tried to make X happen. You

471
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,540
Speaker 2:  are like deep in the history of this man and PayPal and

472
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,940
Speaker 2:  if you go back to the nineties, all the stuff Elon is trying to do now

473
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,620
Speaker 2:  he was kind of trying to do, or at least thinking about trying to do

474
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,940
Speaker 2:  back then, right? Like build the sort of one app that runs the

475
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,340
Speaker 2:  universe.

476
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,060
Speaker 9:  Yeah. So I guess one of the things that I just wanna like You

477
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,040
Speaker 9:  know, if you can think back into like the mys of time, if

478
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,840
Speaker 9:  you will, back to 1999, it was a very, very

479
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,600
Speaker 9:  different time on the internet as all of us who are online recall and

480
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,480
Speaker 9:  those of you who are not online due to not yet being born, I'm

481
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,800
Speaker 9:  sorry, Musk is one of the sort of original internet

482
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,200
Speaker 9:  entrepreneurs and he founded this business called

483
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,160
Speaker 9:  x.com in 1999, which was when he

484
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,600
Speaker 9:  thought it would be like a really cool idea to do

485
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,960
Speaker 9:  electronic payments, checking accounts, stock trading,

486
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,880
Speaker 9:  mutual funds and like I wanna be real, a lot of these ideas

487
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,720
Speaker 9:  seem pretty ahead of their time. At that point, nobody had

488
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,960
Speaker 9:  really figured out how to use an email address for payments, which is something

489
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,720
Speaker 9:  that like we all do now, right? And so part of what

490
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,720
Speaker 9:  what went on there was there was this unbelievable cash burn. Customers got

491
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,600
Speaker 9:  like a $20 bonus on a cash card when they signed up and like $10 for everybody

492
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,480
Speaker 9:  they referred. And then there were also all of these problems around

493
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,880
Speaker 9:  verification where they would give credit cards to just anybody who wanted

494
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,800
Speaker 9:  them up to like a $10,000 credit limit. And You

495
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,880
Speaker 9:  know Musk's sort of idea was just to onboard as many people as possible because

496
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,000
Speaker 9:  he wanted to have like a million people using the new credit card by the

497
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Speaker 9:  end of the year. And like this is like by the way Peter Thiel's retelling

498
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,120
Speaker 9:  of this, the million people. And so there were a lot of

499
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,120
Speaker 9:  bad checks, there were You know banks that wouldn't allow people to

500
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,040
Speaker 9:  have checking accounts. Who were you signing up for this card? They

501
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,840
Speaker 9:  had something like a 50% chargeback rate, which is completely wild.

502
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,040
Speaker 9:  There was just like a lot going on and there was a second startup called

503
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,520
Speaker 9:  Infinity that was Peter Thiels that ended up merging with

504
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,280
Speaker 9:  x.com because they were both burning money really fast and the VCs

505
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,120
Speaker 9:  involved were like, these are similar businesses, let's like see if we put

506
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,040
Speaker 9:  them together, if something good happens, let's burn

507
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,320
Speaker 2:  Money together, let's

508
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,800
Speaker 9:  Burn money together. And Infinity had this very popular

509
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:37,400
Speaker 9:  product called PayPal. Part of what went on there

510
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,400
Speaker 9:  is there was a conflict around PayPal, Musk

511
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,280
Speaker 9:  wanted to rename it to X and use a different kind of

512
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,880
Speaker 9:  software to run it or a different kind of code rather. And nobody

513
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,760
Speaker 9:  else wanted that. And so Elon Musk went on his honeymoon and

514
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,880
Speaker 9:  there was a palace coup and he was thrown out of x.com which

515
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,800
Speaker 9:  became known as PayPal and was is still successful today sort

516
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,360
Speaker 9:  of despite these sort of rocky beginnings,

517
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,560
Speaker 2:  Right? And if I remember right, even then they had this thesis

518
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,760
Speaker 2:  that like we want to do all this money stuff and

519
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,040
Speaker 2:  we think that if we can be sort of the conduit through which money flows

520
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,760
Speaker 2:  on the internet, we can solve everything. It's like there's a little bit

521
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,640
Speaker 2:  of like what people talked about with crypto that they're like if we can

522
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,480
Speaker 2:  fix internet money, we can, we can change everything about how everybody

523
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,440
Speaker 2:  does everything just through the money. Like were they talking about that

524
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,440
Speaker 2:  in the nineties or is everybody just like t conning that back into Elon

525
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,760
Speaker 2:  musk's history of x.com?

526
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,600
Speaker 9:  I mean I, I think that that was, that was sort of the primary goal because

527
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,320
Speaker 9:  if you think about how the internet works, it does seem to be missing a

528
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,800
Speaker 9:  protocol and that protocol is money. And so You know there have been a lot

529
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,400
Speaker 9:  of attempts to create a money protocol online and crypto

530
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,480
Speaker 9:  is one of them. But I think that was part of what these guys were thinking

531
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,160
Speaker 9:  about And when I say these guys, I mean both Musk and Teal when it came to

532
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,680
Speaker 9:  PayPal and like if you You know were listening to sort of my description

533
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,040
Speaker 9:  of x.com, it does sound a lot like what is called the quote unquote super

534
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,080
Speaker 9:  app that seems to be Musk's ambition now with Twitter.

535
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,040
Speaker 9:  And I do think that there is something pretty powerful about the idea of

536
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,640
Speaker 9:  having sort of a unified money protocol.

537
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,040
Speaker 9:  But the other thing that maybe is worth mentioning is that here in the US

538
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:24,320
Speaker 9:  banks got involved and so You know I, I have my banking

539
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,360
Speaker 9:  app on my phone, I can upload paper checks to my

540
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,800
Speaker 9:  checking account if I so choose by You know taking photos and things. And

541
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,600
Speaker 9:  so there are, I already have that particular offering and then on

542
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,920
Speaker 9:  on top of that, You know there's PayPal, there's Venmo, there's all of this

543
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,440
Speaker 9:  competition around ways that you can send money and ways that you can transmit

544
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:46,000
Speaker 9:  money online and then You know you think another layer you think about crypto

545
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,120
Speaker 9:  if you're involved in the crypto world, there's You know wallets, all sorts

546
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,920
Speaker 9:  of other ways to send money. So it's, it's a highly competitive space

547
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,680
Speaker 9:  much more so than it was in 1999. Right.

548
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,000
Speaker 2:  Which I think is why Alex, I'm curious how you have seen this space over

549
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,560
Speaker 2:  the years. 'cause I think you and I have both been covering the consumer

550
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,440
Speaker 2:  internet for a long time and I think it was like the mid 20

551
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:09,360
Speaker 2:  teens I think where somewhere along the way everybody who

552
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,840
Speaker 2:  made any kind of successful messaging or social

553
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,760
Speaker 2:  networking app started talking to me about wanting to be a super app

554
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Speaker 2:  in which you could do everything. And I think it's for the reason Liz just

555
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,480
Speaker 2:  described, which is basically like money on the internet got

556
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,400
Speaker 2:  like pretty easy and there were lots of ways to do it. And so everybody was

557
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,840
Speaker 2:  like, okay, how, what are, what is our lock in? And it was like okay, this

558
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,600
Speaker 2:  is where people hang out with each other. What else can we build on top of

559
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,480
Speaker 2:  that? And I feel like 20 like 15 everyone I know

560
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,520
Speaker 2:  was telling me that they were building a super app. Was that your experience

561
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:39,720
Speaker 2:  too?

562
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,960
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Were you in the audience when Facebook had its annual conference

563
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,880
Speaker 10:  in 2016? Do you remember the messenger chat bot craze?

564
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:48,560
Speaker 10:  Oh

565
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I do remember that.

566
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,880
Speaker 10:  So that was actually David Marcus at the time who was the former

567
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,760
Speaker 10:  president of PayPal was trying to bring this very

568
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,760
Speaker 10:  super at Vision that we'll get more into that Elon wants to do to

569
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,720
Speaker 10:  to messenger. And Messenger had 900 million monthly

570
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,400
Speaker 10:  actives already at this point. It was huge and they made this big

571
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,320
Speaker 10:  You know concerted effort to get developers to build these chatbots

572
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,960
Speaker 10:  inside Messenger. And the thinking was that you would do all kinds of things

573
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,440
Speaker 10:  besides talking to your friends, you would talk to businesses, you would

574
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,280
Speaker 10:  do customer support that way. And it bombed. I mean it,

575
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,200
Speaker 10:  it totally bombed And You know we can go many directions here,

576
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,080
Speaker 10:  but many years later, WhatsApp, Meta's other app is

577
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,080
Speaker 10:  actually probably the closest thing to what is a true global super app.

578
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,200
Speaker 10:  But that's been a much longer road and it's become that

579
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,160
Speaker 10:  in countries that are not the US or Western Europe for very

580
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,320
Speaker 10:  important reasons as well.

581
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no I think that's right. Well and I think we should, before we get

582
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,440
Speaker 2:  to WhatsApp, I think we should talk about WeChat just Yeah, briefly and I'm,

583
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,160
Speaker 2:  I'm curious as from both of your perspectives how you think about

584
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,080
Speaker 2:  WeChat because WeChat, as we talk about super apps, the like one

585
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,360
Speaker 2:  piece of software in which you live your entire life, WeChat is

586
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,880
Speaker 2:  the absolute smashing success story. It is like

587
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:10,920
Speaker 2:  every app you can think of all shoved into one app called WeChat that is

588
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,680
Speaker 2:  also where you talk to your friends and I feel like everybody I've talked

589
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,880
Speaker 2:  to for the last 10 years is just trying to do what WeChat

590
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,840
Speaker 2:  is doing. And that is like everybody's end goal. It's every what every VC

591
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,440
Speaker 2:  wants to fund, it's what everybody wants to build. Like this is the future

592
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,280
Speaker 2:  of everything Liz. Do you see a line between those

593
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,720
Speaker 2:  things? Like is the thing that PayPal was trying to do, what

594
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,960
Speaker 2:  WeChat managed to pull off? Obviously in China it's a very different country

595
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,680
Speaker 2:  with a very different evolution of the internet. Like did they kind of get

596
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,120
Speaker 2:  it right? Did did WeChat finish the job there?

597
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,800
Speaker 9:  So I think it's worth lingering on the differences between China

598
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,800
Speaker 9:  and the United States for a moment for sure because WeChat is

599
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,000
Speaker 9:  actually bigger than what the sort of vision originally

600
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,800
Speaker 9:  for x.com was. Because x.com didn't have the sort of social media

601
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,760
Speaker 9:  component where you can like post statuses, there was no idea of

602
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,440
Speaker 9:  finances being a kind of social media. Even though I think as everyone who's

603
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,960
Speaker 9:  used Venmo knows it is and in fact You know if you think about the dollar

604
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,120
Speaker 9:  bill that is actually media, right? You know it's, there's literally a photo

605
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,600
Speaker 9:  on it or not a photo I guess, but a print Well

606
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,080
Speaker 2:  And in the same way that all these other apps have started with something

607
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,680
Speaker 2:  else and sort of worked their way down to buying stuff. I think realistically

608
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,840
Speaker 2:  like if, if this had worked the way they wanted it to, you get to the point

609
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,560
Speaker 2:  where all of your money is moving around and then they start to look and

610
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,360
Speaker 2:  it's pretty easy to like pull lines out of that into let's let

611
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,120
Speaker 2:  people send each other money and talk about it and let's let them buy stuff.

612
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,600
Speaker 2:  Why don't we bring the store in here? Like you can see how you would arrive

613
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,360
Speaker 2:  at the same place even from the exact opposite direction.

614
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,280
Speaker 9:  That's exactly right. And so one of the things that I think is worth mentioning

615
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,120
Speaker 9:  about WeChat is specifically the Chinese Communist Party

616
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:50,320
Speaker 9:  which engages in a great deal of surveillance. So WeChat is

617
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,480
Speaker 9:  a very good way for Chinese authorities to keep an eye on what people are

618
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,320
Speaker 9:  doing, where they're sending money, who they're talking to and what

619
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,280
Speaker 9:  they're reading. Okay? And this is by the way, the downside of every

620
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,160
Speaker 9:  super app is that it is a one-stop shop for surveillance. And I don't mean

621
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,040
Speaker 9:  to suggest that the US government isn't surveilling us because as we all

622
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,920
Speaker 9:  know from Edward Snowden it is sure, but it's a little bit of a pain

623
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,960
Speaker 9:  to put together all of our various social media streams and like the stuff

624
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,560
Speaker 9:  that they're getting from wherever else and like this is like a one-stop

625
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,080
Speaker 9:  shop for the Chinese surveillance state. So

626
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,600
Speaker 9:  that's one way of thinking about these super apps and it's one way of thinking

627
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,560
Speaker 9:  about WeChat. Like it's very, very powerful both for the users and in

628
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,440
Speaker 9:  terms of social control. And so one of the things that I think is maybe

629
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,680
Speaker 9:  interesting here is that in a lot of places where these super

630
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,640
Speaker 9:  apps have traction, there are conditions that are very different than the

631
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,320
Speaker 9:  conditions in the United States. Either the banking industry isn't as developed

632
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,960
Speaker 9:  there and didn't get online as quickly, or there is a level of social

633
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,440
Speaker 9:  control from the government that there isn't here in the us.

634
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,440
Speaker 9:  And so I can see why Silicon Valley VCs

635
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,160
Speaker 9:  would love to have something like WeChat because that would be very powerful.

636
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,880
Speaker 9:  You know it would make you a lot of money and you, there's all sorts of things

637
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,720
Speaker 9:  you can do with all that data. But I don't know from a user perspective

638
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,440
Speaker 9:  why that's necessarily something you would want, especially knowing

639
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:16,000
Speaker 9:  that it really could ramp up surveillance, it really could do

640
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,240
Speaker 9:  things

641
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,680
Speaker 9:  that are maybe not in your interests. And again, like

642
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:25,680
Speaker 9:  this is just a basic difference between China and the us besides the fact

643
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,960
Speaker 9:  that there is a lot more competition here because the US government allows

644
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,080
Speaker 9:  a lot more competition around financial services.

645
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,360
Speaker 10:  And to put a finer point on what Liz is saying about WeChat in China, I

646
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,160
Speaker 10:  mean WeChat literally is an extension of the government in China. You can

647
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,800
Speaker 10:  have your government ID managed and

648
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,280
Speaker 10:  accessible inside WeChat. It is a sensor

649
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:50,200
Speaker 10:  apparatus for the government. And the reason WeChat became so

650
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,960
Speaker 10:  successful inside China when it did is because not only

651
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,920
Speaker 10:  does the government there censor from within, it also censors

652
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,160
Speaker 10:  out things from other countries. And so there was a vacuum where there were

653
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,760
Speaker 10:  not any other You know social networks, the most of which were getting created

654
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,480
Speaker 10:  in the western world allowed to even exist in China

655
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,320
Speaker 10:  officially. So WeChat became, You know the blessed service

656
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,560
Speaker 10:  by the CCP continues to be to this day and to Liz's other point

657
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,280
Speaker 10:  about money and about it being incredibly lucrative, it is. But

658
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,400
Speaker 10:  historically, and you can look at WeChat as a perfect example. It's owned

659
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,160
Speaker 10:  by Tencent, which is a mega cap tech conglomerate,

660
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,040
Speaker 10:  kind of similar to an Apple or an Amazon in China. WeChat

661
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,560
Speaker 10:  as a business actually doesn't make Tencent the majority of its money,

662
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,480
Speaker 10:  the majority of Tencent's money comes from its gaming business. They have

663
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,360
Speaker 10:  a cloud division, they're starting to do a bunch of AI stuff. These super

664
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:47,280
Speaker 10:  apps buy themselves are not wildly profitable. It's when you

665
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,160
Speaker 10:  attach them to these conglomerates that also have You know

666
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,640
Speaker 10:  historically the blessing of, of the government that that they operate in

667
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,640
Speaker 10:  the country they operate in. So it's, it's a very unique situation for for

668
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,040
Speaker 10:  WeChat.

669
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,080
Speaker 2:  Right? And so given that all of what you both just said, which is basically

670
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,080
Speaker 2:  there are like these giant systemic differences between these two

671
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,000
Speaker 2:  countries that would allow an app like that to work in China that would almost

672
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,320
Speaker 2:  certainly not allow an app like that to work somewhere like the United States.

673
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,480
Speaker 2:  And yet every tech company of a given size has this exact

674
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,640
Speaker 2:  ambition. Alex, you wrote a story a couple years ago looking particularly

675
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,400
Speaker 2:  at Snap, which you thought right was was kind of headed down this road and

676
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,040
Speaker 2:  had a, a real shot at pulling off some if

677
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,960
Speaker 2:  definitely not all, but some of that. Like

678
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,200
Speaker 2:  why did everyone get so obsessed with this if it's not a particularly good

679
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,800
Speaker 2:  business and there are a million really good reasons it's never gonna work

680
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,160
Speaker 2:  anyway.

681
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,280
Speaker 10:  Well, You know, Facebook meta has basically cornered the ads market for

682
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,480
Speaker 10:  these social apps. It's incredibly hard and Snap is living proof of this

683
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,800
Speaker 10:  with where their stock price still is today to compete with a scaled

684
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:55,240
Speaker 10:  digital ads business like that. It's really meta and Google and that's it.

685
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,960
Speaker 10:  No one's been able to take a meaningful share out of that. And so if you're

686
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,040
Speaker 10:  a Snap or you're a Discord or you're one of these kind of up and coming

687
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:06,320
Speaker 10:  growing social networks, you're looking at other ways to, to build a business.

688
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,000
Speaker 10:  And the Super App thing is, it's a, it's a sexy idea, right?

689
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,360
Speaker 10:  It's, it's also about time spent. If you're a social media site, you want

690
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,360
Speaker 10:  as much time spent in your app as possible and a super app is something

691
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,680
Speaker 10:  that people use all day every day. And so the thinking is can we bring more

692
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,640
Speaker 10:  activities? So like for example, snap tried a whole gaming platform, snap

693
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,280
Speaker 10:  Minis inside the app and they shut it down because they couldn't make money

694
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,160
Speaker 10:  from it and You know why they couldn't make money from it. Apple, this is

695
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,560
Speaker 10:  a thing that we don't talk about really as it relates to these digital apps.

696
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:40,080
Speaker 10:  The power that Apple as the distributor of these apps to the app store and

697
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,640
Speaker 10:  the way the app store rules work is extremely powerful. And guess what?

698
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,840
Speaker 10:  Apple doesn't like, they don't like app stores that compete with their own.

699
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,200
Speaker 10:  And so eventually you get down this, this road if you're building a super

700
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,360
Speaker 10:  app where you're a store within a store kind of idea.

701
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,040
Speaker 10:  And the only app really at scale that is allowed to get away with

702
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,000
Speaker 10:  this is WeChat. And there's been some reporting on this over the years that

703
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,400
Speaker 10:  basically, and I I believe this to be true, apple

704
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:09,160
Speaker 10:  knows that it will not sell iPhones in China without WeChat.

705
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,520
Speaker 10:  And so it's let WeChat do things that it will not let any other app of that

706
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,240
Speaker 10:  scale do. And that's why Snap's kind of mini

707
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,880
Speaker 10:  stuff failed. It's why You know Facebook has never been able to build its

708
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,760
Speaker 10:  own kind of store within Facebook. They've tried many times. This is starting

709
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,680
Speaker 10:  to loosen with some of the EU regulations specifically that will

710
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,360
Speaker 10:  allow competing app stores soon. But Apple is, is the main

711
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,080
Speaker 10:  hindrance I would say actually to building a super app outside of China

712
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,480
Speaker 10:  right now.

713
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,760
Speaker 2:  And is that just because a huge part of the business case there is is

714
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,440
Speaker 2:  just payment fees. Like if we can, if we can get shopping in our app, if

715
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,200
Speaker 2:  we can get people sending each other money in the app and we can take even

716
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,440
Speaker 2:  a relatively small percentage of it, that there's a whole lot of money to

717
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,560
Speaker 2:  be made doing that. And if you can't get any ad money, which you can't, that's

718
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,000
Speaker 2:  one way to potentially make a lot of money here. I

719
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,120
Speaker 10:  Don't know I would be curious to hear Liz talk about this because my understanding

720
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,600
Speaker 10:  is that payments businesses are not wildly profitable

721
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,560
Speaker 10:  businesses. They're actually pretty commoditized. The tech is

722
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,240
Speaker 10:  fairly standardized at this point. There's many competitors. There's Stripe,

723
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,040
Speaker 10:  there's a a n in Europe, the banks all have their own competing rails at

724
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,680
Speaker 10:  this point. The big ones, I'm not actually sure Payments is in and of itself

725
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,440
Speaker 10:  a a big business like Liz. I would actually, we could just get into actually

726
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,360
Speaker 10:  right now kind of what Elon wants to do with

727
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,800
Speaker 2:  X. I was just gonna say this is a perfect segue into this is a bad idea.

728
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,760
Speaker 2:  No one will ever do it. There's no reason to do it. And so Elon Musk is trying

729
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,640
Speaker 9:  Actually guys, I I wanna, I wanna pause here 'cause everything Alex is saying

730
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,640
Speaker 9:  is true. Payments is like not the most lucrative thing on

731
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,560
Speaker 9:  earth, but there is a brand new competitor that I do wanna talk about that

732
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,120
Speaker 9:  went live on July 20th of this year called Fed Now.

733
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,480
Speaker 9:  And it lets you as an individual or businesses if

734
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,720
Speaker 9:  they so choose, send instant payments through your

735
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,680
Speaker 9:  depository institution account, which is like usually a bank

736
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,440
Speaker 2:  Liz. I straight up thought you were just lying to me, like I thought this

737
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,160
Speaker 2:  was like an elaborate bit you were doing. I just googled this, this is real.

738
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,480
Speaker 2:  Sorry, keep going. Yeah,

739
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,840
Speaker 9:  It's from the Federal Reserve. They've been working on it for several years

740
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:09,640
Speaker 9:  now and it's potentially very, very powerful. It's a

741
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,440
Speaker 9:  brand new set of payment rails that we just, we haven't seen

742
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,880
Speaker 9:  how it's going to be used, used yet. You know there's, we have the first

743
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,640
Speaker 9:  release of it, there's like fraud prevention tools. There's a number of

744
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,960
Speaker 9:  support capabilities and I think that if you're

745
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,840
Speaker 9:  thinking about payments in a very serious way, the US federal

746
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,920
Speaker 9:  government has just given you some competition.

747
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,840
Speaker 9:  So that's, that's maybe also worth keeping in mind.

748
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,800
Speaker 10:  Liz I would love for you to just react to this. So, so Elon held his first

749
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,200
Speaker 10:  meeting when he took over Twitter in November. I got an audio

750
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,600
Speaker 10:  recording of the entire conversation and put the full transcript on The

751
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,480
Speaker 10:  Verge at the time. And there's a section kind of in the middle of the meeting

752
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,880
Speaker 10:  where he gets into the, the payments ideas that he wants to implement at

753
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,560
Speaker 10:  Twitter before it was X. And there's this one line

754
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:02,560
Speaker 10:  that I think really gets to the heart of what he thinks the reason people

755
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,520
Speaker 10:  will want to transact through Twitter will be. And he says, if you can

756
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,480
Speaker 10:  simply have one balance on Twitter that can simply go positive or negative.

757
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,760
Speaker 10:  And when it goes positive, the interest rate is better than you could receive

758
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,280
Speaker 10:  elsewhere. And when it goes negative, the interest rate is lower than you

759
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,160
Speaker 10:  see elsewhere. Now you have a much simpler system. Is that actually

760
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,560
Speaker 10:  a compelling reason to do any of this? And is this something that is gonna

761
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,400
Speaker 10:  get people to transact in Twitter? I I don't think so, but he seems

762
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,080
Speaker 10:  to think it is.

763
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,960
Speaker 9:  It doesn't sound simpler, does it? Like is

764
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,880
Speaker 2:  That even anything?

765
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,920
Speaker 10:  Well he's saying like they're gonna com and you write about this on the

766
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,440
Speaker 10:  side all the time. Liz like he's saying they're gonna compete like so much

767
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,800
Speaker 10:  goes back to interest rates and he's saying we're gonna focus on better

768
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,760
Speaker 10:  interest rates on the positive and negative end so that we're the compelling

769
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,520
Speaker 10:  place to store your money. Can he actually do that? I don't think so.

770
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,880
Speaker 9:  Well You know, there have been a number of people who have been trying, most

771
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,600
Speaker 9:  notably Goldman, which has been offering a product both with Apple

772
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:02,720
Speaker 9:  and also on its own. It's just a savings account. You can't, like there's

773
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,520
Speaker 9:  no debit, you can't withdraw, it's all electronic so you have to

774
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,480
Speaker 9:  withdraw to another bank account in order to get cash out. But the idea of

775
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,120
Speaker 9:  like high interest savings accounts, like those are not especially new either.

776
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,440
Speaker 9:  And it's something that we've seen a lot of banking institutions move into

777
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:21,920
Speaker 9:  with mixed results. So You know, I I I understand wanting to

778
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,040
Speaker 9:  compete on interest rates, but the other thing that I'm gonna say is that

779
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,880
Speaker 9:  like, I think about this stuff on a pretty regular basis and I

780
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,960
Speaker 9:  don't pretend to to be an expert You know, I certainly don't have an econ

781
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,120
Speaker 9:  degree or anything like that. But I do, I am interested and I talk about

782
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,080
Speaker 9:  interest rates with You know friends and family and they don't

783
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,880
Speaker 9:  understand them. Yeah, they don't think about them. And so like

784
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,640
Speaker 9:  if you are offering a consumer product as many

785
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,520
Speaker 9:  institutions, by the way do, it needs to be simple enough to be understood

786
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,960
Speaker 9:  by most consumers because I, I do remember during the era of low interest

787
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,800
Speaker 9:  rates, I had people who were telling me to get certificates of deposit, which

788
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,600
Speaker 9:  didn't make any sense given You know that the interest rate was almost nothing

789
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,960
Speaker 9:  and I would've been earning less on a CD than I was losing an inflation.

790
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,400
Speaker 9:  So there are like, there just seems to be like a, a basic lack of

791
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,280
Speaker 9:  I would say financial literacy that would preclude

792
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:17,200
Speaker 9:  something like that making intuitive sense to a consumer. So that's

793
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,840
Speaker 9:  problem one. Problem two is that it sounds pretty complex.

794
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,280
Speaker 9:  So if he's saying You know if your balance is positive, you, you get a better

795
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,000
Speaker 9:  interest rate and if your balance is negative, you get a worse interest rate.

796
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:31,160
Speaker 9:  That's a lot more complexity than just having one fixed interest rate

797
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,040
Speaker 9:  that you can sort of rely on and do math around. So it sounds

798
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,960
Speaker 9:  like he has some ideas that don't translate

799
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:43,160
Speaker 9:  easily to a consumer audience. And if you're

800
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,440
Speaker 9:  thinking about a, a super app, if you're thinking about some of these, these

801
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,360
Speaker 9:  kinds of payment apps like, like Venmo or PayPal, which mostly make money

802
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,200
Speaker 9:  on the float, what you're thinking about is a consumer audience. What you're

803
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,680
Speaker 9:  thinking about is people need to transact without thinking too hard. They

804
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,480
Speaker 9:  need to You know they go out to dinner or one person pays the bill and everybody

805
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,640
Speaker 9:  else sends them You know some amount of money for the bill. That's what they're

806
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,880
Speaker 9:  thinking about. And so You know in that sense, like maybe social media

807
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,680
Speaker 9:  can be useful because You know you have your connections with friends. But

808
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,520
Speaker 9:  I also think about the people who I talk to online most often and they're

809
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,200
Speaker 9:  not the same people I see in everyday life and You know

810
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,840
Speaker 9:  with all, all love to my internet friends like David and Alex

811
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,320
Speaker 9:  'cause we don't live in the same cities. You know the people who I'm going

812
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,720
Speaker 9:  to be sending payments to because we split dinner are not the same people

813
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,800
Speaker 9:  as the people who I'm talking to on Twitter all day.

814
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,840
Speaker 10:  You're saying your friends at dinner are, they're not all on X all the time.

815
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:34,560
Speaker 10:  No.

816
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,640
Speaker 9:  It turns out that I have a bunch of friends who like have jobs that mean

817
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,280
Speaker 9:  that they're not on the internet all day.

818
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,640
Speaker 2:  I genuinely don't even know what that means. That doesn't, that does not,

819
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:46,920
Speaker 2:  that doesn't track to me at all. But I just wanna say one more thing about

820
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,760
Speaker 2:  the consumer business side of this, like this has also not

821
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:54,360
Speaker 2:  been a good business. It turns out that like, like to your point about the

822
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,160
Speaker 2:  Apple Goldman Sachs thing, like Goldman Sachs is by all accounts trying

823
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,800
Speaker 2:  desperately to get out of that business because providing simple,

824
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:05,880
Speaker 2:  understandable ways for people to make sure they pay their credit card bills

825
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,080
Speaker 2:  actually turns out to be a really crappy business. And when you're Apple,

826
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,080
Speaker 2:  that's all fine and good and I get a notification every month telling me

827
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,120
Speaker 2:  to pay my Apple card. Turns out that's not making Goldman Sachs any money,

828
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:19,360
Speaker 2:  which is a real bummer for Goldman Sachs. So yet again, this is the kind

829
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,240
Speaker 2:  of thing that seems like it ought to be a good business because you get to

830
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,320
Speaker 2:  be in the middle of people moving their money around between each other and

831
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,600
Speaker 2:  it just might not be.

832
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:31,440
Speaker 10:  I'll play devil's advocate just for one second for Musk please. Okay. You

833
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,400
Speaker 10:  know how many apps people download per month on average? Take a wild guess.

834
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:36,720
Speaker 10:  Zero. Zero. Yeah,

835
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,440
Speaker 2:  Zero. Yeah. So this is the case for the super app? Yeah. Yeah, that's the

836
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:39,840
Speaker 2:  whole thing.

837
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:43,920
Speaker 10:  So You know if you're in the US though, the apps on your phone

838
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,160
Speaker 10:  already do all the things he's trying to build. So that's obviously the

839
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,200
Speaker 10:  thing that wouldn't support his vision here. But he's got one of the last

840
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,200
Speaker 10:  scaled You know social media platforms with You know

841
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,840
Speaker 10:  hundreds of millions of monthly users at least. At least some portion of

842
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,840
Speaker 10:  those are real users. We're not sure how many, but it's got its sizable

843
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,880
Speaker 10:  You know user base of real people. We think there is something to be said

844
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,640
Speaker 10:  for like make it a stickier product for the people who are using it. You

845
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,120
Speaker 10:  can see kind of him putting the pieces together with the creator payments

846
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,760
Speaker 10:  that they've started doing, right? So if you're verified, you're starting

847
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,480
Speaker 10:  to get like, I think it's actually now bi-monthly just payments

848
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,280
Speaker 10:  to your Stripe account. I think it's deeply funny by the way that

849
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,320
Speaker 10:  he's using Stripe for all this right now. Like he, they're building it all

850
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,400
Speaker 10:  on the fly. They have none of this like in-house yet. So he is using Stripe.

851
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,800
Speaker 10:  But yeah, You know, say you're a creator, you're getting these payments

852
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,760
Speaker 10:  which are basically some undescribed rev share of the ads that run against

853
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,280
Speaker 10:  your tweet after certain million plus impressions that

854
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,040
Speaker 10:  balance. What if that just starts earning interest for you in your X account?

855
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,000
Speaker 10:  And that's, that feeds into the, the money that you can send through the

856
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,920
Speaker 10:  system. And he's talked in in internal all hands about You know we have

857
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,320
Speaker 10:  to be backwards compatible with the existing financial system so

858
00:51:56,470 --> 00:52:00,160
Speaker 10:  they're going to have credit cards and debit cards for x as wild You know

859
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,080
Speaker 10:  as wild as that says, as wild as that sounds, that's

860
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,880
Speaker 10:  gonna happen. He's gonna offer lending so it's gonna become

861
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,120
Speaker 10:  this full kind of bank thing. And he's been wanting to do it forever and

862
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,960
Speaker 10:  it's just kind of, it's remarkable that it's like so similar to the

863
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:18,600
Speaker 10:  early vision, like the late nineties vision that Liz started this

864
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,520
Speaker 10:  conversation talking about. And he seems to just not

865
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:26,160
Speaker 10:  care that the world has changed and think that I've got a big enough user

866
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,040
Speaker 10:  base that I can make something interesting here and T B D

867
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,200
Speaker 10:  if that will work. But that's, that's what he's doing.

868
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,360
Speaker 2:  You also just perfectly described why I think the super app

869
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:40,360
Speaker 2:  discussion is so fascinating because it just makes

870
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,600
Speaker 2:  logical sense every single time, right? No matter which company you are,

871
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,480
Speaker 2:  whether you're, you make You know WhatsApp or Snap or Uber

872
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:50,240
Speaker 2:  which is kind of trying to do this or any number of other companies, it's

873
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,760
Speaker 2:  like okay well we have this one core competency. People are spending their

874
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,560
Speaker 2:  time inside of our app doing a thing. What if we do this like slightly adjacent

875
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,920
Speaker 2:  thing and then if that starts to work, what if we do this other slightly

876
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,880
Speaker 2:  adjacent thing and over and over and over, you can talk yourself into

877
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:08,000
Speaker 2:  every company has to be some kind of like financial juggernaut

878
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,280
Speaker 2:  because that's what powers a lot of the rest of this. And then you talk yourself

879
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,160
Speaker 2:  into not only do we want to be a social media app, we also want to

880
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,400
Speaker 2:  be a chat app and Then we have to do some entertainment stuff but then people

881
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,960
Speaker 2:  are gonna wanna like get around So, we should probably be a rideshare company.

882
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:24,600
Speaker 2:  And it's like you can talk yourself into trying to be all things to all people,

883
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:28,800
Speaker 2:  which is a terrible idea in perfectly rational way as one step at a time.

884
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,280
Speaker 2:  And I feel like we've watched these companies do this for like 15 years and

885
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,760
Speaker 2:  it's so funny and so bizarre every single time. And now we're just watching

886
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:39,080
Speaker 2:  Elon Musk do the same thing but at like record speed

887
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,240
Speaker 9:  You know David, I also wanna just point out something 'cause we've, we've

888
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,640
Speaker 9:  been dancing around interest rates for a minute. I understand, I sound like

889
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,760
Speaker 9:  a broken record, but post 2008

890
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:54,320
Speaker 9:  there was a very long period of very low interest rates and that

891
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,840
Speaker 9:  was part of the reason why we wound up with people trying to do blitz scaling.

892
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:01,640
Speaker 9:  It was part of the reason why we found people You know moving into

893
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:05,440
Speaker 9:  related businesses that didn't totally always make sense.

894
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,920
Speaker 2:  We work opening a preschool will forever be my favorite example of that.

895
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:12,840
Speaker 9:  That's right. And so You know, if you think about it in a way

896
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,840
Speaker 9:  it was easier to experiment with this kind of thing because there weren't

897
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,200
Speaker 9:  a lot of places to park money that would earn you

898
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,960
Speaker 9:  interest. And so that meant that there was a lot more money available for

899
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,640
Speaker 9:  investing. And if you think about what's been going on over the last

900
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,520
Speaker 9:  two-ish years, the Fed has been raising interest rates. And so that is

901
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:36,440
Speaker 9:  no longer true separately from the fact that You know the yields on

902
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,320
Speaker 9:  bonds are pretty high right now, relatively high. There's also

903
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:44,480
Speaker 9:  just a, a variety of financial instruments that have suddenly become much

904
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,080
Speaker 9:  more attractive than they've been for about a decade. And that's a problem

905
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:51,480
Speaker 9:  for VCs generally because all of that VC scaling

906
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:55,720
Speaker 9:  like Blitzscaling stuff, You know typified for instance by Uber

907
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:59,960
Speaker 9:  that relied on there being a lot of cash available so that you could pour

908
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,800
Speaker 9:  it all into the market corner, the market and then You know jack up the prices,

909
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:07,640
Speaker 9:  which is essentially what Uber has done. Again, we may not be in conditions

910
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,360
Speaker 9:  for that to continue to occur anymore. And one of the things that has been

911
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,440
Speaker 9:  a real question for me when it comes to Elon Musk and it's an

912
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,080
Speaker 9:  open question, is that a lot of his success happened in this low interest

913
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,120
Speaker 9:  rate era. A lot of You know what we think of as being

914
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:26,600
Speaker 9:  Tesla's success for instance happened when it was easy to get

915
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,200
Speaker 9:  ahold of money and even then Tesla almost went outta business a couple times.

916
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:34,480
Speaker 9:  You think about SpaceX, You know it's still private, it's

917
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:38,400
Speaker 9:  very much venture backed and it's a valuable company. You know it does a

918
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,200
Speaker 9:  lot of important things for the US government. I don't mean to suggest that

919
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,920
Speaker 9:  it's You know smoke and mirrors or anything like that, but again, conditions

920
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,360
Speaker 9:  have changed. You think about some of the other projects that Musk has been

921
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,040
Speaker 9:  working on, the sort of more farfetched stuff like the boring company in

922
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:55,920
Speaker 9:  Neuralink and you wonder how far they're gonna go in this new

923
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,640
Speaker 9:  environment. And you think about Twitter, which You know

924
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:04,440
Speaker 9:  Twitter has never been an especially successful business. True

925
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,680
Speaker 9:  even though it's been a particularly influential one. And

926
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,400
Speaker 9:  you think about all of the debt that Musk loaded it up with in order to buy

927
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,320
Speaker 9:  it. And you think about the new environment we're in, which we

928
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,200
Speaker 9:  haven't seen You know in quite some time. And you just wonder

929
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,920
Speaker 9:  if Elon Musk is prepared for this era of

930
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,440
Speaker 9:  normal interest rates. Like there just seems like a lot of the things that

931
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,400
Speaker 9:  he has done has been to spend as much money as possible and worry about the

932
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,480
Speaker 9:  risk later. And I'm kind of wondering if it's, if we've reached the moment

933
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,760
Speaker 9:  where it's later and you should be worrying. Yeah.

934
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:39,160
Speaker 2:  Alex, what have you heard from folks over the last couple of years? 'cause

935
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,920
Speaker 2:  I think like I, I Liz I agree with you almost a hundred

936
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,800
Speaker 2:  percent, but also the other thing that is happening is that all these companies

937
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:49,400
Speaker 2:  tried this when there was unlimited money to throw at it and it kept not

938
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,960
Speaker 2:  working still, right? Like Facebook couldn't make dating

939
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:56,920
Speaker 2:  happen and all these companies have tried to expand into this like do

940
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,720
Speaker 2:  more things with your life outside of just these sort of

941
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,920
Speaker 2:  core competency of our app. But Alex, I'm curious what you've seen like have

942
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,800
Speaker 2:  folks pulled back on this ambition because of sort of the the

943
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,920
Speaker 2:  like larger economic changes here that we're talking about

944
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:14,160
Speaker 10:  From a product perspective? No, I actually wrote a piece in The Verge

945
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,760
Speaker 10:  2021 predicting that there were gonna be more of these super apps

946
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:22,200
Speaker 10:  attempts around the world. I wasn't specifically talking about the US

947
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,640
Speaker 10:  but just broadly for a number of reasons. But because

948
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,920
Speaker 10:  a lot of the kind of scaled big

949
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,760
Speaker 10:  independent apps that do one or two things, like they worked as a

950
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,840
Speaker 10:  business in a model where you could track people across the

951
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,760
Speaker 10:  internet and that increasingly is not happening anymore thanks to Apple

952
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,400
Speaker 10:  and regulation. And so you have this incentive for all of these

953
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,440
Speaker 10:  companies that make money by how much time people spend in their services

954
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,360
Speaker 10:  to bring more of that activity inside

955
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:57,280
Speaker 10:  their walled garden so to speak. So you have like TikTok

956
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:01,240
Speaker 10:  doing shopping right, where you can like buy a a a

957
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,920
Speaker 10:  thing you see in a video without ever leaving TikTok that wouldn't have

958
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,440
Speaker 10:  happened five years ago because you didn't need to because you could still

959
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,840
Speaker 10:  track who made the purchase where if they went somewhere else it just wasn't

960
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,640
Speaker 10:  worth the effort. So I do think there's a natural kind of business

961
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:19,120
Speaker 10:  incentive at play here for all of these kind of time spent based

962
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,400
Speaker 10:  companies to become more like super apps. And the TikTok shopping

963
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,160
Speaker 10:  thing is actually a great kind of very, very fresh example. They're

964
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,920
Speaker 10:  testing like a storefront that looks like Amazon right next to the video

965
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:34,800
Speaker 10:  feed and TikTok. So to Liz's point about You know

966
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:38,920
Speaker 10:  the broader kind of macroeconomic climate here and the fact that

967
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:42,880
Speaker 10:  it is You know capital is more expensive. You can't just like You know Tesla's

968
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,720
Speaker 10:  not gonna become a trillion dollar company on pure mania

969
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,760
Speaker 10:  anymore, right? Like that era has passed. That's

970
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,520
Speaker 2:  Definitely true. Yeah,

971
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:53,800
Speaker 10:  Sure. But like, I mean from everything Musk has been saying since he bought

972
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,520
Speaker 10:  Twitter, he seems to be painfully aware that things are changing.

973
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:01,320
Speaker 10:  Like every time he talks to people internally it's like we have got to prepare

974
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,200
Speaker 10:  for a recession. You know I reported on meetings like when he first bought

975
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,920
Speaker 10:  the company where he was talking about the fact that he thinks of very bad

976
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,880
Speaker 10:  recession is coming. Looks like that may not be the case now, but he's

977
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,520
Speaker 10:  definitely been thinking You know things are shifting. I don't think he's

978
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,080
Speaker 10:  totally oblivious to it. I mean he is, he is the richest person in the world.

979
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:23,040
Speaker 10:  Like I, I think he probably has pretty good data, he's very focused on cutting

980
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:26,760
Speaker 10:  costs on You know. I think SpaceX just had its first

981
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:30,880
Speaker 10:  profitable quarter I just saw in a media story in in like Q one.

982
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,320
Speaker 10:  So he is actually kind of like leading the charge so to speak in Silicon

983
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,920
Speaker 10:  Valley of like cutting companies down to the bone to try to make them profitable

984
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,880
Speaker 10:  and get away from this kind of hypergrowth era. So I don't know,

985
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,040
Speaker 10:  I don't know if the things are, I don't know if that's, that means that

986
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:50,240
Speaker 10:  he's gonna succeed here. But I do think he seems to be at least aware that

987
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:50,800
Speaker 10:  things are changing.

988
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:55,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I do think to go back to WeChat for a second, one of the things WeChat

989
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,680
Speaker 2:  was able to do that worked so well was essentially just

990
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:03,200
Speaker 2:  pour money and energy and effort into getting people into the app.

991
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,800
Speaker 2:  Like Liz what you were talking about with the early days of PayPal where

992
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,000
Speaker 2:  they're essentially just heaving money at people to use PayPal

993
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:13,240
Speaker 2:  or x.com or whatever the heck it was. WeChat was able to do that kind of

994
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:17,080
Speaker 2:  thing for a long time and just work so hard and grow

995
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:20,840
Speaker 2:  so much that it kind of had won the market before

996
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,360
Speaker 2:  anybody really noticed. And then you get into that sort of escape

997
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:28,640
Speaker 2:  velocity and it becomes very hard to lose because people decide it's smarter

998
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:31,480
Speaker 2:  to just build inside of WeChat than build their own thing because they don't

999
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,840
Speaker 2:  have the money to compute with it and like on and on and that's who you win.

1000
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,640
Speaker 2:  And that in this era becomes much harder to do, right? Because there's no

1001
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,920
Speaker 2:  free money to just throw it growing

1002
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:44,040
Speaker 10:  David, it becomes easier to win when you have the full backing of the ccp.

1003
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,880
Speaker 10:  I mean like that's sure that's to get to our early point like and, and

1004
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:50,760
Speaker 10:  this can maybe kind of bring it full circle a little bit like to what Liz

1005
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,480
Speaker 10:  was talking about earlier. Like do we really want Elon Musk who

1006
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,280
Speaker 10:  already has a ton of power, especially through like starlink and

1007
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:02,320
Speaker 10:  how that relates to how physical wars are playing out in in Ukraine.

1008
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,880
Speaker 10:  Do we really want someone with all these different businesses in power to

1009
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,800
Speaker 10:  have something like a WeChat and he has a business in

1010
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:14,280
Speaker 10:  China that is very important strategically to Tesla.

1011
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:18,560
Speaker 10:  He's got a lot of pressure points that can be pushed

1012
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,160
Speaker 10:  around the world by different governments and do we want something like

1013
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,840
Speaker 10:  a super app where we transact and do all these things to be managed by

1014
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:31,080
Speaker 10:  one person who let's be clear controls his company's companies

1015
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:35,000
Speaker 10:  completely, right? So it's like this isn't like a, a

1016
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,160
Speaker 10:  normal governance situation. So there's there's a lot to be concerned about

1017
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:38,320
Speaker 10:  there.

1018
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,360
Speaker 2:  Liz, I have a strange feeling. I know your answer to Alex's question.

1019
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:45,840
Speaker 9:  There are a lot of reasons I don't want Elon

1020
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:49,400
Speaker 9:  Musk's super app managing my money

1021
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:54,400
Speaker 9:  and all of the things that you guys have have mentioned are are part

1022
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,160
Speaker 9:  of it. Part of it is also You know I'm a reporter who

1023
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,080
Speaker 9:  reports on Elon Musk and like, do I necessarily want him to be able

1024
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,920
Speaker 9:  to like look into my bank account from God view?

1025
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:07,200
Speaker 9:  Do I

1026
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,080
Speaker 2:  I feel like it is though. Like you, you like you a little bit just like root

1027
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,240
Speaker 2:  for chaos at all times and like that is chaos.

1028
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:17,440
Speaker 9:  It's true. And like honestly I, he's gonna find out that I spend

1029
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,440
Speaker 9:  far too much money on my cat

1030
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,920
Speaker 9:  but You know like as you think about these things, the other thing to think

1031
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,600
Speaker 9:  about is Elon Musk's history of implementation and it's sloppy

1032
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:31,280
Speaker 9:  and You know the, some of that is like the panel problems that we saw with

1033
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,760
Speaker 9:  with Tesla You know and and various other sort of implementation

1034
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,560
Speaker 9:  problems. But even if you just narrow your

1035
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,000
Speaker 9:  focus to Twitter slash x, there's just been a lot of

1036
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,880
Speaker 9:  sloppiness there from the X sign to not getting the X

1037
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,760
Speaker 9:  handle until after the name had already been changed

1038
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:53,680
Speaker 9:  to the various sort of problems that we've had around

1039
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:58,080
Speaker 9:  the service where we were being rate limited abruptly for a

1040
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,800
Speaker 9:  while. And like this kind of like slap dash

1041
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:05,680
Speaker 9:  mentality is an old Silicon Valley mentality, it's You know

1042
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,200
Speaker 9:  usually thought of as like move fast and break things. And that does make

1043
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,840
Speaker 9:  sense in certain contexts. You know like the Twitter fail

1044
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:16,800
Speaker 9:  fail whale was a thing because, because sometimes the

1045
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,320
Speaker 9:  service went out 'cause there were too many people on it. But You know I

1046
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,040
Speaker 9:  if you think about the things that you don't want from banks, I'm just gonna

1047
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,320
Speaker 9:  list some of them. Abrupt, frequent service changes,

1048
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,680
Speaker 9:  regular service outages, new fees added at random

1049
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:34,560
Speaker 9:  white supremacists, difficulty with verification, spam and

1050
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,840
Speaker 9:  fraud. You know, like these are all things I don't want any anywhere near

1051
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,640
Speaker 9:  my money. Yeah. And if you just look at how Twitter is operating right

1052
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,600
Speaker 9:  now and you think about it is like, hmm,

1053
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:48,960
Speaker 9:  do I trust Elon Musk to to to actually handle my money in a way that makes

1054
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,720
Speaker 9:  sense, right?

1055
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:53,560
Speaker 10:  It's like all these crypto scam ads that I see in my feed every day, it's

1056
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,120
Speaker 10:  like, oh, all I want is to be able to actually send money to those ads,

1057
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:57,920
Speaker 10:  right?

1058
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:01,000
Speaker 2:  With one click. They just have your bank account now. That's what everybody's

1059
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,600
Speaker 2:  looking for, right?

1060
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:02,000
Speaker 10:  Yeah.

1061
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:06,560
Speaker 2:  So, okay, last thing and Then we should go is I, I think if you imagine

1062
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,240
Speaker 2:  somebody Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg or somebody from a product

1063
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:15,000
Speaker 2:  perspective manages to build this thing, they they accrue

1064
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:19,080
Speaker 2:  all of the value, all of the user data, all the everything to

1065
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,920
Speaker 2:  like be the the WeChat of America.

1066
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:26,720
Speaker 2:  Could anyone pull that off from a regulatory standpoint? Like would would

1067
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:30,640
Speaker 2:  Lean Con in the F T C just throw their bodies in front of one

1068
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,240
Speaker 2:  company having this much, this is an argument I've heard and I genuinely

1069
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:38,240
Speaker 2:  don't know where I'd land on. Like could you even in theory pull

1070
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,600
Speaker 2:  this off under the US government's nose?

1071
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:44,640
Speaker 10:  No there's no chance. I mean Facebook, are we old

1072
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:48,560
Speaker 10:  enough now to where we don't remember in just 2019

1073
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,920
Speaker 10:  Facebook tried to create a global currency.

1074
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:52,400
Speaker 2:  Libra

1075
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:55,520
Speaker 9:  Like I remember Libra, I love Libra.

1076
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:59,840
Speaker 10:  Yeah. And honestly Libra was a pretty smart idea for a

1077
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,040
Speaker 10:  global currency that had a lot of benefits and was gonna be managed by a

1078
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,840
Speaker 10:  trust et cetera. Like they thought through a lot of the potential blowback,

1079
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:10,440
Speaker 10:  guess what they, it still got shut down. I would say there's next to zero

1080
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:14,360
Speaker 10:  chance that anything like this happens in the US for all

1081
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,800
Speaker 10:  the reasons you just said David. I mean if Facebook can't buy

1082
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,360
Speaker 10:  Giphy, do you really think like that Congress,

1083
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,560
Speaker 10:  especially all the members of Congress who have strong feelings about Musk

1084
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,880
Speaker 10:  already are gonna let him build a financial superpower that potentially,

1085
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:31,960
Speaker 10:  potentially like has more power than the US government? No. Like no,

1086
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,080
Speaker 10:  absolutely not. I

1087
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:36,960
Speaker 9:  Wanna pile onto this because it isn't just an antitrust

1088
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:40,560
Speaker 9:  issue, although it's a very sexy antitrust issue.

1089
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:43,840
Speaker 9:  What you're talking about is essentially somebody who's managing the digital

1090
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,480
Speaker 9:  dollar and I feel like the Fed and the Treasury both wanna be involved with

1091
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,320
Speaker 9:  that. And so not only are you looking at an antitrust issue, you're looking

1092
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,760
Speaker 9:  at dealing with other major government agencies

1093
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,440
Speaker 9:  and You know there are people out there. Circle is one of them that are interested

1094
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,720
Speaker 9:  in being the purveyor of the digital dollar that are interested in doing

1095
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,400
Speaker 9:  that kind of work that have talked publicly about wanting to work with

1096
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:09,840
Speaker 9:  the Fed, with the treasury to to have a digital dollar.

1097
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:14,320
Speaker 9:  And that's a very, very different proposition than what we're hearing about

1098
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:18,320
Speaker 9:  with these super apps. And like again, if you go back to something like Fed

1099
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,400
Speaker 9:  now, there is like a reality where it turns out

1100
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,600
Speaker 9:  like maybe your competition is the United States

1101
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:29,880
Speaker 9:  because it turns out the dollar is a really, really important part

1102
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:33,720
Speaker 9:  of why the US is so powerful. The dollar is something that a lot of people

1103
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:37,440
Speaker 9:  transact in around the world. It's a really, really important part of the

1104
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,680
Speaker 9:  US' soft power and wherever the dollar goes, US law goes as

1105
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,520
Speaker 9:  well. So whenever you're talking about this kind of like super app

1106
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:49,240
Speaker 9:  when you're talking about these kinds of big payment companies, you are inevitably

1107
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:53,520
Speaker 9:  also talking about something much more powerful. And Elon,

1108
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,720
Speaker 9:  Musk already has a lot of sway in the federal government because his You

1109
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,160
Speaker 9:  know starlink is very important because he sends

1110
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:05,280
Speaker 9:  a lot of satellites up for various US military missions.

1111
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:09,280
Speaker 9:  And so there is like this question of how much more power

1112
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:13,840
Speaker 9:  we as You know the United States want to hand over to him.

1113
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,800
Speaker 9:  Like he's already like doing all of these things for the military. Do you

1114
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,560
Speaker 9:  want him handling the US dollar as well? And I feel like the answer is probably

1115
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:20,880
Speaker 9:  not.

1116
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:24,880
Speaker 2:  It's a real, like no one man should have all that power kind of situation.

1117
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:28,480
Speaker 2:  It's it's just where I land. Yeah, I, I don't know. I kind of hope

1118
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,520
Speaker 2:  somebody gets further down this road and we can actually have this fight

1119
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,880
Speaker 2:  in a real way. 'cause I think Meta never had a chance because of all the

1120
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,800
Speaker 2:  other stuff going on with meta. The F T C was just like the whole US government

1121
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,160
Speaker 2:  would've stopped Libra if it came to it. I don't think Elon Musk is

1122
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:47,240
Speaker 2:  gonna to even get close, but it's, it's gonna be fascinating to see if someone

1123
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:50,680
Speaker 2:  can get well enough down the road that we actually have to have this fight

1124
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,560
Speaker 2:  for real. But I'm not convinced forever gonna see it. Alex who would you

1125
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,280
Speaker 2:  bet on? Do you still think it's Snap could snap do it?

1126
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:59,160
Speaker 10:  No, I, I don't think this is happening and not, not in the US I do think

1127
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,840
Speaker 10:  it will happen in other parts of the world where countries are kind of more

1128
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:06,600
Speaker 10:  willing to embrace something like this. But I think the US is so

1129
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:10,960
Speaker 10:  against big tech right now and there's so many established players

1130
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:14,840
Speaker 10:  doing things really well at scale like banking that I just don't see how

1131
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,560
Speaker 10:  this happens. But You know could be my famous last words.

1132
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:21,960
Speaker 2:  No, I tend to agree. I think instead of a super app we got like the whole

1133
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,200
Speaker 2:  internet and I think that's probably a better trade

1134
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,680
Speaker 10:  And like that's okay. Like it's actually yeah, I love it's capitalism. Like

1135
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,360
Speaker 10:  I free market whatever. Like I, I love having apps competing for my,

1136
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:35,680
Speaker 10:  my services and my attention and to have options is a good thing.

1137
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:39,440
Speaker 10:  Like we shouldn't be like necessarily wanting one company doing everything.

1138
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:40,080
Speaker 10:  Totally.

1139
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:43,600
Speaker 2:  Alright, well we gotta take a break. But thank you both for, for doing this.

1140
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,920
Speaker 2:  I appreciate it and I will, I will ex both of you some money for being here.

1141
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:47,440
Speaker 2:  Thank you.

1142
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,000
Speaker 10:  No you won't. All right. See you guys.

1143
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:50,200
Speaker 1:  Bye.

1144

1164
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,850
Speaker 2:  This week's voicemail comes from Daniel.

1165
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:32,010
Speaker 12:  Hey, this is Daniel. I always have this question of why

1166
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:36,090
Speaker 12:  social media doesn't recognize the fact that like people

1167
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:39,770
Speaker 12:  are more than just one thing. Like why can't I

1168
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,730
Speaker 12:  have a whole collection of subreddits for each of my like quote

1169
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:47,770
Speaker 12:  unquote modes. Like sometimes I'm in productivity mode where I

1170
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:50,810
Speaker 12:  just wanna see You know how to be optimally product

1171
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:55,170
Speaker 12:  productive I guess, and do spreadsheets and that kind of

1172
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:58,530
Speaker 12:  stuff. And then sometimes I'm into my hobby interest mode and I just wanna

1173
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:02,130
Speaker 12:  see stuff about like video games or whatever. The only way I've ever found

1174
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:05,690
Speaker 12:  to do this is to actually have totally separate social media

1175
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:09,650
Speaker 12:  profiles, which is just super annoying to maintain. But why

1176
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:13,010
Speaker 12:  doesn't any social media recognize that that's a thing that pretty much,

1177
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,560
Speaker 12:  much every person has. Anyway, tell me your thoughts. Bye.

1178
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:21,240
Speaker 2:  Okay, I have answers to this question for once. I have a, I have a small

1179
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,800
Speaker 2:  thought and a big thought. The small thought is that for Reddit, this is

1180
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,640
Speaker 2:  actually a thing you can do Reddit sort of berries this, but it does actually

1181
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,240
Speaker 2:  exist. It used to be called Multi Reddits and now it's called custom

1182
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:36,440
Speaker 2:  feeds. And basically the idea is you can pull a bunch of different

1183
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:40,440
Speaker 2:  subreddits into one thing that you see all as

1184
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,800
Speaker 2:  a single Reddit timeline. So like I have one ironically for

1185
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,000
Speaker 2:  productivity, that's all of my like productivity nerds, subreddits. And then

1186
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,520
Speaker 2:  I have one for all the sports teams I care about. So like I have the

1187
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:53,960
Speaker 2:  Arsenal subreddit, New York Giants Subreddit and the Yankees subreddit all

1188
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,760
Speaker 2:  in one place. This is a great thing that Reddit does. I don't know why

1189
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,800
Speaker 2:  they don't share it more. It's kind of awkward to find, I'll put a link in

1190
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,600
Speaker 2:  the show notes on how to set up a custom feed on the web and in the apps.

1191
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:08,760
Speaker 2:  But it is possible and you should do it and it's great. The bigger picture

1192
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,240
Speaker 2:  thing here is I think this is a good idea and I think we're gonna get

1193
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:16,040
Speaker 2:  towards it. I think one of the things we've talked about a lot with the social

1194
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:19,920
Speaker 2:  web and activity pub is this idea that there are going to be lots of

1195
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:23,920
Speaker 2:  new ways to sort and filter and display the same kinds

1196
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,840
Speaker 2:  of content. So you've heard Elon, Musk and others talk about this idea of

1197
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,600
Speaker 2:  like open sourcing the algorithm so that you can get different versions

1198
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:35,040
Speaker 2:  of the same experience depending on what you want. So you could show up and

1199
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,760
Speaker 2:  say I'm in the mood to just go on TikTok and watch bloopers

1200
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,200
Speaker 2:  from TV shows that I like. And that's actually an instruction. You might

1201
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:46,080
Speaker 2:  be able to give an app like that over time or to say I'm in work

1202
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,960
Speaker 2:  mode or I'm in school mode or whatever and actually have these

1203
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,800
Speaker 2:  things work separately. It's hard work and it means having

1204
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:57,760
Speaker 2:  different algorithms and systems and it also means making users do

1205
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:01,360
Speaker 2:  more, which most of these apps don't like to do. But I do think that's actually

1206
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:05,200
Speaker 2:  a place that we're headed with some of these tools. The other thing is that

1207
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,200
Speaker 2:  I wouldn't underrate how useful it is to have multiple accounts because the

1208
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,600
Speaker 2:  other thing is when you're interacting on these, when you're liking stuff

1209
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,720
Speaker 2:  and you're commenting and you're posting, having all of that stuff kind of

1210
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:19,720
Speaker 2:  live together in a separate account works really well. So even if we get

1211
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:23,680
Speaker 2:  to the point where you can customize your algorithms or like I have custom

1212
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:27,840
Speaker 2:  feeds on Reddit, I'm still posting as me and so kind of

1213
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:31,520
Speaker 2:  my interactions in my life all live in the same place.

1214
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:35,080
Speaker 2:  And a lot of these companies, Instagram I think does this better than almost

1215
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,040
Speaker 2:  anybody make it really easy to switch from account to account. But I'm a

1216
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,120
Speaker 2:  big fan of having multiple accounts. I have lots of accounts on lots of different

1217
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:45,240
Speaker 2:  services and it occasionally gets like awkwardly cross pollinated 'cause

1218
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,640
Speaker 2:  you forget what you're logged into. But having a Reddit that I go to when

1219
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:52,560
Speaker 2:  I'm just looking for sports stuff and wanna like yell about

1220
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,120
Speaker 2:  sports that is separate from where I comment as like a person who people

1221
01:13:56,270 --> 01:14:00,160
Speaker 2:  know on the internet is really useful. And if you wanna shit post, you should

1222
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,600
Speaker 2:  have an account just for shit Posting is my personal and professional opinion.

1223
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:08,000
Speaker 2:  So the point Daniel, is I think we're headed somewhat towards the

1224
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,040
Speaker 2:  world that you described, but also custom feeds on Reddit will instantly

1225
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:15,280
Speaker 2:  make your life better. I hope that helps. Alright, that is it for The
