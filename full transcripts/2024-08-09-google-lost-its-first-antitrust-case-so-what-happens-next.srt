Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, Alex Cranz, Alex Heath, and Lauren Feiner discuss a federal judge ruling that Google violated US antitrust law, X suing a group of major advertisers over an “illegal boycott”, and the rest of this week's wild tech news.

2
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:18,095
Speaker 5:  sue you because I I want money. And you said no. So

3
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:19,135
Speaker 5:  to court

4
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:23,495
Speaker 4:  It's a lot. It's a lot. We have an additional Alex Alex

5
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:24,815
Speaker 4:  Heath is here. Hi.

6
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:28,135
Speaker 6:  I am, I'm also not using Bing. You couldn't pay me to use it either.

7
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:32,775
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah, we could have, I want to be clear. We could have also been the flagship

8
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:36,575
Speaker 4:  podcast if you can't pay me to use Bing. Another thing we're gonna

9
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:40,495
Speaker 4:  spend a lot of time on today, it, it's a big week. Lauren Finer is

10
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:44,335
Speaker 4:  also here. Hey Lauren. Hello. There's a lot of news this week.

11
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:49,095
Speaker 4:  I thought it was gonna be a quiet week. We, we really thought it was

12
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:52,735
Speaker 4:  gonna be a quiet week. And then on Monday the court

13
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:57,015
Speaker 4:  released a gigantic ruling in the Google search antitrust case. Finding

14
00:01:57,015 --> 00:02:00,335
Speaker 4:  the Google search is a monopoly. We gotta talk all about that. The assistant

15
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:04,335
Speaker 4:  attorney general for antitrust, Jonathan Cantor was on decoder. We had just

16
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:06,975
Speaker 4:  a lot to say about that case. Lot to say about Apple in relation to that

17
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:09,695
Speaker 4:  case. Google was paying Apple for default placements. So we gotta spend time

18
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:12,935
Speaker 4:  in that. Then we're like, huh, all right, we know what's gonna happen this

19
00:02:12,935 --> 00:02:16,815
Speaker 4:  week. Then Elon Musk filed an x, filed a

20
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:20,575
Speaker 4:  lawsuit against advertisers claiming antitrust

21
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:24,495
Speaker 4:  violations because they refuse to advertise an XI would

22
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:28,375
Speaker 4:  say not is clear cut a victory for that case as maybe

23
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:32,255
Speaker 4:  in the Google search case. We gotta talk about that. We have a

24
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:34,375
Speaker 4:  lightning round. There's a bunch of stuff in light around talk about actually,

25
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:38,055
Speaker 4:  and then of course, Disney Plus is raising prices. A real, a real bird chest.

26
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:40,655
Speaker 4:  Oh, and I judged a TV competition, which I thought I was gonna get a chance

27
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:43,295
Speaker 4:  to write about, but didn't because everyone's suing each other. I read so

28
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,175
Speaker 4:  many PDFs this week.

29
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:47,055
Speaker 6:  Wait, you judged a TV competition?

30
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:51,335
Speaker 4:  Yeah, like the, the, the the 20th annual TV shootout.

31
00:02:51,925 --> 00:02:52,895
Speaker 4:  What? Yellow?

32
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,135
Speaker 5:  What was the actual TVs?

33
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:58,775
Speaker 4:  The actual TVs? We, they put, they put a bunch of OLEDs and micro LED TVs

34
00:02:58,775 --> 00:02:59,055
Speaker 4:  in a room.

35
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:04,125
Speaker 4:  And I went into that room with a bunch of like, like high-end

36
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,885
Speaker 4:  Hollywood colorists and compression engineers.

37
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:11,925
Speaker 4:  and it was, it was like all of them. And then me as the judge and

38
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,245
Speaker 4:  we, and we looked at the TVs. We had long worksheets to fill out as we watched

39
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:19,085
Speaker 4:  different, like scenes of movies. And then we like rated and I was gonna

40
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:23,005
Speaker 4:  write it. I was like, this was my week to finally let go of

41
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:26,725
Speaker 4:  talking about the government and talk about what I love instead, which is

42
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:30,485
Speaker 4:  how TVs look. And I didn't get to do a lick of it.

43
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:34,445
Speaker 4:  Wow. What did the frame TV rank? The frame TV was not, it did not make

44
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:36,205
Speaker 4:  it to the competition. What

45
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:39,085
Speaker 5:  Immediately like booted

46
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:42,885
Speaker 4:  It, it, it wasn't even in the mix. Like it didn't even get into the,

47
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:46,845
Speaker 4:  there were six TVs in the, in the finals and the, the frame was not among

48
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:47,005
Speaker 4:  them.

49
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:51,245
Speaker 4:  They're not really finals. They just picked the six effects TVs in the market.

50
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:54,525
Speaker 4:  And then I will tell you the two brands, we'll talk about it, but the two

51
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,405
Speaker 4:  brands specifically said, do not include us in this competition.

52
00:03:58,675 --> 00:03:59,645
Speaker 4:  Just looking to thank you.

53
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:03,805
Speaker 4:  We'll get to it and I'll talk about it and I promise I'll write about it

54
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:06,965
Speaker 4:  for next week. But that's what I thought I was gonna do this week. Like really

55
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:10,245
Speaker 4:  and truly, I thought I was gonna argue with people about whether micro led

56
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:14,325
Speaker 4:  ETS can compete with OLEDs. And I didn't do that because

57
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:17,885
Speaker 4:  our, our, the, the sheer number of PDFs generated by

58
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:20,605
Speaker 4:  the judicial branch of our government was out of control.

59
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:26,085
Speaker 4:  Like talk about a good time to buy a B Palmer. Just PS

60
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:29,645
Speaker 4:  days. Just forever. Alright, let's start with the Google searching.

61
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This case has been going on since what, 2020. It was filed under the

62
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:37,285
Speaker 4:  Trump administration in this sort of like classic Trump administration.

63
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:41,125
Speaker 4:  Like I dunno, let's sue Google. Like we're mad at them. But that

64
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,445
Speaker 5:  Was actually Biden, right? That that took it home.

65
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:46,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And then obviously the Biden administration with, with Le Kahn and,

66
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:49,045
Speaker 4:  and specifically Jonathan Canter at the Department of Justice who runs the

67
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:52,885
Speaker 4:  antitrust division. You know, Le Kahn is the chair of the FTC

68
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:56,245
Speaker 4:  Cantor runs the antitrust division at the d oj. They've been sort of like

69
00:04:57,085 --> 00:05:00,965
Speaker 4:  debating, AR arguing even who gets to take which antitrust

70
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:04,125
Speaker 4:  enforcement action and Google ended up at the doj. Lauren, you have some

71
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,285
Speaker 4:  color. Like even watching that, how do they decide who gets to do what?

72
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:12,285
Speaker 7:  Yeah, so generally how it breaks down is it's

73
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:16,325
Speaker 7:  somewhat based on just like the expertise of each agency. Like I think there's

74
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:20,085
Speaker 7:  certain industries that DOJ tends to take in certain

75
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:23,525
Speaker 7:  industries that FTC take tends to take. and it also,

76
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:27,685
Speaker 7:  maybe they'll consider like is this something where we might bring in the

77
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:30,805
Speaker 7:  FTC act, which obviously the FTC would use.

78
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:35,245
Speaker 7:  And maybe that feeds into the determination. But I think

79
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:38,885
Speaker 7:  generally it's just based on is this an industry that typically is A

80
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:40,565
Speaker 7:  DOJ or an FTC industry?

81
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:44,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So the DOJ had this one again started under the Trump administration.

82
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:48,765
Speaker 4:  The Biden, DOJ carried on with it. There was a trial, we covered

83
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:52,085
Speaker 4:  the hell outta the trial. Eddie Q was on the stand. Tim Cook was on the stand.

84
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:55,645
Speaker 4:  Nadella was on the stand talking about whether being could compete with Google.

85
00:05:56,585 --> 00:06:00,405
Speaker 5:  Was this the trial where they like just wouldn't let us see a lot of it.

86
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:01,405
Speaker 5:  It was a lot of it was closed

87
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:05,245
Speaker 7:  Off. Yes. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. There was a period where the

88
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:09,205
Speaker 7:  judge, I, I think it was a result of some of

89
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:12,685
Speaker 7:  the third parties in the cases that didn't want, you know, their business

90
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:16,565
Speaker 7:  information just aired out in front of the press and the public

91
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:21,045
Speaker 7:  kind of pushed for, you know, more behind closed

92
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:25,005
Speaker 7:  doors, elements of the trial. And the judge conceded to a lot of

93
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:27,845
Speaker 7:  that in the beginning. And then there was a lot of pushback from the press

94
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:30,965
Speaker 7:  and it became a bit more open. So yes, that was this trial.

95
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:35,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah, and it like the judge was like, well I believe Google when they say

96
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:39,005
Speaker 4:  these are trade secrets. And there was a lot of criticism. Lauren, from what

97
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:41,485
Speaker 4:  I understand, the judge took the criticism to heart. Like he was pretty stung

98
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:45,485
Speaker 4:  by it. And then he opened up and we got to cover more of it. We did, we did

99
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:48,205
Speaker 4:  cover the trial in an ongoing basis and then it was pretty quiet while he

100
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:52,125
Speaker 4:  was writing this opinion, which is 286 pages long.

101
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:52,885
Speaker 4:  He was writing a

102
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:53,045
Speaker 5:  Book.

103
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:55,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it it is a, it is a book about search.

104
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:59,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it was interesting 'cause I was just looking back at my stories from

105
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:03,725
Speaker 7:  the days of the closing arguments in May and I remember walking

106
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:07,605
Speaker 7:  away from that thinking like, you know, he kind of was holding his

107
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:11,605
Speaker 7:  cards close to the chest but you know, made a few

108
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,405
Speaker 7:  comments that seemed to dig at Google. But reading it back now having

109
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:19,205
Speaker 7:  seen the opinion, I can see like, oh he really was

110
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:22,725
Speaker 7:  kind of probably already drafting this and thinking about a lot of these

111
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:25,885
Speaker 7:  sections of the opinion even back then.

112
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:30,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah, so the, the, the ruling in the case 286

113
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:33,965
Speaker 4:  pages yesterday, I said to Sarah JI thought it was readable. And she was

114
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:36,925
Speaker 4:  like, you don't, you don't know what readable means. That's clear lawyer

115
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:41,045
Speaker 4:  You can read it. It's not like at one point

116
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,725
Speaker 4:  there he's talking about how ad auctions work and there's literally like

117
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:47,045
Speaker 4:  mathematical formula in it. It's there, there's a lot in

118
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:50,725
Speaker 4:  286 pages. But the main holdings are Google

119
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:54,285
Speaker 4:  search is a monopoly and he found that there's a market for general

120
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:57,685
Speaker 4:  search engines. Alex, you and I have talked about this,

121
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,485
Speaker 4:  whenever there's antitrust cases, the tech companies try to argue that markets

122
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:06,005
Speaker 4:  don't exist. Like Facebook is basically held off in antitrust action

123
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:10,005
Speaker 4:  by insisting that there's no such thing as a market for social networks and

124
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:13,685
Speaker 4:  Facebook is not in it. Even if there was, and that has worked until kind

125
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:17,445
Speaker 4:  of now when the judge found, okay, general search engines are a thing, people

126
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:21,405
Speaker 4:  understand what they are is distinct from TikTok search or whatever. So he

127
00:08:21,405 --> 00:08:24,605
Speaker 4:  found general search as a market and Google is the only competitor and there's

128
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,845
Speaker 4:  a line in there. He is like, these are Fortune 500 companies, apple and whoever

129
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:30,685
Speaker 4:  else, and they can only turn to Google. There's nowhere else for 'em to go.

130
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:34,485
Speaker 6:  I really like the way that he defined that. It seemed like it was actually

131
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:38,325
Speaker 6:  the clearer way to say it, which is just a general search

132
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:42,245
Speaker 6:  engine encompasses a lot of the web. It's not a silo like TikTok,

133
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:46,125
Speaker 6:  TikTok, You can, I mean I've used TikTok for search to find

134
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:50,045
Speaker 6:  things that I'm looking at, but it's only TikTok content. And I thought the

135
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:54,005
Speaker 6:  way he just kind of clearly defined general search as being an

136
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:57,605
Speaker 6:  aggregation of a lot of different sources of content was helpful. Even like

137
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:01,485
Speaker 6:  following the trial, not as in the weeds as Lauren, but like I, the

138
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:05,325
Speaker 6:  definition stuff was always pretty wonky to me how they were defining different

139
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:07,725
Speaker 6:  corners of search. And I thought he actually did a pretty good job in the

140
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:10,365
Speaker 6:  opinion, the final ruling here laying it out. Oh

141
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:14,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I, that was something that during the closing arguments, I remember

142
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:18,125
Speaker 7:  the judge, I think Google was trying to make the case that, you know,

143
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:21,565
Speaker 7:  Amazon is a potential competitor and all these other things. And I remember

144
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:24,725
Speaker 7:  the judge saying something along the lines of like, well, you know, Amazon

145
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:28,045
Speaker 7:  doesn't like index the web. Like it is a different thing. So I think that's

146
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:29,245
Speaker 7:  something that he really took to heart.

147
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:33,125
Speaker 4:  He points out that he had expert witnesses in the case

148
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:37,645
Speaker 4:  who testified that the biggest advertisers on Google

149
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:41,565
Speaker 4:  and Bing are vertical search engines. So like

150
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:45,285
Speaker 4:  flight search engines or travel search engines or whatever. They advertise

151
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:47,685
Speaker 4:  a lot on Google 'cause that's where the audience for their searches are.

152
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:51,485
Speaker 4:  And he is like, well this is, they're obviously not substitutes. Like if

153
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:54,085
Speaker 4:  you're, if you're trying to acquire audience for your vertical search engine

154
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:57,805
Speaker 4:  and travel or whatever on Google, Google is obviously not substituted for

155
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,605
Speaker 4:  that. So he, he lays out this case and you know, if you want to get into

156
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:05,005
Speaker 4:  the nitty gritty legal analysis of it, you should just listen to to coder

157
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,565
Speaker 4:  with cantor 'cause we got into it and part of it is

158
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:12,125
Speaker 4:  understanding how the government is getting better at

159
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,605
Speaker 4:  defining these markets. 'cause this is where they have gotten tripped up

160
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:18,285
Speaker 4:  and where the tech companies have really won and pushed off a lot of this

161
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,605
Speaker 4:  enforcement for years by just, by just

162
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:26,205
Speaker 4:  tying these like deep philosophical knots of like what is it Even the market

163
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:30,165
Speaker 4:  that Google is in, even in this case, this is one of the funniest

164
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:34,485
Speaker 4:  counter arguments that Google made. They said that Google is not in the market

165
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:38,285
Speaker 4:  for search engines, it's in the market for answering queries.

166
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:42,925
Speaker 4:  Sure. Just like broadly, just like if you have a question, that's

167
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:46,885
Speaker 4:  the thing that Google does. Yeah. And like they're like every place you might

168
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:49,365
Speaker 4:  answer a question is a place that competes with Google. And the judge was

169
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:52,765
Speaker 4:  like, no. Like that's not true. If you search Amazon, you only get products,

170
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:55,885
Speaker 4:  you don't get answers to questions. Google is this like very general search

171
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:59,085
Speaker 4:  engine. So the government went there, they said a search engine and they

172
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:02,645
Speaker 4:  said that they're anti-competitive protecting the monopoly in search that

173
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:06,205
Speaker 4:  they have with the deals with Apple, which we should talk about at length.

174
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:10,845
Speaker 4:  So Apple pays Google $20 billion a year on the order of

175
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:14,485
Speaker 4:  $20 billion a year to be the default search provider on iOS and

176
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:18,525
Speaker 4:  the Mac and other Apple products. There are some conditions which are

177
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:21,725
Speaker 4:  the thing that make those deals anti-competitive. It's not just the money.

178
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:25,245
Speaker 4:  We should talk about those. And then they found that there's a monopoly for

179
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:29,125
Speaker 4:  search text ads, which is just the text ads in search,

180
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:33,005
Speaker 4:  not general search ads because there you do have competition from

181
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:36,925
Speaker 4:  TikTok and Amazon and all this other stuff, but search text ads, the ones

182
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:40,805
Speaker 4:  that show up on the search engine results page, the judge said, Hey, there's

183
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:44,685
Speaker 4:  a monopoly here and Google has acted anti competitively and this is I think

184
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:48,605
Speaker 4:  the shadiest part of the whole trial.

185
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:52,605
Speaker 4:  Google just slowly raises the prices of those ads

186
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:57,045
Speaker 4:  without considering what competitors might do or arrivals might go and

187
00:11:57,045 --> 00:12:00,885
Speaker 4:  they hide those price increases in the auctions. Well

188
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:01,205
Speaker 4:  that was

189
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:04,885
Speaker 5:  What the judge said, like that was why he found that to be a monopoly, right?

190
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:08,325
Speaker 5:  Was because they just didn't have to care about anyone else and they could

191
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:12,205
Speaker 5:  just raise prices whenever. And he said, yeah, that's just the monopoly guys.

192
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:13,125
Speaker 5:  I don't know what to tell you.

193
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:16,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah, he did this in, in in both in the advertising part and in the search

194
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:19,885
Speaker 4:  engine part where he pointed out Google does stuff and it doesn't care that

195
00:12:19,885 --> 00:12:23,765
Speaker 4:  people might leave. Which is, as we have noted on the

196
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:27,725
Speaker 4:  show many times, like the most essential truth of

197
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:31,605
Speaker 4:  the Google experience right now is like, boy you just blow stuff up,

198
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,445
Speaker 4:  you cancel stuff, you shut it down, you make it worse and there's nowhere

199
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:38,325
Speaker 4:  else to go and Google doesn't seem to care. And the judge pointed

200
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:41,205
Speaker 4:  out, he was like, this is only a firm with monopoly power can get away with

201
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:45,165
Speaker 4:  some of the stuff that they do, including raising prices by making it

202
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,725
Speaker 4:  appear that the auctions, you know when you buy an ad on Google search, like

203
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:52,525
Speaker 4:  buy a keyword, you buy like airline flights or whatever, keyword hotels.

204
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:55,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah these are like hotly contested keywords. You wanna put advertising around

205
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:59,485
Speaker 4:  those keywords in search. And so Google is raising the prices of those

206
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:03,485
Speaker 4:  auctions making it appear as though it's like noisy, like there's a

207
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:07,245
Speaker 4:  more demand or it's fluctuating but really over time it's just raising the

208
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,805
Speaker 4:  price. And that the judge found was that that was evidence of monopoly behavior

209
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:14,685
Speaker 4:  and also just like wrong, right? So this, this is a huge decision.

210
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:17,725
Speaker 4:  There's stuff where they didn't, the government didn't win. There's no monopoly

211
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:21,565
Speaker 4:  in like, there's no monopoly in general search advertising.

212
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:25,685
Speaker 4:  The Google didn't get sanctioned for the way it treats. Its like ad tech

213
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:28,845
Speaker 4:  stack, which you probably know is called double click and now has another

214
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:31,885
Speaker 4:  name and then Google deleted a lot of its chat history and the government

215
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:34,965
Speaker 4:  wanted sanctions for that and then Google deleted a lot of internal records

216
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:37,405
Speaker 4:  and the government wanted sanctions for that. I didn't get that. So that's

217
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:39,885
Speaker 4:  all cast aside. But the main ones, the important ones are Google search and

218
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:43,285
Speaker 4:  Monopoly. Google's acting anti competitively. Google text ads are a monopoly.

219
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:47,445
Speaker 4:  Google is raising the prices anti competitively. That's, it just feels

220
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:51,405
Speaker 4:  like a huge deal. Cantor told me this case goes on the Mount Rushmore

221
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:54,485
Speaker 4:  of antitrust decisions, which, well you, you, which implies there's a Mount

222
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:55,765
Speaker 4:  Rushmore of antitrust decisions.

223
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:58,685
Speaker 5:  Like I wanna talk about a lot of the Apple stuff here. But you talked at

224
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:02,445
Speaker 5:  Cantor, did he explain what they're gonna do next? Did he,

225
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:04,485
Speaker 5:  did he say Oh yeah we're gonna get 'em for this.

226
00:14:04,905 --> 00:14:08,285
Speaker 4:  Oh so this is, yeah this is important to note. Lauren, I'm, I'm curious if

227
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:11,285
Speaker 4:  you've heard anything here but the, the trial is what's called a bifurcated

228
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,165
Speaker 4:  trial. So there's this part which is did you do it and is it wrong?

229
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:19,965
Speaker 4:  Yes, Google search monopoly. Then there's what's called the remedies phase

230
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:23,885
Speaker 4:  where the court lays out a process for how it will basically hold a second

231
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:27,645
Speaker 4:  trial where they'll figure out what the punishment is and how they will fix

232
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:31,365
Speaker 4:  it. And that could be anything the government could ask for anything. The

233
00:14:31,365 --> 00:14:34,765
Speaker 4:  court could impose anything. It could be fines, it could be structural

234
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:38,325
Speaker 4:  that's breaking up Google, it could be behavioral. In other cases the, you

235
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:41,685
Speaker 4:  know, there's like oversight of a company's behavior to make sure it doesn't

236
00:14:41,685 --> 00:14:45,165
Speaker 4:  do the bad thing. Again all they're all kind of all on the table and Cantor

237
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:48,525
Speaker 4:  just, I mean like he's a government lawyer. I was like answer the question.

238
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:51,125
Speaker 4:  He is like, I'm not gonna answer your question. Like very directly, very

239
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:54,845
Speaker 4:  charmingly. It was like, I'm super not answering your question but You can,

240
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:58,885
Speaker 4:  You can look back to history. You know the Microsoft case comes up over

241
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:02,885
Speaker 4:  and over again in this and that was like a lengthy remedies phase, also

242
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:06,285
Speaker 4:  bifurcated trial. They negotiated a settlement then there was a second trial

243
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:10,125
Speaker 4:  to see if the settlement was fair and then Microsoft was under the microscope

244
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:14,405
Speaker 4:  with oversight for a long time to make sure it didn't do a bunch of Microsoft

245
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:17,645
Speaker 4:  stuff. You can, You can see that potentially happening in here.

246
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:22,735
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Lauren, did you get any sense from like, I guess they're in DC of

247
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:25,455
Speaker 5:  people at how they're, how they're gonna react to it, what kind of punishments

248
00:15:25,455 --> 00:15:29,135
Speaker 5:  they might wanna do. Seeing his cantor was like refusing to give neli any

249
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:31,015
Speaker 5:  of the good stuff. He was just like, nah.

250
00:15:32,045 --> 00:15:35,735
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I mean I think that I, I know that a lot of the

251
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:39,735
Speaker 7:  rivals to Google who have been, you know, really cheering

252
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,815
Speaker 7:  on this case from the DOJ side, they, you know, I think

253
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:47,535
Speaker 7:  they're really cheering this decision but at the same time are holding

254
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:51,375
Speaker 7:  back a little bit because they know that what really matters here is

255
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:55,615
Speaker 7:  what Google is made to do to respond to the

256
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:59,495
Speaker 7:  finding of liability. So I think, you know, there is a little

257
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:03,615
Speaker 7:  bit of hesitance that, you know, maybe there's gonna be some

258
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:07,495
Speaker 7:  sort of remedy that doesn't fully fix the problems. You know, maybe something

259
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:11,335
Speaker 7:  like a search screen that we've seen in Europe that like doesn't really seem

260
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:15,175
Speaker 7:  to do too much. So I think there's just a feeling of

261
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,735
Speaker 7:  like, alright we're really happy about this but also we know it's not done

262
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:19,415
Speaker 7:  yet. Yeah,

263
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:23,455
Speaker 4:  We should know. Google has already said it's gonna appeal. The ruling, the

264
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:26,495
Speaker 4:  statement from president of Global Affairs Kent Walker is,

265
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:29,975
Speaker 4:  it's actually pretty funny. It says this decision recognizes that Google

266
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:33,175
Speaker 4:  offers the best search engine but concludes we shouldn't be allowed to make

267
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:37,095
Speaker 4:  it easily available. It's, he's basically saying that this is nonsensical.

268
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:41,095
Speaker 4:  I don't know if that is what the decision actually says. It is true.

269
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:44,375
Speaker 4:  The decision says over and over again Google is the best search engine but

270
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,855
Speaker 4:  then is like, it's also the only one. Like

271
00:16:48,095 --> 00:16:52,015
Speaker 7:  I think it's also that, you know, I think the judge bought

272
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:55,975
Speaker 7:  into this argument that the DOJ was making that like there's kind of

273
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:59,815
Speaker 7:  this flywheel effect where like we, you know, it gets

274
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:03,775
Speaker 7:  all these defaults like gets all these people to use its platform

275
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:06,815
Speaker 7:  and you know, make all these queries and then it has all this really good

276
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:09,975
Speaker 7:  data and then it uses that data to

277
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:14,695
Speaker 7:  just make the search engine better and monetize that.

278
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:18,695
Speaker 7:  And so I think, you know, he's saying yeah it is a really good

279
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:22,615
Speaker 7:  product but that's also because of these

280
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:25,975
Speaker 7:  exclusive contracts that have gotten it to that place. Which

281
00:17:25,975 --> 00:17:29,295
Speaker 5:  Like the, I think maybe you pointed this out Neli or maybe it was Sarah J

282
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:32,895
Speaker 5:  online that Apple is gonna have to like,

283
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,415
Speaker 5:  like Apple could have taken that $20 billion it gives Google every time and

284
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:40,455
Speaker 5:  gone and made its own competitive search engine for

285
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:44,135
Speaker 5:  less than that. And that kind of like factored into the judge's

286
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:44,855
Speaker 5:  reasoning.

287
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:48,375
Speaker 4:  Yeah we should really, we should generally talk about Apple but yeah let's

288
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,445
Speaker 4:  talk about Apple. Yeah know Google pays Apple $20 billion a year and Google

289
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:55,525
Speaker 4:  has also internally estimated that for Apple to build a search engine

290
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:59,405
Speaker 4:  will cost Apple $20 billion, right? Hmm. So there's only

291
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:03,445
Speaker 4:  so many companies that can compete with Google. One of them is

292
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:06,925
Speaker 4:  Apple, one of them. And, and you know, and there's like lots of reasons and

293
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:10,365
Speaker 4:  there's lots of reasons for that. One of them, the most important one

294
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:14,525
Speaker 4:  is that Apple can set the default on an iPhone so it can collect all of this

295
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:17,765
Speaker 4:  data and like a huge percentage

296
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:22,085
Speaker 4:  of Google's queries for search come

297
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:26,045
Speaker 4:  from default placements, right? It's like 50% of all Google search

298
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:30,285
Speaker 4:  queries come from default placements on mobile or desktop, whether it's Android

299
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:34,205
Speaker 4:  phones or iPhones or whatever. So Apple has a massive share of those

300
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:37,645
Speaker 4:  default placements, particularly on mobile. And so it could build a search

301
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:40,645
Speaker 4:  engine, it can compete 'cause it has all of that and Google pays the money

302
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:44,445
Speaker 4:  to keep them from doing it. And inside of that

303
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:48,485
Speaker 4:  services agreement it also puts in conditions that

304
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:52,125
Speaker 4:  Apple agrees not to make things that look like search

305
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:55,765
Speaker 4:  better at search. So Siri can't get better

306
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,925
Speaker 4:  like the, I think the agreement says it can't get better than it is today

307
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:02,165
Speaker 4:  or it can't be meaningful improved password to today Spotlight search can't

308
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:05,605
Speaker 4:  get better. There's some documents that are, you know, as part of the exhibits,

309
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:09,245
Speaker 4:  apple considered putting some advertising into Spotlight search

310
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:13,045
Speaker 4:  on the iPhone and they just like, well we gotta talk to Google about that

311
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:15,365
Speaker 4:  but we don't wanna renegotiate this Google deal. I guess we won't do that

312
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:18,925
Speaker 4:  and You can just see them. They're just held back by the existence of this

313
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:22,565
Speaker 4:  deal and its conditions with Google. Like we've asked a million times, why

314
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:25,845
Speaker 4:  doesn't Apple just build a search engine? And the answer is $20 billion a

315
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:29,765
Speaker 4:  year. Yep. That's just fully the answer. And that's actually the thing

316
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:33,725
Speaker 4:  that's anti-competitive, not the default placement, right? Not

317
00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:36,285
Speaker 4:  buying the default. It's the conditions that say You can, you also cannot

318
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:37,645
Speaker 4:  compete with us but

319
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:42,045
Speaker 5:  Apple doesn't want to. Right? Like, like they said, no we don't

320
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:43,845
Speaker 5:  wanna use Bing, we don't wanna put something else

321
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:47,605
Speaker 4:  In. So one of the absolute funniest conditions of

322
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:51,445
Speaker 4:  the agreement with Google is that Apple is required to defend

323
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:55,325
Speaker 4:  the deal against regulatory actions. So like yeah,

324
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:58,765
Speaker 4:  apple said a bunch of stuff that trial but they're legally

325
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:02,885
Speaker 4:  obligated because of their contract with Google to cod defend the

326
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:05,285
Speaker 4:  deal in the face of regulatory efforts.

327
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:09,285
Speaker 5:  That's not shady. That's that's totally normal way it's pretty to do business.

328
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:10,125
Speaker 5:  That's fine.

329
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:12,965
Speaker 4:  So yeah, I mean it's true that Apple says they don't want to, they don't

330
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:15,605
Speaker 4:  need to. Apple repeatedly said that Google is the best. There are some incredible

331
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:19,445
Speaker 4:  quotes here. Eddie Q testified, they said

332
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:22,605
Speaker 4:  would you ever use Bing? And he said there's no price Microsoft could pay

333
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:26,165
Speaker 4:  to make us set Bing as the default. And then he said they could give us the

334
00:20:26,165 --> 00:20:29,925
Speaker 4:  whole thing for free. They could give us the company and we

335
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:32,965
Speaker 4:  wouldn't use Bing like Microsoft, you could just have Microsoft. And he is

336
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,645
Speaker 4:  like, no, Google is the best. And it's like maybe you believe that

337
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:40,365
Speaker 4:  but maybe you have a contract that says you have to say it like I don't know.

338
00:20:40,595 --> 00:20:43,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like if, if you rolled up to Tim Cook and you're like here's what we

339
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:46,685
Speaker 4:  get Microsoft like I feel like he'd be like we should talk about this.

340
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,085
Speaker 5:  I mean Bing is

341
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:53,605
Speaker 5:  notoriously awful. Maybe just like Eddie was trying to like find some good

342
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:54,525
Speaker 5:  flight deals.

343
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:58,965
Speaker 6:  Obviously he has to say that I think it's interesting that this contract

344
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:03,085
Speaker 6:  was also done in 2016. So Apple and

345
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:07,005
Speaker 6:  the the most recent search contract between Apple and Google, which means

346
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:10,645
Speaker 6:  that they knew in 2016 that this deal

347
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:14,725
Speaker 6:  looked bad and they put a clause in saying they both needed to defend

348
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:18,525
Speaker 6:  themselves against regulators. That's just a massive red flag. I

349
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:22,005
Speaker 6:  don't know about you guys, I always felt like Google was gonna lose this

350
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:25,725
Speaker 6:  case just because of how mafia like this

351
00:21:25,955 --> 00:21:29,765
Speaker 6:  arrangement has been. And the problem with Google's

352
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:33,005
Speaker 6:  core argument at a very high level is this inherent

353
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:36,965
Speaker 6:  contradiction of their argument was we're winning 'cause we're the

354
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:40,085
Speaker 6:  best, we're the best search engine, right? That was their at the highest

355
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:43,925
Speaker 6:  level legal argument, but then also paying a

356
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:47,885
Speaker 6:  lot of money to win. Yeah. So what is it? Is it actually because you're

357
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:51,405
Speaker 6:  the best or because you're paying money? And Google was never able to address

358
00:21:51,405 --> 00:21:55,365
Speaker 6:  that contradiction because I think they know that this contract is anti-competitive.

359
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:59,485
Speaker 6:  I think all sides know this and I don't think it's started that way. Like

360
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,285
Speaker 6:  I don't think it's an over exaggeration either to say that this contract

361
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:07,045
Speaker 6:  has shaped Silicon Valley, maybe more than any other

362
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:11,645
Speaker 6:  contract between two companies in the sense of how Google and Apple

363
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:14,685
Speaker 6:  grew together and have been kind of weirdly joined at the hip

364
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:19,165
Speaker 6:  since, you know, I the iPhone with Steve Jobs and

365
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:22,565
Speaker 6:  Eric Schmidt coming on stage together and

366
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,445
Speaker 6:  they've kind of let each other grow and not,

367
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:30,285
Speaker 6:  you know, there hasn't been a turf war because of this very lucrative deal.

368
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:34,245
Speaker 6:  So you've got things like Apple uses Google Cloud a lot.

369
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:38,765
Speaker 6:  We found out that Apple intelligence was trained exclusively on

370
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:42,685
Speaker 6:  Google's TPUs instead of Nvidia hardware. Google helps

371
00:22:42,815 --> 00:22:45,605
Speaker 6:  serve advertising through Apple's

372
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:49,925
Speaker 6:  integrated iOS placements that's been happening for years.

373
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:54,205
Speaker 6:  They've just like become very enjoined in a way that yeah,

374
00:22:54,735 --> 00:22:58,725
Speaker 6:  Eddie could say, you know, we we're not gonna like do

375
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:02,605
Speaker 6:  this for the whole company. But it's also like that's that's

376
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:06,485
Speaker 6:  because they kind of already are doing this with, with Google.

377
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:06,765
Speaker 6:  Like they,

378
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,445
Speaker 5:  So they really did just kind of carve out and say like, okay, you get this

379
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:14,485
Speaker 5:  set. I mean, not on paper, but they really did just kind of carve

380
00:23:14,485 --> 00:23:17,245
Speaker 5:  things out and say, okay, you get search, we're gonna take phones.

381
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:18,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

382
00:23:18,595 --> 00:23:21,565
Speaker 4:  Well I I don't I think there's like teams inside of Google who, who do not

383
00:23:21,565 --> 00:23:22,605
Speaker 4:  know that anyone

384
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:23,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like pixel teams.

385
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:27,525
Speaker 4:  Like what? But you know, it's, it's fascinating. The, the phone piece

386
00:23:27,545 --> 00:23:30,765
Speaker 4:  is really interesting, right? Because obviously Android, Android exists and

387
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:34,885
Speaker 4:  I agree with you Alex, I think the contract that Google has shaped a lot

388
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:38,885
Speaker 4:  of thing that I agree with the ox. I think that the Apple Google contract

389
00:23:38,945 --> 00:23:42,925
Speaker 4:  in particular has shaped a lot of things and it's like a black

390
00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:46,670
Speaker 4:  hole. It's like dis distorted the fabric of tech space time around it for

391
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,565
Speaker 4:  a long time. But Google has these same deals with tons of other

392
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:54,685
Speaker 4:  companies. It has these deals with carriers, it has T-Mobile and

393
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:58,205
Speaker 4:  at t and Verizon all have similar default placement deals

394
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,325
Speaker 4:  because you know, the carriers provision apps and services on the phones

395
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:05,125
Speaker 4:  they sell and Google knows that's like a very powerful mechanism of

396
00:24:05,365 --> 00:24:09,165
Speaker 4:  distribution. And if they didn't pay Microsoft would and then Microsoft

397
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:13,125
Speaker 4:  would've slightly more distribution. There's a study in the case the

398
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,645
Speaker 4:  the judge cites from inside of Google. It's very small. I'm gonna warn you

399
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:19,565
Speaker 4:  now the sample size is tiny, it's like 26 people. But Google that a study

400
00:24:19,565 --> 00:24:23,445
Speaker 4:  of 26 people and they found that half of them did not

401
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:26,965
Speaker 4:  know when Google was switched out for Bing on their iPhones. They just like

402
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,845
Speaker 4:  didn't notice because no one notices. That

403
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:30,445
Speaker 5:  Seems real,

404
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:34,165
Speaker 4:  Right? And like these defaults are super powerful. The government cantor

405
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:37,285
Speaker 4:  told me he is like the, the, the thing we did for the first time in any antitrust

406
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:41,165
Speaker 4:  case is we put a behavioral scientist on the stand to point out that

407
00:24:41,185 --> 00:24:44,685
Speaker 4:  no one changes the defaults and habits are powerful And that, and the judge

408
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:48,045
Speaker 4:  bought it. Like he comes back to the testimony from this behavioral scientist

409
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:52,005
Speaker 4:  several times at one point, I think this is like the most Vergecast thing

410
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:55,685
Speaker 4:  ever. You might recall that Verizon owned Yahoo. They they did,

411
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:59,245
Speaker 4:  they did. That was a surreal thing that happened inside of a company called

412
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:02,445
Speaker 4:  Oath that they made that combined Yahoo with a OL.

413
00:25:02,995 --> 00:25:06,725
Speaker 4:  This isn't important except to say like The Verge was born out of

414
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:10,765
Speaker 4:  AOL's bullshit. So like it's very personal to me that Verizon made oath

415
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:14,285
Speaker 4:  at one point but Verizon owned Yahoo and it wanted to

416
00:25:14,355 --> 00:25:18,325
Speaker 4:  preload Yahoo search on its phones and they looked at

417
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:20,965
Speaker 4:  the opportunity cost of doing that and how much it would work, how much it

418
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:23,565
Speaker 4:  would cost and what it would take. And they looked at the check from Google

419
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:27,805
Speaker 4:  and they picked the check from Google, right? They took their

420
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:30,445
Speaker 4:  own product that they had bought and they're like, we could make this good

421
00:25:30,825 --> 00:25:33,725
Speaker 4:  by putting it in front of more people and getting that clickstream data and

422
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,445
Speaker 4:  making the search engine better. Or we could just take Google's money

423
00:25:37,665 --> 00:25:41,085
Speaker 4:  and Google's like, what if it was more money and then Verizon caved and they

424
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:44,205
Speaker 4:  flipped Yahoo and you're like whoa, why? Why didn't anyone ever try with

425
00:25:44,205 --> 00:25:47,725
Speaker 4:  Yahoo? It's because Google just made sure it couldn't get the

426
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:51,925
Speaker 4:  distribution. Also very, VIR has one of my favorite parts of this whole decision.

427
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,765
Speaker 4:  There's a lengthy conversation about bloatware and Android phones

428
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:59,565
Speaker 4:  and I don't know if I believe this, but there's all this evidence

429
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:04,045
Speaker 4:  that people won't accept three browsers on their phones

430
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:09,005
Speaker 4:  or three search widgets, but they will take two because Samsung

431
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:13,045
Speaker 4:  has two, right? So like there's like internal Google emails and evidence

432
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:16,805
Speaker 4:  and like meeting notes where they're like we're not so worried

433
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:21,045
Speaker 4:  that our deal with Samsung for distribution where there's

434
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:24,765
Speaker 4:  our browser and Samsung's browser is under threat from

435
00:26:24,965 --> 00:26:27,525
Speaker 4:  Microsoft. 'cause no one would ever accept three browsers. And it's like,

436
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:30,165
Speaker 4:  I don't know man, I feel like Samsung's like one minute away from doing three

437
00:26:30,245 --> 00:26:31,525
Speaker 4:  browsers. Samsung

438
00:26:31,665 --> 00:26:33,965
Speaker 5:  Is a hundred percent, is it Samsung gonna do like four different

439
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:36,885
Speaker 4:  Browsers? Yeah. It's like we're very close and like no one, they're like

440
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:40,645
Speaker 4:  absolutely not two search widgets on the home screen, heaven

441
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:43,885
Speaker 4:  forbid. And it's like, I don't know, have you met these carriers? Yeah. Like

442
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:47,725
Speaker 4:  if not for your exclusivity contracts. Like they would put two search

443
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:49,925
Speaker 4:  widgets on the home screen. Like I think they just, they're minutes away

444
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:50,885
Speaker 4:  from doing this. They

445
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:54,485
Speaker 5:  Just forgot Bloatware. They just like forgot how bloated phones were before

446
00:26:54,485 --> 00:26:57,605
Speaker 4:  Apple. It's a, there's a lengthy discussion of bloatware in this decision

447
00:26:57,665 --> 00:27:00,365
Speaker 4:  and how Google sort of like used the threat of bloatware

448
00:27:01,465 --> 00:27:04,805
Speaker 4:  to, to make sure they were an exclusive provider of search on on these devices.

449
00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:08,725
Speaker 4:  And you just see it up and down the stack. They, they find their angles

450
00:27:08,985 --> 00:27:11,485
Speaker 4:  to make sure there isn't competition and they press their advantage on those

451
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:15,125
Speaker 4:  angles. And I, to me it's well that's why we don't have other search

452
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:18,445
Speaker 4:  engines. Like there's Bing and Bing just isn't good enough

453
00:27:18,905 --> 00:27:22,885
Speaker 4:  and like the judge basically says Bing isn't good enough. Apple maybe asked

454
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:26,165
Speaker 4:  required to say it says Bing isn't good enough. Google's out there running

455
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:29,925
Speaker 4:  benchmarks saying Bing isn't good enough and then sort of knowingly making

456
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:33,485
Speaker 4:  their product worse and it's fine. What

457
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,005
Speaker 5:  Was the number? There was one number in the, in the decision that was like

458
00:27:36,345 --> 00:27:40,245
Speaker 5:  it would take Bing 17 years to get the same

459
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:43,125
Speaker 5:  amount of click data that Google gets in a day or something.

460
00:27:43,465 --> 00:27:47,445
Speaker 7:  So basically in this opinion the judge says that

461
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:51,565
Speaker 7:  13 months of user data acquired by Google is equivalent to over 17

462
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:53,005
Speaker 7:  years of data on Bing,

463
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:57,605
Speaker 4:  Right? And that's like the amount of amount of use Google gets in 13

464
00:27:57,605 --> 00:28:00,365
Speaker 4:  months is it would take being 17 years

465
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:04,645
Speaker 4:  and all of that feeds back into the ranking model. It's like a really interesting

466
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:08,565
Speaker 4:  thing in this opinion is the stuff

467
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:12,405
Speaker 4:  he dismisses, right? He says TikTok is not a competitor Google search. And

468
00:28:12,405 --> 00:28:16,165
Speaker 4:  then he's like, I know you all want me to talk about AI and how AI might

469
00:28:16,635 --> 00:28:19,725
Speaker 4:  like dero Google search but we're not there yet. It hasn't happened yet.

470
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:23,485
Speaker 4:  I don't see it and I've got all this evidence and testimony from Google's

471
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:27,365
Speaker 4:  on people saying they need the user data even when they try

472
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:31,165
Speaker 4:  the AI tools, even when Google puts its AI models up to make the search results,

473
00:28:31,595 --> 00:28:34,685
Speaker 4:  it's the click data that actually helps them refine the search.

474
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:38,925
Speaker 6:  They need the feedback loop, right? Yeah. And this is what I

475
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,725
Speaker 6:  hear talking to like Meta and other companies. Like they

476
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:46,485
Speaker 6:  really think that the people who win at large scale network effects businesses

477
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:50,005
Speaker 6:  like this just have the feedback loop and AI

478
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:53,925
Speaker 6:  search. If it just gives you the answer you're not

479
00:28:54,085 --> 00:28:58,005
Speaker 6:  learning a lot about is the answer good, how can we improve it?

480
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:01,325
Speaker 6:  Because you don't have an interface where people are browsing clicking the

481
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:05,085
Speaker 6:  links going from pages and yeah it's smart of Google. I,

482
00:29:05,345 --> 00:29:09,165
Speaker 6:  you know, they recognized early that search was a network

483
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:12,445
Speaker 6:  effects business and aggregator business and

484
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:16,805
Speaker 6:  they went out and bought all kinds of distribution. They did

485
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:20,605
Speaker 6:  Android purely to get Google search out there on phones. They

486
00:29:20,765 --> 00:29:24,605
Speaker 6:  realized they didn't own a phone so they made an, they bought an OS and scaled

487
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:28,445
Speaker 6:  it and did all these like funny business, you know, deals

488
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:32,805
Speaker 6:  to basically bundle. And this is like, this is a tale as old

489
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:36,525
Speaker 6:  as ti as time. I mean Microsoft, we'll get into this I'm sure Microsoft

490
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:40,485
Speaker 6:  20 years ago got its hand slapped by the DOJ for doing almost the

491
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:44,205
Speaker 6:  exact same thing. And the characters that come up in this case

492
00:29:44,675 --> 00:29:48,565
Speaker 6:  have a fascinating background in that case. Like Kent Walker

493
00:29:49,015 --> 00:29:52,485
Speaker 6:  who's running legal at Google was the general counsel for Netscape during

494
00:29:52,485 --> 00:29:56,445
Speaker 6:  the Microsoft antitrust trial. Like he, he understands like

495
00:29:56,465 --> 00:30:00,325
Speaker 6:  he understands bundling and what it does to the smaller players. You can't

496
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:04,245
Speaker 6:  see this if you're listening to this, but I'm wearing a Microsoft logo shirt

497
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:06,485
Speaker 4:  From the early two 2000 from the trials and

498
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:10,205
Speaker 6:  Of this beautiful. So yeah, I just find it interesting that like

499
00:30:10,785 --> 00:30:14,485
Speaker 6:  if you look back at the last time a case like this was brought was Microsoft

500
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:18,405
Speaker 6:  and Microsoft was so dominant, so ascended and the question was will

501
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:22,605
Speaker 6:  Microsoft control the consumer and point to the internet, right?

502
00:30:22,945 --> 00:30:26,925
Speaker 6:  And now 20 years later as a result of that decision, Microsoft didn't get

503
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,845
Speaker 6:  broken up but it changed a lot as a result. We've got Eddie

504
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:34,725
Speaker 6:  Q in court saying you couldn't give me all of Microsoft to use bank. Right?

505
00:30:35,145 --> 00:30:38,565
Speaker 6:  And it's like what does that mean for Google in 20 years? Yeah. Like that's

506
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:41,725
Speaker 6:  what these cases do and this is why it's such a big deal long term.

507
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:45,565
Speaker 4:  So this is what Cantor has said to me on decoder, again, I won't get too

508
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:49,165
Speaker 4:  into the weeds and legal stuff, but his takeaway, his big consumery

509
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:53,245
Speaker 4:  takeaway was this case is a continuation of the Microsoft

510
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:57,205
Speaker 4:  case. The opinion itself, the judge makes endless references to the Microsoft

511
00:30:57,205 --> 00:31:00,845
Speaker 4:  opinion. He says I'm using the same analytical framework as the Microsoft

512
00:31:00,845 --> 00:31:04,805
Speaker 4:  case. And Cantor's point to me was that case was about

513
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:08,605
Speaker 4:  the application model moving from Windows to the web, which it

514
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:12,405
Speaker 4:  definitely did. Now whether or not you want to ascribe that to antitrust

515
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:16,125
Speaker 4:  action or not, a lot of people have a lot of arguments. But a thing that

516
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:19,965
Speaker 4:  really happened is we run apps and web browsers now and not natively

517
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:23,645
Speaker 4:  on Intel processors on Windows. Like we just run web apps. We're making this

518
00:31:23,645 --> 00:31:26,445
Speaker 4:  podcast in a web app right now. A very cranky web app I would add that only

519
00:31:26,445 --> 00:31:28,325
Speaker 4:  runs in Chrome. There's your antitrust problems.

520
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:35,805
Speaker 4:  But the application model moved to the web, it allowed a company like

521
00:31:35,805 --> 00:31:39,725
Speaker 4:  Google to exist because Microsoft wasn't able to bundle Internet Explorer

522
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:43,565
Speaker 4:  and force out other browsers. So you had browser competition, which meant

523
00:31:43,565 --> 00:31:45,885
Speaker 4:  you had application model competition on and on and on. And now you get to

524
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:49,285
Speaker 4:  Google and now the government has cases against not only Google but also

525
00:31:49,335 --> 00:31:53,245
Speaker 4:  Apple basically alleging the same thing and cantor's like we have to

526
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:57,005
Speaker 4:  make sure the next generation of applications is allowed to exist. And it's

527
00:31:57,005 --> 00:32:00,605
Speaker 4:  these moments when everyone can see the change that the incumbents

528
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:04,845
Speaker 4:  try to crush the, in the insurgent models. And he, his

529
00:32:04,845 --> 00:32:08,125
Speaker 4:  point is Google is trying to do that potentially with AI search. They see

530
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,565
Speaker 4:  it coming. So they're trying to lock down their advantage and make sure no

531
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:13,605
Speaker 4:  one else gets distribution, right? And they can capture that market and he

532
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:16,925
Speaker 4:  thinks Apple is trying to do that on the iPhone too. I dunno if they're gonna

533
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:20,685
Speaker 4:  win the Apple case, but that's the sort of his theory of the situation is

534
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:24,645
Speaker 4:  a direct continuation from Microsoft. The Microsoft case is generally interesting

535
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:29,205
Speaker 4:  because you know it's been 20, they, they started that investigation in 1990

536
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:32,685
Speaker 4:  and they reached resolution in what, 2001? Yeah. So that took a long time

537
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,405
Speaker 4:  and you know, bill Gates is out there being like, yeah that distracted me

538
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:41,125
Speaker 4:  so I didn't do smartphones. and it's like, yeah, like that's one way of thinking

539
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,405
Speaker 4:  about it. But you also made Windows foam, which was bad.

540
00:32:45,185 --> 00:32:47,885
Speaker 5:  That's what he likes to say. Like he's just like, it distracted me. It's

541
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:51,285
Speaker 5:  like, no, it didn't distract you that much 'cause you made a phone, you just

542
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:53,645
Speaker 5:  made a crummy phone and you don't want people to know talk about it.

543
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:54,725
Speaker 4:  Well

544
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:58,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it, it makes these companies, especially at this scale just

545
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:02,085
Speaker 6:  super skittish, right? And you're, and I do think there is an argument that

546
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:06,365
Speaker 6:  Microsoft missed the mobile wave and didn't do it right because

547
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:09,765
Speaker 6:  it was skittish because it was on, it was on its back foot, it was

548
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:13,245
Speaker 6:  subsumed by litigation and regulatory response internally.

549
00:33:14,065 --> 00:33:17,885
Speaker 6:  And it's hard to not see that maybe playing out with Google

550
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:21,605
Speaker 6:  here and You can see Google already reacting this way in that like

551
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:25,565
Speaker 6:  they're, the way that they fake bought at character AI last

552
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:29,485
Speaker 6:  week for example, which is totally wild. It came out after

553
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:32,645
Speaker 6:  The Vergecast last week, I'll just quickly recap it. They basically bought

554
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:36,485
Speaker 6:  this AI company without doing it and they paid all the investors

555
00:33:36,585 --> 00:33:39,965
Speaker 6:  and the employees as if they bought the company, but they only took the AI

556
00:33:39,965 --> 00:33:43,805
Speaker 6:  people and are leaving the husk, the flaming husk of what they left

557
00:33:43,805 --> 00:33:47,325
Speaker 6:  behind And saying good luck but

558
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:50,965
Speaker 6:  not a, not a m and a event because they didn't buy equity.

559
00:33:52,185 --> 00:33:55,805
Speaker 6:  But they're doing deals like this because they already feel this

560
00:33:55,915 --> 00:33:59,805
Speaker 6:  antitrust scrutiny and they're not able to take the kind of big swings that

561
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:03,525
Speaker 6:  they took to get to where they are now, which is buying YouTube, buying

562
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:06,685
Speaker 6:  double click, buying these things that fortified their monopoly.

563
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:10,245
Speaker 6:  And there's a really strong argument to be made that in the same way this

564
00:34:10,555 --> 00:34:14,165
Speaker 6:  kept Microsoft from being able to be so aggressive in the early two

565
00:34:14,405 --> 00:34:17,445
Speaker 6:  thousands that could happen again with Google here. Okay,

566
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:21,245
Speaker 4:  But here's the counter argument to that. Microsoft was distracted and

567
00:34:21,995 --> 00:34:25,205
Speaker 4:  lost in compliance efforts and I dunno, bill Gate was drinking tequila and

568
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:27,365
Speaker 4:  screaming at the moon about the Department of Justice or whatever he was

569
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,125
Speaker 4:  doing instead of inventing the iPhone

570
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:31,125
Speaker 5:  Jumping over chairs.

571
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:33,685
Speaker 4:  I do believe that fine, maybe you believe that's a hundred percent true.

572
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:38,365
Speaker 4:  Google exists. Apple was allowed to be resurgent

573
00:34:38,435 --> 00:34:42,365
Speaker 4:  because they put out the iMac with a web browser on it.

574
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:46,165
Speaker 4:  Like the, the iMac running OS nine when it came out was

575
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:50,005
Speaker 4:  not like there's a suite of great OS nine

576
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:53,845
Speaker 4:  applications for the Mac. It was, this is the computer

577
00:34:53,845 --> 00:34:57,245
Speaker 4:  that's easiest to get on the web with. That's how they marketed it because

578
00:34:57,385 --> 00:34:59,725
Speaker 4:  the web was the application environment, it was the thing everybody wanted.

579
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:03,245
Speaker 4:  It wasn't a bunch of weird intel CD rom Windows

580
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:07,245
Speaker 4:  applications or whatever was happening before. And Carta was not the thing,

581
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,845
Speaker 4:  right? It was the web and that worked

582
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:15,365
Speaker 4:  like I, here we are in 2024 and we're like Apple and Google are dominant

583
00:35:15,845 --> 00:35:19,565
Speaker 4:  companies because Microsoft was forced

584
00:35:19,705 --> 00:35:23,525
Speaker 4:  or coerced or distracted away from foreclosing that competition.

585
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:27,565
Speaker 4:  And it's pretty hard. Like You can look at that in hindsight and

586
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:31,885
Speaker 4:  I promise you a bunch of old head VCs and investors will like,

587
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:35,965
Speaker 4:  and x Microsoft executives in particular will litigate and

588
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:39,205
Speaker 4:  re-litigate whether that actually happened or whether Apple was just better

589
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:43,285
Speaker 4:  or whatever. But it is true that Microsoft was turned away and the web was

590
00:35:43,285 --> 00:35:46,925
Speaker 4:  allowed to be dominant and the dominance of the web is what enabled the iMac

591
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:49,885
Speaker 4:  to be successful. And now we're here with the iPhone, right? Like that's

592
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:50,205
Speaker 4:  the line.

593
00:35:51,195 --> 00:35:54,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think that's what a lot of advocates for antitrust

594
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:58,285
Speaker 7:  enforcement would say is just like, yeah maybe, you know, with

595
00:35:58,565 --> 00:36:02,205
Speaker 7:  Microsoft, we saw Microsoft bogged down and it's legal

596
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:06,445
Speaker 7:  woes for a while, but you know what would've been a bad

597
00:36:06,445 --> 00:36:10,005
Speaker 7:  outcome was like never getting the rise of Apple and Google in the first

598
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:13,605
Speaker 7:  place. Never getting those products. Not that Microsoft wasn't the one to

599
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:14,365
Speaker 7:  invent those.

600
00:36:14,515 --> 00:36:17,165
Speaker 5:  Well, and also Microsoft is doing just

601
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:18,645
Speaker 4:  They figured it out.

602
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:21,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah, right. Like, like it forced 'em to be competitive. It forced 'em to

603
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:25,085
Speaker 5:  think that's why they, they they invested in Azure and, and they built up

604
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:28,845
Speaker 5:  this, this huge cloud computing business. Yeah.

605
00:36:29,045 --> 00:36:32,205
Speaker 4:  Microsoft is literal, Nadel is like, I wanna make a dance. Like yeah, like

606
00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:33,205
Speaker 4:  having a good time of his life.

607
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:36,685
Speaker 5:  Like competition is in fact good. And when these companies get so big that

608
00:36:36,685 --> 00:36:40,445
Speaker 5:  they don't compete, we do see things like this and I'm, I'm not just saying

609
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:44,085
Speaker 5:  that because I just bought a car with Google inside and it's hot garbage

610
00:36:44,385 --> 00:36:48,165
Speaker 5:  and I can really feel how their, their monopoly is

611
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:51,045
Speaker 5:  affecting me personally. But you do feel it like everything. Oh, you

612
00:36:51,565 --> 00:36:54,365
Speaker 6:  Feel it. Oh you feel it. Google's stock price in the last five years is up

613
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:57,285
Speaker 6:  177%. Do we feel like search has gotten

614
00:36:57,405 --> 00:36:59,645
Speaker 6:  177% better in the last

615
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:01,285
Speaker 5:  Five years? Worse. It's actually theyve

616
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:04,845
Speaker 4:  Gone opposite direct. No, they've canceled 177% of their products.

617
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:08,725
Speaker 4:  That's all they've done. They've just, they've just end of life

618
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:12,725
Speaker 4:  177% of the things they invented. But

619
00:37:12,885 --> 00:37:16,045
Speaker 4:  I think this is the part that's really hard and I, you know, you couldn't

620
00:37:16,045 --> 00:37:20,005
Speaker 4:  have guaranteed in 2001 that Apple would be resurgent or that Google

621
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:22,725
Speaker 4:  would come to be dominant on the web. That they, they're dominant and I think

622
00:37:22,725 --> 00:37:25,965
Speaker 4:  it's really hard to sit here in 2024 and predict that OpenAI won

623
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:30,565
Speaker 4:  will now have a chance to become the next Google OpenAI won. Which I

624
00:37:30,565 --> 00:37:34,405
Speaker 4:  will remind everyone, Microsoft owns 51% You can

625
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:38,165
Speaker 4:  49 You can't predict. You can't predict that it's 49. You can't

626
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:42,125
Speaker 4:  predict that Microsoft will, or you can't predict that TikTok

627
00:37:42,515 --> 00:37:45,885
Speaker 4:  will actually turn into a search engine because it has some designs on like

628
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:49,805
Speaker 4:  larger search applications who might get banned. Like

629
00:37:50,055 --> 00:37:54,005
Speaker 4:  there might be some startup that, you know next year is

630
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,805
Speaker 4:  gonna take off and grow at the scale. It's really hard to make the

631
00:37:57,805 --> 00:38:01,005
Speaker 4:  forward-looking argument, especially when we don't know what the remedy is

632
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:04,925
Speaker 4:  gonna be. Right? If the government shows up and says break up Google and

633
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:08,805
Speaker 4:  the only way to fix this is to, I break up YouTube and Google and the

634
00:38:08,805 --> 00:38:11,845
Speaker 4:  first thing YouTube is gonna do is build a general search engine. 'cause

635
00:38:11,845 --> 00:38:15,125
Speaker 4:  it's obvious that that's what they should do. And the first thing newly broken

636
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:19,045
Speaker 4:  up Google will do is build a video platform. 'cause like sure, but is what

637
00:38:19,045 --> 00:38:21,365
Speaker 4:  they're gonna ask for. We don't know Lauren, I just gonna ask Lauren, I

638
00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:24,885
Speaker 6:  I was gonna ask Lauren this, do we think the DOJ actually wants to break

639
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,285
Speaker 6:  up Google? I think they actually just want Google to not be able to

640
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:31,405
Speaker 6:  spend 30 billion a year buying their distribution.

641
00:38:32,485 --> 00:38:36,445
Speaker 7:  I mean I would, I think the strongest signal we have is just the

642
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:40,165
Speaker 7:  statements from Cantor himself about how he thinks about

643
00:38:40,165 --> 00:38:43,885
Speaker 7:  remedies generally, and that's that he prefers structural remedies,

644
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:47,765
Speaker 7:  AKA breakups. And so I think how, how sweeping

645
00:38:47,765 --> 00:38:51,685
Speaker 7:  will that structural remedy be that they ask for? I don't know, but,

646
00:38:52,225 --> 00:38:56,005
Speaker 7:  and you know, will they, is there a chance that they decide it's better to

647
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:59,885
Speaker 7:  go with a behavioral remedy, AKA like ask them to stop doing

648
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:03,565
Speaker 7:  something, ask them to stop putting certain terms in their contracts? Maybe

649
00:39:03,565 --> 00:39:07,245
Speaker 7:  they think that's more appropriate in this case, but I think

650
00:39:07,665 --> 00:39:10,965
Speaker 7:  we have to seriously consider that, you know, this

651
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:15,365
Speaker 7:  structural remedies are something that Jonathan Cantor tends to

652
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:16,045
Speaker 7:  like.

653
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:19,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah, well sure. My guess my point is like negotiating 1 0 1 is you always

654
00:39:19,945 --> 00:39:22,325
Speaker 6:  ask for more than you know you're gonna get. I think they will

655
00:39:22,325 --> 00:39:24,645
Speaker 4:  Gimme the whole company. Yeah, give me all of Microsoft.

656
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:28,525
Speaker 6:  They will obviously ask to break up Google. I think in Cantor's heart of

657
00:39:28,525 --> 00:39:32,165
Speaker 6:  hearts, he would actually be okay if all that came out of this case

658
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:35,525
Speaker 6:  was what happened in the Microsoft case, which is the government went for

659
00:39:35,525 --> 00:39:39,485
Speaker 6:  a breakup, they didn't get it, but Microsoft was foreclosed from doing these

660
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:43,565
Speaker 6:  bundling anti-competitive contracts for distribution. I have

661
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:46,805
Speaker 6:  to think the DOJ would be happy with that and that would be just as I think

662
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:50,445
Speaker 6:  impactful on all of tech if

663
00:39:50,705 --> 00:39:53,525
Speaker 6:  Google just can't buy out its distribution.

664
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,445
Speaker 5:  But but would would it?

665
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:56,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think

666
00:39:56,765 --> 00:40:00,645
Speaker 5:  So because I, I think like how, if you think of, okay, how do they do

667
00:40:00,645 --> 00:40:03,165
Speaker 5:  that? How do they change that? Well then first thing, how do you change it

668
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:06,525
Speaker 5:  on the iPhone? How do you change what that default is because there's always

669
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:07,365
Speaker 5:  a default.

670
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:11,925
Speaker 4:  Well, so I, one of inside of that question I think is a very

671
00:40:12,335 --> 00:40:16,245
Speaker 4:  weird thing, which, so inside of that

672
00:40:16,365 --> 00:40:19,605
Speaker 4:  question I think is a, a, a hard problem to grapple with, which is right

673
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:23,525
Speaker 4:  now Apple collects $20 billion here from Google. If it can no longer collect

674
00:40:23,525 --> 00:40:27,405
Speaker 4:  that money, will it spend money to make its own search

675
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:29,845
Speaker 4:  product? I that weird, it's not spending on

676
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:30,085
Speaker 5:  Bing,

677
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:34,365
Speaker 4:  Right? It's yeah, it's not gonna take the money from Bing as we know at EQ

678
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:38,325
Speaker 4:  won't, there's no sum. He's unviable integrity is unimpeachable

679
00:40:38,665 --> 00:40:42,485
Speaker 4:  by Bing specifically. But you know, Cantor told

680
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:46,125
Speaker 4:  me that he thinks that AI turn is a big inflection point

681
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:50,525
Speaker 4:  and he wants the remedy to be forward looking, right? He's not like, he's

682
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:53,885
Speaker 4:  like, I can't fix 15 years of anti-competitive behavior. I need to make it

683
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:57,685
Speaker 4:  so the future has competition in it. So if you prevent the money, if you

684
00:40:57,685 --> 00:41:01,245
Speaker 4:  prevent the 20 billion from an Apple, does Apple invest more in Apple intelligence?

685
00:41:01,245 --> 00:41:05,205
Speaker 4:  Does it start answering more questions directly? Does it make, you

686
00:41:05,205 --> 00:41:08,845
Speaker 4:  know, right now it's OpenAI won is the, the sort of general search product

687
00:41:08,845 --> 00:41:11,525
Speaker 4:  built into Apple intelligence, but we know they're gonna make a deal with

688
00:41:11,525 --> 00:41:15,445
Speaker 4:  Google too. Maybe there's more choices there, right? And like

689
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:19,285
Speaker 4:  Apple's going to to to more providers and You can see like maybe

690
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:22,165
Speaker 4:  that creates a different outcome.

691
00:41:22,755 --> 00:41:25,645
Speaker 5:  Like for me it's like, is it gonna make Siri better?

692
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:30,445
Speaker 6:  I think we're underestimating the power of money and the power of

693
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:34,205
Speaker 6:  when you're, so yes, 20, it's 20 billion, but it's actually more than that.

694
00:41:34,275 --> 00:41:38,245
Speaker 6:  It's, it's a meaningful percent of Apple's profit margin because the Google

695
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,685
Speaker 6:  check is a hundred percent margin. So when you subtract the Google

696
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:45,725
Speaker 6:  money Apple services business, which is the narrative for the future

697
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:48,805
Speaker 6:  growth of the stock that Tim Cook has been spending for 10 years collapsed

698
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:52,565
Speaker 6:  by a quarter, it's significant. And I think we're

699
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:55,965
Speaker 6:  underestimating the just capitalistic inherent

700
00:41:56,275 --> 00:42:00,125
Speaker 6:  drivers here of when you are not getting a check to not do

701
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,725
Speaker 6:  something anymore, you may go do that thing.

702
00:42:03,985 --> 00:42:07,725
Speaker 6:  And for the last, you know, 10 years, Apple's been getting paid an

703
00:42:08,005 --> 00:42:10,965
Speaker 6:  ungodly amount of money to just like, don't look over there.

704
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:14,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Hey Liam, just to end on this, we've talked a lot about the, the decision

705
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:17,925
Speaker 4:  and the mechanics of Apple and what might happen next. Heath, you're, you

706
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:20,405
Speaker 4:  know, you're sourced inside all these companies. What's the vibe inside of

707
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:23,605
Speaker 4:  Google right now? Are they afraid? Are they worried? Are they watching their

708
00:42:23,605 --> 00:42:24,965
Speaker 4:  stock price? Like what, what's happening?

709
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:28,645
Speaker 6:  They're always watching the stock price. I think that

710
00:42:29,075 --> 00:42:32,365
Speaker 6:  what will really start to change things is when we get closer

711
00:42:32,915 --> 00:42:35,685
Speaker 6:  into this remedy phase and there's an actual sense of

712
00:42:36,905 --> 00:42:40,845
Speaker 6:  is it a breakup? Is it Apple can no longer, you know,

713
00:42:41,355 --> 00:42:45,125
Speaker 6:  just be our default. Do we have to like make this a fair playing field?

714
00:42:45,265 --> 00:42:48,245
Speaker 6:  We have to open up our distribution lanes. We can't bundle

715
00:42:50,075 --> 00:42:53,525
Speaker 6:  Android and search when that stuff starts becoming more

716
00:42:53,845 --> 00:42:57,805
Speaker 6:  concretely explained, which Lauren, correct me if I'm wrong, but it

717
00:42:57,805 --> 00:43:01,125
Speaker 6:  sounds like will be this fall, this is happening pretty soon, right? So

718
00:43:01,725 --> 00:43:05,365
Speaker 6:  I would say by this fall, what will happen if the Microsoft case is any

719
00:43:06,165 --> 00:43:09,685
Speaker 6:  indication is there will be a ton of scrambling inside Google, there'll be

720
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:13,045
Speaker 6:  a whole division spun up to address this. Whatever structural changes they

721
00:43:13,045 --> 00:43:14,725
Speaker 6:  need to make, should they lose this on appeal.

722
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:20,245
Speaker 6:  And it's going to be messy because it's, it's

723
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:23,165
Speaker 6:  hard to, I've been thinking about this like who does this hurt more in the

724
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:26,805
Speaker 6:  short term Apple or Google? Because Apple

725
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:30,485
Speaker 6:  gets the money, which will hurt its stock price, but

726
00:43:30,725 --> 00:43:34,605
Speaker 6:  Google's not gonna have its distribution, which will also

727
00:43:34,605 --> 00:43:38,565
Speaker 6:  hurt its stock price. I have to think that Apple already

728
00:43:38,665 --> 00:43:42,565
Speaker 6:  has the scenarios mapped out of what it will do, should it lose this

729
00:43:42,565 --> 00:43:46,445
Speaker 6:  case. The vibe I've gotten inside Google is that they've actually been

730
00:43:46,445 --> 00:43:50,405
Speaker 6:  kind of gritting their teeth and just praying that this won't

731
00:43:50,405 --> 00:43:54,045
Speaker 6:  happen, which is the Microsoft approach. 20 years ago,

732
00:43:55,045 --> 00:43:57,485
Speaker 4:  Microsoft had other businesses though. I just wanna point

733
00:43:57,485 --> 00:44:01,125
Speaker 6:  This out. No, Google does too. Like Google Cloud is huge like Google and

734
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:01,565
Speaker 6:  YouTube,

735
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:02,725
Speaker 4:  But not huge compared to search.

736
00:44:03,525 --> 00:44:07,485
Speaker 6:  I think YouTube and Google Cloud together are as big

737
00:44:07,485 --> 00:44:08,485
Speaker 6:  as search if not bigger.

738
00:44:08,835 --> 00:44:11,645
Speaker 5:  Nila, you don't think the pixel is gonna come around?

739
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:15,045
Speaker 5:  XR is about to like blow us all away.

740
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:18,845
Speaker 4:  I'm just saying Google has all of its eggs are in this basket. Well

741
00:44:18,845 --> 00:44:22,805
Speaker 6:  All of its eggs are in Gemini. Yeah. And I think, you know, we saw this this

742
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:26,525
Speaker 6:  week with like Gemini in the new Nest lineup, right? They're putting Gemini

743
00:44:26,525 --> 00:44:30,285
Speaker 6:  everywhere. I thought it was really interesting how we were at IO and

744
00:44:30,545 --> 00:44:34,485
Speaker 6:  Gemini was such a big part of the Pixel Android experience

745
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:38,365
Speaker 6:  and it's only gonna be on Pixel. I think they really are betting on Gemini

746
00:44:38,655 --> 00:44:42,645
Speaker 6:  being the thing that kind of makes them something that consumers willingly

747
00:44:42,645 --> 00:44:46,605
Speaker 6:  pick again because they didn't have to worry about this for the last 10

748
00:44:46,605 --> 00:44:50,285
Speaker 6:  years, was search and Gemini for them

749
00:44:50,425 --> 00:44:54,245
Speaker 6:  has to work as a thing that makes people interested in Google as an actual

750
00:44:54,245 --> 00:44:58,205
Speaker 6:  innovator again. And I think that is their big bet to survive this

751
00:44:58,205 --> 00:45:00,005
Speaker 6:  change. Should they lose the Apple deal?

752
00:45:00,715 --> 00:45:04,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. All right, we'll see. Again, we're not at the remedies phase yet.

753
00:45:05,465 --> 00:45:09,245
Speaker 4:  If you want to read all 286 pages of the opinion, it's it,

754
00:45:09,245 --> 00:45:12,285
Speaker 4:  we'll put a link in the show notes. And, if you want a deep dive onto like

755
00:45:12,285 --> 00:45:16,245
Speaker 4:  the legal mechanics of it. We'll link to that episode of Dakota where Cantor,

756
00:45:16,605 --> 00:45:19,845
Speaker 4:  'cause he, we got very nerdy and at one point I think he was like, what are

757
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:21,565
Speaker 4:  you doing? Stop it.

758
00:45:23,745 --> 00:45:26,125
Speaker 4:  But we'll link all that in the show notes. We gotta take a break. We are,

759
00:45:26,135 --> 00:45:29,725
Speaker 4:  we're, we're well on our way to going over already. We'll be right back.

760
00:47:30,565 --> 00:47:34,485
Speaker 6:  50% year over year. And I think there's a lot of pressure on

761
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:38,165
Speaker 6:  Linda ya carino the CEO ish of

762
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:42,165
Speaker 6:  X to find revenue and Elon

763
00:47:43,455 --> 00:47:47,445
Speaker 6:  hates this trade group and probably said

764
00:47:47,445 --> 00:47:50,885
Speaker 6:  we just need to sue them like you did with OpenAI won, et cetera.

765
00:47:52,265 --> 00:47:56,205
Speaker 6:  And it's a trade group, so you know, it's not the companies that

766
00:47:56,205 --> 00:48:00,125
Speaker 6:  make that spend the money. It's a, it's a thing that, it's an entity

767
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:04,165
Speaker 6:  that is a middleman that helps them decide how to spend the money. But the

768
00:48:04,195 --> 00:48:08,085
Speaker 6:  idea that any trade group has the ability to keep

769
00:48:08,245 --> 00:48:09,165
Speaker 6:  Unilever from

770
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:13,925
Speaker 6:  spending on a platform is, shows a fundamental

771
00:48:14,605 --> 00:48:17,605
Speaker 6:  misunderstanding of the advertising ecosystem. Well isn't

772
00:48:17,755 --> 00:48:19,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah, X also a member

773
00:48:19,745 --> 00:48:23,405
Speaker 6:  Of the trade and they're a member and they tweeted that they were proud

774
00:48:23,585 --> 00:48:25,645
Speaker 6:  to be a member last month. So

775
00:48:27,595 --> 00:48:31,125
Speaker 6:  yeah, I Linda ya Carino posted a very,

776
00:48:32,185 --> 00:48:32,965
Speaker 6:  I'm just gonna say a

777
00:48:32,965 --> 00:48:33,485
Speaker 5:  Hostage video

778
00:48:33,555 --> 00:48:34,445
Speaker 6:  Hostage. She not hostage.

779
00:48:34,775 --> 00:48:37,445
Speaker 4:  She's not hostage. No, no, she's not host that. True. She's just bad at making

780
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:38,205
Speaker 4:  videos. Well,

781
00:48:38,205 --> 00:48:41,925
Speaker 6:  It could have been ai I don't know. The, the necklace saying, mama and then

782
00:48:42,035 --> 00:48:44,365
Speaker 6:  free speech makes me think it wasn't ai. No.

783
00:48:44,365 --> 00:48:48,085
Speaker 4:  These are all choices she made in her dumb bubble where people think that

784
00:48:48,085 --> 00:48:51,925
Speaker 4:  shit's cool speech. There's nothing about her that's a hostage or unwitting

785
00:48:52,395 --> 00:48:56,045
Speaker 4:  like we have. I she was at code last year, we saw her. She like, she's

786
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:56,645
Speaker 6:  Real. She's

787
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:58,565
Speaker 4:  Doing this 'cause she wants to Yes,

788
00:48:59,005 --> 00:49:02,765
Speaker 6:  I think so. I think there's a big part of where people

789
00:49:02,905 --> 00:49:06,405
Speaker 6:  at x this is just from like my sources and Kylie's, like

790
00:49:06,705 --> 00:49:10,325
Speaker 6:  really feel the fading of their relevance as a company.

791
00:49:10,745 --> 00:49:14,245
Speaker 6:  It was really funny, like Linda held an all hands after filing this lawsuit

792
00:49:14,435 --> 00:49:18,285
Speaker 6:  that our Kylie Robinson was, was getting info from, from

793
00:49:18,365 --> 00:49:19,645
Speaker 6:  a source. And

794
00:49:21,755 --> 00:49:25,285
Speaker 6:  when journalists started like posting what was happening to us all hands,

795
00:49:25,305 --> 00:49:29,285
Speaker 6:  she sat in the all hands like, look, this shows that we're important. Which

796
00:49:29,285 --> 00:49:33,205
Speaker 6:  I think is just like a sign of the vibe,

797
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:37,005
Speaker 6:  which is like X is thrashing around trying to be

798
00:49:37,005 --> 00:49:40,605
Speaker 6:  important. And I think litigation is a very classic

799
00:49:40,915 --> 00:49:44,885
Speaker 6:  Elon way of feeling important. And this is also has, like,

800
00:49:45,465 --> 00:49:49,245
Speaker 6:  it has Jim Jordan wrapped up in it. Lauren, I I I just,

801
00:49:49,365 --> 00:49:51,245
Speaker 6:  I this makes me just want to like roll my eyes.

802
00:49:51,245 --> 00:49:53,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah, because he was upset, right? Like he he did a thing last year. Yeah.

803
00:49:53,765 --> 00:49:57,725
Speaker 6:  Lauren, can you explain the, the Republican Congress,

804
00:49:57,905 --> 00:50:01,885
Speaker 6:  Jim Jordan aspect of this? Because it's, it's, it's like brain worms,

805
00:50:01,885 --> 00:50:04,445
Speaker 6:  but it, we, it's probably important to explain they are

806
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:05,645
Speaker 4:  Important brain worms. Yeah.

807
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:06,325
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

808
00:50:08,385 --> 00:50:11,685
Speaker 7:  Oh well, oh yeah. I forgot that Jim Jordan

809
00:50:12,265 --> 00:50:15,885
Speaker 7:  did send this letter to companies in this group

810
00:50:16,465 --> 00:50:20,445
Speaker 7:  asking about this boycott and you know, this is like

811
00:50:20,445 --> 00:50:24,325
Speaker 7:  the kind of thing that Jim Jordan likes to get involved in.

812
00:50:24,505 --> 00:50:28,125
Speaker 7:  You know, he did a whole thing around the, you know, what he

813
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:32,325
Speaker 7:  has termed like censorship or collusion between the Biden administration

814
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:35,365
Speaker 7:  and and tech companies.

815
00:50:36,705 --> 00:50:40,445
Speaker 7:  So I think this is, you know, right in that sweet

816
00:50:40,475 --> 00:50:41,325
Speaker 7:  spot of like

817
00:50:42,965 --> 00:50:46,485
Speaker 7:  x being this like free speech platform in his eyes

818
00:50:46,705 --> 00:50:50,605
Speaker 7:  that's being harmed by, you know, this group of other

819
00:50:50,605 --> 00:50:54,005
Speaker 7:  corporate entities. So I think like this is

820
00:50:54,595 --> 00:50:57,285
Speaker 7:  just like right in that kinda wheelhouse.

821
00:50:57,545 --> 00:51:01,405
Speaker 4:  And I think I just wanna say something very clearly and look, I know I went

822
00:51:01,405 --> 00:51:04,325
Speaker 4:  to law school. I'm not saying I'm an expert on every aspect of the law. I

823
00:51:04,325 --> 00:51:05,805
Speaker 4:  just know this one thing. Wait, you went to

824
00:51:05,805 --> 00:51:06,125
Speaker 6:  Law school.

825
00:51:06,675 --> 00:51:10,205
Speaker 4:  There's no constitutional duty to spend money

826
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:14,165
Speaker 4:  on advertising. You don't have to do it.

827
00:51:14,465 --> 00:51:17,605
Speaker 4:  And in fact, most of our speech law,

828
00:51:18,315 --> 00:51:21,965
Speaker 4:  like depends on the functioning of a market, right? We're

829
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:26,205
Speaker 4:  like actual, like, you know, there's a cliche phrases like the

830
00:51:26,435 --> 00:51:30,165
Speaker 4:  cure for bad speech is a more speech that we use. We're like, oh

831
00:51:30,165 --> 00:51:33,485
Speaker 4:  we'll just like shovel more into the market and people will make their own

832
00:51:33,485 --> 00:51:36,885
Speaker 4:  choices. And one way You can make choices by spending money. Famously, our

833
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:40,725
Speaker 4:  Supreme Court has held the money in speech disclosure is the holding in Citizens

834
00:51:40,845 --> 00:51:41,885
Speaker 4:  United disclosure,

835
00:51:41,985 --> 00:51:43,765
Speaker 6:  The Verge makes money through advertising,

836
00:51:44,005 --> 00:51:47,925
Speaker 4:  Right? I'm confident we're a part of whatever adver like

837
00:51:48,185 --> 00:51:51,925
Speaker 4:  GM initiative. So like big platform

838
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:56,205
Speaker 4:  companies, it's hard to hold them to account. So the adver, it's

839
00:51:56,205 --> 00:52:00,045
Speaker 4:  like crazy that Unilever can't roll up to meta and

840
00:52:00,045 --> 00:52:03,285
Speaker 4:  be like, don't put our ads next to racism. And meta's like, yeah, I don't

841
00:52:03,285 --> 00:52:05,765
Speaker 4:  know, we'll take it. We'll we'll like have another meeting. So they form

842
00:52:05,765 --> 00:52:09,605
Speaker 4:  these trade organizations to be like, Hey, together we

843
00:52:09,605 --> 00:52:13,565
Speaker 4:  have enough power in the market to make you build the

844
00:52:13,565 --> 00:52:17,525
Speaker 4:  tools for ads. Don't show up next to racism. That's like, that

845
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:21,365
Speaker 4:  is the thing that is happening here. And underlying all of this is this,

846
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:25,965
Speaker 4:  and I'll just say it, it's like the Jim Jordan committee

847
00:52:25,965 --> 00:52:29,165
Speaker 4:  and the Elon Musk and the Linac Arena. They're like, we should be able to

848
00:52:29,165 --> 00:52:33,085
Speaker 4:  do racism and like You can, you should put the money near the

849
00:52:33,085 --> 00:52:34,045
Speaker 4:  racism. Well, no,

850
00:52:34,355 --> 00:52:34,845
Speaker 6:  They're

851
00:52:34,845 --> 00:52:37,805
Speaker 4:  Mad that you don't, they're mad that these companies won't do it. No,

852
00:52:37,805 --> 00:52:41,685
Speaker 6:  There's they, yes they wanna do that, but they also think

853
00:52:41,685 --> 00:52:44,925
Speaker 6:  they deserve money for it. And what you're drawing the distinction on is

854
00:52:45,405 --> 00:52:49,325
Speaker 6:  X has every right to operate its platform in the same way that GM has

855
00:52:49,325 --> 00:52:52,885
Speaker 6:  every right to tell its clients. This is what we think and

856
00:52:53,135 --> 00:52:56,045
Speaker 6:  these are the platforms you think we should, we think you should spend

857
00:52:56,065 --> 00:52:59,845
Speaker 4:  On, et cetera. Right? Until we got to this extremely weird

858
00:52:59,845 --> 00:53:03,565
Speaker 4:  point in American history where people are like, what if, what if racism?

859
00:53:03,835 --> 00:53:07,805
Speaker 4:  Like what if, what if we did some more racism? This is a, it's a weird moment.

860
00:53:07,945 --> 00:53:11,845
Speaker 4:  Up until recently, a thing like GM that was like, we know

861
00:53:11,845 --> 00:53:15,485
Speaker 4:  these platforms are open and anyone can post whatever they want, but we want

862
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:19,125
Speaker 4:  the adver, like we, they're very relevant for the advertisers. So we want

863
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:22,725
Speaker 4:  all the platforms, the advertisers to come together in a committee and have

864
00:53:22,725 --> 00:53:26,685
Speaker 4:  boring meetings and talk about brand safety guidelines and then

865
00:53:26,685 --> 00:53:30,525
Speaker 4:  we'll all make money together. Like that is, I dunno if anyone,

866
00:53:30,525 --> 00:53:33,365
Speaker 4:  like probably a lot of our listeners have been to like marketing conventions.

867
00:53:33,365 --> 00:53:36,685
Speaker 4:  Like I've been, I've talked to a lot of advertisers in my time. Like they're

868
00:53:36,685 --> 00:53:40,045
Speaker 4:  the money, they're very boring and safe. Like

869
00:53:40,565 --> 00:53:44,125
Speaker 4:  advertisers do not want to be near a bunch of Nazi stuff. So

870
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:46,765
Speaker 4:  they're like, we're gonna go work with the platforms and we're gonna build

871
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:50,725
Speaker 4:  these guidelines. And Twitter was in it. And what you're finding out

872
00:53:50,725 --> 00:53:53,725
Speaker 4:  now is like Twitter doesn't want to offer those controls.

873
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:58,125
Speaker 4:  The owner keeps tweeting weird racist stuff,

874
00:53:58,615 --> 00:54:02,405
Speaker 4:  which makes the platform seem not safe. And then boosting his own reach.

875
00:54:03,355 --> 00:54:07,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like you don't have to spend money next to that. And it's,

876
00:54:07,145 --> 00:54:10,085
Speaker 4:  you know, they filed it in this in Texas where they're gonna get a favorable

877
00:54:10,085 --> 00:54:12,965
Speaker 4:  judge. I'm sure they're gonna get some weird favor ruling, but eventually

878
00:54:12,965 --> 00:54:16,765
Speaker 4:  you're gonna have to contend with the idea that not spending money

879
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:20,765
Speaker 4:  somehow harms the free speech of racist on Twitter.

880
00:54:21,505 --> 00:54:25,285
Speaker 4:  And like, I don't think You can get that far. I think You can force a lot

881
00:54:25,285 --> 00:54:28,285
Speaker 4:  of people to spend a lot of money defending that action. I think You can

882
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:32,205
Speaker 4:  scare a lot of advertisers. The way that people have scared Bud Light,

883
00:54:32,975 --> 00:54:36,685
Speaker 4:  right? You can scare the World Federation of Advertisers, the trade

884
00:54:36,685 --> 00:54:40,605
Speaker 4:  organization into dissolving gm, which is two people in

885
00:54:40,605 --> 00:54:43,405
Speaker 4:  a conference room and they just, they're, they're done with it now for a

886
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,445
Speaker 5:  While. Their Slack room is closed.

887
00:54:45,225 --> 00:54:49,085
Speaker 4:  You can do a bunch of weird threatening stuff, but at the end of the day,

888
00:54:49,105 --> 00:54:53,045
Speaker 4:  the thing you are arguing for is platforms should have racism on them

889
00:54:53,105 --> 00:54:55,845
Speaker 4:  and advertisers should be okay putting their ads next to that racism And.

890
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:59,165
Speaker 4:  if you don't offer those controls, you still have to spend the money And.

891
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:02,605
Speaker 4:  if you don't, it's like a problem, right? Under this, I would say

892
00:55:03,415 --> 00:55:06,525
Speaker 4:  under this, notably Rumble also filed an antitrust lawsuit

893
00:55:07,045 --> 00:55:08,285
Speaker 4:  alleging that Gar

894
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:11,765
Speaker 5:  Co polluted. Yeah. They're trying to get other people to do it and the only

895
00:55:11,765 --> 00:55:15,525
Speaker 5:  ones who wanna do it are the ones who wanna do racism and are mad that nobody

896
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:17,165
Speaker 5:  will fund their racism.

897
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:21,005
Speaker 4:  I would just point out that Twitter before all of this was not like

898
00:55:21,175 --> 00:55:23,645
Speaker 4:  Disneyland. Yeah, it was,

899
00:55:23,655 --> 00:55:24,525
Speaker 5:  There was some racism.

900
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:28,725
Speaker 4:  YouTube makes a lot of money. There's a lot of weird shit on YouTube.

901
00:55:30,275 --> 00:55:33,525
Speaker 4:  Meta notable provider of Facebook to old people.

902
00:55:35,535 --> 00:55:38,725
Speaker 4:  Weird Trump, Jesus all over, all over Facebook today.

903
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:42,365
Speaker 4:  Right? Like they're, the money's still flowing in because they're playing

904
00:55:42,385 --> 00:55:46,325
Speaker 4:  the game in the market. And Mark Zuckerberg is like, you

905
00:55:46,325 --> 00:55:49,685
Speaker 4:  know, he, he might be cozying up to Peter Thiel and saying Donald Trump is

906
00:55:49,685 --> 00:55:53,045
Speaker 4:  a badass, but his public persona is like, I grew up my hair and I'm drinking

907
00:55:53,165 --> 00:55:56,805
Speaker 4:  a beer on a surfboard. We should all make money together. And that's more

908
00:55:56,805 --> 00:56:00,765
Speaker 4:  or less all you need to do. Not Elon Musk sit at the deal book

909
00:56:00,765 --> 00:56:04,565
Speaker 4:  conference with Andrew os Sorkin and tell Bob Iger to go fuck himself and

910
00:56:04,565 --> 00:56:07,605
Speaker 4:  say, you can't bribe me with money. And now he's like, wait, you're not spending

911
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:08,565
Speaker 4:  the money, I'm gonna sue you.

912
00:56:08,675 --> 00:56:12,325
Speaker 6:  Exactly. And that's what, that's what this is totally about is it's a denial

913
00:56:12,385 --> 00:56:16,085
Speaker 6:  on Elon's part that he has been self-destructive.

914
00:56:16,345 --> 00:56:20,325
Speaker 6:  He has been destructive to X's business and he wants to blame everyone but

915
00:56:20,325 --> 00:56:22,405
Speaker 6:  himself. I think that's ultimately what this comes down

916
00:56:22,405 --> 00:56:26,045
Speaker 5:  To. He's just a litigious bully. He's just like, how can I bully people

917
00:56:26,435 --> 00:56:29,805
Speaker 5:  legally? He's done it plenty of times before. This isn't the first time he's

918
00:56:29,805 --> 00:56:33,485
Speaker 5:  done it. This is probably just one of the stupidest times he's done it.

919
00:56:34,155 --> 00:56:34,445
Speaker 5:  Like,

920
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:38,485
Speaker 4:  You know. Okay, so that's like on the, on the top level. Yeah, it's done

921
00:56:38,485 --> 00:56:42,365
Speaker 4:  right. You, you don't have a constitutional duty to spend money. You

922
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:46,165
Speaker 4:  just don't. So stupid. Then there's the lawsuit itself.

923
00:56:46,545 --> 00:56:49,525
Speaker 4:  And I don't like, I don't wanna pull it's, it's dumb. They, he didn't even

924
00:56:49,525 --> 00:56:52,085
Speaker 4:  get his usual lawyers to file it. He had to go get other lawyers. Like Quin

925
00:56:52,085 --> 00:56:53,445
Speaker 4:  Emanuel, his usual law firm is not

926
00:56:53,835 --> 00:56:54,965
Speaker 6:  This. Oh they aren't Uhuh.

927
00:56:55,385 --> 00:56:57,965
Speaker 5:  That's good. Yeah. Yeah. This is like a real rando. He

928
00:56:57,965 --> 00:57:01,245
Speaker 4:  Had to get someone else to do it. In classic Elon Musk fashion, this

929
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,245
Speaker 4:  complaint centers around a contract that doesn't exist.

930
00:57:06,805 --> 00:57:10,705
Speaker 4:  We love that. He just loves to find contracts that don't exist. So you'll

931
00:57:10,705 --> 00:57:14,545
Speaker 4:  recall when he sued OpenAI won, it was for a contract

932
00:57:14,545 --> 00:57:17,585
Speaker 4:  that didn't exist. He has withdrawn that lawsuit. He refiled it in federal

933
00:57:17,585 --> 00:57:20,905
Speaker 4:  court recently and now he's claiming it's fraud. There's, he took out the

934
00:57:21,065 --> 00:57:24,225
Speaker 4:  contract claims 'cause he realized you can't sue our contract doesn't exist

935
00:57:24,685 --> 00:57:28,305
Speaker 4:  in this case. He's saying there's antitrust, there's collusion.

936
00:57:28,765 --> 00:57:32,585
Speaker 4:  And the way he finds it is by inventing an enforceable

937
00:57:32,945 --> 00:57:35,505
Speaker 4:  contract with this ad trade organization

938
00:57:36,925 --> 00:57:39,985
Speaker 4:  and he has to go find it somewhere. He has to say that it's a contract and

939
00:57:39,985 --> 00:57:43,585
Speaker 4:  it's enforceable and it doesn't exist. Like there's no penalty. Unilever

940
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:47,185
Speaker 4:  spends the money, like they might get an angry call from someone, but like

941
00:57:47,185 --> 00:57:51,105
Speaker 4:  there's no penalty 'cause there's no contract. So he says the agreement

942
00:57:51,165 --> 00:57:54,945
Speaker 4:  by among Gars advertiser advertising agency members to enforce brand safety

943
00:57:55,145 --> 00:57:58,545
Speaker 4:  standards is memorialized in a number of places other than the

944
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:02,545
Speaker 4:  FAQ and the charter. So if you're like, this contract is in

945
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:05,465
Speaker 4:  an FAQ, you're already on your bed, you're, you're wrong and you're like

946
00:58:05,465 --> 00:58:09,185
Speaker 4:  looking at other places. And then it says, for example, in new member applications,

947
00:58:09,525 --> 00:58:12,305
Speaker 4:  Gar m explains that members must agree to work with industry partners in

948
00:58:12,585 --> 00:58:16,385
Speaker 4:  category peers in a collaborative, non-competitive way. That's the

949
00:58:16,385 --> 00:58:17,065
Speaker 4:  application.

950
00:58:19,135 --> 00:58:22,945
Speaker 4:  There's no contract. So you have this like big collusion and

951
00:58:22,945 --> 00:58:26,825
Speaker 4:  underlying it is nothing. and it, I'm telling you this is just there to

952
00:58:26,945 --> 00:58:30,345
Speaker 4:  threaten people. And then there's a devastating what can only be described

953
00:58:30,645 --> 00:58:32,585
Speaker 4:  as a devastating cell phone.

954
00:58:34,505 --> 00:58:38,165
Speaker 4:  The advertising boycott of Twitter now X is contrary to the economic

955
00:58:38,165 --> 00:58:42,005
Speaker 4:  self-interest of the boycotting advertisers. Due to the boycott of

956
00:58:42,005 --> 00:58:45,645
Speaker 4:  Twitter. Prices charged for advertising declined substantially in

957
00:58:45,765 --> 00:58:49,445
Speaker 4:  November, 2022 and remain well below those charged by Xs

958
00:58:49,445 --> 00:58:52,965
Speaker 4:  closest competitors in social media. By refraining from

959
00:58:52,965 --> 00:58:56,765
Speaker 4:  purchasing advertising on x boycotting advertisers are foregoing

960
00:58:56,845 --> 00:59:00,485
Speaker 4:  a valuable opportunity to purchase low priced advertising.

961
00:59:01,995 --> 00:59:02,285
Speaker 4:  This

962
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:03,565
Speaker 7:  Just sounds like an ad for

963
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:04,845
Speaker 4:  X advertising. Well

964
00:59:05,515 --> 00:59:09,445
Speaker 6:  Also that's hilarious. It's also hilarious that Linda posted this video on

965
00:59:09,565 --> 00:59:13,085
Speaker 6:  X where the advertisers she's trying to talk to are not

966
00:59:13,295 --> 00:59:15,485
Speaker 6:  there. They're purposely not there.

967
00:59:15,675 --> 00:59:16,245
Speaker 4:  Well she was,

968
00:59:16,505 --> 00:59:19,965
Speaker 5:  She was there saying it's your voices, right? Yeah. Like he was calling on

969
00:59:19,965 --> 00:59:23,885
Speaker 5:  the the users to effectively attack. Yeah, yeah. All of

970
00:59:23,885 --> 00:59:25,045
Speaker 5:  these folks. So there's like,

971
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:27,525
Speaker 4:  That's and that's like the Bud Light moment, right? Yeah. Like we're mad

972
00:59:27,525 --> 00:59:31,485
Speaker 4:  at Unilever. Go weirdos. Yeah. And like, I

973
00:59:31,765 --> 00:59:35,725
Speaker 4:  I, I personally think there's a lot on the other side of this lawsuit is

974
00:59:35,765 --> 00:59:39,645
Speaker 4:  a lot of powerful advertising money. And they're gonna say, actually,

975
00:59:39,765 --> 00:59:43,445
Speaker 4:  we don't think your platform is brand safe. and it is our money is our speech

976
00:59:43,445 --> 00:59:46,085
Speaker 4:  and we can do whatever we want. And there's, there's no contract here saying

977
00:59:46,085 --> 00:59:49,005
Speaker 4:  we can't do these things. There's a trade organization

978
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:53,645
Speaker 4:  that we rely on so that we all act in a collective way to prevent

979
00:59:53,705 --> 00:59:57,565
Speaker 4:  the monetization of racism. And that's fine. And I, it's

980
00:59:57,565 --> 00:59:59,445
Speaker 4:  really hard to gin up a lot of outreach over.

981
01:00:00,275 --> 01:00:04,085
Speaker 7:  It's a really strange concept that, you know, it's like Linda is

982
01:00:04,085 --> 01:00:07,565
Speaker 7:  asking users to be mad that they're not getting

983
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:11,285
Speaker 7:  advertisements from specific companies. Like, I don't think anyone's ever

984
01:00:11,285 --> 01:00:12,685
Speaker 7:  been mad to not get that.

985
01:00:13,385 --> 01:00:17,165
Speaker 5:  You need to be furious. The charm and bear is not in your feed right now.

986
01:00:17,505 --> 01:00:20,045
Speaker 5:  Got it. Is what she's saying. It's just goofy.

987
01:00:21,355 --> 01:00:24,965
Speaker 4:  It's also funny that they've gone X premium, they're now

988
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,125
Speaker 4:  advertising. It has no ads.

989
01:00:27,645 --> 01:00:29,125
Speaker 4:  'cause you don't, it's 'cause you don't have any ads.

990
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:34,565
Speaker 4:  Alex, how longer, how much longer do you think this iteration of access to

991
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:38,485
Speaker 4:  go, like, to be clear, it is popping off during the election

992
01:00:38,485 --> 01:00:42,205
Speaker 4:  night because in election year there's a lot of activity. Yeah. On the platform.

993
01:00:43,195 --> 01:00:47,085
Speaker 4:  There's a lot of people coming to threads because Elon keeps posting insane

994
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:50,725
Speaker 4:  nonsense. But it's, it's still vibrant in its way.

995
01:00:51,425 --> 01:00:53,325
Speaker 4:  Is it gonna be able to sustain itself over time?

996
01:00:53,965 --> 01:00:57,765
Speaker 6:  I think it's very hard for a platform with this level of

997
01:00:57,765 --> 01:01:01,525
Speaker 6:  scale and network effects in social media to just die quickly.

998
01:01:01,965 --> 01:01:05,725
Speaker 6:  I think it's like we're talking like, or Elon pulls the plug,

999
01:01:05,725 --> 01:01:09,405
Speaker 6:  right? Elon could have a episode and decide to fully pull the plug

1000
01:01:09,905 --> 01:01:13,805
Speaker 6:  or sell it for parts. But barring that, I think it continues to

1001
01:01:13,805 --> 01:01:17,765
Speaker 6:  live on it. Dwindles and influence, if I had to guess

1002
01:01:17,855 --> 01:01:21,805
Speaker 6:  their percentage of users who are regular regularly posting has gone way

1003
01:01:21,805 --> 01:01:25,725
Speaker 6:  down based on just scanning it. Like my,

1004
01:01:25,745 --> 01:01:29,365
Speaker 6:  the my Feed is just a lot of the same accounts now. It's just less,

1005
01:01:29,835 --> 01:01:33,685
Speaker 6:  less interesting, less varied, but it still has

1006
01:01:33,685 --> 01:01:37,085
Speaker 6:  that twitchiness. It's still, and for oddly like in the tech community, the

1007
01:01:37,225 --> 01:01:40,965
Speaker 6:  AI world especially, it's just still where everyone is is and hanging

1008
01:01:41,025 --> 01:01:44,525
Speaker 6:  out and like the OpenAI won. The OpenAI won. People are like, they're just

1009
01:01:44,525 --> 01:01:48,365
Speaker 6:  feeding training data to rock every day. It kind of blows my

1010
01:01:48,365 --> 01:01:51,925
Speaker 6:  mind, but, so yeah.

1011
01:01:52,355 --> 01:01:56,205
Speaker 6:  Threads doesn't quite have that kind of real time

1012
01:01:56,415 --> 01:01:57,325
Speaker 6:  juice and

1013
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:01,805
Speaker 6:  s like Yeah. It just, it's missing that still. Well it's

1014
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:03,725
Speaker 5:  Gonna tell us about the last suit next week. Don't worry.

1015
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:06,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, we'll find out about it last week or next week.

1016
01:02:08,205 --> 01:02:11,125
Speaker 6:  I think, you know, he's betting big on payments. I think we're gonna see

1017
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:14,885
Speaker 6:  that relatively soon, this whole banking play where You can

1018
01:02:15,925 --> 01:02:19,645
Speaker 6:  exchange value with other Nazi supporters on the

1019
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:23,325
Speaker 6:  platform. I mean, I don't, I don't know what that's, you know, he's, I think

1020
01:02:23,325 --> 01:02:26,845
Speaker 6:  they're building that stack from scratch. I would hope so because I could

1021
01:02:26,845 --> 01:02:30,765
Speaker 6:  imagine Stripe turning that off after a while when you realize like what's

1022
01:02:30,765 --> 01:02:34,245
Speaker 6:  happening with that. But yeah, it's kind of just turning into this like,

1023
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:38,405
Speaker 6:  it's a reflection of Elon. It's a reflection of his psyche.

1024
01:02:39,025 --> 01:02:41,685
Speaker 6:  It reminds me a lot of like Rupert Murdoch and Fox

1025
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:46,765
Speaker 6:  and especially how he's using it in this election cycle. It's in stark

1026
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:50,965
Speaker 6:  contrast to Meta and Zuckerberg. Yes, you've got

1027
01:02:50,965 --> 01:02:54,565
Speaker 6:  Zuckerberg on the edges with the Trump stuff, but Meta is like, we're out

1028
01:02:54,565 --> 01:02:57,925
Speaker 6:  of politics. We're, we're not, I think we're not recommending it even, right?

1029
01:02:58,025 --> 01:02:59,285
Speaker 6:  And so it's very different. Prince

1030
01:02:59,305 --> 01:03:01,325
Speaker 5:  Is, Murdoch is successful with

1031
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:01,565
Speaker 4:  Fox.

1032
01:03:02,305 --> 01:03:06,085
Speaker 5:  Fox is like the most successful news network. Yeah. And, and he, he's really

1033
01:03:06,085 --> 01:03:09,685
Speaker 5:  good at it. But Elon's not. He's, he's,

1034
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:12,845
Speaker 6:  Well I think X will start to look more like that. I think it becomes his

1035
01:03:13,095 --> 01:03:14,845
Speaker 6:  media empire.

1036
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,565
Speaker 5:  It's, it's, it's, I mean it's already become that, right? Right. It's already

1037
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:21,085
Speaker 5:  become his place where he can go and spout the most transphobic, racist

1038
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:25,165
Speaker 5:  stuff imaginable and not get yelled at and then

1039
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:28,205
Speaker 5:  sue people because they don't wanna advertise next to that transphobic racist

1040
01:03:28,265 --> 01:03:28,805
Speaker 5:  too. It's just

1041
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,445
Speaker 4:  Very, he's a free speech. Absolutely. Well, yeah.

1042
01:03:30,495 --> 01:03:33,405
Speaker 6:  Wanna be very clear about this. And that's, that's the thing, like he said,

1043
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:36,925
Speaker 6:  we need the, the internet needs its digital town square and that's what X

1044
01:03:36,985 --> 01:03:40,845
Speaker 6:  was gonna be. and it turns out like no one wants to be hanging out

1045
01:03:40,845 --> 01:03:44,605
Speaker 6:  with a bunch of people yelling crazy, insulting, vile stuff.

1046
01:03:44,665 --> 01:03:44,885
Speaker 6:  It

1047
01:03:44,885 --> 01:03:46,285
Speaker 5:  Turns out digital Times Square

1048
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:46,805
Speaker 4:  Sucks.

1049
01:03:46,835 --> 01:03:50,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Times Square is like, you never want to be there unless you're a

1050
01:03:50,485 --> 01:03:54,445
Speaker 6:  tourist and you got conned into a, a guide thing there. So like yeah,

1051
01:03:54,525 --> 01:03:58,285
Speaker 6:  I I I feel like it's just reflecting him more and more

1052
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:02,445
Speaker 6:  and that's going to make it smaller. But it will, it will live on,

1053
01:04:02,525 --> 01:04:05,965
Speaker 6:  I think it stokes his ego and I think he likes having a platform

1054
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:09,525
Speaker 6:  that has a media element to it that also feeds his other businesses,

1055
01:04:10,095 --> 01:04:10,445
Speaker 4:  Which

1056
01:04:10,725 --> 01:04:13,685
Speaker 5:  Gets acquired by the other one first. True social or

1057
01:04:13,845 --> 01:04:16,765
Speaker 5:  XI just summed that. I'm sorry.

1058
01:04:17,005 --> 01:04:20,365
Speaker 4:  I feel like after we gotta wrap this up, we are way over. We got a whole

1059
01:04:20,365 --> 01:04:23,885
Speaker 4:  lightning round. But I feel like that that is like a

1060
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:25,125
Speaker 4:  supernova of garbage

1061
01:04:26,715 --> 01:04:30,365
Speaker 4:  that after this election we will see, right? Yeah. Those things will

1062
01:04:30,365 --> 01:04:34,205
Speaker 4:  collide into each other after this election. But yeah, there's just

1063
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:38,045
Speaker 4:  a, there's a moment happening here where it feels like whatever

1064
01:04:38,525 --> 01:04:40,845
Speaker 4:  platform, we've talked about this so much in the show, whatever platform

1065
01:04:40,845 --> 01:04:44,605
Speaker 4:  era we are in with big search in Google with Twitter

1066
01:04:44,655 --> 01:04:48,205
Speaker 4:  dominating public discourse with Instagram being where all the influencers

1067
01:04:48,205 --> 01:04:51,245
Speaker 4:  are, like all of that is just sort of winding down. Like people are tired

1068
01:04:51,245 --> 01:04:55,165
Speaker 4:  of a lot of it. And like, we'll see what happens next. But You can, You can

1069
01:04:55,165 --> 01:04:58,045
Speaker 4:  feel it like, oh, a bunch of stuff that we took for granted is changing.

1070
01:04:58,345 --> 01:05:01,565
Speaker 4:  And one of them in particular is the dominance of Twitter and the

1071
01:05:01,725 --> 01:05:04,085
Speaker 4:  conversation because he's

1072
01:07:21,905 --> 01:07:25,765
Speaker 5:  as popular. By adding in like a b, C news is now gonna be live.

1073
01:07:25,765 --> 01:07:29,365
Speaker 5:  You'll be able to watch ABC Oh sure. Just on Disney Plus. And I'm like, that's

1074
01:07:29,365 --> 01:07:32,525
Speaker 5:  really smart. I'm really excited about that as someone who doesn't pay for

1075
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:36,605
Speaker 5:  cable. But yeah, Disney's just jacking

1076
01:07:36,605 --> 01:07:39,965
Speaker 5:  the prices up and it's gonna keep happening. I'm sorry folks. I I wish And

1077
01:07:39,965 --> 01:07:42,765
Speaker 4:  They're gonna do, they're cracking down a password sharing in September.

1078
01:07:43,205 --> 01:07:45,725
Speaker 4:  I I So they've just figured it out. They're like, we're gonna charge everyone

1079
01:07:45,725 --> 01:07:46,565
Speaker 4:  a lot of money. Yeah.

1080
01:07:46,565 --> 01:07:50,405
Speaker 5:  They're like, like everybody knows exactly what to do, which is make

1081
01:07:50,405 --> 01:07:53,605
Speaker 5:  everybody pay you a lot of money for things, which is what they were all

1082
01:07:53,605 --> 01:07:56,925
Speaker 5:  doing before streaming. And they're just like, oh my God, what if we did

1083
01:07:56,925 --> 01:07:58,565
Speaker 5:  what we did with cable, but

1084
01:07:58,565 --> 01:08:01,805
Speaker 4:  Now we can, it turns out there is a constitutional duty to pay a lot of money

1085
01:08:01,825 --> 01:08:05,765
Speaker 4:  for Disney. Yeah. That's, and that, that's just baked into the fabric

1086
01:08:05,785 --> 01:08:06,245
Speaker 4:  of America.

1087
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:10,125
Speaker 5:  There. There's, I I I still wait with bated breath for the,

1088
01:08:10,345 --> 01:08:14,245
Speaker 5:  the, the lawsuit or the antitrust suit against Disney

1089
01:08:14,345 --> 01:08:18,285
Speaker 5:  for just buying all of pop culture and owning all

1090
01:08:18,285 --> 01:08:19,565
Speaker 5:  of it. Except for like Taylor Swift.

1091
01:08:19,945 --> 01:08:22,725
Speaker 4:  Hey, I'm gonna go see the Wolverine movie tomorrow. Don't, it's all, we're

1092
01:08:22,725 --> 01:08:23,645
Speaker 4:  close to spoilers already.

1093
01:08:23,885 --> 01:08:26,685
Speaker 5:  I don't wanna spoil it. I don't wanna spoil it, but it is the entire Disney

1094
01:08:27,245 --> 01:08:28,405
Speaker 5:  RA is like in that movie.

1095
01:08:28,945 --> 01:08:31,325
Speaker 4:  All right. So that's, that's Disney.

1096
01:08:32,745 --> 01:08:34,125
Speaker 4:  Lauren, what's your line around?

1097
01:08:34,635 --> 01:08:37,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah, so I've got Microsoft and Delta

1098
01:08:38,555 --> 01:08:42,485
Speaker 7:  just going at each other for, you know, who, who was the issue

1099
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:46,085
Speaker 7:  with Delta having to cancel a bunch of flights after the

1100
01:08:46,085 --> 01:08:50,005
Speaker 7:  CrowdStrike issue. And this whole story is basically the Spider-Man meme.

1101
01:08:51,315 --> 01:08:55,285
Speaker 7:  They're just pointing at each other and it seems like maybe

1102
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:59,325
Speaker 7:  Delta, Delta CEO missed an email from Satya Nadella

1103
01:09:00,685 --> 01:09:03,205
Speaker 7:  offering help. And so it's very good.

1104
01:09:03,475 --> 01:09:03,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

1105
01:09:05,115 --> 01:09:08,525
Speaker 7:  It's just a lot of really mundane things like missing emails except that

1106
01:09:08,715 --> 01:09:11,205
Speaker 6:  Well Delta wifi does suck, so I'm not

1107
01:09:11,205 --> 01:09:12,365
Speaker 4:  Surprised. It's really bad.

1108
01:09:12,745 --> 01:09:15,365
Speaker 6:  I'm not surprised that he missed an email. He's probably on one of his planes.

1109
01:09:15,725 --> 01:09:15,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

1110
01:09:16,015 --> 01:09:18,365
Speaker 4:  Delta wifi is horrible lately. Yeah, yeah,

1111
01:09:19,035 --> 01:09:22,565
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Actually it seemed like maybe the CEO was like flying to the

1112
01:09:22,845 --> 01:09:26,805
Speaker 7:  Olympics. Oh my god. So yeah, it, it definitely could be. Could be

1113
01:09:26,805 --> 01:09:27,605
Speaker 7:  the Delta wifi.

1114
01:09:29,105 --> 01:09:32,605
Speaker 4:  So CrowdStrike went down, Delta went down catastrophically

1115
01:09:32,905 --> 01:09:35,845
Speaker 4:  and then Ed Basian, who's the CEO of Delta, was on TN bbc. And he said, when

1116
01:09:35,845 --> 01:09:38,565
Speaker 4:  was the last time you heard of the big out at Apple? Which apparently just

1117
01:09:38,565 --> 01:09:42,485
Speaker 4:  made everyone mad. Like everyone got except for Apple. I think Apple is

1118
01:09:42,565 --> 01:09:46,525
Speaker 4:  thrilled to hear that. And so Microsoft sent this letter and

1119
01:09:46,675 --> 01:09:49,605
Speaker 4:  they're like, our software didn't cause your problem.

1120
01:09:49,995 --> 01:09:53,325
Speaker 4:  CrowdStrike did. And CrowdStrike is kinda like,

1121
01:09:53,655 --> 01:09:57,405
Speaker 4:  don't we're, can you guys fight? Yeah. It's all very good.

1122
01:09:59,225 --> 01:10:02,325
Speaker 4:  And they keep saying they've been offering to help Delta. Delta apparently

1123
01:10:02,325 --> 01:10:03,965
Speaker 4:  had it worse. Like other airlines came back faster.

1124
01:10:04,515 --> 01:10:07,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah, Delta was like days later they were

1125
01:10:07,915 --> 01:10:10,565
Speaker 5:  canceling. Like they just canceled their

1126
01:10:11,315 --> 01:10:14,805
Speaker 5:  unaccompanied minor program during all of this. They were like,

1127
01:10:15,115 --> 01:10:18,485
Speaker 5:  yeah minors you just don't travel anymore. And so kids were like stranded

1128
01:10:18,485 --> 01:10:22,045
Speaker 5:  in random airports and stuff. They shit the bed

1129
01:10:22,745 --> 01:10:25,085
Speaker 5:  and and are looking for someone to blame.

1130
01:10:26,035 --> 01:10:29,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So Microsoft is saying Delta has apparently not modernized its

1131
01:10:29,965 --> 01:10:32,605
Speaker 4:  IT infrastructure. And that said is rapidly becoming apparent that Delta

1132
01:10:32,605 --> 01:10:35,445
Speaker 4:  likely refused Microsoft help because the IT system is having most trouble

1133
01:10:35,685 --> 01:10:39,405
Speaker 4:  storing crew tracking and scheduling was being serviced by other providers

1134
01:10:39,405 --> 01:10:43,125
Speaker 4:  such as IBMs. and it is like I've never seen

1135
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:47,325
Speaker 4:  an IT vendor look at a client and be like, no it's

1136
01:10:47,325 --> 01:10:48,325
Speaker 4:  you. Absolutely not. This

1137
01:10:48,325 --> 01:10:51,725
Speaker 6:  Is your fault. Well didn't South, was it Southwest not impacted because they

1138
01:10:51,725 --> 01:10:53,765
Speaker 6:  were still running on like such an old version of

1139
01:10:53,765 --> 01:10:56,565
Speaker 4:  Windows? No, that's a meme that's right up there with JD Vance on the couch.

1140
01:10:56,635 --> 01:10:59,045
Speaker 4:  It's like, it's so good you don't wanna check it. You know. Wait,

1141
01:10:59,225 --> 01:11:00,685
Speaker 6:  JD Vance on the couch isn't reel

1142
01:11:01,905 --> 01:11:05,565
Speaker 4:  Damnit? It's like it's, it's like there's a long list of two good to check

1143
01:11:05,745 --> 01:11:09,205
Speaker 4:  and Southwest wasn't affected 'cause it's running. Unlike Windows three is

1144
01:11:09,205 --> 01:11:10,205
Speaker 4:  like right up there.

1145
01:11:10,785 --> 01:11:11,565
Speaker 6:  You just ruined my

1146
01:11:11,565 --> 01:11:15,525
Speaker 4:  Week. I'm sorry. That's fine. Southwest is great. Alright Alex,

1147
01:11:15,525 --> 01:11:17,525
Speaker 4:  what's yours? Heath, what's your lightning around?

1148
01:11:18,075 --> 01:11:21,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so mine is a great scoop that Kylie had on the site about Humane,

1149
01:11:22,285 --> 01:11:26,165
Speaker 6:  a company that we obviously have been obsessively chronicling since the

1150
01:11:26,165 --> 01:11:30,045
Speaker 6:  dirt disastrous debut of its AI pin. She found out

1151
01:11:30,095 --> 01:11:33,965
Speaker 6:  based on some internal sales data that she got that more pins are

1152
01:11:33,965 --> 01:11:36,205
Speaker 6:  being returned than sold. That's

1153
01:11:36,205 --> 01:11:36,845
Speaker 4:  Very good. Which

1154
01:11:37,905 --> 01:11:41,645
Speaker 6:  I'm not running a hardware business, but I think that's bad.

1155
01:11:41,995 --> 01:11:45,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And the piece is great. She's got a lot of color.

1156
01:11:46,325 --> 01:11:49,045
Speaker 6:  I just wanna call out Humane spokesperson,

1157
01:11:50,255 --> 01:11:53,605
Speaker 6:  Zoe's Zos K's statement to us

1158
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:57,725
Speaker 6:  where she said we do not comment on financial data but we'll

1159
01:11:57,725 --> 01:12:00,845
Speaker 6:  refer it to our legal counsel. Okay. And

1160
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:05,205
Speaker 6:  it's just ridiculous. It's a ridiculous response to a story like this. But

1161
01:12:05,785 --> 01:12:09,165
Speaker 6:  Humane is very much on the defensive. There's

1162
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:13,205
Speaker 6:  talks, rumors of them, you know, trying to sell themselves to hp.

1163
01:12:13,555 --> 01:12:17,405
Speaker 6:  They raised over $200 million and sold 9 million worth of product ish.

1164
01:12:17,705 --> 01:12:19,645
Speaker 6:  So not good for them. And

1165
01:12:19,645 --> 01:12:23,325
Speaker 4:  Wait, if you do the math at $9 million at whatever that the pin was 700 bucks.

1166
01:12:23,425 --> 01:12:24,925
Speaker 4:  So they sold like 12,000 units.

1167
01:12:25,795 --> 01:12:28,005
Speaker 6:  They wanted to sell a hundred thousand in the first year.

1168
01:12:28,005 --> 01:12:31,245
Speaker 4:  Right. So he sold like 12,000 and I think Harley has it. There's only 7,000

1169
01:12:31,245 --> 01:12:35,125
Speaker 4:  left in the wild. Yeah, yeah. That's bad. That's just generally bad if you

1170
01:12:35,135 --> 01:12:38,205
Speaker 6:  Those have one, you should save it and put it in a box. It's gonna be a great,

1171
01:12:38,685 --> 01:12:39,885
Speaker 6:  honestly it'll be a great collector's item

1172
01:12:40,025 --> 01:12:43,005
Speaker 5:  If you have one and have it returned it and actually use it. Just, just hit

1173
01:12:43,005 --> 01:12:46,885
Speaker 5:  me up. I wanna know everything about you. I wanna understand

1174
01:12:46,885 --> 01:12:47,405
Speaker 5:  your world

1175
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:50,325
Speaker 4:  Somewhere right now and can't be, Sam is touching their pin and being like,

1176
01:12:50,335 --> 01:12:53,565
Speaker 4:  email Alex. Alex email Alex.

1177
01:12:54,115 --> 01:12:55,245
Speaker 5:  Nope. No the pin's on fire.

1178
01:12:56,885 --> 01:13:00,605
Speaker 4:  Oh that was the other thing Holly. This piece, which I think is one of

1179
01:13:00,665 --> 01:13:04,245
Speaker 4:  the worst pieces of the puzzle. They haven't figured out how to

1180
01:13:04,445 --> 01:13:08,085
Speaker 4:  refurbish the pins. Yeah. Because some limitation with T-Mobile, which I'm

1181
01:13:08,085 --> 01:13:12,045
Speaker 4:  guessing is related to repro provisioning the eim inside the

1182
01:13:12,065 --> 01:13:15,205
Speaker 4:  pin. So they're just stuck with this and they hope they can figure it out.

1183
01:13:16,545 --> 01:13:19,645
Speaker 4:  We just bad all around. I will say to to Heath's point,

1184
01:13:22,755 --> 01:13:26,405
Speaker 4:  once you tell, once you start waving lawyers at me, I've learned something

1185
01:13:26,405 --> 01:13:26,765
Speaker 4:  about you.

1186
01:13:27,325 --> 01:13:28,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1187
01:13:28,345 --> 01:13:28,765
Speaker 4:  I'm not gonna say

1188
01:13:28,835 --> 01:13:29,645
Speaker 6:  It's the ultimate tell.

1189
01:13:29,915 --> 01:13:32,565
Speaker 4:  It's the ultimate tell. Yeah. It's just like, it's like, oh, oh I, I know

1190
01:13:32,565 --> 01:13:36,375
Speaker 4:  something. And we, we do this a lot people, a lot of lawyers have

1191
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:39,495
Speaker 4:  emailed me The Verge still exists. That's all I'm gonna say.

1192
01:13:40,705 --> 01:13:44,615
Speaker 4:  We're, we're better at it than you might think. Alright, I'm

1193
01:13:44,615 --> 01:13:47,015
Speaker 4:  gonna talk. Can I, can I quickly talk about the TV competition?

1194
01:13:47,525 --> 01:13:47,895
Speaker 5:  Tell us

1195
01:13:47,895 --> 01:13:50,695
Speaker 4:  Everything. A story that I didn't write a thing that no one knows that I

1196
01:13:50,695 --> 01:13:54,255
Speaker 4:  did. There's a very famous TV store

1197
01:13:54,635 --> 01:13:58,135
Speaker 4:  in Westchester, New York called Value Electronics. They've been doing it

1198
01:13:58,135 --> 01:14:01,935
Speaker 4:  forever. They sell a million TVs Robert's on the guy who owns it,

1199
01:14:02,035 --> 01:14:05,335
Speaker 4:  he runs it with his family. It's just a little mom and pop and they sell

1200
01:14:05,335 --> 01:14:08,895
Speaker 4:  more high-end TVs than anyone like Sony allocates, high-end

1201
01:14:09,115 --> 01:14:13,045
Speaker 4:  TVs to this one store. And so every year they run and he's a

1202
01:14:13,045 --> 01:14:15,965
Speaker 4:  former broadcast engineer. So every year they run this thing called the TV

1203
01:14:15,965 --> 01:14:19,325
Speaker 4:  shootout. They've been doing it for 20 years and like literally like

1204
01:14:19,785 --> 01:14:23,565
Speaker 4:  com, the CEO of compression houses and like

1205
01:14:23,745 --> 01:14:27,685
Speaker 4:  the head colorist for movie studios, like a Warner Brothers discovery

1206
01:14:27,705 --> 01:14:31,405
Speaker 4:  and coding person is like, they're the judges. They have

1207
01:14:31,405 --> 01:14:34,885
Speaker 4:  master calibrators come and calibrate all these TVs. Beautiful. And then

1208
01:14:34,885 --> 01:14:38,845
Speaker 4:  there was me, 'cause I'm a consumer reviewer, which is great. So I was like

1209
01:14:38,845 --> 01:14:42,365
Speaker 4:  honored to do this. I felt completely outta my depth. I think my scores were

1210
01:14:42,365 --> 01:14:45,605
Speaker 4:  in line with everyone else. And I will write this up over the weekend, but

1211
01:14:45,605 --> 01:14:49,565
Speaker 4:  I will say one my my tv, the one I bought, the Sony 8 95,

1212
01:14:50,265 --> 01:14:50,725
Speaker 4:  it won.

1213
01:14:51,265 --> 01:14:52,565
Speaker 5:  Yay. Congratulations.

1214
01:14:52,865 --> 01:14:56,845
Speaker 4:  One, I was the winner. And then the mini L led D TVs, I think

1215
01:14:56,845 --> 01:15:00,205
Speaker 4:  I said micro LED earlier. But the mini LED D TVs, the new Bravia nine,

1216
01:15:00,975 --> 01:15:04,205
Speaker 4:  there was a Samsung one, there's an LG one, they're not even in the running

1217
01:15:04,225 --> 01:15:07,845
Speaker 4:  yet. You can just obviously tell like they're gonna get there.

1218
01:15:08,665 --> 01:15:12,485
Speaker 4:  But there's so much more to go on the mini LED side before they

1219
01:15:12,485 --> 01:15:16,125
Speaker 4:  compete with the OLEDs. The OLEDs were just like, it was like a, a sigh of

1220
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:19,365
Speaker 4:  relief going and looking at the eds after the mini LEDs that, so I'll write

1221
01:15:19,365 --> 01:15:23,325
Speaker 4:  all this up. But it was fascinating to be a judge in a

1222
01:15:23,325 --> 01:15:27,245
Speaker 4:  TV picture quality con like first of all, I was in heaven, like

1223
01:15:27,395 --> 01:15:31,045
Speaker 4:  pure heaven, just joy for two days I did nothing but look at

1224
01:15:31,305 --> 01:15:34,885
Speaker 4:  TVs with other TV nerds and talk about things like posturization

1225
01:15:35,345 --> 01:15:36,685
Speaker 4:  in like fields of color.

1226
01:15:37,225 --> 01:15:40,245
Speaker 5:  Did people who, who, who brought the like color perimeter? Did anybody bus

1227
01:15:40,245 --> 01:15:40,525
Speaker 5:  it out?

1228
01:15:41,785 --> 01:15:45,725
Speaker 4:  The, so the, we were, I gotta write about this, but

1229
01:15:45,985 --> 01:15:48,285
Speaker 4:  we were judging the tv. It wasn't a subjective

1230
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:49,125
Speaker 5:  Okay.

1231
01:15:49,735 --> 01:15:53,285
Speaker 4:  Evaluation. They had $40,000 Sony reference

1232
01:15:53,285 --> 01:15:57,165
Speaker 4:  monitors. Yes. By each bank of three TVs. Oh my gosh. And

1233
01:15:57,265 --> 01:16:00,885
Speaker 4:  the, the judging was how much the TVs were

1234
01:16:00,885 --> 01:16:04,485
Speaker 4:  deviation. How big of a deviation from the reference monitor those TVs were.

1235
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:06,125
Speaker 5:  Oh, so of course the Sony won,

1236
01:16:06,455 --> 01:16:09,325
Speaker 4:  Right? 'cause it was a Sony reference. I was, does the Sony look like it's

1237
01:16:09,325 --> 01:16:12,485
Speaker 4:  own Sony reference monitor? But the, the reference monitors were like, this

1238
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:16,405
Speaker 4:  is what the mastering people wanted the movie

1239
01:16:16,425 --> 01:16:19,565
Speaker 4:  to look like or wanted the content to look like. And then if you calibrate

1240
01:16:19,565 --> 01:16:22,245
Speaker 4:  the TVs, how closely can you calibrate the TV to the reference,

1241
01:16:22,835 --> 01:16:23,605
Speaker 5:  This is what I want.

1242
01:16:23,605 --> 01:16:27,085
Speaker 4:  So it's not like a what looks better totally subjective thing. It was how

1243
01:16:27,085 --> 01:16:30,685
Speaker 4:  close is this to the reference, which made it like a very

1244
01:16:30,685 --> 01:16:34,605
Speaker 4:  different kind of exercise. And then obviously everyone's like a huge nerd.

1245
01:16:34,605 --> 01:16:38,325
Speaker 4:  Like people were up there like staring at pixels and like

1246
01:16:38,365 --> 01:16:41,365
Speaker 4:  intently and we had to be reminded. The judges were like, you can't collude.

1247
01:16:42,725 --> 01:16:46,565
Speaker 4:  I was like purely in heaven. No antitrust here for two

1248
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:47,365
Speaker 4:  days over a weekend.

1249
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:50,485
Speaker 5:  How many times did you have to watch Harry Potter

1250
01:16:51,025 --> 01:16:55,005
Speaker 4:  Or Avatar? Oh man. So we watched a movie called Dr.

1251
01:16:55,015 --> 01:16:59,005
Speaker 4:  Sleep several times, which is insane. So you had to find things like we

1252
01:16:59,005 --> 01:17:02,645
Speaker 4:  were judging things like low light performance, right? Or fast

1253
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:06,725
Speaker 4:  SDR motion or like bright high HDR sports. So they had to

1254
01:17:06,725 --> 01:17:10,565
Speaker 4:  find clips to play. All of the clips were being

1255
01:17:10,665 --> 01:17:14,285
Speaker 4:  run off an oppo Blu-ray player. I'm

1256
01:17:14,285 --> 01:17:14,485
Speaker 5:  So happy

1257
01:17:14,745 --> 01:17:18,125
Speaker 4:  Out of you. Or off or off. A Kaleido escape, which is really high bit rate.

1258
01:17:18,195 --> 01:17:21,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Streaming. So all the, there were all these like specific

1259
01:17:21,895 --> 01:17:25,885
Speaker 4:  clips that were there to show like specific things

1260
01:17:25,885 --> 01:17:28,405
Speaker 4:  that we were to judge. And I had like

1261
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:33,525
Speaker 4:  60 numbers per sheet and there were like four sheets

1262
01:17:33,905 --> 01:17:37,725
Speaker 4:  of scores and it was, it was a 10 point scale and I was like,

1263
01:17:37,855 --> 01:17:41,805
Speaker 4:  world of no sevens, like the whole thing. It was great.

1264
01:17:42,145 --> 01:17:44,925
Speaker 4:  The Sony You can go look at the press release. You can see the scores. The

1265
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:48,765
Speaker 4:  Sony won, the LG G four came in second more or less

1266
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:53,165
Speaker 4:  and the Samsung came in third in the Eds and then the, the mini Sony Mini,

1267
01:17:53,195 --> 01:17:57,085
Speaker 4:  they came in first in mini these. So the scores are public. I'm not revealing

1268
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:59,565
Speaker 4:  anything. You can just go look at that press release. I will write up the

1269
01:17:59,565 --> 01:18:03,485
Speaker 4:  whole thing 'cause there's more to say. But I have to say like, I thought

1270
01:18:03,525 --> 01:18:07,325
Speaker 4:  I was gonna spend this week arguing about TV stuff with people and I super

1271
01:18:07,425 --> 01:18:11,005
Speaker 4:  did it. I was very much distracted by other stuff, but I had the time in

1272
01:18:11,005 --> 01:18:13,325
Speaker 4:  my life. It was really fun to be a judge. I hope I get to do it again next

1273
01:18:13,325 --> 01:18:17,285
Speaker 4:  year. And yeah, I'm like, I

1274
01:18:17,525 --> 01:18:21,485
Speaker 4:  I and I, the interesting thing is the, the

1275
01:18:21,485 --> 01:18:25,045
Speaker 4:  head room for those many ladies to get as good as OLEDs is obvious, but it's,

1276
01:18:25,045 --> 01:18:27,765
Speaker 4:  it's nowhere close. Like yeah. Not even in the same ballpark.

1277
01:18:27,905 --> 01:18:31,605
Speaker 5:  Was it the brightness and just like that, that that difference in the

1278
01:18:31,605 --> 01:18:35,125
Speaker 4:  Range? No, it's like, it's called, I mean they're LCD TVs. Yeah. So they're

1279
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:37,685
Speaker 4:  still, they're, they're like washed out. The colors are all wrong. Like the

1280
01:18:37,835 --> 01:18:41,085
Speaker 4:  LCDs are all pinker than the OLEDs. It's, it's like bananas.

1281
01:18:42,205 --> 01:18:45,245
Speaker 4:  I will post up my scores, like my, my score sheets. There's lots.

1282
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:47,725
Speaker 5:  I'm like, Mila, I just want you to file this story. I just really wanna read

1283
01:18:47,725 --> 01:18:48,085
Speaker 5:  that story.

1284
01:18:48,085 --> 01:18:50,685
Speaker 4:  That's what I thought I was gonna do this weekend. I had to read PDFs all

1285
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:50,965
Speaker 4:  day long.

1286
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:53,605
Speaker 5:  Please no one else release a major lawsuit.

1287
01:18:53,725 --> 01:18:56,805
Speaker 4:  I started in this whole career to not be a lawyer and to look at TVs all

1288
01:18:56,805 --> 01:18:57,925
Speaker 4:  day long. No

1289
01:18:57,925 --> 01:19:00,805
Speaker 5:  More lawsuits we're done for the week. Yeah.

1290
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:04,285
Speaker 4:  Also Justice for the Frame tv. I'm really stunned. The Frame TV was not even

1291
01:19:04,465 --> 01:19:07,925
Speaker 4:  in the picture. Like I brought up the frame TV with a bunch of people. Oh,

1292
01:19:08,325 --> 01:19:11,445
Speaker 4:  the manufacturers all had representatives there. So I met a bunch of very

1293
01:19:11,445 --> 01:19:15,085
Speaker 4:  nice like Sony engineers and product managers and all the companies were

1294
01:19:15,085 --> 01:19:18,165
Speaker 4:  there. And I kept asking like, do you think the Frame TV is a harbinger of

1295
01:19:18,165 --> 01:19:22,045
Speaker 4:  doom? And they'd be like, no, no comment. I don't Who are you? You a professional

1296
01:19:22,045 --> 01:19:22,885
Speaker 4:  color? Calibrator.

1297
01:19:23,155 --> 01:19:24,685
Speaker 5:  Well there we got more of 'em now

1298
01:19:25,225 --> 01:19:29,205
Speaker 4:  We yeah, there's, there's a competition for the Frame TV from who is it?

1299
01:19:29,205 --> 01:19:29,485
Speaker 4:  Is it

1300
01:19:29,495 --> 01:19:33,245
Speaker 5:  Sense? It's tcl, L and Hisense. So like, like race

1301
01:19:33,305 --> 01:19:37,265
Speaker 5:  to the bottom on tv. Quality there real,

1302
01:19:37,265 --> 01:19:38,025
Speaker 5:  no disrespects

1303
01:19:38,025 --> 01:19:41,185
Speaker 4:  A real, it's a real something. TCL and a high sense by the way opted out

1304
01:19:41,185 --> 01:19:44,585
Speaker 4:  of the competition. They declined to participate, which is pretty good.

1305
01:19:45,525 --> 01:19:47,025
Speaker 4:  All right, Kranz, what's your lightning round?

1306
01:19:47,485 --> 01:19:51,145
Speaker 5:  All right, so my, my lightning round is Chromecast is dead but Chromecast

1307
01:19:51,165 --> 01:19:55,105
Speaker 5:  is not dead. Just the dongle is dead. I, I saw there was

1308
01:19:55,105 --> 01:19:58,505
Speaker 5:  some confusion out there in the world. Chromecast is like the protocol that

1309
01:19:58,505 --> 01:20:02,105
Speaker 5:  You can go and like cast things to your TV or whatever that still lives.

1310
01:20:03,085 --> 01:20:05,305
Speaker 5:  The little dongles are gone. They're done.

1311
01:20:05,935 --> 01:20:09,325
Speaker 4:  It's all over. It's they're all over. It's the picture we have in our Chromecast

1312
01:20:09,345 --> 01:20:13,285
Speaker 4:  has gone is a picture I took of the first generation Chromecast in

1313
01:20:13,285 --> 01:20:16,885
Speaker 4:  2013 plugged into my pioneer crow. And in the background

1314
01:20:17,385 --> 01:20:21,085
Speaker 4:  You can see my three component cables plugged into it because it was 10 years

1315
01:20:21,105 --> 01:20:22,485
Speaker 4:  ago component.

1316
01:20:22,505 --> 01:20:22,925
Speaker 5:  Pretty

1317
01:20:22,925 --> 01:20:26,845
Speaker 4:  Rule. Pretty sure my cable box was plugged in with RCA cables by a component.

1318
01:20:27,515 --> 01:20:28,645
Speaker 4:  It's very good. It's

1319
01:20:28,645 --> 01:20:29,005
Speaker 5:  Very good.

1320
01:20:29,635 --> 01:20:33,605
Speaker 4:  It's kind of it, you know the Google's whole idea with the Chromecast

1321
01:20:33,665 --> 01:20:36,765
Speaker 4:  was you, you're just gonna use your phone to watch video and send it to a

1322
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:36,965
Speaker 4:  TV.

1323
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:38,445
Speaker 5:  And we all realized that sucked.

1324
01:20:38,955 --> 01:20:41,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah it didn't work. And then the TVs all have the software in it and the

1325
01:20:41,965 --> 01:20:45,765
Speaker 4:  new streamer box. Alex, I'm very curious for your

1326
01:20:45,765 --> 01:20:49,485
Speaker 4:  perspective on this. They told Chris Welch that their North Star, what they

1327
01:20:49,485 --> 01:20:51,645
Speaker 4:  were competing with is the Nvidia Shield.

1328
01:20:52,075 --> 01:20:55,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah, look, we love to rip on the Nvidia Shield. I

1329
01:20:55,805 --> 01:20:59,565
Speaker 5:  personally still use the Apple TV myself, but the

1330
01:20:59,565 --> 01:21:03,485
Speaker 5:  Nvidia Shield is the most powerful step top box. It is the highest quality.

1331
01:21:03,785 --> 01:21:07,445
Speaker 5:  It is the one that like if they had been using a streaming box at the

1332
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:11,005
Speaker 5:  shootout Neil I went to, that's what they would've been using. They use Apple

1333
01:21:11,005 --> 01:21:11,205
Speaker 5:  tv.

1334
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:11,765
Speaker 4:  I just wanna be

1335
01:21:11,765 --> 01:21:14,805
Speaker 5:  Very clear about. But Apple TV is, that's the one that installers all like

1336
01:21:14,805 --> 01:21:17,845
Speaker 5:  to use because that's what the clients board prefer. Yes. So those are two,

1337
01:21:17,845 --> 01:21:21,725
Speaker 5:  like the two. So like chasing the Nvidia Shield is

1338
01:21:21,725 --> 01:21:25,485
Speaker 5:  awesome. The Nvidia Shield could probably do to chase itself a little. 'cause

1339
01:21:25,485 --> 01:21:29,365
Speaker 5:  I don't think it's had an update in like two years, but it's like, it also

1340
01:21:29,425 --> 01:21:30,925
Speaker 4:  Is like, I think Nvidia has different priorities

1341
01:21:30,925 --> 01:21:34,285
Speaker 5:  Now. Yeah, right now they're like, we're just gonna like generate buckets

1342
01:21:34,285 --> 01:21:36,525
Speaker 5:  of money with ai. We don't care about these little, if

1343
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:40,325
Speaker 4:  We ever, I Jensen Wang decoder, I'm gonna be like Jensen

1344
01:21:40,325 --> 01:21:44,165
Speaker 4:  Wong. If we ever new Jensen Wong a decoder, I'm be like, AI, whatever.

1345
01:21:44,195 --> 01:21:47,365
Speaker 4:  Tell me about your plans for the Nvidia shoot. And then we're gonna see if

1346
01:21:47,365 --> 01:21:48,565
Speaker 4:  he even knows it exists.

1347
01:21:49,075 --> 01:21:52,165
Speaker 5:  He's just gonna be like pocket sand, throw it at you and like disappear out

1348
01:21:52,165 --> 01:21:53,965
Speaker 5:  of frame. Just absolutely not

1349
01:21:54,265 --> 01:21:57,925
Speaker 4:  Run away. Oh Alex, I gotta tell you, one of the tests we did

1350
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:02,085
Speaker 4:  at the TV shootout was an A TSC 3.0 Yes. We watched the

1351
01:22:02,445 --> 01:22:05,685
Speaker 4:  Olympics broadcast from NBC New York in 10 80

1352
01:22:05,885 --> 01:22:09,725
Speaker 4:  PHDR to something called the Zapper Box. Like a tuner

1353
01:22:09,745 --> 01:22:13,485
Speaker 4:  box with Atmos audio. It was like ba bare, like barely compressed 'cause

1354
01:22:13,485 --> 01:22:17,045
Speaker 4:  it was just full quality broadcast. It looked incredible. Yeah.

1355
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:20,085
Speaker 4:  I was like, I gotta get an antenna. And I was like, no, I don't, you

1356
01:22:20,085 --> 01:22:20,405
Speaker 5:  Don't need money.

1357
01:22:20,525 --> 01:22:21,765
Speaker 4:  I truly do not have to get antenna.

1358
01:22:21,765 --> 01:22:25,685
Speaker 5:  That's the only station and, and you won't get, you won't get any joy out

1359
01:22:25,685 --> 01:22:26,805
Speaker 5:  of it once the Olympics are over.

1360
01:22:27,165 --> 01:22:30,965
Speaker 4:  There was a very funny mis like miscommunication moment where I was like,

1361
01:22:30,965 --> 01:22:34,925
Speaker 4:  where is this coming from? And someone very earnestly was like, it's in

1362
01:22:34,925 --> 01:22:37,645
Speaker 4:  Paris. I was like, no, that's not what I meant at all.

1363
01:22:39,465 --> 01:22:43,325
Speaker 4:  Bon sure. I was like, no, I at what station? It's bro fine. Whatever

1364
01:22:44,165 --> 01:22:48,005
Speaker 4:  it was very good. Alright, we are way over. I'm sorry that we talked

1365
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:51,245
Speaker 4:  about Elon Musk, but he's not good at knowing what a contract

1366
01:23:26,245 --> 01:23:29,845
Speaker 8:  Network. Our show is produced by Andrew Marino and Liam James.

1367
01:23:30,185 --> 01:23:31,645
Speaker 8:  That's it. We'll see you next week.
