Description: Peak Evernote was roughly a decade ago. Since then, the product has often felt stagnant (or worse), the company churned through executives and business plans, and it seemed like Evernote was slowly turning into a zombie app. Not gone, not even forgotten, just sort of... there. For the third and final installment in our series about productivity and digital life, we sit down with Federico Simionato, the Evernote product lead at Bending Spoons. We talk about the acquisition process, how he perceives Evernote in today’s landscape, what it took to start shipping new stuff again, why Bending Spoons changed the subscription price, and much more.

00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:41,925
Speaker 3:  it's coming a couple of weeks late. Won't happen again. We've been looking

3
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:46,045
Speaker 3:  into how people work in this series and how we

4
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:49,925
Speaker 3:  should work, and really not even just work, we're just trying to

5
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,765
Speaker 3:  find ways to be more functional, sane,

6
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:57,325
Speaker 3:  useful people in our digital lives. The more we do this, the more I'm hating

7
00:00:57,325 --> 00:01:00,525
Speaker 3:  the term productivity, but it's kind of the best way we have to talk about

8
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:04,485
Speaker 3:  this. For this last episode, we're gonna talk about one of the all

9
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:08,365
Speaker 3:  time iconic productivity apps, Evernote. My

10
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:12,325
Speaker 3:  guest today is Federico Sato, who now leads work on Evernote for a company

11
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:16,285
Speaker 3:  called Bending Spoons. But before we get into all of that, let me just quickly

12
00:01:16,315 --> 00:01:20,285
Speaker 3:  give you the brief Evernote story. Evernote has been around for more

13
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:23,965
Speaker 3:  than two decades, but I think most people probably heard of it. Around

14
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:27,925
Speaker 3:  2008 when the app launched in the very first

15
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:31,525
Speaker 3:  version of Apple's iPhone app store. That was a huge deal.

16
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:35,445
Speaker 3:  Being in the store at the beginning was a big win for basically

17
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:39,165
Speaker 3:  every app that was in there. So Evernote blew up and it became one of the

18
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,765
Speaker 3:  biggest productivity apps on the planet. The biggest number

19
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,645
Speaker 3:  I've seen was that in 2014 there were a hundred million people

20
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:49,925
Speaker 3:  using Evernote. I was one of them, by the way, and I loved

21
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:53,925
Speaker 3:  Evernote many, many years ago. Back when I was in college, I actually did

22
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:57,725
Speaker 3:  some freelance work for the company, and I was a devoted user of

23
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:01,565
Speaker 3:  Evernote for years. It was fast, it was cross platform

24
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:04,965
Speaker 3:  back when that was kind of a rare thing to be. It had a really great web

25
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:08,365
Speaker 3:  clipper that made it easy to get stuff into the app. You could email into

26
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:12,205
Speaker 3:  it. It was just great. It was like a digital filing cabinet. It just had

27
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:15,845
Speaker 3:  all my stuff. I loved it very much, but Evernote never quite

28
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:19,805
Speaker 3:  figured out how to keep going or where to go next

29
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:24,365
Speaker 3:  when it was really popular. Around that same time, it had this weird

30
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:28,165
Speaker 3:  diversion into being a lifestyle company, selling socks and

31
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:31,925
Speaker 3:  notebooks and all kinds of stuff. It was like Evernote wanted to be Nike

32
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:36,125
Speaker 3:  for nerds. It was very strange. The company also started making other

33
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,885
Speaker 3:  apps like a scanner app and the image editing app Skitch and

34
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:43,085
Speaker 3:  generally just seemed like it kind of lost track of what it was actually

35
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:47,085
Speaker 3:  for. Meanwhile, the app got bloated and slow. The company

36
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:51,245
Speaker 3:  tried to kind of pivot to being a B2B app for people

37
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:55,125
Speaker 3:  at work. Multiple CEOs came in and tried to reboot the whole

38
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,325
Speaker 3:  thing, but never quite figured it out, and Evernote just seemed like it was

39
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,445
Speaker 3:  slowly dying. One of those apps that's still around

40
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:06,325
Speaker 3:  but stops getting better and just kind of slowly gets worse forever and

41
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:10,125
Speaker 3:  ever and ever. Then in late 2022, Evernote was acquired

42
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:14,085
Speaker 3:  by bending spoons, which seemed odd. Bending Spoons is a kind

43
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:17,765
Speaker 3:  of mix of tech incubator and private

44
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:21,565
Speaker 3:  equity company. Basically, it buys products, integrates them all together

45
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:25,445
Speaker 3:  and tries to find ways to do things more efficiently. Basically,

46
00:03:25,465 --> 00:03:28,565
Speaker 3:  by having them all in one company, you can share some resources

47
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:32,725
Speaker 3:  and in theory then devote more resources just to the products.

48
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:36,525
Speaker 3:  Anyway, a few months after the acquisition bending spoons announced that

49
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:40,285
Speaker 3:  it was laying off most of Evernote's staff and moving most of the company's

50
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:43,845
Speaker 3:  operations to Europe, which is where bending spoons is based. This is a pattern

51
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:47,045
Speaker 3:  for bending spoons. It does this with a lot of companies it buys, but at

52
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:50,645
Speaker 3:  this point I thought Evernote was dead for sure. I think most people did,

53
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:54,485
Speaker 3:  but that's not actually what happened. Evernote eventually started

54
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:58,765
Speaker 3:  shipping new stuff. It seemed to have a new identity about what it was

55
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:02,365
Speaker 3:  and what it was for, and for the first time, frankly, in a really long time,

56
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:06,605
Speaker 3:  the product started getting better. It also got a lot more expensive, which

57
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:10,325
Speaker 3:  made a lot of people really, really, really mad. But we're gonna get to that

58
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:14,205
Speaker 3:  in a minute. To start with, Federico, we just went back to the

59
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:17,965
Speaker 3:  beginning. He was an Evernote user himself for years and said he was psyched

60
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:21,485
Speaker 3:  to have the company on board at bending spoons. It sounds to me like bending

61
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:25,445
Speaker 3:  spoons was enticed by the combo of big brand, really popular

62
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:29,525
Speaker 3:  app, just something in need of some serious product love.

63
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:34,045
Speaker 3:  And as soon as they got the deal done, Federico and his team went to work.

64
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:38,565
Speaker 4:  I think the first, yeah, 12 months, maybe like 11 months were

65
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:42,325
Speaker 4:  just about technology, just about learning how

66
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:46,645
Speaker 4:  the backend worked or the client architecture worked and trying to

67
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:51,285
Speaker 4:  not rebuild it because we couldn't rebuild Evernote. You know, like, like

68
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:54,725
Speaker 4:  it's 20 years of software. We couldn't, we couldn't rebuild it all, but trying

69
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:57,725
Speaker 4:  to identify the most critical pieces and, and try to rewrite

70
00:04:57,725 --> 00:05:01,085
Speaker 3:  Those. And this is true of almost any app that age, right? Like, I feel like

71
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:03,805
Speaker 3:  this is a story you hear, it's just what's gonna happen. Yes, If, you are

72
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:07,485
Speaker 3:  building a thing in 2004 and then 2007 and then 2009, like

73
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:11,765
Speaker 3:  yeah, the world changes every 18 months and it's very

74
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:14,965
Speaker 3:  hard to keep up and So, I feel like anything of that kind of age

75
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,565
Speaker 3:  is going to have these sorts of

76
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:20,405
Speaker 4:  Problems. Yeah, definitely. Even something that you, right now, probably

77
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:23,445
Speaker 4:  in like 10 years, people are going to look at the code and say what they,

78
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:27,045
Speaker 4:  what were they think? Right. You know, and it's fair, it's fair, it's fine,

79
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:31,325
Speaker 4:  but it was super complex. And so one of the first things we did when we arrived

80
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:35,365
Speaker 4:  was to ship this huge project that the team already

81
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:38,645
Speaker 4:  started working on, which was called rt, like real time editing.

82
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:43,045
Speaker 4:  And it was about synchronizing the note content so that the content of a

83
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:46,885
Speaker 4:  single note instantaneously between devices, both your other devices

84
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:51,085
Speaker 4:  and devices of people, that they were also in the same note with you. And

85
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:55,045
Speaker 4:  you can see how this is like a completely different thing than what

86
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:58,565
Speaker 4:  Evernote used to be, or like the, you can imagine how

87
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:02,765
Speaker 4:  the, the way the note editor was built needed to change in order

88
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:06,445
Speaker 4:  to do this, to achieve this. And So I, I don't know how many, like months

89
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:10,365
Speaker 4:  and tens of people went into making it a reality, but we were able to to

90
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:14,205
Speaker 4:  ship it in the first few months. And today we just launched Rent, which is

91
00:06:14,205 --> 00:06:17,685
Speaker 4:  the other thing which we worked on since. So after

92
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:21,565
Speaker 4:  releasing rt, which is about synchronizing the note content, we started working

93
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:25,725
Speaker 4:  on rent, which is a project to synchronize the metadata. So

94
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:29,445
Speaker 4:  the, the note list, the, I dunno that even just the title, the snippet,

95
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:33,805
Speaker 4:  the preview, the time it was LA last edited, et cetera. Not

96
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:37,325
Speaker 4:  because I want to talk about that necessarily, but because you see how we

97
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:41,085
Speaker 4:  started working on it after RTE, and now we are done after

98
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:44,445
Speaker 4:  like more than a year. Right? So yeah, that's, that's the, that's the reason.

99
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:48,685
Speaker 4:  And the, the decision behind it is just can we improve it in a

100
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:52,605
Speaker 4:  way that it won't be a problem? Not anymore necessarily

101
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:56,245
Speaker 4:  like forever, but, but like, it's like something that we can actually touch

102
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:58,645
Speaker 4:  and, and we feel like we own. And

103
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:01,965
Speaker 3:  I, I would assume there's also a part of that process where you have to say

104
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:05,885
Speaker 3:  like, okay, it's not whatever, 2006

105
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:08,565
Speaker 3:  when Evernote first came out, I think it was around then, somewhere in there

106
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:12,845
Speaker 3:  the landscape has changed. Yeah. And it's a really different kind of world

107
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:16,245
Speaker 3:  to be in, and you're in a position of saying, not we want to take this kind

108
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:20,085
Speaker 3:  of old crusty app and like bleed it for

109
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:23,325
Speaker 3:  cash until it dies. Yeah. You're saying we wanna like, we wanna renovate

110
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:26,125
Speaker 3:  this thing and make it new and modern and, and forward looking. Yeah. Which

111
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,445
Speaker 3:  I would think also means you have to kind of sit down and say, what is the

112
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:33,405
Speaker 3:  job of an app like Evernote now as opposed to what it was then?

113
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:35,925
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And I'm curious, especially for you as somebody who had been using

114
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:39,765
Speaker 3:  the app for a long time, what is that process like? Like what, what were

115
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:41,845
Speaker 3:  you talking about when you were thinking about like, okay, what is the next

116
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:42,645
Speaker 3:  thing for Evernote to be?

117
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:46,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah, so there's a bunch of different things in that question. So the first

118
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:50,645
Speaker 4:  one is what does Evernote do? You know, what

119
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:54,285
Speaker 4:  I, what I understood by talking to, to customers is that they see

120
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:58,205
Speaker 4:  Evernote as a tool for individual note taking, that that's the core of what

121
00:07:58,205 --> 00:08:01,325
Speaker 4:  it does. So, so that people can organize their system. There's different

122
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:04,125
Speaker 4:  degrees of how organized you can be, but, but like generally, people who

123
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:08,165
Speaker 4:  who use such a software arb tend to be fairly organized and tend

124
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:12,045
Speaker 4:  to have like system of, of some sort. Sure. And, and, and it's

125
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:15,685
Speaker 4:  also interesting to see, to think about what it doesn't necessarily need

126
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:18,765
Speaker 4:  to do for, for the customers that, that are still like the millions of customers

127
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,885
Speaker 4:  that, that still use Evernote every week for instance. It doesn't do

128
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:26,125
Speaker 4:  a lot of like project management, especially collaborative project management.

129
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,685
Speaker 4:  They, they don't care about using Evernote for that. And, and so that's,

130
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:33,165
Speaker 4:  that's one part which already tells you what Evernote will not necessarily

131
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:37,005
Speaker 4:  try to be in the future. The other thing is where we think

132
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:40,885
Speaker 4:  Evernote is kind of failing at being the best and, and where we

133
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:44,325
Speaker 4:  think there is space and, and even just like market need

134
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:48,605
Speaker 4:  and customer necessity for such a tool. And I think that

135
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:51,885
Speaker 4:  collaboration, even though people will still see Evernote as an individual

136
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:56,285
Speaker 4:  note taking tool first, I still think that people would like forever Evernote

137
00:08:56,285 --> 00:09:00,125
Speaker 4:  to be better at like note sharing, collaborating real

138
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,685
Speaker 4:  time with people and, and stuff like that. And So, I, I'm excited to be working

139
00:09:03,685 --> 00:09:04,285
Speaker 4:  on that. Is

140
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:07,445
Speaker 3:  It, is it risky in that process to spend most of your time talking to people

141
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:11,205
Speaker 3:  who have been using Evernote? Like what's, what's the mix between

142
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:15,005
Speaker 3:  thinking about the people who are part of the product and thinking about

143
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:18,965
Speaker 3:  people who, for one reason or another have not used it, but you'd

144
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:21,645
Speaker 3:  like to Yeah. Like who, who do you think about in those early days?

145
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:25,725
Speaker 4:  Well, we, we think mostly about existing customers.

146
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:29,685
Speaker 4:  Okay. That's our main focus just because there are so many. And,

147
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:33,645
Speaker 4:  and so we definitely don't, don't want to piss them off. Then if we can add

148
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:37,405
Speaker 4:  something to Evernet that makes it better for both them and new

149
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:41,365
Speaker 4:  customers, that's great. But yeah, I, I don't think we will want to like,

150
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:45,005
Speaker 4:  make Evernet worse for, for people who are there in the hope that we can,

151
00:09:45,195 --> 00:09:49,125
Speaker 4:  that we can add some use case that maybe is enticing to somebody else. Okay.

152
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:49,565
Speaker 4:  That's

153
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:53,165
Speaker 3:  A tricky balance though. 'cause I think about it is like we, we've had Microsoft

154
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:56,805
Speaker 3:  executives tell us before that one of the hard things about building for

155
00:09:56,995 --> 00:10:00,845
Speaker 3:  Word or Excel is that If, you remove a feature that

156
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:04,165
Speaker 3:  you know 1% of people use, that's still 10 million people who use it and

157
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:07,205
Speaker 3:  love it and rely on it for work. And it's the most important thing in their

158
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:10,965
Speaker 3:  lives. And Evernote, I think, and really any tool

159
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:14,565
Speaker 3:  like it, people are like pouring their most important stuff

160
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:18,045
Speaker 3:  into it. Yes. And so If, you mess with it, even in the service of making

161
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:21,765
Speaker 3:  it ostensibly better, you're gonna screw up some

162
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:24,805
Speaker 3:  percentage of people's workflows and lives. Yeah. And

163
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:28,165
Speaker 3:  there's nothing you can do that will satisfy everybody.

164
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:32,365
Speaker 4:  I definitely felt the responsibility initially. Like I, I, I saw that people

165
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:36,005
Speaker 4:  understandably like, like empathize with them when, when somebody acquires

166
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:39,765
Speaker 4:  your, the tool that you use like multiple hours per day every day in a week.

167
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:44,285
Speaker 4:  I mean, you're, you're kind of in a, in a scary situation, you

168
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:47,845
Speaker 4:  know? So So I definitely empathize with them. When we first joined, when

169
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:51,045
Speaker 4:  we first arrived, some people in the team I think told me something like,

170
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:55,045
Speaker 4:  ANOT has a 5% problem, which like in a very

171
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:59,245
Speaker 4:  simplified way means that every feature is used at least by 5%

172
00:10:59,545 --> 00:11:02,965
Speaker 4:  of the people. It's not like technically true, but like, it lets you understand

173
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:06,925
Speaker 4:  how complex it is to think about ever not with the thousand things it

174
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:10,845
Speaker 4:  can do. Right. Will, will, while everything that it does is a,

175
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:13,085
Speaker 4:  is used by a non-negligible amount of, of people.

176
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,565
Speaker 3:  So do you then have to just get to the point where you're, you're comfortable

177
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:19,925
Speaker 3:  pissing off 5% of users at a time because it's kind of inevitable. I

178
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:23,645
Speaker 4:  Mean, you try not to Yeah. In some, so for fortunately it

179
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:27,445
Speaker 4:  wasn't 5%, there were some things that were used by, by fewer than 5% of

180
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:31,325
Speaker 4:  people. So we, we were able to do some simplification. So for instance,

181
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:35,285
Speaker 4:  we, we removed the, the, the work chat, which was like a piece of everyone

182
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:38,885
Speaker 4:  that wasn't very used. It, it, it wasn't also particularly powerful. So understandably

183
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:42,445
Speaker 4:  people used something else for it and it allowed us to simplify

184
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:45,845
Speaker 4:  some part of the product. But yeah, it's not like you can come and just say,

185
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:48,805
Speaker 4:  okay, I'll remove everything except for that thing, because that thing is

186
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:51,565
Speaker 4:  the only thing people care about. No, no. That's not possible.

187
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:54,565
Speaker 3:  Right. I mean, and even If, you take a button that's over here and you move

188
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:57,365
Speaker 3:  it to over there. Yeah. Yeah. 5% of people are going to absolutely lose their

189
00:11:57,365 --> 00:12:01,125
Speaker 3:  minds about it. Absolutely. Yeah. So the individual note taking thing I think

190
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,205
Speaker 3:  is really interesting because I've talked to a lot of folks over the years

191
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:08,565
Speaker 3:  who build a thing that is for something like individual

192
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:12,365
Speaker 3:  note taking or I had this like deep obsession with to-do lists or to-do

193
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:16,085
Speaker 3:  lists or calendar apps or whatever. All of these kind of productivity tools

194
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:20,365
Speaker 3:  start by being for people. Yeah. And then you realize where actually

195
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:23,525
Speaker 3:  the money is, is by selling to teams. And so they build the

196
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,925
Speaker 3:  collaboration environments and you build out all the business tools and all

197
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:30,605
Speaker 3:  of a sudden you've changed the app entirely into something that is basically

198
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:34,485
Speaker 3:  like a thing meant for lots of people to use at once, which

199
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:37,725
Speaker 3:  becomes sort of the lowest common denominator kind of app and causes,

200
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:41,205
Speaker 3:  it just changes, right? Yeah. Like, I think Notion is my favorite example,

201
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:45,165
Speaker 3:  right? Like Notion is a very good app that is completely different now

202
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,605
Speaker 3:  that they mostly sell the companies than it was when they were mostly focused

203
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:50,325
Speaker 3:  on individual users. Yeah. Not necessarily right or wrong, they make a lot

204
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:54,205
Speaker 3:  more money because they sell to companies. But this idea of individual note

205
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:58,165
Speaker 3:  taking, both as a product and as a business, I

206
00:12:58,165 --> 00:13:01,525
Speaker 3:  think there, there are a lot of people out there who are not convinced that's

207
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:05,445
Speaker 3:  a thing with a big enough market to be Yeah. Worth it. Are you, are

208
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:06,205
Speaker 3:  you sure that it is?

209
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:10,685
Speaker 4:  Well, the thing is, like If, you take into account

210
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:14,565
Speaker 4:  what, what customers tell you. You'll, you'll kind of find the answer. So

211
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:18,565
Speaker 4:  if If you tell people, yeah, I'm going to turn Evernote into

212
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:21,325
Speaker 4:  a Teams product and, and which

213
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:24,165
Speaker 3:  Is kind of what Evernote tried to do, right? Like at there was a period of

214
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:26,485
Speaker 3:  time, like the work chat thing you're talking about, like there was a minute

215
00:13:26,485 --> 00:13:28,805
Speaker 3:  where Evernote was like, we are going to be a business tool. Yes.

216
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:32,725
Speaker 4:  Yes. I I think they were seeing where the market was going and

217
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:36,325
Speaker 4:  they wanted to, to follow that, but still they had this huge

218
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,125
Speaker 4:  use case o of individual note taking that they couldn't ignore. And so they

219
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,365
Speaker 4:  tried to do kind of both things. So I, I don't have like a

220
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:47,365
Speaker 4:  perfect plan for how to achieve that. My, my, my

221
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:51,765
Speaker 4:  North Star is you talk to customers, they tell you I

222
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:55,165
Speaker 4:  want this. You talk to enough customers and you notice

223
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,725
Speaker 4:  if something that you're planning on building goes against that direction.

224
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:01,525
Speaker 4:  So I mentioned collaboration earlier because it's something that we would

225
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:05,365
Speaker 4:  like to work on, but it doesn't mean like turning Evernote into a

226
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,725
Speaker 4:  collaboration only tool, for instance, or like, or like a collaboration first

227
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:12,445
Speaker 4:  tool. You, you still need to, to keep into account what current

228
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:16,845
Speaker 4:  people using Evernote think Evernote should do and, and try to make it good

229
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:19,365
Speaker 4:  for that use case first. And then If, you want, you cannot some, some of

230
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:22,245
Speaker 4:  that. And, and the cool thing is that people are asking for that. It's not

231
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:25,885
Speaker 4:  something that I, I came up with or we came up with at some point and, and

232
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:28,525
Speaker 4:  said, yeah, it would be cool if everyone was more collaborative and, and

233
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:31,685
Speaker 4:  we will do it against what people want. It's more like

234
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:35,365
Speaker 4:  we sit down, we have countless conversations every week with customers and,

235
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:38,885
Speaker 4:  and they tell us. Yeah. But like, sharing notes, sharing notes, notebooks

236
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:42,765
Speaker 4:  is a pain. I I wish it worked well and Okay, that's

237
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:43,645
Speaker 4:  cool. We'll do it. Yeah.

238
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:46,605
Speaker 3:  Yeah. What else were people asking you for? Because I feel like there's a

239
00:14:46,605 --> 00:14:50,285
Speaker 3:  certain set of kind of big picture things that people build for stuff like

240
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:52,565
Speaker 3:  this. Like collaboration is one of them. Yeah. And, and I, I can't imagine

241
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:54,605
Speaker 3:  you're sitting with a lot of people who are like, I'd like for there to be

242
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:57,125
Speaker 3:  a real time collaborative editor. Yeah. But it makes sense that people were

243
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,725
Speaker 3:  like, I, it's annoying that I can't share notes with my partner. Like simple

244
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:04,725
Speaker 3:  use case. That totally works. What else on those levels were

245
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:05,845
Speaker 3:  people telling you about at the beginning? Yeah,

246
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:09,725
Speaker 4:  So we have this track, which is called Quality of Life,

247
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:14,125
Speaker 4:  that goes a bit against what usually product management should be

248
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,685
Speaker 4:  about, which is classically product management should be about like identifying

249
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:20,285
Speaker 4:  a metric and trying to optimize for, for that metric and building something

250
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:22,525
Speaker 4:  to, to make it, to make that metric work better.

251
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:27,125
Speaker 3:  Like the app is faster or Yeah. Or people open it next time

252
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:27,885
Speaker 3:  or whatever. Okay.

253
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,605
Speaker 4:  Exactly. Yes. Instead this, this track, this quality of life

254
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:35,445
Speaker 4:  track goes in the direction where we talk to as many customers as we can

255
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,965
Speaker 4:  either, like in conversations that we have on, on like Google Meet every

256
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:42,685
Speaker 4:  week or through surveys and we just try to quantify,

257
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,845
Speaker 4:  first identify what, what they want and then to quantify how many of

258
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,765
Speaker 4:  them want what. And, and so we just like rank a list of, of things

259
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:53,485
Speaker 4:  that people want and we try to build them. Of course, if something takes

260
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,085
Speaker 4:  like six months, maybe we, we, we will ignore it for, for the time being.

261
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:59,965
Speaker 4:  But we, we try to to make it as, as ranked as possible.

262
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:03,645
Speaker 4:  Okay. And so, so good examples of this are collapsible sections

263
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:07,485
Speaker 4:  Hmm. People were saying. Yeah. How can it be that that after 20 years, everyone

264
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:09,325
Speaker 4:  still doesn't have collapsible sections. Okay.

265
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:11,365
Speaker 3:  Wait, I, I wanna get to the rest of this, but can we actually pause on this

266
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:14,885
Speaker 3:  for sure for a second because I am one of those people. Okay. And like, the

267
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:18,005
Speaker 3:  way I work generally is I, I like, I think in outlines So, I do a lot of

268
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:21,045
Speaker 3:  bullets and I have very long lists. Yep. And being able to collapse individual

269
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:24,925
Speaker 3:  parts of those lists is just most of what I need from a notes.

270
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:28,405
Speaker 3:  And I have heard sort of vaguely over the years, a lot of people say that

271
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,445
Speaker 3:  is a strangely difficult thing to build. Can you explain to me why that's

272
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:32,765
Speaker 3:  so hard? Why can't I have it?

273
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:34,245
Speaker 4:  Well, So

274
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:39,445
Speaker 4:  I, I, I don't know specifically how we implemented it, but

275
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:43,805
Speaker 4:  the thing is that the note, you can imagine the note as a kind of a webpage.

276
00:16:44,145 --> 00:16:48,005
Speaker 4:  And so everything that kind of edits some part

277
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:51,645
Speaker 4:  of that webpage is kind of tricky to, to do, especially when you leave, leave

278
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:55,405
Speaker 4:  the rest untouched and So I. I think that might be what they were

279
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:58,725
Speaker 4:  referring to, but I, I don't think it was particularly difficult to build.

280
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:03,445
Speaker 4:  I think it was reasonably normal. Okay. In terms

281
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:03,965
Speaker 4:  of difficulty.

282
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:08,005
Speaker 3:  Okay. So fascinating that that's the first one on that you think of, right?

283
00:17:08,005 --> 00:17:10,405
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It might not have been the top of the list, but like, it, it's a good

284
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,965
Speaker 3:  example of Yeah, I think there are a lot of like big

285
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:16,325
Speaker 3:  kind of whizzbang features that people are talking about. And we're gonna

286
00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:20,325
Speaker 3:  talk about AI in a minute. Yep. Like the whizzbang ist feature of All

287
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:24,285
Speaker 3:  right. Now, but I I, my suspicion when I asked you

288
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:27,285
Speaker 3:  that question was that most of what people wanted from you was going to be

289
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:30,845
Speaker 3:  things about the size of collapsible sections. What else is on that list?

290
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:34,965
Speaker 4:  Well, slash comments was also a big one. Mm. So like, like you can do on

291
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:38,525
Speaker 4:  Slack, you hit slash and then you type a comment. So on Slack you do, it's

292
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:38,725
Speaker 4:  like, it's

293
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:41,165
Speaker 3:  Fascinating that that's become like a universal thing now. People understand

294
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:43,085
Speaker 3:  slash commands now it's so Yeah. It's really great. Yeah. Yeah.

295
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,285
Speaker 4:  It's like, I don't know, it's like right click, you know? Yeah. It's something

296
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:50,125
Speaker 4:  that, that you do no matter the the operating system

297
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,645
Speaker 4:  you're in. No. And so that's also something that people were asking it, it's

298
00:17:53,645 --> 00:17:56,845
Speaker 4:  a bit more of a niche feature collapsible section. I I just bring it up because

299
00:17:56,955 --> 00:18:00,445
Speaker 4:  it's the obvious example of quality of life feature that everybody wanted,

300
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:04,205
Speaker 4:  but slash comments was also a big one. Let me think.

301
00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:08,725
Speaker 4:  Well, image alignment is also like a classic, you know, like you, you could

302
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:11,725
Speaker 4:  not align an image in the center or, or Right, right. You could only have

303
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:14,485
Speaker 4:  it on on the left and you cannot edit it. So Yeah. We, we built it.

304
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:18,525
Speaker 3:  Another one that seems to mystify every document editor everywhere.

305
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like why can't I put my photo where I would like it to be? Yeah. Yeah.

306
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:23,485
Speaker 3:  Shockingly difficult. Text editing

307
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:26,405
Speaker 4:  Probably, you know, there, I think there are memes about Microsoft Word.

308
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like messing the whole layout of the document. Yep. Yeah.

309
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:32,285
Speaker 3:  Alright, we gotta take a break. But when we come back, I wanna talk about

310
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:35,645
Speaker 3:  what it means to build a productivity tool in 2024.

311
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,725
Speaker 3:  Instead of doing it in 2014 or 2004 when Evernote was starting

312
00:18:39,725 --> 00:18:41,405
Speaker 3:  out. We'll get to all that. We'll be right back.

313
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:49,995
Speaker 4:  people were asking for and especially

314
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:54,755
Speaker 4:  in between advanced users. There was this need of like having

315
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:58,635
Speaker 4:  a better task manager being Evernote individual. Most people who

316
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:02,115
Speaker 4:  use Evernote either use it for their, their own like

317
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:06,035
Speaker 4:  organization and not, not for a team organization or they

318
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:10,035
Speaker 4:  use it for like very small projects or, or like projects with, with

319
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:13,755
Speaker 4:  few people involved. And so we were asking people what would you like us

320
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:17,715
Speaker 4:  to, to do? And, and tasks was a big part of what they were

321
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:20,875
Speaker 4:  asking for. Why do you think that is? To improve? I I think it's because

322
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:25,395
Speaker 4:  they were already there. So So, I, I think that previous teams in the past

323
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:29,515
Speaker 4:  built ANOT tasks and given that ANOT

324
00:20:29,515 --> 00:20:32,355
Speaker 4:  is not a task management tool, they, they didn't give it like a lot of attention.

325
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:36,675
Speaker 4:  And So I think that the reason why people were asking for better tasks

326
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:40,755
Speaker 4:  was because they were already there. I I think that maybe if tasks weren't

327
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:43,395
Speaker 4:  there in the first place, maybe people wouldn't have, wouldn't have asked

328
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:44,475
Speaker 4:  for it, but I'm not sure.

329
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:48,645
Speaker 3:  Okay. You, you've just raised the philosophical question about productivity

330
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:52,525
Speaker 3:  tools. That is my favorite thing to talk about. So I think the, the two schools

331
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:55,605
Speaker 3:  of thought as people are sitting there telling you we want tasks inside of

332
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:59,565
Speaker 3:  Evernote. One is to say people are inside of our app, there's lots

333
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:02,725
Speaker 3:  of information inside of our app, we should give people more stuff to do.

334
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:06,645
Speaker 3:  Right? Like that makes sense. Build in to, to-do list build in

335
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:10,285
Speaker 3:  calendar. You'll eventually end up making like an email app inside of there.

336
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:13,565
Speaker 3:  You'll you'll do, you'll do work chat again, right? Like you can go down

337
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:17,445
Speaker 3:  this road of yeah, this is an app full of your stuff, we should do more with

338
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:20,445
Speaker 3:  it. And you eventually just recreate Microsoft Office, right? Like, that

339
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,965
Speaker 3:  is one path. The other path is to say we are

340
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:28,725
Speaker 3:  going to avoid the kind of feature creep crustiness that has

341
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:31,925
Speaker 3:  plagued Evernote and other apps in the past. We're going to slim it down

342
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:36,125
Speaker 3:  that actually what this app needs is to be more opinionated and simple. And

343
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,805
Speaker 3:  If, you want a task manager, awesome. There's a bunch of sick ones over here,

344
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,805
Speaker 3:  one swipe or click away. And

345
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,445
Speaker 3:  I, I actually have a, I have a an opinion on which of those I think is the

346
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:52,245
Speaker 3:  better answer. But I'm curious how you reason out between

347
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:55,725
Speaker 3:  saying to people, like, I think one totally valid answer would be to say

348
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:58,805
Speaker 3:  Evernote is not a task management app. Yeah. That's not what we're here for.

349
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:01,605
Speaker 3:  If. you wanna write a checklist? We've got you. We're good at that. Yeah.

350
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:05,125
Speaker 3:  But If you are like a person who wants to do like capital T tasks.

351
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,725
Speaker 3:  That's just not what ever notice is for. I feel like that would've been a

352
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:10,885
Speaker 3:  perfectly valid answer even if it made some people mad. Why did you decide

353
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:11,445
Speaker 3:  to go the other way?

354
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:15,165
Speaker 4:  Man, that's such a hard question. I'm not sure I can answer that. So

355
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:20,005
Speaker 4:  I can give you a few thoughts. The first one is, it's, it's the age old

356
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:23,205
Speaker 4:  question of bundling and unbundling, you know, totally. Like, it's, it's

357
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:26,885
Speaker 4:  software history is full of people like bundling and unbundling products

358
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:30,725
Speaker 4:  and, and they, and they always like try to integrate more stuff and

359
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:34,605
Speaker 4:  then some somebody new arises from, from like a little startup because they

360
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:38,565
Speaker 4:  just focused on that thing and they do well. So So I think it's, it's

361
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:42,605
Speaker 4:  an age old question. And I think that on Evernote, on one

362
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:45,965
Speaker 4:  hand you want to do what people want to, to have, so you want to build what,

363
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:49,565
Speaker 4:  what people need. And if it's tasks why not? Like, you know,

364
00:22:49,865 --> 00:22:53,525
Speaker 4:  why, why collapsible sections Yes. And, and tasks not. So that's, that's

365
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:57,045
Speaker 4:  one way to look at it. The other way to look at it

366
00:22:57,305 --> 00:23:00,925
Speaker 4:  is, as you said, being opinionated. And I think that there is a,

367
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:05,445
Speaker 4:  I don't know if I'm being too like democratic or, or, or if I'm,

368
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:06,725
Speaker 4:  I don't want to choose, but

369
00:23:06,735 --> 00:23:08,765
Speaker 3:  We're about to talk about that. I, I, that's my next question.

370
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:13,085
Speaker 4:  I think that the best way to solve it is through customization. Okay. So

371
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:16,925
Speaker 4:  that you don't want to use tasks, you just like hide

372
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:20,805
Speaker 4:  that that part or you don't want to use calendar. You, you can just

373
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:24,765
Speaker 4:  not use it and, and hopefully have some tools to like make sure

374
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:28,685
Speaker 4:  that the UI doesn't get too messy for you. And I think that that

375
00:23:28,685 --> 00:23:31,245
Speaker 4:  might be the, the answer, but I'm not sure yet. Yeah. We're, we're looking

376
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:31,925
Speaker 4:  into it. So, I,

377
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:35,925
Speaker 3:  I buy that theory pretty much entirely. Like, I think

378
00:23:35,925 --> 00:23:39,605
Speaker 3:  that's right and I actually think with a lot of things, giving people

379
00:23:40,255 --> 00:23:43,805
Speaker 3:  tools to set something up for themselves is really cool and really powerful.

380
00:23:43,805 --> 00:23:47,165
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I also think it leads to trouble because

381
00:23:47,555 --> 00:23:51,445
Speaker 3:  it's, it's just really hard to do that in a way that is good and helpful

382
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:55,565
Speaker 3:  and also most people don't touch the defaults and so whatever

383
00:23:55,995 --> 00:23:59,605
Speaker 3:  weirdness is on by default, they're gonna get regardless. But I also think

384
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:03,845
Speaker 3:  like realistically, you, your team is only so big. You only have so

385
00:24:03,845 --> 00:24:07,725
Speaker 3:  many things to do. Everything you add is going to make the

386
00:24:07,725 --> 00:24:11,245
Speaker 3:  app bigger. Yeah. It's gonna make it more complicated. It's gonna make it

387
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:14,965
Speaker 3:  slower. And So I think the question of especially

388
00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:17,765
Speaker 3:  I'm just So I, like this thing where you're coming from this long history

389
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:20,725
Speaker 3:  of Evernote where it kind of lost its way by trying to do too much

390
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:25,445
Speaker 3:  back to, you don't want to try to do too much, but

391
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:28,965
Speaker 3:  like one of my favorite things to do is go into the discords of productivity

392
00:24:28,965 --> 00:24:32,765
Speaker 3:  apps. Yeah. Because I'm a loser doesn't have any friends and

393
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:36,045
Speaker 3:  just watch what people ask for. Yeah. And everybody asks for everything all

394
00:24:36,045 --> 00:24:39,285
Speaker 3:  the time. Yes. Right. And everybody has the one teeny tiny thing that works

395
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:42,605
Speaker 3:  for their use that specifically. Correct. And If, you give it to them, they'll

396
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:46,005
Speaker 3:  love your app forever and ever. But for every person on planet Earth, that

397
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:49,725
Speaker 3:  thing is different. Yes. And I, I actually admire the impulse to give all

398
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:52,205
Speaker 3:  those people what they want, but you can't, you'll ruin your app. Right.

399
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:55,725
Speaker 3:  And I think we, we've seen what happens when you try. Yeah. So

400
00:24:55,915 --> 00:24:59,845
Speaker 3:  like, I I, the strategy of sort of being democratic and giving people

401
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:02,805
Speaker 3:  what they want makes a lot of sense to me. But I do wonder, like, do you

402
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:05,765
Speaker 3:  have to have boundaries in your head of Absolutely. Like if enough people

403
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:08,085
Speaker 3:  asked you to make an email client inside of Evernote, would you make an email

404
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:08,925
Speaker 3:  client inside of Evernote?

405
00:25:09,145 --> 00:25:13,045
Speaker 4:  It depends on how many they are and it depends on how good the, the UX that

406
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:13,965
Speaker 4:  we can prototype is. Okay.

407
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:15,045
Speaker 3:  So tell me what the boundaries are then.

408
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:18,005
Speaker 4:  I think that, that the boundaries are always about

409
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:22,565
Speaker 4:  what is Evernote, you know, and in order to answer that you can just look

410
00:25:22,565 --> 00:25:26,165
Speaker 4:  at how many people use what inside Evernote. So of course Evernote being

411
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:30,045
Speaker 4:  what it is, the note editor is the most used part together with

412
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:33,605
Speaker 4:  know, like lists somewhere in the app. So when we work on

413
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:37,645
Speaker 4:  quality of life improvements, which is one of our biggest tracks and, and

414
00:25:37,645 --> 00:25:41,245
Speaker 4:  non synchronization projects, which is also one of our biggest tracks.

415
00:25:42,055 --> 00:25:45,845
Speaker 4:  Those are about note taking. And like to the

416
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:49,685
Speaker 4:  core I would say, I dunno, 80, 90% of the team is focused

417
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:53,085
Speaker 4:  on the core note taking experience. And so If, you look at what we released

418
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:57,045
Speaker 4:  this year. So the, this year we had this like idealistic goal of

419
00:25:57,045 --> 00:26:01,005
Speaker 4:  releasing 100 quality of life improvements. We

420
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:04,205
Speaker 4:  shipped I think 60 or 65. I don't know. That's pretty good

421
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:07,125
Speaker 3:  For now. We should, and it's late August. We're that's pretty solid.

422
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:11,005
Speaker 4:  I think we are kind of on track. Yeah. I think Evernote is going to be fine

423
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:15,245
Speaker 4:  as long as we are very intentional with the fact that

424
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:19,445
Speaker 4:  everyone's focuses on note taking. Okay. I I I think as long as we

425
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:22,965
Speaker 4:  recognize that and we work with that in mind, I think everyone is going to

426
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:26,805
Speaker 4:  be fine. Then if some people want to have a calendar client inside it, it's

427
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:29,805
Speaker 4:  fine. But, but I, I, I don't think, I don't see

428
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:34,125
Speaker 4:  a way for the team to be mostly focused on calendar going forward. Okay.

429
00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:36,605
Speaker 4:  Even though like, yeah, I would like to improve it.

430
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:40,365
Speaker 3:  When you say note taking, I'm curious what, what's your sense of what that

431
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:44,325
Speaker 3:  looks like for people in 2024? Because I, I look back to like

432
00:26:44,765 --> 00:26:48,365
Speaker 3:  Evernote at the very beginning of the app store. Right. And its thing was

433
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:52,085
Speaker 3:  like, it was very easy to put stuff into Evernote. Yeah. And for years,

434
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:55,885
Speaker 3:  the strangest thing about the productivity space to me was that nobody built

435
00:26:55,925 --> 00:26:58,805
Speaker 3:  a web clipper as good as Evernotes. Yeah. That was just like, I have a thing

436
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:02,485
Speaker 3:  and I need to get it into my notes app. Evernote has always been better at

437
00:27:02,485 --> 00:27:06,365
Speaker 3:  that than everybody. Yeah. Still is. Which is bizarre. Yeah. All these

438
00:27:06,365 --> 00:27:10,005
Speaker 3:  years later. But my sense is as

439
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:13,965
Speaker 3:  like we're in this space now where there's this renewed interest in

440
00:27:14,385 --> 00:27:17,685
Speaker 3:  Second Brain stuff and everybody talks about like zeal castens on the internet

441
00:27:17,685 --> 00:27:21,525
Speaker 3:  and personal knowledge management and all this stuff. And

442
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:25,125
Speaker 3:  then with AI there is this sort of renewed sense of like, here's how we organize

443
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:28,205
Speaker 3:  our stuff and how we manage our digital lives. When you think about like

444
00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:31,605
Speaker 3:  what note taking means, how, how sort of

445
00:27:31,855 --> 00:27:34,845
Speaker 3:  broad or narrow is your definition of that at this point? It's

446
00:27:34,845 --> 00:27:36,445
Speaker 4:  Super broad. Okay. Like, I, I,

447
00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:42,005
Speaker 4:  I think we talked to hundreds of customers in the

448
00:27:42,005 --> 00:27:45,285
Speaker 4:  last year and I don't recall two people

449
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:49,365
Speaker 4:  telling me that they follow exactly the same, the same like flow

450
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:52,845
Speaker 4:  or system. Sure. Yeah. Maybe some people like mention, I dunno, some frameworks

451
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:56,725
Speaker 4:  like para getting things done, et cetera. But, but then they always

452
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,765
Speaker 4:  customize it because they have one slightly different thing that they need

453
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:03,525
Speaker 4:  to do. And then there's people who handle everything like house related

454
00:28:03,545 --> 00:28:07,245
Speaker 4:  on Evernote, but also their work people who are consultants, they have a

455
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:11,205
Speaker 4:  bunch of projects, et cetera. And then people who are more or less interested

456
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:15,245
Speaker 4:  in, in like saving everything they do. And

457
00:28:15,405 --> 00:28:18,885
Speaker 4:  so, yeah, it's super broad. It, it's like there is

458
00:28:19,305 --> 00:28:23,045
Speaker 4:  nobody who does it in the same exact way as somebody else

459
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:26,925
Speaker 4:  does. And so for that reason, I think, well, customization again is important,

460
00:28:26,945 --> 00:28:30,125
Speaker 4:  but, but also building the tools for them to do it, it's also important.

461
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:30,805
Speaker 4:  So

462
00:28:30,805 --> 00:28:32,805
Speaker 3:  What are the, what are the buckets you think about when you think about like

463
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:37,085
Speaker 3:  how to do note taking really well, what does that Yeah. Require even

464
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:38,125
Speaker 3:  at like a higher level?

465
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,445
Speaker 4:  I think it depends on what you do. So we kind of identified a few

466
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:46,885
Speaker 4:  families of, of like categories of ways you could do note taking.

467
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:50,285
Speaker 4:  So for instance, there's a category that we call the Archivers. And there

468
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:54,045
Speaker 4:  are people who basically save everything in, in inside

469
00:28:54,045 --> 00:28:57,525
Speaker 4:  Evernote. And they like, as you mentioned with web, the web clipper, there

470
00:28:57,525 --> 00:29:01,045
Speaker 4:  are people who automatically forward every email they receive

471
00:29:01,665 --> 00:29:05,485
Speaker 4:  to Evernote. Whoa. Every, even email, even like newsletters and

472
00:29:05,655 --> 00:29:07,445
Speaker 4:  stuff, every email they have like a filter in

473
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,925
Speaker 3:  Email. L has a sale. It goes straight to Evernote. Absolute.

474
00:29:09,925 --> 00:29:13,605
Speaker 4:  Okay. And so you, you see why there are some people who have like a hundred,

475
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:13,965
Speaker 4:  that is

476
00:29:13,965 --> 00:29:14,885
Speaker 3:  My nightmare. A hundred

477
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:18,885
Speaker 4:  Thousand notes and everyth. Yeah. So for them, you just need to build

478
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:22,365
Speaker 4:  just like as if it was easy. But you, you need to build a very good like

479
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:26,125
Speaker 4:  organization tool. Then there are some people who are writers and they

480
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:30,205
Speaker 4:  don't even write that many notes, but they write long notes and complex

481
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:33,805
Speaker 4:  notes and they want to have, like, they care a lot about the craft of, of

482
00:29:33,825 --> 00:29:37,725
Speaker 4:  how the note is structured and how it's written, what they can add

483
00:29:37,745 --> 00:29:41,325
Speaker 4:  to the note and different, like for instance, when we created the quote block,

484
00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:45,125
Speaker 4:  which is nothing like incredibly, particularly, particularly

485
00:29:45,355 --> 00:29:49,085
Speaker 4:  it's in every piece of software that I know of. But it's basically a, a different

486
00:29:49,085 --> 00:29:52,125
Speaker 4:  way to, to look at a bunch of text, a block of text. And you can just see

487
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:55,525
Speaker 4:  the as if it was a quote and these people went crazy for it, even though

488
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:58,645
Speaker 4:  it's so simple, you know, because they, they go crazy for how you can build

489
00:29:58,725 --> 00:30:02,525
Speaker 4:  a note. And then there are people who are particularly interested in,

490
00:30:02,585 --> 00:30:06,005
Speaker 4:  in like personal knowledge management as, as you said. And so they want to

491
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:09,845
Speaker 4:  see Evernote as their one tool and they would like to have

492
00:30:09,845 --> 00:30:13,525
Speaker 4:  their own life running on Evernote. So if Evernote did like, I dunno, something

493
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:17,485
Speaker 4:  weird like banking, they would love it. They could

494
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:21,045
Speaker 4:  just use for that. Of course. That, that's crazy. But, so yeah, basically

495
00:30:21,045 --> 00:30:24,685
Speaker 4:  we try to look at the interception of all these categories

496
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,765
Speaker 4:  and we try to build the things that are as effective as possible for as

497
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:32,085
Speaker 4:  many people in these categories as possible. And then if there's one of these

498
00:30:32,085 --> 00:30:36,005
Speaker 4:  groups that needs something specific to them, we'll still build it if it's,

499
00:30:36,005 --> 00:30:37,765
Speaker 4:  if it's important enough to their use case.

500
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:41,885
Speaker 3:  Got it. Okay. And how much do you think about the

501
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:45,605
Speaker 3:  work of like doing some of that stuff for people

502
00:30:45,985 --> 00:30:49,965
Speaker 3:  versus sort of giving them a, a canvas to do it for themselves? And I think

503
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:52,605
Speaker 3:  organization is one really interesting one, right? Where one of the things

504
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:55,005
Speaker 3:  that's happening in a lot of these tools is they're like, don't worry about

505
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:58,645
Speaker 3:  organizing. We'll we'll use AI to suggest tags or

506
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:02,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah, we'll, we'll just magically do the search and all this stuff for you.

507
00:31:02,305 --> 00:31:06,045
Speaker 3:  And I think I, I sense this sort of schism in this space

508
00:31:06,045 --> 00:31:08,805
Speaker 3:  between people who are like, what I want is like a really fast, really nice,

509
00:31:08,805 --> 00:31:12,365
Speaker 3:  really pleasant tool that doesn't tell me how to

510
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:16,325
Speaker 3:  use it, that I can just use however I want. And then there's another

511
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:19,805
Speaker 3:  set of people who are like, what I wanna do is spend a lot less time thinking

512
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:23,365
Speaker 3:  about my notes. I just wanna dump every email I get into

513
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:26,525
Speaker 3:  Evernote and have it make sense of all of those things for me. Yeah. And

514
00:31:26,565 --> 00:31:30,485
Speaker 3:  I kind of feel like you can't be both of those things at the same time. Yeah.

515
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,565
Speaker 4:  I don't think there is a way to build something that works

516
00:31:35,665 --> 00:31:39,365
Speaker 4:  in the perfect way for both So I think that the perfect re

517
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:43,445
Speaker 4:  the perfect approach is to build both kind of, build a

518
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:46,525
Speaker 4:  product that supports both Okay. Use cases. So

519
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:50,885
Speaker 4:  increasingly there are people who just want to dump stuff into

520
00:31:51,005 --> 00:31:54,965
Speaker 4:  Evernote and then like ask ai search Right.

521
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:57,885
Speaker 4:  To, to retrieve the information they want. So for instance, one, one of my

522
00:31:58,005 --> 00:32:01,245
Speaker 4:  favorite examples is one person I think uploaded the

523
00:32:02,425 --> 00:32:06,365
Speaker 4:  manual for their kitchen clock I think Sure.

524
00:32:06,985 --> 00:32:10,525
Speaker 4:  On, on Evernote. And then they wanted to know how to, I dunno, change from

525
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:14,005
Speaker 4:  from Celsius to Fahrenheit in the, in the clock.

526
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:18,885
Speaker 4:  And, and they just asked AI search and, and he just scanned the PDF

527
00:32:18,985 --> 00:32:21,645
Speaker 4:  and, and just told him like, you should, you should do this, this, and that.

528
00:32:22,165 --> 00:32:25,845
Speaker 4:  Which was interesting. Of course this is not useful to somebody who

529
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:29,765
Speaker 4:  uses Evernote not even to collect stuff, but to

530
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:33,765
Speaker 4:  organize it in a, in a way that, that like mimics their

531
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:37,885
Speaker 4:  mental map of how their content is organized. And so for them

532
00:32:37,995 --> 00:32:41,525
Speaker 4:  it's much more important to build stuff like, I dunno, stocks

533
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:45,725
Speaker 4:  for, for notebooks for instance. Or, or like multiple levels of, of hierarchy

534
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:49,205
Speaker 4:  and stuff like that. So, so you, you see how you need to build different

535
00:32:49,205 --> 00:32:50,365
Speaker 4:  things for, for different use cases.

536
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:54,605
Speaker 3:  That first use case, the like, I wanna

537
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:58,325
Speaker 3:  upload stuff to Evernote and have Evernote just kind of know it Yeah.

538
00:32:59,305 --> 00:33:03,205
Speaker 3:  Is so new and so interesting to me. Yeah. And I feel

539
00:33:03,205 --> 00:33:06,645
Speaker 3:  like in a, in a certain way is like the obvious next step of this, right?

540
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:10,445
Speaker 3:  Where instead of searching for a note, I should just be able to

541
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:13,245
Speaker 3:  search for information that I need and it doesn't really matter where it

542
00:33:13,245 --> 00:33:17,085
Speaker 3:  is. Yeah. Like as a, as a person who likes to organize stuff, that kinda

543
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:20,605
Speaker 3:  makes me itchy, but I also understand why that's really valuable. Is that,

544
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:24,365
Speaker 3:  are we getting to that point? Like, is is that a, a thing you're investing

545
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:28,205
Speaker 3:  in a lot? 'cause that also causes some really interesting privacy and

546
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:31,525
Speaker 3:  data security questions Yeah. And changes like the, the literal cost of running

547
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:35,205
Speaker 3:  the service. Are you, is there gonna be more and more of that

548
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:39,125
Speaker 3:  kind of put everything in and let the app make sense of all your

549
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:41,645
Speaker 3:  information for you coming in overnight? Yeah.

550
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:45,045
Speaker 4:  It's, it's something that's trending. So it's clearly something that people

551
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:48,685
Speaker 4:  are starting to explore more. Both because they are

552
00:33:48,705 --> 00:33:52,565
Speaker 4:  seeing how it could work because maybe they are getting familiar with chat

553
00:33:52,605 --> 00:33:55,805
Speaker 4:  g PT or, or other AI products. But also because I think that

554
00:33:56,315 --> 00:33:59,085
Speaker 4:  deep down this, this is something that people always wanted. You know, you,

555
00:33:59,085 --> 00:34:01,605
Speaker 4:  you just want to talk to a computer and the computer just tells you what,

556
00:34:01,605 --> 00:34:05,045
Speaker 4:  what you want to know instead of like going through this like

557
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:09,285
Speaker 4:  level of emulation, which is like, I have to click on a mouse and then open

558
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:12,325
Speaker 4:  a page and then I read the information out of that. I I just want to know

559
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:13,285
Speaker 4:  that information, you know? Right.

560
00:34:13,305 --> 00:34:16,845
Speaker 3:  My favorite example is always I have, I have a note with

561
00:34:17,145 --> 00:34:21,045
Speaker 3:  all of my like account and loyalty numbers for different airlines and car

562
00:34:21,045 --> 00:34:24,405
Speaker 3:  rental places and stuff like that. Yeah. And every time I do it, if I just

563
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:27,645
Speaker 3:  search Delta, it brings up too many notes. 'cause it has everything with

564
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:30,645
Speaker 3:  the word delta in it. And So I have to remember like, okay, the thing is

565
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:34,725
Speaker 3:  actually called accounts space slash space loyalty numbers. And

566
00:34:34,725 --> 00:34:37,885
Speaker 3:  then it's like, no, it's loyalty, it's something else. And so it's like finding

567
00:34:37,885 --> 00:34:40,965
Speaker 3:  this is a pain and what I want is just to say what's my, what's my Delta

568
00:34:41,685 --> 00:34:45,485
Speaker 3:  frequent flyer number? Yeah. And it just pops it up. Yeah. A feels

569
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:48,765
Speaker 3:  like a terrific use case for a notes app and B feels like in a funny way,

570
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,725
Speaker 3:  actually a thing AI is able to do. I think we're at a place where a lot of

571
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:55,885
Speaker 3:  people are like, I'm gonna throw all these interesting links and Evernote

572
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:59,605
Speaker 3:  or something else is going to Yeah. Make new insights out of them. It's like,

573
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:03,445
Speaker 3:  yeah, no it's not, but it might find information for you Yeah. That

574
00:35:03,445 --> 00:35:07,045
Speaker 3:  would otherwise take you several steps to find. Does that, does that feel

575
00:35:07,245 --> 00:35:09,765
Speaker 3:  like the right frame for how you're thinking about some of this stuff? It

576
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:13,605
Speaker 4:  Is exactly why we built AI search a few months ago. Like I think last

577
00:35:13,605 --> 00:35:17,525
Speaker 4:  year. I don't think we nailed it yet. I think we'll need to iterate again

578
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:21,205
Speaker 4:  on that. Okay. But it's exactly the, the vision behind it. So

579
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,125
Speaker 4:  you have some information there. You don't need to care about where it is.

580
00:35:24,385 --> 00:35:28,365
Speaker 4:  You just look for your Delta account number and just

581
00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:32,285
Speaker 4:  tells you, yeah, it's X, y, Z and it should already be able to do it.

582
00:35:32,285 --> 00:35:36,005
Speaker 4:  It's just a bit clunky. It's, it's not easily, it's not easy to find

583
00:35:36,065 --> 00:35:38,765
Speaker 4:  inside Evernote because we want to make sure that, that we don't disrupt,

584
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:41,805
Speaker 4:  like search search is a very important feature ever. So we, we didn't want

585
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:44,805
Speaker 4:  to replace it, but it's already possible. You can already do it, I think.

586
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:45,205
Speaker 4:  Okay.

587
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:49,245
Speaker 3:  Well and I think that goes back to the bundling and unbundling Yeah. For

588
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:53,005
Speaker 3:  me, in a really interesting way because the, the last phase of software has

589
00:35:53,005 --> 00:35:56,685
Speaker 3:  definitely been unbundling. We're back, we're in this like best in breed,

590
00:35:57,515 --> 00:36:00,965
Speaker 3:  kind of take one slice of something, do it super well. Yeah. And it's all

591
00:36:00,965 --> 00:36:04,565
Speaker 3:  just apps on your home screen. So, I, it's not like the switching cost is

592
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:08,325
Speaker 3:  super high from thing to thing. Yeah. But when I'm working with an AI

593
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:12,085
Speaker 3:  system, having there be one place that

594
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:15,605
Speaker 3:  knows everything, again, leaving all of the like

595
00:36:15,915 --> 00:36:19,685
Speaker 3:  privacy and security Yeah. And terrifying dystopian

596
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:23,645
Speaker 3:  things out, that's really valuable. Yeah. And so for me to know

597
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:28,445
Speaker 3:  every, every confirmation number, every loyalty number, all of

598
00:36:28,445 --> 00:36:32,365
Speaker 3:  my email, everything is all knowing all of that is in one place Yeah. Becomes

599
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:36,165
Speaker 3:  really valuable. And So I think, it seems to me that If you think

600
00:36:36,505 --> 00:36:40,245
Speaker 3:  AI is gonna become a bigger and bigger part of this that would sort of expand

601
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:43,245
Speaker 3:  the boundaries of what you feel like Evernote has to do. Because in order

602
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:47,205
Speaker 3:  for you to be able to like return that kind of information, you just need

603
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,165
Speaker 3:  a lot of stuff from me. Yeah.

604
00:36:50,265 --> 00:36:53,325
Speaker 4:  The cool thing is that you always have control over it. Right? So So I, if

605
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:57,045
Speaker 4:  you're not comfortable with sharing at the norm, your some document for instance,

606
00:36:57,065 --> 00:37:01,005
Speaker 4:  you can just not put it on Evernote or, or on any software and, and you it

607
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:04,765
Speaker 4:  won't be scanned, quote unquote. The other thing is that we take this stuff

608
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:08,285
Speaker 4:  incredibly seriously. So one of the reasons why we weren't

609
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:12,445
Speaker 4:  particularly bold into creating AI searches because we wanted to

610
00:37:12,445 --> 00:37:15,925
Speaker 4:  make sure that people who didn't want it on their content

611
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,965
Speaker 4:  could just not use it and not worry about it. Hmm. So that, that's one way

612
00:37:20,145 --> 00:37:24,085
Speaker 4:  to approach it of, I I think, I think we we're maybe a bit too conservative

613
00:37:24,185 --> 00:37:27,685
Speaker 4:  and, and too careful with it. But I think it's, it's a good attention to

614
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:28,445
Speaker 4:  have. So

615
00:37:28,635 --> 00:37:30,765
Speaker 3:  Wait, actually walk me through that. How do you put that in the product?

616
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:34,325
Speaker 3:  'cause again, you have a lot of people who use Evernote who Yeah. Are, have

617
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:37,605
Speaker 3:  been putting stuff into it, including in many cases very sensitive things.

618
00:37:37,675 --> 00:37:41,245
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like, you keep hearing about people who put all their passwords in

619
00:37:41,245 --> 00:37:44,445
Speaker 3:  Evernote and like, don't do that. People just don't, don't Yeah. Please don't,

620
00:37:44,455 --> 00:37:44,925
Speaker 3:  don't do that.

621
00:37:45,745 --> 00:37:48,925
Speaker 4:  Or at least use end-to-end encryption. Like there is an end-to-end encrypt

622
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:50,325
Speaker 4:  encryption feature on Evernote.

623
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:53,085
Speaker 3:  Okay. That's one If. you have to like, don't do that. Don't

624
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:53,325
Speaker 4:  Just

625
00:37:53,325 --> 00:37:57,285
Speaker 3:  Don't do that. Don't. But then so then to say, it's one thing to say,

626
00:37:57,285 --> 00:38:01,245
Speaker 3:  you know, we, we have a new layout for the, the formatting

627
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:04,605
Speaker 3:  buttons. It's another thing to say, we now have an AI tool Yep. That is going

628
00:38:04,605 --> 00:38:07,885
Speaker 3:  to index everything you've ever put into Evernote and make you and make it

629
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,805
Speaker 3:  searchable. There's gonna be a subset of people who are like, oh, neat. And

630
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:13,085
Speaker 3:  there's gonna be a subset of people who are like, you did what now? Yeah,

631
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:16,485
Speaker 3:  yeah. Like how do you, how do you sequence that for those people? How do

632
00:38:16,485 --> 00:38:19,085
Speaker 3:  you roll that out in a way that doesn't terrify two thirds of your users?

633
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:19,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

634
00:38:19,825 --> 00:38:23,805
Speaker 4:  So this is a great example on how we take

635
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:27,725
Speaker 4:  this seriously. So we literally didn't take this vision

636
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:31,525
Speaker 4:  to its full potential because we didn't want people to be scared

637
00:38:31,885 --> 00:38:35,565
Speaker 4:  and, and, and to be like frightened by what this could become.

638
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:40,045
Speaker 4:  So we work very careful in building it. So right now, the way it works is

639
00:38:40,425 --> 00:38:44,325
Speaker 4:  If, you don't opt in to use AI powered

640
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:44,605
Speaker 4:  search.

641
00:38:46,195 --> 00:38:49,805
Speaker 4:  Your notes are not shared with any sort of like third party ai,

642
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:53,645
Speaker 4:  which is an interesting approach because we could have said like, yeah, don't

643
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:57,285
Speaker 4:  worry. Like the, the privacy policy of this AI tool

644
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,845
Speaker 4:  is that they don't train anything on your, on your content, et cetera. So

645
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:04,445
Speaker 4:  you're, you're still safe. But, but it'll still do it. You know? So for,

646
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:07,805
Speaker 4:  for now it works like this. Now, now we're always trying to to, to ask people

647
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:11,765
Speaker 4:  what their feeling for these things are because it, it would be so useful.

648
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:16,165
Speaker 4:  So I'm, I'm, I'm curious to know if there is a way to build it

649
00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:19,965
Speaker 4:  in such a way that is, that it's both like, frictionless and it works

650
00:39:19,995 --> 00:39:23,645
Speaker 4:  like super well, super easy to use, et cetera,

651
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:28,085
Speaker 4:  and also remain super private and, and, and stuff like that. I think

652
00:39:28,085 --> 00:39:30,605
Speaker 4:  there are ways we, we just didn't have time yet to, to work. Do

653
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:33,205
Speaker 3:  You think there are ways? I'm not convinced there are ways, but I'm, I'm

654
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,285
Speaker 3:  glad to hear that you think there are,

655
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:38,245
Speaker 4:  Well for instance, If, you could run a model locally. You could do it

656
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:42,085
Speaker 4:  without sharing it with anybody else, which is one way to

657
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:45,165
Speaker 4:  protect it. So, so that at least you know that everything is still on your,

658
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:48,245
Speaker 4:  on your device. And it's not like there is one

659
00:39:49,135 --> 00:39:53,045
Speaker 4:  model that is ingesting everybody's content. That's one way.

660
00:39:53,065 --> 00:39:54,685
Speaker 4:  But there are maybe other ways. Yeah.

661
00:39:55,235 --> 00:39:58,325
Speaker 3:  Alright, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna talk about price.

662
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:54,085
Speaker 4:  like every widget is a different query for content that needs to

663
00:41:54,085 --> 00:41:58,045
Speaker 4:  be populated. So every section needs to be populated through a query.

664
00:41:58,665 --> 00:42:02,445
Speaker 4:  So one of the big reasons why we did it is because we wanted to make it faster,

665
00:42:02,575 --> 00:42:06,445
Speaker 4:  especially at launch. Like it was like, I think like

666
00:42:06,445 --> 00:42:10,245
Speaker 4:  four or five seconds on good devices to launch in the past, and now

667
00:42:10,245 --> 00:42:13,645
Speaker 4:  it's down to like less than a second on some, some good devices. So that's,

668
00:42:13,645 --> 00:42:17,445
Speaker 4:  that's a big thing. So the other thing is just like technology,

669
00:42:17,505 --> 00:42:20,685
Speaker 4:  you, we, we need to improve the technology and we are, we did like for, for

670
00:42:20,685 --> 00:42:24,405
Speaker 4:  the, for the whole last year. And we're still doing, like, as I told you

671
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:28,045
Speaker 4:  today, we are launching a rent, which is this new synchronization engine,

672
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:32,045
Speaker 4:  which also speeds up synchronization. So yeah, it, it's basically, it comes

673
00:42:32,045 --> 00:42:34,405
Speaker 4:  down to the technology that you have and, and the way it works,

674
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:38,165
Speaker 3:  I mean, there's nothing work to do the answer. Like, I both believe you and

675
00:42:39,095 --> 00:42:41,485
Speaker 3:  still don't care. And I still think all the apps should be faster. I know.

676
00:42:41,485 --> 00:42:45,165
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Is speed a trade off to some of this other stuff that you're

677
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:48,645
Speaker 3:  thinking about? Like does as you build in all these new features and bring

678
00:42:48,645 --> 00:42:52,045
Speaker 3:  in lots of new kinds of stuff and activities people can do, like, you know,

679
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:55,645
Speaker 3:  you mentioned every widget on the homepage adds more response time.

680
00:42:55,755 --> 00:42:59,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Is, does all of that stuff fight against

681
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:00,605
Speaker 3:  making the app faster?

682
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,045
Speaker 4:  Not necessarily, but I'll give you an a close example. So

683
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:09,645
Speaker 4:  there's this trade off of I want everyone to be faster, but

684
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:13,405
Speaker 4:  also for some reason I'm running like Meco S

685
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:18,765
Speaker 4:  13 and for my own understandable reason, reasons I

686
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:22,165
Speaker 4:  don't want to abandon that. And so that prevents us

687
00:43:22,595 --> 00:43:26,565
Speaker 4:  from abandoning that that os if there are, like, if there's

688
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:30,485
Speaker 4:  a mini meaningful number of people using it, So, I, it's not like to

689
00:43:30,485 --> 00:43:34,125
Speaker 4:  have an excuse. I'm, I'm saying that there are a lot of things that we could

690
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:37,445
Speaker 4:  do, even though there are no trade-offs and, and we are doing them, but in

691
00:43:37,445 --> 00:43:40,725
Speaker 4:  some cases there are trade-offs. And so we always have to balance, okay,

692
00:43:40,725 --> 00:43:43,885
Speaker 4:  like how many people are we preventing from using Evernote in the future

693
00:43:44,345 --> 00:43:48,165
Speaker 4:  in order to be able to update a library that drops support

694
00:43:48,185 --> 00:43:51,445
Speaker 4:  for that operating system. You, you see? So, so it's kind of complex many

695
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:51,565
Speaker 4:  times.

696
00:43:51,915 --> 00:43:55,765
Speaker 3:  Okay. And then the other thing is the price. Yeah. Most of

697
00:43:55,765 --> 00:43:58,525
Speaker 3:  the people who are mad at Evernote, especially right now, are mad because

698
00:43:58,525 --> 00:44:01,445
Speaker 3:  you just changed the price. Mm. Yeah. And you just changed what people get

699
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:05,605
Speaker 3:  who don't pay for Evernote. And the number of people who are like, I haven't

700
00:44:05,605 --> 00:44:08,605
Speaker 3:  been paying for Evernote, I've been using it for 15 years. Yeah. And now

701
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:12,525
Speaker 3:  I'm quitting because they're charging me money. I have found myself wondering,

702
00:44:13,065 --> 00:44:15,925
Speaker 3:  If, you are sitting there being like, yes. Yes. Precisely. That's the point.

703
00:44:15,985 --> 00:44:19,925
Speaker 3:  We have to make money. If, you use this for free. We're just losing

704
00:44:19,925 --> 00:44:23,365
Speaker 3:  money. Part of what you did in a big way when you bought Evernote was you

705
00:44:23,365 --> 00:44:26,445
Speaker 3:  changed the business model, right? Like, it, it it charges very differently

706
00:44:26,445 --> 00:44:30,285
Speaker 3:  than it did. Yeah. The free tier is very different than it was. How do you

707
00:44:30,285 --> 00:44:34,245
Speaker 3:  think through the business, especially for individual note taking, which

708
00:44:34,345 --> 00:44:38,045
Speaker 3:  as we talked about is a business a lot of people run away from because they

709
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:41,445
Speaker 3:  just can't figure it out. Yeah. How do you think about what it takes to make

710
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:42,325
Speaker 3:  that a business right now?

711
00:44:42,795 --> 00:44:43,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

712
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:48,125
Speaker 4:  I empathize with, with, with those people because it's not something that

713
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:52,085
Speaker 4:  I don't understand, right? So we all use many different software

714
00:44:52,085 --> 00:44:55,605
Speaker 4:  products and it's not like we are happy when, when prices increase

715
00:44:56,305 --> 00:45:00,165
Speaker 4:  and sim applies to me. So it's not like we are here saying, yeah, we're going

716
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:03,125
Speaker 4:  to raise the price and it's going to be great. It, it's more about

717
00:45:03,805 --> 00:45:07,685
Speaker 4:  identifying the way to make everyone the most successful that we can in

718
00:45:07,685 --> 00:45:11,485
Speaker 4:  order for it to be sustainable so that we can guarantee

719
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:14,325
Speaker 4:  the glorious future. That that's the point. Right? The, the whole reason

720
00:45:14,385 --> 00:45:18,045
Speaker 4:  we increase prices is so that anot would be, would have a

721
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:21,285
Speaker 4:  glorious future in looking ahead. And so

722
00:45:22,075 --> 00:45:25,765
Speaker 4:  what we try to do in this situation is, is to be, is to have like a rigorous

723
00:45:26,085 --> 00:45:30,045
Speaker 4:  scientific approach where we If you think of the extremes.

724
00:45:30,265 --> 00:45:34,165
Speaker 4:  If, you charge $0, everybody's going to be happy, but then

725
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:37,965
Speaker 4:  Evernote is going to be dead very soon. Yes. If, you charge a

726
00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:41,085
Speaker 4:  thousand dollars per month, nobody's going to use, use Evernote anymore.

727
00:45:41,345 --> 00:45:45,325
Speaker 4:  And, and, and so it'll die too. So of course you have to find a

728
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:49,125
Speaker 4:  balance. What I mean that we try to be scientific is that Evernotes

729
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:53,005
Speaker 4:  prices weren't traced for seven years before we, before we adjusted the

730
00:45:53,005 --> 00:45:56,565
Speaker 4:  pricing. And so we tried to rebalance that in a way

731
00:45:56,995 --> 00:46:00,965
Speaker 4:  that basically tempted to piss off the lowest amount

732
00:46:00,965 --> 00:46:04,725
Speaker 4:  of people that we could while increasing the,

733
00:46:04,785 --> 00:46:08,405
Speaker 4:  the everyone revenue as much as we could. And so we had to

734
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:11,525
Speaker 4:  identify that, that that delicate balance and, and, and we take this stuff

735
00:46:11,525 --> 00:46:14,245
Speaker 4:  very seriously because it's not like we're happy when we read people who

736
00:46:14,245 --> 00:46:17,125
Speaker 4:  are pissed at Evernote. Right. And so that, that's what, what, that was a

737
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:21,045
Speaker 4:  tricky thing to do. But eventually the the cool thing, I can

738
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:24,885
Speaker 4:  give you two interesting data points. Maybe. One thing is when

739
00:46:25,065 --> 00:46:28,885
Speaker 4:  we talk to customers as, as I told you, it's so cool to observe how

740
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:32,845
Speaker 4:  reasonable they are. Like most people we talk to who use Evernet

741
00:46:32,885 --> 00:46:36,845
Speaker 4:  a lot, they're saying, yeah, I saw the new prices. It's not like I'm

742
00:46:36,845 --> 00:46:40,765
Speaker 4:  happy about it. It's, it's okay. I get a lot of value out of

743
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:44,685
Speaker 4:  Evernet far more than, than what you charge me. Now. Let's

744
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:47,925
Speaker 4:  go back to talking about how we can make evernet better. Sure. You look like

745
00:46:47,925 --> 00:46:51,725
Speaker 4:  they, they very quickly the conversation shifts to Yeah, but

746
00:46:51,955 --> 00:46:55,885
Speaker 4:  okay, the, the price is, is fine, but let's talk about how to improve ever

747
00:46:55,885 --> 00:46:56,325
Speaker 4:  ornot. Right.

748
00:46:56,325 --> 00:46:58,685
Speaker 3:  Which is the conversation I'm sure you want to be having, right. Where it's

749
00:46:58,685 --> 00:47:02,645
Speaker 3:  like, yes, how make it worth my money. Exactly. Let's go. Exactly.

750
00:47:02,675 --> 00:47:06,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah, exactly. The other data point is the numbers.

751
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:10,645
Speaker 4:  So when we look at how many people like left Evernote

752
00:47:10,645 --> 00:47:13,765
Speaker 4:  versus not, et cetera, of course we, we, we are always looking at, at that

753
00:47:13,765 --> 00:47:17,485
Speaker 4:  number in order to make these decisions. And the cool thing is that

754
00:47:17,605 --> 00:47:21,485
Speaker 4:  Evernote retention has never been higher than today. So Yeah, of course like

755
00:47:21,485 --> 00:47:24,485
Speaker 4:  If you If you look on Reddit, you, you might imagine something different.

756
00:47:24,665 --> 00:47:28,445
Speaker 4:  But actually like the, the situation is kind of good. So

757
00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:28,925
Speaker 4:  yeah.

758
00:47:29,705 --> 00:47:32,645
Speaker 3:  So are you gonna raise the price more then? Did you go too low? No,

759
00:47:32,645 --> 00:47:33,605
Speaker 4:  We, we don't have, did

760
00:47:33,605 --> 00:47:34,365
Speaker 3:  You have lost a few more people

761
00:47:34,765 --> 00:47:35,605
Speaker 4:  Concrete plans Okay.

762
00:47:35,825 --> 00:47:38,485
Speaker 3:  To do that? Well, part of the reason I ask is I think we're, we're in a moment

763
00:47:38,485 --> 00:47:42,325
Speaker 3:  right now where a, everything is becoming a subscription. And so subscription

764
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:46,245
Speaker 3:  fatigue is pretty real. Yeah. And b, all the prices seem to go up all

765
00:47:46,245 --> 00:47:50,125
Speaker 3:  the time. Yeah. And, and I think there is a sense of, I'd be willing

766
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:53,885
Speaker 3:  to pay for this, but the more I invest in it, the more

767
00:47:54,865 --> 00:47:58,405
Speaker 3:  you as the company are going to be able to essentially

768
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:02,205
Speaker 3:  like, blackmail me out of my money because you have all my stuff. And the

769
00:48:02,205 --> 00:48:05,565
Speaker 3:  harder it is to get out, the more you're gonna be able to take from me before

770
00:48:05,565 --> 00:48:09,165
Speaker 3:  I'm willing to leave. And I think the, the fear of that trade is very real

771
00:48:09,525 --> 00:48:12,165
Speaker 3:  because people keep going through it, right? Like, yeah. I sign up for a

772
00:48:12,165 --> 00:48:15,725
Speaker 3:  streaming service and I've, I've been using Spotify for 10 years and Spotify

773
00:48:15,795 --> 00:48:19,565
Speaker 3:  gets more expensive like every 15 minutes now. Yeah. And it sucks, but

774
00:48:19,725 --> 00:48:23,285
Speaker 3:  I don't leave because it would be a giant pain, the leave Spotify. And that

775
00:48:23,335 --> 00:48:26,965
Speaker 3:  feels bad. Yeah. And I think with something like Evernote, especially,

776
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:30,965
Speaker 3:  you've gone through all this change recently and like, do you, do you get

777
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:34,325
Speaker 3:  to the point where you say, okay, we've, we've done this, this is how we

778
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:38,085
Speaker 3:  set this thing up, it was a painful change, and now we're going to, we're

779
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:41,885
Speaker 3:  going to stop making those changes. Or does it make sense

780
00:48:41,945 --> 00:48:45,925
Speaker 3:  to say, you know, we're, we're gonna do this slowly and raise prices as we

781
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:49,805
Speaker 3:  need to, but try to make it kind of less painful each time? Yeah. Like

782
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:52,645
Speaker 3:  the, it's the sort of rip the bandaid off approach versus like, hope nobody

783
00:48:52,645 --> 00:48:54,125
Speaker 3:  notices when you raise prices a dollar.

784
00:48:54,505 --> 00:48:58,325
Speaker 4:  No, it's, it's generally expensive, quote unquote, to raise

785
00:48:58,325 --> 00:49:02,285
Speaker 4:  prices because you don't want to piss people off and, and, and so

786
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,725
Speaker 4:  you want to do it the

787
00:49:06,415 --> 00:49:10,405
Speaker 4:  fewer times you can. So, so we did it once and we hope

788
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:14,165
Speaker 4:  to be good for, for, for years now, so, fair enough. So that, that's the

789
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,485
Speaker 4:  approach. Of course, like every, every once in a while, every service needs

790
00:49:17,485 --> 00:49:21,245
Speaker 4:  to adjust prices even just for inflation, you know, every once in a while

791
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:25,045
Speaker 4:  like it compounds. And so it becomes important after, after

792
00:49:25,205 --> 00:49:29,045
Speaker 4:  a few years. But yeah, they're like, the other thing is that

793
00:49:29,065 --> 00:49:32,725
Speaker 4:  I'm pretty optimistic about how this kind of things

794
00:49:33,205 --> 00:49:36,085
Speaker 4:  balances itself. Like competition is strong

795
00:49:37,155 --> 00:49:40,485
Speaker 4:  both on note taking, but also on, on other softwares. And

796
00:49:40,865 --> 00:49:44,365
Speaker 4:  people are starting to build a sense for, for how to handle these things.

797
00:49:44,465 --> 00:49:48,445
Speaker 4:  So I don't think there's the case where you can just like sneak

798
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:51,845
Speaker 4:  in a price increase and people will not notice. That's true. I, I think,

799
00:49:51,885 --> 00:49:55,485
Speaker 4:  I think people will, people notice and, and will notice and

800
00:49:55,675 --> 00:49:59,645
Speaker 4:  they will be, I'm very optimistic that people know how

801
00:49:59,645 --> 00:50:03,285
Speaker 4:  much value they're getting out of a product and, and they are kind of intentional

802
00:50:03,305 --> 00:50:07,005
Speaker 4:  in how they behave and, and if they want to stay subscribed versus

803
00:50:07,105 --> 00:50:07,325
Speaker 4:  not.

804
00:50:07,545 --> 00:50:09,725
Speaker 3:  How competitive does this space feel to you right now?

805
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:11,885
Speaker 4:  Hmm. This, it's,

806
00:50:13,985 --> 00:50:17,845
Speaker 4:  we see it as not very competitive because we focus a lot

807
00:50:17,845 --> 00:50:21,165
Speaker 4:  on our customers. Okay. and we try to build stuff because

808
00:50:21,715 --> 00:50:25,245
Speaker 4:  they need it, rather than, oh, look what the other product is doing, we should

809
00:50:25,245 --> 00:50:28,845
Speaker 4:  build that. At the same time, there's no denying that, that there are a lot

810
00:50:28,845 --> 00:50:32,525
Speaker 4:  of products that, that compete in the same arena.

811
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:36,445
Speaker 4:  So we need to be careful about both things. The cool thing is that by

812
00:50:36,445 --> 00:50:40,205
Speaker 4:  using the, the approach of only caring about our customers,

813
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:43,925
Speaker 4:  quote unquote, is that you can build something unique. So,

814
00:50:43,985 --> 00:50:47,605
Speaker 4:  so you don't need to, you don't necessarily need to participate to the race,

815
00:50:47,775 --> 00:50:48,445
Speaker 4:  which is cool.

816
00:50:48,985 --> 00:50:51,325
Speaker 3:  Who else do you look at that you feel like is doing cool stuff right now?

817
00:50:52,565 --> 00:50:56,405
Speaker 4:  I take a lot of inspiration from stuff that is

818
00:50:56,585 --> 00:51:00,125
Speaker 4:  not necessarily note taking software. Okay. So for instance, I'm a big fan

819
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:02,245
Speaker 4:  of Slack and, and oh

820
00:51:02,245 --> 00:51:04,045
Speaker 3:  My God, you are gonna build work chat again. No,

821
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:07,965
Speaker 4:  Don't, again, I, I I don't think we are,

822
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:11,245
Speaker 4:  I I I think there's very little reason to do that. Okay. Especially because

823
00:51:11,245 --> 00:51:14,325
Speaker 4:  like getting a feature parity or even just like to a reasonable

824
00:51:14,975 --> 00:51:18,765
Speaker 4:  percentage of the, the features set that that softwares like Slack have is

825
00:51:18,765 --> 00:51:21,765
Speaker 4:  hard. So I, I don't think I want to compete with them, but like for instance

826
00:51:21,855 --> 00:51:25,365
Speaker 4:  slash comments, it's such a great UX

827
00:51:25,795 --> 00:51:29,405
Speaker 4:  that it's just like obvious that every software should have it.

828
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:32,805
Speaker 4:  Another thing I'm a big fan of is like, you know, I don't know how it's called

829
00:51:32,805 --> 00:51:36,205
Speaker 4:  maybe Quick Switcher, you know how on Slack you, you hit like CMDK and it,

830
00:51:36,265 --> 00:51:39,525
Speaker 4:  you can, you can like switch from, from one channel to the other. The same

831
00:51:39,525 --> 00:51:43,085
Speaker 4:  thing exists on, on Evernote. It's just CMDJ instead of K

832
00:51:43,265 --> 00:51:46,165
Speaker 3:  And it should be J everywhere by the way, to anyone who's listening, do you

833
00:51:46,165 --> 00:51:49,485
Speaker 3:  think So it should be J because K is how you insert links in most apps. Okay.

834
00:51:49,745 --> 00:51:53,325
Speaker 3:  And it should be, it j should be for switching. Yeah. K should be for links.

835
00:51:53,425 --> 00:51:55,005
Speaker 4:  You, you don't know how many people have tell

836
00:51:55,075 --> 00:51:58,205
Speaker 3:  Have deep religion on this. There are a lot of people who believe it's K

837
00:51:58,265 --> 00:52:02,005
Speaker 3:  and they're wrong. We can switch links if we want to, but

838
00:52:02,065 --> 00:52:04,925
Speaker 3:  one should be J and one should be K. Yeah. And the fact that one is K when

839
00:52:04,925 --> 00:52:07,365
Speaker 3:  you have some text selected and the other one is K when you don't have tech

840
00:52:07,565 --> 00:52:09,165
Speaker 3:  selected. Yeah. Bad ui.

841
00:52:09,565 --> 00:52:12,765
Speaker 4:  I agree. I I I think it should be the same everywhere. I, I I don't have

842
00:52:12,765 --> 00:52:14,925
Speaker 4:  any strong opinion on which one it should be. Then

843
00:52:14,925 --> 00:52:16,645
Speaker 3:  It should be J get on board with me. Let's

844
00:52:16,645 --> 00:52:17,445
Speaker 4:  Do this team

845
00:52:17,445 --> 00:52:18,045
Speaker 3:  Command J

846
00:52:18,075 --> 00:52:20,125
Speaker 4:  It's already J so that's everyone is good. Perfect.

847
00:52:21,685 --> 00:52:24,325
Speaker 4:  I think it could be even more powerful. So first of all, people don't know

848
00:52:24,325 --> 00:52:27,685
Speaker 4:  about it and, and, and I think it's so powerful that they should, and So

849
00:52:28,165 --> 00:52:30,885
Speaker 4:  I would like for people to know about it. The second thing is that I think

850
00:52:30,885 --> 00:52:34,005
Speaker 4:  it could do so much more, like right now on Evernote, you can use the quick

851
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:38,085
Speaker 4:  switcher to navigate to a note or, or, or or

852
00:52:38,085 --> 00:52:41,365
Speaker 4:  something like that. But I think you could use it to like delete a note for

853
00:52:41,485 --> 00:52:45,085
Speaker 4:  instance, like you are inside a note, CM DJ Dell, you, you write like

854
00:52:45,205 --> 00:52:48,605
Speaker 4:  DEL and, and you hit enter and it deletes the note and you can, you could

855
00:52:48,605 --> 00:52:51,805
Speaker 4:  do like a bunch of different things with that like share or or something

856
00:52:51,805 --> 00:52:51,965
Speaker 4:  like that.

857
00:52:52,425 --> 00:52:55,725
Speaker 3:  That's a cool idea. Yeah. That's another one that like, you know, you mentioned

858
00:52:55,785 --> 00:52:59,245
Speaker 3:  the, the kind of universal slash command thing that's starting to happen.

859
00:52:59,835 --> 00:53:03,485
Speaker 3:  That sort of thing is starting to happen more and more places where you bring

860
00:53:03,485 --> 00:53:06,805
Speaker 3:  up the kind of universal command bar Yeah. And it lets you do

861
00:53:06,805 --> 00:53:07,485
Speaker 4:  Stuff. Exactly.

862
00:53:07,645 --> 00:53:08,525
Speaker 3:  I think that's very cool. Yeah.

863
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:12,405
Speaker 4:  Like recast, right? Yeah, exactly. I'm a huge fan of Alfred ku and

864
00:53:12,435 --> 00:53:13,205
Speaker 4:  that archetype. Yeah.

865
00:53:13,265 --> 00:53:16,965
Speaker 3:  But that is the kind of stuff that is so power usy

866
00:53:17,745 --> 00:53:21,005
Speaker 3:  and I think about a lot of people who use tools like Evernote who are the

867
00:53:21,005 --> 00:53:24,885
Speaker 3:  folks who are like Yeah. Not even necessarily learning the keyboard

868
00:53:25,325 --> 00:53:28,365
Speaker 3:  shortcuts for like copy and paste. Yeah. Right. Like most people

869
00:53:29,255 --> 00:53:33,085
Speaker 3:  don't do that stuff. Yeah. And So I think with

870
00:53:33,105 --> 00:53:35,485
Speaker 3:  any tool like this and, and it goes back to kinda what you're saying about

871
00:53:35,485 --> 00:53:39,205
Speaker 3:  customization, trying to build something that starts very simply Yes.

872
00:53:39,465 --> 00:53:43,325
Speaker 3:  And then scales all the way up to what the most power users want. Yeah. It's

873
00:53:43,525 --> 00:53:47,365
Speaker 3:  like that's the dream. But I feel like from a, from a actual

874
00:53:47,715 --> 00:53:51,685
Speaker 3:  interface perspective, it's so easy to make that into

875
00:53:51,685 --> 00:53:54,005
Speaker 3:  just a gigantic mess. Yeah. That actually helps. No one,

876
00:53:54,685 --> 00:53:58,485
Speaker 4:  I think in that direction I think we did kind of, well the mobile navigation,

877
00:53:58,645 --> 00:54:01,845
Speaker 4:  I think that you want to give a, a good default

878
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:06,325
Speaker 4:  that, that people who are not power users and don't care about

879
00:54:06,325 --> 00:54:09,525
Speaker 4:  being power users, they can still use it in a satisfying way.

880
00:54:10,145 --> 00:54:14,045
Speaker 4:  And then you can customize it. If you're a power user and you don't want

881
00:54:14,145 --> 00:54:17,565
Speaker 4:  the create page to be your default homepage, then you can just customize

882
00:54:17,565 --> 00:54:21,525
Speaker 4:  it and make it so that the note list is your, is your homepage. And it took

883
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:24,605
Speaker 4:  a while to to, to nail it because I think we tested

884
00:54:25,675 --> 00:54:29,365
Speaker 4:  nine different iterations, I think Wow. Of, of the new navigation and

885
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:33,165
Speaker 4:  homepage. And then after those nine iterations, then we added

886
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:37,525
Speaker 4:  the, the customization setting. So you can, you can customize

887
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:41,285
Speaker 4:  which page opens when you launch the app and, and how the nav bar looks.

888
00:54:41,285 --> 00:54:44,285
Speaker 4:  You can like switch between notebooks and shortcuts in the nav bar. So I.

889
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:47,365
Speaker 4:  I think that's a good approach. It's not necessarily perfect or finished

890
00:54:47,425 --> 00:54:51,285
Speaker 4:  yet, but it's, it's good. I think that we should aim at doing the same thing

891
00:54:51,285 --> 00:54:54,165
Speaker 4:  everywhere. Like where you have for every feature you have a strong default

892
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:58,165
Speaker 4:  and then those who want more customization can customize it. Okay.

893
00:54:58,325 --> 00:55:02,085
Speaker 3:  I buy that. So it feels like you're, you're, you're in a good place where

894
00:55:02,115 --> 00:55:06,045
Speaker 3:  kind of the basic infrastructure of Evernote is in a,

895
00:55:06,045 --> 00:55:08,805
Speaker 3:  in a solid place. You've built a bunch of new stuff, you've shipped a bunch

896
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:12,325
Speaker 3:  of new stuff. As you think to like the next 18 months,

897
00:55:12,995 --> 00:55:16,645
Speaker 3:  what are some of the big, not, you don't have to tell me about

898
00:55:16,925 --> 00:55:20,685
Speaker 3:  features, you can if you'd like to, but sort of big picture things that are

899
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:23,645
Speaker 3:  like top of your mind right now. Either the things that are still at the

900
00:55:23,645 --> 00:55:26,605
Speaker 3:  top of the list that customers are asking you for, or just like interesting

901
00:55:26,605 --> 00:55:28,645
Speaker 3:  things you wanna work on in the next year or so. Yeah.

902
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:32,565
Speaker 4:  Any note taking software, but especially ever note needs to like nail the

903
00:55:32,565 --> 00:55:36,525
Speaker 4:  basic really well and it doesn't do it every

904
00:55:36,525 --> 00:55:40,205
Speaker 4:  time. And I would like it to be perfect every time. And then you have collaboration

905
00:55:40,205 --> 00:55:43,805
Speaker 4:  and ai I think both are promising. Both are not, they're, they're not

906
00:55:43,805 --> 00:55:47,045
Speaker 4:  necessarily core to evernet, So, I. I would like to split between things

907
00:55:47,045 --> 00:55:50,445
Speaker 4:  that are like core and sort of non-negotiable.

908
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:54,125
Speaker 4:  Almost like, like the two that we just mentioned. And then things that if

909
00:55:54,195 --> 00:55:57,885
Speaker 4:  done well could be very cool and you kind of want both,

910
00:55:57,885 --> 00:56:01,205
Speaker 4:  right? You want stuff that that's non-negotiable to be done perfectly. And

911
00:56:01,205 --> 00:56:04,885
Speaker 4:  then you want some stuff that that's just cool and you want to have it in

912
00:56:04,885 --> 00:56:08,245
Speaker 4:  in your, in your tools. Totally. And so stuff like one click sharing,

913
00:56:08,585 --> 00:56:12,405
Speaker 3:  Do you think any of those things are the thing

914
00:56:12,405 --> 00:56:16,365
Speaker 3:  that go out and get all the people who don't use a Notes app? 'cause

915
00:56:16,365 --> 00:56:20,325
Speaker 3:  I think like it's, it's easy to forget when you care about this stuff that

916
00:56:20,325 --> 00:56:24,165
Speaker 3:  most people don't. Yeah. And that most people don't use any of these tools.

917
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:28,365
Speaker 3:  They just live in chaos. Yeah. And like monsters and I don't like

918
00:56:28,365 --> 00:56:31,645
Speaker 3:  any of them. You just like live your life with a million open tabs until

919
00:56:31,645 --> 00:56:35,405
Speaker 3:  your computer falls apart and there you're So I think like, is

920
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:39,325
Speaker 3:  is the next phase of this. Like, if AI search

921
00:56:39,325 --> 00:56:43,245
Speaker 3:  gets really good, maybe that's how we start to get to those people. Like,

922
00:56:43,245 --> 00:56:46,125
Speaker 3:  have you started thinking about the non Evernote users much yet?

923
00:56:46,275 --> 00:56:50,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think for them the most important thing is, as we were saying, ease

924
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:53,125
Speaker 4:  of use and a strong default. Okay. I, I think that

925
00:56:53,835 --> 00:56:57,525
Speaker 4:  they were not trying Evernote because it was a bit cumbersome to learn.

926
00:56:57,755 --> 00:57:01,605
Speaker 4:  Like you land on Evernote and then if the first thing you see is a page

927
00:57:01,605 --> 00:57:05,365
Speaker 4:  with widgets and you're expecting to, to write notes, you're, you're a bit

928
00:57:05,365 --> 00:57:08,605
Speaker 4:  like uncomfortable. You, you're thinking, yeah, how do I write a note here

929
00:57:09,145 --> 00:57:13,005
Speaker 4:  and, and like why is it so complicated? So I think that in order to attract

930
00:57:13,005 --> 00:57:16,525
Speaker 4:  them you need to have strong use cases that they might not find elsewhere,

931
00:57:16,585 --> 00:57:20,405
Speaker 4:  but especially like a very good user, user experience. And so we are also

932
00:57:20,405 --> 00:57:21,405
Speaker 4:  working on that. Alright.

933
00:57:21,545 --> 00:57:24,205
Speaker 3:  I'm excited to try it. Yeah. All right, well we should go. But thank you
