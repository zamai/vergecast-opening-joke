Description: Today’s Future of Music episode comes from Ariel Shapiro, The Verge’s lead reporter of HotPod, our weekly newsletter about the audio industry. Last week on the show we talked about old music… specifically how the back catalog is a big part of what makes “new” music. This week Ariel picks up right where we left off, with the revival of stars from the past on platforms like TikTok. But what about new… undiscovered talent? Is that even a thing anymore? Can a budding artist find their place in the world of viral video? Ariel explores the complicated relationship between musicians and platforms.

Speaker 2:  Welcome

3
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,480
Speaker 3:  To the Vergecast the flagship podcast of four on the floor. I'm your friend,

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,440
Speaker 3:  David Pierce. And this is the second part in our mini series. All about the

5
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,080
Speaker 3:  future of music. Today's episode comes from Ariel Shapiro, who is the verges

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,720
Speaker 3:  lead reporter of Hotpod, which is our weekly newsletter about the audio industry.

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,640
Speaker 3:  It's awesome. You should subscribe. Last week on the show, we talked about

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,560
Speaker 3:  old music specifically how the back catalog is a big part of

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,440
Speaker 3:  what makes new music this week. Ariel picks up right where we

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,400
Speaker 3:  left off with the revival of stars from the past on new platforms

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,880
Speaker 3:  like TikTok. But what about new undiscovered

12
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,960
Speaker 3:  talent? Is that even a thing anymore? Can a budding artist

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,800
Speaker 3:  find their place in this weird new world of viral video? It's more

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,880
Speaker 3:  complicated than you think, but I'll let Ariel explain. Let's go.

15
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,520
Speaker 4:  The powers that be anticipated, music streaming a lot earlier

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,360
Speaker 4:  than you might think back in 1995, before my

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,120
Speaker 4:  parents even had a CD player in their Subaru, the late Senator

18
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,000
Speaker 4:  Oren hatch pushed through a bill that would extend music copyright to the

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,880
Speaker 4:  digital space. He emphasized the rise of what legal circles

20
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,600
Speaker 4:  then referred to as the celestial jukebox, a

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,200
Speaker 4:  surprisingly poetic term for a tool that would allow listeners to access

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,120
Speaker 4:  any music they wanted at any time. The tech available

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,880
Speaker 4:  at the time was nowhere near that. This is before even Napster

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,680
Speaker 4:  entered the scene, but it was on the horizon. For the most part.

25
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,800
Speaker 4:  The promise of the celestial jukebox has been realized

26
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,920
Speaker 4:  practically, any song is available with the tap of a finger, maybe

27
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,840
Speaker 4:  for $10 a month, or maybe for nothing at all. If you're willing to sit through

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,680
Speaker 4:  ads, people are listening to more music than ever before. In the

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,520
Speaker 4:  first six months of the year, consumer streamed songs,

30
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,400
Speaker 4:  2.5 trillion times. And if you

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,240
Speaker 4:  ever dreamed of being a rock star, a rapper or a pop queen, it

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,160
Speaker 4:  has never been easier to make and share your tracks. Anyone with a

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,960
Speaker 4:  song in their heart, a laptop and a subscription to tune core could

34
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,760
Speaker 4:  upload their stuff right alongside Beyonce. It should be a golden age

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,450
Speaker 4:  for music. And yet many of the artists reaping

36
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,330
Speaker 4:  the benefits of this new landscape are not who you would expect,

37
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,170
Speaker 4:  like Fleetwood Mac going viral on TikTok. Thanks to Nathan

38
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,010
Speaker 4:  Apodaca cruising on his skateboard. Half gallon of ocean spray in hand,

39
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,890
Speaker 4:  simply vibing to dreams

40
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,760
Speaker 4:  or Kate Bush, the art pop queen of the 1980s, who finally

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,680
Speaker 4:  got her due when a well placed spin of running up that hill in

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,440
Speaker 4:  stranger things catapulted the song to the top of the billboard charts

43
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,160
Speaker 4:  or the 81 year old Paul ANCA whose 1959

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,040
Speaker 4:  classic put your head on my shoulder was remixed and slowed down

45
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,480
Speaker 4:  for a sexy silhouette challenge on TikTok.

46
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,640
Speaker 2:  Put your head on my show.

47
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,200
Speaker 4:  The remix has appeared in over 600,000 videos on

48
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,160
Speaker 4:  the platform, but if streaming is reviving the

49
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,800
Speaker 4:  stars of the past, how do aspiring stars fair in the new music

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,360
Speaker 4:  landscape?

51
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,440
Speaker 4:  More new music is flooding the platforms than ever before. And plenty

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,200
Speaker 4:  of amateur musicians go viral. They have a moment maybe even a hit

53
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,280
Speaker 4:  and then they fade as quickly as they rose. And that's not just my

54
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,120
Speaker 4:  elder millennial negativity. That's in the data. According to

55
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,080
Speaker 4:  illuminate the research firm behind Billboard's charts, the amount of time

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,040
Speaker 4:  consumers spent listening to new music declined 1.4%,

57
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,760
Speaker 4:  even as listening to older music or catalog jumped

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,840
Speaker 4:  19%, there are also simply fewer hits to stream

59
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,240
Speaker 4:  in the first place. In the second quarter of

60
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,120
Speaker 4:  twenty twenty one, a hundred and twenty

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,800
Speaker 4:  six new albums debuted on the billboard 200

62
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,760
Speaker 4:  during the

63
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,080
Speaker 4:  same period in 2022, only 102 did. So what gives,

64
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,760
Speaker 5:  I think discovery is the biggest challenge for certainly for new artists.

65
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,600
Speaker 4:  Rob Jonas is the CEO of illuminate and worked on the study.

66
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,480
Speaker 5:  There's been lots of coverage in recent months around the number of new

67
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,360
Speaker 5:  songs per day. We're now seeing about 74,000 new songs a day right now

68
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,960
Speaker 5:  coming into different platforms. It's just very, very hard to get discovered

69
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,720
Speaker 5:  and breakthrough right now, probably harder than ever. One thing we hear

70
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,440
Speaker 5:  consistently is they're struggling with the fact that they have to be always

71
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,800
Speaker 5:  creating new pieces of content, right? So it's not just around creating music

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,720
Speaker 5:  anymore. It's like, how do I create something that's relevant for this platform

73
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,600
Speaker 5:  or this platform? It's a continuous marketing challenge and content creation

74
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,280
Speaker 5:  challenge, because there's so much out there. They have to make sure they're

75
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,680
Speaker 5:  top of mind and relevant all the time.

76
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,880
Speaker 4:  Was it always this way in the late two thousands, early

77
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,440
Speaker 4:  2010s, it seemed possible for artists to get big on the internet

78
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,320
Speaker 4:  because artists were getting big on the internet and a good chunk of

79
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,880
Speaker 4:  them became bonafide stars. YouTube gave us Justin Bieber

80
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,600
Speaker 4:  and the weekend

81
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,640
Speaker 4:  my space gave us Taylor swift

82
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,320
Speaker 2:  Is we young and,

83
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,640
Speaker 4:  And Adele Adele,

84
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,080
Speaker 4:  before we go on a disclosure of bias, I was in my late

85
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,040
Speaker 4:  teens during that time, which means the music that I found on my space

86
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,720
Speaker 4:  that populated my turquoise iPod mini, for which I paid

87
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,680
Speaker 4:  a full 99 cents per song will forever be

88
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,400
Speaker 4:  burned into my brain. I can't remember where I put my wallet at any

89
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,120
Speaker 4:  given time, but I still know the harmonies of menos despite

90
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,080
Speaker 4:  having listened to fleet foxes, maybe a few times in the past

91
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,600
Speaker 4:  decade, that being said, there seemed to be something objectively special

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,360
Speaker 4:  about what was happening on MySpace and the industry knew it. Courtney

93
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,960
Speaker 4:  halt saw it firsthand as an executive at Interscope gin.

94
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,040
Speaker 6:  MySpace was the first time that I really saw artists and fans coexisting

95
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,960
Speaker 6:  in a space for me, it's sort of replicated that idea of seeing a

96
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,880
Speaker 6:  band you loved in a small club before they were big. So I don't know

97
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,560
Speaker 6:  how I could describe it other than it was just a feeling I had. I don't remember

98
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,720
Speaker 6:  something feeling like that in the music industry. Hadn't felt like that

99
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,240
Speaker 6:  in a long time.

100
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,480
Speaker 4:  My space was such a hot music destination that MTV wanted to buy

101
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,360
Speaker 4:  it before being undercut by Rupert Murdoch's news court

102
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,400
Speaker 7:  News Corp has been, I think, smart enough to let us continue to do

103
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,280
Speaker 7:  what we do and really keep hands off, which is not typical for a big

104
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,680
Speaker 7:  corporation like that. You sort of expect them to screw it up.

105
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,160
Speaker 4:  It continued to grow. And in 2007 had

106
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,000
Speaker 4:  67 million users when Facebook

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,760
Speaker 4:  only had a third of that.

108
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,640
Speaker 8:  Now Facebook, well, it was created by a guy from Harvard people,

109
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,280
Speaker 8:  praise it for its clean looks and controlled feel. But at the same time,

110
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,640
Speaker 8:  it's a little stuffy. Dare I say geeky.

111
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,840
Speaker 4:  In 2008, the company pushed to make MySpace a one stop

112
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,440
Speaker 4:  destination for music listening to make it more like the celestial

113
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,360
Speaker 4:  jukebox that was promised Holt was tapped to lead the music division

114
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,160
Speaker 4:  and bring established catalogs from Sony Warner and universal onto

115
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,880
Speaker 4:  the site. There was just one problem. Well, my space was

116
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,760
Speaker 4:  great for bonding over bands and building fandoms. It wasn't

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,640
Speaker 4:  actually that good for everyday listening.

118
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,800
Speaker 6:  Some of the features became bugs. The idea that I could

119
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,560
Speaker 6:  self-express and I could make this cool player and I could promote my

120
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,200
Speaker 6:  music again. I could celebrate my fans was great, but then to

121
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,120
Speaker 6:  actually make a playlist at a point in time, when we were starting to move

122
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
Speaker 6:  towards mobile, my space, wasn't ready for that in discovery,

123
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,880
Speaker 6:  lean forward, click play consume, interact. My

124
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,560
Speaker 6:  space was great at that lean back. I just want the music I

125
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,840
Speaker 6:  want, I want to take it with me. I want to have a playlist. It became a lot

126
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,680
Speaker 6:  harder for that to be the case. So you sort of look at the lack of

127
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,600
Speaker 6:  investment and innovation that Newsco wanted to put into it at

128
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,000
Speaker 6:  the time that there was an evolutionary shift in how music was being

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,920
Speaker 6:  consumed. So they had this really incredible magic engine, but it wasn't

130
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,480
Speaker 6:  adaptable for all of the evolutions that were gonna happen in music,

131
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,560
Speaker 6:  discovery and demand.

132
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,600
Speaker 4:  We're gonna take a quick break. When we get back, how we got from

133
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,200
Speaker 4:  my space to TikTok and saw the rise of the artist slash

134
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,680
Speaker 4:  influencer

135
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,170
Speaker 2:  Fox creative.

136
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,410
Speaker 9:  This is advertiser content brought to you by amp.

137
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,330
Speaker 10:  I was just singing all the time and everybody was like, you're gonna

138
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,410
Speaker 10:  be a pop star. And I was like, you know what? Yeah, I am gonna be a ball

139
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,050
Speaker 10:  star. My name is Jay Stevens. I am a singer

140
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,890
Speaker 10:  songwriter, producer, all of that from Los

141
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,850
Speaker 10:  Angeles, California. My parents said that I was singing before I could

142
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,250
Speaker 10:  talk my very own Chris Jenner. My mom, you know, she would always give me

143
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,890
Speaker 10:  songs to sing. And they were either gospel songs or like really old

144
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,850
Speaker 10:  ass R and B. My heart is breaking, blah, blah, blah.

145
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,730
Speaker 10:  I was like, look, I'm tired of this. I wanna write my own songs.

146
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,130
Speaker 9:  Jay wanted to create something fresh, something inspired by the artists

147
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,610
Speaker 9:  and songs. She loved most.

148
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,890
Speaker 10:  You got your Beyonces, you got your brandies, you got your Mariahs

149
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,050
Speaker 10:  that's Bible. Like you need it they're fundamentals. But then there was

150
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,090
Speaker 10:  my rebellious years where I was like, I wanna be edgy. I wanna be dark.

151
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,290
Speaker 9:  Those influences transformed. Jay's voice into something, uniquely her

152
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,970
Speaker 9:  on her. Self-produced single. Hi, my name is,

153
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,850
Speaker 10:  I wrote it in London at 3:00 AM and I

154
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,090
Speaker 10:  was high and I was in love. And that was what I wanted the song to feel

155
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,090
Speaker 10:  like

156
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,530
Speaker 2:  My name is

157
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:28,930

161
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,580
Speaker 4:  As MySpace attempted to build out its music platform, it was

162
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,380
Speaker 4:  declining on the social side by 2011, it had less than

163
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,500
Speaker 4:  one 10th of the number of users of Facebook, which was pretty agnostic

164
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,020
Speaker 4:  to music sharing that same year, Swedish music,

165
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,540
Speaker 4:  streamer, Spotify launched in the us. And unlike MySpace,

166
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,460
Speaker 4:  it was very good at the lean back experience,

167
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,060
Speaker 2:  Whatever you want

168
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,820
Speaker 11:  Whenever you wanted,

169
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,460
Speaker 4:  It gave you exactly the music that you wanted with little to no

170
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,340
Speaker 4:  interference at a price. Once unimaginable 10 bucks

171
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,060
Speaker 4:  a month in Spotify, the celestial jukebox was realized

172
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,660
Speaker 4:  and pushed companies like apple and Amazon to build similar subscription

173
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,420
Speaker 4:  services. But all that scale has made it harder for new artists

174
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,180
Speaker 4:  to break through Larry Miller, who leads the music business

175
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,580
Speaker 4:  program at NYU and has his own podcast

176
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,540
Speaker 4:  Musonomics explains what experts have witnessed.

177
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,980
Speaker 12:  One thing that we've observed is that the magnitude of

178
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,940
Speaker 12:  most hits is smaller. We've also noticed

179
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,800
Speaker 12:  that the amount of music that is uploaded

180
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,200
Speaker 12:  to all of the major streaming services every day

181
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,360
Speaker 12:  has increased. And the vast majority of them don't

182
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,160
Speaker 12:  ever get listened to more than once or twice, including by the

183
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,080
Speaker 12:  uploaders mom and dad or grandparents they're just never, ever, ever

184
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,920
Speaker 12:  listened to.

185
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,240
Speaker 4:  So for an aspiring musician, there are a few ways to break through the noise.

186
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,560
Speaker 4:  You land on a great Spotify playlist, or you ride the algorithms

187
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,400
Speaker 4:  onto a streamer's radio station, but the golden ticket is going viral

188
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,240
Speaker 4:  on TikTok, which happens constantly. Last year,

189
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,560
Speaker 4:  Nigerian artist CK became a global phenomenon when his single

190
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,360
Speaker 4:  loved one TD, which had been released a year prior blew

191
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,000
Speaker 4:  up on the app.

192
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,760
Speaker 4:  It has since been certified platinum in August,

193
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,640
Speaker 4:  Scottish singer songwriter, Katie Gregson, MLO posted a

194
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,520
Speaker 4:  minute long clip of her song complex, which got

195
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,480
Speaker 4:  7.4 million views and landed her contract with

196
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,920
Speaker 4:  Columbia records.

197
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,080
Speaker 13:  If I need like one, he, on

198
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,000
Speaker 13:  the last line, I cry in his

199
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,600
Speaker 12:  Bathroom. The streaming services, including TikTok are

200
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,400
Speaker 12:  amazing at breaking a track. They're less

201
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,360
Speaker 12:  great at breaking an artist and building a career. And that

202
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,320
Speaker 12:  is what record companies are still really, really good at. Just ask

203
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,960
Speaker 12:  little NAS X, just ask Olivia Rodrigo. And so

204
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,880
Speaker 12:  on the one hand, the opportunity, the potential that still

205
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,960
Speaker 12:  exists in these services and the open distribution policies

206
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,800
Speaker 12:  that they have and the platforms that they utilize are fabulous

207
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,800
Speaker 12:  and have dramatically furthered this theme

208
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,680
Speaker 12:  of the democratization of music, discovery and

209
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,000
Speaker 12:  consumption. That's now, you know, more than a generation

210
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,120
Speaker 12:  along, you know, there's a big difference between having a

211
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,760
Speaker 12:  moment and having a sustainable career or actually being

212
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,440
Speaker 12:  the biggest artist in the world

213
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,120
Speaker 4:  For Erica Leman, a singer songwriter based in Rochester, New York,

214
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,240
Speaker 4:  who goes by boy junior social has definitely opened doors.

215
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,800
Speaker 14:  I think most of the things that have come my way have just been, because

216
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Speaker 14:  I'm like putting myself out there and just like having my weird little ideas

217
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,880
Speaker 14:  and being a weirdo online with

218
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,040
Speaker 4:  Spoofs of indie rock culture and remixes of beloved songs, like a

219
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,880
Speaker 4:  hyper pop version of Mr. Brightside,

220
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,400
Speaker 4:  she has over 300,000 followers on TikTok. That's helped

221
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,200
Speaker 4:  drive ticket sales to her live shows and garner over 2

222
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Speaker 4:  million streams on

223
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,800
Speaker 4:  Spotify. She's gotten sponsorship deals with companies like fender and extra

224
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,240
Speaker 4:  debit cards.

225
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,840
Speaker 14:  And there were people who were like, yeah, I saw you in an ad. So I discovered

226
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,160
Speaker 14:  your music that way. And now I'm here at your show. And I was like, wow,

227
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,440
Speaker 4:  Loveman's not a star yet, but she's making a living as an indie artist,

228
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,280
Speaker 4:  which may not have been possible without the exposure she gets through social

229
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,720
Speaker 4:  and streaming. But she's also realistic about how fickle the

230
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,680
Speaker 4:  algorithms can be.

231
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,520
Speaker 14:  Sometimes it has a lot of benefits for artists who are not working

232
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,360
Speaker 14:  with a team with a budget for really significant marketing. It can be

233
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,440
Speaker 14:  a great stroke of luck, but it is so easy to become kind

234
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,240
Speaker 14:  of addicted to that kind of luck and the way that people come in

235
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,040
Speaker 14:  with their comments and the way that it's treated when a video gets viral

236
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,800
Speaker 14:  and that people are instantly like, oh my God, how are you not famous?

237
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,360
Speaker 14:  Someone get this person a record deal immediately. You know, you need to

238
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,200
Speaker 14:  be on TV shows, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, oh, I appreciate those comments

239
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,040
Speaker 14:  a ton, but there's a really good chance. You won't see another video from

240
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,800
Speaker 14:  me for months because your TikTok algorithm is gonna just show you

241
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,680
Speaker 14:  other things. And you're gonna forget about me,

242
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,840
Speaker 4:  The pressure to perform on TikTok bleeds into the songwriting itself.

243
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,320
Speaker 4:  Certain types of lyrics are more likely to go viral than others

244
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,920
Speaker 4:  and artists are keenly aware of that.

245
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:55,160
Speaker 14:  I think it's very easy to become jaded about that concept as like, oh,

246
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,000
Speaker 14:  if you wanna make something that does numbers, you have to like sell out

247
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,600
Speaker 14:  and just like make songs where you list different

248
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,480
Speaker 14:  personality traits or characteristics so that people will make talks where

249
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,960
Speaker 14:  they put green arrows or red. X's next to it. There are certain

250
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,720
Speaker 14:  things I'm writing now that I know are not gonna

251
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,680
Speaker 14:  be really like talkable. And like that has to be

252
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,320
Speaker 14:  okay. Otherwise I would lose my marbles as an artist.

253
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,640
Speaker 4:  The kind of work Erica puts into her content. In addition to her

254
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,400
Speaker 4:  songwriting is standard. Now it's not enough to just make the music

255
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,840
Speaker 4:  anymore.

256
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,400
Speaker 6:  I think you need to be a multihyphenate in today's ecosystem. Do that because

257
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,840
Speaker 6:  you're competing with people who are multihyphenate and multis skew. And

258
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,760
Speaker 6:  if that's the reality of what it takes to be an artist today, yes, there'll

259
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,960
Speaker 6:  always be those artists that are evergreen artists that can break through

260
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,280
Speaker 6:  because they already built that before this whole world has changed.

261
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,120
Speaker 6:  You have artists that are gonna come up that might have a moment of morality

262
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,280
Speaker 6:  where a song breaks through a video breaks through it's a

263
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,840
Speaker 6:  meme. It's something that cuts through, but then it's the capacity that you

264
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,360
Speaker 6:  have to take that advantage of that to take that and turn it into something

265
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,600
Speaker 6:  else.

266
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:11,240
Speaker 4:  So for an aspiring artist, what is more daunting impressing

267
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,080
Speaker 4:  the gatekeepers of old label executives influenced by their own

268
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,360
Speaker 4:  whims and prejudices or the bottomless unfeeling

269
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,280
Speaker 4:  algorithms of the celestial jukebox, which can make you a sensation

270
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,160
Speaker 4:  for one day, just to forget you the next. I'm not sure

271
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,120
Speaker 4:  I have the answer to that, but even if I have trouble making sense of

272
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,960
Speaker 4:  the kind of stardom that emerges from this new landscape, these hybrid

273
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,840
Speaker 4:  influencer artists, there is some 19 year old out there who

274
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,520
Speaker 4:  will look back as fondly on the TikTok era of music. As I do the

275
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,040
Speaker 4:  MySpace era, less fleet foxes, more boy junior.

276
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,400
Speaker 4:  This episode was produced by Liam, James, Andrew Marino

277
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,280
Speaker 4:  and me Ariel Shapiro Nori Donovan is our executive

278
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,720
Speaker 4:  producer and Brook mins is our editorial director of audio.

279
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,400
Speaker 4:  The Vergecast is a verge production and part of the Vox media podcast

280
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,080
Speaker 4:  network. We'll be back with another episode of the future of music.

281
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,720
Speaker 4:  Next Monday
