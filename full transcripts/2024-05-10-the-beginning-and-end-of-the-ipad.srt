00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:12,195
Speaker 2:  Hello And Welcome to Vergecast, the flagship podcast of manufacturing in

3
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:15,715
Speaker 2:  southeastern Wisconsin. We're gonna go deep today on

4
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:19,955
Speaker 2:  concrete, on blue collar jobs, bringing America

5
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:23,275
Speaker 2:  back from wherever it was. And then

6
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:24,955
Speaker 5:  We, then we get a big globe,

7
00:01:24,955 --> 00:01:28,915
Speaker 2:  Right? Huge tiny dome. Yeah. A dome. Excuse me, it's a dome.

8
00:01:29,985 --> 00:01:33,715
Speaker 2:  What I'm talking about of course is Foxconn. In my hometown of Racine, Wisconsin,

9
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:37,795
Speaker 2:  the the literal place where I grew up, we're gonna get to

10
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:41,315
Speaker 2:  it. It's really just a victory lap for me personally

11
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:45,715
Speaker 2:  because Fox on has not done anything else. Like actually, quite notably the

12
00:01:45,715 --> 00:01:49,555
Speaker 2:  news is that someone else has done stuff on that site in Wisconsin.

13
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:50,195
Speaker 2:  Neela.

14
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:53,835
Speaker 6:  Do you think you're the most famous resident of Racine, Wisconsin at this

15
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:54,275
Speaker 6:  moment in

16
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:58,115
Speaker 2:  Time? No. The most famous people from Racine, Wisconsin is the, the

17
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:02,035
Speaker 2:  bad team in the movie. A League of Their Own. Oh, that's good.

18
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,195
Speaker 6:  That's really good.

19
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:07,035
Speaker 2:  Easily the most famous Racine. Yeah.

20
00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:07,835
Speaker 6:  You're never top in that

21
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:12,075
Speaker 2:  Thing. Is that what's her name? Yeah.

22
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:13,275
Speaker 2:  Is it Lori Petty? Yeah,

23
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:14,115
Speaker 5:  Lori Petty. She goes

24
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:16,395
Speaker 2:  To the other team. I don't remember her character's name. I just know it's

25
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:20,235
Speaker 2:  Laura's Lori Petty. Yeah, she has to go. She goes to the Racine

26
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:23,715
Speaker 2:  Bells and then has to pitch against her sister Gina Davis. That's correct.

27
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:27,235
Speaker 2:  And Jeff Bridges is already dead and the bus can't go slower than 55 miles

28
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:27,555
Speaker 2:  an hour.

29
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:33,235
Speaker 2:  That's not in the movie at all. That's a straight, they're all the same straight.

30
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:35,955
Speaker 2:  That is a straight reference to Dress To Kill by Eddie Izard and If. you

31
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,955
Speaker 2:  get it. I love you and you are my people and you can just send me a note

32
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:41,915
Speaker 2:  and I'll send you a T-shirt. But you have to be able to tell me exactly what

33
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:45,515
Speaker 2:  it's okay. That's that whole thing. The other most famous president received

34
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:49,195
Speaker 2:  in Wisconsin is of course Sam Johnson of Johnson's Wax fame,

35
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:53,715
Speaker 2:  who did some weird stuff in a plane over Central America and built a

36
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,675
Speaker 2:  wax fortune that started the high school I went to Whose PBX system was

37
00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:01,365
Speaker 2:  connected to the SC Johnson company. So you could pick up any phone in the

38
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:04,405
Speaker 2:  school and dial four digits and get a j, a vp.

39
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:07,405
Speaker 2:  I don't know if, I don't know why I know that information.

40
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,445
Speaker 5:  That was a deep Racine lawyer. Wow. Just

41
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:14,045
Speaker 6:  Was that who you would prank call in?

42
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:16,245
Speaker 2:  I got kicked outta that high school lot.

43
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:17,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that right.

44
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:20,405
Speaker 2:  Just flatly kicked outta that school. Anyway, that's coming later in the

45
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:23,565
Speaker 2:  show. Not the Johnson wax stuff. The fox fun stuff.

46
00:03:23,785 --> 00:03:25,165
Speaker 6:  That's much later in the show.

47
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:29,165
Speaker 2:  There is iPad News, like a lot of iPad news to talk to, but in a small

48
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:33,165
Speaker 2:  way we'll get to it. Kranz. The streaming

49
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:37,645
Speaker 2:  movie industry. The television industry in a moment. I of I would say

50
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:38,125
Speaker 2:  turmoil.

51
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:41,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah, they, they, they realize they have to make money.

52
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,605
Speaker 2:  That's a problem. So we're gonna talk about that. And then we got a lightning

53
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:48,365
Speaker 2:  round, just shock waves in the lightning round,

54
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:51,805
Speaker 2:  which is unsponsored again this week. So if between now

55
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:55,725
Speaker 2:  and the lightning round, if you've got money to spend,

56
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:59,485
Speaker 6:  We have gotten some interest though. I will say If, you If, you want to throw

57
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:03,325
Speaker 6:  money at us? Let's start a bidding war because it's coming.

58
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:07,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And we'll do it live on the air. That'll be the lightning round. Love

59
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:10,805
Speaker 2:  it. Recursive lightning round. Sponsored by the people. Wait

60
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:13,005
Speaker 5:  Dude, does that mean we get to do the bidding voice? The,

61
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:18,205
Speaker 2:  You know, you can go to classes for those. I saw a TikTok. Anyway. None of

62
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:18,805
Speaker 2:  that is important

63
00:04:21,145 --> 00:04:23,285
Speaker 2:  by the way. I'm your friend Neil Alex. Cranz is here.

64
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:25,925
Speaker 5:  I'm your friend who really wants to be one of those guys.

65
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:28,765
Speaker 2:  Auctioneer. The auctioneer for is auctioneer.

66
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:33,485
Speaker 6:  The Bo guy is like don't wanna up 30 foot That's

67
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:34,965
Speaker 2:  That's what he's No, that's a kid rock song.

68
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:37,805
Speaker 2:  David Pierce is

69
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:40,085
Speaker 6:  Here. Hi. Okay. Lovely to be here.

70
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:44,565
Speaker 2:  Alright, so this week the news is that Apple had

71
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:47,845
Speaker 2:  like a warmup event for wwc. I don't even know what else to call it. It felt

72
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:48,565
Speaker 2:  like a warmup

73
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:50,005
Speaker 5:  Cracked their knuckles.

74
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:54,165
Speaker 2:  They're like, here's some stuff, we gotta get this stuff outta the way. They

75
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:58,165
Speaker 2:  ran a 35 minute infomercial for new iPads at this point. Apple

76
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:02,125
Speaker 2:  loves the infomercial event, but they had some watch parties. David went

77
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,165
Speaker 2:  to one in New York. You got to sit down, watch the infomercial,

78
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:10,085
Speaker 2:  spend some time with the new hardware. But all of it, even

79
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:13,445
Speaker 2:  at the end of the event, I just want to, I feel like it's important to

80
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:17,165
Speaker 2:  contextualize this event by noting that at the end of the iPad

81
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:21,085
Speaker 2:  infomercial, Tim Cook came back on the screen and said, we

82
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:24,325
Speaker 2:  will have much more to say about the future of our platforms at WW DC

83
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:29,965
Speaker 2:  because the thing that needs to change on the iPad is iPad os.

84
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:33,525
Speaker 2:  And they announced no changes to iPad OS at this event.

85
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:34,365
Speaker 5:  Nope.

86
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:38,565
Speaker 2:  So it just, it just felt like, here's part one of the story.

87
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:41,885
Speaker 5:  You watched follow for part two.

88
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:44,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. You watched all of Mission Impossible, dead Reckoning.

89
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:49,405
Speaker 2:  Can't wait till next year. Like that's basically how that felt.

90
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:52,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it was odd, I think and, and I went in

91
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,805
Speaker 6:  thinking there must be something and we got to be fair little teeny tiny

92
00:05:56,835 --> 00:06:00,485
Speaker 6:  bits of software, right? There was new final cut and new logic. There's a

93
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,925
Speaker 6:  new app called Final Cut Camera that works. So there's like tiny

94
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:07,485
Speaker 6:  bits of things that you can do, but the, the overwhelming question for the

95
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:11,445
Speaker 6:  iPad for like damn near a decade at this point has been, what am I supposed

96
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:15,325
Speaker 6:  to do with all of this power in this thing? Yeah. And we did

97
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:19,165
Speaker 6:  not get a lot of, I would say, new compelling answers to those questions.

98
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:23,245
Speaker 2:  I would say, in fact, we got none. And I want, I wanna come to that because,

99
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:26,525
Speaker 2:  you know, we have to review these things and I think there's like a, there's

100
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:29,125
Speaker 2:  a question mark at the end of this review. And the question mark is like,

101
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,885
Speaker 2:  what if they add a bunch of AI features in June? Right? Like, who knows?

102
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:35,845
Speaker 2:  But's actually talk about what they announced. They basically refresh the

103
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:39,485
Speaker 2:  entire lineup. Save the mini. It's actually very funny. If, you go to

104
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:42,845
Speaker 2:  apple.com right now and click on iPad. All of the iPads have the word new

105
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:45,925
Speaker 2:  under them and it feels like the, the mini should have the word old under

106
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:46,125
Speaker 2:  it.

107
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:49,205
Speaker 2:  They're just like the mini

108
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:53,085
Speaker 6:  Did at least get, it was like in the last 20

109
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:56,965
Speaker 6:  words that Tim Cook said in the whole thing. He said the words iPad

110
00:06:56,995 --> 00:07:00,805
Speaker 6:  mini out loud. Which made me happy because that, that at least

111
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:03,765
Speaker 6:  is some acknowledgement that it exists and will continue to exist.

112
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:09,255
Speaker 6:  But it, that was it. That was the entirety of the love for the iPad mini

113
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:11,175
Speaker 6:  at this event. And that made me sad. I loved,

114
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:14,775
Speaker 5:  They just refreshed it last year. I'm trying to remember when I bought mine.

115
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:15,935
Speaker 5:  Was it last

116
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,495
Speaker 2:  Year? It was like two years ago. It

117
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:19,575
Speaker 6:  Was 2022 sometime. Yeah. Yeah. Oh wow.

118
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:22,615
Speaker 2:  Okay. That's, and they make that product entirely as I understand it, for

119
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:25,895
Speaker 2:  pilots to strap to their legs while they fly planes. Yeah. So whatever the

120
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:29,495
Speaker 2:  mini aside deer sweet mini, the base models

121
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:33,375
Speaker 2:  refresh in so much as it a refresh is that they dropped the price,

122
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:36,295
Speaker 2:  the 3 49, which is important 'cause that's probably where it should have

123
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:40,095
Speaker 2:  been. They got rid of the ninth gen, which they were selling for 3 29. That's

124
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:43,735
Speaker 2:  one of the lightning connector and the headphone jack, no iPads. Apple is

125
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:46,335
Speaker 2:  selling right now, have a headphone jack, which I think is nightmares for

126
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:49,535
Speaker 2:  parents. I know I have a lot of dongle apologists in my mentions,

127
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:54,175
Speaker 2:  but If, you have a small child and you are ever traveling with the child

128
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:59,055
Speaker 2:  managing Bluetooth headphones for a child. It's just like no fun. Like,

129
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,055
Speaker 2:  and charging a thing. Like it's just easier to have the analog connector.

130
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:05,935
Speaker 2:  Please don't tell me about your SPC dongles. I don't care man. I don't care

131
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:08,615
Speaker 2:  that you're in the pocket of big dongle, which is not my problem.

132
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:12,815
Speaker 2:  Anyhow, they, that's the big refresh there and I think it's important they

133
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:16,615
Speaker 2:  brought that price down. Then the iPad Air feels

134
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:18,615
Speaker 2:  like a very subtle refresh. David, what'd they do there?

135
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:22,735
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's, it's, I would say subtle refresh is

136
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:26,535
Speaker 6:  basically right. The big change is that now there's a bigger one,

137
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:29,775
Speaker 6:  there's now a 13 inch version of the iPad air.

138
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:34,255
Speaker 6:  It has an M two chip. It comes in a couple of new colors,

139
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:38,415
Speaker 6:  but it is still very much an iPad air, right? Like thi, this

140
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:42,295
Speaker 6:  is I think the iPad that Apple wants most people to

141
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:46,055
Speaker 6:  buy, which is why it has the new colors, it has the,

142
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:50,175
Speaker 6:  the magic keyboard, it has the pencil. It is kind of the sort of

143
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:54,575
Speaker 6:  most mid of all of the iPads. And that is very much

144
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,445
Speaker 6:  what Apple wants it to be. And yeah, it's 5 9 9 for the 11

145
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:02,205
Speaker 6:  inch, 7, 9 9 for the 13 inch. And they're very much doing like a MacBook

146
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:05,885
Speaker 6:  Air MacBook Pro thing with these devices where you have the

147
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:09,925
Speaker 6:  sort of slightly less powerful, cheaper, simpler

148
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:14,125
Speaker 6:  computer into sizes. And then you have the more pro thing with all the advanced

149
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:18,005
Speaker 6:  specs for a lot more money still at the same two sizes. But

150
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:21,885
Speaker 6:  they've landed on this 11 and 13 inch thing as like the way going

151
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:22,165
Speaker 6:  forward.

152
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:22,845
Speaker 5:  But

153
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,845
Speaker 5:  I just don't understand why anyone would buy the air

154
00:09:28,755 --> 00:09:32,565
Speaker 5:  when the regular iPad exists and is got

155
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:36,485
Speaker 5:  like what? It's got the same or it's got an A 14. Okay. The iPad air has

156
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:40,285
Speaker 5:  an M two, does that really matter to 90% of people who are

157
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:41,365
Speaker 5:  using an iPad?

158
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:45,565
Speaker 6:  No. Which is, back to what you were saying Neli a minute ago,

159
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:49,285
Speaker 6:  a Apple would like you to believe that it matters and Apple would love to

160
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:53,205
Speaker 6:  tell you stories about all the power of its new chips

161
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:55,765
Speaker 6:  and why this stuff matters. And we're gonna get to the pro in a minute, which

162
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:59,405
Speaker 6:  has an even newer chip and I spent a lot of time with Apple

163
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:02,765
Speaker 6:  executives learning about the, the wonders of the new chip.

164
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:08,485
Speaker 6:  If you're just like a person who does normal iPad things in the world, I

165
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:12,925
Speaker 6:  cannot in good conscience tell you a processor upgrade in

166
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:16,125
Speaker 6:  your iPad is worth it. Yeah. And so I think that is the question. It's like,

167
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:19,725
Speaker 6:  I think Apple would very much like you to buy

168
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:24,205
Speaker 6:  the air, and I think Apple thinks the air is the

169
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:28,125
Speaker 6:  correct one for the largest number of people, but it

170
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:31,085
Speaker 6:  still feels a little like tweener ish to me

171
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:32,745
Speaker 6:  for a lot of things.

172
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:37,065
Speaker 5:  I found some differences between the air and the 10th gen iPad.

173
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:37,745
Speaker 6:  Okay.

174
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:41,465
Speaker 5:  The hover function on the new Apple pencil will work on the air.

175
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:44,425
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's a bunch of pencil stuff. Yeah.

176
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:44,785
Speaker 5:  It's like

177
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,385
Speaker 2:  The, the original, the 10th gen iPad is

178
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:49,305
Speaker 2:  A-U-S-B-C

179
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:54,785
Speaker 2:  Dous pencil. Yeah. And it has the other smart keyboard or the magic

180
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:57,185
Speaker 2:  keyboard and that's it.

181
00:10:57,605 --> 00:10:59,625
Speaker 5:  And it a hundred knits brighter

182
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:00,785
Speaker 2:  Sure.

183
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:03,425
Speaker 5:  P three instead of SRGB.

184
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:05,305
Speaker 2:  Hey, that, that matters to me. Yeah.

185
00:11:05,305 --> 00:11:07,945
Speaker 5:  That, that does like that. And the fact that it has anti-reflective coating,

186
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,385
Speaker 5:  those two things do actually matter.

187
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:12,825
Speaker 2:  But it's a slightly nicer product that uses slightly newer accessories.

188
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,745
Speaker 6:  But again, by the time you're down this road of any of this stuff, you're

189
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:17,465
Speaker 6:  way beyond

190
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:22,615
Speaker 6:  the the average. I just need an iPad to look at while I sit on the couch

191
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:26,455
Speaker 6:  user. Right. Like to me it's like if you're even thinking about buying a

192
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:30,415
Speaker 6:  magic keyboard, buy the air or higher period. Yep. Right. Like that's, it's,

193
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:33,695
Speaker 6:  I think that's fairly simple. I think a lot of people who want iPads don't

194
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:37,575
Speaker 6:  want anything other than the pane of glass to hold in their hands.

195
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:42,055
Speaker 6:  And for most of those people, I can't think of a single reason the air

196
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:46,015
Speaker 6:  is going to be like meaningfully better for you in your life than the regular

197
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:46,535
Speaker 6:  iPad.

198
00:11:46,725 --> 00:11:50,695
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I think this points to just the problem, which is what

199
00:11:50,755 --> 00:11:54,485
Speaker 2:  is the use case for the iPad? And now again, the hardware

200
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:58,365
Speaker 2:  suggests that it is an expansive list of use

201
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:01,285
Speaker 2:  cases and to some extent it is. Right? Like

202
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:06,005
Speaker 2:  some people, I am sure produce music in Logic

203
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:09,965
Speaker 2:  exclusively in an iPad. Those people are causing themselves

204
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:13,205
Speaker 2:  an enormous amount of pain, but they're choosing to do it. And that is they're

205
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:17,085
Speaker 2:  right as Americans. Sure. Fine. Right. It's just here at

206
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:20,925
Speaker 2:  the, at the bottom of the range, the step from the 10th

207
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:24,965
Speaker 2:  gen to the air is very small hardware wise. Right. It is a nicer piece of

208
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:28,645
Speaker 2:  hardware. It's a bigger screen you can get now an even bigger screen, but

209
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:32,405
Speaker 2:  it's a very mild refresh. And basically they, they have added the

210
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:36,205
Speaker 2:  13 inch size fine. Yeah. But the

211
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:40,205
Speaker 2:  capabilities of the product are exactly the same as they were yesterday or

212
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:43,365
Speaker 2:  the day before. Yep. It's where you, it's the iPad Pro

213
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:48,125
Speaker 2:  and now the Pencil Pro where like, now

214
00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:52,285
Speaker 2:  this, the purpose of this event it felt like was to simplify

215
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:56,365
Speaker 2:  this increasingly complicated lineup. And you get to the iPad Pro

216
00:12:56,785 --> 00:13:00,085
Speaker 2:  and the Pencil Pro and the fact that Apple now sells I think four different

217
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:03,165
Speaker 2:  pencils and you're just like, what is going on here?

218
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:07,445
Speaker 5:  The pencils are really bad. Yeah. Like, like the, the, the chart

219
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,725
Speaker 5:  of which pencil works with which product and has which feature. Like no

220
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:15,685
Speaker 5:  If, you have a chart that big for a Apple product. You've, you've

221
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:16,365
Speaker 5:  messed up. Yeah.

222
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,845
Speaker 2:  Let's get into the, well there's that. Yeah. Let's, let's talk about the

223
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:21,645
Speaker 2:  philosophy of the iPad in a second. Sorry. The iPad Pro is a piece of hardware

224
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:25,365
Speaker 2:  appears be very impressive. David, you've seen it. Tell us about it.

225
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:28,365
Speaker 6:  It's so, so good. I

226
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:32,645
Speaker 6:  we we go to a lot of these events, right? And you're like, you're constantly

227
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,525
Speaker 6:  being handed a thing that somebody has just spent a half hour telling you

228
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:39,285
Speaker 6:  is new and most of the time you're just like, this is, this is a

229
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:43,285
Speaker 6:  MacBook like of c It sure is. And and the iPad

230
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:47,085
Speaker 6:  is like the canonical example of that, right? Like for years and years

231
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:49,845
Speaker 6:  and years, you pick up an iPad and you're like, boy, that sure is an iPad.

232
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:54,365
Speaker 6:  I picked up the iPad Pro at this event in New York and like out loud

233
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:58,205
Speaker 6:  involuntarily just said, holy shit. Ooh. Like it is so

234
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:02,565
Speaker 6:  thin and so light and so small, especially on the 13 inch.

235
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:07,205
Speaker 6:  I I it was, it's the biggest like leap forward

236
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,605
Speaker 6:  in how impressive I find this hardware in a really long time.

237
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,885
Speaker 6:  Again, we can debate forever the value of any of this hardware, but just

238
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:18,765
Speaker 6:  the sheer like engineering feet to get this thing under a pound,

239
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:23,125
Speaker 6:  it's 5.1 millimeters thick. by the

240
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,565
Speaker 6:  way everybody says 5.1 millimeters thin now. And I think we've complained

241
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:30,245
Speaker 6:  about that. Yeah. That's nothing. Things are not, You can't measure

242
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:33,685
Speaker 6:  the thinness of something. Yeah. It's thickness and there's not much of it.

243
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:33,965
Speaker 6:  Which is

244
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:36,925
Speaker 2:  Steve, Steve, Steve Jobs started doing this with the, I believe the second

245
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:38,205
Speaker 2:  generation MacBook Air.

246
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:42,085
Speaker 6:  I hate it so much and everybody does this now and it drives me insane. But

247
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:43,005
Speaker 6:  that's neither here nor there.

248
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:45,605
Speaker 5:  It's 5.1 millimeters, but that's the 13

249
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:49,125
Speaker 6:  Inch. Yeah. And I, and the 11 inch I believe is is either is five three.

250
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:53,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Okay. But the point is the, they're, they're spectacular.

251
00:14:53,315 --> 00:14:56,485
Speaker 6:  Like truly as pieces of hardware, they are incredibly impressive to the point

252
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:59,965
Speaker 6:  where you're holding the thing. And like everybody who's made this joke,

253
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:03,845
Speaker 6:  Marquez Brownley, when he made a video, had the jerry rig everything guy

254
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:07,765
Speaker 6:  just sort of peek out from the corner of the video. Like it feels like you

255
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:11,685
Speaker 6:  could snap this thing in half. Whether or not you can, I don't know,

256
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:15,445
Speaker 6:  If you can, that feels like a problem. But yeah, just the, the sheer

257
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:18,605
Speaker 6:  machinery inside of this thing is really, really, really impressive.

258
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:22,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And there's two pieces I think that are important to call out. One

259
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:26,005
Speaker 2:  is new processor, the M four, which is interesting just sort of

260
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,805
Speaker 2:  from a processor technology standpoint. Apple

261
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:33,845
Speaker 2:  didn't put an M three in this If, you read Ben Thompson's

262
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:37,845
Speaker 2:  eckery, he points out that the M three is on

263
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:41,725
Speaker 2:  a three nanometer process node from tsmc. That was a technology dead

264
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:45,525
Speaker 2:  end. Yeah. And TSMC has all but admitted it and the M

265
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:49,405
Speaker 2:  four is on the one that is sustainable and has a future. So

266
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:53,205
Speaker 2:  at TSMC was like, we made this weird dead end because we have customers who

267
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:57,045
Speaker 2:  insist on being at the, at the leading edge, there's one customer that

268
00:15:57,045 --> 00:16:00,485
Speaker 2:  insists on being at the leading edge. So they made, so the M three could

269
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:04,045
Speaker 2:  be in whatever computers it was in. And the M four is the, the leap

270
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:08,085
Speaker 2:  to the good version of the three nanometer node that has like a roadmap in

271
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:11,605
Speaker 2:  front of it. So you see Apple is trying, they're putting

272
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:16,165
Speaker 2:  the stuff like the best stuff they got into this machine. And then

273
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:20,325
Speaker 2:  on top of that it has the tandem ed people have been talking about stacked

274
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:24,205
Speaker 2:  ole displaced for a very long time. It's a really simple

275
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:28,205
Speaker 2:  idea. Like, it's like deceptively simple. Obviously it's taking a long time

276
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:32,045
Speaker 2:  to pull off, but If, you run an OLED at the brightness, you wanna

277
00:16:32,045 --> 00:16:35,885
Speaker 2:  run an oled, it gets hot, you risk burning. So why don't we just

278
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:39,765
Speaker 2:  take two ED displays basically combine their power source

279
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:43,565
Speaker 2:  and then we just run them each at half brightness on top of each other to

280
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,965
Speaker 2:  get sort like real p my ride, like linking there.

281
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:50,685
Speaker 2:  It's very clever. And then what you can do, and David, I'm very curious this

282
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:54,525
Speaker 2:  'cause I haven't seen it. I know you have If, you run 'em both at top

283
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:58,485
Speaker 2:  brightness, you get a much brighter OLA display, which is that I

284
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,885
Speaker 2:  think is the promise and the thing that people have been trying to work on

285
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:01,365
Speaker 2:  for a long time.

286
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:05,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It was tough to tell. I mean these, these Apple events are always lit

287
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:08,725
Speaker 6:  really bizarrely in such a way that it's really hard to sort of get in the

288
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:13,245
Speaker 6:  nitty gritty pixels of a display. But it, it was noticeably brighter.

289
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:17,205
Speaker 6:  Like I brought my 11 inch pro from last generation

290
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:20,525
Speaker 6:  with me and like just holding the two things side by side. You can, you can

291
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:24,405
Speaker 6:  tell how much brighter the ole is. I think they said it's 1600 knits at

292
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:28,245
Speaker 6:  full brightness, which is a lot. I assume we'll just shred your battery to

293
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:31,845
Speaker 6:  bits at full brightness. 'cause like you're running that

294
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:36,165
Speaker 6:  many ole pixels at full brightness. Like you're like, I'm gonna watch one

295
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:39,165
Speaker 6:  episode of something and it's just gonna shatter the battery. Well

296
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:43,005
Speaker 2:  No, but this is the, this is the idea though is that you're, you get more

297
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:46,205
Speaker 2:  efficiency maybe at the top brightness where you're running effectively both

298
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:49,765
Speaker 2:  panels all the way. But the idea is that sort of at your everyday

299
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:53,325
Speaker 2:  brightness, right? You're running both panels like

300
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:53,805
Speaker 2:  halfway.

301
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:58,405
Speaker 6:  Right? And that's also a big part of the reason that the

302
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:02,125
Speaker 6:  M four and the tandem mo that are happening simultaneously. Like the the

303
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,525
Speaker 6:  overwhelming thing I heard talking to folks at this event was that like we

304
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:08,445
Speaker 6:  couldn't do one of these without the other. That that, that

305
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:12,325
Speaker 6:  driving those two displays at that high resolution

306
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:16,245
Speaker 6:  and that high refresh rate is, is just a massive amount of

307
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:19,885
Speaker 6:  computational work. And doing those two things, especially in a way that

308
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:23,765
Speaker 6:  is like at all power efficient is just really hard. And that a lot

309
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:27,045
Speaker 6:  of what the M four is is explicitly about

310
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:31,165
Speaker 6:  driving the tandem ole, which I think is really interesting. And I wonder

311
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:35,125
Speaker 6:  what that says about like the next set of products that might have m

312
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:35,765
Speaker 6:  fours inside.

313
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,365
Speaker 2:  What kind of MacBook do you make if you've got a big tandem OLED driver

314
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:42,045
Speaker 2:  Exactly. Sitting on your chip, right? The big ass battery.

315
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,445
Speaker 6:  Exactly.

316
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:46,685
Speaker 2:  It is just gonna be one of those like a hundred milliamp hour Oh yeah. Anchor

317
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:49,805
Speaker 2:  batteries with this, this screen that falls on it. I would take that product

318
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:52,805
Speaker 2:  if they made this twice as thick and got rid of the camera bump and was like,

319
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:55,885
Speaker 2:  the battery lasts for a week, I would be happy. Yeah,

320
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:58,885
Speaker 6:  I I do agree with that. I mean, there was a very funny thing where, you know,

321
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:02,525
Speaker 6:  you, you hold this thing and it's, it's a remarkable piece of technology.

322
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:05,325
Speaker 6:  Like they built the hell outta the hardware, but then I'm like, okay, if

323
00:19:05,355 --> 00:19:09,005
Speaker 6:  this thing was a little thicker so that it didn't have a camera bump, which

324
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:11,965
Speaker 6:  is the thing a lot of people pointed out was this, this could have been

325
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,325
Speaker 6:  the, the thickness of the camera bump and would've been about the same thickness

326
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:19,325
Speaker 6:  as the last iPad, which no one was complaining about the thickness of, by

327
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:23,005
Speaker 6:  the way. Yeah. And you'd get more battery, you might get

328
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,485
Speaker 6:  more power efficiency out of it. You'd get better speakers just because there's

329
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:30,005
Speaker 6:  room to move the audio around that like maybe this

330
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:34,725
Speaker 6:  constant thrust toward thinness that Apple has been on for so long is

331
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:38,845
Speaker 6:  actually not the right strategy. Yeah. And I largely agree with that, but

332
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:42,245
Speaker 6:  like, god damn, is it cool just to hold the thing when it's that thin,

333
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:46,245
Speaker 2:  This thing you are a Johnny Ipil, this thing is like Ives revenge. It kind

334
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:49,205
Speaker 2:  of, he's like, here's what happens. You pick up an iPhone six and it flops

335
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:51,045
Speaker 2:  over, but damn is it thin? Yeah.

336
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:51,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

337
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:55,485
Speaker 2:  Pretty much fine. Yeah. And then there's a new

338
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:59,005
Speaker 2:  accessories, right? So there's the Apple Pencil Pro, which

339
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:02,565
Speaker 2:  adds the ability to do a barrel roll. Do a barrel roll.

340
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:07,125
Speaker 2:  You can also squeeze it. Love to, love to squeeze a pencil. When I think

341
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,285
Speaker 2:  about totally natural user interfaces, it's squeezing a pen. Yeah.

342
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:11,565
Speaker 2:  Wait, can

343
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:14,645
Speaker 6:  I just say two things about the pencil? Yeah. One, the squeeze is actually

344
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:17,845
Speaker 6:  pretty nice. They put, they put a real like haptic engine into it. So it

345
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:21,565
Speaker 6:  feels, it feels like a, a MacBook track pad now in the sense that you get

346
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:24,685
Speaker 6:  a little bit of that response. I don't know that it adds

347
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:28,885
Speaker 6:  wildly to the experience of using it, but it does feel nice to squeeze the

348
00:20:28,885 --> 00:20:32,605
Speaker 6:  thing. The other thing is Apple is very excited about the

349
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:36,085
Speaker 6:  developer possibilities for this. There there are going to be APIs that you

350
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:39,285
Speaker 6:  can just give to any app and they're gonna be able to do stuff with the squeeze.

351
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:42,885
Speaker 6:  And I just like casually threw out the example of like, oh, I can't wait

352
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:46,325
Speaker 6:  to use my pencil to change the Spotify song. And somebody just goes, Hmm,

353
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:48,965
Speaker 6:  interesting idea. And I was like, no, that was a joke. That's a bad idea.

354
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:49,765
Speaker 6:  No one should do that.

355
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:55,245
Speaker 6:  So, so there's gonna be some like deeply weird pencil gesture

356
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:59,245
Speaker 6:  support stuff going on and they're, they're gonna be able to chain

357
00:21:00,085 --> 00:21:04,005
Speaker 6:  gestures on the pencil to shortcuts. So all

358
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:07,965
Speaker 6:  the shortcut nerds are really excited about this now. It's gonna get

359
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:09,885
Speaker 6:  really weird and I'm very excited about it.

360
00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:13,885
Speaker 2:  Okay. My prediction is that it does not get weird.

361
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:19,125
Speaker 2:  Like I, I love the idea of adaptive user

362
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,285
Speaker 2:  interfaces and I have like talked about them with a lot of people

363
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:27,125
Speaker 2:  over the years. I actually just, Dylan Field, the CEO of Figma was on stage

364
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:31,005
Speaker 2:  with me at South By, and he's like, I love the idea of adaptive user interfaces.

365
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:34,925
Speaker 2:  And we talked specifically about stylists and pencils and

366
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:38,845
Speaker 2:  like what if, as you were, you know, sketching a design in Figma, the sort

367
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:42,605
Speaker 2:  of UI was around your stylists was adapting

368
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:45,245
Speaker 2:  to what you were doing. So you could just like move seamlessly. Like this

369
00:21:45,245 --> 00:21:48,925
Speaker 2:  is a dream, this is a technologist dream. The idea that

370
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:52,885
Speaker 2:  a bunch of app developers are gonna flock to the broken app

371
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:56,805
Speaker 2:  development model of the iPad and develop custom features for a pencil

372
00:21:57,075 --> 00:21:59,285
Speaker 2:  that is only available at the top end of the range.

373
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:04,765
Speaker 2:  I look David, I'm very, I really want you to squeeze your way through a Spotify

374
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:08,045
Speaker 2:  playlist. I mean, there's nothing I want more for you. You're,

375
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:11,285
Speaker 6:  You're way overstating the amount of work that it's gonna be to, it's like,

376
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:14,325
Speaker 6:  it's like setting up a keyboard shortcut to do this. Like it's not hard work

377
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:16,685
Speaker 2:  To set that my set, my Netflix wouldn't put a video player on the Vision

378
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:17,005
Speaker 2:  Pro.

379
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:22,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean fair. But also, I mean,

380
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:26,605
Speaker 6:  A, you're right. And BI would like everyone to email your favorite

381
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:28,125
Speaker 6:  shortcut to neli at The Verge

382
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:32,005
Speaker 2:  Dot com. I love, I love a shortcut. I love them. Can't get enough

383
00:22:32,065 --> 00:22:36,045
Speaker 2:  of scripting my own applications to defeat the lack of cross

384
00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:40,205
Speaker 2:  app interoperability on Apple's platforms. It's my favorite. Yeah,

385
00:22:40,395 --> 00:22:40,965
Speaker 6:  It's good stuff.

386
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:44,365
Speaker 2:  I just, this is the sort of thing where Apple makes a big promise about everybody's

387
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:48,205
Speaker 2:  supporting a thing and then we wait. Yeah. And so I would just

388
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:50,405
Speaker 2:  challenge you on the scale of,

389
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,925
Speaker 2:  I don't know, dashboard widgets to

390
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:59,525
Speaker 2:  the touch bar. Where do we think pencil squeezing

391
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:00,685
Speaker 2:  support is gonna land

392
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:04,285
Speaker 6:  From like very bad to very bad. Is that, is that where we're at right now?

393
00:23:05,305 --> 00:23:05,525
Speaker 6:  No,

394
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:09,565
Speaker 2:  I think about some big Apple UI idea that it had

395
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:13,085
Speaker 2:  iPhone widgets. Sure. On your lock screen live activities and then Dynamic

396
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:16,605
Speaker 2:  Island support. We've seen just a lot of support for that, especially as

397
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,205
Speaker 2:  it came to the mainstream phone. Very good. Okay. So that's on the, the plus

398
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:22,525
Speaker 2:  side. That's great. And then there's the touch bar

399
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:24,085
Speaker 2:  all the way over there.

400
00:23:24,745 --> 00:23:28,165
Speaker 5:  The touch bar was awesome. Just nobody gave a shit.

401
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:33,405
Speaker 2:  Okay. Excited for you to use Spotify with your touch bar. Okay.

402
00:23:34,065 --> 00:23:37,285
Speaker 2:  I'm just saying that's the range. Yeah. Where do you put squeezing the pencil

403
00:23:37,505 --> 00:23:41,165
Speaker 6:  Closer to the touch bar? I mean, I think it's just true. Like

404
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:45,285
Speaker 6:  it's not, it's not a mainstream accessory. I would actually actually like

405
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:49,285
Speaker 6:  keyboard shortcuts on the iPad are, are actually probably right in line with

406
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:53,125
Speaker 6:  the same thing. Right? It's the kind of thing that are relatively

407
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:57,085
Speaker 6:  cheap to add and relatively straightforward for users to

408
00:23:57,085 --> 00:24:00,085
Speaker 6:  access once they have them. But the attach rate of those accessories is not

409
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:04,005
Speaker 6:  super high. Yep. Most apps don't really need it. Like what

410
00:24:04,005 --> 00:24:07,765
Speaker 6:  you're gonna see is there's going to be this set of like apps that

411
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:11,405
Speaker 6:  use the pencil that are going to use the hell out of the pencil and you're

412
00:24:11,475 --> 00:24:15,285
Speaker 6:  already all of the drawing apps. And like, I've just been talking to folks

413
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:17,525
Speaker 6:  even in the last couple of days, like folks are psyched about the barrel

414
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:21,285
Speaker 6:  roll stuff and just like the little creative abilities that you

415
00:24:21,685 --> 00:24:25,565
Speaker 6:  get just with the additional tiny features in here are like a big deal.

416
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:28,765
Speaker 6:  But they're a big deal for a tiny number of features to a tiny number of

417
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:32,445
Speaker 6:  people and that's great. But I, I don't see a world in which the pencil is

418
00:24:32,635 --> 00:24:36,125
Speaker 6:  ever bigger than that. So I think the idea that like Spotify is gonna care

419
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:39,925
Speaker 6:  about it is not real. If a pencil came free I would feel

420
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:41,285
Speaker 6:  differently, but it doesn't. Yeah.

421
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:44,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I do love the idea that you go to events where people are, are sort

422
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:48,045
Speaker 2:  of professionally obligated to like be kind to you and just have horrible

423
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:49,805
Speaker 2:  ideas and they're like, good idea.

424
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:50,645
Speaker 6:  It's so fun.

425
00:24:51,515 --> 00:24:52,205
Speaker 2:  It's so fun.

426
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:56,645
Speaker 6:  I just pitch stupid products to people for like several hours and it's, and

427
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:58,885
Speaker 6:  they go Ha and then they keep giving me demos. It's

428
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:02,885
Speaker 2:  Great. Sets a pencil. The one I'm really curious about is

429
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:06,725
Speaker 2:  the keyboard because my favorite plane computer of all

430
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:10,645
Speaker 2:  time was a 12 inch MacBook, which was super light and thin. I tried to replace

431
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:14,485
Speaker 2:  it with the previous 11 inch iPad Pro, which just turned out to

432
00:25:14,485 --> 00:25:18,125
Speaker 2:  like thick. It was just like a heavy weird, it just like wasn't

433
00:25:18,465 --> 00:25:22,365
Speaker 2:  as good as a laptop in many ways because of just the way it worked. Is

434
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:25,885
Speaker 2:  the new keyboard case sort of better? It's, they announced it as being more

435
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:27,965
Speaker 2:  like a MacBook than ever, which I thought was really interesting.

436
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:32,405
Speaker 6:  The top half hasn't really changed, which I think is,

437
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:36,205
Speaker 6:  is gonna be its challenge. It's still, at least in the demos I got

438
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:39,405
Speaker 6:  and, and the time I was able to spend with it, it's still a little wobbly,

439
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:43,205
Speaker 6:  especially when you touch it. So it kind of wiggles as you move it around

440
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:47,725
Speaker 6:  the bottom, especially on the pros is aluminum. It's much

441
00:25:47,725 --> 00:25:50,605
Speaker 6:  more solid. It's really smooth. It actually like, feels nice to rest your

442
00:25:50,605 --> 00:25:52,205
Speaker 6:  palm on kind of MacBook Airly

443
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:57,325
Speaker 6:  and the Keys felt amazing. I've spent like 10 minutes on it so I reserved

444
00:25:57,325 --> 00:26:00,205
Speaker 6:  the right to change my mind. But it, it was, it was one of those keyboards,

445
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:03,845
Speaker 6:  you just put your hands down and instantly start typing on, I

446
00:26:03,915 --> 00:26:07,805
Speaker 6:  also really love Apple's normal magic keyboard. So

447
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:10,245
Speaker 6:  everyone's mileage may vary on that, but I think that's a great keyboard

448
00:26:10,705 --> 00:26:14,645
Speaker 6:  and this felt to my hands just like that, which is kind

449
00:26:14,645 --> 00:26:18,485
Speaker 6:  of all you'd want for this. I always thought the iPad Pros keyboard

450
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:22,605
Speaker 6:  was a little like mushy and sort of thick. Yeah. It just,

451
00:26:22,605 --> 00:26:25,725
Speaker 6:  it just felt like you had to sort of smash the keys all the time. And then

452
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:29,605
Speaker 6:  I spilled like half a diet Coke on mine and so now you have to really smash

453
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:33,485
Speaker 6:  the keys. But this one, at least in the

454
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:36,845
Speaker 6:  bits that I've gotten, felt fantastic. Like I instantly

455
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:41,045
Speaker 6:  want it as just a little kitchen computer that I can just

456
00:26:41,045 --> 00:26:42,725
Speaker 6:  sit and like write

457
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:45,925
Speaker 2:  Emails while I wait for my coffee to brew. Like, it felt great,

458
00:26:46,225 --> 00:26:49,725
Speaker 5:  But I have a question, which do you want more this

459
00:26:50,385 --> 00:26:51,405
Speaker 5:  or Microsoft Surface

460
00:26:53,385 --> 00:26:57,045
Speaker 5:  device? Because I it like the whole time watching this, the whole time talking

461
00:26:57,045 --> 00:26:59,805
Speaker 5:  about it, talking even about the, the stylist, I was like, this just feels

462
00:26:59,805 --> 00:27:03,565
Speaker 5:  kind of like Microsoft in 2017 or 2018. Right. Like

463
00:27:04,035 --> 00:27:07,325
Speaker 5:  when, when they and all the OEMs were really pushing like, yeah look it's

464
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:11,085
Speaker 5:  a touchscreen computer. And I'm like, yes. Now Apple has done

465
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:14,645
Speaker 5:  a touchscreen computer right down to talking about the processor. Yeah. Which

466
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:17,765
Speaker 5:  they didn't use to do with the iPad. Like this is just a computer.

467
00:27:18,755 --> 00:27:22,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. There was a, this was a speeds and feeds event. Yeah. It was fascinating

468
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:23,765
Speaker 2:  on that front. It really was super

469
00:27:23,765 --> 00:27:24,045
Speaker 5:  Weird.

470
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:28,925
Speaker 2:  Interesting. So it's interesting back then I think Windows

471
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:33,845
Speaker 2:  was in a weirder spot. Yeah. So they announced the surface and they're like,

472
00:27:33,845 --> 00:27:37,325
Speaker 2:  but then it's Windows and Windows

473
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:41,885
Speaker 2:  is in a sideways sort of fashion come a long way.

474
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:46,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Like I would say it's in a different spot, right? Is

475
00:27:46,045 --> 00:27:48,885
Speaker 2:  that spot ahead? It's more of a diagonal.

476
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:50,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. That you

477
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:53,565
Speaker 2:  Just kinda, it's gone this way. It's, it's come a distance. Yeah.

478
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,725
Speaker 2:  The direction I think is a, I'm

479
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:57,285
Speaker 5:  Sure it's a good

480
00:27:57,285 --> 00:28:01,165
Speaker 2:  Direction and I I only say that because you can argue about what the evolution

481
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:04,605
Speaker 2:  of Windows Yeah. To contrast with the fact that the iPad

482
00:28:05,025 --> 00:28:08,885
Speaker 2:  is in exactly the same place as it was. Yes. I went back

483
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:12,205
Speaker 2:  and I read my iPad air review from 2013, which in a

484
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:15,565
Speaker 2:  horrifying sequence of events, I forgot that I had written.

485
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:18,245
Speaker 5:  You're like, oh this guy's pretty good.

486
00:28:18,245 --> 00:28:21,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's like, oh, smart snappy. Oh that's me. There it is.

487
00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:26,765
Speaker 2:  And it is exactly the same that iPad was running iPad

488
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,805
Speaker 2:  OS seven. iOS seven. Yeah. In my review is like,

489
00:28:30,915 --> 00:28:34,685
Speaker 2:  this thing is constantly fighting you. They have not done enough with this

490
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:38,285
Speaker 2:  software to take advantage of the larger screen. The, and it's just like

491
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:41,925
Speaker 2:  plaintiff, like why is Siri so weird on this? Like why is it, why is it just

492
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:45,845
Speaker 2:  a big iPhone? I read my iPad Pro review from 2018 when

493
00:28:45,845 --> 00:28:49,445
Speaker 2:  it the first USPC one and I'm like, why is this computer fighting me? Like

494
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:54,445
Speaker 2:  why is file management on the iPad so confused? Yeah. And

495
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:57,525
Speaker 2:  all that stuff has gotten incrementally better. Yep. They've added stage

496
00:28:57,525 --> 00:29:01,285
Speaker 2:  manager shortcut shortcuts. People, I'm so proud of you for

497
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:05,085
Speaker 2:  writing an alternative operating system in shortcuts on top of iPad os

498
00:29:06,115 --> 00:29:09,845
Speaker 2:  that is an achieve. I, you know, that's cool as hell. That's like,

499
00:29:10,425 --> 00:29:13,965
Speaker 2:  I'm a computer nerd. I'm happy you did computer nerd stuff. But the,

500
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:17,325
Speaker 2:  the ultimate problem, which is you have to fight the computer

501
00:29:18,305 --> 00:29:22,285
Speaker 2:  to get it to be a computer, like remains as true for the iPad

502
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:26,165
Speaker 2:  today as it did in 2013 when I was running Iowa seven. Yeah. And this,

503
00:29:26,345 --> 00:29:30,205
Speaker 2:  and I think my answer to you then, given that question is like, I'd

504
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:31,965
Speaker 2:  rather take the weird sideways windows.

505
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:37,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Because at le at least it's gonna do everything that

506
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:40,205
Speaker 2:  I want it to do with without

507
00:29:41,355 --> 00:29:41,645
Speaker 2:  some

508
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:44,645
Speaker 5:  Like, like putting on armor and just going to war with your operat.

509
00:29:44,645 --> 00:29:47,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Just like running into like the brick wall of apple's business model.

510
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:50,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Right. Apple's like, we're gonna distribute all the applications to

511
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:54,325
Speaker 2:  the app store. We're gonna take 30% of all those buttons. Like, and that

512
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:57,525
Speaker 2:  will, and if we open that up on the iPad, then we're terrified that we'll

513
00:29:57,525 --> 00:30:01,285
Speaker 2:  have to open it up on the iPhone. We're already being brats about opening,

514
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:05,245
Speaker 2:  opening it up on the iPhone. Like no, like we're, it's gonna be

515
00:30:05,245 --> 00:30:09,045
Speaker 2:  like this, this is the future of computing. And then you're like,

516
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:09,525
Speaker 2:  is it?

517
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it really doesn't. It feels just like they made a

518
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:17,965
Speaker 5:  hobbled surface device, like a, my to be

519
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:22,005
Speaker 5:  clear, my dream service device in 2018, but a hobbled

520
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:25,565
Speaker 5:  surface device right down to the fact that you have to choose the processor,

521
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:30,365
Speaker 5:  the storage, like the markups are high to make it functional.

522
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:31,765
Speaker 2:  So the thing we don't know weird

523
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:31,965
Speaker 5:  Thing,

524
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:34,885
Speaker 2:  The thing we don't know is like what's gonna happen in June. That's true.

525
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:35,245
Speaker 5:  That's

526
00:30:35,245 --> 00:30:39,165
Speaker 2:  True. When a rev iPad os and that's what to me, David, I

527
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:42,165
Speaker 2:  couldn't tell if while you were at the watch parties and they had one in

528
00:30:42,165 --> 00:30:45,045
Speaker 2:  New York and one in London, like maybe the vibes were different all around

529
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:47,485
Speaker 2:  the world. But for me sitting at home

530
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,685
Speaker 2:  watching it in the glorious still be atmos of my own home

531
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,645
Speaker 2:  app. Apple, by the way, did not stream this thing at any more than like eight

532
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,965
Speaker 2:  megabits per second. I'm just saying.

533
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:59,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So it was not in Sony Bravia Corps.

534
00:30:59,235 --> 00:31:02,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It was at 48 Kilohertz Atmos, which was great. But I mean, come on,

535
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:06,445
Speaker 2:  where's the, where's the resolution man? You're gonna show John turn whipping

536
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:10,325
Speaker 2:  around the BART holding an iPad. I want, I want the full Anyway,

537
00:31:10,725 --> 00:31:14,645
Speaker 2:  I was like, man, like I can't wait until next month

538
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:17,245
Speaker 2:  when they finish this product. Yeah.

539
00:31:17,795 --> 00:31:21,565
Speaker 5:  Like exactly. It, it just felt like, okay, you've, you've announced

540
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:25,245
Speaker 5:  this thing that we've already seen before. We've already heard the pitch

541
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:28,645
Speaker 5:  that this kind of computer is really good for creatives. Because that was

542
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:31,085
Speaker 5:  the whole pitch, right? It was like, look, this is for creatives. I was like,

543
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:34,765
Speaker 5:  yeah, I heard that from Microsoft and HP and everybody else back in

544
00:31:34,765 --> 00:31:36,085
Speaker 5:  2018. I know that now.

545
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,645
Speaker 2:  And you've heard that from Apple about the iPad. Yeah.

546
00:31:38,985 --> 00:31:42,645
Speaker 5:  And like, okay, show me. And they're like, yeah, we did it. No, no, but show

547
00:31:42,645 --> 00:31:45,725
Speaker 5:  me where it's actually good for creatives now where it's actually that useful

548
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:49,005
Speaker 5:  computer. All you've done is like crush a bunch of stuff with a hydraulic

549
00:31:49,285 --> 00:31:49,685
Speaker 5:  crossing. Wait,

550
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:50,805
Speaker 2:  I want to come to the crushing. Yeah, well

551
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:52,325
Speaker 5:  Look into that. Yeah. Yeah. That's the

552
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:55,685
Speaker 2:  Other thing. But I'm curious, David, if that came through at the, whatever

553
00:31:55,685 --> 00:31:58,765
Speaker 2:  the, when it was a wa it wasn't like a full event, but I'm curious if it

554
00:31:58,765 --> 00:31:59,965
Speaker 2:  came through there. Yeah, I think

555
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:03,845
Speaker 6:  It, it was hard to tell at the event whether this was the

556
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:07,845
Speaker 6:  end of something or the beginning of something. And one

557
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:11,045
Speaker 6:  way to look at this event is that essentially Apple like finished the job

558
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:13,765
Speaker 6:  of the iPad, right? They said this over and over and over again. They're

559
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,005
Speaker 6:  like, this is the the magical pane of glass. Right? Yeah. Like that's the

560
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:20,445
Speaker 6:  thing they've been wanting to build for a really long time. And like they,

561
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:24,205
Speaker 6:  they built a really nice one. It has an outrageous amount of raw

562
00:32:24,205 --> 00:32:27,685
Speaker 6:  horsepower. It's really light, it's really thin. The screen looks awesome.

563
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:31,565
Speaker 6:  Like you could make the case that they have been sort of working toward

564
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:35,245
Speaker 6:  this particular iPad since the beginning of the iPad. And I think like

565
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:39,005
Speaker 6:  they said over and over, this is the biggest day in the iPad since the launch

566
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:43,045
Speaker 6:  of the iPad. Which like objectively not true. But If, you wanna look at it

567
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:47,005
Speaker 6:  that way. This is the end of that journey in a certain way. Like I

568
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:50,845
Speaker 6:  genuinely don't know how much further you can push the actual

569
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:55,005
Speaker 6:  details of the hardware here than what this is now until we get to like

570
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:58,725
Speaker 6:  rollable display. It's in something that's like, this feels like an end point

571
00:32:58,725 --> 00:33:02,485
Speaker 6:  in a real way. Or the flip side is this

572
00:33:02,505 --> 00:33:05,845
Speaker 6:  is the thing that is going to empower all of the things that Apple's gonna

573
00:33:05,845 --> 00:33:08,925
Speaker 6:  launch in June. And that was all the stuff that they were sort of intimating

574
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:12,845
Speaker 6:  with the AI stuff and talking about the features and you know, leaning on.

575
00:33:12,845 --> 00:33:15,365
Speaker 6:  We're gonna have more to say about the future of the platform in June. I

576
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:19,645
Speaker 6:  don't think this running Mac os is the answer for the iPad.

577
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:22,285
Speaker 6:  And there are a lot of people who are like, the evidence is everywhere. They're

578
00:33:22,285 --> 00:33:25,045
Speaker 6:  gonna have Mac Os on the iPad. Like no, they're not. It's just not gonna

579
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:28,725
Speaker 6:  happen. But if there is a next

580
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:33,165
Speaker 6:  turn for what the iPad can be and do and like a fundamental shift

581
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:36,965
Speaker 6:  in the use case, that's when this feels like the beginning of

582
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:39,405
Speaker 6:  something. Right. And now they're like, we have a different kind of hardware

583
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:43,485
Speaker 6:  with a different set of accessories and a different performance envelope

584
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:47,165
Speaker 6:  that can actually go do all of this new stuff. Yeah. And this is the story

585
00:33:47,165 --> 00:33:50,845
Speaker 6:  everybody has been telling us about AI for like damn near two years now and

586
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:54,805
Speaker 6:  none of it's really been true. So I'm not ultra

587
00:33:54,805 --> 00:33:58,765
Speaker 6:  confident that Apple is going to have like, massively improved the state

588
00:33:58,765 --> 00:34:01,925
Speaker 6:  of the art of AI and has solved all the features for everybody in June.

589
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:06,085
Speaker 6:  But this did it, it felt very much like

590
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:10,605
Speaker 6:  this is the vessel and we're gonna fill it a month from now and if not this

591
00:34:10,605 --> 00:34:14,485
Speaker 6:  will feel like the end of an era of the iPad. To me, how

592
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,765
Speaker 5:  Does AI fix iPad

593
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:19,765
Speaker 2:  Os Wait, I, I wanna come to, I I think that's where I wanna end. Okay. Sorry.

594
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:23,205
Speaker 2:  Sorry. I, I definitely wanna end there. Yeah. I just want to, before we get

595
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:26,365
Speaker 2:  to that, 'cause I think that's, that's the right place to end for sure. And

596
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:27,645
Speaker 2:  I think that's another hour of the show.

597
00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:32,685
Speaker 2:  I just want to call out the biggest day of the iPad since the iPad

598
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:37,285
Speaker 2:  off the top of my head I can think of three more important

599
00:34:37,415 --> 00:34:41,165
Speaker 2:  iPads than these that like move the needle the iPad two. Yep.

600
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:45,445
Speaker 2:  Which was a like a shock announcement and the design

601
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:49,165
Speaker 2:  direction of the iPad two was basically the iPad until

602
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:52,725
Speaker 2:  Monday. Yep. Like that ninth gen iPad

603
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:56,245
Speaker 2:  with the lightning connector, like slightly different design like, but it

604
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:59,965
Speaker 2:  was it's an iPad too. Yeah. Yep. They just flattened it a little bit. Yep.

605
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:03,685
Speaker 2:  Right. That But it's the same exact home button bezels the whole thing.

606
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:07,485
Speaker 2:  That's an iPad too. And that iPad two launch Steve

607
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:10,685
Speaker 2:  Jobs on the stage being like, I did it again. You saw the first gen iPad,

608
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:14,485
Speaker 2:  here's the second one. And this I, this is always my

609
00:35:14,485 --> 00:35:18,405
Speaker 2:  test. That shit made the local news. Yeah. Right. If, you If you

610
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:21,245
Speaker 2:  wanna breakthrough on the mainstream. You need ABC seven in Chicago to be

611
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:24,885
Speaker 2:  like, I have one I a new iPad today. Like, you gotta do it, you gotta get

612
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:28,805
Speaker 2:  there. The iPad four, which

613
00:35:28,805 --> 00:35:32,245
Speaker 2:  was the retina display and lightning connector, the iPad three had a retina

614
00:35:32,245 --> 00:35:36,165
Speaker 2:  display, but it was way too early and it was thicker and the thing ran

615
00:35:36,265 --> 00:35:40,205
Speaker 2:  so hot, the battery life was garbage. iPad four was the good one. Yep.

616
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:44,125
Speaker 2:  Huge big deal. Everybody I know who had an iPad immediately upgraded to that

617
00:35:44,155 --> 00:35:48,005
Speaker 2:  iPad. And then the original iPad error where they

618
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:51,485
Speaker 2:  changed it to the boxier design and they like gave it the extra capabilities.

619
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:56,285
Speaker 2:  That was a big deal. Which is why I was reading my 2013 review

620
00:35:56,535 --> 00:36:00,405
Speaker 2:  where they, they redid the form factor to make it that more square.

621
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:04,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And a form factor change is always just a big deal. Right?

622
00:36:04,355 --> 00:36:07,245
Speaker 5:  Like none of the ones you mentioned though were when they got rid of the

623
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:07,445
Speaker 5:  button.

624
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:09,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. 'cause whatever

625
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:10,565
Speaker 5:  You don't care about the button.

626
00:36:11,805 --> 00:36:14,845
Speaker 2:  I I believe that was the original iPad Pro. Yeah, I think you're right. It's

627
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:18,285
Speaker 2:  the 2018 iPad Pro. And that one I would say was not a big deal because that's

628
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:22,125
Speaker 2:  when they added the keyboard and they like got real surfacey and I'm just

629
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:25,245
Speaker 2:  using my local news test. That thing was really expensive.

630
00:36:26,265 --> 00:36:30,165
Speaker 2:  It tried it, tried to make it a laptop and it, I I did it

631
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:30,365
Speaker 2:  work?

632
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:32,045
Speaker 5:  Did it go on the local news?

633
00:36:32,705 --> 00:36:35,885
Speaker 2:  I'm just saying off the top of my head. Well if you're just ranking the biggest

634
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:40,405
Speaker 2:  iPads, the things that made the iPad breakthrough to the mainstream and

635
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:44,365
Speaker 2:  like cause a fuss. It's 100% the

636
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:48,285
Speaker 2:  iPad too. Yes. Like easily the most beat You're ranking the

637
00:36:48,285 --> 00:36:52,005
Speaker 2:  biggest moments for the iPad Since the iPad. The iPad two is at the top of

638
00:36:52,005 --> 00:36:55,765
Speaker 2:  that list. Yeah. Without question then. I think it is the iPad four

639
00:36:55,765 --> 00:36:59,485
Speaker 2:  when all of the early adopters of the iPad upgraded. 'cause the hardware

640
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:02,485
Speaker 2:  had a new capability in the retina screen that was worthwhile instead of

641
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:05,605
Speaker 2:  the iPad three, which again had a retina screen but was also a tiny nuclear

642
00:37:05,635 --> 00:37:09,445
Speaker 2:  reactor. And then the, the iPad error, which was the big

643
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:13,325
Speaker 2:  form factor shift that everybody upgraded to Right. And also passed the local

644
00:37:13,325 --> 00:37:16,525
Speaker 2:  news test of Apple has a new iPad. It was thinner than ever before. Like

645
00:37:16,675 --> 00:37:17,165
Speaker 2:  that thing

646
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:21,485
Speaker 5:  I I do wanna tell you that in fact the, the event this week did pass the

647
00:37:21,485 --> 00:37:22,045
Speaker 5:  local news test

648
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:23,285
Speaker 2:  You're watching ABC seven,

649
00:37:23,665 --> 00:37:26,605
Speaker 5:  ABC seven did in fact cover it. Oh, now it's covering the streaming bundle.

650
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:29,005
Speaker 2:  ABC seven in Chicago.

651
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:33,085
Speaker 5:  Just going. But, but yeah, they were just like Apple unveils

652
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:37,005
Speaker 5:  new iPad Pro with outrageously powerful AI powered chip.

653
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:40,085
Speaker 2:  All right. I'm not gonna tell you why I think about ABC seven news.

654
00:37:41,465 --> 00:37:42,925
Speaker 2:  It is what my mom watches. Okay.

655
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:46,925
Speaker 5:  But no, I I'm I'm with you like local news when it hits local news. So I

656
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:48,925
Speaker 5:  I'm genuinely surprised this hit

657
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:51,165
Speaker 2:  They need something, right? Yeah. It was

658
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:52,205
Speaker 5:  A slow news week for 'em.

659
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:56,845
Speaker 2:  I just say that's my test. And I, that's to me is the God bless the

660
00:37:56,845 --> 00:37:59,765
Speaker 2:  people at ABC seven News. Yeah. I'm in Chicago for New Year's every year

661
00:37:59,765 --> 00:38:02,965
Speaker 2:  and they do a just a wild New Year's Eve thing. So that's why it's always

662
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:06,925
Speaker 2:  on my mind. But it is true. That's the one my, my mom watches. Oh.

663
00:38:08,345 --> 00:38:12,165
Speaker 2:  But I think about that test and it's like, did this pass the test where a

664
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:16,045
Speaker 2:  whole bunch of new people are gonna pick an iPad, are gonna buy an

665
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:19,445
Speaker 2:  iPad? And I don't, I don't think this hardware is that thing.

666
00:38:19,905 --> 00:38:22,365
Speaker 2:  No. Maybe at the top end of the scale, a bunch of people are gonna get an

667
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:26,205
Speaker 2:  iPad Pro 'cause they wanna do a barrel roll. I doubt I I'm that

668
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:30,005
Speaker 2:  person. I I'm not a tandem ole. Yeah. I'm in

669
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:32,965
Speaker 2:  Let's spend the money. I'm just, that's the thing I'm thinking about and

670
00:38:32,965 --> 00:38:36,765
Speaker 2:  that's where I'm with David where I'm like, you gotta, you gotta reset

671
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:40,645
Speaker 2:  your expectations of what the thing is capable of. Yeah. which I think brings

672
00:38:40,705 --> 00:38:44,565
Speaker 2:  me to the commercial and all this talk about

673
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:48,685
Speaker 2:  ai. Apple said a million times is the most powerful AI

674
00:38:48,845 --> 00:38:51,685
Speaker 2:  computer you can get because the M four, we've been doing the neural engine

675
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:55,565
Speaker 2:  for years. Here's the the

676
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:58,925
Speaker 2:  thing in logic where you can put in a song and it does the AI and it splits

677
00:38:58,925 --> 00:39:02,325
Speaker 2:  the stems into drums and guitars and vocals for you. That's cool.

678
00:39:02,785 --> 00:39:05,605
Speaker 2:  Here's some final cut Pro stuff. That's cool. by the way, final cut camera

679
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:09,685
Speaker 2:  on the iPhone. They announced, they just slid by that they announced pro

680
00:39:09,685 --> 00:39:12,085
Speaker 2:  camera software, right? Just for the iPhone. Just

681
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:12,645
Speaker 5:  Moved through

682
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:16,405
Speaker 2:  It. That rules like that's awesome. But you know, the thing's very

683
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:19,405
Speaker 2:  powerful. And then they're like, we're gonna have more AI features. You can

684
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:23,365
Speaker 2:  see they're gonna announce a ton of AI features at wwc. And I think what

685
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:26,925
Speaker 2:  is fascinating is maybe Apple's core

686
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:28,405
Speaker 2:  constituency hates it

687
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:33,245
Speaker 2:  and then this ad just like lit the fuse.

688
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:37,365
Speaker 5:  God, the ad was like unintentionally a flash point in what fells

689
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:41,125
Speaker 5:  like some sort of new class warfare Yeah. Between like big tech

690
00:39:41,385 --> 00:39:44,885
Speaker 5:  and creatives and, and we've been seeing it in Hollywood a lot, right? Yeah.

691
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:48,325
Speaker 5:  Like, like as Apple and Amazon and everybody goes and, and takes over streaming

692
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:52,205
Speaker 5:  there. Everybody's got really strong feelings about it. But to see it

693
00:39:52,205 --> 00:39:55,765
Speaker 5:  happen here, to see like Hugh Grant be like, this sucks. You're

694
00:39:55,765 --> 00:39:58,565
Speaker 5:  destroying the world. That was a really bad Hugh Grant impression. Yeah.

695
00:39:58,735 --> 00:39:59,405
Speaker 5:  Sorry. I

696
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:01,085
Speaker 2:  He's famously British. He's

697
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:03,885
Speaker 5:  Famously British. I'm, I'm, I'm I'm not. But

698
00:40:04,585 --> 00:40:08,405
Speaker 2:  The opposite of British the opposite. So the ad the ad is a bunch

699
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:11,045
Speaker 2:  of stuff like beautiful old creative stuff. Yeah.

700
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:12,685
Speaker 5:  It's like paint and phones and

701
00:40:12,685 --> 00:40:14,325
Speaker 2:  There's a, a trumpet I believe at the beginning.

702
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:18,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Trump a metronome, a sculpture that I thought was, was

703
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:21,485
Speaker 5:  like a sculpture and then it was clay. 'cause it just smooshed all

704
00:40:21,605 --> 00:40:25,045
Speaker 5:  unsatisfying in the hydraulic press. And it was like a really good

705
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:28,605
Speaker 5:  commercial. And it's the same thing they've done a billion times before where

706
00:40:28,605 --> 00:40:32,485
Speaker 5:  they're just like, what if all of this stuff was in the palm of

707
00:40:32,485 --> 00:40:36,405
Speaker 5:  your hand? And everybody's like, F off. Yeah.

708
00:40:36,905 --> 00:40:40,685
Speaker 5:  How dare you. You were And 'cause I think it was the, the, that image of

709
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:42,325
Speaker 5:  things being all crushed,

710
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:45,445
Speaker 2:  Being destroyed, like beautiful things being destroyed. Yeah. And to make

711
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:45,845
Speaker 2:  an iPad

712
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,325
Speaker 5:  And everybody out there in the world is, is really upset. There's a lot of

713
00:40:49,325 --> 00:40:52,805
Speaker 5:  anxiety around AI in so many creative

714
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:56,645
Speaker 5:  industries. So to have that happen is like, Ooh, you'll miss the

715
00:40:56,645 --> 00:40:57,805
Speaker 5:  mark on that one. Yeah.

716
00:40:58,025 --> 00:41:00,845
Speaker 6:  Can I just say, I think the, the like

717
00:41:01,395 --> 00:41:05,085
Speaker 6:  overarching point of the idea that technology is like literally

718
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:08,805
Speaker 6:  flattening creative culture good and fair and valid and

719
00:41:08,975 --> 00:41:12,885
Speaker 6:  worth fighting about the reaction to this commercial in particular is so

720
00:41:12,885 --> 00:41:15,485
Speaker 6:  stupid. It's, and I just wish everyone would get over it.

721
00:41:15,915 --> 00:41:16,645
Speaker 5:  It's so funny.

722
00:41:17,515 --> 00:41:21,405
Speaker 6:  Like I will say there was a great, I forget who did it and I'm sorry I can't

723
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:24,125
Speaker 6:  give them credit for it, but there was somebody who literally just ran that

724
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:26,965
Speaker 6:  commercial in reverse and was like, this is actually much more compelling.

725
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:29,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And sells the iPad much better than all of this stuff comes out of

726
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:33,005
Speaker 6:  the iPad. And I think that's very funny because it wasn't much more like

727
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:36,925
Speaker 6:  compelling. It was much version of the thing, but also

728
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:40,485
Speaker 6:  like the idea that everyone is like Apple has always loved

729
00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:44,405
Speaker 6:  creatives and now it's destroying trumpets is like, come on everybody. Like

730
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:48,685
Speaker 6:  it's, nothing has changed. Apple is trying to tell you that there's lots

731
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:52,365
Speaker 6:  of things that you can do in an iPad and the fact that smooshed a trumpet

732
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:55,645
Speaker 6:  to do so is probably fine. The thing is that it's probably fine.

733
00:41:55,985 --> 00:41:56,405
Speaker 6:  Things

734
00:41:56,435 --> 00:41:59,285
Speaker 5:  Have changed for a lot of folks, right? Like things have changed on the other

735
00:41:59,285 --> 00:42:02,565
Speaker 5:  side of it that was totally unrelated to Apple. Like Yeah. It really was

736
00:42:02,565 --> 00:42:05,205
Speaker 5:  just Apple just like stepping in it without even knowing they were stepping

737
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:08,405
Speaker 5:  in it. Because out there in the world people are furious at

738
00:42:08,815 --> 00:42:12,285
Speaker 5:  technology in general. And then Apple was just like, look, we did a cool

739
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:13,725
Speaker 5:  iPad. And everybody's like, you'll

740
00:42:13,725 --> 00:42:17,445
Speaker 6:  Die. Yeah. I agree with that. I think, I think the, the broader story here

741
00:42:17,445 --> 00:42:20,685
Speaker 6:  is real, right? Yeah. And Apple is out there talking about ai while everybody

742
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:24,005
Speaker 6:  is rightly nervous about what AI is going to mean to their creative work.

743
00:42:24,265 --> 00:42:27,285
Speaker 6:  All that stuff is totally fair and valid. It just isn't about this commercial.

744
00:42:28,385 --> 00:42:32,205
Speaker 2:  No, that's what I mean. I think the commercial is like, dude, in a

745
00:42:32,205 --> 00:42:35,885
Speaker 2:  month Apple is gonna announce AI features across its operating systems

746
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:39,885
Speaker 2:  like huge sweeping AI features

747
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:44,565
Speaker 2:  from the reports we've read. They're gonna add the we

748
00:42:44,585 --> 00:42:48,365
Speaker 2:  the AI photo editing to photos. Just imagine

749
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:51,165
Speaker 2:  the, what is a photo conversation we're gonna be having in a month when that

750
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:54,405
Speaker 2:  stuff is built in at the system level to the iPhone four

751
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:54,605
Speaker 5:  Hour

752
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:58,165
Speaker 2:  Vergecast. It's never gonna stop. We're just gonna start VERGE casting right

753
00:42:58,165 --> 00:43:00,965
Speaker 2:  after the keynote ends and we're going straight onto the end of the year.

754
00:43:02,155 --> 00:43:06,085
Speaker 2:  This is officially my two week notice. Liam's out. But

755
00:43:06,245 --> 00:43:10,005
Speaker 2:  I mean like they want to add generative AI

756
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:13,725
Speaker 2:  capabilities to the products directly. And I think what they just

757
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:17,285
Speaker 2:  learned is even a hint of breaking

758
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:21,525
Speaker 2:  creative stuff is bad for them. Like I think the reaction they add is like

759
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,805
Speaker 2:  one don't destroy cool things that we like,

760
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:29,605
Speaker 2:  like I'm David, I it sounds like you're disdain for trumpets is off the

761
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:33,485
Speaker 2:  charts. Yeah. Some people think trumpets are cool, right? There's

762
00:43:33,565 --> 00:43:36,245
Speaker 2:  ska bands across the world that are like, what are you doing?

763
00:43:36,595 --> 00:43:37,725
Speaker 5:  David's like, no to ska

764
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,165
Speaker 6:  Destroy all trumpets.

765
00:43:39,555 --> 00:43:42,845
Speaker 2:  There's, you know, there's like a retro arcade cons. Like it's it's just

766
00:43:42,845 --> 00:43:46,125
Speaker 2:  like cool stuff stuff. People like, and they're like Smash, we're doing one

767
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:50,085
Speaker 2:  of those tiktoks with the hydraulic smashers and now here's an iPad this

768
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:53,645
Speaker 2:  like sort of soulless corporate pane of glass, right?

769
00:43:55,145 --> 00:43:59,085
Speaker 2:  You take that anxiety just around this ad just around the imagery

770
00:43:59,085 --> 00:44:02,925
Speaker 2:  of that ad and you hand it, you like point it at

771
00:44:03,305 --> 00:44:07,005
Speaker 2:  iOS itself in a month and it's like, oh that's a powder

772
00:44:07,185 --> 00:44:08,285
Speaker 2:  keg actually. Yeah,

773
00:44:08,905 --> 00:44:12,845
Speaker 6:  It is. And, and Apple has been, I think the extent to which

774
00:44:12,865 --> 00:44:16,845
Speaker 6:  it has misread the room about how people think about Apple, I think

775
00:44:16,845 --> 00:44:19,805
Speaker 6:  is what has been most telling about this. Because there was a time when

776
00:44:20,695 --> 00:44:24,445
Speaker 6:  Apple really did convince creative

777
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:27,645
Speaker 6:  people that it was behind them, right? Yeah. And it was, it was making tools

778
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:30,645
Speaker 6:  even as it was disrupting the music industry and changing the way a lot of

779
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:34,085
Speaker 6:  this stuff worked. People who made things used Apple products. Like

780
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:37,685
Speaker 6:  overwhelmingly that was the case. And there was this sense that like, this

781
00:44:37,685 --> 00:44:41,045
Speaker 6:  company made good products in the right way and believes in creative people

782
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:44,485
Speaker 6:  and cared about this stuff. And Steve Jobs was a Pixar investor. Like all

783
00:44:44,485 --> 00:44:48,125
Speaker 6:  this stuff. And I think between the way that

784
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:51,965
Speaker 6:  Apple's business model has been sort of aired out like dirty laundry

785
00:44:52,035 --> 00:44:54,965
Speaker 6:  over the last couple of years and the way we've come to understand what it

786
00:44:54,965 --> 00:44:58,685
Speaker 6:  does to developers and the way that all of this stuff is just in

787
00:44:58,685 --> 00:45:02,565
Speaker 6:  general getting subsumed inside of technology. Like there's the bigger

788
00:45:02,615 --> 00:45:05,925
Speaker 6:  story about what technology is doing to the world and to creative people

789
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:08,885
Speaker 6:  that I think is interesting and important. But there's also a thing that

790
00:45:08,885 --> 00:45:12,005
Speaker 6:  has happened where people don't look at Apple the way Apple thinks that they

791
00:45:12,005 --> 00:45:15,565
Speaker 6:  do anymore. And I think to me that was the thing that was most interesting

792
00:45:15,565 --> 00:45:18,565
Speaker 6:  about this was a bunch of people who otherwise would've been like, oh,

793
00:45:19,115 --> 00:45:21,565
Speaker 6:  Apple's, you know, one of the good ones, they actually care about this stuff.

794
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:24,205
Speaker 6:  It's a, it's a huge tech company that actually like does the right things

795
00:45:24,225 --> 00:45:27,965
Speaker 6:  the right way. That company does not get the benefit of the doubt anymore.

796
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:30,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. No. And I don't know that that's coming back and I think it's gonna

797
00:45:31,065 --> 00:45:33,605
Speaker 6:  really hurt it with AI in a really big way.

798
00:45:33,985 --> 00:45:37,685
Speaker 2:  The thing that I have thought about the moment, like specific phrase

799
00:45:37,795 --> 00:45:41,565
Speaker 2:  that I have been thinking about during this whole commercial kerfuffle, which

800
00:45:41,565 --> 00:45:44,645
Speaker 2:  I agree is I, it's about something else. Yeah. Right.

801
00:45:45,345 --> 00:45:49,285
Speaker 2:  But I have been thinking a lot about Steve Jobs introducing the iPhone

802
00:45:49,285 --> 00:45:52,965
Speaker 2:  four and he held it up and he was admiring his own product in the way that

803
00:45:52,965 --> 00:45:56,685
Speaker 2:  Steve Jobs was want to do. And he said it's like a beautiful old, like a

804
00:45:56,685 --> 00:45:56,845
Speaker 2:  camera

805
00:45:58,745 --> 00:46:02,325
Speaker 2:  And he meant it, right? Like he was like, this is,

806
00:46:03,245 --> 00:46:07,005
Speaker 2:  I loved that thing and I made a thing that is like it

807
00:46:07,945 --> 00:46:11,925
Speaker 2:  and this thing is actually meant to honor that thing. Right. You

808
00:46:11,925 --> 00:46:14,885
Speaker 2:  could, he you just go watch it. You go watch the iPhone four introduction.

809
00:46:15,115 --> 00:46:17,445
Speaker 2:  It's funny 'cause you like dunk some gizmo at the beginning. I'm sorry Alex.

810
00:46:17,635 --> 00:46:21,165
Speaker 2:  It's fine. Alex wasn't there yet. I wasn't there yet. But it's like, you

811
00:46:21,165 --> 00:46:24,205
Speaker 2:  know, it's like a whole thing, right? It's Steve Jobs has to

812
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:28,885
Speaker 2:  reannounce the product that has been so thoroughly leaked that it has already

813
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:30,165
Speaker 2:  been disassembled on the internet

814
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:35,565
Speaker 2:  and he like does a great job. He does. But there's this moment that

815
00:46:35,565 --> 00:46:38,485
Speaker 2:  makes it work that like, makes it click where he is. Like it is like a beautiful,

816
00:46:38,485 --> 00:46:42,245
Speaker 2:  like a camera. And he is just talking about a piece of design that he loves,

817
00:46:42,515 --> 00:46:46,365
Speaker 2:  that represents a way of doing things that he obviously respects. And

818
00:46:46,365 --> 00:46:47,725
Speaker 2:  that's, now here's his iPhone.

819
00:46:48,165 --> 00:46:51,365
Speaker 6:  Contrast that to buy your mom an iPhone. Like that's, that's the journey.

820
00:46:51,505 --> 00:46:55,125
Speaker 2:  But yeah, contrast that to buy your mom an iPhone. Contrast that to we're

821
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:58,285
Speaker 2:  gonna smash everything into your iPad. Yeah. Right? It's like, oh, now we're

822
00:46:58,285 --> 00:47:01,605
Speaker 2:  a bulldozer. Yeah. Not a participant in this thing.

823
00:47:02,215 --> 00:47:05,445
Speaker 2:  Right? We're not gonna honor the past of creativity with blah blah blah blah

824
00:47:05,445 --> 00:47:08,085
Speaker 2:  blah. Yeah. We've commodified creativity. We are a bunch of accountants who

825
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:11,685
Speaker 2:  are gonna take our 30% and that is bad. Like I,

826
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:15,565
Speaker 2:  whatever it is, and I'm sure someone's gonna write to me about Apple stock

827
00:47:15,565 --> 00:47:18,725
Speaker 2:  performance now. Like whatever you wanna think about that, that's great.

828
00:47:18,995 --> 00:47:22,925
Speaker 2:  They're dominant. People love them, but they don't, the

829
00:47:22,925 --> 00:47:26,725
Speaker 2:  benefit of the doubt where the company was led by an artist

830
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:30,205
Speaker 2:  or someone who held himself out as an artist or a patron of the arts or whatever

831
00:47:30,785 --> 00:47:34,445
Speaker 2:  is gone. And I think this ad is actually a

832
00:47:34,445 --> 00:47:38,205
Speaker 2:  reflection of that, right? It's just, it's an ad, it's a very expensive

833
00:47:38,265 --> 00:47:41,805
Speaker 2:  ad, but it's not born out of a love of those things

834
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:46,165
Speaker 2:  because If, you truly loved those things. You would not smash them.

835
00:47:48,025 --> 00:47:50,405
Speaker 2:  And like maybe that's just a metaphor, maybe it's silly, maybe it's just

836
00:47:50,405 --> 00:47:54,245
Speaker 2:  a misfire. But a month from now they're gonna launch

837
00:47:54,365 --> 00:47:58,325
Speaker 2:  a bunch of AI features that are trained on a bunch of creative work

838
00:47:58,385 --> 00:48:01,085
Speaker 2:  and they're gonna have to answer a bunch of questions about whether or not

839
00:48:01,085 --> 00:48:03,805
Speaker 2:  they paid for that training data and whether artists are gonna compensate

840
00:48:03,805 --> 00:48:07,645
Speaker 2:  it. And whether If you type into GarageBand make me a beat in the style

841
00:48:07,645 --> 00:48:11,405
Speaker 2:  of whoever that person gets money. And like, are you

842
00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:15,365
Speaker 2:  ready for this? Because the reaction to this ad

843
00:48:15,805 --> 00:48:19,365
Speaker 2:  suggests that you are not, yeah. And I, the same is true Google

844
00:48:19,715 --> 00:48:23,245
Speaker 2:  next week is Google io where they're gonna announce a bunch of ai, like

845
00:48:24,595 --> 00:48:28,525
Speaker 2:  it's just destined to happen. Like I, I can confidently predict

846
00:48:28,525 --> 00:48:30,845
Speaker 2:  that Google is gonna announce a bunch of AI stuff at Google ai.

847
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:32,325
Speaker 5:  We are gonna talk about Gemini a lot.

848
00:48:32,715 --> 00:48:36,685
Speaker 2:  They're gonna put Gemini in your face and are they ready? Are they

849
00:48:36,685 --> 00:48:40,605
Speaker 2:  ready for that stuff this week? Open AI is, they're leak details of

850
00:48:40,605 --> 00:48:44,205
Speaker 2:  how they're going out to publishers and the publishers are like, you already

851
00:48:44,205 --> 00:48:47,965
Speaker 2:  scraped the data. This is a, this is a head fake. We, we don't trust you.

852
00:48:48,585 --> 00:48:51,885
Speaker 2:  And I, I think this whole industry is kinda like on a razor's edge. Like

853
00:48:51,885 --> 00:48:55,245
Speaker 2:  they don't understand that the lack of trust around AI

854
00:48:55,705 --> 00:48:59,445
Speaker 2:  is gonna come to all of their products, including a relatively

855
00:48:59,475 --> 00:49:01,205
Speaker 2:  innocuous iPad ad. Yeah,

856
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:02,445
Speaker 6:  Agreed.

857
00:49:03,005 --> 00:49:03,525
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent.

858
00:49:03,795 --> 00:49:07,445
Speaker 2:  Alright. I'm very curious now to see what Iowa 17 brings in. by the way,

859
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:10,685
Speaker 2:  David, what is the evidence real quick before we break that, that's gonna

860
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:11,965
Speaker 2:  run Mac West? 'cause that would be my dream.

861
00:49:12,805 --> 00:49:15,325
Speaker 6:  I don't know, there's just a lot of, I think a lot of people who are like,

862
00:49:15,325 --> 00:49:18,685
Speaker 6:  oh, the magic keyboard exists and feels more like a Mac. There's a bigger

863
00:49:18,695 --> 00:49:20,045
Speaker 6:  track pad. People

864
00:49:20,205 --> 00:49:20,605
Speaker 7:  Just want

865
00:49:20,605 --> 00:49:24,485
Speaker 6:  It. Thus, Mac SII challenge anyone to like,

866
00:49:24,705 --> 00:49:28,645
Speaker 6:  try and think about how you would touch the things in your menu bar. Like

867
00:49:28,645 --> 00:49:32,045
Speaker 6:  it's just not a good idea. We should have Mac apps that work should,

868
00:49:32,045 --> 00:49:34,165
Speaker 2:  There's rules. I'm done poking away over here. This is great.

869
00:49:34,525 --> 00:49:37,245
Speaker 5:  I got, I'm trying to, I'm trying to scroll down so I get my menu bar.

870
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:42,005
Speaker 6:  No, I, as far as I can tell, there is no actual evidence except this thing

871
00:49:42,005 --> 00:49:45,045
Speaker 6:  is stupendously powerful and when you put it in, it kind of feels like a

872
00:49:45,045 --> 00:49:45,365
Speaker 6:  laptop.

873
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:49,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All right, though, that's my dream. If you're listening to me, Tim,

874
00:49:50,205 --> 00:49:51,925
Speaker 2:  I will trust you again. If. you put Mac

875
00:49:51,925 --> 00:49:55,525
Speaker 6:  West in, it's a bad dream. Tim, don't listen. Turn off the podcast.

876
00:49:56,185 --> 00:49:59,645
Speaker 2:  Tim is in our YouTube comments. He's like, first, that's him every time.

877
00:50:00,185 --> 00:50:03,045
Speaker 2:  All right. We gotta take a break. We'll be right back. And then Alex is gonna

878
00:50:03,045 --> 00:50:06,965
Speaker 2:  tell us about streaming. So buckle up. We'll be right

879
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:07,085
Speaker 2:  back.

880
00:50:55,665 --> 00:50:56,925
Speaker 9:  but this year's contest comes

881
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:18,285
Speaker 5:  That's why you're listening. Don't worry. I get it.

882
00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:21,605
Speaker 2:  The good news is there's not a lot of direct Zav news

883
00:52:21,695 --> 00:52:25,125
Speaker 5:  There. There isn't. No, they had, they had their earnings. Disney's had their

884
00:52:25,325 --> 00:52:27,845
Speaker 5:  earnings. A lot of folks had their earnings this week. And they're, they're,

885
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:31,165
Speaker 5:  they're doing okay. They're making money. And that's

886
00:52:31,355 --> 00:52:34,685
Speaker 5:  because they have things like ads. Yeah. And, and they're running these companies

887
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:38,605
Speaker 5:  like businesses that have to make money now rather than just

888
00:52:38,605 --> 00:52:42,565
Speaker 5:  like giving us all free content all the time, which was super sick. That's

889
00:52:42,565 --> 00:52:46,485
Speaker 5:  great. And I'll miss those years, like crazy. But the big stuff was like,

890
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:50,165
Speaker 5:  Disney, Hulu and Max are all gonna, they're gonna get a bundle at some point

891
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:51,285
Speaker 5:  this summer, not your child.

892
00:52:52,705 --> 00:52:55,245
Speaker 2:  You know, she walked up to the TV the other day and said, why is there an

893
00:52:55,355 --> 00:52:59,125
Speaker 2:  icon? And said, max. And I, honestly, I

894
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:02,565
Speaker 2:  challenge you to explain that to a 6-year-old in a way that makes any sense.

895
00:53:02,575 --> 00:53:03,085
Speaker 2:  First of

896
00:53:03,085 --> 00:53:04,045
Speaker 9:  All, kudos to Max

897
00:53:04,305 --> 00:53:05,365
Speaker 2:  Can read that rules.

898
00:53:05,495 --> 00:53:06,565
Speaker 9:  Great. Great job, max.

899
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:10,525
Speaker 5:  That's awesome. Yeah. Did you start explaining David Zalo to her?

900
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:11,165
Speaker 5:  Like

901
00:53:11,865 --> 00:53:15,045
Speaker 2:  Did you start, like, I just challenge you to expl, like try be like you're

902
00:53:15,245 --> 00:53:19,045
Speaker 2:  six years old. You, you cannot start with, there once was a company called

903
00:53:19,075 --> 00:53:20,125
Speaker 2:  Time Warner. That's

904
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:20,405
Speaker 5:  What I was hoping.

905
00:53:20,505 --> 00:53:23,725
Speaker 2:  But you Right. Like that you're just like, there was a mistake.

906
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:25,645
Speaker 2:  That's a mistake. This

907
00:53:25,645 --> 00:53:29,565
Speaker 5:  Is how you write a children's book for Max. Just to explain that

908
00:53:29,575 --> 00:53:33,005
Speaker 2:  There was a mistake inside of that icon

909
00:53:33,455 --> 00:53:36,885
Speaker 2:  rests a four three grayscale Batman movie.

910
00:53:37,425 --> 00:53:41,405
Speaker 2:  And I just, I'm sorry. Okay. Like the entire

911
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:44,805
Speaker 2:  one day, I will tell you the story of the American economy and it will start

912
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:45,485
Speaker 2:  with that icon.

913
00:53:47,025 --> 00:53:48,565
Speaker 5:  But for now, don't worry about it, max.

914
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:52,085
Speaker 2:  Okay. So this is where we get to Zla. Obviously Zla runs Warner Brothers

915
00:53:52,085 --> 00:53:55,125
Speaker 2:  Discovery. He's been looking for money. Yeah. He's been looking for growth

916
00:53:55,705 --> 00:53:59,565
Speaker 5:  And, and what better way than to partner up with other companies who

917
00:53:59,565 --> 00:54:02,765
Speaker 5:  are also looking for growth and being like, if we get together, we can offer,

918
00:54:02,815 --> 00:54:06,365
Speaker 5:  offer our stuff cheaper and also not have the FTC come after us

919
00:54:07,415 --> 00:54:10,485
Speaker 5:  constantly for having our own little like, fiefdoms.

920
00:54:11,265 --> 00:54:15,045
Speaker 2:  So they're gonna bundle this up and say, is it,

921
00:54:15,105 --> 00:54:17,445
Speaker 2:  is it gonna be two different apps? Is it three? So I guess Hulu is already

922
00:54:17,445 --> 00:54:18,565
Speaker 2:  in Disney Plus, right?

923
00:54:18,785 --> 00:54:21,965
Speaker 5:  Hulu's already in Disney Plus. That's why it's like that gross color now.

924
00:54:21,995 --> 00:54:22,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

925
00:54:23,035 --> 00:54:26,005
Speaker 2:  They, they're just like, they smashed the balloon to green together. So you

926
00:54:26,065 --> 00:54:29,165
Speaker 2:  you, you sign up, I read the press releases. The press releases are like,

927
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:30,805
Speaker 2:  we'll release more details later. Yeah. There,

928
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:33,205
Speaker 5:  There really isn't a lot of details. It really is just like it's coming.

929
00:54:33,595 --> 00:54:36,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We don't know pricing. We don't know when we just know what's happening.

930
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:36,285
Speaker 5:  So

931
00:54:36,285 --> 00:54:39,005
Speaker 2:  You're gonna pay some money Yeah. To someone.

932
00:54:39,825 --> 00:54:42,685
Speaker 5:  Yes. They're gonna figure it out, Eli, and then like, David's very good at

933
00:54:42,685 --> 00:54:44,365
Speaker 5:  this Zaz Love not Pierce.

934
00:54:44,505 --> 00:54:48,005
Speaker 2:  And then you're gonna, I feel like if David Pierce was in charge with, in

935
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:49,165
Speaker 2:  charge of Warner Brother's discovery.

936
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:53,245
Speaker 6:  I was gonna say, I honestly believe, like to my bones, that I could run the

937
00:54:53,245 --> 00:54:56,325
Speaker 6:  streaming industry more successfully than any of these clowns. Oh, you

938
00:54:56,485 --> 00:54:58,805
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent the user interface would work.

939
00:54:59,075 --> 00:55:03,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I I just let David do it. Yeah, that's what I'm

940
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:05,925
Speaker 2:  saying. You're gonna log into two apps. You're gonna have two apps on your,

941
00:55:06,025 --> 00:55:08,205
Speaker 2:  on your Roku still. We don't know.

942
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:10,965
Speaker 5:  We don't know. Yeah. We, we genuinely don't know most of this stuff. We know

943
00:55:10,965 --> 00:55:14,485
Speaker 5:  that it's, it's coming. We know that there, they're excited about it.

944
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:18,725
Speaker 6:  I would say by the way, that there is virtually no chance of this being

945
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:22,685
Speaker 6:  a combined app. Like just from what we've seen on the

946
00:55:22,685 --> 00:55:26,525
Speaker 6:  right. Stuff alone. Like Disney, the work they had to do

947
00:55:26,545 --> 00:55:30,485
Speaker 6:  to integrate the Hulu stuff with Disney Plus, and those are two companies

948
00:55:30,485 --> 00:55:34,245
Speaker 6:  owned by Disney. Yeah. Just the right stuff

949
00:55:34,245 --> 00:55:38,085
Speaker 6:  that wouldn't allow some things on Hulu to be in Disney Plus. So there are

950
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:41,445
Speaker 6:  things that are in Hulu, the app that are not in Hulu, the tile and Disney

951
00:55:41,445 --> 00:55:45,325
Speaker 6:  Plus, like imagine adding all of a whole nother company to

952
00:55:45,325 --> 00:55:49,125
Speaker 6:  that. I just don't see how that's possible. Like this is, this is good. They're

953
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:52,845
Speaker 6:  going for Unified login, which is a good idea,

954
00:55:52,985 --> 00:55:55,805
Speaker 6:  is like the most ambitious thing I think comes out of

955
00:55:55,805 --> 00:55:58,765
Speaker 2:  This. Yeah. But the entire idea of these roll-ups to begin with, Disney buying,

956
00:55:58,945 --> 00:56:01,405
Speaker 2:  Fox buying out the rest of Hulu from Comcast

957
00:56:02,295 --> 00:56:06,285
Speaker 2:  disclosure, Comcast as a stake in our parent company, Vox Media,

958
00:56:06,305 --> 00:56:08,645
Speaker 2:  and also people hated Comcast so much. They rebranded their cable company

959
00:56:08,645 --> 00:56:09,805
Speaker 2:  to Xfinity. That's a real story.

960
00:56:11,315 --> 00:56:12,925
Speaker 2:  They don't like me very much. There's a disclosure

961
00:56:15,065 --> 00:56:19,045
Speaker 2:  and then Zav just zaz in his way. Yeah. To merging Warner Brothers and

962
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:22,765
Speaker 2:  Discovery. Right. The idea there was always scale, right? Yeah. Like the,

963
00:56:23,665 --> 00:56:27,485
Speaker 2:  the specific pitch for Warner Brothers discovery was we will have HBO

964
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:31,045
Speaker 2:  for your appointment Sunday night viewing. And then the rest of the time

965
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:34,205
Speaker 2:  when you're like, I don't know, what are those Property Brothers doing? You'll

966
00:56:34,205 --> 00:56:36,845
Speaker 2:  just like, turn that on and watch TikTok in the background. Right? Like and

967
00:56:36,845 --> 00:56:40,805
Speaker 2:  they explicitly made this, this is the idea. Like the bundle will be so big,

968
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,885
Speaker 2:  you'll subscribe to it, it'll be great for you,

969
00:56:43,945 --> 00:56:45,205
Speaker 5:  But bundles can get bigger

970
00:56:46,025 --> 00:56:48,085
Speaker 2:  And that's what the like this has run out.

971
00:56:48,435 --> 00:56:52,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Basically they need other content. Right? Like

972
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:56,765
Speaker 5:  it is unrealistic to expect people to only watch Netflix. It

973
00:56:56,765 --> 00:56:59,885
Speaker 5:  is unrealistic to expect people to only watch Disney Plus unless they're

974
00:57:00,165 --> 00:57:04,085
Speaker 5:  like under the age of five, in which case it's super realistic. But like,

975
00:57:04,425 --> 00:57:07,205
Speaker 2:  Did you see that set by the way? One out of three, one out of every three

976
00:57:07,205 --> 00:57:09,125
Speaker 2:  shows in Disney Plus is a Bluey stream. Yeah.

977
00:57:09,465 --> 00:57:11,005
Speaker 5:  Wow. Is it just Max? Just over

978
00:57:11,005 --> 00:57:14,965
Speaker 2:  And Wow. It's like 30% of all Disney plus streaming is bluey. That's insane.

979
00:57:15,355 --> 00:57:18,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Oh my gosh. It's like this company is extremely

980
00:57:19,205 --> 00:57:22,365
Speaker 2:  beholden to an Australian dog. Wow. I don't wanna talk about Blue at this

981
00:57:22,365 --> 00:57:22,485
Speaker 2:  time.

982
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:26,925
Speaker 2:  David, your kid isn't old enough to know, but when, when it comes time

983
00:57:28,015 --> 00:57:31,765
Speaker 2:  it'll be, it'll be very sad for you as well. But, so the bundles get bigger.

984
00:57:31,835 --> 00:57:33,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But why doesn't Netflix have this pressure?

985
00:57:34,315 --> 00:57:38,085
Speaker 5:  Because Netflix is huge. Like, like Netflix is, is bigger than

986
00:57:38,085 --> 00:57:40,645
Speaker 5:  kind of everybody else, right? Right. They have that first mover advantage.

987
00:57:40,745 --> 00:57:44,125
Speaker 5:  So they can just be, they're so far ahead of everybody else when it comes

988
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:47,325
Speaker 5:  to subscribers and stuff that they can just keep doing that and they can

989
00:57:47,325 --> 00:57:49,565
Speaker 5:  keep asking for more money. And also,

990
00:57:51,275 --> 00:57:55,205
Speaker 5:  this is the Alex who put them higher on the Go 90 scale than

991
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:58,725
Speaker 5:  some of the other people. They've got Hubris, right? Yeah. Like they, they,

992
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,765
Speaker 5:  they, they still haven't worked partnered with Apple. So, so you don't really

993
00:58:01,785 --> 00:58:05,765
Speaker 5:  get that. So that tight integration with like

994
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:08,805
Speaker 5:  the Apple products that you get with, with Disney Plus and Max and all these

995
00:58:08,805 --> 00:58:12,365
Speaker 5:  other ones, they don't partner with everybody else as often because they

996
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:16,085
Speaker 5:  are the biggest. And oftentimes when you do that,

997
00:58:16,085 --> 00:58:19,325
Speaker 5:  your hubris catches up with you eventually. So I like, I think it's a kind

998
00:58:19,325 --> 00:58:23,165
Speaker 5:  of a mistake for Netflix to not try to do this, but I'm not surprised

999
00:58:23,165 --> 00:58:26,165
Speaker 5:  by it because it's also the most, like, these are entertainment companies.

1000
00:58:26,275 --> 00:58:28,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Netflix is a technology company.

1001
00:58:28,825 --> 00:58:32,325
Speaker 2:  So you made a YouTube video this week. You basically, like the cable bundle

1002
00:58:32,505 --> 00:58:35,525
Speaker 2:  is back's and that's what's hap that's what's happening here, right? You

1003
00:58:35,525 --> 00:58:39,445
Speaker 2:  got Disney, the Hulu assets, they're gonna puts

1004
00:58:39,445 --> 00:58:41,765
Speaker 2:  ESPN plus in the Disney plus app. That's the cable bundle.

1005
00:58:41,795 --> 00:58:44,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You're, you're subsidizing all this stuff that you want that you don't

1006
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:46,965
Speaker 5:  necessarily want. 'cause I know you guys love sports,

1007
00:58:47,745 --> 00:58:49,845
Speaker 2:  But you have to, you are just SN will be here.

1008
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:52,445
Speaker 5:  I'm furious that I'm gonna have an ES, ESPN on my Disney Plus.

1009
00:58:52,515 --> 00:58:54,885
Speaker 2:  Well, and we don't know what the pricing will be. And then you get all the

1010
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:58,725
Speaker 2:  sort of Warner Brothers assets now too, plus HBO

1011
00:58:58,725 --> 00:59:01,645
Speaker 5:  Depending on what the price is, right? Like you could find, it could end

1012
00:59:01,645 --> 00:59:05,605
Speaker 5:  up being that the price is the exact same, only the only differences

1013
00:59:05,605 --> 00:59:07,485
Speaker 5:  that it's just more convenient to log in. Well,

1014
00:59:07,485 --> 00:59:11,445
Speaker 2:  So we do have this quote from Zaz. I'm, I'm

1015
00:59:11,445 --> 00:59:12,325
Speaker 2:  just so worried about

1016
00:59:12,865 --> 00:59:15,965
Speaker 5:  Zdi. There we go. Sorry, I had to do it.

1017
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:17,925
Speaker 2:  I'm so tired.

1018
00:59:19,595 --> 00:59:19,885
Speaker 2:  It's

1019
00:59:20,385 --> 00:59:23,245
Speaker 5:  If you ever that man, like, I can't, I just walk

1020
00:59:23,245 --> 00:59:26,605
Speaker 2:  Away. I I won't let you as, as somebody who's responsible for this newsroom

1021
00:59:27,225 --> 00:59:28,045
Speaker 2:  and your friend.

1022
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:30,445
Speaker 5:  He was like, no, we can't go that way.

1023
00:59:30,955 --> 00:59:34,405
Speaker 2:  Just can you imagine having to work with somebody every day who's

1024
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:35,205
Speaker 2:  horny for David?

1025
00:59:37,025 --> 00:59:40,525
Speaker 2:  That's what it's like here at The. Verge. All right. Here's the quote from,

1026
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:40,965
Speaker 2:  from,

1027
00:59:44,515 --> 00:59:46,965
Speaker 2:  It's like the New York Times is like dealing with Kevin Roos being like,

1028
00:59:47,005 --> 00:59:50,925
Speaker 2:  I banged 18 robots on ai and we had Alex. I'm just

1029
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:53,525
Speaker 2:  like, Eile very different. Loves it. by the way, you should read the Kevin

1030
00:59:53,725 --> 00:59:57,605
Speaker 2:  Roo article where he did make friends with 18. It's very different AI personalities.

1031
00:59:57,945 --> 01:00:01,845
Speaker 2:  And even from the jump he is like, it's a little horny. He's like,

1032
01:00:02,995 --> 01:00:06,965
Speaker 2:  it's good. Anyway, here's a quote from David Zav. There's

1033
01:00:06,965 --> 01:00:10,445
Speaker 2:  a lot of irrationality in the market that's getting shaken out in terms of

1034
01:00:10,445 --> 01:00:13,805
Speaker 2:  money spent. Ultimately, I think the business will look very different in

1035
01:00:13,805 --> 01:00:16,765
Speaker 2:  two to three years. It will be much better for consumers.

1036
01:00:18,845 --> 01:00:20,165
Speaker 2:  A lot of ideas in that quote. Yeah.

1037
01:00:20,245 --> 01:00:23,045
Speaker 5:  I like, basically they're just bringing TV back.

1038
01:00:24,665 --> 01:00:28,525
Speaker 5:  And, and in a lot of ways TV is quite convenient. Yeah. People loved it

1039
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:32,165
Speaker 5:  for 50, 60 years. It, it, it worked and, and then everybody was like, we're

1040
01:00:32,165 --> 01:00:35,605
Speaker 5:  tired of all the ads and everything else. And that's why we got streaming

1041
01:00:35,605 --> 01:00:38,925
Speaker 5:  to begin with. And that's just what he's doing. Like I think he's very right

1042
01:00:38,925 --> 01:00:42,285
Speaker 5:  in that there are a lot of bad ideas and they are being shake, shaken out.

1043
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:45,965
Speaker 5:  That's why everybody's going to advertising. That's why everybody is bundling.

1044
01:00:45,965 --> 01:00:48,885
Speaker 5:  That's why everybody is subsidizing sports and, and all of this other stuff.

1045
01:00:49,465 --> 01:00:53,285
Speaker 5:  But I don't know if it'll be better for consumers in 3D

1046
01:00:53,365 --> 01:00:53,525
Speaker 5:  years.

1047
01:00:54,245 --> 01:00:58,005
Speaker 6:  I think the, the one other thing that's worth mentioning here is it's, it's

1048
01:00:58,005 --> 01:01:01,525
Speaker 6:  very telling to me that what he says is in terms of the amount of money spent.

1049
01:01:01,675 --> 01:01:04,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And I think If, you wanna talk about what's different about Netflix

1050
01:01:04,705 --> 01:01:08,445
Speaker 6:  versus these other companies is Netflix can afford to

1051
01:01:08,495 --> 01:01:12,125
Speaker 6:  exist. Whereas you have Disney, which spent way too much

1052
01:01:12,365 --> 01:01:16,325
Speaker 6:  money to acquire Fox. You have Warner Brothers discovery, which

1053
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:20,205
Speaker 6:  took on a massive quantity of debt in order to become the company that

1054
01:01:20,205 --> 01:01:24,165
Speaker 6:  it is. These companies literally cannot afford to exist in

1055
01:01:24,165 --> 01:01:26,845
Speaker 6:  the way that they currently work. Whereas Netflix, I think it was in

1056
01:01:26,845 --> 01:01:30,765
Speaker 6:  20 21, 20 20 or 2021, announced basically

1057
01:01:30,765 --> 01:01:33,685
Speaker 6:  like, we're good. We have enough money now that we don't have to take external

1058
01:01:33,685 --> 01:01:37,325
Speaker 6:  financing. And that puts you in such an unbelievable position of power

1059
01:01:37,905 --> 01:01:41,605
Speaker 6:  to be able to just do whatever you want because you can afford your business.

1060
01:01:41,945 --> 01:01:45,765
Speaker 6:  And what no one else has proven other than Netflix is that this is a business

1061
01:01:45,765 --> 01:01:46,525
Speaker 6:  that you can afford

1062
01:01:47,425 --> 01:01:50,845
Speaker 2:  Or it has the margins that you grow. Right? Like Netflix is

1063
01:01:52,445 --> 01:01:55,085
Speaker 2:  actually, maybe the easiest way to talk about this is the Go 90 scale of

1064
01:01:55,085 --> 01:01:58,485
Speaker 2:  Doom streaming services. So Netflix to me, I know Alex,

1065
01:01:58,945 --> 01:02:00,365
Speaker 5:  I'm on the other side, but I get it

1066
01:02:00,365 --> 01:02:03,605
Speaker 2:  Completely thinks Netflix will fail. But by the way, disclosure are produce

1067
01:02:03,605 --> 01:02:05,485
Speaker 2:  Netflix show. It's called The Future of It's very good. Yeah.

1068
01:02:05,705 --> 01:02:07,965
Speaker 5:  Likely Story support 'em. Huh?

1069
01:02:08,595 --> 01:02:11,205
Speaker 2:  They really did rebranded Xfinity. 'cause everyone hated the Comcast brand.

1070
01:02:11,225 --> 01:02:15,205
Speaker 2:  So that is a true story. I heard it again recently. I put Netflix

1071
01:02:15,345 --> 01:02:19,085
Speaker 2:  at zero by the way. The Go 90 Scale If, you remember Go 90. It's Verizon's

1072
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:22,285
Speaker 2:  failed streaming service where they thought children would join quote gangs.

1073
01:02:23,185 --> 01:02:25,605
Speaker 2:  No, it's a cruise. It was something they thought the kids would rotate their

1074
01:02:25,605 --> 01:02:29,005
Speaker 2:  phones 90 degrees to watch YouTube and they had no idea why anyone was watching

1075
01:02:29,005 --> 01:02:30,045
Speaker 2:  YouTube. And it immediately failed

1076
01:02:30,285 --> 01:02:31,045
Speaker 5:  Quibi. Before Quibi.

1077
01:02:31,065 --> 01:02:31,685
Speaker 2:  It was a lot.

1078
01:02:33,425 --> 01:02:37,405
Speaker 2:  Now to go, 90 means to die. This is ver has

1079
01:02:37,435 --> 01:02:40,805
Speaker 2:  lore if you're unfamiliar, so the Go 90 scale is driven streaming services

1080
01:02:40,805 --> 01:02:44,725
Speaker 2:  from zero to 90. You put them on a scale, zero is alive. 90

1081
01:02:44,755 --> 01:02:48,645
Speaker 2:  said Netflix in my mind is zero right now. It is

1082
01:02:48,645 --> 01:02:51,045
Speaker 2:  the one you don't quit. No one turns off a Netflix right

1083
01:02:51,045 --> 01:02:53,285
Speaker 5:  Now. It is a hundred percent zero. I would, I would agree with you there.

1084
01:02:53,925 --> 01:02:57,405
Speaker 6:  I will say Alex said it was a 40 at South by Southwest. Yes.

1085
01:02:58,105 --> 01:03:01,885
Speaker 5:  Few months ago. It's a 40 in my heart. And in the future it's zero.

1086
01:03:01,975 --> 01:03:02,325
Speaker 5:  Right.

1087
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:04,925
Speaker 2:  Today because you think the hubris makes them brittle. I I understand the

1088
01:03:05,005 --> 01:03:08,405
Speaker 2:  argument. Yeah. But I just don't, I think Netflix is very good at

1089
01:03:08,405 --> 01:03:11,925
Speaker 2:  programming. Its service. Exactly. To make you never churn. They're like,

1090
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:14,765
Speaker 2:  here's one more John Malaney special, like Bridger

1091
01:03:14,765 --> 01:03:15,605
Speaker 5:  Bridger's coming, man,

1092
01:03:15,745 --> 01:03:18,245
Speaker 2:  I'm so excited. It's just always, they're always doing that thing. Yeah.

1093
01:03:18,245 --> 01:03:20,885
Speaker 2:  You're like ready to quit and they got one more thing for you. Good. They

1094
01:03:20,885 --> 01:03:21,885
Speaker 2:  figured it out. Data,

1095
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:27,165
Speaker 2:  HBO or now Max, whatever the hell it's called,

1096
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:30,925
Speaker 2:  like Max is 45.

1097
01:03:32,715 --> 01:03:36,685
Speaker 2:  Like there it, it is, they're gonna, they hit a

1098
01:03:36,685 --> 01:03:39,965
Speaker 2:  hundred million subscribers globally, but they're about to hike prices again

1099
01:03:39,965 --> 01:03:43,245
Speaker 2:  because of what David is saying, they cannot afford to run this business.

1100
01:03:43,915 --> 01:03:47,245
Speaker 2:  It's programming is all over the place. Right. They have

1101
01:03:47,655 --> 01:03:51,525
Speaker 2:  HBO's programming, but HBO's in one of, its sort of like consistent sort

1102
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:54,805
Speaker 2:  of like dry spells. I'm sure there'll be more stuff coming back, but

1103
01:03:55,505 --> 01:03:57,965
Speaker 2:  that's the history of HBO. It runs hot, then it runs cold.

1104
01:03:59,895 --> 01:04:02,445
Speaker 2:  There isn't some like consistent slate of programming. Yes.

1105
01:04:02,445 --> 01:04:05,485
Speaker 5:  There is those Property Brothers, people love.

1106
01:04:05,485 --> 01:04:08,125
Speaker 2:  Well there's that stuff, but there isn't like the, I mean that

1107
01:04:08,155 --> 01:04:11,205
Speaker 5:  Like we can't ignore it. It's something that maybe we don't talk about like

1108
01:04:11,605 --> 01:04:15,325
Speaker 5:  critically and you don't see people talking about it on threads and, and

1109
01:04:15,325 --> 01:04:18,245
Speaker 5:  social media and stuff. But that is a big part of their business. That's

1110
01:04:18,665 --> 01:04:22,485
Speaker 5:  why LOV could afford to buy Warner Brothers is because of how

1111
01:04:22,485 --> 01:04:25,005
Speaker 5:  big that business is for 'em. And I don't, that's not going away anytime

1112
01:04:25,005 --> 01:04:25,525
Speaker 5:  soon. He's really,

1113
01:04:25,585 --> 01:04:27,125
Speaker 2:  But that's the discovery business. That's the

1114
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:29,405
Speaker 5:  Discovery business that's now in Max.

1115
01:04:29,835 --> 01:04:33,685
Speaker 2:  Sure. Okay. I'm just saying 45. Yeah, I know. 'cause you're not

1116
01:04:33,685 --> 01:04:36,765
Speaker 2:  running around trying to make a deal with Disney If, you think you're more

1117
01:04:36,775 --> 01:04:39,245
Speaker 2:  alive than dead. Yeah. Is just my belief.

1118
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:42,765
Speaker 6:  Well, and this is why the sports race is so intense right now because I think

1119
01:04:42,825 --> 01:04:46,365
Speaker 6:  the, the property brothers will keep people subscribed to you. They're not

1120
01:04:46,365 --> 01:04:50,165
Speaker 6:  going to win you vast tens of millions of new

1121
01:04:50,405 --> 01:04:50,685
Speaker 6:  subscribers.

1122
01:04:50,825 --> 01:04:54,805
Speaker 5:  But I also wanna be wary of saying that this deal is an indication

1123
01:04:54,805 --> 01:04:58,085
Speaker 5:  that Disney and Max are struggling. Because I don't think, like, I think

1124
01:04:58,085 --> 01:05:01,965
Speaker 5:  this is as much about dealing with the fact that these are highly vertically

1125
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:05,605
Speaker 5:  integrated companies and there's currently a government that doesn't like

1126
01:05:05,845 --> 01:05:09,085
Speaker 5:  that. And, and it's really useful to be like, no, we're partnering together.

1127
01:05:09,185 --> 01:05:09,405
Speaker 5:  You

1128
01:05:09,465 --> 01:05:13,365
Speaker 2:  You think that in the absence of Lena Kahn, Disney would buy Warner

1129
01:05:13,365 --> 01:05:14,005
Speaker 2:  Brothers discovery

1130
01:05:15,025 --> 01:05:18,725
Speaker 5:  If, if Lena Khan got sucked up by aliens

1131
01:05:18,925 --> 01:05:19,645
Speaker 5:  tomorrow and

1132
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:20,645
Speaker 2:  If Trump gets elected.

1133
01:05:20,755 --> 01:05:24,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And, and they managed to sell E-E-S-P-N so they can make all their

1134
01:05:24,485 --> 01:05:26,045
Speaker 5:  money. They would buy it in a heartbeat

1135
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:30,405
Speaker 6:  No chance. No. With what money. I said

1136
01:05:30,605 --> 01:05:33,645
Speaker 5:  I I had to, I that's why I put all those, those clarifiers on there. Right.

1137
01:05:34,095 --> 01:05:37,685
Speaker 6:  Let's, let's add your debt to our debt and we'll give you 50 bucks and then

1138
01:05:37,685 --> 01:05:38,685
Speaker 6:  we'll all slowly die

1139
01:05:38,845 --> 01:05:41,045
Speaker 2:  Together. Wait, actually David, when you describe it like that, that does

1140
01:05:41,045 --> 01:05:42,205
Speaker 2:  sound like the media business.

1141
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:43,005
Speaker 5:  That is,

1142
01:05:44,355 --> 01:05:48,085
Speaker 2:  That does, that's how it works. In fact, sound how these CEOs think. That

1143
01:05:48,085 --> 01:05:50,605
Speaker 2:  is basically fair. Let's let's lay off 10,000 people and have a bunch of

1144
01:05:50,605 --> 01:05:54,445
Speaker 2:  debt. Somehow we will get boats. And is Zach Snyder

1145
01:05:54,445 --> 01:05:57,685
Speaker 2:  available? Because we have a number of movies. We recut is Grayscale Squares.

1146
01:05:57,685 --> 01:06:01,525
Speaker 5:  Hollywood is built on debt there. They this way financing has worked in

1147
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:05,245
Speaker 5:  Hollywood from the beginning is is on debt. Nothing is ever made with like

1148
01:06:05,245 --> 01:06:08,285
Speaker 5:  the cash they have in house. Yeah. It's made with the future.

1149
01:06:08,285 --> 01:06:11,045
Speaker 2:  Usually the assumption has been that the property will make money. Yeah.

1150
01:06:13,685 --> 01:06:17,565
Speaker 2:  A pro a problem that they're having anyway. Well, they'll be

1151
01:06:17,565 --> 01:06:21,325
Speaker 2:  fine. Okay, so I'm putting Max at 45. I'm putting Disney

1152
01:06:21,945 --> 01:06:25,925
Speaker 2:  Disney plus at 45. That's, that's, that's my go 90

1153
01:06:26,135 --> 01:06:29,005
Speaker 2:  scale. I I think these things are are wobbly in the middle right now?

1154
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:33,485
Speaker 5:  No. Disney Disney is massive and, and like streaming is a big part

1155
01:06:33,485 --> 01:06:36,845
Speaker 5:  of Disney's business. Streaming is not all of Disney's business of all of

1156
01:06:36,845 --> 01:06:40,525
Speaker 5:  these companies. It is super positioned because it's got a ton

1157
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:42,765
Speaker 5:  of very lucrative theme parks

1158
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:45,645
Speaker 2:  Throughout the world. I just want to point out that technically the Max app

1159
01:06:45,665 --> 01:06:49,525
Speaker 2:  has already gone 90 several times as it has rebranded from

1160
01:06:49,525 --> 01:06:50,925
Speaker 2:  HBO to HBO Max to Max every

1161
01:06:50,925 --> 01:06:52,045
Speaker 5:  Other month. It goes

1162
01:06:52,045 --> 01:06:54,725
Speaker 2:  90. Like it's go it keeps going away in some way. Yeah.

1163
01:06:54,795 --> 01:06:58,645
Speaker 6:  Well I think the, this, this all sort of revolves around Netflix in a funny

1164
01:06:58,705 --> 01:07:02,605
Speaker 6:  way, which is why Netflix is so powerful in all this. Because I

1165
01:07:02,605 --> 01:07:06,565
Speaker 6:  think the, the case for Disney Plus going away is that Disney decides that

1166
01:07:07,005 --> 01:07:10,845
Speaker 6:  actually if we want our theme parks to succeed, the best way for us

1167
01:07:10,865 --> 01:07:14,805
Speaker 6:  to do that is to sell shows to Netflix and not put them on Disney Plus, which

1168
01:07:14,845 --> 01:07:18,765
Speaker 6:  I think is a not crazy Yeah. Conclusion to draw in a couple of years.

1169
01:07:18,765 --> 01:07:22,565
Speaker 6:  You're gonna decide it is so expensive and so wasteful for us to

1170
01:07:22,565 --> 01:07:26,485
Speaker 6:  run our own service. What we actually need is for people to watch our stuff.

1171
01:07:26,705 --> 01:07:29,525
Speaker 6:  And the way to do that is to put it in movie theaters and put it on Netflix.

1172
01:07:30,025 --> 01:07:32,405
Speaker 6:  And I think it's possible that that is where this goes.

1173
01:07:32,705 --> 01:07:36,605
Speaker 2:  We come back to this at the end of the summer if and when we

1174
01:07:36,605 --> 01:07:40,365
Speaker 2:  find out there whether or not there will be more bluey episodes because

1175
01:07:40,715 --> 01:07:44,045
Speaker 2:  it's honestly depending on that answer,

1176
01:07:45,345 --> 01:07:49,205
Speaker 2:  Disney Plus goes in one of two directions. If If, you just look at the scale

1177
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:53,165
Speaker 2:  of how much that business is currently dependent on Bluey it, it's not

1178
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:57,205
Speaker 2:  dependent on whatever horrible garbage Max watches otherwise. So

1179
01:07:58,075 --> 01:08:01,485
Speaker 2:  there's a show about the, the children of the villains. It's bad. All the

1180
01:08:01,485 --> 01:08:02,085
Speaker 2:  descendants.

1181
01:08:02,465 --> 01:08:03,085
Speaker 5:  Why do I know that?

1182
01:08:03,155 --> 01:08:05,005
Speaker 2:  I've never seen anything worse in my entire life.

1183
01:08:05,675 --> 01:08:06,525
Speaker 5:  I've never watched it.

1184
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:09,325
Speaker 2:  It's fine. It's like very safe If. you have a 6-year-old girl, you're like,

1185
01:08:09,325 --> 01:08:12,045
Speaker 2:  watch this garbage. It's better than what's on YouTube kids.

1186
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:16,725
Speaker 2:  But I'm saying depending on how Bluey goes, I I we should come back to that

1187
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:19,525
Speaker 2:  conversation. Okay. We should take a break. I will call out by the way that

1188
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:23,405
Speaker 2:  Sony is in the middle of discussions to buy Paramount.

1189
01:08:23,585 --> 01:08:26,365
Speaker 5:  Oh, I hope not. 'cause it's with Apollo management, right? Yeah.

1190
01:08:26,365 --> 01:08:28,485
Speaker 2:  That that's just layoff city. That's what's gonna happen. Yeah. That, that's

1191
01:08:28,545 --> 01:08:31,125
Speaker 2:  the, all the headlines about Sony and Paramount should be like Sony discusses

1192
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:32,445
Speaker 2:  laying off Paramount's employees,

1193
01:08:32,785 --> 01:08:36,125
Speaker 5:  But they're still also in talks with Skydance, which is owned by Larry Ellison's

1194
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:39,885
Speaker 5:  son from Oracle. Yeah. And that could still happen. That's the one I'm

1195
01:08:39,885 --> 01:08:43,485
Speaker 5:  mainly rooting for because I hate watching companies be bought up

1196
01:08:43,785 --> 01:08:44,765
Speaker 5:  and broken apart.

1197
01:08:45,185 --> 01:08:46,205
Speaker 2:  You love CBS

1198
01:08:46,595 --> 01:08:50,005
Speaker 5:  Also. I love, I I'm, I is it really because I'm concerned about Star Trek?

1199
01:08:50,525 --> 01:08:50,685
Speaker 5:  Yes.

1200
01:08:51,395 --> 01:08:54,805
Speaker 6:  There's a very good episode by the way of the Town podcast where they talk

1201
01:08:54,805 --> 01:08:58,125
Speaker 6:  about this and basically land on If. you want good content

1202
01:08:58,915 --> 01:09:02,485
Speaker 6:  root for the Skydance deal. If, you want a bunch of Paramount

1203
01:09:02,485 --> 01:09:06,125
Speaker 6:  shareholders to make money and then all of this to go away. You should root

1204
01:09:06,125 --> 01:09:07,525
Speaker 6:  for Sony and Apollo.

1205
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:08,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1206
01:09:08,425 --> 01:09:11,605
Speaker 6:  I'm like slightly simplifying but not that much. Yeah,

1207
01:09:11,995 --> 01:09:14,965
Speaker 5:  It's, that's that's act that's a hundred percent correct. If. you want Star

1208
01:09:15,085 --> 01:09:18,845
Speaker 5:  Trek root for Skydance If. you don't care about Star Trek

1209
01:09:18,865 --> 01:09:22,765
Speaker 5:  and Taylor Sheridan's ranches root for Apollo

1210
01:09:22,765 --> 01:09:23,525
Speaker 5:  and Sony. Wait,

1211
01:09:23,605 --> 01:09:26,285
Speaker 2:  I I that's a, that's a bad mix of things to care about.

1212
01:09:27,745 --> 01:09:28,925
Speaker 2:  How do I get one but not the other?

1213
01:09:30,435 --> 01:09:33,165
Speaker 2:  Okay. We gotta take a break. We're gonna come back with the lightning round,

1214
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:36,645
Speaker 2:  which is actually has to be lightning 'cause we are so over today,

1215
01:09:37,785 --> 01:09:40,085
Speaker 2:  but it's gonna be really long. We'll be right back with the front chest.

1216
01:09:43,075 --> 01:09:47,045
Speaker 12:  Once upon a time in America there was no such thing as all you can

1217
01:09:47,045 --> 01:09:50,165
Speaker 12:  eat shrimp. And then the world changed. Today

1218
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:53,965
Speaker 13:  Shrimp is the most popular, the most consumed seafood in

1219
01:09:53,965 --> 01:09:57,365
Speaker 13:  America. The endless Shrimp Fiesta is an American

1220
01:09:57,675 --> 01:09:58,365
Speaker 13:  institution,

1221
01:09:58,545 --> 01:10:02,405
Speaker 12:  But that Shrimp Fiesta comes at a steep price. Here at Gastropod,

1222
01:10:02,425 --> 01:10:06,125
Speaker 12:  we found out that hidden behind the delicious shrimp on your plate is

1223
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:08,405
Speaker 12:  environmental disaster and modern day slavery.

1224
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:12,685
Speaker 13:  So can you have your shrimp and a clear conscience too actually

1225
01:10:12,945 --> 01:10:16,325
Speaker 13:  Yes. And we've got the secret to help you unlock true

1226
01:10:16,965 --> 01:10:20,805
Speaker 13:  lifelong shrimp happiness. Listen to the latest episode of Gastropod

1227
01:10:21,245 --> 01:10:22,525
Speaker 13:  wherever you get your podcasts.

1228
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:30,845
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. It's the lightning round, which really for me is what

1229
01:10:30,845 --> 01:10:33,965
Speaker 2:  I have taken to calling the victory lap round. But let's begin with Alex.

1230
01:10:34,715 --> 01:10:36,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Not a victory lap.

1231
01:10:37,155 --> 01:10:37,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. This is sad

1232
01:10:37,865 --> 01:10:41,805
Speaker 5:  For, for mine. Yeah. No, this is a bummer. Microsoft is currently going

1233
01:10:41,805 --> 01:10:45,245
Speaker 5:  through it. Tom Warren had a really great piece up this week and Ash Paris,

1234
01:10:45,345 --> 01:10:48,405
Speaker 5:  our game reporter, had a really cool follow piece on it.

1235
01:10:49,675 --> 01:10:52,845
Speaker 5:  They, they've been closing studios, they've been laying people off. They

1236
01:10:52,845 --> 01:10:56,685
Speaker 5:  they had to bake all hands after they, they closed this one studio that

1237
01:10:56,685 --> 01:11:00,005
Speaker 5:  made this really popular game last year called Hi Fi Rush If. you haven't

1238
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:03,845
Speaker 5:  heard about it. That's because you don't play video games enough. Hi-Fi Rush

1239
01:11:03,865 --> 01:11:07,485
Speaker 5:  was like a big indie darling and it was widely well

1240
01:11:07,725 --> 01:11:10,925
Speaker 5:  received. It did really, really well for them. And then they said

1241
01:11:11,755 --> 01:11:14,490
Speaker 5:  they laid off every, they they like closed the studio. Yeah. They laid everybody

1242
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:16,805
Speaker 5:  off and, and they were like, yeah, we need to make more games like that.

1243
01:11:16,825 --> 01:11:17,525
Speaker 5:  And it's like, well

1244
01:11:19,095 --> 01:11:23,005
Speaker 5:  maybe. Hmm. And so there's just a lot of chaos over there and, and I

1245
01:11:23,005 --> 01:11:25,125
Speaker 5:  think it's the same thing we're seeing, you know, we've talked a lot about

1246
01:11:25,325 --> 01:11:29,085
Speaker 5:  creatives in this episode. It's that same anxiety. It's the, the same issues

1247
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:32,805
Speaker 5:  that we're seeing with streaming where these people have spent a lot of money

1248
01:11:33,225 --> 01:11:36,885
Speaker 5:  on acquisitions and growing during the 0% interest rate days

1249
01:11:37,465 --> 01:11:39,365
Speaker 5:  and they, they grew a whole lot and

1250
01:11:41,195 --> 01:11:41,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

1251
01:11:41,665 --> 01:11:45,485
Speaker 5:  You can't grow in like infinite content has to have infinite

1252
01:11:45,485 --> 01:11:46,965
Speaker 5:  people watching it and paying for it.

1253
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:51,285
Speaker 5:  We don't do that in this human life.

1254
01:11:51,865 --> 01:11:55,445
Speaker 6:  It is a remarkably similar trajectory. Yeah. Like

1255
01:11:55,845 --> 01:11:59,565
Speaker 6:  Microsoft saying, okay, we, we think this is gonna move

1256
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:03,165
Speaker 6:  from a AYA thing model to a subscription model. Thus

1257
01:12:03,345 --> 01:12:06,885
Speaker 6:  we need a lot of content. Oh God, we need a lot of exclusive content to

1258
01:12:07,595 --> 01:12:11,245
Speaker 6:  okay, maybe actually there aren't as many people who want to

1259
01:12:11,465 --> 01:12:15,365
Speaker 6:  pay for all of this, especially given what it costs because all this stuff

1260
01:12:15,365 --> 01:12:19,325
Speaker 6:  is expensive. Bail, bale, bale, bale, bale. And then so you, you go

1261
01:12:19,325 --> 01:12:22,165
Speaker 6:  from like, we have to grow to the size of the universe in order for this

1262
01:12:22,165 --> 01:12:24,165
Speaker 6:  thing to work. And then you realize, oh, it's actually not possible for us

1263
01:12:24,165 --> 01:12:26,725
Speaker 6:  to grow to the size of the universe in the same way that everybody thought

1264
01:12:26,725 --> 01:12:30,245
Speaker 6:  they were gonna get a billion subscribers to streaming services. Like no,

1265
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:33,245
Speaker 6:  it turns out there is kind of a local maximum to that and

1266
01:12:34,065 --> 01:12:34,485
Speaker 6:  people

1267
01:12:34,505 --> 01:12:35,765
Speaker 5:  Are finite unfortunately.

1268
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:38,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And, and it turns out I think Microsoft is going through the same thing

1269
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:41,645
Speaker 6:  now where it's like, okay, we, if we build this unbelievable war chest of

1270
01:12:41,645 --> 01:12:44,325
Speaker 6:  content and people and talent, it will

1271
01:12:45,635 --> 01:12:49,405
Speaker 6:  work. And then all of a sudden everybody's like, oh, that's not a plan. That's

1272
01:12:49,405 --> 01:12:52,925
Speaker 6:  nothing. Yeah. And it all just kind of collapses. And it's really sad because

1273
01:12:52,955 --> 01:12:56,765
Speaker 6:  it's happening at like unbelievable scale and pace right now.

1274
01:12:56,985 --> 01:13:00,365
Speaker 5:  And it's also in an industry that I think was already unsustainable to begin

1275
01:13:00,365 --> 01:13:03,085
Speaker 5:  with, with Crunch and everything like that. Like this was an industry that's

1276
01:13:03,085 --> 01:13:07,045
Speaker 5:  been creaking for a decade and, and I it's it's having

1277
01:13:07,245 --> 01:13:10,805
Speaker 5:  a massive moment and I, it sucks for all the people involved, but like

1278
01:13:11,995 --> 01:13:13,005
Speaker 5:  it's happening. Yeah.

1279
01:13:13,445 --> 01:13:17,285
Speaker 2:  I just wanna point out that Microsoft fought tooth and nail to buy Activision.

1280
01:13:17,315 --> 01:13:20,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And they were like, this will grow our business. This is the thing.

1281
01:13:20,665 --> 01:13:24,405
Speaker 2:  And really the question we should ask with all of these deals, how many people

1282
01:13:24,405 --> 01:13:28,165
Speaker 2:  are you gonna lay off? How many is it? It's always some,

1283
01:13:28,585 --> 01:13:32,365
Speaker 6:  Wasn't it T-Mobile that said in buying Sprint that it thought the number

1284
01:13:32,365 --> 01:13:35,525
Speaker 6:  of jobs were gonna go up and everybody's like, ah, sick. And then they immediately

1285
01:13:35,525 --> 01:13:36,645
Speaker 6:  let off thousands people immediately.

1286
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:36,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1287
01:13:36,925 --> 01:13:38,405
Speaker 5:  Like that's not true. It's never true.

1288
01:13:38,585 --> 01:13:42,205
Speaker 2:  And I, it just like, it's the thing like you combine two companies,

1289
01:13:42,535 --> 01:13:46,245
Speaker 2:  there are gonna be a lot, there's gonna be overlap. It's, it's gonna happen.

1290
01:13:46,485 --> 01:13:49,765
Speaker 2:  I I interview a lot of executives, you can just see the wheels turning,

1291
01:13:50,425 --> 01:13:53,685
Speaker 2:  boy, I don't need double the back office staff. Like whatever. You can just,

1292
01:13:53,865 --> 01:13:56,005
Speaker 2:  and they call it efficiencies and it's really layoffs and that's just like

1293
01:13:56,005 --> 01:13:59,645
Speaker 2:  how it goes. And then on top of it, Microsoft was

1294
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:03,445
Speaker 2:  insistent that it needed to buy Activision because it was winning

1295
01:14:03,655 --> 01:14:07,125
Speaker 2:  while Microsoft was losing and they bought Activision and they're like, look

1296
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:10,965
Speaker 2:  at all these losers. And it's like, we, we

1297
01:14:11,045 --> 01:14:13,125
Speaker 2:  should start asking the questions ahead. How many people are you gonna lay

1298
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:16,765
Speaker 2:  off? That's the only question, right? Like that is the policy

1299
01:14:16,765 --> 01:14:20,525
Speaker 2:  consequence of allowing these mergers at scale. Like really truly on the

1300
01:14:20,525 --> 01:14:24,125
Speaker 2:  ground, a bunch of people are gonna lose their jobs. How many is it?

1301
01:14:24,465 --> 01:14:26,965
Speaker 2:  And if, if they're not willing to answer that question, I honestly think

1302
01:14:26,965 --> 01:14:29,885
Speaker 2:  like Yeah. Don't, we should no longer give any of these companies a benefit

1303
01:14:29,905 --> 01:14:30,165
Speaker 2:  of the

1304
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,605
Speaker 6:  Doubt. Yeah. You don't get to just buy

1305
01:14:31,605 --> 01:14:32,365
Speaker 2:  It. Yeah.

1306
01:14:34,205 --> 01:14:38,085
Speaker 2:  I would point out that at and t buying Time Warner did allow Zach Snyder

1307
01:14:38,085 --> 01:14:41,325
Speaker 2:  to employ a number of people to make a four three gray scale Batman movie.

1308
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:41,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1309
01:14:42,315 --> 01:14:45,285
Speaker 6:  Nila, do you get a cut of sales of this movie? Like what, what we, what is

1310
01:14:45,285 --> 01:14:49,085
Speaker 6:  happening? We've officially tipped from like, this is funny to like what's

1311
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:49,925
Speaker 6:  NE's angle here?

1312
01:14:50,205 --> 01:14:53,165
Speaker 2:  I just, I just wanna, I want to hammer it home for people

1313
01:14:53,955 --> 01:14:57,325
Speaker 2:  that the Trump administration getting rid of net neutrality

1314
01:14:58,075 --> 01:15:01,925
Speaker 2:  allowed at t to by the Time Warner and now there is a Gray Scout Batman

1315
01:15:01,925 --> 01:15:05,525
Speaker 2:  movie and that is a direct line of events by the way. Net neutrality did

1316
01:15:05,525 --> 01:15:08,605
Speaker 2:  pass. They got rid of the weird rule that would've allowed for 5G fat lane

1317
01:15:08,605 --> 01:15:12,085
Speaker 2:  pass lanes. We now live in a world of not child again. It's great. Sorry

1318
01:15:12,155 --> 01:15:16,125
Speaker 2:  Zach. Alright. Victory lap one complete victory lap

1319
01:15:16,185 --> 01:15:16,845
Speaker 2:  two for me.

1320
01:15:20,395 --> 01:15:23,885
Speaker 2:  This is, this is the whole lightning round just ne I was right about,

1321
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:25,565
Speaker 2:  I'm sorry.

1322
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:30,725
Speaker 2:  You'll recall that Epic Games sued Apple for

1323
01:15:30,725 --> 01:15:34,605
Speaker 2:  antitrust violations long ago. They mostly lost that case.

1324
01:15:35,195 --> 01:15:38,365
Speaker 2:  They did. They they mostly lost that case. I would say they, they might have

1325
01:15:38,365 --> 01:15:42,285
Speaker 2:  set the stage for the current DOJ case for other cases or they, they

1326
01:15:42,285 --> 01:15:44,445
Speaker 2:  made a bunch of arguments that are now being made again by the government

1327
01:15:44,445 --> 01:15:47,165
Speaker 2:  in different ways. They got a ball rolling, very much got a ball rolling.

1328
01:15:47,305 --> 01:15:49,765
Speaker 2:  The one thing they wanted in that case was

1329
01:15:51,425 --> 01:15:55,405
Speaker 2:  the judge applying California law because I think the judge

1330
01:15:55,465 --> 01:15:59,205
Speaker 2:  was unwilling to rewrite United States federal antitrust law. But the judge

1331
01:15:59,315 --> 01:16:03,125
Speaker 2:  interpreted California law to say Apple could no longer

1332
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:07,085
Speaker 2:  prevent app developers from what's called steering. So Apple

1333
01:16:07,105 --> 01:16:09,685
Speaker 2:  has these things called anti steering rules where you are not even allowed

1334
01:16:09,685 --> 01:16:12,685
Speaker 2:  to mention that there's another website where you could buy stuff.

1335
01:16:13,755 --> 01:16:17,485
Speaker 2:  Anti steering rules struck down. I have the

1336
01:16:17,645 --> 01:16:21,325
Speaker 2:  specific quote here. Apple is permanently restrained and enjoyed from

1337
01:16:21,485 --> 01:16:24,205
Speaker 2:  prohibiting developers from including in their apps and their metadata buttons,

1338
01:16:24,365 --> 01:16:27,285
Speaker 2:  external links or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing

1339
01:16:27,285 --> 01:16:31,085
Speaker 2:  mechanisms in addition to the app store. That's the rule.

1340
01:16:31,575 --> 01:16:32,525
Speaker 2:  Judge passes this rule

1341
01:16:32,585 --> 01:16:36,245
Speaker 6:  And Apple's response was to allow a app or a link rather.

1342
01:16:36,935 --> 01:16:40,645
Speaker 2:  Right? So the rule comes out and I wrote a piece

1343
01:16:40,995 --> 01:16:44,685
Speaker 2:  back then 2021 saying Apple's about to end up in a fight

1344
01:16:44,715 --> 01:16:48,645
Speaker 2:  over buttons and links like they're not allowed to prevent buttons and

1345
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:52,085
Speaker 2:  links from going to external purchasing me mechanisms. When

1346
01:16:52,225 --> 01:16:56,125
Speaker 2:  courts write two nouns, they often mean

1347
01:16:56,425 --> 01:17:00,325
Speaker 2:  for the nouns to mean different things. So now you have buttons and you have

1348
01:17:00,335 --> 01:17:04,285
Speaker 2:  links that, that they necessarily mean different things. This

1349
01:17:04,285 --> 01:17:08,165
Speaker 2:  is just legal interpretation 1 0 1. I would say the

1350
01:17:08,275 --> 01:17:12,125
Speaker 2:  AstroTurf brigade attacked me. Some developers tried this, they went in

1351
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:15,085
Speaker 2:  front of the court again, the judge said, I look, stop it.

1352
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:19,805
Speaker 2:  Like we'll figure this out when we get there. I I, apple has to issue its

1353
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,525
Speaker 2:  entitlements and do all this stuff and everyone thought I was wrong. This

1354
01:17:22,525 --> 01:17:24,725
Speaker 2:  is true. This is like a real sequence events that I'm very hot about. The

1355
01:17:24,725 --> 01:17:28,445
Speaker 2:  point of all this is Epic went to the judge

1356
01:17:28,845 --> 01:17:32,565
Speaker 2:  recently and said Apple is only allowing one external link to a

1357
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:36,365
Speaker 2:  fixed webpage and you are not even allowed to say it's cheaper

1358
01:17:36,425 --> 01:17:40,165
Speaker 2:  on the webpage. Like all of the rules about what you're allowed to do to

1359
01:17:40,165 --> 01:17:42,725
Speaker 2:  get around anti steering are basically anti steering. It's such a

1360
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:45,565
Speaker 6:  Punk thing. You're basically allowed to say this is a website.

1361
01:17:46,185 --> 01:17:49,365
Speaker 2:  Yep. And it's, it's at the very beginning of the flow, right? So If, you

1362
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:52,645
Speaker 2:  have an app with other things you can buy in it. You are not even allowed

1363
01:17:52,785 --> 01:17:56,725
Speaker 2:  in that area of your app to put links to an external website

1364
01:17:56,725 --> 01:17:59,445
Speaker 2:  where you can buy stuff. It's beautiful If, you are allowed to have one link.

1365
01:18:00,595 --> 01:18:04,125
Speaker 2:  That link when you click on it, if you're logged into the app, can't even

1366
01:18:04,355 --> 01:18:06,125
Speaker 2:  pass your login info to the website.

1367
01:18:06,755 --> 01:18:10,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I always think of the Kindle app as the easiest way to explain this

1368
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:13,525
Speaker 6:  because it's like the, the way it should work is you should be able to go

1369
01:18:13,525 --> 01:18:15,965
Speaker 6:  into, I mean the way it should work is you should be able to buy Kindle stuff

1370
01:18:16,075 --> 01:18:19,165
Speaker 6:  from your, but there should be a link on every book that says buy this on

1371
01:18:19,165 --> 01:18:22,885
Speaker 6:  the web. That is explicitly against the rules. You can have one link

1372
01:18:23,085 --> 01:18:26,725
Speaker 6:  in one place in the app that says books

1373
01:18:26,905 --> 01:18:30,885
Speaker 6:  on web. That's, that's basically the entirety of what is

1374
01:18:30,885 --> 01:18:31,565
Speaker 6:  allowed by Apple. Yeah.

1375
01:18:31,565 --> 01:18:35,525
Speaker 2:  Or or or sign up on web but not four 30% cheaper or not it's

1376
01:18:35,525 --> 01:18:38,205
Speaker 2:  cheaper on the web because Apple charges us a fee. Right. None of that's

1377
01:18:38,205 --> 01:18:38,885
Speaker 2:  allowed. Do they get the

1378
01:18:38,885 --> 01:18:41,405
Speaker 5:  Preposition? Like is the preposition allowed the on,

1379
01:18:41,605 --> 01:18:44,005
Speaker 2:  I mean Apple's totally in control of this. Oh by the way If, you click the

1380
01:18:44,005 --> 01:18:47,045
Speaker 2:  link, you get a warning screen that says you're leaving this app where Tim

1381
01:18:47,045 --> 01:18:49,485
Speaker 2:  Cook will protect you with sword and shield. This

1382
01:18:49,485 --> 01:18:51,205
Speaker 5:  Is a buff Tim Cook picture.

1383
01:18:51,395 --> 01:18:54,845
Speaker 2:  This is all true. So epic drags apple back into court where the, 'cause the

1384
01:18:54,845 --> 01:18:58,325
Speaker 2:  judge in 2121 said, I will decide if apple's in compliance with my injunction

1385
01:18:58,385 --> 01:19:02,085
Speaker 2:  not Apple. I'm gonna decide. So the judge, so epic

1386
01:19:02,295 --> 01:19:05,685
Speaker 2:  drags apple back to court. There's a, there's a hearing this week. I just

1387
01:19:05,685 --> 01:19:09,205
Speaker 2:  wanna read you some things that were said in this hearing to Apple

1388
01:19:09,765 --> 01:19:11,485
Speaker 2:  as they talk about buttons and links

1389
01:19:13,685 --> 01:19:17,525
Speaker 2:  and this is to an Apple executive. Is it fair to say in today's

1390
01:19:17,545 --> 01:19:19,965
Speaker 2:  day and age that everyone understands that

1391
01:19:20,545 --> 01:19:23,725
Speaker 2:  www.url.com is an external website on the worldwide web?

1392
01:19:25,145 --> 01:19:28,045
Speaker 2:  That's just a question like do you really think people are this stupid apple

1393
01:19:29,195 --> 01:19:32,925
Speaker 2:  Pete in society people make lots of purchases on the web all the time. Would

1394
01:19:32,925 --> 01:19:34,325
Speaker 2:  you agree with that? Yes.

1395
01:19:36,025 --> 01:19:39,045
Speaker 2:  And they understand that Apple trusts its users that the web is separate

1396
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:42,925
Speaker 2:  and apart from different even on an iOS device, right? Yeah.

1397
01:19:43,785 --> 01:19:46,405
Speaker 2:  Do do people know that clicking on a link, taking you out of an app takes

1398
01:19:46,405 --> 01:19:49,125
Speaker 2:  you outta the app. That's where Apple is in buttons and links

1399
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:54,165
Speaker 2:  and then there's the judge who interjects in the middle of a

1400
01:19:54,165 --> 01:19:57,165
Speaker 2:  conversation about button design because Apple has

1401
01:19:57,755 --> 01:19:59,885
Speaker 2:  constricted the design of buttons.

1402
01:20:01,605 --> 01:20:04,925
Speaker 2:  I can't imagine a logical reason why Apple would demand that of competitor

1403
01:20:05,075 --> 01:20:08,485
Speaker 2:  apps. What's a logical competitive reason for not

1404
01:20:08,495 --> 01:20:12,005
Speaker 2:  suggesting but demanding it other than to stifle

1405
01:20:12,005 --> 01:20:15,645
Speaker 2:  competition? I see no answer. Can you give me one

1406
01:20:16,715 --> 01:20:17,645
Speaker 2:  buttons and links?

1407
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:18,685
Speaker 5:  Did they give

1408
01:20:18,685 --> 01:20:22,325
Speaker 2:  Them, it took three years? No, no. To just blah blah blah security. Oh it

1409
01:20:22,325 --> 01:20:25,685
Speaker 2:  took three years. But Apple is now in this fight

1410
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:29,845
Speaker 2:  over the design of buttons and links in its apps because that

1411
01:20:29,845 --> 01:20:33,485
Speaker 2:  injunction is actually a big deal and they have not

1412
01:20:33,965 --> 01:20:37,645
Speaker 2:  actually provided a reason why they are constraining the

1413
01:20:37,645 --> 01:20:40,885
Speaker 2:  design of buttons and links in their apps. Which by the way are different.

1414
01:20:41,165 --> 01:20:45,045
Speaker 2:  A button is supposed just do something, a link is, takes

1415
01:20:45,045 --> 01:20:48,685
Speaker 2:  you somewhere else, right? So these are different in terms of construction

1416
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:52,405
Speaker 2:  and I think Apple and it's hubris, all the stuff we've talked about, they've

1417
01:20:52,505 --> 01:20:56,365
Speaker 2:  run into the judge saying, no, no, I meant something when I issued this order

1418
01:20:57,945 --> 01:21:00,885
Speaker 2:  and you can't give me reasons that are not just straight anti-competitive,

1419
01:21:01,245 --> 01:21:04,045
Speaker 2:  malicious compliance reasons. I dunno this is gonna turn out, it's just an

1420
01:21:04,045 --> 01:21:06,725
Speaker 2:  evidentiary hearing right now. Maybe the judge is gonna find apple's not

1421
01:21:06,725 --> 01:21:10,605
Speaker 2:  in compliance. Maybe this DOJ lawsuit's gonna break it all open. I

1422
01:21:10,605 --> 01:21:13,845
Speaker 2:  don't know, maybe a bunch of Europeans are gonna hurl cheese at Apple until

1423
01:21:13,845 --> 01:21:16,965
Speaker 2:  they're stop it. Something's gonna happen. But I'm just saying right now,

1424
01:21:17,535 --> 01:21:21,165
Speaker 2:  three years after the epic case, apple's in a courtroom

1425
01:21:21,795 --> 01:21:25,525
Speaker 2:  defending its own malicious compliance because it was inevitable that

1426
01:21:25,665 --> 01:21:27,685
Speaker 2:  the buttons and links conversation would come back around.

1427
01:21:28,065 --> 01:21:31,285
Speaker 6:  And it's been interesting to watch these fights get more and more specific

1428
01:21:31,435 --> 01:21:35,245
Speaker 6:  over time too. And I think this is the thing that is actually

1429
01:21:35,245 --> 01:21:38,245
Speaker 6:  going to affect real change, right? Like we talked about this with the emulators

1430
01:21:38,505 --> 01:21:41,805
Speaker 6:  the other week. Yes. That as these things get whittled down from these sort

1431
01:21:41,805 --> 01:21:45,125
Speaker 6:  of big philosophical debates into like here is a thing about the experience

1432
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:48,725
Speaker 6:  that is broken and you can't explain to me why it's broken other than

1433
01:21:49,665 --> 01:21:53,565
Speaker 6:  you believe you deserve all of the money. That is actually the way that Apple

1434
01:21:53,585 --> 01:21:57,565
Speaker 6:  is being pride open and it is happening like in these little tiny pieces

1435
01:21:58,555 --> 01:22:02,445
Speaker 6:  much more quickly than it's going to happen in some grand. Yeah. You're not

1436
01:22:02,445 --> 01:22:05,565
Speaker 6:  allowed to be like this anymore way. So I think it's like the, the death

1437
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:09,165
Speaker 6:  by a thousand cuts thing is like very much underway in a really fascinating

1438
01:22:09,165 --> 01:22:09,325
Speaker 6:  way.

1439
01:22:09,595 --> 01:22:13,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And this stuff takes time. Like the DOJ lawsuit, that's a decade.

1440
01:22:13,785 --> 01:22:14,965
Speaker 6:  Oh easily It's,

1441
01:22:14,965 --> 01:22:18,885
Speaker 2:  Its a decade. Like you can decide whether it is good or bad. You can have

1442
01:22:19,085 --> 01:22:22,765
Speaker 2:  whatever feelings about the complaint you want a decade from now. We will

1443
01:22:22,765 --> 01:22:26,605
Speaker 2:  see the results of that case on how the devices we use. It took

1444
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:30,605
Speaker 2:  three years from the Epic case for us to be back in a courtroom saying

1445
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:34,605
Speaker 2:  actually your weird link entitlement idea might be anti-competitive and that

1446
01:22:34,605 --> 01:22:38,205
Speaker 2:  still has to play out. So I would just, you need some patience here. But

1447
01:22:38,205 --> 01:22:41,965
Speaker 2:  I agree with you David. It's like it's starting in a way that Apple can no

1448
01:22:41,965 --> 01:22:42,525
Speaker 2:  longer defend.

1449
01:22:43,445 --> 01:22:47,325
Speaker 5:  I just spent a lot of this time on meta AI trying to make it

1450
01:22:47,325 --> 01:22:51,245
Speaker 5:  show me images of a shredded Tim Cook protecting people from

1451
01:22:51,245 --> 01:22:53,685
Speaker 5:  buttons and links and it wouldn't do it.

1452
01:22:54,765 --> 01:22:55,245
Speaker 6:  I went to

1453
01:22:55,905 --> 01:22:59,725
Speaker 6:  www.url.comwhileweweresittinghereanddiscoveredthaturl.com

1454
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:01,285
Speaker 6:  is for sale. So that's cool.

1455
01:23:01,925 --> 01:23:04,525
Speaker 2:  I just think If, you have your executives on the stand and the question is,

1456
01:23:04,525 --> 01:23:07,445
Speaker 2:  people in society make lots of purchases on the web all the time. Would you

1457
01:23:07,445 --> 01:23:09,645
Speaker 2:  agree? And the answer is yes. Like

1458
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:14,205
Speaker 6:  You're probably done for so good Eli, in in,

1459
01:23:14,225 --> 01:23:17,925
Speaker 6:  in the spirit of kindness, I would like to bequeath you my lightning round

1460
01:23:17,925 --> 01:23:19,725
Speaker 6:  because you have another victory lap I'd like you to take.

1461
01:23:20,085 --> 01:23:22,685
Speaker 2:  I do, I do. I do. I'm very excited about this one. I'll make this one quick.

1462
01:23:22,845 --> 01:23:26,765
Speaker 2:  'cause again, in this fixture app, nothing has happened. So we'll end

1463
01:23:26,765 --> 01:23:27,605
Speaker 2:  the show where we began

1464
01:23:28,705 --> 01:23:29,445
Speaker 6:  In Wisconsin

1465
01:23:29,465 --> 01:23:32,645
Speaker 2:  In south in southeastern Wisconsin where I was a child.

1466
01:23:33,955 --> 01:23:35,165
Speaker 5:  Were the cheese curds really

1467
01:23:35,285 --> 01:23:37,445
Speaker 2:  Squeaky. They're good, they're good, they're good. Everyone in Wisconsin,

1468
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:41,045
Speaker 2:  they're particularly well Madison. I would say Madison is where I, where

1469
01:23:41,045 --> 01:23:44,925
Speaker 2:  I enjoyed the cheese curd lifestyle the most. But President

1470
01:23:44,925 --> 01:23:48,885
Speaker 2:  Biden was in Racine this week. He was announcing

1471
01:23:49,245 --> 01:23:53,045
Speaker 2:  a data center built to be built by Microsoft. So we had 2000

1472
01:23:53,285 --> 01:23:55,805
Speaker 2:  construction jobs and then 2000 permanent jobs to build this data center.

1473
01:23:56,515 --> 01:24:00,205
Speaker 2:  This is, I would just say politically opportunistic at its finest.

1474
01:24:00,405 --> 01:24:03,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Microsoft had already purchased this land. They were already, they

1475
01:24:03,565 --> 01:24:05,965
Speaker 2:  had already announced the data center. They'd already done all the permitting,

1476
01:24:05,965 --> 01:24:09,805
Speaker 2:  all the stuff. Joe Biden just showed up and was like, look at the jobs

1477
01:24:09,965 --> 01:24:13,925
Speaker 2:  I made. Great. I'm super excited for like do politics. I'm

1478
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:17,645
Speaker 2:  happy for you. The point of this is that they are building this

1479
01:24:17,745 --> 01:24:21,685
Speaker 2:  on the land that was supposed to be the Foxcon site and

1480
01:24:21,685 --> 01:24:25,645
Speaker 2:  Joe Biden's political opportunism is he's standing there and he

1481
01:24:25,645 --> 01:24:28,685
Speaker 2:  is like literally, I think he said something along the lines of Trump didn't

1482
01:24:28,685 --> 01:24:32,325
Speaker 2:  give you any jobs that I'm giving you actual jobs because it's the Foxcon

1483
01:24:32,325 --> 01:24:35,005
Speaker 2:  site where Trump waved a golden shovel around and promised an LCD factory

1484
01:24:35,005 --> 01:24:38,925
Speaker 2:  that was supposed to bring 13,000 jobs to this region. And we

1485
01:24:39,305 --> 01:24:42,725
Speaker 2:  at The Verge, someone famously always knew that was a lie,

1486
01:24:43,925 --> 01:24:47,485
Speaker 2:  reported on it quite a bit. We won an award. Josh has won an award for his

1487
01:24:47,485 --> 01:24:51,245
Speaker 2:  big feature on it. That feature, actually Chris Hayes read it on M-S-N-B-C

1488
01:24:51,245 --> 01:24:54,965
Speaker 2:  last night like just straight up. He was like, Biden announced some things.

1489
01:24:54,985 --> 01:24:58,605
Speaker 2:  You might remember this as Fox on and then just read some of

1490
01:24:58,745 --> 01:25:01,325
Speaker 2:  Josh's feature to the camera. That's awesome. To explain what had happened.

1491
01:25:01,325 --> 01:25:04,565
Speaker 2:  There are rules. Congratulations to Josh. He reported the hell of that story.

1492
01:25:05,385 --> 01:25:09,285
Speaker 2:  The victory lap I would like to take is to remind everyone and

1493
01:25:09,285 --> 01:25:13,165
Speaker 2:  to initiate our, our newest members of the audience. During

1494
01:25:13,235 --> 01:25:16,965
Speaker 2:  that period of time while we were doing all that reporting, I received a

1495
01:25:16,965 --> 01:25:20,685
Speaker 2:  number of hilariously threatening emails from anonymous foxcon executives

1496
01:25:21,285 --> 01:25:24,685
Speaker 2:  telling us, reminding us, insisting that we leave them alone.

1497
01:25:26,155 --> 01:25:28,965
Speaker 2:  Literally the emails would say leave us alone. And then they would try to

1498
01:25:28,965 --> 01:25:32,925
Speaker 2:  explain to me what Foxconn's AI plus eight K

1499
01:25:32,925 --> 01:25:36,805
Speaker 2:  plus 5G strategy was Galaxy brand strategy. It

1500
01:25:36,805 --> 01:25:40,285
Speaker 2:  was nothing. by the way Fox on has abandoned ai eight k plus 5G.

1501
01:25:40,555 --> 01:25:43,365
Speaker 2:  This is true. They've abandoned it. If. you go to the Fox on in Wisconsin

1502
01:25:43,365 --> 01:25:46,405
Speaker 2:  website now, which is literally, I believe just foxcon in Wisconsin dot com.

1503
01:25:46,965 --> 01:25:50,285
Speaker 2:  You can see they have a new strategy which is three plus three equals infinity.

1504
01:25:51,195 --> 01:25:51,885
Speaker 2:  This is true.

1505
01:25:52,995 --> 01:25:53,725
Speaker 6:  It's even worse.

1506
01:25:54,385 --> 01:25:57,405
Speaker 2:  How did they make it worse? It's a hundred percent true. Oh God. That their

1507
01:25:57,405 --> 01:26:00,725
Speaker 2:  new strategy is three plus three equals infinity. And then there's a lengthy

1508
01:26:00,725 --> 01:26:04,565
Speaker 2:  section of that website dedicated to how you can see the,

1509
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,645
Speaker 2:  the dome that they built from the highway.

1510
01:26:11,445 --> 01:26:14,405
Speaker 2:  I dunno what to tell you man. They built a little dome. It's like, I keep

1511
01:26:14,405 --> 01:26:18,125
Speaker 2:  calling it temu Epcot like it's a little baby dome by a dome. It was supposed

1512
01:26:18,125 --> 01:26:22,045
Speaker 2:  to be the dot of an I. Oh, they were gonna spell

1513
01:26:22,185 --> 01:26:26,045
Speaker 2:  Foxcon. FII Foxconn industrial internet. They were gonna spell it in buildings

1514
01:26:26,465 --> 01:26:27,525
Speaker 2:  and it's a dome.

1515
01:26:27,525 --> 01:26:27,925
Speaker 14:  A lot of letters.

1516
01:26:28,195 --> 01:26:31,285
Speaker 2:  It's a lot. Well it's only three. They only got to the dot, which is the

1517
01:26:31,285 --> 01:26:35,245
Speaker 2:  dome. They insisted for years. This is true that the dome was a

1518
01:26:35,245 --> 01:26:38,765
Speaker 2:  data center. And I would have various conversations

1519
01:26:39,035 --> 01:26:42,965
Speaker 2:  with like data center people do like, would you ever make a data center

1520
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:45,165
Speaker 2:  in the shape of a dome? Do you think that would be? And they would all be

1521
01:26:45,165 --> 01:26:48,285
Speaker 2:  like, no, I don't. I don't know. We wouldn't. It turns out the dome was just

1522
01:26:48,285 --> 01:26:52,245
Speaker 2:  like a like a party center. Yeah. It was like where corrupt Wisconsin politicians

1523
01:26:52,245 --> 01:26:54,045
Speaker 2:  would have drinks and take photos with

1524
01:26:54,745 --> 01:26:55,645
Speaker 14:  The dome. With

1525
01:26:55,645 --> 01:26:59,405
Speaker 2:  Their dome. The dome remains. That whole thing remains.

1526
01:26:59,565 --> 01:27:02,165
Speaker 2:  I know what's gonna happen there. There's some rumor, the building servers.

1527
01:27:02,645 --> 01:27:05,565
Speaker 2:  Microsoft is now taking all of the industrialization that was built up the

1528
01:27:05,565 --> 01:27:08,645
Speaker 2:  water, the power, da da da to build an AI data data center.

1529
01:27:09,835 --> 01:27:13,085
Speaker 2:  Alright? But I want to end here with one of the best things that has ever

1530
01:27:13,245 --> 01:27:17,045
Speaker 2:  happened on the show. Okay? Which is all those emails that got

1531
01:27:17,045 --> 01:27:20,845
Speaker 2:  about leaving people alone. I would read them on the show and then people

1532
01:27:20,845 --> 01:27:24,805
Speaker 2:  would make memes and songs in one

1533
01:27:24,805 --> 01:27:27,565
Speaker 2:  of my favorite songs, which I thought about today. As I watched Joe Biden

1534
01:27:27,635 --> 01:27:31,405
Speaker 2:  dunk on Trump and his golden shovel. I was like, it would rule

1535
01:27:31,865 --> 01:27:35,685
Speaker 2:  if Biden would just play this song that VERGE has listener Jackson

1536
01:27:35,895 --> 01:27:39,605
Speaker 2:  Hayes wrote for us about the factory. Liam, can we play the song

1537
01:27:43,195 --> 01:27:45,125
Speaker 14:  Neli? You didn't listen to me,

1538
01:27:46,745 --> 01:27:49,765
Speaker 14:  but that's okay because we're gonna tell you what you already knew for months.

1539
01:27:51,665 --> 01:27:52,965
Speaker 14:  You didn't leave us alone.

1540
01:27:54,855 --> 01:27:58,125
Speaker 14:  Leave us alone. You didn't leave us alone.

1541
01:27:59,855 --> 01:28:00,685
Speaker 14:  Leave us alone.

1542
01:28:03,785 --> 01:28:07,605
Speaker 14:  AI meant new generation mobility and

1543
01:28:07,605 --> 01:28:11,205
Speaker 14:  self driving cars. Wait, is that story we were running Jeremy? Okay.

1544
01:28:12,745 --> 01:28:16,405
Speaker 14:  AK means smart safety and security through

1545
01:28:16,645 --> 01:28:20,525
Speaker 14:  AK technology. I mean come on Neil, you should know this. 5G

1546
01:28:20,655 --> 01:28:24,485
Speaker 14:  means pioneering. Wait, medical solutions. Crap.

1547
01:28:24,485 --> 01:28:28,285
Speaker 14:  That's supposed to mean on some Health Cloud

1548
01:28:29,075 --> 01:28:32,685
Speaker 14:  network. Okay, you didn't leave us alone.

1549
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:37,525
Speaker 14:  Leave us alone. It's catchy. It's good you didn't leave us alone.

1550
01:28:39,055 --> 01:28:39,885
Speaker 14:  Leave us alone.

1551
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:45,245
Speaker 14:  It was just saying K and 5G.

1552
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:49,565
Speaker 14:  Well I see how that was hard to believe.

1553
01:28:50,865 --> 01:28:52,005
Speaker 14:  You didn't leave a spot.

1554
01:28:52,435 --> 01:28:52,925
Speaker 2:  It's a bot.

1555
01:28:53,735 --> 01:28:56,965
Speaker 14:  Leave it alone. You didn't leave it slow.

1556
01:28:58,695 --> 01:28:59,525
Speaker 14:  Leave it alone.

1557
01:29:00,665 --> 01:29:02,485
Speaker 2:  Now I just want you to imagine, hey, you

1558
01:29:02,585 --> 01:29:02,805
Speaker 3:  Win.

1559
01:29:04,575 --> 01:29:08,485
Speaker 2:  Can't make that on an iPad. Well with the power of AI

1560
01:29:08,485 --> 01:29:12,445
Speaker 2:  technology. So thank you to Jackson, one of my all time favorite first cast

1561
01:29:12,445 --> 01:29:15,445
Speaker 2:  moments. I hope for listening. I just want you to imagine Joe Biden

1562
01:29:16,095 --> 01:29:20,045
Speaker 2:  announcing the Microsoft deal and then me like, as a reminder, busting out

1563
01:29:20,045 --> 01:29:23,445
Speaker 2:  his acoustic guitar. He just takes a seat.

1564
01:29:24,915 --> 01:29:28,565
Speaker 2:  That whole sequence just, I just wanna remind people that sequencer

1565
01:29:28,565 --> 01:29:31,885
Speaker 2:  reporting was like mid pandemic. This is the

1566
01:29:32,205 --> 01:29:35,885
Speaker 2:  weirdest time in like reporting you could do. And we were

1567
01:29:35,885 --> 01:29:39,005
Speaker 2:  reporting on this weird factory that didn't exist and I was getting these

1568
01:29:39,215 --> 01:29:43,205
Speaker 2:  crazy emails. Just leave us alone. Just leave us alone. That was awesome.

1569
01:29:43,695 --> 01:29:47,645
Speaker 2:  Leave us alone. Anyway, it's in, it's a data center now. There's a

1570
01:29:47,645 --> 01:29:51,565
Speaker 2:  little dome. You can go look at the dome. I have pictures of the dome.
