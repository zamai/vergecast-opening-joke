Description: This week, everything is a HomePod. And has ads. The Verge’s Jen Pattison-Tuohy joins the show to talk about all of Amazon’s new hardware, the current state of Alexa Plus, and whether the new Kindle Scribe is the one we’ve been waiting for. Then, The Verge’s Emma Roth tells Jen and David about her experience with Telly, the TV that ships to your house for free in exchange for showing you ads all the time. Telly may not be for everyone. Finally, in the lightning round, the gang talks about a handy new Spotify feature, Emma’s first Waymo ride, and the glory that is Chunk.

00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:48,435
Speaker 7:  Hi, David. Yes. It's, it's all about round fabric wrapped

4
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:48,955
Speaker 7:  balls.

5
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:52,795
Speaker 5:  This is just what we do now. We have one video app, we have one idea about

6
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:55,955
Speaker 5:  phones. We have one idea about ai, and we have one idea about speakers Indeed.

7
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:59,315
Speaker 5:  And then this is what we do. So you are in our New York studio right now

8
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:03,275
Speaker 5:  because you've been in New York doing like a, just a

9
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:07,195
Speaker 5:  truly wild, like 48 hours of smart home and speaker

10
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,915
Speaker 5:  news. Yes. How are you holding up?

11
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:13,435
Speaker 8:  I'm, I'm, I'm doing good. Yeah, I'm still on the high. I'm still on the smart

12
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:14,795
Speaker 8:  speak high. That's

13
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:17,955
Speaker 5:  Good. I'm glad for you. So we, there's, there's like a ton of news This week.

14
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:20,835
Speaker 5:  Yes. So we have so exciting big Amazon event, which we're gonna spend a lot

15
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:24,115
Speaker 5:  of time talking about. We have a bunch of Google stuff that all also happened

16
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:27,915
Speaker 5:  This week. Weird timing from Google. On that front, we're gonna

17
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:31,555
Speaker 5:  talk about tele the TV that I care more about than most

18
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:35,395
Speaker 5:  reasonable things in my life. We have some Microsoft News. We're gonna

19
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:38,675
Speaker 5:  talk about soa, we're gonna talk about all kinds of different stuff. There's

20
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:40,875
Speaker 5:  just a lot to get to. We're gonna get to all of it. But let's start with

21
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,395
Speaker 5:  Amazon, because I think this was like the, the sort of gadget news

22
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:48,595
Speaker 5:  of the week. You were there. You went to this event, this is kind

23
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:52,475
Speaker 5:  of an Amazon event we've ve been waiting for, for a while.

24
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:56,755
Speaker 5:  So Panos Pane who ran devices and windows at Microsoft

25
00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:59,525
Speaker 5:  for a long time, left to go to Amazon and

26
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:04,085
Speaker 5:  basically like started making giant promises about the future of AI hardware.

27
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:06,965
Speaker 5:  I think you, you And I have both talked to him in the intervening time

28
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:11,965
Speaker 5:  and you, you get a pretty clear sense that the idea was

29
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,525
Speaker 5:  we are going to come out with a big swing about

30
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,165
Speaker 5:  new ideas about what Alexa in particular

31
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:23,765
Speaker 5:  is going to be. So you, you went to this event on Tuesday, I should say.

32
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:27,205
Speaker 5:  We're recording this on Wednesday morning, because again, scheduling is insane.

33
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:30,005
Speaker 5:  We will be back to our normal time very soon and I'm very excited about it.

34
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:33,605
Speaker 5:  But tell me about the event. What was the, what were the vibes like in, in

35
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:35,205
Speaker 5:  the room at this launch event? Yeah.

36
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:39,085
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So it was actually the same venue as the event

37
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:42,765
Speaker 8:  they had in February when they announced the sort of revamped Alexa

38
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:46,205
Speaker 8:  Plus. So it had very sort of similar vibes, looked very similar.

39
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:51,365
Speaker 8:  Panos had his same sort of very strong

40
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:54,405
Speaker 8:  personality. He really fills the room

41
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,845
Speaker 8:  and he, he did, he came on stage. There was nothing there. There was no set

42
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:03,205
Speaker 8:  decoration or anything. It's very, very clean. They had some little

43
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:07,405
Speaker 8:  plints on the side that were empty. So that we were like, okay, so at some

44
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:10,885
Speaker 8:  point, hopefully something is gonna appear. And sort of

45
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:14,405
Speaker 8:  magically during the event when they talked about each new piece of hardware,

46
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:18,885
Speaker 8:  little devices popped up on the, on the plinth. So it was very

47
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:22,645
Speaker 8:  nicely done. The vibes were actually a little low key

48
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:26,805
Speaker 8:  in a weird way to start with. But once,

49
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:28,965
Speaker 8:  once, you know, once we got going, it was more

50
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:34,685
Speaker 8:  exciting because I think we've all been waiting for some really

51
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:39,085
Speaker 8:  interesting hardware. Especially because, so Panos started at

52
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:42,885
Speaker 8:  Amazon almost two years ago now. So this, we were

53
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:46,045
Speaker 8:  expecting a lot of this to have really have his stamp on it and

54
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:50,325
Speaker 8:  talking to people at the event. It sounds like he'd brought in a

55
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:53,885
Speaker 8:  number of people from Microsoft to help design

56
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,885
Speaker 8:  these new devices. The, the new head of design

57
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:02,125
Speaker 8:  and that the VP of Alexa and devices are both

58
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:06,685
Speaker 8:  Microsoft alum who have moved to Amazon. So, you know, I was,

59
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:10,805
Speaker 8:  and Tom Warren asked me to ask him if when he was gonna put a floating hinge

60
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:14,245
Speaker 8:  on an echo. So I was expecting, I was expecting a lot

61
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:18,565
Speaker 8:  and ultimately, I don't know, I'm not sure that what we got

62
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:22,125
Speaker 8:  was necessarily like a whole new vision,

63
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:26,605
Speaker 8:  but it was definitely a big jump up from

64
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:29,885
Speaker 8:  where Amazon's hardware has been to date. And

65
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:34,125
Speaker 8:  talking with Panos afterwards, he said the key, and he didn't say

66
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,285
Speaker 8:  difference because that would be mean to his predecessor, but I filled in

67
00:05:37,285 --> 00:05:41,205
Speaker 8:  the blank. The key difference is rather than starting from a price

68
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:44,685
Speaker 8:  point, they started from, he said,

69
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:48,645
Speaker 8:  where what the customer needs. So a product

70
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:51,365
Speaker 8:  that's gonna fulfill what you need it to do,

71
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:56,595
Speaker 8:  not just what Amazon was looking

72
00:05:56,695 --> 00:06:00,495
Speaker 8:  to provide, if that makes sense. Right. So the Echo Show devices in the

73
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:04,255
Speaker 8:  past have, have been very interesting products. They filled

74
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:07,855
Speaker 8:  an interesting space, often difficult to

75
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:11,735
Speaker 8:  figure out exactly what they were meant to do, but, but they were interesting.

76
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:15,615
Speaker 8:  But they were always very underpowered and like touching a touch screen is

77
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:18,615
Speaker 8:  something we're used to doing all the time and it should respond very quickly.

78
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:22,855
Speaker 8:  And that is sort of, for me, the key takeaway from this is that touchscreen

79
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,335
Speaker 8:  now on the Echo shows so much better. Interesting. I mean, ing, it's like

80
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:30,185
Speaker 8:  a tablet, not like a smart display. Yeah.

81
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:32,785
Speaker 5:  Well, so, okay, so let, let's actually start with those. So the, the four

82
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:35,665
Speaker 5:  new devices, just to, for anybody who didn't follow the event,

83
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:39,425
Speaker 5:  starting from the cheapest. I think I can, I think I can do this off the

84
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:42,785
Speaker 5:  top of my head. There's the Echo do Max, which is a hundred dollars. Yes.

85
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:46,625
Speaker 5:  And is now the sort of basic smart speaker. It is. If you close your

86
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,705
Speaker 5:  eyes and imagine a home pod mini, you're 95% of the way there.

87
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:53,345
Speaker 8:  Especially if you put it up right the other way. Just

88
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,065
Speaker 5:  Tilt it a little. Yeah. Yes. And I think that's not to degra. I actually

89
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:59,625
Speaker 5:  think the Echo do Max is the single most interesting of these devices. Yeah.

90
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,105
Speaker 5:  And we can come back to that. Yeah. But then there's the Echo Show eight,

91
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:07,385
Speaker 5:  which is 180 bucks. And then the Echo show, is it 10

92
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,825
Speaker 5:  or 11? The other one Echo

93
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:12,665
Speaker 8:  Show 11. 11. So it's the upgrade to what was the 10? Okay, so,

94
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:16,305
Speaker 8:  okay, so the 11 is the size of the screen. Right. So the eight is the eight

95
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:20,265
Speaker 8:  inch or eight and a bit, and yeah, so it's the Echo Show 11. Okay. And then,

96
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:24,465
Speaker 5:  And then there's the Echo Studio. Yes. Which is

97
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:28,505
Speaker 5:  220 bucks the same price as the Echo Show 11.

98
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:32,465
Speaker 5:  Yes. And it's basically, it is designed to be the like great

99
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:36,185
Speaker 5:  sounding speaker. I think those really high-end smart

100
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:40,025
Speaker 5:  speakers exist only for executives that work at that company and no one

101
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:42,505
Speaker 5:  buys them. That's just a theory that I've had for a long time.

102
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:47,585
Speaker 5:  But I do think, I, I think you And I agree on something which is that the

103
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:51,225
Speaker 5:  best version of a smart speaker in

104
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:55,065
Speaker 5:  2025 probably has a screen. And so I think for that reason,

105
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,985
Speaker 5:  these shows are the most interesting ones. So let's just start with those.

106
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:02,825
Speaker 5:  Yeah, tell me about the, like, if you're starting from, not just, we have

107
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:05,185
Speaker 5:  to make this thing as inexpensive and accessible to as many people as possible,

108
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:08,665
Speaker 5:  but we wanna make it good. Yeah. What does that actually look like in the

109
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:09,025
Speaker 5:  new shows?

110
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:12,945
Speaker 8:  Yeah, so the screen is the key. And when these devices

111
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:16,425
Speaker 8:  launched, the Echo show was the first smart display, and then we had the

112
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:19,985
Speaker 8:  Nest hub. They were low cost, low

113
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:23,625
Speaker 8:  component price. You know, they were trying to sort of

114
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:27,625
Speaker 8:  be an easy to add to your home device. I remember Google

115
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,305
Speaker 8:  Home was giving away Nest hubs like willy-nilly. And

116
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:32,865
Speaker 5:  I think at a certain time that made a lot of sense, right? It did what what

117
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:35,945
Speaker 5:  you needed was to give people a reason to try this stuff. Yes. And I think

118
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:39,625
Speaker 5:  to like for the first generation of smart speaker and smart device to just

119
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:43,545
Speaker 5:  basically be like, throw it in with any box that

120
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:46,305
Speaker 5:  is leaving your warehouse. Yes. Which is like what both Google and Amazon

121
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:50,145
Speaker 5:  did for a long time. Made a lot of sense. But I do think we're,

122
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:53,385
Speaker 5:  we have to be past that now. Yes. So I think, I think it is good that we

123
00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:54,905
Speaker 5:  seem to be pushing past

124
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:58,565
Speaker 8:  That because, and what they did, just when they first came out, smart displays

125
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:02,045
Speaker 8:  were just like a visual cue for what you were talking to your assistant about.

126
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:05,965
Speaker 8:  Now they're turning into more devices

127
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:09,965
Speaker 8:  that you interface with to control things in your home for the smart home.

128
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:14,245
Speaker 8:  But also, you know, you can watch TV on some of them. You can,

129
00:09:14,585 --> 00:09:18,125
Speaker 8:  you know, scroll through photos, you can interact with the voice assistant

130
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:20,765
Speaker 8:  and like look up things and click and go to different

131
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:25,165
Speaker 8:  aspects of the assistant, like if you wanna book tickets, those types of

132
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,125
Speaker 8:  things. These are all things that Alexa Plus can do. So they really needed

133
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:32,085
Speaker 8:  the hardware to be able to work, to have more power and you to be

134
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:35,405
Speaker 8:  able to do more because it was so frustrating. You would ask it something

135
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:38,925
Speaker 8:  and there would be something on the screen and you would sort of go to tap

136
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:42,685
Speaker 8:  it or do something and it, it's like, yeah, you can't do that here.

137
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,485
Speaker 8:  Yeah. You have to go to your phone. What are you thinking? So

138
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:50,045
Speaker 8:  now this feels, I mean, it's not a laptop, it's not a tablet, but it feels

139
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:54,165
Speaker 8:  much closer to that kind of an experience when you are interacting

140
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:57,285
Speaker 8:  with it. Again, I literally spent five minutes tapping around. So

141
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,845
Speaker 8:  this is all with a big caveat once I've actually got to test it. But from

142
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:05,765
Speaker 8:  what I've seen so far, this is a big upgrade. It was faster. There's

143
00:10:05,765 --> 00:10:09,645
Speaker 8:  a new AZ three pro processor

144
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:13,685
Speaker 8:  that they're using and also a huge upgrade here

145
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:17,445
Speaker 8:  that none of the previous smart displays bar

146
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,565
Speaker 8:  one have got, have managed to do is the thing can actually

147
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:24,725
Speaker 8:  hear you. Hmm. Because

148
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:29,165
Speaker 8:  if you look at Smart displays design, they are a giant screen

149
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:33,285
Speaker 8:  blocking a speaker, all of them. And when you try and talk to it,

150
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:37,605
Speaker 8:  it can't hear you. I have to mute every other echo

151
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:41,965
Speaker 8:  display speaker in my home when I try and talk to a smart display

152
00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:45,805
Speaker 8:  echo because they won't hear, they just won't hear you. Interesting. The

153
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:49,405
Speaker 8:  others will hear you first. So what they've done here is they've lifted the

154
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:52,965
Speaker 8:  screen up, it's now floating, which also makes the design

155
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:56,885
Speaker 8:  look a little more modern than the older ones on top of this speaker.

156
00:10:57,425 --> 00:11:01,045
Speaker 8:  So In theory, your voice should be able to go to the speaker

157
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:04,205
Speaker 8:  underneath and over the top and ran the sides a little bit better. And there's

158
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:07,805
Speaker 8:  this big oblong squashed home pod, mini style

159
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,965
Speaker 8:  speaker on the back. And the sound quality, I didn't get to hear

160
00:11:11,965 --> 00:11:15,645
Speaker 8:  this one, but I was told is in between the max and the studio.

161
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:19,405
Speaker 8:  Okay. So this is slightly better sound quality than the, the max, but not

162
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:22,925
Speaker 8:  as good as the studio. So yeah, this new design with the kind of floating

163
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:26,685
Speaker 8:  display, bigger speaker at the back, but that's more,

164
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:30,685
Speaker 8:  that has a bit more shape isn't just a big bulbous bottom.

165
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,925
Speaker 8:  Like most of them are. I mean, the Nest hub had

166
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:38,085
Speaker 8:  that a little bit. It, it's raised slightly, so there's a little bit of speaker

167
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:41,925
Speaker 8:  below it, but there's a lot more room here. So again, haven't tested

168
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:45,965
Speaker 8:  this, but it looks like the design should be much better for voice

169
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:46,645
Speaker 8:  control. Yeah.

170
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:50,245
Speaker 5:  And there's some interesting ideas in all of that that I think you see across

171
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:53,685
Speaker 5:  the whole line here. One is the, the processor, right? Like they, they made

172
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:57,645
Speaker 5:  a lot of noise about this AZ three chip. Yeah. And the, the things

173
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:00,285
Speaker 5:  it will enable and the speed at which it'll work and the ways that it will

174
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,765
Speaker 5:  be able to like, make this whole process more seamless, which is a huge deal.

175
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,085
Speaker 5:  Right. I think like you hear about the reason people churn out of these devices

176
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:10,965
Speaker 5:  and one of the ones is that it sucks and one of the ones is that

177
00:12:11,285 --> 00:12:14,565
Speaker 5:  it's annoying, right? Like it, the the thing where it doesn't hear you Yes.

178
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,685
Speaker 5:  Is is both like a physical microphone placement problem and a

179
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:21,725
Speaker 5:  processing problem. Yes. And so, like the work that they're doing to solve

180
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:25,565
Speaker 5:  both of those things to just sort of solve one small annoyance

181
00:12:25,565 --> 00:12:28,085
Speaker 5:  at a time, I actually think is really exciting. And it's the same with the

182
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:31,965
Speaker 5:  touchscreen. It's like, you, you, I sort of expected this thing to

183
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:35,845
Speaker 5:  have some like wild new like articulating robot arm And I like

184
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:38,405
Speaker 5:  the stuff we've been hearing about like what Apple might be doing this. Like

185
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:42,285
Speaker 5:  yeah, what if it spun 360 degrees to follow you around the room? And so it

186
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:45,885
Speaker 5:  was actually just like, it was a little bit surprising to see it just be

187
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:48,925
Speaker 5:  like a speaker. Yeah. But then you go through the list and it's like, oh,

188
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:52,325
Speaker 5:  this is actually just trying to poke at everything you actually do with this

189
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:55,965
Speaker 5:  device all day and make it work a little bit better. Better. And I feel like

190
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:59,445
Speaker 5:  that is, that is the precise correct approach for this because it is like,

191
00:12:59,665 --> 00:13:03,605
Speaker 5:  the smart home system, at least in my life, has been

192
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:06,565
Speaker 5:  totally like death by a thousand cuts, right? Yeah. And, and the way to solve

193
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:09,845
Speaker 5:  it is not with some brand new idea about everything, it's just fix the damn

194
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:10,245
Speaker 5:  problems.

195
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:12,685
Speaker 8:  Make it work. Yes. Definitely.

196
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:15,845
Speaker 5:  And, And I think like that's the, there's a lot of that in all of these,

197
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:18,605
Speaker 5:  including things like mic placement. Like I think we're right to be excited

198
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:21,765
Speaker 5:  about mic placement because like when it can hear me I will use it more.

199
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:22,445
Speaker 5:  Exactly.

200
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:26,005
Speaker 8:  It matters. And there's, there's also some other nice touches here. Like

201
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,765
Speaker 8:  Amazon has never been really great about the details with their hardware

202
00:13:30,265 --> 00:13:31,885
Speaker 8:  and like these have fabric wrapped.

203
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,405
Speaker 5:  That's a kind way of saying it. Yeah.

204
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:38,685
Speaker 8:  These have fabric wrapped cables that like lay fat and they match

205
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:42,525
Speaker 8:  the color of the speaker. So no more white cable with a black

206
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:46,405
Speaker 8:  speaker. That is nice too. You know, those just sort of small little things.

207
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:51,205
Speaker 8:  Like there's a purple one, the Purple Nest Max Hub show.

208
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:55,205
Speaker 8:  I'm gonna be doing this all day. Sorry, too many. Yeah, too many. The purple

209
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:59,885
Speaker 8:  show, the Purple Max is very purple and has

210
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:03,885
Speaker 8:  a purple cable and that's just fun. It's like, it's a small thing

211
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,685
Speaker 8:  but it really, you know, that it just elevates the feel of the device. And

212
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:10,935
Speaker 8:  that's what these, these just feel more premium,

213
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:15,615
Speaker 8:  better quality. They have the same kind of, th

214
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:19,295
Speaker 8:  I've learned a lot about 3D knit fabric in the last couple of days, but apparently

215
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:23,335
Speaker 8:  I'm so sorry. This is what is the best thing for speakers. And

216
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:27,015
Speaker 8:  it's not something that any Echos had before and they've brought it to this,

217
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:30,735
Speaker 8:  this is also what gives it the home pod mini feel. And the, and the,

218
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:34,495
Speaker 8:  the Google home speaker also has the same, so they all do

219
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:38,335
Speaker 8:  really feel and look quite similar. But yeah, just, just more

220
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,215
Speaker 8:  premium. The only thing I would say that people are gonna potentially

221
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,975
Speaker 8:  really not like about the new design is there is no physical camera

222
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:46,895
Speaker 8:  shutter anymore.

223
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:47,935
Speaker 5:  Oh, interesting.

224
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:51,965
Speaker 8:  And that was because they said that was because, so

225
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:55,845
Speaker 8:  it has much thinner bezels, which again good. Yeah. But

226
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:59,965
Speaker 8:  that sacrifice, the camera shutter they say, but you

227
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,445
Speaker 8:  still, when you press the mute button, it does turn off the camera. You just

228
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:07,285
Speaker 8:  do not have that physical feeling that it's shuttered.

229
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:09,165
Speaker 8:  And I know that some people do prefer that.

230
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:11,885
Speaker 5:  That's such an interesting trade off. 'cause on the one hand that's like,

231
00:15:12,505 --> 00:15:15,645
Speaker 5:  if the goal is just to sell more devices, I think that's pretty clearly the

232
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:18,445
Speaker 5:  right trade off. Yeah. Like make it look nicer and sacrifice a, a thing that

233
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:21,565
Speaker 5:  is like, makes you feel good, but doesn't necessarily have a huge

234
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:26,085
Speaker 5:  impact on actual functionality of the device. Probably the right trade off.

235
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:29,885
Speaker 5:  But I, I am one of those people who has really, really

236
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:33,645
Speaker 5:  appreciated the thing where I can switch a button and know that it is

237
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:36,765
Speaker 5:  like, just know it is, it is mechanically disconnected. And I think that

238
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:38,525
Speaker 5:  is like important and valuable. Yeah.

239
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:40,925
Speaker 8:  It does give you that peace of mind for sure. Yeah.

240
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:43,325
Speaker 5:  And there's just something about these now And I think like one of the other

241
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:45,485
Speaker 5:  changes that they've made with lot of these devices is they're making the,

242
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:48,165
Speaker 5:  the light rings easier to see from everywhere, which

243
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:49,885
Speaker 8:  I think is a big upgrade. Yes.

244
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,445
Speaker 5:  Oh, I totally agree. Love that. And like, you don't have to sort of like

245
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:54,085
Speaker 5:  lean over the speaker to see if

246
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:56,765
Speaker 8:  It's Yeah, yeah. You can actually reach the buttons rather than just like

247
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:59,765
Speaker 8:  be slapping at it Yeah. To figure out what's gonna happen. Yeah.

248
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:02,845
Speaker 5:  And so I think that that kind of, sort of the, the thing is

249
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:07,285
Speaker 5:  more transparent about what it's doing all the time. Yeah. I think is a good

250
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:10,365
Speaker 5:  tack. But I, I will miss the shutter button. I'm a little bummed about

251
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:14,165
Speaker 8:  That. Well, and the, the, the light ring thing is a, a big upgrade

252
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:18,005
Speaker 8:  for me because I have one of these, one of the Alexa speakers in my

253
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:21,605
Speaker 8:  kitchen And I can see my kitchen from my bedroom and if someone leaves the

254
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:25,365
Speaker 8:  door open and the Alexa is muted, there's this big

255
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:29,405
Speaker 8:  red glow in my kitchen And I, it's so

256
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:33,045
Speaker 8:  annoying. So I've unplugged it because of that. Whereas now when you mute

257
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:36,885
Speaker 8:  it instead of this huge red glow, it just glows red on the

258
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:40,845
Speaker 8:  little mute button. So they just little quality of life upgrades

259
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:44,365
Speaker 8:  that make the whole thing feel better. But I do have to address the elephant

260
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:46,965
Speaker 8:  in the room because you brought it up with the displays.

261
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:52,765
Speaker 8:  The big problem with Amazon displays to date

262
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,445
Speaker 8:  have been the, the ads people. Yes. And understandably

263
00:16:56,635 --> 00:17:00,405
Speaker 8:  dislike how many ads you do get. The rigid, the current shows

264
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:04,405
Speaker 8:  I get these full screen ads on. Oh it's awful. Not these, not the new ones

265
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:09,005
Speaker 8:  with Alexa plus I've not yet had any,

266
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:13,725
Speaker 8:  but I realize this is in early access. So yeah, that's probably gonna

267
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:16,765
Speaker 5:  Change. And I think there's a, there are a lot of echo show owners who

268
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:20,205
Speaker 5:  were bait and switched by this the first time who are

269
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:25,045
Speaker 5:  I think in a real like, fool me once, shame on you kind of, kind of situation

270
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:25,205
Speaker 5:  here.

271
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:28,965
Speaker 8:  Yes. I mean that and talking to the Amazon execs, ads are not going anywhere.

272
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:33,045
Speaker 8:  They are talking about how they want to, you know, it's more about discovery

273
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:37,325
Speaker 8:  and there's a lot of promoting Amazon products and Amazon services,

274
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:41,525
Speaker 8:  but they're still ads. I mean you get these in the home app now for, you

275
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:45,485
Speaker 8:  know, in Apple, on Apple hardware, there'll be ads for Apple Music. You know,

276
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:49,045
Speaker 8:  it's everywhere. Sure. I'm sure we're gonna start seeing more ads with Alexa.

277
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:52,885
Speaker 8:  Plus they're not there yet. But I'm, I'm not, I wouldn't be surprised

278
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:56,765
Speaker 8:  that they do come, they do change the experience

279
00:17:56,785 --> 00:18:00,565
Speaker 8:  on the display devices. I have not seen, I

280
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:04,405
Speaker 8:  haven't heard the by the way, on Alexa Plus yet, if anyone's not familiar

281
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:08,085
Speaker 8:  with that, this is where on the speakers. 'cause obviously no screen,

282
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:12,125
Speaker 8:  no ads, they will suggest things to you by saying, oh by the way,

283
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,165
Speaker 8:  would you like to buy more toilet paper?

284
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:19,805
Speaker 8:  So that's not arrived yet, but who knows? It's probably coming. I think I

285
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:22,645
Speaker 8:  just wanna say, 'cause I know there's a lot of conversation about this in

286
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:23,885
Speaker 8:  our comment section. Oh yeah.

287
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:29,485
Speaker 8:  So people, people, people, people. You have to pick your poison.

288
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:34,845
Speaker 8:  This is in the smart home with these devices. There are

289
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:38,205
Speaker 8:  trade-offs. It's, it sucks. I wish the perfect

290
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:42,285
Speaker 8:  experience existed. You've got a few options. You go

291
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:46,085
Speaker 8:  with Amazon, which has a lot of hardware, supports

292
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:50,045
Speaker 8:  its hardware, comes out with new hardware, but is probably gonna put ads

293
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,645
Speaker 8:  in your face. Not too expensive though. Quite innovative.

294
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:57,485
Speaker 8:  You've got Google, not a lot of hardware.

295
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:01,725
Speaker 8:  Are they gonna support their hardware? Well yes, but are they going to give

296
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,645
Speaker 8:  you new features and new hardware? Mm hmm.

297
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:10,205
Speaker 8:  Probably. And also Google if you're worried about ads. Yeah. If you're worried

298
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:13,725
Speaker 8:  about privacy, Google, so Apple,

299
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:17,305
Speaker 8:  they may come out with a smart speaker, everyone's waiting, you're gonna

300
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:18,105
Speaker 8:  spend a lot of money

301
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:20,265
Speaker 5:  Also, which it doesn't exist yet.

302
00:19:20,495 --> 00:19:21,705
Speaker 8:  Doesn't exist yet. Yeah.

303
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:23,385
Speaker 5:  Which is part of the problem. Yeah.

304
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:26,825
Speaker 8:  Bigger part of the problem. Yeah. You're gonna, and then the, the, the fourth

305
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:30,425
Speaker 8:  option, obviously roll your own go home assistant use private voice

306
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:34,385
Speaker 8:  assistants, great local, really hard

307
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:38,025
Speaker 8:  to manage buggy as hell. So, you know, you've got to pick

308
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:42,065
Speaker 8:  at the moment, sadly, I would love for something to come along that that

309
00:19:42,065 --> 00:19:46,025
Speaker 8:  ticks all the boxes. But right now, you know, there's, there

310
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,345
Speaker 8:  just isn't the perfect solution. So yeah,

311
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:52,625
Speaker 5:  It's a tricky one. 'cause I think to me the, the by the way thing on

312
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:56,145
Speaker 5:  a speaker is like a horrible dystopian nightmare that I am just utterly unwilling

313
00:19:56,145 --> 00:20:00,105
Speaker 5:  to put up with. Like truly that is, that to me is like an instant non-starter

314
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:04,065
Speaker 5:  for me. I think the onscreen ads bother me less

315
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:07,305
Speaker 5:  than they bother some people. And I think truthfully, a a lot of what I've

316
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:10,665
Speaker 5:  seen in our comments and elsewhere is the sense of, well you didn't have

317
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:13,265
Speaker 5:  this and then I put it in my house and then you put it there. Yeah. And so

318
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:17,185
Speaker 5:  to me it's like, just say you're gonna do ads Amazon, like stop playing

319
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:20,185
Speaker 5:  this game with people where you're like, ha who knows?

320
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:24,465
Speaker 5:  Probably fine. And then once you have a giant install base, you start rolling

321
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:28,025
Speaker 5:  ads on people who can't do anything about it. And this by the way, is Amazon's

322
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:31,905
Speaker 5:  whole mo with everything. They get you signed up for things with the promise

323
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:35,825
Speaker 5:  of nothing and all good things. And then the minute you get attached,

324
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:38,705
Speaker 5:  Amazon starts finding ways to make more money off of you.

325
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:39,105
Speaker 8:  I know.

326
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:40,305
Speaker 5:  Like, that's just what it

327
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:44,185
Speaker 8:  Is. Yeah. I wish they would do a, a version of the Kindle for a, for

328
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:48,165
Speaker 8:  Alexa. Like you pay extra for your Echo show a hundred percent.

329
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,925
Speaker 8:  And you don't get ads just like you can pay extra for a Kindle with no ads.

330
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:51,285
Speaker 8:  But

331
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:53,605
Speaker 5:  The Kindle's a funny example because I always tell people to just get the

332
00:20:53,605 --> 00:20:57,165
Speaker 5:  Kindle with ads because it's not Yeah. The, the light's not on. It's not

333
00:20:57,165 --> 00:21:00,645
Speaker 5:  super annoying. The ads never appear when you're looking at the thing. It's

334
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:04,485
Speaker 5:  just there when they're off. So to me that's like, save the 15 bucks

335
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:08,485
Speaker 5:  or whatever it is and just, just, you'll never even really notice the ads

336
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:11,325
Speaker 5:  in any meaningful way. I think the echo show stuff is a little

337
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:15,925
Speaker 5:  messier because it is like a bright screen blaring ads at

338
00:21:15,925 --> 00:21:19,605
Speaker 5:  you all the time. But that, that I'm,

339
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:22,725
Speaker 5:  it's, it's the beat and switch that bothers me. It's not actually the existence

340
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:26,125
Speaker 5:  of the ads that drives me the most crazy. It's the fact that people put this

341
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,885
Speaker 5:  in their house with no ads and then they did ads. Yeah. That's the thing

342
00:21:29,885 --> 00:21:32,805
Speaker 5:  that feels gross. But I think like you describe all the trade-offs, I would

343
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:36,165
Speaker 5:  handily pick Amazon's version of this. Even if include, even if it includes

344
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:36,485
Speaker 5:  ads

345
00:21:36,735 --> 00:21:40,405
Speaker 8:  Right now, it is definitely the strongest, it has the most legs,

346
00:21:40,515 --> 00:21:44,045
Speaker 8:  most innovation, you know, and Amazon's not, I don't think

347
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:47,005
Speaker 8:  Amazon's backing away from it. We know that they struggled financially in

348
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:50,485
Speaker 8:  this division for a long time, but they've obviously still investing a lot.

349
00:21:51,105 --> 00:21:54,965
Speaker 8:  Google will we'll get to, we'll see what, what's gonna happen

350
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:55,205
Speaker 8:  there.

351
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:58,805
Speaker 5:  Google's once in a decade remembered it has, here it is. Smart home stuff.

352
00:21:58,835 --> 00:21:59,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

353
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:02,565
Speaker 8:  And then Apple obviously is the dark horse. Everyone is waiting to see what

354
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:03,885
Speaker 8:  they're gonna do in this space. So

355
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:08,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So real quick before we get off the, the echo stuff, are you as excited

356
00:22:08,085 --> 00:22:11,885
Speaker 5:  about the dot max as I am? I think the idea of like a hundred dollars, pretty

357
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,765
Speaker 5:  good, relatively good looking. They fixed a bunch of the

358
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:19,605
Speaker 5:  usability stuff like this to me looks like it has a chance

359
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:23,205
Speaker 5:  to be the like default smart speaker that I tell people to get in their house.

360
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:27,485
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I think, I think it's a, it's a really nice piece of equipment.

361
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:31,165
Speaker 8:  It's well designed. It had really good sound. I did get to do a sound demo

362
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:35,325
Speaker 8:  and you know, they were, they're boasting that it's like way better than

363
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:39,245
Speaker 8:  the home board mini definitely more improved. It's

364
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:43,125
Speaker 8:  basically this, it's what it is is it's the echo. If everyone remembers the

365
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:46,125
Speaker 8:  echo speaker, like the flagship echo speaker, that's essentially what this

366
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,725
Speaker 8:  is. It's that same price point too. Okay. Yeah. So even though that

367
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:50,805
Speaker 5:  I thought the tennis ball can sounded pretty good. It was fine.

368
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:52,765
Speaker 8:  It was all right. Yeah. Like a

369
00:22:52,765 --> 00:22:54,645
Speaker 5:  Serviceable decent speaker. But then there

370
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:58,125
Speaker 8:  Was if, then there was the echo fourth gen, which was the big ball,

371
00:22:58,455 --> 00:22:59,085
Speaker 5:  Right? Yeah.

372
00:22:59,355 --> 00:23:03,325
Speaker 8:  That is what, this is really just smaller. So you've still got

373
00:23:03,325 --> 00:23:07,125
Speaker 8:  the dot the DOT's not going away. The original, the the current dot, which

374
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:10,525
Speaker 8:  is the fifth gen, then there's the dot max, which is basically

375
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:13,685
Speaker 8:  what the echo this, it's almost the upgrade of the echo fourth

376
00:23:13,745 --> 00:23:16,005
Speaker 5:  Gen.dot max is such a stupid name.

377
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:17,205
Speaker 8:  I don't like the name. It's,

378
00:23:17,205 --> 00:23:18,805
Speaker 5:  It's the big small one. Yeah. It's nothing.

379
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:21,565
Speaker 8:  I dunno why they didn't just call the Echo Echo.

380
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:22,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah. What are we

381
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:26,285
Speaker 8:  Doing? Yeah, I'm may naming in this space

382
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:29,405
Speaker 8:  has has never been smooth. Agreed. And then the studio,

383
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:33,725
Speaker 8:  the big, which is the big boy. So I think, I think yeah the dot max

384
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:37,725
Speaker 8:  fills I've the echo fourth gen was always my number one re

385
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:41,765
Speaker 8:  pick for a smart speaker if you were gonna get one. And I feel like this

386
00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:45,525
Speaker 8:  just fills that spot. The nice thing, although this is technically a dot,

387
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:49,925
Speaker 8:  is it's the first.to have all the smart home radios. So it's a

388
00:23:49,925 --> 00:23:53,285
Speaker 8:  thread border router, it's a matter controller and it has ZigBee. So

389
00:23:53,755 --> 00:23:57,405
Speaker 8:  they're really going all in on the smart home side for all of the smart

390
00:23:57,405 --> 00:24:01,245
Speaker 8:  speakers. So yeah, dot dot max if you are interested in

391
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:06,215
Speaker 8:  adding a new smart speaker to your home that uses Alexa, I

392
00:24:06,215 --> 00:24:09,815
Speaker 8:  would definitely say based on what we've seen so far, that's the winner.

393
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:14,375
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think that is like a, a kitchen speaker is gonna be a pretty big

394
00:24:14,395 --> 00:24:15,295
Speaker 5:  win for a lot of people.

395
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:18,975
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And you can do two and get stereo sound and Yeah, it's got, and then

396
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:22,895
Speaker 8:  you can also put five together and do a home theater. But we could

397
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,135
Speaker 8:  talk about that later. We,

398
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:27,935
Speaker 5:  We, we should talk about that later. So the, the, the sort of

399
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:31,735
Speaker 5:  underpinning of all of this is Alexa plus, which is still, if I'm

400
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:35,135
Speaker 5:  understanding correctly, in early access, this is Amazon's like

401
00:24:35,495 --> 00:24:39,175
Speaker 5:  LLM powered futuristic Alexa that you And I were at the launch of

402
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:43,495
Speaker 5:  65 years ago now under an entirely different regime.

403
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,335
Speaker 5:  The world was like just insane. But anyway,

404
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:51,855
Speaker 5:  it's still technically an early access, but it's shipping by default on

405
00:24:51,855 --> 00:24:54,975
Speaker 5:  these new devices. So it both is and is not

406
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:56,655
Speaker 5:  fully launched.

407
00:24:56,655 --> 00:25:00,575
Speaker 8:  Yeah, it's confusing. Yeah. So what's going, so it's

408
00:25:00,655 --> 00:25:03,815
Speaker 8:  shipping by default on these new devices in the US and Canada. Okay. These

409
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:07,615
Speaker 8:  new devices are shipping to lots of countries, but if you're not in the US

410
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:11,415
Speaker 8:  and Canada, you don't get Alexa Plus when it, when it comes outta the box,

411
00:25:11,415 --> 00:25:14,855
Speaker 8:  you'll just get the option when you're setting it up. I've been told to just

412
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:18,575
Speaker 8:  say yes I want Alexa plus. I see. So if you don't do that,

413
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:22,615
Speaker 8:  you'll have regular, regular old Alexa. You can click yes,

414
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:26,255
Speaker 8:  you get Alexa plus you don't have to sign up, but it is Alexa

415
00:25:26,365 --> 00:25:30,175
Speaker 8:  plus in early access and that moniker is basically, it's still in

416
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:33,975
Speaker 8:  better and there are bugs and it may not work exactly as

417
00:25:34,135 --> 00:25:37,975
Speaker 8:  intended and some features don't work at all. So Yes.

418
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:41,975
Speaker 8:  And then in terms of for everyone else that has devices, if

419
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:45,485
Speaker 8:  they want Alexa plus you do still have to

420
00:25:45,955 --> 00:25:49,925
Speaker 8:  sign up to for early access and wait for an invitation. But I

421
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:53,525
Speaker 8:  am told that the waiting period is gonna go away

422
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:57,325
Speaker 8:  really soon. But it'll still be an early access in terms

423
00:25:57,325 --> 00:26:01,205
Speaker 8:  of Alexa Plus is now here and for everyone that's

424
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:05,405
Speaker 8:  on the horizon still. I see. I think they feel like there's still a lot

425
00:26:05,555 --> 00:26:09,205
Speaker 8:  that they need to work on because many of the features they announced in

426
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:13,165
Speaker 8:  February still aren't live. They demoed some of them

427
00:26:13,175 --> 00:26:16,805
Speaker 8:  again This week, but again said coming

428
00:26:16,995 --> 00:26:20,845
Speaker 8:  soon. Yeah. So yeah, a lot is still sort of hinged

429
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,605
Speaker 8:  on rolling out what they've promised. Interestingly,

430
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:28,605
Speaker 8:  they have announced that they are bringing, they announced This week

431
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:32,205
Speaker 8:  that, that it is coming to third party speakers. So that's as question I've

432
00:26:32,205 --> 00:26:36,005
Speaker 8:  been asked a lot because you know, Alexa is on like Sonos and Bose

433
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:39,765
Speaker 8:  and other speakers and that is something that is is coming but again

434
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:43,530
Speaker 8:  coming soon. So there's just, yeah, it's, it's gonna gonna take a while

435
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,845
Speaker 8:  until we see this everywhere.

436
00:26:45,505 --> 00:26:49,285
Speaker 5:  You've been using Alexa plus for a long time. Is it, is it at or

437
00:26:49,285 --> 00:26:52,845
Speaker 5:  even nearing the point where it's like worth leaping for new hardware to

438
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:53,125
Speaker 5:  get it?

439
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:58,205
Speaker 8:  Yes, depending on your use case. It, it is, we should mention

440
00:26:58,585 --> 00:27:02,365
Speaker 8:  $20 a month once it's out of early access. Although

441
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:06,325
Speaker 8:  right now it's free and then if you get Prime you'll

442
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:09,325
Speaker 8:  also get it for free, which is kind of weird 'cause that's what, $15 a month.

443
00:27:10,305 --> 00:27:11,565
Speaker 8:  So we'll see how that pans out.

444
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:14,405
Speaker 5:  Amazon would very much like you to get Prime. Yes. It's like, but also if

445
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:18,085
Speaker 5:  you, if you don't have a prime account, but you have an Alexa speaker, I

446
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:21,725
Speaker 5:  have a bunch of questions Yes. About like your your Life choices subscription

447
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:25,365
Speaker 5:  decisions. Yeah. So I think, I think you, we can fairly safely assume that

448
00:27:25,365 --> 00:27:28,405
Speaker 5:  most people who have these things are going to have a prime account and thus

449
00:27:28,405 --> 00:27:30,765
Speaker 5:  you're gonna get free will eventually get Alexa plus for free. And so I think

450
00:27:31,155 --> 00:27:33,725
Speaker 5:  this is kind of the thing right, is to me these are

451
00:27:35,085 --> 00:27:38,525
Speaker 5:  slightly better versions of the existing things, which is like

452
00:27:39,175 --> 00:27:42,965
Speaker 5:  great, right? As as a way to, if you, if you just assume most people's

453
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:46,925
Speaker 5:  smart speaker experience is basic smart home stuff, music and timers. Yeah.

454
00:27:46,925 --> 00:27:50,405
Speaker 5:  Which is what it's like that that is, that is statistically speaking how

455
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:51,725
Speaker 5:  most people do smart speakers.

456
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,725
Speaker 5:  These things are going to be slightly better hardware but not like huge new

457
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:58,525
Speaker 5:  ideas. The huge new idea is Alexa Plus

458
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:02,245
Speaker 8:  Is Alexa plus and it is better, much better than the old Alexa. Like

459
00:28:02,595 --> 00:28:03,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Even now.

460
00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:07,645
Speaker 8:  Oh yes, yes. Okay. This makes me happy. So you, yeah, you can talk to it

461
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:11,285
Speaker 8:  naturally. Natural language is just a game changer

462
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:14,445
Speaker 8:  for smart speakers. The problem is, And I think the reason why a lot of people

463
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:18,645
Speaker 8:  complain about that I've seen complaining about Alexa Plus is we've trained

464
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:22,605
Speaker 8:  ourselves how to talk to these devices. Oh, totally. And the

465
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:25,405
Speaker 8:  new versions don't really understand that language.

466
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:26,805
Speaker 5:  They Oh, interesting.

467
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:30,805
Speaker 8:  You need to talk to them. Like you would just talk to a person. They're not

468
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:34,525
Speaker 8:  designed to be deterministic, they're not designed to follow a pattern.

469
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:39,085
Speaker 8:  So when you say, you know, a turn on the light in

470
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:42,925
Speaker 8:  the living room to 50%, it'll be like, I mean

471
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:46,765
Speaker 8:  it might do it, but it's, it's less if you say,

472
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:51,165
Speaker 8:  hey, a make it brighter in here, oh, a bit more.

473
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:55,245
Speaker 8:  Okay, bring it down a little, it'll do all of that. That's so much easier

474
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,525
Speaker 8:  than the, the previous way. It's just, we're so used to saying the first

475
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:02,485
Speaker 8:  way. And so some of those issues I think when people have

476
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:06,165
Speaker 8:  just been using these devices for a long time and they, they've trained themselves

477
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:10,245
Speaker 8:  how to do it. So you do have to rethink the way you communicate with them.

478
00:29:10,305 --> 00:29:14,285
Speaker 8:  But once you do that, it is a big change. And I've actually

479
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:18,165
Speaker 8:  found that, you know, my family uses it more now because they never trained

480
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:21,685
Speaker 8:  themselves. They just relied on me to do it. But because you can literally

481
00:29:21,685 --> 00:29:25,325
Speaker 8:  just say what you want it to do and it mostly will do it, it makes a huge

482
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:28,485
Speaker 8:  difference. It's also easier. It's knows a lot more.

483
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:33,045
Speaker 8:  The old Alexa used to always, you know, say, I am not

484
00:29:33,045 --> 00:29:36,845
Speaker 8:  sure about that or sorry, I can't help with that if you asked more

485
00:29:36,845 --> 00:29:40,685
Speaker 8:  intricate questions or more specifics. But like the other day, my

486
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:43,845
Speaker 8:  husband was very jealous. I was coming to New York and he was like, oh, I

487
00:29:43,845 --> 00:29:47,605
Speaker 8:  heard about this great play, it stars the girl from Dexter

488
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:51,405
Speaker 8:  that we really liked. You should go see it. And I was like, what play is

489
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:53,365
Speaker 8:  it? And he's like, I can't remember. And I said, well let's, why don't we

490
00:29:53,365 --> 00:29:57,045
Speaker 8:  ask Alexa? And so he said, Hey what? And he tried to explain,

491
00:29:57,185 --> 00:30:01,125
Speaker 8:  he said, well exactly what he said to me. And it came back and came up with

492
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:03,605
Speaker 8:  the name of the play. I think it's like the Great Americans or something

493
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:06,245
Speaker 8:  I've forgotten, but came up with the name of the play, said where it's playing

494
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:09,005
Speaker 8:  when it's playing. You know, the old Alexa would never have been able to

495
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:12,885
Speaker 8:  do that. Right. So that kind of stuff is great. I, a lot

496
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:16,765
Speaker 8:  of the, the more agentic capabilities, which I tested a while back, I

497
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:20,045
Speaker 8:  haven't tested again recently. Those were a little hit or miss.

498
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:24,645
Speaker 8:  I also don't find much use for them. I could just as easily get my phone

499
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:28,365
Speaker 8:  out. Yeah. The recipe stuff is so good.

500
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:31,805
Speaker 8:  Like using a smart display in the kitchen is like for me the number one use

501
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:35,685
Speaker 8:  case. And you can now like snap a picture of a recipe, send it

502
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:39,625
Speaker 8:  to Alexa and it will break it out

503
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:43,545
Speaker 8:  into a format for you with the ingredients, the steps. It will talk you through

504
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:46,665
Speaker 8:  it. You can say, hey what, what was the temperature I needed to set it for

505
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:50,025
Speaker 8:  for the oven? And just go back and forth while you're walking around your

506
00:30:50,025 --> 00:30:52,825
Speaker 8:  kitchen. That experience so much better. That's

507
00:30:52,825 --> 00:30:56,665
Speaker 5:  The stuff, right? Like that to me is where you go the all the agentic stuff

508
00:30:56,665 --> 00:31:00,305
Speaker 5:  is like fine and interesting And I think like a long way off from actually

509
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:03,105
Speaker 5:  being relevant to anybody. But like if I can just do all of the things that

510
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:07,065
Speaker 5:  it seems natural that my Alexa device should do. Yeah. That's

511
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,025
Speaker 5:  the stuff. And I think especially with the smart home stuff, like you And

512
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:12,385
Speaker 5:  I haveve been talking about this forever. Like I just, no one will ever convince

513
00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:16,345
Speaker 5:  me that having to remember the names of my lamps is a thing that

514
00:31:16,345 --> 00:31:17,025
Speaker 5:  I need to do. Something

515
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:18,225
Speaker 8:  You need to do. And

516
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:22,185
Speaker 5:  So like how, what I have and and remembering to say brightness 60% is

517
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:26,105
Speaker 5:  like insane. No, yeah, I will not do that. But this this change

518
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:28,145
Speaker 5:  you're describing where it's like just, it just like a little brighter but

519
00:31:28,145 --> 00:31:31,985
Speaker 5:  not too bright and it actually knows what to do. Yeah. That that matters.

520
00:31:32,385 --> 00:31:35,505
Speaker 5:  That's, that's a real switch in what it means to actually use this stuff

521
00:31:35,505 --> 00:31:36,105
Speaker 5:  inside your house.

522
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:40,265
Speaker 8:  And you can set up a routine for something like that by just saying, oh you

523
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:44,065
Speaker 8:  know, Alexa, I can you please actually I, I feel like

524
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:47,585
Speaker 8:  it's gonna be really cold tomorrow. Can you make sure to set the temperature,

525
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:50,465
Speaker 8:  change the temperature in the afternoon after the kids get home? Like you

526
00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:53,865
Speaker 8:  can go back and forth about things you want to happen in your home that you

527
00:31:53,865 --> 00:31:56,785
Speaker 8:  would maybe just think in your head about and then think, oh I should sit

528
00:31:56,785 --> 00:32:00,345
Speaker 8:  down and program it into my app. But instead of doing that, you just spew

529
00:32:00,345 --> 00:32:04,225
Speaker 8:  it all out and she sets up a T it sets up, sorry, I've been hanging out

530
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:08,145
Speaker 8:  with Amazon people too long. It sets up a routine for you. You can go

531
00:32:08,145 --> 00:32:11,265
Speaker 8:  and change it in the app or you can talk to it and change it. Say actually

532
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:14,265
Speaker 8:  no I don't want it to happen at four. Can you make it happen at five and

533
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,745
Speaker 8:  it adapts and changes. So that kind of stuff really is game changer,

534
00:32:18,255 --> 00:32:21,985
Speaker 8:  game changing for the smart home. But the thing about the smart home

535
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:26,025
Speaker 8:  Alexa that I should just mention before we wrap up is it's not always

536
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,905
Speaker 8:  re reliable, which is a bit of a problem, especially in

537
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:34,385
Speaker 8:  the smoke minor detail in the Yeah. In the smart home. And this is down to

538
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,545
Speaker 8:  the technology and this is something that I'm assuming is gonna be a problem

539
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:40,725
Speaker 8:  for all of these systems and I've been doing a bit of digging

540
00:32:41,715 --> 00:32:45,245
Speaker 8:  into this and basically what it is, as we know

541
00:32:45,635 --> 00:32:48,765
Speaker 8:  LLMs are not deterministic, right? They are

542
00:32:50,695 --> 00:32:54,495
Speaker 8:  designed to be creative, like designed to be you ask chat

543
00:32:54,615 --> 00:32:57,935
Speaker 8:  TP TA question and then ask the same question again and you get a different

544
00:32:58,175 --> 00:33:02,135
Speaker 8:  response in the smart home, if you ask your smart assistant

545
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:04,895
Speaker 8:  to turn on the lights, you want it to do that every time.

546
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:10,255
Speaker 8:  And sometimes, depending on how you phrase it, it may misinterpret what

547
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,375
Speaker 8:  you're asking. May not realize you're talking about the smart home might

548
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:16,335
Speaker 8:  think you're talking about traffic lights. I dunno. It could come up

549
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:20,055
Speaker 8:  with some other perspective and then forget or not

550
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:24,135
Speaker 8:  send the command to the APIs or the smart home

551
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,855
Speaker 8:  devices that it's trying to communicate with. And where that breakdown happens.

552
00:33:28,355 --> 00:33:30,975
Speaker 8:  That's where things, And I think a lot of people who have been using the

553
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:34,815
Speaker 8:  smart home with Alexa for a long time and now use

554
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:38,295
Speaker 8:  Alexa plus. So like it's ruined my smart home. These things aren't working

555
00:33:38,295 --> 00:33:41,735
Speaker 8:  anymore And I have had to rebuild a few routines

556
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:45,575
Speaker 8:  because they don't work anymore because the new Alexa doesn't understand

557
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:49,215
Speaker 8:  them. So yeah, there's, there's a friction there that, that talking to the,

558
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:53,775
Speaker 8:  to panelist penne This week about it, he said, you know, that is the problem

559
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:57,535
Speaker 8:  that we are working on now. That is one of the reasons why Alexa plus

560
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:01,575
Speaker 8:  is in early access because we need more and more people to be experiencing

561
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:05,055
Speaker 8:  these sort of breakdowns in handoff between the

562
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:09,255
Speaker 8:  LLMs and the more deterministic models so that we can figure out how to fix

563
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:13,135
Speaker 8:  that. But he was very sort of saying, well, we're the only ones that

564
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,975
Speaker 8:  are doing this at all right now, so, which

565
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:20,855
Speaker 8:  is fair enough. We'll see what Google's experience is like now that that's

566
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:24,415
Speaker 8:  launching. But yeah, that, that is the problem. And this is probably why

567
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:28,055
Speaker 8:  Apple is still not in the game because you know Siri

568
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:32,335
Speaker 8:  for all she, he it isn't great does still

569
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:35,735
Speaker 8:  turn the lights on every time you ask it to. Yeah. So this, that kind of

570
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:39,535
Speaker 8:  stuff is still being worked out and whether it's going, whether they're gonna

571
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,135
Speaker 8:  be able to find a, a good solution or not, we're just gonna have to wait

572
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:42,375
Speaker 8:  and see.

573
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:46,575
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That trade between, it does a lot of things kind of

574
00:34:46,575 --> 00:34:49,855
Speaker 5:  well and it does a tiny number of things really reliably

575
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:54,615
Speaker 5:  is the big challenge with all of this stuff right now. Because the, the ceiling

576
00:34:55,555 --> 00:34:59,415
Speaker 5:  for all of this LLM based stuff is so much higher. There's new things it

577
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:02,655
Speaker 5:  can do. It works new ways. The floor is so much lower because it will make

578
00:35:02,655 --> 00:35:06,575
Speaker 5:  dumb mistakes all the time that like you can just program Siri

579
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:10,055
Speaker 5:  with an if then statement that will work most of the time, right? Yes. And

580
00:35:10,055 --> 00:35:13,975
Speaker 5:  it's like you can't do anything else. Siri sucks at everything. That is not

581
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:18,095
Speaker 5:  a very basic if then statement. Yeah. But it does the if then statements

582
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:20,215
Speaker 8:  And it doesn't. Right. It does.

583
00:35:20,355 --> 00:35:20,775
Speaker 5:  And that's

584
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:22,295
Speaker 8:  Something but it doesn't think of talking about something else.

585
00:35:23,525 --> 00:35:27,335
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Except for now, like anyway, I'm very mad at Apple reminders right

586
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:29,895
Speaker 5:  now because sir is so bad. But that's a whole different story.

587
00:35:31,575 --> 00:35:34,455
Speaker 5:  I want to switch gears to talk about Google here a little bit, but the, the

588
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:36,975
Speaker 5:  last Amazon device we should talk about. There's lots more stuff. There's

589
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,285
Speaker 5:  ring stuff, there's Blink stuff, there's a million new cameras. I don't go

590
00:35:40,285 --> 00:35:43,645
Speaker 5:  read all of Jen's stories about them. There's thousands of them. I do wanna

591
00:35:43,645 --> 00:35:46,085
Speaker 5:  talk about the new Kindle scribe just for a minute because I think Yeah.

592
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:46,965
Speaker 8:  Oh so pretty.

593
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:51,085
Speaker 5:  So, okay, so I got, I got a virtual briefing of this. Todd Hazelton on our

594
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:53,565
Speaker 5:  team went and actually saw the thing before it launched. You saw the thing

595
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:57,405
Speaker 5:  at the event. I think this might be very exciting. Mm.

596
00:35:57,435 --> 00:36:01,325
Speaker 5:  It's expensive, particularly the new Kindle scribe Color Soft,

597
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,685
Speaker 5:  which is 630 bucks. But you can get a Kindle scribe

598
00:36:05,145 --> 00:36:08,325
Speaker 5:  for 430 bucks. It doesn't have a front light. The real one they want you

599
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:12,165
Speaker 5:  to buy is I think 4 99. But the the basic

600
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:15,965
Speaker 5:  new thing is it's thinner, it's lighter, it, it works

601
00:36:16,065 --> 00:36:18,525
Speaker 5:  better in all of the ways. You would hope the second generation would work

602
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:22,325
Speaker 5:  better, lower latency, faster it in, it integrates with

603
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:25,125
Speaker 5:  OneDrive and Google Drive. So it'll do some like productivity stuff a lot

604
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:28,885
Speaker 5:  better. This like, seems like a, a paper

605
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:33,205
Speaker 5:  notebook competitor in a, in a real useful, interesting way. You've

606
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:37,225
Speaker 5:  actually like held and touched and seen the thing. Is it, is it,

607
00:36:37,225 --> 00:36:38,385
Speaker 5:  does it look great? Is it great?

608
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:41,785
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I, I mean I've not, I've, I have a Kindle from

609
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:45,905
Speaker 8:  maybe a decade ago, so I've not been like really

610
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,945
Speaker 8:  the front of technology when it comes to changing my Kindle. And I think

611
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:53,465
Speaker 8:  a lot of people don't because you know, it is such a great device. Yeah.

612
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:56,145
Speaker 8:  And you read your book like how much more do you need to do this?

613
00:36:56,205 --> 00:36:58,545
Speaker 5:  You just described the best and worst thing about the Kindle line Yes. Is

614
00:36:58,545 --> 00:37:01,025
Speaker 5:  they can't figure out how to make any money because every bought a really

615
00:37:01,025 --> 00:37:03,225
Speaker 5:  good Kindle 10 years ago and has no need to.

616
00:37:03,885 --> 00:37:07,865
Speaker 8:  But this feels like as a sort of step forward for the device in terms

617
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:11,745
Speaker 8:  of actually becoming a paper replacement,

618
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:15,185
Speaker 8:  a notepad replacement. And I think when I was, I mean I was live blogging

619
00:37:15,185 --> 00:37:18,945
Speaker 8:  the event And I, I said actually I've always been a pen and paper girl.

620
00:37:19,105 --> 00:37:22,265
Speaker 8:  I use a physical notepad, but I really like the idea of this.

621
00:37:22,985 --> 00:37:26,265
Speaker 8:  I could really like the fact that it just, and Pan os pane was showing up

622
00:37:26,265 --> 00:37:30,145
Speaker 8:  on screen on stage and he was saying it's like milliseconds of latency,

623
00:37:30,145 --> 00:37:32,985
Speaker 8:  you know, you really won't notice. It's really easy to write. 'cause that's

624
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:36,545
Speaker 8:  been one of my other problems is I tried to use an iPad with a pen and it

625
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:40,465
Speaker 8:  just wasn't intuitive. He was kind of cradling this thing. I mean he

626
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:43,065
Speaker 8:  was, I think this was the thing he was most excited about. Panos

627
00:37:43,065 --> 00:37:46,945
Speaker 5:  Is like famously a long-term believer in handwriting on

628
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:50,785
Speaker 5:  device, like all the way back to like killed Microsoft devices. Like that

629
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:53,785
Speaker 5:  that man loves a digital writing experience.

630
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:57,505
Speaker 8:  Oh yeah. He seemed like this sort of seemed really, really exciting

631
00:37:57,565 --> 00:38:00,705
Speaker 8:  for him. I think he was more excited about these than the shows honestly.

632
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:04,705
Speaker 8:  But, but yeah, it was, I mean I, my daughter

633
00:38:04,805 --> 00:38:07,985
Speaker 8:  is an artist And I've been desperately trying to find a good

634
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:12,505
Speaker 8:  sort of tablet for her that's not an iPad because iPads are

635
00:38:12,505 --> 00:38:16,145
Speaker 8:  kind of heavy. I mean they really are for writing. You were used to doing

636
00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:19,625
Speaker 8:  it on a, a a, a nice notepad with a pencil and they're

637
00:38:19,825 --> 00:38:23,705
Speaker 8:  distracting. And what's nice about this, I think, you know, if you can create,

638
00:38:23,965 --> 00:38:27,505
Speaker 8:  if you can create this experience that's just your notes and just your books

639
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:31,505
Speaker 8:  and just your sketches, But that you can get material in and out

640
00:38:31,505 --> 00:38:35,490
Speaker 8:  of, I mean I, I remember, I'm sure it's better now, but sort of trying

641
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,765
Speaker 8:  to send articles to my Kindle through Instapaper way back when.

642
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:40,685
Speaker 8:  Oh yes. But this seems like

643
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,245
Speaker 5:  A, it's not better by the way. Oh, okay. Not better. That's

644
00:38:43,245 --> 00:38:47,165
Speaker 8:  Sad to hear. So I, I mean as a, a reading

645
00:38:47,345 --> 00:38:51,125
Speaker 8:  and drawing and somewhat content creation device that isn't a

646
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:55,165
Speaker 8:  bright screen that isn't distracting. I know there are other EAN

647
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:58,565
Speaker 8:  tablets out there that are kind of trying to do this as well, but obviously

648
00:38:58,585 --> 00:39:02,405
Speaker 8:  Kindle has that lock-in with your books and Yeah,

649
00:39:02,485 --> 00:39:06,365
Speaker 8:  I, I'm very, I was very impressed with this and very tempted not,

650
00:39:06,365 --> 00:39:10,325
Speaker 8:  maybe not for, well maybe for me, but definitely for my daughter. It's

651
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:12,725
Speaker 8:  easier to spend $600 on her than on me. So

652
00:39:13,355 --> 00:39:16,525
Speaker 5:  This is one of those things that I think the price to me is the only thing

653
00:39:16,525 --> 00:39:20,245
Speaker 5:  that kills me. Yeah. It's a lot like, it's, it's a lot of money for this

654
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:24,085
Speaker 5:  specific thing And I think it, it is inching closer

655
00:39:24,265 --> 00:39:26,925
Speaker 5:  to being what I want it to be. Like. I think color's a big deal And I think

656
00:39:26,925 --> 00:39:30,805
Speaker 5:  there are a lot of people who will see this as the big color

657
00:39:30,945 --> 00:39:34,765
Speaker 5:  Kindle and we'll want it for that reason alone. Right. Like as a, if, if

658
00:39:34,765 --> 00:39:37,645
Speaker 5:  you're reading comic books, when the first color soft came out, the main

659
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:40,125
Speaker 5:  feedback I saw was from people being like this, this looks great, I want

660
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:42,645
Speaker 5:  a bigger one. Yeah. Well the first feedback was why is the screen yellow?

661
00:39:42,705 --> 00:39:46,405
Speaker 5:  But then they fixed that and, and then the feedback was why isn't this

662
00:39:46,405 --> 00:39:50,365
Speaker 5:  bigger? And I think this is gonna be exciting to a lot of those people.

663
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:55,085
Speaker 5:  It's just $630. And so I think the, the next phase of this is like,

664
00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:58,125
Speaker 5:  okay, let's take this stuff and bring it down towards regular Kindle prices

665
00:39:58,585 --> 00:39:59,845
Speaker 5:  and we'll be really onto something.

666
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:03,565
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Well and this goes along with the, the shows and the dots and because,

667
00:40:04,105 --> 00:40:08,085
Speaker 8:  you know, everything has got more expensive, but it also has got

668
00:40:08,085 --> 00:40:11,845
Speaker 8:  better. So there's that trade off again. Like we want the more premium

669
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:16,085
Speaker 8:  experience. Yeah. Right now it's too, it's maybe

670
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:19,965
Speaker 8:  more or too expensive in some cases, but as we've seen the trend

671
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:22,605
Speaker 8:  normally will be in two or three years, hopefully some of this technology

672
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:26,125
Speaker 8:  will get cheaper and, and we'll get the, you know, the first gen of these

673
00:40:26,275 --> 00:40:30,245
Speaker 8:  devices are always gonna be a little, I mean the original color, like

674
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:34,125
Speaker 8:  Kindle Oasis wasn't that like one of the first big redesigns that was quite

675
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,405
Speaker 8:  expensive and that's now much more affordable.

676
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:39,165
Speaker 5:  So yeah, it's, it's, Amazon does have a pretty good track record of sort

677
00:40:39,165 --> 00:40:42,005
Speaker 5:  of pulling this stuff down the lineup over time. Yeah. And I will probably

678
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:45,525
Speaker 5:  been waiting for that one. Real quick, before we take a break,

679
00:40:45,935 --> 00:40:49,605
Speaker 5:  we're gonna talk a lot about Google's smart home strategy for

680
00:40:49,675 --> 00:40:53,285
Speaker 5:  next Tuesday's show. But there was some news This week, Google

681
00:40:53,905 --> 00:40:57,885
Speaker 5:  as it does every once in a while, completely changed its mind about everything,

682
00:40:57,885 --> 00:40:59,205
Speaker 5:  about how its smart home strategy works.

683
00:41:00,915 --> 00:41:04,605
Speaker 5:  Just give me sort of the, the top line news. All I know is I saw a picture

684
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:07,685
Speaker 5:  of a red speaker that I immediately was like, that is the best looking smart

685
00:41:07,685 --> 00:41:11,565
Speaker 5:  speaker I have ever seen in my entire life. It's very pretty. But inside

686
00:41:11,565 --> 00:41:15,525
Speaker 5:  that speaker, Google seems to have like, kind of changed its whole smart

687
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:16,805
Speaker 5:  home strategy. What is happening here?

688
00:41:17,345 --> 00:41:21,045
Speaker 8:  Yes. So the, the sort of top line is Google is

689
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:25,165
Speaker 8:  relaunching, its Google Home under, well it's still called Google

690
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:28,405
Speaker 8:  Home, but Gemini for home is sort of the overarching

691
00:41:29,065 --> 00:41:33,005
Speaker 8:  theory. Now it's, it's similar to what Alexa Plus is doing for

692
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:36,365
Speaker 8:  Amazon, but it's Gemini for home is infusing

693
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:40,445
Speaker 8:  Gemini AI throughout the smart home lineup

694
00:41:40,905 --> 00:41:44,685
Speaker 8:  and to partner products as well. So products developed by other

695
00:41:44,685 --> 00:41:48,485
Speaker 8:  manufacturers for Google Home. So what this is, is that

696
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:52,325
Speaker 8:  the Google assistant on the smart speakers and smart displays

697
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:56,525
Speaker 8:  is gonna be replaced by Gemini. That's already sort of happened. Or you can,

698
00:41:56,585 --> 00:42:00,485
Speaker 8:  you can get access to Gemini features, but this is now

699
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:04,485
Speaker 8:  a complete wholesale shift that's actually gonna be

700
00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:07,925
Speaker 8:  available in an early access program.

701
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:11,925
Speaker 8:  Another one of those for anyone starting on

702
00:42:11,925 --> 00:42:15,205
Speaker 8:  October 1st, which was Wednesday, which is actually today. But if you're

703
00:42:15,205 --> 00:42:17,645
Speaker 8:  listening to this on Friday time

704
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:18,405
Speaker 5:  Travel time

705
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:22,165
Speaker 8:  Travel. So you can sign up for this in your Google

706
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,565
Speaker 8:  Home app. You don't have to be in the public preview program or anything.

707
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:28,645
Speaker 8:  And you can use Gemini instead of Google Assistant on all of

708
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:32,405
Speaker 8:  Google Home hardware going all the way back to the original

709
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:36,405
Speaker 8:  Flower Pot looking one. Oh yeah, in 2016.

710
00:42:36,645 --> 00:42:38,765
Speaker 5:  I still had that thing around here somewhere. You do? Oh you I loved that

711
00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:40,245
Speaker 5:  it, I thought it was great looking.

712
00:42:40,395 --> 00:42:43,365
Speaker 8:  Yeah. See if, see see what it, how it runs on there. It's

713
00:42:43,365 --> 00:42:47,085
Speaker 5:  Still, I think that original Google Home speaker

714
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:50,925
Speaker 5:  I think was the least speaker looking smart speaker

715
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:54,765
Speaker 5:  anyone has made And I loved it for that. It just looked like a little like

716
00:42:54,965 --> 00:42:57,965
Speaker 5:  tchotchke on your table. Yeah. In a, in a way that it like, I wish more of

717
00:42:57,965 --> 00:42:58,685
Speaker 5:  these smart speakers

718
00:42:58,865 --> 00:43:02,085
Speaker 8:  And Google's being very good. Google's definitely led the way on the design

719
00:43:02,085 --> 00:43:05,885
Speaker 8:  front for these smart devices. The Nest Mini was,

720
00:43:05,905 --> 00:43:09,485
Speaker 8:  was nice as well. It was small and easy to sort of tuck away and they made

721
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:12,125
Speaker 8:  it so you could like mount it on the wall, which was always, which was kind

722
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:15,805
Speaker 8:  of neat. And these new, the new one, so go the Google Home

723
00:43:15,805 --> 00:43:19,725
Speaker 8:  speaker, they're getting rid of the Nest name that's now just

724
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:20,205
Speaker 8:  for cameras.

725
00:43:20,885 --> 00:43:24,765
Speaker 5:  I hate this. I don't like, we, we don't need to dwell

726
00:43:24,765 --> 00:43:28,365
Speaker 5:  on this for too long, but I, I think Nest is a, a terrific brand

727
00:43:28,785 --> 00:43:32,285
Speaker 5:  and B, a brand that a lot of people know and have known for like the Nest

728
00:43:32,285 --> 00:43:36,165
Speaker 5:  thermostat is so like iconic a thing in the like

729
00:43:36,345 --> 00:43:38,125
Speaker 5:  Annals of Smart home history. Yeah.

730
00:43:38,435 --> 00:43:38,725
Speaker 8:  That

731
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:42,605
Speaker 5:  It just seems weird, especially to turn it into this branding mush where

732
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:46,045
Speaker 5:  Nest still exists, but now Google Home exists and Gemini at home exists.

733
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:47,605
Speaker 5:  Just, it was

734
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:48,765
Speaker 8:  Nest Pick a name, just call it

735
00:43:48,765 --> 00:43:49,925
Speaker 5:  Nest, what are we doing?

736
00:43:50,915 --> 00:43:54,765
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I know. Well so yeah, it's Nest is still on the cameras and obviously

737
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:58,205
Speaker 8:  on the thermostat, but as I wrote about a couple weeks ago, nest

738
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:02,245
Speaker 8:  Google is very much got gotten out of the Nest hardware game. Yes.

739
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:05,805
Speaker 8:  So the speaker, the speakers were originally Google.

740
00:44:06,505 --> 00:44:10,005
Speaker 8:  So Google Home Speaker was the first speaker, then they made them Nest

741
00:44:10,345 --> 00:44:12,685
Speaker 8:  and now they're going back to Google. So

742
00:44:13,035 --> 00:44:15,685
Speaker 5:  They're gonna be Fitbit in six months. Like this is just what Google does.

743
00:44:15,915 --> 00:44:17,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Drives

744
00:44:17,045 --> 00:44:20,925
Speaker 8:  You crazy. The camera's a nest, the thermostat's nest. But the app,

745
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:24,565
Speaker 8:  there was also a Nest app. You can still use the Nest app, but now everything's

746
00:44:24,565 --> 00:44:27,765
Speaker 8:  gone. Now everything is in the Google Home app. You can use, you can even

747
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:31,325
Speaker 8:  set passcodes for your Nest X

748
00:44:31,715 --> 00:44:34,565
Speaker 8:  lock, which I know is something that many of our readers are very keen to

749
00:44:34,565 --> 00:44:38,485
Speaker 8:  be able to do. So this one's for you, you can now do that in the Google Home

750
00:44:38,505 --> 00:44:42,485
Speaker 8:  app. But the other in the Nest as a

751
00:44:42,495 --> 00:44:45,685
Speaker 8:  whole is now very much just sort of a subset because they got rid of the

752
00:44:45,685 --> 00:44:49,325
Speaker 8:  Nest Protect, they got rid of the Nest, secure. Any other, the

753
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:53,645
Speaker 8:  Nestl, Yale Lock, all that Nest branding has gone, those products have gone

754
00:44:53,645 --> 00:44:57,205
Speaker 8:  because Google is basically saying we're only making the flagship products

755
00:44:57,205 --> 00:45:00,445
Speaker 8:  that make sense for our Gemini Smart Home

756
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:05,085
Speaker 8:  speakers. Cameras, they haven't mentioned the thermostat, but they did

757
00:45:05,085 --> 00:45:08,805
Speaker 8:  just update that quite recently. Yeah. And then they're moving towards

758
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:12,405
Speaker 8:  partners. They just announced This week Walmart,

759
00:45:12,825 --> 00:45:16,685
Speaker 8:  the On Brandand has new cameras that work with Google

760
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:20,245
Speaker 8:  Home. There's, there was a post This week from the

761
00:45:20,245 --> 00:45:23,845
Speaker 8:  developer blog saying, you know, we're opening up all this Gemini

762
00:45:23,845 --> 00:45:27,525
Speaker 8:  intelligence to anyone that wants to partner with Google Home

763
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:31,765
Speaker 8:  to developed products for the platform. So the outta the

764
00:45:31,925 --> 00:45:35,885
Speaker 8:  hardware game, except for where it works for Gemini and where it works for

765
00:45:35,905 --> 00:45:39,845
Speaker 8:  Gemini. And this is what's the big news This week is that the

766
00:45:39,845 --> 00:45:43,365
Speaker 8:  cameras, the new cameras that they've announced, which is a new outdoor camera,

767
00:45:43,605 --> 00:45:47,365
Speaker 8:  a new indoor camera and a new video doorbell, all wired,

768
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:51,445
Speaker 8:  all now have 2K sensors. Because the

769
00:45:51,555 --> 00:45:55,525
Speaker 8:  more data and the more fidelity they can pull in, the better they can

770
00:45:55,525 --> 00:45:58,845
Speaker 8:  feed into Gemini for home. And they, Anish

771
00:45:59,235 --> 00:46:02,525
Speaker 8:  Cran, who is the head of Google Home was sort of saying, these are the, these

772
00:46:02,525 --> 00:46:06,445
Speaker 8:  are the eyes for Gemini, this is like the multimodal AI that we need.

773
00:46:06,665 --> 00:46:09,965
Speaker 8:  Google Home has facial recognition feature.

774
00:46:10,545 --> 00:46:14,365
Speaker 8:  So you know, now your home, if you have these cameras, can

775
00:46:14,685 --> 00:46:18,645
Speaker 8:  recognize like who's who's at home and maybe adjust different

776
00:46:19,045 --> 00:46:22,565
Speaker 8:  routines or re you know, make your home fit

777
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:26,205
Speaker 8:  how you want it based on who's in the home because it can use

778
00:46:27,025 --> 00:46:30,965
Speaker 8:  the information and the data from these cameras also tell you who's

779
00:46:30,965 --> 00:46:34,885
Speaker 8:  at the front door, who's in the backyard, like having this

780
00:46:34,935 --> 00:46:38,245
Speaker 8:  extra data to pull into the Gemini

781
00:46:38,835 --> 00:46:42,485
Speaker 8:  ecosystem to be able to then inform other things in your smart home. This

782
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:46,285
Speaker 8:  is also what Amazon's doing with Ring and Alexa plus it's all

783
00:46:46,605 --> 00:46:50,565
Speaker 8:  bringing the AI is bringing together all the sources and the data sources

784
00:46:50,785 --> 00:46:54,765
Speaker 8:  of your home sensors, cameras, temperature,

785
00:46:55,285 --> 00:46:58,725
Speaker 8:  anything that that could play into what you want your home to do for you

786
00:46:58,785 --> 00:47:02,445
Speaker 8:  so that your home can potentially become more proactive.

787
00:47:02,665 --> 00:47:06,525
Speaker 8:  So you won't necessarily have to program it. Google is

788
00:47:06,525 --> 00:47:10,085
Speaker 8:  not at that stage yet. They seem a little behind,

789
00:47:10,385 --> 00:47:14,205
Speaker 8:  but they're, what you can see the, the path that they're going on. What's

790
00:47:14,605 --> 00:47:18,525
Speaker 8:  interesting about the new cameras, and actually this is also coming to all

791
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:22,485
Speaker 8:  the current cameras and even the discontinued ones going all the

792
00:47:22,485 --> 00:47:26,405
Speaker 8:  way back to 2015. So that's nice. I mean, I know yeah, good on

793
00:47:26,405 --> 00:47:30,365
Speaker 8:  Google. We rag on Google for discontinuing products all the time, But that,

794
00:47:30,365 --> 00:47:33,805
Speaker 8:  that they are still supporting this in the cameras that people may still

795
00:47:33,835 --> 00:47:37,765
Speaker 8:  have is a good thing. Yeah. So now you do have to pay a subscription

796
00:47:37,765 --> 00:47:41,645
Speaker 8:  for this, but with Gemini for home, you can type into their new app.

797
00:47:41,665 --> 00:47:44,485
Speaker 8:  So they have a new home app. You can sort of say, when was the last time

798
00:47:44,485 --> 00:47:48,365
Speaker 8:  you saw my cat? And it can pull, pull up any videos of cats

799
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:52,245
Speaker 8:  or was there a skunk in my driveway? Or what time did my

800
00:47:52,645 --> 00:47:56,005
Speaker 8:  daughter get home? Or you know, you could type that into the new home app

801
00:47:56,005 --> 00:47:59,925
Speaker 8:  and it will pull up footage for you. You can also use the home app to

802
00:47:59,925 --> 00:48:03,485
Speaker 8:  create automations. So you can just type in and say, you know,

803
00:48:04,445 --> 00:48:07,605
Speaker 8:  I want you to make me feel more secure. And it might come up with a suggestion,

804
00:48:07,675 --> 00:48:11,085
Speaker 8:  well, we'll lock your doors every day at 6:00 PM we'll turn the lights on

805
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:14,525
Speaker 8:  when you know when and when it gets dark, it'll come up with automations

806
00:48:14,545 --> 00:48:18,405
Speaker 8:  for you. So all of this sort of intelligence is using the data

807
00:48:18,475 --> 00:48:22,405
Speaker 8:  from your home and sort of being able to manage things for

808
00:48:22,425 --> 00:48:26,325
Speaker 8:  you. And it as, like I said, it's still kind of early days. So what

809
00:48:26,345 --> 00:48:29,845
Speaker 8:  I'd really like to see is like an automation based on

810
00:48:30,465 --> 00:48:34,405
Speaker 8:  the triggers that that cameras can now do. So like, okay,

811
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:38,615
Speaker 8:  I saw your cat outside and it was after dark, so I'm gonna send

812
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:42,095
Speaker 8:  you an alert or I'm gonna flash a light or you know, you know, to be

813
00:48:42,205 --> 00:48:45,895
Speaker 8:  proactive rather than me having to set up. But that's where you can see

814
00:48:46,435 --> 00:48:50,215
Speaker 8:  all of this going. And actually that's what Amazon demoed where

815
00:48:50,315 --> 00:48:53,055
Speaker 8:  it, it demoed an example with using Alexa plus

816
00:48:54,305 --> 00:48:58,095
Speaker 8:  Alexa actually said, oh, I noticed no one has fed the dog

817
00:48:58,095 --> 00:49:01,975
Speaker 8:  today. Would you like me to set a reminder to feed the dog

818
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:05,615
Speaker 8:  every day at a certain time? And they were able to set up an

819
00:49:05,615 --> 00:49:09,495
Speaker 8:  automation. So whenever the dog, whenever Alexa notices

820
00:49:09,495 --> 00:49:13,015
Speaker 8:  the dog hasn't been fed, it would send an an alert to,

821
00:49:13,355 --> 00:49:17,335
Speaker 8:  to the person who was supposed to feed the dog, obviously, you

822
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:20,975
Speaker 8:  know, you could also get a smart pet feeder. But the idea here is

823
00:49:21,365 --> 00:49:25,175
Speaker 8:  your home being proactive and both companies, Amazon and Google sort of moving

824
00:49:25,175 --> 00:49:28,935
Speaker 8:  towards that and this new hardware and this new Gemini for home platform

825
00:49:28,935 --> 00:49:32,735
Speaker 8:  is sort of laying the foundations for all of this. I know that was a lot.

826
00:49:33,795 --> 00:49:37,695
Speaker 5:  No, And I think it's, it's telling that a, these companies have, are, are

827
00:49:37,695 --> 00:49:41,295
Speaker 5:  all sort of converging on this same idea of like, what we need is lots and

828
00:49:41,295 --> 00:49:44,735
Speaker 5:  lots and lots of input in order to do this kind of stuff. I also think, by

829
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:47,815
Speaker 5:  the way, it's very funny that a huge part of the marketing for all of these

830
00:49:48,055 --> 00:49:51,895
Speaker 5:  platforms is you have a pet and you are a terrible pet owner. And

831
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:55,215
Speaker 5:  Yes. And like Ring is like, we have a, we have a way to use Ring cameras

832
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:58,735
Speaker 5:  to search for your lost dog because I know you're a terrible person who can't

833
00:49:58,735 --> 00:50:01,175
Speaker 5:  stop losing your dog. It's just all very funny. It's

834
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:03,975
Speaker 8:  Because no one can complain about pets, like, you know? Right,

835
00:50:04,385 --> 00:50:07,335
Speaker 5:  Right. It's soft subject and everybody is subject. It's, it's like, it's

836
00:50:07,335 --> 00:50:10,695
Speaker 5:  like kids, right? Like I will spend an unlimited amount of money if you can

837
00:50:10,895 --> 00:50:13,295
Speaker 5:  convince me that it will be good for my kids. Do you know what I like? It's,

838
00:50:13,325 --> 00:50:14,255
Speaker 5:  this is how they get you.

839
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:18,375
Speaker 8:  The other thing I didn't mention, mention that about the new Google Home

840
00:50:18,655 --> 00:50:22,255
Speaker 8:  hardware. So the Google Home speaker has Gemini in it now. Not Google

841
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:25,015
Speaker 8:  Assistant, but it also has Gemini Live.

842
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:30,125
Speaker 8:  And this is, so this is, most of the

843
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:33,205
Speaker 8:  listeners I'm sure are familiar with Gemini live like on your smartphone.

844
00:50:33,225 --> 00:50:36,525
Speaker 8:  Or you can like converse back and forth and it's, you don't have to keep

845
00:50:36,525 --> 00:50:37,565
Speaker 8:  saying the wake word, right?

846
00:50:37,565 --> 00:50:41,245
Speaker 5:  It's Gemini's version of like voice mode that you see in Chat GT or Claude.

847
00:50:41,245 --> 00:50:45,085
Speaker 8:  Exactly. And so you can now do this with the, it'll be on the

848
00:50:45,205 --> 00:50:48,325
Speaker 8:  new Google Home speaker, which is not launching until next spring,

849
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:52,925
Speaker 8:  but it's also on the Nest hub Max and the Nest audio

850
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:57,125
Speaker 8:  and the Nest Hub second gen. So you'll be able to use this

851
00:50:58,005 --> 00:51:01,205
Speaker 8:  starting today if you're in, or This week, if you're in early access and

852
00:51:01,265 --> 00:51:05,125
Speaker 8:  you actually wake work, you do a different wake word. You say, Hey gee, let's

853
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:08,405
Speaker 8:  chat. And you get this little ding ding and you get this new

854
00:51:09,225 --> 00:51:13,165
Speaker 8:  Gemini assistant Gemini live. And you can do that back and forth conversation.

855
00:51:13,185 --> 00:51:17,005
Speaker 8:  But annoyingly Gemini live has no way of taking any

856
00:51:17,005 --> 00:51:20,645
Speaker 8:  actions. So like, it can't do anything in your smart home. It can't like

857
00:51:20,795 --> 00:51:24,565
Speaker 8:  send you recipes to your phone or to the Nest hub. Right now it's

858
00:51:24,635 --> 00:51:28,365
Speaker 8:  just a, a more chatty chat bot. And that's actually

859
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:31,765
Speaker 8:  something I should mention about all of these. They do talk way too much.

860
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:35,565
Speaker 5:  They always kind of have, and no one, no one has quite,

861
00:51:35,565 --> 00:51:36,565
Speaker 8:  That is a bit a problem figured this

862
00:51:36,565 --> 00:51:40,405
Speaker 5:  Out yet. And they're also proud of themselves that they can talk in sentences

863
00:51:40,425 --> 00:51:44,365
Speaker 5:  now and they're just like, yeah, give us 11 paragraphs of information. Yeah.

864
00:51:44,365 --> 00:51:44,845
Speaker 5:  It's like, don't

865
00:51:44,845 --> 00:51:48,485
Speaker 8:  Just shut up and then all this kind of like, I hope that helped. Don't forget

866
00:51:48,485 --> 00:51:51,605
Speaker 8:  to have a nice day. Oh my gosh. Like, no, no, no, no, no.

867
00:51:52,635 --> 00:51:55,805
Speaker 5:  This is the stupidest thing. But ev whenever I'm in my car, in car play,

868
00:51:55,805 --> 00:51:59,765
Speaker 5:  Spotify has a thing. You tap the thing to search with audio while you're

869
00:51:59,765 --> 00:52:03,205
Speaker 5:  in the Spotify app on CarPlay and it pops up and the lights go around

870
00:52:03,205 --> 00:52:07,005
Speaker 5:  signaling that it's listening. But then you have to wait a full beat before

871
00:52:07,075 --> 00:52:10,125
Speaker 5:  Siri then goes, what would you like to play? And then you have to wait again

872
00:52:10,305 --> 00:52:13,165
Speaker 5:  and it dings again and then it's listening and it's like this, what are we,

873
00:52:13,235 --> 00:52:17,005
Speaker 5:  yeah, it's impossible Yeah. To do. It just drives me insane. We're gonna

874
00:52:17,005 --> 00:52:20,485
Speaker 5:  talk more about Google on Tuesday's show because I think

875
00:52:21,265 --> 00:52:25,045
Speaker 5:  the, the strategy there is really interesting And I continue to think

876
00:52:25,045 --> 00:52:28,965
Speaker 5:  Google is the company that has the most pieces already in the right

877
00:52:28,965 --> 00:52:32,165
Speaker 5:  place to do all of the things that it's trying to do. Definitely. I just

878
00:52:32,165 --> 00:52:35,525
Speaker 5:  have no faith in that company's ability to A, execute on them or B, stay

879
00:52:35,525 --> 00:52:39,285
Speaker 5:  interested in them long enough to do them. So we are going to

880
00:52:39,385 --> 00:52:42,685
Speaker 5:  get deep into that on next week's show. So we'll come back to that. Great.

881
00:52:43,065 --> 00:52:47,005
Speaker 5:  For now, we're gonna switch gears and talk about

882
00:52:47,105 --> 00:52:50,525
Speaker 5:  the strangest and most interesting television I have seen in a very long

883
00:52:50,525 --> 00:52:52,605
Speaker 5:  time. But first we're gonna take a

884
00:52:52,605 --> 00:52:53,925
Speaker 8:  Break of ads. Yeah,

885
00:52:53,925 --> 00:52:56,725
Speaker 5:  Seriously. We're Yeah, the the everything is ads.

886
00:52:57,635 --> 00:53:00,845
Speaker 5:  It's 2025. We're gonna take a break, we'll be right back. We're gonna talk

887
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:01,925
Speaker 5:  tally, be right back.

888
00:56:52,265 --> 00:56:55,955
Speaker 5:  have been using this device called Tele, which is basically a free

889
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:59,835
Speaker 5:  television that they ship to your house and put in your house and an

890
00:57:00,195 --> 00:57:03,755
Speaker 5:  exchange for it being a free television. There's a big bar of

891
00:57:04,055 --> 00:57:07,995
Speaker 5:  ads that runs below your television at all times. Is

892
00:57:07,995 --> 00:57:10,595
Speaker 5:  that a, is that a fair description of what you've been going through?

893
00:57:10,855 --> 00:57:12,315
Speaker 11:  Yes, that's, that's very accurate.

894
00:57:12,745 --> 00:57:16,315
Speaker 5:  Okay. So this has been a fascination both of mine and of the whole

895
00:57:16,755 --> 00:57:20,395
Speaker 5:  VERGE and Vergecast audience for a long time. And actually, let me just play

896
00:57:20,475 --> 00:57:23,955
Speaker 5:  a voicemail. We got on The Vergecast hotline from a listener a couple of

897
00:57:23,955 --> 00:57:26,075
Speaker 5:  weeks ago and then we're gonna get into it.

898
00:57:27,015 --> 00:57:30,995
Speaker 12:  Hey Vergecast, this is Eric Ju calling from Los Angeles. I

899
00:57:30,995 --> 00:57:34,075
Speaker 12:  just listened to your last pod and it really got me wondering what's going

900
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:37,955
Speaker 12:  on with telly. That company that gave

901
00:57:38,195 --> 00:57:41,955
Speaker 12:  everyone free TVs for unlimited advertisements on their TV

902
00:57:42,175 --> 00:57:46,155
Speaker 12:  or the second screen of their tv, I haven't heard from them in a while.

903
00:57:46,275 --> 00:57:49,595
Speaker 12:  I was wondering if we could check in with people and see what's going on

904
00:57:49,595 --> 00:57:53,435
Speaker 12:  with them. Is it going good? Isn't it a good model? I'm

905
00:57:53,435 --> 00:57:54,515
Speaker 12:  really curious. Thanks.

906
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:58,795
Speaker 5:  We had the, the CEO of Telly on the show a while ago, and ever

907
00:57:58,795 --> 00:58:02,115
Speaker 5:  since I actually, The Verge has been covering telly for a long time and you

908
00:58:02,455 --> 00:58:06,415
Speaker 5:  got a telly but you, you didn't get one as like a reviewer,

909
00:58:06,415 --> 00:58:07,375
Speaker 5:  you got a telly,

910
00:58:07,825 --> 00:58:11,055
Speaker 11:  Right? Yeah, I just kind of put my name in the hat. I mean, I didn't like

911
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:14,815
Speaker 11:  contact them or anything and tell them, oh, I'm gonna review this. They

912
00:58:14,935 --> 00:58:18,535
Speaker 11:  just kind of picked me out I guess and sent one to me

913
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,575
Speaker 11:  and yeah.

914
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:24,095
Speaker 5:  So tell me, I, I'm like, I just wanna start this experience at the very beginning.

915
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:27,015
Speaker 5:  'cause I think literally everything about Tell is weird and fascinating.

916
00:58:28,765 --> 00:58:31,655
Speaker 5:  Tell like what happens when telly arrives at your house?

917
00:58:32,165 --> 00:58:35,655
Speaker 11:  Yeah, well I think it actually begins before it even gets to your house

918
00:58:35,655 --> 00:58:39,455
Speaker 11:  because when you reserve a tele you have to

919
00:58:39,905 --> 00:58:43,615
Speaker 11:  agree to so many different things.

920
00:58:44,245 --> 00:58:48,135
Speaker 11:  Like it is, I mean, I do kind of give them credit for being very

921
00:58:48,135 --> 00:58:51,815
Speaker 11:  upfront about what they are doing here and that's to

922
00:58:51,815 --> 00:58:54,855
Speaker 11:  collect your data to use for its ads. And

923
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:59,335
Speaker 11:  like a lot of the questions you'll have to answer is like, how many people

924
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:03,175
Speaker 11:  are living in your house? Like, are you a parent? Like, do you

925
00:59:03,175 --> 00:59:05,335
Speaker 11:  like to go to the movie theater? Like stuff like that. Oh, interesting.

926
00:59:05,715 --> 00:59:09,255
Speaker 11:  And I filled all of this like giant questionnaire out

927
00:59:09,595 --> 00:59:09,815
Speaker 11:  and

928
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:15,495
Speaker 11:  I, as I know in my report, the first time the tell arrived it

929
00:59:15,515 --> 00:59:16,455
Speaker 11:  was broken

930
00:59:18,315 --> 00:59:18,535
Speaker 11:  and

931
00:59:19,885 --> 00:59:21,445
Speaker 5:  Like broken, like broken how

932
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:25,405
Speaker 11:  The whole screen was cracked. And of course Oh great. I didn't realize that

933
00:59:25,455 --> 00:59:29,085
Speaker 11:  until I got out of the box and set it up and turned it on and

934
00:59:29,345 --> 00:59:33,285
Speaker 11:  it was just broken. So I

935
00:59:33,285 --> 00:59:35,685
Speaker 11:  have to at least it was free. Exactly.

936
00:59:37,425 --> 00:59:41,005
Speaker 11:  It would've been more disappointing I think if it was like a Samsung or

937
00:59:41,005 --> 00:59:41,725
Speaker 11:  something. But,

938
00:59:42,825 --> 00:59:45,805
Speaker 5:  So I think, I mean part of what I think is so interesting is like this,

939
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:50,485
Speaker 5:  that's such a perfect company who has never shipped a

940
00:59:50,485 --> 00:59:53,205
Speaker 5:  television trying to figure out how to ship a television thing because I

941
00:59:53,205 --> 00:59:57,085
Speaker 5:  think like we, I I just looked this up And I, I interviewed Ilia pose

942
00:59:57,085 --> 01:00:01,045
Speaker 5:  in the CEO of Telly almost exactly two years ago on the show. Oh

943
01:00:01,045 --> 01:00:03,885
Speaker 5:  wow. And this was after they had started taking reservations and the thing

944
01:00:03,885 --> 01:00:07,845
Speaker 5:  existed and Telly's whole thing was like, we're

945
01:00:07,845 --> 01:00:11,125
Speaker 5:  just gonna say the quiet part loud, right? Like the, the, the Vizios of the

946
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:14,925
Speaker 5:  world out there are selling UTVs essentially at

947
01:00:15,035 --> 01:00:18,565
Speaker 5:  cost and they're making all of their money with advertising. And Roku

948
01:00:19,385 --> 01:00:23,005
Speaker 5:  is selling stuff really cheap and making all of its money on advertising

949
01:00:23,005 --> 01:00:26,765
Speaker 5:  and like, this is the business of television now is sneaky advertising.

950
01:00:27,065 --> 01:00:30,925
Speaker 5:  And he's just like, well what if I just took that all the way to

951
01:00:30,925 --> 01:00:34,485
Speaker 5:  its logical conclusion And I will ship you a television for free and it's

952
01:00:34,485 --> 01:00:37,965
Speaker 5:  gonna be a big beautiful television that is gonna have another screen

953
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:40,845
Speaker 5:  underneath it that just always shows you ads. And the ads are gonna be how

954
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,725
Speaker 5:  we make money by putting a billboard inside of your house. That's how we're

955
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:47,485
Speaker 5:  gonna make money. And then you can just sort of see them in the intervening

956
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:50,765
Speaker 5:  two and a half years be like, oh my God, we have to build and ship a television.

957
01:00:51,665 --> 01:00:51,885
Speaker 11:  And,

958
01:00:52,305 --> 01:00:55,925
Speaker 5:  And I just think that to me is like the, the perfect microcosm of this whole

959
01:00:55,925 --> 01:00:59,485
Speaker 5:  thing. And we've heard from so many people who are furious about the, the

960
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:03,285
Speaker 5:  amount of time it has taken for their own tellie to show up. And

961
01:01:03,915 --> 01:01:06,405
Speaker 5:  it's just like the, the things that they're doing where they're like, well,

962
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:08,765
Speaker 5:  it's really easy to make a tv, we'll just ship it to you for free and everything

963
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:12,725
Speaker 5:  will be fine. Like, nope, it's not nearly as simple as you make it

964
01:01:12,725 --> 01:01:15,925
Speaker 5:  sound. But you did eventually get a working television

965
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:17,285
Speaker 5:  to your house.

966
01:01:17,515 --> 01:01:21,285
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I have to say they were like pretty responsive with that. Like they,

967
01:01:21,395 --> 01:01:25,245
Speaker 11:  they sent a new TV like pretty quickly After that and it came

968
01:01:25,245 --> 01:01:29,085
Speaker 11:  through FedEx and once a, like we finally got it

969
01:01:29,105 --> 01:01:29,485
Speaker 11:  set up.

970
01:01:31,845 --> 01:01:34,975
Speaker 11:  It's, it's just funny 'cause it, like, it shows you like a whole introduction

971
01:01:34,975 --> 01:01:38,735
Speaker 11:  like how telly's the future of TV and like all this

972
01:01:38,735 --> 01:01:42,695
Speaker 11:  stuff. And then you just see the secondary display light up

973
01:01:42,715 --> 01:01:46,415
Speaker 11:  and it's just, it's pretty wild to see. Is it very

974
01:01:46,695 --> 01:01:50,575
Speaker 11:  distracting? It is. Like, can you watch a show and like, does

975
01:01:50,575 --> 01:01:54,255
Speaker 11:  it go away when you watch a show? No. Oh. I mean it's on

976
01:01:54,355 --> 01:01:58,295
Speaker 11:  all the time. You cannot turn it off and you can't cover it up because

977
01:01:58,845 --> 01:02:02,655
Speaker 11:  tele has it in their terms of service. You cannot cover the second screen.

978
01:02:03,675 --> 01:02:06,815
Speaker 5:  So wait, okay. Like, just describe what this thing looks like in your living

979
01:02:06,815 --> 01:02:09,655
Speaker 5:  room. Like, you, you, you get the whole thing set up and I'm just imagining

980
01:02:09,655 --> 01:02:13,645
Speaker 5:  like a, a TV on top and like a,

981
01:02:13,765 --> 01:02:16,605
Speaker 5:  I don't know, an iPad on the bottom. Like what, what, what does this actually

982
01:02:16,605 --> 01:02:18,365
Speaker 5:  look like when you put the thing in in place?

983
01:02:18,715 --> 01:02:22,565
Speaker 11:  Yeah, so the TV itself, it's a 55 inch screen and

984
01:02:23,075 --> 01:02:26,925
Speaker 11:  beneath it, it's a 10 inch display that runs the entire

985
01:02:26,925 --> 01:02:30,845
Speaker 11:  length of the screen. Okay. So it's just like an elongated, kinda like a

986
01:02:30,865 --> 01:02:31,085
Speaker 11:  bar,

987
01:02:31,385 --> 01:02:33,605
Speaker 5:  But it's 10 inches tall. That's a pretty tall Yeah.

988
01:02:33,745 --> 01:02:35,325
Speaker 11:  Screen. You

989
01:02:35,325 --> 01:02:36,485
Speaker 8:  Have to wall mount it then?

990
01:02:37,185 --> 01:02:41,045
Speaker 11:  No, I just, I put it on a stand. I'm not sure. You probably could

991
01:02:41,045 --> 01:02:45,005
Speaker 11:  well mount it, but this thing is heavy. Like it is very heavy. It is

992
01:02:45,005 --> 01:02:48,325
Speaker 11:  very tall and it's very like awkward to

993
01:02:48,985 --> 01:02:52,165
Speaker 11:  put on your stand. And does it

994
01:02:52,165 --> 01:02:56,005
Speaker 8:  Kind of do the bottom bit? Like is it connect fully connected or is it

995
01:02:56,045 --> 01:02:57,125
Speaker 8:  kinda like on a hinge?

996
01:02:57,795 --> 01:02:59,205
Speaker 11:  It's fully connected and there's a,

997
01:02:59,205 --> 01:03:02,125
Speaker 8:  It's just like part of the entire screen. So what's the total size

998
01:03:02,865 --> 01:03:05,885
Speaker 11:  That's, I actually am not sure about how tall it is,

999
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:10,405
Speaker 11:  but I know there's a soundbar like connecting the top

1000
01:03:10,405 --> 01:03:13,885
Speaker 11:  screen to the bottom and there's like a little webcam in there too.

1001
01:03:14,745 --> 01:03:14,965
Speaker 11:  So

1002
01:03:14,965 --> 01:03:15,885
Speaker 8:  It's like watching you,

1003
01:03:17,515 --> 01:03:21,375
Speaker 11:  The it has a privacy shutter. Okay. And it only opens,

1004
01:03:21,775 --> 01:03:21,895
Speaker 11:  I

1005
01:03:21,895 --> 01:03:23,575
Speaker 8:  Mean this is like Amazon's dream, right? Let's

1006
01:03:23,575 --> 01:03:26,335
Speaker 5:  All be honest with each other. It's watching you. And, and again, this is

1007
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:29,695
Speaker 5:  like the, the thing I love about this so much is it is, it is so

1008
01:03:29,845 --> 01:03:32,975
Speaker 5:  upfront straightforward about what it is doing. It's like, yeah, we're watching

1009
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:33,095
Speaker 5:  you.

1010
01:03:33,195 --> 01:03:34,455
Speaker 8:  People will do it like yeah, for free.

1011
01:03:34,455 --> 01:03:38,295
Speaker 5:  We'll throw you in jail if you cover up the advertising

1012
01:03:38,295 --> 01:03:41,615
Speaker 5:  screen. But yeah, I'm just looking at this picture that you took of it, Emma.

1013
01:03:41,675 --> 01:03:45,335
Speaker 5:  And the only way I can think to describe it is like, it it, imagine

1014
01:03:45,475 --> 01:03:49,335
Speaker 5:  if you took like a, like a just a row of laptop

1015
01:03:49,365 --> 01:03:53,295
Speaker 5:  screens and, and sort of put them on your table and then mount it your TV

1016
01:03:54,065 --> 01:03:58,015
Speaker 5:  above it is like the size wise, the only way that this is starting to

1017
01:03:58,015 --> 01:04:01,935
Speaker 5:  make sense to me 'cause it's this, it's a big bottom thing and then it has

1018
01:04:01,935 --> 01:04:04,255
Speaker 5:  a soundbar in the middle and then the 55 inch screen and then the little

1019
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:08,175
Speaker 5:  camera, it just looks like it's gonna tip over at all times. Like this,

1020
01:04:08,175 --> 01:04:10,975
Speaker 5:  this whole thing is like top heavy in a way that I'm finding really kind

1021
01:04:10,975 --> 01:04:12,015
Speaker 5:  of unnerving to look at.

1022
01:04:12,605 --> 01:04:16,495
Speaker 11:  Yeah. It's, I think it's a little bit more stable than it looks, but it

1023
01:04:16,495 --> 01:04:18,695
Speaker 11:  is just very unwieldy.

1024
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:21,935
Speaker 8:  Okay. The design was not thought through. It sounds like

1025
01:04:22,885 --> 01:04:25,655
Speaker 8:  it's not interior design ready. It's not a frame. Yeah,

1026
01:04:25,835 --> 01:04:29,535
Speaker 11:  No, I mean it's just, it's very tall. Like that's what I have to say. I've

1027
01:04:29,535 --> 01:04:31,375
Speaker 11:  never seen a tall TV like this before.

1028
01:04:32,075 --> 01:04:35,855
Speaker 5:  So the viewing experience, I would think best case scenario is

1029
01:04:35,995 --> 01:04:39,895
Speaker 5:  it would kind of feel like watching every show through

1030
01:04:40,075 --> 01:04:43,855
Speaker 5:  the like cable news Chiron where like you're, you're watching what you're

1031
01:04:43,935 --> 01:04:46,575
Speaker 5:  watching, but there's like something sort of happening on the bottom. Yeah.

1032
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:50,095
Speaker 5:  And we're all like a little bit used to that. It's a little annoying, but

1033
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,375
Speaker 5:  you're, we're a little bit used to it

1034
01:04:53,205 --> 01:04:56,215
Speaker 5:  over time. You used the thing for months. Did you eventually train yourself

1035
01:04:56,215 --> 01:04:59,335
Speaker 5:  to stop looking at the bottom screen? Can you, can you successfully ignore

1036
01:04:59,335 --> 01:05:01,775
Speaker 5:  it? Like that would be the goal, right? It's like you kind of stop noticing

1037
01:05:01,775 --> 01:05:04,735
Speaker 5:  it's there and you just watch the TV and everybody wins. Did you ever get

1038
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:05,175
Speaker 5:  to that point?

1039
01:05:05,955 --> 01:05:09,455
Speaker 11:  Not really. Oh no, it's just, it's like very distracting because

1040
01:05:09,485 --> 01:05:13,455
Speaker 11:  there's moving elements in the bottom screen, so your eyes are

1041
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:16,855
Speaker 11:  just always drawn to, like, there's a news ticker,

1042
01:05:17,035 --> 01:05:20,925
Speaker 11:  there's some of the ads that it shows are video ads and

1043
01:05:21,115 --> 01:05:25,085
Speaker 11:  they don't have sound, but they have subtitles that you can barely

1044
01:05:25,515 --> 01:05:29,045
Speaker 11:  read. But, And I, they have like

1045
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:33,085
Speaker 11:  rotating news stories, like you can customize like what the

1046
01:05:33,085 --> 01:05:37,045
Speaker 11:  widgets, the bottom bar shows, but you can't, you can't like fully

1047
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:41,325
Speaker 11:  get rid of that screen or like, I tried lowering the

1048
01:05:41,325 --> 01:05:45,205
Speaker 11:  brightness even and it just, it didn't even do anything. I feel like.

1049
01:05:45,995 --> 01:05:49,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So it looks like basically the, the left two thirds

1050
01:05:50,305 --> 01:05:53,605
Speaker 5:  is like widgets And I think you had it set up that it's like baseball scores

1051
01:05:54,025 --> 01:05:57,445
Speaker 5:  and weather and other news information.

1052
01:05:57,585 --> 01:05:59,405
Speaker 8:  So you can customize it a little bit there.

1053
01:05:59,715 --> 01:06:03,485
Speaker 11:  Yeah, you can, you can like kind of choose what you want in there or

1054
01:06:03,485 --> 01:06:05,845
Speaker 11:  like, and stuff like that. But,

1055
01:06:05,985 --> 01:06:09,205
Speaker 5:  And that I think was telly's big like operating system plan, if I'm remembering

1056
01:06:09,205 --> 01:06:11,485
Speaker 5:  this correctly. They had ideas about like, we're gonna have a whole app story.

1057
01:06:11,485 --> 01:06:13,605
Speaker 5:  You're gonna be able to do all kinds of stuff down there. It's gonna be super

1058
01:06:13,605 --> 01:06:17,405
Speaker 5:  cool and exciting and like you can, you can sort of, if you squint at it,

1059
01:06:17,465 --> 01:06:18,605
Speaker 5:  see why that might be something.

1060
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:23,365
Speaker 8:  Yeah. But how much would you pay for a TV like this? Like how much are you

1061
01:06:23,365 --> 01:06:26,965
Speaker 8:  really saving to give up your experience watching tv?

1062
01:06:27,325 --> 01:06:28,125
Speaker 8:  I mean, yeah,

1063
01:06:28,225 --> 01:06:31,845
Speaker 11:  That's like the main question because it's,

1064
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:36,085
Speaker 11:  I mean the TV itself, it's a, the display is nice And I mean it's

1065
01:06:36,085 --> 01:06:40,045
Speaker 11:  decent and the soundbar's nice. It's just,

1066
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:44,645
Speaker 11:  is it worth your privacy and your sanity basically?

1067
01:06:44,835 --> 01:06:45,125
Speaker 11:  Yeah.

1068
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:49,165
Speaker 8:  I mean, in TVs you could buy a TV for a nice TV for

1069
01:06:49,185 --> 01:06:50,285
Speaker 8:  not very much money these days.

1070
01:06:50,525 --> 01:06:54,325
Speaker 5:  I just, I just did one single Google search, so take this for

1071
01:06:54,525 --> 01:06:58,285
Speaker 5:  whatever it's worth. But I, I can, I can very quickly find a a

1072
01:06:58,295 --> 01:07:01,805
Speaker 5:  55 inch reason, like very well reviewed

1073
01:07:02,005 --> 01:07:04,285
Speaker 5:  TCL TV for 280 bucks. Yeah. I

1074
01:07:04,285 --> 01:07:07,405
Speaker 8:  Just, we just bought for our porch a 65 inch

1075
01:07:07,685 --> 01:07:10,965
Speaker 8:  TCL Google tv, I think it was

1076
01:07:10,965 --> 01:07:14,685
Speaker 8:  350 and we got it from wow. Costco. So it's like that,

1077
01:07:14,925 --> 01:07:18,725
Speaker 8:  I mean, how much better is something like this? How big is this?

1078
01:07:19,965 --> 01:07:22,105
Speaker 11:  How big is the It's a 55 inch. Okay.

1079
01:07:22,325 --> 01:07:22,625
Speaker 8:  So yeah.

1080
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:22,945
Speaker 11:  Display.

1081
01:07:23,885 --> 01:07:25,065
Speaker 8:  So this, but, but,

1082
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:29,505
Speaker 5:  But if I were to tell you that you can either have a TV for

1083
01:07:29,505 --> 01:07:33,345
Speaker 5:  $300 or you can have a TV for $0 and they're gonna make

1084
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:35,585
Speaker 5:  the same amount of money on you either way. Yeah.

1085
01:07:36,315 --> 01:07:38,095
Speaker 8:  People love free. Yeah. Yeah.

1086
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:40,935
Speaker 5:  But wait, Emma, can I say the single most devious thing that I think Tely

1087
01:07:40,935 --> 01:07:44,095
Speaker 5:  is doing here? And the thing that I kept laughing at reading your story is

1088
01:07:44,095 --> 01:07:47,575
Speaker 5:  that not only is it against the terms of service to cover up the advertising

1089
01:07:47,575 --> 01:07:51,455
Speaker 5:  stuff, they've actually moved so much of the interface down to the

1090
01:07:51,455 --> 01:07:55,015
Speaker 5:  bottom screen that you have to look at it all the time just to use

1091
01:07:55,475 --> 01:07:59,175
Speaker 5:  the television. Yeah. Which to me seems it's somewhere between

1092
01:07:59,285 --> 01:08:03,255
Speaker 5:  like really deeply gross and totally genius. Yeah. And I think

1093
01:08:03,325 --> 01:08:07,095
Speaker 5:  they're like, they know that you can't cover the TV and they have

1094
01:08:07,095 --> 01:08:09,575
Speaker 5:  made damn sure that you can't cover that bottom screen.

1095
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:13,335
Speaker 8:  All of that effort. I mean yeah, everything they effort they've put into

1096
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:17,245
Speaker 8:  making sure you see those ads. It is, it's like, it's like

1097
01:08:17,275 --> 01:08:18,885
Speaker 8:  evil genius levels here.

1098
01:08:19,465 --> 01:08:23,325
Speaker 11:  It truly is like you can't, you have to go to that screen to like

1099
01:08:23,325 --> 01:08:27,285
Speaker 11:  switch in between like your inputs and

1100
01:08:27,585 --> 01:08:31,405
Speaker 11:  to navigate between other apps as well and you really can't cover

1101
01:08:31,425 --> 01:08:33,685
Speaker 11:  it up. And I, they definitely did think about that.

1102
01:08:34,795 --> 01:08:38,765
Speaker 5:  It's really smart. So as other than watching TV like you, you know, you

1103
01:08:38,765 --> 01:08:41,845
Speaker 5:  mentioned you tried it as a, as a way to make Zoom calls. 'cause I think

1104
01:08:41,975 --> 01:08:45,805
Speaker 5:  again, like the thing I found fascinating about Telly's whole

1105
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:49,645
Speaker 5:  idea other than the, like we're just doing the quiet

1106
01:08:49,645 --> 01:08:52,765
Speaker 5:  part loud piece of it is like, Jan, I think you And I have talked about before

1107
01:08:52,785 --> 01:08:56,685
Speaker 5:  and agree on, is that there is huge potential for the TV as like the

1108
01:08:56,685 --> 01:08:59,685
Speaker 5:  central computer in your house. Yes. And there's lots of interesting smart

1109
01:08:59,685 --> 01:09:03,605
Speaker 5:  home stuff you can do. I think I spent a long time during the

1110
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:07,085
Speaker 5:  pandemic, like doing Zoom calls from a Facebook portal camera that I put

1111
01:09:07,085 --> 01:09:10,445
Speaker 5:  on top of my tv and it was awesome. Yeah. And so there's like, I think tele

1112
01:09:10,665 --> 01:09:14,645
Speaker 5:  has a bunch of those ideas. Did you get to test any of that

1113
01:09:14,645 --> 01:09:17,325
Speaker 5:  stuff? Is does any of that stuff even exist? Like what, what was good and

1114
01:09:17,325 --> 01:09:20,205
Speaker 5:  what was bad outside of just the TV watching experience?

1115
01:09:20,555 --> 01:09:23,365
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I tried doing Zoom and

1116
01:09:24,525 --> 01:09:27,525
Speaker 11:  I mean it, it worked for a little bit,

1117
01:09:28,385 --> 01:09:29,485
Speaker 11:  but for some reason,

1118
01:09:31,025 --> 01:09:34,925
Speaker 11:  oh, the microphone on the telly was not picking

1119
01:09:34,985 --> 01:09:38,965
Speaker 11:  up my voice. Like at first it was, it was worked for

1120
01:09:38,965 --> 01:09:42,045
Speaker 11:  like two seconds and then it just like cut off And I tried it again and

1121
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:45,685
Speaker 11:  it like, like another day and it just like totally didn't work. And

1122
01:09:45,985 --> 01:09:49,045
Speaker 11:  I'm not sure what happened there, but

1123
01:09:50,205 --> 01:09:51,965
Speaker 11:  I have to say like the navigating YouTube

1124
01:09:52,165 --> 01:09:55,245
Speaker 8:  Hardware is hard. Kelly, did you find this out?

1125
01:09:57,065 --> 01:10:00,165
Speaker 11:  But I mean, if you could get it working, it was kind of, it would be kind

1126
01:10:00,165 --> 01:10:03,805
Speaker 11:  of cool and you could have like little watch parties. Like, like you could

1127
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:07,765
Speaker 11:  have your friends like on the bottom display. Like you could see them

1128
01:10:07,775 --> 01:10:10,365
Speaker 11:  while you like watch a show together. I mean, they don't Oh, that's

1129
01:10:10,365 --> 01:10:10,525
Speaker 8:  Fun.

1130
01:10:10,795 --> 01:10:13,445
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Like they don't have to have a tele either. Like they could just go

1131
01:10:13,445 --> 01:10:16,885
Speaker 11:  on Zoom. Like if I could actually get like the mic working, like that would

1132
01:10:16,885 --> 01:10:17,405
Speaker 11:  be kind of cool.

1133
01:10:18,235 --> 01:10:21,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Th this is, this is the thing Tele keeps saying things that you're

1134
01:10:21,285 --> 01:10:23,845
Speaker 5:  like, oh, that seems like a good idea. And then they're like, but the device

1135
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:27,365
Speaker 5:  is free. And you're like, oh, I bet it's gonna be bad. Yeah. You also tried

1136
01:10:27,365 --> 01:10:29,165
Speaker 5:  an app that I believe is called Gofi.

1137
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:32,285
Speaker 11:  Oh yeah, yeah. The fitness app. Tell me about

1138
01:10:32,305 --> 01:10:32,525
Speaker 8:  Go.

1139
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:37,485
Speaker 11:  So basically it's almost like the Xbox Connect, like

1140
01:10:37,545 --> 01:10:41,325
Speaker 11:  it walks you through various like workouts and it uses like the

1141
01:10:41,325 --> 01:10:44,925
Speaker 11:  camera to I guess look at what you're doing and like

1142
01:10:45,295 --> 01:10:49,285
Speaker 11:  judge if you're doing it right. But I mean, I didn't, I thought

1143
01:10:49,285 --> 01:10:52,885
Speaker 11:  it was kind of cool 'cause I used to like used to connect so much

1144
01:10:53,075 --> 01:10:56,285
Speaker 11:  when I was like a long time ago when that was a thing and

1145
01:10:57,605 --> 01:11:00,965
Speaker 11:  I, yeah, it was just, it's just interesting. Like I thought that was kind

1146
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:02,605
Speaker 11:  of a cool idea that they had.

1147
01:11:02,915 --> 01:11:06,885
Speaker 8:  Yeah, there's a lot of this happening in TVs, like the Samsung TVs and also

1148
01:11:06,885 --> 01:11:10,805
Speaker 8:  the new fire TVs. They have millimeter wave sensors to kind of see

1149
01:11:10,835 --> 01:11:14,725
Speaker 8:  like your check your form and stuff, but, or you can stick a little

1150
01:11:14,725 --> 01:11:18,085
Speaker 8:  camera there as well. They don't have them built in for obvious reasons.

1151
01:11:18,425 --> 01:11:22,045
Speaker 8:  But yeah, I mean the tv, the giant screen in your living room is kinda like

1152
01:11:22,105 --> 01:11:25,845
Speaker 8:  the obvious place for so much of what we're seeing with like the smart home

1153
01:11:25,945 --> 01:11:29,445
Speaker 8:  and like home wellness, fitness, there's so much you can do there. I mean

1154
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:33,445
Speaker 8:  Apple TV fitness, obvious, I mean I use the fitness program with

1155
01:11:33,445 --> 01:11:36,965
Speaker 8:  my Apple TV all the time, you know, watch the guys

1156
01:11:37,025 --> 01:11:40,805
Speaker 8:  rowing in the studio and row along with them. All that kind of

1157
01:11:40,805 --> 01:11:44,245
Speaker 8:  interactive stuff is great. And it seems like if tele could start to

1158
01:11:44,665 --> 01:11:47,605
Speaker 8:  add a bit more value like that,

1159
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:52,215
Speaker 8:  those types of features, you could kind of see perhaps

1160
01:11:53,395 --> 01:11:56,775
Speaker 8:  the point of this. But I'm still, I'm still far behind, even though I don't

1161
01:11:56,775 --> 01:11:59,215
Speaker 8:  mind Amazon's ads on my Echo show device. It's

1162
01:11:59,685 --> 01:11:59,975
Speaker 5:  Emma

1163
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:00,935
Speaker 8:  Is too much. This is,

1164
01:12:00,935 --> 01:12:03,455
Speaker 5:  This is the big thing I've been thinking about this whole time is a question

1165
01:12:03,495 --> 01:12:07,335
Speaker 5:  I asked Ilia two years ago is you have all these big ideas about what a

1166
01:12:07,335 --> 01:12:10,095
Speaker 5:  TV could be. You have all these interesting features you wanna add, you have

1167
01:12:10,095 --> 01:12:12,615
Speaker 5:  all this stuff you could do. What if instead of selling me a free tv, you

1168
01:12:12,615 --> 01:12:13,815
Speaker 5:  sold me a really expensive TV

1169
01:12:13,925 --> 01:12:14,775
Speaker 8:  That did everything

1170
01:12:15,055 --> 01:12:18,895
Speaker 5:  Right and you, you made this stuff really good and it, it all worked and

1171
01:12:18,895 --> 01:12:22,575
Speaker 5:  you actually tried to sort of proactively make the case that this thing should

1172
01:12:22,575 --> 01:12:25,815
Speaker 5:  be the center of your home in this like meaningful technological way. And

1173
01:12:25,815 --> 01:12:28,135
Speaker 5:  his answer to me was essentially I could do that and it would be great and

1174
01:12:28,295 --> 01:12:31,775
Speaker 5:  absolutely nobody would buy it because oh, the, the price race of televisions

1175
01:12:31,775 --> 01:12:35,055
Speaker 5:  has gone all the way down to the bottom such that if I tried to sell you

1176
01:12:35,055 --> 01:12:38,775
Speaker 5:  the best TV you've ever seen in your entire life and it did everything perfectly,

1177
01:12:38,915 --> 01:12:42,535
Speaker 5:  no one would buy it anyway. But I'm curious, you've now used the thing and

1178
01:12:42,535 --> 01:12:46,375
Speaker 5:  lived with it for a while. Like, is is there a version of this

1179
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:48,655
Speaker 5:  idea that is compelling to you?

1180
01:12:49,295 --> 01:12:52,895
Speaker 11:  I think it would be kind of, it is an interesting concept

1181
01:12:53,395 --> 01:12:56,635
Speaker 11:  And I think like in the future,

1182
01:12:57,315 --> 01:13:01,235
Speaker 11:  I know like even streaming services are free now. I just, I

1183
01:13:01,235 --> 01:13:04,355
Speaker 11:  think, I think like they're relying on being free so much

1184
01:13:04,985 --> 01:13:08,835
Speaker 11:  that it's almost like taking away from the tv. Like you were,

1185
01:13:09,065 --> 01:13:12,795
Speaker 11:  like you were just saying, I mean I, I do wonder

1186
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:17,155
Speaker 11:  how it would be if they did sell it like for a price tag.

1187
01:13:17,515 --> 01:13:21,315
Speaker 11:  I mean it's just, I don't know. Like, I just don't

1188
01:13:21,315 --> 01:13:24,595
Speaker 11:  know if like, I don't know about the ads. Like I think if they got rid of

1189
01:13:24,595 --> 01:13:28,395
Speaker 11:  the ads and maybe made it like a really innovative tv,

1190
01:13:28,465 --> 01:13:32,435
Speaker 11:  like kept the secondary display, but maybe

1191
01:13:32,435 --> 01:13:36,235
Speaker 11:  like did have cool apps on there, like allowed you to do watch parties and

1192
01:13:36,235 --> 01:13:39,755
Speaker 11:  stuff like that. Maybe that would be viable.

1193
01:13:40,355 --> 01:13:40,555
Speaker 11:  I think

1194
01:13:40,555 --> 01:13:43,835
Speaker 8:  We just all have to come to terms with that this is probably the future and

1195
01:13:43,835 --> 01:13:46,795
Speaker 8:  that we are all gonna have mini billboards all over our homes. It's gonna

1196
01:13:46,795 --> 01:13:49,995
Speaker 8:  be our fridges, it's gonna be on our smartest place. Yep. It's gonna be hanging

1197
01:13:49,995 --> 01:13:53,875
Speaker 8:  under our TVs. It is like, the home has

1198
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:57,715
Speaker 8:  been the sacred space for advertising, right? It's not been in our

1199
01:13:57,715 --> 01:14:01,315
Speaker 8:  homes. It's everywhere else you go. It's in your email, it's on your phone,

1200
01:14:01,425 --> 01:14:05,315
Speaker 8:  it's wherever you walk around the world. There are ads, but they've not

1201
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:08,635
Speaker 8:  been in our homes. But it does seem inevitable.

1202
01:14:09,505 --> 01:14:13,405
Speaker 8:  It's like they're coming and obviously in this instance telly, you are

1203
01:14:13,605 --> 01:14:17,365
Speaker 8:  inviting them in, in Amazon's instances with the shows they added them

1204
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:20,725
Speaker 8:  after the fact. And same thing's happening with the Samsung fridge. I know

1205
01:14:20,725 --> 01:14:23,685
Speaker 8:  you guys talked about that on the show a while back. I haven't seen them

1206
01:14:23,685 --> 01:14:27,645
Speaker 8:  on mine yet. I'm keeping an eye out. But yeah, that it's like, that

1207
01:14:27,995 --> 01:14:31,925
Speaker 8:  encroaching on the sacred space is just happening more and more and

1208
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:35,485
Speaker 8:  more and it needs to stop and we yeah. We need one safe space.

1209
01:14:36,195 --> 01:14:36,685
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Yeah.

1210
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:39,685
Speaker 5:  And I think like there's already so much advertising on your tv, right? Like

1211
01:14:39,905 --> 01:14:43,725
Speaker 5:  I'm on record is saying I have absolutely no problem with the pause ads

1212
01:14:43,725 --> 01:14:46,445
Speaker 5:  that everybody has on streaming services now. I actually think that is like

1213
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:49,725
Speaker 5:  a terrifically good idea And I hope they all make so much money on it that

1214
01:14:49,725 --> 01:14:53,125
Speaker 5:  they never have to do anything else. Like if I'm pausing my show, I'm not

1215
01:14:53,325 --> 01:14:55,405
Speaker 5:  watching, I don't care what's on the screen. Right. It's, it's the same way

1216
01:14:55,445 --> 01:14:57,845
Speaker 5:  I feel about the, the Kindle ads. Like we were just talking about, like,

1217
01:14:58,265 --> 01:15:02,165
Speaker 5:  I'm not doing anything here. Sure. Show me an ad. But I think like

1218
01:15:02,275 --> 01:15:05,045
Speaker 5:  Emma, it seems like the, the real bummer of your experience so much was that

1219
01:15:05,045 --> 01:15:08,685
Speaker 5:  not only are the ads there, they are perpetually fighting the thing that

1220
01:15:08,685 --> 01:15:11,565
Speaker 5:  you're actually trying to do on your tv. That so it's not Yeah, it's not,

1221
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:15,205
Speaker 5:  it's not even interruptive. It's, it's actively making the

1222
01:15:15,205 --> 01:15:16,045
Speaker 5:  experience worse.

1223
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:17,205
Speaker 11:  Mm. Yeah, exactly.

1224
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:18,165
Speaker 5:  And that's hard to get over.

1225
01:15:18,835 --> 01:15:20,325
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I think so. Are you

1226
01:15:20,325 --> 01:15:20,885
Speaker 8:  Sending it back?

1227
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:24,845
Speaker 11:  I am going to soon. I think,

1228
01:15:25,515 --> 01:15:28,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah, because this is not, this is actually a really an unusually good question

1229
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:32,085
Speaker 5:  to ask in this context because like mostly we're like product

1230
01:15:32,085 --> 01:15:34,805
Speaker 5:  reviewers who use these things and then send them back to companies anyway.

1231
01:15:35,045 --> 01:15:37,365
Speaker 5:  'cause yes, for ethical reasons, we don't, we don't keep any of the stuff

1232
01:15:37,365 --> 01:15:41,245
Speaker 5:  that we review a I don't know if that applies here 'cause the TV's

1233
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:45,085
Speaker 5:  free in the first place, but B you just got one. So if you just wanted this

1234
01:15:45,085 --> 01:15:48,925
Speaker 5:  to be your tv, it could be your tv. Yeah. Is this gonna be your

1235
01:15:48,925 --> 01:15:49,125
Speaker 5:  tv?

1236
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:50,165
Speaker 11:  No,

1237
01:15:53,075 --> 01:15:56,845
Speaker 11:  like I, I have a, my lg I'm very,

1238
01:15:57,065 --> 01:15:57,965
Speaker 11:  I'm very happy with

1239
01:15:59,915 --> 01:16:02,765
Speaker 5:  What was the, what was the breaking point for you that you were like, I just,

1240
01:16:02,765 --> 01:16:04,445
Speaker 5:  this is not an experience I can do anymore?

1241
01:16:04,865 --> 01:16:08,765
Speaker 11:  It was almost like, not even the ads, it was just the interface

1242
01:16:09,345 --> 01:16:13,315
Speaker 11:  itself because it kind of takes a long time to boot up.

1243
01:16:14,135 --> 01:16:14,595
Speaker 11:  God, it

1244
01:16:14,595 --> 01:16:15,275
Speaker 8:  Just gets worse.

1245
01:16:15,505 --> 01:16:18,435
Speaker 11:  Your subject to like an AI news

1246
01:16:19,065 --> 01:16:21,955
Speaker 11:  segment when you turn on the TV and Wait

1247
01:16:21,955 --> 01:16:22,595
Speaker 5:  What? Hold on,

1248
01:16:23,065 --> 01:16:23,515
Speaker 11:  Hold on.

1249
01:16:24,495 --> 01:16:24,715
Speaker 8:  How

1250
01:16:25,055 --> 01:16:25,275
Speaker 5:  So

1251
01:16:25,275 --> 01:16:28,715
Speaker 8:  There's an ad before you get to actually see the tv? Yes. Oh

1252
01:16:28,715 --> 01:16:31,635
Speaker 5:  My. Okay. This is not a thing I even thought I needed to ask. Okay. I need,

1253
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:35,435
Speaker 5:  I have a new question for you, Emma. You walk into the room, you sit down,

1254
01:16:35,895 --> 01:16:38,625
Speaker 5:  you pick up the remote, what happens?

1255
01:16:39,615 --> 01:16:43,305
Speaker 11:  Okay, so it, like, it'll display

1256
01:16:43,355 --> 01:16:47,145
Speaker 11:  telly on the TV while it like boots up. Okay. And then once that

1257
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:50,865
Speaker 11:  happens, the telly today segment comes on and

1258
01:16:51,535 --> 01:16:54,905
Speaker 11:  that uses an AI likeness of an actress

1259
01:16:55,685 --> 01:16:59,625
Speaker 11:  who then details all these news stories. Like, I

1260
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:02,865
Speaker 11:  did not know she was ai at first. I was like, 'cause then when I started

1261
01:17:02,865 --> 01:17:06,145
Speaker 11:  using the TV I was like, why is she wearing the same outfit every day

1262
01:17:06,965 --> 01:17:09,525
Speaker 11:  and with the same hair? I was like, this is not women

1263
01:17:09,615 --> 01:17:11,285
Speaker 8:  Would really pick up on that. She's

1264
01:17:11,285 --> 01:17:12,765
Speaker 5:  So busy. How is she doing this every

1265
01:17:12,785 --> 01:17:15,605
Speaker 11:  Day? I, I was just like, this isn't right. Like,

1266
01:17:16,355 --> 01:17:20,005
Speaker 5:  Okay, how, how long is this news broadcast?

1267
01:17:21,355 --> 01:17:24,965
Speaker 11:  It's not like I like listen to the whole thing on like

1268
01:17:25,145 --> 01:17:28,485
Speaker 11:  the whole thing through. 'cause then it just like loops. I'm not sure how

1269
01:17:29,155 --> 01:17:32,365
Speaker 11:  long it is, but it was not that long. Like it'll end.

1270
01:17:33,265 --> 01:17:36,045
Speaker 11:  And the worst part is though, is that when you turn off the TV and turn

1271
01:17:36,045 --> 01:17:39,645
Speaker 11:  it back on, it just like resets. So you can't like pick off,

1272
01:17:39,835 --> 01:17:42,885
Speaker 11:  pick up where you left off on the new segment. It just like starts at the

1273
01:17:42,885 --> 01:17:43,965
Speaker 11:  beginning again. Yeah,

1274
01:17:43,965 --> 01:17:47,845
Speaker 5:  No, I'm immediately out like yeah, literally just that I'm like

1275
01:17:47,845 --> 01:17:49,005
Speaker 5:  back in the box. You didn't

1276
01:17:49,225 --> 01:17:50,045
Speaker 8:  Out, you didn't give a score.

1277
01:17:50,475 --> 01:17:51,405
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Okay,

1278
01:17:51,675 --> 01:17:53,765
Speaker 8:  Come on. What's the score? What's

1279
01:17:53,765 --> 01:17:54,485
Speaker 11:  The review score?

1280
01:17:54,525 --> 01:17:54,725
Speaker 8:  I mean,

1281
01:17:55,305 --> 01:17:58,645
Speaker 11:  If I had to pick a number, I mean like maybe like a

1282
01:17:59,405 --> 01:18:02,405
Speaker 11:  a four. I'm not, I'm not a reviewer or something. I'm like,

1283
01:18:03,805 --> 01:18:06,805
Speaker 8:  I know. I don't know. Based on this, I I'm thinking a solid two.

1284
01:18:07,435 --> 01:18:08,045
Speaker 11:  Okay. Yeah.

1285
01:18:09,425 --> 01:18:09,645
Speaker 8:  So,

1286
01:18:10,745 --> 01:18:11,445
Speaker 5:  But it's free.

1287
01:18:11,795 --> 01:18:14,245
Speaker 11:  Yeah, exactly. I mean, but AI

1288
01:18:14,705 --> 01:18:15,365
Speaker 8:  And ads.

1289
01:18:15,965 --> 01:18:19,725
Speaker 11:  Yeah. And then in between the new segment you also get more ads. Oh my god.

1290
01:18:20,065 --> 01:18:21,765
Speaker 11:  On your main display. Okay.

1291
01:18:21,765 --> 01:18:25,085
Speaker 5:  So wait, I'm now so hung up on the startup experience here. I'm really sorry.

1292
01:18:25,505 --> 01:18:29,125
Speaker 5:  So so you turn it on the, the the news thing

1293
01:18:29,185 --> 01:18:33,165
Speaker 5:  starts playing the, the AI woman tells you what I

1294
01:18:33,165 --> 01:18:36,405
Speaker 5:  guess whatever news stories tell he thinks are interesting that day. Yeah.

1295
01:18:36,405 --> 01:18:37,405
Speaker 8:  Like what is it? Was it

1296
01:18:37,405 --> 01:18:41,285
Speaker 11:  What's it's it's mainly like celebrity like news or like

1297
01:18:41,285 --> 01:18:42,805
Speaker 11:  viral videos. Like

1298
01:18:43,105 --> 01:18:46,645
Speaker 5:  I'm just imagining like the a team at telly trying to like program the daily

1299
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:50,165
Speaker 5:  every day to like make for, but anyway, okay, so you go through that. Can

1300
01:18:50,165 --> 01:18:54,085
Speaker 5:  you, can you just immediately like home button out of that and

1301
01:18:54,085 --> 01:18:54,765
Speaker 5:  then go to your apps?

1302
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:59,725
Speaker 11:  Yeah, you can like, you can just click your, your

1303
01:18:59,775 --> 01:19:03,445
Speaker 11:  input 'cause Okay. It operates like you can't even, it doesn't even have

1304
01:19:03,445 --> 01:19:06,845
Speaker 11:  built in streaming apps. Like you, it comes with a a Google

1305
01:19:07,305 --> 01:19:07,725
Speaker 11:  dongle.

1306
01:19:08,025 --> 01:19:08,605
Speaker 5:  Oh, right.

1307
01:19:08,875 --> 01:19:09,885
Speaker 8:  Like a Chromecast.

1308
01:19:10,315 --> 01:19:11,765
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I think so. Google

1309
01:19:11,945 --> 01:19:12,565
Speaker 8:  TV thing.

1310
01:19:12,795 --> 01:19:15,845
Speaker 11:  Yeah. It's like the little Google TV dongle. And

1311
01:19:16,205 --> 01:19:18,645
Speaker 5:  I forgot that it was that they haven't even, yeah. And I think the plan was

1312
01:19:18,925 --> 01:19:22,445
Speaker 5:  not to be like that forever, but to like offload

1313
01:19:22,615 --> 01:19:26,165
Speaker 5:  Again, this is an advertising company, right? That's, it's important to keep

1314
01:19:26,405 --> 01:19:29,805
Speaker 5:  remembering that this is an advertising company. Okay. But so, but you're

1315
01:19:29,805 --> 01:19:32,725
Speaker 5:  gonna get like a jump scare essentially every time you turn on your tv because

1316
01:19:32,725 --> 01:19:35,485
Speaker 5:  there's just gonna be an AI woman yelling news at you every time you turn

1317
01:19:35,485 --> 01:19:37,485
Speaker 5:  on, which is kind of alarming when first turn on the tv.

1318
01:19:37,485 --> 01:19:40,445
Speaker 11:  It's a little, it's a little unsettling. 'cause she's always like, hello,

1319
01:19:40,455 --> 01:19:44,205
Speaker 11:  hello friends. Like we're gonna, and then like she goes

1320
01:19:44,315 --> 01:19:48,085
Speaker 11:  into the thing and it's, I don't know. And there's, there's another

1321
01:19:49,025 --> 01:19:52,805
Speaker 11:  AI person that shows up. I noticed too in there edge.

1322
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:56,445
Speaker 11:  It's just, I it's just a bizarre experience.

1323
01:19:56,555 --> 01:19:58,085
Speaker 8:  It's a dystopian nightmare. Yes.

1324
01:19:59,275 --> 01:19:59,565
Speaker 11:  Yeah.

1325
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:00,565
Speaker 5:  That is, that is tough.

1326
01:20:00,705 --> 01:20:04,125
Speaker 8:  But you brought into your home for free though, so there's the bonus. Yeah.

1327
01:20:04,185 --> 01:20:05,605
Speaker 8:  You didn't spend any money on this.

1328
01:20:06,165 --> 01:20:09,405
Speaker 5:  I do think this is a fascinating test And I know we, we should, we should

1329
01:20:09,405 --> 01:20:12,965
Speaker 5:  switch gears and, and get to the lightning round. But I I do know there are

1330
01:20:13,165 --> 01:20:16,765
Speaker 5:  a lot of VERGE readers and Vergecast listeners who signed up to get one of

1331
01:20:16,765 --> 01:20:20,165
Speaker 5:  these things and have them in your house. And I think this is maybe the most

1332
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:24,925
Speaker 5:  straightforward test we've ever had of what people are willing to put

1333
01:20:24,925 --> 01:20:27,925
Speaker 5:  up with for free stuff. Yeah. And I I mean that like,

1334
01:20:28,795 --> 01:20:32,045
Speaker 5:  like everybody's price tolerance is different. There is a whole spectrum

1335
01:20:32,105 --> 01:20:35,565
Speaker 5:  of stuff we are willing to put up with for free, right? Like my Gmail got

1336
01:20:35,715 --> 01:20:38,845
Speaker 5:  more and more ads all the time And I keep using Gmail. Like the, everybody

1337
01:20:38,845 --> 01:20:41,205
Speaker 5:  has been testing this theory for years and years and years and years. And

1338
01:20:41,205 --> 01:20:44,565
Speaker 5:  I think this is the most extreme version of it we've ever encountered. Like

1339
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:48,805
Speaker 5:  what if all of this was blaring in your face at all times, but you

1340
01:20:48,805 --> 01:20:52,565
Speaker 5:  got to save $300 on your tv. And I think I, I want to hear from everyone

1341
01:20:52,565 --> 01:20:55,685
Speaker 5:  who has one of these in your house. Call the hotline, it's six gigs, version

1342
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:59,365
Speaker 5:  one, one, send us an email Vergecast to The Verge dot com. I

1343
01:20:59,915 --> 01:21:03,125
Speaker 5:  genuinely no judgment on any direction, but I want to know if you kept your

1344
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:06,805
Speaker 5:  tell, And I want to know whether it has proven to be worth it for you or

1345
01:21:06,805 --> 01:21:10,365
Speaker 5:  not. Because I think there's a lot of this stuff that Emma sounds like just

1346
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:14,205
Speaker 5:  sort of first gen problems that it's like, I suspect the next webcam

1347
01:21:14,205 --> 01:21:16,565
Speaker 5:  would be better. I suspect some of the apps would get better if this thing

1348
01:21:16,565 --> 01:21:20,485
Speaker 5:  becomes popular. People will start to like there if there is

1349
01:21:20,565 --> 01:21:24,045
Speaker 5:  a, there, there with this. I actually think V two might be really

1350
01:21:24,365 --> 01:21:27,525
Speaker 5:  fascinating. I also think it's possible that enough people are gonna have

1351
01:21:27,525 --> 01:21:31,125
Speaker 5:  the experience you did of just like, this becomes untenable. Because the

1352
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:34,765
Speaker 5:  longer I sit here and watch it, the more I hate it that the whole

1353
01:21:34,785 --> 01:21:37,685
Speaker 5:  thesis behind this device is just not going to work

1354
01:21:38,115 --> 01:21:42,085
Speaker 8:  Well and this has to be in your main viewing

1355
01:21:42,085 --> 01:21:44,685
Speaker 8:  area, right? I think I read that in your piece. Yeah. You can't like put

1356
01:21:44,685 --> 01:21:47,845
Speaker 8:  this in the guest room or something as your extra tv. This has Yeah,

1357
01:21:48,225 --> 01:21:49,285
Speaker 11:  You're not supposed to.

1358
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:51,645
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I was gonna say, how do they know that?

1359
01:21:52,515 --> 01:21:56,205
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Well that's another thing. Like you're supposed to keep it connected.

1360
01:21:56,205 --> 01:21:58,725
Speaker 11:  The internet plugged at all times, but at one point.

1361
01:21:58,755 --> 01:22:01,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Has anyone from telly like shown up at your house to make sure I'm

1362
01:22:01,485 --> 01:22:04,165
Speaker 5:  imagining just like a, like a random inspection kind of situation.

1363
01:22:04,845 --> 01:22:08,165
Speaker 11:  I was actually kind of scared because like, I left it unplugged for like

1364
01:22:08,295 --> 01:22:12,045
Speaker 11:  three weeks. I was like on vacation and nothing happened. So

1365
01:22:12,245 --> 01:22:13,605
Speaker 11:  I was a little bit nervous about that

1366
01:22:13,605 --> 01:22:16,725
Speaker 5:  Though. You come home, you're like, I've been robbed, but only for one specifically.

1367
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:23,405
Speaker 5:  All right, I wanna hear from everybody. Emma, are you, will you stick around

1368
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:26,525
Speaker 5:  and do some lightning round with us? Yeah. All right. Good. All right. We

1369
01:22:26,545 --> 01:22:30,005
Speaker 5:  are gonna come back and do a lightning round. Emma's going to ship her tele

1370
01:22:30,005 --> 01:22:31,125
Speaker 5:  back and we'll be right back.

1371
01:25:04,185 --> 01:25:07,985
Speaker 11:  I mean, they're not like realistic human faces. They're like kind of cartoony

1372
01:25:08,725 --> 01:25:11,065
Speaker 11:  and it's just bizarre to see

1373
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:16,705
Speaker 11:  like, you, you click on 'em and they're like, hello Emma, how may

1374
01:25:16,705 --> 01:25:19,825
Speaker 11:  I help you today? And they're like, whole mouth moves and

1375
01:25:20,455 --> 01:25:23,985
Speaker 11:  it's just kind of creepy to be honest. And I think I'd rather have

1376
01:25:24,525 --> 01:25:28,345
Speaker 11:  the little copilot bean thing that they used to have or

1377
01:25:28,345 --> 01:25:32,265
Speaker 11:  that they were trying before. Like I'd rather have that talk

1378
01:25:32,265 --> 01:25:33,265
Speaker 11:  at me. I think

1379
01:25:34,075 --> 01:25:35,465
Speaker 5:  Jen's out on The Bean. No,

1380
01:25:35,885 --> 01:25:39,425
Speaker 8:  The idea of giving AI a face is definitely something we're seeing ev all

1381
01:25:39,425 --> 01:25:43,025
Speaker 8:  the tech companies try and sort of tackle with now. I mean the, the rumor

1382
01:25:43,045 --> 01:25:46,945
Speaker 8:  wasn't the rumor here that the new Apple smart display

1383
01:25:46,945 --> 01:25:50,865
Speaker 8:  is gonna have like a clippy, like, not like bean, but what's the, the

1384
01:25:50,885 --> 01:25:54,705
Speaker 8:  finder like face. So like, because I think one of the keys

1385
01:25:54,705 --> 01:25:58,465
Speaker 8:  here is some expression does help with the communication,

1386
01:25:58,925 --> 01:26:02,705
Speaker 8:  but does it need to be human or can it just be, you know, some

1387
01:26:02,705 --> 01:26:06,645
Speaker 8:  kind of of like smile, like on the Echoes devices you're talking

1388
01:26:06,645 --> 01:26:10,045
Speaker 8:  about there, it's like little smile now pops up to sort of show some

1389
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:13,565
Speaker 8:  interaction. So you kind of need some feedback, but does it need to be,

1390
01:26:13,865 --> 01:26:17,445
Speaker 8:  and yeah, you're right, these are not, these are kind of creepy looking

1391
01:26:17,855 --> 01:26:21,765
Speaker 8:  characters. Can you stylize them at all? Do

1392
01:26:22,005 --> 01:26:25,365
Speaker 8:  you know? Or does it you just choose one of them? Yeah. Like can you customize

1393
01:26:25,395 --> 01:26:28,165
Speaker 8:  your copilot creature? I

1394
01:26:28,165 --> 01:26:30,485
Speaker 11:  Think you can, you have to just choose one of them.

1395
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:31,165
Speaker 8:  Okay.

1396
01:26:32,805 --> 01:26:36,125
Speaker 11:  I can see them in the future, like making, letting you customize them. But

1397
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:39,805
Speaker 11:  for now it's just kind of like, here you go. Like just pick. And

1398
01:26:39,965 --> 01:26:43,085
Speaker 8:  Where does it come? Like I have not used a Windows computer in a very long

1399
01:26:43,085 --> 01:26:47,045
Speaker 8:  time. So does it like just middle of the screen or is it in the corner or

1400
01:26:47,045 --> 01:26:48,845
Speaker 8:  where, where do they appear? I

1401
01:26:48,845 --> 01:26:51,765
Speaker 11:  Just put it like on a, it's on like the browser.

1402
01:26:52,555 --> 01:26:55,765
Speaker 11:  Like I just tried it on the browser and it just is like in the middle of

1403
01:26:55,765 --> 01:26:59,525
Speaker 11:  your browser, like a big face that's just like talking to you

1404
01:26:59,585 --> 01:27:03,565
Speaker 11:  and you and you talk back aloud to it and it's just like, it's

1405
01:27:03,565 --> 01:27:06,725
Speaker 11:  just kind of bizarre. Like I can see that what they're trying to get at.

1406
01:27:06,985 --> 01:27:10,685
Speaker 11:  But like I, I'm not sure if AI really needs a human face.

1407
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:13,405
Speaker 5:  It is, it is one of those things that I I think you're totally right, Emma,

1408
01:27:13,405 --> 01:27:16,965
Speaker 5:  that you can like absolutely a hundred percent imagine the series of

1409
01:27:17,245 --> 01:27:20,845
Speaker 5:  decisions that led to the launch of, I think it's called portraits.

1410
01:27:21,985 --> 01:27:24,805
Speaker 5:  And every single one of those decisions was the wrong one.

1411
01:27:25,865 --> 01:27:29,725
Speaker 5:  And it's just like, it's you because it's like, I think that most people's

1412
01:27:29,725 --> 01:27:32,925
Speaker 5:  experiences, you, you load up something like the chat GBT voice mode and

1413
01:27:32,925 --> 01:27:36,885
Speaker 5:  it has this sort of pulsing thing that's that that gives you this idea that

1414
01:27:36,885 --> 01:27:40,765
Speaker 5:  it's listening and you want something that seems active, right? So

1415
01:27:40,765 --> 01:27:43,245
Speaker 5:  it doesn't just feel like you're shouting at a static screen, which feels

1416
01:27:43,305 --> 01:27:47,265
Speaker 5:  bad. And so figuring out what those animations

1417
01:27:47,265 --> 01:27:49,505
Speaker 5:  should be and how they should work and what kind of character it should be,

1418
01:27:49,545 --> 01:27:51,785
Speaker 5:  I actually think is a really interesting exploration. And I know all these

1419
01:27:51,985 --> 01:27:55,385
Speaker 5:  companies are doing that on terms of like what is the, the tone of voice

1420
01:27:55,385 --> 01:27:57,825
Speaker 5:  that these things should have and what is the character of them and how should

1421
01:27:57,825 --> 01:28:01,745
Speaker 5:  they talk and should they use words like suss, like all these different things

1422
01:28:01,905 --> 01:28:05,145
Speaker 5:  I think are, are super interesting and valuable. And I think if you land

1423
01:28:05,145 --> 01:28:09,105
Speaker 5:  on like polar express level animated people, you have gone

1424
01:28:09,115 --> 01:28:09,465
Speaker 5:  wrong.

1425
01:28:11,255 --> 01:28:11,625
Speaker 8:  It's just,

1426
01:28:12,585 --> 01:28:16,465
Speaker 5:  I I agree that we should a, in principle, we should not be

1427
01:28:16,785 --> 01:28:19,265
Speaker 5:  training people to think of these things as humans. I understand why the

1428
01:28:19,385 --> 01:28:21,705
Speaker 5:  companies want you to do that. And I think it is bad and they should stop.

1429
01:28:22,305 --> 01:28:26,265
Speaker 5:  I also think like the idea that

1430
01:28:26,265 --> 01:28:30,105
Speaker 5:  maybe it should seem like some cool weird alien bean creature

1431
01:28:30,165 --> 01:28:33,985
Speaker 5:  is like maybe closer and right. And there's all kinds of

1432
01:28:34,185 --> 01:28:37,865
Speaker 5:  interesting examples in science fiction of these like weird objects. Like

1433
01:28:37,865 --> 01:28:40,705
Speaker 5:  I was just watching E Leo, the Pixar movie that just came out that nobody

1434
01:28:40,805 --> 01:28:44,745
Speaker 5:  saw delightful movie by the way. Highly recommend it. And there's this really

1435
01:28:44,745 --> 01:28:48,185
Speaker 5:  cute little like blobby alien that just like follows him around through most

1436
01:28:48,185 --> 01:28:51,345
Speaker 5:  of the movie. And I was like, that's what I want my aa to be like, forget

1437
01:28:51,345 --> 01:28:54,425
Speaker 5:  the rest of this. Just gimme a little jellyfish looking alien that talks

1438
01:28:54,425 --> 01:28:57,425
Speaker 5:  to me in every language known to man. And I, and I'm in

1439
01:28:57,805 --> 01:29:00,185
Speaker 8:  The floating around part would be great too. Oh yeah.

1440
01:29:01,295 --> 01:29:04,025
Speaker 5:  Sort of just like kick it up here next to you. It just hangs out. Yeah.

1441
01:29:04,495 --> 01:29:05,065
Speaker 11:  It's it's

1442
01:29:05,065 --> 01:29:08,545
Speaker 5:  The dream. Yeah. But copilot portraits is, is not it.

1443
01:29:09,185 --> 01:29:13,105
Speaker 5:  That's that's all I know for sure. While we're on the subject of

1444
01:29:13,345 --> 01:29:17,185
Speaker 5:  slightly creepy ai, my first lightning round thing is this new

1445
01:29:17,525 --> 01:29:20,705
Speaker 5:  SOA app that OpenAI put out This week and this slightly

1446
01:29:20,765 --> 01:29:21,185
Speaker 11:  Creepy,

1447
01:29:22,015 --> 01:29:25,905
Speaker 5:  It's fair. We're gonna talk more about SOA

1448
01:29:25,905 --> 01:29:29,825
Speaker 5:  over time because it's still the, it's in an invite only app that

1449
01:29:30,015 --> 01:29:33,745
Speaker 5:  most people have not had access to. But I think the idea is essentially

1450
01:29:34,175 --> 01:29:37,625
Speaker 5:  it's TikTok, but everything is AI generated is what it's gonna be. This is

1451
01:29:37,945 --> 01:29:41,225
Speaker 5:  like the, the vibes app that meta put out, which is essentially the same

1452
01:29:41,225 --> 01:29:44,185
Speaker 5:  thing. It's just like, what if Facebook was all ai, which AI would point

1453
01:29:44,185 --> 01:29:46,425
Speaker 5:  out, it's just what Facebook is now. But also

1454
01:29:48,005 --> 01:29:51,745
Speaker 5:  the, this question of like, will you as a person want to spend your days

1455
01:29:51,745 --> 01:29:55,585
Speaker 5:  scrolling through a bunch of AI generated content is the big question that

1456
01:29:55,585 --> 01:29:59,305
Speaker 5:  these companies are trying to answer right now. But the, the thing that

1457
01:29:59,465 --> 01:30:02,425
Speaker 5:  happened This week, two things that I think are really interesting, one is

1458
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:06,425
Speaker 5:  SOA two, the, the model that powers all of it appears to be

1459
01:30:07,365 --> 01:30:11,225
Speaker 5:  so good, it's going to be terrifying, like in, in some really big and

1460
01:30:11,225 --> 01:30:14,785
Speaker 5:  important ways. And I think we've been burned by how good the demo videos

1461
01:30:14,845 --> 01:30:18,345
Speaker 5:  are before. So I, I am withholding a lot of judgment

1462
01:30:18,515 --> 01:30:21,425
Speaker 5:  until we actually see what this stuff looks like in real life.

1463
01:30:22,325 --> 01:30:26,025
Speaker 5:  But like the, the videos that we've seen are nuts.

1464
01:30:26,135 --> 01:30:29,585
Speaker 5:  Like truly I think, I don't know how you guys feel, but I'm like, I'm a relatively

1465
01:30:29,585 --> 01:30:33,105
Speaker 5:  sophisticated viewer of both real and

1466
01:30:33,545 --> 01:30:36,705
Speaker 5:  artificial stuff And I had a really hard time distinguishing what was in

1467
01:30:36,725 --> 01:30:40,465
Speaker 5:  was not AI from these things. And like people talking

1468
01:30:40,645 --> 01:30:44,625
Speaker 5:  and recognizable people in these videos. Which goes to the

1469
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:47,425
Speaker 5:  other thing I think is really interesting, which is this idea that is inside

1470
01:30:47,425 --> 01:30:51,385
Speaker 5:  of the SOS app called cameos, which is basically the,

1471
01:30:51,405 --> 01:30:55,225
Speaker 5:  the idea is that you as a person upload a video that you take

1472
01:30:55,225 --> 01:30:59,185
Speaker 5:  on your phone or whatever. You upload a video to the app with your face

1473
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:03,155
Speaker 5:  in it. And what that then does is give everyone else on the

1474
01:31:03,155 --> 01:31:07,015
Speaker 5:  app permission to use your face in generated

1475
01:31:07,015 --> 01:31:10,175
Speaker 5:  videos. And, and there's a really interesting like permission structure in

1476
01:31:10,175 --> 01:31:13,815
Speaker 5:  that, which is like, it can't do anything until I add myself

1477
01:31:14,275 --> 01:31:18,175
Speaker 5:  to the corpus of data. But once I do, I become fair

1478
01:31:18,175 --> 01:31:21,655
Speaker 5:  game in the model with which to, you know, do any kind of deep fake you want.

1479
01:31:22,095 --> 01:31:24,375
Speaker 5:  I just think that's a really interesting way to think about this kind of

1480
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:28,255
Speaker 5:  permission that is messy and problematic in a whole bunch of ways, but is

1481
01:31:29,175 --> 01:31:33,045
Speaker 5:  apparently what they're headed for. But it does feel like I, I have been

1482
01:31:33,485 --> 01:31:37,405
Speaker 5:  reluctant to fe to say and feel like we are heading towards some, like

1483
01:31:37,455 --> 01:31:41,085
Speaker 5:  truth is unknowable and everything is a disaster, but like looking at these

1484
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:45,005
Speaker 5:  Sora videos, it was unnerving. I don't know, did either of you

1485
01:31:45,005 --> 01:31:46,165
Speaker 5:  experience that looking at this stuff?

1486
01:31:46,635 --> 01:31:50,405
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I did. See, I don't know, I think, I don't know if it was Sam

1487
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:54,405
Speaker 11:  Altman or somebody else, they posted like a video of like an AI

1488
01:31:54,405 --> 01:31:58,325
Speaker 11:  generated gymnastics routine or like a clip from that. And

1489
01:31:58,715 --> 01:32:02,685
Speaker 11:  like AI has notoriously like had trouble generating this 'cause

1490
01:32:02,685 --> 01:32:05,645
Speaker 11:  it shows like gymnast with like three arms or something. Yeah.

1491
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:09,485
Speaker 5:  They'll do like one normal flip and then they like do like a weird fly off

1492
01:32:09,485 --> 01:32:10,685
Speaker 5:  of the map. Yeah.

1493
01:32:11,665 --> 01:32:15,165
Speaker 11:  But it seems like, so like I didn't, it looked like a real

1494
01:32:15,395 --> 01:32:19,285
Speaker 11:  clip, like this one looked legit and it was kind of

1495
01:32:19,335 --> 01:32:20,765
Speaker 11:  unsettling and just

1496
01:32:22,905 --> 01:32:23,525
Speaker 11:  not great.

1497
01:32:25,005 --> 01:32:28,965
Speaker 8:  I think one of the, I mean it's terrifying that all of this is getting

1498
01:32:29,025 --> 01:32:32,925
Speaker 8:  so real, but one of the, the kind of the flip side that makes it even

1499
01:32:32,955 --> 01:32:36,885
Speaker 8:  more terrifying to me is that when the fake

1500
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:40,205
Speaker 8:  stuff gets so real, it means that no one believes the real stuff either.

1501
01:32:40,205 --> 01:32:43,965
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It's like the fake news dichotomy that we've ended up in.

1502
01:32:43,995 --> 01:32:47,725
Speaker 8:  It's like, you know, you've got to trust your sources, which is always something

1503
01:32:47,725 --> 01:32:51,005
Speaker 8:  you've, you've, you know, reliable sources. But with this, it's like

1504
01:32:51,905 --> 01:32:55,445
Speaker 8:  if you don't believe, if you can't believe anything anymore

1505
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:59,405
Speaker 8:  and that just puts you in like an existential crisis. Like my daughter's

1506
01:32:59,845 --> 01:33:03,485
Speaker 8:  14 and she spends a fair amount of on time on TikTok and she

1507
01:33:03,785 --> 01:33:07,565
Speaker 8:  can tell right away when something's ai. It's like, it's now like a new skill

1508
01:33:07,565 --> 01:33:11,365
Speaker 8:  that our youth are learning. Totally. Which is a good skill. But it's, I

1509
01:33:11,465 --> 01:33:15,005
Speaker 8:  I'm, but this is what I've said to her. It's like, is there gonna be a point

1510
01:33:15,005 --> 01:33:18,725
Speaker 8:  where you can't tell the difference and when you get to that point,

1511
01:33:19,195 --> 01:33:20,205
Speaker 8:  nothing is real.

1512
01:33:21,545 --> 01:33:25,525
Speaker 5:  You know, that was this the SOA two videos and again these, these

1513
01:33:25,525 --> 01:33:28,485
Speaker 5:  are just demo videos. Like God only knows how accurate this is to what most

1514
01:33:28,485 --> 01:33:32,405
Speaker 5:  people's actual experience will be. That would, these are the first time

1515
01:33:32,405 --> 01:33:35,885
Speaker 5:  that I have looked at them And I like, I've had to watch them

1516
01:33:35,915 --> 01:33:39,365
Speaker 5:  several times before you could clock anything that looked like ai, anything.

1517
01:33:39,365 --> 01:33:43,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And like maybe the youths will be better at this than, than

1518
01:33:43,225 --> 01:33:47,085
Speaker 5:  we are like, and hopefully they will be. But, but it, I I

1519
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:50,885
Speaker 5:  would've said we were a long way away from it being

1520
01:33:51,585 --> 01:33:55,325
Speaker 5:  really impossible for anyone to tell and now suddenly

1521
01:33:55,385 --> 01:33:58,365
Speaker 5:  it feels like it's closer than I realized. Yeah. Which is pretty scary.

1522
01:33:58,675 --> 01:33:58,965
Speaker 11:  Yeah.

1523
01:34:00,345 --> 01:34:03,635
Speaker 5:  Alright. That's my deep existential crisis for the week.

1524
01:34:04,495 --> 01:34:06,315
Speaker 5:  Jen, what's your, what's your first lightning round?

1525
01:34:07,105 --> 01:34:08,835
Speaker 8:  It's Fat Bear week.

1526
01:34:13,715 --> 01:34:15,515
Speaker 5:  I dunno why I'm surprised this is what you think.

1527
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:20,875
Speaker 8:  It's so exciting. I've missed the entire week thanks to Google and

1528
01:34:20,875 --> 01:34:24,475
Speaker 8:  Amazon, but I did get to see or hear

1529
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:28,555
Speaker 8:  thanks to Justine's wonderful reporting, most important story she's reported

1530
01:34:28,615 --> 01:34:29,675
Speaker 8:  on ever sorry

1531
01:34:31,465 --> 01:34:35,035
Speaker 8:  that there was a champion crowned. And now for those of you

1532
01:34:35,295 --> 01:34:38,115
Speaker 8:  who sadly are not familiar with that, their week,

1533
01:34:39,145 --> 01:34:43,075
Speaker 8:  it's one of my favorite weeks on the internet. It is when a

1534
01:34:43,325 --> 01:34:46,835
Speaker 8:  group in Alaska live streams

1535
01:34:47,255 --> 01:34:50,355
Speaker 8:  all of the brown bears coming to

1536
01:34:51,095 --> 01:34:54,715
Speaker 8:  the cat, my national park where they converge

1537
01:34:54,975 --> 01:34:58,020
Speaker 8:  on, I forget the name of the river, but one, one of the big rivers where

1538
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:01,975
Speaker 8:  all the salmon are, are jumping, jumping up and the bears

1539
01:35:01,975 --> 01:35:05,815
Speaker 8:  just stand there and let the salmon jump in their mouths. It's amazing. And

1540
01:35:05,815 --> 01:35:09,175
Speaker 8:  they're doing this to get fat for the winter, Sam,

1541
01:35:09,455 --> 01:35:10,095
Speaker 5:  Honestly. Yeah,

1542
01:35:10,515 --> 01:35:13,455
Speaker 8:  That's right. I feel that. So this group, it's a conservancy

1543
01:35:14,085 --> 01:35:17,255
Speaker 8:  nonprofit, it's called explore.org. They, they have

1544
01:35:17,645 --> 01:35:21,575
Speaker 8:  webcams set up and they track the bears when they arrive. 'cause

1545
01:35:21,575 --> 01:35:25,455
Speaker 8:  they arrive relatively, you know, normal healthy bear looking.

1546
01:35:26,315 --> 01:35:29,415
Speaker 8:  And then over the time they get fatter and fatter and fatter because they're

1547
01:35:29,415 --> 01:35:33,175
Speaker 8:  just eating salmon. Eating salmon. And you get to vote on the champion

1548
01:35:33,555 --> 01:35:37,255
Speaker 8:  fat bear. And this winner this year was Chunk,

1549
01:35:37,545 --> 01:35:41,495
Speaker 8:  which is a great name. Yes. Bear 32. And it's

1550
01:35:41,495 --> 01:35:44,975
Speaker 8:  just the most delightful thing on the internet. Like I spent most of my summer

1551
01:35:45,455 --> 01:35:49,175
Speaker 8:  watching the Eagles and in the Nest in

1552
01:35:49,175 --> 01:35:52,935
Speaker 8:  California that was live streamed. There were these three and then

1553
01:35:52,995 --> 01:35:56,775
Speaker 8:  two baby eagles that were hatched and you got to watch them get raised

1554
01:35:56,995 --> 01:36:00,775
Speaker 8:  and then fly the nest and oh it was so amazing.

1555
01:36:00,915 --> 01:36:04,855
Speaker 8:  And then this watching brown bears coming to the

1556
01:36:04,855 --> 01:36:08,735
Speaker 8:  rivers and eat feeding and fighting and like, there's a lot of, you know,

1557
01:36:08,735 --> 01:36:12,655
Speaker 8:  it's like real housewives type stuff going on. And

1558
01:36:12,735 --> 01:36:16,255
Speaker 8:  I literally, most years I will just, I have two monitors and one monitor

1559
01:36:16,725 --> 01:36:20,255
Speaker 8:  will be live feeds at brown bears in Alaska eating salmon.

1560
01:36:20,675 --> 01:36:24,455
Speaker 8:  And it's just so soothing and great and fun and I'm so, I was so

1561
01:36:24,455 --> 01:36:27,695
Speaker 8:  excited. I was excited. But chunk weighing in at

1562
01:36:27,795 --> 01:36:31,135
Speaker 8:  1200 pounds. Wow. An impressive,

1563
01:36:32,035 --> 01:36:35,535
Speaker 8:  that's a chunk he got, one of the reasons he won, I think he got the sympathy

1564
01:36:35,535 --> 01:36:39,095
Speaker 8:  vote because he had sadly had a broken jaw. Oh. So,

1565
01:36:39,915 --> 01:36:43,695
Speaker 8:  and you know, any kind of injury like that could be technically

1566
01:36:43,745 --> 01:36:47,255
Speaker 8:  could definitely be fatal for an animal if it's not able to feed. And then

1567
01:36:47,255 --> 01:36:50,695
Speaker 8:  the winter comes. 'cause what they, what bears do, obviously they go and

1568
01:36:50,695 --> 01:36:54,455
Speaker 8:  hibernate for the winter and they need all the extra blubber from the

1569
01:36:54,455 --> 01:36:58,255
Speaker 8:  salmon to keep them through the winter. And if they don't eat enough they

1570
01:36:58,255 --> 01:37:02,095
Speaker 8:  could die. So it's, you know, it's real survival of the fishes out there,

1571
01:37:02,575 --> 01:37:04,695
Speaker 8:  but also great YouTube viewing.

1572
01:37:05,405 --> 01:37:08,215
Speaker 5:  Very good. We all root for chunk. My favorite thing about this story was

1573
01:37:08,215 --> 01:37:12,055
Speaker 5:  there was, there was a comment on Justine's story,

1574
01:37:12,055 --> 01:37:15,415
Speaker 5:  which is very good and we'll put in the show notes. There was basically like,

1575
01:37:15,575 --> 01:37:18,055
Speaker 5:  I don't know why this is on The Verge dot com, but I like it. And somebody

1576
01:37:18,055 --> 01:37:21,175
Speaker 5:  else just responded to that comment and it was like webcams or tech. Yes.

1577
01:37:21,805 --> 01:37:25,295
Speaker 8:  Hell yeah. I mean that, yeah, that was why I, I was like, I asked Richard,

1578
01:37:25,915 --> 01:37:28,815
Speaker 8:  the new editor, I was like, can I post about the Eagle Nest? And he's like,

1579
01:37:29,395 --> 01:37:33,335
Speaker 8:  but it's, but it's in a webcam. I could use a webcam. And

1580
01:37:33,565 --> 01:37:34,375
Speaker 8:  Baby Eagles

1581
01:37:35,285 --> 01:37:38,935
Speaker 5:  Neli in the past has approved stories because there's a phone there and that's

1582
01:37:38,965 --> 01:37:41,895
Speaker 5:  good enough. Sometimes it's, sometimes it's good enough. It's, this is what

1583
01:37:41,895 --> 01:37:43,375
Speaker 5:  tech, we do whatever we want. This

1584
01:37:43,375 --> 01:37:45,135
Speaker 8:  Is the good stuff tech brings to us.

1585
01:37:45,535 --> 01:37:48,735
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent. I love it. I cannot recommend chunk enough to everyone.

1586
01:37:49,765 --> 01:37:50,895
Speaker 5:  Emma, what's your next one?

1587
01:37:51,165 --> 01:37:51,455
Speaker 8:  Yeah,

1588
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:55,925
Speaker 11:  So my next one was that Waymo now supports YouTube

1589
01:37:55,925 --> 01:37:57,325
Speaker 11:  music. And

1590
01:37:58,845 --> 01:38:01,925
Speaker 11:  I chose this because I got to go into Waymo for the first time

1591
01:38:02,685 --> 01:38:04,205
Speaker 11:  recently. And Ooh, you're

1592
01:38:04,205 --> 01:38:05,285
Speaker 5:  Just living in the future over here

1593
01:38:05,865 --> 01:38:09,645
Speaker 8:  Is great. Were that ads in the, in the car? Like, oh,

1594
01:38:10,165 --> 01:38:13,085
Speaker 11:  I now, I don't even remember that because I was too, I was too busy like

1595
01:38:13,085 --> 01:38:14,325
Speaker 11:  staring at like this, the

1596
01:38:14,565 --> 01:38:17,725
Speaker 8:  Steering wheel. Well I hate about New York cabs, the ads, I can never turn

1597
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:18,925
Speaker 8:  them off that, you

1598
01:38:18,925 --> 01:38:19,685
Speaker 11:  Know. Oh yeah.

1599
01:38:20,325 --> 01:38:21,845
Speaker 8:  They don't have ads in Waymo's though.

1600
01:38:22,325 --> 01:38:22,965
Speaker 11:  I don't remember.

1601
01:38:24,545 --> 01:38:27,125
Speaker 8:  I'm sure they're coming if they don't yet. Exactly.

1602
01:38:27,385 --> 01:38:30,365
Speaker 5:  How was your Waymo experience? Was it everything you dreamed of?

1603
01:38:30,745 --> 01:38:33,965
Speaker 11:  It was actually like really cool And I

1604
01:38:34,825 --> 01:38:38,765
Speaker 11:  was just like, they integrated like Spotify earlier, now it's

1605
01:38:38,765 --> 01:38:42,445
Speaker 11:  YouTube music. But I just wanted to like say that the music that you

1606
01:38:42,515 --> 01:38:45,845
Speaker 11:  hear when you first like get into the Waymo, it's very like soothing

1607
01:38:46,815 --> 01:38:49,595
Speaker 11:  and it's like, I can't imagine like,

1608
01:38:50,625 --> 01:38:54,435
Speaker 11:  like rocking out in there because I feel like you need the

1609
01:38:54,755 --> 01:38:55,715
Speaker 11:  relaxing music. So is

1610
01:38:55,715 --> 01:38:56,755
Speaker 8:  It like elevator music

1611
01:38:57,385 --> 01:39:00,955
Speaker 11:  Kind of, it's like lo-fi music. Like you just need that so you don't like

1612
01:39:00,955 --> 01:39:03,875
Speaker 11:  freak out that nobody's driving the car and like

1613
01:39:05,035 --> 01:39:08,435
Speaker 11:  I feel like it's very, it's very relaxing. 'cause sometimes at one point,

1614
01:39:08,435 --> 01:39:12,395
Speaker 11:  like the way Waymo was making a right turn And I was just like, holy crap.

1615
01:39:12,505 --> 01:39:15,075
Speaker 11:  Like I don't know what's gonna happen to me after this.

1616
01:39:15,415 --> 01:39:15,635
Speaker 8:  But

1617
01:39:15,985 --> 01:39:18,755
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I feel like every, everybody I know who takes a Waymo describes their

1618
01:39:18,755 --> 01:39:21,435
Speaker 5:  first experience as like, oh my God, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die, I'm gonna

1619
01:39:21,435 --> 01:39:24,115
Speaker 5:  die. And then by about the third one you kind of just get used to it.

1620
01:39:24,465 --> 01:39:28,355
Speaker 11:  Yeah, yeah. It's true. But yeah, I mean I just think

1621
01:39:28,555 --> 01:39:32,235
Speaker 11:  I could totally like see like how people do jam out in the Waymo. 'cause

1622
01:39:32,235 --> 01:39:35,275
Speaker 11:  nobody's in the car and you can just like kind of party in there and go

1623
01:39:35,275 --> 01:39:35,955
Speaker 11:  crazy. But

1624
01:39:37,475 --> 01:39:40,635
Speaker 11:  I just, I do like the relaxing music that they play by default.

1625
01:39:41,465 --> 01:39:42,795
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I tend to agree that like,

1626
01:39:44,355 --> 01:39:48,135
Speaker 5:  it should probably not try to distract me with my favorite

1627
01:39:48,145 --> 01:39:52,055
Speaker 5:  songs, but I also feel like, listen, Waymo and YouTube owned

1628
01:39:52,055 --> 01:39:55,455
Speaker 5:  by the same company. Yes. And, and these people need to have a meeting with

1629
01:39:55,455 --> 01:39:59,295
Speaker 5:  each other that so that it knows when I get in the car and it plays the

1630
01:39:59,295 --> 01:40:02,895
Speaker 5:  music that I like, the second I step into the va, this is the most obvious

1631
01:40:02,895 --> 01:40:06,375
Speaker 5:  thing in the world and Google will never do it And I will just be angry about

1632
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:06,655
Speaker 5:  it forever.

1633
01:40:06,805 --> 01:40:10,655
Speaker 11:  Yeah. I was, that's all I've used at one of the comments on the quick post

1634
01:40:10,715 --> 01:40:14,415
Speaker 11:  for this, because somebody was like, of course, it's like the most Google

1635
01:40:14,415 --> 01:40:18,135
Speaker 11:  thing ever to integrate their own service. Like after doing

1636
01:40:18,135 --> 01:40:20,695
Speaker 11:  Spotify and iHeartRadio. Yeah.

1637
01:40:20,865 --> 01:40:24,855
Speaker 5:  Every, yeah. Like, oh God, every, every once a year. Everyone

1638
01:40:25,075 --> 01:40:28,295
Speaker 5:  who works for Google should be required to all meet each other. Like just

1639
01:40:29,955 --> 01:40:30,175
Speaker 11:  Yes.

1640
01:40:30,715 --> 01:40:32,495
Speaker 8:  In a Google Home. Yes.

1641
01:40:34,325 --> 01:40:38,255
Speaker 5:  Exactly. All right. My next one is, I, I mean this

1642
01:40:38,255 --> 01:40:42,015
Speaker 5:  sincerely maybe the single most exciting product announcement for me

1643
01:40:42,015 --> 01:40:45,775
Speaker 5:  personally that has happened this year, which is that Spotify

1644
01:40:46,085 --> 01:40:49,815
Speaker 5:  will now let you exclude a single song from

1645
01:40:49,925 --> 01:40:52,655
Speaker 5:  your algorithm and taste profile on Spotify.

1646
01:40:53,865 --> 01:40:57,525
Speaker 5:  So recently I have a, I have a two and a half year old

1647
01:40:57,745 --> 01:41:01,685
Speaker 5:  who only wants to watch Toy Story 100% of the

1648
01:41:01,685 --> 01:41:05,565
Speaker 5:  time this morning. I'm pretty sure he faked sick for I think the first

1649
01:41:05,565 --> 01:41:08,285
Speaker 5:  time ever. So that he, because he wanted to stay home and watch TV. And I

1650
01:41:08,305 --> 01:41:10,645
Speaker 5:  saw through him and he's not here. But anyway,

1651
01:41:12,305 --> 01:41:16,245
Speaker 5:  his favorite song on Earth is the third song from the

1652
01:41:16,265 --> 01:41:20,165
Speaker 5:  Toy Story soundtrack, which is called I Will Go Sailing No More. And

1653
01:41:20,225 --> 01:41:24,205
Speaker 5:  it is, it's the one where Buzz finds out he's a toy

1654
01:41:24,425 --> 01:41:28,245
Speaker 5:  and then tries to, tries to fly out the window and falls down. And Arthur,

1655
01:41:28,345 --> 01:41:32,005
Speaker 5:  my son, likes to stand there with his buzz and act out this whole thing as

1656
01:41:32,005 --> 01:41:35,885
Speaker 5:  we play the song 700 times in a row. So all of this is to say, I will

1657
01:41:35,885 --> 01:41:38,605
Speaker 5:  go sailing no more is going to be the number one song on my Spotify wrapped

1658
01:41:38,605 --> 01:41:41,925
Speaker 5:  this year. It's going to be the song. All of my other

1659
01:41:41,925 --> 01:41:45,285
Speaker 5:  recommendations are based on, I get Discover weekly recommendations every

1660
01:41:45,285 --> 01:41:49,245
Speaker 5:  week now by bands called like Fart Poop, poop, pee Pee. And like

1661
01:41:49,515 --> 01:41:52,725
Speaker 5:  it's just, this is my life now. And so the idea that I'm going to be able

1662
01:41:52,725 --> 01:41:56,405
Speaker 5:  to go in and say, exclude this from my profile, this is not representative

1663
01:41:56,545 --> 01:42:00,525
Speaker 5:  of my actual taste is so exciting and every other service needs

1664
01:42:00,525 --> 01:42:03,925
Speaker 5:  to have this. Like, if I watch a YouTube video that I don't want to

1665
01:42:03,925 --> 01:42:07,445
Speaker 5:  influence the rest of my YouTube videos. I want to be able to be like, I

1666
01:42:07,445 --> 01:42:11,205
Speaker 5:  didn't like that one. Pretend you never saw that. I saw it. Like I want that

1667
01:42:11,205 --> 01:42:14,485
Speaker 5:  on every service. And it makes me so happy that it exists on Spotify.

1668
01:42:14,715 --> 01:42:17,925
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Oh, completely agree. I need it on Netflix. 'cause every, for some

1669
01:42:17,925 --> 01:42:20,645
Speaker 8:  reason, even though my kids have their own profiles, my daughter loves to

1670
01:42:20,645 --> 01:42:24,565
Speaker 8:  watch all her sort of anime k-pop type

1671
01:42:24,565 --> 01:42:28,365
Speaker 8:  movies and shows on my, and literally everything I have is

1672
01:42:28,855 --> 01:42:32,835
Speaker 8:  Asian influenced for all of my watch list now. And it's like, some

1673
01:42:32,835 --> 01:42:36,595
Speaker 8:  of it's great, but it's, you know, I also, you know, gimme a good CSI come

1674
01:42:36,595 --> 01:42:40,355
Speaker 8:  on. But yeah, I agree. I had the same issue with Spotify. I ended up having

1675
01:42:40,355 --> 01:42:44,115
Speaker 8:  to get the separate accounts with the kids and spend the extra money you

1676
01:42:44,315 --> 01:42:46,115
Speaker 8:  you get that's in your future. David,

1677
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:50,235
Speaker 5:  I just want the button. I want one button that says, this is not the person

1678
01:42:51,035 --> 01:42:54,235
Speaker 5:  I aspire to be. Take this out of my profile. And then I want another button

1679
01:42:54,235 --> 01:42:57,435
Speaker 5:  that is like, I would like to be more like the person who watches and listens

1680
01:42:57,435 --> 01:43:00,315
Speaker 5:  to this. Please show me more This, more of these. Yes. Yeah. Like when I,

1681
01:43:00,315 --> 01:43:04,195
Speaker 5:  when I come across like a, like a gardening video on TikTok, I

1682
01:43:04,195 --> 01:43:07,395
Speaker 5:  want a button that is like, hell yeah. More of these. You know what I mean?

1683
01:43:07,655 --> 01:43:11,155
Speaker 5:  Yes. Yeah. I, I want to be the person who watches this video. So show me

1684
01:43:11,155 --> 01:43:11,755
Speaker 5:  more of this video.

1685
01:43:12,815 --> 01:43:16,635
Speaker 8:  No, I agree. The opt out great button should be everywhere. Yeah,

1686
01:43:17,105 --> 01:43:20,635
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The, I didn't watch this because I liked it. Please leave me alone

1687
01:43:20,635 --> 01:43:24,515
Speaker 5:  with it. Button needs to exist everywhere and I'm thrilled that

1688
01:43:24,515 --> 01:43:25,315
Speaker 5:  it exists on Spotify.

1689
01:43:27,015 --> 01:43:29,355
Speaker 5:  Jen, you're up last, what's, what's your last thing? Yeah,

1690
01:43:29,355 --> 01:43:32,355
Speaker 8:  Just to bring it back full circle I guess to all the Amazon announcements,

1691
01:43:32,455 --> 01:43:36,155
Speaker 8:  we didn't dive into this because there was a big surprise, actually this

1692
01:43:36,155 --> 01:43:39,955
Speaker 8:  was quite a big surprise for the ring ring. The

1693
01:43:40,035 --> 01:43:43,035
Speaker 8:  Amazon owned video doorbell camera company,

1694
01:43:43,845 --> 01:43:47,475
Speaker 8:  Jamie Siminoff, who has recently returned, came out on stage at the event

1695
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:51,885
Speaker 8:  and introduced a boatload of new cameras. Nine in total,

1696
01:43:52,985 --> 01:43:56,845
Speaker 8:  all 2K and 4K, which they've never done before. So 4K is

1697
01:43:56,885 --> 01:44:00,805
Speaker 8:  a huge jump. So you know, they're just leapfrogging the nest there

1698
01:44:00,825 --> 01:44:04,805
Speaker 8:  who just went to TK 2K, now they've gone to 4K and there's a new

1699
01:44:05,035 --> 01:44:07,405
Speaker 8:  ring battery, sorry, a ring doorbell.

1700
01:44:09,155 --> 01:44:13,005
Speaker 8:  There's two versions of that. 2K and 4K. These are wired, they're all

1701
01:44:13,055 --> 01:44:17,005
Speaker 8:  wired cameras. Again, the higher resolution more, you need

1702
01:44:17,005 --> 01:44:20,605
Speaker 8:  a bit more power. This is all feeding into the Alexa plus AI as well.

1703
01:44:21,065 --> 01:44:23,885
Speaker 8:  So you've got two new doorbell cameras, new design.

1704
01:44:24,915 --> 01:44:28,605
Speaker 8:  Nice. Quite sleek, little slimmer, still

1705
01:44:28,745 --> 01:44:32,525
Speaker 8:  not a good design I'm afraid. But it looks like a doorbell.

1706
01:44:32,525 --> 01:44:35,925
Speaker 8:  That's what Jamie OV said to me afterwards when I commented on this. I'm

1707
01:44:35,925 --> 01:44:39,645
Speaker 8:  like, this was a chance for a big redesign. He is like, it looks like a doorbell.

1708
01:44:39,745 --> 01:44:42,565
Speaker 8:  That's what it needs to do. Fair enough. So you, your doorbell isn't something

1709
01:44:42,625 --> 01:44:46,565
Speaker 8:  you use. Which is a good point. That is a good point. But

1710
01:44:46,725 --> 01:44:50,565
Speaker 8:  yeah, so these come in. You've also got new floodlight camera, new outdoor

1711
01:44:50,565 --> 01:44:54,325
Speaker 8:  camera, new indoor camera that are all 4K. There are 2K

1712
01:44:54,325 --> 01:44:57,565
Speaker 8:  options for some of these as well plus POE options,

1713
01:44:58,175 --> 01:45:00,965
Speaker 8:  which are more for professional installs. But I know some of our listeners

1714
01:45:01,505 --> 01:45:05,445
Speaker 8:  are handy with the sort of the more permanent installs. POE is a great

1715
01:45:05,885 --> 01:45:09,725
Speaker 8:  solution if you can do it. So these are all, these are all

1716
01:45:09,725 --> 01:45:13,165
Speaker 8:  announced along with something called Retinal Vision,

1717
01:45:13,975 --> 01:45:17,125
Speaker 8:  which sounds like the worst. I'm sorry, it's the worst Mark. That's just

1718
01:45:17,125 --> 01:45:20,525
Speaker 8:  vision. That's all. That's what vision is. I know, I thought it was like

1719
01:45:20,545 --> 01:45:24,125
Speaker 8:  an eye scanner at first. I'm like, yeah, I know. I was like, that would be

1720
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:27,925
Speaker 8:  cool. Like, so you are, it does what

1721
01:45:28,955 --> 01:45:31,565
Speaker 8:  it's like, do I need to go to the eye doctor? What's going on? What's going

1722
01:45:31,565 --> 01:45:35,165
Speaker 8:  on? Basically it's a fancy way of describing

1723
01:45:35,665 --> 01:45:39,405
Speaker 8:  ai enhancing the video feed. So you're supposed,

1724
01:45:39,585 --> 01:45:43,285
Speaker 8:  you will supposedly get much better video quality, which

1725
01:45:43,285 --> 01:45:47,165
Speaker 8:  again is feeding into the Alexa Plus and the ai. So you can

1726
01:45:47,165 --> 01:45:51,005
Speaker 8:  get new, there's text descriptions now on the Ring video

1727
01:45:51,405 --> 01:45:54,645
Speaker 8:  doorbells and the cameras. So you'll get a description of what's happened

1728
01:45:54,645 --> 01:45:57,965
Speaker 8:  as opposed to suggest, hey there's, you know, right now you might get person

1729
01:45:58,485 --> 01:46:02,285
Speaker 8:  detected or motion detected and you will also, because they

1730
01:46:02,285 --> 01:46:05,845
Speaker 8:  introduced facial recognition for the first time to ring cameras.

1731
01:46:06,345 --> 01:46:09,645
Speaker 8:  So you now could get an alert that says, Hey David's at your front door.

1732
01:46:09,945 --> 01:46:13,605
Speaker 8:  If you're gonna come visit sometime, that would be great. So

1733
01:46:13,665 --> 01:46:16,925
Speaker 8:  facial recogni and like tele has arrived at your front door, Kelly has arrived

1734
01:46:16,945 --> 01:46:20,525
Speaker 8:  at your front door. Yes. They've come to make sure you are watching your

1735
01:46:20,525 --> 01:46:20,805
Speaker 8:  tele.

1736
01:46:22,705 --> 01:46:26,605
Speaker 8:  So this was a hu all these like big upgrades for Ring that are

1737
01:46:26,605 --> 01:46:29,885
Speaker 8:  things that people have been wanting for a while, especially the new increased

1738
01:46:30,125 --> 01:46:33,925
Speaker 8:  resolution, the facial recognition feature. You know, some people love it,

1739
01:46:34,035 --> 01:46:38,005
Speaker 8:  some people don't. Obviously you don't have to turn this on. It is all

1740
01:46:38,005 --> 01:46:41,925
Speaker 8:  cloud process, but whereas some, I think Nest does most of its,

1741
01:46:42,215 --> 01:46:45,925
Speaker 8:  apple does most of its local. I think some of Nest is local Google

1742
01:46:46,055 --> 01:46:49,325
Speaker 8:  Nests. So that, that was all interesting. But the star of the show

1743
01:46:49,865 --> 01:46:53,605
Speaker 8:  was, I would, was the dog. As we

1744
01:46:53,605 --> 01:46:57,525
Speaker 8:  mentioned, they do, you know, the tech companies do love

1745
01:46:57,525 --> 01:47:01,005
Speaker 8:  to use pets and, and pets and kids to, to keep us interested.

1746
01:47:01,505 --> 01:47:05,325
Speaker 8:  But there's a new feature called Search Party. And what this

1747
01:47:05,395 --> 01:47:08,845
Speaker 8:  does is when you lose, if you lose your dog

1748
01:47:09,825 --> 01:47:13,805
Speaker 8:  or just Dogs Now Cats coming soon, you

1749
01:47:13,805 --> 01:47:17,605
Speaker 8:  can send out an alert in your, in the Ring Neighbors

1750
01:47:17,605 --> 01:47:20,245
Speaker 8:  app, which is a separate app. It's kinda like next door.

1751
01:47:20,635 --> 01:47:23,445
Speaker 5:  Like next door, but only for crime and yeah.

1752
01:47:23,745 --> 01:47:27,245
Speaker 8:  Yes. Yeah. Any ring cameras in your

1753
01:47:27,245 --> 01:47:31,195
Speaker 8:  neighborhood will get so that they can,

1754
01:47:31,375 --> 01:47:35,115
Speaker 8:  the, the image can be recognized, the image of your dog can be

1755
01:47:35,395 --> 01:47:38,955
Speaker 8:  recognized by any local cameras. And then if the

1756
01:47:39,175 --> 01:47:42,755
Speaker 8:  ai, this is all AI based, sees your dog on someone

1757
01:47:42,895 --> 01:47:46,715
Speaker 8:  else's camera, that ring owner will then get an alert saying,

1758
01:47:46,805 --> 01:47:50,115
Speaker 8:  we've spotted this lost dog on your camera.

1759
01:47:50,605 --> 01:47:54,515
Speaker 8:  Would you like to, you know, get in touch with the owner, take

1760
01:47:54,515 --> 01:47:57,675
Speaker 8:  the dog home, you know, they can then decide what they're gonna do. So the

1761
01:47:57,675 --> 01:48:00,755
Speaker 8:  idea is this AI, neighborhood AI is working

1762
01:48:01,495 --> 01:48:05,355
Speaker 8:  to help find your lost dog. So it, it's, it's a neat

1763
01:48:05,385 --> 01:48:09,275
Speaker 8:  idea. I was very excited when they first showed the dog on the

1764
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:12,915
Speaker 8:  screen thinking we are finally getting the Vet Pet Tracker

1765
01:48:13,105 --> 01:48:16,875
Speaker 8:  from 2019. But no, this is far more

1766
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:20,115
Speaker 8:  technically advanced Yeah. Than just a little neat

1767
01:48:20,695 --> 01:48:24,435
Speaker 8:  pet tracker, which was very cool 'cause it was one of the first

1768
01:48:24,435 --> 01:48:26,115
Speaker 8:  devices they announced for Sidewalk

1769
01:48:26,425 --> 01:48:29,955
Speaker 5:  What happened to Sidewalk. Like every, every time.

1770
01:48:30,265 --> 01:48:33,475
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like you say, you know, all the rings will talk to each other and I'm

1771
01:48:33,475 --> 01:48:37,275
Speaker 5:  like, oh, didn't Amazon make a, a big splash about

1772
01:48:37,295 --> 01:48:40,915
Speaker 5:  how it was gonna connect all of its devices and build a whole new internet

1773
01:48:40,935 --> 01:48:42,715
Speaker 5:  out of all of your connect? Is this that

1774
01:48:43,135 --> 01:48:46,795
Speaker 8:  No, this has got nothing to do with Sidewalk. Oh Chuck Jen, don't do that

1775
01:48:46,795 --> 01:48:47,755
Speaker 5:  To me. That's not nice.

1776
01:48:49,275 --> 01:48:53,195
Speaker 8:  I know, I, I think Sidewalk is a really interesting idea And I, that's

1777
01:48:53,195 --> 01:48:56,915
Speaker 8:  why I was excited about this pet tracker from six years ago. I was

1778
01:48:56,915 --> 01:49:00,875
Speaker 8:  excited six years ago making that clear because I've used a lot

1779
01:49:00,875 --> 01:49:04,675
Speaker 8:  of pet trackers and they use GPS or Cellular, which where I live, both of

1780
01:49:04,675 --> 01:49:07,955
Speaker 8:  which are very unreliable and also expensive.

1781
01:49:08,435 --> 01:49:12,155
Speaker 8:  Whereas the idea of the site of Sidewalk is it's a free low

1782
01:49:12,155 --> 01:49:16,075
Speaker 8:  power local network that uses already

1783
01:49:16,515 --> 01:49:20,435
Speaker 8:  existing infrastructure. All those many, many millions of echo devices out

1784
01:49:20,435 --> 01:49:24,035
Speaker 8:  there. But no one has really, nothing has really come of

1785
01:49:24,325 --> 01:49:28,155
Speaker 8:  developing products for Sidewalk. There are a few that came out but you

1786
01:49:28,155 --> 01:49:31,555
Speaker 8:  don't really hear much about them. Ring never did its Pet Tracker. I asked

1787
01:49:31,605 --> 01:49:35,075
Speaker 8:  Jamie about the pet tracker and he said, you know, I always, it was something

1788
01:49:35,075 --> 01:49:38,595
Speaker 8:  they wanted to do, but he said this is easier

1789
01:49:39,135 --> 01:49:42,835
Speaker 8:  in many ways because it's very hard to get a hundred percent penetration

1790
01:49:43,055 --> 01:49:46,995
Speaker 8:  on pets pet trackers. Whereas, you know, we have a lot of

1791
01:49:47,005 --> 01:49:50,405
Speaker 8:  of Ring doorbells already out there and this only works on outdoor cameras

1792
01:49:50,405 --> 01:49:54,285
Speaker 8:  obviously. So, but I don't know, I

1793
01:49:54,285 --> 01:49:57,165
Speaker 8:  mean you also have to have ring cameras, so whereas

1794
01:49:58,025 --> 01:50:01,645
Speaker 8:  that's probably likely it's got one of the lar larger market

1795
01:50:01,645 --> 01:50:05,365
Speaker 8:  penetrations that your neighborhood would have them. But yeah, it's, it's

1796
01:50:05,565 --> 01:50:09,405
Speaker 8:  kind of locking it into one ecosystem whereas, yeah, sidewalk Sidewalk

1797
01:50:09,555 --> 01:50:13,405
Speaker 8:  does work today. Like it, I have it use using it in my

1798
01:50:13,405 --> 01:50:17,125
Speaker 8:  home and it sends, it helps keep devices. No sending

1799
01:50:17,125 --> 01:50:20,645
Speaker 8:  notifications when the internet goes down. So when the internet goes down,

1800
01:50:20,685 --> 01:50:24,085
Speaker 8:  I still get alerts from my ring cameras because it's using Sidewalk.

1801
01:50:24,545 --> 01:50:28,085
Speaker 8:  It, it's a great system, it's a great network. It helps extend

1802
01:50:28,325 --> 01:50:31,725
Speaker 8:  connectivity outside of your home without using wifi. Sure. But

1803
01:50:32,195 --> 01:50:36,045
Speaker 8:  yeah, nothing, they don't seem to have done much with it recently. I'm hoping

1804
01:50:36,045 --> 01:50:37,645
Speaker 8:  to get an update one day. Fine.

1805
01:50:38,405 --> 01:50:41,565
Speaker 5:  Whatever. Haos, if you're listening, give me sidewalk, everything will be

1806
01:50:41,565 --> 01:50:45,165
Speaker 5:  fine. I'll say the search party thing is like in this context,

1807
01:50:45,165 --> 01:50:47,605
Speaker 5:  they're very smart to talk about this with pets because if they're like,

1808
01:50:47,605 --> 01:50:49,165
Speaker 5:  we will track your children around

1809
01:50:49,265 --> 01:50:50,645
Speaker 8:  The neighborhood, around the neighborhood, all

1810
01:50:50,645 --> 01:50:54,485
Speaker 5:  Of a sudden you have, I, we can follow you from house to house sounds really

1811
01:50:54,485 --> 01:50:57,605
Speaker 5:  creepy, but in the like, we're just going to use it to find your lost dog

1812
01:50:57,605 --> 01:51:00,365
Speaker 5:  way. It's like, oh this is, this is just a good thing. This is like welcome

1813
01:51:00,385 --> 01:51:04,245
Speaker 5:  to the double-sided coin of all of ring's. Everything.

1814
01:51:04,755 --> 01:51:08,525
Speaker 5:  It's like there's, if you look at it one way, it's nice and helpful

1815
01:51:08,705 --> 01:51:12,165
Speaker 5:  and good and if you look at it another way, it is just a horrible like

1816
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:15,605
Speaker 5:  dystopia for snitching on each other about everything.

1817
01:51:15,605 --> 01:51:18,725
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Especially now that you've added the facial recognition. Yeah.

1818
01:51:19,675 --> 01:51:23,565
Speaker 5:  Ring. This is what we do. I will say though Ring is at least in my neighborhood

1819
01:51:23,655 --> 01:51:27,085
Speaker 5:  everywhere. Yeah. Like we, we've, we spent the summer house hunting and it's

1820
01:51:27,085 --> 01:51:30,205
Speaker 5:  like just the, I started just clocking the percentage of places that we would

1821
01:51:30,205 --> 01:51:34,125
Speaker 5:  go that would have a ring and it's like, I mean a most

1822
01:51:34,145 --> 01:51:37,725
Speaker 5:  places now seem to have some kind of smart doorbell. Like I

1823
01:51:38,155 --> 01:51:41,645
Speaker 5:  more of, more often than not, I feel like the places we go have smart doorbells

1824
01:51:41,985 --> 01:51:45,805
Speaker 5:  and most of those are rings. Yeah. Like Ring is just the default player

1825
01:51:45,985 --> 01:51:47,525
Speaker 5:  in this category, which is nuts.

1826
01:51:48,115 --> 01:51:51,085
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Which is why I wish they would come up with some nicer designs

1827
01:51:51,805 --> 01:51:55,245
Speaker 8:  because you go to these gorgeous houses I'm sure, I mean you live in DC I'm

1828
01:51:55,245 --> 01:51:58,245
Speaker 8:  sure there's some lovely old houses there. And then they'll have this bright

1829
01:51:58,435 --> 01:52:01,845
Speaker 8:  stainless steel looking thing on with a big blue ring.

1830
01:52:02,565 --> 01:52:05,685
Speaker 8:  I know you can get face plates and there's the elite that can kind of be

1831
01:52:05,685 --> 01:52:09,125
Speaker 8:  installed properly, but most people don't do that. They just stick the big

1832
01:52:09,275 --> 01:52:13,085
Speaker 8:  battery powered one on the front door and it's glaring there at you. Which

1833
01:52:13,145 --> 01:52:17,005
Speaker 8:  is part of the point I suppose if you see it, you know you're be being watched.

1834
01:52:17,075 --> 01:52:17,365
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

1835
01:52:17,675 --> 01:52:20,805
Speaker 5:  It's something. Yeah. Emma, are you a smart home person?

1836
01:52:21,405 --> 01:52:24,645
Speaker 11:  I have a smart doorbell. It's not a ring, it's a ufe.

1837
01:52:25,505 --> 01:52:29,485
Speaker 11:  But yeah, there's a lot of rings around my neighborhood. I could definitely

1838
01:52:29,725 --> 01:52:30,725
Speaker 11:  vouch for that. Yeah.

1839
01:52:30,985 --> 01:52:34,965
Speaker 5:  The neighbor's app is just forever like a weird, sketchy, dystopian

1840
01:52:34,965 --> 01:52:35,845
Speaker 5:  place that I do not

1841
01:52:35,845 --> 01:52:36,405
Speaker 11:  Enjoy doing.

1842
01:52:38,805 --> 01:52:42,625
Speaker 5:  Alright, it's time for us to get outta here. We have, we have been talking

1843
01:52:42,675 --> 01:52:44,185
Speaker 5:  about ads for too long.

1844
01:52:46,055 --> 01:52:48,285
Speaker 5:  We've, we've gone way over. Thank you both for doing this. This was very

1845
01:52:48,285 --> 01:52:52,085
Speaker 5:  fun. I know it's been a, a truly nuts week and month

1846
01:52:52,085 --> 01:52:55,685
Speaker 5:  frankly for, for both of you. And it appears it's not over

1847
01:52:55,835 --> 01:52:59,045
Speaker 5:  like tech timber is a real thing, but I think October

1848
01:52:59,665 --> 01:53:03,485
Speaker 5:  is, is coming fast so it's, it's gonna be busy. We'll have to do this

1849
01:53:03,485 --> 01:53:06,445
Speaker 5:  more. Thank you both for doing this. This is a lot of fun. We'll be back

1850
01:53:06,445 --> 01:53:09,005
Speaker 5:  on Tuesday. Jen, you And I are gonna have some more smart home stuff to talk

1851
01:53:09,005 --> 01:53:09,205
Speaker 5:  about.

1852
01:53:11,065 --> 01:53:14,125
Speaker 5:  It all just keeps happening And I think actually you And I are gonna be doing

1853
01:53:14,125 --> 01:53:17,845
