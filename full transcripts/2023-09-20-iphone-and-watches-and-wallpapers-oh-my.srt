00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,400
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the action button. I'm

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,680
Speaker 2:  your friend David Pierce and I'm having one of those days, I assume everybody

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,520
Speaker 2:  has days like this where you wake up at some outrageously early hour

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,080
Speaker 2:  and you look at the clock and you're like, ah, cool, I have five more hours

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,320
Speaker 2:  to sleep. But then something in your brain is just like, no,

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,720
Speaker 2:  we are awake now. Anyway, that's the kind of day I'm having. I've been up

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,520
Speaker 2:  since like two o'clock this morning. I read a bunch of news, I

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,240
Speaker 2:  read a book. I looked at TikTok for a while. I saw every

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,960
Speaker 2:  single thing that has like ever been posted to Reddit in history. I

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,800
Speaker 2:  did all the New York Times games and somehow it's still like first thing

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,520
Speaker 2:  in the morning. It's a very confusing way to start the day 'cause I kind

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,400
Speaker 2:  of feel like it's lunchtime now. Now I'm out just like aimlessly

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,040
Speaker 2:  wandering the neighborhood because I don't know what else to do with myself

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,200
Speaker 2:  because the sun just came up and I've been awake for what feels like a

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,080
Speaker 2:  hundred hours. Anyway, it's gonna be a very confusing day. I'm gonna get

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,280
Speaker 2:  to 2:00 PM and be like, well time for dinner. Time to go to bed. Wish me

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,720
Speaker 2:  luck. Anyway, we have an awesome show coming up for you today we're gonna

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,520
Speaker 2:  talk mostly about the iPhones because it's iPhone season. We have

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,280
Speaker 2:  reviews of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro to talk about. We're also gonna

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,040
Speaker 2:  talk about our reviews of the Apple Watch and the Apple Watch Ultra, but

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,480
Speaker 2:  we're also gonna talk about software stuff. There's obviously new stuff in

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,280
Speaker 2:  iOS 17 interactive widgets and all kinds of cool things going on. But

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,520
Speaker 2:  more broadly, thinking about all this stuff over the last few months has

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,200
Speaker 2:  really led me down this rabbit hole of phone personalization. I think the

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,120
Speaker 2:  work people are willing to do to make their phone feel like

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,000
Speaker 2:  an extension of themselves, whether it's a case or the wallpaper or the

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,920
Speaker 2:  app icons or the look and feel of the whole phone in

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,680
Speaker 2:  general, people are willing to do a lot so that when you turn on the screen

30
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,880
Speaker 2:  it makes you feel something. It makes you feel like you. And I think that's

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,880
Speaker 2:  really cool. So I called up a couple of smart people to talk about how we

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,760
Speaker 2:  do that and how that works and how Apple thinks about that. So we're gonna

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,520
Speaker 2:  dig into that too. All of that is coming up in just a second, but first

34
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,760
Speaker 2:  it is finally time that I can go home and like reasonably make breakfast

35
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,200
Speaker 2:  and have coffee and start the day and also probably take a

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,920
Speaker 2:  several hour nap and see how we do. So I'm gonna go do all of that

37
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,960
Speaker 2:  and then we'll be right back. This is The Vergecast. We'll see you in a sec.

58

00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,790
Speaker 2:  iPhone 1515 plus 15 Pro and 15 Pro

60
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,710
Speaker 2:  Max are all live on The Verge dot com. You should read them all. They're

61
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,510
Speaker 2:  all really great. I don't know if this is the most interesting phone

62
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,470
Speaker 2:  of the year exactly. In fact, it's definitely not the most interesting

63
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,070
Speaker 2:  phone of the year. If you define interesting as just like the one trying

64
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,070
Speaker 2:  to do the most new cool stuff. But it's almost certainly the

65
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,830
Speaker 2:  one the most people are thinking about buying. But should you

66
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,830
Speaker 2:  and which one? Who better to answer that question than the people who reviewed

67
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,550
Speaker 2:  the phones? The Verge is Allison Johnson and Dan Seaford. They're both here.

68
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,510
Speaker 2:  Let's get into it. Allison. Hello. Hello Dan? Hello.

69
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,110
Speaker 5:  Hello.

70
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,070
Speaker 2:  You both have used two of the four phones. You've done

71
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,430
Speaker 2:  big reviews. I have a million like specific questions, but let's

72
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,190
Speaker 2:  just kind of like top line takeaways from your reviews.

73
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,790
Speaker 2:  Like are these phones any good? Yes or no? Who cares?

74
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,750
Speaker 2:  Dan, you go first. iPhone 15 and 15 plus. What's the verdict?

75
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,790
Speaker 5:  Yeah. In a shocking turn of events, apple released a turd of a device. No,

76
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,750
Speaker 5:  I'm kidding. This is the 15th. iPhone like it's, it's like they've been

77
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,310
Speaker 5:  doing this a long time. They know how to make iPhones. Yes, they are good

78
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,310
Speaker 5:  devices. In fact, you could probably say they are great devices and I think

79
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,070
Speaker 5:  that I review the 15 and the 15 plus. I think if people buy them, they're

80
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,310
Speaker 5:  gonna be really happy with them. The type of person that buys this phone

81
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,230
Speaker 5:  typically is coming from a much older iPhone and so

82
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,870
Speaker 5:  they're not coming from an iPhone 14, probably not a 13, so we're talking

83
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,790
Speaker 5:  like a 12 or an 11 or maybe even a 10 Ss. And they are

84
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,750
Speaker 5:  going to get a lot of new features and new experiences plus better

85
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,150
Speaker 5:  camera, better battery life, better performance, better display, all that

86
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,510
Speaker 5:  stuff. So I think it is like a meaningful upgrade for the type of person

87
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,270
Speaker 5:  that is buying this are the 15 and 15 plus all that exciting to

88
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,390
Speaker 5:  us, like enthusiasts and maybe our audience, probably not.

89
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,990
Speaker 5:  Like we've seen all of these things before. They are,

90
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,190
Speaker 5:  I've been calling them a repackaging of the 14 pro. They've got

91
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,070
Speaker 5:  most of the same features as the 14 pro, but not all of the

92
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,070
Speaker 5:  features. Notably they have, they don't have high refresh free screens and

93
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,510
Speaker 5:  they don't have always on displays, which is like two things that I think

94
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,670
Speaker 5:  would make a better experience on these devices. And

95
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,390
Speaker 2:  We're gonna come back to both those, those things.

96
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But like otherwise you get the dynamic island, you get a high

97
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,240
Speaker 5:  resolution camera. Apple's changes to the design this year by just kind of

98
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,600
Speaker 5:  softening the edges and the matte glass and stuff do make them nicer

99
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,080
Speaker 5:  to hold, which you'll never experience 'cause you're gonna put a case on

100
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,960
Speaker 5:  it anyways, but it's there and then they come in

101
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,880
Speaker 5:  five very boring colors.

102
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,520
Speaker 2:  The rage you feel about the colors really like it, it, it's just like it,

103
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,120
Speaker 2:  it fills me up in a lovely way,

104
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,960
Speaker 5:  Don't, I don't get it. Like why bother with colors if you're gonna, if this

105
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,240
Speaker 5:  is what you're gonna do and, and we know apple's done good colors in the

106
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,400
Speaker 5:  past,

107
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,680
Speaker 2:  So yeah, apple is perfectly capable of making cool colors. It just chose

108
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,920
Speaker 2:  not to this year for some reason. Like if you find yourself making a color

109
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,520
Speaker 2:  that you call natural, like you've done it wrong, you've just, you blew it.

110
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,720
Speaker 2:  All right. Allison the pro and pro Max, what's the, what's the kind of top

111
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,440
Speaker 2:  line verdict here?

112
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's kind of along similar lines. I mean they're good

113
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,360
Speaker 6:  in the ways that we are used to pro iPhone

114
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,880
Speaker 6:  being good. I think the new things here this year are

115
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,840
Speaker 6:  like certainly not breakthroughs. And anyone

116
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,920
Speaker 6:  on Android who's hearing me talk about U S B C in like

117
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,800
Speaker 6:  a five times Zoom lens is, you know, like cackling. Yeah,

118
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,240
Speaker 2:  We should just say right up top like Android users. Like we know.

119
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The number of things we're going to say that Android phones have had

120
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,400
Speaker 2:  since like 2004, like we get it. We're we're with you

121
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,600
Speaker 2:  we're on the same page. The SS 23 Ultra is a terrific phone. Yes.

122
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,920
Speaker 2:  Just let Apple people have this one just, just for today. Yeah,

123
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,480
Speaker 6:  Just today

124
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,600
Speaker 2:  Apple people have this like

125
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,560
Speaker 6:  A blanket statement of like I get it. I know. Yeah, yeah.

126
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,200
Speaker 6:  But yeah, it is the first time these things have all come together

127
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,360
Speaker 6:  on an iPhone and I think they're, they're smart in the pro.

128
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,360
Speaker 6:  They're things that, you know, being able to to hook up like

129
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,520
Speaker 6:  an SSD card reader that isn't a special lightning

130
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,800
Speaker 6:  dongle situation is cool. And like I appreciate that

131
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,760
Speaker 6:  someone who is maybe just, just wants a phone, just

132
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,680
Speaker 6:  wants it to work is don't really care so much but it's there. The

133
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,360
Speaker 6:  five times zoom, you know, is, is neat for people who wanna get

134
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,000
Speaker 6:  in there a little more and who are a little more picky about their photography.

135
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,160
Speaker 6:  And the action button is just nice. Like you

136
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,040
Speaker 6:  want a button that does whatever you want on your iPhone, you can have

137
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Speaker 6:  it now like that's super sweet.

138
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,840
Speaker 2:  Okay. I have a bunch of specific things in there I wanna talk about. I think

139
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Speaker 2:  U S B C is a, is a big one and I, I wanna spend a bunch of time talking about

140
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,120
Speaker 2:  that 'cause that surprised me a lot from both of your reviews. But the

141
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,200
Speaker 2:  first thing that jumped out at me that you both said, which I thought was

142
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,720
Speaker 2:  surprising was that the new phones feel

143
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,520
Speaker 2:  different like to hold in your hands than the other ones do.

144
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,000
Speaker 2:  Like I feel like I'm used to Apple saying every year, like we've developed

145
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,240
Speaker 2:  an all new way to make these phones that will change everything. And then

146
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,760
Speaker 2:  you pick it up and it's like, yep, this is still that one. It's an iPhone.

147
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,840
Speaker 2:  But both of you had the experience of kind of picking up the new one and

148
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,720
Speaker 2:  being like, this feels, this feels better. Walk me through

149
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,280
Speaker 2:  that. What, what's actually better about it when you hold it?

150
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,280
Speaker 6:  So I live the life you guys know where I have like 10 phones on my desk at

151
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,120
Speaker 6:  once and I will reach for the 15

152
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,160
Speaker 6:  Pro and pick it up and I just have that moment of like, Ooh, this is

153
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,040
Speaker 6:  a little nicer than I was expecting. Like it's the brushed

154
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,640
Speaker 6:  finish on the sides of the phone. It's, they're a little more rounded

155
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,880
Speaker 6:  the edges so they're, they're just like a tiny bit more comfortable to hold.

156
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,960
Speaker 6:  And really the major thing is on the pro models,

157
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,480
Speaker 6:  especially just being noticeably lighter.

158
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,440
Speaker 6:  Like they're not light phones but if you ever

159
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,280
Speaker 6:  hauled a 14 pro Max then you know the experience of

160
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,840
Speaker 6:  like holding a paper weight in your hand.

161
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's a, it's a big phone.

162
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,400
Speaker 6:  Yeah, this, this feels like holding a normal phone. It doesn't feel like

163
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,240
Speaker 6:  holding a super heavy phone. Okay.

164
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,520
Speaker 2:  And so how much of that is like the, the titanium and all this stuff

165
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,400
Speaker 2:  they talked about in the pro versus just kind of the, the

166
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,040
Speaker 2:  way they've reshaped it? 'cause Dan you had a very similar experience in

167
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,400
Speaker 2:  kind of how the lower end phones feel, right?

168
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. No the, the lower end phones I guess the, the 15 to the 15 plus

169
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,880
Speaker 5:  they're technically the same weights or within very small minute

170
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,800
Speaker 5:  differences of last year's models. But if you're coming from like

171
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,640
Speaker 5:  an iPhone 11 and iPhone 15 is like noticeably

172
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,400
Speaker 5:  lighter, like the order of more than 20 grams which is is absolutely

173
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,080
Speaker 5:  noticeable. I've been, my personal phone's an iPhone 13 pro and that just

174
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,840
Speaker 5:  feels like a lead weight to me. The 15 plus which has a much larger

175
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,360
Speaker 5:  screen is actually technically lighter than my 13 pro.

176
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,800
Speaker 5:  And so you know, you you may say like oh 10 20 grams here,

177
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,320
Speaker 5:  it doesn't really matter. Like when you're holding these things all day long

178
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,120
Speaker 5:  and you're putting 'em in and in your pocket or whatever, like I feel every

179
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,600
Speaker 5:  single gram that gets added and it's like my biggest complaint with the iPhone

180
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,000
Speaker 5:  for the past few years, the pro models at least is how heavy they've become

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,760
Speaker 5:  because Apple is stuck with the stainless steel frame and the

182
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,520
Speaker 5:  polished and the premium, all that jazz. So I'm really excited that the

183
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,600
Speaker 5:  pro models move to titanium but I also appreciate that the

184
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,960
Speaker 5:  standard model also benefits from the softer edges on the frame

185
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,520
Speaker 5:  so that it doesn't cut into your pinky or your your palm as much when you're

186
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,360
Speaker 5:  holding it. The back glass is now a frosted or matte finish

187
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,440
Speaker 5:  which is like nicer to hold. I think that makes it a little bit more slippery.

188
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Speaker 5:  Anyone who's owned a pro foam for the past few years kind of knows what that

189
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,960
Speaker 5:  back glass feels like. It's a kind of a slippery experience. Again, most

190
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,040
Speaker 5:  people are gonna put cases on these and all kind of doesn't matter, but they

191
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,440
Speaker 5:  just feel like nicer objects and that's like befitting of what the prices

192
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,240
Speaker 5:  are because really even the less expensive phones are starting at

193
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,920
Speaker 5:  $800 and at this point like that is like purely in premium phone

194
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,960
Speaker 5:  territory. You can get really like advanced devices for this much.

195
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,640
Speaker 5:  I mean if you find a good deal you'll find a flip phone from Samsung for

196
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,440
Speaker 5:  that much money. So like, you know, you have to like kind of justify

197
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,280
Speaker 5:  what the cost is that you're paying for and there's a lot of reasons for

198
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,400
Speaker 5:  it. But you know, part of it is the experience of the tactile device and,

199
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,270
Speaker 5:  and I think that these are very well made, it's very obvious that Apple's

200
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,320
Speaker 5:  been making iPhones for a very long time and they've continued to like kind

201
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,520
Speaker 5:  of iterate and polish them to, to make them a nicer experience.

202
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,920
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah that makes sense. Allison, this one's just for you and then we're

203
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Speaker 2:  gonna go back to things Dan's allowed to talk about Action button. What did

204
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,800
Speaker 2:  you do? Well I don't care about anything else about the iPhone 15. I care

205
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,240
Speaker 2:  so much about the action button

206
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,920
Speaker 6:  Button. There's a new button I, so I put it to

207
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,960
Speaker 6:  open the camera, which I thought I would really like. 'cause I, I struggle

208
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,440
Speaker 6:  with a swiping on the screen to open. I don't know why

209
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,160
Speaker 2:  The number of people I have heard say that in the last seven days is so fascinating.

210
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah I feel like there are a hundred thousand ways to open the camera

211
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,600
Speaker 2:  iOS like another button to do it is the last thing I need. oh my gosh. But

212
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,360
Speaker 2:  it seems like so many people ha struggle with that same thing

213
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
Speaker 2:  you're describing. It's really interesting.

214
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,360
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's always when someone else is looking at me using the phone too,

215
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,160
Speaker 2:  They're like, take this picture and you're like, ah,

216
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,960
Speaker 6:  I don't know, I'm sorry. Yeah, so I I,

217
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Speaker 6:  that's like the first thing I did. I was super excited about it but then

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,920
Speaker 6:  I noticed I just wasn't really using it for that. I think it's just

219
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,600
Speaker 6:  like I used the pro Max a little more and I think having it just like, like

220
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,240
Speaker 6:  it's that much taller and the action button is that much farther away. It

221
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,080
Speaker 6:  just felt like a pain to it just like kind of awkward to be like

222
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,040
Speaker 6:  reaching around the back of the phone to you know, push the button. But

223
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,360
Speaker 6:  so I have other ideas for it, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do the shortcuts like

224
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,280
Speaker 6:  y'all think I'm kidding about making it order me a pumpkin spice latte.

225
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,960
Speaker 6:  But I am a hundred percent doing that. Yeah, I'm back in my

226
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,240
Speaker 6:  back of my natural environment so I can go wild with it

227
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,480
Speaker 6:  now.

228
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,040
Speaker 2:  I love that. Dan you're not allowed to answer 'cause you reviewed the loser

229
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,920
Speaker 2:  phones. I'm just kidding. Someday when you're allowed to have an action button

230
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,640
Speaker 2:  many years from now, what are you gonna do with it?

231
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,120
Speaker 5:  I hate to be really boring but I, I think I would probably use it for the

232
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,400
Speaker 5:  ringer switch maybe. But like I was thinking yesterday,

233
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,120
Speaker 5:  there's a feature on Android that I really like that if you flip the phone

234
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,720
Speaker 5:  face down it turns into do not disturb mode. And there isn't a way to do

235
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,640
Speaker 5:  that on the iPhone, but I could set the action button to do not disturb.

236
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,520
Speaker 5:  So like I could just like hold it for a second put in do not disturb face

237
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,440
Speaker 5:  down. It's more than like I want, do I wanna just flip it over and have it

238
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,800
Speaker 5:  down? So I don't know, that's like my first initial idea. I, you know, Allison

239
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,280
Speaker 5:  mentioned we the camera, I think that what a lot of

240
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,080
Speaker 5:  enthusiasts will do is set it up to open third party camera apps, which

241
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,880
Speaker 5:  right now is a pain no matter which way you do it on the

242
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Speaker 5:  iPhone, whether it's for the lock screen or control center or whatever, opening

243
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,560
Speaker 5:  a third party camera app is kind of annoying. I think maybe you could set

244
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,960
Speaker 5:  a widget on the lock screen now to do it, which is a workaround. But

245
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,760
Speaker 5:  I've already seen the developers of Haylight are like adding a toggle in

246
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,400
Speaker 5:  their app to like let you do it from the action button. And so I'm sure a

247
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,120
Speaker 5:  lot of people are gonna do that.

248
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,280
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's a good one. It's funny you mentioned Do Not Disturb because

249
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,520
Speaker 2:  that was, that was my thought too. Like somebody sent me a thing the other

250
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,480
Speaker 2:  day where they had built a shortcut where whenever they plug their phone

251
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,280
Speaker 2:  in, if it's after 10:00 PM it automatically switches it to sleep mode.

252
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,200
Speaker 2:  And I was like, that's genius. But then this came out and I was just like,

253
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,800
Speaker 2:  oh it's the same thing. Like I, I can just punch on Do not disturb, which

254
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,160
Speaker 2:  is the kind of thing that I'd like to like do often when I even just wanna

255
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,800
Speaker 2:  pay attention for a few minutes or whatever. And having a button that can

256
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,360
Speaker 2:  do it seems very nice. I'm very into that but okay, that's enough of that.

257
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,920
Speaker 2:  I could also talk to you about interactive widgets for several hours, but

258
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,600
Speaker 2:  we'll do that on another podcast. Let's talk about U U S P C because

259
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,240
Speaker 2:  the thing that I think a bunch of us have discovered over the last

260
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,960
Speaker 2:  eight days since this iPhone launched is that Apple

261
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,760
Speaker 2:  made a much more open port than any of us expected.

262
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,480
Speaker 2:  And I'm just assuming, knowing the two of you that you've spent a lot of

263
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,080
Speaker 2:  time over the last week plugging random things into the iPhone to see what

264
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,840
Speaker 2:  would happen. Allison what, what have you been plugging into the iPhone and

265
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,440
Speaker 2:  what has happened?

266
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,720
Speaker 6:  Well, when we were shooting the video, you know, we had access to like

267
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,640
Speaker 6:  an ethernet cable and SD card and all this stuff

268
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,800
Speaker 6:  and yeah, it, it truly is like kind of mind blowing that you

269
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,640
Speaker 6:  plug it in and it, it doesn't, it doesn't complain, it doesn't,

270
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,040
Speaker 6:  you know, make you jump through a bunch of hoops. Like it just does

271
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,120
Speaker 6:  whatever you're trying to do. And like we plugged in that ethernet cable

272
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,080
Speaker 6:  and turned off the wifi and the cell data and

273
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,000
Speaker 6:  it just had internet. It just had internet from a cable. It was like

274
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,000
Speaker 6:  who, who saw that coming? What

275
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,880
Speaker 2:  A world I

276
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,040
Speaker 6:  Know.

277
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:16,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think we've been so conditioned for like, especially with the iPhone

278
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,640
Speaker 5:  for Apple to get in the way of what we want to do with it. That it's, it

279
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,240
Speaker 5:  is like, it's a si it's, it feels a little silly to say that like I plugged

280
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,680
Speaker 5:  in an ethernet cable and it worked or like I plugged in an SD card and I

281
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,400
Speaker 5:  could see the files on it. Like, but we are just so conditioned

282
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,080
Speaker 5:  to the iPhone's kind of like guard walled garden

283
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,760
Speaker 5:  experience where you wouldn't think that you can normally do these things

284
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,680
Speaker 5:  and in the past they required special hardware adapters and even

285
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,520
Speaker 5:  then it was still limited. So like it was kind of fun to just

286
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,120
Speaker 5:  jam something into the U S B port, watch what happens and then be like, oh

287
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,720
Speaker 5:  that's the thing you would've expected to happen. And like I don't know how

288
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,200
Speaker 5:  often you're going to use ethernet on your iPhone, probably never, but

289
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,960
Speaker 5:  photographers might use SD card, videographers can shoot directly to an SS

290
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,600
Speaker 5:  S S D, stuff like that. Like all those things just kind of work. It's almost

291
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,480
Speaker 5:  like it's a computer.

292
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,680
Speaker 2:  Yeah. What a crazy idea. It does seem like storage is

293
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,560
Speaker 2:  probably the most likely real use case for people. Right.

294
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,640
Speaker 2:  In part because it's a way to like get stuff off of your phone in a way that

295
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,000
Speaker 2:  is not always easy. But also because like I, I

296
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,040
Speaker 2:  feel like a thing I have surprisingly often is I have something on a hard

297
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,320
Speaker 2:  drive or somewhere else that I would like to be on my phone so that I can

298
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,440
Speaker 2:  do something with and you can just plug in external storage and it just opens

299
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,320
Speaker 2:  up in the files app. Right? Like that's pretty meaningful and new and

300
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,800
Speaker 2:  it's nuts that I'm saying that like it's an exciting new feature but, but

301
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,880
Speaker 2:  like here we are. Yeah. Are there, are there other things that you feel like

302
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,680
Speaker 2:  rise to that level of like things people might actually

303
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,840
Speaker 2:  use this port for other than charging?

304
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,640
Speaker 5:  I think that some people might wanna use use it for video out You can, yeah

305
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,480
Speaker 5:  you can plug a U S B C cable to H D M I or to display port. It supports

306
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,400
Speaker 5:  display port out at four K 60 resolution. So if you want

307
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,240
Speaker 5:  to plug the phone into a TV and watch a video

308
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,000
Speaker 5:  on the tv, you get, you get screen mirroring basically. But the, the, if

309
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,040
Speaker 5:  you're watching a video you can make the video go whole scr full screen.

310
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,720
Speaker 5:  That might be a a use case for some folks. But again, yeah, I think you're

311
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,720
Speaker 5:  probably right in that it is either U S B hubs that allow you

312
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,000
Speaker 5:  to plug in like U S B A accessories or storage

313
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,320
Speaker 5:  are really going to be the main type of accessories outside of

314
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,840
Speaker 5:  charging that you would use the U S B C port for.

315
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I just, I just wanna say Allison, kudos for getting the sentence Dex

316
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,720
Speaker 2:  remains undefeated into the 15 pro review because you

317
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,480
Speaker 2:  Thank you. You would think you could plug it into something and you might

318
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,320
Speaker 2:  get a full blown, you know, desktop environment on a screen. But

319
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,040
Speaker 2:  we, we got a little, we got a little Dex win in the 15 pro review and that

320
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,600
Speaker 2:  made me very happy

321
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,520
Speaker 6:  And and they're so intense about like how good this

322
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,480
Speaker 6:  processor is that you would think like, okay so let me do

323
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,160
Speaker 6:  something with it. No, you can play resonant Evo.

324
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,200
Speaker 2:  I will not lie. I have had the thought that stage manager

325
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,480
Speaker 2:  feels like something that might appear when you plug your

326
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,160
Speaker 2:  iPhone into a larger display sometime in the near future. I don't think

327
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,880
Speaker 5:  It's ever gonna happen.

328
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,640
Speaker 2:  I will do that once if that exists. And then never, ever, ever again

329
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,960
Speaker 2:  because it's stage manager. Okay, so the, the other thing we should talk

330
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,840
Speaker 2:  about is the cameras and I think especially on the pro Allison and

331
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,680
Speaker 2:  there are a bunch of new things, there's a bunch of new like

332
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,600
Speaker 2:  underlying tech, but in terms of like features for people, there's the new

333
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,400
Speaker 2:  telephoto lens, the which is five x zoom, which I think is a big deal. There

334
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,920
Speaker 2:  are the new focal lengths on the default camera, which you can move around

335
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,520
Speaker 2:  and pick between. It shoots 24 megapixels by default. Now

336
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,800
Speaker 2:  am I missing anything? Like have those jumped out to you as like really making

337
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,600
Speaker 2:  a difference in how you use your phone's camera every day?

338
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,360
Speaker 6:  Yeah, they're all things that I'm really appreciating and

339
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,440
Speaker 6:  having that, you know, you could always like pinch and zoom a little bit

340
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,320
Speaker 6:  if you feel like the standard camera lens is too wide.

341
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,800
Speaker 6:  But there's something different about, especially having those little like

342
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,200
Speaker 6:  millimeter focal length equivalents in there. It just kind of warms your

343
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,480
Speaker 6:  heart and makes you feel like, oh I'm take, I'm doing photography,

344
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,560
Speaker 2:  I'm real photography.

345
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah I'm taking a picture at 35 millimeters, not

346
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,240
Speaker 6:  1.5 x. It like switches back to 1.5 x.

347
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,320
Speaker 2:  As soon as you do it, you get to be the person who says, I make photos, I

348
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,400
Speaker 2:  don't take photos. Yeah. That's like, that's, that's what happens. Yeah,

349
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,440
Speaker 6:  I've been saying that all week and everyone's so tired of me, I'm

350
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,360
Speaker 6:  like, shh, I'm making photographs. Yeah, no I,

351
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:34,520
Speaker 6:  I've like just very eagerly like incorporated them

352
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,480
Speaker 6:  into how I think about taking pictures with an iPhone and it's great.

353
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,600
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm happy with, you know, all the flexibility we get this year.

354
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Dan you, I remember when it first launched were very excited about

355
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,880
Speaker 2:  the idea of the, of the 24 megapixel default photos. Yeah.

356
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,520
Speaker 2:  My worry was file size, right? And there's always the thing where it's like,

357
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,680
Speaker 2:  it depends on where you put it, how much resolution you actually need and

358
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,600
Speaker 2:  on and on. And we can debate that forever, but how good

359
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,080
Speaker 2:  a photo do you want versus how many can you store on your phone is kind of

360
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,120
Speaker 2:  a forever question. Like did Apple find the right middle there?

361
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think with the 24 it's not as big of

362
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,440
Speaker 5:  a file size compromise as, as some people might have expected if you're

363
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,080
Speaker 5:  using the default heath mode, which I'm gonna say heath,

364
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,040
Speaker 2:  Which either is or is not pronounced heath but we'll leave it alone for this

365
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:20,520
Speaker 2:  heath

366
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,760
Speaker 5:  I noticed that it's about like, you know, if a jpeg is

367
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,640
Speaker 5:  or or if a 12 megapixel image is two megabytes, A 24 is about three

368
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,240
Speaker 5:  that can vary some, you know, photos if they've got more detail

369
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,120
Speaker 5:  in them and stuff like that can be larger and so then the 24 megapixel will

370
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,720
Speaker 5:  be larger but when you go to 48 megapixel it's double the 24.

371
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,920
Speaker 5:  So that is like a significant difference and that will eat up your storage

372
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,640
Speaker 5:  and I don't think you actually gain much in terms of detail with the side-by-side

373
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,960
Speaker 5:  comparisons I did between the 24 and the full size 48,

374
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,800
Speaker 5:  you're not getting a lot there in terms of extra detail because these are

375
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,680
Speaker 5:  such small sensors. But with 24 megapixels you're moving past the

376
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,640
Speaker 5:  12 which we had been at since the iPhone success and you are getting a

377
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,440
Speaker 5:  little bit more room to crop, maybe a little bit more room to digital Zoom

378
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,320
Speaker 5:  as Allison mentioned and a little bit more flexibility. But ultimately,

379
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,680
Speaker 5:  you know, apple likes to talk about how oh you could blow it up to a 20 inch

380
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,280
Speaker 5:  by 30 inch poster and do all this stuff and it's like, yeah no you're not

381
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,520
Speaker 5:  gonna do that. It's a phone photo, it's still gonna look like it comes from

382
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,200
Speaker 5:  a phone but it gives you a little bit more cropping ability

383
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,760
Speaker 5:  after the fact without really compromising storage that much.

384
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,720
Speaker 5:  These phones all started 128 gigabytes now, which is not a

385
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,920
Speaker 5:  terrible starting point especially if you're coming from an older one that

386
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,000
Speaker 5:  had 64 gigs or getting twice as much storage so you got more room for the

387
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,920
Speaker 5:  photos and Apple would love to sell you iCloud plus storage, which it will

388
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,640
Speaker 5:  do up to 12 terabytes a month now. It

389
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,440
Speaker 2:  Would love, it would, I mean it would love to like, like so much it would

390
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,360
Speaker 2:  make Tim Cook personally thrilled to sell you 12 terabytes of iCloud

391
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,120
Speaker 2:  storage. Allison, you and I are both long term

392
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,800
Speaker 2:  anti digital Zoom zealots. I would say, I

393
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,720
Speaker 2:  believe it is criminal to just stand there and pinch and zoom on the

394
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,640
Speaker 2:  screen to make your photos worse. But you in the process of reviewing

395
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,240
Speaker 2:  the 15 Pro and Promax seem to have found some kind of zen

396
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,440
Speaker 2:  with the way that Apple is approaching this. Can you, can you explain this

397
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,520
Speaker 2:  to me? How did you, why does it feel like this works for you?

398
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,480
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I, I think part of it is in my head when you're,

399
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:23,360
Speaker 6:  when you're going to like a specific focal length and Apple

400
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,120
Speaker 6:  is doing a little bit extra in the background with the

401
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,960
Speaker 6:  processing, you know it's not just, it's not just upraising the

402
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:35,120
Speaker 6:  image and calling it a day. There's

403
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,200
Speaker 6:  a fair amount going on with like deep fusion and then incorporating

404
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,320
Speaker 6:  some detail from a higher resolution frame, which is

405
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,040
Speaker 6:  either the 48 or 24 megapixel if you're in the

406
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,920
Speaker 6:  35 millimeter crop, how much of that makes a big

407
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,800
Speaker 6:  difference? I don't know, but it makes me feel better.

408
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,360
Speaker 6:  I feel like at ease with the picture that I'm taking and

409
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,720
Speaker 6:  I think that's something that we're all gonna have to get more comfy with

410
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,920
Speaker 6:  going forward because even walking, you know, comparing it with the

411
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,280
Speaker 6:  Samsung S 23 Ultra which has that 10 x lens,

412
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,520
Speaker 6:  you know, I'm going to five x to compare it to the

413
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,680
Speaker 6:  iPhone and that's not a native focal length that it has,

414
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,040
Speaker 6:  it's still looks better than the iPhone image,

415
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,040
Speaker 6:  which is funny. So it just kind of changes how you have to think about like,

416
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,400
Speaker 6:  like letting the, trusting the camera a little more and not

417
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,600
Speaker 6:  being quite so picky about focal length.

418
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,640
Speaker 2:  It is a weird thing. I mean all of the process now is digital, like

419
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,200
Speaker 2:  every step of the way computers are doing computer

420
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,040
Speaker 2:  things. So I think I'm, I'm also slowly learning to let go of the

421
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,960
Speaker 2:  idea that if I do it at one x it is capturing a photo as

422
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,400
Speaker 2:  photos were meant to be captured and everything else is like some

423
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Speaker 2:  computery lie, like it's all kind of a computery lie. Yeah. At this point,

424
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Speaker 2:  right? Yeah it's

425
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,480
Speaker 6:  An illusion. We we've,

426
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,120
Speaker 5:  We've heard this from, I know Google when it introduced

427
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,320
Speaker 5:  its super res zoom feature it, it kind of said similar things that

428
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,080
Speaker 5:  like if you were to use super res zoom before you take the photo,

429
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,280
Speaker 5:  you will get a better image than if you just took the photo at the wide angle

430
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,040
Speaker 5:  and digitally cropped it afterwards because they're, they're taking input

431
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,680
Speaker 5:  from multiple frames and averaging them together and things like that. Whereas

432
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,120
Speaker 5:  if you crop later it is just a single frame that you have to work with and

433
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,080
Speaker 5:  Apple's doing a very similar type of thing here where it is averaging multiple

434
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,560
Speaker 5:  frames, stacking them together. That's what D Fusion has been doing for a

435
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,440
Speaker 5:  few years now. I think Allison, they're on like generation three or five

436
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,960
Speaker 5:  of D Fusion, something like that and then now they have the larger sensor

437
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,880
Speaker 5:  that they can also pair higher resolution data from for detail. So I know

438
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,640
Speaker 5:  that like when I go get an iPhone 15 pro and start using it, I'm gonna

439
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,640
Speaker 5:  lock it on 35 millimeter and never look back.

440
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,360
Speaker 2:  That was actually gonna be my next question is like what's the right default

441
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,600
Speaker 2:  setup here? 'cause the other part

442
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,960
Speaker 5:  Is 35 millimeter is the only correct focal

443
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,600
Speaker 2:  Light. Okay. So, we, we shoot 24 megapixel heath images,

444
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,080
Speaker 2:  35 millimeter camera victory forever

445
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,120
Speaker 6:  ProRes log video.

446
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,920
Speaker 2:  You can fit four photos on your phone and it's all over.

447
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,120
Speaker 5:  If you want to be the cool street photographer, you shoot a 35 millimeter.

448
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:12,640
Speaker 5:  There

449
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:12,800
Speaker 2:  We go.

450
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,240
Speaker 6:  That's true. That is proven. Yeah.

451
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,200
Speaker 2:  Asked and answered. Alright, so let's, let's do some like straightforward

452
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,920
Speaker 2:  buying advice here. So Dan, last year it seems very clear

453
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,560
Speaker 2:  that the people who wanted a 14 picked a 14 over a

454
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,520
Speaker 2:  14 plus. Is there any reason to believe that's not gonna be the case again

455
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,640
Speaker 2:  of the like entry phones? Do we think the 14 is probably

456
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,280
Speaker 2:  the one for most people, the 15 Jesus Christ.

457
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,480
Speaker 5:  So I, you know, I think last year with the 14 and the 14 plus, it was kind

458
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,240
Speaker 5:  of a weird scenario. One the 14 plus didn't come out for quite a few months

459
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,880
Speaker 5:  afterwards so it, it didn't, wasn't the variable at the same time. That's

460
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,760
Speaker 5:  true. And then the 14 plus was like if you want a big screen and a

461
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,920
Speaker 5:  big battery and, and Allison's review last year, like she made the point

462
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,560
Speaker 5:  like this delivers on both of those things but it was doing it at $900

463
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,320
Speaker 5:  and if you wanted a 14 pro Max it was only 200 bucks more

464
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,720
Speaker 5:  this year. The not only is the 15 to 15 plus available

465
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,240
Speaker 5:  at the same time, so you will be able to take advantage of all the same carrier

466
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,760
Speaker 5:  promotions or whatever you'll be in the store. You'll look at it, it's like

467
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,240
Speaker 5:  oh wow, this one actually is bigger but it's also, it's still

468
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,120
Speaker 5:  $900. But the bigger pro phone, the pro Max has

469
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,280
Speaker 5:  gone up in starting price a hundred dollars so now there's a

470
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,680
Speaker 5:  $300 jump And I think that starts to make it like,

471
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,640
Speaker 5:  do I really need to go that much if I just want a big screen and a big battery?

472
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,640
Speaker 5:  And I, I think that people will be making that calculus more and and maybe

473
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Speaker 5:  it'll do better for the plus model. I, I could tell you that the plus model

474
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,960
Speaker 5:  this year absolutely delivers on battery life. I had a horrific travel

475
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,720
Speaker 5:  day coming back from WW D c I was staring at the 15 plus

476
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,840
Speaker 5:  all day long. I had like something like eight, nine hours of screen time

477
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,760
Speaker 5:  and I got home at like 11 or 12 and midnight

478
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,480
Speaker 5:  and I still had like 35% battery left flat on it. It was like that's pretty

479
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,280
Speaker 5:  good. Like this thing just goes. And so for a lot of people big screen, big

480
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,120
Speaker 5:  battery is exactly what they want and 15 plus delivers. I think if you are

481
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,320
Speaker 5:  coming from a mini, which if you have a 12 mini, maybe you're getting

482
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,160
Speaker 5:  around time, they're like needing a new phone, the iPhone 15 is obviously

483
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,880
Speaker 5:  gonna be much more attractive to you. It's smaller, it's lighter, it fits

484
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,280
Speaker 5:  in your hand easier. It's stuff like that. I think that is really the only

485
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,040
Speaker 5:  practical option for anyone who wants a small iPhone at this point. And then

486
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,960
Speaker 5:  the last point of consideration is as usual, apple is selling last

487
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,520
Speaker 5:  year's 14 and 14 plus for a hundred dollars less than the 15 and 15 plus

488
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,440
Speaker 5:  this year. I think that this year the things you

489
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,800
Speaker 5:  get for the a hundred dollars more make it worthwhile to get the 15. Last

490
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,200
Speaker 5:  year we had the opposite conclusion, the 14 was not that much better than

491
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,720
Speaker 5:  the 13 and you can still buy the 13 for a hundred bucks less go save your

492
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,320
Speaker 5:  money. But this year you get U S B C, which is more convenient,

493
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,920
Speaker 5:  flexible way to charge, you get the dynamic island which is you know, a

494
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,240
Speaker 5:  more pleasant, fun user interface and it's going to continue to get more

495
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,000
Speaker 5:  utilized as we go forward. And you do get meaningful improvements on the

496
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,160
Speaker 5:  camera. We didn't really talk too much about it, but I think that the automatic

497
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,360
Speaker 5:  portrait mode is a thing that people will actually really

498
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:10,080
Speaker 5:  like and use and get a lot of value out of. Especially the average

499
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,920
Speaker 5:  custom consumer buying the iPhone 15 or 15 plus. So all of those things add

500
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,160
Speaker 5:  up. I think they make it worthwhile to buy the 15 over the 14 this year.

501
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,440
Speaker 5:  But if you have a 14, there's no reason to upgrade. There's need, there's

502
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,880
Speaker 5:  probably not much of a reason to upgrade. But if you are on a 12 or 11 or

503
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,200
Speaker 5:  older then I think you, you get a lot here this year. The

504
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,080
Speaker 2:  Portrait mode thing is a good one. I knew there was something in the cool

505
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,880
Speaker 2:  things in the camera list I was forgetting and that's one that's a big deal.

506
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,280
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

507
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,560
Speaker 5:  I I I think that like, you know, I observe my spouse taking pictures of our

508
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,960
Speaker 5:  kids all the time and she never switches to portrait mode or anything like

509
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,760
Speaker 5:  that that she just snaps with the default camera and now if she had an

510
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,600
Speaker 5:  iPhone 15 or a 15 Pro, she can just do that and then

511
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,520
Speaker 5:  after the fact I can go in the photo set and be like, oh portrait mode cool

512
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,680
Speaker 5:  and I can play with it and whatever and make it pop more. And I think that

513
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,440
Speaker 5:  there's probably a lot of people who a, never realize that they could

514
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,760
Speaker 5:  switch to portrait mode because it was a entirely different setting or B

515
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,320
Speaker 5:  didn't remember how or didn't remember to do it in the moment when they're

516
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,760
Speaker 5:  trying to capture the image which is happening quickly in front of them

517
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Speaker 2:  Because like Allison, they couldn't figure out how to get the button to work.

518
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,960
Speaker 6:  Yeah, just stuck on that home screen, on the lock screen. Yeah.

519
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:15,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

520
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,760
Speaker 2:  Okay. And then Allison for you the, the pro versus the pro Max

521
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,320
Speaker 2:  again screen and battery differences, am I right in thinking that the

522
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,480
Speaker 2:  five x telephoto zoom is only on the pro Max?

523
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,320
Speaker 6:  That's right.

524
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,320
Speaker 2:  Okay, so that's a big difference too. Like what, how would you rank between

525
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,440
Speaker 2:  the two? Like how, how should people choose which one to buy?

526
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:38,800
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it kind of throws all my usual like buying a

527
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,600
Speaker 6:  new phone thinking out the window because I, I think there, you know there

528
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,480
Speaker 6:  is kind of a different customer for the pro and the pro Max and

529
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,560
Speaker 6:  whether whether or not your current phone is working well is like

530
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,080
Speaker 6:  less part of the equation. But I think

531
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,560
Speaker 6:  yeah the five times Zoom is nice. I, I get why it's only

532
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,240
Speaker 6:  on the bigger phone. Google only puts it on its bigger phone,

533
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,560
Speaker 6:  it's something I would consider going up to the bigger phone for,

534
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,480
Speaker 6:  especially since it's a little bit lighter weight this year and it doesn't

535
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,320
Speaker 6:  feel like such a burden carrying it around. But

536
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,160
Speaker 6:  there's a lot to consider and I think some people are just gonna jump on,

537
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,360
Speaker 6:  you know, the new pro iPhone and I think like as silly as

538
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,560
Speaker 6:  the word pro is and kind of meaningless now,

539
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,200
Speaker 6:  I think there is a a certain kind of person who like if, if your phone

540
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,280
Speaker 6:  is kind of a big part of like how you work

541
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,160
Speaker 6:  when you travel and you've got chargers for other things or if you,

542
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,880
Speaker 6:  if you're a video creator and you can see

543
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,000
Speaker 6:  yourself really, you know, using it more in your workflow, I think

544
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,600
Speaker 6:  it does make sense for a, I don't think pros are the

545
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,040
Speaker 6:  word I would use but it makes sense for a certain kind of person.

546
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's like the iPhone 15 videographer. Yeah it's like

547
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,760
Speaker 2:  if you, if you shoot a lot of big files you're the, this might work

548
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,680
Speaker 2:  extras pretty good. I like that. Yeah,

549
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,760
Speaker 5:  We kind of like have these discussions every year like who is a person to

550
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,480
Speaker 5:  buy a pro over a standard iPhone and like ultimately

551
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,040
Speaker 5:  at the end of the day Apple sells a ton of pro phones. I think the reports

552
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,640
Speaker 5:  from the 14 generation was like the iPhone 14 was like

553
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,360
Speaker 5:  single digit percentage more than the iPhone 14 pro in terms of like numbers

554
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,800
Speaker 5:  of people that bought it. So like people will buy the more expensive phone

555
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,400
Speaker 5:  I think 'cause it's more expensive but also because it's nicer. I think a

556
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,160
Speaker 5:  lot of people see the three lenses on the back where they're just three X

557
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,800
Speaker 5:  or five x and they see that like hey this does more and and their

558
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,720
Speaker 5:  carrier's willing to subsidize half the price anyways. So you know,

559
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,720
Speaker 5:  I think we'll see a lot of people buying the pro models this year and then

560
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,800
Speaker 5:  the 15 and the 15 plus will be, you know, a much

561
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,680
Speaker 5:  slower ramp up in terms of like interest in buying and people will buy them

562
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,040
Speaker 5:  as their old phones break, but like the early adopter, the person who's upgrading

563
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,080
Speaker 5:  every single year, they're, they're gonna gravitate to the pro always. It's

564
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,200
Speaker 5:  the exciting one. That's what I wrote in my review is like the regular 15

565
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,840
Speaker 5:  is never going to be exciting. It's never going to be like the platform for

566
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,440
Speaker 5:  new ideas or technologies. The pro is always going to be that. So if you

567
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,240
Speaker 5:  want that, if you wanna experience that, you're always gonna go with the

568
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,400
Speaker 5:  pro.

569
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:14,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I, I totally agree. I think that's right. Alright, I'm gonna let you

570
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Speaker 2:  guys go here in a minute but before I do, will you guys hang out and do a

571
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,360
Speaker 2:  hotline question with me really fast? Yeah, just I think you're the right

572
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,000
Speaker 2:  two people to help me answer this question. As a reminder, the hotline number

573
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,920
Speaker 2:  is 8 6 6 Verge one one call. Ask us all your tech questions and

574
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,440
Speaker 2:  you can email Vergecast at The Verge dot com if you don't wanna call. But

575
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,720
Speaker 2:  frankly it's super fun when you call, it's nice to hear your voices. Okay,

576
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,680
Speaker 2:  let's hear Dan, I have been pestering you about this all day so I expect

577
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,440
Speaker 2:  good things from you but here we go. Let me just play the question we have

578
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,120
Speaker 2:  for you right now.

579
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,400
Speaker 7:  Hey there guys, my name is Jordan. I had a question about the new

580
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,840
Speaker 7:  iPhone fifteens specifically how you could

581
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,720
Speaker 7:  charge other iPhones by plugging in A U S B C cable.

582
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,400
Speaker 7:  I know that if you do a U SS B C to lightning it will always charge

583
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,400
Speaker 7:  the lightning phone and if you the iPhone it will kind of

584
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,200
Speaker 7:  do like a handshake action and charge the lesser charge

585
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:12,040
Speaker 7:  of the two. My question is, you know, it'll, it'll do like a

586
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,800
Speaker 7:  51% versus 50% and then the 51% will start charging

587
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,440
Speaker 7:  that one or whatever. But what if you take like an iPhone plus

588
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,800
Speaker 7:  and you plug in say U S B C cable to another like standard

589
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,880
Speaker 7:  iPhone 15 and they're both at like, you know, let's say the the iPhone plus

590
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,200
Speaker 7:  is at like 45% whereas the other one is at like

591
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,920
Speaker 7:  50%, right? So like the plus technically has less battery

592
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,800
Speaker 7:  percentage but it has a bigger battery. What

593
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,360
Speaker 7:  happens? Who wins that exchange? Does the plus charge because it

594
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,320
Speaker 7:  technically has more battery with which to charge or

595
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,440
Speaker 7:  does the phone with the higher percentage win every time?

596
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,720
Speaker 7:  Thanks and love the show.

597
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,970
Speaker 2:  Okay, so this is maybe the most Verge casty hotline question we have ever

598
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,530
Speaker 2:  received. I was gonna say I love it so much. I have

599
00:34:59,530 --> 00:34:59,890
Speaker 5:  An answer

600
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:04,050
Speaker 2:  Dan, I have been making you plug things into other things all day. I've been

601
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:04,250
Speaker 2:  also

602
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,370
Speaker 5:  Running down batteries to try and get the levels right or whatever.

603
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,410
Speaker 2:  So tell me what you know so far. So

604
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,330
Speaker 5:  What I know so far is he's correct that if you plug in

605
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,410
Speaker 5:  a lightning iPhone to A U SS B C iPhone, the U S B C

606
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,610
Speaker 5:  one will always send power to the lightning iPhone. The lightning does not

607
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,330
Speaker 5:  work the other direction.

608
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,810
Speaker 2:  And also AirPods and watches, which is like the thing it's ostensibly meant

609
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,850
Speaker 2:  for is to charge your small devices. Yeah

610
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,890
Speaker 5:  Air POS and watches it will charge those devices. They will not reverse charge

611
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,170
Speaker 5:  the phone. But right now I've got the iPhone 15 plus which is at

612
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:38,120
Speaker 5:  75% battery and I've got the iPhone 15, which is

613
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,120
Speaker 5:  a 96% battery and I plug them in together with my u S BBC cable

614
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,080
Speaker 5:  and the iPhone 15 is charging the 15 plus.

615
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,240
Speaker 5:  Whoa. So the theory is which everyone has the lowest

616
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,600
Speaker 5:  amount of battery percentage on its meter, even if the real life capacity

617
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,480
Speaker 5:  is still more than the 15 seems to be the way that the power

618
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,200
Speaker 5:  goes. U S B C is kind of weird. You can kind of like sometimes

619
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,040
Speaker 5:  unplug them and replug them and it will do its handshake again

620
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,240
Speaker 5:  and like switch rolls with other U S B C devices. But with the iPhones at

621
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,800
Speaker 5:  least it seems to be consistently happening that the one with the larger

622
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,840
Speaker 5:  battery percentage charges the one with a lower battery percentage. So

623
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,720
Speaker 5:  if you want it to be a real mensch with your iPhone 15 and you've got

624
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,400
Speaker 5:  a buddy who's got an iPhone 15 plus or pro Max or whatever and

625
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,200
Speaker 5:  and, and you wanna give them your battery and and and give them some juice

626
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,920
Speaker 5:  and they will just suck all the life out of your phone No

627
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,720
Speaker 5:  to power up their big battery cells. You can do that. But it does do this

628
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,400
Speaker 5:  at a pretty slow wattage. It's 4.5 watch, which is slower than

629
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,480
Speaker 5:  slow wireless charging. So you're not gonna be charging all that quickly.

630
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,840
Speaker 5:  But I guess if you, you know, really are in a pinch, you can do it.

631
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,560
Speaker 5:  I tried some other devices, the MacBook will always charge the

632
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,880
Speaker 5:  phone. The MacBook could have like no power and it will still try to charge

633
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,680
Speaker 5:  the phone. I plugged the iPhone 15 plus into a

634
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,440
Speaker 5:  lightning iPad and what happened was the lightning

635
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,360
Speaker 5:  iPad would start charging for a second and then it would say not charging.

636
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,160
Speaker 5:  'cause I think it's just not enough wattage. I plugged the 15 plus

637
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:13,400
Speaker 5:  into a Windows tablet thing and it would give

638
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,320
Speaker 5:  enough juice to wake the Windows tablet up and then it would try to

639
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,960
Speaker 5:  charge the iPhone. So for the most part you're not really charging

640
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,320
Speaker 5:  larger devices with this, aside from the fact that you can charge the bigger

641
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,640
Speaker 5:  iPhone with the smaller iPhone, which is kind of hilarious. If

642
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,280
Speaker 6:  Your friend with a 15 plus asks you to charge up

643
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,360
Speaker 6:  their phone, that's not a good friend.

644
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:37,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Walk away. I mean where the big wrong in their, in their manage life

645
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,000
Speaker 5:  management where they need, they didn't charge their phone. That gets massive

646
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,040
Speaker 5:  battery life. Yeah,

647
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,640
Speaker 2:  Real friends charge their own phone, is that what you're saying?

648
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,480
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that's their problem.

649
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,440
Speaker 2:  I don't know. Good friends charge their own phone but best friends charge

650
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,320
Speaker 2:  everybody's phone. That's what I always say.

651
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:52,680
Speaker 6:  Maybe

652
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,920
Speaker 5:  The other weird thing you can do while we're on the topic is let me just

653
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,080
Speaker 5:  see if this actually works. I've got a a, a MagSafe charger here. I'm gonna

654
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,040
Speaker 5:  put the phone on the MagSafe charger and watch it start

655
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,920
Speaker 5:  charging and then I'm gonna plug it into another phone through U S B C cable

656
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,600
Speaker 5:  and everybody charges so you can

657
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,280
Speaker 5:  daisy chain.

658
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,080
Speaker 6:  Oh.

659
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,880
Speaker 2:  Oh that's it. That's kind of rad. Yeah,

660
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,280
Speaker 5:  I mean I assume this is gonna stop charging when it like overheats but yeah,

661
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,080
Speaker 5:  all

662
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,840
Speaker 2:  Of these things are like use cases that don't exist, but I think

663
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,680
Speaker 2:  it's delightful. Nonetheless, this is the,

664
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,280
Speaker 5:  The potential of U S B C, the power of U S B C that we've been missing with

665
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,360
Speaker 5:  the iPhone for however many years that's

666
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,160
Speaker 6:  It's here.

667
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,960
Speaker 2:  I love it. All right, well listen, I hope that helps. U S P C is very confusing

668
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,920
Speaker 2:  and if we figure out the actual logic behind all of this, we'll be sure to

669
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,560
Speaker 2:  let you know. But for now, go charge your friend's iPhones, be a good friend.

670
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,920
Speaker 2:  Alright, thank you both. We gotta take a break and then we're gonna come

671
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Speaker 2:  back and talk about the Apple Watch.

704
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,570
Speaker 1:  Welcome

705
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:06,530
Speaker 2:  Back. The iPhones aren't the only new Apple devices coming out

706
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,050
Speaker 2:  this week. There's also the new Apple Watch series nine and the Apple Watch

707
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,090
Speaker 2:  Ultra two. The Verges Victoria song are resident wearer of many

708
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,810
Speaker 2:  fitness watches. Simultaneously reviewed them both and she's been using

709
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:21,610
Speaker 2:  the new watchOS 10 software for a while as well. V and I haven't talked about

710
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,490
Speaker 2:  this yet, but I have a feeling the software is actually the real

711
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,090
Speaker 2:  story of the Apple Watch this year. But let's see if I'm right or not. V's.

712
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:33,050
Speaker 2:  With me here now. Hi Vee. Hello, Dan Seaford still here. Hi Dan. How

713
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,200
Speaker 2:  you doing? Just can't get rid of you this week. No,

714
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,320
Speaker 5:  I'm a cockroach.

715
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:41,440
Speaker 2:  Okay, so my overarching thesis via about

716
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,280
Speaker 2:  these new watches, and I am curious to hear if I'm right, is that the

717
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,880
Speaker 2:  software this year is significantly more interesting than the hardware this

718
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,000
Speaker 2:  year.

719
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,200
Speaker 9:  100000%. Okay. Like the, well, okay

720
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,960
Speaker 9:  100 maybe like 999,000. Okay. Like that

721
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,240
Speaker 9:  1% is so like if we're talking about hardware,

722
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,600
Speaker 9:  the one little tiny stumble in your

723
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,320
Speaker 9:  theory is the S nine sip that enables all the

724
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,320
Speaker 9:  interesting software updates. So it's still software.

725
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:14,480
Speaker 2:  Explain what that, what that actually means in practice.

726
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,400
Speaker 9:  So the SS nine sip is the first, let's say major

727
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,840
Speaker 9:  in scare quotes, major processor update that the Apple Watch has

728
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,520
Speaker 9:  had in a very long time because so far it, the last few years

729
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,760
Speaker 9:  it's been a rebadged version of the processor from the year before.

730
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,600
Speaker 9:  No real meaningful changes in terms of like features

731
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,240
Speaker 9:  that it enables, but this year it's actually got a 30% faster

732
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,000
Speaker 9:  C P U and a four chord neural engine that

733
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,120
Speaker 9:  you know, that enables the double tap feature. It enables

734
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,320
Speaker 9:  a smarter series smarter in the sense that it works offline

735
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,280
Speaker 9:  now and it's supposedly 25% more

736
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,800
Speaker 9:  accurate at dictation and the screens are brighter,

737
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,920
Speaker 9:  yay. 'cause better power efficiency. But they're not gonna give you better

738
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,800
Speaker 9:  battery life for that power efficiency. They're gonna reinvest it into

739
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,480
Speaker 9:  brighter screens.

740
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah, this is the thing I wish Apple would stop doing. Like I, I

741
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,680
Speaker 2:  actually think on most of Apple's devices it's the right call, especially

742
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,640
Speaker 2:  with the MacBooks. I think we've reached a point where like the battery life

743
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,760
Speaker 2:  is terrific sacrificing a bunch of stuff to get me like a few more hours.

744
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,840
Speaker 2:  I'm not sure is all that meaningful. I think especially with the entry level

745
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,280
Speaker 2:  watch in this case the series nine I would take small

746
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,800
Speaker 2:  trade-offs to get like six more hours of battery life out of the thing.

747
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,760
Speaker 2:  It's the only DI device of mine that reliably, consistently dies at this

748
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:36,960
Speaker 2:  point.

749
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,400
Speaker 9:  Oh god David, you just opened the can of worms, which is to say

750
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,040
Speaker 9:  that there are two camps with regards to the Apple watch. Okay.

751
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,840
Speaker 9:  And their battery life. There's the camp that's like, don't even

752
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,960
Speaker 9:  look at me in the face until this Apple watch can last a week.

753
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,480
Speaker 9:  How dare you come back to me after yet another year with

754
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,680
Speaker 9:  18 hours of battery life. I spit, I spit on your gr

755
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,920
Speaker 9:  petie. There's that crowd and then there's the other crowd, which

756
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,760
Speaker 9:  I think Dan belongs to this crowd, which is like I have my little charging

757
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,080
Speaker 9:  routine. My Apple watch is never out of battery.

758
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,600
Speaker 9:  You charge your phone every night. It's not that hard to just

759
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:21,720
Speaker 9:  plop your Apple watch on a charger at like a time when you're not using it

760
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,720
Speaker 9:  like the shower or 10 minutes before bed. Why are you complaining so

761
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:25,920
Speaker 9:  hard?

762
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,240
Speaker 5:  I will just state in my own defense, I would love to not have to have

763
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,920
Speaker 5:  the routine. I just happen to have the routine outta necessity.

764
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,800
Speaker 2:  Can I tell you my problem with this routine? The the correct time

765
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,840
Speaker 2:  you just said it V to charge your watch is while you're in the shower? Yeah

766
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,800
Speaker 2:  and there's something about having a charger in the bathroom that I just

767
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:49,160
Speaker 2:  can't, I can't do it. Maybe it's the specifics of my bathroom. I don't, we

768
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,080
Speaker 2:  don't have to talk a lot about what my bathroom looks like, but the idea

769
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:56,040
Speaker 2:  of just like having a cable dangling in my bathroom waiting for

770
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,600
Speaker 2:  my Apple watch is just like a bridge too far for me. I can't do it. You,

771
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,880
Speaker 9:  You could just put it in your bedroom and just go back to your bedroom after

772
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,440
Speaker 9:  your shower. But I mean

773
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,400
Speaker 5:  See David, David is in a mansion, his bedroom in his bathroom

774
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,480
Speaker 5:  or like four football fields apart, they're in separate wing. He's gonna

775
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,280
Speaker 5:  miss all those steps.

776
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,120
Speaker 2:  Who has the time? I know. No, my real problem is I forget to take it off

777
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,840
Speaker 2:  until I'm already in the shower and then I just kind of like huck it over

778
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,680
Speaker 2:  to the sink and that's my charging strategy. But the actual features here,

779
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,800
Speaker 2:  you basically named the three things I wanna talk about and it seems like

780
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,920
Speaker 2:  from a pure hardware perspective they're so similar that you couldn't

781
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,720
Speaker 2:  tell which watch was which, right? Like you had the Ultra and the

782
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,200
Speaker 2:  Ultra two and they're the same damn thing as far as like what the actual

783
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,440
Speaker 2:  thing looks and feels like, right?

784
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:41,640
Speaker 9:  Yeah. And I like, I've told this story before, but when I was at

785
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,320
Speaker 9:  Apple Park and I had my Ultra out and I was you know, taking

786
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,200
Speaker 9:  comparison photos like this representative very well-meaning comes

787
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,880
Speaker 9:  up to me, she's like, can you put your Ultra away? We

788
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,320
Speaker 9:  wouldn't want you to lose it. And that's because it looks

789
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:00,280
Speaker 9:  exactly the same. I've actually had to have a code this week when I'm

790
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,480
Speaker 9:  switching straps. I'm where I say out loud

791
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,040
Speaker 9:  the Ultra is the one with the gray strap, the Ultra two is

792
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,400
Speaker 9:  the one with the pink strap. Like I've, I've basically been keeping

793
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,600
Speaker 9:  the new ones in pink because pink is what's new. Love it. And

794
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,120
Speaker 9:  I had to do that because even the back crystal doesn't say Ultra two, it

795
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,000
Speaker 9:  says Ultra. So there's really no

796
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,960
Speaker 9:  way to tell unless I like I have terrible eyesight if you

797
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,400
Speaker 9:  read my reviews, you know, I complain about readability all the time, but

798
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,320
Speaker 9:  I basically have to take the original Ultra straight up to my face and

799
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,040
Speaker 9:  go, which one has that minuscule nick that I got one time that

800
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:42,000
Speaker 9:  only I know where it is. And that's how I tell the Ultra and

801
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,360
Speaker 9:  the Ultra two apart as far as my review units go.

802
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,080
Speaker 2:  Okay, good. So, we can just leave the hardware aside because it is what it

803
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,680
Speaker 2:  is. The double tap seems like the thing, right? Like it's the thing Apple

804
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,320
Speaker 2:  talked the most about. This feature has like been around for a while

805
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,200
Speaker 2:  in some accessibility ways. Like just walk me through kind of how this thing

806
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,040
Speaker 2:  like fits into your life as a watch wearer.

807
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,440
Speaker 9:  So I actually think this is potentially one of the most

808
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,280
Speaker 9:  significant updates just that Apple's ever put out. But

809
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:13,240
Speaker 9:  it's just not flashy, right? First of all, it's in some capacity. It's been

810
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,920
Speaker 9:  around since watchOS eight and assistive touch right now that

811
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:20,920
Speaker 9:  tech is just being repurposed in a more general use capacity.

812
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:25,000
Speaker 9:  It's supposedly, it's built into the system. So it's more

813
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:28,960
Speaker 9:  contextual. You don't have to do anything. Whereas with assistive touch,

814
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:33,200
Speaker 9:  you have to go into the accessibility settings, you have to enable it and

815
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,120
Speaker 9:  you have to program it because for some people with limb differences, this

816
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,400
Speaker 9:  is the only possible way for them to control the watch. It's how they're

817
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,480
Speaker 9:  gonna navigate menus, it's how they're gonna operate the digital crown. If

818
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,680
Speaker 9:  they have an alter, it's how they're gonna press the action button.

819
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,160
Speaker 9:  So it's, it's much more comprehensive and there's more gestures involved.

820
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,000
Speaker 9:  There's a clench gesture, there's a single tap gesture. It there's,

821
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,960
Speaker 9:  there's a, there's four actual gestures that you do with assistive touch.

822
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,280
Speaker 9:  But double tap is just the double tap or more accurately the pinchy

823
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,240
Speaker 9:  pinch. The pinchy pinch or the pinching motion.

824
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:10,560
Speaker 9:  And you basically use it to control the primary

825
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,720
Speaker 9:  function of an app. And what that means is, say you get a phone call,

826
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,600
Speaker 9:  you pinchy pinch, it's gonna answer the phone call when you're like, I'm

827
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,960
Speaker 9:  done with you. I'm gonna hang up in a rage. Then you pinchy pinch again and

828
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,600
Speaker 9:  then it hangs up.

829
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,760
Speaker 2:  Can you rage pinchy, pinch? I'm not sure you could rage pinchy, pinch you

830
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,320
Speaker 2:  rage. That doesn't skip rage. You can rage pinchy, pinch.

831
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,040
Speaker 9:  You just do it really aggressively. Like you're an angry lobster. You just

832
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,440
Speaker 9:  go, ah,

833
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,600
Speaker 2:  I like it. And that's,

834
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:32,960
Speaker 9:  That's,

835
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,240
Speaker 5:  I can't wait to see the Wall Street rows in, out on the street

836
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:41,160
Speaker 5:  just screaming at their assistant and then really violently pinching

837
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,000
Speaker 5:  to hang up at them.

838
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,720
Speaker 2:  I feel like you need to wear like castanets so that it like makes a loud

839
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,240
Speaker 2:  noise when you pinchy pinch. That's how you really get your feelings across.

840
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,640
Speaker 2:  Yeah, so that, that thing you just described actually is one of the questions

841
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,760
Speaker 2:  I have about Watch West 10. 'cause that that idea that it's like the primary

842
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:00,920
Speaker 2:  thing makes obvious sense to me in some ways, right? Like it's a, it,

843
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:04,160
Speaker 2:  it should pause my music if my music is playing. But there are other ways

844
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,080
Speaker 2:  where, what is the primary thing I'm supposed to do with the tap here

845
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,880
Speaker 2:  is substantially less obvious. And you're, you're nodding like that has been

846
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,800
Speaker 2:  true in practice. Has that been true in practice?

847
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,520
Speaker 9:  Yes. Okay. Yes, it absolutely has. And you know, apple acknowledges this

848
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,000
Speaker 9:  to an extent because there are two circumstances where you can

849
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,880
Speaker 9:  customize what the pinch does. So that first is, as you mentioned,

850
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:28,640
Speaker 9:  music playback. So you can do it and it can pause

851
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,760
Speaker 9:  or it can play your, your music. But I actually, that's not

852
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,240
Speaker 9:  intuitively what I would want it to do. What I would want it to do is

853
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,520
Speaker 9:  skip a track and you can, you know, edit it so that it skips a

854
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,160
Speaker 9:  track. So I was just in the car the other day driving and I was like, Nope,

855
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,040
Speaker 9:  not this. Nope, not this. Nope, not this. I'm just pinching while I'm driving.

856
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,360
Speaker 9:  And that's kind of actually safer than me

857
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,040
Speaker 9:  reaching over to the car in infotainment and just trying to

858
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:00,400
Speaker 9:  flip through that way. So that's, that's one way you can customize

859
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,200
Speaker 9:  it. The other way you can customize it and it has to do with Apple intuiting.

860
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,080
Speaker 9:  What you want is the smart stack. So the smart stack is new with

861
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,360
Speaker 9:  watch OSS 10 'cause it's widgets just everywhere in watch OSS 10

862
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,960
Speaker 9:  and the smart stack, you can either double pinch to scroll

863
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,520
Speaker 9:  through your smart stack or you can double pinch to

864
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,640
Speaker 9:  select the first stack and only the first stack.

865
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,880
Speaker 9:  And you know, apple's like if they do their job right and if they

866
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,760
Speaker 9:  anticipate which widget you need at the right time of day so that whenever

867
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,720
Speaker 9:  you bring up your widgets, you just wanna pick the first one there,

868
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,920
Speaker 9:  you can pinch and select it. Which to me I'm like wow, that's,

869
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,240
Speaker 9:  that's almost never gonna

870
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,200
Speaker 5:  But don't, in order to bring up the widgets, you have to scroll the digital

871
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,680
Speaker 5:  crown or swipe up on the screen. So you're already, you

872
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,600
Speaker 9:  Can, you can pinch so you just wake it up, pinch brings up

873
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,440
Speaker 9:  the widgets and then the second pinch will either scroll through, ah,

874
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,680
Speaker 9:  or select that first top one. So for me, testing

875
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,280
Speaker 9:  that's been a nightmare because the first one that pops up has been the tips

876
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:07,240
Speaker 9:  thing that I just can't get to go away, which goes away after

877
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,200
Speaker 9:  a while. But it's like I don't need these tips so I can't actually use

878
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,640
Speaker 9:  that particular function. But those are the only two ways you can customize

879
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,080
Speaker 9:  it. And for me with messages, like say I get a text,

880
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:22,240
Speaker 9:  you pinchy pinch and it'll bring up the voice message reply.

881
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,640
Speaker 9:  Makes sense. That makes total sense. If you're just trying to keep things

882
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,160
Speaker 9:  hands free or single handed. For me though, I wanna

883
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,280
Speaker 9:  scroll through my quick replies and select one. I would love

884
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,520
Speaker 9:  to do that but that's kind of hard because pinching to scroll through your

885
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,280
Speaker 9:  quick replies and then pausing and then pinching again to select it

886
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:44,440
Speaker 9:  kind of is something that has to be a lot more intuitive. You can do that

887
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,240
Speaker 9:  in assistive touch but you can't really do that with the double

888
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,880
Speaker 9:  tap. But that is what I wish I could do with it.

889
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,400
Speaker 2:  Dan, you and I are both sickos for customization. I would

890
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,720
Speaker 2:  say as a, as a general rule, this strikes me as the kind of thing I would

891
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,600
Speaker 2:  want tons of control over. Like I should be able to decide in every single

892
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,480
Speaker 2:  app what the double tap does. Yeah,

893
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:09,520
Speaker 5:  Well I think we should, we should clarify that it does nothing in third party

894
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:09,800
Speaker 5:  apps.

895
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Wait, is that, oh okay. So developers can do it, they just haven't

896
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,600
Speaker 2:  yet. Okay.

897
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:17,520
Speaker 5:  No, they, they actually can't. What v correct me if I get

898
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,160
Speaker 5:  this wrong. Developers can interact with double tap through

899
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,880
Speaker 5:  notification. So basically if you get a notification in and you double tap

900
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:28,920
Speaker 5:  it will do what is like the default action on that notification. And developers

901
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,720
Speaker 5:  can define that default action. So if you've got a notification that's like

902
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:35,280
Speaker 5:  an email and the default action is a delete, you can double tap to delete

903
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,840
Speaker 5:  it or you can double tap to reply to a message if it's in WhatsApp or something

904
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,560
Speaker 5:  outside of Apple's messages. But if you are in a third party app, double

905
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,400
Speaker 5:  tap doesn't do anything. Is that correct? V

906
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,400
Speaker 9:  Oh so far I think, I think you're right. I haven't been able to use it with

907
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,520
Speaker 9:  any third party, third party app right now. But this is also just like the

908
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,720
Speaker 9:  first implementation of it. I imagine there's gonna be a lot of

909
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,880
Speaker 9:  trial and error as people use this for the first time. And I could see,

910
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,200
Speaker 9:  I could see ways, ways down that third party apps

911
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:07,000
Speaker 9:  will eventually get some ability to do it. But the problem

912
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,600
Speaker 9:  really is that this is supposed to be contextual and intuitive.

913
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:15,360
Speaker 9:  So you're having people, you're basically trying to mind read what

914
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,320
Speaker 9:  people are gonna try and pinch for. And it's funny

915
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,280
Speaker 9:  because you know, I have a beta version with this enabled,

916
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,680
Speaker 9:  there's no explanation on my version. I imagine there will be some

917
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:31,720
Speaker 9:  short walkthrough in like the Tips app when Apple releases this

918
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,360
Speaker 9:  to the public. But there's no real explanation of what apps

919
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:39,440
Speaker 9:  this works with and what it'll do within those apps. You just kind of have

920
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,320
Speaker 9:  to go into the app and start like pinching like a weirdo and

921
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,240
Speaker 9:  seeing what it does. And there's a little glyph or an icon that

922
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,680
Speaker 9:  appears that shows you that you've just done it. And when you can't

923
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:54,920
Speaker 9:  have any double tap gesture, it'll just like do a little

924
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:58,800
Speaker 9:  shake that's like, nuh, can't do it. So I've just been like this

925
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,600
Speaker 9:  past few days just sitting there just going like, oh does this, does this

926
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,400
Speaker 9:  work? Pinch, pinch, oh no, okay, can't do that. Does this work? Pinch,

927
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,000
Speaker 9:  pinch? Oh no, can't do that. So it can be

928
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:14,000
Speaker 9:  really intuitive and also weirdly frustrating 'cause

929
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,440
Speaker 9:  you don't know when you're gonna run up against the wall of the, the pinch

930
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,280
Speaker 9:  not working like timers is the other example I'm gonna use. If

931
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,160
Speaker 9:  you have talked to Siri and you have a, and you have a timer going and

932
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:28,960
Speaker 9:  that timer app is front and center, when you do the

933
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,920
Speaker 9:  the double tap, it'll pause the timer and then you can, you know, restart

934
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,640
Speaker 9:  the timer and when it ends you can close the timer. I want what if I want

935
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,200
Speaker 9:  a timer to restart? I, I have several like Pomodoro

936
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,320
Speaker 9:  method nonsense where I just want to restart a timer as soon as it's done.

937
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:48,120
Speaker 9:  Can't do that. I actually have to go and figure out whether I'm gonna ask

938
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:52,000
Speaker 9:  Siri to set another timer or whether I'm gonna go in manually and set that

939
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:55,760
Speaker 9:  timer. So that's annoying. And then also if the, the, the

940
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,720
Speaker 9:  timer app goes away, it's not front and center then no amount

941
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,520
Speaker 9:  of pinching you're gonna do is really gonna change anything until it goes

942
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:06,320
Speaker 9:  off. So if you wanna pause the, the timer, while the timer app is not front

943
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,200
Speaker 9:  and center, you can't do anything. So it's sort of like, that's

944
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:14,080
Speaker 9:  weirdly annoying for me. I don't know if it'll be weirdly annoying for everyone.

945
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:14,720
Speaker 9:  It

946
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,400
Speaker 2:  Just strikes me as a classic Apple kind of being too clever by half

947
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:22,480
Speaker 2:  thing and like the thing it got really right with the action button was

948
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,600
Speaker 2:  it was just like, just do just do whatever you want. Like here's some options.

949
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,920
Speaker 2:  We have some ideas. Just do just action

950
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,080
Speaker 5:  Action button on the phone. Yes. Let's, let's clarify.

951
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,840
Speaker 2:  No, you're, that's absolutely right. But the action button and the iPhone

952
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,480
Speaker 2:  15, which we were just talking about that you have some control over and

953
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,400
Speaker 2:  there's a cool interface for it and they're like, this will work. This is

954
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,200
Speaker 2:  the equivalent of if they had taken the action button on the phone and been

955
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,760
Speaker 2:  like in every app it will do the thing we think it should do. It's like Apple.

956
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:49,600
Speaker 2:  Like sometimes that thing is obvious. If I open the camera app on my

957
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,800
Speaker 2:  iPhone, it should be the shutter button and it is and that kicks ass sometimes

958
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,080
Speaker 2:  I want it to do something and I should be able to make it do that thing.

959
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,600
Speaker 2:  And I feel like so many times with the watch Apple is like, this is a small

960
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,360
Speaker 2:  screen, people don't wanna spend too much time on it. We have to do all the

961
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,320
Speaker 2:  work magically for them. And sometimes it works and way too

962
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,000
Speaker 2:  often I feel like it doesn't, and speaking of things that way too often

963
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,600
Speaker 2:  don't work. Siri is the other thing I was curious about because Apple made

964
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,120
Speaker 2:  a bunch of noise about Siri being offline and working on device,

965
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:22,600
Speaker 2:  which if it is successful, it's a huge deal for the watch, right? Like it,

966
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,010
Speaker 2:  it opens, opens up all kinds of things you can do if you don't have a cellular

967
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,640
Speaker 2:  device, if you're out in the world doing stuff like potentially a big deal.

968
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:30,000
Speaker 2:  What have you seen so far?

969
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,280
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it works. It just works like, okay wait, hold

970
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,800
Speaker 2:  On, hold on. Do you want to be on the record saying Siri works? I just like,

971
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,040
Speaker 2:  I just wanna be so clear about what you just, I'm

972
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,960
Speaker 9:  Getting into caveats. Just, just gimme a second to get into the

973
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:48,200
Speaker 9:  of this here. Okay. So you know, it does now work

974
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:52,080
Speaker 9:  if you don't have your phone and you're not in any kind of internet

975
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,000
Speaker 9:  connection. So like your laundry room is in your basement, you

976
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:59,960
Speaker 9:  left your phone upstairs, your hands are tied up and you wanna

977
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,240
Speaker 9:  set the stupid laundry timer so that you know when to go get your laundry.

978
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:08,240
Speaker 9:  Now you can say like, hey set this timer and it'll do it.

979
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:11,560
Speaker 9:  Which feels like a thing that it should have been able to do already.

980
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,600
Speaker 2:  This happened to me by the way, literally this morning I was doing daycare

981
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:18,560
Speaker 2:  drop off with my kid, needed to remind myself to do something

982
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,120
Speaker 2:  had I had left my phone at home and my watch just was useless to me. Yeah,

983
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:25,560
Speaker 2:  like this very simple basic thing that it ought to be able to do it couldn't

984
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:25,920
Speaker 2:  do. Yeah,

985
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,080
Speaker 9:  It can do that now. That's very, it's pretty reliably. I turned

986
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,600
Speaker 9:  airplane mode on my phone and the watch on and made sure

987
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,520
Speaker 9:  that there was no wifi connection still and it was, it was able to do

988
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,160
Speaker 9:  stuff. It was even able to pull weather updates because it had pulled that

989
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,800
Speaker 9:  already. It may not have been the most accurate weather update at that point

990
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,720
Speaker 9:  in time, but it was able to like give me an update which I

991
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,600
Speaker 9:  had not been expecting because as I understand it, if it needs to pull some

992
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,440
Speaker 9:  sort of data from the internet, it still needs the internet connection.

993
00:57:56,670 --> 00:58:00,600
Speaker 9:  It's more so that you can do tasks like, oh, set a

994
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:04,480
Speaker 9:  timer or I guess in my case, set a workout like I

995
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,440
Speaker 9:  don't know if you're in the trails of, of like Missouri somewhere where

996
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,840
Speaker 9:  there's no any kind of internet connection and your phone doesn't even have

997
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,560
Speaker 9:  an internet connection. Well now you can hands-free set a workout,

998
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:19,400
Speaker 9:  which there is a use case for that, but I think for most people that's not

999
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,240
Speaker 9:  a thing that they've necessarily thought to do, but it can do it now.

1000
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,560
Speaker 9:  So yay za

1001
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:28,440
Speaker 5:  I've had the opportunity to test the new Siri as well. I, I haven't, my demo

1002
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,760
Speaker 5:  unit doesn't have the double tap, but I do have the new Siri and I think

1003
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,560
Speaker 5:  the thing that is actually impactful is for me at least when I'm outside

1004
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,960
Speaker 5:  on the grill, I set timers for how long to keep leave the burgers on before

1005
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,000
Speaker 5:  I need to flip 'em or whatever. And because I'm like on the edge of my wifi

1006
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,880
Speaker 5:  network, it like I will watch the, I will do the, the command

1007
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,680
Speaker 5:  and watch the watch figure itself out. And so, but with the series

1008
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,960
Speaker 5:  nine I was able to just say, set a timer for five minutes and it just did

1009
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,840
Speaker 5:  it. And so like I think those are like more practical use cases for where

1010
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,680
Speaker 5:  this better improved on-device Siri is going to make an impact.

1011
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,200
Speaker 5:  I will add that this new Siri doesn't do anything that the old

1012
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:07,600
Speaker 5:  Siri couldn't do. So it's not like Siri gets smarter or more capable,

1013
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:11,760
Speaker 5:  it's just, it works better at the things that it could already do because

1014
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:15,280
Speaker 5:  it doesn't have to send your voice command out to the internet,

1015
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,160
Speaker 5:  transcribe it and bring it back down to the watch.

1016
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,720
Speaker 2:  My biggest issue with Siri on the watch has always been that it, it seems

1017
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:24,400
Speaker 2:  to just fail completely a lot more often than Siri

1018
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,200
Speaker 2:  elsewhere with really basic things like trying to set a reminder

1019
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:32,160
Speaker 2:  or add something to my calendar or set a timer even it much

1020
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,880
Speaker 2:  more often does the thing where it thinks and then it still thinks and then

1021
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,520
Speaker 2:  nothing happens. And my assumption has always been that's because of this

1022
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,800
Speaker 2:  sort of like daisy chain of connections it's having to do in order to get

1023
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,000
Speaker 2:  the information back to the watch. Have you noticed that being any better

1024
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,920
Speaker 2:  on the watch because it's able to run locally? I would think it would just

1025
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,520
Speaker 2:  be able to do more things more reliably.

1026
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:55,080
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it has been more reliable for me except with

1027
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:59,080
Speaker 9:  understanding me that is just the same level of,

1028
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:03,040
Speaker 9:  you know, like it, it's better like it can finally understand

1029
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,680
Speaker 9:  Mahershala Ali's name, which I've been using for years as a litmus test

1030
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:07,200
Speaker 9:  progress,

1031
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:07,520
Speaker 2:  Whether

1032
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:11,440
Speaker 9:  It can understand me and you know, it's gotten better over the years like

1033
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,760
Speaker 9:  four or five years ago it was just like Herschel Walker and it's like, no

1034
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,960
Speaker 9:  that's, that's not what I said.

1035
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,680
Speaker 2:  It's a different guy. Yeah,

1036
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:21,760
Speaker 9:  Completely different name. But you know, I, I live in a

1037
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,040
Speaker 9:  community where it's mixed language. I have to communicate with people

1038
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:29,520
Speaker 9:  with names that are not English. And with that respect

1039
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:33,320
Speaker 9:  it is still not great. Like I was, I was

1040
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:37,200
Speaker 9:  messaging my friend and I was like, oh New K-pop album come out, do

1041
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:41,480
Speaker 9:  we love him? And it's like Joe Fang Fu or something like that

1042
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,880
Speaker 9:  and it was like, no that's not his name. Oh boy, that's

1043
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,720
Speaker 9:  not how it works. Okay. We, we still have to do the thing where when I am

1044
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:53,360
Speaker 9:  messaging my friends and with like Korean lone words

1045
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:57,400
Speaker 9:  where I have to go like bull gogi for it to understand

1046
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:01,160
Speaker 9:  me and it for it to be clear and not to be ridiculous And we had a lot of

1047
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,680
Speaker 9:  fun testing the dictation, our video producer had me

1048
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:09,080
Speaker 9:  rap alphabet aerobics and that was certainly

1049
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,200
Speaker 9:  a time I did a bunch of tongue twisters about Betty and her

1050
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,120
Speaker 9:  bitter butter and her better butter and buying them. And for

1051
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,800
Speaker 9:  the most part I wanna say both my S eight powered

1052
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:24,920
Speaker 9:  Ultra and the S nine powered series nine kind

1053
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,560
Speaker 9:  of overall did about the same in terms of accuracy. Okay.

1054
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:32,400
Speaker 9:  So I don't know if that's just me and the way I pronounce and

1055
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:36,200
Speaker 9:  as Owen says, wow you talk fast. So I'm not sure

1056
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,880
Speaker 9:  if I am like having issues because I'm in an edge case of people

1057
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,560
Speaker 9:  who talk at the speed of New York, but it's, it's, it's

1058
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:48,360
Speaker 9:  better just not so much better that if you upgraded now

1059
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:52,120
Speaker 9:  you'd be like, oh my god they finally fixed Siri. That kind of thing.

1060
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:56,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that tracks so full takeaway here. Like it seems to

1061
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,160
Speaker 2:  me that if you bought a watch in the last couple of years, you're gonna get

1062
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,040
Speaker 2:  watchOS 10. Is double tap coming to these other devices or is that only in

1063
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,160
Speaker 2:  the new stuff? Okay, that

1064
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,640
Speaker 9:  Is only on the new watches along with the precision finding,

1065
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:12,600
Speaker 9:  right? Those are only on the new watches and as far as I understand it,

1066
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:16,160
Speaker 9:  it's because, you know, some people have been like why Assistive Touch works

1067
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:20,120
Speaker 9:  on the older watches, why won't double touch work on those watches? And it's

1068
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:23,840
Speaker 9:  because Assistive Touch is powered on the C P U directly. It's very

1069
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,800
Speaker 9:  power intensive. Double tap is powered by the neural engine

1070
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:32,080
Speaker 9:  so it can be offloaded a bit and is a lot more power efficient and can run

1071
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:35,520
Speaker 9:  in the background. That's, that's the line they're giving all of us. So

1072
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:40,240
Speaker 9:  I I like my interpretation is if they were to put double tap on the older

1073
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,080
Speaker 9:  watches, your battery life would be even more in the toilet than it currently

1074
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:47,960
Speaker 9:  is. So basically in my review I say if you have a series

1075
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,400
Speaker 9:  seven, eight or an original Ultra cool jets

1076
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:55,600
Speaker 9:  contribute to apple's carbon neutral plans and don't buy yourself a new box

1077
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:55,920
Speaker 9:  there.

1078
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,160
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it seems like even if double tap is like really meaningful to you,

1079
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:03,560
Speaker 2:  waiting a year for like developers to figure it out and the feature will

1080
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:07,440
Speaker 2:  get better. Seems like the move Dan, you're nodding like you,

1081
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,120
Speaker 2:  you agree with me.

1082
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:12,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think in a year double tap will be more useful. Maybe

1083
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:15,440
Speaker 5:  Apple will have opened it up to third party developers in a more meaningful

1084
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,240
Speaker 5:  way. Maybe we'll have other gestures arriving that like

1085
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,400
Speaker 5:  use the same kind of concept and logic that allows you to do this thing

1086
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:26,240
Speaker 5:  for now. If you have the new watches, if you get the new watches, it's neat.

1087
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:30,520
Speaker 5:  But I think V would agree that it's not a like absolute must have feature.

1088
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:35,080
Speaker 9:  No, and you can, you can experiment if you have a, a seven or eight

1089
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:38,920
Speaker 9:  with assistive touch to see whether just your control is something you

1090
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,680
Speaker 9:  even like. 'cause if you're like, oh this whatever, I'm not passionate about

1091
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,840
Speaker 9:  this, then you really don't need, you have like empirical evidence that you

1092
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:49,480
Speaker 9:  don't need to update just for double tap. I will say that going forward,

1093
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,720
Speaker 9:  I think the combination of rearranging the watch to be very

1094
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:57,680
Speaker 9:  widget centric and double tap kind of is like

1095
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,360
Speaker 9:  a fundamental groundwork that they're laying to change the way that we

1096
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,400
Speaker 9:  interact with the device. Yeah, so it's weird because on that one hand I'm

1097
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,320
Speaker 9:  seeing that and I'm, and I I like, I'm like, oh I see what you're doing,

1098
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,080
Speaker 9:  I see what you're doing. You are changing how we

1099
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:16,040
Speaker 9:  fundamentally interact with these devices. But you're doing it in a

1100
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,560
Speaker 9:  way where it's like, oh, what if I left this book of secrets out

1101
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:23,960
Speaker 9:  on this table who is curious enough to come and read this book of

1102
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,680
Speaker 9:  secrets and let's see what they do with that. And they're in the bushes somewhere

1103
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,080
Speaker 9:  in the bag with their little binoculars going, what are they doing?

1104
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:35,160
Speaker 9:  That's kind of what this is. They're, they're laying some very important

1105
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,920
Speaker 9:  groundwork to change the Apple watch to be a single handed device.

1106
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:42,320
Speaker 9:  Much in the way that, you know, Dan pointed this out to be more like the

1107
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,840
Speaker 9:  iPhone, which is a, you know, if you get it in the right size, everyone will

1108
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,800
Speaker 9:  agree that that it's a single handed device and you're

1109
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,760
Speaker 9:  making it so that it's much more different. It's not just a mini

1110
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,600
Speaker 9:  phone on your wrist because the way that these new apps have been redesigned

1111
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:01,520
Speaker 9:  and that the way the widget stack works on the Apple Watch, you don't

1112
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:05,680
Speaker 9:  need quite as much of your phone because there is a lot of

1113
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,280
Speaker 9:  information that's glanceable and a lot of information that you can operate

1114
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:13,400
Speaker 9:  with one hand now and that's not something that you've really been able to

1115
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:17,440
Speaker 9:  do before. So I think once this gets refined going forward,

1116
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:21,400
Speaker 9:  maybe, I don't wanna say for the 10, but maybe the 11 or the 12,

1117
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,280
Speaker 9:  I don't think we'll be using these watches in the same way that we currently

1118
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:25,440
Speaker 9:  do.

1119
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,920
Speaker 2:  I like it. Alright, thank you both. We gotta take one more break and then

1120
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,840
Speaker 2:  we're gonna switch things up a little bit and talk about how we take these

1121
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:36,560
Speaker 2:  devices, which millions or tens of millions or billions of people

1122
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:40,000
Speaker 2:  buy and make them feel a lot more like ours.

1123
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:41,240
Speaker 2:  We'll be right back.

01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,640
Speaker 8:  this time they're telling the real stories behind the rise of ai. Starting

1128
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:04,040
Speaker 8:  in the 2010s, the dream of artificial intelligence became a real

1129
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:07,880
Speaker 8:  possibility that companies like Google and Meta knew they'd have to harness

1130
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,840
Speaker 8:  it if they were going to win the AI race. In fact, some companies saw it

1131
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:15,520
Speaker 8:  as key to their very survival, but researchers within each company

1132
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,280
Speaker 8:  sounded the alarm that if they move too fast, the consequences

1133
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:23,160
Speaker 8:  could be devastating. It's the newest season of business Wars, the

1134
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,840
Speaker 8:  rise of AI where tech behemoths fight to dominate the artificial

1148
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:28,170
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. One of the things I like about this time of year is that it

1149
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:31,210
Speaker 2:  ends up being phone cleaning time. It's like spring cleaning in the spring

1150
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:35,170
Speaker 2:  phone cleaning in the fall. Particularly if you're an

1151
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:39,010
Speaker 2:  iPhone user, this is the time of year you probably get some new software

1152
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:42,890
Speaker 2:  with some new features, some new widgets, a bunch of weird new

1153
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:46,890
Speaker 2:  gestures and interaction ideas and it's just a fun moment

1154
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:50,970
Speaker 2:  to kind of take stock of how you use your phone, which apps get a

1155
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:54,930
Speaker 2:  spot on your home screen, all that good stuff. This year's iOS,

1156
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:59,050
Speaker 2:  iOS 17 brings one of the biggest changes in a while, which is one

1157
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:02,810
Speaker 2:  we've already been talking about in this episode. Interactive widgets instead

1158
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:06,490
Speaker 2:  of widgets just being things you look at, they're now things you

1159
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:10,490
Speaker 2:  can do. And widgets are actually a big feature of pretty much all

1160
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:14,410
Speaker 2:  of Apple's new software. This year the Apple Watch got a redesign with watchOS

1161
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:18,400
Speaker 2:  10. So it's basically now just a clock and a bunch of widgets. macOS is

1162
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,360
Speaker 2:  getting widgets with Sonoma. The iPad got widgets on the lock screen. It's

1163
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,120
Speaker 2:  just widgets all the way down y'all. It's great. Oh, and I should say

1164
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:29,640
Speaker 2:  before we get too far into this, if you're yelling at your podcast player

1165
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,800
Speaker 2:  right now, Android did it first. Please know that I know

1166
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:37,320
Speaker 2:  and I'm with you. And Android widgets have been way better than iOS widgets

1167
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:41,280
Speaker 2:  for years. That is absolutely true, but this is new for the

1168
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:45,200
Speaker 2:  iPhone users so you know, let them have this one. Anyway, as all

1169
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,000
Speaker 2:  of this has been coming out, I've been trying to figure out not just wi widgets

1170
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,800
Speaker 2:  I want to use, but how to think about widgets and how widgets work

1171
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:56,560
Speaker 2:  across all of these devices. Just on the iPhone you have home

1172
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,280
Speaker 2:  screen widgets and lock screen widgets. There's the dynamic island, there's

1173
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,960
Speaker 2:  live activities, there's just a lot of different ways that information

1174
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:08,040
Speaker 2:  moves around the iPhone and it can be kind of confusing. So to

1175
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,360
Speaker 2:  figure it out, I decided to call up the expert David Smith.

1176
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:14,840
Speaker 10:  Apple added widgets and it was great and they worked and it didn't have

1177
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,920
Speaker 10:  any negative impacts, it was only positive ones.

1178
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:20,720
Speaker 2:  David makes an app called Widget Smith that is probably the most

1179
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:25,160
Speaker 2:  powerful and most successful widget making app on the planet. It was a

1180
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,920
Speaker 2:  massive hit when it first came out in 2020, which you might remember was

1181
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:32,920
Speaker 2:  iOS 14, which was when Home Screen Widgets came to the iPhone for the first

1182
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,640
Speaker 2:  time this year for iOS 17, he's got a big update to

1183
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,560
Speaker 2:  Widgetsmith with a bunch of really cool interactive widgets. You

1184
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,000
Speaker 2:  can now scroll the weather on your home screen. There's a way to flip through

1185
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,680
Speaker 2:  your music, like the cover flow thing that used to be in the iPod. It's just

1186
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,640
Speaker 2:  delightful. David knows how widgets work better than just about anybody and

1187
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,720
Speaker 2:  I think he understands how Apple thinks about them too, which is really helpful.

1188
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:58,360
Speaker 2:  So I called him up and asked him all of my questions starting with the most

1189
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:02,320
Speaker 2:  burning one, oddly enough. Is it as surprising to you as it is to me

1190
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:04,240
Speaker 2:  that people love widgets this much?

1191
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:10,400
Speaker 10:  Yes, I, I mean, I think, I mean I, I don't know if I really expected widgets

1192
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,000
Speaker 10:  to be as big as they were when I started getting into the widget business.

1193
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:17,320
Speaker 10:  Like Widget Smith was not something that I expected it to ever be. This

1194
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,440
Speaker 10:  massive app that kind of had a viral moment and like took over the world

1195
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:23,280
Speaker 10:  for a few weeks and like it was that, like I did not expect that at all.

1196
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,480
Speaker 10:  I, I, I think I was excited about widgets when they first came out, but

1197
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,440
Speaker 10:  it was, that definitely had no expectation for just how much like pent up

1198
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,920
Speaker 10:  demand there is for that kind of thing that people really want that kind

1199
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,280
Speaker 10:  of interaction and that kind of experience. And so yeah, I mean it definitely

1200
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:39,160
Speaker 10:  feels like, oh and it just keeps coming like this year I think other than

1201
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:43,200
Speaker 10:  Apple TV widgets are everywhere on Apple's platforms now. It's

1202
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,800
Speaker 10:  really true. So it was definitely like, okay, well I guess next year I know

1203
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,160
Speaker 10:  what to expect at the, you know, somehow it's gonna be widgets on Apple

1204
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:52,520
Speaker 10:  TV 'cause they just, you know, complete the set. But yeah, it's a little

1205
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:52,760
Speaker 10:  wild.

1206
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:56,160
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I have to say I did not expect Widgetsmith to get as big as it did

1207
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:00,120
Speaker 2:  either. I, I sort of put it in the like shortcuts bucket at first

1208
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:03,440
Speaker 2:  where it's like, this is a cool thing, it's a little, you know,

1209
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:06,440
Speaker 2:  fiddly and finicky and there's a lot of people who like that, but this is

1210
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,000
Speaker 2:  not necessarily going to be sort of a mainstream thing. But the

1211
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:14,120
Speaker 2:  number of people who even in the early days were

1212
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,960
Speaker 2:  like willing to do the work to make a photo widget that looked

1213
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:21,880
Speaker 2:  nice on their home screen was just like orders of magnitude bigger

1214
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:25,240
Speaker 2:  than I would've expected. It was wild the customization people started doing,

1215
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:28,120
Speaker 2:  it's the minute they were able to do it and the amount of work that they

1216
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,520
Speaker 2:  would put in to do it just kind of blew my mind from the very beginning and

1217
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,920
Speaker 2:  I've like not really forgotten that lesson since then.

1218
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:37,160
Speaker 10:  I mean it certainly helped that it launched in 2020 when I think there was

1219
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,440
Speaker 10:  a lot of people with a lot of time on their hands just sort of to, to work

1220
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,960
Speaker 10:  on that level. But yeah, like it, it, the amount that people care about

1221
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,480
Speaker 10:  how what their home screen looks like is dramatic. Like there's a

1222
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:50,880
Speaker 10:  meaningful thing that people really care about, you know, how what exactly

1223
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,400
Speaker 10:  what their home screen looks like. Whether what colors it is, what fonts

1224
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,760
Speaker 10:  it is, the layout of it and they're willing to put in the effort to,

1225
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,400
Speaker 10:  to make that happen. And so yeah, it's like I definitely, when I launched

1226
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,960
Speaker 10:  Widgetsmith, I think very much shortcut, this is a great analogy that I

1227
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,080
Speaker 10:  was like, oh this is a cool niche feature for like, you know, sort of power

1228
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:09,160
Speaker 10:  usy kind of people who enjoy really, you know, sort of tweaking and fiddling

1229
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:12,440
Speaker 10:  with things. And it turned out actually no, it's everyone and you know,

1230
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:16,360
Speaker 10:  it's like middle school kids through like, you know, retirees who

1231
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:19,840
Speaker 10:  are all just, they, they just want to have, you know, the this device that

1232
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,760
Speaker 10:  they spend so much of their day looking at, they just want it to be exactly

1233
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,480
Speaker 10:  the way they want it. And you know, wood Smith was like turned out to be

1234
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,800
Speaker 10:  the tool that helps 'em accomplish that.

1235
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:32,400
Speaker 2:  I am curious how you've like over the last three years I've even had trouble

1236
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,960
Speaker 2:  thinking about where information kind of lives on your phone.

1237
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:39,360
Speaker 2:  First it was just widgets and then it was lock screen widgets and then it

1238
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,960
Speaker 2:  was live activities and then it was the dynamic island. And we've gotten

1239
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,320
Speaker 2:  to this point where it's like how I define a widget gets more

1240
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,880
Speaker 2:  complicated over time and you've kind of tentacle out into some of those

1241
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,760
Speaker 2:  things too. Like do you have a really good sort of mental

1242
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:56,640
Speaker 2:  picture of how all of that stuff works and fits together

1243
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:57,560
Speaker 2:  and makes sense?

1244
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:01,560
Speaker 10:  Sure. I mean I think at, at its core widgets are about

1245
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:06,120
Speaker 10:  taking little bits of an app and exporting

1246
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:10,040
Speaker 10:  them outside of the app itself. Okay. And I think depending on

1247
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:14,400
Speaker 10:  what kind of experience you're trying to pull out of the app, those different

1248
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:18,200
Speaker 10:  locations, whether it's a home screen widget, a lock screen widget, whether

1249
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:21,400
Speaker 10:  it's a live activity or a live activity in the dynamic island, but what

1250
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:25,360
Speaker 10:  makes sense in each of those places is going to be very different. If it's

1251
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,960
Speaker 10:  something that is like just showing the temperature, for example is a great

1252
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,720
Speaker 10:  lock screen widget, it's something that's small, concise, useful,

1253
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:36,520
Speaker 10:  and very glanceable. It's not something that you need, you know, it's just,

1254
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:39,280
Speaker 10:  you just wanna know how hot it is outside in the same way that we put the

1255
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:43,160
Speaker 10:  time on our lock screen and we all got rid of our watches. And so

1256
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:46,120
Speaker 10:  like that kind of data was great on the lock screen. But I think home screen

1257
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:49,320
Speaker 10:  is, it gets into this, you start to get into a place where it's like, well,

1258
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:52,640
Speaker 10:  do I want a bit more? Can I, you know, have a lot more space I can be like,

1259
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,600
Speaker 10:  have a bit more there and is it allowing me to get the data that I want

1260
01:13:56,620 --> 01:14:00,360
Speaker 10:  out of an app without having to go into that app? Hmm. And then

1261
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:04,480
Speaker 10:  live activities and the dynamic island, it tends to be much more of the

1262
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:08,240
Speaker 10:  sense of is there data that is ac that is changing in a

1263
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:12,440
Speaker 10:  very real time way, which doesn't really lend itself to the

1264
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:16,360
Speaker 10:  other forms because of the performance limitations that Apple puts on

1265
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,000
Speaker 10:  the other types of widget, those widgets, you know, the home screen and

1266
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,520
Speaker 10:  lock screen widgets are static essentially. I mean there's interactivity

1267
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,920
Speaker 10:  we have this year, but fundamentally they are showing a snapshot of data

1268
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,080
Speaker 10:  and so it, if it's updating in real time, they are not the right place for

1269
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,840
Speaker 10:  that. And so instead Apple made this other place where you have these temporary

1270
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,920
Speaker 10:  experiences that are widgets that are given special permission to update

1271
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:39,400
Speaker 10:  very regularly. You know, you're updating a few times, you know, it's like

1272
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:43,120
Speaker 10:  every few seconds rather than every few minutes. And that I think is sort

1273
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,520
Speaker 10:  of generally the way that I think about these sort of this hierarchy of

1274
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,320
Speaker 10:  different widget experiences we have now that they, they sort of go

1275
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:53,280
Speaker 10:  from the small to the large and then from the kind of real

1276
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:57,160
Speaker 10:  time to the just sort of static and where you are on the sort of

1277
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,360
Speaker 10:  on those, on those axes determines which one of those widget types you're

1278
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:03,320
Speaker 10:  gonna be in. But there's definitely more and more places that were sort

1279
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:07,080
Speaker 10:  of our widgets are being put because they're catering to different needs

1280
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,440
Speaker 10:  or to different sort of user desires.

1281
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:12,760
Speaker 2:  That's really helpful perspective actually, because I will say as a, as a

1282
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,680
Speaker 2:  user who does not understand the sort of performance capabilities of

1283
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:20,160
Speaker 2:  each one, the distinction between kind of what's allowed to refresh constantly

1284
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,440
Speaker 2:  and what isn't never really made a lot of sense to me. And I think the, the

1285
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,600
Speaker 2:  thing that has been the hardest for me is to figure out the difference between

1286
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:30,840
Speaker 2:  like a very good home screen widget and let's say a live

1287
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,040
Speaker 2:  activity. Sure. Because to me those should, those should just be the same

1288
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,760
Speaker 2:  thing. And I get that they're not, and I get that there are sort of artificial

1289
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,400
Speaker 2:  reasons that they can't be, but the idea of having something that is

1290
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:44,480
Speaker 2:  like, why can't I run a, I don't know, FaceTime

1291
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:48,320
Speaker 2:  call from a widget on my home screen? Like that seems like a thing that

1292
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:51,040
Speaker 2:  maybe should exist in the world. I don't dunno if that's a good idea or not,

1293
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,440
Speaker 2:  but it, it's just interesting that there are those kind of artificial limitations

1294
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:58,160
Speaker 2:  put on each one to make that hierarchy. And when you understand it like that,

1295
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:01,680
Speaker 2:  that hierarchy does kind of make sense even though as a user I'm kind of

1296
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,600
Speaker 2:  like just, just like, let me, I just wanna be able to hit a thing and just

1297
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,760
Speaker 2:  say, update this. Like, like the thing you can do with your email inbox where

1298
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,600
Speaker 2:  you decide how often it pulls or just have it push whenever there's new stuff.

1299
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:14,920
Speaker 2:  Like I kind of want that in all my widgets too, even if it crushes my battery

1300
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:15,760
Speaker 2:  life. I dunno. Sure.

1301
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,200
Speaker 10:  And I mean I think, and this is an area that I think is very, it is been

1302
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:22,080
Speaker 10:  a fascinating sort of timeline with Apple because Widgets originally, the

1303
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,720
Speaker 10:  first version of widgets was the Today view screen that they added

1304
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:29,840
Speaker 10:  back in, I can't remember much older versions of, of iOS.

1305
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:33,640
Speaker 10:  And that was actually something more akin to a fully

1306
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:37,480
Speaker 10:  running app that was running, like when you looked at your Today

1307
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,560
Speaker 10:  view, that app was running and it could do all kinds of real time things

1308
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:43,320
Speaker 10:  and could be That's true, yeah. Much more lively and interactive and you

1309
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,920
Speaker 10:  could have buttons and you could do all these things, but it, in order to

1310
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,800
Speaker 10:  do that, apple had to like put it somewhere to the side so that it

1311
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,480
Speaker 10:  wasn't running all the time, that it was only running if you swiped over

1312
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:56,000
Speaker 10:  to, you know, to the left of your home screen. But that also meant that

1313
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,320
Speaker 10:  it wasn't nearly as useful because you had to go and find it in order to

1314
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,480
Speaker 10:  do it. And you know, the reason they did that is of course is you know,

1315
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,880
Speaker 10:  it's performance and battery that it's whenever, if you allow an app to

1316
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,560
Speaker 10:  run all the time, inevitably bad things are gonna happen in terms of there's

1317
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:13,400
Speaker 10:  security issues, there's battery life issues, there's, is it

1318
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,920
Speaker 10:  interacting with other, you know, other apps that are running on the, on

1319
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,880
Speaker 10:  your phone issues. And so I think very wisely in many ways what Apple instead

1320
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:23,320
Speaker 10:  did is they built the, you know, the standard widgets that you see are just

1321
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,360
Speaker 10:  a, they're a very clever snapshot, but almost just like a picture that my

1322
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,360
Speaker 10:  app will generate and send over to, to, to iOS

1323
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:35,000
Speaker 10:  and then iOS can show that that picture and it doesn't cost them anything.

1324
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,920
Speaker 10:  There's no performance hit, you know, I, I can display a widget on your

1325
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,640
Speaker 10:  home screen all day and it isn't costing you any more battery life than

1326
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:45,480
Speaker 10:  if you've just had a collection of apps app icons there. And I think that

1327
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:49,200
Speaker 10:  sort of is the cleverness that behind what they did, they've done by doing

1328
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,840
Speaker 10:  that. But yeah, it creates this weird tension between, it's like, well,

1329
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,560
Speaker 10:  why isn't it an app? Well it's like if we gave you what you want and let

1330
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:59,520
Speaker 10:  you run a full app inside of a widget, then your overall

1331
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,960
Speaker 10:  experience of your phone will be worse because inevitably it's going to

1332
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,760
Speaker 10:  be draining on your device in a way that isn't actually getting

1333
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:10,160
Speaker 10:  you, you now you're not getting enough utility to justify the battery drain

1334
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:13,120
Speaker 10:  and performance hit that you're getting. And so instead they're taking this

1335
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,440
Speaker 10:  very incremental approach and saying it's like, well we're gonna do this

1336
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,920
Speaker 10:  snapshot approach, you know, we're gonna do live activities where it's like

1337
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,440
Speaker 10:  they're special and time bound and they're live in a special place. And

1338
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:25,360
Speaker 10:  even there, the technology that they're using to do those is similarly

1339
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:29,520
Speaker 10:  based on snapshots and clever things that a live activity isn't a live app

1340
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,640
Speaker 10:  that's running all the time, it's just an app that's given permission to

1341
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,640
Speaker 10:  refresh itself very regularly.

1342
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:35,560
Speaker 2:  I see, okay.

1343
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:39,640
Speaker 10:  Rather than something that is actually like if a window into

1344
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:43,520
Speaker 10:  the application itself. And then similarly with interactivity, they did

1345
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,760
Speaker 10:  the same exact thing where instead they're just saying if a user pushes

1346
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:50,480
Speaker 10:  on a particular part of a widget, you get a, a guaranteed refresh

1347
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:54,040
Speaker 10:  instantly so you can respond to the user's

1348
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:57,280
Speaker 10:  interaction and it feels like you're interacting with an app, but actually

1349
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:00,440
Speaker 10:  you're, it's just a very special way to say, gimme the next snapshot, gimme

1350
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:04,280
Speaker 10:  the next snapshot. And as a result it's super performant because the last

1351
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:08,120
Speaker 10:  time you hit that button, the last time it generates that snapshot, it's

1352
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,360
Speaker 10:  done and all the work is done and it'll be go back to immediately using

1353
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:15,360
Speaker 10:  Zero Battery and impacting your, you know, your device at all from that

1354
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,840
Speaker 10:  point on goes immediately to zero. And so I think it's a very clever approach

1355
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:22,440
Speaker 10:  in that regard technically, and it's just a very, it means that there's

1356
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:25,760
Speaker 10:  these weird distinctions users have to sort of navigate, but overall it

1357
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,480
Speaker 10:  means that I think widgets can be used everywhere and the story wasn't Apple

1358
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:33,280
Speaker 10:  added widgets and then my battery was toast. Right. It's like Apple

1359
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:36,840
Speaker 10:  added widgets and it was great and they worked and it didn't have any negative

1360
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,480
Speaker 10:  impacts. It was only positive ones.

1361
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:41,840
Speaker 2:  That makes sense. So yeah. Is you've been goofing around with interactivity,

1362
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,840
Speaker 2:  I've been using some of the stuff you found in Widget Smith. What do you

1363
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:48,000
Speaker 2:  make of it so far? Like did they, does that balance feel right?

1364
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:51,680
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I mean I think the, the balance that've struck right now with interactivity

1365
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,440
Speaker 10:  I think is very, is very strong in the sense of it's,

1366
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:59,640
Speaker 10:  it's amazing what you can get done with just a, you know, getting

1367
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:03,440
Speaker 10:  a guaranteed refresh based on a user action. Like it is

1368
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,350
Speaker 10:  surprisingly powerful for what the interactions and the inter the experiences

1369
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:10,600
Speaker 10:  that you can build with that. You know, the WC keynote was just like checking

1370
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:13,680
Speaker 10:  an item off a to-do list, which seems a bit basic and it's like you can

1371
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,080
Speaker 10:  totally do that. It's like, or you can, you know, scroll through

1372
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:21,360
Speaker 10:  your calendar in, you know, sort of dynamically or look at a weather forecast

1373
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:24,240
Speaker 10:  and say, you know, it's an hourly forecast and you wanna see the next six

1374
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:28,000
Speaker 10:  hours after that, well you can tap and it'll slide over and they can

1375
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:31,360
Speaker 10:  do things there where they can make these rich. It can make the experience

1376
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:35,040
Speaker 10:  that much richer and creates that many fewer places and reasons why you

1377
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,320
Speaker 10:  have to actually get into the app in the first place. And I think that's

1378
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,320
Speaker 10:  what interactivity mostly is allowing at this point is that it reminds me

1379
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:45,000
Speaker 10:  a lot of watchOS apps where like a really good

1380
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:48,720
Speaker 10:  watchOS app is an app that it typically is something that you're only gonna

1381
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:52,160
Speaker 10:  experience for a few seconds. That it's, you're going in to get something

1382
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:55,640
Speaker 10:  and then coming out and it's not an app that you're expecting to just like

1383
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:59,400
Speaker 10:  be sitting tapping on your wrist for five minutes. It's something that you're

1384
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,920
Speaker 10:  gonna be in in seconds. And similarly I think Interactive Widgets allow

1385
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:06,760
Speaker 10:  you to have those same kinds of interactions on your home screen where

1386
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:10,080
Speaker 10:  rather than having to open the app to do something, maybe you can just,

1387
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:14,000
Speaker 10:  you know, tap two or three times on the widget to get to the exact date

1388
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,880
Speaker 10:  of view that you're interested in or the exact, you know, behavior you want

1389
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:20,120
Speaker 10:  and then you're done. And you never actually had to launch the app to do

1390
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,960
Speaker 10:  that. And so I think they've struck a really interesting balance. I think,

1391
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,440
Speaker 10:  I doubt this is the final form of it, like my suspicion is that there will

1392
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:30,200
Speaker 10:  be more things that will come over time as they've kind of

1393
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:33,840
Speaker 10:  explore how we, you know, how users respond to interactivity, but it feels

1394
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:37,600
Speaker 10:  like they've been taking this incrementally growing out the widgets story

1395
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:41,640
Speaker 10:  over the last, you know, since 2020 and it, I doubt they're done at this

1396
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:45,400
Speaker 10:  point. I think it's a, this seems like a very meaningful step forward to

1397
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:49,000
Speaker 10:  make them not just static things, but to have the user expectation of being

1398
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,760
Speaker 10:  able to interact with them in the first place.

1399
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:54,760
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. So yeah, I, I guess part of me is trying to figure out how

1400
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:58,720
Speaker 2:  far I want that to go because it's like a, the checkoff that to do list example's

1401
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:01,440
Speaker 2:  a good one, right? That's, that's an easy obvious thing that it's always

1402
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,960
Speaker 2:  been sort of ridiculous. You have to open an app for, but then it's like,

1403
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,920
Speaker 2:  okay, I want to edit a task. Should it open up a text

1404
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:11,520
Speaker 2:  box on top of the widget? That seems like probably not,

1405
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,880
Speaker 2:  I don't know. It's, it's there, there's finding out where that middle ground

1406
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:19,480
Speaker 2:  sort of eventually ought to be with all of this is really interesting. And

1407
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:23,320
Speaker 2:  I think that like refresh the snapshot thing makes me think that

1408
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:26,960
Speaker 2:  if that's the paradigm, it's always gonna be just kind of, you can do

1409
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:30,760
Speaker 2:  one thing at a time and this is not meant to be like a multi-step

1410
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:34,920
Speaker 2:  tool. It's a look at this thing and then look at this thing. Yes. And that

1411
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,200
Speaker 2:  that maybe that's enough.

1412
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:40,480
Speaker 10:  Yeah. And I think if we got further things, I think they would be in that

1413
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,280
Speaker 10:  same model. And it reminds me a bit of how in notifications when you get

1414
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:48,080
Speaker 10:  a notification and it's like you can respond to the, like someone sends

1415
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,760
Speaker 10:  you a text, you can respond to that text without opening the messages app

1416
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:55,680
Speaker 10:  in terms of you can respond inside the notification is a thing that they've

1417
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:59,120
Speaker 10:  allowed you to do for, for a while now. And I think I could imagine

1418
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:03,520
Speaker 10:  a similar thing in widgets where it's like you have the ability to,

1419
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:07,920
Speaker 10:  you know, prompt the user for text. And so if you wanted to

1420
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:11,720
Speaker 10:  have a to-do list app where you are able to add items directly from your

1421
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,560
Speaker 10:  home screen, it would be through some kind of, you know, system managed

1422
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,720
Speaker 10:  process where you would tap a button and the keyboard would pop up with

1423
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:21,280
Speaker 10:  a little text view, you type in whatever it is you want, you hit return

1424
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:25,520
Speaker 10:  that gets sent to the app and then it refle refreshes the

1425
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:29,320
Speaker 10:  widget. So you're not launching like the, the app is not,

1426
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:33,240
Speaker 10:  is only ever getting the text. It's not, I'm, I'm not responsible for the

1427
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:36,880
Speaker 10:  keyboard, it's not an interactive experience in the same way, but it's a

1428
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,280
Speaker 10:  way of kind of pushing that next step forward because I think anything they

1429
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,040
Speaker 10:  do is going to be through this kind of very regimented

1430
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:47,640
Speaker 10:  approach where your widgets are locked down in a way that is very performant

1431
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,480
Speaker 10:  and clever. But it's like if they added text entry in iOS 18, like

1432
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:55,120
Speaker 10:  that would seem like a very logical next step to do. And there's expands

1433
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:58,320
Speaker 10:  the range of activities that would be potentially useful that, you know,

1434
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,880
Speaker 10:  you could imagine a notes app or to do app or any kind of thing that you're

1435
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,760
Speaker 10:  collect regularly collecting little bits of information that seems great

1436
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,760
Speaker 10:  to not have to, to open an app in order to do that.

1437
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:11,720
Speaker 2:  Has interactivity opened up your brain on stuff you wanna

1438
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,520
Speaker 2:  put into Widgetsmith? I think most of the stuff I've seen so far is kind

1439
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,760
Speaker 2:  of extensions on the things you've already been doing. The one I've been

1440
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,160
Speaker 2:  using constantly is being able to scroll the hourly forecast. I love that.

1441
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:24,000
Speaker 2:  Sure. Like it's, it's one of those little things I didn't expect to like

1442
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,320
Speaker 2:  really care about, but it loves, it's, it's delightful. But are there things

1443
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:31,200
Speaker 2:  you've been either building or looking at that are sort of totally

1444
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:33,560
Speaker 2:  new and different because of interactivity? Sure.

1445
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,800
Speaker 10:  I mean, I think, I mean the, the, the most like silly example of that is

1446
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,200
Speaker 10:  like being able to put games into your widgets, which doesn't, it's like,

1447
01:24:40,230 --> 01:24:43,720
Speaker 10:  it's a, it is a complete silly thing in many ways, but like sometimes the

1448
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,800
Speaker 10:  silly things are the best things and like that's an example of something

1449
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,160
Speaker 10:  that just wasn't possible before. And now you can, and obviously there's

1450
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:52,200
Speaker 10:  limitations on a game 'cause it has to be a game that you can play only

1451
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:56,280
Speaker 10:  by sort of intermittent tapping that is not in a

1452
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,360
Speaker 10:  timely way. So like

1453
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,080
Speaker 2:  Tic-tac-toe in a widget would totally work.

1454
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:02,280
Speaker 10:  Yes, exactly. Okay. Like something in any kind of game where there's, you're

1455
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:06,040
Speaker 10:  taking turns or that kind of behavior is definitely something that's possible.

1456
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:10,120
Speaker 10:  But you know, you know, you're not gonna be able to make Flappy Bird for

1457
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:13,680
Speaker 10:  the widget because there's no sense of timeliness to the, the, you know,

1458
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:17,680
Speaker 10:  when you tap and how it responds. But I think that's a kind of thing that's,

1459
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,400
Speaker 10:  I don't think the game itself necessarily is the end state of that,

1460
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:24,600
Speaker 10:  but I think that's an example of the kind of thing that you can start to

1461
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:28,200
Speaker 10:  do where just having the ability to respond to a button tap

1462
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:31,240
Speaker 10:  opens up a variety of things that you could come up with and you could think

1463
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,240
Speaker 10:  of that allow you to do. And like, I mean, so I've done a bunch of things

1464
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:38,200
Speaker 10:  with, related to music. It was actually a widget that I found

1465
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:42,120
Speaker 10:  super helpful for me is I've made a little like a co cover flow widget.

1466
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:45,760
Speaker 10:  So, you know, so you can put, put your albums into a, a medium

1467
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:48,440
Speaker 10:  widget and you can, you know, sort of you tap on the edges and you can scroll

1468
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,840
Speaker 10:  through them and then you can tap on the one in the middle and it'll start

1469
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:54,400
Speaker 10:  to play. And because it's interactive, I don't, you don't have to launch

1470
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,400
Speaker 10:  the app for it to play, you know, it's, it's, it's not needing

1471
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,480
Speaker 10:  you to even do an app launch. It can just start. And then, because the now

1472
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,000
Speaker 10:  playing experience goes up into the, you know, the dynamic island, you just

1473
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:08,280
Speaker 10:  see that the album started playing and you can, you know, move on. And I

1474
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:12,040
Speaker 10:  think that kind of thing is just really just different

1475
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,640
Speaker 10:  that it, it feels very interesting to not even have to duck in and out of

1476
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:18,960
Speaker 10:  an app. Like previously if I'd done music widgets, like, well you have to

1477
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,040
Speaker 10:  launch Widgetsmith, it'll start to play and then you have to quit it because

1478
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:25,800
Speaker 10:  that you always had to have this weird round trip to the app even if the

1479
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,920
Speaker 10:  app was doing hardly anything, you know, or similarly you can start workouts

1480
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,720
Speaker 10:  is another thing with interactivity where you could, you know, you can say

1481
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,680
Speaker 10:  you're going for a run and you tap it and your phone just starts striking

1482
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:39,240
Speaker 10:  your run without having to open an app necessarily and you can just jump

1483
01:26:39,310 --> 01:26:43,280
Speaker 10:  into the, the live activity or the dynamic island and you

1484
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,920
Speaker 10:  can tap the widget and then you can lock your phone and then off you go

1485
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,840
Speaker 10:  and it's, your progress would show up on your home, you know, on your lock

1486
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,520
Speaker 10:  screen in the live activity. And it's not like that one step

1487
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:55,600
Speaker 10:  is huge, but I feel like taking the number of times that you can take out

1488
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,520
Speaker 10:  that one step will add up over time in terms of its value

1489
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,040
Speaker 10:  and utility.

1490
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:08,280
Speaker 2:  After David and I talked naturally, I put a thousand new widgets on my iPhone,

1491
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:12,400
Speaker 2:  but while I'm in the middle of this personalization craze, I started

1492
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:16,280
Speaker 2:  thinking about changing my wallpaper and my app icons too, both

1493
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:20,040
Speaker 2:  of which are also really good ways to personalize your phone and make it

1494
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:23,680
Speaker 2:  work the way that you want it to. I ended up buying a wallpaper from a guy

1495
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:27,640
Speaker 2:  named Isaac Mosna, who you might know as Kasie from YouTube and elsewhere

1496
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,160
Speaker 2:  on the internet

1497
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:31,920
Speaker 11:  Today I'll be showing you how I've set up my phone, some of the apps I use

1498
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:35,880
Speaker 11:  and generally how I've customized it to match my style and how I

1499
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:36,560
Speaker 11:  use my device.

1500
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,480
Speaker 2:  I like the wallpaper, it looks great, but it kind of made me wonder what

1501
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:44,080
Speaker 2:  is it like being in the iPhone personalization business?

1502
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:48,480
Speaker 2:  There are countless free iPhone wallpapers online, so how

1503
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:52,360
Speaker 2:  do you make some that people will pay for? What makes them pay for it and

1504
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:55,680
Speaker 2:  what makes a great wallpaper? Great. Anyway,

1505
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,280
Speaker 2:  so I called up Isaac and asked him, and I asked him just to start at the

1506
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:02,520
Speaker 2:  very beginning, how do you become a person who makes wallpapers?

1507
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:07,080
Speaker 12:  It was kind of for myself originally, because I'm making YouTube videos,

1508
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,520
Speaker 12:  I can never find the, the wallpaper I wanted to like showcase any YouTube

1509
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,680
Speaker 12:  video because you don't

1510
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,560
Speaker 2:  Wanna just have the same like stock wallpapers everybody has, right?

1511
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:17,400
Speaker 12:  No, no, I, I couldn't do that. I'm like, I used to do that. But then like

1512
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,920
Speaker 12:  making videos, everybody has like a really nice vibrant eye catching

1513
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:24,720
Speaker 12:  wallpaper in the thumbnail and I used like a lot of

1514
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,160
Speaker 12:  'em and then I just kinda got sick of hunting and searching and being like,

1515
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,920
Speaker 12:  okay, this is okay. But like, I wish it was a bit more orange or a bit more

1516
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:35,640
Speaker 12:  blue because the thumbnail idea I have doesn't really work or you know,

1517
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:39,320
Speaker 12:  in the video it doesn't really match the, the scheme of like my set

1518
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,120
Speaker 12:  design. So I'm like, what if I just made them? And it was during Covid

1519
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:46,800
Speaker 12:  so I had so much time, like I was home and I'm like, I'm gonna get my iPad

1520
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,200
Speaker 12:  out, I'm gonna start drawing, I'm gonna start making some wallpapers. And

1521
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:54,080
Speaker 12:  I thought I was pretty happy with my original designs and I thought that

1522
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:58,040
Speaker 12:  they looked, they looked great and matched my style of like minimal designs

1523
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:01,810
Speaker 12:  and matched sort of my thumbnail style and my video style. It was all a

1524
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:05,760
Speaker 12:  nice cohesive experience. You know, being a YouTube video, people

1525
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,560
Speaker 12:  would ask immediately like, where'd you get your wallpaper from? It's the

1526
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,520
Speaker 12:  most common question in any tech video on a phone or a tablet or a laptop.

1527
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:16,480
Speaker 12:  It's like, where's the wallpaper from? For me, I, I just made them all.

1528
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:20,560
Speaker 12:  So eventually I was able to launch a Shopify store with my zero

1529
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:24,160
Speaker 12:  knowledge of web design. Nice. I was able to figure it out and

1530
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:28,160
Speaker 12:  Shopify makes it really easy to do all that stuff. And you know, Shopify

1531
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:31,800
Speaker 12:  makes the whole sales process very easy too. Yeah. Lets me sell

1532
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:35,480
Speaker 12:  to whoever I want. There's apps to have digital downloads,

1533
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:39,960
Speaker 12:  all that fun stuff. And next thing you know, I'm dropping a wallpaper

1534
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:43,720
Speaker 12:  pack every few weeks and wallpaper packs for me just consist of

1535
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:47,400
Speaker 12:  different designs that kind of go together in a specific theme.

1536
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:51,120
Speaker 12:  I like to have fun with it. I like to like think of really cool names for

1537
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,240
Speaker 12:  all the wallpaper names for all the different wallpapers in a pack have

1538
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:58,000
Speaker 12:  like a very themed design for like the mockup photos.

1539
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:01,840
Speaker 12:  Pretty much every pack would have like new photos with little quirks and

1540
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,680
Speaker 12:  little fun things here and there and I didn't really know

1541
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:10,080
Speaker 12:  how well it would do, but then it just started blowing up.

1542
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:13,880
Speaker 12:  Like it was just nonstop. It almost became a full business. I almost had

1543
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,800
Speaker 12:  to hire somebody to manage like customer service. Wow. And manage

1544
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:21,320
Speaker 12:  hosting the website. I'm thankful that I, I had just finished

1545
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,960
Speaker 12:  university so I was like ready to go. I was ready to work and my whole focus

1546
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:29,920
Speaker 12:  was dedicated to YouTube, Instagram, other content production and, and now

1547
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:31,640
Speaker 12:  my website with these wallpaper.

1548
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:35,560
Speaker 2:  Why do you think it worked so well? I mean, wallpapers are a funny thing

1549
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:39,200
Speaker 2:  in that there are a billion of them out there, right? Like if you just google

1550
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:43,000
Speaker 2:  like iPhone wallpaper, like you can, you can look through the options until

1551
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Speaker 2:  the day you die and you'll never run out. Like I wonder if there is something

1552
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,680
Speaker 2:  to just like, you have a style that fits and people just like understand

1553
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:53,200
Speaker 2:  your style and like your style and that goes a long way. I don't know like

1554
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,480
Speaker 2:  why do you think it took off the way it did?

1555
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:58,320
Speaker 12:  It's a mix of different things. It's a mix of people seeing the wallpaper

1556
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:01,960
Speaker 12:  in action on my channel. People who know my style, they know

1557
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:06,280
Speaker 12:  I like these sort of designs. People seeing it in use, it's great. I think

1558
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:10,080
Speaker 12:  also Apple's customization push was also a good thing. It came at the right

1559
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:14,160
Speaker 12:  time. People like to make their phone personal and

1560
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:18,320
Speaker 12:  they like to make it something that is uniquely them because one thing that

1561
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:22,160
Speaker 12:  I also envision too, or I at least thought of when designing these is like,

1562
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:26,160
Speaker 12:  we don't really hang that many things up in our homes anymore, like art

1563
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:30,000
Speaker 12:  or designs. But our phone is like a canvas that we see

1564
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:34,120
Speaker 12:  every single day. It's like we turn it on, we see a wallpaper or a new

1565
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:37,840
Speaker 12:  wallpaper that cycles. And to be able to see like a little bit of art

1566
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:41,640
Speaker 12:  or a nice design, it has the same effect as art in your home. Whether

1567
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:45,360
Speaker 12:  when you come home and you see it, you have like this nice feeling of

1568
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:49,720
Speaker 12:  this is familiar or this makes me feel a certain way. If something is dynamic

1569
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:53,320
Speaker 12:  and bold and bright, it kinda like wakes you up a little bit. It makes you

1570
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:56,840
Speaker 12:  feel a bit more energetic. And obviously I'm just talking about a image

1571
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:01,240
Speaker 12:  or a jpeg, but it's like it, it does have that feeling whenever

1572
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:05,200
Speaker 12:  I turn my phone on, like I get hit with like a bold, textured,

1573
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:09,080
Speaker 12:  vibrant piece and makes me happy. So it's a mix of different

1574
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:09,240
Speaker 12:  things.

1575
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:12,400
Speaker 2:  No, I, I think, I think you're totally right. So take me through the process

1576
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,800
Speaker 2:  a little bit. Like you, you sit down and you're like, okay, I want to, I

1577
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,400
Speaker 2:  want to do a new pack, a new collection. Where do you start?

1578
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:22,720
Speaker 12:  So pretty much I like to start with colors. I think colors

1579
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:26,280
Speaker 12:  are the best place to start for me personally and the way I work. Let's

1580
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:29,760
Speaker 12:  say I wanna do like a very cool toned palette, maybe it's like a purple

1581
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:33,640
Speaker 12:  and a pink and a blue. I start to just mess with things I usually use per

1582
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:37,160
Speaker 12:  crate. I've done some stuff in illustrators and stuff in Photoshop, but

1583
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:41,040
Speaker 12:  usually procreate is the most consistent best way I work. I know

1584
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:44,400
Speaker 12:  how it works to a T now I know how all the brushes work, how everything

1585
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:48,200
Speaker 12:  kind of flows. And I think Procreate is so great because it's

1586
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,840
Speaker 12:  very natural and organic versus a computer you're like typing and you're

1587
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:55,520
Speaker 12:  clicking things. It's not as natural as like a pen or your finger.

1588
01:32:56,180 --> 01:33:00,080
Speaker 12:  So I'll start by like mixing around different colors and trying different

1589
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:03,960
Speaker 12:  gradients or trying different shapes. And then usually

1590
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:06,960
Speaker 12:  I'm able to just think of the pack right there. Like let's say it's like

1591
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:10,920
Speaker 12:  a two D shape based pack. I start drawing some flowing shapes, I start adding

1592
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:14,600
Speaker 12:  different colors, you know, things aren't really in the right place. I tweak

1593
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:18,120
Speaker 12:  them a little bit. Maybe I'll warp a shape a little bit until I really get

1594
01:33:18,230 --> 01:33:22,160
Speaker 12:  that exact shape and form I want. If it's a more abstract, like

1595
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:26,120
Speaker 12:  gradient based or like a really flowing designed pack, I'll just

1596
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:29,440
Speaker 12:  mess with it until I think it looks right and I think it has like the feeling

1597
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,360
Speaker 12:  I want. Then I do things like add a little bit of noise, add a bit of sharpness

1598
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:37,120
Speaker 12:  to things, tweak the colors a little bit, and then I throw them onto most

1599
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,520
Speaker 12:  of my devices to test them out. So I have it on my phone. Looks good. Okay,

1600
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:43,960
Speaker 12:  that's, that's solid. Put it on the desktop. I don't really know how that

1601
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:46,480
Speaker 12:  looks on the desktop. Maybe I have to tweak this one area a little bit.

1602
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:49,760
Speaker 12:  Maybe I have to blow this part up a little bit. Pull it back on the iPad,

1603
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:54,000
Speaker 12:  tweak that, send it to the desktop, try it on the iPad as well. And

1604
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,160
Speaker 12:  then once it's all shit, once it's all like in a, in a state that I like,

1605
01:33:57,620 --> 01:34:01,560
Speaker 12:  I'm ready to ship it onto my website. I do all the mockup photos, I shoot

1606
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,200
Speaker 12:  everything, you know, name everything as well based on how I feel, what

1607
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:09,160
Speaker 12:  the pack conveys in terms of the overall collection name

1608
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:13,120
Speaker 12:  and all the different names of all the different pieces. And then load it

1609
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:16,080
Speaker 12:  all up, write a nice little description and then that's it.

1610
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:19,400
Speaker 2:  So talk to me about the icon pack before I forget to ask about the icon pack.

1611
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:23,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I find icons so fascinating because yeah, like

1612
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:27,120
Speaker 2:  you only have one wallpaper, there are a million apps out there

1613
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:31,160
Speaker 2:  in the world. So I would think trying to make an icon pack that like is both

1614
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:34,920
Speaker 2:  sort of cohesive and looks nice, but also like exists

1615
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:38,320
Speaker 2:  in a world where everybody has a mountain of different apps on their phone.

1616
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:42,440
Speaker 2:  Strikes me as very hard. So like, what made you wanna do this in the first

1617
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:45,000
Speaker 2:  place? Like you just saw everybody customizing and you're like, I wanna,

1618
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,320
Speaker 2:  I want to see how I can be part of this too

1619
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:51,240
Speaker 12:  In some regards. But also like when I started designing the wallpapers,

1620
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:55,560
Speaker 12:  I felt like from my phone personally, the icons, like icons are all

1621
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,600
Speaker 12:  over the place these days. You know, there's like, like so many different

1622
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,120
Speaker 12:  colors. Some of them are all black, some of them are all white. And I just

1623
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,560
Speaker 12:  couldn't really think of a way to make it look cohesive. So I'll have the

1624
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:08,400
Speaker 12:  wallpaper that I'm really happy with, but then I'm like, okay. But the icons

1625
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,400
Speaker 12:  are just, they kind of mess with the color scheme. And you know, I like

1626
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,960
Speaker 12:  to keep things simple. Usually I like to keep things pretty minimal with

1627
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:17,920
Speaker 12:  design. So I just wanted to have like a set that is, you

1628
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,600
Speaker 12:  can either choose just, you can choose all black or all white and

1629
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:25,920
Speaker 12:  that's it. So with the, with my icon pack, like it's obviously a

1630
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:29,800
Speaker 12:  very specific taste. Like I hand drew every single icon. I

1631
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,960
Speaker 12:  don't remember exactly how icons, how many icons there are at this point.

1632
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:33,560
Speaker 12:  That's

1633
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:34,840
Speaker 2:  So many icons.

1634
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:38,640
Speaker 12:  I know I just, it was all like stock apps and then also a bunch of the popular

1635
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:42,240
Speaker 12:  apps that people use every single day. And I just wanted to make something

1636
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:46,040
Speaker 12:  that was very different than what everybody else did. 'cause I think a lot

1637
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:49,880
Speaker 12:  of people just shipped literally the same icons and

1638
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:53,520
Speaker 12:  like different, different packs. Like everybody was dropping contacts and

1639
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,840
Speaker 12:  a lot of them were just the same icons. And I just thought like what?

1640
01:35:56,930 --> 01:36:00,560
Speaker 2:  There was so much like very basic like clip art looking

1641
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:02,560
Speaker 2:  stuff in all those icon packs. Yes. Yeah.

1642
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:06,240
Speaker 12:  And the reason why is because it was the easiest way to make a lot of money.

1643
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:09,880
Speaker 12:  Like there was all these stories about some developer making a hundred thousand

1644
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:13,640
Speaker 12:  in a month off of a minimal icon pack and everybody wants to make a hundred

1645
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,720
Speaker 12:  thousand in a month. Yeah. But it's like, I can't do stuff like that. Like

1646
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,920
Speaker 12:  I just couldn't just ship out a random pack and then use my channels to

1647
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:24,680
Speaker 12:  promote it. 'cause I would feel bad. And also like I probably wouldn't have

1648
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:28,280
Speaker 12:  designed all of those icons, like where are they coming from? But obviously

1649
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:31,680
Speaker 12:  I don't mean to trash talk that designer. I think he was one of the first

1650
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:35,600
Speaker 12:  people to see the potential of custom icons. And I think he did it all

1651
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:38,680
Speaker 12:  by himself, which is great. I love that. I love seeing successes like that.

1652
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:42,000
Speaker 12:  Yeah. So for my collection, I want to have things that would fit my style,

1653
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:44,760
Speaker 12:  be a little bit unique, be a little bit different. It's not obviously for

1654
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,120
Speaker 12:  everyone, but the people who do like it are always sharing

1655
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:52,240
Speaker 12:  screenshots on Twitter or Instagram. Tell me how much they like it and

1656
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:56,080
Speaker 12:  request icons that they want to add. And obviously I can't do every single

1657
01:36:56,310 --> 01:37:00,200
Speaker 12:  icon. I'm not physically capable of doing that, but I

1658
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:03,400
Speaker 12:  like to be able to have icons for most of the popular apps and all the stock

1659
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,920
Speaker 12:  apps. And now with the new iPhones that have dynamic

1660
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:10,840
Speaker 12:  islands, it hides that really annoying shortcut notification

1661
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:14,680
Speaker 12:  that drops down every single time you open a shortcut, as I'm sure you're

1662
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:18,520
Speaker 12:  familiar with. That's one of the biggest things that prevented me from even

1663
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:22,200
Speaker 12:  doing this in the first place. Like even wanting to use icons. 'cause when

1664
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:26,520
Speaker 12:  you know this ability first came out, it was okay. Like it was

1665
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:29,280
Speaker 12:  like, you know that dropdown, you forget it's there. You get used to it.

1666
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:33,280
Speaker 12:  Either decide do I wanna see that notification every single time or

1667
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:37,320
Speaker 12:  do I have a nice beautiful custom home screen? And obviously a

1668
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:40,880
Speaker 12:  lot of people have chosen the ladder because it's worth the trade-off to

1669
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:44,560
Speaker 12:  sometimes have that customization in place. But now with the new dynamic

1670
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,280
Speaker 12:  island functionality, you don't see that notification at all. It hides it.

1671
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:52,040
Speaker 12:  In the island, it's very, very subtle. And now even with things like the

1672
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:55,560
Speaker 12:  camera before, if you used a shortcut with a custom

1673
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:59,680
Speaker 12:  icon to open up the camera app, it would take an extra full second for

1674
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:03,040
Speaker 12:  the camera. Oh geez. To like be ready to go canceled dealbreaker. I can't

1675
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:06,880
Speaker 12:  deal deal with that. But now you can do it. And if you're willing

1676
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,360
Speaker 12:  to go through the process, which isn't super terrible these days and there

1677
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:14,320
Speaker 12:  are very cohesive guides and I think even shortcuts you can download.

1678
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:18,400
Speaker 12:  It's pretty easy to do. But for me personally, my home screen is very clean

1679
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:22,400
Speaker 12:  and I like to have just a couple icons. Everything else is in the app

1680
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,480
Speaker 12:  library and that's how I like it. So

1681
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,840
Speaker 2:  I like that. Are you just a one home screen guy?

1682
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:28,360
Speaker 12:  Yeah, yeah. I have. I

1683
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,160
Speaker 2:  Admire that. I aspire to be that. It's

1684
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:33,560
Speaker 12:  All that works for me at this point. I like to have four apps in the doc

1685
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:36,960
Speaker 12:  and then four apps on my home screen. A little square

1686
01:38:37,070 --> 01:38:40,520
Speaker 12:  arrangement using the Clear Spaces app. 'cause I don't really wanna see

1687
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:43,280
Speaker 12:  too much when I turn my phone on. I want to be able to see my wallpaper

1688
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:47,120
Speaker 12:  and also be able to just see the core apps I need and any distracting things

1689
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:51,000
Speaker 12:  like Instagram and Twitter. All those are on in the app library,

1690
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:53,560
Speaker 12:  so they're not like the first thing I see when I turn my phone on.

1691
01:38:58,370 --> 01:39:02,360
Speaker 2:  After I talked to Isaac, I blew up my whole phone again. I got rid of a bunch

1692
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:06,040
Speaker 2:  of the widgets, I changed my wallpaper again and I changed a few icons.

1693
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:10,200
Speaker 2:  I didn't change all of my icons, just the four in my doc,

1694
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:14,040
Speaker 2:  which tend to be the ones that never really move around and they're all a

1695
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:17,600
Speaker 2:  single style now. I really like how it looks. Plus I now have just two home

1696
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,280
Speaker 2:  screens. One is apps and one is widgets. And I think Isaac's right that

1697
01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:24,720
Speaker 2:  less is more there. The app library or the app drawer on Android

1698
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:25,880
Speaker 2:  do the job. Great.

1699
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:31,520
Speaker 2:  After all this, suffice to say my phone looks really different than it did

1700
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,280
Speaker 2:  a few weeks ago and it was a really fun exercise actually. I wound up not

1701
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:39,040
Speaker 2:  just changing the look of my phone, but really thinking about where I want

1702
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:42,880
Speaker 2:  things to be and what I want to have easy access to and maybe just as

1703
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:46,840
Speaker 2:  important what I don't wanna have easy access to, plus what my home

1704
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:50,520
Speaker 2:  screen and wallpaper and icons and widgets should not just

1705
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:54,200
Speaker 2:  do, but make me feel every time I turn my phone on.

1706
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:58,520
Speaker 2:  Not everyone is gonna want to go down this unbelievable rabbit hole of

1707
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:01,440
Speaker 2:  personalization and shortcuts and widgets and all kinds of different stuff

1708
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:05,240
Speaker 2:  and that's okay. But I think it's worth at least spending a few minutes to

1709
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:08,120
Speaker 2:  make sure that when you turn your phone on, as we all do a million times

1710
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:11,720
Speaker 2:  a day, it feels the way you want it to because I think that's important.

1711
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:18,600
Speaker 2:  Alright, that's enough Apple talk. That is it for The Vergecast today. Thanks
