Title: Giles Martin and Sonos CEO Patrick Spence on the new Era 100 and Era 300 speakers

Description: Today, Sonos announced a new line of speakers — the Era 100 and the Era 300 — with the latter finally taking on this format that has been a hit-or-miss experience for music lovers, supporting Amazon Music and Apple Music’s spatial audio. Though spatial format Dolby Atmos has been supported on the Sonos Arc soundbar, the Era 300 signals a music-first approach to its speakers supporting 3D soundscapes. Sonos CEO Patrick Spence believes this is the right time to do it. “We didn’t know that, in 2022, 85 of the top Billboard 100 artists would actually release Atmos tracks, but they did,” Spence says. “We feel like we’re at an inflection point.”
On board with Sonos for this shift in music listening is record producer Giles Martin, who mixed the first-ever spatial audio album (a remix of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Beatles album that his father, George Martin, originally produced) and several albums and live experiences in Dolby Atmos since. Martin is also the senior vice president of sound experience at Sonos and was involved in the development of the speaker. “When you’re building a product which has multi sort of use and orientations, you do prioritize ... in a way of, what’s the wow factor?” Martin explains. “The wow factor, which I think is truly extraordinary out of the 300, is the fact that it does spatial out of a single box. And it’s really compelling.”
Both Patrick and Giles joined Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel for The Vergecast to talk about the new speakers, supporting spatial audio, and why this is the time to do it.

00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,520
Speaker 2:  Hello and welcome to the the flagship podcast of

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,240
Speaker 2:  Guitar Players Sneaking Up Behind you Spatial audio. I'm your Fred

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,560
Speaker 2:  Eli. Chris Welchs here. Hey Chris.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,520
Speaker 3:  Hello. It's good to be here. The day has finally come. Eli,

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,480
Speaker 2:  The day has finally come. Chris, you have scooped this day many, many

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,040
Speaker 2:  times leading up to this moment. We're publishing our usual Wednesday episode

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,240
Speaker 2:  one day early on a Tuesday because today on the show I spent some time

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,080
Speaker 2:  with Sonos CEO Patrick Spence and Sonos senior Vice President of

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,960
Speaker 2:  Sound Experience, Gil Martin, who's also a very famous record producer. I

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,960
Speaker 2:  just wanna put that out there. I could have talked to Giles about just making

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,840
Speaker 2:  records for the entire show, but like Chris said, the day is finally

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,600
Speaker 2:  here. Sonos has announced the new era, 100 and

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,920
Speaker 2:  300 speakers, which if you've been following the Vergecast or following the

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,800
Speaker 2:  Verge following Chris, you know Chris has been inside the air ducts at Sonos

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,800
Speaker 2:  for months. Just banana camming

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,280
Speaker 2:  these speakers.

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,440
Speaker 3:  Yes, yes. First there were renders, then there were photos, and now the whole

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,440
Speaker 3:  thing is finally unveiled for everybody.

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,160
Speaker 2:  I will say, by the way, just to put, these, were not planted leaks, I don't

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,000
Speaker 2:  think Sonos was pleased with Chris, but very gracious Chris, I

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,840
Speaker 2:  believe Patrick said you're just doing your job, which is true. Exactly.

23
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,720
Speaker 2:  But they know that we love audio products. They know that we love social

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,480
Speaker 2:  products. They were, they're very gracious and, and still came on the show

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,000
Speaker 2:  to talk to us before Patrick and Drs came on the show.

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,000
Speaker 2:  Chris and I got a chance to go listen to these speakers to hear from the

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,960
Speaker 2:  designers and product managers. Let's start with the 100 quickly, Chris.

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,640
Speaker 2:  I think it sounds great. It's just a regular stereo speaker though.

29
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,680
Speaker 3:  Oh yeah, it's now stereo ish I guess since there's just one woofer, but

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,040
Speaker 3:  the Sonos one was just mono, so this just, this definitely does sound quite

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,080
Speaker 3:  better from the test that they ran for us. But it looks similar. It's like

32
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,800
Speaker 3:  barely bigger in size, but it has Bluetooth and line in now, which the

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,240
Speaker 3:  Sonos one did not. So you've got a lot more options for playing stuff in

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,640
Speaker 3:  your turntable or if somebody comes over and wants to play something in your

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,000
Speaker 3:  in your house, that's a bit easier with Bluetooth. So that's a big deal I

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,920
Speaker 3:  think. And it's 2 49, which is not much more than the Sonos one was. So

37
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,560
Speaker 3:  I think it's gonna do pretty well. How about you?

38
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,200
Speaker 2:  I thought it sounded great. I think we've caveat this every time we talk

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,440
Speaker 2:  about speakers, we listen to in demo environments, we listen to it in their

40
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,360
Speaker 2:  demo environment, right? If it sounded anything but great, it would've been

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,680
Speaker 2:  a story. It sounded great in the demo environment, it is a little bit taller.

42
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,840
Speaker 2:  I think the line in is really useful. I think a lot of people are gonna plug

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,520
Speaker 2:  record players into this, which Sun knows a lot of people are doing. But

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,080
Speaker 2:  it is an incremental improvement over the Sonos one. The thing that stands

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,600
Speaker 2:  out honestly over the Sonos one is that it no longer has Google

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,480
Speaker 2:  assistant support and Sonos says that is down to a change on Google's end.

47
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,040
Speaker 2:  I think that might be down to the fact that Sonos and Google are suing each

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,320
Speaker 2:  other over patents. Yes,

49
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,360
Speaker 3:  The timing does leave some kind of room for interpretation. It

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,760
Speaker 2:  Does. So the Sonos one had Google assistant support. I use Google Assistant

51
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,720
Speaker 2:  on my Sonos devices and with my Google devices. I think

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,600
Speaker 2:  I'm the only person in the entire ecosystem that has a reasonably good

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,960
Speaker 2:  experience doing that anyway. Like Tom Warren is always like, this sucks.

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,880
Speaker 2:  Like what does anybody do this? That's it. Like in terms of notable changes,

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Speaker 2:  yep, it's got stereo tweeters now it's a little bit taller. It's got Linein

56
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,560
Speaker 2:  and Bluetooth, which is great. But kind of the big omission, the big trade-off

57
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,480
Speaker 2:  is you normally get Google support, which I might be the only person that

58
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:11,840
Speaker 2:  cares about,

59
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,520
Speaker 3:  Hey, they seem pretty confident with the combo of the Sonos voice control

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,640
Speaker 3:  that, and Alexa, I think Sonos voice control just added timers. So

61
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,720
Speaker 3:  there you go. It's slowly doing more than just music functions. Yeah, but

62
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,800
Speaker 3:  I think those two, they should cover a lot of ground, but I'm sure some people

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,120
Speaker 3:  will miss Google a system if that's what they're paid into and bought into.

64
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,800
Speaker 2:  So that's the Sonos era 100, which is very nice product. Santa Great the

65
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,560
Speaker 2:  demo room, but pretty incremental upgrade over the Sonos one.

66
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,640
Speaker 2:  The Sonos era 300 is a radically different

67
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,320
Speaker 2:  beast. A much more important product I think in this entire category.

68
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,120
Speaker 2:  The first real standalone

69
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,440
Speaker 2:  multi-service spatial audio device that I can think of, there's the

70
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,720
Speaker 2:  HomePod, but that only does spatial with Apple Music. There's the

71
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,560
Speaker 2:  Amazon Echo Studio, which only does spatial music with

72
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,440
Speaker 2:  Amazon service. This supports them both. It will support more services

73
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,880
Speaker 2:  over time. One imagines and it's spatial audio in a box. What's going on

74
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,080
Speaker 2:  with the air? The Air 300, Chris.

75
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,120
Speaker 3:  So it was built from the ground up for spatial audio. They said it started

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,080
Speaker 3:  three years ago with a project and the shape and design people have had

77
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,960
Speaker 3:  some opinions on. We published the photos of them on our site and,

78
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,800
Speaker 3:  and I saw one thread on Reddit where someone was like, I've been a lifelong

79
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,320
Speaker 3:  Zs fan. This is the ugliest speaker I've ever seen in my life. But I will

80
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,120
Speaker 3:  say it plays better in person than it does in like photos. It looks bigger

81
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,400
Speaker 3:  somehow in photos than it does in person. It's actually not that large at

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,560
Speaker 3:  all. But yeah, it's been built from the ground up for spatial. There are

83
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,040
Speaker 3:  six drivers in there. And yeah, Sonos thinks that you really can't do real

84
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,240
Speaker 3:  s spatial audio with like a round speaker, like the home pod that just fires

85
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,960
Speaker 3:  in all directions. Gil said you have to have some kind of like front facing

86
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,600
Speaker 3:  speaker or driver in there as well.

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah, and you will hear in this interview, Giles and I went

88
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,240
Speaker 2:  at each other about special audio and whether it's good or not, I think

89
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
Speaker 2:  I have space to go. I think. I think he's correct. When it's really good,

90
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,840
Speaker 2:  it's really good. And I think the industry is position is like,

91
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,160
Speaker 2:  it should all be like this. And I, somewhere in the middle is like, what

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
Speaker 2:  is a good spatial mix? And the answer is that it's much more restrained than

93
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,480
Speaker 2:  what we're hearing from a lot of things right now. And that that to me is,

94
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,080
Speaker 2:  it's the big question mark with this entire approach. But like I said

95
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,120
Speaker 2:  in the room, the Air 300 sounded great. And I'm curious

96
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,760
Speaker 2:  what it sounds like in lots of other kinds of rooms that are not small boxes

97
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,720
Speaker 2:  with perfect walls. Other little notes before we drop into the

98
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,880
Speaker 2:  interview, Chris, you also got a chance to spend some time talking to Patrick.

99
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,720
Speaker 2:  What'd you learn from that conversation?

100
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,120
Speaker 3:  We talked about Bluetooth and line in, because Sonos used to make fun of

101
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,760
Speaker 3:  Bluetooth. Actually. They had ads where like the music would be like interrupted

102
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,160
Speaker 3:  by phone calls and texts and stuff like that. Patrick was like, well, it's

103
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,840
Speaker 3:  gotten better now. It's more liable. And that combined with line in, they

104
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,440
Speaker 3:  just wanna give people more choice. And that also like adds to the long term

105
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,720
Speaker 3:  future proofing of these products because they had that S one and S two controversy.

106
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,560
Speaker 3:  So they're saying these, these speakers and Pest, I think the play one and

107
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,520
Speaker 3:  Play Five still have years and the years and the years of of life left in

108
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,400
Speaker 3:  them. So that's a relief for customers, I'm sure. Yeah, there should be more

109
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,360
Speaker 3:  in the site as these products launch and more photos and all, all kinds

110
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,720
Speaker 3:  of goodness.

111
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,440
Speaker 2:  Yeah, we've got full coverage of the launch on the site. As you listen to

112
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,040
Speaker 2:  this, if you want look at pictures or read more hands-on impressions for

113
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,280
Speaker 2:  now though, we should jump into the conversation here is

114
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,400
Speaker 2:  Sonos CEO Patrick Spence and Senior Vice President of Sound Experience. And

115
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,320
Speaker 2:  I should note extremely famous record producer Charles Martin

116
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,280
Speaker 2:  Patrick Spence, you're the CEO of Sonos. Charles Martin. You're the senior

117
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,920
Speaker 2:  Vice President of Sound Experience in Sonos. Yeah, it's a short title. Yeah,

118
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,440
Speaker 2:  it doesn't, it means everything. And perhaps nothing we're gonna find out.

119
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,920
Speaker 2:  Well, welcome to the show. You guys have new products, big

120
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,120
Speaker 2:  new products for Sonos, big set forward in spatial audio. I wanna talk about

121
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,520
Speaker 2:  all of that. Patrick, let's start with the products themselves. Two new speakers,

122
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,560
Speaker 2:  ERA 100, ERA 300. What are they? What do we need to

123
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,400
Speaker 4:  Know? Yeah, I mean this is really the next generation of Sonos, so

124
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,360
Speaker 4:  we're doing something very unique for us. You and I in the past have talked

125
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,040
Speaker 4:  about all the changes we made to bring out at least two new products every

126
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,800
Speaker 4:  single year. We've never brought out two products at the same time,

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,760
Speaker 4:  and they're from the same family. And we really feel like with ERA 300,

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,760
Speaker 4:  we've set the standard for out loud spatial

129
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,640
Speaker 4:  audio listening. And this is something the team's been working on for three

130
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,560
Speaker 4:  years, toiling away, you know, and, and kind of the industry's been developing

131
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,640
Speaker 4:  along the way to have the content we need to actually bring it all to life.

132
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,840
Speaker 4:  And it's hitting at the perfect time. And then with ERA 100, we've really

133
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,320
Speaker 4:  taken our iconic Sonos One and

134
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,080
Speaker 4:  done what I'm very proud of, which is rethink it completely

135
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,480
Speaker 4:  new hardware, new software, all of it to create something that sounds

136
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,880
Speaker 4:  significantly better and really matches the kind of visual

137
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,320
Speaker 4:  ID you would expect oto, Sonos in this day and age. And so it is a new era.

138
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,240
Speaker 4:  We're signaling that with the names of the products as well. We're very excited

139
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,760
Speaker 4:  for customers to be able to experience them.

140
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,640
Speaker 2:  I really wanna talk a lot about the ERA 300 and with spatial audio,

141
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,920
Speaker 2:  which is potentially revolutionized in the music industry in a variety of

142
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,840
Speaker 2:  ways. But let's start with the ERA 100. I think we can kind of

143
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,440
Speaker 2:  understand this product fairly quickly. It sounds great. I listened to it

144
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,160
Speaker 2:  with trials earlier today. It's a full on replacement for the

145
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,560
Speaker 2:  SOS one as you're saying. Yes. What was the decision for you like to say,

146
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,800
Speaker 2:  okay, this is a product that people like, we saw a lot of them, we're gonna

147
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,080
Speaker 2:  just move on. Yeah, you

148
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,520
Speaker 4:  Know, it's, it is, the thinking is really, if you're not cannibalizing

149
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,880
Speaker 4:  yourself and trying to raise the bar on yourself, then you're not pushing

150
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,760
Speaker 4:  hard enough. And we, we have these debates all the time in terms of what

151
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,320
Speaker 4:  we're trying to do and are we pushing hard enough? And

152
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,840
Speaker 4:  it comes a time, you know, seven years that we had the Sonos one out where,

153
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,960
Speaker 4:  you know, kind of you get to itchy at that five, six year mark where you're

154
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,880
Speaker 4:  saying, okay, can we do something much better than this? And Giles and

155
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,840
Speaker 4:  the team and Chris Davey's on the audio side and then our design team are

156
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,680
Speaker 4:  looking at it saying, yeah, we think we can, we think we have something that

157
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,360
Speaker 4:  we think we can do is much better, that we'll raise the bar

158
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,840
Speaker 4:  enough that it's something that we can be really proud of. And so

159
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,520
Speaker 4:  we, you know, know, kind of take a leap of faith in that moment to say, okay,

160
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,560
Speaker 4:  what are the things we need to do to make this product even better? Can we

161
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,840
Speaker 4:  do those things? Can we fit it in there? And do we think it's really gonna

162
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,200
Speaker 4:  stand for kind of that leap in innovation and quality? And we feel like we've

163
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,640
Speaker 4:  delivered that with the A 100.

164
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,600
Speaker 2:  So the Air 100 is a stereo speaker and a single package to

165
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,000
Speaker 2:  tweeters the top, I think a bigger wha for than before

166
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,440
Speaker 5:  Another one, which is a mono speaker. This is a, this is moving stereo. And,

167
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,640
Speaker 5:  and listen, I love and I still love the one, and it's interesting, I can

168
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,160
Speaker 5:  walk into a restaurant or a bar and tell whether there's a one in the bar

169
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,960
Speaker 5:  because it's a, you know, and in my other world of pro audio

170
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,320
Speaker 5:  and creating content, you know, one is used the reference by a lot of it,

171
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,240
Speaker 5:  a lot of engineers and producers because it's a really honest speaker. Well,

172
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,160
Speaker 5:  I mean, there isn't a hypey anything. It's, it's a very, very good scale

173
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,120
Speaker 5:  down version of what we try and do in a studio. That's what one does. But

174
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,760
Speaker 5:  in a mono format, that mono format is limiting because it, you lose things

175
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,360
Speaker 5:  like reverb tales and voices. The reality of the things, we don't listen

176
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,120
Speaker 5:  to music in mono. So with ERA 100, we try to, we, we thought, okay, let's

177
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,280
Speaker 5:  rethink this then, okay, we need to add more weight behind it, we need more,

178
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,200
Speaker 5:  more base. We increased the water size, we by 25%. It was tough

179
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,120
Speaker 5:  though. It was a really tough challenge. It's like, you know, your children

180
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,920
Speaker 5:  have to grow up, you know, that's the thing. And it's like, you know, I

181
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,200
Speaker 5:  really feel like that when we were doing it,

182
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,360
Speaker 2:  One of the themes I see kind of across the big tech players in audio

183
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,960
Speaker 2:  is they're adding an awful lot of computation to their

184
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,320
Speaker 2:  speakers. Especially your, the direct competitor says something like the

185
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,680
Speaker 2:  A 100 A 100 does not seem like it's doing an awful lot of

186
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,360
Speaker 2:  excessive computational tricks. Right. There's a crossover for the two

187
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,120
Speaker 2:  tweeters that create the stereo field. Correct. There's a mono woofer. Yeah.

188
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,840
Speaker 2:  And that's the game. You're not, it's

189
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,800
Speaker 5:  Key for us as a company that you listen to music and not technology.

190
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,040
Speaker 5:  It's like one of those things where we try not to hype anything at all. We

191
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,320
Speaker 5:  try not. And however dull it may sound as marketing speak, it's like having

192
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Speaker 5:  a clear window on the world of sound. You wanna literally just switch on

193
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,280
Speaker 5:  a light or switch on music in your home. And it sounds great. And

194
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,160
Speaker 5:  the strange thing about artifacts and and crazy stuff that's done

195
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,480
Speaker 5:  is after a while it wears really thin and it becomes

196
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,120
Speaker 5:  irritating when anything else. And and someone said to me the other day when

197
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,080
Speaker 5:  listening to products, they went, they sound like sonar speakers. And I was

198
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,120
Speaker 5:  like, well that's interesting from, you know, from my point of view, I don't

199
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,640
Speaker 5:  try and give us a sound. And they said, what you, what does that mean? And

200
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,400
Speaker 5:  he went, sounds musical. I was like, great. Okay. That's what it should be.

201
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,320
Speaker 5:  And so, you know, we are doing a lot of stuff under the bonnet and we

202
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,080
Speaker 5:  really are, you know, there's, it's a bit like fighter jets. They'd probably

203
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,040
Speaker 5:  fall outta the air if it wasn't the amount of DSP we're using. But I

204
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,280
Speaker 5:  don't want to, you know, you don't want people to hear that. You don't want

205
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,640
Speaker 5:  people to, you want people to hear a song

206
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,360
Speaker 2:  A very subtly lited trap for you about excessive processing because Right.

207
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,200
Speaker 2:  Spatial audio is like a lot of processing to make that work. And

208
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,520
Speaker 2:  so when you think about the Arrow 100, it does not have any spatial features.

209
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,400
Speaker 2:  It doesn't have the height channels. Well it's, but you're saying

210
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,840
Speaker 2:  there is processing happening inside of it.

211
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah, of course. Because you know, we're, we're doing, you know, for a start

212
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,400
Speaker 5:  we are, we're trying to create a bigger sound than the box is. We're trying

213
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,720
Speaker 5:  to defy physics all of the time at Sanos. That's what we're trying to do.

214
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,360
Speaker 5:  We're not doing any tricks with phase, but we are, you know, you, there are

215
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,600
Speaker 5:  slight delay going on there to create a stereo spread at the high frequencies.

216
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,760
Speaker 5:  You have to do that at the same time. The most, the the key thing for me

217
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,680
Speaker 5:  in this, actually, what we worked really hard on the, on the, on the 100

218
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,360
Speaker 5:  was we could make the product a lot wider and more

219
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,160
Speaker 5:  spatial than it is. But the detriment to that is voices. The human voice

220
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,680
Speaker 5:  doesn't sound as good. Yeah. You know, because when you know your listeners

221
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,600
Speaker 5:  listen to music, we mix music in stereo and equal left and right

222
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,800
Speaker 5:  is mono and that's generally where the voice lies. And that's the songs you

223
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,400
Speaker 5:  love. If you pull that apart too much, it's, it can sound phasia, it can

224
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,040
Speaker 5:  sound weird. And so it's that argument processing over reality.

225
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,080
Speaker 5:  Of course it's processing, but the key thing is that is it has to sound natural

226
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,800
Speaker 5:  and that's done by human ear. You know, you can't measure natural weirdly

227
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,960
Speaker 5:  enough things can measure completely flat in a room and then sound strange.

228
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,680
Speaker 2:  I feel like I'm so tempted to just immediately start talking about facial

229
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,680
Speaker 2:  audio, but I wanna finish talking about the air 100. Yeah. Because to me

230
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,640
Speaker 2:  the argument with facial audio is when it's done incorrectly or

231
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,000
Speaker 2:  done poorly, you actually lose a lot of that impact. You spread everything

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,840
Speaker 2:  out to, to too many channels. Yeah. And everything is,

233
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,280
Speaker 5:  And the same if you play around a stereo too much, if you like, you know,

234
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,120
Speaker 5:  we don't specialize stereo because again, it feels, it's a bit like

235
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,960
Speaker 5:  smashing some of the toffy ham hammer you, everything flies everywhere and

236
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,560
Speaker 5:  you're left with no middle. It's impact like just drums and

237
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,960
Speaker 5:  vocals. And it's fine actually if, if it's a spatial studio tracker, it's

238
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,800
Speaker 5:  ambient tracking to whatever you all bets are off. And sometimes with classical

239
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,760
Speaker 5:  music that helps. But generally, like most pop music or

240
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,640
Speaker 5:  hip hop or r and b is like, it needs that, it needs that dry behind it.

241
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,760
Speaker 5:  And it's really important to mention, we have this sort of team of checks

242
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,680
Speaker 5:  and bounces. We have this soundboard, which we run where, you know, like

243
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,480
Speaker 5:  Mary Marquin is just won three Grammy awards. He's won, he's now won

244
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,400
Speaker 5:  17 Grammy awards. And so, you know, he mixes Lizzo, it's a similar, we'll

245
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,240
Speaker 5:  play Lizzo on era 100 and if it doesn't sound right, we,

246
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,800
Speaker 5:  when our job isn't done, you know, it's that important thing. It's that scalability.

247
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,120
Speaker 5:  You have to be honest. You have to be honest about what you're making. Kind

248
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,480
Speaker 5:  of like this Napoleon complex of a little speaker going, wait a second, I

249
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,040
Speaker 5:  beat myself through war. So you just have to make the best, you have to be

250
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,880
Speaker 5:  honest and the, and then that becomes, that honesty translates into your

251
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,360
Speaker 5:  home and you enjoy listening to it.

252
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,240
Speaker 4:  But I think that honesty is a key and it, it, you know, it sounds

253
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,840
Speaker 4:  somewhat cliche, but I think to Gil's point about the soundboard and all

254
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,560
Speaker 4:  the people that we have on it and all the people in Giles network, we have

255
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,920
Speaker 4:  them listen to these speakers and the mixes that they've done. You know,

256
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,880
Speaker 4:  whether it's the 100 or 300 to say like, does this sound

257
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,160
Speaker 4:  as you intended it? Right. And actually go through that. And I don't know

258
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,760
Speaker 4:  another company that spends the amount of time we do going through

259
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,600
Speaker 4:  that work on the way to actually launching a product. And it's,

260
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,320
Speaker 4:  it's so important to making sure that we're getting it right.

261
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So the Arrow 100 it direct replacement, you're

262
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,920
Speaker 2:  getting itchy with the Sonos one. Sonos one very popular.

263
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,600
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And has multiple configurations. Are you gonna do an Arrow 100 SL

264
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,000
Speaker 2:  without the microphones? You

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,680
Speaker 4:  Know, we're always considering, you know, what customers will want on that

266
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,480
Speaker 4:  front. So we'll see, you know, what kind of feedback we get at this point.

267
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,160
Speaker 2:  Are you leaving the one SL in the lineup? We are. Okay for now. Yeah. And

268
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,760
Speaker 2:  then I noticed we talked about Alexa a bunch of times today. Yeah. Does it

269
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,800
Speaker 2:  support Google Assistant as well?

270
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,360
Speaker 4:  Google Assistant has changed the way that they're implementing it for third

271
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,080
Speaker 4:  parties. And so that's changed. So at this point it won't support

272
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,800
Speaker 4:  Google Assistant. Our existing products that support Google Assistant will

273
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,880
Speaker 4:  continue to, but 100 300 will not.

274
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,720
Speaker 2:  Is that because Google made a change or is that because Google, Google change

275
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,240
Speaker 2:  litigation

276
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,040
Speaker 4:  Between you? Google has nothing to do with the ongoing litigation. You know,

277
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,920
Speaker 4:  as you and I have talked about before, they, you know, YouTube music, like

278
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,840
Speaker 4:  all the different aspects, Google Assistant, the teams continue to work pretty

279
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,200
Speaker 4:  constructively. But they did make a change in terms of how they do Google

280
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,760
Speaker 4:  Assistant on third party products. And it's a pretty big engineering lift

281
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,200
Speaker 4:  for us. And, and the reality is right now we'd like to see it back on the

282
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,320
Speaker 4:  platform. But you know, people are using voice for music timers

283
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,960
Speaker 4:  and weather Right. As they have for many years as you know. And we're well

284
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,000
Speaker 4:  covered with what we have with solo's voice control and Alexa. So we feel

285
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,640
Speaker 4:  pretty good about where we are with these products.

286
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,240
Speaker 2:  Did you assemble a task force to be like, all right, we need Bing to insult

287
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,800
Speaker 2:  people directly from our speakers. Just let it go crazy chat

288
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,120
Speaker 2:  GBT is the future. Just let let people talk to the ai

289
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,520
Speaker 4:  We'll we'll let you sort it all out. Okay. And then we'll figure out how

290
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,200
Speaker 4:  we, every

291
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,000
Speaker 2:  Other company had to like do some sort of weird code red

292
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,160
Speaker 4:  Exercise. No, we will focus on creating great speakers that people can listen

293
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,120
Speaker 4:  to amazing music on the

294
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,640
Speaker 2:  Sonos. I'll figure out as soon as reads all of Tumblr and says, your music

295
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,600
Speaker 2:  taste as shit is not coming. No. Because I, there are people that would buy

296
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Speaker 2:  that product specifically. Yeah. There was like, the song sucks.

297
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,840
Speaker 2:  There's a better version of the song. It's the original. You're

298
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,640
Speaker 4:  Late. Well our friends at Spotify did introduce DJ today in

299
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,000
Speaker 4:  ai dj, I don't know if you saw that. So

300
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,040
Speaker 2:  There you go. This is the future is like you start listening to an album

301
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,280
Speaker 2:  and it's like, I like the second album Better people. I know people like

302
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,840
Speaker 2:  my friends would be like, I just want someone to talk to me about music no

303
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,360
Speaker 2:  matter what it says.

304
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,480
Speaker 5:  I don't have my own opinion.

305
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,480
Speaker 2:  Exactly.

306
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,400
Speaker 5:  That's what they're saying. I want a computer, have my opinion. Yeah.

307
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,320
Speaker 2:  Feed in all of Pitchfork and then Pitchfork will tell you whatever you're

308
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,040
Speaker 2:  listening to at six.

309
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,920
Speaker 5:  Tell me, tell me what I really like Zach. We, we can go to very deep conversation

310
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,760
Speaker 5:  about art and anomalies and art about that

311
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,640
Speaker 2:  Music. Yeah. And all of those conversations always kind of sound like you're

312
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,240
Speaker 2:  having them with a moody computer anyway. Yes.

313
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:05,680
Speaker 4:  So

314
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,480
Speaker 2:  That's right. Big focus on sustainability with the 100 and the

315
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,400
Speaker 2:  300 lots of recycled plastic. Yeah. We saw some custom

316
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,480
Speaker 2:  screws today. Yeah. There's more screws instead of

317
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:15,680
Speaker 4:  Glue.

318
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,360
Speaker 2:  93, 93 screws in the 100,

319
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,040
Speaker 4:  In the 300

320
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,920
Speaker 2:  In 300 u c when someone says we only use screws instead of glue.

321
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,520
Speaker 2:  Also we need to make custom screws with hearts in them specifically.

322
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,120
Speaker 2:  That's more cost. How do you weigh that kind of decision?

323
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:33,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah, we're building products for, you know, the decade, right? As we look

324
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,920
Speaker 4:  at where we're trying to, trying to do, we think the biggest thing we can

325
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,520
Speaker 4:  do for the environment for our customers is make sure these products last

326
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,880
Speaker 4:  for a really long time. But we're always looking and pushing on what parts

327
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,560
Speaker 4:  can be used from recycled, how do we do all of these things? How do we

328
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,840
Speaker 4:  improve repairability? That's been a huge issue. And so the screws come in

329
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,560
Speaker 4:  big when we're thinking about being able to repair instead of using

330
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,080
Speaker 4:  adhesives and being in situations where we have to throw away product. Cuz

331
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,800
Speaker 4:  you just don't wanna do that. So what I'm most proud of is we're getting

332
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,880
Speaker 4:  better and better, not just on those fronts, but as well in terms of energy

333
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,800
Speaker 4:  usage, which with each of the products. But I always feel like at the

334
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,600
Speaker 4:  core, the most important thing is are we building something that can, you

335
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,440
Speaker 4:  know, reasonably last in someone's house for a decade. Right? And I think

336
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,240
Speaker 4:  we do that better than anybody else out there. And we'll, we will continue

337
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,080
Speaker 4:  to push on what other parts can come from, you know, recycled materials and

338
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,760
Speaker 4:  all of those things. How do we get better on repairability? We've made a

339
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,120
Speaker 4:  huge leap with era, which is why we've decided like to call this a whole

340
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,880
Speaker 4:  new line, proud of that and we're gonna keep working on it. And

341
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,800
Speaker 4:  it, it all makes sense when you're playing the long game from a cost and

342
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,520
Speaker 4:  investment perspective because I feel like you get more than that

343
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,960
Speaker 4:  back over time in customer loyalty and everything else that we're trying

344
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,280
Speaker 4:  to build.

345
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,400
Speaker 2:  Speakers are one of those products that sit around people's houses for, for

346
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,080
Speaker 2:  decades. Yeah. If not more. Obviously Sonos has had a number of different

347
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,840
Speaker 2:  approaches to upgrading products, trading products in this is something you

348
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,880
Speaker 2:  can take apart. Do you have a thought one day maybe we'll just replace the

349
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,120
Speaker 2:  sort of computer elements of these speakers and leave the drivers alone.

350
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,200
Speaker 4:  I have a real hope that one day that's a possibility. People call me

351
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,920
Speaker 4:  crazy for doing it. Giles might even right now. But I do, I do think

352
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Speaker 4:  that's a potential possibility in the future and I'd love to see something

353
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,160
Speaker 4:  like that and I'd love to see us pushing on how to, how to be that company.

354
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah. From your perspective on the audio front, right? A, a

355
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,360
Speaker 2:  great pair of vintage speakers and a stereo set up with an all like people

356
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,680
Speaker 2:  worship at the Alt, I'm one of these people, I'm just gonna admit it, but

357
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,160
Speaker 2:  they last forever. And the sound there is lasting in a way

358
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,080
Speaker 2:  that some people would argue cannot be defeated. A small computer with a

359
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,360
Speaker 2:  bunch of radios in it that happens to have a digital amplifier and a driver.

360
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,040
Speaker 2:  Do you think that can be as long-lasting?

361
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,720
Speaker 5:  It it's based on CPU and not ledge. I mean I would argue that people blow

362
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,160
Speaker 5:  blow old speakers all the time. Yeah. So, and I've been in situations where

363
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,600
Speaker 5:  I've been in very high end audio places where they playback mix. I've done

364
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,880
Speaker 5:  and I've gone, your left channels a bit weird. And they go, oh, valve's just

365
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,360
Speaker 5:  gone. Sorry. So I, there there's, there's, there's a lot of ways looking

366
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,160
Speaker 5:  at this. Yeah. There really is. Yeah. I think that, I think we proved

367
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,560
Speaker 5:  actually, you know, Rick Rubin had a, an old play five outside his porch

368
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,200
Speaker 5:  for 10 years, you know, in the rain. Yeah. And it

369
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,160
Speaker 5:  lasted and that's not even we,

370
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,880
Speaker 2:  I think the last time Patrick was here I was like, why didn't you make an

371
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,680
Speaker 2:  outdoor speaker? And he was like, I know a famous producer had a play five,

372
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,040
Speaker 2:  so thank you for outing him.

373
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,760
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. It's great. I'm not done actually I did his podcast

374
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,000
Speaker 5:  recently. I get done. He'll be okay. He's a good mate. So yeah,

375
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,960
Speaker 5:  I think that, I think I love the idea and the ethos of Sonos. I

376
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,400
Speaker 5:  mean actually it's one of those things that, that, you know, I got involved

377
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,640
Speaker 5:  in Sonos nine years ago now because they were the first coming that asked

378
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,600
Speaker 5:  me what was wrong about the sound of the, as opposed to

379
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,400
Speaker 5:  tell us how great we are. And then on top of that, I love the ethos of we

380
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,200
Speaker 5:  want these products to last because why not? We're not asking you to

381
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,040
Speaker 5:  replace 'em. We're asking you to put more in your more in your your house.

382
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,680
Speaker 5:  That's the thing. You know, it's, it's expensive for us to do that. It's

383
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,880
Speaker 5:  expensive for us for a number of different reasons for us to keep products

384
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,600
Speaker 5:  in the marketplace. But it's the right thing to do. I think there'll always

385
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,560
Speaker 5:  be a place for, you know, your, the the listen, I have

386
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,680
Speaker 5:  a whole load of speakers, you know, I have a full studio so I have

387
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,800
Speaker 5:  Abbey Road to use. I think there's a place for things. But just as far

388
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,520
Speaker 5:  as that ability to go think of a song and

389
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,560
Speaker 5:  thinking of a song to listening to it, to wake up with music or have music

390
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,360
Speaker 5:  in your house or, or or gathering your mates and listening son

391
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,720
Speaker 5:  is just brilliant. And that's what everyone says to me. And from my own experience,

392
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,640
Speaker 5:  before I got sent a play three and a play five, I met a guy and I was

393
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,320
Speaker 5:  in the studios in LA and they sent it back, sent to my house in London. You

394
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,640
Speaker 5:  know, my wife was happy for me to have these speakers in the home, which

395
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,280
Speaker 5:  is very rare. Well my dad who was George Martin famous rugby producer, he

396
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,760
Speaker 5:  had no, we had no speakers. And the, he listen to mixes in the car and suddenly

397
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,440
Speaker 5:  we had music in our house. And that's the thing is that there's two different

398
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,040
Speaker 5:  ways and I think everything is, there's no better or worse.

399
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,160
Speaker 5:  It's like vinyl digital, what's your choice? It's like just enjoy music.

400
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

401
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,920
Speaker 2:  It's like push towards lossless. And we're gonna talk about spatial, but

402
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,280
Speaker 2:  lossless and spatial seem to have come along at the same time, at least for

403
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,120
Speaker 2:  the major streaming services. Can you hear the difference between 1 92

404
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,320
Speaker 2:  and Lossless and the era 100?

405
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,800
Speaker 5:  No One era 100. No, but it's not that type of unit. It's not

406
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,440
Speaker 5:  like, you know, it's not a reference. We're not trying to build reference

407
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,960
Speaker 5:  speakers. We're trying to build, again, it's like we're trying to build

408
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,560
Speaker 5:  the best possible scenarios so you can enjoy all the music in the home.

409
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,680
Speaker 5:  And it's, there's an interesting point about this because you know, I

410
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,600
Speaker 5:  have a quarter million dollar setup in my studios and

411
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,400
Speaker 5:  yes. And I work, I'm head of Audio and Sound Universal Music Group

412
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,400
Speaker 5:  and I work, I consult with Apple and other stream of services

413
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,640
Speaker 5:  over their quality of their codex and all that sort of stuff. Yes I am that

414
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,480
Speaker 5:  person. However, there's a point where shouldn't you just enjoy a song?

415
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,280
Speaker 5:  Do you know what I mean? Yeah. She's, and people and people talking about

416
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,080
Speaker 5:  numbers all the time. Would you prefer 1 92 or 96 or what the, it's like,

417
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,000
Speaker 5:  wait a second, it's, I'm involved in this. It's just, you know, and I

418
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,360
Speaker 5:  can hear the between certain things and we've done tests and we've sent and

419
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,080
Speaker 5:  we've done tests with s cause we're really interested in this. This is super

420
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,040
Speaker 5:  interesting cause we have to make decisions based on this with pros like

421
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,240
Speaker 5:  mastering engineers. And I have this brilliant guy, Greg McCarty works for

422
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,120
Speaker 5:  me and he invented the system where we'd send Pro tools sessions out with

423
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,880
Speaker 5:  96, 20, 96, 24 files, Spotify streams, apple

424
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,760
Speaker 5:  streams, streams, unnamed on and people's songs.

425
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,320
Speaker 5:  They'd mixed and we're sensing which one do you prefer out of like

426
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,560
Speaker 5:  completely blind listening. And it's amazing how many people didn't wanna

427
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,520
Speaker 5:  do it, you know, there we are. So, so I

428
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,080
Speaker 5:  think what we need to do is focus on the best possible experience from people

429
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,600
Speaker 5:  farm to table as you'd say is the best possible experience. And it's how

430
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,480
Speaker 5:  do we get to that without transients and other objects, artifacts

431
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,360
Speaker 5:  going on and being honest about it's key.

432
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,440
Speaker 2:  Last question on the 100, there's no height channels,

433
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,240
Speaker 2:  there's no spatial push with the 100 you can still use in these rears.

434
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,400
Speaker 2:  Yep. But why no height channels? Why no spatial on the 100? You know,

435
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,960
Speaker 4:  We're in the early days of Spacial for sure. We wanted to

436
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,840
Speaker 4:  really make sure that as we bring a product to the world that

437
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,640
Speaker 4:  delivers the best, you know, experience and sets the bar, we wanted to

438
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,880
Speaker 4:  start with the 300. And we think they're, you know, to J's point of like

439
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,200
Speaker 4:  listening to music and people listening to music and that there's room for

440
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,680
Speaker 4:  stereo speakers as well. So you'll see we keep the five in the portfolio

441
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,880
Speaker 4:  as well for people that want to enjoy that. And we're in a, we're in a transition

442
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,480
Speaker 4:  period. To me that's similar to the mono to stereo

443
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,240
Speaker 4:  transition period where there's a lot of emotional energy about that transition.

444
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,680
Speaker 4:  It took actually decades if you look back on it. And there was both

445
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,280
Speaker 4:  for a while, mono and stereo and going through that. And so I think there's

446
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,040
Speaker 4:  going to continue to be over this next period and we wanna be there for customers

447
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,880
Speaker 4:  no matter what they choose.

448
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think there's people who are wondering, okay, I want the full

449
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,520
Speaker 2:  atmo setup from Sonos, particularly from movies to get

450
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,480
Speaker 2:  up firing rears now is a $900 investment. Am I looking at

451
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,520
Speaker 2:  a future where it will always be a $900 investment or are you planning on

452
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,400
Speaker 2:  building that out over

453
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,800
Speaker 4:  Time? Well, I mean that's what is that $90 a year,

454
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,800
Speaker 4:  you know, as you think about it? Or like, you know, we're talking 10 bucks,

455
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,640
Speaker 4:  you know, a month, a month kind of thing as we go through it, 10, 20 bucks.

456
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,600
Speaker 4:  So I think for the kind of experience that we deliver, I think there's value

457
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,560
Speaker 4:  for money in that for sure.

458
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,600
Speaker 2:  From your perspective, as you think about the split between using these speakers

459
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,240
Speaker 2:  for spacial audio atmos music and then what's

460
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,080
Speaker 2:  required for a great movie experience, is there a trade

461
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,200
Speaker 2:  off that you've made? Is there a balancing that needs to be done or is it

462
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,600
Speaker 5:  No, I mean the first, it's funny, you know, when you're building a

463
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,200
Speaker 5:  product which is, has multi sort of use and orientations, you do prioritize,

464
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,960
Speaker 5:  you do prioritize in a way of like, what's the wow factor? The wow factor,

465
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,760
Speaker 5:  which I think is truly extraordinary out of the 300 is the fact that it does

466
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,960
Speaker 5:  spatial out of a single box and it's really compelling. Yeah. To me it's

467
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,440
Speaker 5:  like there's nothing else on the planet that does what this does.

468
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,800
Speaker 5:  I'm saying as a creator and other creators as well. I mean, I I I

469
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,280
Speaker 5:  say to people and I'm, I'm not really Mr. Jargon at all. I'm pretty honest

470
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,720
Speaker 5:  and I love music, I love sound, I love, you know, I'm passionate. And I'll

471
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,800
Speaker 5:  say to people, I mean I, I was at CS of bumps and produced engineers. I went,

472
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,680
Speaker 5:  it really is amazing. Like they come to my suite and they go, oh my God,

473
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,080
Speaker 5:  this really is amazing. The guitar's like over by, I had a bar area cuz that's

474
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,400
Speaker 5:  the way I roll. It's over by the bar area. Like I'm gonna, you know, that's

475
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,760
Speaker 5:  where the guitars are and it's like I told you and they went, yeah but you

476
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,600
Speaker 5:  know, we didn't. So the single boxing was great and then if there's two of

477
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,880
Speaker 5:  them, it'll do stereo, pure stereo and Dolby Atmos had a stereo.

478
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,840
Speaker 5:  Interesting enough, the way we think about it, doing stereo stereo atmos

479
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,680
Speaker 5:  or two speakers creating Atmos is creating front firing height sides

480
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,880
Speaker 5:  rears. And you've turned those around the other way. That's your home theater

481
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,520
Speaker 5:  setup. You're adding, you are adding. So, so it's kind of the same problem.

482
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,960
Speaker 5:  If you like it, an audio perspective or the same solution is probably a better

483
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,600
Speaker 5:  way of putting it. So that's the way we work. And there is an

484
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,680
Speaker 5:  additive and compelling drive behind doing this. It's, it's,

485
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,080
Speaker 5:  you'd be surprised. I mean I started working Space audio a long time ago

486
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,640
Speaker 5:  and did before Think Sergeant Peppers, the Beatles SLU Peppers album was

487
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,440
Speaker 5:  the first album done in special audio, which I mixed, I then did kick by

488
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,960
Speaker 5:  Ns and they, they were both used for, they played them back in theaters

489
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,840
Speaker 5:  when I did Kick and they made the the Blu-ray, cuz that's going back that

490
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,800
Speaker 5:  far. I went to Capital Studios and the rears were too loud. I went to

491
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,040
Speaker 5:  Dolby Wooden Ambassador, the sub was too loud. I went to Dolby and so

492
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,840
Speaker 5:  Square and the right hand speaker was too loud. Quantum, with Discrete Systems,

493
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,760
Speaker 5:  you can be in a situation where people don't set them up correctly. The

494
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,640
Speaker 5:  elegance of having one box multichannel systems like Arc

495
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,480
Speaker 5:  plus two 300 s is is a pretty good chance for true play. It's gonna be a

496
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,640
Speaker 5:  even balanced sound. It's gonna be rendering. And the dangerous thing about

497
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,600
Speaker 5:  space audio, in fact you get the channel mixed wrong. It's worse a

498
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,000
Speaker 5:  mono, but we have to make sure we we get that right every

499
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,720
Speaker 2:  Time the high channels are based on bouncing off the ceiling. Right? That's

500
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,160
Speaker 2:  right. Do you need to do True play to get the phose effect?

501
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,360
Speaker 5:  No you don't. But true play does we'll adjust delays and

502
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,840
Speaker 5:  and levels and eq you know, we, we do True play for a reason.

503
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,760
Speaker 5:  Indeed. You might find that we might even reduce the Height channel

504
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,280
Speaker 5:  sbl because of true play. All it does is it's, it's matching levels.

505
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:55,320
Speaker 5:  So you know, it's not like your heights won't, it's not that your heights

506
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,960
Speaker 5:  won't work if you don't use True Play, but your balance will

507
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Speaker 5:  improve and your sound will improve if you do use it.

508
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,040
Speaker 2:  We've gotta take a quick break, but we'll be back with more of my conversation

509
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,640
Speaker 2:  with Patrick Spence and Giles. Mark

510
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,540
Speaker 7:  Al Bruno ran the mob in Springfield, Massachusetts,

511
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,540
Speaker 8:  US growing up Italian and you want to be a criminal. Bruno was the guy that

512
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,180
Speaker 8:  we looked up to

513
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,140
Speaker 7:  Till he was gunned down in 2003.

514
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,660
Speaker 9:  Now Bruno just took about eight to the body at the Italian club on Winthrop

515
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,660
Speaker 9:  Street. I'm like, oh Jesus.

516
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,020
Speaker 7:  Bruno's murder was a mystery but also an

517
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,860
Speaker 7:  opportunity. It was law enforcement's best shot at taking down the

518
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,340
Speaker 7:  Springfield Mafia once and for all.

519
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,380
Speaker 7:  I'm Elliot Am Ellie Honig host of Up Against the Mob, the

520
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,100
Speaker 7:  Springfield crew. As a federal prosecutor, I took down over

521
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,060
Speaker 7:  100 mobsters, but nothing was as wild as what went

522
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,300
Speaker 7:  down in Springfield.

523
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,260
Speaker 10:  Call 9 1 1. I've been shot

524
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,460
Speaker 7:  To solve the case. We'd have to convince made men to break their code

525
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,260
Speaker 7:  of silence.

526
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,020
Speaker 8:  You can't put your hands on 'em or you get killed.

527
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,940
Speaker 7:  And as the dominoes started to fall, all of us just looked at each

528
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,420
Speaker 11:  Other like this case is blowing up,

529
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:18,020
Speaker 7:  Up against the mob, the Springfield crew from Cafe

530
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,300
Speaker 7:  and the Vox Media podcast Network. Following your listening app to hear

531
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,020
Speaker 7:  new episodes every Wednesday.

532
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,710
Speaker 11:  Unexplainable has got a new three part series called Origins.

533
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,840
Speaker 11:  It's all about the beginnings and boundaries of life on earth.

534
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,680
Speaker 12:  Every marvelous living creature on our earth is built of complex

535
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,640
Speaker 12:  living cells.

536
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,120
Speaker 13:  Life is made up of atoms, molecules and chemical

537
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,080
Speaker 13:  reactions.

538
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,760
Speaker 12:  But what makes them alive?

539
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,280
Speaker 11:  Where did Earth's water come from? How did life

540
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,880
Speaker 11:  actually start? And I don't know, just

541
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,000
Speaker 13:  What is life

542
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,920
Speaker 11:  Origins from Unexplainable starting March 1st.

543
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,760
Speaker 11:  Follow Unexplainable for new episodes every Wednesday.

544
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,850
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. So there 100 is kind of the big step forward here.

545
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,210
Speaker 2:  It's the big investment into Spacial. We are looking around,

546
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,130
Speaker 2:  we are pretty sure this is the first standalone spatial audio speaker that

547
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,810
Speaker 2:  is not connected inherently to a streaming service, right? Apple obviously

548
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:33,010
Speaker 2:  makes the HomePod, Amazon makes the Echo Studio. They would argue that there's

549
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,570
Speaker 2:  some inherent connection there that makes everything work together better.

550
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,970
Speaker 2:  What made you think it's okay we have to invest in this, this is the next

551
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,650
Speaker 2:  great audio format.

552
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,850
Speaker 4:  It was really hearing from Giles and Chris Davies and our audio

553
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,690
Speaker 4:  team. We had a ton of debates in the Lossless period and like, hi

554
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:50,770
Speaker 4:  Rez hd, can you hear a difference? Should we invest in this? What should

555
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,570
Speaker 4:  we support or not? And we landed in the, okay, there

556
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,730
Speaker 4:  isn't a difference. We're not gonna go, you know, just chase this next technology.

557
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,330
Speaker 4:  And you know, I mean Sonos is known for taking our time to

558
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:05,370
Speaker 4:  consider what's happening and it was really an understanding of what was

559
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:09,130
Speaker 4:  happening with the artists and were they beginning to embrace it and they

560
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,490
Speaker 4:  were. And so we saw that three years ago and the labels starting to embrace

561
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,930
Speaker 4:  it and it seemed like there was, there was actually momentum in the industry

562
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,530
Speaker 4:  starting to happen. So, well it was a chance though at that point cuz it,

563
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,450
Speaker 4:  you know, we didn't know that in 2022, you know, 85 of the top

564
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,890
Speaker 4:  100 billboard 100 artists would actually release at most tracks. But they

565
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,330
Speaker 4:  did. And so that's a good thing. We're at a, we feel like we're at an inflection

566
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:33,170
Speaker 4:  point where more and more people are are releasing an Atmos, which is great,

567
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,850
Speaker 4:  but that was the bet that we basically made and it was on the back of

568
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,730
Speaker 4:  Giles and Chris and the team basically saying, no, no this is special

569
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,730
Speaker 4:  and this is one that mimics that jump from, you

570
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,290
Speaker 4:  know, mono to stereo and this is the next big one that artists are actually

571
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,490
Speaker 4:  embracing. And so, you know, for us then it's like, okay, we gotta be there

572
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,170
Speaker 4:  and we've gotta do this right? And so that took some time to go build as

573
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,730
Speaker 4:  well and do it right. But you know, if we're gonna do it, we're going to

574
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,130
Speaker 4:  try and really set the bar. And I feel like we have, with this product

575
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,250
Speaker 2:  You're launching with support for special from two services,

576
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,890
Speaker 2:  Amazon Music, HD Apple Music, they are

577
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,210
Speaker 2:  not quite the same. Right? There are some format differences between how

578
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,170
Speaker 2:  the services deliver spatial audio. That seems weird to

579
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,610
Speaker 2:  me. What's going on there?

580
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,930
Speaker 5:  It's not down to us. You know, if it was, it wouldn't be.

581
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,930
Speaker 5:  Let's say it's not that the music industry, it's like bearing in mind that

582
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,850
Speaker 5:  I have this weird position where I am, you know, head of audio and sound

583
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,730
Speaker 5:  for both Universal and Sauna. So I I'm at the, the

584
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,210
Speaker 5:  beginning of the source. Yeah. And at the end of the source, which is kind

585
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,080
Speaker 5:  of useful and actually beneficial to, you know, where Universal approached

586
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,800
Speaker 5:  me after Sonos Universal has been three years, four years. And I said, listen,

587
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,520
Speaker 5:  you know, I do and I'm loyal to Sonos. I went, no, I think we think it's

588
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,280
Speaker 5:  a good thing and you know, we work, we work together because you know, I

589
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,000
Speaker 5:  knew at the top of the source, the stream that there'll be Atmos, the spatial

590
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,840
Speaker 5:  audio was coming down the pipe. So I'm like going, we need to embrace this.

591
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,200
Speaker 5:  The way that Amazon or Apple deal with this is not

592
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,520
Speaker 5:  down to us. It's not down to universally, it's down to down to them. And

593
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,200
Speaker 5:  you know, we just have to, we, we have to partner with people and we have

594
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,000
Speaker 5:  to be Switzerland. You know, if that's a not very old reference as far as

595
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,920
Speaker 5:  this is important to us that we provide an ecosystem that the,

596
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,480
Speaker 5:  that the music lover just, I want to use the service so I should listen to

597
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:20,800
Speaker 5:  it. But

598
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,560
Speaker 2:  As a music lover, I know now when I'm listening to

599
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,280
Speaker 2:  Apple, okay, there's an Atmos logo here. These often sound

600
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,080
Speaker 2:  better than the generic spatial audio logo. And this whole thing

601
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,480
Speaker 2:  sounds different than what Amazon is doing. What are the differences there

602
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,000
Speaker 2:  that you have to

603
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,920
Speaker 5:  Contend? Okay, so I don't think, I'm not hearing a master between

604
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,920
Speaker 5:  Amazon Atmos and, and Apple Atmos. There's Also's only 360

605
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,520
Speaker 5:  to bear in mind

606
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,200
Speaker 2:  And Amazon sports side as well.

607
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. And suppose that, so occasionally. And then there's the headphone

608
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,240
Speaker 5:  thing as well. So if you listen to headphones, the way that Apple renders

609
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,080
Speaker 5:  Boral is different the way that Amazon renders up Boral. So everyone's confusing.

610
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,480
Speaker 5:  When you listen to an ERA 300, it'll be the same

611
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,560
Speaker 2:  The atmo next.

612
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So, so, so if you think about it, I I, I was surprised. I

613
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,400
Speaker 5:  I created this, this love show in, in Vegas with 7,000 speakers in a room,

614
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,120
Speaker 5:  which is essentially the sort of template of Dolby Atmos. We have obviously

615
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,920
Speaker 5:  a lot of hype channels cause it's, it's in the round. I never thought, and

616
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,880
Speaker 5:  I made the this 5.1 album, which I thought was gonna be

617
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,680
Speaker 5:  the future of audio, but then I could never listen to it on a system because

618
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:26,760
Speaker 5:  I, you know, people don't have five one systems at that, at that stage. I

619
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,600
Speaker 5:  never thought the first steps in spatial audio would be headphones. Yeah.

620
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,840
Speaker 5:  What's interesting headphones actually is that it has become exponentially

621
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,800
Speaker 5:  better as an experience really, really quickly. I mean it was, I thought

622
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,920
Speaker 5:  it was un listenable about three years ago and now it's pretty good. However,

623
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,840
Speaker 5:  the confusing of the consumer, which is goes off top of us and, but it's

624
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,960
Speaker 5:  something that, you know, that we care about. Cause we care about sound experiences

625
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,920
Speaker 5:  for everything is that, you know, you can have a different

626
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,520
Speaker 5:  experience compared to on different headphones spatially as well as

627
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,120
Speaker 5:  spectorally. So EQ as well, spatially. And then on different streaming servers,

628
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,840
Speaker 5:  whether it's Amazon or Apple. And with the

629
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,720
Speaker 5:  Universal group itself speaking by the, it's one of the things we

630
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,640
Speaker 5:  are working with both Apple and Amazon and manufacturers on

631
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,320
Speaker 5:  unifying that experience. Cause it's bad for the artists. One other thing

632
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,000
Speaker 5:  else, it's, and it's, and it's the feedback we get from artists, whether

633
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,840
Speaker 5:  it's like Mick Jagger or Lizzo or wherever going, well

634
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,640
Speaker 5:  I'm not sure I wanna do this cause I don't, you lose control. It's like whack-a-mole

635
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,480
Speaker 5:  suddenly I've put in my music. And so you need that stability to

636
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,440
Speaker 5:  the, to the ecosystem on to make it work. One of the things we're doing with

637
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,160
Speaker 5:  ERA 300, which is really groundbreaking and benefits to the artists

638
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,640
Speaker 5:  as well, the benefits to Sonos is that we've developed a bunch of units

639
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,840
Speaker 5:  for artists where they can mix directly through as a reference speaker.

640
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,960
Speaker 5:  So which gives the bonus, like a, it reassures them that the mixes

641
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,920
Speaker 5:  can sound good out of a single box and B, they can give us feedback if

642
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,240
Speaker 5:  they don't like anything we are doing and we can change it. So with the B

643
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,080
Speaker 5:  or Kodak, that should happen as well. That should be a reference of what

644
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,600
Speaker 5:  it should be. And that's why you get, that's where we get confused about

645
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,520
Speaker 5:  the, where it's rendered.

646
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,000
Speaker 2:  So I would say that I thought headphone spatial audio

647
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,280
Speaker 2:  was really where I heard the loss of impact. Right. And it felt almost

648
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,440
Speaker 2:  like, I know you were going through a 90 CD player that had like the stadium

649
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,040
Speaker 2:  button.

650
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,800
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.

651
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,000
Speaker 2:  Spread everything out. Correct. And, and sort of empty everything out. Yeah.

652
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,760
Speaker 2:  The demos I heard today, obviously you were there, you made, made sure they

653
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,440
Speaker 2:  sounded good.

654
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,480
Speaker 5:  No, but I but you say that, but you know, and you asked me this question.

655
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So we, so listeners, we were in a room and picture us pictures, the

656
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,080
Speaker 5:  two of us in a room together, we're in a room with like, with where they

657
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,240
Speaker 5:  drew the curtains on the windows. Yeah.

658
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,000
Speaker 2:  Ceiling and glass

659
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,280
Speaker 5:  Wall. That's like with this, this special design. So you can have special,

660
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,960
Speaker 5:  it's like, no, this is design, so you can't have spatial audio. It's the

661
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,920
Speaker 5:  speakers in the corner of the room because we had an arc in front of a TV

662
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,800
Speaker 5:  should be, if it's the center you had an even balance all this kind of stuff.

663
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,480
Speaker 5:  But I think that's cool. It's like, you know, I don't believe that that's

664
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,720
Speaker 5:  the only time you're gonna listen to the product, so it's okay. Yeah. You

665
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,480
Speaker 5:  know, and I, it's so important. The impact is the most important

666
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,000
Speaker 5:  thing. Emotional connectivity is much important. That's why mono is kind

667
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,840
Speaker 5:  of cool. And that's way here. I talk about spatial audio on, on new product.

668
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,760
Speaker 5:  We've invested a million dollars in that impact of, and

669
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,480
Speaker 5:  it's funny, I listened, I did, I I I to a chemical brothers track

670
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,320
Speaker 5:  two new tracks with them and I listened to it and I Dolby Atmos room and

671
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,280
Speaker 5:  I had an era of 300 on top of the set of speaker. And I was playing around

672
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,360
Speaker 5:  with the first time I was playing around with a Dante, the, the, sorry, the

673
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,560
Speaker 5:  interface where, where we were, we were switching between the two. And actually

674
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,280
Speaker 5:  I kind of liked the central, like that immediacy you get from

675
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,920
Speaker 5:  300, the era of 300. It's like that's hitting me in the face like you did

676
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,040
Speaker 5:  today where you are absolutely right. Sometimes with space audio, you get

677
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,920
Speaker 5:  that feeling. It's like, wait a second, have I hit the stadium button? My,

678
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,760
Speaker 5:  when an hemp wait a second, I'm just, am I wading through

679
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,720
Speaker 5:  audio all of a sudden. It's, it's, it shouldn't be like that. And

680
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,040
Speaker 5:  that's the tricky thing is that we have to, as artists,

681
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,520
Speaker 5:  as record labels and as manufacturers of products,

682
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,760
Speaker 5:  we have to work on experience.

683
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,040
Speaker 2:  One of the, I would say more cynical criticisms of spatial

684
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,640
Speaker 2:  across the industry is, well, you know why Spotify can't do it, it's because

685
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,840
Speaker 2:  the rights to distributes spatial are more expensive and Apple and Amazon

686
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,800
Speaker 2:  are just paying the money. And spatial is a thing that you can hear. Right?

687
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,360
Speaker 2:  Yeah. You can't hear Lossless. I think we've all talked around the idea of

688
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,320
Speaker 2:  not being able to hear Lossless. Most people can't hear Lossless, especially

689
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,720
Speaker 2:  on their AirPods. Yeah. But as a format shift, is it something you could

690
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,040
Speaker 2:  charge higher rates for? Is something you could charge the consumer more

691
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:25,960
Speaker 2:  spatial is hearable in a way that could lead to different

692
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,800
Speaker 2:  rate structures? Has that been the background of your conversations about

693
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,440
Speaker 2:  why to support this format that the industry is doing this because it represents

694
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,360
Speaker 2:  a format shift from vinyl to cassettes to CD on the next thing? Or is

695
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,400
Speaker 2:  it there's actually something very meaningful here that improves the

696
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,720
Speaker 4:  Experience? It start, it started from the experience. Yeah. From you know,

697
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,520
Speaker 4:  where kind of where we are because you know, for us it's not,

698
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,560
Speaker 4:  you know, we're not involved in any of that part of it. Right. And so

699
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,600
Speaker 4:  from our perspective, yeah, yeah, partially. But that's not how he's paid.

700
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:55,280
Speaker 2:  No. But yeah,

701
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:59,600
Speaker 5:  He is. I mean, God I wish I was You wanna say,

702
00:38:59,600 --> 00:38:59,960
Speaker 5:  can

703
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Speaker 2:  You guess? I just wonder

704
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,320
Speaker 5:  If you can renegotiate my consultancy with the universe. I'd be delighted.

705
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:04,800
Speaker 2:  No,

706
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,200
Speaker 5:  But it's a,

707
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,000
Speaker 2:  It's about call.

708
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:11,080
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's a really valid point. But I think I

709
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,720
Speaker 5:  base things. It's funny when I, way back seven

710
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,680
Speaker 5:  years ago and I mixed Sergeant Pepper and Space Studio, there's been in my

711
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,240
Speaker 5:  David Arnold phone me up and said he went to a room and listened to it and

712
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,480
Speaker 5:  he went, it was the single most emotional audio experience he'd had.

713
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,920
Speaker 5:  I was like, wow, thanks David. And I then paid him. But the point

714
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,560
Speaker 5:  is, is that you can really touch what's, what's, you can travel through

715
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,200
Speaker 5:  space and time and that sounds crazy, but like I did this get back thing

716
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,120
Speaker 5:  with Peter Jackson last year, this Get Back series, and we did that

717
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,080
Speaker 5:  in spatial, but then a mixed letter B and I can put the room that

718
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,920
Speaker 5:  Paul McCartney was in while he sang the piano on the walls of your house.

719
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So he is in the room with you now you can talk about finance

720
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,720
Speaker 5:  and ecosystems and thing. That's why I do it. I do it.

721
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,160
Speaker 5:  So I can sit with Finns and Abbey Road

722
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,400
Speaker 5:  and he can talk to me about how he liked, you know, will I do this

723
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,120
Speaker 5:  mix in Atmos? And I you tried mixing Atmos and he then delivers like a cracking

724
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,960
Speaker 5:  We listen to Del Yeah. Like, like cracking mixes and atmos. And like

725
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,280
Speaker 5:  his engineer has an ear 300, which he uses reference. And that's, that's,

726
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,200
Speaker 5:  that's the, it's fun. You know, we do it. Why do I do it? Why do I

727
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,400
Speaker 5:  do this stuff with so much? It's fun. It's like super cool. It's fun.

728
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,280
Speaker 5:  Now Salian who is, you know, I respect,

729
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,280
Speaker 5:  you know, definitely respect, but it's like, that's not why I'd sit Patrick.

730
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,440
Speaker 5:  Listen Patrick, we need to look at this because, and then, you know, Patrick

731
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,840
Speaker 5:  Lister sat in the room we were sitting in today and go share this sound.

732
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,320
Speaker 5:  And it's like, and we with your daughter. I was like, check this out. It's

733
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,320
Speaker 5:  like, this is,

734
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,360
Speaker 2:  It's

735
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Speaker 5:  Amazing. You're not listening to cash registers. You listen to music.

736
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,080
Speaker 2:  Some people think they're listening to cash

737
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,680
Speaker 5:  Registers. Yeah, they, well they, they're not my friends.

738
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,120
Speaker 2:  It's weird that you can't, you mentioned Blu-Ray is a spatial

739
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,920
Speaker 2:  distribution format. I would say that as not a mainstream distribution format.

740
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I'm like very careful. Like I'm in room with you two and like a bunch

741
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,560
Speaker 2:  of virgin nerds. There's a lot of Blueray players in smallest

742
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,040
Speaker 5:  Vicinity here. Well, listen, listen, the question I got today for someone

743
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,760
Speaker 5:  quite angry was like, why do you not release Revolve in our on

744
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,120
Speaker 5:  Blueray?

745
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,000
Speaker 2:  You have to understand like our producers wanted to, like Andrew wants to

746
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,120
Speaker 2:  know

747
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,600
Speaker 5:  He wasn't question. That's we, we might do.

748
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:24,120
Speaker 2:  It's on a mainstream for, except for this room. It's

749
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,080
Speaker 2:  weird that you can't own a spatial audio track. You can't buy one

750
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,760
Speaker 2:  from Apple, you can't buy one from Amazon. It's all streaming all the time.

751
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,800
Speaker 2:  Right. Do is that just the nature of consumer preferences?

752
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,200
Speaker 5:  I think you can, Blu-rays are released.

753
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,280
Speaker 2:  So Blu-Ray is your answer. Yeah.

754
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, I How else, how else would you like to own it?

755
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,040
Speaker 2:  I would like to download a file. Like

756
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:45,960
Speaker 5:  It's download,

757
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Speaker 2:  There's something, there's something underneath all of this, right? Which

758
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,680
Speaker 2:  is like, as part of a consumer experience shift, there's a

759
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,520
Speaker 2:  business model shift. There is a, an ownership

760
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,600
Speaker 2:  shift. There's a underlying bet on streaming.

761
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,040
Speaker 2:  And to me, you know, like, I like to have my music, I'm serious

762
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,440
Speaker 2:  about it. And there's just a, there's a weirdness where it's like, I'm gonna

763
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,120
Speaker 2:  invest in this product from Sonos and to get the most out of it, I have to

764
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,160
Speaker 2:  pay Apple or Amazon for the rest of my life in order

765
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,000
Speaker 2:  to get the most value out of this product. And that just seems, it's, I

766
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,520
Speaker 2:  don't think it's in your control, but it seems like it's part of the change

767
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:21,680
Speaker 2:  here.

768
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,520
Speaker 5:  I think you'd argue the same thing about television. Yeah. You know, adolescence.

769
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,160
Speaker 5:  Like what if I,

770
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,360
Speaker 2:  Well you're the one bringing up Blueray. You

771
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,800
Speaker 5:  Brought up Blueray first. Mr. Blueray guy.

772
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,520
Speaker 5:  No, I think there's, I mean that is the, the nature of the beast now.

773
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:41,760
Speaker 5:  Of course. Like, you know, it's not down to us. He

774
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,160
Speaker 5:  says now talking about <unk> which I am,

775
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:48,120
Speaker 2:  I really lured you in here to, to put you in like an existential crisis.

776
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,800
Speaker 5:  Yeah. This is the welcome of my life. Luckily my family's standing by by

777
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,440
Speaker 5:  this difficult time. No, it's, it's, it's not down to,

778
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,240
Speaker 5:  it's not down to us. We, we deliver, you know, that analogy of like, you

779
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,320
Speaker 5:  know, the window in the world of sound, we deliver whatever's coming through.

780
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,560
Speaker 5:  And now if it's almost to download it, I think you can and you can download

781
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,060
Speaker 5:  HD tracks. I think maybe you, you know, I'm sure

782
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,060
Speaker 5:  it's funny. I'm sure that there'll be a stage you can download Atmo track.

783
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:12,380
Speaker 5:  Yes. I

784
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,220
Speaker 4:  I would think so too. But it, it is an interesting point to

785
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,540
Speaker 5:  Think about. Right. And I don't think that's a, I don't think that's a, I

786
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,140
Speaker 5:  don't think that, listen, going back to the previous conversation, your Honor,

787
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,380
Speaker 5:  about, about financial services, I'm sure that

788
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,140
Speaker 5:  if there's a, like HG Tracks Universal,

789
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,660
Speaker 5:  you know, we speaking Universal, we'd go, let's do a

790
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,700
Speaker 5:  deal where you, we are providing downloadable Atmos files for a subscription

791
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,860
Speaker 5:  fee and you can download them. That's not, I don't think that's a, that's

792
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,940
Speaker 5:  not a conversation. We've then that we have to work out the ecosystem of

793
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,540
Speaker 5:  storage. Well and

794
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:48,740
Speaker 2:  Started as a literal client servers model download. There's a

795
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:48,820
Speaker 2:  long

796
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,260
Speaker 5:  History here. You're right. And then we'd have to work at a system of, I

797
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,140
Speaker 5:  mean, open a can worms, rust link across the question of like

798
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:58,060
Speaker 5:  storage and then playing back from a library. So we touch you, we can do,

799
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,140
Speaker 5:  cause we, we test files that way. But

800
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,020
Speaker 2:  Yeah. From your perspective, Sonos runs a radio service. You've thought about

801
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,540
Speaker 2:  recurring revenue models and different kinds of descriptions. Is this something

802
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,300
Speaker 2:  that you would light up as well? Okay, we're gonna have a spatial service

803
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,100
Speaker 2:  or we're gonna need to invest in spatial versions of the radio service.

804
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,340
Speaker 4:  Absolutely. You know, I, I think we want to keep making sure that

805
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,460
Speaker 4:  Sonos Radio is there in terms of the best quality. We have the HD service

806
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:24,380
Speaker 4:  today, so we wanna make sure that we're there. And so that's something we're

807
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,620
Speaker 4:  definitely focused on for the future.

808
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,220
Speaker 2:  Do you think the Air 300 is a new product for Sonos is going to increase

809
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,480
Speaker 2:  the number of social audio listeners? Or do you think you think it's gonna

810
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,000
Speaker 2:  capture a rising trend of people using spatial on their headphones?

811
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:39,080
Speaker 4:  I believe this is a moment where there's

812
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,720
Speaker 4:  enough energy from the streaming services, from the

813
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,400
Speaker 4:  labels and then with this product that it's going to bring

814
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,000
Speaker 4:  spatial to a whole new set of people. That's why we're doing it.

815
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,880
Speaker 4:  Because we feel like we want to introduce them to spacial in the right way

816
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,360
Speaker 4:  and this is the right way to do it. And so I do expect a whole bunch of people

817
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,720
Speaker 4:  to experience spatial the first time with Air 300.

818
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,760
Speaker 5:  And there's been an interesting shift, sorry to button on, on age groups

819
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,600
Speaker 5:  and listenership in spatial audio, which we see through the record industry

820
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,400
Speaker 5:  of people, you know, leaning in and listening and a new

821
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,040
Speaker 5:  generation of listeners listening to even old catalog. Like there's been

822
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,160
Speaker 5:  a huge boost in, and I think they're gonna wanna know what it sounds like

823
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,120
Speaker 5:  out loud. And the weird thing is that is, until now, I don't

824
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,600
Speaker 5:  believe, you know, there are niche systems, but I think the 300, the era

825
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,480
Speaker 5:  300 does provide, you know, I know it does. From a, from the working

826
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,400
Speaker 5:  with creator and the creator town, it provides a very real Yeah. Way of experiencing

827
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,080
Speaker 5:  it. And I've found personally that I've really

828
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,440
Speaker 5:  enjoying like, exploring music on it. You know, that's the thing. It's like,

829
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,880
Speaker 5:  what a second? You know, it's Miles Davis. It's like, this is cool.

830
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:48,440
Speaker 5:  It's like he's in my room. I mean, you know, I'm not sure I want Miles Davis

831
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,880
Speaker 5:  in my room, you know, for a long period of time. It's kind of crazy, but

832
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,440
Speaker 5:  it's like, this is great. Know

833
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,560
Speaker 2:  I'm excited for our headline to be in Charles Martin calls HomePod a Niche

834
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,840
Speaker 2:  system. That's gonna be great.

835
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,040
Speaker 5:  That was very clever. Don't

836
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,360
Speaker 14:  Say anything.

837
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,800
Speaker 2:  We're gonna take one more break and then I'm asking Patrick Spence about

838
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,600
Speaker 2:  the future of Sonos and its products.

839
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,820
Speaker 14:  Hey, it's Newel King, co-host of today, explained here. Bye Now. You've

840
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,540
Speaker 14:  heard about Scott Adams, the Dilbert creator and interpreter of polling

841
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:16,780
Speaker 14:  data.

842
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:21,220
Speaker 15:  Well, Rasmussen Poll had a provocative little poll today.

843
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:25,180
Speaker 15:  They said, do you agree or disagree with a statement?

844
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,820
Speaker 15:  It's okay to be white.

845
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,220
Speaker 14:  Who spent a career building a comic empire.

846
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:33,260
Speaker 16:  It spoke to so many people. It was the comic strip that you would

847
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,580
Speaker 16:  see push pinned onto cubicle walls as sort of

848
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:41,180
Speaker 16:  the corporate culture was changing. We needed humor to

849
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:45,020
Speaker 16:  survive that time. And Scott hit it perfectly,

850
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:48,780
Speaker 14:  Then got pulled from newspapers after a racist tirade. So many questions,

851
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,340
Speaker 14:  including why is Rasmussen asking people if it's okay to be white?

852
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:56,460
Speaker 17:  It's a really weird thing to ask people. And to

853
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,420
Speaker 17:  be honest, I haven't heard a good explanation for why,

854
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,780
Speaker 14:  But we found answers today. Explained, it's in your feed every weekday at

855
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,180
Speaker 14:  2:00 PM

856
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:13,080
Speaker 18:  There's a new season of you out on Netflix. And the show's lead

857
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:17,080
Speaker 18:  says this season he did fewer sex scenes to

858
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,160
Speaker 18:  protect his real life marriage.

859
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,320
Speaker 19:  Meryl Streep's been married a long time. Do I think that every time

860
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,280
Speaker 19:  she's kissed somebody or had sex in a movie, she thinks, I can't believe

861
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,480
Speaker 19:  I get to cheat on my husband right now just so I can win an Oscar. Like

862
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:30,760
Speaker 19:  no,

863
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,240
Speaker 18:  You and the state of sex on screen plus the writer

864
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,040
Speaker 18:  of Cocaine, bear on Cocaine Bear this

865
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,880
Speaker 18:  week on Intuit Vultures Pop culture podcast.

866
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:51,680
Speaker 2:  Okay, I'm back with Patrick Spence and Giles Martin. There have

867
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,160
Speaker 2:  more niche systems in the home pod. So nice. Make Soundbars, right? There's

868
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,120
Speaker 2:  a lot of soundbar atmos in this world. There are ways to get Atmos

869
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,600
Speaker 2:  audio into Soundbars. What do you think the difference is if you've got a

870
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,560
Speaker 2:  514 soundbar set up at home or whatever, is this a meaningful

871
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:10,120
Speaker 2:  upgrade over that? Is it going to be different because it's focused on music

872
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,440
Speaker 2:  first?

873
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,200
Speaker 5:  Well, listen, we, I mean it's been great that ARC has been used as a reference

874
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,600
Speaker 5:  system in studios. I mean, there's, there's an arc and capital. There's an

875
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,000
Speaker 5:  arc and happy road. There's an arc in, you know, we have, we, we've been

876
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,800
Speaker 5:  saying a lot of reference for, for Atmos Music Ark is the main,

877
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,160
Speaker 5:  has been the main reference. Once pros, you know, we start off when we're,

878
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,120
Speaker 5:  when we're doing it, when we're doing home theory, we actually start off

879
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,680
Speaker 5:  with music. Cuz music is much more fragile than home theater. He says

880
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,800
Speaker 5:  Arrogantly being more music. But I actually mix, I mixed film, so I, sorry,

881
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,560
Speaker 5:  I can say that, but you know, you can, there's much more of a,

882
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:44,000
Speaker 5:  a fragility to music. If a song goes wrong, you hear it more than a, than

883
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,440
Speaker 5:  a film soundtrack going wrong. And Ark has been used for that, but it's not

884
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,440
Speaker 5:  built for that. It's a home theater system first. And by

885
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,120
Speaker 5:  its fit and form, it has to be by it being a, a tube, if you like,

886
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:59,400
Speaker 5:  to be frank. So yeah, it's like, you know, would I listen to, I

887
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,080
Speaker 5:  personally listen to an Atmos track on Arc, which has been used as a reference

888
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,600
Speaker 5:  system for or for or on ERA 300? Era 300

889
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,840
Speaker 5:  without question, you know, but watching movies arc is great,

890
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,120
Speaker 2:  But that is sort of the default at most experience for most people right

891
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,920
Speaker 2:  now. Whether it's the Arc or another soundbar. Yeah. Is it worth saying I

892
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,880
Speaker 2:  need to put an Air 300 in this room as well?

893
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think people, I think people hear it and, and they say yes, it is.

894
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:26,040
Speaker 5:  I think the way that, the way the Air 300, and you heard it today even

895
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,080
Speaker 5:  in the curtain room where we, we asked what, what trickery we are up to.

896
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:33,240
Speaker 5:  I think that the spacial aspect of the, the way it

897
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,640
Speaker 5:  projects discreet audio, which it sounds very real. It's not blurred like

898
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,440
Speaker 5:  a guitar can be on your far right side. Sounds like a guitar. It's kind of

899
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,960
Speaker 5:  amazing, I think. Yeah, I mean, I'd I'd have one. I have one and

900
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,720
Speaker 4:  I think it's the simplicity too, just like, you know, it's a speaker, you

901
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,280
Speaker 4:  know, what's there, you know, it's for music in terms of what's there. The,

902
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,240
Speaker 4:  the, there still is a, seems to be a mental barrier for many people in terms

903
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,680
Speaker 4:  of listening to music in their home theater kind of setup. Right. And so

904
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,480
Speaker 4:  it's another room. Is it the kitchen, a living room, a sitting room, an office,

905
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,160
Speaker 4:  wherever it's going to be. But there's something that screams music

906
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,120
Speaker 4:  about the era 300. Yeah.

907
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,480
Speaker 2:  This is the part where I just start asking you for new products directly.

908
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,400
Speaker 2:  Patrick, where is my receiver with Sonas built in and True play built? Did

909
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,480
Speaker 4:  You see our works with Sona, with Sony that we did the works with Sonos work

910
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,920
Speaker 4:  on their receiver. So there you go.

911
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,080
Speaker 2:  But I still gotta buy another thing I want, I want you to make it, I want

912
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,920
Speaker 2:  you to be responsible for

913
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,840
Speaker 4:  It's, if I can get your updated list, I'm happy to take your updated

914
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,320
Speaker 2:  List. It's still I do, I do feel like I need to end by sort of asking more

915
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,840
Speaker 2:  expansively about Sonos. Yep. Right. There's a big split. Now

916
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,120
Speaker 2:  I listened to your last earnings call before the era 300 was announced. Speaking

917
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,040
Speaker 2:  of the HomePod, you were basically like, yeah, big tech stopped competing

918
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,280
Speaker 2:  with us. There's like nothing on the market that competes with us for a minute

919
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,480
Speaker 2:  there. That seemed like an existential threat, right? The, the big tech players

920
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,200
Speaker 2:  are coming, they were locking the streaming services to various products.

921
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:51,840
Speaker 2:  Why do you think that threat has passed? And do you, do you see a sort of

922
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,760
Speaker 2:  resurgent moment for Sonos right now?

923
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,520
Speaker 4:  Absolutely. See a resurgent moment, you only have to look at our holiday

924
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:00,440
Speaker 4:  results. And if you look at what happened over that period, there just wasn't,

925
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,440
Speaker 4:  as I said, a lot interesting happening in the space, right. From anyone,

926
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,120
Speaker 4:  quite frankly where whether legacy or big tech side of it. And so

927
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,640
Speaker 4:  we've always been very focused on how we build this for the long term in

928
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,520
Speaker 4:  a sustainable way. We didn't get caught up in some of the hype around, you

929
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,120
Speaker 4:  know, voice gonna be, voice is gonna be the next, you know, mobile operating

930
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:21,040
Speaker 4:  system speaker. Exactly. And I think, I think we live in a day and

931
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,920
Speaker 4:  age where very quickly people's attention turn to the new, new thing.

932
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:28,920
Speaker 4:  We get all fired up about it. It dominates the headlines for three,

933
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,840
Speaker 4:  six months. You, I mean, whether it's voice or whether it's crypto, or

934
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,840
Speaker 4:  whether it's web three or whether it's now ai,

935
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,360
Speaker 2:  Bitcoins on the

936
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,880
Speaker 4:  Speakers, right? And, and so you're Not taking, don't suggestions and, and

937
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,840
Speaker 4:  we, we don't, we try to be, we try to think about what do these things mean

938
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,560
Speaker 4:  for consumers as you think about it, you know, a decade long period. And

939
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,360
Speaker 4:  we continue to innovate in terms of what you see with

940
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,280
Speaker 4:  the ERA 300 and the ERA 100, but products that are gonna last for a long

941
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,080
Speaker 4:  time. And it's never, it's never with an ulterior motive of trying to

942
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:01,880
Speaker 4:  capture your data or sell you another service or all of these things.

943
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,800
Speaker 4:  And so I think our, you know, clarity of what we do and why we do it,

944
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,080
Speaker 4:  you know, has helped serve us well in competing with, you know, strong legacy

945
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,920
Speaker 4:  audio brands that we had to come from nowhere to, you know,

946
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,120
Speaker 4:  be in the position we are today. And then even when Big Tech jumped in and

947
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,640
Speaker 4:  infringed all of our intellectual property, we could still keep

948
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,440
Speaker 4:  innovating, keep competing, keep growing, and make sure that we would come

949
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,680
Speaker 4:  out stronger. So I think it's a testament to our focus and our commitment

950
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,160
Speaker 4:  to doing what we do really, really well. And I think it shows you that, you

951
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,280
Speaker 4:  know, hopefully it gives hope to other companies that, you know, just because

952
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:38,360
Speaker 4:  big tech's gonna jump into your space doesn't mean you should, you

953
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,120
Speaker 4:  know, follow what they're doing necessarily. Like if we had, if we had built

954
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:44,800
Speaker 4:  a, you know, 25 or $50 speaker, I think that would've been a huge

955
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,360
Speaker 4:  mistake, right? And we, and you and I talked about that before. I don't think

956
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,640
Speaker 4:  you respond in that way. You look at where your strengths are, what you need

957
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,560
Speaker 4:  to do, and how do you compete uniquely in that situation and build on your

958
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,480
Speaker 4:  strengths. And ERA 300 is a perfect example of building on our strengths

959
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,200
Speaker 4:  and going after that. And so hopefully this is a bit of a, you know, a

960
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:05,480
Speaker 4:  inspiration to others that are building their companies and want to compete

961
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,440
Speaker 4:  in an era where we know it's been very difficult with big tech coming in

962
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,400
Speaker 4:  and, you know, jumping into all these new categories.

963
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:15,440
Speaker 2:  The last time I spoke to you, you did not have the head of sound experience.

964
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,120
Speaker 2:  You had your lawyer, you had your general counsel with you, and we talked

965
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,720
Speaker 2:  about the big tech lawsuit. Yeah. Thank God it wasn't me is all I can say.

966
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:25,160
Speaker 2:  I think honestly, you guys should switch spots. Yeah, yeah. He's

967
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,640
Speaker 5:  Great on sound. But Eddie is, Eddie

968
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,440
Speaker 2:  Is Eddie is like, what did love, yeah. How many speakers has the lawyer

969
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,160
Speaker 2:  put up before, is it 7,000? Yeah, but no, how, how is the Google lawsuit

970
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,080
Speaker 2:  going? Are you closer to a resolution? We saw the antitrust bills in Congress

971
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,280
Speaker 2:  sort of come to nothing. Yeah. What's going on there?

972
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:44,440
Speaker 4:  So the spring we have the northern District case, you know,

973
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,040
Speaker 4:  happening. And so we'll see how that all plays out in the fall. We have the

974
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,560
Speaker 4:  Southern District case, which is a, the federal circuit off the back of the

975
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:55,600
Speaker 4:  ITC that we won very handily. So these things continue to progress through

976
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,360
Speaker 4:  the courts. We're 10 for 10 against Google in terms of their

977
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:03,320
Speaker 4:  frivolous actions against us to distract and make us spend, you

978
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,440
Speaker 4:  know, money. So we feel good about where we stand

979
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,440
Speaker 4:  today and we're gonna keep fighting for our intellectual property and you

980
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,360
Speaker 4:  know, if people infringe it, we're going to work with

981
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,080
Speaker 4:  them first. But if they, you know, don't come to the table as Google

982
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,960
Speaker 4:  didn't, then we will take it to the courts and, and we, you know, are

983
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,760
Speaker 4:  in a position thankfully because of a lot of hard work and, and everybody's

984
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,400
Speaker 4:  efforts where we are in control of our own destiny. And we can do that. And

985
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,360
Speaker 4:  I feel that it's important for all the inventors at Sonos, but I also feel

986
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,320
Speaker 4:  it's important for society that we stand up

987
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,880
Speaker 4:  in these situations and say, no, you can't go and infringe what somebody

988
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,400
Speaker 4:  else does. And so I have faith that the, you know, the

989
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,480
Speaker 4:  courts will ultimately help us and will prevail

990
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:51,440
Speaker 2:  Across the spectrum of big tech. It's actually kind of inconsistent how they're

991
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,320
Speaker 2:  supporting this next standard. Apple and Amazon are doing it. Google is

992
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,280
Speaker 2:  not doing it. Spotify, I think most notably is not supporting

993
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,240
Speaker 2:  it yet for any number of reasons. They actually announced like HiFi two

994
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,080
Speaker 2:  years ago. That's right. Today on the day that we're talking and it's come

995
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,960
Speaker 2:  to nothing, are those conversations you're having like, Hey, we're going

996
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,320
Speaker 2:  ahead with spatial audio, this is the future of music. Are you coming along

997
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,560
Speaker 2:  for the ride or are they just missing out?

998
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:18,200
Speaker 4:  We, we've definitely been out there talking to all of the streaming

999
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,800
Speaker 4:  services trying to rally everyone around this because we believe it will

1000
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,800
Speaker 4:  be the future. And people just work on, you know, they have their own roadmaps

1001
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,160
Speaker 4:  and timelines and strategic priorities and all of those things, but making

1002
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,000
Speaker 4:  the mistake, we've been out there absolutely letting them know Air 300 s

1003
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,440
Speaker 4:  coming, trying to get their support, make sure we're all lined up. So yeah,

1004
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:34,960
Speaker 4:  we'll keep doing

1005
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,760
Speaker 5:  That. And I think again, experience and and consumer reaction

1006
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,600
Speaker 5:  will, will, will decide as well. Sure. I mean also, you know, automotive,

1007
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,640
Speaker 5:  which you know, is becoming bigger and special audio and I think,

1008
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:49,480
Speaker 2:  Do you see the Mercedes eClass announced today with Yeah. Built in spatial

1009
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,240
Speaker 2:  Did you, did you do the TikTok camera?

1010
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:53,600
Speaker 5:  I didn't do the TikTok

1011
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,480
Speaker 2:  Camera. So it has a selfie camera inside of it. You make tos while the car

1012
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,360
Speaker 2:  drives itself. This is the entire future of all media is my, is my, this

1013
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,800
Speaker 5:  Is, this is becoming desperate. Yeah.

1014
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,480
Speaker 2:  The headline was like, supports ATMO from Apple Music and the

1015
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,000
Speaker 2:  sub-headline was selfie camera for tos. And I was like, we should flip those.

1016
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:15,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we are, we are not putting a selfie cameras for TikTok in anywhere.

1017
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:20,960
Speaker 2:  No, but but you think it's coming to cars, right? I mean every car is had

1018
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,440
Speaker 2:  sort of like a fake surround,

1019
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,800
Speaker 5:  I think again, the experience has to be good, you know, that's it. It's like,

1020
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,960
Speaker 5:  and that's the thing about spatial is that, you know, if you, if it's done

1021
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,840
Speaker 5:  right, which I think we've done, then it's a really compelling, it's a really

1022
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,040
Speaker 5:  compelling experience and I think companies will get it right, not just us.

1023
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,160
Speaker 5:  And that will then shift the consumer

1024
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:44,080
Speaker 5:  experience and therefore that will influence people like Spotify will then,

1025
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,680
Speaker 5:  you know, have to come to the table.

1026
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:49,560
Speaker 2:  Do you think there's gonna be a wave of overly

1027
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,520
Speaker 2:  aggressive atmo mixes in this period? Because that's

1028
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,200
Speaker 2:  what I'm, that's what I

1029
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,320
Speaker 5:  See. Aggressive atmos mixes, like, you know, people throwing things at studio

1030
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,280
Speaker 5:  walls and stuff like

1031
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,520
Speaker 2:  That. Yeah. Just like the guitars are over by the bar unreasonable.

1032
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,280
Speaker 5:  Well it's interesting cuz in lockdown I was sort of overseeing

1033
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,640
Speaker 5:  spacial audio for and quality control with, with a team of

1034
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,240
Speaker 5:  like 50 engineers that were, you know, it was, it was like mixing,

1035
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,920
Speaker 5:  mixing, mixing, mixing and yeah, I mean there were times where it was just

1036
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,600
Speaker 5:  like, it's like early stereo, you know? Yeah. Early stereo was

1037
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,480
Speaker 5:  crazy. And absolutely, I think it settled down, you know, you know,

1038
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,680
Speaker 5:  I'm hearing people do mixes now, which are just truly outstanding

1039
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,600
Speaker 5:  and not advanced as far as spatial goes. They just sound good. And

1040
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,120
Speaker 5:  that's the point, you know? Okay. You, you, I mean, I know from experience,

1041
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:38,920
Speaker 5:  I mean, I've just done, you know, a whole load of big artists Namos,

1042
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,560
Speaker 5:  something like the Stones or the Beatles, Loren Stones. You, you don't,

1043
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,280
Speaker 5:  Angie, you don't want things flying around your head. It's like acoustic

1044
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,160
Speaker 5:  guitar strings and drums and bass and vocal chemical brothers. You want things

1045
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,600
Speaker 5:  flying around your head and going through you and hitting you in the face

1046
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,400
Speaker 5:  and all that sort of stuff. Yeah. So I think it's, it's music dependent.

1047
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:59,240
Speaker 5:  And that's the great thing about building like an era 300 is that then you

1048
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,680
Speaker 5:  should then have that product that realizes that in your space.

1049
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:06,720
Speaker 5:  So for instance, I can put Paul McCarney back in Abbey Road singing

1050
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,840
Speaker 5:  Abbey Road and the walls of every rip comes the wall walls of your home.

1051
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,480
Speaker 5:  That's super exciting. That's like really compelling. The chemical brothers,

1052
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,040
Speaker 5:  you're at Coachella or whatever, it's, you know, so that's just

1053
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,440
Speaker 5:  one creator. There are people who are doing amazing things, space shorty,

1054
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,320
Speaker 5:  and you talk to creators. We did a, we did a panel in Santa Barbara with

1055
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,160
Speaker 5:  a bunch of careers. It was really interesting. And like Manny Marquin who

1056
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,400
Speaker 5:  mixes just about everything now, he was like talking about how it freed him

1057
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,560
Speaker 5:  up, how spatial it frees him up to thinking about he's, you know, he has

1058
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,120
Speaker 5:  to put, you know, mixing Lizzo or something like that. He's having to put

1059
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,360
Speaker 5:  everything in his into speakers and now he can open it out. And we just have

1060
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,680
Speaker 5:  to represent that in the home.

1061
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:45,800
Speaker 2:  I was definitely complaining about spatial with somebody who knows and they

1062
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,560
Speaker 2:  said, what are you doing? Listen, Totto. And I listened totto and I thought

1063
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,680
Speaker 2:  this would be amazing if I was on drugs. And that's like the highlight. Yeah.

1064
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,560
Speaker 2:  It was not yet on drugs. Yeah. Yet I wanna end here. You are the

1065
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,600
Speaker 2:  expert trials. I, there's no way I could offer this instruction to our audience.

1066
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,440
Speaker 2:  So I wanna ask you for it. We're about to come into a wave of

1067
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,200
Speaker 2:  hyper on spatial audio, right? This is, I would say the air 100 is the,

1068
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:09,600
Speaker 2:  the tip of the iceberg in terms of product launches, in terms of hyper on

1069
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,680
Speaker 2:  this stuff. In terms of listening at home on not a soundbar,

1070
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:16,520
Speaker 2:  what should people be listening for? How do you listen intelligently to a

1071
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,240
Speaker 2:  spatial mix to know that it's any good? It's a, because I think right now

1072
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,960
Speaker 2:  everything is just like, like what if it was all around you and I, that doesn't,

1073
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,320
Speaker 2:  that doesn't seem like the right answer.

1074
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:27,480
Speaker 5:  Listen to your heart is what I

1075
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,360
Speaker 2:  Would say. Yeah, we're done here. That's, no,

1076
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,680
Speaker 5:  You know what, you know what, you can dismiss that. But like, you can

1077
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,280
Speaker 5:  sit there but, and honestly it's, and it's, and listens from someone who

1078
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,040
Speaker 5:  has to analyze sound and like, I have

1079
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,520
Speaker 5:  all of this opinion. There's nothing better than someone putting on music

1080
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,840
Speaker 5:  and you've being with a friend, listening to it. And it's another question.

1081
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:50,840
Speaker 5:  So in space audio, you can close your eyes and you can think about

1082
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,680
Speaker 5:  where everything is, how your room. And this is why I love, don't think about

1083
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,320
Speaker 5:  the speak you're listening to. Think about the song you're listening to.

1084
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:01,560
Speaker 5:  And technically for a bunch of different reasons, we can achieve that

1085
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,520
Speaker 5:  in the artist space and the product space a lot better with special audio

1086
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,280
Speaker 5:  because we can project sound and because we have channels of projection.

1087
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,000
Speaker 5:  You know, spatial audio is mal channel, stereo is two channel, mono is one

1088
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,680
Speaker 5:  channel. We have this channel camera, we can actually project

1089
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,560
Speaker 5:  color on the walls of your home. And that's what you listen listener listen

1090
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:24,600
Speaker 5:  to. But bubble else, just see whether you enjoy it, see whether

1091
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,840
Speaker 5:  you dig it. And that's the thing. And it's really interesting. Sometimes

1092
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,160
Speaker 5:  you listen to a track and you go, this isn't very spatial, but I'm enjoying

1093
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,200
Speaker 5:  it. It doesn't have to be wide for you to enjoy it.

1094
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:37,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And answer it. What's your favorite spatial track?

1095
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,040
Speaker 4:  The one I heard from Finns today is, oh my gosh, was incredible. What,

1096
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:45,720
Speaker 4:  I don't know what the name of it is, but it was, it's a new one that Phineas

1097
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,600
Speaker 4:  just did. And it is, oh, you've gotta hear it because you feel it. I think

1098
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,320
Speaker 4:  that's the thing to me is you absolutely

1099
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,960
Speaker 5:  Feel it concert five years from now

1100
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,840
Speaker 4:  Concert five years from now. You feel it when you're there and it, it feels

1101
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,240
Speaker 4:  like you're somewhere else. Which, you know, I, I'm, I've been in tech long

1102
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,840
Speaker 4:  enough to be cynical about all these things and I really do think Giles nailed

1103
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,160
Speaker 4:  it with do you feel it fundamentally? And when you close your eyes, what

1104
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,240
Speaker 4:  does that feel like? And you know, for what we do, that's about as good as

1105
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:10,560
Speaker 4:  it gets.

1106
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well, Patrick Giles, thank you so much for trying us say, this is great.

1107
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,760
Speaker 2:  Thank you. We probably talk to you about special audio for another five hours,

1108
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,120
Speaker 5:  But I can come back later on

1109
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,040
Speaker 2:  Between the Beatles fans Losing their minds and Your Coms, people lose their

1110
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,440
Speaker 2:  minds. It's time to go. I'll get

1111
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,720
Speaker 5:  The blue rays done guys. Okay, I'll get, I'll

1112
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,960
Speaker 20:  Meet them for you. You can just have Blue Rays. So now on.

1113
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:27,800
Speaker 2:  Amazing. That was great. Thank

1114
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:27,880
Speaker 20:  You.

1115
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:31,480
Speaker 2:  That's it for the VER Has today. Thank you for listening. There's a lot more

1116
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,200
Speaker 2:  from this conversation@theverge.com. There are links in the show notes, including

1117
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,440
Speaker 2:  lots of links to Chris Welch's coverage. These are only leading the charge

1118
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:41,120
Speaker 2:  scooping these speakers. If you have thoughts, feedback, feelings, tips,
