14
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,200
Speaker 3:  you that I am working on finding a sponsor for.

15
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,920
Speaker 3:  There's one I have in particular in my brain, starts

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,880
Speaker 3:  with a eh and ends in a tell. If you are listening

17
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,520
Speaker 3:  and you're from one of America's most important ship makers,

18
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,880
Speaker 3:  call our people. I don't do any of that side of the, the, that's, that's

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,280
Speaker 3:  the other side of the house. But they're waiting to catch your money and

20
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,440
Speaker 3:  rebrand this The Vergecast Thunderbolt four round, sponsored by

21
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,720
Speaker 3:  You. know what I'm saying? Yeah. Anyway, so show of Lightning Arts. There's

22
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,360
Speaker 3:  a lot of news. We gotta get through it all. Yeah. But before we begin, I

23
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,240
Speaker 3:  want to, I want to shout out to two listeners who I would like to give t-shirts

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,960
Speaker 3:  to. One, I literally just ran into me on a train today, looked

25
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,600
Speaker 3:  surprised. Said they were a big fan, and I forgot to say, gimme your email

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,680
Speaker 3:  address. So just send me an email. Tell me what your name was on the train

27
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,840
Speaker 3:  platform and I'll make sure you get a t-shirt. I'm not saying their name

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,240
Speaker 3:  because I want, that's my verification scheme.

29
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,520
Speaker 3:  So the second one is more, a little more of a story and is truly one

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,680
Speaker 3:  of the funniest moments that I've ever had hosting the show. Okay.

31
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,320
Speaker 3:  Which is 10 years now.

32
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,880
Speaker 3:  So we are in New York. Like lots of people just expect to

33
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,640
Speaker 3:  see people in New York. It's like a, a normal thing that happens is

34
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,320
Speaker 3:  someone's like, Hey, ver the The Verge. Yeah. You're a guy.

35
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,520
Speaker 3:  I'm super mad at you about head fun jacks and like, we're off to the races.

36
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,040
Speaker 3:  Right. We

37
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,480
Speaker 5:  Should say, by the way, that that is what 95% of people say when they meet

38
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,080
Speaker 5:  one of us. They just go The Verge.

39
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:15,600
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

40
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,120
Speaker 3:  It's like a real thing. Look, there are creators who are vastly more

41
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,400
Speaker 3:  popular than we are. Yeah. So we're, we're, we're down here. But one of the

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,560
Speaker 3:  best aspects of this is because it's a podcast and people have been listening

43
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,200
Speaker 3:  to us for so long, people just come up to us and start talking to us. Like

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,120
Speaker 3:  they, they know us. Yeah. And often whoever's partner is like, do You

45
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,080
Speaker 3:  know each other? And I'm like, no. And that's, it's

46
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,440
Speaker 3:  always very funny. So I, I appreciate this. Happy to talk to whoever at any

47
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,880
Speaker 3:  time, but I'm saying in New York that's normal 'cause people know that we're

48
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,400
Speaker 3:  in New York. Like Right. You have some baseline expectation that we're at

49
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,080
Speaker 3:  least supposed to be in this city or at an Apple event or whatever. It's,

50
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,960
Speaker 3:  I was in Boston this week where Harvard is

51
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,920
Speaker 3:  launching something called the Applied Social Media Lab. And it's a

52
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,680
Speaker 3:  big fancy event and big fancy people and You know it's like a launch.

53
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,360
Speaker 3:  There's panel interviews and da dah dah dah, dah. And how can we help social

54
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
Speaker 3:  media reinforce democracy? Like Neli stuff, You know

55
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,120
Speaker 3:  the stuff. And So I was there.

56
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,560
Speaker 4:  The stuff

57
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,920
Speaker 3:  And You know at, at the event watched the thing. We did a decoder episode

58
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,840
Speaker 3:  with Larry Las Vegas all great. But like eight 15

59
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,680
Speaker 3:  in the morning, I met Walgreens in Cambridge. And a

60
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,360
Speaker 3:  Vergecast fan just looked like utterly perplexed.

61
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,080
Speaker 3:  As I'm walking into the Walgreens, they walked up to me and the very politely

62
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,360
Speaker 3:  and all the, they had headphones in and they were listening to the last episode

63
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
Speaker 3:  of the Sonos episode. Whoa. And all this person could do was just like, point

64
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,320
Speaker 3:  at their phone. They were just like, that's you.

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,920
Speaker 3:  I was like, yeah, it's me. And then they said their name, So I.

66
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,720
Speaker 3:  Thank you for listening. I'm sorry. But I was like not supposed to be in

67
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,120
Speaker 3:  Boston. Like I could see the, like Yeah. It was just like

68
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,000
Speaker 3:  unwired. Like why is this person here? And I get it. 'cause why was I there

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,600
Speaker 3:  at eight 15 in the morning at Walgreens? This poor person was gonna work.

70
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,040
Speaker 3:  Send me an email. Say your name. I I remember your name. We'll get you a

71
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,960
Speaker 3:  t-shirt. It was just like one of the purely funniest moments. Like, it's

72
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,640
Speaker 3:  like, honestly, like why was I there? Yeah. There's no explanation. I had

73
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,480
Speaker 3:  not tweeted I'm in Boston. Like nothing. Just context free. See, a person

74
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,320
Speaker 3:  that you're listening to must've been truly strange. So send me an email

75
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,840
Speaker 3:  with your name and I'll send you a t-shirt. Is is

76
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,000
Speaker 5:  It because of your tremendous brand loyalty to Dwayne Reed that no one could

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,880
Speaker 5:  believe you would ever

78
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,640
Speaker 3:  You know Walgreens.

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,280
Speaker 4:  C v s.

80
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,040
Speaker 3:  So yeah, there's two, there's two T-shirts I wanna send out. If you saw me

81
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,520
Speaker 3:  on the train today or if you saw me randomly in Boston,

82
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,760
Speaker 3:  which again, truly random situation. I like

83
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,840
Speaker 4:  That they didn't point at you because that's what I do when I see someone.

84
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,920
Speaker 4:  No, it was, I just point,

85
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,080
Speaker 3:  It was, it was showing me the, the activity widget on their iPhone

86
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,400
Speaker 3:  home screen way more point. Like just really got me like I would've done

87
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,760
Speaker 3:  the same thing. Yeah. Like if I, if I was like, I don't know, watching Red

88
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,000
Speaker 3:  Zone on my phone and Scott Hanson was there, like all I would've done is

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
Speaker 3:  just like point at my phone against

90
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:03,600
Speaker 5:  You.

91
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,720
Speaker 3:  That's you,

92
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,480
Speaker 3:  you're

93
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,440
Speaker 5:  There and here at the same time. Wait, Neli, before we move

94
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,200
Speaker 5:  on, I have a really important question. Yeah. How many gadgets did you bring

95
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,760
Speaker 5:  on the train today? I cannot tell you the response that we have gotten

96
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,080
Speaker 5:  to your thesis that you would like to be the guy who just walks under the

97
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,160
Speaker 5:  train like a murderer with

98
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,920
Speaker 3:  Nothing. Yeah. Nothing.

99
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,040
Speaker 5:  The number of emails and posts. We got so much response to this being like,

100
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,880
Speaker 5:  this is the way Yeah.

101
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,840
Speaker 3:  This is all anybody wants to do.

102
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,960
Speaker 5:  Have you made progress? How are we doing So

103
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,120
Speaker 3:  I since that episode, I had not been back in the office,

104
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,640
Speaker 3:  so my plan was to sneak into the office reviews closet today and see

105
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,520
Speaker 3:  if we have a galaxy fold with decks. Mm. And I was

106
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,920
Speaker 3:  gonna give it a shot in the, the coming week.

107
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,640
Speaker 5:  Okay.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,200
Speaker 3:  'cause I, I'm, I'm commuting in the office like two or three times a week.

109
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,680
Speaker 3:  So, I'm gonna give it a shot one of these days. Okay.

110
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,600
Speaker 3:  This requires like an enormous amount of upfront work as

111
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,400
Speaker 3:  all assassinations require. Just a lot of planning and

112
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,240
Speaker 3:  preparation. I have to set up a Dex Workstation in the

113
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,120
Speaker 3:  office, which is like perhaps not the best use of my

114
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,320
Speaker 3:  time in the office.

115
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,760
Speaker 4:  I'm sure that it can help

116
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,480
Speaker 3:  You. No, no, no, no. That's not a ticket you wanna file. Hello?

117
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,360
Speaker 3:  I would like to put an unvetted third party operating system on this

118
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,600
Speaker 3:  network.

119
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,240
Speaker 4:  That's fine.

120
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:23,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

121
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,040
Speaker 3:  Just can I, can I full access to the land? Please.

122
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,200
Speaker 3:  You've never heard of this operating system. It runs on a phone.

123
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,600
Speaker 3:  We don't even own You know. I gotta do some prep work, which

124
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,440
Speaker 3:  I'll attempt to do today. Yeah. Okay. I don't know why in

125
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,000
Speaker 3:  my head this has to be a folding phone.

126
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,080
Speaker 4:  No, I'm, it makes sense.

127
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,280
Speaker 5:  Right? It makes like a regular

128
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,920
Speaker 4:  Phone's not, but like

129
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,840
Speaker 3:  Many Samsung phones run decks

130
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,720
Speaker 5:  But not as well. It's for the reading on the train, right? Yeah. Like it's,

131
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,640
Speaker 5:  it's like you want, you want the something to like sit down on the seat

132
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,400
Speaker 5:  and You know cross your legs into your crossword puzzle. Like that's the,

133
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,120
Speaker 5:  that's the interim stage. That's where you open the phone.

134
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,120
Speaker 3:  That's right. But there's no part of, I'm not bringing up my laptop on the

135
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,640
Speaker 3:  train. I'm just using my phone. Yeah. Shut

136
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,760
Speaker 5:  Up. It doesn't matter. I don't,

137
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,280
Speaker 3:  I don't have the middle ground between phone usage and laptop usage.

138
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,040
Speaker 5:  It's 'cause you don't have a foldable phone. I don't understand. This is

139
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,240
Speaker 5:  it.

140
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,560
Speaker 3:  The other side of it is, at my house, I have to set up an always on desktop

141
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,640
Speaker 3:  computer to run beeper So I can get my iMessages. Yeah. So if you just think

142
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,480
Speaker 3:  about the amount of prep work I have to do, So I can just roll

143
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,400
Speaker 3:  up onto the train.

144
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,120
Speaker 5:  Okay. No, but here's, here's the real thing.

145
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,040
Speaker 3:  Like I to set up two different extremely weird computing environments

146
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,600
Speaker 3:  and make them both work perfect. So I can execute this plan

147
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,840
Speaker 5:  If there, if The Verge believes in anything, it's in doing so much work.

148
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Speaker 5:  So you don't have to carry anything anywhere. Yeah. Like that is what we

149
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,680
Speaker 5:  stand for. I

150
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,760
Speaker 3:  Saw those notes and I was like, people get it? Yeah.

151
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

152
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,960
Speaker 3:  You just wanna roll up. It's the

153
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,560
Speaker 5:  Dream. But Neli the, the middle ground is you, you open it up and you

154
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,360
Speaker 5:  accomplish your other dream, which is to write on stories with a

155
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,320
Speaker 5:  red pen as an editor. So you get on the train, you

156
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,920
Speaker 5:  unfold your

157
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,760
Speaker 3:  Phone. If Google wants me to switch full-time to Android, just

158
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,520
Speaker 3:  make it in the, the Android Google Docs app.

159
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,760
Speaker 3:  You can circle things and that shows up as an edit everywhere in Google

160
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,520
Speaker 3:  Docs. Make that exclusive to the Android version of Google Docs. I'll switch

161
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,520
Speaker 3:  tomorrow. All I want to do is circle things with a red pen and send them

162
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,920
Speaker 3:  to David where it says clunky.

163
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,120
Speaker 3:  That's it. As an editor in chief, I've had but one goal and

164
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,640
Speaker 3:  I've saved laser focused on it this entire time. David's

165
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,760
Speaker 4:  Less excited about that goal.

166
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,920
Speaker 3:  Oh. At the very beginning of The Verge, Joanna Stern had a post-it note on

167
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,640
Speaker 3:  the side of her monitor that just said clunky. So she would, she, she'd be

168
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,400
Speaker 3:  like, I know what you're gonna say. So she would just remember it. I'm very

169
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,240
Speaker 3:  predictable man. All. right. The, that's all the preamble. I'm, I'm working

170
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,120
Speaker 3:  on my deck situation, David. That's

171
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,600
Speaker 5:  Okay. We're gonna check in next week. This is not, this is not a task. You

172
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,440
Speaker 5:  are allowed, if, if you have things on the train next week, we The

173
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,200
Speaker 5:  Vergecast public will be disappointed

174
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Speaker 3:  In you. I hate it. I carried my backpack on the train today. I was like,

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,520
Speaker 3:  why do I have all this stuff? This bag exists solely to have my laptop in

176
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,640
Speaker 3:  it, no bag. And I don't need all the stuff that's in it. But once you have

177
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,800
Speaker 3:  a bag, you start filling it with stuff.

178
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,280
Speaker 5:  Some people would say the answer is buy another laptop. I say, that's not

179
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,760
Speaker 5:  thinking hard

180
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,320
Speaker 3:  Enough. Yeah. A good answer is that I could actually ask our office people

181
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,320
Speaker 3:  for a desk. Yeah. And You know we're in return to work and nobody has desks.

182
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,120
Speaker 3:  It's all the stuff. I don't No, I'm not, I don't use software at

183
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,200
Speaker 3:  work. I'm not filling out it tickets and none of this is happening. You

184
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
Speaker 3:  know my dream. It's to never use enterprise software. Yeah. I'm gonna

185
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,960
Speaker 3:  get, I I would bet that I get closer to consistently having emails

186
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,720
Speaker 3:  printed out and handed to me than using D at work. I,

187
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,360
Speaker 3:  yeah. Like long term, what is more likely to be a real thing that

188
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,480
Speaker 3:  happens? It's, I get to the point where people hand me printed out

189
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,760
Speaker 3:  emails, then I consistently every day use Dexa

190
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,680
Speaker 4:  Work. I think if you don't, if you have a bag next week, then yeah, we're,

191
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,000
Speaker 4:  we're just gonna start only communicating with you with like printed emails.

192
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,960
Speaker 4:  Be like, can you check this in Slack? No. Email All, right?

193
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,800
Speaker 3:  We there's news. Yeah,

194
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,200
Speaker 4:  There is

195
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,080
Speaker 3:  News. There's a lot of news. But I'll, I'll, I'll work. I'm gonna go check

196
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,440
Speaker 3:  out the deck situation in the closet after this. Okay.

197
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,080
Speaker 3:  Lightning rounds. Let's start with gadget Lightning round. Yeah. David, you

198
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,840
Speaker 3:  got the first one. What's up?

199
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,840
Speaker 5:  I wanna talk about the Apple Pencil. The

200
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,080
Speaker 3:  Confusion Zone. The

201
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,920
Speaker 5:  Confusion Zone. We are entering the Confusion Zone, who knows how

202
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,120
Speaker 5:  long we'll be here, but we are here now. Thank

203
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,880
Speaker 4:  You Rod Sterling.

204
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,920
Speaker 5:  So Apple launched a new Pencil. It's a, it's a Pencil

205
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,960
Speaker 5:  but it charges with USB C. That is the

206
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,720
Speaker 5:  only thing about it that I understand. There is now an Apple Pencil that

207
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,600
Speaker 5:  charges with USB C. What Apple also did was

208
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,600
Speaker 5:  make the entire situation of buying an iPad and an Apple

209
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
Speaker 5:  Pencil vastly more confusing on top of already being more

210
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,080
Speaker 5:  confusing. And the funniest thing that has happened this week is that there

211
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,680
Speaker 5:  are, I would say a set of people on the internet who spend a lot of time

212
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,320
Speaker 5:  explaining weird decisions Apple makes as if they are not weird decisions.

213
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,720
Speaker 5:  And Apple lost everybody on this one. Yep. This was one of those, everybody

214
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,520
Speaker 5:  was like why on earth are there three pencils? There's now the Apple

215
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,440
Speaker 5:  Pencil first generation, which works for a subset of iPads. There's the Apple

216
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,640
Speaker 5:  Pencil second generation, which works for a subset of iPads and there's an

217
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,560
Speaker 5:  Apple Pencil USB C, which works for a different subset of iPads. And

218
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,200
Speaker 5:  there, there is just no world in which any of this makes any sense anymore.

219
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,560
Speaker 5:  And it has led a lot of people to reconsider whether the iPad makes any sense

220
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,120
Speaker 5:  anymore. Yeah. And I just, I just need you guys to feel as annoyed about

221
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,200
Speaker 3:  This. That's the ass dome, right? Where it's like they released the apple

222
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,800
Speaker 3:  Pencil u s pc. It's the first little domino and like the last one is someone

223
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,800
Speaker 3:  is like, I'm switching to Windows. Right?

224
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,040
Speaker 3:  I saw, I saw this happen this week. They're gonna go

225
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,320
Speaker 3:  full surface. Yeah. They're like, at least the surface pen makes sense. And

226
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,840
Speaker 3:  I can, I can just buy the one. And It works everywhere. Yeah. So the, I get

227
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,360
Speaker 3:  why they needed to make an Apple Pencil with USB C and I like the little

228
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,240
Speaker 3:  design. It's a slide ecap. So just opens maybe

229
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,120
Speaker 3:  the first affordance to charging an

230
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,480
Speaker 3:  accessory that makes sense that Apple has released

231
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,960
Speaker 3:  ever, at least in the context of Of compute. Compute. Like obviously AirPods

232
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,840
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Are fine. You don't have to plug it in. It's, it's not in the bottom

233
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,240
Speaker 3:  bottom. You don't have to take the cap off. It's not only magnetic to some

234
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,520
Speaker 3:  iPad,

235
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,080
Speaker 5:  You plug a thing into it instead of plugging it into a thing. Yeah. Which

236
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,120
Speaker 5:  is the obviously correct and better way to do everything. Yes.

237
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,480
Speaker 3:  It support people recognized and might have charging cables for all, all

238
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,440
Speaker 3:  very good. Yes. Great. So that part's cool. It's missing a bunch

239
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,880
Speaker 3:  of features. There's like a, there's a chart. Apple released a chart

240
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,760
Speaker 3:  with check marks of what all the things do. And it looks like one of those

241
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,880
Speaker 3:  charts of like when you go to buy health insurance or something and you're

242
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,400
Speaker 3:  like, I don't know what any of these words mean or whether I want this and

243
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,240
Speaker 3:  this is definitely gonna put me in debt. Like it's like that level of confusing

244
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,360
Speaker 3:  in the chart. Yeah. And there's a bunch of features that if you don't know

245
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,680
Speaker 3:  you need them, you, you're like, do I need hover?

246
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,400
Speaker 3:  Do I need double tap to switch? Yeah. Like it's,

247
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,200
Speaker 3:  it's hard to convey the value of the features in a chart like this.

248
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,300
Speaker 5:  Well and there's also the fact that the USB c Apple

249
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,260
Speaker 5:  Pencil, which is ostensibly the newest Apple Pencil, is missing a bunch of

250
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,500
Speaker 5:  features including features that exist on the first generation Apple Pencil

251
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,940
Speaker 5:  like pressure sensitivity, which I would argue is a very important feature

252
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,940
Speaker 5:  in like a high-end. Silas, this thing is $80. It does

253
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,700
Speaker 5:  not have pressure sensitivity. The very first Pencil Apple ever made

254
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,340
Speaker 5:  has pressure sensitivity. Like what are we doing here? Yeah.

255
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,940
Speaker 3:  Well it's not us. It's dapper. It's not circling things.

256
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,340
Speaker 3:  It's definitely not. Also the image they released to promote this

257
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,220
Speaker 3:  new Pencil. Just go look at it. We had a full slack conversation about it.

258
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,740
Speaker 3:  It is ridiculous. It is. It's a picture of a, like a

259
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,560
Speaker 3:  boba tea custard and it, I don't want to, it's like an

260
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,160
Speaker 3:  illustration of it. Parts of it look like a recipe.

261
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,520
Speaker 4:  Arrows go nowhere.

262
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,640
Speaker 3:  The recipe would not help you. Like if you just like look at an

263
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,560
Speaker 3:  illustration of a custard and there's just like some words on it that are

264
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,000
Speaker 3:  like bake until three 50. You're like, I don't know what I'm baking.

265
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,520
Speaker 3:  And then yes, there are arrows that go to nowhere. Yeah. And then it says

266
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,560
Speaker 3:  how many there might be as though this is like a catering order, but then

267
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,520
Speaker 3:  it's beautifully illustrated.

268
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,800
Speaker 4:  I like that the highlights were all the exact same width because there's

269
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,840
Speaker 4:  no pressure sensitivity.

270
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Speaker 3:  I didn't notice that. So it's can be the same width. I know. Just gonna look

271
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,480
Speaker 3:  at, I don't mean to whatever. It's, it's marketing material. It's an ad it,

272
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,560
Speaker 3:  we did that post a long time ago. It's like the only thing people can think

273
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,800
Speaker 3:  of to do with the service pen is circling things. And this is

274
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,600
Speaker 3:  like the ultimate exercise in nonsensical circling of things like

275
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,760
Speaker 3:  this image. No one would ever make it unless

276
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,280
Speaker 3:  they had been assigned to making an image to market a stylist.

277
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,840
Speaker 3:  That is the only reason it exists. And I think that's kind of indicative

278
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,800
Speaker 3:  of this whole exercise of the iPad. They sell a lot of

279
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,920
Speaker 3:  them, they have a lot of different kinds of uses.

280
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,880
Speaker 3:  It is 500 different kinds of appliance to people. But that

281
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,200
Speaker 3:  means it has no narrative. It's just a thing.

282
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,280
Speaker 3:  And it's like you can sell the ninth gen one with a lightning port.

283
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,720
Speaker 3:  You shouldn't, so kids can watch Disney plus I, but it's cheap. It's like

284
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,360
Speaker 3:  that thing needs to compete with fire tablets that are essentially

285
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,280
Speaker 3:  free or you can sell one at the top end that has all

286
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,760
Speaker 3:  the features in the world and is meant to compete with Windows laptops.

287
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. There were a bunch of rumors before this announcement that we were

288
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,480
Speaker 5:  gonna get a big iPad refresh this week. That there was gonna be some

289
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,240
Speaker 5:  much bigger news about tablets. And I think

290
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,920
Speaker 5:  a, the fact that that didn't happen is sort of telling, I mean the iPad is

291
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,000
Speaker 5:  way overdue. That whole lineup is overdue for like a real

292
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,440
Speaker 5:  serious refresh. It's been, I mean the, the ninth generation one

293
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,160
Speaker 5:  has a home button and a lightning port, like it's way behind and you can

294
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,120
Speaker 5:  still buy it. And it's still, I think $329 is the starting price

295
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,920
Speaker 5:  for an iPad is really important to Apple. And I think the new low end

296
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,880
Speaker 5:  iPad is, is like 450 bucks. And I'm just, I'm betting Apple

297
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,840
Speaker 5:  just cannot figure out how to sell that thing at its margins for

298
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,560
Speaker 5:  $329. But we're getting to the point now where it just

299
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,040
Speaker 5:  doesn't make any sense that lineup anymore. It's like if you're an

300
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,720
Speaker 5:  iPad mini person, it's easy. You just buy an iPad mini, that thing kicks

301
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,640
Speaker 5:  ass. I'm an iPad mini person. Buy an iPad mini same. Beyond that,

302
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,520
Speaker 5:  there's an entry level iPad and another entry level iPad. There's an iPad

303
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,480
Speaker 5:  Air. There are the iPad pros. Like we, they've just lost

304
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,120
Speaker 5:  the plot here. And I think you're right. It's because Apple is increasingly

305
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,960
Speaker 5:  unclear what this thing is for like, I think that the MacBook was gonna

306
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,480
Speaker 5:  die and the iPad was gonna be the computer of the future. And then actually

307
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,200
Speaker 5:  the MacBook got awesome and has had a real resurgence.

308
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,120
Speaker 5:  And now the question is like, we're back to, is there a space between your

309
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,800
Speaker 5:  increasingly large, increasingly powerful phone and you're increasingly

310
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,880
Speaker 5:  long lasting, increasingly portable laptop and

311
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,320
Speaker 5:  You know what, 13 years ago when the iPad came out, there actually was a

312
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,560
Speaker 5:  lot of gap that your phone didn't cover in your laptop, didn't cover. And

313
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,160
Speaker 5:  those two things have both come closer together. And I feels like the space

314
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,720
Speaker 5:  for the iPad is shrinking and shrinking and shrinking.

315
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,560
Speaker 3:  Yes. I would remind you that we open the show with a

316
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,560
Speaker 3:  ludicrous but entirely realistic conversation

317
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,120
Speaker 3:  about whether I can just walk onto a train with a folding phone that turns

318
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,000
Speaker 3:  into a desktop PC at this office. Yeah. And

319
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,040
Speaker 3:  again, ludicrous but not a thing I

320
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,920
Speaker 3:  can't do. Like I, it's just a thing I can do right now.

321
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,480
Speaker 3:  Yeah. As I, I can buy a phone that opens into a tablet,

322
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,360
Speaker 3:  arrive at work and turn it into a reasonable

323
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,920
Speaker 3:  facsimile of a desktop computer. Yeah. Because it will be running decks

324
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,560
Speaker 3:  which r it will have to, let me put on something.

325
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,280
Speaker 3:  The iPad does not like it. It's not cognizant

326
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,040
Speaker 3:  of that reality. Right. In the application ecosystem, in the user

327
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,400
Speaker 3:  interface with stage manager, like all that stuff, it still thinks

328
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,640
Speaker 3:  that people don't want laptops. I think that's just getting increasingly

329
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
Speaker 3:  untenable for No,

330
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,600
Speaker 4:  I think they know it, it about the laptops because half of those

331
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,600
Speaker 4:  iPads become laptops. You know you have to spend like 150,

332
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,240
Speaker 4:  $200 for the case. But you can turn most of those iPads into

333
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,520
Speaker 3:  The magic keyboard is $300. I was gonna

334
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,840
Speaker 5:  Say I wish it was 150.

335
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,320
Speaker 4:  Look, it's been like four years since I bought one. But that's brutal.

336
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,840
Speaker 4:  But, but like they're very aware and they, they, they try to go after that

337
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,640
Speaker 4:  kind of surface pricing. They try to tr position it as a surface, but then

338
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,880
Speaker 4:  they have the cheap ones and the, and the mini. And they're like, well no,

339
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,680
Speaker 4:  no, these are iPad iPads and these are iPad laptops.

340
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,440
Speaker 4:  But what's

341
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,160
Speaker 3:  Really interesting, what has changed my mind about the iPad is watching two

342
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,040
Speaker 3:  people in my family use them. Okay. Max, who is five, who

343
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,240
Speaker 3:  watches YouTube kids and plays Minecraft and

344
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,600
Speaker 3:  there's actually a really tight nexus there. She watches people play

345
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,320
Speaker 3:  Minecraft on YouTube kids and then she plays Minecraft and that means

346
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,160
Speaker 3:  she's now great at Minecraft because she's five. She doesn't have to

347
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,480
Speaker 3:  make any money. She's

348
00:19:59,480 --> 00:19:59,880
Speaker 4:  Terrified.

349
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,480
Speaker 3:  We feed her, we take her everywhere. We can just pick her up and move her

350
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,720
Speaker 3:  if she's not in the right place. You know. Like she can, all of her mental

351
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,320
Speaker 3:  energy is focused on Minecraft. Yeah. A way that is wonderful and

352
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,920
Speaker 3:  I miss it. But like the thing is perfectly adequate

353
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,520
Speaker 3:  for that task. She is not like, I want a newer better

354
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,440
Speaker 3:  iPad. It doesn't even matter to her. Right. The thing is a window to, to

355
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,480
Speaker 3:  Minecraft. I don't even know how she does it. 'cause she's using touchscreen

356
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,880
Speaker 3:  controls to move around in Minecraft. It makes me dizzy watching her play

357
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,120
Speaker 3:  this game. Yeah. I'm like, do you want a control her? She's like, get outta

358
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,040
Speaker 3:  here old man. It's weird. She's five. She's mean. No,

359
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,320
Speaker 3:  she's not.

360
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,080
Speaker 5:  And it by the way, in a, in a certain way that is like perfect.

361
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,560
Speaker 5:  The dream state of the iPad. Like what an unbelievable success story of

362
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,520
Speaker 5:  a device you just

363
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,960
Speaker 3:  Described. Yeah. Right. It's an appliance for Minecraft. Yeah. Yeah. Is doing

364
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,920
Speaker 3:  that job perfectly and it charges using the same cable as her mother's iPhone,

365
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,880
Speaker 3:  which makes life very convenient for those two. Right.

366
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,160
Speaker 3:  Very inconvenient for me at this juncture. It used to charge the same cable

367
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,880
Speaker 3:  as my phone. Now I'm just like a weird old guy in the corner

368
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,760
Speaker 3:  being like, it's a USB C cable. Like I'm just like left out

369
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,720
Speaker 3:  of my family. That's her right appliance for

370
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,400
Speaker 3:  consuming video on like handful of video apps and playing one, one game.

371
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,440
Speaker 3:  Then there's my sister who is a full like

372
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,800
Speaker 3:  iPad as a laptop person.

373
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,520
Speaker 4:  Love this.

374
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,400
Speaker 3:  So my sister's a doctor. She goes to work Windows is

375
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,240
Speaker 3:  foisted upon her. She comes back and she has no desire to

376
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,040
Speaker 3:  further use traditional desktop operating systems.

377
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,520
Speaker 3:  She just is on her iPad and she's ultra effective.

378
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,800
Speaker 3:  She's like an iPad person. And I watch her use this thing and it's like literally

379
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,040
Speaker 3:  just a relief from desktop operating metaphors. Hmm.

380
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,080
Speaker 4:  Yes. I mean I do that. Yeah. I, I've got one where like if I,

381
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,440
Speaker 4:  if I have to do work on the weekends or something, sometimes I'll go and

382
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,440
Speaker 4:  use my, my computer. But a lot of times I'll be like, I'm gonna pull up my

383
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,320
Speaker 4:  2018 iPad Pro and use that just to escape. Yeah.

384
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,640
Speaker 4:  Just to not feel like I'm at work. 'cause Slack will probably still be open.

385
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,040
Speaker 4:  'cause I probably left it open and like some drafts that I owe edits on or

386
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,720
Speaker 4:  there and I'm like, I don't wanna look at that. I just wanna go and do things.

387
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,160
Speaker 4:  And so it's really nice. And then I got my, my other iPad, which is just

388
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,000
Speaker 4:  for in bed reading and, and looking at YouTube

389
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,160
Speaker 4:  and not going to sleep.

390
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:13,840
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

391
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:14,760
Speaker 4:  It's great.

392
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,320
Speaker 3:  You're hitting a point that I've, I'm starting to hit now, which is like,

393
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,800
Speaker 3:  I should have computers per room.

394
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I, that's, that's basically what's happened.

395
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,160
Speaker 3:  Like, I used to like have a laptop that I would carry around. I'm like, what

396
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,360
Speaker 3:  if I get a Chromebook for the living room? And it's like, it's right over

397
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,920
Speaker 3:  there. Yeah.

398
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,000
Speaker 4:  I I don't have anybody to be like, no.

399
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,400
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So I try to do this with my iPad. I was like, the iPad will just

400
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,040
Speaker 3:  like live in the living room. It's hard be my TV computer and an iPad on

401
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,120
Speaker 3:  a magic keyboard is like not a good laptop. So if anything at work happens,

402
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,880
Speaker 3:  it's like I can't do it and I have to go get my laptop. And then the magic

403
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,640
Speaker 3:  keyboard is like not great for lap. Yeah. Like if you're on a couch with

404
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,600
Speaker 3:  it, it's like, oh, this is somewhat uncomfortable. I put

405
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,960
Speaker 4:  It a pillow. Yeah. And then I put it on top. That's, that's my little habit

406
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,240
Speaker 4:  when

407
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,680
Speaker 3:  I say this is the domino, by the way, apple released the USB c

408
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,520
Speaker 3:  Apple Pencil and here we are. I'm like, I gotta get a Chromebook for my living

409
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,400
Speaker 3:  room. Yeah. I'm telling you people are like evaluating all the places

410
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,200
Speaker 3:  they would otherwise put an iPad and be like, oh, there's a slightly better

411
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,720
Speaker 3:  product to put in that place unless you're using it as an

412
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,560
Speaker 3:  appliance. Unless it has a single purpose. And you've, you've

413
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,560
Speaker 3:  jammed an iPad into that purpose. Like playing my, again, playing Minecraft,

414
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,480
Speaker 3:  watching videos for the longest time. We, my oldest iPad

415
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,960
Speaker 3:  lived on our old treadmill and Becky just used it

416
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,480
Speaker 3:  to do Peloton treadmill workouts. Like it was just a Peloton tv.

417
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,240
Speaker 3:  And then we moved and she's like, I'm buying a real Peloton. And we threw

418
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,200
Speaker 3:  that iPad away. Yeah. But like that's all, it's the thing is an

419
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,400
Speaker 3:  appliance. And I think Apple has not, it has not marketed the thing well

420
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,720
Speaker 3:  as like, it is an appliance. It's like, here's all the iPads you can buy

421
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,640
Speaker 3:  and it, assuming the market will just figure it out. But then you get

422
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,040
Speaker 3:  to the Pencil and you're like, I don't even know what to buy. Right.

423
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,560
Speaker 5:  I mean, I think the, the thing that Apple has held onto all this time is

424
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,480
Speaker 5:  that it is possible to be all things to all people because

425
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,360
Speaker 5:  it's just a screen. Because it has the accessories, because it

426
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,200
Speaker 5:  has a gigantic app ecosystem. It can solve everybody's

427
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,920
Speaker 5:  problems because everybody has different problems, but everybody has problems.

428
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,800
Speaker 5:  Right. And the iPad can be the solution to all those problems. And if you

429
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,920
Speaker 5:  have a subset of problems, I think that's true. Like if you want to play

430
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,120
Speaker 5:  a certain kind of game, the iPad is the best thing that exists on earth to

431
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,680
Speaker 5:  play that kind of game. Alex and I talk about reading on the show all the

432
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,880
Speaker 5:  time, and it's like the iPad is the best reading device. Like it's not close.

433
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,840
Speaker 5:  Yep. It just is. It's the best Minecraft device. If you

434
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,000
Speaker 5:  wanna watch videos about Minecraft and then play Minecraft. Right. Like if

435
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,840
Speaker 5:  you have this one need, it's a really expensive device, but It works.

436
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,560
Speaker 5:  The problem is Apple has made it so vastly complicated to figure out which

437
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,360
Speaker 5:  one is the right one for your needs that you're gonna start to like literally

438
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,000
Speaker 5:  push people away. Because it, I just, I, I'm, I'm looking at these pencils

439
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,160
Speaker 5:  and the answer for me is I'm not gonna buy one because like yeah. What is

440
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,680
Speaker 5:  happening? I'm gonna go buy the $10 knockoff on Amazon that just works with

441
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,200
Speaker 5:  all of them. It's gonna be fine. Like Apple

442
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,600
Speaker 4:  Used to be really, really good at this too. Right? Like Apple would go and

443
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,280
Speaker 4:  and kill something just to keep their lineup as clean as possible.

444
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,400
Speaker 4:  And over the years it's gotten messier and messier and, and

445
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,160
Speaker 4:  that's fine in a lot of ways. It's, it's good. Like there's a lot of phones

446
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,120
Speaker 4:  you can choose from. They're very affordable. Yeah. All of that. But with

447
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,520
Speaker 4:  the iPads in particular, it's like, no, you've got made it too messy. It's

448
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,600
Speaker 4:  just too messy. Like,

449
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,880
Speaker 3:  Because they don't know for most, well, Apple's so big now they sell so new

450
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,520
Speaker 3:  products. Yeah. They need something at every price point. Right. And so they

451
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,960
Speaker 3:  just bring things down to price. So that makes a little bit of sense to me

452
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,720
Speaker 3:  a little. But the old one's still here if you want it. They particularly

453
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,520
Speaker 3:  do that with the iPhones, with the iPad. I think they don't,

454
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,560
Speaker 3:  they have to articulate a reason that you're not gonna buy the cheapest thing,

455
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,840
Speaker 3:  which I think in this case is a fire tablet.

456
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,280
Speaker 5:  Well, and and not only that, I mean I, I think we could sit here and I

457
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,080
Speaker 5:  could pretty quickly explain to you the difference between the four models

458
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,720
Speaker 5:  of the iPhone, right? Like there are, there are features that you get on

459
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,320
Speaker 5:  one that you don't get on the other other than screen bigger

460
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,600
Speaker 5:  thing more expensive. Can you tell me the difference between the entry level

461
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,920
Speaker 5:  iPad and the 12.9 inch iPad Pro?

462
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,600
Speaker 3:  It has a LIDAR sensor. David,

463
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,120
Speaker 3:  I don't know what you're talking about. Everyone is constantly out here doing

464
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:09,040
Speaker 3:  LIDAR stuff. It's, it's a future. I will say that in our, my

465
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,240
Speaker 3:  new office in the new house, Liam, Liam, our producer

466
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,400
Speaker 3:  legitimately has like carpet samples for me to like deco

467
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,120
Speaker 3:  this room and treat this room that I have to go look at. And he was like,

468
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Speaker 3:  send me some dimensions. And I did the lidar room scanning thing with the

469
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,960
Speaker 3:  iPhone and it was super cool. And then I ended up with like a file

470
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,440
Speaker 3:  that I had no idea how to use it or send it to anyone.

471
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,080
Speaker 4:  You're like, it's here.

472
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,480
Speaker 3:  This lightning round has gone on way too long. I'm telling it's a Confusion.

473
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,560
Speaker 3:  Zone. Yeah. That's all I'm saying. But

474
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Speaker 5:  It also, my prediction is at some point in the next 12 months, either this

475
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,520
Speaker 5:  is gonna get much worse or Apple is just going to clean it up drastically.

476
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,080
Speaker 5:  And I would bet on that. I think we're gonna get a bunch of new iPads that

477
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,760
Speaker 5:  make a lot more sense very soon. I

478
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,240
Speaker 4:  Hope the latter.

479
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,680
Speaker 3:  I am gonna bet on more confusing. Just to be contrary.

480
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,840
Speaker 3:  I have no insight. One

481
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,280
Speaker 5:  Of the iPads is gonna be a soundbar.

482
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

483
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,640
Speaker 3:  We got a lot of emails of people who are like, don't know what you're talking

484
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,760
Speaker 3:  about. They're definitely making a soundbar. Thank you. No way. I'm gonna

485
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,360
Speaker 3:  get printed out emails delivered to me at work before Apple releases a soundbar

486
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,960
Speaker 4:  And they're all gonna be the soundbar.

487
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,480
Speaker 3:  T M I card and you're not leaving the office before. I have a folding

488
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Speaker 3:  phone and you have an H T M I card. You've seen the thing like, it's like

489
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,840
Speaker 3:  a center cam it, I think that's what it's called. Yeah. And it's just like

490
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,640
Speaker 3:  a little itty bitty camera sensor on a stick. And the idea is that it, it

491
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,560
Speaker 3:  is not in the way and it's just a bad camera. Like this, this

492
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,360
Speaker 3:  is my problem with, it's like I want it to look good because I'm a

493
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,440
Speaker 3:  freshest camera. Right. Do

494
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,200
Speaker 5:  You wanna look nice? Yeah.

495
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,600
Speaker 3:  So this is like, what gets me at this is like, oh, you can put a good camera

496
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,040
Speaker 3:  back there. Yeah. Yeah. And that, that I think changes my

497
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,000
Speaker 3:  relationship with, I dunno, I'm definitely getting one. The other thing that

498
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,840
Speaker 3:  I think is super important about this is we, we just

499
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,800
Speaker 3:  keep seeing this over and over again. All these companies,

500
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,720
Speaker 3:  the little companies are making gadgets for creators. Like there's a

501
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,160
Speaker 3:  real market there. Those people have needs, the needs are not

502
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,520
Speaker 3:  perfectly met by pro hardware or pro cameras.

503
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,760
Speaker 3:  There's a a sweet spot there for Twitch streamers and YouTubers and all that.

504
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,080
Speaker 3:  And I think it is fascinating. I thought we would

505
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,920
Speaker 3:  see a bunch of that stuff or work from home in the pandemic. And we're, we,

506
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,000
Speaker 3:  we've definitely seen some of it, some like cooler little docs that market

507
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:09,000
Speaker 3:  petered out because people were not like, you buy it

508
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,680
Speaker 3:  once and it goes away and there's, it's not growing. Hey, I want to grow

509
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,440
Speaker 3:  up to be a streamer, or Hey, I run a small company and making

510
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,200
Speaker 3:  content is the best market I can do and these things and I need some help

511
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,080
Speaker 3:  doing it. Well that is a large and growing market and I

512
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,920
Speaker 3:  just, the amount of gadgets that are coming out to solve that problem is

513
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,200
Speaker 3:  actually pretty fascinating. Yeah. And I like I You know I'm a gadget nerd.

514
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,960
Speaker 3:  So, I'm excited about it. But I, I think there's something durable there

515
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,760
Speaker 3:  about the creator platforms that we haven't quite seen yet.

516
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,920
Speaker 3:  Like YouTuber's been around for a long time. The stuff to make YouTube videos.

517
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,760
Speaker 3:  Well there's not actually a lot of it. Like

518
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,840
Speaker 3:  you still kinda get funneled into buying a Sony camera and Premiere if you

519
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,240
Speaker 3:  wanna make a

520
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,880
Speaker 4:  YouTube video. Yeah. It's like podcasting where the first time you do it,

521
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,200
Speaker 4:  you have to go and you Google and there's like three websites. They look

522
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,600
Speaker 4:  like absolute garbage and they give you the actual Yeah. List of stuff you

523
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,520
Speaker 4:  wanna buy. And it's all like pro stuff if you want it to be good.

524
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,400
Speaker 3:  Even that market, there's like a new shore mic that's a Qs C. Yeah. And

525
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,280
Speaker 4:  Th and then, and we've started to see in the last couple of years, we started

526
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,120
Speaker 4:  to see like, oh, used to, I'd have to go buy a whole rig in order

527
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,080
Speaker 4:  for my, my podcasting setup to sound nice. And now it's like pretty

528
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,360
Speaker 4:  inexpensive for most people to just sound nice Yeah. Outta the box. And,

529
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,160
Speaker 4:  and I think we're getting rapidly to that place with cameras and, and that

530
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,920
Speaker 4:  whole setup and soon in the lights and everything else. Like, everybody's

531
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,360
Speaker 4:  gonna look the same.

532
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,720
Speaker 3:  I can't wait to put up the camera lights in the office. Liam. They're coming.

533
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,800
Speaker 3:  They're coming. This lightning round just keeps going on. Alex, what's yours?

534
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah. All. right. So mine is Analogue who makes really, really good

535
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,440
Speaker 4:  emulation emulator slash consoles is doing an N 64.

536
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,480
Speaker 4:  And I'm personally am very, very excited 'cause the N 64 is the

537
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,840
Speaker 4:  hardest, maybe not the hardest, but probably one of the hardest

538
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,000
Speaker 4:  consoles to emulate. It's super hard to emulate in software

539
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,720
Speaker 4:  because the, the processor was all custom. And so

540
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,560
Speaker 4:  you have to have a really, really powerful computer to play a lot of N 64

541
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,080
Speaker 4:  games. If you're emulating them this, you'll be able to play carts. It's

542
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,920
Speaker 4:  got an F P G A that like mimics the original hardware. So it should be

543
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,680
Speaker 4:  a lot faster. It should play carts natively. And then if you do somehow get

544
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,840
Speaker 4:  software on it, it would play the software natively. The the emulated games

545
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,800
Speaker 4:  natively. And I'm just like super, super excited for this thing. Yeah. Like

546
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,760
Speaker 4:  a little too excited. I'm gonna have one. The

547
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,440
Speaker 3:  Lack of emulation for N 64 has made it like almost a forgotten console. Yeah.

548
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,240
Speaker 4:  Because everybody's like, okay, what was on it? Goldeneye,

549
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,520
Speaker 4:  which like important

550
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,280
Speaker 3:  Greatest game of all time. Yeah. Like Mario 64 perhaps the most important

551
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,240
Speaker 3:  game of all time. Yeah.

552
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,280
Speaker 4:  I mean Mario 64 there was ob obviously the two legends that

553
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,120
Speaker 4:  Zel does and those are about it when people talk about it. But if you grew

554
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,720
Speaker 4:  up in that age, it was like, nah. Played a lot of games. Like Chris Welch

555
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,080
Speaker 4:  is always like W C W. There

556
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,920
Speaker 5:  Was also the first Mario Tennis, which was the video game

557
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,880
Speaker 5:  in my life I have been best at. It wasn't

558
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,400
Speaker 4:  The first Mario Tennis that was for the virtual boy.

559
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,240
Speaker 3:  Wow. David. How dare you forget the virtual

560
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,080
Speaker 4:  Boy. How dare you.

561
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,440
Speaker 3:  How dare

562
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,680
Speaker 5:  You. Yeah, it was the first one.

563
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:06,240
Speaker 3:  Let's

564
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,480
Speaker 5:  Not, not

565
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,680
Speaker 4:  The first one. People play it. Do you mean technically

566
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,640
Speaker 5:  The first one was like the one someone made in their lab in Japan,

567
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,400
Speaker 5:  but I don't consider that one reel

568
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:15,640
Speaker 3:  Either.

569
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,760
Speaker 5:  The first one was for the N 64

570
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,400
Speaker 3:  All. right. I'm excited about this. There's no pictures of it yet. There's

571
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,440
Speaker 3:  like shadowy Yeah. Rendering things.

572
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,520
Speaker 4:  It's gonna come later. I I I know we'll probably be talking to that

573
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,360
Speaker 4:  team and, and, and hearing more from Analogue soon. So I'm really, really

574
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,280
Speaker 4:  excited and it just looks cool and also closer to a Game

575
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,760
Speaker 4:  Cube from Analogue. And that's what I really want. 'cause they are so

576
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,880
Speaker 4:  expensive on eBay and I really regret selling mine.

577
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,720
Speaker 3:  Can I tell you my story of game group regret?

578
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,200
Speaker 4:  Yes.

579
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,000
Speaker 3:  This is, this is

580
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,000
Speaker 4:  So the the face alone says it's gonna be a great story. All right.

581
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,760
Speaker 3:  I'll tell you after the break. Liam says, I have to tell you with the break.

582
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,040
Speaker 3:  We'll be right back. Everybody with the story of Game Cube Regret

583
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,200
Speaker 3:  All, right? We're back. What is it? Here's a story from my youth about the

584
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,120
Speaker 3:  Game Cube. Okay. So there is a bar by my apartment in college called the

585
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,960
Speaker 3:  Cove All. right. And on Thursday nights the Cove would've $4 pitchers.

586
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,880
Speaker 3:  So we all went to the cove quite a bit. This is a

587
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,800
Speaker 5:  Story from like the 1930s. Yeah. Like what are we

588
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,600
Speaker 3:  What This is like a real thing in Hyde Park in Chicago, the Cove

589
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,320
Speaker 3:  had $4 pitchers on Thursday. So we're just there. We were there a lot.

590
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:18,360
Speaker 3:  This is Milwaukee's best though, right? Like no was Miller Light? It was

591
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,760
Speaker 3:  like any any garbage domestic pier. Okay. But you can tell that I grew up

592
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,360
Speaker 3:  again in the fifties and this is the time that the, the Game Cube

593
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,600
Speaker 3:  was the state of the art console. Yeah.

594
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,760
Speaker 5:  The war had just ended

595
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:33,440
Speaker 3:  Everybody. And yeah. So we're there a lot. We know all the You know the,

596
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,280
Speaker 3:  the people who come through and one day Heineken

597
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,320
Speaker 3:  is at the Cove and they're having a Madden tournament

598
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,040
Speaker 3:  and I'm like, I'm in the Madden tournament. I don't know if you've ever tried

599
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,880
Speaker 3:  to play Madden on the Game Cube controller. It, it makes

600
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,880
Speaker 3:  no sense. Like everyone was horrible at Madden on the game

601
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,480
Speaker 3:  Cube. Like I want you to go pull over in your car and look at a picture of

602
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,440
Speaker 3:  a game cube controller and imagine trying to play Madden on this thing.

603
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,360
Speaker 3:  Best controller ever made for playing three games Soul

604
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,080
Speaker 3:  caliber like in classic Nintendo style. They're like, we made

605
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,640
Speaker 3:  this controller to play one specific Mario game. Yeah.

606
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,280
Speaker 3:  It's a game where Luigi fights ghosts with water

607
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,400
Speaker 5:  And there's only one, there's essentially one button on the game cue controller

608
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,280
Speaker 5:  and all the rest of them are tiny and thousands of miles away from each other.

609
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,160
Speaker 3:  I love it. And Madden is about quickly deciding what button press

610
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,440
Speaker 3:  and everyone's like, I don't know, yellow and like it's a disaster. So this

611
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,080
Speaker 3:  is the longest Madden tournament of all time fueled

612
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:37,280
Speaker 3:  by $4 pitchers of beer. Oh. So on top of it, everyone

613
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,720
Speaker 3:  is destroyed. The long story is I won the Madden tournament

614
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:45,120
Speaker 3:  and I came home with a game cube with the Heineken logo. Silk

615
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,840
Speaker 3:  screened all over the top, which my friends and I all called the Heine cube.

616
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,880
Speaker 3:  And if I only had held onto this thing, max would be going to

617
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,720
Speaker 3:  college tomorrow. Yeah. I'd be like, take her now. Harvard. Yeah. Heine

618
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,240
Speaker 3:  cube baby. That's my story. I

619
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,560
Speaker 5:  Thought that was a sad story. That's an awesome story. Well,

620
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,800
Speaker 3:  I don't have it anymore. Oh, okay. It's the loss of money. I think I gave

621
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,880
Speaker 3:  it to my friend Robert when he, when he graduated. Robert, if you're listening,

622
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,840
Speaker 3:  I'll send you a t-shirt in exchange for the heine cube

623
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:16,320
Speaker 5:  Neli. I have really good news for you. Huh? I you can buy right now

624
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,800
Speaker 5:  six Nintendo Heineken game cubes for the low low price of

625
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,720
Speaker 5:  $20,000.

626
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,760
Speaker 3:  No. Are you kidding me?

627
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,760
Speaker 5:  No, that's real. I just found this uneven

628
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,080
Speaker 3:  But like, like a lot of six Hena cubes. Six

629
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:36,080
Speaker 5:  Hena cubes, three purple, three black. There were only a hundred of them

630
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,760
Speaker 5:  made according to the eBay listing. Jesus fucking Christ. $20,000.

631
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,400
Speaker 3:  I had one

632
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,320
Speaker 4:  That could have been you.

633
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,400
Speaker 5:  33 people have this on their watch list. I'm just saying

634
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,760
Speaker 3:  I had one of these things for three years.

635
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,640
Speaker 4:  Not anymore.

636
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,240
Speaker 3:  I'm so annoyed with myself. Oh, the verse cast is over everybody.

637
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,240
Speaker 4:  We're done

638
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,560
Speaker 3:  For the game. I've gotta go back in time to play Madden on GameCube

639
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,640
Speaker 3:  so my daughter can go to college. I have to invent a time machine

640
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,720
Speaker 3:  and tell my, tell my drunk 22 year old self You

641
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,360
Speaker 3:  hold onto that game cube,

642
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,760
Speaker 4:  Don't you give it away.

643
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,040
Speaker 3:  I'm much worse. I've been playing the new Madden. I have no idea how this

644
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,000
Speaker 3:  game works anymore. When I describe Madden as knowing what button to push

645
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,800
Speaker 3:  quickly, that is no longer true. Yeah, it's

646
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,400
Speaker 4:  Like team management now, right?

647
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,040
Speaker 3:  No, that's a whole other part of it. There's like a whole Pokemon version

648
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,480
Speaker 3:  of manic Madden that you can play. But

649
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,800
Speaker 5:  Now you have to know, you have to know where to look and you have to like

650
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,240
Speaker 5:  aim. It's, it's, it's, you have to know like six buttons to press at the

651
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:32,480
Speaker 5:  same time.

652
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,600
Speaker 3:  The game is so hard that they've added bullet time to it.

653
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,840
Speaker 4:  Nope. Nope. Your football's gotten too hard.

654
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:42,960
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's like this isn't how this works for anyone. All. right. Let's

655
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,440
Speaker 3:  carry on with our all lightning round show. Although this is kind of like

656
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,720
Speaker 3:  the Tesla round, 'cause Tesla had earnings. There's a lot of news

657
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,560
Speaker 3:  buried in Tesla earnings. I'll quickly start by saying as long as you're

658
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,320
Speaker 3:  talking about Elon X, the artist formerly known as Twitter

659
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,160
Speaker 3:  rolled out a plan where in two countries they're gonna start charging people

660
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,680
Speaker 3:  a dollar to sign up on the web to keep away the bots.

661
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,120
Speaker 3:  I dunno about you. If I for example, had access to a bot farm, I would

662
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,920
Speaker 3:  quickly realize that I could just bankrupt you on Musk with credit card fees.

663
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,400
Speaker 3:  I dunno this plan's gonna work. I don't have access to a bot farm. I wish.

664
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,320
Speaker 3:  No ill will to anyone. I'm just saying it's a thing. It seems like you open

665
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,240
Speaker 3:  the door to a particular kind of problem with this plan. We'll, we'll set

666
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,080
Speaker 3:  that aside. Yeah. Tesla earnings though are kind of like

667
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,960
Speaker 3:  all over the place. Do you wanna start with the Cybertruck or do you wanna

668
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,840
Speaker 3:  start with the money? Let's

669
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,600
Speaker 5:  Start with the Cybertruck

670
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,920
Speaker 3:  All, right. Here's the quote Elon Musk says we dug our own grave with the

671
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,520
Speaker 3:  Cybertruck

672
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,000
Speaker 3:  'cause it's so complicated and so hard to make

673
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,440
Speaker 4:  And ugly.

674
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,320
Speaker 3:  There's that aspect of it. I would say just

675
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:47,640
Speaker 3:  throwing

676
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,680
Speaker 4:  It out there, just a little feeling I have.

677
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,320
Speaker 3:  They're going to deliver the first few on

678
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,320
Speaker 3:  November 30th at the factory in Texas. The Gigafactory in Texas. They have

679
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,960
Speaker 3:  not said how much these will cost I or to whom they will be

680
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,360
Speaker 3:  delivered

681
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,320
Speaker 4:  Concerning.

682
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,440
Speaker 3:  You get the feeling these first, these are like show deliveries. Yeah. Like

683
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,240
Speaker 3:  Kimball Musk will take delivery of a Cybertruck. Yeah,

684
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,440
Speaker 3:  it's, it's like one of those things, it's like who is buying them for what

685
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,880
Speaker 3:  price? There's no price release. The only people buying them are obviously

686
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,880
Speaker 3:  a pre-existing relationship with Tesla and they will take delivery upon

687
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,640
Speaker 3:  delivery. The price will be revealed again, not how most people buy a car.

688
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,200
Speaker 3:  Just putting that out there.

689
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,280
Speaker 5:  Although I will say if any company can make that a thing,

690
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,760
Speaker 5:  it's Tesla like.

691
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think that's

692
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,360
Speaker 5:  The specific hold this company has over a subset of people where

693
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,480
Speaker 5:  they can just like, oh and

694
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,560
Speaker 3:  And like Ferrari,

695
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,360
Speaker 4:  I guess Ferrari does kind of do that now. Yeah. The

696
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:49,240
Speaker 3:  Ultra high-end hypercar manufacturers. It's like

697
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,720
Speaker 4:  Invitation only. Yes. And then you find out afterwards. Yeah, but look at

698
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,400
Speaker 4:  a Ferrari and look at a Cybertruck. Which one of those do you wanna have

699
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,320
Speaker 4:  enough money and spend it on it? Like if you're that rich,

700
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,800
Speaker 3:  I can't wait for that moment to be a TikTok with a picture of a Ferrari

701
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,880
Speaker 3:  in a picture of a Cybertruck

702
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:06,720
Speaker 5:  Also because

703
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,360
Speaker 4:  Which one do you want?

704
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,960
Speaker 5:  The, the Cybertruck that we've seen and we've now seen a lot of pictures

705
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,720
Speaker 5:  of these things in the wild. They look like crap. Like Yeah. Like yeah. I

706
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,520
Speaker 5:  think reasonable people can disagree on whether the Cybertruck is a cool

707
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,760
Speaker 5:  looking vehicle or not. It's personally not my thing, but I know it is lots

708
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,280
Speaker 5:  of people's thing. Fine. The ones they're making look like

709
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:28,480
Speaker 5:  shit. Like they, they are poorly made. Elon Musk has

710
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,480
Speaker 5:  talked a lot about the, like the machine tolerances and how close everything

711
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,840
Speaker 5:  has to be. They're, they're out there with like essentially like duct tape

712
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,640
Speaker 5:  holding the pieces together. Like they're not making this thing well right

713
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,680
Speaker 5:  now. And I think it's very funny that the people who are gonna get the first

714
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:45,680
Speaker 5:  ones are like the diehards. Either the Tesla diehards or the

715
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,400
Speaker 5:  Elon Musk diehards or the Cybertruck diehards. And they're essentially gonna

716
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,840
Speaker 5:  get cars that look like I built them and like that's not good. Yeah.

717
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,040
Speaker 3:  So lemme read you this quote. The rest of the, we dug our own grave quote

718
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,480
Speaker 3:  and I want to see if people can make the connection to the other person who

719
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:04,320
Speaker 3:  spoke like this. We dug our own grave with the Cybertruck

720
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,880
Speaker 3:  at Musk. The Cybertruck is one of those special products that only comes

721
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,760
Speaker 3:  along once in a long while and special products that come along

722
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,600
Speaker 3:  once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to

723
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,120
Speaker 3:  reach volume and to be prosperous. So the first part of that

724
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,720
Speaker 3:  is Steve Jobs. Yep.

725
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,640
Speaker 3:  I'm very excited to be standing here to do today. Every now and again, you're

726
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:29,040
Speaker 3:  lucky to make one special product like the Mac or the iPod or the

727
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:29,640
Speaker 3:  iPhone,

728
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:35,040
Speaker 3:  that that's how we in, that's how we began The iPhone event is almost this

729
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,400
Speaker 3:  line. Exactly what he did not say at the end of the iPhone event was

730
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,840
Speaker 3:  the iPhone is gonna be incredibly difficult to bring to market in a way that

731
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,520
Speaker 3:  is prosperous.

732
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,440
Speaker 5:  We barely know how to make this thing.

733
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,840
Speaker 3:  And the thing is like Apple didn't make phones at the time. Tesla

734
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,960
Speaker 3:  is an existing high volume car company.

735
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,160
Speaker 5:  The iPhone at the time was barely existent. Like Right. The,

736
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,120
Speaker 5:  all the stories we've heard is like, it barely worked. It's a miracle. The

737
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,720
Speaker 5:  demos came off as well as it did. There were like two of them on earth. Nobody

738
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,200
Speaker 5:  knew how to do anything. And still Steve Jobs got up there and was like,

739
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:07,360
Speaker 5:  it's fine. We got this

740
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,920
Speaker 3:  Today. Apple revolutionizes the phone. Like that's what he's saying. Yeah.

741
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,240
Speaker 3:  So I get and You know, you look at the cover of the book, there's a real

742
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,520
Speaker 3:  Steve Jobs thing happening with Musk.

743
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,280
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah.

744
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,600
Speaker 3:  You can see he's he's now he's saying the lines, right? He's, he's doing

745
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,560
Speaker 3:  covers. I'm just saying the Cybertruck the competition is

746
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:28,560
Speaker 3:  real and exists at volume and scale.

747
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:33,440
Speaker 3:  And the market for electric pickup trucks right now is

748
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,480
Speaker 3:  not great. Yeah. Like you can just go get an F one 50

749
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,440
Speaker 3:  lightning even in the middle of the U aaw strike because

750
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,280
Speaker 3:  the people who wanted them bought them. I think GM just cut back

751
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:49,160
Speaker 3:  production of its electric pickup trucks because they're, they're trying

752
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,840
Speaker 3:  to figure out where the demand is. Mm.

753
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,080
Speaker 4:  I asked a friend who only owns trucks. Yeah. Everybody in our

754
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,080
Speaker 4:  family, they're ranchers, so they all own trucks. Everybody around them only

755
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,680
Speaker 4:  drives trucks. You'll like don't have small children in their parking lots.

756
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,840
Speaker 4:  'cause all the trucks, the trucks are so big. Yeah. Yeah. And I said, are,

757
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,680
Speaker 4:  are you excited about the Cybertruck? It's coming? And she's like, what is

758
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,480
Speaker 4:  that? And I was like, Ooh, that's, yeah. That's like the

759
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,000
Speaker 4:  core. That should be the core audience. Like, oh, you, you drive it all over

760
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,640
Speaker 4:  the ranch and then you come back and you plug it in at night and they're

761
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,520
Speaker 4:  like, who? Yeah. So

762
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,920
Speaker 3:  I, I'm, a lot of people are gonna, a lot of people buy Tesla cars. We should

763
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,960
Speaker 3:  get in the rest of the earnings and we Yeah. Can dive into what that exactly

764
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,640
Speaker 3:  means. I'm just saying this product is entering an incredibly saturated market

765
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,120
Speaker 3:  full of very strong opinions. And its competition

766
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:37,600
Speaker 3:  did not sit still. I think what Musk is talking about here is like

767
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,920
Speaker 3:  stainless steel manufacturing techniques and like

768
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,640
Speaker 3:  unibody casting and that stuff makes the product special,

769
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,920
Speaker 3:  but then it still has to go be a product. And in

770
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,760
Speaker 3:  particular, Alex know pickup truck owners. I know pickup truck owners,

771
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,680
Speaker 3:  if you read pickup truck forms, these are some of the most customized, most

772
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,920
Speaker 3:  highly personalized vehicles that exist. And they

773
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,680
Speaker 4:  Spend a ton of money on them.

774
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,920
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The amount of money you can throw at a pickup truck, they're, they're

775
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,680
Speaker 3:  like platforms unto themselves. And if this one isn't durable and it

776
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,560
Speaker 3:  doesn't work, whew.

777
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:11,280
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

778
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,840
Speaker 3:  Hey, do you think people in America have opinions about pickup trucks? Like

779
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,360
Speaker 3:  if you're driving your a hundred thousand dollars triangle down the road

780
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,240
Speaker 3:  and there's panel gaps, do you do, do you think that the

781
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,880
Speaker 3:  people who've been doing like screaming matches about Ford versus

782
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,280
Speaker 3:  GM for a hundred years Yeah. Are gonna have opinions about this? It's gonna

783
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,520
Speaker 3:  be amazing anyway. November 30th, the first deliveries.

784
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,760
Speaker 3:  But I don't think a regular person, let alone a car reviewer, is gonna get

785
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,840
Speaker 3:  their hands on this thing until next year. Yeah. I think that's right. Maybe

786
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:42,720
Speaker 3:  late next year. So that's the Cybertruck. There was no

787
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,760
Speaker 3:  discussion of the wiper. I know everyone wants to know nothing. There's only

788
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,960
Speaker 3:  one thing I care about. People have seen them, they've taken pictures of

789
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,480
Speaker 3:  the truck. I'm saying if you encounter one of these trucks, don't take pictures

790
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,480
Speaker 3:  of the side. We can know what shape that is.

791
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:01,400
Speaker 3:  Take pictures of the wiper man, get up in it. I want macro

792
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:05,240
Speaker 3:  shots of the wiper. Take the wiper off the

793
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,720
Speaker 3:  Cybertruck and bring it to Neli. I've heard a theory about how that wiper

794
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,560
Speaker 3:  is constructed and none of the images I've seen so far, confirmer,

795
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,400
Speaker 3:  is it gonna like

796
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:13,560
Speaker 4:  Whip?

797
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,080
Speaker 3:  I can't, I don't wanna, it's an unsourced. I don't even wanna put the energy

798
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,280
Speaker 3:  into the world. Okay. It's gonna whip. I need some photographs of this thing

799
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,120
Speaker 3:  up, up close and personal to, to confirm or deny the theory

800
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:25,600
Speaker 3:  that I've heard.

801
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,480
Speaker 3:  I'm not telling you what it's okay.

802
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:36,240
Speaker 3:  Other little Tesla earnings news, the actual money at Tesla

803
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,800
Speaker 3:  was looking pretty weird, right?

804
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's good and bad all at the same time. I think the, the numbers

805
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,480
Speaker 5:  they reported, I, I just wrote it down. It was $23.4 billion in

806
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,320
Speaker 5:  revenue, which was up from the same time last year. Like they're, they're

807
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,560
Speaker 5:  making money, they're selling cars. Earnings weigh down. They made about

808
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,760
Speaker 5:  two little less than $2 billion in profit down from

809
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,520
Speaker 5:  3.3 billion on about the same amount of revenue last year.

810
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:05,280
Speaker 5:  So Tesla has a bunch of reasons for this, right? They're like,

811
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:09,280
Speaker 5:  they are making big upgrades in the factories. So production goes down a

812
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,080
Speaker 5:  little bit, which means you're gonna make less money.

813
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,880
Speaker 5:  Also something something AI and

814
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,440
Speaker 5:  supercomputers that I don't like, I don't know Elon, Musk just like says

815
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,040
Speaker 5:  robots a lot and people are like, oh, that makes sense for your earnings

816
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,000
Speaker 5:  and I don't care about that. The biggest thing is they keep cutting the

817
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,400
Speaker 5:  price. Like these used to be expensive cars and they're really not expensive

818
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,320
Speaker 5:  cars anymore in a lot of places. And I think what is happening

819
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,240
Speaker 5:  is that Tesla is selling more cars because it's making them

820
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:41,080
Speaker 5:  much, much cheaper to get in a time when that

821
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,720
Speaker 5:  is not a lot of company strategy at the moment, which has been sort of

822
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,960
Speaker 5:  fascinating. And Tesla for a long time had like crazy profit margins. Like

823
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,200
Speaker 5:  cars. Nila, you, you probably understand this much better than I do, but

824
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,160
Speaker 5:  my impression is cars are not a high margin industry and for Tesla they have

825
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,320
Speaker 5:  been, and that is starting to go away in a big way. It was like

826
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:02,240
Speaker 4:  20% margin in in some of the earlier years. And now it's

827
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,480
Speaker 4:  like, not

828
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:07,480
Speaker 3:  That most car, big car companies make all of their money on financing.

829
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,920
Speaker 3:  And so they, they have just sort of brought the margin of the cars themselves

830
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,680
Speaker 3:  down because they assume that you're gonna lease the car and

831
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,560
Speaker 3:  they'll make all the money on the lease and then you'll give the car back

832
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,160
Speaker 3:  to them and they'll sell it again at a much higher margin. So like

833
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,800
Speaker 3:  a company like B M W basically assumes they're gonna sell every three series

834
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,720
Speaker 3:  twice. And that's just like baked into the model. And that's why B M W in

835
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,600
Speaker 3:  particular is like CarPlay is here when you lease it and when you buy a pre-owned

836
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,800
Speaker 3:  one, it costs $40. Like Right. They're just, they're, they're able to monkey

837
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,440
Speaker 3:  with it. 'cause they know the dynamics of how they sell that vehicle are

838
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:43,240
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Are not what people expect. Tesla also

839
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,120
Speaker 3:  had the benefit early on of having

840
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,320
Speaker 3:  consolidated basically all of the car into a single compute stack. Right?

841
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,800
Speaker 3:  So like your average GM or Ford vehicle has like 5,000

842
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,840
Speaker 3:  suppliers in it and 5,000 different microcontrollers. And Tesla is like,

843
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,720
Speaker 3:  there's one, right? And, and they consolidate and it was more

844
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,400
Speaker 3:  expensive and it was a harder way to architect a car. And now it's You know

845
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:09,560
Speaker 3:  every car company co will tell you that's what they're gonna do too. But

846
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,280
Speaker 3:  they just had less stuff in the car. Yeah. Less engine stuff, less

847
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,240
Speaker 3:  transmission components, less exhaust stuff, but also more importantly,

848
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:21,200
Speaker 3:  less fewer microcontrollers and computers. And they owned all the

849
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,080
Speaker 3:  code. So they just had this ability to create all that margin. But now if

850
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,000
Speaker 3:  you look at Tesla's financing rates sky high while

851
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,880
Speaker 3:  the big automakers are like back to 0.9% 'cause

852
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,440
Speaker 3:  they just desperately want you to buy a car. You know. And it's like they're,

853
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,800
Speaker 3:  they're fighting a war there where they're just lowering prices. Elon went

854
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,120
Speaker 3:  on a rant about interest rates

855
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,200
Speaker 3:  'cause he hasn't, I don't think they have that business that like the

856
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,120
Speaker 3:  financing business the big car makers do. So like in the middle of this earnings,

857
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,000
Speaker 3:  they asked him something really silly. Right?

858
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:54,720
Speaker 5:  Let's see, he answered a question about the

859
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:58,640
Speaker 5:  Tesla and he compared it to the RAV four for some reason, which I thought

860
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,960
Speaker 5:  was interesting. So he says if our car costs the same as a RAV four, no one

861
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,360
Speaker 5:  would buy a RAV four. Or at least they would be very unlikely to, which is

862
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,160
Speaker 5:  a bold proclamation. But then, then he

863
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,640
Speaker 5:  said, I think since so many people who buy cars,

864
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,800
Speaker 5:  especially in the US can't afford to wait for

865
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,520
Speaker 5:  tax credits or something, our cars still much more expensive than a Rav

866
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,160
Speaker 5:  four when you look at it that way, which is like, I'm not a hundred percent

867
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,400
Speaker 5:  sure what he's talking about, but he's, he's got a lot of thoughts about

868
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,840
Speaker 5:  how people who make a lot of money don't understand what life is like for

869
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,520
Speaker 5:  people who don't make as much money. And I think the case he's trying to

870
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,880
Speaker 5:  make is that it's good that prices are going down, which like, yeah, sure

871
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,840
Speaker 5:  I am, I am pro this. I'm not sure how he ties

872
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:43,000
Speaker 5:  that back to interest rates. Maybe you can make sense.

873
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,120
Speaker 3:  So he's basically like, interest rates are too high, people can't finance

874
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,120
Speaker 3:  these cars. Right. And then he is saying our car's more expensive

875
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,720
Speaker 3:  and so it's even harder to finance them. And that's what I'm saying, Tesla

876
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,360
Speaker 3:  has not built up that like low zero interest

877
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:59,720
Speaker 3:  rate financing. Like that's just not where they've made their money. And

878
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,680
Speaker 3:  you can have like, they're valid opinions. So that's a better way to do it.

879
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,960
Speaker 3:  Like B M W selling every car twice because they assume the first per purchase

880
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,920
Speaker 3:  or will finance or lease it. You can have a lot of opinions, right? I I think

881
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,640
Speaker 3:  you should, but it's just true that in the market today,

882
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,240
Speaker 3:  Tesla just like sells cars.

883
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,960
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, and and it doesn't sell them very well. Like, like this is

884
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,920
Speaker 4:  a company that is actually pretty bad at the whole finance and just like

885
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:23,440
Speaker 4:  right

886
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:26,360
Speaker 3:  On Tesla's website, they're like, here are the three ways you can buy this

887
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,640
Speaker 3:  car. You can finance it, you can lease it, or you can buy it in cash and

888
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,040
Speaker 3:  like they kind of want you to just buy it in cash. Right. And I think they

889
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,920
Speaker 3:  probably sold a lot of mono ss in cash actually.

890
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,640
Speaker 3:  And You know they want to take Bitcoin for their cars. Like they've pioneered

891
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,440
Speaker 3:  a new way and they don't move the prices and there's no negotiation, all

892
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,000
Speaker 3:  that stuff. But what is happening is he's bringing the price of the cars

893
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,720
Speaker 3:  down, reducing the margin, and his investors on the call are

894
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,600
Speaker 3:  asking him, are you also reducing the cost of the car to preserve

895
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,560
Speaker 3:  your margin? And he's got a quote here that says it's like Game

896
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,800
Speaker 3:  of Thrones for pennies. That's how he describes

897
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,840
Speaker 3:  reducing costs mean to Tesla, which is actually a great quote.

898
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,880
Speaker 3:  And I think what is happening is he's feeling all of this pressure from high

899
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,120
Speaker 3:  interest rates, weird economic environments. He calls credit card interest

900
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,720
Speaker 3:  rates. He's serious. Yeah, right. He he's got this real

901
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,560
Speaker 3:  populous streak in him. Yeah. And I, I think what he's

902
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,120
Speaker 3:  basically saying is, the market isn't fair to me

903
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,840
Speaker 3:  at Tesla. Everyone should want to buy my car. Like

904
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,560
Speaker 3:  why are you pushing a RAV four You know. Like you should, you should want

905
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,680
Speaker 3:  a model three, which

906
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,000
Speaker 4:  Is goofy because nobody wants a, I mean a lot of people obviously do want

907
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,840
Speaker 4:  a model three, but it's not a well-made car. Like

908
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,600
Speaker 4:  at a, a RAV four is pretty well made. It's not gonna have enormous panel

909
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,280
Speaker 4:  gaps. I can fit my whole hand in. It's true. I can't

910
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,280
Speaker 4:  guarantee the same on a Tesla.

911
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:52,000
Speaker 3:  Right. And then this all transitioned by the way, into a rant against work

912
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,400
Speaker 3:  from home where David, I believe he compared

913
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:59,760
Speaker 3:  people who work from home to Marie Antoinette, which is pretty good.

914
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:00,120
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

915
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,360
Speaker 5:  It is very good. Yeah. And he, I think the, the question was something relatively

916
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,520
Speaker 5:  benign. Like do you think that more people working from home

917
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:12,320
Speaker 5:  and thus not commuting and caring a lot about gas mileage in their cars might

918
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,960
Speaker 5:  have an effect on, on Tesla, which I would argue is like a perfectly fair

919
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,840
Speaker 5:  question to ask any car company right now. Yeah. And I think that the quote

920
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,840
Speaker 5:  was, yeah, he said these are some real Marie Antoinette vibes

921
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,680
Speaker 5:  from people who say, why doesn't everyone work from home? What about all

922
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,960
Speaker 5:  the people that have to come to the factory and build the cars? Which is

923
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,800
Speaker 5:  a funny thing to say from Elon Musk who has been like very demanding about

924
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,320
Speaker 5:  people coming back to work and all the people who have to go to the restaurant

925
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,880
Speaker 5:  and make your food and deliver your food. It's like, what are you talking

926
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,440
Speaker 5:  about? How detached from reality does the work from home crowd have to be

927
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,400
Speaker 5:  while they take advantage of those who cannot work from home?

928
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:45,900
Speaker 5:  Interesting. Again, sort of populous streak funny thing to say from the guy

929
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,780
Speaker 5:  who has been spelling very expensive electric cars for a really long time

930
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,580
Speaker 5:  and is also the richest man on earth. Yeah.

931
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,620
Speaker 3:  And also by the way, the c e o of four companies, thus

932
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,060
Speaker 3:  by definition working remotely at three jobs at

933
00:57:59,060 --> 00:57:59,380
Speaker 3:  all times

934
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,100
Speaker 5:  And has been very demanding about bringing people back to work.

935
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:07,220
Speaker 3:  Just just saying always working remote. Yeah. If you can, there's

936
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:11,060
Speaker 3:  one person who is definitionally always remote from at least one of his

937
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:11,300
Speaker 3:  jobs.

938
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:17,660
Speaker 3:  It's, he seems like he's getting it done. Hmm. We'll see. So there's

939
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:21,340
Speaker 3:  just a lot going on with Tesla. I think that company, particularly as some

940
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:24,700
Speaker 3:  of the Twitter debt comes due and there's lots of questions about how that

941
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,140
Speaker 3:  will be secured. Yeah. And whether those bankers, that's all Tesla money.

942
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:32,180
Speaker 3:  It's it's propping that up. So just a lot of pressure Yeah. On Tesla

943
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,060
Speaker 3:  right now. Yeah.

944
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:36,660
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it does seem like the, the push that they've been making is to

945
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:40,380
Speaker 5:  make like a thoroughly mainstream, everybody can afford it kind of car.

946
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,860
Speaker 5:  And you can see, I think he said something, it, it

947
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,660
Speaker 5:  was like digging a tunnel with a spoon I think was the way he phrased it.

948
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,380
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And like, I I believe him. Right. Like it's, I think it, it's going

949
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:55,300
Speaker 5:  every dollar to get out of that car from now on in

950
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,940
Speaker 5:  order to make it the price of a like Honda Civic is

951
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:02,820
Speaker 5:  gonna be a fight. And especially in a time when money

952
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,020
Speaker 5:  is hard to come by and lots of things are really expensive for lots of people.

953
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:10,220
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be interesting to see. Yeah. Which is like why you would think

954
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,980
Speaker 5:  the Cybertruck, which is presumably going to be very expensive, would be

955
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,460
Speaker 5:  like a solve for a lot of that stuff. Except they can't figure out how to

956
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,780
Speaker 5:  make it, which seems like a problem.

957
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:21,920
Speaker 4:  It's gonna be like a hundred thousand dollars. Right. I

958
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,720
Speaker 3:  If it ever comes out man, look, all I'm saying is I've heard a rumor about

959
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:29,240
Speaker 3:  the Cybertruck windshield wiper. Yeah. If you can just send me some

960
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:33,280
Speaker 3:  really close photos of it. I'm not gonna tell you what it's two

961
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,560
Speaker 3:  other lightning round pieces of the puzzle. Also important in the context

962
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,360
Speaker 3:  of Tesla in its future. Yes. You can argue about if the cars are

963
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,440
Speaker 3:  well-made or not, not You know. You're to argue they're not. It's really

964
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,280
Speaker 3:  just can you justify, can you, can you make an emotional argument about why

965
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,720
Speaker 3:  it doesn't matter? Sure. You can a lot, lots of people can. Yeah.

966
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:53,800
Speaker 3:  The moat for Teslas for so long is if you are in the market for an EV, they

967
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,640
Speaker 3:  have the single best charging network

968
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:01,200
Speaker 3:  and then they opened up the standard NACS, the Biden administration said,

969
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,990
Speaker 3:  do you want this money? You gotta open your network. Tesla chose the money.

970
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,550
Speaker 3:  They could have not chosen the money. I've, I've seen a lot of people say

971
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:10,350
Speaker 3:  the Biden administration forced Tesla into opening its network.

972
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:14,710
Speaker 3:  If dangling huge sums of money in saying I will give you this money if you

973
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:18,350
Speaker 3:  make this decision is is forced. That's fine. You can believe that that's

974
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:21,510
Speaker 3:  true. But that is the dynamic here. The Biden administration said we're gonna

975
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:24,990
Speaker 3:  invest in charging infrastructure, here's a bunch of money for it. And Tesla

976
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,270
Speaker 3:  said we'd like some of that money. So they open up their network.

977
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:32,390
Speaker 3:  ChargePoint is gonna do NACS plugs into its network

978
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:33,230
Speaker 3:  of

979
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:36,830
Speaker 3:  medium experiences.

980
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:41,750
Speaker 3:  That's Yeah. It's it's fair to say about all of the non Tesla charging network.

981
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:42,150
Speaker 3:  This

982
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:45,590
Speaker 4:  Is the one like you are Yeah. Behind the gas station that you have to charge

983
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:48,390
Speaker 3:  In ChargePoint and Electrify America are like the two big networks. Yeah.

984
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:51,870
Speaker 3:  ChargePoint is the one where like if you were in a small town and you're

985
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:54,910
Speaker 3:  like, is there a charger here? There's like one in front of the library and

986
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:58,910
Speaker 3:  You know like, it's running, it's running on one 20. It's like,

987
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:02,390
Speaker 3:  that's George point. Yeah. El America is like, we've built a thing

988
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:05,790
Speaker 3:  to launder VWs reputation for Keel Gate

989
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:10,790
Speaker 3:  and they're slightly better. Okay. This is, correct me if I'm wrong, but

990
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:12,910
Speaker 3:  this is broadly true of these two networks.

991
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:16,470
Speaker 5:  Yeah, no that's, that's, that's basically right. And no one is very good

992
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:20,430
Speaker 5:  at making chargers that like work over time and aren't broken

993
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,070
Speaker 5:  or wildly complicated whenever you pull into them.

994
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:26,590
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So, but ChargePoint is gonna do it. So, and they have a picture. The

995
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:30,630
Speaker 3:  funniest thing about this is Evie se charging plugs are the

996
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:34,470
Speaker 3:  least exciting thing to take a picture of, but they have to put photos

997
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:38,270
Speaker 3:  in their press releases. So it's just like a guy holding a block.

998
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:40,510
Speaker 4:  Like,

999
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,910
Speaker 3:  I dunno how to describe this. Like here's the photo of us with a Tesla charger

1000
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:45,350
Speaker 3:  and it's like, here's a guy,

1001
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:50,390
Speaker 4:  The photo, he's just hand out. It's like, it's just guy

1002
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:53,910
Speaker 3:  Here's, he's almost charging the car but he isn't You know. It's like great,

1003
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:57,710
Speaker 3:  they're gonna do it. There are other new chargers,

1004
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:02,230
Speaker 3:  a company called Gravity has new, much smaller chargers designed for urban

1005
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:05,550
Speaker 3:  environments. So really fast, actually faster than any car in America to

1006
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:08,270
Speaker 3:  take right now. So you see there's a lot of action on the charging front

1007
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,230
Speaker 3:  because of NACS. Yeah. B m W just said they're gonna do like a bunch of

1008
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:16,190
Speaker 3:  other car companies are gonna start doing this by 2025. So you, you

1009
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:19,400
Speaker 3:  see, okay, this thing will be the standard and we're going to

1010
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:23,080
Speaker 3:  eventually stop talking about the supercharger network as a mote.

1011
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:27,760
Speaker 3:  We're gonna start talking about charging cars and that that, I

1012
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,680
Speaker 3:  think that's gonna change the dynamic of Tesla's yet again. Yeah.

1013
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,440
Speaker 4:  I I I don't think Tesla's long for this world. Like 1515 years.

1014
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:38,520
Speaker 3:  You're crazy. Yeah. I'm sorry. I love you. It's crazy. And I end this by

1015
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,480
Speaker 3:  saying this 'cause I know what you think. Yeah. You think that Teslas have

1016
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:45,200
Speaker 3:  bad build quality and people are going to Yeah. Over time it'll, the

1017
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,560
Speaker 4:  Batteries are all gonna die or explode and people are gonna be pissed.

1018
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,400
Speaker 3:  That's true. All cars people love Range Rovers.

1019
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:52,800
Speaker 3:  Mm.

1020
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:53,880
Speaker 4:  They shouldn't

1021
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:58,000
Speaker 3:  Like a modern Range Rover mostly does not work.

1022
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:00,000
Speaker 4:  Looks pretty.

1023
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:04,120
Speaker 3:  They look amazing. But I like went to buy one or

1024
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,400
Speaker 3:  just like look at one 'cause it's like Becky's dream car. Yeah. And then

1025
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:09,800
Speaker 3:  like people are jumping out bushes being like don't stay away.

1026
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,920
Speaker 4:  My dad was not one of them. He would say Katie

1027
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:12,800
Speaker 3:  Has one. Yeah. He'd

1028
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,760
Speaker 4:  Be like get not anymore.

1029
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,720
Speaker 3:  We did not buy a Range Rover. Good. I'm just saying you right now. But I'm

1030
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:21,440
Speaker 3:  just saying I people love cars. Like they keep selling

1031
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,280
Speaker 3:  Range Rovers, they love them.

1032
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:24,360
Speaker 4:  That's Tesla's future.

1033
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:28,040
Speaker 3:  They keep selling Ford and Chevy pickup trucks. Tesla has fans like that

1034
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,400
Speaker 3:  way longer than 15 years. Yeah, that's All right? We gotta take a break.

1035
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:35,760
Speaker 3:  More lightning round to come but this time they're actually gonna be bolts

1036
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,640
Speaker 3:  of lightning. Not extended deliberations. We'll

1037
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:39,920
Speaker 3:  grab it.

1038
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:54,040
Speaker 3:  All. right? We're back. It has been a very philosophical sort of lightning

1039
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,640
Speaker 3:  show trail.

1040
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:57,800
Speaker 4:  Like let's go back to my, my feelings on Tesla's

1041
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,920
Speaker 3:  Longit. What is a car?

1042
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,720
Speaker 3:  All, right? I've got a few telecom lightning round ones. A few.

1043
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:07,840
Speaker 3:  Just a couple. I'm gonna try to bundle 'em together. All, right? So today

1044
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:12,520
Speaker 3:  McKenna Kelly is in Washington DC as we speak, watching the s e c

1045
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:16,280
Speaker 3:  vote to restore net neutrality, which is not done. But

1046
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:20,160
Speaker 3:  Biden finally fully staffed his FCC did by

1047
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,640
Speaker 3:  the pure failure on Joe Biden's part to just not have a

1048
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,080
Speaker 3:  functioning FCC for most of his administration. Yep. Thus, thus far. But

1049
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:30,520
Speaker 3:  he finally pulled it off. He's got all the people, they're gonna go do it.

1050
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,800
Speaker 3:  A lot of people are gonna tell you it didn't matter, we haven't had it this

1051
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:37,520
Speaker 3:  long. The telecom companies didn't do bad things. No one's

1052
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,320
Speaker 3:  straddled their data. They're lying to you. They're lying to you. They're

1053
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,440
Speaker 3:  lying to you for two reasons. One, there's a bunch of state net neutrality

1054
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:48,360
Speaker 3:  laws in the books in New York and California and all these other big populous

1055
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,200
Speaker 3:  places. And two, the telecom companies have done a bunch

1056
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:55,920
Speaker 3:  of dumb dumb things and blown a lot of money

1057
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:00,280
Speaker 3:  and attempted to do bad things. They were just such

1058
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:04,560
Speaker 3:  horrible ideas. They blew up in their faces and resulted

1059
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:07,800
Speaker 3:  in massive layoffs across the industries that they covered. For example,

1060
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,160
Speaker 3:  a company called at t I dunno if you never heard of them. They're just a

1061
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,880
Speaker 3:  little, little thing you can You know. A funny thing about at t I dunno if

1062
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:19,360
Speaker 3:  people know this, you can actually split it up into hundreds of little

1063
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:23,400
Speaker 3:  companies and it will slowly reform over time. You know it'll just

1064
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,240
Speaker 3:  blob back together. It there is again. And one of

1065
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,840
Speaker 5:  Those companies will be H B O for 10 minutes.

1066
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:31,200
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it's amazing. Anyhow,

1067
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:32,120
Speaker 4:  It's like

1068
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:36,040
Speaker 3:  Mercury lightning round. Anyhow, at t bought

1069
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,960
Speaker 3:  Time Warner in order to zero rate data on its network and make

1070
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:43,000
Speaker 3:  you watch a gray scale Justice league

1071
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,280
Speaker 5:  Because my data cap was the reason I was worried about streaming services

1072
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:47,680
Speaker 5:  that tracks

1073
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:53,960
Speaker 3:  It's a real, it's a real thing. Anyhow, so

1074
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:57,320
Speaker 3:  net neutrality going back in the books, if you are the sort of person who's

1075
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,410
Speaker 3:  generally worried about censorship on the internet,

1076
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,970
Speaker 3:  I would say that free speech online a set of keywords

1077
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:10,170
Speaker 3:  that usually implies people slightly different politics than mine. But

1078
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,890
Speaker 3:  if you are worried about censorship on the internet, you should be worried

1079
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:16,880
Speaker 3:  about it at the pipe layer. Most of all because it is the least transparent,

1080
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:21,320
Speaker 3:  the the least accountable, the least competitive part of

1081
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,920
Speaker 3:  the internet stack. You should say, okay, we should definitely not have any

1082
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,840
Speaker 3:  control over data here. Now I guess I firm, I firmly believe this,

1083
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,960
Speaker 3:  that that is an inappropriate place for any kind of censorship or throttling

1084
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:35,840
Speaker 3:  or business model interference with information. So that's what we're doing.

1085
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:39,520
Speaker 3:  Again, McKenna's there we're gonna have a weird fight about it. Brendan Carr

1086
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:43,400
Speaker 3:  classic bad faith. FCC Huckster is like giving PowerPoint

1087
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,520
Speaker 3:  presentations about, well everything's great with internet access in America

1088
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:48,320
Speaker 3:  that we're gonna cover you again. Does it have

1089
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,720
Speaker 4:  Like a little sponsored by at and t at the bottom of the deck?

1090
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:53,800
Speaker 3:  It's just, it's a death star.

1091
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:01,720
Speaker 3:  Similarly, you might have noticed that I've paid a lot of attention to

1092
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:05,680
Speaker 3:  the end of the five G era as I've taken the calling it. Yeah.

1093
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,360
Speaker 4:  I was like, Neil is looking towards seven G. What are you talking about?

1094
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:08,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1095
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,760
Speaker 3:  Whenever I get one of the PR emails about talking about six G Innovations,

1096
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:15,600
Speaker 3:  I'm like, you dummies, I've been on nine G this whole time.

1097
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,720
Speaker 3:  Turn that frown upside down. Nokia is cutting

1098
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,880
Speaker 3:  14,000 jobs. By the way, do You know what Nokia tells? 80 success employees.

1099
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:28,160
Speaker 3:  They became an infrastructure provider and there

1100
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:31,720
Speaker 3:  was a thought that Huawei would take over the world of infrastructure and

1101
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,440
Speaker 3:  then we like basically banned Huawei. The Europeans basically banned Huawei

1102
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:39,200
Speaker 3:  from providing cellular infrastructure. So companies like Siemens and Nokia

1103
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:42,280
Speaker 3:  all invested heavily into five G equipment. That's the stuff that's running

1104
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,160
Speaker 3:  right now. Nokia has now cut 14,000 jobs.

1105
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:46,960
Speaker 3:  The reason

1106
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:52,720
Speaker 3:  the operators have found it challenging to monetize their five G investments.

1107
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:53,160
Speaker 3:  That's

1108
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,480
Speaker 5:  A quote. Oh that's a quote.

1109
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:58,760
Speaker 3:  That's a quote from, that's a quote from the c e O of Nokia. This is why

1110
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,360
Speaker 3:  we're cutting 14,000 jobs. The operators invested so heavily into five G

1111
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:06,240
Speaker 3:  with no plan. Yeah. To make money

1112
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:10,240
Speaker 3:  and now they're cutting back on their further investment

1113
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:14,360
Speaker 3:  because there's no money here. So we know Kia are cutting 14,000 drops.

1114
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:18,680
Speaker 3:  Here's where you could put a bunch of five G towers. Rural America,

1115
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:20,320
Speaker 4:  But the backhaul. Sure.

1116
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:24,320
Speaker 3:  But I'm just saying like what are the promises of these networks

1117
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:28,120
Speaker 3:  is that you will bring broadband to more people more effectively.

1118
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:32,720
Speaker 3:  That is not done. We have lots of listeners, readers in rural America. We,

1119
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,600
Speaker 3:  Alex and I both care about this quite a bit. Yeah. McKenna caress about it

1120
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,720
Speaker 3:  quite a bit. We pay a lot of attention to it. The broadband deployments,

1121
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,200
Speaker 3:  I don't

1122
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,880
Speaker 5:  Care. Just apparently, I don't care at all about rural broadband. I'm not

1123
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,120
Speaker 5:  interested.

1124
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,400
Speaker 3:  You're a city slicker Pierce,

1125
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:46,000
Speaker 4:  City slicker urban

1126
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Speaker 3:  Cowboy. David Pierce

1127
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,640
Speaker 4:  All. right. Little John Travolta.

1128
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:53,000
Speaker 5:  What floor of a New York skyscraper are you guys on right now?

1129
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:02,040
Speaker 3:  Anyhow, all I'm saying is it, it didn't happen. They did the thing

1130
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,200
Speaker 3:  that they always do. Yeah. They blew a bunch of money. They made a bunch

1131
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,120
Speaker 3:  of promises. They served urban areas and covered the highways of

1132
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:09,400
Speaker 3:  America

1133
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:14,000
Speaker 4:  And nowhere else. I would argue Internet's actually gotten

1134
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,160
Speaker 4:  worse in rural America. Interesting. Like especially phones

1135
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:21,480
Speaker 4:  used to. I could drive from one

1136
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:25,320
Speaker 4:  town to another and my mom's to visit my mom have phone the whole way.

1137
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:28,760
Speaker 4:  And now every time I go down this little hill I say, I'll call you back at

1138
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,320
Speaker 4:  the end of this hill every time. It's very consistent.

1139
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:32,760
Speaker 4:  That's

1140
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,480
Speaker 3:  True. If you stand on a street corner here in New York City under a streetlight.

1141
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,280
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You can get like 10 gigs down.

1142
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,680
Speaker 4:  I just tell my mom, they're like, go, go up to New York. Stand

1143
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:45,600
Speaker 3:  Under, get to that street corner. Look, all I'm saying is the amount of

1144
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,160
Speaker 3:  nationalist rhetoric that we heard about five G. Yep. We have to win the

1145
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:52,880
Speaker 3:  race. Otherwise China will win the race and then they'll be doing the robot

1146
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,760
Speaker 3:  surgery and you'll be, I don't know, working with a

1147
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:00,480
Speaker 3:  shovel for the rest of your life. Do you remember this? I remember it very

1148
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,120
Speaker 3:  clearly. It was last week and I'm still on the hunt

1149
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:08,840
Speaker 3:  for five G applications that require five G at and t released a helmet. They

1150
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:12,760
Speaker 3:  did G at university. I think that's how you pronounce it. They made a

1151
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,520
Speaker 3:  helmet for, for football players who are deaf and has

1152
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,160
Speaker 3:  displays in the visor so they can like call plays and very cool. Where,

1153
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,880
Speaker 4:  Where, where's the football played? Like in rural

1154
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,080
Speaker 4:  America. It's

1155
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,640
Speaker 3:  True. It just, I'm just like looking at this thing, I'm like this is not,

1156
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,720
Speaker 3:  you don't need five G for this helmet.

1157
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:30,760
Speaker 4:  You just need wifi.

1158
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:35,480
Speaker 3:  Good wifi would've gotten you there. Right. This is kind of

1159
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:39,400
Speaker 3:  the level that we're at with this technology to this day. We're

1160
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:42,440
Speaker 3:  pretending that five G is enabling applications. Well and

1161
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,840
Speaker 5:  It's part of the reason stuff like the Noia news is so disappointing is that

1162
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,760
Speaker 5:  we were promised that the reason five G was gonna win was because

1163
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:53,560
Speaker 5:  it was so deployable. You don't have to dig trenches in the same way you

1164
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,480
Speaker 5:  can. You can actually get this thing to people more easily and they

1165
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,120
Speaker 5:  can use it using like devices, infrastructure. They already have

1166
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:05,000
Speaker 5:  sounded good. And now to see everyone pulling back because they can't figure

1167
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,720
Speaker 5:  out how to like immediately monetize this small speed increase

1168
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:12,400
Speaker 5:  that people like the three of us got from five G means

1169
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:15,920
Speaker 5:  the people we're talking about who actually could have benefited from

1170
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:20,040
Speaker 5:  five G being rolled out in their towns where digging trenches is hard work

1171
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,640
Speaker 5:  not gonna happen. That sucks. Yeah. Yeah.

1172
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,680
Speaker 3:  I just can't there the pivot to six G is coming so hard. Just wait,

1173
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,160
Speaker 3:  what? What

1174
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,120
Speaker 4:  Will the surgery be?

1175
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:33,200
Speaker 3:  They're like, they appeal the carrot. It's gonna be amazing. All, right?

1176
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:33,880
Speaker 3:  Cranz, what's yours?

1177
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:37,920
Speaker 4:  Okay, so w w Netflix raised prices again, which

1178
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,360
Speaker 5:  We knew was coming. Yeah, yeah.

1179
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:43,080
Speaker 4:  We knew. We knew it's happening. It's only for two

1180
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:47,400
Speaker 4:  of the plans this time. One is, is the basic plan. It's gonna

1181
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:51,240
Speaker 4:  be 1199. The other is the premium plan, which gets you

1182
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:54,120
Speaker 4:  four K and everything that's gonna be 2299. Ooh,

1183
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:54,920
Speaker 3:  That's right on the,

1184
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,680
Speaker 4:  That's I see. I'm upset but at the same time

1185
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,640
Speaker 4:  I thought I was paying that already for that. So I'm like,

1186
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:04,840
Speaker 4:  this sucks. But

1187
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:08,800
Speaker 3:  All, right. Disclosures. I have an at t account. I have for some time. I'm

1188
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,520
Speaker 3:  a Netflix producer.

1189
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:13,400
Speaker 3:  We made Netflix show, it's called The Future Hub. We can go watch on Netflix

1190
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:16,960
Speaker 3:  for any number of prices apparently, including with ads. There

1191
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,400
Speaker 4:  Is a little, a little silver lining.

1192
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,760
Speaker 3:  We've done a little telecom dunking and I've talked about net neutrality

1193
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,200
Speaker 3:  Comcast through its subsidiary n BBC Universal and Starbucks Media.

1194
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,880
Speaker 3:  I think that's it for now. Yeah. We'll see what else we have to cut into.

1195
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,280
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1196
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1197
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,920
Speaker 5:  Comcast provides my internet and it's very slow most of the time. There you

1198
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:33,040
Speaker 5:  go.

1199
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:36,480
Speaker 3:  We've gotten some notes that like you're not taking 'em seriously. Those

1200
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,880
Speaker 3:  are serious disclosures. Those are all real conflicts that you can evaluate.

1201
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:39,920
Speaker 3:  Yeah. We want you to know

1202
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:44,120
Speaker 4:  The, the only kinda like bright side of this is the basic plan

1203
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,960
Speaker 4:  or the No, the ad supported plan. The 6 99 plan used

1204
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,320
Speaker 4:  to, you couldn't get offline downloads. So if you were gonna go be on a plane

1205
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:54,240
Speaker 4:  sucks to be you. No,

1206
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,160
Speaker 3:  You do you get the ads to the offline downloads. I don't know. The idea of

1207
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,360
Speaker 3:  paying money to download someone else's ads is a lot that said we run,

1208
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,480
Speaker 5:  That seems fine To me that's like, that doesn't bother me at all. And they'll,

1209
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,880
Speaker 5:  they'll get good at like dynamic ads the way that like podcasts work. There's

1210
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,320
Speaker 5:  a good chance if you're listening to this show, you've heard dynamically

1211
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,200
Speaker 5:  placed ads based on what you downloaded. If

1212
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,800
Speaker 3:  There's one thing that I've list I've heard from our listeners is that our

1213
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,240
Speaker 3:  dynamic ads work great. Yeah.

1214
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:18,920
Speaker 5:  It's perfect. Nothing ever goes wrong with dynamic ad placement, but no,

1215
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:22,560
Speaker 5:  what's truly wild to me about this is, so the, the thing you get

1216
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:27,320
Speaker 5:  for the premium price, which is $23 now, is you get four

1217
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,320
Speaker 5:  K streaming and I believe you get four at a

1218
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,120
Speaker 5:  time. So like you can you up to four people can be

1219
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,760
Speaker 5:  watching. Which isn't really true because of the way that the password sharing

1220
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,680
Speaker 5:  stuff works. So like I used to have the four screens account because it

1221
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,360
Speaker 5:  was feasible that four different people might be using our account at the

1222
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,720
Speaker 5:  same time. That's probably not realistic for most people anymore. So I think

1223
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,760
Speaker 5:  you're already probably overpaying, but that's also the only way to get four

1224
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,160
Speaker 5:  K. So if that's a thing you care about, Netflix just knows it can charge

1225
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:58,840
Speaker 5:  you whatever you want. But you can now get the ad

1226
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,680
Speaker 5:  supported version on six screens for

1227
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:06,640
Speaker 5:  less than the cost of the premium account. Like it, it's just so transparent

1228
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,520
Speaker 5:  that Netflix will charge you whatever it has to in order to get you to

1229
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,480
Speaker 5:  switch to ads. Like that's just what it is going to be. They're going to

1230
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:17,440
Speaker 5:  price gouge you until you switch to ads. Yep. And the upper limit of that

1231
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:21,440
Speaker 5:  godly nose like premium might cost $50 in a year because if

1232
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:25,040
Speaker 5:  there will be pe it's like the people who still pay for a o l on disks, there

1233
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,240
Speaker 5:  will be some of those people. Yeah. And Netflix will gouge them for every

1234
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:28,960
Speaker 5:  penny they're worth.

1235
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:32,920
Speaker 3:  So we, I understand the dynamics of this pretty easily, right? We have a

1236
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:36,760
Speaker 3:  lot of people who ask us why you can't just pay us turn off ads. And

1237
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,600
Speaker 3:  the answer is if you just look at the revenue

1238
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:44,680
Speaker 3:  drop that would cause the price I would have to make you pay

1239
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:46,000
Speaker 5:  More than you think

1240
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:50,080
Speaker 3:  Be too high. Especially in a market where like

1241
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:53,560
Speaker 3:  the basic thing that we provide, which is tech news is readily available

1242
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:57,520
Speaker 3:  for free all the time. Like kids on TikTok, just reading Verge

1243
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,160
Speaker 3:  articles is a thing that I, I can't price outta the market. Right. I think

1244
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,360
Speaker 3:  Netflix is discovering the same thing, but

1245
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:07,120
Speaker 4:  The bigger issue is for me as a big media

1246
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:11,000
Speaker 4:  nerd is four K. The only way I can get four K is to be price

1247
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,440
Speaker 4:  gouged and like

1248
01:17:12,490 --> 01:17:15,600
Speaker 3:  Right. 'cause they know that, that there's like perfect price elasticity

1249
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,440
Speaker 3:  there. If you want four K Yep. If you're us, yeah. There's a

1250
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:23,400
Speaker 3:  0% chance I'm paying anyone anything for less than four K. Yeah.

1251
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:27,320
Speaker 4:  I, the, the, the only reason I do it is for four k I don't have four

1252
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:30,200
Speaker 4:  TVs running Netflix in my house all the time. I should,

1253
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,720
Speaker 3:  You get those data caps Alex,

1254
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:34,920
Speaker 4:  Just hit 'em. Use that Fios and

1255
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,440
Speaker 5:  I, I guarantee you Netflix is going to spend the next three years

1256
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:42,360
Speaker 5:  testing that theory of you. Like the question is, will you

1257
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:46,240
Speaker 5:  cancel before you switch to hd? Yeah. That's the thing Netflix

1258
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:47,320
Speaker 5:  is trying to figure out.

1259
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,000
Speaker 4:  Yes, I will cancel before I switch to hd.

1260
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:54,120
Speaker 5:  I don't believe you and I don't think Netflix does either, but we're, we're

1261
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:54,800
Speaker 5:  gonna test that theory.

1262
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:58,920
Speaker 4:  They don't know. What I know about websites on the internet

1263
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:00,520
Speaker 4:  sucks to be,

1264
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:04,480
Speaker 3:  We're just gonna start writing headlines that are like the four K on

1265
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,520
Speaker 3:  h b o Max is free. You know. Yeah. Like just shaming them into

1266
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,640
Speaker 3:  competing. That's, that's our function in journalism. It's

1267
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:13,400
Speaker 4:  True. It's true. David,

1268
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:15,400
Speaker 3:  Take your Spotify victory lap.

1269
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,160
Speaker 5:  Mine's very quick and it's just because I'm very proud of myself. I said

1270
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,440
Speaker 5:  on this show not terribly long ago that Spotify

1271
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:25,360
Speaker 5:  should stop mucking around with trying to be the TikTok for audio

1272
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:29,440
Speaker 5:  or whatever that means. And just try to win at music because for

1273
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:33,120
Speaker 5:  all of the stuff going on in the world and all of the audio things out there,

1274
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,520
Speaker 5:  we actually don't have a really great music app at this moment in time.

1275
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:40,840
Speaker 5:  There are a lot of like Apple music nerds who are gonna email me and tell

1276
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:43,560
Speaker 5:  me why I'm wrong. But you're wrong. Apple Music is not a good product either.

1277
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:47,600
Speaker 5:  They're all bad. And Spotify appears to be

1278
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,320
Speaker 5:  slowly taking my advice. It has sold merch through

1279
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:54,560
Speaker 5:  Spotify for a long time. If that's a thing you want to do, there are tools

1280
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:58,320
Speaker 5:  for that. But it has now rolling out a, a dedicated

1281
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,680
Speaker 5:  hub for artist merch on Spotify.

1282
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:05,760
Speaker 5:  This is a thing you're gonna start to see a lot of, you're gonna see merch,

1283
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,200
Speaker 5:  you're gonna see ticket sales, you're gonna see all kinds of ancillary.

1284
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:13,120
Speaker 5:  So you like this music, here's how we can make money from you stuff coming

1285
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:17,000
Speaker 5:  to Spotify. But I just, I, Andrew Marino, our producer went back and

1286
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,760
Speaker 5:  found the TikTok that we published of me saying this and I was exactly right

1287
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,720
Speaker 5:  and I'm very proud of myself And also, good job, Spotify. Stop trying

1288
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,760
Speaker 5:  to pretend that all the other stuff you're doing is gonna work. Exclusive

1289
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,920
Speaker 5:  podcasts. Were a stupid business. You wasted a lot of money.

1290
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:32,720
Speaker 5:  Merch is actually gonna work.

1291
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:37,160
Speaker 3:  Tech companies are really bad at being media companies. The only tech companie

1292
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:40,360
Speaker 3:  that's ever been good at being a media company, Netflix, you don't think

1293
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:40,840
Speaker 3:  they're a good media.

1294
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:44,560
Speaker 5:  I think there are a lot of people who argue. Netflix was never really a tech

1295
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,960
Speaker 5:  company. That Netflix was always a media company masquerading as a tech company.

1296
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:48,160
Speaker 5:  It

1297
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,000
Speaker 4:  Was never a tech company and

1298
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,040
Speaker 5:  Got valued like a tech company.

1299
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,160
Speaker 4:  I would agree. But it's also, it's a bad media company. It is

1300
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:57,440
Speaker 4:  not a very well run media company because it can't put out bangers.

1301
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,440
Speaker 4:  It puts out like maybe

1302
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:01,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah, but you're paying $23 a month for that Alex.

1303
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:06,120
Speaker 4:  I know. It's because I'm watching Ugly Betty right now and I don't have it

1304
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:06,800
Speaker 4:  on D v d

1305
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:11,120
Speaker 3:  All. right. Well, email us. Tell us, tell us if you will quit.

1306
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:15,120
Speaker 3:  Tell us your price Netflix before you drop four K I'm actually really curious

1307
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,600
Speaker 3:  where, where the audience is on this. I this is a

1308
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,480
Speaker 3:  self-selecting group. I think I already know the answer, but I I would like

1309
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:26,040
Speaker 3:  a little data from the VIRs audience. Will you quit Netflix

1310
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:30,160
Speaker 3:  before you downgrade from the four K plan and tell me why.

1311
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,280
Speaker 3:  'cause I'm, I'm sort of desperate to know. I think I'm gone before I lose

1312
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:38,160
Speaker 3:  four K. I don't believe that for one second. Yeah. I have a, I'm married

1313
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:41,440
Speaker 3:  to someone who watches a lot of comedy on Netflix who probably doesn't care.

1314
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:44,720
Speaker 3:  And that peacock, this is gonna be a, this is gonna be a whole conversation.

1315
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,000
Speaker 3:  We have

1316
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:45,760
Speaker 2:  Frazier's on

1317
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,760
Speaker 3:  Paramount. We're gonna be, we're watching like ads supported SD comedy specials

1318
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,600
Speaker 3:  in our house before I drop this thing. All, right? That's it. We're way over.

1319
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:55,800
Speaker 3:  Liam's spitting mad. He's not actually, he's smiling. He loves it.

1320
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,960
Speaker 3:  Everyone write Liam a nice note, a nice note. We'll see it later.

1321
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:04,440
Speaker 3:  Lots of great stuff on the site this week. There's a bunch of YouTube news

1322
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,840
Speaker 3:  actually, like incremental YouTube changes that are really interesting, including

1323
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:11,880
Speaker 3:  an AI feature where when people say like, and subscribe, the bell starts

1324
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:15,560
Speaker 3:  shaking, which is just hilarious. Like a perfect creator economy moment.

1325
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:20,360
Speaker 3:  Gen Tuy has a great piece on Ecobee and it's like ever

1326
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,880
Speaker 3:  expanding ambitions in the home. She compares it to Nest. The headline is

1327
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:27,800
Speaker 3:  it's becoming the company Nest wanted to be. If You know anything about me

1328
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,600
Speaker 3:  and The Verge You know that we start, our first big feature was on

1329
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,480
Speaker 3:  Nest. Like I wrote it with Tony Fidel and I remember him telling me his

1330
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,720
Speaker 3:  ambitions for the company. It obviously like failed in spectacular fashion

1331
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:42,640
Speaker 3:  because of Google So. I loved this piece about Ecobee B and how they're building

1332
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:46,560
Speaker 3:  up their ecosystem. Very cool. All kinds of other great stuff on

1333
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,200
Speaker 3:  the site. And then we would be remiss to not note that

1334
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,920
Speaker 3:  there's a war happening in Israel and Gaza. We have a lot of coverage with

1335
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,120
Speaker 3:  the information space of that war on our site. There's a lot going on with

1336
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,840
Speaker 3:  misinformation. Misinformation. I just need to take a break

1337
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:04,400
Speaker 3:  from it. During The Vergecast, I, many of our listeners have told us the

1338
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,560
Speaker 3:  same, but there's a lot of coverage on the site. We're taking that stuff

1339
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:10,480
Speaker 3:  seriously. Go look at that. Particularly what is going on

1340
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,280
Speaker 3:  in Europe with the Digital Services Act and the European governments. Being

1341
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,840
Speaker 3:  able to issue take down requests of social networks is new

1342
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,920
Speaker 3:  and it's gonna have a lot of implications for a lot of things in the future.

1343
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:23,480
Speaker 3:  Okay. That's all on the site. That's it. That's for our Chest rock roll.
