Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Hard Copy peripherals.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,480
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce, and while I'm not doing anything interesting

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,780
Speaker 2:  today because it's been raining for like a week and there's nowhere to go,

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,600
Speaker 2:  and so all I do now is sit here and try to get my hands on an

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,360
Speaker 2:  iPhone 14 Pro Max. The phrase not available today

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,280
Speaker 2:  at 12 nearest stores is starting to drive me truly, truly

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,020
Speaker 2:  insane. Every day. I check every day, it's not available. Anyway,

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,600
Speaker 2:  fun show. Coming up today we're gonna talk a bunch more about the Kindle

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,960
Speaker 2:  Scribe, including with the executive in charge of it at Amazon, and we're

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,680
Speaker 2:  gonna try to see where it fits into the broader EIN tablet

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,000
Speaker 2:  market. We're also gonna dig into the printer industry and try to figure

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,970
Speaker 2:  out why it feels like printers haven't changed or improved

14
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,800
Speaker 2:  in decades. And then we're gonna put Apple's new AirPods Pro and

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,420
Speaker 2:  some other new models up to our brutal earbuds microphone test.

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,480
Speaker 2:  All that's coming in just a second, but first I'm gonna see if I can get

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,400
Speaker 2:  a phone in like Indiana. Wish me luck. This is the Vergecast.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:03,960
Speaker 2:  See you in a

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,570
Speaker 2:  second.

20
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,220
Speaker 1:  Welcome

21
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,020
Speaker 2:  Back Today, the first thing I wanna do is dive back into Amazon's

22
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,740
Speaker 2:  event last week, specifically the Kindle scribe, the new

23
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,540
Speaker 2:  10.2 inch EIN tablet that's meant for both reading and writing.

24
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,220
Speaker 4:  Scribe does this with the world's first 10.2 inch, 300

25
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,780
Speaker 4:  PPI adjustable front light display.

26
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,380
Speaker 2:  I think this thing is kind of sneakily fascinating. It's called a

27
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,250
Speaker 2:  Kindle. Yes, but even to hear Amazon describe it, this is

28
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,120
Speaker 2:  definitely more than just a raving device. It's about way more than just

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,000
Speaker 2:  selling you more books. Alex Kranz, as I'm sure you know, is my comrade in

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,280
Speaker 2:  All Things Inc. Right after the event last week, she and I spent some time

31
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,080
Speaker 2:  with Dave Limp, who's the senior vice president of devices and services at

32
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,840
Speaker 2:  Amazon, which basically means he's the guy in charge of all of Amazon's gadgets

33
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,640
Speaker 2:  and we asked him to give us some of the big picture plans for the

34
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,240
Speaker 2:  Kindle going forward. First I wanna play you a bit of that conversation and

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,520
Speaker 2:  then Alex and I are gonna talk a bit about where we think the Kindle Scribe

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,360
Speaker 2:  fits into the market. So let's just get into it. Here's

37
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,080
Speaker 2:  Dave Limp. When we asked him why make this device now and

38
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,660
Speaker 2:  more importantly in a world where lots of startups and companies are

39
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,120
Speaker 2:  making EIN tablets like this one, what took so long?

40
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's the Kindle I think the team wanted to build for a long time too,

41
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,080
Speaker 4:  but sometimes you know, you have to wait for the technology to catch up to

42
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,950
Speaker 4:  the vision. And so I think there's two

43
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,640
Speaker 4:  things that converged to make this

44
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,600
Speaker 4:  possible. The first is the display technology and our ability

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,560
Speaker 4:  to build a display stack up. That made sense cuz you know,

46
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,520
Speaker 4:  we could have built a writing only device years ago, but you can't put Kindle

47
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,640
Speaker 4:  on that. Like it has to be world class reading experience so you don't get

48
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,320
Speaker 4:  to use the name Kindle, it would had to be some new name. So there's some

49
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,800
Speaker 4:  things that we have to have in a paper white display and these days if you're

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,670
Speaker 4:  not 300 ppi, it's, it's a non-starter. If you can't

51
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,560
Speaker 4:  do a front light that is really uniform and beautiful, people have

52
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,480
Speaker 4:  just come to expect that from Kindle now. And so that display stack

53
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,160
Speaker 4:  up took a little bit longer than we would've thought. Secondarily, then you

54
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,000
Speaker 4:  have to build a writing experience. I would call it a

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,760
Speaker 4:  whole experience that is up to what people expect from writing and you

56
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,720
Speaker 4:  know, the state of the art of writing on things has moved forward

57
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,280
Speaker 4:  a long way. And so you have to have the latency and you have to have it very,

58
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,680
Speaker 4:  it has to feel like writing and so you get to play with various wave forms

59
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,560
Speaker 4:  on the ink display and once those converge then we felt like we could

60
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,740
Speaker 4:  build something we loved. And so here it is.

61
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,180
Speaker 5:  You talked about like the display technology being kind of up to

62
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,980
Speaker 5:  snuff. We've had these 300 kind of PPI displays in

63
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,500
Speaker 5:  smaller forms. Was it really you needed a 310

64
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,540
Speaker 5:  plus inches?

65
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,580
Speaker 4:  Yeah, there's probably a dimension in there. I think you could probably,

66
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,060
Speaker 4:  you know, anywhere from 9.7 inches up to

67
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,980
Speaker 4:  probably 1111, you could have built a form factor but you want it big. Like

68
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,740
Speaker 4:  what you find with writing is writing on something small. Those we have in

69
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,180
Speaker 4:  the lab too is it's just doesn't, it's not comfortable. You end up

70
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,780
Speaker 4:  feeling cramped how you're writing and it, it doesn't really make sense.

71
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,700
Speaker 4:  I even find that writing on small tablets, you know, it doesn't work as well.

72
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,140
Speaker 4:  You kind of wanna put your palm down, you wanna rest it. So there was kind

73
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,760
Speaker 4:  of a sweet spot for the display. I think the side effect of

74
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,580
Speaker 4:  that was, and again we'll know more once more customers see it, but at

75
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,420
Speaker 4:  least from our beta participants, and I can speak for myself, is

76
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,330
Speaker 4:  that the reading experiences surprisingly better. I mentioned this somebody

77
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,060
Speaker 4:  yesterday, I, we used to have a 9.7 inch Kindle product was called

78
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,600
Speaker 4:  Kindle DX a long time ago, right when I got to Amazon and there's not a lot

79
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,240
Speaker 4:  of those left active I I, I should get the actual count but I,

80
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,800
Speaker 4:  it's probably thousands of them left. But they're the most

81
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,730
Speaker 4:  passionate vocal minority I've ever met. I probably get an email on the

82
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,570
Speaker 4:  Kindle DX alias once a week from somebody plant saying please make

83
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,040
Speaker 4:  another dx. And so we didn't call it that this time, but hopefully those

84
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,640
Speaker 4:  customers will find a path to upgrade to this. So

85
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,280
Speaker 5:  Some of the competitors in this space, like in the United States, we don't

86
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,020
Speaker 5:  see a lot of EIN stuff. I think Amazon, you guys are the biggest seller

87
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,400
Speaker 5:  of EIN products, but in China we're seeing a ton of

88
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,280
Speaker 5:  these eReaders and these ere products from like big me and books and stuff

89
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,110
Speaker 5:  like that. But they're funky. I would not have my,

90
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,870
Speaker 5:  my siblings or my mom used one. I've tried and

91
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,200
Speaker 5:  it's ends and failure and sadness. But is it because

92
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,720
Speaker 5:  that ecosystem for E Inc is just not developed enough to go to like

93
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,430
Speaker 5:  say Android and and do full Android or kind of the full

94
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,630
Speaker 5:  Kindle tablet experience in an e ink form?

95
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think there's two reasons we haven't gone that direction. I mean

96
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,280
Speaker 4:  yeah you can buy an infinite number of probably, you know,

97
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,160
Speaker 4:  reflective display kinds of things out of China. Firstly, and I'm just kind

98
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,640
Speaker 4:  of back to what I've said in the beginning, which is you know, we wanted

99
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,320
Speaker 4:  it to be a great reading experience and writing. If you were designing a

100
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,040
Speaker 4:  writing only product, you would do many different things differently, right

101
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,720
Speaker 4:  in the form factor in how you would lay out the board everything. But I

102
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,140
Speaker 4:  think secondarily when you look at this

103
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,880
Speaker 4:  product can describe in this case we really worked

104
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,800
Speaker 4:  at getting something that when we did add writing it felt

105
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,240
Speaker 4:  like a natural extension of it. Sometimes when you think about how some of

106
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,930
Speaker 4:  those other products they feel like they're tacked on to a

107
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,920
Speaker 4:  tablet os yeah and you know, I don't think customers care what operating

108
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,760
Speaker 4:  system is running inside of a Kindle. They care that the reading's great

109
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,720
Speaker 4:  and now the writing's great and the other thing that comes along with

110
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,480
Speaker 4:  those I mentioned in the launch event, but is one of the things I

111
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,160
Speaker 4:  love about Kindle is it is distraction free.

112
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,040
Speaker 4:  It's very subtle but when I'm reading I really don't want to get

113
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,000
Speaker 4:  the notifications. You know, I have a couple VIP contexts and they pop through

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,640
Speaker 4:  almost everything on my phone. One being my wife, the other being my boss.

115
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,370
Speaker 4:  And so I, but I don't want that when I'm deep into a book and I love

116
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,200
Speaker 4:  it. So I think that having a more bespoke solution

117
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,120
Speaker 4:  gives you some of those side benefits without having to block them or or

118
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,280
Speaker 4:  hack the os or do other things.

119
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,240
Speaker 2:  What do you make of this sort of state of this market? Obviously it's

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,080
Speaker 2:  a lot more people own these things in countries like China than do in the

121
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,080
Speaker 2:  States, but there's also a couple of companies out there like Remarkable

122
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,680
Speaker 2:  who have been making these things for a little while. Like where are we in

123
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,520
Speaker 2:  the, in the evolution of like this particular space?

124
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,430
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I don't, I haven't tracked too closely the

125
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,280
Speaker 4:  writing only market segment, you know, of people that are just after

126
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,880
Speaker 4:  a writing for all I know they're doing well. I don't know, I can't really

127
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,800
Speaker 4:  opine upon that. I do think that the pandemic, you know, you was

128
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,510
Speaker 4:  an awful experience in any, by any dimension.

129
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,160
Speaker 4:  One silver lining of it was that people did rediscover

130
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,040
Speaker 4:  reading, you know, and I think reading leads to better literacy and I, I

131
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,080
Speaker 4:  just think people are more educated if they read more. And so I think that

132
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,630
Speaker 4:  was a, a side benefit. And so the

133
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,490
Speaker 4:  Kindle, call it readers in general but I can speak for the

134
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,040
Speaker 4:  Kindle, it started growing pretty substantially during

135
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,880
Speaker 4:  the pandemic and lots of categories this year are not growing in

136
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,840
Speaker 4:  consumer electronics cuz there was a lot of pent up demand that got pulled

137
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,800
Speaker 4:  forward into the pandemic. Were also in a different economy than we were

138
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,760
Speaker 4:  last year at this time. But Kindle continues to grow. It's a category that's

139
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,520
Speaker 4:  been around for 15 years. I wouldn't say it's one of these things where it's

140
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,310
Speaker 4:  you know, hyper growth again. But I do find that people are kind

141
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,960
Speaker 4:  of circling back to the classics in some way. In the case of

142
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,720
Speaker 4:  Kindle reading, there's a whole generation of people growing up now that

143
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,320
Speaker 4:  are kind of also loving physical books again, you know, we see that on Amazon.

144
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,240
Speaker 4:  So there's some interesting trends happening and I think by bringing

145
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,760
Speaker 4:  writing and and merging it together, you know, I think we'll find Kindle

146
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,240
Speaker 4:  lovers that will also love this. But I think we might find a whole new audience

147
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,840
Speaker 4:  that might adopt this. I don't know how big that is but you know, we always

148
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,600
Speaker 4:  kind of start with the products we want and we write that working backwards

149
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,350
Speaker 4:  sometimes we are the customer that's in mind and you know, this is definitely

150
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,600
Speaker 4:  the Kindle that I want.

151
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,440
Speaker 2:  I did have that thought in the briefing ahead of this that like if any

152
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,400
Speaker 2:  company was ever gonna create this, it would be the one that is famous for

153
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,440
Speaker 2:  having six page documents that everybody reads at the beginning of a meeting.

154
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,120
Speaker 2:  It's like, yeah of course, of course. The executives that Amazon would like

155
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,360
Speaker 2:  a device like this to work

156
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,000
Speaker 4:  With. Here's my morning right here, whole pile of six page documents. There

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,880
Speaker 4:  you go. So if you want, if you want to know what next year's products will

158
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,080
Speaker 4:  look like that it's sitting right next to me. So

159
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,400
Speaker 5:  Just like flip that around to the camera. Yeah,

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,960
Speaker 2:  Just hold it up. You don't have to say anything

161
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,000
Speaker 4:  Purposely held it from backwards forward and says so you didn't, didn't get

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,680
Speaker 4:  a glimpse of

163
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,720
Speaker 4:  the

164
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,280
Speaker 4:  future.

165
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,200
Speaker 2:  We're done with Dave Limp back in the studio, me and Alex. Hi Alex.

166
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,560
Speaker 5:  Hi. This is a good time. He's

167
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,120
Speaker 2:  A good hang. I like Dave Limp. He talks about technology and doesn't

168
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,480
Speaker 2:  sound always like a person who runs a technology company, which I, I

169
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,320
Speaker 2:  appreciate, appreciate

170
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,910
Speaker 5:  It. It's

171
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,350
Speaker 2:  Nice. I want to talk more about like this market the Kindle scribe is coming

172
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,280
Speaker 2:  into. Yeah. Because I think the EIN writing

173
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,240
Speaker 2:  tablet feels like an idea that is overdue and has

174
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,720
Speaker 2:  kind of happened already and feels like it's maybe happening more than

175
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,640
Speaker 2:  people realize. But if I'm not mistaken, and correct me if I'm

176
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,320
Speaker 2:  wrong, this kind of seems like if you and I could have sat here and

177
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,000
Speaker 2:  tried to force Amazon to build the relatively

178
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,510
Speaker 2:  reasonable Kindle we wanted, it would've been a lot like this,

179
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,030
Speaker 2:  right?

180
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I would've preferred some some page turning buttons and

181
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,390
Speaker 5:  I would've preferred the ability like actual Android but Kindle

182
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,320
Speaker 5:  was, Amazon is never gonna be like, yes we're gonna put Android on your device

183
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,880
Speaker 5:  so you can get all of our competitors and use their book readers. Like of

184
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,280
Speaker 5:  course they're not gonna do that.

185
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Speaker 2:  That is true. I actually hadn't even thought about that. But it is like totally

186
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,400
Speaker 2:  anathema to the whole business model of Kindle because their whole thing

187
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,340
Speaker 2:  is they don't make money on the hardware, they make money when you buy the

188
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,200
Speaker 2:  books. And if he's gonna let us get cheaper things to read elsewhere, what

189
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,080
Speaker 2:  is the point of Kindle for Amazon? I hadn't even thought about that.

190
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,920
Speaker 5:  I get why they elected not to put Android on it. Do I want

191
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,720
Speaker 5:  Android on it? Yes. Do I understand why Amazon is almost never gonna

192
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,520
Speaker 5:  do that? Yes.

193
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,600
Speaker 2:  Take me through the competition here a little bit because I know I'm in a

194
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,160
Speaker 2:  position where like I am hopelessly devoted to Amazon at this point. I've

195
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,360
Speaker 2:  just spent so long buying Kindle books that I'm just gonna keep reading on

196
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,160
Speaker 2:  Kindles because that's just what I have. But you are not in that boat, which

197
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,560
Speaker 2:  means you have a much freer reign of what's out there. So what is out there?

198
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,080
Speaker 5:  I mean there is a lot out there. There are some people who are making just

199
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,760
Speaker 5:  note taking devices and reading's kind of an afterthought and I think

200
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,600
Speaker 5:  Remarkable is obviously the most well known of those guys. People

201
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,840
Speaker 2:  Like the new remarkable right? They're remarkable too.

202
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,420
Speaker 5:  Yeah, they're remarkable too. They like it because it really is just about

203
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,360
Speaker 5:  writing, you know, Remarkable went out of their way to say how can we

204
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,280
Speaker 5:  replicate that, that pin and paper experience in EIN and they do it

205
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,080
Speaker 5:  better than anybody else, like hands down just better than anybody else.

206
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,760
Speaker 5:  Everybody else, there's little like sacrifices you have to make and it's

207
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,400
Speaker 5:  cheaper too than the describe right? But also you are not

208
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,160
Speaker 5:  getting Amazon, you are not getting e-books. You can put eBooks on

209
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,960
Speaker 5:  a remarkable, you can put PDFs on a remarkable, you can do a lot with remarkable,

210
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,440
Speaker 5:  but it's, it's fussy. Okay. It's not like a super

211
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,280
Speaker 5:  smooth experience, especially for ere because most people

212
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,800
Speaker 5:  are buying their books from Amazon and then they have to convert them and

213
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,480
Speaker 5:  then put them on the remarkable, nobody wants to do that. Right? And then

214
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,280
Speaker 5:  there's also like the SuperNote, which is really similar like to

215
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,920
Speaker 5:  the remarkable, very focused on the writing experience, very focused on being

216
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,800
Speaker 5:  on replicating that kind of like a four paper experience, which is

217
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,480
Speaker 5:  why it's called like the A five and the A six. Thank you to listeners. Somebody

218
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,680
Speaker 5:  said Alex, why do you never mention the super note? And it's because I always

219
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,840
Speaker 5:  forget the super note exists. So here I am for you guys reminding people

220
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,080
Speaker 5:  that the super note does exist and people like it. Like it's, it's got a

221
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,880
Speaker 5:  very small, very passionate fandom and then once you kind of start to

222
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,530
Speaker 5:  move away from that, you start to see it's primarily like these Android

223
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,200
Speaker 5:  EIN tablets that we've talked about before. And for me the the

224
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,640
Speaker 5:  absolute standout there is the books. I've been using 'em for two or three

225
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,280
Speaker 5:  years now and I really love the products. I think they

226
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,160
Speaker 5:  are on the right track, but it's also, I'm never gonna buy

227
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,940
Speaker 5:  my mom a books. I tried to get her to use one last

228
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,840
Speaker 5:  Christmas did not go well. Just like the worst thing I've

229
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,680
Speaker 5:  ever done, worse than the time I tried to set up a password manager for her.

230
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,560
Speaker 2:  Oh wow. Awful. But it seems like the books thing, I have never actually used

231
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,120
Speaker 2:  one of these devices I should say. And it seems to me that what

232
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,960
Speaker 2:  they're basically trying to be is just a full on Android tablet

233
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,920
Speaker 2:  but instead of like an L E D or LCD screen, it has an E

234
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,720
Speaker 2:  Ink screen. But it like other than that it's trying to make as few changes

235
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,480
Speaker 2:  as possible. Is that right? Right.

236
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,680
Speaker 5:  I don't think that's necessarily the purpose. Like it really wants to be

237
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,400
Speaker 5:  an e-reader. It really wants to be a note taking device. Okay. It just says,

238
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Speaker 5:  oh you want the Play store? Yeah we can give you the Play store. Is it gonna

239
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,320
Speaker 5:  be a good experience? No because the play store is not designed for eating

240
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,720
Speaker 5:  and everything's gonna be slowed okay and obnoxious. But if you wanna use

241
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,040
Speaker 5:  your Nook reading app, if you wanna use Libby, if you wanna use the Cobo

242
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,600
Speaker 5:  app, you can use all of those. That's what I do. That's why I, that was why

243
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,240
Speaker 5:  I initially went that route, right? Was because I wanted to get away from

244
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,960
Speaker 5:  Amazon, I wanted to try and have that experience without being locked

245
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,760
Speaker 5:  into Amazon and that seemed like the best choice.

246
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,520
Speaker 2:  So why doesn't that work? That sounds like the dream.

247
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,040
Speaker 5:  I think that is the dream. I think right now it's not user friendly. My like

248
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,000
Speaker 5:  for me the the kind of mark is my mom loves to read, can I give my

249
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,770
Speaker 5:  mom this e-reader and she just go and read

250
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:38,440
Speaker 5:  and no one does that well except for Amazon. And Amazon only does it well

251
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,680
Speaker 5:  with Amazon products. Cobos out there saying, well would we do it too? And

252
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,640
Speaker 5:  also you can go to the library through us and that's not true because I

253
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,400
Speaker 5:  got my mom a Cobo reader and you guys can all do the next time

254
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,240
Speaker 5:  she calls to try to figure out how to get check out a book on the Cobra

255
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,760
Speaker 5:  reader, we'll just have it do on the vergecast. We'll just spend an hour

256
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,200
Speaker 5:  and a half on the Vergecast teaching my mom how to do it. Her and the librarians

257
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,060
Speaker 5:  at her local library. So most of the experiences just aren't user

258
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,440
Speaker 5:  friendly and that's because nobody in the United States really cares about

259
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,320
Speaker 5:  that, right? Like in the United States the market is

260
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,840
Speaker 5:  Amazon, that's the market and Cobos out there like picking up the pieces

261
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,760
Speaker 5:  at Walmart,

262
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,000
Speaker 2:  Right? There's Amazon and then there's the people who do not want Amazon

263
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,200
Speaker 2:  products. That's the only reason you don't buy an Amazon product.

264
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,960
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent. And so everything else in this market right now is

265
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,400
Speaker 5:  very niche in the United States. It's different story in

266
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,040
Speaker 5:  China, e-readers are a lot more common there. They don't care

267
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,880
Speaker 5:  about Amazon. Nobody over there really uses Amazon devices but everybody

268
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,050
Speaker 5:  wants to read. That's why you're seeing all of this like proliferation in

269
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,280
Speaker 5:  China of all these different e-readers is because there's actually a market

270
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,240
Speaker 5:  for it there. And China can also, a lot of those companies

271
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,130
Speaker 5:  can afford to do smaller runs and really kind of figure things

272
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,920
Speaker 5:  out. Whereas we just don't see that in the United States. Nobody wants to

273
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,000
Speaker 5:  experiment at that scale in the US with hardware.

274
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,740
Speaker 2:  I feel like Amazon over time has tried to push in

275
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,560
Speaker 2:  some new like ways of thinking about books. Like they did the

276
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,720
Speaker 2:  Kindle singles thing and there was like a serials thing that they were doing

277
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,290
Speaker 2:  and none of that seems to have taken off. And I think part of me wonders,

278
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,240
Speaker 2:  will devices like this as they get bigger start to change some of the

279
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,720
Speaker 2:  content that people want? Or are we just stuck in a thing where it's like

280
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,400
Speaker 2:  I want books or I want like the internet and if I want the internet I'm gonna

281
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,800
Speaker 2:  go to a different thing. Like they're, they're that middle grounder talking

282
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,280
Speaker 2:  about like the web books and that kind of content just doesn't seem to exist

283
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,680
Speaker 2:  here. And I wonder if it ever will.

284
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,670
Speaker 5:  I think it does exist and and I think people have really found ways

285
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,600
Speaker 5:  around Amazon's World Garden. If you look at the the biggest kind

286
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,200
Speaker 5:  of American web book spaces, they're primarily fan fiction, right? They're,

287
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,080
Speaker 5:  they're primarily WPA and a oh three and both of those have figured

288
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,000
Speaker 5:  out how to put stuff on an Amazon device pretty quickly. And a lot of

289
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Speaker 5:  those readers also are younger and they're just like, I've got a phone, I

290
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,840
Speaker 5:  don't, don't need this. Whereas I wanna be able to read and not worry about

291
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,280
Speaker 5:  my notifications popping up. So I want an e-reader where my notifications

292
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,480
Speaker 5:  are gonna pop up and that's what I give with the books. I can just go and

293
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,400
Speaker 5:  I have no idea if any of you text me if like you hadn't called me, I

294
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,920
Speaker 5:  wouldn't know that I needed to be here for this call today. That's not true.

295
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,720
Speaker 5:  I was working very hard. Like that's what you see a lot of

296
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,120
Speaker 5:  people say No I just want something to focus on writing and reading and doing

297
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,640
Speaker 5:  that. And that's what this crop of products in China is doing. They're just

298
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,120
Speaker 5:  saying we're gonna give the Android experience but a little limited. You're

299
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,840
Speaker 5:  not gonna be answering your emails on this unless you really want to and

300
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,470
Speaker 5:  also wanna cry Fair instead. You wanna read, you wanna take notes. We got

301
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,010
Speaker 5:  you.

302
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,880
Speaker 2:  Okay. So to that point actually the reviews to come on the Kindle

303
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,240
Speaker 2:  scribe, it's supposed to come out before the end of the year. I don't know

304
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,040
Speaker 2:  when, I didn't wanna wait but let's assume this is everything

305
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,400
Speaker 2:  that Amazon claims that it is, which like Kindles have been very good for

306
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,360
Speaker 2:  a very long time. I don't think it's insane to believe Amazon when they say

307
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,560
Speaker 2:  this thing is gonna work pretty well, is this thing gonna light the world

308
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,200
Speaker 2:  on fire? Like does this appeal to Kindle people or is there gonna be like

309
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,120
Speaker 2:  a watershed moment where all of a sudden everybody wants one of these devices?

310
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,240
Speaker 2:  I

311
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,600
Speaker 5:  Think we're closer to that watershed moment with this device because it's

312
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,840
Speaker 5:  got two things going forward. One, it's got a bigger display and people,

313
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,520
Speaker 5:  as much as I hate it, people do love bigger displays. They want, they want

314
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,320
Speaker 5:  a big screen and lip talked about the really loyal

315
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,760
Speaker 5:  DX fans. They're still out there and there's a lot of them and there's a

316
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,600
Speaker 5:  lot of people who are getting older and they wanna blow up the text as big

317
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,480
Speaker 5:  as possible. And I've seen it when they blow up the text as big as possible

318
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,040
Speaker 5:  on that six inch e-reader, it's like four words per page. I

319
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,320
Speaker 2:  Know it's crazy. And

320
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,960
Speaker 5:  So they need at least seven. Yeah and this will give them those seven words.

321
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,800
Speaker 5:  So I think you're gonna see a lot of people embracing it for that reason.

322
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,360
Speaker 5:  And I think the writing is gonna be useful but like

323
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,067
Speaker 5:  I think Amazon has kind of programmed everybody in the United

324
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:42,040
Speaker 5:  States to think that the Waled Garden is the only way to go and

325
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,920
Speaker 5:  so it's gonna be really hard for people to understand that there are other

326
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,710
Speaker 5:  ways to do this. It's not just the Amazon way of living in this Waled

327
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,400
Speaker 5:  garden only having access to Kindle books only having access to your word

328
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,130
Speaker 5:  docs and PDFs in doing annotations on them with this

329
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,480
Speaker 5:  device.

330
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,060
Speaker 2:  No it, I think that's totally right and I think the idea of like a

331
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,040
Speaker 2:  digital handwriting notebook seems like the kind of thing that when we get

332
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,240
Speaker 2:  it right is gonna be massively successful to lots of people and it's gonna

333
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Speaker 2:  be super interesting to see if, if this is the one Yeah,

334
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,230
Speaker 5:  Like if they can figure out the ui, if they can make the UI really interesting

335
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,440
Speaker 5:  and feel snappy because that's one of the problems with the E ink is E Ink

336
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,400
Speaker 5:  that refresh is just slow, slow, slow. Yeah. And even at

337
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,280
Speaker 5:  its fastest, it's still glacial compared to everything else we do.

338
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,680
Speaker 5:  And that's just a huge limitation and they're fixing it, they're improving

339
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,840
Speaker 5:  on it. We're seeing year after year E Ink is getting a lot better at that

340
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,760
Speaker 5:  refresh rate and that's the thing they're very focused on cuz they know that

341
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,400
Speaker 5:  like until the refresh rate gets up to stuff, nobody's gonna adopt this at

342
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,280
Speaker 5:  other things. As long as you see that gross ghosting and the flash as

343
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,080
Speaker 5:  it refreshes the entire page, people are gonna be like, ew, icky. So I think

344
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,960
Speaker 5:  if they can figure out like ways around that refresh problem and we've

345
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,440
Speaker 5:  seen like books has gotten decent at it, remarkable has gotten decent at

346
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,200
Speaker 5:  it, you don't feel that sluggishness necessarily with those products.

347
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,160
Speaker 5:  If Amazon can figure that out, I think it starts to get people excited

348
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,000
Speaker 5:  about it. We'll see what the scribe, I would probably say Hazard like the

349
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,810
Speaker 5:  scribe too. We'll be the big watershed moment rather than the scribe

350
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,320
Speaker 5:  one as much as I want that moment.

351
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,560
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no I I would guess that you're right, but we're gonna, we're gonna

352
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,120
Speaker 2:  come back on here whenever they do ship as one to try out and we'll, we'll

353
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,360
Speaker 2:  talk about

354
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,880
Speaker 5:  It. I'm so excited for that day. Whoever gets to review it, it's gonna be

355
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,840
Speaker 5:  me. I'm gonna fight everybody at the Verge. I can't wait to fight you David.

356
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,280
Speaker 5:  We'll save it for the podcast.

357
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,640
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I I like this plan. All right, we need to take a break and then we're

358
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,000
Speaker 2:  gonna come back and talk about a gadget category. We don't talk about much

359
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,360
Speaker 2:  on this show, just printers, you don't think about them. You probably think

360
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,560
Speaker 2:  your sucks and I tried to figure out why we'll be

361
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:48,620
Speaker 2:  right

362
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,170
Speaker 2:  back. If you run an e-commerce business, you might be laser focused

363
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,970
Speaker 2:  on acquiring new customers, which makes sense at face value until you realize

364
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,650
Speaker 2:  that this isn't necessarily the best business model. According to a Harvard

365
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,290
Speaker 2:  study, acquiring new customers can be anywhere from five to

366
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,450
Speaker 2:  25 times more expensive than retaining existing ones.

367
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,430
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So a couple of months ago we asked you to call the Vergecast

368
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,830
Speaker 2:  hotline and ask us all your Burning Tech questions. You should still do that

369
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:17,670
Speaker 2:  by the way. The number is 8 6 6 Verge one one and we want to

370
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,710
Speaker 2:  hear everything. We've gotten a lot of really great questions, but there's

371
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,140
Speaker 2:  one in particular that I just have not been able to stop

372
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,070
Speaker 2:  thinking about. Here's the message.

373
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,870
Speaker 6:  Hi, this is Jacob. I've got a question that I think a lot of people

374
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,530
Speaker 6:  will resonate with. I have a printer in home that

375
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,210
Speaker 6:  doesn't work and I want to know why don't any

376
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,580
Speaker 6:  printers work and why hasn't a company disrupted the

377
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,150
Speaker 6:  printer market? Thanks, bye.

378
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,750
Speaker 2:  This message just hit me right in the face. Why isn't

379
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,590
Speaker 2:  there any innovation in printers? So for the last few weeks I've been trying

380
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,310
Speaker 2:  to figure that out. The first thing you should know is that

381
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,230
Speaker 2:  the printer market is humongous. If you include everything

382
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,070
Speaker 2:  that is theoretically printing businesses, governments, advertising,

383
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,910
Speaker 2:  3D printing, basically the idea of taking a digital thing and

384
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,590
Speaker 2:  using a device to make it a physical thing. This market is hundreds of billions

385
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,550
Speaker 2:  of dollars a year, But let's narrow it down

386
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,190
Speaker 2:  a bunch and just talk about the printers you might buy or that a small business

387
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,150
Speaker 2:  might use. You know the boxes you buy at Staples and stick in a cupboard

388
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:26,070
Speaker 2:  and use to print concert tickets and Amazon return labels. Four companies

389
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,800
Speaker 2:  make up about 85% of that market according to the research

390
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,710
Speaker 2:  firm idc, HP is the leader, then Epson, then Cannon, then brother.

391
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:37,430
Speaker 2:  The printing market had a big boom during the pandemic with so many people

392
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,990
Speaker 2:  at home dealing with work and school. They just needed to print more stuff.

393
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,940
Speaker 2:  Things have slowed down a bit since then, but the market is

394
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,430
Speaker 2:  still huge. A 2019 estimate said that 62%

395
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:52,050
Speaker 2:  of US households owned a printer and that number has definitely gone up

396
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,670
Speaker 2:  since then. The other thing you should know is that just the basic

397
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,590
Speaker 2:  job of printing is actually really, really hard. Paper

398
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,510
Speaker 2:  is an organic material and no two pages are exactly alike.

399
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,990
Speaker 2:  Feeding that through a fast moving machine, which everybody always wants

400
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,590
Speaker 2:  to be smaller and cheaper and as a result everything gets really hot

401
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,310
Speaker 2:  and really complicated is really hard. I bet your printer still

402
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,670
Speaker 2:  jams. Mine certainly does, but there is plenty of evidence that things

403
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,230
Speaker 2:  are getting better. Still though printers are

404
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,630
Speaker 2:  printers, right? They're super annoying to set up and they throw these

405
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,870
Speaker 2:  unintelligible error messages whenever anything goes wrong. The printing

406
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,750
Speaker 2:  market is the same few companies making the same kinds of devices that they've

407
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,390
Speaker 2:  made for forever. This is what our buddy Jacob really wants to know about.

408
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,350
Speaker 2:  Why is it still like this? So I called up two people with radically different

409
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:43,200
Speaker 2:  views on the printing industry. Diana Soroka, the global head of HP's

410
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,560
Speaker 2:  consumer Printing services, and Cory Doctoral, an author and blogger and

411
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,040
Speaker 2:  a fellow at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Let's start with Diana who

412
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,920
Speaker 2:  I called with a simple question, is there any innovation happening in the

413
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,200
Speaker 2:  printer industry? What cool stuff is going on that we don't know about? She

414
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,120
Speaker 2:  said yes, which of course she would say, and she pointed me not to

415
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,920
Speaker 2:  a specific printer but to an app. It's called HP Smart and

416
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,560
Speaker 2:  it's designed to be the main and much better way that you interact

417
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,760
Speaker 2:  with your printer.

418
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,120
Speaker 7:  There were times in the past where it could take people up to an hour to

419
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,840
Speaker 7:  get their printer up and running and I would say if you look at current technology

420
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,110
Speaker 7:  today, no one has the patience for that. And with our HP

421
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,840
Speaker 7:  Smart app, absolutely new printers today, certainly within 10 minutes you're

422
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,520
Speaker 7:  up and running. So I think some of it is an article, the past experience

423
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,400
Speaker 7:  and if you've taken that long to set up a printer and all you wanna do is

424
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,040
Speaker 7:  see that first page come out with whatever content you wanted on it and you're

425
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,800
Speaker 7:  waiting and and going through different issues with your wifi connection

426
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,920
Speaker 7:  or whatever else, it's so much simpler. Now

427
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,360
Speaker 2:  The smart app is how you set up your printer, but you can also use it to

428
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,320
Speaker 2:  print photos from your phone or see how much ink you have left and

429
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,080
Speaker 2:  even like print a piece of lined paper or a blank Sudoku board you

430
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,280
Speaker 2:  can fill out. I think it makes sense to abstract a lot of this stuff over

431
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,090
Speaker 2:  to your phone. And I do think the idea of printers being

432
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,440
Speaker 2:  more generative is really interesting. Instead of having to find

433
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,320
Speaker 2:  a template online or download an image just to print it,

434
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,130
Speaker 2:  it'd be cool to just say, Print me a lined eight and a half by 11 piece

435
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,960
Speaker 2:  of paper, or I need 10 sheets of paper with blank spaces for

436
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,720
Speaker 2:  answers. Numbered one through 10, Amazon has a service called print with

437
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,320
Speaker 2:  Alexa that is thinking about similar stuff. You can just say, print my shopping

438
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,240
Speaker 2:  list right before you leave to go to the grocery store or print today's Sudoku

439
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,160
Speaker 2:  right when you sit down to do it. It's a good idea and it makes things easier,

440
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,080
Speaker 2:  but I don't know that that counts as like earth shaking innovation. And

441
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,480
Speaker 2:  this is one thing I heard from folks across the printing industry. It's not

442
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,360
Speaker 2:  so much that people want their printer to do fancy crazy new

443
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,320
Speaker 2:  stuff or want a router in their printer or a speaker in their printer. It's

444
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,200
Speaker 2:  that they just want their printer to be easier to use.

445
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,600
Speaker 7:  Yeah, printers doing printer jobs and we wanna make sure, like I said, that

446
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,370
Speaker 7:  that's as easy as possible.

447
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,920
Speaker 2:  One way HP has tried to do this is through a program called Instant Ink,

448
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,280
Speaker 2:  which is a subscription service for ink. You pay a monthly fee depending

449
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,720
Speaker 2:  on how much you print and HP automatically sends you the ink you're gonna

450
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,080
Speaker 2:  need to get it done. Diana said, it's been a huge

451
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,040
Speaker 7:  Hit, we've enough to think about and no one wants to worry about how much

452
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,000
Speaker 7:  ink is left in that cartridge when they all of a sudden realize they have

453
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,560
Speaker 7:  to print. I don't know, their child's book report, which is suddenly 20 pages

454
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,280
Speaker 7:  long and they weren't planning on that and it's 10 o'clock at night and they're

455
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,000
Speaker 7:  like, Oh geez. Now what? I'm gonna run to the store and figure out how to

456
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,040
Speaker 7:  deal with this.

457
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,830
Speaker 2:  This is the moment I knew I needed to call Cory. Doctor Corey is

458
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,700
Speaker 2:  a long, long, long time critic of the printing industry and

459
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,640
Speaker 2:  his argument for why there's no exciting innovation in printers is

460
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,120
Speaker 2:  that basically there's no incentive for printing companies to

461
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,400
Speaker 2:  do anything innovative.

462
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,000
Speaker 8:  I think one of the things that makes people so angry about printers is that

463
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,920
Speaker 8:  we seem to have passed the threshold where buying a good printer

464
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,800
Speaker 8:  means that you have a good printer. Like if you

465
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,000
Speaker 8:  have $16,000 to spend on a ticket from Los Angeles to London, you will get

466
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,720
Speaker 8:  a really comfortable chair and someone who will like actually care about

467
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,320
Speaker 8:  your comfort and they'll serve you a really good meal. And then another really

468
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,720
Speaker 8:  good one, when you get up in the morning and so on, you could spend $16,000

469
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,080
Speaker 8:  on a printer and it would still be garbage.

470
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,840
Speaker 2:  Ultimately though, I would say Corey's not mad that printers jam. I mean

471
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,620
Speaker 2:  he is, but he's especially mad that the industry works the way that

472
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,220
Speaker 2:  it does. And he's particularly mad about the fact that if you

473
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,810
Speaker 2:  wanna buy ink for your printer, it's a lot harder than it

474
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,520
Speaker 2:  should be.

475
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,400
Speaker 8:  We actually do have something new in printers, which is third party ink.

476
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,280
Speaker 8:  Yeah, the printers aren't very durable and they do these things where it's

477
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,960
Speaker 8:  like, Oh, you know, you've printed X thousand pages, therefore we're gonna

478
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,820
Speaker 8:  brick ourselves or whatever. But all of that stuff, including

479
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,410
Speaker 8:  that bricking, all of that stuff can be solved by altering the firmware,

480
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,720
Speaker 8:  the printer so that it accepts third party inks so that it resets its page

481
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,680
Speaker 8:  count to zero and so on. What

482
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,560
Speaker 2:  He's describing is the way a lot of markets work, right? Somebody comes in,

483
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,440
Speaker 2:  builds an accessory or a replacement for a small part of a successful

484
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,400
Speaker 2:  thing and sort of eats them from the inside. Cory gave me the example of

485
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,120
Speaker 2:  Apple, which built keynote and pages in order to copy what

486
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,620
Speaker 2:  was great about PowerPoint and Word and then tried to compete with Windows

487
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,320
Speaker 2:  that way. But in the printer industry like some others, Corey says the law

488
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,920
Speaker 2:  has made that all but impossible. And it starts with the

489
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,480
Speaker 2:  Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.

490
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,160
Speaker 8:  It's a law that says that if there's an access control

491
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,030
Speaker 8:  that restricts access to a copyrighted work like the firmware of

492
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,840
Speaker 8:  a printer, then removing that access control, selling someone a tool to

493
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,120
Speaker 8:  remove that access control as a felony, it's punishable by a five year prison

494
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,600
Speaker 8:  sentence and a $500,000 fine.

495
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,880
Speaker 2:  Basically Corey argues printer companies have spent the time that they might

496
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,080
Speaker 2:  spend innovating and building new products on figuring out how to prevent

497
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,920
Speaker 2:  any other company or developer from doing so. And then once they

498
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,680
Speaker 2:  had all of your printing life all to themselves, they focused on just

499
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,240
Speaker 2:  getting all the possible money out of you. And he argues that

500
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,120
Speaker 2:  things like Instant Inc are nothing more than just a naked money grab.

501
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,040
Speaker 8:  You can see why the street would love it, right? You can see why Wall Street

502
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,620
Speaker 8:  would love it. They've gotten out of the product business except incidentally,

503
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,520
Speaker 8:  in fact, you could even imagine HP exclusively

504
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,380
Speaker 8:  licensing the ability to make HP printers to third

505
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,120
Speaker 8:  parties and Ink and HP would just be in the

506
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,840
Speaker 8:  extracting rent for Ink business.

507
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,680
Speaker 2:  I asked Diana about this criticism by the way, and she said basically that's

508
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,200
Speaker 2:  just not how she sees it. Well

509
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,720
Speaker 7:  The first thing is the business model as it exists today in the market is

510
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,480
Speaker 7:  you buy your own printer. Okay? So you own the printer, you purchased it

511
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,360
Speaker 7:  from wherever your favorite retailer is, and it's yours to print whatever

512
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,640
Speaker 7:  you want. You can enroll an Instant Inc at the time you set it up. You can

513
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,280
Speaker 7:  enroll a month later, two years later whenever you find interest or you find

514
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,640
Speaker 7:  that subscription service of value to you. And while you're on the service,

515
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,520
Speaker 7:  we shift you what we call subscription cartridges. And that's part

516
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,720
Speaker 7:  of the service. It's part of being able to leverage the firmware and the

517
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,760
Speaker 7:  technology and the printer to be able to run the service for you. If at any

518
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,710
Speaker 7:  point in time you cancel, we let you know that at the end of that particular

519
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,530
Speaker 7:  billing cycle that you'll have to return to purchasing what we call

520
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,000
Speaker 7:  traditional cartridges. So it's not about holding your printer cartridge,

521
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,840
Speaker 7:  it's just saying when when you're on the service, you pay for pages

522
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,570
Speaker 7:  and we monitor that and when you're not, you're back to printing in the

523
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,880
Speaker 7:  traditional way. So no, no hostage printers out there.

524
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,600
Speaker 2:  In fact, what she said is that not only do people like this world in which

525
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,400
Speaker 2:  they don't buy or think about their own ink, they feel the same way about

526
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,640
Speaker 2:  printers and paper too. Pretty soon actually, you might start

527
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,600
Speaker 2:  to see subscription printers becoming a thing for a lot of

528
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:24,680
Speaker 2:  users.

529
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,560
Speaker 7:  We actually called it instant platinum, just as a simple branding for

530
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,460
Speaker 7:  the purposes of our test, we pick three printers and we put them out in

531
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,000
Speaker 7:  the market. And basically it's a very simple enrollment flow. You pick your

532
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,560
Speaker 7:  printer, your page plan, you the option to add paper and

533
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,450
Speaker 7:  you get amazing printing taken care of forever. What

534
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,040
Speaker 7:  that means is 24 by seven support your printer breaks. We get you on

535
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,920
Speaker 7:  the next day for one low monthly price. You truly set it, forget

536
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,080
Speaker 7:  it. So now you're not even worried about the printer itself, the printer

537
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,640
Speaker 7:  hardware, anything that could go wrong. And of course you can upgrade that

538
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,120
Speaker 7:  printer along the way. We'll always be messaging you if there's a better

539
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,400
Speaker 7:  printer for you.

540
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,120
Speaker 2:  This debate turns philosophical really quickly and is actually a story about

541
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,080
Speaker 2:  much more than just printers. It's about the fight between openness and

542
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,680
Speaker 2:  innovation on one side, Corey's side and simplicity and convenience. On

543
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,640
Speaker 2:  the other Diana's side, there aren't many times you get to have

544
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,160
Speaker 2:  both and printers definitely don't seem to be one of them. So what do you

545
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,080
Speaker 2:  want A printer that just works that you don't have to think about or the

546
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,040
Speaker 2:  best printer ever made, at least one better than anything you've seen before.

547
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,000
Speaker 2:  I'm increasingly not sure you get to have it both ways, but Corey at least

548
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,880
Speaker 2:  thinks we can.

549
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,680
Speaker 8:  You know, when the DVD players were like five or 10 years old,

550
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,000
Speaker 8:  people just forgot that we used to be able to record tv or if they remembered

551
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,360
Speaker 8:  it, they were like, there must be something intrinsic to the DVD player that

552
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,040
Speaker 8:  makes it hard. It was just a design choice, right? Like people have forgotten

553
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,000
Speaker 8:  that you can have federated social media or interoperable app

554
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,120
Speaker 8:  stores or any of these other things. They just like, they just don't remember

555
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,320
Speaker 8:  that it's a possibility and you have to make people know what's missing.

556
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,720
Speaker 8:  You have to remind them what they're missing before you can get the political

557
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,480
Speaker 8:  will to get people to have it. And you know, I think the printer companies

558
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,040
Speaker 8:  would like us to just forget that printers ever worked and that weren't

559
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:20,530
Speaker 8:  a

560
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,360
Speaker 8:  rip off.

561
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,080
Speaker 2:  Oh, before we go, here's another voicemail we got about

562
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,690
Speaker 2:  printers.

563
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,680
Speaker 10:  Hey Vergecast, my name is Nick, I'm from Colorado. I'm calling to ask

564
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,570
Speaker 10:  a question about wireless printers. My wife and I have

565
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:37,520
Speaker 10:  a HP NV 5,000 series that's on the fritz and I need to

566
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,970
Speaker 10:  replace it with something that's maybe a little bit more efficient on

567
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,960
Speaker 10:  ink. Just figured wireless printer can be a fun niche topic

568
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,080
Speaker 10:  to talk about. Thanks for your help.

569
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,480
Speaker 2:  I don't have a perfect answer for this one except that I have a brother laser

570
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,200
Speaker 2:  printer and it serves me pretty well and I hardly ever have to think about

571
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,750
Speaker 2:  it and that's basically the goal. But in the course of researching this episode,

572
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,600
Speaker 2:  I spent a lot of time asking around and researching to figure out

573
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,360
Speaker 2:  what you should look for in an everyday printer. And I did find some

574
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,300
Speaker 2:  pretty straightforward tips for getting it right. Here's

575
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,920
Speaker 2:  three, One, buy a laser jet printer. Especially if all you need to do is

576
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,880
Speaker 2:  print simple things like return labels and word documents. They're often

577
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,640
Speaker 2:  a little more expensive upfront but much cheaper and easier to maintain over

578
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,000
Speaker 2:  time. And if you only print every now and then like I do, the toner in a

579
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,920
Speaker 2:  laser jet printer lasts much longer than the ink in an ink jet buying

580
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,640
Speaker 2:  device. Number two, go black and white if you can since that'll be even cheaper

581
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,920
Speaker 2:  to maintain. Here's what Consumer Reports said in a really great buying guide

582
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,360
Speaker 2:  that I'll link to in the show notes. It says, Our research shows that people

583
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,280
Speaker 2:  print lots and lots of texts in black and white, rarely print graphics and

584
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,120
Speaker 2:  almost never print photos. And that's where monochrome laser printers excel.

585
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,640
Speaker 2:  They print crisp text and they print it fast. And economically, our survey

586
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,800
Speaker 2:  data says they're generally more reliable than inkjets in the long term,

587
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Speaker 2:  which is why many of the survey respondents who bought laser printers really

588
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,490
Speaker 2:  love them. It's good advice, I totally agree with it. Buying advice

589
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,880
Speaker 2:  number three, if you print photos but only a few times a year, don't buy

590
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,400
Speaker 2:  a fancy printer just like save the address for the nearest

591
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,800
Speaker 2:  Michaels or Kinkos and spend a few bucks when you need to instead of a lot

592
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,760
Speaker 2:  of money for a thing you'll rarely use. If you do print a lot though,

593
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,800
Speaker 2:  there are some great photo printers out there and you should shop based on

594
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,680
Speaker 2:  the cost per page as much as the actual cost of the printer. That number,

595
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,340
Speaker 2:  the cost per page will be what really determines how much you spend

596
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,040
Speaker 2:  on printing. And quick bonus buying advice. Number four, the all

597
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,680
Speaker 2:  in ones are actually really good now, not that long ago, I remember someone

598
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,440
Speaker 2:  telling me that the best printers were always the dedicated ones and that

599
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,680
Speaker 2:  adding more features made the printing worse. By all accounts, that's not

600
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,400
Speaker 2:  the case anymore. You can get a scanner printer, even a fax

601
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,320
Speaker 2:  machine if that's how you roll. And it can do all of those things pretty

602
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,080
Speaker 2:  well. Printers maybe kind of suck still, but they're

603
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,630
Speaker 2:  also

604
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,440
Speaker 2:  pretty good. Okay, we need to take a break and then we're gonna come back

605
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,000
Speaker 2:  and we're gonna test some new earbuds, including the latest AirPods Pro.

606
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,160
Speaker 2:  We'll

607
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:04,030
Speaker 2:  be

608
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:04,690
Speaker 2:  right back.

609
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,940
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. It's time for, if I'm honest, my favorite segment on

610
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,480
Speaker 2:  the Vergecast, our earbud voice call tests. I know there's like a few of

611
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,360
Speaker 2:  you out there who absolutely hate this segment and for those of you, please

612
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,920
Speaker 2:  know this is probably the last one of these we'll do for a little while,

613
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,760
Speaker 2:  but also I love it. So I'm just sorry. In past episodes of this show,

614
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,600
Speaker 2:  we've had Verge reviewer Chris Welch take wireless earbuds on wild

615
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,200
Speaker 2:  stress tests so we can hear how well their microphones work because

616
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,880
Speaker 2:  microphones matter, they matter for voice calls and zoom obviously.

617
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,600
Speaker 2:  But increasingly also for Siri and voice dictation and more and more

618
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,260
Speaker 2:  of our day to day phone interactions. We took Chris to a busy

619
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,200
Speaker 2:  coffee shop and we put him on a ferry and we stress tested the heck out

620
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,800
Speaker 2:  of everything we could find. So far the two sets of earbuds to make it out

621
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,760
Speaker 2:  of our tests and into our future tests have been

622
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,200
Speaker 2:  Apple's AirPods Pro and Google's Pixel Buds Pro. But now it's tech review

623
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,760
Speaker 2:  season and more new earbuds have hit the market. Most recently we have the

624
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,520
Speaker 2:  Bose quiet Comfort earbuds too and a new second generation update

625
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,200
Speaker 2:  to the AirPods Pro. So we had to put those to the test. Chris Welch wasn't

626
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,760
Speaker 2:  able to join us this time because again, it's tech review season. So this

627
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,600
Speaker 2:  time we had senior video producer Becca Versace take the new

628
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,200
Speaker 2:  earbuds and our pass winners on a bike ride in Brooklyn. The question was,

629
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,320
Speaker 2:  are wireless earbuds good enough to take some calls from your bicycle commute?

630
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,720
Speaker 2:  We were testing wind, we were testing park noises, we were testing all kinds

631
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,490
Speaker 2:  of stuff. And Becca, who has spent a lot of time with these earbuds for her

632
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,080
Speaker 2:  video reviews is gonna help us find out Becca.

633
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,120
Speaker 2:  Hello. Hi, where are you? What is happening here? Yes,

634
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,080
Speaker 14:  I am in Prospect Park, better known as Brooklyn's Backyard. We're

635
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,480
Speaker 14:  gonna be doing some

636
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,320
Speaker 2:  Loops. We are. So the shtick here is we always try to put these in like deeply

637
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,810
Speaker 2:  unpleasant places that are horrible for everyone to listen to, which is precisely

638
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,840
Speaker 2:  the point. So we're gonna try to fix this, but let's just set everybody up

639
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,720
Speaker 2:  here. You have a helmet on which is good, good and safe of course. And if,

640
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,920
Speaker 2:  if I'm looking at this correctly, we're on video right now so I can see your

641
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,720
Speaker 2:  face and it looks like I'm inside of your bag. Is that, is that correct?

642
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,800
Speaker 2:  I just wanna give people the vibe of what's happening here. Close.

643
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,680
Speaker 14:  So I have a very cheap phone mount that I use

644
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,440
Speaker 14:  on my bike. So you are inside the phone mount.

645
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,450
Speaker 2:  And what headphones are we listening to right now? Just to, just to start

646
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,180
Speaker 2:  things off.

647
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,160
Speaker 14:  So these are like $20 wired Apple

648
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,920
Speaker 14:  headphones, except they are so old that they have the eighth inch jack

649
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,760
Speaker 14:  on them and I'm using them with my S 10, which still has a headphones jack

650
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,280
Speaker 14:  and is so hard to let go of because of that

651
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,040
Speaker 2:  I support this. But in theory, this is the best sounding thing we're

652
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,760
Speaker 2:  gonna hear, right? It's all downhill from here. You're not moving yet, you're

653
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,820
Speaker 2:  on wired earbuds like this should be the best we get, right?

654
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,400
Speaker 14:  That's correct, yes. And now there's someone backing up so that should maybe

655
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,360
Speaker 14:  not help so much, but correct.

656
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,480
Speaker 2:  Hey, this is the world, this is what we're here for.

657
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,870
Speaker 14:  All right, we're getting outta here. We're on the road.

658
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,720
Speaker 14:  Okay. Oh, excuse me.

659
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,320
Speaker 2:  All right, well then stop when it's safe and you're not gonna die. Switch

660
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,080
Speaker 2:  headphones. Let's do, we have four to test today. So let's start with the

661
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,920
Speaker 2:  one that won our last test. Let's do the Pixel Buds Pro from Google.

662
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,180
Speaker 2:  Let's try those first. You

663
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,000
Speaker 14:  Got it. All right, David, these are the pixel buds pro.

664
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,940
Speaker 14:  I love them because Pixel Buds, the o O G with

665
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,800
Speaker 14:  the cords had swipe up and down volume controls and

666
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,240
Speaker 14:  these also have that and I just love that legacy.

667
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,360
Speaker 2:  It is a nice thing.

668
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,120
Speaker 14:  These headphones are $200. They have pretty solid anc. If you have

669
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,440
Speaker 14:  an Android phone, you know you have that quick pairing option, which is

670
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,760
Speaker 14:  great. Pretty much standard at this point. And they sound pretty good. All

671
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:18,960
Speaker 14:  right,

672
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,640
Speaker 2:  Well let's go for a ride. Let's hear how we do.

673
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,720
Speaker 14:  All right, here we go. We're gonna chase this N

674
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,520
Speaker 14:  YP D car. All right, so we're taking

675
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,720
Speaker 14:  out some good here. The N car is

676
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,640
Speaker 14:  on three wheels. The, it's a beautiful day in

677
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,360
Speaker 14:  Brooklyn. What do you got from me David?

678
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,300
Speaker 2:  You sound like you're riding a bike in pretty heavy wind. I can

679
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,120
Speaker 2:  hear you, but it's pretty quiet. Like it's, it's very clear Google is like

680
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,160
Speaker 2:  working really, really, really, really hard to kick the noise outta your

681
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,520
Speaker 2:  headphones. I'm not getting much background noise at all, but I'm also not

682
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,000
Speaker 2:  getting much of you.

683
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,480
Speaker 14:  Okay. There isn't much background noise except for the wind. But even

684
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,280
Speaker 14:  I can hear all the wind at these buds are taken up.

685
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,400
Speaker 2:  Try slowing down a little. Just give me like a, like a nice gentle coast

686
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,910
Speaker 2:  and see if it like, I want to kind of know where the wind

687
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,840
Speaker 2:  goes from manageable to, not really manageable cause this is pretty rough.

688
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,040
Speaker 2:  Okay,

689
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,980
Speaker 14:  So this is at like a nice Sunday cruising speed. Okay. You know,

690
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,890
Speaker 14:  I'm just too along. There's a horse, there's

691
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:19,880
Speaker 14:  two horses, there's all these children screaming. Can you hear

692
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,600
Speaker 14:  them at all?

693
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,040
Speaker 2:  Hardly at all. Actually, this is actually pretty manageable. You're still,

694
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,440
Speaker 2:  it's clearly like compressing your voice just right down to the middle. So

695
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,400
Speaker 2:  I'm not getting like much of anything interesting around you. But I, I

696
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,240
Speaker 2:  can at least like hear you pretty clearly as you ride like that.

697
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,120
Speaker 14:  Oh hell yeah. I would say this breeze is like a very light breeze

698
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,200
Speaker 14:  on a summer day. Yeah, you're not in a windstorm, but it's also

699
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,050
Speaker 14:  not no breeze. And I hear it a lot less. I got a car

700
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,850
Speaker 14:  coming up on my right right now and I

701
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:52,320
Speaker 14:  see parks. Oh, you could grab the back of that bed and coast.

702
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,360
Speaker 2:  Okay, so a thing I just noticed that you, you just confirmed a theory that

703
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,520
Speaker 2:  I had, which is that what it sounds like is happening is when these buds

704
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,600
Speaker 2:  only have to cancel the wind. They do a pretty good job because when it was

705
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,240
Speaker 2:  in that quiet phase, I could hear you really well, but then it's like as

706
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,760
Speaker 2:  soon as another thing comes up and it has to do two things at once, it starts

707
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,960
Speaker 2:  to kind of fall apart. Like you got way worse when the car showed up, even

708
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,080
Speaker 2:  though I couldn't hear the car. And then it got better as soon as it was

709
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:14,400
Speaker 2:  gone.

710
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,880
Speaker 14:  So what's worse? Like canceling out the noise and also making

711
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,640
Speaker 14:  my voice funny or just letting the noise be because I

712
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,280
Speaker 14:  am outside and those sounds happen.

713
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,600
Speaker 2:  This is such a good question. I feel like the the right answer is somewhere

714
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,440
Speaker 2:  in the middle, but to me it's like I would rather

715
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,920
Speaker 2:  hear nothing than hear everything. Just personal opinion, like listening

716
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,800
Speaker 2:  to someone who appears to like be inside of a

717
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,360
Speaker 2:  concert, talking to you on a phone is just a nightmare. And so I'd rather

718
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,960
Speaker 2:  just be like, I can't hear anything. Call me later than just be like overcome

719
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,040
Speaker 2:  by all the insane noise of your life.

720
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,000
Speaker 14:  Wow, okay. Interesting. Cause I have the opposite opinion. Often I'm on

721
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,680
Speaker 14:  the phone with my parents and they're like, You do sound bad. What? What's

722
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,400
Speaker 14:  going on? You know, it's like that sort of like level of concern and I just

723
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,030
Speaker 14:  have to be like, no, it's just a, a car going by. And if they could

724
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:03,680
Speaker 14:  hear that then they wouldn't worry that I'm, you know,

725
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,080
Speaker 14:  dying

726
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,020
Speaker 2:  Fair. But then the flip side of that is every time a car goes by it's gonna

727
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,600
Speaker 2:  sound like the your, your building exploded.

728
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,240
Speaker 14:  This is true.

729
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,400
Speaker 2:  All right, I think we're good on this one. Go ahead and pull over and let's

730
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,280
Speaker 2:  switch to the next one. Let's do the Bose headphones next.

731
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,760
Speaker 14:  Oh, you got it. Ready to connect. These are the

732
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,680
Speaker 14:  Bose quiet comfort earbuds too. And I often refer to them as

733
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,760
Speaker 14:  the QC twos.

734
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,000
Speaker 2:  Okay. So the thing with these before we test the real thing is the noise

735
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,880
Speaker 2:  cancellation on these, according to Chris Wild who reviewed them is like

736
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,480
Speaker 2:  unbelievable. Has that been your experience too? Is it

737
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,640
Speaker 2:  incredible, David?

738
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,620
Speaker 14:  Unbelievable. You want main character energy in your life. Get a pair

739
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:45,580
Speaker 14:  of these, put on some, I don't know, song from

740
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,440
Speaker 14:  your teens and walk down fifth Avenue in Manhattan.

741
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,800
Speaker 14:  You are the main character. A hundred percent.

742
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,680
Speaker 2:  That is all I've ever wanted. It's the dream. Let's go for a bike

743
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:55,800
Speaker 2:  ride.

744
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,520
Speaker 14:  All right, we are on the road. It's a bit breezy over on the side of the

745
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,400
Speaker 14:  park right now. Oh, interesting. So the bows are, I'm

746
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,600
Speaker 14:  hearing the breeze and as soon as I start to hear it, the bows are canceling

747
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,520
Speaker 14:  it out for me. We've seen this feature from a few buds, but I didn't know

748
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,240
Speaker 14:  that these ones had that, so that's cool.

749
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,040
Speaker 2:  I'm getting some interesting stuff from you here. Like on the one hand, it's

750
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,880
Speaker 2:  basically doing the thing where it is, it just compressed your voice to like

751
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,600
Speaker 2:  one teeny tiny frequency. So you sound like you're coming through a phone

752
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,880
Speaker 2:  call basically, which is fine. I can hear you fine. It just, it's just super,

753
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,840
Speaker 2:  super, super compressed. But I'm getting more

754
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,320
Speaker 2:  wind noise and I guess it's wind noise than I expected. It sounds like

755
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,960
Speaker 2:  someone is sucking something through a straw is the only

756
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,150
Speaker 2:  way I can describe it. And it's very odd.

757
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:43,560
Speaker 14:  Is there a lot of water in the cup or is there no water in the cup? Are

758
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,400
Speaker 14:  we like

759
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,560
Speaker 2:  Slurping? No, it's like right at the end of the cup when there's like a little

760
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,280
Speaker 2:  bit of water, but mostly you're getting, it's like the last bit of

761
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,080
Speaker 2:  the milkshake straw bit. It's not great. I don't love it. I would

762
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,950
Speaker 2:  say you sound worse, but I can hear you better. And you're going

763
00:47:58,950 --> 00:47:59,360
Speaker 2:  pretty fast.

764
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,240
Speaker 14:  I am going faster than I was at the end of the pixel buds. And I will

765
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,960
Speaker 14:  say these buds stick out the most from the sides of my ears. Like

766
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,740
Speaker 14:  they're pretty chunky on the outside, which I used to dock

767
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,720
Speaker 14:  buds for, but I don't know if you have that great of anc. I can

768
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,560
Speaker 14:  have some chalkiness.

769
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,080
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's understandable.

770
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,000
Speaker 14:  All right. Should I pull over and switch?

771
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think so. Let's do the first Gen AirPods real quick. We'll just

772
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,480
Speaker 2:  do those quickly and then switch to the new ones. Okay,

773
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,910
Speaker 14:  You got it. These are the first

774
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:33,880
Speaker 14:  Gen AirPod pros, so they should have a pretty good mic

775
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,000
Speaker 14:  quality.

776
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,280
Speaker 2:  Yeah, the thing I've liked about the AirPods in our past tests is that it's

777
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,040
Speaker 2:  a pretty good middle ground of like, it does pretty good noise

778
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,480
Speaker 2:  cancellation and pretty good mic. It's not the best at either one, but it's

779
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,680
Speaker 2:  like good enough at both that it tends to work for most people. And the thing

780
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,400
Speaker 2:  is, for me at least, the transparency is the reason the AirPods are great.

781
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,520
Speaker 2:  Yes. It's like leaps and bounds better than anybody else's.

782
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,560
Speaker 14:  Yeah, it really does feel like there's nothing in your ears at all, which

783
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,480
Speaker 14:  is what I love about the Sony Link buds as well, cuz they're, you know,

784
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,610
Speaker 14:  quite literally have holes in them. But you know, the danger is, I have

785
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:06,320
Speaker 14:  a feeling in 10 years, like your doctors are just

786
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,120
Speaker 14:  gonna be banking. Like if you're looking for a career right now,

787
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,920
Speaker 14:  go learn about the ears because we're all gonna have gunked up,

788
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,920
Speaker 14:  funked up ears.

789
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,800
Speaker 2:  Yeah. We're all just gonna be deaf in a decade too. Like all right,

790
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,040
Speaker 2:  let's, let's go for a ride. I'm already hearing more background noise than

791
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,170
Speaker 2:  either of the other two, which is interesting.

792
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:28,160
Speaker 14:  All right, so you're on the road. It's a bit breezy. We got that cross

793
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,880
Speaker 14:  breeze again. I'm not going too fast yet, but there's pretty

794
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,560
Speaker 14:  good headwind coming along.

795
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,840
Speaker 2:  Okay. You sound pretty good so far. Okay. I mean one of the things I'm realizing

796
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,800
Speaker 2:  here is that like the main thing a lot of these companies are doing

797
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,920
Speaker 2:  is trying to cancel wind noise. So it's not super shocking that they're all

798
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,880
Speaker 2:  pretty good at canceling wind noise, but the fact that they're able to do

799
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,720
Speaker 2:  a lot of wind noise and some other stuff, that's where it kind of seems

800
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,400
Speaker 2:  to vary, which is interesting.

801
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,490
Speaker 14:  I'm going down a bit of a hill here, so we're gonna take on a little bit

802
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:59,360
Speaker 14:  more wind to good baseball fields. I'm crossing where

803
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,000
Speaker 14:  the Nighthawk Cinema is the exit for that and the city bike

804
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,550
Speaker 14:  rack that never has city bikes because it's at the top of the

805
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,800
Speaker 14:  hill and well, you take the bike down, not a,

806
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,560
Speaker 14:  that's for sure. Yeah. How's that?

807
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,240
Speaker 2:  It's gotten substantially worse. Okay, I can still hear you.

808
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,720
Speaker 2:  Okay, but we're, we're sort of veering towards the pixel buds thing where

809
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,600
Speaker 2:  its answer is just to make you very compressed and very quiet.

810
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,960
Speaker 14:  Ah ooh. Yikes. Yeah, turn off that volume.

811
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,120
Speaker 2:  The good news is none of these are like, like absolutely failing the tests

812
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,880
Speaker 2:  so far, which is nice. Unlike the, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro from the last

813
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,080
Speaker 2:  time, which absolutely failed our test. This is all like varying degrees

814
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,280
Speaker 2:  of like, it kind of works so far.

815
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,080
Speaker 14:  All right, so I'm about to hit a big, Oh there's a guy playing a saxophone.

816
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,760
Speaker 14:  Can you hear the guy playing the saxophone? He's playing one single note.

817
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,630
Speaker 2:  All I hear I was gonna say, all I hear is one single note, it just

818
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,560
Speaker 2:  sounded like just one two of the saxophone.

819
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,440
Speaker 14:  It was one he must be, you know, just warming up that read. Is that

820
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,210
Speaker 14:  what, So we're about to hit a big hill. We're about also about to cut

821
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:03,640
Speaker 14:  some horses. Do you want me to bomb down the hill or do you want me to change?

822
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,520
Speaker 2:  Let's switch before you do the big hill. Cause I think we're gonna, we're

823
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,210
Speaker 2:  gonna put the AirPods Pro two through the hardest test of

824
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,080
Speaker 2:  them all, so let's see how it does.

825
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,960
Speaker 14:  All right, cool. These are the AirPods

826
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,960
Speaker 14:  Pro second gen.

827
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,440
Speaker 2:  So these are the new ones which are ostensibly basically like slightly better

828
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,830
Speaker 2:  at everything without being like a gigantic earth shattering new

829
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,080
Speaker 2:  thing, right? That's

830
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,930
Speaker 14:  Correct. A lot of folks seem to think they are earth shattering and I think

831
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:32,440
Speaker 14:  that's because if you've had a pair of AirPod pros and you use them regularly

832
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,040
Speaker 14:  for more than like a year and a half, they start to like dump

833
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,040
Speaker 14:  in every way possible. And so when you do get a new pair, you're gonna be

834
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,920
Speaker 14:  like, Oh my God, this is the greatest thing ever. But if you are

835
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,600
Speaker 14:  looking at them in terms of like the full market of earbuds and

836
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,840
Speaker 14:  outside of ecosystem, they're good. Okay. If you shout out to the video,

837
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,480
Speaker 14:  go watch it. We did like a cool ANC test and Owen Grove

838
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,320
Speaker 14:  and Jasmine Lewis, my two directors with me, like we just put our heart

839
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,120
Speaker 14:  and soul into that one. So go check it out if you

840
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,160
Speaker 2:  Haven't, it's a good one. Yeah, we'll put that link in the show notes. It's,

841
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,680
Speaker 2:  it's a good video. Thanks bud. All right, so we have a big, big downhill

842
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,400
Speaker 2:  to do here. So we're gonna put these two the probably the

843
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,920
Speaker 2:  hardest test of anything we've tried so far. Let's see how we do.

844
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,690
Speaker 14:  Yeah, if you ever see me in Proso car going down this hill, even when I'm

845
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:18,600
Speaker 14:  not testing my quality, I'm screaming. So this is nothing new.

846
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,520
Speaker 14:  First we're starting out next to some horses and here we

847
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,040
Speaker 14:  go. Yep. Hello. Good friends. Have a great walk.

848
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,000
Speaker 2:  Oh, I heard a lot of horses that time. More horses than usual on that one.

849
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,960
Speaker 14:  I got a little close, I was a little excited you talking to

850
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,170
Speaker 14:  me. I love, I love a good,

851
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:47,910
Speaker 14:  you

852
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:48,520
Speaker 14:  know, we,

853
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,480
Speaker 2:  This is what I was hoping for. We successfully broke the

854
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:52,680
Speaker 2:  test.

855
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,080
Speaker 14:  Okay. Could you hear any of that on towards the bottom

856
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,960
Speaker 2:  There? Barely. It's one of those things like, you know when you can hear

857
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,440
Speaker 2:  through the wall that somebody is talking but you can't hear any of the stuff

858
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,600
Speaker 2:  that they're saying. That's essentially what I'm getting you right, right

859
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,360
Speaker 2:  now I can like, I can tell you're talking, I just don't know what

860
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,280
Speaker 2:  you're talking about.

861
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,120
Speaker 14:  Give us through the wall blue. Okay. We are at the bottom of

862
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,040
Speaker 14:  the hill. It's still relatively windy. I will slow down now though and

863
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,480
Speaker 14:  we'll, we'll do a little bit less headwind.

864
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,520
Speaker 2:  Yeah, give, get us back to the, the Sunday stroll pace and we'll see how

865
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,160
Speaker 2:  we do.

866
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,280
Speaker 14:  Yeah, so we we're strolling. I have to imagine this sounds pretty good.

867
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,080
Speaker 14:  There's like a small breeze again, it's like a fall day breeze. There's

868
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,480
Speaker 14:  not too much outside noise. There's some traffic, but it's not moving quickly.

869
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,240
Speaker 2:  The thing that is amazing me about this is how similar all four

870
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,040
Speaker 2:  of these have been performance wise. Yeah. Like the distinct vibe that I'm

871
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,880
Speaker 2:  getting here is basically like avoid going very

872
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,800
Speaker 2:  fast if you can while talking to people, but like it works in

873
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,640
Speaker 2:  a pinch. This is the kind of thing like I think if you, if you are like riding

874
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,200
Speaker 2:  your bike and need to ask Syria a question, like

875
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,960
Speaker 2:  it would probably work,

876
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,600
Speaker 14:  You know, what I do find though is like a total disaster is

877
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,440
Speaker 14:  speech to text. I think it's usually not great, but whenever there's

878
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,080
Speaker 14:  the least bit of outside noise Wow. Does it tank?

879
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,920
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that is fair. Almost any pair of headphones, even in good conditions,

880
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,320
Speaker 2:  speech to text seems to get like substantially worse for me. And I've never

881
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,440
Speaker 2:  totally understood why that is.

882
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,220
Speaker 14:  I mean all of these earbuds, right, they're all using Bluetooth of, of

883
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,560
Speaker 14:  some sort. Yep. And so there is a point where it's like it can only get

884
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,440
Speaker 14:  so good on that standard, which is why, you know, we had those rumors about

885
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,440
Speaker 14:  Apple like creating their own standard, which I was about to be so mad if

886
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,280
Speaker 14:  that was true. So it's not true yet, but maybe in

887
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,640
Speaker 14:  three years when they put out another generation of the haircut pros.

888
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,770
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's even Apple has basically said like, we have maxed out the limits

889
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:45,200
Speaker 2:  of Bluetooth. If you want it to get better, we're gonna have to figure out

890
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,640
Speaker 2:  something else. So it's gonna be interesting to see. All right, Becca, thank

891
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,690
Speaker 2:  you for bringing us on your bike ride today. We've, we've been through a

892
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,640
Speaker 2:  lot together, so I'm gonna let you go. This test was super helpful. I learned

893
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,920
Speaker 2:  a lot, I'm surprised I heard you as much as I did and we will definitely

894
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,720
Speaker 2:  be sure to check in with you next time. Another earbuds are released it to

895
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,720
Speaker 2:  the world.

896
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,450
Speaker 14:  Super. I'll talk to you all soon.

897
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:09,810
Speaker 2:  One overall takeaway here, which I know we say every time is that actually

898
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:13,730
Speaker 2:  most of these are pretty good. Now, as long as you're in a good spot, if

899
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:17,610
Speaker 2:  you're at home or in a Quietish office, you'll probably have good luck

900
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:21,450
Speaker 2:  with all of these high end models. But as you heard, things get messy

901
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:25,330
Speaker 2:  when the world gets louder. I think I probably wouldn't recommend long phone

902
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:29,090
Speaker 2:  calls from the middle of a bike race on any of these headphones, but you

903
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,670
Speaker 2:  gotta do what you gotta do sometimes. Just talk loud, I

904
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:36,530
Speaker 2:  guess. Oh, and here's a really crucial piece of info Becca's bike

905
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:40,490
Speaker 2:  ride ended up at the Prospect Park Zoo. So we got one last very

906
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:44,130
Speaker 2:  important test in here's how the AirPods Pro two would handle a phone call

907
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:46,850
Speaker 2:  if you were hanging out with a bunch of sea lions.

908
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:50,610
Speaker 14:  I hope this podcast,

909
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,930
Speaker 2:  Whoa, whoa, was that,

910
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,890
Speaker 14:  Wouldn't you like the low? Hold on,

911
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:58,600
Speaker 14:  they'll be

912
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,500
Speaker 14:  back.

913
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,090
Speaker 2:  Wow. Okay, so if, if we've learned one thing so far, it's that

914
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,570
Speaker 2:  nobody prepared for sea lions.

915
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:09,530
Speaker 14:  Nobody has prepared for this. This is the, oh my

916
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:09,690
Speaker 14:  God.

917
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,610
