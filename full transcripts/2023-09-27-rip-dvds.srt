00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,600
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the LaserDisc

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,360
Speaker 2:  Resurgence. I'm your friend David Pierce and I am at a Redbox

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,480
Speaker 2:  kiosk near my house outside of A C V ss. I confess, I have never

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,480
Speaker 2:  done this before. I've been watching DVDs since, like I

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
Speaker 2:  had one of those DVD V C R combo things and

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,600
Speaker 2:  back then the only DVD we had was clueless. So I watched it like

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,520
Speaker 2:  65,000 times. Then my family was a pretty early Netflix

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,640
Speaker 2:  house So. we had those red envelopes coming and going all the time. And then

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,200
Speaker 2:  somewhere along the way I gave away my DVD collection and just went all in

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,160
Speaker 2:  on streaming. There was a piracy phase in there too, but we don't

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,120
Speaker 2:  have to talk about that. But now here I am at the Redbox because this kind

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,080
Speaker 2:  of feels like the last bastion of the old DVD era.

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,960
Speaker 2:  Like I'm looking at this and I can get DVDs of Asteroid City and the Super

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,880
Speaker 2:  Mario Brothers movie and Shazam, which I definitely won't do,

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,920
Speaker 2:  and Cocaine Bear, which I might do. And this just feels

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,560
Speaker 2:  like an era. That's ending DVD dot com, which is the name of

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,280
Speaker 2:  Netflix's old DVD delivery service, is shutting down for good this week.

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,200
Speaker 2:  Oh, and quick p s A on that front, actually, if you're still a DVD subscriber,

20
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,080
Speaker 2:  put all your favorite movies at the top of the queue right now because you

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,160
Speaker 2:  get to keep everything you have when the service goes down. So do that as

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,080
Speaker 2:  fast as you can. But with that gone and streaming still really ascendant

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Speaker 2:  even though it's kind of a mess right now. I just wonder what's gonna happen.

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,160
Speaker 2:  Is physical media just dead? Is it gonna have a huge comeback like vinyl

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,720
Speaker 2:  did where everybody's suddenly buying albums Again, I really don't know,

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,800
Speaker 2:  but I'm very curious about it. So in the first part of the show today, I

27
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,120
Speaker 2:  am actually going to talk to the person responsible for this kiosk I'm standing

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,960
Speaker 2:  in front of. That's Bill Rouhana, the C e O of Chicken Soup for the Soul

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,920
Speaker 2:  Entertainment, which now owns Redbox as of a year ago. He has, it turns

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,720
Speaker 2:  out some surprisingly strong thoughts on the subject. After that, we're gonna

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,480
Speaker 2:  switch gears a bit and talk about metrics. The numbers we see everywhere

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,280
Speaker 2:  online, especially around video views and what it means that

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,880
Speaker 2:  everyone reports those numbers and none of it really seems to have anything

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,520
Speaker 2:  to do with anything. All that is coming in just a sec. But first I gotta

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,080
Speaker 2:  pick a movie here, right? We've got a bunch of Spidermans,

36
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,520
Speaker 2:  John Wick three plane, which I don't think I

37
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,000
Speaker 2:  knew was a movie until right this second. Oh, they have Dungeons and Dragons.

38
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,880
Speaker 2:  Okay, Dungeons and Dragons Honor Among Thieves. Rent DVD $2

39
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,840
Speaker 2:  and 25 cents. Or I can buy it for 3 99. I'm buying a DVD. Let's do

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,680
Speaker 2:  this. Alright, taking this home. Here we go. This is The Vergecast.

41
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,360
Speaker 2:  See you in a sec.

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,710
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Alright, I got a movie, I made it home and then

43
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,870
Speaker 2:  I realized I don't own a DVD player anymore, which was problem for a second.

44
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,950
Speaker 2:  But then I realized that's why game consoles exist. Someday I

45
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,830
Speaker 2:  will own one of those little small disc list ones, but for now I have

46
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,670
Speaker 2:  an old Xbox One and a PS four, both of which have disc drives. So

47
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,710
Speaker 2:  I am wired up and ready for movie time. But for now, let's talk about

48
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,310
Speaker 2:  the future of those discs. Redbox is probably the biggest

49
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,430
Speaker 2:  brand left in physical movies. DVD dot com obviously

50
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,270
Speaker 2:  dying this week. Blockbuster is long gone. I don't think anybody goes to

51
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,150
Speaker 2:  Best Buy or Walmart to buy movies anymore, right? And

52
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,190
Speaker 2:  Redbox just kind of seems like the last game in town. And Redbox

53
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,310
Speaker 2:  actually got a new owner last year. It's called Chicken Soup for the Soul

54
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,990
Speaker 2:  Entertainment, which also owns the streaming service, crackle and

55
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,830
Speaker 2:  popcorn flicks. Plus it has film production and distribution companies.

56
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,070
Speaker 2:  The company paid $375 million for Redbox last

57
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,990
Speaker 2:  year, which a lot of people thought was totally bonkers at

58
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,750
Speaker 2:  the time and still do, frankly. But Bill Rouhana, the c e o of chicken

59
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,670
Speaker 2:  Soup for the Soul Entertainment is convinced that physical media is

60
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,550
Speaker 2:  not dead, or at least is not dead yet and won't be dead anytime

61
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,270
Speaker 2:  soon. So I called him up to talk about why he thinks this is a good

62
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,390
Speaker 2:  business and why he's betting on discs, even when his own company is in the

63
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,190
Speaker 2:  streaming business. And maybe most of all why he tried to buy

64
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,110
Speaker 2:  DVD dot com from Netflix before it shut down. One thing you should know before

65
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,030
Speaker 2:  we get into the interview, bill uses the terms a v O D and s o d a

66
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,790
Speaker 2:  bunch, and a o d means ad supported video on demand. And ss

67
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,830
Speaker 2:  o d means subscription video on demand, avod you pay with ads, SS o d you

68
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,270
Speaker 2:  pay with money. Fairly simple. Just wanted to clear that up in case you hadn't

69
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,670
Speaker 2:  heard it before. Anyway, let's get into it.

70
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,230
Speaker 2:  What was interesting to you about Redbox in the first place?

71
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,790
Speaker 4:  Oh, really many things. Let's start with the brand and

72
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,230
Speaker 4:  the, the very loyal customer base spread out across the country

73
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,430
Speaker 4:  that hadn't, probably hasn't fully migrated to the digital world

74
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,390
Speaker 4:  for a variety of reasons. Not the least of which is some places they

75
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,110
Speaker 4:  don't have bandwidth. That's enough to be able to download movies and watch

76
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,670
Speaker 4:  them without a circle of death, you know, to make, to make the experience

77
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,950
Speaker 4:  miserable. In some cases, they're just late adopters and other cases

78
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,510
Speaker 4:  they can't afford the internet or they can't afford the kind of internet

79
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,390
Speaker 4:  that's required to be able to do digital downloads. They're

80
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,230
Speaker 4:  movie lovers. They're, they're entertainment lovers. So they, they're highly

81
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,270
Speaker 4:  motivated to, to consume the stuff that we have. I mean, I can go

82
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,430
Speaker 4:  on and on and on about this. There were many things, yeah, but the starting

83
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,070
Speaker 4:  point was the brand, the 42 million people in the customer loyalty

84
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,750
Speaker 4:  program, the beginning of the foray into the digital world,

85
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,830
Speaker 4:  the ownership of a very large transactional video business,

86
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,760
Speaker 4:  which is very hard to start. And then the kiosks, which in

87
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,520
Speaker 4:  my mind someday I hope to prove this would be generators

88
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,520
Speaker 4:  of significant cashflow if handled correctly. That could be

89
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,760
Speaker 4:  the cashflow machine that allowed us to build our digital business out over

90
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,400
Speaker 4:  the next decade.

91
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,960
Speaker 2:  The audience is one that I'm particularly interested in.

92
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,800
Speaker 2:  'cause we, we've been talking a lot about who physical media is for in

93
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,680
Speaker 2:  2023, right? And I think a lot of people look at that audience and say

94
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,760
Speaker 2:  that audience is dwindling really fast. It's much smaller than it used to

95
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,640
Speaker 2:  be. Most of those people are going to one way or another find a way to get

96
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,280
Speaker 2:  into this streaming era So. We're just gonna kind of leave that

97
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,360
Speaker 2:  audience behind and trust that they'll eventually catch up. You win a

98
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,760
Speaker 2:  different way. Or maybe you think that's true, but there's money to be made

99
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,920
Speaker 2:  along the way. Like how do you think about sort of who that audience is right

100
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,080
Speaker 2:  now?

101
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,320
Speaker 4:  Well, I, I think it's the people I just described, people who are not

102
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,080
Speaker 4:  sure able to have access to bandwidth, who can't afford it is another

103
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,520
Speaker 4:  category. It's smaller, but it's likely to grow of people who

104
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,520
Speaker 4:  say, wait a minute, I'm not getting the same quality out of

105
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,440
Speaker 4:  a digital download that I would've if I had the physical disc and I had all

106
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,320
Speaker 4:  that additional capability to see things more crisply. I know

107
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,280
Speaker 4:  some people who won't watch a Bond movie unless it's on a DVD. It

108
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,880
Speaker 4:  has to be blue, right? It has to be the topnotch 'cause they wanna feel every

109
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,720
Speaker 4:  bit of it. This is early for this, this conversation, but at some

110
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,520
Speaker 4:  point this probably takes the turn that eBooks took

111
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,440
Speaker 4:  back to physical books that downloads and music took

112
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,760
Speaker 4:  back to actual albums where people

113
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,920
Speaker 4:  started to differentiate a little bit. And you had this growing cohort

114
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,960
Speaker 4:  of people who thought, you know, quality is important too. And I get

115
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,880
Speaker 4:  a much higher quality picture, a much higher quality experience if

116
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,640
Speaker 4:  I actually have the physical media, which is so much more richly packed with

117
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,320
Speaker 4:  information. Oh, and then there's all this other stuff that comes

118
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,160
Speaker 4:  with these DVDs that, you know, you might wanna have actually have seen.

119
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,880
Speaker 4:  You know, so it's, you know, all the extras that that you get, that you don't

120
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,640
Speaker 4:  get in a digital download very often. For us, it's really about giving you

121
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,440
Speaker 4:  access to first class, top-notch

122
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,080
Speaker 4:  current content from any studio at the lowest

123
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,040
Speaker 4:  possible price, the earliest in the ecosystem after a

124
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,760
Speaker 4:  theatrical that you can do it. And so there's something that we're,

125
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,680
Speaker 4:  we're meeting a need that's a little different than that collectible need,

126
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,160
Speaker 4:  that's for sure.

127
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,800
Speaker 2:  Right. Yeah. And I think that piece of the kind of windowing

128
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,720
Speaker 2:  that you've, you're into is part of the thing about your strategy that I

129
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,400
Speaker 2:  think is so interesting. 'cause it seems to me that, you know, you have crackle,

130
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,680
Speaker 2:  you have chicken Soup for the Soul, you have Redbox, everyone else is kind

131
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,120
Speaker 2:  of out in the streaming industry fighting about content. Everybody's making

132
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,640
Speaker 2:  shows and spending more and more money throwing it into their own platforms.

133
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,840
Speaker 2:  It seems to me that what you're building is this sort of every step

134
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,200
Speaker 2:  of the way distribution pipeline.

135
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,000
Speaker 4:  That's correct.

136
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,880
Speaker 2:  Rather than saying, we're gonna throw a bunch of money at David Fincher,

137
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,080
Speaker 2:  you're trying to get in sort of every step of where content is.

138
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,800
Speaker 2:  Is that a fair description of, of how you think about this?

139
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,200
Speaker 4:  It is. And I mean, look, we thought and have always thought that

140
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,880
Speaker 4:  understanding what consumers want is most easily achieved

141
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,920
Speaker 4:  by watching what they do. And if you want

142
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,280
Speaker 4:  to watch what they do, you have to be in that first line of

143
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,080
Speaker 4:  consumption so that you see what they do. And one of the things I loved

144
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,480
Speaker 4:  about, and still love about Redbox, those 42 million people in the customer

145
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,360
Speaker 4:  loyalty program give us a group of people who we know, we

146
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,160
Speaker 4:  know who they are and we know when, when their places and we can learn what

147
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,120
Speaker 4:  they like. And eventually, artificial intelligence can help

148
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,800
Speaker 4:  us, I think, figure out how to serve them stuff on the home

149
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,720
Speaker 4:  screens of our, of our networks that are tailored to them. By the

150
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,600
Speaker 4:  word. I will repeat the word eventually because we cannot do

151
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,000
Speaker 4:  that today, nor can anyone else, no matter what they call you.

152
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,800
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah. Everybody's, everybody's doing a lot of voodoo that I think doesn't

153
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,080
Speaker 2:  add up to much in a lot of cases.

154
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,840
Speaker 4:  No, not yet.

155
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,960
Speaker 2:  So w was that part of the thinking with Redbox that you can get

156
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,440
Speaker 2:  this very early sense of what people like and what's successful and, and

157
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Speaker 2:  that informs like what ends up on, you know, crackle months or years later?

158
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah, so from one perspective, that's what it was about. And

159
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,160
Speaker 4:  you know, if you think about it, the kiosks transactional

160
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,040
Speaker 4:  video, the fast business, the A V O D business, we

161
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,120
Speaker 4:  have some subscription stuff, but it's not really our focus. I don't think

162
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,000
Speaker 4:  that's a particularly good business right now. But having so many different

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,960
Speaker 4:  places that people interact with us as they consume it

164
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,600
Speaker 4:  is very valuable. It is a, a great bit of information that other people

165
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,360
Speaker 4:  don't have. And, and actually other than Amazon, there really isn't

166
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,960
Speaker 4:  another company with as many connecting points with consumers in the media

167
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,640
Speaker 4:  space as us. We are a very unique beast. And

168
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,680
Speaker 4:  that's all intentional. That was really what I was looking for when I was,

169
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,880
Speaker 4:  as I was putting these pieces together. We haven't taken advantage of that

170
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,280
Speaker 4:  yet, David. We haven't yet integrated all this stuff in a way that we know

171
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,160
Speaker 4:  how to smartly take advantage of what we can do. But we've certainly set

172
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,960
Speaker 4:  the stage for that to happen so that, because we have the

173
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,040
Speaker 4:  early access all the way across a, a wide number of things.

174
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,440
Speaker 4:  So that was the plan. There's a flip side to this too, by the way. If

175
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,080
Speaker 4:  you're thinking about creating content and you wanna make sure

176
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,000
Speaker 4:  that as you create it, you're doing it in the le the least risky

177
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,840
Speaker 4:  way, having all this information about what is consumed in these

178
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,680
Speaker 4:  various ways, like what works at the kiosks, what works in t o d,

179
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,640
Speaker 4:  what works in A V O D, what works on fast, that informs your

180
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,560
Speaker 4:  thinking about how you will commit to content creation. And

181
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,240
Speaker 4:  a lot of times, because you're the first dollar in a lot of these places,

182
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,600
Speaker 4:  you have superior economics to people who otherwise were creating

183
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,560
Speaker 4:  content and would've to go through your system and you get a piece of their

184
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,320
Speaker 4:  revenue. So if you believe, as I do that ultimately content

185
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,380
Speaker 4:  and distribution are irrevocably and completely tied to each

186
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,080
Speaker 4:  other, it is the kind of ecosystem that allows you to actually

187
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,120
Speaker 4:  lower your risk and create content over time and get the most money

188
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,880
Speaker 4:  back from it. And it completely blows

189
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,960
Speaker 4:  away the theory that an s o standing by itself is a good idea. 'cause it

190
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,560
Speaker 4:  isn't. And everybody's now figured that out. We've, we've done this,

191
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,760
Speaker 4:  I I've been talking about this for since 2017 that the

192
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,120
Speaker 4:  S five business was a disaster waiting to happen.

193
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,480
Speaker 2:  Do you think physical media keeps being part of that equation over

194
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,240
Speaker 2:  time? I mean, if you, if you play it out a ways more people have broadband,

195
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,480
Speaker 2:  the windowing system maybe changes so that there are fewer

196
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,040
Speaker 2:  ways to get stuff, but it's still kind of, you, you get the $20 downloads

197
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,280
Speaker 2:  instead of the DVD rentals and stuff like that. Do you think there's a place

198
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,160
Speaker 2:  for physical media in this long term?

199
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,280
Speaker 4:  I do. If only because experience tells us that

200
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,800
Speaker 4:  inertia is a, is the most powerful force of all,

201
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,240
Speaker 4:  and changing people's habits is really hard to do. Now,

202
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,480
Speaker 4:  COVID broke a lot of things, right? It, it forced people to

203
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,760
Speaker 4:  change their habits. One thing it did is it accelerated the digital

204
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,040
Speaker 4:  transformation dramatically. But if you looked at our, at our business

205
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,120
Speaker 4:  and understood the assumption we made about what would be

206
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,680
Speaker 4:  successful in the physical space, we said

207
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,800
Speaker 4:  we expected the Redbox kiosks with a full,

208
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,720
Speaker 4:  full of the content that it used to have prior to Covid would do

209
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,000
Speaker 4:  30% of the business that it did in 2019 before covid.

210
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,400
Speaker 4:  With that very low expectation, we were highly profitable.

211
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:27,920
Speaker 2:  Okay,

212
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,080
Speaker 4:  Wow. Which was why I thought this was a good idea

213
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,400
Speaker 4:  that even if two thirds or more of the people had changed their mind about

214
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,800
Speaker 4:  consumption, and that's a pretty aggressive assumption that two thirds of

215
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,600
Speaker 4:  the people have changed their habits, that that would be amazing. Then, we

216
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,280
Speaker 4:  would still be profitable at 30%. And, and that is further

217
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,160
Speaker 4:  enhanced, I'll say for lack of a better word, by the fact that we have a

218
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,920
Speaker 4:  couple of other businesses that make the kiosks profitable

219
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,240
Speaker 4:  at a lower level than that from things other than just rentals. We

220
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,200
Speaker 4:  are putting screens on top of them and selling digital out of home advertising.

221
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,880
Speaker 4:  We have a business that's built around the service

222
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,720
Speaker 4:  company that services our Redbox kiosks, does

223
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,640
Speaker 4:  the break fix of them and does the merchandising of them.

224
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,880
Speaker 4:  We now do that service for other big kiosk owners and every

225
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,560
Speaker 4:  time we add one of those customers, we bring our costs

226
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,640
Speaker 4:  down to service our own kiosks. To the point that I think

227
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,440
Speaker 4:  by the end of next year we'll be close to zero net cost to

228
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,760
Speaker 4:  actually run our own kiosks from a servicing point of view. And that changes

229
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,720
Speaker 4:  the business entirely. So if you took a one dimensional

230
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,640
Speaker 4:  view of this question and said, Hey, DVDs are gonna go away over the next

231
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,160
Speaker 4:  10 years, how are you gonna handle this? I would say, okay, great, let's

232
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Speaker 4:  start with the fact that I believe it's at least 10 years because of the

233
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,800
Speaker 4:  way people's habits are, but let's also be smart and think about the ways

234
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,360
Speaker 4:  we could make that less relevant to our success. Let's use these

235
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,480
Speaker 4:  kiosks in more diversified ways. Let's bring down the cost through the service

236
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,760
Speaker 4:  business. Let's figure out what the right price increases

237
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,640
Speaker 4:  might be over the course of a decade to help make up for some of the lost,

238
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,960
Speaker 4:  you know, customers. And when you look at it on an, on that kind of amalgamated

239
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,680
Speaker 4:  basis, you start to realize, hey, it's relevant that

240
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,640
Speaker 4:  physical media is going away, but perhaps less relevant than people thought

241
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,520
Speaker 4:  when we bought the company. Which is why we are crazy, but

242
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,920
Speaker 4:  not for the reasons people thought.

243
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,480
Speaker 2:  That's fair. So if that's the timeline you're thinking about, do you think

244
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,360
Speaker 2:  Netflix is nuts to shut down its DVD program now? I mean,

245
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,760
Speaker 2:  if if we're in a 10 year time horizon, they're really jumping the gun here.

246
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,200
Speaker 4:  I think if you're them is a wholly different analysis. This is such

247
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,720
Speaker 4:  a tiny little thing in a gargantuan business.

248
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,760
Speaker 4:  That's fair. It's not strategic, it's, it's more like a

249
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,360
Speaker 4:  pain, you know, it's, it's not like it has any in any way

250
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,360
Speaker 4:  affects your core business. Not at all. So the kind

251
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,640
Speaker 4:  of, I mean, the better question is why keep it, you know, the bigger question

252
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Speaker 4:  is why didn't you just sell it to me when I tried to buy it? Because I could

253
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,440
Speaker 4:  have created a whole bunch of synergies out of that business. You know?

254
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,440
Speaker 2:  So why, why didn't they sell it to you?

255
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,040
Speaker 4:  I don't know. They just didn't even return our phone calls asking about it

256
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,880
Speaker 4:  really. We told them, we told 'em we wanted it, but they just, I think they

257
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,680
Speaker 4:  just want it gone. You know, it's a distraction for them. Sure.

258
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,840
Speaker 2:  What would you have done with it?

259
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,160
Speaker 4:  Well, I don't know that I would've bought it, but you know, if they, if they

260
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,640
Speaker 4:  returned my calls, what I would've looked at was, can I create

261
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,880
Speaker 4:  operational synergies and keep the cost lower and drive additional

262
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,720
Speaker 4:  revenue into this portion of our business? There's a whole other question

263
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,320
Speaker 4:  lurking here, which is, who else is in the retail and media business?

264
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,480
Speaker 4:  Can you think of any companies like Amazon for example, that might be

265
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,280
Speaker 4:  in the retail and media business and have found ways to make those two businesses

266
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,800
Speaker 4:  work incredibly well together? People tend to have sort of a very

267
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,760
Speaker 4:  single-minded view of almost everything. Yeah. And if you, if you kind

268
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,720
Speaker 4:  of challenge that single-minded view, you know, they go off the

269
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,480
Speaker 4:  rails so they kind lose it. But you know, there are examples of the

270
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,240
Speaker 4:  retail business and the media businesses working very well together. There

271
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,080
Speaker 4:  are examples of them not working at all. Walmart and Voodoo was not

272
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,120
Speaker 4:  a good example of it. No, no insult to Walmart. They just are, they're

273
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,000
Speaker 4:  not a media company, they're a retailer. That's what they are. Amazon

274
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,120
Speaker 4:  god knows what they are. They're, they're just awesome at everything they

275
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,160
Speaker 4:  do, which scares everybody to death. But you know, they're really good at

276
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,400
Speaker 4:  what they do. So look, I don't think there's any anything inherently

277
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,200
Speaker 4:  contradictory about being in the two businesses if you know, if you know

278
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,520
Speaker 4:  how to be in them. There are a couple of other companies I've learned of

279
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,240
Speaker 4:  that are similar. There's a company called Go Digital, I, which a company

280
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,240
Speaker 4:  I like very much is in both sides of the, both in retail

281
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,760
Speaker 4:  and media. They make it work. So I think it can work, that's all.

282
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,560
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I think part of the reason I'm, I'm curious about kind of the, the

283
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,280
Speaker 2:  hypothetical of what you would've done is, it seems like, you know, it goes

284
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,640
Speaker 2:  back to what you said about Redbox at the very beginning, right? It's, it's

285
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,760
Speaker 2:  a really good brand. People know it. Yeah. There are a lot of people in the

286
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,120
Speaker 2:  program and it seems to me that if you take the idea of

287
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,640
Speaker 2:  this is a very accessible brand that gets new stuff, there are a lot of

288
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,120
Speaker 2:  ways you can go with that. You could just do Redbox by mail

289
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,280
Speaker 2:  and I don't know if the economics work for a lot of the reasons you're describing,

290
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,720
Speaker 2:  but that's a thing you could do. Or there are, you know, you could start

291
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,920
Speaker 2:  selling movies to people through Redbox. It just, there are so many

292
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,800
Speaker 2:  sort of splinters off of this thing that is Redbox

293
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,840
Speaker 2:  this good brand that people know and are used to interacting with.

294
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,280
Speaker 2:  Especially if you're betting that physical media as a thing is gonna be around

295
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,200
Speaker 2:  for a long time, that's an increasingly not competitive space. And

296
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,720
Speaker 2:  it feels like if you wanted to sort of branch out from Redbox into,

297
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,920
Speaker 2:  we just want to own all of the ways that you get acquire

298
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,960
Speaker 2:  and watch physical media, you could have pretty big

299
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,040
Speaker 2:  ambitions there without a lot in your way. Right?

300
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:52,200
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I agree. Well that was part of the reason to look at the, at the

301
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,080
Speaker 4:  Netflix DVD business too. I mean, you know, there were, if we had gotten

302
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,480
Speaker 4:  the opportunity, if we'd gotten the opportunity to have a conversation about

303
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,440
Speaker 4:  it, we would've then analyzed whether it made sense. We never got

304
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,040
Speaker 4:  to that point. I I just thought there were a lot of inherent possibilities

305
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,280
Speaker 4:  in that, you know?

306
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah. What do you think about DVDs and Blu-rays in particular? Like I, I

307
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,160
Speaker 2:  I I grant you, this is getting pretty far in the weeds of physical media

308
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,120
Speaker 2:  here, but I think I, I was thinking a lot about the vinyl thing Yeah. Today

309
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,280
Speaker 2:  and in prepping for this, because it's telling to me that we didn't go back

310
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,080
Speaker 2:  to CDs and we didn't go back to cassettes, we went to vinyl. Because

311
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,880
Speaker 2:  that is the object. It feels better. Like if

312
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,520
Speaker 2:  you're gonna buy the physical thing, that is the best version of it. It sounds

313
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,120
Speaker 2:  the best, it looks the coolest, it has the most kind of cultural history.

314
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,400
Speaker 2:  Like that's the one. And I wonder if we're, if we're gonna get some of that

315
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,720
Speaker 2:  same stuff for movies and TV shows, are we, are

316
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,280
Speaker 2:  we gonna get a new format? Are we gonna go back to like, like is v h s gonna

317
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,200
Speaker 2:  come back? What's your sense of Blu-ray and DVDs kind of staying power

318
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,200
Speaker 2:  over this next decade?

319
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,600
Speaker 4:  I think it's Blu-ray DVD that that gives you the, what you need. You know,

320
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,040
Speaker 4:  we're

321
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,560
Speaker 2:  Not getting laser discs back. This is all a way of winding up to say, can

322
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,400
Speaker 2:  you please bring laser discs back? That's what I thought.

323
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,280
Speaker 4:  We don't think so. But partly it's because, you know, you've got

324
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,200
Speaker 4:  an embedded base of equipment that's quite extensive where the

325
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,440
Speaker 4:  DVD can be used and the Blu-ray can be used. And of course there were a lot

326
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,040
Speaker 4:  of turntables even though they weren't really running that much. People had

327
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,480
Speaker 4:  'em and they were dying to turn 'em back on, you know, to get 'em back and

328
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,200
Speaker 4:  get the, you know, the quality of, and I guess the feeling you know of,

329
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,840
Speaker 4:  of that. So yeah.

330
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,000
Speaker 2:  Do you think there are ways we can make physical and

331
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,800
Speaker 2:  digital stuff interact better over time? Like I, I

332
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,400
Speaker 2:  remember years ago talking to people who said, you know, if you buy a DVD,

333
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,160
Speaker 2:  you should also get the digital downloads so that you can watch it on the

334
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,480
Speaker 2:  devices that don't have DVD players. Yes. And especially now, I mean, people

335
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,920
Speaker 2:  watch a lot of stuff on devices that don't or can't connect

336
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,280
Speaker 2:  to DVD players. It's true. Are there ways to kind of put those pieces

337
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,760
Speaker 2:  together?

338
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,400
Speaker 4:  Yes, there are, but I don't know if, if that's a game

339
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,360
Speaker 4:  changer, but I think it's, you know, an incrementally

340
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,240
Speaker 4:  better world. If you can use, if you can put those two things together, I

341
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,160
Speaker 4:  think it's good. But I I the things that drive the, that drive our

342
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,960
Speaker 4:  business and now look, that's, you're asking me a generic question. So, you

343
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,080
Speaker 4:  know, what do you think about this as a general principle? I always think

344
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,800
Speaker 4:  about it. What does it mean to my business? I can't help that. That's what

345
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,640
Speaker 4:  I do. And you know, so when I think about it from our, our businesses

346
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,080
Speaker 4:  point of view, what drives our business is the fact that we're the, the least

347
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,640
Speaker 4:  expensive way to get first run movies. That's what drives our business.

348
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,120
Speaker 4:  And get 'em right very early and get 'em from every studio. If you look

349
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,040
Speaker 4:  at only any of the streamers, not a single one

350
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,600
Speaker 4:  of them can deliver. You first run movies early

351
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,040
Speaker 4:  from every studio. They can deliver theirs. Sometimes they can deliver

352
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,720
Speaker 4:  one other guy's, but nobody can deliver everybody's, except

353
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,880
Speaker 4:  we can. Or you can get it through transactional video, but that is so much

354
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,360
Speaker 4:  more expensive that for a large chunk of people it's

355
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,240
Speaker 4:  prohibitively expensive. So

356
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,280
Speaker 2:  I guess the question then would be, if that's the thing, right? If you boil

357
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,520
Speaker 2:  it all the way down and say that the thing that we have is cheap ways to

358
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,240
Speaker 2:  watch first run movies, what do you press on customer

359
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,120
Speaker 2:  experience wise to make that better? Is the answer more kiosks so

360
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,440
Speaker 2:  that it's quicker to get to? Is the answer find ways to make it even cheaper?

361
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,560
Speaker 2:  Is it find ways to convince Netflix to put its stuff on DVDs so people can

362
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,520
Speaker 2:  get it? Like what's, what's the next turn if there is one

363
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,440
Speaker 2:  in, in how to do that even better?

364
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,760
Speaker 4:  I think that the thing that drives the business is always content. Sure.

365
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,000
Speaker 4:  And making and getting the most content as quickly as possible is the key.

366
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,560
Speaker 4:  And here's where the window word, which you've used a few times already and

367
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,160
Speaker 4:  I've ignored,

368
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,880
Speaker 4:  becomes an important word. Sure. You know, because

369
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,080
Speaker 4:  getting an organized window strategy from the

370
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,120
Speaker 4:  studios so that consumers know what to expect

371
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,720
Speaker 4:  would be a very good thing for everybody. You wanna make this experience

372
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,560
Speaker 4:  better, make it clear to people when they could expect to see these

373
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,360
Speaker 4:  things. I mean, right now the media business has destroyed

374
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,720
Speaker 4:  itself between taking television and breaking it into

375
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,600
Speaker 4:  5,000 pieces and making it impossible for people to figure out where

376
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,480
Speaker 4:  to watch things. And, and going through layer after layer of search to try

377
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,000
Speaker 4:  and find stuff between that. And the fact that the

378
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,600
Speaker 4:  windowing strategy of the various studios are completely,

379
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,640
Speaker 4:  they look ad hoc to me. They don't look like strategies. They look like,

380
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,320
Speaker 4:  you know, just, Hey, let's see what happens. You know, that is not good

381
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,240
Speaker 4:  for the consumer. We have not made life better for consumers in either

382
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,080
Speaker 4:  of those ways. And good, solid, understandable windows,

383
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,640
Speaker 4:  which are, you know, you don't have to be slavishly adherent to them, but

384
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
Speaker 4:  which generally are followed is a huge service to the consumer

385
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,320
Speaker 4:  in terms of understanding when to expect to see something. It's mind

386
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,160
Speaker 4:  boggling to me that this is not returned faster. So the best thing I think

387
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Speaker 4:  we could do for consumers is come up with a windowing strategy that actually

388
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,120
Speaker 4:  everybody abides by so that they know when to look for things. Otherwise

389
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,480
Speaker 4:  they're just kinda like wandering around going, I don't know, when does this

390
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,200
Speaker 4:  come out? Why is Barbie out this week and Oppenheimer out this week? Weren't

391
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,720
Speaker 4:  they in the theaters at the same time? Why are they six weeks apart? I don't

392
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,640
Speaker 4:  know. Universal and Wi and Warners. Okay, great. Do, do you as a

393
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,600
Speaker 4:  consumer care, which studio made the movie you wanna see? I don't think

394
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,400
Speaker 4:  so. They, what you care about is what is it available and do you know how

395
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:17,800
Speaker 4:  to find it?

396
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,400
Speaker 2:  I, no, I agree and I actually love that example because I think the Barb

397
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,520
Speaker 2:  Inheimer thing was such a phenomenon that there are going to be a lot of

398
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,680
Speaker 2:  people who want to get both of those movies and watch them in the same day.

399
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,880
Speaker 2:  Nice. And that is going to be so stupidly difficult for so long.

400
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,240
Speaker 4:  It is. It's really ridiculous. So silly. We've

401
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,160
Speaker 4:  got Barbie coming to the kiosk within the next few weeks, which we're excited

402
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,520
Speaker 4:  about. There you go. But Oppenheimer's not coming to the kiosk until November

403
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,960
Speaker 4:  or maybe even later. I don't even know at this point. You know, it doesn't

404
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,720
Speaker 4:  make a ton of sense. It's, it's not smart. But this is

405
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,600
Speaker 4:  part of the covid recovery of the media business, trying

406
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,280
Speaker 4:  to come back to a new, a new approach with c o d having

407
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,240
Speaker 4:  driven so much digital, you know, take up, it changed

408
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,320
Speaker 4:  everybody's, you know, kind of focus in the media business to

409
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:09,280
Speaker 4:  digital, digital, digital. And now as we start to realize, well

410
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,480
Speaker 4:  wait a minute, it's really not that smart to only have one way to monetize

411
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,600
Speaker 4:  your movie when you should. You could have seven, you know, or six or whatever

412
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,520
Speaker 4:  it is. And you one doesn't cannibalize the other. In fact, a lot

413
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,160
Speaker 4:  of people like to watch it in all those different forms. It's adjusting to

414
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,040
Speaker 4:  that and changing who's in charge in these studios

415
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,280
Speaker 4:  is really, really taking the time. Because when you really get right down

416
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,160
Speaker 4:  to it, this is just a fight between different parts of the same company

417
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,280
Speaker 4:  as to when they're gonna do things. How long we gonna put it in the theaters?

418
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,560
Speaker 4:  Where's it gonna go next? Is it tva? Is it, you know, you got a different

419
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,600
Speaker 4:  guy who runs TVA than a guy who runs the DVD business, right.

420
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,040
Speaker 2:  And they hate each other. Yeah. Right.

421
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,120
Speaker 4:  And then there's another guy who's licensing this stuff. You know, this is

422
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,720
Speaker 4:  like a free for all trying to figure out who's turn, is it, you know, every

423
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,280
Speaker 4:  studio's gonna go through this in their own way.

424
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,600
Speaker 2:  And then there's just Redbox kind of kicking it increasingly on its own.

425
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,800
Speaker 2:  I mean, does it, does it feel like this is a competitive space at

426
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,360
Speaker 2:  the moment? Like what, what are you looking for?

427
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,280
Speaker 4:  No, no. We're we're at, we're all, let's laugh.

428
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,520
Speaker 2:  Do you think that's gonna change anytime soon? If are, if we get kind of

429
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,000
Speaker 2:  a, a pushback towards some of the stuff you're talking about, are you gonna

430
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,800
Speaker 2:  get new competition?

431
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,240
Speaker 4:  No, I don't think so. Because the physical presence that you have to create

432
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,320
Speaker 4:  to be in our business is so vast and we have 30,000 kiosks

433
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,120
Speaker 4:  spread out across the entire United States. You've got leases with

434
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,760
Speaker 4:  people, you've gotta be able to service these things. We're not gonna have

435
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,680
Speaker 4:  any real competition. What is interesting is the growth of kiosks in general

436
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,600
Speaker 4:  in the country is, is amazing to me. I mean, there's kiosks popping up

437
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,920
Speaker 4:  all over the place that's good for our service business. 'cause that's lots

438
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,760
Speaker 4:  of customers for us there. And I think that's going to be one of our great

439
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,320
Speaker 4:  businesses.

440
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,880
Speaker 2:  All right. Thank you. This was, this was really great and really fun. I really

441
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,760
Speaker 2:  appreciate you taking the time.

442
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,960
Speaker 4:  It is my pleasure. Nice talking to you.

443
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,920
Speaker 2:  We gotta take a break and then we're gonna talk about numbers. Big,

444
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:01,240
Speaker 2:  ubiquitous, meaningless numbers. We'll be right back.

445
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,450
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. We talk a lot on this show about numbers,

446
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,850
Speaker 2:  what it means to go viral and how creators use numbers

447
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,730
Speaker 2:  and metrics to understand their business and just what it means

448
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,650
Speaker 2:  to be a person when everything you do and post and see

449
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,770
Speaker 2:  has a million numbers attached to it. And all of these numbers seem

450
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:02,850
Speaker 2:  so, if not meaningless then at least really hard to make sense of,

451
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,170
Speaker 2:  like, can you compare a YouTube view to a TikTok view, to an

452
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,930
Speaker 2:  Instagram view? Is doing that even useful? And

453
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:14,010
Speaker 2:  how do you make sense of any of it when everyone knows at this point that

454
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,970
Speaker 2:  so much of it can just be gamed in one way or another? Well,

455
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,650
Speaker 2:  our friend John Herrman over at New York Magazine recently wrote a column

456
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,650
Speaker 2:  that basically made the case that all of these numbers are nonsense. It

457
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,930
Speaker 2:  really resonated with me and it kind of made me wonder what we do now.

458
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,410
Speaker 2:  So I asked him to come on the show and talk about what it means that the

459
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,570
Speaker 2:  internet is just swimming with numbers, most of which have nothing to do

460
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:40,250
Speaker 2:  with anything. I also grabbed Alex Cranz because we can't talk streaming

461
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,170
Speaker 2:  numbers without Alex Cranz. Let's get into it. John Herrman Welcome to The

462
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:44,970
Speaker 2:  Vergecast, thanks

463
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,490
Speaker 5:  For having me.

464
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,290
Speaker 2:  Alex is here too. Hi Alex. What's up David? John, can you just like sort

465
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,050
Speaker 2:  of run down the thesis of your piece for somebody who hasn't read it? Like

466
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,610
Speaker 2:  why did you write about why Twitter views don't make any sense?

467
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:00,330
Speaker 5:  I mean, I'll take any chance to write about weird metrics. I feel like this

468
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,130
Speaker 5:  is, this is like a trick that I use at like a few times

469
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,130
Speaker 5:  a year for a decade now, where it's like, hey, there's a number out there

470
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,930
Speaker 5:  that doesn't really make any sense. If you explain that number to people,

471
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,930
Speaker 5:  everyone else will be like, oh wait, that's what that means. Nothing. The

472
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,490
Speaker 5:  thing is that way of like measuring

473
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:21,170
Speaker 5:  everything in ways that are kind of off and manipulative

474
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,610
Speaker 5:  and misleading and, and serve all these different purposes

475
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,690
Speaker 5:  is becoming more and more a part of just like the fabric of daily life

476
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,890
Speaker 5:  online. Like everything that people use in

477
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,770
Speaker 5:  any social network, in a lot of non-social context, just in their software

478
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,770
Speaker 5:  is sort of counting what they're doing and returning it to them with higher

479
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,480
Speaker 5:  and higher numbers that are meant to sort of suggest that you, or they're

480
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,360
Speaker 5:  sort of meant to inform your behavior or make you feel good or make you feel

481
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,840
Speaker 5:  bad. Like you need to do something else. You're just surrounded by these

482
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,520
Speaker 5:  numbers all the time and it's just this background part of your online life.

483
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,000
Speaker 5:  But as a lot of stories start these days, there was a ridiculous tweet

484
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,000
Speaker 5:  and was it the Tucker Carlson thing? Yeah. Yeah. So, okay.

485
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,360
Speaker 5:  Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson kind of counter programmed the Republican

486
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,480
Speaker 5:  primary debate with an interview on Tucker

487
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,000
Speaker 5:  Carlson's show, which if pe if you haven't been following this is now,

488
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,520
Speaker 5:  I guess you would say hosted on X, like exclusively. Yeah.

489
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,840
Speaker 5:  He is just blogging and posting it straight to

490
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,400
Speaker 5:  straight to X and the interview happens, the debate happens,

491
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,200
Speaker 5:  the debate gets like 12, 13, 14 million views

492
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,920
Speaker 5:  according to Nielsen, which is its own can of worms. Fox comes out and says

493
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,680
Speaker 5:  like, yeah, I don't know, 15 million people watch this. If you count the

494
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,760
Speaker 5:  streaming and stuff like that, no one really cares. Donald Trump comes out

495
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,680
Speaker 5:  and says, Hey actually we got like

496
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,400
Speaker 5:  230 million views on my interview,

497
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,600
Speaker 5:  which is nearly as many people as living the entire, the entire United States.

498
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,320
Speaker 5:  That number kept going up and up and up eventually it's like 300 million

499
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,120
Speaker 5:  people. And you know, he play, he's pretty loose

500
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,280
Speaker 5:  with numbers. You sort of, you wanna revise down a lot of Trump numbers.

501
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,760
Speaker 5:  That's we're, we're kind of used to that. But in this case, he was just actually

502
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,280
Speaker 5:  citing a metric attached to the tweet

503
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,440
Speaker 5:  under Tucker Carlson's video. And it really did say,

504
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,440
Speaker 5:  at the time I wrote the article, it was like 265 million views

505
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,920
Speaker 5:  for what was like, you know, Donald Trump has given a lot of interviews and

506
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,720
Speaker 5:  he's given interviews to Tucker Carlson. This was like, I'm sure very

507
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,840
Speaker 5:  interesting to quite a few people in a variety of different ways. It is

508
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,640
Speaker 5:  not something that everyone in the world or everyone, more than every

509
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,600
Speaker 5:  voter in the United States would watch. It's just like completely implausible.

510
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,800
Speaker 5:  Everyone knows that's ridiculous, but it's not just, you know, kind of like

511
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,560
Speaker 5:  a notoriously misleading public figure doing this.

512
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,520
Speaker 5:  It is the platform saying that's what happened. Views a word that

513
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,400
Speaker 5:  we're supposed to interpret like in some sort of way, 265 million,

514
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,400
Speaker 5:  a big number that you know exists, exists in the world.

515
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,720
Speaker 5:  So I dunno you that doesn't make any sense. That's the kind of thing that

516
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,080
Speaker 5:  you would expect to hear from like Tabula or Outbrain talking about how their

517
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,000
Speaker 5:  chum box videos are performing, right? And instead it is

518
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,000
Speaker 5:  like being cited by the former president directly on, still very

519
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:11,120
Speaker 5:  influential social media platform, right? So just kind of walk, wanna walk

520
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,200
Speaker 5:  back from there. Like that can't be real. Of course it's not Twitter

521
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:18,440
Speaker 5:  internally tracks video views and if you use the

522
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,400
Speaker 5:  Twitter for Mac client, you can still see those views, which Elon Musk

523
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,440
Speaker 5:  had removed. The real number of views on that was like 12 million

524
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,360
Speaker 5:  or 15 million about the same as the Republican debate. Nielsen

525
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,200
Speaker 5:  ratings, which again, a big number. However, that number is

526
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,120
Speaker 5:  tracked after I believe two seconds of video playtime

527
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,080
Speaker 5:  anywhere on the screen, which if you ask someone what it means to watch something,

528
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,120
Speaker 5:  no one's gonna on their, unless they work in advertising or something,

529
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,280
Speaker 5:  no one's gonna be like, oh yeah, well if you look at it for two seconds and

530
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,640
Speaker 5:  then scroll past it, you watched it. Like that's the opposite of watching

531
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,080
Speaker 5:  it. However, that is the Twitter video metric. Somehow

532
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,840
Speaker 5:  Twitter is now measuring something that is like

533
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:04,280
Speaker 5:  that, that is like 50 times less rigorous than that and

534
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,840
Speaker 5:  telling everybody that that's how many people are seeing something. And you

535
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,280
Speaker 5:  know, it's funny, it's silly, it's a specific example. It is also how the

536
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,440
Speaker 5:  entire internet works right now. There are just these

537
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,720
Speaker 5:  bullshit numbers absolutely everywhere. They're all bullshit in slightly

538
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,360
Speaker 5:  different ways. They're all kind of like, you know, fundamentally

539
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,240
Speaker 5:  bullshit in the same way. But they're all these like different stacks of

540
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,240
Speaker 5:  invented measurements. They're frequently compared to each other. They're

541
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,040
Speaker 5:  frequently touted for marketing. They're used to just sort of like contextualize

542
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,240
Speaker 5:  conversations about something.

543
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,760
Speaker 6:  I mean, is that true or are they mainly used to sell ads or like

544
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,320
Speaker 6:  convince people to buy ads, right? Like, like saying, oh yeah, we got 300 million

545
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,360
Speaker 6:  views. Don't, don't look into the numbers, but we got 300 million, you're

546
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,960
Speaker 6:  gonna get 300 million impressions if you advertise on this

547
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,520
Speaker 6:  Tucker Carlson show.

548
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,960
Speaker 5:  That's absolutely the logic of the like gradual number inflation.

549
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,000
Speaker 5:  But I think what's weird about it now is that that sort of on

550
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,640
Speaker 5:  its face absurd, but everyone just goes along with it.

551
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,680
Speaker 5:  Number inflation is bleeding out of just, you know, the

552
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,520
Speaker 5:  sales teams at websites and Social platforms. It's now's just like something

553
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,080
Speaker 5:  that everyone talks about and fandoms talk about metrics all the time.

554
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,640
Speaker 5:  They try to manipulate metrics even if the metrics are sort of fake to like

555
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:22,120
Speaker 5:  get their people, you know, seen or in some cases paid more.

556
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,680
Speaker 5:  You've got Elon Musk kind of making the case for his entire, the existence

557
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,360
Speaker 5:  of his entire platform and the relevance of his entire platform going on

558
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,160
Speaker 5:  to like double down on this after a bunch of people pointed out that yeah,

559
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,200
Speaker 5:  this, for example Trump tweet is kind of ridiculous. The

560
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,720
Speaker 5:  other day he was suggesting that 3 billion people

561
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,000
Speaker 5:  a month see long tweets Like

562
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:48,920
Speaker 5:  okay, just the Twitter blue long form content is,

563
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,800
Speaker 5:  is viewed by 3 billion people. Which I'm sure in some

564
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:57,040
Speaker 5:  extremely narrow way is true. Like that content somehow

565
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,480
Speaker 5:  produced in a combination of people scrolling, kind of

566
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,320
Speaker 5:  like loading or you know, internal a p I calls

567
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:09,000
Speaker 5:  calling upon these posts. I'm sure, I'm sure that number of

568
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,720
Speaker 5:  impressions to borrow the ad world term here was somehow

569
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,800
Speaker 5:  kind of generated and logged, but that just has no relationship to

570
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,520
Speaker 5:  the reality of how many people are engaging with something or seeing something

571
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,320
Speaker 5:  or, or like taking something in. Well, and I think

572
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,240
Speaker 2:  There, there are like two sides of this to me. One is this sort of nonsense

573
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,040
Speaker 2:  advertiser metrics we've always had, right? And every company has their own

574
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:35,200
Speaker 2:  special metrics that don't make any sense to anyone and essentially

575
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,040
Speaker 2:  mean nothing. You know, Elon Musk has been doing this loudly with Twitter,

576
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,680
Speaker 2:  like he talks a lot about like regretted user minutes. Yeah. Which like what

577
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,760
Speaker 2:  on earth does that mean? But that has nothing to do with sort of my life.

578
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,600
Speaker 2:  It's just like a thing they say to seem big and everybody has numbers that

579
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Speaker 2:  they wanna make big or small when it's useful doing small and that's all

580
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,480
Speaker 2:  fine and good. But I think your point about the word views to me is,

581
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,560
Speaker 2:  is like what makes this specific thing so interesting? Because one of the

582
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,440
Speaker 2:  very few comparable things across all of these platforms that

583
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,200
Speaker 2:  we have all the way down to like linear television on your

584
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,520
Speaker 2:  TV in your living room is we call them all views and

585
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,640
Speaker 2:  the content is different. The way that they're delivered is different. The

586
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,800
Speaker 2:  way that they're measured is different. But we call them all views and So,

587
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,560
Speaker 2:  we compare this like it's this apples to apples thing and

588
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:25,040
Speaker 2:  they just honestly have nothing to do with each other. Like what Netflix

589
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,960
Speaker 2:  thinks is a view is so diametrically

590
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,040
Speaker 2:  different than what YouTube thinks is a view and what TikTok thinks is a

591
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,840
Speaker 2:  view and what Twitter thinks is of you that we're not talking about remotely

592
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,360
Speaker 2:  the same thing, but because we use the same word, we like obsessively

593
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,200
Speaker 2:  pit these things against each other all the time. And

594
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,880
Speaker 6:  It's kind of weird because nowadays, you know, 30 years ago

595
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,160
Speaker 6:  these metrics were actually difficult to measure, right? Like you had to

596
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,520
Speaker 6:  sit, you had to have a little box on your TV in your house, that was it.

597
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,560
Speaker 6:  And maybe the cookies could sometimes get it, but nowadays everybody's logging

598
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,080
Speaker 6:  into these services, they're logging into YouTube, they're logging into Twitter,

599
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,920
Speaker 6:  they're logging into Netflix. It is very, very easy to get actual

600
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,920
Speaker 6:  super valuable, super like Nitty get into the nitty gritty

601
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,760
Speaker 6:  on these metrics and they're still going for the broadest, most

602
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,480
Speaker 6:  useless metrics they can announce.

603
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,480
Speaker 5:  That's sort of like the central funny thing about this to me,

604
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,800
Speaker 5:  which is that, yeah, I guess we're talking on a 30 year time scale now,

605
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,760
Speaker 5:  but if you think about, you know, linear TV or print publications,

606
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,560
Speaker 5:  you had some data about how many people were

607
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,400
Speaker 5:  seeing your things. You had like, you know, your circulation number or your

608
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,040
Speaker 5:  subscription numbers, then you estimate your circulation numbers. You have

609
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,960
Speaker 5:  the number of people in a certain market, you have all this, but you don't

610
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,680
Speaker 5:  have this direct access to like how people are interacting with your stuff.

611
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,520
Speaker 5:  So the people making media had this need

612
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,720
Speaker 5:  to like figure out what was going on. And so you end up with things like

613
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,520
Speaker 5:  Nielsen where people sit in their houses and log what they're doing and then

614
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Speaker 5:  you do some statistical work on that and come up with an estimate for how

615
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,080
Speaker 5:  many people are watching things and then advertisers use that number and

616
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,760
Speaker 5:  you, you end up with like a flawed but transactable standard

617
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,400
Speaker 5:  that, that people work with. Yeah.

618
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,400
Speaker 2:  At least it's like more or less apples to apples, right? Yeah. I feel like

619
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,200
Speaker 2:  everyone with Nielsen always agreed like it's not perfect, but it's at least

620
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:16,080
Speaker 2:  sort of directly applicable from thing to thing and it's the close enough.

621
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But that, that world had all kinds of problems, but the rise of like,

622
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,880
Speaker 5:  you know, digital media brought along with it, this promise that of course

623
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,000
Speaker 5:  everything is gonna be tracked down to the second, we're gonna know so much

624
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,480
Speaker 5:  about what people are doing. Anyone who's written online for a long time

625
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,360
Speaker 5:  knows that like your publication knows how far people

626
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,480
Speaker 5:  scroll in every article that you, you write and it's, the numbers aren't

627
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,840
Speaker 5:  good. Like you just sort of Ignore that. You just pretend that people actually

628
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,280
Speaker 5:  finish your articles. But no one does like this. The amount of information

629
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,680
Speaker 5:  that you can collect directly now is huge. So people making media have

630
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,080
Speaker 5:  incredible amounts of information. There's total audience surveillance. Nothing

631
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,840
Speaker 5:  that you do or consume digitally is not tracked down

632
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,440
Speaker 5:  to the this like microscopic level. And yet we somehow

633
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,400
Speaker 5:  collectively know less about what's going on. Everyone treats

634
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,560
Speaker 5:  this information that they have as like a trade secret, which has the weird

635
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,920
Speaker 5:  effect of making it basically useless. If it's like, all right, we're all

636
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,040
Speaker 5:  gonna agree on tracking standards, we're gonna do this in a transparent way.

637
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,440
Speaker 5:  If there was some totally alternate history where everyone is

638
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,880
Speaker 5:  surveilling their audiences very closely, which is, you know, can of worms

639
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,520
Speaker 5:  too, but then sharing and comparing and auditing that data in a

640
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,280
Speaker 5:  transparent way, then you end up with like a very different kind of world

641
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,680
Speaker 5:  where there is like, there would just, it would just change the media landscape

642
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,040
Speaker 5:  a lot. People would know more about what people are doing and that would

643
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,200
Speaker 5:  create all kinds of different incentives and demands. And some would be worth

644
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,240
Speaker 5:  and some would be better. However, now we've just got nothing. We've got,

645
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,000
Speaker 5:  everyone has so much data, te petabytes of audience data

646
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,200
Speaker 5:  that is just like closely guarded and shared in the most misleading way possible

647
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,920
Speaker 5:  in tiny little fragments when Netflix is ready to be like, we actually

648
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:52,160
Speaker 5:  tracked, you know, 3 billion watch minutes for

649
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,080
Speaker 5:  squid game, which is the most we've ever tracked. And we started tracking

650
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,960
Speaker 5:  this last year and it's just like, what is that for? I mean it's obviously,

651
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,720
Speaker 5:  it's for marketing and it's, it's a sort of like flex in a particular

652
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,920
Speaker 5:  way to say that. Yeah, we are not just doing bullshit impressions, we're

653
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,360
Speaker 5:  we're tracking time and we wouldn't do that if it wasn't a lot, but it still

654
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,040
Speaker 5:  doesn't mean anything So. we just sort of like somehow managed to take more

655
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,840
Speaker 5:  and do less with it collectively, which is right. You know, kind of a nice

656
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,280
Speaker 5:  common story online these days.

657
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,760
Speaker 6:  Why do you think they treat it like these trade secrets? Because I, I totally

658
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,760
Speaker 6:  agree is is it because they think that, you know, the

659
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,600
Speaker 6:  numbers used to be bigger. The, the media was like much more a

660
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,480
Speaker 6:  smaller landscape. And so a show could have 20 million viewers that was a

661
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,960
Speaker 6:  really big deal and now the biggest shows have like 10 million. And so they

662
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,800
Speaker 6:  don't wanna be like, oh yeah, Wednesday is the biggest show on the platform

663
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,840
Speaker 6:  right now and actually it's got like 5 million viewers or something.

664
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,680
Speaker 5:  I think that's a really interesting question. And some of it probably just

665
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,440
Speaker 5:  comes down to like instincts like, oh my gosh, we have this thing, it's proprietary,

666
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,360
Speaker 5:  it's ours. There is a real tendency I feel across large

667
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,520
Speaker 5:  corporations, but one that I've observed more directly in tech companies

668
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,400
Speaker 5:  that I report on to just sort of treat everything like a trade secret. Like

669
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,200
Speaker 5:  you might as well. And you end up with these interesting collective

670
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,600
Speaker 5:  problems when you do that, that show up further down the road. But also,

671
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,600
Speaker 5:  like you said, with the streamers in particular, they've got kind of a different

672
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,440
Speaker 5:  problem from let's say Facebook, which is routinely racking up

673
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,960
Speaker 5:  just absurdly high numbers. Whenever they attack a metric to something like,

674
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,840
Speaker 5:  oh, a hundred million people watched a a viral video yesterday

675
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,120
Speaker 5:  and the day before and the day before that works for them. They can be like,

676
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,120
Speaker 5:  yeah, that's amazing. Look at these big numbers there. There's, it turns

677
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,820
Speaker 5:  out there's 20 billion people in the world and we, and we found a bunch more

678
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,440
Speaker 5:  of them and they all use Facebook, but Netflix, like you said,

679
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,280
Speaker 5:  is tracking this stuff from a very early stage, very

680
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,880
Speaker 5:  data-focused company. They use it to inform all their decisions. And they're

681
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,840
Speaker 5:  also, I'm sure seeing like, okay, we've licensed a

682
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,680
Speaker 5:  beloved old sitcom that, you know, when in its heyday was

683
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,440
Speaker 5:  getting like 20 million primetime viewers every week according to

684
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,520
Speaker 5:  Nielsen. And we just put it on here and like it's doing okay, but it's not

685
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,200
Speaker 5:  doing that. Or our new sitcom that we just released that everyone's talking

686
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,880
Speaker 5:  about, that's getting a lot of great coverage. Actually not that many people

687
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,400
Speaker 5:  watch it. And that's kind of flipped over time. Like there are genuine huge

688
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,120
Speaker 5:  streaming hits. It's not just like a media illusion that, I mean

689
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,240
Speaker 5:  everyone watches streaming now. That is how people watch tv. But

690
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,320
Speaker 5:  the precedent was set a long time ago just like, well, we're not gonna right

691
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,160
Speaker 5:  out of the gates like rush into some sort of mutual surveillance

692
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,560
Speaker 5:  with tons of disclosures and we're not gonna do that if we don't have to.

693
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,160
Speaker 5:  We don't have that need that people used to have when they

694
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,080
Speaker 5:  worked with Nielsen and depended on Nielsen for selling advertisements and

695
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,880
Speaker 5:  getting their ratings to know how many people are watching our stuff. We

696
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,320
Speaker 5:  know, we would love to know how many people watch other people's stuff, but

697
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,160
Speaker 5:  you know, they have, they have their ways of guessing. They, they, they seem

698
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,120
Speaker 5:  fine with not knowing how many people are watching like this H B O Max

699
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,960
Speaker 5:  reality show or whatever. Like Netflix is fine with that.

700
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,040
Speaker 2:  Well this is where we come back to my kind of like number nihilism and like

701
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,760
Speaker 2:  Cranz, you and I have talked about this a bunch, right? The, the case against

702
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,320
Speaker 2:  forcing all of these streaming companies in particular to share a lot of

703
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,600
Speaker 2:  really understandable apple's to apple's numbers is that one

704
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,160
Speaker 2:  thing it will do is make very obvious how many shows don't work right? And

705
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,880
Speaker 2:  it's great for the people who are making shows that are bigger than you think

706
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,640
Speaker 2:  and it's actually bad for the people making shows that are worse than you

707
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,000
Speaker 2:  think and not doing well. And it can, like, that stuff can have

708
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:23,160
Speaker 2:  real effects on people's careers. And it is anyway because like Netflix

709
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:26,160
Speaker 2:  knows the shows that don't work and it cancels those shows. So that's obviously

710
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,800
Speaker 2:  bad for people's careers. But like, if it starts to be out there, like

711
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,360
Speaker 2:  people used to be petrified of ratings every day because if, if the ra the

712
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,320
Speaker 2:  ratings decided your career and part of me wonders

713
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,360
Speaker 2:  whether what we need is better, more understandable metrics

714
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,320
Speaker 2:  or if part of what we need is like many, many, many fewer metrics and

715
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:48,880
Speaker 2:  maybe this place we've come to where really nothing means anything. If we

716
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,440
Speaker 2:  all can acknowledge that nothing means anything, maybe we're actually in

717
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,160
Speaker 2:  a better place. Well

718
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,120
Speaker 6:  I think the metrics don't mean anything even for the companies themselves.

719
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,240
Speaker 6:  'cause I, I can think of like at least two different shows in the last year

720
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:03,280
Speaker 6:  who did successfully were said to be successes on their

721
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,160
Speaker 6:  networks. Showed like, you know, like one of 'em was in the top 10 for Netflix

722
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,080
Speaker 6:  for the week it premiered and then they immediately got canceled. They got

723
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,880
Speaker 6:  canceled pretty quickly. One of 'em was a League of their own, which was

724
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,800
Speaker 6:  like a very successful show for Amazon, but very expensive show for Amazon

725
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,640
Speaker 6:  and not nearly the hit they had hoped it to be. And it had this

726
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,560
Speaker 6:  long slow cancellation death. That other one was Warrior Nun, which was like

727
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,480
Speaker 6:  another show did seemingly did very well and then was canceled the same

728
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,160
Speaker 6:  week. It like premiered. And so it left all those

729
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:36,200
Speaker 6:  fans who, you know, that was something John you mentioned fans are like

730
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:40,040
Speaker 6:  the most meticulous, they're, they're better than Nielsen when it comes to

731
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,080
Speaker 6:  figuring out ratings. Like they are so good at figuring

732
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,760
Speaker 6:  this stuff out. And they were just saying, well, numbers don't mean anything

733
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,600
Speaker 6:  'cause you published all your numbers which say this and we have all this

734
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,440
Speaker 6:  stuff we tracked that says this and you still went and did it. So what is

735
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,600
Speaker 6:  numbers? And it came down to it was expensive and they didn't wanna make

736
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,720
Speaker 6:  it right. Like they didn't wanna do a third season, 'cause third season would

737
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,280
Speaker 6:  increase the cost of the entire staff and the contract and everything that

738
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,320
Speaker 6:  how flex does it. And that was the real reason. And it was like, okay,

739
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,160
Speaker 6:  numbers are to blame.

740
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:11,760
Speaker 5:  Well this is something where I'm really kind of torn because I work in an

741
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,240
Speaker 5:  industry where people watch your numbers at work and see how many people

742
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,680
Speaker 5:  read what you do and it matters. And you know, it determines all kinds of

743
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,200
Speaker 5:  things about your job and also your sense of like what you're doing and why.

744
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,160
Speaker 5:  But there isn't a world where streaming companies aren't

745
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,040
Speaker 5:  like collecting and using this data or rather data in general

746
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,280
Speaker 5:  to like figure out what to do. And at streaming companies more than

747
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,200
Speaker 5:  at, you know, social media companies which have to depend on really direct

748
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,400
Speaker 5:  relationships between like viewership metrics and advertising and all this

749
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,480
Speaker 5:  stuff. But that's all very like very, very direct at streaming companies,

750
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:48,560
Speaker 5:  viewership metrics and, and their sort of internal ratings. They serve as

751
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,480
Speaker 5:  like a weird proxy, a sensible proxy for success in a way if

752
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,360
Speaker 5:  you're making tv. But what they actually survive on mostly for now, and

753
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,120
Speaker 5:  I guess this is, this is changing is subscription numbers. That's the

754
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,040
Speaker 5:  actual metric that matters. And so Netflix is like, all right, well we can't

755
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,080
Speaker 5:  tell that precisely. This is their version of the old

756
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,720
Speaker 5:  measurement problem. What is driving subscriptions? Like we have good

757
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:14,400
Speaker 5:  ideas, we notice that people stick around after they watch this or they

758
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:18,160
Speaker 5:  sign up and then watch that. Like they have some stuff, but what the ratings

759
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,520
Speaker 5:  do for them instead is just serve as like a way to value things that don't

760
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,840
Speaker 5:  actually, that aren't actually assigned a value in a very, very direct way.

761
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:28,760
Speaker 5:  And if they're gonna do that, I tend to think that like more

762
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,400
Speaker 5:  visibility is better and more transparency about what the numbers mean

763
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:36,240
Speaker 5:  because the people making the shows, the people watching the shows, if they

764
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,960
Speaker 5:  don't have that information and Netflix does, they're at some sort of

765
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,920
Speaker 5:  disadvantage. If you're a viewer that's sort of fuzzy. You're like talking

766
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:47,040
Speaker 5:  about fandom stuff. Again, if you're creating shows you have less

767
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:51,200
Speaker 5:  leverage to like ask for more money or you have less warning about when

768
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,120
Speaker 5:  you're gonna get canceled or you are missing part of the story if your show

769
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,760
Speaker 5:  does get canceled and you suspect that it was viewed by a lot of people,

770
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,200
Speaker 5:  but maybe there's something else going on. Like it's just being withheld.

771
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:06,000
Speaker 5:  And in the context of the strikes in Hollywood, generally writers

772
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,880
Speaker 5:  and other people who work in entertainment, they generally just want more

773
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,120
Speaker 5:  information. 'cause the information exists and it might be kind of bullshit

774
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,760
Speaker 5:  and it might be collected in a way that isn't super transparent. But if it's

775
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,680
Speaker 5:  gonna be used to make decisions, it's better that people who are trying to

776
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,520
Speaker 5:  make this stuff know it. It's not ideal that they have to obsess

777
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,000
Speaker 5:  about it. Like that's, that's a problem too. If there's a world where Netflix

778
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,800
Speaker 5:  becomes hyper metrics focused in a public way and

779
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,760
Speaker 5:  becomes in that sense more like YouTube, you have a different set

780
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,200
Speaker 5:  of problems. But you know, you've also got a system that is

781
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,080
Speaker 5:  somewhat more accountable, where in some small way

782
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:46,320
Speaker 5:  people who are doing creative work have a little bit more of a sense of like

783
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,720
Speaker 5:  where they stand. And that's not worth nothing. Especially when you're arguing

784
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:53,760
Speaker 5:  about like pay that is determined by basically metrics, which

785
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,640
Speaker 5:  again, to sort of like back way, way up are all fundamentally made up. You

786
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,800
Speaker 5:  have to like come up with a standard for measuring things. You have to

787
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:05,480
Speaker 5:  apply it with some level of rigor. Like there is every time you see a number

788
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,800
Speaker 5:  that purports to measure something down to like the most fundamental measurements,

789
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,160
Speaker 5:  you should wonder like how it works. Apply that a thousand times over

790
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:16,120
Speaker 5:  when you're looking at something attached to like a piece of social, social

791
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,960
Speaker 5:  media content. But still, if they're used, they matter. And if they

792
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,280
Speaker 5:  matter then I think people created, people should probably have more access

793
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:23,560
Speaker 5:  to them.

794
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:27,360
Speaker 2:  Alright, John, before we let you go, can we talk about your phone situation

795
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,120
Speaker 2:  for a minute here? Because the, the, the first cast audience needs to know

796
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:35,440
Speaker 2:  you wrote about the iPhone 15 Okay. Which I thought was very smart. We've

797
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,640
Speaker 2:  discovered in the course of doing this that you have an iPhone 12 mini that

798
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,360
Speaker 2:  is literally in the middle of exploding. As we are recording this,

799
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,240
Speaker 2:  tell us about your phone life and why you're getting a new phone this year.

800
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,640
Speaker 5:  So listen, I've been a gadget blogger for coming up on 15 years

801
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,120
Speaker 5:  here. I don't, I don't really have an excuse, but I love the mini, it's small.

802
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,720
Speaker 5:  It was never very good. Like the battery never lasted very long. All this

803
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,600
Speaker 5:  I have, I have little beautiful children, I wanna take pictures. They're

804
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,440
Speaker 5:  not, it's not great, but I dunno, I, I stuck, I stuck it out. I,

805
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,040
Speaker 5:  I I didn't want to give up this little thing. It did

806
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,360
Speaker 5:  overheat while we were recording.

807
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:12,320
Speaker 2:  It's on an ice pack right now, we should say. Yeah,

808
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,000
Speaker 5:  It couldn't, yeah, it's on a, it's on a little pink ice pack from my daughter's

809
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,640
Speaker 5:  lunchbox to kind of make it, make it to the end of the episode here, it couldn't,

810
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,680
Speaker 5:  couldn't handle wireless charging and talking on a video at the same time.

811
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,440
Speaker 5:  So in that sense, I'm so excited about the iPhone 15

812
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,480
Speaker 5:  for work purposes, for the purposes of content creation. I've got

813
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,720
Speaker 5:  numerous critiques and thoughts and and complications about this. However,

814
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,120
Speaker 5:  I can't wait to pre-order the phone. I don't care how big it is, as

815
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:45,080
Speaker 5:  long as it doesn't become like dangerously hot while I

816
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,120
Speaker 5:  attempt to do my job, I'll, I'll be, I'll be happy. So, you know.

817
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:52,240
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. Alright John, thank you so much for being on. This is really

818
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,680
Speaker 2:  fun Alex. Thank you. We, we all we're gonna need to do this again. The numbers

819
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,840
Speaker 2:  are not gonna stop being weird and you're gonna keep doing stuff we like.

820
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,120
Speaker 2:  So keep coming back on John

821
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:03,120
Speaker 5:  Anytime. Really a, a pleasure to join you.

822
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:06,720
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna get to the Vergecast

823
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,960
Speaker 2:  hotline. We'll be right back.

824
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,680
Speaker 2:  All right, before we get outta here, let's answer a question from the hotline.

825
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:55,920
Speaker 2:  As a reminder, the hotline number is 8 6 6 Verge one one. We want

826
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,160
Speaker 2:  all of your best and weirdest tech questions and if you don't wanna call,

827
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,880
Speaker 2:  you can email Vergecast at The Verge dot com. That works great too, but it's

828
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,480
Speaker 2:  always fun hearing the hotline not gonna lie. Anyway, this week's question

829
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,120
Speaker 2:  sent me on kind of a tailspin, so let's just hear it.

830
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:15,240
Speaker 7:  Hey guys, this is Mark from Tampa. I got a question for you and you guys

831
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,120
Speaker 7:  seem like the right ones to answer it. It's a bit of a streaming and a

832
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,960
Speaker 7:  hardware question. So a few months back, during the

833
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,960
Speaker 7:  reveal of the Apple Vision Pro, Bob Iger came onto the stage and

834
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,080
Speaker 7:  mentioned that he was developing a Disney plus app for that

835
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,400
Speaker 7:  $3,500 monstrosity of a system.

836
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:37,200
Speaker 7:  However, I did notice that, you know, I have a couple of kids, we have

837
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,880
Speaker 7:  Nintendo switches, there's over 125 million of those

838
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:45,000
Speaker 7:  already sold and in hands everywhere. Do you guys have any

839
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,360
Speaker 7:  possible reason why Disney wouldn't have a Disney plus app already

840
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:53,400
Speaker 7:  on a platform that big? They've already have a a Hulu app

841
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,880
Speaker 7:  for it, so it would just seem like a slam dunk why they wouldn't have it

842
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,880
Speaker 7:  in hands of all the kids around. It seems silly to carry around an

843
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,560
Speaker 7:  iPad and a switch whenever we travel. So just curious if you guys have any

844
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,800
Speaker 7:  thoughts on it. Alright, have a great day, take care.

845
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,530
Speaker 2:  Okay, I should say upfront here that I am totally fascinated by this question

846
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:15,290
Speaker 2:  and I'm still trying to report it out. So hopefully I will have a firm Pat

847
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:18,570
Speaker 2:  a hundred percent answer really soon. But in the meantime I've been talking

848
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:22,650
Speaker 2:  to people and like putting yarn on a board with people's photos

849
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:26,010
Speaker 2:  to try and make sense of the situation. And here's what I've gotten so far.

850
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:30,090
Speaker 2:  I think there are three separate things going on here and I'll rank them

851
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,010
Speaker 2:  kind of in order of importance. The first thing is that with

852
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:37,850
Speaker 2:  the switch, Nintendo wanted to make a game console first and

853
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:42,010
Speaker 2:  foremost. We've had companies in the past, Microsoft, at the Xbox One probably

854
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:45,570
Speaker 2:  most famously try to do the game console

855
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:49,930
Speaker 2:  and entertainment system thing really well simultaneously, and it

856
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:53,610
Speaker 2:  just really doesn't work. And one of the things that Nintendo has done really

857
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:57,410
Speaker 2:  well over time is just make great games. It has had streaming

858
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:00,930
Speaker 2:  services in the past, but the reason people buy Nintendo products is for

859
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:04,210
Speaker 2:  great games and Nintendo knows that better than just about anybody else.

860
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,330
Speaker 2:  Just to name one example here is Reggie Fme, who was formerly the

861
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:12,010
Speaker 2:  Nintendo of America president and c o o talking in 2018

862
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:16,250
Speaker 2:  about how he was thinking about streaming services. The question was essentially

863
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,810
Speaker 2:  when are people gonna be able to watch Netflix on the switch? And here's

864
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:20,850
Speaker 2:  what he said. For

865
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:24,050
Speaker 8:  Those types of questions, we have to refer you to the folks at Netflix. What

866
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:27,720
Speaker 8:  we said when we launched Nintendo Switch was that we wanted to have

867
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,080
Speaker 8:  a gaming first platform. And that's what we've created and that's what enabled

868
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:36,040
Speaker 8:  us in the first 12 months in the United States to be the bestselling

869
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,960
Speaker 8:  home console in the history of video games. Right now we enable

870
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:44,160
Speaker 8:  Hulu on the platform. We've said that other services will come in due

871
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,080
Speaker 8:  time for us. We wanna make sure that we continue driving the

872
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,680
Speaker 8:  install base for Nintendo Switch, continue to have great games for the platform

873
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,920
Speaker 8:  in terms of, you know, what's next on the streaming side, you're gonna have

874
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,520
Speaker 8:  to talk to those individual providers in terms of where they stand and yeah,

875
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,360
Speaker 8:  and what they're working on.

876
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:04,720
Speaker 2:  That's a little bit of a cop out, but I think it's also true that

877
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,280
Speaker 2:  Nintendo knows that entertainment doesn't really move the needle.

878
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,480
Speaker 2:  People might watch stuff on their consoles, but nobody's buying a console

879
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,200
Speaker 2:  as a way to watch stuff, if that makes sense. And so I think if you're a

880
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,000
Speaker 2:  Nintendo and you're a company that does basically one thing very well

881
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,800
Speaker 2:  and you wanna keep doing it, that kind of focus really makes sense. The second

882
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,520
Speaker 2:  thing is that I think Disney would really like to have Disney plus on the

883
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,120
Speaker 2:  switch. When it launched Disney Plus in 2019, it did a big

884
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:34,800
Speaker 2:  show in front of investors about what was going on and it actually had a

885
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,600
Speaker 2:  slide of all the places that it wanted Disney Plus to be, and it included

886
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,520
Speaker 2:  a picture of the switch, like right there on the slide, big Red

887
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,360
Speaker 2:  Nintendo Switch. And as he was showing this slide here is what

888
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,760
Speaker 2:  Michael Paul, who's Disney's president of Streaming Services said at the

889
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:49,920
Speaker 2:  time

890
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:54,400
Speaker 9:  Right now we are securing distribution for Disney plus across

891
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,800
Speaker 9:  mobile devices and connected TV devices

892
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:01,560
Speaker 9:  including game consoles, streaming media players,

893
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,480
Speaker 9:  and smart TVs. With these device partnerships,

894
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:09,480
Speaker 9:  not only do we optimize our product for consumer experience,

895
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,600
Speaker 9:  we ensure that our service will be prominently featured in merchandise on

896
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,920
Speaker 9:  our partner platforms,

897
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:19,440
Speaker 2:  Right? Okay, so Disney wanted this. I don't think that was

898
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:23,640
Speaker 2:  smoke. That is Disney saying we want to be on all the platforms. I think

899
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,400
Speaker 2:  if it were easy and straightforward, Disney plus would probably be on the

900
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,000
Speaker 2:  switch. But that thing that Michael Paul said about being prominently

901
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,040
Speaker 2:  featured and merchandised, that's kind of the third thing we

902
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,960
Speaker 2:  think of these streaming platforms and the systems that they run on as

903
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:42,240
Speaker 2:  just sort of app stores, right? Build a thing, put it on the platform, everybody

904
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,760
Speaker 2:  wins, but that's not actually how it works. This business is really

905
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:49,440
Speaker 2:  messy and when ads get involved and when

906
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,400
Speaker 2:  subscriptions get involved, everybody wants a cut. Everybody wants access

907
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,360
Speaker 2:  to user data. Everybody wants to be the first one featured in the store

908
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,440
Speaker 2:  and get prominent placement. And there are questions about who's in the search

909
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:04,160
Speaker 2:  and what happens when you search for streaming. Every part of this is like

910
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,160
Speaker 2:  relentlessly negotiated and there's a ton of money in it. It's how TV

911
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,400
Speaker 2:  makers make a lot of their money. It's how streaming platforms make a lot

912
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,320
Speaker 2:  of their money. This is a big and complicated business and the

913
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,080
Speaker 2:  thing about Nintendo is Nintendo just doesn't need to care about any of this.

914
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,320
Speaker 2:  If you remember, there was that email that Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox

915
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:27,280
Speaker 2:  sent about wanting to buy a Nintendo. He basically said that the bad

916
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,840
Speaker 2:  news for Microsoft at the time was that Nintendo and I'm quoting here,

917
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,600
Speaker 2:  is sitting on a big pile of cash and they have a board of directors that

918
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:38,480
Speaker 2:  until recently has not pushed for further increases in market growth or stock

919
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,240
Speaker 2:  appreciation. If you were in theory, super

920
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,720
Speaker 2:  interested in market growth or stock appreciation, one thing you might do

921
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:49,040
Speaker 2:  is hire a bunch of people and get really into the weeds of

922
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:53,160
Speaker 2:  negotiating these deals with streaming services such that maybe you become

923
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,000
Speaker 2:  a streaming platform. But Nintendo's good. I don't think Nintendo needs

924
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:00,800
Speaker 2:  the hassle. It's very happy making the smash hit

925
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,640
Speaker 2:  games, making a console every once in a while. It seems to be a good business.

926
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,520
Speaker 2:  It seems to be working for Nintendo and my guess is it just

927
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:12,560
Speaker 2:  doesn't need the nonsense that comes with being a really successful

928
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,840
Speaker 2:  streaming platform. Put all of that together and I, I think that might be

929
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:19,760
Speaker 2:  it. I think Nintendo just doesn't want this that badly. And so

930
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,520
Speaker 2:  here we are. I think frankly it might be a miracle that we got Hulu and

931
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,480
Speaker 2:  YouTube and Crunchy Roll rather than a problem that we don't have the rest

932
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,280
Speaker 2:  of the services. But that said, if there is a smoking gun

933
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,360
Speaker 2:  here, I'm gonna find it. And if you know the answer and you want to tell

934
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,200
Speaker 2:  me why Netflix and Disney Plus and Max and all these other

935
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,520
Speaker 2:  services are not on the Nintendo Switch, call the hotline. Eight six six

936
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,600
Speaker 2:  Verge one one or email us Vergecast to The Verge dot com. Tell me all

937
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:45,960
Speaker 2:  your answers.

941
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,600
Speaker 2:  wrote a great piece for us about how that service worked, which is very cool.

942
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:05,760
Speaker 2:  We'll put a bunch of links in the show notes, but as always, read The Verge

943
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,360
Speaker 2:  dot com. It's a cool website. The last thing, this is probably the last call

944
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,840
Speaker 2:  for this, but if you have questions about The Verge or The Vergecast that
