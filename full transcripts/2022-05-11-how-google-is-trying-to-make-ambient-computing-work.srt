Description: Google has big visions for the future of computing. It’s working on building what it calls an ambient computer: a virtual helper that can accomplish anything, anywhere, any way you want. But that vision won’t come easy. Ahead of Google’s I/O developer conference, The Verge sat down with some of Google’s most important executives to talk about the company’s vision, its new hardware and software, and how the company is changing to build the future it imagines.

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,180
Speaker 4:  Welcome to the Vergecast. The flagship podcast of tablet apps that are

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,420
Speaker 4:  really just blown up smartphone apps. I'm David Pierce.

21
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,840
Speaker 4:  So it's Google IO this week, which is Google's developer conference. And

22
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,530
Speaker 4:  also the company's biggest launch event of the year. There's a ton of

23
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,250
Speaker 4:  product news coming out of IO this week. And we're going to get into a lot

24
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,910
Speaker 4:  more of that from the software to the hardware, to the services, to all the

25
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,480
Speaker 4:  weird stuff Google is working on on Friday show. But today I want to look

26
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,470
Speaker 4:  at the bigger picture. Google likes to call IO it's state of the union, which

27
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,280
Speaker 4:  is actually a pretty good way of thinking about it. Google is this huge

28
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,120
Speaker 4:  sprawling decentralized company where teams build lots of

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,540
Speaker 4:  things. Often. It seems like nobody seems to know what anybody else is working

30
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,410
Speaker 4:  on. And then once a year, the company tries to pull everything together

31
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,400
Speaker 4:  and figure out what's Google the whole thing, the entire company,

32
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,420
Speaker 4:  all of these hundreds of thousands of people actually up to, I

33
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,870
Speaker 4:  spent a good chunk of the last week talking to Google executives about that

34
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,530
Speaker 4:  exact question. And it's funny to do that, honestly, because you start to

35
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,190
Speaker 4:  hear the same things over and over and over again. For starters,

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,180
Speaker 4:  everybody really likes to talk about Google's mission, which is to organize

37
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,330
Speaker 4:  the world's information and make it accessible and useful. I know this by

38
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,240
Speaker 4:  heart now because Google people won't stop talking about it.

39
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,840
Speaker 5:  You know, our mission and Android is to bring computing to everyone in the

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,170
Speaker 5:  world.

41
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,110
Speaker 6:  I give Larry and Sergei a lot of credit for coming up with this mission.

42
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,040
Speaker 6:  All those years ago,

43
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,550
Speaker 7:  We've extended it recently to basically being about being helpful for

44
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,180
Speaker 7:  users,

45
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,710
Speaker 4:  But every year at Google IO, there's the story Google is trying to tell about

46
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,400
Speaker 4:  itself. And then there's the story it's really telling. And this year, the

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,240
Speaker 4:  story it's trying to tell is about how powerful its computing tech is.

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,110
Speaker 4:  Google talks a lot about the tensor chip and the pixel phones and how it

49
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,920
Speaker 4:  lets Google do all kinds of powerful AI stuff. It also talks about

50
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,430
Speaker 4:  large language models, which are AI systems that can develop a radically

51
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,360
Speaker 4:  better understanding of text images and even videos and how

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,080
Speaker 4:  all of that helps Google organize information computing and AI

53
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,650
Speaker 4:  over and over computing and AI computing and AI. And that's all

54
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,220
Speaker 4:  true. But underneath all that, as I talked to folks at Google, I heard a

55
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,000
Speaker 4:  different story what's going on with Google right now is that

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,780
Speaker 4:  Google has become this huge sprawling decentralized company where

57
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,840
Speaker 4:  teams build lots of things. And nobody seems to know what anybody's working

58
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,680
Speaker 4:  on. And as a result, Google feels kind of incoherent for so

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,490
Speaker 4:  long. You could think of Google as a search company and mostly be right now.

60
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,420
Speaker 4:  It's I don't even know how to describe it. It does all the things. And

61
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,350
Speaker 4:  honestly, even in search, it's confusing, there's Google search, but

62
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,860
Speaker 4:  there's also Google lens, which is kind of like Google search, but in a different

63
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,340
Speaker 4:  way. And there's Google assistant, which you can use for search, but it's

64
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,270
Speaker 4:  really a whole different thing. Google is still more or less on the organize

65
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,170
Speaker 4:  the world's information and make it accessible and useful grind. But as the

66
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,800
Speaker 4:  company has gotten bigger, it's pieces have stopped sort of making

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,670
Speaker 4:  sense together. It makes phones and computers that can barely talk to each

68
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,300
Speaker 4:  other. I mean, dear God, have you ever tried to just send a file from your

69
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,960
Speaker 4:  Android phone to your Chromebook? The whole of Google sometimes feels like

70
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,890
Speaker 4:  less than the sum of its parts. That is what Google is working on. Now

71
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,790
Speaker 4:  it's trying to take the many parts of Google, the countless features and

72
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,720
Speaker 4:  products and initiatives and experiments and prototypes and make them

73
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,560
Speaker 4:  make sense together. I think Lee's read a VP of engineering at

74
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,950
Speaker 4:  Google who works on search actually explained this better than anyone else.

75
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,520
Speaker 4:  I talked to

76
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,660
Speaker 6:  A lot of these newer use cases, there's a style or a taste

77
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,530
Speaker 6:  component. There's a way to process information. Some people really find

78
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,520
Speaker 6:  it easy to process video and other people will find it distracting. On the

79
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,360
Speaker 6:  other hand, some people's literacy is not as good. And so along

80
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,750
Speaker 6:  webpage that you have to read through not only takes time, but they're going

81
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,470
Speaker 6:  to get lost. And a video that's spoken in their language is really intuitive.

82
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,490
Speaker 6:  I think we need to assume that there is no best answer for

83
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,280
Speaker 6:  many of these things. I mean, if there's a height of the Eiffel tower, okay,

84
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,670
Speaker 6:  there's an answer to that. But if it's like, I'm finding a wedding dress,

85
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,540
Speaker 6:  there is no right answer. People have very different styles. They have different

86
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,320
Speaker 6:  price capabilities as well. So how do we really let you find the

87
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,230
Speaker 6:  dress you want versus your next door neighbor, find

88
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,830
Speaker 4:  Multi search, which Liz and her team have been working on is one of the things

89
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,700
Speaker 4:  Google is talking a lot about at IO. And it's a pretty good microcosm

90
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,670
Speaker 4:  of what it looks like for Google to start to put the pieces together. The

91
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,420
Speaker 4:  idea behind multi-serve is that you can't always express your entire question

92
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,110
Speaker 4:  in one way, right? Google likes to give the example of a dress. You like,

93
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,950
Speaker 4:  you see the dress, you want that dress, but you want it in green so far.

94
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,910
Speaker 4:  There is literally no way for you to ask Google to find that for you, but

95
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,600
Speaker 4:  with multi search, you can take a picture of the dress and then type in green

96
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,600
Speaker 4:  and Google understands and processes the search that way.

97
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,630
Speaker 4:  One way Google is making all this stuff work is by making it conversational.

98
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,500
Speaker 4:  I heard this also over and over from Google exact. So over the last week,

99
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,410
Speaker 4:  they're absolutely convinced that rather than you just barking an order at

100
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,890
Speaker 4:  your phone or speaker, that you should have something that more closely

101
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,640
Speaker 4:  approximates, an actual back and forth conversation. And what that means

102
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,910
Speaker 4:  is that in the process, Google can ask you questions. It can refine your

103
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,660
Speaker 4:  search results. It can figure things out better than just doing it. One exchange

104
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,500
Speaker 4:  at a time. I am skeptical of

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,190
Speaker 4:  this. First of all, have you tried having a conversation with a voice assistant

106
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,030
Speaker 4:  it's either infuriating or it breaks, or actually no, those are the only

107
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,020
Speaker 4:  two options, but Google thinks it can work and feel natural and not be

108
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,040
Speaker 4:  the worst. And the reason it does is because of those large language models

109
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,400
Speaker 4:  I was talking about, rather than me try to explain, I'm going to let Zubin

110
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,490
Speaker 4:  governor Mani, a distinguished researcher at Google do it. This is kind of

111
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,440
Speaker 4:  a long one, but it's worth it. I promise.

112
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,340
Speaker 9:  So about 10 or 15 years ago, the field of language

113
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,240
Speaker 9:  technologies really was revolutionized by deep learning. And

114
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,660
Speaker 9:  of course at Google, we've been using deep learning very extensively from

115
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,710
Speaker 9:  at least 10 years ago in language and other domains. And then in

116
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,500
Speaker 9:  the last five years. So back in

117
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,430
Speaker 9:  2017, we actually develop a form of language

118
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,150
Speaker 9:  model called the transformer. And the transformer is in some

119
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,080
Speaker 9:  ways kind of like the grandmother of a lot of the modern language

120
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,650
Speaker 9:  models. So the T in Bert, in <inaudible>

121
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,550
Speaker 9:  in open AI GPT three and metas opt,

122
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,150
Speaker 9:  it all stands for transformer. So this has been an incredible

123
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,690
Speaker 9:  breakthrough that has enabled a lot of these other

124
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,170
Speaker 9:  interesting language models to flourish over the last five years.

125
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,950
Speaker 4:  Okay. Let's skip ahead. A little, here's a little bit on how transformers

126
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,980
Speaker 4:  and new language models have changed the way translation works, which is

127
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,610
Speaker 4:  both a big deal and a pretty good explanation of what it means for the whole

128
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:37,970
Speaker 4:  system.

129
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,900
Speaker 9:  You know, the traditional way you think about doing translation is you need

130
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,920
Speaker 9:  a line text like text in French and English. Let's say to

131
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,830
Speaker 9:  be able to translate from French to English and vice versa, right? That's

132
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,730
Speaker 9:  the way translation traditionally was thought to require. But actually

133
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,630
Speaker 9:  it turns out with some of these large models, you can just

134
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,590
Speaker 9:  learn to translate in some of these languages using only

135
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,490
Speaker 9:  monolingual text. So the model is exposed to many different languages, but

136
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,240
Speaker 9:  it doesn't need that aligned translation. It just needs

137
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,720
Speaker 9:  some monolingual texts without any translation pairs of

138
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,230
Speaker 9:  sentences. And that's the kind of breakthrough that again, is

139
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,250
Speaker 9:  surprising to me is a researcher who's been in the field for 30 years. Of

140
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,180
Speaker 9:  course, when you dig into it, it makes sense because

141
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,660
Speaker 9:  there are patterns in the data that help it extract the common

142
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,530
Speaker 9:  representations between different languages that are needed to do that

143
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,430
Speaker 9:  translation. But it's still a breakthrough that really helps us. For

144
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,240
Speaker 9:  example, deploy translate across many more languages that

145
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,880
Speaker 9:  are useful to lots of other people.

146
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,200
Speaker 4:  Basically Google is turning practically everything from text to audio,

147
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,860
Speaker 4:  to video, to images, into language, and then using these language models

148
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,430
Speaker 4:  to help understand it all. So you can change the way Google understands an

149
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,340
Speaker 4:  image by adding a bit of text or ask it a paragraph long question

150
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,820
Speaker 4:  and have it understand you. Here's Nino Tasco. Who's a director of product

151
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,570
Speaker 4:  management on Google speech team who had a pretty good idea about where this

152
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,020
Speaker 4:  all goes.

153
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,400
Speaker 10:  You can imagine like a 45 minute YouTube video of do

154
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,150
Speaker 10:  it yourself, steps one through nine and a large

155
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,210
Speaker 10:  language model can actually understand that video. And so now I can ask

156
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,360
Speaker 10:  it to play and be like, oh no, no, skip to step four. Cause I already know

157
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,690
Speaker 10:  one through three and the model understands that video. And if you go back,

158
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,720
Speaker 10:  that's like how I would talk to you is how I want to talk to my assistant.

159
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,170
Speaker 10:  So it comes back to the beginning of, okay, well what's the natural

160
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,950
Speaker 10:  conversation look like when it's this back and forth media not just play

161
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,490
Speaker 10:  a video and I'm going to sit and be silent while the video plays, I might

162
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,120
Speaker 10:  play the video and then I might want to interact and talk to my assistant.

163
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,450
Speaker 10:  I might want to jump to a command and I want to pause, go to the next command,

164
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,230
Speaker 10:  but having this full understanding of the video or, you know,

165
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,260
Speaker 10:  Linda can theoretically understand the whole internet, right? And so you

166
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,500
Speaker 10:  can ask questions, cross-referencing documents that you just can't today.

167
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,230
Speaker 10:  And when you think about that kind of knowledge, that can come into play.

168
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,190
Speaker 10:  This need to have more of a conversational interface, just becomes

169
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,880
Speaker 10:  more apparent

170
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,780
Speaker 4:  Like me. And I've said most of this isn't possible yet, but this is very

171
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,620
Speaker 4:  much where Google is headed. Step one is making Google easier to talk with,

172
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,070
Speaker 4:  which is starting to show up in little ways. The big Google assistant news

173
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,910
Speaker 4:  this week is that you can talk to the Google nest hub max, just by looking

174
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,510
Speaker 4:  at it and then speak to it. No hot word necessary because it's using on

175
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,320
Speaker 4:  device gaze recognition. To notice you looking on the same device, you can

176
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,160
Speaker 4:  also just say set a timer for 10 minutes or turn off the kitchen

177
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,640
Speaker 4:  lights and Google understands the commands without meeting an okay Google

178
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,540
Speaker 4:  ahead of time. And in general, since so much of this stuff is happening

179
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,410
Speaker 4:  on device, it's both more reliable and lower latency and generally just

180
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,670
Speaker 4:  much more usable.

181
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,470
Speaker 4:  So that's the big picture stuff. We're going to take a quick break and come

182
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,000
Speaker 4:  back with more on the future of Google.

183
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,560
Speaker 12:  When you were a kid, did your parents get on you about watching too much

184
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,520
Speaker 12:  TV? Did they tell you that watching TV was bad for your brain or that

185
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,670
Speaker 12:  you were too young to be watching it all day? That if you told them you

186
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,120
Speaker 12:  were watching Salesforce, plus they wouldn't have that same energy is when

187
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,690
Speaker 12:  you were a kid, because these are shows you can totally watch it work.

188
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,620

198
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,730
Speaker 13:  Hey folks, it's Preet Bharara, the former us attorney for the Southern

199
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,630
Speaker 13:  district of New York. I led that office for over seven years until I

200
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,600
Speaker 13:  was fired by former president Trump five years ago. Now I host

201
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,380
Speaker 13:  a podcast called stay tuned with Preet, from cafe and the Vox

202
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,740
Speaker 13:  media podcast network. Every Thursday, I have long form

203
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,460
Speaker 13:  conversations with the Newsmakers shaping our current moment and the

204
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,180
Speaker 13:  thinkers who help make sense of it. Politicians, journalists,

205
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,900
Speaker 13:  academics, and activists, people like Adam Schiff, Anita

206
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,710
Speaker 13:  hill Masha Gessen and Daniel economy. As a former

207
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,640
Speaker 13:  prosecutor, I focus on questions of justice. That means I dive

208
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,300
Speaker 13:  deep into the war in Ukraine, the threat of climate change, the future of

209
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,050
Speaker 13:  technology. And of course the legal and political battles that are

210
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,740
Speaker 13:  defining our time, like the investigations into former president Trump

211
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,760
Speaker 13:  and the fights for voting and reproductive rights. I hope you'll consider

212
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,360
Speaker 13:  listening and subscribing just search, stay tuned with Preet,

213
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,220
Speaker 13:  wherever you get your podcasts.

214
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,020
Speaker 4:  Welcome back. So the reason I wanted to start by talking about search

215
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,890
Speaker 4:  is that, well, Google's a search company, but one thing that really stuck

216
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,640
Speaker 4:  out to me over the last week is that Google is also increasingly a hardware

217
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,600
Speaker 4:  company. It built the tensor chip to be able to do more of its AI, work

218
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,590
Speaker 4:  on devices and has clearly begun to bet big on the pixel lineup in

219
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,580
Speaker 4:  general. And for now Google execs all over the company acknowledged that

220
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,420
Speaker 4:  practically everything Google wants to do has to start with their smartphone.

221
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,010
Speaker 4:  But when Google talks about the smartphone, it actually has a vision that's

222
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,910
Speaker 4:  much bigger than just the smartphone. Here's Rick Costello, Google's SVP

223
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,110
Speaker 4:  of devices and services,

224
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,070
Speaker 7:  Our vision of where the future is that it's totally different. That, you

225
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,070
Speaker 7:  know, people will interact with devices in a way that's almost like it's

226
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,820
Speaker 7:  one computer. You know, they interact seamlessly across

227
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,750
Speaker 7:  different modalities, different form factors, different use case scenarios.

228
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,410
Speaker 7:  Contexts. They'll be able to interact with computers in various different

229
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,370
Speaker 7:  ways, voice tapping and in the future, a lot of things will be done

230
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,580
Speaker 7:  proactively for you. So you don't even really it's like an agent is doing

231
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,240
Speaker 7:  things for you. And we call this vision, ambient computing. We want to bring

232
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,230
Speaker 7:  all of Google's latest innovations and hardware, software, and AI put it

233
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,130
Speaker 7:  together for user to offer the maximum possible help. We can be

234
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,120
Speaker 7:  as helpful as we can for users. That vision is one that's very hard to

235
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,480
Speaker 7:  build. Like it means you have to have expertise across a lot of different

236
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,410
Speaker 7:  arenas, both in devices, but also in a number of

237
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,100
Speaker 7:  different technologies and AI and software. And now Silicon

238
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,850
Speaker 7:  certainly for the foreseeable future, we feel like the most crucial part

239
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,390
Speaker 7:  of that is the pocketable computer, the mobile phone that

240
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,290
Speaker 7:  continues to be the center of most people's computing focus. And

241
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,650
Speaker 7:  certainly today, the most important element of a computing future

242
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,880
Speaker 4:  Google in general is making this big push away from being a search

243
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,810
Speaker 4:  box, you type into and more of an always on experience,

244
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,500
Speaker 4:  a thing, helping you and working with you. And sometimes literally talking

245
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,130
Speaker 4:  with you like the movie her all day, and that means Google better make

246
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,910
Speaker 4:  damn sure it's powering the phone in your pocket. The only way this works

247
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,820
Speaker 4:  is if Google is everything and everywhere, Rick showed me

248
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,390
Speaker 4:  the new pixel seven and pixel seven pro the new flagship phones. The company

249
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,870
Speaker 4:  is teasing this week, but fully launching in the fall. And also the new pixel

250
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,770
Speaker 4:  six, a the $449 phone launching now. And Rick

251
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,520
Speaker 4:  said that the key to the pixel six a is bringing all that AI, all of

252
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,480
Speaker 4:  that Googling us to as many people as possible without changing the

253
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,020
Speaker 4:  experience.

254
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,070
Speaker 7:  Well, I think this is really important is that it takes a lot of the capabilities

255
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,100
Speaker 7:  we've offered for the first time with tents are on pixel six and six pro

256
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,020
Speaker 7:  and brings it to a different price point. It brings it to a lower price point

257
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,610
Speaker 7:  at 4 49 beautiful device. You know, it's, it has Google

258
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,450
Speaker 7:  tensor. There's a good spec on the rest of the device. I think people are

259
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,290
Speaker 7:  going to see it for a great value for money, but the big punchline is that

260
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,190
Speaker 7:  you get all of the AI power that comes with tensor on a

261
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,870
Speaker 7:  much more accessible price point.

262
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,190
Speaker 4:  Google is also finally launching its own smartwatch. It's called the pixel

263
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,100
Speaker 4:  watch, and it's a nice looking round smartwatch running. Google's where oh,

264
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,050
Speaker 4:  S it'll do normal smartwatch things like tell the time and get notifications

265
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,890
Speaker 4:  and work with Google assistant. But it's primarily being sold as a fitness

266
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,150
Speaker 4:  device with Fitbit. Built-in,

267
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,380
Speaker 7:  You'll be able to sync with a Fitbit account. You'll be able to get all

268
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,340
Speaker 7:  like Fitbit's latest algorithms for health and fitness. Be able to track

269
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,120
Speaker 7:  against your personal goals. Everything will sync back to the Fitbit

270
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,750
Speaker 7:  service. So you can see it on the web, on your app. And it's

271
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,900
Speaker 7:  deeply integrated throughout, you know, the watch face and throughout the

272
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,350
Speaker 7:  device.

273
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,430
Speaker 4:  In addition to all that, Google's also making a pair of high-end earbuds

274
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,330
Speaker 4:  called the pixel buds pro, which are basically as far as I can tell

275
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,320
Speaker 4:  exactly the same as the AirPods pro, but for Android devices. And

276
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,340
Speaker 4:  Google is even going to make an Android tablet after it spent so many years,

277
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,130
Speaker 4:  basically not giving a crap about Android tablets.

278
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,680
Speaker 4:  So what's going on here? Why is Google suddenly going big and

279
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,550
Speaker 4:  wide on all these devices? It had a brief run with smartwatches in the middle

280
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,510
Speaker 4:  of last decade before essentially appearing to give up on the idea. Now

281
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,680
Speaker 4:  it's saying, no, just kidding. We're back. We love smartwatches, where are

282
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,800
Speaker 4:  forever and same with tablets. Every Android fan has fond memories of the

283
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,520
Speaker 4:  nexus seven tablet, but that was nine years ago. And Google not only

284
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,330
Speaker 4:  stopped making tablets, but stopped seeming to care about Android for tablets

285
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,810
Speaker 4:  at all. Now both the hardware teams and the Android teams told me they're

286
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,680
Speaker 4:  all in on both counts. So what gives here Samir

287
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,580
Speaker 4:  Sammat a VP of product management on the Android team gave me what I think

288
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,560
Speaker 4:  is pretty much the correct explanation.

289
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,910
Speaker 5:  We were early pioneers in watches. For example, we were actually very early

290
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,540
Speaker 5:  in multi size form factors for tablets. There's been a number of

291
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,900
Speaker 5:  different form factors that we've worked on, but I think consumer expectations

292
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,810
Speaker 5:  have changed as well over time. So, you know, the phone is certainly super

293
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,990
Speaker 5:  important, but it's also becoming very clear that there are other device

294
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,410
Speaker 5:  form factors, which are complimentary and also

295
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,400
Speaker 5:  critical to a consumer deciding which ecosystem to

296
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,470
Speaker 5:  buy into and which ecosystem to live in

297
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,220
Speaker 4:  That last thing. He said, that thing about the ecosystem. That's the whole

298
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,100
Speaker 4:  thing here. What Google wants is to not be a search engine,

299
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,120
Speaker 4:  but to be a sort of AI companion that understands and adapts to you

300
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,840
Speaker 4:  at all times, it's a cool vision, frankly, and it makes a lot of sense for

301
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,740
Speaker 4:  Google to be following. It also requires Google to be essentially all

302
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,730
Speaker 4:  things to all people at all times. It has to know everyone's taste, work

303
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,360
Speaker 4:  on everyone's devices, speak everyone's language, understand everyone's

304
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,170
Speaker 4:  workflows and be perfectly personalized to every single person

305
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,160
Speaker 4:  on planet earth. That's a really high bar, even for Google. And if

306
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,250
Speaker 4:  you're buying an iPhone because you love your apple watch, that makes life

307
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,060
Speaker 4:  even harder for Google. Apple has long understood that an ecosystem is

308
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,540
Speaker 4:  powerful, that you can sell devices and services through your other devices

309
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,230
Speaker 4:  and services. Google at long. Last is finally figuring that out.

310
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,940
Speaker 4:  That idea has forced Google to change a lot about how it works, even at

311
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,600
Speaker 4:  a company level. Here's just one good example. For years,

312
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,560
Speaker 4:  Google treated its Android and hardware teams like two totally separate

313
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,310
Speaker 4:  things. And actually used to talk about how Android treated pixel,

314
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,300
Speaker 4:  just like any other Android manufacturer. Now Rick told me the two

315
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,430
Speaker 4:  sides are getting much closer together

316
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,660
Speaker 7:  In our very earliest days, it was like we're making platform software.

317
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,590
Speaker 7:  And then we would make devices on that software. It's very different now

318
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,530
Speaker 7:  and that we really sort of co-design where things are headed. And

319
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,300
Speaker 7:  I think that's just sort of the nature of how computers have changed, like

320
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,870
Speaker 7:  in computing models have changed. So like, you know, the better together

321
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,800
Speaker 7:  initiative is like a key part of Amie computing. The reason we're doing

322
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,730
Speaker 7:  both of these things is that this is our vision for how the model of computing

323
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,390
Speaker 7:  changes in the future. And we're working on it together. We're making sure

324
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,050
Speaker 7:  that our hardware compliments the software that's being built and vice

325
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,470
Speaker 7:  versa.

326
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,730
Speaker 4:  That's one way this push towards ambient computing is changing Google, but

327
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,180
Speaker 4:  it's not the only one Google knows it's set up in this

328
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,050
Speaker 4:  crazy decentralized way. And it knows that to get to this

329
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,530
Speaker 4:  ambient computing, everything connected future, the company

330
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,390
Speaker 4:  itself has to change to solve it.

331
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,310
Speaker 4:  And if Google wants to do that, it's going to have to keep being focused

332
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,240
Speaker 4:  on making all of its parts work together. Google has a long history of building

333
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,110
Speaker 4:  something, getting sort of bored and then building a new, similar thing that

334
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,770
Speaker 4:  doesn't work with the old thing. That's how you get a thousand Google messaging

335
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,430
Speaker 4:  apps over the years. That's why Google inexplicably operated two

336
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,210
Speaker 4:  competing music services for a bunch of years. It's why it bought nest, but

337
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,150
Speaker 4:  also built its own operating system for the internet of things. It's why

338
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,990
Speaker 4:  Google has worked on countless AR and VR projects, but has never

339
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,530
Speaker 4:  actually had one that took off the history of Google's failed projects is

340
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,310
Speaker 4:  like a crazy alternate universe of the biggest stories in tech over the last

341
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:27,030
Speaker 4:  20 years. And it's rarely because Google is dead wrong though.

342
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,150
Speaker 4:  Sometimes it is like when it tried to make buzz of wave and Google plus happened,

343
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,990
Speaker 4:  it's because of the culture of Google is to try everything and

344
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,740
Speaker 4:  kill pretty much all of it. Why? Because frankly, Google doesn't

345
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,610
Speaker 4:  need any of those things to work. It can continue to fritter away, all

346
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,450
Speaker 4:  those good ideas. As long as the search ad money keeps chugging along and

347
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,000
Speaker 4:  make no mistake. It is still chugging along, but you've got to think that

348
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,930
Speaker 4:  for Google faced with antitrust reform and new privacy rules, and even

349
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,530
Speaker 4:  companies like Amazon starting to take a bite of the ad business, Google's

350
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,400
Speaker 4:  feeling a little more urgency as it thinks about what comes next. It

351
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,270
Speaker 4:  also has to continue to convince users. Many of whom are increasingly

352
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,110
Speaker 4:  wary of how much Google knows about them, that the trade-off for all

353
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,980
Speaker 4:  that data is worth it. And if you really cast out in the future, there's

354
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,340
Speaker 4:  one other piece of this too. If you think augmented reality is the future

355
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,850
Speaker 4:  of computing and a lot of people at Google do this kind of

356
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,480
Speaker 4:  ambient computer, a Google is building seems like exactly the kind of thing

357
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,110
Speaker 4:  we're going to need. Nobody wants to walk down the street yelling, Hey, Google

358
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,100
Speaker 4:  message Anna. I love you. We're also not going to want to switch between

359
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,250
Speaker 4:  eight devices just to get things done. We're going to need computers that

360
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,180
Speaker 4:  are massively versatile and switch seamlessly from place to

361
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,630
Speaker 4:  place and task to task and input to input. And don't

362
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,650
Speaker 4:  particularly care about their form factor. Google wouldn't tell me much about

363
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,590
Speaker 4:  what it's working on here for what it's worth. This is all I actually got

364
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,370
Speaker 4:  out of Rick Costello.

365
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,810
Speaker 7:  It's definitely a place where we are focusing as well, and we don't see the

366
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,650
Speaker 7:  market as here now, but we definitely see it as a key part of the future

367
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,970
Speaker 4:  For the record. Ambient computing also isn't here now, but Google

368
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,450
Speaker 4:  has built a lot of the pieces to make it work without thinking much about

369
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,380
Speaker 4:  how they work together. Now, the job for Google is to take all those

370
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,280
Speaker 4:  pieces and turn them into something magical, something more than the

371
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,030
Speaker 4:  sum of its parts that comes in really small ways like Google, making it easier

372
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,930
Speaker 4:  to move files or cast video between all your devices. And it comes in really

373
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,800
Speaker 4:  big way. It's like a virtual assistant. You can talk to anywhere about anything,

374
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,460
Speaker 4:  any way you want. And that at least it seems to me is what Google is

375
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,070
Speaker 4:  actually working on. Now maybe for the first time,

376
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,290
Speaker 4:  The ongoing question is will this vision hold Google's interest long enough

377
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,070
Speaker 4:  to get anywhere or will something shiny or come along and just distract the

378
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,610
Speaker 4:  company again? Who knows maybe next year is IO will be all about the

379
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,880
Speaker 4:  metaverse and who cares about your life in the real world. But I would bet

380
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,870
Speaker 4:  that if Google is ever going to find its next big thing after search ads,

381
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,010
Speaker 4:  ambient computing might be the best chance it has that or really awesome

382
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,760
Speaker 4:  AR glasses.

383
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,180
Speaker 4:  That's it for the show today, but we are definitely not done talking about

384
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,780
Speaker 4:  Google IO. We'll be back on Friday with all kinds of talk

385
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,140
Speaker 4:  about all of the announcements from this week. Plus we're going to be spending

386
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,650
Speaker 4:  some time with Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and alphabet, getting

387
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,040
Speaker 4:  into all of this stuff about what Google's up to. So stick around

388
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,610
Speaker 4:  this special episode of the Vergecast was produced by me. David Pierce, Liam,

389
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,330
Speaker 4:  James and Andrew Moreno Vergecast is a production of the Vox media podcast

Speaker 4:  you on Friday rock and roll.

393
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,520
Speaker 13:  Hey folks. It's Preet Bharara host of stay tuned with Preet and

394
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,110
Speaker 13:  cafe insider. As you have surely heard a draft

395
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,300
Speaker 13:  majority opinion from the Supreme court that would overturn Roe V. Wade

396
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,270
Speaker 13:  was leaked. This leads countless questions. What does this

397
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,900
Speaker 13:  mean for reproductive rights? Why was it leaked? What happens

398
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,590
Speaker 13:  next here at the Vox media podcast network? We've got you

399
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,280
Speaker 13:  covered I'm Khalfan cider. I sat down with my cohost Joyce

400
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,180
Speaker 13:  vans to discuss the legal substance of the opinion and the potential

401
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,110
Speaker 13:  impact on other constitutional rights. You can find that episode for
