Description: It's been a week! The Verge's Nilay Patel, David Pierce, and Alex Cranz rejoin the studio to process all the tech news and announcements. Apple had its annual hardware event where the iPhone 15 and new Apple Watch lineup were shown off.
Later, senior tech and policy reporter Adi Robertson joins the show to walk us through the US v Google antitrust trial that kicked off earlier in the week.

2
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,260
Speaker 4:  Island.

3
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,240
Speaker 5:  Again, again,

4
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,130
Speaker 4:  It's, it's really the same show as last time. We've

5
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,770
Speaker 4:  just slightly changed it a little bit and now everyone has

6
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,490
Speaker 4:  to just as a group agree that

7
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,440
Speaker 4:  it's important.

8
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,490
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The island so

9
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,350
Speaker 5:  Important. It's the most it has ever been.

10
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,190
Speaker 4:  I'm your friend Neli. I'm here. David. Pierce is here.

11
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,440
Speaker 5:  Hi. We're all in the studio. This is great

12
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,170
Speaker 4:  City. We're all together in this

13
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,570
Speaker 5:  Studio and you're back. The rage that people have felt about how long you've

14
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,810
Speaker 5:  been gone, Neli, I cannot describe to you. I am not people just to

15
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,720
Speaker 5:  be

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,390
Speaker 4:  David's like, don't over here Alex. Cranz is here.

17
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,330
Speaker 6:  I'm okay with Neli being back. Okay.

18
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,170
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You're sort of whatever about it. I'm happy.

19
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,130
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's nice. It's nice that we're all in the studio together. It's

20
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,980
Speaker 5:  Nice. I agree with that.

21
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,330
Speaker 6:  We're gonna talk about some phones. Yeah. Talk about some, some stuff that

22
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,210
Speaker 6:  happened this week that aren't, isn't phones, like it's good

23
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,120
Speaker 4:  Times. I'm excited about that. I can spend hours talking about my newfound

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,090
Speaker 4:  ability to crimp ethernet cables, which is what I've been doing in my

25
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,990
Speaker 4:  new home.

26
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,970
Speaker 6:  That's what we're pivoting to.

27
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,730
Speaker 4:  That's, I can just talk about that the whole time. The number of YouTube

28
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,290
Speaker 4:  channels that are like extremely

29
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,570
Speaker 4:  hardcore and they make a lot of videos that get about 40,000

30
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,410
Speaker 4:  views that are just about ethernet. Yes. And

31
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,970
Speaker 4:  it's, it's just a business. It's just an ecosystem over there. They're, they're

32
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,790
Speaker 4:  not like huge views, but it's all very passionate.

33
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,970
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. They're so earnest. It's like you're the guy who knows everything

34
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,430
Speaker 5:  about ethernet and no one has ever asked you one question about it before

35
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,570
Speaker 5:  and now there are people who wanna know. Yeah.

36
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,570
Speaker 4:  It's like the greatest thing ever. Every now and again, you're like, oh,

37
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,090
Speaker 4:  the internet's good. Yeah. Like all these people exist. They've like built

38
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,990
Speaker 4:  a little media ecosystem together and if you happen

39
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,690
Speaker 4:  to need to remind yourself how to crimp an ethernet cable, they are

40
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,960
Speaker 4:  there for you. That's

41
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,840
Speaker 6:  Why they're so good.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,760
Speaker 4:  I have encrypted ethernet cable since I was like 19 years old working in

43
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,680
Speaker 4:  the college computer lab. Yes. And I was like, I remember how to do this

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,280
Speaker 4:  now. That's what I've been doing. That's why I have been on the show. We

45
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,000
Speaker 4:  moved house. I don't have a podcast set up in that house yet where

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,920
Speaker 4:  it's all happening. But I now have a Cat five E line

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,800
Speaker 4:  running from my office all the way to the Verizon modem. That's

48
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,380
Speaker 5:  Very exciting.

49
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,740
Speaker 4:  That's nice. And that took a long time to figure out. That's nice.

50
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,460
Speaker 5:  How are your five G speeds?

51
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,990
Speaker 6:  Are you doing surgery?

52
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. No, I've done a number of surgeries.

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,300
Speaker 5:  Where's the banana?

54
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,360
Speaker 4:  We do have a lot talk about today that isn't just ethernet cables. Addie

55
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,880
Speaker 4:  Robertson's gonna join the show in a little bit. Talk about the Google antitrust

56
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,630
Speaker 4:  trial that happened this week, and it is happening for the next

57
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,600
Speaker 4:  nine weeks. The government is suing Google for what

58
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,460
Speaker 4:  they claim is the illegal dominance of search

59
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,840
Speaker 4:  and using the dominance of search to support its other businesses in ways

60
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,760
Speaker 4:  that are illegal, paying for default placements, killing other search

61
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,020
Speaker 4:  products left and right. We don't know what the outcome of that will be.

62
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,720
Speaker 4:  We dunno if the government will win. They're not doing great at winning these

63
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,560
Speaker 4:  cases, but if they do win, you could, you could see a breakup of Google and

64
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,840
Speaker 4:  this is just happening very quietly. Yeah. In the background.

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,910
Speaker 5:  We'll, we'll come back to this later, but it's been very strange to be

66
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,430
Speaker 5:  here not at the Apple event this weekend. There's this very like

67
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,880
Speaker 5:  Cupertino thing that happens at the Apple event where it, apple is very good

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,240
Speaker 5:  at being the only thing in the universe and not being

69
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,880
Speaker 5:  there, just sitting here being like, okay, new phone. That's a lot like the

70
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,320
Speaker 5:  old phone biggest tech trial in 25

71
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,160
Speaker 5:  years. It, and, and, and we've just, we've talked a lot

72
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,010
Speaker 5:  about the one and not that much about the other. So I'm, I'm glad we're gonna

73
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,960
Speaker 5:  catch up on the phone. It, it takes 10 weeks, which is too

74
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,640
Speaker 5:  long. Like when Microsoft wanted to buy a gaming company, they did it in

75
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,440
Speaker 5:  five days and we were all very interested and it was fine. 10 weeks is just

76
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,550
Speaker 5:  like, can I, how, how long can we talk?

77
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,830
Speaker 4:  It's engine, it's a lot of what's happened this week is Google's chief

78
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,700
Speaker 4:  economist has been called to account for his emails from

79
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,200
Speaker 4:  two decades ago and it's like, all right, this is all happening. We're covering

80
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,860
Speaker 4:  it. Addie's gonna join the show in a little bit, talk about it in detail

81
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,840
Speaker 4:  and talk about kind of why it's so quiet. It is hard to

82
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,720
Speaker 4:  cover this trial.

83
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,500
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's,

84
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,140
Speaker 4:  But we'll get to that. We're also gonna get to the Unity drama, which Alex

85
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,520
Speaker 4:  has promised to explain to me.

86
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,240
Speaker 6:  I swear I'm gonna do it. Okay. It'll be fine. It's gonna be great.

87
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,580
Speaker 4:  I literally was like, again, I was at Apple

88
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,880
Speaker 6:  And this was happening during Apple during

89
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,680
Speaker 4:  The event. Like

90
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,600
Speaker 6:  Ash was like, can someone help me do math? And we were like, no Math only

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,940
Speaker 6:  iPhones.

92
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,920
Speaker 4:  So all I know about this is that there are death threats involved in the

93
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,280
Speaker 4:  pricing structure of a game engine. Yep. So, we acceptance. We're gonna,

94
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,340
Speaker 4:  we're gonna get to that. People get mad Becausecause, that seems very important,

95
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,000
Speaker 4:  but let's start it. It is sort of the end of iPhone week. There's a lot of

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Speaker 4:  what you might think of as pickup news. Like we've just asked a lot

97
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,680
Speaker 4:  of questions and we've gotten a lot of answers. Let's start with the enduring

98
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,280
Speaker 4:  mystery of the Thread radio. David, do You know what's going on with the

99
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,380
Speaker 4:  Thread radio?

100
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,290
Speaker 5:  No. So this is sort of my favorite part of the iPhone

101
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,030
Speaker 5:  launch because there's that like 36 hours where it's just infinite

102
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,960
Speaker 5:  numbers and information and videos to

103
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,280
Speaker 5:  watch and all kinds of stuff. And then everybody kind of takes a deep

104
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,960
Speaker 5:  breath, gets on a plane and you're like, wait, what

105
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,360
Speaker 5:  just happened? Yeah. And, and you guys were talking about this on the show

106
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,260
Speaker 5:  on Wednesday, the like enduring mystery of the Thread radio

107
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,660
Speaker 5:  and gen two. And our team did a really good job of basically running down

108
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,560
Speaker 5:  all of the possibilities. One is that there's a sneaky smart

109
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,600
Speaker 5:  home play that Apple is going for here, where you could use your phone as

110
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,150
Speaker 5:  a Thread border router to connect directly to all your devices. One is that

111
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,830
Speaker 5:  even Apple isn't really sure what it's doing. One is that it got it for free

112
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,760
Speaker 5:  with the chip that it's doing wifi and Bluetooth on. I think all of those

113
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,640
Speaker 5:  are totally plausible. We have no idea. Yeah. I

114
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,280
Speaker 5:  will say the thing that has jumped out to me is I would put exactly no

115
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,880
Speaker 5:  credence behind Apple saying, well, you don't know what's like, of course

116
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,280
Speaker 5:  that's Apple's gonna say like, apple is going to come out a year from now

117
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,000
Speaker 5:  and pretend that it invented Thread and have some cool feature. Right. Like

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,720
Speaker 5:  that's how this works. But the other thing that I keep thinking about is

119
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,900
Speaker 5:  like Apple has made very clear to us over the years that it hates Bluetooth

120
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,800
Speaker 5:  in so, so many ways. Yeah. And I think it can't replace Bluetooth for

121
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,480
Speaker 5:  things like headphones, but it can absolutely figure out how to replace

122
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,320
Speaker 5:  Bluetooth for connecting to your other devices. And it has the ultra

123
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,040
Speaker 5:  wideband chip, it's doing all this stuff. But if you can use Thread as just

124
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,830
Speaker 5:  like a free way to get rid of this awful power hungry standard

125
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,720
Speaker 5:  that no one really likes. That makes a lot of sense to me as

126
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,220
Speaker 5:  a thing Apple might do. There's a long road to get there. You have to put

127
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,880
Speaker 5:  in all the devices, you have to put it on all the phones. But like if you

128
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,940
Speaker 5:  were going to start somewhere, it makes sense to start with the iPhone Pro.

129
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,640
Speaker 5:  It makes sense to sort of slowly trickle it out. And then in two years they're

130
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,960
Speaker 5:  gonna have a big smart home event and tell us all the cool things they've

131
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,120
Speaker 5:  done with Thread. Like I can see how we get from here today. What

132
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,130
Speaker 6:  Would the cool things be? Just like turning off

133
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,220
Speaker 6:  bulbs.

134
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,200
Speaker 4:  Yes. What are the cool things?

135
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,080
Speaker 6:  I mean, I like to turn, like using Thread is nice to turn off bulbs.

136
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,000
Speaker 6:  I enjoy it as much as you can enjoy doing

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,860
Speaker 6:  that. But like,

138
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,570
Speaker 5:  No, the the, the answer is we made the smart home work,

139
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,960
Speaker 5:  right? Like if I'm Apple, I'm looking at matter being like, well that's a

140
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,040
Speaker 5:  gigantic disaster. We'll figure that out eventually Matter is the long-term

141
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,600
Speaker 5:  answer. It's not the short-term answer, but what Apple can do is come out

142
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,800
Speaker 5:  and say like, we now have a solution in

143
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,720
Speaker 5:  which you go to your iPhone and you hit the button that says Turn

144
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,580
Speaker 5:  my lights on. And it connects to the lights and turns them on

145
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,440
Speaker 5:  no other steps. Yeah. Yeah. That's powerful. And would mean things to

146
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,560
Speaker 5:  people. You don't have to worry about your Hue bridge. You don't have to

147
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,240
Speaker 5:  make sure that your network is working. You don't have to like, you just,

148
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,760
Speaker 5:  you have a device. That device is over there. You hit a button, it turns

149
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,800
Speaker 5:  on. That's an Apple story would

150
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,520
Speaker 6:  Work without needing wifi. Right.

151
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,040
Speaker 5:  You wouldn't.

152
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,210
Speaker 6:  Which is the best part of Hu hu

153
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,160
Speaker 4:  Again, here's my question and I I I believe you that it

154
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,800
Speaker 4:  is unlikely that Apple announced it without a plan, but it's weird that they

155
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,430
Speaker 4:  announced it without a plan.

156
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,070
Speaker 6:  Well, they didn't announce it though, right?

157
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,160
Speaker 4:  They did. It's on the It's during the keynote. It's in the Bento in the Bento

158
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,280
Speaker 4:  box and it's in the press release. Yeah. But that's like, they could have

159
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,520
Speaker 4:  just not told anybody that. That's

160
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,160
Speaker 5:  Fair. Also, do you remember when they, they upgraded the home app and they

161
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Speaker 5:  were like, it's for future architectural improvements. What the hell does

162
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,010
Speaker 5:  that mean? Like Apple, I think I really genuinely believe

163
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,840
Speaker 5:  Apple thinks the smart home is for nerds. Yeah. And is just like very

164
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,760
Speaker 5:  slowly building up a thing that at three years from now they're

165
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,600
Speaker 5:  gonna be like, we've invented the smart home. And it starts in that

166
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,720
Speaker 5:  little radio. It's

167
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,080
Speaker 6:  Gonna be like a slow zoom on a light bulb and then it just pops on. Yeah.

168
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,420
Speaker 6:  Right. And we're gonna be like, wow.

169
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,460
Speaker 4:  No, no, no, no, no,

170
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,280
Speaker 5:  No. This is gonna happen.

171
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,160
Speaker 4:  They built that entire house that they do their announcements and it dubbed

172
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,920
Speaker 4:  into dc Right. They're like Apple's smart house, more like

173
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,280
Speaker 4:  beautiful people are doing beautiful things all the time. And like someone's

174
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,070
Speaker 4:  making a pancake and a home pod minis like opening a garage. Like

175
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,040
Speaker 4:  they, they, they can't ret Con not having done

176
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,470
Speaker 4:  that.

177
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,230
Speaker 5:  They absolutely can.

178
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,640
Speaker 4:  They

179
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,010
Speaker 5:  Absolutely can.

180
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,320
Speaker 6:  There will be a birthday party, the lights are gonna pop on and everybody's

181
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,660
Speaker 6:  gonna go,

182
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,640
Speaker 4:  Wow. Yeah. We've gotten a number of emails with Thread theories.

183
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,280
Speaker 4:  I think the most interesting ones are all about local connectivity. A lot

184
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,980
Speaker 4:  of people think, well this could be better for connecting to smart watches

185
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,640
Speaker 4:  or AirPods the answer. And you should read Jen's piece. We'll link it. It's

186
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,240
Speaker 4:  very good. She basically ran everything down as David said. And she's got

187
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,350
Speaker 4:  a bunch of actual reporting from people at other companies who use Thread.

188
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,320
Speaker 4:  Like Google product managers are in this piece talking about what they would

189
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,040
Speaker 4:  put Thread in a smartphone for, which is really interesting. So go read that

190
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,000
Speaker 4:  piece. But basically the bandwidth of Thread is not gonna let you

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,860
Speaker 4:  build that like tiny personal area network that people are talking about

192
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,960
Speaker 4:  at this moment. And then there's a lot of like, is it for presence

193
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,590
Speaker 4:  detection and all this other stuff you can think of. And the

194
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,540
Speaker 4:  problem with that is that Bluetooth low energy does exist.

195
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,520
Speaker 5:  It does. It's still

196
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,230
Speaker 4:  There. It is there, it, it does that job actually quite

197
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,130
Speaker 4:  well. And so you're, you're just in this weird

198
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,360
Speaker 4:  place where you have ultra wideband, you have Thread, you've got B L

199
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,960
Speaker 4:  E and everyone's like, well maybe we'll use this one to do the thing that

200
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,840
Speaker 4:  that one's designed for. Like have you seen these new, well how do you

201
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,670
Speaker 4:  pronounce this company? A, A Aqura? Yes. Ara Aqua. They've got the presence

202
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,520
Speaker 4:  sensors now. Yeah. And so they have basically u w E presence sensors and

203
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,880
Speaker 4:  they can tell where you are in a room. Like you can set them up, it'll map

204
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,920
Speaker 4:  out the room. You walk into the room and beyond just there's motion in the

205
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,360
Speaker 4:  room, turn on the light. It's like I'm at the desk. Yeah. Turn on the desk

206
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,310
Speaker 4:  light because I'm at the desk and when I leave the desk and go to the couch,

207
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,000
Speaker 4:  turn off that light and turn on this thing now that's terrifying. I

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,070
Speaker 6:  Was just thinking how I was like, I need to go get that sensor.

209
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah. There, there's a, I You go watch the videos of people using. It's

210
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,960
Speaker 4:  so cool. Yeah. And like it is a big unlock. Again, Jenna's

211
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,360
Speaker 4:  written about all this stuff. It is a huge unlock for smart home ideas because

212
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,090
Speaker 4:  knowing you're in a room is actually not that useful. Knowing

213
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,680
Speaker 4:  where you are and what you might be doing in a room is very useful. But then

214
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,380
Speaker 4:  you have to tell computers where you are and what you are doing in a room.

215
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,220
Speaker 4:  And then the computers will know and store that data

216
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,580
Speaker 4:  and

217
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,460
Speaker 6:  Or you can use home assistant and then a lot of that data

218
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,080
Speaker 6:  and stuff is not stored Yeah. By the companies. Instead it's just your

219
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,640
Speaker 6:  data.

220
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,020
Speaker 4:  I you Plex home assistant.

221
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,000
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm out there. I'm out there at the edge. No one's got my data

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,520
Speaker 6:  literally

223
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,320
Speaker 4:  At, on the edge on. But anyway, so all this stuff

224
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,080
Speaker 4:  is just, all these, these kinds of radios, the blurry lines

225
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,940
Speaker 4:  between them are ever more blurry. Yes. And Apple in the,

226
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,740
Speaker 4:  in the phone has all three of them. You know there's a second

227
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,360
Speaker 4:  gen ultra wideband ship in these phones. And then there's

228
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,760
Speaker 4:  just, it's like, I know they didn't announce it without a plan. I know there's

229
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,560
Speaker 4:  a plan. They're not telling us. Yeah. But the announcement is an

230
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,960
Speaker 4:  announcement without a plan. They're gonna

231
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,380
Speaker 6:  Announce it like, dub up.

232
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,370
Speaker 5:  If you just got it for free with the chip, you don't put it in the

233
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,600
Speaker 5:  Bento. You let like I fix it, open it up and be like, huh, weird. There's

234
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,460
Speaker 5:  a Thread router in there. And then never touch it again.

235
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,720
Speaker 5:  And don't talk about it. Don't answer questions. Like, we've seen Apple do

236
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,000
Speaker 5:  this before where you're like, what is this for? And Apple's like, what do

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,240
Speaker 5:  you mean? Like that's all fine. But Yeah. I I think it's right that they're

238
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,200
Speaker 5:  like, they, they wanna put Thread in people's minds and exactly why

239
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,640
Speaker 5:  that is. I don't know. But I think you're right that there's, there is some

240
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,450
Speaker 5:  kind of bet there. It's just a question of like how big and how soon. Yeah.

241
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,140
Speaker 5:  We're gonna see something out of that.

242
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,920
Speaker 4:  And what what's fun for us is that Vergecast

243
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,470
Speaker 4:  listeners, Verge readers are, they're as interested in this mystery.

244
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like this post, like what is Thread in the iPhone for is like right

245
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,840
Speaker 4:  up there with like iPhone announced. Oh yeah. And it's great. Like that's

246
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,440
Speaker 4:  why we do the thing that we do. Other stuff that we picked up Lightning is

247
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,300
Speaker 4:  not totally gone. Yep. It's still around. I mean Apple still sells the ninth

248
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,180
Speaker 4:  Gen I've iPad. All the AirPods except for the AirPods pros still have it.

249
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,920
Speaker 5:  It does seem like we're gonna, we're in for probably, I don't know, what

250
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,560
Speaker 5:  would you say, 12 months of kind of slowly wiping those things out. Like

251
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,360
Speaker 5:  if we get to this time next year and there is still a single Apple

252
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,920
Speaker 5:  device with a Lightning port, I'll be very

253
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,200
Speaker 6:  Surprised It'll be a budget iPad maybe. And it'll be there for like three

254
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,720
Speaker 6:  more years with the, with the, the pencil that you plug

255
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,520
Speaker 6:  in and then three years. No,

256
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,360
Speaker 5:  They're gonna gonna leave the Magic Mouse with the stupid ass Lightning port

257
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,910
Speaker 5:  on the bottom just to troll everybody.

258
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,360
Speaker 4:  Well I mean that stuff is really interesting 'cause those are wholesale

259
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,240
Speaker 4:  redesigns. Yeah. You know Apple's view of USB C is basically we

260
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,160
Speaker 4:  invented this port, it's ours and it's it's true. Yeah. With

261
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,200
Speaker 4:  that first baby MacBook, of which by the way, I got rid of them. Very sad

262
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,160
Speaker 4:  about them when we moved. I was like, it's time. Ah, Dieter sold me one a

263
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,320
Speaker 4:  long time ago.

264
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,340
Speaker 5:  R i p Terrible beautiful computers.

265
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,680
Speaker 4:  The ultimate plane computer. I kept them in my house for years after they

266
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,360
Speaker 4:  were obsolete thinking I will have these just for airplane rides. And then

267
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,920
Speaker 4:  every now and again I'd be like, go on a long flight and I would open one

268
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,590
Speaker 4:  up and be like, this is so much slower than that. This is so much

269
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,480
Speaker 4:  objectively worse than any iPad in this house, including Max's iPad,

270
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,600
Speaker 4:  which is like lockdown kids mode. Did

271
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,580
Speaker 6:  You put like Chrome OS on it?

272
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,560
Speaker 4:  No, I thought about it. I was like, I can just purchase a

273
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,340
Speaker 4:  Chromebook for no money

274
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:53,960
Speaker 5:  And not spend

275
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,910
Speaker 6:  Like six hours.

276
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like you walk into like any carrier retail store and you're like, I

277
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Speaker 4:  might upgrade my plan. They're like Chromebook. Yeah. Do you want one crisp

278
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,880
Speaker 4:  be it at you Anyhow Apple invented the USB C

279
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,840
Speaker 4:  port basically because the USB i f was going down

280
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,760
Speaker 4:  a bad direction and they wanted it for that MacBook. Yeah. So Apple's view

281
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,040
Speaker 4:  is like

282
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,400
Speaker 5:  Apple invented is strong, but it's not that far off. Like

283
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,230
Speaker 4:  Well, it's like

284
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,520
Speaker 6:  What? It participated hard.

285
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,700
Speaker 5:  Apple probably deserves more credit than any other company for the existence

286
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,600
Speaker 5:  of USB C. But like a lot of people made USB C, which is why

287
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,240
Speaker 5:  USB C is good. Right. Because everybody sat in a room and agreed this is

288
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,190
Speaker 5:  the standard we're gonna Yeah. Live with it.

289
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,990
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But like in that room, apple had a knife.

290
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,000
Speaker 5:  Sure. It's like, it's like Google and Chromium, right? Yeah. Like Chromium

291
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,360
Speaker 5:  is technically an open source browser and you can do whatever you'd like

292
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,240
Speaker 5:  with it. But someone from Google will stand outside of your house. Yeah,

293
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,040
Speaker 4:  Exactly. If you Yeah, like Apple's, like we know where all of you live, you

294
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,200
Speaker 4:  have our phones, right? We've handed your iCloud credentials to the Chinese

295
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,640
Speaker 4:  government. It's just the thing that we've done. Yes. Don't worry about it.

296
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,480
Speaker 4:  But anyway, so Apple in in general is like happy about USB

297
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,920
Speaker 4:  C I think they're not happy about losing the revenue. I think they're not

298
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,560
Speaker 4:  happy about being forced to it because of the Europeans. But you can't just

299
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,480
Speaker 4:  switch the iPad, the ninth gen iPad to pc. You have to re-architect

300
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,460
Speaker 4:  that product. Yes. So I think that just gets phased out. AirPods,

301
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,320
Speaker 4:  Max, apple doesn't even acknowledge that these, this product exists. And

302
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,080
Speaker 4:  I see more of them than anything else. Yeah.

303
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,190
Speaker 5:  They're clearly very popular.

304
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,070
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Always on the planes. Yeah. Like I, I think that I need to buy them

305
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,360
Speaker 6:  when I get on a plane. I'm like, well everybody, everybody has them. Yeah.

306
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,550
Speaker 6:  I should have them too. They're everywhere.

307
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,180
Speaker 4:  Have you ever stopped to ask these people like, so tell me about the case

308
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,550
Speaker 4:  it came with, do you use it?

309
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:35,020
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I never see the little purse. Never see the purse.

310
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,110
Speaker 4:  But like Lightning on the AirPods Max, the regular

311
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,680
Speaker 4:  AirPods. Like, I mean this is a lot of products that need to be updated.

312
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,880
Speaker 4:  I don't think it's quite as simple that Mouse, there

313
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,400
Speaker 5:  Are a handful of them that they can just kind of get for free. Yeah. Right.

314
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,080
Speaker 5:  That you just stick a new port in and it'll be fine. Like the, the

315
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,560
Speaker 5:  magic keyboard is a good example, right? Like changing that to USB C will

316
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,480
Speaker 5:  not be hard work. I actually think that base level iPad, I think

317
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,800
Speaker 5:  you're right, is the most interesting one because A, that thing is probably

318
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,760
Speaker 5:  due for a bit of a redesign anyway. B, it's

319
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,680
Speaker 5:  clearly very popular. Like Apple talks about that thing way more than you

320
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,160
Speaker 5:  would think it would for like a pretty cheap entry level product. It's clear,

321
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,080
Speaker 5:  it's a meaningful thing to Apple. And so I suspect that one is going

322
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,840
Speaker 5:  to be the one that we see like look the most different. Yeah. And also come

323
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,800
Speaker 5:  with USB C Well

324
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,280
Speaker 6:  And a lot of that was like they're trying to get rid of old inventory and

325
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,160
Speaker 6:  stuff too here. Right. Like that's why they, it still has the, the dorky

326
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,670
Speaker 6:  pencil and everything like that. No disrespect. Yeah.

327
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,600
Speaker 5:  Some some disrespect.

328
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,520
Speaker 6:  Some disrespect. Yeah. Some some, I I do think it's gonna be a

329
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,160
Speaker 6:  minute. I don't think they're just going to flip a switch because they do

330
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,080
Speaker 6:  still need to get rid of all of that stuff. Yeah. And that's why they're

331
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,830
Speaker 6:  so rich now is because they're really good at like unloading old crap

332
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,280
Speaker 6:  that they're great at it. The iPhone

333
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,640
Speaker 4:  Mini. How'd get Mini? How Get Rich Tim? Well I unloaded old crap. But

334
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,420
Speaker 6:  They, they would like, they they they jazz it up. Like they put some makeup

335
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,070
Speaker 6:  on, like it they, they'd contour like it looked nice. Wow.

336
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That the iPhone Mini man it was gorgeous.

337
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,260
Speaker 4:  Gorgeous device. It was so gorgeous Old phone. Just like the iPhone 15.

338
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,460
Speaker 5:  It sounds so dead. I just saw what So, so, so, so dead.

339
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,380
Speaker 6:  Our producer has one and it's the cutest little thing in the world.

340
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,440
Speaker 5:  Andrew Marino, our producer just bought another one like a

341
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,240
Speaker 5:  psychopath because it's about to be gone forever. Liam, our

342
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,800
Speaker 5:  other producer is holding on God The Verge cast. What a disaster of a show.

343
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,520
Speaker 5:  This is just all minis. There's just iPhone Minis.

344
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,120
Speaker 4:  They're wave at us.

345
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,200
Speaker 5:  They're the last two.

346
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,760
Speaker 4:  This is like Walt Mossberg at the end of the MacBook Air Run. He just bought

347
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,560
Speaker 4:  like two of them. Yeah, yeah. To have them in case Apple screwed it up in

348
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,480
Speaker 4:  the future. That's

349
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,240
Speaker 6:  Smart. I I

350
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,880
Speaker 4:  Would do that. That's good. Speaking of USB C in general, we've

351
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,110
Speaker 4:  learned a lot about the Port and what it will

352
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,100
Speaker 4:  support and basically the answer is everything. Like Apple did this the right

353
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,320
Speaker 4:  way.

354
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,420
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It seems to be

355
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,560
Speaker 4:  So back 'cause they had

356
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,380
Speaker 6:  A moral obligation to David. God

357
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,160
Speaker 4:  That's what gets Apple to think. Yeah. So Backbone one controllers are just

358
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,680
Speaker 4:  gonna get upgraded and they're gonna work with the iPhone and I actually

359
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,190
Speaker 4:  saw some Backbone folks at the event they were

360
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,730
Speaker 4:  excited and they were just handing out the Android Backbone controllers to,

361
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,040
Speaker 4:  there were a lot of games reporters there. Yeah. So that's cool. Like it's

362
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,920
Speaker 4:  cool that that just works. Apparently you can plug in just sort of any

363
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,680
Speaker 4:  USB C hub and get like ethernet on your phone. Oh wow. Like

364
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,280
Speaker 4:  basically anything that would work on the iPad Pro is gonna just

365
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,700
Speaker 4:  happen over here.

366
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,720
Speaker 5:  That's cool. That's much bigger than I expected

367
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,560
Speaker 6:  Actually. Well you're at the office and you have the crappy wifi and they're

368
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,520
Speaker 6:  always the, it is always like just plug into the ethernet and you're like

369
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,710
Speaker 6:  I hate you. I'm on my phone now You can just be like,

370
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,560
Speaker 5:  Plug your phone in. Fine. Yeah.

371
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Speaker 4:  I don't know how any of that's gonna work. My experience doing any of this

372
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,420
Speaker 4:  stuff with an iPad is always a little like you just hope the

373
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,120
Speaker 4:  You know the magic of the iPad magics at you. It's gonna be even

374
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,920
Speaker 4:  weirder with a phone. I and You know I s 17 is another bit of a wild

375
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,640
Speaker 4:  card here. So, but theoretically we

376
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,360
Speaker 6:  Have decks for the

377
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,600
Speaker 4:  Phone. It's just gonna work. Yeah.

378
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,160
Speaker 5:  I mean the Backbone thing to me is like the perfect example of how this ought

379
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,070
Speaker 5:  to be and I think it's very exciting where they're just like, oh this thing

380
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,440
Speaker 5:  that used to fit on these phones now also fits on these phones and so it's

381
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,200
Speaker 5:  going to work. Like this is the point of having a universal standard. This

382
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,870
Speaker 5:  is why the EU mandated this. Yeah. This is why we were excited about this.

383
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,520
Speaker 5:  It's like it's gonna be good for the accessories market, it's gonna be good

384
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,280
Speaker 5:  for users, but you're gonna be able to share stuff with people. You're gonna

385
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,800
Speaker 5:  be able to buy things without that. Like does this work with my

386
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,740
Speaker 5:  phone question? Which is a really complicated question

387
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,570
Speaker 5:  for lots of people. Yep. And yeah, the fact that Apple seems to have gone

388
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,510
Speaker 5:  about this about the most open way possible is great and frankly

389
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,320
Speaker 5:  very surprising.

390
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And they didn't Nerf any of the charging speeds or transfer speeds.

391
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean except the F 15 is at USC two but Well

392
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah that's, but again that's like it's good enough for most people. It'll

393
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,560
Speaker 5:  be fine. I don't think there are that many people buying an iPhone 15 desperate

394
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,760
Speaker 5:  for ultra fast. Yeah. Data transfers piece.

395
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,120
Speaker 6:  I think those people are getting a pro if they care enough, if they know

396
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,640
Speaker 6:  what USB two is, they're getting a pro. Yeah,

397
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,880
Speaker 5:  I think that's right. We should by

398
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,860
Speaker 4:  The way, the word pro means. I just wanna be clear, my contribution to

399
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,720
Speaker 4:  iPhone reviews this year is gonna be just a little weirder. 'cause I have

400
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,640
Speaker 4:  the code conference to deal with that's very distracting. But I'm

401
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,100
Speaker 4:  like, what if my only contribution to this review is

402
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,900
Speaker 4:  2000 words on the meaning of the word pro. A word that has lost

403
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,370
Speaker 4:  all meaning in which in this case for Apple this year

404
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,320
Speaker 4:  means good at video games. That's what pros. They don't have another, they

405
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,230
Speaker 4:  don't have another answer for it. Which is wild.

406
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,200
Speaker 5:  Okay. I see it exactly the opposite. We should get to

407
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,880
Speaker 5:  Google after this. Yeah. 'cause this is enough Apple talk. But I think to

408
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,780
Speaker 5:  me the fact that a big part of the way Apple showed off the pro was

409
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,720
Speaker 5:  by showing you how you can like rig up a camera in a studio and shoot

410
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,460
Speaker 5:  to external storage. Like that's Yeah, that's pro,

411
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,260
Speaker 5:  that's how you tell a story that is different about that phone than

412
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,900
Speaker 5:  the other phones. Whether that's like real and how people will do that. Like

413
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,100
Speaker 5:  you were on the show on Wednesday making fun of the idea that you would like

414
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,860
Speaker 5:  use your iPhone in a studio to take professional pictures. People do that

415
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,200
Speaker 5:  all the time. Yeah dude. Like that's like life now. Stephen Soderberg iss

416
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,040
Speaker 5:  out here just like shooting movies on his iPhone for fun all day. Like it's

417
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,980
Speaker 5:  a real thing. And the idea that they're gonna take the

418
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,960
Speaker 5:  pro and like give it genuinely new things to do, especially as

419
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,760
Speaker 5:  a camera. I think like if you want to tell a pro story, that's where you

420
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,240
Speaker 5:  do it. They're like, we are gonna turn this thing. Right. And

421
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,750
Speaker 4:  I'm saying what they're saying is look at how good it is at video games.

422
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,830
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Not that thing

423
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,720
Speaker 5:  Sort of, I mean they did a little bit of the other story. They spent way

424
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,920
Speaker 5:  too much time talking about games. This is like Apple does this all the time

425
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,240
Speaker 5:  where they're like, they're, this is, we made a phone. This is my

426
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,150
Speaker 6:  Favorite thing in the world. Yeah,

427
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,160
Speaker 5:  It's, you're going to use it for games occasionally. So we're gonna tell

428
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,260
Speaker 5:  you about every single game that exists on the iPhone. So

429
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,160
Speaker 4:  Two things and Then we can wrap up as always. I've asked people to email

430
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,680
Speaker 4:  us with their hardcore Android gamers. So. we got one from

431
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,600
Speaker 4:  Evan. He said, I am here to inform you that I've been gaming on Android for

432
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,800
Speaker 4:  as long as The Verge has existed. And it's a long list of all the phones

433
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,430
Speaker 4:  you've ever got. Lg, Optimus G. He played Need for speed on it.

434
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,280
Speaker 4:  Wait, LT Launch. She's got Stadia. Anyway, this email ends with, I

435
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,600
Speaker 4:  did just buy an iPhone 11 primarily to play games.

436
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,540
Speaker 5:  There it is. There it is.

437
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,480
Speaker 4:  Yep. It's well done Evan. Easily the funniest turn. It's a, it's a good long

438
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,640
Speaker 4:  email. Easily one of the funniest turns in an email saying you're wrong about

439
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,080
Speaker 4:  Android games. It was a very good, we've

440
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Speaker 6:  Email

441
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,120
Speaker 4:  And Then, we got an email from Colin 'cause we were

442
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,080
Speaker 4:  wondering who would buy the Lightning to USB C Dongle for 20

443
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,860
Speaker 4:  bucks. And we hypothesized that some people would buy them for their cars

444
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,720
Speaker 4:  and he emailed us to tell us Yes, his friend is buying one for his car. He

445
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,560
Speaker 4:  has a custom setup and he, it's apparently easier to pay

446
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,480
Speaker 4:  20 bucks for the dongle than to tear open his car and put in

447
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,700
Speaker 4:  a USB c cable custom

448
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,000
Speaker 6:  Set up with a built-in U

449
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,840
Speaker 4:  Lightning cable. Yeah. That's

450
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,640
Speaker 6:  Incredible.

451
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,520
Speaker 4:  I love this stuff. He's probably one of these people with like an iPad in

452
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,680
Speaker 4:  the center of the the car. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well Colin, we want pictures

453
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,640
Speaker 4:  of your friend's car. So get in there, send it. But there are some

454
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,280
Speaker 4:  people out there who are buying the dongle. 'cause they have basically fixed

455
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,000
Speaker 4:  Lightning cables.

456
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,640
Speaker 6:  A lot of like coffee shops are gonna buy the dongle. I

457
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,260
Speaker 5:  Also think a lot of people are gonna buy the dongle because the idea of buying

458
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,240
Speaker 5:  an entirely new cable feels annoying. And I'm gonna spend a lot of

459
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,960
Speaker 5:  time like running around to relatives being like, don't buy the Don, go buy

460
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,840
Speaker 5:  a new cable. It costs, it's the same price, it's gonna be

461
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,520
Speaker 5:  fine. Everything's okay. Like I'm, I'm gonna end up with just like

462
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,270
Speaker 5:  a giant You know bucket full of two meter

463
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:23,020
Speaker 5:  long USB C cables. And just every time I go into a room with family members,

464
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,200
Speaker 5:  I'm just gonna start hucking them at people. Yeah. That's my, everybody's

465
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,520
Speaker 6:  Gonna little rat tail on the, on the bottom of their phones. Exactly. Because

466
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,000
Speaker 6:  they always have to have that, that dongle.

467
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,240
Speaker 4:  This Hong Kong, like people did it with the headphones. And lastly, I'm just

468
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,080
Speaker 4:  gonna say this, I have heard that not everyone at Apple

469
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,990
Speaker 4:  pronounce it's Heath. Whoa. That Hef.

470
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,140
Speaker 4:  There's more diversity of pronunciations inside

471
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,950
Speaker 4:  of Apple in Tell me more.

472
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,920
Speaker 4:  Well, I was just like, does this whole company call it Heath? And then some

473
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,730
Speaker 4:  people contacted me and was like, not all of us say

474
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,350
Speaker 4:  Heath,

475
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,270
Speaker 6:  You can't, you can't share, like you don't wanna disclose your short sources.

476
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,610
Speaker 4:  No, this is, this is some of the most sensitive reporting I've ever done.

477
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:01,790
Speaker 4:  I,

478
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,110
Speaker 6:  We appreciate it.

479
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,970
Speaker 4:  And I'm just saying he f might've been pushed out into

480
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:07,630
Speaker 4:  the world,

481
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,350
Speaker 5:  But it's out there now. If you're the one on ca, if you're the one on camera,

482
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,290
Speaker 5:  you get to decide how it's pronounced and

483
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:12,970
Speaker 4:  And it's Heath. It's

484
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,470
Speaker 5:  Heif now.

485
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,850
Speaker 4:  All right. We gotta take a break. That is enough iPhone stuff for a

486
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,370
Speaker 4:  week. We'll be back with Addie Robertson to talk about us. If you Google,

487
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,450
Speaker 4:  which is a big deal, we'll be right

488
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,950
Speaker 4:  back.

489
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,570
Speaker 5:  couple weeks and there's tons of people talking about that. There was the

490
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:50,450
Speaker 5:  Microsoft Activision Blizzard trial, there was the Elizabeth Holmes trial.

491
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,330
Speaker 5:  Like we've had a run of these very high profile

492
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:52,860
Speaker 4:  Cases. Apple, Samsung,

493
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,930
Speaker 5:  Apple V Samsung. We've had a run of these over the last few years and this

494
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:59,870
Speaker 5:  feels by far like the one that is getting

495
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,890
Speaker 5:  the least attention despite being potentially like the most

496
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,450
Speaker 5:  consequential by a million miles. Yeah, it's very strange. I think

497
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,570
Speaker 6:  It's because Google's just really good at like flying under the radar. 'cause

498
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,450
Speaker 6:  even with the, the Google v Epic. No,

499
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,690
Speaker 4:  That's what I meant. I said Apple v, Samsung and then,

500
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,250
Speaker 5:  I mean that one happened too. I mean Apple

501
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:16,530
Speaker 4:  V

502
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,370
Speaker 6:  Epic, like they all happen, right? Like Apple v Epic was a big

503
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,290
Speaker 6:  deal. Yeah, Google v Epic. We were like, yep, now they're doing it. I

504
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:24,670
Speaker 6:  mean Google

505
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:28,450
Speaker 9:  Has also been trying to keep like as much of the trial under wraps

506
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,800
Speaker 9:  as possible here. Yeah,

507
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,190
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So just

508
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,480
Speaker 6:  Unlike their phones,

509
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,370
Speaker 4:  It's very good. So just to lay that stage here, then I want to add, to talk

510
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:41,610
Speaker 4:  about what's actually happening in trial. It is impossible to cover this

511
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,860
Speaker 4:  trial. There's no audio stream of it.

512
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,680
Speaker 9:  There was an audio stream very briefly

513
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,470
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Of of just the opening arguments, but none of the witnesses, there's

514
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:54,370
Speaker 4:  barely a schedule. If reporters go into the courtroom, they can't have

515
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,220
Speaker 4:  devices, they have to take all their notes longhand. It is just

516
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,130
Speaker 4:  ridiculous. Yeah. But the government might get to a

517
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,970
Speaker 4:  place where it breaks up Google and the process by which that is

518
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,430
Speaker 4:  happening is basically impossible and

519
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:13,370
Speaker 4:  opaque because we cannot just cover it unless we send

520
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,850
Speaker 4:  someone to the courtroom every day for nine weeks to take notes with a

521
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,370
Speaker 4:  pen and a scroll, which we are thinking about doing and

522
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,220
Speaker 4:  obviously other other larger competitors like Bloomberg and the Times are

523
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,410
Speaker 4:  doing. But you just contrast that with all of the other

524
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:31,280
Speaker 4:  trials and it, for some reason these decisions have been

525
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,760
Speaker 4:  made. It's, I dunno, it's, I find it very frustrating

526
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,450
Speaker 4:  obviously because I think about Google all day every day. But this is the

527
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,400
Speaker 4:  trial where You know Google putting out memos to its own employees saying

528
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,070
Speaker 4:  we do not use words like Lockin.

529
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,400
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Or scale. Or

530
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,030
Speaker 4:  Scale. Yeah. Right. We don't use the word leverage when we talk about search.

531
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,600
Speaker 4:  Like they're instructing their own executives how to email each other.

532
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,270
Speaker 4:  They're in trouble for destroying evidence in this case.

533
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:58,790
Speaker 5:  Yeah. There's that amazing message where Sundar, Petra, the c e o popped

534
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,360
Speaker 5:  into a a Google chat group and said something to the effect of

535
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,830
Speaker 5:  like, we should talk about this. Can we turn off

536
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,620
Speaker 5:  history for this chat session? And then that's obviously

537
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,420
Speaker 5:  the last message anyone can see. And yeah, I mean Addie,

538
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,680
Speaker 5:  my impression, and this is based on very little except just thinking about

539
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,440
Speaker 5:  incentives here, is that Google has everything to gain

540
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,770
Speaker 5:  from burying as much of this trial and process as possible,

541
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,580
Speaker 5:  right?

542
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,400
Speaker 9:  Yes. I mean with the caveat that it's not going to matter if the, A

543
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,200
Speaker 9:  judge is like, we're breaking up Google. Google is still getting broken up

544
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,120
Speaker 9:  even if it's in secret. And again, to be clear, that's one of

545
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,920
Speaker 9:  the less likely outcomes. Yes. But yeah, I think that it benefits

546
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,680
Speaker 9:  Google to not have to deal with a lot of the

547
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,410
Speaker 9:  arguments being made here as it does it would for really most

548
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,340
Speaker 9:  plaintiffs, like as it would for Apple in Epic versus Apple.

549
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,000
Speaker 9:  And then there's also a lot of other companies implicated here. Like obviously

550
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,960
Speaker 9:  this is about, Google's deals with companies like Apple. And so

551
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,880
Speaker 9:  Apple has appeared and tried to like, it's tried to get its

552
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,600
Speaker 9:  executives out of testifying. So there's really

553
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,800
Speaker 9:  just a lot of companies here and a lot of very sensitive information going

554
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,680
Speaker 9:  around. And so on one hand it's, it's not really surprising that they would

555
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,360
Speaker 9:  try to keep a lot of this secret. But on the other, it also means that you

556
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,960
Speaker 9:  don't hear as much about what the Justice Department is saying Google is

557
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,510
Speaker 9:  doing.

558
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,410
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And the case fundamentally turns on on these deals.

559
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:27,400
Speaker 4:  Right. So the case was pretty wide ranging. It's been, this has been

560
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,720
Speaker 4:  going on for three years now. Yeah.

561
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,020
Speaker 5:  It was 2020 the first suit was filed. Yeah.

562
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,960
Speaker 4:  And so it's like all things, as it approaches trial, it's

563
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,680
Speaker 4:  been narrowed down to a handful of issues. The most I think

564
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,500
Speaker 4:  important and relevant. One is Google's deals to be the default search engine

565
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,440
Speaker 4:  on the iPhone and other platforms. So of course the Justice Department

566
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,300
Speaker 4:  wants Tim Cook to testify and Apple's like, no,

567
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,800
Speaker 4:  no, no, no, no, we're not doing. And, but that makes sense. They wanna do

568
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,440
Speaker 4:  that. But just again, I'm just coming back to this last, this

569
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,080
Speaker 4:  week while Apple was announcing pretty light refreshes the

570
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,250
Speaker 4:  iPhone that captured all the attention, but the

571
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:08,220
Speaker 4:  trial in which the Department of Justice is saying, the deal in which

572
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,720
Speaker 4:  Google pays Apple money to be the default search provider on the

573
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,540
Speaker 4:  iPhone is anti-competitive and illegal

574
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,400
Speaker 4:  is like totally under the radar and impossible to cover. And I just think

575
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,240
Speaker 4:  that's weird.

576
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,320
Speaker 9:  I think there's also, it's also just easy to be sort of cynical because we've

577
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,040
Speaker 9:  been seeing these cases try to make a dent in companies for

578
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,180
Speaker 9:  years and years and years. Like the, there was this

579
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,510
Speaker 9:  entire gigantic, ostensibly bipartisan tech

580
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,360
Speaker 9:  lash starting in really about 2016, building up

581
00:32:36,444 --> 00:32:40,400
Speaker 9:  20 17, 20 18 and nothing happened. Yeah. I just, I think it's really

582
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,120
Speaker 9:  easy to look at this and go, it is very, very hard to win an

583
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,960
Speaker 9:  antitrust case. The Federal Trade Commission, which is not

584
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Speaker 9:  the one bringing the suit, but is, which is part of the Biden administration's

585
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,800
Speaker 9:  attempt to get antitrust to happen in the us It has had a couple of

586
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,260
Speaker 9:  really high profile losses. Epic versus Apple.

587
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,040
Speaker 9:  Really it means that Apple is going to maybe have to do

588
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,720
Speaker 9:  something that Apple has been fighting tooth and nail to not do, but it's

589
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,200
Speaker 9:  still basically determined, look, apple can just charge these fees. I think

590
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,320
Speaker 9:  that it's very easy to look at this and worry that just nothing's going to

591
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,350
Speaker 9:  come of it. Yeah.

592
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,180
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I I like that. That was what I was gonna say. I think, I think cynicism

593
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,040
Speaker 6:  is, is the right word here. People are cynical. Like we've seen this

594
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,620
Speaker 6:  happen so many times

595
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,760
Speaker 6:  and not just in tech. You've seen it happen in a lot of places where it's

596
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,960
Speaker 6:  just like, okay, so when is the government gonna actually do something? When

597
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,920
Speaker 6:  is this gonna happen? We're just gonna continue on. And this is like

598
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,720
Speaker 6:  a really good opportunity for the government. And even the government seems

599
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,430
Speaker 6:  like reluctant, right? Like they could probably make this a lot more public.

600
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,440
Speaker 6:  They could make this more of a show. Well, and it might be in their best

601
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,300
Speaker 6:  interest to like get the public support behind it,

602
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,440
Speaker 6:  but they, even the government is playing it so safe. You're like, well, you're

603
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,970
Speaker 6:  playing it that safe. Are you really gonna do it? Well,

604
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,800
Speaker 4:  There are many branches of government three, I'm told there's

605
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,680
Speaker 4:  three. So You know, I don't know why the judge, in this

606
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,570
Speaker 4:  case, judge Meta is logging it down the way he is. Obviously Google

607
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,420
Speaker 4:  wants it that way and there's requests and there's private stuff, but like

608
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,720
Speaker 4:  not having audio streams of the witnesses seems, I don't, I I just don't

609
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,400
Speaker 4:  understand that at all. And then there's the D O J, which is You know they're

610
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,230
Speaker 4:  prosecutors. They're not supposed to do it that way.

611
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,100
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But Right. You know. It's like I, there's a little bit of a gap there.

612
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,760
Speaker 4:  The thing I would give you is the same week we did

613
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,160
Speaker 4:  watch the European government successfully pressure Apple into changing the

614
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,940
Speaker 4:  port in the iPhone. And that's a good outcome. And even

615
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,640
Speaker 4:  in our videos, like our hands-on video where we are like Apple

616
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,880
Speaker 4:  changed it, the comments are like the Europeans changed it. Yep. Yeah. Like

617
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,540
Speaker 4:  people understand the mechanism by which the change was made.

618
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,720
Speaker 5:  Yes. Well, and that's what we've been talking about in the US for the last

619
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,000
Speaker 5:  couple of years, right? Is that like a, a clearer part of the ftc, which

620
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,480
Speaker 5:  again is not involved in this particular trial, but what they're trying to

621
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,320
Speaker 5:  do is sort of lose in such a way that it eventually we have to

622
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,310
Speaker 5:  legislate answers to this. And it's like what the EU did was make laws Yeah.

623
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,560
Speaker 5:  They like, there was no big court case about the Lightning port. They just

624
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,740
Speaker 5:  made a law about common chargers. And it feels like

625
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,640
Speaker 5:  that's, if our, if our system worked better, it's, it

626
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,310
Speaker 5:  might be different

627
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,920
Speaker 4:  Here, but so the EU has made a lot of laws, so many about Google search,

628
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,990
Speaker 5:  Many, so many,

629
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,540
Speaker 4:  They have done more aggressive enforcements about Google

630
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,360
Speaker 4:  search than would ever be contemplated in this

631
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,040
Speaker 4:  company. Yes. Down to designing the startup flow of an

632
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,640
Speaker 4:  Android phone. And Addie and I have been talking about this for years. None

633
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,520
Speaker 4:  of it has worked. Like Google is dominant in Europe, when you open an Android

634
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,800
Speaker 4:  phone, it asks you if you wanna use Chrome. It asks you, it has a browser

635
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,520
Speaker 4:  ballot and a search engine ballot. Right. And no,

636
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,110
Speaker 4:  everyone's just like, okay, like we're gonna pick Chrome and Google

637
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,020
Speaker 4:  because I bought a Android phone. Like, what else do you think

638
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,730
Speaker 4:  I'm doing here?

639
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,660
Speaker 9:  DuckDuckGo?

640
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:49,880
Speaker 5:  How

641
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,350
Speaker 4:  Did you see any similarities between that

642
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,720
Speaker 4:  version of the European enforcement, which has been

643
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,440
Speaker 4:  unsuccessful and what is happening in this case?

644
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,070
Speaker 9:  I mean, that entire thing you've just said is kind of Google's argument is,

645
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,960
Speaker 9:  look, even when we don't, don't get the default placement, even when we

646
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,620
Speaker 9:  don't do this thing that the Justice Department is saying is illegal, we

647
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,480
Speaker 9:  win. So clearly we're just the

648
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,040
Speaker 9:  best.

649
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,680
Speaker 5:  I just wanna say that is my absolute favorite thing that has been happening

650
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,440
Speaker 5:  in this trial so far is binging is everybody's punching

651
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,940
Speaker 5:  bag.

652
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,460
Speaker 10:  And

653
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,280
Speaker 5:  But like Google's argument is essentially Microsoft makes

654
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,320
Speaker 5:  binging the default on Windows in the same way. That word the default in

655
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,160
Speaker 5:  lots of places. And still overwhelmingly people choose Google because Bing

656
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,740
Speaker 5:  sucks. And the government's case is, well, binging sucks and

657
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,980
Speaker 5:  nobody uses it. And that's Google's fault.

658
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,270
Speaker 10:  And and

659
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:46,040
Speaker 5:  It's very funny to me that like it's, it's a shame that there's not a better

660
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,000
Speaker 5:  product to argue about here. Yeah. And I think it just

661
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,500
Speaker 5:  kept coming up over and over and over. And like in a funny

662
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,160
Speaker 5:  way, if Google wins this case, I think Microsoft is going to have

663
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,060
Speaker 5:  been a huge ally for Google in winning this case. Because what Google

664
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,020
Speaker 5:  is saying, and Addie, I don't know if this was your impression, but listening

665
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,360
Speaker 5:  to the opening arguments over an at t conference call, which was very funny

666
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,300
Speaker 5:  for an antitrust trial, which is, but

667
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,160
Speaker 5:  it, the overwhelming thing Google kept saying was like, we are not the

668
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,400
Speaker 5:  company with infinite resources that is able to do whatever we want and outbid

669
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,240
Speaker 5:  everybody to do everything because Microsoft exists. Microsoft is also a

670
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,800
Speaker 5:  trillion dollar company with limitless money to do whatever it wants. They

671
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,540
Speaker 5:  keep trying to put binging in front of people. Windows exists. Microsoft

672
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,280
Speaker 5:  has a long history of doing antitrust things and binging still sucks and

673
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,080
Speaker 5:  nobody uses it. And I actually think like of all of the Google arguments

674
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,440
Speaker 5:  I have heard so far, that is by far the most compelling to me. I don't know,

675
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,940
Speaker 5:  Addie, did you read that differently on the first day? Yeah.

676
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,440
Speaker 9:  And I think that the Justice Department is trying to counter it by basically

677
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,030
Speaker 9:  saying the reason Google is so good and is so untouchable is

678
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,520
Speaker 9:  because we all agree here, Bing, it

679
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,150
Speaker 9:  sucks.

680
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,640
Speaker 10:  They're,

681
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,940
Speaker 9:  They're not that strong,

682
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,060
Speaker 10:  But they

683
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,910
Speaker 9:  Is that Google gathers has so much data from searches

684
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,840
Speaker 9:  that it basically got this flywheel effect of just being able to get

685
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,300
Speaker 9:  to fault placements. So then people type things into Google and then Google

686
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,080
Speaker 9:  learns how people search for things and then Google could deliver better

687
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,920
Speaker 9:  results. And then this just keeps going. And even though Microsoft has

688
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,350
Speaker 9:  tried to do things, it's tried to set its own defaults, it has

689
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:21,140
Speaker 9:  partnered with Yahoo at thing that's come up to do a data sharing deal

690
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,110
Speaker 9:  in order to get more queries, that that just hasn't been enough.

691
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:27,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. One of the things that Judge Meta asked, I think like

692
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,660
Speaker 5:  within the first hour or so of testimony on the first day

693
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,160
Speaker 5:  was he asked the, the D o j lawyer, how long has

694
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,900
Speaker 5:  Google been a monopoly? Which I thought was a really interesting question.

695
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,720
Speaker 5:  And, and I think the answer was it has been illegally protecting that

696
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,640
Speaker 5:  monopoly since 2010, which, which assumes that it was a monopoly

697
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,240
Speaker 5:  before that. Right. But I think once,

698
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,120
Speaker 9:  I think he was saying it's been, it's had really heavy market power since

699
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,670
Speaker 9:  about 2007. Okay.

700
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So I

701
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,000
Speaker 9:  Think, and then yes, it's been illegally maintaining the monopolies since

702
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,450
Speaker 9:  2010.

703
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,160
Speaker 5:  Right. And so that's, that's the do j's argument. But what I think is really

704
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,040
Speaker 5:  interesting there is like, obviously Google came out in 1998 and no

705
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,800
Speaker 5:  one is debating the fact that Google, at least for a long time was vastly

706
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,600
Speaker 5:  better than everything else and won purely on the merits. And then what

707
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,460
Speaker 5:  we're debating now is did it go from winning on the merits

708
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,280
Speaker 5:  to buying merits and essentially making it

709
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,960
Speaker 5:  impossible for anyone else to do to like Google what Google did

710
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,950
Speaker 5:  to Alta Vista and everybody else 25 years ago. And

711
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,840
Speaker 5:  that turn and trying to figure out like where it happened and what it looks

712
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,240
Speaker 5:  like is I think why we've come down to these default deals. Because ultimately

713
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,000
Speaker 5:  that's the question, right? Is like Google's out here saying there are a

714
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,840
Speaker 5:  million ways to find information on the internet and the D O J is saying

715
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,600
Speaker 5:  like general search, which they keep calling it is this different thing from

716
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,520
Speaker 5:  what TikTok is and what chat G P T is. But they have to figure out

717
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,320
Speaker 5:  like, okay, when did Google go from just objectively being the best search

718
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,170
Speaker 5:  engine? And so everybody uses it, which is not illegal to

719
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,880
Speaker 5:  being the best and making sure that no one else can be, which is a much

720
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,360
Speaker 5:  trickier thing than like what Microsoft did, which is just like boot Netscape

721
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,280
Speaker 5:  off the internet. And I don't know, it's, it just set us off down this kind

722
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,960
Speaker 5:  of odd path where like it's almost not obvious what everyone is

723
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,600
Speaker 5:  arguing at any given time, right? No matter what side you're

724
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,550
Speaker 4:  On. This general search thing is ridiculous.

725
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,540
Speaker 4:  Like the F T C what, what, they've done a bad

726
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,440
Speaker 4:  job in many of their cases. Like they did the entire Activision trial

727
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,320
Speaker 4:  and forgot to mention cloud gaming and then they lost and then they were

728
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,280
Speaker 4:  like in the background being like, we're gonna appeal on cloud gaming. And

729
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,180
Speaker 4:  it's like, yeah, that was the, that was the argument

730
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,840
Speaker 4:  the whole time here. The d oj I think is getting suckered into

731
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,780
Speaker 4:  this ar like every antitrust trial comes down to like, what is the market?

732
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,400
Speaker 4:  Yep. Let's have an increasingly esoteric debate about what

733
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,800
Speaker 4:  market is being dominated. And then obviously Google's like the

734
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,200
Speaker 4:  market is the use of computers and we are, but one

735
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,960
Speaker 4:  tiny fraction of why one might compute, sir. Right? Right. And then the D

736
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,800
Speaker 4:  O J is like general search, which means fucking nothing. And the answer is

737
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,040
Speaker 4:  like, no, it's searching the web. Yeah. There are a handful of products that

738
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,800
Speaker 4:  search the web. Yep. People use them all day long and

739
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,860
Speaker 4:  there's one search engine that matters in the web.

740
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,480
Speaker 9:  Yes. To be fair, that is what their definition of general search is, is a

741
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,160
Speaker 9:  thing that searches sources that is not sources beyond one

742
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,660
Speaker 9:  site on the web. Right. Right.

743
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:20,540
Speaker 4:  But that even that definition is like, it, it just, it's so not

744
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:24,400
Speaker 4:  the, like if you tried to explain that to a normal person, you'd be like,

745
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,190
Speaker 4:  all right, so there's, there are sources beyond one site, right? Like you,

746
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:32,120
Speaker 4:  like, I'm not even gonna say the word web to you. And it I I would

747
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,050
Speaker 4:  just say if you, you just look at the web today, we've talked about this

748
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:38,600
Speaker 4:  so many times. It is so obviously influenced by Google's wants and

749
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,480
Speaker 4:  needs that you can't not say this thing is

750
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,460
Speaker 4:  dominant. It is the only incentive structure that exists in the web really

751
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,080
Speaker 4:  is Google's wants and needs. 'cause that's how people get traffic to the

752
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,970
Speaker 4:  websites. Okay. Like just start. And the

753
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,490
Speaker 4:  D O J has just been suckered into this conversation about general search

754
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,310
Speaker 4:  and whether the kids are using TikTok. Right.

755
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,250
Speaker 6:  And like that's totally different.

756
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,630
Speaker 4:  I mean if Apple changes the default search on the iPhone to be

757
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,970
Speaker 4:  TikTok

758
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,170
Speaker 6:  Horrible experience.

759
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:11,050
Speaker 4:  Right. And it's like, but that's so just generally nonsensical to think of

760
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:14,760
Speaker 4:  that. Yeah. The kids love iPhones, the kids love TikTok,

761
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,890
Speaker 4:  mung 'em together, all these other searches that we're talking about in the

762
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:20,970
Speaker 4:  category of general search that Google wants you to consider. I would just

763
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:24,650
Speaker 4:  say, come back to the thing at issue, which is the default deals on

764
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,330
Speaker 4:  these platforms and say, can you replace them? Could you

765
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,920
Speaker 4:  replace the default search on the iPhone with a YouTube search?

766
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,290
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And like no, basically you need web

767
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:39,090
Speaker 4:  search and I Google's protection of that web search. Well

768
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,890
Speaker 4:  yeah, there's the data argument that they've been making for a long time.

769
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,530
Speaker 4:  Like everyone's been making, Google has the most data they can do it, but

770
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:48,410
Speaker 4:  next to it Addie are these like vertical search engines like Yelp and

771
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,040
Speaker 4:  these other companies that are like, we're much better in these very specific

772
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,890
Speaker 4:  domains and we can barely even get to a customer because of

773
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,880
Speaker 4:  Google's deals. Yeah,

774
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,690
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Which was a bigger part of the case originally and then got trimmed

775
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,690
Speaker 9:  out of it. And so is not coming up in this as much. Do

776
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,990
Speaker 6:  You think it'll come up later in these 10 weeks?

777
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:11,770
Speaker 9:  So the Department of Justice is making its case first, and that

778
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:15,670
Speaker 9:  claim was part of the state attorney general suit that's gonna come up later,

779
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,890
Speaker 9:  but it also got cut mostly from that suit. So I think we're not actually

780
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,330
Speaker 9:  going to hear nearly as much about it as we could have even though those

781
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,450
Speaker 9:  search engines come up. Which

782
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:27,320
Speaker 6:  Is a bummer because that feels like the real issue, right?

783
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,750
Speaker 6:  Like the fact that they're doing these exclusivity deals is on

784
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:34,610
Speaker 6:  its face totally a like monopoly behavior. But also

785
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:38,190
Speaker 6:  in this case, Google is actually really good at search. So of course like

786
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:38,490
Speaker 6:  it makes

787
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,070
Speaker 4:  Sense. Well no, it's like, let's say you ask Siri to find

788
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:45,690
Speaker 4:  you a plumber. Yeah, right. In

789
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,670
Speaker 4:  a competitive world, apple goes and makes a deal with Yelp

790
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:49,890
Speaker 4:  or

791
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:50,990
Speaker 6:  AngelList. AngelList

792
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:54,090
Speaker 4:  Or whatever, right. And they're running that search on a specialized

793
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:57,770
Speaker 4:  service. Google's deal means like that's all going through Google. Oh,

794
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:58,240
Speaker 4:  okay.

795
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,010
Speaker 6:  Okay then. Yeah. No, they're a monopoly. Let's get rid of

796
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,130
Speaker 4:  'em. I mean like I don't dunno if that's good or bad, bad. Well it's also

797
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,890
Speaker 4:  right, I'm just saying but that's, that's sort of the, the shape of it and

798
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,290
Speaker 4:  Addie's, right? It's been trimmed outta the suit although, well

799
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:08,970
Speaker 6:  No, this part that

800
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,570
Speaker 9:  Got trimmed outta the suit was not the thing you're describing. It was the

801
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:14,730
Speaker 9:  idea that when you go to Google itself Yeah, yeah. And you're trying to find

802
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:18,170
Speaker 9:  a thing on Google. Google makes it hard to find these places like Yelp

803
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:21,130
Speaker 9:  or TripAdvisor or whatever through Google

804
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:24,190
Speaker 9:  specifically. So that got mostly cut out of the suit

805
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,410
Speaker 4:  And the judge sort of rightfully was like, well, Google's allowed to do whatever

806
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,400
Speaker 4:  it wants on Google. But there is that vertical search thing from what

807
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,120
Speaker 4:  I read of the decision, the judge is basically like, I need to see more evidence,

808
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,840
Speaker 4:  we'll get more evidence at trial and I will decide how big of a deal that

809
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,680
Speaker 4:  is. And so we'll see what hap what the states do. But you just look at all

810
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,640
Speaker 4:  of the things Google does and again, it's instructions to

811
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,520
Speaker 4:  its own people to not talk about doing those

812
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,820
Speaker 4:  things.

813
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,660
Speaker 9:  Ooh. That seems illegal. I mean I don't think that it is necessarily illegal,

814
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,440
Speaker 9:  but it is de certainly the kind of thing you can bring up to, to say it's

815
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,480
Speaker 9:  shady. Yeah.

816
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,120
Speaker 4:  I mean that we don't, we don't leverage anything. It is like a very funny

817
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,520
Speaker 4:  thing to say. So Addie, what's been going on this week? It's just been Google's

818
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,880
Speaker 4:  chief economist, Hal Vian, have we learned anything in

819
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,540
Speaker 4:  particular?

820
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,330
Speaker 9:  So the first day was after opening statements, Hal Vian who,

821
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:16,280
Speaker 9:  where they really honed in on the idea that we're gonna go to the

822
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,520
Speaker 9:  metaphorical tape and look at all of these emails that Google execs have

823
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,280
Speaker 9:  sent about how important scale is and how important data is. And

824
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,200
Speaker 9:  then there are these internal arguments where

825
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,920
Speaker 9:  Arian wrote this, did this interview with cnet, where he says, look,

826
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,840
Speaker 9:  the argument that that data is like the be all and end all and that

827
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,280
Speaker 9:  Microsoft has to make this deal with Yahoo to get data that's bogus. And

828
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,000
Speaker 9:  then there was this internal fight where people were just saying, look, that's

829
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,310
Speaker 9:  ridiculous. No data. Obviously if they had the data we did, we would be in,

830
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,660
Speaker 9:  they would be incredible. Like they would be much better than they are

831
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,520
Speaker 9:  now. So there's that. And then this was also where we got a lot of

832
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,970
Speaker 9:  the we at Google, we do not say market share, we say query

833
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,720
Speaker 9:  share. We do not bundle, we do not tie. And then beyond that,

834
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,640
Speaker 9:  we've also, there's been a behavioral economist that they've brought that

835
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,200
Speaker 9:  the Department of Justice has brought up to emphasize the quote sort of power

836
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,920
Speaker 9:  of defaults that that's been their first expert witness. He spent a bunch

837
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,440
Speaker 9:  of time on the stand. And so that's

838
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,320
Speaker 9:  been a lot of presentations both about stuff Google has said

839
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,870
Speaker 9:  internally, which echoes sort of the varying testimony and just

840
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:24,600
Speaker 9:  experiments and other data that has been collected

841
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,830
Speaker 9:  elsewhere. That just says in general, people choose defaults.

842
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,820
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I do think if you wanted to boil this case all the way down to

843
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:35,440
Speaker 5:  one question, it's the power of defaults. Like do defaults

844
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,160
Speaker 5:  matter is in a big way, it seems like what a lot of this is going to

845
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,840
Speaker 5:  hinge on, because Google's argument is they

846
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,420
Speaker 5:  matter a little, right? It's why we pay for the defaults. Like Google cannot,

847
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,280
Speaker 5:  in any kind of reasonable way, say defaults don't matter at all

848
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,200
Speaker 5:  because it pays tens of billions of dollars a year. Yeah. To be the

849
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,360
Speaker 5:  default. So it's, it's like all that is fine and good, but the two arguments

850
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,870
Speaker 5:  it makes is that defaults don't matter that much because people choose Google

851
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:04,100
Speaker 5:  even when it's hard to, or even when there is a fairly level playing field.

852
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,840
Speaker 5:  And because binging sucks, because binging sucks. And also that we

853
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,280
Speaker 5:  only pay to be the default because we're the good, we're the best product.

854
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,980
Speaker 5:  Everybody tells us we're the best product. That's the only thing that matters.

855
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,920
Speaker 5:  The end there. And then the D O J is out here saying, no, you are the

856
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,800
Speaker 5:  default you pay to be the default So, we can't even reasonably start to

857
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,680
Speaker 5:  answer the rest of these questions. Right. And that's what all the like little

858
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,640
Speaker 5:  search engines will tell you. That's what all the failed competitors will

859
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,700
Speaker 5:  tell you is that like, we don't even know if we could have beaten Google

860
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,480
Speaker 5:  or tried or caught up. We just, there's no runway, there's no way to

861
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,240
Speaker 5:  even get into this space. Right.

862
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,720
Speaker 4:  You just wrote the obituary of Neva

863
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,280
Speaker 5:  Basically. Yeah. And Neva has already come up a bunch in this trial. And

864
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,200
Speaker 5:  Sridhar Ram Swami, the c e O of Neva who used to run the whole ad business

865
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,160
Speaker 5:  at Google is going to take the stand during this trial. Like that is a

866
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,860
Speaker 5:  key part of the argument is like, defaults are so important that because

867
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,680
Speaker 5:  Google pays all this money to be the default, we don't exist. And

868
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,640
Speaker 5:  that's like if the d if the D OJ can prove that it might win. And it's

869
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,430
Speaker 5:  very hard to prove that. Yeah. It seems to me

870
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:05,080
Speaker 9:  There's also the argument that it's that specifically, it's not just small

871
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:09,040
Speaker 9:  search engines. It is Go Apple that one of the things that hasn't come up

872
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,380
Speaker 9:  really in testimony as much, but was part of the opening statements is that

873
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:16,160
Speaker 9:  Google has been basically paying Apple to not build a search

874
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,870
Speaker 9:  engine.

875
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,750
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean I, every year at wwc, apple does something

876
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,940
Speaker 4:  that hints at an interest in doing more searches.

877
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,850
Speaker 5:  Yes.

878
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:28,440
Speaker 4:  Right. And every year You know we get the new version of iOS and it's like,

879
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,920
Speaker 4:  pull down and now you can type this and this will come up automatically.

880
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,270
Speaker 4:  Or

881
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:34,300
Speaker 5:  Yeah, you can do image search and spotlight now it's like, it's right there

882
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:34,800
Speaker 5:  if you wanted

883
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,440
Speaker 4:  To do it, it's right there. Yeah. And then every year I, we get some notes

884
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,660
Speaker 4:  from some Googlers. They're like, Apple's coming from us. And it's like,

885
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:43,400
Speaker 4:  no, they're not. Right. I'm very curious. You know

886
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,290
Speaker 4:  if, if they do put Tim Cook and Eddie Q and the rest on the stand,

887
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:50,110
Speaker 9:  We're gonna get Eddie Q we're, it's far as I know not getting Tim Cook

888
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,960
Speaker 4:  Full Hawaiian shirt, Eddie Q on the stand. Right. It's the, the question

889
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,880
Speaker 4:  I would ask is, look at all this marketing about privacy, look at

890
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,640
Speaker 4:  all this marketing about not tracking you. And look at the billions of

891
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,300
Speaker 4:  dollars you take from the largest ad tracking thing that has ever existed

892
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,520
Speaker 4:  in human history. How do you score that circle beyond just taking the

893
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,310
Speaker 4:  money? 'cause I don't think Apple's ever been held to account for this.

894
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:15,280
Speaker 4:  Certainly people have tried asking and they're like, people love

895
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,260
Speaker 4:  Google. And that's the end of it. Like Google's available in

896
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,080
Speaker 4:  the app store. The app store has created more economic opportunity

897
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,320
Speaker 4:  for people than ever. And it's like, where, where did you go? Come

898
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,560
Speaker 5:  One, one place that has already kind of come up is with Mozilla.

899
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,500
Speaker 5:  And Mozilla is another company that says a lot of things about privacy in

900
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,940
Speaker 5:  the open web and believing in the internet. And also takes a lot of money

901
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,440
Speaker 5:  from Google every year to be the default search engine in Firefox.

902
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,420
Speaker 5:  And Google's case, and this has actually worked in Google's favor

903
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,350
Speaker 5:  fairly well so far it seems, is that Mozilla at one point stopped

904
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,980
Speaker 5:  using Google as its search engine provider signed a deal with Addie, was

905
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,330
Speaker 5:  it Yahoo? I think it was Yahoo.

906
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:53,000
Speaker 9:  Okay.

907
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,780
Speaker 5:  And then went back to Google for exactly that reason. Alex,

908
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,800
Speaker 5:  because that's the face everybody makes when they have to use Yahoo search.

909
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,170
Speaker 5:  And so Google is like, they had choices and they picked Google,

910
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:07,070
Speaker 9:  Hilariously, the Department of Justice's counter to this is that

911
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,300
Speaker 9:  Yahoo could have been viable, but it was so expensive to beat Google that

912
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,070
Speaker 9:  they had to lard down their service with ads that suddenly made Yahoo search

913
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,580
Speaker 9:  awful. And that's why Yahoo search was dropped.

914
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,260
Speaker 5:  It's the bing sucks argument, right? Like, are all other search engines bad

915
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:23,100
Speaker 5:  because of Google is such a weird question, but is like kind of

916
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,660
Speaker 5:  core to a lot of this case. Yeah. Like there are no other good search

917
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,200
Speaker 5:  engines. Is it because Google is great or because Google has so

918
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,120
Speaker 5:  aggressively it's both defeated everyone. It it probably is both,

919
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,640
Speaker 5:  right? Like I think the answer is probably somewhere in the middle, which

920
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,510
Speaker 5:  is why it's gonna be very hard for Google to lose this case, it seems.

921
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:40,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

922
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,330
Speaker 4:  I mean even if they do, you just have to look at Europe

923
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:48,040
Speaker 4:  where for over a decade now, the

924
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,240
Speaker 4:  princes and princesses of Europe have shaken their pitchforks at Google and

925
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,840
Speaker 4:  said, we will undo this dominance. And the people of

926
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,280
Speaker 4:  Europe have said down with the

927
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,040
Speaker 4:  king no nay good, sir. They have

928
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,380
Speaker 5:  Googled for news about that happening.

929
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,280
Speaker 4:  We shall continue Googling it. No,

930
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,120
Speaker 4:  absolutely not. French revolution, the whole thing. This

931
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,100
Speaker 4:  is, it's it's very complicated over in Europe. They're still kings,

932
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,440
Speaker 4:  I'm told. Yes. I

933
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,520
Speaker 6:  Dunno why S and princesses everywhere. Just everywhere. No one

934
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,480
Speaker 4:  Knows why my people have run away from them twice. I'm Indian

935
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,440
Speaker 4:  American. Anyway, we're gonna cover the hell outta this trial. We're gonna

936
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,880
Speaker 4:  figure out how to get into that courtroom basically every day with a series

937
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,760
Speaker 4:  of quill pens and parchment, because that's how the

938
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,650
Speaker 4:  government wants us to cover U US v Google. David,

939
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:40,280
Speaker 6:  Could you take the parchment and have it so it like goes out of

940
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,040
Speaker 6:  the room as you write? Oh,

941
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:42,380
Speaker 5:  That's fun.

942
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,280
Speaker 4:  Oh, that's good. That's good. And

943
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,480
Speaker 6:  The Addie can just be on the other side. Oh, I

944
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,460
Speaker 5:  Like that.

945
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,740
Speaker 4:  OCRing the parchment in the world.

946
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:51,160
Speaker 5:  My thing is, I'm gonna, I'm gonna bring in increasingly less technologically

947
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,480
Speaker 5:  advanced devices every day until it's okay if I

948
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,220
Speaker 4:  Come in until judge is like, fine, bring a Chromebook.

949
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,560
Speaker 5:  If I come in with like an e ink notebook that I can write on, is that electronics?

950
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,720
Speaker 5:  Like what are we doing? Are we good? If, if if I'm not touching the screen,

951
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,120
Speaker 5:  it's not drawing any power for you. A

952
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,640
Speaker 6:  Remarkable too and just be like, what? This

953
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,510
Speaker 5:  Is what I'm saying? Yeah.

954
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:08,520
Speaker 9:  Okay. So fun detail. When you go through the battle detector in the courtroom,

955
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,420
Speaker 9:  you have to take out all your cables.

956
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,660
Speaker 6:  Oh, this is, no, this

957
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,240
Speaker 9:  Not a fun place to be if you have as many cables as I do.

958
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,240
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I was like, s Neli can never go there. No, I'm

959
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,880
Speaker 4:  Not allowed in there. That's not gonna happen. We are, we're again,

960
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,140
Speaker 4:  we're covering the how this trial, there's gonna be a bunch of big witnesses

961
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,640
Speaker 4:  on the stand. We're gonna get as much coverage to you as we can. I think

962
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,600
Speaker 4:  it, it's a big deal just because no one pays

963
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,360
Speaker 4:  attention to Google search. Like we have been running the series about Google

964
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:38,120
Speaker 4:  search and what it means, and Google turning 25 all year. We'll link it in

965
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,000
Speaker 4:  the show notes. David's Neva pieces in there. Our Google Reader piece is

966
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,760
Speaker 4:  in there. We have a bunch of ss e o stories coming about the culture of S

967
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,680
Speaker 4:  E O. I think they're gonna be really good. And what has been apparent in

968
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,480
Speaker 4:  doing those stories is that Google hates it when you talk about

969
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,030
Speaker 4:  search is anything other than like water. Yep. They're like, what searches

970
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,080
Speaker 4:  just the oxygen of the internet. It's just around you at all times. It keeps

971
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,120
Speaker 4:  us all healthy. And it's like, no, this is a business, a business that you

972
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:05,030
Speaker 4:  ruthlessly protect and instruct your people to never

973
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:08,630
Speaker 4:  discuss in words that sound ruthless. And I,

974
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,500
Speaker 4:  that gap I think is what this trial, even if the government loses

975
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,400
Speaker 4:  the trial, will narrow the gap in the perception of Google

976
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,310
Speaker 4:  search is just a benign thing that happens right. In a

977
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:23,920
Speaker 4:  very, very ruthlessly run business. And I say ruthless, I don't mean that

978
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,700
Speaker 4:  in a negative way. I think Google does a good job of running

979
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,240
Speaker 4:  its business and making a lot of cash on Google search and then funding a

980
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,400
Speaker 4:  bunch of shit. It shuts down two months later. Right, right. Like that's

981
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,280
Speaker 4:  the engine of Google it. It's basically, it's only business and then a little

982
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,520
Speaker 4:  bit of YouTube and then a little bit of Google Cloud. But like it's search

983
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,480
Speaker 4:  that funds a whole bunch of stuff. Yeah.

984
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,320
Speaker 5:  And Google wants you to think about it as this like inevitable thing that

985
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,080
Speaker 5:  just sort of has to exist the way that it does in order for Yeah. The internet

986
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,420
Speaker 5:  to work like, like you're saying, it's, they want you to think it's water

987
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:55,260
Speaker 5:  and it is like a series of very specific choices that people made in

988
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,960
Speaker 5:  how this thing works. And if nothing else, we're going to learn a lot about

989
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,900
Speaker 5:  the choices. Yeah.

990
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,440
Speaker 4:  And I, and we'll do it with Quill pens and parchment if you have

991
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,560
Speaker 4:  to. Okay. We gotta take a break. Addie, stick around. We're gonna take a

992
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,640
Speaker 4:  break when we come back. I need you and Alex to explain what is going on

993
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,760
Speaker 4:  with Unity To me. We'll be right

994
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:15,630
Speaker 4:  back.

995
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:13,340
Speaker 1:  cost. With the broadest and deepest application development capabilities

996
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,380
Speaker 1:  at your fingertips,

997
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,000
Speaker 6:  reach, like, if you sell enough product, then you're gonna have to

998
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,520
Speaker 6:  start paying them for every download. Every install. Yeah, every

999
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,280
Speaker 6:  install. So Monica and Allison are just gonna bankrupt companies

1000
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,480
Speaker 6:  every time they review new products because

1001
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,370
Speaker 4:  They install the games and all these phones that they review.

1002
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:32,220
Speaker 6:  Right? So, so basically they, they've, they've walked some of it back. But

1003
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,280
Speaker 6:  if you're making, I think if you're a, a smaller developer and you're making

1004
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,600
Speaker 6:  like over 200,000 a year from your game, you're gonna have to start paying

1005
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,440
Speaker 6:  these fees. And if you're a larger developer and I think it's over a million

1006
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,260
Speaker 6:  a year, you're gonna have to start paying these fees. And these fees like

1007
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,390
Speaker 6:  are fairly small.

1008
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:51,010
Speaker 4:  What is the argument for per install fees?

1009
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:51,900
Speaker 6:  Money,

1010
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,420
Speaker 4:  But like, certainly as union made any argument that's not

1011
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,920
Speaker 6:  No. This, that's part of the frustration here. The frustration is less about

1012
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,800
Speaker 6:  the money being asked for because a lot of the Developers are

1013
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,630
Speaker 6:  like, yeah, if this is a cost of doing business, that's a cost of doing business.

1014
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,800
Speaker 6:  This was communicated to us in the worst way possible in the middle of an

1015
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,590
Speaker 6:  like a big Apple event. It gets communicated. There was no

1016
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:13,760
Speaker 6:  prep. Usually they'll go to like bigger Developers and be like, Hey, we're

1017
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,680
Speaker 6:  thinking about charging you more money. None of that happened in this

1018
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,580
Speaker 6:  case. And, and Unity is really like digging

1019
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:25,400
Speaker 6:  in on this every single time we'd get another thing, we'd get another

1020
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,900
Speaker 6:  report from a game developer saying, oh, we're gonna just delete our game

1021
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,600
Speaker 6:  rather than have to pay this. Which is what the cult of Lamb Developers said.

1022
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,440
Speaker 6:  I think they're still gonna keep their game up. But, and there are a

1023
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,360
Speaker 9:  Couple of really specific big problems too. The first being that it's not

1024
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,160
Speaker 9:  even necessarily clear how they track installs. That they're basically

1025
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,800
Speaker 9:  saying, yeah, we have this model, it's totally data compliant with data

1026
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,620
Speaker 9:  regulations. Totally not privacy. Invading also totally accurate. And also

1027
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,720
Speaker 9:  it totally won't, if somebody decides they hate you and they want to run

1028
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,440
Speaker 9:  a giant like route install bombing campaign to drive up your costs, it will

1029
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,120
Speaker 9:  also totally not include that. But no one has really figured out exactly

1030
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,680
Speaker 9:  what that means. And second, that installs are just not a thing that inherently

1031
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,780
Speaker 9:  makes Developers money. So they're charging for this thing that doesn't actually

1032
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,900
Speaker 9:  tie directly to revenue. Right.

1033
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,840
Speaker 6:  And that's what's, that's what's got people pissed is this thing is just,

1034
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,000
Speaker 6:  feels really, really egregious to them. It feels like it came on really,

1035
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,950
Speaker 6:  really quickly and there's zero communication Unity's just saying,

1036
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:23,040
Speaker 6:  yeah, we know you pay us every year to use our

1037
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,800
Speaker 6:  engine. Now you have to pay us more. Oh, you've had this game you

1038
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,960
Speaker 6:  developed on this engine for the last 10 years. We'll either learn a new

1039
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,630
Speaker 6:  engine or cough up the cash. And that just feels like

1040
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:37,000
Speaker 6:  extortion. It's not legally extortion, but it sure feels like it to

1041
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,020
Speaker 6:  Developers.

1042
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,990
Speaker 5:  How real do you think the threat is from all these Developers who are saying

1043
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:44,110
Speaker 5:  basically we'll leave Unity instead of pay these fees.

1044
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:47,200
Speaker 6:  Looking into that? I think it's, for a lot of 'em it's not realistic. If

1045
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,280
Speaker 6:  you've got, I mean it's

1046
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,950
Speaker 5:  Gotta be a gigantic amount of work.

1047
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:53,940
Speaker 6:  It's a huge amount of work. So, so for most of them it's probably not realistic.

1048
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:57,310
Speaker 6:  But Mo a lot of 'em are saying, well I'm never gonna develop in Unity again.

1049
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:00,480
Speaker 6:  Sure. And I'll probably pull those games. Right. Life is long. Yeah. Yeah.

1050
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,400
Speaker 6:  If, if you're a big developer, you can afford to pull a game that's made

1051
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,640
Speaker 6:  you a little money and you don't wanna pay anymore and go off and do something

1052
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,540
Speaker 6:  else. So it's kind of wild that Unity

1053
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:14,480
Speaker 6:  did this and the theories are, everybody's got a theory on why

1054
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,360
Speaker 6:  they did it. The most common one is they like money, which is

1055
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,760
Speaker 6:  fair. A lot of people think it might be because against an impact, which

1056
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,740
Speaker 6:  is huge on mobile and makes a lot of money and,

1057
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,820
Speaker 6:  and Unity would like some of that money

1058
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:30,280
Speaker 5:  And has been established Alison Johnson downloads 650 times a year.

1059
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,960
Speaker 4:  Yeah, very true. Yeah. So here's, here's a question I have. So you, you mentioned

1060
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,400
Speaker 4:  the iPhone Addie Apple's pushing into spatial

1061
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,080
Speaker 4:  computing with the Vision Pro. They basically need game

1062
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,060
Speaker 4:  engines to make a bunch of Vision Pro stuff.

1063
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,000
Speaker 6:  And Unity is core to that. Like Unity, right?

1064
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,640
Speaker 4:  Unity is a big deal in that world. It's big meta and Apple hates Epic, which

1065
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,600
Speaker 4:  makes the big competitor, right? Like Unreal is not gonna

1066
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,450
Speaker 4:  show up on Apple platforms as the alternative to Unity.

1067
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:56,830
Speaker 4:  Right?

1068
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:57,190
Speaker 6:  Well

1069
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,520
Speaker 4:  Anytime soon

1070
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,220
Speaker 6:  Are different engines like Unity is better for Monument in

1071
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,680
Speaker 6:  Valley and in smaller games like that, it's graphically intensive, but it's

1072
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,520
Speaker 6:  not like that photorealism, you don't see that as often in Unity games as

1073
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,320
Speaker 6:  you do in Unreal. Which makes sense because that's also less like taxing

1074
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,800
Speaker 6:  to the processor, which is one of the reasons Unity is so popular. Yeah.

1075
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,380
Speaker 6:  With Meta also because deals were made and stuff like that.

1076
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:23,690
Speaker 9:  But it's still one of the relatively, you have fewer options for developing

1077
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:27,520
Speaker 9:  three D and spatial games than you do for developing two D

1078
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,130
Speaker 9:  games. And Unity is definitely one of the huge

1079
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,840
Speaker 9:  three D options. Yeah. Because there are plenty of games that are three D

1080
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,420
Speaker 9:  but not photo realistic including a lot of like VR games, right? Yeah.

1081
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:41,240
Speaker 4:  So I'm just wondering is is in the midst of all of this, just turning the

1082
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,080
Speaker 4:  screw one time, you've covered VR more than anybody that

1083
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,480
Speaker 4:  I've ever met, this has some huge impact on how Apple's

1084
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,840
Speaker 4:  relationship to Developers is gonna go as they roll out the Vision Pro, right?

1085
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:55,640
Speaker 4:  Like if all the Developers are mad at the main engine, where else are they

1086
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,470
Speaker 4:  gonna go?

1087
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:59,760
Speaker 9:  It's a very good question and it's partly a question Ash is actually doing

1088
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,600
Speaker 9:  reporting on right now. Like there are alternatives that you can use. One

1089
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,270
Speaker 9:  of them is Gado, which is an open source engine, which is

1090
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:10,470
Speaker 9:  very tiny and is very hard. But yeah,

1091
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:14,190
Speaker 9:  it's, it's a good question whether that's a thing that makes Unity

1092
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:15,370
Speaker 9:  feel like it can flex,

1093
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,880
Speaker 4:  Right? That's kinda what I'm wondering. Like where's this leverage coming

1094
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,990
Speaker 4:  from? Like if you're like, we're gonna piss off everyone,

1095
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:24,120
Speaker 4:  usually it's because you can't, like you're Reddit. I was

1096
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,240
Speaker 5:  Just gonna say, this is what Reddit

1097
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,360
Speaker 4:  Did. Reddit's like, we need more money. We're gonna piss off everyone, but

1098
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:32,320
Speaker 4:  But are you gonna go? Yeah. And they just waited and it's, some parts of

1099
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,840
Speaker 4:  Reddit are still just a mess, but they just waited and it's

1100
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,560
Speaker 4:  fine. 'cause where are you gonna go? Who's the competitor? And it, there's

1101
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:42,700
Speaker 4:  just an echo of that in this Unity conversation. I'm especially as it relates

1102
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,640
Speaker 4:  to iOS, because the thing that is the natural

1103
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:49,240
Speaker 4:  competitor is at such odds with Apple at the corporate

1104
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:49,750
Speaker 4:  level.

1105
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:53,320
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I'm gonna be really curious to see how Apple responds to this over

1106
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,150
Speaker 6:  the next few weeks because it happened in the middle of their event. Like

1107
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:57,510
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1108
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:58,990
Speaker 4:  I wonder if Apple even knew as

1109
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:00,580
Speaker 5:  Apple was talking so much about mobile gaming.

1110
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:04,470
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's just, it feels like, like I don't think Apple knew or that probably

1111
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,230
Speaker 6:  wouldn't have happened that way. It's also not

1112
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:10,210
Speaker 9:  Particularly good for Apple. Like it's not great for Apple if one of

1113
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:14,150
Speaker 9:  the bottlenecks for their platform is suddenly taking a big fee from

1114
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:16,300
Speaker 9:  Developers that Apple doesn't see part of.

1115
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,250
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Only Apple gets to take fees.

1116
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:21,520
Speaker 4:  The Apple doesn't like money changing hands if it doesn't take 30% outta

1117
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,640
Speaker 4:  that money. All right, well we're gonna keep covering it. It sounds like

1118
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:27,560
Speaker 4:  Ash has a lot of reporting in the works. We'll put that on the site. It's

1119
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,150
Speaker 4:  a big deal. Like Unity canceled events. There were death threats over this.

1120
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:34,170
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Which again, I will point out is inappropriate.

1121
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,370
Speaker 6:  Don't do that.

1122
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:38,160
Speaker 4:  Socos, that's, that's life on the internet for you. There's bunch of stuff

1123
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,720
Speaker 4:  on the site that isn't Apple or the Google trial B'S just an

1124
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:45,480
Speaker 4:  overhauled its entire lineup of headphones. The Spectra Fold is out, which

1125
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:49,120
Speaker 4:  a foldable 17 ish pc, which is a very cool, Monica wrote that. Weird laptops.

1126
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:52,480
Speaker 4:  I love a weird laptop. And the workers of the big three auto Makers on strike

1127
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,500
Speaker 4:  this week, which Andy wrote about,

1128
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,020
Speaker 5:  And a million new video games

1129
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,550
Speaker 4:  And a million new video games intended to direct in the Sony state of play

1130
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:02,470
Speaker 4:  this week as well. On top of that, it continues to be September,

1131
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:05,440
Speaker 4:  just relentlessly. September. Ah, that's the name of my new

1132
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,150
Speaker 4:  album Relentlessly September by Neli Patel. It's,

1133
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:11,560
Speaker 4:  it's avant-garde, but I think you'll like it. We've had a bunch of events

1134
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:15,480
Speaker 4:  coming up. The code conference is at the end of this month. Here's

1135
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,320
Speaker 4:  the news. Virtual tickets for the code conference are now in sale. All the

1136
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,800
Speaker 4:  main tickets are sold out. So you can, if you wanna watch the code conference,

1137
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,760
Speaker 4:  go to Vox dot com slash code and you can sign up

1138
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,910
Speaker 4:  for virtual ticket and stream the thing. Mike Krieger from Artifact is coming.

1139
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:33,650
Speaker 4:  He's xct of Instagram now. The co-founder of Artifact, the news app

1140
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:36,390
Speaker 4:  David just wrote about it. They, they rolled out links. Yeah.

1141
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:40,320
Speaker 5:  They wanna be like the, the place to share cool stuff on the internet. 'cause

1142
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,740
Speaker 5:  Twitter used to be that and now Twitter's dead.

1143
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:44,960
Speaker 4:  And we, we love that. So Casey's gonna talk about Mike about that. And

1144
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,360
Speaker 4:  then, I dunno if you even pay attention to little company called

1145
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,100
Speaker 4:  Disney. Lots of weirdness in Disney World

1146
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:55,080
Speaker 4:  and lots of Liz, Disney World, lots of weirdness. And

1147
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,900
Speaker 5:  Mickey Mouse is coming to Code

1148
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,860
Speaker 4:  Disney. Bob Iger has been hinting that he might sell a, b, c,

1149
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:06,200
Speaker 4:  get rid of a bunch of stuff. Partner with E S P N, all this stuff. Byron

1150
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,000
Speaker 4:  Allen, who is the owner of the company that owns the Weather Channel, we

1151
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,440
Speaker 4:  invited him. 'cause they're doing a bunch of AI stuff on the Weather channel,

1152
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,400
Speaker 4:  climate change, ai, whole thing. It turns out he wants to buy a B,

1153
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,760
Speaker 4:  C for $10 billion. It's

1154
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,560
Speaker 6:  Like him and Next Star. Yeah. So both of them are are

1155
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,470
Speaker 6:  smaller companies. They're less known for for Yeah. Being Disney.

1156
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:27,950
Speaker 6:  They're not Disney, but it's a big deal.

1157
