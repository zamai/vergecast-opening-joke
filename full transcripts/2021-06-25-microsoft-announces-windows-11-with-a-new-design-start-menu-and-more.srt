Speaker 1:  me. Tom Warren is here. Hey Tom. Hi

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,890
Speaker 5:  There I run windows apps, Android apps, iOS apps,

36
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,570
Speaker 5:  web apps, everything.

37
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,050
Speaker 1:  Yeah, there was a lot of talk about web apps and Android apps at the same

38
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,980
Speaker 1:  time today. Anyway, Thomas here, cause it's windows 11 day,

39
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,820
Speaker 1:  we're coming off a sprint of windows, 11 news.

40
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,540
Speaker 1:  Tom literally just came from a meeting with Microsoft talking about windows

41
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,960
Speaker 1:  11. He's on the show. Now tons of news about

42
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,590
Speaker 1:  windows. We'll get to it all. Actually a lot to talk about windows is going

43
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,250
Speaker 1:  to run Android apps. This is a big, big situation, but as always, I want

44
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,180
Speaker 1:  to start at start the pandemic, which is really not quite over around the

45
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,780
Speaker 1:  world. Marybeth, Greg's wrote a great piece for us called the slow transitions

46
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,350
Speaker 1:  of a lingering pandemic. Go read that it lays out kind of where we

47
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,440
Speaker 1:  are, the stutter steps around the

48
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,800
Speaker 1:  world that are coming because it's not quite over yet.

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,740
Speaker 1:  So we're still really focused on that. But vaccination in United

50
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,360
Speaker 1:  States means that it feels over for us, but it's not quite over in many other

51
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Speaker 1:  places around the world. And indeed many other places United States, we always

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,750
Speaker 1:  talked about second order effects of the pandemic. We have a great big feature

53
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,370
Speaker 1:  on the radio stations of the Navajo nation and how they were broadcasting

54
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,130
Speaker 1:  throughout the pandemic. And it became more important to the community. And

55
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,130
Speaker 1:  it's like, I always think of the verge is really just being off the movie,

56
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,000
Speaker 1:  pump up the volume. So anytime we do like how important radio station stories,

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,990
Speaker 1:  I love them that one's great. And then Indian healthcare workers

58
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,320
Speaker 1:  are trying to get a handle on misinformation about

59
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,190
Speaker 1:  COVID in WhatsApp, which is a big problem. We've got a great big story

60
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,030
Speaker 1:  about that. We're trying to do more coverage about just

61
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,630
Speaker 1:  technology in India. A lot of what we see there from a

62
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,560
Speaker 1:  regulatory standpoint, from how Facebook is user, how WhatsApp is used.

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,430
Speaker 1:  There feel like previews of what's happening here. We also

64
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,300
Speaker 1:  have a great big audience in India and we have a great big audience

65
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,900
Speaker 1:  of obviously the Indian diaspora in the United States that works in tech.

66
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,380
Speaker 1:  So we're working on it. There's, there's some things there. If you think

67
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,950
Speaker 1:  about how India regulates social media apps, real big

68
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,310
Speaker 1:  previews of some of the things that get talked about here. So we want to

69
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,580
Speaker 1:  explore it more. And so this story about WhatsApp and how healthcare workers

70
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,360
Speaker 1:  are using it to, to fight COVID misinformation are, is, is really interesting.

71
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,660
Speaker 1:  Check that. Okay. Windows 11,

72
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,590
Speaker 1:  Tom. Ooh.

73
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,190
Speaker 5:  It's a lot of love windows 11 today. Yeah. Yeah. Where do I

74
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,760
Speaker 5:  begin? So, I mean, we've talked about this on the verge cuts before,

75
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,390
Speaker 5:  but there was a lot today you start menu and you design

76
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,930
Speaker 5:  Android apps. So should we start from the design?

77
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,630
Speaker 1:  I think we should start with the fact that Microsoft tried to host a live

78
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,990
Speaker 1:  stream. Microsoft. One of the world's biggest cloud computing

79
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,800
Speaker 1:  providers was not able to execute a live stream for

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,700
Speaker 1:  windows. Was it Azure? Did that fail? I don't think we'll ever know. I

81
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,330
Speaker 1:  just know that eventually Microsoft executives were like

82
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,910
Speaker 1:  tweeting out YouTube links so people could watch this thing.

83
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,610
Speaker 5:  All I know is that I watched the majority of it through

84
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,150
Speaker 5:  Twitter. I don't typically watch Twitter videos cause

85
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,050
Speaker 5:  they crushed the compression of ink, but it worked fine

86
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,930
Speaker 5:  through there. But yeah, through Microsoft's own streaming, it was, yeah,

87
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,150
Speaker 5:  it was terrible.

88
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,340
Speaker 1:  So that was kind of the stutter start to the whole

89
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,060
Speaker 1:  thing started out with Penn has been a, has she product officer

90
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,930
Speaker 1:  Microsoft? One thing I was not expecting, and this was the

91
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,260
Speaker 1:  frame, they put her on the whole thing. They were like, oh shit, windows

92
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,720
Speaker 1:  is important.

93
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,620
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

94
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,190
Speaker 5:  That seems to be like the, the thing they realized during the

95
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,660
Speaker 5:  pandemic, essentially

96
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,440
Speaker 1:  They were like explicit about it. Panels was like, damn, I used the windows.

97
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,100
Speaker 5:  I literally just finished speaking to panels. And he was kind of saying that

98
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,370
Speaker 5:  basically that they obviously went in, started this work on 10

99
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,240
Speaker 5:  X. So the last time they did a surface event in New York, it was this jewel

100
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,480
Speaker 5:  screen device is 10 X was the thing that they were going to do is it's new

101
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,440
Speaker 5:  version of windows, 10 CIOs screen devices. And then when

102
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,310
Speaker 5:  the pandemic comes, everyone's rushing out to get laptops and to

103
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,300
Speaker 5:  work from home. Like they, they obviously see way more into the metrics and

104
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,780
Speaker 5:  the telemetry and everything else than we would ever do. But I think their

105
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,620
Speaker 5:  argument is that people are using windows more and they're not picking up

106
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,050
Speaker 5:  their phones when they're at home, when stuck in doors, you know, like you,

107
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,930
Speaker 5:  you and I know that I'm not like I'm more glued to my laptop than I've ever

108
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,920
Speaker 5:  been at my desktop than I've ever been before. So I think they've obviously

109
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,640
Speaker 5:  realized that opportunity to then try and keep people glued to those

110
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,630
Speaker 5:  devices when we start venturing out into the world and have this

111
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,590
Speaker 5:  hybrid workplace. But it's also that they've had to like redesign and

112
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,460
Speaker 5:  re work windows during that pandemic to then

113
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,940
Speaker 5:  try and guess where people are going to be using it. Like when we start going,

114
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,480
Speaker 5:  trying to get feel back to the office and stuff, which is kind of happening

115
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,410
Speaker 5:  in a lot of locations now. So it's definitely an interesting time to launch

116
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,300
Speaker 5:  a new version of windows under that whole era of the pandemic. You

117
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,740
Speaker 1:  Just talked to pantos Sasha and Adela is on decoder. By the time you listened

118
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,050
Speaker 1:  to this, it'll be out there coming out at the same time. And he mentioned

119
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,990
Speaker 1:  to me, he said the same thing. He's like, I never had a home office. And

120
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,230
Speaker 1:  then I had one in my girls were at home and he got all the way

121
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,830
Speaker 1:  to, I'm really proud of windows update and how it works now. And I was like,

122
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,670
Speaker 1:  oh, you were annoyed too. Like it

123
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,120
Speaker 1:  happened, right? Like they all stopped using their managed computers at the

124
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,900
Speaker 1:  office in Redmond. All of their executives are at home and they're like,

125
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,680
Speaker 1:  oh, we can make windows easier and better to use. And there was just a lot

126
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,490
Speaker 1:  of that. Like throughout this event, they were just kind of

127
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,560
Speaker 1:  explicitly saying it to me,

128
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,460
Speaker 4:  The feature that like most clearly shows it is they

129
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,270
Speaker 4:  fixed your windows, flying all over creation. When you plug in a

130
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,200
Speaker 4:  monitor or unplug the monitor, they actually go where they're supposed to.

131
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,070
Speaker 4:  And then come back to where they were. And it's like, oh, they

132
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,030
Speaker 4:  actually like are using monitors at home. They're actually using their devices

133
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,850
Speaker 4:  in a multimodal way. They're not just leading them around their desk at the

134
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,030
Speaker 4:  office. Now they, they finally get it. Yeah.

135
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,340
Speaker 1:  It's a little dark.

136
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,950
Speaker 5:  It's slightly all turned into windows, laptop reviews

137
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,880
Speaker 5:  overnight. Like this one thing that never really

138
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,630
Speaker 5:  affected me. Oh man, does it affect me now?

139
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,380
Speaker 5:  So

140
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,280
Speaker 1:  Just a remarkable frame for an event that they were, they were honest

141
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,910
Speaker 1:  about it. I, I appreciated that, but then there's a lot of changes.

142
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,120
Speaker 1:  So the last time you were on, we were talking about a leak build. They went

143
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,930
Speaker 1:  farther than the leaks in many ways. What were the big, big changes to the

144
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,500
Speaker 1:  UI?

145
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,950
Speaker 5:  Yeah, because obviously the leak was kind of just scratching the surface.

146
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,640
Speaker 5:  I feel like there was a lot more than, than what we thought was

147
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,390
Speaker 5:  coming. The big sort of visual stuff, design stuff is a new

148
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,840
Speaker 5:  start menu. It's centered. They made a big deal about that. Obviously they

149
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,770
Speaker 5:  couldn't really avoid it and it can be put to the left-hand side. We know

150
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,760
Speaker 5:  that, but it's, it's centered. You start button, the actual

151
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,330
Speaker 5:  start menu itself. When you launch it is more like a launch.

152
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,900
Speaker 5:  Now I know we talked about this before, but like, is, it is almost like

153
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,590
Speaker 5:  you're an app launcher. Like you try and on Android, like it's

154
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,580
Speaker 5:  obviously heavily inspired by Android Chrome iOS, even macro S right.

155
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,340
Speaker 5:  Like it kind of matches up to everything now.

156
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,000
Speaker 5:  So it's going to be censored by default. You'll get like your

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,980
Speaker 5:  search on there. You get pinned apps, your recent, it feels just a

158
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,970
Speaker 5:  lot more usable than the current start menu. I know D likes

159
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,300
Speaker 5:  live tiles. I, I ha I read about it on the LifeLock

160
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,510
Speaker 5:  today.

161
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,110
Speaker 4:  I will like the new widget system that we'll talk about in a minute better,

162
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,890
Speaker 4:  but there is something useful about having like the

163
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,740
Speaker 4:  original, you know, windows, phone dream. Like here's this place you go.

164
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,310
Speaker 4:  And it has all the stuff you need to launch your apps. But it also like has

165
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,640
Speaker 4:  a little bit information that it's just nice to see real quick while you're

166
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,190
Speaker 4:  doing the other thing. So like, oh, the weather's there. Okay, great. Oh,

167
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,010
Speaker 4:  this is what's playing right now. Okay, great. But that's all going away.

168
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,900
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That's all going away. But I feel like at

169
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,750
Speaker 4:  The same way, I feel about Android widgets where it's like, if everybody

170
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,710
Speaker 4:  tried really hard to make them and keep them updated, then it would be great.

171
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,190
Speaker 4:  But no one seems to be able to maintain that for more than like three months,

172
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:40,880
Speaker 4:  you know?

173
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,330
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like that's obviously going away from the start menu, that lifestyle

174
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,720
Speaker 5:  thing. And then that is actually been shifted into a separate sort of

175
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,660
Speaker 5:  section a panel of glass, I think is what they described as in the,

176
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,180
Speaker 5:  in the event. Hi, I'm

177
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,660
Speaker 1:  Said it in chat during the event. There's a lot of Vista

178
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,590
Speaker 1:  vibes through windows holiness, right? Lots

179
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,310
Speaker 1:  of frosted transparency, lots of layers. A

180
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,640
Speaker 1:  lot of Vista vibes going on here and now maybe the hardware's fast

181
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,030
Speaker 1:  enough.

182
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,820
Speaker 5:  It's very glassy. Yeah. It's the way they call it. Yeah. And

183
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,540
Speaker 5:  like that, that fostered panel glass thing slides

184
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,380
Speaker 5:  in, and it's basically we, your widgets. So we don't, they didn't really

185
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,130
Speaker 5:  get into the detail of like how these are gonna, you know, like developers

186
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,220
Speaker 5:  are going to be able to plug into this stuff, but they showed up like newsfeeds,

187
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,800
Speaker 5:  some verge. Of course

188
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,890
Speaker 1:  There are two different verticals in there and their demos and PR all right,

189
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,380
Speaker 1:  I'll take it. The weather's in there. Yeah.

190
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,380
Speaker 4:  Freaked me out was when they said that this was like, there there's like

191
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,190
Speaker 4:  going to be an AI. And it was like a feed. And I was like, oh God,

192
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,670
Speaker 4:  this is basically like the left of home, Google menu. This is going to

193
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,600
Speaker 4:  suck. But it looks like you, it's a combination of widgets that you

194
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,440
Speaker 4:  move around and place yourself. And then underneath that, all the news feed

195
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,860
Speaker 4:  stuff. And so they're not going to try and do the Google mouse thing where

196
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,160
Speaker 4:  they like show you what you think you need there. You know, when you need

197
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,220
Speaker 4:  it, you're actually going to be able to organize your own damn widgets the

198
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,180
Speaker 4:  way you want. And then underneath that, or next to it will be

199
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,960
Speaker 4:  the news feed stuff is my hunch. Oh, you harsher. Right? Like

200
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,430
Speaker 4:  they know

201
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,240
Speaker 1:  That everybody uses windows has a phone. And just like Tom was saying, the

202
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,170
Speaker 1:  start menu is starting to converge on what everything else looks like. This

203
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,010
Speaker 1:  left of home widget system is converging on what Android

204
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,640
Speaker 1:  looks like in some way, what iOS is doing in some way, what

205
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,970
Speaker 1:  Samsung is doing in some way, there are differences.

206
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,690
Speaker 1:  Yes. Like minor execution differences. Yeah. But the way

207
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,350
Speaker 1:  windows is organized now, just roughly

208
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,160
Speaker 1:  approximates the way everything else is organized. I think that's

209
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,000
Speaker 1:  smart. I don't, I don't think it's the wrong thing to do. I just the idea

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,990
Speaker 1:  that this is some sort of breakthrough pattern of user

211
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,940
Speaker 1:  behavior is like, nah, this, this is kinda what an iPad

212
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,870
Speaker 1:  looks like. And also kind of what Samsung phone looks like and kind of

213
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,410
Speaker 1:  what a Chromebook looks like. It means it's easier to switch between

214
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,370
Speaker 1:  devices, which I'm always banging on about making it easier to

215
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,240
Speaker 1:  switch. They actually feel some competition, but it's also like, like you

216
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,420
Speaker 1:  were saying neater, like this stuff only works with people like developers

217
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,660
Speaker 1:  participate in it. And if you're like a widget developer, you're like, where

218
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,640
Speaker 1:  do I go? What do I do? Like you just kind of like wanna make an app

219
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:20,940
Speaker 1:  that makes

220
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,810
Speaker 6:  Them money and stuff, which you don't need life. You think

221
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,620
Speaker 4:  About it this whole, like it's an entire other layer of the system on

222
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,100
Speaker 4:  top of it. It might as well be underneath the desktop full of

223
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,820
Speaker 4:  glanceable information wizards. It's almost like a, like a dashboard,

224
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,470
Speaker 4:  right. I'm

225
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,680
Speaker 1:  Still extremely salty for

226
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,550
Speaker 1:  years. I had a dashboard widget that just told me

227
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,770
Speaker 1:  what time, like it was called Kronos. I can't believe I'm talking about a

228
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,420
Speaker 1:  Chronos ladder. It would just tell me what time it was, where

229
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,380
Speaker 1:  everybody you could like sly, you would like slide a slider and

230
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,300
Speaker 1:  he'd be like, it's four. O'clock my time. And then it would tell me what

231
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,900
Speaker 1:  time it was everywhere that the verge team was. Yeah. And they took it away

232
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,380
Speaker 1:  from me. And now I'm just like, whatever. It's two in the morning for Tommy,

233
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,560
Speaker 1:  he's getting the slack anyway.

234
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,340
Speaker 6:  And it's all because of widget study. Cause it

235
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,490
Speaker 5:  Ruined everyone's life. That's the interesting part of this is that it all

236
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,090
Speaker 5:  comes under this panel. You can't like drop these widgets on a desktop.

237
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,050
Speaker 5:  You know, you obviously could in macro S and obviously in Vista as

238
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,800
Speaker 5:  well, they did these widgets. They did a similar thing in Vista

239
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,730
Speaker 5:  back in the day in like windows 98. I kind of remember active

240
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,720
Speaker 5:  desktop similar sort of thing, which is so that these things live in their

241
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,440
Speaker 5:  own slide out. So I'm curious about that. Like, are

242
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,230
Speaker 5:  people really going to slide out to get these widgets? Where are they putting

243
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,110
Speaker 1:  Notifications in all of this on the right same way they are now? Yeah.

244
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,400
Speaker 5:  The notification cation center is pretty much the same as it was in windows

245
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,580
Speaker 5:  10. It just looks better. They've changed a few things around that and obviously

246
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,760
Speaker 5:  the volume fly outs and stuff like that. Like the one in windows 10 right

247
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,210
Speaker 5:  now it's super annoying. The one in windows 11 is not as super annoying.

248
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,380
Speaker 5:  So

249
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,160
Speaker 1:  I'll just say between the leak and then this, with the transparency and seeing

250
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,550
Speaker 1:  some of these additional features, it looks a lot better than I expected

251
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,090
Speaker 1:  from the lakes. Like some of the stuff where there's

252
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,720
Speaker 1:  ancient parts of the elements or ancient parts of the interface and control

253
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,650
Speaker 1:  centers. Like yeah. There's like windows stuff going on in

254
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,560
Speaker 1:  here that everyone has always complained about, but just in

255
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,460
Speaker 1:  general it looks a lot tinier and more modern. And

256
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,390
Speaker 1:  this like ultra flat windows, 10 interface was starting to age out

257
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,530
Speaker 1:  and this looks a lot better.

258
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,400
Speaker 5:  And, and they did show some of the dark mode stuff and it's, it looks like

259
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,760
Speaker 5:  they're actually going to make sure dark mode is a bit more

260
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,660
Speaker 5:  universal because I have dark mode running on my windows 10 PC

261
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,350
Speaker 5:  right now, but I could do stuff like going to start and run. And

262
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,800
Speaker 5:  in immediately that dialog box it's, you know, it's is a white

263
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,490
Speaker 5:  mode element. So it's like, they're starting to think about those sort of

264
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,440
Speaker 5:  things that they kind missed or which are really glaringly obvious. And

265
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,830
Speaker 5:  just, I feel like they're getting all the touch points where you really interact

266
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,340
Speaker 5:  with windows where it really matters and yes, yes. There's going to be stuff

267
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,160
Speaker 5:  like control panels probably still there. Right? Like that's not going away.

268
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,090
Speaker 5:  Richard is still there, all this stuff buried underneath. But I think

269
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,850
Speaker 5:  as long as that, stuff's still there for people who need it, but like, you

270
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,660
Speaker 5:  don't stumble across it from just a, you know, just using your

271
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,500
Speaker 5:  computer for a zoom call or whatever. Then I don't think it's so

272
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,040
Speaker 5:  much of a big deal as long as they make it just way more usable. And this

273
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,850
Speaker 5:  does look a lot more usable. We have to play around with it. Obviously. I

274
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,120
Speaker 5:  also

275
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,980
Speaker 1:  Like just compared to what apple is doing in big Sur, which

276
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,640
Speaker 1:  is a nightmare of crap that happens on the right side of your

277
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,500
Speaker 1:  screen. This makes a lot more sense.

278
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,250
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like it does, it does look like they've gone down the simplification

279
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,580
Speaker 5:  route, which they were obviously going for windows 10 X and it feels like

280
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,610
Speaker 5:  they've got the right ideas. So it's just how it plays out. So

281
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,300
Speaker 1:  10 X was like going to happen and it feels like they took all of those ideas

282
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,960
Speaker 1:  and just made it windows 11. Is that more or less what happened here? Pretty

283
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,260
Speaker 1:  much.

284
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,250
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like they, they basically supercharged those ideas. I think like the,

285
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,090
Speaker 5:  even like down to the Android apps on windows stuff, I think that was probably

286
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,180
Speaker 5:  always going to come to Tenex at some point. It's just that stuff just being

287
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,080
Speaker 5:  accelerated for, you know, get that in windows and let it get out or all

288
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,830
Speaker 5:  machines. And it's, it's also interesting that this is obviously arriving

289
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,730
Speaker 5:  in like October time, roughly. And it's, it's an interesting

290
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,570
Speaker 5:  release of windows as well, because it's also, it's almost going to demand

291
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,840
Speaker 5:  like new hardware, which we haven't really seen for

292
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,380
Speaker 5:  windows since like windows eight, really? Because windows 10, wasn't really

293
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,130
Speaker 5:  a hardware thing. It was more of a like, yeah, we kind of

294
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,090
Speaker 5:  messed up windows eight, see these install this immediately, it's

295
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,300
Speaker 5:  a free upgrade. So that's, that's another sort of interesting

296
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,300
Speaker 5:  dimensions to see what sort of hardware comes in

297
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,670
Speaker 4:  Tom, since you brought it up. I mean, we've got to get into a bunch of other

298
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,540
Speaker 4:  stuff. I really want to talk about the, the new step guide stuff or snap

299
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,610
Speaker 4:  layout stuff. I knew that's what you were going to say.

300
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,580
Speaker 6:  It's coming, it's coming. I'm so excited about it. Requiring

301
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,520
Speaker 4:  New hardware comes with like, it's going to entice some people to upgrade.

302
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,400
Speaker 4:  There's this thing where like the stylist has haptics and that might entice

303
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,640
Speaker 4:  some people to upgrade, but can you talk about this, this issue that's been

304
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,880
Speaker 4:  flying around today with windows health check and you need a certain kind

305
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,960
Speaker 4:  of thing and your bios

306
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,140
Speaker 5:  And seminars. Yeah. That's, that's definitely been something that's been,

307
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,070
Speaker 5:  been flying around, so they have actually made it. So you need to have a

308
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:15,790
Speaker 5:  TPM 2.0 chip, which basically it sounds

309
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,540
Speaker 5:  complicated, but it, that should have shipped with any sort of modern CPU

310
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,530
Speaker 5:  in the last decade. Really. So, and I think it's been a requirement of like

311
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,370
Speaker 5:  windows PCs since like 2016. So like if you've got a

312
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,460
Speaker 5:  relatively new device in the last sort of five years, then you should be

313
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,390
Speaker 5:  fine. I think what people are seeing is that they they're

314
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,230
Speaker 5:  in, like, they have a device where they don't have a TPM chip maybe,

315
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,830
Speaker 5:  or they've got it, but it's not fully enabled in the bile. So I'd love to

316
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,550
Speaker 5:  see how Microsoft's going to solve that and tell people to dig into bile

317
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,010
Speaker 5:  screens, which are always different on every single

318
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,720
Speaker 5:  device. That's going to be like an interesting

319
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,280
Speaker 5:  one. They

320
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Speaker 4:  Can just tell people to go visit a Microsoft store. Oh yeah.

321
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,100
Speaker 4:  Oh,

322
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,800
Speaker 5:  Microsoft experience center. There's only three of them in the world, but

323
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,340
Speaker 1:  That's why it's such an experience. I've got to get to one it's a

324
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,090
Speaker 1:  long, it's a long journey actually do. Let's talk about when snapping, cause

325
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,290
Speaker 1:  I think we're going to end up spending a lot of time on Android apps. Okay.

326
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,870
Speaker 1:  We talk a lot about windowing on this show. We mostly talk about it in the

327
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,650
Speaker 1:  context of the iPad because they've had is horrible at

328
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,580
Speaker 1:  it. Yeah. Microsoft is just leaning all the way into it. Like you're going

329
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,180
Speaker 1:  to have a bunch of windows and our system should arrange them for you. And

330
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,570
Speaker 1:  like in reality, there's only what is it? Six layouts that you might actually

331
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,840
Speaker 1:  want and here they are. And it seems so

332
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,110
Speaker 1:  simple and it is kind of genius.

333
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,710
Speaker 4:  Well, they're also, they and I I've had, I was 15 to doing the same thing

334
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,470
Speaker 4:  where they, they like, they know no one's going to ever remember the stupid

335
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,010
Speaker 4:  swipe gestures to like snap the window into the corner that you wanted or

336
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,620
Speaker 4:  whatever. So in the same way that iPad has, and Samsung have like the 3d

337
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,430
Speaker 4:  menus to show you the layout options. They're just doing that with the expando

338
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,580
Speaker 4:  button, the square button on a window and they show you the tile

339
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,270
Speaker 4:  options. And I think that's fine. I love that. They're just being way

340
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,900
Speaker 4:  smarter about maintaining your layouts. You can apparently save

341
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,770
Speaker 4:  layouts and there'll be like a whole mix of like, your desktop is over here

342
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,440
Speaker 4:  and then your snap layouts are here. And like, people might get confused

343
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,160
Speaker 4:  by that. But just looking at it, my hunch is that

344
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,740
Speaker 4:  people will like find one thing that they like it'll get saved in their doc

345
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,070
Speaker 4:  and all that extra complexity will be there for power users. But hopefully

346
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,700
Speaker 4:  won't get in the way of, you know, normal people that just want to have their

347
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,110
Speaker 4:  windows stay where they're supposed to.

348
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,710
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it's super interesting that they're surfacing basically what's

349
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,640
Speaker 5:  already existed in windows for years, these select snap areas. So

350
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,910
Speaker 5:  you can cascade windows, you can snap them side by side. Have you been able

351
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,900
Speaker 5:  to do this, but in with a bunch of windows shortcuts or just with your mouse,

352
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,500
Speaker 5:  but it's not, you know, most windows use it like regular windows users never

353
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,530
Speaker 5:  knew that you could even probably do that. So it's like, they're literally

354
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,230
Speaker 5:  surfacing on the maximize button, which is super interesting.

355
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,030
Speaker 1:  Keep coming back to this idea that all of their executives were working at

356
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,900
Speaker 1:  home and they were like doing the same thing that everyone else

357
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,410
Speaker 1:  does in like slack or teams or whatever. And someone's like, oh, there's

358
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,010
Speaker 1:  a keyboard command to snap your windows to the right. And Panis was like

359
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,870
Speaker 1:  really

360
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,900
Speaker 6:  Right. Like patos pedals do come on.

361
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,530
Speaker 1:  I don't know, man. Well, no, cause he's in flow. He definitely knew. Okay.

362
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:16,400
Speaker 1:  I'll, I'll give you an S like definitely he knows he's got a macro to get

363
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,210
Speaker 1:  himself to be some marketing exec for sure. But it's

364
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,840
Speaker 1:  true of the iPad too. Like what is the big theme across all these operating

365
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,830
Speaker 1:  systems? This year, they took a bunch of power user features and they

366
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,740
Speaker 1:  just made them obvious for people. And they stopped treating everybody like

367
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,400
Speaker 1:  idiots, right? Like for what a full decade,

368
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,210
Speaker 1:  the dominant design attitude was, most

369
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,630
Speaker 1:  people are stupid and can only do one thing at a time. And that's how our

370
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,590
Speaker 1:  operating systems work. And like just over the past year, they're like,

371
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,760
Speaker 1:  what if we're not stupid?

372
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,300
Speaker 6:  What if you'd like

373
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,080
Speaker 1:  To use your computer in a multiple different ways? And we, you can

374
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,710
Speaker 1:  handle the complexity of windows, not

375
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,640
Speaker 1:  windows. You understand what I'm saying? Yeah. It's just hilarious

376
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,030
Speaker 1:  to me that it, right. Like I talked about second order effects of the pandemic.

377
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,450
Speaker 1:  This is like the 50th order effect of the pandemic

378
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,290
Speaker 1:  is big tech companies are like, we think our users are not

379
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,250
Speaker 1:  complete idiots when it comes to organizing windows on a desktop. And it's

380
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,180
Speaker 1:  just like hilarious to me that it is true of Apple's operating systems and

381
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,840
Speaker 1:  it is natural windows that they're just showing you the complexity and trusting

382
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,460
Speaker 1:  you to solve it. And everyone's like, this is

383
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,290
Speaker 5:  Awesome. I'd also love to know like the stats from Microsoft

384
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,160
Speaker 5:  on how many people in the pandemic have suddenly gone from using one

385
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,790
Speaker 5:  screen, wherever it'd be big, regardless of the resolution to using

386
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,270
Speaker 5:  too. Because like, I just know, anecdotally people

387
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,630
Speaker 5:  who've been having to shift at work in the live room have had gone out and

388
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,260
Speaker 5:  bought a monitor, a 24 inch monitor and then used

389
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,710
Speaker 5:  both. But they're using their laptop screen. Whereas in, in the office they

390
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,280
Speaker 5:  would just be using the monitor they've got in their office and not, not

391
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,550
Speaker 5:  leave necessarily using both of them. I have a machine in the office. So

392
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,730
Speaker 5:  I'd love to know that because that like plays into this snap thing is that

393
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,880
Speaker 5:  these snack groups have the see, save where all your windows

394
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,540
Speaker 5:  are, which has been a real big problem. When you connect

395
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,390
Speaker 5:  up a windows, laptop to another monitoring, all your windows, just fly

396
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,140
Speaker 5:  around.

397
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,430
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. That's what Deidre is saying. Yeah. They all had that experience

398
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,390
Speaker 1:  of on this call, but my kids are being loud. I got to unplug my laptop and

399
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,870
Speaker 1:  go somewhere else and then plug it back in and everything is messed

400
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,260
Speaker 1:  up. There's like, I don't know why. Maybe it's because they were

401
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,190
Speaker 1:  so honest about their rethinking windows because of the pandemic. I just

402
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,060
Speaker 1:  look at this stuff and I'm like, oh, a lot of people had to actually use

403
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,720
Speaker 1:  their products this past year across the companies. And they're doing

404
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,680
Speaker 1:  things that previously they insisted to us

405
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,380
Speaker 1:  that only some small percentage of people actually want it.

406
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. All

407
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,990
Speaker 1:  Right. Well that obviously brings us to enter it apps and windows, which

408
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,230
Speaker 1:  I guarantee you only some small percentage. Sure. People, you know,

409
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,530
Speaker 4:  Another thing that every single Microsoft executive was forced to use during

410
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,590
Speaker 4:  the pandemic was teams. And now there's a big damn button for

411
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,630
Speaker 6:  The task bar.

412
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,110
Speaker 5:  If you're in windows 11, do you know? What's not everywhere in windows 11,

413
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,600
Speaker 5:  Skype op op, because teams as teams has taken over.

414
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,910
Speaker 5:  Right. Okay. It's just

415
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,750
Speaker 1:  About time. I mean that's years in the making. So here's, so they put teams

416
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,110
Speaker 1:  in a start button. They're giving a teams account to

417
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,980
Speaker 1:  everyone now. Yep. Which is one of those we're

418
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,940
Speaker 1:  making it great for you also, we're a giant dominant monopoly, not everybody

419
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,930
Speaker 1:  as a default teams account. Which one do you think it is? Got

420
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,720
Speaker 1:  this feature that Dieter, I'm just assuming you understand, maybe only

421
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,770
Speaker 1:  understand, so you can message anybody in

422
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,730
Speaker 1:  teams across a range of formats. Yep.

423
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,430
Speaker 1:  And then like if the person you're trying to message, doesn't have a teams

424
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,820
Speaker 1:  account it'll fall back to SMS using

425
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,620
Speaker 1:  correct. Your phone number, using your phone number. That's what they have

426
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,430
Speaker 1:  said. I

427
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,960
Speaker 4:  Have tweeted someone to please answer how this works to me.

428
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,470
Speaker 4:  I've hunted around a little bit, a Microsoft site can't find it. And I've

429
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:00,430
Speaker 4:  also emailed Microsoft PR and said, how does this work?

430
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,740
Speaker 4:  And I have yet to find an answer. Cause the

431
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,670
Speaker 1:  Other option is every windows machine gets a new phone

432
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:10,420
Speaker 1:  number that can use SMS. Right. Which seems even

433
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,750
Speaker 1:  more unworkable than, than using SMS.

434
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,200
Speaker 4:  It's unclear. Like how do they, how, if they're, if they're texting from

435
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,530
Speaker 4:  your phone number, there's like two ways to do that. Three ways to do it.

436
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,340
Speaker 4:  One, you like mirror to the Android phone. You can do that. Now on windows

437
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,700
Speaker 4:  10, you can like set up a web app that beers to your Android phone. You can

438
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,450
Speaker 4:  do that on any platform or you a text from the

439
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,690
Speaker 4:  phone. That's a way you just use the phone, but that's not obviously what

440
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,870
Speaker 4:  this is doing. Or you sort of a deal with every single carrier on the planet

441
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,470
Speaker 4:  and let them give you a backdoor into their SMS system, which seems unlikely

442
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,130
Speaker 4:  to me. So they must, I have no idea how this works,

443
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,120
Speaker 5:  Unless, because SMS is so sketchy

444
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,080
Speaker 5:  that you can just pretend you are that number

445
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,850
Speaker 5:  that's possible.

446
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,720
Speaker 1:  Okay. I'm just going to read you that this is in their blog post.

447
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,990
Speaker 1:  Now you can instantly connect through text, chat, voice, or video with all

448
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,440
Speaker 1:  of your personal contacts anywhere, no matter the platform or device they're

449
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,200
Speaker 1:  on across windows, Android or

450
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,070
Speaker 1:  iOS, if that's all about teams, right. That's what they're saying.

451
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,880
Speaker 1:  Yeah. If the person you're connecting to on the other end, hasn't

452
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,780
Speaker 1:  downloaded the teams app. You can still connect with them via

453
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,740
Speaker 1:  two way. SMS. Yeah. No further

454
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,940
Speaker 1:  information.

455
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,810
Speaker 4:  Here's my hunch. They get a text from a random number saying Nila

456
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:32,440
Speaker 4:  wants to chat. This is what he said. And then they could reply to that thing.

457
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,410
Speaker 4:  And it creates a relay that texts back to you until they finally give up

458
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,700
Speaker 4:  and install the teams. Yeah. Yeah.

459
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,550
Speaker 1:  At the end of every message is download the teens up here with the short

460
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,270
Speaker 1:  link.

461
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,140
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Sent from Microsoft teams. Shortlink I will

462
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,070
Speaker 4:  Tell you that one of the only companies to sign on

463
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,000
Speaker 4:  to promise that they would someday adopt RCS

464
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,990
Speaker 4:  was Microsoft.

465
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:56,560
Speaker 1:  No, God. Oh no. This is a direct call out to

466
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,520
Speaker 1:  two-way SMS. Yeah. There's no, there's no RCS in here. I

467
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,300
Speaker 1:  just, yeah. They called it out. They're excited about it. No details on how

468
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,110
Speaker 1:  it works. If they've actually managed to figure out how to

469
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,070
Speaker 1:  let your windows computer, or just do SMS through teams using

470
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,890
Speaker 1:  your phone number, that's a huge deal. We just don't know.

471
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,140
Speaker 5:  I had to mention it's something to do with your phone.

472
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,990
Speaker 1:  Nobody. Cause I said iOS to you don't need it. You don't need an Android

473
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,770
Speaker 1:  phones do this. Yeah. And I have no deal with apple as far as I know.

474
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,430
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Although in, in his interview with Joanna stern, Satya said that anything

475
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,610
Speaker 4:  apple wants to do with windows, whether it's iTunes or I iMessage or what

476
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:33,040
Speaker 4:  have you, we would welcome that. Yeah.

477
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,790
Speaker 4:  So hold your breath there. Satya. All right.

478
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,420
Speaker 4:  Well

479
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,750
Speaker 1:  That brings us to like the biggest thing and windows

480
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,730
Speaker 1:  11 in terms of architectural, which is there's

481
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,570
Speaker 1:  a new Microsoft store that store

482
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,930
Speaker 1:  will let you discover Android apps. And then when you go to download

483
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:55,830
Speaker 1:  one, from what we can tell, it will open Amazon

484
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,490
Speaker 1:  Android app store inside the windows store. We don't actually that's

485
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,430
Speaker 1:  unclear. Okay.

486
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They didn't actually really show it and they, they they're like, we're

487
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,300
Speaker 5:  not quite sure what it's going to look like. So

488
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,200
Speaker 1:  My guess is that there's a separate app, the Amazon Android

489
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,130
Speaker 1:  app. Yeah. That you have to install so that you'll discover the absence in

490
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,190
Speaker 1:  the windows store. And then when you go to download the Android app, you'll

491
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,430
Speaker 1:  open the Android app store and then that will download Android apps. And

492
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,270
Speaker 1:  then you will be able to just run Android apps on your windows PC.

493
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,600
Speaker 4:  Right? Oh, so it's discoverable in the ma in the Microsoft stores. Like you

494
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,000
Speaker 4:  can search for Tik TOK, it'll show you it. But then there's a button that

495
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,860
Speaker 4:  has a little arrow going away saying get from the Amazon store. So

496
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,030
Speaker 4:  is yeah. Yeah. And

497
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,990
Speaker 1:  Adela told me that if Google wants to participate, they would also support

498
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,980
Speaker 1:  the play store. What actions they've asked Google and

499
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,550
Speaker 1:  Google has declined to participate. Hence we have the Amazon app store,

500
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,450
Speaker 1:  which to be fair, has a bunch of stuff on it. It

501
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,780
Speaker 1:  does have TechTalk and Snapchat and all these things that people use on fire

502
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,530
Speaker 1:  tablets. For the most part, I think you can download the Amazon app

503
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,430
Speaker 1:  store on Google. You can like sideload it. No one uses it. Yeah.

504
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,240
Speaker 5:  It has a bunch of outdated Android apps. It's probably the best way to describe.

505
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,570
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well, so my hope is that maybe this will be the thing

506
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,530
Speaker 4:  that incentivizes developers to keep their apps on the Amazon

507
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,830
Speaker 4:  app store updated, or even submit them to the Amazon app store. And then

508
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,130
Speaker 4:  we might have some better app store competition on Android. That could be

509
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,630
Speaker 4:  interesting.

510
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:27,020
Speaker 1:  Yeah. We'll get to there in a second. So you download the, the example they

511
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,230
Speaker 1:  kept using was tick tock, right? Tectonics, very popular app Panisse went

512
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,800
Speaker 1:  so far as to claim it was his favorite app, which is hilarious. Moda

513
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,160
Speaker 1:  love to see what Pennys Penny's tick tock algorithm serves him

514
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,760
Speaker 1:  weightlifting because he's pumped. It's just designed for, you know, it's

515
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,220
Speaker 1:  just like close-ups of like chamfers and

516
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,180
Speaker 1:  hinges. That's a great Tik TOK feed. And I'd love to look at it.

517
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,750
Speaker 1:  And yeah, so you download tech doc in some convoluted way. It

518
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,470
Speaker 1:  delivers, it gets full windowing support on windows.

519
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,160
Speaker 1:  So you can like pin it to the side. He can stretch it. Most windows

520
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,000
Speaker 1:  computers are touchscreen. Like the ad that is coming is

521
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,960
Speaker 1:  somebody scrolling Tech-Talk on their laptop while doing work over

522
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,950
Speaker 1:  here. And of course, apple has no recourse for that because

523
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,920
Speaker 1:  they refused to put a touch screen on their laptops. I think that alone,

524
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,160
Speaker 1:  even if all you did this and it's kind of janky, but you get to make that

525
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,810
Speaker 1:  ad super worth

526
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,680
Speaker 5:  It. Yep, yep. Right. It is also Android mobile games as

527
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,400
Speaker 5:  well. Like there's a surprising amount of people who do actually want to

528
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,820
Speaker 5:  run those on, on their PCs that like carry on their gaming

529
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,300
Speaker 5:  session that they had on their phone and they just have it running on their

530
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,630
Speaker 5:  windows PC through like blue stacks and all those sorts of connectors. Yeah.

531
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,110
Speaker 5:  I could definitely see the value in it. And like, I think most people probably

532
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,520
Speaker 5:  don't really need Android apps on the PC, but there's some stuff

533
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,510
Speaker 5:  like home automation apps that just aren't available on

534
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,460
Speaker 5:  the web or on your desktop PC. So like there is, there's

535
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,230
Speaker 5:  some apps that you might, I'm sure everyone has one app that they would be

536
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,950
Speaker 5:  like, huh. Okay. That's kind of useful to have that on my

537
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,880
Speaker 5:  PC. It's just what is the app, but

538
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,660
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And is it available in the Amazon app store as opposed to Google

539
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,930
Speaker 1:  play? That's the big blocker, but again, a preview of the conversation with

540
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,930
Speaker 1:  on decoder, I was like, it's not great. Do you think he's good enough? He's

541
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,770
Speaker 1:  like, I hope that all gets better. Like if I go into it eyes

542
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,400
Speaker 1:  open, but they have this other avenue and he was like, it will be very interesting

543
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,350
Speaker 1:  to see if Google participates in there's competition between app stores.

544
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,210
Speaker 5:  So the big deal about this, not necessarily the Amazon app

545
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,270
Speaker 5:  store and all that sort of stuff. It's the pure fact that they've opened

546
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,480
Speaker 5:  up the app store to rival app stores essentially within their

547
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,290
Speaker 5:  store. So I spoke to panelists like moments ago about

548
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,280
Speaker 5:  this and he, he was basically open to like, you know, steam being their

549
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,090
Speaker 5:  epic games store being in there. It's like, they basically want the store

550
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,450
Speaker 5:  now to be the place where you get all of your apps, regardless of whether

551
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,750
Speaker 5:  you're getting them from the windows store or not. And like that's, that's

552
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,020
Speaker 5:  more of an interesting shift than even Android apps on windows, to be honest,

553
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,770
Speaker 5:  because that actually makes the store that much more interesting

554
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,760
Speaker 5:  and useful. And you know, the center, the center to get all your apps.

555
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,540
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I want

556
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,290
Speaker 4:  To wrap up Android one last thing, which is why not side load. You can install

557
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,440
Speaker 4:  Android apps directly just like you can any other app on a windows PC. So

558
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,040
Speaker 4:  maybe that'll be open and that'll be a fun world of piracy to think about

559
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,850
Speaker 4:  on the app store. If they can succeed even a

560
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,540
Speaker 4:  little in getting other app stores to participate, even just a little flag

561
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,020
Speaker 4:  that says I have installed these things so that I can have one

562
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,740
Speaker 4:  place on windows where what I set up a new PC, it could be.

563
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,160
Speaker 4:  Yep. Re-install these things that would be so

564
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,910
Speaker 4:  nice. That's all I want. I don't want to have to keep a doc. I keep a

565
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:36,420
Speaker 4:  notepad document. That's like all the stuff that I installed on a windows

566
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,600
Speaker 4:  computer. And just like, when I set a new one up, I just like go down the

567
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,180
Speaker 4:  checkbox tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. Yeah.

568
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,080
Speaker 1:  I think the other, the other thing that Android apps in particular is

569
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,200
Speaker 1:  unclear how well they're going to run, right? I mean, some big question.

570
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,160
Speaker 1:  These things are designed for the most part for arm processors,

571
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,030
Speaker 1:  particularly Qualcomm arm processors. The vast majority of

572
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,390
Speaker 1:  windows PC is run x86 processors from

573
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,290
Speaker 1:  Intel and AMD. Microsoft has been talking about the fact

574
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,070
Speaker 1:  that Intel bridge is the reason they're using this. That led a lot of

575
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,100
Speaker 1:  people to wonder this was Intel. Only Microsoft has since

576
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,850
Speaker 1:  clarified. It we'll work on Intel AMD and arm

577
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,750
Speaker 1:  processors. And Intel is like, oh, it's just a technology, but it'll work

578
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,470
Speaker 1:  best with Intel processors. So we'll see, we don't really

579
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,250
Speaker 1:  know what the CPU requirements are. And

580
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,060
Speaker 1:  we've just been told that like the real big constraint here is Ram. It's

581
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,840
Speaker 1:  an interesting thing to have been told as directly as I was told it. So we'll

582
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,710
Speaker 1:  just see like iOS apps on M one max are

583
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,420
Speaker 1:  not the greatest in the world. And that's the same

584
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,350
Speaker 1:  processor architecture. Literally the same processor is as the iPad.

585
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,950
Speaker 1:  There's just a lot to sort out here and all these developers have to

586
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,340
Speaker 1:  participate. They have to be in the Amazon app store and they have to decide

587
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,430
Speaker 1:  that they want to distribute to windows. So, yep. They got ticked off to

588
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:59,330
Speaker 1:  do it. But to Tom's point that huge long tail of Android

589
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:03,320
Speaker 1:  apps, all of those developers have to want this distribution. I think Microsoft's

590
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,740
Speaker 1:  argument is why wouldn't you want to distribute to another billion

591
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,610
Speaker 1:  devices? Just go get them. That's a reasonably good argument.

592
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:14,570
Speaker 1:  But as with everything we have to get it, we have to try it to see how

593
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,700
Speaker 1:  it actually works.

594
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,700
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And then there's obviously the benefits for Amazon partnering with

595
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,180
Speaker 5:  them here is that they're going to get probably more

596
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,110
Speaker 5:  developers put in their apps over, right? Like there's going to be some percentage

597
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,680
Speaker 5:  of, of developers that will do that now. Whereas they probably wouldn't have

598
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,130
Speaker 5:  before, but like, it really does depend on the apps. I think home

599
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,760
Speaker 5:  automation apps are the other key, last stuff like ring

600
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,790
Speaker 5:  and all this sort of apps. But like beyond

601
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:43,390
Speaker 5:  that, I don't know. Like it's not something that I'm

602
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:47,320
Speaker 5:  like dying from windows. Like I do most of my work in

603
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,590
Speaker 5:  the browser and I think that's the same for, for a lot of people now. So

604
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:50,830
Speaker 5:  that's

605
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,740
Speaker 1:  Why Microsoft, you know, even when they talked about app support, it was

606
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,610
Speaker 1:  never just about Android apps. It was universal windows apps, regular windows

607
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,210
Speaker 1:  apps, progressive web apps and Android apps. Like that was the list they

608
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,990
Speaker 1:  kept on saying, cause they're like, we kind of don't care. We just want you

609
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,190
Speaker 1:  to use windows.

610
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:10,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I think if you can get all of those into the store in, in a coherent

611
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,750
Speaker 5:  way that like makes sense. Like if I, if I go in search for, I don't

612
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,530
Speaker 5:  know, Fortnite, and then, and then I searched for it in the windows store,

613
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:21,160
Speaker 5:  I click a button and it pulls me into the epic games. Still great. Like,

614
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,120
Speaker 5:  yeah, yeah, that's fine. Like, it's like, it's a little bit of a janky experience,

615
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,780
Speaker 5:  but like, that's kind of fine. Like, you know, that is kind of

616
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,020
Speaker 5:  windows. I prefer that to like, having to

617
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,830
Speaker 5:  think where is fortnight installed or like w

618
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,490
Speaker 5:  what vulture have I got to use to get to that, to update it or to launch

619
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:42,970
Speaker 5:  it, whatever. So I think if they can pull it

620
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,690
Speaker 5:  off and be open in the process, which it seems like they

621
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,450
Speaker 5:  are like, yeah, that's, that's good news for people who use windows. For

622
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,020
Speaker 5:  sure,

623
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,200
Speaker 4:  Tom, how I'm going to hold myself back from talking about progressive web

624
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,440
Speaker 4:  apps. You're welcome. How big a deal is it? Do you think that they're opening

625
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,220
Speaker 4:  it up to like 1 32 and just like any app that runs on windows it's hap we're

626
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,860
Speaker 4:  happy to have it in her store. They're gonna, you know, I'm sure they're

627
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,850
Speaker 4:  going to have some requirements about, I dunno, some content stuff, no Nazis,

628
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,850
Speaker 4:  no porn or whatever, but other like, from a technical perspective, they're

629
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,380
Speaker 4:  like, yeah, come one, come all.

630
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,230
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like that's another big part of this. Right? Cause when he first launched

631
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:17,850
Speaker 5:  the store, you couldn't have Chrome in there. So everyone was like, okay,

632
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:21,190
Speaker 5:  number one, browser. I can't get it. And you're gonna force me to use edge,

633
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,740
Speaker 5:  which is obviously edge is better now, but it wasn't then there wasn't

634
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,630
Speaker 5:  iTunes, which obviously doesn't matter now, but it did then. And

635
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,260
Speaker 5:  it's just like opening it up to all these apps. Adobe creative suite is not

636
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,890
Speaker 5:  in the store slate. If you want to get Photoshop, you get like some touch

637
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:39,810
Speaker 5:  version or like some really lightweight version that let's be honest,

638
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,530
Speaker 5:  nobody really uses do they, they just go for the full, full version of

639
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,490
Speaker 5:  Photoshop or windows. So like having that stuff there is,

640
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:51,480
Speaker 5:  is, yeah, like that's, it, it goes to your point again, like you have

641
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,260
Speaker 5:  a list of apps, you used all on new windows device, right? Like,

642
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,380
Speaker 5:  and all of those apps, you have to go search out onto the web to like find

643
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,250
Speaker 5:  them and stuff. And it's just centralizing it in one location where it should

644
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:02,820
Speaker 5:  be.

645
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,420
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Let's, let's take a break right there because there's some big

646
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,930
Speaker 1:  business side stuff to why Adobe chose to be in that

647
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:13,080
Speaker 1:  store that we need to talk about at length. But we got to take a break. We'll

648
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,290
Speaker 1:  be right

649
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:17,660
Speaker 1:  back.

650
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,320
Speaker ?:  Let's get real the tech world. Doesn't always like to keep it simple from

651
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,010
Speaker ?:  over-hype products to constant sales pitches and endless jargon shopping

652
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:28,910
Speaker ?:  for quality electronics can be overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be

653
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,540
Speaker ?:  cut through the usual BS with high sense, high census, the straight talking

654
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,020
Speaker ?:  electronics brand that offers clarity and quality over confusion because

655
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,980
Speaker ?:  let's get real. The most important thing about a great TV is that it's actually

656
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,550

00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:27,050
Speaker ?:  support is something no one has ever said bad. Customer support experience

Speaker ?:  customers prefer to use search on a company's website to resolve their support

671
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,820
Speaker ?:  issues swiftly and independently, but not if that means sorting through a

672
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:41,210

674
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,380

680
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,910
Speaker 1:  Okay, we're back. So Tom, you were just talking about creative

681
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,240
Speaker 1:  cloud in the windows store. Adobe is they're not

682
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,080
Speaker 1:  there wacky touch versions. You're talking about maybe the

683
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,040
Speaker 1:  epic store will be there. Kind of a huge point of emphasis

684
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,950
Speaker 1:  for Microsoft for Nadella around

685
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,800
Speaker 1:  windows is that it's a platform for other

686
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,130
Speaker 1:  platforms and a huge term in the store that they are

687
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,060
Speaker 1:  changing. Is there cut if you choose

688
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,890
Speaker 1:  to use their payment processing, all that stuff is 15% now.

689
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,820
Speaker 1:  So instead of the 70 30, that we've just heard about endlessly with apple

690
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,740
Speaker 1:  and Google and whoever else, Microsoft is going to fly 85 15,

691
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,860
Speaker 1:  and then you can just not use it. So you don't have to use their

692
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,490
Speaker 1:  payment systems or whatever. You can put your apps in the store, use your

693
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,480
Speaker 1:  own payment. And obviously the 0% you're responsible for whatever

694
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,750
Speaker 1:  costs of rolling your own payment solution, which is why

695
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,470
Speaker 1:  Adobe is putting creative cloud in the store.

696
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:05,250
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So, so there's a, there's a few things to this. So the 85,

697
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,300
Speaker 5:  15 split for apps has always been there from the windows

698
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,290
Speaker 5:  store, but like apps like creative suite just wouldn't, wouldn't

699
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,620
Speaker 5:  go for it. And not necessarily for the revenue split, but also just because

700
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,680
Speaker 5:  they couldn't have their own updater in there. So they couldn't control how

701
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,550
Speaker 5:  all their apps updated. So like that's also a part of it, but it's also

702
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:27,150
Speaker 5:  like the split between apps and games is really like

703
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,600
Speaker 5:  apparent here. So, so it's 85, 15 for apps,

704
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,680
Speaker 5:  88, 12 for games, which is coming in August, which they've

705
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,640
Speaker 5:  already announced. So they're pulling it back a bit, but if you want to

706
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,360
Speaker 5:  use the in app purchase system, so if you're fortnight and you want to be

707
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,140
Speaker 5:  in the windows store that doesn't apply like that free

708
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,130
Speaker 5:  open approach doesn't apply to games. Right? So it's only

709
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,940
Speaker 5:  for apps CA works great for like creative suite,

710
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,150
Speaker 5:  whatever. I'm trying to think of other sort of subscription based apps on

711
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,750
Speaker 5:  windows. But like for those sorts of apps, it works fine. But for

712
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,620
Speaker 5:  games, which is really where revenues generated in these stores, no,

713
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,170
Speaker 5:  like you have to use Microsoft's payment processing platform

714
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,700
Speaker 4:  Draws a similar line on the play store actually have different rules for

715
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,400
Speaker 4:  games and they do for everything else.

716
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,130
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like that's, that's literally where people spend their money, right?

717
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,020
Speaker 5:  Like it's not many apps that people,

718
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,300
Speaker 1:  Another decade of asking what is a game

719
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,170
Speaker 1:  is right. But this is because

720
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,890
Speaker 1:  we know that the vast majority of the revenue for all these stores is in

721
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:32,370
Speaker 1:  app purchases in games like candy crush and whatever. They're not going to

722
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,700
Speaker 1:  turn away from that. And the game developers except for

723
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,620
Speaker 1:  epic are generally like, yeah, we're making a lot of money. Like let's just

724
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,110
Speaker 1:  pay some of it to the app store is because this is our whole business model

725
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,890
Speaker 1:  it's baked in. Whereas companies like Adobe and others, like,

726
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:50,580
Speaker 1:  what are you even doing for us? We don't want to pay you this money. We'd

727
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,940
Speaker 1:  rather just run our own, our own stack and be okay with it.

728
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,510
Speaker 4:  What do you make? Devil's advocate of the argument that what, the, another

729
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,540
Speaker 4:  reason that games have different rules is they're also like the place where

730
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,110
Speaker 4:  most of the like fraud and dark patterns to trick kids

731
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:08,100
Speaker 4:  into making purchases happens. And so forcing games to go through the

732
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,700
Speaker 4:  app store system means that they can provide a little bit more

733
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,660
Speaker 4:  protection to consumers. I'm like 50 50 on that at best.

734
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,050
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Put on windows. It doesn't matter. Like, yeah, that's right. There's

735
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,680
Speaker 1:  just like, there's also the wild west and other games towards them, whatever

736
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,640
Speaker 1:  else have you, what you're really getting is again, I asked them like,

737
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,760
Speaker 1:  what do you got for your 15%? And he was like, you get discovery, you get

738
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,140
Speaker 1:  promotion, you get all this stuff. Microsoft will provide, which is the right

739
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,100
Speaker 1:  way to think about it. And I don't feel like that's kind of what apple

740
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,090
Speaker 1:  says, right? Like we bring the customers to you, but

741
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:44,840
Speaker 1:  they're also the only way that you can get customers for an iOS app. So it

742
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,680
Speaker 1:  just rings hollow. Whereas Microsoft is like, pay us the money. And then

743
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,190
Speaker 1:  over time you can evaluate whether you think that money is worth it and

744
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:55,520
Speaker 1:  leave if you don't think so, which I think is just a much healthier

745
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,970
Speaker 1:  dynamic for the stores. Like it'll put pressure on Microsoft to actually

746
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,840
Speaker 1:  deliver discovery and users and all that stuff in a way that apple

747
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,770
Speaker 1:  clearly doesn't feel any pressure to do. That's Dieter.

748
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:10,400
Speaker 1:  You wrote about this, like that's kind of where Nadella ended the whole event,

749
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,330
Speaker 1:  right? Just talking about how open windows is talking about being a

750
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:18,170
Speaker 1:  platform for platforms. I think you and I read it the same way or listened

751
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,620
Speaker 1:  or heard it the same way. Then he wrote about it that, well, that's a lot

752
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,380
Speaker 1:  of direct shots at apple.

753
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,260
Speaker 4:  It was a lot of direct shots at apple. This is the part where I get to talk

754
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,170
Speaker 4:  about Arthur Schopenhauer. I'm not actually going to do that, but he did

755
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,470
Speaker 4:  quote this like random philosopher who believes

756
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:36,340
Speaker 4:  that nothing is real and everything only exists. If you perceive it

757
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,550
Speaker 4:  yourself, I'm not going to go there. He caught him at the end. It's like,

758
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,980
Speaker 4:  you know, there are some creators that are meteors and they flame out on

759
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,850
Speaker 4:  there. Some creators that are stars that own a permanent place in the firmament

760
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:49,720
Speaker 4:  of the galaxy. And that's what we want to do is we want to make stars

761
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,470
Speaker 4:  very, very soaring. But leading up to that, he said some stuff

762
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,890
Speaker 4:  that like, here's a, here's the, here's a line that alludes to it. Ben

763
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:00,430
Speaker 4:  Thompson windows has always stood for sovereignty for

764
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:04,240
Speaker 4:  creators and agency for consumers. And

765
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,080
Speaker 4:  on both of those fronts, those are shots that apple agency for

766
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,290
Speaker 4:  consumers, she's got some stuff about like, you can build your own

767
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:15,160
Speaker 4:  PC. You can, it's your PC. You have agency over what happens

768
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,000
Speaker 4:  on it. You could choose what it does. It's yours not controlled by us. And

769
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,960
Speaker 4:  then on like sovereignty for creators, it's like creators are able to

770
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,990
Speaker 4:  like be in control of their own destiny and not have the money that they

771
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:29,590
Speaker 4:  make come through, you know, app store

772
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,740
Speaker 4:  fees. Although maybe if you use our direct tipping feature,

773
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,430
Speaker 4:  maybe cause you can get paid and Microsoft points in their new direct tipping

774
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:36,970
Speaker 4:  feature.

775
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:40,210
Speaker 1:  It's like amazing. If you're a local journalist and you get paid in Microsoft

776
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,420
Speaker 1:  YNC, I would be so mad. Oh man, I'd be so mad.

777
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,630
Speaker 5:  You could buy an export series X and then put it on.

778
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,440
Speaker 6:  I can't. Yeah.

779
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,100
Speaker 4:  Yeah. He's got like lines, like windows recognizes. There is no personal

780
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,820
Speaker 4:  computing without personal agency. Personal computing

781
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,750
Speaker 4:  requires choice. Like tell me that's not a giant

782
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,280
Speaker 4:  shot at apple. Yeah.

783
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,130
Speaker 1:  And this thing about sovereign craters and owning your own business, like,

784
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,200
Speaker 1:  okay, here's the cynical read.

785
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Oh yeah. I definitely share this. Yeah. The obvious

786
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,190
Speaker 1:  Cynical read, which is no one uses this app store. Yup. Until this

787
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,090
Speaker 1:  pandemic, we know it was an afterthought. Even for Microsoft, they've

788
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,540
Speaker 1:  got a big opportunity with soaring, laptop

789
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,200
Speaker 1:  sales and work from home. And everybody re

790
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,070
Speaker 1:  to attract developers to say, you're mad

791
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:34,050
Speaker 1:  at apple, come on home, come on home to windows. Here's a

792
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:37,560
Speaker 1:  billion users here into be the more open

793
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,950
Speaker 1:  platform because that's how you compete against the dominant closed

794
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:44,670
Speaker 1:  platform. Right. Which is exactly what apple did to

795
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,600
Speaker 1:  Microsoft in the early two thousands. Right?

796
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,200
Speaker 1:  Like Microsoft was the big dominant platform with all the antitrust scrutiny

797
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,100
Speaker 1:  and all the bullshit. And apple was like, our computer runs a Unix.

798
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,640
Speaker 1:  Our computer is good at the open web. It's so good at the open web that we

799
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,880
Speaker 1:  actually let Microsoft put internet Explorer on it. Cause that's what y'all

800
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,810
Speaker 1:  motherfuckers want to use. Apple, the Unix computer, that's

801
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,530
Speaker 1:  easy to use like straight up. That's what they said to developers and all

802
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:14,430
Speaker 1:  this web development moved to apple. Now Microsoft it's like Linux

803
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,360
Speaker 1:  runs on windows. First-class citizen, Android runs on windows, just

804
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,290
Speaker 1:  another Linux. Really also our store terms are easy. Like don't you want

805
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:26,070
Speaker 1:  to be here where everything works and everyone's happy. And also you definitely

806
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,710
Speaker 1:  have to have a Microsoft account to use windows. And we're definitely just

807
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,230
Speaker 1:  sort of doing telematics someone who's alive. Nevermind. Don't worry about

808
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,710
Speaker 1:  that. Right? Like that's the super cynical read of

809
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,340
Speaker 1:  this. I think the other read of it is, and

810
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,940
Speaker 1:  Nutella alluded this to, in his remarks and he said it on decoder, which

811
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,660
Speaker 1:  is, this is always what windows has been. Windows is where the

812
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,560
Speaker 1:  other biggest software businesses in the world have come up to some extent.

813
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,160
Speaker 1:  He even tried to take credit for the web on windows or some areas given all

814
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,910
Speaker 1:  the antitrust battles they faced. But he's like SAP was built in, born on

815
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,180
Speaker 1:  windows. That's a huge software company and we have no pardon. They just

816
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,960
Speaker 1:  run their apps on windows. There's a tension there. Like, I don't

817
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,320
Speaker 1:  know if the idealism versus the cynicism, like what the right ratio

818
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,090
Speaker 1:  is, but it's, it's both to some extent. Right?

819
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:11,330
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

820
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:15,230
Speaker 5:  And it's, it's, it's also windows was the default for so many years

821
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,830
Speaker 5:  right. On the desktop. So like of course SAP would have been built on that

822
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:22,640
Speaker 5:  and like PC gaming is built on top of that and it's

823
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,330
Speaker 5:  it. And I think the problem with windows is that yes, it's great. And it's

824
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:30,260
Speaker 5:  been open and like kinda Della can take credit for some of that if, if

825
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,980
Speaker 5:  he wants. But the problem with it now is that it's, it's escaped their

826
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,580
Speaker 5:  control in a way. And so they've tried all these different ways to

827
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:41,450
Speaker 5:  like bring the control of windows back and it hasn't really worked. So now

828
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,870
Speaker 5:  they've just been like, all right, we're open again. Yeah. So that

829
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,710
Speaker 1:  List is like, we know windows 10 S all the modes they've done, they

830
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:52,250
Speaker 4:  Went from windows S mode to windows, shrug, whatever, do what you

831
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,650
Speaker 4:  want

832
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,990
Speaker 5:  Love to have had the app model that apple has, right. Like that

833
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:00,260
Speaker 5:  control. Yeah. They tried and they failed. It's failed. And they've had,

834
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,990
Speaker 5:  they've had to be open. They've had to embrace this openness, which has been

835
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:06,980
Speaker 5:  great for them, like as a, as a company. And like for consumers is

836
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,670
Speaker 5:  great. Right. They've turned windows into an actual dev box that

837
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:14,270
Speaker 5:  developers aren't like laughing at. They're like, oh, well it does all this

838
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:18,170
Speaker 5:  stuff. Okay. Maybe I'll maybe I'll get one. And

839
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:21,830
Speaker 5:  it, yeah, just the open approaches is obviously for the best

840
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:24,830
Speaker 5:  bit it's differently because they've had to,

841
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:28,430
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, I wrote that the underdogs always agitate for openness. That's

842
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:31,450
Speaker 4:  always how it works. Then when they become top dog, they close it up again.

843
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:35,320
Speaker 4:  But the other thing is like, it doesn't cost Microsoft anything to do this.

844
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,140
Speaker 4:  They get, they get the, have the easy shots at apple during the, all

845
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:43,030
Speaker 4:  this antitrust scrutiny. And it's not like their stores were successful in

846
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,640
Speaker 4:  the first place. So they're not losing anything by saying, come on, come

847
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,480
Speaker 4:  on. They're losing like potential future revenue. Maybe if they

848
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,780
Speaker 4:  figured out a way to turn it around, but they're probably not gonna. So they're

849
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,770
Speaker 4:  just going to stop trying take the easy, cheap wins now,

850
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,100
Speaker 4:  rhetorically against apple or whatever, and maybe build up some Goodwill

851
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,670
Speaker 4:  if people come to do it. And as far as the idealism versus cynicism

852
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:07,300
Speaker 4:  thing, I think the answer is yes, like in the same way

853
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,050
Speaker 4:  that Google is a, you know, their business

854
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,840
Speaker 4:  model is based on the web and based on advertising. And do they care about

855
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,090
Speaker 4:  privacy or they care about advertising? It's like, well, they're try to do

856
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:18,940
Speaker 4:  both. And when apple starts locking things down, it's like, why are they

857
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,190
Speaker 4:  locking things down? Cause they care about privacy. Are they locking things

858
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,980
Speaker 4:  down? Because you know, it's good for their business model that everybody

859
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,640
Speaker 4:  has to pay for stuff directly through their bottles. It's like, well, yes,

860
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,570
Speaker 4:  it's, it is possible for their philosophy and their business

861
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:35,560
Speaker 4:  model and the way they make their products to like all come together. And

862
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,230
Speaker 4:  I think that's kind of what's happening here. And there's definitely some

863
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:42,220
Speaker 4:  cynicism to think about with it, but you know, not so

864
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,560
Speaker 4:  much that like you should take advantage of the things that they're giving

865
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,480
Speaker 4:  you, you know, because they're cynical, you know what I mean? Yeah. I

866
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,990
Speaker 1:  Also said that on Dakota, he was like other companies do things for different

867
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,380
Speaker 1:  reasons and they're internally consistent for why they do them, but this

868
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,530
Speaker 1:  is our choice and we feel internally consistent about it. And I think part

869
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:02,310
Speaker 1:  of that is, you know, three years ago or whatever,

870
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:06,270
Speaker 1:  he, he was like, we could just rename windows Azure edge, but no

871
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:10,260
Speaker 1:  one's going to let me, and he's saying windows is not,

872
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,100
Speaker 1:  the operating system is not the most important layer for us. And I

873
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,500
Speaker 1:  think that's still true. He basically said, yeah, that's still basic. That's

874
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,010
Speaker 1:  still true for us. Right? Like Azure in our services,

875
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:23,910
Speaker 1:  businesses are the big businesses and they deploy to windows and the

876
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:27,000
Speaker 1:  windows team relies on the fact that we run a huge cloud platform to do a

877
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,750
Speaker 1:  bunch of stuff. And it's all one thing. And I don't have to make money on

878
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,510
Speaker 1:  windows, the way that we used to. And he's like other companies make money

879
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,720
Speaker 1:  in different ways and it leads them to different results. And I think that's,

880
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,680
Speaker 1:  you can feel about that a million different ways. Like at the same

881
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,640
Speaker 1:  time we're talking about anti-trust and browsers and defaults and other platforms

882
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,790
Speaker 1:  working on it. Microsoft is like, teams is in the start

883
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:51,420
Speaker 1:  button, right? Teams is everywhere now.

884
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,410
Speaker 1:  Like we're going to make teams, the default communication app for business

885
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:59,400
Speaker 1:  as aggressively as we can, because that's the future of Microsoft's

886
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,270
Speaker 1:  like workplace productivity business, and they're going to be aggressive

887
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:07,260
Speaker 1:  about it. But at the same time, if they are going to be idealistic, they

888
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,740
Speaker 1:  have to let you replace it. Right. And if it's not easy to get rid of all

889
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,950
Speaker 1:  the teams, buttons are in place, some of the slack buttons or whatever, but

890
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:17,250
Speaker 1:  I think they open themselves up to some criticism. So we'll see. But I think

891
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:20,940
Speaker 1:  you're right Teeter, like at the end of the day, there's one major

892
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,150
Speaker 1:  commercial operating system that lets you build your own

893
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:27,740
Speaker 1:  hardware that lets you run almost anything on it from a variety

894
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:31,490
Speaker 1:  of sources too. Once you touch the fucking

895
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,480
Speaker 1:  street, that's kind of

896
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,900
Speaker 1:  remarkable that Microsoft is positioning itself right there.

897
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,510
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And it's Linux, right? It's

898
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,380
Speaker 1:  Linux, windows is Lennox now. Right? It's like Jamie

899
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,300
Speaker 1:  love to say, I

900
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,000
Speaker 5:  Absolutely think like everything they've done in windows 11,

901
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,710
Speaker 5:  everything they've showed today goes back to that thing. I'm sure it's

902
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:56,620
Speaker 5:  Nadella said it, that they wanted windows to be

903
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,520
Speaker 5:  loved. Like they want people to, and they've realized it during the

904
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,880
Speaker 5:  pandemic. Well, so they say like, you know, people using it more, but they

905
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,630
Speaker 5:  want to keep people hooked on windows because they know like where

906
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,470
Speaker 5:  computing is going. Like they know that they're building it, right? Like

907
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:13,990
Speaker 5:  cloud computing, everyone working in their browser is slowly

908
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,990
Speaker 5:  becoming it. We're not even slowly. It's just rapidly becoming

909
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,350
Speaker 5:  like a thing. And it's like, they want

910
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:23,740
Speaker 5:  people to move into the cloud, wanting

911
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:27,610
Speaker 5:  windows and wanting that flexibility so that if you

912
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:30,670
Speaker 5:  are going to work in a browser and they're going to stream that copy of windows

913
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,240
Speaker 5:  to that browser, you'll have all of your familiar controls, all the

914
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,480
Speaker 5:  stuff, you know, your apps are in the store, all that sort of stuff.

915
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,320
Speaker 5:  Like it's definitely about keeping people on windows now that they've got

916
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,300
Speaker 5:  a bit of a taste for it during the pandemic and also just, you know,

917
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,230
Speaker 5:  just getting them to rely on it more.

918
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,630
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I think one interesting. You mentioned streaming windows. Like they're

919
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:54,400
Speaker 1:  streaming, Xbox. Yeah. Like Microsoft's bet on if

920
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,000
Speaker 1:  you can stream it, you should over, you can

921
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,870
Speaker 1:  deliver it via the cloud. You should will eventually turn its

922
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,550
Speaker 1:  weight. Yeah. Like

923
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,160
Speaker 5:  There's, there's a stop. And I can't remember the name of it right now, but

924
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,700
Speaker 5:  like I joked about it on Twitter a few months ago. It's just the browser

925
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,540
Speaker 5:  one. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, when you think about it, like when you

926
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,380
Speaker 5:  initially look at it and you react to it, you think why would I pay 10 bucks

927
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:21,370
Speaker 5:  a month for a browser? And then when you think about the way things

928
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:24,790
Speaker 5:  are heading and the fact that people were picking up these old laptops, they

929
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:27,430
Speaker 5:  haven't used for years. And they're like trying to work during a pandemic

930
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:30,880
Speaker 5:  and trying to buy a new laptop and all that sort of stuff. It's like offering

931
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,510
Speaker 5:  them the power of an actual browser that works that just stream straight

932
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:37,390
Speaker 5:  to their computer is actually a way better experience than trying to use

933
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:40,810
Speaker 5:  the browser themselves. So like that, that that's, that is a way that we're

934
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,960
Speaker 5:  kind of heading with computing is especially when everything's contained

935
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,170
Speaker 5:  within the browser. Now

936
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,820
Speaker 1:  What Thomas talking about is called the mighty browser. It just runs criminal

937
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,670
Speaker 1:  cloud and streams to you. And every time I've looked at it, I'm like, I'm

938
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:55,450
Speaker 1:  not letting this startup have my browsing

939
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:58,890
Speaker 1:  history. And it's like five years now. Am I going to feel the same way? Like

940
00:52:58,890 --> 00:52:59,860
Speaker 1:  I dunno, like everything

941
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,100
Speaker 6:  Else has changed. Other Google have my browsing

942
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,390
Speaker 6:  history.

943
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:08,320
Speaker 5:  It seems crazy right now. But like genuinely think that's the way we're

944
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,950
Speaker 5:  heading. And there there'll be some I'm sure

945
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:15,700
Speaker 5:  Google would do some really interesting stuff around it. Particularly, and

946
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,460
Speaker 5:  Microsoft knows where it's heading. Like they know that they're building

947
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,880
Speaker 5:  a similar sort of service themselves, a cloud PC service. So they know

948
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:25,590
Speaker 1:  Fascinating. But all that is nothing happens in a vacuum.

949
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:29,190
Speaker 1:  Like Microsoft is here, positioning itself as the

950
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:33,180
Speaker 1:  champion of openness and developers and creators. Meanwhile, Apple's

951
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,720
Speaker 1:  like putting out white papers about why sideloading would be dangerous on

952
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,470
Speaker 1:  the iPhone. It's like a long, it's like a

953
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,890
Speaker 1:  brochure. I didn't even know how to describe this document. It has like flat

954
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:47,340
Speaker 1:  illustrations. It looks like one of those videos from when you sign up for

955
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:50,850
Speaker 1:  a bank or whatever, it's like, you like hit play. And it's like a bunch of

956
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:54,750
Speaker 1:  flat graphics of like cartoon people like saving one

957
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:58,260
Speaker 1:  penny a day. Like it's got that startup graphic

958
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:02,190
Speaker 1:  design, but then it's like, pirates will steal your phone

959
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:04,970
Speaker 1:  if sideloading is loud. It's like, this is so in Congress,

960
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:08,240
Speaker 5:  If you don't know how to describe it, Tim Sweeney has a bunch of disparity,

961
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,140
Speaker 5:  descriptive tweets about it

962
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:16,100
Speaker 4:  And certainly regress. Sorry. Did you see what 10 sweetie just tweeted about

963
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,780
Speaker 4:  the app stuff today. He said, and I quote the 20, 21

964
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:23,300
Speaker 4:  version of Microsoft is the best version of Microsoft ever

965
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,470
Speaker 4:  exclamation point. Yeah. Didn't

966
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,320
Speaker 1:  He retweeted you saying

967
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,250
Speaker 1:  noodles.

968
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:35,150
Speaker 1:  So he's happy with Microsoft. It's a big epic partner, right? They like

969
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:38,870
Speaker 1:  run on the Xbox at the trial with apple. He was saying

970
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:41,930
Speaker 1:  like, we get value from this relationship. We're happy with this cut. We

971
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:45,920
Speaker 1:  understand it. We're able to negotiate around it, blah, blah, blah.

972
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,040
Speaker 1:  And then obviously if they do the epic store with the Microsoft

973
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,730
Speaker 1:  store, there's a lot of opportunity for him there. And Srini

974
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:56,150
Speaker 5:  Was on stage when he first sort of started talking about this open store

975
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:59,990
Speaker 5:  model, which was with HoloLens to a few years ago now. So

976
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:03,860
Speaker 5:  like it's been building to this point, for sure. I don't

977
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:07,700
Speaker 5:  doubt that he's happy after the WP era. And he was

978
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,280
Speaker 5:  not very happy about UWP. So,

979
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,370
Speaker 1:  But it was him seeing his quote about the apple graphic

980
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:16,460
Speaker 1:  was the epic games store. Doesn't have a shopping cart. It ought to have

981
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,550
Speaker 1:  a shopping cart someday. It will. But in the meantime we don't put out graphical

982
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,580
Speaker 1:  pamphlets, decrying the ills of shopping carts it's

983
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:26,570
Speaker 1:  absurd. And then he was like, there's a clear difference between

984
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:30,560
Speaker 1:  our 1984 Fortnite campaign and Apple's open platforms or the devil

985
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,440
Speaker 1:  PDF. One is a work of fiction. And the other is a

986
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,370
Speaker 1:  fortnight. That's funny. Good.

987
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:41,210
Speaker 1:  This is like a huge, huge reversal in this industry, right?

988
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:45,140
Speaker 1:  Apple's like Congress right now is marking up antitrust

989
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,560
Speaker 1:  bills. McKenna has been watching this endless markup, the

990
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,280
Speaker 1:  exited committee to go into the floor, largely intact,

991
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,970
Speaker 1:  largely intact. There's some minor changes, but congratulations to

992
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:59,750
Speaker 1:  McKenna for washing all this. They went into like three or four in the

993
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:03,470
Speaker 1:  morning and then started again today. She a hero over a reporter for

994
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:07,370
Speaker 1:  watching all this. But as theater said, all five out of committee

995
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:11,360
Speaker 1:  under the hustler, largely intact focused at apple and Amazon

996
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,140
Speaker 1:  and Google and Facebook in Dallas said, if you know these bills pass, Microsoft

997
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,980
Speaker 1:  will certainly feel the effects. But it's crazy that like

998
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:22,220
Speaker 1:  apple is a target of all of this congressional ire in

999
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:25,660
Speaker 1:  controversy for being a bullying, monopolist and

1000
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,960
Speaker 1:  Microsoft like anything. What

1001
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,950
Speaker 1:  goes, if you told me it's 20 years, I

1002
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,320
Speaker 1:  just would not have believed you. Yeah.

1003
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:38,280
Speaker 5:  It's everything's flipped upside down. And it's this world

1004
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:38,910
Speaker 5:  Google is

1005
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:42,630
Speaker 1:  Considering letting like media apps like video music or book

1006
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:46,590
Speaker 1:  apps get around the 30%. Like, yeah, it is amazing.

1007
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:49,260
Speaker 1:  What, a little bit of controversy and a little bit of regular, like even

1008
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,950
Speaker 1:  the threat of regulations. Oh, we should maybe stop it so much.

1009
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,880
Speaker 1:  So let's finish on with, love it. And we got a lightning round of gadgets.

1010
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,720
Speaker 1:  Do Tom, what are the minimum system requirements? And when does windows 11

1011
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,380
Speaker 1:  hit

1012
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:05,370
Speaker 5:  The minimum system requirements are four gig of Ram 64 gig

1013
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:09,360
Speaker 5:  of storage and a 64 bit processor. So

1014
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,930
Speaker 5:  nothing too crazy there that the actual, like, I wouldn't say crazy, but

1015
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:16,410
Speaker 5:  like the surprising element of it is that you need a TPM 2.0

1016
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:20,280
Speaker 5:  chip, and that has caused some controversy, but we kind of

1017
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,060
Speaker 5:  talked about that earlier is it shouldn't be too much of a thing. You just

1018
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,120
Speaker 5:  have to make sure that it's actually enabled in your bios. So

1019
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,940
Speaker 4:  There is one more system requirement to talk about, which is, if you have

1020
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,390
Speaker 4:  windows 11 home edition, you also need a internet connection.

1021
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:37,110
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Just for the setup. Yeah. She's

1022
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,720
Speaker 4:  still, yeah. Yeah,

1023
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,290
Speaker 5:  Because that is obviously there to force you to use a Microsoft

1024
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:46,830
Speaker 5:  account, which is like, no, Cartano when you set it up

1025
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:47,760
Speaker 5:  anymore.

1026
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,430
Speaker 6:  Thank God. There's some wifi

1027
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:53,520
Speaker 6:  here.

1028
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,150
Speaker 5:  Know that is an unfortunate part of windows 11 and also the

1029
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:00,810
Speaker 5:  widget stuff. Where in that leaked build, it forces you into

1030
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,770
Speaker 5:  edge. We still don't know. Cause obviously the build isn't out yet. But

1031
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:07,350
Speaker 5:  if they've, if they're going down that route as well, like those are two

1032
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,060
Speaker 5:  unfortunate things.

1033
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:13,050
Speaker 1:  Well, this is why you have five antitrust spills, right? I mean,

1034
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,950
Speaker 1:  this is a source of a word, like a big knock on those bills is

1035
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:19,110
Speaker 1:  what we're talking about in the next time we put a big knock on this bills

1036
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:22,500
Speaker 1:  is it's not clear what they're going to cause.

1037
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,490
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So we just started out. But that's presumably that sort of self-referencing

1038
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:27,330
Speaker 1:  would go away.

1039
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:30,210
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But like Ben, if this whole thing is a head fake and it's like, we're

1040
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:33,180
Speaker 4:  totally open except you have to use Microsoft teams and have a Microsoft

1041
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,660
Speaker 4:  account and basically use edge all the time. But we're totally open, I think

1042
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:37,470
Speaker 4:  would be sad.

1043
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:41,220
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like I hope, I hope that's not how it is, but we'll be

1044
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:44,880
Speaker 5:  digging into it early next week to uncover

1045
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,780
Speaker 5:  these ghastly parts. Is that when it comes out, the preview

1046
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,750
Speaker 5:  bill comes out early next week. So the actual release of windows 11, they

1047
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:55,650
Speaker 5:  haven't said, they've said it's like holiday time, but October

1048
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:58,590
Speaker 5:  like some, some point in October, probably early.

1049
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:00,840
Speaker 1:  Well they've got to do it before holiday laptop

1050
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,500
Speaker 5:  Shopping, right? Yeah. So October is almost guaranteed.

1051
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,020
Speaker 1:  All right, we're gonna take a break. And then there's a bunch of lightning

1052
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,670
Speaker 1:  round stuff we got to get through and to come back, we'll be right

1053
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:12,600
Speaker 1:  back.

1054
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,360
Speaker ?:  We think a lot about the two technology we use, but what about the technology

1055
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,350
Speaker ?:  we were with our classic full zip hoodie, American giant obsessed over

Speaker ?:  30th terms and conditions apply.

1090
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:20,260
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. I was just talking about the anti-trust bills.

1091
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:24,130
Speaker 1:  We don't know what they're going to do. I go read McKenna's report. She did

1092
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:26,890
Speaker 1:  sit through it. Congratulations to her. They did pass

1093
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:30,160
Speaker 1:  largely the same as they were before. So no cell

1094
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,550
Speaker 1:  preferencing, no conflicts of interest. The FTC gets more money for

1095
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:37,480
Speaker 1:  investigations, data portability, all that stuff that we've talked

1096
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:41,080
Speaker 1:  about with McKenna before it's got to get through the house. Some big

1097
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,810
Speaker 1:  rifts in both the Democrats and

1098
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:47,740
Speaker 1:  Republicans, notably all of the, all of the

1099
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:51,610
Speaker 1:  representatives from California, where all the big tech

1100
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:55,480
Speaker 1:  companies are like United across party lines to be like, screw

1101
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,410
Speaker 1:  this. It's very funny. We'll see.

1102
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:02,830
Speaker 1:  I think what the idea that I would put in everybody's head is a

1103
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:06,760
Speaker 1:  good, meaningful criticism of these pills. We don't know what's going to

1104
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,220
Speaker 1:  happen. Right? You pass them. You'll change the dynamics of the marketplace.

1105
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:12,490
Speaker 1:  So prohibit all this stuff, you might end up breaking up a big bunch of the

1106
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:15,400
Speaker 1:  big tech companies are forcing Amazon to sell AWS or

1107
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,380
Speaker 1:  whatever. We don't know. I think that's a fair

1108
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,680
Speaker 1:  of the bills on the flip side. What I would, I would put it in your head

1109
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,670
Speaker 1:  is it would be weird if we did know. Right? So if the bills

1110
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:30,660
Speaker 1:  were like, Amazon must sell AWS, I'd be a little

1111
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,500
Speaker 1:  antsy, right? Like we know what this market looks like.

1112
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,400
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It kind of looks like I've got some money. And if I bought

1113
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,460
Speaker 1:  one Google home, now I have to spend all the rest of my money on Google services

1114
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,940
Speaker 1:  until I'm dead. Right? Like I've got some money. I bought one apple

1115
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:48,810
Speaker 1:  device. No other smart watches shall ever exist in my, in my

1116
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:52,530
Speaker 1:  life because apple refuses to let anything else work with. It's

1117
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:55,200
Speaker 1:  like, we know what this market looks like. I think a lot of people are happy

1118
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,980
Speaker 1:  with it. We don't know what it looks like. If these companies have to be

1119
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,610
Speaker 1:  more interoperable or if they can't self preference. So

1120
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:06,570
Speaker 1:  ruthlessly, I'm kind of like, we'll just flip the table and find out like

1121
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:10,500
Speaker 1:  they're smart, right? These are the richest companies in the world led

1122
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:14,460
Speaker 1:  by people who definitely think they're the smartest people in the world.

1123
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,880
Speaker 1:  I'm confident. They'll find ways to make money and make cool stuff. And if

1124
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,810
Speaker 1:  you're like flip the table, it's, they're not going to quit. Whereas

1125
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:24,930
Speaker 1:  I think if the government was like, we're definitely making it so that when

1126
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:28,890
Speaker 1:  you swipe left on an iPhone, it runs Chrome. I'd be like, I

1127
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:31,290
Speaker 1:  don't want you to design my phone. So that's like,

1128
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:33,240
Speaker 6:  I would just, I don't

1129
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,860
Speaker 1:  Know which one's right. I don't like, I think that's a totally fair credit.

1130
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:37,040
Speaker 1:  I'd

1131
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:40,910
Speaker 5:  Argue that we do know though, because we know, we know that competition is

1132
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:42,380
Speaker 5:  best for consumers. Right.

1133
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:45,860
Speaker 1:  But you have to imagine the outcome, right? There's like this big leap that

1134
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,010
Speaker 1:  you have

1135
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:48,980
Speaker 5:  To. Yeah. But if it means splitting up like ads from

1136
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:52,820
Speaker 5:  Amazon, you know, windows from Microsoft, whatever. Like if it

1137
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:55,550
Speaker 5:  means all that sort of stuff, then ultimately it's just going to make them

1138
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:59,540
Speaker 5:  compete with each other even stronger than before. Right. Which

1139
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,880
Speaker 5:  should mean better products.

1140
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,480
Speaker 1:  This is the idea. This is if you've been listening to the Vergecast for however

1141
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,440
Speaker 1:  long, like, yes. I fully believe we fully believe that

1142
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,590
Speaker 1:  if you've got some dollars in your pocket, like you're best served. If a

1143
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:15,890
Speaker 1:  lot of companies are trying to fight for those dollars, I'll give you the

1144
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:19,700
Speaker 1:  opposite example of this broadband in America. We have railing with the lack

1145
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:23,450
Speaker 1:  of competition in broadband America, for years optimum just

1146
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:27,410
Speaker 1:  lowered its speeds to better align

1147
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:31,160
Speaker 1:  with the market. So they looked around and said, man, where our

1148
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,700
Speaker 1:  services faster on uploads than everybody else, we're just going to

1149
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,690
Speaker 1:  lower.

1150
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:37,070
Speaker 6:  Well, because no one can leave.

1151
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:40,700
Speaker 1:  Like what are you gonna do? Are you gonna move to Dieter's crappy

1152
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,800
Speaker 1:  Comcast?

1153
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,470
Speaker 6:  Like it's the opposite of competition because Andrew

1154
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:48,590
Speaker 4:  Is an excellent editor. What you don't know listening to this is I have cut

1155
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:52,520
Speaker 4:  out of this podcast recording like three times because Comcast is just like,

1156
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:52,910
Speaker 4:  nah,

1157
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:56,540
Speaker 1:  Not today. If you've heard me vamping it's because Dieter has just disappeared

1158
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:59,000
Speaker 1:  for seconds at a time. But

1159
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,990
Speaker 1:  like Comcast NBC universal as an investor and rice being

1160
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:06,950
Speaker 1:  their parent company, et cetera. Sorry, all I'm saying is part of what you're

1161
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:10,880
Speaker 1:  going to hear from big tech companies over the next few months as these

1162
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,240
Speaker 1:  bills make their way forward is we don't know what they do. We don't know

1163
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,590
Speaker 1:  how they work. They're going to make the products worse. They're going to

1164
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:21,280
Speaker 1:  force you to not have LinkedIn integrated Microsoft word, which is my favorite

1165
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,150
Speaker 1:  example I keep using. And it's like, I don't care.

1166
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:28,870
Speaker 1:  Like I can't shake the feeling that I know what this is.

1167
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:29,610
Speaker 1:  Like, it's

1168
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:33,390
Speaker 5:  Like working out, you know, like open stuff

1169
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:36,780
Speaker 5:  up, like I'm sure there's, there's obviously gonna be security, concerns,

1170
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:40,680
Speaker 5:  platforms, and all that. Like, you know, the 16 page PDF that apple puts

1171
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,960
Speaker 5:  out all that sort of stuff. But like, like you say, they're smart, you know

1172
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,400
Speaker 5:  that they can compete. They can figure these difficult things

1173
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,000
Speaker 5:  out. And I feel like it's definitely for

1174
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,630
Speaker 5:  the consumer benefit for there to be more competition.

1175
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:57,990
Speaker 4:  And if they can't figure it out, they'll die and somebody else will figure

1176
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,980
Speaker 4:  it out. And that will also

1177
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,170
Speaker 6:  Be fine. Yeah. There's just,

1178
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:05,130
Speaker 1:  I dunno, I, we haven't talked about it a lot, but the like the tech companies

1179
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:09,010
Speaker 1:  are lobbying super hard. Tim cook called Nancy Pelosi. Right? The New York

1180
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:12,390
Speaker 1:  times reported he was calling everybody in Congress that he knew to our UNC

1181
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:15,840
Speaker 1:  spills. The money they're spending lobbying is out of control. They've they've

1182
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:19,710
Speaker 1:  spun up new lobbying groups. X school executives are in charge of these

1183
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:23,190
Speaker 1:  lobbying groups. It's like, yeah, it's politics. It's kind of

1184
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:27,180
Speaker 1:  gross. Lobbying is just part of it. I just haven't heard a good argument

1185
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:31,050
Speaker 1:  yet, besides we don't know what these bills would do. And like the,

1186
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:34,980
Speaker 1:  the leap is, well, that's the idea, right? That you would

1187
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:38,970
Speaker 1:  reset the market and everything would be more competitive. And

1188
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:42,900
Speaker 1:  if I wanted to buy a pebble that could send messages

1189
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:46,830
Speaker 1:  from my iPhone, I might be able to fry instead of that

1190
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:49,980
Speaker 1:  company just dying because it didn't have access to the operating

1191
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:53,610
Speaker 1:  system. And yes, there are security concerns and yes, I don't know

1192
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:57,420
Speaker 1:  pirates are going to do piracy, but like, those were the

1193
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:01,230
Speaker 1:  arguments I heard from the music industry when they wanted to have DRM.

1194
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:04,410
Speaker 1:  Right. And like, it was bad and we, they didn't do it. And they figured out

1195
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:07,860
Speaker 1:  a new way to run their, their entire industry. And

1196
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:11,220
Speaker 4:  Now most of the music that people listen to is streamed and proprietary

1197
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,500
Speaker 4:  format.

1198
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,210
Speaker 1:  It's true. They did figure that out. I just feel

1199
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:18,090
Speaker 5:  Like if we get to a point where like companies like pebble

1200
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:21,870
Speaker 5:  exists and like I'm not buying all my stuff from

1201
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:25,860
Speaker 5:  apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, these big tech companies, or

1202
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:29,580
Speaker 5:  I'm not seeing these crazy startups think of something really inventive.

1203
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:33,330
Speaker 5:  And then for it to be crushed because apple does the same thing a

1204
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:36,990
Speaker 5:  year or two later, if we get to a point where that stops happening in

1205
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:40,950
Speaker 5:  such frequency or like apple and all these big tech companies keep

1206
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:44,940
Speaker 5:  acquiring all these startups because they can. And because there's no

1207
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,660
Speaker 5:  scrutiny for these small startups, then that's way better for

1208
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,440
Speaker 5:  consumers

1209
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,530
Speaker 1:  Did her and I were talking about this. You can read this in one or two ways,

1210
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:55,950
Speaker 1:  but there's big piece. And there were times about Google and like, maybe

1211
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:59,490
Speaker 1:  it's moving in slow motion and it's not so innovative anymore. Yeah. And

1212
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:02,640
Speaker 1:  like, I don't know. I, I feel that way. Other people

1213
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,180
Speaker 1:  don't feel as, quite as strongly about that as I do. But there was this

1214
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:09,930
Speaker 1:  paragraph in that story that was like a lot of Google's

1215
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:13,890
Speaker 1:  products are developed in an enter something called pantry mode where they

1216
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:17,870
Speaker 1:  just wait until some other startup releases them.

1217
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:21,530
Speaker 1:  And then they just like fire out those products as a clone. Yeah. And it's

1218
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:25,490
Speaker 1:  like, incredible. That's horrible.

1219
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:28,800
Speaker 1:  Like, why wouldn't you just do it first if you already invented it. And it's

1220
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,690
Speaker 1:  because fuel's printing money and its ad business,

1221
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:36,230
Speaker 1:  it doesn't even have to take any risks. And if somebody else proves that

1222
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:40,160
Speaker 1:  this is a good idea, they can just release a product,

1223
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:44,030
Speaker 1:  put Google, meet everywhere and something Google meet. We have to pretend

1224
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:47,930
Speaker 1:  it's like a good real competitor. And it's like,

1225
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:51,740
Speaker 1:  my computer is dying. Please. Someone help me because I

1226
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:55,460
Speaker 1:  tried to go to a Google meet meeting it's nuts. And that sort

1227
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:59,390
Speaker 1:  of dynamic, I don't know. I would just like to see that change. The flip

1228
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:03,170
Speaker 1:  side of this is chest pressure

1229
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:06,950
Speaker 1:  prevents them from doing good things too. Right? So like

1230
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:10,370
Speaker 1:  Google wants to turn off third party cookies and Chrome. I think Dieter,

1231
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:12,830
Speaker 1:  you understand this better than anybody. If they want to turn it off with

1232
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:13,750
Speaker 1:  a can't

1233
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:17,080
Speaker 4:  Right. So here's the thing. Google makes the world's most popular desktop

1234
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,380
Speaker 4:  browser. They also completely dominate the online ad

1235
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:24,040
Speaker 4:  industry. And if they make a change to the

1236
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,910
Speaker 4:  world's most popular desktop browser, it could in theory, give them

1237
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:31,870
Speaker 4:  more power in the ad industry because it would cut off a bunch

1238
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:35,530
Speaker 4:  of other advertisers from tracking you. And

1239
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:39,250
Speaker 4:  so they want to cut off third party cookies. They've come up with this technology

1240
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:42,970
Speaker 4:  called flock. That's supposed to like put you in a demographic group. Everybody

1241
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:46,930
Speaker 4:  hates it. Nobody trusts them. And so they're like, yeah, no, we can't do

1242
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:50,650
Speaker 4:  it. We just got to wait. We're going to like, like the EU, the UK

1243
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:53,620
Speaker 4:  regulator. They're like working with them to like come up with a way to do

1244
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:56,380
Speaker 4:  it. They're going to spend more time trying to come up with new technologies

1245
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:59,410
Speaker 4:  to replace a third-party cookie. And they're just like stuck. They're stuck

1246
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:01,900
Speaker 4:  because if they just made the browser, they can be like, yeah, we're going

1247
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,910
Speaker 4:  to compete in the world of browsers. We're going to make a browser that like

1248
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:07,210
Speaker 4:  protects your privacy. It does all this stuff. It'll be great, but they can't

1249
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:09,790
Speaker 4:  do that because if they did that, it would affect their other business and

1250
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:13,750
Speaker 4:  would also affect their relationship with a bunch of regulators. And

1251
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:17,200
Speaker 4:  so they just kind of had to like push. And

1252
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:21,070
Speaker 4:  so I, you know, no one should feel bad for Google,

1253
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:24,940
Speaker 4:  but like the reason they're not doing it is because there's

1254
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:28,300
Speaker 4:  like all of these other forces being applied to their

1255
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:31,930
Speaker 4:  browser and it aligns, it messes with our business model. Whereas

1256
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:35,920
Speaker 4:  apple messing with their browser, doesn't mess with their business model

1257
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,040
Speaker 4:  at all. So they're like, yeah, we block everything. You can't find the URL

1258
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,250
Speaker 4:  anymore. The tabs are over here and over there and who knows anymore. And

1259
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:45,430
Speaker 4:  it's fine. And it's great. But Google doesn't have the freedom to do that.

1260
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:49,330
Speaker 4:  Like when this news hit that they were delaying the goo, the cookie

1261
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:52,200
Speaker 4:  apocalypse and they were, you know, not implementing Flocka, blah, blah,

1262
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,960
Speaker 4:  blah, blah. Every ad tech company on the planet had their

1263
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,800
Speaker 4:  stock just leap into the sky. Yeah. Because they

1264
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,980
Speaker 4:  all, they all got to reprieve. They get more time to like try out more crap

1265
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:06,640
Speaker 4:  and figure stuff out and continue to track you for another two years.

1266
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,060
Speaker 1:  So what's really interesting about flock besides its horrible

1267
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,410
Speaker 1:  name

1268
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:13,830
Speaker 6:  Is like in the abstract,

1269
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:17,820
Speaker 1:  This is also apples and sort of tracking right that

1270
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,630
Speaker 1:  on your device, it will figure out some set of cohort you're

1271
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:24,750
Speaker 1:  in, you're this old you're in this place, you have these

1272
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:28,560
Speaker 1:  interests, whatever. Yeah. And then advertisers can target

1273
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,010
Speaker 1:  that and your device will do it, but they will know who you are.

1274
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:35,850
Speaker 1:  Right. Zoomed way out. That is exactly what Google is trying to do.

1275
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:39,300
Speaker 1:  But because they're the dominant ad tech provider or the dominant advertiser

1276
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:43,230
Speaker 1:  on the web, they run Chrome. No one wants to go down

1277
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,720
Speaker 1:  that road with him. Whereas apple,

1278
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,120
Speaker 4:  Well, no one trusts them. No, one's like, oh, Google is doing it. It must

1279
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,060
Speaker 4:  be bad. So like WordPress and Amazon and every other browser and the planet,

1280
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:53,630
Speaker 4:  we're like, Nope, screw this Mozilla actually did just put out a white paper

1281
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:57,020
Speaker 4:  saying, yeah, here are all the problems flock in such a way where it's like,

1282
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:00,920
Speaker 4:  they could maybe be convinced that they could maybe find a, not, not

1283
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:04,490
Speaker 4:  problem with Fox someday, but we're so far from that. So the other part of

1284
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:07,340
Speaker 4:  Google's announcement is they'd like really talked about like, there's a

1285
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:10,700
Speaker 4:  process for web standards. You see, and this is how it works. And it's like,

1286
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:14,360
Speaker 4:  yeah, we know. So, but they're like laying the groundwork for being like,

1287
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,510
Speaker 4:  well, flock was a good experiment. The web standards process had it say,

1288
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:20,150
Speaker 4:  and now we're doing this other thing, you know, we've evolved it and they'll

1289
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:22,880
Speaker 4:  like, drop it or something. We

1290
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,600
Speaker 1:  Talked about the web a lot. Like this is a huge deal. Yeah. And

1291
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,210
Speaker 1:  Google cannot figure it out. And part of the reason they can't figure it

1292
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:32,690
Speaker 1:  out is because of antitrust concerns because they are so

1293
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:36,530
Speaker 1:  dominant. So everyone would like them to stop tracking. And

1294
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:40,130
Speaker 1:  apple is going to run ad after ad, after ad hammering, Google for

1295
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:43,610
Speaker 1:  tracking. But then like the UK competition authority is

1296
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:47,480
Speaker 1:  like knives, keep tracking or enable enabling cookies, which

1297
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:51,300
Speaker 1:  allow other people to track that. So, yeah. I don't know. Just like my, my

1298
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:55,190
Speaker 1:  other proposed antitrust rule is like, maybe we just don't let at and T

1299
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:58,250
Speaker 1:  buy anything and that'll solve like a whole swath of problems in the tech

1300
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:01,590
Speaker 1:  industry. Like maybe the other one is like, just like block

1301
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:04,700
Speaker 1:  cookies, like anti-trust except for ad tech

1302
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,470
Speaker 1:  industry. Yeah.

1303
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:08,960
Speaker 4:  Let's do it. See what happens. That'd be fine. Let's

1304
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,630
Speaker 1:  Go. We got the lightning round. Do you want to go through a theater?

1305
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:15,170
Speaker 4:  We have got mobile world Congress coming up. Surprise, surprise. It's like

1306
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:18,680
Speaker 4:  sort of, kind of happening. Samsung is having an event we're

1307
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:22,610
Speaker 4:  expecting. They might do something with the watch. Maybe it'll be the first

1308
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:26,270
Speaker 4:  new version aware O S watch maybe.

1309
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:30,260
Speaker 4:  And the Z fold three and the Z flip three, just leaked today.

1310
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:33,530
Speaker 4:  As a recording, this, it looks like the CFL three will be compatible to

1311
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:37,370
Speaker 4:  stylists. It looks like the Z flip three has a screen that isn't the

1312
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:40,790
Speaker 4:  size of your pinky fingernail, which is great. I have no idea if these will

1313
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:44,000
Speaker 4:  be announced at MWC or not. And then the other big phone

1314
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,900
Speaker 4:  rumor is apple is thinking about making a less expensive,

1315
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:51,830
Speaker 4:  big phone next year, which is like welcome to 2018.

1316
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:52,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1317
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,000
Speaker 1:  Sheep, big phones who knew. Yeah. Everybody,

1318
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,440
Speaker 6:  Literally everybody

1319
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,920
Speaker 1:  Actually Mitchell wrote this story for us and he's he has this

1320
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,700
Speaker 1:  great segment in the middle of the story. That's like during the trial, a

1321
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:08,060
Speaker 1:  bunch of stuff that leaked from apple was, oh yeah, they do do a bunch of

1322
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:11,980
Speaker 1:  market research and they do commission analysts, firms go out

1323
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,850
Speaker 1:  and like, there's a CCU graphs at apple commission. That's like, yep.

1324
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,680
Speaker 1:  People like big phones and they like cheap

1325
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:20,700
Speaker 1:  ones.

1326
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:24,540
Speaker 1:  Yep. Pretty much. I'm glad you paid a company to tell you to

1327
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:28,410
Speaker 1:  say, okay, I'm just going to

1328
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:32,400
Speaker 1:  end on this. Okay. You ready for this? Here we go. T-Mobile is

1329
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,370
Speaker 1:  selling a 5g branded gin.

1330
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:39,060
Speaker 4:  Look, we already called dibs

1331
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:42,840
Speaker 4:  on mobile wireless related alcohol. It's called

1332
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,320
Speaker 4:  scissor vodka. It's true. It has a tagline. Cut. Snip, snip cut through the

1333
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,960
Speaker 4:  night. It's just cut through the night. Let's just cut to the night. But

1334
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,320
Speaker 4:  then you say snip, snip. They go together. Maybe even a snipping

1335
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,040
Speaker 4:  noise. They totally just stole this idea from us.

1336
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:59,160
Speaker 5:  I love how it's called a five gin. No,

1337
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:03,000
Speaker 1:  And there's five ginger beer. It's good. It's hot. I will say

1338
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,960
Speaker 1:  this a long time ago. This is a true story. A long time ago,

1339
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,500
Speaker 1:  we were back in a gadget. We ran and gadget mobile and gadgets color was

1340
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,310
Speaker 1:  blue and gadget mobile's color was pink and T-Mobile sends a

1341
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:18,150
Speaker 1:  cease and desist to AOL saying it. And gadget

1342
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:21,060
Speaker 1:  mobile had to stop using the color pink because T-Mobile was

1343
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:24,900
Speaker 1:  spanked. We said, no, actually ran a

1344
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:28,650
Speaker 1:  story. That was great. Well, it's my turn. All right. Mobile vodkas are

1345
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:31,680
Speaker 1:  my thing. T-Mobile well, it's a gin. So

1346
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:35,520
Speaker 1:  technically fine. Every summer, every

1347
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,670
Speaker 1:  summer, the world tries to get me to drink gin. You notice this and every

1348
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:41,520
Speaker 1:  summer I drink it and I'm sorry. I know you're British. And it's like in

1349
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,240
Speaker 1:  your blood or whatever,

1350
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,610
Speaker 6:  But it's horrible. No, that's great. What are you talking

1351
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:46,830
Speaker 1:  About? Horrible. It's like drinking a tree.

1352
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:50,820
Speaker 4:  The thing I'm unhappy about is last week we saw dish

1353
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:54,570
Speaker 4:  try and launch a project Genesis for the S was a

1354
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:57,960
Speaker 4:  five. And now we have five

1355
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,890
Speaker 4:  gin stop taking the 5g things and incorporating

1356
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,450
Speaker 4:  it into other words. Yeah. Don't want

1357
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:06,990
Speaker 1:  It. This is what I mean about the pandemic. Like all the way down the line,

1358
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:10,530
Speaker 1:  the branding consultants, just like when they were home, they didn't

1359
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:14,460
Speaker 1:  get parties to go to. They have time to burn. They were just like, here's

1360
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,320
Speaker 1:  some ideas. The,

1361
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:20,070
Speaker 5:  The five ginger beer was just one step too far. Five, five gin.

1362
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,330
Speaker 5:  Okay. Huh? Five

1363
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:23,340
Speaker 6:  Ginger beer. Just look at it. It just looks

01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:26,970
Speaker 6:  <inaudible> all right.

1365
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:30,390

1386
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:44,180
Speaker 1:  and couldn't and like all the themes we just talked about with big companies
