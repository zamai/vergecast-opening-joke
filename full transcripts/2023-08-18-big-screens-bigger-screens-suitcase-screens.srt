Speaker 3:  And welcome to our cha, the flagship podcast of gadgets and

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,720
Speaker 3:  suitcases. We're bringing it back. So much of what's happening

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,120
Speaker 3:  in our culture now is things that have happened previously in our culture

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,800
Speaker 3:  and gadgets and suitcases is one of that's some old like 1960s

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,800
Speaker 3:  James Bond stuff and LG is bringing it back. We're gonna talk about that

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,920
Speaker 3:  a lot, but I'm your friend Neli. David. Pierce here.

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,600
Speaker 5:  Hi. I really like the fact that we've talked a lot about how like on the

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,720
Speaker 5:  internet it's 2006 again and with

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,720
Speaker 5:  gadgets it's 1958. Like I love it.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,080
Speaker 5:  I'm all

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,920
Speaker 3:  In. We need a whole suitcase for this camera. Alex Cranz is here.

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,160
Speaker 4:  I always liked the the typewriter in a suitcase. Oh that's good like

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,120
Speaker 4:  that. That really had a nice appeal to me.

28
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,280
Speaker 3:  Again, more things need their own bespoke cases that you bring

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,560
Speaker 3:  around.

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,280
Speaker 4:  A hundred percent. I

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,880
Speaker 5:  Mean isn't this is the exact same energy as the resurgence of the flip phones,

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,680
Speaker 5:  right? Like the experience of I want to use the gadget to, I'm using

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,840
Speaker 5:  the gadget right now. It's just like you just like tap your screen. Yeah,

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,720
Speaker 5:  that's not enough. Make me do more mechanical stuff to use my

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,640
Speaker 5:  gadgets. I wanna have to like take a cover off of my television.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,680
Speaker 5:  I want to have to plug some things in. I wanna like do incantations, like

37
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,640
Speaker 5:  make me work

38
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,960
Speaker 3:  One of those big pole switches like

39
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,160
Speaker 4:  Yeah, exactly.

40
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I wanna have to turn a key while someone else on the other side of

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,960
Speaker 5:  the room also turns a key. Like that's, that's how I wanna use computers.

42
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,080
Speaker 3:  This is gonna be our new published process is like multiple key turns and

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,320
Speaker 3:  then a blog post goes out.

44
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,960
Speaker 4:  That's how you stay fast. That's

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,200
Speaker 3:  How you stay fast. That's really how You know like did I get it right? Like

46
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,800
Speaker 3:  I'm asking someone else to turn a key. I better have done this correctly.

47
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,080
Speaker 3:  Okay, so it's been one of those weeks where there's like lots of

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
Speaker 3:  little news going on. So there's lots to talk about. There is

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,960
Speaker 3:  a TV in a suitcase, which I suspect we're gonna talk about at length. There's

50
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,720
Speaker 3:  other bits of gadget news, there's a bunch of streaming news. Trump's

51
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,200
Speaker 3:  DMs have been subpoenaed from Twitter, which is amazing and we should talk

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,840
Speaker 3:  about just encryption in general as a concept. Lots of that

53
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,320
Speaker 3:  stuff. Dan Sever's gonna join us for the second segment. This week was the

54
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,120
Speaker 3:  25th anniversary of the iMac. We had a big package about that. Lots to talk

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,000
Speaker 3:  about there. And then of course we are pretty certain that there will be

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,920
Speaker 3:  a new iPhone in September. So I'll talk about that with Dan a little bit.

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,760
Speaker 3:  And what's coming, it seems like the camera bump shocker getting

58
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,360
Speaker 3:  bigger on the iPhone this year. It hasn't gone the other way in quite some

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
Speaker 3:  time. But let's start. There is one big thing happening in the world

60
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,080
Speaker 3:  of tech and media that several of you have asked us

61
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,480
Speaker 3:  to talk about. I've gotten some tweets, I've gotten some emails, I've gotten

62
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,360
Speaker 3:  some Instagram threads and it's what what's happening at at Linus Tech

63
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,280
Speaker 3:  Tips, big YouTube channel run by Linus Sebastian. We are reporting on

64
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,520
Speaker 3:  it. We have a story on it. Alex wrote that story. I sure did. People are

65
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,400
Speaker 3:  talking to us. The basics are like fairly simple. And

66
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,240
Speaker 3:  then what has happened is ever more complex. So Gamers Nexus did a video

67
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,480
Speaker 3:  calling out some inaccuracies in Linus tech Tips testing

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,400
Speaker 3:  policies, controversy with a G P U cooling block

69
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,400
Speaker 3:  that ended up at an auction and probably shouldn't have this

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,960
Speaker 3:  spiraled into a lot of craziness around that channel.

71
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,600
Speaker 3:  They released a video saying they were gonna pause production for a week,

72
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,440
Speaker 3:  that they'd gotten too sloppy, that they were running too hard and now there

73
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,120
Speaker 3:  are some allegations of sexual harassment in their workplace. That's a lot

74
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,360
Speaker 3:  from my perspective is editor-in-chief of The Verge. Our

75
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,080
Speaker 3:  contribution to this, insofar as we're gonna contribute to it is to do reporting,

76
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,080
Speaker 3:  is to make journalism. That's what we do here. So we're not gonna

77
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,320
Speaker 3:  overly comment or do analysis on that situation or

78
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,840
Speaker 3:  have opinions about it at this moment. We are gonna do some reporting and

79
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,360
Speaker 3:  figure out some real facts. That's what we're good at here in

80
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,160
Speaker 3:  particular. We're good at reporting on creators and we're pretty

81
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,960
Speaker 3:  good at understanding the dynamics of tech creators, right?

82
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,200
Speaker 3:  They're, they sit right next to us. We, we watch them very carefully. We

83
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Speaker 3:  have lots of relationships with them, but we are not that thing. Like we

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Speaker 3:  are not in platform dynamics in that way. Like that's, we are journalists

85
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,760
Speaker 3:  over here so we're just gonna maintain some of that distance So. we

86
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,040
Speaker 3:  can put some reporting into the situation. I think that's important. That's

87
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,720
Speaker 3:  where we're gonna be for a minute. The one thing I will say it has nothing

88
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,160
Speaker 3:  to this situation specifically or that channel or that company specifically

89
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,480
Speaker 3:  is that this pattern in media repeats pretty

90
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,680
Speaker 3:  often. So when we were all baby bloggers, we were

91
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,600
Speaker 3:  like screw the big newspapers. Like this is the beginning of my career

92
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,040
Speaker 3:  in the mid two thousands was a bunch of bloggers being like, the

93
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,000
Speaker 3:  institutional newspapers and magazines are garbage. We're gonna undo

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,800
Speaker 3:  them. We don't need all their process and all their dumb ethic.

95
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,480
Speaker 3:  Like we, I did it, I was there and now we have The Verge and it's like

96
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,560
Speaker 3:  hard fought over a decade later and we

97
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,400
Speaker 3:  have a huge ethics policy and like our disclosures on this podcast,

98
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,520
Speaker 3:  we do them so often that they're like a joke and we're like transparent about

99
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,360
Speaker 3:  our reporting standards and we have a background policy and if you look at

100
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,320
Speaker 3:  it you're like, oh shit. Like we just recapitulated all of the

101
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,200
Speaker 3:  things of traditional media because the pressure on us

102
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,640
Speaker 3:  as we got bigger and bigger was that we needed that stuff. And yes,

103
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,560
Speaker 3:  we got to reinvent it. And yes, we got yelled at a bunch along the way

104
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,400
Speaker 3:  about not having some of it, but it's largely the same as like what happened

105
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
Speaker 3:  before we did it our way. And I think we did it better than

106
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,040
Speaker 3:  some of the ways that had been done before. 'cause I think that's important

107
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,000
Speaker 3:  to try to improve, but we, we had to do it again. And that was like early

108
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,560
Speaker 3:  blogging. I think in general, like the YouTube

109
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,720
Speaker 3:  ecosystem is arriving at that place. So

110
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,800
Speaker 3:  other big YouTubers, they have ethics policies, they have review stamp,

111
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,840
Speaker 3:  they talk about that stuff and they need that stuff because that ultimately

112
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,720
Speaker 3:  protects you when you are at this scale for a lot of

113
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,640
Speaker 3:  reasons. And you need it to build trust with your audience. I think that

114
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,440
Speaker 3:  will happen to TikTok again in a really short order. We,

115
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,920
Speaker 3:  there's a story we quick posted this week in the Times about movie

116
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,320
Speaker 3:  reviewers on TikTok on movie talk who insist that they are not

117
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,200
Speaker 3:  Critics and they take money from the studios and they don't wanna

118
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,840
Speaker 3:  do negative reviews and all that's, and that's just the beginning of the

119
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,200
Speaker 3:  cycle, right? They're like, we're not these old fuddy duddy movie, movie

120
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,000
Speaker 3:  Critics, we're something new and eventually they're gonna, they're gonna

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,520
Speaker 3:  not be new.

122
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,840
Speaker 4:  I was like, that's what Harry Knowles said, right? Like 1999 when he

123
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,760
Speaker 4:  launched his movie site, right? Like we see this over and over and over again.

124
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,360
Speaker 4:  There's a new medium and everybody goes into like, you have new

125
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,640
Speaker 4:  access like right? There's different gatekeepers and so you're like, okay,

126
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,040
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna go become a robot, go do the cool things in this medium and

127
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,560
Speaker 4:  not do it like all the other people who've done it in other mediums before

128
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,360
Speaker 4:  me. And then you kind of discover that actually some of that

129
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,240
Speaker 4:  stuff makes sense and there's a reason they do it.

130
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,240
Speaker 3:  Yep. Your desire for access can corrupt you in like very specific ways

131
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,440
Speaker 3:  that are repeatable and understandable and predictable. Your

132
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,160
Speaker 3:  need to have the audience like you, especially on an algorithmic platform,

133
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,440
Speaker 3:  very predictable at this point. Like the pressures are the same and they,

134
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,800
Speaker 3:  they lead to the same outcomes and in particular

135
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,640
Speaker 3:  the algorithmic platforms, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram,

136
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,600
Speaker 3:  whatever, they kind of destabilize groups from working

137
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,880
Speaker 3:  together. It, they are very individualistic. So like there is not,

138
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,600
Speaker 3:  if you look at YouTube, David and I were talking about this today. If you

139
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,520
Speaker 3:  look at YouTube, big media brands are not successful on YouTube

140
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,200
Speaker 3:  that can ban together and say these are our standards and we will enforce

141
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,240
Speaker 3:  them. Like generally that is not the case on YouTube generally. That is not

142
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,800
Speaker 3:  the case on Instagram. It is all individuals. So individuals

143
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,480
Speaker 3:  run into these problems like over and over again at scale

144
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,280
Speaker 3:  and then disaster strikes.

145
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,680
Speaker 5:  Well, and that confluence you just described, I think is the thing that is

146
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,680
Speaker 5:  new, right? Like I think what we were all going through You know in,

147
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,480
Speaker 5:  in the early mid aughts in the sort of blogging revolution was like,

148
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,600
Speaker 5:  it, it was about sort of teams and websites or whatever. And then the next

149
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,440
Speaker 5:  thing that happened was very much the like individual creator.

150
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,120
Speaker 5:  And there's this thing that happens that happens to people over and over

151
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,920
Speaker 5:  and over on these platforms. You get big enough that you literally just

152
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,000
Speaker 5:  hit the ceiling of what you can do alone. So these folks are building out

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,160
Speaker 5:  and they're building big staffs and what you do is you end up sort of

154
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,480
Speaker 5:  exporting your own self onto other people as you try to build

155
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,480
Speaker 5:  a business because your audience is connected to you, like as a, as

156
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,720
Speaker 5:  a person. And and scaling that is really challenging. And I think

157
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,720
Speaker 5:  we've seen a lot of folks in a lot of different ways run into trouble with

158
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,320
Speaker 5:  like, how do I make this thing bigger than me when in fact

159
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,400
Speaker 5:  it is all about me? And that, that just becomes messy in so,

160
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,160
Speaker 5:  so many ways that I think no one or very few have like really

161
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,600
Speaker 5:  neatly figured out over time. Yeah.

162
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,520
Speaker 3:  And I think it's also just unreasonable to say to an

163
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,320
Speaker 3:  individual creator, like uphold the standards and practices of the AP

164
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,920
Speaker 5:  Right. While running at the speed of every single platform that exists on

165
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,760
Speaker 5:  the internet, which is required for you to do in order to continue to be

166
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,280
Speaker 5:  successful in your business. Yeah. Like it's just, it's just not possible.

167
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

168
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Speaker 3:  I, and I, and I think that's just very challenging and that that sort of

169
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,680
Speaker 3:  this thing I said at the very beginning like what we can contribute here

170
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,640
Speaker 3:  is some journalism. I mean that and we have the opportunity

171
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,720
Speaker 3:  to do it because we are under no pressure from the

172
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,480
Speaker 3:  algorithm to get views about this today. Like we just aren't You know.

173
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,760
Speaker 3:  And that's something that we fought hard for. That's why I care about our

174
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,000
Speaker 3:  website so much, right? We, we want to be apart from these platforms So,

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,600
Speaker 3:  we can report on them in a meaningful way. But I just see this,

176
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,880
Speaker 3:  this bigger story is the thing that has caught my interest here. Yes. This

177
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,600
Speaker 3:  the, these allegations are serious and yes, I think we need to report on

178
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,680
Speaker 3:  them and talk to all the principles and we are among the few sites that have

179
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,960
Speaker 3:  statements from some of the principles and Alex's story. I think that's important.

180
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,240
Speaker 3:  But it's because we spend our time insisting on

181
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,000
Speaker 3:  having statements from named principles in our stories. And we get to do

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,960
Speaker 3:  that because we run our own little platform and that cycle

183
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,440
Speaker 3:  of, okay, if I'm totally dependent on YouTube, I have to do whatever YouTube

184
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,360
Speaker 3:  wants me to do as a platform to get views. Like you can just see

185
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,080
Speaker 3:  how it just spirals outta control and no one over and over again like

186
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,800
Speaker 3:  YouTubers talk about this all the time. And very few people

187
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,560
Speaker 3:  have the opportunity to step out of that and say, look, I need to impose

188
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,520
Speaker 3:  my own principles here or I need to borrow some principles from other kinds

189
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,000
Speaker 3:  of media that have done this before instead of just, it's a raw

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,240
Speaker 3:  competition for attention and views on these platforms. So I just see that

191
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,160
Speaker 3:  very clearly, mostly because I lived through it as a baby in a different

192
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,120
Speaker 3:  medium. Like this has been my experience in media and we

193
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,040
Speaker 3:  have been lucky to say we are gonna build our thing as a

194
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,960
Speaker 3:  group under the brand of The Verge. And if I'm

195
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,760
Speaker 3:  not here, like the virtual will persist because it is a brand that

196
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,720
Speaker 3:  stands for something and like we own it. Like we, we

197
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,120
Speaker 3:  own our platform. Yes, we are very dependent on other

198
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,120
Speaker 3:  algorithmic traffic. Like yes, I've talked about that at length, but at the

199
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,600
Speaker 3:  end of the day, like our website is our website and we get to choose what

200
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,880
Speaker 3:  goes on it and not really overthink it. And like that's the distance that

201
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,160
Speaker 3:  I think is important that enables us to do journalism. But that is really

202
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,080
Speaker 3:  hard fought. Like at no point is that not on my mind

203
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,600
Speaker 3:  like these yeah, Alex and David like know, like this is what I think about

204
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,520
Speaker 3:  all day long. That's what we're gonna bring to this story. Like I don't wanna

205
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,960
Speaker 3:  overdo this conversation. I just see that pattern repeating and it's

206
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,280
Speaker 3:  at one stage for YouTube and it's another stage for TikTok and it's just

207
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,160
Speaker 3:  gonna keep happening as new media emerges. Yep. Alright, so

208
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,720
Speaker 3:  on that note, there are some YouTube news this week, which is kind of fascinating.

209
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,640
Speaker 3:  YouTube is a platform in a really interesting space, right? There's

210
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,520
Speaker 3:  YouTube Shorts and they're kind of adding some TikTok features and then there's

211
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,480
Speaker 3:  YouTube tv. And I guarantee you, with this coming football season, YouTube

212
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,000
Speaker 3:  TV is going to be the thing that they talk about and promote and think about

213
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,920
Speaker 3:  more than anything, which is wild because it's a cable

214
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,280
Speaker 3:  bundle.

215
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,560
Speaker 5:  It is and it isn't, right? So I, I've been talking to YouTube about this

216
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,680
Speaker 5:  for forever and the thing that is true about YouTube is it

217
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,440
Speaker 5:  has all of the pieces of everything

218
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,840
Speaker 5:  on its platform, right? Like every single entertainment thing you can

219
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,760
Speaker 5:  imagine exists somewhere inside of YouTube. And the thing

220
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,560
Speaker 5:  YouTube has never successfully done is put all those

221
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,280
Speaker 5:  pieces together, right? Like you look at YouTube music and it's like, okay,

222
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,160
Speaker 5:  you have a library of music, you also have every live performance, every,

223
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,000
Speaker 5:  you have this incredible library of covers that people do. You have all this

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,960
Speaker 5:  fan made stuff. Like how are you not figuring out how

225
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,920
Speaker 5:  to give me every imaginable Taylor Swift thing all in one place? I'm serious.

226
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,960
Speaker 5:  Like no platform has more of that than YouTube and

227
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,280
Speaker 5:  it has never successfully stitched all of it together. And I think

228
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,560
Speaker 5:  what it's trying to do with football is very much the same thing, right?

229
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,560
Speaker 5:  So they paid, what we've heard and reported was $2 billion a year for

230
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,480
Speaker 5:  NFL Sunday Ticket huge amount of money. There's I would say very little

231
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,240
Speaker 5:  chance that that is going to be like a strictly very profitable thing for

232
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,760
Speaker 5:  YouTube, especially in the early days. But what they're trying to do is figure

233
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,600
Speaker 5:  out, okay, how do we use that to essentially sell you a cable bundle? Which

234
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,840
Speaker 5:  like you said is deeply hilarious and we should talk more about the fact

235
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,840
Speaker 5:  that everything is just a cable bundle again. But they're also trying to

236
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,440
Speaker 5:  figure out how to, how to make it YouTube, right? Like one of the things

237
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,360
Speaker 5:  YouTube announced this week is that they're adding a bunch of features to

238
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,040
Speaker 5:  Sunday Ticket. They're gonna have live chat and polls inside a game,

239
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,440
Speaker 5:  which to me sounds like just like a waking nightmare. Like watching football

240
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,520
Speaker 5:  while a million internet strangers like yell about football sounds

241
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,320
Speaker 5:  awful. That's what Twitter used to be for, but I dunno, whatever. And they

242
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,240
Speaker 5:  added a thing where there's now gonna be a live set of Shorts

243
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,960
Speaker 5:  showing realtime highlights from every game on Sunday, which is

244
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,560
Speaker 5:  like technically really weird and complicated and I have lots of questions,

245
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,680
Speaker 5:  but is a really interesting idea. And they're doing all this stuff

246
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,120
Speaker 5:  with creators that they're not really talking about yet. But basically what

247
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,640
Speaker 5:  it seems like is YouTube creators are gonna have kind of

248
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,680
Speaker 5:  unlimited access to a huge amount of football content.

249
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Which is gonna be really interesting and is the kind of thing that

250
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,920
Speaker 5:  creators have not had easy access to before. So there's this thing where

251
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,720
Speaker 5:  YouTube is like, okay, we have football, like boil it all the way down, right?

252
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,160
Speaker 5:  Like we have a, we have football plays that happen on a field.

253
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,640
Speaker 5:  What are like all of the YouTubey things we can do with them? Which I just

254
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,480
Speaker 5:  think is like the most interesting question in the universe. And I think

255
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,320
Speaker 5:  YouTube like has barely any idea of all of the answers that there are to

256
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,600
Speaker 5:  that. But it's gonna be super interesting to like see how all of that shakes

257
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:07,680
Speaker 5:  out.

258
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,800
Speaker 3:  The creator side is the most interesting thing because it, there's no lack

259
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,520
Speaker 3:  of football plays on YouTube right now.

260
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But if you, if you like steal it, you run the risk of like a copyright

261
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,880
Speaker 5:  strike and it's like things can get kind of awkward. Like one thing I watch

262
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,640
Speaker 5:  a lot of is people talking about soccer, right? And there's like this

263
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,320
Speaker 5:  weird game you have to play if you are not the rights holder,

264
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,160
Speaker 5:  where they'll show like awkward animated stick figure

265
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,640
Speaker 5:  pictures of people moving around to like demonstrate tactics.

266
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,960
Speaker 5:  Or there's one guy who does a great thing where it's like an overhead shot

267
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,320
Speaker 5:  of what looks like a, the old Microsoft surface where he'll like

268
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,760
Speaker 5:  move little things around on the screen and people do these sort of clever

269
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,760
Speaker 5:  hacks to get around the fact that they can't actually just use the game.

270
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,320
Speaker 5:  And, and what the NFL is now doing is saying all of these people who wanna

271
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,280
Speaker 5:  make things about football like here have the game and you've been

272
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,880
Speaker 5:  able to watch highlights before but you've never been able to like use them

273
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,880
Speaker 5:  in the way that like you can use music. And I think that is big,

274
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,680
Speaker 3:  That's a good comparison to music, right? Like all the social

275
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,200
Speaker 3:  platforms apart from Twitter, we should, we can talk about that briefly,

276
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,920
Speaker 3:  but all the social platforms basically have blanket

277
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,000
Speaker 3:  licenses to the music catalogs and then creators can use them and

278
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,480
Speaker 3:  there's content ID and blah blah blah and the right to get paid when you

279
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,160
Speaker 3:  use music on YouTube. I'm skipping over an awful lot of

280
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,560
Speaker 3:  complexity there, but that's, that's how that's supposed to work.

281
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,280
Speaker 4:  That's fine, that's fine.

282
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,800
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Whereas sports leagues have not issued these sort of blanket

283
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,160
Speaker 3:  licenses. So this is like the first time with a major league

284
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,400
Speaker 3:  in a huge setting that this has been enabled.

285
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,840
Speaker 3:  I'm sort of curious how it works.

286
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,040
Speaker 5:  I am too. Like is

287
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,120
Speaker 3:  There, are they gonna do content id for football play? Like I, I, I just

288
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,080
Speaker 3:  dunno the answer to that question.

289
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. YouTube has not super explained all of that. There's a lot

290
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,840
Speaker 5:  left to do and I get the sense there's a lot they haven't quite figured out

291
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,400
Speaker 5:  yet and I think are probably gonna spend this first season figuring out.

292
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,800
Speaker 5:  But like that's very much the road they're heading down and I think it's

293
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,240
Speaker 5:  really interesting.

294
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,200
Speaker 4:  Why can't you just use the clips and comment on them? Because like with movies

295
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,880
Speaker 4:  and film, like movies and TV shows, you can just be like, here it is.

296
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,840
Speaker 4:  I'm talking about these two people talking because

297
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,800
Speaker 5:  The Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the NFL will come to your house and

298
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,320
Speaker 5:  beat you to death. Yeah. Is basically like, truly like sports

299
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,840
Speaker 5:  leagues are at the bleeding edge of being incredibly

300
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,640
Speaker 5:  litigious about people using their stuff that they're not

301
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,360
Speaker 5:  allowed to use. And the leagues have gotten more

302
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,800
Speaker 5:  permissive over time, I would say, because they've realized that having things

303
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,160
Speaker 5:  on You know House of Highlights on Instagram and on the various

304
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,360
Speaker 5:  accounts on different social media platforms is actually a good

305
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,400
Speaker 5:  marketing thing. The N B A has been way out in front of this. They were like,

306
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,200
Speaker 5:  oh, you want to like show cool highlights and make more people watch basketball?

307
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,280
Speaker 5:  Terrific. Knock yourself out. The NFL has been kind of all the way on the

308
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,280
Speaker 5:  other end of that spectrum where the NFL has been super, super, super protective

309
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,520
Speaker 5:  of all of that stuff over the years. And even it has loosened up a little,

310
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,320
Speaker 5:  but like, it, it's, it's the most valuable video that exists

311
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,400
Speaker 5:  in the world in like a very real way. And they've always been

312
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,440
Speaker 5:  super protective of it.

313
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,880
Speaker 3:  And it You know, it's funny 'cause they were going to sign this deal

314
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,840
Speaker 3:  with Apple and Apple was like, we want to do cool broadcast ideas

315
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,840
Speaker 3:  for our VR headset. And they said no because they

316
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,000
Speaker 3:  don't know how that's gonna work. They dunno where the money will come from.

317
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,080
Speaker 3:  And they ended up with YouTube that's like,

318
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,560
Speaker 3:  we're gonna use your clips across YouTube and presumably

319
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,720
Speaker 3:  when creators use these clips, the NFL will get money. Right? The

320
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,760
Speaker 3:  same way that the labels get money when you use music on YouTube or TikTok.

321
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,000
Speaker 3:  And I think the NFL just like deeply understands that, right? Like, oh,

322
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,880
Speaker 3:  automated, is it like licensing revenue? We understand that weird

323
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,520
Speaker 3:  VR headset idea give us 35 years, like

324
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,360
Speaker 3:  a hundred percent the split that is happening there.

325
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,400
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They're still stuck on would you like to watch this game on your phone?

326
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,640
Speaker 5:  Like we're, we're not nearly at VR yet.

327
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,080
Speaker 4:  I guess I was just like confused why it's not considered fair use to just

328
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,880
Speaker 4:  do sports videos.

329
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,960
Speaker 3:  So, so it is right. Your, your problem is nefarious

330
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,880
Speaker 3:  is complicated. You need to do, you need to add some value, right?

331
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Speaker 3:  That's basically it. The the, the standard is transformative affairs. You

332
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,120
Speaker 3:  need to make something new out of the clip. So yes, if you are sitting there

333
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,080
Speaker 3:  doing like deep analysis Dan Orlovsky like high

334
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,680
Speaker 3:  analysis of a play that he does on e s PN and you're like using like

335
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,410
Speaker 3:  several short seconds to like show a difference and you're like in it, you

336
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,290
Speaker 3:  can do that. And for example, our sister side SP Nation, you go to

337
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,370
Speaker 3:  secret base on YouTube, they are doing this all over the place and it is

338
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,690
Speaker 3:  great and that is fair use, it's classic fair use, like inside fair use.

339
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,970
Speaker 3:  If you are just a creator being like, look at this cool play, you,

340
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,770
Speaker 3:  you kind of have to fight your way through it, right? And like most individual

341
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,250
Speaker 3:  creators, like we've been talking about, the infrastructure to have that

342
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,610
Speaker 3:  fight does not exist for them. Especially if you're like a new creator. So

343
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,130
Speaker 3:  YouTube content ID and like the platform, like they don't wanna have this

344
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,850
Speaker 3:  fight at scale with the sports leagues who might all become lucrative partners

345
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,650
Speaker 3:  in the future. So they just clamp down on it and you, you just, you just

346
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,570
Speaker 3:  kinda like see that that back and forth dynamic happen all over the place.

347
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,090
Speaker 3:  Whereas You know a bigger company, an E S P N or a

348
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,290
Speaker 3:  Fox or whatever, like has an infrastructure

349
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,130
Speaker 3:  to like push forward the fair use argument.

350
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,370
Speaker 3:  And so like, okay, that makes sense. It should be, it should be like I, if

351
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,970
Speaker 3:  you, if you are like a wealth, an independently wealthy YouTube sports creator

352
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,330
Speaker 3:  can probably solve this problem. Yeah. But like most YouTube

353
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,410
Speaker 3:  creators are afraid to like try 'cause they'd rather just make the next

354
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,210
Speaker 3:  video and make money instead of spending money fighting the NFL.

355
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,690
Speaker 4:  Well, and the take down notice is always terrifying. Even if you're like,

356
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,850
Speaker 4:  I'm in the right. It's like, nope, this is terrifying. I have to burn my

357
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,000
Speaker 4:  entire account and walk away. Not that I have any experience with that.

358
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,400
Speaker 3:  And, and You know the YouTube notice and take down is all in D M C A, so

359
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,240
Speaker 3:  it's all compliance to that and it basically kicks you out into like go

360
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,800
Speaker 3:  have a lawsuit and come back and tell us how it went. Like it, like YouTube

361
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,760
Speaker 3:  itself is not there to mediate the problem with you. They're there to comply

362
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,600
Speaker 3:  with the D M C A, which is to say there was a notice like of a take

363
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,240
Speaker 3:  down and you can appeal the take down and like we'll do a thing and like

364
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,200
Speaker 3:  sort of at the end of that rainbow is, did you call your lawyer? And

365
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,040
Speaker 3:  once you get there you're like, I'm just gonna make 'em the next video. Like

366
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,960
Speaker 3:  screw it, right? Because if you get You know a number of strikes your channel

367
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,720
Speaker 3:  gets to, it's the whole thing. And like I said, like big companies can solve

368
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,920
Speaker 3:  this problem. Individual creators definitely can't. So it is like kind of

369
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,720
Speaker 3:  great that YouTube realize like, oh, we don't just want this in

370
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,640
Speaker 3:  our cable bundle, we want this on YouTube. And they created

371
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,080
Speaker 3:  some financial relationships so that you can use this stuff like you can

372
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,640
Speaker 3:  use music. I'm just very curious to see how the NFL

373
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,680
Speaker 3:  reacts to lots and lots of YouTube creators using NFL clips,

374
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,240
Speaker 3:  the way that they use music. 'cause that is an uncontrolled environment and

375
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,880
Speaker 3:  we have no idea if the YouTube is gonna put guardrails on it.

376
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's, yeah, we, there's, there's a lot we still don't know. And the

377
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,160
Speaker 5:  season starts I think like September 7th. So I think what's available on

378
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,040
Speaker 5:  that first day versus what's available at the end of the season, I suspect

379
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,720
Speaker 5:  it's gonna end up pretty different. Yeah. But I'm very curious to see.

380
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,800
Speaker 3:  So that's one part of YouTube. And then on the other side of YouTube, on

381
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,640
Speaker 3:  the short side, they're adding more samples. So they're adding more music.

382
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,280
Speaker 3:  A big part of the TikTok like win has been its relationship

383
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,240
Speaker 3:  to the music industry and breaking new records, breaking new sounds, planet

384
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,840
Speaker 3:  of the base. It's like a thing that is happening because of TikTok. So YouTube

385
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,640
Speaker 3:  music is chasing after that. And then sort of next to all of that,

386
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:34,280
Speaker 3:  more governments are banning TikTok. So N Y C has banned TikTok and

387
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,760
Speaker 3:  city owned devices. It tracks lots of other cities and states. And then

388
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:42,520
Speaker 3:  Cranz, you had an incredible reaction to this headline and Nielsen

389
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,640
Speaker 3:  released some data saying, okay, TV viewing is officially down. Like

390
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,600
Speaker 3:  people watching linear TV is now half the people

391
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,640
Speaker 4:  My fury.

392
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,600
Speaker 3:  And you were like, fuck this headline, what is going on there?

393
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,200
Speaker 4:  Okay, so so the headline is, is like, it's accurate.

394
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,360
Speaker 5:  I'm not even sure I agree with that to

395
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,320
Speaker 4:  Be honest. The but there's a big asterisk, there's a huge, huge

396
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,120
Speaker 4:  asterisk in that this is all coming from data

397
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,600
Speaker 4:  that they only started gathering two years ago. So like

398
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,720
Speaker 4:  all time asterisk, we only started doing this two years ago.

399
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,480
Speaker 4:  Okay.

400
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:18,880
Speaker 3:  The

401
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,160
Speaker 4:  Technically I feel like Nielsen would, pr would come to me and be like, this

402
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,000
Speaker 4:  is technically accurate. And I'd be like, it is, but also it's not,

403
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,160
Speaker 5:  It's accurate, but it's meaningless. Like, and, and honestly, and

404
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,000
Speaker 5:  we, we've talked about this a bunch, but there was also this like big financial

405
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,800
Speaker 5:  time story the other day that was like, streaming is officially more expensive

406
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,400
Speaker 5:  than cable. And it's like, well, okay sure, if you have this gigantic list

407
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,200
Speaker 5:  of streaming services and if you have this made up promotional price for

408
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,120
Speaker 5:  cable that no one actually has, sure. Streaming is more expensive than cable.

409
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,920
Speaker 5:  Congratulations. But we're at this point where like to me,

410
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,240
Speaker 5:  all of this has proven, and this like goes along with what a lot of people

411
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,080
Speaker 5:  in the strike have been talking about with data transparency and stuff. Nobody

412
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,840
Speaker 5:  knows anything. Yep. We don't know the Nielsen is the best

413
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,760
Speaker 5:  thing we have and was reasonably good when most

414
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,000
Speaker 5:  people watched all of their television sitting on their couch in front of

415
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,320
Speaker 5:  their television. Even then it was a mess, but it was, it was good enough.

416
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,800
Speaker 5:  Now it's like, it, it gets this one tiny sliver of how people

417
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,080
Speaker 5:  experience entertainment. It doesn't capture mobile very well. It doesn't

418
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,880
Speaker 5:  capture a huge, a portion of how people spend

419
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,800
Speaker 5:  their lives. And to me, I don't take anything away from any of this

420
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,160
Speaker 5:  data except that like, people watch lots of tv, lots of places and nobody

421
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,160
Speaker 5:  knows anything.

422
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,120
Speaker 3:  This is my, my theory, my underlying theory of the television industry is

423
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,040
Speaker 3:  that no one knows how to measure anything. I I think

424
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,960
Speaker 5:  That's right. All,

425
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,800
Speaker 3:  All the metrics are fake and agreeing to measure everything in the same way

426
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,560
Speaker 3:  is a nuclear bomb waiting to go off for this industry.

427
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,560
Speaker 5:  Well, and ironically now where we are is the streamers know,

428
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,040
Speaker 5:  like Netflix knows and is increasingly

429
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,440
Speaker 5:  disincentivized to tell anybody because like if nobody knows anything

430
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,920
Speaker 3:  You know Netflix is gonna do because of the ads that Netflix is doing,

431
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,680
Speaker 3:  they're gonna do something with Nielsen. Right. Or Nielsen wants that contract.

432
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,800
Speaker 3:  Which one of the reasons I think that this headline came out fair. Right?

433
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,360
Speaker 3:  The headline basically is like the streamers won and then they're gonna walk

434
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,640
Speaker 3:  into Netflix offices Yeah. And be like, Hey, we just said you won. Like,

435
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,440
Speaker 3:  do you want us to measure? By the way, disclosure, speaking of disclosures

436
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,000
Speaker 3:  and transparency, we made a Netflix show. I'm a Netflix

437
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,280
Speaker 3:  cp, you should go watch that show. Someone wrote us a very nice email asking

438
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,280
Speaker 3:  if we're allowed to talk about our Netflix show during the strikes. The answer

439
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,120
Speaker 3:  is that our Netflix show wasn't a, a union production and it's also over.

440
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,720
Speaker 3:  So it, I I don't think I'm gonna be arrested, but let me know if you're in

441
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,080
Speaker 3:  one of the unions. You want me to to stop talking about the Netflix show

442
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,560
Speaker 3:  we made two years ago? Let me know. Anyway, that's one disclosure. Comcast

443
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,600
Speaker 3:  through its N B C Universal Arm is an investor in Vox Media. Our parent

444
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,200
Speaker 3:  company Alex is in the W G A. Our

445
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,080
Speaker 3:  newsroom is organized with the W G A East. I have H B O

446
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,640
Speaker 3:  I've been watching hard knocks like a maniac. It's a crime that hard knocks

447
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,120
Speaker 3:  is on at Tuesdays at 10:00 PM instead of Sundays at 9:00 PM like it should

448
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,800
Speaker 3:  be. I feel very strongly about that. That's my personal bias there. I have

449
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,080
Speaker 3:  really weird feelings about Aren Rogers right now. Is there anything else,

450
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Speaker 3:  David? I think that's it. I think those are all pretty disclosure.

451
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,320
Speaker 5:  That seems right. Yeah.

452
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,640
Speaker 3:  That's, that's like the, the solidness.

453
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
Speaker 5:  I have a TV back there that's disclosure.

454
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,040
Speaker 3:  Anyhow. Netflix is under a lot of pressure to release these ratings. So they,

455
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,120
Speaker 3:  they need to sell ads. You need to tell the advertisers how many people watch

456
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,800
Speaker 3:  your ads. That's gonna happen to H B O max that's gonna happen to Disney

457
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,160
Speaker 3:  plus they're all running these ad tiers. And that is the thing that is gonna

458
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,960
Speaker 3:  provide one set of pressures to release standardized

459
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,720
Speaker 3:  metrics so the ad market can decide where to spend their dollars.

460
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,640
Speaker 3:  And the other thing that's gonna happen is in the strikes, one of the demands

461
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,000
Speaker 3:  from all these unions is tell us what shows are successful

462
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,360
Speaker 3:  So, we can calculate our residuals more accurately and get more money.

463
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,400
Speaker 3:  And I think that's gonna place another amount of pressure that might finally

464
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,280
Speaker 3:  break this fever. But I have no idea how it's gonna play out. Well

465
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,160
Speaker 4:  It sounds like that that was some of the big dues this week was that the

466
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,200
Speaker 4:  producers said, oh yeah, we're now gonna give you more access

467
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,080
Speaker 4:  to data. We don't know all the details yet, but they, they finally agreed

468
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,920
Speaker 4:  to like, yeah, it makes sense that you guys should probably have more data,

469
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,240
Speaker 4:  which everyone knew before this, but it's nice that they

470
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,680
Speaker 4:  agree finally

471
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,800
Speaker 3:  Not to get into the mechanics of that negotiation, but the streamers were

472
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,480
Speaker 3:  going to have to give up this data to advertisers like it was going to happen

473
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,560
Speaker 3:  just because of the nature of that market. So I think this is like the, the

474
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,480
Speaker 3:  concession they were most willing to give because they, they needed to

475
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,320
Speaker 3:  standardize and synthesize all that data. The question is whether it's Nielsen

476
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,000
Speaker 3:  or para analytics or whatever, who knows. But the idea that the data needs

477
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,160
Speaker 3:  to be standardized and everyone can so everyone can understand it, that's

478
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,320
Speaker 3:  coming from the ad market that's not coming from that

479
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,920
Speaker 3:  negotiation. I think it is a good concession and a useful one to all of us.

480
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,440
Speaker 3:  But it's eventually an advertiser's gonna say, how many people saw my ad?

481
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,720
Speaker 3:  You just have to have a real answer. Okay, we should take a break. There's

482
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,320
Speaker 3:  been a, a wild ride in the first segment I have to say.

483
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,520
Speaker 3:  We're gonna take a break. We're gonna come back, we're gonna dip 25 years

Speaker 3:  into the past and talk about the iMac with Dan Seifert. Get your brains ready.

510
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:42,880
Speaker 9:  Welcome

511
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,480
Speaker 3:  Back to the show. You had a big package this week. Our friend Jason

512
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,560
Speaker 3:  Snell contributed a staffers from on The. Verge contributed this week

513
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,240
Speaker 3:  was the 25th anniversary of the iMac.

514
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,520
Speaker 3:  There's a lot to unpack. Like that means a lot of things. Yeah.

515
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,400
Speaker 9:  It means we're old

516
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,000
Speaker 3:  Means we're old. It is incredible to think that the Mac was a

517
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,720
Speaker 3:  younger platform when the iMac came out than the iPhone is now.

518
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,920
Speaker 3:  John pointed that when he linked to to Umar's visual history of the Mac.

519
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,960
Speaker 3:  So the Mac was 14 when the iMac came out. The

520
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,280
Speaker 3:  iPhone today is 16, which is just

521
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,120
Speaker 3:  bonkers to think about. Yeah. Where these respective products are and their

522
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,000
Speaker 3:  impact on the world. But the iMac really changed a lot of things.

523
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,880
Speaker 3:  Tell us about this package, Dan.

524
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,320
Speaker 9:  Yeah, so You know 25 years since the I'm first

525
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,200
Speaker 9:  iMac went on sales like August 15th, 1998. The iMac as

526
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,120
Speaker 9:  Jason really pointed out really well in his piece. It was

527
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,640
Speaker 9:  the product that really turned around the company's fortunes. It allowed

528
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,520
Speaker 9:  them, it was successful and popular enough to basically develop

529
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,960
Speaker 9:  the iPod, which then became successful, popular enough to develop the iPhone.

530
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,680
Speaker 9:  And then You know Apple becomes $3 trillion company. So

531
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,640
Speaker 9:  without the iMac, like you don't have any of that. And, and Apple at the

532
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,440
Speaker 9:  time was like very on the brink of not existing

533
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,320
Speaker 9:  anymore. And, and all of the products that had been developed

534
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,000
Speaker 9:  in the nineties were like these kind of beige boxes. Very typical looking,

535
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,040
Speaker 9:  not a whole lot of creativity or design were put into them. But then

536
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,960
Speaker 9:  when Jobs came back and teamed up with Ive, and they brought out the iMac

537
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,400
Speaker 9:  and just kind of like changed everything in terms of like the perspective

538
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,360
Speaker 9:  of what like a home or a consumer electronic in your home could

539
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,080
Speaker 9:  look like. It had this like radical design. It was a thing that was like

540
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,280
Speaker 9:  people looked at it and they wanted it. Whereas if you looked at a PC

541
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,200
Speaker 9:  at the time, you looked at it to, maybe you want to use it and like do

542
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,840
Speaker 9:  things on it, but you didn't want the object itself. It was just a box. Whereas

543
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,600
Speaker 9:  the iMac was an object. And then that design

544
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,720
Speaker 9:  was so influential and not only permeated throughout Apple's lineup

545
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,040
Speaker 9:  influencing the design of what the software looked like on Max and

546
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,520
Speaker 9:  then further on down the line. But it also made

547
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,040
Speaker 9:  translucent plastic products really popular at the turn of the century

548
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,800
Speaker 9:  all the way down to the infamous George Foreman Grill. That looks like an

549
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,080
Speaker 9:  iMac.

550
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,240
Speaker 5:  I had never seen that before until this package became a thing. And I'm

551
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,320
Speaker 5:  now obsessed with this translucent George girl.

552
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,640
Speaker 5:  It's fantastic. It is beautiful. It's the thing I want most in the world.

553
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,680
Speaker 5:  If you, if anyone listening wants to buy a new one,

554
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,120
Speaker 3:  Do not buy a used George Foreman grill. What if it's in,

555
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,120
Speaker 3:  what if it's in Mint

556
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,160
Speaker 9:  Condition and then it's got the, the bun warmer

557
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,080
Speaker 3:  A product that can never be cleaned.

558
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,120
Speaker 3:  No one has ever perfectly cleaned a George Foreman girl. No, it cannot be

559
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,640
Speaker 3:  done. I

560
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,520
Speaker 5:  Clean ours constantly and it's just fully disgusting. Wait,

561
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,280
Speaker 3:  You have today in 2023, a George Foreman girl?

562
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,640
Speaker 5:  I am reasonably confident that the George Foreman Grill I have is older

563
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,600
Speaker 5:  than both me and my wife. It was like my

564
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,480
Speaker 5:  wife's grandma's and it just somehow was in our

565
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,440
Speaker 5:  house. I don't know how it got here. Maybe

566
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,000
Speaker 3:  We should just switch this segment to George Foreman Grill. It

567
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,360
Speaker 5:  Just, I use it all the time. It's great.

568
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,800
Speaker 3:  What do you use it for? Are you making like, like stuffed burgers? Like George Foreman?

569
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,360
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

570
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:05,240
Speaker 5:  Constantly. No, it's like, I'm just saying if you have,

571
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,960
Speaker 5:  if you have leftover chicken breast and some cold bread and you wanna throw

572
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,840
Speaker 5:  it on the for girl for 90 seconds and eat lunch, Bob's your uncle. It's your

573
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,440
Speaker 3:  Panini press.

574
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah. No, but the back to the imax

575
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,760
Speaker 5:  Listen, David's recipe blog is another story for another

576
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,000
Speaker 5:  day.

577
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,560
Speaker 3:  Oh yeah. That's gonna be a success. Talk about getting the views. Put some

578
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,920
Speaker 3:  cold chicken on a 30 year old George or

579
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,840
Speaker 9:  I, I wanna hear the story about how your wife's grandmother

580
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:36,200
Speaker 9:  grew up building with the, with the George Foreman Grill.

581
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,960
Speaker 3:  Will we live or die today at lunchtime with David Pierce?

582
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,400
Speaker 5:  Do You know those things that just end up in your house? You're like, I didn't

583
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,480
Speaker 5:  buy this. I never asked for this. Yeah, I just have this now. Yeah, that's,

584
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,400
Speaker 5:  that's the Foreman grill in my house. Like it's George Foreman himself might

585
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,760
Speaker 5:  have brought it to our house for all I know. Like I sincerely don't know.

586
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,760
Speaker 5:  But the thing about the iMac that most blew my mind, Dan was

587
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,560
Speaker 5:  like reading Jason's piece, the, the full like YOLO

588
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,640
Speaker 5:  energy of this thing from Apple in 1998 where they're just

589
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,080
Speaker 5:  like, oh you want a floppy disc? Screw you U S B,

590
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,520
Speaker 5:  you want a thing that looks like a computer? No, here's this weird

591
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:17,160
Speaker 5:  Pixar looking piece of nonsense. There's just like, you just get this

592
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,400
Speaker 5:  vibe from Apple that I kind of love where they're like, look, we know if

593
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,160
Speaker 5:  this doesn't work, we're screwed. And realistically we're probably screwed

594
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,280
Speaker 5:  anyway. So like here's the weirdest thing we can think of. Do you like it?

595
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,120
Speaker 5:  It's got a handle. And people did exactly.

596
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,640
Speaker 3:  Well So, we, I was talking about this on Instagram threads with a few people,

597
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,920
Speaker 3:  You know people are keep saying they want a desktop version of Instagram

598
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,960
Speaker 3:  threads. This is like the thing everyone said, we say it. Mark Zuckerberg

599
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,080
Speaker 3:  is replying to JP Peters saying it's coming soon. 'cause we say it a lot.

600
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,240
Speaker 3:  That's a real thing that happened this week. What they mean is a web version,

601
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,920
Speaker 3:  right? Yeah. The the desktop application default that most people

602
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,760
Speaker 3:  think about is a web app is for, especially for a platform like Instagram

603
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,240
Speaker 3:  Threads. No one is out here asking for like a native win 32

604
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,040
Speaker 3:  Instagram threads application. I

605
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,680
Speaker 9:  Mean I was, I I would like a native app, but

606
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,960
Speaker 3:  Yeah, but that's like a very small, it's just like not the thing

607
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,560
Speaker 3:  people are asking if, if Instagram's response was you can run the iPhone

608
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,560
Speaker 3:  app on your Mac using Apple silicon. Some nerds would be

609
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,000
Speaker 3:  very happy and most people are like, what the hell is this? I just wanna

610
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,840
Speaker 3:  run at my browser. And Apple in particular with the

611
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,240
Speaker 3:  iMac, that was the moment that that began,

612
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,810
Speaker 3:  right? Until that computer desktop applications on

613
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,770
Speaker 3:  computers were one generally not connected, right? The web

614
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,480
Speaker 3:  was just starting. That was the Wintel monopoly, the height of the Wintel

615
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,120
Speaker 3:  monopoly. Even like a M D in that moment was not like a serious competitor

616
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,800
Speaker 3:  to Intel. So you had win 32 and you had Intel and that was the

617
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,720
Speaker 3:  application environment for 99% of everything. And

618
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,520
Speaker 3:  the Mac was this like RU platform that Microsoft sort of openly talked about

619
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,440
Speaker 3:  supporting. So they wouldn't be a monopoly. Like they're

620
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,880
Speaker 3:  like, as long as we have this competitor, we won't get sued by the Justice

621
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,800
Speaker 3:  Department. Little did they know this is like, this is a lot like,

622
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,800
Speaker 3:  and in that moment Apple basically said there's this idea of a network

623
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,760
Speaker 3:  computer. And the You know the original vision was like a $500 terminal with

624
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,760
Speaker 3:  just a web browser, which we finally got into with like Chrome boxes. But

625
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,720
Speaker 3:  that was like sort of the genesis and it got bigger 'cause I couldn't really

626
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,160
Speaker 3:  build it then. But no floppy drive was so you could send files

627
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:24,160
Speaker 3:  radical idea at the time they were like entire issues of Mac World that were

628
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,840
Speaker 3:  like, how will we survive?

629
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,960
Speaker 4:  I think that was like Walt Mossbergs one criticism of it in his review Yeah.

630
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,160
Speaker 4:  Was like, no floppy dis this is

631
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,160
Speaker 3:  Bullshit. And then importantly, the reason that it was a

632
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,960
Speaker 3:  viable product to sell to people was that they were like, you can just

633
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,760
Speaker 3:  plug it into the internet and use the web. Which is the thing you want.

634
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,720
Speaker 3:  You don't want Microsoft Word running on an Intel

635
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,600
Speaker 3:  processor on Windows. You want a web browser that can bring you all

636
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,120
Speaker 3:  this cool web stuff. And if not for the web and web

637
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,200
Speaker 3:  standards, this computer is a gargantuan flock. Right?

638
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,120
Speaker 3:  It looked cool as hell. It dropped all the bullshit. You only really had

639
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,800
Speaker 3:  to plug in what two wires. Like that was a very famous commercial. Like you

640
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,920
Speaker 3:  plug it in and there's no step three Jeff Goldblum, like that whole thing,

641
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,560
Speaker 3:  it signed you up for internet access through an I S P. And then you could

642
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,320
Speaker 3:  just like run a web restaurant and now we're just 25 years later,

643
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,360
Speaker 3:  people are like, I want a desktop version of Instagram threads and they mean

644
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,280
Speaker 3:  a web app. And you, there's just a straight line from that idea to, to

645
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,600
Speaker 3:  this idea that I, I think we often underestimate,

646
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:31,440
Speaker 3:  like that's the revolution. The phone is very important.

647
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,840
Speaker 3:  It just came at the, it's just the last piece of that puzzle. The

648
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,600
Speaker 3:  first one was, oh, we can sell a computer that basically runs a web browser

649
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:44,360
Speaker 3:  and like if we do a good job of that, we can become the apple that we are

650
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:44,560
Speaker 3:  today.

651
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,800
Speaker 5:  Which is why like the Johnny Ive thing became so important,

652
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,480
Speaker 5:  right? Like they timed giving a new crap about

653
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,360
Speaker 5:  design perfectly. Because like, I, I think Jason has this line on his

654
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,680
Speaker 5:  piece that's like on the internet, nobody knew you were using a Mac and I

655
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,880
Speaker 5:  love that because it's it's true. And it's like, oh, you could just buy the

656
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,120
Speaker 5:  computer that looked cool and was blue and had a handle and all the

657
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,080
Speaker 5:  stuff you wanted to do on the internet. You could still do. And it was like

658
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:14,120
Speaker 5:  Apple being a hardware company worked for it in a

659
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,960
Speaker 5:  sort of unique way in that moment because it had no ecosystem play. It was

660
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,440
Speaker 5:  like we all we can do is build a cool thing and hope that people want to

661
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,120
Speaker 5:  use it because we don't have any other moves.

662
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,840
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The power PC G three, have you heard of it? It's,

663
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,160
Speaker 3:  we're gonna, we're gonna walk away from this as fast as we can and like You

664
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,320
Speaker 3:  know all that stuff is really hard for them. Like I, I I think, think we

665
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,960
Speaker 3:  underestimate how You know apple's very good at processor transitions now

666
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,400
Speaker 3:  we take it for granted. They're like, we're gonna run the max on apple silicon.

667
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,040
Speaker 3:  And we're like, oh, you're good at this. In that moment, right? They were

668
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,560
Speaker 3:  stuck on the G three architecture. They were stuck with o the I'm at lunch

669
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,600
Speaker 3:  with OSS nine, which if you, oh wow, I am old.

670
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,120
Speaker 3:  That was not a good operating system.

671
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,520
Speaker 4:  It was sweet. What are you talking about? You could customize your text.

672
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,800
Speaker 3:  You could, this is an operating system that famously until the very end,

673
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,960
Speaker 3:  you could bring the entire OSS to a dead

674
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,240
Speaker 3:  halt by holding down the mouse button.

675
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,280
Speaker 3:  And that was like by design. Like it di was not a native

676
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,480
Speaker 3:  multitasking multi-threaded oss. I think until the

677
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:21,480
Speaker 3:  very, very end of OSS nine, you could be like, You know what? I just need

678
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,080
Speaker 3:  to everyone stop for a second. And you're just like, hold down the mask button

679
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,440
Speaker 3:  and be like, we're waiting, we're waiting everyone chill the fuck out. Like

680
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,360
Speaker 3:  we're waiting. We like, and they had to do OSS 10, like

681
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,240
Speaker 3:  all this stuff they had to do, but they needed to sell enough iMac to, to

682
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,160
Speaker 3:  get there. That kind of brings us to where the iMac is today. Right. That,

683
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,680
Speaker 3:  that's a history. I will say that we, we, you should look at the visual history

684
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,320
Speaker 3:  that we did and we should all stop and take a moment and

685
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,880
Speaker 3:  recognize the iMac G four as the pinnacle of computer design. Are

686
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,600
Speaker 4:  You crazy?

687
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:54,120
Speaker 5:  Wait, can I, can I tell you a story about the iMac G four? Yeah. So I

688
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,080
Speaker 5:  bought, let's see, this is probably 2011. I bought an

689
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,120
Speaker 5:  iMac G four because it was the only Mac I could afford, which you, you

690
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,040
Speaker 5:  will, you will realize if you do math that it's a nine year old computer

691
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,360
Speaker 5:  that is long since out of day that no one is caring about it.

692
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,920
Speaker 5:  It was, this is the only Mac I could afford. I bought it from a stranger

693
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,880
Speaker 5:  on Craigslist. We met oh my god in I believe it was Union

694
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,720
Speaker 5:  Square and he literally like went

695
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,040
Speaker 5:  through an existential crisis giving me this computer that I think I paid

696
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,840
Speaker 5:  like $150 for. Yeah. 'cause he wanted it

697
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,200
Speaker 5:  so bad and regretted so immediately selling this thing to me

698
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,440
Speaker 5:  that literally like as he was handing it to me was like, ah, but it's

699
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,280
Speaker 5:  so I just, I don't need it. But like, ah, I love it and it's just,

700
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,880
Speaker 5:  and I was like, yeah, like that's, that's why I want it too. Like I want

701
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,720
Speaker 5:  this old ass computer 'cause it's so cool looking. The, the G four was

702
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,600
Speaker 5:  my first ever Mac period and it was so old and

703
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,520
Speaker 5:  so useless at that point. And I loved it to pieces because it was

704
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,200
Speaker 5:  so cool looking. It was just it the, I

705
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,800
Speaker 5:  genuinely think it, I agree with you. I think it's the best looking computer

706
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,520
Speaker 5:  ever made. I loved that thing. It's

707
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,360
Speaker 9:  A shame they only did it for one generation. Like it was, it lasted for like

708
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,560
Speaker 9:  a year and a half or so and then boom right onto what

709
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,120
Speaker 9:  ultimately looked like a big iPod.

710
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,800
Speaker 3:  Oh wait, I have a story to tell about that. But Cranz, I, I want to hear

711
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,600
Speaker 3:  your bad opinion about the iMac G four.

712
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:19,520
Speaker 4:  Like did you guys have to use that G four iMac?

713
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,800
Speaker 3:  Yeah, David used it. I mean he still used, it's right next to his George Foreman

714
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,120
Speaker 3:  grill,

715
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,520
Speaker 3:  but he used,

716
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,440
Speaker 5:  It's a family heirloom

717
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,920
Speaker 4:  At the time because it was not great. Like, I don't know, the

718
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,440
Speaker 4:  G three was just, there was something much more charming about the G three

719
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,480
Speaker 4:  imax, like the big CRTs and everything. Well

720
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,360
Speaker 9:  I think that the, the G three was almost like

721
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,360
Speaker 9:  cartoon-like, and then the G four was a much more

722
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,360
Speaker 9:  serious, this is the future looking thing.

723
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:49,240
Speaker 3:  Hold on. We, we gotta get this timeline right. There's the original IMAX

724
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,640
Speaker 3:  responded blue, then there was the, the, the rainbow ones,

725
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,760
Speaker 3:  right where the, the five colors, those are the ones you might be talking

726
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,200
Speaker 3:  about. Alex.

727
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,200
Speaker 5:  That's the G three thing.

728
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,600
Speaker 4:  That's what I had.

729
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,440
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah. That's the MX G three. Then there was a bizarre interregnum

730
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:06,000
Speaker 3:  where Steve Jobs got on a stage and So, we have some exciting new iMac to

731
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,760
Speaker 3:  offer you today. And everyone thought he was gonna do a flat panel iMac.

732
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,560
Speaker 3:  And he was like, these motherfuckers are called Dalmatian and Flower

733
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:12,880
Speaker 3:  Power.

734
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. What

735
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:18,240
Speaker 3:  Literally people were like, what are you talking about? And that was

736
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,160
Speaker 3:  like the last gasp of that shape. Go look at a blue

737
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,360
Speaker 3:  dalmatian iMac.

738
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,400
Speaker 4:  It's beautiful.

739
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,640
Speaker 3:  They they cannot be found. Oh my,

740
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,480
Speaker 5:  This is the ugliest thing I've ever seen.

741
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,000
Speaker 3:  Like Apple went across the world and country

742
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:36,360
Speaker 3:  collected them all and was like you memory hole this Steve

743
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,880
Speaker 3:  Jobs famously walked off of stage when he announced those things after

744
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,800
Speaker 3:  sensing the vibe in the room and said it should have been fucking ready.

745
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,680
Speaker 3:  And what he meant was the flat panel iMac should have been ready. Yeah. This

746
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,080
Speaker 3:  is a real thing. You can go look this up.

747
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,880
Speaker 5:  I just googled this and I'm looking at these for the first time in my life

748
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,520
Speaker 5:  and first of all, everyone should do this and look at these because these

749
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,840
Speaker 5:  are incredible. And what these look like to me is if somebody took a normal

750
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,680
Speaker 5:  iMac and then like You know those really awful like dollar 99

751
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:05,800
Speaker 5:  skins you can buy on your phone that, that like from Amazon that

752
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,080
Speaker 5:  you, you just like apply to the back of your phone and they don't quite stick.

753
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,640
Speaker 5:  Right. And it's very clear that somebody just like took a picture of a picture

754
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,560
Speaker 5:  of a picture of a wallpaper and then put it on this. That's what this looks

755
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:16,960
Speaker 5:  like to me.

756
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,760
Speaker 3:  They are nuts. We had them in my computer lab in college

757
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,800
Speaker 3:  and they are nuts. Like they're just

758
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,560
Speaker 4:  So I was gonna say I was, I was in college around the same time and I had

759
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,080
Speaker 4:  to do it. So I had to like work on everybody's computers. That's, that's

760
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,480
Speaker 4:  what my piece on the iMac is about.

761
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,120
Speaker 3:  Is this why we vibe? 'cause we are both like college IT people.

762
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We were both like, we,

763
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
Speaker 3:  I don't think we've ever really talked about this, but I've known it in my

764
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,480
Speaker 3:  heart for quite some time. Yeah. That

765
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,160
Speaker 4:  It's why, it's why, that's why we, we always judge David. He,

766
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,520
Speaker 4:  he was in high school being like, oh boy,

767
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,400
Speaker 5:  Jesus, where did that just come from?

768
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:50,360
Speaker 3:  Damn. That's just like David took a shot.

769
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,840
Speaker 5:  I was out just like partying and getting laid. Sorry guys.

770
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,720
Speaker 4:  We had computers to talk about. We

771
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,800
Speaker 4:  were having a great time over there.

772
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,840
Speaker 5:  Dan suspiciously quiet on what he was doing at this period.

773
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,280
Speaker 9:  I I was an IT person in high school.

774
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,280
Speaker 3:  Here we go.

775
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,040
Speaker 4:  That's where were, where the cool kids,

776
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,680
Speaker 9:  I had a job, a high school job as a, an a PC tech for a local

777
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,040
Speaker 9:  hospital.

778
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,960
Speaker 3:  I think it's very obvious that this group of people was nerds in high school.

779
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,960
Speaker 3:  Alex continue your story and David,

780
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,440
Speaker 4:  But, but no, you could tell like basically how much people's

781
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,310
Speaker 4:  parents spent on them for school based on which generation of, of

782
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,440
Speaker 4:  IAC they had. So if somebody comes in with a Bondi Blue, you're like, Ooh,

783
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,480
Speaker 4:  you got the hand me down. Huh? They had like the blueberry or something.

784
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,840
Speaker 4:  You're like, okay, okay. And then they had that Dalmatian one, you were like,

785
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,360
Speaker 4:  wow, you are loaded.

786
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:48,160
Speaker 3:  This is a straight class system based on iMac colors that you have

787
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,160
Speaker 3:  imposed on, on your customers in the college it shop. There was like a middle

788
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,600
Speaker 3:  period that we haven't talked about, like the iMac DV where the shells got

789
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,320
Speaker 3:  clear. It was all cool, but I'm just saying that was the last version. And

790
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,960
Speaker 3:  then this is the thing I wanted to say about the G four. It was a Steve Jobs

791
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,880
Speaker 3:  moment unlike any other where they released the iMac G four and he

792
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,640
Speaker 3:  was like, everyone else solves this flat panel computer problem by putting

793
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,960
Speaker 3:  the computer behind the display. And he, he did the thing, he like put up

794
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,760
Speaker 3:  a bad version of that drawing and he was like, this isn't the right idea.

795
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,760
Speaker 3:  We made it a sunflower. And the thing was on the cover of Time magazine,

796
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,080
Speaker 3:  I think it was a Stephen Levy piece on the cover of Time Magazine and Jobs

797
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,040
Speaker 3:  and Johnny, I've told an entire story in Time Magazine about how they

798
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,480
Speaker 3:  were trying to solve this problem of where the computer should go at the

799
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,240
Speaker 3:  flat panel. And they were walking and they saw Sunflower and the, the

800
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,840
Speaker 3:  birds sang and Johnny looked at Steve and Steve looked at Johnny

801
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,680
Speaker 3:  and they were like, we did it. And then 18 months later, like we put the

802
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,040
Speaker 3:  computer behind the display because that's the kids passionately in front

803
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:44,280
Speaker 3:  of the,

804
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,360
Speaker 3:  but it's like they sold that thing so completely

805
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,360
Speaker 3:  until they were ready to do it the right way. And then they dropped it like

806
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,680
Speaker 3:  a stone. They're like, we actually solved the problem. And here here's the

807
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,520
Speaker 3:  thing you've always wanted. And it has been that thing ever since. And just

808
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,440
Speaker 3:  that thing where they so completely bought into

809
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,080
Speaker 3:  the solution they had at the minute until they were ready to do it the way

810
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,760
Speaker 3:  they wanted and then they never talked about it again. They what?

811
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:16,000
Speaker 3:  Dead, dead to the world. Like no company

812
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,120
Speaker 3:  can do that now. Like even Apple basically cannot do that

813
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,640
Speaker 3:  anymore. Right? They, there are too many installed devices. There are too

814
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,320
Speaker 3:  many old things to support. They're like all this stuff to be like for

815
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,120
Speaker 3:  18 months we talked about sunflowers.

816
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,190
Speaker 3:  Never remember that again. Erase the sunflowers from your

817
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,950
Speaker 3:  brain. Now it's a white piece of a white rectangle and that's the future

818
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:42,750
Speaker 3:  of the amac. To me it's like in, in the history of the iMac, that

819
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,630
Speaker 3:  moment is more about Apple's culture than anything else. And

820
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:50,030
Speaker 3:  it, it's sort of like unremarked upon because no, they, they successfully

821
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:53,750
Speaker 3:  memory hold the iMac G four. But it was that shift that I was like, oh, they

822
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:57,430
Speaker 3:  are ruthless. Like they are ruthless about getting to the right answer

823
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:01,510
Speaker 3:  as fast as they can and not talking about everything they did in the past

824
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:06,350
Speaker 3:  to this day. Like you think about a car company Ford's like, we made

825
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:10,270
Speaker 3:  another Bronco. Like it looks like the old Bronco, like here's yet

826
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:14,150
Speaker 3:  another Mustang. Like most companies are very excited to

827
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:17,790
Speaker 3:  trade on their past in a way that Apple like maybe a little bit more

828
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:21,750
Speaker 3:  recently. But you will note Apple said nothing about 25 years to the

829
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,230
Speaker 3:  iMac. Yeah, it just came and went. They had, they

830
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:27,830
Speaker 9:  Had two opportunities to say it this year, the announcement in May and then

831
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:31,960
Speaker 9:  the in-store in August, which is when we timed our pie. But yeah,

832
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,680
Speaker 9:  not a peep.

833
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:36,640
Speaker 3:  Yeah, and I, and I think it's all of that Apple culture is

834
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,880
Speaker 3:  pinpointed in that moment where literally this computer was on the cover

835
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,000
Speaker 3:  of Time Magazine and then 18 months later they're like, here's the, here's

836
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,360
Speaker 3:  the white one you wanted. And like that was it. Like the end,

837
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,840
Speaker 3:  we have this other piece here. It's really about the future of the iMac,

838
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,720
Speaker 3:  right? Yeah. Like where does it go now? It's, it's in a weird spot. Yeah.

839
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,560
Speaker 9:  Yeah. So Monica wrote a really great piece on You know nowadays

840
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:01,760
Speaker 9:  Apple's Mac business is 75 or 80% laptops

841
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,880
Speaker 9:  and then the rest is like really niche computers. The Mac

842
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,360
Speaker 9:  Studio, the Mac Mini, and then there's the iMac, which was updated

843
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,520
Speaker 9:  in spring 2021 with the M one chip. It's got the new design

844
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,800
Speaker 9:  and it's basically just been parked for like two and a half years now.

845
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,040
Speaker 9:  We've got M two chips and other laptops or other Mac computers. It's not

846
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,760
Speaker 9:  in the iMac for whatever reason, but like the iMac has been this

847
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,800
Speaker 9:  kind of thing that just kind of ebbs and flows for the past decade or so.

848
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:32,640
Speaker 9:  Like Apple will release and update and then ignore it for like four

849
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,280
Speaker 9:  years. And Then, we get an iMac Pro and then it gets ignored for four years

850
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,520
Speaker 9:  and then it Then, we get a new M one iMac and then it gets ignored for however

851
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,200
Speaker 9:  many years. So You know, Monica's takeaway was ultimately that like

852
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:48,560
Speaker 9:  Apple isn't dishing the iMac or getting rid of the iMac. That's just

853
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,440
Speaker 9:  kind of the way, the place that the iMac sits in today's

854
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,040
Speaker 9:  apple is just much less prominent and less

855
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:00,560
Speaker 9:  influential than it was two decades ago, or certainly two and a half decades

856
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:04,560
Speaker 9:  ago. So it's just like a different product. What's interesting to me is

857
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,160
Speaker 9:  that the original iMac that we talked about, and all the

858
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,080
Speaker 9:  generations after that were basically safe for the iMac pro pitched

859
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,000
Speaker 9:  as consumer products and consumer computers. And the current iMac is still

860
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,720
Speaker 9:  kind of pitched as that consumer computer, whereas the other Mac

861
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,280
Speaker 9:  desktops are really pitched towards professional creative

862
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:27,560
Speaker 9:  niche use cases. But Apple doesn't really talk about the iMac all

863
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,360
Speaker 9:  that often outside of, its like initial Launch when they showed yellow iMac

864
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,000
Speaker 9:  in kitchens, which is a very odd place to put an iMac, especially

865
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,400
Speaker 3:  That it doesn't have a touchscreen.

866
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,960
Speaker 9:  Doesn't have a touchscreen. Yeah, no, you, you need your, your touch pad,

867
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,720
Speaker 9:  your track pad and keyboard in addition to your iMac in your kitchen. Oh,

868
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,480
Speaker 5:  Can I run a theory by you guys that I think is right, but have no

869
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,680
Speaker 5:  actual data for just lots of anecdotal evidence? I would

870
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,200
Speaker 5:  bet that people keep IMAX longer

871
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:59,080
Speaker 5:  than any other single Apple product

872
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:03,400
Speaker 5:  like I would bet the average use lifespan of an iMac

873
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:07,800
Speaker 5:  is the longest of any other Mac because the, the screen is very

874
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,280
Speaker 5:  good. The thing works relatively well. You're not gonna notice when the battery

875
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,560
Speaker 5:  starts to give out, which is often the first thing that goes in a lot of

876
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,400
Speaker 5:  laptops and the like, inertia of upgrading

877
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,280
Speaker 5:  is so big because it's just the whole thing. If I have a desktop,

878
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,520
Speaker 5:  if I like wanna upgrade the Mac Mini, I'm sitting here with, I can keep everything

879
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,320
Speaker 5:  else I have and just slot in a new Mac mini upgrading your

880
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,400
Speaker 5:  iMac is like upgrading your whole office all at once. And also, like you

881
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,800
Speaker 5:  said, Dan, these are consumer things that people are like, this is like the

882
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,520
Speaker 5:  familys computer that Apple has, right? And I think

883
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,800
Speaker 5:  if you, if you have like a 2011 iMac that's just like sitting in your den,

884
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:46,600
Speaker 5:  the like leap to upgrade that is huge.

885
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,160
Speaker 5:  And the reasons to upgrade that when it's like a pretty good screen and the

886
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,760
Speaker 5:  only thing that's really wrong with it 12 years later is that it's like pretty

887
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,680
Speaker 5:  slow. My guess would be that like the average lifespan of one

888
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,640
Speaker 5:  of those things is just absolutely off the charts. And if I'm Apple, I'm

889
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,240
Speaker 5:  looking at that and saying, well, I'm gonna sell people a computer. They're

890
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,080
Speaker 5:  gonna upgrade once every Yeah. 11 years. I,

891
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,360
Speaker 5:  I'd rather sell them a MacBook that they're gonna want a new one in three.

892
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:12,120
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You know what people do with their MacBook errors. They drop them

893
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,440
Speaker 3:  straight, like they

894
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,800
Speaker 5:  Spill things on them. Why

895
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,960
Speaker 4:  The battery, the battery part of this is, is the big, like that's a big part

896
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,840
Speaker 4:  of this is 'cause those batteries go and, and you can't replace them on,

897
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,440
Speaker 4:  on newer laptops and stuff. So it's just like your fubar, whereas

898
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:30,800
Speaker 4:  your iMac can go forever. I think somebody on this call might be

899
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,480
Speaker 4:  recording with like an ancient iMac.

900
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,440
Speaker 3:  I, I'm, I'm looking at right now, it's a, it's a 20 15 27

901
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,480
Speaker 3:  inch iMac. I will say that I, and you're,

902
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,400
Speaker 5:  You name another gadget you own that is eight years old.

903
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:49,320
Speaker 3:  The cameras are coming up on that. The D 7,500 coming up on that. Okay. But

904
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,120
Speaker 3:  that's like a, that's like an emotional, like I should upgrade

905
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,120
Speaker 3:  that camera. Like I take a lot of shit from this team for solving, having

906
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,720
Speaker 3:  that camera, but I You know it's never done me wrong. Old man still got it.

907
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,960
Speaker 3:  This computer I basically use for this. I run one web app on it. I run

908
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:07,840
Speaker 3:  Riverside to do this show and it's this setup and everything

909
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,680
Speaker 3:  plugs into it and it's fine. It is radically over

910
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,360
Speaker 3:  speced. So I, our our studio, Vox Media Studios

911
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,880
Speaker 3:  was upgrading their computers many years ago and they

912
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,480
Speaker 3:  were just gonna recycle this. And I was like, I'm taking it because we're

913
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,840
Speaker 3:  just like sitting on the curb. And I was like, can I, can I just more, and

914
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,680
Speaker 3:  they're like, don't tell anyone now I've told everyone. So it goes, but it,

915
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,320
Speaker 3:  it has, it has, well the key is that it has 32 gigs of ram and this is like

916
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:38,280
Speaker 3:  the key to longevity of every computer in my opinion is like, it is

917
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,080
Speaker 3:  just, it has massively more RAM than it needed in its time. And that means

918
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,480
Speaker 3:  it stays forever. Which is why I tell everybody who buys a Mac now that eight

919
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,440
Speaker 3:  gigs of RAM is not enough. Like that to me is more of the evidence

920
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,680
Speaker 3:  of Apple's planned obsolescence than anything else is eight gigs of soldered

921
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,800
Speaker 3:  Ram. Like, no, no, no.

922
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,120
Speaker 4:  Nope. Don't do that.

923
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,120
Speaker 3:  And it's just weird. And I, I think David, you're right, the iMac sits in

924
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,440
Speaker 3:  a lot of places. My parents have an ancient one. They refer to it as the

925
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,320
Speaker 3:  mainframe. Aw. It's, it's very good. Yes. And

926
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,160
Speaker 3:  they go to it when they want to do anything serious like

927
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:16,320
Speaker 3:  logging into the bank. Yep. Because they, they want a big screen and

928
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,640
Speaker 3:  a browser that feels safe. And I'm like, you can't

929
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,520
Speaker 4:  Use your phone. Why do parents like bank apps? Because

930
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,000
Speaker 3:  Their phone, they feel like their phone is not serious enough for logging

931
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:27,520
Speaker 3:  into the bank. Yeah. Okay. I

932
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,720
Speaker 9:  I think that what You know what you're describing Eli and what David you

933
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,400
Speaker 9:  described as like it's sitting in a den. That is like the concept, the

934
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,880
Speaker 9:  original concept of the iMac. It was a shared family computer. Yeah. And

935
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,600
Speaker 9:  it's just that at this point, at this time, that doesn't

936
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:45,080
Speaker 9:  exist as a product for a lot of people in functional ways

937
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,880
Speaker 9:  in their lives. If you've got kids in school, they're not coming home and

938
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,880
Speaker 9:  sitting at a desktop to do their homework, they're doing it on a Chromebook

939
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:54,960
Speaker 9:  that links up to their school's network or and goes with them to school.

940
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,400
Speaker 9:  Or they have their own personal devices, an iPad or an iPhone or whatever

941
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,200
Speaker 9:  smartphone. The shared concept of a family computer,

942
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,320
Speaker 9:  it's like not something that really fits into the modern day life. Whereas

943
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:10,240
Speaker 9:  the other desktops in Apple's lineup, the Mac Mini, the Mac Studio,

944
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,560
Speaker 9:  et cetera, are, they have like purposes that fit into people's lives as

945
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,400
Speaker 9:  like devices that they work on all day. But the iMac as the family

946
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,120
Speaker 9:  thing doesn't really exist anymore.

947
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:24,240
Speaker 4:  That was like, I mean the iMac itself was a response to everybody

948
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,680
Speaker 4:  had family computers like in the eighties and nineties. If you had a computer,

949
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,760
Speaker 4:  it probably wasn't in your room unless you were like just Richie Rich.

950
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,880
Speaker 4:  Right? Like you had a lot of money.

951
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,960
Speaker 3:  Alex was like, get that blue All Nation computer outta my face. Yeah,

952
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:40,040
Speaker 4:  Right. Like you didn't have that like everybody that, that

953
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,120
Speaker 4:  so, so the iMac, when the iMac came out, it was like, oh, this is a computer

954
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:46,480
Speaker 4:  where it's not just the parents using a beige box. Like the kids can interact

955
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,320
Speaker 4:  with this. Which is why my brother watched a Bug's Life on repeat

956
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:54,240
Speaker 4:  every day over and over and over again on the damn thing. And nowadays

957
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,280
Speaker 4:  computers are cheaper, they're more affordable. So, and and laptops have

958
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,200
Speaker 4:  become much, much more affordable than they were at the time. Like a laptop

959
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:05,120
Speaker 4:  was still insanely expensive at the time. I, I think

960
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,000
Speaker 4:  all of my laptops until I got out of college were hand-me-downs. 'cause

961
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,280
Speaker 4:  my parents were like, absolutely not. You do not get a brand new laptop.

962
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,080
Speaker 4:  You're gonna drop on its face and break and Then. we have to pay for it.

963
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,000
Speaker 4:  Get out and, and the but the prices have come down so it's like, it's much

964
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,760
Speaker 4:  more affordable. It's much easier to go and buy a Chromebook for a kid than

965
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,320
Speaker 4:  be like, okay, everybody's gonna use this communal computer in the living

966
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,080
Speaker 4:  room. And also like we have to have a space in our living room carved out

967
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,240
Speaker 4:  just for the computer. And then you got one kid on the computer and another

968
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,280
Speaker 4:  kid watching TV and they're all yelling at each other. And now they can just

969
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,360
Speaker 4:  all have phones and be quiet in another room. Or

970
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,840
Speaker 9:  The school dictates that they have a Chromebook, which like takes the decision

971
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,760
Speaker 9:  out of your hands entirely. And then like that iMac that you have

972
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,080
Speaker 9:  sitting there is like not used by them because it's not the tool that fits

973
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,680
Speaker 9:  into the rest of their curriculum.

974
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,080
Speaker 3:  Alex just made a, a striking case to bring back the computer room.

975
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:55,280
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Was I was just gonna say I'm in on this.

976
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,480
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I want a computer room. That was the best. Like you were always sitting

977
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,680
Speaker 4:  in like a dining room chair that you should not be sitting in

978
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,200
Speaker 4:  hunched over it.

979
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:06,720
Speaker 3:  Everybody had that horrible office. Max Furniture. Yeah. And the computer

980
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,000
Speaker 3:  You know what I'm talking about. The the desk and the hutch and the, the

981
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,600
Speaker 3:  whole thing. And you'd roll down. Here's what I want ver has listeners

982
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:16,720
Speaker 3:  send me photos of your computer rooms? Yes. Not your modern

983
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,960
Speaker 3:  gamer rooms. I mean your childhood computer rooms. If you have

984
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:24,870
Speaker 3:  such a photo. I just wanna look at 'em and maybe we'll run like a thing

985
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:28,390
Speaker 3:  about computer rooms. Who knows if they're good enough. Mine's curse

986
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,510
Speaker 3:  again. I do not want your weird gamer den with your l e d lightings and your

987
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,630
Speaker 3:  wifis. I want your 4 86 tower with a turbo

988
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:40,070
Speaker 3:  button with in Carta Open on A C R T. Hell yeah. That's the

989
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:41,670
Speaker 4:  I'm looking for exposed photo.

990
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,870
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You know exactly what I'm talking about. Show me where you came from.

991
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,710
Speaker 5:  I had a gateway with the cow logo. That was Those are the days.

992
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:53,510
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah. Give me your origin story in a photo of your

993
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:56,710
Speaker 3:  computer rooms. Alright, we should, we've talked about the iMac quite a bit.

994
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:00,190
Speaker 3:  There is an Apple event coming up where we're assuming in in September for

995
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,870
Speaker 3:  iPhones. That's a pretty solid guess given the

996
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:07,870
Speaker 3:  decade plus of iPhones coming out in September. iOS

997
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:10,270
Speaker 3:  17 betas are out. Dan, any thoughts here?

998
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:14,630
Speaker 9:  They keep moving the the end call button, which seems to be

999
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:18,430
Speaker 9:  driving people wild. I think You know. Other than that, I think iOS 17 is

1000
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:21,910
Speaker 9:  gonna be for a lot of people and we've, we've kind of said this in our preview

1001
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:25,390
Speaker 9:  coverage already, that it's gonna be a pretty small update across a lot of

1002
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:28,790
Speaker 9:  things. And some people are really gonna appreciate little things like

1003
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,910
Speaker 9:  interactive widgets.

1004
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,590
Speaker 5:  I was gonna say my one quibble with the characterization of small update

1005
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:37,510
Speaker 5:  is that every app developer that exists on the internet will

1006
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:41,070
Speaker 5:  not shut up about how excited they are about interactive widgets. It's gonna

1007
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:44,830
Speaker 5:  get full crazy with the interactive widgets and I'm very excited about it.

1008
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:45,150
Speaker 5:  Maybe

1009
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:47,950
Speaker 9:  It'll just be more exciting when it launches and those app developers can

1010
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:48,790
Speaker 9:  actually put out their work.

1011
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:52,470
Speaker 5:  Whatever Dan, you're gonna check off a to-do on the home screen of your iPhone

1012
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,190
Speaker 5:  and you're gonna freak out. It's gonna be great day.

1013
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,550
Speaker 9:  It's gonna be so great. Can't wait at the, at the, at the, at the grocery

1014
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,710
Speaker 9:  store. Checking off to-do's on my widget. Like I could, could have been doing

1015
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:00,990
Speaker 9:  on Android since 2010

1016
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:03,870
Speaker 4:  Coming.

1017
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:08,910
Speaker 9:  But yeah, I mean, o other than that it's gonna be the 17th version

1018
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:09,830
Speaker 9:  of ix.

1019
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:10,830
Speaker 3:  It's like, what,

1020
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:11,630
Speaker 4:  What are we, what

1021
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,390
Speaker 9:  Are we expecting to change here? I'm,

1022
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:17,510
Speaker 3:  I'm excited 'cause I, the autocorrect situation is bad. It has

1023
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:20,950
Speaker 3:  now that people have pointed out so consistently to us. It has gotten worse

1024
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:24,910
Speaker 3:  in a way that is impossible to measure, but it's definitely worse. And

1025
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:26,870
Speaker 3:  I just, I'm just looking forward to this update.

1026
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:27,830
Speaker 9:  The vibes are off.

1027
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,910
Speaker 3:  Gimme your l l m powered autocorrect. Like, I'll take it.

1028
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:34,590
Speaker 3:  Anything has to be better than this. It's weird, right? Have you guys noticed

1029
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,390
Speaker 3:  it's gotten worse.

1030
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,950
Speaker 4:  Everybody judges me. They always know when I'm on my phone because there's

1031
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:42,350
Speaker 4:  always at least one horrible confusing typo that like

1032
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,670
Speaker 4:  Apple was just like, no, I got you. I'm gonna change this word. It totally

1033
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:48,950
Speaker 4:  makes sense. I was like, no, it, it doesn't, it's a terrible context.

1034
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:53,230
Speaker 3:  My theory is that Apple is just trying to push us towards that

1035
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:56,630
Speaker 3:  humane AI pin. They're like, what if you don't use this computer?

1036
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,270
Speaker 3:  What if you just talk to your aunt instead?

1037
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,910
Speaker 4:  Just, Hey guys, what's up? I have thoughts about the show we're watching

1038
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:07,630
Speaker 3:  By the way, the humane AI pin. This is a totally random, they announced this

1039
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:11,350
Speaker 3:  week that they're, they're gonna Launch or do something in October

1040
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:15,590
Speaker 3:  on the day of a, of an eclipse. That's what I got for you. They put out,

1041
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,150
Speaker 3:  you should watch the video. They call out our friend Sam Scheffer in the

1042
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,790
Speaker 3:  video that always makes me smile. It's like the only time they all light

1043
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,720
Speaker 3:  up, up is when they talk to Sam. Sam's not even in the video. He is behind

1044
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,320
Speaker 3:  the camera and they're like, Sam, and they all smile. And that just made

1045
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,160
Speaker 3:  me happy. But they're like, A momentous day is coming when the

1046
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,680
Speaker 3:  sun will be blacked out forever. And then you will talk to your hand and

1047
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,480
Speaker 3:  it's like, okay, so sometime in October they're gonna release this

1048
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,680
Speaker 3:  pin and we can all see what's up.

1049
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,200
Speaker 4:  Oh the talk to the hand puns. We just gotta get those

1050
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,520
Speaker 4:  out of our systems. Or I guess it's probably just me. I just gotta get that

1051
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,120
Speaker 4:  out of my system until that it's

1052
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:52,080
Speaker 3:  Announced. I did the post about PornHub MindGeek suing

1053
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,320
Speaker 3:  a restaurant in New York City called Donor House. It's a kebab restaurant.

1054
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,160
Speaker 3:  And I was like, don't make the joke please. And everyone in the comments

1055
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:58,720
Speaker 3:  made the joke.

1056
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,360
Speaker 4:  You just let other people do it like it's right there. It's like, okay, I'm

1057
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,360
Speaker 4:  not, I'm gonna resist. Do it for me.

1058
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,600
Speaker 3:  I was like, I'm just begging you. And everyone's like, here it is. We

1059
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,160
Speaker 3:  said it, it's fine. Okay, we gotta take a break.

1060
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,720
Speaker 3:  We're gonna come back and do a lightning round with Dan. We'll be right back.

1061
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:23,430
Speaker 3:  Hi, I am Neli Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge and host of the Decoder

1062
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:27,110
Speaker 3:  podcast. This September I'm taking over as one of the new hosts of the code

1063
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:31,030
Speaker 3:  conference alongside CNBC's, Julia Borson and Casey Newton

1064
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:34,830
Speaker 3:  from Platformer and Hard Fork. You've heard us all talk to major players

1065
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:38,510
Speaker 3:  in the worlds of tech and business on our shows. But code has

1066
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:41,870
Speaker 3:  live unfiltered journalism you won't find anywhere else.

1067
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:46,110
Speaker 3:  This year we have onstage interviews with x slash Twitter, c e o, Linda Ya

1068
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:50,110
Speaker 3:  carino, Microsoft c t O, Kevin Scott, and many more. From AI

1069
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:54,030
Speaker 3:  to streaming platform shifts to privacy. No one knows exactly where

1070
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:57,470
Speaker 3:  we're headed, but code is where the world's most influential people come

1071
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:00,990
Speaker 3:  together to find out. Join us for the start of a new era.

1072
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,510
Speaker 3:  Apply to attend the code conference now at Vox

1073
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:07,230
Speaker 3:  media.com/code. That's Vox

1074
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:10,230
Speaker 3:  media.com/code. We'll see you in September.

1075
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:21,360
Speaker 3:  We are back lightning round time. There's a lot going on in this lightning

1076
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:21,560
Speaker 3:  round.

1077
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,360
Speaker 4:  So much good stuff and some like sad stuff, mainly good stuff.

1078
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,840
Speaker 3:  There's also an email where the, the subject line is htm I disgust me,

1079
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:33,480
Speaker 3:  which is just, we have found our people. Yeah,

1080
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,640
Speaker 4:  I was like, they get us, they get us.

1081
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,480
Speaker 3:  I, I keep, I I use this line that I I ruthlessly stole from Casey Newton

1082
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,640
Speaker 3:  all the time, which is anybody can get traffic but it's impossible to get

1083
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,040
Speaker 3:  an audience and it's like oh we have an audience like that. Those are,

1084
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:49,400
Speaker 3:  you have to trust us to send us that subject line.

1085
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,600
Speaker 3:  That's a relationship and I appreciate you

1086
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:58,080
Speaker 3:  Sal. It was from Sal. Anyway, his point is that DisplayPort is superior to

1087
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:02,080
Speaker 3:  HT m i because of a piece in Hackaday Hackaday by the way. I personally have

1088
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:05,200
Speaker 3:  a long history with that was there's a long intertwining of Hackaday and

1089
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:09,320
Speaker 3:  Eng Gadget back in the day. We'll link the hack Hey piece about

1090
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:13,280
Speaker 3:  DisplayPort being better but Htm, I discussed me, Sal

1091
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,360
Speaker 5:  Ends his email by saying I feel like I've been red pilled by DisplayPort.

1092
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,080
Speaker 5:  It's very, is unbelievable.

1093
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:22,640
Speaker 3:  It's a very good look. DisplayPort is packet based and I understand, I understand

1094
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,560
Speaker 3:  the point. Fine. Okay. Lightning round Cranz, you've got

1095
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,040
Speaker 3:  the best one. Take us away.

1096
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,640
Speaker 4:  Are you ever like having a dinner party with your friends

1097
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:35,400
Speaker 4:  outside and you're like, I really wanna watch some tv. So you go, you get

1098
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,240
Speaker 4:  your little suitcase out of the closet and you put it out and you watch your

1099
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,880
Speaker 4:  TV 'cause it's in the suitcase. And then later you're like, oh man, I'm going

1100
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,680
Speaker 4:  camping with the buddies. I need to watch TV on my camping trip.

1101
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:50,840
Speaker 4:  So you bring your little suitcase with you. LG was like, everybody

1102
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:54,800
Speaker 4:  needs to be able to do that. Not just people who built a suitcase tv.

1103
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,720
Speaker 4:  The rest of us need to be able to do it. So there's the 27 inch

1104
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:00,400
Speaker 4:  stand by Mego

1105
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:04,600
Speaker 5:  To be clear, not stand by me. Which would make sense.

1106
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:05,960
Speaker 4:  Stand by me stand

1107
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:10,080
Speaker 9:  And, and not, not Migo the right intel based mobile platform.

1108
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:14,480
Speaker 4:  I'm just, I'm gonna sit stand by me, make mego like I refuse to, to

1109
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:18,480
Speaker 4:  break it out into one in multiple words. It's beautiful.

1110
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,880
Speaker 4:  It can last three hours on a charge so you can get through one of

1111
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,880
Speaker 4:  the Lord of the Rings movies.

1112
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:28,240
Speaker 3:  Wait, I just, how like there's so much room for

1113
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,680
Speaker 3:  it's a suitcase.

1114
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:33,640
Speaker 9:  Wait, but it's a 27 inch street. It's huge.

1115
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,760
Speaker 5:  You guys, I have, I have a revolutionary idea. Make the suitcase

1116
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,160
Speaker 5:  bigger.

1117
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:41,200
Speaker 9:  Give me more

1118
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:41,680
Speaker 3:  Scream

1119
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,160
Speaker 5:  And more battery. No,

1120
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,920
Speaker 3:  I in a bigger suitcase, my 16 inch MacBook

1121
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:50,720
Speaker 3:  Pro with an M one Pro chip has a bigger

1122
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:53,280
Speaker 3:  battery life than this television

1123
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,760
Speaker 9:  11 inch smaller screen.

1124
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,680
Speaker 3:  You're telling me that it's just the pixels but it can run

1125
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,080
Speaker 3:  an M one chip?

1126
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:04,120
Speaker 5:  Well it runs web oss, which is probably the reason it only gets three hours.

1127
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,640
Speaker 9:  My my favorite part of LGS promotional

1128
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:12,560
Speaker 9:  images of this is it's, there's two young, very fashionable hip

1129
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:16,160
Speaker 9:  people sitting by a pool. Yes. And the guy is using the TV

1130
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:16,680
Speaker 3:  Yes.

1131
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:21,080
Speaker 9:  To skip a track on the world's largest music widget.

1132
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,480
Speaker 9:  'cause it's 27 inches in size to just go the next track.

1133
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:29,600
Speaker 9:  And then, and they didn't pay for any licensing. So

1134
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,200
Speaker 9:  the song is song titled by artist's name.

1135
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:37,800
Speaker 3:  If you, it's a b by the way. This is what I was gonna call out to. Perfect

1136
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,680
Speaker 3:  call out from Dan. If you're in your car, pull over now the link is in the

1137
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,520
Speaker 3:  show notes. Go look at this picture. When, when marketing

1138
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,120
Speaker 3:  agencies come up with briefs for products, they're like, we,

1139
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:53,760
Speaker 3:  here's what we want people to feel. Here's how we're gonna execute it.

1140
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,360
Speaker 3:  I want to know what they wanted you to feel when they

1141
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,440
Speaker 3:  executed this photo. Right. They had to do it, they had to, they had to get

1142
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:06,240
Speaker 3:  some tables, they had to get a lady with a book. They had to buy white linen

1143
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,920
Speaker 3:  clothes for this gentleman. He has a drink here. They put a lemon in it.

1144
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:14,280
Speaker 3:  They opened the suitcase. They were like, they instructed

1145
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:18,320
Speaker 3:  him to be pointing at the next track button in what looks like a clone

1146
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,160
Speaker 3:  of Apple music but is not Apple music. All of that happened

1147
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:26,040
Speaker 3:  like a series of decisions happened with intent. And

1148
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:30,000
Speaker 3:  I'm just dying to know, like, I don't believe this

1149
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:32,120
Speaker 3:  TV is a touch screen. I

1150
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:32,840
Speaker 9:  I think it is actually

1151
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,160
Speaker 3:  It, it is a touch screen

1152
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:38,360
Speaker 9:  In, in other points about this TV one, it can rotate

1153
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,760
Speaker 9:  90 degrees so you can watch TOS on it. Oh

1154
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,400
Speaker 3:  It is a touchscreen. It has table mode and Yes. And then

1155
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:47,240
Speaker 9:  You could play chess on it with the touchscreen as they show in other

1156
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:47,480
Speaker 9:  photos.

1157
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:51,600
Speaker 4:  It's got Dolby vision, it's got Dolby Atmos with four

1158
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,360
Speaker 4:  speakers.

1159
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:55,120
Speaker 3:  It's 10 80 p Dolby Vision.

1160
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:59,280
Speaker 4:  Oh that's gonna be, yeah, like you're gonna watch your one half hour of a

1161
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,840
Speaker 4:  show because you've probably forgot to charge it. So you've only got 30 minutes

1162
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:06,800
Speaker 4:  of time and you're gonna watch your 30 minutes of the nanny in Dolby vision.

1163
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,440
Speaker 9:  And it also has to get bright enough so you can actually see it outside.

1164
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:12,040
Speaker 9:  So it's gotta run at like 1200

1165
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,640
Speaker 5:  Knits. It has an outdoor picture mode which

1166
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:19,400
Speaker 5:  acknowledges the fact that you are out in the world like Neli. If we're just

1167
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,760
Speaker 5:  gonna go down the road of like, how are we marketing this thing? The the

1168
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:26,720
Speaker 5:  idea that they are giving is you're gonna bring this thing, you're gonna

1169
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,880
Speaker 5:  put it in the trunk of your car, you're gonna go camping, you're gonna open

1170
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,240
Speaker 5:  up the trunk of your car, you're gonna open up the suitcase. You're gonna,

1171
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,880
Speaker 5:  you're gonna swivel up the screen, turn it on and you're gonna put on a,

1172
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,240
Speaker 5:  a video of a quote cozy crackling fireplace

1173
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,440
Speaker 5:  while you're out camping.

1174
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,440
Speaker 4:  Is that not what you do when you camp? You don't put the iPad out

1175
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:48,120
Speaker 5:  Like, oh we could make a fire. And you say, what do you mean I've already

1176
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,320
Speaker 5:  made a fire. And you just pull the screen up and that's it.

1177
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,760
Speaker 3:  I just want to point out, if you watch their video, they're all sitting around

1178
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,520
Speaker 3:  an outdoor dining table and she opens the suitcase and

1179
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:00,600
Speaker 3:  opens the screen showing the fire

1180
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:02,520
Speaker 4:  And then makes you watch a YouTube video.

1181
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:03,640
Speaker 3:  Oh it's all very good.

1182
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,160
Speaker 5:  Do you, you say I have made fire every time. It's amazing.

1183
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:10,000
Speaker 3:  Every single person on our staff wants to buy this tv. I don't dunno why

1184
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,480
Speaker 3:  it's only a

1185
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:10,880
Speaker 4:  Thousand dollars.

1186
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,280
Speaker 3:  That's the wrong way to think about money.

1187
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:16,040
Speaker 5:  It's only a thousand dollars.

1188
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:18,840
Speaker 3:  Many, like an iPhone is a thousand dollars.

1189
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:23,040
Speaker 4:  Every outdoor dinner party is just transformed with this a

1190
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,600
Speaker 4:  thousand dollars device. But

1191
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,320
Speaker 9:  If you pre-order it, you get a free x boom 360 speaker,

1192
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:32,240
Speaker 9:  which is two $50. So really it's like the

1193
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,240
Speaker 9:  TV is free. Wait

1194
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:34,360
Speaker 5:  Basically. Yeah.

1195
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:38,320
Speaker 3:  Again, if You know what the intent of the man

1196
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:42,440
Speaker 3:  change his track on music player picture is please just like please

1197
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:46,400

1198
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:50,320
Speaker 3:  for the first person to take this as a carry on, on a plane

1199
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:51,280
Speaker 3:  and just

1200
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:52,840
Speaker 5:  Bust it out of the tray table.

1201
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,600
Speaker 3:  But yeah, just like it's gonna

1202
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,760
Speaker 9:  Happen. The T ss a will never let you get on a plane with this thing. They're

1203
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,920
Speaker 9:  gonna look at this thing and detain you for the longest time ever. Yeah,

1204
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,560
Speaker 3:  They're gonna be like, what is this music widget we need to know. Right.

1205
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,480
Speaker 5:  But you show them the fire and it's gonna be fine.

1206
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:08,960
Speaker 3:  Alright Dan, what's your, what's your lightning round?

1207
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:13,480
Speaker 9:  I'm gonna plug myself, I reviewed the three Galaxy

1208
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:17,400
Speaker 9:  Tab SS nine tablets today on the site. And I'm just gonna say it,

1209
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:19,200
Speaker 9:  Android tablets are interesting this year.

1210
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,640
Speaker 3:  Really? Yeah,

1211
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,200
Speaker 9:  They're back

1212
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:21,480
Speaker 3:  Baby.

1213
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:22,120
Speaker 4:  Finally.

1214
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:24,560
Speaker 9:  Android tablets. It's a year of Android tablets.

1215
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:26,520
Speaker 3:  When you say they're back,

1216
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:27,600
Speaker 4:  They never left,

1217
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:31,520
Speaker 3:  Do you mean that they are back in a way that is competitive with the iPad

1218
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:35,040
Speaker 3:  or back in the sense that someone is releasing them?

1219
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,040
Speaker 3:  I

1220
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,880
Speaker 9:  Would say that they are actually pretty interesting and good.

1221
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,840
Speaker 9:  This like, yeah, the, the interesting part about it is Samsung's

1222
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,840
Speaker 9:  been releasing high-end Android tablets that have been pretty decent for

1223
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,400
Speaker 9:  a few years now, but it's been only Samsung and now there's like

1224
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:55,480
Speaker 9:  actual competition within the Android space. You could buy a Pixel tablet

1225
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:59,440
Speaker 9:  or you could buy a OnePlus tablet or you could buy a Lenovo tablet

1226
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,960
Speaker 9:  or something like that. Samsung still makes the best ones, but it also makes

1227
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,400
Speaker 9:  like the most expensive ones. So there's like actual variety.

1228
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:10,040
Speaker 9:  It's, there's different ideas happening, there's different experimentation.

1229
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,560
Speaker 9:  The software's gotten a lot better. There are actual

1230
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:17,120
Speaker 9:  ecosystems that have been built out. If you're a Samsung phone owner, it

1231
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,240
Speaker 9:  makes a lot of sense to use a Samsung tablet because it works together in

1232
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,360
Speaker 9:  the way that an iPhone works with an iPad. So wait, it's

1233
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:27,000
Speaker 4:  Dan, aren't you a Samsung phone owner? I,

1234
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:27,440
Speaker 9:  I am. Do

1235
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,600
Speaker 4:  You use a Samsung tablet or do you use an iPad?

1236
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,720
Speaker 9:  I would say that nobody should buy their purchase decisions based on my own

1237
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,080
Speaker 9:  personal device choices

1238
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:36,720
Speaker 3:  Tracks.

1239
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:41,160
Speaker 9:  Because you will be entering regret.

1240
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:42,760
Speaker 3:  I've seen Dan use Dex.

1241
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,720
Speaker 9:  I I use Dex. Like, like Dex is, is is fascinating and

1242
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:51,480
Speaker 9:  like surprisingly capable at this point. It used to be a hot mess.

1243
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:55,880
Speaker 9:  But I think I, I wrote this entire piece on Dex and I spent quite

1244
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:59,000
Speaker 9:  a few days actually working on Dex to like test the, the tablets and stuff

1245
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,280
Speaker 9:  and it's You know pretty, pretty good.

1246
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:05,440
Speaker 5:  Dex is good now I spent a decade going to meetings with Samsung

1247
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:09,560
Speaker 5:  being like, You know Dex exists, right? What if you did anything to it? And

1248
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:13,360
Speaker 5:  they were like, nah, it's Dex, it's like a thing. We put in

1249
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,960
Speaker 5:  slides but no one actually uses and now they've like made it into a thing.

1250
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:20,800
Speaker 5:  You can actually like have multiple windows in a way that isn't bad

1251
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,360
Speaker 5:  on your tablet. Like what a concept it

1252
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:27,120
Speaker 9:  Feels like Stage manager, if you took all the binders

1253
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:30,920
Speaker 9:  off of Stage Manager and all the restrictions off of stage manager and you

1254
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:34,800
Speaker 9:  did the thing that you wanna do with Windows on a screen, that's what Dex

1255
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,000
Speaker 9:  is.

1256
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:38,720
Speaker 3:  Okay. I'm just gonna, Dan, I'm I'm just looking at your scores. I'm just,

1257
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,160
Speaker 3:  I'm just evaluating Enter a tablets are back. So

1258
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,800
Speaker 9:  You are a commenter on the website? Yes,

1259
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,840
Speaker 3:  I am the people. So you gave the Tab SS nine and eight, which is

1260
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:50,320
Speaker 3:  fair, although 16 by 10 is

1261
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:54,400
Speaker 9:  Yeah, that's why main complete with the S nine is 16 x 10 is still a little

1262
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:58,440
Speaker 3:  Blah. And then the SS nine Ultra, which is the one that like You

1263
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,360
Speaker 3:  know the, the YouTubers just waved around in TikTok. It'd be like, look

1264
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:06,080
Speaker 3:  at this and I got it. I was like, yep, look at that. But you gave that one

1265
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,760
Speaker 3:  a six 'cause it's gigantic and ridiculous. Yeah.

1266
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,920
Speaker 3:  And $1,200 it's

1267
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,320
Speaker 4:  More expensive than the the suitcase TV too.

1268
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:15,880
Speaker 9:  Yeah, that's true. Well it

1269
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,000
Speaker 3:  Has a processor already.

1270
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:18,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it does anything

1271
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,480
Speaker 4:  Outrageously priced

1272
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:27,760
Speaker 3:  And then the SS nine plus you gave a six and this one just

1273
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:30,080
Speaker 3:  blah. Like I don't even like looking at it,

1274
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,400
Speaker 5:  I feel like there's, there's required to be one tablet in every

1275
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:37,440
Speaker 5:  lineup that just makes no sense and no one should buy it. Yeah,

1276
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:37,840
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1277
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,360
Speaker 9:  I You know in a vacuum, the SS nine plus is great. You know it's got a great

1278
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,840
Speaker 9:  screen, great performance, it's got all the benefits that the others have.

1279
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:48,680
Speaker 9:  It's just, it's too big to like comfortably use for tablet stuff.

1280
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:52,960
Speaker 9:  And then it's like if you are going to buy it for productivity,

1281
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:57,480
Speaker 9:  just buy the Ultra because that gives you the space to really be

1282
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,320
Speaker 9:  productive in a way that the Plus doesn't

1283
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,840
Speaker 3:  For for $200 more you can have the one that people go, whoa.

1284
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,640
Speaker 3:  Right. I mean that's like, that's this product. Like you look at an

1285
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,480
Speaker 3:  Sine Ultra, you're like, holy shit that that's a thing that exists.

1286
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:15,520
Speaker 3:  You look at the SS nine plus and you're like, well I'm gonna buy an iPad.

1287
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:20,000
Speaker 3:  Like that's that product. It's like this is the one that is the most head-on

1288
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Speaker 3:  with an iPad. The bezels are big. I would

1289
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,360
Speaker 9:  Say that the bezels are not that big.

1290
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,160
Speaker 3:  Oh, in this photo it looks like they're huge.

1291
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:29,640
Speaker 9:  Maybe they look that way. The photo huge You know what it is. It's because

1292
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:33,600
Speaker 9:  that photo is a photo of a video in 16 by nine. So it's making it

1293
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,840
Speaker 9:  look bigger. But if you look at the side, you can see the, the bezels on

1294
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,920
Speaker 9:  the side, they're, they're not that big.

1295
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:41,960
Speaker 4:  So if you watch anything, if you watch the vast majority of TV today,

1296
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,960
Speaker 4:  it'll look like it has huge bezels.

1297
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:48,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. 'cause it's great on an iPad. Four, three movies. That's my favorite.

1298
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:51,840
Speaker 3:  Okay. I'm, this is my defense of four three. Four, three is the god's chosen

1299
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,360
Speaker 3:  aspect ratio for portable computers. Our

1300
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,440
Speaker 5:  Thorn and savior four, three,

1301
01:12:56,780 --> 01:13:00,680
Speaker 3:  I'm saying 16, nine and 1610 screens are horrible. 1610 is the

1302
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:04,440
Speaker 3:  worst of all worlds. Right? Because you watch a movie, you still get the

1303
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,280
Speaker 3:  weird letter boxing and then you try to do any work and and or

1304
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:12,200
Speaker 3:  hold it God forbid in portrait. And you're like, well I'm just a

1305
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,840
Speaker 3:  guy with a rectangle. Everyone look at me

1306
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:20,120
Speaker 3:  and iPad like four three is like, you make one compromise on watching

1307
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:23,760
Speaker 3:  video, you make one compromise and everything else is great. Yeah.

1308
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,720
Speaker 3:  16, nine. You make one compromise, which is useful for, which is that it's

1309
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:29,760
Speaker 3:  useless for, for anything but watching video. Oh

1310
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:30,840
Speaker 5:  My god. The thing is enormous

1311
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,600
Speaker 3:  Dan. See that good sport,

1312
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:36,640
Speaker 9:  That's a thing. It's a platter. This is, this is the ultra So.

1313
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:40,840
Speaker 3:  We have not, we have not spent enough time in this show just

1314
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:44,720
Speaker 3:  we look, the audience has grown, we've added a second episode, we gotta do

1315
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:48,320
Speaker 3:  an entire episode. That's just like there's one correct aspect ratio. No,

1316
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:48,920
Speaker 3:  you're

1317
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:49,080
Speaker 9:  Wrong.

1318
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:52,920
Speaker 5:  The correct aspect ratio is three, two on laptops. That's it.

1319
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:56,920
Speaker 5:  There's no other good answer. Four three. You just said the only

1320
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,480
Speaker 5:  compromise with four three is watching video, which is the main thing most

1321
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,600
Speaker 5:  people do all the time.

1322
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:03,200
Speaker 9:  Like

1323
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:07,400
Speaker 5:  It's like, remember when Max were good except the keyboard sucked. Like it

1324
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,000
Speaker 5:  turns out keyboards are pretty important

1325
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:09,760
Speaker 3:  To

1326
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:13,600
Speaker 9:  Samsung's credit. These devices are phenomenal for watching video.

1327
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:17,720
Speaker 9:  Like the screens are tremendous, the sound is tremendous. Like these are

1328
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,040
Speaker 9:  entertainment machines. It's just personally, if I'm gonna spend

1329
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,560
Speaker 9:  $1,200 on a device, I'm gonna wanna do more than just watch a movie once

1330
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,440
Speaker 9:  a week or whatever on it. And so like I do wanna get more out of it.

1331
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:31,520
Speaker 4:  When do we get like a 2.39 aspect

1332
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:32,480
Speaker 4:  ratio on a pathway

1333
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:35,240
Speaker 3:  Like that to Toshiba laptop

1334
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,960
Speaker 9:  That had the 21 by nine screens.

1335
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,080
Speaker 3:  Right.

1336
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,960
Speaker 4:  I wanna feel like I'm watching a movie in the sixties on cama.

1337
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:42,320
Speaker 4:  Like I just wanted Wow.

1338
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:43,960
Speaker 3:  Christopher No was like, I made a

1339
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:49,320
Speaker 3:  laptops. You're not gonna believe how wide. It's,

1340
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:50,880
Speaker 4:  It's all I want.

1341
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:52,840
Speaker 3:  Alright, David, what's your, what's your pick?

1342
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:57,320
Speaker 5:  Mine's quick. It's, I've been following all this Google SS g e

1343
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:01,720
Speaker 5:  ai search stuff for a while and Google this week in

1344
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:05,320
Speaker 5:  the, in the guise of like relatively You know minor

1345
01:15:05,390 --> 01:15:09,360
Speaker 5:  feature update rolled out a thing where you can now use ss

1346
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,080
Speaker 5:  g e as you look at webpages and it will summarize them for you and you can

1347
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,720
Speaker 5:  like interact with webpages through Google's ai. And it's like,

1348
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:20,360
Speaker 5:  that's not a small thing. That's like an enormous leap in Google

1349
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:24,280
Speaker 5:  making Chrome like the AI hub of the

1350
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,080
Speaker 5:  internet, which is messy and weird and complicated and

1351
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:32,040
Speaker 5:  fascinating. And they're also putting more AI stuff in the

1352
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,840
Speaker 5:  sidebar of Chrome. So it's like very quietly AI is coming

1353
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,960
Speaker 5:  like front and center to the entire web browsing experience through Google.

1354
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:43,440
Speaker 5:  And like you talk about kind of AI all the way down, like we're

1355
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:47,360
Speaker 5:  gonna get to the point where Google's AI is summarizing AI generated

1356
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:51,360
Speaker 5:  webpages that you found through Google's AI powered search. And

1357
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:55,560
Speaker 5:  it's just all gonna get real, real, real weird. But Google

1358
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:59,480
Speaker 5:  like binging has been so loud about like we are putting Bing everywhere.

1359
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:02,640
Speaker 5:  Like Google is being very quiet about it, but it's basically doing the same

1360
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:02,920
Speaker 5:  thing.

1361
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:06,840
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The the, especially the sidebar stuff. The interesting thing about

1362
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,720
Speaker 3:  s G E right now is Google featured snippets are

1363
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,600
Speaker 3:  still often superior. Yeah. To s g e. Like

1364
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:18,520
Speaker 3:  the AI will like overwrite in a way like a precocious seventh grader and

1365
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,240
Speaker 3:  it's like, nah, I just need the answer to the question. Like Right. I don't

1366
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:22,960
Speaker 3:  need all this preamble.

1367
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,840
Speaker 5:  It can't answer a question. Like if, if a question has a simple answer, it's,

1368
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:30,800
Speaker 5:  it can help you like explore the universe of, of your question. But it

1369
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,600
Speaker 5:  can't just be like seven.

1370
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:34,680
Speaker 10:  It just can't do that.

1371
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:40,240
Speaker 3:  This thing though, this new SSG features where it's summarizing pages,

1372
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:43,960
Speaker 3:  there's something going on in the background. I dunno what it is. If you

1373
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,960
Speaker 3:  work with the New York Times, please tell me what it's, there's something

1374
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,880
Speaker 3:  going on with the New York Times and Google and OpenAI that I have not been

1375
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,400
Speaker 3:  able to to piece out. But if you look at New York Times' robot,

1376
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:56,800
Speaker 3:  T X T, it, it allows everything. It allows, Google allows OpenAI, it's, it

1377
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,480
Speaker 3:  literally it's star whatever I'll add. There's no

1378
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:04,360
Speaker 3:  very few things are blocked, which is fascinating. We got a actually a, a

1379
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:08,200
Speaker 3:  question from our reporter. When OpenAI rolled out its crawler that once

1380
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,960
Speaker 3:  you have a crawler you can can block it. So they just rolled it out and someone

1381
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,320
Speaker 3:  asked us, Hey, why do you block it? And the reason is actually contained

1382
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:18,120
Speaker 3:  in a piece David wrote about Neva, which is the internet

1383
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:21,400
Speaker 3:  has been so fixed for so long that most places

1384
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:25,960
Speaker 3:  only allowed Google and binging because binging powered all the other search

1385
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,880
Speaker 3:  engines for so long. So you only needed to allow Google and binging and

1386
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:33,560
Speaker 3:  everything else was just cost, right? Like a, an infinite amount of crawlers

1387
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:36,520
Speaker 3:  coming over your pages is just server costs. You don't need to pay because

1388
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:40,600
Speaker 3:  there's Google and there's binging. So most publishers, most

1389
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,800
Speaker 3:  pages only allow that. So OpenAI, now that they have a new crawler, they

1390
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,720
Speaker 3:  gotta go get permission from everyone. The Times allows everything. But

1391
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:51,040
Speaker 3:  then there was a report this week that they might sue OpenAI 'cause they're

1392
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,160
Speaker 3:  really mad at them and they want a deal and they have a deal with Google

1393
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:56,320
Speaker 3:  that no one knows the terms of, I'm telling you, there's this thing that

1394
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,800
Speaker 3:  is happening with AI on the web and all these features that are quietly rolling

1395
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:03,600
Speaker 3:  out in the background of it is like a nuclear

1396
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:07,520
Speaker 3:  explosion of lawsuits. It is just coming and it's, it's gonna

1397
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,440
Speaker 3:  be wild. And we're gonna talk about it at the code conference September 26th

1398
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,160
Speaker 3:  and 27th in California.

1399
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:17,080
Speaker 3:  I love it. It was good. I got there in the end. Actually my lightning round

1400
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,000
Speaker 3:  ones are all AI two ones

1401
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:23,160
Speaker 5:  You'll notice. Yeah. Neli said ones because unlike the rest of us, NELI is

1402
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,720
Speaker 5:  incapable of following the rules. Well

1403
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:29,440
Speaker 3:  It's two that are the same one, it's two that are the same thing.

1404
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:33,840
Speaker 3:  So OpenAI rolled out GPT four to do content moderation,

1405
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,920
Speaker 3:  which is terrifying. But

1406
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,080
Speaker 5:  Everybody treated this like it was a new thing. They were like, oh they're

1407
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:43,040
Speaker 5:  gonna have humans looking at the production of the algorithm and then

1408
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,600
Speaker 5:  they're gonna feed it back into the algorithm. She just did a story, what

1409
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,160
Speaker 5:  a novel concept and it's like that's how it has worked forever.

1410
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:52,080
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like Facebook and YouTube in particular

1411
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:56,280
Speaker 3:  have been like, this is a problem and maybe AI can solve. Like

1412
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:59,800
Speaker 3:  do you think Google has not been trying to do AI and content moderation YouTube

1413
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:03,560
Speaker 3:  for ages? Like they've been doing it that said, Casey

1414
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:07,680
Speaker 3:  asked a bunch of experts about it and platformer you go read it. That experts

1415
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:10,760
Speaker 3:  seem to really like this idea. They they think it is faster. They think they

1416
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,920
Speaker 3:  can build some tools. Importantly they think a bunch of startup social networks

1417
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,440
Speaker 3:  can use tools like this. You don't need the resources of a a a Microsoft,

1418
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:21,520
Speaker 3:  you don't need the resources of a meta or a Google or whatever. There's

1419
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,440
Speaker 3:  something there. Importantly if you go to Europe and all these other places,

1420
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:28,920
Speaker 3:  they have laws in the books now that say you have to be able to explain your

1421
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:32,760
Speaker 3:  content moderation decisions. And it's not clear if GPT four can do that.

1422
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:34,560
Speaker 3:  So it can't

1423
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,120
Speaker 4:  Let's

1424
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:37,560
Speaker 3:  They can't or they or they gotta build it. I mean

1425
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:39,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I was like it can't yet.

1426
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:41,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Part of what they said they're doing is part of the process is asking

1427
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:46,000
Speaker 5:  the model to explain itself. And as we've seen like the more recursive

1428
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,440
Speaker 5:  you get with these LLMs, the weirder and worse they all get. Yeah. But,

1429
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:52,600
Speaker 5:  but it's an interesting road to go down. And I think you're right. Like even

1430
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:56,520
Speaker 5:  if all this does is get everybody to like

1431
01:19:56,540 --> 01:20:00,280
Speaker 5:  you can plug and play c plus content moderation, like that's

1432
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,080
Speaker 5:  already a huge win for the internet. Are

1433
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:05,560
Speaker 4:  We gonna have a point where the content moderation, like where they ask the

1434
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:09,600
Speaker 4:  chat GPT to explain itself and, and we're gonna have to talk about how it

1435
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,680
Speaker 4:  just claimed that it was like a unicorn that longs for death.

1436
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:17,920
Speaker 3:  Like, I don't know, like I I I think we'll see, I mean the, the

1437
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,760
Speaker 3:  flip side of this, which right we're we're talking about putting a robot

1438
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,720
Speaker 3:  in a position to censor content is in Iowa school district. There are

1439
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:29,040
Speaker 3:  book bans across this country right now. This is a real problem.

1440
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:32,640
Speaker 3:  They decided they weren't gonna read the books. They were just gonna ask

1441
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:36,800
Speaker 3:  chat GPT to summarize all the books in the library and tell them which

1442
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,760
Speaker 3:  ones to ban, which is like a pure abdication

1443
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:44,680
Speaker 3:  of two D. Like that is the laziest shit I have ever heard in my

1444
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,520
Speaker 3:  entire life. If you are going to ban books don't, right?

1445
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:52,120
Speaker 3:  Like first, second like do do the work.

1446
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:57,000
Speaker 3:  Be like we, we asked a robot to tell us what books to ban. Like this

1447
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,240
Speaker 3:  is the, the beginning of the use of the tool beyond just

1448
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:04,800
Speaker 3:  the cool demos you see on TikTok. It's oh lazy people are

1449
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,320
Speaker 3:  gonna make stupid decisions with it. That impact like lots of things.

1450
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:12,240
Speaker 4:  This was, I mean this was also kind of a protest because they're being

1451
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,680
Speaker 4:  required. They have to go do it all themselves. Like they didn't, they weren't

1452
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:18,280
Speaker 4:  given a list of books. They were basically said you'll be like subject to

1453
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:22,160
Speaker 4:  big fines and stuff if you don't put together your list of

1454
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:25,960
Speaker 4:  books and have it done by a certain time. So that's why like they were like,

1455
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:29,360
Speaker 4:  okay, well we'll just do it fast and have chat GPT do it because you don't

1456
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:33,240
Speaker 4:  care about the kids so why should we? It was kind of like my read of of

1457
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,160
Speaker 4:  why they were doing it

1458
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,800
Speaker 3:  A a protest chat. ChatGPT, GPT banned. Still

1459
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,720
Speaker 4:  Not great, still like still books getting banned and kids don't have access

1460
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,080
Speaker 4:  to important media but like, well

1461
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,640
Speaker 3:  It got attention from us. So there's that. But I would say, this is the flip

1462
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,240
Speaker 3:  side of we, we want to be able to explain itself when you start making

1463
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,840
Speaker 3:  decisions like we'll let the robot summarize the book So, we can ban it from

1464
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,440
Speaker 3:  our library. You really need that robot to be able to explain

1465
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,720
Speaker 3:  itself. And so that's why I said it's two things that are kind of the same

1466
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:04,280
Speaker 3:  thing. Like we're gonna put it in charge of speech on the internet.

1467
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,800
Speaker 3:  It should really be able to explain itself because people, once you start

1468
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,320
Speaker 3:  saying this is an acceptable thing to do with it, people are gonna use it

1469
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:15,200
Speaker 3:  in truly bizarre ways. Last two things. We mentioned this

1470
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:18,840
Speaker 3:  briefly at the top of the show. The special council Jack Smith has obtained

1471
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:22,840
Speaker 3:  Trump's DMs from Twitter. We won't go into it except to say this is why

1472
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:26,640
Speaker 3:  we are constantly banging on about encryption and if this brings our two

1473
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:30,400
Speaker 3:  parties into alignment on the need for end-to-end encryption on our platforms,

1474
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:34,840
Speaker 3:  I'll take it. 'cause that's why you have it. Also your Twitter

1475
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:39,160
Speaker 3:  DMs have never been deleted. They just get hidden when you hit delete.

1476
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,520
Speaker 3:  Use encrypted platforms people and tell, use them. Don't

1477
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,120
Speaker 3:  DMM people on Twitter. All right, last one. Cranz. There's a Microsoft event

1478
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:47,920
Speaker 3:  in New York coming up.

1479
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:52,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah, September 21st. We're gonna get a Microsoft event.

1480
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:56,040
Speaker 4:  Sounds like we'll probably get some surfaces 'cause they frequently do one

1481
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:59,320
Speaker 4:  in like September, October. There's usually a big surface event. So it sounds

1482
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:03,080
Speaker 4:  like we'll get some of that. Who knows what else. Microsoft's been very busy

1483
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:06,560
Speaker 4:  this year so I wouldn't be surprised if we see other stuff. But who can say,

1484
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:11,240
Speaker 5:  I believe they're gonna talk about AI would be my guess. Yeah, just if I

1485
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:14,920
Speaker 5:  had to just kind of wildly stab in the dark, I think it's

1486
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,920
Speaker 5:  possible that the word co-pilot will be mentioned

1487
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:21,280
Speaker 3:  When you turn on the new surface. It's like, have you broken up with your

1488
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:21,760
Speaker 3:  wife yet?

1489
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:27,440
Speaker 3:  I'm here for you. Yeah. Speaking of Microsoft AI Code

1490
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:31,320
Speaker 3:  conference, September 26th, 27th. Microsoft CT O, Kevin Scott. Definitely

1491
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,160
Speaker 3:  gonna talk about AI.

1492
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:36,640
Speaker 5:  September by the way is going to be nuts. We

1493
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,920
Speaker 5:  assume there's gonna be an Apple event the second week of September. There's

1494
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,080
Speaker 5:  gonna be an Amazon event on the 20th. This is gonna be on the 21st.

1495
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:46,440
Speaker 5:  Code is then Meta Connect I believe is at the end of September. Like

1496
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:50,320
Speaker 5:  it's, it's gonna be full crazy coming back. Fun like for all The

1497
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,600
Speaker 5:  Vergecast listeners who are like, oh, talk about more gadgets. Oh, it's coming

1498
