Description: Nilay, David, and Alex talk about the new PlayStation 5 Pro — why it's so expensive, why it doesn't have a disc drive, and why it made so many people feel feelings. They also talk about the fallout from this week's iPhone launch, the first days of the Google ad trial, Kamala Harris's earrings, Huawei's triple-folding phone, and much more.

00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:51,755
Speaker 3:  Hello and welcome to Road Chest Flagship podcast of advanced ray tracing

3
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:55,115
Speaker 3:  the technology that everyone flas for every day. Kids going to school

4
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:58,875
Speaker 3:  screaming for advanced ray tracing. Taylor Swift, get outta here.

5
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:01,035
Speaker 3:  It's advanced ray tracing for

6
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:01,835
Speaker 4:  She also wants it.

7
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:05,635
Speaker 3:  She does. Yeah. Loudly and proudly at the VMAs. Yep.

8
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:06,475
Speaker 3:  Demanding.

9
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:07,715
Speaker 4:  That's all she talks

10
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:10,955
Speaker 3:  About. Hi. Even friend Eli. Alex Kranz is here in the studio. We're together.

11
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:11,795
Speaker 3:  Yes. This is

12
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:15,595
Speaker 4:  So exciting. And we're not CGI, even though the ray tracing looks like we

13
00:01:15,595 --> 00:01:15,715
Speaker 4:  are.

14
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:16,875
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Look at those reflections.

15
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,235
Speaker 4:  Oh my God. They're incredible, aren't

16
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:20,395
Speaker 3:  They? No one can stop them. David Pierce is here.

17
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:24,675
Speaker 5:  You know how Tom Cruise has like made his thing that he's the enemy

18
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:28,595
Speaker 5:  of motion smoothing. Taylor Swift should do this for Ray Tracing. Taylor,

19
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:30,235
Speaker 5:  if you're listening and I know that you are,

20
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:31,475
Speaker 3:  Please

21
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:34,875
Speaker 5:  Make a thing where you come on at the beginning of every video game and you

22
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:38,755
Speaker 5:  tell me how important it is to turn on Ray tracing. This is, this is

23
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:41,395
Speaker 5:  your moment to do real good in the United States of America.

24
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:44,675
Speaker 3:  Be like, pick visual fidelity over performance.

25
00:01:44,675 --> 00:01:46,555
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Post about that with your cat Taylor.

26
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:50,595
Speaker 3:  I will say, wow. I will say that in the, in the comments of our YouTube,

27
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:54,835
Speaker 3:  there's a sort of raging mini conspiracy theory about whether David

28
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:58,835
Speaker 3:  is actually in a living room or in front of a green screen. And I'm ne

29
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,915
Speaker 3:  we're never gonna tell. Never. We're never gonna tell. We're also never gonna

30
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:05,075
Speaker 3:  tell you how long the show's supposed to be. We're just gonna keep saying

31
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:08,155
Speaker 3:  we're going over and David is gonna keep clipping a little bit,

32
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,315
Speaker 3:  but not all the way. I don't think

33
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,595
Speaker 4:  I've ever seen David sit on that couch.

34
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:14,835
Speaker 3:  Yeah. No one's ever been back there. Yeah.

35
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:16,555
Speaker 5:  What Couch all Wait, what?

36
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:22,355
Speaker 3:  But once we get Ray tracing enabled on David, you'll never be able to tell

37
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,435
Speaker 3:  if he's screen

38
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,555
Speaker 5:  Screened or not gonna look so sick back there.

39
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:27,635
Speaker 3:  Full volumetric, static image of a living room.

40
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,995
Speaker 3:  We're gonna send millions of dollars to distinct

41
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:33,955
Speaker 4:  Movie. There's just so many like, oh my God, the sun hits it. The reflections.

42
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:37,955
Speaker 3:  If you're looking for more mediocre Star Wars shows, just wait until we enable

43
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,355
Speaker 3:  David's volumetric set.

44
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:43,875
Speaker 5:  Oh, there we go now. Okay, Liam. This just changed everything

45
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:48,715
Speaker 5:  now. Instead of having my one maybe real maybe static background, I

46
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:51,875
Speaker 5:  get to have a new one. Every single podcast. Yeah. We're doing this. I do.

47
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:55,555
Speaker 5:  I will say I have a, I think like eight foot

48
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:58,195
Speaker 5:  wide green screen underneath this couch

49
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,805
Speaker 3:  Over here. Now you've given it away. Well, I guess it's a second eight foot

50
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:02,165
Speaker 3:  wide green

51
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:05,045
Speaker 5:  Screen. This is Right. It's a, the green screen. Behind the green screen.

52
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:10,125
Speaker 5:  But there, the setup to make it work with my

53
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:14,365
Speaker 5:  computer was so complicated that we just gave up, which is why I don't

54
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:16,565
Speaker 5:  have a more interesting background, unfortunately. Yeah.

55
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:20,005
Speaker 3:  Well soon we'll get you the full volume and Sean Favre is gonna direct you

56
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:20,725
Speaker 3:  in a Be Quest

57
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:23,085
Speaker 5:  Deal. I'll wear the helmet. That's

58
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:24,325
Speaker 3:  How he directed the Lion King here.

59
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:25,845
Speaker 5:  I'm into it. I think

60
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:26,805
Speaker 3:  It might have been a rift actually.

61
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:29,205
Speaker 4:  I was like, he he wore a headset.

62
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:33,285
Speaker 3:  Yeah. 'cause he, when they made the Lion King, it's like all, it's all CGI.

63
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:37,245
Speaker 3:  So he directed it in a headset. I don't know exactly why he

64
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:40,045
Speaker 3:  was in headset, but there's a lot of photos of him in headset directing Line

65
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:42,605
Speaker 3:  King just sitting there. It's good. Okay. There's actually news talking about

66
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:45,885
Speaker 3:  including a legitimate ray tracing segue

67
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:50,105
Speaker 3:  to what is arguably the news of the week, which is the

68
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:50,985
Speaker 3:  PS five Pro,

69
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,465
Speaker 4:  Not, not the iPhone.

70
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:56,995
Speaker 3:  Well, the iPhone, I guess the iPhone happened this week. It did. This is

71
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:57,075
Speaker 3:  a

72
00:03:57,075 --> 00:04:00,875
Speaker 5:  Lot, if I'm being completely honest, based on just the

73
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:04,755
Speaker 5:  vibes on The Verge dot com, the PS five Pro might be bigger news than the

74
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:08,435
Speaker 5:  iPhone, which I think says something about the iPhone this year. But also

75
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:11,515
Speaker 5:  says a lot about how a lot of people feel about the particulars of the PS

76
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:12,235
Speaker 5:  five Pro. I just

77
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:14,515
Speaker 3:  Legitimately forgot that I was the iPhone matter

78
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:19,955
Speaker 3:  in my mind. We did a VERGE cast. The week ended. I I took a flight home.

79
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:23,315
Speaker 3:  It was a red eye. I took, I was asleep. I woke up in New York.

80
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:26,875
Speaker 3:  That's a new week everybody. Yep. Like start the calendar right over.

81
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,675
Speaker 3:  But you're, I think you're generally correct, David. Like, you know, in the

82
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:34,235
Speaker 3:  room it's, it is like very hard for me to tell. Yeah. 'cause it's just an

83
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:38,315
Speaker 3:  artificially hype environment. But out here in the world, even

84
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:41,155
Speaker 3:  other reporters I've talked to, interest is low.

85
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:43,675
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's not great.

86
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:47,835
Speaker 5:  Not only that, but it was so like disappointing

87
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:51,435
Speaker 5:  that I think the general Apple vibes are bad

88
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:55,355
Speaker 5:  because of it. Like a lot of people all over the internet and

89
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,035
Speaker 5:  some of them at this website that we work at called The Verge dot com,

90
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:02,835
Speaker 5:  who are generally people who like Apple and think stuff that Apple does is

91
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:06,635
Speaker 5:  cool, are like turning on the company. Like to, to the point where

92
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:09,635
Speaker 5:  it's like, is this an inflection point where Apple has lost the plot? Like

93
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:12,595
Speaker 5:  that's a thing you see over and over and over now. Yeah. It's wild.

94
00:05:13,035 --> 00:05:16,955
Speaker 3:  I would say, I saw John Gruber, who I saw at the event. He,

95
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:21,355
Speaker 3:  John lives it charmed lifestyle. He came to the event with Armed only with

96
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:22,515
Speaker 3:  a pen and a notebook.

97
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:23,915
Speaker 4:  I love that.

98
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:27,985
Speaker 3:  Incredible. I mean, I think he incredible had a phone on him, but he had

99
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:31,865
Speaker 3:  no laptop. But he tweeted afterwards, apple, Mrs. Steve Jobs like

100
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:35,105
Speaker 3:  everyone else. Or some variation of that sentence, which is a lot. That's

101
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:39,065
Speaker 3:  a big one. MG Siegler, who is also a friend, wrote an entire blog post

102
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:43,025
Speaker 3:  about Apple needs. An editor has too many products and I can't say no. And

103
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:44,425
Speaker 3:  hi, part of his thesis was

104
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:50,185
Speaker 3:  there too, stuck to the way Steve Jobs would've done things. And they

105
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:53,985
Speaker 3:  need to change for, they need to make more aggressive changes. His

106
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:57,725
Speaker 3:  example, of course, being the iPad. Yeah. Just let it run Mac os, which is

107
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:01,125
Speaker 3:  kind of like a hard diversion, you know, it's like extreme nerdery.

108
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:05,765
Speaker 3:  But you see that that vibe is out there, right. This, this is a company

109
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,205
Speaker 3:  that's no longer saying no. It is, it knows it's about to make more money

110
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:12,965
Speaker 3:  from services than the hardware. So it's just making all the hardware without

111
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,125
Speaker 3:  a point of view. I don't know, man. I think the thing that's weirdest for

112
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,805
Speaker 3:  me is they're gonna ship the phones without the

113
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:20,285
Speaker 3:  software.

114
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:21,925
Speaker 4:  It's sloppy feeling.

115
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,165
Speaker 3:  And it th there's just something about that, that they wouldn't have done

116
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:25,565
Speaker 3:  that before.

117
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:28,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well th they, it was only a couple of years ago where they did that

118
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,605
Speaker 4:  whole thing where they said, we are gonna slow down on all of our software.

119
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:35,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. 'cause we are going too fast and we're getting too sloppy. And then

120
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:39,085
Speaker 4:  to see them just kind of do it again, but even more

121
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:40,605
Speaker 4:  aggressively is surprising.

122
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,965
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So we'll see. And, and there's, you know, I think a big question that

123
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:47,965
Speaker 3:  I have in general is whether any of the AI stuff comes to anything. We're

124
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:49,925
Speaker 3:  gonna talk about some AI products later on the show. There's some interesting

125
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:53,445
Speaker 3:  ones that have come out. Some, some stuff is happening that is legitimately

126
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:57,885
Speaker 3:  interest raising. Whether it's gonna make all of the money that the AI industry

127
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:01,805
Speaker 3:  is currently spending, who knows? But Apple's in a rush to ship this

128
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:05,685
Speaker 3:  stuff. For what? I dunno. So, yeah. But I, I agree with you, David. Like

129
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:09,685
Speaker 3:  I, to my mind, the PS five pro is, it's generated more

130
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:13,885
Speaker 3:  interest because it is a more considered product. It has a

131
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:17,565
Speaker 3:  stronger point of view on what's gonna happen next. Whether you agree with

132
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:21,325
Speaker 3:  that point of view or not. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can disagree with, but

133
00:07:21,345 --> 00:07:24,885
Speaker 3:  it, it, it just, it's a, it's a stronger statement of like, whatever

134
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:28,885
Speaker 3:  might, whatever Sony thinks is next. Well, Microsoft is making the opposite

135
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:32,325
Speaker 3:  statement of like, maybe we should shut this down. Right. And like, there's

136
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:34,885
Speaker 3:  some turmoil happening in that industry and there's, there's like winners

137
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:38,565
Speaker 3:  and losers and it just seems, at least on the smartphone side, and we have

138
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:42,285
Speaker 3:  covered smartphones since the day The Verge started. Like our, we began

139
00:07:42,315 --> 00:07:46,005
Speaker 3:  this thing in 2011 because of smartphones. And it feels like

140
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:50,165
Speaker 3:  whatever wave that is has crested into it. Like a steady state, even though

141
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:55,445
Speaker 3:  like just over there are some of the most interesting smartphones that have

142
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:56,165
Speaker 3:  ever existed. Like

143
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:56,765
Speaker 4:  The trifold.

144
00:07:56,915 --> 00:08:00,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like the, the honor trifold got more co it was at the top of CNBC.

145
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:04,525
Speaker 3:  That's how I know things have like, broken out of Gadget world is like when

146
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:08,325
Speaker 3:  more mainstream outlets cover things in weird ways. Yeah. And so he looks

147
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:12,205
Speaker 3:  at the top of the CN BC website on Apple Day or the day after.

148
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:16,605
Speaker 3:  And it was like the normal stuff like rate cut. No. Yes. Who knows, like

149
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,525
Speaker 3:  on CN bbc. And then just in the middle of that was

150
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:22,765
Speaker 3:  $2,800 triple fold smartphone. And it was like,

151
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:27,005
Speaker 3:  that's the key word. Like a bunch of finance bros were like, hell

152
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:30,045
Speaker 3:  yeah. Like, I wanna spend $3,000 on an wanna

153
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:31,405
Speaker 4:  Smart. They watch the charts go up and down.

154
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:35,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean they, they can. And it's like, that is more interesting to people

155
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:38,885
Speaker 3:  than whatever is happening. It wasn't Apple announces iPhone 16, right? Yeah.

156
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,965
Speaker 3:  And there's something there. It's a gimmick. Who knows? Right. We'll

157
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:42,045
Speaker 4:  See.

158
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:46,325
Speaker 3:  But there's just something, something is up. Yeah.

159
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:49,285
Speaker 3:  We're going to, you know, we're gonna carry on with the coverage. Ideally

160
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:52,245
Speaker 3:  we'll review the phones. We'll have something to say about them. Like I said,

161
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:56,205
Speaker 3:  I'm still open to audience feedback on how to cover phones that are

162
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:59,605
Speaker 3:  launching without the core software that they're

163
00:08:59,685 --> 00:08:59,765
Speaker 4:  Supposed to

164
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:03,165
Speaker 5:  Finish. We've gotten a lot of that feedback, by the way. And I think it's,

165
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:07,085
Speaker 5:  it, it, it's interesting to me, and I would say the, the plurality of

166
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:10,365
Speaker 5:  the folks who've reached out to us agree with me that you in particular are

167
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:13,485
Speaker 5:  so hung up on this software that hasn't launched. Because I would say there

168
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:16,685
Speaker 5:  is very little indication that anything in that software is going to like

169
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:19,685
Speaker 5:  meaningfully change your life in any way. Like

170
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:25,285
Speaker 5:  this is, this is the, the I AI story right now is you have to tell

171
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:29,245
Speaker 5:  people you have an AI strategy and what cool products are there

172
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:32,445
Speaker 5:  that exist that are mattering to lots of people all the time. The

173
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:36,085
Speaker 4:  The thing is, you don't have to do that unless you do. You're totally

174
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:37,245
Speaker 4:  beholden. Unless

175
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:39,205
Speaker 5:  You're total, you get fired and your company goes outta business If. you

176
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:39,365
Speaker 5:  don't.

177
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:43,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You have to. You are so beholden to the stock market and you're so

178
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:46,725
Speaker 4:  beholden to your shareholders that you are not actually considering what

179
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:50,485
Speaker 4:  is a good product. And that, that, that feels like what we're butting

180
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:54,565
Speaker 4:  up against is people chasing the shareholders at the expense of the audience.

181
00:09:54,785 --> 00:09:57,805
Speaker 5:  Oh, I agree. I think it's the whole thing. And actually shipping is all downside.

182
00:09:58,155 --> 00:10:01,525
Speaker 5:  Like Yeah. When, when you put this stuff out in the world, that's when all

183
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:03,685
Speaker 5:  the bad stuff happens. It's, it's like it's

184
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:04,325
Speaker 4:  That's, we know the

185
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:06,885
Speaker 5:  Rabbit sucks Silicon Valley line, right? Like don't start making money because

186
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:09,725
Speaker 5:  then people start asking why you're not making more money. Like don't start

187
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:12,205
Speaker 5:  shipping AI because then everybody will ask why you're not shipping better

188
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:16,205
Speaker 5:  AI like this. Google has been through this 10 times over at this point.

189
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:19,885
Speaker 5:  Like it just keeps shipping stuff and it's broken and people freak out and

190
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,765
Speaker 5:  it's bad. And it is just nuking its core business in the name

191
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:27,445
Speaker 5:  of chasing AI stuff. And people are starting to wonder why. But If,

192
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:31,285
Speaker 5:  you don't tell investors that you have an AI strategy.

193
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:35,645
Speaker 5:  You won't have a job long enough to see any of it through. Yeah. Yeah. So

194
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:39,445
Speaker 5:  it's like, if, if I'm Apple, I, I think this is a total conspiracy

195
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:42,685
Speaker 5:  theory that is not actually what's going on. But like, it is an, it is not

196
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:45,805
Speaker 5:  a stupid idea to slow roll this as much as you can talk it up and don't ship

197
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:49,125
Speaker 5:  it is like a pretty solid save your ass strategy

198
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,205
Speaker 3:  Right now. But it's totally out of character for them. It's totally, totally

199
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:51,325
Speaker 3:  outta

200
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,205
Speaker 5:  Charact I'll say that I've been playing with, but AI has been out of character

201
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:57,085
Speaker 5:  for everybody. Like so many companies have not been themselves since

202
00:10:57,085 --> 00:10:57,965
Speaker 5:  chat GBT launched.

203
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,205
Speaker 3:  That's true. I will say I've been playing with a Pixel nine pro these past

204
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:05,095
Speaker 3:  few days and every time you pick up that

205
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:07,575
Speaker 3:  phone it's like, do you want me to do something for you? Have you met Gemini?

206
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:11,295
Speaker 3:  Here? I am. Would you like to add yourself to this photo? You're not in this

207
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,495
Speaker 3:  photo. Put yourself in the photo.

208
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,855
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And you're like, can you just turn off Bluetooth? And it's like, ah,

209
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:15,815
Speaker 5:  I can't, so sorry.

210
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:19,815
Speaker 3:  It's like, it it is like a, it is like a version of clippy from hell. You

211
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:23,655
Speaker 3:  know, it's like, do you want me to add some text to this email for some reason

212
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:27,815
Speaker 3:  I could. Yeah. Huh. Yeah. Why not? Why are we not? It's fine.

213
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:31,775
Speaker 3:  It's just a very, it's a weird time that said, we'll, we'll

214
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:35,215
Speaker 3:  we'll pick up the Apple stuff later. One thing to note,

215
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,015
Speaker 3:  I hear what you're saying, that it's weird that I'm focused on the softwares

216
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:42,495
Speaker 3:  in shipping 'cause I'm Mr. Review what's in the box. One thing that did get

217
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:46,335
Speaker 3:  announced just in the time between the event and today the

218
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:50,255
Speaker 3:  FDA actually did approve the hearing aid features for the AirPods too. That's

219
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:54,125
Speaker 3:  very cool. Which I continue to believe will be the biggest, the the most

220
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:58,005
Speaker 3:  impactful announcement of this event. Yes. So that, that did happen. We

221
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:00,365
Speaker 3:  assume it will ship later this fall now because they have the clearance.

222
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:04,685
Speaker 3:  That's a big deal. Yeah. But that's it. Like I don't, we're waiting on everything

223
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:08,605
Speaker 3:  else. Alright. Let's actually talk about PS five Pro. What, what is it

224
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:09,485
Speaker 3:  Alex? Yeah.

225
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:13,605
Speaker 4:  You know, have you ever like looked at a computer

226
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:17,005
Speaker 4:  and you're like, what if this computer was a little cheaper? Yeah.

227
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:21,765
Speaker 4:  It didn't do as much stuff. It played video games really, really

228
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:25,485
Speaker 4:  well. But it was also twice as much as another thing we have

229
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:29,405
Speaker 4:  that plays video games really, really well. Yeah. And, and, and

230
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:30,925
Speaker 4:  it just plays it a little better.

231
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:33,405
Speaker 3:  Is this just like a GPU upgrade for the PS?

232
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:37,485
Speaker 4:  It basically is, yeah. It's a GPU upgrade. You, it's got a much bigger GPU.

233
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:42,125
Speaker 4:  They are claiming much better ray tracing and also their version of

234
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:45,805
Speaker 4:  DLSS, which is an NVIDIA thing that like upscales so

235
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,845
Speaker 4:  much more intelligent ai.

236
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:50,165
Speaker 3:  But it's not actually DL DLSS.

237
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:52,125
Speaker 4:  It's not actually DLSS 'cause that's Nvidia,

238
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:54,325
Speaker 3:  It's just their a MD based riff on. Right.

239
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:58,325
Speaker 4:  Okay. They're a MD based, but not actually the a MD version. This is a

240
00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:02,285
Speaker 4:  Sony version Oh, good. Of the same thing. AI upscaling and,

241
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:05,645
Speaker 4:  and those are kind of the three big deals out of it. And, and the other big

242
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:09,525
Speaker 4:  part of it is that the price, it's $700. The normal one's

243
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:13,045
Speaker 4:  about four 50, and so it's not quite twice, but

244
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:16,365
Speaker 4:  it's expensive. Yeah. And it's, it's also got,

245
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:19,925
Speaker 4:  you know, no dis disk drive and people are having a lot of feelings about

246
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:20,885
Speaker 4:  the disk drive. Well

247
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:22,725
Speaker 3:  You can get an accessory one, right. You can get

248
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:25,485
Speaker 4:  An accessory one. But it's kind of like, remember when they took the disc

249
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:28,965
Speaker 4:  drive out of the, the, the MacBook and everybody lost their mind?

250
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,605
Speaker 4:  It's the same thing. It's like physical media. I love physical media. It

251
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,525
Speaker 4:  feels like physical media has been like on an uptick. And now it's like,

252
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:40,205
Speaker 4:  oh, so I've just done $700 for this and then another $80

253
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,025
Speaker 4:  for the disc drive. What

254
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:46,305
Speaker 5:  This feels like to me is as if Apple

255
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:50,945
Speaker 5:  revved the Mac Pro and was like, this thing is sick

256
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:54,985
Speaker 5:  fastest ever, everything is amazing. You're gonna love it. It has

257
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:58,985
Speaker 5:  one USBC port. Yeah. That's it. Enjoy. Like,

258
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:02,425
Speaker 5:  it, it, it doesn't make any sense to me that you would make your highest

259
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:05,905
Speaker 5:  and most impressive looking thing, which

260
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:10,185
Speaker 5:  has a Venn diagram of users that I would say overlaps fairly aggressively

261
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:13,945
Speaker 5:  with the section of users who care about things like physical media and

262
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:17,745
Speaker 5:  having a collection of discs and cares about the, the liner

263
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:21,465
Speaker 5:  notes and all that stuff. Like those two people are the same person. And

264
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:25,545
Speaker 5:  so the idea that you're gonna be like, we're gonna give you all

265
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:29,105
Speaker 5:  the power in the world, but no, physical media

266
00:14:29,365 --> 00:14:32,945
Speaker 5:  is just so strange to me. Even if it were gonna make this thing more expensive,

267
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:36,705
Speaker 5:  if it was $800 and had a disc drive, I would understand it way more than

268
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,985
Speaker 5:  I understand $700 at no disc drive. But you

269
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:41,625
Speaker 3:  Can spend $780 and get the discount

270
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:41,945
Speaker 5:  You can.

271
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,825
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But I, I think it's, it's the fact that it's called the pro. It is

272
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:49,545
Speaker 4:  so much more expensive and then it doesn't have a disk drive it. So,

273
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:53,005
Speaker 4:  so that, that's where people are getting concerned. But at the same time,

274
00:14:53,665 --> 00:14:56,125
Speaker 4:  as we talked about earlier, this is, this is where they're heading. Right.

275
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,645
Speaker 4:  Like they've been heading this way for a long time. They don't want you to

276
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:02,245
Speaker 4:  have a desk drive. Yeah. They don't want you to using the desks. They, they

277
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:02,485
Speaker 4:  want you,

278
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,445
Speaker 3:  They certainly do not want used games to exist. Yeah.

279
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:08,205
Speaker 4:  They want you buying the thing on their store and then when it doesn't work,

280
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:12,445
Speaker 4:  going and buying the new upgrade on their store over and over and over again.

281
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:16,205
Speaker 4:  They're very happy with that. And, and most of the developers and stuff seem

282
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:19,765
Speaker 4:  pretty fine with that. It's just the, the real

283
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:23,365
Speaker 4:  hardcore fans. But the hardcore fans so far are really excited about this

284
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:23,525
Speaker 4:  thing.

285
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:28,085
Speaker 3:  Wait, I'm, I like, I like Best drive. I like

286
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:31,485
Speaker 3:  physical media. I like owning software. Yeah. I think my prerequisites on

287
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:34,685
Speaker 3:  this are, you know, my quiet is there. You've

288
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:35,245
Speaker 4:  Talked about it a bit. Yeah.

289
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:38,845
Speaker 3:  You know, I, I, I feel, so let me just make the argument here. Yeah.

290
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,845
Speaker 3:  The PS five in particular from inception has been all about

291
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:47,205
Speaker 3:  wicked fast SSD speeds. Yes. So you were never playing the

292
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:51,165
Speaker 3:  game off the optical disc. You were always copying it to the Yep. SST So

293
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:55,085
Speaker 3:  the, the disc is like a totem. Yes. Right? It's

294
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:56,525
Speaker 3:  you're always downloading the game.

295
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:59,485
Speaker 4:  You're holding it and you're like, yeah, I can do this. Theoretically you

296
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:03,445
Speaker 4:  can play parts of the game off of the disc, but for the most part it's, it's

297
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:05,085
Speaker 4:  downloading it on versus

298
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:08,885
Speaker 3:  Well you're definitely, you're definitely at least copying a enormous chunks

299
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:09,645
Speaker 3:  of the game for this.

300
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:12,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And then you have to do your day zero updates and all of that stuff.

301
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:17,005
Speaker 3:  So what I'm just like If you, like I am a person with a vinyl collection.

302
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:20,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And you, you know, it's like, I like to put on a record and then like

303
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:24,445
Speaker 3:  shake my fist at the man because they can't, the internet has

304
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:26,245
Speaker 3:  nothing to do with listening to music in that case. I,

305
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,205
Speaker 4:  I think the concern here is that now you can't, like If, you wanna play a

306
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:32,085
Speaker 4:  PS four game or something. If, you wanna play an older game. Sure. You can't

307
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:34,845
Speaker 4:  use, you know, you have to pay extra for that If, you wanna watch a movie,

308
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:38,725
Speaker 4:  which, like the PS five has historically been a very good Blu-ray player.

309
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:42,965
Speaker 4:  You have to now pay extra for that. And it's got that pro moniker.

310
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:43,925
Speaker 4:  So you're like, okay,

311
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:46,125
Speaker 3:  I see what you're saying. It is just like value for doll.

312
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It, yeah, it's just like, it's, it's just a, it's a squirrely, squirrely

313
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:51,405
Speaker 4:  space, but like the PS five Pro is really cool,

314
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:56,135
Speaker 4:  but I'm one, I'm like a graphics nerd, so I'm like, yeah, this is sick. But

315
00:16:56,135 --> 00:16:59,855
Speaker 4:  also I don't need to spend $700 on this thing. I've got a PS five

316
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:01,535
Speaker 4:  Yeah. With a disc drive. It rules.

317
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,855
Speaker 3:  I play games in it. The thing that actually gets me is right next to

318
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:09,695
Speaker 3:  this they released Astro Bott, which is like Game of the Year Contender.

319
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,335
Speaker 3:  Yes. I've been playing Astros playroom with Max. We are like gonna, we bought

320
00:17:13,335 --> 00:17:17,215
Speaker 3:  the controller, which is adorable. We're gonna play Astro Bott

321
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,295
Speaker 3:  whenever she tires of Astros playroom. The thing about a 6-year-old is like,

322
00:17:20,295 --> 00:17:21,735
Speaker 3:  yeah, just keep playing this game. Yeah.

323
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:23,895
Speaker 4:  It's just the first five minutes over and over and over

324
00:17:23,895 --> 00:17:26,415
Speaker 3:  Again. You're you're good. Actually, we don't need to introduce new ideas

325
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:30,415
Speaker 3:  or spend money, but like, from what I can tell Astro Bot is

326
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:34,415
Speaker 3:  the reason to buy a PS five. Yeah. And it is not the reason to buy a

327
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:37,495
Speaker 3:  PS five Pro. It just feels, those things feel disconnected to me in a way

328
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:39,015
Speaker 3:  that seems ridiculous. Yeah.

329
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:42,415
Speaker 4:  'cause the Astro Bott is focusing in kind of like the Nintendo play style

330
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:45,895
Speaker 4:  of, of Nintendo is all about, it doesn't care about the graphics as much.

331
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:49,805
Speaker 4:  It cares about how the game plays. Whereas PlayStation and Xbox have historically

332
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:52,125
Speaker 4:  been like, we care about how the game plays, but also we want it to look

333
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,405
Speaker 4:  fucking sick. Yeah. And, and in this case they're like,

334
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:59,805
Speaker 4:  nah. Like we've got this one side where we had this asbo and you can use

335
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:02,485
Speaker 4:  the controller in all these really incredible ways. Feels like a switch.

336
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:05,525
Speaker 4:  It feels just new and dynamic and fun. And then

337
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,365
Speaker 4:  we got this like

338
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:08,445
Speaker 3:  Other thing.

339
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:11,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This thing. So you can go play Grant Ismo.

340
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:14,405
Speaker 3:  What's the best, that's really cool. The, what's the best argument for the

341
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:15,045
Speaker 3:  PS five Pro?

342
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:17,085
Speaker 4:  Do you really like Spider-Man two?

343
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:21,205
Speaker 3:  I mean, that's always, that's like the core argument for the PlayStation.

344
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:21,565
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

345
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:22,325
Speaker 4:  Like

346
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:24,325
Speaker 3:  The PlayStation two is literally had the Spider-Man font on it.

347
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:30,485
Speaker 4:  It really is like, like the, the core argument is, do you really like

348
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:34,685
Speaker 4:  the last of us in SPI and Spider-Man and, and some of these

349
00:18:34,685 --> 00:18:38,125
Speaker 4:  other games that have actually implemented ray tracing and do you really

350
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,965
Speaker 4:  want to, like, you really, really like that? And if so, go get this

351
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:44,765
Speaker 4:  because it's gonna look a little sharper. It's gonna look a little cleaner.

352
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:48,885
Speaker 4:  I think If, you are playing on a con or if you're playing your console on

353
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:50,805
Speaker 4:  a monitor, it makes sense.

354
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:51,365
Speaker 3:  Sure.

355
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:55,605
Speaker 4:  If you're playing it on a big TV in like a huge sunlit room,

356
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,885
Speaker 4:  don't do this. Like, that's just a waste of money. You will not be able to

357
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:01,755
Speaker 4:  appreciate a single bit of this. I

358
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:05,555
Speaker 5:  I will say, I think the, the most compelling argument of this, and I think

359
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:09,995
Speaker 5:  is his name, mark Cerney, the lead architect. Okay. I can never remember

360
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:12,635
Speaker 5:  if it's Matt or Mark. It's like the same. It's, it's two different people

361
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:16,435
Speaker 5:  in my head. But anyway, it's, mark said basically that

362
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,275
Speaker 5:  the thing that they've seen is that everybody is forever making trade offs

363
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:23,235
Speaker 5:  between performance and fidelity. Right. So like, do I want

364
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:26,675
Speaker 5:  it to look good or do I want lots of frames? And and that is, that is like

365
00:19:26,675 --> 00:19:30,515
Speaker 5:  kind of the gaming performance trade off. And with the PS five pro, you

366
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:32,635
Speaker 5:  don't have to make that trade off. Right? Yeah. Like you can have very high

367
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:36,035
Speaker 5:  settings at very high frame rates. That's not a thing that

368
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:40,275
Speaker 5:  most people will notice, but it is the kind of thing

369
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:44,355
Speaker 5:  that matters, right? Like it's, I I I, I see that as the same argument

370
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:48,355
Speaker 5:  for like why the two of you spent six times as much money on your

371
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,995
Speaker 5:  televisions as I did. It's, it's, it's not for everybody

372
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:52,915
Speaker 3:  Because my eyes work, David.

373
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:57,195
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Then, then why not spend $700 on this? And

374
00:19:57,195 --> 00:20:01,115
Speaker 3:  I happily said it to Fidelity mode and I let it drop

375
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:04,475
Speaker 3:  frames while I try to fi figure out the new kicking indicator from Adam every

376
00:20:04,475 --> 00:20:06,995
Speaker 3:  year. It's, it's fine. It's impossible to use.

377
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:10,835
Speaker 5:  I think to your Astro Bott point, I think the, the thing that is odd to me

378
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,435
Speaker 5:  about this launch is that there isn't one sort of

379
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:17,155
Speaker 5:  great example, right? There's a bunch of games. They've actually, I think

380
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:20,675
Speaker 5:  upgraded a lot of games. There are a lot of things that will look slightly

381
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:24,475
Speaker 5:  better. But this is the sort of thing that I think works when you can come

382
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:27,835
Speaker 5:  out with like a, a sort of next

383
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:30,315
Speaker 5:  generation looking game. Well,

384
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:34,035
Speaker 4:  And I think that's increasingly hard to do. We've seen this since Oh, for

385
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:37,475
Speaker 4:  sure. Since like the PS three of saying, oh, I think we're kind of hitting

386
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:41,035
Speaker 4:  our limit on how we can make, how good we can make these games look. And

387
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:44,795
Speaker 4:  the difference between a PS four and a PS five game. I'm so sorry to a lot

388
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:47,485
Speaker 4:  of people out there who are gonna be really upset with me right now isn't

389
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:51,725
Speaker 4:  actually that different. Like Yeah. I will notice it, Neil, I will notice

390
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:55,165
Speaker 4:  it. A a few, a small group of fans are really gonna notice those differences.

391
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,245
Speaker 4:  The majority of people are just gonna be like, yeah, that's the game. Yeah.

392
00:20:58,245 --> 00:21:00,885
Speaker 4:  Sometimes it's a little blurry, sometimes it's not. And, and, and the majority

393
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,805
Speaker 4:  of people don't care about that. And they're really trying to push this idea.

394
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:07,565
Speaker 4:  They, they, they said, oh, a lot more people are choosing

395
00:21:07,585 --> 00:21:10,925
Speaker 4:  the performance mode over the Fidelity mode. We wanted to give them the give,

396
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:13,685
Speaker 4:  make them not have to choose. That's why we did this.

397
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:18,715
Speaker 4:  How many people like, I don't think it's the majority of people,

398
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:22,435
Speaker 5:  But that's fine, right? This isn't supposed to be for everybody. Yeah.

399
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:24,875
Speaker 3:  It's for professionals. Yeah.

400
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:27,755
Speaker 4:  But it's for professional who is the professional.

401
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,835
Speaker 5:  This is just for Ninja. That's the only

402
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:31,075
Speaker 3:  Way.

403
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:35,915
Speaker 4:  But it's not like there's any pro features here. The pro feature is we put

404
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:39,755
Speaker 4:  a bigger GPU in because we could fit a bigger GPU in. And one of the criticisms

405
00:21:39,755 --> 00:21:42,955
Speaker 4:  of the original PS five was that it was, it, and the Xbox were underpowered

406
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:46,675
Speaker 4:  as soon as they arrived because they were based on current, that current

407
00:21:46,775 --> 00:21:50,355
Speaker 4:  Gen A MD technology. And so it's like they've always been a little

408
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:54,315
Speaker 4:  behind the times, but the exchanges that the games just play.

409
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:58,435
Speaker 4:  And so now that PlayStation is putting all these options in and making you

410
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:01,715
Speaker 4:  think about these things, you're starting to think of it less like a

411
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,195
Speaker 4:  console where just you plug it in and go and you're starting to think of

412
00:22:05,195 --> 00:22:08,995
Speaker 4:  it more like a pc. And I think that's a dangerous place for

413
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:13,165
Speaker 4:  Sony to be historically the famous PC

414
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,285
Speaker 4:  pro successful PC program over there. Yeah. They really know how to do it.

415
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,725
Speaker 4:  But like, like it works for Microsoft, it makes sense for Microsoft. Microsoft's

416
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:23,245
Speaker 4:  doing the exact same thing. Both of these companies are pushing these things

417
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:26,765
Speaker 4:  towards PCs. They fundamentally are, they're all the technology in them,

418
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:30,525
Speaker 4:  or PC technology. They're based on AMD's technology.

419
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:33,285
Speaker 4:  Nintendo's over on the other side saying, what if we just did cool shit?

420
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:34,765
Speaker 3:  What if we made good games? Yeah.

421
00:22:34,765 --> 00:22:38,045
Speaker 4:  What if we just make good games? And it's, it's a weird place that, that

422
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:42,045
Speaker 4:  Sony's taking this. And I don't know if, so like, it makes sense

423
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:44,525
Speaker 4:  for Xbox. It doesn't make as much sense for Sony.

424
00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:46,165
Speaker 3:  I will, I will point out that

425
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:51,635
Speaker 3:  the $80 disc drive is sold out on Amazon and Best Buy

426
00:22:51,695 --> 00:22:52,115
Speaker 3:  and Target.

427
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:55,585
Speaker 5:  So this is the Venn diagram. Like truthfully, it

428
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:59,505
Speaker 4:  Also works for the PS five slim. So, you know, there's a lot of slim

429
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:01,145
Speaker 4:  owners out there, I'm

430
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:01,985
Speaker 3:  Sure. But this

431
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:05,185
Speaker 5:  Is what kills me. The slim not having a disc drive. I completely understand.

432
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:08,945
Speaker 5:  Yes. That makes perfect sense. Having it be cheaper

433
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:12,585
Speaker 5:  and smaller and for people whose games are digital, which is most people

434
00:23:12,715 --> 00:23:16,625
Speaker 5:  makes absolute perfect sense to me. This just

435
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:20,545
Speaker 5:  doesn't like, and, and in this, in this one tiny

436
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:23,505
Speaker 5:  lane, you have a group of people who will put up with a bigger console who

437
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:27,305
Speaker 5:  are likely to pay more for it, who are willing to make all the sacrifices

438
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:31,425
Speaker 5:  required to get the very best possible everything out of it. Right? Like

439
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:34,625
Speaker 5:  the only reason to buy this is If. you want like the 10 out of 10

440
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:36,505
Speaker 5:  experience? Yeah.

441
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:40,665
Speaker 1:  Let me get in here with my hot take. Okay, let's go Liam. Y'all ready?

442
00:23:40,665 --> 00:23:44,465
Speaker 1:  Yeah, we're ready. The problem with the PS five Pro is not that it's

443
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:48,245
Speaker 1:  too expensive, it's that it's not expensive enough. They

444
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:52,165
Speaker 1:  should have released a 9 99 version of this thing. Not a

445
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:55,965
Speaker 1:  $700. It should actually be a PC that you can

446
00:23:56,355 --> 00:24:00,045
Speaker 1:  hook up to your TV and have the like, lovely experience of

447
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:04,325
Speaker 1:  just, it always working for your game. You just turn it on and

448
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:08,245
Speaker 1:  start playing your game. But with the graphics that

449
00:24:08,265 --> 00:24:11,765
Speaker 1:  people are buying their PC games for. Yeah. Sony knows

450
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:15,885
Speaker 1:  that there are a lot of people out there that care about having the best

451
00:24:16,405 --> 00:24:20,125
Speaker 1:  possible version of their games and they'll play them on pc. I think they've

452
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:24,085
Speaker 1:  proven that they could sell a 9 99 PS five to

453
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:26,685
Speaker 1:  the extreme end of the market. The enthusiasts.

454
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:29,685
Speaker 3:  I like that. You, you've just pitched a home theater pc. I was, everything

455
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:29,805
Speaker 3:  comes

456
00:24:29,825 --> 00:24:32,085
Speaker 5:  All the way around. Just like somebody at Microsoft is hearing this going,

457
00:24:32,085 --> 00:24:33,445
Speaker 5:  oh God. Oh God. Oh God. We're

458
00:24:33,445 --> 00:24:34,725
Speaker 3:  We're gonna do it again. We're

459
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:36,085
Speaker 1:  Just too soon. They were just too soon.

460
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:37,405
Speaker 4:  They're too soon. No, I,

461
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:39,965
Speaker 5:  I too Liam's point, I do think the idea of

462
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:44,525
Speaker 5:  play PC games but don't have to deal with Windows would be compelling to

463
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:48,165
Speaker 5:  a surprisingly large number of people. Which I think is also what Microsoft

464
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:50,365
Speaker 5:  thinks and can't figure out what to do

465
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:53,805
Speaker 4:  With. It's, it's trying, it's trying. Like, I mean, I I think the next Xbox

466
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,085
Speaker 4:  not, not the next gen

467
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:57,365
Speaker 3:  Isn't you just describe the steam deck.

468
00:24:57,715 --> 00:24:58,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

469
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:02,525
Speaker 3:  Right? I mean, isn't that the, like you're on a plane, you can play PC games

470
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:04,165
Speaker 3:  and doesn't run Windows. The battery life is

471
00:25:04,165 --> 00:25:07,485
Speaker 5:  Good. Yeah. But the, the Steam deck runs a, runs a like

472
00:25:07,495 --> 00:25:10,005
Speaker 5:  smartphone chip on a tiny screen. Yeah. It's

473
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:12,485
Speaker 4:  Like a potato compared to the PS five graphics

474
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:15,605
Speaker 3:  Wise. All right. Here, here's my poll for The Vergecast audience.

475
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:20,085
Speaker 3:  But let's assume you own a, a PS five. What would you rather spend money

476
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,985
Speaker 3:  on a Steam deck or a PS five Pro? You know, us. I'm very, I

477
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:28,025
Speaker 3:  I I feel like just based on this conversation, that's more of a choice

478
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:29,625
Speaker 3:  than we are, right?

479
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:33,105
Speaker 5:  No, I I think that's the wrong question. I I don't think this is like every

480
00:25:33,175 --> 00:25:36,385
Speaker 5:  year when people are like, should you upgrade from the iPhone 15 to the 16?

481
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:39,945
Speaker 5:  Like the answer's no. And no one is doing that. The answer is If. you have

482
00:25:39,985 --> 00:25:43,625
Speaker 5:  a PS four or a PS four Pro. Like to me the

483
00:25:43,785 --> 00:25:46,825
Speaker 5:  interesting upgrade path is If. you have a PS four Pro and you've been sitting

484
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:49,865
Speaker 5:  around waiting for the PS five Pro to buy one. Is this the thing you were

485
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:53,545
Speaker 5:  waiting for If, you have a PS five. I I would, I would bet the number of

486
00:25:53,545 --> 00:25:56,305
Speaker 5:  people who were like, oh, throw my PS five in the trash. I'm buying a PS

487
00:25:56,305 --> 00:26:00,185
Speaker 5:  five pro to get slightly better. Ray tracing is like vanishingly

488
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,945
Speaker 5:  small, but I don't think that's who Sony is going for

489
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:05,385
Speaker 4:  Here. But I also think the PS four Pro people, I was one of those people.

490
00:26:05,505 --> 00:26:06,945
Speaker 4:  I had a PS four pro. I really liked it.

491
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,065
Speaker 5:  I have one right here. Yeah,

492
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:12,145
Speaker 4:  It's great. Got a PS five because it was new and I wanted to play all the

493
00:26:12,145 --> 00:26:16,105
Speaker 4:  new games. If you're on a PS four pro, you're now having to pay twice

494
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:19,865
Speaker 4:  the amount, like the PS five, the PS four Pro wasn't

495
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:22,225
Speaker 4:  this high a markup between it and the regular PS

496
00:26:22,225 --> 00:26:24,705
Speaker 5:  Four. Didn't it also come out like right after the PS four?

497
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:27,665
Speaker 4:  No, it took, it, it it took a while. It a couple years. Yeah. It was a couple

498
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:30,865
Speaker 4:  years and it was a big upgrade. 'cause you were doing 4K you were doing like

499
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:34,185
Speaker 4:  a lot of big stuff in it. Whereas this one is just like

500
00:26:35,035 --> 00:26:37,065
Speaker 4:  we've do you know what DLSS is?

501
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:40,105
Speaker 3:  We made our own weird version of it.

502
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:44,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And like that's a lot harder to sell to the, nor like the, the normal

503
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:47,565
Speaker 4:  folks. I say because we're all big nerds here. We love having a

504
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,405
Speaker 3:  Good planet. Look, I watch these comparison videos. I waited for Digital

505
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:53,765
Speaker 3:  Foundry to do its thing. Yeah. And I was still like, yeah, I don't, I'm good.

506
00:26:53,765 --> 00:26:56,165
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like I'm horrible at Madden and I play Astro Bott.

507
00:26:56,305 --> 00:26:59,645
Speaker 4:  The whole meme right now is people watching it and like pausing it and taking

508
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:03,165
Speaker 4:  their glasses off and on. Trying to see where the differences are between

509
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:07,085
Speaker 4:  the two, the two versions. 'cause it, it's really small and Yeah, it's

510
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:10,445
Speaker 4:  noticeable, but it's really small. Yeah. And most people don't care that

511
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:11,725
Speaker 4:  much. They just wanna play the game. I

512
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:15,445
Speaker 3:  Will issue my almost weekly reminder that you cannot evaluate the quality

513
00:27:15,445 --> 00:27:18,045
Speaker 3:  of anything on your smartphone screen. Yeah. You just can't,

514
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:23,165
Speaker 3:  you can't look at stuff on a smartphone screen. Just like when people try

515
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:25,925
Speaker 3:  to, we do it all the time when we're like, listen to these speakers and we

516
00:27:25,925 --> 00:27:28,765
Speaker 3:  like play, we record them and then people watch them on YouTube, on their

517
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:31,325
Speaker 3:  smartphone speakers. I don't know what's happening there. That's

518
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:31,725
Speaker 5:  Nothing. Yeah.

519
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:35,285
Speaker 3:  That's just like a handshake agreement through the internet to like, we're

520
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:38,285
Speaker 3:  gonna feel some vibes. Yeah. That's not right. Just

521
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:39,485
Speaker 4:  Believe us. We're telling the truth.

522
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:43,525
Speaker 3:  That's how I feel about those VSI videos. I dunno, I am very interested in

523
00:27:43,525 --> 00:27:46,405
Speaker 3:  what is happening in the broader gaming market. 'cause it feels like that

524
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:47,005
Speaker 3:  shakeup,

525
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:52,005
Speaker 4:  This split is like really happening, right? Like, like we knew this

526
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:55,525
Speaker 4:  PC moment was happening for consoles, but this in particular,

527
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:59,365
Speaker 4:  like it was, it was, it was a moment with PS four Pro. 'cause you were like,

528
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:02,805
Speaker 4:  okay, now we are fracturing the console market in a way the console market

529
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:06,085
Speaker 4:  typically isn't fractured. The whole point of the console market is no fracture.

530
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:10,165
Speaker 4:  Like everything is, you go, you buy this thing, it does the games and now

531
00:28:10,165 --> 00:28:13,445
Speaker 4:  you're getting all these different skews sort of like Apple just introducing

532
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:15,805
Speaker 4:  all these different SKUs and like, yeah, okay, you're gonna meet more of

533
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:19,445
Speaker 4:  the market here, but you also lose why people like this product to begin

534
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:20,525
Speaker 4:  with, which is simplicity.

535
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:25,125
Speaker 5:  I wonder if what we're seeing is just this like incredible

536
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:28,725
Speaker 5:  bifurcation of the gaming industry where on the one hand you have the, the

537
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:31,805
Speaker 5:  handheld revolution, right? Which is like, I think is going to eat the low

538
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:35,165
Speaker 5:  end consoles alive. It's already happening. Right? Like if I

539
00:28:35,515 --> 00:28:39,405
Speaker 5:  just want to play Astro bot, the idea of me needing a

540
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:42,405
Speaker 5:  gigantic box to do it, I think is like, that's ending very quickly.

541
00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:48,165
Speaker 5:  Then the flip side is the high end stuff is going to get higher end. So it

542
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:51,765
Speaker 5:  feels like we're we're gonna end up in a place of like music streaming and

543
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:54,325
Speaker 5:  vinyl and nothing in between. Right? Yeah. You're either gonna have this

544
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:57,845
Speaker 5:  sort of like beautiful bespoke setup with a lot of

545
00:28:58,435 --> 00:29:02,085
Speaker 5:  very specific things, but it is going to be extremely high fidelity and wonderful.

546
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:06,165
Speaker 5:  Or we're going to lean deep into convenience and streaming and

547
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:08,925
Speaker 5:  everything is gonna be lower quality. But that's what people want. Well

548
00:29:08,925 --> 00:29:12,245
Speaker 4:  I think the, the, the the, there's a third prong here that kind of affects

549
00:29:12,245 --> 00:29:15,405
Speaker 4:  it, which is that they own so many of these studios that they're, that are

550
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:18,845
Speaker 4:  making these games and these studios aren't making games for anybody else.

551
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:22,685
Speaker 4:  Right? Like Astro bot. You can't go play that on anything but a

552
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:26,405
Speaker 4:  Sony device. 'cause Sony wants to keep you in their wheelhouse and that's,

553
00:29:27,385 --> 00:29:31,285
Speaker 4:  Ooh, the FTC, it's gonna have feelings. If you get, I think If

554
00:29:31,285 --> 00:29:34,045
Speaker 4:  you get, if you're like, look, we're basically PCs, we're doing all of this

555
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:37,205
Speaker 4:  stuff also you can't play last of us on anything else. People will start

556
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:40,965
Speaker 4:  having feelings about that in a very real, real way that I'm kind of curious

557
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:41,325
Speaker 4:  about.

558
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:45,165
Speaker 3:  Well, I think Sony's allowed to have its first party studios, which has been

559
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:48,845
Speaker 3:  whittling down. It's when Microsoft bought Activision and said, we're gonna

560
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:51,845
Speaker 3:  close off Call of Duty that you've got all the regulators. I would point

561
00:29:51,845 --> 00:29:55,605
Speaker 3:  out that ever since Microsoft actually closed that Activision deal, it has

562
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:59,005
Speaker 3:  just been clown cars, cities over there just

563
00:29:59,155 --> 00:30:03,085
Speaker 3:  banging into walls and falling off cliffs. It's great. They announced

564
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:06,805
Speaker 3:  just today that they're gonna lay off 650 more Xbox employees. That's sucks.

565
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:10,685
Speaker 3:  This is just a wave of layoffs and strategy shifts all after

566
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:13,645
Speaker 3:  they, they fought too thin nail to buy Activision

567
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:15,745
Speaker 3:  because something,

568
00:30:16,095 --> 00:30:20,025
Speaker 4:  Because they wanna have, everybody wants their little fiefdom and you have

569
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:23,465
Speaker 4:  to go and buy the console to get in to play the games rather than just play

570
00:30:23,465 --> 00:30:26,905
Speaker 4:  them on a pc, which they can all theoretically do because

571
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:28,545
Speaker 4:  architecturally they're all the same.

572
00:30:28,775 --> 00:30:32,745
Speaker 3:  Well, sure. But I'm Sony at least has a, well, first of all,

573
00:30:32,745 --> 00:30:34,785
Speaker 3:  it's the winner of this generation. Yeah. 'cause it's

574
00:30:34,785 --> 00:30:35,225
Speaker 4:  Got the good

575
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:38,225
Speaker 3:  Games. If, you don't count the switch. Like it's, it's legit. Which is one

576
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:40,905
Speaker 3:  every generation that it's been anywhere near. Right? Yeah. And the new switch

577
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:44,305
Speaker 3:  we think is coming out that will probably win whatever generation it's a

578
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:47,945
Speaker 3:  part of. Yeah. They, they, the cycles don't quite line up. But Sony has beaten

579
00:30:48,905 --> 00:30:52,425
Speaker 3:  Microsoft pretty soundly this generation. I I hear what you're saying. Like

580
00:30:52,425 --> 00:30:55,665
Speaker 3:  the underlying software or the underlying hardware architectures are similar

581
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:59,705
Speaker 3:  like their a MD chips, but the PS five is

582
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,945
Speaker 3:  a, it's an opinionated device. Yeah. Right.

583
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:07,465
Speaker 3:  It Sony has a lot of thoughts about the PlayStation and what it's for and

584
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,785
Speaker 3:  what the game should work like. And Mark Cerney has a lot of ideas about

585
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:14,825
Speaker 3:  settings. Right? Like there's,

586
00:31:15,055 --> 00:31:18,465
Speaker 3:  there's a vision there for better or worse. And you can not feel it and you

587
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:22,065
Speaker 3:  can be mad about the dis drive. But yeah, Sony has confidence. Microsoft

588
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:25,065
Speaker 3:  has confidence. I think Phil Spencer is a confident person. They have a lot

589
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:28,665
Speaker 3:  of ideas, but actually they're, it feels to me like

590
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:33,025
Speaker 3:  they knew they were losing, they wanted to make a big swing and they

591
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:36,505
Speaker 3:  have just whiffed on a bunch of their big swings. They whiffed on cloud gaming,

592
00:31:36,905 --> 00:31:39,065
Speaker 3:  which was supposed to be the biggest swing of all. They haven't pulled it

593
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:42,905
Speaker 3:  off yet. Yeah. This Activision deal, you know, they let

594
00:31:42,905 --> 00:31:46,865
Speaker 3:  Call of Duty be the side show, but it was really about Candy Crush. And Phil

595
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:50,505
Speaker 3:  has said this to us, mobile gaming is the future and no one has a foothold

596
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:54,305
Speaker 3:  there. We gotta win there. That was also kind of a weird Yeah.

597
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:58,285
Speaker 3:  Side show of cloud gaming and, and none of that. I don't think

598
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:02,165
Speaker 3:  anybody, any consumer, if you're a, if you're a gamer, please,

599
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,525
Speaker 3:  please use the feature in iOS where it makes your emails a little bit nicer.

600
00:32:06,045 --> 00:32:09,885
Speaker 3:  But then email us. I'm curious, did, did Microsoft buying Activision

601
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:13,805
Speaker 3:  improve anything about my playing games for you? Like I don't see

602
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:17,525
Speaker 3:  it yet. And it's true, the deal is pretty new. Yeah. But you,

603
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:21,645
Speaker 3:  you see that what's happening over there is they are looking for a

604
00:32:21,645 --> 00:32:25,525
Speaker 3:  new strategy or a new vision. And I, I think he

605
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:28,565
Speaker 3:  needed that before you made one of the biggest acquisitions of all time.

606
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:32,765
Speaker 4:  But I think Sony's muddied, you talk about it's got this big clear vision.

607
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,965
Speaker 4:  It's muddied that vision because on the one point, hey yeah, you have Astro

608
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:38,965
Speaker 4:  Bott, you have the last of us, you have Spider-Man, you have these games,

609
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,965
Speaker 4:  these first party games that look gorgeous or stunning, play great

610
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:46,885
Speaker 4:  on this thing, have really kind of unique things. Be focused on

611
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:50,725
Speaker 4:  that controller. And then you just have everything else. And, and Microsoft

612
00:32:50,725 --> 00:32:53,805
Speaker 4:  has kind of said, we're gonna be everything else. We're gonna own that space.

613
00:32:54,175 --> 00:32:57,765
Speaker 4:  We're gonna be the PCs, we're gonna bring, you know, kind of gaming pieces

614
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:01,165
Speaker 4:  into the console space. And Sony's now saying the same thing, even though

615
00:33:01,165 --> 00:33:04,405
Speaker 4:  they've got this, this lead, they're saying, yeah, we're gonna do the same

616
00:33:04,405 --> 00:33:07,845
Speaker 4:  thing. We're gonna muddy the waters here. And and I think that's where like

617
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:11,845
Speaker 4:  the PS five Pro doesn't have that clear vision you see in in their games.

618
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:15,645
Speaker 3:  Oh, I think it has one very clear vision. It costs more money costs

619
00:33:15,665 --> 00:33:16,365
Speaker 4:  So much like

620
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:18,165
Speaker 3:  If you're gonna buy. Yeah. Right. Right. Now if you're gonna buy a console,

621
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:21,445
Speaker 3:  is there any or and you already have a switch. Yeah. 'cause that's what you

622
00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:21,765
Speaker 3:  should buy.

623
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,205
Speaker 3:  If you're gonna buy a console, you're gonna buy a PS five. Yeah. Right. Is

624
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,605
Speaker 3:  there, they're the winner. That's what most people have chosen.

625
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:32,765
Speaker 4:  Unless you don't wanna play those first party games. If, you just wanna play

626
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:35,845
Speaker 4:  Call of Duty and stuff. Go get an Xbox. It'll just,

627
00:33:35,845 --> 00:33:37,725
Speaker 5:  Now most people are still gonna buy PlayStations because

628
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:38,205
Speaker 4:  All their friends are

629
00:33:38,205 --> 00:33:40,685
Speaker 5:  On it said that there is like a default choice. It's the PlayStation.

630
00:33:40,755 --> 00:33:43,765
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Right. So then you have a PlayStation and you can discount the regular

631
00:33:43,865 --> 00:33:47,485
Speaker 3:  one because you have, you have your economy of scale. So you can go into

632
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:49,685
Speaker 3:  the holiday and be like, here's the cheap PlayStation like you're saying.

633
00:33:49,755 --> 00:33:53,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You get that series S and then you can ev. But there's

634
00:33:53,555 --> 00:33:56,885
Speaker 3:  some category of people that will just spend more money and you can sit there.

635
00:33:56,885 --> 00:34:00,325
Speaker 3:  We had a CFO at Fox a long time ago. Described his job as waiting to catch

636
00:34:00,325 --> 00:34:03,805
Speaker 3:  the basketball. He's like, I'm just, the money comes and I'm here to get

637
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:06,485
Speaker 3:  it. And I was like, I don't think that's what A CFO does. But it was a learning

638
00:34:06,485 --> 00:34:10,445
Speaker 3:  experience for me. He was great. I think Sony is just like, here's a

639
00:34:10,445 --> 00:34:11,765
Speaker 3:  more expensive one. Catch

640
00:34:11,845 --> 00:34:12,125
Speaker 4:  The money.

641
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:15,605
Speaker 3:  We're just here If, you got some If, you have 300 extra dollars. I do love

642
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:16,165
Speaker 3:  that. We'll take it

643
00:34:16,165 --> 00:34:17,005
Speaker 4:  From you. Yeah, that's true.

644
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:20,605
Speaker 5:  Thi this is the game. Both of these companies have been playing for like

645
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:24,405
Speaker 5:  this whole generation. Right. And Microsoft's bet has

646
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:27,925
Speaker 5:  been for years now that we are on the cusp of a giant

647
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:32,125
Speaker 5:  shift in how this entire industry works. How we play the games, where

648
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,605
Speaker 5:  they are. Yeah. How they're architected. The kinds of games that we play.

649
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:38,565
Speaker 5:  Like Microsoft has been making this bet for a long time now. I

650
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:41,805
Speaker 5:  think Microsoft still thinks it's right and is running out of patience for

651
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:45,485
Speaker 5:  it to actually happen. Sony is just sitting around saying,

652
00:34:46,555 --> 00:34:50,485
Speaker 5:  look at all this money flowing in. Like, and, and then the question will

653
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:54,325
Speaker 5:  be, If, you fast forward a few years, is Microsoft going to be

654
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:58,245
Speaker 5:  right before it gave up? Or is Sony just gonna have so much money

655
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,725
Speaker 5:  at the end of it that who cares? But like Sony is

656
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:05,205
Speaker 5:  basically betting that this shift is going to happen slowly and Microsoft

657
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:07,125
Speaker 5:  is betting that it's gonna happen fast. Okay.

658
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:11,085
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna end by saying one thing that will make everybody mad. Yeah. Or

659
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:13,125
Speaker 3:  that you will completely agree with. I don't think there's a middle ground.

660
00:35:14,035 --> 00:35:17,765
Speaker 3:  It's weird that Microsoft has tried to run away from the idea of the Xbox

661
00:35:17,765 --> 00:35:20,365
Speaker 3:  being a thing that just plays games really well for so long.

662
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:22,805
Speaker 4:  It's never wanted that. Right.

663
00:35:22,835 --> 00:35:26,525
Speaker 3:  It's like the whole Xbox One side quest with where it had

664
00:35:27,265 --> 00:35:31,205
Speaker 3:  IR blasters and HDMI passed. Like what? I don't, people got

665
00:35:31,225 --> 00:35:32,885
Speaker 3:  so mad at me when I was like, this is a disaster.

666
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:36,325
Speaker 5:  My ongoing theory about this is that every once in a while there's an executive

667
00:35:36,325 --> 00:35:39,925
Speaker 5:  meeting at Microsoft and somebody turns to Phil Spencer and goes like, why

668
00:35:39,925 --> 00:35:43,485
Speaker 5:  are you here? And so he has to like explain why Xbox is part of Microsoft

669
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:47,645
Speaker 5:  And eventually that morphed into like talking about Azure and

670
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:48,805
Speaker 5:  then it was just toast,

671
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:52,005
Speaker 3:  Right? Can we run, this is what I mean. Like first, second we're okay, we're

672
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:55,205
Speaker 3:  gonna do it. We're gonna take over the, we're gonna, we're gonna have a dish

673
00:35:55,205 --> 00:35:58,925
Speaker 3:  network integration in the Xbox. Like they were all the way down the rabbit

674
00:35:58,925 --> 00:36:02,125
Speaker 3:  hole of that stuff. And they walked it all back to games and then it was

675
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:05,445
Speaker 3:  reasonably successful again. And then the,

676
00:36:06,315 --> 00:36:09,725
Speaker 3:  this generation, they were starting with games and they're like, well, we

677
00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:12,885
Speaker 3:  lost the Sony. We're gonna stream the games from Azure

678
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:17,305
Speaker 3:  that will disrupt the whole market. And that just has not panned out. No.

679
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:21,105
Speaker 3:  And it just seems like if they, yeah, because they're maybe some focus on

680
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:23,105
Speaker 3:  the main thing would continue to be successful.

681
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:26,825
Speaker 5:  But that's back it up to the first thing and it's a, it's a how do we be

682
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:30,425
Speaker 5:  part of the Windows strategy thing inside of Microsoft and then fast forward

683
00:36:30,425 --> 00:36:33,585
Speaker 5:  to this generation and it's a how do we be part of the cloud first strategy

684
00:36:33,845 --> 00:36:37,665
Speaker 5:  of Microsoft. Like I think there is a very compelling case to be made that

685
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:41,745
Speaker 5:  the best and worst thing going for the Xbox team is that they work for

686
00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:42,185
Speaker 5:  Microsoft.

687
00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:45,265
Speaker 4:  But you know, I was gonna say though, I think part of the reason they've

688
00:36:45,265 --> 00:36:47,905
Speaker 4:  been doing all this flip flopping is because their first party games haven't

689
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:51,775
Speaker 4:  landed the same. Like, they just don't land. Like, like

690
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:56,095
Speaker 4:  Sony's first party games move consoles. People buy consoles for

691
00:36:56,115 --> 00:36:57,095
Speaker 4:  Sony's first party games.

692
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:58,815
Speaker 5:  I don't know. Halo was good for a while.

693
00:36:59,645 --> 00:37:00,975
Speaker 4:  Halo name another one

694
00:37:01,765 --> 00:37:02,255
Speaker 5:  Halo too.

695
00:37:03,435 --> 00:37:06,575
Speaker 4:  You see like, like, and, and Microsoft went on this whole buying spree. They

696
00:37:06,575 --> 00:37:09,175
Speaker 4:  were like, we're gonna buy all of these companies. And then they got, they

697
00:37:09,175 --> 00:37:12,535
Speaker 4:  got told, oh, okay. You cannot make Call of Duty exclusive for you.

698
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:12,855
Speaker 5:  They don't

699
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:16,735
Speaker 4:  Minecraft. Yeah. Not exclusive. Like, like first

700
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:20,695
Speaker 4:  party exclusives. You know, the last of us. Yeah. It's yeah. Spider-Man.

701
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:23,815
Speaker 4:  Those are exclusive. They come to the PC eventually and then you can sort

702
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:26,255
Speaker 4:  of play it through Xbox, I think through the cloud. But

703
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:30,895
Speaker 4:  you have to wait a while. Right? If, you wanna play the Last of Us, which

704
00:37:31,075 --> 00:37:33,695
Speaker 4:  all the other gamers are playing and everybody's talking about you go get

705
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:34,175
Speaker 4:  a pay station.

706
00:37:34,765 --> 00:37:38,015
Speaker 5:  Well, but I, yeah. And, and I think that all like that, that all sort of

707
00:37:38,015 --> 00:37:41,135
Speaker 5:  flows from the same circles, right? Where it's like, okay, if, if our job

708
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:44,415
Speaker 5:  is to sell consoles, how do you sell consoles? You sell consoles with really

709
00:37:44,415 --> 00:37:48,175
Speaker 5:  good games. But if our job is to like increase the market share of,

710
00:37:48,195 --> 00:37:51,815
Speaker 5:  of our cl or cloud services arm of our company, you just

711
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:53,655
Speaker 5:  prioritize things very differently.

712
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:57,095
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I think full sensor would take deep issue with that

713
00:37:57,095 --> 00:38:00,935
Speaker 3:  characterization of Xbox. But it's always a little more true

714
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:03,335
Speaker 3:  than maybe wants to be. Yeah. By the way, can I just read you the first paragraph

715
00:38:03,335 --> 00:38:05,335
Speaker 3:  of his note announcing these layoffs

716
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:10,575
Speaker 3:  for the past? This is Phil Spencer, his memo to Microsoft employees

717
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:14,145
Speaker 3:  for the past year. Our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming

718
00:38:14,145 --> 00:38:17,895
Speaker 3:  new teams and enabling to do their best work. As part of aligning our post

719
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,895
Speaker 3:  acquisition team structure, managing our business, we've made decision to

720
00:38:20,895 --> 00:38:24,655
Speaker 3:  eliminate approximately 650 roles. We welcome. You're fired.

721
00:38:25,045 --> 00:38:25,335
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

722
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:29,455
Speaker 5:  That's tough. And then at the end of it, he like, we've had some good days

723
00:38:29,455 --> 00:38:32,535
Speaker 5:  and we've had some bad days and this is a bad day. It's like, thanks though.

724
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:35,765
Speaker 3:  I mean, there's no good way to write those notes. No there's not. I think

725
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:38,805
Speaker 3:  mergers are bad. That's all I'm saying. I think generally they lead to chaos

726
00:38:38,905 --> 00:38:42,845
Speaker 3:  and disruption in actually smaller companies with less focus or less

727
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:46,885
Speaker 3:  ambition. What do I, I suspect that will be in the long run true of the

728
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:47,685
Speaker 3:  ion deal. Are

729
00:38:47,685 --> 00:38:49,645
Speaker 4:  You saying Warner Brothers Discovery isn't a good company.

730
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:53,765
Speaker 3:  We gotta go. We got, we gotta take a break. All right. Yeah, we're taking

731
00:38:53,805 --> 00:38:57,685
Speaker 3:  a break. We'll, we'll talk about whatever Zla is doing a little bit later.

732
00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:58,365
Speaker 3:  We'll be right back.

733
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:06,285
Speaker 3:  We're back and we have the most breaking news of all

734
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:10,485
Speaker 3:  in the middle of our break. Literally in the middle of our break,

735
00:40:11,715 --> 00:40:15,695
Speaker 3:  Google put up a blog post announcing the developer preview

736
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:17,975
Speaker 3:  of desktop windowing and Android tablets.

737
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:22,885
Speaker 3:  I know that the audience is as lit up by this as we are,

738
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:27,555
Speaker 3:  but I have to tell you, this whole room got so distracted that we

739
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:31,355
Speaker 3:  almost forgot to start the show again in the middle of the break. Just looking

740
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:32,155
Speaker 3:  at this blog post,

741
00:40:32,905 --> 00:40:33,315
Speaker 4:  It's a good

742
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:36,755
Speaker 3:  Blog post. If you're a Dex head, just know

743
00:40:37,345 --> 00:40:41,275
Speaker 3:  your empire is falling crumbling. Brick by brick is Google

744
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:45,275
Speaker 3:  ruthlessly sherlock's your entire, your entire operating

745
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:48,695
Speaker 3:  system away from you. So basically you have pixel fold, which

746
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:52,215
Speaker 3:  feels like one of the hotter phones going right now. David just got one.

747
00:40:52,355 --> 00:40:56,295
Speaker 3:  Yep. It's sitting here in a FedEx box on my desk. Liam

748
00:40:56,515 --> 00:41:00,455
Speaker 3:  has a pixel watch on right now and a pixel fold. And a pixel fold. 'cause

749
00:41:00,455 --> 00:41:03,415
Speaker 3:  he bought a pixel fold and now he's in the ecosystem. I'm seeing him. People

750
00:41:03,435 --> 00:41:07,355
Speaker 3:  are excited about this phone. And so Google, which has,

751
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:11,075
Speaker 3:  Liam was trying to run the pixel fold on a desktop monitor the other day

752
00:41:11,355 --> 00:41:14,795
Speaker 3:  and it was the saddest thing I've ever seen. One time. It's adorable. Truly

753
00:41:14,795 --> 00:41:18,675
Speaker 3:  the like no, literally no affordance for running with

754
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:22,195
Speaker 3:  a keyboard and display. Like it's just, here's your pixel fold. Like here's

755
00:41:22,195 --> 00:41:23,795
Speaker 3:  a media Android tablet and it's

756
00:41:23,795 --> 00:41:24,115
Speaker 4:  Still square.

757
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,475
Speaker 3:  It was still square's, right? It was beautiful. Everything about it was great.

758
00:41:27,815 --> 00:41:31,515
Speaker 3:  As you know, Samsung has decks, as Vergecast listeners know, Samsung has

759
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:34,725
Speaker 3:  this thing called decks, which is the desktop mode for its phones. There's

760
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,685
Speaker 3:  a lot of weird decks stuff going on.

761
00:41:38,315 --> 00:41:41,965
Speaker 3:  Literally different skews of the same phone and the Samsung lineup

762
00:41:42,305 --> 00:41:44,525
Speaker 3:  run different versions of decks with different capabilities.

763
00:41:44,555 --> 00:41:45,485
Speaker 5:  Samsung baby,

764
00:41:45,825 --> 00:41:47,525
Speaker 3:  It is just not a thing you can depend

765
00:41:47,525 --> 00:41:47,725
Speaker 5:  On.

766
00:41:48,345 --> 00:41:52,285
Speaker 3:  As someone who has desperately tried to live the Dex lifestyle, the

767
00:41:52,285 --> 00:41:55,725
Speaker 3:  only person I know who ever pulled it off successfully is Dan ert, our former

768
00:41:55,725 --> 00:41:59,365
Speaker 3:  reviews editor who now works at Google because Google was like, Dan, can

769
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:02,045
Speaker 3:  you explain what is going on? Samsung device. Curious.

770
00:42:02,505 --> 00:42:05,725
Speaker 5:  So I was gonna ask. Yeah. So there, there, there's a, there's a man named

771
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:09,365
Speaker 5:  Dieter Bone there also works at Google who also was a big

772
00:42:09,765 --> 00:42:13,245
Speaker 5:  believer in window freedom. I would say.

773
00:42:14,385 --> 00:42:17,965
Speaker 5:  And and then Dan America's number one Dex user. Yeah.

774
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:19,245
Speaker 5:  Google goes to

775
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,725
Speaker 3:  Google the one and only Dex user. Yeah.

776
00:42:20,725 --> 00:42:24,405
Speaker 5:  Listen still number one man goes to Google.

777
00:42:25,515 --> 00:42:27,645
Speaker 5:  Does The Verge get credit for this feature? Yes.

778
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,445
Speaker 3:  This is us. This is our alumni. Right. We, I feel like we did this. I think

779
00:42:30,445 --> 00:42:34,365
Speaker 3:  that, and we don't actually, we don't. I'm still, you

780
00:42:34,365 --> 00:42:37,045
Speaker 3:  know, we're all good friends. We just learned to not talk about work anymore.

781
00:42:37,045 --> 00:42:40,685
Speaker 3:  Which is weird for people that worked in media together. Especially,

782
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:44,085
Speaker 3:  we just don't, I see data, we talk about anything else? So, I Don't know.

783
00:42:44,205 --> 00:42:46,045
Speaker 3:  I, I have no, we have no inside info and I

784
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:51,125
Speaker 3:  maintain that line 'cause I like talking to Dieter and he's my friend.

785
00:42:51,865 --> 00:42:55,765
Speaker 3:  So we just enforce this. It's, we had to like learn what to talk about that

786
00:42:55,765 --> 00:42:59,645
Speaker 3:  wasn't work and or gadgets. Very weird. So, I Dunno.

787
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:02,445
Speaker 3:  But I'm just taking credit for it. Yeah. I'm saying with no literally no

788
00:43:02,605 --> 00:43:05,925
Speaker 3:  evidence. And actually like an ideological

789
00:43:06,565 --> 00:43:07,725
Speaker 3:  resistance to knowing Yeah.

790
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:10,805
Speaker 5:  And a deep knowledge of that not being how it works. Yes.

791
00:43:11,695 --> 00:43:13,805
Speaker 5:  We're still taking credit. We're still taking credit for

792
00:43:13,805 --> 00:43:17,485
Speaker 3:  It. Absolutely. We will send our armies into your house and introduce

793
00:43:17,485 --> 00:43:18,405
Speaker 3:  desktop windowing.

794
00:43:19,215 --> 00:43:21,205
Speaker 5:  Could not agree more. I'm into it. So,

795
00:43:21,205 --> 00:43:23,885
Speaker 3:  Okay, here's what's actually going on. It's just a developer preview right

796
00:43:23,885 --> 00:43:27,645
Speaker 3:  now. They're showing it mostly in a pixel tablet. I have to imagine that

797
00:43:27,645 --> 00:43:30,485
Speaker 3:  this is gonna be what will happen on pixel fold, which very much acts like

798
00:43:30,485 --> 00:43:34,365
Speaker 3:  a tablet when you unfold it. Yeah. You can just freeform windows. You can

799
00:43:34,365 --> 00:43:37,725
Speaker 3:  just run Android, like a desktop operating system. You, you pull a chrome

800
00:43:37,725 --> 00:43:41,285
Speaker 3:  window down and it opens a window with a nav bar and

801
00:43:41,515 --> 00:43:44,325
Speaker 3:  tabs like, like navigation. It

802
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:44,525
Speaker 4:  Should,

803
00:43:45,795 --> 00:43:49,515
Speaker 3:  I think there's some weirdness here between what is a Chrome OS

804
00:43:49,515 --> 00:43:53,195
Speaker 3:  device and what is an, like the Google weirdness here is

805
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:54,035
Speaker 3:  very powerful.

806
00:43:54,745 --> 00:43:58,475
Speaker 4:  Like the, the Chrome OS team just saw this and is like, what the hell?

807
00:43:59,415 --> 00:44:03,235
Speaker 3:  Or they're like, aren't we on the same team, you know is with Google. Yes.

808
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:07,435
Speaker 3:  So there's some weirdness here about just the differences in between the

809
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:11,395
Speaker 3:  apps. Like Chromos can run Android apps. Weird that that

810
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:14,195
Speaker 3:  came to nothing as most of these ideas generally come to nothing.

811
00:44:15,335 --> 00:44:18,625
Speaker 3:  But the idea that Google is taking

812
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:20,705
Speaker 3:  a bigger step forward

813
00:44:22,395 --> 00:44:26,135
Speaker 3:  in particular with the fold. 'cause I don't think Android tablets is a thing

814
00:44:26,135 --> 00:44:29,255
Speaker 3:  really matter if they free from windowing. But part in particular with the

815
00:44:29,255 --> 00:44:33,045
Speaker 3:  fold and foldable Android devices that when you're closed, they act like

816
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:37,005
Speaker 3:  Android phones. And when they're open they have freeform windows that

817
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:40,765
Speaker 3:  can be useful in a variety of like computing situations.

818
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:44,685
Speaker 3:  That's a big deal. Like Right, it feels like a big deal. They have to actually

819
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:48,445
Speaker 3:  chip it, it has to like work. But this is the thing that everybody

820
00:44:48,445 --> 00:44:51,805
Speaker 3:  wants, right? You just carry your phone to work and you plug it in and it's

821
00:44:51,805 --> 00:44:53,645
Speaker 3:  a computer. We're a little bit closer there.

822
00:44:54,065 --> 00:44:57,845
Speaker 4:  I'm sorry, I, I'm just looking at the, the desktop windowing

823
00:44:57,855 --> 00:45:01,835
Speaker 4:  thing they have and it feels like the person, the sample

824
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:04,715
Speaker 4:  they're using here, the person is lying about going to Tahoe,

825
00:45:07,015 --> 00:45:09,355
Speaker 3:  The ta Oh, this is so Gemini can summarize it.

826
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:13,235
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The Tahoe debrief and then behind that you see they've been Googling

827
00:45:13,365 --> 00:45:13,715
Speaker 4:  Tahoe.

828
00:45:16,275 --> 00:45:17,995
Speaker 4:  Interesting. Interesting.

829
00:45:18,345 --> 00:45:21,555
Speaker 3:  They're like Gemini, summarize this webpage about Tahoe in an email about

830
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:22,235
Speaker 3:  my trip to Tahoe.

831
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:24,555
Speaker 4:  Like Windows

832
00:45:26,505 --> 00:45:27,995
Speaker 4:  calling you out there a little bit.

833
00:45:28,215 --> 00:45:31,355
Speaker 3:  That's good. I will say, yeah, you're right that the, they're like on a video

834
00:45:31,425 --> 00:45:35,275
Speaker 3:  call, they're doing an email while they're searching for literally

835
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:36,235
Speaker 3:  just the word Tahoe.

836
00:45:37,955 --> 00:45:39,115
Speaker 3:  A little, A little weird. A

837
00:45:39,115 --> 00:45:41,995
Speaker 4:  Little weird. But these look, I, I don't know, I, I think these windows look

838
00:45:41,995 --> 00:45:44,995
Speaker 4:  nice. They seem to move smoothly and a little gifs we're seeing

839
00:45:45,265 --> 00:45:48,955
Speaker 5:  It's such a know, such rising tide lifts all boats thing too. Because

840
00:45:49,095 --> 00:45:52,835
Speaker 5:  the biggest challenge for Android apps on Chrome

841
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:56,875
Speaker 5:  os once they got past some of the like basic compatibility

842
00:45:56,875 --> 00:46:00,675
Speaker 5:  issues has been that Android apps look

843
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:04,595
Speaker 5:  like buts when they're big. Right? Like overwhelmingly, and this

844
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,635
Speaker 5:  is a thing that, that Apple has had really good luck with over the years

845
00:46:07,655 --> 00:46:11,515
Speaker 5:  and it has served Apple really well, is making apps look

846
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:15,435
Speaker 5:  good at different sizes. Google has struggled forever to get developers

847
00:46:15,435 --> 00:46:19,395
Speaker 5:  to care about anything other than the vertical size of a

848
00:46:19,395 --> 00:46:23,275
Speaker 5:  smartphone. And one of the reasons people like to build apps

849
00:46:23,335 --> 00:46:27,195
Speaker 5:  for iOS before they build for even Android smartphones is

850
00:46:27,195 --> 00:46:30,995
Speaker 5:  because the screen sizes are different. Like it's so hard to build a go to

851
00:46:30,995 --> 00:46:33,595
Speaker 5:  Android app because you essentially have to build a hundred of them that

852
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:36,275
Speaker 5:  all look slightly different at slightly different orientations at slightly

853
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:40,035
Speaker 5:  different sizes. So like the idea of there just being one

854
00:46:41,315 --> 00:46:44,395
Speaker 5:  software of one screen size is very appealing to people, which is why a lot

855
00:46:44,395 --> 00:46:48,275
Speaker 5:  of people like to build iOS apps. What Google has made an effort to

856
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:51,475
Speaker 5:  do over the last few years, it has not done it exceptionally well, but it

857
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:55,355
Speaker 5:  has done it relatively well, is get people to build these more flexible

858
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:59,075
Speaker 5:  apps that work at tablet size and they work at smartphone

859
00:46:59,075 --> 00:47:02,835
Speaker 5:  size and they work at the size of a laptop screen to run on Chrome

860
00:47:02,895 --> 00:47:06,835
Speaker 5:  os. And so every bit of it that gets better on one of those makes it

861
00:47:06,835 --> 00:47:09,715
Speaker 5:  better for all of them, right? So like the pixel fold being good this year

862
00:47:09,715 --> 00:47:12,555
Speaker 5:  should be very exciting to people who own Chromebooks because it's gonna

863
00:47:12,555 --> 00:47:15,235
Speaker 5:  make people who make Android apps make them better for the fold, which will

864
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:17,715
Speaker 5:  make them better on the Chromebook. And every one of these pieces just gets

865
00:47:17,715 --> 00:47:21,315
Speaker 5:  better and better as time goes on. Which I think like, and for this, again,

866
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:26,275
Speaker 5:  I can't imagine there are that many Pixel tablet users out there in the

867
00:47:26,275 --> 00:47:30,005
Speaker 5:  world, but like, this is just a step again, in that

868
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:30,325
Speaker 5:  direction.

869
00:47:30,615 --> 00:47:34,485
Speaker 4:  Dan's just so happy somewhere. I, I do have one question. Does,

870
00:47:34,635 --> 00:47:38,325
Speaker 4:  does Android design, like, do they not have responsive design

871
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,645
Speaker 4:  where you just like, okay, you make it, and

872
00:47:40,675 --> 00:47:44,005
Speaker 3:  They do in this, in this context, it's called Adaptive. Okay. So they, they've

873
00:47:44,005 --> 00:47:46,445
Speaker 3:  been, they've been, and they pushing that for a long time. Yeah. I,

874
00:47:46,665 --> 00:47:49,885
Speaker 5:  But adaptive is not a checkbox, right? Like it's, it's not a thing that you

875
00:47:49,885 --> 00:47:53,805
Speaker 5:  say that make my app adaptive like that you, you have to build it Yeah.

876
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:56,685
Speaker 5:  To be all of those things and that's, it takes work.

877
00:47:56,865 --> 00:47:59,885
Speaker 4:  So they don't have like a tool set that'll be like boop, boop, boop, boop,

878
00:48:00,565 --> 00:48:00,645
Speaker 4:  adaptive.

879
00:48:00,905 --> 00:48:03,085
Speaker 5:  So they, they do, you'll see some apps, and this is why like there are a

880
00:48:03,085 --> 00:48:06,885
Speaker 5:  lot of iOS apps that look the same on an iPad

881
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:10,325
Speaker 5:  because you can basically just sort of like paint by numbers into a template

882
00:48:10,325 --> 00:48:13,965
Speaker 5:  and it'll do it at all the different sizes. And some folks do that and that's

883
00:48:13,965 --> 00:48:17,885
Speaker 5:  fine. But like If, you want to build an app with different ideas about

884
00:48:17,885 --> 00:48:21,725
Speaker 5:  navigation or different animations or like, like literally to load a page

885
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,085
Speaker 5:  at all the different sizes and Android device can be,

886
00:48:26,205 --> 00:48:29,185
Speaker 5:  is a challenge, especially If, you like care about how it looks and works,

887
00:48:30,245 --> 00:48:33,385
Speaker 5:  and then you throw in all the different devices and all the different, you

888
00:48:33,385 --> 00:48:37,345
Speaker 5:  know, screen refresh rates and there's just so many variables. But the,

889
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:41,185
Speaker 5:  the sheer raw, like x by y size of the app

890
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:45,345
Speaker 5:  has been the biggest holdup for Google forever because it just, it's a thing

891
00:48:45,345 --> 00:48:48,985
Speaker 5:  people have not invested in doing because Android

892
00:48:49,015 --> 00:48:52,545
Speaker 5:  tablets were not any good Android apps and Chromebooks didn't work and nobody

893
00:48:52,545 --> 00:48:55,105
Speaker 5:  cared about foldable phones. And so like, as each one of those gets better,

894
00:48:55,105 --> 00:48:56,785
Speaker 5:  they all get better. And that's very cool.

895
00:48:56,785 --> 00:48:59,705
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I, I think I'm just kinda surprised. 'cause like in, in web design

896
00:48:59,725 --> 00:49:02,465
Speaker 4:  we had this whole moment where everybody was like, you know, you can just

897
00:49:03,225 --> 00:49:06,265
Speaker 4:  download this little theme and it's a responsive theme and it's gonna automatically

898
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:09,945
Speaker 4:  resize it for anything you do. And the fact that Google doesn't just have

899
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:11,905
Speaker 4:  like, here's here's the lazy way. Well,

900
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:15,385
Speaker 5:  No, but somebody built that theme that's like, that theme doesn't just exist.

901
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:15,785
Speaker 5:  Well, you

902
00:49:15,785 --> 00:49:19,225
Speaker 3:  If you listen carefully. That's the sound of every web designer listening

903
00:49:19,225 --> 00:49:20,105
Speaker 3:  to the show screaming.

904
00:49:20,185 --> 00:49:21,105
Speaker 4:  Exactly. You're welcome.

905
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:23,945
Speaker 4:  I'd like to piss you off. You

906
00:49:23,945 --> 00:49:25,305
Speaker 5:  Know, just a WordPress cream that just exists.

907
00:49:25,945 --> 00:49:26,105
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

908
00:49:26,105 --> 00:49:28,945
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I paid $40 for it on theme force

909
00:49:28,945 --> 00:49:32,905
Speaker 3:  Taking our thank you site from Desktop mobile. We had an

910
00:49:32,985 --> 00:49:36,945
Speaker 3:  Mdot site for a minute to responsive was nightmare. Just a

911
00:49:36,965 --> 00:49:37,185
Speaker 3:  few.

912
00:49:37,185 --> 00:49:40,625
Speaker 5:  Responsive design is really hard. Yeah, it's really hard. It's gotten a lot

913
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:44,225
Speaker 5:  easier because it has become so much more important, but it is really hard.

914
00:49:44,225 --> 00:49:47,145
Speaker 4:  Well, I think my question is why doesn't Google do that work?

915
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:50,415
Speaker 3:  Actually, can I tell you a fun fact about responsive design?

916
00:49:52,765 --> 00:49:53,565
Speaker 4:  I love a fun fact.

917
00:49:54,145 --> 00:49:57,885
Speaker 3:  My fun fact about responsive design is that it was a Vox media designer,

918
00:49:58,085 --> 00:50:01,365
Speaker 3:  Scott Kellum, who invented some of the very first responsive design

919
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,085
Speaker 3:  prototypes. Well really? That's

920
00:50:03,105 --> 00:50:03,685
Speaker 4:  That's awesome.

921
00:50:03,955 --> 00:50:05,725
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And he was like, let's take guess. He was like, look at this thing.

922
00:50:05,725 --> 00:50:08,085
Speaker 3:  He was like showing us stretchy web windows. And I was like, make our site

923
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:11,645
Speaker 3:  do that. And then the office led into flame

924
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:12,605
Speaker 3:  and talked for a long time.

925
00:50:13,025 --> 00:50:13,565
Speaker 5:  That's awesome.

926
00:50:14,115 --> 00:50:18,085
Speaker 3:  Yeah. See that was live Breaking Gadget news on the rich cast. We

927
00:50:18,085 --> 00:50:21,725
Speaker 3:  still, our hearts still a flame when there's Android

928
00:50:21,725 --> 00:50:24,085
Speaker 3:  windowing. Yeah, we're still, we're still where we came from.

929
00:50:26,965 --> 00:50:29,395
Speaker 3:  David, I think you think that next story is very funny.

930
00:50:30,115 --> 00:50:31,475
Speaker 5:  I do think the next story is very funny.

931
00:50:31,655 --> 00:50:33,235
Speaker 3:  All right, make the case buddy.

932
00:50:33,545 --> 00:50:36,995
Speaker 5:  Okay, so there was a debate. Well, let me back, let me back up.

933
00:50:37,515 --> 00:50:40,955
Speaker 5:  So, so there's an election happening in the United States, actually let back

934
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:41,955
Speaker 5:  up. So well founding,

935
00:50:42,135 --> 00:50:43,915
Speaker 3:  Do we know where Trump stands in Android windowing?

936
00:50:45,775 --> 00:50:46,795
Speaker 4:  He doesn't like it. Which

937
00:50:47,105 --> 00:50:50,075
Speaker 5:  Candidate do you think is more likely to use texts in the office?

938
00:50:50,745 --> 00:50:54,115
Speaker 4:  Neither one of 'em was a lawyer. She's using like word perfect

939
00:50:54,855 --> 00:50:55,315
Speaker 3:  Tim Walls.

940
00:50:55,975 --> 00:50:57,915
Speaker 4:  Mm. Ooh, that's a good one.

941
00:50:58,095 --> 00:51:01,355
Speaker 5:  Tim is definitely on like a Galaxy note just because he wanted the, you see

942
00:51:01,355 --> 00:51:01,595
Speaker 5:  what I'm

943
00:51:01,595 --> 00:51:02,475
Speaker 3:  Saying? And he refused to

944
00:51:02,575 --> 00:51:03,435
Speaker 5:  He can feel it. Yeah,

945
00:51:03,865 --> 00:51:04,755
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah.

946
00:51:05,255 --> 00:51:09,115
Speaker 5:  Tim has a foldable keyboard in his backpack at all times. That feels

947
00:51:09,115 --> 00:51:09,955
Speaker 5:  exactly right to me.

948
00:51:10,415 --> 00:51:13,155
Speaker 3:  JD Vance is like, here's what I want to do. I want to, I want to nationalize

949
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:15,035
Speaker 3:  iMessage. Like that's where his brain is at.

950
00:51:15,415 --> 00:51:18,355
Speaker 5:  By the way, have I told you guys about how we discovered very recently that

951
00:51:18,415 --> 00:51:21,515
Speaker 5:  JD Vance has a house like right down the street from me and there's now a,

952
00:51:21,635 --> 00:51:25,435
Speaker 5:  a secret service motorcade that goes by my house like almost

953
00:51:25,435 --> 00:51:26,355
Speaker 5:  every day. Oh

954
00:51:26,355 --> 00:51:26,515
Speaker 4:  Wow.

955
00:51:26,615 --> 00:51:29,075
Speaker 5:  That's the whole story. That's it. That's all I wanted to tell you. Cool.

956
00:51:29,075 --> 00:51:32,115
Speaker 5:  There's now a park that is like the size of this room that's fake behind

957
00:51:32,115 --> 00:51:36,035
Speaker 5:  me that is now closed because it's too close to JD Vance's house. And that's

958
00:51:36,035 --> 00:51:38,115
Speaker 5:  how everyone in this neighborhood found out that JD Vance has a house here,

959
00:51:38,215 --> 00:51:38,435
Speaker 5:  but

960
00:51:38,435 --> 00:51:42,195
Speaker 3:  He's never there. He's walking in a donut shops across America, confusing

961
00:51:42,195 --> 00:51:42,755
Speaker 3:  the population.

962
00:51:43,035 --> 00:51:45,315
Speaker 5:  Apparently one of them might be in my neighborhood. I'm gonna have to start

963
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:48,435
Speaker 5:  walking into donut shops every day just to see if I can find JD Vance. Anyway,

964
00:51:48,435 --> 00:51:50,395
Speaker 4:  Let's, let's talk about the earrings. There's

965
00:51:50,395 --> 00:51:54,355
Speaker 5:  A debate. Kamala Harris was wearing earrings and that became tech news

966
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:57,355
Speaker 5:  because there was a set of people on the internet who advanced a clearly

967
00:51:57,375 --> 00:52:00,755
Speaker 5:  not correct theory that the earrings she was wearing were actually

968
00:52:00,755 --> 00:52:04,675
Speaker 5:  headphones. And I just, I brought this up for

969
00:52:04,695 --> 00:52:08,195
Speaker 5:  two reasons. One, because it's not true, and this is like a thing that

970
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:12,275
Speaker 5:  people have tried to do for years. The idea that a, the

971
00:52:12,275 --> 00:52:15,715
Speaker 5:  candidate who does well in a debate is being fed answers in some way, shape,

972
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:19,115
Speaker 5:  or form is like a long running conspiracy theory that's never proven true.

973
00:52:19,655 --> 00:52:23,595
Speaker 5:  But BI think it's very funny that the earrings in particular that

974
00:52:23,595 --> 00:52:27,515
Speaker 5:  she's being accused of wearing, there's some strong evidence

975
00:52:28,665 --> 00:52:32,155
Speaker 5:  that they don't actually exist. This is like a Kickstarter company

976
00:52:32,505 --> 00:52:36,355
Speaker 5:  that doesn't really seem to have shipped. Like in

977
00:52:36,515 --> 00:52:39,555
Speaker 5:  fairness, we have not covered this company closely, so maybe there's more

978
00:52:39,555 --> 00:52:43,035
Speaker 5:  out there. If, you are an owner of Nova H one headphones.

979
00:52:43,655 --> 00:52:46,115
Speaker 5:  Get at me. I have a lot of questions. Believe you. I wanna know everything.

980
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:46,435
Speaker 5:  Believe you

981
00:52:46,435 --> 00:52:47,795
Speaker 4:  Need audio earrings. Oh

982
00:52:47,795 --> 00:52:50,155
Speaker 5:  My God, you're right. I apologize. The H one audio earrings,

983
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:55,535
Speaker 5:  they just aren't what she was wearing. Yeah, they,

984
00:52:55,685 --> 00:52:56,815
Speaker 3:  They look very different

985
00:52:57,115 --> 00:52:59,695
Speaker 5:  If every, it would've been funnier if everybody's like, she's wearing beats,

986
00:52:59,695 --> 00:53:00,815
Speaker 5:  but they're like, she's wearing a

987
00:53:01,175 --> 00:53:04,895
Speaker 4:  Project. Yeah. The only similarity is they both have a pearl on them. Like

988
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,375
Speaker 4:  they're pearl earrings. That's it. Everybody's

989
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:10,775
Speaker 3:  Like, the fact that the CEO is out there being like, I can't confirm or deny

990
00:53:10,775 --> 00:53:14,135
Speaker 3:  that these are our fake earrings is like, well one, what are you doing? The

991
00:53:14,135 --> 00:53:14,255
Speaker 3:  fact

992
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:16,655
Speaker 4:  That the guy who can't ship his product to saying that. Yeah.

993
00:53:16,815 --> 00:53:19,615
Speaker 5:  And also the battery life only lasts two and a half hours, which means they

994
00:53:19,775 --> 00:53:22,855
Speaker 5:  probably would've died like mid debate if we're being, if we're being realistic,

995
00:53:23,585 --> 00:53:27,285
Speaker 4:  She's putting him on right before she goes out. Yeah, just

996
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:28,285
Speaker 4:  give 'em to me, let's go.

997
00:53:29,025 --> 00:53:29,245
Speaker 3:  She

998
00:53:29,245 --> 00:53:31,885
Speaker 5:  Takes off her earrings, mid debate, puts them in a charging case, takes him

999
00:53:31,885 --> 00:53:32,245
Speaker 5:  back out.

1000
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:36,725
Speaker 3:  There was a very funny in the in gadget days, way back when,

1001
00:53:37,035 --> 00:53:41,005
Speaker 3:  when Obama was first elected, there

1002
00:53:41,005 --> 00:53:44,645
Speaker 3:  was all these reports that he wanted to keep his blackberry, I dunno, If

1003
00:53:44,645 --> 00:53:48,325
Speaker 3:  you remember this. It was like frothing at the mouth, will Obama get a blackberry?

1004
00:53:48,945 --> 00:53:52,445
Speaker 3:  And then there was all this stuff about he would need like a secret blackberry.

1005
00:53:52,845 --> 00:53:56,725
Speaker 3:  It was like ultra lockdown. And he really wanted his Blackberry. And there

1006
00:53:56,725 --> 00:54:00,245
Speaker 3:  was this company that made a phone called the SEC Edge and the

1007
00:54:00,525 --> 00:54:02,965
Speaker 3:  CEO of that, I don't remember what they're called. I don't know what the,

1008
00:54:03,005 --> 00:54:06,725
Speaker 3:  I, I refuse to remember, but the CEO of this company is this like military

1009
00:54:07,065 --> 00:54:10,725
Speaker 3:  vendor guy. And he's just like on all the TV channels being like, the Sectary

1010
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:14,165
Speaker 3:  Edge is the most hardened military grade, blah, blah, blah. And everyone's

1011
00:54:14,165 --> 00:54:17,445
Speaker 3:  like, Obama's getting a sect edge. And like, definitely not. He ended up

1012
00:54:17,445 --> 00:54:21,165
Speaker 3:  like a black 38,000 that was just like stripped of

1013
00:54:21,365 --> 00:54:25,285
Speaker 3:  its apps. And then later on he had an iPad and it's like, why did

1014
00:54:25,285 --> 00:54:29,005
Speaker 3:  we spend so much time talking about the sector edge? I think Josh Polsky

1015
00:54:29,005 --> 00:54:31,845
Speaker 3:  had a post in Eng Gadget during those days where he was like, it's not the

1016
00:54:31,845 --> 00:54:35,765
Speaker 3:  SuperPhone 9,000, it's Blackberry. Like that

1017
00:54:35,765 --> 00:54:36,605
Speaker 3:  was like the headline.

1018
00:54:37,895 --> 00:54:38,465
Speaker 5:  It's pretty good.

1019
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,065
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1020
00:54:39,565 --> 00:54:42,865
Speaker 4:  I'm learning so much about they they were not technically smartphones,

1021
00:54:43,005 --> 00:54:43,825
Speaker 3:  The sex edge,

1022
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:45,985
Speaker 4:  Which was made by general dynamic. Yeah.

1023
00:54:46,005 --> 00:54:49,025
Speaker 3:  See, I knew it was like, he's like, here's what we do. Cruise missiles and

1024
00:54:49,025 --> 00:54:50,625
Speaker 3:  this weird feature phone for the government.

1025
00:54:50,865 --> 00:54:53,745
Speaker 5:  Well that was like, remember the Boeing Black that Boeing was like, he made

1026
00:54:53,745 --> 00:54:56,345
Speaker 5:  a super secure smartphone. Like this is a whole, it's it's a whole genre

1027
00:54:56,945 --> 00:54:57,745
Speaker 5:  floating out there. There

1028
00:54:57,745 --> 00:55:01,505
Speaker 3:  Are many stories during the Trump era that I spent much too much time

1029
00:55:01,735 --> 00:55:02,425
Speaker 3:  focused on.

1030
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:03,905
Speaker 4:  Are I I where

1031
00:55:03,905 --> 00:55:06,665
Speaker 3:  You're going Fox on in particular? Yeah, but I don't know If, you remember

1032
00:55:06,895 --> 00:55:10,345
Speaker 3:  they would always describe him as having a super TiVo in the White House.

1033
00:55:10,685 --> 00:55:14,225
Speaker 3:  Oh yeah. Like Trump would watch like his super TiVo and he kept referring

1034
00:55:14,225 --> 00:55:18,025
Speaker 3:  to it as a super TiVo and like, you know, America's political reporters are

1035
00:55:18,025 --> 00:55:21,145
Speaker 3:  not being like, what's a super ti like, I get it. But I was like, what's

1036
00:55:21,145 --> 00:55:24,985
Speaker 3:  a super TiVo? Like I've had every TiVo that's ever shipped. Which one

1037
00:55:24,985 --> 00:55:28,865
Speaker 3:  is it? Is is there a, that company is now a patent licensing troll. Like

1038
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:33,105
Speaker 3:  which TiVo is it? Dude. And it was just a bog standard direct

1039
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:36,545
Speaker 3:  TV box. And one time they pub someone published a photo of the super TIVA

1040
00:55:36,545 --> 00:55:40,425
Speaker 3:  remote and it was a $4 like white direct TV remote,

1041
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:48,065
Speaker 5:  But somebody like painted a racing stripe on it. So like super Tiva phone.

1042
00:55:48,485 --> 00:55:52,225
Speaker 3:  It was just like, dude, he's got direct tv. Like I'm aware that it can record

1043
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:54,785
Speaker 3:  four channels at once, but like, so can everything.

1044
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:58,785
Speaker 5:  Honestly, I think if DirecTV had rebranded as super TiVo, it would probably

1045
00:55:58,785 --> 00:55:59,545
Speaker 5:  have been more successful.

1046
00:55:59,645 --> 00:56:03,425
Speaker 3:  The one Trump has Senior Citizens of America, you, you can all have

1047
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:04,305
Speaker 3:  DirecTV together.

1048
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:07,945
Speaker 5:  It's a remote, but it like has the cover on it so you can only hit two buttons

1049
00:56:07,945 --> 00:56:09,225
Speaker 5:  just to make sure. It

1050
00:56:09,225 --> 00:56:12,865
Speaker 4:  Is very sad that everybody just assumed Kamala Harris' earrings were

1051
00:56:13,175 --> 00:56:13,665
Speaker 4:  earbuds.

1052
00:56:14,085 --> 00:56:17,785
Speaker 5:  Do you think Tim Wal has ever backed to Kickstarter? That's my last question

1053
00:56:17,785 --> 00:56:18,065
Speaker 5:  for you.

1054
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:19,185
Speaker 4:  A hundred percent.

1055
00:56:20,745 --> 00:56:23,600
Speaker 3:  I mean, JD Vance specked at Kickstarter over throw the, the cover from the

1056
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,080
Speaker 3:  United States.

1057
00:56:25,975 --> 00:56:29,965
Speaker 3:  Let's move on. There you go. I will cop to getting this wrong. Me at

1058
00:56:29,965 --> 00:56:32,285
Speaker 3:  the top of the show, I said it was honor because honor has also been hinting

1059
00:56:32,285 --> 00:56:35,525
Speaker 3:  at a trifold smartphone, but it's actually the Huawei trifold smartphone.

1060
00:56:36,245 --> 00:56:39,645
Speaker 3:  It's $2,800. It looks sick again. Huawei got like

1061
00:56:39,825 --> 00:56:42,885
Speaker 3:  booted outta the country, you will recall and almost went out of business

1062
00:56:42,885 --> 00:56:45,765
Speaker 3:  because we wouldn't sell them chips. There's like a whole thing that happened

1063
00:56:45,765 --> 00:56:46,405
Speaker 3:  with world. They'd

1064
00:56:46,405 --> 00:56:47,525
Speaker 4:  Make their own operating system.

1065
00:56:47,825 --> 00:56:51,325
Speaker 3:  It start all over and now they're like three screens and

1066
00:56:51,725 --> 00:56:55,645
Speaker 3:  everyone's kinda like, what if, what if we let Huawei back in the United States?

1067
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:56,125
Speaker 3:  I

1068
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:59,645
Speaker 4:  I, yeah, I I want this the world's first jewel folding

1069
00:57:00,065 --> 00:57:00,805
Speaker 4:  triple screen.

1070
00:57:01,065 --> 00:57:03,125
Speaker 3:  So it's the mate xt it is

1071
00:57:03,805 --> 00:57:04,845
Speaker 4:  Ultimate Design, please. It's

1072
00:57:04,845 --> 00:57:07,245
Speaker 3:  Called the Mate XT Ultimate Design. They announced it on the same day as

1073
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:11,085
Speaker 3:  the iPhone, which is very good. It's very

1074
00:57:11,085 --> 00:57:15,005
Speaker 3:  expensive. It's $2,800 thereabout depending on the conversion factor

1075
00:57:15,105 --> 00:57:17,925
Speaker 3:  to go on. That's two 50 gigs of storage.

1076
00:57:18,965 --> 00:57:22,645
Speaker 3:  Our story points out that's $300 more than a 16 inch MacBook Pro. How many

1077
00:57:22,645 --> 00:57:26,285
Speaker 3:  times can I fold up my 16 inch MacBook, Pro, Eli? All of the videos, all

1078
00:57:26,285 --> 00:57:30,005
Speaker 3:  the assets, all the content that s released is just the thing unfolding and

1079
00:57:30,035 --> 00:57:32,445
Speaker 3:  showing people looking at presentations.

1080
00:57:33,045 --> 00:57:34,565
Speaker 4:  Somebody got a hands-on with it though. Somebody has

1081
00:57:34,565 --> 00:57:34,885
Speaker 3:  A hands-on.

1082
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:38,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah, so Gizmo China got a hands-on with it and, and put in a

1083
00:57:38,805 --> 00:57:42,325
Speaker 4:  couple of additional specs. It's only a little thicker than the Samsung

1084
00:57:42,705 --> 00:57:46,685
Speaker 4:  Galaxy Z fold. And it looks like, like you

1085
00:57:46,685 --> 00:57:49,845
Speaker 4:  can watch this video, it's, we'll put it in the show notes. It looks

1086
00:57:50,695 --> 00:57:53,565
Speaker 4:  thick. The camera is huge.

1087
00:57:54,795 --> 00:57:56,445
Speaker 3:  Yeah, that is a big camera bone.

1088
00:57:56,505 --> 00:57:57,845
Speaker 4:  The, that's a big boy.

1089
00:57:58,305 --> 00:58:01,645
Speaker 3:  Oh, there are more. I'm looking now on YouTube. There are more Chinese

1090
00:58:02,415 --> 00:58:05,605
Speaker 3:  hands ons with this thing that are, are starting to trickle out, but they're

1091
00:58:05,605 --> 00:58:09,205
Speaker 3:  all just the thing unfolding. Yeah. That's the only content that exists

1092
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:13,245
Speaker 3:  is a very controlled demo of a thing unfolding. What else do you need to

1093
00:58:13,245 --> 00:58:15,405
Speaker 3:  know? That's, that's, that's the whole

1094
00:58:15,465 --> 00:58:16,685
Speaker 4:  Job. Well here's I

1095
00:58:16,835 --> 00:58:19,765
Speaker 3:  Well does the operating system do anything when you turn it into a sheet

1096
00:58:19,765 --> 00:58:20,125
Speaker 3:  of paper?

1097
00:58:22,745 --> 00:58:25,285
Speaker 4:  We need to see before and after. We don't, don't worry about the, the, the

1098
00:58:25,285 --> 00:58:25,485
Speaker 4:  process.

1099
00:58:26,225 --> 00:58:29,765
Speaker 3:  So one of the things that I am very curious about in this next turn of phones,

1100
00:58:31,135 --> 00:58:34,685
Speaker 3:  we've been talking a lot about pixel fold seems to be very popular amongst

1101
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:38,445
Speaker 3:  the gadget population. Whether it's going to move Google's market share

1102
00:58:38,545 --> 00:58:42,405
Speaker 3:  at all, it won't. But if you're a particular kind of gadget nerd,

1103
00:58:42,545 --> 00:58:46,085
Speaker 3:  it is the device that everyone's like talking about it into lately. Which

1104
00:58:46,085 --> 00:58:50,045
Speaker 3:  is interesting. It feels like folding phones that

1105
00:58:50,545 --> 00:58:54,235
Speaker 3:  bifold, they've reached a point where

1106
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:57,915
Speaker 3:  now they're just maturing in iterative steps. Yeah. Right. Compared to the

1107
00:58:57,915 --> 00:58:59,435
Speaker 3:  where the galaxy fold started, which

1108
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,115
Speaker 4:  Means Apple will have one next year, which

1109
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:04,715
Speaker 3:  Maybe yeah, pixel fold still you can still feel the same. It's not perfect,

1110
00:59:04,895 --> 00:59:07,435
Speaker 3:  but it's, it's right in a way you can see the

1111
00:59:07,435 --> 00:59:09,355
Speaker 4:  Little crease when you open it still. Yeah.

1112
00:59:10,415 --> 00:59:13,555
Speaker 3:  And you can, you can definitely feel it with your finger, but it's like,

1113
00:59:13,555 --> 00:59:17,365
Speaker 3:  it's hit that point. And so now are we just at Okay,

1114
00:59:17,385 --> 00:59:18,605
Speaker 3:  add another one. Yeah.

1115
00:59:20,585 --> 00:59:23,265
Speaker 3:  Do we think think I mean like I under like the Chinese fund market and the

1116
00:59:23,265 --> 00:59:26,865
Speaker 3:  Indian fund market are like full of these ideas. Like Yeah. Do

1117
00:59:26,935 --> 00:59:30,665
Speaker 3:  bonkers hardware stuff and see what happens. Markets around the

1118
00:59:30,665 --> 00:59:34,025
Speaker 3:  world are generally more open to

1119
00:59:34,175 --> 00:59:37,985
Speaker 3:  weirdness just because of the way our carriers are. And Apple's

1120
00:59:37,985 --> 00:59:41,705
Speaker 3:  iMessage domination, they're all a bunch of stuff. That means we don't get

1121
00:59:41,705 --> 00:59:42,385
Speaker 3:  cool phones first.

1122
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:47,185
Speaker 4:  Oh no, he's, he, this one video has the guy actually folding it

1123
00:59:47,445 --> 00:59:51,265
Speaker 4:  and then you watch it all like realign itself. Yeah, it looks cool.

1124
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:54,225
Speaker 3:  I mean, Huawei did have to build their own operating system because again,

1125
00:59:54,365 --> 00:59:57,225
Speaker 3:  we, the amount of sanctions the United States government put on Huawei just

1126
00:59:57,225 --> 00:59:59,665
Speaker 3:  changed the direction of that company. That's fine.

1127
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:04,545
Speaker 3:  But it just seems like this is a, a weird, you look at this, you look at

1128
01:00:04,545 --> 01:00:07,745
Speaker 3:  how people are excited about it in a way that the first set of foldables

1129
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:10,945
Speaker 3:  didn't really capture, but now maybe the technology is mature enough.

1130
01:00:11,245 --> 01:00:14,105
Speaker 4:  See, I I think there's like, also, there's a weird cultural element here

1131
01:00:14,105 --> 01:00:17,345
Speaker 4:  too, because we're seeing all of these things happening in other countries

1132
01:00:17,345 --> 01:00:21,145
Speaker 4:  in the United States is so focused on the iPhone and the iPhone is so stuck

1133
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:24,465
Speaker 4:  in, in, in class slab

1134
01:00:25,845 --> 01:00:29,425
Speaker 4:  and, and like Google, it's really nice that Google's coming in, but Huawei's

1135
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,785
Speaker 4:  been doing this for a while. A lot of the Xmi Hass been doing this. A lot

1136
01:00:31,785 --> 01:00:34,185
Speaker 4:  of these other country companies have been doing

1137
01:00:35,445 --> 01:00:39,385
Speaker 4:  really, really cool stuff with phones that just don't come to the

1138
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:42,905
Speaker 4:  United States In many ways it's, it's less like they're doing weird stuff.

1139
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:44,705
Speaker 4:  It's more like we're getting a little left behind.

1140
01:00:46,005 --> 01:00:49,935
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean again, it's so hard to break into us smartphone market

1141
01:00:49,935 --> 01:00:53,855
Speaker 3:  because of the essential duopoly of Apple and Samsung, but the

1142
01:00:53,855 --> 01:00:55,575
Speaker 3:  carriers have more or less en enforced.

1143
01:00:57,345 --> 01:01:00,455
Speaker 3:  Would you? So it goes, I I've talked, we've talked about this so many times.

1144
01:01:00,565 --> 01:01:03,935
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But I'm just wondering from a hardware perspective, do we think the

1145
01:01:03,935 --> 01:01:07,895
Speaker 3:  regular folding phones have reached their sort of like, yeah, we're done

1146
01:01:07,895 --> 01:01:10,895
Speaker 3:  with this. We we don't need to figure out any basics here now we're just

1147
01:01:10,895 --> 01:01:11,375
Speaker 3:  about Well, because

1148
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:15,295
Speaker 4:  I think a lot people are are the folks are comfortable with that,

1149
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:18,215
Speaker 4:  that little crease. It, it doesn't seem to bother people that much and they

1150
01:01:18,215 --> 01:01:20,775
Speaker 4:  figured out the front of the phone. Right. Like, like with the Pixel Pro,

1151
01:01:20,775 --> 01:01:23,375
Speaker 4:  that was the thing everybody really likes about it, is that they figured

1152
01:01:23,395 --> 01:01:26,815
Speaker 4:  out the front. So you can just use the phone as normal. You never even have

1153
01:01:26,815 --> 01:01:29,295
Speaker 4:  to open it up. But then when you do wanna like have a good time,

1154
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:30,785
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1155
01:01:30,965 --> 01:01:32,425
Speaker 4:  You open it up and enjoy yourself.

1156
01:01:33,225 --> 01:01:35,145
Speaker 3:  I don't open up David. David you have long,

1157
01:01:35,215 --> 01:01:35,825
Speaker 4:  Take me outta this.

1158
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:39,825
Speaker 3:  You have long insisted that it'll be the, the the

1159
01:01:39,825 --> 01:01:40,425
Speaker 3:  flip style.

1160
01:01:40,775 --> 01:01:41,185
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I

1161
01:01:41,535 --> 01:01:44,025
Speaker 3:  Does seeing a triple fold change your mind? It should.

1162
01:01:44,365 --> 01:01:47,505
Speaker 5:  No, I think, I think the triple fold

1163
01:01:48,485 --> 01:01:52,465
Speaker 5:  is an interesting tablet replacement way more than it

1164
01:01:52,465 --> 01:01:56,425
Speaker 5:  is a, an interesting phone replacement. Like I think phone

1165
01:01:56,425 --> 01:01:59,625
Speaker 5:  that turns into smartwatch is a way more compelling thing to most people

1166
01:01:59,895 --> 01:02:03,865
Speaker 5:  than tablet that turns into phone. And but to

1167
01:02:03,865 --> 01:02:07,345
Speaker 5:  your point about the hardware, like on one level we are

1168
01:02:07,535 --> 01:02:10,905
Speaker 5:  getting there. Like this stuff is pretty good. There's work left to do.

1169
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:15,145
Speaker 5:  They need to get more rugged, the cameras need to get better, the

1170
01:02:15,215 --> 01:02:18,945
Speaker 5:  screens need to continue to improve. The, the whole thing needs to get

1171
01:02:19,045 --> 01:02:22,965
Speaker 5:  thinner and lighter. Like these phones are big, they're big and

1172
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:27,085
Speaker 5:  there, there's just, there's a lot of work left to do. But in terms of like,

1173
01:02:27,385 --> 01:02:31,125
Speaker 5:  can you make a phone that kind of works open and closed?

1174
01:02:31,195 --> 01:02:33,965
Speaker 5:  Like the, the answer to that is yes. Right. And I think we've, we've landed

1175
01:02:34,025 --> 01:02:37,965
Speaker 5:  on, especially with this last generation, Samsung has

1176
01:02:37,965 --> 01:02:40,725
Speaker 5:  gotten closer to the right size. OnePlus is getting closer to the right size.

1177
01:02:40,725 --> 01:02:43,125
Speaker 5:  Google is seemingly very close to the right size.

1178
01:02:45,205 --> 01:02:48,405
Speaker 5:  I I think what you're seeing from a lot of these companies and Huawei and

1179
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:52,565
Speaker 5:  Xmi and others have done this for years is like unbelievably cool.

1180
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:56,325
Speaker 5:  Really high-end tech demos that like, they don't think a lot of people are

1181
01:02:56,325 --> 01:03:00,245
Speaker 5:  gonna buy this phone. But it, it gets people excited. It's like, it's

1182
01:03:00,245 --> 01:03:04,165
Speaker 5:  a branding exercise as much as it is like an actual phone to

1183
01:03:04,165 --> 01:03:04,885
Speaker 5:  sell to humans.

1184
01:03:05,405 --> 01:03:08,725
Speaker 4:  I, I disagree. It's so cool looking.

1185
01:03:08,905 --> 01:03:10,165
Speaker 3:  It is 2,800 all it's

1186
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:13,445
Speaker 4:  2,800 look you put on like a what about it makes you, its what

1187
01:03:13,445 --> 01:03:14,925
Speaker 5:  Not the whole point is that it's cool looking.

1188
01:03:15,275 --> 01:03:18,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. A 10 year plan paying like $30

1189
01:03:19,165 --> 01:03:20,645
Speaker 4:  a month, this would be great.

1190
01:03:21,025 --> 01:03:23,765
Speaker 5:  Didn't you just complain about the PS five Pros cost,

1191
01:03:25,465 --> 01:03:28,725
Speaker 4:  If it could fold just on folded like an accordion, I would I take it all

1192
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:32,605
Speaker 4:  back if it was like big GPU but also folded like this. Yeah. Yeah.

1193
01:03:32,705 --> 01:03:34,605
Speaker 4:  You put the motion in I'm, I'm sold.

1194
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:38,685
Speaker 5:  No, I I do think we're, we're gonna hit a point where people start doing

1195
01:03:38,685 --> 01:03:42,645
Speaker 5:  even weirder stuff with this, but also like there's a,

1196
01:03:42,645 --> 01:03:46,405
Speaker 5:  there's a thing that's coming that is a lot of

1197
01:03:46,705 --> 01:03:50,125
Speaker 5:  new wacky experimenting in phone hardware

1198
01:03:50,505 --> 01:03:54,325
Speaker 5:  and I'm very excited about it. Like, it, it got stagnant for so

1199
01:03:54,325 --> 01:03:58,085
Speaker 5:  long and then a couple of people tried folding phones and it didn't really

1200
01:03:58,085 --> 01:04:01,365
Speaker 5:  work. And I think everybody decided maybe this isn't gonna be the thing and

1201
01:04:01,365 --> 01:04:05,205
Speaker 5:  now it feels like it might be the thing. And I think like nothing

1202
01:04:05,225 --> 01:04:09,165
Speaker 5:  is gonna beat the candy bar phone anytime soon if ever. But the

1203
01:04:09,165 --> 01:04:12,885
Speaker 5:  like the, the experimentation is coming back and I think that's awesome.

1204
01:04:13,035 --> 01:04:13,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

1205
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:17,605
Speaker 3:  I mean the iPhone 16 Pro Max is all 6.9

1206
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:21,165
Speaker 3:  inches Almo almost seven. It's, we're starting to strain the

1207
01:04:21,165 --> 01:04:22,765
Speaker 3:  boundaries of how big a phone can be before

1208
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,365
Speaker 4:  Has to fold. I wanna accordion that immediately.

1209
01:04:25,645 --> 01:04:28,205
Speaker 3:  I haven't f you know, the first thing I did in the hands on air, just fold

1210
01:04:28,205 --> 01:04:32,045
Speaker 3:  one that list of things you said about what, what folding phones need to

1211
01:04:32,045 --> 01:04:34,685
Speaker 3:  get better. They need to be more durable. The screens need to be better.

1212
01:04:35,185 --> 01:04:38,405
Speaker 3:  That's sa the same list of qualities that you could have applied to the first

1213
01:04:38,425 --> 01:04:42,405
Speaker 3:  iPhone. Oh, for sure. Right. And so it's just, they're on the same path.

1214
01:04:42,735 --> 01:04:45,965
Speaker 3:  Right. That and that's what I mean, like we figured out the, the core technology

1215
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:49,765
Speaker 3:  and now we're just iteratively improving like around the edges to get them

1216
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:53,445
Speaker 3:  even better. That feels like a moment. I'm not sure where that moment's gonna

1217
01:04:53,445 --> 01:04:57,045
Speaker 3:  lead to the fact that we're like, screw it, two, two screens fold out.

1218
01:04:57,515 --> 01:05:00,765
Speaker 3:  Kind of feels like maybe they figured out how to get one screen to, to fold

1219
01:05:00,765 --> 01:05:03,045
Speaker 3:  out and that now we're just seeing what else we can do.

1220
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:05,165
Speaker 4:  I'm put another fold in.

1221
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:08,285
Speaker 3:  I'm just, I am dying for the three screen phone.

1222
01:05:08,755 --> 01:05:12,605
Speaker 5:  It's so dumb. Well just, just think about the difference in how the

1223
01:05:12,605 --> 01:05:16,565
Speaker 5:  screen looks and feels from the first Z fold

1224
01:05:17,225 --> 01:05:20,925
Speaker 5:  to now. Right. Like just the sheer amount of like material science

1225
01:05:20,925 --> 01:05:24,525
Speaker 5:  improvements that have been made to get to this point is crazy.

1226
01:05:24,895 --> 01:05:28,805
Speaker 5:  Those things were like plastic and was it, it was Dieter

1227
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:31,565
Speaker 5:  right? Who like accidentally peeled part of the screen off thinking it was

1228
01:05:31,565 --> 01:05:33,965
Speaker 5:  a screen protector. Like that was not that long ago. No,

1229
01:05:33,965 --> 01:05:37,765
Speaker 3:  No. Dieter had a tiny amount of dust in his review unit that broke the screen.

1230
01:05:38,105 --> 01:05:40,485
Speaker 3:  Oh, that's right. And then somebody else peeled off the screen protector.

1231
01:05:40,485 --> 01:05:43,205
Speaker 3:  Okay. Okay. And then Samsung delayed the launch of the first

1232
01:05:43,245 --> 01:05:45,925
Speaker 5:  C. Right. That was not a long time ago. And now

1233
01:05:46,395 --> 01:05:46,685
Speaker 3:  Four

1234
01:05:46,685 --> 01:05:50,285
Speaker 5:  Years ago. Yeah, like that at the, the speed with which that stuff, and that

1235
01:05:50,285 --> 01:05:53,085
Speaker 5:  was always the gating factor, right? Like the question was not how do you

1236
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:56,805
Speaker 5:  build a good hinge? It was can you make a screen that

1237
01:05:56,975 --> 01:06:00,885
Speaker 5:  works like this and works means a lot of things. But I think the answer to

1238
01:06:00,885 --> 01:06:04,565
Speaker 5:  that is like, yes. And we're almost there. And So I think you're right that

1239
01:06:04,565 --> 01:06:08,045
Speaker 5:  like the path now is way more about software and it's way more about use

1240
01:06:08,045 --> 01:06:11,885
Speaker 5:  cases and it's way more about details. And again, it's way

1241
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:15,725
Speaker 5:  more about do people actually want this? Which also is can you make

1242
01:06:15,725 --> 01:06:19,605
Speaker 5:  this thing for $800 and not $1,800? Yeah. And those are like, those

1243
01:06:19,605 --> 01:06:23,445
Speaker 5:  are big hills to climb. But they are, I think like, I don't know,

1244
01:06:23,505 --> 01:06:27,045
Speaker 5:  to just ruin the analogy. They're like hills. You can see the top of, whereas

1245
01:06:27,165 --> 01:06:31,045
Speaker 5:  I think not that many years ago, like can we make this screen not fall apart

1246
01:06:31,305 --> 01:06:34,285
Speaker 5:  was genuinely I think kind of up in the air. Yeah. And

1247
01:06:34,285 --> 01:06:35,925
Speaker 4:  Now you can just do a little accordion,

1248
01:06:36,315 --> 01:06:39,045
Speaker 3:  Just boop boop. You just walk up to any phone you see and fold it in half

1249
01:06:39,045 --> 01:06:39,205
Speaker 3:  and see,

1250
01:06:39,235 --> 01:06:42,285
Speaker 5:  Dude, I'm telling you there's one shot in this Huawei video where it's open

1251
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:45,965
Speaker 5:  on, it's open on two, so it just looks like a normal foldable phone. And

1252
01:06:45,965 --> 01:06:49,525
Speaker 5:  then he just kinda reaches below and pulls up the third part and the the

1253
01:06:49,665 --> 01:06:53,525
Speaker 5:  UI just gloriously expands. Yeah. I've I've watched that like 25 times

1254
01:06:53,535 --> 01:06:55,485
Speaker 5:  since we've been sitting here talking. It's awesome.

1255
01:06:56,195 --> 01:06:59,845
Speaker 3:  It's sick. It's coming. I'm telling you it, it got more attention from a

1256
01:06:59,845 --> 01:07:02,845
Speaker 3:  certain audience on iPhone day than the iPhone. Yeah.

1257
01:07:03,555 --> 01:07:07,245
Speaker 3:  There's something to that. All right. I wanna end by putting two Google stories

1258
01:07:07,925 --> 01:07:11,445
Speaker 3:  together right next to each other. 'cause I think they're kind of really

1259
01:07:11,685 --> 01:07:13,565
Speaker 3:  interesting when you put 'em right next to each other. We've actually talked

1260
01:07:13,605 --> 01:07:17,565
Speaker 3:  a lot about Google on this episode. They, they seem in one

1261
01:07:17,565 --> 01:07:21,525
Speaker 3:  way to have a bunch of confidence. And maybe that confidence is just

1262
01:07:21,525 --> 01:07:24,805
Speaker 3:  like, we have to put Gemini in front of you. So here it is.

1263
01:07:25,385 --> 01:07:28,685
Speaker 3:  But we reviewed the Pixel Watch three this week. V reviewed it. She gave

1264
01:07:28,685 --> 01:07:32,485
Speaker 3:  it an eight. People like it like Yeah, people really

1265
01:07:32,485 --> 01:07:36,445
Speaker 3:  like this watch. It is a confident product. The integrations

1266
01:07:36,445 --> 01:07:40,365
Speaker 3:  across the sort of Pixel and Google ecosystem are solid. We've been talking

1267
01:07:40,405 --> 01:07:44,195
Speaker 3:  a lot about the pixel nines for all of their, you know, general

1268
01:07:44,195 --> 01:07:47,515
Speaker 3:  issues with swerving reality into chaos because of their,

1269
01:07:47,885 --> 01:07:51,675
Speaker 3:  their just absolute nihilism about AI image editing. But they're good phones

1270
01:07:51,675 --> 01:07:55,515
Speaker 3:  that people like. Yeah. And the Pixel Watch three is a

1271
01:07:55,515 --> 01:07:58,435
Speaker 3:  good watch that V really likes. And I think people who buy into the ecosystem

1272
01:07:58,435 --> 01:08:01,355
Speaker 3:  aren't gonna like it. There's something happening on that side of the house

1273
01:08:01,355 --> 01:08:04,715
Speaker 3:  for Google. Yeah. Where they've fallen into a groove. The hardware is good.

1274
01:08:05,305 --> 01:08:09,245
Speaker 3:  There's a thesis in the software. Even if the, every

1275
01:08:09,245 --> 01:08:12,285
Speaker 3:  time you pick up pixel phone, it's just like Gemini. Like there's still a

1276
01:08:12,285 --> 01:08:15,845
Speaker 3:  thesis. There's there's a point of view, which I think is very strong. They

1277
01:08:15,845 --> 01:08:19,645
Speaker 3:  haven't had a point of view for quite a while. That's, that's that house

1278
01:08:19,825 --> 01:08:23,645
Speaker 3:  on the other side of the house. Well their search engine just got rules

1279
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:27,645
Speaker 3:  via Monopoly. And they are on trial again right

1280
01:08:27,665 --> 01:08:31,485
Speaker 3:  now for antitrust for their ad tech stack.

1281
01:08:32,185 --> 01:08:35,845
Speaker 3:  And the, you know, there's trial, it's

1282
01:08:36,005 --> 01:08:38,965
Speaker 3:  witnesses, there's documents, Lauren fine's in the courthouse covering it

1283
01:08:38,965 --> 01:08:42,525
Speaker 3:  for us. It's all very boring. It's a bunch of suits talking about display

1284
01:08:42,525 --> 01:08:46,025
Speaker 3:  ads on the web. Like If, you want to go to sleep. Programmatic

1285
01:08:46,305 --> 01:08:49,945
Speaker 3:  advertising is the thing to talk about. But what's fascinating is one

1286
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:53,985
Speaker 3:  in all the documents, all witnesses, the way Google's business people

1287
01:08:53,985 --> 01:08:57,745
Speaker 3:  talk about its business is ice cold. Oh yeah. Right. Yeah. There's no Google

1288
01:08:57,965 --> 01:09:01,785
Speaker 3:  cuddle bugs there. No. At all. It is literally

1289
01:09:01,785 --> 01:09:05,705
Speaker 3:  how do we own this market? Here's the value. The value is, there's a line

1290
01:09:05,705 --> 01:09:07,625
Speaker 3:  in one of the emails. It's like the value here is that we own everything.

1291
01:09:08,335 --> 01:09:11,705
Speaker 3:  Like that's, that's the thing that makes this powerful is we own every part

1292
01:09:11,705 --> 01:09:15,585
Speaker 3:  of the stack. And so that they're just saying it out loud and then you

1293
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:18,585
Speaker 3:  have the clients, the actual people buying advertising, being like, Google's

1294
01:09:18,585 --> 01:09:22,065
Speaker 3:  technology here is bad. We're just stuck with it. Right? Yeah. And like the

1295
01:09:22,065 --> 01:09:24,865
Speaker 3:  core ad tech server that Google's been using to serve all the programmatic

1296
01:09:24,865 --> 01:09:28,185
Speaker 3:  ads all over the web, they're like, this is bad. Like this is like 20-year-old

1297
01:09:28,185 --> 01:09:30,185
Speaker 3:  technology that we would like to get away from, but we're stuck with it.

1298
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:33,785
Speaker 3:  'cause there's nowhere to go. And that is a weird dynamic for Google.

1299
01:09:34,585 --> 01:09:38,375
Speaker 3:  Right? On the one hand, they, with the AI stuff with

1300
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:40,895
Speaker 3:  Gemini, maybe they got, you know, caught on the back foot,

1301
01:09:42,255 --> 01:09:46,075
Speaker 3:  but they, it provided some amount of focus for the company it seems like,

1302
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:50,805
Speaker 3:  and it's reflected in these Pixel devices. I I think

1303
01:09:50,805 --> 01:09:54,765
Speaker 3:  you can see it like there's, there's a reason for them to be the

1304
01:09:54,765 --> 01:09:58,725
Speaker 3:  way they are. Yeah. Which is really interesting. Like, I don't know,

1305
01:09:59,005 --> 01:10:02,845
Speaker 3:  I if not for chat GBT would the Pixel nine have been, had this much

1306
01:10:02,845 --> 01:10:06,005
Speaker 3:  focus, like, I don't know the answer to that question. Like they weren't

1307
01:10:06,005 --> 01:10:09,885
Speaker 3:  on this path all by themselves. Right? Like it took this weird sort of diversion

1308
01:10:09,885 --> 01:10:13,565
Speaker 3:  from open AI to, to bring them here, but they, it worked. And then on the

1309
01:10:13,565 --> 01:10:17,165
Speaker 3:  other side of the house, the money people are like, this is a monopoly. We

1310
01:10:17,165 --> 01:10:21,005
Speaker 3:  don't like using this technology. And it feels based on

1311
01:10:21,005 --> 01:10:24,805
Speaker 3:  what happened in the search trial. Like the government knows how to beat

1312
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:28,585
Speaker 3:  Google. This is the case. I would remind everybody that

1313
01:10:28,585 --> 01:10:32,505
Speaker 3:  Google tried to avoid in jury trial by just sending

1314
01:10:32,705 --> 01:10:36,185
Speaker 3:  a check to the United States government for what it calculated to be the

1315
01:10:36,185 --> 01:10:39,865
Speaker 3:  maximum amount of damages. Yeah. Like on Wells Fargo account, they're just

1316
01:10:39,865 --> 01:10:42,305
Speaker 3:  like, here's some millions of dollars. Is this good?

1317
01:10:44,915 --> 01:10:47,575
Speaker 3:  We, well we, we will put it in the show note. There's a picture of the check.

1318
01:10:47,575 --> 01:10:51,455
Speaker 3:  You can just look at the check. Google sent a check. That's how Monopoly

1319
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:55,415
Speaker 3:  works. Right? Here you go. Like literally how Monopoly works. Like they were

1320
01:10:55,555 --> 01:10:59,175
Speaker 3:  so desperate for this not to be happening that they just wrote the, they

1321
01:10:59,175 --> 01:11:00,895
Speaker 3:  just fronted the money for a settlement.

1322
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:06,255
Speaker 3:  And So, I just, I would just juxtapose those two things. I think it's, you

1323
01:11:06,255 --> 01:11:09,815
Speaker 3:  see this company it kind of like at war with itself a little bit.

1324
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:14,285
Speaker 3:  'cause the thing that is funding everything is at all of this risk

1325
01:11:14,905 --> 01:11:17,485
Speaker 3:  and the future is like coming into focus over here.

1326
01:11:18,105 --> 01:11:22,005
Speaker 5:  Except that in so many ways, so far, all of Google's future stuff

1327
01:11:22,005 --> 01:11:25,325
Speaker 5:  has just been ancillary to the other thing. Right? Like Right. I think the,

1328
01:11:25,385 --> 01:11:28,365
Speaker 5:  the most damning critique you could make of everything Google has done in

1329
01:11:28,365 --> 01:11:31,445
Speaker 5:  25 years is that it actually doesn't care about anything but search. And

1330
01:11:31,445 --> 01:11:35,285
Speaker 5:  so everything gets subjugated to the needs of search. Like

1331
01:11:35,305 --> 01:11:37,405
Speaker 5:  the people who build Chrome will tell you they could have built a better

1332
01:11:37,405 --> 01:11:40,405
Speaker 5:  browser except that what they had to do is optimize for search queries, which

1333
01:11:40,405 --> 01:11:43,845
Speaker 5:  is a weird thing to have to optimize for in a web browser. And so like, and

1334
01:11:43,845 --> 01:11:46,405
Speaker 5:  this is a story you hear over and over from Google is everything eventually

1335
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:50,365
Speaker 5:  loses at the hand of the search team. And I, I think you could make

1336
01:11:50,365 --> 01:11:53,565
Speaker 5:  the case that the only team as powerful at Google as the people who make

1337
01:11:53,565 --> 01:11:57,405
Speaker 5:  the search engine are the people who make the ads. And like that that is

1338
01:11:58,345 --> 01:12:02,325
Speaker 5:  who is now being thrown into this fight. And the, to your point, like

1339
01:12:02,325 --> 01:12:06,005
Speaker 5:  the, the thing we say a lot on this show is that what happens at one trial

1340
01:12:06,025 --> 01:12:08,965
Speaker 5:  has very little to do with what happens at the next trial. And I think that's

1341
01:12:09,085 --> 01:12:12,085
Speaker 5:  probably true in Google's case here too. Like all this stuff is still very

1342
01:12:12,085 --> 01:12:15,845
Speaker 5:  up in the air. But the thing we heard over and over in the last

1343
01:12:15,935 --> 01:12:19,445
Speaker 5:  trial was Google's argument was

1344
01:12:19,825 --> 01:12:23,525
Speaker 5:  Google is very good, which is why we keep winning. And it's very hard to

1345
01:12:23,525 --> 01:12:27,085
Speaker 5:  argue that there are better products out there than Google. And yet Google

1346
01:12:27,295 --> 01:12:31,005
Speaker 5:  still lost because, because the, the argument came up over and over that

1347
01:12:31,165 --> 01:12:34,405
Speaker 5:  actually what Google is doing is preventing that from happening. Right. That

1348
01:12:34,405 --> 01:12:37,405
Speaker 5:  like, maybe the reason there isn't more competition for Google is because

1349
01:12:37,405 --> 01:12:40,765
Speaker 5:  Google has not allowed it. And, and Amit Meta, the judge was very receptive

1350
01:12:40,765 --> 01:12:44,525
Speaker 5:  to that argument. This one in which the overwhelming thing

1351
01:12:44,525 --> 01:12:48,085
Speaker 5:  seems to be actually this sucks and there's nothing anybody can do about

1352
01:12:48,085 --> 01:12:51,965
Speaker 5:  it. It's like even the way Lauren was covering in the first couple of

1353
01:12:51,965 --> 01:12:55,925
Speaker 5:  days, you, you get the sense that the people accusing Google of being monopolists

1354
01:12:56,465 --> 01:13:00,325
Speaker 5:  are very confident coming into this. And how, how that means it'll go,

1355
01:13:00,465 --> 01:13:04,245
Speaker 5:  who knows? But there there is a real sense of like, the argument

1356
01:13:04,365 --> 01:13:08,245
Speaker 5:  is extremely strong in this particular case. And it's, it's gonna come

1357
01:13:08,245 --> 01:13:11,645
Speaker 5:  down to market definitions as it always does. And it's gonna get deeply

1358
01:13:12,095 --> 01:13:16,045
Speaker 5:  wonky. And I'm going to court at least once next week and I could not be

1359
01:13:16,045 --> 01:13:19,685
Speaker 5:  more excited to listen to people yell at me about ad stacks for for

1360
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:23,645
Speaker 5:  weeks. But, but yeah, it is like Google is is both kind of

1361
01:13:23,645 --> 01:13:26,325
Speaker 5:  feeling itself and fighting for its life, like all at the same time. And

1362
01:13:26,325 --> 01:13:27,325
Speaker 5:  it's, it's very odd.

1363
01:13:27,565 --> 01:13:31,325
Speaker 3:  I feel like I, I need to disclose here. We we have

1364
01:13:31,345 --> 01:13:35,235
Speaker 3:  ads on our website. What? That we have That's

1365
01:13:35,235 --> 01:13:39,155
Speaker 3:  true. Oh my God. And Vox Media's president of Revenue

1366
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:42,195
Speaker 3:  and Growth. Ryan Polly is on the list of potential witnesses in this trial.

1367
01:13:44,145 --> 01:13:47,355
Speaker 3:  Well, I haven't talked to him about it. I dunno if he's gonna get Hal, he's

1368
01:13:47,355 --> 01:13:51,155
Speaker 3:  just on the list. 'cause we run a, we run a programmatic

1369
01:13:51,215 --> 01:13:53,955
Speaker 3:  ad network called Concert theoretically competes with Google.

1370
01:13:55,215 --> 01:13:58,895
Speaker 3:  That's not truly not our side of the house. Like it's all the way over there.

1371
01:13:59,055 --> 01:14:01,935
Speaker 3:  I love that Ryan has great hair. I will say that that's the one thing I know

1372
01:14:01,935 --> 01:14:05,775
Speaker 3:  about. He does great hair. But like this thing where you

1373
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:09,095
Speaker 3:  say like, you're a anybody listening, pull over in your car and think about

1374
01:14:09,095 --> 01:14:12,565
Speaker 3:  the internet. That's my instruction to, to you do, do you like the ads that

1375
01:14:12,565 --> 01:14:16,285
Speaker 3:  you're seeing? There's a million companies, a million

1376
01:14:16,425 --> 01:14:19,445
Speaker 3:  ad tech companies that are like, we can make better ads. And all of them

1377
01:14:19,445 --> 01:14:23,005
Speaker 3:  are like, and then you run into the monster and you, you give up. Yep.

1378
01:14:23,285 --> 01:14:26,005
Speaker 3:  Most of those people flip the ad tech companies or they try to bundle 'em

1379
01:14:26,005 --> 01:14:29,005
Speaker 3:  up to create a new monster and they get rich and then they, you know, live

1380
01:14:29,085 --> 01:14:32,525
Speaker 3:  a healthy life on LinkedIn complaining about the monster. Like, like they're

1381
01:14:32,525 --> 01:14:35,525
Speaker 3:  well practiced at this. It's, it is not like they're available to you.

1382
01:14:36,425 --> 01:14:39,725
Speaker 3:  The reporting is easy to do, it's just kind of what you're really trying

1383
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:42,405
Speaker 3:  to sell an audience. Even what I'm trying to sell to you right now listening

1384
01:14:42,425 --> 01:14:46,275
Speaker 3:  is like, there's a reason ads on the internet are bad and it's because

1385
01:14:46,735 --> 01:14:50,195
Speaker 3:  no one, the market is not actually competitive for better ad experiences.

1386
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:54,035
Speaker 4:  Okay. But which is worse ads now the ad

1387
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:57,595
Speaker 4:  experience now, or like in the 1990s where

1388
01:14:57,855 --> 01:15:01,315
Speaker 4:  it would be a popup of porn that would then infect your computer.

1389
01:15:01,345 --> 01:15:04,995
Speaker 3:  Well, so in the 1990s I was a teenage boy. So you're like,

1390
01:15:05,185 --> 01:15:05,955
Speaker 3:  that rules.

1391
01:15:08,535 --> 01:15:09,595
Speaker 4:  I'm the teenage girl. I was

1392
01:15:10,925 --> 01:15:13,715
Speaker 3:  Early two thousands. Like, this is great. This is what I was here for the

1393
01:15:13,715 --> 01:15:13,915
Speaker 3:  whole time.

1394
01:15:14,495 --> 01:15:17,355
Speaker 5:  Can I just say one more thing on this before we we Yeah. Leave this subject.

1395
01:15:17,655 --> 01:15:21,035
Speaker 5:  One of the things I have been paying a lot of attention to, and I'm, I'm

1396
01:15:21,035 --> 01:15:24,435
Speaker 5:  well aware that this is like a giant generalization, but it has, it has really

1397
01:15:24,435 --> 01:15:28,115
Speaker 5:  jumped out to me in reading some of these court documents so far. Like a

1398
01:15:28,115 --> 01:15:31,875
Speaker 5:  thing you hear a lot from people in and around the tech

1399
01:15:32,115 --> 01:15:35,315
Speaker 5:  industry is that like If, you If you want to believe that in the early days

1400
01:15:35,315 --> 01:15:38,595
Speaker 5:  of the tech industry, it was like a bunch of, well-meaning hippies who just

1401
01:15:38,595 --> 01:15:41,075
Speaker 5:  like wanted to make the world a better place. And then that eventually got

1402
01:15:41,585 --> 01:15:45,475
Speaker 5:  morphed and ruined. They all blame the MBAs.

1403
01:15:46,035 --> 01:15:49,435
Speaker 5:  They're like, a bunch of people like graduated from Harvard Business School

1404
01:15:49,535 --> 01:15:51,995
Speaker 5:  and came here because they thought that's where the money was and they changed

1405
01:15:51,995 --> 01:15:55,555
Speaker 5:  the culture and they ruined everything. And like, boy does that

1406
01:15:55,705 --> 01:15:58,275
Speaker 5:  ring true when you read some of these documents, like to your point about

1407
01:15:58,275 --> 01:16:01,475
Speaker 5:  these people being ice cold, it's like, these are the MBAs, these are the

1408
01:16:01,475 --> 01:16:03,795
Speaker 5:  people who like, oh, you wanna build a cool product. I don't, I don't care.

1409
01:16:04,075 --> 01:16:05,235
Speaker 5:  That's not interesting to me. Yeah.

1410
01:16:05,235 --> 01:16:07,555
Speaker 3:  Like we're just, we are in charge of this money machine. Yeah. Like

1411
01:16:07,745 --> 01:16:08,635
Speaker 4:  Make us money. And

1412
01:16:08,635 --> 01:16:10,915
Speaker 5:  Like that is the thing that runs Silicon Valley now.

1413
01:16:11,175 --> 01:16:14,515
Speaker 3:  And it's just very hard because Google does such a good job of,

1414
01:16:15,215 --> 01:16:18,995
Speaker 3:  for the most part being like very cuddly. Like Yeah.

1415
01:16:19,115 --> 01:16:21,795
Speaker 3:  I think there's a reason Google still has one of the worst logos in world

1416
01:16:21,795 --> 01:16:25,755
Speaker 3:  history. Right. Like it's cuddly and dumb and

1417
01:16:25,755 --> 01:16:29,595
Speaker 3:  it still kind of looks like Marissa Meyer drew it herself. Right. And there's

1418
01:18:50,305 --> 01:18:54,245
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back the lightning round. I will say that there are

1419
01:18:54,245 --> 01:18:56,765
Speaker 3:  now ads on the YouTube. When you watch it on YouTube, there are some ads.

1420
01:18:56,895 --> 01:18:59,845
Speaker 3:  Those are not official sponsors of Lightning Round. The Lightning round is

1421
01:18:59,845 --> 01:19:00,925
Speaker 3:  still available to be sponsored.

1422
01:19:01,335 --> 01:19:04,365
Speaker 5:  There were so many commenters on YouTube who were happy for us that we finally

1423
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,845
Speaker 5:  sponsored the lightning round. Wanna

1424
01:19:05,865 --> 01:19:06,365
Speaker 3:  And I reject your

1425
01:19:06,365 --> 01:19:10,045
Speaker 5:  Happiness back to all of you rooting for us. But it is misplaced. Get this

1426
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:12,965
Speaker 5:  done. Yeah. Give us money and then be happy. How about that?

1427
01:19:13,605 --> 01:19:17,165
Speaker 3:  I do get emails and I, I I try to take the money, but I don't know how, because

1428
01:19:17,195 --> 01:19:21,045
Speaker 3:  it's not my job. I can be like, I take Stripe. It's just not

1429
01:19:21,045 --> 01:19:21,605
Speaker 3:  like a thing.

1430
01:19:23,735 --> 01:19:25,755
Speaker 3:  All right, let me around Krantz, what you got?

1431
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:29,795
Speaker 4:  You know how trucks are huge. I, this is actually kinda a sad one for you.

1432
01:19:29,835 --> 01:19:31,235
Speaker 4:  I do. 'cause I know you love a big

1433
01:19:31,235 --> 01:19:34,675
Speaker 3:  Truck. Every time I see a raptor now I'm like, I my baby. But

1434
01:19:34,675 --> 01:19:36,315
Speaker 4:  Sometimes trucks are too big. They're

1435
01:19:36,315 --> 01:19:37,395
Speaker 3:  All not sometimes,

1436
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:41,075
Speaker 4:  Many times the trucks are too big. If they come up to my shoulders, I'm like

1437
01:19:41,075 --> 01:19:45,035
Speaker 4:  five eight. That's, that's too tall. Yeah. The US is finally taking

1438
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:48,275
Speaker 4:  AIM and they're proposing these new rules and they were gonna use crash test

1439
01:19:48,275 --> 01:19:52,155
Speaker 4:  dummies, but instead of for Crashing, it's for pedestrians because,

1440
01:19:52,775 --> 01:19:56,155
Speaker 3:  So we're, we're gonna run the car into people like Crash Dummies. Dummies,

1441
01:19:56,155 --> 01:19:59,235
Speaker 4:  Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Just a little poop. I I think that's really nice because

1442
01:19:59,595 --> 01:20:02,875
Speaker 4:  a lot of the times now we've been seeing these really big trucks and then

1443
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:05,475
Speaker 4:  you see all of these YouTube videos and stuff of people in these really big

1444
01:20:05,475 --> 01:20:09,245
Speaker 4:  trucks and, and they can't see little kids in front of 'em and it's like

1445
01:20:09,485 --> 01:20:12,605
Speaker 4:  somebody should check that out. And apparently the government was like, we

1446
01:20:12,605 --> 01:20:13,365
Speaker 4:  should check

1447
01:20:13,365 --> 01:20:15,245
Speaker 3:  That out. And presumably the only way to

1448
01:20:15,705 --> 01:20:16,285
Speaker 4:  To do that is,

1449
01:20:16,305 --> 01:20:17,325
Speaker 3:  Is to make the truck smaller.

1450
01:20:17,845 --> 01:20:21,085
Speaker 5:  I will never be able to describe to you why I just started imagining it's,

1451
01:20:21,085 --> 01:20:24,805
Speaker 5:  it's the Beatles Abbey Road cover, but it's four crash test dummies

1452
01:20:24,855 --> 01:20:28,365
Speaker 5:  lined up like the Beatles. And then just like a cyber truck just comes

1453
01:20:29,185 --> 01:20:30,005
Speaker 5:  floors, all four

1454
01:20:30,005 --> 01:20:33,405
Speaker 3:  Of them. That's, and they're like too big. That's an AI prompt right there,

1455
01:20:33,405 --> 01:20:37,045
Speaker 3:  David. Yep. Coming soon to our runway generator near you.

1456
01:20:37,355 --> 01:20:37,645
Speaker 3:  Just

1457
01:20:37,675 --> 01:20:39,605
Speaker 5:  Immediately what popped into my head, but there

1458
01:20:39,695 --> 01:20:43,485
Speaker 4:  There is a lot of optimism about these rules. People seem to be really,

1459
01:20:43,485 --> 01:20:46,685
Speaker 4:  really excited about it. It feels like it's, it's a good first step.

1460
01:20:47,305 --> 01:20:51,125
Speaker 4:  So it's, it's, it's after all these years of just watching the trucks get

1461
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:54,125
Speaker 4:  huge, it's nice to be like, Hey, how about they don't get that tall?

1462
01:20:54,825 --> 01:20:58,685
Speaker 5:  So Nila, you're the, you're you're a truck guy. Does

1463
01:20:58,685 --> 01:21:01,685
Speaker 5:  this like, is this gonna piss off all the truck people?

1464
01:21:02,095 --> 01:21:05,085
Speaker 3:  Sorry, I just typed the Beatles Abbey Road cover, but it's Crash Test Dummies.

1465
01:21:05,155 --> 01:21:09,045
Speaker 3:  It's a rock. The, the the AI image

1466
01:21:09,045 --> 01:21:10,485
Speaker 3:  generator That's so bad.

1467
01:21:13,515 --> 01:21:16,685
Speaker 3:  This is what you get when there's literally no, I'll send it to you Dave.

1468
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:20,525
Speaker 3:  When you, when there's literally no safety standards on your AI image generator.

1469
01:21:20,525 --> 01:21:23,165
Speaker 3:  That's why I picked Crock because it it won't stop me. Their

1470
01:21:23,165 --> 01:21:23,485
Speaker 4:  Heads are

1471
01:21:23,485 --> 01:21:27,365
Speaker 3:  Cute. You were asking. Yes. I as a person who once owned a truck and still

1472
01:21:27,365 --> 01:21:30,965
Speaker 3:  thinks of my truck fondly. For example, when I use

1473
01:21:31,075 --> 01:21:34,285
Speaker 3:  Grok to generate crash test dummies as the Beatles Abby Road cover, I think

1474
01:21:34,285 --> 01:21:37,725
Speaker 3:  about moving back into the woods and driving my truck again instead of living

1475
01:21:37,725 --> 01:21:38,645
Speaker 3:  in society. What

1476
01:21:38,645 --> 01:21:42,605
Speaker 5:  I wonder is, do people buy the giant trucks because they're

1477
01:21:42,605 --> 01:21:44,925
Speaker 5:  the good trucks and people want good trucks. So if they make the good trucks

1478
01:21:45,005 --> 01:21:48,365
Speaker 5:  a little smaller, it'll be fine. Or have we gotten to a point where like,

1479
01:21:48,925 --> 01:21:52,725
Speaker 5:  I need big truck and if I if can't have big truck big mad.

1480
01:21:53,465 --> 01:21:56,405
Speaker 3:  No, I actually, two things, there's two data points

1481
01:21:57,275 --> 01:22:00,445
Speaker 3:  that kind of refute the idea that people actually want the big cars. This

1482
01:22:00,445 --> 01:22:04,325
Speaker 3:  is why. Yeah. And some people want big cars. One, the Ford Maverick is

1483
01:22:04,365 --> 01:22:08,205
Speaker 3:  a small truck that is just selling like gangbusters. Okay. It's a hit, it's

1484
01:22:08,205 --> 01:22:12,125
Speaker 3:  a hit product. And then two people are starting to import these Japanese

1485
01:22:12,245 --> 01:22:15,645
Speaker 3:  K trucks. I actually saw one at the Apple event driving down the road in

1486
01:22:15,645 --> 01:22:19,145
Speaker 3:  front of Apple Park and it was, it was like an attention magnet.

1487
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:22,105
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And then there's just these little trucks and the beds. They're still

1488
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:24,225
Speaker 3:  like five and a half foot beds. The beds are about the same size as a full

1489
01:22:24,225 --> 01:22:27,945
Speaker 3:  size truck. They're just small. Right. So they're as useful, but

1490
01:22:27,945 --> 01:22:31,625
Speaker 3:  they're just small. And I think you're seeing a bunch of interest in small

1491
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:35,345
Speaker 3:  cars again, like the market wants them. And then you look around

1492
01:22:35,645 --> 01:22:39,025
Speaker 3:  and all the cars are so gigantic, like I think pendulum just swing back and

1493
01:22:39,025 --> 01:22:42,065
Speaker 3:  forth. There's like tax stuff where you like buy a car for your small business.

1494
01:22:42,065 --> 01:22:45,545
Speaker 3:  You can write off the fold depreciation that is pushed like the Dentist of

1495
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:49,425
Speaker 3:  America buying giant SUVs that I think that stuff is coming

1496
01:22:49,445 --> 01:22:53,145
Speaker 3:  to an end or, or changing in some way. And So, I just think like

1497
01:22:53,455 --> 01:22:57,105
Speaker 3:  between a market, the regulatory pressure and then just the reality of you

1498
01:22:57,105 --> 01:23:00,225
Speaker 3:  get in a car that's so big, you need cameras to drive it.

1499
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:01,465
Speaker 4:  That's too much.

1500
01:23:01,815 --> 01:23:05,485
Speaker 3:  It's getting weird, right? Yeah. Like when the solution to

1501
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:09,165
Speaker 3:  we, you can't see children as we put cameras all around the truck that can

1502
01:23:09,165 --> 01:23:12,725
Speaker 3:  see the children for you, you're just, you're just in a weird spot.

1503
01:23:13,105 --> 01:23:16,645
Speaker 3:  So I, I think I look at like, I thoroughly enjoyed

1504
01:23:16,705 --> 01:23:20,125
Speaker 3:  owning or after it was very fun, but I lived near no one. And every time

1505
01:23:20,165 --> 01:23:24,045
Speaker 3:  I drove that thing into New York City, I encourage, if

1506
01:23:24,045 --> 01:23:27,645
Speaker 3:  If, you ever have the opportunity to drive a Ford Raptor through the West

1507
01:23:27,645 --> 01:23:31,325
Speaker 3:  Village at night during dinner time when everyone's eating outside listening

1508
01:23:31,325 --> 01:23:34,925
Speaker 3:  to the Cure with open windows, take it. That was just a weird

1509
01:23:34,925 --> 01:23:38,725
Speaker 3:  experience all the way around for everyone. Everyone was like, what is

1510
01:23:38,725 --> 01:23:42,685
Speaker 3:  happening right now? The the car is just incompatible the city. It's

1511
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:45,765
Speaker 3:  incompatible with the suburb I live in now. It's just too big, which is why

1512
01:23:45,765 --> 01:23:49,605
Speaker 3:  I got rid of it. And I just see a push, particularly like the Rivian R three.

1513
01:23:49,985 --> 01:23:53,925
Speaker 3:  That's a smallish car. Yeah. Yeah. The Ionic five, the Hyundai Ionic five.

1514
01:23:54,945 --> 01:23:58,075
Speaker 3:  It's a, it's actually big, but they designed it to look like a small car.

1515
01:23:59,155 --> 01:24:03,085
Speaker 3:  Like it's SU Vish proportions, but it's designed to look like a

1516
01:24:03,085 --> 01:24:06,125
Speaker 3:  classic hatchback. And I think people are attracted to it's selling really

1517
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:09,645
Speaker 3:  well because it feels small, even though it isn't technically as small as

1518
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:12,125
Speaker 3:  it looks. So I. Just think there's more interest in

1519
01:24:13,255 --> 01:24:17,185
Speaker 3:  smaller stuff as opposed to just like full on

1520
01:24:17,615 --> 01:24:17,905
Speaker 3:  ucon,

1521
01:24:18,445 --> 01:24:22,025
Speaker 4:  You have to f crawl into them. I was in a friend got up one of the big Ram

1522
01:24:22,025 --> 01:24:25,865
Speaker 4:  35 hundreds and I was like, hold on, do I have, do you have like a step

1523
01:24:25,925 --> 01:24:29,465
Speaker 4:  or something? How do I get into this thing? It was just nightmarish.

1524
01:24:29,905 --> 01:24:33,225
Speaker 3:  I do miss her after very much. I'm just, just saying it one more time. I

1525
01:24:33,305 --> 01:24:35,905
Speaker 3:  I I think about it all the time. The car ruled. I was

1526
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:39,145
Speaker 5:  Gonna go home, start asking Becky If. you can buy a big truck before it's

1527
01:24:39,145 --> 01:24:40,225
Speaker 5:  illegal to have a big truck.

1528
01:24:42,365 --> 01:24:46,305
Speaker 3:  No, it's fine. We have a very cranky Mustang inside. It's a good time. All

1529
01:24:46,305 --> 01:24:46,985
Speaker 3:  right, David, what you got?

1530
01:24:47,405 --> 01:24:50,625
Speaker 5:  So mine is news that actually happened like right after The Vergecast last

1531
01:24:50,625 --> 01:24:53,865
Speaker 5:  week, but I have been thinking about ever since, which is that meta

1532
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:57,825
Speaker 5:  finally sort of showed off what WhatsApp and

1533
01:24:57,825 --> 01:25:00,785
Speaker 5:  Messenger are gonna look like now that they're being forced to interoperate

1534
01:25:00,785 --> 01:25:04,065
Speaker 5:  with other chat networks. This is one of those things that has been sort

1535
01:25:04,065 --> 01:25:07,905
Speaker 5:  of burbling forever. We've known that this is gonna

1536
01:25:07,905 --> 01:25:11,665
Speaker 5:  happen because of some EU regulation that basically says any sufficiently

1537
01:25:11,665 --> 01:25:15,345
Speaker 5:  large messaging platform has to interoperate with other messaging

1538
01:25:15,425 --> 01:25:18,905
Speaker 5:  systems. But there's just a couple of screenshots that they showed off.

1539
01:25:19,325 --> 01:25:23,265
Speaker 5:  One, they look great. You're gonna be able to either have separate or

1540
01:25:23,505 --> 01:25:27,145
Speaker 5:  combined inboxes the way you can have like multiple email accounts in one

1541
01:25:27,145 --> 01:25:30,785
Speaker 5:  email client like, seems like obviously how this should work. Excited that

1542
01:25:30,785 --> 01:25:33,025
Speaker 5:  it's gonna work that way. I always kind of thought they were gonna do like

1543
01:25:33,445 --> 01:25:37,425
Speaker 5:  you have an inbox and then the like Facebook side inbox

1544
01:25:37,425 --> 01:25:40,385
Speaker 5:  thing that you have to like go way out of your way to do. But there actually

1545
01:25:40,895 --> 01:25:44,425
Speaker 5:  seem to make it a sort of first party messaging system, which is very cool.

1546
01:25:45,045 --> 01:25:47,705
Speaker 5:  And then also there's a screenshot that shows

1547
01:25:48,735 --> 01:25:51,905
Speaker 5:  basically how you will set it up in each app. And

1548
01:25:52,575 --> 01:25:56,425
Speaker 5:  Meta invented two messaging apps just for the sake of these

1549
01:25:56,425 --> 01:26:00,265
Speaker 5:  screenshots. One is called Spruce and one is called Blurb. And I

1550
01:26:00,265 --> 01:26:03,525
Speaker 5:  just have, I have been, I have been designing and product managing Spruce

1551
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:07,245
Speaker 5:  and Blurb all week and I have a lot of thoughts about them as messaging apps.

1552
01:26:07,615 --> 01:26:09,525
Speaker 3:  Which one do you think is better? Spruce or Blurb?

1553
01:26:09,745 --> 01:26:13,725
Speaker 5:  Spruce is like businessy. It's like Spruce is is is kind

1554
01:26:13,725 --> 01:26:17,565
Speaker 5:  of like where you go to to like LinkedIn Vibe blurb is like,

1555
01:26:17,585 --> 01:26:21,285
Speaker 5:  yo, where it's just like, it's just down to clown on blurb time. You just

1556
01:26:21,365 --> 01:26:21,965
Speaker 3:  Blurbing all day.

1557
01:26:21,965 --> 01:26:24,925
Speaker 5:  We're just Blurbing baby. Yeah, yeah. Are you just like, yo, you, you wanna

1558
01:26:24,925 --> 01:26:26,925
Speaker 5:  blurb later? Like, that has connotations. You know what I mean?

1559
01:26:26,925 --> 01:26:28,405
Speaker 3:  Well, no, in yo, you could only, yo

1560
01:26:29,515 --> 01:26:31,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Well, okay. You're right. Blurb is more than yo.

1561
01:26:32,305 --> 01:26:33,765
Speaker 3:  Got it. Okay. Just be clear. But

1562
01:26:33,765 --> 01:26:37,445
Speaker 5:  You can, you can, yo in blurb to be clear, yo is a feature of Blurb

1563
01:26:42,025 --> 01:26:46,005
Speaker 5:  and two super yos equals one blurb. It's important to understand that

1564
01:26:46,365 --> 01:26:49,845
Speaker 3:  I I got it. Yeah. I have a, I have an app in my phone called Bonk. Yeah,

1565
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:51,685
Speaker 3:  yeah, yeah. Is there

1566
01:26:51,685 --> 01:26:53,885
Speaker 5:  Casey Newton got really excited about Bonk for a minute.

1567
01:26:54,235 --> 01:26:55,485
Speaker 3:  Bonk was Yo with Bons.

1568
01:26:56,475 --> 01:27:00,245
Speaker 5:  Bonk was Yo with Bonks. Bonk was like, bonk was like real time

1569
01:27:00,645 --> 01:27:01,205
Speaker 5:  collaborative. Yo.

1570
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:06,605
Speaker 3:  All right. Yeah.

1571
01:27:06,785 --> 01:27:10,725
Speaker 5:  But I, I just think this is very cool and as, as far as

1572
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:14,045
Speaker 5:  we can tell, all of this is just coming to the eu

1573
01:27:14,655 --> 01:27:17,965
Speaker 5:  again, this fascinating schism happening between

1574
01:27:18,505 --> 01:27:21,845
Speaker 5:  the experience of technology in the United States and the eu. And in many

1575
01:27:21,845 --> 01:27:24,845
Speaker 5:  ways the EU is going to be much cooler and more open and more interesting.

1576
01:27:25,665 --> 01:27:29,365
Speaker 5:  But just the way this looks and the way this works has me like actually

1577
01:27:29,595 --> 01:27:32,125
Speaker 5:  sort of excited about what messaging might look like. So I thought that was

1578
01:27:32,125 --> 01:27:32,445
Speaker 5:  cool. Yeah.

1579
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:36,525
Speaker 3:  By the way, the EU thing that you mentioned is I think is gonna be part of

1580
01:27:36,525 --> 01:27:40,365
Speaker 3:  my solution to how to review the iPhones and talk about them. 'cause

1581
01:27:40,365 --> 01:27:43,765
Speaker 3:  Apple intelligence isn't coming to Europe. Oh. So we're just gonna make like

1582
01:27:44,045 --> 01:27:44,965
Speaker 3:  European iPhone content,

1583
01:27:46,555 --> 01:27:50,205
Speaker 3:  continental iPhone content. I love this. And then we'll, we'll make like

1584
01:27:50,205 --> 01:27:54,085
Speaker 3:  Freedom Loving American content Bald eagles everywhere. Yeah. Where

1585
01:27:54,085 --> 01:27:56,325
Speaker 3:  the iPhone is just constantly summarizing everything. It's like text

1586
01:27:58,485 --> 01:28:00,685
Speaker 3:  Summarized America.

1587
01:28:01,385 --> 01:28:02,325
Speaker 5:  All right, NELI, what's yours?

1588
01:28:02,835 --> 01:28:06,725
Speaker 3:  Mine is, you know, more, more AI doism. Mm. Okay. But

1589
01:28:06,725 --> 01:28:10,605
Speaker 3:  in a fun way. This is legitimately I think the most interesting AI

1590
01:28:10,605 --> 01:28:12,165
Speaker 3:  product I've seen yet

1591
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:13,045
Speaker 5:  Do tell.

1592
01:28:13,545 --> 01:28:16,405
Speaker 3:  So Google has this thing called Notebook ml. They've actually, that's two

1593
01:28:16,405 --> 01:28:20,365
Speaker 3:  different versions of this, this core idea. So Google has

1594
01:28:20,365 --> 01:28:23,645
Speaker 3:  this idea, they've settled on this idea. They're gonna take all of their

1595
01:28:23,745 --> 01:28:27,165
Speaker 3:  AI stuff where they can take a bunch of data. They have big context windows

1596
01:28:27,185 --> 01:28:30,565
Speaker 3:  for their model. They can understand a bunch of documents. They have good

1597
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:33,125
Speaker 3:  voice synthesis. They own YouTube.

1598
01:28:34,635 --> 01:28:37,535
Speaker 3:  Here's their idea. We're gonna take a bunch of documents, we're gonna turn

1599
01:28:37,615 --> 01:28:41,085
Speaker 3:  'em into a podcast with voices talking to each other.

1600
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:45,245
Speaker 3:  And so they, they have one for scientific papers, which I believe we have

1601
01:28:45,245 --> 01:28:47,605
Speaker 3:  access to, but we haven't really tested very much. So inside of Notebook,

1602
01:28:47,745 --> 01:28:51,005
Speaker 3:  lm, which is their AI powered notes app that they announced

1603
01:28:51,475 --> 01:28:52,965
Speaker 3:  last year. David, you're my notes.

1604
01:28:53,385 --> 01:28:57,285
Speaker 5:  It was, it was last year. And it's like, if it, imagine a feature

1605
01:28:57,285 --> 01:29:01,045
Speaker 5:  that should be in either Google Keep or Google Docs, but isn't, and that's

1606
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:02,005
Speaker 5:  what Notebook L is.

1607
01:29:02,025 --> 01:29:03,605
Speaker 3:  But it's in blurb from what I understand,

1608
01:29:03,675 --> 01:29:06,605
Speaker 5:  It's, it is, you can blurb to Notebook L for sure. Yeah.

1609
01:29:06,945 --> 01:29:10,405
Speaker 3:  Anyway, so in this app you can give it a bunch of documents and it will just

1610
01:29:10,765 --> 01:29:14,245
Speaker 3:  generate a podcast like two hosts

1611
01:29:14,435 --> 01:29:18,205
Speaker 3:  talking about your documents. And it is kind of remarkably

1612
01:29:18,205 --> 01:29:18,845
Speaker 3:  convincing.

1613
01:29:19,425 --> 01:29:22,165
Speaker 5:  I'm sorry, I've been reading a bunch about this and it's like, I can sort

1614
01:29:22,165 --> 01:29:26,085
Speaker 5:  of understand it, but just hearing you say that sentence, you, you give it

1615
01:29:26,085 --> 01:29:29,525
Speaker 5:  a bunch of documents and it can generate a podcast. I just want to like throw

1616
01:29:29,525 --> 01:29:30,245
Speaker 5:  myself out of a window.

1617
01:29:30,565 --> 01:29:34,525
Speaker 3:  It's like a, and like people have been using it, it, the

1618
01:29:34,525 --> 01:29:38,445
Speaker 3:  podcast host uses phrases like messy as heck. Like they

1619
01:29:38,525 --> 01:29:42,045
Speaker 3:  use idioms. It's just weird. And it's like

1620
01:29:42,265 --> 01:29:45,885
Speaker 3:  Google has had this idea twice now, like, you know, that thing where creatures

1621
01:29:45,885 --> 01:29:49,645
Speaker 3:  evolved to become crabs. It's like Google's AI

1622
01:29:49,645 --> 01:29:53,445
Speaker 3:  efforts evolved to make podcasts out of documents, like

1623
01:29:53,545 --> 01:29:56,245
Speaker 3:  simultaneously evolved twice inside of Google.

1624
01:29:58,845 --> 01:30:02,365
Speaker 3:  I think it's utterly fascinating. You can use it now in notebook. The

1625
01:30:02,365 --> 01:30:05,885
Speaker 3:  weirdest one I've seen is Robert Stevens,

1626
01:30:06,225 --> 01:30:10,125
Speaker 3:  who is the founder of the Geek Squad. The actual Geek Squad in Best Buy,

1627
01:30:10,145 --> 01:30:14,125
Speaker 3:  the founder of the Geek Squad. Robert Stevens appears to

1628
01:30:14,125 --> 01:30:17,765
Speaker 3:  be a member of the Bennett Valley Community Association in Sonoma

1629
01:30:17,765 --> 01:30:21,565
Speaker 3:  County, California. Apparently the Bennett Valley Community Association

1630
01:30:21,865 --> 01:30:25,725
Speaker 3:  has been having a lot of fights about whether to allow

1631
01:30:25,995 --> 01:30:29,455
Speaker 3:  weed to be grown on farms there like commercial

1632
01:30:30,135 --> 01:30:34,105
Speaker 3:  cannabis growing. And so he says he uploaded a bunch of docks and

1633
01:30:34,455 --> 01:30:38,185
Speaker 3:  like meeting notes and PDFs into this tool. And it just

1634
01:30:38,295 --> 01:30:41,625
Speaker 3:  generated a podcast about this fight

1635
01:30:42,055 --> 01:30:45,825
Speaker 3:  that for all the world sounds like a true crime podcast about whether or

1636
01:30:45,825 --> 01:30:47,385
Speaker 3:  not they should grow weed in Snow County.

1637
01:30:49,415 --> 01:30:51,055
Speaker 3:  Can I just play you the beginning of it, please? Yes,

1638
01:30:51,055 --> 01:30:51,175
Speaker 5:  Please.

1639
01:30:51,405 --> 01:30:54,135
Speaker 9:  Alright, ready to dive into another pile of documents.

1640
01:30:54,995 --> 01:30:58,835
Speaker 9:  Always. What do we have this time? Well, today we're headed out west

1641
01:30:58,935 --> 01:31:02,595
Speaker 9:  to Sonoma County, California. Oh, nice. Wine country

1642
01:31:03,735 --> 01:31:07,675
Speaker 9:  for a vacation. Not so fast. This isn't about a relaxing

1643
01:31:07,675 --> 01:31:11,595
Speaker 9:  getaway. It's actually about a pretty heated controversy brewing in

1644
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:15,235
Speaker 9:  Bennett Valley. Bennett Valley. Okay. I'm intrigued. Tell me more.

1645
01:31:15,575 --> 01:31:19,555
Speaker 9:  So it all centers around commercial cannabis cultivation. Seems like

1646
01:31:19,635 --> 01:31:23,395
Speaker 9:  a lot of places have been grappling with this since legalization. Yeah.

1647
01:31:23,805 --> 01:31:27,715
Speaker 3:  Right. It's just like he didn't write that script. Wine country, here's just

1648
01:31:27,755 --> 01:31:31,715
Speaker 3:  a bunch of weird minutes from board meetings and it made

1649
01:31:31,795 --> 01:31:35,675
Speaker 3:  a true. Now is, is it accurate? Did it hallucinate that the

1650
01:31:35,675 --> 01:31:37,995
Speaker 3:  heatedness of this controversy, I don't know, did

1651
01:31:37,995 --> 01:31:40,755
Speaker 5:  It hallucinate that the AI needs a vacation? Yeah, super did.

1652
01:31:41,405 --> 01:31:42,275
Speaker 3:  Super duper did.

1653
01:31:45,895 --> 01:31:49,715
Speaker 3:  God, there's a part in here where it notes correctly If, you

1654
01:31:49,715 --> 01:31:53,475
Speaker 3:  listen to it for longer. It notes correctly that

1655
01:31:54,215 --> 01:31:58,115
Speaker 3:  the board's lawyers told it that its first attempt to ban

1656
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:02,245
Speaker 3:  cannabis cultivation would not work. So the board backed down and tried a

1657
01:32:02,245 --> 01:32:05,965
Speaker 3:  new legal avenue and it issue the AI issues that as a

1658
01:32:05,965 --> 01:32:09,585
Speaker 3:  criticism of the board, which is fascinating for a guy on the board to publish.

1659
01:32:09,965 --> 01:32:13,825
Speaker 3:  But like that's, to me, this is one of the most interesting uses of this

1660
01:32:13,825 --> 01:32:17,745
Speaker 3:  tech that I've seen. No one is making podcasts about

1661
01:32:17,965 --> 01:32:21,425
Speaker 3:  Sonoma County weed controversy. It doesn't seem

1662
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:23,905
Speaker 3:  like there are only four subscribers to

1663
01:32:23,905 --> 01:32:25,825
Speaker 4:  Check. Well, well technically someone did make the podcast,

1664
01:32:26,645 --> 01:32:27,985
Speaker 3:  But Right. But no one and no one

1665
01:32:27,985 --> 01:32:28,345
Speaker 4:  Listens.

1666
01:32:28,625 --> 01:32:32,435
Speaker 3:  I, I'm interested in generally can you make people more

1667
01:32:32,435 --> 01:32:34,595
Speaker 3:  interested in the things that are happening in their community? Yeah. Right.

1668
01:32:35,045 --> 01:32:38,915
Speaker 3:  Every day, wherever you live, there is some board or

1669
01:32:39,155 --> 01:32:42,755
Speaker 3:  HOA or town council that is doing stuff. Yeah.

1670
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:46,075
Speaker 3:  And there's a desert of local news throughout this country.

1671
01:32:47,105 --> 01:32:50,555
Speaker 3:  It's not being covered. If, you can turn it into weird true Crime podcasts.

1672
01:32:50,555 --> 01:32:54,395
Speaker 3:  Is that a, is that actually useful service of ai? I

1673
01:32:54,515 --> 01:32:57,435
Speaker 3:  I, I don't know the answer to that question, but this is the most interesting

1674
01:32:57,605 --> 01:33:00,875
Speaker 3:  thing that I've seen out of it yet. Yeah. All the same problems. Are there,

1675
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:04,195
Speaker 3:  is it gonna hallucinate? Is it telling the truth? Can it be manipulated by

1676
01:33:04,195 --> 01:33:07,595
Speaker 3:  the people who are making it to be favorable to one side or another? Is it

1677
01:33:07,595 --> 01:33:11,235
Speaker 3:  accountable? These are people interesting to listen to. Is it feels like

1678
01:33:11,235 --> 01:33:11,795
Speaker 3:  an important question

1679
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:13,155
Speaker 4:  Wine country.

1680
01:33:14,025 --> 01:33:17,275
Speaker 3:  Well, so what I found, I think the reason that this sparks such interest

1681
01:33:17,275 --> 01:33:21,155
Speaker 3:  to me is not the wine country. They actually were telling a

1682
01:33:21,155 --> 01:33:24,355
Speaker 3:  story. Yeah, no, they, as you go into it, they're like, here are the stakes.

1683
01:33:24,355 --> 01:33:26,635
Speaker 3:  Here's the back and forth. Here's a thing that happened. Here's the next

1684
01:33:26,635 --> 01:33:27,115
Speaker 3:  thing that happened.

1685
01:33:27,225 --> 01:33:31,195
Speaker 4:  This is legitimately like, they, they constantly do this tell a story thing

1686
01:33:31,405 --> 01:33:35,275
Speaker 4:  where they're like, you're just driving in your car and your kid's sad in

1687
01:33:35,275 --> 01:33:38,355
Speaker 4:  the back. And you just have the AI tell it a story. And that's always stupid.

1688
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:41,235
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This is actually like an interesting use case of it,

1689
01:33:41,235 --> 01:33:44,035
Speaker 3:  Right? 'cause there's, there's things that actually happened. Yeah. Again,

1690
01:33:44,055 --> 01:33:47,955
Speaker 3:  do I know if the AI's, I, I'm not deep in, I'm not deep

1691
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:51,635
Speaker 3:  in Bennett Valley's weed controversy. Not yet if

1692
01:33:51,815 --> 01:33:55,035
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna be, but it's just interesting that one like Google announced it.

1693
01:33:55,035 --> 01:33:57,675
Speaker 3:  This is again, they've come up with this idea twice now instead of Google,

1694
01:33:58,415 --> 01:34:02,315
Speaker 3:  and then two people are, are actually using it, right? Like, this

1695
01:34:02,575 --> 01:34:05,635
Speaker 3:  is someone who is on this board who is dealing with this controversy, who

1696
01:34:05,635 --> 01:34:09,275
Speaker 3:  is like, I tried this out. This is good enough to share. Right? This is,

1697
01:34:09,275 --> 01:34:11,995
Speaker 3:  to me he thinks it's good enough to share. I think other people are gonna

1698
01:34:11,995 --> 01:34:15,235
Speaker 3:  use this in other ways. Is this gonna make good podcasts? I don't know. Is

1699
01:34:15,235 --> 01:34:18,675
Speaker 3:  this the most interesting sort of, how do you get people

1700
01:34:19,815 --> 01:34:23,395
Speaker 3:  to consider things in their like local community

1701
01:34:23,665 --> 01:34:26,795
Speaker 3:  that they would not have otherwise considered attempt That I've seen in quite

1702
01:34:26,795 --> 01:34:30,555
Speaker 3:  some time. It sure is. Now, do I think that this works for every case?

1703
01:34:30,715 --> 01:34:33,355
Speaker 3:  'cause notebook alone? Well, you just do anything. You can put any random

1704
01:34:33,355 --> 01:34:37,115
Speaker 3:  assortment of documents in there. I'm very excited to put

1705
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:41,555
Speaker 3:  like any one of our legal decisions in there, like the Google antitrust

1706
01:34:41,955 --> 01:34:45,325
Speaker 3:  decision. I wanna make Google make a podcast on,

1707
01:34:46,615 --> 01:34:49,845
Speaker 3:  right? Like, I'm very, do they, are they gonna do a better job than we do?

1708
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:54,525
Speaker 3:  But there's just something about all of the LLM stuff

1709
01:34:54,735 --> 01:34:58,125
Speaker 3:  where all it's ever really doing is playing with language, right? We've enabled

1710
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:01,885
Speaker 3:  natural language input, we've enabled computers to use language in ways they

1711
01:35:01,885 --> 01:35:05,685
Speaker 3:  couldn't do before, where it's actually this kind of thing that feels like

1712
01:35:05,685 --> 01:35:08,685
Speaker 3:  the most interesting use case. I don't know that this use case can support

1713
01:35:08,905 --> 01:35:10,045
Speaker 3:  the hype or the investment,

1714
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:15,385
Speaker 3:  but actually like we can make your local politics somewhat more

1715
01:35:15,385 --> 01:35:19,185
Speaker 3:  digestible to you. It's the first time I've ever been like, all right,

1716
01:35:19,185 --> 01:35:22,105
Speaker 3:  there's, there's something going on here that seems interesting, that doesn't

1717
01:35:22,105 --> 01:35:25,505
Speaker 3:  seem like massive copyright theft in the end of reality,

1718
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:27,825
Speaker 3:  which is how I usually evaluate these things.

1719
01:35:27,895 --> 01:35:31,745
Speaker 5:  Well, the challenge there is can you have this use case without all that

1720
01:35:31,745 --> 01:35:35,305
Speaker 5:  other stuff? Yeah. I dunno. But, but I, I agree. It is an interesting use

1721
01:35:35,305 --> 01:35:39,225
Speaker 5:  case. And I also, like, I, the, the other news kind of, of this

1722
01:35:39,245 --> 01:35:43,025
Speaker 5:  ilk that came out this week was OpenAI released oh one, it's new

1723
01:35:43,025 --> 01:35:44,985
Speaker 5:  like reasoning capable model.

1724
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:46,305
Speaker 4:  It looks like an emoji,

1725
01:35:46,915 --> 01:35:50,705
Speaker 5:  First of all, terrible name OpenAI said to Kylie Robinson who wrote the story

1726
01:35:50,705 --> 01:35:52,985
Speaker 5:  for us, they were like, oh, we think our names are bad. We try to reboot

1727
01:35:52,985 --> 01:35:56,825
Speaker 5:  it. Like, you, you, you did that again, sorry. Open AI oh

1728
01:35:56,925 --> 01:35:57,545
Speaker 5:  one is nothing.

1729
01:35:59,085 --> 01:36:02,705
Speaker 5:  But one of the things that it does is you ask it a question and

1730
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:07,145
Speaker 5:  because it's a quote unquote reasoning model, it takes longer to answer

1731
01:36:07,145 --> 01:36:10,865
Speaker 5:  because it's just doing more steps at a time. But it will walk you through

1732
01:36:10,925 --> 01:36:14,545
Speaker 5:  the steps that it's taking. And, and Kylie

1733
01:36:14,905 --> 01:36:18,785
Speaker 5:  included this screenshot in which it's saying things like, this is

1734
01:36:18,805 --> 01:36:22,585
Speaker 5:  the, the model reporting back as it's talking, as

1735
01:36:22,585 --> 01:36:25,865
Speaker 5:  it's thinking aloud. I'm curious about defining variables to translate the

1736
01:36:25,865 --> 01:36:28,665
Speaker 5:  problem into algebra. And then a minute later I'm thinking through a new

1737
01:36:29,065 --> 01:36:31,865
Speaker 5:  variable to measure time and establishing clear definitions for years in

1738
01:36:31,865 --> 01:36:35,785
Speaker 5:  the past. And like, we're, we're still down this road of making these things

1739
01:36:35,935 --> 01:36:39,745
Speaker 5:  seem sort of human. It's like when you talk to Siri

1740
01:36:39,745 --> 01:36:43,705
Speaker 5:  and it goes, Hmm. Or and it's like, is this, is this what we

1741
01:36:43,705 --> 01:36:43,865
Speaker 5:  want?

1742
01:36:43,865 --> 01:36:46,385
Speaker 4:  It's the most irritating thing in the world. Yeah. And like, you're fake.

1743
01:36:46,735 --> 01:36:50,145
Speaker 5:  Like, do I want the AI to pretend to be a person?

1744
01:36:50,645 --> 01:36:52,825
Speaker 5:  No, because, and I feel that same way listening to this podcast. I'm like,

1745
01:36:52,825 --> 01:36:54,745
Speaker 5:  are you, what are you, what are you here for?

1746
01:36:56,145 --> 01:36:59,105
Speaker 4:  I want all of them to go and watch like a whole

1747
01:37:00,045 --> 01:37:04,025
Speaker 4:  one of the Star Trek series because they, they actually do interact

1748
01:37:04,025 --> 01:37:06,865
Speaker 4:  with computer. Like the computer's not irritating in it. It's like, hold

1749
01:37:06,865 --> 01:37:08,265
Speaker 4:  on, let me process that

1750
01:37:08,605 --> 01:37:10,025
Speaker 5:  Tea. Earl Gray Hot.

1751
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:10,745
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1752
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:11,865
Speaker 4:  Done.

1753
01:37:12,165 --> 01:37:15,425
Speaker 5:  The tea machine is not like, Hmm. I'm thinking about which blend you might

1754
01:37:15,425 --> 01:37:15,985
Speaker 5:  be. I've

1755
01:37:15,985 --> 01:37:19,745
Speaker 3:  Always wanted to just communicate only in nouns and adjectives. Yeah.

1756
01:37:20,615 --> 01:37:24,545
Speaker 3:  Very good. I will say just to, you know, the people are gonna

1757
01:37:24,545 --> 01:37:27,145
Speaker 3:  yell at me 'cause I said something nice about ai. I'll say something dor

1758
01:37:27,145 --> 01:37:30,625
Speaker 3:  about ai, which is meta has taken the AI labels off of Instagram.

1759
01:37:30,965 --> 01:37:34,865
Speaker 3:  Mm. Or they're hiding them in a menu because none of that

1760
01:37:34,865 --> 01:37:38,385
Speaker 3:  was ready. None of it worked. No one has any point of view. And

1761
01:37:38,505 --> 01:37:42,025
Speaker 3:  LOL nothing matters. They just gave up. We have just given up on this.

1762
01:37:42,475 --> 01:37:46,465
Speaker 3:  We're we're doing AI generated images of, of Elon Musk and

1763
01:37:46,465 --> 01:37:49,625
Speaker 3:  Taylor Swift having a cat baby. That's a real picture that I saw this week.

1764
01:37:51,455 --> 01:37:55,270
Speaker 3:  Why? Why the end?

1765
01:37:56,865 --> 01:38:00,735
Speaker 3:  There you go. You said it all. This is like the real, the real

1766
01:38:00,805 --> 01:38:04,375
Speaker 3:  plus and minus of it right now. Like, oh, maybe this will help people engage

1767
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:08,135
Speaker 3:  in local communities. I will have to see this picture and there will be no

1768
01:38:08,135 --> 01:38:11,015
Speaker 3:  label on it because no one figured out how any of that works. And maybe it

1769
01:38:11,015 --> 01:38:14,735
Speaker 3:  never will. That's it. That's the RB has everybody. Yay.

1770
01:38:15,245 --> 01:38:18,815
Speaker 3:  Fold your phone in half. Any phone. It doesn't have to actually be a fold.

1771
01:38:18,965 --> 01:38:22,415
Speaker 3:  Just get out there and start folding phones in half Bridge, strength, rock

1772
01:38:22,415 --> 01:38:22,655
Speaker 3:  and roll.

1773
01:38:26,715 --> 01:38:29,735
Speaker 1:  And that's it for The Verge Cast this week. Hey, we'd love to hear from you.
