22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,240
Speaker 6:  confess, I just lied. There is not an episode of the Vergecast today because

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,040
Speaker 6:  I am in Disney World having a great time on vacation, but don't worry,

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,920
Speaker 6:  going on in the news this week with lots of other people from the Verge.

28
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,520
Speaker 6:  Stay tuned. Until then, have a great day. Rock and Roll.

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,470
Speaker 7:  Lakshmi, I wanna tell you about this guy, a dating app guy,

30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,910
Speaker 7:  sort of. He's been using dating apps for nearly a decade,

31
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,310
Speaker 7:  but a few years ago he discovered something about them that made him feel

32
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,430
Speaker 7:  a little cheated. His name is Eve Gilbert.

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,790
Speaker 7:  He's an attorney in Midtown Manhattan. It's sick that you're a lawyer.

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,270
Speaker 2:  Oh, thank you. It does surprise a lot of people.

35
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,590
Speaker 7:  When I met him, he was wearing these heart shaped Lolita glasses

36
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,750
Speaker 7:  and leather pants. You're definitely the most stylish lawyer that

37
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,430
Speaker 7:  I've come

38
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,110
Speaker 2:  Across. Thank you. That is what I aim for.

39
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,150
Speaker 7:  And when it comes to the apps, he's seen it all. He told me he started using

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,510
Speaker 7:  them when he was pretty young,

41
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,750
Speaker 2:  Like most little gay kids I was using like Grindr when I

42
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,630
Speaker 2:  first started. Cause that's like really the only way to like meet other

43
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,070
Speaker 2:  gay people.

44
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,910
Speaker 7:  Grindr was enough when he was living in the suburbs, but he moved to New York

45
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,830
Speaker 7:  in 2016 and had a new city new me moment and so we decided

46
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,750
Speaker 7:  to try some new dating apps. Okay, Cupid was first.

47
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,470
Speaker 7:  It had these quirky, queer friendly ads on the subway that caught his eye.

48
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,710
Speaker 2:  I do fall for ads very easily.

49
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,230
Speaker 7:  Then he got on Tinder.

50
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,590
Speaker 2:  When I started, Tinder was like, oh, this is the fancy one.

51
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,240
Speaker 2:  This is the one that you go go to to meet like a more long-term partner.

52
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,200
Speaker 7:  At the time, Tinder was already building a reputation as a hookup app,

53
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,640
Speaker 7:  but when Gilbert compared it to Grindr it actually felt more serious.

54
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,920
Speaker 7:  So he was on these apps for years and went on so many bad dates. You know,

55
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,360
Speaker 7:  he wanted to be done.

56
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,320
Speaker 8:  I mean dating burnout is real.

57
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,360
Speaker 7:  Totally. And then in 2018 he thought he saw the light

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,120
Speaker 7:  at the end of the tunnel hinge. It was supposed to have

59
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,000
Speaker 7:  this sophisticated algorithm, you know, high quality matches. The app

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,920
Speaker 7:  pitched itself as designed to be deleted

61
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,040
Speaker 2:  And then I, I think the first five or six profiles I've seen

62
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,200
Speaker 2:  were people I had already talked to and some of them I had already like been

63
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,000
Speaker 2:  on dates with like the same dates. That precipitated me switching

64
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,400
Speaker 2:  to a new app.

65
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,920
Speaker 8:  Okay, so I think I know where this story is going.

66
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,160
Speaker 7:  Did you proceed to match with them or did you like throw your

67
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,520
Speaker 7:  phone away in frustration?

68
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,840
Speaker 2:  It just made me sit there for a bit. I was like, this is

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,640
Speaker 2:  New York. It's one of the biggest cities in the world. These

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,160
Speaker 2:  cannot be the only options here.

71
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,640
Speaker 7:  He did not throw his phone, but he was left with a

72
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,520
Speaker 7:  rage induced curiosity. Okay, Cupid, Tinder

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,720
Speaker 7:  Hinge, these apps were all marketed differently. They

74
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,600
Speaker 7:  were supposed to provide distinct experiences, so why

75
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,340
Speaker 7:  did using them feel so similar? After doing a bit of

76
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,780
Speaker 7:  research, he realized that all of the apps he'd been using over the years

77
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,380
Speaker 7:  besides Grindr were under the same corporate umbrella.

78
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,710
Speaker 2:  Honestly, I felt kind of like cheated in a

79
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,670
Speaker 2:  way. It's like, okay, Tinder has been treating me badly, so lemme try

80
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,470
Speaker 2:  Hinge. You know, kind of like the same way like if you have a bad product,

81
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,390
Speaker 2:  you're like, oh, I'm gonna buy like that competitor's product instead

82
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,990
Speaker 7:  Dozens of dating apps and websites all owned by the same company.

83
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,030
Speaker 7:  That company is Match Group.

84
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,590
Speaker 2:  I'm like, how? How is this possible?

85
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,470
Speaker 8:  This is Land of the Giants Match Group owns nearly

86
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,150
Speaker 8:  all of the top dating apps in the United States, which means

87
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,950
Speaker 8:  it controls the way dating works for millions of people.

88
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,550
Speaker 7:  That's a lot of power for one company to hold and it got

89
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,910
Speaker 7:  all of that power through a long campaign of buying up the competition

90
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,870
Speaker 8:  And steering our romantic lives. It's been a lucrative business

91
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,350
Speaker 8:  for Match Group. It knows our most intimate preferences and

92
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,030
Speaker 8:  behaviors and Match uses that data to better sell

93
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,190
Speaker 8:  itself to build new features that make more money

94
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,550
Speaker 8:  from our desire to connect.

95
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,790
Speaker 7:  But what about users as Match Group perfects the

96
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,990
Speaker 7:  business model of dating? Are people seeing better results?

97
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,720
Speaker 8:  That is a great question. Sangita, since I used to

98
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,200
Speaker 8:  work at Match Group, we thought it'd be a good idea to hear your fresh take

99
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,880
Speaker 8:  on Matches story. I can't wait to hear what you find out.

100
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,280
Speaker 7:  Thanks Lakshmi.

101
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,540
Speaker 7:  the.com boom in the nineties was a bit of a wild west and a young

102
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,140
Speaker 7:  computer scientist named Gary Kremin wanted to try his luck.

103
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,620
Speaker 7:  He had an B from Stanford, but his big business idea was pretty simple.

104
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,100
Speaker 7:  He bought up a bunch of catchy domain names,

105
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,980
Speaker 7:  jobs.com, housing.com,

106
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,100
Speaker 7:  autos.com. He also owned sex.com and

107
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,060
Speaker 7:  match.com. In 1995, the first version

108
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,300
Speaker 7:  of match.com would've looked familiar.

109
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,420
Speaker 9:  I've seen old mockups and like they literally looked like the

110
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,420
Speaker 9:  classified section in a newspaper, which probably don't even exist anymore.

111
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,580
Speaker 7:  That's Amna Tomb Bray. He's the CEO of Match Group

112
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,780
Speaker 7:  Americas and that was exactly the idea

113
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,060
Speaker 7:  that Match and all of those other domains would function as a

114
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,900
Speaker 7:  sort of online classified space. Kremen created

115
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,260
Speaker 7:  a company called Electric classified to houses his domains

116
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,260
Speaker 7:  named himself the c o and set out to conquer the

117
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,140
Speaker 7:  digital classified business and what respectable classified

118
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,860
Speaker 7:  section didn't have personal ads. The only thing was that

119
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,460
Speaker 7:  personal ads weren't always that respectable.

120
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,580
Speaker 10:  In the mid nineties, a lot of the media was

121
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,900
Speaker 10:  talking about the dangers of the internet. Not only that

122
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,900
Speaker 10:  personals, which were mostly newspaper 900 numbers

123
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,340
Speaker 10:  had a very bad reputation.

124
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,020
Speaker 7:  Fran Meyer was a classmate of Cremins from Stanford

125
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,100
Speaker 7:  When she joined Electric classifieds, Kremen put her in charge of

126
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,060
Speaker 7:  match.com. Personals had an image problem.

127
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,580
Speaker 7:  Meyer says that the personal ads sections of local weekly

128
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,100
Speaker 7:  newspapers often featured fake ads that were

129
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,180
Speaker 7:  basically scams

130
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,460
Speaker 10:  Ads like I'm interested in a gang bang, really

131
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,380
Speaker 10:  disgusting that would though generate lots

132
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,340
Speaker 10:  of phone calls to the 900 number. Okay, so this

133
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,260
Speaker 10:  is the reason why personals were were considered fairly

134
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:19,940
Speaker 10:  sleazy.

135
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,260
Speaker 7:  Beyond that the internet was new for most people and for

136
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,900
Speaker 7:  those who were already online meeting someone often meant anonymous

137
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,220
Speaker 7:  conversations in occasionally sketchy chat rooms.

138
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,740
Speaker 7:  So Match and Meyer had to figure out how to clean up the SL factor

139
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,780
Speaker 7:  and begin to build trust. She said that they started

140
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,380
Speaker 7:  with the idea that men would follow women and the way to get women on Match

141
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,300
Speaker 7:  was to make sure the men were serious. A great way to do so, make

142
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,940
Speaker 7:  them pay to use the service subscriptions.

143
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,340
Speaker 10:  Once we started charging, the percentage of women went up

144
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,180
Speaker 10:  almost immediately and I think it's because it sort of

145
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,060
Speaker 10:  qualified the guides that were on the service. There were a lot of other

146
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,460
Speaker 10:  online personals, but there was none that was really taking

147
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,020
Speaker 10:  a brand focused, target focused approach and I

148
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,820
Speaker 10:  think that's why we emerged as the winner from really

149
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,980
Speaker 10:  for the very beginning.

150
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,780
Speaker 11:  Today we adapt our regular weekly feature computer line

151
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,860
Speaker 11:  to Valentine's Day. The search for True Romance as you probably

152
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,420
Speaker 11:  know can begin just about anywhere but these days many of those seeking

153
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,860
Speaker 11:  soulmates are turning to the internet

154
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,940
Speaker 7:  Online. Dating's rebrand got the Good Morning America's seal of approval

155
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,460
Speaker 7:  in the late nineties. By then a lot had changed.

156
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,780
Speaker 7:  For one thing, more people were using the internet and culturally

157
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,180
Speaker 7:  things were shifting too. Conversations about

158
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,060
Speaker 7:  cybersex in shows like Sex in the City and films like You've Got

159
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,660
Speaker 7:  Male were helping to eradicate the online dating is

160
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,580
Speaker 7:  dangerous and weird stigma. It wasn't enough for the owners of

161
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,660
Speaker 7:  Electric classifieds. Kremen was already gone. He'd bounced in

162
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,420
Speaker 7:  96 after butting heads with Investors. A parade of

163
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,500
Speaker 7:  new CEOs did not see a future for online dating

164
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,740
Speaker 7:  in 1997. Electric classifieds sold

165
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,620
Speaker 7:  match.com.

166
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,500
Speaker 7:  This is where Media mogul Barry Diller comes in. His

167
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,780
Speaker 7:  company bought match.com in 1999 for 50 million.

168
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,020
Speaker 7:  Diller was an entertainment executive who'd been the chairman at

169
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,420
Speaker 7:  Paramount Pictures and launched the Fox Network in

170
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,500
Speaker 7:  1995. He made his last big play in TV and bought a bunch of

171
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,460
Speaker 7:  regional stations.

172
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,900
Speaker 12:  Then along came the internet and essentially we followed our curiosity,

173
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,860
Speaker 12:  right? We're not deal junkies in a sense, but there was a lot of curiosity

174
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,140
Speaker 12:  and a ton of opportunity and so

175
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,260
Speaker 12:  we just followed the opportunity

176
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,580
Speaker 7:  That Stiller speaking to Fortune Magazine. Opportunity to

177
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,220
Speaker 7:  him meant gathering his acquisitions under one corporate umbrella.

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,860
Speaker 7:  The name of his behemoth was InterActiveCorp IAC for

179
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,460
Speaker 7:  short. When IAC bought match.com, the

180
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,100
Speaker 7:  website had 500,000 users. That's roughly the

181
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,900
Speaker 7:  population of Minneapolis, but Diller wanted match to dominate the

182
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,420
Speaker 7:  whole country and then the world.

183
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,340
Speaker 7:  He did what he did best and went on a deal making spree. He bought

184
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,140
Speaker 7:  exclusive rights to the personal section of New York Mag and b e t.

185
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,740
Speaker 7:  He partnered with M S N and A O L to increase matches membership

186
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,620
Speaker 7:  base. Then there was the Marketing National

187
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,460
Speaker 7:  radio and TV spots inviting people to come and get your love.

188
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,420
Speaker 7:  A very 2006 partnership with Dr. Phil

189
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,660
Speaker 13:  Jodi. Whoa, Jodi,

190
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:47,980
Speaker 7:  Sorry.

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,500
Speaker 13:  You still daydreaming about Mr. Wright? Yeah, you've got

192
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,360
Speaker 13:  personality Looks iq, you just need little guy

193
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,120
Speaker 13:  Q. That's all.

194
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,760
Speaker 14:  Visit match.com today.

195
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,120
Speaker 7:  A campaign for people who still felt like online dating was for losers.

196
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,240
Speaker 7:  It featured real match users

197
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,560
Speaker 7:  in this ad from 2007. Danish Beauty

198
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,680
Speaker 7:  22 is wearing an evening gown. She's gorgeous and

199
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,560
Speaker 7:  glamorous. The tagline for the campaign, it's okay to

200
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,400
Speaker 7:  look whether it was matches aggressive marketing,

201
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,440
Speaker 7:  greater internet usage, a shift in pop culture or

202
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,390
Speaker 7:  all of these things. At some point online dating became a

203
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,990
Speaker 7:  thing and match.com was leading the pack.

204
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,740
Speaker 7:  Here's Diller again, speaking to Fortune in 2009, about

205
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,540
Speaker 7:  10 years after first buying match

206
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,140
Speaker 12:  Million, 500,000 people pay 25 bucks a month or so

207
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,580
Speaker 12:  to do this thing now and that's a very

208
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,060
Speaker 12:  good margin. Really remarkably solid

209
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:56,500
Speaker 12:  business

210
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,060
Speaker 7:  With a solid business, a good margin and cash flow

211
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,340
Speaker 7:  IAC could use. Its for chest to level up match.com into something

212
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,300
Speaker 7:  entirely new.

213
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,180
Speaker 16:  IAC is a holding company, meaning they have stakes in

214
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,980
Speaker 16:  a variety of other businesses and so it's like

215
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,980
Speaker 16:  a conglomerate. They don't just have one type of business.

216
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,300
Speaker 7:  David Marcus runs Evermore Global Advisors, an

217
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,740
Speaker 7:  investment firm that specializes in holding companies like iac.

218
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,620
Speaker 7:  Marcus is a big fan of the Diller way.

219
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,860
Speaker 16:  I think of IAC as a compounding machine. They just do this.

220
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,620
Speaker 16:  They put in these tiny things, spend years developing them.

221
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,420
Speaker 16:  Then what comes out the other side is a great business that can

222
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,300
Speaker 16:  live and stand and thrive on its own. Put it even

223
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,260
Speaker 16:  more simply. Think about a magician's hat. IAC itself is

224
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,100
Speaker 16:  the magician's hat and over the years he's been pulling all these rabbits

225
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,820
Speaker 16:  out, but these are rabbits that are multi-billion dollar opportunities.

226
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,060
Speaker 7:  It wasn't enough that match.com was growing and making money.

227
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,340
Speaker 7:  Diller still wanted to forge a company that would dominate online dating

228
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,220
Speaker 7:  entirely.

229
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,580
Speaker 7:  In 2009, match.com became Match Group

230
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,900
Speaker 7:  its strategy to eat the competition. That

231
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,860
Speaker 7:  same year Match Group made its first acquisition People Media

232
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,580
Speaker 7:  for 80 million. A little over a year later

233
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,380
Speaker 7:  it acquired Metech. Each of these sites brought

234
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,100
Speaker 7:  something unique to the business people. Media had niche brands,

235
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,580
Speaker 7:  specifically social connection websites that included our

236
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,540
Speaker 7:  time.com and black people meet.com. Meic was

237
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,140
Speaker 7:  really popular in France and let Match get its tentacles into the

238
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,260
Speaker 7:  European market. But the most important thing was that these

239
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,980
Speaker 7:  acquisitions brought millions more people under the Match group

240
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,140
Speaker 7:  umbrella. So Match Group was growing but it was also wary of the

241
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,780
Speaker 7:  competition. Its biggest problem in 2011 was

242
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,620
Speaker 7:  OkCupid.

243
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,060
Speaker 7:  The site was reaching younger Gen Xers and millennials who were curious

244
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,980
Speaker 7:  about online dating but reluctant to Fort Co for $30 a month

245
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,860
Speaker 7:  for a match.com subscription and OkCupid was free.

246
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,140
Speaker 7:  It liked to rub that in matches face. In fact, in those days

247
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,140
Speaker 7:  it cast a lot of aspersions on match matches. Marketing

248
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,780
Speaker 7:  claimed that 12 couples got engaged today thanks to match.com.

249
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,620
Speaker 7:  OkCupid took aim at this brag with a snarky blog post suggesting that

250
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,940
Speaker 7:  given matches scale, this was kind of a rip off.

251
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,220
Speaker 7:  What's more compared to OkCupid Match was old school.

252
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,180
Speaker 7:  Its users were still building and browsing elaborate profiles.

253
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,020
Speaker 7:  OkCupid did things a little differently. It had a user's

254
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,900
Speaker 7:  answer tons of personality questions to get a compatibility percentage

255
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,700
Speaker 7:  with other users. It felt scientific but fun.

256
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,740
Speaker 9:  So in the case of OkCupid, it was clearly attracting

257
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,500
Speaker 9:  like a more coastal, progressive,

258
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,260
Speaker 9:  geeky data-oriented person.

259
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,700
Speaker 7:  Ana Torey, c e o of Match Americas.

260
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,860
Speaker 9:  So it was a very unique passionate user base that like to answer questions

261
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,260
Speaker 9:  and like it was a very different way of analyzing and matching

262
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,580
Speaker 9:  people as well as assessing people.

263
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,500
Speaker 7:  So instead of competing with OkCupid Match just bought it

264
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,640
Speaker 7:  Match's. Next major Target was Plenty of Phish, a free dating site that

265
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,200
Speaker 7:  was wildly popular in the mid 2010s. It was

266
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,800
Speaker 7:  launched by Marcus friend, a computer scientist back in

267
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,440
Speaker 7:  2003 and it became so successful because friend

268
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,120
Speaker 7:  mastered the s e o game. When people searched for dating in LA

269
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,080
Speaker 7:  or dating in New York, they would see plenty of Phish at the top of

270
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,600
Speaker 7:  the results. Kim Kaplan joined the company in 2009.

271
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,080
Speaker 18:  So my first week at Plenty of Fish, we went to an online dating

272
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,040
Speaker 18:  conference in Miami and Marcus got up on stage and

273
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,890
Speaker 18:  was presented with a Darth Vader helmet and it was basically

274
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,650
Speaker 18:  them saying you're going to kill everybody in the industry.

275
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,010
Speaker 7:  In a 2009 profile in Ink Magazine friend talked

276
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,930
Speaker 7:  about how he worked one hour a day and made 10 million each year

277
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,370
Speaker 7:  running the site from his apartment.

278
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,690
Speaker 18:  Marcus said he would never sell he he reiterated that

279
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,570
Speaker 18:  number of times to everybody, I'm never selling, I'm never selling, I'm

280
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:23,970
Speaker 18:  never selling.

281
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,490
Speaker 7:  Why would he? He was making millions and he owned 100%

282
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,290
Speaker 7:  of Plenty of fish, which by the way was true to its name.

283
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,410
Speaker 7:  It had 3.6 million daily active users. In

284
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,050
Speaker 7:  2015 Amna Tre again,

285
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,010
Speaker 9:  I think it was number two in the country.

286
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,970
Speaker 9:  So that was like, obviously it was huge and extremely popular

287
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,080
Speaker 9:  in like the smaller towns or small town America.

288
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,440
Speaker 7:  This was obviously a problem for Match Group, a rival dating

289
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,480
Speaker 7:  platform with huge reach that refused to be bought,

290
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,840
Speaker 7:  but at some point friend's position on selling had

291
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,440
Speaker 7:  evolved. He went to dinner with Match

292
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,920
Speaker 7:  Sam Yagan and by the end of it, match owned Plenty of Fish

293
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:16,040
Speaker 7:  Friend left with over half a billion dollars in his pocket.

294
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,760
Speaker 7:  It was Match group's largest acquisition to date with plenty of

295
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,560
Speaker 7:  fish in its portfolio. Match group now owned four of the five

296
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,080
Speaker 7:  top dating brands in North America This

297
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,240
Speaker 19:  Morning the biggest dating websites are getting ready to Woo. Wall Street.

298
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,000
Speaker 19:  Barry Diller's

299
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,160
Speaker 7:  Company in November, 2015, match Group went public.

300
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,400
Speaker 7:  It was the moment when Barry Diller pulled the rabbit out of his magician's

301
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,840
Speaker 7:  hat and showed Wall Street just how much online dating was worth.

302
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,000
Speaker 7:  IAC had spent nearly 1.3 billion to acquire 25

303
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,880
Speaker 7:  brands for its dating portfolio match group's. Market Cap

304
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,680
Speaker 7:  at I P O was nearly $3 billion.

305
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,760
Speaker 7:  More and more daters were turning to mobile apps to meet people. While

306
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,640
Speaker 7:  Match owned the most popular mobile dating app out there, it wasn't

307
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,400
Speaker 7:  bringing in much money that was about to change.

308
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,240
Speaker 7:  In 2013, about a third of Match groups users were

309
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,000
Speaker 7:  signing up for its products on mobile devices. By 2015,

310
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,000
Speaker 7:  that number was closer to 70%. Part of this was thanks

311
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,640
Speaker 7:  to Tinder, which was created in an incubator owned by iac.

312
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,760
Speaker 7:  That relationship eventually evolved into Match Group owning the app.

313
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,840
Speaker 7:  Tinder still had something of a startup spirit, though it

314
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,240
Speaker 7:  spent the first couple of years focused on growth, not revenue.

315
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,920
Speaker 7:  That all changed when Match Group was preparing to go public.

316
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,120
Speaker 20:  I do remember, you know finding out like, oh hey, we have to monetize, but

317
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,920
Speaker 20:  I think based upon an earnings call

318
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,320
Speaker 7:  That's Jonathan Badin, one of the co-founders of Tinder

319
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,680
Speaker 20:  And I was like, wait, we're we're what? I was like, okay,

320
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,600
Speaker 7:  Tinder had followed a common playbook, make the app free

321
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,440
Speaker 7:  and figure out how to make money later. Well it was later

322
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,800
Speaker 7:  and Match Group wanted Tinder users to start paying up

323
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:28,200
Speaker 7:  Tinder just had to find out what users would actually shell out for.

324
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,480
Speaker 7:  Jess Caro was one of the people tasked with figuring that out.

325
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,760
Speaker 7:  In 2014 she was studying sociology at UCLA and

326
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,600
Speaker 7:  writing about online dating for her dissertation. She was

327
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,480
Speaker 7:  also using dating apps. Caro had recently matched with

328
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,320
Speaker 7:  Sean Rad, another one of Tinder's co-founders. She took it as a

329
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,640
Speaker 7:  sign when he started to message her while she was on a boring date a few

330
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,160
Speaker 7:  days later

331
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,800
Speaker 21:  I was literally like back and forth while all this was happening in the

332
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,520
Speaker 21:  bathroom live messaging Sean, the guy either thought I had a urinary tract

333
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,400
Speaker 21:  infection or a Cohan habit or I was just woefully uninterested. It

334
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,320
Speaker 21:  was obviously the third option here.

335
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,480
Speaker 7:  She pitched her research and herself and soon enough she was working

336
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,640
Speaker 7:  at Tinder's offices in West Hollywood.

337
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,500
Speaker 7:  One of her tasks she says, was to dig through the data from Tinder's user

338
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,100
Speaker 7:  surveys.

339
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,540
Speaker 21:  I helped them monetize. I helped them figure out, you know what people were

340
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,580
Speaker 21:  willing to pay for.

341
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,460
Speaker 7:  She wanted to know would members drop money on a tool that would

342
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,900
Speaker 7:  help them stand out from the crowd?

343
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,380
Speaker 21:  How often were they going to use it? Under what

344
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,340
Speaker 21:  circumstances would they use it? Were men more likely to use it than women?

345
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,020
Speaker 21:  These were all questions that I was trying to answer in the back of my mind

346
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,900
Speaker 21:  to understand the motivation for whether or not we should be investing in

347
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,020
Speaker 21:  it.

348
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,300
Speaker 7:  Her research was fed to teams that developed special features.

349
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,340
Speaker 7:  What Tinder calls superpowers. There was the boost

350
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,300
Speaker 7:  which got your profile seen by more people for a limited period and the

351
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,780
Speaker 7:  super like, but you could send someone to show them that you really liked

352
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,500
Speaker 7:  them, but these features were not free. Ana

353
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,220
Speaker 7:  tore again,

354
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,380
Speaker 9:  We are constantly looking at various ways to

355
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,460
Speaker 9:  say give users a way to enhance their chance at succeeding

356
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,860
Speaker 9:  on the app and that's something that users always willing to pay for

357
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,900
Speaker 7:  And users did. They spent millions seeking an advantage

358
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,820
Speaker 7:  on the app and on subscriptions, which Tinder added next

359
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,900
Speaker 7:  in 2016 it brought in 169 million

360
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,050
Speaker 7:  in revenue and still match wasn't finished.

361
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,330
Speaker 7:  There were plenty of other dating apps that could pose a threat to Tinder's

362
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:46,130
Speaker 7:  dominance. So Match Group went back to its

363
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,330
Speaker 7:  old playbook competition, no problem,

364
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,530
Speaker 7:  we'll just buy it in the mid 2010s. Dating

365
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,090
Speaker 7:  apps were mostly the same.

366
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,370
Speaker 2:  All the dating apps were Tinder except for what's your One Little Wrinkle?

367
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,370
Speaker 7:  That's Tim. Matt Duggan, a former executive at Hinge.

368
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,130
Speaker 7:  In the early years, hinge was pretty much just like Tinder,

369
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,330
Speaker 7:  but it used social media to connect users to friends of friends.

370
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,330
Speaker 2:  We were chasing their tails. We had a swiping experience very much like theirs.

371
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,050
Speaker 2:  We had profiles very much like theirs. We had a couple little things that

372
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,890
Speaker 2:  made it a little bit different and we had a little bit of a different ethos

373
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,090
Speaker 2:  and all that was well and good, but ultimately people saw us as the same

374
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,050
Speaker 2:  kind of product and they used us in the same way as a numbers scheme,

375
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,170
Speaker 7:  But Hinch didn't want to be Tinder. It wanted to beat Tinder

376
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,850
Speaker 22:  Internally we were like at war against Tinder. We were like, we need our

377
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,410
Speaker 22:  product to be better than Tinders. They're all about gamification. We're

378
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,570
Speaker 22:  all about like really like human design.

379
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,920
Speaker 7:  Lucy Mort was a product designer at Hinge in late 2015

380
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,920
Speaker 7:  when that war against Tinder took shape.

381
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,600
Speaker 7:  A Vanity Fair piece on Tinder's role in the rise of hookup culture had gone

382
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,320
Speaker 7:  mega viral. Tinder it said was Patient zero

383
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:04,360
Speaker 7:  in the quote dating Apocalypse Romance as we

384
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,320
Speaker 7:  knew it had been destroyed, Tinder had reduced it to swiping and bad

385
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,160
Speaker 7:  sex and anyone who was serious about finding a partner was out of luck.

386
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,440
Speaker 7:  This is music from an animated video that was part of Hinges anti

387
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,360
Speaker 7:  Tinder campaign in it, a man who looks a lot like

388
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,040
Speaker 7:  Hinge ceo Justin McLeod wanders through a kind of

389
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,680
Speaker 7:  dating hellscape with signs to attractions like eye candy

390
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,240
Speaker 7:  and one nighter.

391
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:39,400
Speaker 7:  Then he walks through a door that says Hinge and finds a bright paradise

392
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,920
Speaker 7:  of happy couples. The campaign was called the Dating

393
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,240
Speaker 7:  Apocalypse, the same name as that Vanity Fair piece.

394
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,800
Speaker 7:  It was not exactly subtle

395
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,080
Speaker 7:  if most other apps were just Tinder with a twist hinges new

396
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,000
Speaker 7:  plan was to be everything that Tinder wasn't to be the anti

397
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,480
Speaker 7:  Tinder.

398
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,360
Speaker 22:  We knew that if you can really like get to the core of what a

399
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,920
Speaker 22:  young single woman's problem is and solve that,

400
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,320
Speaker 22:  then you were going to like have a successful dating product

401
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,000
Speaker 22:  and at the time it was like single millennial women. They were just like

402
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,720
Speaker 22:  so tired of hookup culture, tired of like not really

403
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,400
Speaker 22:  knowing a man's intentions and that was the problem that we really said

404
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:23,880
Speaker 22:  about solving.

405
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,160
Speaker 7:  Mort led a redesign of Hinge to make it feel less hindery.

406
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,440
Speaker 7:  It started with dropping the swipe.

407
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,320
Speaker 2:  The traditional swiping app experience was a numbers

408
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,720
Speaker 2:  game.

409
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:40,040
Speaker 22:  It did lead to this like culture where people

410
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:44,600
Speaker 22:  weren't coming into using a dating app with intention of really like

411
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,840
Speaker 22:  dating and getting to know someone and getting into a relationship.

412
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,800
Speaker 2:  What we wanted to do was to create a

413
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,920
Speaker 2:  environment where actions meant what they were

414
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,440
Speaker 2:  supposed to mean.

415
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,360
Speaker 22:  So we knew we had to like slow people down to make sure they're really

416
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,080
Speaker 22:  measured with their decisions and to like help get the conversation started.

417
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,440
Speaker 7:  While Tinder liked to brag about its billions of swipes and

418
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,520
Speaker 7:  introductions, hinge used different metrics, good

419
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,440
Speaker 7:  dates per user became the app's North Star. According to Tim,

420
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,080
Speaker 7:  Matt Gin,

421
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,720
Speaker 2:  If we were the best at creating dates for our users, we would win.

422
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,880
Speaker 7:  In 2017, hinges strategy had started to work.

423
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:29,360
Speaker 7:  It was gaining users and venture capitalists were getting curious.

424
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,560
Speaker 7:  They weren't the only ones.

425
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,240
Speaker 9:  I'm always looking for like what's missing, right? Like is there a

426
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,160
Speaker 9:  need user need out there that's that is not being served.

427
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,760
Speaker 7:  Ana Tre again,

428
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,880
Speaker 9:  Tinder was like fun and fast and easy

429
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,080
Speaker 9:  and like everyone loved it but there was a certain

430
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,320
Speaker 9:  kind of user, which I think I I call it like more

431
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,120
Speaker 9:  intentional like millennial who wanted like to spend

432
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,360
Speaker 9:  more time on each profile, be a little more intentional about who they wanna

433
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,200
Speaker 9:  meet, learn more about that person. They wanted something

434
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,920
Speaker 9:  cool and fun and modern as Tinder but a little like

435
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,080
Speaker 9:  slow and intentional.

436
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,640
Speaker 7:  In theory, acquiring Hinge would help match Group remain a

437
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,440
Speaker 7:  one-stop shop for any online dating experience a user could

438
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,080
Speaker 7:  want. You know if you hate Tinder, we've got the anti Tinder.

439
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,520
Speaker 7:  So in 2017 Match made an initial investment in

440
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,880
Speaker 7:  Hinge. Two years later it bought the whole thing.

441
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,680
Speaker 7:  Hinge hadn't beaten Tinder, it had joined it but

442
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,360
Speaker 7:  that was good enough for Matt Gin.

443
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:42,040
Speaker 2:  It was a strong sense of validation that what we were doing was working and

444
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,520
Speaker 2:  that we had a a promising future

445
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,320
Speaker 7:  And Hinge maintained its image as the anti Tinder. After

446
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,440
Speaker 7:  joining Match Group

447
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,400
Speaker 23:  Hinge wants you to meet someone great

448
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,600
Speaker 23:  even if it kills us.

449
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,360
Speaker 23:  Hinge, the dating app designed to be deleted

450
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,160
Speaker 7:  But Match didn't buy Hinge just to fill out a place in its portfolio.

451
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,360
Speaker 7:  It expected the app to bring in cash too.

452
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,470
Speaker 2:  We needed to make money and so

453
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,350
Speaker 2:  we needed to show a return on investment. So 2020 was the year when

454
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,610
Speaker 2:  we needed to monetize.

455
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,170
Speaker 7:  Good thing there was already a playbook for that. Tinder's business

456
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:30,090
Speaker 7:  model was a proven success. It had made hundreds of millions

457
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,850
Speaker 7:  of dollars selling superpowers a la carte and bundling them

458
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:37,630
Speaker 7:  into premium subscriptions. In 2019, Tinder

459
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,550
Speaker 7:  bought in 1.2 billion in direct revenue. It

460
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,790
Speaker 7:  made sense for Hinge to go down the same path.

461
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,710
Speaker 2:  What you can pay for is a more effective

462
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,350
Speaker 2:  or accelerated experience of finding your next date,

463
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,710
Speaker 2:  engaging with more people at once, getting more attention.

464
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,750
Speaker 7:  Hinge debuted a new feature called the Rose in 2020.

465
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,510
Speaker 7:  If you saw someone you really liked, you could send them a rose.

466
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:10,830
Speaker 7:  Every user got a free rose each week. The idea was that

467
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,790
Speaker 7:  if you were willing to part with your precious rose for someone, they'd be

468
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,630
Speaker 7:  more likely to hit you back. The Rose also bumped you to the top of

469
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,030
Speaker 7:  their list of people who had liked them. You might be buried otherwise

470
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,710
Speaker 7:  and a Rose could also get you access to people who are the most

471
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:29,950
Speaker 7:  desirable on the app, so-called standouts.

472
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,510
Speaker 7:  You could buy more roses for 3 99 a pop and of

473
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:38,350
Speaker 7:  course they're cheaper by the dozen. If all of this

474
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,280
Speaker 7:  sounds familiar. That's because the Rose is just Tinder's super like in

475
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,120
Speaker 7:  cellophane packaging. The reception to some of these new features,

476
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,040
Speaker 7:  which were after all ripped from Tinder was a little bit

477
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,200
Speaker 7:  frosty. Lucy Mort again,

478
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,440
Speaker 22:  Yeah, it's like withholding pieces of the experience

479
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,920
Speaker 22:  and like dangling a carrot in front of a user but being like, mm,

480
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,200
Speaker 22:  pay us to get it. And I think that can feel like kind of shitty

481
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,800
Speaker 22:  as a user,

482
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,840
Speaker 24:  But it seems like these apps are improving on taking

483
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,800
Speaker 24:  our money and making us spend more time on their apps than

484
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,640
Speaker 24:  they are in, in actuality matching us with people that

485
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,600
Speaker 24:  we're more interested in. Right.

486
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,800
Speaker 7:  That's Jeremy. We're only using his first name because he works

487
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,410
Speaker 7:  as an app developer and wants to keep his job anyway.

488
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:29,250
Speaker 7:  Jeremy is one of the dozens of dating app users we talked to for this series.

489
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,690
Speaker 7:  He's skeptical of the effectiveness of Roses and the other

490
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,530
Speaker 7:  superpowers the app asks users to pay for.

491
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,090
Speaker 24:  I would never pay to send a rose to someone on Hinge and if I

492
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,970
Speaker 24:  did I, I wouldn't think that they'd be motivated to

493
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,650
Speaker 24:  match with me over someone else.

494
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,810
Speaker 7:  But Jeremy does pay for a Hinge subscription. It

495
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:55,770
Speaker 7:  lets him see people who have already liked him and that he says makes

496
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,700
Speaker 7:  things more efficient. But he's not sure. Efficiency has

497
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,060
Speaker 7:  helped him find what he's really looking for A partner

498
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,980
Speaker 7:  for Jeremy and many other users. It's not clear if buying all of

499
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,740
Speaker 7:  this extra stuff is working or if it's just throwing money into the void.

500
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,260
Speaker 7:  Sarah Satir is another dater. She diligently

501
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,460
Speaker 7:  uses her free rose every week.

502
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:23,180
Speaker 25:  I mean upwards for sure. If it's been

503
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,380
Speaker 25:  a year then I've given out 50,

504
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,660
Speaker 25:  but I do it every week. So however long it's existed, I've been doing it

505
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,180
Speaker 25:  once a week.

506
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,860
Speaker 7:  One person has responded to a Rose, she has sent

507
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,780
Speaker 7:  a guy who is thinking about moving to her city. They talked for months before

508
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,900
Speaker 7:  he arrived, but in person, the chemistry was non-existent.

509
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:46,140
Speaker 25:  I think I kept going out with him cuz I was like on paper, he is so perfect

510
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,860
Speaker 25:  and there's gotta be something here that I'm missing. I've gotta be able

511
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,260
Speaker 25:  to unlock the connection here and there just wasn't and I think that's the

512
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,380
Speaker 25:  thing you can't, you can't account for and you can't

513
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,700
Speaker 25:  app optimize for the connection. You just can't make that

514
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:00,700
Speaker 25:  a feature.

515
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:05,030
Speaker 7:  Edison Wilkinson also hasn't had luck with Roses.

516
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,710
Speaker 26:  Hinge does that like, oh my goodness, we know you'll be attracted to these

517
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,190
Speaker 26:  women and you have to like, you give them the one rose you get or pay

518
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,990
Speaker 26:  five bucks for a rose. Yes, absolutely. They do that for sure.

519
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,550
Speaker 7:  Have you paid to interact with those women?

520
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,110
Speaker 26:  Absolutely. For sure.

521
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,590
Speaker 26:  Absolutely, and nothing has come from it at all.

522
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,950
Speaker 26:  Fool me. One, shame on you, fool me twice. I need to get off this

523
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,270
Speaker 26:  app.

524
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:41,160
Speaker 7:  But that's not what's happening. People are staying on the app

525
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,040
Speaker 7:  and they're paying on the app. In 2020, hinge brought in

526
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,640
Speaker 7:  90 million in revenue. It nearly doubled the

527
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,520
Speaker 7:  following year. Hinge was making more from each paying user

528
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,040
Speaker 7:  too. In 2019, that was around $5 per month.

529
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:00,000
Speaker 7:  In 2022 it was 25. The value

530
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,760
Speaker 7:  proposition of these premium features is more efficiency, more

531
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,240
Speaker 7:  visibility, more likes, more, more,

532
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,920
Speaker 7:  more. But do they allow users to achieve their

533
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,960
Speaker 7:  romantic goals to find partners? I put the

534
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,000
Speaker 7:  question to Amna tore the Match Group executive. Do you

535
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,600
Speaker 7:  think those other features do

536
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,680
Speaker 7:  give people more success on the app?

537
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,880
Speaker 9:  Yes, they do. I mean like the obvious proof of that is that they're willing

538
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,000
Speaker 9:  to continue to pay for it because they see when they use it, they see

539
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,640
Speaker 9:  results and when they see more results, they want to buy it. Again,

540
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:40,080
Speaker 7:  Obvious proof is a stretch of the dozens of users

541
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,080
Speaker 7:  we spoke to, it seemed that what people were paying for was the

542
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,680
Speaker 7:  promise of results. Like spend enough and

543
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,520
Speaker 7:  surely they'll meet the right person eventually. I

544
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,320
Speaker 7:  wonder are the roses helping people find love? Is that what the data

545
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:55,760
Speaker 7:  is showing?

546
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,280
Speaker 9:  It is, it is. I mean, I think there's a stat on the app itself that like

547
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,520
Speaker 9:  once, if you send a Rose, you have a far higher chance of getting

548
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:06,040
Speaker 9:  a response and getting into a conversation. Then you don't,

549
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,110
Speaker 7:  That's not really what I asked, but former HIN

550
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:15,070
Speaker 7:  exec Tim, Matt Gin says matches moneymaking strategy.

551
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,830
Speaker 7:  While not perfect is a win for everyone, users

552
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,750
Speaker 2:  Want to go on dates. That's what the product is there to deliver. People

553
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,790
Speaker 2:  who pay for these things are getting incremental value, otherwise they wouldn't

554
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,910
Speaker 2:  pay for them. The roses that they're buying are working, the boosts they're

555
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:31,670
Speaker 2:  buying are working. The subscriptions that they're buying are working, they're

556
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:35,430
Speaker 2:  having a better experience and more dates. And if you want those things then

557
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:39,350
Speaker 2:  you can pay for them. You, you don't. Great. Functionally, I

558
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:43,030
Speaker 2:  can know that we took nothing away from the free experience when we introduced

559
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,150
Speaker 2:  them

560
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,710
Speaker 2:  and you know, a listener might believe me

561
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,190
Speaker 2:  or they might not. I don't know. It's a hard thing to prove. And

562
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,200
Speaker 2:  who trusts big corporations? You know,

563
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,480
Speaker 2:  if you assume that they're well-meaning and good, they wanna find

564
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,080
Speaker 2:  you, you're perfect match so that the more they know about you,

565
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,320
Speaker 2:  the more perfect partner they can show you.

566
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,240
Speaker 7:  Ev Gilbert, the lawyer we heard from earlier, doesn't think that

567
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,800
Speaker 7:  paying more for the apps means more success.

568
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,200
Speaker 2:  The less benevolent interpretation is that they're trying to find

569
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,040
Speaker 2:  a way to make more money off of you. So maybe

570
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,000
Speaker 2:  if they know who exactly you're attracted to, they're gonna give

571
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,880
Speaker 2:  you something that's the store brand diversion. So

572
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,600
Speaker 2:  you're like, okay, so the real one is out there. It's like

573
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,720
Speaker 2:  nibbling at the edges, but never getting the core.

574
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,840
Speaker 7:  We are sold on the idea that it's just a matter of time until that

575
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,640
Speaker 7:  special person sees our profile and swipes right

576
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,680
Speaker 7:  and paying for special features will supposedly shorten the process.

577
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:57,440
Speaker 2:  It felt like someone was trying to figure out what I liked, but it didn't

578
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,880
Speaker 2:  feel like they were trying to do that to help me in any way.

579
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,360
Speaker 7:  What did you do in terms of that? Like did that change your relationship

580
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,640
Speaker 7:  to the apps? Did you stop using them and you were pissed about it?

581
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:11,640
Speaker 2:  I I kept using them because what's the

582
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,200
Speaker 2:  alternative?

583
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,240
Speaker 7:  Lakshmi, welcome back. What did you think?

584
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,680
Speaker 8:  I take it that AV Gilbert does not pay for dating apps.

585
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,040
Speaker 7:  I don't think so. In his final year of law school, he actually wrote a

586
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,920
Speaker 7:  paper calling Match Group a monopoly.

587
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:35,600
Speaker 8:  It's like that moment when you realize Proctor and Gamble makes all of your

588
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,480
Speaker 8:  household products or that Rupert Murdoch is the hand behind a

589
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,840
Speaker 8:  lot of the news, but then you stop and think about dating apps,

590
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,840
Speaker 8:  you're hoping they'll help you find other humans to connect with, and then

591
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,280
Speaker 8:  you think they're run by a multi-billion dollar

592
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,920
Speaker 8:  corporation trying to keep its shareholders happy. That can be

593
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,360
Speaker 8:  concerning

594
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,320
Speaker 7:  Is this late stage capitalism at its finest?

595
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,520
Speaker 7:  Anything and truly everything has a price.

596
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,640
Speaker 8:  The thing that strikes me is our love lives are being steered by match

597
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,240
Speaker 8:  group's business objectives. So people are paying for all of these

598
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,520
