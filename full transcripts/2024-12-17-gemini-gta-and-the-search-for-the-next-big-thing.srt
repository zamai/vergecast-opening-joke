Description: The Verge's Victoria Song and Kylie Robison join the show to talk about all of Google's recent AI and XR announcements, and the company's big and Gemini-powered vision for the future of computing. Then Chris Grant, the group publisher for Polygon and The Verge, explains why GTA VI and the Nintendo Switch 2 are so important to the future of gaming — plus a few predictions about how they'll turn out. Finally, The Verge's Helen Havlak answers a hotline question about how she plans her garden in Figma. Which is a real thing she really does.

2
00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:07,075
Speaker 1:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Vaporware. I'm your friend

3
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:10,875
Speaker 1:  David Pierce, and I am almost done Christmas shopping as

4
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:14,795
Speaker 1:  I'm recording this. It is December 16th Monday, which means it is

5
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:18,315
Speaker 1:  nine days until Christmas. And if I'm being honest with you, it's a record

6
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:22,435
Speaker 1:  for how far in advance I'm done holiday shopping. I don't recommend living

7
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:26,075
Speaker 1:  this way, but here we are also thank you to everyone who sent in

8
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:30,035
Speaker 1:  recommendations for like cheap stuff to buy for acquaintances

9
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:33,675
Speaker 1:  and Secret Santa gifts. A bunch of you recommended power banks, which I think

10
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:37,515
Speaker 1:  is an awesome idea. So I'm getting a lot of people like nifty little batteries

11
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:41,435
Speaker 1:  to carry around. Also, some people recommended lottery scratchers. Super

12
00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:45,075
Speaker 1:  good idea. Candles was one that came up a bunch and I'm sort of

13
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:49,075
Speaker 1:  conflicted. Candles are awesome. I have them everywhere, but

14
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:53,475
Speaker 1:  is that like too intimate a gift to give to a semi

15
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:57,835
Speaker 1:  stranger or just a random person at work? I don't know, but I'm

16
00:00:57,835 --> 00:01:01,755
Speaker 1:  gonna try it. We'll see how it goes. Anyway, lots coming up on the show.

17
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:05,315
Speaker 1:  Today we are gonna do two things. This is our last Tuesday episode of the

18
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,555
Speaker 1:  year where you take a little break around the holidays, but we have a really

19
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:12,355
Speaker 1:  fun episode coming up today. First we're gonna talk about the

20
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:16,115
Speaker 1:  Google stuff from last week. Google made some big announcements about

21
00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:20,195
Speaker 1:  Gemini and AI and kind of showed off its

22
00:01:20,195 --> 00:01:23,435
Speaker 1:  entire vision for the future of everything in a way that I thought was really

23
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:27,435
Speaker 1:  fascinating. So we're gonna talk about that with V Song and Kylie

24
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:31,235
Speaker 1:  Robinson. And then we're gonna talk about video games. So Ash Parrish came

25
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:34,635
Speaker 1:  on the show a few weeks ago and said the biggest story in games this year

26
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:38,115
Speaker 1:  is two things that haven't launched yet, and I think that's fascinating.

27
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:41,715
Speaker 1:  So I asked Chris Grant, who is our group publisher and was the

28
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:45,565
Speaker 1:  editor-in-chief of Polygon, to come on and talk about what that means

29
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:49,205
Speaker 1:  and where we're headed and why. The biggest story in video games is two things

30
00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:53,045
Speaker 1:  that don't exist yet. All that is coming up in just a sec. But

31
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:57,045
Speaker 1:  first I have to tell you really quick before we take a break about our CES

32
00:01:57,045 --> 00:02:00,645
Speaker 1:  show. So on Wednesday, January 8th, if you're gonna be in Vegas for

33
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:04,165
Speaker 1:  CES, we are doing a live Vergecast at five o'clock

34
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,565
Speaker 1:  at the Brooklyn Bowl, which is at the Link Hotel, which is the one with the

35
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:10,205
Speaker 1:  big Ferris wheel, like right in the middle of the strip in Vegas.

36
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:15,005
Speaker 1:  It's gonna be free to come. Super exciting. We're gonna do some fun

37
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:18,565
Speaker 1:  stuff. It's like a weird, huge concert venue that is slightly

38
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:21,605
Speaker 1:  intimidating, but I think it's gonna be very fun. You should come out, put

39
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:24,405
Speaker 1:  it on your calendar, it's free, it's gonna be super fun. We would love to

40
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:28,245
Speaker 1:  see as many of you as we can in Vegas Wednesday, January 8th. I'll put

41
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:31,285
Speaker 1:  the link to the thing in the show notes. By the way, it says you have to

42
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:35,255
Speaker 1:  be a Sky Miles member to get in. Don't worry about that. We'll figure

43
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,735
Speaker 1:  it out. I'm not worried. It's gonna be fine. Anyway, come to the Vegas show,

44
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,575
Speaker 1:  come see us at CES. Very excited to hang out with all of you. Lots to get

45
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:45,695
Speaker 1:  to today. So let's just get into it. All that is coming up, we have to take

46
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:47,855
Speaker 1:  a break. This is the first cast, we'll be right

47
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,945
Speaker 1:  Welcome back. Alright, it is mid-December and there is still

48
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:47,945
Speaker 1:  AI news happening, which If you wanna know anything about what 2024 has been

49
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:51,825
Speaker 1:  like, there it is. Let's just get into it. So last

50
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,265
Speaker 1:  week Google, over the course of a couple of days, made a couple of different

51
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:58,745
Speaker 1:  announcements. It announced Gemini 2.0, its new

52
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,825
Speaker 1:  flagship AI model that is gonna kind of underpin everything that

53
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:06,545
Speaker 1:  Google's doing. And then the next day it announced Android xr, which is

54
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:10,705
Speaker 1:  basically Google trying to do for headsets and smart glasses,

55
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:14,185
Speaker 1:  what it did for smartphones. Somebody is going to be the big

56
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:18,225
Speaker 1:  cross-platform operating system that all the hardware makers use to make

57
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:22,105
Speaker 1:  these headsets and smart glasses. Google would very much like that

58
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:25,985
Speaker 1:  to be Google. So Android xr, Gemini 2.0 somewhere

59
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:29,985
Speaker 1:  in the combination of those two things I think is the future

60
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:33,905
Speaker 1:  of Google, or at least is what Google thinks is the future of Google. So

61
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:37,945
Speaker 1:  I asked two of the people who covered both sides of this v song and Kylie

62
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:40,745
Speaker 1:  Robinson to come on the show and the three of us are gonna try to figure

63
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:44,705
Speaker 1:  out how to put this Venn diagram of news together into

64
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:48,945
Speaker 1:  what Google is up to and thinks might be the future. So let's just get

65
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:52,625
Speaker 1:  into it. Fi song. Hello? Hello. Kylie

66
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:53,825
Speaker 1:  Robinson. Hello.

67
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:54,665
Speaker 2:  Hello.

68
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:58,975
Speaker 1:  Okay, I have brought the two of you here together because you have

69
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:02,855
Speaker 1:  had a rarefied experience individually,

70
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:06,855
Speaker 1:  which is that you got a wacky Google demo and there are

71
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:10,735
Speaker 1:  very few things in life as a tech journalist more fun than a

72
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:13,575
Speaker 1:  wacky Google demo in which you get walked through a bunch of stuff that might

73
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:17,215
Speaker 1:  not be real, it might not ship, it might not even be the thing that you thought

74
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:20,135
Speaker 1:  it was, but someone made it and they're really excited to show it to you.

75
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:24,935
Speaker 1:  And I also think between the two of you, you got like kind of

76
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:28,895
Speaker 1:  Google's whole vision for the future of everything. And So I just wanna like

77
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:32,695
Speaker 1:  see if we can put all of these pieces together between us. But

78
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:35,975
Speaker 1:  first, for the people who don't get to do these demos, I just want you to

79
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:39,295
Speaker 1:  both like explain the days you had with Google a little bit. Let's just do

80
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:40,935
Speaker 1:  it chronologically. Kylie, you go first.

81
00:06:41,545 --> 00:06:45,175
Speaker 4:  Sweet. Yeah, So I got to demo Project Astra and Project

82
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:48,975
Speaker 4:  Mariner. So they're both kind of agents.

83
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:53,055
Speaker 4:  I heard you say in the last VERGE cast that you think Project Astra is kind

84
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:55,695
Speaker 4:  of their whole vision for Gemini in the future.

85
00:06:56,995 --> 00:07:00,975
Speaker 4:  So I I would agree with that. Yeah, they locked me in a library

86
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:05,575
Speaker 4:  hidden on campus and they showed me a bunch of art on

87
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:09,855
Speaker 4:  TVs and they asked Astra to talk about that and

88
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,935
Speaker 4:  yeah, it was really excited to talk.

89
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:19,375
Speaker 4:  It would interrupt the speaker sometimes. She had a really bebo who

90
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:24,215
Speaker 4:  she was really excited to show me and the AI was more excited to, to be shown.

91
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,855
Speaker 4:  But yeah, you know, I got some on Rails demos. Something I

92
00:07:30,855 --> 00:07:34,575
Speaker 4:  didn't include in the story is they had this book, you know, about

93
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:37,895
Speaker 4:  France and then she flipped through the pages and asked it to remember

94
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:42,695
Speaker 4:  each page. And then she showed some wine that was

95
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:46,415
Speaker 4:  on the table and was like, okay, like for France's special

96
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:49,815
Speaker 4:  dish, you know, like their local dish, what wine should I pair with that?

97
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:54,495
Speaker 4:  The only reason I didn't include that is that I'm not a France expert and

98
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:58,655
Speaker 4:  I contacted Nathan Edwards on staff who said he was semi a

99
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:01,855
Speaker 4:  France expert and neither of us could deduce how helpful that was.

100
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:06,935
Speaker 4:  Fair enough. And then Project Mariner is just like a typical

101
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:11,335
Speaker 4:  agent, a Chrome extension that you know,

102
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:14,655
Speaker 4:  can go through your grocery list and buy stuff for you. It just takes over

103
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:18,175
Speaker 4:  your web browser. It was really slow, but both were really

104
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:21,895
Speaker 4:  interesting to see even as research prototypes, just kind of how they're

105
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:24,815
Speaker 4:  thinking about the technology. But as I mentioned in the article when you

106
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:28,095
Speaker 4:  just mentioned a second ago, like they're like, we don't know what this will

107
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:31,695
Speaker 4:  look like and if, if or when this will ever launch. And I'm like, cool. Awesome.

108
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:35,735
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I, one thing I always wonder is like Google demos exist on

109
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:39,655
Speaker 1:  a spectrum between like, here's a thing a person built

110
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:42,975
Speaker 1:  that we thought was neat and figured we'd show you all the way up to like,

111
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:46,655
Speaker 1:  this is the product that will take us into the future. Sure.

112
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:51,055
Speaker 1:  Where on the spectrum do you feel like these demos were like, where

113
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:52,655
Speaker 1:  is this stuff within Google right now?

114
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:57,565
Speaker 4:  Astra is, this will take us into the future. Okay. And Mariner

115
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:01,725
Speaker 4:  is, there's, it's so new that I think it's not gonna be the future

116
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:05,685
Speaker 4:  product yet. So yeah, I I would say that's, that's we're both fall.

117
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:08,405
Speaker 1:  They just like found a thing that can open a new tab in Chrome and like got

118
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:09,045
Speaker 1:  really excited about it.

119
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:10,285
Speaker 4:  Right, exactly. That

120
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:14,085
Speaker 1:  Feels like as far as we've gotten. Yeah. Right. Okay. All right. V your turn.

121
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:17,605
Speaker 1:  Tell us, you, you got to play with hardware, which means you got Yes. The

122
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:21,525
Speaker 1:  even weirder experience of having a bunch of Google employees watch you

123
00:09:21,825 --> 00:09:25,725
Speaker 1:  use a gadget, which is the literal worst thing. So tell

124
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:27,285
Speaker 1:  me a little bit about your demo Google

125
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:32,005
Speaker 5:  And Samsung employees. Hmm. So it was a, there were at times

126
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,885
Speaker 5:  where I had a whole crowd of people just staring at me and that was uncomfortable,

127
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:39,605
Speaker 5:  especially because, So I got to demo Android at XR

128
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:44,005
Speaker 5:  and you know, when you are in XR short for

129
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:48,005
Speaker 5:  extended reality, which encompasses augmented reality, virtual reality and

130
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,805
Speaker 5:  mixed reality, all these levels of reality,

131
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:55,965
Speaker 5:  you're basically in a headset. So you

132
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:59,885
Speaker 5:  can't see people necessarily depending on the demo, but

133
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:03,445
Speaker 5:  they're all just staring at you walk around a room, right? Just like,

134
00:10:03,945 --> 00:10:04,165
Speaker 5:  ooh.

135
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:08,205
Speaker 1:  The worst version of this, by the way, is the Vision Pro demos where people

136
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:12,165
Speaker 1:  just sort of mysteriously appear in your vision and then slowly fade

137
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:12,845
Speaker 1:  away. And this

138
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,965
Speaker 5:  Was a little like that. Yeah. My god, this was a little like that. Oh no.

139
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:19,925
Speaker 5:  Because, yeah, So I got to try Android xr, which is the

140
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:23,885
Speaker 5:  broad platform, but they basically want this to be a single platform

141
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:27,925
Speaker 5:  for multiple devices, which meant I got to try Samsung's.

142
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:31,045
Speaker 5:  You're gonna love what this is called. Project Moan.

143
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:35,765
Speaker 5:  Headset. No thank you. And some Prototype

144
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:39,805
Speaker 5:  Smart glasses. So basically two different visions

145
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:43,125
Speaker 5:  for what XR is gonna look like. Project Moan,

146
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:47,965
Speaker 5:  moan being Infinity in Korean, I don't

147
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:51,485
Speaker 5:  know why they just didn't call it Project Infinity, but here you go, right.

148
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:55,325
Speaker 5:  Project Wuhan is basically a Samsung and Google

149
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:59,205
Speaker 5:  flavored version of the Vision Pro to the point where like everything I was

150
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:02,885
Speaker 5:  doing in it, I was like, ah, this eye calibration and

151
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:07,005
Speaker 5:  pinchy pinchy UI seems awfully

152
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:11,125
Speaker 5:  familiar in that it is exactly the same as as the pro.

153
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,805
Speaker 5:  And you know, they're showing me things like, oh you can tap this button

154
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:18,925
Speaker 5:  and go into an immersive environment to watch your movies. And

155
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:22,725
Speaker 5:  instead of saying on Apple TV, they said Google tv. And it was like

156
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:26,845
Speaker 5:  that level of like almost one-to-one for some of the things I saw,

157
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:29,725
Speaker 5:  which, you know, when we all saw the Vision Pro demos last year, we were

158
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:32,605
Speaker 5:  like, oh my God, wow, this is really impressive. So it's impressive that

159
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:36,405
Speaker 5:  they're able to do that and all of that whatnot. But yeah,

160
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:40,405
Speaker 5:  it was like Google Flavored Vision Pro that demo and then the Smart

161
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:44,325
Speaker 5:  Glasses was really cool because I, I felt like Tony

162
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,925
Speaker 5:  Stark, but like the whole thing behind all of that and what makes it kind

163
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:51,365
Speaker 5:  of AI related is that they're saying Gemini is the key to

164
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:55,205
Speaker 5:  unlocking XR forever, right? This is, this is the killer

165
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:58,845
Speaker 5:  app, Gemini is the killer app. And then, you know, I got

166
00:11:59,505 --> 00:12:03,005
Speaker 5:  walked through a bunch of very impressive demos, frankly, but like on

167
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,045
Speaker 5:  guardrails. So they were all very sure that this was gonna work. And yet

168
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:10,405
Speaker 5:  at the same time, every single time I would say something and asked Gemini

169
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:14,325
Speaker 5:  something for the demo to work, they would just be like holding their breaths

170
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:17,765
Speaker 5:  and then when it did work they would just like breathe like audibly. Like

171
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:21,765
Speaker 5:  okay, okay, very cool. Very, very awesome, very cool. And like

172
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,005
Speaker 1:  They're like, we totally meant for that to happen. That was definitely really

173
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:26,845
Speaker 5:  Fun. We hope, thank God, thank God that, that, that worked. Because you know,

174
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:29,485
Speaker 5:  they would say something to me like, oh you know, you can switch between

175
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:32,805
Speaker 5:  different languages when you're talking to Gemini and it'll answer you in

176
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:36,765
Speaker 5:  the language that you asked it. And I was like, okay cool. Can

177
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:39,925
Speaker 5:  I try this out? And So I started speaking in Japanese and they were like,

178
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:43,805
Speaker 5:  yeah, it'll totally work. Oh my God, it works. Like that kind of,

179
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,285
Speaker 5:  that kind of energy that was happening in there.

180
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:50,685
Speaker 1:  So I feel like on the, on the spectrum of here's the thing somebody made,

181
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:53,805
Speaker 1:  do you wanna look at it too? This will lead us into the future. I feel like

182
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:56,765
Speaker 1:  all the Android XR stuff is like way down at the, this will lead us into

183
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:59,765
Speaker 1:  the future end, right? Like Google seems to really believe in this whole

184
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:00,005
Speaker 1:  project.

185
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I don't know how far into the future like Project

186
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:08,685
Speaker 5:  Moan that. So they were very adamant that everything I was seeing was a

187
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:12,325
Speaker 5:  dev kit and that they were rolling everything out to devs so that

188
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:16,605
Speaker 5:  there would be a robust ecosystem of apps and experiences by

189
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:20,085
Speaker 5:  the time it hits consumers. You know, taking very vague pot shots

190
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:23,685
Speaker 5:  at how Apple just threw the Vision Pro at us without

191
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:26,245
Speaker 5:  a lot of apps to work with. Listen,

192
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,165
Speaker 1:  It had iPad apps and that didn't help anyone for any reason, but it

193
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,925
Speaker 1:  had them the, they were there.

194
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:34,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. So,

195
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:38,605
Speaker 5:  so you know, they were very like keen to be like, oh yeah, you know, you'll

196
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:42,125
Speaker 5:  be able to use all these Google Play apps out of the box when Project Wuhan

197
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:46,045
Speaker 5:  arrives in 2025. So that will be coming

198
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:50,085
Speaker 5:  next year ostensibly, whether they mean January or

199
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:54,205
Speaker 5:  December, probably closer to December is my guess. And then

200
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:58,645
Speaker 5:  the prototype glasses I saw were like super duper cool. All the

201
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:02,485
Speaker 5:  demos I saw on that. Totally. Like I'm a huge smart glasses

202
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:06,045
Speaker 5:  skeptic and I have been, If you look through the whole body of my work and

203
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:10,005
Speaker 5:  I felt myself like kind of believing, understanding that everything

204
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:12,965
Speaker 5:  was on guardrails of course. But then you know, you talk about like, okay,

205
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:15,365
Speaker 5:  so when are we gonna see these front glasses on people? And they're like,

206
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:19,085
Speaker 5:  well we're making the prototypes but we will be working with partners for

207
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:22,525
Speaker 5:  the hardware to actually come out. So like I know X reel is working with

208
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:25,565
Speaker 5:  them, but as to when we'll actually see that

209
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:30,245
Speaker 5:  ah, it's gonna be in the future

210
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:31,925
Speaker 5:  is is what it's gonna be.

211
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:35,045
Speaker 1:  Yeah. The future is a long time. Yeah.

212
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:35,725
Speaker 5:  Kylie,

213
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:39,725
Speaker 1:  This thing about the killer app for AI being glasses, I think

214
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:42,405
Speaker 1:  it's really fascinating because it seems to work in both directions. Everybody

215
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:46,305
Speaker 1:  who is making glasses thinks that AI is going to be what makes the glasses

216
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:50,185
Speaker 1:  great and everybody making AI thinks that glasses are like

217
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:53,925
Speaker 1:  the natural interface for it in so many ways. Like

218
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:57,965
Speaker 1:  Google is completely bought into this idea, right? That like Gemini on your

219
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:01,745
Speaker 1:  face is going to be the best possible version of Gemini. Does everybody believe

220
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:05,185
Speaker 1:  this? Like are are smart glasses and and AI just going to smush together

221
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:05,985
Speaker 1:  across the whole industry?

222
00:15:07,245 --> 00:15:10,505
Speaker 4:  No. Okay. Short answer, no.

223
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:14,785
Speaker 4:  I think it's been reported that Sam Altman's working with Johnny Ive on earbuds,

224
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:18,745
Speaker 4:  you know, so that's one way to go about it in terms of integrating AI into

225
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:22,705
Speaker 4:  the physical world and what we do with it. Glasses

226
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:25,705
Speaker 4:  is a really compelling use case. However, you have said on The Verge cast,

227
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:29,465
Speaker 4:  and I hear this all the time, that glasses are annoying and I hear people

228
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:33,305
Speaker 4:  saying, I want to like it, but I hate wearing them and I'm sympathetic,

229
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:36,905
Speaker 4:  however, I've always worn glasses, so I'm, my entire life I'm used to them

230
00:15:37,085 --> 00:15:39,785
Speaker 1:  And you don't need them. They're just purely an affectation. You just Exactly.

231
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:40,945
Speaker 1:  You just wear them 'cause they look cool. Right?

232
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:42,545
Speaker 4:  Right. Do I look cool? Oh

233
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:43,425
Speaker 5:  My god,

234
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:45,585
Speaker 1:  I'm So, I didn't say you jealous

235
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:48,185
Speaker 5:  Right now because I'm wearing contacts

236
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,705
Speaker 5:  I have to have corrective vision so I'm jealous.

237
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:56,945
Speaker 1:  Yeah. V is well documented as, as more or less blind here on the first

238
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:57,185
Speaker 1:  cast.

239
00:15:57,425 --> 00:16:00,985
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no, I'm negative 2.5 negative 3.5. But that, I don't think that's blind

240
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:03,905
Speaker 4:  enough. I think my mom's negative six in both eyes, which is pretty blind

241
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:08,025
Speaker 5:  Negative nine, negative 8.75 with heavy

242
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:08,945
Speaker 4:  Damn

243
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:12,705
Speaker 5:  Heav astigmatism babies. Yeah.

244
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:16,905
Speaker 4:  Love that. For the meta ray bands, you

245
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:20,025
Speaker 4:  I think negative six and above you, they can't help you like you're

246
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:23,585
Speaker 5:  Screwed. No, no. The honest to God they, when they sent me my prescription

247
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:27,185
Speaker 5:  ones, they're like, just so you know, we did this like out of house because

248
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:31,065
Speaker 5:  Ray van wouldn't do it. Yep. 'cause you're so blind. Yep.

249
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:34,345
Speaker 5:  I appreciated it. But it was also just like

250
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:36,105
Speaker 1:  You're breaking the curve V as always.

251
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:39,585
Speaker 4:  Love that. Yeah. Yeah. But so no, I think a lot of people

252
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:43,705
Speaker 4:  are not interested in it. I still think it should be built and I still think

253
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:47,025
Speaker 4:  it's really cool and I am happy to use them, but I don't think it'll be like

254
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:50,225
Speaker 4:  the killer version of this. I think they're gonna have to keep iterating

255
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:54,065
Speaker 4:  and hardware is hard. I'd be interested to see how earbuds, if that

256
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:56,465
Speaker 4:  ever drops, that's gonna be very interesting to see.

257
00:16:57,205 --> 00:17:00,665
Speaker 5:  So like a really interesting conversation I had with Google and

258
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:04,665
Speaker 5:  Samsung while I was there is that they did not seem

259
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:08,385
Speaker 5:  to buy into this whole idea that it'll be one hardware device

260
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:12,625
Speaker 5:  that conquers everything, where that is the key. It was like they were

261
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,585
Speaker 5:  saying like, oh well, you know, VR headsets, those are gonna be episodic.

262
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:18,785
Speaker 5:  Those are things for like when you want immersive content, when you want

263
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:22,825
Speaker 5:  the 500 foot TV screen on the whatever smart

264
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:25,985
Speaker 5:  glasses are gonna be when you feel like you wanna be on the go and discrete.

265
00:17:25,985 --> 00:17:29,945
Speaker 5:  But that may not be something that you do all the time. So I think the

266
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:33,345
Speaker 5:  way they're approaching it is an ecosystem of devices, which you know,

267
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:37,865
Speaker 5:  is great for spending money and trapping you into these

268
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:40,625
Speaker 5:  silos of gadget ecosystems. But I think to your point,

269
00:17:40,815 --> 00:17:41,305
Speaker 4:  Consume,

270
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:45,465
Speaker 5:  Yes, to your point, I think not everyone's gonna want the glasses form factor,

271
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:49,445
Speaker 5:  but that form factor is gonna give some advantages that an

272
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:53,205
Speaker 5:  earbud can't. And that I think in the the future

273
00:17:53,235 --> 00:17:56,965
Speaker 5:  they're pitching we'll all have incredible disposable

274
00:17:56,965 --> 00:18:00,805
Speaker 5:  income to have 40,000 different gadgets for different use cases. Love it.

275
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:02,165
Speaker 5:  Right. So yeah.

276
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:06,325
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean I think I I, I'm of two minds about the glasses thing. As

277
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,805
Speaker 1:  somebody who does not wear glasses. 'cause my vision is sick. Like, not to

278
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:10,805
Speaker 1:  brag, but like all right,

279
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:13,285
Speaker 5:  It's pretty okay, fine. Yeah. Okay.

280
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:17,085
Speaker 1:  I have like some of the best people are always saying I have like the best

281
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:20,245
Speaker 1:  vision. The people are saying people are, a lot of people are saying that,

282
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:25,245
Speaker 1:  but I think on the one hand the idea of like wearing

283
00:18:25,245 --> 00:18:29,005
Speaker 1:  glasses I don't otherwise need for like

284
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:32,685
Speaker 1:  pure utility reasons I think is just never gonna happen. Yeah. I think there's

285
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:36,645
Speaker 1:  a world in which like they are a fashion item and people wear them

286
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:40,645
Speaker 1:  in part because they look cool even when you need them. Like correctively.

287
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:43,525
Speaker 1:  But then somebody pointed out to me recently, they were like, okay, when

288
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:47,465
Speaker 1:  you have sunglasses and you aren't wearing them, where do you put

289
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:50,705
Speaker 1:  them? And I was like, oh, well I put 'em in my like coat pocket or I put

290
00:18:50,785 --> 00:18:53,465
Speaker 1:  'em on top of my head or I like fold 'em up and put 'em in my shirt. And

291
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,105
Speaker 1:  they were like, yeah, that's fine. That's like, that becomes a use case that

292
00:18:57,305 --> 00:19:00,705
Speaker 1:  actually works. And it's, it's a thing you can both carry around and put

293
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:03,825
Speaker 1:  on in a bunch of ways. And actually that ends up being really useful. I had

294
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:06,145
Speaker 1:  this moment of being like, oh, maybe there's something to that, that actually

295
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,105
Speaker 1:  glasses are more able to be taken on and off than I

296
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:13,945
Speaker 1:  was giving them credit for. But then for the huge percentage of people who

297
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,385
Speaker 1:  need them correctively, that doesn't work at all because you're gonna have

298
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:20,185
Speaker 1:  to wear them day in and day out and Yeah. Like, I don't know. Did,

299
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:24,225
Speaker 1:  did either of you talk to Google about this idea of like, what happens

300
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:27,625
Speaker 1:  if we wear these things all day every day? Are you just going to shove ads

301
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,505
Speaker 1:  in my face? Is the future just giant ar billboards in

302
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,065
Speaker 1:  front of me all the time while I wear the glasses that I need to live my

303
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:34,225
Speaker 1:  life?

304
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:37,745
Speaker 5:  They're very adamant that that's like not what they're building towards.

305
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:41,465
Speaker 5:  And from what I saw in the prototypes that I saw, like that's gonna be very

306
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:42,385
Speaker 5:  hard to do. Okay. Because

307
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:47,955
Speaker 5:  you know, like the science fiction of it, like I, I talk like a lot in

308
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:51,795
Speaker 5:  past stuff that I've done just about how science fiction really forms

309
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:55,795
Speaker 5:  our perception of what these things will look like. Right. So

310
00:19:56,105 --> 00:19:59,795
Speaker 5:  Tony Stark is the example that gets pulled out all the time. Yep. And with

311
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:03,715
Speaker 5:  Tony Stark in his smart glasses, like in that, or the ones that he

312
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:07,555
Speaker 5:  gives to Peter Parker in one of those Marvel movies, which

313
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:11,515
Speaker 5:  his name is escaping me right now. Like the, the display moves

314
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:15,435
Speaker 5:  around, right. It's like a dynamic display. The whole lens is a

315
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:19,315
Speaker 5:  display and that's just like not where we are. So they were very excited

316
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:22,155
Speaker 5:  to show me these prototypes and they're like, oh, this one prototype you're

317
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:25,915
Speaker 5:  gonna see, it's a monocular display, which means it's off to the side.

318
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,155
Speaker 5:  It's, it's only in one area off to the side. Okay. And then they were like,

319
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:33,275
Speaker 5:  but oh, try this prototype and it's binocular. What

320
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:36,835
Speaker 5:  do you notice about that? And so that's like a display in both of the lenses

321
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,875
Speaker 5:  and it's a little more centrally located, but because of how small the

322
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:44,435
Speaker 5:  display is, like you're not really seeing billboards everywhere.

323
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:45,595
Speaker 5:  You're seeing like

324
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:51,035
Speaker 5:  one area and it's changing based on your use case.

325
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:54,555
Speaker 5:  So like a notification pops up. It's not like you're seeing like

326
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:58,715
Speaker 5:  everything overlaid in a minority report type way. It's like one

327
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:02,595
Speaker 5:  notification in one area and you can see it and it's small. Or

328
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:06,595
Speaker 5:  like one of the really cool things I saw was turn by turn directions for

329
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:09,635
Speaker 5:  Google Maps and you're like, oh, you see a little bubble and it tells you

330
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:13,435
Speaker 5:  the direction and If you look down then it becomes a zoomable map. Like

331
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:15,155
Speaker 5:  you have to look down though to see it.

332
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:20,555
Speaker 5:  And I was like, interesting. And that was because they actually don't want

333
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:24,475
Speaker 5:  you to have ar directions that are so distracting when you're walking

334
00:21:24,475 --> 00:21:27,715
Speaker 5:  around that you can't be aware of your surroundings. 'cause that's a safety,

335
00:21:27,715 --> 00:21:31,595
Speaker 5:  right. A public safety issue. So it's a dystopian

336
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:34,835
Speaker 5:  nightmare to think about. I think about that short film, I forget the name

337
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,795
Speaker 5:  of it that came out a long time ago. Yeah. Where the person was on a

338
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:42,715
Speaker 5:  bus and it was just like ads everywhere and like, oh my God, just wanna

339
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:46,555
Speaker 5:  die seeing that. But I think in reality

340
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:51,275
Speaker 5:  no one would enjoy that. And then I say this about wearables all the

341
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:54,765
Speaker 5:  time, you have to want to wear them. That's the only way

342
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:59,325
Speaker 5:  that technology works. So if no one wants to wear these because the experience

343
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:03,205
Speaker 5:  is so bad full of those ads, that's just, you know, I think they're,

344
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:07,165
Speaker 5:  I asked them, they were aware of it and they tried to very much be like,

345
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:08,925
Speaker 5:  no, no, no, no, we're not gonna do that.

346
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:12,485
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So it's an easy thing to say I think. Very easy.

347
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:12,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

348
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:15,645
Speaker 1:  But it is at least, it at least, at least something I'm hap I would rather

349
00:22:15,645 --> 00:22:17,925
Speaker 1:  them say that than the other thing. Right. Which is like, this is such a

350
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:21,805
Speaker 1:  sick place to put ads. Like, all right, cool. Kylie, what

351
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:25,245
Speaker 1:  did you, what sense did you get? 'cause I think one of the things Google

352
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:28,405
Speaker 1:  is pretty clearly pushing towards with something like Mariners, like making

353
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:31,605
Speaker 1:  it really easy to shop for things. Yeah. Which is one heck of a way to make

354
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:35,485
Speaker 1:  money and Astra is, is super visual and is a way to

355
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:38,485
Speaker 1:  like see the world through your phone and glasses and there's all kinds of

356
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:41,485
Speaker 1:  stuff you could do there. Do you get a sense of like

357
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:46,045
Speaker 1:  Google trying to sort of sneakily find ways to turn this stuff

358
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:48,085
Speaker 1:  into money here? Of course. Or am I just being cynical?

359
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,005
Speaker 4:  No, of course. I once again was listening to The Vergecast that just came

360
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:55,725
Speaker 4:  out and you had mentioned that like agents are a way for them to

361
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:59,365
Speaker 4:  like, please we need money. Like we need an application for these really

362
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:02,645
Speaker 4:  expensive models. And this seems to be one of those applications. And I wrote

363
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:06,445
Speaker 4:  about that a couple months ago, that AI agents are what everyone's creating.

364
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:09,405
Speaker 4:  It's what they desperately need. 'cause they need to charge money for something

365
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:13,365
Speaker 4:  that is useful and they just haven't been able to figure out those

366
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:16,605
Speaker 4:  applications yet. And this is something I've been thinking about largely

367
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:20,445
Speaker 4:  for 2025, is that it's going to look like to me,

368
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:25,205
Speaker 4:  everyone trying to find those applications for these frontier models. Whether

369
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:28,525
Speaker 4:  that's internally or people tinkering with the models and building their

370
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:32,405
Speaker 4:  own wrappers. You know, I think agents, honestly,

371
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:36,365
Speaker 4:  like when I was doing those demos, I did get a sense of like,

372
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:40,205
Speaker 4:  oof, this is coming really fast. Like I, I felt,

373
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:44,445
Speaker 4:  you know, my brain kind of spinning a little bit because, and this is something

374
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:48,325
Speaker 4:  I was telling them too, is that OpenAI loves to say, we don't wanna shock

375
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:51,045
Speaker 4:  everybody and drop everything too soon before they're ready. And you're like,

376
00:23:51,045 --> 00:23:52,605
Speaker 4:  yeah, right man, okay, whatever.

377
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:54,925
Speaker 1:  That's actually your favorite thing to do. Yeah,

378
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:58,005
Speaker 4:  Exactly. So like, we don't wanna like, you know, freak people out 'cause

379
00:23:58,005 --> 00:24:01,365
Speaker 4:  it's so powerful. However, when I was doing these like research prototypes,

380
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:04,365
Speaker 4:  I was like, oof, like this is actually kind of giving me vertigo. This is

381
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:07,885
Speaker 4:  like, this could be a lot to unleash into the world.

382
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:09,005
Speaker 5:  I had that too.

383
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:12,325
Speaker 1:  How so what was it, what was it that happened that made you feel like that?

384
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,685
Speaker 4:  I think it was just the ways that it could be used

385
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:20,845
Speaker 4:  nefariously. It's, it's obviously not that smart and

386
00:24:20,845 --> 00:24:24,565
Speaker 4:  it's very slow, so like that's why it's not out yet. But

387
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:28,405
Speaker 4:  I don't know, I just haven't seen something like this yet in the wild,

388
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:31,925
Speaker 4:  something that takes control over my browser and like with natural language,

389
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:35,405
Speaker 4:  like just a few years ago when I was covering software dev culture, the big

390
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:39,045
Speaker 4:  thing was no code, low-code. So you could like use natural language to program.

391
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:42,765
Speaker 4:  And I'm like, wow, that's really cool. And now we're using natural language

392
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:46,605
Speaker 4:  to control our web browser and shop for us. Like, you know, obviously

393
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:49,565
Speaker 4:  I'm going to just say that this is vaporware, it's not out, you know, it's

394
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:53,365
Speaker 4:  research prototype, whatever. But just seeing the demo, you're like, wow,

395
00:24:53,365 --> 00:24:57,285
Speaker 4:  this is, this feels like some huge leaps, you know,

396
00:24:57,305 --> 00:24:58,805
Speaker 4:  we don't know when it's coming out, but

397
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:03,005
Speaker 5:  The natural language thing, it really shocks you when it does work. Yeah.

398
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:06,565
Speaker 5:  'cause I had, they, they were like really pushing that as like, why Gemini

399
00:25:06,565 --> 00:25:10,445
Speaker 5:  is gonna be a killer thing. Because you can just go like, show me a video

400
00:25:10,585 --> 00:25:14,405
Speaker 5:  of X, Y, Z and it'll automatically open the YouTube app and the thing without

401
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:18,245
Speaker 5:  you asking like what the app is and like that's like oh, oh, oh,

402
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:21,205
Speaker 5:  okay. But like, I had a moment like you did where I was like, oh no. Oh,

403
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:24,725
Speaker 5:  oh no, we are not ready for this. Yeah. Because they, they were basically

404
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:28,325
Speaker 5:  like, I was in the glasses and they were like, oh, why don't you ask Gemini

405
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:31,445
Speaker 5:  what the title of the yellow book behind you is? And I'm not looking at it

406
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:35,645
Speaker 5:  and I ask and because it had seen it before. Yeah. I didn't take a picture

407
00:25:35,705 --> 00:25:39,525
Speaker 5:  of it. It was able to tell me the title of the, the book behind me.

408
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:42,845
Speaker 5:  Oh wow. And then I take the book and they're like, why don't, why don't you

409
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:46,645
Speaker 5:  ask open to a random page. Why don't you ask Gemini to summarize

410
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:50,645
Speaker 5:  what's on on the page for you? And I'm not taking pictures like

411
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:54,405
Speaker 5:  I would with a meta ray bands. I'm just looking. And it goes like, oh, okay,

412
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:58,565
Speaker 5:  well what this page is about is about the nexus of AI networks and blah,

413
00:25:58,565 --> 00:26:02,125
Speaker 5:  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it's, I was just like, oh no. College

414
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:05,965
Speaker 5:  professors and teachers everywhere are cooked because students are

415
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:09,685
Speaker 5:  just gonna take textbooks and just like, go summarize this for me and, and

416
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:10,405
Speaker 5:  whatnot. So

417
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:15,005
Speaker 1:  A thing that has started creeping onto my TikTok for you page a lot

418
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:19,165
Speaker 1:  is college students like giving tips on how

419
00:26:19,185 --> 00:26:23,045
Speaker 1:  to do exactly what you just described. Like here's this cool new tool where

420
00:26:23,045 --> 00:26:26,805
Speaker 1:  you can upload the, the PDF that we have to read for this week and

421
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:29,885
Speaker 1:  it'll give you this summary and these flashcards and it just, and it's just

422
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:33,645
Speaker 1:  like this is just presented as if it's like, you know, how to

423
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:37,405
Speaker 1:  access your email address and it's just like, oh my God. Like what, what

424
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:40,805
Speaker 1:  are we supposed to do with this dude? Yeah. But this is, this is one of the

425
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:43,325
Speaker 1:  things I, I've been thinking about this for forever. Like, you, you guys

426
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:45,925
Speaker 1:  I'm sure have heard the thing that Google always says about like, you know,

427
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:49,285
Speaker 1:  15% of Google searches are new every day. Like,

428
00:26:50,135 --> 00:26:53,605
Speaker 1:  which is wild given how big Google is and how long it's been around. But

429
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:57,445
Speaker 1:  like this thing that everybody has been promising us with AI is that it is

430
00:26:57,445 --> 00:27:01,085
Speaker 1:  going to like, completely change how we use technology.

431
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:05,445
Speaker 1:  And I think the thing that I have spent too much time thinking about

432
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:09,405
Speaker 1:  is like how I'm gonna replace all the stuff that I normally do. And so far

433
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:12,405
Speaker 1:  the answer is AI doesn't really replace any of that very successfully. But

434
00:27:12,405 --> 00:27:15,485
Speaker 1:  this question of like, can it, are there going to be new things and like

435
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:19,365
Speaker 1:  new questions we can ask and new ways to do stuff that feels like

436
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:22,805
Speaker 1:  where this gets really interesting and like, what's the title of that yellow

437
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:26,685
Speaker 1:  book behind me is like, not a real use case. That's not a no. No one ever

438
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:28,045
Speaker 1:  needs to do that in real life.

439
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:29,605
Speaker 4:  It's a good magic trick or party.

440
00:27:29,705 --> 00:27:30,605
Speaker 5:  The magic trick. It's a good magic trick.

441
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:33,805
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But like, just the other day, so there's a, there's a bookstore like

442
00:27:33,845 --> 00:27:36,165
Speaker 1:  a mile from my house that's going outta business. And so everything that

443
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:39,805
Speaker 1:  they're selling is half off. And we were in there the other night and wound

444
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:42,725
Speaker 1:  up having to like, run out before we left. But I was reading the inside of

445
00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:45,805
Speaker 1:  a book, like just the, the book jacket. And I was like, oh, this sounds cool.

446
00:27:45,805 --> 00:27:49,285
Speaker 1:  It's like a super spy thriller. Maybe I'll buy this, cannot remember the

447
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:51,245
Speaker 1:  title of it. And if I could just be like, what was the name of that book

448
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:54,585
Speaker 1:  I was looking at the other day in the bookstore? Like, that's the stuff,

449
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:58,105
Speaker 1:  right? Like that actually is like a sincerely useful thing to have in my

450
00:27:58,105 --> 00:28:01,865
Speaker 1:  life. And ha the question for me is how far

451
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:05,705
Speaker 1:  we are from that kind of stuff. And again, it seems like the things you're

452
00:28:05,705 --> 00:28:08,555
Speaker 1:  seeing in these demos are like, not,

453
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:11,935
Speaker 1:  they're not products, but they're, they're also something more than like

454
00:28:12,385 --> 00:28:15,975
Speaker 1:  ideas. And So I like how I'm, I don't know, I'm

455
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,175
Speaker 1:  sequencing all this stuff in my brain trying to figure out like, when is

456
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:21,295
Speaker 1:  this all gonna actually work? And it gets harder and harder to figure out.

457
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:24,895
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It shows that they're capable of building it. I mean, they have built

458
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:28,375
Speaker 4:  something that I am seeing with my own eyes that is working in some

459
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:32,535
Speaker 4:  capacity. So it's like the, the first like step into, you know, and

460
00:28:32,535 --> 00:28:36,295
Speaker 4:  I don't know when we'll get this, I don't know when it'll be, you know, it's,

461
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:40,295
Speaker 4:  it's, it's scary. Like it genu it genuinely is scary. Yeah. And IG and you

462
00:28:40,295 --> 00:28:43,535
Speaker 4:  were talking about those tiktoks earlier made me think like, is this what

463
00:28:43,595 --> 00:28:47,015
Speaker 4:  people felt like, you know, when kids started using the internet for the

464
00:28:47,015 --> 00:28:50,535
Speaker 4:  first time, it can't be, this just makes me feel a little sick sometimes.

465
00:28:51,235 --> 00:28:55,175
Speaker 1:  Oh no, it's super Is it is. There is like the,

466
00:28:55,195 --> 00:28:58,695
Speaker 1:  the thing that gives me hope is that this is the same kind of thing we've

467
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,255
Speaker 1:  gone through with every technical development ever. Right.

468
00:29:02,795 --> 00:29:05,975
Speaker 1:  And, you know, whatever kids are growing up not learning how to read. So

469
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:09,735
Speaker 1:  like the, the internet did do that. Yay. So here we are, but, but we,

470
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,815
Speaker 1:  we soldier on. So v coming out of all

471
00:29:13,815 --> 00:29:17,335
Speaker 1:  these demos, do you buy this big thesis from Google that like Gemini

472
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:20,855
Speaker 1:  unlocks the face, wearables for the future?

473
00:29:22,535 --> 00:29:26,135
Speaker 5:  I, what I'll say is like knowing that my demos were

474
00:29:26,135 --> 00:29:29,055
Speaker 5:  incredibly controlled, right? They didn't even let me take pictures of anything

475
00:29:29,695 --> 00:29:33,575
Speaker 5:  knowing that, seeing everything working. Did I feel like Tony

476
00:29:33,665 --> 00:29:37,655
Speaker 5:  Stark and that Gemini was my Jarvis? Yes. That was really

477
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:40,255
Speaker 5:  freaking, yeah, I did, it felt very scary. Okay.

478
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:43,245
Speaker 1:  And that's something, I mean, 'cause you, you were a person who I'm a huge

479
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:46,165
Speaker 1:  skeptic, spent a lot of time in Division Pro and kind of every time came

480
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:48,845
Speaker 1:  out of it being like, what is any of this actually doing for me? Yeah. So

481
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:51,605
Speaker 1:  the fact that you had even that much of that experience is something,

482
00:29:51,945 --> 00:29:55,725
Speaker 5:  It was for the glasses though, just because there is more interaction with

483
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:59,325
Speaker 5:  the world around you and some things that I would be like, oh, this would

484
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:03,445
Speaker 5:  actually be useful in my life. Like stepping out of a subway and going

485
00:30:03,445 --> 00:30:07,005
Speaker 5:  like, I have, I have no, no idea which way is north south. I have

486
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,245
Speaker 5:  directionally challenged, looked down, can see a map, know which way I need

487
00:30:10,245 --> 00:30:14,045
Speaker 5:  to go. Like those are things that feel real. Right? But

488
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:18,045
Speaker 5:  do I think Gemini is gonna be the key to unlocking that?

489
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:19,265
Speaker 5:  Mm,

490
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:24,665
Speaker 5:  I I wanna play with it. I wanna see how I can break it. Like

491
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:28,945
Speaker 5:  I had a demo where I had a woman speaking in Spanish in front of me and I

492
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:32,505
Speaker 5:  was getting immediate translations beamed into my eyeballs

493
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:36,785
Speaker 5:  in English. And she was enunciating, she was speaking clearly.

494
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,745
Speaker 5:  She was not using slang, she was not talking in the ways like, would you

495
00:30:40,745 --> 00:30:44,265
Speaker 5:  be able to translate a Gen Z saying like, Sigma Alpha Riz Ohio

496
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:48,625
Speaker 5:  to me, like, you know, like that sort of stuff is

497
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:52,425
Speaker 5:  the, is the st you know, like until it can do that, until it can

498
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:56,225
Speaker 5:  adopt to real life in real time. That's, that's the real

499
00:30:56,545 --> 00:30:59,945
Speaker 5:  question. If we were just living in the controlled demo, sure, sure. I believe

500
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:03,675
Speaker 5:  it. But we don't, life is weird. The the

501
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:06,795
Speaker 5:  this, you know, and it's, it's very halian when you go into these demos,

502
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:09,835
Speaker 5:  they're very pollyannaish about like how people will use these things. And

503
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:13,315
Speaker 5:  I'm very curious to see how we're going to break them and how

504
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:17,355
Speaker 5:  whether Gemini's up to the task Gemini was very sassy with me though,

505
00:31:17,505 --> 00:31:21,315
Speaker 5:  because I was thinking of how to phrase my, my

506
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:24,515
Speaker 5:  questions because we are so trained to be like, hey,

507
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:29,235
Speaker 5:  insert name of assistant play song from album in

508
00:31:29,335 --> 00:31:32,875
Speaker 5:  app and like these very stilted ways of talking. So natural

509
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:37,275
Speaker 5:  language is mind blowing. But it, it's, it's also just like I was, I was

510
00:31:37,275 --> 00:31:40,715
Speaker 5:  pausing and Gemini says to me, you don't have to say hey Google. Really?

511
00:31:40,955 --> 00:31:43,915
Speaker 5:  I was like, oh geez, whoa, geez, she's so sassy.

512
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:46,075
Speaker 1:  She's like, that's actually not my name. If you could just,

513
00:31:46,215 --> 00:31:49,675
Speaker 5:  If you could address me correctly, not my name. And then I said I was the,

514
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:53,515
Speaker 5:  the other really creepy thing is I said I was hungry inside of Project Moan

515
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:56,795
Speaker 5:  and I was looking at Google Maps and whatever, and it just started popping

516
00:31:56,855 --> 00:32:00,235
Speaker 5:  up restaurant recommendations Whoa. All around me in the thing. And I was

517
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:03,795
Speaker 5:  like, that's creepy. That's whoa. I don't know if I like that.

518
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,035
Speaker 5:  Thank you. Yeah. But I don't know if I like that.

519
00:32:06,305 --> 00:32:09,915
Speaker 1:  That is, that is the slow tilt toward the ad hellscape that

520
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:10,715
Speaker 1:  makes

521
00:32:10,715 --> 00:32:14,275
Speaker 5:  Me worry. It is, it is. It's, wow, I can't believe you have to have boundaries

522
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:15,115
Speaker 5:  with it. Like, hey,

523
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:16,395
Speaker 1:  I'm not interested

524
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:17,915
Speaker 5:  In that. I did not ask for that. Thank you.

525
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:20,755
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Here's what I will and won't talk about Gemini. Yeah. I have, oh my

526
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:24,155
Speaker 1:  gosh, I have, I have rules. Kylie, same question to you with Astro, which

527
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:27,915
Speaker 1:  I think like, like you were saying is like Google's most

528
00:32:28,075 --> 00:32:31,875
Speaker 1:  ambitious version of AI things you've now used the the

529
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:35,395
Speaker 1:  latest and greatest of astral. Like do you, do you see something big inside

530
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:36,075
Speaker 1:  of that yet?

531
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:38,835
Speaker 5:  I do. I agree with V though that, I

532
00:32:38,835 --> 00:32:42,725
Speaker 4:  Mean like, real life is very messy and variable and yeah,

533
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:46,405
Speaker 4:  15% of Google searches are new still this many years

534
00:32:46,575 --> 00:32:50,525
Speaker 4:  after the start. I think that that's the, that's real life.

535
00:32:51,545 --> 00:32:54,885
Speaker 4:  So I don't know if this comes out anytime soon. I, and

536
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:59,855
Speaker 4:  I think AI as a field is so,

537
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:04,175
Speaker 4:  it's in a really weird spot. It costs a lot of money, but Google has a

538
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:04,535
Speaker 4:  lot of money

539
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:10,815
Speaker 4:  and I think they're willing to really sink it into this. So yeah, I do, I

540
00:33:10,815 --> 00:33:13,855
Speaker 4:  do see these being really useful. Astra I'm not sure how I would use that

541
00:33:13,855 --> 00:33:17,815
Speaker 4:  outside of glasses if I'm being honest. That's where it seems most useful

542
00:33:17,815 --> 00:33:20,455
Speaker 4:  to me in a wearable form factor. 'cause I don't think I wanna walk around

543
00:33:20,455 --> 00:33:24,175
Speaker 4:  with my phone killing its battery, asking it questions. Yeah. But

544
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:27,615
Speaker 4:  it's cool. It's still cool. As for the Project

545
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:31,655
Speaker 4:  Mariner, I had said a while ago, 'cause I had gone to

546
00:33:31,655 --> 00:33:35,615
Speaker 4:  New York and I, you know, was bopping between places really quickly and

547
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:38,535
Speaker 4:  I was like, I would just love something I can say like, okay, I'm boarding

548
00:33:38,535 --> 00:33:41,855
Speaker 4:  this flight at this time. Can you get these groceries for me and make sure

549
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:45,295
Speaker 4:  they're at my door? You know, at this time. That would be great.

550
00:33:45,645 --> 00:33:48,855
Speaker 4:  It's, it's a very silly thing. But when I saw Project Mariner, I was like,

551
00:33:48,855 --> 00:33:52,655
Speaker 4:  oh, this is like almost what is trying to do except you

552
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,735
Speaker 4:  have to supervise it. You would be faster and you have like, you literally

553
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:59,215
Speaker 4:  just have to watch it do its work. But yeah, I think that that

554
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:03,375
Speaker 4:  could be useful if they can nail it down, make it faster, make

555
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:07,055
Speaker 4:  it safe in the long term. However, I am not a hundred percent sure

556
00:34:07,165 --> 00:34:10,175
Speaker 4:  they can iron those out. I don't know what they would need to do to iron

557
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:13,965
Speaker 4:  those things out. I think as all the AI leaders like to say, like

558
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:16,805
Speaker 4:  Altman likes to say, we're gonna need some major breakthroughs. And

559
00:38:59,105 --> 00:39:02,605
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Let's talk about video games and more specifically,

560
00:39:03,145 --> 00:39:06,965
Speaker 1:  the most important stories yet to come in the video game

561
00:39:07,165 --> 00:39:10,085
Speaker 1:  industry. There are two things looming over video games,

562
00:39:10,855 --> 00:39:13,875
Speaker 1:  grand Theft Auto six, Nintendo Switch two,

563
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:18,415
Speaker 1:  both things seem to be real. Both things will ship at some point

564
00:39:18,995 --> 00:39:22,935
Speaker 1:  and it's kind of all anybody has been able to talk about all year. Ash

565
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:26,135
Speaker 1:  Parish came on the show a few weeks ago and said that the biggest story of

566
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:29,975
Speaker 1:  the year in gaming was these two things that don't exist yet. Grand Theft

567
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:33,895
Speaker 1:  Auto Six just won most anticipated game at the

568
00:39:33,895 --> 00:39:37,135
Speaker 1:  Game Awards. It's literally winning awards before the game. Even chips like

569
00:39:37,135 --> 00:39:40,775
Speaker 1:  this is how much this stuff matters right now. And I think the

570
00:39:40,785 --> 00:39:44,455
Speaker 1:  story of those two things is going to be in a very real way,

571
00:39:44,755 --> 00:39:48,495
Speaker 1:  the story of the game industry, but also maybe bigger.

572
00:39:48,675 --> 00:39:52,655
Speaker 1:  It might be a story about the entertainment industry or the tech industry.

573
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:56,655
Speaker 1:  If these things are as big and successful as they might be, we are going

574
00:39:56,655 --> 00:40:00,255
Speaker 1:  to talk an awful lot about them. And So I figured before they launch, before

575
00:40:00,255 --> 00:40:03,775
Speaker 1:  things get too crazy, Chris Grant, who is the founding editor of Polygon

576
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:07,455
Speaker 1:  and is now the group publisher for The Verge and Polygon and I think that

577
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,215
Speaker 1:  makes him like my boss's boss's boss or something like that.

578
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:15,415
Speaker 1:  He's just a video game nerd. So I figured I'd have him on and we'd talk about

579
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,615
Speaker 1:  why these things matter so much and where they're headed. Chris Grant, welcome

580
00:40:19,615 --> 00:40:19,855
Speaker 1:  back.

581
00:40:20,455 --> 00:40:22,095
Speaker 6:  I don't know when last time I've been on the show is so

582
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:23,455
Speaker 1:  It's been a minute I'm gonna accept

583
00:40:23,645 --> 00:40:26,375
Speaker 6:  Welcome back, but it's been a couple decades.

584
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:28,855
Speaker 1:  Decades. It has been a couple of decades. Every once in a while I'm like,

585
00:40:28,855 --> 00:40:30,575
Speaker 1:  Chris, you should come on the show. And you're like, I'd love to come on

586
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:32,615
Speaker 1:  the show. And then I'm like, do you wanna come on the show? And you're like,

587
00:40:32,615 --> 00:40:35,655
Speaker 1:  I'm busy, this is, this happens frequently. Or

588
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,655
Speaker 6:  Chris, you should come on the show. I'm like, sick anytime David. And you're

589
00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:42,815
Speaker 6:  like, I'll put it in your calendar and then I wait and patiently. Mm.

590
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:46,215
Speaker 1:  That doesn't sound as right to me. But anyway, I have two things I wanna

591
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:49,495
Speaker 1:  talk about before the year is over. Ash Parrish came on the show a couple

592
00:40:49,495 --> 00:40:52,775
Speaker 1:  weeks ago and said that the biggest story

593
00:40:53,315 --> 00:40:56,735
Speaker 1:  in gaming of 2024 was two things that have not yet shipped.

594
00:40:57,795 --> 00:41:00,255
Speaker 1:  And I find that fascinating and I've been thinking about it ever since. And

595
00:41:00,255 --> 00:41:01,775
Speaker 1:  I want to talk about both of them with you.

596
00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:06,855
Speaker 1:  We're recording this on Friday, the day after the game awards where Grand

597
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:10,455
Speaker 1:  Theft Auto Six just won most anticipated game. So let's just start

598
00:41:10,585 --> 00:41:14,575
Speaker 1:  there. Let's just talk about GTA six because I feel like I am still struggling

599
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:18,415
Speaker 1:  to wrap my mind around how important and

600
00:41:18,415 --> 00:41:21,335
Speaker 1:  anticipated and big a deal this game is

601
00:41:22,755 --> 00:41:26,455
Speaker 1:  in the next year, but also in kind of like the next generation of

602
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:30,335
Speaker 1:  video gaming. So like, just to wind this all the way back to the beginning,

603
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:35,365
Speaker 1:  why is Grand Theft Auto such such an important franchise? Like why has this

604
00:41:35,365 --> 00:41:38,045
Speaker 1:  thing meant so much to the gaming industry for this long

605
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:42,595
Speaker 6:  Grand Theft Auto is an older franchise, so it's

606
00:41:42,595 --> 00:41:46,235
Speaker 6:  been around a minute. Most notably Grand Theft Auto three, which came out

607
00:41:46,235 --> 00:41:48,635
Speaker 6:  on the PlayStation two. PlayStation two is the bestselling game console of

608
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:52,035
Speaker 6:  all time. And as gaming became a more adult pursuit,

609
00:41:52,985 --> 00:41:56,975
Speaker 6:  there were fewer and fewer games to play as an adult, or maybe more

610
00:41:57,135 --> 00:42:00,535
Speaker 6:  specifically as a teenager, looking for things that weren't more childish.

611
00:42:00,535 --> 00:42:04,375
Speaker 6:  And Grant Theft Auto three came at a time when there was a real

612
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,735
Speaker 6:  appetite for that. There was a real appetite for games to feel more mature

613
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:12,295
Speaker 6:  and Grant Theft Auto wanted to were, for all intents and purposes, different

614
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:15,775
Speaker 6:  games. They were top down. It wasn't the same kind of open world sandbox

615
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:19,495
Speaker 6:  that we think of today. So three was the real change. It came at the right

616
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,175
Speaker 6:  moment technologically, it came at the right moment. Culturally, I think

617
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:25,975
Speaker 6:  a lot of video games like it's cultural. Yeah. Video games are

618
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:29,335
Speaker 6:  entertainment products. They aren't powered by hardware, they have generational

619
00:42:29,385 --> 00:42:32,895
Speaker 6:  leaps. We'll talk about some of that generational leap when we get into six.

620
00:42:33,115 --> 00:42:36,775
Speaker 6:  But they are fundamentally cultural moments and how you talk about them,

621
00:42:37,275 --> 00:42:41,255
Speaker 6:  how you play them, what you do, that's what powers the sort of

622
00:42:41,255 --> 00:42:44,655
Speaker 6:  culture and sort of legend of some of these games.

623
00:42:45,155 --> 00:42:48,295
Speaker 6:  Why are people excited about Grants Theft Auto Six? Because it's part of

624
00:42:48,295 --> 00:42:51,175
Speaker 6:  the Grand Thefts auto franchise. Yeah, they haven't played it before. It'll

625
00:42:51,175 --> 00:42:53,615
Speaker 6:  be different. And why are they excited about the Grand Theft Auto franchise?

626
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:56,135
Speaker 6:  Because they've played three, or they played four or they played five and

627
00:42:56,135 --> 00:42:58,135
Speaker 6:  they have memories of playing with their friends or they played it in their

628
00:42:58,135 --> 00:43:00,775
Speaker 6:  college dorm or they played it with their buddies after work. They played

629
00:43:00,775 --> 00:43:04,175
Speaker 6:  it online increasingly is how a lot of people engage with this game. And

630
00:43:05,645 --> 00:43:09,415
Speaker 6:  that volume of play across

631
00:43:09,525 --> 00:43:13,455
Speaker 6:  decades is so profound and the sales

632
00:43:13,455 --> 00:43:16,415
Speaker 6:  numbers are so high that the number of people who have touched this franchise

633
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:20,255
Speaker 6:  and may wanna touch it again becomes kind of staggering under its own weight.

634
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:24,695
Speaker 6:  And so when you talk about 2025, you're really looking at an audience

635
00:43:24,765 --> 00:43:28,735
Speaker 6:  that, not just the audience for GTA five or GTA online, but some

636
00:43:28,735 --> 00:43:31,535
Speaker 6:  of that audience for four and some of that audience for three or some of

637
00:43:31,535 --> 00:43:35,495
Speaker 6:  that audience for Vice City or San Andreas or whatever. And how many of

638
00:43:35,495 --> 00:43:39,415
Speaker 6:  those people will trade up for the new one. That's a lot

639
00:43:39,415 --> 00:43:39,695
Speaker 6:  of folks.

640
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:44,255
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Well, but what I wonder about the way you describe the

641
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,725
Speaker 1:  legacy is like you, you could say a lot of that same stuff about, I don't

642
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:51,645
Speaker 1:  know, the, the Halo franchise over the years or Call of Duty or

643
00:43:51,645 --> 00:43:55,085
Speaker 1:  like Madden If you stretch a little bit, right? Like the, the stuff that

644
00:43:55,085 --> 00:43:59,005
Speaker 1:  sort of culturally means things to people unlike your average video game.

645
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:02,925
Speaker 1:  But I don't feel like we're, we talk about Grand Theft

646
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:05,685
Speaker 1:  Auto the same way that we talk about those games. Like no, nobody is like

647
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:09,325
Speaker 1:  hanging the future of the gaming and entertainment industries on the success

648
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:13,125
Speaker 1:  of the Next Call of Duty. Mm. There's something different about GTA.

649
00:44:13,405 --> 00:44:15,925
Speaker 6:  I might argue the thesis on Call of Duty a little bit. Okay. Considering

650
00:44:15,985 --> 00:44:19,965
Speaker 6:  the Microsoft Activision Blizzard merger, largely powered by

651
00:44:20,355 --> 00:44:21,765
Speaker 6:  Call of Duty Fair.

652
00:44:22,005 --> 00:44:24,445
Speaker 1:  Alright. Maybe the next one more than most. Yeah.

653
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,885
Speaker 6:  Call of Duty is a little different 'cause it comes out every year. Fair.

654
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:31,925
Speaker 6:  So you know, if if the last GTA came out in 2013,

655
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:35,925
Speaker 6:  which is wild, is that true? Yes. We'll talk about sort of like

656
00:44:35,995 --> 00:44:39,525
Speaker 6:  what that means to have a franchise that's taking that kind of gap year

657
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:43,285
Speaker 6:  between its career and what's happened

658
00:44:43,695 --> 00:44:47,365
Speaker 6:  since 2013 to now. The whole world's different

659
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:50,685
Speaker 6:  frankly. And and not to mention video gaming and technology that makes video

660
00:44:50,685 --> 00:44:54,405
Speaker 6:  games possible, which is also sort of a wild testament to GTA Five's success.

661
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:57,525
Speaker 6:  That it remains one of the top 10 most played games and bestselling games

662
00:44:57,655 --> 00:45:00,005
Speaker 6:  every year in that interim period. I

663
00:45:00,005 --> 00:45:02,485
Speaker 1:  And I, I confess, I haven't played GTA five in a long time, but from the

664
00:45:02,485 --> 00:45:05,725
Speaker 1:  little bit I understand it's a very different game now than it was in 2013.

665
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:05,965
Speaker 1:  Right?

666
00:45:06,545 --> 00:45:09,805
Speaker 6:  The game is the same as in the single player game. Sure. Okay.

667
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:13,375
Speaker 6:  There's a bunch of DLC that they had committed to release that never came

668
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:17,135
Speaker 6:  out. Right? Like what is different is GTA online. And GTA

669
00:45:17,135 --> 00:45:20,415
Speaker 6:  Online did not launch alongside GTA five. It came out a little later.

670
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:24,335
Speaker 6:  GTA Online is the thing that has propelled that game and propelled its sort

671
00:45:24,335 --> 00:45:28,175
Speaker 6:  of popularity over the years, which we can get into. But

672
00:45:28,235 --> 00:45:31,935
Speaker 6:  the, you know, games like Madden games like Call of Duty, they're

673
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:34,415
Speaker 6:  immensely popular. They sell a ton. They're some of the bestselling games

674
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:37,095
Speaker 6:  every year. Those are the games that people will trade up every year. They

675
00:45:37,095 --> 00:45:41,015
Speaker 6:  have this memories of playing it and they accrue some new audience and

676
00:45:41,015 --> 00:45:43,895
Speaker 6:  they shed some audience. And it's so it's like not different from a subscription

677
00:45:44,095 --> 00:45:47,335
Speaker 6:  business, right? Is your churn gonna turn over the audience on the higher

678
00:45:47,335 --> 00:45:49,535
Speaker 6:  end? They don't wanna play anymore. Do you pick up new audience at the younger

679
00:45:49,555 --> 00:45:49,775
Speaker 6:  end?

680
00:45:49,885 --> 00:45:52,495
Speaker 1:  It's an interesting way to think about it. You just pay 60 bucks a year for

681
00:45:52,495 --> 00:45:53,655
Speaker 1:  Madden. That's just how it's, that's it.

682
00:45:53,655 --> 00:45:57,135
Speaker 6:  That's your subscription cost. Yeah. Yeah. And so Halo a little different.

683
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:00,855
Speaker 6:  I think Microsoft wishes it had a Call of Duty or Madden and Halo is not

684
00:46:00,855 --> 00:46:04,215
Speaker 6:  managed to retain that cultural relevance.

685
00:46:05,235 --> 00:46:09,055
Speaker 6:  But GTA has, and it has in part because you know, previous

686
00:46:09,515 --> 00:46:13,495
Speaker 6:  GTA four to five I think was 2009 to 13. So there's a four year gap there.

687
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:17,095
Speaker 6:  Reasonable, right? Same generation. That was the Xbox 360

688
00:46:17,315 --> 00:46:20,735
Speaker 6:  PS three generation GTA five comes on the tail end of that generation

689
00:46:21,275 --> 00:46:24,695
Speaker 6:  as in like the very tail end, like the new consoles are coming out. Hmm.

690
00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:28,335
Speaker 6:  And it sets records, right? It's the fastest selling entertainment product

691
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:30,855
Speaker 6:  of all time, et cetera, et cetera, right? It continues to hold some of these

692
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:33,455
Speaker 6:  records as being one of the highest grossing entertainment products ever

693
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:36,495
Speaker 6:  made as an individual product. Wow. But that's on the

694
00:46:37,165 --> 00:46:41,055
Speaker 6:  Xbox 360 hardware, that's on the PlayStation three hardware.

695
00:46:41,775 --> 00:46:42,975
Speaker 6:  And just like put that in context

696
00:46:44,725 --> 00:46:48,655
Speaker 6:  that those consoles, at least the 360 came out in 2005. PS three came

697
00:46:48,655 --> 00:46:52,295
Speaker 6:  out the following year. That's 20 years ago. Yeah, 20

698
00:46:52,305 --> 00:46:56,205
Speaker 6:  years before the 360 came out was the NES.

699
00:46:56,825 --> 00:46:57,045
Speaker 1:  Wow.

700
00:46:58,035 --> 00:47:01,805
Speaker 6:  Like, yeah. I don't wanna make every half the listeners just turn to

701
00:47:02,045 --> 00:47:02,685
Speaker 6:  Ash. I'm sorry,

702
00:47:03,315 --> 00:47:05,085
Speaker 1:  Dust. That was off. I didn't like that at all.

703
00:47:05,595 --> 00:47:08,885
Speaker 6:  Shoulda trigger warning. Liam, let's add a trigger warning before I say that

704
00:47:09,915 --> 00:47:13,845
Speaker 6:  just in case anyone's driving or something. So 20 years is a long time

705
00:47:13,845 --> 00:47:17,365
Speaker 6:  technologically, and we're talking about, you know, a game that was

706
00:47:17,395 --> 00:47:21,365
Speaker 6:  targeting hardware that came out in 2005 and now we're talking about a game

707
00:47:21,365 --> 00:47:25,005
Speaker 6:  that's targeting hardware that came out in 2020. We're already on,

708
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:29,005
Speaker 6:  well you could say we're on the tail end, you know, on the back half of

709
00:47:29,435 --> 00:47:32,845
Speaker 6:  this generation of hardware, the PS five and series X. So

710
00:47:33,515 --> 00:47:37,285
Speaker 6:  this is a wild generational leap for a game that itself has

711
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:41,325
Speaker 6:  come to define technological leaps. What is possible with the

712
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:45,165
Speaker 6:  state-of-the-art and games technology, what is that gonna mean? I'm sure

713
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:49,045
Speaker 6:  you've seen some of the GTA five videos where they put crazy realtime mods

714
00:47:49,045 --> 00:47:52,605
Speaker 6:  in there. Like it looks like real life stuff. Like it's kind of nuts.

715
00:47:53,275 --> 00:47:56,885
Speaker 6:  What happens to a gate? My GTA six when this amount of budget, this amount

716
00:47:56,885 --> 00:48:00,605
Speaker 6:  of time. And then to your point, the expectations that come on the other

717
00:48:00,605 --> 00:48:04,565
Speaker 6:  side of it, will it meet them to some degree? I mean it has

718
00:48:04,565 --> 00:48:08,405
Speaker 6:  to, it's, it's a, it's a make or break kind of moment,

719
00:48:09,525 --> 00:48:12,505
Speaker 6:  but a franchise. And then on the other hand, of course it'll, right, like

720
00:48:12,505 --> 00:48:16,105
Speaker 6:  the level of expectation on a game like this is so high. The number of people

721
00:48:16,105 --> 00:48:19,845
Speaker 6:  that will buy it just to mess around with it. I will buy it.

722
00:48:19,905 --> 00:48:22,525
Speaker 6:  I'm not a huge GTA, but I will say, I'll confess on the internet, please

723
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:26,185
Speaker 6:  don't harass me on the internet. I've never beat a GTA game.

724
00:48:26,575 --> 00:48:29,905
Speaker 6:  I've played hundreds of hours of GTA games and I play the missions and they're

725
00:48:30,055 --> 00:48:34,025
Speaker 6:  just, I'm not for me and I can't get through them, but I

726
00:48:34,025 --> 00:48:36,665
Speaker 6:  will play it to mess around. And so you get to GTA online and the point of

727
00:48:36,765 --> 00:48:40,745
Speaker 6:  GTA online is just go mess around. Right? Okay. And I think that what a game

728
00:48:40,745 --> 00:48:43,585
Speaker 6:  looks like today and and how you develop a game and what kind of audience

729
00:48:43,785 --> 00:48:47,265
Speaker 6:  you target, that's really hard If you haven't been providing that live service

730
00:48:47,295 --> 00:48:50,545
Speaker 6:  that Rockstar has been providing this whole time. And So I assume that they're

731
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:53,945
Speaker 6:  going to GTA six with some real focus on the single player, a huge focus

732
00:48:53,945 --> 00:48:57,505
Speaker 6:  on the technology and what that sandbox enables them to do. But then just

733
00:48:57,505 --> 00:49:01,425
Speaker 6:  as much focus on the living game aspect of

734
00:49:01,425 --> 00:49:05,145
Speaker 6:  it. Games as a service. What does it mean to have a game like GTA six

735
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:09,185
Speaker 6:  and its online component exists for another 13 years

736
00:49:09,435 --> 00:49:13,385
Speaker 6:  afterwards. That's gonna put us into 2038 for everyone else that

737
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:16,825
Speaker 6:  wants to think about when their retirement target looks like. Yeah,

738
00:49:16,985 --> 00:49:19,945
Speaker 1:  I mean that's part of what's interesting about this moment to me, because

739
00:49:19,965 --> 00:49:23,945
Speaker 1:  if, if GTA online didn't exist, I think everybody

740
00:49:23,945 --> 00:49:27,185
Speaker 1:  would be making sort of the same assumption about what GTA six was going

741
00:49:27,185 --> 00:49:30,905
Speaker 1:  to be. Right? They were going to expand the idea of an open world game,

742
00:49:30,905 --> 00:49:34,345
Speaker 1:  give you more to do more things going on, make the world feel bigger, just

743
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:37,785
Speaker 1:  like do it at a scale nobody has done before. Right? That's kind of GTA's

744
00:49:37,785 --> 00:49:41,625
Speaker 1:  thing, but that's kind of already what it's doing. That's like what

745
00:49:41,885 --> 00:49:45,705
Speaker 1:  GTA online is and is becoming to a certain extent. So part of me

746
00:49:45,705 --> 00:49:49,505
Speaker 1:  wonders what if there is even an obvious

747
00:49:49,505 --> 00:49:53,145
Speaker 1:  thing for this game to do that feels like a, a generational leap that way.

748
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:57,505
Speaker 6:  I think that there's a couple things I could imagine them doing and

749
00:49:57,565 --> 00:50:00,945
Speaker 6:  you know, GTA online is really big and ambitious, but it's not what people

750
00:50:00,945 --> 00:50:04,865
Speaker 6:  think of as state-of-the-art when it comes to online social

751
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:08,785
Speaker 6:  based play. Right? Exactly. I mean, Fortnite is right there

752
00:50:09,415 --> 00:50:13,065
Speaker 6:  sort of commanding a level of attention and a level of diversity across its

753
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:16,665
Speaker 6:  different products. Just this week they launched new

754
00:50:16,935 --> 00:50:20,625
Speaker 6:  ballistic mode, five V five multiplayer, like they're gonna go head to head

755
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:23,985
Speaker 6:  with Call of Duty now in Fortnite. They've got a new Lego brick life mode.

756
00:50:24,005 --> 00:50:26,425
Speaker 6:  So it's, you can just hang out and build Lego stuff and have a little town

757
00:50:26,425 --> 00:50:30,245
Speaker 6:  and play different careers. They're gonna have, the OG mode is back.

758
00:50:30,455 --> 00:50:33,525
Speaker 6:  Right. Hugely popular. And like Fortnite as a platform

759
00:50:34,285 --> 00:50:38,265
Speaker 6:  is a really interesting idea and how it competes in a world of increasing

760
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:42,545
Speaker 6:  consolidation on that end of the market. Is GTA six a platform? I

761
00:50:42,545 --> 00:50:45,225
Speaker 6:  don't know. I would not be surprised If

762
00:50:45,225 --> 00:50:48,865
Speaker 1:  You, If you roll back to the way you described the game 20 years ago, like

763
00:50:49,325 --> 00:50:52,265
Speaker 1:  the, the phrase that just popped into my mind is Roblox for adults,

764
00:50:53,275 --> 00:50:57,265
Speaker 1:  which is like a thoroughly fascinating possibility that really doesn't exist

765
00:50:57,645 --> 00:50:58,985
Speaker 1:  in kind of the way you're describing.

766
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:02,345
Speaker 6:  Roblox wants to tell you it exists, but it does not. It does not exist. Yeah.

767
00:51:02,665 --> 00:51:05,945
Speaker 6:  I think And Epic is trying to make that into Fortnite. Yeah. And I see the

768
00:51:05,945 --> 00:51:09,305
Speaker 6:  Fortnite Islands and it's all the same Roblox junk,

769
00:51:09,495 --> 00:51:13,145
Speaker 6:  billionaire simulator and like all this like Yeah. Clicker game

770
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:17,065
Speaker 6:  stuff. The vernacular of those games is pretty

771
00:51:17,065 --> 00:51:20,985
Speaker 6:  limited. And when I see my son play Roblox

772
00:51:20,985 --> 00:51:24,745
Speaker 6:  games, I know I'm a bad parent. They're trash. Yeah. The

773
00:51:25,005 --> 00:51:28,905
Speaker 6:  low nutritional value, right. Trust that I make Astro

774
00:51:28,905 --> 00:51:32,705
Speaker 6:  Bott available at all times for my family. It's available day or night. So

775
00:51:32,705 --> 00:51:33,945
Speaker 1:  You're a good parent. That's, that's the

776
00:51:33,945 --> 00:51:37,785
Speaker 6:  Job. I'm a good parent. Astro Bott notably gave me the year winner

777
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:41,665
Speaker 6:  yesterday last night. That's right. I don't wanna say

778
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:45,185
Speaker 6:  Polygon got it wrong. It was Bicho at Polygon, but in this

779
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,965
Speaker 6:  household we stand astronaut so

780
00:51:49,385 --> 00:51:52,285
Speaker 6:  GTA six. Yeah, I, I have some real questions about what it means to support

781
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:55,885
Speaker 6:  that game over the decade plus that they intend to support it. Is it going

782
00:51:55,885 --> 00:51:59,165
Speaker 6:  to be a platform? Are they gonna think of it that way? How do experiences

783
00:51:59,305 --> 00:52:02,725
Speaker 6:  get built into, how do you keep an audience engaged when the competition

784
00:52:02,725 --> 00:52:06,085
Speaker 6:  is more fierce? They're not going up against the competition in 2013. They're

785
00:52:06,085 --> 00:52:09,965
Speaker 6:  going up against competition in 2025. You see Call of Duty. I think

786
00:52:09,965 --> 00:52:13,205
Speaker 6:  doing an admirable job here with Warzone and thinking of what that free to

787
00:52:13,205 --> 00:52:16,965
Speaker 6:  play environment looks like for a Call of Duty game and how that is complimentary

788
00:52:16,965 --> 00:52:20,845
Speaker 6:  to a retail product and how they sort of push it forward. But

789
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:24,645
Speaker 6:  yeah, it's, it's gonna be fascinating. I think they have a

790
00:52:24,645 --> 00:52:28,405
Speaker 6:  track record that really can't be denied. And I think even

791
00:52:28,405 --> 00:52:32,325
Speaker 6:  just to Ash's point, one of the biggest stories this year is just like

792
00:52:32,595 --> 00:52:36,525
Speaker 6:  waiting for any sign of anything having to

793
00:52:36,525 --> 00:52:40,365
Speaker 6:  do with six, a news announcement, a trailer, you name it. Those things

794
00:52:41,385 --> 00:52:45,365
Speaker 6:  really indicate a level of sort of like latent energy,

795
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:48,845
Speaker 6:  right? It's just gonna explode when it comes out and you'll capture all of

796
00:52:48,845 --> 00:52:51,645
Speaker 6:  that. Well, you capture more and I think they do need to capture more for

797
00:52:51,645 --> 00:52:55,445
Speaker 6:  a product this size to be successful. We will see. I do, I

798
00:52:55,725 --> 00:52:59,645
Speaker 6:  think the, the sense though that the non-lease of some of these

799
00:52:59,645 --> 00:53:03,445
Speaker 6:  things has been looming over 24 last year we

800
00:53:03,465 --> 00:53:07,285
Speaker 6:  had tears of the Kingdom, which I think, you know, demanded a lot of

801
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:11,085
Speaker 6:  attention and, and sort of gathered up a lot of that energy. But in the

802
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:14,205
Speaker 6:  background, amidst gaming today, the top 10

803
00:53:14,835 --> 00:53:18,525
Speaker 6:  most played games on PC in 2023, Fortnite, number one,

804
00:53:18,745 --> 00:53:22,645
Speaker 6:  Roblox Minecraft, Counterstrike two counter co sort of shared

805
00:53:23,155 --> 00:53:26,965
Speaker 6:  Sims four Call of Duty, you know, TKTK, mono

806
00:53:26,965 --> 00:53:30,925
Speaker 6:  Warfare two three War Zone two League of Legends, Valant, GTA five, and Rocket

807
00:53:30,925 --> 00:53:34,885
Speaker 6:  League. That's the top played games. Here's

808
00:53:34,885 --> 00:53:38,445
Speaker 6:  the wild statistic about that. Average years on the market for those games.

809
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:40,505
Speaker 6:  9.6 years.

810
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:41,345
Speaker 1:  Wow.

811
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,385
Speaker 6:  So the games people are playing are not new games that just come out.

812
00:53:45,845 --> 00:53:49,585
Speaker 6:  And so what's happened in gaming is that these things have to last much

813
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:52,985
Speaker 6:  longer. They have to function like platforms. They have to function. Like

814
00:53:53,345 --> 00:53:56,745
Speaker 6:  I actually look at this list of games even across the other consoles, maybe

815
00:53:56,745 --> 00:53:59,905
Speaker 6:  with the exception of Switch. And it doesn't look like games the way I think

816
00:53:59,985 --> 00:54:03,305
Speaker 6:  a lot of times we think about it, it looks like sports, right? And I don't

817
00:54:03,305 --> 00:54:06,665
Speaker 6:  mean eSports here. I mean like, it looks like the way you think of sports.

818
00:54:06,945 --> 00:54:10,585
Speaker 6:  I like Minecraft. I, I like soccer. Like it's just

819
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:14,705
Speaker 6:  an abstraction. It always is there. It has rules. You

820
00:54:14,705 --> 00:54:18,585
Speaker 6:  play it with friends, it's Minecraft. Will GTA six earn a spot on

821
00:54:18,585 --> 00:54:21,865
Speaker 6:  this table? Like I kind of assume some of that of five volumes moves to it,

822
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:22,985
Speaker 6:  but what does it look like?

823
00:54:23,285 --> 00:54:27,225
Speaker 1:  But do you think it does that by owning that mold and

824
00:54:27,225 --> 00:54:29,945
Speaker 1:  sort of leaning into the, the kind of things that you're describing, you

825
00:54:29,945 --> 00:54:33,905
Speaker 1:  know, Roblox for adults? Or does it do it by going, doing

826
00:54:33,905 --> 00:54:37,585
Speaker 1:  the thing no one else can do and making a, a new sort of

827
00:54:37,845 --> 00:54:41,505
Speaker 1:  wholly contained game that is good enough to pull this off? 'cause I feel

828
00:54:41,505 --> 00:54:44,985
Speaker 1:  like you can, you can put your hopes on either one of those, but maybe not

829
00:54:44,985 --> 00:54:45,745
Speaker 1:  both at the same time.

830
00:54:46,245 --> 00:54:48,785
Speaker 6:  No, I'm gonna say both. I'm gonna say both. I'm gonna say that they're gonna

831
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,665
Speaker 6:  make a single player game that's gonna move the needle and sell a lot of

832
00:54:50,665 --> 00:54:52,785
Speaker 6:  units. 'cause people wanna play it and then they're gonna make a sticky,

833
00:54:52,935 --> 00:54:56,785
Speaker 6:  multiplayer online experience that is going to be competitive

834
00:54:57,165 --> 00:54:59,385
Speaker 6:  across a landscape that looks like this. That

835
00:54:59,385 --> 00:55:00,585
Speaker 1:  Would be a hell of an achievement

836
00:55:00,825 --> 00:55:04,705
Speaker 6:  That is going to grow and shift over time because they will continue to

837
00:55:04,825 --> 00:55:08,345
Speaker 6:  iterate on and develop it. Heists for GTA five came out years later.

838
00:55:08,535 --> 00:55:12,025
Speaker 6:  Sure. Right. And that was 10 years ago. Yeah. And they were still

839
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,785
Speaker 6:  aware that that game had to shift and move. They had to continuously add

840
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:20,025
Speaker 6:  features and add functionality for it to be successful. And now again,

841
00:55:21,035 --> 00:55:24,045
Speaker 6:  they're in a world where they compete against Fortnite and like they just,

842
00:55:24,065 --> 00:55:27,605
Speaker 6:  it has to be different now. Right now there's an ongoing event in Minecraft

843
00:55:28,065 --> 00:55:31,645
Speaker 6:  my son is very excited about. Like there's just a constant pace of iteration

844
00:55:31,645 --> 00:55:35,045
Speaker 6:  innovation happening in these spaces that GTA will have to

845
00:55:35,595 --> 00:55:38,685
Speaker 6:  compete with in a way that it, it kind of currently does. It is not

846
00:55:38,685 --> 00:55:42,605
Speaker 6:  non-competitive. I think a lot about what happens, the pace

847
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:45,325
Speaker 6:  of development games. I think a lot about the, the new final fantasy games

848
00:55:45,325 --> 00:55:48,925
Speaker 6:  that have come out and how they've really been struggling to, I think meet

849
00:55:48,925 --> 00:55:52,605
Speaker 6:  some sales expectations. One of the things that was crazy is the, the last

850
00:55:52,605 --> 00:55:56,245
Speaker 6:  Final Fantasy game 16, which

851
00:55:56,245 --> 00:55:59,605
Speaker 6:  struggled on a PlayStation exclusive, a weird concept

852
00:56:00,055 --> 00:56:03,525
Speaker 6:  these days and came to PC much later

853
00:56:04,265 --> 00:56:07,845
Speaker 6:  and struggled there. They'll make it up over time, I suspect. But it started

854
00:56:07,845 --> 00:56:11,605
Speaker 6:  development before Fortnite came out. Hmm. And I think that is like kind

855
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:15,485
Speaker 6:  of a wild sense, right? Of like how much changes in a certain period of time

856
00:56:15,515 --> 00:56:18,805
Speaker 6:  when a game like Fortnite can come out and quite liberate change what, what

857
00:56:18,805 --> 00:56:22,125
Speaker 6:  our expectations are of games and games culture, what you get for a free

858
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:25,885
Speaker 6:  to play game, how much value there is in a freemium model. Something that

859
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:28,965
Speaker 6:  a lot of gamers would turn their nose down at. Yeah. But then you look at

860
00:56:28,965 --> 00:56:32,485
Speaker 6:  Fortnite and like, this is a very high quality game that's a lot of fun to

861
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:35,645
Speaker 6:  play and is very good and you don't need to pay for anything. So

862
00:56:36,345 --> 00:56:39,525
Speaker 6:  if that was 2018, Fortnite really popped off

863
00:56:40,975 --> 00:56:44,805
Speaker 6:  again GTA five, 2013. Like how much has changed Yeah. Since they even started

864
00:56:44,805 --> 00:56:48,645
Speaker 6:  development on this game. And I think that's part of the expectation, that's

865
00:56:48,645 --> 00:56:52,445
Speaker 6:  part of the anticipation, it's part of that legacy. And I think

866
00:56:52,445 --> 00:56:55,805
Speaker 6:  there's, you know, there's also the technology of it. What more can they

867
00:56:55,805 --> 00:56:59,605
Speaker 6:  do with another effectively 15 years of

868
00:56:59,925 --> 00:57:02,685
Speaker 6:  hardware iteration, hardware development. It'll be exciting to see.

869
00:57:02,955 --> 00:57:06,725
Speaker 1:  Yeah. You've, you've tracked the hype cycle of games like this many times

870
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:07,565
Speaker 1:  over the years

871
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:13,285
Speaker 1:  are like, should people keep their hopes high on this one?

872
00:57:13,285 --> 00:57:16,205
Speaker 1:  Do you feel like, like is it, it does seem like if historically speaking,

873
00:57:16,205 --> 00:57:19,245
Speaker 1:  if anything is going to live up to this kind of hype,

874
00:57:21,145 --> 00:57:24,885
Speaker 1:  GTA has as good a shot as any. But also kind of like you said before, like

875
00:57:24,885 --> 00:57:27,845
Speaker 1:  maybe nothing can be as good as we're sort of expecting this game to be.

876
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:33,145
Speaker 6:  My general point of view is you shouldn't get hyped about anything.

877
00:57:34,525 --> 00:57:35,025
Speaker 6:  Try not to

878
00:57:35,095 --> 00:57:37,865
Speaker 1:  Just to touch a nihilism right before the holidays.

879
00:57:38,365 --> 00:57:42,185
Speaker 6:  Try not to. But If you insist on getting hyped about

880
00:57:42,405 --> 00:57:46,345
Speaker 6:  GTA six, If you like those games, will this game meet

881
00:57:46,345 --> 00:57:50,305
Speaker 6:  your expectations? I think so. Right. I I think that they've

882
00:57:50,305 --> 00:57:54,105
Speaker 6:  had a kind of impressively consistent hit

883
00:57:54,105 --> 00:57:56,745
Speaker 6:  rate Yeah. For that entire series.

884
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:02,465
Speaker 6:  Again, it's not my kinda game, but If you like those games, like they

885
00:58:02,465 --> 00:58:06,375
Speaker 6:  have, I don't wanna say never missed, but they've come closer than

886
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:09,935
Speaker 6:  most franchises to upholding a certain level of expectation and value.

887
00:58:10,295 --> 00:58:13,295
Speaker 6:  I think the way that they're releasing it and why to Ash's point it's been

888
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:17,335
Speaker 6:  looming over 24 is 'cause Take two has a very specific

889
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:21,015
Speaker 6:  point of view on the release strategy for this game, which is when it is

890
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:24,975
Speaker 6:  ready, there is no competition. It is an alpha predator.

891
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:29,625
Speaker 6:  There is no competition for GTA in the market. Yeah. They don't need

892
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:33,105
Speaker 6:  to release it. Nobody's nipping at their heels. There's still

893
00:58:33,265 --> 00:58:37,145
Speaker 6:  banking cash on five, which is still in the top

894
00:58:37,145 --> 00:58:40,905
Speaker 6:  10 most played games every year. So why rush it? They don't need to rush

895
00:58:40,905 --> 00:58:44,585
Speaker 6:  it and they will wait until it is ready and done.

896
00:58:44,765 --> 00:58:48,225
Speaker 6:  And I think that that is should be comforting to somebody who's looking forward

897
00:58:48,225 --> 00:58:51,625
Speaker 6:  to it. And then the question becomes, do they know what done means? Hmm.

898
00:58:52,005 --> 00:58:55,625
Speaker 6:  Is the target quality good? Is it what you want? Is it fun?

899
00:58:56,075 --> 00:58:59,145
Speaker 6:  Again, I think they have enough of a blueprint at this point to follow that

900
00:58:59,145 --> 00:59:03,105
Speaker 6:  people who like GTA games should probably be well

901
00:59:03,745 --> 00:59:07,585
Speaker 6:  targeted by it and they'll appreciate it. Now again, that

902
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:10,825
Speaker 6:  isn't enough. They will need to grow new audience, they will need to bring

903
00:59:10,825 --> 00:59:13,625
Speaker 6:  in new players, they will need to siphon off some of those Fortnite fans,

904
00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:17,265
Speaker 6:  et cetera. Will it do that? Does it have enough

905
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:20,865
Speaker 6:  juice to continue to grow over time

906
00:59:21,765 --> 00:59:25,165
Speaker 6:  instead of just keep what they have? And that's the big question for me and

907
00:59:25,245 --> 00:59:26,045
Speaker 6:  I, I dunno.

908
00:59:26,515 --> 00:59:30,245
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. I think to some extent the the like we're just gonna make a slightly

909
00:59:30,245 --> 00:59:33,045
Speaker 1:  better new game every year is like an actually easier

910
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:35,005
Speaker 1:  strategy. Yeah.

911
00:59:35,345 --> 00:59:39,205
Speaker 6:  The iterative year by year strategy is like expensive and

912
00:59:39,205 --> 00:59:42,405
Speaker 6:  difficult in its own way, but you know, you can have misses in there and

913
00:59:42,405 --> 00:59:45,645
Speaker 6:  keep going. Call of Duty modern warfare with a notable miss a few years ago

914
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:49,285
Speaker 6:  and like a little bit of a return to form this year. Okay. It can

915
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:53,125
Speaker 6:  absorb that impact again for GTA six. If this were to be a miss,

916
00:59:53,485 --> 00:59:56,085
Speaker 6:  I find it almost impossible to imagine it being a miss, but if it were to

917
00:59:56,085 --> 00:59:59,845
Speaker 6:  be a miss catastrophic, right. Like you don't get another

918
01:00:00,105 --> 01:00:03,965
Speaker 6:  at bat. So Yeah. It's a, it's a bit of a riskier

919
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:06,685
Speaker 6:  game. And again, to take two's point, like they'll just wait until it's ready.

920
01:00:06,795 --> 01:00:09,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There's no, there's no sense in taking that kind of risk.

921
01:00:09,995 --> 01:00:13,965
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So the, the other highly anticipated thing that I think we're

922
01:00:13,965 --> 01:00:17,805
Speaker 1:  likely to get way before GTA six is the

923
01:00:17,805 --> 01:00:21,645
Speaker 1:  switch to, I asked you when I saw you in person a couple of weeks ago to

924
01:00:21,645 --> 01:00:24,965
Speaker 1:  make me feel better that, that the switch to isn't gonna suck because I have

925
01:00:24,965 --> 01:00:28,725
Speaker 1:  pinned a surprising amount of my hopes and gaming future on the switch

926
01:00:28,745 --> 01:00:32,445
Speaker 1:  to not sucking. Tell me how to feel about the switch to

927
01:00:32,675 --> 01:00:35,925
Speaker 1:  it's, we, we assume it's coming sometime in the next three months, right?

928
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:39,525
Speaker 1:  Like it is, it is legitimately imminent in some way here.

929
01:00:40,395 --> 01:00:43,935
Speaker 6:  If I were to bet, I'm gonna say it's coming in the first half of the year.

930
01:00:44,205 --> 01:00:48,095
Speaker 6:  Okay. Nintendo's fiscal, I wanna say starts in Q2 in April.

931
01:00:48,715 --> 01:00:51,335
Speaker 6:  So there's a reason to think maybe they try and get it out just before, just

932
01:00:51,335 --> 01:00:55,175
Speaker 6:  after. We'll see. Sure. Nintendo will also wait until it's ready.

933
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:59,025
Speaker 6:  So there's that, the reporting so far has been that they

934
01:00:59,715 --> 01:01:03,525
Speaker 6:  wanna wait until they have enough units that there

935
01:01:03,525 --> 01:01:06,845
Speaker 6:  isn't any risk of hardware shortages or any other sort of holdups. So they

936
01:01:06,845 --> 01:01:08,685
Speaker 6:  just wanna be a short when it comes out you can get one

937
01:01:08,685 --> 01:01:11,005
Speaker 1:  Because there was a bunch of that at the beginning with the first switch.

938
01:01:11,005 --> 01:01:12,605
Speaker 1:  Right? Wasn't it hard to get for a while?

939
01:01:12,845 --> 01:01:15,165
Speaker 6:  Nintendo historically has struggled with

940
01:01:16,235 --> 01:01:20,085
Speaker 6:  inventory pipeline. Right? Remember the we Oh yeah. You couldn't buy it

941
01:01:20,085 --> 01:01:23,765
Speaker 6:  for years. Yeah. And it was already using old hardware

942
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:27,445
Speaker 6:  Nintendo's strategy of using older hardware. The Game Boy

943
01:01:27,665 --> 01:01:31,485
Speaker 6:  was famously built using really old hardware and they reimagined what that

944
01:01:31,485 --> 01:01:35,085
Speaker 6:  old hardware can do and that's sort of Nintendo's magic, but it's old

945
01:01:35,325 --> 01:01:38,405
Speaker 6:  hardware. Yeah. So the, we comes out with old hardware and they can't keep

946
01:01:38,405 --> 01:01:41,885
Speaker 6:  this thing in stock. That's, so there's something I always found

947
01:01:41,885 --> 01:01:44,725
Speaker 6:  Nintendo's point of view and that's a little disingenuous. I think that they

948
01:01:45,075 --> 01:01:48,645
Speaker 6:  like having things sell out. I think they like managing a very tight

949
01:01:49,025 --> 01:01:52,365
Speaker 6:  retail environment. That feeling of you got one

950
01:01:53,895 --> 01:01:57,845
Speaker 6:  fresh, I don't know if that works anymore. The space is

951
01:01:57,845 --> 01:02:01,245
Speaker 6:  too competitive. If you don't get that and there's a PlayStation five right

952
01:02:01,245 --> 01:02:03,925
Speaker 6:  next to it on the shelf, maybe you just pick that up instead. Yeah. That

953
01:02:03,925 --> 01:02:07,765
Speaker 6:  is Fortnite on it too. Like Right. What's the point? And So I, I

954
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:10,125
Speaker 6:  do think that they recognize they're in a different environment and that

955
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:13,245
Speaker 6:  they will need to keep stock and they will need to take advantage of people's

956
01:02:13,445 --> 01:02:16,845
Speaker 6:  appetite to buy. Right now every kid has a tablet. What do they need to switch

957
01:02:16,865 --> 01:02:20,815
Speaker 6:  for? So we'll see that's one of the pieces that's been reported

958
01:02:20,815 --> 01:02:23,895
Speaker 6:  about the timing is that they're waiting for volume

959
01:02:24,675 --> 01:02:28,415
Speaker 6:  to be ready. They have released a couple little nuggets and

960
01:02:28,485 --> 01:02:32,455
Speaker 6:  just for the calendar enthusiasts out there, you know who you

961
01:02:32,455 --> 01:02:36,335
Speaker 6:  are. October, 2016 they announced the switch

962
01:02:36,515 --> 01:02:40,175
Speaker 6:  Switch came out the following year, April, there was no October

963
01:02:40,495 --> 01:02:43,615
Speaker 6:  announcement this year. Right. It has not been announced yet. They have announced

964
01:02:43,675 --> 01:02:47,575
Speaker 6:  in a sort of like to shareholders way that there is a successor to the

965
01:02:47,575 --> 01:02:50,935
Speaker 6:  console and their hard work on it and that they will announce more when ready.

966
01:02:51,565 --> 01:02:54,735
Speaker 6:  Okay. They, they dropped one weird little nugget of news

967
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:59,175
Speaker 6:  maybe like a month or so ago, which was like random at night and it was just

968
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,135
Speaker 6:  like the switch successor will play switch software.

969
01:03:01,395 --> 01:03:03,495
Speaker 1:  Oh yeah. That was like on election day. Yeah.

970
01:03:03,515 --> 01:03:04,615
Speaker 6:  Yes. Right. Yes.

971
01:03:04,685 --> 01:03:05,935
Speaker 1:  Like thanks Nintendo.

972
01:03:06,245 --> 01:03:09,425
Speaker 6:  What a weird drop. What a like Yeah.

973
01:03:10,035 --> 01:03:13,385
Speaker 6:  Again, for the calendar enthusiast, you're looking at a calendar. What day

974
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:18,425
Speaker 6:  should we pick to put this piece in this, which is generally good news, why

975
01:03:18,425 --> 01:03:21,385
Speaker 6:  would you not trumpet it? I'll say, and I'll say this about the successorship.

976
01:03:22,305 --> 01:03:25,945
Speaker 6:  Nintendo has somewhat of a reputation, especially in modern times of following

977
01:03:25,945 --> 01:03:29,585
Speaker 6:  up consoles that are hits with flops or duds or disappointments. Let's say

978
01:03:30,255 --> 01:03:33,825
Speaker 6:  most notably you have the Super Nintendo followed up with the N 64.

979
01:03:35,495 --> 01:03:39,105
Speaker 6:  There's a little bit of a back to back N 64, at least from a sales standpoint,

980
01:03:39,265 --> 01:03:43,145
Speaker 6:  followed up by the game Cube X. Although game cube heads no good

981
01:03:43,145 --> 01:03:43,385
Speaker 6:  console

982
01:03:43,895 --> 01:03:47,865
Speaker 1:  Also N 60, this is like N 64 slander I was not prepared for and will not

983
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,705
Speaker 1:  acknowledge. But we can just move past that.

984
01:03:50,185 --> 01:03:52,505
Speaker 6:  I have an N 64 right here. Okay.

985
01:03:52,645 --> 01:03:54,345
Speaker 1:  All right then we're, we're cool. All right. With

986
01:03:54,345 --> 01:03:58,305
Speaker 6:  Library games, I'm gonna not, but if you're gonna prioritize and rank

987
01:03:58,325 --> 01:04:02,065
Speaker 6:  the best Nintendo consoles of all time inclusive of the virtual

988
01:04:02,285 --> 01:04:04,865
Speaker 6:  boy, the Nintendo 64 is still gonna be low on that list.

989
01:04:04,865 --> 01:04:07,665
Speaker 1:  That's fair. I mean, but the most recent one right, is like I've heard a

990
01:04:07,665 --> 01:04:10,465
Speaker 1:  lot of people say like we, we you. Right. Huge

991
01:04:11,665 --> 01:04:14,265
Speaker 1:  revolutionary hit followed by big

992
01:04:14,265 --> 01:04:14,545
Speaker 6:  Flop,

993
01:04:14,715 --> 01:04:16,825
Speaker 1:  Weird new idea on top of it that didn't work.

994
01:04:17,265 --> 01:04:20,545
Speaker 6:  A big flop. And I actually went back before this podcast and read some of

995
01:04:20,545 --> 01:04:24,185
Speaker 6:  my weu coverage from their launch event in New York. And the piece that I

996
01:04:24,185 --> 01:04:28,145
Speaker 6:  was the most upset by, the most frustrated by the most

997
01:04:28,145 --> 01:04:32,105
Speaker 6:  sort of like incredulous about was the absence of

998
01:04:32,845 --> 01:04:36,545
Speaker 6:  an online service. Hmm. They announced the EU and they said, we'll make an

999
01:04:36,545 --> 01:04:39,985
Speaker 6:  online service. You can't No it's 2013

1000
01:04:41,405 --> 01:04:45,225
Speaker 6:  GTA five is coming out. Like you can't, you need it now. You need it yesterday.

1001
01:04:45,245 --> 01:04:48,705
Speaker 6:  In fact, it's an embarrassment. Xbox Live has been out for a decade.

1002
01:04:49,255 --> 01:04:52,745
Speaker 6:  Like just kind of a bizarre omission and they weren't able to do it. They

1003
01:04:52,745 --> 01:04:56,425
Speaker 6:  partnered with a third party and we use struggled with that absence of an

1004
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:59,345
Speaker 6:  online function. There was different systems, there was your Nintendo network

1005
01:04:59,685 --> 01:05:03,505
Speaker 6:  ID and other stuff, but it wasn't until Switch online that had something

1006
01:05:03,505 --> 01:05:07,385
Speaker 6:  that feels modern, right. That you could go onto. One of my examples

1007
01:05:07,385 --> 01:05:10,145
Speaker 6:  that I used in this piece from 2013 is that if I buy a book on a Kindle and

1008
01:05:10,145 --> 01:05:13,505
Speaker 6:  I lose my Kindle, I just get a new Kindle in my books there. Right. This

1009
01:05:13,505 --> 01:05:17,065
Speaker 6:  is something that most consumers understand. What was crazy about

1010
01:05:17,165 --> 01:05:21,125
Speaker 6:  Nintendo until the switch, the switch is even a little bit goofy with this,

1011
01:05:21,145 --> 01:05:25,045
Speaker 6:  but it's okay. Three Ds and Ds, there are

1012
01:05:25,045 --> 01:05:28,205
Speaker 6:  two portable consoles, three Ds also from a sales standpoint and from an

1013
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:31,325
Speaker 6:  audience I think standpoint and critical standpoint, a disappointment relative

1014
01:05:31,325 --> 01:05:35,285
Speaker 6:  to the Ds. The Ds and threes were portable

1015
01:05:35,285 --> 01:05:39,085
Speaker 6:  consoles largely targeted at children or

1016
01:05:39,085 --> 01:05:43,005
Speaker 6:  younger people let's say. And If you lost it, can

1017
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:46,685
Speaker 6:  you imagine a kid losing something? Never, never happened. Purely hypothetically.

1018
01:05:46,685 --> 01:05:50,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah. If you lost it and you had digital games that you

1019
01:05:50,605 --> 01:05:54,505
Speaker 6:  purchased, they were gone to tied

1020
01:05:54,505 --> 01:05:58,395
Speaker 6:  to the console. What like

1021
01:05:58,395 --> 01:06:01,835
Speaker 6:  what? I would never buy I, to this day, I don't buy Nintendo games digitally,

1022
01:06:02,235 --> 01:06:05,635
Speaker 6:  I just don't, I'm like, I'm, I don't know, I'm old, I have a lot of physical

1023
01:06:05,635 --> 01:06:09,235
Speaker 6:  games 'cause I'm also old. But also I just, I don't trust them still. And

1024
01:06:09,235 --> 01:06:12,475
Speaker 6:  so this announcement that my switch games would carry forward was like Huh,

1025
01:06:12,785 --> 01:06:16,635
Speaker 6:  okay. Huh. Yeah. Maybe it is okay to buy Nintendo games digitally.

1026
01:06:16,635 --> 01:06:20,115
Speaker 6:  Now maybe my purchases through Nintendo are

1027
01:06:20,575 --> 01:06:24,355
Speaker 6:  in some cases like Sacreds maybe too strong of a word but like respected

1028
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:28,555
Speaker 6:  in a way that I expect them to be. And this has not happened over some generations,

1029
01:06:28,555 --> 01:06:32,505
Speaker 6:  right? Your, not all of your 360 games work on your Xbox

1030
01:06:32,505 --> 01:06:35,945
Speaker 6:  Series X, but a lot of them do and it does feel like they try and that's

1031
01:06:35,945 --> 01:06:39,585
Speaker 6:  been newer for them. But going forward I think to some sense

1032
01:06:40,055 --> 01:06:43,785
Speaker 6:  your expectation that the things that you purchase digitally will

1033
01:06:43,885 --> 01:06:47,825
Speaker 6:  retain their value over time and will have forward compatibility. The idea

1034
01:06:47,825 --> 01:06:51,345
Speaker 6:  that backwards compatibility is backwards thinking to use. I think that was

1035
01:06:51,565 --> 01:06:55,465
Speaker 6:  Don Matrix dumbass quote. Yeah. It's not great.

1036
01:06:55,975 --> 01:06:58,625
Speaker 6:  It's not just that, it's not backwards thinking. It's the way games work

1037
01:06:58,675 --> 01:07:02,545
Speaker 6:  today. They have to be, they have your stuff has to carry forward.

1038
01:07:03,015 --> 01:07:06,865
Speaker 6:  This is how and what consumer expectations are. And So I think for

1039
01:07:06,865 --> 01:07:09,985
Speaker 6:  Nintendo that was a huge piece of news that I don't wanna diminish. It was

1040
01:07:10,025 --> 01:07:13,815
Speaker 6:  a tiny weird drop on election day. But the idea

1041
01:07:13,815 --> 01:07:17,415
Speaker 6:  that they're thinking about that suggests to me that they are thinking in

1042
01:07:17,415 --> 01:07:20,375
Speaker 6:  a forward capacity about how people think about their software and their

1043
01:07:20,575 --> 01:07:24,215
Speaker 6:  purchases. They're thinking about it as a successor and not to Nintendo consoles

1044
01:07:24,215 --> 01:07:27,935
Speaker 6:  but as a successor to the Switch, which is an important differentiation.

1045
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:32,695
Speaker 6:  This is not N 60 40 Game Cube or Game Cube to we.

1046
01:07:33,165 --> 01:07:36,975
Speaker 6:  This is more of a we to we you environment where they're keeping

1047
01:07:36,995 --> 01:07:40,775
Speaker 6:  the name there. They're anticipating some consumer adoption based on that

1048
01:07:40,775 --> 01:07:44,735
Speaker 6:  name. Your games will play the we you would play We games.

1049
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:48,655
Speaker 6:  It did drop the game Cube support. I I think saying that in the three

1050
01:07:48,675 --> 01:07:51,895
Speaker 6:  Ds played DS games. I think that if comparing it to the three Ds and the

1051
01:07:51,995 --> 01:07:55,415
Speaker 6:  Weu doesn't give you a lot of comfort, it doesn't make you feel super

1052
01:07:55,565 --> 01:07:59,335
Speaker 6:  confident. My hope here is that they try

1053
01:07:59,515 --> 01:08:02,335
Speaker 6:  not to reinvent the wheel and some of the reporting suggests it will still

1054
01:08:02,335 --> 01:08:05,295
Speaker 6:  be a portable console that will be able to be dock

1055
01:08:06,285 --> 01:08:10,055
Speaker 6:  that it has a bigger screen which like maybe that's weird. It's already

1056
01:08:10,055 --> 01:08:13,495
Speaker 6:  kind of a big portable but so is the steam deck and I carry that around.

1057
01:08:13,495 --> 01:08:17,245
Speaker 6:  So maybe it's fine that it will have detachable controllers

1058
01:08:17,825 --> 01:08:21,405
Speaker 6:  if this sounds familiar. That should be comforting because

1059
01:08:22,035 --> 01:08:25,205
Speaker 6:  it's a bigger switch with maybe some better hardware and some different games.

1060
01:08:25,205 --> 01:08:25,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1061
01:08:25,675 --> 01:08:28,685
Speaker 1:  I've really come around to that actually being my ideal outcome. I don't

1062
01:08:28,685 --> 01:08:31,965
Speaker 1:  know how you feel but for me, like I, I still play the Switch a lot and

1063
01:08:33,265 --> 01:08:36,845
Speaker 1:  the more I use it, the more I'm like okay this thing plus faster

1064
01:08:36,995 --> 01:08:40,845
Speaker 1:  processor, presumably more efficient chip so

1065
01:08:40,845 --> 01:08:44,685
Speaker 1:  it'll last a little longer. Better. Wifi is actually like the

1066
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:47,445
Speaker 1:  most important one for me 'cause the wifi chip in this thing is old and bad

1067
01:08:47,505 --> 01:08:51,405
Speaker 1:  and just does not work very well and like maybe an

1068
01:08:51,405 --> 01:08:54,565
Speaker 1:  upgraded screen. But honestly even that is like relatively low on my list

1069
01:08:54,665 --> 01:08:58,605
Speaker 1:  is like, there's very little else I want from this like tweak everything,

1070
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:02,365
Speaker 1:  upgrade all the parts to newer versions of those parts and keep it a switch

1071
01:09:03,495 --> 01:09:05,645
Speaker 1:  feels to me like what I'm looking for.

1072
01:09:06,365 --> 01:09:09,925
Speaker 6:  I would like the following things. I'd like it to be more durable. Mm.

1073
01:09:10,235 --> 01:09:10,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

1074
01:09:11,445 --> 01:09:14,325
Speaker 6:  The Joycons are China a nightmare

1075
01:09:15,705 --> 01:09:19,325
Speaker 6:  if anyone has kids in their household. I don't wanna say how many times I've

1076
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:23,245
Speaker 6:  taken apart a JoyCon and replaced and fixed parts of it. Yeah,

1077
01:09:23,245 --> 01:09:27,205
Speaker 6:  it's very tiny and those screws are very small and it's all very

1078
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:30,325
Speaker 6:  tightly packed in there and I'm pretty good at that stuff. But

1079
01:09:31,175 --> 01:09:34,835
Speaker 6:  can I say the F word on this podcast? Is that loud? Sure. Fuck the Joycons.

1080
01:09:35,075 --> 01:09:38,635
Speaker 6:  I don't wanna see 'em again. Do not bring them back. I don't want get rid

1081
01:09:38,635 --> 01:09:42,235
Speaker 6:  of them. Stop the JoyCon shit. Gimme a better analog stick.

1082
01:09:42,295 --> 01:09:45,815
Speaker 6:  Please give me, get rid of the IR Port

1083
01:09:46,525 --> 01:09:50,335
Speaker 6:  Labo community. I see you. I don't mean any disrespect. Labo

1084
01:09:50,335 --> 01:09:54,055
Speaker 6:  is incredible. Everyone else got it wrong. We knew it was good. However,

1085
01:09:55,155 --> 01:09:58,335
Speaker 6:  get rid of the IR port. Get rid of the complexity. Lower the cost of those

1086
01:09:58,335 --> 01:09:58,535
Speaker 6:  things.

1087
01:10:00,745 --> 01:10:03,715
Speaker 6:  Make it more durable. Yeah. This is a console that you're gonna be thrown

1088
01:10:03,715 --> 01:10:07,435
Speaker 6:  in your bag. Why is it so fragile? Why are things so wiggly?

1089
01:10:08,155 --> 01:10:11,995
Speaker 6:  So I would love to see it beefed up. I would love to see multiple switches

1090
01:10:12,535 --> 01:10:16,355
Speaker 6:  and your profile travel better. Mm. If you have two switches in your house,

1091
01:10:17,165 --> 01:10:21,155
Speaker 6:  going between them is not a nice affair. It does not feel

1092
01:10:21,225 --> 01:10:24,475
Speaker 6:  good. And I think a lot of families now

1093
01:10:25,345 --> 01:10:25,995
Speaker 6:  have a lot of

1094
01:10:26,275 --> 01:10:29,035
Speaker 1:  Switches. I was about to make fun of you for being like the only person on

1095
01:10:29,035 --> 01:10:32,035
Speaker 1:  earth who's like worried about managing multiple switches. But you are probably

1096
01:10:32,035 --> 01:10:34,635
Speaker 1:  right that there are, there are people out there for whom that's a real thing.

1097
01:10:34,955 --> 01:10:37,995
Speaker 6:  I know a lot of folks who have kids that have like a switch light. Mm. Yeah.

1098
01:10:37,995 --> 01:10:41,115
Speaker 6:  And then there's the switch at home. But why isn't, why is my game there?

1099
01:10:41,135 --> 01:10:43,955
Speaker 6:  Is it saved? Did it transfer? Is my saved file there? What's my thing? Do

1100
01:10:43,955 --> 01:10:46,595
Speaker 6:  I have to download this again? This is my home console, not my home console.

1101
01:10:46,655 --> 01:10:50,595
Speaker 6:  It gets like a bit goofy or it has to always be online if it's not the home

1102
01:10:50,595 --> 01:10:53,315
Speaker 6:  console, but then it's a switch like you're traveling with it. So there's

1103
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:56,635
Speaker 6:  just like some part of managing multiple consoles that I think,

1104
01:10:57,215 --> 01:10:59,835
Speaker 6:  you know, especially as these things last longer and people play the games

1105
01:10:59,835 --> 01:11:03,035
Speaker 6:  longer, like there should be some expectation of it. This gets into Nintendo's

1106
01:11:03,185 --> 01:11:06,755
Speaker 6:  profile management, software management part where I have some

1107
01:11:06,755 --> 01:11:10,305
Speaker 6:  confidence that they have radically improved. I think their, their

1108
01:11:10,385 --> 01:11:14,285
Speaker 6:  yearbook title would be most improved. Maybe it would.

1109
01:11:16,225 --> 01:11:19,605
Speaker 6:  But I think I really wanna see that. I think for the big

1110
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:23,925
Speaker 6:  open question for Switch, I, I don't know if it's or switch two, what are

1111
01:11:23,925 --> 01:11:27,185
Speaker 6:  they gonna call it? Polygons official vote is Super Switch. It's

1112
01:11:27,185 --> 01:11:29,905
Speaker 1:  Gotta be Super Switch is the, I don't think they will, but that is the correct

1113
01:11:29,905 --> 01:11:30,265
Speaker 1:  answer.

1114
01:11:31,085 --> 01:11:34,625
Speaker 6:  And the super should definitely be the super font from Super Nintendo. A

1115
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,265
Speaker 6:  hundred percent. That's the other part I'm gonna say out loud.

1116
01:11:36,635 --> 01:11:39,585
Speaker 1:  We're doing a retro thing in the world right now. Like go Go for it. Yeah,

1117
01:11:39,585 --> 01:11:42,305
Speaker 1:  go. We're all, we all live in the nineties again. Like let's just do it.

1118
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:42,905
Speaker 1:  I'm into it.

1119
01:11:43,095 --> 01:11:46,025
Speaker 6:  Look, I love the nineties and it turns out one of the things that younger

1120
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:49,065
Speaker 6:  folks and myself still have in common is they love the nineties now too.

1121
01:11:49,065 --> 01:11:49,305
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1122
01:11:49,725 --> 01:11:51,185
Speaker 1:  The nineties are so back man.

1123
01:11:51,255 --> 01:11:54,305
Speaker 6:  It's great. Yeah. So let's all just live it and do the super font please.

1124
01:11:54,495 --> 01:11:58,025
Speaker 6:  Amen. And then if it doesn't have a lot of secrets, it doesn't have a lot

1125
01:11:58,025 --> 01:12:00,905
Speaker 6:  of surprises. Right. When the, we came out, do you remember the Wes code

1126
01:12:00,905 --> 01:12:04,225
Speaker 6:  name revolution? Oh yeah. And everyone wanted to know what the revolution

1127
01:12:04,225 --> 01:12:07,905
Speaker 6:  was and there was, this was like 2005, so the internet was different back

1128
01:12:07,905 --> 01:12:11,865
Speaker 6:  then, but there was all these rumors and mockups and somebody found

1129
01:12:11,905 --> 01:12:14,945
Speaker 6:  a footage but the lighting is off and you can tell because the direction

1130
01:12:14,945 --> 01:12:17,985
Speaker 6:  of whatever, I don't think we have that this time because

1131
01:12:19,095 --> 01:12:21,785
Speaker 6:  it's probably just gonna be a big switch. It's gonna be a big switch with

1132
01:12:21,785 --> 01:12:25,665
Speaker 6:  some different things. And then is Nintendo, will they

1133
01:12:25,665 --> 01:12:28,905
Speaker 6:  feel compelled to add in a gau, a whizzbang?

1134
01:12:30,195 --> 01:12:34,155
Speaker 6:  I don't know. Is it gonna have like a big radio antenna on the back and

1135
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:37,955
Speaker 6:  it does ham radio too? I don't know. I have like no idea what the thing

1136
01:12:37,975 --> 01:12:41,635
Speaker 6:  is gonna be or will they just make it a better switch? Keep in mind the Weu

1137
01:12:41,785 --> 01:12:45,735
Speaker 6:  successor to the We all they had to do was make a faster we and they

1138
01:12:45,735 --> 01:12:49,175
Speaker 6:  added this goofball tablet that connected locally

1139
01:12:49,555 --> 01:12:53,415
Speaker 6:  Yep. To your console and it created this environment for asynchronous

1140
01:12:53,415 --> 01:12:56,655
Speaker 6:  gameplay, which was really cool. And then no games did that. It did give

1141
01:12:56,655 --> 01:13:00,495
Speaker 6:  them some of the insight into the switch, but like, okay. And then also it

1142
01:13:00,495 --> 01:13:04,455
Speaker 6:  was a like a cable box controller similar to the Xbox Run. Yeah.

1143
01:13:05,145 --> 01:13:08,935
Speaker 6:  Which again, both of those two don't. It wasn't just

1144
01:13:09,535 --> 01:13:12,935
Speaker 6:  Microsoft being dumb. Both of them were like Yeah, cable boxes, that's what

1145
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:16,575
Speaker 6:  kids love. Yeah. Right. I just actually asked the Polygon staff

1146
01:13:16,575 --> 01:13:19,855
Speaker 6:  yesterday who, who still had a cable subscription and the only people who

1147
01:13:19,855 --> 01:13:22,335
Speaker 6:  did it was only a handful of people and they have it for just sports. That's

1148
01:13:22,335 --> 01:13:25,655
Speaker 6:  it. Like everyone else has been a court, I've been a court coach since 2005

1149
01:13:25,795 --> 01:13:29,735
Speaker 6:  six. So we, you had some bonkers

1150
01:13:29,735 --> 01:13:33,655
Speaker 6:  ideas about what people wanted in a console and I'm hopeful that they don't

1151
01:13:33,925 --> 01:13:37,855
Speaker 6:  feel the urgency to like add something fancy. I will also

1152
01:13:37,855 --> 01:13:40,615
Speaker 6:  find one other thing. The Switch is not the best selling console ever. It

1153
01:13:40,615 --> 01:13:43,135
Speaker 6:  is the best selling Nintendo console ever. The best selling console is the

1154
01:13:43,135 --> 01:13:47,055
Speaker 6:  PlayStation two, but also the DS handheld is

1155
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:50,615
Speaker 6:  still a little bit over the switch. The switch may overtake it lifetime.

1156
01:13:50,665 --> 01:13:54,135
Speaker 6:  We'll see. But I do wanna find another really notable part about the Switch.

1157
01:13:54,155 --> 01:13:57,845
Speaker 6:  It has sold more software than any other Nintendo console.

1158
01:13:58,305 --> 01:14:01,725
Speaker 6:  The, we sold roughly a billion units of software. The Switch has sold

1159
01:14:01,745 --> 01:14:05,645
Speaker 6:  1.3 billion units of software. Wow. The DS sold about a billion units of

1160
01:14:05,845 --> 01:14:09,565
Speaker 6:  software too. But there's a, a timeline issue,

1161
01:14:10,065 --> 01:14:13,835
Speaker 6:  but the DS and the, we were out at the same time. So you sold

1162
01:14:13,995 --> 01:14:17,715
Speaker 6:  a ton of hardware units, you sold a ton of software units and you had

1163
01:14:17,855 --> 01:14:21,835
Speaker 6:  two hardware lines and Nintendo consolidated those in the switch. So

1164
01:14:21,835 --> 01:14:24,835
Speaker 6:  again, for the Switch to be successful, it had to be, this was a consolidation

1165
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:28,075
Speaker 6:  of two businesses into one the handheld in the console business.

1166
01:14:28,975 --> 01:14:29,635
Speaker 6:  And it did

1167
01:14:54,355 --> 01:14:57,835
Speaker 6:  they continue to consolidate this market and from handheld to console

1168
01:14:58,655 --> 01:15:02,515
Speaker 6:  is how do they again keep not only the audience it has,

1169
01:15:03,455 --> 01:15:06,995
Speaker 6:  but continue to grow audience. And some of that means being

1170
01:15:06,995 --> 01:15:10,595
Speaker 6:  increasingly competitive in a world full of these other games

1171
01:15:10,645 --> 01:15:13,835
Speaker 6:  we're talking about. So I think modernization

1172
01:15:14,715 --> 01:15:15,635
Speaker 6:  is something Nintendo

1173
01:15:22,315 --> 01:15:22,995
Speaker 6:  So do you

1174
01:15:22,995 --> 01:15:26,915
Speaker 1:  Feel like this next era for Nintendo is more

1175
01:15:26,985 --> 01:15:30,395
Speaker 1:  competitive because there is this huge

1176
01:15:31,185 --> 01:15:34,955
Speaker 1:  upswing in the Steam deck and these other kind of handheld game systems

1177
01:15:34,955 --> 01:15:38,315
Speaker 1:  that are starting to come out and do really well? Or is Nintendo as ever

1178
01:15:38,345 --> 01:15:40,515
Speaker 1:  just kind of like overhear doing Nintendo things?

1179
01:15:43,195 --> 01:15:46,795
Speaker 6:  Nintendo will always be over here doing Nintendo things. Okay. Like they

1180
01:15:46,795 --> 01:15:47,715
Speaker 6:  can't help themselves.

1181
01:15:48,285 --> 01:15:51,955
Speaker 1:  Right. And I do think to your point about doing all the weirdness, like one

1182
01:15:51,955 --> 01:15:55,755
Speaker 1:  of the things I have wondered about is if things like Alarm O

1183
01:15:55,895 --> 01:15:58,835
Speaker 1:  and this museum and all this stuff is like Nintendo is putting its weird

1184
01:15:58,835 --> 01:16:01,555
Speaker 1:  energy on that stuff so that it can keep the switch

1185
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:03,195
Speaker 1:  non-insane.

1186
01:16:03,755 --> 01:16:04,995
Speaker 6:  I like that. That's a fun idea.

1187
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:08,115
Speaker 1:  I have no evidence for that theory, but it's kind of what it feels like to

1188
01:16:08,115 --> 01:16:08,635
Speaker 1:  me. The

1189
01:16:08,635 --> 01:16:10,715
Speaker 6:  Theme parks. Yeah. Right. Like, you

1190
01:16:10,715 --> 01:16:14,195
Speaker 1:  Know, like all the people here we've hired to just do whatever. Yep. They

1191
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:17,835
Speaker 1:  now do it over there and then the switch just gets to be the switch. You

1192
01:16:17,835 --> 01:16:17,955
Speaker 1:  do

1193
01:16:17,955 --> 01:16:21,475
Speaker 6:  Hear some reporting and, and some Nten people in me and Mud will talk about

1194
01:16:21,475 --> 01:16:24,915
Speaker 6:  the younger designers at Nintendo, right. The younger designers get a lot

1195
01:16:24,915 --> 01:16:27,915
Speaker 6:  of credit for Platoon for this platoon series, which has its own

1196
01:16:28,635 --> 01:16:32,405
Speaker 6:  just totally perfect vibe. And the Switch

1197
01:16:32,405 --> 01:16:35,805
Speaker 6:  gets some credit from the younger designers. And So I think that there is

1198
01:16:35,805 --> 01:16:39,285
Speaker 6:  some world in which as the old guard at Nintendo gets older and

1199
01:16:39,645 --> 01:16:43,565
Speaker 6:  older, even though Miyamoto doesn't appear to age true

1200
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:47,565
Speaker 6:  I think. But as they get older and older, like there are younger folks

1201
01:16:47,565 --> 01:16:50,125
Speaker 6:  in there who are coming with a different point of view and different set

1202
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:54,045
Speaker 6:  of expectations who can drive the business and the products they make towards

1203
01:16:54,045 --> 01:16:57,685
Speaker 6:  an audience that is going to be more compatible with that

1204
01:16:57,845 --> 01:17:01,285
Speaker 6:  sensibility. And so maybe there is some world in which those weird experiments

1205
01:17:01,305 --> 01:17:04,085
Speaker 6:  go to the side and the weird experiments are still part of what makes Nintendo,

1206
01:17:04,085 --> 01:17:06,845
Speaker 6:  Nintendo and I, I think that even some of the games like when the, when the

1207
01:17:06,845 --> 01:17:10,805
Speaker 6:  switch came out, one two switch, like I, I miss some of the goofball

1208
01:17:10,975 --> 01:17:14,925
Speaker 6:  again, Labo, I miss some of these goofball exercises

1209
01:17:14,945 --> 01:17:18,885
Speaker 6:  and I would really dread having Nintendo product come out with just

1210
01:17:19,425 --> 01:17:23,085
Speaker 6:  AAA metric Prime game, aaa, Mario Game, AAA

1211
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:27,405
Speaker 6:  Zelda game. And that's all great. But what's exciting about Nintendo products

1212
01:17:27,465 --> 01:17:30,605
Speaker 6:  are the weird one two switches or Snipper clips or

1213
01:17:31,955 --> 01:17:34,965
Speaker 6:  Labo. Yeah. And So I, I don't

1214
01:17:35,795 --> 01:17:39,045
Speaker 6:  want to disabuse them of any of that whimsy,

1215
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:43,605
Speaker 6:  but I worry again about integrating a pinwheel

1216
01:17:44,155 --> 01:17:48,085
Speaker 6:  into the console and like understandable trying to make that

1217
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:51,475
Speaker 6:  a thing. So we'll see. I think it will have some

1218
01:17:51,915 --> 01:17:55,755
Speaker 6:  surprises in store is my guess. Whether they're going to add value

1219
01:17:56,415 --> 01:17:59,875
Speaker 6:  or be a distraction is a bigger question. But I'm, I'm pretty confident Switch

1220
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:02,035
Speaker 6:  too will just be a a, a good or switch.

1221
01:18:02,735 --> 01:18:06,595
Speaker 1:  Boy, I hope so. A good or switch is, is truly all I

1222
01:18:06,595 --> 01:18:10,075
Speaker 1:  need in 2025. All right Chris, we gotta take a break, but thank you for doing

1223
01:18:10,075 --> 01:18:10,755
Speaker 1:  this. Good to have you back.

1224
01:18:11,055 --> 01:18:11,475
Speaker 6:  Thanks.

1225
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:16,635
Speaker 1:  All right, we gotta take one more break and then we have a much requested

1226
01:18:16,635 --> 01:18:18,835
Speaker 1:  hotline that I'm very excited about. We'll be right back.

1227
01:21:21,665 --> 01:21:23,925
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the hotline.

1228
01:21:24,435 --> 01:21:28,365
Speaker 2:  This week's Vergecast hotline is brought to you by Amazon Queue, the new

1229
01:21:28,365 --> 01:21:30,845
Speaker 2:  generative AI assistant from AWS

Speaker 1:  As always. The number is 8 6 6 VERGE one one. The email is

1231
01:21:35,435 --> 01:21:38,715
Speaker 1:  vergecast at The Verge dot com. We love all of your questions. We've gotten

1232
01:21:38,915 --> 01:21:42,835
Speaker 1:  a bunch more great ones after the meta show we did last week that I think

1233
01:21:42,835 --> 01:21:45,355
Speaker 1:  have been really interesting and I look forward to finding a way to answer.

1234
01:21:45,955 --> 01:21:49,835
Speaker 1:  I will say we're taking a couple of weeks off after this week so we're not

1235
01:21:49,835 --> 01:21:52,915
Speaker 1:  gonna have a ton of time to do hotline stuff, but we're also gonna do a bunch

1236
01:21:52,915 --> 01:21:56,115
Speaker 1:  of fun catch up stuff in January and we will not lose track of your questions

1237
01:21:56,115 --> 01:21:59,355
Speaker 1:  so please keep them coming. All of your

1238
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:02,875
Speaker 1:  weirdest tech questions, if you're ever like, huh, I want just pick up the

1239
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:06,435
Speaker 1:  phone and call us or send us an email. 8 6 6 verse one one. The email is

1240
01:22:06,555 --> 01:22:10,235
Speaker 1:  Vergecast at verse.com. This week's hotline comes from

1241
01:22:10,555 --> 01:22:14,155
Speaker 1:  I would say a a semi throwaway line in last week's meta

1242
01:22:14,155 --> 01:22:18,035
Speaker 1:  episode that came up a whole bunch and it's time to dig

1243
01:22:18,035 --> 01:22:19,515
Speaker 1:  back into it. Let's hear it.

1244
01:22:21,015 --> 01:22:24,795
Speaker 8:  Hi, my name is Chris and I'm on vacation right now in the

1245
01:22:24,935 --> 01:22:28,715
Speaker 8:  United Kingdom and I was just kind of like

1246
01:22:28,715 --> 01:22:32,635
Speaker 8:  listening on the plane, whatever and I heard Helen have black talk about

1247
01:22:32,855 --> 01:22:36,635
Speaker 8:  her garden design in Figma and like what the,

1248
01:22:36,635 --> 01:22:40,195
Speaker 8:  like I gotta know about this. Like come I'm a designer

1249
01:22:41,445 --> 01:22:44,835
Speaker 8:  using Figma. It's a great tool. Like tell me about one time about your car.

1250
01:22:45,065 --> 01:22:46,795
Speaker 8:  Mama wants to know. Thanks so much

1251
01:22:47,635 --> 01:22:49,585
Speaker 1:  Helen Haack, welcome back. Thank you

1252
01:22:49,585 --> 01:22:51,945
Speaker 9:  So much. It's been so long. One entire week

1253
01:22:52,285 --> 01:22:56,065
Speaker 1:  We got so much of this like I sort of assumed there would be someone

1254
01:22:56,245 --> 01:23:00,025
Speaker 1:  who was like, oh I am also a gardening sicko and I want to know what

1255
01:23:00,025 --> 01:23:03,425
Speaker 1:  Helen is up to. But we got, we got more of this than I expected so it's,

1256
01:23:03,425 --> 01:23:04,705
Speaker 1:  it was just time to do this with you.

1257
01:23:05,405 --> 01:23:09,365
Speaker 9:  I now feel extra guilty for having drafted this how to

1258
01:23:09,365 --> 01:23:13,165
Speaker 9:  guide for Barbara to publish on The Verge dot com in 2023

1259
01:23:13,265 --> 01:23:17,045
Speaker 9:  and then never publishing it. I am sorry worlds that I did not give you

1260
01:23:17,045 --> 01:23:19,365
Speaker 9:  this weird and highly specific content. The

1261
01:23:19,365 --> 01:23:23,045
Speaker 1:  World clearly needs this in a way that I did not understand until this

1262
01:23:23,285 --> 01:23:27,205
Speaker 1:  past week. So let's, let's just dive in. I, I

1263
01:23:27,205 --> 01:23:30,005
Speaker 1:  don't even know where to start because all of this is so outrageously foreign

1264
01:23:30,025 --> 01:23:33,725
Speaker 1:  to me. So how did it come to pass that you are a Figma

1265
01:23:33,725 --> 01:23:34,205
Speaker 1:  gardener?

1266
01:23:34,945 --> 01:23:38,765
Speaker 9:  Yes. Well David, it's a, you might think it's a little weird that we're talking

1267
01:23:38,775 --> 01:23:42,445
Speaker 9:  about gardening here it late December, but

1268
01:23:42,725 --> 01:23:46,085
Speaker 9:  actually the timing is perfect. We are approaching the darkest day of the

1269
01:23:46,085 --> 01:23:49,565
Speaker 9:  year and what anyone who is a gardener knows is that you do actual

1270
01:23:49,565 --> 01:23:52,965
Speaker 9:  gardening from like March to November, you've got spring planning,

1271
01:23:53,665 --> 01:23:57,445
Speaker 9:  but from December to like February you were in pure fantasy

1272
01:23:57,445 --> 01:24:01,205
Speaker 9:  gardening. This is when you, all of your gardening energy is completely

1273
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:05,045
Speaker 9:  thwarted. You can't do shit outside the ground is frozen. Okay? So what you

1274
01:24:05,045 --> 01:24:08,725
Speaker 9:  do is you fantasize, this is when you like read gardening books, which you

1275
01:24:08,725 --> 01:24:12,605
Speaker 9:  would never do in the summertime. This is when you draw plans for your garden

1276
01:24:13,385 --> 01:24:16,965
Speaker 9:  and think about what you're gonna do when it's not dark and depressing outside.

1277
01:24:16,965 --> 01:24:17,365
Speaker 9:  You're

1278
01:24:17,365 --> 01:24:19,405
Speaker 1:  Like a professional athlete in the off season basically.

1279
01:24:19,585 --> 01:24:23,485
Speaker 9:  So timing is perfect. Okay, so how did this come about? Well I bought a house

1280
01:24:23,485 --> 01:24:26,685
Speaker 9:  in 2022. It had a very kinda like formal

1281
01:24:26,815 --> 01:24:30,325
Speaker 9:  foundation planting that we were not super into and we were thinking about

1282
01:24:30,345 --> 01:24:34,245
Speaker 9:  how to expand it, plant more plants. I went full like native

1283
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:37,405
Speaker 9:  plant rabbit hole, some very into like native plants

1284
01:24:38,385 --> 01:24:41,605
Speaker 9:  and my husband Phil and I were talking about what we wanted to plant and

1285
01:24:41,605 --> 01:24:44,045
Speaker 9:  we needed to come up with a plan for what we were gonna put in the ground

1286
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:47,565
Speaker 9:  and therefore what did we need to buy and really what did we need to buy

1287
01:24:47,675 --> 01:24:51,485
Speaker 9:  when like native plant trust pre-orders went live, which is usually like

1288
01:24:51,485 --> 01:24:51,925
Speaker 9:  late January

1289
01:24:52,285 --> 01:24:55,605
Speaker 1:  February. Is that like a big moment? Like is it a, is it a Taylor Swift on

1290
01:24:55,605 --> 01:24:57,685
Speaker 1:  Ticketmaster kind of situation that we're talking about here?

1291
01:24:59,405 --> 01:25:03,325
Speaker 9:  Probably not David, but I should also set a, a set

1292
01:25:03,325 --> 01:25:06,805
Speaker 9:  the stage that I am not a professional gardener. I'm a very

1293
01:25:06,915 --> 01:25:10,685
Speaker 9:  amateur gardener and what I have is some books I have read Boundless

1294
01:25:10,925 --> 01:25:14,445
Speaker 9:  Enthusiasm and no practical gardening experience whatsoever.

1295
01:25:14,545 --> 01:25:14,965
Speaker 9:  That's

1296
01:25:15,045 --> 01:25:15,325
Speaker 1:  The dream.

1297
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:18,885
Speaker 9:  But my husband and I were, you know, trying to figure out where did we wanna

1298
01:25:18,885 --> 01:25:22,685
Speaker 9:  plan for what we were going to do and he's a front end web

1299
01:25:22,685 --> 01:25:26,405
Speaker 9:  developer, Phil if I, I'm not mentioning his name. And so we were looking

1300
01:25:26,405 --> 01:25:30,205
Speaker 9:  at, okay, is there a good software that will help us do this together? And

1301
01:25:30,275 --> 01:25:33,965
Speaker 9:  what we were looking for is something free. We didn't, you know,

1302
01:25:33,965 --> 01:25:37,765
Speaker 9:  we're not landscape architects, we didn't want really expensive seats on

1303
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:40,885
Speaker 9:  a software program designed for total professionals I think many of whom

1304
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:44,765
Speaker 9:  use like SketchUp or other things. We wanted something that was collaborative.

1305
01:25:44,905 --> 01:25:48,725
Speaker 9:  We could work across both of our devices and not have to have like

1306
01:25:48,865 --> 01:25:52,725
Speaker 9:  access is issues. There's some guarding software out there that have

1307
01:25:52,725 --> 01:25:56,525
Speaker 9:  like component libraries but a lot of those have like really generic plants

1308
01:25:56,625 --> 01:26:00,205
Speaker 9:  and not a lot of good like local ecotype and native plants.

1309
01:26:00,705 --> 01:26:02,285
Speaker 9:  So we wanted to be able to put our own plants

1310
01:26:02,285 --> 01:26:06,245
Speaker 1:  In. So in those you're kind of like dragging clip art onto a thing

1311
01:26:06,315 --> 01:26:07,565
Speaker 1:  with some of those. Yeah. Okay.

1312
01:26:07,785 --> 01:26:10,645
Speaker 9:  So we needed to be able to put our own plants into the system

1313
01:26:11,905 --> 01:26:15,845
Speaker 9:  and you know a lot of times you do this fantasy gardening

1314
01:26:15,845 --> 01:26:18,805
Speaker 9:  and then you're outside and you have to actually place the plants and so

1315
01:26:18,805 --> 01:26:22,485
Speaker 9:  we wanted something that had a reasonably good mobile experience and so

1316
01:26:22,675 --> 01:26:26,485
Speaker 9:  that is how we landed upon the weird choice of actually Figma

1317
01:26:26,865 --> 01:26:29,925
Speaker 9:  was good enough for us to do all of the things we wanted to do in the free

1318
01:26:29,925 --> 01:26:31,925
Speaker 9:  version of Figma pretty quickly.

1319
01:26:32,555 --> 01:26:36,125
Speaker 1:  Okay. Was there a, was there a another set of

1320
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:39,565
Speaker 1:  possibilities that you almost came to? 'cause I feel like with that number

1321
01:26:39,585 --> 01:26:43,565
Speaker 1:  of constraints, I can't actually think of all that many things that

1322
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:44,005
Speaker 1:  would work.

1323
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:47,965
Speaker 9:  You know, I looked at some Reddits for like what are, what is gardening

1324
01:26:48,325 --> 01:26:50,885
Speaker 9:  software? There's some that are owned by like plant

1325
01:26:51,475 --> 01:26:54,965
Speaker 9:  manufacturers but that's where you run into like the plant library

1326
01:26:55,255 --> 01:26:59,125
Speaker 9:  isn't deep enough. There's some cool startups doing interesting things in

1327
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:02,885
Speaker 9:  this place, in this space. I'm gonna be real with you. I did not do an

1328
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:06,725
Speaker 9:  exhaustive research of all the software before Phil and I were like,

1329
01:27:07,145 --> 01:27:10,725
Speaker 9:  you know what actually what about Figma? And Figma was good enough to do

1330
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:12,125
Speaker 9:  all the things we wanted to do. Okay.

1331
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:15,885
Speaker 1:  Were you good at Figma going in? Because I feel like Figma

1332
01:27:16,455 --> 01:27:20,445
Speaker 1:  Figma slightly terrifies me. I'm pretty good at like moving around in

1333
01:27:20,495 --> 01:27:24,045
Speaker 1:  Figma but even that took some work and the idea of like really setting this

1334
01:27:24,045 --> 01:27:26,245
Speaker 1:  thing up successfully is slightly terrifying.

1335
01:27:26,385 --> 01:27:30,005
Speaker 9:  No, I think key to this is that I am not expert in Figma. Okay. All of where

1336
01:27:30,085 --> 01:27:33,845
Speaker 9:  I am in Figma usually is reviewing design files that someone else has created.

1337
01:27:34,465 --> 01:27:38,405
Speaker 9:  The Verge has an incredibly talented design team and So

1338
01:27:38,405 --> 01:27:41,125
Speaker 9:  I've looked at plenty of Will Joel's Figma. Yeah. And I was like if Will

1339
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:43,885
Speaker 9:  Joel thinks Figma is good enough, it's probably good enough for me. But key

1340
01:27:43,885 --> 01:27:47,845
Speaker 9:  to this is I am not a Figma pro and you can get pretty far in

1341
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:51,725
Speaker 9:  garden design with like very little specific Figma

1342
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:52,245
Speaker 9:  expertise.

1343
01:27:53,145 --> 01:27:57,045
Speaker 1:  That's, that's good. That's encouraging to hear. So this is tough

1344
01:27:57,045 --> 01:28:00,245
Speaker 1:  to do on a podcast for a visual design application that you're talking about,

1345
01:28:00,245 --> 01:28:03,325
Speaker 1:  but describe the Figma a little bit. What is it, how does it actually work?

1346
01:28:03,675 --> 01:28:07,005
Speaker 9:  Okay, so you make a free Figma count, it's very easy. You start a new project

1347
01:28:07,145 --> 01:28:10,285
Speaker 9:  that's very easy. It works exactly like you would think. It's the one pain

1348
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,845
Speaker 9:  in the ass. Part of this whole process is

1349
01:28:13,915 --> 01:28:17,445
Speaker 9:  importing your plan and determining a scale. Unlike

1350
01:28:18,045 --> 01:28:21,805
Speaker 9:  a architecture design program, Figma does not work in

1351
01:28:21,805 --> 01:28:25,445
Speaker 9:  like inches or some of the conventions of like one eighth

1352
01:28:25,515 --> 01:28:29,405
Speaker 9:  inch printed equals whatever. Like that's not how Figma works. Figma

1353
01:28:29,405 --> 01:28:33,205
Speaker 9:  works in pixels. So you have to arbitrarily kind of set up

1354
01:28:33,205 --> 01:28:37,015
Speaker 9:  your place in what you are working and decide what your scale

1355
01:28:37,075 --> 01:28:40,855
Speaker 9:  is gonna be. What we did is we took a PDF of

1356
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:44,615
Speaker 9:  our home design. It was pretty basic. A lot of people might have this from

1357
01:28:44,815 --> 01:28:47,375
Speaker 9:  a real estate listing of your house. If you ever did work on your house,

1358
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:51,495
Speaker 9:  if you're not planning something that's like a foundation bed around your

1359
01:28:51,495 --> 01:28:54,975
Speaker 9:  house, you could blue sky it. But we ended up coming with the

1360
01:28:54,975 --> 01:28:58,775
Speaker 9:  arbitrary rule that 10 pixels would equal one inch.

1361
01:28:59,205 --> 01:29:03,085
Speaker 9:  Most plant stuff in the United States seems to be in inches. So

1362
01:29:03,085 --> 01:29:06,245
Speaker 9:  this will have a 12 inch spread, this will have a 24 inch spread. If you

1363
01:29:06,245 --> 01:29:09,485
Speaker 9:  live in Europe, you would pick something different based on metric.

1364
01:29:10,025 --> 01:29:13,805
Speaker 9:  So the most pain in the ass part is taking a

1365
01:29:13,885 --> 01:29:17,725
Speaker 9:  PDF, which Figma does not recognize. You have to convert it to A PNG

1366
01:29:17,725 --> 01:29:21,445
Speaker 9:  or jpeg and then import it into Figma. Sure we did that in Photoshop.

1367
01:29:22,505 --> 01:29:26,165
Speaker 9:  You put it in and then you take something where you know the length is

1368
01:29:26,385 --> 01:29:29,085
Speaker 9:  and you set that to the scale you want. So if there's a wall of your house,

1369
01:29:29,225 --> 01:29:32,445
Speaker 9:  you could go measure it and say this wall is 14 feet wide,

1370
01:29:32,795 --> 01:29:36,725
Speaker 9:  therefore if my scale is 10 pixels

1371
01:29:37,025 --> 01:29:40,645
Speaker 9:  equals 12 inches, I know how

1372
01:29:41,035 --> 01:29:44,325
Speaker 9:  much that needs to be. I set that scale and then

1373
01:29:44,695 --> 01:29:48,605
Speaker 9:  everything from now on exists in that scale. One thing

1374
01:29:48,605 --> 01:29:52,245
Speaker 9:  that's nice about Figma is when you specify links, for example,

1375
01:29:52,425 --> 01:29:56,085
Speaker 9:  you can do math in the like field where you use a little

1376
01:29:56,285 --> 01:30:00,165
Speaker 9:  star thing to say like 10 times 12 and it'll

1377
01:30:00,165 --> 01:30:03,565
Speaker 9:  just do the math for you. So as you're converting into the pixel thing, you

1378
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:06,485
Speaker 9:  could actually do math directly there, but that's the hardest part of the

1379
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:10,245
Speaker 9:  whole system is importing the drawing of your house or your lot.

1380
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:14,005
Speaker 9:  You could use a Google Earth image of your lot as you're opening place.

1381
01:30:14,305 --> 01:30:18,165
Speaker 9:  People do all kinds of things but setting that scale is the hardest

1382
01:30:18,165 --> 01:30:21,765
Speaker 9:  part where you take one known measurement, you determine

1383
01:30:21,995 --> 01:30:25,365
Speaker 9:  what it should be in pixel land and then you have to do all of your planning

1384
01:30:25,365 --> 01:30:26,045
Speaker 9:  with that in mind.

1385
01:30:26,275 --> 01:30:29,405
Speaker 1:  Okay. But then at the end of it all, you have something like a rendering

1386
01:30:29,405 --> 01:30:33,205
Speaker 1:  of your whole space and then you can just start to populate it as you

1387
01:30:33,565 --> 01:30:33,645
Speaker 1:  like.

1388
01:30:34,075 --> 01:30:37,845
Speaker 9:  Yeah, exactly. Okay, so you get a background image then you're planning against

1389
01:30:37,845 --> 01:30:40,845
Speaker 9:  that and things when you, we'll talk about like when you get to planting

1390
01:30:40,845 --> 01:30:44,785
Speaker 9:  plants, but what you're generally thinking about is like how big is

1391
01:30:44,785 --> 01:30:47,865
Speaker 9:  this plant gonna spread therefore how do I space it when I'm planting?

1392
01:30:48,445 --> 01:30:51,905
Speaker 1:  Oh yeah. So okay, this is the thing about gardening. This is why I'm bad

1393
01:30:52,065 --> 01:30:55,665
Speaker 1:  at gardening because I just like, I'm looking outside, we have a a big

1394
01:30:56,095 --> 01:31:00,065
Speaker 1:  like raised planter out on our patio and it's like beautiful and made of

1395
01:31:00,065 --> 01:31:03,225
Speaker 1:  brick and we were like oh cool, we'll plant a bunch of stuff in there. We

1396
01:31:03,225 --> 01:31:05,745
Speaker 1:  planted it all as it turned out too close together and it all immediately

1397
01:31:05,745 --> 01:31:08,705
Speaker 1:  died. Super cool by us. Really happy about that.

1398
01:31:08,935 --> 01:31:12,505
Speaker 9:  Yeah. You know there's different philosophies of how to think about

1399
01:31:12,595 --> 01:31:15,985
Speaker 9:  plant spread. I generally plant things slightly tighter than

1400
01:31:16,415 --> 01:31:19,785
Speaker 9:  like the nursery will tell you because I don't like weeding and I don't like

1401
01:31:19,785 --> 01:31:23,625
Speaker 9:  looking at mulch. So there can be advantages

1402
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:27,425
Speaker 9:  to packing a little bit tighter. That being said, especially if it's perennial,

1403
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:30,825
Speaker 9:  it may get much, much bigger and you should think about the future.

1404
01:31:31,545 --> 01:31:35,025
Speaker 1:  Yes, that's a good rule of thumb. So tell me about the, the inserting of

1405
01:31:35,025 --> 01:31:38,865
Speaker 1:  plants I'm now obsessed with. Like you're not happy with the clip art plants,

1406
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:42,225
Speaker 1:  you want your own. Yes. Are you, are you going in and like

1407
01:31:42,815 --> 01:31:46,105
Speaker 1:  painstakingly drawing each plant that you might wanna, how do you do this?

1408
01:31:46,285 --> 01:31:50,265
Speaker 9:  So this is very easy. So I use the ellipsis tool and I draw circles

1409
01:31:50,525 --> 01:31:54,385
Speaker 9:  and I draw the circles to the width of a

1410
01:31:54,385 --> 01:31:58,345
Speaker 9:  mature plant. Okay. So if the plant is going to be 12 inches, I draw a

1411
01:31:58,485 --> 01:32:01,745
Speaker 9:  120 pixel circle very easy.

1412
01:32:02,685 --> 01:32:06,625
Speaker 9:  That's what it spread is going to be. Then if you're using

1413
01:32:07,135 --> 01:32:10,945
Speaker 9:  what I do, which is the browser version of Figma,

1414
01:32:10,945 --> 01:32:14,785
Speaker 9:  that's free, you can go and say okay, I wanna plant

1415
01:32:15,845 --> 01:32:19,745
Speaker 9:  RIS blazing star, nice native plant. I can just go to Google photos,

1416
01:32:20,295 --> 01:32:24,025
Speaker 9:  copy a photo there, open Figma up, click the ellipsis

1417
01:32:24,315 --> 01:32:28,185
Speaker 9:  paste and it will fill that little circle with an image of that

1418
01:32:28,185 --> 01:32:31,425
Speaker 9:  plant. So if I care about textures and I care about colors,

1419
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:35,605
Speaker 9:  I'm gonna have that image there and then I have a little

1420
01:32:35,845 --> 01:32:39,835
Speaker 9:  plant. Now to be practical, what I don't

1421
01:32:39,835 --> 01:32:43,755
Speaker 9:  wanna have to do is like go copy and paste that a bunch of times maybe I

1422
01:32:43,755 --> 01:32:47,635
Speaker 9:  find out I wanna plant a different variety of lely actress and it has a

1423
01:32:47,635 --> 01:32:51,035
Speaker 9:  different spread. So you can do something where you right click the ellipsis

1424
01:32:51,055 --> 01:32:54,915
Speaker 9:  and you set it up as a component. So there is like, oh okay,

1425
01:32:55,235 --> 01:32:58,635
Speaker 9:  a parent object and I place all of my parent

1426
01:32:58,745 --> 01:33:02,475
Speaker 9:  objects in like a corner of my canvas that's like my

1427
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:06,505
Speaker 9:  key and I name what it is. So I have the thing,

1428
01:33:07,065 --> 01:33:10,105
Speaker 9:  I have a little circle that has a picture of what the foliage looks like.

1429
01:33:10,525 --> 01:33:14,465
Speaker 9:  It has the name of the plant and it's set to the right mature diameter in

1430
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:18,425
Speaker 9:  a little like component library key. And then I can just copy paste it

1431
01:33:18,425 --> 01:33:21,075
Speaker 9:  in as I'm actually laying out plants.

1432
01:33:21,995 --> 01:33:25,755
Speaker 1:  I feel like you're describing something that is like sneakily a perfect use

1433
01:33:25,755 --> 01:33:29,355
Speaker 1:  for generative AI where I just wanna like you're, you're like just describe

1434
01:33:29,495 --> 01:33:32,155
Speaker 1:  the plant that you think it's going to be and just let it appear there and

1435
01:33:32,315 --> 01:33:34,275
Speaker 1:  I'm like this is what all the image systems should be doing.

1436
01:33:34,795 --> 01:33:37,915
Speaker 9:  Yeah. You know there's, well I'll say there's like limitations to this and

1437
01:33:37,915 --> 01:33:41,195
Speaker 9:  maybe this is where AI can come in is like what I'm talking about is doing

1438
01:33:41,315 --> 01:33:45,195
Speaker 9:  a two dimensional planting plan. Fair. Another thing you have to

1439
01:33:45,195 --> 01:33:48,635
Speaker 9:  worry about when you're gardening is the height of your plant. This is not

1440
01:33:48,635 --> 01:33:51,875
Speaker 9:  going to do height for you so you're gonna have to

1441
01:33:52,455 --> 01:33:55,715
Speaker 9:  pay attention or have enough knowledge of how tall things grow.

1442
01:33:57,015 --> 01:34:00,435
Speaker 9:  You're also not going to get seasonality out of this. So

1443
01:34:01,215 --> 01:34:05,035
Speaker 9:  things bloom at different times of the year. So If you were

1444
01:34:05,035 --> 01:34:08,995
Speaker 9:  really psychotic, what you could do is take your garden plan

1445
01:34:09,145 --> 01:34:13,075
Speaker 9:  once you've built it in Figma, choose all of the photos that you've

1446
01:34:13,075 --> 01:34:16,915
Speaker 9:  used for your plants of like springtime that make a total duplicate

1447
01:34:16,915 --> 01:34:20,395
Speaker 9:  of this and replace all the photos with what they look like in June

1448
01:34:21,135 --> 01:34:24,315
Speaker 9:  and then again in like September. But that would be

1449
01:34:24,775 --> 01:34:27,955
Speaker 9:  really crazy and I would say again this is not perfect,

1450
01:34:28,735 --> 01:34:32,675
Speaker 9:  we are just aiming for good enough for an amateur gardener. Okay.

1451
01:34:32,955 --> 01:34:36,755
Speaker 1:  I do feel like 2026 Helen is gonna come on and tell me about like

1452
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:40,675
Speaker 1:  how you bought a vision pro to do this. So now you can see it all spatially

1453
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:43,035
Speaker 1:  and actually map it in real time as you're walking through the garden and

1454
01:34:43,035 --> 01:34:45,715
Speaker 1:  like I feel like that's where we're headed and that is the best possible

1455
01:34:45,715 --> 01:34:46,315
Speaker 1:  outcome here.

1456
01:34:46,775 --> 01:34:50,715
Speaker 9:  No, I mean what this, yes David, that could be the beautiful future and

1457
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:54,915
Speaker 9:  I'm sure there's actually a bunch of cool startup garden design apps.

1458
01:34:55,045 --> 01:34:59,015
Speaker 9:  Maybe. Probably are. How big is your market size of amateur gardeners

1459
01:34:59,015 --> 01:35:02,855
Speaker 9:  with lots of enthusiasm trapped in winter, only

1460
01:35:02,855 --> 01:35:04,815
Speaker 9:  using your software for two months of the year.

1461
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:10,895
Speaker 9:  But no, I mean the, the end output you get here is you get an

1462
01:35:10,895 --> 01:35:13,895
Speaker 9:  image of your house or your garden bed, which is your background canvas.

1463
01:35:14,195 --> 01:35:18,175
Speaker 9:  You get a little key of all the plants in one place. That's where

1464
01:35:18,175 --> 01:35:21,535
Speaker 9:  you've arranged all of your components and then in your little gardening

1465
01:35:21,565 --> 01:35:25,455
Speaker 9:  beds that you've drawn it, you can see how you plan to space this out,

1466
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:29,815
Speaker 9:  how you think layering and interspersing plants should work. And then you

1467
01:35:29,815 --> 01:35:33,295
Speaker 9:  can go count how many of these did it take for me to fill this bed? This

1468
01:35:33,295 --> 01:35:37,095
Speaker 9:  is how many I need to buy before I go put my garden

1469
01:35:37,155 --> 01:35:40,775
Speaker 9:  in. So it gets you, again not a

1470
01:35:40,775 --> 01:35:44,615
Speaker 9:  professional garden plan, but it gets you like good enough for an

1471
01:35:44,615 --> 01:35:46,775
Speaker 9:  average person who can use basic software.

1472
01:35:47,015 --> 01:35:50,095
Speaker 1:  I love this. What's the big garden upgrade for 2025? What are you working

1473
01:35:50,095 --> 01:35:50,495
Speaker 1:  on right now?

1474
01:35:51,115 --> 01:35:55,055
Speaker 9:  Ooh, we planted a bunch of native plants actually in the fall this

1475
01:35:55,055 --> 01:35:58,055
Speaker 9:  year, which turned out to be terrible timing because it was a big drought.

1476
01:35:59,075 --> 01:36:02,775
Speaker 9:  So please root for me. So this year is gonna be

1477
01:36:02,885 --> 01:36:06,455
Speaker 9:  more about observing how all of the stuff we've already planted now

1478
01:36:06,585 --> 01:36:10,535
Speaker 9:  comes up, how it looks. I'm big into like converting

1479
01:36:10,865 --> 01:36:11,775
Speaker 9:  grass to meadow

1480
01:36:13,485 --> 01:36:16,735
Speaker 9:  that I would say I'm not planning a Figma meadow is just chaos.

1481
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:21,175
Speaker 9:  It is a battle, a constant battle with invasives.

1482
01:36:21,835 --> 01:36:25,255
Speaker 9:  Native plant meadows are more of a battleground. They're not a planned ecosystem.

1483
01:36:25,875 --> 01:36:26,895
Speaker 1:  AI can't solve that yet.

1484
01:36:27,795 --> 01:36:31,215
Speaker 9:  AI can't solve that. Phil does constantly pitch

1485
01:36:32,735 --> 01:36:36,695
Speaker 9:  robotics for invasives removal and also dealing

1486
01:36:36,695 --> 01:36:40,415
Speaker 9:  with some of the problems we now have of invasive pests. So

1487
01:36:40,445 --> 01:36:44,215
Speaker 9:  there's something called the jumping worm, which is exactly what you think

1488
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:48,175
Speaker 9:  it is. It's a worm that jumps. Oh dear. Which is one really gross.

1489
01:36:48,285 --> 01:36:52,135
Speaker 9:  It's not fun to have in your land if you're gardening, but also they

1490
01:36:52,135 --> 01:36:55,895
Speaker 9:  really deplete the nutrients from the soil. It's pretty bad and they're

1491
01:36:55,895 --> 01:36:59,495
Speaker 9:  spreading and no one knows what to do about it. And this maybe is like an

1492
01:36:59,495 --> 01:37:02,455
Speaker 9:  ideal application for robotics

1493
01:37:03,475 --> 01:37:07,375
Speaker 9:  who have enough AI that they could identify and zap jumping

1494
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:11,415
Speaker 9:  worms. Now how you do that without like starting a fire or

1495
01:37:11,775 --> 01:37:15,695
Speaker 9:  accidentally zapping other worms? Big question.

1496
01:37:16,535 --> 01:37:19,675
Speaker 9:  And then you can really get into like deep in the like

1497
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:24,395
Speaker 9:  what invasives are bad, what invasives are good. No,

1498
01:37:24,395 --> 01:37:27,915
Speaker 9:  earthworm is native to the United States, for example, but they're fine.

1499
01:37:27,915 --> 01:37:28,915
Speaker 9:  They're good with

1500
01:37:29,115 --> 01:37:32,555
Speaker 1:  'em exist. Yeah. I do feel like you, you've just inadvertently started an

1501
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:35,355
Speaker 1:  annual tradition, which is that you and I are gonna come on here once a year

1502
01:37:35,355 --> 01:37:38,955
Speaker 1:  and we're going to review the whole sweep of technology based on how capably

1503
01:37:39,535 --> 01:37:42,955
Speaker 1:  robots can solve your garden for you. 'cause that's, that's where we're headed.

1504
01:37:43,385 --> 01:37:47,255
Speaker 1:  It's like everybody wants the robot gardens to be possible. Yeah. Nature

1505
01:37:47,315 --> 01:37:50,055
Speaker 1:  is complicated. This, this is, this is the future. It

1506
01:37:50,055 --> 01:37:53,815
Speaker 9:  Seems like robot lawn mowers are getting generally better.

1507
01:37:53,965 --> 01:37:57,885
Speaker 9:  I've seen them at some botanical gardens. We're very curious about

1508
01:37:57,885 --> 01:38:01,725
Speaker 9:  lawn RBAs. I hear Jen's working on something though, so hold, hold off and

1509
01:38:01,725 --> 01:38:04,805
Speaker 9:  see if Jen tells you whether to buy it or not. There's a lot at C. Yes, I'm

1510
01:38:04,965 --> 01:38:05,085
Speaker 9:  skeptical.

1511
01:38:05,135 --> 01:38:07,685
Speaker 1:  There will be a lot. I will say I've only heard a little bit about what Jen's

1512
01:38:07,685 --> 01:38:09,445
Speaker 1:  working on when she's finished. She's gonna come on and we have a whole thing

1513
01:38:09,445 --> 01:38:13,205
Speaker 1:  planned, but I don't necessarily think it's going super well. So

1514
01:38:13,525 --> 01:38:17,165
Speaker 1:  everybody pray for Jen on that front. All right Helen,

1515
01:38:17,615 --> 01:38:20,525
Speaker 1:  we're gonna get some emails so I'm gonna pass 'em on. If you have tips for

1516
01:38:20,535 --> 01:38:24,285
Speaker 1:  Helen on her garden planning software, vergecast at VERGE dot com,

1517
01:38:24,285 --> 01:38:27,205
Speaker 1:  we'll pass them all along and we will do this again next winter.

1518
01:38:27,715 --> 01:38:30,685
Speaker 9:  I'll try and finally publish a how to in January.

1519
01:38:31,115 --> 01:38:34,485
Speaker 1:  Love it. Everyone needs this. It's, this is, I'm gonna get back into it for

1520
01:38:34,485 --> 01:38:36,485
Speaker 1:  two weeks like I do every year and it's gonna be incredible.

1521
01:38:36,795 --> 01:38:40,765
Speaker 9:  It's very niche. There's like three people like myself who

1522
01:38:40,765 --> 01:38:41,405
Speaker 9:  really need this.

1523
01:38:41,705 --> 01:38:45,645
Speaker 1:  Oh, I don't know. Again, the response to the off-handed thing you said last

1524
01:38:45,645 --> 01:38:48,685
Speaker 1:  week would, would speak differently, but, but we'll see. All right Helen,

1525
01:38:48,685 --> 01:38:50,125
Speaker 1:  thank you as always. Thanks

1526
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:51,845
Speaker 9:  David. Have a good one.

1527
01:38:54,115 --> 01:38:57,405
Speaker 1:  Alright, that's it for the first cast today. Thank you to everyone who came

1528
01:38:57,405 --> 01:39:00,885
Speaker 1:  on the show and thank you as always for listening. There's lots more on Everything

1529
01:39:00,885 --> 01:39:04,445
Speaker 1:  we talked about, including the information about the CES Vergecast

1530
01:39:04,515 --> 01:39:07,885
Speaker 1:  Wednesday, January 8th, links in the show notes. I'll put all the links to

1531
01:39:07,885 --> 01:39:11,405
Speaker 1:  everything in the show notes, all of our Google coverage. If Helen will let

1532
01:39:11,405 --> 01:39:14,645
Speaker 1:  me share her Figma, I'll put it in there too, but you never know. We'll see.

1533
01:39:15,025 --> 01:39:18,485
Speaker 1:  And as always, read the website, keep your feedback coming. We love hearing

1534
01:39:18,485 --> 01:39:21,685
Speaker 1:  from all of you. Call the hotline. Eight six six VERGE one, one. Email us

1535
01:39:21,885 --> 01:39:25,005
Speaker 1:  vergecast at The Verge dot com. We have one more episode to come for this

1536
01:39:25,005 --> 01:39:28,445
Speaker 1:  year, and then we're taking a little break before CES, but we are not done

1537
01:39:28,465 --> 01:39:32,325
Speaker 1:  yet with 2024. This show is produced by Liam James, Wil Poor and

1538
01:39:32,325 --> 01:39:35,565
Speaker 1:  Eric Gomez. Vergecast is VERGE Production and part of the Vox Media podcast

1539
01:39:35,565 --> 01:39:39,365
Speaker 1:  network. Neli, and I'll be back on Friday with a

1540
01:39:39,385 --> 01:39:42,085
Speaker 1:  bit of a surprise. But if you've been listening for a while, I suspect you

1541
01:39:42,085 --> 01:39:44,365
Speaker 1:  know exactly what it's, we'll see you then. I rock and roll

1542
01:39:53,985 --> 01:39:57,075
Speaker 5:  That. That would be a delightful punk album.

1543
01:39:57,325 --> 01:39:58,275
Speaker 5:  Multimodal agents.

1544
01:39:58,275 --> 01:39:59,955
Speaker 1:  Multimodal Agents is, that's pretty good.

1545
01:40:39,975 --> 01:40:43,675
Speaker 2:  Hey, it's Liam from Decoder with Neli Patel. We spent a lot of time talking

1546
01:40:43,675 --> 01:40:47,115
Speaker 2:  about some of the most important people in tech and business about what they're

1547
01:40:47,115 --> 01:40:50,315
Speaker 2:  putting resources to and why they think it's so critical for the future.

1548
01:40:50,695 --> 01:40:54,005
Speaker 2:  That's why we're doing this special series. Diving into some of the most

1549
01:40:54,005 --> 01:40:57,965
Speaker 2:  unique ways companies are spending money today, for instance, what

1550
01:40:57,965 --> 01:41:01,605
Speaker 2:  does it mean to start buying and using AI at work? How much is that

1551
01:41:01,635 --> 01:41:05,525
Speaker 2:  costing companies? What products are they buying and most importantly, what

1552
01:41:05,525 --> 01:41:09,125
Speaker 2:  are they doing with it? And of course, podcasts. Yes. The thing you're listening

1553
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:13,005
Speaker 2:  to right now, well, it's increasingly being produced directly by

1554
01:41:13,285 --> 01:41:16,805
Speaker 2:  companies like venture capital firms, investment funds, and a new crop of

1555
01:41:17,045 --> 01:41:20,805
Speaker 2:  creators who one day want to be investors themselves. And what is actually

1556
01:41:20,855 --> 01:41:24,565
Speaker 2:  going on with these acquisitions this year, especially in the AI space.

1557
01:41:24,825 --> 01:41:28,685
Speaker 2:  Why are so many big players in tech deciding not to acquire and

1558
01:41:28,685 --> 01:41:32,605
Speaker 2:  instead licensed tech and hire away co-founders? The answer it turns

1559
01:41:32,625 --> 01:41:36,525
Speaker 2:  out is a lot more complicated than it seems. You'll hear all that and

1560
01:41:36,525 --> 01:41:40,165
Speaker 2:  more this month on decoder with Eli Patel presented by Stripe.

1561
01:41:40,305 --> 01:41:42,405
Speaker 2:  You can listen to decoder wherever you get your podcasts.
