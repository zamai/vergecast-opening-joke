00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,140
Speaker 3:  Welcome. To. The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of interoperable messaging

3
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,900
Speaker 3:  protocols. I'm your friend David Pierce, and this is the second episode in

4
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,820
Speaker 3:  our miniseries all about connectivity. Last week we talked to tele c

5
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,780
Speaker 3:  e o, Ilia Posen about how we interact with our TVs, the biggest

6
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,660
Speaker 3:  screens in our house, and how we connect to the content that we care about.

7
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,460
Speaker 3:  This week we're gonna talk about people. I think the best way I can explain

8
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,780
Speaker 3:  the conversation we're about to have is to tell you a story about my wife.

9
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,900
Speaker 3:  This happened just the other day. I swear this is true. It was the most perfect

10
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,100
Speaker 3:  timing. So I'm in the living room, sitting on the couch watching tv, and

11
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,860
Speaker 3:  my wife Anna comes in and is like, I hate so much when somebody

12
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,660
Speaker 3:  makes you download a whole new app. Just to group chat. Turns out she

13
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,100
Speaker 3:  joined this mom's group and the person organizing everything made her download

14
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,500
Speaker 3:  GroupMe, which you might remember as the messaging app Microsoft bought a

15
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,340
Speaker 3:  bunch of years ago and then like forgot about, she had never heard of GroupMe,

16
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,780
Speaker 3:  didn't want to use GroupMe, and now she had to have it on her phone just

17
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,660
Speaker 3:  for this one group chat. She was standing there like, why can't

18
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,340
Speaker 3:  messaging apps just work together? So I can talk to everyone in one place.

19
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,980
Speaker 3:  And, what I said to her is, listen to The Vergecast, because that right

20
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,860
Speaker 3:  there is what today's episode is all about. How did we get to the point

21
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,740
Speaker 3:  where talking to my friends requires a half dozen apps and I have to check

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,820
Speaker 3:  10 inboxes every day and I have to have this mental map of

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,500
Speaker 3:  who I talk to in WhatsApp and who I talk to in iMessage and who I talk to

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,220
Speaker 3:  in Instagram dms and on and on and on. It's awful.

25
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,940
Speaker 3:  And before you messaged me saying, David, this is because America is dumb.

26
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,140
Speaker 3:  Everyone else in the world is just on WhatsApp. Two things, one I

27
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,940
Speaker 3:  know and I'm deeply jealous. And two, I don't think

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,660
Speaker 3:  that's actually a good answer either. We shouldn't all be on one

29
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,940
Speaker 3:  platform. There are lots of these platforms and systems out there. Shouldn't

30
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,860
Speaker 3:  they all work together like the web or like email? I kind of think it

31
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,340
Speaker 3:  should, and the person I'm talking with today absolutely thinks it should.

32
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,220
Speaker 4:  My full name is Eric. Migicovsky

33
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,540
Speaker 3:  Eric is the co-founder and c e o of Beeper, a new-ish universal

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,260
Speaker 3:  messaging app. Beeper's big idea is to take all your messages from

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,220
Speaker 3:  all of your apps, Twitter, LinkedIn, iMessage, slack, a bunch of

36
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,100
Speaker 3:  other places, and put them all in one place. I've been a Beeper user for

37
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,480
Speaker 3:  a couple of years now and the app is definitely still new and definitely

38
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,760
Speaker 3:  kind of hacky, but this also feels like the way things

39
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,800
Speaker 3:  obviously should work. One place for all your communications

40
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,920
Speaker 3:  that just makes sense. So why doesn't it work like that and can we get

41
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,800
Speaker 3:  this sprawling, messy chat ecosystem back to a place that

42
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,280
Speaker 3:  makes sense? That's kind of my big question going into this.

43
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,600
Speaker 3:  The first thing you need to know about Eric is that before he started Beeper,

44
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,240
Speaker 3:  he was the founder of Pebble, one of the early smartwatch companies and one

45
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,200
Speaker 3:  of the more interesting and beloved hardware startups, I think ever So I

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,400
Speaker 3:  figured You know you're making a smart watch, you're thinking about chat

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,120
Speaker 3:  and notifications, so suddenly messaging gets stuck in your brain. That's

48
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,840
Speaker 3:  where I assumed this story started, but Eric said no, it actually goes

49
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,320
Speaker 3:  back much, much farther than that.

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,880
Speaker 4:  I think that because of my era, like when I started to use

51
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,680
Speaker 4:  chat and when I started to use the internet, I associated a lot of my

52
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,840
Speaker 4:  experiences of You know being online, finding

53
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,680
Speaker 4:  groups of friends, hanging out with my friends. Like we just, we hung out

54
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,560
Speaker 4:  on M S N after school, you'd You know Fire up the modem

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,720
Speaker 4:  or D S L or whatever you had and you'd hang out and you'd do homework and

56
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,480
Speaker 4:  you'd wait for, well, actually it probably even goes back to I C Q

57
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,520
Speaker 4:  that that uhoh, remember that sound? Uhoh?

58
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,000
Speaker 3:  Of course it

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,080
Speaker 4:  Was addictive because it, it was a reminder that there was someone who was

60
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,600
Speaker 4:  You know pinging you and wanted to chat. Got to the point where my dad could

61
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,720
Speaker 4:  actually emulate the Uhoh sound and cause me to drop whatever

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,200
Speaker 4:  I was doing in the house and just like run, run back to my computer because

63
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,960
Speaker 4:  I needed to get there before he or anyone else in the family did. Because

64
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,560
Speaker 4:  You know shared computers.

65
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,160
Speaker 3:  Yep. That was back in the days of the computer room.

66
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And so my experience with chat is kind of

67
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,000
Speaker 4:  foundational to computing. Like every device that I pick up,

68
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,240
Speaker 4:  I use it to chat with friends and I have, I think like

69
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,200
Speaker 4:  I've benchmarked myself against other folks and, and I can kind of see how

70
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,120
Speaker 4:  my chat patterns. Like I, I spend a lot of the day chatting. I have, I, I

71
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,680
Speaker 4:  grew up in Canada, I've lived in Europe, I've lived in Asia, I now live in

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,640
Speaker 4:  California. I have collected friends and family members

73
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,280
Speaker 4:  on every single chat app in existence. And for

74
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,360
Speaker 4:  some crazy reason, each place around the world kind of

75
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,200
Speaker 4:  has a different chat app as their primary means of communication. So I've

76
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,120
Speaker 4:  collected friends, You know two or three people on every single app.

77
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,840
Speaker 4:  And yeah, this is obviously all leading towards starting Beeper, but in the

78
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,240
Speaker 4:  last You know, 10 years, there really hasn't been

79
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,320
Speaker 4:  a single app that you can use to chat with all of your friends.

80
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,840
Speaker 4:  We were forced to download five to 10 different apps.

81
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,960
Speaker 4:  Even if you just wanted to, to message like one person and every computer

82
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,760
Speaker 4:  you'd have, you'd have to install all these, all these apps and it just

83
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,960
Speaker 4:  got to be more annoying. Like it felt like communication, like we live in

84
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,680
Speaker 4:  the future. You know, I just tried out chat G B T for the image

85
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,600
Speaker 4:  recognition one. It's, it's crazy. It's wild. Yeah. Like we literally are

86
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,160
Speaker 4:  living in the future, but for some reason the experience of

87
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,880
Speaker 4:  chatting is still stuck in like 15 years ago.

88
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,000
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Why do you think that is? Actually, I've, I've spent some time looking

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,880
Speaker 3:  into this and I, I've heard a lot of people blame a lot of things. Like

90
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,480
Speaker 3:  we had that era of Adio and Trillian and this idea of

91
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,760
Speaker 3:  messaging that worked kind of like email, right? Where you could have an

92
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,440
Speaker 3:  account on a bunch of different platforms, but all these platforms more or

93
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,360
Speaker 3:  less could talk to each other. It wasn't always perfect, but it kind of

94
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,880
Speaker 3:  worked and you could at least have an app that had all the platforms in one

95
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,160
Speaker 3:  place, even if they weren't talking to each other, you could at least have

96
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,640
Speaker 3:  them all in one place. And then that broke. And I've talked to people who

97
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,560
Speaker 3:  blame Facebook, I've talked to people who blame Google. I've talked to people

98
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,480
Speaker 3:  who say, well, it was just never gonna work that way forever. What's your

99
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,160
Speaker 3:  sense of what led us down kind of that wrong

100
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,960
Speaker 3:  siloed path we've been on for the last decade?

101
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,280
Speaker 4:  I think there's a couple things at play here. One is the shift to

102
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,520
Speaker 4:  mobile. 2007, the iPhone came out and that changed everything.

103
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,880
Speaker 4:  Everything that had existed on the internet before was based

104
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,360
Speaker 4:  on long running socket connections to a central server

105
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,560
Speaker 4:  or You know, a P two P style Torrent You know

106
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,040
Speaker 4:  distributed mesh network. But both of those models

107
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,160
Speaker 4:  required kind of cheap access to the internet

108
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,240
Speaker 3:  In a way that they were perfectly suited to the like always on computer room,

109
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,680
Speaker 3:  right? Like that was yes, that it was exactly right for that device that

110
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,760
Speaker 3:  just sits there in the background kind of on all the time. I had never thought

111
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,240
Speaker 3:  of it like that.

112
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,800
Speaker 4:  I R C doesn't actually have, like when you log into an I R

113
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,720
Speaker 4:  C server, you don't get any history. You have to have your I R C

114
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,440
Speaker 4:  client running 24 7 in order to be able to see what was

115
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,120
Speaker 4:  happening in the scroll back. So that's just like an indicator of how

116
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,520
Speaker 4:  little the world was set up for, or the, the kind of internet as a whole

117
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,240
Speaker 4:  was set up for this big shift to mobile. And so with the shift to mobile,

118
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,440
Speaker 4:  all the existing chat apps died. They weren't ready for it. And new apps

119
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,920
Speaker 4:  sprung up to fill the void. WhatsApp, iMessage,

120
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,880
Speaker 4:  telegram, Snapchat, they were all built mobile

121
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,840
Speaker 4:  first. They had many new features like end-to-end encryption

122
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,720
Speaker 4:  because you had this device that was, you You know you have your phone and

123
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,520
Speaker 4:  it's always with you and, and you only have one phone at a time. These new

124
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,280
Speaker 4:  apps or these new systems could afford to have a closer connection to

125
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,200
Speaker 4:  your personal identity, which allows for things like You know, You know you

126
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,560
Speaker 4:  have a pretty good idea of who you're gonna message when you message their

127
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,280
Speaker 4:  phone number end an encryption. You know didn't exist before there was You

128
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,080
Speaker 4:  know a little bit of Jabber end an encryption, but no one really implemented

129
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,920
Speaker 4:  that. So it was a big new innovation that came along with the switch to mobile

130
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,680
Speaker 4:  and everyone got a phone that allowed so many more

131
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,880
Speaker 4:  people to start chatting. And so while we remembered the, the golden age

132
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,320
Speaker 4:  of Chat being You know, logging into Adio on our Dell

133
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,080
Speaker 4:  desktop or whatever, most people's first experience with chat is

134
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,600
Speaker 4:  SS m s, WhatsApp, iMessage, discord, You know

135
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,920
Speaker 4:  Snapchat. Yeah, Instagram, You know all those apps and and

136
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,760
Speaker 4:  networks were not built with Federation or decentralization in

137
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,560
Speaker 4:  mind. They were built as, they should have been just individual

138
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,840
Speaker 4:  apps that served a great purpose, that delivered an excellent experience

139
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,880
Speaker 4:  to people and they just didn't really care about the past. And

140
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,560
Speaker 4:  that was fine. I don't think that anyone should be blamed for that. Like

141
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,680
Speaker 4:  we want to have new products, we want to have the evolution of You know technology.

142
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,360
Speaker 4:  We don't want things to be stuck stagnant. Sure.

143
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,240
Speaker 3:  But at the same time, Google didn't wall off Gmail from the rest

144
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,240
Speaker 3:  of the email universe just because it switched to how

145
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,120
Speaker 3:  mobile works. And I get, I think what what you're describing is a much bigger

146
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,720
Speaker 3:  technical change, which makes sense and and there's a moment where it's like,

147
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,120
Speaker 3:  okay, we have to rebuild this anyway. We're gonna rebuild it differently.

148
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,800
Speaker 3:  But part of me still wonders if, if there wasn't room back then

149
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,600
Speaker 3:  to do it better and a bunch of companies who had business reasons not to,

150
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,160
Speaker 3:  just didn't.

151
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,280
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I mean I would actually take Google aside and say that

152
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,320
Speaker 4:  everyone else is net neutral if You know they're not maliciously trying

153
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,280
Speaker 4:  to make life worse for people, but Google actually goes an extra

154
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,720
Speaker 4:  step to say, I want to, even though it's harder to make something with an

155
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,680
Speaker 4:  A P I or even though it's harder to make something that's federated and decentralized,

156
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
Speaker 4:  I think Google goes a step in that direction to say, look, let's at least

157
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,640
Speaker 4:  try. And I think that just goes to the core of You know Google's

158
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,920
Speaker 4:  hacker You know sensibilities. Yeah. But no one else seems to have that.

159
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,880
Speaker 4:  So that's, but if you look at the major players like Facebook and

160
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,680
Speaker 4:  Apple and even s m s to a certain degree, no,

161
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,640
Speaker 4:  there's no ability for other apps to interact with those or

162
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,080
Speaker 4:  those systems easily.

163
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,280
Speaker 3:  I mean for so many years Facebook's own apps didn't interact with each other.

164
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,240
Speaker 3:  Like it was just, it was not even a thing anybody thought about for so, so,

165
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,080
Speaker 3:  so long. Yeah.

166
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,440
Speaker 4:  Now that you, now that we're talking about it, like technically Facebook

167
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,280
Speaker 4:  Messenger did actually support Jabber back in the day. And so you could message

168
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,240
Speaker 4:  someone on Google talk from Facebook Messenger and I think like

169
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,800
Speaker 4:  there probably was some moment where

170
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,600
Speaker 4:  you'll have to research the history, but I think either Google shut down

171
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,400
Speaker 4:  their Jabber Bridge or Facebook shut down the Jabber Bridge and then

172
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,080
Speaker 4:  everyone kind of sharped down at the same point.

173
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,840
Speaker 3:  Because that was also the time when everybody realized how valuable

174
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,960
Speaker 3:  these networks are And what you can do if you have people in your space.

175
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,000
Speaker 3:  And it feels like, like the other thing that happened in that time was everybody

176
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,000
Speaker 3:  in every industry said, we have to build universes inside of our apps.

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,920
Speaker 3:  Right? Like, that's what Netflix did. It's, it's not that different a behavior

178
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,760
Speaker 3:  in a lot of ways.

179
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,040
Speaker 4:  But what's interesting about that is I think that's the prevailing wisdom.

180
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,120
Speaker 4:  That's what we all assume. But if you look at the actual businesses

181
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,680
Speaker 4:  that have been built on top of chat or adjacent to chat,

182
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,200
Speaker 4:  chat does not make any of these big companies money, right? They're not even,

183
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,320
Speaker 4:  it's close to making the money. Take WhatsApp for example. WhatsApp

184
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,240
Speaker 4:  was acquired in 2013 ish and it was the

185
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,120
Speaker 4:  biggest acquisition ever. And there was You know noise about

186
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,160
Speaker 4:  who's gonna get WhatsApp? Is it gonna be Google or Facebook? And Facebook

187
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,040
Speaker 4:  paid this outrageous sum because they didn't want it to go to Google and

188
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,280
Speaker 4:  enrich Google's Google Plus or whatever they were doing at the time.

189
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,120
Speaker 4:  And you'd, you'd imagine like, I think it was probably hundreds of millions

190
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,560
Speaker 4:  if not a billion users already when they acquired them. And

191
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,280
Speaker 4:  you'd be like, great, okay. Like how are we gonna make money off this?

192
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,640
Speaker 4:  And we are 10 years later and I don't think WhatsApp

193
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,000
Speaker 4:  is making significant money for Facebook at all.

194
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,880
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I don't, I I I think that's true. And I think one of the things a lot

195
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,320
Speaker 3:  of these services have discovered over the last few years is there's no money

196
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,440
Speaker 3:  in messaging. And if you try to stick

197
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,680
Speaker 3:  money making things into messaging, people will revolt. Like I think

198
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,640
Speaker 3:  back to Google Aloe where they were like, we're gonna bring in

199
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,600
Speaker 3:  an AI assistant that's gonna help you buy tickets when we understand that

200
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
Speaker 3:  you're talking about tickets, isn't that useful? And everybody went, no,

201
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,120
Speaker 3:  that's horrible. Just let me talk to my friends.

202
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,880
Speaker 4:  What I find is remarkable about this as someone who's building a chat app

203
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,960
Speaker 4:  where You know our plan is to actually just charge charge people money chat

204
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,880
Speaker 4:  is so fundamental to what we do. We do it dozens if not

205
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,920
Speaker 4:  hundreds of times per day. You know if you look at your screen time across

206
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,440
Speaker 4:  all your devices, it probably doesn't, maybe it adds up to like an hour or

207
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,800
Speaker 4:  two, but it, the, the number of interactions that you spend in chat across

208
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,600
Speaker 4:  all the different chat platforms that you have is mind-boggling. You know

209
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,360
Speaker 4:  that is the way that we as humans communicate. Like it's no longer

210
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,440
Speaker 4:  phone calls, it's no longer email. The future is chat. Like

211
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,080
Speaker 4:  that is how we communicate and as

212
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,120
Speaker 4:  a product, it has been kind of left by the wayside because

213
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,080
Speaker 4:  of this unclear definition around the business model. So what I

214
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,480
Speaker 4:  mean by that is iMessage started in 2011, I think

215
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,680
Speaker 4:  WhatsApp just a few years before that. If you look at roughly how these apps

216
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,600
Speaker 4:  work, You know there's an inbox and there's a conversation view, a

217
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,560
Speaker 4:  chat view. They haven't changed in the last 10, 15 years. Yep. It's

218
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,520
Speaker 4:  the same view, it's the same functionality. There's been a few other message

219
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,480
Speaker 4:  types. You can now send emo emoji reactions. You know we're literally

220
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,800
Speaker 4:  just added to WhatsApp a year, a year, like a year ago. They're

221
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,680
Speaker 3:  Great, by the way. I don't mean to denigrate emoji reactions. It's like I'm,

222
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,320
Speaker 3:  I'm, no, it's a big fan of emoji reactions.

223
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,720
Speaker 4:  It's good. But it's like, I think that just to illustrate how slowly

224
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,320
Speaker 4:  these things are moving and You know part of that symptom of getting

225
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,040
Speaker 4:  to scale, like once you have 3 billion users, it's harder to steer sort of

226
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,480
Speaker 4:  the steer the ship in different directions. But what I think is missing

227
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,280
Speaker 4:  is an opportunity for other people to build on top of these

228
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,760
Speaker 4:  communication protocols and expand what

229
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,600
Speaker 4:  we can do with chat You know in an instant

230
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Speaker 4:  messaging. Just look at email You know as a counter example.

231
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,240
Speaker 4:  When you have an open standard for communication or for

232
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,080
Speaker 4:  for email or you have Gmail, which goes outta their way again to, to

233
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,800
Speaker 4:  allow other kind of people to build on top of it, whether it's plugins or

234
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,680
Speaker 4:  alternative clients or just the a p i, you get

235
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,360
Speaker 4:  an evolution, a very clear timeline over the last 15 years

236
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,120
Speaker 4:  of new productivity software, of new

237
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,360
Speaker 4:  casual, fun, You know entertainment. You get kind of

238
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,960
Speaker 4:  this work operating system that people now use through Google

239
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,880
Speaker 4:  Workspace and, and all the apps that you can associate with your You know

240
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,760
Speaker 4:  Google account. That Cambrian explosion of tools

241
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,560
Speaker 4:  built on top of Gmail is just completely and utterly missing

242
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,560
Speaker 4:  from chat because of the fact that there is no a p i for

243
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,400
Speaker 4:  iMessage or WhatsApp or even S m Ss to a certain degree. You know

244
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,120
Speaker 4:  actually, I guess SMS and Twilio is a, is a, is a kind of good counter example

245
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,000
Speaker 4:  of what happens when there is at least one kind of side door that you

246
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,560
Speaker 4:  could get into and build on top of. But in the case of iMessage and and WhatsApp,

247
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,920
Speaker 4:  like there's basically nothing you can't build on top of those systems.

248
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,280
Speaker 3:  All, right? We gotta take a break and then we'll be back with more from Eric

249
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,740
Speaker 3:  Welcome back like Eric was just talking about. Part of the challenge with

250
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,620
Speaker 3:  messaging has been that there's just no way to build on top of

251
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,580
Speaker 3:  these systems. They're often not great products, honestly, and there's

252
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,220
Speaker 3:  not much you can do to help them. You're just stuck with the app that they

253
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,140
Speaker 3:  give you. But at the same time, they're so entrenched in our lives and

254
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,140
Speaker 3:  so often set in their ways just like people are that I think most

255
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,860
Speaker 3:  developers would look at this market and just decide not to even

256
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,140
Speaker 3:  try. I mean the network effects of messaging are massive. The switching

257
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,660
Speaker 3:  costs are super high. There's really not much reason to think you can make

258
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,660
Speaker 3:  a dent at all in the messaging world at this point. Many have tried and frankly

259
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,420
Speaker 3:  many have failed. But then here comes Eric and Beeper trying to do it anyway.

260
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,260
Speaker 3:  So, I just asked him, what made you look at this space and think you

261
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,060
Speaker 3:  could hack it?

262
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,340
Speaker 4:  Our long-term vision is to build the best damn chat app on earth.

263
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,360
Speaker 4:  It's as simple as that. We think chat is, like I said before, something that

264
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,920
Speaker 4:  we do dozens if not hundreds of times per day. And it deserves attention.

265
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,880
Speaker 4:  It deserves to have a set of people building an experience that

266
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,360
Speaker 4:  continues to get better, that that really pushes the boundary on what's possible

267
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,400
Speaker 4:  with chat. And I don't feel like there's anyone carrying the torch

268
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,280
Speaker 4:  today. If you look at the top companies in chat, none of them are

269
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,080
Speaker 4:  incentivized to build a better experience. Their only incentive is to

270
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,160
Speaker 4:  keep you locked into their platform so that they make money through some

271
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,040
Speaker 4:  ulterior motive.

272
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,080
Speaker 3:  That's how Apple sells iPhones. The blue bubble thing is just as real as

273
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,400
Speaker 3:  it gets.

274
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,400
Speaker 4:  So our simple thing is we wanna build a great chat app

275
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,640
Speaker 4:  and we will charge people money to use it. Not everyone, there's

276
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,240
Speaker 4:  gonna be a a free option to use Beeper, but we think that there's a

277
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,080
Speaker 4:  You know there's 3 billion people in the world who use chat on a daily basis.

278
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,680
Speaker 4:  Some percentage of them we could argue about the exact number. We'll be interested

279
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,360
Speaker 4:  in paying for a better experience. Those are the people that we're intending

280
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,160
Speaker 4:  to capture and You know build an increasingly better chat

281
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,760
Speaker 4:  experience.

282
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,040
Speaker 3:  Was that the kind of original insight that like we can do

283
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,960
Speaker 3:  something powerful just by putting all of these things in one place?

284
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,080
Speaker 4:  The original insight, it started to solve a personal problem. Okay. Like

285
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,440
Speaker 4:  I have two friends on Google Talk or Google Chat or whatever it's called

286
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,240
Speaker 4:  today. I have three friends on WeChat. I have two friends on

287
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,200
Speaker 4:  Telegram and I just got sick and tired of there being 10 different

288
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,120
Speaker 4:  apps on my phone that kind of did exactly the same thing, albeit with a slightly

289
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,800
Speaker 4:  different contact list. I just wanted a single app, a

290
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,760
Speaker 4:  single search box that I could type in anyone's name and instantly start

291
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,880
Speaker 4:  chatting with them. I didn't want to have to remember like I basically

292
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,720
Speaker 4:  had this lookup table in my mind that matched each person,

293
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,720
Speaker 4:  each friend, each, each family member and which Neli, which app they used.

294
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,760
Speaker 4:  Computers are much better than us at doing that. They can memorize, they're

295
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,560
Speaker 4:  really good at lookup tables. So all I wanted to do was build

296
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,520
Speaker 4:  something that would allow me to just type in someone's name and start chatting

297
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,120
Speaker 4:  with them and not have that cognitive overhead of like, wait, where? Where

298
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,960
Speaker 4:  were we chatting? Was it like LinkedIn chat or was it like the little

299
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,800
Speaker 4:  sidebar chat in a Google Docs? Like I just wanted one single place that I

300
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,200
Speaker 4:  could use to chat with everyone.

301
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,160
Speaker 3:  I had a friend for many years who would, every time I would message him,

302
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,720
Speaker 3:  he would message me back on a different platform. I

303
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,320
Speaker 4:  Like that. That's chaotic. Good.

304
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,240
Speaker 3:  Honestly, it was great. He, it was the funniest thing and so every one of

305
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,000
Speaker 3:  our conversations just made absolutely no sense because it was one out of

306
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,680
Speaker 3:  every like 12 messages of our conversation. But it really was, you could

307
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,600
Speaker 3:  go an alarmingly long time without ever repeating chat apps. It

308
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,640
Speaker 3:  was kind of incredible. Still

309
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,560
Speaker 4:  Happens. Like You know you start something on Instagram because you're responding

310
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,200
Speaker 4:  to their story and then you see a funny tweet and you send them a TWI Twitter

311
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,320
Speaker 4:  dmm. Yeah. And then someone asks for an intro in LinkedIn, like it

312
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,640
Speaker 4:  adds up. I like to think of it as currently

313
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,720
Speaker 4:  this tax on top of every sort of communication,

314
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,880
Speaker 4:  it's not a big tax. It's You know a couple percent of

315
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,720
Speaker 4:  overhead to think about how am I gonna communicate with this person. But

316
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,240
Speaker 4:  think of how many times you communicate and if we can eliminate that tax,

317
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,000
Speaker 4:  Beeper has the potential to actually make the entire world

318
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,840
Speaker 4:  output of communication You know a couple percent

319
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,960
Speaker 4:  better. Yeah. And that's a pretty big opportunity.

320
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,240
Speaker 3:  Were you even aware that it was technically possible to do that at the

321
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,960
Speaker 3:  beginning? I mean you just described that shift when we went to mobile where

322
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,880
Speaker 3:  we went from having relatively intelligible protocols and

323
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,800
Speaker 3:  platforms to a bunch of totally siloed different systems.

324
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,280
Speaker 3:  Were you even sure that the thing you wanted could exist in the world we

325
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,760
Speaker 3:  live in now?

326
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,960
Speaker 4:  No. Okay. And I think that's kind of a good thing.

327
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,200
Speaker 4:  You know, I, I started a company before called Pebble. We built smartwatches.

328
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,320
Speaker 4:  I was 23. I knew nothing about building hardware and it was a good thing

329
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,080
Speaker 4:  because if I did I probably wouldn't have done it. And I think some of

330
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,800
Speaker 4:  the best companies are started because the founders are too naive to really

331
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,520
Speaker 4:  understand how crazy the journey that they're about to embark on is.

332
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,720
Speaker 4:  I think about that with Beeper as well. Like we spent the last two and a

333
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,640
Speaker 4:  half years understanding how each of these different protocols work, creating

334
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,200
Speaker 4:  what we call a bridge between Beeper and 15

335
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,600
Speaker 4:  different chat networks and perfecting them and making them work reliably.

336
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,600
Speaker 4:  That was very hard. That was incredibly hard. It still is hard but

337
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,760
Speaker 4:  It works and there's no going back. There's no way that I could switch

338
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,960
Speaker 4:  from using Beeper and being able to just seamlessly chat

339
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,680
Speaker 4:  with anyone to going back to having to remember like which

340
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,800
Speaker 4:  which app I'm on each person is on.

341
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Speaker 3:  I would think that along the way, especially at the beginning of this process,

342
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,440
Speaker 3:  you you would think to really do what we want to do, not only do we

343
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,360
Speaker 3:  have to connect all of these systems, we have to build a new one that's right

344
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,320
Speaker 3:  and better. And that Bieber becomes sort

345
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,000
Speaker 3:  of the gateway drug into this better thing, right? It's like come talk to

346
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,960
Speaker 3:  your Twitter DMM friends in Beeper. But we all know Twitter

347
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,960
Speaker 3:  dms is a bad product for messaging. It always has been. And

348
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,600
Speaker 3:  ultimately we're going to train you to use this better system that is our

349
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,400
Speaker 3:  system and that's how it's gonna work. Is that the

350
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,280
Speaker 3:  idea? Was that the idea to bring people, 'cause you talk about the A

351
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,880
Speaker 3:  P I and all this stuff you wanna do, you would need to build the whole thing

352
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,480
Speaker 3:  yourself at some point to do that, right?

353
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,200
Speaker 4:  So you raise a good point and it's the same one that You know

354
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,120
Speaker 4:  the X K C D guy wrote Sure You know 10, 15 years ago,

355
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,520
Speaker 4:  right? There's a classic X K C D for everything and this included

356
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,600
Speaker 4:  and it is You know a couple panels and I You know, hey there's 10 standards.

357
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,720
Speaker 4:  Let's make a new app that incorporates all these 10 standards. Oh and

358
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,680
Speaker 4:  now we have 11 standards. And so we didn't want be

359
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,120
Speaker 4:  part of the problem, we didn't want to go and create yet another messaging

360
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,480
Speaker 4:  standard. And so we looked at what was out there and the best open source

361
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,120
Speaker 4:  protocol that kind of checks all the boxes is one called Matrix.

362
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,520
Speaker 4:  Matrix is a protocol similar to, you can kind

363
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,440
Speaker 4:  of think of it as a spiritual successor to Jabber or X M P

364
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,280
Speaker 4:  P using no-code from X M P P. It's just a brand new implementation.

365
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,480
Speaker 4:  It's not perfect You know, no Open standard is, but we decided to adopt it

366
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,920
Speaker 4:  because it represents the best way for us to be

367
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,760
Speaker 4:  part of a broader network without creating yet another closed

368
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,400
Speaker 4:  siloed standard and contributing back to the problem. So we chose to use

369
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,240
Speaker 4:  an open standard called Matrix. It is federated, which means

370
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,720
Speaker 4:  that if you run your own server or if You know your, your account is on a

371
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,440
Speaker 4:  different matrix server, you can still talk to someone who's on Beeper. It's

372
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,000
Speaker 4:  very similar to email in that regard. Like you have an account on Beeper,

373
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,440
Speaker 4:  you have an account on Gmail, you can still send messages to people who have

374
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,240
Speaker 4:  different email servers. But Beeper is a private company.

375
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,200
Speaker 4:  It's a not open source application and we're designed to be You know just

376
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,920
Speaker 4:  an excellent experience on top of this open source standard. And similar

377
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,000
Speaker 4:  to Gmail, you probably don't understand the intricacies of IMAP or POP

378
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,120
Speaker 4:  or whatever. You know

379
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,320
Speaker 3:  And God help you if you do at this point.

380
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,280
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You don't have to, you just You know. You could just chat with your

381
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,480
Speaker 4:  friends

382
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,160
Speaker 3:  From a product perspective. You come into this and on the one hand,

383
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,360
Speaker 3:  messaging is this incredibly entrenched thing that we've been doing roughly

384
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,800
Speaker 3:  the same way for a very long time. You know you mentioned you have the, the

385
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,880
Speaker 3:  list on the left side and the conversation on the right that goes back not

386
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,800
Speaker 3:  just to how we message but like decades of email, right? Like everybody's

387
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,840
Speaker 3:  inbox is the same thing and has been forever. Yeah. All the way back to the

388
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,680
Speaker 3:  beginning of the internet. That is what conversation has looked like. I

389
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,240
Speaker 3:  think you could make a very compelling case that that is not the only or

390
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,120
Speaker 3:  best answer, but it is the answer right now. And So I, I,

391
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,200
Speaker 3:  I'm curious even at the very beginning of deciding how do we want this thing

392
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,920
Speaker 3:  to work And, what do we want it to look like? You have to

393
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,320
Speaker 3:  decide between reinventing the wheel in potentially

394
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,280
Speaker 3:  very cool but really kind of jarring ways for people or doing

395
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,280
Speaker 3:  the deeply boring old same thing that everybody

396
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,160
Speaker 3:  does that is fundamentally how people expect to message all the time. How

397
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,880
Speaker 3:  do you make that decision?

398
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,160
Speaker 4:  So there's a couple competing veins here. One is that we have muscle

399
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,640
Speaker 4:  memory for chat whether we like it or not, we've been using the same

400
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,960
Speaker 4:  software for the last 10, 15 years and that muscle memory is very

401
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,760
Speaker 4:  strong. Like you have a physical like picking up and unlocking your phone

402
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,640
Speaker 4:  is a physical twitch that we all, that we all have.

403
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,240
Speaker 3:  Totally. It's like the example of in, in the most recent iOS when they moved

404
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,120
Speaker 3:  the hangup button from the middle to the right, everybody freaked out 'cause

405
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,760
Speaker 3:  it's, you just You know where the buttons are.

406
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,440
Speaker 4:  We found that with Beeper, even though there are improvements that we're

407
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,160
Speaker 4:  making to the chat experience, people still have that

408
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,800
Speaker 4:  need to have something familiar. Let me put a pin in that for a sec to, to

409
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,960
Speaker 4:  kind of describe what our intention is for the last 10 years.

410
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,400
Speaker 4:  The app that you use to chat on a particular chat

411
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,080
Speaker 4:  network is a one-to-one mapping to that network. Like you can only use the

412
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,440
Speaker 4:  WhatsApp app to chat on WhatsApp. You can only use the iMessage app to chat

413
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,280
Speaker 4:  on iMessage. There has never been a delinking between the

414
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,160
Speaker 4:  network and the, the software that's used to chat on that. Now I don't want

415
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,000
Speaker 4:  to give the crypto people too much credit, but one of the ideas in

416
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,760
Speaker 4:  the, in the crypto world is this idea of separating the protocol

417
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,920
Speaker 4:  from the application. And I think that's what we're doing with

418
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:04,120
Speaker 4:  Beeper. We are for the first time separating the

419
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:08,160
Speaker 4:  UI that you use to interact with a particular chat network from

420
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,960
Speaker 4:  that chat networks first party software, which gives us the ability

421
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,920
Speaker 4:  to experiment in a way that these first party You know

422
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,680
Speaker 4:  chat apps basically can't do because they have 3 billion users and

423
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,920
Speaker 4:  you can't experiment too much with You know an app that that has that large

424
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,600
Speaker 4:  an install base.

425
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,360
Speaker 3:  Give me an example of something you could have done that might have been

426
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,400
Speaker 3:  better but you couldn't do because it's just not how It works.

427
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,760
Speaker 4:  A very small example is over the summer we had an intern build a widget

428
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,680
Speaker 4:  framework for Beeper that lets you install widgets

429
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,680
Speaker 4:  on the side panel of your chat. Similar to how Gmail has You know

430
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,800
Speaker 4:  plugins and You know you could download a Chrome extension, never been

431
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,960
Speaker 4:  possible, like no amount of money could have given you a widget on the side

432
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,640
Speaker 4:  of your iMessage chat, right? And we did it, he did it in

433
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,680
Speaker 4:  You know a couple weeks because we had already separated the protocol from

434
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,240
Speaker 4:  the application and some of the fun widgets that we made were

435
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,040
Speaker 4:  like a summarization widget that used chat G B T or Anthropic to

436
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,760
Speaker 4:  summarize what the You know. You log in the morning to Slack and you see

437
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,320
Speaker 4:  a bunch of unread messages and you're just like, what, what happened? What

438
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,480
Speaker 4:  did I miss? And here it's just a button in the side panel that you just press

439
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,000
Speaker 4:  it and it just tells you what you missed. That took like two days to build.

440
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,920
Speaker 4:  And it's only possible because we've separated that the the protocol from

441
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,680
Speaker 4:  the the application layer. So that's the same example, like we're still

442
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,440
Speaker 4:  early. I think we've worked really hard to get

443
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,960
Speaker 4:  the foundation to work to make sure that Bieber is reliable, to make sure

444
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,280
Speaker 4:  that it sends in receive messages remarkably hard, took longer than expected,

445
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,560
Speaker 4:  but we dedicated all of our effort just to doing that and it's still

446
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,080
Speaker 4:  taking quite a bit of our effort. So over time we'll begin to

447
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,480
Speaker 4:  use the fact that we have this kind of separation. But

448
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,240
Speaker 4:  honestly like some of the basics hadn't been done in messaging. Like

449
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,640
Speaker 4:  for example, Gmail over the last 10 years has evolved to have

450
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,880
Speaker 4:  archive states and tabs and all of these tools that

451
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,880
Speaker 4:  let you kind of manage the overflowing amount of email that you

452
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,720
Speaker 4:  get that overflow is shifting to chat. You know we are

453
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,640
Speaker 4:  getting not just spam and and junk messages, but we're just getting more

454
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,440
Speaker 4:  and more of our daily communication flowing through these

455
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,400
Speaker 4:  tools that haven't changed. And so a lot of what we did at Bieber was just

456
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:26,160
Speaker 4:  add kind of basic inbox management stuff that email has had forever

457
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,360
Speaker 4:  that make it a bit easier for you to deal with You know your inbox.

458
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,480
Speaker 4:  And we've added things like being able to archive messages. You can move

459
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:37,400
Speaker 4:  chats from your main inbox to other folders, you can mark

460
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,840
Speaker 4:  things as low priority. And those have been just incredibly helpful

461
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,680
Speaker 4:  for people that are using chat as their primary means of

462
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,240
Speaker 4:  communication.

463
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,680
Speaker 3:  Okay, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna get into where Beeper

464
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,280
Speaker 3:  goes from here.

465
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,650
Speaker 3:  All. right, we're back. Let's get back to talking about Bieber, which I really

466
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,810
Speaker 3:  do continue to think is one of the most interesting messaging apps on the

467
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,770
Speaker 3:  planet. And that's in part because its strategy is to like invade

468
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:52,690
Speaker 3:  the messaging app ecosystem as it already exists. I've

469
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:56,210
Speaker 3:  been using paper for a long time, like I said earlier, and I've kind of watched

470
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:00,130
Speaker 3:  the company lose connections to services and get them back and support new

471
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,970
Speaker 3:  stuff and drop support and re-add support. And in general, I just can't

472
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,410
Speaker 3:  imagine that the messaging apps, which like we've been talking about, don't

473
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:11,210
Speaker 3:  have APIs or developer platforms and really want you to stay in their walled

474
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,170
Speaker 3:  gardens are psyched that Beeper exists at all. So, I

475
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,970
Speaker 3:  just asked Eric, is this app a series of elaborate hacks

476
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,410
Speaker 3:  designed to get around messaging apps that would rather you not do all these

477
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,330
Speaker 3:  things? How much do these companies know or care what you're doing to their

478
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:26,610
Speaker 3:  systems?

479
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,130
Speaker 4:  You know at the end of the day, these are your chats, these are your

480
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:35,090
Speaker 4:  friends, these are your connections, this is your life. Like our

481
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,270
Speaker 4:  life is illustrated by the messages that we send to, to our

482
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,720
Speaker 4:  friends and family and and our colleagues. You know a lot of the, the, the

483
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,480
Speaker 4:  kind of AI one-offs that you've seen are people like training an AI

484
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,320
Speaker 4:  on their chat messages. That's because You know your messages. Are you

485
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,880
Speaker 4:  like, they are an embodiment of, of kind of your, your relationships and

486
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,720
Speaker 4:  your connections. And I think what we're doing is saying like you

487
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,640
Speaker 4:  should be in control of your own messages. And it's remarkable how we

488
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,600
Speaker 4:  take that for granted on other things like email or calls or Google

489
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:09,320
Speaker 4:  Docs or whatever. Like all of all of the other forms of You know

490
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,480
Speaker 4:  communication are your own, they're they're owned by you. But chat, we

491
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,280
Speaker 4:  kind of have accepted this, this world where like there's these

492
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,640
Speaker 4:  silos and those chats are stuck in the silo and we're gonna be okay with

493
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,200
Speaker 4:  it. I think what we're doing is saying like, no, actually

494
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,000
Speaker 4:  you should be in control of who you're chatting with and you should have

495
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,040
Speaker 4:  access to your message history and you should be able to decide You know

496
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,200
Speaker 4:  which, which client you use to send messages on each of these different networks.

497
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,400
Speaker 4:  And that's all we're doing. Like you can kind of think of it as a browser.

498
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,880
Speaker 4:  You know when you open up instagram.com in

499
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,200
Speaker 4:  Chrome or in Arc or in Brave, you're

500
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,880
Speaker 4:  still just You know sending and receiving messages on Instagram. That's basically

501
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,800
Speaker 4:  how Bieber works.

502
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,120
Speaker 3:  Okay. I believe you that you believe that I am less

503
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,040
Speaker 3:  convinced that Apple thinks all of my iMessages belong

504
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,040
Speaker 3:  to me and our mind to do with as I please. I think you're right. I'm just

505
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,440
Speaker 3:  not sure that's a super popular opinion in the messaging world.

506
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,000
Speaker 4:  I think honestly like kind of doesn't matter what Apple thinks, there's 3 billion

507
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,640
Speaker 4:  people who use chat in the world. There's a lot more of us than than them

508
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,240
Speaker 4:  at this point. And it matters what you think is right

509
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,520
Speaker 4:  And so it is to a certain degree up to us as

510
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,440
Speaker 4:  users of chat protocols and chat networks

511
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,560
Speaker 4:  to say, this is what I expect. This is my minimum bar. Part

512
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,320
Speaker 4:  of the reason why these companies can get away with it is it's practically

513
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:37,400
Speaker 4:  impossible to change. There is no free market right now in

514
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,480
Speaker 4:  messaging. Yeah, that's true. If you have You know an Android phone, you

515
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,720
Speaker 4:  can't send a message to someone on iMessage. If you are on WhatsApp, you

516
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,520
Speaker 4:  can't send a message to someone who is on Telegram. And these companies

517
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,480
Speaker 4:  exploit that kind of social dynamic to make it

518
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,440
Speaker 4:  harder for you to actually harder for companies like Beeper or or

519
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,160
Speaker 4:  other chat providers to actually compete on in terms of features or

520
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,880
Speaker 4:  capabilities. The lock-in effect is, is real. Yeah.

521
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:08,040
Speaker 4:  And so what what we're doing is like giving people a choice

522
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,080
Speaker 4:  for the first time, giving You know Americans, giving Europeans, giving people

523
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,600
Speaker 4:  around the world a chance to actually choose which software they think

524
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,600
Speaker 4:  offers them a better experience without having to worry about the lock-in

525
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,400
Speaker 4:  effect. And if you look at the kind of wins

526
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,200
Speaker 4:  of change in Europe with the Digital Markets Act

527
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,000
Speaker 4:  or in the US with the American Innovation and Choice Online Act,

528
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,840
Speaker 4:  there are a few movements that are taking shape to say

529
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,320
Speaker 4:  actually You know for the good of us, for the good of You know the

530
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,360
Speaker 4:  world, we need to be able to have the freedom to choose. And

531
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,560
Speaker 4:  that's You know slowly happening. And I think it's gonna be harder for these

532
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,480
Speaker 4:  large companies to to, to come out with anti You know free

533
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,280
Speaker 4:  market anti-competitive products like the current suite of chat apps

534
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:53,720
Speaker 4:  in future.

535
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,680
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I I was gonna ask this question later, but since you brought it up

536
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,560
Speaker 3:  I'll just ask it now. The thing about the regulatory stuff, especially this

537
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,480
Speaker 3:  idea in the EU that chat apps essentially have to interoperate

538
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,160
Speaker 3:  that is, that is the road we are headed down.

539
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:06,960
Speaker 4:  It's the law

540
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,160
Speaker 3:  I've wondered for a long time whether that essentially

541
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,760
Speaker 3:  obviates Beeper over time because these apps you already use are gonna be

542
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,800
Speaker 3:  forced to integrate with one another. Or if it gives you an actually level

543
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,520
Speaker 3:  playing field to be on because instead of having your own it's fantastic.

544
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,000
Speaker 3:  It's fantastic. You're psyched about this, it's

545
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,640
Speaker 4:  Fantastic. Okay. Oh absolutely. Oh yeah. The world needs to have the ability

546
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,320
Speaker 4:  to communicate.

547
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:31,240
Speaker 3:  But no, I, I'm, I agree with that. Give me the like ruthless capitalist case

548
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,680
Speaker 3:  for why this is good for be

549
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,960
Speaker 4:  In terms of building a better chat experience. Are you gonna bet on the product

550
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,920
Speaker 4:  management team at Apple who builds iMessage and

551
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:45,040
Speaker 4:  makes small changes to the UI every year that don't really have

552
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,760
Speaker 4:  too much impact on how you use it? Or are you gonna bet on a company whose

553
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,880
Speaker 4:  entire life is chat and and our entire goal is

554
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,440
Speaker 4:  to build the best chat experience? Some of my favorite chat apps today are

555
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,240
Speaker 4:  Telegram and Discord. You know, besides Beeper, I think You know the Telegram

556
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,680
Speaker 4:  has a 30 person team. Theoretically, I think You know building

557
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,160
Speaker 4:  what's arguably a much better chat experience than any of these You know

558
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,920
Speaker 4:  larger, more well used apps. And so given the freedom

559
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,920
Speaker 4:  to message and and interoperate, yeah, You know beeper's gonna take off

560
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,760
Speaker 4:  because we offer a better experience than the other ones. And people

561
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,840
Speaker 4:  can't switch because You know they're currently locked in.

562
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,760
Speaker 3:  One other thing I have, I dunno, struggled is the wrong word, but I've, I've

563
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,600
Speaker 3:  thought about this a lot is I've been a Beeper user over the years. One thing

564
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,440
Speaker 3:  I keep doing all the time is turning on and off

565
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,560
Speaker 3:  LinkedIn and, and there's this thing that happens, it's made me realize like,

566
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,840
Speaker 3:  yes, all these apps are chat, but they have very different norms and they

567
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,120
Speaker 3:  have very different systems and I have really different rules in different

568
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,800
Speaker 3:  places for who's allowed to contact me and when, like if

569
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,520
Speaker 3:  I got as many messages on WhatsApp every day as I do on Slack,

570
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,440
Speaker 3:  my phone would explode. Which is not like a brag. People talk too much on

571
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,280
Speaker 3:  Slack, right? But is it doable do you think, to have all of

572
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,720
Speaker 3:  those systems and all of those norms and all of those unwritten rules about

573
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,600
Speaker 3:  how we talk to each other and about what, like to some extent you're doing

574
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,960
Speaker 3:  this like context collapse of all of these different places

575
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:12,920
Speaker 3:  into one thing in a way that's really useful but also really mind

576
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,240
Speaker 3:  bending for me. And sometimes like I go from one chat window when I'm talking

577
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,680
Speaker 3:  with my friends to another identical looking chat window where I'm talking

578
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,680
Speaker 3:  to like the random person who just added me on LinkedIn and that's

579
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,640
Speaker 3:  really useful but also kind of mind bending in a way. Is it

580
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,520
Speaker 3:  possible to do all that?

581
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:32,840
Speaker 4:  What I've discovered through chatting with You know users of Beeper

582
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,240
Speaker 4:  and people who who chat a lot is that we all have this

583
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,080
Speaker 4:  internal heuristic that we've developed that helps us

584
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,880
Speaker 4:  assign a priority to messages that we receive.

585
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,800
Speaker 4:  LinkedIn sounds like it might not be a giant priority for you. Not super

586
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,640
Speaker 4:  high, no Slack, probably You know medium, maybe iMessage is your

587
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,560
Speaker 4:  top, like if you get a ping on iMessage, you're much more likely to to

588
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,200
Speaker 4:  read it. You hold, you hold this heuristic and you

589
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,160
Speaker 4:  use that daily to, to kind of prioritize incoming messages. You are

590
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,000
Speaker 4:  unique. No one else prioritizes messages in the exact same way

591
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:11,120
Speaker 4:  that you do. They should, I'm right. There's 15 different networks and everyone

592
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:15,000
Speaker 4:  is unique. Everyone is a butterfly. And what's interesting is that we all

593
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,560
Speaker 4:  think everyone else has the exact same heuristic.

594
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,760
Speaker 4:  And so this, this manifests itself in some complicated ways. When you

595
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,120
Speaker 4:  send someone a message on iMessage and they're in Europe, you think that

596
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,800
Speaker 4:  you're now trying to be like the most important. Like you think that because

597
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,280
Speaker 4:  you assign a higher weight to iMessage. If you send someone to iMessage,

598
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,600
Speaker 4:  this means like, hey, you should You know respond to this because You know

599
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,160
Speaker 4:  this is an important message. But that's not necessarily their heuristic.

600
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:44,080
Speaker 4:  Take salespeople for example. I'm not a salesperson thankfully, but they

601
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,040
Speaker 4:  love LinkedIn. Salespeople love LinkedIn, recruiters love LinkedIn. And

602
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,000
Speaker 4:  so if they get a ping on LinkedIn, wow, like this might be like move

603
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,840
Speaker 4:  over rest of the day. Like this is the most important thing that came across

604
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,160
Speaker 4:  my desk. Think of demographics differences. Think of the difference between

605
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,400
Speaker 4:  Snapchat and Instagram. Think of the like subtle differences between friend

606
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,240
Speaker 4:  groups that are gamers on Discord versus You know open

607
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,080
Speaker 4:  source hackers on I R C. Everyone has a

608
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,320
Speaker 4:  slightly different way of balancing that priority. And this

609
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,560
Speaker 4:  is one of the biggest challenges that we face at Beeper. We

610
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,480
Speaker 4:  pull in that messages from all of your different networks and

611
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,160
Speaker 4:  that's great for all the reasons that I outlined around You. know, having

612
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,040
Speaker 4:  one search box, having one single app to install on each of your devices,

613
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:33,200
Speaker 4:  it does sacrifice right now some of the metadata that's

614
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,160
Speaker 4:  associated with the, it's like the game behind the game, right?

615
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,200
Speaker 4:  When you get a pinging on Instagram or you might not even have notifications

616
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,120
Speaker 4:  set up for Instagram, right? You might not assign any weight to Instagram.

617
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,720
Speaker 4:  We miss that and that's something that we are looking at how we can actually

618
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,640
Speaker 4:  reintegrate that into, into our system. So it's, it's on the, it's on the

619
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,760
Speaker 4:  to-do list. It's something that we're working on. But I would hazard a guess

620
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,120
Speaker 4:  to say that those network-based heuristics

621
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,000
Speaker 4:  that you've developed are only an approximation of the

622
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,600
Speaker 4:  actual priority. They're good rules of thumb,

623
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,960
Speaker 4:  but not a hundred percent. Like for example, LinkedIn,

624
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,600
Speaker 4:  I get a lot of spam on LinkedIn, but it's one of the only open

625
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:17,080
Speaker 4:  inboxes that I have on the internet. Like I, I have my Twitter dms open,

626
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,520
Speaker 4:  but for most people, LinkedIn is the only way that friends from high school

627
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:24,080
Speaker 4:  could contact them because your LinkedIn probably shows up at the top of

628
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,600
Speaker 4:  You, know the Google search for your, for your name. And

629
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,800
Speaker 4:  occasionally I get really heartfelt and interesting

630
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,840
Speaker 4:  messages sent to me, me via LinkedIn because that's the only way that people

631
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,560
Speaker 4:  who don't have my phone number or email address can contact. And I think

632
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,400
Speaker 4:  about that a lot that the best system for relative

633
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,800
Speaker 4:  priority ranking is one based on the person that's

634
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,600
Speaker 4:  trying to contact you. The type of message You know and the

635
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,400
Speaker 4:  meta kind of relationship that you have with that person. And all of that

636
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,280
Speaker 4:  data is in Beeper. And so one of the things that we're working

637
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:02,200
Speaker 4:  on is how we can use that metadata. How frequently do you talk

638
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,960
Speaker 4:  to this person? Have you talked to them in the past but you haven't talked

639
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,480
Speaker 4:  to them in years? Have they sent their 30th message to you today? Like

640
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,240
Speaker 4:  how quickly do you respond to them? Do you respond to them on multiple platforms?

641
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,440
Speaker 4:  Is this a person that you talk to on Instagram, iMessage,

642
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,960
Speaker 4:  and Slack? Is this a work contact? Do they talk to you mostly during

643
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,600
Speaker 4:  work hours? Are you part of groups with them? There's so much metadata that

644
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,280
Speaker 4:  can be used to assign or or help like gauge priority.

645
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,600
Speaker 4:  And I'm really excited that we are the first platform ever

646
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,840
Speaker 4:  that has clear visibility into all of these different signals.

647
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,840
Speaker 4:  And one of our big initiatives is figuring out how we can integrate these

648
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,640
Speaker 4:  signals in a simple enough way to help you make

649
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,440
Speaker 4:  better prioritization decisions so that you don't have to use a hard and

650
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,320
Speaker 4:  fast rule. A clunky rule like LinkedIn is not useful to me. It

651
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,040
Speaker 4:  might work most of the time, but I wanna figure out a way that we can actually

652
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,280
Speaker 4:  get that nugget of gold. That one old friend that sent you a LinkedIn

653
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,480
Speaker 4:  message that you would not have actually read for years if you don't, if

654
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,320
Speaker 4:  you don't go to your LinkedIn inbox like I used to and bubble that up.

655
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,440
Speaker 4:  And at the same time, You know the heuristic that you've set up, which is

656
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,120
Speaker 4:  iMessage is king, right? That is You know the, the main network.

657
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,280
Speaker 4:  It's not as good as of a high signal to noise ratio as you think it is. No,

658
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,840
Speaker 4:  there's two factor off codes. There's DoorDash, there's Uber receipts, there's

659
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:26,000
Speaker 4:  spam, there's s m s, there's all this crap. Yeah, there's groups that people

660
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,920
Speaker 4:  add you to that you don't really want to see at the top of your inbox, but

661
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,160
Speaker 4:  you don't really wanna leave. Yeah. So, I, again, this all goes back to the

662
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,920
Speaker 4:  idea that like we want to make the best chat app on earth

663
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,480
Speaker 4:  and part of that means highlighting the people that matter, highlighting

664
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,160
Speaker 4:  the relationships, the conversations that that matter and and

665
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,200
Speaker 4:  bubbling those to the top.

666
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:49,240
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And that totally tracks for me and also brings up, I think one of these

667
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,400
Speaker 3:  sort of great tensions of building an app like paper. I can't prove this,

668
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,320
Speaker 3:  but one of the theories that I have that I think is right based on

669
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,560
Speaker 3:  talking to people for a long time about this is that one of the reasons it's

670
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,520
Speaker 3:  very hard to do things in chat apps is that it reminds people

671
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:07,680
Speaker 3:  that you're reading their messages when Google's assistant shows up and

672
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,360
Speaker 3:  is like, oh, would you like to buy movie tickets? Yeah. Part of that is annoying.

673
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:14,040
Speaker 3:  Part of it is a reminder that there is a Google system that is aware of what

674
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,880
Speaker 3:  I'm saying to my friend and that feels bad. And So I think these, these

675
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,680
Speaker 3:  companies go way outta their way to say, no, no, no, no, we're not looking,

676
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,280
Speaker 3:  we don't care. We don't tell ads against it. Like, no, no, no, we're not,

677
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,640
Speaker 3:  we're not even gonna touch it. Your chats or your chats.

678
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,120
Speaker 4:  But do you believe that, I mean no, but all of your Instagram messages are

679
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,960
Speaker 4:  on their servers and and you're getting increasingly more targeted messages

680
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,920
Speaker 4:  in your stories. Like

681
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,640
Speaker 3:  Oh yeah. To be clear, I don't, I don't think that's actually true in many

682
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,880
Speaker 3:  cases. I actually think, ironically, there was this thing recently with Elon

683
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,720
Speaker 3:  Musk and X, they said, we're going to use your posts, including your dms

684
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,320
Speaker 3:  to train ai. And a bunch of people freaked out. And our overarching

685
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,840
Speaker 3:  conversation pretty quickly got to like, well, yeah, of course that's what

686
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,280
Speaker 3:  everybody's doing. Like how do you not think that's what's happening on all

687
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,320
Speaker 3:  of these services? That's a separate problem. I, I agree. That's a problem.

688
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,880
Speaker 3:  I think it's a problem worth solving. But I think the challenge is to say,

689
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:04,400
Speaker 3:  we're going to give you lots of things on top of your chats. We're gonna

690
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,680
Speaker 3:  do all kinds of cool things based on who we know you care about, what you're

691
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,160
Speaker 3:  talking about, the summarization stuff you're talking about without making

692
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,080
Speaker 3:  it feel like we're intruding on your private life, which is what my chats

693
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,760
Speaker 3:  are. And again, I, I believe there are lots of good reasons to not

694
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:22,920
Speaker 3:  talk in all the places that we talk, but we do. And I think any

695
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,960
Speaker 3:  reminder of that is always gonna feel bad to people. Yeah. How

696
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,960
Speaker 3:  do you get people to make that trade or at least kind of agree to

697
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,360
Speaker 3:  go along that ride with you over time?

698
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,440
Speaker 4:  I don't think it's a trade. I think that most of the things that we're doing

699
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,680
Speaker 4:  are bog simple things that should have been done 10 years ago.

700
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:44,600
Speaker 4:  Like archiving. Okay. Right. You know that's just a simple button in Beeper

701
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,120
Speaker 4:  that says, I don't want to see this chat in my inbox anymore. Sure. Simple

702
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:48,520
Speaker 4:  as that.

703
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,640
Speaker 3:  But the thing where you're describing like, I wanna be able to bubble up

704
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,880
Speaker 3:  the most important thing on your LinkedIn to the top, like objectively good

705
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,560
Speaker 3:  useful feature requires knowing things about me.

706
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,880
Speaker 4:  It does, but the beauty of Beeper is that we're giving you access to your

707
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,840
Speaker 4:  own messages locally on your device. Beeper is

708
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,280
Speaker 4:  fully encrypted. We don't have a copy of your messages on our servers. We

709
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,320
Speaker 4:  couldn't read your messages on our servers if, if we wanted to. Like your

710
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,680
Speaker 4:  history is, is encrypted with a key that only You know.

711
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,320
Speaker 3:  Did you set it up that way on purpose? Like was it obvious to you? Yeah.

712
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,680
Speaker 3:  That that was the way to do it? Okay.

713
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,760
Speaker 4:  Absolutely. A hundred percent. And what's cool is that everyone has a phone.

714
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:27,920
Speaker 4:  These phones have tons of storage. We can store a copy

715
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:32,000
Speaker 4:  of your entire communication history on your

716
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,920
Speaker 4:  phone. It takes a couple gigs. That's our plan. Store a copy of your

717
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,720
Speaker 4:  messages locally on your device. We don't even upload your contact list.

718
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,520
Speaker 4:  You know your contact. Like we're the only chat app in the world that doesn't

719
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,200
Speaker 4:  upload your contact list. That's true. Right? Like we use the contact list

720
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,840
Speaker 4:  locally to be able to match like this person's phone number is associated

721
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,560
Speaker 4:  with this person's name. So eventually you'll be able to say, this person

722
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,800
Speaker 4:  on LinkedIn is the same as this person over here in iMessage. And those

723
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:02,480
Speaker 4:  links will strengthen kind of the relationship in, in beeper's

724
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,440
Speaker 4:  eyes. And again, this is like, we're not planning to do

725
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,360
Speaker 4:  rocket science here of like creating

726
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:13,600
Speaker 4:  complicated AI models, You know, trained, it's like basic

727
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,520
Speaker 4:  stuff. Like is this name the same on iMessage as

728
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,000
Speaker 4:  in LinkedIn? When was the last time I talked to them on

729
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:25,080
Speaker 4:  Instagram? Like how many stories have I liked of theirs? It's

730
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:29,040
Speaker 4:  all local, it's all just in your message history. And it

731
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,080
Speaker 4:  doesn't need to be uploaded anywhere. It could be all done inside the Beeper

732
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,280
Speaker 4:  app.

733
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,640
Speaker 3:  Are phone numbers the like universal username at this

734
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:36,840
Speaker 3:  point?

735
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,520
Speaker 4:  Mostly ish, but not exact. Not not entirely. Are

736
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,840
Speaker 3:  We good with phone numbers as as the universal username?

737
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:48,120
Speaker 4:  No. I, I think it's, it's it's pragmatic. It's the best option that we have.

738
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:51,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But Beeper is not built on top of a phone number. It's built on top

739
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,480
Speaker 4:  of more like an email address handle. But

740
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,840
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it's, it's, it is interesting 'cause it does seem like, I'm just trying

741
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,560
Speaker 3:  to think of what is the one piece of information that all of these services

742
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,200
Speaker 3:  know about me? And it's probably my phone number.

743
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Unfortunately for some networks like Instagram and Facebook, that's

744
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,720
Speaker 4:  not actually exposed. So Facebook and Instagram though, for damn sure they

745
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,840
Speaker 4:  know everything about you. Oh yes. But that's not even exposed to you as

746
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,760
Speaker 4:  a user. You can't, you have to upload your entire contact list in order to

747
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,320
Speaker 4:  see which of your friends are on Instagram. There's no way to say like, is

748
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,600
Speaker 4:  this phone number also on Instagram?

749
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:24,840
Speaker 3:  How broad do you think this goes? I think if I were to look at people right

750
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,080
Speaker 3:  now, I would say you're in a place of sort of what I would call relatively

751
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,000
Speaker 3:  synchronous chat. If I, I don't know if you have a better term for it than

752
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,760
Speaker 3:  I do, but it's like, it's relatively fast moving. It's not,

753
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,760
Speaker 4:  I call it consumer chat versus something like enterprise or

754
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,800
Speaker 4:  kind of community-based chat. It's like dms, small group chats.

755
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:45,360
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's our core kind of bread and butter right

756
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,520
Speaker 3:  Now. That makes sense. But I also think a, a lot of the stuff we've been

757
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,920
Speaker 3:  talking about in chat also exists in places like,

758
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,320
Speaker 3:  I don't know, video chat, You know, speaking of things with a million different

759
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,680
Speaker 3:  standards Yeah. That all compete with each other. You could talk yourself

760
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,000
Speaker 3:  into being an email client in a way that's useful without trying super hard.

761
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,520
Speaker 3:  Like how far out from consumer chat do you think

762
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,080
Speaker 3:  Beeper goes over time or It's useful to think about

763
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:11,120
Speaker 4:  What I love about chat And. what gets me so excited about working on,

764
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,280
Speaker 4:  on building this product is it's an ever present. Well, we can

765
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,560
Speaker 4:  always come back to it because it's such an innate human tendency.

766
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,840
Speaker 4:  We want to communicate, we are social beings and so

767
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,120
Speaker 4:  whenever we need things to work on, we just go back to the well and we say,

768
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,040
Speaker 4:  how could we make this aspect of communication better?

769
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,360
Speaker 4:  I think we're definitely focused on chat. There's so many problems with

770
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,240
Speaker 4:  chat that we have not You know even scratched the surface in terms of improvements

771
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,200
Speaker 4:  and things that we can do. But if you extend this out 5, 10, 20 years,

772
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:46,840
Speaker 4:  there is no other company You know besides us that is entirely

773
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,720
Speaker 4:  focused on building an amazing communication experience. And

774
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,640
Speaker 4:  that is our entire goal. Like we will continue to build things that

775
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,600
Speaker 4:  we think make it easier for people to communicate, make it more

776
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,840
Speaker 4:  seamless, make it lower friction. And then You know after we

777
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,280
Speaker 4:  get kind of a handle on what we have today, what are different modalities

778
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,040
Speaker 4:  that we could use for communication? You know hardware dies hard

779
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,760
Speaker 4:  with a hardware person like me. If you look at every computing

780
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,960
Speaker 4:  platform, the killer app has always been chat. If not

781
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,960
Speaker 4:  You know communication to a certain degree and You know playing the clock

782
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,480
Speaker 4:  forward a little bit. We are You know, I am

783
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:29,760
Speaker 4:  floored by the fact that I have seven Google homes in my house

784
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,360
Speaker 4:  and I can't send a damn text message from them. Or

785
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,400
Speaker 4:  I can't send a message to my wife who has an Android phone and like

786
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,720
Speaker 4:  You know seamlessly start voice chatting with her. Like I

787
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,320
Speaker 4:  maybe if she had duo we might be able to, it's, it's just like there's no

788
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,440
Speaker 4:  way for us to do kind of simple communication. There's, there's all

789
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,120
Speaker 4:  these different apps and there's all these different devices, but there's

790
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,600
Speaker 4:  no one way to communicate. And I think that one of the things that,

791
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:59,200
Speaker 4:  again, going back to this idea that we have of separating the protocol from

792
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,760
Speaker 4:  the application, from the experience, we have this

793
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,760
Speaker 4:  unique ability to say we can communicate to anyone

794
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,720
Speaker 4:  on any chat network. Could we build an app for AirPods You

795
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,080
Speaker 4:  know that lets you just, you're, you're driving and instead of having to

796
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,040
Speaker 4:  mediate things through CarPlay or through Android Auto or something like

797
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,280
Speaker 4:  that. Like what if we could just override that and become your

798
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,720
Speaker 4:  earpiece that You know connects you to other people through deeper.

799
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:29,480
Speaker 4:  Same thing with around the home. But that's kind of boring and You know,

800
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,800
Speaker 4:  you could already predict that. Like I'm excited to think like in five years

801
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:37,240
Speaker 4:  what will we be doing? You know what, what new devices will we have

802
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,240
Speaker 4:  and how will we communicate on them? Yeah,

803
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,520
Speaker 3:  I think that's really interesting. And it also sounds like the road we're

804
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,000
Speaker 3:  headed down, which I think is the right one, but it's gonna be a really tricky

805
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,920
Speaker 3:  one to pull off is to separate the person from the app, right?

806
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,840
Speaker 3:  Like you're talking about the lookup table. It seems like the end result

807
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,160
Speaker 3:  is just that if I want to call you, I just call you and I actually don't

808
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,560
Speaker 3:  have to think about how it's calling you. It can call you on any number of

809
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,280
Speaker 3:  platforms and ultimately I don't have to care. Is that where we go?

810
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:07,360
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We're like, I mean the end result here is telepathy.

811
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:11,080
Speaker 4:  Like how can I send a message to you as a person rather than you

812
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,000
Speaker 4:  as an inbox in You know Facebook or iMessage or

813
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:15,240
Speaker 4:  whatever.

814
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:19,520
Speaker 3:  And you can do that without building yet another standard on top of all the

815
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,080
Speaker 3:  other standards.

816
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,400
Speaker 4:  I mean I hope so. And I think that You know once this gains

817
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,200
Speaker 4:  steam or gains momentum, I think that other people will realize

818
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,000
Speaker 4:  that as well and hopefully join in the fun because the real, the real

819
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,720
Speaker 4:  ticket here is building a better experience rather than a network that just

820
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,480
Speaker 4:  locks you in.

821
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,080
Speaker 3:  How is it going convincing people to pay for this? This is the kind of thing

822
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,960
Speaker 3:  people have never paid for except for like email sickos

823
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,680
Speaker 3:  who pay 30 bucks a month for superhuman. But this is not, consumer chat is

824
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,680
Speaker 3:  not a thing people are used to paying money for. And I grant that you're

825
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,200
Speaker 3:  offering You know different kinds of features and power user stuff that people

826
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,880
Speaker 3:  are willing to pay for, but ultimately long run. Can a

827
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,800
Speaker 3:  paid chat thing work?

828
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,440
Speaker 4:  I would say that people do pay for communication. We pay for tools that

829
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,400
Speaker 4:  help us communicate. We pay $80 a month for our phone

830
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,320
Speaker 4:  plans. Sure. We pay for any number of video chat

831
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,400
Speaker 4:  pieces of software You know that we use, it's a smaller budget

832
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,280
Speaker 4:  than it was in the nineties where we all had long distance plans as well.

833
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,440
Speaker 4:  Right. But there is a chunk of money that people will put towards

834
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,880
Speaker 4:  improving their communication. That's what we're going after, but we're also

835
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,880
Speaker 4:  looking to grow the pie.

836
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:30,640
Speaker 3:  Fair enough. All, right? Well we're gonna have to come back and do this again

837
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,280
Speaker 3:  because this Yeah, like you said, this stuff is not done changing. It's gonna

838
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,280
Speaker 3:  keep getting weird in, in fun ways, but thank you for doing this. I really

839
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,680
Speaker 3:  appreciate this. This is really fun. No,

840
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,800
Speaker 4:  Anytime It was good to chat.

841
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,360
Speaker 3:  All, right? That's it for The Vergecast today. Thanks so much to Eric for
