Description: Nilay, David, and Richard Lawler take on a big week in confusing news stories. First, they talk through the latest from Elon Musk's DOGE, which is running rampant through government computer systems with little pushback. Then they explain the latest on the US government's tariff strategy, and the mass confusion it's causing across tech. Then they pivot away from politics and talk about streaming: the Super Bowl coming to Tubi, the deeply confusing forthcoming Fox streaming service, whatever Comcast is doing this year, and more. Finally, in the lightning round, they talk about Sonos's streaming box, Brendan Carr's latest assaults on free speech, OpenAI's "new" logo, and more.

2
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:37,495
Speaker 4:  flagship podcast. The cost of about Hard fork. Our greatest rival. Ooh,

3
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:39,175
Speaker 4:  wouldn't that be great?

4
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:40,215
Speaker 5:  People would pay for that.

5
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:44,255
Speaker 4:  I think people would pay you thought you wanted no ads. What you really wanted

6
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:48,655
Speaker 4:  was unvarnished hard shots at Casey Newton

7
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:48,975
Speaker 4:  for us,

8
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:52,495
Speaker 5:  Do we have a podcast enemy? I feel like it like naturally it should be hard

9
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:56,535
Speaker 5:  fork, but Casey used to work at The Verge. We

10
00:00:56,695 --> 00:01:00,405
Speaker 5:  love Casey. We love Kevin. Like every Kevin

11
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:03,165
Speaker 5:  needs more people on his side because just Bing is out here just trying to

12
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:04,045
Speaker 5:  ruin his life and marriage.

13
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:07,725
Speaker 4:  Right. I'm saying Kevin needs more human beings to love him a hundred percent

14
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:10,565
Speaker 4:  because the robots Yeah, are aggressively trying to love that

15
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:13,645
Speaker 5:  Man. Yeah. So like Kevin, we're here. So like who's our enemy?

16
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:17,805
Speaker 5:  Can you email us and suggest an enemy for us? I would like to have one

17
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:21,765
Speaker 4:  And I'm down for fake beef. Like you want us to do a WWE style fake beef.

18
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:24,445
Speaker 4:  Absolutely. Like you let us know. The problem is that many of our wouldbe

19
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:27,605
Speaker 4:  rivals are also our friends and people who used to work here.

20
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:31,605
Speaker 4:  This is what happens when you build the network. This is my theory of true

21
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:33,845
Speaker 4:  power. Richard is like ready to go, by the way.

22
00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:35,165
Speaker 1:  Enemies.

23
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:39,125
Speaker 4:  You need more friends as Rob Poka says. Alright, it's The Vergecast. I'm

24
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:42,565
Speaker 4:  your friend Neli. That's Richard Lawler making a triumphant reappearance

25
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:46,615
Speaker 4:  on The Verge House. What's up buddy? Hello. And as always, David Pierces

26
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:47,135
Speaker 4:  here. Yeah,

27
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:52,895
Speaker 4:  There's a lot going on this week, including, like I said, just a number of

28
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:56,735
Speaker 4:  random shots at Hard Fork throughout this episode. I keep saying this and

29
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:59,655
Speaker 4:  now we have to deliver on it. We, we did not plan to actually take a bunch

30
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:02,335
Speaker 4:  of shots at Hard Fork on this episode, but we'll try. We'll, we'll do our

31
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:05,375
Speaker 4:  best. There is in fact a lot going on this week. Elon Musk has taken over

32
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,975
Speaker 4:  the government that seems notable. There's tariffs which

33
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:13,255
Speaker 4:  seem boring, but we'll dramatically affect the prices of basically every

34
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:16,055
Speaker 4:  tech product in big and small ways. We gotta talk about those a little bit.

35
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:20,535
Speaker 4:  Sonos has like a new streaming box. The Go 90 Scale

36
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:25,215
Speaker 4:  is here on our rundown triumphant return of the Go 90 scale. And then we

37
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:28,655
Speaker 4:  got a lightning round unsponsored because I'm gonna continue using lightning

38
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:32,055
Speaker 4:  round to dunk on Brendan Carr, our truest enemy.

39
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:36,045
Speaker 4:  I, I've come all the way around and realized that we do have an enemy here

40
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:38,045
Speaker 4:  on the vir chest. And it's FCC chair Brendan

41
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:40,965
Speaker 5:  Carr. Yeah, but he's not a podcast enemy. Brendan, start a podcast so you

42
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:41,805
Speaker 5:  can be our podcast enemy.

43
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:42,765
Speaker 4:  Don't give him ideas.

44
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:46,045
Speaker 5:  Could he investigate his own podcast?

45
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:50,525
Speaker 4:  This entire part of our lives, like of American

46
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:53,845
Speaker 4:  History is tire some bureaucrats with podcasts pretending they're the voice

47
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:57,645
Speaker 4:  of the people. Don't, I mean it's fine. Alright, let's start with

48
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,365
Speaker 4:  whatever is going on with Elon Musk and Doge. It has been a long week,

49
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,365
Speaker 4:  A long week with high highs and lows of this news cycle.

50
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:09,645
Speaker 4:  Stuff that isn't real, stuff that seems very real lawsuits.

51
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:13,725
Speaker 4:  The Doge being blocked from access to treasury department, payment systems

52
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:18,245
Speaker 4:  getting only read only access or big fight about that. Senator Ron

53
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:22,125
Speaker 4:  Wyden was on decoder this week and he said For all practical purposes,

54
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:26,165
Speaker 4:  I'd call that a coup. We're all over the place. David, you have

55
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:29,445
Speaker 4:  been sort of an impartial observer. You're just taking it all in. Explain

56
00:03:29,445 --> 00:03:32,685
Speaker 4:  what's going on and how people should think about it. It's simple task, really.

57
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:36,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think that the simplest way I can put this

58
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:40,645
Speaker 5:  in, in like honest human terms is that Elon Musk and

59
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:44,365
Speaker 5:  a small group of people he appointed or hired or

60
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:48,525
Speaker 5:  I don't know, met on the internet in some way have like in a relatively meaningful

61
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:51,565
Speaker 5:  way, taken over the federal government over the course of,

62
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:56,405
Speaker 5:  I would say especially the last 10 days. But like it, it sort of

63
00:03:56,405 --> 00:04:00,005
Speaker 5:  ramped up all this week they've gone from

64
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:03,365
Speaker 5:  agency to agency and essentially barged in demanding

65
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,885
Speaker 5:  complete access to everything. Like you said, they, they've been demanding

66
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:10,765
Speaker 5:  payment information at the Treasury department, which has obviously gigantic

67
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:13,525
Speaker 5:  ramifications because that's where all the money is in the government and

68
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:17,285
Speaker 5:  there's a lot of money in the government. They've been in noaa, the, the

69
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:19,125
Speaker 5:  Oceanic and Like

70
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:19,765
Speaker 4:  Atmosphere.

71
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:23,885
Speaker 5:  The atmosphere. Thank you. Yeah. They've been in noaa, the Oceanic and Atmosphere

72
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:27,805
Speaker 5:  Agency, which is the one that does all the weather stuff. By the way, If

73
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:31,525
Speaker 5:  you have never read Michael Lewis's book, the Fifth Risk, he has a whole

74
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:35,285
Speaker 5:  thing about the fact that they do all the interesting work on weather and

75
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:38,445
Speaker 5:  that a bunch of lobbyists have made it so that they're not allowed to do

76
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,765
Speaker 5:  anything with it. And so that's why you pay money for weather forecasts.

77
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:45,805
Speaker 5:  That's a random aside, but is a perfect microcosm of like the disaster of

78
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:49,725
Speaker 5:  all of this stuff. They've essentially, for all

79
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:53,245
Speaker 5:  intents and purposes, shut down usaid while Elon Musk has been

80
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:56,565
Speaker 5:  tweeting conspiracy theories about how it's a criminal organization.

81
00:04:57,115 --> 00:05:00,805
Speaker 5:  There's just all kinds of weird stuff going on. So a lot of it

82
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:01,165
Speaker 5:  is

83
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:06,755
Speaker 5:  bad, but in a way we don't totally understand. There, there is a, there is

84
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:10,515
Speaker 5:  a sort of incredible amount of access

85
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:14,515
Speaker 5:  and information that these unelected, unqualified people

86
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:18,475
Speaker 5:  have access to. What that is going to mean in the

87
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:21,275
Speaker 5:  short, medium and long term is still in some ways hard to know. It means

88
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:24,155
Speaker 5:  a lot of people are out of jobs. It means a lot of your information is available

89
00:05:24,155 --> 00:05:27,715
Speaker 5:  to people to whom it should not be available. But I think we're still at

90
00:05:27,715 --> 00:05:31,675
Speaker 5:  the very beginning of a people understanding that this

91
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:35,555
Speaker 5:  is really happening. Like the big other push this week was a lot of people

92
00:05:35,555 --> 00:05:39,275
Speaker 5:  being like, how were you allowing this to happen? And we spent the whole

93
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:42,835
Speaker 5:  week I think of a lot of people, Democrats in particular sitting there being

94
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:46,675
Speaker 5:  like, this can't be real. They're not. Are they, would they or would they

95
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:49,355
Speaker 5:  wouldn't, would they? And then they're like, oh my God, they did. And so

96
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,475
Speaker 5:  now they're starting to fight back and there are real legal tests and the

97
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:56,195
Speaker 5:  question of how far this Doge group is actually going to be allowed to go

98
00:05:56,375 --> 00:06:00,275
Speaker 5:  and what they're going to be allowed to do, I think anyone telling

99
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:03,915
Speaker 5:  you they know the answer to that is lying to you. But right now it feels

100
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:08,035
Speaker 5:  bad. But in a complicated and hard to fully wrap your head around way,

101
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,635
Speaker 5:  which I think in a lot of ways is the point.

102
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:13,875
Speaker 4:  Right? And there's also what I would call a bunch of fake transparency in

103
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:17,475
Speaker 4:  the mix because the transparency is real, but the

104
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:21,355
Speaker 4:  purposes are, are fake or misleading. So, you know, they,

105
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:25,315
Speaker 4:  they tore down this agency, U-S-A-I-D-U-S-A, which is an agency

106
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:28,955
Speaker 4:  exists by, by creation of congress in statute, it's funded by Congress.

107
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,915
Speaker 4:  The Executive ranch is not supposed to just show up and tear those things

108
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:35,875
Speaker 4:  down. It it, that's illegal. It's not illegal when the judge

109
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,155
Speaker 4:  says it's illegal. It's just illegal. Like right. They're not allowed to

110
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:43,035
Speaker 4:  do that. That's a big problem. That's a constitutional crisis all on

111
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:46,835
Speaker 4:  its own. And then right next to that is what I, what I keep thinking of is

112
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:50,795
Speaker 4:  fake transparency, which is Elon and a bunch of

113
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:54,555
Speaker 4:  right wing grifters on X are looking at a website that has

114
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:58,395
Speaker 4:  existed for a long time, also created by the government called USA

115
00:06:58,555 --> 00:07:02,385
Speaker 4:  spending.gov. It exists, it is the literally the official source

116
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:05,425
Speaker 4:  of spending in the US United States government. It's basically just a searchable

117
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:09,305
Speaker 4:  database of spending. They're looking up numbers

118
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:12,905
Speaker 4:  and recipients of government spending. They're

119
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:16,745
Speaker 4:  manipulating the date ranges in, in bizarre ways. And then claiming

120
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:20,105
Speaker 4:  things like Politico got $8 million from USAA. Right?

121
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:24,545
Speaker 4:  Which is just flatly not true. Right? Over 17

122
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:27,785
Speaker 4:  years, the government has spent a lot of money in Politico subscriptions.

123
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:33,225
Speaker 4:  But those subscriptions are for Political pro, which is their data service.

124
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:36,905
Speaker 4:  And it costs like $20,000 per year per seat because government

125
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:40,785
Speaker 4:  bureaucrats and policy professionals and lobbyists all depend on

126
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:45,105
Speaker 4:  pretty boring like gray suit data, people doing hardcore policy

127
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,305
Speaker 4:  analysis of Politico. It is not the front facing politico that's all about

128
00:07:49,305 --> 00:07:53,025
Speaker 4:  like what some senator said in the hallway right before they retired.

129
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:57,265
Speaker 4:  It's their data organization, right? Much like Bloomberg, like you know,

130
00:07:57,415 --> 00:08:00,945
Speaker 4:  like people I think are more familiar with Bloomberg than Politico Pro Bloomberg

131
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:04,865
Speaker 4:  is a very expensive terminal subscription that stockbrokers use to

132
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:08,825
Speaker 4:  chart trades. Like it's a high speed data service that fronts

133
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:13,145
Speaker 4:  a famously money losing newsroom in magazine, which is the like

134
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:16,865
Speaker 4:  media arm of the organization. Like the part of Bloomberg, and I'll just

135
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:20,305
Speaker 4:  call it Mark Erman 'cause I'm sure all of our listeners know who Mark Erman

136
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:23,945
Speaker 4:  is. Like amazing Apple Reporter gets all the scoops is there're gonna be

137
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:27,545
Speaker 4:  a new iPhone this year. Mark Erman knows that there's gonna be any

138
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:31,425
Speaker 4:  iPhone this year. That whole part of the organization, Bloomberg

139
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:35,185
Speaker 4:  Media loses money 'cause it's just brand building for the

140
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:38,865
Speaker 4:  terminal, which prints money at a huge rate. Many, many media

141
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:42,785
Speaker 4:  organizations have this kind of relationship. Politico has one of

142
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:46,745
Speaker 4:  them. So you're just like looking at what this like fake transparency.

143
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:50,745
Speaker 4:  People are like googling the word New York, they see the word New York Times

144
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:54,825
Speaker 4:  and they're adding up the numbers for everything that has gone to

145
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:58,445
Speaker 4:  anything with the word New York in the name and saying U-S-A-I-D has funded

146
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:02,365
Speaker 4:  the New York Times $47 million. This is just not true. The New York Times

147
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:05,885
Speaker 4:  is a public company. If they had one customer that was paying

148
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:09,445
Speaker 4:  $47 million a year, we could actually verify that very quickly. This would

149
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:12,685
Speaker 4:  be a, a scandal with its own, with its own shareholders,

150
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:16,405
Speaker 4:  right? But what you're getting is these like screenshots of transparency

151
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:19,765
Speaker 4:  that were not created by Doge created by another government agency that existed

152
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:23,325
Speaker 4:  forever by statute funded by Congress. And there

153
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:27,125
Speaker 4:  it's being used to propel a narrative that Doge is doing something at all

154
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:31,365
Speaker 4:  when what we do know they're doing reported by Wired,

155
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:35,645
Speaker 4:  lots of great reporting coming in Wired by the way, reported by the New York

156
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:39,325
Speaker 4:  Times, some of our own reporting. They're showing up in these

157
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:42,085
Speaker 4:  systems, they're showing up these agencies, they're setting up their own

158
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:45,845
Speaker 4:  email servers, which is very funny given the history, the contentious

159
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:47,405
Speaker 4:  history of email servers and, and Slack

160
00:09:47,405 --> 00:09:47,805
Speaker 5:  Servers

161
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:51,845
Speaker 4:  And Slack servers. They're forcing people outta their systems.

162
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:55,285
Speaker 4:  They're writing their own code to take control of the payments and they're

163
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:58,845
Speaker 4:  basically saying, oh, we realize the government runs on computers.

164
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,845
Speaker 4:  If we take over the computers, we will run the government.

165
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:07,085
Speaker 4:  Which is the most VERGE thing to say. Like, what is the government? It's

166
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:11,005
Speaker 4:  a bunch of computer systems. Yeah. That it makes sense. Like

167
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:14,405
Speaker 4:  I think intuitively to us in our newsroom, I think it

168
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:17,245
Speaker 4:  intuitively made sense to the wired newsroom, which is why they've done so

169
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:21,085
Speaker 4:  much great reporting. Like who runs the computers is really who runs

170
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:23,885
Speaker 4:  your company, who runs your country. And so

171
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:27,165
Speaker 4:  obviously Elon Musk knows this as well. So he showed up and took control

172
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:30,165
Speaker 4:  of the computer. So now question is can he do that? Is he allowed to do that?

173
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:33,565
Speaker 4:  Can anyone stop him? Do any of these people even know

174
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:37,765
Speaker 4:  what it means to run the computers and what it means to have read only access,

175
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:41,445
Speaker 4:  which is a real, real DOGE of terminology, right?

176
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:45,765
Speaker 4:  If you all, If you have read only access, but you are in

177
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:48,605
Speaker 4:  charge of someone has right access, it doesn't matter

178
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:53,125
Speaker 4:  Right. What your individual permissions are. So there's, I think there's

179
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,885
Speaker 4:  a lot of moves here that I think are confusing, but it boils down to like

180
00:10:56,925 --> 00:11:00,285
Speaker 4:  a very VERGE idea, which is yeah, If you run the computers,

181
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:04,765
Speaker 4:  you actually run the thing. But pretty simply, and I don't think a lot of

182
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:08,045
Speaker 4:  elected officials realize that the country is just a bunch of computers.

183
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:12,125
Speaker 5:  It's a bunch of computers that are operated by people

184
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,485
Speaker 5:  who have and would like to keep having their jobs. Yeah. Right? Like over

185
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:20,005
Speaker 5:  and over and over. The, some of the pushback on this has been like, well,

186
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:22,125
Speaker 5:  why aren't the people in these jobs doing anything about it? They're just,

187
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,485
Speaker 5:  they're just bureaucrats. Why aren't they stopping them? It's like, what?

188
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,895
Speaker 5:  'cause they can't, because Elon Musk rolls in and is like, you're fired and

189
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,935
Speaker 5:  I'm going to tweet to 200 million people your

190
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:37,615
Speaker 5:  name and information. And that turns out to be pretty

191
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:41,695
Speaker 5:  threatening to a lot of people If you do that.

192
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:45,055
Speaker 5:  And so it's, it's become this thing where this, this tiny group of people

193
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:49,015
Speaker 5:  is like, it, it is just wild to me how far we got

194
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:52,335
Speaker 5:  by everybody just assuming like something like this wouldn't happen.

195
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:57,245
Speaker 5:  It's like, like Dan Hanh who worked for the federal government as a longtime

196
00:11:57,245 --> 00:12:00,925
Speaker 5:  tech guy, had a whole big long thread on Blue Sky, I think

197
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:03,885
Speaker 5:  yesterday talking about this stuff. And, and he just kept coming back to

198
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:07,605
Speaker 5:  this point that this is like fundamentally, it, it is people sitting in front

199
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:11,325
Speaker 5:  of computers and people can be e easily

200
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:15,605
Speaker 5:  told what to do because people have like jobs and needs and things

201
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:18,485
Speaker 5:  to do. And it's very easy when you're standing over somebody's shoulder to

202
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:22,605
Speaker 5:  convince them to do what you want. But also If you just come

203
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:25,805
Speaker 5:  in and are not afraid of breaking the technology, you can do pretty much

204
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:30,005
Speaker 5:  anything, right? We have the, all of these like very old brittle computing

205
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:33,765
Speaker 5:  systems that touch like hundreds of millions of people. And so

206
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:38,675
Speaker 5:  people like things don't change and, and everybody gets very mad about government

207
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,915
Speaker 5:  websites, but If you come in and you're just like, screw all of this, we're

208
00:12:41,915 --> 00:12:44,395
Speaker 5:  just taking it over, we're gonna blow it up. It turns out you have pretty

209
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:47,555
Speaker 5:  quick like unilateral authority to do just about anything.

210
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:51,675
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Actually, Senator Wyden, it's not out yet. You're people

211
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:54,635
Speaker 4:  will be listening to this over the weekend. The decoder interview with Senator

212
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:58,395
Speaker 4:  Wyden will come out on Monday. We ran the, it's a coup clip

213
00:12:58,415 --> 00:13:02,155
Speaker 4:  on TikTok. It felt important to get out to the senator

214
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:05,275
Speaker 4:  thinks it's a coup, you know, we just like ran it early. But inside of that

215
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:09,195
Speaker 4:  conversation, which again will come out on Monday, he says, no

216
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:12,435
Speaker 4:  one thought anyone would go attack the treasury system in this way. Right?

217
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:15,355
Speaker 4:  And I, that's, that's one of those things where it's like, yeah, because

218
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:19,155
Speaker 4:  it's so illegal. Like it's, it's so illegal

219
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:22,875
Speaker 4:  to send in the unelected 25 year olds

220
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:27,885
Speaker 4:  into the treasury system to fire the people who say they shouldn't have

221
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:31,685
Speaker 4:  access to it or put them on leave and then give them access to it.

222
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,285
Speaker 4:  Prompting a number of court cases. U

223
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:39,445
Speaker 4:  usually you don't do that usually. And this, by the way, is in even inside

224
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:42,985
Speaker 4:  of like the Doge framework, right? The, the

225
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,825
Speaker 4:  Vivek Ramas Swami versus Elon and Vivek gets pushed out

226
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:50,965
Speaker 4:  even inside of their own narrative. This is the tension

227
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:55,405
Speaker 4:  because Vivek is on record saying I wanted to do it

228
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:59,165
Speaker 4:  through legal means, and Elon wanted to do it through

229
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:02,285
Speaker 4:  technical means. And it's like, oh yeah, brute forcing

230
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:06,925
Speaker 4:  a computer takeover is vastly more efficient than doing it

231
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:07,925
Speaker 4:  through the legal process.

232
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:12,245
Speaker 5:  Well, and I, I mean I think this, this is where the specific

233
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:15,405
Speaker 5:  person that is Elon Musk becomes so interesting. And this was the, the thing

234
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:18,045
Speaker 5:  that Liz Lipato on our team wrote a really great piece about this week, which

235
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:21,635
Speaker 5:  is essentially Elon Musk has a pretty

236
00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:26,075
Speaker 5:  broad swath of evidence now that suggests that the rules don't exist.

237
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:30,235
Speaker 5:  And in fact, he can do whatever he wants. And he is now

238
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:33,755
Speaker 5:  in this position where like the, the president has appointed him to this

239
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:37,315
Speaker 5:  role and there's no evidence to suggest that he is going to

240
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:41,795
Speaker 5:  be stopped from doing this. And also Elon Musk just has done whatever

241
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:45,035
Speaker 5:  he wants for a really long time and like it mostly works out for him. And

242
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:47,995
Speaker 5:  so you have this combination of this like specific opportunity and this specific

243
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:51,725
Speaker 5:  person who is like, I am more or less invincible

244
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:55,565
Speaker 5:  in every sort of meaningful way and this is what happens.

245
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:59,055
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Two more things on this, then we should move on to terrorist, which

246
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:02,135
Speaker 4:  are much more sort of immediately impactful in people's lives.

247
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:06,215
Speaker 4:  The constitution of getting run run over is a big deal. I don't want to de,

248
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:10,215
Speaker 4:  I don't wanna minimize that in any way, but you can't buy mechanical

249
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,945
Speaker 4:  keyboards. I think for virtue readers much more immediately impactful. That's

250
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:16,825
Speaker 4:  just life. Like I, yeah, that's the way it goes. But two more things on this

251
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:17,705
Speaker 4:  before we talk about tariffs.

252
00:15:19,645 --> 00:15:23,425
Speaker 4:  One, there's a lot of just sort of general chatter about wired

253
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:27,185
Speaker 4:  naming the 20 somethings and teenagers who are working for Doge.

254
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,785
Speaker 4:  And a lot of it is, I think mistaken, the mistaken

255
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:35,755
Speaker 4:  sense that there's just pure criticism of of their age, right?

256
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:39,195
Speaker 4:  Young people shouldn't do stuff is like a lot of the Silicon Valley backlash

257
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:42,645
Speaker 4:  to why you're naming these people and their ages. That's not it. It's

258
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:47,335
Speaker 4:  when you're that young and then you're given the keys to the trillion dollar

259
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:51,055
Speaker 4:  treasury payment system, people are going to worry about whether you have

260
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:54,135
Speaker 4:  the expertise and knowledge to operate it correctly, especially when it's

261
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:56,975
Speaker 4:  running. It's written in cobol, like an ancient programming language,

262
00:15:57,235 --> 00:16:01,095
Speaker 5:  But also like whoever you are, we should know your

263
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:04,415
Speaker 5:  name. Like I don't, I don't care how old you are or what where you come from

264
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:08,135
Speaker 5:  or what you do professionally. Like If you have the keys

265
00:16:08,355 --> 00:16:11,295
Speaker 5:  to the federal budget, I should know your name.

266
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:14,975
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And that's the second part, right? Which is people are saying it's

267
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:18,935
Speaker 4:  doxing to know. No, they're now they're government employees. Yeah. And that

268
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:22,575
Speaker 4:  is life. And Elon loves naming government employees and directing

269
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:25,615
Speaker 4:  harassment at them has done it several times, has bullied

270
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:29,855
Speaker 4:  government employees out of their jobs with internet harassment, including

271
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:34,055
Speaker 4:  the former FAA administrator Wild, right? So

272
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:37,975
Speaker 4:  like there's a double standard here, which is the most Elon Musk thing of

273
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:41,935
Speaker 4:  all, where whatever he does is fine and, and just, and lawful and righteous.

274
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:45,215
Speaker 4:  And whenever anyone else does the same things, it's illegal. And he literally

275
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:48,415
Speaker 4:  is out there saying, this is a crime, Mr. Free sweet's absolutist is saying,

276
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:51,735
Speaker 4:  naming government employees as a crime is ridiculous.

277
00:16:52,935 --> 00:16:55,855
Speaker 4:  I, if you've been listening to the show, you know, I'm on red alert about

278
00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:58,215
Speaker 4:  the First Amendment. We're gonna come to that later in our Brendan Carr is

279
00:16:58,215 --> 00:16:58,695
Speaker 4:  a dummy segment.

280
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:04,095
Speaker 4:  But just that's like, it's the most important

281
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:07,615
Speaker 4:  thing here is there's a pressure on just transparency and

282
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:11,375
Speaker 4:  accountability for these guys to make that seem unlawful

283
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:15,215
Speaker 4:  or illegal. And that is the most important thing. Like that's how the

284
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:19,095
Speaker 4:  government works. It, it's based layer, like the American

285
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:21,855
Speaker 4:  government is supposed to be transparent and accountable people. That's why

286
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:25,735
Speaker 4:  there is a website called USA spending.gov. And so when you

287
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:29,335
Speaker 4:  see people tweeting information that was already public and

288
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:32,975
Speaker 4:  pretending it was a secret, you should immediately

289
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:37,055
Speaker 4:  distrust that person. Like, that information has been available for a long

290
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:40,975
Speaker 4:  time and and saying, I'm revealing it now, or it leaked now. Or Elon made

291
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:43,055
Speaker 4:  it transparent now, especially when you see a screenshot of that website

292
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:46,455
Speaker 4:  in particular, that's how you know they're grifting you. And like X is

293
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:50,125
Speaker 4:  particularly platform for Grifters and it's okay to know the names of people

294
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:53,685
Speaker 4:  and be worried that 19 year olds who have signed up

295
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:58,285
Speaker 4:  to scrub the all menus of DEI from government websites might be

296
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:02,045
Speaker 4:  compromised in some way is pretty normal. Like

297
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:05,965
Speaker 4:  the young men who want to get rid of racism on

298
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:09,525
Speaker 4:  websites, they come from a, a stock of young men.

299
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:13,285
Speaker 4:  And historically movements are built around that kind of feeling. It's okay

300
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:17,045
Speaker 4:  to say young men doing that is problematic for a variety of reasons.

301
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:21,365
Speaker 4:  I'm just saying. Okay, so that's Doge, we're gonna do more reporting on it.

302
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:24,765
Speaker 4:  We have a lot of ideas about how, how to report on that stuff.

303
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:28,965
Speaker 4:  Again, it's a computer takeover. It's in our zone, it's in Wired Zone, it's

304
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:32,045
Speaker 4:  in 4 0 4 zone. They've done a lot of good reporting on this as well. So we're

305
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:36,025
Speaker 4:  gonna stay focused on that. It's funny, this show comes out on

306
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:39,505
Speaker 4:  a Friday and I know by Monday something else will have happened, but oh yeah,

307
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:42,985
Speaker 4:  we'll stay focused on it. Then there's the other thing that happens

308
00:18:42,985 --> 00:18:46,305
Speaker 4:  simultaneously. This pretty much rocked the tech world, although

309
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:51,385
Speaker 4:  not as publicly as Doge, and that's tariffs. And I think

310
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:55,345
Speaker 4:  there's the sense that Trump is doing a trade war for

311
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:59,345
Speaker 4:  fun while Elon does a coup. You know, like they just hand him stacks of paper

312
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:03,025
Speaker 4:  to sign and he's having a good time while Elon does a coup. But the

313
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:06,985
Speaker 4:  tariffs are real, even though the Mexico and Canada tariffs came and

314
00:19:06,985 --> 00:19:10,705
Speaker 4:  they got delayed for 30 days. The tariffs on China really did hit,

315
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:15,215
Speaker 4:  and the di minis exception, the trade exception for packages under $800

316
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:19,015
Speaker 4:  really did hit. And it seems David, like the world of e-commerce is about

317
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:20,735
Speaker 4:  to change dramatically.

318
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:25,375
Speaker 5:  I agree. But we should, we should back up and explain what's actually happened

319
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:29,295
Speaker 5:  here. Because going back through and and putting all of this together, I

320
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:33,055
Speaker 5:  was struck by how many like twists and

321
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:36,975
Speaker 5:  reverse, like reverse Uno cards have been played over the last several days.

322
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:41,575
Speaker 5:  Richard, have you been tracking this closely? Can you Yes. Can you like

323
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:43,095
Speaker 5:  walk us through the timeline a little bit?

324
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:47,855
Speaker 6:  Okay, so Trump promised tariffs, of course throughout much of his

325
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:50,935
Speaker 6:  campaign. He started a trade war when he was president before,

326
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:54,415
Speaker 6:  unsurprisingly he wanted to do it again, wanted to do it very quickly, said

327
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:58,295
Speaker 6:  that he would, and we have been kind of waiting, we were waiting as,

328
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:02,215
Speaker 6:  as soon as his administration started, he then said that he

329
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:05,495
Speaker 6:  was going to establish these tariffs against Canada and Mexico and China

330
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:09,315
Speaker 6:  and blamed it on fentanyl for some

331
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:13,195
Speaker 6:  reason, that that's what he's got. And then Canada and

332
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:17,155
Speaker 6:  Mexico said, okay, by the way, we've announced some things already that we

333
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:20,795
Speaker 6:  were doing to stop the fentanyl trade. How about that? And he said, cool.

334
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:25,075
Speaker 6:  And did not tariff them. And, and maybe some small

335
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:29,275
Speaker 6:  things around the edges that are, that are new or, or may be negotiated.

336
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,435
Speaker 6:  So those are our pause for 30 days. However, he did not pause the changes

337
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:35,515
Speaker 6:  that were coming to the tariffs on China, which included a 10%

338
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:40,075
Speaker 6:  tariff, also included instituting previously

339
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,315
Speaker 6:  suspended tariffs. So it's, it's more than 10%. It kind of adds up and

340
00:20:44,315 --> 00:20:47,780
Speaker 6:  stacks up. And in addition, as, as you noted this di minimis

341
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:51,645
Speaker 6:  rule that maybe none of us have ever thought about, but if you've ever ordered

342
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:55,205
Speaker 6:  things on Temu or or wherever where they shipped them

343
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:59,125
Speaker 6:  directly from China to the United States, there was kind of a loophole that

344
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:02,965
Speaker 6:  avoided these fees and now that's gone. So those prices are about to

345
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:06,485
Speaker 6:  change drastically in a lot of ways. Shipping

346
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:10,405
Speaker 6:  products from China to the US is changing a lot of ways

347
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:14,165
Speaker 6:  very rapidly. The USPS did not know what was going on on Wednesday,

348
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:18,365
Speaker 6:  stopped everything, then unstopped everything. And now we, we just

349
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:21,325
Speaker 6:  we're, we're kind of waiting to see how much the prices go up. It does

350
00:21:21,325 --> 00:21:25,085
Speaker 5:  Seem like right now the confusion is the thing,

351
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,525
Speaker 5:  and I don't know if this was deliberate or not, but this all happened so

352
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:31,525
Speaker 5:  fast. Everybody was waiting for there to be tariffs, like you said, Richard.

353
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,485
Speaker 5:  And then the prevailing theory for a long time

354
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:39,285
Speaker 5:  among like economists and stuff was basically like Trump wouldn't possibly

355
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:42,965
Speaker 5:  do that. It's, it's ridiculous. Tariffs are self-defeating. Everybody

356
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:46,845
Speaker 5:  agrees. Tariffs actually help. No one, there is no point in

357
00:21:46,845 --> 00:21:50,565
Speaker 5:  this. He won't do it. And then he did it

358
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:55,125
Speaker 5:  very quickly and in a different way than anybody expected. And

359
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,325
Speaker 5:  so all of a sudden everybody is just thrown into chaos. Like you're saying,

360
00:21:58,325 --> 00:22:02,005
Speaker 5:  like the Nila you mentioned the story of this keyboard manufacturer, this

361
00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:05,245
Speaker 5:  company called K Keys that basically just like

362
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:09,685
Speaker 5:  got the news called up DHL and was like, what are we doing? And

363
00:22:09,885 --> 00:22:13,685
Speaker 5:  DHL was like, okay, you're gonna need, I think it was 50% of the

364
00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:17,485
Speaker 5:  purchase price as a customs deposit. And then there's going to be

365
00:22:17,765 --> 00:22:21,525
Speaker 5:  a huge new fee as this stuff gets imported into the US

366
00:22:21,985 --> 00:22:25,285
Speaker 5:  And the, the company was essentially like, all right, we're just gonna stop

367
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:28,725
Speaker 5:  shipping while we figure this out. Like, nobody knows what to do with this.

368
00:22:28,835 --> 00:22:32,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And so, so so much of

369
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:36,905
Speaker 5:  what we do and the stuff that we buy and the stuff that we get is

370
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:40,785
Speaker 5:  going to be caught up in this confusion. And I think it, it's,

371
00:22:40,815 --> 00:22:43,985
Speaker 5:  it's a going to get more expensive. That's gonna get messy. And like, again,

372
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:46,665
Speaker 5:  there are lots of economists who have gamed this out and pretty much everybody

373
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:50,625
Speaker 5:  who thinks about this stuff agrees that tariffs are pointless. And we can

374
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:53,265
Speaker 5:  get into why if we want to, but the very first thing that's going to happen

375
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:56,745
Speaker 5:  is a bunch of your stuff is gonna get more expensive. But I think at the

376
00:22:56,905 --> 00:23:00,745
Speaker 5:  same time, stuff is just going to stop appearing because

377
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:04,385
Speaker 5:  there are just going to be a lot of companies and drop shippers and whoever

378
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:07,825
Speaker 5:  who just decide the smart thing to do in this moment is just nothing.

379
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:11,945
Speaker 5:  Because there is a sense that even what's happening now is impermanent and

380
00:23:11,945 --> 00:23:15,825
Speaker 5:  will change. And the, the back and forth with Mexico and Canada has

381
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,825
Speaker 5:  already taught a lot of people that maybe if I just wait this out. So like

382
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:21,745
Speaker 5:  I think this idea of like, we're just gonna stop shipping for a minute until

383
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:25,705
Speaker 5:  we figure out what's going on might become more pervasive pretty quickly.

384
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:29,625
Speaker 5:  I don't think that's true of like Apple, which has like gigantic teams of

385
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:33,545
Speaker 5:  people who do this for a living, but like the, the Sheens and Timus of

386
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,585
Speaker 5:  the world that that all that stuff is gonna just start to

387
00:23:37,645 --> 00:23:41,545
Speaker 5:  wither away both because it's just more expensive and it's just more

388
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,745
Speaker 5:  complicated. So

389
00:23:42,945 --> 00:23:43,465
Speaker 6:  I I'm

390
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:44,505
Speaker 5:  I'm curious about that.

391
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:49,845
Speaker 4:  She and Timo are built on this regulatory exception. They've built entire

392
00:23:50,165 --> 00:23:53,885
Speaker 4:  businesses in this country on the back of the de minimis exception,

393
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:54,325
Speaker 4:  which

394
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:58,205
Speaker 5:  Is $800, right? If it's eight, $800, it escapes the customs fees essentially.

395
00:23:58,205 --> 00:23:58,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

396
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:01,365
Speaker 4:  You don't have to go through customs inspection, you don't have to pay extra

397
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:04,565
Speaker 4:  fees. What you just send the package over and here you go. I've bought, I

398
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:07,365
Speaker 5:  Didn't know about this and I'm struck by thinking $800 is kind of a lot of

399
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:09,725
Speaker 5:  money. That's a, that's a lot of stuff that would get

400
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:11,525
Speaker 4:  Under eight. It's just for a great hall video.

401
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:16,765
Speaker 4:  Like you live in a, in an economy, in an

402
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:20,405
Speaker 4:  information ecosystem that is built around $800 limits

403
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:24,745
Speaker 4:  on customs inspections. That's the size of a she and all

404
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:25,305
Speaker 5:  It's

405
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:28,865
Speaker 4:  Real. Like that's, it's so real. It's, it's, it, it's

406
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:32,345
Speaker 4:  everywhere. I've bought stuff on these sites

407
00:24:33,045 --> 00:24:36,585
Speaker 4:  and they come direct from China and it's just wild, right? That you get a

408
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:38,865
Speaker 4:  package directly from China, you haven't paid any customs. And now we're

409
00:24:38,865 --> 00:24:42,785
Speaker 4:  in a situation where I have seen people who are

410
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:46,665
Speaker 4:  like the drop shippers want my social security number so that

411
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:49,705
Speaker 4:  the custom service has accountability. 'cause they have required a social

412
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:53,425
Speaker 4:  security number for a shipper on this end. That's just, I mean, that's the

413
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,345
Speaker 4:  end of these if that's really the rule. And again, the uncertainty is the

414
00:24:56,345 --> 00:25:00,145
Speaker 4:  point. If that's really the outcome, like these companies definitely go away.

415
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:04,105
Speaker 4:  I don't know that it will definitely be the outcome. There are, they obviously

416
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:08,025
Speaker 4:  have built large companies around a weird regulatory loophole

417
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:11,345
Speaker 4:  that could have been closed at any time. And certainly the Biden administration,

418
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:13,985
Speaker 4:  even the the first Trump administration people talked about closing this

419
00:25:13,985 --> 00:25:17,825
Speaker 4:  loophole there. They might find a way around it, but all of those ways

420
00:25:18,065 --> 00:25:21,505
Speaker 4:  will increase cost. Where it's really gonna hit is a bunch of small companies,

421
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:25,785
Speaker 4:  right, who don't have big compliance offices like Apple, who

422
00:25:26,355 --> 00:25:28,945
Speaker 4:  don't know what to do and are just gonna say, we're just pausing shipments

423
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:32,505
Speaker 4:  until something gets resolved. Right? I have this thing called the to shine

424
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:35,545
Speaker 4:  in my house. I love it. It's one of my favorite little gadgets. It's just

425
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:39,385
Speaker 4:  a super low res, like LLED

426
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:43,265
Speaker 4:  display that you connect to whatever streaming service and it displays album

427
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:43,625
Speaker 4:  art.

428
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:44,745
Speaker 5:  Oh, I've seen this thing. Cool.

429
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:45,465
Speaker 4:  It's like ultra pixelated.

430
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:48,345
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's like a light bright for album art. It's pretty cool. It's a light

431
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:51,705
Speaker 4:  Bright for album. Yeah, it's su it's super fun. I have been meaning to write

432
00:25:51,705 --> 00:25:55,345
Speaker 4:  about forever. I actually asked to buy a s butler that it's one guy

433
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:59,385
Speaker 4:  who quit his tech job to build these things in his spare time. I love

434
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:02,065
Speaker 4:  this. I should have written about it ages ago, but I asked him a while ago,

435
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:05,945
Speaker 4:  how will tariffs hit you? And he basically said, I would love

436
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:09,625
Speaker 4:  to switch to more US made parts, but the quotes I've gotten in the past are

437
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:13,585
Speaker 4:  300 to 400% higher Wow. Than what I pay now

438
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:16,985
Speaker 4:  from Chinese to get Chinese parts. And a few of the parts don't get made

439
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:20,815
Speaker 4:  anywhere but China. So like this little company, just a guy who quit his

440
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:24,775
Speaker 4:  job to like build, build album art light brights, he is like, my parts are

441
00:26:24,775 --> 00:26:28,495
Speaker 4:  gonna go up 300, 400%. And then he says, I could also

442
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:32,855
Speaker 4:  increase production by 20 to a hundred times of

443
00:26:32,935 --> 00:26:36,815
Speaker 4:  what he makes. Now he makes 'em all by hand, so that's hard. But in order

444
00:26:36,815 --> 00:26:40,655
Speaker 4:  to do that, I would've to pay $200,000 upfront. So

445
00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:44,485
Speaker 4:  he just has to write a $200,000 check in order to front the increase

446
00:26:44,485 --> 00:26:45,485
Speaker 4:  in production that would cover his

447
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:48,085
Speaker 5:  Tariffs. What you just described is the difference between being in business

448
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:49,525
Speaker 5:  and being out of business. Right.

449
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:49,885
Speaker 4:  And then he

450
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:50,805
Speaker 5:  Like, it's, it's that simple.

451
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:53,525
Speaker 4:  I'll, and I'll, I'll run, I'll, I will actually put this in a story I've

452
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:56,325
Speaker 4:  been meaning to follow with Tobias now that there's this actual tariff. I

453
00:26:56,325 --> 00:27:00,085
Speaker 4:  emailed him before and so I, I promise I'll publish this story.

454
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:03,205
Speaker 4:  I'm assigning myself this own my own story because I do love my tunes shine.

455
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:06,405
Speaker 4:  But he's, he handed his note to me by saying I'm hopeful that a big company

456
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:09,765
Speaker 4:  like Apple will have enough sway in the administration to point out how much

457
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:12,525
Speaker 4:  more expensive so many products will get overnight and prevent tariffs from

458
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:16,245
Speaker 4:  going into place. Here we are. Like they're in place.

459
00:27:16,245 --> 00:27:20,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like this ecosystem is already under pressure. The little

460
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:23,965
Speaker 4:  companies are already feeling it or will already feel it. And the big companies

461
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:27,365
Speaker 4:  like Apple are staring down a barrel of, oh, are we gonna have to just

462
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:31,725
Speaker 4:  increase iPhone prices by 10%? Because Apple

463
00:27:31,825 --> 00:27:35,685
Speaker 4:  is very capable of just subtly increasing prices in September to cover the

464
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:39,645
Speaker 4:  bill, right? Yeah. And they might just do it or they might increase iCloud

465
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:43,485
Speaker 4:  prices. Hey, you know, like it's you, you're at five gigs of iCloud storage,

466
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:47,245
Speaker 4:  like now it's $8 instead of seven. Like they can make these moves

467
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:51,765
Speaker 4:  to eat it or they can do what we have always seen Tim Cook do.

468
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:55,845
Speaker 4:  They can buy themselves a tariff waiver, which he has done several times

469
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:59,285
Speaker 4:  in the past. The problem is this time Trump is threatening

470
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:03,565
Speaker 4:  tariffs on chips from Taiwan. He's threatening tariffs on the

471
00:28:03,805 --> 00:28:07,645
Speaker 4:  eu, which apple's in a fight with the, the political dimension of this is,

472
00:28:07,665 --> 00:28:10,645
Speaker 4:  is actually much more complicated for Tim Cook to navigate. And I have no

473
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:11,405
Speaker 4:  idea what he's gonna do.

474
00:28:11,795 --> 00:28:15,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I I'm sort of at the point where I don't know how to handicap that

475
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:19,365
Speaker 5:  either. But I also think if you're Apple, you can afford to do

476
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:23,285
Speaker 5:  all those things you just described, right? Like the idea of iCloud

477
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:27,245
Speaker 5:  prices going up a dollar and, and, and that pays for all of this is

478
00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:31,205
Speaker 5:  like real, like that's, that's a, those are moves Apple has, those are

479
00:28:31,265 --> 00:28:35,245
Speaker 5:  not moves most companies have. Like this all just rhymes to me of

480
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:38,325
Speaker 5:  like the zero interest rate phenomenon stuff we've been talking about that

481
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:42,085
Speaker 5:  there was all this stuff that was possible when everything was

482
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:45,245
Speaker 5:  cheap and everybody had more access to more money all the time. And then

483
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:49,165
Speaker 5:  as soon as that went away, all these companies who were operating at a loss

484
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:52,085
Speaker 5:  based on being able to get more investment or were making these like teeny

485
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:55,845
Speaker 5:  tiny margins die, like those companies are gone.

486
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:59,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Because money stopped being free and, and it's like people

487
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:03,325
Speaker 5:  underestimate how big a change everything is now

488
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:06,685
Speaker 5:  10% more expensive to customers is because

489
00:29:07,235 --> 00:29:11,205
Speaker 5:  it's not as simple as you ship a finished product to a person and it charges

490
00:29:11,235 --> 00:29:14,965
Speaker 5:  them 10% more. And that even if it were that, that's problematic.

491
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:18,765
Speaker 5:  But the way a trade works, it everything moves in so many directions all

492
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:22,525
Speaker 5:  the time that this stuff is just going to cost

493
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:26,005
Speaker 5:  more than you think. Every one of these is going to be more expensive than

494
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:27,605
Speaker 5:  you think. And Richard, like you're talking about this stuff is starting

495
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:31,525
Speaker 5:  to stack. And so we're getting to the point where so many of these

496
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:34,565
Speaker 5:  tariffs for big companies are gonna be like a big

497
00:29:35,355 --> 00:29:38,245
Speaker 5:  quarterly earnings headache. And like, if I'm being completely honest, I

498
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:41,400
Speaker 5:  don't worry existentially for like Apple and Google's ability, ability to

499
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,925
Speaker 5:  weather tariffs, like they'll be fine. It'll be more expensive for us and

500
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:48,605
Speaker 5:  that will suck. But there's, there's a whole huge

501
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:51,805
Speaker 5:  slew, like if you're a hardware startup right now, your host

502
00:29:52,585 --> 00:29:56,435
Speaker 5:  like this, this is an existential crisis for anyone in that position right

503
00:29:56,435 --> 00:29:57,395
Speaker 5:  now. And that sucks.

504
00:29:58,335 --> 00:30:01,635
Speaker 6:  And that's the thing, like these companies that make these devices that aren't

505
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:05,235
Speaker 6:  in huge numbers that aren't in Apple production, that rely on maybe

506
00:30:05,635 --> 00:30:08,995
Speaker 6:  contract production or, you know, they're go, they're going on some website

507
00:30:08,995 --> 00:30:12,895
Speaker 6:  just to find components the same as you and I can, they just

508
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:16,695
Speaker 6:  suddenly don't exist. Like you get to a point where as, as you said, they

509
00:30:16,695 --> 00:30:20,605
Speaker 6:  just stop existing and you, you can't, you can't get around

510
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:23,925
Speaker 6:  that. And that, and what that means is that even if the tariffs were repealed

511
00:30:24,025 --> 00:30:27,285
Speaker 6:  the day after, those companies don't just come back into existence. Like

512
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:28,845
Speaker 6:  it does, it does not work that way. Right.

513
00:30:29,105 --> 00:30:32,645
Speaker 5:  And of course all these other countries have moves to like,

514
00:30:33,385 --> 00:30:36,805
Speaker 5:  you know, Canada immediately launched retaliatory tariffs. Mexico said it

515
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:40,645
Speaker 5:  was gonna do stuff. China is now like antitrust investigating Google,

516
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:41,805
Speaker 5:  which is hysterical.

517
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:44,485
Speaker 4:  That's actually the funniest one of these all like Google doesn't operate

518
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:46,445
Speaker 4:  there weird. You know,

519
00:30:46,565 --> 00:30:50,525
Speaker 5:  Like, yeah. Like Google has a monopoly in China despite not

520
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:51,605
Speaker 5:  existing is like, oh, so

521
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:55,325
Speaker 4:  Google does have offices there, they have some like AI researchers

522
00:30:55,525 --> 00:30:59,405
Speaker 4:  there, but they don't have any products there. What they have is Android,

523
00:30:59,415 --> 00:31:03,325
Speaker 4:  which is forked by Chinese phone makers into whatever custom version of

524
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:06,525
Speaker 4:  Android they all wanna run. I don't know that's a monopoly. It is just very

525
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:10,325
Speaker 4:  funny that they were like, ah, Google, there was a report today that they

526
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:14,205
Speaker 4:  might start investigating Apple's app store fees. And that's the big

527
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:18,125
Speaker 4:  retaliation. And that is also the danger for the eu, right? The

528
00:31:18,285 --> 00:31:22,125
Speaker 4:  EU famously loves to regulate Apple. They're like, make the icons blue and

529
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:25,845
Speaker 4:  apple's like, I hate you. And that's a very challenging relationship. And

530
00:31:25,845 --> 00:31:29,325
Speaker 4:  we've heard from Apple in various ways that one of the reasons that,

531
00:31:29,745 --> 00:31:32,365
Speaker 4:  you know, Tim Cook called Trump before the inauguration, all this stuff was

532
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:36,045
Speaker 4:  to warm up that relationship so that he might fight EU

533
00:31:36,045 --> 00:31:39,485
Speaker 4:  regulation. Mark Zuckerberg has openly said, yep, he would like Trump to

534
00:31:39,725 --> 00:31:42,445
Speaker 4:  advocate for American companies in the face of EU regulation. Trump has said

535
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:46,405
Speaker 4:  he'll put tariffs in the EU if the EU responds to those tariffs by

536
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,565
Speaker 4:  saying, no, we're gonna do more investigations, actually we're gonna turn

537
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:53,325
Speaker 4:  up the heat on American companies. Like I don't know that this actually

538
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:57,005
Speaker 4:  solves the problem. I don't know that this begets in negotiation. I think

539
00:31:57,005 --> 00:32:00,845
Speaker 4:  it just gets more and more tense until something breaks in a way

540
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:02,245
Speaker 4:  that maybe never goes back together.

541
00:32:02,595 --> 00:32:06,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean it, it, it certainly seems like we are more likely to

542
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:10,445
Speaker 5:  be headed in that direction than everyone just caves and gives

543
00:32:11,345 --> 00:32:14,925
Speaker 5:  the Trump administration something fair. It's not super clear

544
00:32:14,925 --> 00:32:15,085
Speaker 4:  To me

545
00:32:15,315 --> 00:32:16,445
Speaker 5:  Victory looks like even

546
00:32:16,445 --> 00:32:19,925
Speaker 4:  Mean to on tariffs. The Trump administration has caved like immediately caved

547
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:23,725
Speaker 4:  Well, yeah, right to Mexico, China. But in, you know, it's a 30 day pause

548
00:32:24,105 --> 00:32:28,085
Speaker 4:  the same way the TikTok ban was a 75 day pause. And at the scale

549
00:32:28,265 --> 00:32:31,725
Speaker 4:  of these companies and the scale of global trade and the scale of tech industry,

550
00:32:32,545 --> 00:32:36,525
Speaker 4:  you cannot run these things in these weird liminal states

551
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:40,765
Speaker 4:  between yes and no. You should not operate a business the size of TikTok

552
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,985
Speaker 4:  in a 70 day pause of being illegal. Like

553
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:48,945
Speaker 4:  that's not the way to go. You're not like, well it's illegal to sell drugs,

554
00:32:49,245 --> 00:32:53,225
Speaker 4:  but for 75 more days, we're doing the purge. Like that doesn't make any sense.

555
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:57,705
Speaker 4:  Like these companies have people there who like, have families and

556
00:32:57,985 --> 00:33:01,945
Speaker 4:  mortgages and jobs and careers and you, you can't be like, well

557
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:06,225
Speaker 4:  for 30 more days you're off the hook. The American automotive

558
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:09,505
Speaker 4:  supply chain is off the hook for 30 more days and then something might happen.

559
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:13,225
Speaker 4:  And the most likely thing that happens is it gets, it gets extended for another

560
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:17,145
Speaker 4:  30 days. That's just, that's no way to do it. Like the economy

561
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:21,425
Speaker 4:  actually won't accept that amount of instability. So, we'll, we'll see,

562
00:33:21,425 --> 00:33:25,065
Speaker 4:  because that's very much the Trump way of doing things, but something is

563
00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:28,985
Speaker 4:  gonna have to give, and I, I suspect the reason big business is so in

564
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:32,345
Speaker 4:  bed with Trump is because they, they need to get to those table outcomes

565
00:33:33,005 --> 00:33:36,505
Speaker 4:  and like, no matter what they say or how disingenuous they sound in public,

566
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:40,435
Speaker 4:  they're not stupid about the money. Right. You, you can count on, you can

567
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,355
Speaker 4:  count on the money being self-serving in that, in that specific way and they

568
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,675
Speaker 4:  will demand some kind of stability.

569
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:48,675
Speaker 5:  Richard, what's your, what's your guess of what happens next here? It does

570
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:52,295
Speaker 5:  feel like we're due for another turn here fairly

571
00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:53,495
Speaker 5:  quickly with

572
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:57,185
Speaker 6:  The tariffs. I don't know because it's so complicated and I think that's

573
00:33:57,185 --> 00:34:00,985
Speaker 6:  the thing that you struggle on and how this affects Apple in particular,

574
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:04,305
Speaker 6:  for example, because they have their production in China. They have, and

575
00:34:04,305 --> 00:34:07,385
Speaker 6:  they have started to move some production into other places. But like so

576
00:34:07,385 --> 00:34:09,545
Speaker 6:  many companies, they produce so many things in China, they're such a big

577
00:34:09,905 --> 00:34:13,585
Speaker 6:  American company. All of the biggest American companies that we're talking

578
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,505
Speaker 6:  about, Nvidia, what's going to happen to their chips.

579
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:20,835
Speaker 6:  These are all, and these are also inevitably the same executives that have

580
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:24,875
Speaker 6:  tried to curry favor with Trump who wins and who

581
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:28,155
Speaker 6:  is actually in control in, in the White House. What, what does, what does

582
00:34:28,155 --> 00:34:31,275
Speaker 6:  China decide to do? China said that they're gonna sue at the w wt o which

583
00:34:31,275 --> 00:34:32,915
Speaker 6:  may or may not mean anything.

584
00:34:34,595 --> 00:34:37,235
Speaker 6:  I think, I think things are going to get worse before they get better.

585
00:34:37,465 --> 00:34:41,315
Speaker 5:  Okay. I I just wanna say one thing before we go, which is that like

586
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:44,675
Speaker 5:  a, a thing I say to you Neli all the time because I want you to like be more

587
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:48,635
Speaker 5:  outrageous in public is that you can just say things, but

588
00:34:48,635 --> 00:34:52,155
Speaker 5:  this has become like a mantra for me over the last few weeks is that you

589
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:56,035
Speaker 5:  can just say things and like people, people just say things and

590
00:34:56,075 --> 00:34:59,595
Speaker 5:  I think we are like trained to believe that people mostly

591
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:02,795
Speaker 5:  say things that are like true and considered and thoughtful and that they

592
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:06,635
Speaker 5:  believe. But you can just say things and so much of

593
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:10,435
Speaker 5:  pe what people say is just them saying things like, president Trump

594
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:14,035
Speaker 5:  was like, I have a different air traffic control

595
00:35:14,185 --> 00:35:15,715
Speaker 5:  when I fly than everybody else

596
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:18,795
Speaker 4:  Made by a foreign government made by, right? And everyone was like, Israel.

597
00:35:18,795 --> 00:35:20,115
Speaker 4:  And it's like, whatcha talking about

598
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:20,675
Speaker 5:  What

599
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:22,645
Speaker 4:  Richard?

600
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:24,725
Speaker 5:  Do you know the answer to this? Can you explain this to me? Is this a real

601
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:24,845
Speaker 5:  thing?

602
00:35:25,985 --> 00:35:28,425
Speaker 6:  I know the answer, but I can't tell you. It's, there

603
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:30,105
Speaker 4:  You go. That's

604
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:33,865
Speaker 5:  Right. You can just say things and like, I think a, a thing

605
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,125
Speaker 5:  we've talked about a lot with Elon Musk over the years, and I think we talked

606
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:41,045
Speaker 5:  about a lot during the first Trump administration was how to sort out the

607
00:35:41,045 --> 00:35:44,165
Speaker 5:  difference between somebody just saying things

608
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:49,005
Speaker 5:  and actual reality. Like I saw this great TikTok

609
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:51,725
Speaker 5:  this morning where it was like this guy sitting in like, you know, podcast

610
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:54,565
Speaker 5:  pose. He is got the microphone, he's talking into it and he's like, studies

611
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,405
Speaker 5:  say that If you get three to four hours of sleep

612
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:02,045
Speaker 5:  that actually your life expectancy goes up. And he's like, Harvard studies,

613
00:36:02,075 --> 00:36:04,725
Speaker 5:  Yale studies these whole thing and he goes through the whole thing and then

614
00:36:04,725 --> 00:36:07,605
Speaker 5:  it, the camera pulls back and he goes, put some inspirational music behind

615
00:36:07,605 --> 00:36:10,085
Speaker 5:  that. Everybody will believe it. Yeah. And it's like, shit. Everybody does

616
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:10,285
Speaker 5:  that.

617
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:11,685
Speaker 4:  Believe it. That man was Andrew Huberman.

618
00:36:12,115 --> 00:36:15,325
Speaker 5:  This is, you can just say things and I think like

619
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,965
Speaker 4:  It's, it's how much a one did you buy after you saw that?

620
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:21,765
Speaker 5:  That's what say. I haven't slept for four hours in, in months since I saw

621
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:25,685
Speaker 5:  that. But like I, again, I, I think it's so

622
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:29,565
Speaker 5:  important for us as like journalists, but also just as like people in the

623
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:33,525
Speaker 5:  world right now to spend a lot of time going, people can just say

624
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:37,005
Speaker 5:  things and most of the time that's all it is. And if all that's all it is,

625
00:36:37,005 --> 00:36:39,485
Speaker 5:  it doesn't matter at all. High stakes, low stakes,

626
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:43,325
Speaker 4:  Would I? But I would say that the, with Elon, Elon loves to just say things.

627
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,525
Speaker 4:  Remember when he was gonna build a a, a hyperloop in Chicago to the airport?

628
00:36:48,155 --> 00:36:52,015
Speaker 4:  Sure. Remember when the cars were gonna drive themselves? Yeah, yeah.

629
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:55,015
Speaker 4:  He just, he loves saying stuff, loves it. And you can't,

630
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:56,255
Speaker 5:  You can just say things and

631
00:36:56,255 --> 00:37:00,015
Speaker 4:  Usually the stakes are pretty medium. Like I think the people of Chicago

632
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:04,015
Speaker 4:  knew there would never be a hyperloop to the airport. Like I I I spent

633
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:06,535
Speaker 4:  a lot of time in that city. No one was like, they're gonna build a hyperloop

634
00:37:06,535 --> 00:37:09,255
Speaker 4:  to the airport. People were more like, we'll shoot you If you come here.

635
00:37:09,535 --> 00:37:12,535
Speaker 4:  Like, it was very different. The, the reaction was very different.

636
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:17,615
Speaker 4:  The stakes from the president says, I will build a hotel in Gaza

637
00:37:17,915 --> 00:37:20,695
Speaker 4:  and turn that into the Riviera of the Middle East. The the stakes of that

638
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:21,655
Speaker 4:  are World War iii.

639
00:37:22,435 --> 00:37:25,095
Speaker 5:  But that's the thing is I'm not sure they are because he, it's not real.

640
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:28,135
Speaker 5:  He's just saying things. You can just

641
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:30,895
Speaker 4:  Say things. They, these are the most powerful men in the world right now.

642
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:33,655
Speaker 4:  Elon is the richest man in the world. He might be in control of the government.

643
00:37:34,215 --> 00:37:37,255
Speaker 4:  President Trump nominally is the most powerful person in the world. He can

644
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,215
Speaker 4:  launch a nuclear strike if he wants to. There's a lot going on here where

645
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:44,615
Speaker 4:  I I hear you and certainly less than the first Trump administration is you

646
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:47,375
Speaker 4:  can just say things. You can just say, I'm gonna put 25% tariffs on Canada,

647
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:51,215
Speaker 4:  Mexico, and then back off two hours before they go into effect. Because

648
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:54,615
Speaker 4:  both of those governments promise to do things they're already gonna do and

649
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:58,655
Speaker 4:  everyone can adapt to that. There's just a, there's a new

650
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:02,495
Speaker 4:  level of crazy that comes with x as it is right

651
00:38:02,495 --> 00:38:06,095
Speaker 4:  now with Elon realizing that he can just say stuff about the government.

652
00:38:06,205 --> 00:38:10,095
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's what I'm worried about. Like, and then

653
00:38:10,145 --> 00:38:14,095
Speaker 4:  Trump is Trump like I, he, he is just the

654
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:17,575
Speaker 4:  most I anyone can say anything. He, he said Google was gonna make a website

655
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:21,535
Speaker 4:  to track the coronavirus. We tracked it every single day for a year and

656
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:22,015
Speaker 4:  that never happened.

657
00:38:22,115 --> 00:38:25,295
Speaker 5:  Wonder how many days? It's been thousands of days at this point.

658
00:38:26,075 --> 00:38:29,055
Speaker 4:  So yeah, we we can wrap this one up. I I I hear you. And you can just say

659
00:38:29,055 --> 00:38:31,735
Speaker 4:  things and I believe I should start saying more or just things. Do you know

660
00:38:31,735 --> 00:38:32,575
Speaker 4:  The Verge is making a phone?

661
00:38:35,715 --> 00:38:36,605
Speaker 4:  It's gonna be great. You're gonna

662
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,485
Speaker 5:  Love The Verge could make a website to track Coronavirus. I'm just

663
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:40,525
Speaker 4:  Saying we thought about it

664
00:38:42,835 --> 00:38:46,325
Speaker 4:  somehow you could get the, the bleach under the skin to just kill it. It

665
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:50,165
Speaker 4:  would be great. Our very powerful light. Do you remember

666
00:38:50,165 --> 00:38:53,165
Speaker 4:  this? This happened. We've lived through this. Some of you our greatest

667
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:56,885
Speaker 6:  Institutions are being doubted. Man, nobody believed shams when he said that

668
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:59,365
Speaker 6:  Luca was being traded. Yeah. People doubted

669
00:38:59,575 --> 00:39:02,325
Speaker 4:  Shams can just say, actually let's end it here. Richard, I I want your take

670
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:05,565
Speaker 4:  on this. Do you think Luca on the Mavs was a zero interest rate phenomenon?

671
00:39:06,785 --> 00:39:07,725
Speaker 6:  Yes. Obviously

672
00:39:09,785 --> 00:39:10,485
Speaker 4:  That's why they

673
00:39:10,485 --> 00:39:11,085
Speaker 6:  Had trade

674
00:39:11,085 --> 00:39:14,965
Speaker 4:  Him. That is a deep cut for a small cross section of our listeners, but

675
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:17,885
Speaker 4:  I know you appreciated it. We gotta take a break. It is true by the way.

676
00:39:17,885 --> 00:39:21,365
Speaker 4:  People can just say things and we will do our very best to call out when

677
00:39:21,365 --> 00:39:24,405
Speaker 4:  people just say things here. But boy, get used to it. We'll be right back.

678
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:24,845
Speaker 5:  loves it and the prices go down all the time. It's fabulous.

679
00:40:26,305 --> 00:40:29,765
Speaker 4:  All right, let's start. Let, let's start with Tubi. Can we start with Tubi?

680
00:40:29,785 --> 00:40:32,725
Speaker 5:  Wow. That is the first time. What a, what a day for Tuby. That just was,

681
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:34,445
Speaker 5:  nobody's ever said that about Tub. I'm

682
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:35,125
Speaker 4:  Excited for them.

683
00:40:35,515 --> 00:40:36,805
Speaker 6:  They've got the Super Bowl, man.

684
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:39,045
Speaker 4:  They're coming. They got the Super Bowl, the Super Bowls on Sunday,

685
00:40:40,945 --> 00:40:43,925
Speaker 4:  you know, that's exciting. Given that we, we've already seen

686
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,365
Speaker 5:  You guys watching Z Suite yet,

687
00:40:45,905 --> 00:40:46,845
Speaker 4:  What's the Z Suite?

688
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:50,005
Speaker 5:  So Z Suite is I think probably

689
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:54,125
Speaker 5:  toy's, like biggest original programming ever.

690
00:40:55,065 --> 00:40:58,965
Speaker 5:  And the shtick as I understand it, is it's a, I think it's like a marketing

691
00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:02,925
Speaker 5:  agency in New York and it all the, all the older like Gen

692
00:41:02,995 --> 00:41:06,925
Speaker 5:  Xers are forced out and the Zoomers come in to run it. And

693
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,925
Speaker 5:  so it's called the Z Suite and

694
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:13,645
Speaker 5:  it has, what's her name? Lauren Graham Lorelei from Gilmore Girls.

695
00:41:14,815 --> 00:41:15,995
Speaker 5:  I'm excited. Sure.

696
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:19,555
Speaker 4:  I would say that Cranky Gen Xers get forced out and the Zoomers come in to

697
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:23,395
Speaker 4:  run. It is both my nightmare and my dream at this point in time. Like please

698
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:26,715
Speaker 4:  depose me. I'm ready to go. Just anytime you want.

699
00:41:28,025 --> 00:41:31,035
Speaker 4:  Also bad day for Tuby when I'm like, let's talk about Tuby and I didn't know

700
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:31,875
Speaker 4:  the name of their biggest show.

701
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:35,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean listen, Richard is an aficionado, so it's fine. Richard and

702
00:41:35,685 --> 00:41:38,365
Speaker 5:  I after this are gonna record our, our Z Suite recap podcast.

703
00:41:39,075 --> 00:41:39,565
Speaker 4:  Finally.

704
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:43,765
Speaker 6:  No, I'm, I'm still on the golden arm man, real head to know.

705
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:49,155
Speaker 4:  I feel so bad that I know what the golden arm is. Dear Sweet Quibi. Okay,

706
00:41:49,295 --> 00:41:52,795
Speaker 4:  so two B is having its big moment. A lot of you have asked us,

707
00:41:53,235 --> 00:41:56,395
Speaker 4:  I think because they assume that we pay attention to badly named streaming

708
00:41:56,555 --> 00:42:00,435
Speaker 4:  services in this way. Why Tuby has a Super Bowl. And the fascinating

709
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:04,115
Speaker 4:  answer to this question is that Fox owns Tuby and they don't

710
00:42:04,145 --> 00:42:07,955
Speaker 4:  make a show of this, but we've had Tuby, CEO Angelie sued on

711
00:42:08,145 --> 00:42:12,035
Speaker 4:  decoder. She's talked about the relationship. Tuby is just there to be

712
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:15,675
Speaker 4:  like always on like it, it's just an on-demand free

713
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:19,355
Speaker 4:  streaming service. It is doing pretty well. It's growing it bundle

714
00:42:19,385 --> 00:42:23,195
Speaker 4:  with a lot of TVs and streaming devices, putting the Super Bowl there for

715
00:42:23,215 --> 00:42:26,515
Speaker 4:  Fox as a growth strategy. If you recall the last time Fox had the Super Bowl,

716
00:42:26,515 --> 00:42:28,795
Speaker 4:  Tubi had an ad because Fox owns

717
00:42:28,795 --> 00:42:31,795
Speaker 5:  Tuby. That was the one, the ad that it like popped up the interface over

718
00:42:31,795 --> 00:42:35,115
Speaker 5:  the tv, right? Yep. That was a good ad. It tricked a lot of people into being

719
00:42:35,115 --> 00:42:36,075
Speaker 5:  like, what's going on with my tv?

720
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:38,355
Speaker 6:  And that was when people found out what Tubi is.

721
00:42:38,995 --> 00:42:41,595
Speaker 5:  Exactly. It's the malware on my television.

722
00:42:42,135 --> 00:42:44,915
Speaker 4:  So this is their second big growth they're gonna give away for free. It's

723
00:42:44,915 --> 00:42:48,555
Speaker 4:  also really interesting it, because traditionally this should be a horrible

724
00:42:48,655 --> 00:42:52,475
Speaker 4:  way to advertise your service because you would be competing with the

725
00:42:52,505 --> 00:42:56,315
Speaker 4:  free television that most people already have, which is their antenna Fox

726
00:42:56,335 --> 00:43:00,285
Speaker 4:  is just distributed to most people over there for free. But you can't count

727
00:43:00,285 --> 00:43:04,165
Speaker 4:  on that anymore. So watch two be on your phone is actually a

728
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:08,005
Speaker 4:  meaningful free television proposition now in a way

729
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:11,605
Speaker 4:  that, you know, even 10 years ago wouldn't be. So that's a big deal for

730
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:15,685
Speaker 4:  Tubi, which is just a weird thing to say. We'll see if

731
00:43:15,685 --> 00:43:19,325
Speaker 4:  it drives signups and downloads and all that stuff. But it comes right next

732
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:23,325
Speaker 4:  to Fox announcing it's gonna launch another streaming service by the

733
00:43:23,325 --> 00:43:23,845
Speaker 4:  end of this year.

734
00:43:25,365 --> 00:43:28,775
Speaker 4:  What is going on here? Like if you're about to put all this money into, why

735
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:30,055
Speaker 4:  is Fox doing this other thing? You

736
00:43:30,505 --> 00:43:34,455
Speaker 5:  Sense of this for me? I have nothing. I truly, I have, I cannot answer

737
00:43:34,455 --> 00:43:36,815
Speaker 5:  that question. I have a lot of thoughts about the Fox streaming service,

738
00:43:37,195 --> 00:43:40,135
Speaker 5:  but the why on earth would you do this? And especially why would you do it

739
00:43:40,135 --> 00:43:41,135
Speaker 5:  now? I got nothing.

740
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:45,335
Speaker 6:  What's like, I think that it's like Google and messaging services,

741
00:43:47,785 --> 00:43:48,845
Speaker 6:  you always need one more

742
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:54,285
Speaker 5:  And it's run by two teams that have no knowledge of each other and have never

743
00:43:54,285 --> 00:43:54,885
Speaker 5:  ever spoken.

744
00:43:55,535 --> 00:43:59,085
Speaker 6:  There is an executive who believes his way is the way and and says and is

745
00:43:59,085 --> 00:44:01,885
Speaker 6:  looking at Tubi and saying, yeah that's great, but what about, what if it

746
00:44:01,885 --> 00:44:02,565
Speaker 6:  were just sports?

747
00:44:03,465 --> 00:44:06,165
Speaker 4:  No, this is paid for it. I will, I will, I'll, I'll read to you.

748
00:44:07,635 --> 00:44:11,445
Speaker 4:  Lachlan Murdoch, the CEO Fox said the subscriber expectations

749
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:12,445
Speaker 4:  will be quote modest,

750
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:17,695
Speaker 4:  which is great tough and it'll price the service accordingly.

751
00:44:18,415 --> 00:44:21,375
Speaker 4:  But we do wanna reach consumers wherever they are. And there's a large population

752
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,295
Speaker 4:  now they're outside of the traditional cable bundle, whether cable, whether

753
00:44:24,325 --> 00:44:27,855
Speaker 4:  cord cutters or cord nevers. And the plan is to offer them a

754
00:44:28,295 --> 00:44:31,925
Speaker 4:  holistic streaming package featuring sports and news from the

755
00:44:32,285 --> 00:44:36,135
Speaker 4:  existing brands. So this is gonna be a weird combo platter of Fox

756
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:40,255
Speaker 4:  News and FS one, the marriage made in heaven,

757
00:44:40,465 --> 00:44:43,615
Speaker 5:  Which is basically all Fox has at this point. Like I actually went through

758
00:44:43,615 --> 00:44:46,775
Speaker 5:  it and I was like, okay, what pro, what properties does Fox have that might

759
00:44:47,045 --> 00:44:51,015
Speaker 5:  sell this? And Fox News is certainly one of them. Fox News is the dominant

760
00:44:51,225 --> 00:44:52,335
Speaker 5:  cable news platform.

761
00:44:54,445 --> 00:44:58,335
Speaker 5:  There's Fox Sports, which has some things. Fox Sports is like the

762
00:44:58,335 --> 00:45:01,735
Speaker 5:  one that like it's four times a year. I have to redownload the app to watch

763
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:05,295
Speaker 5:  something that's my Fox sports experience. And then it's pretty

764
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:09,575
Speaker 5:  bleak after that. Dude like Fox sold most of its

765
00:45:09,575 --> 00:45:12,935
Speaker 5:  entertainment assets to Disney many years ago. Famously, yes,

766
00:45:13,135 --> 00:45:15,815
Speaker 5:  2017 I think that was in

767
00:45:17,205 --> 00:45:20,625
Speaker 5:  but arguably terrible deal for Disney, which I think massively overpaid for

768
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:24,305
Speaker 5:  all of that stuff, but got all of that stuff. So like all of the

769
00:45:24,335 --> 00:45:28,265
Speaker 5:  streaming content that you think of as like Fox and fx, most

770
00:45:28,265 --> 00:45:32,065
Speaker 5:  of that is now Disney's. And so what Fox has left is essentially

771
00:45:32,235 --> 00:45:36,145
Speaker 5:  those two things you just named and what runs on the Fox channel on

772
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:39,745
Speaker 5:  your television. And can I read you guys some of the most successful shows

773
00:45:39,765 --> 00:45:42,985
Speaker 5:  on the Fox Network on television? Oh boy. And what I would like to do is,

774
00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:45,985
Speaker 5:  Richard, I'm gonna make you do this. I'm gonna read you the name of a show

775
00:45:45,985 --> 00:45:48,705
Speaker 5:  and you're going to explain to me what it's about. And I'm not going to tell

776
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:50,465
Speaker 5:  you if you're right or wrong. We're just gonna move on. How's that sound

777
00:45:50,735 --> 00:45:51,025
Speaker 5:  into

778
00:45:51,025 --> 00:45:51,585
Speaker 4:  It? Love

779
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:55,225
Speaker 5:  It. Okay. The number one show on Fox in fall of 2024, the ot,

780
00:45:56,995 --> 00:46:00,775
Speaker 4:  That's football over time. No, that's what, that's a group of Zoomers

781
00:46:00,775 --> 00:46:01,855
Speaker 4:  take over an ad agency.

782
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:06,205
Speaker 5:  Okay. 9 1 1 Lone Star.

783
00:46:09,205 --> 00:46:10,465
Speaker 5:  I'm not making any of these up,

784
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:14,105
Speaker 4:  It's so important to me why that you know this Why Lone Star

785
00:46:15,365 --> 00:46:17,225
Speaker 4:  is there? It's a group of Cowboy Zoomers.

786
00:46:19,175 --> 00:46:20,265
Speaker 5:  Okay. I watch that.

787
00:46:22,575 --> 00:46:23,745
Speaker 5:  It's all have iPhone. iPhones good.

788
00:46:26,135 --> 00:46:28,865
Speaker 4:  Like that's a hit show. So yeah, I, I believe that.

789
00:46:29,015 --> 00:46:32,305
Speaker 5:  Okay. Then we have the Mass Singer, which I think every everyone knows

790
00:46:32,575 --> 00:46:35,825
Speaker 4:  I've the 9 1 1 Lone Star Outranking. The Mass Singer is also

791
00:46:35,825 --> 00:46:38,665
Speaker 5:  Weak. Tough beat. Yeah, it's tough. Beat Rescue High Surf

792
00:46:40,935 --> 00:46:42,995
Speaker 4:  Is that It's Zoomers, but they're Baywatch.

793
00:46:43,015 --> 00:46:45,755
Speaker 5:  Oh, I'm sorry. I think it's Rescue Hawaii Dash Surf.

794
00:46:46,775 --> 00:46:50,715
Speaker 4:  Ah, well see, there you go. Did you just read the word Hawaii wrong? It,

795
00:46:50,745 --> 00:46:51,035
Speaker 4:  it's,

796
00:46:51,035 --> 00:46:53,675
Speaker 5:  It's, it's in all caps. It's hard to tell what's wrong. Sure. Yeah, yeah.

797
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:58,735
Speaker 5:  And then can I interest you in the floor at number five?

798
00:46:59,725 --> 00:47:01,775
Speaker 5:  This is my point. This is if you're Fox,

799
00:47:02,485 --> 00:47:02,775
Speaker 4:  Just,

800
00:47:02,805 --> 00:47:05,775
Speaker 5:  Just call the thing Fox News. It's the only thing anyone is

801
00:47:05,775 --> 00:47:09,425
Speaker 4:  Gonna come for. They have a Fox News app and they have Fox Nation

802
00:47:09,685 --> 00:47:12,545
Speaker 4:  the streaming service. This is what I mean. Okay. Take it back. If you're

803
00:47:12,545 --> 00:47:16,025
Speaker 4:  about to do the Super Bowl in Tubby, which in the NFL does not let you do

804
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:19,865
Speaker 4:  that for free. Right, right. It's not just like a little side show like,

805
00:47:19,885 --> 00:47:20,825
Speaker 4:  oh, we're, well, to be fair, think

806
00:47:21,095 --> 00:47:22,705
Speaker 5:  Have to do that. If you're Fox like 'cause to

807
00:47:23,315 --> 00:47:27,225
Speaker 4:  Point, let's build up the, the one we have with the Super

808
00:47:27,255 --> 00:47:31,235
Speaker 4:  Bowl that we're gonna give to a bunch of cop and Cowboy

809
00:47:31,305 --> 00:47:35,235
Speaker 4:  Zoomers for free on their phones. That's just my belief.

810
00:47:35,295 --> 00:47:35,515
Speaker 4:  Now

811
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:40,395
Speaker 4:  why on earth are you launching this other one? So you can stream the mass

812
00:47:40,395 --> 00:47:43,035
Speaker 4:  singer to six to a modest number of subscribers.

813
00:47:44,415 --> 00:47:48,235
Speaker 4:  I'm, this thing is al this thing is at 80 on the go, 90 scale. This is

814
00:47:48,915 --> 00:47:52,395
Speaker 4:  Thursday night dinner. It's, it's, it's just what you have. It's just you

815
00:47:52,395 --> 00:47:52,875
Speaker 4:  gotta do it.

816
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:55,955
Speaker 5:  It's just, it's yeah. You open the fridge, throw some stuff in.

817
00:47:56,185 --> 00:47:59,915
Speaker 4:  Yeah, this is like succession style. Like Lachlan Murdoch has his own children

818
00:48:00,015 --> 00:48:02,555
Speaker 4:  who wanna run something and he is like, do a streaming service. And it's

819
00:48:02,555 --> 00:48:06,355
Speaker 4:  like, fine, you can just like putter along. Okay. Go 90 scale of

820
00:48:06,355 --> 00:48:10,235
Speaker 4:  Doom streaming services, the, the classic Vergecast scale

821
00:48:10,295 --> 00:48:14,275
Speaker 4:  of how likely a streaming service is to survive. Zero is alive, 90 is

822
00:48:14,275 --> 00:48:18,155
Speaker 4:  dead. Named after Go 90 Verizon's streaming service in which

823
00:48:18,155 --> 00:48:21,515
Speaker 4:  they wanted young people to join a gang to compete with YouTube.

824
00:48:22,255 --> 00:48:24,155
Speaker 4:  I'm not kidding. That was all real. That's

825
00:48:24,155 --> 00:48:24,995
Speaker 5:  Literally what it was. Yeah.

826
00:48:25,275 --> 00:48:27,595
Speaker 4:  There was a button that was like, join a crew. It was very silly.

827
00:48:29,635 --> 00:48:33,455
Speaker 4:  I'm putting whatever this Fox Sports thing is an 80. And then just

828
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:37,375
Speaker 4:  because it exists, I think Tubi clicks up to like a 70.

829
00:48:37,975 --> 00:48:41,855
Speaker 5:  I I would leave Tubi lower. I think I'm putting Tubi at like a 35 just because

830
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:45,215
Speaker 5:  Tubi is a working, and BA totally different

831
00:48:45,935 --> 00:48:46,055
Speaker 5:  business.

832
00:48:46,415 --> 00:48:49,895
Speaker 4:  Right. But once, once you start messing with all these other ones, the idea

833
00:48:49,895 --> 00:48:53,735
Speaker 4:  that you're gonna roll Tubi into this other thing and read brand like the

834
00:48:53,735 --> 00:48:54,975
Speaker 4:  Door's open now. Oh,

835
00:48:54,995 --> 00:48:58,335
Speaker 5:  That's fair. Okay. The, the ongoing existence of Tubi

836
00:48:59,195 --> 00:49:03,185
Speaker 5:  might be in, in threat because it'll

837
00:49:03,185 --> 00:49:05,905
Speaker 5:  all just get rolled into Fox Plus or whatever.

838
00:49:05,915 --> 00:49:09,785
Speaker 4:  Right. Do we want Fox Nation and the Fox Sports app and Tubi and this

839
00:49:09,785 --> 00:49:10,185
Speaker 4:  new one?

840
00:49:10,545 --> 00:49:14,265
Speaker 5:  I mean, given Fox's history hell yeah. More apps, more fun.

841
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:17,945
Speaker 4:  I, I'm just saying like, this is the thing that, like you, they've kept by

842
00:49:17,945 --> 00:49:21,745
Speaker 4:  the way, the Fox Sports app and the Fox Nation app apart for a long time

843
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:25,745
Speaker 4:  just because of the, the political reality that a lot of people will not

844
00:49:25,905 --> 00:49:27,065
Speaker 4:  download a, a Fox sports app to watch.

845
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:30,745
Speaker 5:  Well, but also those are things that you log into with your cable subscription.

846
00:49:30,745 --> 00:49:34,465
Speaker 5:  Right. And I think there's a really interesting world of

847
00:49:34,495 --> 00:49:37,905
Speaker 5:  like the TV everywhere promise that never came to fruition.

848
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:38,545
Speaker 5:  Oh

849
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:42,225
Speaker 4:  Man, Richard and I lived through the TV everywhere Wars, man,

850
00:49:43,205 --> 00:49:46,305
Speaker 5:  My, my hottest take is that TV everywhere was actually the correct idea

851
00:49:47,005 --> 00:49:50,745
Speaker 5:  and that everyone who blew it should be fired because TV

852
00:49:50,745 --> 00:49:54,655
Speaker 5:  everywhere was a good and right. And we're just gonna do

853
00:49:54,655 --> 00:49:55,535
Speaker 5:  it again, but the interface

854
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,375
Speaker 4:  Gonna be worse. But somewhere some like ancient grizzled TV executive popped

855
00:49:58,575 --> 00:50:00,895
Speaker 4:  up out of a coffin like Dracula and was like, I knew it.

856
00:50:01,845 --> 00:50:04,495
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Somebody like the History Channel is like, that's what I've been saying.

857
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:06,255
Speaker 4:  No way, dude.

858
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:10,695
Speaker 5:  But I'm, I'm putting the idea of like a standalone

859
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:15,175
Speaker 5:  Fox streaming service if it's more than just the cable channel

860
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:18,535
Speaker 5:  over the internet, which, or the broadcast channel over the internet, which

861
00:50:18,535 --> 00:50:21,735
Speaker 5:  it might be like the, was it the Weather Channel? I think that just put out

862
00:50:21,735 --> 00:50:24,655
Speaker 5:  a thing that they were like for $5 a month here is just, it's just the Weather

863
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:28,325
Speaker 5:  Channel. You can have that, that I think is fine.

864
00:50:28,515 --> 00:50:31,965
Speaker 5:  That can live forever and no one will subscribe to it, but it's not a lot

865
00:50:31,965 --> 00:50:35,125
Speaker 5:  of like, marginal, extra work. So it'll be fine. But if Fox is like, we're

866
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:38,765
Speaker 5:  gonna do Netflix with Fox Properties on a strong,

867
00:50:38,915 --> 00:50:41,885
Speaker 5:  like 82 from day one. Yeah.

868
00:50:42,195 --> 00:50:43,205
Speaker 4:  Richard, where are you at?

869
00:50:43,835 --> 00:50:47,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think that comes out in 81 for me. I'm still putting Tubi down

870
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:51,605
Speaker 6:  at like 20 I I believe in Tubi. Alright. I, I just, I I think, I

871
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:52,205
Speaker 6:  think they've got it.

872
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:56,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, you love shows about Zoomers taking over ad agencies. There's

873
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:57,165
Speaker 4:  one thing I know about you, Richard.

874
00:50:57,525 --> 00:51:00,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The, the Z suite. It's gonna make it, I I'm going to be fascinated

875
00:51:00,965 --> 00:51:04,805
Speaker 5:  to see what happens to Tubi right after the Super Bowl because I think

876
00:51:04,805 --> 00:51:08,205
Speaker 5:  the thing that's gonna happen is that a lot of people are going to discover

877
00:51:08,445 --> 00:51:12,085
Speaker 5:  A, that Tub B exists, and B, that there is a

878
00:51:12,085 --> 00:51:15,805
Speaker 5:  streaming service that you don't have to log into or pay for that just has

879
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:17,325
Speaker 5:  things on all the time. All

880
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:19,445
Speaker 6:  That stuff you used to watch on Netflix, it's there.

881
00:51:19,975 --> 00:51:23,605
Speaker 5:  Right. And, and there, there is something different

882
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:27,925
Speaker 5:  about the appeal of these free fast services that

883
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:32,285
Speaker 5:  I think we don't talk about enough that is like, it, it's actually

884
00:51:32,285 --> 00:51:35,245
Speaker 5:  in a lot of ways, like the antidote to I'm paying for too many streaming

885
00:51:35,405 --> 00:51:38,565
Speaker 5:  services is just go to Tubi and pick something. And I think there, there's

886
00:51:38,565 --> 00:51:40,965
Speaker 5:  like a real thing there that I think a lot of people are about to be turned

887
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:41,125
Speaker 5:  onto.

888
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And you can go listen to that decoder with Angel. 'cause she makes

889
00:51:44,405 --> 00:51:47,925
Speaker 4:  that case very loudly. Yeah. Like this is, this is, there's growth here and

890
00:51:47,925 --> 00:51:50,405
Speaker 4:  we can see it. And, and the numbers are real. I think she's, right now she's

891
00:51:50,405 --> 00:51:53,685
Speaker 4:  got the Super Bowls, see how it goes. By the way, this is all next to Disney

892
00:51:53,685 --> 00:51:57,405
Speaker 4:  Head earnings this week. Disney plus their streaming division posted

893
00:51:57,565 --> 00:52:01,085
Speaker 4:  a profit, which is a big deal for Disney. They have not done that for a long

894
00:52:01,085 --> 00:52:04,685
Speaker 4:  time. But then they're also like ESPN has become a very expensive

895
00:52:05,685 --> 00:52:08,645
Speaker 4:  subscription sports product. And it's like, Ooh. Yeah.

896
00:52:09,235 --> 00:52:13,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Richard, you and I were both reading this trying to decide whether

897
00:52:13,145 --> 00:52:17,045
Speaker 5:  to be, I think, surprised by the way that Disney

898
00:52:17,045 --> 00:52:20,165
Speaker 5:  is betting on ESPN or if this was just like, obviously the way it was gonna

899
00:52:20,165 --> 00:52:23,725
Speaker 5:  go. And of course Disney just took a weird path to get here. But basically

900
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:26,605
Speaker 5:  venue is gone. Disney sold off.

901
00:52:27,045 --> 00:52:29,645
Speaker 4:  I, like you said, venue is gone. Like anyone knows what venue was.

902
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:32,925
Speaker 5:  We did a whole, you know, listen, If you don't know what venue was, it doesn't

903
00:52:32,925 --> 00:52:36,245
Speaker 5:  matter 'cause it's gone Now. Venue, which was gonna be the like big sports

904
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:40,365
Speaker 5:  bundle never came alive in the first place. Disney sold

905
00:52:40,425 --> 00:52:44,165
Speaker 5:  off the Hulu with live TV thing to fuo, which is now still mostly

906
00:52:44,165 --> 00:52:47,565
Speaker 5:  owned by Disney. But like that's a separate thing that runs on itself now.

907
00:52:48,105 --> 00:52:52,005
Speaker 5:  And Disney is basically just like we are all in on ESPN as

908
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:55,365
Speaker 5:  the primary brand. They're launching this flagship thing later this year.

909
00:52:55,675 --> 00:52:58,765
Speaker 5:  They're integrating fantasy and betting and it's like, that's the big bet.

910
00:52:58,985 --> 00:53:02,885
Speaker 5:  And it's very weird to me that it took Disney this long to

911
00:53:02,885 --> 00:53:06,765
Speaker 5:  realize, oh, ESPN is an enormous brand and we should probably just

912
00:53:06,785 --> 00:53:10,205
Speaker 5:  bet everything on it and not this weird distribution thing we're trying to

913
00:53:10,205 --> 00:53:10,845
Speaker 5:  do. I

914
00:53:10,845 --> 00:53:14,805
Speaker 6:  Wonder where they got that idea to have like a bundle of content that's centered

915
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:18,485
Speaker 6:  around ESPN and sports that people will pay for on a monthly basis

916
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:20,205
Speaker 6:  to watch. Huh. I just,

917
00:53:20,845 --> 00:53:21,655
Speaker 5:  It's a pretty good idea.

918
00:53:22,665 --> 00:53:24,445
Speaker 6:  So it's a cool concept if they can make it work.

919
00:53:25,155 --> 00:53:29,125
Speaker 4:  Okay. Here's the weird thing though, right? The, the majority of ESPN's

920
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:32,765
Speaker 4:  daytime programming now is the Pat MV show, which is

921
00:53:32,915 --> 00:53:36,855
Speaker 4:  also just streaming away on YouTube. You don't have

922
00:53:36,855 --> 00:53:40,655
Speaker 4:  to pay for ESPN to get that show, which is again, the bulk

923
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,455
Speaker 4:  of the afternoon on ESPN. I

924
00:53:43,455 --> 00:53:47,055
Speaker 5:  Think of that as like if ESPN could go back to the days where like cable

925
00:53:47,055 --> 00:53:50,855
Speaker 5:  channels just turned off for periods of time, I think EPN would happen to

926
00:53:50,855 --> 00:53:54,495
Speaker 5:  do it. Like, and it's just, it, it is the most filler

927
00:53:54,495 --> 00:53:58,175
Speaker 5:  content of all time and it's fine. And ESPN just

928
00:53:58,185 --> 00:54:02,175
Speaker 5:  rolls at the, like, it's ESPN's whole thing is is games, right? Like

929
00:54:02,175 --> 00:54:05,535
Speaker 5:  that's, they, they need places to show you stuff. And for EPN to be like,

930
00:54:05,535 --> 00:54:09,335
Speaker 5:  oh, we're gonna make everything available to everywhere all the time always

931
00:54:09,335 --> 00:54:11,935
Speaker 5:  seemed weird. But instead it's like, do you want the Disney bundle? Come

932
00:54:11,935 --> 00:54:15,925
Speaker 5:  here and watch sports. It's like, that's, that's cable. And it

933
00:54:15,925 --> 00:54:19,045
Speaker 5:  worked super well for Disney for literally decades. It's

934
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:23,245
Speaker 4:  Fascinating that you think that ESPN is games when I think of it as yelling

935
00:54:23,275 --> 00:54:23,565
Speaker 4:  guys.

936
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:26,085
Speaker 5:  I mean, it's, it's also yelling guys.

937
00:54:26,315 --> 00:54:30,165
Speaker 4:  It's like, it's so much yelling guys. Yeah, right. It's, it's Stephen A. Smith.

938
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:34,585
Speaker 4:  Like it's, but for a long time you can only get Stephen A. Smith on ES espn

939
00:54:35,185 --> 00:54:38,405
Speaker 4:  and I think McAfee show is just a weird one for them because it's,

940
00:54:39,355 --> 00:54:42,925
Speaker 4:  it's yelling guys, but they're also available for free on YouTube. And I

941
00:54:42,925 --> 00:54:45,805
Speaker 4:  think a bunch of streaming companies are starting to realize that they just

942
00:54:45,805 --> 00:54:49,565
Speaker 4:  need to make nice with YouTube. Like Warner put a bunch of full movies

943
00:54:49,905 --> 00:54:52,685
Speaker 4:  on YouTube for free this week. Fascinating. And I, I, I couldn't tell you

944
00:54:52,685 --> 00:54:56,045
Speaker 4:  why, but I think they're like, it's better to get pennies from our catalog

945
00:54:56,145 --> 00:54:58,765
Speaker 4:  on YouTube than $0 and lose to YouTube.

946
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:02,925
Speaker 6:  I think that's exactly it. I think that for e, espn, the Pat McAfee show

947
00:55:02,985 --> 00:55:06,965
Speaker 6:  on, on YouTube is better than you listening to, you know, a podcast

948
00:55:07,185 --> 00:55:09,725
Speaker 6:  or Sports Star Radio that isn't owned by e espn.

949
00:55:09,915 --> 00:55:12,805
Speaker 4:  Well I think they would be very, very, everyone would be very careful to

950
00:55:12,805 --> 00:55:16,645
Speaker 4:  say that they don't own the Pat McAfee show and in fact can barely control

951
00:55:16,645 --> 00:55:20,405
Speaker 4:  it and can barely influence anything about it at

952
00:55:20,425 --> 00:55:24,285
Speaker 4:  any time. It's just a weird moment. I it's a weird moment for sports.

953
00:55:24,305 --> 00:55:27,125
Speaker 4:  You know, the Super Bowl sort of always brings everything to a head. There's

954
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:31,085
Speaker 4:  always rights negotiations going on, but it does seem like you're

955
00:55:31,085 --> 00:55:35,005
Speaker 4:  gonna end up with a bunch of to be like things or a bunch of

956
00:55:35,005 --> 00:55:38,765
Speaker 4:  free fast services and then a bunch of very expensive sports

957
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:42,925
Speaker 4:  subscriptions. Yep. Like that feels like the, the breakdown of the,

958
00:55:42,945 --> 00:55:44,125
Speaker 4:  the streaming industry right now.

959
00:55:44,315 --> 00:55:47,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It really does feel like that's where we're headed. And we've come

960
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:51,725
Speaker 5:  out of an era where there was a running theory that maybe if we had enough

961
00:55:52,145 --> 00:55:56,085
Speaker 5:  really great high-end premium content that people would

962
00:55:56,085 --> 00:56:00,005
Speaker 5:  pay a lot for. It turns out that's a bad business. So we're just

963
00:56:00,005 --> 00:56:03,965
Speaker 5:  back to sports. We're just doing sports and reality TV again. Yeah. And it's

964
00:56:03,965 --> 00:56:07,605
Speaker 5:  gonna get messy. Oh, and gambling now, which is the real ESPN thing. That's

965
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:09,965
Speaker 5:  why you make the app If you s espn is for gambling. Richard,

966
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:13,805
Speaker 4:  What do you think about the, the rumor that the Mavs or tanking

967
00:56:14,025 --> 00:56:17,335
Speaker 4:  so they can move to Vegas? Another deep cut.

968
00:56:19,135 --> 00:56:21,695
Speaker 6:  I I think, I think there's a lot to it. I mean, if, If you, If you look into

969
00:56:21,695 --> 00:56:22,695
Speaker 6:  it, there's a lot there.

970
00:56:23,515 --> 00:56:27,495
Speaker 4:  All right. That's just more conspiracy theories from Richard dying gas

971
00:56:27,495 --> 00:56:31,375
Speaker 4:  for the cable industry by the way, at Super Real Time. Comcast, which

972
00:56:31,415 --> 00:56:35,135
Speaker 4:  I should disclose through NBC Universal is a minority investor

973
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:38,615
Speaker 4:  in our parent company. Vox Media. I'm gonna finish this segment, you'll understand

974
00:56:38,615 --> 00:56:41,895
Speaker 4:  why that's I relevant information. Comcast in a dying

975
00:56:42,405 --> 00:56:46,335
Speaker 4:  gasp per relevance here at the Super Bowl is they announced this week

976
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:49,535
Speaker 4:  they're gonna, they're gonna broadcast the Super Bowl in

977
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:53,655
Speaker 4:  4K Dolby vision. And now for the first time, Dolby Atmos

978
00:56:54,735 --> 00:56:57,955
Speaker 4:  and I, a lot of people send this to us because everyone knows that all I

979
00:56:57,955 --> 00:57:01,475
Speaker 4:  want in my life is for all of the lights semi receiver to light up

980
00:57:01,825 --> 00:57:05,475
Speaker 4:  with all of the formats. If I could listen to Atmos and

981
00:57:05,545 --> 00:57:09,395
Speaker 4:  Butcher HD at the same time, I'd be so happy. And DTSX, like

982
00:57:09,465 --> 00:57:11,955
Speaker 4:  just all the lights, just light 'em all up. That's all I want. I'm barely

983
00:57:12,235 --> 00:57:16,075
Speaker 4:  watching the movie. I'm just looking for the lights. This should

984
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:17,315
Speaker 4:  make me happy 'cause I can finally

985
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:22,415
Speaker 4:  get all the lights watching the Super Bowl. Here's the problem. Comcast is

986
00:57:22,415 --> 00:57:24,855
Speaker 4:  a regional cable monopoly and they're not available where I live here in

987
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:27,455
Speaker 4:  New York state. So problem number one. So they're dead to me. Problem number

988
00:57:27,455 --> 00:57:31,385
Speaker 4:  two, super fake, super fake.

989
00:57:31,685 --> 00:57:32,665
Speaker 5:  The Atmos is fake,

990
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:36,945
Speaker 4:  Atmos is fake. The 4K is fake. The HDR is well sort of fake. So

991
00:57:37,045 --> 00:57:40,945
Speaker 4:  Fox is doing the Super Bowl in 4K, they're adding more 4K cameras

992
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:44,305
Speaker 4:  to the production this year, including their Slowmo cameras, which they didn't

993
00:57:44,305 --> 00:57:47,785
Speaker 4:  have before in 4K, but then they produce it in 10 80

994
00:57:47,945 --> 00:57:51,305
Speaker 4:  PHDR and then upscale it at distribution.

995
00:57:52,225 --> 00:57:56,205
Speaker 4:  And this is because Fox broadcast is at seven 20 P. So they

996
00:57:56,205 --> 00:57:59,965
Speaker 4:  just picked the middle format so they could go over the air at seven 20

997
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:03,765
Speaker 4:  p and then out to streaming at upscale 4K. This is the worst compromise of

998
00:58:03,765 --> 00:58:07,525
Speaker 4:  all time. It make it, I hate it. I hate it. So the actual

999
00:58:07,555 --> 00:58:10,885
Speaker 4:  4K feed from Fox is upscaled

1000
00:58:11,035 --> 00:58:14,645
Speaker 4:  4K from 10 80 p in, I believe it's

1001
00:58:14,805 --> 00:58:18,405
Speaker 4:  H-L-G-H-D-R, just some other format. It's the best format for live.

1002
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:22,665
Speaker 4:  Comcast is taking that feed in, in it's, I believe in

1003
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:26,225
Speaker 4:  5.1 Adobe Digital Comcast is taking that feed.

1004
00:58:26,935 --> 00:58:27,385
Speaker 4:  They are

1005
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:31,825
Speaker 4:  wrapping the HLG into Do Vision so they can claim they have Adobe vision.

1006
00:58:32,205 --> 00:58:35,345
Speaker 4:  So it's not right, it's, it's weird. That's just a weird thing they're doing.

1007
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:38,945
Speaker 4:  And then they're upmixing the audio from 5.1 to Atmos.

1008
00:58:39,165 --> 00:58:43,145
Speaker 5:  It makes me think of those people who just like pour tap water into

1009
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,025
Speaker 5:  bottles and then sell it as bottled water.

1010
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:46,185
Speaker 4:  I

1011
00:58:46,185 --> 00:58:49,025
Speaker 5:  Was like, did we actually, did we accomplish anything here?

1012
00:58:49,135 --> 00:58:52,065
Speaker 4:  It's good. I love the idea and I, I don't know they're doing this. I will

1013
00:58:52,255 --> 00:58:56,065
Speaker 4:  forgive Comcast for doing this weird fake up mixing.

1014
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:59,785
Speaker 4:  If they actually have a guy with like a, an audio joystick

1015
00:59:00,575 --> 00:59:04,465
Speaker 4:  like making swooping atmos sounds right? Like his job is

1016
00:59:04,465 --> 00:59:07,625
Speaker 4:  to track the ball in flight and be like, it's over you, it's behind you.

1017
00:59:07,655 --> 00:59:10,025
Speaker 4:  Like I'll find, show me that guy.

1018
00:59:10,695 --> 00:59:14,585
Speaker 5:  Okay, different idea. It's just Tom Brady running around your living

1019
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:14,785
Speaker 5:  room.

1020
00:59:15,365 --> 00:59:18,585
Speaker 4:  That's right. I'm saying like, show me the guy with the track, the atmos

1021
00:59:18,585 --> 00:59:22,525
Speaker 4:  track pad. You know, like, I dunno if anybody, If you ever seen like

1022
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:26,485
Speaker 4:  a logic mixing setup PR atmos, it's like they have a sound field and you

1023
00:59:26,485 --> 00:59:29,365
Speaker 4:  can move the sound object. Just show me the guy with the mouse just like

1024
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:31,925
Speaker 4:  moving the sound objects in real time.

1025
00:59:33,345 --> 00:59:34,955
Speaker 4:  I'll believe you. I don't think it's happening.

1026
00:59:35,455 --> 00:59:38,955
Speaker 5:  Should the ball always be sneaking up on you? Like is that the, is that the

1027
00:59:38,955 --> 00:59:39,275
Speaker 5:  right answer?

1028
00:59:39,655 --> 00:59:42,715
Speaker 4:  That's what I'm saying. I don't actually, I don't know what either

1029
00:59:43,065 --> 00:59:46,955
Speaker 4:  quarterback's cadence is, but I'm just imagining Dak Prescott doing, here

1030
00:59:46,955 --> 00:59:48,755
Speaker 4:  we go. And it's like right behind you.

1031
00:59:49,465 --> 00:59:53,115
Speaker 5:  Yeah, you're the center and it's right behind your head yelling at you.

1032
00:59:53,515 --> 00:59:56,675
Speaker 4:  I don't know man, but there, this is, this is Comcast effort

1033
00:59:57,335 --> 01:00:00,915
Speaker 4:  to get you to sign up for a, a cable package is fake atmos envision.

1034
01:00:01,995 --> 01:00:04,735
Speaker 4:  And again, if they wanna, you know, they wanna call me and complain,

1035
01:00:05,845 --> 01:00:09,255
Speaker 4:  I'll hear 'em out. But there's a, there's a specific image I'm looking for

1036
01:00:09,915 --> 01:00:13,615
Speaker 4:  and it's the guy whose job it is to realtime pan the sound of the football

1037
01:00:13,615 --> 01:00:17,015
Speaker 4:  around the sound field. No, you would take that job. It's not, it's not the

1038
01:00:17,095 --> 01:00:20,815
Speaker 4:  guy. It's, it's a, it's someone moving Taylor Swift's voice very

1039
01:00:21,055 --> 01:00:24,095
Speaker 4:  specifically around mistaken. She's like, that's the thing. She's up in the

1040
01:00:24,095 --> 01:00:24,255
Speaker 4:  crowd.

1041
01:00:25,845 --> 01:00:26,135
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1042
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:29,255
Speaker 5:  Taylor's just strapped to the sky cam thing moving around the field

1043
01:00:29,515 --> 01:00:31,775
Speaker 4:  All there. Or, or I'll, I'll just, I'll I'll throw this one out there and

1044
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:35,735
Speaker 4:  I know people are gonna have feelings about it. A guy who, or a button in

1045
01:00:35,735 --> 01:00:39,615
Speaker 4:  the interface that lets you select Tom Brady's voice

1046
01:00:39,955 --> 01:00:41,855
Speaker 4:  in the sound field and turn it off.

1047
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:42,735
Speaker 7:  Ooh,

1048
01:00:43,155 --> 01:00:43,735
Speaker 5:  Now you're talking,

1049
01:00:44,395 --> 01:00:46,255
Speaker 4:  You and the, the real head snow.

1050
01:00:48,195 --> 01:00:50,775
Speaker 4:  All right, let's take a break from this. We'll come back with lightning round.

1051
01:02:05,205 --> 01:02:08,415
Speaker 4:  Someone else will say your company's name and then we'll do whatever we want.

1052
01:02:08,965 --> 01:02:12,855
Speaker 4:  It's a great deal. And I'm confident our previous sponsors have received

1053
01:02:13,175 --> 01:02:17,095
Speaker 4:  numerous signups, whoever they were. Okay, we we, there's

1054
01:02:17,095 --> 01:02:19,320
Speaker 4:  one thing in the streaming section that we didn't talk about, talk about

1055
01:02:19,585 --> 01:02:23,445
Speaker 4:  not quite super old streaming but pretty interesting. Sonos has been

1056
01:02:23,445 --> 01:02:27,205
Speaker 4:  going through just convulsions. Patrick Spence, the former

1057
01:02:27,405 --> 01:02:31,125
Speaker 4:  CEO who we've talked to many, many times over the years is gone after the

1058
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:35,085
Speaker 4:  AP debacle. They have a new CEO Tom Conrad who we have also known

1059
01:02:35,105 --> 01:02:38,765
Speaker 4:  for a long time. Speaking of which Richard, he was the CTO of

1060
01:02:38,885 --> 01:02:42,775
Speaker 4:  Quibi and before that Pandora. Yeah, he's been everywhere.

1061
01:02:42,835 --> 01:02:45,535
Speaker 5:  He was everywhere. He was also at Snap for a minute I think. Like he's just

1062
01:02:45,535 --> 01:02:47,055
Speaker 5:  Yeah, he's that that dude. His

1063
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:49,575
Speaker 4:  Stories. Tom's a smart guy. Yeah, we've invited him on the show. I think

1064
01:02:49,575 --> 01:02:52,095
Speaker 4:  when things settle down at Sonos, we, we'll, we'll definitely talk to him.

1065
01:02:53,485 --> 01:02:57,415
Speaker 4:  He's been on their board forever, but he's come into the company and

1066
01:02:57,435 --> 01:03:00,295
Speaker 4:  you know, his first move is, he's like, we need to be smaller and flatter

1067
01:03:00,295 --> 01:03:03,095
Speaker 4:  and more nimble. They're laying off 200 more people. So this company is,

1068
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:07,225
Speaker 4:  some stuff is happening there. But then Chris Welch this week

1069
01:03:07,765 --> 01:03:10,825
Speaker 4:  got more details about the streaming box that we've been hearing about for

1070
01:03:10,865 --> 01:03:14,585
Speaker 4:  a long time. It, it sounds pretty good. David,

1071
01:03:14,585 --> 01:03:15,305
Speaker 4:  what's going on here?

1072
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:19,905
Speaker 5:  I, I agree. This is sort of the streaming box you would

1073
01:03:20,095 --> 01:03:24,025
Speaker 5:  want there to be in the world, which I find very exciting. So the thing

1074
01:03:24,025 --> 01:03:27,905
Speaker 5:  is called Pinewood, that's the code name that Chris watch has heard. Mark

1075
01:03:28,065 --> 01:03:31,265
Speaker 5:  Germin also I think reported a while ago that it was called Pinewood. I assume

1076
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:34,425
Speaker 5:  that's not the name because everybody gives their actual products worse names

1077
01:03:34,425 --> 01:03:38,185
Speaker 5:  than the code names. But that's the code name. And I would say

1078
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:41,825
Speaker 5:  the two biggest features of it are that a, it

1079
01:03:42,025 --> 01:03:45,545
Speaker 5:  apparently has actual honest to God universal search

1080
01:03:45,685 --> 01:03:49,545
Speaker 5:  across lots of different streaming services. So you can look for

1081
01:03:49,545 --> 01:03:52,825
Speaker 5:  things across all of the services that you subscribe to, which essentially

1082
01:03:52,825 --> 01:03:56,745
Speaker 5:  doesn't exist on any other platform. Everybody has some section of them,

1083
01:03:56,805 --> 01:04:00,745
Speaker 5:  but nobody really has everybody. So if in theory Sonos

1084
01:04:00,745 --> 01:04:04,385
Speaker 5:  has actually pulled all of your streaming into a single unified

1085
01:04:04,385 --> 01:04:06,185
Speaker 5:  interface, that would be very cool.

1086
01:04:06,185 --> 01:04:07,825
Speaker 4:  What do you think the possibility of that actually is?

1087
01:04:08,485 --> 01:04:11,865
Speaker 5:  Low, I'm super skeptical of that for a bunch of reasons. One,

1088
01:04:13,305 --> 01:04:17,265
Speaker 5:  I don't know why any of these companies would sign up for that. For

1089
01:04:17,435 --> 01:04:21,225
Speaker 5:  Sonos in particular. It's possible that Sonos is paying pretty handsomely

1090
01:04:21,225 --> 01:04:24,385
Speaker 5:  for this. Krista's reporting says that it's gonna cost somewhere between

1091
01:04:24,385 --> 01:04:28,345
Speaker 5:  200, $400 for the box, which is a lot. And maybe there's a real

1092
01:04:28,455 --> 01:04:32,385
Speaker 5:  part of that baked in that is Sonos paid for this search product to

1093
01:04:32,385 --> 01:04:36,065
Speaker 5:  be great. But I doubt it. Like I just don't think these companies have any

1094
01:04:36,065 --> 01:04:40,025
Speaker 5:  incentive to play nicely together, specifically with Sonos and

1095
01:04:40,025 --> 01:04:43,785
Speaker 5:  to do it here. You, you lose all kinds of leverage. Like

1096
01:04:44,225 --> 01:04:47,825
Speaker 5:  suddenly Apple is just gonna show up at your door and be like, listen, here

1097
01:04:47,825 --> 01:04:48,265
Speaker 5:  we go.

1098
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:52,265
Speaker 4:  Yeah, famously Apple cannot get Netflix to play in its search product.

1099
01:04:52,675 --> 01:04:56,585
Speaker 5:  Right? There's also the fact that this operating system

1100
01:04:56,605 --> 01:05:00,505
Speaker 5:  is being built either in partnership or just licensed from a

1101
01:05:00,505 --> 01:05:03,945
Speaker 5:  company called the Trade Desk, which is a digital advertising company. It's

1102
01:05:03,945 --> 01:05:07,465
Speaker 5:  very weird. Like I, I would not say I have a ton of faith in this interface

1103
01:05:08,165 --> 01:05:11,705
Speaker 5:  period. Sonos is not famously great at user

1104
01:05:11,715 --> 01:05:15,585
Speaker 5:  interfaces. I wouldn't say not anymore. So the idea that this is, they were,

1105
01:05:15,855 --> 01:05:19,085
Speaker 4:  They were, I mean this is is why they were a dominant player in their little

1106
01:05:19,085 --> 01:05:20,365
Speaker 4:  space for a long time. Like they, no,

1107
01:05:20,365 --> 01:05:23,365
Speaker 5:  They're really great at networking their speakers. Which brings us to the

1108
01:05:23,365 --> 01:05:27,125
Speaker 5:  other thing that Pinewood is apparently gonna be very good at is it's, it's

1109
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:30,525
Speaker 5:  going to be a mix of an HDMI switch

1110
01:05:30,945 --> 01:05:34,805
Speaker 5:  and a way to connect your whole Sonos system.

1111
01:05:34,825 --> 01:05:37,925
Speaker 5:  So it seems like one of the animating principles for this device was a bunch

1112
01:05:37,925 --> 01:05:41,245
Speaker 5:  of Sonos people being annoyed that it was hard to connect your TV

1113
01:05:42,065 --> 01:05:45,685
Speaker 5:  to your Sonos devices and to all of your other home theater devices.

1114
01:05:45,945 --> 01:05:48,725
Speaker 5:  And that by building the thing in the middle they could solve this problem

1115
01:05:48,725 --> 01:05:51,365
Speaker 5:  and make it easier to do things like build a home theater setup out of your

1116
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:55,965
Speaker 5:  Sonos gear and all kinds of different stuff that would be very

1117
01:05:55,965 --> 01:05:59,565
Speaker 5:  compelling to Sonos people. And I can understand why there would be people

1118
01:05:59,585 --> 01:06:03,245
Speaker 5:  who would pay for that, make it easier, make it better to

1119
01:06:03,245 --> 01:06:04,805
Speaker 5:  connect all my stuff to my tv. Sure.

1120
01:06:06,785 --> 01:06:10,315
Speaker 5:  That is the thing. Sonos does very well and has done well for a long time

1121
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:14,235
Speaker 5:  until it screwed up its app really bad. So I have, I have reasonably high

1122
01:06:14,235 --> 01:06:17,875
Speaker 5:  hopes that it could pull that off. But then the overarching question here

1123
01:06:17,875 --> 01:06:21,755
Speaker 5:  is like, does all of that add up to the most

1124
01:06:21,945 --> 01:06:25,875
Speaker 5:  expensive set top box on the market being worth

1125
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:26,515
Speaker 5:  it? Richard,

1126
01:06:26,575 --> 01:06:29,755
Speaker 4:  Let me ask you this. And again, Richard and I are our old heads together.

1127
01:06:29,765 --> 01:06:33,675
Speaker 4:  We've covered a lot of home theater ideas over the years in a way

1128
01:06:33,675 --> 01:06:37,075
Speaker 4:  that I think when we're older and retired, we will just tell war stories

1129
01:06:37,665 --> 01:06:40,875
Speaker 4:  like on a porch somewhere to children who don't care. Like that's where Richard

1130
01:06:40,895 --> 01:06:44,575
Speaker 4:  and I are together on this journey. But let me ask you this, did they just

1131
01:06:44,575 --> 01:06:47,575
Speaker 4:  make a receiver? 'cause you squint at this thing and you're like, oh, it's

1132
01:06:47,575 --> 01:06:48,815
Speaker 4:  a receiver with a Roku in it.

1133
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:53,095
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's just a, an Atmos receiver that is more expensive

1134
01:06:54,155 --> 01:06:58,145
Speaker 6:  and has the apps built into it with universal search, which I'm

1135
01:06:58,145 --> 01:07:00,065
Speaker 6:  pretty sure people have tried before. Right?

1136
01:07:00,065 --> 01:07:02,385
Speaker 4:  And but, but by the way, it doesn't have any amps in it so you need to buy

1137
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:06,055
Speaker 4:  their wireless speaker, right? It's a receiver that only works with

1138
01:07:06,315 --> 01:07:08,495
Speaker 4:  one company's wireless speakers. But

1139
01:07:08,495 --> 01:07:12,375
Speaker 6:  Hasn't that been their business model basically the whole time? So to be

1140
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:12,535
Speaker 6:  fair,

1141
01:07:12,745 --> 01:07:15,615
Speaker 4:  Right, I'm just getting at, I, you know like a lot of people

1142
01:07:16,685 --> 01:07:20,575
Speaker 4:  want to plug game consoles directly into their TVs to get

1143
01:07:20,905 --> 01:07:24,295
Speaker 4:  quick media switching and VRR and whatever else you wanna get out of it,

1144
01:07:24,295 --> 01:07:28,215
Speaker 4:  right? Lower lag. Those are the

1145
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:30,695
Speaker 4:  people who do not wanna buy a receiver. 'cause you don't want to pass through

1146
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:34,055
Speaker 4:  and introduce the lag of a receiver and maybe downgrade your ports and blah

1147
01:07:34,055 --> 01:07:37,575
Speaker 4:  blah blah blah blah, blah blah. Putting the Sonos box there keeps you from

1148
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:41,095
Speaker 4:  plugging in directly into the tv, which is really the only thing people are

1149
01:07:41,095 --> 01:07:44,415
Speaker 4:  plugging into TVs anymore. Like maybe you have a streaming box,

1150
01:07:44,995 --> 01:07:48,775
Speaker 4:  but the reason people want high-end ht y ports on their

1151
01:07:48,915 --> 01:07:51,615
Speaker 4:  TVs is game consoles. Like at the end of the day, that's really the main

1152
01:07:51,615 --> 01:07:55,415
Speaker 4:  thing. Yeah. And so like Sonos being like, here's our soundbar, it plugs

1153
01:07:55,415 --> 01:07:58,855
Speaker 4:  into your ER port and it plays the audio, it just solves the problem already

1154
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,735
Speaker 4:  it that we should make a 400 streaming box. It's like half a receiver, but

1155
01:08:02,735 --> 01:08:06,515
Speaker 4:  not quite seems, it just seems on its face very complicated to me.

1156
01:08:06,605 --> 01:08:09,915
Speaker 4:  Especially when I don't know if they can fix the user interface in a specific

1157
01:08:09,915 --> 01:08:11,515
Speaker 4:  way that they're claiming to fix the user interface.

1158
01:08:12,335 --> 01:08:14,915
Speaker 5:  The reason I'm skeptical of the user interface is because this is the promise

1159
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:18,485
Speaker 5:  that everybody makes. Yes. Everybody who makes one of these things

1160
01:08:18,755 --> 01:08:22,645
Speaker 5:  says we have solved content discovery and no one solves content

1161
01:08:22,645 --> 01:08:26,565
Speaker 5:  discovery. I will say I've become a huge fan of the Google TV

1162
01:08:26,565 --> 01:08:29,805
Speaker 5:  streamer, which I think does a better job of smooshing all the stuff together

1163
01:08:29,835 --> 01:08:33,805
Speaker 5:  than almost anybody. And even it does a shit job of it because this

1164
01:08:33,805 --> 01:08:36,565
Speaker 5:  stuff gets delayed. It's not able to get that stuff in real time from the

1165
01:08:36,685 --> 01:08:39,605
Speaker 5:  services that you're watching. It always updates in wacky ways. And I'm like,

1166
01:08:39,605 --> 01:08:43,005
Speaker 5:  I don't wanna, what my kid is watching on YouTube in the morning does not

1167
01:08:43,005 --> 01:08:45,405
Speaker 5:  need to be the first thing that appears on my television when I turn it on

1168
01:08:45,665 --> 01:08:49,445
Speaker 5:  at night. Like, this stuff is hard. So I'm like, I'm not, I don't say this

1169
01:08:49,445 --> 01:08:52,285
Speaker 5:  to denigrate any of these companies. This is hard and there are a million

1170
01:08:52,645 --> 01:08:55,925
Speaker 5:  conflicting interests in it, but everybody always says they've solved it.

1171
01:08:56,625 --> 01:09:00,285
Speaker 5:  And so Sonos, which again, not famously

1172
01:09:00,565 --> 01:09:02,605
Speaker 5:  fabulous at building user interfaces and software.

1173
01:09:04,365 --> 01:09:08,235
Speaker 5:  I just, I I hope they're telling the truth, but I'm not gonna

1174
01:09:08,235 --> 01:09:08,555
Speaker 5:  believe it.

1175
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:12,475
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I dunno man. We'll, we'll see, like I said, we're Tom's a smart guy.

1176
01:09:13,295 --> 01:09:17,035
Speaker 4:  He is. Obviously he's made cuts. Hopefully they can fix the app, but this

1177
01:09:17,035 --> 01:09:20,875
Speaker 4:  is one where you've gotta do something that's so much better to

1178
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:24,645
Speaker 4:  get people outta the ecosystems they're already in, especially when Rokus

1179
01:09:24,645 --> 01:09:28,285
Speaker 4:  are basically free and whatever software's coming on your ties frame TV is

1180
01:09:28,285 --> 01:09:29,005
Speaker 4:  already free.

1181
01:09:30,635 --> 01:09:33,925
Speaker 5:  There's also some reporting in Chris's story that this thing is actually

1182
01:09:33,925 --> 01:09:37,365
Speaker 5:  a little bit divisive inside of Sonos. There are a bunch of people who think

1183
01:09:37,665 --> 01:09:41,605
Speaker 5:  making an extremely expensive streaming service or an

1184
01:09:41,605 --> 01:09:45,545
Speaker 5:  extremely expensive streaming box is not the right thing for Sonos to

1185
01:09:45,545 --> 01:09:49,185
Speaker 5:  be doing right now. Which after making an extremely expensive pair of

1186
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,015
Speaker 5:  headphones seems like a reasonable argument to make.

1187
01:09:52,395 --> 01:09:55,335
Speaker 4:  I'm just surprised this thing isn't a soundbar unto itself. I think if it

1188
01:09:55,335 --> 01:09:59,175
Speaker 4:  was the soundbar, you would, you could make some different arguments, but

1189
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:02,815
Speaker 4:  you have to buy this and the Sonos soundbar, it starts to get really complicated,

1190
01:10:02,815 --> 01:10:04,535
Speaker 4:  especially at $400. That's

1191
01:10:04,535 --> 01:10:07,535
Speaker 5:  A good point. I think the, the Roku soundbar,

1192
01:10:08,695 --> 01:10:11,575
Speaker 5:  I know a bunch of people who have it, including my in-laws and it's a big

1193
01:10:11,575 --> 01:10:14,335
Speaker 5:  hit with people who, it's just like you just plug the thing in and it instantly

1194
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:17,095
Speaker 5:  makes everything about your TV a little bit better. Like it's a pretty good

1195
01:10:17,115 --> 01:10:20,175
Speaker 5:  win. But that's also not Sonos game. Sonos is not

1196
01:10:21,465 --> 01:10:25,295
Speaker 5:  doing the like plug this thing into your TV and it's super easy

1197
01:10:25,435 --> 01:10:29,375
Speaker 5:  and it just works and it's fine thing. And so I just, I don't

1198
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,615
Speaker 5:  know, I kind of can't figure out what Sonos angle is here and why this would

1199
01:10:32,615 --> 01:10:36,255
Speaker 5:  work. But again, I hope I'm wrong. Like what it's describing is the set top

1200
01:10:36,255 --> 01:10:38,455
Speaker 5:  box that I want. So hopefully it is that. Yeah,

1201
01:10:38,535 --> 01:10:42,455
Speaker 4:  I mean I look, I I love a dumb TV gadget again, my shirt. I'd

1202
01:10:42,455 --> 01:10:43,135
Speaker 4:  been through a lot of this.

1203
01:10:43,465 --> 01:10:46,375
Speaker 5:  Sonos should have just built a television, right? We're in agreement on this.

1204
01:10:46,605 --> 01:10:50,535
Speaker 4:  They, maybe everyone should just build a TV because the TV market right now

1205
01:10:50,535 --> 01:10:51,295
Speaker 4:  is bananas.

1206
01:10:53,005 --> 01:10:55,975
Speaker 4:  It's, it's bananas. And David, you need to buy a new one. And we can talk

1207
01:10:55,975 --> 01:10:59,855
Speaker 4:  about that later. All right, I'm gonna segue from this version of

1208
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:03,455
Speaker 4:  streaming, this streaming conversation into our new segment. Brendan Carr

1209
01:11:03,455 --> 01:11:04,855
Speaker 4:  is a dummy. I'm gonna do it seamlessly.

1210
01:11:06,785 --> 01:11:10,635
Speaker 4:  Alright. TV industry under a lot of pressure, lots of

1211
01:11:10,835 --> 01:11:14,485
Speaker 4:  consolidation, lots of deals being done. CBS

1212
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:18,525
Speaker 4:  Paramount desperately wants to sell itself to a company called Skydance,

1213
01:11:18,935 --> 01:11:22,585
Speaker 4:  owned by Larry Ellison's son, the Trump

1214
01:11:22,585 --> 01:11:26,385
Speaker 4:  administration putting pressure on this deal. And in

1215
01:11:26,385 --> 01:11:29,305
Speaker 4:  particular, the pressure has come in from our friend Brendan Carr.

1216
01:11:29,655 --> 01:11:33,465
Speaker 5:  That was less of a segue than like a free association slam

1217
01:11:33,465 --> 01:11:36,745
Speaker 5:  poetry kind of thing. You just did, but I liked it. It's a group of Amy come.

1218
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:37,705
Speaker 5:  I'm into it. Yeah,

1219
01:11:38,225 --> 01:11:42,065
Speaker 4:  I I I brought you home. All right. To our new segment, Brendan

1220
01:11:42,095 --> 01:11:44,425
Speaker 4:  Carr is a dummy and the biggest threat to the First Amendment this country

1221
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:44,905
Speaker 4:  currently faces.

1222
01:11:44,965 --> 01:11:47,825
Speaker 5:  If you would like to compose theme music to this segment, I will play it

1223
01:11:47,825 --> 01:11:50,025
Speaker 5:  every single time. I, I promise Brendan,

1224
01:11:50,025 --> 01:11:52,905
Speaker 4:  If you're listening, just know you're welcome on decoder anytime

1225
01:11:54,065 --> 01:11:57,895
Speaker 4:  it'll be a good time. Alright, so Brendan Carr putting pressure on this

1226
01:11:57,895 --> 01:12:01,655
Speaker 4:  deal saying the FCC is allowed to review the sale of CBS because CBS owns

1227
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:04,375
Speaker 4:  some broadcast licenses for some of its stations, not all of its stations,

1228
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:07,575
Speaker 4:  some of its stations. And that means they get to review some of the deal.

1229
01:12:09,085 --> 01:12:12,905
Speaker 4:  In particular, he's putting pressure on them for this interview

1230
01:12:13,205 --> 01:12:16,145
Speaker 4:  of Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes in which

1231
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:20,665
Speaker 4:  one part of an answer was aired in one part of a show. And another part of

1232
01:12:20,665 --> 01:12:24,465
Speaker 4:  an answer was aired later on CBSI think evening news. So they had one

1233
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:27,705
Speaker 4:  big interview and they chopped up the interview and aired different bits

1234
01:12:28,485 --> 01:12:29,225
Speaker 4:  in different parts,

1235
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:33,305
Speaker 5:  Which is what everyone does with every piece of content

1236
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:34,825
Speaker 5:  everywhere all the time.

1237
01:12:35,135 --> 01:12:37,185
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I dunno If you have ever watched anything.

1238
01:12:38,135 --> 01:12:41,945
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like how dare you only show this one play of the basketball game on

1239
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:44,865
Speaker 5:  Instagram. You have to show the whole game or else it's illegal.

1240
01:12:45,505 --> 01:12:49,385
Speaker 4:  I demand a full uncut Avengers

1241
01:12:49,385 --> 01:12:52,145
Speaker 4:  end game. The whole thing. I wanna see all of it.

1242
01:12:53,245 --> 01:12:56,865
Speaker 4:  And you know, deceptive editing and news is a problem. I'm not gonna shy

1243
01:12:56,865 --> 01:13:00,385
Speaker 4:  away from it, but it, it's just everywhere. You wanna see some deceptive

1244
01:13:00,385 --> 01:13:02,785
Speaker 4:  editing and news. You could watch Fox News. They do it all

1245
01:13:02,785 --> 01:13:05,065
Speaker 5:  The time. Oh, I thought you were about to do a cool thing. We'd have to edit.

1246
01:13:05,905 --> 01:13:07,145
Speaker 5:  That's all right. We'll get 'em next time.

1247
01:13:09,425 --> 01:13:12,585
Speaker 4:  I deceptively edit everything. Do you know where we're starting? Where the

1248
01:13:12,585 --> 01:13:13,305
Speaker 4:  merger is launching a phone.

1249
01:13:15,005 --> 01:13:18,865
Speaker 4:  So he's putting all this pressure on CBS. He says it's news distortion.

1250
01:13:18,865 --> 01:13:22,785
Speaker 4:  The Trump administration has sued CBS for $10 billion. I would

1251
01:13:22,785 --> 01:13:26,665
Speaker 4:  remind all of you that they are the winners. They, they won the election

1252
01:13:26,685 --> 01:13:29,785
Speaker 4:  and they are currently in power. And so this is just some pure sore winner

1253
01:13:29,785 --> 01:13:30,105
Speaker 4:  stuff.

1254
01:13:31,845 --> 01:13:35,665
Speaker 4:  But CBS wants to sell itself. They want to make this deal.

1255
01:13:35,765 --> 01:13:39,465
Speaker 4:  So instead of doing what their newsroom wants them to do, which is

1256
01:13:39,855 --> 01:13:43,705
Speaker 4:  ferociously fight a government speech regulation and

1257
01:13:43,705 --> 01:13:46,985
Speaker 4:  government overreach into protected editorial speech, which is what they

1258
01:13:46,985 --> 01:13:50,545
Speaker 4:  should do. That's just some First Amendment stuff. You're a government speech

1259
01:13:50,545 --> 01:13:54,065
Speaker 4:  regulator. You show up to a newsroom, the newsroom should say F off.

1260
01:13:55,105 --> 01:13:58,755
Speaker 4:  This is what you should do that And people do it all the time. Nope,

1261
01:13:58,755 --> 01:14:02,515
Speaker 4:  they're gonna roll. So they gave the full unedited interview to the

1262
01:14:02,555 --> 01:14:06,515
Speaker 4:  FCC Brendan Carr published it and now of course right wing grifters are seizing

1263
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:10,395
Speaker 4:  on the dumbest stuff to quote unquote prove that the thing was edited. Even

1264
01:14:10,395 --> 01:14:14,245
Speaker 4:  though you can see for yourself, CBS ran the first part of an

1265
01:14:14,245 --> 01:14:17,485
Speaker 4:  answer in one show and the second part of an answer in another show. And

1266
01:14:17,485 --> 01:14:19,725
Speaker 4:  it was just a long answer and they just picked the answer they thought was

1267
01:14:19,725 --> 01:14:22,405
Speaker 4:  most relevant to those audiences. But now you have it, you can see it,

1268
01:14:22,945 --> 01:14:26,165
Speaker 5:  You could ironically argue that that's actually good journalism because they

1269
01:14:26,165 --> 01:14:30,125
Speaker 5:  ran the whole answer. Because you get to see more of the

1270
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:30,605
Speaker 5:  answer than

1271
01:14:30,605 --> 01:14:33,685
Speaker 4:  You would I think you can be very critical of CBS for not making it clear

1272
01:14:33,955 --> 01:14:37,285
Speaker 4:  that this was one long answer and they cut it and then getting caught and

1273
01:14:37,285 --> 01:14:40,645
Speaker 4:  then like being shady about like I I do think there was some weirdness there

1274
01:14:40,645 --> 01:14:44,125
Speaker 4:  from CBS. Okay. I do think the, Hey, we had a long conversation. We ran some

1275
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:48,045
Speaker 4:  part of the answers. You can read any profile of any famous person in any

1276
01:14:48,325 --> 01:14:51,405
Speaker 4:  magazine and they're only running the parts of the answers that are relevant

1277
01:14:51,405 --> 01:14:55,165
Speaker 4:  to the story that is being told on profile it's reality. Yeah. Right. In

1278
01:14:55,165 --> 01:14:58,685
Speaker 4:  60 Minutes in particular, it's not like a podcast, right. They're like

1279
01:14:58,685 --> 01:15:02,605
Speaker 4:  tightly edited little story packages. They're very good. They're, they're

1280
01:15:02,605 --> 01:15:06,445
Speaker 4:  famous for them. CBS 60 Minutes also not famously a bastion of like

1281
01:15:07,115 --> 01:15:10,645
Speaker 4:  wild leftist ideas. It's a news magazine for old people. Yeah,

1282
01:15:10,945 --> 01:15:12,485
Speaker 4:  it is a very conservative program

1283
01:15:12,785 --> 01:15:16,605
Speaker 5:  But also like as as journalistically buttoned up as any organization you

1284
01:15:16,605 --> 01:15:17,205
Speaker 5:  will find anywhere.

1285
01:15:17,385 --> 01:15:21,205
Speaker 4:  Yep. So that's one. So he's pressuring CBS and CBS is caving

1286
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:25,125
Speaker 4:  because Paramount wants to make a deal with Skydance. Very

1287
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:28,725
Speaker 4:  dangerous. Like I don't, I actually don't care what your politics are.

1288
01:15:29,355 --> 01:15:33,165
Speaker 4:  That is First Amendment fire territory. Right? You just don't want the government

1289
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:34,405
Speaker 4:  interfering with speech in this way

1290
01:15:35,945 --> 01:15:39,005
Speaker 4:  and the idea that because they have a broadcast license that Brendan Carr

1291
01:15:39,005 --> 01:15:42,085
Speaker 4:  can invent some public in. No, you just don't do it. We haven't done it for

1292
01:15:42,135 --> 01:15:46,005
Speaker 4:  years. For years Republicans and Democrats

1293
01:15:46,015 --> 01:15:49,525
Speaker 4:  alike have said this should not be the business. The FCC. The FCC should

1294
01:15:49,525 --> 01:15:52,715
Speaker 4:  be in the business of getting people connected to the internet. And we're

1295
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:55,115
Speaker 4:  not doing that anymore. We're doing, we're gonna go interfere with CBS's

1296
01:15:55,115 --> 01:15:58,315
Speaker 4:  speech 'cause they wanna make a merger weird all the way around. Weird. Do

1297
01:15:58,315 --> 01:16:01,795
Speaker 4:  not trade the first Amendment for a merger. It's not gonna work anyway. By

1298
01:16:01,795 --> 01:16:05,555
Speaker 4:  the way, you're already at 80 on the go 90 scale. Yeah. Like horrible second

1299
01:16:05,555 --> 01:16:09,435
Speaker 4:  Brendan Carr same deal started an investigation this

1300
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:12,995
Speaker 4:  week into KCBS 7:40 AM in San Francisco

1301
01:16:13,145 --> 01:16:16,955
Speaker 4:  because their news program reported on the location

1302
01:16:16,975 --> 01:16:20,835
Speaker 4:  of an ice raid in San Jose. So they said we're we're

1303
01:16:20,835 --> 01:16:23,715
Speaker 4:  reporting we, there's an ice raid going on, we see this thing is happening,

1304
01:16:24,215 --> 01:16:27,595
Speaker 4:  here's the cars or whatever. And he said, oh you're interfering with immigration.

1305
01:16:27,595 --> 01:16:31,115
Speaker 4:  We're gonna investigate your broadcast license. I'll tell you right now,

1306
01:16:31,245 --> 01:16:33,915
Speaker 4:  every single day on social media, people are telling you where their ice

1307
01:16:33,915 --> 01:16:37,515
Speaker 4:  raids. Yeah. It's just happening on every on x whatever platform you want.

1308
01:16:37,515 --> 01:16:40,675
Speaker 4:  This is happening because it is a public interest that this is happening

1309
01:16:40,975 --> 01:16:44,395
Speaker 4:  and it is in fact happening. So to go into a news

1310
01:16:44,395 --> 01:16:47,835
Speaker 4:  organization and say you are interfering with law enforcement and that's

1311
01:16:47,835 --> 01:16:51,795
Speaker 4:  somehow a crime that should lead to the FCC investigating your spectrum

1312
01:16:51,795 --> 01:16:55,035
Speaker 4:  license another five alarm First Amendment fire.

1313
01:16:55,365 --> 01:16:58,715
Speaker 4:  Especially when the exact same content distributed on social media.

1314
01:16:59,525 --> 01:17:03,145
Speaker 4:  Not he can't, he has, he can't say anything about it. This is just Brendan

1315
01:17:03,605 --> 01:17:07,345
Speaker 4:  who has some power, who's invented a new way of using power because he doles

1316
01:17:07,345 --> 01:17:11,045
Speaker 4:  out broadcast licenses to say I can interfere with speech

1317
01:17:12,105 --> 01:17:15,525
Speaker 4:  and I promise you he is coming for the internet. He's not gonna be done here

1318
01:17:15,525 --> 01:17:19,245
Speaker 4:  with the broadcast companies. He's gonna find out if this

1319
01:17:19,255 --> 01:17:23,185
Speaker 4:  works. If I've doled out a broadcast license and I can

1320
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:26,385
Speaker 4:  go interfere with speech and chill news organizations, he's gonna find out

1321
01:17:26,385 --> 01:17:30,145
Speaker 4:  if it works. And then he will invent a way to say the

1322
01:17:30,265 --> 01:17:34,025
Speaker 4:  FCC should look at the content being distributed by internet service

1323
01:17:34,265 --> 01:17:36,985
Speaker 4:  providers. And it is already happening in a variety of ways. They've tried

1324
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:40,425
Speaker 4:  it several times. SOPA and pep. We don't want copyright infringement, we

1325
01:17:40,425 --> 01:17:44,065
Speaker 4:  don't want pornography, we want the kids online safety. We're gonna

1326
01:17:44,135 --> 01:17:48,025
Speaker 4:  find some hook for the first amendment to come and regulate the concept

1327
01:17:48,025 --> 01:17:51,545
Speaker 4:  of internet service Section two 30, Brendan too hard. The author

1328
01:17:51,965 --> 01:17:55,905
Speaker 4:  of the project 2025 chapter on the FCC says the FCC should

1329
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:59,505
Speaker 4:  just reinterpret section two 30 for the courts to give him power over

1330
01:17:59,745 --> 01:18:03,705
Speaker 4:  internet providers. All this stuff. You might not care about 60

1331
01:18:03,705 --> 01:18:06,625
Speaker 4:  minutes, you might not care about some AM radio station. These are all little

1332
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:10,425
Speaker 4:  trial balloons to see if Brendan Carr can meet the speech police for the

1333
01:18:10,425 --> 01:18:10,585
Speaker 4:  country.

1334
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:16,185
Speaker 4:  And can I just say, while he is doing all this in the background, he's putting

1335
01:18:16,245 --> 01:18:20,065
Speaker 4:  out blog posts that are super friendly, full of jokes about how he's a chiefs

1336
01:18:20,065 --> 01:18:23,825
Speaker 4:  fan saying his this is real. He, he released a blog post this week saying

1337
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:27,745
Speaker 4:  his biggest priority was a rulemaking to see if there

1338
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:31,505
Speaker 4:  are steps the FCC can take to make sure TV viewers aren't inundated by

1339
01:18:31,505 --> 01:18:33,305
Speaker 4:  exceedingly loud TV commercials.

1340
01:18:35,015 --> 01:18:38,355
Speaker 5:  Oh no, this is a real like worst person, you know. Makes a good point kind

1341
01:18:38,355 --> 01:18:41,635
Speaker 5:  of thing though. Like I do agree with that. I taking a nap the other day

1342
01:18:41,635 --> 01:18:43,835
Speaker 5:  and a commercial woke me up and I was like pretty annoyed by it.

1343
01:18:43,855 --> 01:18:46,435
Speaker 4:  Oh and he also wants to stop spam calling, which this commission has been

1344
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:50,395
Speaker 4:  trying to do since 500 years. Yeah, they, they're not able to do it 'cause

1345
01:18:50,395 --> 01:18:54,235
Speaker 4:  they won't, 'cause the telecom companies basically own them so

1346
01:18:54,345 --> 01:18:57,755
Speaker 4:  they won't actually do anything. Like there are no spam calls in Europe or

1347
01:18:57,755 --> 01:18:59,755
Speaker 4:  the Europeans on our team are like, what are you talking about? We're like,

1348
01:18:59,755 --> 01:19:02,795
Speaker 4:  no, no, no. If you just answer a phone call, someone will steal your identity.

1349
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:06,275
Speaker 4:  That's how America is now. You have to shoot your phone when it rings.

1350
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:11,275
Speaker 4:  But it's because Europeans regulate their telecom companies and we have this

1351
01:19:11,275 --> 01:19:14,515
Speaker 4:  revolving doors of weirdos and now the biggest weirdo of all brand car.

1352
01:19:15,415 --> 01:19:19,315
Speaker 4:  I'm telling you there's a lot of bad Trump administration stuff and you

1353
01:19:19,405 --> 01:19:22,915
Speaker 4:  might hate my politics, whatever you think my politics are, but I have been

1354
01:19:23,025 --> 01:19:26,995
Speaker 4:  very consistent on this show for over a decade. The government

1355
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:30,895
Speaker 4:  speech regulations are bad. And this is, here

1356
01:19:30,895 --> 01:19:34,615
Speaker 4:  they are, they have a face, they have a name. It is Brendan Carr.

1357
01:19:34,955 --> 01:19:38,855
Speaker 4:  He is trying to pressure and news organizations using the idea that

1358
01:19:38,855 --> 01:19:42,455
Speaker 4:  the FCC can regulate the airwaves to, to regulate speech

1359
01:19:42,735 --> 01:19:46,015
Speaker 4:  directly as a trial balloon for how can the FCC regulate what's on the internet,

1360
01:19:47,005 --> 01:19:47,425
Speaker 4:  Brenda?

1361
01:19:47,445 --> 01:19:50,705
Speaker 5:  And it's also not that big a gap from one to the next. Like it doesn't, it

1362
01:19:50,705 --> 01:19:54,625
Speaker 5:  sounds like a big leap from one to the other, but it's not,

1363
01:19:54,655 --> 01:19:56,465
Speaker 5:  it's the same playbook you can run in both places.

1364
01:19:56,885 --> 01:20:00,305
Speaker 4:  And meanwhile he's putting out blog posts saying he's gonna make the TV commercials

1365
01:20:00,305 --> 01:20:04,135
Speaker 4:  quieter. I'm just saying Brandon, If you wanna come Onder I know, I know

1366
01:20:04,135 --> 01:20:07,885
Speaker 4:  you listen, I pay attention. I know you Google your own name. I know this

1367
01:20:07,885 --> 01:20:11,845
Speaker 4:  because you've, I I I just know I've gotten the incoming before.

1368
01:20:12,395 --> 01:20:16,245
Speaker 4:  Come on to Cutter to try to defend this. It's indefensible this, this is

1369
01:20:16,245 --> 01:20:19,645
Speaker 4:  First Amendment on fire territory and it has a face in it. So we're gonna

1370
01:20:19,645 --> 01:20:23,445
Speaker 4:  just do this every week unfortunately because this is very dangerous

1371
01:20:23,445 --> 01:20:27,405
Speaker 4:  stuff and I I I just think we should all be far more protective of

1372
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:29,805
Speaker 4:  the First Amendment. This especially 'cause he keeps talking about it in

1373
01:20:29,805 --> 01:20:33,795
Speaker 4:  the language of free speech. Why is he punishing CBS because

1374
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:37,105
Speaker 4:  of free speech. That makes no sense. Yeah. Okay. Sorry.

1375
01:20:37,545 --> 01:20:41,385
Speaker 5:  I can buy Brendan Carr as a dummy.com for $19 and redirect it to the first

1376
01:20:41,385 --> 01:20:41,985
Speaker 5:  cast if I

1377
01:20:41,985 --> 01:20:42,905
Speaker 4:  Don't want you to be arrested.

1378
01:20:45,045 --> 01:20:48,105
Speaker 4:  That's how you get arrested. Alright. Sorry. This is supposed be a lightning

1379
01:20:48,105 --> 01:20:48,305
Speaker 4:  round.

1380
01:20:49,985 --> 01:20:52,915
Speaker 4:  Richard, what's your lightning round item? I'll, I'll stop dunking on Brendan

1381
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:53,115
Speaker 4:  now.

1382
01:20:53,135 --> 01:20:55,315
Speaker 6:  Oh, my favorite story of the week, dummy opening as new logo.

1383
01:20:58,135 --> 01:20:58,635
Speaker 4:  No, Richard,

1384
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:03,915
Speaker 4:  can I tell you, so we published, start out the new logo and I'll let Richard

1385
01:21:04,355 --> 01:21:06,595
Speaker 4:  describe it. We got a bunch of commenters being like, this is clickbait.

1386
01:21:06,635 --> 01:21:07,835
Speaker 4:  I don't know what you're talking about.

1387
01:21:10,355 --> 01:21:12,495
Speaker 4:  Is that real? 'cause you real can't tell super real.

1388
01:21:12,845 --> 01:21:16,655
Speaker 6:  They're like, we changed like, like we had a dis we had a long

1389
01:21:16,655 --> 01:21:17,535
Speaker 6:  discussion in New

1390
01:21:17,535 --> 01:21:17,735
Speaker 4:  Room

1391
01:21:18,235 --> 01:21:22,055
Speaker 6:  And with me just asking what they said they

1392
01:21:22,055 --> 01:21:25,215
Speaker 6:  like and I mean specifically. So they got a new typeface,

1393
01:21:25,915 --> 01:21:29,625
Speaker 6:  OpenAI Sands. Okay, whatever fonts, typefaces,

1394
01:21:30,245 --> 01:21:33,465
Speaker 6:  you got 'em, it's, it, it's words. You, you can read it.

1395
01:21:34,145 --> 01:21:37,795
Speaker 6:  They also have that little like design that they have that

1396
01:21:37,955 --> 01:21:41,435
Speaker 6:  you're supposed to not use by itself I guess. But that little, what is it?

1397
01:21:41,435 --> 01:21:43,355
Speaker 6:  It's three triangles, interlocking, I guess

1398
01:21:43,675 --> 01:21:46,915
Speaker 4:  They're not triangles. It's, it's like a, it's their bubble. It's got a hexagon

1399
01:21:46,915 --> 01:21:47,235
Speaker 4:  in the middle.

1400
01:21:47,625 --> 01:21:50,755
Speaker 6:  They say it's triangles, but they don't line up. So they're not triangles.

1401
01:21:50,835 --> 01:21:51,795
Speaker 6:  I don't know what it's, no, they

1402
01:21:51,795 --> 01:21:54,795
Speaker 4:  Look like chain links. It's a triangles, it's a clover. It's like a clover

1403
01:21:54,795 --> 01:21:55,235
Speaker 4:  leaf field. Yeah,

1404
01:21:55,235 --> 01:21:57,755
Speaker 6:  It's a clover. Yeah, that's good. And so they cleaned it up, but they didn't

1405
01:21:57,755 --> 01:22:01,315
Speaker 6:  make it line up so that it's triangles like they say it is. So

1406
01:22:02,095 --> 01:22:04,795
Speaker 6:  If you, If you look very closely, I guess you can figure out what is different

1407
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:06,915
Speaker 6:  about it, but it looks the same. No,

1408
01:22:06,915 --> 01:22:07,155
Speaker 4:  Richard,

1409
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:10,885
Speaker 5:  Can I tell you what's different? They made the lines a little thicker. That's,

1410
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:11,205
Speaker 5:  that's

1411
01:22:11,205 --> 01:22:13,365
Speaker 4:  It. No, the lines, lines are No, no, David, the lines are thinner.

1412
01:22:14,505 --> 01:22:15,405
Speaker 6:  See, see,

1413
01:22:17,025 --> 01:22:17,485
Speaker 4:  You're right.

1414
01:22:20,785 --> 01:22:22,525
Speaker 6:  No, and that's why this is my favorite story.

1415
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:25,205
Speaker 4:  But by far, Richard, I need you

1416
01:22:25,205 --> 01:22:28,965
Speaker 5:  To describe the photo of the words in the

1417
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:29,205
Speaker 5:  sky

1418
01:22:30,555 --> 01:22:32,605
Speaker 4:  Because this is the greatest thing I've ever seen.

1419
01:22:33,065 --> 01:22:35,685
Speaker 6:  It is, I mean, it is OpenAI

1420
01:22:37,115 --> 01:22:40,775
Speaker 6:  in front of clouds taken from a mountain above the

1421
01:22:40,775 --> 01:22:44,765
Speaker 6:  clouds. Why? I don't know. This is what was in

1422
01:22:44,765 --> 01:22:48,565
Speaker 6:  their video to tell you about their new design, which I'm sure they spent

1423
01:22:48,565 --> 01:22:52,485
Speaker 6:  a lot of money on and congratulations to them for that. But

1424
01:22:52,835 --> 01:22:54,485
Speaker 6:  yeah, do you guys

1425
01:22:54,685 --> 01:22:56,285
Speaker 5:  Remember the Chairs Are Like Facebook ad?

1426
01:22:57,635 --> 01:22:58,955
Speaker 6:  I do not. You, you, you

1427
01:22:59,235 --> 01:22:59,755
Speaker 5:  Remember the chairs like

1428
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:01,275
Speaker 6:  Facebook ad. I had no clue what that was.

1429
01:23:01,275 --> 01:23:04,135
Speaker 4:  Well, what's the other way? It was Facebook was like a chair. No

1430
01:23:05,165 --> 01:23:06,145
Speaker 4:  chairs like Facebook.

1431
01:23:06,365 --> 01:23:10,065
Speaker 5:  The video is titled my friend Chairs Are Like Facebook.

1432
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:14,385
Speaker 4:  You know, it's funny that a decade later I've recognized this to make slightly

1433
01:23:14,385 --> 01:23:15,545
Speaker 4:  more sense. And you're right,

1434
01:23:15,965 --> 01:23:19,905
Speaker 5:  It is insanity. I, I'll put this link in the show notes, but it is one

1435
01:23:19,905 --> 01:23:23,825
Speaker 5:  of the most unhinged pieces of brand advertising

1436
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:27,585
Speaker 5:  I have ever seen in my entire life. It, it was, it was a

1437
01:23:28,085 --> 01:23:31,985
Speaker 5:  TV commercial that Facebook came out with in I think 2012 when it hit a billion

1438
01:23:31,995 --> 01:23:35,825
Speaker 5:  users that literally compared chairs

1439
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:40,425
Speaker 5:  to Facebook. And it is, it is like an ayahuasca trip of

1440
01:23:40,605 --> 01:23:44,505
Speaker 5:  an advertis, an advertising plan. And it's insane. And

1441
01:23:44,505 --> 01:23:46,985
Speaker 5:  this is what this made me think of because Richard, in addition to the one

1442
01:23:46,985 --> 01:23:50,905
Speaker 5:  you just described, there's another image in which a bunch of

1443
01:23:50,915 --> 01:23:54,425
Speaker 5:  words are just randomly superimposed on a like

1444
01:23:54,425 --> 01:23:57,785
Speaker 5:  California mountain thing and it just says artificial general

1445
01:23:57,785 --> 01:24:01,505
Speaker 5:  intelligence that benefits all of humanity.

1446
01:24:01,815 --> 01:24:03,385
Speaker 5:  Also, they didn't use AI to

1447
01:24:03,385 --> 01:24:03,985
Speaker 4:  Design this.

1448
01:24:04,655 --> 01:24:07,475
Speaker 5:  Yes. Yeah. Which is absurd. Like have some faith in your own products, people

1449
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:07,835
Speaker 5:  come on.

1450
01:24:08,065 --> 01:24:10,955
Speaker 4:  Okay. It's one thing I wanna say and I will leave this as a puzzle for the

1451
01:24:11,155 --> 01:24:11,995
Speaker 4:  listener. It's so

1452
01:24:11,995 --> 01:24:12,195
Speaker 5:  Good.

1453
01:24:12,775 --> 01:24:15,795
Speaker 4:  The lines in the clover are both thicker and thinner.

1454
01:24:17,835 --> 01:24:21,575
Speaker 4:  And I will allow you, everyone can go evaluate what that means on themselves,

1455
01:24:21,635 --> 01:24:24,655
Speaker 4:  but it's true, they're both thicker and thinner. So David, you were half

1456
01:24:24,655 --> 01:24:24,855
Speaker 5:  Right,

1457
01:24:25,585 --> 01:24:26,405
Speaker 4:  But not all the right and

1458
01:24:26,405 --> 01:24:29,245
Speaker 5:  That makes me angrier. Like I like that less than what I was just wrong.

1459
01:24:30,205 --> 01:24:30,805
Speaker 5:  I don't like this.

1460
01:24:31,225 --> 01:24:34,445
Speaker 4:  The other piece of the puzzle here that I is just funny if you're a design

1461
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:38,355
Speaker 4:  nerd is like all rebrands, they have a custom font, you know, it's like

1462
01:24:38,355 --> 01:24:41,315
Speaker 4:  all the stuff they're doing. It's called OpenAI sands, all, all whatever.

1463
01:24:41,505 --> 01:24:45,435
Speaker 4:  They announced it in wallpaper with like the usual words

1464
01:24:45,575 --> 01:24:48,435
Speaker 4:  of we made a design system and now we have to pretend that it means something

1465
01:24:48,435 --> 01:24:52,035
Speaker 4:  like it's more organic and more human. But it's funny that they announced

1466
01:24:52,035 --> 01:24:55,995
Speaker 4:  in wallpaper because wallpaper is where Johnny, ive has always gone to

1467
01:24:55,995 --> 01:24:59,635
Speaker 4:  talk about design and apple's designers have always gone to talk about design

1468
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:03,635
Speaker 4:  and like, If you wanna read long stories about the Apple

1469
01:25:03,635 --> 01:25:07,195
Speaker 4:  design lab in which nothing is said like wallpaper is for you. It's, it's,

1470
01:25:07,315 --> 01:25:11,035
Speaker 4:  I love like I want to Yeah, I'm saying with all sincerity, I love it and

1471
01:25:11,035 --> 01:25:13,435
Speaker 4:  I want them to publish that every day so I can read it because I will just

1472
01:25:13,435 --> 01:25:16,635
Speaker 4:  take it in. I like, I love it with all my heart, but it's, it's not, there's

1473
01:25:16,835 --> 01:25:20,355
Speaker 4:  nothing, there's never anything in there. Yeah. But Johnny, ive

1474
01:25:20,665 --> 01:25:24,155
Speaker 4:  working famously with Sam Altman on some weird OpenAI hardware device.

1475
01:25:24,775 --> 01:25:28,595
Speaker 4:  So OpenAI doing a big rebrand and talking in all these design words

1476
01:25:28,595 --> 01:25:32,215
Speaker 4:  about why they're more human and announcing in wallpaper. That's a lot of

1477
01:25:32,215 --> 01:25:36,145
Speaker 4:  Johnny Ive and also a bunch of other Apple designers

1478
01:25:36,145 --> 01:25:39,865
Speaker 4:  now at OpenAI. So yes, Richard, it is very silly. But there's,

1479
01:25:40,855 --> 01:25:44,025
Speaker 4:  there's just a little evidence here that, you know, there's some Johnny I

1480
01:25:44,025 --> 01:25:46,985
Speaker 4:  in the mix, by the way, OpenAI also announced deep research this week, their

1481
01:25:46,985 --> 01:25:49,745
Speaker 4:  actual product, not just a weird logo with lines that are both thicker and

1482
01:25:49,745 --> 01:25:51,185
Speaker 4:  thinner than the old logo. Have you used it at all?

1483
01:25:51,895 --> 01:25:55,425
Speaker 5:  Only in tiny bits and pieces so far. I got it. I got the

1484
01:25:55,425 --> 01:25:58,865
Speaker 5:  $200 a month Chad, GBT mostly so I can test operator

1485
01:25:59,465 --> 01:26:02,185
Speaker 5:  about which I have many feelings that I'm, I'm not ready to talk about yet

1486
01:26:02,185 --> 01:26:05,205
Speaker 5:  because it will send me down a rabbit hole I'm not ready for. But

1487
01:26:06,425 --> 01:26:10,285
Speaker 5:  it, it's, it's really good. I mean it's, it's a huge leap

1488
01:26:10,285 --> 01:26:14,205
Speaker 5:  towards, again, what if we let these things be slow

1489
01:26:14,945 --> 01:26:18,485
Speaker 5:  and kind of confusing and convoluted in the name of making them better.

1490
01:26:19,065 --> 01:26:22,845
Speaker 5:  And I think in a really interesting way that is not

1491
01:26:22,945 --> 01:26:26,885
Speaker 5:  how most people make product that, like if everybody just said,

1492
01:26:26,885 --> 01:26:28,205
Speaker 5:  what if we made our apps slower?

1493
01:26:29,845 --> 01:26:33,805
Speaker 5:  A lot of things might get better, but also people wouldn't do it. But

1494
01:26:33,805 --> 01:26:37,365
Speaker 5:  I think OpenAI is like on this interesting push towards what if,

1495
01:26:37,555 --> 01:26:41,205
Speaker 5:  what if this stuff is actually like useful and

1496
01:26:41,215 --> 01:26:44,005
Speaker 5:  tells the truth? And there are a lot of people out there who are, are using

1497
01:26:44,005 --> 01:26:47,965
Speaker 5:  it for really complicated research things who are impressed with what they're

1498
01:26:47,965 --> 01:26:51,925
Speaker 5:  getting. So I think there's something here, it appears to be very slow

1499
01:26:51,945 --> 01:26:55,845
Speaker 5:  and very expensive to run. So I don't know what

1500
01:26:55,845 --> 01:26:59,805
Speaker 5:  to make of that exactly. But, but the idea that you can do things

1501
01:26:59,805 --> 01:27:03,605
Speaker 5:  that make these systems work better appears to be true,

1502
01:27:03,845 --> 01:27:04,645
Speaker 5:  I think is really interesting.

1503
01:27:04,715 --> 01:27:06,845
Speaker 4:  Well this is why Sam Altman needs $500 billion,

1504
01:27:07,295 --> 01:27:10,925
Speaker 5:  Right? Well, and this is like the, I think the great deep seek legacy

1505
01:27:11,115 --> 01:27:14,895
Speaker 5:  will be pushing everybody towards, oh, what if these things were better?

1506
01:27:16,805 --> 01:27:19,335
Speaker 5:  What If you tried harder? I mean it's like what you said on the show last

1507
01:27:19,335 --> 01:27:23,095
Speaker 5:  week, NELI, right? Like there's this fundamental idea that all we have to

1508
01:27:23,095 --> 01:27:26,935
Speaker 5:  do is throw more compute at it and it'll ev it'll eventually

1509
01:27:26,935 --> 01:27:30,815
Speaker 5:  all work itself out. Like the scaling laws will fix it. And I

1510
01:27:30,815 --> 01:27:33,135
Speaker 5:  think pretty quickly everyone has come around to like, no, we actually need

1511
01:27:33,135 --> 01:27:36,895
Speaker 5:  some new ideas here. Yeah. And we're starting to see the fruits of that

1512
01:27:36,895 --> 01:27:37,455
Speaker 5:  really fast.

1513
01:27:38,015 --> 01:27:41,655
Speaker 4:  I, I've done a little bit of playing with the research tool and man, you

1514
01:27:41,655 --> 01:27:45,615
Speaker 4:  know, it's still, it's based on searching the open web and

1515
01:27:45,615 --> 01:27:48,375
Speaker 4:  it, it's like, I just don't, I just don't trust any AI tool. It's like, I

1516
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:50,935
Speaker 4:  learned this on the internet. It's like that

1517
01:27:50,955 --> 01:27:53,495
Speaker 5:  Is a real question of like, how useful is this to me? Because I still have

1518
01:27:53,495 --> 01:27:57,485
Speaker 5:  to go fact check everything it came up with. But yeah, there's,

1519
01:27:57,485 --> 01:28:01,085
Speaker 5:  there's something, I don't know, I'm still struck by how many of our listeners

1520
01:28:01,085 --> 01:28:02,365
Speaker 5:  we were like, I don't care if it's wrong sometimes.

1521
01:28:02,675 --> 01:28:05,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah, there's that. I will say another funny superb bowl note,

1522
01:28:06,835 --> 01:28:10,805
Speaker 4:  Richard, this week you sent an email to a professor of cheese science.

1523
01:28:11,345 --> 01:28:12,885
Speaker 4:  Can you explain what's going on here? Yes.

1524
01:28:13,765 --> 01:28:16,645
Speaker 6:  So the thing that Google is doing for their AI ads for the Super Bowl, they've

1525
01:28:16,645 --> 01:28:20,325
Speaker 6:  got like one for each state. So it's like whatever your state's big

1526
01:28:20,565 --> 01:28:24,125
Speaker 6:  business is, your marquee business. And of course for Wisconsin Cheese,

1527
01:28:24,475 --> 01:28:28,225
Speaker 6:  it's my people. And so they, they're partnering with this cheese company

1528
01:28:28,685 --> 01:28:32,545
Speaker 6:  and they're showing them using like Gemini to do whatever it is that

1529
01:28:32,545 --> 01:28:36,305
Speaker 6:  they're doing. And at one point they're generating texts for like emails

1530
01:28:36,365 --> 01:28:39,585
Speaker 6:  or something and it says something about guta and how that's like the most

1531
01:28:39,585 --> 01:28:40,425
Speaker 6:  popular cheese.

1532
01:28:41,205 --> 01:28:44,785
Speaker 4:  Now I believe it specifically claims it's 50 to 60% of the cheese in the

1533
01:28:44,785 --> 01:28:45,105
Speaker 4:  world is

1534
01:28:45,215 --> 01:28:45,505
Speaker 5:  Guta.

1535
01:28:46,335 --> 01:28:49,955
Speaker 6:  Yes. And, and someone on the internet notice that and they, they, they would

1536
01:28:49,955 --> 01:28:53,795
Speaker 6:  not let that one slide. They said, no, no, no, it's

1537
01:28:53,795 --> 01:28:57,635
Speaker 6:  not that math just doesn't work. And so

1538
01:28:57,855 --> 01:29:01,805
Speaker 6:  we, we heard about this, we looked into it, this was the subject of a

1539
01:29:01,805 --> 01:29:05,245
Speaker 6:  long write a thread like 10 years ago, people, 10 years ago, this exact question

1540
01:29:05,555 --> 01:29:09,485
Speaker 6:  from the same exact website that the Gemini seemed to have gotten

1541
01:29:09,485 --> 01:29:13,405
Speaker 6:  this answer from perfect completely unsourced other, other than this

1542
01:29:13,995 --> 01:29:15,405
Speaker 6:  kind of spammy website. Was it

1543
01:29:15,405 --> 01:29:17,285
Speaker 4:  Like cheese fax.com? Yes.

1544
01:29:17,715 --> 01:29:21,525
Speaker 6:  Because of it was, it was like cheese.com or something like that. Something

1545
01:29:21,595 --> 01:29:25,445
Speaker 6:  very SEO on point. And they've got like a page

1546
01:29:25,445 --> 01:29:28,565
Speaker 6:  about each cheese and every cheese is the most popular on its page.

1547
01:29:29,325 --> 01:29:29,805
Speaker 6:  Wait, wait,

1548
01:29:29,905 --> 01:29:30,325
Speaker 4:  Is that true?

1549
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:35,505
Speaker 6:  I they, they're like very carefully worded. Like If you, If you go to like

1550
01:29:36,225 --> 01:29:39,985
Speaker 6:  mozzarella it, it's, it seems like mozzarella's the most popular cheese.

1551
01:29:39,985 --> 01:29:40,785
Speaker 6:  Mm. But so

1552
01:29:42,395 --> 01:29:46,185
Speaker 4:  Every, every page on cheese.com is just gassing up different cheeses.

1553
01:29:47,045 --> 01:29:51,025
Speaker 6:  So I, I I, I said, alright, we need some experts. And I'm,

1554
01:29:51,045 --> 01:29:54,905
Speaker 6:  you know, there's like councils and, and professors who study like

1555
01:29:54,905 --> 01:29:58,625
Speaker 6:  dairy and the business of dairy. And I emailed this guy on a Friday at like

1556
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:01,705
Speaker 6:  4:40 PM you know, everyone is getting ready to go

1557
01:30:02,295 --> 01:30:06,105
Speaker 6:  basically immediately got back like six paragraphs on the cheese business

1558
01:30:06,365 --> 01:30:09,505
Speaker 6:  and why Google's AI was wrong about cheese. In fact,

1559
01:30:09,725 --> 01:30:11,065
Speaker 4:  He was ready, he was in the Reddit thread.

1560
01:30:11,495 --> 01:30:14,905
Speaker 5:  Okay, this is such a total diversion from

1561
01:30:15,215 --> 01:30:18,545
Speaker 5:  what we're talking about. But I'm now on cheese.com and

1562
01:30:19,255 --> 01:30:22,865
Speaker 5:  like we talk about like PhD thesis of internet

1563
01:30:22,865 --> 01:30:26,785
Speaker 5:  websites, go to cheese.com/cheddar and it will describe

1564
01:30:26,785 --> 01:30:29,105
Speaker 5:  to you everything about how the internet works.

1565
01:30:30,335 --> 01:30:34,185
Speaker 5:  There's an H two, which is a signal to Google of what's important. What is

1566
01:30:34,305 --> 01:30:37,425
Speaker 5:  cheddar cheese? Why is cheddar orange? The answer is cheddar cheese is a

1567
01:30:37,425 --> 01:30:40,105
Speaker 5:  popular type of cheese that originated in the village of cheddar in Somerset,

1568
01:30:40,105 --> 01:30:43,705
Speaker 5:  England. It is known for its distinct flavor, versatility and vibrant orange

1569
01:30:43,705 --> 01:30:47,465
Speaker 5:  color. Bunch of that's already not true. In this article, we will explore

1570
01:30:47,465 --> 01:30:49,825
Speaker 5:  what cheddar cheese is made of it's taste, shelf life, nutritional value,

1571
01:30:49,825 --> 01:30:53,765
Speaker 5:  and its origins. And there's one of these for every kind of cheese.

1572
01:30:54,435 --> 01:30:58,205
Speaker 5:  This poor Ian Jackson who wrote this and I think is

1573
01:30:58,205 --> 01:31:01,445
Speaker 5:  maybe a real person I don't know, has written an alarming number of these,

1574
01:31:01,875 --> 01:31:02,925
Speaker 5:  this is blowing my mind,

1575
01:31:03,425 --> 01:31:06,485
Speaker 4:  I'm sorry. On cheese.com. You can embark on a cheese adventure by exploring

1576
01:31:06,485 --> 01:31:10,245
Speaker 4:  the database of 2048 different types of cheese. You can also buy cheese

1577
01:31:10,245 --> 01:31:13,795
Speaker 4:  gifts and make someone happy. I love this website. That's all I'm saying.

1578
01:31:13,795 --> 01:31:17,075
Speaker 4:  And I understand why the robot was like, screw it, 50 to 60% of the world's

1579
01:31:17,075 --> 01:31:20,235
Speaker 4:  cheese is gda. Anyway, so Richard, you got an email back. What'd the email

1580
01:31:20,255 --> 01:31:20,475
Speaker 4:  say?

1581
01:31:20,705 --> 01:31:24,675
Speaker 6:  Basically, it's hard to say with the most popular cheeses because,

1582
01:31:25,755 --> 01:31:28,855
Speaker 6:  and also we were speaking to our, our, our colleagues from Europe again,

1583
01:31:29,235 --> 01:31:32,095
Speaker 6:  who have a very different opinion of cheese and, and wanted to make sure

1584
01:31:32,095 --> 01:31:34,455
Speaker 6:  that everyone knows that American cheese is apparently not cheese.

1585
01:31:35,195 --> 01:31:37,975
Speaker 4:  Now you don't understand, we have Thomas Wicker, our our deputy editor lives

1586
01:31:37,975 --> 01:31:41,655
Speaker 4:  in the Netherlands. He lives in Amsterdam, which is where Goa's from. And

1587
01:31:41,655 --> 01:31:44,255
Speaker 4:  he was like, I don't know about gda, but I know your cheese is shit. Which

1588
01:31:44,255 --> 01:31:47,855
Speaker 4:  is just such an immediately aggro response. He

1589
01:31:47,995 --> 01:31:48,415
Speaker 5:  Europe

1590
01:31:48,525 --> 01:31:50,135
Speaker 4:  Like, bro, I wasn't even fine.

1591
01:31:50,355 --> 01:31:53,215
Speaker 6:  The temperature on this discussion went way up very quickly.

1592
01:31:54,435 --> 01:31:57,375
Speaker 6:  And, and like I didn't know that we were having an international trade war

1593
01:31:57,375 --> 01:32:00,805
Speaker 6:  on cheese and I just stepped right in the middle of this

1594
01:32:00,855 --> 01:32:04,845
Speaker 6:  completely unexpectedly. It, it, it went places. But there

1595
01:32:04,845 --> 01:32:07,965
Speaker 6:  are lots of cheeses and you know, I don't know if you've heard of like

1596
01:32:08,695 --> 01:32:12,525
Speaker 6:  other countries, but everywhere has their favorite cheese and for any, for

1597
01:32:12,525 --> 01:32:15,685
Speaker 6:  basically anyone to be 60% of the market, probably not,

1598
01:32:16,915 --> 01:32:17,395
Speaker 6:  probably. And if it

1599
01:32:17,395 --> 01:32:19,475
Speaker 5:  Was, it would definitely be mozzarella, right? Like

1600
01:32:19,985 --> 01:32:20,715
Speaker 4:  What America

1601
01:32:20,715 --> 01:32:24,675
Speaker 6:  Doing. But we don't eat as much cheese as they do appar. Apparently

1602
01:32:24,675 --> 01:32:28,635
Speaker 6:  there are countries that eat way more cheese per person than we do. So just

1603
01:32:28,745 --> 01:32:29,435
Speaker 6:  letting you know,

1604
01:32:29,575 --> 01:32:30,795
Speaker 5:  That's why they're better countries.

1605
01:32:31,015 --> 01:32:32,435
Speaker 4:  So we published this story.

1606
01:32:34,775 --> 01:32:38,075
Speaker 4:  We got a a bunch of comments like, why do you care? Which is very funny.

1607
01:32:39,455 --> 01:32:42,275
Speaker 4:  Why do you keep criticizing AI for people, for getting it wrong? People get

1608
01:32:42,275 --> 01:32:43,915
Speaker 4:  things wrong all the time, which is the new line.

1609
01:32:45,485 --> 01:32:48,985
Speaker 4:  But I will say Richard and Emma who wrote the story, this is impact journalism.

1610
01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:53,565
Speaker 4:  Google has changed the ad. They have removed the guha stat

1611
01:32:53,955 --> 01:32:55,085
Speaker 4:  from the Super Bowl ad.

1612
01:32:55,085 --> 01:32:58,405
Speaker 6:  When, when, when you watch the Super Bowl on Sunday in Wisconsin, in

1613
01:32:58,405 --> 01:32:58,685
Speaker 4:  Wisconsin,

1614
01:32:59,305 --> 01:33:01,205
Speaker 6:  You'll not be misinformed about cheese.

1615
01:33:01,765 --> 01:33:05,725
Speaker 4:  I do think Gem and I learned this from an SEO website that's designed to

1616
01:33:05,725 --> 01:33:08,645
Speaker 4:  just sell you cheese and tell you every cheese is the most popular cheese.

1617
01:33:09,435 --> 01:33:13,085
Speaker 4:  This is what I mean. It's like I just, that's their feedback loop.

1618
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:13,725
Speaker 4:  Not,

1619
01:33:13,725 --> 01:33:17,485
Speaker 5:  Not to make this bleecker than a delightful

1620
01:33:17,485 --> 01:33:21,325
Speaker 5:  cheese incident really is. But the comment we got

1621
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:24,285
Speaker 5:  from Google, from the cloud apps president Jerry Disher

1622
01:33:25,835 --> 01:33:28,965
Speaker 5:  basically says that in a way that I found really bleak. His, his response

1623
01:33:28,965 --> 01:33:32,845
Speaker 5:  was not a hallucination. Gemini is grounded in the web and users

1624
01:33:32,945 --> 01:33:35,805
Speaker 5:  can always check the results and references in this case, mul in this case,

1625
01:33:36,245 --> 01:33:40,205
Speaker 5:  multiple sites across the web include the 50 to 60% stat. So what he's

1626
01:33:40,205 --> 01:33:43,285
Speaker 5:  saying is, this is a feature, not a bug.

1627
01:33:43,805 --> 01:33:43,965
Speaker 4:  Like

1628
01:33:44,505 --> 01:33:48,405
Speaker 5:  The thing got it wrong and it's not our fault because somewhere on the

1629
01:33:48,565 --> 01:33:51,845
Speaker 5:  internet the wrong information exists and thus we cannot be blamed.

1630
01:33:51,895 --> 01:33:54,565
Speaker 4:  David, to your point, people can just say stuff, you can just, people can

1631
01:33:54,565 --> 01:33:58,525
Speaker 4:  just say things. You can just say, Guta is 50 per to 60% of the world's

1632
01:33:58,525 --> 01:34:02,165
Speaker 4:  cheese on your weird website. That gets scraped over and over again for a

1633
01:34:02,165 --> 01:34:06,135
Speaker 4:  decade. And then at the end of that, AI will say, you know

1634
01:34:06,135 --> 01:34:07,575
Speaker 4:  what? Fine. That's true.

1635
01:34:07,995 --> 01:34:11,735
Speaker 5:  Yep. People can just say things. And If you can, If you, If you build your

1636
01:34:11,735 --> 01:34:14,775
Speaker 5:  life based on everything that people say, you will, you will end up lying

1637
01:34:14,775 --> 01:34:15,295
Speaker 5:  about cheese.

1638
01:34:16,855 --> 01:34:20,485
Speaker 4:  Watch out Elon. Alright, new goal for The Verge team.

1639
01:34:20,665 --> 01:34:24,205
Speaker 4:  We have to get Elon to claim that Guta is 60% in the world's cheese

1640
01:34:24,205 --> 01:34:24,725
Speaker 4:  consumption.

1641
01:34:26,695 --> 01:34:30,435
Speaker 4:  That's it. We're, we're, we're, we're aiming real low, but I think we can

1642
01:34:30,435 --> 01:34:31,315
Speaker 4:  do this together as a team.

1643
01:34:31,675 --> 01:34:32,715
Speaker 5:  I love it. Alright,

1644
01:34:33,215 --> 01:34:37,195
Speaker 4:  That's it. I, we gotta we gotta wrap. We've, we, we've been places on this
