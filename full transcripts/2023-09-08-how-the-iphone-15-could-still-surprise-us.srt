Description: The Verge's David Pierce, Alex Cranz, Richard Lawler, and Dan Seifert discuss what to expect at Apple's iPhone 15 event, the drama behind the scenes with Disney's CEOs, and some more gadget news.

2
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,110
Speaker 4:  Hey everybody, it's Neli. I am missing the show again this week. I'm so

3
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,950
Speaker 4:  sorry. We just moved. I would describe this move as a

4
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,590
Speaker 4:  real crash landing, but we made it, Max made it to our first day of

5
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,430
Speaker 4:  kindergarten, which is a real victory for us. Anyhow, I wanted to give you

6
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,200
Speaker 4:  my two quick predictions for the Apple event. One is a

7
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,030
Speaker 4:  vibes based. I think the vibe of this iPhone event will

8
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,750
Speaker 4:  be the most different of any we've had in a long time because

9
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,610
Speaker 4:  Apple has to keep the focus on the Vision pro. Somehow

10
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,230
Speaker 4:  iPhone sales are slowing down and the only real big

11
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,150
Speaker 4:  change is U S B C, which obviously Apple does not want to talk about too

12
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,540
Speaker 4:  much. So I think the vibes at this event are just gonna be

13
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,410
Speaker 4:  different and I'm excited to go there. I'm excited to see what it's like.

14
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,310
Speaker 4:  I'm always excited to go see New Tech, but I think the vibes of this

15
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,670
Speaker 4:  event are gonna be different. So that's prediction one. Prediction two is

16
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,470
Speaker 4:  that they're gonna completely gloss over U S B C on the iPhone 15 and spend

17
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,990
Speaker 4:  a long time talking about U S B C on the iPhone

18
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,790
Speaker 4:  15 Pro because that will reportedly be a thunderbolt

19
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,590
Speaker 4:  port, which is kind of a big deal for all the camera stuff. So

20
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,350
Speaker 4:  that's my big prediction. Gloss over U S B C on the on the 15, spend time

21
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,130
Speaker 4:  on it on the 15 Pro because I think pro photographers are gonna be super

22
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,230
Speaker 4:  stoked about using this camera over Thunderbolt. Not the world's biggest

23
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,070
Speaker 4:  prediction, but You know me. I'm excited about it. Alright, I'm sorry I'm

24
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,910
Speaker 4:  not here. I gotta go back to unpacking, but I'll be at the iPhone event with

25
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,510
Speaker 4:  everybody next week and I'll be on the show next week. I promise. Come hell

26
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,950
Speaker 4:  or high water rock and

27
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:54,100
Speaker 4:  roll

28
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,590
Speaker 2:  Welcome

29
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,510
Speaker 5:  To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast with the action button. I'm

30
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,440
Speaker 5:  your friend David Pierce. We have a whole crew here. We have a lot

31
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,420
Speaker 5:  to talk about. Alex Cranz is here. Hi Alex.

32
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,420
Speaker 3:  Hi. I'm your friend. Wondering how often you think about the Roman

33
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,340
Speaker 3:  Empire?

34
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,160
Speaker 5:  Not enough now that I think about

35
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,220
Speaker 3:  It. Not enough. Yeah.

36
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,520
Speaker 5:  You know every, every once in a while, like what would Caesar do? I have,

37
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,880
Speaker 5:  I had a bracelet that says that, but You know not enough. Richard Lawler's

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,940
Speaker 5:  here. Hi Richard.

39
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,840
Speaker 6:  Hi. I saw a viral tweet about the Roman Empire not existing, and I'm choosing

40
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,700
Speaker 6:  to believe that conspiracy theory.

41
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,030
Speaker 3:  Oh, I like that one.

42
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,940
Speaker 5:  Have you guys seen the one where the, it's the picture of the pyramids and

43
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,600
Speaker 5:  it says like, this is why they couldn't move the pyramids to museum. And

44
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,310
Speaker 5:  underneath it, it's just underground. The pyramids are like several hundred

45
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,510
Speaker 5:  feet deep also.

46
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,550
Speaker 3:  They're like the Titanic iceberg.

47
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,800
Speaker 5:  It's the best thing on the internet. Dan Seaford here. Hi Dan. Hello.

48
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,420
Speaker 7:  I have no interesting quips about the Roman Empire.

49
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,760
Speaker 5:  Dan, what's your favorite conspiracy

50
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,580
Speaker 5:  theory?

51
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,040
Speaker 7:  Dan, let's not not even go there.

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,940
Speaker 5:  There's no upside to you answering that question, Dan. We're just gonna,

53
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,720
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna save you from me and we're gonna move on here. We have a lot to

54
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,560
Speaker 5:  talk about this week. Neli is still moving and still not here. And

55
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,360
Speaker 5:  please shame him publicly for continuing not to be here. We have a lot to

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,440
Speaker 5:  talk about. There's an Apple event coming up next week. We're gonna spend

57
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,380
Speaker 5:  a bunch of time talking about that. There's a bunch of gadgets this week.

58
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,560
Speaker 5:  We are like firmly in gadget season. We have new stuff from Sonos, new stuff

59
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,550
Speaker 5:  from GoPro, new stuff from Sony, all kinds of stuff. There's some crazy

60
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,480
Speaker 5:  streaming news. The Bobs are fighting at Disney and we all have

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,220
Speaker 5:  a lot of feelings about this. It's,

62
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,680
Speaker 3:  I'm so excited. It's

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,600
Speaker 5:  Possible that that segment of this show is going to be nine and a half hours

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,240
Speaker 5:  long. So apologies. And Then, we have a lightning round full of fun stuff

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,320
Speaker 5:  at the end. But let's start with Apple. So we're recording this on Thursday

66
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,240
Speaker 5:  the seventh. The event is on Tuesday the 12th. It's gonna

67
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,160
Speaker 5:  be the iPhone 15. Dan, you're going rate me your

68
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,580
Speaker 5:  level of enthusiasm for the iPhone event this year.

69
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,480
Speaker 7:  So I hear there's gonna be a new iPhone, probably a new

70
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,100
Speaker 7:  Apple watch You know. I'm excited to

71
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,060
Speaker 7:  see if they can surprise us because at this point, with

72
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,360
Speaker 7:  any of these tech events, whether it's Apple or Google or Samsung or whoever

73
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,960
Speaker 7:  it is, the leaks have kind of tell all the story. The

74
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,400
Speaker 7:  everything basically comes out and we don't really have a ton of surprises

75
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,430
Speaker 7:  going into these events. And then also, this is the

76
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,400
Speaker 7:  15th iPhone by generation. Like it's not even the 15th iPhone, it's

77
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,320
Speaker 7:  like the 17th or something. But like it's, it's like the number 15 in this

78
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,720
Speaker 7:  line. And so like really what are they going to do? That's interesting. And

79
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,340
Speaker 7:  like there's a lot of rumors of like, I'm sure we'll talk through like the

80
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,400
Speaker 7:  action button and titanium and stuff like that. But like

81
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,360
Speaker 7:  ultimately the iPhone and the Apple Watch for that matter are like

82
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,540
Speaker 7:  known products.

83
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,030
Speaker 3:  So you're not hyped for Apple. Finally,

84
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,600
Speaker 3:  finally, finally truly embracing U S B

85
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,640
Speaker 3:  C.

86
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,230
Speaker 7:  I think it's good. Yeah, I can't remember the last time I plugged a cable

87
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,660
Speaker 7:  into my phone, but it's good

88
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,680
Speaker 3:  You went all in on a MagSafe.

89
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,990
Speaker 7:  I went all in on wireless charging like 10 years ago.

90
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,410
Speaker 3:  Even for your AirPods,

91
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,960
Speaker 7:  Every service and danced house is a cheap pad. Yeah, there's just like, I'm

92
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,390
Speaker 7:  just surrounded by cheap pads. Like I'm looking at my desk and there's like

93
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,040
Speaker 7:  four right in front of me. But I mean like I think for a lot of

94
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,560
Speaker 7:  our audience, it'll be a nice convenience thing when they need to like share

95
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,880
Speaker 7:  a cable and stuff like that. But ultimately, like there have been other ways

96
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,280
Speaker 7:  to charge your phone and nobody is syncing their phone with their computer

97
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,940
Speaker 7:  anymore, which is like the other reason you plugged a phone into a cable.

98
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,640
Speaker 7:  So

99
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,600
Speaker 3:  I always forget about that and then I'll plug my phone in and it'll be like,

100
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,400
Speaker 3:  you ready to sync? And I'm like, who are you? How did you get here? Get out.

101
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,620
Speaker 3:  I don't want you.

102
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,520
Speaker 5:  So I wrote a piece this week about Lightning and it was

103
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,250
Speaker 5:  basically the assignment from Jake. Our tech editor was like

104
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,780
Speaker 5:  right about the death of the lightning port. Like was it good, was it

105
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,760
Speaker 5:  bad? How was it? And the like overwhelming feeling that I

106
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,320
Speaker 5:  got going back and watching the old announcements, talking to folks who've

107
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,980
Speaker 5:  used it, is that like lightning was very good and

108
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,880
Speaker 5:  if wireless charging had existed back then or been any good

109
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,320
Speaker 5:  at all, it never would've existed because Apple is like desperate to make

110
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,200
Speaker 5:  wireless charging the answer. Which I think is so interesting. And like there

111
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,600
Speaker 5:  was this great interview that Phil Schiller gave in 2012, right after they

112
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,480
Speaker 5:  announced Lightning. It was with all things D and Ena Freed,

113
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,440
Speaker 5:  I believe it was asked like why no wireless charging. And Schiller

114
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,240
Speaker 5:  was basically like, oh we think that's just another thing you have to plug

115
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,840
Speaker 5:  into the wall. No one wants that. And then of course, fast forward five

116
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,520
Speaker 5:  years and it's 2017 and they're announcing wireless

117
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,110
Speaker 5:  charging and Phil Schiller is up there being like, pretty

118
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,940
Speaker 5:  soon every cafe you go to is going to have a chi charger

119
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,080
Speaker 5:  in every single table. Do you guys remember this when they were like, where's

120
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,210
Speaker 3:  My cafe table?

121
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,040
Speaker 5:  Every surface in the world is going to be a chi charger and

122
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,340
Speaker 5:  you're gonna be able to just put your phone down and charge it as if by magic.

123
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,200
Speaker 5:  And I bet my ongoing theory about this Apple event

124
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,720
Speaker 5:  is they're gonna spend like six seconds on U S B C. They're gonna be like,

125
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,960
Speaker 5:  look a port U S B C Europe and

126
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,320
Speaker 5:  then like three hours telling you how great bag safe

127
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,960
Speaker 5:  is.

128
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,700
Speaker 7:  I don't think they're gonna talk about Europe at all.

129
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,000
Speaker 5:  No, they're not gonna say Europe. They're not

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,960
Speaker 7:  Gonna say Europe at all. They're not gonna, they're not gonna make it seem

131
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,840
Speaker 7:  like they were forced into this. They're going to say how you now can use

132
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,760
Speaker 7:  the same charger for your iPad and your iPhone with the same

133
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,740
Speaker 7:  cable and we made it such convenience

134
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,980
Speaker 3:  And your AirPods

135
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,320
Speaker 7:  And your AirPods. Right. But yeah, I don't think it's going to be a lot of

136
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,120
Speaker 7:  discussion because there isn't a lot to say about it. It's a different port

137
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,830
Speaker 7:  to charge your phone.

138
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,200
Speaker 5:  Well I've been talking to a bunch of people who are like, so the, the thing

139
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,120
Speaker 5:  that happened when the iPad went from lightning to U S B

140
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,760
Speaker 5:  C was that all of a sudden there were You know new, new accessories that

141
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,210
Speaker 5:  could be supported. You could plug new things into it. You could get a a

142
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,920
Speaker 5:  bunch of ports in a dock. Like all new

143
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,640
Speaker 5:  computery things were suddenly possible. Some of those turned out to be very

144
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,400
Speaker 5:  cool. Most of them never really came to Frozen. And so I've talked to a bunch

145
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,350
Speaker 5:  of people who are like, oh I'm gonna be able to like plug my external storage

146
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,210
Speaker 5:  into my iPhone now. And I keep being like, you're not, you just

147
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,080
Speaker 5:  super aren't. Like I would be so shocked if Apple did

148
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,730
Speaker 5:  that. Apple

149
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,080
Speaker 6:  Decks is happening. I was

150
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,520
Speaker 3:  About to say Apple decks. Apple decks, like this is

151
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,480
Speaker 7:  The moment. I mean that is never gonna happen. We can, we can spend a whole

152
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,000
Speaker 7:  podcast on why that'll never happen. But it's worth like dissecting what

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,320
Speaker 7:  the rumors are saying about the U S B port. And so what they're saying is

154
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,240
Speaker 7:  U S B C port across the iPhones announced, which would be expect be the

155
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,000
Speaker 7:  iPhone 15, the iPhone 15 plus the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,960
Speaker 7:  15 Pro Max unless they change the name to Ultra or something like that. So

157
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,900
Speaker 7:  they'll all share the same port but they won't all share the same capabilities.

158
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,870
Speaker 7:  The lesser models will still be U SS B 2.0, which means that you're not

159
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,740
Speaker 7:  attaching a bunch of accessories to it because it doesn't have the bandwidth.

160
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,640
Speaker 7:  And then the pro models will have maybe Thunderbolt capabilities or

161
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,360
Speaker 7:  U S B four capability so that it is a faster data transfer

162
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,320
Speaker 7:  seed. What is missing from that is will it support like

163
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,300
Speaker 7:  proper video out? You can do that with an iPad, but will it do that

164
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,040
Speaker 7:  on the iPhone and, and it'll probably will in the way that like you can plug

165
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,000
Speaker 7:  it in and watch a video on a bigger screen. But a desktop software

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,840
Speaker 7:  environment is never gonna happen. I

167
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,310
Speaker 3:  Feel like they're kind of gonna be obligated to do it. Not just because

168
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,040
Speaker 3:  everybody, if you've got this port, you should be able to do all this stuff

169
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,160
Speaker 3:  that you can do with other devices that use the exact same processor but

170
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,700
Speaker 3:  also because of accessibility reasons. Like

171
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,560
Speaker 3:  if I have a phone, I should be able to use it however I

172
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,110
Speaker 3:  want, however I need to be able to.

173
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,360
Speaker 7:  Sure. And to be fair, the Lightning iPhone supports that already. Like you

174
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,660
Speaker 7:  can plug an iPhone right into a TV to play. You can use

175
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,620
Speaker 7:  the the Lightning to H D M I adapter and stuff like that.

176
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:26,840
Speaker 7:  How

177
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,560
Speaker 3:  Many people have that adapter and have done that? Like I've got a U S B C

178
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,460
Speaker 3:  to H T M I cable.

179
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,860
Speaker 5:  How often do you use it?

180
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,560
Speaker 3:  Not since I got rid of the Sony imaging webcam. Yeah.

181
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,470
Speaker 5:  So what are we talking about? I like

182
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,710
Speaker 7:  It's a, it's a pretty niche use case for sure.

183
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,570
Speaker 5:  Alex, the thing you just described is like a true and lovely idea

184
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,640
Speaker 5:  about a company that believes that people should be able to choose how their

185
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,200
Speaker 5:  devices work and has just nothing to do with Apple as it exists in the real

186
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,920
Speaker 5:  world. No, no,

187
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,970
Speaker 3:  No. I I think like, I think Apple has a moral

188
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,900
Speaker 3:  obligation to make it accessible if they have

189
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,520
Speaker 3:  the port that accessible Apple

190
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,640
Speaker 7:  Would say use airplay.

191
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,240
Speaker 5:  I think Apple doesn't give one solitary shit about your moral

192
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,010
Speaker 5:  obligations. I think Apple is going to lock this port down in

193
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,730
Speaker 5:  every single imaginable way and they're gonna tell the same security

194
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,200
Speaker 5:  story that they tell about the App store and everything else. They're gonna

195
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,260
Speaker 5:  say, if we just let you plug in anything, all kinds of things could go wrong.

196
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,640
Speaker 5:  All your important data is on your iPhone. We can't just let you plug in

197
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,280
Speaker 5:  a random thing. Bad things could happen and that's just true enough that

198
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,880
Speaker 5:  Apple's gonna get away with it. And honestly, I don't care because I, I,

199
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,550
Speaker 5:  I think the number of people who are out there wanting desperately to like

200
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,520
Speaker 5:  plug A U S B keyboard and three terabyte hard drive into their iPhone

201
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,880
Speaker 5:  to do things is like basically non-existent. I think

202
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,680
Speaker 6:  There's like M K B H D and six other YouTubers who are like, oh my God, I

203
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,640
Speaker 6:  can finally get these high res files off my iPhone in extra fast

204
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,200
Speaker 6:  time. So there, there's, someone's going to be happy tomorrow with with their

205
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,710
Speaker 6:  pro

206
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,050
Speaker 7:  That customer is buying an iPhone Pro

207
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,390
Speaker 7:  Ultra whatever. They're not buying the base model iPhone for sure. Yep.

208
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's fine. Okay, so that's, let's just run through some of the big

209
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,000
Speaker 5:  rumors here. So obviously U S B C is the big one and I would say like on

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,920
Speaker 5:  a scale of one to 10, how likely do we think that is? That's at least at

211
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,990
Speaker 5:  like a nine, right? Like I'd be shocked if that doesn't happen at this point.

212
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,280
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

213
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,240
Speaker 7:  That's a pretty safe, safe bet. I think. Yeah, I mean if they don't

214
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,310
Speaker 7:  do it, that'll be the whole story.

215
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's really true. That's really true. They're like here's just an

216
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,120
Speaker 5:  action button and like someone will raise their hand and be like, what about

217
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,320
Speaker 5:  the U S B C port? Have

218
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,620
Speaker 7:  We, have you heard about Lightning?

219
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,090
Speaker 5:  The second one is the action button, which has been the rumor

220
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,640
Speaker 5:  thing again, I think potentially just on the pro and pro Max

221
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,440
Speaker 5:  models, but kind of like the Apple Watch ultra. There will be a customizable

222
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,200
Speaker 5:  button you can use to do things. Personally, I'm very excited about

223
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,110
Speaker 5:  this as someone who does the same set of things

224
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,990
Speaker 5:  over and over constantly all day on my phone. Can I pour

225
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,280
Speaker 7:  Cold water all over your excitement please? Oh

226
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,020
Speaker 3:  No,

227
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,200
Speaker 7:  The action button on the Ultra, the watch Ultra does

228
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,100
Speaker 7:  nothing. Oh yeah. It's like the most disappointing thing ever.

229
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,600
Speaker 7:  And it would not surprise me if this action button on the iPhone is

230
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,840
Speaker 7:  similarly annoyingly

231
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,480
Speaker 5:  Limited. It like only opens control center and it replaces

232
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,590
Speaker 6:  A switch, right? Like the switch that was already there.

233
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,200
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it's getting rid of the mute button. They're

234
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,240
Speaker 6:  Taking away a button and adding a A slightly different

235
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,260
Speaker 6:  button.

236
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,660
Speaker 3:  Yes,

237
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,280
Speaker 7:  Adding something that could for a lot of people or the right person be a

238
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,440
Speaker 7:  better experience. Because like personally, I can't remember the last time

239
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,920
Speaker 7:  just like I can't remember the last time I plugged in my phone to a cable

240
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,340
Speaker 7:  to charge. I can't remember the last time I flicked the mute switch on my,

241
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,740
Speaker 7:  the side of my phone. It's always on mute. Yeah,

242
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,670
Speaker 5:  We talked about this last week. It's because you're not a hundred years old.

243
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,920
Speaker 5:  Like everyone who lets their phone ring loudly, Dan

244
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,380
Speaker 5:  congratulations you did it.

245
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,080
Speaker 7:  But they're not switching it either. That's why it's always ringing. No,

246
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,420
Speaker 7:  no, no. 'cause they're not switching the mute.

247
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,520
Speaker 3:  So here's the deal. Last week I ranted about this button because I still

248
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,200
Speaker 3:  think it's stupid. 'cause all I'm gonna do is turn it into a mute button

249
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,140
Speaker 3:  because that's what I need it for. And somebody wrote back and was like,

250
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,400
Speaker 3:  you are stupid Cranz. And I always stop and pay attention when someone says

251
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,380
Speaker 3:  that this person seems they're right. Right? They might be. And this person

252
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,260
Speaker 3:  was like, every, it feels like every week I have to go and tell my

253
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,740
Speaker 3:  dad that he just has the mute button on and that's why he's not getting calls.

254
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,280
Speaker 3:  And I was like, oh, oh there, I forget that there are other people that use

255
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,080
Speaker 3:  technology that way. It was a nice thank you, it was a

256
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,520
Speaker 3:  nice reminder. I still think I'm right, but like I still think he's

257
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,460
Speaker 3:  wrong.

258
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,280
Speaker 7:  In a perfect world, I could set this button to launch the camera or

259
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,960
Speaker 7:  launch a third party camera app or switch focus modes

260
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,080
Speaker 7:  or whatever. Like I could customize it to my hearts content. I'm a

261
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,560
Speaker 7:  little reticent to get that excited that I'll be able to do all the things

262
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,480
Speaker 7:  I wanna do with it just because of the evidence with the Apple Watch

263
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,060
Speaker 7:  Ultra, even though the Apple Watch software is admittedly much more limited

264
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,640
Speaker 7:  in lockdown than the iPhones is even. So you're

265
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,500
Speaker 3:  Gonna be able to open control center, mute things, open

266
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,790
Speaker 3:  the fitness app so you can see all the new fitness

267
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,370
Speaker 3:  opportunities

268
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,600
Speaker 7:  Start a workout. I

269
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,040
Speaker 5:  Don't know, the thing that gives me hope is the You know the the triple tap

270
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,600
Speaker 5:  gesture on the back of the iPhone that you can do that's actually pretty

271
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,080
Speaker 5:  customizable. You can use it to do a bunch of different actions. You can

272
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,040
Speaker 5:  use it to open stuff. Like just take that and put it on the action

273
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,440
Speaker 5:  button. The triple tap thing for people who don't know is actually really

274
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,400
Speaker 5:  useful. And I turned it on expecting to get like a million false positives

275
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,200
Speaker 5:  and it would be really annoying, but it's not. It's great you should turn

276
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,520
Speaker 5:  it on. But I think if even just like that level of customizability where

277
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,080
Speaker 5:  it's like, let me open an app or do like a shortcut, I'm good. I'd be

278
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,120
Speaker 5:  happy and I think we might get it. Okay, so that's the other one. There are

279
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,110
Speaker 5:  a bunch of spec upgrades possible a 17 chips

280
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,940
Speaker 5:  wifi, six E potentially eight gigs of RAM

281
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,670
Speaker 5:  in the high-end phones or even potentially in all of them.

282
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,120
Speaker 7:  Yeah, the the thing about all the spec upgrades is they're all expected for

283
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,080
Speaker 7:  the pro models, right? So like the regular 15 is basically expected

284
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,910
Speaker 7:  to be a microwaved iPhone 14 pro

285
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,800
Speaker 7:  with the same level of specs there. Dynamic island will is rumored to

286
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,840
Speaker 7:  come to the 15 model. So the whole line will, will support the dynamic

287
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,760
Speaker 7:  island. Maybe they'll all support always on display, which was

288
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,860
Speaker 7:  something that was limited to the pros last year, which would mean that with

289
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,800
Speaker 7:  iOS 17 you could use the standby mode to its full extent regardless of which

290
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,780
Speaker 7:  iPhone you buy this year. But in terms of like performance increases, those

291
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,560
Speaker 7:  are really going to be limited to the 15 pro by all all

292
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,360
Speaker 7:  accounts, which

293
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,280
Speaker 5:  Seems like Apple's kind of move now. And I think it,

294
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,040
Speaker 5:  it really seems like Apple has just embraced this idea that there's no

295
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,310
Speaker 5:  chance you're upgrading from last year's phone to this year's phone. So what

296
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,160
Speaker 5:  they need is like every three years the upgrade should feel meaningful,

297
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,000
Speaker 5:  right? So if you start with the pro and trickle it down and then start with

298
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,360
Speaker 5:  the next year's pro and trickle it down that accrues over You know the three

299
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,920
Speaker 5:  or four year lifespan of your phone into something fairly meaningful. But

300
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,720
Speaker 5:  it does make every one of these upgrades like we used to be on that sort

301
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,560
Speaker 5:  of TikTok schedule of like big upgrade small improvements. It just,

302
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,830
Speaker 5:  it's just talks every year now. Yeah.

303
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,760
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So I guess one thing, one note with this year's iPhones,

304
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,460
Speaker 7:  this is the iPhone 15, we're not really anticipating huge

305
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,250
Speaker 7:  design changes from the rumors. Maybe some rounding of corners,

306
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,870
Speaker 7:  maybe some rounded glass a little bit. But it's effectively gonna visually

307
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,840
Speaker 7:  look very similar to the 14, the 13 and the 12. So this would be

308
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,630
Speaker 7:  like the fourth year in a row of this design language if this

309
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,150
Speaker 7:  pans out, which to your point David is, is like kind of like these small

310
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,940
Speaker 7:  iterative updates and if you've held onto an iPhone 11

311
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,500
Speaker 7:  or an iPhone 10 s for five years, you'll

312
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,080
Speaker 7:  get a big upgrade with the iPhone 15. But even coming from a

313
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,850
Speaker 7:  13 to the 15, you might not get a huge upgrade

314
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,320
Speaker 7:  based on what we know so far at

315
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,300
Speaker 5:  Least. Yeah. I do wonder what amount of time Apple has in its brain

316
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,360
Speaker 5:  for how long they think the upgrade cycle is gonna be. 'cause to your point,

317
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,800
Speaker 5:  if you're coming from like an 11, let's say, this is gonna feel like a big

318
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,080
Speaker 5:  upgrade even if it's sort of the smallest version of what we need. But like

319
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,480
Speaker 5:  you said, if you have a, if you have a 13, which not that long ago would

320
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,390
Speaker 5:  be a perfectly normal sort of upgrade cycle, like every, every two years,

321
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,960
Speaker 5:  nothing in what we've heard so far makes me think this is going to be like

322
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,920
Speaker 5:  a meaningfully different phone experience. I guess the one thing could possibly

323
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,830
Speaker 5:  be there's been this rumor of the Parascoping telephoto lens

324
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,300
Speaker 5:  that might get you a bunch more zoom it be cool, that could be cool and exciting.

325
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,240
Speaker 5:  But in terms of like actual new things I can do on my phone, not that

326
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,920
Speaker 5:  much.

327
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,090
Speaker 3:  I, I know this is coming from the person who just said that Apple has a moral

328
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,040
Speaker 3:  obligation, who, who, who suggested

329
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,000
Speaker 3:  that? But how much of this is actually on Apple? Like,

330
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,900
Speaker 3:  like the tick, tick, tick because I, I feel like it's, it's not entirely

331
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,720
Speaker 3:  on Apple. I feel like just the whole technology, like all mobile

332
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,340
Speaker 3:  phone technology is kind of slowed down, right?

333
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,080
Speaker 6:  Are there features that we're looking at that the iPhone doesn't have that,

334
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,440
Speaker 6:  that we wish it had that other phones are, are using right now? Right?

335
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,000
Speaker 3:  Like and it's like, okay, what was the last big feature? Folding

336
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,320
Speaker 3:  phones, which that'll be cool when Apple eventually does it 12 years from

337
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,130
Speaker 3:  now and then the telescoping lens, which

338
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,020
Speaker 3:  might happen this year, like the Samsung SuperZoo, that's about

339
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,040
Speaker 3:  it, right? Like, I'm trying to think of other things where I'm like, oh man,

340
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,480
Speaker 3:  I want that on an iPhone. I

341
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,280
Speaker 7:  I You know. I I think that actually gives Apple kind of a pass. And, and

342
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,960
Speaker 7:  the reason I feel that way is Apple is such a trendsetter, you

343
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,920
Speaker 3:  Think they have a moral obligation to,

344
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,690
Speaker 7:  I think they have a moral obligation to push the envelope and

345
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,550
Speaker 7:  break us out of this boring smartphone malaise. But realistically

346
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,440
Speaker 7:  they are such a trendsetter in this industry because they are such

347
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,950
Speaker 7:  a taste maker in the industry. And so like the fact that like Apple

348
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,920
Speaker 7:  doesn't really seem to be, and like they argued this endlessly that

349
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,670
Speaker 7:  they are innovating out their eyeballs, but the

350
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,520
Speaker 7:  real impact is like the, the smartphone as we know it has been the same

351
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,440
Speaker 7:  for a long time to David's point. And so like if anyone's going to push this

352
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,060
Speaker 7:  forward and move us out of it, Apple's in a really great position to do that.

353
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,320
Speaker 7:  And it just like, they're such a conservative company.

354
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,200
Speaker 3:  I mean that's not Tim Cook's Apple, right? Right. Like he's busy with with

355
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,860
Speaker 3:  some other stuff. All the vr ar stuff. He doesn't have time to be pushing

356
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,120
Speaker 3:  the envelope on the thing that just prints him money every

357
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,920
Speaker 3:  year.

358
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,680
Speaker 7:  I I will say the one thing that is kind of a, maybe, maybe a little

359
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,520
Speaker 7:  bit exciting to me is the rumor that the 15 Pro Pro Max

360
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,440
Speaker 7:  will use titanium. And the reason that I think that is kind of

361
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Speaker 7:  cool and exciting is because I think that the pro models have been way too

362
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,880
Speaker 7:  heavy for like five years and they've stuck with this stainless steel and

363
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,320
Speaker 7:  it weighs a ton and they feel like bricks and titanium would be slightly

364
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,740
Speaker 7:  lighter and I would like a lighter phone. I

365
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,600
Speaker 3:  I'm down for that. I

366
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,920
Speaker 6:  Think Dan's right. But I think that what we're seeing here, they admitted

367
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,760
Speaker 6:  that they don't have any new ideas for the phone. That's why they brought

368
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,050
Speaker 6:  out the Vision Pro because they can't guarantee that you will buy a new phone

369
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,550
Speaker 6:  every year and they need to sell you a different thing. They need to get

370
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,880
Speaker 6:  more money from you somehow. And that's why the Vision Pro is happening

371
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,830
Speaker 6:  because what are we gonna put in the phone to make you buy one?

372
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,120
Speaker 6:  Well,

373
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,080
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I mean we, we've had these conversations for years. What is the next

374
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,590
Speaker 7:  iPhone for Apple, right? The iPhone is the bread and butter of the company.

375
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,240
Speaker 7:  It's, it's, it's 75% of its revenue, et cetera, et

376
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,160
Speaker 7:  cetera. And, and this year the Vision Pro is it, a few years ago it was

377
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,320
Speaker 7:  the Apple Watch and a few years before that it was the iPad and neither of

378
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,080
Speaker 7:  them really were able to dethrone the

379
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,740
Speaker 7:  iPhone as Apple's main business. And so now we're onto

380
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,240
Speaker 7:  vr, but at the end of the day, okay, the iPhone is still Apple's bread and

381
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,760
Speaker 7:  butter. You

382
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,620
Speaker 6:  Didn't even mention Apple TV or Home Pod.

383
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:05,920
Speaker 7:  I'm

384
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,720
Speaker 5:  Sorry, I'll coach you. No, I I just think in a funny

385
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,000
Speaker 5:  way, I think a lot of what we're doing in the tech industry in general right

386
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,870
Speaker 5:  now is realizing that nothing is probably ever going to be as big as

387
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,760
Speaker 5:  smartphones. That like this idea that someone was going to

388
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,480
Speaker 5:  basically come up with one kind of gadget that every

389
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,410
Speaker 5:  single person on earth was going to dedicate their lives to was like a

390
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,030
Speaker 5:  maybe a bad idea and b probably

391
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,800
Speaker 5:  irreparable, right? Like there, I just don't see a world in which that

392
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,200
Speaker 5:  happens again anytime soon. That's because

393
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,680
Speaker 3:  You're not in Tim Cook's world looking at the VR

394
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
Speaker 3:  headsets. Yeah.

395
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,880
Speaker 5:  But he's selling 'em for $3,500. Right? He's perfectly happy to not have

396
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,520
Speaker 5:  everybody buy one at least for a very long time. Yeah,

397
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,440
Speaker 3:  I think you're right though. I I, I definitely agree with you. Like we, we've

398
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,420
Speaker 3:  hit this point where we all experienced one of the biggest shifts in technology

399
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,270
Speaker 3:  in like the history of the world and in some ways bigger even

400
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,040
Speaker 3:  than the personal computer, right? Like way more people

401
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,920
Speaker 3:  have phones than personal computers forever. And, and way more

402
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,160
Speaker 3:  people now have access to the internet. Like this was truly that window into

403
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,200
Speaker 3:  the internet. And now it's like, oh, you can't, you just can't replicate

404
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,890
Speaker 3:  that. Yeah, you're gonna try with ar, vr and, and new

405
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,700
Speaker 3:  weird laptops and folding phones and stuff, but like

406
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,380
Speaker 3:  we did it, it's like refrigerators. We had the big huge moment.

407
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,960
Speaker 3:  Now everyone's got one and now I update it every 10 years or when it makes

408
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,070
Speaker 3:  a weird loud noise in the middle of the night.

409
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,640
Speaker 5:  It's a life and when you do, it will start sending you push notifications.

410
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,320
Speaker 5:  Yes. So congratulations. No, I I, yeah, I think, I think it's

411
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,240
Speaker 5:  possible and I sort of expect to have

412
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,850
Speaker 5:  this thrown in my face, but I think it's possible that

413
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,620
Speaker 5:  Apple has something coming here that it has not

414
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,350
Speaker 5:  leaked yet. It just, this doesn't

415
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,320
Speaker 5:  seem like a whole story for Apple and it's the

416
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,980
Speaker 5:  iPhone 15 and Apple likes round numbers. It has

417
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,120
Speaker 5:  to Dan's point been a while since we got like a

418
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,080
Speaker 5:  meaningful big change. Maybe U Ss B C is that thing. But I

419
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,440
Speaker 5:  also feel like if I'm Apple and I'm looking at that thing and it's like,

420
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,320
Speaker 5:  okay, we're being forced to change our port, we have to like play along with

421
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,270
Speaker 5:  this new rules. Like let's take this as a moment to do something

422
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,070
Speaker 5:  unusual. What would that be? I don't know. This is the thing,

423
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,560
Speaker 5:  they already

424
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,320
Speaker 6:  Put satellite connectivity in the phone, which has admittedly it

425
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,580
Speaker 6:  folds in half, like saved a couple of people's lives. Not a small thing.

426
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,400
Speaker 5:  No. Yeah. The satellite stuff is real. I totally agree. I

427
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,280
Speaker 7:  I will say You know when we had this discussion last year ahead of the iPhone

428
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,200
Speaker 7:  14 Pro launch, the rumor mill was saying it was trying

429
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,800
Speaker 7:  to decipher what these cutouts on the screen would look like and nobody really

430
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,270
Speaker 7:  predicted what the dynamic island would be. And that is the one

431
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,920
Speaker 7:  area that Apple doesn't really leak Yeah. Is

432
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,800
Speaker 7:  the software side of things. And so if there are new

433
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,550
Speaker 7:  hardware features on the device, we don't

434
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,340
Speaker 7:  know how Apple will use it or integrate it into its software. And

435
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,740
Speaker 7:  we, we can, we can talk about how effective Dynamic Island is,

436
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,580
Speaker 7:  but it wasn't what anybody predicted. And

437
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,320
Speaker 7:  so maybe the, like you're saying, maybe there's something that like we just

438
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,040
Speaker 7:  can't see because we are only seeing based on the supply chain,

439
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,660
Speaker 7:  which can only see hardware components.

440
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,360
Speaker 3:  Do you think it's something around the button You

441
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,080
Speaker 5:  Know what would be awesome is if if with the titanium, we've been

442
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,600
Speaker 5:  trying to do this shatterproof glass thing for forever, if Apple has like

443
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,580
Speaker 5:  finally cracked the, like we have made you a phone that is like the

444
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,480
Speaker 5:  old, like Nokia 33 10, like you can't break it. Even if you try oh man and

445
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,140
Speaker 5:  Tim Cook just like gets on stage and just like hucks his phone into the ground

446
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,580
Speaker 5:  and then picks up. That would be the coolest iPhone launch of all time instantly.

447
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,240
Speaker 5:  That's not what I'm rooting for. I don't think it's happening, but that's

448
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,040
Speaker 5:  what I want.

449
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,450
Speaker 3:  I don't think it's happening, but I want this so bad. I want like the reverse

450
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,880
Speaker 3:  cyber truck reveal because

451
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,280
Speaker 5:  That's really what it is, right? Like if we're in, if we're in phones or

452
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,240
Speaker 5:  appliance mode, it's durability and it's battery life are the two

453
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,950
Speaker 5:  things that everybody should continue to press against because

454
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,880
Speaker 5:  that makes my existing phone life, which most people are fine with

455
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,720
Speaker 5:  meaningfully better immediately. I still see an alarming number of

456
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,680
Speaker 5:  people with broken phone screens just out in the world. It's crazy.

457
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,770
Speaker 3:  I just had to look to make sure mine was working. Right now it's

458
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,520
Speaker 7:  Apple could make things more repairable. It did that with iPhone 14, not

459
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,320
Speaker 7:  the 14 pro, but the 14 was designed to be more repairable. So maybe that

460
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,580
Speaker 7:  extends across the line. That would be a step forward. It'd be a small step,

461
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,190
Speaker 7:  but

462
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,760
Speaker 3:  Well and they just, they just really kind of embraced California's

463
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,560
Speaker 3:  repairability law a couple of weeks ago. Right. So like

464
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,390
Speaker 7:  Begrudgingly Yeah.

465
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:34,680
Speaker 3:  They

466
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,640
Speaker 7:  Are embracing U S B C Alex. Yeah,

467
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,000
Speaker 5:  Exactly.

468
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,960
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Where they like kick you when you use it. Like you're just gonna get

469
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,440
Speaker 3:  kicked to the pants every time you plug U S B C into this thing and every

470
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,240
Speaker 3:  time you order one of those, those like the the repair kits, somebody's gonna

471
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Speaker 3:  come to your door and kick you in the pants and be like, you shouldn't be

472
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,780
Speaker 3:  using this

473
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,980
Speaker 5:  And then charge you $600. Yeah.

474
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,780
Speaker 6:  But it's one of those things where Apple being Apple, they could make a huge

475
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,080
Speaker 6:  gap between them and the Samsungs and the Googles and the whoever else is

476
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,980
Speaker 6:  of the world because they just can't control phone design and components

477
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,100
Speaker 6:  the way that they can to Yeah. Potentially make something more appealable.

478
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,920
Speaker 6:  As one last thing to note, what do you guys think of the rumors about the

479
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,750
Speaker 6:  price that You know the most expensive models will be maybe a hundred dollars

480
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,670
Speaker 6:  more expensive than they used to be or

481
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,640
Speaker 3:  It's stupid. It makes sense, but I hate it so therefore it

482
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,580
Speaker 3:  is stupid. I'm just talking you through my, my, my mind,

483
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,200
Speaker 3:  my processing here. Like does it really need to be more

484
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,080
Speaker 3:  expensive? I feel like no, is Titanium

485
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,960
Speaker 3:  really adding a hundred dollars to it, especially because the phone, like

486
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,640
Speaker 3:  the difference between how much it costs to manufacture it and sell it is

487
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,790
Speaker 3:  fairly large. It just feels like price creep.

488
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,440
Speaker 7:  Well it certainly is. I mean if Apple is nothing, if not very good at

489
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,300
Speaker 7:  preserving profit margins and providing or,

490
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,240
Speaker 7:  or convincing people in perceived value, and when you say it's titanium and

491
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,880
Speaker 7:  new materials and different, I don't think it's hard for them to jump a hundred

492
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,820
Speaker 7:  dollars in perceived value. We've seen across

493
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,720
Speaker 7:  the board technology getting more expensive at over the past few

494
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,320
Speaker 7:  years as inflation has gone up and as the supply chain issues and things

495
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,000
Speaker 7:  like that. Samsung's tablet s nine tablet line this summer is a hundred dollars

496
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,820
Speaker 7:  more across the board. And that is like kind of backwards from

497
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,160
Speaker 7:  how we want to experience technology and that it like gets cheaper over

498
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,120
Speaker 7:  time, but it's just kind of like the world we're in. I will not be surprised

499
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,560
Speaker 7:  for a second if they start at 10 99 now. And I also don't think it's going

500
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,440
Speaker 7:  to impact their sales much because most people are buying these on payment

501
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,240
Speaker 7:  plans over 24 or 36 months, whatever it might be. It's a buck or two a month.

502
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,720
Speaker 7:  They're not even gonna notice it. So I I don't think it's gonna make much

503
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,120
Speaker 7:  of it. It'll just make Apple more money. Well and

504
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,190
Speaker 3:  The pro isn't their bestselling model, right? Like it's the regular

505
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,230
Speaker 3:  iPhones?

506
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,120
Speaker 7:  Well yeah, I mean like the, the bestselling model I believe of last year's

507
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,880
Speaker 7:  round was iPhone 14, but the 14 Pro was close behind it and

508
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,030
Speaker 7:  nobody bought the 14 plus.

509
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:55,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah, the big cheap Screens theory really took a hit last year. It wasn't

510
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:55,710
Speaker 5:  cheap.

511
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,680
Speaker 7:  That was the problem. That's

512
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,580
Speaker 5:  True.

513
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,520
Speaker 7:  It was $900. Like, I mean you're, you are like looking at an iPhone 14

514
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,960
Speaker 7:  pro Max at that point. Like yeah, if they did it for less than that then

515
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,520
Speaker 7:  yeah, I, I could have seen that argument, but it wasn't cheap. That was a

516
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:07,960
Speaker 7:  problem.

517
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,620
Speaker 3:  I guess that's, that's one of the things they could change here, right? Like

518
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,360
Speaker 3:  the pricing schemes, because last year they did get really weird and it was

519
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,260
Speaker 3:  a lot of confusion and we immediately saw that reflected in what

520
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,060
Speaker 3:  got purchased and what didn't. And this year maybe if they raise those prices

521
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,070
Speaker 3:  on the most expensive ones, maybe they draw up the prices on the cheaper

522
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,700
Speaker 3:  ones to make that Delta significant. Yeah,

523
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,600
Speaker 7:  It makes if they could keep the 15 plus at that $900 price, but now

524
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,520
Speaker 7:  it's $300 to go to the 15 Pro Max and so that's like a

525
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,920
Speaker 7:  much more significant gap and so that that might be the move there. Yeah.

526
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,640
Speaker 7:  And and maybe people would more gravitate towards the 15 plus if they want

527
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,140
Speaker 7:  a big screen.

528
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,400
Speaker 3:  But no, we should demand they be cheaper, rise up. They have a moral

529
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,680
Speaker 3:  obligation. Have you

530
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,430
Speaker 5:  Considered the perspective of the Apple shareholder Alex?

531
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,080
Speaker 3:  They have a moral obligation? Well,

532
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,500
Speaker 7:  So well somebody think about the profit margins,

533
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,460
Speaker 5:  It really, it's such a cynical idea to think that instead of

534
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,440
Speaker 5:  making one thing cheaper in order to make the price differences more obvious,

535
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,280
Speaker 5:  they're just gonna make the other thing more expensive. But that's also a

536
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,770
Speaker 5:  hundred percent what's gonna happen. That's

537
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,380
Speaker 5:  rough. All right, let's see. So what else are we expecting? There's gonna

538
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,760
Speaker 5:  be, we think a new Apple watch, which by all accounts is going to be thoroughly

539
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,340
Speaker 5:  unexciting, teeny tiny upgrades on the old Apple Watch.

540
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,220
Speaker 7:  So I, I think what we're expecting of the new Apple Watch lineup

541
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,810
Speaker 7:  is a similar design, whether that's a series model, series nine or the

542
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:30,400
Speaker 7:  Ultra, but they are rumored to have a finally a

543
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,960
Speaker 7:  faster processor. Basically the Apple Watch has used the same

544
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,880
Speaker 7:  performing processor since I think the S six or series six. And there's just

545
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,680
Speaker 7:  been some small health sensors added to it with this

546
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,040
Speaker 7:  model. The rumors are saying that we'll actually get a faster performing

547
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,830
Speaker 7:  processor, which will be the first time in a while that we've had that

548
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,960
Speaker 3:  Will that translate to better battery life?

549
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,920
Speaker 5:  I have never once been like, my watch is slow. I think

550
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,300
Speaker 5:  my watch is stupid and doesn't do much and I wish Siri would talk to me less,

551
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,100
Speaker 5:  but it does not feel slow. Maybe the widgets thing

552
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,940
Speaker 5:  as this stuff gets more useful will make it feel slower

553
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,200
Speaker 5:  as you use it more. I I

554
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,780
Speaker 7:  Think if you have a recent model Apple Watch Yes. But if you had one of the

555
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,400
Speaker 7:  say series four or earlier Oh,

556
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,280
Speaker 5:  For Shark? Yeah, yeah,

557
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,560
Speaker 7:  Yeah. They, they got slow. The series three got to be a, the

558
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,120
Speaker 5:  Series the to give very slow. I agree with that. Yeah. And then I guess what

559
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,560
Speaker 5:  is it, next year, mark Germond at Bloomberg was reporting that there's potentially

560
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,190
Speaker 5:  a much bigger Apple watch redesign coming Yeah.

561
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,080
Speaker 7:  With new manufacturing using three D printing techniques and stuff like

562
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,560
Speaker 7:  that. But it doesn't seem like that is slated for this year's model. Okay.

563
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,460
Speaker 7:  And if I read it correctly,

564
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,320
Speaker 3:  But nothing on battery life, we haven't heard one way or the other improvements.

565
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,560
Speaker 7:  I I mean Apple's claimed the same 18 hours of battery life on the series

566
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,460
Speaker 7:  models for since like series one Yeah. Or

567
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,210
Speaker 7:  two. So I, I mean if you want more battery life, they have the

568
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,840
Speaker 7:  ultra that is, that is their, their pitch for battery life is the ultra

569
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,740
Speaker 3:  Yeah. That will never fit on this hand.

570
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,240
Speaker 5:  And Then we think probably, we think probably new AirPods too, right?

571
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,400
Speaker 5:  Potentially like just to put a u s BBC port on them. Yeah.

572
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,360
Speaker 7:  It'll be interesting to how this is handled. Like do we get all new AirPods

573
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,600
Speaker 7:  or just a air, a new case that they sell when Oh, that's interesting. Basically

574
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,800
Speaker 7:  the same AirPods with a new port and then you can buy the case separately.

575
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,500
Speaker 7:  They did that with the wireless charging way back when, I think it was the,

576
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,360
Speaker 7:  the AirPods two, they first launched without wireless charging and then you

577
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,960
Speaker 7:  could buy the case with wireless charging or you could buy it bundled

578
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,680
Speaker 7:  together. So it'll be interesting to see if that happens. This is one area

579
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,160
Speaker 7:  where like the supply chain leaks have not shown anything. And so like there's

580
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,140
Speaker 7:  been no new designs of AirPods released or leaked or anything like that.

581
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,120
Speaker 7:  So the idea being if they put U S B C on it is

582
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,020
Speaker 7:  they're, they're solely to match the fact that the iPhone has U S B C.

583
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,140
Speaker 7:  And so you use the same charging cable for both.

584
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,160
Speaker 3:  Is that gonna be the last of the lightning stuff? If they do, if they switch

585
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,140
Speaker 3:  both of those over still some iPads. Right?

586
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,040
Speaker 7:  So the base model ninth gen iPad, which

587
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,600
Speaker 7:  is the like cheapest iPad you could buy, is still being sold new by Apple

588
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,400
Speaker 7:  that's got a lightning, the magic keyboard for the Mac and the

589
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,950
Speaker 7:  magic truck pad for the Mac are still lightning.

590
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,320
Speaker 5:  Wait, the did we, did we fix the flip upside down mouse? Is that

591
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,540
Speaker 5:  finally No.

592
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,680
Speaker 7:  Out of commission? That's Oh yeah. The magic mouse is still lightning. Still

593
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,700
Speaker 7:  lightning?

594
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,980
Speaker 5:  Yes. Well, here's hoping they fix all that all at once.

595
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,070
Speaker 3:  That's gonna be the big surprise. That's gonna be the big splash.

596
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,530
Speaker 7:  There's also rumors for the October event of that Apple usually

597
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,400
Speaker 7:  holds that we will see M three Max and a new iMac with

598
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,160
Speaker 7:  an M three processor. And I think that's when we'll see U S B C ports on

599
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,410
Speaker 7:  the peripherals. The

600
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,320
Speaker 5:  Truly pettiest thing Apple could do if it really wants to get everybody into

601
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,180
Speaker 5:  wireless charging is put U S B C ports on everything, but

602
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,160
Speaker 5:  put them always in the most inconvenient place. Like in the same

603
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,630
Speaker 5:  way that on the Magic Mouse it's on the bottom put in in the middle

604
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:39,830
Speaker 7:  Of

605
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:43,200
Speaker 5:  The track. Yeah, put it on like the top left corner of the iPhone. They're

606
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,340
Speaker 5:  like, oh, you wanna plug it in? Knock yourself out. Great. Good. Good luck.

607
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,680
Speaker 5:  Congratulations. It's

608
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,480
Speaker 7:  In, it's in the dynamic

609
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,030
Speaker 7:  island.

610
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it, yeah. I love this. This is, this is my new favorite idea. Tim Cook,

611
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,340
Speaker 5:  if you're listening, please charge the dynamic island. I love it. Oh,

612
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,200
Speaker 5:  one more Apple thing actually that I'm curious what y'all think about. So

613
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,870
Speaker 5:  there was this announcement this week from Apple

614
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:10,800
Speaker 5:  that the Vision Pro app store for the headset presumably

615
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,540
Speaker 5:  coming next year will include by default

616
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,320
Speaker 5:  all iPhone and iPad apps that are compatible, which obviously has

617
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,100
Speaker 5:  some You know what compatibility means is difficult, but it means

618
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,080
Speaker 5:  by default if developers don't turn it off, a huge number of iPhone

619
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,060
Speaker 5:  and iPad apps are just going to be available for the Vision Pro on day one.

620
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,490
Speaker 5:  Is this a good idea or a terrible idea?

621
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,950
Speaker 3:  Great idea. Yeah. Can you, because you're gonna be able to go find that one

622
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:39,350
Speaker 3:  fart app that has just survived this whole

623
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,840
Speaker 3:  time and immediately be like in the

624
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,560
Speaker 3:  virtual space that's incredible. Like

625
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,760
Speaker 3:  $3,500 spent. Absolutely. I want a fart app.

626
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,560
Speaker 3:  Just

627
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,120
Speaker 7:  I, I think it's a necessary move to

628
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,040
Speaker 7:  give the people that are actually buying these for $3,500, something

629
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,440
Speaker 7:  to do on their headsets other than the five to 10 apps that are ready to

630
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,280
Speaker 7:  go at launch. Yeah. I don't think it's going to be a great experience for

631
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,480
Speaker 7:  the vast majority of apps. Everything that I've seen from developers playing

632
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,380
Speaker 7:  with them and things like that. I have said like if you have an iPad

633
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,030
Speaker 7:  app, it'll run, but you really should be redesigning it for this

634
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,680
Speaker 7:  spatial interface. Well

635
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Speaker 3:  It's, I mean this is the same thing that happened with iPhone to iPad and

636
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,480
Speaker 3:  every time you accidentally open an iPhone app on your iPad, you're like,

637
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,350
Speaker 3:  oh Jesus

638
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,840
Speaker 7:  Instagram threads in the 2020 third year of our

639
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,720
Speaker 7:  Lord. You're

640
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,680
Speaker 3:  Just really upset. And so that's what's gonna happen for VR for, for

641
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,350
Speaker 3:  this headset only. It's gonna be for like the next three or four years.

642
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,640
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think it, yeah, it's gonna take some time and then like it'll taper

643
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,840
Speaker 7:  off and You know if the platform is a success and it gets the developer interest

644
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,830
Speaker 7:  and the customer interest and all that, there will be more, more native,

645
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,520
Speaker 7:  just like the iPad took a couple of years to get really great native iPad

646
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,540
Speaker 7:  apps. Do you,

647
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,680
Speaker 3:  Do you think the visual design, so like You know when you, when you open

648
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,000
Speaker 3:  those iPad apps, oftentimes they feel like they're from

649
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,840
Speaker 3:  2008, they're from like the, the dawn of the iPhone. It's like

650
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,100
Speaker 3:  nothing's changed that isomorphic design and everything. Do you think like

651
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,960
Speaker 3:  the same thing's gonna happen with this new headset where you'll still

652
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,740
Speaker 3:  be like, like not only stuck because it's this giant blown up app,

653
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,440
Speaker 3:  but because like the design is so different, the UI

654
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,950
Speaker 3:  design is so different from whatever's coming.

655
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,480
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I mean I think, I think that is a part of it, right? And that's part

656
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,000
Speaker 7:  of the reason that like all the developers that I see posting on social about

657
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,920
Speaker 7:  it are saying they need to redesign it because the design language of, and

658
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,400
Speaker 7:  David, maybe you could speak to this more 'cause you've got firsthand experience

659
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,440
Speaker 7:  with it, but the design language of vision OSS is very different than iOS

660
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,360
Speaker 7:  and iPad oss. It's got a lot of transparency and layers and depth and things

661
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,470
Speaker 7:  like that. And like iOS is notoriously

662
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,510
Speaker 7:  flat.

663
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,460
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean if you, if you just like think about the structure of a normal

664
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,190
Speaker 5:  iOS app, it's like there's a bar at the bottom with some stuff.

665
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,480
Speaker 5:  There's all your stuff in the middle, up at the top, there's probably a menu

666
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,280
Speaker 5:  button that opens things and then like the settings live off to

667
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,780
Speaker 5:  one side, right? Yeah. That's kind of the like standard structure of an iOS

668
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,230
Speaker 5:  app. If that's the best we can do in augmented reality,

669
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:07,120
Speaker 5:  like, boy did we blow it in the future, you You know the way

670
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,080
Speaker 5:  you use it is by using your fingers and you, you look at the

671
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,660
Speaker 5:  menu item that you wanna click on and then you click your fingers together

672
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,950
Speaker 5:  and that's how you do it. And if I have to sit there and be like,

673
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,640
Speaker 5:  okay, look up, click on the thing that goes to settings, then move my head

674
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,790
Speaker 5:  all the way over here, look at the thing with my name on it, click that,

675
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:27,580
Speaker 5:  look down a list, click that. Like, no, that's bad. We have blown it.

676
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:27,880
Speaker 5:  And then

677
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,500
Speaker 3:  Periodically having to make, make it big so you can actually find the button

678
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,480
Speaker 3:  and hit just Right.

679
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,400
Speaker 5:  Right. Exactly. Yeah. No, this is, this is a mess. And I feel like this

680
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,840
Speaker 5:  thing that Apple is trying to do where it basically seems

681
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,790
Speaker 5:  increasingly, like the iPad app is kind of the like atomic

682
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,280
Speaker 5:  unit of it. And then iPad apps can move to Mac where

683
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,880
Speaker 5:  they more or less work iPad apps are

684
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,640
Speaker 5:  increasingly in, have everything in common with iPhone

685
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,920
Speaker 5:  apps where things mostly work in both places even though the screen sizes

686
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,900
Speaker 5:  are different. And now they wanna put iPad apps in particular onto

687
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,480
Speaker 5:  the Vision Pro. And I just don't think that's gonna keep working

688
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,340
Speaker 5:  forever. Like you have this one rectangular

689
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,270
Speaker 5:  screen and you should be able to put that on all of your rectangular

690
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:17,190
Speaker 5:  screens. I'm just not sure that holds forever as much as Apple seems to

691
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:20,920
Speaker 5:  want it to. But I do agree it's a decent stop gap and like a

692
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,870
Speaker 5:  bunch of half functional apps are probably better than

693
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,070
Speaker 5:  no apps at all. At first,

694
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,710
Speaker 7:  Like, like if you wanna watch Netflix, like the iPad Netflix app will

695
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:33,690
Speaker 7:  be more than sufficient. Yeah. To play Netflix in front of your face in in

696
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,590
Speaker 7:  the, on the video, it

697
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,900
Speaker 3:  Just won't be as cool. 'cause you won't be in a little weird virtual

698
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,970
Speaker 3:  theater that's always empty and a little scary.

699
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,590
Speaker 5:  That's actually a really good example, right? Because there is the version

700
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,310
Speaker 5:  of it that it's just like it'll play in a window in front of you, but the

701
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,150
Speaker 5:  cooler version of that is something much more ambitious and has weird theaters.

702
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:55,110
Speaker 5:  Or you can like have it be the, the like Oculus Quest thing

703
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,550
Speaker 5:  where it's like you're in your home and it's playing on a TV in front of

704
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,830
Speaker 5:  you and there's a crackling fire. Like there are big ideas to be had

705
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:04,190
Speaker 5:  there, but like I'd rather have a thing that plays Netflix than nothing that

706
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,090
Speaker 5:  plays Netflix. So I guess I have seen a bunch of developers who are

707
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,940
Speaker 5:  not excited about this idea of it. Like even some who are like,

708
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:15,370
Speaker 5:  I'll, I'll eventually turn this on. But the idea of it being on by default

709
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:19,270
Speaker 5:  and people like discovering their apps for the first time through

710
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:23,110
Speaker 5:  this thing that is thoroughly unoptimized and untested for their app. They're

711
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,270
Speaker 5:  not fans. The

712
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,950
Speaker 7:  Same thing happened with the Apple Silicon Max, right? Like yeah, that's

713
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,750
Speaker 7:  right. Apple had initially pitched if I'm, I could be misremembering it,

714
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,580
Speaker 7:  but I believe the plan was to have all of the iPhone and, and iPad apps

715
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,830
Speaker 7:  just kind of work by default. And then they rolled it back because, and many,

716
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:42,360
Speaker 7:  many developers have opted not to make their apps

717
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,580
Speaker 7:  available on M one Max or, or Apple Silicon

718
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,000
Speaker 7:  Max because the experience really isn't great and they didn't design it for

719
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,480
Speaker 7:  that. And there's a handful that do, but it's very few and far between. And

720
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,760
Speaker 6:  I wouldn't be surprised that same thing happens that that between the time

721
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,360
Speaker 6:  of when we have this $3,500 Vision pro and whenever we get a Vision pro that

722
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,840
Speaker 6:  people actually can buy or want to buy, that policy

723
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,820
Speaker 6:  changes. And also hopefully by then they'll have enough apps to kind of satisfy

724
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,600
Speaker 6:  the people. But for the first initial buyers having

725
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,480
Speaker 6:  a huge app store full of apps that kind of don't work, but you have

726
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,360
Speaker 6:  everything to choose from is fine before you get to the general public actually

727
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,680
Speaker 6:  using this thing, it's

728
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,990
Speaker 5:  A hell of a sales pitch for a $3,500 headset.

729
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:26,560
Speaker 7:  Alright. Just to bring this full circle, do we think we're going to hear

730
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,600
Speaker 7:  anything about the Vision Pro next week? Yes,

731
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,360
Speaker 3:  A hundred percent. I, I like, I, I think David's right that they've got something

732
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,240
Speaker 3:  coming, but I think it's probably less about the phone itself and more

733
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,040
Speaker 3:  about the grand new vision for the next, the

734
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,800
Speaker 3:  future of how we window our ways into the internet. And

735
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,190
Speaker 3:  it's gonna be some stuff

736
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,160
Speaker 6:  When Tim Cook tells us that we can hold up the iPhone to our face, like heads

737
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,880
Speaker 6:  up style and have a Vision Pro right now for $1,099,

738
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,200
Speaker 6:  you're all going to buy one every single day. Yeah.

739
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,560
Speaker 7:  Google Cardboard was a very successful program.

740
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,380
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

741
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,540
Speaker 5:  And it, it too costs a thousand dollars.

742
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,460
Speaker 3:  That's how much the Belkin headset will be.

743
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,440
Speaker 5:  The thing, the thing I've been surprised by is how forthcoming Apple has

744
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,320
Speaker 5:  been in like, letting developers talk about their experiences so

745
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,000
Speaker 5:  far. Like there have been people out there talking about how they've been

746
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,760
Speaker 5:  using it and they haven't said a ton, but they're able to at least like,

747
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:16,960
Speaker 5:  I think

748
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,920
Speaker 7:  Those are very gated experience for Oh for sure. Like, like, like

749
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,480
Speaker 7:  what? Like Apple produced a, a PR blast a few weeks ago Right. That had some

750
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,800
Speaker 7:  developers providing quotes and things like that and like that's all those

751
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,720
Speaker 7:  developers can say about it. Yes. And those like Apple PR

752
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,240
Speaker 5:  Approved quotes. That is true. That's definitely true. But like, it just

753
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Speaker 5:  makes me think of like when the iPad came out, apple literally chained it

754
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,020
Speaker 5:  to people's tables and we'll probably get something like that, but I would

755
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,880
Speaker 5:  bet we're gonna get like a really fun montagey video of the

756
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,480
Speaker 5:  developers playing with the Vision Pro. And that's about all we're gonna

757
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,520
Speaker 5:  get. Alright. Yeah, that's fair. We need to take a break. Dan, can you stick

758
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,920
Speaker 5:  around for a little while longer and talk about some more gadget? Sure. Or

759
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,610
Speaker 5:  do you have to go

760
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,470
Speaker 7:  Happy to join?

761
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,800
Speaker 5:  Okay, good. All right, we're gonna take a quick break, then we're gonna go

762
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,120
Speaker 5:  back and talk about some other stuff. We'll be right

763
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,830
Speaker 5:  back.

764
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,750
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back. Before we get to the Bobs, which I have promised we

765
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:13,470
Speaker 5:  are going to get to very soon, let's just run through some of the other gadgets

766
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:17,430
Speaker 5:  that came out this week before we mercifully let damn go. Does anybody have

767
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,790
Speaker 5:  feelings about GoPro? Like I, I mean this sincerely as a question. GoPro

768
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:24,630
Speaker 5:  launched a new camera and promised other new cameras and

769
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,110
Speaker 5:  I find myself so just cold

770
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:31,950
Speaker 5:  thinking about the existence of a new GoPro camera. It'll

771
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:35,630
Speaker 5:  let you film for longer. It has a new vertical video thing that's all

772
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,370
Speaker 5:  fine, but I just like, does anyone care about

773
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,210
Speaker 5:  GoPros? David,

774
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:44,110
Speaker 6:  Is this, is this Ghost Pros problem or is this your problem? You're a few

775
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:47,870
Speaker 6:  years older than you were the last time they brought out a, a brand new

776
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:48,510
Speaker 6:  phone. Oh no,

777
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:49,650
Speaker 5:  It's GoPro's problem.

778
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,270
Speaker 6:  You maybe are a little less, okay, maybe I am a little

779
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:57,190
Speaker 6:  less sure that I'm going to be doing anything worth filming with a

780
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,190
Speaker 6:  GoPro. Like, like if you just made the list of things that you can do that

781
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:03,950
Speaker 6:  are worth filming with a GoPro like maybe six years ago I had some of those

782
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,990
Speaker 6:  things on the list. Now it's none. It's zero. It's never gonna happen. I

783
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:07,150
Speaker 6:  think

784
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,670
Speaker 7:  That is the lesson of action cameras in general. When they first came out

785
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,250
Speaker 7:  and first were being popular, everybody thought, oh, I could be lifelogging

786
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,830
Speaker 7:  or filming all these crazy adventures and things like that. And then they

787
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,510
Speaker 7:  realized that like, I don't really do anything all that interesting and I

788
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:22,030
Speaker 7:  don't really wanna deal with all this footage and I'm not a video filmmaker

789
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:25,610
Speaker 7:  or whatever. And so what are we up to? Hero

790
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:29,510
Speaker 7:  12, the 12, the 12th GoPro at this point. Like they are

791
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:33,440
Speaker 7:  products for a specific type of filmmaker who

792
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,900
Speaker 7:  is using them to either capture interesting angles

793
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,040
Speaker 7:  or interesting activities or whatever. They're just not

794
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,840
Speaker 7:  general consumer products like they might have thought they would've

795
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,920
Speaker 7:  been five to 10 years ago. Well,

796
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,520
Speaker 3:  I think that I the, like the phone made it hard for them to be general consumer

797
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,960
Speaker 3:  product because the phone camera got, 'cause for a while there you'd be like,

798
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,240
Speaker 3:  okay, well I don't wanna use my phone to film this because my phone's got

799
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,520
Speaker 3:  a crummy camera on it, but the GoPro's got a much nicer

800
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,180
Speaker 3:  camera so it makes sense. And maybe one day I really will go

801
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,020
Speaker 3:  skiing and be able to show everybody my videos. You won't. But like you,

802
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,640
Speaker 3:  you could, you could rationalize that, right? And I think was it, was it

803
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,470
Speaker 3:  like 20 18, 20 19 where suddenly their sales just

804
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:18,400
Speaker 3:  fell off a cliff because everybody was like, I have a GoPro and I'm not

805
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,280
Speaker 3:  as active as you wish I was GoPro and, and like they,

806
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,320
Speaker 3:  they really struggled. They, they, they had a lot of issues. It was around

807
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,040
Speaker 3:  the same time they released their drone that just like flopped because it

808
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,960
Speaker 3:  was busted. Well,

809
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,200
Speaker 6:  They'd gotten huge. You would go to the grocery store and they'd have an

810
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,040
Speaker 6:  end cap for GoPro at at every Walmart in Meyer

811
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,720
Speaker 6:  and whatever. And I'm like, are there that many people living these action

812
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,440
Speaker 6:  camera lifestyles? And it turned out there weren't, I

813
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,280
Speaker 5:  Think, I really think GoPro thought it was like the point

814
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,160
Speaker 5:  and shoot camera of the future. And it, what it

815
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,560
Speaker 5:  seems to me is that like every year the total

816
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,550
Speaker 5:  addressable market of GoPro just gets a little tiny bit smaller

817
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:01,420
Speaker 5:  because it doesn't have new ideas about how you can take

818
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,120
Speaker 5:  photos and video. Like one of the things this time is it's easier to sync

819
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,280
Speaker 5:  time codes if you're shooting with a bunch of GoPros

820
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,080
Speaker 5:  simultaneously. And it's like, that's for 12 people. That's

821
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,280
Speaker 5:  that. That's the number of people who care about that. But then I guess,

822
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,910
Speaker 5:  I dunno, there's a guy in my neighborhood who rides a like old

823
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:22,700
Speaker 5:  Schwinn bike to the train station every morning and he like has

824
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,380
Speaker 5:  on, he's like wearing business casual clothes and he has his messenger bag

825
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,200
Speaker 5:  and he clips a GoPro to his messenger bag and just films his ride to the

826
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,400
Speaker 5:  train station every morning. And every time I see this man, I just wanna

827
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,240
Speaker 5:  stop him and be like, why? Have you ever watched any of these videos? Is

828
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,800
Speaker 7:  He using it as a dash cam? It's a dash cam, yes. In case he gets hit by a

829
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,220
Speaker 7:  car.

830
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:45,200
Speaker 3:  Oh, that's for security. Okay. Yeah, it's a dash cam. Basically GoPros

831
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,040
Speaker 3:  are for people who don't wanna buy a ga dash cam because the dash cam

832
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,040
Speaker 3:  market is super confusing and scary. I definitely don't know that from

833
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,480
Speaker 3:  experience or cyclists who need it. So in

834
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,160
Speaker 3:  case the cop like gives them a ticket for riding in the bike lane, which

835
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,720
Speaker 3:  happens far too often here in New York City. And then

836
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,710
Speaker 3:  Veen like one of our people on our video team who actually

837
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:10,040
Speaker 3:  does use it for like cool stuff. He's always like, yeah, I'm snowboarding

838
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,640
Speaker 3:  this weekend. And I'm like, how do you have the energy,

839
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,350
Speaker 6:  The Thomas Ricker experience as as we call it? Yeah,

840
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:20,180
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The Thomas Ricker experience. There's like, it's those two

841
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:24,060
Speaker 3:  and then and then the folks who need it for a dash cam. And

842
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,280
Speaker 3:  that's the market.

843
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,210
Speaker 7:  I, I mean I think it is smart. If I was GoPro and I didn't really have an

844
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:32,680
Speaker 7:  idea to reinvent this camera or the idea as I tried in the past failed 360

845
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,360
Speaker 7:  video or drones, whatever, I think it's smart to lean into building

846
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,980
Speaker 7:  these higher end features for the niche that is still using the cameras and

847
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,520
Speaker 7:  is still gonna go out and buy them. And we'll sync five GoPro

848
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,840
Speaker 7:  angles together. I

849
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,540
Speaker 3:  Mean it's worked for like Sony, it's worked for kind of

850
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,530
Speaker 3:  red, like going, going more niche does work for cameras

851
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:56,460
Speaker 3:  particular go makes sense because camera nerds

852
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,480
Speaker 3:  be nerding.

853
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,090
Speaker 5:  I think my real issue with GoPro is that we treat it kind of like a

854
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,890
Speaker 5:  mainstream brand and it very much is a mainstream brand. Like their

855
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,680
Speaker 5:  brand recognition I'm sure is ridiculous when in reality, like you

856
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,620
Speaker 5:  said, Cranz, it is basically, it's red, it is a specific device

857
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:16,380
Speaker 5:  for a specific use case and that's fine and

858
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:20,130
Speaker 5:  that's all well and good, but it is so not how

859
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,520
Speaker 5:  GoPro wants you to think about it. That the dissonance of that I think has

860
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,800
Speaker 5:  just always kind of annoyed me.

861
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,160
Speaker 3:  I think they've also struggled with that, right? Like they had a lot of leadership

862
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,000
Speaker 3:  changes and stuff after, after the drone because they were also realizing,

863
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,390
Speaker 3:  oh wait, we're, we're having this turn in our, in our

864
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:39,100
Speaker 3:  company and we're not gonna be able to survive it if we don't fix everything.

865
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,080
Speaker 3:  And so it feels like they have kind of leaned into, we're here for the

866
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,900
Speaker 3:  niche market and I, I think a lot of us are just like, like

867
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,800
Speaker 3:  the p the the news from us was, was written by Verin who is part

868
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,680
Speaker 3:  of that market, right? Like, like I think while our friends and

869
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,360
Speaker 3:  family might still recognize GoPro, none of them have owned them in years,

870
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,070
Speaker 3:  have any desire to own them in years and GoPro is probably okay with that.

871
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think that's probably right. Alright, well that's enough about GoPro.

872
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,630
Speaker 5:  That's, that's all I want to talk about GoPro in the year 2023. Couple

873
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:12,440
Speaker 5:  more things here. So Google did what we talked about

874
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,280
Speaker 5:  last week and assumed it's going to happen just full leak to the

875
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,160
Speaker 5:  Pixel eight Pro Richard. What do we learn? What do we know about the Pixel

876
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,140
Speaker 5:  eight pro?

877
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:24,120
Speaker 6:  It continues to be a phone. They actually today posted You know you've

878
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,280
Speaker 6:  probably seen this by the time you're hearing this. They posted a couple

879
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,420
Speaker 6:  of videos of it, of the Pixel eight Pro and the Pixel eight, which notably

880
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,780
Speaker 6:  the Pixel eight should be quite a bit smaller than the Pixel seven and Pixel

881
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,740
Speaker 6:  six. So if you like small phones, you, you have a good option

882
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,720
Speaker 6:  so you can actually see it. Now we've got some comparisons there. They

883
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,620
Speaker 6:  showed off the second watch which looks a lot like the first watch,

884
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,580
Speaker 6:  but it seems like that's what we're gonna kind of get at the event. Google

885
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:51,440
Speaker 6:  always leaking it stuff. We, we have, we have had the hardware specs, we've

886
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,240
Speaker 6:  heard stuff about the software. They haven't said too much really about what

887
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,440
Speaker 6:  these things do, but we can see them. We can see the camera bar. It's still

888
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,710
Speaker 6:  there. They've, they've got lenses, it's not folding.

889
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,460
Speaker 7:  It's nice to see Google making progress on

890
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,320
Speaker 7:  the, the length of time between when it leaks its own product and its own

891
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,480
Speaker 7:  event. Like we're at one month to the event. That's pretty

892
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,040
Speaker 7:  good. You know a couple years ago it was like they would announce

893
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,000
Speaker 7:  their phone in May and not not launch it till October and

894
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,650
Speaker 7:  they're like, yeah, we got that Pixel five coming, we showed it to you.

895
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:26,560
Speaker 3:  Gotta get ahead of that iPhone hype train like Pixel fans. Don't forget it's

896
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,310
Speaker 3:  coming here it is. the whole thing. Just

897
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:31,390
Speaker 3:  wait a little longer.

898
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,160
Speaker 5:  Richard, I'm just seeing this video you're talking about now for the first

899
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,030
Speaker 5:  time the Pixel eight looks small.

900
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:39,960
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's like 6.1 ish inches is is what the we're

901
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,880
Speaker 6:  talking about. So yeah, small phones are back and we're calling 6.1 inches

902
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,720
Speaker 6:  small now, which

903
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,320
Speaker 5:  We have agreed on this show that is the perfect size for a smartphone as

904
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,920
Speaker 5:  Alison Johnson will say to anyone who asks that is the

905
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,840
Speaker 5:  correct size of smartphone. It's so good job. Google. Yeah that's

906
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,480
Speaker 5:  coming October 4th. I assume we will get six or 700 more

907
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,280
Speaker 5:  leaks before we let you go Dan, run me

908
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,050
Speaker 5:  through the two Bluetooth speakers that came out this week. The

909
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:09,520
Speaker 5:  Sonos move two and the UE epic boom.

910
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,420
Speaker 7:  Technically one of them's not really a Bluetooth speaker but sure

911
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:16,360
Speaker 5:  That's true. Fair enough. Two needlessly expensive wireless

912
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,960
Speaker 5:  speakers, both of which I wanna buy anyway. So here we

913
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,460
Speaker 5:  are.

914
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,360
Speaker 7:  So I'll tell, I'll roll that back a little bit. The the Sonos Move two does

915
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,200
Speaker 7:  support Bluetooth but it's primarily a wifi speaker and it's an update

916
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,000
Speaker 7:  to Sonos first portable speaker. It's got a battery built

917
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,820
Speaker 7:  into it. It's basically if you took the Sonos Arab 100 and stuck a battery

918
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:39,180
Speaker 7:  on the bottom of it, the improvements over the move one

919
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,120
Speaker 7:  are stereo sound now because it's got multiple tweeters and

920
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,510
Speaker 7:  double the battery life. It's also got a slightly different design on top

921
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:50,000
Speaker 7:  with the way you adjust volume or skip tracks and it comes in

922
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,880
Speaker 7:  green and if you read the site, you knew all of this a

923
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,880
Speaker 7:  month ago because Chris Welch leaked all of it and had gotten a huge scoop

924
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,400
Speaker 7:  on it. So, but now it's official, now you can order it, it's 450 bucks, which

925
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,360
Speaker 7:  means it's 50 bucks more expensive than last time. Ah. So how it goes, the

926
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:08,080
Speaker 7:  one weird quirk is it does not support Google Assistant for voice

927
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,040
Speaker 7:  commands because Sonos and Google, as we know and have discussed

928
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,600
Speaker 7:  probably many times don't get along anymore. So voice

929
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,420
Speaker 7:  control is only through Amazon's assistant and Sonos

930
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:23,000
Speaker 7:  own assistant, but you cannot use Google Assistant on it. I believe that's

931
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,480
Speaker 7:  coming out later this month. So that's coming real soon. We'll have a review,

932
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,320
Speaker 7:  all that fun stuff. And then the other thing is a

933
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,840
Speaker 7:  solar powered Bluetooth speaker. Yeah. That you in theory never have to

934
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,840
Speaker 7:  charge from the company that brought us solar powered over ear

935
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,520
Speaker 7:  headphones. It's the same kind of concept. John Porter reported on it

936
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,400
Speaker 7:  from EFA out in Berlin. It's pretty neat.

937
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,660
Speaker 7:  'cause if I know anything about any Bluetooth speaker I've ever owned, they

938
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,360
Speaker 7:  end in a drawer most of the time and then they're always dead when I want

939
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,190
Speaker 7:  to use it. So

940
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:51,840
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it's the best part of 'em.

941
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,840
Speaker 5:  This thing is not attractive. It

942
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,320
Speaker 3:  Looks like a coaster. It

943
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,940
Speaker 7:  Does, yeah. I don't think it's gonna be a banger speaker. No, it's small.

944
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,750
Speaker 5:  But I will say a solar powered Bluetooth speaker is actually like

945
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,040
Speaker 5:  kind of a perfect idea because it's the sort of thing you use outside all

946
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:10,000
Speaker 5:  the time. And so in the way that most solar gadgets are like you, you

947
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,750
Speaker 5:  have to like go out of your way to put them in the sun. This one actually

948
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:16,560
Speaker 5:  kind of tracks, I'm very into this. The one other speaker I would

949
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,460
Speaker 5:  add, and this is just because I am permanently obsessed with this company,

950
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,430
Speaker 5:  is UE Ultima Ears just came out with a new speaker called the Epic

951
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:28,260
Speaker 5:  boom. It's like 350 bucks, it's too expensive, it's

952
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,200
Speaker 5:  big. Youi has kind of like lost its mind with how large a Bluetooth

953
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,900
Speaker 5:  speaker should be. But I continue to think they are the best series

954
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,680
Speaker 5:  of speakers on the market for just like regular ass

955
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,560
Speaker 5:  Bluetooth speakers. I have, I have a wonder Boom, I have a boom, I

956
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,200
Speaker 5:  have a mega boom. They're wonderful. And so I am sure I will end up buying

957
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:47,720
Speaker 5:  this.

958
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,560
Speaker 7:  I just love how they, each one has to like one up the name. Like they started

959
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:55,400
Speaker 7:  with Boom, which is already like a, a big like powerful name. And then

960
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,240
Speaker 7:  they're like, whoa, where do we go from here? Mega boom. Now we're at

961
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,500
Speaker 7:  epic boom. I assume the next step is ultra boom

962
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,800
Speaker 5:  And then Apple sues them out of existence for using the ultra

963
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,630
Speaker 5:  name. Yeah, no, I just, everyone should buy Youi speakers.

964
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,460
Speaker 5:  This is, that's how I feel about, that's how I feel about all this. Alright,

965
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:16,240
Speaker 5:  we should move on. It's time to talk about streaming. Dan, you can stay or

966
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,940
Speaker 5:  you can leave and we will understand. If it's time to go before Bob,

967
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:23,800
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna let you guys have fun. Thank you for having

968
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,180
Speaker 7:  me.

969
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:28,030
Speaker 5:  Thanks buddy. All right, Dan is gone.

970
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:31,470
Speaker 5:  It's time for Bob Talk Alex

971
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:35,360
Speaker 5:  just set the scene here a little bit. We, we have a banger of a C

972
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,440
Speaker 5:  N B C story this week. We have a lot of Bobs to talk

973
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,780
Speaker 5:  about. Catch us up here.

974
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:44,280
Speaker 3:  So a couple of years ago, Bob Iger, then c e o of

975
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,160
Speaker 3:  Disney said, I'm gonna leave, I'm retiring, I'm gonna stay on as

976
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,200
Speaker 3:  executive chairman, but otherwise I'm, I'm gonna go and I'm gonna name this

977
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,880
Speaker 3:  new guy Bob Chapek who used, who's been running our parks and, and run like

978
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,280
Speaker 3:  home video and, and seems to really know the company. He's gonna be running

979
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,070
Speaker 3:  things. Bob Chapek came in immediately got

980
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:05,840
Speaker 3:  like Covid happened. They had to shut down the parks, got

981
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:09,220
Speaker 3:  into a huge fight with Ron DeSantis over whether or not people could say

982
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,100
Speaker 3:  gay in, in Florida. Like got in a

983
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,850
Speaker 3:  fight with Scarlet Johanssen about being paid

984
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,760
Speaker 3:  appropriately for Black Widow because they moved that to have it released

985
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,580
Speaker 3:  on Disney Plus at the same time as theaters. All of this

986
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,340
Speaker 3:  stuff happened. Everybody's like, Chapek seems like kind of a clown, why

987
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,940
Speaker 3:  is he in charge? And then Bob Iger returned and said, Hey, I'm

988
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:34,600
Speaker 3:  here. Don't worry, I'm gonna fix everything. And it seems like he really

989
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,260
Speaker 3:  had, and it was like, wow, what was this huge error in judgment? Who made

990
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:42,130
Speaker 3:  the decision to put Chapek in charge? And aren't we all glad

991
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:46,020
Speaker 3:  Iger is back? And it feels like this. What we found out from the C N

992
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:49,020
Speaker 3:  B C story was it was the same person that did both of those

993
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,770
Speaker 3:  things. Bob Iger, good job, Bob.

994
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:56,740
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I I just wanna focus on like when he left, that was right at the time

995
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,610
Speaker 6:  that we were all kind of reckoning with the idea that, oh, COVID iss a thing.

996
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:04,500
Speaker 6:  This is, this is happening. And like just at the very

997
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,210
Speaker 6:  beginning of that, BA was like, I'm out.

998
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:10,620
Speaker 3:  Just like he like was at that meme of the kid just like turning into

999
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:14,440
Speaker 3:  ghost, like just peace.

1000
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,740
Speaker 3:  And he was gone. Well,

1001
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:19,180
Speaker 5:  And the, I remember even at the time the story was

1002
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:22,310
Speaker 5:  basically Bob Iger is this like Legendarily

1003
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:26,160
Speaker 5:  successful c e o his run at Disney is up there with

1004
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,960
Speaker 5:  anyone's run at any company ever. He bought Pixar, he bought

1005
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,400
Speaker 5:  Marvel, he bought Lucasfilm, Disney was booming, everything was going really

1006
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,080
Speaker 5:  great. And he basically saw the writing on the wall that

1007
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,280
Speaker 5:  was C O V I D and just, just peaced

1008
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,260
Speaker 5:  out. But, but then what seems like happened

1009
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,190
Speaker 5:  is our man never actually left and just

1010
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:51,640
Speaker 5:  continued to be like sneaky shadow c e o. Yeah.

1011
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,200
Speaker 6:  He sold the house and kept living in the attic. Yeah,

1012
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,120
Speaker 3:  Yeah. He didn't even keep living in the attic. He kept living in the master

1013
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:01,110
Speaker 3:  bedroom. He was like, this is not your, your private bathroom. This is

1014
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:04,420
Speaker 3:  mine. But don't worry, you can have the run of the house. You've got everything,

1015
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:08,000
Speaker 3:  but you need to talk to me every day. And if you don't continue to kiss my

1016
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,400
Speaker 3:  ring, then I'm gonna be really upset. And then eventually you're gonna get

1017
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,280
Speaker 3:  kicked out. Like this, this story from from Alex Sherman at C N

1018
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,230
Speaker 3:  B C is just incredible because it is full of like Emma,

1019
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:23,200
Speaker 3:  Emma for, for us rounded up all the petty moments in it because there

1020
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,120
Speaker 3:  are so many petty moments. And what it all boils down to is if

1021
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,640
Speaker 3:  you are ever in a position where the c e o of the company comes to you and

1022
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,440
Speaker 3:  says, I'm gonna promote you to be c e o, but I am gonna be sticking

1023
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,320
Speaker 3:  around as executive chairman and I'm not giving you my office, but it's

1024
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,420
Speaker 3:  totally okay, you are in charge. Do not believe them.

1025
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,660
Speaker 5:  Run. Yeah.

1026
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:46,600
Speaker 3:  Run. Don't take that as a bad job to take. And and that's

1027
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,580
Speaker 3:  what happened. Like he took this job. Iger was micromanaging, he was in things,

1028
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:54,290
Speaker 3:  Chapek was by no means like a saint in all of this. He, he

1029
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:58,280
Speaker 3:  definitely screwed up quite frequently. He didn't know how to handle

1030
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,180
Speaker 3:  talent, but we found out like the Scarlett Johanssen thing, we all thought

1031
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,960
Speaker 3:  it was Chapek just blundering through because he doesn't know how to handle

1032
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,740
Speaker 3:  talent. And it turns out he thought Iger was gonna do it

1033
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,280
Speaker 3:  and Iger was like, no, no, no, I'm not gonna tell him I'm not gonna do it,

1034
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,880
Speaker 3:  but I'm also not gonna do anything. And and then be like, why did you

1035
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,720
Speaker 3:  fail Bob? What, what happened? It was just a lot of

1036
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,100
Speaker 3:  moments like that where he'd be like, I got you, I got you. And then leave

1037
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,610
Speaker 3:  Chapek out to dry and you're like, oh

1038
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,550
Speaker 3:  buddy. Rough.

1039
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:33,520
Speaker 5:  Yeah. He really just kept showing up at

1040
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,290
Speaker 5:  every moment. There was like anytime somebody was to sort of collect an

1041
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:40,560
Speaker 5:  award or like shake hands for doing a great job. Like there's Bob Iger in

1042
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,700
Speaker 5:  a pressed white shirt doing so looking great. And anytime there was like

1043
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,860
Speaker 5:  actual running of the company to do Iger was just nowhere to be found.

1044
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,940
Speaker 6:  No, I'm I'm only here for the fun stuff. Yeah. He, he said, I I'm, I'm the

1045
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,760
Speaker 6:  fun dad. And Chapek is the, the dad who

1046
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,530
Speaker 6:  tells you that you can't go to spring break this year because of Covid.

1047
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,480
Speaker 6:  Sorry.

1048
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,230
Speaker 5:  I mean, and truly some of this stuff is like straight out of succession.

1049
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:06,000
Speaker 5:  Like the metaphor about not leaving the house is like barely a

1050
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,830
Speaker 5:  metaphor because one of the things in the story was that Iger

1051
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:13,630
Speaker 5:  kept his office with a private bathroom and

1052
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:17,490
Speaker 5:  made Chapek have a worse office. So like the

1053
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:21,040
Speaker 5:  CEO's office was just Iger so that he could like shower in the

1054
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,000
Speaker 5:  mornings and he

1055
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,720
Speaker 3:  Was like, you don't want this, you don't like, like the, the story. They're

1056
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,330
Speaker 3:  like, yeah. And then he was like, You know you don't need this office, this

1057
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:30,470
Speaker 3:  don't worry. This is for handling talent. You don't do that. Don't worry.

1058
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:34,420
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And then Iger is like running around behind the scenes

1059
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:38,400
Speaker 5:  tr like undermining Chapek to other executives. He didn't say his

1060
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,950
Speaker 5:  name and his goodbye party. It's like all this stuff would be so

1061
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:45,880
Speaker 5:  like petty and ridiculous if it wasn't like two of the most powerful people

1062
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,040
Speaker 5:  in entertainment just publicly beefing with each other inside of their own

1063
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,340
Speaker 5:  company. It's all so ridiculous.

1064
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:56,140
Speaker 3:  The part where he, he finally says, I'm leaving as, as

1065
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:00,080
Speaker 3:  I'm gone. I, I've given you the reins Chapek, I'm gonna go sit over

1066
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,400
Speaker 3:  here next to my friend Steven Spielberg. You're gonna sit at the opposite

1067
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,430
Speaker 3:  end of the table. And I am not gonna mention you

1068
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:09,940
Speaker 3:  once when like just the

1069
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,720
Speaker 3:  that's mean man. That's like Cole, I I absolutely

1070
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,360
Speaker 3:  respect it. Bob Iger now terrifies me completely, but

1071
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:21,150
Speaker 3:  like, oh, that was good. Poor Bob. I feel

1072
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,180
Speaker 3:  poor Bob, you don't even know which Bob I'm talking about.

1073
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,400
Speaker 5:  No, Bob looks good in this story. All the bobs lose. What's

1074
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,800
Speaker 3:  Funny is the same thing kind of happened. So when Michael Eisner, who was

1075
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,560
Speaker 3:  the c e o before Iger and he

1076
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,040
Speaker 3:  originally came on and everybody was like, oh wow, he's gonna change the

1077
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,600
Speaker 3:  whole thing. He was brought in by, by, by these guys, these investors in

1078
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,760
Speaker 3:  the eighties and everybody was like, wow, he's gonna change Disney. And he

1079
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,200
Speaker 3:  did not change Disney. And then he was like, I'm gonna name my own

1080
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,740
Speaker 3:  successor who's gonna happen to have the exact same first name as me and

1081
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:54,360
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna do exactly what Bob Iger would end up doing. And everybody at the

1082
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:58,280
Speaker 3:  time was like, you cannot do that. You're dumb and we

1083
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,100
Speaker 3:  all hate you. Please leave Michael Eisner as quickly as possible. And Bob

1084
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,640
Speaker 3:  got to get got away with it because Bob Iger is so much

1085
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,480
Speaker 3:  more charming and everybody's like, he got, he got us Marvel, he got

1086
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,810
Speaker 3:  us Lucas Arts like, do whatever you want,

1087
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:16,350
Speaker 3:  Bob. You want three more offices, we'll build them. That didn't happen in

1088
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:18,450
Speaker 3:  the story, but I assume that's happening somewhere right now.

1089
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:22,190
Speaker 5:  But now he's back, he just signed another contract to be

1090
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:25,830
Speaker 5:  Disney, c e o through 2026. He has claimed he

1091
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:29,260
Speaker 5:  will have his actual

1092
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:33,150
Speaker 5:  successor You know solved by then. But I kind of feel like

1093
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:36,840
Speaker 5:  Bob Iger is like in the middle of just ruining his own

1094
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,790
Speaker 5:  reputation. Like he truly went out like a

1095
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:44,230
Speaker 5:  plus c e o, like Mount Rushmore of good

1096
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:48,190
Speaker 5:  entertainment business, CEOs Bob Iger. And I feel like now is

1097
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,830
Speaker 5:  just like speed running his own demise in a lot of ways. He's

1098
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:55,230
Speaker 3:  Pulling what was, there's the football player who just keeps

1099
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:58,790
Speaker 6:  Going. Well I think the, the comparison is Jordan on the Wizards and, and

1100
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:02,510
Speaker 6:  I think in a very, in a very specific way is that Jordan on the Wizards is

1101
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:06,110
Speaker 6:  not Jordan on the Bulls for a lot of reasons, but Jordan on the Wizards is

1102
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:09,910
Speaker 6:  still like 25 and eight and like still an all star

1103
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:13,750
Speaker 6:  level player. And Bob Iger is still Bob Iger doing his his

1104
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:17,590
Speaker 6:  things, but it's just not like it was before. He, you you, you're never

1105
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:20,440
Speaker 6:  gonna go out on top with three pointer at the end of the game to win the

1106
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,920
Speaker 6:  championship. It just does not happen again. Now you're the guy who's gonna

1107
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,400
Speaker 6:  have to try and figure out a way to launch standalone E S P N and probably

1108
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,720
Speaker 6:  sell Disney's cable channels and dismantle the whole thing that you built.

1109
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,150
Speaker 6:  Congratulations.

1110
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:36,100
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like retire Bob. But just, just let it go.

1111
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:40,030
Speaker 3:  Let somebody else pick your successor because that, that was the other wild

1112
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:43,940
Speaker 3:  part of this is that he didn't actually know Bob Chapek very well. He,

1113
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:47,320
Speaker 3:  he, there was other people that they thought were were gonna be the next

1114
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,760
Speaker 3:  c e o including the guy who was running Disney Plus. And everybody's like,

1115
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,280
Speaker 3:  oh yeah, it's gonna be him. And so when he was announced Bob Chapek, everybody's

1116
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,240
Speaker 3:  like, wait, the guy who runs parks, like that's

1117
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,800
Speaker 3:  who you're going with. And then even he was realizing,

1118
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,560
Speaker 3:  wait, who am I going with? 'cause he like had Bob, he was like, okay, we're

1119
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,360
Speaker 3:  gonna fly down to this big meeting shareholder meeting. You're gonna talk

1120
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:10,600
Speaker 3:  to a bunch of execs and stuff. It's gonna be great. You've never done it

1121
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:14,120
Speaker 3:  before. The only time you've ever attended this event was at the invitation

1122
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,660
Speaker 3:  of someone else and you sat in the audience, you're now gonna run the

1123
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:21,600
Speaker 3:  entire thing. Why do you wanna go to the back and study and

1124
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,820
Speaker 3:  read everything when you can just sit here and talk to me and I'll explain

1125
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:28,420
Speaker 3:  to you how to do it all. And he got really upset because Chapek was like,

1126
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:32,040
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna go study because Chapek is that kind of guy. And I think a lot

1127
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,940
Speaker 3:  of people would be in that situation and Iger was like, but I am a font

1128
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:39,830
Speaker 3:  of wisdom. Why do you not listen to me? And then he

1129
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:43,120
Speaker 3:  like, after Chapek went back to study was like walking around the plane being

1130
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:47,020
Speaker 3:  like, who is this guy? Like doesn't he get it?

1131
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:50,840
Speaker 3:  And it's like, oh, you shouldn't be asking that question at this point in

1132
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,740
Speaker 3:  the game.

1133
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,560
Speaker 6:  He hired a nerd and then he was surprised that the nerd trusted the book

1134
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,550
Speaker 6:  instead of the person.

1135
01:03:57,550 --> 01:03:59,130
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like

1136
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,680
Speaker 6:  Could have told you that was gonna happen buddy.

1137
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,230
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah. It was one of those things where it just feels like

1138
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:07,650
Speaker 3:  Iger ego caught up.

1139
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:11,600
Speaker 5:  What's interesting about this is this is a really consistent

1140
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,550
Speaker 5:  story in the world. Like the number of CEOs who

1141
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:19,390
Speaker 5:  have tried in various ways to detach and

1142
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:22,670
Speaker 5:  then have found themselves unable to go away. I mean like this is the

1143
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:26,580
Speaker 5:  story of Larry Page and Sergey Bryn who like

1144
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:30,430
Speaker 5:  want to go away and just like be weird billionaires, but then every time

1145
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:33,090
Speaker 5:  anything happens they're like, we have to start coming to the office again.

1146
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:37,030
Speaker 5:  And like Mark Zuckerberg was starting to detach from a lot of day-to-day

1147
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:40,880
Speaker 5:  running of Meta and then came way back in. It's really given me like

1148
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,650
Speaker 5:  great respect for Jeff Bezos who just was like, Andy Chassis's in charge,

1149
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:48,150
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna go to music festivals. And is just like, now he just goes to music

1150
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:51,050
Speaker 5:  festivals, he's and has a yacht like he's doing it right and everybody else

1151
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:53,270
Speaker 5:  should probably learn from Bezos.

1152
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:57,200
Speaker 3:  I I hope Tim Cook re like, 'cause Tim Cook is coming up. We, we we're,

1153
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,340
Speaker 3:  we're increasingly talking about who's gonna be the next c e o of Apple.

1154
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:03,830
Speaker 3:  He's, he's starting to like make those noises. It's gonna happen in the next

1155
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:07,790
Speaker 3:  few years and he just needs to read this story like four

1156
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:11,140
Speaker 3:  times in a row to make sure this doesn't happen to him. Because

1157
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,990
Speaker 3:  it's similar situation of this is one of the first CEOs coming

1158
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:18,950
Speaker 3:  into a company that has largely been like managed by people who came up

1159
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:22,600
Speaker 3:  with the company. And that makes it really, really

1160
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,460
Speaker 3:  difficult. And so I'm just really, really curious

1161
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:30,390
Speaker 3:  to see how we see some of these tech CEO e successions that are coming,

1162
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:34,080
Speaker 3:  that are on the horizon happen after this Just disastrous

1163
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,020
Speaker 3:  Disney one. Totally.

1164
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:39,880
Speaker 5:  So is there a, do we have a leader in the Clubhouse for who would be

1165
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:43,520
Speaker 5:  insane enough to be the next Disney c e o? Like part of me wants to

1166
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:47,470
Speaker 5:  say no one in their right mind would be Bob

1167
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:51,120
Speaker 5:  Iger next successor. Like it's, it's just a suicide mission. But then

1168
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:55,020
Speaker 5:  like whatever Lindy Aino took the job as c e o of Twitter. Like

1169
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,000
Speaker 5:  people will take jobs.

1170
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,640
Speaker 3:  There's always someone hungry enough. Yeah. Like call me up. I, if somebody

1171
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,200
Speaker 3:  called me today and was like, do you wanna be the next c e o of Disney? I'd

1172
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,840
Speaker 3:  be like, yeah, all right, let's go. You get

1173
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,710
Speaker 6:  To go to the parks for free, right? I'm in.

1174
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:08,270
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I was like, I get to go to the parks for free and do I get screeners

1175
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:11,060
Speaker 3:  done? Cheapest. C e o they ever hired,

1176
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:14,440
Speaker 5:  That's how You know you're qualified screeners and park passes. That's the,

1177
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,500
Speaker 5:  that's the corporate perks Cranz is here for.

1178
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,280
Speaker 6:  But that seems like that's how he picked Bob Chapek. He looked around and

1179
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,000
Speaker 6:  he f and he found a guy, he was like, You know what? I think you're desperate

1180
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,920
Speaker 6:  enough that you will not be independent. You will just do what I wanna

1181
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,200
Speaker 6:  do. And he was wrong. Yep. And that was what made him

1182
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,240
Speaker 6:  unhappy. That

1183
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,440
Speaker 3:  Was the best part of it is like he really thought he was gonna just get a

1184
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,580
Speaker 3:  yes man and not somebody who would actually go run the company in their image.

1185
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:40,080
Speaker 3:  And then the guy immediately went and was like, I'm gonna turn, we're a tech

1186
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,720
Speaker 3:  company, we have an enormous streaming service, I'm turning us into a tech

1187
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,600
Speaker 3:  company. And everybody screamed and cried. Chapek to his

1188
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:51,240
Speaker 3:  discredit did also put his old friend in charge

1189
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:55,050
Speaker 3:  of all film and TV at the company. And the guy had zero

1190
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:58,360
Speaker 3:  experience in that space. So like he was by no

1191
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:02,280
Speaker 3:  means a saint. He he was definitely screwing up his fair

1192
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,940
Speaker 3:  share of things without Iger intervention one way or the other. Yeah.

1193
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,760
Speaker 5:  But he was also just being like subtly knifed every time he

1194
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,750
Speaker 5:  did anything. Yeah.

1195
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:14,400
Speaker 3:  Like every time he like that was probably why he put that guy in charge is

1196
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,960
Speaker 3:  he felt he had no one to trust, he had no authority. He was like, I

1197
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:21,880
Speaker 3:  need some control. And so it just became this big power struggle.

1198
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,560
Speaker 5:  I need someone to sit with in the executive dining room. He

1199
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:28,080
Speaker 3:  Needed friends at the Iger going away party who would talk to him. Okay.

1200
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,710
Speaker 3:  Yeah, exactly. Like, because Scar Joe wasn't going to,

1201
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:35,600
Speaker 5:  This is true. Alright, we should just, we should blow through some more streaming

1202
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,370
Speaker 5:  news here real fast. Can we just pour one out really fast for Quibi again,

1203
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:42,350
Speaker 5:  which appears to be yet again

1204
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:46,040
Speaker 5:  dead Roku did some layoffs and is

1205
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,730
Speaker 5:  getting rid of a bunch of its streaming content, which in all likelihood

1206
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:51,740
Speaker 5:  means Quibi shows.

1207
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,650
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna miss the Gold Arms show.

1208
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:57,360
Speaker 6:  Maybe some of them, and not all of them, the, the Gold Arm probably had it

1209
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,200
Speaker 6:  for the chopping block, but there was a story by a variety today where they

1210
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,840
Speaker 6:  said that they had some sources of whatever who said that the shows that

1211
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:07,120
Speaker 6:  are getting chopped are the ones that weren't bringing in that like new subscribers

1212
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:11,020
Speaker 6:  weren't watching. So stuff like the Kevin Hart show might stick around

1213
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:14,580
Speaker 6:  or or other stuff that actually brought in that brought in some new viewers

1214
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:18,320
Speaker 6:  is it's the the the long tail stuff that that's definitely going. So yeah,

1215
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,280
Speaker 6:  quibi dies a thousand deaths.

1216
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:24,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You can't, you can't fully kill Quibi because Quibi was never

1217
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,440
Speaker 5:  fully alive You know what I mean? It's Yeah. But you

1218
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,120
Speaker 3:  Can kill it repeatedly.

1219
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,990
Speaker 5:  Right? You can, you can stab it over and over and over again.

1220
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:34,380
Speaker 5:  YouTube is doing some interesting stuff.

1221
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:38,280
Speaker 3:  The advertising stuff that YouTube is doing right now is interesting 'cause

1222
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,030
Speaker 3:  it sounds like they just rediscovered tv.

1223
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:44,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Wait, get walk us through this. 'cause that was my read too. It's like,

1224
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,400
Speaker 5:  oh, YouTube is just going to be a television channel, but like, explain what's

1225
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,160
Speaker 5:  going on. YouTube

1226
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,800
Speaker 3:  Is now experimenting with a longer block of

1227
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:55,720
Speaker 3:  advertising in the middle of the video you watch rather than

1228
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,600
Speaker 3:  like You know 15 second ads half cutting up the

1229
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,500
Speaker 3:  video or one big ad at the beginning. And if you will recall, if you

1230
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,260
Speaker 3:  are a person who still watches TV or have seen or TV

1231
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:11,190
Speaker 3:  on TikTok, that ads happen

1232
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:14,550
Speaker 3:  in the middle and we have ad breaks and that's when you go to the bathroom

1233
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:18,470
Speaker 3:  and get more water and see how fast you can run. And,

1234
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:22,330
Speaker 3:  and YouTube I guess is doing that. I love it. I, it just cracks

1235
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:26,190
Speaker 3:  me up that YouTube was like, we did a whole bunch of research and,

1236
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:30,160
Speaker 3:  and we, like, we looked at the data and apparently people

1237
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,870
Speaker 3:  like regular scheduled breaks for advertisements

1238
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,850
Speaker 3:  rather than chaotic random moments for

1239
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:38,390
Speaker 3:  advertisements.

1240
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:40,270
Speaker 5:  Who would've thunk knew

1241
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:40,950
Speaker 3:  Who would've thought,

1242
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:44,640
Speaker 6:  Except for everyone who has ever watched tv. The other thing that they announced

1243
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,370
Speaker 6:  basically on the same day was that they are simplifying ad controls for

1244
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:51,110
Speaker 6:  creators a k a, they're taking away a bunch of the options that creators

1245
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:54,850
Speaker 6:  had for like placing where the ads would go in their videos, which does not

1246
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:58,090
Speaker 6:  seem to be the same thing as this, but seems very closely linked because

1247
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:01,490
Speaker 6:  it came at the exact same time and enables them to put the ads at regular

1248
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:04,330
Speaker 6:  intervals wherever they want and not let you the person making the video

1249
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:06,690
Speaker 6:  choose. So you're just gonna have to get used to it. You're gonna have to

1250
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:10,570
Speaker 6:  get used to that like 18 minute t You know TV show. Oh, I

1251
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:14,500
Speaker 6:  know when the ad is coming up. I know when the plot point in my three camera

1252
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:18,360
Speaker 6:  drama is coming up because the advert, the ad is about to come in.

1253
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,170
Speaker 3:  It's gonna be right now, it's gonna be like in a MrBeast video right before

1254
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:24,970
Speaker 3:  the big reveal. It's gonna be a hold, do

1255
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:28,740
Speaker 3:  you take Nutria or whatever, like just

1256
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:32,650
Speaker 3:  right there. Just what, and it's gonna be great. And I think it, honestly,

1257
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:36,210
Speaker 3:  I think that's great. Like it's super annoying when you're watching a

1258
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:40,130
Speaker 3:  show on YouTube or on a lot of the streaming services who are doing the

1259
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:43,470
Speaker 3:  exact same ad presentation that YouTube does where it's just like suddenly

1260
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:47,010
Speaker 3:  in the middle. Like somebody would be like, I don't love, Hey

1261
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:50,940
Speaker 3:  guys, do you need this? And you're like, what the hell are you? Like, pick

1262
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:54,860
Speaker 3:  your moments. And TV was really good at picking those moments, even for

1263
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:57,380
Speaker 3:  stuff that wasn't built for tv, they were still good at being like, okay,

1264
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:00,160
Speaker 3:  we're gonna cut it, we're gonna take it at the right ad break right moment.

1265
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,860
Speaker 3:  And it's like, yeah, every, you should all be doing that. Like, just tell

1266
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:07,490
Speaker 3:  me where I need to put the ad break in my YouTube video. When I upload it,

1267
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:11,260
Speaker 3:  I'll tell you where I want it. You put 40 minutes of ads in

1268
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:15,200
Speaker 3:  there, you make money. I make money and the audience gets a nice

1269
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:15,710
Speaker 3:  bathroom break

1270
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:18,960
Speaker 6:  When, when I press play, I know when I'm going to be able to get up and and

1271
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,550
Speaker 6:  do something else for a sec.

1272
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:24,240
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I I think that's like for for users it's really

1273
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:28,120
Speaker 3:  good. You know you still have to watch ads. That sucks. But like for the

1274
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:32,000
Speaker 3:  user, it's, it's, I think it's a much nicer experience and I hope

1275
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,400
Speaker 3:  that the other streamers who are all experimenting like Netflix, come on

1276
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:39,120
Speaker 3:  man, you gotta, you gotta get on this ad train and not just deliver 'em at

1277
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,920
Speaker 3:  the most random moments possible because it's miserable, but it's gonna require

1278
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,640
Speaker 3:  work. And I think it's like that's something that they typically shy away

1279
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,600
Speaker 3:  from, right? Like they wanna avoid that labor. That's, that's why they're

1280
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,480
Speaker 3:  there and not on TV and film. And so that, that

1281
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,960
Speaker 3:  additional work, it's gonna be interesting to see who does that and how they

1282
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,030
Speaker 3:  do it and how expensive it actually is.

1283
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:02,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I do wonder like we, we talk a lot about how these sort of platform

1284
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,640
Speaker 5:  incentives change the way that content gets made. I suspect this is gonna

1285
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,000
Speaker 5:  do that too. Like I think Richard what you were saying earlier is, is

1286
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,680
Speaker 5:  like absolutely going to be correct that now if

1287
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:17,540
Speaker 5:  there's one big mid-roll ad

1288
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:21,520
Speaker 5:  or one set of mid-roll ads, what you as the creator have to

1289
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,440
Speaker 5:  do now is set it up so spectacularly well that I

1290
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,200
Speaker 5:  have no choice but to stick around through five minutes of ads in order to

1291
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,560
Speaker 5:  get to the second half of the video. Because that's how you get paid. That's

1292
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,510
Speaker 5:  how YouTube gets paid. That's how you juice the algorithm. Like the

1293
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:40,400
Speaker 5:  cliffhanger stuff we're gonna start to see from people just to

1294
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,080
Speaker 5:  get you through the ad break is gonna be so, so, so

1295
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,620
Speaker 5:  intense. And it really is. It's very like 1990s

1296
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:50,910
Speaker 5:  sitcom and Action Network TV show.

1297
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:54,480
Speaker 5:  Like there's just gonna be something bonkers that

1298
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,320
Speaker 5:  happens after eight minutes and then like

1299
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,760
Speaker 5:  somebody's gonna be like, you're his father and then it's gonna be like

1300
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,240
Speaker 5:  breaks.

1301
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,880
Speaker 3:  I want that like soap opera, dun dun, like literally

1302
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,860
Speaker 5:  Like that's, I think that's coming, yes, because it's, it's gonna be

1303
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:13,760
Speaker 5:  so hard to get people through that, but that's where all the money is gonna

1304
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,720
Speaker 5:  be, is in that middle ad break. Whereas now there's the You know, the, the

1305
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,840
Speaker 5:  pre-roll stuff gets you some of the way and the mid-roll stuff happens at

1306
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,720
Speaker 5:  these dynamic places. And so you can 15 seconds at a time, it's a little

1307
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:28,040
Speaker 5:  easier to get people through, but it's like a five minute ad break or a two

1308
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:31,330
Speaker 5:  minute ad break or even like a 92nd ad break in the middle of a YouTube

1309
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:35,200
Speaker 5:  video is just an invitation to stop watching that YouTube video. And

1310
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,410
Speaker 5:  so I think what folks try to do to get you through that is just gonna be

1311
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:40,680
Speaker 5:  weird and fascinating.

1312
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,920
Speaker 3:  I think it's gonna be also interesting for those of us who, like you sit

1313
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,080
Speaker 3:  in bed and you're watching YouTube wind it down at night, even though you

1314
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,720
Speaker 3:  should not be doing that, that's a terrible way to wind down. But you're

1315
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,760
Speaker 3:  still doing it and you're like, oh, I gotta go to like go grab some more

1316
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,080
Speaker 3:  water or something. I gotta go to like, I need to go do a, a little errand

1317
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,800
Speaker 3:  right before I go to sleep. And now you'll be like, oh, ad break. Fling

1318
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,720
Speaker 3:  your iPad across the, the bed, rush up and get your water, do your bed, like

1319
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:06,200
Speaker 3:  brush your teeth, get it all done and then you're back and you can finish

1320
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,830
Speaker 3:  watching your video. That sounds great. And you find out who is the father.

1321
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:11,150
Speaker 3:  Hopefully

1322
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:14,620
Speaker 5:  Every YouTube channel just becomes about who is the father. It's

1323
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,580
Speaker 3:  Just mor ve every, it's just mor ve well

1324
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,020
Speaker 6:  Be And I think that's the other part of it is not only do they need to have

1325
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,460
Speaker 6:  kind of the the cliffhanger, but they also have to have the part leading

1326
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,250
Speaker 6:  up. Like they have to have a video that you don't want to just skip through.

1327
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:29,260
Speaker 6:  Like you have to watch the first, you have to want to watch the first five

1328
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:32,860
Speaker 6:  minutes or however many until the break and then, and then stick around.

1329
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:35,450
Speaker 6:  And that's just gonna be kind of a, a very different construction.

1330
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:39,180
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I wonder if that like that kind of style of YouTube

1331
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:42,260
Speaker 3:  videos now where it's constantly going, constantly pushing because it has

1332
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:46,240
Speaker 3:  to get you through all those tiny little 15 second ad breaks if that's gonna

1333
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,020
Speaker 3:  soften. 'cause that pace is so frenetic and you're seeing like a whole

1334
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:53,880
Speaker 3:  generation of people coming up and that's the pacing they're used to,

1335
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,400
Speaker 3:  to the point where they're like, people talk too slow and stuff like that.

1336
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:00,100
Speaker 3:  And I wonder if we're gonna, if that's gonna stop, if instead

1337
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,980
Speaker 3:  like 40 years from now we're gonna be like, man generation alpha talks so

1338
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:06,900
Speaker 3:  fast, what's up with that? We're all back in the, today they had 15 and

1339
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,330
Speaker 3:  second ad breaks every two minutes.

1340
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:12,820
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And they're all watching videos at like 1.5 x speed. So they just learn

1341
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:14,700
Speaker 5:  that that's how people talk. Yeah.

1342
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:17,460
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's, and everybody else is gonna be like normal and these guys are

1343
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:20,740
Speaker 3:  gonna be like, this is normal. Right. We're fine. That's my generation alpha

1344
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:20,930
Speaker 3:  voice.

1345
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:24,020
Speaker 5:  That was really good. And they're all holding a screen apparently, which

1346
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:24,650
Speaker 5:  I liked.

1347
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:27,460
Speaker 3:  Yeah, apparently. Well because the, the head, the headsets didn't take

1348
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:30,530
Speaker 3:  off. I'm sorry. I'm sorry Tim.

1349
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:33,620
Speaker 6:  Another part of what's changing is the way that these controls happen and

1350
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:37,140
Speaker 6:  when you have these dynamically inserted ads, like the people who direct

1351
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,860
Speaker 6:  these videos who are used to laying out the different pacing and where the

1352
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:43,460
Speaker 6:  things go now, they don't necessarily have as much control over where the

1353
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:47,100
Speaker 6:  ads pop up. So they're handing over control over to YouTube maybe

1354
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,840
Speaker 6:  depending on the length, maybe depending on what ads YouTube has sold.

1355
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:54,730
Speaker 6:  And they're gonna have to edit and direct these videos and then hope

1356
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:58,140
Speaker 6:  that YouTube picks the right points that everything works out properly. So

1357
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:58,340
Speaker 6:  they're

1358
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:01,690
Speaker 3:  Gonna do like the cliffhanger and then they might get the cliffhanger

1359
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:05,620
Speaker 3:  spoiled and then cut to ad break because it was

1360
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:09,580
Speaker 3:  like two seconds too long and the algorithm was like, no, no,

1361
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:13,500
Speaker 3:  no, no, it's gotta go here. Ooh, that's brutal. That's

1362
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,860
Speaker 3:  brutal. Never. That's that's gonna make it rough. That's that's bad YouTube

1363
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:20,620
Speaker 3:  don't do that. Yeah. I, I feel like that's a big tweak. Like

1364
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:23,800
Speaker 3:  just tell people where their ad bricks are gonna go. Let them insert them

1365
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,080
Speaker 3:  or

1366
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,720
Speaker 5:  Let people choose. Right. You can, you can, right. Yeah. Build your own structure

1367
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:31,500
Speaker 5:  if you have three or four ads and you can choose where they go as opposed

1368
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,980
Speaker 5:  to just saying right in the middle there's going to be a large ad break,

1369
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:37,350
Speaker 5:  build your whole thing around that. So it's like you only have sort of one

1370
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:40,660
Speaker 5:  shape of thing you're allowed to make at that point. I do wonder if this

1371
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:44,490
Speaker 5:  is gonna make people come up with lots of different new

1372
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:48,050
Speaker 5:  ways of making money. I think a lot of these folks have, I mean

1373
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:51,160
Speaker 5:  everybody still does the like branded videos and they'll have the one chapter

1374
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,380
Speaker 5:  in their video. That's just where they talk about how cool their sponsor

1375
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:56,940
Speaker 5:  is. It's particularly big on tech. YouTube has been my experience at least

1376
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:59,940
Speaker 5:  where they're like, this video is brought to you by Skillshare. 'cause it's

1377
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:03,630
Speaker 5:  always Skillshare and then they go back to telling you about You know whatever

1378
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:07,500
Speaker 5:  weird stuff they brought on Temu this week. But maybe like, this is

1379
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,370
Speaker 5:  how product placement comes in in an even bigger way. Maybe there are other

1380
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:14,960
Speaker 5:  kinds of like built-in ad formats that people are gonna start to use. It's

1381
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,520
Speaker 5:  gonna be really interesting to see how this goes. Also,

1382
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:22,340
Speaker 5:  this continues to make me glad that I pay for YouTube premium because

1383
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:25,440
Speaker 5:  ads are a nightmare and YouTube ads are a

1384
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,440
Speaker 5:  particularly pernicious nightmare.

1385
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,840
Speaker 3:  I didn't know I paid for YouTube premium for years 'cause I paid through

1386
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,710
Speaker 3:  it through the weirdest of things. Google music.

1387
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:38,520
Speaker 3:  Like I, I was a Google Music subscriber. There are

1388
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:38,920
Speaker 6:  Dozens of

1389
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,820
Speaker 3:  Us. Yeah, there were. It's just me and Richard just hanging out, share

1390
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:45,000
Speaker 3:  the same two songs over and over again. We

1391
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,080
Speaker 6:  Have comments now. Yeah.

1392
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,220
Speaker 3:  I thought they closed Google Music

1393
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:49,430
Speaker 6:  Or Well, on YouTube music.

1394
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:52,760
Speaker 3:  Okay. Yeah. I didn't, I I I couldn't stand the switch. So when it was switched

1395
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,660
Speaker 3:  over to YouTube music, I was like, I'm done. It's Google Music or nothing.

1396
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:59,720
Speaker 3:  And, and I canceled it and then I was like, where did all these ads come

1397
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,480
Speaker 3:  from on YouTube for like a full week. I was like, something's going on with

1398
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,160
Speaker 3:  the algorithm. I'm seeing a lot more ads. No, I'm just down every

1399
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,540
Speaker 6:  Time I open a YouTube video in the wrong window, I'm like, what

1400
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,210
Speaker 6:  Advertisements

1401
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:10,560
Speaker 5:  Awful.

1402
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,870
Speaker 6:  They put these on YouTube. It,

1403
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:15,530
Speaker 5:  It's crazy. I swear YouTube Premium gets like a dollar more expensive

1404
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:19,200
Speaker 5:  every two weeks and I, I don't know what the number is, but I'll stop paying

1405
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,920
Speaker 5:  it, but I'm still paying it now. I

1406
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,710
Speaker 3:  Don't want you to find that number.

1407
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:26,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I don't either. Yeah. You two, please stop. I don't, I'm good. I

1408
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,760
Speaker 5:  pay you enough money. We're we're cool. Alright, we gotta take one more break

1409
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,230
Speaker 5:  and then we're gonna come back. We're gonna do a lightning round. We're already

1410
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:34,840
Speaker 5:  long. We're gonna come back. We're gonna do lightning rounds then we'll get

1411
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:35,560
Speaker 5:  outta here. We'll be right

1412
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:40,700
Speaker 5:  back.

1413
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:26,160
Speaker 2:  Alright,

1414
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:29,390
Speaker 5:  We're back you guys. We have to do this lightning run really fast because

1415
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:32,820
Speaker 5:  I have to go do daycare pickup. That's just a real thing. And if I'm late

1416
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:35,050
Speaker 5:  they charge me money. It's very intense. We

1417
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:35,710
Speaker 3:  We don't want that. We

1418
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:37,550
Speaker 5:  Don't want that. No. So we're just gonna blast through this and get outta

1419
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:40,790
Speaker 5:  here. Cranz, your lightning round choice happens to be a perfect transition

1420
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:43,230
Speaker 5:  from what we were just talking about. So you go first. Yes.

1421
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:46,550
Speaker 3:  Favorite thing. I'm talking about MrBeast all the time now because my godsons

1422
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:49,630
Speaker 3:  are both really, really into him and I have very strong conflicted feelings

1423
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:53,030
Speaker 3:  about that and spent a lot of time telling his mom, sending her like hit

1424
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:56,910
Speaker 3:  pieces about MrBeast saying don't do it. But anyway, MrBeast has

1425
01:20:56,910 --> 01:21:00,550
Speaker 3:  a new YouTube face because he started doing AB

1426
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:04,430
Speaker 3:  testing for the thumbnails and found that more people finished the

1427
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:08,290
Speaker 3:  video when he closed his mouth in the thumbnail.

1428
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:12,070
Speaker 3:  And I guess that's how statistics work. That's how he is treated.

1429
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:12,310
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

1430
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:14,270
Speaker 5:  Like I was just gonna say, is this science, this

1431
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:17,190
Speaker 3:  Is one of those things where normally you would be like, that sounds like

1432
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:20,700
Speaker 3:  a bad reason to do that. That is probably not the actual factor. But

1433
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:24,110
Speaker 3:  notable here is MrBeast is really, really, really, really, really good

1434
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:28,070
Speaker 3:  at juicing the algorithm, the YouTube algorithm. That is why he is like

1435
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:32,010
Speaker 3:  the most popular YouTuber. He knows how to make that thing tick.

1436
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:35,990
Speaker 3:  So he is probably like, he probably is onto something and we're probably

1437
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:39,770
Speaker 3:  gonna see a lot less just wide mouth open

1438
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:43,460
Speaker 3:  on YouTube. And I for 1:00 AM thrilled. So wait,

1439
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,950
Speaker 3:  MrBeast, whatever you think about him. Great job. I've

1440
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:49,110
Speaker 6:  Definitely seen the inside of enough people's mouths in YouTube thumbnails.

1441
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:52,910
Speaker 3:  It just, you don't need the tonsils. Like just No, I don't need it. Yeah.

1442
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:55,350
Speaker 5:  'cause there is, I mean everybody knows what you mean by YouTube face, right?

1443
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:59,110
Speaker 5:  Like I, I can close my eyes and see it. It's the person in that

1444
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:02,450
Speaker 5:  sort of like half smile, half scream face all the time.

1445
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:06,230
Speaker 3:  You'll see us on The Vergecast sometimes, like when they do our art thumbnails.

1446
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:08,670
Speaker 3:  You'll even see I'm doing it right now. You're gonna see it if you watch

1447
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:09,180
Speaker 3:  it on YouTube.

1448
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:12,430
Speaker 5:  It's either that or the furrowed brow where you're kind of like, Hmm, what

1449
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:15,100
Speaker 5:  is this? That's the other YouTube face. Yeah,

1450
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:19,030
Speaker 3:  They're great. So I hope we, we've moved slowly away from

1451
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:22,930
Speaker 3:  that. Maybe we don't need extreme distorted faces to sell a YouTube video.

1452
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:25,030
Speaker 3:  That'd be nice. That's my, that's my hope. We'll

1453
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:28,910
Speaker 5:  See. I am forever fascinated by the like art and science of YouTube

1454
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:32,870
Speaker 5:  thumbnails. Like in terms of things that directly correlate to

1455
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:36,730
Speaker 5:  how much money you make. YouTube thumbnails are about as direct as it gets

1456
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:40,470
Speaker 5:  on the internet and the things people do to build good

1457
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:43,790
Speaker 5:  thumbnails and make them work is just bananas. And

1458
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:44,470
Speaker 3:  They're so horrifying.

1459
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:48,220
Speaker 5:  And you are right that like no one is better at solving this system

1460
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:51,730
Speaker 5:  than MrBeast. So I'm, I'm more inclined to believe him than most, I guess.

1461
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:55,510
Speaker 3:  And he seems very happy about it. He's, he's so happy that like he's gonna

1462
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:59,350
Speaker 3:  have to brush his teeth more but he's not gonna have to show you his

1463
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:02,910
Speaker 5:  Tonsils. Right. He's happy in like a closed mouth way, not an open mouthed

1464
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:03,910
Speaker 5:  way. Yeah. Yeah. Just

1465
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:05,950
Speaker 3:  Like back row smile. Exactly.

1466
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:09,720
Speaker 5:  I'll go next and then Richard you can go My lightning round thing. Do you

1467
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,380
Speaker 5:  guys remember the app Clubhouse?

1468
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:12,300
Speaker 3:  Yes.

1469
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:16,150
Speaker 5:  Did You know before this week that Clubhouse was still in business? Be honest.

1470
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:18,960
Speaker 3:  Yeah, because periodically I check on it. Why? Just to be like you still

1471
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,620
Speaker 3:  around because I would just wanna know. I, I like it can't still be around.

1472
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:26,600
Speaker 3:  And so periodically, like three weeks ago I was like, Clubhouse. Oh

1473
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,470
Speaker 3:  yeah. It's still there.

1474
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:30,200
Speaker 5:  Just like what are the crypto Bross talking about today? Yeah. I'm

1475
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:34,040
Speaker 6:  On Clubhouse every day selling my NFTs. Never stopped, never, never left,

1476
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,790
Speaker 6:  never gave up on Clubhouse. Yeah.

1477
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:39,760
Speaker 5:  Richard's Clubhouse room is bumping y'all. It's

1478
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,720
Speaker 5:  just, oh God. I have, I I have a whole music design for your Clubhouse room.

1479
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,870
Speaker 5:  Richard. We got big plants. It's gonna be amazing. So anyway, so Clubhouse

1480
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:50,720
Speaker 5:  just did a huge like pivot and redesign completely changed the

1481
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:54,530
Speaker 5:  app instead of being the kind of public streaming

1482
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:58,440
Speaker 5:  audio room, I guess is how I would describe it. It was like, what if

1483
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:02,230
Speaker 5:  Twitch but audio sort of

1484
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:05,170
Speaker 3:  That feels right and no games, nothing to watch.

1485
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:08,680
Speaker 5:  Right? And all it was was people yelling about their NFTs and that was the

1486
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:12,600
Speaker 5:  best case scenario anyway. Now Clubhouse us all in on voice

1487
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,280
Speaker 5:  messaging. And so they've like built a bunch of tools where you can one

1488
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:19,880
Speaker 5:  to one or in groups just send voice messages to your

1489
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:23,760
Speaker 5:  friends. And I happen to think like in the abstract, this

1490
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,200
Speaker 5:  is a very good idea. I've been like banging the drum that voice messaging

1491
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,960
Speaker 5:  is a good idea for a long time and history is proving me right? And I feel

1492
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,940
Speaker 5:  very vindicated about it, but I kind of think it's too late

1493
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:38,400
Speaker 5:  for Clubhouse. I sort of hope I'm wrong. 'cause I think like the arc of that

1494
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,360
Speaker 5:  company would be fascinating if it figured it out and came back. But I

1495
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:46,080
Speaker 5:  just think like kudos to Clubhouse for being like, okay, we, we built an

1496
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:50,060
Speaker 5:  audio app that everybody was into for three days when they had to be inside

1497
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:53,100
Speaker 5:  and then instantly forgot about when they were allowed to go outdoors again.

1498
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:56,780
Speaker 5:  And we're gonna find a new thing to do with it that actually feels kind of

1499
01:24:56,780 --> 01:25:00,480
Speaker 5:  honest and on brand with what we wanna be about. And the app

1500
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,600
Speaker 5:  is actually really nice. Again, I don't know anyone who uses it. None of

1501
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,240
Speaker 5:  my friends are there to listen to my voice messages. I must

1502
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:06,060
Speaker 3:  Be like, is it?

1503
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:10,000
Speaker 5:  But it's like as, just as a pure piece of like product design. It's really

1504
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,320
Speaker 5:  nice. They did a good job. It looks nice. I will say, I don't like that you

1505
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:17,100
Speaker 5:  hit the record button and then as soon as you stop it sends the message.

1506
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:17,940
Speaker 5:  No, no,

1507
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:18,440
Speaker 3:  No, no,

1508
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,920
Speaker 5:  No. Anyone who's ever edited this podcast can tell you that that's not how

1509
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,940
Speaker 5:  I roll.

1510
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:27,620
Speaker 6:  The redesigned app I think is perfect for a

1511
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:31,390
Speaker 6:  post-apocalyptic video game where you're experiencing the story through audio

1512
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:34,880
Speaker 6:  logs that people left and they were all chatting in Clubhouse, leaving messages

1513
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,440
Speaker 6:  for each other. Otherwise, I don't think I'm gonna use a specific app for

1514
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,080
Speaker 6:  this. It's gonna be a feature that Facebook or whoever is gonna steal and

1515
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,920
Speaker 6:  it's gonna be built into their apps just like they steal everything else.

1516
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,000
Speaker 6:  So congratulations Clubhouse, but I don't think it's gonna do it. Have

1517
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,220
Speaker 5:  You ever heard of the app Run Zombies? Yes.

1518
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:49,620
Speaker 6:  Yes.

1519
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:50,440
Speaker 5:  So

1520
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,180
Speaker 3:  I tried it once.

1521
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:55,040
Speaker 5:  Run Zombies was the most committed I have ever been to a

1522
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:58,600
Speaker 5:  fitness app. Because basically the idea is you're a

1523
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,950
Speaker 5:  runner who is trying to keep people alive in their

1524
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:05,280
Speaker 5:  zombies. And when you run it just like tells you an audio story and you hear

1525
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:08,200
Speaker 5:  messages from other people and you're running and then it says zombies and

1526
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,020
Speaker 5:  then you run faster. It sounds ridiculous, but like it actually kind of works.

1527
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:14,960
Speaker 5:  And Richard it is precisely what you just described. Like Clubhouse is

1528
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,520
Speaker 5:  just what's happening in your brain in run Zombies only

1529
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,680
Speaker 3:  Hopefully less depressing. Run zombies was too depressing for me. I was like,

1530
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:22,440
Speaker 3:  I don't wanna run anymore.

1531
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:26,160
Speaker 5:  Well if you're not running from zombies, what's the So you were just like,

1532
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,440
Speaker 5:  just let the zombies take me. I don't care anymore.

1533
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,280
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I was like, it's okay. It's, there's what's left in the world. Why

1534
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,640
Speaker 3:  should I jog Jogging's

1535
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:38,000
Speaker 5:  Horrible. Death first. Death first. I actually, I I feel

1536
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,080
Speaker 5:  that. All right. Richard, what's yours? Bunch

1537
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:43,200
Speaker 6:  Of Chrome news this week. Like, like we're at like 15 years of

1538
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:47,120
Speaker 6:  Chrome. So, so really good timing for them to change some things. they said

1539
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,400
Speaker 6:  they're gonna be changing up the look a little bit, so pretty soon as always

1540
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,480
Speaker 6:  with Google, you never really know when things are gonna hit. They're gonna

1541
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:55,960
Speaker 6:  roll out to some people sooner, some people later. But we'll see some new,

1542
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,900
Speaker 5:  They're rounding the corners. Google's rounding all the corners. Now

1543
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,700
Speaker 6:  The corners are, are getting bumped. They're, they're gonna be round rounder.

1544
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:04,720
Speaker 6:  The color palettes will be kind of more like you've seen on

1545
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,680
Speaker 6:  Android. Like if, if you have seen Android in the last couple of years, you've

1546
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:11,300
Speaker 6:  seen what Chrome will look like. Yep. With this material, you,

1547
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:13,840
Speaker 5:  It looks nice. The material use stuff is nice into it. Yeah. I I

1548
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,190
Speaker 6:  I like it. I think it'll be good across different devices. They also have

1549
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:20,060
Speaker 6:  said it's a Privacy Sandbox that's supposed to replace third party cookies

1550
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,520
Speaker 6:  has reached a, a milestone. It is now generally available. You've probably

1551
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,440
Speaker 6:  gotten the popup that says, Hey, we're doing some Privacy stuff. And then

1552
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:29,880
Speaker 6:  you clicked the button to make it go away and didn't think about it. If that

1553
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,200
Speaker 6:  creeps you out. Some people have said that they feel like it's spyware in

1554
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:35,830
Speaker 6:  the browser. Is it more private? Is it more control?

1555
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:39,360
Speaker 6:  Depends on who you ask. But we have some instructions on how to disable it

1556
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,880
Speaker 6:  if you wanna opt out of it. The new targeted ad tracking, Barbara

1557
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,030
Speaker 6:  Krasnoff has the instructions for you to, to go ahead and turn that off.

1558
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:49,840
Speaker 5:  That pop-up made a lot of people feel a lot of feelings and

1559
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,760
Speaker 5:  it's a weird one, right? I'm, I'm genuinely torn on this because like I've

1560
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,640
Speaker 5:  reached a point with all kind of browser data of just total

1561
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:01,560
Speaker 5:  nihilism that it's like I'm in Chrome. Google already knows

1562
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:05,510
Speaker 5:  what I'm doing in Chrome. That's not complicated. And You know who

1563
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:09,280
Speaker 5:  else knows. What I'm doing in my browser is the millions of data

1564
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:13,120
Speaker 5:  brokers who are just collecting and buying and selling data about

1565
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,800
Speaker 5:  everything I do in the browser anyway. And in a lot of ways what Chrome is

1566
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,080
Speaker 5:  doing and what Google is doing with this Privacy Sandbox stuff is designed

1567
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:23,560
Speaker 5:  to combat some of that. And it combats it by saying no one is allowed to

1568
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:27,520
Speaker 5:  have this data except for Google, which is like not great.

1569
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,320
Speaker 5:  That's not the solution you would hope for. But is that better than other

1570
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:34,540
Speaker 5:  solutions? Like instead of everybody and Google? It's just Google. Like Yeah,

1571
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:35,740
Speaker 5:  it kind of is better.

1572
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:37,980
Speaker 3:  It is a solution. Yeah.

1573
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:41,900
Speaker 5:  So I don't know. I'm so torn. But it is very funny watching Google

1574
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,880
Speaker 5:  be like, this is a Privacy preserving thing. And everybody's like, no it's

1575
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,240
Speaker 5:  not. This is just letting you have data that you can give to advertisers.

1576
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:51,040
Speaker 5:  Just like all the other data you have to give to advertisers. Just

1577
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,270
Speaker 3:  Trust them. It's Google. They're not supposed to be evil.
