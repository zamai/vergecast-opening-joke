Description: Back when text messages cost 10 cents each, BlackBerry came up with a better way: BlackBerry Messenger, commonly known as BBM. It was the first new idea about messaging in a long time, and it was a huge hit… for a while. Nilay Patel and Joanna Stern join David Pierce to talk about a messaging service that was years ahead of WhatsApp and iMessage, but ultimately fizzled.

00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:24,005
Speaker 1:  It's 2005. Your phone bill is out of control because

3
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:27,885
Speaker 1:  text messaging is taking off and you're paying 10 cents every single

4
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:31,405
Speaker 1:  time you send or receive a text message. 10 cents. It's

5
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:34,405
Speaker 1:  outrageous. But what if I told you there was a better way? What if there

6
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:38,045
Speaker 1:  was an app on your phone that you could use to send messages to all your

7
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:41,805
Speaker 1:  friends in real time for free and you could even see when they'd read your

8
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:44,765
Speaker 1:  messages? And did I mention it's on your phone? And that's never really happened

9
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:48,405
Speaker 1:  before. It all sounds too good to be true, but it's not. It's called

10
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:52,405
Speaker 1:  BBM or Blackberry Messenger, but everybody calls it BBM. And it's built right

11
00:00:52,435 --> 00:00:56,405
Speaker 1:  into the phone that you either have or you wish that you had from the Virgin

12
00:00:56,625 --> 00:01:00,525
Speaker 1:  Vox Media. This is version history, a show about the best and

13
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:04,445
Speaker 1:  worst and weirdest and most important gadgets and products in the history

14
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:08,245
Speaker 1:  of technology. I'm David Pierce, and today we have to talk about texting.

15
00:01:08,755 --> 00:01:09,245
Speaker 1:  Stay tuned.

16
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:52,805
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. It's version history. It's time to talk. BBM

17
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:55,365
Speaker 1:  my friends are here. Joanna Stern is here. Hi Joanna.

18
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:58,285
Speaker 6:  I'd like you to refer to me by my Blackberry pin number for

19
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,685
Speaker 1:  The, do you still know it? This is what I was gonna ask you. This is my first

20
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:01,005
Speaker 1:  question.

21
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:03,685
Speaker 6:  3 5 0 9 8 5 4.

22
00:02:05,115 --> 00:02:06,655
Speaker 1:  The good thing is you could just make that up. I'll

23
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:06,975
Speaker 6:  I Yeah,

24
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:10,615
Speaker 1:  That's fine. Neil Absel is also here. Eli, do you remember your BBM pin?

25
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:14,215
Speaker 1:  No. My role on this episode is to be the person who grew up in the Midwest

26
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:17,895
Speaker 1:  away from these fancy east coasters and their Verizon network and blackberries

27
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:21,775
Speaker 1:  and provide the view of the common man. So, okay, this, this is another thing

28
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:25,295
Speaker 1:  I wonder, do you guys remember the story here Starts in 2005.

29
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:30,245
Speaker 1:  Did you have a Blackberry in 2005? No, I did not. Do you, what phone did

30
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:33,885
Speaker 1:  you have in 2005 do you think? I had almost certainly a Sony Erickson.

31
00:02:34,115 --> 00:02:37,925
Speaker 1:  Okay. Yeah, that was, this was, that was a Sony Erickson person. I like that

32
00:02:37,995 --> 00:02:41,405
Speaker 1:  this was like the end, if memory serves of like the razor

33
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:45,845
Speaker 1:  was still the thing, but not for much longer. The LG chocolate

34
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:50,085
Speaker 1:  was huge in 2005. If I'm doing my time correctly here, it's a little bit

35
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:52,445
Speaker 1:  later. Was it a little later? A little later. Okay. Do you remember what

36
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:53,005
Speaker 1:  you had? I

37
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:56,085
Speaker 6:  Did. I had an LG flip phone. Nice. Yeah, a Verizon.

38
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:58,845
Speaker 1:  This was that era when the goal

39
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,605
Speaker 7:  Was to make the phone as small as possible, right?

40
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:02,805
Speaker 6:  Flip phones. Yeah. Yeah.

41
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:06,205
Speaker 7:  And they were like, that was like the Zoolander phone. And then the other

42
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:10,445
Speaker 7:  move was the Blackberry. And everyone I knew on the East coast had a Blackberry

43
00:03:10,945 --> 00:03:13,885
Speaker 7:  and everyone in the Midwest had like an LG chocolate that was free with the

44
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:14,125
Speaker 7:  plan.

45
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:18,525
Speaker 6:  But to your point, I was in college and the fancy kids did have

46
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:20,565
Speaker 6:  BlackBerrys. Yep. I was not fancy.

47
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:22,305
Speaker 1:  Not yet Now.

48
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:25,545
Speaker 7:  Soon. It was coming for you soon. Joanna Stern would take her full bloom.

49
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:26,025
Speaker 7:  It

50
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:29,385
Speaker 6:  Was, it was fancy though at that point to have a color screen,

51
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:30,375
Speaker 6:  like

52
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:31,175
Speaker 1:  A Oh, interesting.

53
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:34,895
Speaker 6:  Like a color LCD either on the outside of the phone or the inside of the

54
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:35,015
Speaker 6:  phone.

55
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:39,415
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I was, I was like, I had a, one of the like T nine candy

56
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:43,455
Speaker 1:  bar phones that again I got for free with my Verizon plan. My

57
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:47,415
Speaker 1:  family, we all got a family plan together in 2004 and it

58
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:51,055
Speaker 1:  was like a momentous occasion in my family and we all got the worst phone

59
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:54,335
Speaker 1:  they had available because it was free with the plan. Yeah,

60
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:57,295
Speaker 7:  It's good stuff. You get a lot of analog razors for free right before the

61
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:58,495
Speaker 7:  networks went digital and got better.

62
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:02,615
Speaker 1:  But Joanna, you are here because at some point between not having a

63
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:06,335
Speaker 1:  Blackberry in 2005 and way after everyone

64
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:09,975
Speaker 1:  stopped using PBM, you became like the world's foremost BBM user.

65
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:11,535
Speaker 1:  Is that Yes.

66
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:15,575
Speaker 6:  Fair. In fact, I know Neli never had BBM 'cause I

67
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:16,655
Speaker 6:  could never message him there.

68
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:20,335
Speaker 1:  I do remember you being like belligerent that everyone should be using

69
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:24,135
Speaker 6:  PBM. Yes. And when we started The Verge, it was even before then when we

70
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:28,105
Speaker 6:  were at Eng Gadget, a few people had BBMI can still

71
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:28,545
Speaker 6:  remember them.

72
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:32,985
Speaker 7:  And again, I'm just gonna point out this split was fancy East Coasters and

73
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:33,865
Speaker 7:  everyone else it

74
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:34,905
Speaker 6:  Was, it re it really

75
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:38,225
Speaker 7:  Was. It absolutely was. We, we ran Eng Gadget on AOL Instant Messenger, which

76
00:04:38,225 --> 00:04:39,585
Speaker 7:  is a different episode of the show.

77
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:41,505
Speaker 6:  Oh, can I be invited back for that?

78
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:45,025
Speaker 1:  Oh yeah, that's, that may be the longest version history episode we ever

79
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:48,965
Speaker 6:  Do. Well we really ran it on ICQ. Yep. But we

80
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:52,045
Speaker 6:  must have just texted just text like I was not at my

81
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:56,125
Speaker 6:  huge laptop at the time. I must have just texted you. Yeah, that's right.

82
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:57,325
Speaker 6:  And then when you came into the picture

83
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,405
Speaker 1:  For 10 cents a message

84
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:01,365
Speaker 6:  When you were a little baby. I know that's true. And you came into the picture,

85
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:05,525
Speaker 1:  I think I had a, I think I showed up with a Trio six 50. Yeah. Which I was

86
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:07,725
Speaker 1:  very happy about that.

87
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah. A close out Trio six 50.

88
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:15,125
Speaker 1:  Yeah. All right. So let me just tell you the story of PBM

89
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:18,965
Speaker 1:  as I know it. You both lived it more than I did. You with a clear

90
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:20,405
Speaker 1:  sense of jealousy and sadness.

91
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:24,445
Speaker 7:  I was there for the ever man. I was like, I don't understand these phones

92
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:26,245
Speaker 7:  at all. Like here we go. So,

93
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:29,925
Speaker 1:  Okay. So the story here starts in early 2005

94
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:34,845
Speaker 1:  and the thing I learned is actually 2005 was the year instant messaging

95
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:38,725
Speaker 1:  as a whole became like a mainstream thing. There

96
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:42,365
Speaker 1:  was a study that year that found that it was instant messaging was as big

97
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:46,005
Speaker 1:  as email for the first time ever in 2005, which is actually later

98
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:49,645
Speaker 1:  than I would've guessed. And also like all the youngs

99
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:53,725
Speaker 1:  were IMing. That was like the big takeaway is like all the young people are

100
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:56,885
Speaker 1:  IMing and this is not like texting, this is IMing. They were like sitting

101
00:05:56,885 --> 00:06:00,565
Speaker 1:  at the family computer on a OL into Messenger, which I did

102
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:03,265
Speaker 1:  all through high school. Yeah. That was my entire life. And

103
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:06,305
Speaker 6:  I was in again in college. 'cause you were a little baby, correct? Yeah.

104
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:09,585
Speaker 6:  You were still drinking bottle and eating. That's right. Yeah.

105
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:13,905
Speaker 6:  Instant me, like instant messenger defined college

106
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:17,745
Speaker 6:  at the that point. 'cause we couldn't communicate if we had left our computers.

107
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:22,065
Speaker 6:  Like you could do T nine texting on your little crappy phone. Yeah.

108
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:26,185
Speaker 6:  Eli, the every man was even T nine texting in Minnesota or wherever you

109
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:26,865
Speaker 6:  were from. It was so,

110
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:31,465
Speaker 7:  So disrespectful. It was Wisconsin. I knew that. And

111
00:06:31,465 --> 00:06:34,745
Speaker 7:  every, every commercial for texting

112
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:39,145
Speaker 7:  was like teens and they would all be sending some variation on the same

113
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:42,905
Speaker 7:  message, which was meet me at the spot. And it was just like,

114
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:45,945
Speaker 7:  it became, it was a running joke with my friends that we would only text

115
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:49,865
Speaker 7:  each other meet me at the spot because that was every single commercial

116
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:54,185
Speaker 7:  was like happy teens in a Jeep Wrangler being like, man hit the spot. And

117
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:55,545
Speaker 7:  like, this is all you ever text. I

118
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:59,145
Speaker 1:  Feel like it was usually surfing at the spot. Right? They like mostly surfed

119
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:00,345
Speaker 1:  at whenever, wherever the spot

120
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:03,065
Speaker 7:  Was. But 'cause you, because you, it was too expensive a whole conversation

121
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:03,585
Speaker 7:  just on like

122
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:04,345
Speaker 6:  Messaging

123
00:07:04,345 --> 00:07:07,865
Speaker 7:  Phones. Right? You just did these like logistical conversations on text

124
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:12,345
Speaker 6:  And part of those like ads were, they were a bucket of text

125
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:16,105
Speaker 6:  messages that your family could get back to your family plan or you had to

126
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:17,225
Speaker 6:  kind of pay per text.

127
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:20,825
Speaker 1:  Right? Right. So that, that's the, the two things I feel like are really

128
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:24,505
Speaker 1:  important to remember about this period is like WeChat didn't exist.

129
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:28,385
Speaker 1:  WhatsApp didn't exist. Facebook hadn't done anything. Google Talk launched

130
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:31,545
Speaker 1:  in 2005, which thought was interesting, but it wasn't built into Gmail yet

131
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:35,065
Speaker 1:  and nobody was really using it. But it was like all this stuff was like starting

132
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:38,985
Speaker 1:  to happen. Yeah. But it was still you. You sent meet me at the

133
00:07:38,985 --> 00:07:42,225
Speaker 1:  spot text messages and so I did And you did all of your actual conversation

134
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:42,865
Speaker 1:  stuff at

135
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:43,705
Speaker 7:  The spot. At

136
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:44,025
Speaker 6:  The spot.

137
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:48,865
Speaker 7:  You were like everything was about when and how or are we gonna get

138
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:49,625
Speaker 7:  to the spot? Right.

139
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:52,385
Speaker 6:  Or you would run back to the spot that was your desktop computer.

140
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:55,425
Speaker 7:  Yeah. To then once again say I'm going to the spot. Need the spot. Right.

141
00:07:56,205 --> 00:08:00,105
Speaker 7:  What's really fascinating about this at that time is even back then,

142
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:04,505
Speaker 7:  everyone knew messaging platforms were so sticky that they could create like

143
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:07,905
Speaker 7:  powerful locked in competitors. So

144
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:13,385
Speaker 7:  during one of time Warner's many attempts to buy something, they

145
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:17,105
Speaker 7:  bought a OL, you might recall a doomed merger that was eventually

146
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:20,925
Speaker 7:  undone the Time Warner story. And during that

147
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:24,685
Speaker 7:  merger the government said, we're gonna let you buy a OL. But a OL and some

148
00:08:24,685 --> 00:08:28,525
Speaker 7:  messenger is so powerful and so sticky that a condition of the merger

149
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,725
Speaker 7:  is you have to make it interoperable with other in instant messaging platforms.

150
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:35,845
Speaker 7:  Because E even back then, everyone knew this is lock-in. You can't get

151
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:38,045
Speaker 7:  all your friends to leave one platform and join another.

152
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:42,285
Speaker 6:  And in fact, I'm remembering some of those messaging phones did

153
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:45,485
Speaker 6:  at some point, I don't wanna say it was 2005, but maybe a little bit later,

154
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:49,165
Speaker 6:  like two years later had Aim Yep. Had

155
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:53,045
Speaker 6:  instant Messenger and maybe Google Talk. But it was the crappiest

156
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:56,805
Speaker 6:  experience. Yes. Because it was like some, I don't, what were they WAP apps?

157
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:59,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah. They were all really bad. They ran in, they ran in like fake internet.

158
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:01,165
Speaker 7:  Right. You had to pay extra for fake internet

159
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:04,805
Speaker 6:  And you had gotten an error. It'd be like, you gotta pay at and t $700 to

160
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:08,685
Speaker 6:  get to this app. And so there was like, again, I just keep

161
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:12,405
Speaker 6:  highlighting this. There was the laptop computer world of

162
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:15,045
Speaker 6:  messaging and there was the mobile world of messaging.

163
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:17,685
Speaker 1:  Totally. And the, and the, the thing about the 10 cents thing is it like,

164
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:21,565
Speaker 1:  it was a absolute like money fountain for carriers

165
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:25,165
Speaker 1:  if I remember right. It was like the, the story is, it was basically like

166
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,405
Speaker 1:  a rounding error of bandwidth that they figured out how to put messaging

167
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:30,525
Speaker 1:  and that's why it's 160 characters and they just like 110 cents message.

168
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:31,005
Speaker 1:  Was

169
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,205
Speaker 7:  It 140? I

170
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,885
Speaker 1:  Think so. No, that was Twitter and they made it 140 so that you could also

171
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:37,685
Speaker 1:  put in the username and get to 160 character text message. Come on

172
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:39,125
Speaker 1:  school.

173
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:43,565
Speaker 7:  I said that as an avatar for the audience. But they, they which is also wondering,

174
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:46,085
Speaker 1:  They were making a ton of money off of this. Lemme just play this for you.

175
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:46,325
Speaker 1:  I

176
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:47,205
Speaker 7:  Hope they say meet me at the spot.

177
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:51,205
Speaker 8:  Be wau. Your cell phone bill is what's up?

178
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:55,285
Speaker 8:  All this texting O-M-G-I-N-B-D. It is a big deal. Who

179
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:58,765
Speaker 8:  are you texting 50 times a day? I'd Okay. My BFF Jill

180
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:02,045
Speaker 8:  tell your B fff Jill that I'm taking away your phone.

181
00:10:02,265 --> 00:10:05,085
Speaker 6:  That's exactly what I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah. Right. They were like

182
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:08,805
Speaker 6:  family messaging and it gonna, it's gonna cost you a fortune.

183
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:13,165
Speaker 1:  But so the the fascinating, like the right before BBM thing

184
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:15,805
Speaker 1:  that happened that I thought was super interesting and had completely forgotten

185
00:10:15,805 --> 00:10:19,405
Speaker 1:  about is that Blackberry launched a new

186
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:22,525
Speaker 1:  app that was gonna integrate all this stuff. All the stuff that you're talking

187
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:25,645
Speaker 1:  about. Blackberry was like, we're gonna put, I think it was Yahoo Messenger,

188
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,925
Speaker 1:  AIM and ICQ. They were like, we're gonna do

189
00:10:30,135 --> 00:10:32,845
Speaker 1:  IMing on your phone. Yeah. And it's, it's gonna be cool and it's gonna work.

190
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:36,725
Speaker 1:  And it was like a little wonky because doing that stuff on mobile is a little

191
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:40,525
Speaker 1:  bit harder because you have like the, the buddy system or the buddy list

192
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,885
Speaker 1:  stuff is fine. But then there's like the status stuff that's a little weirder

193
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:45,445
Speaker 1:  on phones. But they were gonna do it. Like they understood that internet

194
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,165
Speaker 1:  messaging to your point is gonna be the thing.

195
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:52,245
Speaker 7:  I think they also had a sense that people on Blackberries were essentially

196
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:55,925
Speaker 7:  emailing in real time. Yeah. 'cause the way the Blackberry network was

197
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:59,365
Speaker 7:  architected, and this is like the plot of the movie, which we both love.

198
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:04,005
Speaker 7:  Like that was Blackberry was they re-architected how to sell

199
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:07,525
Speaker 7:  networks worked and they had big Blackberry enterprise servers

200
00:11:07,985 --> 00:11:11,565
Speaker 7:  all over the place be Yeah. That were actually doing the work.

201
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:16,485
Speaker 7:  Like your iPhone SB Yes. Blackberry Enterprise server. And that's like your

202
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:19,125
Speaker 7:  business would have one, but then Blackberry ran one for the big networks.

203
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,365
Speaker 7:  Yep. And the actual handsets were doing almost nothing on the network.

204
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:26,485
Speaker 7:  It was the servers that were handling all of the traffic and all the processing.

205
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,445
Speaker 7:  'cause the phones were bandwidth constrained, battery constrained, all that

206
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:29,645
Speaker 7:  stuff.

207
00:11:30,185 --> 00:11:33,645
Speaker 1:  And that was as much the thing Blackberry did or that was their in motion

208
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:36,525
Speaker 1:  did then correctly that no one else was doing. Was they like made that stuff

209
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:36,765
Speaker 1:  work.

210
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:39,845
Speaker 7:  Yeah. They centralized the hard part 'cause the network was crappy. Right.

211
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:42,805
Speaker 7:  And so they're like, okay, people are emailing in real time. We can just

212
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:46,885
Speaker 7:  extend that model to a oh one sent Messenger or Yahoo. Yahoo Messenger

213
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:50,405
Speaker 7:  and we'll bite off another little bit of the internet and make that on the

214
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:50,565
Speaker 7:  phone.

215
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:51,805
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And

216
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:55,425
Speaker 7:  That was a very linear progression from what they were doing with email.

217
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:59,265
Speaker 7:  Obviously this was not the right idea, but it was, you can see how they got

218
00:11:59,265 --> 00:11:59,745
Speaker 7:  to it very

219
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:03,505
Speaker 1:  Quickly. Yeah. Well and so the, it it, it did sort of happen that

220
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:07,545
Speaker 1:  quickly as it seems it wasn't, there wasn't some like Grand Proclamation

221
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:11,145
Speaker 1:  about like, we need to embrace internet messaging. It was just like somebody

222
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:14,425
Speaker 1:  just like made the thing send text messages. And I have a whole story about

223
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:16,625
Speaker 1:  this, but there's also a clip from the Blackberry movie that you're talking

224
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:20,065
Speaker 1:  about that literally just explains the whole thing. This is, if I remember

225
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:23,265
Speaker 1:  correctly, it's like halfway into the movie and Jim Balsley, who's played

226
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:26,545
Speaker 1:  by Glenn Howerton, my boy Dennis Reynolds from It's always Sunny in Philadelphia,

227
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:30,785
Speaker 1:  shows up and his team pitches him on a messaging

228
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:32,505
Speaker 1:  app they've just created. Let's just play the clip.

229
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:35,265
Speaker 9:  Do you know how much it costs to send a text message? Yeah.

230
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:39,785
Speaker 9:  10 cents and the network gets every penny. We're never gonna see that money.

231
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:40,305
Speaker 9:  Right.

232
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,905
Speaker 10:  But these texts are sent via data

233
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:48,185
Speaker 10:  so behind the network's back, which means

234
00:12:48,655 --> 00:12:51,825
Speaker 9:  Unlimited free texting only on Blackberry.

235
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:57,025
Speaker 9:  Fuck yes.

236
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:00,185
Speaker 7:  Yeah, that's exactly what

237
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:01,145
Speaker 6:  Happened. Yeah. It went down like

238
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,425
Speaker 1:  That. That's basically right. Dennis, from what I understand it from Always

239
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:06,905
Speaker 1:  Sunny was there and it was great. But like

240
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:09,465
Speaker 1:  IIII think you're right that it essentially was that simple. They were like,

241
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:12,975
Speaker 1:  oh well we can do this thing with email, we can just do it with text messaging.

242
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:16,735
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I, to be honest, don't really like

243
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:20,815
Speaker 1:  remember the moment it came out, but from what I've read, it was like

244
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:24,375
Speaker 1:  a pheno, like the idea of you can send text messages to people and not pay

245
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:28,245
Speaker 1:  10 cents per text message was like immediately a big

246
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:29,765
Speaker 1:  deal. Do you guys remember this moment at all?

247
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:34,515
Speaker 6:  I was a little late to it. Okay. But I do remember that being

248
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:37,195
Speaker 6:  one of the reasons I wanted a Blackberry

249
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,315
Speaker 7:  Because your friends were on it and they

250
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:42,355
Speaker 6:  Had, 'cause my friends were on it and I knew I could be BM with them. Yeah.

251
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:46,755
Speaker 6:  And I had friends that had it and had talked about BBM to me. So

252
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:49,475
Speaker 6:  it was, as he said, this was the selling point. Yeah.

253
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:53,435
Speaker 1:  It took off. So the, the app itself was created by

254
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:56,075
Speaker 1:  a bunch of people, but particularly this guy named Gary Klassen. Shout out

255
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:59,995
Speaker 1:  to Gary. He works at Google now. Which feels, of course the app I

256
00:13:59,995 --> 00:14:03,555
Speaker 1:  learned very recently was originally called Quick Messenger. It was like

257
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:06,955
Speaker 1:  this close to being called Quick Messenger, all one word. And then

258
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:11,355
Speaker 1:  somebody called it BBM before they really called it Blackberry

259
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:13,955
Speaker 1:  Messenger. They were calling it BBM, which I found sort of fascinating. It's

260
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:17,915
Speaker 1:  like BBM is like almost a acronym out of just, we just

261
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:21,795
Speaker 1:  wanna call it the thing BBM. And it had this thing called

262
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:25,195
Speaker 1:  pin to pin messaging, which is where the, the PIN stuff was really important

263
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:28,955
Speaker 1:  because one of the things that let you do was read receipts,

264
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:31,955
Speaker 1:  which nothing had ever had before. But you could see if somebody had looked

265
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,155
Speaker 1:  at your message just because of the way that it was able to connect over

266
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:38,435
Speaker 1:  the, the Black Brain Network. And I have this quote from Gary K and that

267
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:42,075
Speaker 1:  I thought was really interesting. He said this in 2015 on the the 10 year

268
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:45,235
Speaker 1:  anniversary. He said BBM was the first form of text communication that was

269
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:48,315
Speaker 1:  instant cross carrier and mobile in a time when people were still attached

270
00:14:48,315 --> 00:14:49,035
Speaker 1:  to their PCs.

271
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:52,725
Speaker 6:  Can we go back to the name for a second? Because when I was preparing for

272
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,715
Speaker 6:  this, I was, why wasn't it called bm? For obvious

273
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,155
Speaker 6:  reasons. I was gonna say you, they didn't call it that.

274
00:14:58,215 --> 00:14:59,675
Speaker 1:  You got there very quickly. Right. Yeah,

275
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:03,675
Speaker 6:  I got there very quickly. But like, I'm not sure, and I wonder

276
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:07,035
Speaker 6:  about listeners who are listening to this in this day and age, if they even

277
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:10,315
Speaker 6:  know that this related to Blackberry, like BBM

278
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:14,635
Speaker 6:  became this like thing that you needed to have a blackberry for

279
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:17,315
Speaker 6:  but the name wasn't in it. Like Blackberry Messenger was not what people

280
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:19,835
Speaker 6:  ended up saying. So it's, it ended up just Blackberry.

281
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:23,195
Speaker 1:  It was part of the platform. It's like MTV or the SATs. It's like it ultimately

282
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:24,595
Speaker 1:  doesn't stand for anything anymore. It's just

283
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:26,755
Speaker 6:  The name and it didn't like mean anything. Yeah. Like the branding wasn't

284
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:27,715
Speaker 6:  there for them. Right.

285
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:30,715
Speaker 1:  Yeah. 'cause even we're, we're gonna get to this, but like many years later,

286
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,875
Speaker 1:  BBM showed up on lots of other stuff and nobody ever called it, it wasn't

287
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,395
Speaker 1:  like Blackberry Messenger for iPhone, it was just BBM. Right. I was like

288
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,355
Speaker 1:  what does BBM stand for? Like, I don't know, like what does s ESPN stand

289
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:40,915
Speaker 1:  for? Like no one,

290
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:44,075
Speaker 6:  They should have called it BM and would've gone down better. Yeah.

291
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:45,195
Speaker 7:  They would've at least gotten more coverage. Just

292
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:48,915
Speaker 1:  BM me later. Yeah, Fine. I think that's,

293
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,835
Speaker 1:  I'm gonna, I'm gonna get HR calls by that back to serious conversation. So

294
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:55,795
Speaker 1:  anyway, so the app ends up launching August 1st, 2005. This all happens very

295
00:15:55,795 --> 00:15:59,715
Speaker 1:  fast was what I learned. They like basically decided to do this

296
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:02,915
Speaker 1:  thing and shipped it in just a few months. And lemme just read you a list

297
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:06,755
Speaker 1:  of some of the things that it had, like in version one it

298
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:10,435
Speaker 1:  had group chat, it had online offline status you could send files,

299
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:14,115
Speaker 1:  it had read receipts, it had the mutual authentication, the like buddy list

300
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:17,675
Speaker 1:  stuff that it borrowed from Im and basically every other just sort of

301
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:21,435
Speaker 1:  straightforward messaging. Like it was a full on I am client

302
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,155
Speaker 1:  for mobile like from day one. But

303
00:16:24,295 --> 00:16:27,235
Speaker 7:  I'm just saying nuts. They just were like, oh people are emailing in real

304
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:30,875
Speaker 7:  time now that now it's called BM. And so they just

305
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,755
Speaker 7:  inherited a bunch of like file transfers from their

306
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:38,275
Speaker 7:  existing email service. And then they added the buddy list and the pin and

307
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:39,355
Speaker 7:  on the reader receipts, right? It's

308
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:43,315
Speaker 1:  Like if you just smash Blackberry Enterprise Server into

309
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:47,355
Speaker 1:  aim, you get BBM in like a very straightforward way, which is kind of wild.

310
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:51,555
Speaker 6:  And going back to this idea of like what we used to do at our computers,

311
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:55,235
Speaker 6:  like I think this was fundamental to Blackberry and also fundamental to their

312
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:58,675
Speaker 6:  fall is they really just were like, what are people doing at their

313
00:16:58,955 --> 00:17:01,915
Speaker 6:  computers and do they wanna do on the go? Because they were kind of the like

314
00:17:01,975 --> 00:17:05,395
Speaker 6:  get shit done company. Right? We, we are gonna let you do your work on the

315
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:08,595
Speaker 6:  go. Ensure that ended up translating really well to consumers

316
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:13,115
Speaker 6:  and they saw, as you said at the beginning of this, that more people at this

317
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,435
Speaker 6:  time were starting to do instant messenger on their computers. And so they

318
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:20,355
Speaker 6:  were like, great. Put another thing into the, to the phone, which

319
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:24,035
Speaker 6:  obviously was the problem for them. They kept trying to shove things into

320
00:17:24,115 --> 00:17:27,515
Speaker 6:  a phone without thinking about like taking like sort of the desktop model

321
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:30,595
Speaker 6:  and the computer model and just shoving it into mobile. Which,

322
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:32,785
Speaker 6:  you know, what happened.

323
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:33,905
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

324
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:36,665
Speaker 7:  It's like Joanna was like, I got my first Blackberry in 2007. It's like,

325
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:38,385
Speaker 7:  do you know what else happened in 2007?

326
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:42,625
Speaker 6:  I wanna say it was the end of 2006. 'cause I'm all right thinking like I

327
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:46,585
Speaker 6:  graduated college in 2006 and got my first like phone. Like I was

328
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:48,025
Speaker 6:  like, I'm ready for the world. Right.

329
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,925
Speaker 1:  Blackberry? I definitely got my first Blackberry after the iPhone launched.

330
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:52,045
Speaker 1:  Now that I'm think about,

331
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:55,005
Speaker 7:  I wanna point out that David is also a fancy pan East coaster. Yeah, he is.

332
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:58,685
Speaker 7:  Oh sure. He was like, I, I grew up and I was in Connecticut and then I was

333
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:00,165
Speaker 7:  issued a Blackberry by the state

334
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:02,525
Speaker 6:  By my family. Yeah,

335
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,925
Speaker 1:  You're you're closer than you think.

336
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:05,525
Speaker 6:  David's family had a bad server.

337
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:09,565
Speaker 1:  I got it. I got it from the dad of a kid that I babysat. There you go. Go.

338
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:11,565
Speaker 1:  'cause he got a free one from work. That's a real thing that happened.

339
00:18:11,835 --> 00:18:14,965
Speaker 7:  It's like if you entered Greenwich, Connecticut. Yes. In 2006 you were handed

340
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:15,405
Speaker 7:  a Blackberry.

341
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:18,125
Speaker 1:  Oh a hundred percent. It really, really was. You could tell who worked in

342
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,965
Speaker 1:  finance because, and I have these distinct memories of getting on the train

343
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:24,885
Speaker 1:  from Greenwich to New York and all like it felt like all

344
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:28,125
Speaker 1:  of a sudden one day everybody had a Blackberry. Yeah. And it was like, 'cause

345
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,125
Speaker 1:  that was the whole pitch, right? It's like you can do your emails while you're

346
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,565
Speaker 1:  on the train on the way to work. And that was like life-changing

347
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:33,045
Speaker 6:  From people and now

348
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,685
Speaker 1:  Instant message and me, I'm just sitting there like putting stuff in my calendar

349
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,045
Speaker 1:  as like senior in high school.

350
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,525
Speaker 7:  Oh there was nothing funnier when than when all the high schoolers s like

351
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:44,525
Speaker 7:  pom pilots and we're like, what's on your calendar? It's like nothing

352
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:48,165
Speaker 1:  To-do. List social studies. Like Yeah. Who is this for?

353
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:52,805
Speaker 1:  But yeah, so, okay. And you said this while we were watching the clip, but

354
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:55,325
Speaker 1:  one of their big things was this pin to pin technology was supposed to be

355
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:57,845
Speaker 1:  super secure. Turns out not so much.

356
00:18:58,435 --> 00:19:02,125
Speaker 7:  Well, well it was just the, the target of the Blackberry

357
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:06,045
Speaker 7:  server was irresistible to governments around the world. So one

358
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:09,725
Speaker 7:  of the stories we were just endlessly covering in Eng Gadget would be India

359
00:19:09,825 --> 00:19:13,005
Speaker 7:  has decided Blackberry needs to break encryption. Mm. And then they could

360
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:16,885
Speaker 7:  just turn off the Blackberry network 'cause they could just find the

361
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:20,365
Speaker 7:  BES and unplug it until Blackberry caved. And there was just this huge

362
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:24,685
Speaker 7:  back and forth fight in a way that, you know, now end-to-end encryption on

363
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:28,445
Speaker 7:  phones. It's, it's much harder to just go to Jim Balsley and be like,

364
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:32,365
Speaker 7:  fix it or I'm taking your business away. Right? Right. And at that time

365
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:35,285
Speaker 7:  there was just so much pressure on this company and eventually they'd, I

366
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:38,085
Speaker 7:  think they caved in a couple of countries around the world and that that,

367
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:42,405
Speaker 7:  that I think really that's when that you knew they no longer had

368
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:46,165
Speaker 7:  the power they once had. Hmm. Right. When the pressure on them was so

369
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:48,845
Speaker 7:  great and they couldn't just resist it 'cause they were Blackberry in the

370
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:51,605
Speaker 7:  way that, for example, apple and Google can just resist it because they're

371
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:54,645
Speaker 7:  Apple and Google. But yeah, eventually some of this stuff started breaking

372
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:54,845
Speaker 7:  down.

373
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:58,965
Speaker 1:  I also feel like it's just a thing you can unplug. It turned out to be a

374
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,245
Speaker 1:  bad security practice. Yeah.

375
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:04,645
Speaker 7:  In general. Like he, all the information is on that computer. I just give

376
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:07,085
Speaker 7:  me that computer is like a real thing cops can

377
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:10,685
Speaker 1:  Say. Right? Yeah, that's very true. All right, so BBM comes out big hit

378
00:20:10,685 --> 00:20:12,845
Speaker 1:  immediately it takes off. It was really funny going back and reading a bunch

379
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:16,565
Speaker 1:  of stuff from like those first years. Nobody could really explain

380
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:20,565
Speaker 1:  like why they liked BBM so much except that it was cheaper and it

381
00:20:20,565 --> 00:20:23,405
Speaker 1:  was really fast. That was the thing I'd forgotten about BBM, this thing where

382
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:27,285
Speaker 1:  you could like in literally instantly real time message each

383
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:31,205
Speaker 1:  other. I also forgotten how unreliable SMS was back in the day.

384
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:35,165
Speaker 1:  That like messages would just get lost, things would happen. You never

385
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:38,845
Speaker 1:  really, and BBM was like, it was a reliable fast way to get in touch with

386
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:42,445
Speaker 1:  people. And that was a bigger deal to folks even in that era than I had

387
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:43,685
Speaker 1:  remembered. Which is nuts.

388
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:47,420
Speaker 6:  And you didn't have, you didn't, you talked about the 160 character, you

389
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,965
Speaker 6:  didn't have that. Right? So it wasn't like splitting messages. Like when

390
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:54,085
Speaker 6:  we would text at that, you would get like an error, like can't send it anymore.

391
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:57,445
Speaker 6:  And you'd have to send that and then continue your message. Yeah. So that

392
00:20:57,445 --> 00:21:01,245
Speaker 6:  it was just, again, all of those things that you had gotten used to messaging

393
00:21:01,245 --> 00:21:04,885
Speaker 6:  at your computer and I can't remember like when did a, did aim have

394
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:09,005
Speaker 6:  receipts anyway, that was another huge thing about like you knew

395
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:12,125
Speaker 6:  somebody had gotten that message right? It had reli, it had gone through,

396
00:21:12,465 --> 00:21:15,765
Speaker 6:  it was reliably delivered and they were not responding to you. Okay, wait,

397
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:18,205
Speaker 1:  Here's a fun question. Do you remember the letters? There were two letters

398
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,845
Speaker 1:  that it used to show you different status in in the read receipts. Do you

399
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:22,365
Speaker 1:  remember what they were?

400
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:24,065
Speaker 6:  DNR.

401
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:28,145
Speaker 1:  You're right. It was D for delivered and R for red. But at first,

402
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:32,065
Speaker 1:  a fun fact that I learned was that at the very beginning, instead of the

403
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:35,905
Speaker 1:  R, it was actually an A because a designer had read the thing wrong

404
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:39,305
Speaker 1:  and coded in an A instead of R. That's so for red it just showed up an A.

405
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:39,745
Speaker 1:  That's

406
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:40,625
Speaker 7:  Perfect. That's great

407
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:42,105
Speaker 1:  Blackberry access.

408
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:47,425
Speaker 1:  But anyway, so we're fast forward through time here. BB m blows up.

409
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:51,945
Speaker 1:  BBM five comes out. Big deal. Very exciting. This was like peak

410
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:55,825
Speaker 1:  blackberry. It ended up getting like every feature you could

411
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:59,665
Speaker 1:  possibly imagine, which I'd forgotten. You could send money you could post

412
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,945
Speaker 1:  to. I didn't know that. Yeah, there was a, there was a money sending thing

413
00:22:02,945 --> 00:22:04,225
Speaker 1:  eventually. This

414
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:04,945
Speaker 7:  The world's for

415
00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:08,505
Speaker 1:  Super app. This came Really? Yeah, like this all, some of they came later,

416
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:13,345
Speaker 1:  but then you could eventually post a Facebook and Twitter. It had a, there

417
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:16,385
Speaker 1:  was BM music. Do you guys remember BM music? I don't know that I'm going

418
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:20,025
Speaker 1:  to do a good job of explaining. So lemme just play a clip from TechRadar

419
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,145
Speaker 1:  from I think 2011 where they actually got a hands-on with the thing

420
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:27,025
Speaker 11:  For a monthly fee of $4 99, which is around three pounds.

421
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:31,025
Speaker 11:  Blackberry users will have unlimited access to 50 personally selected songs.

422
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:35,145
Speaker 11:  And then once every four weeks you'll be able to change 25 on your

423
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:39,025
Speaker 11:  list. Now this doesn't sound like a great deal on its

424
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:42,785
Speaker 11:  own. It doesn't. What will pull in uses is the ability to access all 50

425
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,385
Speaker 11:  songs on each of your BB Empire.

426
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:46,105
Speaker 7:  Why are you trying to make it sound good?

427
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,625
Speaker 11:  But beware to choose your music carefully. The idea is that you create a

428
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:54,105
Speaker 11:  personal music profile with your chosen songs that other people can browse

429
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:55,785
Speaker 11:  through. So you might want to think

430
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:56,785
Speaker 7:  This is just hell

431
00:22:57,135 --> 00:23:00,545
Speaker 6:  Look at this pan or no, it's not a pan. She's pushing the phone into the

432
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,305
Speaker 6:  shot. She's holding

433
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:02,945
Speaker 7:  The phones. Yeah. So thank

434
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:03,265
Speaker 1:  You Tech

435
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:03,705
Speaker 6:  Radar that

436
00:23:03,705 --> 00:23:07,025
Speaker 7:  Don't off the camera. Yeah. That's an old tech radar video. Yeah. And I just

437
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:10,665
Speaker 7:  have to say that you can tell there is like a PR person standing over the

438
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:13,545
Speaker 7:  shoulder 'cause they had to make it sound somewhat reasonable. All of that

439
00:23:13,645 --> 00:23:14,865
Speaker 7:  is hell on earth.

440
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:16,505
Speaker 6:  That's not an ad. No,

441
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:20,305
Speaker 1:  That's a decorat. Put her hands on was a review. Yeah. Oh you, it's, it's

442
00:23:20,305 --> 00:23:22,985
Speaker 1:  completely true. She was definitely like at a launch event holding the phone

443
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,545
Speaker 1:  and there are three comms people standing behind. Yes. And we've all been

444
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:26,025
Speaker 1:  through this. This is

445
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:28,625
Speaker 7:  Awful. Yes. And eventually you become a sociopath and you're like, I don't

446
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,305
Speaker 7:  care what you think. Yeah. But early on you're like, yeah, I think they'll

447
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:34,305
Speaker 7:  sell it to some people who will think this is a good idea. And the camera

448
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:38,425
Speaker 6:  Guy or camera woman could not move. And so she had to pan the phone up

449
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:39,025
Speaker 6:  into the,

450
00:23:40,145 --> 00:23:43,545
Speaker 7:  I just know I've made that video. I have a lot of sympathy for how that video

451
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:46,845
Speaker 7:  is produced. And you're just like, this is the stupidest idea in the world.

452
00:23:47,035 --> 00:23:48,485
Speaker 7:  4 99 a month. Yeah.

453
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:48,765
Speaker 1:  And you,

454
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:50,205
Speaker 7:  For 50 songs you have to

455
00:23:50,205 --> 00:23:54,125
Speaker 1:  Pick, if I understand it correctly, you got to have 50 songs in your library

456
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:58,045
Speaker 1:  and then you could browse your friends' libraries and listen to their songs

457
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:02,095
Speaker 1:  too. So the only way to make your library bigger was

458
00:24:02,115 --> 00:24:05,895
Speaker 1:  to access all of your friends' libraries. But then at the end, just like

459
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:08,695
Speaker 1:  random strays of Justin Bieber that it's like hide your Justin Bieber songs

460
00:24:08,755 --> 00:24:11,255
Speaker 1:  so that your friends can't listen to them. Like I would like to listen to

461
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:12,575
Speaker 1:  Justin Bieber on my friend's playlist.

462
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,735
Speaker 7:  Okay. A lot of questions there. I I just want to once again

463
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:20,855
Speaker 7:  offer some context to the group. The iPod existed during this

464
00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:24,775
Speaker 7:  time, super existed. This was their attempt not to compete with the future

465
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:27,735
Speaker 7:  iPhone or whatever. They were like

466
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:32,435
Speaker 7:  the, the way we're gonna get the iPod is by charging

467
00:24:32,665 --> 00:24:36,595
Speaker 7:  $5 a month for you to have 50 songs that change

468
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:39,875
Speaker 7:  every month. And you have to make, you have to operate this database.

469
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:44,625
Speaker 7:  And meanwhile people are like, what I'm gonna do is open up Napster on my

470
00:24:44,855 --> 00:24:48,545
Speaker 7:  desktop computer and put 5 billion songs in my, my

471
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:49,305
Speaker 7:  iPod for free.

472
00:24:49,335 --> 00:24:53,225
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I remember trying to make my Blackberry like

473
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,945
Speaker 6:  an iPhone and I would side load music onto my Blackberry

474
00:24:57,905 --> 00:25:01,765
Speaker 6:  and it was a terrible experience. Yeah. So this was Blackberry being

475
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:05,565
Speaker 6:  like, you no longer have to put music on a micro SD

476
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:09,045
Speaker 6:  card or whatever card it was. Or use A-U-S-B-A micro

477
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:12,885
Speaker 6:  USB cord to side load from your BBM desktop app.

478
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:17,405
Speaker 6:  I did these things young Joanna did these things. Okay. This

479
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:21,125
Speaker 6:  was their solution to that. They're like, we will let you get the music through

480
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,205
Speaker 6:  our store. Yeah.

481
00:25:22,275 --> 00:25:23,165
Speaker 1:  Well and the reason I bring

482
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:26,565
Speaker 6:  This up, we were so far behind us Blackberry people, we were just trying

483
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:27,165
Speaker 6:  to keep up.

484
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:30,205
Speaker 7:  No, they just knew that you were Rich East coasters and they could milk you

485
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:30,965
Speaker 7:  for five extra dollars.

486
00:25:31,345 --> 00:25:31,765
Speaker 1:  Had an iPad.

487
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:36,285
Speaker 6:  I didn't care point. It wasn't just Rich East Coasters. There were the Canadians.

488
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:37,725
Speaker 7:  The Canadians. That's

489
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:40,965
Speaker 6:  True. There were the rich Canadians. There were the rich people in Hollywood.

490
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:41,445
Speaker 6:  Those,

491
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:43,845
Speaker 7:  Yeah, there were wealthy finance bros. All over the world.

492
00:25:44,465 --> 00:25:48,405
Speaker 6:  All over the world. People are BB Ming and they don't wanna go to

493
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:52,085
Speaker 6:  the iPhone yet because it's not on Verizon. It's not on and or any other

494
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:55,085
Speaker 6:  carrier really. I mean they started launching internationally when,

495
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:56,885
Speaker 7:  Right at the beginning.

496
00:25:57,145 --> 00:25:57,445
Speaker 6:  So yes,

497
00:25:57,545 --> 00:26:00,045
Speaker 7:  It was first in at t and then they started adding markets. Yeah. So

498
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:04,565
Speaker 6:  We are stuck. We are stuck with Blackberry. And so here comes

499
00:26:04,685 --> 00:26:06,485
Speaker 6:  BM music 4 99 a month.

500
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:09,765
Speaker 1:  And by the way, it's a BBM thing, which I think is really interest. Right.

501
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:10,125
Speaker 1:  And so this is,

502
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,405
Speaker 6:  This is the thing. They knew they couldn't do anything. They had to put it

503
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,605
Speaker 6:  into BBM. Right.

504
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:17,845
Speaker 1:  BBM was Blackberry's last move. Which I thought was so interesting. It's

505
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:20,485
Speaker 1:  like the 'cause at this point you're, you're right. Like we're we're you're

506
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:21,845
Speaker 6:  It was the stickiness. Exactly.

507
00:26:21,845 --> 00:26:22,445
Speaker 1:  Right. About the, you

508
00:26:22,445 --> 00:26:25,765
Speaker 7:  Know what else would've been sticky? Taping an iPod nano to the back of your

509
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:28,605
Speaker 7:  Blackberry. A choice you could have made at any

510
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:31,525
Speaker 6:  Time. But I did that. I was that person. I had the Blackberry, like I said,

511
00:26:31,745 --> 00:26:34,445
Speaker 6:  I'm side loading music to the Blackberry, but it's not working very

512
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:37,685
Speaker 7:  Well. Did you have the gadget pockets? Like you would like come home at the

513
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:39,765
Speaker 7:  end of the night Yeah. And you'd like take out your digital camera. Oh, absolutely.

514
00:26:39,905 --> 00:26:41,085
Speaker 7:  And your phone and your iPod.

515
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:44,925
Speaker 6:  I was a woman so I had a bag. Sure. Yeah. Remember the HTC rhyme? They made

516
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:48,765
Speaker 6:  that song for me. They made phones for women back then. So, but like I,

517
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:52,805
Speaker 6:  this was me. Yeah. Like I, and so maybe I paid for BM

518
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:54,965
Speaker 6:  music. I'm not, I'm not ashamed to say I might have.

519
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:59,055
Speaker 1:  You probably did. But before, so this, this is

520
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:03,415
Speaker 1:  the turning point, right? 'cause this is where actually I think it was

521
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:07,375
Speaker 1:  2010, that for the first time in several years, Blackberry stopped

522
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,495
Speaker 1:  being the bestselling smartphone brand. That was the year that Android in

523
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:14,295
Speaker 1:  particular. Oh yeah. Like I really, really just left it behind. But real

524
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:18,215
Speaker 1:  quick, before we get away from peak Blackberry, let me just show you a

525
00:27:18,215 --> 00:27:21,525
Speaker 1:  bunch of BBM ads from peak Blackberry.

526
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:25,525
Speaker 12:  BM feels like it's faster. He can set up these groups and everyone can have

527
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:25,805
Speaker 12:  input.

528
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:30,045
Speaker 13:  My friends were with a boy that I had a crush on. They made him leave

529
00:27:30,045 --> 00:27:33,565
Speaker 13:  me a voice note on Blackberry Messenger. I meet up my ringtone,

530
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:37,285
Speaker 14:  Snap a picture of the lamp, send it on over to them. And then I sold a piece

531
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:39,445
Speaker 14:  with Blackberry Messenger. If you read

532
00:27:39,445 --> 00:27:43,125
Speaker 15:  My BBM and you don't answer me, I know you read it. I love that.

533
00:27:43,685 --> 00:27:47,605
Speaker 1:  I just wanna point out, this is 2010. All of that existed everywhere

534
00:27:47,605 --> 00:27:47,725
Speaker 1:  else.

535
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:49,205
Speaker 6:  It's just like

536
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:53,645
Speaker 1:  Blackberry was just like pretending that it still had something to

537
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:56,485
Speaker 1:  hold onto, but it was the thing that kept people using blackberries. But

538
00:27:56,485 --> 00:27:56,605
Speaker 1:  you

539
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:58,565
Speaker 7:  Could just run that ad about WhatsApp today.

540
00:27:58,745 --> 00:27:59,605
Speaker 1:  Oh mean Hunter,

541
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:02,885
Speaker 7:  I message this is still how we communicate about everything, right? Yeah.

542
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:06,325
Speaker 7:  Like I had a crush on a boy. So I texted a friend, I sent a picture of a

543
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:09,005
Speaker 7:  lamp to someone and they bought it. Yeah. Like what are we do? It's

544
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:11,685
Speaker 1:  All the same. It's, it's the playbook. It is wild. How much of this BM got

545
00:28:11,685 --> 00:28:12,085
Speaker 1:  right? And then right

546
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:15,325
Speaker 7:  At the end you get the, the the, you know, the the dark haired girl with

547
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:18,005
Speaker 7:  the big sunglasses being like, I'm from New York. Can

548
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:18,565
Speaker 6:  I read something

549
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:19,365
Speaker 1:  Blackberry, please.

550
00:28:19,685 --> 00:28:20,845
Speaker 6:  I wanna set fir first of all,

551
00:28:20,845 --> 00:28:24,085
Speaker 7:  Oh, I've lived in New York for like 15 years. I I it's fine. Well

552
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:27,645
Speaker 6:  It's true. I wanna read this. This is an editorial I wrote for in

553
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,965
Speaker 6:  Gadget at the end of 2010. Okay. When I was

554
00:28:31,195 --> 00:28:34,645
Speaker 6:  getting ready to get rid of my Blackberry. And I wrote,

555
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:38,845
Speaker 6:  I'm more than aware that many don't understand the appeal of BBM.

556
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:42,005
Speaker 6:  Notably nearly all my fellow gadget editors.

557
00:28:43,865 --> 00:28:45,485
Speaker 1:  So you got bullied out of using was

558
00:28:45,485 --> 00:28:46,525
Speaker 7:  Actual roasted on my own

559
00:28:46,595 --> 00:28:49,485
Speaker 6:  Page, most of my closest friends and family have blackberries and the native

560
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:53,325
Speaker 6:  messaging client absolutely destroys text messaging in terms of

561
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:54,525
Speaker 6:  speed and capabilities.

562
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:58,685
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. It was, it it probably, it was still true in 20 10, 2

563
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:00,445
Speaker 6:  Weeks later I got an Android phone. Yeah.

564
00:29:00,935 --> 00:29:04,405
Speaker 7:  Right. Because the reason that none of your fellow eng gadget editors would

565
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:08,645
Speaker 7:  use a Blackberry and use BM with you is because we all had smart, like

566
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:09,965
Speaker 7:  proper smartphones.

567
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:11,005
Speaker 6:  You edited this

568
00:29:11,545 --> 00:29:11,965
Speaker 1:  Almost

569
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:15,765
Speaker 7:  Certainly. Yes. 'cause I had an iPhone and I was like, Joanna

570
00:29:15,765 --> 00:29:19,085
Speaker 7:  needs to mourn before she joins the rest of us in the future. Well

571
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:22,045
Speaker 1:  But it but by that point, the only reason people stuck around was because

572
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:24,605
Speaker 1:  there were the people who were like, no, I need the keyboard. That was me.

573
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:25,605
Speaker 1:  Like that was still the time when

574
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:26,845
Speaker 6:  BBM keyboard people

575
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:30,445
Speaker 1:  Were absolutely convinced that the keyboard was better. And even if you sort

576
00:29:30,445 --> 00:29:32,365
Speaker 1:  of understood the point of a touchscreen, you're like, no, I type a lot.

577
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:36,245
Speaker 1:  I need the keyboard. And we had not broken that by this period.

578
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:36,725
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

579
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:40,525
Speaker 6:  And in fact, the reason I got the droid too was 'cause it had a slide out

580
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:40,765
Speaker 6:  keyboard.

581
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:45,365
Speaker 1:  There you go. Yeah. So the infamous slide out keyboard that super lasted

582
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:47,605
Speaker 1:  a long time and all phones have them now. Right. I

583
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:49,165
Speaker 4:  Was very good typer on there.

584
00:29:49,425 --> 00:29:52,605
Speaker 1:  The thing that I, Mike Lazarus would not have said at the time, but believed

585
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:56,445
Speaker 1:  at the time and is, is true, was that BBM was the only thing that

586
00:29:56,445 --> 00:30:00,085
Speaker 1:  still mattered at Black Gray. And they knew it. This is the thing like even

587
00:30:00,085 --> 00:30:04,045
Speaker 1:  going back, right? 'cause it was sticky Rim Rim knew it. And we need to take

588
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:07,565
Speaker 1:  a break, but then we're gonna come back and I'm gonna tell you how Blackberry

589
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:10,885
Speaker 1:  tried to get BBM to save the company. We'll be right back

590
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:47,985
Speaker 1:  Alright, we're back. So now let's go to like

591
00:30:48,485 --> 00:30:52,305
Speaker 1:  2013. So there's actually some reporting

592
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:56,385
Speaker 1:  years ago that BBM had a working

593
00:30:56,635 --> 00:31:00,305
Speaker 1:  cross platform and desktop version that would've worked everywhere as early

594
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:04,025
Speaker 1:  as 2010. But the executives chose not to release it

595
00:31:04,115 --> 00:31:07,585
Speaker 1:  based on the, it's the same theory as iMessage, right? It's like if we make

596
00:31:07,585 --> 00:31:11,185
Speaker 1:  it easy to use the best thing about our platform on someone else's platform,

597
00:31:11,325 --> 00:31:15,305
Speaker 1:  people will leave our platform. Right? And this is happening in 2010 and

598
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:18,905
Speaker 1:  there's like one idea says BBM is our best asset. We need to put it everywhere

599
00:31:18,905 --> 00:31:21,785
Speaker 1:  and get everybody using it. And it it becomes our thing. There's another

600
00:31:21,785 --> 00:31:24,945
Speaker 1:  that is like, no, we have to sell blackberries and the only way we'll sell

601
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:27,985
Speaker 1:  blackberries is if people keep using BBM. So these two sides keep fighting.

602
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:31,265
Speaker 1:  This is like the oldest tech story effort. Yeah. Like every company does

603
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:35,225
Speaker 1:  this at some point and the executives end up choosing

604
00:31:35,525 --> 00:31:39,105
Speaker 1:  to keep it all bundled together, which I think you could argue is ultimately

605
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:42,425
Speaker 1:  what killed the whole thing. But a thing that I learned is that Jim Balsley

606
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:45,745
Speaker 1:  played by our, our boy Glenn Howerton in the Blackberry movie.

607
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,505
Speaker 1:  His big idea for BBM at the time was to essentially turn it into a OL, right?

608
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:54,345
Speaker 1:  Like m music is actually a sort of a, a, a nod

609
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,945
Speaker 1:  at that idea. But it's like, what if we made this into a walled garden that

610
00:31:57,945 --> 00:32:01,065
Speaker 1:  was like the whole internet, like truly embrace the super app idea. It's

611
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:04,345
Speaker 1:  like we're gonna go all in, it's gonna be amazing. People are gonna pay money.

612
00:32:04,345 --> 00:32:06,345
Speaker 1:  It's gonna be the thing that keeps you on blackberries, they'll buy the devices

613
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:10,185
Speaker 1:  just to use this thing. It's like we're we're gonna make it Facebook essentially.

614
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:14,585
Speaker 1:  And the goal was to like get past carriers, eat

615
00:32:14,585 --> 00:32:18,025
Speaker 1:  competition. Like really sort of build everything into

616
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:21,705
Speaker 1:  BBM and charge money for people to use BBM. But at this point, Jim Bosley

617
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:25,625
Speaker 1:  is not the CEO of Blackberry anymore. Torsten Hinz is the ceo Blackberry,

618
00:32:25,805 --> 00:32:29,585
Speaker 1:  he killed the whole thing because part of Jim's plan was to make

619
00:32:29,585 --> 00:32:32,625
Speaker 1:  this platform more important than devices, which would've ultimately like

620
00:32:32,815 --> 00:32:35,945
Speaker 1:  made them go across platform. So they get rid of that Jim quits

621
00:32:36,845 --> 00:32:40,365
Speaker 1:  and then it all just continues to fall apart.

622
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:41,205
Speaker 7:  So

623
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:43,845
Speaker 1:  Like, so there's this idea, right? That like, okay, we can put these two

624
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:46,245
Speaker 1:  things together and there are lots of people who want it and it'll stay sticky.

625
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:49,285
Speaker 1:  And even if we don't keep growing and the market keeps growing, it'll still

626
00:32:49,285 --> 00:32:49,925
Speaker 1:  work. Right?

627
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:53,765
Speaker 7:  And I just wanna come back to did not everyone knew from the very

628
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:57,685
Speaker 7:  beginning that messaging apps were sticky. Yeah. Right? All the way

629
00:32:57,685 --> 00:33:01,485
Speaker 7:  at the beginning. Like the government is just rewind your brain to be like

630
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:05,445
Speaker 7:  the, the Federal Trade Commission and the F CCC understand that a OL

631
00:33:05,445 --> 00:33:09,165
Speaker 7:  into messenger is so sticky that if you let Time Warner buy it, there'll

632
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:11,925
Speaker 7:  be an unstoppable behemoth. Again, this turned out not to be true,

633
00:33:12,985 --> 00:33:16,965
Speaker 7:  but I think what people also didn't really understand is when that

634
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:18,765
Speaker 7:  stickiness goes, it goes all at once.

635
00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:20,085
Speaker 1:  Right? Right.

636
00:33:20,105 --> 00:33:23,525
Speaker 7:  And when people leave a messaging platform, they're all gone

637
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:25,565
Speaker 7:  immediately. Right. There's no whole, and

638
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:29,445
Speaker 1:  The, and the way it happens is when there is some sort of inflection point

639
00:33:29,455 --> 00:33:31,645
Speaker 1:  event. Yeah. And that thing was the iPhone and,

640
00:33:31,905 --> 00:33:32,125
Speaker 7:  And

641
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:34,845
Speaker 1:  Some combination of the iPhone and Android, which essentially happened at

642
00:33:34,845 --> 00:33:38,245
Speaker 1:  the same time was like, it just, it it unstuck the whole thing.

643
00:33:38,305 --> 00:33:41,645
Speaker 7:  Yep. And then, and then in particular 2011

644
00:33:42,285 --> 00:33:46,085
Speaker 7:  iMessage it as Intru. Yeah. Right. So then this all goes to hell. But

645
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:50,165
Speaker 7:  the, I I think it's so interesting that people knew how sticky and

646
00:33:50,525 --> 00:33:54,325
Speaker 7:  powerful a messaging platform was so early like so, so early

647
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:58,245
Speaker 7:  everybody knew and Blackberry was like, well we have this thing, we can just

648
00:33:58,305 --> 00:34:01,525
Speaker 7:  bet on this thing to keep selling the phones. And what no one had quite figured

649
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:05,405
Speaker 7:  out is when they go, they just go, right, right.

650
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:08,525
Speaker 7:  There's no, there's no fading monopoly. It's just tomorrow it's gone.

651
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:11,485
Speaker 1:  I mean this is kind of the thing I was wondering, right? Is like the other

652
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:14,725
Speaker 1:  thing that happens right around now is WhatsApp becomes a thing and just

653
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:17,885
Speaker 1:  immediately takes over the world and like

654
00:34:18,585 --> 00:34:22,445
Speaker 1:  it did the cross platform thing that like people inside of

655
00:34:22,605 --> 00:34:26,005
Speaker 1:  research in Motion have been trying to do for years. And part of me wonders

656
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:29,325
Speaker 1:  like is there a world in which BBM got this right?

657
00:34:29,905 --> 00:34:32,605
Speaker 1:  But then to your point, there's all this other stuff happening simultaneously

658
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:36,005
Speaker 1:  that it's like maybe even if they had played all of their cards correctly,

659
00:34:36,055 --> 00:34:39,565
Speaker 1:  short of building better phones, like if they had done all the software things

660
00:34:39,565 --> 00:34:39,885
Speaker 1:  Right.

661
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:42,335
Speaker 7:  Short of building better phones, which is not,

662
00:34:42,335 --> 00:34:44,975
Speaker 1:  Which is not nothing. Right? Yeah. Like if they had made every good BBM decision,

663
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:49,015
Speaker 1:  which they didn't, but if they had, could it have worked? I think it's it

664
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:52,095
Speaker 1:  there's a strong chance the answer is just no. 'cause there were too many

665
00:34:52,095 --> 00:34:52,655
Speaker 1:  other things

666
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:56,335
Speaker 7:  Much coming forward all at once. Think how much revenue they would've Yeah.

667
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,415
Speaker 7:  Had to have given up. That's right. I mean it's just like straightforwardly.

668
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:03,295
Speaker 7:  They make money selling blackberries the hardware, the service

669
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:07,255
Speaker 7:  to the carrier and then BBM is just like riding along on top of it.

670
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:10,975
Speaker 7:  And then maybe you're buying $5 a month for BM Music, whatever.

671
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,615
Speaker 7:  Three people were nonsense. You're

672
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:15,375
Speaker 1:  Doing Jim B's plan was that you'd pay for it like a OL which

673
00:35:15,785 --> 00:35:18,575
Speaker 7:  Right. So worked pretty well for a pretty long time. We're gonna take one

674
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,775
Speaker 7:  part of our whole business and we're gonna put it on Apple's platform, which

675
00:35:21,775 --> 00:35:25,535
Speaker 7:  wants to kill us. Right. And we're gonna say somehow this costs

676
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:29,135
Speaker 7:  money and there's no in-app purchasing back, like none of this stuff

677
00:35:29,235 --> 00:35:32,775
Speaker 7:  exists yet. Right. And we're just gonna give away free texting

678
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:36,855
Speaker 7:  and Apple's gonna take a 30% cut. Well none of that exists yet either, right?

679
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:40,445
Speaker 7:  Like I mean too far after these these these like Titanic fights don't exist.

680
00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:43,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And then even now you get to, I don't know, WhatsApp and it's not like

681
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:47,445
Speaker 7:  WhatsApp makes a bunch of money for meta. Like it's an advertising surface.

682
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:51,805
Speaker 7:  They charge businesses to text people. It's big around the world. But

683
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:55,685
Speaker 7:  they had to invent all of this new business model. Blackberry

684
00:35:55,845 --> 00:35:59,725
Speaker 7:  could not be like, what we're gonna do is we're gonna destroy our

685
00:35:59,745 --> 00:36:03,605
Speaker 7:  big rich business and then spend 20 years figuring out how to make

686
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:06,765
Speaker 7:  BBMA business and Apple's platform. Like I don't think, I don't think that

687
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,045
Speaker 7:  would've been a rational decision ever.

688
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:11,925
Speaker 6:  No. And what you saw happen was others just followed this playbook,

689
00:36:13,065 --> 00:36:14,485
Speaker 6:  pun in pun intended,

690
00:36:16,415 --> 00:36:17,125
Speaker 6:  which is Apple.

691
00:36:17,195 --> 00:36:19,285
Speaker 1:  They didn't follow the playbook. They followed, they followed

692
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:20,365
Speaker 6:  A playbook. They A playbook. Well

693
00:36:20,365 --> 00:36:22,845
Speaker 7:  Apple, well no, a lot of people made shitty seven inch tablets. Like that

694
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:24,125
Speaker 7:  playbook was deeply followed.

695
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:27,645
Speaker 6:  That's true. That's true. That's fair. But Apple tries to do it with iMessage.

696
00:36:27,705 --> 00:36:31,645
Speaker 6:  Google does it in a more open way and makes 7,000 different messaging platforms

697
00:36:31,675 --> 00:36:34,165
Speaker 6:  over the next seven years, 10 years. And

698
00:36:34,165 --> 00:36:35,645
Speaker 7:  People's like, what if we don't run this company?

699
00:36:37,465 --> 00:36:40,285
Speaker 6:  And that's what hardware manufacturers started to try to do.

700
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:44,605
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. Alright, so we're, we're near the end of

701
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:47,405
Speaker 1:  the BBM story, but I just, I have two more moments I wanted to tell you guys

702
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:51,325
Speaker 1:  about. One does, do you remember in 2011 when the BBM network went down?

703
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:52,645
Speaker 6:  I do. Of

704
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:52,765
Speaker 7:  Course

705
00:36:52,765 --> 00:36:55,605
Speaker 6:  You do. I covered it. Yeah. But I didn't have a Blackberry then.

706
00:36:55,605 --> 00:36:57,365
Speaker 7:  Yeah. This was like breaking news. This was

707
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:58,005
Speaker 6:  A big news. I

708
00:36:58,165 --> 00:37:00,205
Speaker 1:  Remember covering it. Me, let me just play you some of the news coverage

709
00:37:00,205 --> 00:37:01,005
Speaker 1:  from this outage.

710
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:05,085
Speaker 17:  Blackberry users are losing access to email, text messaging and

711
00:37:05,185 --> 00:37:07,845
Speaker 17:  web browsing. Everything. You would own a Blackberry for

712
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:12,285
Speaker 18:  Exasperated Blackberry users gave vent their frustration with the slowed

713
00:37:12,285 --> 00:37:14,605
Speaker 18:  down services over the last 36 hours.

714
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,605
Speaker 19:  I'm feeling quite depressed and lonely because no one's getting back to

715
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:21,485
Speaker 19:  me. My phone's not popping off like it used to pop off. So it's not, it's

716
00:37:21,485 --> 00:37:22,645
Speaker 19:  not a good look at the moment. Blackberry,

717
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:26,645
Speaker 20:  I have had no communication or emails for two days and it's really annoying.

718
00:37:28,395 --> 00:37:28,885
Speaker 6:  Amazing.

719
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:32,285
Speaker 7:  The guy's like, my phone's not popping off pop off my phone. That's, he's

720
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:36,245
Speaker 7:  my hero. Like that's the whole verge. Like that's what we do here.

721
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:39,645
Speaker 7:  We're like, the whole culture is like, is your phone popping off? Like his

722
00:37:39,645 --> 00:37:42,565
Speaker 7:  phone was not, nations rise and fall on whether or not these phones pop off.

723
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:44,565
Speaker 6:  His phone was not popping off. So this is

724
00:37:44,675 --> 00:37:48,605
Speaker 1:  What happens next in, in 2013 Blackberry, the

725
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:51,685
Speaker 1:  company is essentially like falling apart, right? Like it's, it's a mess

726
00:37:51,825 --> 00:37:55,645
Speaker 1:  in so many ways. It's market share is shot. And I believe this was a

727
00:37:55,665 --> 00:37:59,365
Speaker 1:  really great Wall Street Journal piece from many years ago that they understood

728
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:03,045
Speaker 1:  that BBM was like kind of the only remaining asset in the company. So they,

729
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:06,805
Speaker 1:  they actually think about spinning it out. They're gonna call it BBM Inc.

730
00:38:07,145 --> 00:38:10,325
Speaker 1:  And the plan is to turn it into like WhatsApp or Skype. Do you remember this?

731
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:14,405
Speaker 1:  Yes. It was, this was such a fun, like weird alternative history

732
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:18,365
Speaker 1:  to go down where BBM Inc is a thing that exists. They were also gonna do

733
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:21,965
Speaker 1:  BBM channels, which was basically like a telegram clone. Again, like a lot

734
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:25,645
Speaker 1:  of correct ideas just at weird times and with really bizarre

735
00:38:25,645 --> 00:38:29,285
Speaker 1:  execution at this point. This is 2013 BBM, how many

736
00:38:29,295 --> 00:38:31,685
Speaker 1:  users do you think BBM still had in 2013?

737
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:35,245
Speaker 1:  Just guess within 10 million.

738
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:36,765
Speaker 7:  Within 10 million. Within

739
00:38:36,785 --> 00:38:38,245
Speaker 1:  10 million. There's your hint.

740
00:38:38,745 --> 00:38:39,445
Speaker 7:  Is it 10 million?

741
00:38:39,555 --> 00:38:41,485
Speaker 1:  It's not 10, it's more than 10 million. Oh

742
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:41,965
Speaker 6:  6 million.

743
00:38:42,745 --> 00:38:42,965
Speaker 7:  No,

744
00:38:42,965 --> 00:38:44,645
Speaker 1:  She's just famously more than 10 million.

745
00:38:45,145 --> 00:38:45,565
Speaker 7:  That's

746
00:38:45,565 --> 00:38:46,445
Speaker 1:  Not 60. That's the

747
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:47,485
Speaker 7:  60 million

748
00:38:47,485 --> 00:38:51,285
Speaker 1:  People still using PBM in 2013. Unclear how

749
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:53,045
Speaker 1:  share 50 songs at a time. I guess

750
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:57,205
Speaker 6:  Maybe it was just the install base had the, like everyone who had

751
00:38:57,245 --> 00:38:58,045
Speaker 6:  a phone had

752
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,925
Speaker 7:  BBM. Was that BBM with with the app strategy or BBM on the phones? You

753
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:02,365
Speaker 7:  have no idea

754
00:39:02,435 --> 00:39:04,245
Speaker 1:  This was, this was like the total BBM

755
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:05,445
Speaker 7:  Including the weird apps. They

756
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:06,885
Speaker 1:  Universe. I think so, yeah.

757
00:39:07,065 --> 00:39:10,245
Speaker 6:  But they actually only had like a couple of million users

758
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:13,725
Speaker 1:  Probably. Yeah. That was like, this is how many people, it does not make

759
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:15,125
Speaker 1:  sense. Had access to it sense. Well

760
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:18,925
Speaker 7:  The iPhone wasn't out in all these markets yet. Right? I mean for a huge

761
00:39:18,925 --> 00:39:22,165
Speaker 7:  number of years, Apple's entire growth strategy was like, yeah, we discovered

762
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:24,365
Speaker 7:  another country now ship a new country now. Now the iPhone has it. Right?

763
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:25,085
Speaker 7:  Right. Like are you,

764
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:25,725
Speaker 6:  We looked at a map.

765
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:29,205
Speaker 7:  Are you aware of China? Apple's twice as big as it was before. Like every

766
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:30,685
Speaker 7:  year they were doing this. But

767
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:33,645
Speaker 1:  Even just to give you another example, like in 2013, WhatsApp already had

768
00:39:33,645 --> 00:39:37,485
Speaker 1:  300 million users. So it was like the BBM was still around, but it was,

769
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:41,285
Speaker 1:  it was already like completely left for dead. And like you said,

770
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:44,645
Speaker 1:  that was the year they shipped all the other apps. Finally they like, they,

771
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:48,085
Speaker 1:  they launched everywhere else. A thing that I learned was that the Android

772
00:39:48,405 --> 00:39:52,365
Speaker 1:  a PK leaked before the official announcement and was

773
00:39:52,365 --> 00:39:55,365
Speaker 1:  so popular and Blackberry was so unready for it that they had to pause the

774
00:39:55,365 --> 00:39:59,325
Speaker 1:  rollout of BBM for a month. Wow. 'cause like a million people all tried to

775
00:39:59,485 --> 00:40:03,085
Speaker 1:  download this leaked version of the app and it broke the whole system so

776
00:40:03,085 --> 00:40:07,045
Speaker 1:  spectacularly that they had to delay the launch for a month.

777
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:11,245
Speaker 1:  They tried pre-install it on LG phones when it came out, which Sure.

778
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:14,205
Speaker 7:  Perfect. That's a thing you could do. That's a perfect, it's probably on

779
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:14,605
Speaker 7:  Sprint. You

780
00:40:14,605 --> 00:40:15,845
Speaker 6:  Know what, this is also the era of

781
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:18,365
Speaker 7:  Like the pre-install app on the LG phone on Sprint. Yeah. Is how you know

782
00:40:18,365 --> 00:40:18,725
Speaker 7:  you're dying.

783
00:40:18,795 --> 00:40:22,045
Speaker 1:  Okay. Real quick though, let me just show you a chart that I found from a

784
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:25,405
Speaker 1:  company called Diso, which is, it's from November of 2013

785
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:29,445
Speaker 1:  and it shows the, the various messaging apps

786
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:32,485
Speaker 1:  share in a bunch of different countries around the world. And it's kind of

787
00:40:32,485 --> 00:40:35,885
Speaker 1:  wild. And you have in places like India and Indonesia,

788
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:40,165
Speaker 1:  it's still like a third of the market. These are huge markets like the It

789
00:40:40,165 --> 00:40:44,045
Speaker 1:  is, it is both very easy to lose this sort of momentum

790
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:47,965
Speaker 1:  and stickiness, but it's also very hard to kill a messaging app. Yeah. And

791
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:52,405
Speaker 1:  in a lot of these places, especially before things like

792
00:40:52,835 --> 00:40:56,565
Speaker 1:  Fast internet showed up a lot of places like it, it lingered so like it it

793
00:40:56,565 --> 00:40:59,005
Speaker 1:  didn't, it was hard to kill BBM

794
00:40:59,985 --> 00:41:01,595
Speaker 7:  Then we actually did do it. It just

795
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:02,195
Speaker 1:  Goes right.

796
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:02,635
Speaker 7:  And

797
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:05,555
Speaker 1:  I then it happened country by country in the same way that you're describing.

798
00:41:05,815 --> 00:41:09,475
Speaker 7:  And I, you can see that even with like little social networks, like this

799
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:13,115
Speaker 7:  is an experience we now have fairly often where something like Be Real shows

800
00:41:13,115 --> 00:41:16,555
Speaker 7:  up and it's like everyone's on Be Real and then like the next day it's like

801
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:19,555
Speaker 7:  Be Real has gone out of business. Right. Right. Because there's no business

802
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:23,475
Speaker 7:  model. It's for everyone's using your network unless you have like

803
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:26,755
Speaker 7:  sustained usage. And I, I don't think Blackberry, I don't think they could

804
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:29,955
Speaker 7:  have ever made that term with BBM. It was just fundamentally too hostile

805
00:41:30,095 --> 00:41:31,755
Speaker 7:  to the actual fund platforms themselves.

806
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:34,805
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. All right. Right. We need to take a break, but really quick before

807
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:37,605
Speaker 1:  we do, what year do you think BBM finally went away?

808
00:41:39,685 --> 00:41:41,965
Speaker 7:  I mean Jan is still using it from what I, from what I gather,

809
00:41:42,685 --> 00:41:44,665
Speaker 1:  2019 BM was eventually sold to somebody else.

810
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:45,545
Speaker 7:  Of course.

811
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:47,345
Speaker 1:  What year? What year do you think

812
00:41:47,345 --> 00:41:48,705
Speaker 7:  It's the same private equity, right?

813
00:41:48,935 --> 00:41:51,065
Speaker 1:  They wrote a sad blog post about how it was going away. What year do you

814
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:51,345
Speaker 1:  think it was?

815
00:41:52,185 --> 00:41:53,205
Speaker 6:  2019.

816
00:41:54,005 --> 00:41:54,885
Speaker 7:  1719

817
00:41:54,885 --> 00:41:56,085
Speaker 1:  Is right. It's 2019.

818
00:41:57,005 --> 00:41:57,765
Speaker 6:  I prepared for the show

819
00:41:57,965 --> 00:42:00,445
Speaker 1:  And they claimed there were still people using PBM in

820
00:42:00,445 --> 00:42:03,965
Speaker 7:  2019. I just came here with like class warfare. There's no other preparation.

821
00:42:05,225 --> 00:42:05,445
Speaker 1:  You

822
00:42:05,465 --> 00:42:06,005
Speaker 6:  Get the spot.

823
00:42:06,675 --> 00:42:09,085
Speaker 1:  Alright, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna go back and we're

824
00:42:09,085 --> 00:42:11,845
Speaker 1:  gonna get to the version history questions. We'll be right back.

825
00:42:45,385 --> 00:42:49,195
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. We have eight questions that we ask about every

826
00:42:49,315 --> 00:42:53,035
Speaker 1:  single thing we do on version history. Question number one, what was the

827
00:42:53,035 --> 00:42:54,555
Speaker 1:  best thing about BBM?

828
00:42:55,735 --> 00:42:58,955
Speaker 7:  Oh, the absolute best thing about BBM is somebody who didn't use it and only

829
00:42:58,955 --> 00:43:02,515
Speaker 7:  made fun of my elite Mid East Coast friends

830
00:43:02,775 --> 00:43:06,315
Speaker 7:  was the number of celebrities who were addicted to their black. Remember

831
00:43:06,315 --> 00:43:10,075
Speaker 7:  we called them crack berries and it wasn't 'cause they were emailing or using

832
00:43:10,175 --> 00:43:14,035
Speaker 7:  the web browser. It's 'cause they were on BBM all day long. And there's just

833
00:43:14,035 --> 00:43:17,635
Speaker 7:  video after video of like Drake and Marlon Waynes and Anna

834
00:43:17,635 --> 00:43:21,595
Speaker 7:  Kendrick, like two thou. Stacey Keebler being like, I love my Blackberry.

835
00:43:21,595 --> 00:43:23,435
Speaker 7:  And it's like, oh, this is hilarious. Like it is

836
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:27,035
Speaker 1:  Maybe the first example of like full on

837
00:43:27,115 --> 00:43:30,115
Speaker 1:  smartphone addiction. Yeah. It was just like, 'cause there were, they like

838
00:43:30,115 --> 00:43:31,275
Speaker 1:  the CrackBerry thing was real and

839
00:43:31,415 --> 00:43:32,795
Speaker 7:  My phone stopped popping off like it used to.

840
00:43:32,795 --> 00:43:35,395
Speaker 1:  There were like medical opinions about people who were addicted that are

841
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:37,555
Speaker 1:  BlackBerrys and, and it was, it was because of BBM. Yeah.

842
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:39,275
Speaker 7:  And it was just 'cause they were talking to their friends all day. Yeah.

843
00:43:39,275 --> 00:43:41,795
Speaker 7:  And like you can see, you can take that right out and be like, well, democracy's

844
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:45,355
Speaker 7:  in danger. But like, we'll just rewind. The best thing about BBM was all

845
00:43:45,675 --> 00:43:49,035
Speaker 7:  of these celebrities constantly at every event, just like

846
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:52,955
Speaker 7:  Bradley Cooper being like, I love it. I can't live without it. It's, it is,

847
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:54,795
Speaker 7:  we should run some of them. No, I'm,

848
00:43:54,795 --> 00:43:57,955
Speaker 21:  I'm, I'm addicted to it. It's awful. I actually prefer it to talking.

849
00:43:58,415 --> 00:44:00,275
Speaker 22:  I'm double fisted with blackberries. Hey.

850
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:04,075
Speaker 23:  Oh, I call it CrackBerry. I'm so addicted. Oh my gosh.

851
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:08,275
Speaker 24:  I email and I like pinning and I like Blackberry messenger.

852
00:44:08,365 --> 00:44:12,115
Speaker 25:  Blackberry. I, I, I use this little thing for everything so my

853
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:15,155
Speaker 25:  life's in here. If I lose this, I don't know who I am, what I'm doing.

854
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:18,395
Speaker 1:  It's very good. Joanna, what do you think best thing about bb MI

855
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:18,995
Speaker 6:  Mean everything.

856
00:44:21,055 --> 00:44:22,115
Speaker 7:  The spot. Say meeting

857
00:44:22,135 --> 00:44:25,875
Speaker 6:  At it. I say the one thing that I, and David, I know you have opinions on

858
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:28,315
Speaker 6:  this, but you could do an away message.

859
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:29,235
Speaker 1:  Yes. Ooh,

860
00:44:29,915 --> 00:44:33,765
Speaker 6:  I know, I know you have thoughts. I do. But you could tell people

861
00:44:33,795 --> 00:44:36,405
Speaker 6:  your status in BBM.

862
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:37,885
Speaker 1:  That was my answer too. With a little

863
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:38,645
Speaker 6:  Emoji. Just

864
00:44:38,795 --> 00:44:42,685
Speaker 1:  Like, and, and when that died, it never came back.

865
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:45,845
Speaker 1:  Never came. They all have it now. You can do status in like Instagram and

866
00:44:45,845 --> 00:44:48,245
Speaker 1:  stuff. No one cares. Nobody looks at that stuff. It's irrelevant. You

867
00:44:48,245 --> 00:44:49,805
Speaker 6:  Can do it in WhatsApp. Right?

868
00:44:50,945 --> 00:44:52,585
Speaker 1:  I think it's, it's the same like cross meta

869
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:54,025
Speaker 6:  When it it comes to iMessage, I will use it.

870
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,675
Speaker 1:  I probably will too, but it's

871
00:44:56,675 --> 00:44:58,035
Speaker 6:  Like, it's gotta come though. And why wouldn't

872
00:44:58,055 --> 00:45:00,675
Speaker 1:  It? But it was, it was the right complicated and thing and it should come

873
00:45:00,675 --> 00:45:03,515
Speaker 1:  back. I agree. It was, it was the away message. Yeah. Bring back the away

874
00:45:03,515 --> 00:45:04,235
Speaker 1:  message. All

875
00:45:04,395 --> 00:45:05,995
Speaker 7:  Flirting was conducted by away message.

876
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:07,635
Speaker 1:  Oh yeah. And especially,

877
00:45:07,775 --> 00:45:10,395
Speaker 7:  Here's our fragment of the song lyric that is super about you. Totally

878
00:45:10,765 --> 00:45:13,595
Speaker 1:  Right. And if the sound I'm talking about was the more I wanted you to reach

879
00:45:13,595 --> 00:45:15,675
Speaker 1:  out to me about it. Right. Alright.

880
00:45:15,775 --> 00:45:19,595
Speaker 6:  And you would leave it, you would put that up like you were going out for

881
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:23,555
Speaker 6:  the night and you put that up and then you'd come back and be like, what,

882
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:27,275
Speaker 6:  what was I thinking? Like that, that's how like far away

883
00:45:27,495 --> 00:45:29,355
Speaker 6:  you would be from your computer for

884
00:45:29,355 --> 00:45:31,315
Speaker 1:  All that time. Oh yeah. You couldn't just go back and turn it off. Right.

885
00:45:31,455 --> 00:45:33,355
Speaker 1:  It was, it was that dashboard concessional song

886
00:45:33,615 --> 00:45:37,595
Speaker 6:  All night. Exactly. You, you committed to that lyric for the night or

887
00:45:37,855 --> 00:45:41,555
Speaker 6:  two days if you left your computer, if you were crazy like me in college

888
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:42,515
Speaker 6:  and just, what was the

889
00:45:42,675 --> 00:45:46,555
Speaker 7:  Complain of an away message on a phone? This is by the one I just, what,

890
00:45:46,555 --> 00:45:48,755
Speaker 7:  what were you setting away messages on bb m You,

891
00:45:48,755 --> 00:45:49,275
Speaker 6:  You were Could stop

892
00:45:49,515 --> 00:45:50,475
Speaker 1:  A meeting. Your phone meeting.

893
00:45:50,475 --> 00:45:52,155
Speaker 7:  Yeah. You were in in in college. Well,

894
00:45:52,155 --> 00:45:53,155
Speaker 1:  But no, but again, it was it

895
00:45:53,345 --> 00:45:54,675
Speaker 6:  Recording the vergecast

896
00:45:55,215 --> 00:45:59,115
Speaker 1:  BBB M got so quickly to that thing of like, yes. It, it hit the you are

897
00:45:59,275 --> 00:46:00,395
Speaker 1:  expected to respond quickly. I just

898
00:46:00,495 --> 00:46:04,155
Speaker 7:  So fast. I just had this image of like, Joanna in college. No, I

899
00:46:04,155 --> 00:46:04,795
Speaker 6:  Didn't have it in college.

900
00:46:04,905 --> 00:46:07,755
Speaker 7:  Okay. When I were you in your first job and you're like, I'm going into a

901
00:46:07,755 --> 00:46:11,715
Speaker 7:  meeting, I have to type a dashboard, confessional lyrics into my hardware

902
00:46:12,155 --> 00:46:14,755
Speaker 6:  Keyboard. This was, that was aim. I was doing that in

903
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:15,915
Speaker 1:  Gotta

904
00:46:15,915 --> 00:46:19,235
Speaker 6:  Go. No, no, that was in my dorm room. I was putting in the dashboard confessional.

905
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:21,755
Speaker 7:  I I'm with you on aim. I just didn't understand

906
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:24,835
Speaker 6:  Black friend had cheated on me or whatever it was. And then I've gotta go

907
00:46:24,855 --> 00:46:28,395
Speaker 6:  out and then by the end of the night I'm back with my boyfriend and I'm like,

908
00:46:28,415 --> 00:46:32,315
Speaker 6:  oh my gosh, I've revealed this. My aim message

909
00:46:32,535 --> 00:46:36,435
Speaker 6:  is still that. Yeah, that's how long it would take to update this stuff.

910
00:46:36,455 --> 00:46:39,515
Speaker 6:  And then you would get it on your, we would have this on B BM and we could

911
00:46:39,515 --> 00:46:40,675
Speaker 6:  do it wherever we

912
00:46:40,675 --> 00:46:41,195
Speaker 1:  Were. It could be. So

913
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:44,715
Speaker 7:  We, for the Youngs who are listening to this, I just want to, I just wanna

914
00:46:44,715 --> 00:46:48,275
Speaker 7:  offer an example. Yes. How effective any of this ever actually was. I ended

915
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:51,515
Speaker 7:  up marrying the girl who lived in the dorm room next to mine.

916
00:46:52,255 --> 00:46:56,115
Speaker 7:  You wouldn't She date me for eight years because the away message Eness

917
00:46:56,135 --> 00:46:59,915
Speaker 7:  was so strong. She's like, you're a mess. Like, you just figure out how and

918
00:46:59,915 --> 00:47:00,795
Speaker 7:  when to express yourself.

919
00:47:00,795 --> 00:47:02,035
Speaker 1:  Like, no, I just love the cure. Leave me alone.

920
00:47:03,105 --> 00:47:03,755
Speaker 7:  Like literally

921
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:05,395
Speaker 6:  Can I can't. And is why you don't want it on your phone.

922
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,515
Speaker 7:  I'm just trying to get, I'm trying to get to next door with this message

923
00:47:08,735 --> 00:47:09,475
Speaker 7:  and it didn't work.

924
00:47:09,825 --> 00:47:12,235
Speaker 1:  It's tough, man. I'm really sorry. Yeah. All right. What was the worst thing

925
00:47:12,235 --> 00:47:13,795
Speaker 1:  about PBM? What do you got?

926
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:18,955
Speaker 6:  I think that it, that it stalled and they didn't, they didn't bring

927
00:47:19,195 --> 00:47:20,195
Speaker 6:  it to other platforms.

928
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,325
Speaker 1:  I think. I agree. It's, it's, I mean,

929
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:27,045
Speaker 7:  Wait. No, no. It's the obvious insane

930
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:31,125
Speaker 7:  usability nightmare of the username is being random digits of numbers. Oh.

931
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:31,285
Speaker 7:  See

932
00:47:31,305 --> 00:47:31,805
Speaker 1:  I'm actually pro

933
00:47:32,035 --> 00:47:33,285
Speaker 6:  Pins. But you didn't have to do that.

934
00:47:34,415 --> 00:47:35,015
Speaker 7:  Everyone did it. Yeah,

935
00:47:35,215 --> 00:47:38,335
Speaker 6:  Everyone did it. Yeah. Because it was impossible to add another way. This

936
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:38,495
Speaker 6:  is

937
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,215
Speaker 1:  The worst. Yeah. They had like QR codes

938
00:47:40,215 --> 00:47:42,055
Speaker 6:  At the end. Like it was, lemme reformulate my argument.

939
00:47:44,155 --> 00:47:46,375
Speaker 6:  Yes. That was also on my list is one of the worst things. That's so fine.

940
00:47:46,495 --> 00:47:50,455
Speaker 1:  I don't agree. I think like a, a number that is, it was a QR code that QR

941
00:47:50,455 --> 00:47:53,295
Speaker 1:  codes your isn't your phone number is like a good and valuable thing. And

942
00:47:53,295 --> 00:47:55,575
Speaker 1:  the fact that all of our usernames are just our phone numbers, which are

943
00:47:55,575 --> 00:47:58,335
Speaker 1:  also like the most important piece of personal security. We have disaster.

944
00:47:58,565 --> 00:48:01,655
Speaker 1:  Sure. Give me more random numbers that I can give to people. Like I'm fine

945
00:48:01,655 --> 00:48:02,895
Speaker 1:  with it honestly. I

946
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:06,255
Speaker 7:  Just like, it's just like, this is so your ideas, you're gonna issue everybody

947
00:48:06,335 --> 00:48:09,255
Speaker 7:  a a nine digit number again. Okay. Go nuts, Jim.

948
00:48:09,715 --> 00:48:12,415
Speaker 1:  All right. Question number three. Would it have been a bigger hit if Apple

949
00:48:12,415 --> 00:48:13,215
Speaker 1:  made it? Well,

950
00:48:13,215 --> 00:48:13,575
Speaker 7:  It was.

951
00:48:13,995 --> 00:48:14,655
Speaker 6:  Yes. It's called

952
00:48:14,815 --> 00:48:16,855
Speaker 1:  Ess. Apple did do it and it wasn't much bigger hit

953
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:19,735
Speaker 7:  Wildly but more successful product. Yeah.

954
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:23,255
Speaker 1:  I mean, it, it is sort of funny actually because it's like it, you, apple

955
00:48:23,475 --> 00:48:25,135
Speaker 1:  did just do all the things that,

956
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:29,735
Speaker 7:  Oh, message is lost. I like, literally like in the halls of the

957
00:48:29,735 --> 00:48:33,295
Speaker 7:  theater, people are like, oh, Blackberry said now. Yeah. Like it's, it was

958
00:48:33,295 --> 00:48:36,375
Speaker 7:  like that. We, today we have witnessed a murder. Like that was the vibe at

959
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:36,775
Speaker 7:  that event.

960
00:48:36,965 --> 00:48:40,535
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. I think they're gonna, this is, this is one of my favorite questions

961
00:48:40,535 --> 00:48:43,095
Speaker 1:  there because there's some of times it's gonna be very complicated and sometimes

962
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:45,495
Speaker 1:  it's just, yes, apple did do it much better. Well,

963
00:48:45,495 --> 00:48:48,855
Speaker 7:  You, it's Apple has all the same problems, right? iCloud is centralized in

964
00:48:49,295 --> 00:48:53,135
Speaker 7:  countries like China. You can just unplug it. You can just go get the

965
00:48:53,135 --> 00:48:56,855
Speaker 7:  data. The FBI if you have iCloud backups of your iMessage, it's not Incr.

966
00:48:56,855 --> 00:49:00,335
Speaker 7:  Like all of the same stuff is in recapitulated now with iMessage and the

967
00:49:00,335 --> 00:49:01,455
Speaker 7:  exact same way as Blackberry

968
00:49:01,915 --> 00:49:05,865
Speaker 6:  And all of your arguments you've made about stickiness could be one of the

969
00:49:05,865 --> 00:49:07,385
Speaker 6:  last things that holds people. But

970
00:49:07,385 --> 00:49:10,225
Speaker 1:  I will say, like we, every time we talk about the stickiness of iMessage,

971
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:13,145
Speaker 1:  we get a bunch of use or a bunch of listeners from anywhere else in the

972
00:49:13,145 --> 00:49:14,265
Speaker 6:  World in the country I know who

973
00:49:14,265 --> 00:49:18,025
Speaker 1:  Are like, no one uses iMessage. It's just WhatsApp, WhatsApp one. And I think

974
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:20,065
Speaker 1:  that's largely true. And

975
00:49:20,065 --> 00:49:22,265
Speaker 7:  All of those countries have higher Android market share.

976
00:49:22,315 --> 00:49:25,105
Speaker 1:  Right? But there is clearly no question that it would've been a bigger hit

977
00:49:25,105 --> 00:49:28,585
Speaker 1:  if Apple made it because it did work super well. Question number four, if

978
00:49:28,585 --> 00:49:32,385
Speaker 1:  you could go back and do it yourself, what would you do differently? Joanna?

979
00:49:32,405 --> 00:49:36,265
Speaker 1:  I'm, I'm putting you in charge of BBM in 2008.

980
00:49:37,195 --> 00:49:39,445
Speaker 1:  Peak of its powers. BBM, what are you doing differently?

981
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:43,835
Speaker 6:  Same thing we've been talking about making it available to more phones, more

982
00:49:43,835 --> 00:49:47,435
Speaker 6:  cross platform. But to Eli's point, what about the rest of my hardware business?

983
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:48,915
Speaker 6:  And so, right. I

984
00:49:48,915 --> 00:49:49,155
Speaker 1:  Mean this is,

985
00:49:49,255 --> 00:49:49,715
Speaker 6:  Jim is crying.

986
00:49:49,785 --> 00:49:51,955
Speaker 1:  That was my original answer. But then I'm looking at it, I'm like, okay,

987
00:49:52,315 --> 00:49:55,275
Speaker 1:  actually the story of consumer messaging is that it's not a business at all.

988
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:59,115
Speaker 1:  There's no one has ever figured out how to rub two nickels together from

989
00:49:59,115 --> 00:50:02,155
Speaker 1:  letting people text each other. That's why if you're WhatsApp, you end up

990
00:50:02,155 --> 00:50:05,515
Speaker 1:  selling for a lot of money. It's what's killing Snapchat like over and over.

991
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:09,435
Speaker 1:  This is, there's just not a business here. And so that's, this is my

992
00:50:09,435 --> 00:50:12,355
Speaker 1:  problem too. I'm like, that is, from a product perspective, clearly the right

993
00:50:12,355 --> 00:50:14,955
Speaker 1:  answer. If you want, a lot of people use BBM, that's what you do. You put

994
00:50:14,955 --> 00:50:18,835
Speaker 1:  it everywhere much faster. But there's sort

995
00:50:18,835 --> 00:50:22,195
Speaker 1:  of no evidence to suggest that there was a company to support that.

996
00:50:22,515 --> 00:50:26,315
Speaker 6:  Right. I think any of my ideas are not actually about BBM. It's like

997
00:50:26,425 --> 00:50:27,565
Speaker 6:  ways to save Blackberry.

998
00:50:27,585 --> 00:50:28,805
Speaker 7:  Yes. How would you have saved Blackberry

999
00:50:30,315 --> 00:50:30,605
Speaker 6:  Beds?

1000
00:50:31,345 --> 00:50:31,925
Speaker 7:  The beds.

1001
00:50:33,485 --> 00:50:34,165
Speaker 7:  I mean that's, but

1002
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:36,645
Speaker 6:  Maybe like, maybe I would've made a cloud business.

1003
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:41,055
Speaker 7:  You, you can, you can't just say that no one, what's the, what is the cloud?

1004
00:50:41,565 --> 00:50:43,735
Speaker 6:  Well, this, this is before the cloud. Like this is, oh, you

1005
00:50:43,735 --> 00:50:46,455
Speaker 7:  Mean you would've done like a, a desktop messaging in the cloud

1006
00:50:46,735 --> 00:50:47,295
Speaker 6:  Situation or maybe,

1007
00:50:48,805 --> 00:50:52,715
Speaker 6:  I don't know, maybe it's better email or like the company was

1008
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:56,035
Speaker 6:  an email company and like, this is around the time Gmail blows up. I mean,

1009
00:50:56,065 --> 00:50:59,995
Speaker 6:  there's a lot of cloud infrastructure that the company had

1010
00:51:00,005 --> 00:51:02,235
Speaker 6:  ideas about. And it could have made, I don't know,

1011
00:51:02,575 --> 00:51:05,835
Speaker 1:  You just said my answer, which is I would've fed it to Gmail. It's like,

1012
00:51:06,185 --> 00:51:10,115
Speaker 1:  love actually actually shoved the two company together. But like the

1013
00:51:10,115 --> 00:51:13,315
Speaker 1:  thing, part of the thing that Gmail did so successfully was they put Gchat

1014
00:51:13,315 --> 00:51:16,395
Speaker 1:  into Gmail. And that, that connection became a huge thing, became really,

1015
00:51:16,395 --> 00:51:19,435
Speaker 1:  really, really powerful. And if, if

1016
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:23,475
Speaker 1:  Blackberry had built those two things together and then

1017
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:27,075
Speaker 1:  put it everywhere, then it's a thing you can charge people money to use for

1018
00:51:27,075 --> 00:51:30,395
Speaker 1:  work. It becomes like, you, you put email back into it and there starts to

1019
00:51:30,395 --> 00:51:33,475
Speaker 1:  be more of a business case there that I would've been very into.

1020
00:51:33,695 --> 00:51:35,915
Speaker 6:  You love emails. My favorite, you have a t-shirt that says

1021
00:51:35,915 --> 00:51:37,835
Speaker 7:  Emails. It's my favorite. It's, they're the, they're the, again, nations

1022
00:51:37,835 --> 00:51:41,815
Speaker 7:  rise and fall. But I'm, I, what I would say, not to

1023
00:51:41,815 --> 00:51:45,655
Speaker 7:  be a downer, there was no saving this company at

1024
00:51:45,675 --> 00:51:49,095
Speaker 7:  its DNA level. This is a company that is built around constraints.

1025
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:54,015
Speaker 7:  Slow processors, weak batteries, slow

1026
00:51:54,015 --> 00:51:57,655
Speaker 7:  networks constrained storage per email. And the reason

1027
00:51:57,745 --> 00:52:00,975
Speaker 7:  Gmail existed where they're like, well, storage is free, here's unlimited

1028
00:52:00,975 --> 00:52:04,055
Speaker 7:  storage, right? Like, here's a gigabyte of email storage. And everyone thought

1029
00:52:04,055 --> 00:52:07,855
Speaker 7:  that was fake. Apple is like, it's a huge touch screen that can

1030
00:52:07,855 --> 00:52:11,335
Speaker 7:  run apps in full color. And everyone was like, that battery will never last.

1031
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:15,615
Speaker 7:  And Blackberry, at its core was optimized around limits

1032
00:52:16,155 --> 00:52:19,535
Speaker 7:  and scarcity of like resource, like literally the resources, network,

1033
00:52:19,805 --> 00:52:23,735
Speaker 7:  bandwidth, memory, whatever. It's, and I don't think they

1034
00:52:23,735 --> 00:52:27,375
Speaker 7:  could have fixed it. 'cause they needed to embrace the, the new era, which

1035
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:30,935
Speaker 7:  was about, oh, everything has gotten much faster and more powerful. Even

1036
00:52:31,165 --> 00:52:34,615
Speaker 7:  like the first iPhone was not built for the network. It was on, remember

1037
00:52:34,615 --> 00:52:38,255
Speaker 7:  it was a two G phone. They didn't have 3G for another year. And they were

1038
00:52:38,415 --> 00:52:42,055
Speaker 7:  still like, screw it webpage. And like they, they were

1039
00:52:42,055 --> 00:52:45,935
Speaker 7:  betting on a curve that Blackberry was betting against. And I

1040
00:52:45,935 --> 00:52:49,375
Speaker 7:  don't know that they could have flipped it. Like, the thing I'm saying is

1041
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,015
Speaker 7:  like, I would've fixed it by making it a totally different company with a

1042
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:54,935
Speaker 7:  different attitude. And I don't know that, that, I think that sometimes companies

1043
00:52:54,935 --> 00:52:58,755
Speaker 7:  just missed the moment and like Blackberry is like the story

1044
00:52:58,775 --> 00:52:59,475
Speaker 7:  of that. Really.

1045
00:52:59,695 --> 00:53:00,435
Speaker 1:  So you would've sold

1046
00:53:01,075 --> 00:53:03,835
Speaker 7:  I would've, yeah. I would've gone to Apple and been like, your future is

1047
00:53:03,835 --> 00:53:07,515
Speaker 7:  the Fortune 500. Yeah. It very clearly was these BY

1048
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:11,835
Speaker 7:  od policies bringing in advice. Policies are the future. Like here's our

1049
00:53:11,835 --> 00:53:12,195
Speaker 7:  infrastructure.

1050
00:53:12,305 --> 00:53:14,515
Speaker 1:  Yeah. We've built a bunch of really interesting technology. You can have

1051
00:53:14,515 --> 00:53:16,115
Speaker 1:  it. I'm gonna go buy a boat.

1052
00:53:16,145 --> 00:53:19,115
Speaker 7:  Yeah. You're in a, you're in a, you're about to be in a dog fight with Microsoft,

1053
00:53:19,205 --> 00:53:22,475
Speaker 7:  which they were Yeah. To, to a huge extent. Like here, just take that.

1054
00:53:22,935 --> 00:53:23,235
Speaker 1:  All right.

1055
00:53:23,675 --> 00:53:26,125
Speaker 7:  They would, by the way, Blackberry would've never done this. No.

1056
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:29,245
Speaker 1:  Gosh, no. No. But maybe they should have. And then they could

1057
00:53:29,245 --> 00:53:31,805
Speaker 6:  Have walked and talk about the constraints. Like that's what they ended up

1058
00:53:31,995 --> 00:53:35,085
Speaker 6:  like the last five years is them being in

1059
00:53:35,775 --> 00:53:39,285
Speaker 6:  developing countries and developing world because they didn't have the network.

1060
00:53:39,285 --> 00:53:39,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That's where that

1061
00:53:39,725 --> 00:53:43,645
Speaker 7:  Exists in every car. Right. It's because every car maker under

1062
00:53:43,655 --> 00:53:47,285
Speaker 7:  specs, the processor and the memory and the, the compute of the car, and

1063
00:53:47,285 --> 00:53:49,685
Speaker 7:  they don't wanna pay for a lot of data. Makes sense. So they're like sense

1064
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:53,325
Speaker 7:  What's the, what's the operating system we can run that's like for shitty

1065
00:53:53,325 --> 00:53:56,725
Speaker 7:  phones? Because basically there's a shitty phone behind the screen of your

1066
00:53:56,725 --> 00:53:56,845
Speaker 7:  car.

1067
00:53:56,845 --> 00:53:59,045
Speaker 1:  Right? Yeah. And if you put yourself in a position of always chasing the

1068
00:53:59,045 --> 00:54:02,925
Speaker 1:  worst chip Yep. That gets pretty ugly for you. Pretty fast. Yeah. All right.

1069
00:54:02,925 --> 00:54:06,845
Speaker 1:  Next question. What feature of BBM should every current

1070
00:54:06,845 --> 00:54:10,165
Speaker 1:  messaging app have? If you could just lift one and put it in

1071
00:54:11,005 --> 00:54:11,845
Speaker 6:  A messages

1072
00:54:12,055 --> 00:54:15,885
Speaker 7:  50 songs for $5 a month. It's, it's obviously way

1073
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:16,285
Speaker 7:  messages.

1074
00:54:16,765 --> 00:54:20,605
Speaker 1:  I think that's right. There is some, I there is like a version of the like

1075
00:54:21,015 --> 00:54:24,685
Speaker 1:  music sharing thing that I can like almost see that would work. But you'd

1076
00:54:24,685 --> 00:54:26,845
Speaker 1:  have to change it completely. I think. I think we're, we're all in agreement

1077
00:54:26,845 --> 00:54:27,845
Speaker 1:  with the answer's. The way message is,

1078
00:54:28,085 --> 00:54:32,055
Speaker 6:  I think Apple does it, is it share play basically that you

1079
00:54:32,055 --> 00:54:32,975
Speaker 6:  don't pay for it. You have

1080
00:54:33,275 --> 00:54:35,695
Speaker 7:  No Apple try to share, use Ping and it Oh,

1081
00:54:35,695 --> 00:54:35,855
Speaker 6:  You have

1082
00:54:36,255 --> 00:54:37,175
Speaker 1:  A huge, that's right.

1083
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:39,855
Speaker 6:  No, I don't use the social Yeah.

1084
00:54:39,855 --> 00:54:43,015
Speaker 1:  No. Apple Music nightmare stuff. I, I I learned a while ago that you can

1085
00:54:43,015 --> 00:54:46,215
Speaker 1:  use share play to have the same music on two headphones. It's a disaster.

1086
00:54:46,315 --> 00:54:49,455
Speaker 1:  No one should try it. Question number six, is there an alternate timeline

1087
00:54:49,455 --> 00:54:53,375
Speaker 1:  in which this thing was more or even more successful? And I think in

1088
00:54:53,375 --> 00:54:57,215
Speaker 1:  this case, it's what if the iPhone doesn't exist? If the

1089
00:54:57,215 --> 00:55:01,095
Speaker 1:  iPhone ships in 2012 and not 2007 is the

1090
00:55:01,095 --> 00:55:02,455
Speaker 1:  story of BM completely different.

1091
00:55:03,185 --> 00:55:06,355
Speaker 7:  There's an alternate world in which BBM is more successful if they didn't

1092
00:55:06,355 --> 00:55:09,795
Speaker 7:  fumble the bag and they just put it on smartphones,

1093
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:13,955
Speaker 7:  like proper smartphones, right? That and then BM becomes this like messaging

1094
00:55:13,955 --> 00:55:17,555
Speaker 7:  layer. But everyone else made the same mistake. Like AOL Instant Messenger

1095
00:55:17,775 --> 00:55:21,315
Speaker 7:  did not have a proper app on these phones. Google, right? Was like, man,

1096
00:55:21,555 --> 00:55:25,235
Speaker 7:  everyone loves Gchat. It's not even called Gchat. Like it's,

1097
00:55:25,465 --> 00:55:26,315
Speaker 1:  It's called Google Talk.

1098
00:55:26,905 --> 00:55:27,195
Speaker 7:  What?

1099
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:28,915
Speaker 6:  At some point it was called

1100
00:55:29,165 --> 00:55:30,035
Speaker 7:  Gchat. No, never was

1101
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,235
Speaker 1:  Never. Gchat is like full on.

1102
00:55:31,335 --> 00:55:32,555
Speaker 6:  We made it. Yeah. Okay.

1103
00:55:32,555 --> 00:55:33,995
Speaker 1:  Yeah. That has been red. It

1104
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:38,355
Speaker 7:  Bears messaging clients and they just never put the proper app on

1105
00:55:38,355 --> 00:55:41,555
Speaker 7:  a phone. Like everyone looked at these phones and thought, well we just won't

1106
00:55:41,555 --> 00:55:45,275
Speaker 7:  put an app there until some people were like, we are

1107
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,355
Speaker 7:  billionaires. 'cause we put an

1108
00:55:46,355 --> 00:55:47,035
Speaker 1:  App there. Yeah.

1109
00:55:47,795 --> 00:55:48,035
Speaker 6:  WhatsApp.

1110
00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:51,795
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. All right. Question number seven. Could you reboot it now?

1111
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:55,995
Speaker 1:  And I think the simple messaging app question, the answer is no.

1112
00:55:56,005 --> 00:55:58,115
Speaker 1:  Right? Like, are we all in basic agreement on that?

1113
00:56:01,955 --> 00:56:03,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I think that's pretty tough now.

1114
00:56:04,045 --> 00:56:07,525
Speaker 6:  I mean, maybe for like me, just do it. Just give

1115
00:56:07,585 --> 00:56:09,125
Speaker 1:  Joanna her pin back and it'll be okay.

1116
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:13,165
Speaker 6:  I did have a t-shirt and I tried to find it for this taping, but it said

1117
00:56:13,525 --> 00:56:17,405
Speaker 6:  bb m me and this was like a t-shirt. They like were giving out at

1118
00:56:17,405 --> 00:56:20,965
Speaker 6:  Sure. When those phones launched. 'cause they were still trying. Yeah.

1119
00:56:21,365 --> 00:56:23,405
Speaker 6:  B, BM and then E at the end.

1120
00:56:24,295 --> 00:56:27,935
Speaker 1:  I love it. What about the like biggest,

1121
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:32,015
Speaker 1:  most ambitious like super appy version of the thing? No one has yet built

1122
00:56:32,015 --> 00:56:32,495
Speaker 1:  that thing

1123
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,585
Speaker 7:  Because Apple won't let you in this country.

1124
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:36,915
Speaker 1:  True.

1125
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:41,415
Speaker 7:  Like just straightforwardly, you're, you're fighting against a set of

1126
00:56:41,615 --> 00:56:44,015
Speaker 7:  platform policies that prevent the thing from existing.

1127
00:56:44,045 --> 00:56:47,695
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And that's true everywhere at this point. There's no, you just can't

1128
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:48,335
Speaker 1:  win that game.

1129
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:51,335
Speaker 7:  Yeah. You're not gonna roll into China and be like WeChat now,

1130
00:56:51,335 --> 00:56:51,815
Speaker 1:  Right? Yeah.

1131
00:56:52,195 --> 00:56:54,895
Speaker 7:  Try. Have you heard of WeChat? Have you tried this one? Do you,

1132
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,035
Speaker 1:  Do you disagree? Could you reboot it now?

1133
00:56:57,755 --> 00:57:01,295
Speaker 6:  I mean, I think the everything app idea is harder in the US

1134
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:04,615
Speaker 6:  because of the stickiness of all these other services that we're kind of

1135
00:57:04,615 --> 00:57:08,375
Speaker 6:  used to using. So maybe there's a way where they like,

1136
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:11,495
Speaker 6:  like plug it. No, it's just like too complicated. The only, like, why would

1137
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:12,215
Speaker 6:  we all go? The

1138
00:57:12,215 --> 00:57:16,055
Speaker 1:  Only case I've been able to make for it is maybe the, the

1139
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:19,775
Speaker 1:  meta ness of WhatsApp is becoming a problem for

1140
00:57:19,855 --> 00:57:23,695
Speaker 1:  enough people that they would jump to something else. But I don't, I don't

1141
00:57:23,695 --> 00:57:26,455
Speaker 1:  know. There's too many options right now. It feels like that's, it just feels

1142
00:57:26,455 --> 00:57:29,295
Speaker 1:  like a losing battle to try to start a messaging app from nothing. I do think

1143
00:57:29,295 --> 00:57:31,895
Speaker 1:  we've come, even if, I do think people have a lot of nostalgia for BBM.

1144
00:57:31,955 --> 00:57:35,935
Speaker 6:  And I do think we've come a lot farther in our acceptance of using multiple

1145
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:39,655
Speaker 6:  messaging apps, right? Like, we'll use Signal, we'll use WhatsApp, we'll

1146
00:57:39,655 --> 00:57:43,015
Speaker 6:  use iMessage. True. We'll use Gchat, whatever it's called these days.

1147
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:47,695
Speaker 6:  But I feel like this idea of, at least in the US it's always been very

1148
00:57:47,695 --> 00:57:50,815
Speaker 6:  hard for people to grasp, I'm gonna need to do all these things in this app

1149
00:57:51,345 --> 00:57:55,155
Speaker 6:  because I like Venmo or I like the Cash app, or I like this music app. Or

1150
00:57:55,175 --> 00:57:57,495
Speaker 6:  at least, yeah, I don't know.

1151
00:57:58,135 --> 00:58:01,725
Speaker 7:  I mean, the argument against interoperability for all those apps take it

1152
00:58:01,725 --> 00:58:04,365
Speaker 7:  for what it's worth is like, well, they're all on your phone, right? You

1153
00:58:04,365 --> 00:58:07,245
Speaker 7:  just close one and open the other. Like you there, there, there they are.

1154
00:58:07,265 --> 00:58:09,725
Speaker 7:  You don't have to worry about it. I think there's some downsides to that.

1155
00:58:09,725 --> 00:58:13,605
Speaker 7:  Like I don't think wanting one feature should make you leave the

1156
00:58:13,605 --> 00:58:17,325
Speaker 7:  entire platform and that your whole network of friends, like that's

1157
00:58:17,325 --> 00:58:21,245
Speaker 7:  basically how they compete now. But I I would say instead of trying to

1158
00:58:21,245 --> 00:58:24,605
Speaker 7:  make it bigger, you wanna make it smaller. Or if you were to try to relaunch

1159
00:58:24,645 --> 00:58:27,365
Speaker 7:  PBM, you, I don't know, you would be like, here's a messaging app that's

1160
00:58:27,365 --> 00:58:30,445
Speaker 7:  just for families and kids. Mm. And we're gonna make sure it's safe. Like

1161
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:34,445
Speaker 7:  you, your kids want to text their friends like, we're gonna, this one will

1162
00:58:34,445 --> 00:58:37,205
Speaker 7:  be locked down. And there are some that compete like that. But you've got,

1163
00:58:37,205 --> 00:58:39,685
Speaker 7:  you don't have like the big Blackberry brand name and all this, the stuff.

1164
00:58:40,305 --> 00:58:43,325
Speaker 7:  And like that's, I I think this solution here is smaller, not bigger.

1165
00:58:43,905 --> 00:58:47,365
Speaker 1:  All right. I like it. All right. And then last question. Does BBM belong

1166

1172
00:58:58,585 --> 00:59:01,035
Speaker 7:  Only so many people get in like the NFL Hall of Fame every year.

1173
00:59:01,725 --> 00:59:02,085
Speaker 1:  I don't think

1174
00:59:02,085 --> 00:59:04,045
Speaker 7:  There are like, and there's like a voting process. There is a voting process.

1175
00:59:04,045 --> 00:59:06,565
Speaker 7:  Some people don't make it every year after year. That's where the tension

1176
00:59:06,575 --> 00:59:10,125
Speaker 7:  comes from. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Do you have a silent, the same

1177
00:59:10,395 --> 00:59:12,285
Speaker 6:  Judging process? Do we know?

1178
00:59:12,825 --> 00:59:15,605
Speaker 1:  I'm saying just vibes All Hall of Fame are just vibes. Okay. So that's what

1179
00:59:15,605 --> 00:59:16,125
Speaker 1:  we're doing here. Well you,

1180
00:59:16,245 --> 00:59:18,565
Speaker 6:  I think something Blackberry belongs in there don't know if,

1181
00:59:19,065 --> 00:59:22,765
Speaker 7:  And that is the argument you make for like, not including like a sports player.

1182
00:59:23,205 --> 00:59:25,525
Speaker 7:  Right? Right. You're like a picture. It's someone from we should get a your

1183

Speaker 1:  Right.

1185
00:59:27,165 --> 00:59:30,605
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Understood. So I'm saying not knowing any of the qualifications except

1186
00:59:30,905 --> 00:59:34,725
Speaker 7:  the one thing I know of Hall of Fame is only you can't be every

1187

Speaker 7:  episode is yes. Right. Agreed. We

1188
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:40,585

1189
00:59:40,605 --> 00:59:43,665
