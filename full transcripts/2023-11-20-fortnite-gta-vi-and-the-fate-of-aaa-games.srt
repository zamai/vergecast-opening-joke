Speaker 4:  Welcome To. The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of DLCs. I'm your friend,

12
00:00:44,175 --> 00:00:48,055
Speaker 4:  David Pierce. And this is the third and final episode in our miniseries about

13
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:51,855
Speaker 4:  the future of gaming. We've talked about handheld gaming and why consoles

14
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:54,535
Speaker 4:  like the Switch and the Steam deck might just be the future of everything.

15
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:58,535
Speaker 4:  We've talked about how to emulate and preserve old games

16
00:00:58,635 --> 00:01:02,055
Speaker 4:  and why that matters in a really important way. And today we're gonna talk

17
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:05,855
Speaker 4:  about big games, the biggest games, games like Fortnite and

18
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:09,655
Speaker 4:  Call of Duty and Roblox and Madden and Assassin's

19
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:13,535
Speaker 4:  Creed. The kinds of games that even people who don't care about games know

20
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:17,335
Speaker 4:  about. These games are so culturally important and

21
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:21,655
Speaker 4:  economically outrageous that it often feels like as

22
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:25,535
Speaker 4:  those games go, so goes the whole gaming industry. But those

23
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:28,335
Speaker 4:  games are changing. The way that they get made is changing. The way that

24
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:31,695
Speaker 4:  they get sold is changing. Everything about them is changing. So we're gonna

25
00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:35,615
Speaker 4:  try to figure out today what happens to the biggest games and

26
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:39,495
Speaker 4:  what it means for all the rest of the games and for us who play them. My

27
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:42,535
Speaker 4:  colleagues from Polygon, Chris Plant and Russ Frushtick are back with me.

28
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,415
Speaker 4:  The way this is gonna work is we're gonna talk it out a little bit and then

29
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:48,655
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna go do some research, talk to some people and then present them

30
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,735
Speaker 4:  with what I've discovered and see if I've learned anything at all. Also,

31
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:55,455
Speaker 4:  before we get into it, I just wanna say we've had this crazy run of

32
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:58,895
Speaker 4:  miniseries over the last few months. I know it's been a lot of

33
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:02,935
Speaker 4:  Vergecast and I'm so grateful to all of you who have listened to all these

34
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:06,775
Speaker 4:  episodes and gone with me and us on these weird adventures into

35
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:10,375
Speaker 4:  AI and connectivity and gaming. We've had a ton of fun making these

36
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:14,295
Speaker 4:  episodes. I know it's been a lot. The. Vergecast Feed is gonna go mostly

37
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:18,095
Speaker 4:  back to normal now, but seriously, thank you to everyone who has sent nice

38
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:21,655
Speaker 4:  emails, who has called in with thoughts on the hotline. We're very grateful.

39
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:25,655
Speaker 4:  It's been incredibly fun. With that, let's just get into it. Russ and Chris

40
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:26,655
Speaker 4:  are here. Here we go.

41
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:32,335
Speaker 4:  Chris, plant Welcome back. Hey, thank you. Russ Frushtick, Welcome back.

42
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:36,055
Speaker 4:  Thank you. Thank you. This is the third of our three episodes. It's been

43
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:39,615
Speaker 4:  very fun so far. I have learned an enormous amount about the gaming world

44
00:02:39,615 --> 00:02:43,095
Speaker 4:  that I did not know already. And for this episode, we've kind of

45
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,775
Speaker 4:  noodled around like the edges of what is coming for gaming

46
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:50,695
Speaker 4:  in the last two episodes. But this time we're gonna talk about like the

47
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:54,575
Speaker 4:  biggest games and game makers on planet

48
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:58,375
Speaker 4:  Earth because we've gone through this huge transition in so much

49
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:02,085
Speaker 4:  of entertainment, whether it's the way that we consume music or the way that

50
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:05,845
Speaker 4:  we consume TV and how Netflix changed the whole business of how

51
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:09,805
Speaker 4:  television and movies get made and all that stuff. And what you guys have

52
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:13,405
Speaker 4:  told me sort of in the planning process for this is that gaming is in the

53
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:17,045
Speaker 4:  middle or at the beginning of a similar transition. That the way

54
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:21,125
Speaker 4:  we think about what games are and how we buy them and the biggest

55
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:24,805
Speaker 4:  names of all of them is set to shift and shift fairly

56
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:28,405
Speaker 4:  quickly. Is Russ, you're nodding? Is that a fair way of thinking about it?

57
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:32,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah, absolutely. We're already seeing it. The rise of the subscription

58
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:36,205
Speaker 5:  model for game ownership with the rise of something

59
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:40,005
Speaker 5:  like Game Pass means that you can pay your $15 a month,

60
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:44,125
Speaker 5:  whatever it is for a ton of games and

61
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:48,165
Speaker 5:  you don't actually end up buying any physical games. You end up

62
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:52,125
Speaker 5:  just like kind of renting them in a way through these services. And this

63
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,885
Speaker 5:  has already been a huge priority for companies like

64
00:03:56,165 --> 00:03:59,765
Speaker 5:  Microsoft. And you're gonna see it continue to increase over time.

65
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:02,805
Speaker 4:  I'm just sort of trying to think this through and like I think one of the

66
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:06,645
Speaker 4:  things that's happened in Hollywood is basically the whole middle fell

67
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:09,765
Speaker 4:  out, right? You can either make a giant, like a Avenger style blockbuster

68
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:14,445
Speaker 4:  or you can make a relatively small budget thing or you can make a TV

69
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:17,125
Speaker 4:  show, right? Like we've, we've figured out how to do sort of prestige tv.

70
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:21,125
Speaker 4:  But if you are in the business of making like event movies, which I would

71
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,445
Speaker 4:  say is probably the closest thing to AAA game in that space.

72
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah, sure. Like a Marvel, big Marvel movie. Yeah.

73
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:29,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's not a perfect analogy, but it's close enough. There is nothing

74
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:33,445
Speaker 4:  in the middle anymore. You either have to spend very little and hope or

75
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:37,405
Speaker 4:  spend a gigantic amount of money on super safe IP and that's all

76
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:39,525
Speaker 4:  that's left. Is that where we're headed in video games too,

77
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:43,925
Speaker 6:  Kind of though with maybe a, an adjustment to like the framing of the middle.

78
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:48,045
Speaker 6:  There's a lot of middle now. We just don't watch it there. There's

79
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:51,725
Speaker 6:  like so much middle, there's You know Netflix has a

80
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:55,965
Speaker 6:  gajillion middle productions and they come out every week and they don't

81
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:59,565
Speaker 6:  even market them and they, they're not

82
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:03,365
Speaker 6:  particularly good. And it used to be that you like would go to a movie

83
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:06,765
Speaker 6:  theater and people had to put effort into the middle and now the middle is

84
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:07,885
Speaker 6:  just like filler.

85
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:11,525
Speaker 4:  You could like make a cultural moment out of the middle in the past. And

86
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,685
Speaker 4:  I think that is long gone in Hollywood.

87
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:17,805
Speaker 5:  Yes. On the gaming side, the middle used to be the like

88
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:22,045
Speaker 5:  10 to $20 million game that took, let's say three years

89
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:25,965
Speaker 5:  to make and came out and did pretty well. And Activision

90
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:29,285
Speaker 5:  would put out a bunch of those. EA would put out a bunch of those. And what

91
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:32,805
Speaker 5:  you're seeing is these big studios because of the ex rising

92
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:36,845
Speaker 5:  expenses of game making at that level, yeah they are unwilling

93
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:40,885
Speaker 5:  to do those smaller investments because they're really sinking hundreds of

94
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:44,125
Speaker 5:  millions of dollars into the big franchises, the Diablos of the world, the

95
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:48,285
Speaker 5:  GTAs of the world, and they just can't afford to focus

96
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:52,285
Speaker 5:  on those small potential wins. 'cause the losses can be huge

97
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:56,165
Speaker 5:  even for those like mid range titles. So what you're seeing is, yeah,

98
00:05:56,225 --> 00:06:00,165
Speaker 5:  the AAA and that's paired with the like indie world, which

99
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:04,085
Speaker 5:  can obviously be very low budget up to let's say two and

100
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:08,005
Speaker 5:  $3 million games. Which honestly these days is small in the way

101
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:11,325
Speaker 5:  that like an indie movie at two and $3 million is small. But

102
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:15,085
Speaker 4:  Then at the same time, it also seems like some of these companies that make

103
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:18,925
Speaker 4:  these huge AAA games are making fewer of them.

104
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:22,565
Speaker 4:  Like I, I feel like, and I can't prove this, maybe you guys would definitely

105
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:25,845
Speaker 4:  know better than I would, but I feel like the, the number of like big name

106
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:29,765
Speaker 4:  games that I've never heard of goes down every year. Yeah. That

107
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,845
Speaker 4:  it's, it's all games that I've been hearing about forever. It's all Assassin's

108
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:36,445
Speaker 4:  Creed, like EA just keeps running back the same six sports games. It does

109
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:40,205
Speaker 4:  every year. There's like a, there's a something three and a something four

110
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:43,165
Speaker 4:  and a something 11 that comes out every year. But I don't feel like there

111
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:47,085
Speaker 4:  are that many truly new things coming out

112
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:49,485
Speaker 4:  of these giant studios anymore. Is that true? Yeah,

113
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:53,645
Speaker 6:  I, I think that this and to connect us to the middle, this

114
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:57,645
Speaker 6:  happened actually before streaming and this is the what the Call of

115
00:06:57,645 --> 00:07:01,565
Speaker 6:  Duty Mass effect Madden era did to AAA

116
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:06,245
Speaker 6:  is You know when Fresh and I were starting and covering video games,

117
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:10,405
Speaker 6:  it wasn't unusual for Yu Bsof to try

118
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:13,885
Speaker 6:  a few different random things. You know they had, there was a time where

119
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:17,645
Speaker 6:  you had a new driver game and it played like Google Maps

120
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:21,605
Speaker 6:  meets racing or a new Sean White skateboarding game where

121
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:25,565
Speaker 6:  you could create rails out of like Green Goo and

122
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:28,565
Speaker 6:  they're just like, yeah, let's, let's put a mid-budget game and try it and

123
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:32,285
Speaker 6:  see where it goes. Along with all the license games, when

124
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,005
Speaker 6:  Call of Duty blew up Activision it felt like

125
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:40,205
Speaker 6:  had to basically shift all of its resources behind this

126
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:43,885
Speaker 6:  big bet. And they had that with Guitar Hero and they had that with Tony Hawk

127
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:47,845
Speaker 6:  all around kind of the same time. And as a result, everything else just,

128
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:51,885
Speaker 6:  there just weren't enough warm bodies to make the other stuff that's

129
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:55,645
Speaker 6:  at least how it felt You know if they wanted to get annual releases. So they

130
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:59,525
Speaker 6:  kind of created their bed and now they're having to sleep in it.

131
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:02,885
Speaker 6:  Is that, is that the metaphor? Is that the phrase? I think so, yeah. They

132
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:06,565
Speaker 6:  are now having to stick to these things because they're making

133
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:10,485
Speaker 6:  enough money that they can't stop doing it. But not so much that they can

134
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:14,285
Speaker 6:  like go and focus elsewhere. The other pickle that they have

135
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:18,845
Speaker 6:  is now with streaming and with some of these indie developers becoming indie

136
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:22,085
Speaker 6:  publishers and being able to like create more of these mid-budget games

137
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:26,565
Speaker 6:  is the general quality of video games right now is just very

138
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:30,365
Speaker 6:  high. So their fear is we have two games

139
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:34,405
Speaker 6:  out of the year we really need them to hit because they're gonna be

140
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:38,085
Speaker 6:  competing against hundreds. And once they do hit, we need to lock people

141
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:42,125
Speaker 6:  in. And that has just created this like bad bet after

142
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:45,365
Speaker 6:  bad bet they're, they're, they're making things harder and harder and harder

143
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,565
Speaker 6:  for themselves rather than looking at the industry and saying,

144
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:52,925
Speaker 6:  Hey, why don't we just do the thing that we're running from, we actually

145
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:56,605
Speaker 6:  are quite powerful. Why are we not putting out 20 or 30 games

146
00:08:56,845 --> 00:09:00,565
Speaker 6:  a year? Why Devolver the indie publisher is out there

147
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:04,845
Speaker 6:  and just wasn't acquired at any point is confusing to say

148
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:05,125
Speaker 6:  the least.

149
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:09,445
Speaker 4:  Interesting. Okay. Is there a new generation of these like upstart companies

150
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:13,125
Speaker 4:  trying to do that? Like normally the way you would think it would work, right?

151
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:16,765
Speaker 4:  As these, these big companies get settled into their sort of small handful

152
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:19,685
Speaker 4:  of franchises like you're describing and then outta that comes a bunch of

153
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,125
Speaker 4:  new companies saying we have new ideas, we can build games faster, we have

154
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,405
Speaker 4:  new ways of doing it. We don't have all this tech debt, we don't have massive

155
00:09:25,885 --> 00:09:29,165
Speaker 4:  companies we have to support, we can build the next thing. Is that

156
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:29,885
Speaker 4:  happening?

157
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:34,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think it's happening. You know Plant mentioned Devolver,

158
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:37,845
Speaker 5:  which is one of the biggest indie studios publishing

159
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:41,645
Speaker 5:  studios in there. And I think all of that work that they

160
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:45,525
Speaker 5:  have is really talent acquisition. They go out, they see,

161
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:49,325
Speaker 5:  oh, here's this small indie developer that's basically been doing it solo

162
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:53,005
Speaker 5:  or with a team of three people or whatever. We're gonna give them that two

163
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:56,885
Speaker 5:  and $3 million budget and we like what they're doing so we're

164
00:09:56,885 --> 00:10:00,765
Speaker 5:  gonna elevate that. And it becomes a decent sized hit. Like a death store

165
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:04,725
Speaker 5:  for example was an indie game that came out last year and and did pretty

166
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:08,525
Speaker 5:  well. So they are kind of curating that stuff. But because

167
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:12,325
Speaker 5:  of the nature of the expense of larger

168
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:16,365
Speaker 5:  game publishers having to make these big games, they can't

169
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:20,445
Speaker 5:  do that. Like EA can't be doing that. So they are focused instead

170
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:23,885
Speaker 5:  on the battlefields of the world and and their big franchises. So there is

171
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:27,765
Speaker 5:  this, this divide in terms of creating new ideas and

172
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:29,765
Speaker 5:  almost all of them are coming from the indie side.

173
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:33,685
Speaker 6:  You also mentioned the tech data of it all in the past being a big

174
00:10:33,685 --> 00:10:37,325
Speaker 6:  publisher benefited from the fact that you had an internal engine like

175
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:41,645
Speaker 6:  EA had the frostbite engine or I think Ubisoft had, anvil was one they

176
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:44,485
Speaker 6:  used for a while I believe or don don't know.

177
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:49,085
Speaker 6:  One. Those engines just are often more frustrating than

178
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:52,925
Speaker 6:  Unreal or Unity or any of the indie

179
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:57,085
Speaker 6:  engines. So you have that like so much for it being You

180
00:10:57,085 --> 00:11:00,045
Speaker 6:  know, like losing tech, you're, you're actually frustrated. You know you're

181
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:02,805
Speaker 6:  bringing on people who have to learn your new thing. Sure. And then two,

182
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:06,805
Speaker 6:  you're competing with people who have access to Unreal

183
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:10,725
Speaker 6:  and are perfectly fine using it. And when they go

184
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:13,885
Speaker 6:  out and hire people to work on it, people already know how to use those engines.

185
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:17,445
Speaker 6:  So it's all kind of inverted. It's actually just easier

186
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:22,245
Speaker 6:  for these these smaller and to mid-sized developers to work

187
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:25,805
Speaker 6:  because they're not married to all these kind of massive corporate

188
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:29,885
Speaker 6:  decisions that sound like they're money saves on paper but are

189
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:32,085
Speaker 6:  not actually beneficial to the people making the games.

190
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:36,605
Speaker 4:  Okay. Yeah. I later in this episode we're gonna do a bunch of 20, 24

191
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:39,605
Speaker 4:  predictions about kind of where all this is going. 'cause it does seem like

192
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:43,765
Speaker 4:  there are a bunch of things in other industries you can look at to see how

193
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:47,365
Speaker 4:  this might change. But also gaming we've learned is different in a lot of

194
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:50,525
Speaker 4:  ways and I think we're, we're gonna talk to some smart people but also just

195
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:52,645
Speaker 4:  spend some time the three of us trying to figure out where all this is going.

196
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:57,005
Speaker 4:  But before I run off and chase down some smart people about where we're going,

197
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:01,045
Speaker 4:  Chris, I want you to tell me why you wrote GTA six

198
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:03,165
Speaker 4:  in our Google Doc in large letters.

199
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:07,565
Speaker 6:  Yes. So this is the big question. This is the, the huge question I have for

200
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:11,245
Speaker 6:  you is GTA six gonna be the last mega

201
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,925
Speaker 6:  game. And I'm not talking about even AAA, I'm talking about

202
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:18,805
Speaker 6:  quadruple a i I we get You know one of these a year

203
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:22,965
Speaker 6:  maybe sort of games. And yet the big publishers

204
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:26,445
Speaker 6:  can't help themselves from continuing to chase these dreams.

205
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:31,125
Speaker 6:  And I wonder if GTA six we will see a change after that

206
00:12:31,425 --> 00:12:35,045
Speaker 6:  if we've raised the cost of making games

207
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:38,685
Speaker 6:  so high and the risk so high that

208
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,925
Speaker 6:  people will have learned their lesson or if the opposite will

209
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:46,485
Speaker 6:  happen, which is despite all of the trouble we're seeing in the video game

210
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:50,685
Speaker 6:  industry financially, if GTA six will come out, it

211
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:54,565
Speaker 6:  will be a hit and then everybody will go, could be

212
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,445
Speaker 6:  me I that I could be that.

213
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:00,245
Speaker 4:  Well, so, okay, wait, explain this to me really fast because GTA five has

214
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:04,205
Speaker 4:  been out for good lord like 65 years at this point. Yeah. But GTA

215
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:07,925
Speaker 4:  six is like a, a sequel on top of sequels, on top of sequels. Like why is

216
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:11,685
Speaker 4:  Grand Theft Auto six different from say the new Call of Duty which I assume

217
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:14,965
Speaker 4:  will come out at at once a year every year until like the Heath he death

218
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:16,125
Speaker 4:  of the universe? Yeah.

219
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:19,285
Speaker 6:  I mean you, you kind of said it. They don't put them out all the time. Okay.

220
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:22,645
Speaker 6:  They work on them until they are in their opinion just right.

221
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:26,925
Speaker 6:  And they seem to know quite well even if I don't always love every bit of

222
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:30,725
Speaker 6:  their games they sell extravagantly. It's hard to say with

223
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:34,605
Speaker 6:  GTA six 'cause we haven't seen much of it. Others, some some leaked gameplay

224
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,485
Speaker 6:  footage, right? That was very, very early. But there's also

225
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:42,645
Speaker 6:  questions around that game on its own. There's different management in charge

226
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:46,605
Speaker 6:  of this game than there has been in the past. I would say the first real

227
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:50,405
Speaker 6:  shakeup of of editorial direction for this game

228
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:54,885
Speaker 6:  in the entire series is lifetime. Hmm. So again, we have this game that

229
00:13:54,885 --> 00:13:58,525
Speaker 6:  just embodies the mega budget game

230
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:03,005
Speaker 6:  and it has its own question marks around it. And I think a

231
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:06,725
Speaker 6:  lot of where we're at right now is based off of GTA Five's success and people

232
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:08,525
Speaker 6:  hoping that they can be that.

233
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:12,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Just to give a data point to that GTA five cost

234
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:16,565
Speaker 5:  around $260 million to produce. Wow. There have been recent

235
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:20,565
Speaker 5:  leaks like GTA six leaked of about a year ago

236
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:24,645
Speaker 5:  and as part of that leak there was some speculation that the games

237
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:28,525
Speaker 5:  development costs have overcome a billion dollars at this point.

238
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:32,285
Speaker 4:  Whoa. You know what this makes me think of is right before the second avatar

239
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:35,285
Speaker 4:  movie came out, James Cameron did an interview and said something to the

240
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:38,445
Speaker 4:  effect of like, this movie is gonna have to be the third biggest movie of

241
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:42,365
Speaker 4:  all time just to break even. And it's like at some point that's

242
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:45,725
Speaker 4:  a totally insane thing to say unless you're James Cameron, you, you've made

243
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:49,645
Speaker 4:  the other two biggest movies of all time and like I guess GTA six

244
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:53,245
Speaker 4:  is kind of in the same position. It's like if you're anyone other than the

245
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:56,365
Speaker 4:  people who make Grand Theft Auto, you might be outta your mind. But if anybody

246
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:59,525
Speaker 4:  has a chance to make that worthwhile, it's probably rockstar.

247
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:03,685
Speaker 6:  I guess like a thought to leave the listeners on who maybe don't follow games

248
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:07,045
Speaker 6:  closely because this might sound drained. How, how could we see the end of

249
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:10,045
Speaker 6:  AAA? And I'm not saying that there's a guarantee that that will happen at

250
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:13,925
Speaker 6:  all, but think about the Marvel era in the superhero era

251
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:17,805
Speaker 6:  that is coming to an end. It is at the very top of

252
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:21,885
Speaker 6:  pop culture until these increasingly big betts

253
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:26,245
Speaker 6:  start to like flop, right? And you get three or four of these in

254
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:29,965
Speaker 6:  a row and suddenly they're not making money and suddenly it's a bad

255
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:34,045
Speaker 6:  bet and the market signals that they're looking at other things. We

256
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:37,965
Speaker 6:  have Oppenheimer and Barbie, this You know Summer really popping off

257
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:41,365
Speaker 6:  in a lot of other movies and that's when things start to shift.

258
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:45,725
Speaker 6:  And that is a sort of shift that I am curious what it will

259
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:48,325
Speaker 6:  look like in the video game industry because it feels like we're heading

260
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,645
Speaker 6:  towards some sort of change. It's just hard to say what

261
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:53,925
Speaker 5:  It's, I mean you can look at it from a couple years ago at

262
00:15:53,975 --> 00:15:57,845
Speaker 5:  Cyberpunks launch Cyberpunk launched, it was a total disaster. That game

263
00:15:57,845 --> 00:16:01,485
Speaker 5:  was enormously expensive to produce. They've since brought it back from the

264
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:05,405
Speaker 5:  edge with updates and and DLC and all sorts of stuff. The

265
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:09,125
Speaker 5:  game is great now, but that was a representation of

266
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,885
Speaker 5:  what can happen. Even if you throw hundreds of millions of dollars

267
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,845
Speaker 5:  at a game, you are not necessarily guaranteed to get that back if the game

268
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,445
Speaker 5:  launches and it's a disaster. Yeah,

269
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:22,005
Speaker 4:  That's that's a good one. And yeah, I, I like the idea of like are we still

270
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:25,765
Speaker 4:  in the Marvel can do no wrong era or are we, are we in the,

271
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:29,645
Speaker 4:  everybody's kind of bored of Marvel era and it turns out like

272
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:32,565
Speaker 4:  you're saying Russ, you don't have to get it wrong that many times for it

273
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:36,525
Speaker 4:  to fall apart pretty fast. That's right. Alright, I am gonna go see if I

274
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:40,245
Speaker 4:  can figure out what the Barb Heimer video game era is gonna look like. And

275
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:43,365
Speaker 4:  then we're gonna come back, we're gonna talk about that. We're gonna do some

276
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:47,445
Speaker 4:  big hot Takey 2024 predictions that are gonna make everybody really angry.

277
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,045
Speaker 4:  Thank you both as always. We'll be right back.

00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,365
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. As always, it's been a few weeks through the magic

293
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:57,965
Speaker 4:  of Time travel and podcast editing. We're back. You guys look different.

294
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:00,445
Speaker 4:  I have to say you've changed since we were here last.

295
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:02,485
Speaker 5:  I've seen some things, especially

296
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:02,885
Speaker 4:  You Chris.

297
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:05,365
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah, well Plant has seen a lot of things. And

298
00:18:05,365 --> 00:18:09,245
Speaker 4:  Then so the thing we're here to talk about is big games

299
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,685
Speaker 4:  and this one was actually the most fun for me of all of the episodes that

300
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:16,485
Speaker 4:  we've done because this is a topic I know essentially nothing about. So

301
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:19,245
Speaker 4:  what essentially what we're gonna do is I did a bunch of research, I talked

302
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:22,685
Speaker 4:  to a bunch of people and I tried to like speed run my way through learning

303
00:18:22,695 --> 00:18:26,445
Speaker 4:  about the very big business of very big video games. And

304
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:30,285
Speaker 4:  I have come with some, some ideas and theories about where all of this is

305
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:33,605
Speaker 4:  headed and I want you guys to like check what I have come up with

306
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:37,325
Speaker 4:  and sort of bring it back to reality for me. How does that sound? It

307
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,325
Speaker 5:  Sounds good. Sounds great.

308
00:18:38,555 --> 00:18:42,085
Speaker 4:  Okay. So the way that I've framed this because I have, I have found myself

309
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:45,085
Speaker 4:  unnecessarily structuring all of these things is I have gone through it just

310
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:48,605
Speaker 4:  to help it make sense is like if the big question is kind of where do

311
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:52,925
Speaker 4:  AAA games go? I have four possible futures. I

312
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:56,645
Speaker 4:  don't know which one of them I think is right, but there's kind of an

313
00:18:56,665 --> 00:19:00,445
Speaker 4:  analog somewhere else in the world that could be how this goes. And I'm just

314
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:03,645
Speaker 4:  gonna walk you through all of them and we're gonna talk them out. But first

315
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:07,445
Speaker 4:  I have to say, you guys screwed me over really badly because neither of you

316
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:11,285
Speaker 4:  prepared me for the idea that absolutely no one agrees on what

317
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:15,685
Speaker 4:  AAA means or what indie means or any of these terms. And

318
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:18,285
Speaker 4:  so for every single person I talk to, I was like, let's talk about AAA games.

319
00:19:18,285 --> 00:19:20,285
Speaker 4:  And they're like, well what do you mean when you talk about AAA i's just

320
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,165
Speaker 4:  like don don't know. You're supposed to know the answer to that

321
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,445
Speaker 5:  If it makes you feel any better. The Game Awards just announced

322
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:30,725
Speaker 5:  that Dave the diver was nominated for best Indie of the year. One of

323
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:34,045
Speaker 5:  five or six that were nominated for Best Indy of the Year gave the Diver

324
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:37,205
Speaker 5:  was produced by a studio of 18 people

325
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:41,005
Speaker 5:  within Nexon, which is an enormous, enormous

326
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:45,165
Speaker 5:  company. And even Nexon has said, yeah, it's not really an

327
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:48,485
Speaker 5:  indie studio but it kind of looks indie, it's got like Pixel graphics and

328
00:19:48,485 --> 00:19:50,805
Speaker 5:  stuff. So yeah, no one knows for sure what the difference is.

329
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no it, it was, it was actually very funny prepping for this in the

330
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:56,965
Speaker 4:  process of that happening. 'cause there were a bunch of people really mad

331
00:19:56,965 --> 00:20:00,245
Speaker 4:  about that. And then the flip side was Boulder's Gate was

332
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:04,165
Speaker 4:  nominated for Oh yeah, like Game of the Year. And there were a bunch of people

333
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:06,685
Speaker 4:  saying, well that's an indie, it should have also been nominated as an indie.

334
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:09,485
Speaker 4:  And that's sparked this whole thing about what is AAA game and was an indie.

335
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:12,685
Speaker 4:  And what I've learned is that it mostly doesn't matter, like in real terms

336
00:20:13,305 --> 00:20:17,245
Speaker 4:  it doesn't matter. So, but for my purposes, just for today, we're going to

337
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:21,045
Speaker 4:  define AAA games as like the kind of two

338
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:24,805
Speaker 4:  handfuls of very big, very expensive games that

339
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:27,725
Speaker 4:  everybody has heard of. Like people who don't play games have heard of these

340
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:30,845
Speaker 4:  games, right? That's kind of, it's not a perfect definition but that's what

341
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:34,085
Speaker 4:  we're gonna do. And then Indie is like the opposite of that. And I'm not

342
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:36,965
Speaker 4:  gonna try to define it further because I will just run into trouble and don

343
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:40,285
Speaker 4:  don't need that in my life. So that's what we're gonna do. Future number

344
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,205
Speaker 4:  one, I've named all of these, I'm very excited about the names I have for

345
00:20:43,205 --> 00:20:47,165
Speaker 4:  them. Future number one is what I would call the Avengers future. And basically

346
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:50,525
Speaker 4:  what that would be is that we've spent the last

347
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:54,445
Speaker 4:  decade or so, but really sort of phase of video games

348
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:58,885
Speaker 4:  with a handful of gigantic properties

349
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:02,365
Speaker 4:  that everybody loved that just came to like completely dominate the landscape.

350
00:21:02,365 --> 00:21:05,925
Speaker 4:  Like I went through the, the most popular games of the last 10 years and

351
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:08,925
Speaker 4:  I bet the two of you sitting here now could name most of them off the top

352
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:12,885
Speaker 4:  of your head, right? Like Call of Duty appears 17 times on

353
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:16,645
Speaker 4:  the list of 10 years. Madden is there 10 times in 10 years.

354
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:20,685
Speaker 4:  GTA five, one game is there for five years. Like most of these things will

355
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:23,125
Speaker 4:  not be surprising to people. So we're in this place now where there's this

356
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:26,525
Speaker 4:  gigantic sort of earth shatteringly huge

357
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:31,365
Speaker 4:  property that owns the world. Like it's not a perfect analogy 'cause

358
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:34,645
Speaker 4:  it's a bunch of games instead of just like the cinematic universe. They've

359
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:38,045
Speaker 4:  been big for a really long time. But now there is this feeling that these

360
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:41,925
Speaker 4:  things are so big and so frankly bad.

361
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,685
Speaker 4:  Now they've gotten so risk averse because they're so big and they're so expensive

362
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:49,285
Speaker 4:  and they're so complicated that they're starting to crack and that

363
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:53,165
Speaker 4:  eventually the Avengers can't be good forever. And eventually

364
00:21:53,165 --> 00:21:56,525
Speaker 4:  that stops being good and then there is time for something else. And I think

365
00:21:56,525 --> 00:22:00,485
Speaker 4:  one case you could make is that we're like right at the end of

366
00:22:00,755 --> 00:22:04,605
Speaker 4:  this massive dominance of a handful of properties and

367
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:08,765
Speaker 4:  the next thing is starting to appear like Call of Duty, modern warfare

368
00:22:08,815 --> 00:22:12,485
Speaker 4:  three just came out by all accounts, just a garbage fire of a game.

369
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:15,805
Speaker 4:  Everybody seems to hate it. It's still selling a lot because it's Call of

370
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:19,325
Speaker 4:  Duty, but at least so far doesn't seem to be this success that the others

371
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:22,805
Speaker 4:  were. And it's like, okay, is this what started happening in Marvel a couple

372
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:26,005
Speaker 4:  of years ago where it was like the, the Shine is off a little bit, people

373
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:30,045
Speaker 4:  won't just do it because it's there. Maybe this stuff is gonna start to fall

374
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:34,005
Speaker 4:  off and the next phase is gonna be full of new things. What do you guys

375
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:34,365
Speaker 4:  think of that?

376
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:38,685
Speaker 5:  I think you're right that I think we're starting to see

377
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:43,085
Speaker 5:  the franchises that were forever easily bankable. We're starting

378
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:46,725
Speaker 5:  to see them struggle in these environments and and franchises like Call of

379
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:50,445
Speaker 5:  Duty have sustained themselves not on the, oh man, there's a huge

380
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:54,005
Speaker 5:  campaign and there's Multiplay whatever just on their, the fact that they

381
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,405
Speaker 5:  have a free to play mode that's very popular in War zone and that is

382
00:22:57,405 --> 00:23:01,285
Speaker 5:  monetized out the butt. So that's where they're making all their money. So,

383
00:23:01,365 --> 00:23:04,245
Speaker 5:  I think that's what you're gonna start to see with those bigger franchises.

384
00:23:04,405 --> 00:23:08,085
Speaker 5:  I think the other struggle that these big franchises come up against, which

385
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:11,885
Speaker 5:  is actually a good thing, is because there is so much weak in

386
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:15,725
Speaker 5:  weak out competition from smaller games that are doing

387
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:19,205
Speaker 5:  cool things, they pull time and resources and money

388
00:23:19,635 --> 00:23:23,565
Speaker 5:  away from people saying, oh, the $60 that I spend only goes to

389
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:27,085
Speaker 5:  Call of Duty or only goes to Madden or whatever it is. Instead they're gonna

390
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:30,805
Speaker 5:  say, I'm gonna buy three games for $20 each and I'm gonna play those for

391
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:34,765
Speaker 5:  30 hours, 40 hours, whatever it is. So, I actually think

392
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:38,725
Speaker 5:  this is not necessarily a bad thing what you're describing.

393
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:42,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I, to be clear, I don't necessarily think any of these are actually

394
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:45,565
Speaker 4:  bad futures. Like one of the things I wrote under the Avengers future

395
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:49,525
Speaker 4:  bullet in my notes was it's just the end of an era. Everything changes Don't

396
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:53,085
Speaker 4:  be afraid, right? Like this does not mean it's the end of good video games.

397
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:56,805
Speaker 4:  I just think it's possible. I would not say it's likely, but it's possible

398
00:23:57,075 --> 00:24:00,365
Speaker 4:  that it is. It is the end of a certain set of

399
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:01,445
Speaker 4:  video games.

400
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:06,325
Speaker 6:  I am gonna get really pedantic here do it, but I don't think it is the

401
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:09,765
Speaker 6:  end of an era at all. Okay. I think it is just a

402
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:13,445
Speaker 6:  continuation of an era because let me know what this sounds

403
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:17,285
Speaker 6:  familiar. So there's this company called Activision and it has the biggest

404
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:20,725
Speaker 6:  game in the world and it stops making all of its other games and it puts

405
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:24,405
Speaker 6:  all of its resources into that game and it actually has multiple teams

406
00:24:24,405 --> 00:24:27,485
Speaker 6:  working on different versions of that game so they can get it out every year.

407
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:30,885
Speaker 6:  Right. I'm obviously talking about Tony Hawk's Pro skater.

408
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:34,925
Speaker 6:  Sorry, actually no, I'm talking about Guitar Hero. Oh wait, no I'm, I'm talking

409
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:38,445
Speaker 6:  about Call of Duty. Overwatch You know is is now at the end of its

410
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:42,085
Speaker 6:  lifecycle with eSports or they're closing the eSports league there. There

411
00:24:42,085 --> 00:24:45,805
Speaker 6:  are ebbs and flows to these things and yes

412
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:49,365
Speaker 6:  those are down, but then Fortnite is up, right?

413
00:24:49,515 --> 00:24:53,325
Speaker 6:  Minecraft is still dominant and those things, yes, like

414
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:57,405
Speaker 6:  Fresh mentioned, they're not updating every year but they are updating constantly.

415
00:24:57,405 --> 00:25:01,045
Speaker 6:  They're finding new ways to bring in cash. It's just a slightly different

416
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:02,965
Speaker 6:  cadence and presentation.

417
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:07,205
Speaker 5:  But you would agree plant that there are way fewer AAA big

418
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:10,525
Speaker 5:  releases every year or like these years than they are five

419
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:10,965
Speaker 4:  Years ago

420
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:15,085
Speaker 6:  For sure. But if we're going off the, the I I guess specifically the Marvel

421
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:19,205
Speaker 6:  comparison I think doesn't work here because the Marvel games, the big

422
00:25:19,205 --> 00:25:23,165
Speaker 6:  games continue to exist and the big games get only bigger. They're, they're

423
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:26,845
Speaker 6:  getting larger and larger. But it's weird because on one hand I wanna agree

424
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:30,445
Speaker 6:  with that. There are fewer big games, but I don't even know if that's true

425
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:34,125
Speaker 6:  anymore. There are fewer big games made by U Bsof and EA

426
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:38,205
Speaker 6:  and Activision, but now other teams are

427
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:42,005
Speaker 6:  making big games. We're getting pretty large size

428
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:45,525
Speaker 6:  games from Sega and Atlas. We're getting large games from Remedy.

429
00:25:46,095 --> 00:25:50,085
Speaker 6:  We're getting even indie quote indie former indie studios that have a

430
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:53,805
Speaker 6:  ton of money that are now making their own very large scale

431
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:57,765
Speaker 6:  projects. So it's like a blend. We're

432
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:01,525
Speaker 6:  we're watching all these different ways of engaging with games kind of blend

433
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:05,685
Speaker 6:  together where yeah and maybe in the past it felt like no

434
00:26:05,685 --> 00:26:09,525
Speaker 6:  there are kind of two things. There was the, you play games that came

435
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:13,445
Speaker 6:  out from ea, you be soft in Activision or you played like download Blendy

436
00:26:13,525 --> 00:26:16,925
Speaker 6:  games and now yes, all of that is kind of like blurring together and the

437
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:20,725
Speaker 6:  big companies are making some downloadable games and the You know small indie

438
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:23,285
Speaker 6:  companies are actually quite big now and they're making big games and it's

439
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:24,045
Speaker 6:  just getting more messy.

440
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:28,485
Speaker 4:  You're gonna really like hypothetical future number two. Yeah Chris, but

441
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,685
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna get that, I'm gonna get to that in one second because I think,

442
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:33,645
Speaker 4:  I think what you just described is a perfectly plausible version of this.

443
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:37,365
Speaker 4:  The one thing I will say for the the Avengers future that we live in

444
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:41,405
Speaker 4:  is just from a pure like greatest hits

445
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:45,405
Speaker 4:  of gaming thing you look through and basically if

446
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:49,365
Speaker 4:  you are not sort of a plus IP like Harry Potter

447
00:26:49,505 --> 00:26:53,485
Speaker 4:  or Star Wars, if you're not a sequel, that's it. It's just those two things.

448
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:57,005
Speaker 4:  That's how you succeed in video games right now if you want to be like one

449
00:26:57,005 --> 00:27:00,925
Speaker 4:  of the 10 or 20 biggest games, those are your only two moves

450
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:04,885
Speaker 4:  right now and we've been on that path for a long time. You either, you

451
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:08,245
Speaker 4:  either make the annual sports game, you make a game based on

452
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:12,685
Speaker 4:  You know Star Wars or Harry Potter or some other

453
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:16,165
Speaker 4:  like extremely old ip. I almost said James Bond because I'm like desperate

454
00:27:16,165 --> 00:27:19,765
Speaker 4:  for more James Bond games. But Alas, or you make a sequel, we have

455
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:23,965
Speaker 4:  You know Diablo four and Resonant Evil four and Dead Island two

456
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:27,885
Speaker 4:  and Final Fantasy 658. Like this is kind of what it

457
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:31,285
Speaker 4:  takes to really have a huge hit now. And I'm leaving out the live services

458
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:34,685
Speaker 4:  stuff 'cause we're gonna get to that. But I think that is a different corner

459
00:27:34,825 --> 00:27:37,845
Speaker 4:  of the future of video games. But I'm just saying for these like giant titles

460
00:27:37,845 --> 00:27:40,725
Speaker 4:  that people pay money for, that's still kind of the world we're in.

461
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:44,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean again, success being like most

462
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:48,685
Speaker 5:  amount of profit, right? Obviously people are seeing success not only

463
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:52,485
Speaker 5:  creatively but also making a ton of money relative to what they're putting

464
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:56,125
Speaker 5:  in for smaller projects. You know if you're game costs

465
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:59,965
Speaker 5:  $10 million to make versus a hundred million dollars to make and you end

466
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:03,885
Speaker 5:  up making 50 million on it, like that's a really good return. So well

467
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:07,485
Speaker 5:  done. Yeah, You know again, it is difficult to determine

468
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:10,805
Speaker 5:  whether something is successful or not strictly on the like total copies

469
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:14,885
Speaker 5:  sold. But I do agree that like for the bestselling

470
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:18,405
Speaker 5:  list 100% it's all franchises you've always heard of.

471
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:22,565
Speaker 4:  Okay. Hypothetical future number two is what I call the

472
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:26,325
Speaker 4:  prestige TV future. And this is I think closer to what

473
00:28:26,325 --> 00:28:29,325
Speaker 4:  we've been describing, right? Which is basically we're gonna get a whole

474
00:28:29,565 --> 00:28:33,285
Speaker 4:  industry shifting away from there being kind of one big

475
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:37,245
Speaker 4:  giant move, which is like make big movies,

476
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:41,445
Speaker 4:  put them in theaters and try to make a lot of money and towards something

477
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:45,605
Speaker 4:  a little broader, a little different, the business model changes a little

478
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:48,765
Speaker 4:  bit but it lets you do all kinds of different stuff. You can start to take

479
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:52,565
Speaker 4:  a-list actors and make limited series and sell them that way. You can start

480
00:28:52,685 --> 00:28:56,045
Speaker 4:  to make longer running TV shows, you can make documentaries have a comeback

481
00:28:56,045 --> 00:29:00,005
Speaker 4:  like this idea that by upending the way the business works

482
00:29:00,065 --> 00:29:03,605
Speaker 4:  and essentially taking it out of a couple of company's hands, you give people

483
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:07,325
Speaker 4:  many more ways to make things at many different

484
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:10,365
Speaker 4:  scales that make money. Which I think to some extent like

485
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:14,805
Speaker 4:  signals a big part of the end of like these unbelievably expensive AAA

486
00:29:14,805 --> 00:29:18,485
Speaker 4:  games because that no longer is the only move is to spend an outrageous amount

487
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:21,845
Speaker 4:  of money to try to make an outrageous amount of money and means this whole

488
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:25,325
Speaker 4:  other class of stuff can start to come up. And just based on what we've been

489
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:27,965
Speaker 4:  talking about, it sounds like maybe that's a little closer to what you guys

490
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:29,045
Speaker 4:  have been seeing already.

491
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:33,685
Speaker 6:  It's so tough because I So I feel like we talked about this and I can't

492
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:37,565
Speaker 6:  remember which episode on, but like the each platform or each

493
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:41,365
Speaker 6:  store is going for different things. So Nintendo is making

494
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:45,005
Speaker 6:  great toys. They also make easy to like ship indie games on their thing,

495
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:48,925
Speaker 6:  right? But you're getting the Nintendo product when you go to Nintendo. I

496
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:51,485
Speaker 6:  think what you're talking about doesn't quite align with like what I think

497
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:55,205
Speaker 6:  of with Sony, which is Sony is we are a showcase

498
00:29:55,345 --> 00:29:59,285
Speaker 6:  of of hardware in your living room and we're going to continue to make

499
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:03,165
Speaker 6:  these 70 to $80 video games that are very, very

500
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:07,005
Speaker 6:  fancy and blockbuster, right? And that's our brand. What you are

501
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,685
Speaker 6:  describing makes a lot of sense to me for Xbox and

502
00:30:10,985 --> 00:30:14,725
Speaker 6:  as, especially as it pushes onto Game Pass where there becomes much more

503
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:18,525
Speaker 6:  value in novelty and just

504
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:21,965
Speaker 6:  pure raw output. The number of things that you are shipping

505
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:26,365
Speaker 6:  and less on, Hey here's the one game that you're going

506
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:29,805
Speaker 6:  to play for the next five years game. Xbox I think

507
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:33,885
Speaker 6:  would be much happier for you to play 10 games a month than

508
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:37,765
Speaker 6:  one game a month because you're playing, ultimately the product is

509
00:30:37,765 --> 00:30:41,725
Speaker 6:  Game Pass. The games are just a piece of that, right? So

510
00:30:42,085 --> 00:30:45,685
Speaker 6:  I can see what you're talking about. I think it also leans itself into Steam.

511
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:50,605
Speaker 6:  But at the end of the day, the thing that I, I'm curious what

512
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:54,325
Speaker 6:  both you and Fresh think about is still the financial risk just making

513
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:59,045
Speaker 6:  games remains very expensive. It's much cheaper than it ever

514
00:30:59,105 --> 00:31:02,405
Speaker 6:  was before in terms of distribution and You know engines,

515
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:06,645
Speaker 6:  but it is really risky and don don't know how

516
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:08,925
Speaker 6:  what you're describing mitigates that risk.

517
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:12,285
Speaker 5:  I mean the risk of making a 60 hour

518
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:16,565
Speaker 5:  giant open world game is unquestionably enormous.

519
00:31:16,715 --> 00:31:20,685
Speaker 5:  It's probably the riskiest thing you can do. The risk of making a four

520
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:24,605
Speaker 5:  hour narrative adventure that Microsoft wants because it's

521
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:28,285
Speaker 5:  a good advertisement for Game Pass is a lot lower. Like

522
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:32,125
Speaker 5:  it takes two as like kind of a great example of something that is like

523
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:36,005
Speaker 5:  not that risk. I mean it has some risk, obviously it's a weird divorce game,

524
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:40,205
Speaker 5:  but it's not that risky from an overall scale of the project standpoint.

525
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:44,845
Speaker 5:  And I think You know Microsoft has the deep pockets that can pay for

526
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:48,725
Speaker 5:  things and if one of those fails it doesn't mean game Pass fails. You

527
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:52,525
Speaker 5:  look at Red Fall, that's a good example. Red Fall was an an enormous project

528
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:57,045
Speaker 5:  that really had a disastrous launch, came out on Game Pass, was

529
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:01,005
Speaker 5:  supposed to be like a big push for Game Pass. And the fact that it

530
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:04,045
Speaker 5:  like didn't Sink Game Pass long term is telling it how

531
00:32:04,605 --> 00:32:08,245
Speaker 5:  divested Microsoft is on this surface with all the other releases that were

532
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:08,685
Speaker 5:  coming out.

533
00:32:09,165 --> 00:32:12,965
Speaker 6:  I will say two different things about risk there in relation to that. You,

534
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:16,965
Speaker 6:  you kind of hit the nail on the head with the game pass of it all. Yes if,

535
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:20,925
Speaker 6:  if Microsoft has given you a contract before you start making this

536
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:24,765
Speaker 6:  thing, yeah there's definitely not that much risk there. You know you have

537
00:32:24,765 --> 00:32:28,485
Speaker 6:  a great thing going for you, but most developers are not going

538
00:32:28,545 --> 00:32:31,485
Speaker 6:  to have that. They might not even know if they should be on Game Pass or

539
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:35,445
Speaker 6:  not. And whether you're making a giant game or a small

540
00:32:35,445 --> 00:32:38,965
Speaker 6:  game, it's all relative to you making money at the end of the day. Right.

541
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:43,165
Speaker 6:  I, I think the other thing that I, that I'm just kind of bashing up

542
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:47,005
Speaker 6:  against with this theory in terms of like the business and where the

543
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:50,845
Speaker 6:  people who the investors, the board members go is we're gonna have

544
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:54,525
Speaker 6:  Grand Theft Auto six come out next year or the year after that and

545
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:58,325
Speaker 6:  every board member is gonna say, that's what I want. I wanna continue getting

546
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:02,405
Speaker 6:  that. That's absurd number and I'm not gonna get that because

547
00:33:02,765 --> 00:33:06,565
Speaker 6:  somebody released a cooperative divorce game. I'm gonna get it. Because again,

548
00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:10,445
Speaker 6:  they keep chasing this thing and so long as these big

549
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:14,565
Speaker 6:  companies are tied to those boards, don don't know how

550
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:18,365
Speaker 6:  the big companies get away from it. And maybe that's, maybe that's it. Maybe

551
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:22,205
Speaker 6:  they're like doomed, like maybe You know that, that they're weirdly

552
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:26,085
Speaker 6:  their shareholders are this albatross with where the direction that

553
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:28,005
Speaker 6:  the industry is going in. I, I don't know.

554
00:33:28,355 --> 00:33:32,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. One of the most sort of fascinating threads of this entire like reporting

555
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:35,845
Speaker 4:  and research project was talking to people who

556
00:33:36,195 --> 00:33:40,005
Speaker 4:  like care about games at like an emotional sort of, I play games level

557
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:44,045
Speaker 4:  and those people cannot fathom why all of these

558
00:33:44,325 --> 00:33:47,685
Speaker 4:  companies have stopped caring about making games that are fun to play. Because

559
00:33:47,685 --> 00:33:50,085
Speaker 4:  if you make games that are fun to play, people will play them, then you'll

560
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:53,565
Speaker 4:  sell more of them and everybody wins, right? And then I talk to people on

561
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,885
Speaker 4:  the business side who are essentially like making games fun to play is like

562
00:33:56,885 --> 00:34:00,365
Speaker 4:  not the point. Like we're a business, we're here to make money and if

563
00:34:00,745 --> 00:34:03,925
Speaker 4:  we can make more money while making the game slightly less fun to play, but

564
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:07,845
Speaker 4:  people still buy the game, like that becomes a harder choice than I think

565
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:11,285
Speaker 4:  you would like it to be. And like people tell the story of Halo all the time,

566
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:13,885
Speaker 4:  right? I feel like it's, it's like sort of the canonical version of this,

567
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,765
Speaker 4:  right? Like you have Bungee, which makes great games because it wants

568
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:20,845
Speaker 4:  to make great games and then it gets so big that it kind of gets crushed

569
00:34:20,865 --> 00:34:24,645
Speaker 4:  by its own bigness and it switches developers and the culture is different.

570
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,285
Speaker 4:  It becomes about making money and then Halo just kind of like falls in on

571
00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:32,245
Speaker 4:  itself like a dying star over time. But I think you're right in

572
00:34:32,245 --> 00:34:36,045
Speaker 4:  that that tension is super real, but it also gets

573
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:39,725
Speaker 4:  to a point where eventually that's gonna turn on somebody in a really big

574
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:43,925
Speaker 4:  like earth shakingly huge way that's gonna make everybody afraid.

575
00:34:44,405 --> 00:34:47,645
Speaker 5:  I mean it it, it has, I mean Halo is a great example of that. Yeah. Like

576
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:51,165
Speaker 5:  this is the big one of the biggest franchises ever in the history of video

577
00:34:51,165 --> 00:34:54,805
Speaker 5:  games and because of it wasn't just monetization

578
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:58,165
Speaker 5:  decisions, that was part of it. They made some like pretty scummy monetization

579
00:34:58,405 --> 00:35:02,205
Speaker 5:  decisions but also like design issues and technical

580
00:35:02,205 --> 00:35:05,965
Speaker 5:  issues and like all that stuff You know resulted in

581
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:09,965
Speaker 5:  a major calamity for this franchise that will need to be rebooted

582
00:35:10,095 --> 00:35:13,885
Speaker 5:  again. Yeah. And that is like a total cautionary tale

583
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:18,205
Speaker 5:  for all of these companies that is like, okay, well

584
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:20,885
Speaker 5:  there's a limit to what you can do. You know Battlefront Two was another

585
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:24,845
Speaker 5:  example of that and You know, even Cyberpunk was another example of that

586
00:35:24,845 --> 00:35:28,685
Speaker 5:  where like You know they've righted the ship, but it

587
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:32,445
Speaker 5:  took them several years to get there and that was an enormous

588
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:36,405
Speaker 5:  risk. And, and I do think you will start to hear

589
00:35:36,745 --> 00:35:40,605
Speaker 5:  within these giant companies some pushback because

590
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:44,525
Speaker 5:  someone will say, Hey, we need to push this out in fall of 2024

591
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:48,045
Speaker 5:  or whatever it is. And someone else is gonna say, yeah, but remember what

592
00:35:48,205 --> 00:35:51,085
Speaker 5:  happened to Cyberpunk Was that good for our bottom line, right? Maybe we

593
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:54,445
Speaker 5:  should wait six months. And I think star fielders representation of that,

594
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:58,365
Speaker 5:  like they delayed that game basically a full year. It was done and dusted

595
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:01,725
Speaker 5:  for a full year and they spent that all on Polish. I'm not saying that's

596
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:05,285
Speaker 5:  a great game, but like clearly it's one of the cleanest games that

597
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:09,205
Speaker 5:  Bethesda's ever released. So I do think there is a

598
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:11,125
Speaker 5:  slight sea change going on.

599
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:15,405
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I I maybe a comparison is not just the

600
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:19,125
Speaker 6:  the Prestige TV but the end of the studio era

601
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,605
Speaker 6:  in filmmaking, which is like the twenties to the fifties where it's like

602
00:36:22,605 --> 00:36:25,885
Speaker 6:  these like just a handful of studios have total control.

603
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:30,325
Speaker 6:  Even the the talent there is like they're good for tabloids, but they are,

604
00:36:30,325 --> 00:36:32,645
Speaker 6:  they are, they do not have much of a say no

605
00:36:32,885 --> 00:36:35,885
Speaker 4:  They like signed contracts with the studio and then did whatever the studio

606
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:36,885
Speaker 4:  told them to do. Yeah,

607
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:40,725
Speaker 6:  Exactly. And the studios themselves had a lot more say in distribution

608
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:44,885
Speaker 6:  and that yeah, maybe we are coming out of that for

609
00:36:44,885 --> 00:36:48,685
Speaker 6:  games and we will see something similar to what we saw for film in the

610
00:36:48,685 --> 00:36:50,285
Speaker 6:  sixties and seventies. So this is Phil

611
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:54,165
Speaker 4:  Spencer's big theory, right? Is that he, he wrote that email that came out

612
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:57,645
Speaker 4:  in the, the Xbox leaks over the summer basically saying that

613
00:36:57,985 --> 00:37:01,485
Speaker 4:  now that the handful of big publishers don't have like that

614
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:06,045
Speaker 4:  retail store shelves distribution monopoly, everything has suddenly

615
00:37:06,115 --> 00:37:09,085
Speaker 4:  open and those companies have been slow to figure it out. Like that's, I

616
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:12,005
Speaker 4:  think there's something to that theory. I think we're probably just at the

617
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:15,765
Speaker 4:  beginning of that because there's more to just store shelves than

618
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:19,125
Speaker 4:  in in changing the way people find and buy games. But I do think, I think

619
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:22,045
Speaker 4:  you're onto something and at the end of that road is something like Game

620
00:37:22,045 --> 00:37:24,845
Speaker 4:  Pass, right? Which changes the way we think about discovery because you don't

621
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:27,365
Speaker 4:  have to buy a game before you can play it. You can just show up and play

622
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:30,765
Speaker 4:  it. It changes the way the games get made because they're gonna end up You

623
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:34,045
Speaker 4:  know a lot of cases getting paid for how people play, not just by getting

624
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:37,925
Speaker 4:  you to buy the game with by calling it Hogwarts. All of that feels

625
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:40,925
Speaker 4:  like it's, it's in the middle of like being turned on its head right now.

626
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:41,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

627
00:37:41,765 --> 00:37:45,205
Speaker 5:  I do wanna be careful though because when we say, oh this might be the end

628
00:37:45,205 --> 00:37:49,125
Speaker 5:  of like the studio era, we are still in a circumstance where like

629
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:52,925
Speaker 5:  a very, very small number of companies are

630
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:57,445
Speaker 5:  in control of the vast majority of the generation of

631
00:37:57,445 --> 00:38:01,245
Speaker 5:  wealth within the games industry. Microsoft just merged with with Activision.

632
00:38:01,805 --> 00:38:05,765
Speaker 5:  That is a huge percentage of the game space. Yeah. Look

633
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:09,725
Speaker 5:  at how much valve controls the PC gaming market and

634
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:13,645
Speaker 5:  that's what are they getting 30% on each sale for that? I mean effectively

635
00:38:13,645 --> 00:38:17,525
Speaker 5:  that's a studio deal in a lot of ways. So You know, I don't think

636
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:21,565
Speaker 5:  it's that divested among So. I mean a lot of people

637
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:25,605
Speaker 5:  are making money in games, don't get me wrong, but like mostly it's these

638
00:38:25,605 --> 00:38:29,245
Speaker 5:  like eight companies that are like doing very well and I think it'll only

639
00:38:29,565 --> 00:38:33,325
Speaker 5:  increase to combat what you were just talking about because the way to solve

640
00:38:33,635 --> 00:38:37,525
Speaker 5:  that problem of not having the store shelves is acquisition You

641
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:41,485
Speaker 5:  know Microsoft going out, buying Bethesda, buying Activision You know

642
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:45,205
Speaker 5:  Sony needs to make the same sort of moves to ensure that they have these

643
00:38:45,565 --> 00:38:49,525
Speaker 5:  franchises that can like rise above. And again, all that does is

644
00:38:49,525 --> 00:38:51,245
Speaker 5:  just make it fewer and fewer companies.

645
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:55,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I found one study that said the, the public gaming

646
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:59,805
Speaker 4:  companies like Nintendo and EA and a few others right now have more than

647
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:03,605
Speaker 4:  $45 billion between them just in cash sitting around. And obviously

648
00:39:03,605 --> 00:39:06,485
Speaker 4:  that's not gonna buy you an Activision, but there's only one Activision and

649
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:09,645
Speaker 4:  Microsoft already did that. And so the, the theory coming out of that was

650
00:39:09,665 --> 00:39:13,365
Speaker 4:  we might be in for a huge phase of

651
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:17,885
Speaker 4:  consolidations and acquisition and we're gonna go from this

652
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:21,125
Speaker 4:  sort of interesting splintering of people who can make

653
00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:25,685
Speaker 4:  big good cool, exciting games and that might all start

654
00:39:25,685 --> 00:39:28,365
Speaker 4:  to get compressed again because it's gonna get bought by the same handful

655
00:39:28,385 --> 00:39:31,325
Speaker 4:  of companies that have been doing this for a really long time. I think that's

656
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:33,605
Speaker 4:  very possible and I think would be kind of bad news.

657
00:39:34,245 --> 00:39:38,205
Speaker 6:  I maybe the only hesitation I have with that is like we've

658
00:39:38,205 --> 00:39:42,165
Speaker 6:  seen Embracer group try to do that, right? Like a large company

659
00:39:42,185 --> 00:39:45,525
Speaker 6:  be like, I'm gonna buy up 30 different things and try to run 'em all

660
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:49,285
Speaker 6:  and it doesn't work. Well. I think there's a reason that even

661
00:39:49,775 --> 00:39:53,085
Speaker 6:  again going back to film studios, they let a lot of

662
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:57,165
Speaker 6:  independent creators and studios and groups make something and

663
00:39:57,165 --> 00:40:00,925
Speaker 6:  they go and acquire that product and then they like

664
00:40:01,275 --> 00:40:04,805
Speaker 6:  they, they, one, they avoid the risk of like the early days of development,

665
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:08,925
Speaker 6:  but two, they're not managing so many things. I wouldn't be

666
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:12,525
Speaker 6:  surprised if people made the bad decision to like over consolidate and try

667
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:16,285
Speaker 6:  to get as many studios under your banner as possible. But I,

668
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:20,685
Speaker 6:  at the same time, I'm impressed by Disney who keeps, I feel like every other

669
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:24,645
Speaker 6:  week you hear Disney needs to go out and buy a video game in the studio.

670
00:40:24,665 --> 00:40:28,005
Speaker 6:  That's the best thing for Disney. And it's like no You know what's great

671
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:31,925
Speaker 6:  for Disney having control of all this different IP that everybody wants to

672
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:35,685
Speaker 6:  work for having no overhead cost and being able to set how much money you

673
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:36,645
Speaker 6:  want from each project.

674
00:40:37,355 --> 00:40:41,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well and that like to, just to pull it back to the, like the

675
00:40:41,265 --> 00:40:45,045
Speaker 4:  TV streaming era, that's very much how we got

676
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:48,525
Speaker 4:  peak tv, right? You have all these different players looking for content.

677
00:40:48,705 --> 00:40:52,565
Speaker 4:  You get into this place where like being someone who makes good things becomes

678
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:55,645
Speaker 4:  an incredible advantage because you're gonna, you have all this competition

679
00:40:55,945 --> 00:40:59,165
Speaker 4:  for your work and everybody's looking for new things and so the, like you

680
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:03,005
Speaker 4:  get this phase of frankly too much spending on the

681
00:41:03,165 --> 00:41:06,805
Speaker 4:  like distributors side, but it's a huge win for the people who like make

682
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:10,765
Speaker 4:  and consume content. So like it all turns into a giant mess, which is

683
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:13,725
Speaker 4:  what we're living through in the TV world right now. But there is a phase

684
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:16,485
Speaker 4:  where like if, if that comes true like you're describing Chris, we might

685
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:19,565
Speaker 4:  get a hell of a lot of really good games really fast, which could be very

686
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:19,965
Speaker 4:  exciting.

687
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:23,765
Speaker 6:  I'm so curious what number three is gonna be here.

688
00:41:24,155 --> 00:41:25,645
Speaker 4:  Okay, do you want to hear number three?

689
00:41:26,105 --> 00:41:26,805
Speaker 6:  Yes. Oh

690
00:41:26,835 --> 00:41:29,885
Speaker 4:  Shit, I have two more and I can't decide which to do first. All, right? We'll

691
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:32,645
Speaker 4:  just do number three right now. Number three is what I call the iPhone future.

692
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:37,045
Speaker 4:  Okay. Which is that everybody starts to complain that the

693
00:41:37,045 --> 00:41:40,965
Speaker 4:  big thing is boring now everybody gets mad and oh would you look at that?

694
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,845
Speaker 4:  It just keeps winning. And the part of me that thinks this

695
00:41:44,845 --> 00:41:47,885
Speaker 4:  might be the truth is the part of me that has talked to folks who say some

696
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:50,885
Speaker 4:  of these franchises we have are just completely

697
00:41:51,705 --> 00:41:55,125
Speaker 4:  un killable that there is nothing you can do to

698
00:41:55,565 --> 00:41:58,685
Speaker 4:  Assassin's Creed. There's no version of Assassin's Creed you can make that

699
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,885
Speaker 4:  is so bad that people will stop playing it or that people will stop making

700
00:42:01,885 --> 00:42:05,685
Speaker 4:  it. Same for Call of Duty, same for Madden. Everybody's gonna keep making

701
00:42:05,685 --> 00:42:08,485
Speaker 4:  Star Wars games because it's Star Wars. Everybody's gonna keep making Harry Potter

702
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:12,125
Speaker 4:  games because it's Harry Potter and that world is now

703
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:16,085
Speaker 4:  so big and so successful that breaking it up or even

704
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:20,205
Speaker 4:  breaking into it is going to be much harder than anybody reckons

705
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:23,365
Speaker 4:  for. And there might be a bunch of cool folks on the outside competing for

706
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:26,925
Speaker 4:  scraps, but like the winners are gonna stay the winners no matter what they

707
00:42:26,925 --> 00:42:27,725
Speaker 4:  do. It

708
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:31,005
Speaker 5:  Is funny that you mentioned Assassin's Creed at the top there because Assassin's

709
00:42:31,005 --> 00:42:34,765
Speaker 5:  Creed historically was an annual franchise just started

710
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:38,725
Speaker 5:  You know Ubisoft was pumping them out at an insane rate and then

711
00:42:38,795 --> 00:42:42,445
Speaker 5:  just recently, like You know, they released Fal Hallow and the Xbox Series

712
00:42:42,525 --> 00:42:45,925
Speaker 5:  X and PlayStation five launched and then had like a gap of

713
00:42:46,255 --> 00:42:50,125
Speaker 5:  three or four years between that and Mirage, which just came out

714
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:54,565
Speaker 5:  to like kind of tepid reviews. I think that's a representation of like

715
00:42:54,995 --> 00:42:58,045
Speaker 5:  Yousoft realizing, hey there's a lot of burnout here and we can't keep up

716
00:42:58,045 --> 00:43:01,765
Speaker 5:  with it. It is not necessarily the bankable franchise that it once

717
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:05,845
Speaker 5:  was So I. While I agree with you like Assassin creed's not

718
00:43:05,845 --> 00:43:09,725
Speaker 5:  gonna like go away forever. I don't think it's the like lock

719
00:43:09,735 --> 00:43:11,645
Speaker 5:  solid guarantee that it once was.

720
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:15,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And and I think you already named Halo. Yeah. And

721
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:19,525
Speaker 6:  before that we talked about Tony Hawk and Guitar Hero, nothing's un killable

722
00:43:19,745 --> 00:43:23,445
Speaker 4:  To be fair, nobody killed Tony Hawk. Tony Hawk remains, he's

723
00:43:23,575 --> 00:43:24,125
Speaker 5:  Doing great.

724
00:43:25,195 --> 00:43:29,045
Speaker 6:  That depends on which conspiracy theories you believe. I could

725
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:32,885
Speaker 6:  see that in the, in the sense that like yes, certain IP that transcend

726
00:43:32,895 --> 00:43:36,765
Speaker 6:  games like Hogwarts or whatever. Yeah

727
00:43:36,765 --> 00:43:40,205
Speaker 6:  of course they're just gonna keep making them and once they You know

728
00:43:40,715 --> 00:43:44,245
Speaker 6:  burn through one developer, they'll go to a different one. I could maybe,

729
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:48,365
Speaker 6:  I think the exception to the rule here is yes, something like Call of Duty

730
00:43:49,135 --> 00:43:53,085
Speaker 6:  where it will extend long beyond

731
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:57,365
Speaker 6:  its lifecycle. But You know Call of Duty, modern Warfare three might

732
00:43:57,365 --> 00:44:01,245
Speaker 6:  have been You know, laughed off the face of Meta critic War

733
00:44:01,295 --> 00:44:05,165
Speaker 6:  zones, still making plenty of money. You know like so they're,

734
00:44:05,165 --> 00:44:08,685
Speaker 6:  they've done the thing that I think Esof wanted to do with Assassin's Creed,

735
00:44:08,685 --> 00:44:11,965
Speaker 6:  which was hey we need to get away from these annual games,

736
00:44:12,545 --> 00:44:16,165
Speaker 6:  we need to get a like living game version of this out.

737
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:20,525
Speaker 6:  And we're still waiting for that with Assassin's Creed where so

738
00:44:20,545 --> 00:44:23,845
Speaker 6:  far Call of Duty has done a pretty good job of

739
00:44:24,315 --> 00:44:27,965
Speaker 6:  adjusting and, and they have a history of doing this. You know they had

740
00:44:27,985 --> 00:44:31,525
Speaker 6:  mobile Call of Duty games that were available and I believe in

741
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:35,325
Speaker 6:  China, South Korea, Japan, years, years ago

742
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:39,165
Speaker 6:  before they were even here, they, they I believe had a partnership with Tencent.

743
00:44:39,475 --> 00:44:43,125
Speaker 6:  This is things that you'll need to fact check, but they're aware that they

744
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:46,405
Speaker 6:  have to evolve with the times and then yes, the core product can just kind

745
00:44:46,405 --> 00:44:49,965
Speaker 6:  of keep being there. It's funny talking about all the

746
00:44:49,985 --> 00:44:53,805
Speaker 6:  Marvel stuff in the superhero era 'cause it's not so unlike

747
00:44:53,915 --> 00:44:57,565
Speaker 6:  what Marvel has done with comics, right? Yeah. Comics themselves

748
00:44:57,785 --> 00:45:01,205
Speaker 6:  go up and down, but they're always trying to get into

749
00:45:01,715 --> 00:45:05,405
Speaker 6:  film or TV or audio books or who knows what else. And

750
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:09,685
Speaker 6:  even if the original comics are not the top sellers, they're, they never

751
00:45:09,695 --> 00:45:10,565
Speaker 6:  fully go away.

752
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:14,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think that's right. And I think one of the things for me that has

753
00:45:14,765 --> 00:45:17,845
Speaker 4:  been the most interesting in trying to figure out this particular future

754
00:45:17,865 --> 00:45:21,645
Speaker 4:  is it feels like, I do think some of these franchises

755
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:25,685
Speaker 4:  are if not too big to die, like damn hard to

756
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:28,405
Speaker 4:  kill. But then there's also this thing, like you talk about the live services

757
00:45:28,405 --> 00:45:32,285
Speaker 4:  game and, and it also feels like we now have this dominant generation

758
00:45:32,305 --> 00:45:35,805
Speaker 4:  of a handful of those games. You have You know Roblox and

759
00:45:35,885 --> 00:45:39,605
Speaker 4:  Fortnite and don Don't know Apex Legends kind of

760
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:43,925
Speaker 4:  and War Zone and like there probably aren't more than five

761
00:45:43,925 --> 00:45:47,005
Speaker 4:  of these games that essentially dominate that space.

762
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:51,645
Speaker 4:  And it also feels like those are now so entrenched that it might be hard

763
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,405
Speaker 4:  for someone else to come in and do it. So maybe don don't know, maybe, maybe

764
00:45:54,405 --> 00:45:58,245
Speaker 4:  that old version was like the iPod era and now

765
00:45:58,265 --> 00:46:01,645
Speaker 4:  the live services games or the iPhone like poised to do the next 15 years

766
00:46:02,185 --> 00:46:04,205
Speaker 4:  and maybe that's just the cycle we're in now.

767
00:46:04,705 --> 00:46:08,685
Speaker 5:  We were talking about risk and I was saying how a 60 hour open world RPG

768
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:12,325
Speaker 5:  is a huge amount of risk these days. Doing a free to play high

769
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:16,125
Speaker 5:  budget game in the live services space is enormously

770
00:46:16,135 --> 00:46:19,845
Speaker 5:  risky. Yeah, it is so hard because those games in particular

771
00:46:19,995 --> 00:46:23,805
Speaker 5:  more so than like the star fields of the world free to play live

772
00:46:23,805 --> 00:46:27,685
Speaker 5:  service games are designed to maintain the player base. There's

773
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:31,285
Speaker 5:  no winning those games. You're always constantly given stuff to

774
00:46:31,465 --> 00:46:35,205
Speaker 5:  unlock or buy or whatever it is. Fortnite changes every other

775
00:46:35,205 --> 00:46:39,045
Speaker 5:  week. They are constantly trying to hold on. So you would literally have

776
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:42,365
Speaker 5:  to steal players away from the other game that they're playing

777
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:46,765
Speaker 5:  to have your game be successful. To the point where Remedy, who

778
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:50,525
Speaker 5:  just put out Allen Wake two to a critical claim announced very

779
00:46:50,765 --> 00:46:53,565
Speaker 5:  recently that they were working on a multiplayer free to play live service

780
00:46:53,595 --> 00:46:57,525
Speaker 5:  game that is no longer free to play and more narrative focused and

781
00:46:57,525 --> 00:47:00,965
Speaker 5:  more driven by what they're good at. So I think

782
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:05,245
Speaker 5:  companies are realizing how disastrous it can be trying to

783
00:47:05,245 --> 00:47:09,165
Speaker 5:  jump into a space that is already pretty well dominated by a handful of

784
00:47:09,165 --> 00:47:09,365
Speaker 5:  players.

785
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:13,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The the network effects of it are just so big to me. That's the thing

786
00:47:13,285 --> 00:47:17,045
Speaker 4:  I keep, I keep thinking about. It's like you not only have to get me to think

787
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:20,645
Speaker 4:  a game is cool, you have to get a bunch of people I like and then a many

788
00:47:20,795 --> 00:47:24,645
Speaker 4:  tens of millions of strangers to also think it's cool before I can actually

789
00:47:24,645 --> 00:47:28,125
Speaker 4:  like do anything in it. But the flip side of that is the

790
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:32,245
Speaker 4:  reward seems to be higher than ever, right? Like the, the sense is

791
00:47:32,545 --> 00:47:36,325
Speaker 4:  we can build this game essentially once and make

792
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:39,925
Speaker 4:  money from it forever. And that seems to be what everybody wants now.

793
00:47:39,925 --> 00:47:43,725
Speaker 5:  Fortnite revenue is astronomical. I You know some of the

794
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:47,445
Speaker 5:  leaks came out as part of the Epic lawsuit and like it is

795
00:47:47,495 --> 00:47:51,325
Speaker 5:  staggering how much money they're making. But you have to keep in mind, even

796
00:47:51,325 --> 00:47:54,645
Speaker 5:  though it seems like you're right, you could just make one game and You know

797
00:47:54,965 --> 00:47:58,725
Speaker 5:  maintain it or whatever it is and and people just stick around. That is very

798
00:47:58,725 --> 00:48:02,245
Speaker 5:  much not the case. The only way you can get people to stick around is by

799
00:48:02,615 --> 00:48:06,045
Speaker 5:  constantly changing it, adding new maps, adding new modes,

800
00:48:06,415 --> 00:48:10,405
Speaker 5:  skins, whatever it is forever. Like there's no ending to that. Yeah. So

801
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:14,445
Speaker 5:  you really are committing to this forever tale to maintain that

802
00:48:14,445 --> 00:48:18,285
Speaker 5:  player base so that You know it's, it is not as easy as you have your

803
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:21,845
Speaker 5:  smash hit and then it's, it's good to go. But it that that also

804
00:48:21,935 --> 00:48:25,485
Speaker 5:  shows you how hard it is to jump into the space because people are committing

805
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:28,845
Speaker 5:  to not a three year project but a 20 year project.

806
00:48:29,215 --> 00:48:32,765
Speaker 4:  Chris, what do you make of all that are is live services just going to take

807
00:48:32,765 --> 00:48:34,205
Speaker 4:  everything over for this next phase?

808
00:48:34,505 --> 00:48:38,485
Speaker 6:  It definitely won't take everything over. Everything exists at the

809
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:42,125
Speaker 6:  same time. You know it helps to think of video games like

810
00:48:42,325 --> 00:48:46,205
Speaker 6:  channels on a tv. They can all be doing

811
00:48:46,285 --> 00:48:50,165
Speaker 6:  a different thing. You know you can, you can go to CNN and have 24 hour

812
00:48:50,165 --> 00:48:53,245
Speaker 6:  news and you can have a 24 hour thing. You can go to another channel and

813
00:48:53,245 --> 00:48:56,405
Speaker 6:  it's like the Weather Channel and they do the same thing every five minutes.

814
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:57,045
Speaker 6:  Right. But

815
00:48:57,045 --> 00:49:00,605
Speaker 4:  The You know why that's a fun example is because a handful of those channels

816
00:49:00,745 --> 00:49:01,845
Speaker 4:  pay for all the rest of them.

817
00:49:02,035 --> 00:49:05,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And most people only use three or four of those channels. Right. And

818
00:49:05,165 --> 00:49:07,645
Speaker 6:  yet you would say like, Hey, do you like tv? And they're like, yes,

819
00:49:08,665 --> 00:49:11,205
Speaker 4:  But don don't think anybody means the Weather Channel when they say they

820
00:49:11,205 --> 00:49:11,805
Speaker 4:  like tv. Like

821
00:49:11,825 --> 00:49:15,525
Speaker 6:  No, they mean the Weather channel. I mean, have you seen the CG on the Weather

822
00:49:15,525 --> 00:49:17,565
Speaker 6:  Channel lately? They're doing wild stuff. Listen,

823
00:49:17,585 --> 00:49:20,645
Speaker 4:  The weather channel's sick, the thing they do with the storm surges, like

824
00:49:20,665 --> 00:49:20,965
Speaker 4:  I'm all

825
00:49:20,965 --> 00:49:24,845
Speaker 6:  About it. They have no respect for human dignity. No, I

826
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:28,525
Speaker 6:  think it's easy to think of video games and video game

827
00:49:28,805 --> 00:49:32,205
Speaker 6:  business as this monolithic force. But it really is,

828
00:49:32,675 --> 00:49:36,565
Speaker 6:  it's a sports industry. It's a lifestyle industry. It is a children's

829
00:49:36,565 --> 00:49:40,405
Speaker 6:  entertainment industry. It is a grownup single player thing. It is a

830
00:49:40,405 --> 00:49:44,165
Speaker 6:  means of communication. It is all these different things. And

831
00:49:44,685 --> 00:49:48,005
Speaker 6:  I mean I think that is probably the reality of everything that we're talking

832
00:49:48,005 --> 00:49:51,245
Speaker 6:  about is all of the futures that you're talking about are going to be true

833
00:49:51,545 --> 00:49:55,125
Speaker 6:  in some capacity and they're going to overlap and

834
00:49:55,415 --> 00:49:59,325
Speaker 6:  often conflict with each other. It'll just depend on like what are the

835
00:49:59,325 --> 00:50:03,205
Speaker 6:  type of games that you see as the video game industry? I,

836
00:50:03,275 --> 00:50:06,565
Speaker 6:  when you go to the Game Developers conference in San Francisco, every year

837
00:50:06,915 --> 00:50:10,405
Speaker 6:  they have these summits that are broken up with like the VR summit,

838
00:50:10,865 --> 00:50:14,725
Speaker 6:  the free to play summit, right? And the business people

839
00:50:14,725 --> 00:50:18,445
Speaker 6:  that that attracts are just completely different

840
00:50:18,695 --> 00:50:22,605
Speaker 6:  human beings. They, they're, they're strategies, the type of games

841
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:26,405
Speaker 6:  they're making, everything about it is so distinct that you could

842
00:50:26,405 --> 00:50:30,325
Speaker 6:  go to one of them and think, wow, this is everything. And then you walk into

843
00:50:30,365 --> 00:50:33,285
Speaker 6:  a room across the hall and you're like, I'm hearing the exact opposite of

844
00:50:33,285 --> 00:50:36,725
Speaker 6:  everything I just heard an hour ago. And neither of them are necessarily

845
00:50:36,725 --> 00:50:39,925
Speaker 6:  wrong. Well we are in Bitcoin. They were probably both wrong.

846
00:50:40,785 --> 00:50:41,845
Speaker 6:  But other than that it was great.

847
00:50:42,145 --> 00:50:45,485
Speaker 4:  No, I think you're right. And I think one of the actually most encouraging

848
00:50:45,485 --> 00:50:48,565
Speaker 4:  things I found doing all this research was that we're in kind of a weird

849
00:50:48,565 --> 00:50:52,525
Speaker 4:  time in the entertainment business in general. pwc the like accounting and

850
00:50:52,525 --> 00:50:55,605
Speaker 4:  consulting firm, they do a really interesting like state of the entertainment

851
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:59,925
Speaker 4:  business thing every year. And the basic takeaway for, I think this

852
00:50:59,925 --> 00:51:03,685
Speaker 4:  year's was 23 through 27, so sort of the next five years

853
00:51:03,905 --> 00:51:07,685
Speaker 4:  was kind of the outlook. And basically the overarching theory is like the

854
00:51:07,685 --> 00:51:11,605
Speaker 4:  entertainment businesses weird and messy and growth is going down

855
00:51:11,605 --> 00:51:15,325
Speaker 4:  in a lot of ways except for gaming, which just against all Odds

856
00:51:15,645 --> 00:51:19,125
Speaker 4:  continues to grow along. Basically every axis you can think of like

857
00:51:19,435 --> 00:51:23,325
Speaker 4:  more people are coming into gaming. They had this fun stat that like people

858
00:51:23,325 --> 00:51:27,125
Speaker 4:  over 45 are one of the fastest growing groups of gamers right now. Mm.

859
00:51:27,505 --> 00:51:31,485
Speaker 4:  So are women, so are young girls. Like it's a, it's a, every faction of

860
00:51:31,485 --> 00:51:35,205
Speaker 4:  people you can think of are increasingly gaming. And what that means is

861
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:39,525
Speaker 4:  probably that like a handful of big things get even bigger over time.

862
00:51:39,595 --> 00:51:42,085
Speaker 4:  Like a lot of these people are gonna show up and play Call of Duty, that's

863
00:51:42,085 --> 00:51:45,925
Speaker 4:  fine, but it also does mean just the pie gets so much bigger that

864
00:51:45,925 --> 00:51:49,405
Speaker 4:  it's just gonna allow for a lot more things. But all of that being said,

865
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:53,085
Speaker 4:  I think it is still going to be true for a long time that a handful

866
00:51:53,305 --> 00:51:56,925
Speaker 4:  of companies and properties run this

867
00:51:57,245 --> 00:52:01,045
Speaker 4:  business in a pretty real way. Like Call of Duty is going to continue

868
00:52:01,045 --> 00:52:04,925
Speaker 4:  to be a bellwether for a lot of things in a way

869
00:52:04,925 --> 00:52:06,085
Speaker 4:  that most things are not.

870
00:52:06,785 --> 00:52:10,645
Speaker 6:  Yes, I think that's right. I think we can know for a fact

871
00:52:10,675 --> 00:52:14,645
Speaker 6:  that Grand Theft Auto will make a lot of money and it will be absolutely

872
00:52:14,845 --> 00:52:18,645
Speaker 6:  humongous and Take two will be okay because of it. We can know for a fact

873
00:52:18,675 --> 00:52:22,605
Speaker 6:  that FIFA now EA Football Club or whatever

874
00:52:22,605 --> 00:52:23,005
Speaker 6:  they call it,

875
00:52:23,405 --> 00:52:25,685
Speaker 4:  EA Sports fc, the worst named video game of all time.

876
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:29,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It, it's gonna keep ea just afloat enough for them to continue

877
00:52:29,645 --> 00:52:33,045
Speaker 6:  to try to figure out how to make mass effects Excel. Again, what is

878
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,725
Speaker 6:  confusing is like will ea be as big as it once was?

879
00:52:37,245 --> 00:52:40,925
Speaker 6:  I don't know. Will UV Soft be as big as it once

880
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:44,925
Speaker 6:  was? don don't know. Will new players rise in

881
00:52:44,925 --> 00:52:48,805
Speaker 6:  their place like Epic with Fortnite and You know Publishing Remedy?

882
00:52:49,765 --> 00:52:53,525
Speaker 6:  Probably So I think you're right. The big differences that just

883
00:52:53,705 --> 00:52:57,685
Speaker 6:  who those people are might change in the same way that You

884
00:52:57,685 --> 00:53:01,405
Speaker 6:  know Capcom. If you had asked me about this 10 years ago or

885
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:05,045
Speaker 6:  Sega, I would be like, what are you talking about? Sure. And if you asked

886
00:53:05,045 --> 00:53:08,885
Speaker 6:  me about Capcom and Sega today, I'd be like, they do no wrong. They, they

887
00:53:09,205 --> 00:53:12,685
Speaker 6:  continue to make, well Capcom has a really good streak right now. Sega,

888
00:53:13,745 --> 00:53:17,205
Speaker 6:  it depends. It can go back and forth. Or if you had told me that Konami would

889
00:53:17,205 --> 00:53:20,845
Speaker 6:  not have put out games really for a while and that Bandi

890
00:53:20,975 --> 00:53:24,925
Speaker 6:  Namco would be huge now none of these things were

891
00:53:25,025 --> 00:53:28,925
Speaker 6:  the things I could have predicted and yet now arguing against Elden

892
00:53:28,925 --> 00:53:31,685
Speaker 6:  Ring as anything but one of the biggest games in the world Sounds silly.

893
00:53:32,035 --> 00:53:35,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You know I, and I think that applies to the game franchise as well.

894
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:39,605
Speaker 5:  You know people didn't have much understanding of what

895
00:53:39,605 --> 00:53:43,525
Speaker 5:  Minecraft was gonna be when Minecraft launched. And the fact that it is

896
00:53:43,525 --> 00:53:47,325
Speaker 5:  now a worldwide property that was originally made by a very, very, very small

897
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:51,045
Speaker 5:  team tells you that it is possible that is like the

898
00:53:51,155 --> 00:53:55,085
Speaker 5:  jackpot of jackpots. There's really no scenario where anyone would ever bet

899
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:59,005
Speaker 5:  the likelihood of that happening. But it is possible for new franchises to

900
00:53:59,005 --> 00:54:02,965
Speaker 5:  get in there. It's just very, very rare. It's like a once every five

901
00:54:03,135 --> 00:54:06,925
Speaker 5:  years kind of thing if that. So yeah, I mean I,

902
00:54:06,985 --> 00:54:10,725
Speaker 5:  you will see movement, but again, I You know so long as you're not

903
00:54:10,815 --> 00:54:14,765
Speaker 5:  super hyper-focused on the large business side of

904
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:17,765
Speaker 5:  it and if you're just sitting at home and you wanna play cool games, the,

905
00:54:17,765 --> 00:54:21,365
Speaker 5:  it's never been better for that. Like it is literally

906
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,565
Speaker 5:  so diverse and you have so many options and

907
00:54:25,955 --> 00:54:29,805
Speaker 5:  from a like inexpensive nature like playing

908
00:54:29,805 --> 00:54:32,845
Speaker 5:  games and being into games pretty damn cheap for what you're getting out

909
00:54:32,845 --> 00:54:36,765
Speaker 5:  of it, like the ROI is incredible. So I think it is kind

910
00:54:36,765 --> 00:54:40,525
Speaker 5:  of a great time, as you said for the audience to really grow and

911
00:54:40,525 --> 00:54:42,565
Speaker 5:  become bigger and more welcoming. Can

912
00:54:42,565 --> 00:54:45,485
Speaker 6:  I just tell you the unfair thing about video game culture? The one thing

913
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:48,325
Speaker 6:  just, just the, this is actually the only one, the only issue I have. I've

914
00:54:48,325 --> 00:54:52,285
Speaker 6:  never actually had any concerns and, and that's well documented that freshmen

915
00:54:52,315 --> 00:54:56,125
Speaker 6:  Minecraft and I can say something like I

916
00:54:56,345 --> 00:55:00,325
Speaker 6:  played the original build of Minecraft when it was in a forum

917
00:55:00,705 --> 00:55:04,685
Speaker 6:  and I say that out loud and I sound like the biggest asshole and

918
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:05,885
Speaker 6:  nobody thinks it's cool.

919
00:55:06,305 --> 00:55:08,045
Speaker 4:  You also sound like you're 200 years

920
00:55:08,065 --> 00:55:11,885
Speaker 6:  Old. I do. But if I said something like I saw those lovely

921
00:55:12,035 --> 00:55:15,965
Speaker 6:  boys in Liverpool at a little bar down the street and

922
00:55:15,965 --> 00:55:19,485
Speaker 6:  then they went on to become the Beatles, people would be like, holy moly,

923
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:23,605
Speaker 6:  that's incredible. And don don't know what that is. There's something,

924
00:55:23,605 --> 00:55:27,405
Speaker 6:  there's maybe it's just game history that that was still of a dork era

925
00:55:27,595 --> 00:55:30,845
Speaker 6:  that people are like, yeah, that just means that you're around in a dork

926
00:55:30,865 --> 00:55:34,605
Speaker 6:  at that time. You know pip squeak and give you a swirly. Chris,

927
00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:36,165
Speaker 4:  I just want you to know I think you're impressive.

928
00:55:36,415 --> 00:55:39,805
Speaker 6:  Thank you. Honestly, I just wanted praise and I got it. I'm

929
00:55:39,805 --> 00:55:42,685
Speaker 4:  So proud of you. I could not Thank you. I couldn't even begin to tell you.

930
00:55:42,825 --> 00:55:45,365
Speaker 6:  You might think that it doesn't work, but it does. I do feel better.

931
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:48,805
Speaker 4:  I am. Listen, I'm proud of you. You were early to, you were, you were early.

932
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:51,365
Speaker 4:  Whatcha are you gonna do? You were the first one. You get to be a Minecraft

933
00:55:51,365 --> 00:55:52,965
Speaker 4:  hipster. Congratulations. Yeah.

934
00:55:53,345 --> 00:55:56,285
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna cut this recording out and then just listen to it every morning

935
00:55:56,285 --> 00:55:57,165
Speaker 6:  when I wake up. Here we go.

936
00:55:57,305 --> 00:55:59,645
Speaker 4:  All. right? We need to take one more quick break and then I have one more

937
00:55:59,645 --> 00:56:02,165
Speaker 4:  theory that we've kind of already talked about and then I have some questions

938
00:56:02,165 --> 00:56:04,085
Speaker 4:  for you and then we're gonna get outta here. We'll right back.

952
00:57:04,765 --> 00:57:07,665
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. My last theory we've basically already talked about,

953
00:57:07,665 --> 00:57:10,305
Speaker 4:  but I'm just gonna like put a couple of pieces together very quickly for

954
00:57:10,305 --> 00:57:13,905
Speaker 4:  you. And this is what I call the music industry theory, which is basically

955
00:57:13,905 --> 00:57:17,785
Speaker 4:  that instead of a radical change in content, the first thing

956
00:57:17,785 --> 00:57:21,705
Speaker 4:  we're gonna get is a new kind of consumer product that is actually

957
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:25,585
Speaker 4:  then going to back into changing all of the content. And I think the two

958
00:57:25,585 --> 00:57:28,625
Speaker 4:  versions of that, both of which we've talked about a little bit are Game

959
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:32,065
Speaker 4:  Pass and things like it. This idea that you pay one price for lots of games

960
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:35,945
Speaker 4:  instead of buying games individually and live services games, which is

961
00:57:35,945 --> 00:57:39,665
Speaker 4:  just a completely different way of monetizing a game that functionally

962
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:43,305
Speaker 4:  changes. Like you were talking about Russ, what those games are and how they're

963
00:57:43,305 --> 00:57:47,265
Speaker 4:  made and maintained over time. So I think in this case Game Pass is

964
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:50,665
Speaker 4:  probably the more relevant one to like us right now at this moment because

965
00:57:50,665 --> 00:57:53,665
Speaker 4:  what we haven't seen is what that will mean for how games get made. Whereas

966
00:57:53,825 --> 00:57:57,225
Speaker 4:  I feel like the live services answer is just obvious, right? Like if

967
00:57:57,365 --> 00:58:00,865
Speaker 4:  Microtransactions changed how games got made like that, that just exists

968
00:58:00,925 --> 00:58:04,105
Speaker 4:  in the world now. I don't think that's arguable anymore, but I do think the,

969
00:58:04,165 --> 00:58:08,105
Speaker 4:  the question of like, is the way that we buy and pay for games going to change

970
00:58:08,105 --> 00:58:11,265
Speaker 4:  the games themselves is still kind of in the middle of being sorted out.

971
00:58:11,865 --> 00:58:15,065
Speaker 5:  I actually think that Game Pass is already

972
00:58:15,545 --> 00:58:18,145
Speaker 5:  determining how some games get made really?

973
00:58:18,215 --> 00:58:18,505
Speaker 4:  Okay.

974
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:22,505
Speaker 5:  It's, I think it's already happening. I think there are three hour narrative

975
00:58:22,505 --> 00:58:26,425
Speaker 5:  games that would not exist if a Pitch wasn't green

976
00:58:26,485 --> 00:58:30,425
Speaker 5:  lit by Microsoft and said, okay, oh this is

977
00:58:30,425 --> 00:58:33,705
Speaker 5:  great. We love what you're doing and here's this like cute little walkthrough

978
00:58:33,945 --> 00:58:37,505
Speaker 5:  of it and, and we're into it, it's gonna come to Game Pass. But

979
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:41,265
Speaker 5:  ordinarily that three hour narrative game would really struggle on Steam

980
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:45,025
Speaker 5:  or another platform and Game Pass is the solve and the way that it kind of

981
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:45,785
Speaker 5:  reaches all the people.

982
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,465
Speaker 4:  Chris, you, you were pointing during that, I'm assuming you liked this theory.

983
00:58:48,585 --> 00:58:49,185
Speaker 4:  I was waiting

984
00:58:49,185 --> 00:58:52,065
Speaker 6:  For Fresh to say my game of the year from last year

985
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:56,625
Speaker 6:  Intimate. It was made within the Xbox family. This is an

986
00:58:56,635 --> 00:59:00,505
Speaker 6:  indie game. But what happened is Obsidian who

987
00:59:00,765 --> 00:59:04,665
Speaker 6:  has made very, very large role playing games decided

988
00:59:05,155 --> 00:59:08,825
Speaker 6:  let's make a book about the 16th century.

989
00:59:09,405 --> 00:59:13,305
Speaker 6:  And when I say a book, I meant video game, but that was a hell of a fian

990
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:17,345
Speaker 6:  slip because it was really just a game that

991
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:21,225
Speaker 6:  you read a lot about. You are an illuminator.

992
00:59:21,505 --> 00:59:24,845
Speaker 6:  So like the person who made like You know texts look beautiful

993
00:59:25,865 --> 00:59:28,925
Speaker 6:  way, way back in the day. And then there's kind of like a murder mystery

994
00:59:28,925 --> 00:59:32,605
Speaker 6:  that happens. It is a slow game. It is a deeply

995
00:59:32,775 --> 00:59:36,525
Speaker 6:  thoughtful game. It is a religious and spiritual

996
00:59:36,555 --> 00:59:40,485
Speaker 6:  game. It would've never ever been

997
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:44,445
Speaker 6:  made within the Xbox system without Game Pass. And Xbox made a

998
00:59:44,445 --> 00:59:47,965
Speaker 6:  lot of indie games where there is a huge difference between limbo and

999
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:52,165
Speaker 6:  ment. And I think Xbox proving that

1000
00:59:52,305 --> 00:59:55,645
Speaker 6:  is showing like, hey, this is something that we're looking to do inside.

1001
00:59:56,045 --> 00:59:58,965
Speaker 6:  I think that they are doing it. I think there's a lot of reasons for them

1002
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:02,525
Speaker 6:  to do that. I think that is a great way to retain talent because

1003
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:06,125
Speaker 6:  how often in the past would it be like, well this person made all their money

1004
01:00:06,545 --> 01:00:10,365
Speaker 6:  and now they're gonna leave and go make intimate because they can and being

1005
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:13,045
Speaker 6:  able to say, Hey You know what, stay here. We'll keep you paid, we'll hit

1006
01:00:13,045 --> 01:00:15,485
Speaker 6:  take care of your health insurance and you can just make it here. I think

1007
01:00:15,485 --> 01:00:19,205
Speaker 6:  that's encouraging. I think it also is a great way for them to test out

1008
01:00:19,205 --> 01:00:23,005
Speaker 6:  ideas. Playing a game like Intimate, you can feel a lot

1009
01:00:23,105 --> 01:00:27,005
Speaker 6:  of the groundwork for probably much larger games that this studio

1010
01:00:27,035 --> 01:00:30,525
Speaker 6:  will do in the future. So it creates I think a healthier ecosystem

1011
01:00:30,905 --> 01:00:34,885
Speaker 6:  at these very large companies. Fresh mentioned really earlier

1012
01:00:34,985 --> 01:00:38,885
Speaker 6:  in this Dave, the diver at Nexon being You know

1013
01:00:39,245 --> 01:00:43,205
Speaker 6:  mistaken for an indie game. But I think it's telling that Nexon would

1014
01:00:43,235 --> 01:00:46,725
Speaker 6:  want to try to create something like that and have that as part of their

1015
01:00:46,725 --> 01:00:50,685
Speaker 6:  portfolio. It it's feels crass and you have to say like

1016
01:00:50,825 --> 01:00:54,085
Speaker 6:  as part of a portfolio. But again, at the end of the day, these are businesses

1017
01:00:54,085 --> 01:00:58,005
Speaker 6:  and they're balancing these needs. I am more curious what

1018
01:00:58,005 --> 01:01:01,885
Speaker 6:  this means for studios that are not owned by a major publisher though

1019
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:06,405
Speaker 6:  and are like, how will they start designing games towards Game Pass?

1020
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:10,365
Speaker 6:  Especially if they don't have a contract before they You know start

1021
01:01:10,435 --> 01:01:10,725
Speaker 6:  work.

1022
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:14,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's worth noting don don't think there's a scenario, especially in

1023
01:01:14,365 --> 01:01:18,285
Speaker 5:  those external cases where they don't kind of

1024
01:01:18,285 --> 01:01:22,005
Speaker 5:  start with a, a representation of what the project's gonna be and Pitch to

1025
01:01:22,205 --> 01:01:25,125
Speaker 5:  Microsoft and say, Hey, here's what the game is. So no one's starting from

1026
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:28,845
Speaker 5:  zero zero to get on game bass. But I do agree, I think those pitches are

1027
01:01:28,995 --> 01:01:31,805
Speaker 5:  altered by game has simply existing.

1028
01:01:32,195 --> 01:01:35,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's like the, the I, it just always makes me think about the, the

1029
01:01:35,085 --> 01:01:38,685
Speaker 4:  thing on Netflix where like every Netflix miniseries is like two episodes

1030
01:01:38,685 --> 01:01:41,645
Speaker 4:  too long because they're, they're very interested in the idea of getting

1031
01:01:41,645 --> 01:01:44,325
Speaker 4:  you to watch as long as possible because that's what success looks like.

1032
01:01:44,585 --> 01:01:48,005
Speaker 4:  And so every, every movie is 30 minutes too long and every

1033
01:01:48,055 --> 01:01:51,925
Speaker 4:  miniseries is two episodes too long. And part of that is just a

1034
01:01:52,085 --> 01:01:55,165
Speaker 4:  function of what the system is, right? It's, it's the incentives, it's how

1035
01:01:55,165 --> 01:01:59,045
Speaker 4:  people experience these things. It's what gets you in the door. And I

1036
01:01:59,045 --> 01:02:02,765
Speaker 4:  think in games that will do some really interesting stuff just in the same

1037
01:02:02,765 --> 01:02:05,245
Speaker 4:  way that like the app stores is another recent example of this, right? Like

1038
01:02:05,245 --> 01:02:09,045
Speaker 4:  the app store changed the way that people thought about paying for games

1039
01:02:09,045 --> 01:02:12,725
Speaker 4:  because it pretty quickly everybody decided that you can't put a $70 game

1040
01:02:12,725 --> 01:02:16,645
Speaker 4:  in the app store. Whether that was a good decision historically or let us

1041
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:19,725
Speaker 4:  down a bunch of really horrible roads we can debate. But then that changed

1042
01:02:19,765 --> 01:02:21,925
Speaker 4:  a bunch of games and that's where a lot of the free to play stuff started

1043
01:02:21,925 --> 01:02:24,885
Speaker 4:  to come from and like our, our loot boxes started to become the thing and

1044
01:02:25,465 --> 01:02:28,645
Speaker 4:  it changed Apple Services business and like you spiral all of that out of

1045
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:32,365
Speaker 4:  this like one how it monetizes decision in really

1046
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:36,205
Speaker 4:  messy ways. It also led to a lot of awful, awful crap

1047
01:02:36,345 --> 01:02:39,965
Speaker 4:  on the app store that is just designed to con you into paying for stuff you

1048
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:43,685
Speaker 4:  don't actually want. And my fear for something like Game Pass would be that

1049
01:02:43,685 --> 01:02:47,525
Speaker 4:  like if not properly curated, it will turn into something like

1050
01:02:47,525 --> 01:02:50,725
Speaker 4:  that too. Like I think all the time about Spotify's thing where there are

1051
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:54,045
Speaker 4:  all these white noise podcasts on Spotify making a ton of money

1052
01:02:54,435 --> 01:02:58,285
Speaker 4:  because the way that they make money is by getting you

1053
01:02:58,285 --> 01:03:02,005
Speaker 4:  to play stuff for a long period of time and if you play a 12 hour noise podcast

1054
01:03:02,225 --> 01:03:06,045
Speaker 4:  for eight hours, that's gonna make the podcast some money even

1055
01:03:06,045 --> 01:03:08,965
Speaker 4:  though it's just white noise. And so that's just like, it's a little way

1056
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:11,845
Speaker 4:  of breaking the incentive structure that I think there are gonna be ways

1057
01:03:11,845 --> 01:03:15,285
Speaker 4:  to do that in games that are gonna be ugly and it's gonna be interesting

1058
01:03:15,285 --> 01:03:18,325
Speaker 4:  to see Microsoft and others try to not let that happen.

1059
01:03:18,715 --> 01:03:21,765
Speaker 5:  What is good is that because you have to pay for Game Pass,

1060
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:26,445
Speaker 5:  Microsoft really can't put free to play games on Game Pass 'cause those are

1061
01:03:26,445 --> 01:03:30,085
Speaker 5:  free. Yeah. So at least you can avoid that. There are games on there

1062
01:03:30,355 --> 01:03:34,245
Speaker 5:  that have monetization elements where you can buy skins or whatever it

1063
01:03:34,245 --> 01:03:38,205
Speaker 5:  is, even though it is on Game Pass. Broadly speaking, that's not the case.

1064
01:03:38,355 --> 01:03:41,405
Speaker 5:  Most of the games that are on there are like pretty full games to begin with.

1065
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:45,445
Speaker 5:  But I do think having that small barrier to entry of payment

1066
01:03:46,165 --> 01:03:48,525
Speaker 5:  actually makes a huge difference. Apple Arcade is the other representation

1067
01:03:48,545 --> 01:03:52,005
Speaker 5:  of that where none of those games have monetization built in because

1068
01:03:52,315 --> 01:03:53,885
Speaker 5:  they're already getting the money up front

1069
01:03:54,545 --> 01:03:58,445
Speaker 6:  And both of them are also retailers. So

1070
01:03:58,565 --> 01:04:02,085
Speaker 6:  I, it's the difference between like Netflix and Amazon Amazon Prime, right?

1071
01:04:02,175 --> 01:04:06,125
Speaker 6:  Where Netflix doesn't also sell the movies so they just try to get as

1072
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:09,885
Speaker 6:  much as possible within Netflix. But I feel like in both the Game Pass

1073
01:04:10,025 --> 01:04:13,965
Speaker 6:  and Apple Arcade case, you can have chaos, you can have

1074
01:04:14,405 --> 01:04:18,205
Speaker 6:  thousands of options go buy 'em. But when part of the

1075
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:21,725
Speaker 6:  sale of joining these services is the curation

1076
01:04:22,265 --> 01:04:24,485
Speaker 6:  You know you're only going to get the quote PEs to the best.

1077
01:04:24,985 --> 01:04:27,925
Speaker 4:  No, I think that's right. And I think in if that holds, it can lead to some

1078
01:04:27,925 --> 01:04:31,765
Speaker 4:  very cool things and again is another kind of thing that can open up lots

1079
01:04:31,765 --> 01:04:34,365
Speaker 4:  of discovery and different avenues for doing different kinds of stuff because

1080
01:04:34,385 --> 01:04:37,525
Speaker 4:  you don't just have to bet on the stuff that You know works because you have

1081
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:40,445
Speaker 4:  other ways to put it in front of people. I think that's very cool. Alright,

1082
01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:43,325
Speaker 4:  it sounds like all my theories are true. I feel great about this. I I crushed

1083
01:04:43,325 --> 01:04:44,485
Speaker 4:  this research project. You

1084
01:04:44,485 --> 01:04:45,885
Speaker 5:  Did so well. I'm really proud

1085
01:04:45,885 --> 01:04:46,165
Speaker 6:  Of you.

1086
01:04:46,645 --> 01:04:50,205
Speaker 4:  I have three questions for the two of you that I have not successfully answered

1087
01:04:50,465 --> 01:04:53,485
Speaker 4:  in any way, shape or form by talking to people and that you guys have brought

1088
01:04:53,485 --> 01:04:56,205
Speaker 4:  up and I wanna talk about it and then we're gonna get outta here. The first

1089
01:04:56,405 --> 01:05:00,365
Speaker 4:  question is, is the $70 price tag for

1090
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:04,365
Speaker 4:  a game gonna last? Can that hold? I see people who are furious about it.

1091
01:05:04,365 --> 01:05:07,565
Speaker 4:  I see people who are like, actually that's an

1092
01:05:07,755 --> 01:05:11,325
Speaker 4:  undersell for what some of these games are worth. Like is that, is that sustainable

1093
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:12,125
Speaker 4:  in the gaming industry?

1094
01:05:12,355 --> 01:05:16,005
Speaker 5:  Certainly not gonna go down. Yeah. Like it's, it's, it's at

1095
01:05:16,005 --> 01:05:19,805
Speaker 5:  $70 now for You know quote, next gen games. Obviously

1096
01:05:19,805 --> 01:05:23,285
Speaker 5:  smaller games can be cheaper than that, but yeah, that, I think that will

1097
01:05:23,355 --> 01:05:27,325
Speaker 5:  stay. But I also think some games, if you're

1098
01:05:27,325 --> 01:05:31,205
Speaker 5:  gonna spend Hell Elden Ring perfect example. I played Elden Ring for

1099
01:05:31,205 --> 01:05:34,805
Speaker 5:  150 hours, easily worth, I think it was

1100
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:39,045
Speaker 5:  try $60 when it came out, easily worth that $60. I'd pay

1101
01:05:39,085 --> 01:05:42,525
Speaker 5:  a hundred dollars and be happy. So yeah, I I I think

1102
01:05:43,025 --> 01:05:46,045
Speaker 5:  it is sustainable insofar as it's not gonna come down from that.

1103
01:05:46,645 --> 01:05:49,965
Speaker 6:  I also think we're seeing more variety of pricing

1104
01:05:50,305 --> 01:05:53,885
Speaker 6:  across the landscape. You know Assassin's Creed Mirage didn't cost

1105
01:05:53,965 --> 01:05:57,925
Speaker 6:  $70. Yeah. And yet it's the Ubisoft's big game. There's, I I

1106
01:05:57,925 --> 01:06:01,205
Speaker 6:  think it's never great to have to pay more money for things, but

1107
01:06:01,795 --> 01:06:05,325
Speaker 6:  also the pricing of video games has been a disaster for

1108
01:06:05,585 --> 01:06:09,325
Speaker 6:  two decades. And how that has been

1109
01:06:09,325 --> 01:06:12,805
Speaker 6:  addressed has been everything from Horse Armor, You know to

1110
01:06:13,175 --> 01:06:16,685
Speaker 6:  other DLC and, and the studios are always trying to figure out like,

1111
01:06:17,225 --> 01:06:20,885
Speaker 6:  how are we going to make this work? The

1112
01:06:21,165 --> 01:06:24,765
Speaker 6:  industry is a bit more financially perilous than I think sometimes people

1113
01:06:24,765 --> 01:06:28,085
Speaker 6:  give it credit for. That's not to say that there aren't CEOs taking just

1114
01:06:28,545 --> 01:06:32,405
Speaker 6:  absurd paydays and that there is a better ways to run these businesses,

1115
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:36,405
Speaker 6:  but even with that, the sheer cost to make a game

1116
01:06:37,105 --> 01:06:40,405
Speaker 6:  is just getting higher and higher and the risk associated with it is getting

1117
01:06:40,405 --> 01:06:41,085
Speaker 6:  higher. With that,

1118
01:06:41,675 --> 01:06:45,605
Speaker 5:  What I would also add is go back and find copies of like the Toys or US

1119
01:06:45,965 --> 01:06:49,925
Speaker 5:  magazine from when the Super Nintendo launched and you will see the

1120
01:06:49,925 --> 01:06:53,525
Speaker 5:  prices were like pretty much in line with the prices we see today,

1121
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:57,405
Speaker 5:  sometimes even over back then. So really game prices

1122
01:06:57,475 --> 01:07:01,405
Speaker 5:  have not kept up with inflation in the way that other industries like movie

1123
01:07:01,405 --> 01:07:02,005
Speaker 5:  tickets have

1124
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:06,005
Speaker 6:  Though we have Verge listeners, so we will recognize that is because it

1125
01:07:06,005 --> 01:07:09,925
Speaker 6:  is cartridges with chips inside and it costs more

1126
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:12,885
Speaker 6:  to actually make them than discs. We recognize all of it. I'm just saying

1127
01:07:13,165 --> 01:07:17,045
Speaker 6:  I could, I could feel, I could feel people tensing their hands around

1128
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:20,805
Speaker 6:  their steering wheel being like, am I gonna just drive right off the edge?

1129
01:07:21,605 --> 01:07:24,965
Speaker 5:  Companies will charge exactly what they think they can charge and still make

1130
01:07:24,965 --> 01:07:25,645
Speaker 5:  money. And

1131
01:07:25,645 --> 01:07:28,805
Speaker 4:  I will say it's, there is really no historical precedent for that number

1132
01:07:28,805 --> 01:07:32,645
Speaker 4:  going down. I think you're right. Okay. I'm gonna combine my last two questions

1133
01:07:32,645 --> 01:07:36,445
Speaker 4:  into one question, which is what the hell is the deal with GTA six?

1134
01:07:37,005 --> 01:07:40,205
Speaker 4:  I I, I have talked to so many people and done so much research on this and

1135
01:07:40,205 --> 01:07:43,965
Speaker 4:  there is this thing that is happening where the news of a

1136
01:07:44,525 --> 01:07:47,805
Speaker 4:  possible forthcoming trailer for GTA six was like

1137
01:07:48,455 --> 01:07:52,405
Speaker 4:  Nationwide News. GTA five is like a good game. It's very old,

1138
01:07:52,405 --> 01:07:56,245
Speaker 4:  it's very popular. Grand Theft Auto is not like by an order of

1139
01:07:56,525 --> 01:07:59,365
Speaker 4:  magnitude, the biggest game on planet earth, but there is something about

1140
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:02,805
Speaker 4:  this game coming we think next year, right?

1141
01:08:02,805 --> 01:08:06,605
Speaker 4:  2024 that is different. Like what is the deal with this

1142
01:08:06,605 --> 01:08:06,805
Speaker 4:  game?

1143
01:08:07,325 --> 01:08:11,205
Speaker 5:  I mean, I would look to, when Grand Theft oh five came out that year,

1144
01:08:11,745 --> 01:08:15,725
Speaker 5:  it was a guaranteed lock solid, no question about it. It biggest

1145
01:08:15,755 --> 01:08:19,525
Speaker 5:  Game of the Year by a mile and it's continued to make a ton of money

1146
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:22,325
Speaker 5:  over the course of the last decade because of

1147
01:08:22,885 --> 01:08:24,565
Speaker 5:  monetization, GTA online stuff.

1148
01:08:24,825 --> 01:08:27,205
Speaker 4:  So maybe I'm underwriting how big GTA really is.

1149
01:08:27,505 --> 01:08:31,365
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah, big time. There are very few games, and this is applies

1150
01:08:31,365 --> 01:08:35,245
Speaker 5:  to like Call of Duty as well, very few games in the world that

1151
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:39,325
Speaker 5:  You know for sure are going to totally dominate the

1152
01:08:39,325 --> 01:08:41,685
Speaker 5:  sales of a given year and GTA is one of them.

1153
01:08:42,075 --> 01:08:45,725
Speaker 4:  What if it sucks? Like, is is there any remote

1154
01:08:45,725 --> 01:08:48,565
Speaker 4:  possibility that this just like isn't a good game? It's been a long time.

1155
01:08:49,145 --> 01:08:49,605
Speaker 4:  Oh sure,

1156
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:53,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They've had some turnover with staff. It, it's certainly possible.

1157
01:08:53,685 --> 01:08:57,485
Speaker 5:  I mean we've seen You know cyberpunk. Everyone was so sure that

1158
01:08:57,485 --> 01:09:00,685
Speaker 5:  that game was gonna come out and be incredible because Witcher was amazing

1159
01:09:00,745 --> 01:09:04,285
Speaker 5:  and that studio does amazing work broadly speaking and, and it came out and

1160
01:09:04,285 --> 01:09:08,045
Speaker 5:  obviously wasn't. So it's always possible. I do think, and I brought this

1161
01:09:08,045 --> 01:09:11,485
Speaker 5:  up earlier, I do think because of the Cyberpunks of the world,

1162
01:09:11,865 --> 01:09:15,485
Speaker 5:  if there was a chance that it was gonna come out and be a total disaster,

1163
01:09:15,915 --> 01:09:19,365
Speaker 5:  they would hold it. They would not put it out because the amount that they've

1164
01:09:19,365 --> 01:09:23,285
Speaker 5:  already sunk into it would not allow them to eat the

1165
01:09:23,285 --> 01:09:25,565
Speaker 5:  amount of shit that they would have to eat if it came out and was a disaster.

1166
01:09:25,825 --> 01:09:28,965
Speaker 4:  That's fair. Chris, I remember in one of our first

1167
01:09:29,235 --> 01:09:32,885
Speaker 4:  conversations about this series, one of the questions you floated was

1168
01:09:33,555 --> 01:09:37,525
Speaker 4:  what if GTA six is the last AAA game? I I, I think it

1169
01:09:37,525 --> 01:09:41,245
Speaker 4:  won't be, but I think there is something about this

1170
01:09:41,245 --> 01:09:45,085
Speaker 4:  moment and this game that feels don don't know Inflective.

1171
01:09:45,385 --> 01:09:48,645
Speaker 4:  Is that a thing like at, at an inflection point? Can you be I don, whatever?

1172
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:51,725
Speaker 4:  It feels like a moment in the broader gaming world too.

1173
01:09:52,305 --> 01:09:56,245
Speaker 6:  It is because it always is bigger. Every GTA game

1174
01:09:56,265 --> 01:10:00,085
Speaker 6:  is bigger than what we thought possible. I remember when I played GTA five

1175
01:10:00,085 --> 01:10:03,805
Speaker 6:  for the first time on the Xbox 360 and it felt like the dark arts,

1176
01:10:04,225 --> 01:10:07,885
Speaker 6:  it felt like it should not be running on that hardware. And it was just so

1177
01:10:08,335 --> 01:10:12,045
Speaker 6:  grand in scope and ambition whether or not it's even good, it's just

1178
01:10:12,385 --> 01:10:16,165
Speaker 6:  big. It's funny since we talked about that, I actually dug up an

1179
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:20,085
Speaker 6:  old story and it's telling that I can't even remember if it was during GTA

1180
01:10:20,085 --> 01:10:23,405
Speaker 6:  four's launch or GTA's Five's launch, which was by

1181
01:10:24,285 --> 01:10:27,725
Speaker 6:  somebody who was saying just that this is the end of AAA games. It can't

1182
01:10:27,725 --> 01:10:31,485
Speaker 6:  get any bigger than this. It's not sustainable. We'll never

1183
01:10:31,545 --> 01:10:35,405
Speaker 6:  see anything like this ever. And like obviously that was not the

1184
01:10:35,405 --> 01:10:39,365
Speaker 6:  case that said we are in a different point in the industry than

1185
01:10:39,365 --> 01:10:42,965
Speaker 6:  we were when GTA five and even GTA four came out. Everything we just

1186
01:10:43,165 --> 01:10:46,685
Speaker 6:  discussed before this, there is more variety and more choice.

1187
01:10:47,095 --> 01:10:50,645
Speaker 6:  There are not just the single player games, it's people

1188
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:55,205
Speaker 6:  might forget the GTA five with online. Online came

1189
01:10:55,205 --> 01:10:59,045
Speaker 6:  later and broken and it took a while to like get, get itself up and

1190
01:10:59,045 --> 01:11:02,925
Speaker 6:  running. And now either online is an entirely separate game or

1191
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:06,485
Speaker 6:  it It works at the beginning it's gonna be one or the other, but we're not

1192
01:11:06,485 --> 01:11:10,085
Speaker 6:  gonna see that that happen again. So yeah, I

1193
01:11:11,045 --> 01:11:14,685
Speaker 6:  I don't think it's the last AAA game, but I do think

1194
01:11:14,905 --> 01:11:18,765
Speaker 6:  it will feel different than anything that we've seen before it.

1195
01:11:19,305 --> 01:11:23,205
Speaker 5:  And I also think the wait for GTA seven might be even

1196
01:11:23,205 --> 01:11:27,085
Speaker 5:  longer because they've realized how much money they can make building

1197
01:11:27,245 --> 01:11:30,765
Speaker 5:  a really sustainable online system with monetization built in that

1198
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:35,205
Speaker 5:  this feels like the launch of a live service game as much as it is

1199
01:11:35,685 --> 01:11:39,165
Speaker 5:  a single player campaign where you You know commit crimes. So

1200
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:43,325
Speaker 5:  yeah, it's gonna be a big deal and it's gonna be a game that we're gonna

1201
01:11:43,325 --> 01:11:46,845
Speaker 5:  be all living with for easily a decade, if not 15,

1202
01:11:47,225 --> 01:11:48,285
Speaker 5:  who knows? 20. Can

1203
01:11:48,285 --> 01:11:51,845
Speaker 6:  I tell you my ridiculous GTA seven theory? Yes. GTA seven

1204
01:11:52,465 --> 01:11:56,325
Speaker 6:  is gonna be the return to New York and they're obvi. They've already

1205
01:11:56,325 --> 01:11:59,685
Speaker 6:  spoken a lot about their interest in AI and generative tech

1206
01:12:00,345 --> 01:12:03,885
Speaker 6:  and I don't think they, they do GTA seven unless you can go in buildings

1207
01:12:03,905 --> 01:12:07,565
Speaker 6:  in New York, which would be just an absolute absurd

1208
01:12:07,995 --> 01:12:11,845
Speaker 6:  idea. But I don don't know. I I'm curious like

1209
01:12:11,955 --> 01:12:15,765
Speaker 6:  what the big turn is as they, as we look

1210
01:12:16,025 --> 01:12:19,885
Speaker 6:  You know 15 years out from now, what are they thinking about?

1211
01:12:20,105 --> 01:12:22,725
Speaker 5:  Hey, hey Chris Plant we've played it. Guess what? We've played that game

1212
01:12:22,725 --> 01:12:26,085
Speaker 5:  you're talking about, it's called Starfield. It's got thousands of planets

1213
01:12:26,265 --> 01:12:27,605
Speaker 5:  and you want to go in none of them.

1214
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:31,925
Speaker 6:  Well, no, no, no. See what you forgot though is that game was called load

1215
01:12:31,925 --> 01:12:35,005
Speaker 6:  screen. Yeah. I'm talking about a game where you actually get to do the thing

1216
01:12:35,005 --> 01:12:38,805
Speaker 6:  that you're promised. Man, Starfield really walked into the room at the wrong

1217
01:12:38,805 --> 01:12:42,765
Speaker 6:  time. I'm sorry, Starfield not that bad of a game. I'm very interested

1218
01:12:43,305 --> 01:12:46,885
Speaker 6:  in, man, maybe this is a series that we do next. That distant

1219
01:12:46,905 --> 01:12:50,805
Speaker 6:  future of video games is where I'm really curious about what things

1220
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:53,845
Speaker 6:  are going to get because on top of all these other inflection points, we

1221
01:12:53,845 --> 01:12:57,245
Speaker 6:  are hitting a technological moment that I think is going to

1222
01:12:57,505 --> 01:13:00,205
Speaker 6:  really change what video games look like and feel like.

1223
01:13:00,685 --> 01:13:03,645
Speaker 4:  I think that's right. I've heard a surprising amount of people saying generative

1224
01:13:03,745 --> 01:13:07,245
Speaker 4:  AI is going to completely change everything about how we make and experience

1225
01:13:07,245 --> 01:13:10,125
Speaker 4:  video games. And everybody says that about generative AI and everything.

1226
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:13,325
Speaker 4:  So I'm like, I I kind of do a lot of like patting people on the head when

1227
01:13:13,325 --> 01:13:16,405
Speaker 4:  they say that stuff. But I think fast forward a while and, and you're, you're

1228
01:13:16,485 --> 01:13:16,845
Speaker 4:  probably not wrong.

1229
01:13:17,045 --> 01:13:19,605
Speaker 6:  I was just gonna say with generative ai, I understand that people hear that

1230
01:13:19,605 --> 01:13:23,005
Speaker 6:  and they might think like, oh, generative AI is like creating a game that

1231
01:13:23,005 --> 01:13:26,365
Speaker 6:  I hit the make me a good game button. I'm not talking about that. Like

1232
01:13:26,785 --> 01:13:30,765
Speaker 6:  if you go to any of these major studios, they are farming out

1233
01:13:31,225 --> 01:13:34,485
Speaker 6:  so much work to people who just make

1234
01:13:34,985 --> 01:13:38,845
Speaker 6:  apples and fake Blu-rays and tables that they put in their game.

1235
01:13:38,845 --> 01:13:41,565
Speaker 6:  Just, just stuff assets.

1236
01:13:42,595 --> 01:13:46,365
Speaker 6:  That is a thing that I, I think will be filling that, right? Like

1237
01:13:46,365 --> 01:13:50,325
Speaker 6:  there are, and again, whether or not that's good or evil or

1238
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:54,245
Speaker 6:  or whatever is a whole different thing, but it is going to allow

1239
01:13:54,465 --> 01:13:58,045
Speaker 6:  for scale at a, in a way that I think is gonna be kind of

1240
01:13:58,045 --> 01:13:59,005
Speaker 6:  disorienting at first

1241
01:13:59,745 --> 01:14:03,605
Speaker 4:  All, right? Well in 2038, the three of us are gonna do like a hologram

1242
01:14:04,035 --> 01:14:07,805
Speaker 4:  revisit of this series and we're gonna see what we got right and what we

1243
01:14:07,805 --> 01:14:10,725
Speaker 4:  got wrong. But for now, we gotta go thank you both for doing this. This series

1244
01:14:10,725 --> 01:14:13,240
Speaker 4:  has been been so much fun. We're gonna have to like invent a reason to do

1245
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,125
Speaker 4:  this again. I have very much enjoyed doing this with you guys.

1246
01:14:15,545 --> 01:14:16,845
Speaker 6:  Hey, can we plug our show

1247
01:14:17,105 --> 01:14:17,525
Speaker 4:  Please?

1248
01:14:18,065 --> 01:14:21,525
