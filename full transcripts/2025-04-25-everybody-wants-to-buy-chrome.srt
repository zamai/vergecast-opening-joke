Description: Some weeks, it just feels like everything is up in the air all at the same time. Nilay and David are joined by The Verge’s Jake Kastrenakes to talk about all the unrest, starting with the ever-changing tariff rules that are making gadgets hard to price, hard to find, and hard to bet on going forward. (Maybe that’s why it seems everyone on Earth tried to pre-order a Switch 2 this week.) After that, the hosts catch up on the Meta and Google antitrust trials happening this week, and try to figure out who might be interested in the internet’s most popular browser. Finally, in the lightning round, we talk Brendan Carr (who is a dummy), the wood-backed Motorola Razr Ultra, and the 20th anniversary of YouTube.


2
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:31,035
Speaker 5:  Hello and welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast, winning the Levy

3
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:33,035
Speaker 5:  Awards. David, tell 'em, tell 'em what we've won. We are the

4
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:36,355
Speaker 6:  Flagship podcast of the Webby Awards. I think that's what they told us. Yeah.

5
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:40,395
Speaker 6:  Thank you to everybody who voted. We won two Webby Awards, which are the

6
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:44,195
Speaker 6:  same award, but different awards for best

7
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:47,075
Speaker 6:  technology podcast. Basically there's like the Judges' award and there's

8
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:50,595
Speaker 6:  the People's Choice Award. We care a lot more about the People's Choice Award,

9
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,955
Speaker 6:  but it's like, you know what, if, if there's an award, you might as well

10
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:56,435
Speaker 6:  win it. You know what I mean? Yeah. And we did, we won them both. It was

11
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:59,675
Speaker 6:  very exciting. We're gonna get another one of those cool springy

12
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:04,115
Speaker 6:  statues. I'm very excited about that. Thank you to everybody who voted. I

13
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:07,555
Speaker 6:  know everybody like tolerated us begging for votes for several weeks. So

14
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:10,435
Speaker 6:  I I, I appreciate everybody who voted and we're very excited that we won

15
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:10,795
Speaker 6:  and

16
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:14,555
Speaker 5:  Shouts to everyone else in the category. We appreciate our fellow nominees.

17
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:16,275
Speaker 5:  We defeated you.

18
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:20,195
Speaker 6:  I will say there are some like, sincerely very good podcasts in that group.

19
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:24,475
Speaker 6:  The EFF has had a podcast that was, I think came in second to us. It's very

20
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:28,395
Speaker 6:  good, but was resoundingly defeated by The Verge cast as were

21
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:29,675
Speaker 6:  all of our, we're

22
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:31,955
Speaker 5:  Trying so hard be gracious winners and we're

23
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:32,035
Speaker 1:  Not.

24
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:36,675
Speaker 6:  And I will say the number one piece of feedback that we got was that the

25
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:40,675
Speaker 6:  Webbys needs a new award for best podcast within a podcast, and we are going

26
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:43,035
Speaker 6:  to win it next year. But we'll get to that later.

27
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:46,795
Speaker 5:  That's how, you know, I, we had the, the president of the Grammys on decoder,

28
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:49,475
Speaker 5:  like just before Grammy nominees were announced. And I was like, do you just

29
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:52,035
Speaker 5:  keep inventing categories so Beyonce can win them? And he was like,

30
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:55,115
Speaker 6:  Yes,

31
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:58,675
Speaker 5:  I'm open to it. I'm just, I'm putting, you gotta put the energy in the world

32
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:01,605
Speaker 5:  to collect it in return. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Anyway, I'm a friend

33
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:03,645
Speaker 5:  Eli. That's David Pierce. J Kakis is here.

34
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:04,525
Speaker 6:  Hey, good to be here.

35
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:09,125
Speaker 5:  A lot going on this week. We, we, we should try to unpack what happened

36
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,765
Speaker 5:  with Nintendo Switch to pre-orders. Gadgets are appearing and

37
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:16,565
Speaker 5:  disappearing and prices are vanishing. We're not being announced

38
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:20,045
Speaker 5:  'cause of tariffs. We have to make a list of who might be able to buy Chrome

39
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:22,925
Speaker 5:  because Google is on trial. So is meta

40
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:27,805
Speaker 5:  just a lot going on in our nation's courthouse? Literally the same courthouse,

41
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:29,765
Speaker 5:  both trials in the same courthouse.

42
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like down the hall from each other, essentially. Yeah. It's very funny.

43
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:33,085
Speaker 6:  Our,

44
00:03:33,105 --> 00:03:37,045
Speaker 5:  Our boy Brendan continues to speak or not speak that's

45
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:39,365
Speaker 5:  coming up and then there's a a, a found made of what

46
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:44,845
Speaker 5:  That's true. Just a lot, just a lot in this episode of, but I wanna start

47
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:49,865
Speaker 5:  with listener feedback and, and what I would

48
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:53,755
Speaker 5:  consider an investigation, like a crowdsourced listener

49
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:57,855
Speaker 5:  investigation. So there's evidence, as you all know, that

50
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:01,855
Speaker 5:  the party speaker market is hot. And the only evidence that

51
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:05,845
Speaker 5:  we have of this is that these companies keep making

52
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:06,085
Speaker 5:  them

53
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:11,005
Speaker 5:  like we're five generations into party speakers. They keep getting bigger.

54
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:14,245
Speaker 5:  People add more lights to them, more models are put out

55
00:04:15,195 --> 00:04:19,085
Speaker 5:  buttons to make them make more and less base or added and removed at

56
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:22,805
Speaker 5:  random times. There's something happening here to justify all this

57
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:26,125
Speaker 5:  investment. And we are the locus

58
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:30,785
Speaker 5:  of, I think, the single most important body of analytics

59
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:34,705
Speaker 5:  information about the part party speaker market in the tech industry today.

60
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:38,405
Speaker 5:  Because everyone keeps sending us pictures of party speakers when

61
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:38,685
Speaker 6:  I see them.

62
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:42,765
Speaker 7:  This investigation is going to win us the next webby.

63
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:43,525
Speaker 6:  A hundred

64
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:47,085
Speaker 5:  Percent. It is remarkable that no one has one, but everyone sees them everywhere

65
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:51,045
Speaker 5:  and then sends us photos of them. So we, we've got two this week one

66
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:55,255
Speaker 5:  we are gonna ask for more information about, if you know about this, I think

67
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:58,855
Speaker 5:  this is directly related to our nation's war fighting capability, but

68
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:02,535
Speaker 5:  Sam emails to say, I know a huge target

69
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:06,975
Speaker 5:  for the party speaker market. It is the US military and the

70
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:10,615
Speaker 5:  US militaries in all capital letters. I'm in the Navy and the ship has at

71
00:05:10,615 --> 00:05:14,455
Speaker 5:  least a dozen party speakers that they loan out on deployments

72
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:17,735
Speaker 5:  and such one dozen speakers per ship rules.

73
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:21,695
Speaker 6:  This is rules, this is perfect. You have a bunch of, you know,

74
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:24,695
Speaker 6:  strapping gentlemen who can, who can carry enormous

75
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:28,735
Speaker 6:  speakers. So that helps. And,

76
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:29,735
Speaker 6:  and you

77
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:33,375
Speaker 5:  Know, that's not, there's not like SEAL team six with party speaker.

78
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:37,775
Speaker 6:  There's just one person in every platoon who just carries the party speaker.

79
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:41,935
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And they're out in the world. They're doing

80
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:44,375
Speaker 6:  stuff, they're busy, they can't be tied down by short

81
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,815
Speaker 5:  America's greatest sex sport is our culture and our nation's military is

82
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:51,695
Speaker 5:  just playing bangers on beaches around the world. If you're in the

83
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:55,415
Speaker 5:  military. Sam, tell us more. Sam offered to tell us more. So I'm asking,

84
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:59,885
Speaker 5:  tell, tell us more. Are there fights? Is there a line to get the one dozen

85
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:03,085
Speaker 5:  speakers? Are there one dozen speakers per boat?

86
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:07,705
Speaker 5:  Ooh, are there more on aircraft carriers? Fewer on, I don't know, other

87
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:08,145
Speaker 5:  kinds of boats.

88
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,745
Speaker 6:  This suggests that there, somewhere in the Pentagon there is a budget line

89
00:06:11,745 --> 00:06:12,585
Speaker 6:  for party speakers

90
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:14,105
Speaker 5:  And it hasn't been cut by Doge.

91
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:15,225
Speaker 6:  Right.

92
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:20,185
Speaker 5:  See what I'm saying? Like Elon looked at it and was like

93
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:21,385
Speaker 5:  up number go up

94
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:22,185
Speaker 6:  Just sounds right. Yeah.

95
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:26,005
Speaker 5:  Two dozen per boat. Okay, so that's one you're dying to know more.

96
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:29,725
Speaker 5:  If you can send me a picture of a party speaker on an aircraft carrier with

97
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:33,085
Speaker 5:  a jet going off in the background, I think we might be done here. That might

98
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:34,365
Speaker 5:  be the end of our

99
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:34,565
Speaker 6:  Goals.

100
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:38,085
Speaker 5:  That's fix three. Okay. So that's one second. Matthew

101
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:42,365
Speaker 5:  sent a photo of a giant Sony party speaker in the wild

102
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:46,745
Speaker 5:  in the rain at a soccer clinic. And he says, I've

103
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:50,705
Speaker 5:  included my five-year-old daughter for size comparison. He grinds his permission

104
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:53,625
Speaker 5:  on the photo, we're gonna put smiley face over the face face.

105
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:58,585
Speaker 5:  He, he goes on to say this thing sounded like shit intermittent Bluetooth

106
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,745
Speaker 5:  connection maybe, but I enjoyed its very existence.

107
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:03,515
Speaker 6:  It's fabulous. It

108
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:06,995
Speaker 5:  Is true that the speaker is almost as big as the 5-year-old. Five year olds.

109
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:08,235
Speaker 5:  Very cute as well, by the way. And

110
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:12,155
Speaker 6:  To my previous point, it looks photoshopped like, we'll we'll show this on

111
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:16,075
Speaker 6:  YouTube if, if you're watching this, but I still

112
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:19,915
Speaker 6:  have not seen a picture in which the party speaker does not look like it

113
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:23,435
Speaker 6:  was photoshopped in after the fact. And It is like a preposterously large

114
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,395
Speaker 6:  alien from outer space that has just been inserted into this photo.

115
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:30,755
Speaker 5:  Send me photos, send me photos of frat house basements of car dealerships,

116
00:07:30,855 --> 00:07:34,315
Speaker 5:  soccer tournaments. Again, aircraft carriers. Extremely welcome.

117
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:38,485
Speaker 5:  We're just gonna keep talking about this. The mainstream media won't talk

118
00:07:38,485 --> 00:07:42,285
Speaker 5:  about this, they're all about ai. But I'm saying look at the amount of

119
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:46,165
Speaker 5:  investment and effort that has gone into giant party speakers over the

120
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:46,845
Speaker 5:  past five years.

121
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:51,325
Speaker 6:  And this isn't VC funding, this is just pure capitalism. Yeah. This is like

122
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,725
Speaker 6:  the Sony party speaker is at the end of the hype cycle. Yeah. Which means

123
00:07:54,905 --> 00:07:57,605
Speaker 6:  It is only sustainable based on pure

124
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:59,405
Speaker 6:  unadulterated success.

125
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:03,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. This is the, the, the robots aren't trying to bang Kevin Rus on the

126
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:05,925
Speaker 5:  front page of the New York Times. This is us saying on the ground, the real

127
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:09,565
Speaker 5:  people are demanding speakers the size of their children and the market is

128
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:10,245
Speaker 5:  providing it to them.

129
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:13,635
Speaker 5:  Look at it. Don't look away.

130
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:19,975
Speaker 5:  Alright. Seriously, if you see one said it's delightful every time It is,

131
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:23,815
Speaker 5:  it's very good. Some of you send photos of things that are not party speakers,

132
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:27,775
Speaker 5:  they're just speakers, which I also appreciate that people see speakers in

133
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:31,455
Speaker 5:  the world and they think of me. I lo I love you.

134
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:35,455
Speaker 5:  Thank you. But we, you know, you know what we want Exercise

135
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:35,855
Speaker 5:  and judgment.

136
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:43,005
Speaker 5:  Alright, let's talk about the switch two. It David, you were

137
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:45,605
Speaker 5:  saying just before we, we started recording, everyone knew this would happen

138
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:48,635
Speaker 5:  and it happened, but it also felt like chaos.

139
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:52,835
Speaker 6:  Yeah. This feels like it, it's sort of inevitable, right? I think

140
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:56,845
Speaker 6:  it, it's been clear for a long time that the switch to is, is a

141
00:08:57,015 --> 00:09:00,765
Speaker 6:  giant hit that a lot of people are gonna want very badly. Right. And then

142
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:04,805
Speaker 6:  they were supposed to go on pre-order two weeks ago and then that got delayed

143
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:08,765
Speaker 6:  for a bunch of Taree reasons, but they finally went on

144
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:12,685
Speaker 6:  sale or on pre-order what, Wednesday night into Thursday.

145
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:16,965
Speaker 6:  And it was midnight East coast. Like an alarming

146
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:20,925
Speaker 6:  amount of our staff is, is just useless today because they

147
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:24,325
Speaker 6:  were up late last night trying to order a Switch to,

148
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:28,445
Speaker 6:  and it was on sale at a bunch of places. We had folks checking at Target,

149
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:31,965
Speaker 6:  we had folks checking at Best Buy at Walmart. It was GameStop

150
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:36,405
Speaker 6:  I think like did it, but was coming later. And it was, it was at first

151
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:40,805
Speaker 6:  just a huge gigantic mess right There were like, there were, we

152
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:44,525
Speaker 6:  had people on our team who were like in a line to get in the line, you know,

153
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,485
Speaker 6:  the thing they do with like concert tickets now where they're like, here's

154
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,405
Speaker 6:  the, here's the queue before we put you in the queue to buy tickets. Oh yeah.

155
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:52,645
Speaker 6:  And they did that, but then they, it would just punt you back to the beginning

156
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:56,445
Speaker 6:  of the line when you got to the end of, it's like total mess. But then

157
00:09:57,475 --> 00:10:00,655
Speaker 6:  it seemed like somewhere between like 45 and 60 minutes

158
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:05,255
Speaker 6:  in, so like right around 1:00 AM Eastern, all the systems just

159
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:09,175
Speaker 6:  sort of turned on. And at least on our team, I think everybody who

160
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:13,015
Speaker 6:  wanted one got one. And so it just, it it was a mess

161
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:14,215
Speaker 6:  and then it worked.

162
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,505
Speaker 5:  Sure. I mean that's, that's better than what, what usually happens, which

163
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:22,265
Speaker 5:  is it's a mess and then a spate of apologies are issued

164
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:23,385
Speaker 5:  and then no one gets one.

165
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:27,065
Speaker 6:  Yes. Yeah. Jake, did you try, you didn't try to get one, did you?

166
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:30,865
Speaker 7:  I, I did and I think I am the only person in the United States

167
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:34,665
Speaker 7:  who had a good experience. I I was like, really? I know I normally go to

168
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:36,865
Speaker 7:  bed like around midnight, so I'm like, yeah, whatever. We'll see what happens.

169
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:41,145
Speaker 7:  So a minute rolls around, I open up Target, hit the button all good.

170
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:44,025
Speaker 7:  I signed in the next morning and everything's on fire and everybody's just

171
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:47,465
Speaker 7:  like, like it took it outta my cart. They canceled my order later.

172
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:51,465
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It, it seems like it was a disaster for everybody except for me. And

173
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:55,345
Speaker 7:  so I'm so sorry. I don't even wanna play Mario Kart. I I

174
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:59,185
Speaker 7:  feel like I don't deserve to have had that experience, but

175
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:03,545
Speaker 7:  yeah, I, it seems to me that there is just like maybe fundamentally no

176
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:07,585
Speaker 7:  way to open a webpage and have like

177
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:11,585
Speaker 7:  10 million people hit it at once and just like execute it. Well it like

178
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:15,345
Speaker 7:  this every single time this happens and it never goes well. And I don't know

179
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:16,865
Speaker 7:  that there's a solution for it. There

180
00:11:16,865 --> 00:11:20,745
Speaker 6:  Is some really complicated infrastructural thing going on that I would love

181
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:22,865
Speaker 6:  to know the answer to because like, one of the things that a bunch of folks

182
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:26,785
Speaker 6:  on our team found was, I believe it was Antonio de Benedetto, his wife

183
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:30,425
Speaker 6:  just opened up the target app and bought one just, just like nothing. Totally

184
00:11:30,425 --> 00:11:34,065
Speaker 6:  fine. Yeah. Everybody else is like melting servers across America and she

185
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:37,225
Speaker 6:  just sort of like haphazardly wandered her way into a switch too. Do you

186
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:41,105
Speaker 5:  Think it's, if you look like a bot, the bot honeypots trap you. And so

187
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:44,945
Speaker 5:  like, Jake doesn't look like a bot. 'cause he wasn't like try, he

188
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:48,665
Speaker 5:  didn't have like eight webpages open already. And Antonio's wife

189
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:51,385
Speaker 5:  didn't look like a bot. She just like opened Target and was there and it

190
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:53,690
Speaker 5:  was like, oh, you're not a bot. Like, come on in. Meanwhile,

191
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,510
Speaker 6:  Shy and Hollister shared a screenshot of him with like every store on the

192
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:56,725
Speaker 6:  internet

193
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:59,965
Speaker 5:  Open at the same time. You see what what I'm saying, it's like you look more

194
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:03,685
Speaker 5:  like a bot than not. Like let's see how committed you are. 'cause that's

195
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:07,005
Speaker 5:  the, that's the real root of all the problem, right? Is they all wanna stop

196
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:11,085
Speaker 5:  bot farms and scalpers. And it sounds like, Jake, you're gonna become a

197
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:11,725
Speaker 5:  flipper now.

198
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:15,045
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. I I, how dare you. Like I could take it or leave it, you

199
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:18,325
Speaker 5:  Know, but like that even in ticketing, like this is the problem.

200
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That you, you wanna stop all these bad actors from automating their

201
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,885
Speaker 5:  way into buying all the inventory and reselling it. And so I, it feels like

202
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:26,885
Speaker 5:  that was happening with a switch too.

203
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:32,005
Speaker 5:  But it also feels like now the people are starting to look like bots

204
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,645
Speaker 5:  and getting sent into like bot hell.

205
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:38,445
Speaker 7:  I mean, people are acting like bots, right? Because everybody knows that

206
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:42,405
Speaker 7:  they're up against the bots. And so like everybody has a hundred tabs open

207
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:45,245
Speaker 7:  and there's just like, what is the solution to that? The solution to that

208
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:49,005
Speaker 7:  is like, I, I mean you build competent ticketing,

209
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,845
Speaker 7:  like line weighting infrastructure. You have like a, I don't know, a randomized

210
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:55,285
Speaker 7:  lottery system ahead of time, which

211
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:58,485
Speaker 6:  Didn't work. Nintendo was like, we'll, issue invites. And then right before

212
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:01,365
Speaker 6:  pre-order start Nintendo was like, oh, just kidding. We might invite you

213
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,205
Speaker 6:  like a long time from now.

214
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:07,365
Speaker 7:  Well, and did you see the numbers in Japan? It is incredible.

215
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:10,325
Speaker 7:  So I think this is from Dom's article,

216
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:15,565
Speaker 7:  I believe that in, what was it, eight years ago when the

217
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:17,805
Speaker 7:  original switch came out, it was something like, they sold

218
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:22,325
Speaker 7:  360,000 switch units in Japan within the first month.

219
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:27,525
Speaker 7:  And so, you know, I, who knows how they estimated how

220
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:30,885
Speaker 7:  many they would need in Japan this time around, but they put out this press

221
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:34,765
Speaker 7:  release saying, Hey, we might not have enough for

222
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:38,605
Speaker 7:  the lottery that we announced because 2.2 million

223
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:42,565
Speaker 7:  people have applied Whoa. Which I will say is a lot more switches

224
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:46,925
Speaker 7:  than last time. So Yeah. I I like no wonder they're having a hard time.

225
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:50,685
Speaker 5:  There's also just the additional pent up demand of

226
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,725
Speaker 5:  I better lock in this price now before tariffs arrive.

227
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:57,765
Speaker 7:  Oh, big time. Yeah. Yeah. Because like I, I believe Nintendo like

228
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:00,245
Speaker 7:  a, a week ago or something like that, when they finally said, Hey, we're

229
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:04,165
Speaker 7:  gonna start up pre-orders again that they have like a line in

230
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:07,605
Speaker 7:  their press release. So they're just like, this is the price for now. Yeah.

231
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:11,405
Speaker 7:  And it's like, yeah. Like I, I don't blame them. I I appreciate the like

232
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:15,285
Speaker 7:  limited transparency there just, they have no idea what's gonna happen. Right.

233
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,525
Speaker 6:  And I think it's, there's a chance that not only is the price gonna go up,

234
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:20,445
Speaker 6:  but it might be much harder to get this thing at. Yeah. At some point in

235
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:24,285
Speaker 6:  the relative near future. Like there is the, the sort of shock of the supply

236
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:27,165
Speaker 6:  chain that is coming if and when all this tariff stuff becomes real

237
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,885
Speaker 6:  rightly makes everybody nervous. And we're already starting to see the fallout

238
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:32,485
Speaker 6:  of some of that stuff.

239
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:35,725
Speaker 5:  It's interesting that the things that went up, like major appliance purchases,

240
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:39,685
Speaker 5:  skyrocketed, car purchases have skyrocketed. We have a story about

241
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:43,565
Speaker 5:  that and it, and then there was like Nintendo Switch to panic buying

242
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:47,605
Speaker 5:  occurred, like all, all at the same time. David, it appears you

243
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:49,565
Speaker 5:  bought a Mac and for some reason

244
00:14:50,045 --> 00:14:53,885
Speaker 6:  I did. I I went and panic bot is a little

245
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:56,805
Speaker 6:  strong, but like it's a thing I was gonna need to do in a year and instead

246
00:14:56,845 --> 00:15:00,405
Speaker 6:  I just did it today I bought a new MacBook Air that already I have not even

247
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:03,805
Speaker 6:  turned it on and it has fingerprints all over it. Perfect. So that's good

248
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:07,725
Speaker 6:  stuff. But yeah, there is, there is a real, there is a

249
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:11,605
Speaker 6:  real sort of lingering sense of like, many things have not

250
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:15,605
Speaker 6:  changed yet, but the confusion just

251
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:19,725
Speaker 6:  continues to get so much more confusing that like, folks I talk to all the

252
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:22,805
Speaker 6:  time are like, look, the only responsible thing we can tell you to do is

253
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:26,685
Speaker 6:  if you want something just go get it. Yeah. Like, it, It is, it might be

254
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:26,925
Speaker 6:  fine.

255
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:29,845
Speaker 5:  That's not advice I need to hear. I I wanna

256
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,725
Speaker 6:  Be clear about this, but it like, it, it, there is like a better than 50%

257
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:37,645
Speaker 6:  chance that it will be fine, but it's not like a lot better than 50. Do

258
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,565
Speaker 6:  you know what I mean? And so it's like, okay, if you're at a point where

259
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:43,485
Speaker 6:  you need something where it's sort of a coin flip of like, is It,

260
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,885
Speaker 6:  is it just gonna be sitting on the shelf at this price for you in six months?

261
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:46,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

262
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:50,985
Speaker 5:  I bought a Mac studio as I've been threatening to do for did weeks on this

263
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:54,225
Speaker 5:  show. Yeah. I bought a base model Mac studio and I upgraded the storage in

264
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:57,425
Speaker 5:  it, which made it a custom order. And I watched that thing

265
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:01,825
Speaker 5:  sit at the, at the dock in China. Oh wow. Going through customs

266
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:05,865
Speaker 5:  waiting to see Oof. I watched the DHL shipping page.

267
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:09,345
Speaker 5:  It, it's here. It's, it's, it's a delight. It's so much more computer than

268
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:12,945
Speaker 5:  I need. Like every time I push it and the fan comes on, I'm like, I don't

269
00:16:12,945 --> 00:16:13,265
Speaker 5:  deserve this.

270
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,345
Speaker 7:  How many local AI models do you run?

271
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:18,305
Speaker 5:  Yeah, just all, it's just talking to me all day long just to

272
00:16:18,465 --> 00:16:21,345
Speaker 7:  Distract. I I'm actually neli vibe coded me. I'm, I'm not here.

273
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:26,745
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's, it's vastly more computer than a, and the old iMac is sitting

274
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:30,105
Speaker 5:  here and I am gonna in fact peel out the guts and try to make it a display.

275
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:33,465
Speaker 5:  It's, I'm gonna break It is what I'm gonna do, but it's, it's, but I didn't

276
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:36,505
Speaker 5:  need to buy it like you David. I was like, at some point I'm gonna do this

277
00:16:37,215 --> 00:16:40,525
Speaker 5:  and then all this happened and I don't know, I just, I didn't, I didn't need

278
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:44,365
Speaker 5:  a lot of push. It sounds like you didn't need a lot of push either.

279
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:48,885
Speaker 6:  No, I needed exactly zero push. I needed a reason to be out

280
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:52,445
Speaker 6:  of my house this morning is what I needed. My, it worked out great,

281
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:56,525
Speaker 6:  but there, but It is a real thing. It's like I, I have a laptop that is kind

282
00:16:56,525 --> 00:17:00,345
Speaker 6:  of on its last legs and would like to know that

283
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:03,065
Speaker 6:  the laptop I need is the right thing. I mean, it's like, I used to make fun

284
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,305
Speaker 6:  of Walt Mossberg years ago because he bought I think

285
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:10,505
Speaker 6:  like at least two, but maybe even several of the last

286
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:14,665
Speaker 6:  MacBook Air before they put in the butterfly keyboard. Yep. And his

287
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:16,985
Speaker 6:  excuse is always like, I might need another laptop and I don't wanna have

288
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:20,785
Speaker 6:  a crappy one. And I sort of feel that way now too. Like, yeah, I don't need

289
00:17:20,785 --> 00:17:24,745
Speaker 6:  this thing today, but I will need it eventually and I would like it to

290
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:24,985
Speaker 6:  be here.

291
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,225
Speaker 7:  Well the other thing is like, you know, the reason you wait is you think,

292
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:32,025
Speaker 7:  okay, I'm gonna, like, the price is gonna go down and, and, and at the very

293
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:35,825
Speaker 7:  least we know that is not going to happen. So if, if, if you're okay with

294
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:38,625
Speaker 7:  suffering whatever the standard price is and you're just going to buy it

295
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:42,265
Speaker 7:  like six months from now or a year from now, it's like Hmm. The, the gamble

296
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:43,545
Speaker 7:  becomes a lot more appealing.

297
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:47,225
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And we're, again, we're seeing this all over the place and then we're

298
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:50,645
Speaker 5:  also seeing just some companies opting out,

299
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:54,965
Speaker 5:  right? Amber Brunick, which makes a bunch of Game Boy clones, which are ably

300
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:58,525
Speaker 5:  legal anyway. They're like, we can't do this anymore. Like they, they just

301
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:02,205
Speaker 5:  halted all shipments. There's another one called A A YN,

302
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:05,725
Speaker 5:  they're pausing their shipments of basically Game Boy clones.

303
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:10,205
Speaker 5:  Those companies were always under threat. Like we, we've been talking and

304
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:14,045
Speaker 5:  writing about those companies, like they're in a very gray area legally where

305
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:17,285
Speaker 5:  it feels like the addition of tariffs to their existing risk.

306
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:21,445
Speaker 5:  It is like, just makes that not a good business to be in. And so like why

307
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:24,565
Speaker 5:  wouldn't they just stop and so like get some certainty. We have a big story

308
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:28,165
Speaker 5:  about just general confusion in the auto industry

309
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:32,095
Speaker 5:  about what parts of cars are gonna get,

310
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:35,735
Speaker 5:  what tariffs from China. The Trump administration is pausing and un pausing

311
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:38,375
Speaker 5:  tariffs. They've announced that they're in talks and then the Chinese government

312
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,055
Speaker 5:  said they're not in talks. You can watch the stock market just go up and

313
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:45,015
Speaker 5:  down just begging. Like literally the stock market is

314
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:48,615
Speaker 5:  just begging for someone to tell them some, some good news. I keep joking

315
00:18:48,615 --> 00:18:51,695
Speaker 5:  that all of CNBC right now is just a long podcast about a shitty chart.

316
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:56,215
Speaker 5:  And like, I like literal and It is great. It's the most compelling television

317
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:59,335
Speaker 5:  you can watch because every day someone's like, do you know what's going

318
00:18:59,335 --> 00:19:01,215
Speaker 5:  on this chart? And or else Sarkin is like, I don't know. And like that's

319
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:04,895
Speaker 5:  the whole, it's eight hours of CNBC. Elizabeth Warren

320
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:09,015
Speaker 5:  is basically asking Apple if they finagled a tariff exception

321
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:13,355
Speaker 5:  because that is corruption like pretty straightforwardly

322
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:17,355
Speaker 5:  I would say. We have some reporting, it's not totally locked down that a

323
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:20,475
Speaker 5:  lot of tech companies are asking for tariff exceptions. And this isn't just

324
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:24,315
Speaker 5:  Tim Cook being special, we're trying to nail it down. But

325
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,875
Speaker 5:  that's just happening, right? Like different companies are getting different

326
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,315
Speaker 5:  messages about what will get tariffed and what won't get tariffed. The major

327
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:36,115
Speaker 5:  retailers, like, I think it's Walmart and Target and Best Buy all went

328
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:40,155
Speaker 5:  to the White House and said our our shells will be empty and the the tariffs

329
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:43,915
Speaker 5:  have pulled back. There's just a lot going on here that seems to

330
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:47,715
Speaker 5:  indicate like you're saying David, that come a few months from now, there

331
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:51,325
Speaker 5:  might not be stuff Yeah. Because no one is shipping things to the United States

332
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:51,685
Speaker 5:  right now.

333
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:56,005
Speaker 6:  Right. I think it was it, it was DHL right? That just stopped taking deliveries

334
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:59,565
Speaker 6:  to the US over $800 because it, again, everybody's just at this point where

335
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:03,245
Speaker 6:  it's like this, we don't know what's happening. We don't

336
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:07,045
Speaker 6:  know the rules, we don't know what it's gonna be like tomorrow. And so

337
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:10,925
Speaker 6:  the, the risk of literally putting something on a boat from

338
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:14,565
Speaker 6:  China is too high because we don't know what the situation's going to be

339
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:18,405
Speaker 6:  like when it gets there. Like It is. It's that simple and

340
00:20:18,405 --> 00:20:21,965
Speaker 6:  crazy. And I will say it's worth pointing out over and over again that this

341
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:25,725
Speaker 6:  is precisely the point, right? Like this is the thing that President

342
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,685
Speaker 6:  Trump keeps saying is that this is all about leverage. He wants them to come

343
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:33,485
Speaker 6:  to him and try to make a deal the, the, the flying to Mar-a-Lago to

344
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:37,525
Speaker 6:  beg him to make a tariff exemption so that he feels powerful and special.

345
00:20:38,065 --> 00:20:41,885
Speaker 6:  That's the whole point. And the, the confusion and the chaos is

346
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:45,725
Speaker 6:  the thing that they are doing here on purpose. But what we're seeing

347
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,445
Speaker 6:  is it has just absolutely frozen everybody.

348
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:53,285
Speaker 6:  Like I, I got a Bowers and Wilkins launched new headphones

349
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:57,445
Speaker 6:  today and I got an email from a comms person just like, you know,

350
00:20:57,445 --> 00:20:59,405
Speaker 6:  sending along the press release and a picture being like, Hey, we launched

351
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:02,485
Speaker 6:  a new thing. And it just says, due to the uncertainty at the tariff situation,

352
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:06,245
Speaker 6:  pricing and availability are not available at this time. However, a notify

353
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:08,805
Speaker 6:  me button will be placed on the Bowers and Wilkins website for customers

354
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:12,005
Speaker 6:  who wish to purchase the product. So literally the best you can do for a

355
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,565
Speaker 6:  pair of headphones you want that a lot of people are gonna like and are gonna

356
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:18,365
Speaker 6:  be very good is click a button that says, tell me when you know how much

357
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:22,045
Speaker 6:  this thing is gonna cost. Like that's, that's where we are and we're starting

358
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:25,325
Speaker 6:  to see that a lot of places that like over and over

359
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:29,765
Speaker 6:  we're just going to get things that that companies have made but

360
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:33,685
Speaker 6:  literally don't know if or how to sell them to you. Yeah. And

361
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:34,405
Speaker 6:  that's wild.

362
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:38,045
Speaker 7:  I think we're gonna see a lot of companies waiting till the absolute last

363
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:40,245
Speaker 7:  second to declare what their pricing is.

364
00:21:42,105 --> 00:21:45,945
Speaker 7:  'cause again, like you, you don't even know if the

365
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:47,705
Speaker 7:  day you announced your pricing things are gonna change.

366
00:21:48,035 --> 00:21:51,665
Speaker 6:  Right. That was the Nintendo thing, right? They they launched it in what,

367
00:21:51,755 --> 00:21:52,625
Speaker 6:  April? They

368
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,865
Speaker 7:  Launched it the day the tariffs were announced.

369
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:59,025
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And for a product that's coming out in two months and, and like I I

370
00:21:59,205 --> 00:22:00,345
Speaker 6:  bet they regret that decision.

371
00:22:00,565 --> 00:22:01,905
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. Yeah.

372
00:22:02,085 --> 00:22:05,735
Speaker 5:  So Ryan Peterson is the CEO of Flexport, which is a soft well

373
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:09,655
Speaker 5:  shipping software company that a lot of people use them to manage how things

374
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:13,335
Speaker 5:  get across the world. He was just on decoder. His Twitter feed is totally

375
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:14,295
Speaker 5:  spicy. He's

376
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:17,095
Speaker 6:  Become everybody's like WTF tariff guy because he's

377
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:19,975
Speaker 5:  Very, he's very spicy. He's very good. It's a, it's a fun episode. He is

378
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:23,015
Speaker 5:  a fun Listen, he is everywhere all the time now. 'cause he has all this data.

379
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:27,175
Speaker 5:  So he tweeted yesterday in the three weeks

380
00:22:27,175 --> 00:22:30,855
Speaker 5:  since the tariff took effect, ocean container bookings from China, the

381
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:34,415
Speaker 5:  United States are down over 60% industrywide. Wow. And then just today he

382
00:22:34,415 --> 00:22:38,375
Speaker 5:  tweeted the number of container ships sitting idle at the ports of Shanghai

383
00:22:38,455 --> 00:22:42,415
Speaker 5:  and NBO and China are double what they were a month ago. And then

384
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:47,255
Speaker 5:  I think that is starting to spook people because there's reporting

385
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:51,055
Speaker 5:  and no one really knows what's eman jers from CNBC. It is pretty reliable.

386
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,935
Speaker 5:  Says treasury secretary Scott Cent said the next step was

387
00:22:55,985 --> 00:22:59,495
Speaker 5:  China are, no one thinks the current status quo is sustainable. 145 and

388
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:03,215
Speaker 5:  125%. There will be a deescalation and

389
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,935
Speaker 5:  that should give you a sigh of relief. If you look at the number of

390
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:10,695
Speaker 5:  container bookings between the United States and China, it's down 64%.

391
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:14,415
Speaker 5:  The goal is not to decouple the United States from China. It's to deescalate.

392
00:23:14,515 --> 00:23:18,135
Speaker 5:  So it's like, oh, they're just caving like nothing happened. Yeah. And they're

393
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:21,535
Speaker 5:  just like walking it back. But that means no one knows how much anything

394
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:24,615
Speaker 5:  will cost. And we're just seeing it across the whole industry.

395
00:23:25,095 --> 00:23:28,975
Speaker 5:  Products are being announced without pricing. People are rushing to buy things

396
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:31,975
Speaker 5:  before tariffs hit. And all these companies are showing up at the White House

397
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:35,975
Speaker 5:  basically asking for exemptions. Right. And we don't know how those will

398
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:39,705
Speaker 5:  be applied or not. It does seem like I should buy a car. Is that the next

399
00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:41,905
Speaker 5:  thing I should do? I do like reasons to buy.

400
00:23:43,585 --> 00:23:44,185
Speaker 5:  I dunno what car

401
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:47,765
Speaker 6:  We're gonna buy. We're just at a point now where it's, it's hard to know

402
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:50,845
Speaker 6:  anything. Right. And I think like the, the funny thing about this Tim Cook

403
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:54,245
Speaker 6:  news is that there is this overwhelming sense in the industry that Tim Cook

404
00:23:54,245 --> 00:23:58,205
Speaker 6:  is the only one. He's like the fixer who for

405
00:23:58,265 --> 00:24:02,085
Speaker 6:  say what you want about apple's, you know, creativity and it's product

406
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:05,965
Speaker 6:  development. Like my guy knows how to get things shipped. Like

407
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:09,885
Speaker 6:  that's, that's a thing Tim Cook is, is like historically great at,

408
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:14,125
Speaker 6:  and it, it's just very funny that all of this stuff is happening and

409
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:17,405
Speaker 6:  everybody's like, well, okay, there's a, there was an exemption for like

410
00:24:17,895 --> 00:24:21,605
Speaker 6:  chips and smartphones and computers like Hmm, who makes all of those?

411
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:26,645
Speaker 6:  And you could just sort of see like there's, there's a real, like, you know,

412
00:24:26,785 --> 00:24:30,165
Speaker 6:  the silhouette of Tim Cook like walking out of the West Wing in a suit and

413
00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:32,165
Speaker 6:  he just like accomplished all of his goals.

414
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,635
Speaker 6:  I have no idea if Tim Cook did that, but yeah,

415
00:24:36,695 --> 00:24:38,875
Speaker 5:  No one knows. And there, there, there are a lot of confusion and the, and

416
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:42,835
Speaker 5:  the first term, the way he accomplished that was by convincing Trump

417
00:24:42,985 --> 00:24:46,235
Speaker 5:  that if you put these tariffs on somehow Samsung would beat Apple.

418
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:50,755
Speaker 5:  And that you can't have that. Right. Who, who knows

419
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:53,235
Speaker 5:  what the mechanism there would've been.

420
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:54,675
Speaker 6:  It was Bixby. If

421
00:24:54,815 --> 00:24:58,795
Speaker 5:  It was Bixby, it was Samsung, it was Saturday Samsung. They're

422
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:02,355
Speaker 5:  gonna give you a free TV with every TV you buy and somehow that will defeat

423
00:25:02,355 --> 00:25:05,835
Speaker 5:  Apple. But that was his argument and you Trump said it many times in his

424
00:25:05,835 --> 00:25:09,035
Speaker 5:  first term that I, I eased some of these tariffs back. 'cause they didn't

425
00:25:09,035 --> 00:25:12,435
Speaker 5:  want Apple to get defeated by Samsung. I'm not sure what anyone is saying

426
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:16,275
Speaker 5:  now. The tariffs are across the board, like literally across the

427
00:25:16,275 --> 00:25:19,955
Speaker 5:  board to every country. And we don't know what's gonna happen in these markets.

428
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:23,925
Speaker 5:  So I think we're seeing a lot of, a lot of rush to buy things.

429
00:25:23,945 --> 00:25:27,445
Speaker 5:  We, we've seen all those stories everywhere. And all that means is somewhere

430
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:30,765
Speaker 5:  at the end of this, just like Covid, there will be a giant fall.

431
00:25:31,025 --> 00:25:31,245
Speaker 6:  Yep.

432
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:34,285
Speaker 5:  People will have the stuff, they will not need the stuff and the industry

433
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:37,885
Speaker 5:  will not be even at like, there will not be even demand across the year

434
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:42,125
Speaker 5:  or across years. It will be, oh, we bought everything in April of

435
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:45,885
Speaker 5:  2025 and so a year from now, no one will need anything.

436
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:47,885
Speaker 5:  And that is, that's always Rocky.

437
00:25:48,195 --> 00:25:51,605
Speaker 6:  It's so funny you mentioned that I was thinking about this with Peloton just

438
00:25:51,605 --> 00:25:55,205
Speaker 6:  today. That like, Jake, to your point about the, the gigantic

439
00:25:55,365 --> 00:25:58,485
Speaker 6:  numbers in Japan, like if I am Nintendo,

440
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,685
Speaker 6:  do you look at this and say, okay, awesome, this is going to be a

441
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:06,205
Speaker 6:  monstrous hit on proportions we had not even imagined.

442
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:10,965
Speaker 6:  Let's go make a ton more of these things because, because this is,

443
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:14,165
Speaker 6:  this is going to take over the world and we have won and we have to go chase

444
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:18,085
Speaker 6:  that. Or are we gonna do the thing that Peloton did, which is

445
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:22,405
Speaker 6:  look at a bunch of people who bought a thing all at once for mostly cultural

446
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:25,285
Speaker 6:  reasons. As it turned out, this was like the beginning of the pandemic and

447
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:28,445
Speaker 6:  every person on earth who had ever thought maybe I should buy a Peloton bought

448
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:32,325
Speaker 6:  one all at the same time. They all did. And Peloton took that to mean, oh,

449
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:37,405
Speaker 6:  sick, we're so much cooler than we thought we were. This growth will go on

450
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:41,325
Speaker 6:  forever. And then what happens is you make a bunch of stuff, it's very

451
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:43,620
Speaker 6:  expensive to store all that stuff. You don't sell it that very fast and it

452
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,245
Speaker 6:  destroys your business. Like it's wait,

453
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:49,125
Speaker 5:  Wait. Peloton made an even bigger mistake. They bought Precore. They

454
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:52,525
Speaker 5:  they bought another company for its manufacturing

455
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:53,685
Speaker 5:  capabilities. That's

456
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:54,485
Speaker 6:  Right. I forgot they did that.

457
00:26:54,485 --> 00:26:57,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And then they were like, shit, we own Precore. Right?

458
00:26:57,635 --> 00:26:58,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Which

459
00:26:58,555 --> 00:27:02,525
Speaker 5:  Like, we, we own these factories to make treadmills that no one wants. Right.

460
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:07,405
Speaker 5:  They have a since recover. They're like two CEOs since then. Yeah. Pelotons

461
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:11,205
Speaker 6:  Doing fine. But I, but I do think, and it's, It is, I actually feel for

462
00:27:11,645 --> 00:27:15,325
Speaker 6:  companies in a moment like this, because It is so hard to know, and you have

463
00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:19,245
Speaker 6:  to make so many of these decisions with such long lead times and things are

464
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:22,965
Speaker 6:  changing so quickly that like God help anyone who has to make like,

465
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:27,365
Speaker 6:  you know, multimillion dollar inventory decisions about 20, 27 right now,

466
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:29,925
Speaker 6:  which like people have to do. That's a thing that's happening. Yeah. And

467
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:31,725
Speaker 6:  It is, it, it just all seems impossible.

468
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:35,165
Speaker 7:  I'll say for the Switch, I think it's like maybe a little bit different just

469
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:38,965
Speaker 7:  because of the timeline of that product. Right. Nintendo is selling

470
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,965
Speaker 7:  effectively the exact same product they made eight years ago. Yeah. For

471
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:46,525
Speaker 7:  the exact same price. They like changed the chip once, but it's

472
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:47,565
Speaker 7:  fundamentally the same thing

473
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,525
Speaker 6:  And it's doing fine still for

474
00:27:49,525 --> 00:27:52,925
Speaker 7:  Them. Like, I don't know, like it's, It is gonna be a little bumpy, but like

475
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:56,245
Speaker 7:  they'll be whatever. They can just put out some more switch one games like

476
00:27:56,995 --> 00:27:58,565
Speaker 7:  that, that's where all the money is for them.

477
00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:01,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. No, I, I think you're probably right. Nintendo is probably as immune

478
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,965
Speaker 6:  to this as just about anybody.

479
00:28:03,185 --> 00:28:07,045
Speaker 7:  But I do think in general like this idea of like, oh man, all these

480
00:28:07,325 --> 00:28:09,885
Speaker 7:  companies have no idea how to plan for the future. Oh yeah. It's gonna be

481
00:28:09,885 --> 00:28:13,845
Speaker 7:  really tricky. I I have no idea what this's gonna look like a

482
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:15,285
Speaker 7:  year from now when people are,

483
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:21,065
Speaker 7:  you know, have already bought everything or we just don't have any products.

484
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:25,255
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Do you know what the all time number one we

485
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:28,445
Speaker 5:  thought the pandemic would be forever. Mistake was,

486
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:29,725
Speaker 5:  Ooh,

487
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:33,855
Speaker 7:  I, I'm Can I, I'm guessing I'm gonna guess you're going with

488
00:28:34,525 --> 00:28:35,895
Speaker 7:  Verizon BlueJean.

489
00:28:36,795 --> 00:28:37,535
Speaker 6:  That's a good one.

490
00:28:39,355 --> 00:28:41,855
Speaker 5:  The CEO of Verizon Wireless was on, he was like, yeah, it was a rounding

491
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:43,175
Speaker 5:  error. So no, but the good one.

492
00:28:43,175 --> 00:28:44,935
Speaker 6:  Okay. Okay. Is it fancy webcams?

493
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:45,455
Speaker 5:  Nope.

494
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:46,015
Speaker 6:  Damn.

495
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,215
Speaker 5:  What is it? No, no, no. It's so bad. It's so bad. It's so big. I it's it's

496
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:49,935
Speaker 5:  so big you can't see it.

497
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:53,985
Speaker 5:  Facebook renamed itself meta. No.

498
00:28:54,185 --> 00:28:54,305
Speaker 7:  Oh

499
00:28:54,505 --> 00:28:54,705
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

500
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:59,545
Speaker 5:  That's, they were like, we're gonna live, we're gonna do cartoons. No legs,

501
00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:00,065
Speaker 5:  no

502
00:29:00,065 --> 00:29:00,785
Speaker 6:  One ever outside. We're

503
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:01,745
Speaker 5:  All day

504
00:29:01,745 --> 00:29:04,505
Speaker 7:  Long. You know what though? I think that's worked out for them. Everyone

505
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:08,105
Speaker 7:  has, everyone has forgotten that they're, they're furious with Facebook.

506
00:29:08,825 --> 00:29:12,505
Speaker 7:  They've forgotten why was renamed Meta because no one ever

507
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:16,425
Speaker 7:  used Meta Horizon. Like it, nobody's like,

508
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:20,185
Speaker 7:  man, that thing we sure stopped using that. Yeah. Like Zoom, everybody's

509
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:23,985
Speaker 7:  like, boy that really like went in the bucket afterwards. Horizon,

510
00:29:24,135 --> 00:29:27,185
Speaker 7:  horizon Worlds, whatever is doing just as well as it ever was.

511
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:32,145
Speaker 5:  That's certain. What was the one concert in Fortnite that at just

512
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:34,675
Speaker 5:  ev it confused everyone. Do you know what I'm

513
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:35,915
Speaker 6:  Talking about? Was it was Travis Scott? It

514
00:29:35,915 --> 00:29:38,035
Speaker 5:  Was Travis Scott. That's what it was. Yeah. They did as old and Fortnite.

515
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:41,765
Speaker 5:  Yep. And I mean, just that day, like Mark

516
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:45,125
Speaker 5:  Zuckerberg is like, we are, everyone's gonna be at home Oh yeah. In headsets

517
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:48,875
Speaker 5:  forever. And it's like, no, the kids really

518
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:52,795
Speaker 5:  want to go outside. Like they want Yeah. They want to look at

519
00:29:52,795 --> 00:29:54,515
Speaker 5:  a Travis Hunt concert at the concert.

520
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:58,355
Speaker 6:  So just to give people some, some inside baseball here, when you're a reporter,

521
00:29:58,495 --> 00:30:02,395
Speaker 6:  one of the things that happens is anytime there is like a big moment

522
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:06,475
Speaker 6:  of some sort product launch sort of cultural event, whatever, one

523
00:30:06,475 --> 00:30:10,355
Speaker 6:  of the things that happens to every reporter is a million people flood into

524
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:13,955
Speaker 6:  their inbox offering some kind of quote about that thing.

525
00:30:14,305 --> 00:30:18,235
Speaker 6:  Like, my CEO would love to talk about how this affects B2B ad sales

526
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:22,035
Speaker 6:  or like, whatever. That was one of those days that I, I distinctly

527
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:26,355
Speaker 6:  remember the, the, the Travis Scott concert in Fortnite happens

528
00:30:26,495 --> 00:30:30,195
Speaker 6:  and I had a hundred emails the next day from people who were like, let me

529
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:34,115
Speaker 6:  tell you why this just changed everything about how society is going

530
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:37,755
Speaker 6:  to work. Yeah. And it was like, you're totally right. It was like, this is

531
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:41,555
Speaker 6:  a moment and the world will never be the same afterwards. And it was,

532
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:43,235
Speaker 6:  it went right back.

533
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:47,515
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But that's this, I mean, what's what's staggering about

534
00:30:47,515 --> 00:30:51,275
Speaker 5:  all of that is Covid was an external crisis. Like it happened

535
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:54,555
Speaker 5:  and everyone reacted to it. And then however you experienced covid,

536
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:59,035
Speaker 5:  like a, a number of behaviors changed. A really

537
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:03,075
Speaker 5:  interesting one, for example, is we started decoder before Covid

538
00:31:03,535 --> 00:31:06,395
Speaker 5:  and no one wanted to be on video. And now everyone's assumption is that they

539
00:31:06,395 --> 00:31:09,475
Speaker 5:  will be on Google meet calls. Yep. Weird. That's just a totally a pandemic

540
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:12,715
Speaker 5:  change that happened. Tariffs are a totally self

541
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:17,155
Speaker 5:  created mess. Like, they woke up one day, they asked Cha

542
00:31:17,215 --> 00:31:21,035
Speaker 5:  PD how to ruin the world economy. And like, here we are. But the same

543
00:31:21,035 --> 00:31:24,875
Speaker 5:  kind of like ripple effects are happening. You can just see it and, but

544
00:31:24,895 --> 00:31:28,315
Speaker 5:  no one, there's no behavior change around it. It's

545
00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:32,035
Speaker 5:  like on balance, it's, it's a little bit easier to convince David to buy

546
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:36,325
Speaker 5:  a MacBook Air that that's where we're right now. And that is, but

547
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:40,125
Speaker 5:  that's on a permanent change. It, it's not like a, everyone

548
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:43,325
Speaker 5:  got used to video conferencing over these two years. Right. But you can see

549
00:31:43,325 --> 00:31:46,245
Speaker 5:  that companies are having to deal with it in, in kind of the same ways.

550
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:50,575
Speaker 5:  I don't know, like there's just something I wish I could, if I could go back

551
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:54,575
Speaker 5:  before Covid and predict what would've happened that you maybe

552
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:56,975
Speaker 5:  would've predicted. Everyone gets more comfortable with video calls and working

553
00:31:56,975 --> 00:32:00,815
Speaker 5:  from home, but there's this one, I I'm just not sure what the change

554
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:03,495
Speaker 5:  is other than everyone's kind of mad that they can't get a switch to,

555
00:32:03,945 --> 00:32:07,775
Speaker 6:  Right. Yeah. I mean there's gonna be like a long, long road of

556
00:32:07,915 --> 00:32:10,895
Speaker 6:  here's what happens when everything gets more expensive and harder to find.

557
00:32:11,075 --> 00:32:12,695
Speaker 6:  But in terms of this sort of,

558
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:17,655
Speaker 6:  you know, one day to the next culture change,

559
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:22,215
Speaker 6:  like here's hoping we never go through that again. Right? Like that was,

560
00:32:22,215 --> 00:32:22,815
Speaker 6:  that was such

561
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:28,345
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back. Which trial should we start with? Should we start

562
00:35:28,345 --> 00:35:30,665
Speaker 5:  with Google? Should we start with meta?

563
00:35:31,055 --> 00:35:34,865
Speaker 6:  They're both so good. Let's do Google first just because I'm like, I need

564
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:38,725
Speaker 6:  to warm up to how much fun I found Kevin Strom at the meta trial. Yeah, so

565
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:39,725
Speaker 6:  let's, let's do Google first.

566
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:43,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah, Google's a little simpler there. There's a game to be played here right

567
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:47,085
Speaker 5:  now. Google is in the remedies phase on the search

568
00:35:47,095 --> 00:35:50,965
Speaker 5:  trial. It has lost the ad tech trial. If you want nitty

569
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:55,125
Speaker 5:  gritty on what those trials were, what those cases claimed,

570
00:35:55,305 --> 00:35:59,125
Speaker 5:  how they were constructed. Jonathan Cantor who led the DOJs antitrust division

571
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:02,085
Speaker 5:  was just un decoder. We went through them in detail, so we'll hold off on

572
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:05,445
Speaker 5:  the detail. But the remedies phase of the search trial. Google was found

573
00:36:05,445 --> 00:36:09,285
Speaker 5:  to have an illegal monopoly in Search par, partially because they pay

574
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:12,845
Speaker 5:  a bunch of money to Apple and other companies for defaults in Safari and

575
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:16,345
Speaker 5:  other places. Now we're onto, what are we gonna do about it?

576
00:36:16,965 --> 00:36:20,105
Speaker 5:  The government says, and David, you were there for this part of the trial,

577
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,705
Speaker 5:  so I wanna hear what this was like in person. The government says you gotta

578
00:36:22,705 --> 00:36:26,615
Speaker 5:  sell Chrome and you gotta make search interoperable. And this

579
00:36:26,675 --> 00:36:29,455
Speaker 5:  is happening literally in the same courthouse in which

580
00:36:30,475 --> 00:36:34,045
Speaker 5:  meta is on trial to have to sell

581
00:36:34,045 --> 00:36:36,965
Speaker 5:  Instagram and WhatsApp and Lauren finder's like running between the courtrooms,

582
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:40,845
Speaker 5:  which is hilarious to me. Yeah. Let's talk about the Google piece. You

583
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:43,125
Speaker 5:  were in the courtroom and the government sort of like made this big claim.

584
00:36:43,595 --> 00:36:44,805
Speaker 5:  What, what are the vibes?

585
00:36:45,225 --> 00:36:47,925
Speaker 6:  So I was there for opening arguments on Monday and

586
00:36:49,425 --> 00:36:53,325
Speaker 6:  one of the funniest parts about it to me was how much of opening arguments

587
00:36:53,435 --> 00:36:56,845
Speaker 6:  were just the lawyers reminding the judge of

588
00:36:57,155 --> 00:37:01,125
Speaker 6:  what laws are. It's like, 'cause there's a real sense of like, it,

589
00:37:01,145 --> 00:37:04,325
Speaker 6:  it becomes, I I discovered this in the, in the course of like talking to

590
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:08,245
Speaker 6:  people about this and being there that like reminding everyone

591
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:11,845
Speaker 6:  at the beginning of a remedies phase that Google is a monopolist and it lost

592
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:15,365
Speaker 6:  and it has been convicted and that that is no longer the question that is

593
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:18,925
Speaker 6:  the starting point was, was so important for the government, right? Because

594
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:22,725
Speaker 6:  they're setting up this thing where it's not a question of whether Google

595
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:27,165
Speaker 6:  did the wrong thing. Google is gonna appeal that and we will be litigating

596
00:37:27,165 --> 00:37:31,125
Speaker 6:  that for forever. But for the purposes of right now, Google

597
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:34,925
Speaker 6:  is a convicted monopolist that is, that is no longer in question.

598
00:37:35,705 --> 00:37:38,885
Speaker 6:  And so David Dahlquist, who did the opening arguments for

599
00:37:39,505 --> 00:37:43,365
Speaker 6:  the DOJ said that like over and over and over again, he's like

600
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:46,605
Speaker 6:  every, every two sentence, he was like, well, because Google is a monopolist.

601
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:52,725
Speaker 6:  But it, it was really interesting and I think these two sides have had a

602
00:37:52,725 --> 00:37:56,365
Speaker 6:  long time to talk to each other and do

603
00:37:56,365 --> 00:38:00,325
Speaker 6:  discovery and figure things out and try to like understand what they

604
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:03,365
Speaker 6:  want. And if anything, it feels like they're getting further apart from each

605
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:03,445
Speaker 6:  other.

606
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,405
Speaker 5:  Well you're about as far as you can get right now.

607
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:09,485
Speaker 6:  I mean, yes, but the, the do j's argument, I I would, I would actually put

608
00:38:09,485 --> 00:38:13,285
Speaker 6:  it into three buckets. One is you have to sell Chrome. One

609
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:17,325
Speaker 6:  is no more distribution deals of any kind. You, you cannot, you cannot

610
00:38:17,355 --> 00:38:21,285
Speaker 6:  give Apple $20 billion to make you the default search engine engine in Safari.

611
00:38:21,915 --> 00:38:25,845
Speaker 6:  They would just like to get rid of those deals entirely. And then number

612
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:29,485
Speaker 6:  three is, is what you said about interoperable. They want Google to essentially

613
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:32,725
Speaker 6:  white label Google search for anyone who wants it.

614
00:38:34,485 --> 00:38:38,225
Speaker 6:  Google doesn't like any of those surprise, what Google wants

615
00:38:38,225 --> 00:38:41,385
Speaker 6:  essentially is to stop making

616
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:45,265
Speaker 6:  exclusive deals. It would essentially like to take the word exclusive

617
00:38:45,925 --> 00:38:49,825
Speaker 6:  out of all of its contracts. And so the

618
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:53,745
Speaker 6:  idea is, well now anyone can play the games that we are playing. If you

619
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:56,905
Speaker 6:  wanna give Apple $20 billion, you're welcome to.

620
00:38:58,105 --> 00:39:01,185
Speaker 6:  I would argue that is preposterous. That is also what the government argues.

621
00:39:01,325 --> 00:39:05,145
Speaker 6:  But the thing that I found most interesting is that it seems very

622
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:08,905
Speaker 6:  clear to me that the, the one of those three things that Google is most

623
00:39:08,905 --> 00:39:11,425
Speaker 6:  nervous about is the white labeling of Google.

624
00:39:12,865 --> 00:39:15,305
Speaker 6:  I think the, the Chrome thing is really interesting and I wanna talk about

625
00:39:15,325 --> 00:39:19,225
Speaker 6:  who might buy Chrome, but essentially what is being

626
00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:23,185
Speaker 6:  asked of Google, if the DOJ gets its way is to take all of its data. So

627
00:39:23,185 --> 00:39:26,785
Speaker 6:  it's it's search index, it's query data, which is like what people are actually

628
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:30,025
Speaker 6:  sending even it's like ranking algorithms and systems

629
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:34,545
Speaker 6:  and just package that up and give to any other search engine that

630
00:39:34,545 --> 00:39:38,385
Speaker 6:  wants it for, I believe the phrase is a marginal cost. What is that cost?

631
00:39:39,165 --> 00:39:41,865
Speaker 6:  No one knows. It's up to some committee that will get appointed and Google

632
00:39:41,915 --> 00:39:45,265
Speaker 6:  would like a lot more clarification about that. But Google's argument is

633
00:39:45,265 --> 00:39:49,145
Speaker 6:  essentially we have spent 25 years building this and

634
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:53,265
Speaker 6:  now you just want us to hand it to anybody with $10 and

635
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:57,425
Speaker 6:  a designer and they can just have Google and the DOJ is like, yes, that

636
00:39:57,425 --> 00:40:00,265
Speaker 6:  is exactly precisely what we are trying to do. David,

637
00:40:00,325 --> 00:40:03,345
Speaker 7:  Do you think that, is that the like we're gonna ask for too much and then

638
00:40:03,365 --> 00:40:06,345
Speaker 7:  get a step back? Or do you think they like legitimately are like, no, this

639
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:09,865
Speaker 7:  is, this is the thing we want and this is the thing we should have happen.

640
00:40:10,605 --> 00:40:14,145
Speaker 6:  So I think I still think Chrome is the ask for too much

641
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:18,225
Speaker 6:  move. Oh, interesting. I think, I think Chrome is more

642
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:22,345
Speaker 6:  like the DOJI think is more serious about selling Chrome than I expected.

643
00:40:22,445 --> 00:40:26,025
Speaker 6:  But I think if, if the DOJ was gonna give one of these up, it would be that

644
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:29,905
Speaker 6:  one. But I think the, the argument that the government makes

645
00:40:30,005 --> 00:40:33,945
Speaker 6:  is essentially that if you just level the playing field

646
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:37,865
Speaker 6:  starting now and you say, okay, everyone starting today has to play by the

647
00:40:37,865 --> 00:40:41,785
Speaker 6:  same rules. Google is so far ahead that it doesn't

648
00:40:41,785 --> 00:40:44,185
Speaker 6:  matter, right? Like you're, you're starting a marathon and you're saying

649
00:40:44,185 --> 00:40:47,345
Speaker 6:  you're both running a marathon, but Google gets to start 25 and a half miles

650
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:50,985
Speaker 6:  ahead, but you can both run as fast as you want. Now it's like that's not

651
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:55,145
Speaker 6:  a fair race. And so what what Google is saying is, well, okay,

652
00:40:55,145 --> 00:40:58,465
Speaker 6:  you're actually, you're giving all of our competitors a giant leg up

653
00:40:58,895 --> 00:41:02,785
Speaker 6:  just because we're a monopoly. And, and the DOJ is saying

654
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:06,665
Speaker 6:  yes, that is the only way to rectify this thing that we're doing. So I, I

655
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:10,585
Speaker 6:  wondered if it was one of the things that the DOJ would be willing to get

656
00:41:10,585 --> 00:41:14,105
Speaker 6:  rid of, but listening to them talk about it, they're like, no, this is not

657
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:17,225
Speaker 6:  just about stopping the monopoly, it's about rectifying the monopoly. Like

658
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:21,185
Speaker 6:  we have to, they kept using the, the phrase antitrust antifreeze,

659
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:24,785
Speaker 6:  which I hate and it's a bad metaphor. And like they should stop. They were

660
00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:25,625
Speaker 6:  like, they like

661
00:41:25,675 --> 00:41:26,185
Speaker 7:  Print on

662
00:41:26,265 --> 00:41:29,505
Speaker 6:  T-shirts. It is, it's awful. They're like, it's what does that mean? So the

663
00:41:29,505 --> 00:41:33,285
Speaker 6:  idea is Google's conduct froze all of its competitors and, and

664
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:36,565
Speaker 6:  basically like put a freeze on the search engine market. And they were like,

665
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:40,405
Speaker 6:  I I think it was David Alquist who was like, we wanna, we don't want to just,

666
00:41:40,825 --> 00:41:44,565
Speaker 6:  you know, put the block of ice out to thaw. We wanna light a fire under it.

667
00:41:44,565 --> 00:41:47,205
Speaker 6:  And then somebody else came up and he was like, antitrust antifreeze. And

668
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:50,045
Speaker 6:  I was like, guys, this isn't it. Like this isn't, this isn't doing

669
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:52,565
Speaker 5:  What you can is I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I mean I'm this person and

670
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:55,325
Speaker 5:  this is our audience, I'm just gonna go for it. That's not how melting and

671
00:41:55,485 --> 00:41:56,005
Speaker 5:  freezing things work.

672
00:41:57,635 --> 00:42:01,285
Speaker 5:  Like you don't pour anti-freeze on ice to make it not

673
00:42:02,505 --> 00:42:05,965
Speaker 5:  No, you you, you actually, you just whatever. Okay, good job government.

674
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:07,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah, you're doing great. But

675
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:11,005
Speaker 6:  Anyway, so all of this is to say, I think that that

676
00:42:11,005 --> 00:42:14,925
Speaker 6:  piece of it and, and what I left the courthouse wondering and I'm, I'm

677
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:18,805
Speaker 6:  curious what y'all think of this is if there is a middle ground in that one,

678
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:22,645
Speaker 6:  if there is a way to like give some of its competitors

679
00:42:22,965 --> 00:42:26,485
Speaker 6:  a leg up so that they can compete without just making Google handover

680
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:31,125
Speaker 6:  25 years of trade secrets in order to

681
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:33,725
Speaker 6:  prop up anyone who wants to build a search engine. Because like literally

682
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:36,845
Speaker 6:  the way the DOJ is framing this is that like the three of us

683
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,765
Speaker 6:  could design a front end with a search box

684
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:44,805
Speaker 6:  and then just like pipe in a Google API and be and and and we would have

685
00:42:44,805 --> 00:42:48,645
Speaker 6:  Google like that. It's, it's not all the way that, but It is

686
00:42:48,645 --> 00:42:49,725
Speaker 6:  pretty damn close to that.

687
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:53,045
Speaker 5:  Well their, their idea is that we would pay Google some fee

688
00:42:53,495 --> 00:42:53,845
Speaker 6:  Right?

689
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:57,685
Speaker 5:  For that service and then we would have to then figure out a business model

690
00:42:58,545 --> 00:43:01,675
Speaker 5:  that made us paying that fee to Google worth it. Right? Like what they want

691
00:43:01,675 --> 00:43:05,515
Speaker 5:  is competition on that layer. Like there should be competition search engines

692
00:43:05,935 --> 00:43:09,715
Speaker 5:  and there can't be right now because no one has the clickstream from

693
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:12,835
Speaker 5:  Google. No one has the raw volume of search data.

694
00:43:13,655 --> 00:43:16,075
Speaker 5:  So you gotta get that somehow Google can give it to you and then you can

695
00:43:16,075 --> 00:43:20,035
Speaker 5:  have con like then KA can be better or whatever. Right? Right. Like that

696
00:43:20,035 --> 00:43:23,875
Speaker 5:  feels hard for a variety of reasons. 'cause no one knows the other

697
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:27,895
Speaker 5:  business model is, the thing that gets me is, and you,

698
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:31,295
Speaker 5:  you hear this now from a lot of antitrust people on both sides of the aisle

699
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:35,935
Speaker 5:  and it's fascinating that this is the Trump DOJ basically

700
00:43:35,935 --> 00:43:39,875
Speaker 5:  saying the same things Jonathan Cantor was saying, we can't just

701
00:43:39,975 --> 00:43:43,435
Speaker 5:  fix the problem now we have to change it so it doesn't happen again. We have

702
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:47,235
Speaker 5:  to go back in time and unwind some of this. I think they call it a flywheel,

703
00:43:47,235 --> 00:43:50,635
Speaker 5:  right? You have Chrome, you collect all the click data from Chrome that feeds

704
00:43:50,635 --> 00:43:53,475
Speaker 5:  into search, you get better search, you know, click data from search, you

705
00:43:53,475 --> 00:43:57,315
Speaker 5:  direct traffic to webs. Like that's the problem. It's very hard for any

706
00:43:57,555 --> 00:44:01,075
Speaker 5:  external company to just like replace one part of that. So you gotta break

707
00:44:01,075 --> 00:44:04,795
Speaker 5:  the whole thing up, right? But the real issue, and you just hear this a lot,

708
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:08,905
Speaker 5:  is the complicated. You have to

709
00:44:08,905 --> 00:44:12,625
Speaker 5:  behave this way and we're gonna watch you to make sure you, you act better

710
00:44:13,165 --> 00:44:16,465
Speaker 5:  is really hard, especially for the government. 'cause presidents come and

711
00:44:16,465 --> 00:44:19,305
Speaker 5:  go, people come and go like it's

712
00:44:20,415 --> 00:44:24,225
Speaker 5:  private companies, especially huge private companies are very clever and

713
00:44:24,225 --> 00:44:27,185
Speaker 5:  motivated in finding ways out of the compliance rules that they were put

714
00:44:27,185 --> 00:44:30,705
Speaker 5:  in front of. And so breaking up the company, the

715
00:44:30,855 --> 00:44:34,245
Speaker 5:  quote structural remedy is just simpler.

716
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And now the argument that I, I've heard like

717
00:44:38,925 --> 00:44:42,605
Speaker 5:  FTC commissioners who are coming on decoder next week, the argument they're

718
00:44:42,605 --> 00:44:46,105
Speaker 5:  making is it's actually more democratic. It, it takes the government outta

719
00:44:46,105 --> 00:44:50,025
Speaker 5:  your business. We just send Chrome off into the woods or

720
00:44:50,035 --> 00:44:53,825
Speaker 5:  you'd sell Instagram and then that's a different company and we're done

721
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:57,625
Speaker 5:  like the government's outta your hair as opposed to we're gonna watch your

722
00:44:57,625 --> 00:45:00,545
Speaker 5:  every move, which you kind of like the Trump administration is like, what

723
00:45:00,545 --> 00:45:03,425
Speaker 5:  if we watched your every move? Right? Like they, they have an in, they have

724
00:45:03,425 --> 00:45:07,385
Speaker 5:  an in inclination to be like up in your business. And so you, there's a little

725
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:11,185
Speaker 5:  bit of a flip there, but I don't know if make the

726
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:14,625
Speaker 5:  API interoperable make search interoperable

727
00:45:15,455 --> 00:45:18,745
Speaker 5:  will play because Google will just preference itself again, they'll find

728
00:45:18,825 --> 00:45:21,745
Speaker 5:  a way to do it. They'll come to some settlement agreement and say, okay,

729
00:45:21,745 --> 00:45:25,025
Speaker 5:  our Google search experience is still slightly better than the one we sell

730
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:25,705
Speaker 5:  to Microsoft.

731
00:45:26,135 --> 00:45:29,985
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Which I think one of the, one of the other things that DOJ really

732
00:45:29,985 --> 00:45:33,865
Speaker 6:  wants is that the, the sort of cloud

733
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:37,425
Speaker 6:  they get to put over Google's head if they don't comply with all of these

734
00:45:37,605 --> 00:45:41,185
Speaker 6:  things and all and like live under the remedies correctly, is to have to

735
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:45,105
Speaker 6:  sell Android. Like that's that's the, that's the

736
00:45:45,265 --> 00:45:46,625
Speaker 6:  thing for non-compliance,

737
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:48,505
Speaker 5:  That's like in case of emergency.

738
00:45:49,015 --> 00:45:52,945
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And, and so I came to realize over the course of this that like they

739
00:45:52,945 --> 00:45:56,185
Speaker 6:  picked the biggest possible hammer that they could

740
00:45:56,965 --> 00:46:00,865
Speaker 6:  in order to say, okay, if, if we don't think, and again, it's all very

741
00:46:00,865 --> 00:46:04,745
Speaker 6:  nebulous. It's like if a, if just a bunch of people who have not yet been

742
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:07,865
Speaker 6:  named decide that you're not doing a good enough job and Google is like,

743
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:11,785
Speaker 6:  we have questions about all of that, but they, they're like,

744
00:46:11,785 --> 00:46:15,745
Speaker 6:  their compliance rule is Android and, and that is the, that is the real wow.

745
00:46:16,095 --> 00:46:18,465
Speaker 6:  Huge hammer hanging over Google if it goes through

746
00:46:19,005 --> 00:46:22,465
Speaker 5:  My hottest take here is that in 36 months, Google as we know, it does not

747
00:46:22,465 --> 00:46:22,705
Speaker 5:  exist.

748
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:23,985
Speaker 6:  It sure seems like it.

749
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:27,105
Speaker 5:  Like whether it's the government that does it, whether Google reconfigures

750
00:46:27,105 --> 00:46:30,665
Speaker 5:  itself somehow, whether the thing that sort of happened to Microsoft

751
00:46:31,165 --> 00:46:35,105
Speaker 5:  in the nineties happens, like Microsoft had all these cases and

752
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:38,825
Speaker 5:  all these, but they, Microsoft ended with a big consent decree. They were

753
00:46:38,835 --> 00:46:42,705
Speaker 5:  going to break up Microsoft into, I think they called it Apco and,

754
00:46:42,765 --> 00:46:46,665
Speaker 5:  and Osco, which is horrible names Apco is the one that it

755
00:46:46,665 --> 00:46:50,025
Speaker 5:  was like on the cover of time, like what's apco? It's like very silly.

756
00:46:51,325 --> 00:46:53,945
Speaker 5:  And then the, you know, George Bush got elected,

757
00:46:55,335 --> 00:46:58,955
Speaker 5:  the Clinton DOJ went away and they settled the case with this big consent

758
00:46:58,975 --> 00:47:02,365
Speaker 5:  decree. And that said, Microsoft had to

759
00:47:03,025 --> 00:47:06,405
Speaker 5:  not preference its own apps and stuff on Windows. And that just led to like

760
00:47:06,405 --> 00:47:10,125
Speaker 5:  years of headaches that allowed like Google to exist and Apple to make this

761
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:13,165
Speaker 5:  like roaring comeback on the strength of the open web, which is the only

762
00:47:13,165 --> 00:47:16,645
Speaker 5:  reason the iMac is any good. Like Apple came back because the web browser

763
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:19,005
Speaker 5:  supplanted windows as an app platform.

764
00:47:20,535 --> 00:47:23,435
Speaker 5:  Now we have Apple, but if that hadn't happened, why would you buy an iMac?

765
00:47:23,435 --> 00:47:27,195
Speaker 5:  Right? So all of that happened because Microsoft was kind of distracted and

766
00:47:27,195 --> 00:47:29,605
Speaker 5:  then Bill Gates will tell you that's why they missed mobile. Although I don't

767
00:47:29,605 --> 00:47:33,005
Speaker 5:  think that's the case at all. I saw their mobile phones, you know,

768
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:38,675
Speaker 5:  I'm just wondering like 36 months from now, three years from now, what will

769
00:47:38,785 --> 00:47:42,275
Speaker 5:  have Google been distracted by Google is not like a monster of execution

770
00:47:42,275 --> 00:47:45,555
Speaker 5:  right now. Yeah. So the government breaks it up, Google breaks itself up,

771
00:47:45,565 --> 00:47:48,435
Speaker 5:  Larry Page shows back up and is like, I don't know, spin off YouTube like

772
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:52,195
Speaker 5:  something is happening that changes this company as we know it in the next

773
00:47:52,195 --> 00:47:52,475
Speaker 5:  few years.

774
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:56,955
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think it's, it's possible that the big tech companies

775
00:47:56,975 --> 00:48:00,915
Speaker 6:  now just have like a different level of resources than any of

776
00:48:00,915 --> 00:48:04,555
Speaker 6:  those companies did back then. That they're so entrenched and so much bigger

777
00:48:04,895 --> 00:48:08,675
Speaker 6:  and have so much more money that they can, they can, you know, walk and chew

778
00:48:08,675 --> 00:48:11,555
Speaker 6:  gum at the same time in that respect. But it also, I mean to your point,

779
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,315
Speaker 6:  we we're seeing it now, right? Like Google is already not

780
00:48:15,945 --> 00:48:19,155
Speaker 6:  operating at full capacity because it has been fighting these fights

781
00:48:20,055 --> 00:48:23,875
Speaker 6:  and, and you see, you see leadership is changing and moving around

782
00:48:23,895 --> 00:48:27,595
Speaker 6:  in this company is like relentlessly trying to figure out what kind of company

783
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:31,515
Speaker 6:  it's supposed to be, which is a lot as all of

784
00:48:31,515 --> 00:48:35,315
Speaker 6:  this is happening. And of course Google's argument is that AI is that thing,

785
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:39,115
Speaker 6:  right? Like what, what the web and what mobile were to Microsoft then

786
00:48:40,295 --> 00:48:41,675
Speaker 6:  AI is now and

787
00:48:41,675 --> 00:48:45,035
Speaker 5:  They're running the same playbook. Yeah. It says in the trial it was revealed

788
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:48,995
Speaker 5:  that Google is paying Samsung an enormous sum to Preinstall

789
00:48:49,055 --> 00:48:51,475
Speaker 5:  Gemini. Yep. Like they're just doing what they do.

790
00:48:51,785 --> 00:48:55,595
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And, and so the DOJ is like, no, we have to stop Google

791
00:48:55,595 --> 00:48:59,035
Speaker 6:  from doing this so that it doesn't do it again. And Google is like, well,

792
00:48:59,245 --> 00:49:02,985
Speaker 6:  Chatt PT is doing just fine. And so that,

793
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:06,265
Speaker 6:  that isn't a real problem. Like this is the fastest growing

794
00:49:07,065 --> 00:49:11,005
Speaker 6:  consumer technology in history and Google is not getting

795
00:49:11,025 --> 00:49:14,085
Speaker 6:  in its way. So I think where, where that shakes out in this trial is gonna

796
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:17,685
Speaker 6:  be really fascinating. But there's been a lot more AI already in court

797
00:49:17,795 --> 00:49:21,765
Speaker 6:  than we expected. Like the very first witness after opening arguments was

798
00:49:21,765 --> 00:49:24,765
Speaker 6:  an AI expert who literally just spent like an hour and a half explaining

799
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:28,725
Speaker 6:  terms about AI to the court, which I thought was so interesting. I

800
00:49:28,725 --> 00:49:31,845
Speaker 7:  Might be jumping ahead a little bit here, but the AI thing is really fascinating

801
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:35,805
Speaker 7:  when it comes to Chrome because the big companies to be like, oh, I buy Chrome.

802
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:39,725
Speaker 7:  They're AI companies. They're all looking for a

803
00:49:39,725 --> 00:49:43,685
Speaker 7:  gateway in, and those gateways are, they're Google

804
00:49:43,725 --> 00:49:47,125
Speaker 7:  products, right? It is Chrome. It is Google's search index.

805
00:49:48,555 --> 00:49:52,325
Speaker 7:  They would leap at this opportunity because Google is

806
00:49:52,325 --> 00:49:55,405
Speaker 7:  still the gatekeeper. They're still the biggest surface.

807
00:49:56,915 --> 00:49:59,485
Speaker 7:  They're winning because they keep putting their own stuff on that surface.

808
00:49:59,865 --> 00:50:02,885
Speaker 7:  And I think these AI companies know no matter how good their product is,

809
00:50:03,105 --> 00:50:05,005
Speaker 7:  you just cannot replace that.

810
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:08,665
Speaker 5:  Well, it's true. You said that the big AI companies, I just want to peel

811
00:50:08,665 --> 00:50:12,465
Speaker 5:  that apart a little bit. One, one, OpenAI said they would buy Chrome,

812
00:50:13,185 --> 00:50:16,465
Speaker 5:  and they said that in court, right? David? Or they filed a, the document

813
00:50:16,545 --> 00:50:20,425
Speaker 5:  saying they would do it and then Perplexity, which is just a very different

814
00:50:20,425 --> 00:50:23,985
Speaker 5:  scale than OpenAI was like, yeah, we'll do it too. But they perplexity is

815
00:50:23,985 --> 00:50:25,225
Speaker 5:  also like, we'll buy TikTok. Yeah.

816
00:50:25,225 --> 00:50:26,705
Speaker 7:  Perplexity is is a SPAC

817
00:50:26,705 --> 00:50:30,685
Speaker 6:  With an AI arm attached. Like they, they, they will buy Peloton

818
00:50:30,685 --> 00:50:31,645
Speaker 6:  if it comes up for sale.

819
00:50:32,545 --> 00:50:35,725
Speaker 5:  So look, I don't know if Plexy can afford it. I don't know if Plexy can afford

820
00:50:35,745 --> 00:50:38,805
Speaker 5:  TikTok. They do have some revenue. I tweet any revenue. It is a joke. They

821
00:50:38,805 --> 00:50:41,925
Speaker 5:  do have some revenue that's growing, but open eyes, the the big dog. Yeah.

822
00:50:42,015 --> 00:50:45,765
Speaker 5:  Right. They, Sam Altman's like, what if I had a trillion dollars? And a lot

823
00:50:45,765 --> 00:50:48,125
Speaker 5:  of people are like, what if you did amazing?

824
00:50:49,765 --> 00:50:53,655
Speaker 5:  What they would get is distribution, which is the thing they all

825
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:57,455
Speaker 5:  need, Right? If you're up against Apple on the iPhone

826
00:50:57,475 --> 00:51:01,095
Speaker 5:  and Apple can just be like, you're gonna use Siri until we make it good,

827
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:05,735
Speaker 5:  you're kind of stuck, right? But if you're in Chrome literally

828
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:09,535
Speaker 5:  looking at all of the webpage that people are using and all of the

829
00:51:09,595 --> 00:51:12,775
Speaker 5:  things they are typing into all of the text boxes across the internet,

830
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:17,335
Speaker 5:  well, you have a lot of power, right? That's, that's huge. And then you

831
00:51:17,335 --> 00:51:21,215
Speaker 5:  can put the AI system or the chatbot right in front of all the users all

832
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:24,375
Speaker 5:  the time, which is stuff other browser makers afraid. Like that's basically

833
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:27,815
Speaker 5:  what the ARC browser is going to become, right? Yeah. Who else could buy

834
00:51:27,815 --> 00:51:28,055
Speaker 5:  Chrome?

835
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:32,455
Speaker 6:  Well, it, it was really interesting listening to the lawyers

836
00:51:32,555 --> 00:51:36,095
Speaker 6:  in opening arguments, try and make the case that Chrome is a really good

837
00:51:36,295 --> 00:51:38,615
Speaker 6:  business. Because the thing Google says, and the thing I've heard a bunch

838
00:51:38,715 --> 00:51:42,375
Speaker 6:  is the browser business as a standalone business

839
00:51:42,695 --> 00:51:46,535
Speaker 6:  actually really sucks that a browser has lots of value

840
00:51:46,755 --> 00:51:50,415
Speaker 6:  and is hugely useful. And the, like you said, the distribution is ridiculous.

841
00:51:51,235 --> 00:51:54,175
Speaker 6:  The, the do j's estimation was that Chrome has four and a half billion users,

842
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:58,335
Speaker 6:  which is, would make it the biggest platform on the

843
00:51:58,495 --> 00:52:00,055
Speaker 6:  internet by like a pretty wide margin.

844
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:06,105
Speaker 6:  But people don't pay for browsers. They

845
00:52:06,105 --> 00:52:08,905
Speaker 6:  put up a thing where they were like, here's how you monetize. And the first

846
00:52:08,905 --> 00:52:12,625
Speaker 6:  thing they came up with was ads, like the, the Mozilla Firefox

847
00:52:12,765 --> 00:52:16,065
Speaker 6:  ads that you see. And I'm just sitting there in, in listening to this being

848
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:19,145
Speaker 6:  like, yeah, and how's that going from Mozilla, which gets all of its money

849
00:52:19,145 --> 00:52:22,545
Speaker 6:  from a Google default search deal. Like it's just,

850
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:26,345
Speaker 6:  that is very hard to pull off. And then they came around to,

851
00:52:27,095 --> 00:52:31,025
Speaker 6:  well, what if a, what if an AI company just took

852
00:52:31,025 --> 00:52:34,905
Speaker 6:  out the Google search box and put in their chat bot? And that

853
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:39,025
Speaker 6:  is the answer. It's, it's the only way, right? Like it becomes the thing

854
00:52:39,025 --> 00:52:42,585
Speaker 6:  that I use to interact with chat GPT that I spend

855
00:52:42,585 --> 00:52:46,545
Speaker 6:  $20 for, right? It's, it's, it's different than

856
00:52:46,545 --> 00:52:50,185
Speaker 6:  It is for Google because it doesn't, like you, there's nowhere that you pay

857
00:52:50,185 --> 00:52:53,905
Speaker 6:  money. Google's flywheel just exists sort of next to Chrome, and you access

858
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:57,865
Speaker 6:  it by constantly typing searches into the Chrome bar, which is why it's a

859
00:52:57,865 --> 00:53:01,825
Speaker 6:  perfect and unbeatable business. But that

860
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,225
Speaker 6:  is the whole pitch as far as I can tell, is, is it gives you

861
00:53:05,695 --> 00:53:09,145
Speaker 6:  massive distribution. It puts you in front of most of the

862
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:12,905
Speaker 6:  population of the Earth already. Even if it doesn't grow, it's like

863
00:53:13,405 --> 00:53:17,265
Speaker 6:  It is an unparalleled thing to just be able to put your

864
00:53:17,265 --> 00:53:20,545
Speaker 6:  stuff in front of it does, it gets you browsing data, it gets you all kinds

865
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:23,985
Speaker 6:  of stuff. But it, it, it will have to be in service of something else. And

866
00:53:23,985 --> 00:53:27,925
Speaker 6:  even the DOJ is like, this is not going to be a business by

867
00:53:27,925 --> 00:53:30,925
Speaker 6:  itself. You're not just gonna be able to start charging $10 a month for Chrome,

868
00:53:31,305 --> 00:53:35,245
Speaker 6:  and that's gonna work. Like they understand that it, it has to be

869
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:38,765
Speaker 6:  in service of another thing in order to work. And I found that really fascinating.

870
00:53:38,765 --> 00:53:39,045
Speaker 6:  Wait,

871
00:53:39,045 --> 00:53:42,125
Speaker 5:  It was just like, it's funny, we, you can do the TikTok exercise, you can

872
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:45,645
Speaker 5:  come up with this list of potential acquirers for TikTok

873
00:53:45,835 --> 00:53:49,605
Speaker 5:  that It is pretty vast, right? I think I, I keep putting Walmart on that

874
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:53,005
Speaker 5:  list. Like Walmart should buy TikTok and then the TikTok shop won't

875
00:53:53,515 --> 00:53:57,045
Speaker 5:  feel quite like being mugged and the way that it does today. Like, have you

876
00:53:57,045 --> 00:54:00,405
Speaker 5:  heard of Vivo? Or you will now, like there's something happening there that's

877
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:04,245
Speaker 5:  just dark. Yeah. And maybe Walmart can just like take it and run it and have

878
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:07,405
Speaker 5:  a young audience and compete with Amazon. Like you can build a pretty wide

879
00:54:07,405 --> 00:54:10,285
Speaker 5:  aperture for TikTok. I don't who buys Chrome?

880
00:54:11,285 --> 00:54:15,095
Speaker 5:  Is this just OpenAI and perplexity? Look, why would Apple buy

881
00:54:15,095 --> 00:54:15,335
Speaker 5:  Chrome?

882
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:19,745
Speaker 7:  I think Apple should buy Chrome. Hear me out. Really? Okay. Yeah. Safari

883
00:54:19,745 --> 00:54:23,465
Speaker 7:  is a garbage browser. Chrome is the probably the most used software on

884
00:54:23,525 --> 00:54:27,145
Speaker 7:  Mac, and It is the worst running piece of software on Mac. They fixed that.

885
00:54:27,215 --> 00:54:31,145
Speaker 7:  They've just doubled the battery life on MacBooks and who needs a

886
00:54:31,145 --> 00:54:34,785
Speaker 7:  surface for when they eventually have a good AI application? Apple?

887
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:38,545
Speaker 5:  Wait, they have the biggest surface in history. They have the iPhone.

888
00:54:39,695 --> 00:54:42,505
Speaker 7:  Yeah, but you put it on, put it on Chrome too. Now it's everywhere.

889
00:54:42,565 --> 00:54:45,305
Speaker 6:  You know what more people use than use iPhones? Neli.

890
00:54:45,485 --> 00:54:49,315
Speaker 5:  Is It, is it Chrome? Well, right, but Apple doesn't care. They're not, can

891
00:54:49,315 --> 00:54:52,995
Speaker 5:  you imagine whoever is Craig Feder being like, we gotta work on Windows

892
00:54:52,995 --> 00:54:54,355
Speaker 5:  Chrome, you guys, like, that's your job.

893
00:54:54,655 --> 00:54:58,515
Speaker 6:  The very funniest outcome here would be that Apple buys Chrome just

894
00:54:58,515 --> 00:55:02,115
Speaker 6:  to shut it down. And they claim it's in the ex in the interest of the user

895
00:55:02,115 --> 00:55:05,155
Speaker 6:  experience on the Mac, they're like, we don't want people using bad browsers

896
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,395
Speaker 6:  on Apple devices, so we're just gonna kill Chrome.

897
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:11,075
Speaker 5:  Like Yeah. Apple does not want the web to be a great application platform.

898
00:55:11,235 --> 00:55:14,875
Speaker 5:  'cause they want iOS to be their application platform. Yeah. Like they,

899
00:55:15,025 --> 00:55:18,835
Speaker 5:  that there's a, there's something happening with Safari that is often

900
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:22,715
Speaker 5:  overlooked, but it's like Safari just has a wall of

901
00:55:22,715 --> 00:55:26,555
Speaker 5:  capabilities that prevents web apps from competing with iOS apps. It's like,

902
00:55:26,565 --> 00:55:30,435
Speaker 5:  again, I I hear you. I I, I bought a a, a Mac

903
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:34,155
Speaker 5:  studio just to run Chrome 10 years from now, it'll still be running

904
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:35,515
Speaker 5:  Chrome, but not well. Yep.

905
00:55:36,175 --> 00:55:39,515
Speaker 7:  And listen, they're gonna need to build a search engine once those search

906
00:55:39,515 --> 00:55:43,195
Speaker 7:  deal exclusivity, that exclusivity cash stops coming through

907
00:55:43,655 --> 00:55:44,075
Speaker 7:  Chrome.

908
00:55:44,135 --> 00:55:47,395
Speaker 5:  So, but that may, that's a, that's an argument to license Google.

909
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:51,915
Speaker 5:  If you're Apple, you can quickly, and all this goes through, you can

910
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:55,875
Speaker 5:  quickly build a, a better, more interesting search product

911
00:55:55,905 --> 00:55:59,795
Speaker 5:  into Spotlight or Siri or whatever because you have the backend of

912
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:03,075
Speaker 5:  Google to support it in a way that has to be interoperable. It doesn't mean

913
00:56:03,075 --> 00:56:03,675
Speaker 5:  you have to buy Chrome.

914
00:56:04,575 --> 00:56:06,835
Speaker 7:  I'm not saying this is all let's wise decision.

915
00:56:07,105 --> 00:56:09,115
Speaker 5:  Okay. So that, but that's the argument, Jake, that's, that's

916
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:09,195
Speaker 7:  The

917
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:13,595
Speaker 5:  Ly made the argument, which was increase the better left on MacBook. Yeah.

918
00:56:13,615 --> 00:56:14,475
Speaker 5:  Mi Microsoft

919
00:56:15,835 --> 00:56:19,235
Speaker 6:  Wouldn't work the, I mean, they, they even said in court,

920
00:56:19,675 --> 00:56:23,565
Speaker 6:  Microsoft meta, Amazon basically

921
00:56:23,705 --> 00:56:24,925
Speaker 6:  out for antitrust reasons.

922
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:28,505
Speaker 5:  Who can buy What is, I don't understand this. I,

923
00:56:28,565 --> 00:56:32,385
Speaker 6:  It literally, the, the longer I think about this, the more it might literally

924
00:56:32,495 --> 00:56:36,485
Speaker 6:  just be open ai. Like you, there's a really interesting

925
00:56:36,485 --> 00:56:37,045
Speaker 6:  case to

926
00:56:37,045 --> 00:56:40,845
Speaker 5:  Be made. Like I'm just like naming big companies Exxon. Like

927
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:42,085
Speaker 5:  what, what It

928
00:56:42,325 --> 00:56:43,365
Speaker 6:  Becomes the rivian ex

929
00:56:43,555 --> 00:56:44,165
Speaker 5:  Exclusive

930
00:56:44,165 --> 00:56:48,045
Speaker 6:  Browser. No, I think there's a, there's an interesting case to be made that

931
00:56:48,145 --> 00:56:51,885
Speaker 6:  if all of this goes against Google, the single company that stands to benefit

932
00:56:52,025 --> 00:56:55,845
Speaker 6:  the most is OpenAI. And it, it, it

933
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:59,805
Speaker 6:  has the cash to do it. It doesn't have the antitrust worries to do

934
00:56:59,805 --> 00:56:59,965
Speaker 6:  it,

935
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:04,245
Speaker 6:  it, it can raise money infinitely. Clearly.

936
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:09,325
Speaker 6:  It would hugely benefit from access to Google's search data.

937
00:57:09,945 --> 00:57:13,645
Speaker 6:  One of the things that one an OpenAI person said in

938
00:57:13,645 --> 00:57:17,125
Speaker 6:  deposition was basically it's, you can get to

939
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:21,045
Speaker 6:  80% of Google's search quality pretty easily, and the last

940
00:57:21,045 --> 00:57:24,565
Speaker 6:  20% is virtually impossible and

941
00:57:25,035 --> 00:57:28,605
Speaker 6:  just absolutely impossibly expensive. And this is the thing I've heard from

942
00:57:28,605 --> 00:57:31,085
Speaker 6:  anyone who wants to build search. You can build a pretty good search engine

943
00:57:31,585 --> 00:57:35,005
Speaker 6:  by yourself, but to the difference between a pretty good and a

944
00:57:35,225 --> 00:57:39,165
Speaker 6:  Google level search engine is many years and hundreds of

945
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:41,925
Speaker 6:  billions of dollars or Google is forced to give it to you, right? Yeah. And

946
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:45,565
Speaker 6:  so OpenAI immediately starts to solve that

947
00:57:45,565 --> 00:57:49,005
Speaker 6:  quality gap, maybe gets a browser out of it and suddenly

948
00:57:49,275 --> 00:57:53,205
Speaker 6:  goes from having, not distribution problems, but like it has to win

949
00:57:53,225 --> 00:57:56,965
Speaker 6:  its distribution to suddenly just having it and like,

950
00:57:57,345 --> 00:58:01,285
Speaker 6:  it, it, it would be in a very funny way, raising one competitor

951
00:58:01,425 --> 00:58:04,725
Speaker 6:  in particular out of all of this. Like up to Google's level.

952
00:58:04,955 --> 00:58:08,725
Speaker 5:  It's just funny that like literally at TikTok, I can make an argument for

953
00:58:08,725 --> 00:58:12,485
Speaker 5:  almost any company to buy tiktoks. Yeah. Sun Kiss should buy TikTok.

954
00:58:12,485 --> 00:58:16,285
Speaker 5:  Like, fine, give me enough time. I'll get there. And the Orange company should

955
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:20,125
Speaker 5:  buy TikTok. It's hard to make an argument for any company to buy Chrome

956
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:23,885
Speaker 5:  because the business model doesn't make a lot of sense. You

957
00:58:23,885 --> 00:58:27,685
Speaker 6:  Can sort of make a like browsing data argument that

958
00:58:27,745 --> 00:58:31,725
Speaker 6:  is interesting, but not at the price it would cost to

959
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:34,725
Speaker 6:  get it, right? Like having access to everyone's browsing data

960
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:38,965
Speaker 6:  is very valuable and would be to lots of people. But I think

961
00:58:39,705 --> 00:58:43,405
Speaker 6:  buying and running Chrome is probably not the most efficient way to get

962
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:44,165
Speaker 6:  there,

963
00:58:44,545 --> 00:58:48,525
Speaker 5:  Or at least the way that Google runs Chrome, which to its credit is in a

964
00:58:49,035 --> 00:58:52,845
Speaker 5:  like, reasonably open way. Like I

965
00:58:52,965 --> 00:58:56,125
Speaker 5:  think people think of web browsers, like document viewers, but they're actually

966
00:58:56,125 --> 00:59:00,005
Speaker 5:  application platforms. They're little operating systems now, right? They

967
00:59:00,005 --> 00:59:03,845
Speaker 5:  have different memory between tabs. Your apps are literally running them

968
00:59:03,845 --> 00:59:07,365
Speaker 5:  and obviously in the cloud as well. Like that's where apps run on desktop

969
00:59:07,565 --> 00:59:10,685
Speaker 5:  computers for most people. And Google has to manage that.

970
00:59:11,605 --> 00:59:14,095
Speaker 5:  They have a commitment to the web being open, which is good.

971
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:19,345
Speaker 5:  If you buy Chrome, you don't have to do any of that. You

972
00:59:19,345 --> 00:59:22,805
Speaker 5:  can just say your app will run even better in Chrome if you pay us some money.

973
00:59:23,195 --> 00:59:25,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And like, there's all these other things you could do to make that

974
00:59:25,965 --> 00:59:27,005
Speaker 5:  money, which seemed bad.

975
00:59:27,265 --> 00:59:31,005
Speaker 6:  And in addition to offloading Chrome, the government wants Google

976
00:59:31,065 --> 00:59:34,645
Speaker 6:  to offload the Chromium project, which is, it's, it's

977
00:59:34,795 --> 00:59:38,125
Speaker 6:  like ostensibly but not really open source

978
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:41,485
Speaker 6:  browser project that it oversees and funds and

979
00:59:42,115 --> 00:59:45,725
Speaker 6:  also powers every other browser that you probably use at this point. Like

980
00:59:46,755 --> 00:59:50,405
Speaker 6:  Edge is chromium, arc is chromium, brave is

981
00:59:50,555 --> 00:59:54,485
Speaker 6:  like, they're everything on the web at this point except

982
00:59:54,485 --> 00:59:56,205
Speaker 6:  for Safari and kind of Firefox

983
00:59:58,255 --> 01:00:01,475
Speaker 6:  is chromium. And so you end up at this point where like we're, we would be

984
01:00:02,355 --> 01:00:06,035
Speaker 6:  changing the way that like the underlying infrastructure of how people use

985
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:09,795
Speaker 6:  the internet belongs to somebody else. And like, maybe there's a devil,

986
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:13,835
Speaker 6:  you know, devil you don't thing going on here, but like for all of its

987
01:00:13,835 --> 01:00:17,755
Speaker 6:  flaws, Google has been a pretty good steward of browsers

988
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:21,615
Speaker 6:  over the years. Yeah. We, we give Chrome a lot of crap. But like

989
01:00:22,555 --> 01:00:26,535
Speaker 6:  the reason web chat is very good and video

990
01:00:26,535 --> 01:00:29,735
Speaker 6:  looks really great in your browser is in large part thanks to work that Google

991
01:00:29,795 --> 01:00:32,575
Speaker 6:  did and then gave to the ecosystem. Like that stuff is, that stuff matters.

992
01:00:33,085 --> 01:00:36,775
Speaker 5:  It's funny 'cause they, the reason they did that was to ensure

993
01:00:37,235 --> 01:00:40,695
Speaker 5:  Google search could see everyone's data. Well, sure. Right? Like Yeah. I

994
01:00:40,695 --> 01:00:43,975
Speaker 5:  mean that this idea, I mean like they're, they were always aligned. Yeah.

995
01:00:44,075 --> 01:00:48,055
Speaker 5:  The alignment was good for the most part. Like let's build open web platforms

996
01:00:48,055 --> 01:00:50,855
Speaker 5:  for everything and make sure everything is standards compliant also, that

997
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:54,695
Speaker 5:  will ensure that our systems can crawl everything and see everything. Right?

998
01:00:55,145 --> 01:00:58,935
Speaker 5:  Great. And now we're just like, if you break that apart, maybe, maybe

999
01:00:58,935 --> 01:01:01,735
Speaker 5:  there's not so, so much incentive for things to be happen. I have no idea

1000
01:01:01,735 --> 01:01:04,415
Speaker 5:  what's gonna happen here. I just think it's fascinating that, I mean, I don't

1001
01:01:04,415 --> 01:01:06,815
Speaker 5:  know what's gonna happen with TikTok either. It's just really interesting

1002
01:01:07,485 --> 01:01:11,335
Speaker 5:  that you should buy and run TikTok seems like a simpler problem than you

1003
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:14,655
Speaker 5:  should run Chrome, which does not have like content

1004
01:01:14,665 --> 01:01:18,255
Speaker 5:  moderation issues or like the Chinese government hating

1005
01:01:18,255 --> 01:01:21,775
Speaker 5:  Donald Trump issue. Like, but it's like, oh, that's way harder. Like we should

1006
01:01:21,775 --> 01:01:22,335
Speaker 5:  buy TikTok.

1007
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:26,335
Speaker 7:  Is this because like TikTok, there's like a clear business model Chrome.

1008
01:01:26,755 --> 01:01:30,375
Speaker 7:  The business has to be something else, right? Like, unless you're just going

1009
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:34,055
Speaker 7:  to have a bunch of popups on every single new tab screen, like

1010
01:01:34,195 --> 01:01:37,695
Speaker 7:  you fundamentally need to have another business that you are boosting with

1011
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:41,455
Speaker 7:  Chrome, which means you just need to have a pretty good business

1012
01:01:41,455 --> 01:01:45,255
Speaker 7:  already that could use that distribution and you have to have a bunch of

1013
01:01:45,255 --> 01:01:48,335
Speaker 7:  extra cash. And that's just a really weird situation to be in. Maybe it's

1014
01:01:48,335 --> 01:01:51,255
Speaker 7:  Walmart. Every new tab screen is just a bunch of recommended products

1015
01:01:51,255 --> 01:01:51,615
Speaker 6:  To buy

1016
01:01:51,855 --> 01:01:53,375
Speaker 5:  Walmart at the end. Walmart buys,

1017
01:01:53,655 --> 01:01:55,135
Speaker 7:  Wait, wait, hear me out, tabula.

1018
01:01:55,835 --> 01:01:56,255
Speaker 6:  Oh God.

1019
01:01:56,435 --> 01:02:00,215
Speaker 5:  Oh, well that's the end of, that's the end of the internet, everybody. Okay.

1020
01:02:00,215 --> 01:02:03,535
Speaker 5:  So that's one trial. We, we know what's gonna happen that's ongoing. We're

1021
01:02:03,535 --> 01:02:06,415
Speaker 5:  gonna cover, keep covering that one really deeply, simultaneously

1022
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:11,275
Speaker 5:  in the same building meta's on trial. And that might

1023
01:02:11,275 --> 01:02:14,595
Speaker 5:  result in the breakup of Instagram and WhatsApp. I would say that one started

1024
01:02:14,595 --> 01:02:18,515
Speaker 5:  out sleepy. I I got a note today from an executive in

1025
01:02:18,515 --> 01:02:21,445
Speaker 5:  the industry says we, we complain too much about market definitions of Alex

1026
01:02:21,465 --> 01:02:25,405
Speaker 5:  eat last week. That it doesn't matter as much. The judges is gonna

1027
01:02:25,585 --> 01:02:29,085
Speaker 5:  decide whatever. And that it's the emails and Kevin

1028
01:02:29,405 --> 01:02:33,285
Speaker 5:  Strom on stage saying, meta tried to choke Instagram after it acquired it.

1029
01:02:33,435 --> 01:02:34,325
Speaker 5:  That will win the day.

1030
01:02:34,605 --> 01:02:38,245
Speaker 6:  I have done a 180 on this trial in the span of seven days.

1031
01:02:38,555 --> 01:02:39,325
Speaker 5:  Okay, tell me why

1032
01:02:39,845 --> 01:02:43,685
Speaker 6:  I left last week. Basically being like, the government

1033
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:47,805
Speaker 6:  doesn't know how, how to categorize meta and it's gonna tank

1034
01:02:47,905 --> 01:02:51,805
Speaker 6:  its case, right? Like meta is very deliberately all things to all people.

1035
01:02:51,865 --> 01:02:55,045
Speaker 6:  And that is a very hard thing to put a market definition on. And if you can't

1036
01:02:55,045 --> 01:02:58,845
Speaker 6:  have a good market definition, you can't call it a monopoly. And

1037
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:02,685
Speaker 6:  meta is not a monopoly on the internet. And so it's like that there was just

1038
01:03:02,685 --> 01:03:06,445
Speaker 6:  that fundamental disconnect that it was like, maybe, maybe the case

1039
01:03:06,445 --> 01:03:10,125
Speaker 6:  against Meta is going to hinge on wrapping its arms around meta. And that's

1040
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:14,085
Speaker 6:  gonna be very hard to do. But then Kevin Strom gets on

1041
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:17,645
Speaker 6:  the stand and just spends a day just

1042
01:03:18,605 --> 01:03:22,365
Speaker 6:  throwing darts at every other executive at Meta. Mark

1043
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,405
Speaker 6:  Zuckerberg in particular,

1044
01:03:23,405 --> 01:03:26,205
Speaker 5:  Kevin Strom, famously the founder of Instagram, one of the co-founders of

1045
01:03:26,205 --> 01:03:26,445
Speaker 5:  Instagram.

1046
01:03:26,445 --> 01:03:30,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Sold Instagram to Facebook, then called Facebook for a billion dollars.

1047
01:03:30,835 --> 01:03:34,165
Speaker 6:  Obviously Instagram is Instagram and

1048
01:03:34,715 --> 01:03:38,085
Speaker 6:  Mark Zuckerberg's argument before Kevin Sichem took the stand is essentially

1049
01:03:38,085 --> 01:03:42,045
Speaker 6:  that Instagram is only Instagram because of this company that we,

1050
01:03:42,505 --> 01:03:45,645
Speaker 6:  we have the resources, we poured fuel on the fire. It grew because of us,

1051
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:48,805
Speaker 6:  like on and on and on. And we talked last week about it's actually hard to

1052
01:03:48,805 --> 01:03:52,685
Speaker 6:  prove otherwise. And then Kevin Sichem came and sat on the stand and said

1053
01:03:52,685 --> 01:03:55,965
Speaker 6:  otherwise over and over and over again, that actually what happened was Instagram

1054
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:59,925
Speaker 6:  came aboard and was starved for resources that Mark Zuckerberg

1055
01:04:00,065 --> 01:04:03,685
Speaker 6:  saw Instagram as a threat. And so took stuff away from it in order to prevent

1056
01:04:03,685 --> 01:04:07,525
Speaker 6:  it from growing and killing Facebook. And, and this is a thing

1057
01:04:07,525 --> 01:04:11,325
Speaker 6:  we've heard kind of intermittently over the years is that like Mark Zuckerberg

1058
01:04:11,325 --> 01:04:15,245
Speaker 6:  runs a big company, but like Facebook is his special baby. And anything

1059
01:04:15,245 --> 01:04:17,885
Speaker 6:  that threatens the Facebook platform

1060
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:23,005
Speaker 6:  cannot be allowed to do that. Like that that tracks with what we know of

1061
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:26,845
Speaker 6:  his personality and history. That Facebook, the thing is more

1062
01:04:26,845 --> 01:04:29,565
Speaker 6:  important to him than anything else in his empire. And

1063
01:04:30,865 --> 01:04:34,805
Speaker 6:  so rum just gets up there and basically for like a whole day was just

1064
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:38,725
Speaker 6:  like Instagram was killing it. And then we continued to kill it more or

1065
01:04:38,725 --> 01:04:42,485
Speaker 6:  less in spite of the company that acquired us, which by the way got an

1066
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:43,925
Speaker 6:  unbelievably great deal in doing so.

1067
01:04:44,305 --> 01:04:46,845
Speaker 5:  Do you think Mark Zuckerberg uses Facebook? No.

1068
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:50,125
Speaker 6:  I mean, he posts on Facebook, but what is, what is there for him to use?

1069
01:04:50,195 --> 01:04:54,165
Speaker 6:  Like is he looking at all the AI generated memes? Like, because he's on

1070
01:04:54,165 --> 01:04:57,445
Speaker 5:  Marketplace. I've heard this thing that he loves Facebook and, and I'm sure

1071
01:04:57,445 --> 01:05:00,735
Speaker 5:  he loves the charts and graphs that say he's rich. You know,

1072
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:04,615
Speaker 5:  like Facebook makes so much money that when they think they're gonna have

1073
01:05:04,615 --> 01:05:08,455
Speaker 5:  a bad quarter, like PMs can just like turn knobs

1074
01:05:08,515 --> 01:05:12,335
Speaker 5:  to make the revenue targets. Like it's nuts. It it the scale and the

1075
01:05:12,335 --> 01:05:16,295
Speaker 5:  power of Facebook. But if you say to someone, I

1076
01:05:16,295 --> 01:05:20,125
Speaker 5:  heard someone say this today on the train, he sounds like

1077
01:05:20,225 --> 01:05:23,085
Speaker 5:  he reads a lot of Facebook. He sounds like he spends a lot of time on Facebook.

1078
01:05:23,225 --> 01:05:26,685
Speaker 5:  And I was like, I know exactly what that means and it's bad. Yeah, it's not

1079
01:05:26,685 --> 01:05:30,585
Speaker 5:  right, it's not good. And it's like, do you think Mark Berg is

1080
01:05:30,585 --> 01:05:34,465
Speaker 5:  just like Facebook brained? Like that would be horrible and that

1081
01:05:34,495 --> 01:05:38,185
Speaker 5:  it's whatever Instagram is, whatever it's becoming now

1082
01:05:38,455 --> 01:05:41,625
Speaker 5:  full of ai slap for a minute. It was cool,

1083
01:05:42,115 --> 01:05:46,105
Speaker 5:  right? And it still, it it still has a place in the culture. It's very

1084
01:05:46,105 --> 01:05:49,965
Speaker 5:  important. Yeah. In a way that Facebook, the only reason I use It is 'cause

1085
01:05:50,355 --> 01:05:52,365
Speaker 5:  like the parents group at the school is on Facebook.

1086
01:05:53,155 --> 01:05:56,565
Speaker 6:  Okay. But if I'm, if I'm gonna psychoanalyze Mark Zuckerberg here

1087
01:05:56,565 --> 01:05:59,965
Speaker 5:  For minute, also, sometimes I take I type Mustang in a marketplace and I

1088
01:05:59,965 --> 01:06:01,965
Speaker 5:  just think about the lives I could lead. That's it.

1089
01:06:02,035 --> 01:06:05,445
Speaker 6:  I've been shopping for patio furniture on marketplace and It is

1090
01:06:06,225 --> 01:06:06,965
Speaker 6:  not a great time.

1091
01:06:07,425 --> 01:06:10,405
Speaker 5:  I'm just saying if you wanna buy like a, a mid two thousands Terminator cobra,

1092
01:06:10,405 --> 01:06:12,165
Speaker 5:  you can find one on Facebook marketplace

1093
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:14,005
Speaker 5:  continue.

1094
01:06:14,505 --> 01:06:17,325
Speaker 6:  But okay, so if, if I'm gonna psychoanalyze Mark Zuckerberg for a second,

1095
01:06:17,325 --> 01:06:20,085
Speaker 6:  which feels dangerous. I think

1096
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:25,285
Speaker 6:  what is true of Facebook and meta at large

1097
01:06:25,465 --> 01:06:29,325
Speaker 6:  is that the, the wrap on the company is that all meta has ever done is,

1098
01:06:29,345 --> 01:06:33,285
Speaker 6:  is copy. That It is a very successful and ruthless fast follower,

1099
01:06:33,335 --> 01:06:37,125
Speaker 6:  right? That what It is in many ways is a collection of other

1100
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:40,965
Speaker 6:  people's good ideas executed on at larger scale except

1101
01:06:41,245 --> 01:06:44,965
Speaker 6:  Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg did Facebook. Right? Like that is, that is a real

1102
01:06:44,965 --> 01:06:48,245
Speaker 6:  thing that he holds onto. And I think if you're Mark Zuckerberg and you are

1103
01:06:48,245 --> 01:06:52,045
Speaker 6:  this like business tycoon who is sort of

1104
01:06:52,045 --> 01:06:55,845
Speaker 6:  known for being a monster, as much as you are like a

1105
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:56,605
Speaker 6:  great coder,

1106
01:06:58,325 --> 01:07:01,565
Speaker 6:  Facebook is the thing that you did. And I think that is forever really

1107
01:07:01,695 --> 01:07:05,525
Speaker 6:  meaningful to someone. Like he doesn't sure, he doesn't get credit for Instagram

1108
01:07:05,525 --> 01:07:08,125
Speaker 6:  the same way he doesn't deserve credit for Instagram the same way, same with

1109
01:07:08,285 --> 01:07:11,005
Speaker 6:  WhatsApp. Like those are part of his business empire, but they're not like

1110
01:07:11,005 --> 01:07:14,925
Speaker 6:  things that he did. And I think the the world sees it that way.

1111
01:07:14,925 --> 01:07:17,685
Speaker 6:  And I I would, I would bet that he sees it that way too. But

1112
01:07:17,685 --> 01:07:21,365
Speaker 5:  Like in the context of this, they also launched Threads, right?

1113
01:07:22,025 --> 01:07:25,845
Speaker 5:  And Threads is was a copy of Twitter. It now is a weird parallel

1114
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:29,805
Speaker 5:  ecosystem of just like, it's still creators doing prompts all

1115
01:07:29,805 --> 01:07:32,885
Speaker 5:  day long. Yeah. But like the prompts are getting darker and weirder. Like,

1116
01:07:32,885 --> 01:07:36,605
Speaker 5:  tell me five people you hate something like what is happening on

1117
01:07:36,605 --> 01:07:39,845
Speaker 5:  Threads? And they adversary just launched

1118
01:07:40,495 --> 01:07:44,245
Speaker 5:  their cap cut clone Edits, like Instagram is getting ready for TikTok to

1119
01:07:44,245 --> 01:07:48,085
Speaker 5:  go away. Yes. And they're doing it by cloning all the rest of tiktoks

1120
01:07:48,285 --> 01:07:52,075
Speaker 5:  features. They're doing it by turning threads into more of a posting

1121
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:55,515
Speaker 5:  platform for like, they're building a creator marketing

1122
01:07:56,715 --> 01:08:00,315
Speaker 5:  platform that still has nothing to do with Facebook as far as I can tell.

1123
01:08:00,865 --> 01:08:04,675
Speaker 5:  Like, all of the interesting things that are happening at Meta are happening

1124
01:08:04,695 --> 01:08:07,635
Speaker 5:  and the threads Instagram zone,

1125
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,945
Speaker 5:  but nothing is happening on, on It is like, if you care about it the most,

1126
01:08:11,945 --> 01:08:13,585
Speaker 5:  like why don't you have any ideas for it?

1127
01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:17,005
Speaker 6:  Well, there's that, I mean, I think, I think to some extent that's

1128
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:22,605
Speaker 6:  a view that is easy to hold for people of a certain age in the United States,

1129
01:08:22,605 --> 01:08:26,165
Speaker 6:  right? Which are like Facebook's least engaged demographic right now.

1130
01:08:27,025 --> 01:08:29,445
Speaker 6:  But It is true that you go lots of pla other places around the world and

1131
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:32,885
Speaker 6:  Facebook is much more like central to culture and it's very important. But

1132
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:36,725
Speaker 6:  also to your previous point, Facebook is now so big

1133
01:08:37,475 --> 01:08:41,405
Speaker 6:  that I think you can't mess with it. And, and like we, we've even

1134
01:08:41,435 --> 01:08:45,365
Speaker 6:  seen in the trial last week, Zuckerberg had used to have all these wild ideas.

1135
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:49,485
Speaker 6:  What if we reset everybody's friend count every year and made them

1136
01:08:49,485 --> 01:08:52,805
Speaker 6:  rebuild it from scratch? Which the more I think about It is an idea that

1137
01:08:52,885 --> 01:08:56,525
Speaker 6:  I love. And I think all of social media should maybe adopt this like on January 1st,

1138
01:08:56,525 --> 01:08:59,725
Speaker 6:  every year you just start from a clean slate and have to do it again. Amazing.

1139
01:08:59,725 --> 01:09:02,725
Speaker 6:  Should do that. But like

1140
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:07,485
Speaker 6:  increasingly It is like, it's both sort of too big to fail and also too

1141
01:09:07,545 --> 01:09:11,325
Speaker 6:  big to do anything with. So it's just kind of left over here.

1142
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah. By itself. Kevin

1143
01:09:13,175 --> 01:09:16,685
Speaker 5:  Citro showing up in saying I could have done this. No problem. I think is

1144
01:09:17,185 --> 01:09:19,885
Speaker 5:  to your point, devastating to, to meta in this case.

1145
01:09:20,715 --> 01:09:21,215
Speaker 6:  Yes. Because

1146
01:09:21,405 --> 01:09:24,095
Speaker 5:  He's, he, he's very confident that he could have succeeded here.

1147
01:09:24,115 --> 01:09:26,775
Speaker 7:  But David, you were saying that like market definition is not going to be

1148
01:09:26,775 --> 01:09:30,735
Speaker 7:  important. But it sounds like you're saying that actually what matters

1149
01:09:31,155 --> 01:09:35,015
Speaker 7:  in the end is people just don't like Facebook. Right? And, and like, is that

1150
01:09:35,015 --> 01:09:38,815
Speaker 7:  enough to get a judge to agree that It is a monopoly? Like I still just

1151
01:09:38,815 --> 01:09:42,735
Speaker 7:  fundamentally, right? Instagram could have been great on its own. Sure,

1152
01:09:42,765 --> 01:09:46,535
Speaker 7:  sure, that's fine. But that doesn't make meta a monopoly

1153
01:09:46,535 --> 01:09:47,935
Speaker 7:  today, does it? But

1154
01:09:48,015 --> 01:09:51,575
Speaker 5:  It's not today. It's not today. This is actually a, as I've done more

1155
01:09:51,575 --> 01:09:54,735
Speaker 5:  reporting on this and talked to more people, the

1156
01:09:55,355 --> 01:09:59,255
Speaker 5:  the thing that the government is, is trying to argue as clearly as it can

1157
01:09:59,915 --> 01:10:03,855
Speaker 5:  is the bad thing that happened is Mark Zuckerberg's saw upstart competitors

1158
01:10:03,955 --> 01:10:07,825
Speaker 5:  and tried to kill them. And here now are the founders of

1159
01:10:07,825 --> 01:10:11,585
Speaker 5:  those competitors showing up and saying, we got bought, they

1160
01:10:11,585 --> 01:10:15,425
Speaker 5:  paid the money. And this argument that they supercharged

1161
01:10:15,425 --> 01:10:19,145
Speaker 5:  our growth is just fiction, right? Because actually what there was was

1162
01:10:19,385 --> 01:10:23,225
Speaker 5:  jealousy and a reduction in resources. And we could would've raised money

1163
01:10:23,245 --> 01:10:26,945
Speaker 5:  or grown on our own or been more innovative. But instead I fought these political

1164
01:10:26,945 --> 01:10:27,225
Speaker 5:  battles,

1165
01:10:27,275 --> 01:10:31,265
Speaker 6:  Which is a tricky argument because like scoreboard, right? Yeah. Like look

1166
01:10:31,265 --> 01:10:35,025
Speaker 6:  at Instagram, you, you can't argue that Instagram has not been a huge success.

1167
01:10:35,025 --> 01:10:38,985
Speaker 6:  That's just, that doesn't work. But, but Citro got up there and

1168
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:42,505
Speaker 6:  was basically like we succeeded against the wishes of our

1169
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:46,265
Speaker 6:  acquirer. Which I think to your point Eli, is if that

1170
01:10:46,545 --> 01:10:49,225
Speaker 6:  argument is successful, that's the argument that wins this case. Yeah.

1171
01:10:49,525 --> 01:10:52,665
Speaker 5:  So by the way, meta, you know, Andy Stone from Meta is out there being like,

1172
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,225
Speaker 5:  look at all this nice stuff Kevin SRAM has said in the public in the past.

1173
01:10:55,525 --> 01:10:59,005
Speaker 5:  And it's like, well dude, he wasn't on in court under oath.

1174
01:10:59,715 --> 01:11:03,665
Speaker 5:  Like totally free to say whatever he wants. Like he worked for you. Yeah,

1175
01:11:03,685 --> 01:11:05,625
Speaker 5:  of course. He said nice things when he worked for you.

1176
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,745
Speaker 6:  He's also got his fuck you money now in like a very real way.

1177
01:11:09,145 --> 01:11:11,825
Speaker 5:  I mean, that's the dream, right? Yeah. Is to sell the company for a billion

1178
01:11:11,825 --> 01:11:15,085
Speaker 5:  dollars and then like years later show up and be like, you were a dick.

1179
01:11:17,755 --> 01:11:18,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1180
01:11:18,465 --> 01:11:22,045
Speaker 5:  That's again, that one's very clean. I can see it, I can see how Instagram

1181
01:11:22,045 --> 01:11:25,645
Speaker 5:  survives as a business all on its own. I can't quite see how WhatsApp

1182
01:11:25,645 --> 01:11:28,085
Speaker 5:  survives as a business all its own. But the most interesting thing about

1183
01:11:28,355 --> 01:11:32,285
Speaker 5:  that conversation is the founders of WhatsApp had no

1184
01:11:32,285 --> 01:11:36,255
Speaker 5:  intention of being a big business. And Zuckerberg was like shocked

1185
01:11:36,315 --> 01:11:38,335
Speaker 5:  by, I think he said they they lacked ambition.

1186
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:43,015
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They just were happy doing their thing and they, they were like a small

1187
01:11:43,015 --> 01:11:46,895
Speaker 6:  team that was massively successful. They probably would

1188
01:11:46,895 --> 01:11:50,815
Speaker 6:  never have been a, whatever it was, $21 billion business that they ended

1189
01:11:50,815 --> 01:11:51,655
Speaker 6:  up selling for.

1190
01:11:53,165 --> 01:11:56,785
Speaker 6:  But yeah, they were fine with that. And, and in a really funny way that

1191
01:11:57,515 --> 01:12:01,325
Speaker 6:  gave them tons of leverage. Yeah. It also turns out that

1192
01:12:01,795 --> 01:12:05,405
Speaker 6:  this is the other thing that came up in, in court was that absolutely everyone

1193
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:09,005
Speaker 6:  wanted to buy WhatsApp. Like we, we kind of knew that at the time,

1194
01:12:09,705 --> 01:12:13,685
Speaker 6:  but Google kicked the tires. I think Twitter at the time kicked

1195
01:12:13,685 --> 01:12:17,205
Speaker 6:  the tires. Like it was, it was very clear that this was going to be

1196
01:12:17,925 --> 01:12:21,445
Speaker 6:  a thing. And it, it gave, it gave

1197
01:12:22,645 --> 01:12:26,365
Speaker 6:  WhatsApp a lot of leverage and credibility, but it also put meta in a position

1198
01:12:26,365 --> 01:12:29,485
Speaker 6:  of being like, oh, this thing is a huge threat to us as being validated.

1199
01:12:29,485 --> 01:12:31,205
Speaker 6:  We have to go get it right now. Wow.

1200
01:12:32,695 --> 01:12:36,055
Speaker 5:  I dunno what's gonna happen in this one. I i, the, the, the, the, the twists

1201
01:12:36,055 --> 01:12:39,455
Speaker 5:  and turns day by day in this trial. You know, there's this a very old

1202
01:12:39,675 --> 01:12:42,975
Speaker 5:  cliche in like lawyer world, that if you don't have the law on your side,

1203
01:12:42,975 --> 01:12:44,975
Speaker 5:  you argue the facts and you don't have the facts, you argue the law. If you

1204
01:12:44,975 --> 01:12:47,735
Speaker 5:  don't have either, you pound the table. This is like a joke that, oh, that's

1205
01:12:47,735 --> 01:12:51,295
Speaker 5:  good all and it feels like meta doesn't have the facts. So they're really

1206
01:12:51,295 --> 01:12:55,175
Speaker 5:  focused on these very hyper-technical legal arguments. And

1207
01:12:55,175 --> 01:12:58,615
Speaker 5:  then it's also just like the Trump FTC is in charge of this trial and I Mark

1208
01:12:58,615 --> 01:13:01,695
Speaker 5:  Zuckerberg's in the Oval Office, like throwing money around, like no idea

1209
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:05,465
Speaker 5:  what's gonna happen here. But it does seem like my prediction

1210
01:13:05,585 --> 01:13:09,465
Speaker 5:  with Google is 36 months, totally different company one way or

1211
01:13:09,465 --> 01:13:12,865
Speaker 5:  another, 36 months from now, 36 months from now. What do you think meta looks

1212
01:13:12,865 --> 01:13:12,985
Speaker 5:  like?

1213
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,985
Speaker 6:  Jake, what do you think?

1214
01:13:14,825 --> 01:13:17,385
Speaker 7:  I I think they're gonna walk out of this. I think they're gonna be fine.

1215
01:13:18,215 --> 01:13:21,595
Speaker 7:  It it, it's, it's a confusing technical trial and

1216
01:13:22,995 --> 01:13:25,595
Speaker 7:  I, I don't know how much the Trump White House has committed to this thing.

1217
01:13:26,315 --> 01:13:30,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I keep saying it's the most legible one. It's very hard to explain

1218
01:13:30,045 --> 01:13:30,805
Speaker 5:  Google Ad Tech to people.

1219
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:34,605
Speaker 7:  But I I that it's so funny 'cause I I still feel like this trial

1220
01:13:34,745 --> 01:13:38,165
Speaker 7:  is, we don't like meta Yeah. We don't like Mark Zuckerberg.

1221
01:13:38,475 --> 01:13:42,325
Speaker 7:  That is is valid. Very legible. That is very, very, very, very real.

1222
01:13:44,105 --> 01:13:47,445
Speaker 7:  But it, I, I don't know, is is it against the law? Like,

1223
01:13:48,305 --> 01:13:50,365
Speaker 5:  Ugh, you're so unlikeable. It's illegal.

1224
01:13:51,585 --> 01:13:52,165
Speaker 7:  That's tough

1225
01:13:53,135 --> 01:13:56,685
Speaker 5:  Right now in the American legal system, like edging closer to a viable,

1226
01:13:56,875 --> 01:14:00,685
Speaker 5:  it's close. We'll see, we'll see. David, what's your prediction?

1227
01:14:01,815 --> 01:14:05,335
Speaker 6:  IIII think what meta should do

1228
01:14:05,715 --> 01:14:09,015
Speaker 6:  and genuinely might, is just spin off Instagram of its own volition.

1229
01:14:09,775 --> 01:14:12,805
Speaker 6:  I think that solves this problem. You can't spin out WhatsApp in the same

1230
01:14:12,805 --> 01:14:16,685
Speaker 6:  way, but I think it, it, it agrees to a

1231
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:20,445
Speaker 6:  settlement where it spins off Instagram and actually wins

1232
01:14:20,875 --> 01:14:24,085
Speaker 6:  just as much because Instagram would be fabulously successful on its own.

1233
01:14:24,265 --> 01:14:24,485
Speaker 6:  Do

1234
01:14:24,485 --> 01:14:26,925
Speaker 5:  You think there's like a move in inside Meta that's like, let Messer Cook?

1235
01:14:27,915 --> 01:14:31,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I kind of, I mean, Moser's been cooking, right? Like it's,

1236
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:35,645
Speaker 6:  it's not nothing that he has been out in front of this company for a

1237
01:14:35,645 --> 01:14:38,925
Speaker 6:  pretty long time now and keep pioneered the chain. Yeah, exactly.

1238
01:14:39,545 --> 01:14:41,205
Speaker 6:  So another thing that Mark Fast followed,

1239
01:14:43,565 --> 01:14:46,445
Speaker 5:  I mean, I I've been saying this for months on this show, that these companies

1240
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:49,285
Speaker 5:  should break themselves up before the government does it for them. And I,

1241
01:14:49,325 --> 01:14:52,885
Speaker 5:  I could buy that, but I I I, they're too proud of a company to, to do that.

1242
01:14:53,145 --> 01:14:55,565
Speaker 6:  Can I just say real quick, I just wanna shout out to people before we get

1243
01:14:55,565 --> 01:14:58,765
Speaker 6:  off this topic. One is Lauren Finer, who has been in court,

1244
01:14:59,435 --> 01:15:03,205
Speaker 6:  it's multiple courtrooms at a time all week and has been doing awesome work

1245
01:15:03,205 --> 01:15:06,445
Speaker 6:  for us all over the website. The other person is Dirk Stoop,

1246
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:11,205
Speaker 6:  who was a former product manager on the Facebook camera team

1247
01:15:11,745 --> 01:15:15,605
Speaker 6:  who was called up to testify in this trial and was basically asked

1248
01:15:16,005 --> 01:15:19,165
Speaker 6:  a series of questions that amounted to why was Facebook camera so bad that

1249
01:15:19,165 --> 01:15:23,005
Speaker 6:  they had to buy Instagram. And that's tough. And I that's, I just wanna

1250
01:15:23,005 --> 01:15:26,885
Speaker 6:  say to Dirk that you you did, you did your best and I'm very sorry you

1251
01:15:26,885 --> 01:15:27,445
Speaker 6:  did those three

1252
01:15:27,445 --> 01:15:30,085
Speaker 5:  Best socks. Big shout out to Lauren, by the way. We would've had her on the

1253
01:15:30,085 --> 01:15:31,805
Speaker 5:  show, but she's in court right now. Yeah,

1254
01:15:32,355 --> 01:15:36,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Literally the next time Lauren comes out of the DC Circuit Courthouse,

1255
01:15:36,545 --> 01:15:37,565
Speaker 6:  we will have her on this show.

1256
01:15:37,565 --> 01:15:40,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah, but she, yeah, she's killing it. All right. We gotta take a break

1257
01:15:41,465 --> 01:15:45,365
Speaker 5:  and rest up for the lighting round. You let us know. You tell me

1258
01:15:45,365 --> 01:15:48,285
Speaker 5:  what you think. Email us 36 months around, what do these companies look like?

1259
01:15:48,345 --> 01:15:51,405
Speaker 5:  I'm dying to All right, we gotta take a break. We'll be right back

1260
01:17:10,545 --> 01:17:13,855
Speaker 5:  We are back. It's time for the lightning round. Unsponsored for flavor.

1261
01:17:14,305 --> 01:17:16,855
Speaker 6:  We've gotten some t-shirt designs. I'm pretty excited about them

1262
01:17:17,105 --> 01:17:20,855
Speaker 5:  Today. I I, I had a meeting with a platform executive and

1263
01:17:20,995 --> 01:17:24,175
Speaker 5:  he was asked me some business questions and I was like, I don't know. I talked

1264
01:17:24,175 --> 01:17:27,335
Speaker 5:  to our publisher Allen, she's very smart, and he was like, you don't get

1265
01:17:27,535 --> 01:17:29,575
Speaker 5:  involved in your business. And I was like, no, what I sell is our ethics

1266
01:17:29,575 --> 01:17:33,525
Speaker 5:  policy. He goes, oh, that's very royal. And it was a real interaction I had

1267
01:17:33,525 --> 01:17:37,495
Speaker 5:  and I was like, It is very royal. That's what we sell here, because it,

1268
01:17:37,495 --> 01:17:39,855
Speaker 5:  you know, it's like high and mighty. That's what he meant. Oh,

1269
01:17:40,275 --> 01:17:42,575
Speaker 6:  Not like of the Royals. I was like, no, he

1270
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:45,135
Speaker 5:  Didn't mean that like me and Meghan Markle have anything in common. He meant

1271
01:17:45,135 --> 01:17:48,855
Speaker 5:  that you sound like a pompous jerk. And I was like, I am in fact

1272
01:17:48,855 --> 01:17:52,375
Speaker 5:  very, very precious about the fact that you can't pay me to say anything

1273
01:17:52,955 --> 01:17:55,895
Speaker 5:  unless you new sponsor the lightning round. In which case, let's talk.

1274
01:17:56,725 --> 01:18:00,375
Speaker 6:  It's time for our new segment in the lightning round. Neli versus Meghan

1275
01:18:00,395 --> 01:18:00,815
Speaker 6:  Markle,

1276
01:18:02,395 --> 01:18:03,335
Speaker 6:  who wore best.

1277
01:18:03,605 --> 01:18:06,175
Speaker 5:  It's time to get some clicks on YouTube, my friends.

1278
01:18:07,385 --> 01:18:10,855
Speaker 5:  Let's do it. We're going straight into celebrity coverage. All the latest

1279
01:18:11,035 --> 01:18:13,895
Speaker 5:  in Celebrity Defamation. I don't know anything about that.

1280
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:17,455
Speaker 6:  She does have a podcast. I think so. Technically she is our enemy now. So

1281
01:18:18,515 --> 01:18:21,135
Speaker 5:  Did she win the Webby for Best Technology podcast? I'm saying she did not.

1282
01:18:21,365 --> 01:18:24,095
Speaker 5:  Duchess. Yeah. All right. I don't

1283
01:18:25,005 --> 01:18:25,295
Speaker 6:  Sign

1284
01:18:25,415 --> 01:18:28,735
Speaker 7:  US BBC takes. Were just, they're outta left field did not make any sense.

1285
01:18:28,895 --> 01:18:30,215
Speaker 7:  I know the, the people weren't buying it,

1286
01:18:30,435 --> 01:18:33,095
Speaker 5:  But wait, but I think the audience knows. I think Suits is a horrible show.

1287
01:18:33,155 --> 01:18:35,055
Speaker 5:  All right, we have to stop talking about Meghan

1288
01:18:35,115 --> 01:18:35,535
Speaker 6:  Markle.

1289
01:18:37,355 --> 01:18:40,845
Speaker 5:  Ooh. All right, David. Is it time?

1290
01:18:41,395 --> 01:18:44,925
Speaker 6:  It's time. It is time once again for

1291
01:18:45,425 --> 01:18:49,005
Speaker 6:  the 2026 Webby winning podcast. Within a podcast.

1292
01:18:50,015 --> 01:18:53,925
Speaker 6:  We're gonna win so hard. We create a category just so we can win it.

1293
01:18:54,435 --> 01:18:56,765
Speaker 6:  Brendan Carr is a dummy. Neli what he got,

1294
01:18:57,275 --> 01:19:01,105
Speaker 5:  Brendan had a, he had a quiet week. He did, he had a quiet week.

1295
01:19:01,285 --> 01:19:05,225
Speaker 5:  He went to a satellite company in Texas with Ted Cruz

1296
01:19:05,685 --> 01:19:09,065
Speaker 5:  and said he was bringing American innovation back in a way that required

1297
01:19:09,065 --> 01:19:12,065
Speaker 5:  him to say Ted Cruz is like cool and smart

1298
01:19:13,285 --> 01:19:16,555
Speaker 5:  again. I think Brendan's a dummy. So he got hoodwinked by Ted Cruz and having

1299
01:19:16,555 --> 01:19:20,355
Speaker 5:  to say, Ted Cruz is cool and smart. So that happened. The really interesting

1300
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:24,275
Speaker 5:  things that happened with Brendan this week. Amount to who he

1301
01:19:24,275 --> 01:19:28,115
Speaker 5:  will talk to and who he will not talk to. Okay. The thesis

1302
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:32,235
Speaker 5:  of the Trump administration this time around is what if corruption

1303
01:19:32,235 --> 01:19:35,995
Speaker 5:  was cool, right? You can see it all over the place. Like what if

1304
01:19:35,995 --> 01:19:39,435
Speaker 5:  Mark Zuckerberg gives Trump a million dollars? Is that enough to settle a

1305
01:19:39,435 --> 01:19:42,755
Speaker 5:  lawsuit? The answer is no. So we're gonna find out if it's $2 million. Like

1306
01:19:42,785 --> 01:19:46,235
Speaker 5:  there's just a lot of what if corruption was cool happening in this

1307
01:19:46,235 --> 01:19:49,995
Speaker 5:  administration? So the first one is just so

1308
01:19:49,995 --> 01:19:53,715
Speaker 5:  funny. Who is, who is Brenda meeting with? Well, he's meeting with his old

1309
01:19:53,715 --> 01:19:57,195
Speaker 5:  boss, a Jeep Pie, who is in the White House and at the FCC this week in his

1310
01:19:57,575 --> 01:20:01,395
Speaker 5:  new role is president of the CTIA, which is the wireless industry's

1311
01:20:01,395 --> 01:20:05,355
Speaker 5:  number one lobbying group. And they're posting selfies together. So

1312
01:20:05,355 --> 01:20:09,005
Speaker 5:  here's the head of the FCC posting selfies with his old boss

1313
01:20:09,225 --> 01:20:12,645
Speaker 5:  who is now the top lobbyist for the wireless companies that Brendan

1314
01:20:12,965 --> 01:20:16,915
Speaker 5:  regulates just openly corrupt. Like, it's just like hilariously corrupt,

1315
01:20:16,915 --> 01:20:20,835
Speaker 5:  right? Like these guys are supposed to

1316
01:20:20,835 --> 01:20:24,315
Speaker 5:  be on opposite sides of the fence and there's always a weirdness, right?

1317
01:20:24,315 --> 01:20:28,075
Speaker 5:  With, with the regulator and the companies they regulate. 'cause the regulator

1318
01:20:28,075 --> 01:20:31,275
Speaker 5:  wants the companies to be successful. We all want the wireless companies

1319
01:20:31,275 --> 01:20:34,075
Speaker 5:  to like have good networks and charge reasonable rates and all this stuff.

1320
01:20:34,535 --> 01:20:38,415
Speaker 5:  And you're like, no, that's a gpi. Like he, he's the one who was

1321
01:20:38,415 --> 01:20:40,535
Speaker 5:  like, you know what we should do? We should create Dish Network. Like, it

1322
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:44,255
Speaker 5:  doesn't make any sense at all. None of this makes any sense. Like what if

1323
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:48,175
Speaker 5:  we went from having lots of competitors to three and then a

1324
01:20:48,175 --> 01:20:50,815
Speaker 5:  fake network that ran something called Open ran that doesn't work

1325
01:20:51,865 --> 01:20:55,295
Speaker 5:  every day. The CEO of Verizon wakes up thinking about Dish Network. Like

1326
01:20:55,295 --> 01:20:58,815
Speaker 5:  it's just a fake, it's a totally fake situation. Yeah. But he's in the office,

1327
01:20:59,215 --> 01:21:02,315
Speaker 5:  a Jeep Pie taking Softies together. You know who he's not meeting with

1328
01:21:04,155 --> 01:21:07,625
Speaker 5:  David Ellison, who wants to buy Paramount and CBS

1329
01:21:08,475 --> 01:21:09,085
Speaker 6:  Reporting

1330
01:21:09,085 --> 01:21:12,925
Speaker 5:  In puck this week. Brendan who has threatened CBS Trump

1331
01:21:12,925 --> 01:21:16,845
Speaker 5:  has threatened CBS over 60 minutes. News distortion, all the censorship he

1332
01:21:16,845 --> 01:21:19,925
Speaker 5:  wants to do, saying I wanna have investigations into CBS and how it works.

1333
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:24,405
Speaker 5:  Well, the potential acquirer of Paramount in C Bs, David

1334
01:21:24,645 --> 01:21:28,165
Speaker 5:  Ellison, whose father is Larry Ellison, notable Trump donor

1335
01:21:29,085 --> 01:21:30,155
Speaker 5:  can't get Brandon on the phone.

1336
01:21:30,995 --> 01:21:34,955
Speaker 6:  Interesting. That's a weird one because I mean, the other news this week

1337
01:21:34,975 --> 01:21:38,955
Speaker 6:  was Bill Owens, the, the, the executive producer

1338
01:21:38,955 --> 01:21:42,915
Speaker 6:  of 60 Minutes quit basically because he was like, I, I

1339
01:21:42,915 --> 01:21:46,675
Speaker 6:  have become a corporate problem. And because of all

1340
01:21:46,695 --> 01:21:50,395
Speaker 6:  the like journalistic shenanigans of the parent company,

1341
01:21:50,895 --> 01:21:54,835
Speaker 6:  he was like, I, I can't, I can't be here anymore. And all of this is being

1342
01:21:54,865 --> 01:21:58,555
Speaker 6:  done in this incredibly crappy, shady, anti

1343
01:21:58,555 --> 01:22:02,355
Speaker 6:  journalistic way so that Brendan Carr will take David Ellison's phone calls.

1344
01:22:02,455 --> 01:22:06,155
Speaker 6:  That's the whole point of all of this, is we are going to write giant

1345
01:22:06,155 --> 01:22:09,355
Speaker 6:  settlement checks so that they let the deal go through. Yep.

1346
01:22:10,045 --> 01:22:12,065
Speaker 6:  And it's just, it's just not happening.

1347
01:22:12,175 --> 01:22:14,985
Speaker 5:  What if corruption worked, right? It's, and the answer is the check isn't

1348
01:22:14,985 --> 01:22:18,865
Speaker 5:  big enough. The capitulation hasn't been big enough. There's a Bill Owens

1349
01:22:18,865 --> 01:22:21,785
Speaker 5:  a 60 minutes producer said, I can't produce a show in an independent way

1350
01:22:21,785 --> 01:22:25,625
Speaker 5:  anymore. I've gotta go. The corporate pressure on the news division is too

1351
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:29,545
Speaker 5:  high and it's still not enough. And so the thesis is, and

1352
01:22:29,545 --> 01:22:31,985
Speaker 5:  this is in the, in the puck article, we'll, we'll put it in the, the show

1353
01:22:31,985 --> 01:22:35,625
Speaker 5:  notes is legally this is all bad.

1354
01:22:36,155 --> 01:22:40,105
Speaker 5:  These are clear violations of the First Amendment for the FCC to, to

1355
01:22:40,525 --> 01:22:44,425
Speaker 5:  say, we'll launch an investigation in 60 minutes for Donald Trump to say,

1356
01:22:44,535 --> 01:22:47,705
Speaker 5:  last week, I think Brendan Carr should pull CBS's broadcast license 'cause

1357
01:22:47,705 --> 01:22:50,345
Speaker 5:  they didn't like the coverage. You take that to court, you're gonna win.

1358
01:22:50,635 --> 01:22:54,465
Speaker 5:  Right? That, that's just violations of the First Amendment straightforwardly.

1359
01:22:54,895 --> 01:22:58,745
Speaker 5:  News distortion does not mean I don't like it. Like there's,

1360
01:22:58,745 --> 01:23:01,825
Speaker 5:  there's a real standard there, there's a jurisprudence. These cases aren't

1361
01:23:01,825 --> 01:23:05,320
Speaker 5:  brought very often because they're incredibly hard for the government to

1362
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:08,365
Speaker 5:  win, for good reason because the First Amendment exists. But they

1363
01:23:08,365 --> 01:23:10,565
Speaker 6:  Have no intention of winning it. They have an in, they have every intention

1364
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:12,805
Speaker 6:  of of getting a check and an apology.

1365
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:16,965
Speaker 5:  What they want is power. So you don't take the call and you make the person

1366
01:23:17,065 --> 01:23:20,925
Speaker 5:  do more and more stuff to bend to your will to get what you

1367
01:23:20,925 --> 01:23:24,485
Speaker 5:  want. And this is the thesis now. He will meet with a jet in his office,

1368
01:23:24,755 --> 01:23:27,925
Speaker 5:  take selfies together to give the wireless companies more spectrum because

1369
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:31,515
Speaker 5:  they spend a lot of money on lobbying, but he won't meet with David

1370
01:23:31,795 --> 01:23:35,595
Speaker 5:  Ellison, whose deal he's blocking on totally specious grounds. So

1371
01:23:35,595 --> 01:23:39,485
Speaker 5:  that CBS will put even more pressure on its new division that is just

1372
01:23:39,485 --> 01:23:43,005
Speaker 5:  censorship stuff. That is just Brendan trying to

1373
01:23:43,135 --> 01:23:46,885
Speaker 5:  shift what is acceptable public debate in his role as a government

1374
01:23:46,885 --> 01:23:50,685
Speaker 5:  regulator speech. As always, this is a disaster for the First

1375
01:23:50,685 --> 01:23:54,645
Speaker 5:  Amendment for American civil liberties. And you can see at some

1376
01:23:54,645 --> 01:23:57,845
Speaker 5:  point the rich people who wanna buy CBS who own the networks should start

1377
01:23:58,005 --> 01:24:00,845
Speaker 5:  fighting back. 'cause when they're fighting back in other parts of the government,

1378
01:24:00,845 --> 01:24:04,445
Speaker 5:  when Harvard fights back against Trump administration, they start to cave.

1379
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:08,485
Speaker 5:  But no one's really pushed back on Brendan yet, at least from the

1380
01:24:08,765 --> 01:24:11,925
Speaker 5:  industry. But the thing that's starting to happen that I think is fascinating

1381
01:24:12,225 --> 01:24:16,205
Speaker 5:  is the other commissioners of the FCC former commissioners of the FCC

1382
01:24:16,425 --> 01:24:20,405
Speaker 5:  are starting to push back very loudly. So Anna Gomez,

1383
01:24:20,505 --> 01:24:24,365
Speaker 5:  who is a democratic commissioner of the SEC, is going on tour. She's

1384
01:24:24,445 --> 01:24:27,725
Speaker 5:  actually, I think she's starting today as we record, she's going on tour

1385
01:24:27,785 --> 01:24:28,845
Speaker 5:  to protect the First Amendment.

1386
01:24:30,515 --> 01:24:32,045
Speaker 5:  It's called the First Amendment Tour to

1387
01:24:32,045 --> 01:24:34,725
Speaker 6:  Challenge. What a cool thing to say, by the way, I'm going on tour to protect

1388
01:24:34,725 --> 01:24:35,365
Speaker 6:  the First Amendment.

1389
01:24:35,585 --> 01:24:39,005
Speaker 5:  The tour is called the First Amendment tour to challenge government censorship

1390
01:24:39,005 --> 01:24:41,885
Speaker 5:  and control. So she announced today she's having events all over the country.

1391
01:24:42,865 --> 01:24:46,765
Speaker 5:  She says the FCC is being weaponized under Brendan Carr to

1392
01:24:46,765 --> 01:24:50,005
Speaker 5:  attack freedom of speech in the media and telecommunication sector instead

1393
01:24:50,005 --> 01:24:53,205
Speaker 5:  of focusing on its core mission, connecting the public, protecting consumers

1394
01:24:53,205 --> 01:24:55,085
Speaker 5:  and supporting competition. I

1395
01:24:55,085 --> 01:24:58,645
Speaker 6:  Feel like we can't say clearly enough that that is from another FCC

1396
01:24:58,645 --> 01:24:59,205
Speaker 6:  commissioner

1397
01:24:59,515 --> 01:25:02,525
Speaker 5:  From another FCC commissioner, his colleague,

1398
01:25:03,925 --> 01:25:07,835
Speaker 5:  weird. They go to the same office, they, they park their cars next to each

1399
01:25:07,835 --> 01:25:10,755
Speaker 5:  other and she's like, Hey, you're a weird threat to America. I mean, they

1400
01:25:11,075 --> 01:25:12,155
Speaker 6:  Actively work together closely.

1401
01:25:12,915 --> 01:25:14,595
Speaker 5:  I it's unclear under

1402
01:25:14,595 --> 01:25:15,635
Speaker 6:  Normal circumstances,

1403
01:25:15,785 --> 01:25:19,595
Speaker 5:  It's unclear. Look, the FCC, I've covered the FCC for a long time until Brendan

1404
01:25:19,735 --> 01:25:23,155
Speaker 5:  got there. This was never a bunch of fire breathers,

1405
01:25:24,115 --> 01:25:27,355
Speaker 5:  a bunch of gray suit government lawyers being like, we need to allocate the

1406
01:25:27,435 --> 01:25:30,995
Speaker 5:  spectrum efficient. Like that's, and now they're like a censorship machine.

1407
01:25:31,575 --> 01:25:34,635
Speaker 5:  And you can see it took a while

1408
01:25:35,535 --> 01:25:39,275
Speaker 5:  for everyone else to be like, oh, this is really bad. They had to shake off

1409
01:25:39,815 --> 01:25:43,635
Speaker 5:  the character they were supposed to play and adopt these new characters.

1410
01:25:44,945 --> 01:25:48,475
Speaker 5:  Anna Gomez. Silencing, dissenting voices is not a show of strength. It's

1411
01:25:48,475 --> 01:25:51,915
Speaker 5:  a sign of fear. We must continue to speak out against the growing campaign

1412
01:25:51,915 --> 01:25:55,475
Speaker 5:  of censorship and control before this dangerous new normal becomes the status

1413
01:25:55,535 --> 01:25:59,355
Speaker 5:  quo. That's her talking about nominally her boss. Yeah. Weird.

1414
01:25:59,825 --> 01:26:00,115
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

1415
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:03,405
Speaker 6:  But good. This is like, if you ever discovered the podcast I have where I

1416
01:26:03,405 --> 01:26:07,325
Speaker 6:  just say mean things about you the whole time that's like that,

1417
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:09,085
Speaker 5:  Then I think you will see some signs of fear data.

1418
01:26:11,735 --> 01:26:15,525
Speaker 5:  Crazy, right? Like this is happening in the government right now,

1419
01:26:15,755 --> 01:26:19,405
Speaker 5:  sitting commissioners of the FCC who might be illegally fired by Trump. He's

1420
01:26:19,405 --> 01:26:22,805
Speaker 5:  already illegal fired, legally fired commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission.

1421
01:26:23,155 --> 01:26:27,085
Speaker 5:  He's threatened to illegally fire Powell at the, at the Fed. She's speaking

1422
01:26:27,105 --> 01:26:31,005
Speaker 5:  out. Good for her. She's welcome. If you wanna on tour, you wanna stop with

1423
01:26:31,005 --> 01:26:34,765
Speaker 5:  us and the coder, we'd love to have you commissioner, former commissioner

1424
01:26:34,905 --> 01:26:38,645
Speaker 5:  Tom Wheeler is out with peace and law this week saying

1425
01:26:38,645 --> 01:26:42,565
Speaker 5:  Brendan Carr is moving to break foundational principles of

1426
01:26:42,885 --> 01:26:46,805
Speaker 5:  American government and democracy. I've met Tom Wheeler. Tom

1427
01:26:46,805 --> 01:26:50,645
Speaker 5:  Wheeler has been on VERGE shows before. Go back and just look at a

1428
01:26:50,645 --> 01:26:54,565
Speaker 5:  picture of Tom Wheeler, like, look at him, watch his

1429
01:26:54,565 --> 01:26:58,045
Speaker 5:  interactions with me as I push him on things. He is not a,

1430
01:26:58,345 --> 01:27:01,525
Speaker 5:  you're gonna break foundational principles of American government and democracy.

1431
01:27:02,395 --> 01:27:06,245
Speaker 5:  Editorial writer. He is not a bomb thrower. He is, he was a government

1432
01:27:06,245 --> 01:27:10,155
Speaker 5:  regulator of spectrum. He famously, he came from the industry. People

1433
01:27:10,155 --> 01:27:14,115
Speaker 5:  criticized Obama for revolving door hiring wheels. And

1434
01:27:14,115 --> 01:27:17,555
Speaker 5:  here he is saying, cars actions marking unprecedented

1435
01:27:17,715 --> 01:27:21,195
Speaker 5:  expansion of government intrusion in his free speech and a direct assault

1436
01:27:21,215 --> 01:27:25,155
Speaker 5:  on those engaged in promoting equal opportunity. They undermine the constitutional

1437
01:27:25,155 --> 01:27:28,835
Speaker 5:  balance of power by bypassing co-equal branches of government to enlarge

1438
01:27:28,835 --> 01:27:32,155
Speaker 5:  presidential authority through self-serving presidential decree

1439
01:27:32,895 --> 01:27:36,835
Speaker 6:  For a high level bureaucrat that is like screaming swears as

1440
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:38,435
Speaker 6:  loudly as you possibly can. Yeah,

1441
01:27:38,435 --> 01:27:41,035
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Again, I've known, I've known Wheeler for a long time. Just listen

1442
01:27:41,035 --> 01:27:42,635
Speaker 5:  to him, talk to me about anything in the past,

1443
01:27:44,705 --> 01:27:48,475
Speaker 5:  gaze upon him perceived on Wheeler. And he is like, yeah, you're doing some

1444
01:27:48,635 --> 01:27:52,255
Speaker 5:  dictator stuff, man. It's not normal. So there's some

1445
01:27:52,455 --> 01:27:56,335
Speaker 5:  pushback against Carr this week. He, again, he was in Texas having to pretend

1446
01:27:56,335 --> 01:28:00,225
Speaker 5:  that Ted Cruz is hip and cool. But I'm, I'm,

1447
01:28:00,325 --> 01:28:04,265
Speaker 5:  I'm happy to see Commissioner Gomez and now former Chairman Wheeler

1448
01:28:04,925 --> 01:28:08,545
Speaker 5:  really push back very loudly. And you can see it, it's, it's starting

1449
01:28:08,965 --> 01:28:11,705
Speaker 5:  to percolate throughout the media ecosystem again. There's a big puck article.

1450
01:28:12,485 --> 01:28:16,465
Speaker 5:  So yeah, the podcast within a podcast continues, but the, the

1451
01:28:16,465 --> 01:28:19,585
Speaker 5:  battle is joined. As always, Brendan,

1452
01:28:20,325 --> 01:28:24,265
Speaker 5:  you're welcome to to join us here on America's favorite podcast. Within a

1453
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:28,215
Speaker 5:  podcast. If you have, if you are as cool as you think you are, you will join

1454
01:28:28,295 --> 01:28:32,135
Speaker 5:  a podcast called Brendan Carr is a dummy, right? If, if you have

1455
01:28:32,135 --> 01:28:34,855
Speaker 5:  it, you have the juice, you would be on the show.

1456
01:28:35,745 --> 01:28:39,385
Speaker 5:  You're also welcome on decoder, during which I'm much more polite.

1457
01:28:39,885 --> 01:28:41,665
Speaker 6:  Mm. That seems less fun.

1458
01:28:42,305 --> 01:28:45,305
Speaker 5:  I mean, look, dude, the CEO of Verizon Wireless was just on decoder. He did

1459
01:28:45,305 --> 01:28:48,745
Speaker 5:  not have to come on that show, but he's a fan had the best answer to the

1460
01:28:49,345 --> 01:28:52,865
Speaker 5:  decision making question I've ever heard one of the worst answers to Why

1461
01:28:52,985 --> 01:28:56,265
Speaker 5:  did you kill that neutrality you've ever heard? But that's life. So look,

1462
01:28:56,265 --> 01:28:57,225
Speaker 5:  it's equal opportunity.

1463
01:28:57,575 --> 01:29:00,625
Speaker 6:  It's a really great process for making really bad decisions. I love that.

1464
01:29:01,265 --> 01:29:04,005
Speaker 5:  It was good. It's a good episode. I highly recommend it. We got into it.

1465
01:29:04,235 --> 01:29:08,005
Speaker 5:  He's a listener. He is a virgin nerd. It was cool to talk to him. We

1466
01:29:08,205 --> 01:29:11,965
Speaker 5:  disagree about That's fine Brendan. You're welcome. It will maybe

1467
01:29:11,985 --> 01:29:15,885
Speaker 5:  be less cool. Oh, also, by the way, in that podcast article, Brendan's wife

1468
01:29:16,515 --> 01:29:19,685
Speaker 5:  McKayla, she is the top policy person at Palantir.

1469
01:29:20,725 --> 01:29:24,465
Speaker 5:  The, the MAGA universe. The MAGA extended universe

1470
01:29:24,705 --> 01:29:25,545
Speaker 5:  continues to grow. There

1471
01:29:25,545 --> 01:29:29,425
Speaker 6:  Are only like four companies in, in this entire world. It,

1472
01:29:29,425 --> 01:29:30,025
Speaker 6:  it turns out

1473
01:29:30,205 --> 01:29:32,705
Speaker 5:  All right, Brandon, you're welcome again. I, I think you're a coward, so

1474
01:29:32,705 --> 01:29:35,625
Speaker 5:  you won't show up and dummy. And so if you do, I think you'll lose. But you

1475
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:37,225
Speaker 5:  should come on. It'll be fun. We'll have a good time. Bring

1476
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:38,425
Speaker 6:  Ted Cruz. We'll have a great time.

1477
01:29:39,335 --> 01:29:42,425
Speaker 5:  I've been dying to debate Ted cr Ted Cruz. I, this is like one of those things

1478
01:29:42,425 --> 01:29:45,465
Speaker 5:  like what, what, what would you throw it all away for? And it's like yelling

1479
01:29:45,465 --> 01:29:48,105
Speaker 5:  at Ted Cruz. All right. We need a palate cleanser. David,

1480
01:29:48,445 --> 01:29:52,265
Speaker 6:  Can I just you in a wood smartphone? Is that, is that a good palate

1481
01:29:52,265 --> 01:29:52,545
Speaker 6:  cleanser

1482
01:29:55,335 --> 01:29:58,985
Speaker 6:  Jeep, I think is bringing back the wood. Jeeps wood is back, man. This is,

1483
01:29:58,995 --> 01:30:00,305
Speaker 6:  we're we're doing it here. Yeah. Because

1484
01:30:00,325 --> 01:30:01,905
Speaker 5:  We can't import anything else, right?

1485
01:30:02,495 --> 01:30:03,185
Speaker 6:  It's gonna cut down

1486
01:30:03,185 --> 01:30:04,745
Speaker 5:  More trees have to cut down America forests.

1487
01:30:04,935 --> 01:30:05,305
Speaker 6:  It's great.

1488
01:30:07,185 --> 01:30:11,065
Speaker 6:  Motorola came out with some new phones. I am torn on these.

1489
01:30:11,085 --> 01:30:14,865
Speaker 6:  So it's, it's three different flip phones like the, the

1490
01:30:14,865 --> 01:30:18,145
Speaker 6:  thing Motorola has been doing at the Razor. But the most interesting one

1491
01:30:18,145 --> 01:30:22,065
Speaker 6:  is the Razor Ultra, which I, I would say essentially

1492
01:30:22,065 --> 01:30:26,025
Speaker 6:  makes the same set of changes that the other new razors do, which is like,

1493
01:30:26,025 --> 01:30:29,185
Speaker 6:  you know, it's a little, a little faster. It has slightly better,

1494
01:30:30,095 --> 01:30:33,945
Speaker 6:  like build quality essentially. Like that's the thing Motorola sort of consistently

1495
01:30:33,945 --> 01:30:36,145
Speaker 6:  is trying to get better at. It's just like how to make these things nice.

1496
01:30:36,805 --> 01:30:40,705
Speaker 6:  But the ultra has a wood back. It's $1,300.

1497
01:30:41,325 --> 01:30:44,825
Speaker 6:  It is preposterous and I love it so much.

1498
01:30:45,175 --> 01:30:48,225
Speaker 5:  There's a really fun thing to do whenever this comes up, which is look at

1499
01:30:48,225 --> 01:30:51,825
Speaker 5:  our own links of our own coverage about Motorola making wooden

1500
01:30:51,825 --> 01:30:55,145
Speaker 5:  phones. And I'm just pointing out that in 2014,

1501
01:30:55,215 --> 01:30:58,905
Speaker 5:  January 29th, 2014, David Pierce wrote a story about the

1502
01:30:58,935 --> 01:31:02,745
Speaker 5:  Moto X called the New Retro, how Motorola brought wood back.

1503
01:31:02,815 --> 01:31:06,705
Speaker 5:  Literally. And it's about the wooden back of the Moto X and the first line,

1504
01:31:06,725 --> 01:31:10,105
Speaker 5:  the lead. That's terrible. I don't know how you and I chose this 'cause I

1505
01:31:10,265 --> 01:31:13,465
Speaker 5:  remember editing this story, but the lead of this story,

1506
01:31:15,255 --> 01:31:19,035
Speaker 5:  the first sentence not so long ago, wood was everywhere

1507
01:31:19,135 --> 01:31:21,155
Speaker 5:  in the world of consumer electronics

1508
01:31:21,575 --> 01:31:25,445
Speaker 6:  Was this is fact. And by not so long

1509
01:31:25,445 --> 01:31:27,165
Speaker 6:  ago, I mean the mid 1970s,

1510
01:31:28,995 --> 01:31:32,885
Speaker 5:  It's like, okay, look on website, it's like a time capsule into like,

1511
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:34,165
Speaker 5:  what were we thinking?

1512
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:37,485
Speaker 6:  Jake, what do you think about this phone? Be with me on this, Jake. Well,

1513
01:31:37,485 --> 01:31:39,285
Speaker 6:  there's a, there's a, a key

1514
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:40,405
Speaker 7:  Feature that you failed to mention

1515
01:31:40,905 --> 01:31:44,725
Speaker 5:  By the way. The, the Motorola executive editor in 2014 was Rick Oslo, who

1516
01:31:44,725 --> 01:31:45,085
Speaker 5:  now on,

1517
01:31:46,665 --> 01:31:48,965
Speaker 6:  So I was writing, so was he Fontan? Yeah.

1518
01:31:50,225 --> 01:31:53,525
Speaker 7:  Key feature you forgot to mention. Exclusive to the ultra

1519
01:31:54,225 --> 01:31:57,325
Speaker 7:  big upgrade possibility here. AI button on the side.

1520
01:31:58,425 --> 01:31:58,645
Speaker 6:  Oh.

1521
01:32:00,945 --> 01:32:01,485
Speaker 7:  So what,

1522
01:32:01,485 --> 01:32:03,845
Speaker 6:  What kind of button are we talking about? I missed this. I need to look at

1523
01:32:03,845 --> 01:32:04,445
Speaker 6:  pictures of this now.

1524
01:32:05,185 --> 01:32:09,005
Speaker 7:  It is like your standard flavor button. It's, it, it

1525
01:32:09,005 --> 01:32:12,725
Speaker 7:  opens up some AI menu where you can maybe

1526
01:32:12,865 --> 01:32:16,645
Speaker 7:  th there's, there's been a lot of noise this week about how perplexity is

1527
01:32:16,645 --> 01:32:18,325
Speaker 7:  gonna come pre-installed on this thing.

1528
01:32:19,845 --> 01:32:22,845
Speaker 7:  I think perplexity was, was probably hoping everyone would,

1529
01:32:24,145 --> 01:32:28,085
Speaker 7:  you know, thi think this is a, a more serious integration.

1530
01:32:28,865 --> 01:32:29,165
Speaker 7:  Not just

1531
01:32:29,225 --> 01:32:29,845
Speaker 6:  The care is the world

1532
01:32:30,265 --> 01:32:33,005
Speaker 7:  Is on the second screen when you open it up.

1533
01:32:34,705 --> 01:32:37,605
Speaker 7:  You know, much potential there. I would say in another world where Gemini

1534
01:32:37,605 --> 01:32:38,085
Speaker 7:  didn't exist.

1535
01:32:39,785 --> 01:32:43,165
Speaker 7:  But listen, I'm all for it. I love it. They also have an

1536
01:32:43,725 --> 01:32:47,245
Speaker 7:  alcantara, I dunno if I'm saying that right version. Yeah. So really it's

1537
01:32:47,245 --> 01:32:50,205
Speaker 7:  hot, greatest hits Surface line. Gave that up.

1538
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:54,965
Speaker 7:  You know, we're due for some fun phone textures. I feel like the razor line

1539
01:32:54,965 --> 01:32:58,925
Speaker 7:  in its way is sort of all about throwback stuff. This is

1540
01:32:58,925 --> 01:33:02,845
Speaker 7:  fun. It's cool. I love it. It's unfortunate that It is exclusive to

1541
01:33:02,845 --> 01:33:06,645
Speaker 7:  the ultra version, which is the most expensive version. And I think you're

1542
01:33:06,645 --> 01:33:09,765
Speaker 7:  stuck with, you know, the plain old options on the like

1543
01:33:10,485 --> 01:33:14,005
Speaker 7:  standard model that I think most people probably go for. But,

1544
01:33:14,745 --> 01:33:15,125
Speaker 7:  but even

1545
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:18,165
Speaker 6:  The standard ones, I will say have, they're, they're doing a fun sort of

1546
01:33:18,165 --> 01:33:21,445
Speaker 6:  two-tone color thing where the bottom half is one color. Mm. And the top

1547
01:33:21,445 --> 01:33:24,965
Speaker 6:  half is another color. It's just nice, right? Like we're in, we're in this

1548
01:33:24,965 --> 01:33:28,885
Speaker 6:  moment where like the best you can hope for is like a gentle blue on your

1549
01:33:28,885 --> 01:33:32,805
Speaker 6:  smartphone. Mm. I bought my phone just to get the blue and

1550
01:33:32,965 --> 01:33:35,765
Speaker 6:  that's, this is what excitement looks like in smartphones now. And

1551
01:33:37,115 --> 01:33:40,005
Speaker 6:  like genuinely kudos to Motorola for a

1552
01:33:41,035 --> 01:33:44,265
Speaker 6:  continuing to go with the only thing it ever did that anyone cares about,

1553
01:33:44,265 --> 01:33:46,785
Speaker 6:  which is the razor. Yeah. Like truly, I, I mean that sincerely.

1554
01:33:47,085 --> 01:33:50,825
Speaker 5:  And also apparently wooden phones, which you cared about a lot in 2014. Listen,

1555
01:33:51,135 --> 01:33:52,825
Speaker 5:  this story is very long.

1556
01:33:53,005 --> 01:33:54,185
Speaker 6:  The Moto X was sick.

1557
01:33:54,255 --> 01:33:56,145
Speaker 7:  There's two things and they, this just combines them.

1558
01:33:56,585 --> 01:34:00,225
Speaker 5:  That's exactly, can I continue to read you quotes from Rick Oslow to David Pierce

1559
01:34:00,225 --> 01:34:04,095
Speaker 5:  from the story from 2014? Sure. The ex phone team started

1560
01:34:04,095 --> 01:34:06,615
Speaker 5:  to show the wooden models to focus groups and the response was overwhelming

1561
01:34:06,785 --> 01:34:09,775
Speaker 5:  quote. People were immediately like, whoa, that's different from anything

1562
01:34:09,775 --> 01:34:12,935
Speaker 5:  I've seen before. People couldn't believe that it was actually real.

1563
01:34:15,075 --> 01:34:17,895
Speaker 6:  That's a bad quote. That's my bad. I should have cut that one out.

1564
01:34:17,965 --> 01:34:21,455
Speaker 5:  Wait. And then he goes on to say there's no supply chain for wood. Oster

1565
01:34:21,605 --> 01:34:21,895
Speaker 5:  says

1566
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:24,505
Speaker 6:  There's your headline.

1567
01:34:25,775 --> 01:34:29,265
Speaker 5:  Wood is typically used for furniture and stuff. It's a totally

1568
01:34:29,755 --> 01:34:32,265
Speaker 5:  group of people from the people we normally do business with.

1569
01:34:34,295 --> 01:34:37,105
Speaker 6:  Wood is typically used for furniture and stuff. That's the insight you come

1570
01:34:37,105 --> 01:34:37,745
Speaker 6:  to The Verge for.

1571
01:34:38,265 --> 01:34:41,345
Speaker 5:  That's like we were, we just didn't, we did we, it was a long time ago. We

1572
01:34:41,345 --> 01:34:44,545
Speaker 5:  didn't really know what we were doing yet. Yeah. We're Rick, Rick rolled

1573
01:34:44,545 --> 01:34:48,465
Speaker 5:  us. Rick rolled David Pierce in particular with Here's how hard it was to

1574
01:34:48,465 --> 01:34:49,185
Speaker 5:  make a wooden phone.

1575
01:34:49,645 --> 01:34:53,545
Speaker 6:  All I'm saying is 11 years later we're back at it. So they must have

1576
01:34:53,545 --> 01:34:54,625
Speaker 6:  been on to something. Finding

1577
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:57,445
Speaker 5:  Wood that won't wa warp, splinter or crack is hard.

1578
01:34:58,465 --> 01:35:02,355
Speaker 5:  Another, I think that was a pull quote actually. Is this one

1579
01:35:02,355 --> 01:35:05,395
Speaker 5:  wood or is it bamboo as well? The, the Moto X was bamboo, I believe

1580
01:35:05,575 --> 01:35:09,555
Speaker 6:  Alison who wrote about this and saw it. Her piece calls it a wood grain back

1581
01:35:09,555 --> 01:35:09,875
Speaker 6:  panel.

1582
01:35:10,455 --> 01:35:11,595
Speaker 5:  Oh boy. It's like a sticker.

1583
01:35:11,805 --> 01:35:15,475
Speaker 6:  Dunno what to make of the Yeah, it's, it's either like a sticker or

1584
01:35:16,025 --> 01:35:18,995
Speaker 6:  it's like wood in the way that Ikea furniture is wood.

1585
01:35:19,905 --> 01:35:22,795
Speaker 6:  It's like, it, it does make me slightly nervous. But all of this is like,

1586
01:35:22,795 --> 01:35:25,755
Speaker 6:  there's some interesting like, you know, material stuff going on, but it

1587
01:35:25,755 --> 01:35:28,795
Speaker 6:  just looks great and there's something to these things just being

1588
01:35:29,905 --> 01:35:33,475
Speaker 6:  more than a giant slab of glass that I think should be

1589
01:35:33,915 --> 01:35:36,435
Speaker 6:  explored a lot more than it has been recently. Yeah.

1590
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:39,995
Speaker 5:  And once we break up every single company, many more companies will be able

1591
01:35:39,995 --> 01:35:43,795
Speaker 5:  to build a wood supply chain. Perfect. I wanna end with

1592
01:35:43,855 --> 01:35:44,595
Speaker 5:  It is a big, think

1593
01:35:46,375 --> 01:35:50,345
Speaker 5:  YouTube turned 20 this week. We, we ran a piece about the

1594
01:35:50,345 --> 01:35:53,265
Speaker 5:  first videos and YouTube famously it was like my day at the zoo or whatever

1595
01:35:53,265 --> 01:35:57,105
Speaker 5:  it's called. And David, you wrote about YouTube itself. And then

1596
01:35:57,105 --> 01:36:00,025
Speaker 5:  YouTube TV is getting some changes and it's all kind of the same story. Like

1597
01:36:00,375 --> 01:36:04,345
Speaker 5:  there's still just random clips of stuff, but it did eventually

1598
01:36:04,365 --> 01:36:04,825
Speaker 5:  eat tv.

1599
01:36:05,905 --> 01:36:08,925
Speaker 6:  It really did eat tv. So that was the, the where I started with the story

1600
01:36:08,925 --> 01:36:12,845
Speaker 6:  was essentially trying to figure out like what is YouTube now? 'cause the

1601
01:36:13,005 --> 01:36:16,005
Speaker 6:  big change that happened at YouTube or really over the last

1602
01:36:16,945 --> 01:36:20,925
Speaker 6:  two or three years is that it became mostly a TV platform. Like

1603
01:36:20,925 --> 01:36:24,205
Speaker 6:  It is still viewed everywhere. It's still very popular, but It is like, it,

1604
01:36:24,225 --> 01:36:27,965
Speaker 6:  It is both in terms of how people watch YouTube and

1605
01:36:28,105 --> 01:36:31,725
Speaker 6:  how YouTube conceives of itself. It is mostly a TV

1606
01:36:32,085 --> 01:36:34,285
Speaker 6:  platform now. And I just think that's fascinating. So I talked to a bunch

1607
01:36:34,285 --> 01:36:37,525
Speaker 6:  of people across the company about like YouTube's conception of itself and

1608
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:40,645
Speaker 6:  tried to understand just sort of like what makes this thing go

1609
01:36:42,185 --> 01:36:46,125
Speaker 6:  and landed on, essentially, this is a, not a reference

1610
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:49,525
Speaker 6:  anyone is ever gonna remember, but there's this very famous Matt Taibbi story

1611
01:36:49,705 --> 01:36:53,445
Speaker 6:  in Rolling Stone about Goldman Sachs, where he described Goldman Sachs as

1612
01:36:53,785 --> 01:36:57,645
Speaker 6:  I'm paraphrasing, but a, a vampire squid that jumps on the

1613
01:36:57,645 --> 01:37:01,485
Speaker 6:  face of anything that smells like money and that's YouTube, but for content

1614
01:37:01,885 --> 01:37:05,245
Speaker 6:  and in a much less like society destroying way.

1615
01:37:06,865 --> 01:37:10,245
Speaker 6:  But this company's fascinating. Like I talked to the people there who do

1616
01:37:10,265 --> 01:37:13,845
Speaker 6:  the TV stuff and the people who do the gaming stuff and the people who do

1617
01:37:13,845 --> 01:37:17,805
Speaker 6:  the creator stuff. And overwhelmingly like, if you just think of YouTube

1618
01:37:17,825 --> 01:37:21,525
Speaker 6:  as like an insatiable content machine

1619
01:37:21,595 --> 01:37:25,565
Speaker 6:  that just, it will take anything that is content, however broadly you wanna

1620
01:37:25,565 --> 01:37:29,125
Speaker 6:  define that and it will put it into an algorithm that is very good at figuring

1621
01:37:29,185 --> 01:37:32,365
Speaker 6:  out what somebody is going to want and then stick it in front of you. That

1622
01:37:32,365 --> 01:37:36,085
Speaker 6:  is like, like you talk about Google Flywheels. That is Google's best

1623
01:37:36,085 --> 01:37:39,485
Speaker 6:  flywheel right now. Yeah, It is. It is unstoppable and It is working

1624
01:37:40,025 --> 01:37:41,405
Speaker 6:  way beyond anything I realized.

1625
01:37:41,845 --> 01:37:44,445
Speaker 7:  I think it's so interesting to be talking about this right after we discussed

1626
01:37:44,445 --> 01:37:48,365
Speaker 7:  the meta trial. 'cause meta they turned, or Facebook turned 20 last year,

1627
01:37:48,595 --> 01:37:52,485
Speaker 7:  YouTube turns 20 this week. And if you just look at the, the, the

1628
01:37:52,805 --> 01:37:56,725
Speaker 7:  cultural trajectory of those two platforms, they could not be more different.

1629
01:37:56,745 --> 01:38:00,165
Speaker 7:  That's so true. YouTube, I I I don't know that you'd necessarily call YouTube

1630
01:38:00,245 --> 01:38:03,845
Speaker 7:  a social platform Exactly. But I I think It is

1631
01:38:04,125 --> 01:38:07,965
Speaker 7:  probably at at a stronger place than it's ever been in many ways. And

1632
01:38:08,205 --> 01:38:10,085
Speaker 7:  Facebook, you just could not say the same thing by any stretch.

1633
01:38:11,925 --> 01:38:15,865
Speaker 7:  And IIII couldn't tell you exactly why, but maybe this is because they

1634
01:38:15,865 --> 01:38:19,465
Speaker 7:  have looked at it much more as a platform for other people's content and

1635
01:38:19,465 --> 01:38:23,385
Speaker 7:  they've just embraced that rather than I think trying to do

1636
01:38:23,385 --> 01:38:24,665
Speaker 7:  all those different social plays.

1637
01:38:25,065 --> 01:38:28,385
Speaker 5:  I kind of disagree and like a very small way. Not a, not a big way. Jake.

1638
01:38:28,385 --> 01:38:32,105
Speaker 5:  I think, I think you, you've got the shape of it, right? YouTube is a social

1639
01:38:32,425 --> 01:38:36,385
Speaker 5:  platform in that you as a user are meant to be in the

1640
01:38:36,385 --> 01:38:40,145
Speaker 5:  comment section. Hmm. You are not meant to be in the video box. There was

1641
01:38:40,145 --> 01:38:43,385
Speaker 5:  a weird period where they thought you were, everyone was supposed to be uploading

1642
01:38:43,385 --> 01:38:46,755
Speaker 5:  videos to YouTube, right? Like you can go, you like search

1643
01:38:47,225 --> 01:38:51,075
Speaker 5:  file names from a specific period of time and you get everybody's iPhone

1644
01:38:51,075 --> 01:38:54,395
Speaker 5:  videos. 'cause they thought it was just a general sharing platform that's

1645
01:38:54,395 --> 01:38:57,875
Speaker 5:  gone. They, they, they pivoted outta that really fast. Right? They invented

1646
01:38:57,895 --> 01:39:01,715
Speaker 5:  the YouTube creator Taylor Lawrence has a great history of where that

1647
01:39:01,715 --> 01:39:05,155
Speaker 5:  word came from. It came from the advertising industry actually, and MCNs,

1648
01:39:05,155 --> 01:39:09,075
Speaker 5:  like multichannel networks. They invented the YouTube creator who is

1649
01:39:09,115 --> 01:39:12,195
Speaker 5:  this like semi-professional and now very professional,

1650
01:39:13,075 --> 01:39:16,835
Speaker 5:  dominant culture maker. That's not regular people. Regular

1651
01:39:16,835 --> 01:39:19,475
Speaker 5:  people are doing social stuff on YouTube, right? They're, they're hitting

1652
01:39:19,475 --> 01:39:23,255
Speaker 5:  like, they're trying to get t series above PewDiePie. Like that's all

1653
01:39:23,255 --> 01:39:27,175
Speaker 5:  happening. Like it's very interactive in social, but it's, it's, it's not

1654
01:39:27,175 --> 01:39:30,615
Speaker 5:  in the main box. The main box is like for pros now

1655
01:39:31,195 --> 01:39:34,775
Speaker 5:  or people who wanna be pros. Whereas Instagram is still just everything all

1656
01:39:34,775 --> 01:39:38,255
Speaker 5:  at once. I think that's, that's the thing that keeps getting meta into trouble.

1657
01:39:38,945 --> 01:39:42,835
Speaker 5:  They have never built the thing that lets you, like my daughter just like

1658
01:39:43,315 --> 01:39:46,195
Speaker 5:  discovered that YouTuber is a job and now I have to stop that from now.

1659
01:39:46,475 --> 01:39:46,755
Speaker 6:  Oh, no,

1660
01:39:47,015 --> 01:39:47,555
Speaker 7:  I'm really sorry.

1661
01:39:48,645 --> 01:39:52,355
Speaker 5:  Right. But like, Instagram creator is like not really a job. TikTok is, is

1662
01:39:52,675 --> 01:39:56,435
Speaker 5:  a job. Like it's, It is just meta is in this weird space where it

1663
01:39:56,435 --> 01:39:58,075
Speaker 5:  never delineated all of those things.

1664
01:39:58,905 --> 01:40:02,795
Speaker 6:  Well, yeah, and I think, like, I remember when Threads was first launching,

1665
01:40:03,025 --> 01:40:06,475
Speaker 6:  Adam Aria was talking about, you know, there's something in the design of

1666
01:40:06,475 --> 01:40:10,275
Speaker 6:  the app where like the, the reply and the original post look the same. And

1667
01:40:10,275 --> 01:40:13,155
Speaker 6:  that's actually really important in an app like Threads or Twitter.

1668
01:40:14,655 --> 01:40:18,475
Speaker 6:  And to your point, Neil, YouTube never, ever, ever tried to do that. It always

1669
01:40:18,475 --> 01:40:22,235
Speaker 6:  had such a clear hierarchy of who you are and where you are on the platform.

1670
01:40:22,695 --> 01:40:26,475
Speaker 6:  And I think the, the thing that has made TikTok

1671
01:40:26,675 --> 01:40:29,675
Speaker 6:  interesting is that it has found the middle ground there that actually works

1672
01:40:29,775 --> 01:40:33,435
Speaker 6:  for people, right? Like the, the duets and the stitches. And they have really

1673
01:40:33,435 --> 01:40:37,315
Speaker 6:  forced YouTube to be reactive to that. But like, Jake, to

1674
01:40:37,315 --> 01:40:41,105
Speaker 6:  your point, what most people want, the vast majority of people want

1675
01:40:41,205 --> 01:40:45,065
Speaker 6:  is to mostly consume and like maybe

1676
01:40:45,095 --> 01:40:49,025
Speaker 6:  very lightly participate. And, and YouTube hit that formula early

1677
01:40:49,045 --> 01:40:52,625
Speaker 6:  on and then never ran away from it. Yeah. And like, even, even at times when

1678
01:40:52,625 --> 01:40:55,805
Speaker 6:  it looked like, like it maybe should have when like Facebook was ascendant

1679
01:40:55,805 --> 01:40:57,845
Speaker 6:  and all of a sudden it was like, oh, we, we need to make this stuff more

1680
01:40:57,845 --> 01:41:00,365
Speaker 6:  interactive and do different kinds of feeds and all this stuff. YouTube just

1681
01:41:00,365 --> 01:41:04,325
Speaker 6:  like kept being YouTube and like history just proved it right over

1682
01:41:04,325 --> 01:41:05,085
Speaker 6:  and over and over again.

1683
01:41:05,725 --> 01:41:09,545
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it's funny 'cause the content got to move up, right? The, the product

1684
01:41:09,545 --> 01:41:13,505
Speaker 5:  didn't, the product always had that delineation and the stuff

1685
01:41:13,505 --> 01:41:16,625
Speaker 5:  in the video box got more and more and more premium and now it's eating tv.

1686
01:41:16,935 --> 01:41:17,225
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1687
01:41:17,925 --> 01:41:21,825
Speaker 5:  And I, I think it's just fascinating. It's also why I think Google should

1688
01:41:21,825 --> 01:41:24,705
Speaker 5:  break itself up before the government shows up and distracts that whole company

1689
01:41:24,815 --> 01:41:28,345
Speaker 5:  away from whatever YouTube is or is becoming because it's,

1690
01:41:29,345 --> 01:41:31,705
Speaker 5:  I think YouTube looks more like Google's future than anything. And I think

1691
01:41:31,885 --> 01:41:35,865
Speaker 5:  Google kinds of, kind of knows it too, but it's just tied to this mess.

1692
01:41:36,795 --> 01:41:40,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah, no, I, I, I would agree with that. I think there's a, there's a strong

1693
01:41:40,165 --> 01:41:42,645
Speaker 6:  case to be made and people make this case. You see it from analysts and stuff

1694
01:41:42,645 --> 01:41:46,485
Speaker 6:  every once in a while, that YouTube is a substantially more valuable business

1695
01:41:46,615 --> 01:41:49,445
Speaker 6:  alone than It is inside of Google. Huh.

1696
01:41:50,325 --> 01:41:53,485
Speaker 5:  I wonder if one of the most fascinating things about Google and other people

1697
01:41:53,485 --> 01:41:55,605
Speaker 5:  have made this point for years now

1698
01:41:57,165 --> 01:42:00,505
Speaker 5:  is that no one pays attention to It is a platform

1699
01:42:01,385 --> 01:42:03,585
Speaker 5:  everyone is constantly paying attention to. Like tiktoks moderation rules.

1700
01:42:04,305 --> 01:42:07,985
Speaker 5:  Everyone is constantly paying attention to threads or X or whatever is

1701
01:42:07,985 --> 01:42:11,705
Speaker 5:  moderation rules. We all pay a lot of attention to Mark Zuckerberg and how

1702
01:42:11,705 --> 01:42:13,105
Speaker 5:  he feels about racism today.

1703
01:42:14,675 --> 01:42:18,435
Speaker 5:  Surprisingly more open to it than the day before. 'cause his company's on

1704
01:42:18,435 --> 01:42:22,195
Speaker 5:  trial. And what if corruption was good? Who knows? No one talks about YouTube

1705
01:42:22,195 --> 01:42:25,835
Speaker 5:  moderation. It just doesn't come up. We sometimes talk about YouTube radicalization,

1706
01:42:25,835 --> 01:42:29,755
Speaker 5:  what all the stuff, but the day-to-day YouTube stuff, even though

1707
01:42:29,915 --> 01:42:32,355
Speaker 5:  creators there, you know, my joke is that a creator gets their wings when

1708
01:42:32,355 --> 01:42:35,695
Speaker 5:  they make their first video about how they're mad at YouTube. Yeah. No one

1709
01:42:35,695 --> 01:42:39,535
Speaker 5:  talks about it. It's, it's, and I think that is part of the benefit of being

1710
01:42:39,535 --> 01:42:39,975
Speaker 5:  part of Google.

1711
01:42:42,085 --> 01:42:43,585
Speaker 5:  You just can't yell at YouTube like it's Google.

1712
01:42:43,935 --> 01:42:47,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I also think It is, it's a big platform that feels

1713
01:42:48,065 --> 01:42:51,165
Speaker 6:  big in a way that, like TikTok is a really big platform that feels small,

1714
01:42:51,175 --> 01:42:54,685
Speaker 6:  right? And so I think it, it's very funny talking to people about their TikTok

1715
01:42:54,685 --> 01:42:57,285
Speaker 6:  feeds because you, you slowly discover over the course of a conversation

1716
01:42:57,285 --> 01:43:01,165
Speaker 6:  that, oh, my TikTok and your TikTok have nothing to do with each other. But

1717
01:43:01,165 --> 01:43:04,445
Speaker 6:  we both sort of open the app and use it in the same way. So I feel like I'm

1718
01:43:04,445 --> 01:43:08,285
Speaker 6:  getting some kind of universal experience. YouTube is just, it just feels

1719
01:43:08,535 --> 01:43:11,885
Speaker 6:  giant in a way that I feel like no one thinks they understand YouTube, which

1720
01:43:11,885 --> 01:43:13,325
Speaker 6:  really works to YouTube's benefit.

1721
01:43:13,805 --> 01:43:17,165
Speaker 7:  I think people engage with YouTube very differently too. Right? For, for

1722
01:43:17,445 --> 01:43:20,965
Speaker 7:  Facebook, for Instagram, even for Absolutely for TikTok, you go

1723
01:43:21,405 --> 01:43:25,285
Speaker 7:  specifically to those apps, YouTube comes to you. Yeah.

1724
01:43:25,285 --> 01:43:27,845
Speaker 7:  That's not, not true for everybody, right? You still open it up on your tv,

1725
01:43:27,845 --> 01:43:31,285
Speaker 7:  you still open up on the, on, on the website and browse, but you're gonna

1726
01:43:31,285 --> 01:43:35,125
Speaker 7:  find videos embedded. You're going to be sent a link. Right? When

1727
01:43:35,125 --> 01:43:37,965
Speaker 7:  was the last time somebody sent you a link to a piece of content on Facebook?

1728
01:43:39,155 --> 01:43:40,485
Speaker 7:  Like that wasn't a spammer. Like,

1729
01:43:41,365 --> 01:43:43,765
Speaker 5:  I mean, I send people spaghetti Jesus all day long. Whatcha talking

1730
01:43:43,765 --> 01:43:46,365
Speaker 6:  About? Dude, it's so funny. I asked you, I asked a bunch of people at YouTube

1731
01:43:47,095 --> 01:43:50,965
Speaker 6:  about that because I, I, I posed to one of their engineering people

1732
01:43:51,035 --> 01:43:54,965
Speaker 6:  that, like, my, my theory of the case for YouTube is that It is a very good

1733
01:43:54,965 --> 01:43:58,445
Speaker 6:  video player that is easily embedded across the internet. And for some reason,

1734
01:43:58,585 --> 01:44:01,925
Speaker 6:  no one else has figured out how to do that. And the guy kind of hemmed and

1735
01:44:01,965 --> 01:44:05,925
Speaker 6:  hawed and he gave, he gave me a, a good explanation for why that's not

1736
01:44:05,985 --> 01:44:08,565
Speaker 6:  the whole answer. And a lot of his answer is actually in the piece.

1737
01:44:09,905 --> 01:44:13,805
Speaker 6:  But then I was like, but, but explain to me why no one has done a good enough.

1738
01:44:13,875 --> 01:44:17,125
Speaker 6:  Like why aren't embeds as good as YouTube's? And he was kind of like, I don't

1739
01:44:17,125 --> 01:44:17,685
Speaker 6:  know. It's weird.

1740
01:44:19,475 --> 01:44:23,045
Speaker 6:  It's like you can't do it with music. Like there are no music embeds anywhere

1741
01:44:23,045 --> 01:44:26,245
Speaker 6:  on the internet that are as good as YouTube music videos, which is hugely

1742
01:44:26,605 --> 01:44:30,125
Speaker 6:  powerful for YouTube. And you, you just poke at that across everything. And

1743
01:44:30,125 --> 01:44:33,845
Speaker 6:  it's like the fact that none of these other platforms have invested in,

1744
01:44:33,875 --> 01:44:37,805
Speaker 6:  like you said, Jake, that sort of experience I have somewhere else that I

1745
01:44:38,045 --> 01:44:42,005
Speaker 6:  interact with. This content is just weird to me. And YouTube is ubiquitous

1746
01:44:42,005 --> 01:44:42,285
Speaker 6:  that way,

1747
01:44:42,505 --> 01:44:46,345
Speaker 5:  But you know, it's still connected to all the Google stuff. 'cause YouTube

1748
01:44:46,365 --> 01:44:49,465
Speaker 5:  is part of Google, which wants the web to be good, which invests in big web

1749
01:44:49,465 --> 01:44:53,345
Speaker 5:  containers Fair. Yeah. That its crawlers can see that are interoperable

1750
01:44:53,345 --> 01:44:56,785
Speaker 5:  across different browsers, all the web stuff fed into YouTube. Whereas I

1751
01:44:56,785 --> 01:44:59,745
Speaker 5:  think if they didn't have that pressure, they might be more closed. Like

1752
01:44:59,745 --> 01:45:00,505
Speaker 5:  all the other embeds.

1753
01:45:00,505 --> 01:45:01,745
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that's a fair's a fair point. Yeah.

1754
01:45:02,025 --> 01:45:05,225
Speaker 5:  I will say, I think it was either TikTok or Instagram that after we launched

1755
01:45:05,305 --> 01:45:08,265
Speaker 5:  a redesign, they made their embeds behave better. I was like, these embeds

1756
01:45:08,265 --> 01:45:11,945
Speaker 5:  are too tall for our design. And they were like, I don't remember which one

1757
01:45:11,945 --> 01:45:14,905
Speaker 5:  it was. They were like, I, I think it was Instagram. They're like, oh, that's

1758
01:45:14,905 --> 01:45:17,545
Speaker 5:  bad. But no one uses these embeds, so we never got this feedback.

1759
01:45:19,275 --> 01:45:23,185
Speaker 5:  Weird. All right. That's it. Tell me, tell I, I feel like

1760
01:45:23,185 --> 01:45:25,785
Speaker 5:  I've asked for a lot of emails from people. Send us your party speakers.

1761
01:45:26,555 --> 01:45:29,845
Speaker 5:  Tell me if you would buy Chrome and how much you've spent on it, and then

1762
01:45:29,915 --> 01:45:33,295
Speaker 5:  tell me about YouTube. I'm, I'm just sort of dying to know, like everyone

1763
01:45:33,295 --> 01:45:36,735
Speaker 5:  has a different YouTube, right? We're 20 years in. I have friends who only

1764
01:45:36,735 --> 01:45:39,455
Speaker 5:  watch YouTube, don't have streaming services. They just watch YouTube.

1765
01:45:40,285 --> 01:45:42,975
Speaker 6:  Okay. Real quick, before we go, let's, let's just do this. If you were to

1766
01:45:42,975 --> 01:45:46,375
Speaker 6:  go to youtube.com right now, what would it show you? Jake, you go first.

1767
01:45:46,875 --> 01:45:47,095
Speaker 6:  Oh,

1768
01:45:47,095 --> 01:45:49,815
Speaker 7:  It's all chess videos and Bon Appetit cooking content.

1769
01:45:50,315 --> 01:45:54,255
Speaker 6:  Oh, okay. Like chess tutorials or like Magnus Carlson. Like

1770
01:45:54,255 --> 01:45:54,695
Speaker 6:  being cool.

1771
01:45:54,955 --> 01:45:58,895
Speaker 7:  Oh, it's b Both. Both, yeah. It's like, It is like play

1772
01:45:58,895 --> 01:46:02,645
Speaker 7:  byplay. It's hugely embarrassing. I'm so sorry.

1773
01:46:03,685 --> 01:46:06,085
Speaker 6:  I love this for you. Neela, what's yours? Oh,

1774
01:46:06,085 --> 01:46:08,245
Speaker 5:  I've turned off all the tracking. It doesn't show me anything. It just begs

1775
01:46:08,245 --> 01:46:09,205
Speaker 5:  me to turn the tracking back on.

1776
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:11,725
Speaker 6:  Get That's smart. Wow. You get just, it's like the, the one, no,

1777
01:46:11,865 --> 01:46:15,165
Speaker 5:  The line of text. They, they started, I think they've realized that this

1778
01:46:15,165 --> 01:46:18,405
Speaker 5:  was working too well. So they, they started flashing recommendations and

1779
01:46:18,405 --> 01:46:20,325
Speaker 5:  they take them away and say, your tracking is off.

1780
01:46:22,215 --> 01:46:23,195
Speaker 5:  And it's like, yeah, I know.

1781
01:46:23,505 --> 01:46:24,595
Speaker 6:  It's like, I'd love to show you this video. But what

1782
01:46:24,595 --> 01:46:28,355
Speaker 5:  I had the tracking, it was a lot of it was in the Covid era before I turned

1783
01:46:28,355 --> 01:46:32,195
Speaker 5:  the tracking off. It was a lot of, I don't remember the channel, a

1784
01:46:32,195 --> 01:46:35,995
Speaker 5:  guy who restores things, but he would like take an old drill and like

1785
01:46:35,995 --> 01:46:39,195
Speaker 5:  sandblast it and repaint it. And I found this very calming. I was like, I

1786
01:46:39,195 --> 01:46:42,635
Speaker 5:  just, I need projects to come to a conclusion because nothing in Covid felt

1787
01:46:42,635 --> 01:46:46,005
Speaker 5:  like a conclusion. So I would just watch this guy, he is like, I fixed this

1788
01:46:46,075 --> 01:46:49,045
Speaker 5:  hand mixer. I'm like, you did it. It is very good.

1789
01:46:49,475 --> 01:46:53,445
Speaker 6:  That is really good. Mine, I just went to youtube.com and mine is,

1790
01:46:54,765 --> 01:46:58,525
Speaker 6:  I would say a mix of female singer songwriter music videos,

1791
01:46:59,695 --> 01:47:03,165
Speaker 6:  which there's a lot of right now soccer highlights and

1792
01:47:03,775 --> 01:47:06,925
Speaker 6:  parks and rec competition. Oh, very good. Solid. That's my, that's my YouTube
