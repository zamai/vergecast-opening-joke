00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,040
Speaker 3:  Welcome to the Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Screens Within

3
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,800
Speaker 3:  Screens Within Screens. I'm your friend, David Pierce, and this is

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,680
Speaker 3:  the third and last episode of our mini series about the future of music.

5
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,560
Speaker 3:  And for this episode, I wanna talk about live music, but not the live

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,720
Speaker 3:  music you're probably thinking

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,120
Speaker 3:  of. If you wanna know what the concert of the future looks like, we have

8
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,040
Speaker 3:  to go back to April 23rd, 2020, and then we

9
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,640
Speaker 3:  have to

10
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,040
Speaker 3:  go into Fortnite. It's 7:00 PM Eastern Thursday night, and

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,920
Speaker 3:  the Battle Royal game suddenly turns into this huge concert

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,920
Speaker 3:  arena with a big stage right in the middle of the water. There's a round

13
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,720
Speaker 3:  screen above the stage with lots of avatars gathered around it. It looks

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,680
Speaker 3:  like a concert, but then as the music builds right before the

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,520
Speaker 3:  show starts, things start to change. There's no musician

16
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,320
Speaker 3:  avatar that appears on the screen. Instead, this big orb

17
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,040
Speaker 3:  thing with glowing lights and speakers, kind of like you'd

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,800
Speaker 3:  mashed all the gear you need to put on a concert into a

19
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,200
Speaker 3:  ball just starts floating in from the sky

20
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,760
Speaker 3:  and then a huge like hundred feet tall

21
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,240
Speaker 3:  animated Travis Scott appears on stage.

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,160
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gone on you with the roll Young Flame here in

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,720
Speaker 4:  Ome,

24
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,440
Speaker 3:  He spends the next few minutes stomping all over the island in

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,280
Speaker 3:  Fortnite, playing old and new songs. At one point he lights

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,200
Speaker 3:  everything on fire and then at another point he takes

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,120
Speaker 3:  the whole crowd underwater. It all sounds insane to say out

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,040
Speaker 3:  loud, but it was so cool. And then after about nine

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,280
Speaker 3:  minutes it was over.

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,780
Speaker 3:  You really can't overstate how big a deal that first Travis Scott

31
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,380
Speaker 3:  concert was. More than 12 million people watched that

32
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,980
Speaker 3:  first show, and more than 27 million saw it in one of

33
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,540
Speaker 3:  the five showings over the course of that weekend. Fortnite described it

34
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,380
Speaker 3:  kind of like a concert tour with different dates depending on where you

35
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,140
Speaker 3:  lived, and over the course of that weekend, Fortnite players could also get

36
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,900
Speaker 3:  Travis Scott emotes and gear to play the game with as well. Travis Scott

37
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,700
Speaker 3:  wasn't the first artist to play a concert in a digital space. That's actually

38
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,500
Speaker 3:  been a thing for a long time. I remember back in 2006 when Duran

39
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,400
Speaker 3:  Duran was playing a concert inside a bunch of colored cubes in

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,120
Speaker 3:  Second Life, which now sounds like a very old sentence to say out loud, but

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,520
Speaker 3:  it was cool.

42
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,480
Speaker 3:  Scott wasn't even the first to play in Fortnite, but the spectacle

43
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,160
Speaker 3:  of the show and the huge number of fans that showed up and the

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,000
Speaker 3:  overwhelming response that it created was a real moment in the

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,960
Speaker 3:  music industry. It caused a lot of people to start asking, What does

46
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,520
Speaker 3:  music in the metaverse look like? Oh, actually

47
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,520
Speaker 3:  a quick point on the word metaverse here. That word you probably

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,240
Speaker 3:  already know really doesn't mean anything. Meta means it to be

49
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,160
Speaker 3:  like vr, digital spaces where nobody has legs, but

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,080
Speaker 3:  we all sit in meetings all day. I guess some people think about it as what

51
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,520
Speaker 3:  we've seen in books like Snow Crash and Ready Player One, these super

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,480
Speaker 3:  immersive digital worlds we might all live in in the future, but I

53
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,320
Speaker 3:  would argue the Metaverse is also Fortnite and Roblox and Minecraft, and

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,120
Speaker 3:  basically any digital place where people hang out together in real

55
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,920
Speaker 3:  time, the tech doesn't matter really, at least for our purposes. The

56
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,640
Speaker 3:  idea is that it's people being together in digital spaces. That's the

57
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,760
Speaker 3:  metaverse that we care about.

58
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,000
Speaker 3:  So back to the question, what does music look like in the Metaverse?

59
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,240
Speaker 3:  One of the people asking that question was CBI de Gogo Jack, who was

60
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,080
Speaker 3:  then the head of music business development at Spotify. He's a long-time

61
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,840
Speaker 3:  music industry guy and is permanently looking for new ways for artists

62
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,400
Speaker 3:  to grow and make money.

63
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,840
Speaker 5:  I've been increasingly obsessed with artists,

64
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,960
Speaker 5:  artist success artists and fan connection and

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,680
Speaker 5:  enabling all of that. You know, my role at Interscope Records

66
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,600
Speaker 5:  was about finding more opportunity for artists to make more money

67
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,440
Speaker 5:  through the label. When I moved over to Spotify, it was a really similar

68
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,360
Speaker 5:  thing. How can Spotify make more revenue that we can then pass through

69
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,800
Speaker 5:  to musicians and how can we create emerging artist

70
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,840
Speaker 5:  programs or increasing artist equity programs, and how can we make sure that

71
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,280
Speaker 5:  those are really present in the world?

72
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,320
Speaker 3:  The spoiler ending to Kari's story is that he's now the head of music

73
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,280
Speaker 3:  partnerships at Roblox working on bringing more artists and music onto

74
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,040
Speaker 3:  the platform. So you could safely say he bought the whole music in the

75
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,000
Speaker 3:  Metaverse idea. I buy it too, honestly, The Metaverse is this

76
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,000
Speaker 3:  unknown new, messy thing where nobody knows the rules

77
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,920
Speaker 3:  or how it's supposed to work, but there's something to the live music thing.

78
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,920
Speaker 3:  It feels big and connective and exciting, and there's

79
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,880
Speaker 3:  clearly something that works for people on an emotional level. Here's how

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,680
Speaker 3:  C explained it.

81
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,720
Speaker 5:  I recently ran across a concept called reality

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,640
Speaker 5:  privilege. Reality privilege. Essentially it means that if

83
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,440
Speaker 5:  you live in an interesting place and you

84
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,320
Speaker 5:  have an interesting cohort of friends, but the truth is

85
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,800
Speaker 5:  that most people don't live in very interesting places

86
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,800
Speaker 5:  with very interesting cohorts of friends. Or even if they do,

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,480
Speaker 5:  they make real connections in digital spaces. So

88
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,680
Speaker 5:  I think that's a lot of the catalysts and the driver and the

89
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,880
Speaker 5:  appeal of a lot of what's happening across

90
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,640
Speaker 5:  Roblox and platforms like Roblox. I think from a concert

91
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,600
Speaker 5:  perspective, it's a concert, but it's a concert. Plus you

92
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,480
Speaker 5:  get to hear music, but you get to have unicorn

93
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,280
Speaker 5:  wings or something and you get to climb up

94
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,520
Speaker 5:  on Charlie Xcx and you get to share the stage with her and

95
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,400
Speaker 5:  it's more interesting or more interactive than

96
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,080
Speaker 5:  you know, a physical environment could be. So it it becomes

97
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,560
Speaker 5:  a whole different medium or event in its own way.

98
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,800
Speaker 3:  The most important thing to understand here, I think, is that there's

99
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,720
Speaker 3:  way less distance between a real life interaction and a digital

100
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,520
Speaker 3:  interaction than there once was. This is one of those things that if you're

101
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,400
Speaker 3:  under like 25, it sounds super obvious and if you're

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,280
Speaker 3:  over about 40, it sounds totally preposterous, but hanging out

103
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,800
Speaker 3:  in video games that's hanging out, it counts, it's real.

104
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,720
Speaker 3:  And going to a concert in Roblox and jumping up and down on the virtual

105
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,040
Speaker 3:  stage and meeting the artist's avatar after the show,

106
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,000
Speaker 3:  if that's not all the way as cool and memorable as seeing it in the real

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,840
Speaker 3:  world, it's a lot closer than you might think. I really do remember

108
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,680
Speaker 3:  that Travis Scott show as vividly as a lot of IL concerts

109
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,640
Speaker 3:  I've seen in the past. And like CBI said, it also opens up these

110
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,400
Speaker 3:  kinds of experiences to lots of new people. He mentioned one recent

111
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,360
Speaker 3:  event in Roblox, an album listening party with the artist, soccer mommy as

112
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,880
Speaker 3:  the kind of thing most people never get to be part of, but that are suddenly

113
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,400
Speaker 3:  available to millions of people all over the world.

114
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,560
Speaker 5:  She gave her fans an opportunity to hang out with her virtually. And you

115
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,440
Speaker 5:  know, there's a lot of these moments where these fans would geek

116
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,280
Speaker 5:  out and they would type in chat like, I can't believe that I got to meet

117
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,960
Speaker 5:  soccer. Mommy.

118
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,840
Speaker 3:  This is the thing about Metaverse music I think is so interesting in the

119
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,560
Speaker 3:  real world, there are only so many ways you can put on a concert or

120
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,120
Speaker 3:  music experience, big stage, lots of light a screen.

121
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,960
Speaker 3:  There's cool stuff you can do, but the boundaries are pretty clear

122
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,720
Speaker 3:  and pretty aggressive, especially when you have to tear the whole thing down

123
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,280
Speaker 3:  and do it again somewhere else the next day In digital spaces, you get to

124
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,480
Speaker 3:  kind of start over and rethink the whole idea,

125
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,800
Speaker 3:  but should you, We'll get to that in one second,

126
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,520
Speaker 3:  but first we're gonna take a quick break.

127
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,190
Speaker 3:  Welcome back. When you ask the question, what should a Metaverse

128
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,830
Speaker 3:  concert look like? The most important thing to know is that nobody

129
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,390
Speaker 3:  knows anything, and there's been a lot of experimenting over the last few

130
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,190
Speaker 3:  years. The DJ Marshmallow, who I think actually does get the

131
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,390
Speaker 3:  credit as the first Fortnight concert ever played a pretty

132
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,590
Speaker 3:  traditional looking concert. Yo,

133
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,950
Speaker 7:  What is up Fortnite? What's up? Pleasant part. My name is

134
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,670
Speaker 7:  Marshmallows.

135
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,870
Speaker 3:  There were some animated dancers on top of the stage, but it was still a

136
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,430
Speaker 3:  stage and some lights and some screens. Though I guess in the audience you

137
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,270
Speaker 3:  could fly during the concert, so that was definitely new. I

138
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,350
Speaker 7:  Want everybody to fly with me right now. Who's ready to fly? Let's go.

139
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,110
Speaker 3:  Last year, lil Nas X played a concert in Roblox that was a lot like the

140
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,070
Speaker 3:  Travis Scott show, a big cowboy hat wearing lil Nas dancing

141
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,550
Speaker 3:  around lots of different backgrounds.

142
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,310
Speaker 6:  21

143
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,870
Speaker 3:  Pilots did one that I thought was particularly cool. They had this Choose

144
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,550
Speaker 3:  your own Adventure concert and the crowd would vote after each song to

145
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,230
Speaker 3:  decide what they heard next, and

146
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,030
Speaker 8:  This next song is called The Outside.

147
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,310
Speaker 3:  There was also a cool Phoebe Bridgers concert in Minecraft where

148
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,190
Speaker 3:  she showed up playing on an old CRT TV while her blocky avatar

149
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,470
Speaker 3:  ran around the virtual stage

150
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,750
Speaker 9:  From Got Bored.

151
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,190
Speaker 3:  All of these, again sound sort of ridiculous to hear, but they're fun. They

152
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,390
Speaker 3:  work, they feel like concerts.

153
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,630
Speaker 3:  A couple of weeks ago, the Chainsmokers did a concert in Roblox that was

154
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,230
Speaker 3:  one of the platform's more epic productions.

155
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,550
Speaker 3:  The shtick of the event was that the Chainsmokers were on a plane late to

156
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,440
Speaker 3:  a music festival and all of a sudden the plane flew into a vortex at the

157
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,200
Speaker 3:  Bermuda Triangle. Somehow this leads to deciding the best idea

158
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,800
Speaker 3:  is just to have a concert on the wing of a plane instead, which

159
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,760
Speaker 3:  you know, sure, they played for about 20 minutes. Again, also going

160
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,200
Speaker 3:  underwater and through a city and all over the place.

161
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,840
Speaker 3:  The dominant aesthetic of these shows, I would say is larger

162
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,120
Speaker 3:  than life avatars playing in slightly other worldly places

163
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,840
Speaker 3:  while dozens or hundreds or thousands of game avatars

164
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,640
Speaker 3:  bounce and fly around. The bouncing is always my

165
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,200
Speaker 3:  favorite part.

166
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,560
Speaker 10:  All everybody,

167
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,160
Speaker 3:  It's like one giant mosh pit, everybody just jumping on each other's heads,

168
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,480
Speaker 3:  but without all the bruises and torn clothes back

169
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,400
Speaker 11:  Home to you

170
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,120
Speaker 3:  Often there's also some kind of mini game you can play during the concert

171
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,200
Speaker 3:  or some item to collect or some related fun thing

172
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,720
Speaker 3:  to do while the music plays. But like I said, this is all still

173
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,600
Speaker 3:  really early and most of the Metaverse concerts we've seen have been

174
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,360
Speaker 3:  huge, complicated one off productions. It's like making a

175
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,240
Speaker 3:  massively complicated music video or like a video game every time

176
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,200
Speaker 3:  you want to do anything, which just won't be possible for most artists. So

177
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,880
Speaker 3:  how do you make Metaverse music that scales? That's one thing I talked a

178
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,760
Speaker 3:  lot about with Connell Burn, the CEO of iHeart Media's digital audio group.

179
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,360
Speaker 12:  Anywhere we can show up as a widely distributed audio company that is

180
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,120
Speaker 12:  digital, that is my purview.

181
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,080
Speaker 3:  IHeart is this radio giant. They've made some big moves

182
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,600
Speaker 3:  into podcasting and music streaming over the last few years and

183
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,600
Speaker 3:  recently went kind of all in on the Metaverse Con told me he's

184
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,560
Speaker 3:  convinced that there's something big going on here, but he sees the space

185
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,320
Speaker 3:  a little differently than some others.

186
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,040
Speaker 12:  We don't think actually that at least right now, the

187
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,840
Speaker 12:  event Travis Scott type avatar driven

188
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,880
Speaker 12:  concerts are scalable. I think anyone would agree with that. That's

189
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,720
Speaker 12:  okay. By the way, if it's a one off, I think it's a little can be

190
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,720
Speaker 12:  a little confusing to fans on that platform. That's not

191
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,880
Speaker 12:  what we wanted to do. We wanted to build a place that was predictable,

192
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,920
Speaker 12:  natively integrated into the platform you were on, and a place like

193
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,080
Speaker 12:  you felt like was persistent. You could come back every day or once a month.

194
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,520
Speaker 12:  It's up to you trying to land somewhere in that spectrum.

195
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,640
Speaker 3:  IHeart recently opened a concert venue called iHeart Land in both

196
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,320
Speaker 3:  Fortnite and Roblox. They have events planned over the next year

197
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,920
Speaker 3:  and it actually looks like a concert venue sort of

198
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,400
Speaker 3:  In Fortnite for instance. It's an island, a heart shaped one, obviously with

199
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,160
Speaker 3:  a complex of buildings on it. Right in the middle there's a big stage with

200
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,960
Speaker 3:  a big Red State Farm logo on top of it because the whole thing is sponsored

201
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,880
Speaker 3:  by State Farm and there's a sort of complex around the stage with

202
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,400
Speaker 3:  four buildings that each have a mini game inside. There's one called Speed

203
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,200
Speaker 3:  of Sound, one called Leap of Faith. The games all sound and play

204
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,080
Speaker 3:  pretty much exactly like fall guys. There are a bunch of other

205
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,920
Speaker 3:  buildings around that are mostly just for show and apparently for some hardcore

206
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,440
Speaker 3:  game that's coming later off to one side. There's a dedicated

207
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,280
Speaker 3:  screenshot area, which is like a red carpet with lots of corporate logos

208
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,880
Speaker 3:  where you can take a picture of your avatar to say that you were there. But

209
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,800
Speaker 3:  obviously the stage is the thing. Here's how Atlas Creative, the company

210
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,040
Speaker 3:  that developed it for iHeart described the process in a YouTube video.

211
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,840
Speaker 13:  We started by making a massive frame for the video player that is big enough

212
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,440
Speaker 13:  to be seen across the island on top of the screen. We sculpted State Farm's

213
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,840
Speaker 13:  logo by kit bashing over 1000 different shapes together to form the letters.

214
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,440
Speaker 13:  This was a very difficult process, but it turned out amazing.

215
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,880
Speaker 3:  It all sounds very branded and it is, but so a real life

216
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,640
Speaker 3:  concerts, so I'll roll with it. The first concert at I Heartland was Charlie

217
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,240
Speaker 3:  Po and it was way less exciting than the Travis Scott show.

218
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,120
Speaker 3:  It happened a couple of weeks ago in Fortnite, and basically all that happened

219
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,760
Speaker 3:  was we stood there and bopped around as a pre-recorded Charlie

220
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,440
Speaker 3:  Poth concert played on the big screen.

221
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,000
Speaker 3:  You can see how this is way more repeatable. It's just a video file playing

222
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,560
Speaker 3:  on a screen inside of a game, but there are still some unique things about

223
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,200
Speaker 3:  it, as Con told me that he thinks make it feel like more than just a video.

224
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,560
Speaker 12:  So first of all, even in that 2D video, Charlie put is calling out the

225
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,040
Speaker 12:  Fortnite audience that he is playing to. Not a big thing, but that's a thing

226
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,880
Speaker 12:  he's aware of the platform he's on. The second thing is there's a bunch

227
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,520
Speaker 12:  of gameplay leading up to the actual concert itself. Trivia

228
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,400
Speaker 12:  with and by Charlie put himself, there is a bunch

229
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,680
Speaker 12:  of mini games that we've built in I Heartland and Fortnite. You'll see the

230
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,400
Speaker 12:  same in Roblox, that players are totally encouraged

231
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,360
Speaker 12:  to break away from the show and go, just do that if they want to. There

232
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,320
Speaker 12:  is a whole commerce of being able to collect and spend

233
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,720
Speaker 12:  currency soft, iHeart currency as you see fit. So it's this

234
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,640
Speaker 12:  blend of, okay, I'm here for what is a quote unquote traditional media

235
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,760
Speaker 12:  2D show, but you've clearly blended this a bunch with the platform

236
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,440
Speaker 12:  that you're on. That thoughtfulness was super important to us.

237
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,400
Speaker 3:  There are two things in there that I heard from a lot of people about music

238
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,720
Speaker 3:  in the Metaverse. One that it's really important that the artists

239
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,880
Speaker 3:  actually address and seem to understand where they are. It's like the

240
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,920
Speaker 3:  musicians who play a different city every night yelling, Hello Chicago, and

241
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,240
Speaker 3:  you see this a lot in the metaverse too. Artists saying, Hey, it's a Roblox,

242
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,440
Speaker 3:  or Fortnite or Minecraft,

243
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,160
Speaker 7:  IHeart Land. How are y'all feeling tonight? Yo, what is up

244
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,080
Speaker 7:  Fortnite? What's up Pleasant Park? What's up Roblox? What's up Roblox?

245
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,320
Speaker 7:  How you guys doing

246
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,040
Speaker 3:  Today? What's, and two, it's really important that there's more to do than

247
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,000
Speaker 3:  just the concert. Everybody is starting to develop mini games and build

248
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,720
Speaker 3:  side quests and give people things to do that feel native to the

249
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,120
Speaker 3:  platform that they're on. One underrated thing about a Metaverse concert,

250
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,680
Speaker 3:  and I know this sounds weird, is that the sound never gets worse.

251
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,880
Speaker 3:  You can run off to play a game or just go wander around for a bit and it's

252
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,720
Speaker 3:  still gonna sound like you're in the perfect position right between the speakers.

253
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,400
Speaker 3:  I heard a lot about skew morphism from the people I talked to about Metaverse

254
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,000
Speaker 3:  concerts. Skew morphism is basically the idea of taking something new

255
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,960
Speaker 3:  and recreating an old thing that feels familiar in the new space.

256
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,160
Speaker 3:  Computer desktops that looked like desks or the old Apple Notes app that

257
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,040
Speaker 3:  looked exactly like a yellow legal pad that's skew morphism, and right

258
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,920
Speaker 3:  now, sch morphism isn't actually a bad idea. Many people who come to

259
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,600
Speaker 3:  these concerts are new to the platforms that they're hosted on and often

260
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,360
Speaker 3:  new to the whole concept of the metaphors. So giving them a concert that

261
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,320
Speaker 3:  feels like a concert is a good idea and Roblox is K

262
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,000
Speaker 3:  told me. It kind of helps artists figure out what to do too, but

263
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,440
Speaker 3:  eventually you get to move on to the bigger, cooler, more

264
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,920
Speaker 3:  platform native stuff.

265
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,000
Speaker 5:  When you first introduce a concert into these environments, you want

266
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,880
Speaker 5:  the camera on the camera phone to make a shutter sound. Even though there's

267
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,800
Speaker 5:  no shutter in the digital camera, you're training people to

268
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,200
Speaker 5:  expect some aspects of what they've seen in real life or

269
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,120
Speaker 5:  what they've experienced in physical world. You're training them to experience

270
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,880
Speaker 5:  that in a digital sphere. But once people become accustomed to

271
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,920
Speaker 5:  what's possible in a Roblox concert, then we can

272
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,440
Speaker 5:  stretch what's possible in a Roblox concert. You can have it on the wing

273
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,400
Speaker 5:  of a plane or underwater, but there's Fire

274
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:14,320
Speaker 3:  IHeart's Tunnel burden was a little more conservative on the subject, but

275
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,680
Speaker 3:  I think feels kind of the same way.

276
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,400
Speaker 12:  We're trying to land in the middle of that spectrum where it's a

277
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,600
Speaker 12:  2D video on a large state farm park theater

278
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,600
Speaker 12:  screen, but it's also totally entrenched in all the

279
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,400
Speaker 12:  tropes and memes and gameplay of the platform that you're on as well.

280
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,640
Speaker 3:  One way I've come to think about this moment we're in is like the early

281
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,600
Speaker 3:  days of film. Back then a lot of movies were just filmed versions of

282
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,120
Speaker 3:  plays, but eventually everyone learned and developed a new

283
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,920
Speaker 3:  vocabulary, How things Cut, where people go, how cameras move,

284
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,600
Speaker 3:  all that kind of stuff. And I think we're gonna get the same thing here.

285
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,640
Speaker 3:  It'll be a real life concert in a digital space for a while

286
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,400
Speaker 3:  before we start to figure out what new and better things make sense

287
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,480
Speaker 3:  that never made sense or were even possible before. Maybe it's underwater

288
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,080
Speaker 3:  concerts, maybe it's mini games that move to the beat of the song. Maybe

289
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,760
Speaker 3:  it's something else we haven't even figured out yet. A big part of what's

290
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,480
Speaker 3:  left to figure out is how to make these things feel more like a

291
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,280
Speaker 3:  community and more interactive. The future of entertainment in general

292
