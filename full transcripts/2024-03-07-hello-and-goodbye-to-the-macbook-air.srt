Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, David Pierce, and Alex Cranz discuss Apple's upgraded MacBook Air, the EU's Digital Markets Act deadline for tech’s biggest “gatekeepers”, and a bunch of tech news from this week.


2
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,595
Speaker 4:  Hello, And. Welcome to Vergecast, the flagship podcast of European

3
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:24,235
Speaker 4:  regulations.

4
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:27,275
Speaker 5:  Oof. Not the most exciting one we've ever done.

5
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:32,315
Speaker 4:  It's not great. Look, If, you go talk

6
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:36,275
Speaker 4:  to like entrepreneur, founder, guys,

7
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:39,515
Speaker 4:  professors, business school professors. That's the word I was looking for.

8
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:42,915
Speaker 4:  And you're like, what's a good time to start a business? They're like, regulatory

9
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:45,995
Speaker 4:  change provides opportunities for new business to form. And they say this

10
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:49,435
Speaker 4:  in an officious academic way and they push their glasses up in their nose

11
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:52,835
Speaker 4:  and they walk away smoking a pipe. This is that moment

12
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:57,435
Speaker 4:  only everyone is also having the most emotional reactions

13
00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:00,395
Speaker 4:  to change. Yeah. That are possible.

14
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:05,195
Speaker 4:  It's, it's, it's, it's a lot. Anyway, I'm your friend. NELI. David. Pierce

15
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:07,835
Speaker 4:  is here. Hi Alex. Cranz is here from Texas.

16
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,915
Speaker 6:  Yes. I I am currently in the 1970s in Texas.

17
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:14,235
Speaker 6:  Judging from my background right

18
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:14,955
Speaker 4:  Now, it's a lot.

19
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:15,755
Speaker 6:  So it's a lot.

20
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:19,035
Speaker 4:  You got the room divider. It's, there's a lot going on back there.

21
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:22,315
Speaker 5:  It's a good time. It's a good time. The one decorative plate behind you is,

22
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:26,195
Speaker 5:  is every house I've ever been in in my life, there's one decorative plate

23
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:27,955
Speaker 5:  and I always appreciate it. Well,

24
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:31,475
Speaker 6:  You can't see 'em, but there are, there is more than one decorative plate

25
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:32,635
Speaker 6:  in this space.

26
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:37,115
Speaker 4:  Everyone pull over in your cars and mail a picture of your decorative plate

27
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:38,595
Speaker 4:  to David at The Verge dot com.

28
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:39,315
Speaker 5:  Yes, please. Thank you.

29
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:43,395
Speaker 4:  Now if that, we do an entire installer that is just photos of

30
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:46,315
Speaker 4:  decorative plates. That's pretty good. That's fair. I

31
00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:49,835
Speaker 5:  Should say, speaking of emails that you have requested to everyone who emailed

32
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:53,475
Speaker 5:  asking for Eli's 10,000 word feature on the Samsung Frame tv.

33
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:58,355
Speaker 5:  It has been greenlit. I hear you. And now what I would like you to do is

34
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:00,885
Speaker 5:  yell at NELI for, for not filing 10,000 words about the same

35
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:01,485
Speaker 6:  Time NELI

36
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:05,365
Speaker 4:  And TV where it Yeah, just get it done. I have a, I I've, I've already

37
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,365
Speaker 4:  begun to do some reporting, I will tell you,

38
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,485
Speaker 4:  and it is the silliest reporting of all time.

39
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:14,565
Speaker 5:  Does it mean just yelling at your tv?

40
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:18,525
Speaker 4:  No, I just ran into the person who runs the art store on the train.

41
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:23,045
Speaker 4:  That's my reporting. He was like, what's up?

42
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:26,125
Speaker 4:  Like, there you go. So I'm work, I'm working on it.

43
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:29,245
Speaker 5:  That's kind, it's your version of all the people who say like, there are

44
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:31,965
Speaker 5:  all these politics reporters who are like, the best way to get scoops is

45
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:35,765
Speaker 5:  just get on like an Acela car on Amtrak between New York

46
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:39,245
Speaker 5:  and DC and just listen to people's phone calls. Yeah. Yours is just like,

47
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:43,245
Speaker 5:  get on one going into New York City and ask what startup they found.

48
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:47,085
Speaker 4:  Pretty much, pretty much. I love it. What Samsung

49
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:50,925
Speaker 4:  acquisition were you in the, in the mid 2010s? I'm,

50
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:54,165
Speaker 4:  I'm, I'm working on it. I will say if you're watching this on YouTube, you,

51
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:58,285
Speaker 4:  I'm in the new studio that our producer Liam has built for me mostly

52
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:02,285
Speaker 4:  by mailing me Amazon packages, which is great, but he put up the wall right

53
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:06,125
Speaker 4:  behind me. Very good. Great. With a circular saw that Liam and there

54
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,805
Speaker 4:  is a Frame TV that is yet to be hung on the wall behind me, just looming

55
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,765
Speaker 4:  over the show with a Verge cast logo on it. That's good. It's gonna be

56
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:16,925
Speaker 4:  great. I can't get away from them if I tried, but I will. I'm gonna do it.

57
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,965
Speaker 4:  I have a lot to say about the Frame tv. That is not this show though. This

58
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:23,885
Speaker 4:  episode of the show, there's actual news. There's not

59
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:27,445
Speaker 4:  just me having feelings about mid-range television that we've tared up bit.

60
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,845
Speaker 4:  There's new MacBook Air, we got some Microsoft News coming, there's iPad

61
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:35,325
Speaker 4:  rumors, then there is the Digital Markets Act in Europe, which went into

62
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:39,085
Speaker 4:  effect today as we are speaking all the big platforms from Google,

63
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:43,885
Speaker 4:  Facebook, apple, they're all changing. All of those people,

64
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:48,405
Speaker 4:  I would say are coping in whatever

65
00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:50,885
Speaker 4:  way you wish to interpret the word cope.

66
00:04:51,815 --> 00:04:54,325
Speaker 5:  There are a lot of people who need hugs it seems like. Yeah,

67
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:56,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Cope is a generous term.

68
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:58,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

69
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:02,925
Speaker 4:  In whichever way you wish to interpret the word cope,

70
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:08,285
Speaker 4:  however you wanna interpret the word cope, I would say that our major platforms

71
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:09,565
Speaker 4:  are coping. That's

72
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:10,165
Speaker 6:  About right. That's fair.

73
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:13,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Let's start with products. Yeah. Let's start with hardware. There's

74
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:16,965
Speaker 4:  new MacBook air in this world, which Apple just sort of snuck out into the

75
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:18,525
Speaker 4:  world. David, what's going on?

76
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah, so we've been kind of expecting Apple to announce

77
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:26,605
Speaker 5:  it was gonna have a spring event. Normally in March, not every

78
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:29,925
Speaker 5:  year but many years, it'll do a thing where it launches

79
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:34,285
Speaker 5:  usually new iPads and then a smorgasbord of other

80
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:36,485
Speaker 5:  stuff depending on what they're doing. But usually iPads are the center.

81
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:40,645
Speaker 5:  It seems like this year we're not gonna get that and instead we're gonna

82
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:44,045
Speaker 5:  get a parade of press releases and the first one that came out is

83
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:48,245
Speaker 5:  two new MacBook errors. There's the new 13 inch and the new

84
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:52,085
Speaker 5:  15 inch. They have M three chips. They're basically

85
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:56,005
Speaker 5:  just spec bumps. Right. Little faster. There was a mention of six G in

86
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:59,845
Speaker 5:  the press release, which I find personally infuriating. There

87
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:03,285
Speaker 5:  was lots of noise about them being good for ai, which I think is essentially

88
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:06,125
Speaker 5:  just a way to say like, these have pretty fast processors and no one else

89
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,125
Speaker 5:  knows what that means. No.

90
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:11,085
Speaker 4:  I wanna spend maybe an hour on the one paragraph where Apple said these are

91
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:12,965
Speaker 4:  the best consumer laptops for ai.

92
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:13,725
Speaker 6:  The best

93
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:15,885
Speaker 5:  Utterly meaningless sentence.

94
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:19,845
Speaker 4:  It will not be this hour in this second, not starting now, but

95
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:23,605
Speaker 4:  later in this episode, we're gonna take that apart word by word.

96
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:27,685
Speaker 5:  Okay. I'm excited about that. So yeah, it, these new ones, they

97
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:30,405
Speaker 5:  support dual displays for the first time, which people are excited about

98
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:30,965
Speaker 5:  if the

99
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:31,885
Speaker 4:  Lid is closed. Yeah.

100
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:34,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah's, it's really, it's really something. I

101
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,565
Speaker 4:  Feel like my job on this section of the podcast is to copy out everything

102
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:38,365
Speaker 4:  David is saying.

103
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:40,805
Speaker 4:  I'm sorry.

104
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:43,925
Speaker 5:  No, that's okay. We got a real, like you finish his, we finish each other's

105
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:45,085
Speaker 5:  sentences, vibe going on right now,

106
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:47,365
Speaker 4:  But it at the end of the sentence is real mad.

107
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:49,085
Speaker 5:  Right?

108
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:51,845
Speaker 4:  Like here's a fact, here's an angrier fact.

109
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:57,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I love this. For us, they also killed the wedge. The

110
00:06:57,645 --> 00:07:00,605
Speaker 5:  M1 MacBook error is no longer being sold, which is the end of that design.

111
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:03,765
Speaker 5:  All that's left is the M two and the M three. I have a lot of feelings about

112
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:07,165
Speaker 5:  that, but basically it's like new MacBook errors. They're a little better.

113
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:10,965
Speaker 5:  They're a little less expensive. Here you go. I can see why If you

114
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:13,565
Speaker 5:  Apple, you don't have an event for this. They're just like, remember The,

115
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:16,565
Speaker 5:  MacBook, Air. This is The MacBook Air now. And you're like, all right, they've

116
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:17,005
Speaker 5:  MacBook

117
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:19,285
Speaker 6:  Air. Well they've been kind of doing that a little bit, right? Like sometimes

118
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:22,565
Speaker 6:  they're just like, we got, it's a spec bump. You don, you don't need me.

119
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:25,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah, you don't need like Tim Cook to dance for this. Just enjoy your spec

120
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:26,045
Speaker 6:  bump. No,

121
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,965
Speaker 5:  I'm not mad at it. These look like great laptops like it. It is

122
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:34,005
Speaker 5:  the The MacBook Air is just so thoroughly the best

123
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:38,125
Speaker 5:  thousand dollar PC on the planet right now that I feel like Apple is just

124
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,205
Speaker 5:  like, you get it

125
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:41,245
Speaker 5:  here. It's

126
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:45,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. you know when they announced these MacBook errors there, there was

127
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,885
Speaker 4:  an event and they kind of didn't have a lot to say like the last event. That's

128
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,725
Speaker 4:  true. With MacBooks at it. They were like, it's 15 inches.

129
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:53,365
Speaker 4:  you know,

130
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:59,125
Speaker 6:  Tim Cook just held the camera, just stared it down. It was like,

131
00:07:59,125 --> 00:07:59,725
Speaker 6:  yeah, that's it.

132
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We had a whole conversation about the feet on The MacBook Air in the

133
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:06,245
Speaker 5:  eye. Do you remember that? Because that was the only thing to talk about.

134
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:08,045
Speaker 5:  It's like, look, there's little feet.

135
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:11,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah, they did like a demo of pages. Like for real, they did a demo like,

136
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:16,045
Speaker 4:  you know, and they're like the, it's because the screen is larger. You can

137
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:20,005
Speaker 4:  make the windows bigger. This was a real thing that happened. Natalie, I'm

138
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:23,245
Speaker 4:  not making this up even a little bit. That's real So I. Get what you're saying

139
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:27,165
Speaker 4:  when you say that they're, they've run out of things to say, but when

140
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:31,045
Speaker 4:  they spec bumped Intel MacBooks, they just spec bumped

141
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:34,315
Speaker 4:  them, which is fascinating, right? They're like, well here's some new Intel

142
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:37,635
Speaker 4:  processors. We didn't want to use 'em, but we have to until we figure out

143
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:40,955
Speaker 4:  how to shove an iPhone processor into here. But here they are. It's a core,

144
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:44,795
Speaker 4:  whatever Intel says this is called this year, right? Yeah. And

145
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:48,915
Speaker 4:  they would sometimes do a press release. They sometimes wouldn't. I feel

146
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:51,715
Speaker 4:  like they've hit that point with the M three, but because they make the M

147
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:55,685
Speaker 4:  three and they're very proud of it, they have to act like it's bigger

148
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:56,445
Speaker 4:  than it's Well

149
00:08:56,445 --> 00:09:00,405
Speaker 6:  It's, it's the best processor for ai so they have to promote it.

150
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:00,805
Speaker 5:  Wait,

151
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:04,285
Speaker 4:  Right? Yes. That's like exactly what I mean. It's like

152
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:08,525
Speaker 4:  they have to make up some stuff. Yeah. And the world's best

153
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:12,565
Speaker 4:  consumer laptop for AI is a wild

154
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:16,445
Speaker 4:  thing to say. Yep. I agree. They're probably very good

155
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:20,525
Speaker 4:  at some AI related tasks. They have a list M three includes a

156
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:24,485
Speaker 4:  faster and more efficient 16 core neural engine along with accelerators and

157
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:28,205
Speaker 4:  CPU and GPU to boost on-device machine learning, leveraging this incredible

158
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:31,965
Speaker 4:  AI performance, blah blah blah blah blah. Here's some stuff you can do. You

159
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:35,685
Speaker 4:  can check your homework with AI math assistance in Good note six.

160
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:39,485
Speaker 4:  I love it. If you're doing your math homework in good note six,

161
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:44,005
Speaker 4:  I'm guessing you don't need AI like computers

162
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:45,845
Speaker 4:  historically great at math,

163
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:48,285
Speaker 4:  real problem.

164
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:53,445
Speaker 4:  Like I'm just wondering about that. Okay. You can automatically enhance photos

165
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:55,885
Speaker 4:  and pixel later probe. That's great. I've talked about how much I like using

166
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:58,085
Speaker 4:  the enhanced features in Lightroom. If those are faster in the in three,

167
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:01,925
Speaker 4:  that's great. We're moving background noise from video using Cap Cut. Who

168
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:05,245
Speaker 4:  on earth is using Cap Cut on a MacBook?

169
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:08,285
Speaker 5:  I literally didn't know that was a thing you could do. If I'm being completely

170
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:09,125
Speaker 5:  honest. You

171
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:13,005
Speaker 4:  See what I'm saying? I'm pretty sure that's the iOS cap cut

172
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:16,725
Speaker 5:  App. Yeah. That you just use on your Mac. I don't, it's it's kind of a good

173
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:20,685
Speaker 5:  idea. I can sort of see it. It's a good app. I just, how do you not read

174
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:24,365
Speaker 5:  all of this as Apple? Just being like, our things are very fast. Do you like

175
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:26,645
Speaker 5:  to do fast things Come do fast things,

176
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:30,765
Speaker 4:  But that's what you do every time. Yeah. Try. Okay. So, I'm looking at Cap

177
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:34,645
Speaker 4:  cut, try out the Cap cut desktop version. It's the iPad version of Cap

178
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:34,885
Speaker 4:  Cut.

179
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,445
Speaker 5:  Perfect. Great,

180
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:39,885
Speaker 4:  Great. Beautiful Prove. But I to like, that's not

181
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:41,245
Speaker 4:  a lot

182
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:46,845
Speaker 4:  say like it's very cool that Apple has these trips and that

183
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:51,525
Speaker 4:  by Dance Ships a video editor that makes use of the tools, but

184
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:55,165
Speaker 4:  that is downstream of the fact that they make TikTok on the iPhone

185
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:59,495
Speaker 4:  because If, you people don't know Cap Cut is the TikTok video editor broken

186
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:03,415
Speaker 4:  out and made into an app. And by the way, If, you can figure it out. You're

187
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,095
Speaker 4:  a genius. You don't need ai 'cause the TikTok video editor in

188
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:08,255
Speaker 4:  are very confusing.

189
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:13,935
Speaker 4:  Not to say people don't figure them out teens. The teens are brilliant. It's

190
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:17,455
Speaker 4:  just fast. Things are fast is wild. Then you get down to what people actually

191
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:21,215
Speaker 4:  think of ai, which is MacBook Air can run optimized

192
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:25,055
Speaker 4:  AI models including large language models and diffusion models

193
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:28,855
Speaker 4:  for image generation locally with great performance. Mm. And it's like,

194
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:32,615
Speaker 4:  I'm also sure that is true. Yeah. I am also a hundred percent

195
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,335
Speaker 4:  sure that Mark Zuckerberg is out here being like, I've bought more Nvidia

196
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:40,095
Speaker 4:  H one hundreds than anyone else in history. Developers should come here because

197
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:41,055
Speaker 4:  I have them all.

198
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:41,415
Speaker 5:  Yep.

199
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:45,255
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And that there's a huge split in

200
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:49,495
Speaker 4:  where AI is being deployed and built and you

201
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:53,205
Speaker 4:  can run it on an M three MacBook error. And I, I think

202
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:54,005
Speaker 4:  Apple's just trying to,

203
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:57,245
Speaker 6:  Apple's not the only one that did this though, right? Because like both Lenovo,

204
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:01,525
Speaker 6:  hp, everybody at CES was like, look at our new laptops. They're

205
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:05,085
Speaker 6:  the best at running AI stuff. And you're like, what? AI stuff. And they're

206
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:08,125
Speaker 6:  like AI stuff the best.

207
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:12,165
Speaker 4:  Can I just offer you one more sentence from this re release?

208
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,525
Speaker 5:  This is the best one. I can't believe it took you this long to get to this.

209
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:18,685
Speaker 4:  It's, it's been a slow build and I Alex thank you for the AlleyOOP here.

210
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:22,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Because this here I'm for you here. This was the thing that ended all

211
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,965
Speaker 4:  of the Windows laptops when they're like, you know, like Microsoft

212
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,965
Speaker 4:  copilot because what Apple has written in its press release is in

213
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:33,965
Speaker 4:  addition to on-device performance, MacBook air supports

214
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:37,885
Speaker 4:  cloud-based solutions enabling users to run powerful

215
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:41,605
Speaker 4:  productivity and creative apps that tap into the power of Microsoft ai

216
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:45,485
Speaker 4:  such as Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 Canva and

217
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:46,445
Speaker 4:  Adobe Firefly.

218
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:49,645
Speaker 5:  Can I translate that sentence for you just very quickly? Yeah, please. Yes.

219
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:51,445
Speaker 5:  The MacBook Air has wifi,

220
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:56,885
Speaker 5:  we get it. Everybody

221
00:12:57,395 --> 00:13:01,205
Speaker 4:  Like, you know, it's a press internet, like whatever

222
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:04,445
Speaker 4:  you need to put some words in a press release. I'm not, you know, don't over

223
00:13:04,445 --> 00:13:08,285
Speaker 4:  index on this. It's hilarious. But it's kind of like we are

224
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:11,965
Speaker 4:  just outta things to say, we're like we made the best laptop. I don't know

225
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:14,325
Speaker 4:  Chad, GPT say some shit about ai.

226
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,365
Speaker 5:  It's really the funniest set of problems to have because ordinarily, right,

227
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:22,005
Speaker 5:  they'd be like, okay, here are the list of things that it does that are

228
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:24,485
Speaker 5:  substantially faster. And this personally says a little bit of that. It's

229
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:28,445
Speaker 5:  like it Excel spreadsheets are up to 35% faster, which is a

230
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:31,005
Speaker 5:  completely meaningless statistic about anything. It's

231
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:31,365
Speaker 4:  Very good

232
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:35,325
Speaker 5:  Video editing's a little faster. But it's like this whole thing is

233
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:39,085
Speaker 5:  just a lot of words to say this laptop rules,

234
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:42,205
Speaker 5:  it already does everything you wanted it to. It's done everything you wanted

235
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:44,725
Speaker 5:  it to for two generations now. Yeah,

236
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:45,525
Speaker 4:  It's

237
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,205
Speaker 5:  Gonna be fine. Just buy this laptop.

238
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:50,285
Speaker 4:  What do you want A 16 inch screen, right? Like one

239
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:53,445
Speaker 5:  Decade. Remember when we fixed the battery and now that's not a thing you

240
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:56,525
Speaker 5:  worry about in your laptop. You're welcome for that again. Yeah, that's still

241
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:56,725
Speaker 5:  here.

242
00:13:57,115 --> 00:14:00,645
Speaker 4:  Okay. I'll call it the two things. One, they call out the headphone track,

243
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:04,565
Speaker 4:  which is a personal victory for NELI lap Patel. You can't

244
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:07,685
Speaker 4:  you, you can't take it off this computer. Nope. It's a disaster. And you

245
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:10,405
Speaker 4:  know it, you know it in your heart. You shouldn't have taken it off the phone.

246
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:13,885
Speaker 4:  Especially now that the phones are huge and you gotta deal with it. Second,

247
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:18,285
Speaker 4:  the two external displays with the lid closed is, what are we doing

248
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:22,965
Speaker 4:  that by the way, that're closing the lid applies that all the old ones,

249
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,885
Speaker 4:  all the old ones can support two displays with, right? 'cause you got the

250
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:30,085
Speaker 4:  lid up and another display.

251
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:32,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's still just two displays. It's just

252
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:36,485
Speaker 4:  Two displays. You should let all those people have two displays with the

253
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:40,325
Speaker 4:  lid closed. You gonna force an upgrade to an M three so they

254
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:42,725
Speaker 4:  can run Canva in a web browser.

255
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:43,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

256
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:47,725
Speaker 5:  We've made a gigantic performance breakthrough. The display can be over

257
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:50,765
Speaker 5:  there now. We've done it everybody.

258
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:55,285
Speaker 4:  It's a lot. What's interesting about this is, you know,

259
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:58,685
Speaker 4:  it comes on sort of the heels of a report, I believe from Mark Germond at

260
00:14:58,685 --> 00:15:02,645
Speaker 4:  Bloomberg saying they're gonna roll out a bunch of stuff over the

261
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:05,405
Speaker 4:  next few weeks. So we were expecting the MacBook error.

262
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:10,405
Speaker 4:  iOS 17.4 is out, that's the DMA compliance release. We'll

263
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:14,205
Speaker 4:  get to that in a minute. But that is support supposed to support new iPads

264
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:18,025
Speaker 4:  as well. If in days past a

265
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:21,945
Speaker 4:  new MacBook, some new iPads, some other new products or whatever that is

266
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:25,705
Speaker 4:  an Apple event. And I think now the pressure is on them to be like it's a

267
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:29,665
Speaker 4:  vision pro. It's the next iPhone and

268
00:15:29,785 --> 00:15:33,185
Speaker 4:  I, I wonder if they've just sort of gotten themselves

269
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:36,865
Speaker 4:  miscalibrated on what people actually care about, which is like new products

270
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:39,675
Speaker 4:  they will use and buy, buy and use. Yeah,

271
00:15:39,675 --> 00:15:43,475
Speaker 5:  I mean this is like the most mainstream product Apple makes in this,

272
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:47,915
Speaker 5:  in this like category, right? So if ever you were going to be like,

273
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:51,235
Speaker 5:  here's a thing that many, many, many, many people want and are going to buy.

274
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,595
Speaker 5:  This is the one. but it does make for a deeply uninteresting event.

275
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:59,355
Speaker 5:  Like I, I feel for whoever would have to stand there and make a long speech

276
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:02,035
Speaker 5:  about how the M three chip is gonna change your life. Yeah. but

277
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:05,755
Speaker 6:  It could have been the thing after an iPad with Pro, with an

278
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:08,915
Speaker 6:  OLED display and you're like, look at the iPad Pro with the OLED display

279
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,955
Speaker 6:  and here's some iPad airs. Those are cool. And then one last thing,

280
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,635
Speaker 6:  MacBook Airs got an M three in 'em now. Great. And we're done. Like

281
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:19,955
Speaker 6:  that would've been a nice, nice event. I would've enjoyed watching that while

282
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:21,795
Speaker 6:  you guys fly out to it. It would've been good times.

283
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,075
Speaker 4:  This is the other problem. They have to, they have to make infomercials now

284
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:28,835
Speaker 4:  for all their events. Yeah. Yep. And I bet the infomercial team is like,

285
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:30,035
Speaker 4:  we don't, we don't know what to do here.

286
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:32,075
Speaker 6:  We, it's five minutes long

287
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,115
Speaker 4:  Old MacBook air. It's too hard to hold. Like

288
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:40,595
Speaker 4:  what are you gonna do? Like someone using a Windows laptop, it explodes into

289
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:44,515
Speaker 4:  flames. You're like, whereas when you actually had in-person events, you

290
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:48,395
Speaker 4:  could talk about the computer. Yeah. By the way David, I, I

291
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:51,515
Speaker 4:  just looked at the, it's 35% faster at Excel

292
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,715
Speaker 4:  and there's a foot, there's a footnote and the footnote is testing was conducted

293
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,555
Speaker 4:  by Apple in January, 2024. See apple.com/ MacBook dash air

294
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:04,435
Speaker 4:  for more information. Which means Apple just did some tests.

295
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:05,635
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah.

296
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:08,315
Speaker 5:  Literally opened one spreadsheet and said that we did it.

297
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:12,635
Speaker 4:  Very unclear what those tests are and then you go to that webpage and the

298
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:14,795
Speaker 4:  It does not, it does not tell you what the tests were.

299
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:16,355
Speaker 5:  That's very strange.

300
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:20,775
Speaker 4:  If anyone knows how to measure the performance of Excel,

301
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:23,735
Speaker 4:  let us know. I'm sure you can. I'm I'm sure that

302
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:24,935
Speaker 6:  No, I used Tom

303
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:29,015
Speaker 4:  Microsoft team. But is there a standard Excel speed test for

304
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:29,895
Speaker 4:  computers? No,

305
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:34,015
Speaker 6:  No. We would make, we made one a place. I worked, we we had one and

306
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:37,935
Speaker 6:  it had like 50,000 names on it and then you'd have to press a button

307
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:41,495
Speaker 6:  and it would process all the names and you'd time it. Oh that's fun.

308
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:45,575
Speaker 6:  And it was, it was a fun test. I mean it was really obnoxious to do

309
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:49,165
Speaker 6:  but it was, it was kind of cool. And then all of them got to be about the

310
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:53,005
Speaker 6:  same speed, which was real fast and it was no longer a useful

311
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,525
Speaker 6:  test. So I guess we'll go make a fun

312
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:58,165
Speaker 6:  Excel spreadsheet again. You

313
00:17:58,165 --> 00:18:01,485
Speaker 5:  Bring up an interesting point with that actually, which is that like with

314
00:18:01,485 --> 00:18:05,045
Speaker 5:  the AI stuff, the idea of this

315
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:09,285
Speaker 5:  benchmarking kind of tool might actually be interesting again. Yeah, like

316
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:13,125
Speaker 5:  one thing I think about a lot is the only AI thing I do on my

317
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:17,365
Speaker 5:  specific computer locally is transcriptions. I have this app

318
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:21,125
Speaker 5:  called Mac Whisper that I use. I just feed in

319
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:24,965
Speaker 5:  an audio file that from an interview or a YouTube video I need quotes from

320
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:28,605
Speaker 5:  or whatever. And it just transcribes it using Whisper

321
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:32,365
Speaker 5:  from OpenAI and it runs locally on the device. It's pretty fast.

322
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:36,925
Speaker 5:  but it has this really fascinating, you can either download the small

323
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:40,445
Speaker 5:  crappy version of it that's really fast or the huge really good version of

324
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:43,685
Speaker 5:  it that's super slow. And and for me the idea of being able to like

325
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:47,885
Speaker 5:  cut in half the time it would take me to do the very good one is like a

326
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:51,405
Speaker 5:  meaningful thing in a way that a faster processor has not been meaningful

327
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:55,325
Speaker 5:  to me in a very long time. So I think with the image stuff and

328
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:59,285
Speaker 5:  with that kind of stuff, like local AI is going to mean something

329
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:03,005
Speaker 5:  and speed of that is going to mean something. I just think for most people

330
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:06,885
Speaker 5:  we're like a generation or two of devices away from that. And at

331
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:10,855
Speaker 5:  least for now, basically everything is gonna keep happening in the

332
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:14,535
Speaker 5:  cloud. So like the most AI forward thing Apple did in this moment is

333
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:18,415
Speaker 5:  wifi. But like someday I think this will be real. So like the

334
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:22,055
Speaker 5:  idea that we can be an AI focused laptop, I think is a thing

335
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:23,975
Speaker 5:  just not yet for most people.

336
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:27,815
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. And the questions is like what do you want to benchmark in that

337
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:31,695
Speaker 4:  case? Is it image generation? Is it AI transcription? Is

338
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:35,585
Speaker 4:  it text generation? Is it Yeah. Make

339
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:38,785
Speaker 4:  a image of Hitler that's so not racist. It becomes racist again.

340
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:42,065
Speaker 5:  It's probably not that one. If I had to,

341
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:45,705
Speaker 4:  Probably not. I'm guessing that will not be a, a released benchmark,

342
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:50,105
Speaker 4:  but if someone wants to do it. Sure. So that's

343
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,905
Speaker 4:  that. I wanna talk about the iPads, but before we do that, I feel like we

344
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:56,545
Speaker 4:  should give Alex a moment to just mourn the passing of the

345
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:57,585
Speaker 4:  Wedge MacBook Air.

346
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:58,665
Speaker 5:  I'm bummed

347
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:01,585
Speaker 4:  Alex. I know you quite a lot of feelings about this. Yeah,

348
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:04,705
Speaker 6:  I had feelings and then I made Victoria write the feelings because I'm in

349
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:04,905
Speaker 6:  Texas.

350
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:08,145
Speaker 4:  The power of being had the feelings too. Being the

351
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:11,185
Speaker 6:  Editor. Yeah. The power of being the editor. Well no, we both had the same

352
00:20:11,185 --> 00:20:14,985
Speaker 6:  feelings, which was like, the wedge was cool and it packed a bigger battery

353
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:18,385
Speaker 6:  too. Remember like the battery life was really, really good on that in one

354
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:22,345
Speaker 6:  MacBook Air. And I, I missed that and it was just like,

355
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:25,945
Speaker 6:  it had an identity. And now The MacBook Air kind of

356
00:20:25,945 --> 00:20:29,895
Speaker 6:  doesn't, like, there's not a big difference between it and

357
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,495
Speaker 6:  the MacBook Pro physically

358
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:33,325
Speaker 6:  at

359
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:34,445
Speaker 4:  All. Or any laptop.

360
00:20:34,595 --> 00:20:38,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's, it's just like, okay now it's just a really good laptop and that's

361
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,805
Speaker 6:  cool, but before it was like, it's a really good laptop that's a little like

362
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:44,725
Speaker 6:  wedge shaped. And four of us noticed that. But us four really cared

363
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:46,605
Speaker 6:  about it and we were really passionate

364
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:49,365
Speaker 4:  About it. It remember the first MacBook error, Steve Jobs pulled it outta

365
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:52,805
Speaker 4:  the manila envelope, which was a big deal to be like, look at how small our

366
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:53,325
Speaker 4:  computer is.

367
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:55,045
Speaker 5:  One of the great reveals still

368
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:59,125
Speaker 4:  So good. one of the great reveals, I encourage you to all

369
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:02,925
Speaker 4:  go back and look at photos and reviews of that first MacBook Air. It was

370
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:06,845
Speaker 4:  Garbage, which was such a deeply compromised device. They built it

371
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:10,645
Speaker 4:  around a custom Intel processor that Intel didn't know what to do with because

372
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:14,565
Speaker 4:  it was so underpowered. And they're like, and Apple and Steve

373
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,645
Speaker 4:  Jobs and Johnny AV were like, what if Tiny Computer,

374
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:22,125
Speaker 4:  the ports were on a flat down door on the side. Oh yeah. This thing was weird.

375
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,605
Speaker 4:  It was like a different design language entirely. It was very, it was like

376
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,485
Speaker 4:  Bulbus, the second generation MacBook Care, the iconic

377
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:33,245
Speaker 4:  wedge shape came later when they had done the

378
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:36,285
Speaker 4:  iPhone and some other things and they, they were like, what do we bring back

379
00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:40,125
Speaker 4:  to the Mac? And the thing they wanted to bring back the most was instant

380
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:43,605
Speaker 4:  on when you open the lid. Because Mac didn't used to wake up right away.

381
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:48,305
Speaker 4:  They, they were computers. They would like, they would like emit steam and

382
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:51,505
Speaker 4:  like make warring sounds. So the main thing they wanted was when you open

383
00:21:51,505 --> 00:21:53,705
Speaker 4:  the lid, it would be ready to go like an iPhone. It would be ready to go

384
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:56,025
Speaker 4:  when you hit the wake button and they had to build all this stuff. And that

385
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:59,025
Speaker 4:  was like the moment The MacBook Air became the MacBook carrier. You had the

386
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:02,905
Speaker 4:  wedge shape, it was still really small. Alex the battery thing was a real

387
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:05,825
Speaker 4:  big deal back then. They Yep. They built these, I think they called them

388
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:09,425
Speaker 4:  terrorist batteries. It was a whole deal. It was a whole thing. Like there's

389
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:12,145
Speaker 4:  a Johnny I video, he's like, the batteries are in steps, like a terrace,

390
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:16,105
Speaker 4:  like a thing. Oh yeah, you can go watch it. All that is

391
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:19,105
Speaker 4:  amazing. Wal Mossberg famously

392
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,785
Speaker 4:  bought like five MacBook errors to like have in his house

393
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:25,985
Speaker 4:  because he didn't wanna use any other laptop and he was afraid they were

394
00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:29,905
Speaker 4:  gonna discontinue them in that weird period where Apple like stopped

395
00:22:29,905 --> 00:22:30,785
Speaker 4:  caring about the Mac,

396
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:34,345
Speaker 5:  It was the butterfly keyboard era is what it was like that was the moment

397
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:37,865
Speaker 5:  that it was like, oh, maybe these are just going to get worse again. And

398
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:39,665
Speaker 5:  then they stopped and they got better again

399
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:44,305
Speaker 4:  Because people realized that Max were infinitely more capable than iPads.

400
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:47,025
Speaker 5:  Yeah. What if we just like made computers that were good and people wanted

401
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:49,305
Speaker 5:  to use what a, what a meeting that must have been.

402
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:55,025
Speaker 5:  But I think, I mean to me, like I, I've been trying to think about how I

403
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:58,025
Speaker 5:  feel about the Wedge 'cause the comments on V'S piece are very funny 'cause

404
00:22:58,025 --> 00:23:01,585
Speaker 5:  it's a bunch of people being like, oh, The Verge. You yell at people for

405
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:05,225
Speaker 5:  not redesigning their stuff every two years and then you yell at them when

406
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:08,785
Speaker 5:  they redesign their stuff every two years for getting rid of their iconic

407
00:23:08,785 --> 00:23:12,745
Speaker 5:  designs. And I think there's maybe something to that, but I

408
00:23:12,745 --> 00:23:16,665
Speaker 5:  also feel like the wedge was legitimately

409
00:23:16,665 --> 00:23:20,305
Speaker 5:  like an iconic piece of laptop design. Yeah. Yep. And

410
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:24,465
Speaker 5:  also it was better. Like I, I, I cannot

411
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:28,225
Speaker 5:  prove it, but I sincerely believe that typing on that like very slight incline

412
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:32,145
Speaker 5:  with your hands felt better than the flat thing that I'm kind of

413
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:35,985
Speaker 5:  perching on top of. On other MacBooks. It's why I liked the air over the

414
00:23:35,985 --> 00:23:39,665
Speaker 5:  pro that like it's thinner, it's lighter, but also it, it

415
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:43,745
Speaker 5:  felt a little better to just have my hands on. Yeah. And maybe I just like

416
00:23:43,745 --> 00:23:47,245
Speaker 5:  need to get used to that. I still mostly use an M1 air all the time and I

417
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:51,005
Speaker 5:  love it to pieces. And I will say one of the truly wild things for me

418
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:54,845
Speaker 5:  as a tech lover is now I am two full

419
00:23:54,995 --> 00:23:57,965
Speaker 5:  revs of this device out of date and still have no

420
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:01,685
Speaker 5:  compulsion to upgrade. Like I just don't need this computer. My M1 air is

421
00:24:01,695 --> 00:24:05,085
Speaker 5:  still good and is going to be for a long time. Yeah. Which is a crazy place

422
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:08,845
Speaker 5:  for Apple to be, but it is also like as a laptop user kind of amazing.

423
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:11,685
Speaker 4:  We got a bunch of notes last week after we talked about Apple making and

424
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:14,685
Speaker 4:  TV and like why they didn't make a tv because the upgrade cycles are too

425
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:18,365
Speaker 4:  long and now the upgrade cycles are too long. And people were like, this

426
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:21,365
Speaker 4:  is the weirdest I've ever felt. I don't need a new anything. Yep. Yeah. And

427
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:25,245
Speaker 4:  that is a wild place for any of these companies to be in. Like

428
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:28,245
Speaker 4:  you just don't need a new one. They all kind of do the things and everyone's

429
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:31,685
Speaker 4:  chasing whatever shiny object that you think will be The future. But

430
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:36,125
Speaker 4:  at the point where you're like, well it runs Chrome and using Chrome I can

431
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:39,925
Speaker 4:  access cutting edge AI system for sake better than ever before.

432
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,565
Speaker 4:  You're kind of at a, you're kind of at a place where you gotta figure out

433
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,485
Speaker 4:  what the next thing a laptop is gonna do. The thing that gets me about the

434
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,205
Speaker 4:  wed shape in particular. And Alex, I'm very curious for your read on this.

435
00:24:51,215 --> 00:24:54,805
Speaker 4:  Apple tried to kill The MacBook Air a lot. Yes. Like

436
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:58,725
Speaker 4:  they tried really hard. They didn't update it to Retina for years.

437
00:24:59,115 --> 00:25:02,725
Speaker 4:  They just left this thing alone and they tried to push everyone towards that,

438
00:25:03,155 --> 00:25:07,005
Speaker 4:  that weird middle 13 inch MacBook

439
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:11,005
Speaker 4:  Pro that they made that Yeah. Like obviously wasn't a MacBook Pro. Like

440
00:25:11,065 --> 00:25:13,845
Speaker 4:  the real MacBook Pro had four ports and this one only had two. And it was

441
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,125
Speaker 4:  like you just made a MacBook error and put it in a case of the retina display

442
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:21,005
Speaker 4:  and called it a MacBook Pro. Phil Siller stood on a stage one

443
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:24,925
Speaker 4:  year and did like volumetric analysis of The

444
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:28,765
Speaker 4:  MacBook Air in the MacBook Pro and was like, this one is actually smaller,

445
00:25:29,425 --> 00:25:32,525
Speaker 4:  why won't you buy this one? And everyone's like, I don't know. I like the

446
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:36,405
Speaker 4:  web shape. And they kept selling them until they, they, they were

447
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:40,405
Speaker 4:  effectively forced to un kill it. Like their

448
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:44,165
Speaker 4:  answer to us, to other people who asked was like, people just keep buying

449
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:47,725
Speaker 4:  this computer. Like we have to just keep making it. Like what do you want

450
00:25:47,725 --> 00:25:50,125
Speaker 4:  us to do? So they updated it, they revved it, they put the retina screen

451
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:54,085
Speaker 4:  in it. They eventually put the M1 in it. And now I think Alex

452
00:25:54,195 --> 00:25:58,165
Speaker 4:  what they did was they just made that 13 inch MacBook Pro.

453
00:25:58,505 --> 00:26:02,485
Speaker 4:  Yes. And they just called it a MacBook Air. Yes. And that's what that

454
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:04,285
Speaker 4:  that's the thing you're reacting to. Yeah,

455
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:04,445
Speaker 6:  No,

456
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:05,805
Speaker 4:  That, that's The MacBook Air was a design.

457
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:09,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They, they, they had something that was like really thoughtfully designed

458
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:13,205
Speaker 6:  and stood out and people said, yes, this is a thing I want

459
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:17,125
Speaker 6:  to own in my house and if I'm Walt Mossberg I wanna own five

460
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:20,525
Speaker 6:  of them. And, and then they said, okay, what if we just took the MacBook

461
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:24,045
Speaker 6:  Pro, which is very, very good. I'm, I'm currently podcasting from one.

462
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:28,165
Speaker 6:  Love it. And we just made it a little lighter and cheaper

463
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:34,035
Speaker 6:  and we called it an error. That's not the same

464
00:26:34,085 --> 00:26:37,635
Speaker 6:  thing. I mean technically it is, it is the new MacBook air, but it's,

465
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:41,675
Speaker 6:  it's not quite the same. Like this was a thing that was so

466
00:26:41,705 --> 00:26:45,205
Speaker 6:  well designed. You just wanted to have one. Even if even the underpowered

467
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:48,205
Speaker 6:  versions of it, you still wanted to have it, even when it had a garbage display,

468
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:52,485
Speaker 6:  you still wanted it because it was just, it worked. It like the design, everything

469
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,445
Speaker 6:  came together just right and then they said, nah.

470
00:26:56,035 --> 00:26:57,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's all over. And

471
00:26:57,205 --> 00:27:00,965
Speaker 6:  It feels like they're, they're focused more on, on the guts than they are

472
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:04,405
Speaker 6:  on the outside design, which is fine. Like they've spent a long time only

473
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:08,285
Speaker 6:  focused on the outside design and not the guts. So it's, it's good that they're

474
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:11,685
Speaker 6:  thinking about the guts, but I would like a, a balance of design and

475
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:15,285
Speaker 6:  thinking about really smart guts for your cool laptop.

476
00:27:15,705 --> 00:27:16,125
Speaker 6:  That'd

477
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,445
Speaker 4:  Be nice. You want, do you want them to be beautiful on the inside and the

478
00:27:18,445 --> 00:27:20,445
Speaker 4:  outside? Yeah. The dream.

479
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:21,365
Speaker 6:  The dream.

480
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:26,165
Speaker 5:  I think part of it also is that like, I think the thing that Apple may have

481
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:29,725
Speaker 5:  underestimated for a while is how good The

482
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:33,685
Speaker 5:  MacBook Air brand is. Yes. Yes. Like I just think about Joanna

483
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:37,125
Speaker 5:  Stern spending a decade reviewing laptops and being like for

484
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:40,205
Speaker 5:  $200 more you can buy a MacBook error. Like it became a meme

485
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:44,965
Speaker 5:  that you, for $200 more you can just buy a MacBook error and that's the

486
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:48,845
Speaker 5:  right thing to do. Like I think that has a sort of

487
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,765
Speaker 5:  immediate reception in people's minds as like that's the best laptop

488
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:55,605
Speaker 5:  that is just If. you don't know which laptop to buy. Just buy a MacBook error

489
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:59,565
Speaker 5:  has been true for so long. Even when it wasn't true

490
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,805
Speaker 5:  and it wasn't true for a minute there because it did get weird and old, but

491
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:06,005
Speaker 5:  it was still like the default laptop. Yeah. And

492
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:10,245
Speaker 5:  I, to some extent, I think it's wild that Apple kind of tried to throw that

493
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:13,365
Speaker 5:  away and I think also thought that that was just a story about MacBooks.

494
00:28:13,665 --> 00:28:17,485
Speaker 5:  But I think it's not, I think it is a thing about The MacBook Air and

495
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:21,325
Speaker 5:  so and so now even when it is essentially just like a, a proin

496
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:24,925
Speaker 5:  in a very real way. Like the distinction between those two is just incredible

497
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:25,365
Speaker 4:  Branding.

498
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:29,005
Speaker 5:  David Minus You. I thought you'd like that the

499
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:32,845
Speaker 5:  MacBook Pro mini, I don't know, call it whatever you want, but it's

500
00:28:33,435 --> 00:28:36,925
Speaker 5:  like the heir name I think is actually really important and I think Apple

501
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:39,325
Speaker 5:  understands that in a way that it didn't for a while.

502
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,505
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. Lemme make the counter argument just for a second, but then we should

503
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:46,265
Speaker 4:  move on. Please. Apple's branding is hopelessly confused.

504
00:28:46,765 --> 00:28:50,625
Speaker 4:  Yes. And they are addicted to some words that have lost all

505
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:53,585
Speaker 4:  meaning but they don't know what other words to use.

506
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:58,915
Speaker 4:  True. I don't know so true what AirPods Pro are, I just don't What is

507
00:28:58,915 --> 00:29:02,195
Speaker 4:  professional at AirPods? Like unless you're using the Vision Pro, they're

508
00:29:02,195 --> 00:29:05,075
Speaker 4:  necessarily compressed audio and you shouldn't do anything professional with

509
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:08,315
Speaker 4:  them except appearing cable news from time to time.

510
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:16,195
Speaker 4:  Right. Like an iPad Pro is just an iPad

511
00:29:16,305 --> 00:29:18,155
Speaker 4:  with a nicer screen and more Ram.

512
00:29:18,945 --> 00:29:19,235
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

513
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:24,035
Speaker 4:  I know what a MacBook Pro is that's designed to run like

514
00:29:24,135 --> 00:29:27,995
Speaker 4:  pro applications. I know what a Mac Pro is. I,

515
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:31,235
Speaker 4:  you know, it's like we're all over the place. What is why, what is the Vision

516
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:34,975
Speaker 4:  Pro? What is the vision minus like

517
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:39,215
Speaker 4:  these, these words they, they just have these words that like signify something

518
00:29:39,215 --> 00:29:42,925
Speaker 4:  to their audience. I think you could get to a place where you have a

519
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:46,205
Speaker 4:  MacBook, remember they used to just have a regular old MacBook and then you

520
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:50,285
Speaker 4:  could have a MacBook Air which would be an ultra portable, like a

521
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:53,765
Speaker 4:  12 inch computer. That was really powerful. But I think the problem is consumers

522
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:57,005
Speaker 4:  have said very loudly what they would like is 13 to 15 inch laptops.

523
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:01,285
Speaker 4:  And so you have to take your best brand and put it in that box. And MacBook

524
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:02,525
Speaker 4:  Care is by four the best brand for that

525
00:30:02,525 --> 00:30:06,325
Speaker 5:  Box. Yeah. I think what Apple wants is to have a MacBook and a MacBook

526
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:09,925
Speaker 5:  Pro and Mac and Apple tried to do that for a while. It's just

527
00:30:10,115 --> 00:30:13,965
Speaker 5:  that it made the MacBook bad and made a bunch

528
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:17,685
Speaker 5:  of bad decisions about the MacBook and also spent several years

529
00:30:17,995 --> 00:30:21,685
Speaker 5:  sort of steadfastly ruining its entire computer lineup before fixing it.

530
00:30:21,825 --> 00:30:24,885
Speaker 5:  And but I think like 10 years ago, apple

531
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:29,045
Speaker 5:  wanted to have a MacBook and a MacBook Pro and so

532
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:32,125
Speaker 5:  badly botched the MacBook that I think it just had to go back to the MacBook

533
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,725
Speaker 5:  era. Like there was a minute they wanted that to be the one, they

534
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:37,605
Speaker 4:  Should just release that plaque plastic MacBook again. They

535
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:37,805
Speaker 5:  Should,

536
00:30:38,195 --> 00:30:41,845
Speaker 4:  That black plastic MacBook was a triumph of this one. It was. Alright, we

537
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:45,725
Speaker 4:  should move on from just naval gazing with The MacBook Air look

538
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:48,245
Speaker 4:  release a wed shaped computer and Alex will buy it. That's

539
00:30:48,485 --> 00:30:51,805
Speaker 5:  I I will say the fact that I cannot wait for our reviews because if they

540
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:55,925
Speaker 5:  actually got rid of the fingerprinting is on the midnight one. That might

541
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:59,805
Speaker 5:  be the thing that makes me actually kind of lust after an M three MacBook

542
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:03,005
Speaker 5:  air. 'cause the M two one looked great but then you touch it and it's gross

543
00:31:03,005 --> 00:31:05,605
Speaker 5:  forever and hopefully they fix that.

544
00:31:06,785 --> 00:31:09,485
Speaker 4:  So we are in different places because the other rumor is that they're going

545
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:13,445
Speaker 4:  to refresh the iPad lineup and actually make it make sense that

546
00:31:13,445 --> 00:31:16,285
Speaker 4:  they will have an iPad Pro and iPad Air and then the iPad Air and the iPad

547
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:17,205
Speaker 4:  Pro are pretty fuzzy right

548
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:20,245
Speaker 5:  Now. Have you seen the rumor that there's not gonna be a 12.9 inch iPad air?

549
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:23,725
Speaker 5:  Because that makes sense. Yeah. But what if we had more models? NELI, can

550
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:25,165
Speaker 5:  I interest you in more iPads?

551
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:30,845
Speaker 4:  Every now and again I'm reminded that Tim Cook is a supply chain expert,

552
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:35,525
Speaker 4:  you know and like he's like, what if I just flex on my ability to

553
00:31:35,525 --> 00:31:39,125
Speaker 4:  manage the complexity of the supply chain? That's what I got. You want

554
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:42,965
Speaker 4:  4,000 SKUs? I got you 8,000 come

555
00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:46,405
Speaker 4:  at me. I'm Tim Cook. I mean that's fine. You could just do it.

556
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:50,285
Speaker 4:  He's like, how many manufacturers and how many countries double it?

557
00:31:51,185 --> 00:31:54,845
Speaker 4:  Why are you still in the room? By the way, that's the most famous Tim Cook

558
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:56,565
Speaker 4:  story. I wanna, I think about all the time when he had the meeting about

559
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:58,725
Speaker 4:  some prom in China and then he looked at his executive and he is like, why

560
00:31:58,725 --> 00:32:00,125
Speaker 4:  are you still here? And the guy got up and flew

561
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,845
Speaker 5:  To China, didn't go home, didn't pack a bag, just went to China.

562
00:32:02,845 --> 00:32:06,685
Speaker 4:  Just went straight to China rules. Wow. Very good. And that's how you

563
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:09,965
Speaker 4:  get a 12.9 inch iPad air. He's like, what are you doing? This isn't enough

564
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:11,485
Speaker 4:  Excuse. Get outta here.

565
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:17,445
Speaker 4:  I don't, I don't know what his meetings are like at all. Is that You should

566
00:32:17,445 --> 00:32:20,205
Speaker 4:  come on de coder Tim, please tell me what actually goes on in your life.

567
00:32:22,395 --> 00:32:25,845
Speaker 4:  What I think is really interesting about the iPads is they're gonna put an

568
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:29,925
Speaker 4:  OLED screen in an iPad Pro and I do not need to upgrade my iPad Pro

569
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:33,885
Speaker 4:  and I will buy that product so fast. Yes, a hundred percent. Why?

570
00:32:34,155 --> 00:32:36,365
Speaker 4:  Because Ola, why, why am I gonna do that?

571
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:40,485
Speaker 5:  It's the same reason you have a stupid Sony tv. It's

572
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:40,805
Speaker 4:  The same

573
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:44,685
Speaker 5:  Reason like there there is just a subset of people in the world

574
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:49,285
Speaker 5:  headlined by one NELI Patel who If you just say the word ole,

575
00:32:49,285 --> 00:32:52,845
Speaker 5:  they will start just hawking money in your general direction. And when you

576
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:56,565
Speaker 5:  run out of ideas you just say Ole Now and

577
00:32:56,635 --> 00:32:57,365
Speaker 5:  NELI buys it.

578
00:32:57,785 --> 00:33:01,645
Speaker 4:  That's perfect by the way, can I just say Becky and I watched anyone

579
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:05,605
Speaker 4:  but you on Bravia core on the new Sony Ole And boy,

580
00:33:05,665 --> 00:33:09,005
Speaker 4:  if there's one movie that does not need to be stringed at 80 megabits per

581
00:33:09,005 --> 00:33:10,845
Speaker 4:  second, it is anything but you,

582
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:14,045
Speaker 4:  nothing in this movie is moving faster,

583
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:17,165
Speaker 5:  But that like doubles the amount of stuff that's on Bravia course. So that's

584
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:17,565
Speaker 5:  pretty exciting.

585
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:21,005
Speaker 4:  It's like they got one, they did it

586
00:33:22,425 --> 00:33:26,165
Speaker 4:  anyhow. I, I hope they can reconcile the iPad line a little bit

587
00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:30,045
Speaker 4:  with all of these changes and actually be like, okay, the pro has the nicest

588
00:33:30,045 --> 00:33:33,965
Speaker 4:  display. Yeah. Not yeah, the same display

589
00:33:33,965 --> 00:33:37,325
Speaker 4:  with a nicer backlight. We'll see none of this stuff is gonna get an event

590
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:41,085
Speaker 4:  so that we will have very little opportunity to ask questions

591
00:33:41,095 --> 00:33:44,045
Speaker 4:  about it. you know, like we're gonna get them and we'll review them and that

592
00:33:44,045 --> 00:33:47,165
Speaker 4:  will be that. But I think it's funny that Apple doesn't think adding up its

593
00:33:47,165 --> 00:33:50,905
Speaker 4:  biggest products and announcing them all at once, merits

594
00:33:51,385 --> 00:33:53,025
Speaker 4:  a moment anymore because

595
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:53,785
Speaker 6:  They're not phones.

596
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:57,765
Speaker 4:  They're in a place where they have to do really, really flashy things. I

597
00:33:57,925 --> 00:34:00,525
Speaker 4:  I I think they only do the phone 'cause people expect them to do the phone.

598
00:34:00,525 --> 00:34:04,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I honestly think with the way they're going right now, unless they

599
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:08,285
Speaker 4:  change the phone in some giant way that you know, if

600
00:34:08,285 --> 00:34:12,125
Speaker 4:  the next iPhone is a camera bump in a processor bump the argument

601
00:34:12,145 --> 00:34:15,205
Speaker 4:  to not do an event based on what they're doing here is right there. Yeah.

602
00:34:15,205 --> 00:34:17,805
Speaker 4:  But there's no way they can't do an iPhone event. Right. That's their moment

603
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,285
Speaker 4:  every year.

604
00:34:18,715 --> 00:34:21,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I do think we're, we're ramping up towards a pretty huge

605
00:34:22,825 --> 00:34:26,805
Speaker 5:  WW DC in June for a variety of reasons. All the AI stuff is rumored to be

606
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:30,205
Speaker 5:  coming then. And I think like If you want to see a sort of

607
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:34,245
Speaker 5:  software led hardware cycle coming. I think it probably starts at

608
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:35,045
Speaker 5:  wwe DC

609
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:38,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I agree with that. And I am very curious to see

610
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:42,965
Speaker 4:  the best consumer laptop for AI is a clear potential hint

611
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:46,605
Speaker 4:  towards the next version of Mac os and iOS will have some actual AI features

612
00:34:46,605 --> 00:34:50,565
Speaker 4:  in it besides whatever LLM they claim is powering

613
00:34:50,665 --> 00:34:54,005
Speaker 4:  the world's worst auto Correct in the iPhone keyboard. We should talk about

614
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:57,765
Speaker 4:  the, the Microsoft news 'cause right next to all of this is the service Pro

615
00:34:57,765 --> 00:34:59,805
Speaker 4:  10 service laptop six Alex, what's going on there?

616
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:03,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah, they, there's some confusion there. Tom, Tom was doing some

617
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:07,965
Speaker 6:  investigating and because we had one, we

618
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:11,965
Speaker 6:  had Zach Boden I believe say that we were gonna get a whole

619
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:15,525
Speaker 6:  new line of surfaces with OLEDs in them

620
00:35:15,525 --> 00:35:19,365
Speaker 6:  announced this month. It sounds like we are gonna get something announced

621
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:22,845
Speaker 6:  this month, but it's gonna be more for like commercial stuff

622
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:27,165
Speaker 6:  and then we'll get some consumer stuff later, including

623
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:30,885
Speaker 6:  some surfaces with OLEDs and arm

624
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:34,885
Speaker 6:  processors. But we're not really sure if the arm processors are gonna be

625
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:38,845
Speaker 6:  exclusive to the consumer ones or if we'll also get Intel in them.

626
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:43,085
Speaker 6:  So there's still things are up in the air, but we're gonna be getting some

627
00:35:43,085 --> 00:35:45,725
Speaker 6:  new surfaces this year. It sounds like we're gonna get a pretty big redesign

628
00:35:46,265 --> 00:35:50,245
Speaker 6:  on, on the Surface Pro and the Surface laptop for consumers, but

629
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:51,965
Speaker 6:  not necessarily the commercial version.

630
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:56,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah, and the fascinating thing here is that Panas Penne is no longer at

631
00:35:56,485 --> 00:36:00,285
Speaker 4:  Microsoft to run this stuff. So whether or not there's

632
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:04,275
Speaker 4:  a mission change for Surface or philosophy

633
00:36:04,275 --> 00:36:05,955
Speaker 4:  change for Surface I think is kind of up

634
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:09,035
Speaker 5:  In date, but we won't see it this time. I think like just the, the product

635
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:12,755
Speaker 5:  rev cycles are so long that like Panos would've led whatever these are

636
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:16,395
Speaker 5:  So I. Think if there is an event at which they talk about it, I think that

637
00:36:16,395 --> 00:36:20,115
Speaker 5:  will be interesting. But also we're probably a generation or maybe even

638
00:36:20,215 --> 00:36:24,195
Speaker 5:  two away from new leaders showing big changes.

639
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:29,155
Speaker 5:  But I also kind of feel like, like I loved the Surface laptop at the beginning.

640
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:32,955
Speaker 5:  Loved it. It was so nicely designed. It was like soft and

641
00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:36,635
Speaker 5:  comfortable. It came in those good colors. The battery life was like, I loved

642
00:36:36,635 --> 00:36:39,875
Speaker 5:  that thing. And I feel like both the pro and the laptop

643
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:44,395
Speaker 5:  are kind of long in the tooth at this point. It feels like both

644
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:48,395
Speaker 5:  are in need of kind of a new idea about what they're

645
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:51,995
Speaker 5:  supposed to do for you. And I'm sure Microsoft will tell you a whole AI story

646
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:55,875
Speaker 5:  and there will be a copilot button and everything will be everything. But

647
00:36:56,455 --> 00:37:00,115
Speaker 5:  for me, like the there, there are bits and pieces of the design stuff that

648
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:03,355
Speaker 5:  Tom has been talking about, but I'm really curious to see if there is a bigger

649
00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:05,035
Speaker 5:  shift in the works here.

650
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:08,555
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And that thing about the cycles being long when Panas Pane was out

651
00:37:08,555 --> 00:37:11,475
Speaker 4:  there posting about how excited he was about the Alexa hub, I was like, you

652
00:37:11,475 --> 00:37:13,195
Speaker 4:  didn't know that was cunning, right?

653
00:37:13,475 --> 00:37:16,355
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That literally was finished before you started working.

654
00:37:18,555 --> 00:37:21,475
Speaker 4:  M like I wish I could show up and be like, I'm excited about other people's

655
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:23,355
Speaker 4:  ideas too. I'm in charge now.

656
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,955
Speaker 4:  I I agree with you, but I do think just how they position these products

657
00:37:28,405 --> 00:37:32,115
Speaker 4:  after the leader is gone and there is some new leadership that has to, you

658
00:37:32,115 --> 00:37:35,355
Speaker 4:  know, be accountable for even launching them. Like one thing you do is not

659
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:38,715
Speaker 4:  make them. Yeah, that's a choice. But I think they're gonna do it. I think

660
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:42,275
Speaker 4:  they're gonna launch them. I think Microsoft has to be in the game and yet

661
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:45,035
Speaker 4:  maybe they have a co-pilot button on them. Maybe they put chat CBT right

662
00:37:45,035 --> 00:37:48,715
Speaker 4:  in the camera just to look at you and be like, here's some weird

663
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,955
Speaker 4:  ideas I had. You should leave your wife.

664
00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:56,075
Speaker 4:  That's famously what chat, but he said to you, you remember Yeah,

665
00:37:56,265 --> 00:37:57,475
Speaker 4:  very remember morning for Kevin Ru.

666
00:37:57,905 --> 00:37:58,195
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

667
00:37:59,375 --> 00:37:59,875
Speaker 4:  So does Kevin.

668
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:03,755
Speaker 4:  So do many readers of the New York Times,

669
00:38:05,455 --> 00:38:08,795
Speaker 4:  but I all of that right is like you, you have to make these products for

670
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:12,595
Speaker 4:  a reason. And one thing we definitely just saw with Microsoft is some

671
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:16,595
Speaker 4:  big rethinks of why they do things. Yes. Like Xbox just went through

672
00:38:16,675 --> 00:38:20,595
Speaker 4:  a huge rethink of what is Xbox, what are we doing? Why do we make

673
00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:24,355
Speaker 4:  this stuff? And the answer was, we're gonna put the games in only

674
00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:27,755
Speaker 4:  people's platforms now. Like there's more money to be made on the games than

675
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:31,715
Speaker 4:  than making the games put hardware in your living room. And

676
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,435
Speaker 4:  I, I wonder if Surface is in that place too.

677
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:37,965
Speaker 5:  IIII think that's very possible. It's gonna be really interesting to see

678
00:38:37,965 --> 00:38:41,045
Speaker 5:  if Microsoft tries to tell a consumer story about these things

679
00:38:41,745 --> 00:38:45,645
Speaker 5:  or is just like, buy these for your point of sale people

680
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:49,195
Speaker 5:  at work. Which I think it might. Yeah, like I think one of the reasons

681
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:53,635
Speaker 5:  Panos left was reportedly that Microsoft was pulling back on some

682
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:56,395
Speaker 5:  of the ambitions for this stuff and that I think you, you might be right

683
00:38:56,395 --> 00:38:58,275
Speaker 5:  that we might start to see pretty fast. Yeah.

684
00:38:58,615 --> 00:39:01,915
Speaker 4:  All right. We should take a break and we should come back and it's time to

685
00:39:01,915 --> 00:39:04,915
Speaker 4:  get the, the Euro zone, which is a real thing.

686
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:09,555
Speaker 4:  It's a really cool name for a very boring idea. But we're gonna leave and

687
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:13,355
Speaker 4:  come back and then we're the VIR has goes to the Euro

688
00:39:13,425 --> 00:39:13,715
Speaker 4:  zone.

689
00:39:16,205 --> 00:39:16,955
Speaker 4:  We'll be right back.

690
00:40:16,355 --> 00:40:16,675
Speaker 7:  safely.

691
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:54,605
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back to clarify for our European listeners, the

692
00:40:54,605 --> 00:40:56,525
Speaker 4:  Euro zone is where they take the euro.

693
00:40:58,265 --> 00:41:01,725
Speaker 4:  It is a very cool name for a very boring thing. Places where you can spend

694
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:05,685
Speaker 4:  the Euro, which is only 20 of the 27 countries

695
00:41:06,145 --> 00:41:06,885
Speaker 4:  in the EU.

696
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:11,285
Speaker 5:  The Eurozone is also an amusement park that's just kind of like, it's just

697
00:41:11,285 --> 00:41:13,805
Speaker 5:  Europe everywhere. It's like Epcot, but it's all Europe.

698
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,085
Speaker 4:  You're just like, here's some cheese

699
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:20,605
Speaker 4:  chocolates. Everyone's very trim. They were, they were, everyone's walking

700
00:41:20,705 --> 00:41:22,805
Speaker 4:  so much. And even that they eat the carbs in the dairy

701
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:28,125
Speaker 4:  Eurozone. you know, there's a, there's a proposal

702
00:41:28,345 --> 00:41:32,045
Speaker 4:  in in the EU to relabel the fat burning zone on

703
00:41:32,205 --> 00:41:33,405
Speaker 4:  treadmills as the Eurozone

704
00:41:35,985 --> 00:41:39,605
Speaker 5:  Had me the first half. I ain't gonna lie, boy.

705
00:41:41,685 --> 00:41:45,095
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So look, we're not going to the Eurozone. All right, we're going to

706
00:41:45,095 --> 00:41:47,895
Speaker 4:  the bigger Venn diagram of the Eurozone. the EU itself.

707
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:49,655
Speaker 4:  Welcome.

708
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,535
Speaker 4:  the EU won't stop. They're, they're, they're doing things. They love regulating

709
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:59,615
Speaker 4:  companies. It's, it's what they do and maybe they're gonna do

710
00:41:59,615 --> 00:42:03,015
Speaker 4:  a good job this time. Maybe some real changes will happen. We can talk about

711
00:42:03,045 --> 00:42:05,975
Speaker 4:  some changes in the past, which I think informed changes here. But the Digital

712
00:42:05,975 --> 00:42:09,815
Speaker 4:  Markets Act has arrived today, Wednesday, March 6th. The day we are

713
00:42:10,015 --> 00:42:13,975
Speaker 4:  speaking is the day has gone into effect. A bunch of big platforms have

714
00:42:13,975 --> 00:42:17,375
Speaker 4:  been designated as gatekeepers and they have to change how they work. They

715
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:21,015
Speaker 4:  have to become more interoperable, they have to provide more choices to

716
00:42:21,215 --> 00:42:24,255
Speaker 4:  consumers. All kinds of things are happening. David, can you run us down?

717
00:42:24,255 --> 00:42:25,495
Speaker 4:  There's quite a few. Sure.

718
00:42:25,495 --> 00:42:29,215
Speaker 5:  So there's basically hits six companies. You have Alphabet,

719
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:33,055
Speaker 5:  Amazon, apple Bite, dance Meta and Microsoft.

720
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:37,895
Speaker 5:  There is a very real, one of these things is not like the other thing with

721
00:42:37,895 --> 00:42:40,175
Speaker 5:  Bite dance there, which I actually think is very interesting and we should

722
00:42:40,175 --> 00:42:43,735
Speaker 5:  talk about. But essentially all of these companies have been

723
00:42:43,735 --> 00:42:47,575
Speaker 5:  designated as like you said, gatekeepers, which means they are the ones who

724
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:51,335
Speaker 5:  are so powerful and so important that they should not

725
00:42:51,355 --> 00:42:54,975
Speaker 5:  be allowed to just do whatever they want. And the way that the EU

726
00:42:55,255 --> 00:42:58,695
Speaker 5:  regulates that and has decided has been complicated and everybody is appealing

727
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:02,095
Speaker 5:  everything and it's all kind of a mess. But essentially we can go through

728
00:43:02,095 --> 00:43:04,855
Speaker 5:  each company if you'd like to. But essentially the way it has boiled down

729
00:43:05,555 --> 00:43:08,575
Speaker 5:  is that these companies now have to offer more

730
00:43:09,055 --> 00:43:12,495
Speaker 5:  transparency and data protections for users.

731
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:16,015
Speaker 5:  And that shows up in a bunch of different ways. Amazon has had to give

732
00:43:16,815 --> 00:43:19,695
Speaker 5:  advertisers more transparency over like what they're doing and how their

733
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:23,295
Speaker 5:  ads are doing. Which is a strange and sort of obvious seeming thing.

734
00:43:24,155 --> 00:43:28,095
Speaker 5:  TikTok is now letting you pull a lot of your data out of TikTok and put it

735
00:43:28,095 --> 00:43:31,935
Speaker 5:  into other apps that support it. Meta is giving you more ways

736
00:43:31,995 --> 00:43:35,415
Speaker 5:  to protect your data and not have it shared across meta services. So the

737
00:43:35,415 --> 00:43:38,975
Speaker 5:  idea is like your data should be your data. This is one of the things the

738
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,855
Speaker 5:  EU has been harping on for a long time, right? That I should be in control

739
00:43:41,855 --> 00:43:45,695
Speaker 5:  of my data about me on the internet and all of these six companies are having

740
00:43:45,695 --> 00:43:49,615
Speaker 5:  to do a lot more. Then there are big debates about app stores.

741
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:52,695
Speaker 5:  I think this one's largely about Apple, at least from what we've seen so

742
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:56,095
Speaker 5:  far. But we'll hit Google and the Play Store in pretty real ways too.

743
00:43:56,885 --> 00:44:00,815
Speaker 5:  There's the question of like, are you allowed to build

744
00:44:00,835 --> 00:44:04,575
Speaker 5:  in your own apps and preference them over others? So Microsoft

745
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:08,815
Speaker 5:  in the EU is now allowing you to disable Bing in Uninstall

746
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:12,535
Speaker 5:  Edge and a bunch of other Microsoft apps. So the idea is just these big companies

747
00:44:13,415 --> 00:44:16,975
Speaker 5:  relentlessly self preference themselves and the EU is essentially saying

748
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:21,295
Speaker 5:  you have to stop doing that. And there's a fallout in a million directions

749
00:44:21,295 --> 00:44:24,815
Speaker 5:  from that. But that is I think kind of the top line as I've come to think

750
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:25,095
Speaker 5:  about it.

751
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:28,855
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And what's really interesting about that is the amount of big

752
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:32,745
Speaker 4:  businesses that exist in the world that are

753
00:44:33,095 --> 00:44:36,745
Speaker 4:  organized or at least adapted to that self preferencing. Yeah.

754
00:44:36,745 --> 00:44:39,745
Speaker 4:  Google searches. I think maybe the clearest example of this in the world,

755
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:44,145
Speaker 4:  many, many huge industries are just adapted to the notion

756
00:44:44,175 --> 00:44:46,465
Speaker 4:  that Google is where people search for things.

757
00:44:46,655 --> 00:44:47,145
Speaker 5:  Totally.

758
00:44:47,405 --> 00:44:50,665
Speaker 4:  So today I think a bunch of travel services like Flight

759
00:44:51,385 --> 00:44:54,585
Speaker 4:  Airlines and hotels and other kinds of things, put out a letter that's like,

760
00:44:54,805 --> 00:44:57,825
Speaker 4:  we know Google's gonna change, but it should still send us as much traffic

761
00:44:57,885 --> 00:45:01,265
Speaker 4:  as it used to before. Right? And there's like a fear that like change will

762
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:04,945
Speaker 4:  lead to a different result as opposed to somehow being better but the same.

763
00:45:05,315 --> 00:45:08,465
Speaker 4:  Which is a fascinating way to think about

764
00:45:09,185 --> 00:45:12,665
Speaker 4:  regulatory change. The other thing that's happening is that

765
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:15,865
Speaker 4:  the changes are hitting things that have never been different.

766
00:45:17,185 --> 00:45:20,325
Speaker 4:  In particular a bunch of Apple services, right?

767
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:22,845
Speaker 5:  I think those two things are actually really aligned and I'd never really

768
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,405
Speaker 5:  thought about it like that until you just said that. But there is this fascinating

769
00:45:25,405 --> 00:45:28,965
Speaker 5:  thing where it has been like this for so long that

770
00:45:29,325 --> 00:45:33,165
Speaker 5:  actually even if in theory some of these things are going to get better and

771
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:36,805
Speaker 5:  more pro competition and more fair, which there are a lot of

772
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:39,925
Speaker 5:  smart people who argue it's actually going to be none of those things. But

773
00:45:39,925 --> 00:45:43,605
Speaker 5:  even if it is those things, it's still going to screw up

774
00:45:43,945 --> 00:45:47,685
Speaker 5:  all of the businesses that are going to be affected by it just because

775
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:51,245
Speaker 5:  it has been this way for so long and, and just

776
00:45:51,705 --> 00:45:55,045
Speaker 5:  the sheer amount of change that is gonna come for all of these companies,

777
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:58,205
Speaker 5:  even if it ends up being good in the end, is gonna be such a like

778
00:45:58,735 --> 00:46:02,725
Speaker 5:  crazy whirlwind of new stuff over the next 12

779
00:46:02,725 --> 00:46:06,165
Speaker 5:  months that it's gonna like, it's gonna change a lot of things. And we should

780
00:46:06,165 --> 00:46:09,965
Speaker 5:  say almost all of this is happening just in the

781
00:46:10,165 --> 00:46:14,125
Speaker 5:  EU and the EEA, the European economic area. And if I'm being honest, I

782
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:17,005
Speaker 5:  don't totally understand the distinction, but I know our international team

783
00:46:17,005 --> 00:46:20,005
Speaker 5:  gets really mad when we say one and it's not the other. So just know that

784
00:46:20,005 --> 00:46:23,165
Speaker 5:  it is whichever one of those is correct is what I'm saying.

785
00:46:24,065 --> 00:46:27,925
Speaker 5:  But we expected a lot of this to be like big global change. I think that

786
00:46:28,025 --> 00:46:31,485
Speaker 5:  the idea was whatever what happened in the EU would sort of roll out everywhere

787
00:46:31,485 --> 00:46:35,125
Speaker 5:  in the world. And that is in almost every case not happening at all. And

788
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,965
Speaker 5:  in fact what's happening is like the, the European internet is going to be

789
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:40,845
Speaker 5:  one thing and the rest of the world is going to be another So

790
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:44,205
Speaker 4:  I think one of the reasons we all thought this would happen is

791
00:46:45,325 --> 00:46:48,805
Speaker 4:  I always think about the model of car regulation in the United States.

792
00:46:49,415 --> 00:46:53,085
Speaker 4:  California is a huge market for cars in the United States. It passes

793
00:46:53,155 --> 00:46:56,965
Speaker 4:  some rules. The easiest way to make cars is to make them comply to California's

794
00:46:56,965 --> 00:47:00,285
Speaker 4:  rules. And so California's rules sort of affect everybody else across the

795
00:47:00,285 --> 00:47:03,765
Speaker 4:  country. 'cause the cars are built for California, like emission standards

796
00:47:03,765 --> 00:47:06,685
Speaker 4:  and things like that all happen for California. You can see, okay, Europe's

797
00:47:06,685 --> 00:47:09,085
Speaker 4:  a big market, they're gonna pass some rules. We're gonna have to design the

798
00:47:09,085 --> 00:47:12,205
Speaker 4:  products for the most constricted market that will hit the United States

799
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:15,525
Speaker 4:  as well. And what all of these companies are saying is, no, our monopolies

800
00:47:15,525 --> 00:47:19,245
Speaker 4:  are pretty good actually. So we're gonna go ahead and

801
00:47:19,245 --> 00:47:22,885
Speaker 4:  spend more money making weird special European versions of our products.

802
00:47:23,265 --> 00:47:27,165
Speaker 4:  And then unless you force us to, we're gonna keep

803
00:47:27,165 --> 00:47:31,085
Speaker 4:  taking the profits, the monopoly profits everywhere else. And I I,

804
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:34,765
Speaker 4:  that is a rational response. Like many, many, many things

805
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,725
Speaker 4:  are different in the United States versus Europe. Like Europe has a bunch

806
00:47:38,725 --> 00:47:42,645
Speaker 4:  of different regulations than we do. but it, it's weird because

807
00:47:42,765 --> 00:47:46,245
Speaker 4:  I think people assume in idealism of some of these

808
00:47:46,685 --> 00:47:50,485
Speaker 4:  companies that what they want is to compete or what they want

809
00:47:50,665 --> 00:47:54,565
Speaker 4:  is a more level playing field for consumers. And here it's pretty

810
00:47:54,615 --> 00:47:58,285
Speaker 4:  naked that what they want is to preserve their monopoly profits.

811
00:47:58,665 --> 00:48:02,365
Speaker 4:  So they will do a bunch of extra work over there to make a different European

812
00:48:02,685 --> 00:48:06,565
Speaker 4:  internet. And unless they are forced that whatever those goals

813
00:48:06,565 --> 00:48:08,765
Speaker 4:  are will never come here or anywhere else.

814
00:48:09,415 --> 00:48:13,245
Speaker 5:  Right? Yeah. And I think at this moment there's pretty strong

815
00:48:13,245 --> 00:48:17,045
Speaker 5:  indications that they're right to make that bet that whatever

816
00:48:17,065 --> 00:48:19,645
Speaker 5:  is happening there is not going to percolate elsewhere. Because so far it

817
00:48:19,645 --> 00:48:23,605
Speaker 5:  really hasn't. But at least so far, I mean,

818
00:48:24,385 --> 00:48:27,565
Speaker 5:  am I right to say that the thing that's gonna hit the most people most quickly

819
00:48:27,665 --> 00:48:31,045
Speaker 5:  is this stuff with iOS, right? It feels like Apple is the one that is like

820
00:48:31,765 --> 00:48:35,685
Speaker 5:  changing in the biggest ways, the most quickly. And I

821
00:48:35,685 --> 00:48:38,605
Speaker 5:  guess on the side also pissing off the most people the most quickly.

822
00:48:40,355 --> 00:48:40,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

823
00:48:40,645 --> 00:48:44,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah. I think that's a hundred percent what's gonna happen because

824
00:48:44,185 --> 00:48:48,085
Speaker 6:  that's what everybody actually uses right now. And that's actually

825
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:52,085
Speaker 6:  being changed right now in some cool ways,

826
00:48:52,145 --> 00:48:55,325
Speaker 6:  but mainly ways with, what is it? A lot of feelings

827
00:48:56,065 --> 00:48:57,205
Speaker 6:  is what NELI was saying early.

828
00:48:57,915 --> 00:48:58,845
Speaker 4:  It's a lot of feelings.

829
00:48:59,385 --> 00:49:03,285
Speaker 6:  So many feelings are happening. Apple is like screaming as

830
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:06,845
Speaker 6:  it goes to do all of this and everybody like in a way that

831
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:10,285
Speaker 6:  everyone is having to learn more about app store policies than I think most

832
00:49:10,285 --> 00:49:12,125
Speaker 6:  of the European Union ever wanted to

833
00:49:13,865 --> 00:49:17,685
Speaker 6:  in a really, like, I'm just kind of surprised by how, how mad Apple

834
00:49:17,685 --> 00:49:21,245
Speaker 6:  is being about all of this. How loudly

835
00:49:21,415 --> 00:49:23,005
Speaker 6:  angry Apple is being this,

836
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:26,725
Speaker 5:  It's true of this. And you, you always feel like Apple wants you to not think

837
00:49:26,725 --> 00:49:30,405
Speaker 5:  about all the M missions. Yeah. That make Apple, apple. And

838
00:49:30,825 --> 00:49:34,765
Speaker 5:  now the fact that, like I can tell you developer deals off

839
00:49:34,765 --> 00:49:38,725
Speaker 5:  the top of my head feels like a problem for me, a problem for Apple,

840
00:49:39,045 --> 00:49:42,485
Speaker 5:  a problem for the world. Like yep, this is a strange place we've entered

841
00:49:42,595 --> 00:49:43,445
Speaker 5:  into, and

842
00:49:43,645 --> 00:49:47,205
Speaker 6:  I think it was always gonna kind of happen too, right? If if, if they, like

843
00:49:47,205 --> 00:49:50,925
Speaker 6:  you guys were talking about this, if, if they open it up, if, if we start

844
00:49:50,985 --> 00:49:53,765
Speaker 6:  paying attention to this stuff that we didn't really pay attention to for

845
00:49:53,805 --> 00:49:56,885
Speaker 6:  a very long time, then yeah people are gonna wanna have these conversations

846
00:49:57,095 --> 00:50:01,045
Speaker 6:  about how much money Spotify is getting on the backend and that sort of thing.

847
00:50:02,205 --> 00:50:05,825
Speaker 6:  But at the same time, that is really bad for both Spotify and Apple's

848
00:50:06,065 --> 00:50:09,305
Speaker 6:  business. Yeah. Or not their business, but their reputation with the public

849
00:50:09,935 --> 00:50:12,785
Speaker 6:  more than anything else. Like the business is all gonna keep going. Apple's

850
00:50:12,785 --> 00:50:16,625
Speaker 6:  gonna make a lot of money with this new thing where they have to

851
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:19,395
Speaker 6:  pay 50 Euro cents

852
00:50:20,405 --> 00:50:20,755
Speaker 6:  cents.

853
00:50:22,555 --> 00:50:24,635
Speaker 4:  European Union, I believe it's pronounced dubs

854
00:50:27,145 --> 00:50:30,925
Speaker 6:  For every download over that first million, including every update, like

855
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:34,765
Speaker 6:  app update. Like that's insane. That's a lot of

856
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:38,405
Speaker 6:  money. Yep. And they're being so petulant about it in a way where I'm like,

857
00:50:39,105 --> 00:50:42,325
Speaker 6:  you just got hit with a $2 billion fine. Like

858
00:50:43,075 --> 00:50:43,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

859
00:50:43,795 --> 00:50:47,485
Speaker 6:  What do you do? You wanna get more. That's what usually like,

860
00:50:48,505 --> 00:50:52,125
Speaker 6:  so it's weird. I'm just, I keep being surprised by it.

861
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:55,605
Speaker 5:  Neil, I am curious how you feel about this. 'cause I, I feel like we've reached

862
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:59,205
Speaker 5:  a point where this fight has been going on so long,

863
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:03,325
Speaker 5:  specifically between Apple on one side and Spotify and Epic

864
00:51:03,665 --> 00:51:07,205
Speaker 5:  on behalf of lots of others, but especially those two companies on the other

865
00:51:07,205 --> 00:51:10,405
Speaker 5:  side. And it really seems like no one

866
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:14,805
Speaker 5:  looks good in any of this fight. Like I, I feel like everyone has lost

867
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:18,765
Speaker 5:  this fight now and it's just bad times all around.

868
00:51:18,765 --> 00:51:22,045
Speaker 5:  Nobody's happy, everything's worse. This just seems like it's sucks.

869
00:51:22,555 --> 00:51:25,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm always thinking about the beginning of the app store

870
00:51:26,315 --> 00:51:30,045
Speaker 4:  when the thing that Apple would compare it to was

871
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:33,805
Speaker 4:  app distribution on pre iPhone smartphones, which was largely

872
00:51:33,805 --> 00:51:37,685
Speaker 4:  handled by carriers. And carriers were capricious and they

873
00:51:37,685 --> 00:51:41,205
Speaker 4:  would get in developers ways and they would charge exorbitant

874
00:51:41,395 --> 00:51:41,685
Speaker 4:  fees

875
00:51:43,585 --> 00:51:47,245
Speaker 4:  and it was bad. It was bad. Yeah. And I would just

876
00:51:47,245 --> 00:51:50,925
Speaker 4:  caution Apple that having a reputation for being

877
00:51:50,925 --> 00:51:54,845
Speaker 4:  capricious and charging huge fees and getting in developers' ways

878
00:51:55,185 --> 00:51:58,445
Speaker 4:  and then issuing press releases saying things like, Spotify has never paid

879
00:51:58,445 --> 00:52:02,405
Speaker 4:  us a cent to be on the iPhone is like, but everyone who has

880
00:52:02,405 --> 00:52:03,485
Speaker 4:  an iPhone paid you the money,

881
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:05,685
Speaker 5:  Right? Yeah. They bought an iPhone.

882
00:52:05,715 --> 00:52:09,125
Speaker 4:  This is the problem that Apple is running into almost

883
00:52:09,635 --> 00:52:13,525
Speaker 4:  insistently by, in by saying that when

884
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:17,325
Speaker 4:  you have an application on someone's computer, apple deserves a

885
00:52:17,325 --> 00:52:21,285
Speaker 4:  cut of what happens in that app. And I, that is as simple as

886
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:25,005
Speaker 4:  it gets, right? Like you either agree with that proposition or you

887
00:52:25,005 --> 00:52:28,725
Speaker 4:  don't. When you have a computer, should the person who sold you the computer

888
00:52:29,465 --> 00:52:33,285
Speaker 4:  be in between you and the things you can do on that computer? There are some

889
00:52:33,305 --> 00:52:36,325
Speaker 4:  really good arguments for Apple being in between

890
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:41,755
Speaker 4:  the iPhone customer and what they can do on the iPhone. iPhones

891
00:52:41,895 --> 00:52:45,275
Speaker 4:  go everywhere with people. They contain an enormous amount of their personal

892
00:52:45,275 --> 00:52:49,155
Speaker 4:  data. They can track you, they can be used for horrible

893
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:53,075
Speaker 4:  things. They have a shit load of cameras on them. Just more every year. They're

894
00:52:53,075 --> 00:52:56,435
Speaker 4:  like, we're up to five. you know, it's like

895
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:59,875
Speaker 4:  there's a lot of reasons where you want a bunch of

896
00:53:00,465 --> 00:53:04,395
Speaker 4:  extremely motivated, very smart computer scientists and policy people

897
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:08,395
Speaker 4:  sitting between a computer user and the things that can happen on their computer.

898
00:53:08,575 --> 00:53:12,395
Speaker 4:  And in particular what software other people can run on a computer. But you

899
00:53:12,465 --> 00:53:15,635
Speaker 4:  have to have an exit ramp. And the reason you wanna protect the computer

900
00:53:15,745 --> 00:53:19,395
Speaker 4:  user should be for safety, not because of money. And

901
00:53:19,395 --> 00:53:23,155
Speaker 4:  what's happening right now is Apple is using the moral argument for

902
00:53:23,215 --> 00:53:26,100
Speaker 4:  we need to keep our users safe. We need to, to protect them from themselves.

903
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,365
Speaker 4:  When they use these computers that go around in their pockets, everywhere

904
00:53:28,365 --> 00:53:31,995
Speaker 4:  they go, they have pictures of their kids on them and they're using that

905
00:53:31,995 --> 00:53:35,835
Speaker 4:  to justify their economic argument. And that I think that's where it's falling

906
00:53:35,835 --> 00:53:39,795
Speaker 4:  it down. And, and I think that is candidly where some

907
00:53:39,795 --> 00:53:43,675
Speaker 4:  of the people at Apple are at risk of damaging their repu, like

908
00:53:43,675 --> 00:53:47,235
Speaker 4:  their personal reputations inside this community because they keep saying

909
00:53:47,235 --> 00:53:47,675
Speaker 4:  it out loud.

910
00:53:48,105 --> 00:53:51,395
Speaker 6:  It's not even Spotify though for me it's, it's what's happening with Epic

911
00:53:51,615 --> 00:53:55,075
Speaker 6:  and how they were just like, okay, we, we don't trust you anymore so we're

912
00:53:55,075 --> 00:53:56,995
Speaker 6:  gonna take your developer account away again.

913
00:53:57,255 --> 00:54:00,595
Speaker 4:  So this is what I mean this is the one. Yeah. Right. Yeah. This is the one.

914
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:04,675
Speaker 4:  And it happens. It's so precious. The DMA was announced an Apple's compliance

915
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:08,515
Speaker 4:  plan with the DMA was announced and Epic immediately reacted by saying, we

916
00:54:08,515 --> 00:54:12,435
Speaker 4:  will have an app store with Fortnite on it in the EU and the

917
00:54:12,435 --> 00:54:15,075
Speaker 4:  Epic game store is gonna happen and we're gonna do it. And we're gonna prove

918
00:54:15,225 --> 00:54:19,075
Speaker 4:  that even under these rules, which we Epic think are too restrictive.

919
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:23,555
Speaker 4:  'cause there's a lot of rules. Apple's gonna make all these Alternative app

920
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:27,115
Speaker 4:  stores under a lot of rules which are basically designed to make them not

921
00:54:27,115 --> 00:54:31,075
Speaker 4:  good. Yep. Yep. Right. Like Apple's design of how Alternative app stores

922
00:54:31,075 --> 00:54:34,795
Speaker 4:  should work on, on iOS under the DMA is

923
00:54:35,065 --> 00:54:38,955
Speaker 4:  basically meant to have it not be a viable thing. And Epic's

924
00:54:39,155 --> 00:54:42,595
Speaker 4:  point has been, we're gonna do it. We'll have Fortnite, we'll bring the other

925
00:54:42,595 --> 00:54:46,115
Speaker 4:  game developers on. And even under these restrictions which we think are

926
00:54:46,255 --> 00:54:49,795
Speaker 4:  bad in our malicious compliance, we think it'll be good and prove the point.

927
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:54,035
Speaker 4:  And Epic today, just literally today before we started

928
00:54:54,035 --> 00:54:57,875
Speaker 4:  podcasting, had a press conference. Tim Sweeney spoke, he

929
00:54:57,955 --> 00:55:00,995
Speaker 4:  took questions from reporters, including our own John Porter and they released

930
00:55:01,115 --> 00:55:04,715
Speaker 4:  a bunch of emails between Epic and Apple, including emails between Tim

931
00:55:04,715 --> 00:55:08,475
Speaker 4:  Sweeney and Phil Schiller where Epic applied to be a developer

932
00:55:08,935 --> 00:55:11,995
Speaker 4:  to make this app store in the EU under, I believe it's Epic's game Sweden.

933
00:55:13,085 --> 00:55:16,995
Speaker 4:  Apple wrote back to Epic and said, how can we trust you? You've done

934
00:55:16,995 --> 00:55:19,875
Speaker 4:  all this stuff in the past. Tim Sweeney wrote to Phil Shoulder and said,

935
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:23,535
Speaker 4:  you can trust us. Tell me what assurances you need. And they

936
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:28,135
Speaker 4:  got, they sh and Apple replied, at least according to the emails we

937
00:55:28,135 --> 00:55:31,895
Speaker 4:  have seen from Epic, Apple's free to send us some other emails. But Tim

938
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:34,855
Speaker 4:  Sweeney said, what other assurances do you need? And Apple replied by sending

939
00:55:34,935 --> 00:55:38,735
Speaker 4:  a letter from a lawyer saying You have criticized the app store and

940
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:42,215
Speaker 4:  our plan for compliance in the EU, you've proven yourself to be untrustworthy

941
00:55:42,275 --> 00:55:46,055
Speaker 4:  and we are revoking your app store privileges Yh. And it's like, what are

942
00:55:46,055 --> 00:55:49,935
Speaker 4:  you doing? Like why would you do that? Like the

943
00:55:49,935 --> 00:55:52,815
Speaker 4:  only thing that's gonna happen is Tim Sweeney who loves a press conference

944
00:55:52,815 --> 00:55:55,775
Speaker 4:  about how shitty Apple is right. Is gonna hold a press conference about how

945
00:55:55,775 --> 00:55:59,495
Speaker 4:  shitty you are and a bunch of European regulators who you have already

946
00:55:59,645 --> 00:56:03,575
Speaker 4:  accused of being Anti Apple are gonna look

947
00:56:03,575 --> 00:56:07,455
Speaker 4:  at your behavior and find you again. Yep. Like

948
00:56:07,645 --> 00:56:11,535
Speaker 4:  this is not like, I know, I know a lot of kindergartners,

949
00:56:11,615 --> 00:56:15,255
Speaker 4:  I have a kindergartner, I know kindergartners who are more

950
00:56:15,255 --> 00:56:16,575
Speaker 4:  politically adept than this.

951
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,095
Speaker 4:  I just don't understand it. And that's what I, when I'm saying like people's

952
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:25,325
Speaker 4:  personal reputations like this feels like they are personally mad as

953
00:56:25,325 --> 00:56:29,165
Speaker 4:  opposed to playing the long game with a bunch of regulators. And

954
00:56:29,635 --> 00:56:32,565
Speaker 4:  just because we're speaking the day after Super Tuesday and we all have to

955
00:56:32,565 --> 00:56:35,445
Speaker 4:  think about the prospect of Donald Trump once again being our president,

956
00:56:35,805 --> 00:56:39,525
Speaker 4:  I will remind everyone that Tim Cook did the best

957
00:56:39,785 --> 00:56:43,045
Speaker 4:  job of managing Donald Trump than anyone.

958
00:56:43,495 --> 00:56:47,205
Speaker 4:  Right. Donald Trump went to have put a trade war up on China

959
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:51,405
Speaker 4:  and Tim Cook managed Apple through a trade war. Yeah. Because he was

960
00:56:51,515 --> 00:56:55,405
Speaker 4:  able to distance himself personally from what Apple needed and

961
00:56:55,435 --> 00:56:59,405
Speaker 4:  what he probably felt and advocate for

962
00:56:59,405 --> 00:57:03,285
Speaker 4:  Apple's interests. And I think here there's just a collapse like there,

963
00:57:03,285 --> 00:57:05,925
Speaker 4:  there's just some angry people. And I think that's super weird.

964
00:57:06,685 --> 00:57:10,045
Speaker 5:  I really, I'm with you. I cannot make heads or tails of how this went down

965
00:57:10,045 --> 00:57:13,365
Speaker 5:  like this because there was also, after Apple made its announcements about

966
00:57:13,435 --> 00:57:17,325
Speaker 5:  what iOS 17.4 was gonna be, one of the things that did that Tim

967
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:21,165
Speaker 5:  Sweeney hilariously gave Apple credit for was reinstate

968
00:57:21,225 --> 00:57:25,045
Speaker 5:  Epic's developer account. Which it had banned what feels like a million years

969
00:57:25,045 --> 00:57:28,925
Speaker 5:  ago now when the whole Fortnite debacle first happened and started

970
00:57:29,065 --> 00:57:32,845
Speaker 5:  all of the fights between Epic and Apple about this stuff.

971
00:57:33,185 --> 00:57:37,005
Speaker 5:  So there was this sense in which it was like, okay, apple is at least

972
00:57:37,355 --> 00:57:41,005
Speaker 5:  outwardly going to attempt to look like it's turning over a new leaf and

973
00:57:41,115 --> 00:57:43,005
Speaker 5:  play nice in in these spaces.

974
00:57:44,815 --> 00:57:48,635
Speaker 5:  And then to just so swiftly say, just kidding. And just

975
00:57:48,745 --> 00:57:52,715
Speaker 5:  yank the rug out from under them. Again, knowing full well what Epic

976
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:53,235
Speaker 5:  is gonna do

977
00:57:54,755 --> 00:57:58,575
Speaker 5:  is it's just weird. I just truly cannot figure it out because it is so

978
00:57:59,365 --> 00:58:03,215
Speaker 5:  obvious that it was gonna go like this if this is how you played it. Epic

979
00:58:03,315 --> 00:58:07,255
Speaker 5:  is the single loudest voice building a third party

980
00:58:07,355 --> 00:58:11,095
Speaker 5:  app store. And like Apple either wanted to light this on fire

981
00:58:11,435 --> 00:58:13,935
Speaker 5:  or should have known it was going to be lighting this on fire. So

982
00:58:13,935 --> 00:58:17,895
Speaker 4:  We do have a statement from Apple now that kind of directly gets at what

983
00:58:17,895 --> 00:58:21,145
Speaker 4:  you're saying and it, it just feels like maybe they didn't do it as cleanly

984
00:58:21,145 --> 00:58:24,625
Speaker 4:  as they wanted to. So we reached out to Apple, we asked what's going on here?

985
00:58:26,955 --> 00:58:30,825
Speaker 4:  Apple mad. That's the whole statement. Here's the quote.

986
00:58:31,085 --> 00:58:34,585
Speaker 4:  Epic's egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple

987
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:37,905
Speaker 4:  led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate any or all

988
00:58:37,905 --> 00:58:41,225
Speaker 4:  of Epic games wholly and subsidiaries affiliates or other entities under

989
00:58:41,225 --> 00:58:45,025
Speaker 4:  Epic games as control at any time. And at Apple's sole discretion, in

990
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:48,785
Speaker 4:  light of epic's past and ongoing behavior,

991
00:58:49,315 --> 00:58:53,265
Speaker 4:  apple chose to exercise that. Right. So this is just nakedly revenge.

992
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:53,905
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

993
00:58:53,935 --> 00:58:57,865
Speaker 5:  Well and the ongoing behavior is Tim Sweeney continuing to be loudly mad

994
00:58:58,085 --> 00:59:01,905
Speaker 5:  on Twitter about what's going on with the DMA.

995
00:59:02,595 --> 00:59:06,465
Speaker 4:  Great. But I'm just like, you could have just said, in light of the

996
00:59:06,645 --> 00:59:10,305
Speaker 4:  epic's past behavior, You don't have to say ongoing

997
00:59:10,825 --> 00:59:10,945
Speaker 4:  behavior.

998
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,505
Speaker 5:  Yeah, fair.

999
00:59:12,035 --> 00:59:15,585
Speaker 4:  Right. And that's the part where it's like, oh, this company is just a vengeful.

1000
00:59:16,165 --> 00:59:20,105
Speaker 4:  You can say, look, we had a lawsuit. They broke the rules. We sued them,

1001
00:59:20,335 --> 00:59:23,765
Speaker 4:  they sued us. We had an antitrust trial. The result of the

1002
00:59:23,765 --> 00:59:27,325
Speaker 4:  antitrust trial is we don't have to do business with them. We are just gonna

1003
00:59:27,325 --> 00:59:30,245
Speaker 4:  not, we're gonna keep not doing business with them. That relationship was

1004
00:59:30,245 --> 00:59:34,205
Speaker 4:  broken saying we sort of maybe thought we'd do business with

1005
00:59:34,205 --> 00:59:37,685
Speaker 4:  you and we approved a thing and we did some weird letters. Ah,

1006
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:42,325
Speaker 4:  it, you know, like I, I don't know. There's just something that, like

1007
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:46,365
Speaker 4:  If, you want to build a business on these platforms. I don't

1008
00:59:46,715 --> 00:59:50,685
Speaker 4:  know that, that feels like a stable foundation. And I think a lot of these

1009
00:59:50,845 --> 00:59:54,605
Speaker 4:  companies, Spotify, Netflix, Epic, whoever we've heard now is,

1010
00:59:54,695 --> 00:59:58,565
Speaker 4:  David pointed out earlier, we have just heard too much about the

1011
00:59:58,565 --> 01:00:02,465
Speaker 4:  reality of doing business on the store. And at the

1012
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:06,385
Speaker 4:  end I think consumers don't know. They don't feel it. Right? Like it's

1013
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:09,905
Speaker 4:  hard to be sad about a thing that doesn't exist. But the point of this regulation

1014
01:00:10,045 --> 01:00:13,785
Speaker 4:  is like, what if it was different? What if the stores are more vibrant? What

1015
01:00:13,785 --> 01:00:17,585
Speaker 4:  if there were more kinds of apps, including apps Apple would never allow?

1016
01:00:18,645 --> 01:00:22,245
Speaker 4:  I I am shocked we have not seen a store spring up

1017
01:00:22,355 --> 01:00:26,165
Speaker 4:  just for gambling in, in Europe. Right? Like European laws of

1018
01:00:26,445 --> 01:00:28,885
Speaker 4:  gambling are actually much more permissive than laws in the United States

1019
01:00:28,885 --> 01:00:32,685
Speaker 4:  about gambling. I'm shocked that there is not already a storefront for

1020
01:00:32,885 --> 01:00:35,525
Speaker 4:  gambling apps in Europe because Apple would never allow it. And it's like

1021
01:00:35,525 --> 01:00:39,445
Speaker 4:  you can, I, I'm not a gambler. I go to Vegas and I, I ask

1022
01:00:39,445 --> 01:00:42,125
Speaker 4:  people how much money they're gonna spend on gambling and I spend that money

1023
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:45,925
Speaker 4:  on limousines 'cause that is a better investment my friend. Every single

1024
01:00:45,925 --> 01:00:49,725
Speaker 4:  time it has been for decades. Everyone remembers the lis no one remembers

1025
01:00:49,725 --> 01:00:53,685
Speaker 4:  the the black. I remember the Limone pretty good. It was good. I'm

1026
01:00:53,685 --> 01:00:56,365
Speaker 4:  not a gambler. It's like, whatever. I'm just saying like that is a world

1027
01:00:56,365 --> 01:00:59,165
Speaker 4:  that could exist that is an industry that could exist that Apple right now

1028
01:00:59,165 --> 01:01:02,165
Speaker 4:  just prevents from existing. There are lots and lots and lots of things like

1029
01:01:02,165 --> 01:01:06,085
Speaker 4:  this and it's hard to prove the negative. And I think Apple not

1030
01:01:06,085 --> 01:01:09,965
Speaker 4:  even allowing Epic to prove the negative is like all

1031
01:01:09,965 --> 01:01:12,925
Speaker 4:  they're proving is that they're capricious. Yep. And they're, they're pretty

1032
01:01:13,065 --> 01:01:16,925
Speaker 4:  mad. And I, I just, I don't know if that is the smart political

1033
01:01:16,925 --> 01:01:20,735
Speaker 4:  play and you might feel it's a smart moral play, but it just feels like a

1034
01:01:20,735 --> 01:01:23,575
Speaker 4:  bunch of European regulators are not gonna look at that and be like, yes,

1035
01:01:23,715 --> 01:01:26,695
Speaker 4:  we, we also have to abide by what an American court said.

1036
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:31,055
Speaker 5:  Right? Yeah. Well I think in this case, like so much of the question

1037
01:01:31,175 --> 01:01:34,615
Speaker 5:  of what's happening on iOS particularly is, is

1038
01:01:34,845 --> 01:01:38,775
Speaker 5:  somewhere in this gray area between technically doing

1039
01:01:38,775 --> 01:01:41,735
Speaker 5:  what is required, right? The sort of malicious compliance that a lot of folks

1040
01:01:41,735 --> 01:01:45,655
Speaker 5:  have con have talked to Apple about and doing things

1041
01:01:45,685 --> 01:01:49,015
Speaker 5:  that are just nakedly not solving the problem that you claim they're solving.

1042
01:01:49,015 --> 01:01:52,615
Speaker 5:  Right? Like I think the, the Apple's browser choice

1043
01:01:52,615 --> 01:01:55,455
Speaker 5:  screen on iOS in the EU is to me perfect

1044
01:01:56,415 --> 01:02:00,295
Speaker 5:  malicious compliance. Apple is on the record over and over in the

1045
01:02:00,295 --> 01:02:03,255
Speaker 5:  Google antitrust case and elsewhere for saying that it hates choice screens.

1046
01:02:03,355 --> 01:02:06,935
Speaker 5:  And it is now required to have a choice screen asking what browser

1047
01:02:07,155 --> 01:02:10,895
Speaker 5:  do you want to use as your default browser on your iPhone? And when you upgrade

1048
01:02:10,915 --> 01:02:14,015
Speaker 5:  to iOS 17.4 in the EU that you will get that

1049
01:02:14,805 --> 01:02:18,575
Speaker 5:  this screen is ugly, it's unhelpful. It takes you to the app store

1050
01:02:18,595 --> 01:02:21,605
Speaker 5:  in a really confusing way. It includes a bunch of browsers no one's ever

1051
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:25,485
Speaker 5:  heard of. It's just not good. And, and like it's

1052
01:02:25,485 --> 01:02:28,645
Speaker 5:  very clear that Apple has no investment in making it good. And they're like,

1053
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:31,125
Speaker 5:  well you're making us do this dumb thing. We're gonna do it in the dumbest

1054
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:34,445
Speaker 5:  way we can think of that is very hard to fight

1055
01:02:34,995 --> 01:02:38,325
Speaker 5:  that. Like, that argument is hard to prove that that's what's happening.

1056
01:02:38,325 --> 01:02:41,125
Speaker 5:  It's very obvious that that's what's happening. But this thing where it's

1057
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:45,005
Speaker 5:  like, oh, you, you claimed to be opening up

1058
01:02:45,005 --> 01:02:48,085
Speaker 5:  the app store because that is what by law we are requiring you to do. And

1059
01:02:48,085 --> 01:02:51,645
Speaker 5:  now you are just eventually shutting down the biggest,

1060
01:02:51,955 --> 01:02:55,525
Speaker 5:  loudest player that wants to do this. Just

1061
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:59,765
Speaker 5:  feels like a bad call. Yeah. I think

1062
01:02:59,895 --> 01:03:03,685
Speaker 5:  Apple making it really, really hard and arduous to open a third party

1063
01:03:03,785 --> 01:03:07,405
Speaker 5:  app store is in a certain way very clever. I think it's, it's,

1064
01:03:07,675 --> 01:03:11,605
Speaker 5:  it's conniving and it's cynical, but it's very clever for a company

1065
01:03:11,605 --> 01:03:15,405
Speaker 5:  that has a lot to protect in that space. To just pick

1066
01:03:15,405 --> 01:03:19,325
Speaker 5:  this fight with Epic again over and over and just kick it out and

1067
01:03:19,485 --> 01:03:22,725
Speaker 5:  threaten to have all of this come back at you just seems dumb. Yeah. I just

1068
01:03:22,725 --> 01:03:23,085
Speaker 5:  don't get it.

1069
01:03:23,365 --> 01:03:27,205
Speaker 6:  I feel like it's, it's a company who is seeing their, their power

1070
01:03:27,395 --> 01:03:30,245
Speaker 6:  wane in this marketplace, right? They're, they're seeing it happen really

1071
01:03:30,245 --> 01:03:34,205
Speaker 6:  quickly and they have to assert they're dominance.

1072
01:03:35,035 --> 01:03:38,085
Speaker 6:  Like they have to show everybody, no, we're the boss, we still control it.

1073
01:03:38,085 --> 01:03:40,725
Speaker 6:  Right? Like Spotify, you start mouthing off like this,

1074
01:03:41,915 --> 01:03:45,445
Speaker 6:  that what ha that's what happens to you. And that's

1075
01:03:45,835 --> 01:03:49,725
Speaker 6:  certainly like a take, that's a thing you can do. Plenty of businesses have

1076
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:53,645
Speaker 6:  played that kind of hardball, but very

1077
01:03:53,645 --> 01:03:57,405
Speaker 6:  few that are so consumer facing and, and really dependent on

1078
01:03:57,805 --> 01:04:01,445
Speaker 6:  consumer goodwill in a way that Apple is very much dependent on. Like,

1079
01:04:01,945 --> 01:04:05,885
Speaker 6:  you know, we have to deal with our, our ISPs even that we hate them.

1080
01:04:05,995 --> 01:04:09,525
Speaker 6:  They're some of the most hated companies in the United States, but we have

1081
01:04:09,525 --> 01:04:13,445
Speaker 6:  to deal with them because they're monopolies. And this is

1082
01:04:13,485 --> 01:04:16,925
Speaker 6:  a very common reaction of a monopoly is to be like, okay, if you're gonna

1083
01:04:16,925 --> 01:04:20,485
Speaker 6:  fight our monopoly, if you're gonna try to counter our monopoly, we're gonna

1084
01:04:20,515 --> 01:04:24,125
Speaker 6:  like grind you into dust repeatedly. And

1085
01:04:25,065 --> 01:04:28,925
Speaker 6:  you shouldn't probably do that if you're someone like Apple

1086
01:04:29,105 --> 01:04:32,845
Speaker 6:  who is a monopoly on the App store but isn't necessarily like

1087
01:04:33,205 --> 01:04:36,605
Speaker 6:  a monopoly in a lot of other places. Like you can go buy a Samsung phone,

1088
01:04:36,705 --> 01:04:40,645
Speaker 6:  you can go buy a Google Pixel, you can just not use Apple

1089
01:04:40,645 --> 01:04:41,725
Speaker 6:  products eventually.

1090
01:04:42,225 --> 01:04:45,645
Speaker 4:  The best thing you can do when you're a monopoly is not act like one. And

1091
01:04:45,645 --> 01:04:49,245
Speaker 4:  I feel like Apple won learn that lesson like a, a very,

1092
01:04:50,115 --> 01:04:53,205
Speaker 4:  like, you know, Microsoft when they were the death star,

1093
01:04:54,115 --> 01:04:58,085
Speaker 4:  they acted like, you know Yeah. And they got in a lot of trouble. And

1094
01:04:58,085 --> 01:05:01,885
Speaker 4:  like, you know why Chrome has way more market share than ie. It's

1095
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:06,175
Speaker 4:  'cause Microsoft got himself in a lot of trouble and the sources stop

1096
01:05:06,455 --> 01:05:09,935
Speaker 4:  bundling IE with Windows like that. That's a real thing. Like that was the

1097
01:05:09,935 --> 01:05:13,775
Speaker 4:  antitrust case and it's because Microsoft went and killed Netscape with a

1098
01:05:13,775 --> 01:05:16,895
Speaker 4:  bunch of moves just like this. And I, I worry

1099
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:21,245
Speaker 4:  all the time with the modern apple that the people

1100
01:05:21,545 --> 01:05:25,325
Speaker 4:  who are coming into the company, the people who work there,

1101
01:05:25,395 --> 01:05:29,325
Speaker 4:  like, you know, this company's been around for a long time. They have only

1102
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:33,205
Speaker 4:  worked at the Apple that is this Apple and

1103
01:05:33,205 --> 01:05:36,965
Speaker 4:  the people who built it from the underdog apple or

1104
01:05:37,025 --> 01:05:39,245
Speaker 4:  you know, they're just getting older. It's just like time to retire. There's

1105
01:05:39,245 --> 01:05:42,725
Speaker 4:  been a wave of departures from Apple recently reported all over the place

1106
01:05:43,025 --> 01:05:45,725
Speaker 4:  and you're just like, oh, If, you walk around

1107
01:05:46,755 --> 01:05:50,365
Speaker 4:  like you're that thing and you're not, you don't have that little like chip

1108
01:05:50,365 --> 01:05:53,085
Speaker 4:  on your shoulder. You gotta earn it from consumers, right? Like you've gotta

1109
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:57,045
Speaker 4:  take one piece of market share away from Windows every single day, which

1110
01:05:57,045 --> 01:06:00,485
Speaker 4:  is what the version of Apple that became this thing came from.

1111
01:06:01,235 --> 01:06:04,805
Speaker 4:  Like, you are just gonna act like a bully. Yep. 'cause you have no conception

1112
01:06:04,805 --> 01:06:08,725
Speaker 4:  of when you weren't. And I think the flip side of that is consumers,

1113
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:12,045
Speaker 4:  a lot of newer, younger consumers do not

1114
01:06:13,055 --> 01:06:16,705
Speaker 4:  have any recollection at all of Apple on the come up.

1115
01:06:16,995 --> 01:06:20,585
Speaker 4:  Right. Of that incredible run of Apple just sort of like creating product

1116
01:06:20,585 --> 01:06:24,105
Speaker 4:  after product that revolutionized industry after industry. They're like,

1117
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:27,905
Speaker 4:  yep, we grow up, we get a phone, my parents put a watch on me. So I can leave

1118
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:31,065
Speaker 4:  the house without, right? So they can track me everywhere. Like my friends

1119
01:06:31,265 --> 01:06:33,865
Speaker 4:  are all on iMessage and they bully people with green belt. And it's like,

1120
01:06:34,325 --> 01:06:38,185
Speaker 4:  yo, there's no like long history of Goodwill here. There's just

1121
01:06:38,575 --> 01:06:38,865
Speaker 4:  this.

1122
01:06:40,425 --> 01:06:43,385
Speaker 4:  Right? And it's like, I can't get Fortnite on my phone 'cause these two billionaires

1123
01:06:43,385 --> 01:06:47,335
Speaker 4:  are fighting. And I, like I said, I I will just, I'll end it here.

1124
01:06:47,335 --> 01:06:50,695
Speaker 4:  We, we talked about Reregulation for a long time. People are gonna email

1125
01:06:50,695 --> 01:06:53,615
Speaker 4:  us. They're gonna talk to me about Apple's business model and how much money

1126
01:06:53,645 --> 01:06:57,415
Speaker 4:  they make and stock price. I get all the, whenever we criticize Google, people

1127
01:06:57,415 --> 01:07:01,135
Speaker 4:  are like, I bet you, I dare you to short Google. I I can't, we

1128
01:07:01,275 --> 01:07:04,495
Speaker 4:  we cannot buy the stock. We cannot do that. And I will just remind you of

1129
01:07:04,495 --> 01:07:07,935
Speaker 4:  a quote that I think about maybe once a week. It's in a wired profile

1130
01:07:08,435 --> 01:07:12,175
Speaker 4:  of Walt Mossberg walking through the CES show floor. And he had just written

1131
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:15,175
Speaker 4:  a bad review. This is a true story. He had just written a bad review of like

1132
01:07:15,195 --> 01:07:19,055
Speaker 4:  the serious radio when it had first come out. And the CEO of Sirius

1133
01:07:19,055 --> 01:07:22,775
Speaker 4:  started yelling at Walt Mossberg on the show floor of CES. And he said, you

1134
01:07:22,775 --> 01:07:25,895
Speaker 4:  brought our stock price down. And Walt Mossberg looked at him dead in the

1135
01:07:25,895 --> 01:07:29,375
Speaker 4:  eye and said, I don't give a fuck about your stock price. And

1136
01:07:29,515 --> 01:07:33,495
Speaker 4:  that's it. Like, I don't care about the richest company in the world

1137
01:07:33,495 --> 01:07:36,815
Speaker 4:  making more or less money where their stock price goes. I care. Like, are

1138
01:07:36,815 --> 01:07:40,335
Speaker 4:  we getting more interesting innovative products? Are we building cooler

1139
01:07:40,335 --> 01:07:43,895
Speaker 4:  experiences for people? Do I feel like when I spend my money as a consumer,

1140
01:07:44,325 --> 01:07:48,255
Speaker 4:  I've done it in a way that feels good and healthy. I don't know

1141
01:07:48,255 --> 01:07:51,815
Speaker 4:  if these regulations are gonna achieve that. I dunno if Apple's compliance

1142
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:55,735
Speaker 4:  or malicious compliance will achieve that. I have no idea. I do know that

1143
01:07:55,745 --> 01:07:59,255
Speaker 4:  right now, the way it has been going, our choices are getting smaller and

1144
01:07:59,255 --> 01:08:02,935
Speaker 4:  smaller and smaller and more and more of the dollars are flowing to Apple

1145
01:08:02,935 --> 01:08:06,735
Speaker 4:  instead of app developers. And that feels weird. So like I'm all

1146
01:08:06,735 --> 01:08:09,375
Speaker 4:  for flipping the table and everyone can have their feelings, but I would

1147
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:13,135
Speaker 4:  just caution Apple in particular acting like this

1148
01:08:13,135 --> 01:08:16,405
Speaker 4:  right now does not get you the goodwill so that the next time you're like,

1149
01:08:16,445 --> 01:08:18,765
Speaker 4:  I think all of you should rewrite your apps in a different language that

1150
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:22,565
Speaker 4:  we invented, people aren't gonna do it. And that's where the power

1151
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:23,085
Speaker 4:  comes from.

1152
01:08:23,345 --> 01:08:26,645
Speaker 5:  You know what I've been thinking about a lot recently is Apple Pay, which

1153
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:30,525
Speaker 5:  yeah, I think Apple Pay on the iPhone is like essentially a

1154
01:08:30,525 --> 01:08:33,965
Speaker 5:  perfect product. And the way they've integrated it into

1155
01:08:33,965 --> 01:08:37,485
Speaker 5:  websites, so that like, like for me it's, it's takeout food over and over,

1156
01:08:37,485 --> 01:08:40,725
Speaker 5:  right? Where I'm like, I'm on a website, I'm, I'm ordering and my options

1157
01:08:40,725 --> 01:08:44,685
Speaker 5:  are either spend eight minutes entering my contact information, which I

1158
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:48,365
Speaker 5:  can do, but it's 12 fields and I have to go get my credit card and remember

1159
01:08:48,365 --> 01:08:51,645
Speaker 5:  what it is. Or I tap the button that says Apple Pay, I double click on the

1160
01:08:51,645 --> 01:08:55,005
Speaker 5:  side, it scans my face and I've paid for dinner. That is, that is winning

1161
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:58,765
Speaker 5:  with product in an open ecosystem and it kicks ass. And it is like, that

1162
01:08:58,765 --> 01:09:02,685
Speaker 5:  is Apple at its best. The opposite of that is this

1163
01:09:02,685 --> 01:09:06,605
Speaker 5:  fight that Apple is in about all the Anti steering stuff and the $2 billion

1164
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:10,445
Speaker 5:  fine that just came from the EU about all the Spotify stuff, which

1165
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:14,445
Speaker 5:  is Apple saying you are not allowed to tell people the other places they

1166
01:09:14,445 --> 01:09:18,205
Speaker 5:  can go pay for your stuff. And for years with Apple Music was

1167
01:09:18,205 --> 01:09:22,045
Speaker 5:  preferencing Apple Music. Apple Music was allowed to have ads and

1168
01:09:22,045 --> 01:09:25,285
Speaker 5:  notifications that Spotify and others are not allowed to have. And that is

1169
01:09:25,285 --> 01:09:29,165
Speaker 5:  the opposite of winning with product that is saying, we are going

1170
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:33,085
Speaker 5:  to prevent you from doing anything, including save your customers

1171
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:37,045
Speaker 5:  money because we can. And and to me it's like I I

1172
01:09:37,045 --> 01:09:40,845
Speaker 5:  wanna see the Apple Pay Apple and not the Apple Music.

1173
01:09:40,855 --> 01:09:41,965
Speaker 5:  Apple can I because

1174
01:09:41,965 --> 01:09:45,125
Speaker 4:  That can, I was can I go, can I tell you story about Apple Pay?

1175
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:47,425
Speaker 4:  Yes, please. I,

1176
01:09:49,175 --> 01:09:51,665
Speaker 4:  over the weekend, this is like what happens when you're the editor chief

1177
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:54,825
Speaker 4:  attack website. I went to pay with Apple Pay and it didn't work. Mm. Right.

1178
01:09:54,885 --> 01:09:58,425
Speaker 4:  My credit card got declined and I was like, this is weird. And I called the

1179
01:09:58,425 --> 01:10:02,105
Speaker 4:  bank and the bank was like, apple Pay is having an

1180
01:10:02,105 --> 01:10:06,025
Speaker 4:  unexpected upgrade, which is an incredible euphemism, like

1181
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:08,505
Speaker 4:  an absolutely incredible euphemism. It

1182
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:09,265
Speaker 5:  Broke in a cool way.

1183
01:10:10,565 --> 01:10:13,905
Speaker 4:  So I was like, that's weird. And I posted on threads about it, like, is anybody

1184
01:10:13,905 --> 01:10:16,625
Speaker 4:  else having problems with Chase? And a lot of people got back to me like,

1185
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:20,025
Speaker 4:  this is broken for me all day. It's like email Apple, it's the weekend email

1186
01:10:20,025 --> 01:10:22,145
Speaker 4:  Apple. I say, Hey, is Apple play broken? I'm just gonna write story this

1187
01:10:22,145 --> 01:10:25,585
Speaker 4:  down. And it took a minute 'cause it's a weekend fine.

1188
01:10:25,965 --> 01:10:29,545
Speaker 4:  And they got back to me and they Apple, you can read the story. Apple basically

1189
01:10:29,545 --> 01:10:32,625
Speaker 4:  was like, this is Chase's fault. It's not Apple Pays fault. And I was like,

1190
01:10:32,835 --> 01:10:36,705
Speaker 4:  great, you know, apple Pay doesn't work, right? Like it doesn't

1191
01:10:36,705 --> 01:10:40,425
Speaker 4:  matter to anyone whose fault it is it, what matters is that Apple, like people

1192
01:10:40,425 --> 01:10:43,065
Speaker 4:  are trying to pay with their phones, it's not working. And they're like,

1193
01:10:43,065 --> 01:10:46,185
Speaker 4:  yeah, but it's Chase's fault. And I was like, cool. Like

1194
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:50,625
Speaker 4:  cool. Like I, I will, I will happily write that down, you know, but

1195
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,505
Speaker 4:  here's the information I can give you. Have you thought about updating your

1196
01:10:53,505 --> 01:10:56,505
Speaker 4:  status page to say it's Chase's fault? Like it's, this is what people are

1197
01:10:56,825 --> 01:10:59,665
Speaker 4:  reacting to, this is the information you can give them. And the idea that

1198
01:10:59,665 --> 01:11:03,065
Speaker 4:  Apple had a dependency on one of the largest

1199
01:11:03,295 --> 01:11:06,665
Speaker 4:  financial institutions in the world and they were like, but blame them.

1200
01:11:07,345 --> 01:11:11,305
Speaker 4:  Right? When it's like, but the but what people are holding is a phone that

1201
01:11:11,405 --> 01:11:15,265
Speaker 4:  has your logo on it, you know, and it's like when at and t goes

1202
01:11:15,295 --> 01:11:18,745
Speaker 4:  down, people don't blame Apple, they blame at and t you're very happy for

1203
01:11:18,745 --> 01:11:22,145
Speaker 4:  that. Like that's fine. Like people understand these relationships. But at

1204
01:11:22,145 --> 01:11:24,825
Speaker 4:  the end of the day, like you are responsible for the products and like that

1205
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:28,705
Speaker 4:  thing where Apple Pay ISN ant almost perfect product because Apple has

1206
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:32,425
Speaker 4:  managed all these relationships for you. That's what I mean by the

1207
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:36,385
Speaker 4:  hubris. Like yeah Apple's like it's not our fault. And it's like,

1208
01:11:36,385 --> 01:11:39,825
Speaker 4:  no, it's your product, right? Let's, it's your magic, right? Like you are

1209
01:11:39,825 --> 01:11:42,425
Speaker 4:  the ones who made this almost perfect product and you're pissed that you

1210
01:11:42,425 --> 01:11:45,585
Speaker 4:  have a dependency on someone else. And you would prefer Apple in particular

1211
01:11:45,605 --> 01:11:49,105
Speaker 4:  is famous for preferring to have no dependencies on anyone at any time. Yeah.

1212
01:11:49,365 --> 01:11:52,785
Speaker 4:  And I get it because I would love to have no dependencies on it. But then

1213
01:11:52,785 --> 01:11:56,505
Speaker 4:  you look at some of the moves like this web app stuff, right? Where they,

1214
01:11:56,725 --> 01:11:59,945
Speaker 4:  the DMA, they said we're going to disallow web apps because we think we have

1215
01:11:59,945 --> 01:12:02,745
Speaker 4:  to allow other browser engines. And people said, no, no, no. Like the EU

1216
01:12:02,745 --> 01:12:04,865
Speaker 4:  got a little weird and Apple said, okay, we'll have web apps again and we'll

1217
01:12:04,865 --> 01:12:08,745
Speaker 4:  just do it this way. I will just remind everyone that the reason

1218
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:12,625
Speaker 4:  Apple exists today at all is because Steve Jobs could

1219
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:16,225
Speaker 4:  do the iMac and tell people they could get on the internet. And the only

1220
01:12:16,225 --> 01:12:19,465
Speaker 4:  reason that was a viable thing to say was because what people wanted was

1221
01:12:19,465 --> 01:12:22,665
Speaker 4:  web browsers. Yep. And so the web browser on the iMac was

1222
01:12:22,735 --> 01:12:26,625
Speaker 4:  approximately the same as the web browser on Windows. And so

1223
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:29,985
Speaker 4:  he could sell you an iMac instead. If he had been like, well you can use

1224
01:12:29,985 --> 01:12:33,065
Speaker 4:  here as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft could have just turned off Apple. They

1225
01:12:33,065 --> 01:12:36,225
Speaker 4:  could have turned off the business, but because of the internet, like the

1226
01:12:36,225 --> 01:12:39,865
Speaker 4:  open application architecture of the internet, he was able to sell Mac

1227
01:12:40,115 --> 01:12:43,305
Speaker 4:  again. And it's weird now for Apple to be at the point where they're like,

1228
01:12:43,455 --> 01:12:46,865
Speaker 4:  what if we don't have an open application architecture?

1229
01:12:47,195 --> 01:12:50,945
Speaker 4:  Right? And like that's weird. Like that's where you came from. The company

1230
01:12:50,945 --> 01:12:54,865
Speaker 4:  would've not made it out of nine the 1990s if

1231
01:12:54,885 --> 01:12:58,745
Speaker 4:  not for that. And I, I just, I don't know how to like underline for people

1232
01:12:58,745 --> 01:13:02,635
Speaker 4:  like a lot of audiences young, but these things are

1233
01:13:02,735 --> 01:13:06,595
Speaker 4:  not new. Like these moves are old moves and

1234
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:09,635
Speaker 4:  it's just weird for Apple, which is a company built out of some of these

1235
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:13,485
Speaker 4:  changes a long time ago to be making the same mistakes.

1236
01:13:13,825 --> 01:13:17,605
Speaker 4:  Yep. We'll see. Agreed. We'll see there's a chance that this should just

1237
01:13:17,605 --> 01:13:19,965
Speaker 4:  result in a bunch of like weird Europeans talking about how much better there

1238
01:13:19,965 --> 01:13:21,045
Speaker 4:  are, like 15 browsers are.

1239
01:13:22,325 --> 01:13:25,125
Speaker 5:  I also think it's possible this results in nothing. Like I think, I think

1240
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:29,005
Speaker 5:  what Apple clearly wants to change is nothing. And I think you're gonna get

1241
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:32,965
Speaker 5:  a bunch of people who like accidentally set Ecosia as their default browser

1242
01:13:33,065 --> 01:13:35,805
Speaker 5:  for 10 minutes and then they go back to Spotify and nothing at all changes.

1243
01:13:35,915 --> 01:13:39,485
Speaker 4:  Well, no, here's my real question. The, the one thing that could change that

1244
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:43,205
Speaker 4:  'cause choice screens have not worked in Europe, right? Like right famously

1245
01:13:43,625 --> 01:13:47,205
Speaker 4:  in one of our pieces about it, we linked to a long analysis of where choice

1246
01:13:47,475 --> 01:13:51,245
Speaker 4:  screens came from and whether they work or not. But what has never happened

1247
01:13:51,785 --> 01:13:55,725
Speaker 4:  is you've never been able to pick Chrome. Right? That you, the

1248
01:13:55,725 --> 01:13:58,325
Speaker 4:  choice screen has always been designed to make you not pick Chrome.

1249
01:13:58,715 --> 01:14:01,285
Speaker 5:  Well it's been designed to make you pick a browser you've never heard of

1250
01:14:01,345 --> 01:14:04,245
Speaker 5:  or the only one you've heard of. In this case there are at least two you've

1251
01:14:04,245 --> 01:14:04,325
Speaker 5:  heard

1252
01:14:04,325 --> 01:14:08,045
Speaker 4:  Of. There's Safari and Chrome. So the idea that people will pick Chrome is

1253
01:14:08,325 --> 01:14:11,685
Speaker 4:  actually fascinating. I'm dying to see what happens there. Alright. I don't,

1254
01:14:11,685 --> 01:14:13,965
Speaker 4:  I don't know what's gonna happen or anything else but the, the Chrome versus

1255
01:14:14,285 --> 01:14:17,325
Speaker 4:  safari and choice screen that seems really interesting. It could

1256
01:15:03,945 --> 01:15:05,895
Speaker 4:  We're back, we're out the Eurozone,

1257
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:08,865
Speaker 5:  We made it, we landed in America.

1258
01:15:09,525 --> 01:15:12,585
Speaker 4:  We landed in America where we're gonna talk about Elon Musk and pickup trucks

1259
01:15:12,725 --> 01:15:16,385
Speaker 4:  in short order. That's really gonna happen here. Alright, we gotta make this

1260
01:15:16,385 --> 01:15:19,905
Speaker 4:  lightning round quick. We went on too long. This show is too long. But wait,

1261
01:15:19,905 --> 01:15:21,425
Speaker 4:  do we have a sponsor for the lightning round?

1262
01:15:21,945 --> 01:15:22,865
Speaker 5:  I don't think so. Sony

1263
01:15:22,865 --> 01:15:26,745
Speaker 4:  Bravia Corps, Sony, that's not, that's all Sony has to

1264
01:15:26,745 --> 01:15:30,545
Speaker 4:  pay the money to sponsor the Lightning. Other people don't pay.

1265
01:15:30,545 --> 01:15:34,265
Speaker 4:  But if you're a big company, you're, if the European Union has designated

1266
01:15:34,265 --> 01:15:37,905
Speaker 4:  you a gatekeeper, you have to pay money to sponsor the lightning round. All

1267
01:15:37,905 --> 01:15:38,585
Speaker 4:  right, David, what you got?

1268
01:15:38,855 --> 01:15:42,665
Speaker 5:  Okay, I have two, which is a good start. One is very fast, which is just

1269
01:15:42,665 --> 01:15:46,585
Speaker 5:  that there are now transcriptions in Apple podcasts. Yes. For

1270
01:15:46,845 --> 01:15:50,625
Speaker 5:  all of its shows including The, Vergecast. Sometimes they're very wrong in

1271
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:54,585
Speaker 5:  very funny ways, but it's actually a great feature. You can

1272
01:15:54,585 --> 01:15:58,065
Speaker 5:  like tap on a paragraph and it'll take you to that part of the show. You

1273
01:15:58,065 --> 01:16:00,505
Speaker 5:  can, it's a great way to go back and be like, what was that thing I missed

1274
01:16:00,505 --> 01:16:04,385
Speaker 5:  without actually having to like scan back 15 seconds in the show? It's just

1275
01:16:04,385 --> 01:16:08,225
Speaker 5:  an awesome feature. I am not an Apple Podcast fan in general, but it

1276
01:16:08,225 --> 01:16:10,825
Speaker 5:  is like I'm, I'm tempted back to it because of it.

1277
01:16:12,175 --> 01:16:15,585
Speaker 5:  It's just a cool thing. So If, you make a podcast app, do transcripts, it's

1278
01:16:15,585 --> 01:16:18,945
Speaker 5:  great. And also don't yell at us for things that get wrong in the transcripts

1279
01:16:18,945 --> 01:16:22,825
Speaker 5:  because they're not our transcripts. But my real one is story Sean

1280
01:16:22,825 --> 01:16:25,665
Speaker 5:  Hollister's been covering a bunch this week. That is something we talked

1281
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:29,185
Speaker 5:  about a bunch on The Vergecast last year, which is Game emulators. So there's

1282
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:32,545
Speaker 5:  this emulator called Yuzu that was for emulating

1283
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:35,745
Speaker 5:  Nintendo Switch games and basically

1284
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:39,945
Speaker 5:  Nintendo picked a fight and Yuzu just

1285
01:16:39,955 --> 01:16:43,905
Speaker 5:  caved. Yeah. And this has been the thing that a lot of the folks

1286
01:16:43,905 --> 01:16:46,545
Speaker 5:  in the emulator community have worried about for a long time, which is that

1287
01:16:46,705 --> 01:16:49,705
Speaker 5:  emulators are very popular and kind of

1288
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,585
Speaker 5:  just unproblematic enough that it has not been

1289
01:16:54,585 --> 01:16:58,105
Speaker 5:  worth it for the game companies to pick this fight. But Yuzu kind of crossed

1290
01:16:58,105 --> 01:17:01,105
Speaker 5:  that threshold for a couple of interesting reasons. People were using it

1291
01:17:01,105 --> 01:17:04,505
Speaker 5:  to play unreleased games. So it got the kind of

1292
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:08,985
Speaker 5:  press and attention from these companies that you don't typically get. And

1293
01:17:09,315 --> 01:17:12,485
Speaker 5:  basically what it sounds like happened is Nintendo just showed up and was

1294
01:17:12,485 --> 01:17:16,285
Speaker 5:  like, we will crush you to death. And they said, okay, we're shut down

1295
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:19,525
Speaker 5:  and took all their stuff offline. They, they shut down the discord, they've

1296
01:17:19,525 --> 01:17:22,565
Speaker 5:  been doing stuff and it has had this real like immediate chilling effect

1297
01:17:23,065 --> 01:17:26,365
Speaker 5:  on emulators all over the place. There are folks shutting down Discords,

1298
01:17:26,365 --> 01:17:30,205
Speaker 5:  there are folks saying you can't talk about emulation

1299
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:34,365
Speaker 5:  here because of the legal repercussions that we're worried about. And it,

1300
01:17:34,425 --> 01:17:38,085
Speaker 5:  it just literally took Nintendo picking one

1301
01:17:38,435 --> 01:17:41,685
Speaker 5:  loud fight with one company and all of a sudden it feels like this whole

1302
01:17:41,885 --> 01:17:43,725
Speaker 5:  emulator world is kind of in peril. Which is

1303
01:17:44,115 --> 01:17:48,085
Speaker 6:  Kind of weird because yuzu like I had it

1304
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:51,685
Speaker 6:  on my steam deck. I maybe I I own a, I own a a

1305
01:17:51,685 --> 01:17:54,005
Speaker 6:  Nintendo Switch. I feel totally morally

1306
01:17:54,155 --> 01:17:55,325
Speaker 4:  Notable Plex user

1307
01:17:56,595 --> 01:17:56,885
Speaker 6:  With

1308
01:17:56,885 --> 01:17:59,285
Speaker 4:  My Choices has the emulator on her steam deck. Yeah.

1309
01:17:59,285 --> 01:18:02,645
Speaker 6:  Who, who knew? but it was always kind of a weird one because generally emulators

1310
01:18:02,755 --> 01:18:06,565
Speaker 6:  only emulate older systems. So like it

1311
01:18:06,565 --> 01:18:10,045
Speaker 6:  doesn't emulate the PS five, it emulates the PS four or whatever. And

1312
01:18:10,165 --> 01:18:13,805
Speaker 6:  Nintendo, because of the switch architecture was really, really easy to

1313
01:18:14,005 --> 01:18:17,565
Speaker 6:  emulate. And it has been since the, we, it's just been like super, super

1314
01:18:17,675 --> 01:18:21,045
Speaker 6:  easy to emulate and people just started getting more

1315
01:18:21,135 --> 01:18:24,845
Speaker 6:  aggressive with that. And it's like, yeah, if, if I can go download the

1316
01:18:24,845 --> 01:18:28,445
Speaker 6:  unreleased metro game and play it on my steam deck,

1317
01:18:28,795 --> 01:18:32,605
Speaker 6:  that probably is actually a pro. Like I,

1318
01:18:32,805 --> 01:18:35,805
Speaker 6:  I was kind of when that happened, I was like, isn't Nintendo gonna come down

1319
01:18:35,805 --> 01:18:39,685
Speaker 6:  like a bag of bricks on them? Because that's not how emulators have worked

1320
01:18:39,865 --> 01:18:43,765
Speaker 6:  for the last 30 years. And yeah, they they

1321
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:46,085
Speaker 6:  did in fact come down like a bag of bricks on YouTube

1322
01:18:46,225 --> 01:18:50,205
Speaker 5:  But also If you wanted to make that same case about a 20-year-old

1323
01:18:50,205 --> 01:18:53,765
Speaker 5:  Mario game. It's just as true. Yeah. It's just that it's such a smaller,

1324
01:18:53,915 --> 01:18:57,845
Speaker 5:  less interesting business for Nintendo that it's better

1325
01:18:57,945 --> 01:19:00,885
Speaker 5:  off just leaving well enough alone and let the people who wanna play these

1326
01:19:00,885 --> 01:19:04,405
Speaker 5:  old games who are then probably likely to come by the new games do so. Right.

1327
01:19:04,405 --> 01:19:08,205
Speaker 5:  Like it's, it's this very sketchy but sort of workable balance.

1328
01:19:08,345 --> 01:19:11,365
Speaker 5:  And I, I do agree. I think Yuzu did something slightly different to Trip

1329
01:19:11,365 --> 01:19:14,725
Speaker 6:  Over because it was a current thing. It was current games. 'cause even like

1330
01:19:14,725 --> 01:19:18,365
Speaker 6:  the three Ds emulator they had was, it was just,

1331
01:19:18,585 --> 01:19:21,845
Speaker 6:  you know, not as many people are paying a, playing a three Ds nowadays. Totally.

1332
01:19:22,065 --> 01:19:25,965
Speaker 6:  Or like, there's a really good one called Dolphin for, for we games

1333
01:19:26,105 --> 01:19:30,005
Speaker 6:  and, and Game Cube games. And that's a 20-year-old system that's that's that's

1334
01:19:30,005 --> 01:19:33,885
Speaker 6:  different than like I can just go buy a bunch, get a bunch of unreleased

1335
01:19:33,885 --> 01:19:37,645
Speaker 6:  games on a torrent site and play them on my steam deck and never play Nintendo

1336
01:19:37,685 --> 01:19:41,285
Speaker 6:  a dime right now. Like how would you know, like how would you know that Alex

1337
01:19:41,285 --> 01:19:42,725
Speaker 6:  that's, that's just piracy. Like

1338
01:19:42,725 --> 01:19:44,205
Speaker 4:  That's just, why do you, why do you know that information?

1339
01:19:44,525 --> 01:19:47,165
Speaker 6:  I have no idea who I gotta go.

1340
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:50,725
Speaker 6:  I have no idea what's happening here. but it

1341
01:19:50,725 --> 01:19:52,525
Speaker 5:  Was always like, you're in Texas. There are no laws there. Yeah. There are

1342
01:19:52,525 --> 01:19:52,605
Speaker 5:  no

1343
01:19:52,605 --> 01:19:55,245
Speaker 6:  Laws here in Texas. We don't do regulations here.

1344
01:19:55,865 --> 01:19:58,925
Speaker 4:  Here's what we do. We roll cold and we play unreleased natural games.

1345
01:20:01,585 --> 01:20:01,805
Speaker 4:  but

1346
01:20:01,805 --> 01:20:05,725
Speaker 6:  It was, it was all the Jesus thing was always wild. I'm I'm, I wish it didn't

1347
01:20:05,725 --> 01:20:09,285
Speaker 6:  have such a chilling effect on the emulator community 'cause like emulators

1348
01:20:09,345 --> 01:20:12,965
Speaker 6:  are sick and I still want somebody to make a good N 64

1349
01:20:13,205 --> 01:20:17,125
Speaker 6:  emulator, which is still a weird challenge. But

1350
01:20:17,425 --> 01:20:20,645
Speaker 5:  We think analog is up to something I'm hoping. Oh my

1351
01:20:20,645 --> 01:20:23,405
Speaker 4:  God. Oh right. They did, they did, they did the tease out thing. I will say,

1352
01:20:23,945 --> 01:20:27,405
Speaker 4:  you know, the trope at The Verge is that copyright law is the only law on

1353
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:30,645
Speaker 4:  the internet. 'cause it's the only thing that can stop anyone from doing

1354
01:20:30,845 --> 01:20:34,325
Speaker 4:  anything for some reason. Well the reason is first matter, but copyright

1355
01:20:34,325 --> 01:20:38,165
Speaker 4:  law is the only law on the internet. And here I think there's,

1356
01:20:38,745 --> 01:20:41,605
Speaker 4:  we still don't know the answer. Right. It's like actually kind of fascinating

1357
01:20:41,605 --> 01:20:45,525
Speaker 4:  that they settled. 'cause what you get is people dunno if emulate

1358
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:49,525
Speaker 4:  are illegal or not. Some of 'em get taken to court. But usually the way the

1359
01:20:49,525 --> 01:20:52,885
Speaker 4:  cases are structured is you have a big rich corporation

1360
01:20:53,345 --> 01:20:54,725
Speaker 4:  and then an emulator,

1361
01:20:55,175 --> 01:20:58,405
Speaker 5:  Which is just like a handful of people in a GitHub. Right. It's like that's

1362
01:20:58,405 --> 01:20:59,245
Speaker 5:  the fight. Yeah. So the

1363
01:20:59,245 --> 01:21:02,845
Speaker 4:  Big huge corporation shows up and says, ah, we're gonna sue you.

1364
01:21:02,845 --> 01:21:06,045
Speaker 4:  That's gonna cost a lot of money. And that usually crushes the thing. Yep.

1365
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:09,965
Speaker 4:  It's the same in the fanfiction community actually. Like fanfiction is something

1366
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:13,845
Speaker 4:  that is sort of just tolerated by large publishing houses. There have

1367
01:21:13,845 --> 01:21:17,685
Speaker 4:  been a handful of cases, but like, it's bad. It's probably bad to piss off

1368
01:21:17,685 --> 01:21:21,525
Speaker 4:  the people who love your work so much that they're writing their own versions

1369
01:21:21,525 --> 01:21:25,485
Speaker 4:  of your work. Yeah. Like that, that's just like a bad move. So

1370
01:21:25,555 --> 01:21:29,085
Speaker 4:  it's like tolerated, but you could just stop it If you wanted to or you could

1371
01:21:29,085 --> 01:21:31,085
Speaker 4:  at least file a bunch of lawsuits and get everyone to spend a lot of money

1372
01:21:31,105 --> 01:21:34,645
Speaker 4:  and chill it out of existence. And I think here what you have is

1373
01:21:36,445 --> 01:21:39,805
Speaker 4:  Nintendo probably said, look, we can make your lives horrible.

1374
01:21:40,425 --> 01:21:43,565
Speaker 4:  We can cost you a lot of money and we will probably win because we can afford

1375
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,365
Speaker 4:  even more lawyers. And you and like Who knows what this, how outcome will

1376
01:21:46,365 --> 01:21:49,165
Speaker 4:  be. This could take years or you could just shut it down, pay us the money

1377
01:21:49,165 --> 01:21:53,045
Speaker 4:  and this will be over. And I, I I don't, I I

1378
01:21:53,405 --> 01:21:57,365
Speaker 4:  I feel conflicted about that. Right. Like that didn't get anyone to an answer.

1379
01:21:57,745 --> 01:22:01,285
Speaker 4:  The next stimulator can start. Right. There's no law against it. There's

1380
01:22:01,285 --> 01:22:04,685
Speaker 4:  no precedent saying it's illegal. Like you could probably take the source

1381
01:22:04,715 --> 01:22:08,605
Speaker 4:  code of yuzu today and start, start it all again. Yep. But these people

1382
01:22:08,735 --> 01:22:12,445
Speaker 4:  can't because they signed the, the settlement to make it go away. And I,

1383
01:22:12,725 --> 01:22:15,325
Speaker 4:  I just wonder like it some point,

1384
01:22:16,915 --> 01:22:20,855
Speaker 4:  the amount of DRM and protection and lockdowns and

1385
01:22:20,855 --> 01:22:24,455
Speaker 4:  stuff that is around all digital content is gonna run against

1386
01:22:25,035 --> 01:22:28,975
Speaker 4:  the reality that people are gonna build emulators. Right. And like,

1387
01:22:28,975 --> 01:22:32,735
Speaker 4:  we just haven't, we just haven't run the process to its end because

1388
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:35,695
Speaker 4:  the money has never been aligned to let us have the fight all the way to

1389
01:22:35,695 --> 01:22:35,895
Speaker 4:  the end.

1390
01:22:36,015 --> 01:22:39,895
Speaker 6:  Nintendo though has always been pretty consistent with like emulators versus

1391
01:22:40,135 --> 01:22:43,895
Speaker 6:  I guess piracy. Like, I think they think of those as two very different

1392
01:22:43,895 --> 01:22:46,935
Speaker 6:  things. And for a long time there was a, there's a lot of different ways

1393
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:50,935
Speaker 6:  you can pirate games on, on older Nintendo systems. They,

1394
01:22:50,935 --> 01:22:54,735
Speaker 6:  they did a lot of like these cartridges that you can go and you can put in

1395
01:22:54,735 --> 01:22:58,655
Speaker 6:  a system and they were really aggressive about stopping those. When, when

1396
01:22:58,655 --> 01:23:01,975
Speaker 6:  the three DS system had a pirate, like a little people were out there selling

1397
01:23:02,095 --> 01:23:05,765
Speaker 6:  a little SD card, you could put in a three DS and just pirate everything.

1398
01:23:06,085 --> 01:23:09,765
Speaker 6:  Nintendo was super aggressive about that. So like the user thing,

1399
01:23:10,205 --> 01:23:13,525
Speaker 6:  I know everybody's being like, what does this mean for the emulator community?

1400
01:23:13,585 --> 01:23:17,405
Speaker 6:  but it really was more, what does this mean for the game piracy

1401
01:23:17,515 --> 01:23:21,005
Speaker 6:  community? And that'll probably piss off a bunch of emulator people.

1402
01:23:21,485 --> 01:23:25,165
Speaker 4:  I do feel like there's a difference between selling atoms, like selling physical

1403
01:23:25,795 --> 01:23:29,405
Speaker 4:  Nintendos and like, it's a little bit hard, but you can figure it on software.

1404
01:23:29,465 --> 01:23:31,405
Speaker 4:  All right, Alex, what's your lightning round?

1405
01:23:31,705 --> 01:23:35,365
Speaker 6:  My lightning round is I wanna be really fiscally in irresponsible

1406
01:23:35,745 --> 01:23:39,405
Speaker 6:  and get the new Lenovo Legion go. It's $700. Yes.

1407
01:23:39,885 --> 01:23:43,645
Speaker 6:  I don't need it. Sean reviewed it. I want it so bad.

1408
01:23:44,315 --> 01:23:48,085
Speaker 6:  It's, it's windows, which means it's not as good

1409
01:23:48,225 --> 01:23:51,965
Speaker 6:  as the steam deck because the steam deck, the Steam Os is just superior.

1410
01:23:52,745 --> 01:23:55,845
Speaker 6:  But you can turn it into a tablet. You can take both of the, the handles

1411
01:23:55,845 --> 01:23:58,805
Speaker 6:  off and one of them you can then turn it into a mouse

1412
01:23:59,795 --> 01:24:03,485
Speaker 6:  like a vertical mouse. And that is just, that just rules. I just,

1413
01:24:04,465 --> 01:24:05,585
Speaker 6:  I want this thing so bad.

1414
01:24:05,895 --> 01:24:09,665
Speaker 5:  It's the gadget. Gadget. Yeah. We've covered in a while. I think where it

1415
01:24:09,665 --> 01:24:13,585
Speaker 5:  was like Lenovo was basically like, we are prevented for a variety of

1416
01:24:13,585 --> 01:24:17,225
Speaker 5:  reasons for making a really great handheld gaming thing

1417
01:24:17,225 --> 01:24:20,785
Speaker 5:  because you just kind of can't do that with Windows the way that it works

1418
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:24,625
Speaker 5:  now everybody agrees with that, including Microsoft. So we're just gonna

1419
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:28,345
Speaker 5:  do a bunch of weird fun stuff where you can flip

1420
01:24:28,345 --> 01:24:32,305
Speaker 5:  everything around and cool things happen. Is any of it any good?

1421
01:24:33,855 --> 01:24:37,785
Speaker 5:  Sometimes, but is it cool and rad and you're gonna want one

1422
01:24:37,785 --> 01:24:40,665
Speaker 5:  anyway? Like Yeah, yeah. You do. Yeah. And I do

1423
01:24:41,735 --> 01:24:42,025
Speaker 5:  like

1424
01:24:42,095 --> 01:24:42,865
Speaker 4:  This. This might

1425
01:24:43,115 --> 01:24:45,345
Speaker 5:  Might not be a good device, but I want it anyways.

1426
01:24:46,295 --> 01:24:47,425
Speaker 6:  Sean did give it six.

1427
01:24:48,085 --> 01:24:52,025
Speaker 4:  The everything old is new again. Vibes of this thing are

1428
01:24:52,025 --> 01:24:55,925
Speaker 4:  like, man, I've seen Microsoft try to shove windows

1429
01:24:56,025 --> 01:24:59,885
Speaker 4:  on a handheld in so many different ways and now it's like, yeah, it

1430
01:24:59,885 --> 01:25:03,325
Speaker 4:  rules now, you know, it's like fine,

1431
01:25:03,995 --> 01:25:06,765
Speaker 4:  fine. You want this little crap laptop, you can have it.

1432
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:08,805
Speaker 6:  And I want it.

1433
01:25:09,165 --> 01:25:12,085
Speaker 4:  I kinda love it. I love it. I love it. I can't say no.

1434
01:25:13,555 --> 01:25:17,525
Speaker 4:  Also, I love, Sean has a long history. Sean is one of our co-founders. He

1435
01:25:17,525 --> 01:25:21,245
Speaker 4:  has a long history here at The Verge of extremely

1436
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:22,365
Speaker 4:  like

1437
01:25:24,065 --> 01:25:27,755
Speaker 4:  just Sean photo choices. There's no adjective describing except Sean

1438
01:25:28,135 --> 01:25:31,835
Speaker 4:  in here. It's like the, it's a Windows handheld is obviously being

1439
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:34,835
Speaker 4:  photographed in a chair outside. They're beautiful photos. They're very good.

1440
01:25:35,295 --> 01:25:39,275
Speaker 4:  But like only the mind of Sean Hollister can produce these images. They're

1441
01:25:39,275 --> 01:25:39,755
Speaker 5:  Beautiful. I love

1442
01:25:39,755 --> 01:25:43,595
Speaker 4:  It. It's very good. It's very, you should go read it. It's, and it's a fun

1443
01:25:43,595 --> 01:25:47,545
Speaker 4:  read. All right, here's my lightning round. It's our boy Elon

1444
01:25:47,545 --> 01:25:50,745
Speaker 4:  Musk. We haven't talked about Elon on the show for a long time. I feel like

1445
01:25:50,745 --> 01:25:54,225
Speaker 4:  we've done a good job, but we can't not talk about this.

1446
01:25:55,175 --> 01:25:58,945
Speaker 4:  Elon sued OpenAI this week for a breach of

1447
01:25:59,145 --> 01:26:02,345
Speaker 4:  contract, which I will come to saying that when, you know, he was a founder

1448
01:26:02,345 --> 01:26:04,645
Speaker 4:  of OpenAI, he gave this company a lot of money. It was supposed to be open

1449
01:26:04,645 --> 01:26:08,405
Speaker 4:  source. And now OpenAI is ex

1450
01:26:08,405 --> 01:26:12,085
Speaker 4:  proprietary extension of Microsoft. He wants the court to declare

1451
01:26:12,465 --> 01:26:16,365
Speaker 4:  the GT four is actually artificial general intelligence and must

1452
01:26:16,365 --> 01:26:19,965
Speaker 4:  be open source. It's crazy. The whole thing's crazy. OpenAI released a

1453
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:23,365
Speaker 4:  reply. We thought it would be a legal filing, but it's just a blog post

1454
01:26:24,035 --> 01:26:27,965
Speaker 4:  that says Elon's done. Yeah. Like more or less that's what it

1455
01:26:27,965 --> 01:26:31,605
Speaker 4:  says with a bunch of emails where Elon is like, we should make

1456
01:26:31,665 --> 01:26:35,325
Speaker 4:  OpenAI part of Tesla. We obviously can't compete with Google.

1457
01:26:35,515 --> 01:26:37,085
Speaker 4:  Like there's just a bunch of emails in here,

1458
01:26:39,035 --> 01:26:41,745
Speaker 4:  which are, which is just a weird way to respond to, it's like, here's the

1459
01:26:41,745 --> 01:26:45,705
Speaker 4:  receipts also notably Ilya who has not been heard from

1460
01:26:46,035 --> 01:26:49,865
Speaker 4:  since the Sam Altman OpenAI, CEO signed the OpenAI response blog

1461
01:26:49,865 --> 01:26:53,705
Speaker 4:  post. Yep. So they're united on this. Here's what I will say about this O

1462
01:26:53,845 --> 01:26:57,625
Speaker 4:  OpenAI response and they say they're gonna move to dismiss the lawsuit. All

1463
01:26:57,905 --> 01:26:58,105
Speaker 4:  the claims.

1464
01:26:59,705 --> 01:27:03,235
Speaker 4:  This is just very basic stuff. And I'll say I got one thing wrong in the

1465
01:27:03,235 --> 01:27:06,835
Speaker 4:  blog post, but I did it on purpose as a test If, you believe me.

1466
01:27:07,705 --> 01:27:11,475
Speaker 4:  Sure. So I wrote about this. Okay. I'm not wrong, you're wrong. I'm not wrong.

1467
01:27:11,555 --> 01:27:12,195
Speaker 4:  I was testing you.

1468
01:27:14,865 --> 01:27:18,715
Speaker 4:  Sure. As, as you may know, I was once a lawyer. I was not

1469
01:27:18,715 --> 01:27:21,955
Speaker 4:  good at being a lawyer. I'm not claiming that I was a good lawyer. I very

1470
01:27:21,955 --> 01:27:25,875
Speaker 4:  quickly moved to blogging about cell phones. That's how

1471
01:27:25,875 --> 01:27:29,475
Speaker 4:  my legal career was going. I was like, what if I memorized the name of every

1472
01:27:29,675 --> 01:27:33,115
Speaker 4:  HTC cellphone? Right. That was a better choice for me as a person.

1473
01:27:34,495 --> 01:27:37,875
Speaker 4:  But I, I did, I did the thing. And I know a bunch of lawyers. I'm married

1474
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:40,235
Speaker 4:  to a lawyer. We got lawyers on our staff. We got lawyers at the company.

1475
01:27:41,105 --> 01:27:44,875
Speaker 4:  They're everywhere. Like you can't get away from 'em. And I was like,

1476
01:27:44,895 --> 01:27:48,675
Speaker 4:  Hey, can you sue someone for breach of contract if there isn't a

1477
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:52,795
Speaker 4:  contract? And the answer is basically no. Like

1478
01:27:53,225 --> 01:27:57,155
Speaker 4:  that fundamentally is the answer. Like you have to have a

1479
01:27:57,315 --> 01:28:00,915
Speaker 4:  contract, particularly if the performance of said

1480
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:05,195
Speaker 4:  illusory contract takes place over a year, like longer than a

1481
01:28:05,195 --> 01:28:08,795
Speaker 4:  year. Hmm. So for example, I'll give you a law school hypothetical. Alex

1482
01:28:08,795 --> 01:28:12,115
Speaker 4:  and I are friends, right. I say to Alex, this is like some real law school

1483
01:28:12,115 --> 01:28:15,995
Speaker 4:  shit. I said Alex, like I'm gonna deliver you 50 pieces of

1484
01:28:15,995 --> 01:28:19,795
Speaker 4:  lumber a week for $50. Yeah. And Alex says, cool. And then we

1485
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:23,675
Speaker 4:  shake hands, right? And then I show up and I say, here's my 50 pieces

1486
01:28:23,695 --> 01:28:26,235
Speaker 4:  of lumber. And Alex says, here's the 50 bucks. And we just do that over and

1487
01:28:26,235 --> 01:28:30,075
Speaker 4:  over again for 11 months. Right. you know, the

1488
01:28:30,075 --> 01:28:33,275
Speaker 4:  12th month I show up, I deliver the lumber. Alex doesn't pay me the money,

1489
01:28:33,915 --> 01:28:37,675
Speaker 4:  I can probably sue her for breach of contract. Rude, you've got all this

1490
01:28:37,675 --> 01:28:41,635
Speaker 4:  performance. I, I put, I took the lumber. And by the way, in

1491
01:28:41,635 --> 01:28:44,155
Speaker 4:  law school it's like always lumber. It's always something like this. Like

1492
01:28:44,155 --> 01:28:47,315
Speaker 4:  things of like, what are, what are you talking about? Like of pay? Yeah.

1493
01:28:47,315 --> 01:28:51,195
Speaker 4:  You're like, like most law students are like one Ls are 23 years old

1494
01:28:51,195 --> 01:28:54,715
Speaker 4:  and the ancient law professor is like, and then what would happen? If, you

1495
01:28:54,715 --> 01:28:56,915
Speaker 4:  didn't deliver the lumber. And they're like, what are you talking about?

1496
01:28:58,945 --> 01:29:01,125
Speaker 4:  What is I didn't do the reading. So, I I

1497
01:29:01,365 --> 01:29:03,845
Speaker 5:  Promised to Venmo you every week. Exactly. Yeah.

1498
01:29:03,845 --> 01:29:07,525
Speaker 4:  Okay. Like it's always like this. Then you could sue, right. You have this

1499
01:29:07,525 --> 01:29:11,125
Speaker 4:  like re I did this thing called reliance where because Alex

1500
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:14,725
Speaker 4:  had paid me before I went, I dropped out the lumber, I left, I assumed the

1501
01:29:14,725 --> 01:29:17,965
Speaker 4:  money would come. She didn't pay me. I say, you gotta pay me. I go to the

1502
01:29:17,965 --> 01:29:21,485
Speaker 4:  court and say, look at all of this history and then look at the negative

1503
01:29:21,485 --> 01:29:25,325
Speaker 4:  thing that happened to me because I assumed that she would do the thing

1504
01:29:25,535 --> 01:29:28,885
Speaker 4:  which is pay me the money for the lumber. That for some reason I had been

1505
01:29:28,885 --> 01:29:32,285
Speaker 4:  delivering for 11 months without a written contract sick for. And that's

1506
01:29:32,285 --> 01:29:35,845
Speaker 4:  like the, the classic law school. Can you enforce a contract that's not written

1507
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:38,965
Speaker 4:  down? Example Elon is saying not that

1508
01:29:40,635 --> 01:29:42,365
Speaker 4:  like so much, not that

1509
01:29:44,195 --> 01:29:47,725
Speaker 4:  like the most, not that he's saying there is a contract,

1510
01:29:48,145 --> 01:29:51,765
Speaker 4:  but the contract called the founder's agreement only

1511
01:29:51,865 --> 01:29:54,725
Speaker 4:  exists in other pieces of paper.

1512
01:29:55,755 --> 01:29:59,525
Speaker 4:  He's like, it's in these emails I have between me and the other founders.

1513
01:30:00,035 --> 01:30:03,205
Speaker 4:  It's in the articles of incorporation that they filed in the state of California.

1514
01:30:03,355 --> 01:30:06,165
Speaker 4:  Like court just read some stuff I'd like you to read,

1515
01:30:07,175 --> 01:30:10,205
Speaker 4:  write me a contract and then say they breached that contract.

1516
01:30:10,215 --> 01:30:12,845
Speaker 5:  Right? He's saying, If, you read all these things. Like you'll, you'll get

1517
01:30:12,845 --> 01:30:14,005
Speaker 5:  the idea, right?

1518
01:30:14,035 --> 01:30:17,845
Speaker 4:  That when I was donating money to a nonprofit, I assumed that they would

1519
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:21,325
Speaker 4:  do. And it's like ev she's like, If, you are a first year lawsuit and you're

1520
01:30:21,325 --> 01:30:23,885
Speaker 4:  listening to this or you attended law school. Or even if you're thinking

1521
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:27,595
Speaker 4:  about attending law school, just ask yourself, you're a judge.

1522
01:30:27,775 --> 01:30:31,275
Speaker 4:  You're, you're looking at the richest man in the world. And he's like, I

1523
01:30:31,275 --> 01:30:34,955
Speaker 4:  don't know, I'm kind of an idiot. Like I just gave him all this money without

1524
01:30:34,995 --> 01:30:38,955
Speaker 4:  a contract. And the judges be like, get outta here. Like my own

1525
01:30:39,135 --> 01:30:42,435
Speaker 4:  one L contracts professor, his name is Stuart McCauley used to say to us

1526
01:30:42,435 --> 01:30:45,195
Speaker 4:  all the time, what happens? He pays your money and he takes your chances

1527
01:30:46,085 --> 01:30:49,625
Speaker 4:  and like If, you buy the stuff and it's bad. Like that's on you. And like

1528
01:30:49,655 --> 01:30:52,825
Speaker 4:  here, Elon's like donated the money and he

1529
01:30:53,645 --> 01:30:57,505
Speaker 4:  had, he has all these emails, like these other emails are like that opening

1530
01:30:57,525 --> 01:31:00,345
Speaker 4:  eye is publishing where he's like, this isn't enough money. We're never gonna

1531
01:31:00,345 --> 01:31:03,185
Speaker 4:  succeed. I want total control of this or I'm not gonna give you more money.

1532
01:31:03,725 --> 01:31:07,425
Speaker 4:  And it's like, dude, you just didn't have the first thing. Yep. Like the

1533
01:31:07,425 --> 01:31:11,145
Speaker 4:  first thing, right? Which is what are the terms of me giving you this money?

1534
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:15,185
Speaker 4:  You didn't write 'em down. It is the silliest one L law

1535
01:31:15,185 --> 01:31:18,585
Speaker 4:  school problem I can think of to file a claim for breach of contract and

1536
01:31:18,585 --> 01:31:21,665
Speaker 4:  then within the breach of contract claim that the contract does not exist,

1537
01:31:22,005 --> 01:31:25,705
Speaker 4:  but is actually located in some emails. Like I cannot tell you

1538
01:31:25,815 --> 01:31:28,905
Speaker 4:  what every, like I showed it to Becky and she just gave me the face

1539
01:31:29,815 --> 01:31:33,425
Speaker 4:  like I don't want to think about this. I like, she's like, I graduated from

1540
01:31:33,425 --> 01:31:36,505
Speaker 4:  law school, I'm a practicing attorney. We don't do this anymore.

1541
01:31:38,085 --> 01:31:41,905
Speaker 4:  And then the second one, the claim is for promissory estoppel, which

1542
01:31:42,365 --> 01:31:45,345
Speaker 4:  is long term, but that's the thing where it's like I delivered the lumber

1543
01:31:45,405 --> 01:31:48,745
Speaker 4:  and Alex to pay me the money and So I, I have what's called

1544
01:31:48,745 --> 01:31:52,625
Speaker 4:  detrimental reliance. So I like assumed she would do the

1545
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:55,545
Speaker 4:  thing. Sorry Alex, I assumed Alex would pay me the money that she didn't

1546
01:31:55,545 --> 01:31:58,025
Speaker 4:  been pay me for for months and months and months. And then I did the thing.

1547
01:31:58,025 --> 01:32:01,965
Speaker 4:  She didn't pay me the money. I've now relied on her promises to me and performance

1548
01:32:01,965 --> 01:32:05,405
Speaker 4:  of those promises in the past. There's none of that here because the detrimental

1549
01:32:05,485 --> 01:32:08,845
Speaker 4:  reliance is that open air was supposed to deliver a GI,

1550
01:32:09,935 --> 01:32:12,325
Speaker 13:  Which you cannot possibly claim.

1551
01:32:14,275 --> 01:32:15,285
Speaker 13:  Just what are

1552
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:15,845
Speaker 4:  You talking about?

1553
01:32:16,435 --> 01:32:17,445
Speaker 6:  They didn't make skynet.

1554
01:32:17,625 --> 01:32:21,525
Speaker 4:  Anyway. It's all very dumb. The thing I got wrong is that I put a joke at

1555
01:32:21,525 --> 01:32:23,965
Speaker 4:  the end, another one L law school joke, where I was like, the thing that

1556
01:32:23,965 --> 01:32:27,805
Speaker 4:  will happen is OpenAI will, will file a,

1557
01:32:27,965 --> 01:32:31,285
Speaker 4:  a motion to dismiss. And I use the federal name of the motion. This place

1558
01:32:31,305 --> 01:32:34,165
Speaker 4:  and California quote, it's called a demur. I'm very sorry, I'm not gonna

1559
01:32:34,165 --> 01:32:36,725
Speaker 4:  correct it because it's a honeypot for nerds.

1560
01:32:36,775 --> 01:32:40,445
Speaker 5:  First of all, that's a nerds, a really good joke. It's a really good funny

1561
01:32:40,475 --> 01:32:43,245
Speaker 5:  joke that lots of people got and enjoyed. So great job

1562
01:32:43,495 --> 01:32:44,845
Speaker 4:  Sarah John thought it was hilarious.

1563
01:32:45,225 --> 01:32:48,165
Speaker 5:  I'm glad. There you go. It's the audience is small, but it's there. I think

1564
01:32:48,585 --> 01:32:52,285
Speaker 5:  to me, the wildest thing about this is this now marks two episodes in

1565
01:32:52,385 --> 01:32:56,245
Speaker 5:  two weeks in which we have talked about Elon Musk demanding to

1566
01:32:56,245 --> 01:33:00,165
Speaker 5:  take over another company. Yes. Last week it was Elon saying, I'll sell

1567
01:33:00,165 --> 01:33:04,125
Speaker 5:  Tesla to you Tim Cook, but I wanna be the CEO of Apple. And now

1568
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:08,085
Speaker 5:  it's open AI and true, true co. Like you miss a hundred percent

1569
01:33:08,085 --> 01:33:09,725
Speaker 5:  of the shots you don't take. you know what I mean? Yeah.

1570
01:33:09,915 --> 01:33:10,205
Speaker 4:  Like,

1571
01:33:10,205 --> 01:33:11,565
Speaker 6:  Shoot your shot, Elon. Next,

1572
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:15,525
Speaker 5:  Next he's gonna be like, listen Larry Page, just give me Google. Just,

1573
01:33:15,525 --> 01:33:16,965
Speaker 5:  just shut up. Just gimme Google.

1574
01:33:17,715 --> 01:33:20,725
Speaker 4:  Well, I mean he's actually two Tesla shareholders saying, give me more of

1580
01:33:40,085 --> 01:33:44,005

1581
01:33:44,435 --> 01:33:47,885
Speaker 4:  That when they sign up for their Twitter account, they knew they weren't

1582
01:33:48,005 --> 01:33:51,325
Speaker 4:  supposed to do X, Y, and Z and they could foresee that they would be

1583

Speaker 4:  interfering in, in X's business relationships by doing whatever they did.

1584

Speaker 6:  and that I've never been in court, but

1592
01:34:19,365 --> 01:34:23,085
