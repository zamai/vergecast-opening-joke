00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,030
Speaker 1:  This might have to be your last appearance on the verge cast. Like I don't

15
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,080
Speaker 1:  This might have to be your last appearance on the verge cast. Like I don't

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,900
Speaker 1:  know how we in good faith, bring you back after this.

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,460
Speaker 5:  Hello and welcome to our chest flagship podcast of reacting. Well

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,300
Speaker 5:  to change, that's the theme of this episode. I'm your friend Nila. David Pierce

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,480
Speaker 5:  is here.

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,680
Speaker 1:  Hi, unlike you I'm at home. Where are you? You lie. What is happening here?

21
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,180
Speaker 5:  So I'm at my parent's house. I'm in their office. They're both doctors

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,580
Speaker 5:  literally got on a call yesterday and someone said, are you in a doctor's

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,570
Speaker 5:  office? Because my mom had the shelving unit put in by the people who did

24
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,470
Speaker 5:  her actual doctor's office. So it very much looks like a

25
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,240
Speaker 5:  doctor. There's a model of a heart behind me,

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,860
Speaker 6:  Point out the heart

27
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,400
Speaker 5:  That listeners can't see this, but I will just say, here's their mass pad.

28
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,280
Speaker 5:  It's an emergency helicopter MassPAT pad

29
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,950
Speaker 1:  With an 800 number to

30
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,520
Speaker 5:  Call in case you need a flight for life. That's kind of swag. My parents

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,510
Speaker 5:  get it's got it's. I was in I'm interesting because I moderated a

32
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,110
Speaker 5:  panel on Foxconn last night for a group of concerned citizens. It was great.

33
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,230
Speaker 5:  It was very fun. I told as many jokes about being from Racine as I could

34
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,310
Speaker 5:  to try to diffuse the room. And then at the end they had questions. I

35
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,940
Speaker 5:  submitted all the questions on pieces of paper and just a huge stack of

36
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,870
Speaker 5:  questions was about the project manager of the Fox. His name is

37
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,200
Speaker 5:  Claude wise and literally the questions are, why do we keep paying this guy?

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,430
Speaker 5:  There was just like a stack, like a quarter inch thick stack of paper

39
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,650
Speaker 5:  that all just said, why are we paying this guy? It was good, but it's going

40
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,220
Speaker 5:  to be back in our scene. It's very good. I will say that I'm using a bunch

41
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,030
Speaker 5:  of podcasts here that I just rustled up at best buy. Yeah. Like every

42
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,450
Speaker 5:  best buy is the same, but like your teenage best buy is special. I got to

43
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,290
Speaker 5:  go back to my teenage best buy and I just bought podcast gear and

44
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,800
Speaker 5:  much to everyone's dismay. I think, including my own,

45
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,480
Speaker 6:  Not my dismay. This is the best

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,170
Speaker 5:  Moment it has a built-in soundboard came with preloaded sound

47
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,770
Speaker 5:  effects. So like at any time I can just

48
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,940
Speaker 5:  ruin the show.

49
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,260
Speaker 1:  Yeah. That's all over now. I really like imagining you going back to your

50
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,600
Speaker 1:  teenage best, by the way that like superstar high school athletes go back

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,560
Speaker 1:  to their gymnasium. You open the door and everyone is like, oh

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,070
Speaker 1:  my God,

53
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,750
Speaker 5:  It's him. And starts cheering.

54
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,650
Speaker 1:  There's like a statue of you in the corner. Somewhere like Nila bought the

55
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,930
Speaker 1:  whole best buy. One time.

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,110
Speaker 5:  It's stand in the middle of the TV island. Do you know who I am? I'm trying

57
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,830
Speaker 5:  to resetting the settings on every one of these demo televisions, sir, by

58
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,690
Speaker 5:  the way, forgot to introduce Alex, Alex. Cranz this year.

59
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,010
Speaker 6:  I'm also here. Yeah, that's true. But play me some, thank you. I was going

60
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,320
Speaker 6:  to be like, I need some intro music. Give me some intro

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,240
Speaker 5:  Music. I got that. I had that button too.

62
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,270
Speaker 6:  It's so

63
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,510
Speaker 6:  Alex is here.

64
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,620
Speaker 5:  All right. I promise not to overdo it. This is why they haven't given me

65
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,460
Speaker 5:  a soundboard.

66
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,970
Speaker 5:  Okay. I want to start by just two things at the top

67
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,360
Speaker 5:  one. I'm only going to hear for the first second of the show. The code conference

68
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,230
Speaker 5:  is next week and I have infinity meetings to go to

69
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,840
Speaker 5:  because the code conference, which by the way, it's happening at the same

70
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,500
Speaker 5:  time as the apple event. So the next week of my life is next week of all

71
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,770
Speaker 5:  of our lives. The verge is bonkers. So sadly, I'm just going to hear it for

72
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,520
Speaker 5:  the first segment, but I think Casey is joining you all talk about snap and

73
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,210
Speaker 5:  editable tweets.

74
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,950
Speaker 1:  That'd be great. We're excited about it will be fun.

75
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,040
Speaker 5:  Finally replaced by Casey, a longstanding dream of flying

76
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,720
Speaker 6:  Soundboard set

77
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,070
Speaker 5:  Because of the soundboard. Second, I just want everyone to take a moment

78
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,970
Speaker 5:  and think kind thoughts about Liam, our producer, like stop what you're

79
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,720
Speaker 5:  doing, pull over the car and just think about Liam in a positive way.

80
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,860
Speaker 5:  Because last week I also had a meeting and we had to cut the show short

81
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,270
Speaker 5:  and we actually got out the explanation because it was just

82
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,990
Speaker 5:  in the middle of a long nonsensical ramble. We cut out a lot of long non

83
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,200
Speaker 5:  sensible rambles on the show. And we were making jokes with a clock because

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,650
Speaker 5:  Liam had me on a timer. So I could go to my meeting

85
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,210
Speaker 5:  with rod to explain it to all of you. And it was fine. And you know, we always

86
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,970
Speaker 5:  go over our show's supposed to be an hour long. We historically have gone

87
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,720
Speaker 5:  over for five years, which is fine. But

88
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,680
Speaker 5:  the notes were at first, very positive and heartwarming. Yeah,

89
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,790
Speaker 5:  I think it got weird. Y'all like to the point where I was reading articles

90
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,510
Speaker 5:  about what Harry styles does, when one direction fans get out of control,

91
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,420
Speaker 5:  you know, I was like, all right, we have like, I don't know what's going

92
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,410
Speaker 5:  on here. So I appreciate our fandom such as it is a

93
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,650
Speaker 5:  bunch of people resetting the settings in best buy you're my people. I love

94
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,640
Speaker 5:  you. We love you. But it was me that made the show short

95
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,600
Speaker 5:  last week. And Liam was just keeping me on task, which is no easy

96
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,590
Speaker 5:  feat. This man is heroic. So just, just think kind thoughts

97
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,460
Speaker 5:  about Liam will do a better job explaining when my schedule makes the

98
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,180
Speaker 5:  show not 90 minutes, it's still going to be, you know,

99
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,170
Speaker 5:  60 solid,

100
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,080
Speaker 1:  I think in general, you should assume that if something is wrong with the

101
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,230
Speaker 1:  Vergecast it's Neil I's fault. Like that feels like generally the right

102
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,920
Speaker 1:  answer. It's like if something bad happened

103
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,980
Speaker 6:  A hundred percent,

104
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,230
Speaker 1:  Yes. Case in point,

105
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:54,850
Speaker 5:  I

106
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,230
Speaker 6:  Just want to say, I feel

107
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,050
Speaker 7:  Really uncomfortable right now. Also dear listener, I had

108
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,860
Speaker 7:  nothing to do with this sound board. It was not approved by me.

109
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,290
Speaker 7:  I will do my best.

110
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,370
Speaker 5:  And you get rid of

111
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,540
Speaker 5:  that one. Still Andrew pushed the wrong button.

112
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,670
Speaker 7:  No, we're leaving that in. I need people to know what you would do

113
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,430
Speaker 5:  To not push these four buttons. Do you

114
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,400
Speaker 6:  Have a wall?

115
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,710
Speaker 5:  I sure do. It's buried in the settings of this thing,

116
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,760
Speaker 5:  which I will not go through at this time, but maybe later, maybe we'll just

117
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,660
Speaker 5:  have a 90 minute Vergecast or I play with the settings of my zoom pod

118
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,350
Speaker 5:  track. <inaudible> and we can just do it. That's our take talk strategy,

119
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,970
Speaker 5:  but people sent weird notes to Liam. I think that's out of bounds. Don't

120
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,450
Speaker 5:  do that. If you're a problem to show, talk to us, Liam is a part of our show.

121
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,440
Speaker 5:  He, he makes the show good along with Andrew, our, our engineer. So be cool

122
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,130
Speaker 5:  to them. Blame it on me. That's fine. Okay. Let's talk about some news this

123
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,770
Speaker 5:  week. We got apple event next week and a bunch of gadget news. This week.

124
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,680
Speaker 5:  Twitter is doing editable tweets. Casey's going to have to talk about that.

125
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,520
Speaker 5:  Let's start with apple. We've got a big sort of state of apple special

126
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,760
Speaker 5:  episode coming next week that David made us do quite honestly, he gave us

127
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,140
Speaker 5:  homework. We had to do homework for

128
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,150
Speaker 6:  Us. It was good. I did. All of mine

129
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,850
Speaker 5:  Was a lot of homework. So we'll talk about the broader state of apple next

130
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,480
Speaker 5:  week, but let's talk about the event cause it's common. It's called far out,

131
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,590
Speaker 5:  by the way, a number of people wrote to us after we said, does anyone

132
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,690
Speaker 5:  want to write about the invites? A lot

133
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,290
Speaker 6:  Of people do.

134
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,190
Speaker 5:  And I think Jake is actually has assigned that story based

135
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,370
Speaker 5:  on. So it's good. So the event's called far out. You don't know what that

136
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,330
Speaker 5:  means. There's a lot of noise about satellite connectivity and phone's slightly

137
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,840
Speaker 5:  what's going on there

138
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,010
Speaker 6:  Far out, man,

139
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,300
Speaker 1:  A far out, you know, hints at satellite

140
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,180
Speaker 1:  is one version of this. And there have been rumors flying around. I think

141
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,720
Speaker 1:  mostly thanks to mark Gruner at Bloomberg, who is usually right about this

142
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,380
Speaker 1:  stuff. That satellite connectivity is a thing that apple has been working

143
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,070
Speaker 1:  on. It may depend on some complicated deals with

144
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,850
Speaker 1:  wireless carriers, how that would work, but satellite

145
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,610
Speaker 1:  connection is potentially a thing that you are going to get on future apple

146
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,450
Speaker 1:  devices. And the thing that I think is most interesting. And you

147
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,480
Speaker 1:  said this new line, I think I thought you were wrong and it turns out, I

148
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,380
Speaker 1:  think you were right, is that the apple watch seems to

149
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,040
Speaker 1:  be like maybe the most interesting thing coming at this

150
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,760
Speaker 1:  event, especially if the new apple watch pro, which is rumored to be bigger

151
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,270
Speaker 1:  and more rugged and industrial. And like for people who use big garments,

152
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,170
Speaker 1:  more watches, if that thing gets satellite connectivity, which is one of

153
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,410
Speaker 1:  the things that's now being talked about would be a huge deal. And there

154
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,240
Speaker 1:  seems to be a lot of excitement about that idea

155
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,870
Speaker 6:  Because its competitors already have satellite connectivity, but like in

156
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,870
Speaker 6:  a different way, right? Like, like the competitors are doing it to kind of

157
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,770
Speaker 6:  like be a backup to GPS, I think, whereas the rumors

158
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,050
Speaker 1:  Like an emergency system for a lot of these.

159
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,010
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And the rumors for the apple one is that this would help you like

160
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,850
Speaker 6:  stay connected online and be really good emergency

161
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,010
Speaker 6:  services, but maybe not this year, but

162
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,950
Speaker 5:  There's a few cuts at this. Right? So T-Mobile and Starlink just

163
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,430
Speaker 5:  announced a big deal. T-Mobile phones were able to connect to

164
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,420
Speaker 5:  Starlink, which is cool. Like just legitimately cool. But you know,

165
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,260
Speaker 5:  you obviously need to have line of sight to Starlink, which is a

166
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,600
Speaker 5:  startling.

167
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,890
Speaker 1:  It's one of those things that like sounds really cool in the abstract and

168
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,820
Speaker 1:  will not affect any real person in life. Very often. It's

169
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,450
Speaker 1:  like as a T-Mobile subscriber in New York city, like this will affect my

170
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,580
Speaker 1:  life in no way whatsoever.

171
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,660
Speaker 5:  I mean the game is coverage gaps in time. Like you're going to make the apple

172
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,760
Speaker 5:  watch bigger. You're gonna add a big battery. And then you're going to add

173
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,270
Speaker 5:  the radio that will kill that battery as fast as possible. Like that's part

174
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,820
Speaker 5:  of the game that's being played here. But so the startling thing is like

175
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,050
Speaker 5:  Starlink is on its own bands as its own communication system.

176
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,650
Speaker 5:  It does its thing

177
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,060
Speaker 6:  It's on bands for now,

178
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,890
Speaker 5:  Until there are ongoing fight with dish network continues to

179
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,590
Speaker 5:  rage, then there are a bunch of other companies, there's a company called

180
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,830
Speaker 5:  link with a Y that we've written about. We just reached out back to them,

181
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,950
Speaker 5:  Mitchell Clark owner, a great story about these other satellite companies

182
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,590
Speaker 5:  that are doing satellite connectivity. They're actually all pretty excited

183
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,320
Speaker 5:  about the Starling thing in the way that companies are always excited. When

184
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,720
Speaker 5:  the famous company starts to do the thing they're doing, they're like a rising

185
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,380
Speaker 5:  tide. Everyone will know about us. We'll see how that goes. But link

186
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,310
Speaker 5:  actually is basically doing cell towers in space, right? So you've

187
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,760
Speaker 5:  got basically a cell base station on a satellite sending

188
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,330
Speaker 5:  standard LTE signals, 5g signals to

189
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,110
Speaker 5:  phones. And so we've covered this before. Loren Grush wrote

190
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,020
Speaker 5:  about it. Mitchell just wrote about it. This is okay. You're in a place with

191
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,830
Speaker 5:  no service. And your phone just connects using a standard radio

192
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,610
Speaker 5:  to a satellite, which is different than Starling, right? It's it's still

193
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,300
Speaker 5:  using it's LTE radio. It's unclear. And there's a

194
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,080
Speaker 5:  third thing that apple has been rumored to be doing, which is a totally

195
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,740
Speaker 5:  different satellite system. So it's unclear which of these things will come

196
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,460
Speaker 5:  to the watch. I'd very much doubt at Starling. The question is whether

197
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,870
Speaker 5:  you know, it, most people, most days with their apple watch are sitting

198
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,290
Speaker 5:  inside of an LTE or 5g coverage area, right? Like that's,

199
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,950
Speaker 5:  that's the point of the cell network is to mostly cover everything. It's

200
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,400
Speaker 5:  when you are up on the mountain or in the middle of the ocean or wherever

201
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,120
Speaker 5:  the, you don't have a cell network that you'll hit, hit, hit the satellite,

202
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,750
Speaker 6:  The entire great Plains. You just won't have internet

203
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,210
Speaker 6:  connection half the time. It's really bad. Right.

204
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,690
Speaker 5:  I think the question is like, okay, you're in a rural area. You're here in

205
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,200
Speaker 5:  Wisconsin and you drive off the highway for 45 minutes where there's no

206
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,980
Speaker 5:  service is your phone slash watch, gonna flip over to satellite.

207
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,210
Speaker 6:  And that's cool.

208
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,480
Speaker 5:  Open question. Yeah. And I think that, that would be really cool if they

209
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,770
Speaker 5:  pull it off. I think the question is like, which satellite system are they

210
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,690
Speaker 5:  going to use? Right. Because there are these competing variations of it Starling

211
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,810
Speaker 5:  being one Lincoln, the other one's being another, like which system is apple

212
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,560
Speaker 5:  going to use if, if they use any of them and how will they type of battery

213
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,740
Speaker 5:  life.

214
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,860
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But I do think, I mean, this is why I think it, like there had been

215
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,780
Speaker 1:  rumors about this coming to the iPhone and stuff too. And I think all of

216
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,650
Speaker 1:  that makes some sense, but I think, especially for people who are like the

217
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,290
Speaker 1:  watch pro potential buyers, assuming the watch pro is, you know, what it's

218
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,650
Speaker 1:  called and what we think it is. Those are the people who like seek out the

219
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,460
Speaker 1:  kinds of places you're describing. Right. Yeah. And, and are going to be

220
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,710
Speaker 1:  willing to make the kind of trade-off where it's like, okay, this, this might

221
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,670
Speaker 1:  be a thing I like have to turn on on purpose, but it means I don't have to

222
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,450
Speaker 1:  carry a gigantic satellite phone or one of those

223
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,500
Speaker 1:  big Garmin in reach things like it's just as an

224
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,800
Speaker 1:  added extra thing, it strikes me as like very niche, but

225
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,550
Speaker 1:  massively meaningful for those kinds of people. Even if it's like a

226
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,480
Speaker 1:  somewhat clunky system, I have to say, I would not rule out Starlink, just

227
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,260
Speaker 1:  because I think it would be like deeply hilarious Elon Musk thing to be like,

228
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,190
Speaker 1:  he, he just like, he's putting it all the weird places you can think of.

229
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,730
Speaker 1:  And they're Lakewood watch Starlink. We don't know what it's for cost

230
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,700
Speaker 1:  $9,000 a month, but it exists.

231
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,230
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean he just announced Starling kind of cruise ships, Starlink perfect

232
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,500
Speaker 5:  for cruise ships, no trees in the ocean. I'm told

233
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,570
Speaker 5:  I, you know, I just think like the, the T-Mobile deal is like, it's

234
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,260
Speaker 5:  interesting. T-Mobile is aggressive in that way of it. They need to expand

235
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,230
Speaker 5:  their coverage map. Right. They've got a really good network and the places

236
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,040
Speaker 5:  they are, but they're not everywhere. That deal makes sense for them. And

237
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,860
Speaker 5:  they get some hype. But I think for apple and the iPhone, a feature

238
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,250
Speaker 5:  like this cannot be tied to one carrier is

239
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,580
Speaker 5:  availability, right? It's it's gotta be taught. It's got to work on all the

240
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,090
Speaker 5:  carriers. It's everywhere. They sell however many iPhones a minute. It's

241
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,150
Speaker 5:  got to work in all the places. Apple sells all those phones around the world.

242
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,290
Speaker 5:  And so I think they need something more robust than just us Starling deal.

243
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,990
Speaker 5:  So we'll see. I think the fundamental question is like, what partner are

244
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,810
Speaker 5:  they going to choose? Is it multiple partners? What systems are they going

245
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,690
Speaker 5:  to use? And fundamentally like, if you are the person that's seeking out

246
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,470
Speaker 5:  the remote area and you're relying on the satellite connectivity, how much

247
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,100
Speaker 5:  battery are you going to get? Because this is the thing that might save your

248
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,090
Speaker 5:  life. Right. Are you going to carry a battery pack with inductive charge?

249
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,570
Speaker 5:  Like those big honkin, Garmin things with they're also big

250
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,410
Speaker 5:  batteries. Like,

251
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,400
Speaker 6:  Well, I think the idea there is that like, it doesn't activate unless you

252
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,000
Speaker 6:  need it to like, oh, I'm stuck on a mountain. I'm like,

253
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,680
Speaker 6:  got way off the trail. I need help. Now I hit the

254
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,610
Speaker 6:  button. Now it activates the satellite. Now it connects me to

255
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,560
Speaker 6:  emergency services so they can come find me,

256
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,150
Speaker 5:  But that's one riff at it.

257
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,330
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And that's like a step above what you're seeing, like Garmin and some

258
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,750
Speaker 6:  of these other companies do now, which is like just souped up

259
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,740
Speaker 6:  GPS, essentially. Like it's just using a number of

260
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,080
Speaker 6:  extra satellites and bands to like,

261
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So we'll see. The question is like, what system are they going to use?

262
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,090
Speaker 5:  Does it provide like, think about Starlink sewing provides

263
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,930
Speaker 5:  broadband data. It doesn't have ancillary services. It's a broadband

264
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,560
Speaker 5:  data connection. The Garmin thing provides a location and like a

265
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,190
Speaker 5:  beacon. There's a whole universe of things in between those two extremes.

266
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,230
Speaker 5:  Where is apple going to land? I think it's a good question.

267
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,020
Speaker 6:  The star lake thing, I just keep going back to, like, I've got a lot of friends

268
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,590
Speaker 6:  who live in rural areas and are driving all the time, just crisscrossing

269
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,320
Speaker 6:  across like New Mexico and Texas. And I'm like, that whole industry of people

270
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,280
Speaker 6:  is just going to go get T-Mobile phones if it works out that well.

271
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,980
Speaker 6:  Right. Like if you can guarantee all those dead

272
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,080
Speaker 5:  Spots above their car as they drive away.

273
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,040
Speaker 6:  Exactly. And I'd be like, finally, I got a service it's wild. You'll be like,

274
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,940
Speaker 6:  just driving down a fairly large highway in like west Texas

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,360
Speaker 6:  and like, okay, I just don't have internet now. I guess I just hope this

276
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,810
Speaker 6:  is the right road to get me where I'm going. Goodbye GPS. Yeah.

277
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,710
Speaker 6:  So,

278
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's also

279
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,930
Speaker 1:  What I'm hearing is Apple's going to launch a Sabbath, like an actual satellite

280
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,090
Speaker 1:  dish that you buy and just carry with you.

281
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,490
Speaker 5:  I will say. I agree. Like the watch is getting more and more interesting

282
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,030
Speaker 5:  as we learn more and more about it. We have a bunch of stories on the watch,

283
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,420
Speaker 5:  the phone, not much more easily tied about the phone next week.

284
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,530
Speaker 6:  My new phone.

285
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,340
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It seems like we have a pretty good idea of what the, the non notch

286
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,220
Speaker 1:  notch is going to look like. And that's kind of all there.

287
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,450
Speaker 1:  So

288
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,950
Speaker 5:  We wrote a story about it. This today, the lightening cable just turned

289
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,430
Speaker 5:  10. So if Apple's going to switch to USBC, this is actually

290
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,270
Speaker 5:  regardless of, you know, European regulators walking around the Capitol

291
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,260
Speaker 5:  cities of Europe, being angry at apple, regardless of what happens there

292
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,740
Speaker 5:  with USB-C, this would be the moment to switch over to the next generation.

293
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,650
Speaker 5:  Right. They rarely make it more than 10 years with,

294
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,670
Speaker 6:  Do you think we're really going to get a USB-C iPhone this year? I feel like

295
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,020
Speaker 6:  20% chance

296
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,690
Speaker 5:  Sort of thing. Like if it was going to happen, it would have already, wheat

297
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,190
Speaker 5:  is my feeling

298
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,230
Speaker 6:  That would be the, that would be the news.

299
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,350
Speaker 5:  The accessory makers would know case makers would know, like it would,

300
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,640
Speaker 5:  it would be huge news, but we'll see it's it is possible that

301
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,930
Speaker 5:  this is the last lightening iPhone. It's also, I would say to a

302
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,080
Speaker 5:  vanishingly smaller percentage possible that this is the USBC FN.

303
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,500
Speaker 1:  Yeah. That, that I, I agree that that's unlikely. Cause it seems like, like

304
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,320
Speaker 1:  your point about accessories is the right one that they tend to be the ones

305
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,130
Speaker 1:  who write this stuff ahead of time, just because you start to see

306
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,730
Speaker 1:  stuff, go through the FCC and everybody's making the models. And it's always

307
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,570
Speaker 1:  hard to know because some of that is just them guessing as based on the same

308
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,530
Speaker 1:  news reports that everybody sees. But there there's like, there's no smoke

309
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,230
Speaker 1:  around that at all right now. And you would think there would at least be

310
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,560
Speaker 1:  a little bit, even if it was going to be like just the pro max is now the

311
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,400
Speaker 1:  USBC model. I feel like there would be, there would be more

312
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,070
Speaker 1:  about that out there right now. Cause that would be a gigantic,

313
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,530
Speaker 5:  You could see them phasing it in that way. That's what they've done with

314
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,250
Speaker 5:  the iPads. So we'll see, it's just it's 10. And that

315
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,000
Speaker 5:  means, regardless of what is happening with regulators and antitrust,

316
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,900
Speaker 5:  like 10 years for any connector is a long time. And this is

317
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,160
Speaker 5:  historically when apple flu,

318
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,210
Speaker 6:  She did it last longer than that original iPod connector. It did. Right?

319
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,910
Speaker 5:  The iPod catcher was made it like eight

320
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,110
Speaker 6:  Years. Good job lightning,

321
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,040
Speaker 5:  2001 to 2008 because they flipped to lightening with a

322
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,030
Speaker 5:  four. No they didn't. So the hold on, let me say it

323
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,420
Speaker 5:  all over again. The iPod connector made it nine or 10 years

324
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,980
Speaker 5:  because they launched the lightning. No, that's still not right. I'm gonna

325
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,490
Speaker 5:  get this right. I'm not going to look. No,

326
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,810
Speaker 7:  You're you're right. It, they started phasing in and out at around nine

327
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,500
Speaker 7:  years, but it lasted for 10 years, the

328
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,360
Speaker 7:  iPod connector, the 30 pin.

329
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,060
Speaker 5:  Right. But th the first iPod had FireWire

330
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,560
Speaker 5:  rip FireWire the greatest connector ever

331
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,790
Speaker 6:  Made best connector.

332
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,990
Speaker 7:  Absolutely. It was Mac only and all that. Yeah.

333
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And then they switched to

334
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,230
Speaker 6:  Plug it into your iMac. Bondi blue.

335
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,470
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They switched to 30 pin when they were going, when they started doing

336
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,130
Speaker 5:  windows and then it lasted through the iPhone four and the iPhone

337
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,120
Speaker 5:  five had lightning and that was kind of it. So it was around for about

338
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,730
Speaker 5:  10 years. Okay. Liam is correct. C thank you, Liam.

339
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,050
Speaker 5:  But anyway, this is about the time, regardless of the regulatory thing. So

340
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,620
Speaker 5:  we'll see, because the apple doing another proprietary connector for the

341
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,490
Speaker 5:  phone seems bonkers and Meg safe

342
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,720
Speaker 5:  is like most weird apple proprietary connectors,

343
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,620
Speaker 5:  not an ecosystem of value. I'm still on the hunt for a

344
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,550
Speaker 5:  MagSafe car charger. That is good. Like there aren't any,

345
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,930
Speaker 1:  My guess would be apple is going to have a USB-C port

346
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,290
Speaker 1:  and also try really hard to sell you. MagSafe accessories is there, they're

347
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:08,220
Speaker 1:  going to like bury the fact that there's a USB-C port at the bottom of

348
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,030
Speaker 1:  every release and webpage and be like, but would you like to charge with

349
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,390
Speaker 1:  mag safe? And so they're going to like, try to convince you to use it, but

350
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,660
Speaker 1:  then actually everyone's just going to use USB-C and apple will happily sell

351
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,850
Speaker 1:  you a $50 USBC because yeah.

352
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,230
Speaker 5:  They'll ever take the portfolio off the phone to me, strike like apple

353
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,920
Speaker 5:  will destroy its own service ability. If there's not a wired

354
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,190
Speaker 5:  connection to the phone to do resets and all that stuff and diagnostics.

355
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,370
Speaker 5:  Okay.

356
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,030
Speaker 6:  I think I would buy one. If it didn't have some sort of like port that was

357
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,390
Speaker 6:  easily.

358
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,080
Speaker 5:  So this is your line and it stamps Bluetooth ports, sir, I leave

359
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,430
Speaker 6:  At least one port because wires are good. I won't, I won't

360
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,030
Speaker 6:  stand for it.

361
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,470
Speaker 5:  And during theme of the verge, why, why are things are better than Y

362
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,330
Speaker 5:  so that's apple. I mean, we're expecting two phones, a watch. I think

363
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,780
Speaker 5:  my interest in the watch just continues to rise. I'm ready for new one. Do

364
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,240
Speaker 5:  you think it'll be still be a square or anything? They're going to be a circle

365
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,980
Speaker 6:  And you don't have like the big shock ring that like all of the, the

366
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,890
Speaker 6:  garments and stuff have, you know, set to protect it. Like, is it going to

367
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,790
Speaker 6:  be like a chunky monster? Like most of them, or is it going to be

368
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,390
Speaker 6:  like apple?

369
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,590
Speaker 5:  I hope so. I hope so. I mean, I think they have to sell the

370
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,650
Speaker 5:  idea of durability here, which is not a thing apple traditionally sells.

371
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,610
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I hope they go full sports Walkman and it's bright

372
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,510
Speaker 5:  yellow and it like has a foldy cover that flips for no reason.

373
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,800
Speaker 5:  Let's do it

374
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,630
Speaker 6:  Just a little bit off.

375
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,950
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. If you haven't seen a Sony sports Walkman from the early

376
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,610
Speaker 5:  nineties, there's a design language that needs to come back into our lives.

377
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,420
Speaker 6:  That was like the satisfaction of closing that versus a regular

378
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,830
Speaker 6:  Walkman. Like if they just

379
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,210
Speaker 5:  Click in the hinge,

380
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,570
Speaker 6:  It was, I can just feel it. It was good. Go by one, everyone,

381
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,480
Speaker 5:  All the rest of the show. Also every one of those sunny products had the

382
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,250
Speaker 5:  word sports written on it in giant

383
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,630
Speaker 6:  Letters, for some reason to sport,

384
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,200
Speaker 5:  Just in case the bright yellow wasn't enough of a tip off

385
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,880
Speaker 5:  what it was. It's like, this is where sports you guys. It's a

386
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,780
Speaker 5:  boombox for sports. All right. There's a bunch of other gash and here's,

387
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,010
Speaker 5:  what's this Logitech thing.

388
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,870
Speaker 6:  I am most excited about this.

389
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,770
Speaker 1:  I'm very excited about this. So we've, we've known for a while, or at least

390
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,120
Speaker 1:  there have been, there have been rumors and leaks for awhile. That logic

391
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,710
Speaker 1:  tech was going to make something along the lines of the

392
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,550
Speaker 1:  Nintendo switch and the steam deck, like where in that spectrum, it would

393
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,210
Speaker 1:  be, nobody knew. But like, as we've talked about on the show, it's basically

394
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,060
Speaker 1:  just a screen with some buttons, logic Tech's really good at making buttons

395
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,030
Speaker 1:  makes a lot of sense that this is a thing logic tech would do. And then the

396
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,990
Speaker 1:  leaks came out and it basically, Alex had kind of like, it's like a,

397
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,950
Speaker 1:  it's like a Nintendo switch light, but it runs

398
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,000
Speaker 1:  actual Android.

399
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,780
Speaker 6:  It's basically a bunch of companies have already been doing this. I think

400
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,620
Speaker 6:  IO is how you pronounce it is one of the big ones besides like steam deck

401
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,460
Speaker 6:  and Nintendo. And this is like logic text version where it's not about

402
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,970
Speaker 6:  creating a whole game ecosystem. It's just like, Hey, you want cloud gaming?

403
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,660
Speaker 6:  You also, I guess, want to play, play store game. Sometimes you can do all

404
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,320
Speaker 6:  of that with this. And it'll probably be really cheap compared to

405
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,670
Speaker 6:  a steam deck or a Nintendo switch. I would hope it looks cheap, like

406
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,450
Speaker 6:  in a good way though.

407
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,930
Speaker 1:  It does achieve well. And I think the, there have been a bunch of rumors

408
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,840
Speaker 1:  out there about like what the specs are going to be. And it sounds like it's

409
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,830
Speaker 1:  going to be much more like phone specs than

410
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,460
Speaker 1:  like,

411
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,030
Speaker 6:  Well, we just, all

412
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,750
Speaker 1:  You need named X specs in that it's not designed to like, right.

413
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,570
Speaker 1:  And they're going to go all in on game streaming. They're doing this with

414
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,140
Speaker 1:  Logitech is working with Tencent to do this, like this idea that like, I

415
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,100
Speaker 1:  need just enough power to basically run like streaming video apps. And then

416
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,970
Speaker 1:  I'll stream games that are harder than that from the cloud

417
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,840
Speaker 1:  strikes me as like the perfect medium of this. I like, I'm very excited.

418
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,230
Speaker 6:  My favorite bit about this image is like the top image shows you a

419
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,500
Speaker 6:  sensibly. A lot of the things you'll be able to play out of the box, Google

420
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,130
Speaker 6:  play X-Box G-Force invidious

421
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,590
Speaker 6:  cloud service. It's great. X-Box

422
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,930
Speaker 1:  Xbox logo for some reason,

423
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,430
Speaker 6:  Theme Chrome and YouTube. So no

424
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:07,420
Speaker 6:  Luna and no stadia. And somebody pointed out that

425
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,840
Speaker 6:  they probably had stadia in there and realized it was like too many Google

426
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,990
Speaker 6:  things on the page. So instead they just replaced it with an Xbox

427
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,120
Speaker 5:  Xbox.

428
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,000
Speaker 6:  That's what? That was the theory in my Twitter

429
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,010
Speaker 1:  List. No one cares.

430
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,450
Speaker 6:  People care. All four of them have been in my DMS this

431
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,870
Speaker 6:  week being like, how did you, could you make fun of stadia? And I was like,

432
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,590
Speaker 6:  it's just, I just noticed it's not there, but it's so easy

433
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,850
Speaker 6:  to exist. And people are like, I want to kick you. I don't know why

434
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,270
Speaker 5:  That's not the right instinct for anything

435
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,820
Speaker 6:  Cloud gaming services. It is.

436
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,670
Speaker 5:  I want to kick it. It's just like you should, in general, you're like

437
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,660
Speaker 5:  matching up the right fair. I want to kick the

438
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,320
Speaker 5:  air violently in the direction of stadia the Alex grand story. It's

439
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,890
Speaker 5:  true. Here's my concern about this whole thing. Cause you said it looks cheap

440
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,810
Speaker 5:  and cheap in a good way. It looks inexpensive.

441
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,040
Speaker 6:  Yes. That's a better way to

442
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,640
Speaker 5:  Put it. And we think it's going to have this Qualcomm G three

443
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,390
Speaker 5:  X platform chip in it reasonably good

444
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,320
Speaker 5:  GPU. Here's my worry about cloud gaming is

445
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,410
Speaker 5:  the most latency dependent thing you can do on a computer,

446
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,880
Speaker 5:  right? Like you push the button, it's got to go to the cloud service.

447
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,820
Speaker 5:  Something's got to happen. It's got to render the next frame of the video

448
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,660
Speaker 5:  in response to your button and send it back to you. Right. That's hard. Like

449
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,470
Speaker 5:  it's just a hard thing. It's, it's hard on Xboxes,

450
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,130
Speaker 5:  which have lots of processing power. Mine is plugged directly into the wall,

451
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,640
Speaker 5:  not the wall. I mean, it is plugged directly in the wall that is accurate.

452
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,630
Speaker 5:  Mine's plugged directly into the router. Like it has a wired connection to

453
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,870
Speaker 5:  my actual internet service. And it's still like, Ugh, you know,

454
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,250
Speaker 5:  inexpensive wifi gadget, having a good cloud gaming

455
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,120
Speaker 5:  experience,

456
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,470
Speaker 6:  Enough cloud gaming like on the steam deck and on like a pixel three, a and

457
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:58,310
Speaker 6:  stuff that I think for most games, especially like adventure games,

458
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:02,030
Speaker 6:  you'll be fine. I wouldn't want to go playing like street

459
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,780
Speaker 6:  fighter on this or call of duty. Those really like Twitch

460
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:10,010
Speaker 6:  intensive games. I would not want to play that in the cloud ever. And

461
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,190
Speaker 6:  certainly not on this, but if you're like, you know what I want to just like

462
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,880
Speaker 6:  bang out some star wars, fallen, Jedi order,

463
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,720
Speaker 6:  whatever it is called, it has a terrible name. But if you want to play that

464
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,360
Speaker 6:  game or an assassin creed, you can

465
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,510
Speaker 5:  Do,

466
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,860
Speaker 9:  It was a twitchy game. You got to step right at the right time.

467
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,630
Speaker 5:  The whole game is stabbing. The whole game is time to stamps.

468
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,560
Speaker 6:  It's not as bad as like having to block someone in street fighter.

469
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,770
Speaker 9:  No people are trying to stab you in that. Have you played Assassin's creed?

470
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,400
Speaker 9:  Yes,

471
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,200
Speaker 6:  But I don't. I would never watch it. People

472
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,660
Speaker 5:  Try to stab you enough to be able to,

473
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,660
Speaker 6:  But I feel like the timing on that's easier to like anticipate versus street

474
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:47,810
Speaker 6:  fighter.

475
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,900
Speaker 5:  All right. The Assassin's creed, people are going to come for you. And

476
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,830
Speaker 6:  Unfortunately

477
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,970
Speaker 5:  They are assassins.

478
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,560
Speaker 5:  Therefore the leaves are roots.

479
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,640
Speaker 6:  We've established a kick. I got chicken. I'm going to

480
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,040
Speaker 6:  kick in the air and their direction. This has gotten very violent. I'm

481
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,490
Speaker 6:  so sorry.

482
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,480
Speaker 5:  I say, I, I, I it's, I think it's, this stuff works on

483
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,560
Speaker 5:  hilariously. It works on PCs. It works on steam deck, which is a little

484
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,460
Speaker 5:  PC. It works on consoles to some extent I'm

485
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,330
Speaker 5:  just like inexpensive wifi gadget. The most important spec for

486
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,250
Speaker 5:  this Ondracek thing is the wifi chip

487
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,910
Speaker 6:  A hundred percent. Yes. And that's the thing we don't know yet. Right? Like

488
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,390
Speaker 6:  we don't know any of the guts of this thing. So it could still be hot, garbage,

489
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,660
Speaker 6:  and also like the price on it. Like just looking at it, thinking about the

490
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,540
Speaker 6:  processor and stuff, the phone that you would need to play cloud gaming is

491
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,350
Speaker 6:  going to be, you know, 400, $500. Are they going to drop that price

492
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,110
Speaker 6:  down here? And how are they going to cut costs to get down to that price

493
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,620
Speaker 6:  for one of these things? Like, is it going to just have the crummiest display

494
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,230
Speaker 6:  of all time? Are the buttons going to be junkie? Like

495
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,480
Speaker 5:  The first place he cut the cost? They're like, you know what? They're going

496
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,890
Speaker 5:  to be a big cheap screen. Yeah.

497
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,510
Speaker 6:  You see every pixel.

498
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:57,990
Speaker 1:  Yep.

499
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,260
Speaker 6:  <inaudible> it's gonna be great. Yeah.

500
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,430
Speaker 5:  What's interesting is this is going to come up against, you know, presumably

501
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:09,270
Speaker 5:  a rebooted switch at some point. Yep. And I, it doesn't seem like

502
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,140
Speaker 5:  Nintendo is going to let X-Box game streaming happened on their platform.

503
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:13,800
Speaker 6:  Never.

504
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,280
Speaker 5:  So I just think there's going to be an odd set of choices here, where you,

505
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:21,270
Speaker 5:  instead of having cartridges, you just have a lineup of weird little handhelds.

506
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,350
Speaker 6:  That's what I have now. And he

507
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,640
Speaker 5:  Was like, pull it out to play a game.

508
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,540
Speaker 6:  Like which one will I do today? Like steam deck switch.

509
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,470
Speaker 1:  That is definitely where we're

510
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,750
Speaker 6:  Headed the little play date, which is really hard.

511
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:31,770
Speaker 5:  I'm play date.

512
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,820
Speaker 6:  I have a play date. I'm terrible at it. Like there's a game where you surf

513
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,610
Speaker 6:  and you have to, you have to do the crank and time with it. And I do not

514
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,370
Speaker 6:  know how people accomplish it. Like there's no instructions. You're just

515
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:41,750
Speaker 6:  supposed to,

516
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,210
Speaker 5:  I think what I'm learning from this conversation is that you are not good

517
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,570
Speaker 5:  at games with timing. And in fact, you discount them. So you discount timing

518
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,030
Speaker 5:  so much. There's no timing and assassins.

519
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,780
Speaker 6:  I was really good at soul caliber to soul

520
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,810
Speaker 6:  caliber too. I was an incredible, that's got timing.

521
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,050
Speaker 5:  That's a logic thing. There's like all kinds of ND screen news going on right

522
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:04,190
Speaker 5:  now.

523
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,000
Speaker 1:  The screens, I love them. Everybody just looks at screens and goes like,

524
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,810
Speaker 1:  what if this was insane? Why would you spend thousands of dollars on that?

525
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,770
Speaker 5:  You can tell like the me, like order

526
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,810
Speaker 5:  sheet went out and the prices were low enough.

527
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,250
Speaker 6:  Everybody said yes. Like

528
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,850
Speaker 5:  Everyone got the facts. It's like bendy screens now available. And they were

529
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,780
Speaker 5:  like, oh, these are cheap now. Sure. Bendable theater, TV

530
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,320
Speaker 5:  stand.

531
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,610
Speaker 6:  Yeah, we've got, we've got LG has its first bendable OLED,

532
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,540
Speaker 6:  which is not quite true because they had the one that rolled. And technically

533
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,290
Speaker 6:  if it's rolling, it's bending, but we'll, we'll allow it.

534
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,880
Speaker 6:  Cause this is like an actual

535
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,840
Speaker 1:  Outside of this one is it lets you choose. I think this is like actually

536
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,930
Speaker 1:  kind of great. Like the more I read about this thing, the more I like it,

537
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,720
Speaker 1:  it, it basically lets you switch between flat and

538
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,710
Speaker 1:  curved modes. And so as we've talked about before, the only

539
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,700
Speaker 1:  use I've ever found for curved screens is to make it feel like you are

540
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,060
Speaker 1:  inside of your zoom call and you just like wrap everyone around you. And

541
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,750
Speaker 1:  that is very cool. And so you can use that and then just push it back when

542
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,840
Speaker 1:  you want to like actually watch TV, like a regular person and not feel like

543
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,080
Speaker 1:  an idiot for buying a curved screen. That makes total sense. To me, I'm very

544
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,440
Speaker 1:  into that. I don't know that I would spend what this thing will cost, but

545
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,660
Speaker 1:  I'm very into that as an idea.

546
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,310
Speaker 6:  I think it's also interesting because for LG in particular, like they're

547
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:24,030
Speaker 6:  calling it a TV, they're branding it as a TV, but it's at

548
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,360
Speaker 6:  42 and which is lower than, which is smaller than that 48 inch. And that

549
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,140
Speaker 6:  48 inch is really where like a lot of people started adopting TVs

550
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,160
Speaker 6:  as monitors and saying actually like the pixel density

551
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,700
Speaker 6:  is good enough. Now that I can just use the setup as a monitor. And this

552
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,370
Speaker 6:  feels like part of LG kind of continuing to dip its toe into

553
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,510
Speaker 6:  like TV's as gaming monitors, LG already

554
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,720
Speaker 6:  has a huge like gaming monitor business. But this is a whole new

555
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,650
Speaker 6:  category of all ads that they're selling as TVs. But really our

556
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:57,610
Speaker 6:  monitors, like this thing is just a monitor. All the pictures of it are

557
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,850
Speaker 6:  as a monitor. Like it's big tower is very monitor based.

558
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,140
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. The stand of this TV hill is ridiculous.

559
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,590
Speaker 5:  Like if you actually use this as a TV, like everyone would be like, what's

560
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,190
Speaker 5:  going on with your TV? Cause it, it has a gigantic and he should, the gift

561
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,850
Speaker 5:  that we have in this story is just incredible. And pull over in your car

562
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,510
Speaker 5:  and read the story about the old, the LGO and flux TV at Eva that we have

563
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,370
Speaker 5:  on the site because a gift is beautiful.

564
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,300
Speaker 1:  It looks like it's about a rapids self around you and like strangle you to

565
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,540
Speaker 1:  death.

566
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,710
Speaker 6:  It's going to be at Eva and, and John Porter is,

567
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,050
Speaker 6:  is there. And he's going to, he's going to go look at this thing

568
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,940
Speaker 5:  And it's going to hug him and hug him until he does.

569
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,740
Speaker 6:  It's just going to embrace him. And it's liquid electric diodes.

570
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:43,300
Speaker 5:  So Samsung also has a big old gaming monitor. The G eight it

571
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,140
Speaker 5:  guess what supports chief horse out and stadia in game pass right

572
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,940
Speaker 5:  in the display. Great.

573
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,930
Speaker 1:  I have come around on this thing that Samsung is doing, which is basically

574
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,890
Speaker 1:  like building smart TVs into its monitors. It took me a while to sort

575
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,990
Speaker 1:  of understand why that's useful. Cause I'm like, well, if I just want to

576
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,440
Speaker 1:  watch Hulu, I'll just go to hulu.com on my computer and it accomplishes at

577
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,260
Speaker 1:  the same thing. But something like this where it's like, okay, you can just

578
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,490
Speaker 1:  like, you can not attach anything and sort of use it as a TV,

579
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,220
Speaker 1:  but then like plugging your laptop when you come home. It's like, that kinda

580
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,610
Speaker 1:  makes sense.

581
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,640
Speaker 5:  It's not useless when your laptop is somewhere else or doing something else.

582
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,900
Speaker 1:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I, I like it. It also looks great at 34

583
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,380
Speaker 1:  inches.

584
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,680
Speaker 6:  This is your home set up. Look like with this thing. Like these big ones

585
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,460
Speaker 6:  totally makes sense. In a dorm room. I can immediately see the big Lebowski

586
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,210
Speaker 6:  poster behind it as soon as you put it in. But, but what's

587
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,990
Speaker 6:  like in a home usually have your, for most people,

588
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,130
Speaker 6:  those of us not in New York, like you usually have an office and a

589
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,560
Speaker 6:  TV room and this puts the two together.

590
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,200
Speaker 1:  I'm sorry. Do you imagine that everyone who doesn't live in New York lives

591
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,370
Speaker 1:  in a gigantic mansion?

592
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,410
Speaker 6:  I assume you all have so many reports on your home. I have

593
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,820
Speaker 6:  three that's it?

594
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,750
Speaker 5:  I'm in a doctor's office

595
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,430
Speaker 1:  Is real. That's fair.

596
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:02,010
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, I think they're set up with this kind of looks like you, maybe

597
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,620
Speaker 5:  like somebody works from home and you've repurposed a room as an

598
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,340
Speaker 5:  office. And like, then you realize like for many hours a day I can use this

599
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,030
Speaker 5:  room for something else. Or you just want to have another TV in your

600
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,930
Speaker 5:  house and you're going to use this as that TV, but

601
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,910
Speaker 5:  then you can also use it in an office set up.

602
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,720
Speaker 1:  Yeah. This is for all the people whose home office is also in a corner of

603
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,350
Speaker 1:  their bedroom, which I think is a lot of people. And now it's also your bedrooms

604
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,820
Speaker 5:  Having a, like a 34 inch ultra wide bedroom TV is

605
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,500
Speaker 5:  a particular kind of flex.

606
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,820
Speaker 6:  I was like, I have a 60 inch bedroom TV. It's important to have

607
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,160
Speaker 6:  a nice TV. Your bedrooms.

608
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,550
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Big guy, other gadget news. So Monica

609
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,390
Speaker 5:  reviewed the Zen book, which folds the new one, the 17 fold.

610
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,330
Speaker 5:  And she was like, this is really close, but it's a six and dumped by it.

611
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:54,590
Speaker 5:  And then she wrote up the new ThinkPad X one fold the second gen. And she

612
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,930
Speaker 5:  was like, this could be it, but it might be a sex in them by it.

613
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,240
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's like

614
00:32:59,660 --> 00:32:59,990
Speaker 5:  The,

615
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,980
Speaker 1:  The, the, the main thing is like, can we build a laptop with a screen

616
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,790
Speaker 1:  that folds? And the answer is like, starting to be yes. But

617
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,090
Speaker 1:  then in both cases, it's like, oh no, you forgot to build a good lab.

618
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,080
Speaker 6:  I kind of love it because all of this was happening. Like these things have

619
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,830
Speaker 6:  been in development for years. We've all seen these prototypes

620
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,340
Speaker 6:  slate. When you go to a briefing, somebody say, Hey, come here, come here.

621
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,680
Speaker 6:  I got something cool for you in the, pull it out of a bag. And it's always

622
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,580
Speaker 6:  one of these devices. Yeah. And for years now, right.

623
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,900
Speaker 6:  And then we all thought it was because windows, Microsoft was going to do

624
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,260
Speaker 6:  their big, what was it? The Neo, they were going to do Neo. And it was going

625
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,440
Speaker 6:  to be like their big folding laptop thing. And then they just have banded

626
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,400
Speaker 6:  it. And all of that,

627
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,150
Speaker 5:  It wasn't folding. It was dual screen. Microsoft has like, the future of

628
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,860
Speaker 5:  everything is two screens.

629
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,100
Speaker 6:  And these are effectively kind of dual screen. Cause they fold. And then

630
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,090
Speaker 6:  you can use both screens in that weird folding way that you would never

631
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,080
Speaker 6:  use your Samsung galaxy folders. So I just, I think it's interesting

632
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,890
Speaker 6:  that they're still doing it despite not really as much support from

633
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,710
Speaker 6:  Microsoft because Microsoft was like, yeah, do this. And he's like telling

634
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,410
Speaker 6:  everybody, yeah, I do this. We all should have these. And then everybody

635
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,720
Speaker 6:  made them in Microsoft. Like, oh yeah, you think that's

636
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,710
Speaker 5:  The interesting thing about both of these, right? When you think about, okay,

637
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,640
Speaker 5:  it's a folding screen laptop, you think that you would open it like a regular

638
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,610
Speaker 5:  laptop and the bottom would be like a touch screen keyboard on top of you

639
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,700
Speaker 5:  the screen. And they could open it all the way and get the big display. And

640
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,150
Speaker 5:  here both companies are like, also we shoved a Bluetooth keyboard in the

641
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,990
Speaker 5:  middle of the sandwich because actually typing on a touch screen is no good.

642
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,130
Speaker 5:  So there's like both of them have like a little like a keyboard

643
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,300
Speaker 5:  Frisbee that you like sticking to it. And you can use it in the big tattle

644
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,470
Speaker 5:  mode with the keyboard in front.

645
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,400
Speaker 6:  Well, it's also to protect the display because these things are so big that

646
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,410
Speaker 6:  you can't fold them flat. Yeah.

647
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,830
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I just don't think we've hit the form factor of this if you still need

648
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,640
Speaker 5:  physical keys.

649
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,240
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

650
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,680
Speaker 1:  Right. It's like undercuts. The whole purpose of it is which is like, is

651
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,580
Speaker 1:  it even possible to do like a touch screen, haptic keyboard? That feels

652
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,780
Speaker 1:  good. I'm not positive that it is, but I think, yeah. It's

653
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,930
Speaker 1:  like, can we make a screen that folds, that doesn't look like trash? Like

654
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,750
Speaker 1:  the, these companies are starting to say like, yes we can. And then it's

655
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,680
Speaker 1:  like, how do we make this like an enjoyable device for you to use in all

656
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,250
Speaker 1:  of the ways that aren't just basically a big

657
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,880
Speaker 1:  tablet with a crappy Bluetooth keyboard. And we have not yet

658
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,930
Speaker 5:  In many ways, what they have made is like a super surface,

659
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,250
Speaker 5:  right? If you just had a big surface, like a Microsoft surface

660
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:32,240
Speaker 5:  tablet and it was just bigger. Yeah. Like they've accomplished that

661
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,010
Speaker 5:  goal, which is an interesting goal,

662
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,260
Speaker 1:  Which is something. But

663
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,610
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think the form factor of folding phones, I think has settled into

664
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,570
Speaker 5:  two camps. Right? There's big foam that gets smaller and big firm

665
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:46,350
Speaker 5:  that gets bigger. And I think with laptops, it's like weird laptop that gets

666
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:46,860
Speaker 5:  weirder

667
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,420
Speaker 5:  set. So he wanted,

668
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,290
Speaker 5:  I think there's a couple more rounds here of like figuring out what all this

669
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,230
Speaker 5:  screen is for and how you like, where he, the thing that had one is hilarious.

670
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,910
Speaker 5:  Cause it still has the ThinkPad nub.

671
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,080
Speaker 6:  That's the best part,

672
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,990
Speaker 5:  The track point. So it's like, there are so many ways to move the mouse on

673
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,260
Speaker 5:  this.

674
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,040
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It, just, to me, it feels like, like, you know, you see the people

675
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,980
Speaker 1:  at the coffee shop who like set up their laptop and then reach back into

676
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,770
Speaker 1:  their bag and pull out the keyboard and then reach back into their bag and

677
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,220
Speaker 1:  pull out the mouse. And it's like, okay, this to me is what failure looks

678
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,730
Speaker 1:  like. Like somebody needed the way bad product and convinced you to buy it.

679
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,760
Speaker 1:  If this is how you're having to use it. And to me, it's like, that's how

680
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,430
Speaker 1:  I feel about the foldables too. It's like, I will believe in these things

681
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,240
Speaker 1:  when I start to see people sitting at Starbucks, hammering away on the

682
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,330
Speaker 1:  screen without any other attachment, like if I need another piece,

683
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,350
Speaker 6:  Do you think it's more likely to be seen in a Starbucks in the next year?

684
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,100
Speaker 6:  People with these are people bringing like a full tower and monitor

685
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,390
Speaker 5:  Full tower? Yeah.

686
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,190
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

687
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,470
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

688
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,530
Speaker 6:  They're not going to steal that

689
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,120
Speaker 5:  Away. I've definitely seen somebody. I

690
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,070
Speaker 6:  Was just wondering like maybe, maybe it becomes popular.

691
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,770
Speaker 5:  I've definitely seen somebody bring a full iMac back to a coffee shop.

692
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,550
Speaker 6:  It's incredible. You just watch them. You're like they're coming in. It's

693
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,530
Speaker 6:  very clear what they're going to do. All right.

694
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,540
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's not subtle. What's about to happen here. The man has a

695
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,170
Speaker 5:  27 inch iMac and a determined look on his face.

696
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,840
Speaker 6:  He needs to buy so much coffee.

697
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,390
Speaker 5:  All right. Last one, ring Intercom. And that's also

698
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,000
Speaker 5:  <inaudible> going on. That's why there's so much gadget news. It's a big

699
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,810
Speaker 5:  gadget show in Europe.

700
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,630
Speaker 6:  So excited about this Intercom.

701
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,260
Speaker 5:  I don't quite understand this Intercom.

702
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,970
Speaker 6:  So I personally am excited because I have an Intercom in

703
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,450
Speaker 6:  my home and it's got three buttons on it. And one is to

704
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,800
Speaker 6:  yell at people. One is to hear people yell at me and

705
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,790
Speaker 6:  one is to open the door so they can come up and yell at me. It's very angry

706
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,720
Speaker 6:  in my neighborhood

707
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,460
Speaker 5:  Because they're kicking everybody all the time.

708
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,830
Speaker 6:  But this is meant to like work with those kinds of systems. It's

709
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,430
Speaker 6:  primarily focused in Europe right now because there's a lot more apartments.

710
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:00,330
Speaker 6:  They're all with intercoms. And so it's kind of like to give

711
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:04,020
Speaker 6:  you the ability that some of you guys have maybe where you can

712
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,440
Speaker 6:  just check on your phone. If somebody buzzes, I have to get up and like go

713
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,010
Speaker 6:  and find someone, and this will let you do it from your phone. Or like I

714
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,380
Speaker 6:  could do it from the office. If somebody was buzzing my house right now,

715
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,890
Speaker 6:  it could be like, yeah, you go drop the package off or no, I don't want your

716
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,740
Speaker 6:  urine. Take it to the place next door happens. So often

717
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:24,210
Speaker 1:  I actually, I think this is great. I don't want a

718
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:28,110
Speaker 1:  camera. And my wife is pretty religious about like, we just

719
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,320
Speaker 1:  don't have, we don't have cameras in or outside of the house. And I've like,

720
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,230
Speaker 1:  basically agreed with that rule. But having a thing that is still a

721
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,680
Speaker 1:  way to communicate with someone at the door is very useful. And also, I just

722
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,430
Speaker 1:  liked the idea that it's like, okay, lots of houses have doorbells. Lots

723
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,640
Speaker 1:  of houses have intercoms. All of them are always broken. It's just like,

724
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,720
Speaker 1:  it's just true. Like I have an Intercom in my house. My house

725
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,960
Speaker 1:  was built in like the sixties. It doesn't work. It probably never worked.

726
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,620
Speaker 1:  It just sits there. And I do nothing with it and bring, just shows up and

727
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,650
Speaker 1:  they're like, just stick this thing on top of it and pretend it works. Essentially.

728
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,100
Speaker 5:  I'm in kind of the most interesting trend in smart home stuff right now

729
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,180
Speaker 5:  is just retrofit hacks. So ring actually

730
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,900
Speaker 5:  started this trend a little bit. You can buy the retrofit kit. If you have

731
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,860
Speaker 5:  like an old school ADT alarm system, you can just buy a new brain and

732
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,800
Speaker 5:  wire, all the existing sensors into it and make it a, a ring system,

733
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,860
Speaker 5:  which is like complicated and weird. But I know some people who've done it.

734
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,580
Speaker 5:  They love it. You have to spend hours being like, I guess this is the motion

735
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,060
Speaker 5:  detector and like labeling stuff. But if you're a gadget nerd,

736
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,240
Speaker 6:  I was like, that sounds like that's my weekend.

737
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,020
Speaker 5:  Then there's like the touch spot stuff

738
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:38,800
Speaker 5:  where Jen just read about it. It's like a smart door lock, but it just like

739
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:42,670
Speaker 5:  bolts over the top of your existing door lock. And it just turns the handle.

740
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,730
Speaker 5:  Right. And then there's a bunch of stuff where there's just like a little

741
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,690
Speaker 5:  arm comes out and switches the light switch for you. And it's a bunch,

742
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,490
Speaker 5:  a bunch of that switch spot that's what's called

743
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,780
Speaker 6:  Tato. Is it? I think it's Tato is like the thermostat company that's

744
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,530
Speaker 6:  explicitly for like apartment heating systems,

745
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,610
Speaker 6:  radiators and stuff. Yeah.

746
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,760
Speaker 5:  Right. And it's just kind of like bolts onto the physical control.

747
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:07,270
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You put it on like the radiator and it like does the radiator thing

748
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,080
Speaker 6:  controls?

749
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,770
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, I, I, it's just funny that we kind of started with what if

750
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:15,100
Speaker 5:  we replace all the things with new things that are smart, we're going to

751
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,030
Speaker 5:  tear it all year olds. And now it's like, what if we just did little robots

752
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,720
Speaker 5:  to push the existing buttons? Cause that's all we really need to do here.

753
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,610
Speaker 5:  And so I just think it's like a really interesting trend that the industry

754
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:31,420
Speaker 5:  has given up on. We'll replace the inner calm in your house with,

755
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:35,590
Speaker 5:  or the door locks in your house with here's a little tiny motor. It's going

756
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,990
Speaker 5:  to push the button for you.

757
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,740
Speaker 1:  I just, I think everybody's spent a decade like vastly under

758
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,730
Speaker 1:  estimating how hard it is to convince

759
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,690
Speaker 1:  people, to like get out of screwdriver and do stuff. And it's just like,

760
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:54,100
Speaker 1:  like if this, this basically this ring Intercom huge, literally

761
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,370
Speaker 1:  it looks like just shove it over top of the existing thing like you're talking

762
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:00,910
Speaker 1:  about. And it's like, so many of these are just like, oh, your thermostat

763
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:04,330
Speaker 1:  is basically just like three wires and four screws in the wall. Just pull

764
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,900
Speaker 1:  it out, put in a nest, easy peasy, no problem. And I think most people look

765
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,740
Speaker 1:  at that knowing air,

766
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,130
Speaker 6:  Well, this one, I mean, this one you do have to do. It's similar to the nest

767
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,930
Speaker 6:  and that you do, you're going to have to do some wiring

768
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,940
Speaker 1:  Through, if you want to be able to open your door, you do

769
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,690
Speaker 6:  That. Like you're still going to have to go in and do

770
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,960
Speaker 6:  wires, but it's also same thing. It's like two to three wires. And I think

771
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,840
Speaker 6:  the big thing here, and that's something that, that Jen talked about in her

772
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,650
Speaker 6:  piece is that this is for renters. There's a lot of people who,

773
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,070
Speaker 6:  who can't install cool doorbells because their

774
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,000
Speaker 6:  landlord will be like, what are you doing? They can install

775
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,300
Speaker 6:  a lot of this stuff. And so the, these smaller things, they are like just

776
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,990
Speaker 6:  robots you stick on on the stuff that already exists is really, really useful.

777
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:48,830
Speaker 6:  Like it's what almost 40%. I think it's like 36% of Americans,

778
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:52,370
Speaker 6:  American households are renters. That's a big chunk of people that

779
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,180
Speaker 6:  don't have access to a whole lot of this like smart home, the smart home

780
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,840
Speaker 6:  trends. And this gives them, me access to that

781
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,140
Speaker 6:  eventually. Cause it's starting in the UK, it won't come to the U S until

782
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,010
Speaker 6:  next year. And it also, currently doesn't work with the inner

783
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,670
Speaker 6:  calm that I have in like 80% of new

784
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,330
Speaker 6:  Yorkers have that was like, put it in the sixties and is absolute garbage.

785
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,210
Speaker 6:  That's like do that one guy. So, so

786
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,590
Speaker 5:  You need three switch spots.

787
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:19,010
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

788
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,460
Speaker 5:  So that when your door buzzes, you like push the button. And it's like,

789
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,600
Speaker 6:  I was like looking into a project of like, can I get a raspberry pie and

790
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,840
Speaker 6:  like wired into this Intercom and do all of this stuff.

791
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,510
Speaker 6:  Yes. It would be incredible to anybody who rings. The

792
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,800
Speaker 6:  doorbell would be great.

793
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,580
Speaker 5:  All right, this segment has gone over. See I'm doing it. I'm trying to try

794
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,480
Speaker 5:  to ease the tension. The segment's gone over. I have to get to a meeting.

795
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,210
Speaker 5:  Y'all gonna take a break. And I believe you come back to Casey.

796
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:47,780
Speaker 10:  Yep.

797
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,970
Speaker 5:  That's it. We'll grab that.

798
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,810
Speaker 1:  If you run an e-commerce business, you might be laser focused on acquiring

799
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,350
Speaker 1:  new customers, which makes sense at face value until you realize that this

800
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,920
Speaker 1:  isn't necessarily the best business model. According to a Harvard study,

801
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,580
Speaker 1:  acquiring new customers can be anywhere from five to 25

802
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:14,360
Speaker 1:  times more expensive than retaining existing ones. That same study

803
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,780
Speaker 1:  also found that increasing customer retention rates by 5%

804
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,680
Speaker 1:  increases profits by up to 95%, keeping your customer base

805
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,370
Speaker 1:  engaged and happy is a good way to grow, which is what the Cleevio platform

806
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:29,180
Speaker 1:  can help you achieve. Klaviyo's email and SMS marketing platform brings all

00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,170

845
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,570
Speaker 1:  with Twitter? What happened?

846
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,680
Speaker 11:  Oh, well, I mean, yes, I was popping champagne at, at 8:00 AM

847
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,700
Speaker 11:  and they announced it at like five 40 this morning, but yes. And by the

848
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,420
Speaker 11:  way, the verge readers already know this, but Twitter after

849
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,560
Speaker 11:  18 years, ish has finally unveiled a way to

850
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,010
Speaker 11:  let you edit a tweet for up to 30 minutes

851
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:12,880
Speaker 11:  after it was posted in the face of enormous

852
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,780
Speaker 11:  opposition from some extremely annoying

853
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,500
Speaker 11:  people. This has been shipped and I am now dancing on the graves of my

854
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:20,980
Speaker 11:  hitters.

855
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,620
Speaker 6:  I'm so happy for you. I don't want it though. I don't want the

856
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:29,650
Speaker 6:  edit. I want everything to live in horror for all to see.

857
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,300
Speaker 6:  I want like just a Testament to my crimes on the internet.

858
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:38,860
Speaker 11:  I am happy to re-litigate all of the stupid arguments against the edit button.

859
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,640
Speaker 11:  I'm just here to tell everyone that you continue to be wrong and that every

860
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,300
Speaker 11:  other platform that creates a text box enables you to edit it

861
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:50,290
Speaker 11:  and democracy ain't dead yet, baby. So look,

862
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,130
Speaker 11:  will it create new problems? I'm sure, but we have

863
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,150
Speaker 11:  cases all the time where, you know, a half a percent of users abuse

864
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,780
Speaker 11:  the feature and we still let people, you know, that we still at the 99 and

865
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,930
Speaker 11:  a half percent of people enjoy the feature and 99 and a half percent of

866
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:07,780
Speaker 11:  people are going to really enjoy being able to fix a stupid typo.

867
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,590
Speaker 1:  Yes. Okay. So let, let me just, let me just lay out the like details of how

868
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,990
Speaker 1:  this works, because, because the most annoying thing about this announcement

869
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:17,200
Speaker 1:  to me was I have been staunchly against the edit button this whole time.

870
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,800
Speaker 1:  I have always thought it was a terrible idea. Hate it. Think it's the worst

871
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:23,830
Speaker 1:  bad idea. And then I read it today. And so basically the way that it works,

872
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,560
Speaker 1:  I'll just read from Twitter's blog posts. It says tweets will be able to

873
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,490
Speaker 1:  be edited a few times in the 30 minutes. Following publication edited

874
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:33,280
Speaker 1:  tweets will appear with an yeah, I don't know what a few means. We'll come

875
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,940
Speaker 1:  back to that in a second edited tweets will appear with an icon timestamp

876
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,970
Speaker 1:  and label. So it's clear to readers that the original tweet has been modified.

877
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,750
Speaker 1:  The edit label will have a complete edit history

878
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,170
Speaker 1:  and you'll be able to click into it and see all the past versions of the

879
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:47,650
Speaker 1:  edited tweet.

880
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,040
Speaker 6:  I love this. This sounds great now. Nevermind. Cause I just wanted, like,

881
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,270
Speaker 6:  I want all of my horror to be available. Like every typo I want you

882
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:59,170
Speaker 6:  all to know that I'm bad at typing. And so like, okay, the history is

883
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:02,320
Speaker 6:  there. I'm fine. Roll it out. Let's do it. Let's go.

884
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,220
Speaker 1:  So Alex, I would point out you're not required to edit your tweets. You don't

885
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,060
Speaker 1:  have to change.

886
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,200
Speaker 6:  I probably won't be real because it costs money too. Right? Like

887
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,880
Speaker 11:  Alex, you're an editor at the verge. You're an editor at the verge and you're

888
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,130
Speaker 11:  not going to edit your tweets. What kind of message does that send to your

889
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:18,610
Speaker 11:  employees?

890
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,660
Speaker 6:  Really good work-life balance. When I'm on Twitter, I'm at, I'm

891
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,620
Speaker 6:  at home. I'm having a great time. There are 40 typos in the

892
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,740
Speaker 6:  first sentence. It is illegible. That's the way it should

893
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,530
Speaker 1:  Know work-life balance like a lot of tweets, as far as a

894
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:36,370
Speaker 6:  Lot of illegible tweets at 2:00 AM that's work-life

895
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:37,090
Speaker 6:  balance, right there.

896
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:41,200
Speaker 11:  There's something that happened to me the other day. Yes. Can I share

897
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,890
Speaker 11:  something that speaks to the need for this? So this week

898
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,760
Speaker 11:  with my colleague, Zoe Schiffer at the verge, I, we wrote this

899
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,750
Speaker 11:  story that was very serious about Twitter, and it's a problem with

900
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:56,350
Speaker 11:  child sexual abuse material. And I wrote a follow-up to it yesterday

901
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,190
Speaker 11:  for my newsletter platformer about, about the

902
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:03,040
Speaker 11:  fact that apple, you know, might have something to say, if Twitter went,

903
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,800
Speaker 11:  went ahead with its plans to build an only fans competitor, which is something

904
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,460
Speaker 11:  that Twitter has been considering. So I tweeted out my newsletter and

905
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:13,000
Speaker 11:  w what I hear, I'm going to read it to you. What I tweeted out, I read about

906
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,910
Speaker 11:  another reason left out of the red team's report that Twitter might've hit

907
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:19,240
Speaker 11:  the brakes on its only fans, competitor fears. It would risk a crackdown

908
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,750
Speaker 11:  from apple over existing, poor on the platform.

909
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:26,650
Speaker 11:  He O O R. And so, no, you

910
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:28,780
Speaker 6:  Do not delete

911
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:33,550
Speaker 11:  Within three minutes. A bunch of people are tweeting. What do you mean poor

912
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,610
Speaker 11:  P what poor, you know? And I'm just like, what's happened. And then I see

913
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,550
Speaker 11:  I've made the typo, but of course, by now, the tweet has already started

914
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:43,360
Speaker 11:  travel. And so I just replied to the tweet with the single all

915
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,230
Speaker 11:  caps word porn, because obviously I meant porn. And then

916
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:49,840
Speaker 11:  that, you know, then people started quote, tweeting that, and just be like,

917
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:53,370
Speaker 11:  oh, look at what this tech journalist, you know, is tweeting about this

918
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:57,310
Speaker 11:  whole cycle of in this world. This problem is

919
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:01,240
Speaker 11:  now solved. I just go in and I change poor to porn

920
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,810
Speaker 11:  and my life is better. And that is how technology should work. It should

921
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,810
Speaker 11:  be in service of me. I should not be in service of Twitter. Twitter should

922
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:08,770
Speaker 11:  be in service of me.

923
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,550
Speaker 6:  I like is that I would still be able to go back, look at your edit

924
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:16,510
Speaker 6:  history screenshot that you originally wrote poor and be like, look at

925
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:20,020
Speaker 6:  this, look at this typo he first did. And that's important to me.

926
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:23,770
Speaker 6:  Like, I think we get the best of both worlds. You get to, you get to correct

927
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,530
Speaker 6:  it and I can be like, never forget.

928
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,700
Speaker 6:  It's perfect. I love it.

929
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,540
Speaker 11:  And that's fine. I am totally happy with that. Trade-off I'm totally happy

930
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,640
Speaker 11:  with that. Trade-off we need that audit trail, right? Because yes, you could,

931
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,140
Speaker 11:  you can imagine ways that this feature could be abused. I'm sure some people

932
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,100
Speaker 11:  will try to abuse it. I just think that the number of times that that

933
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:46,970
Speaker 11:  happens is going to be smaller than the haters say. And I think the consequences

934
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:49,430
Speaker 11:  of it happening are going to be much less than, than people say.

935
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:53,330
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Okay. So let's, let's just play out the worst case scenario of this

936
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,920
Speaker 1:  for a minute. Cause I think this is the thing I've, I'm thinking about a

937
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,700
Speaker 1:  lot because I think

938
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:56,510
Speaker 6:  What goes wrong.

939
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:00,530
Speaker 1:  There is this instinct that I have also had many times that this

940
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:03,230
Speaker 1:  is like an inherently bad idea. Right? And it's like, somebody who's going

941
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,660
Speaker 1:  to embed a tweet on a website and then you can change it. No, no, everything's

942
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:09,320
Speaker 1:  awful. But like, you've talked to a lot of people who like work at Twitter

943
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,310
Speaker 1:  and think about this stuff about this stuff, right? Like what is literally

944
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,950
Speaker 1:  the worst that could happen here is your sense.

945
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,520
Speaker 11:  Donald Trump could become president again in 2024

946
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,810
Speaker 6:  And they give him his Twitter back or just, just these precedent, which is

947
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:24,260
Speaker 6:  worse.

948
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,370
Speaker 11:  No, that's just like, just like any, any bad platform

949
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,670
Speaker 11:  decision to me, like the worst case scenario is Donald Trump becomes president.

950
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,750
Speaker 11:  Now. I don't think that will probably happen in this case,

951
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:38,630
Speaker 11:  but you know, here, I mean, here's what people, you know, people talk a

952
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:42,200
Speaker 11:  lot about like, well, could you use this to change the market

953
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,920
Speaker 11:  somehow? Like if you said, oh, you

954
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,610
Speaker 11:  know, the, the CEO of a, of a tech giant just

955
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:53,030
Speaker 11:  died to like crash the market and then it goes viral. But then you

956
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:57,160
Speaker 11:  change the tweet to like a crypto scam or something. Like, I

957
00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:00,080
Speaker 11:  don't know exactly what, what people think is going to happen. I think it's

958
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,470
Speaker 11:  important to note that they only have 30 minutes to change it, which means

959
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:07,130
Speaker 11:  that your tweet can only get so viral in 30 minutes. And yes, tweets do

960
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:11,060
Speaker 11:  go viral in 30 minutes, but like a manageable number. Right? So if

961
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,960
Speaker 11:  Twitter sees some tweet going crazy bananas numbers and like the first

962
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,390
Speaker 11:  five minutes, they can probably get a set of eyeballs on it and just be

963
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:20,510
Speaker 11:  like, okay, is this, is this a verified actor? Is this an account that has

964
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:24,500
Speaker 11:  been taken over? So there, there will have to be an enforcement layer, but

965
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,060
Speaker 11:  like, these are the kinds of things.

966
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,410
Speaker 6:  No, I'm just thinking about the crypto scheme, like really viral tweet. And

967
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:33,680
Speaker 6:  you're like, all right, switch it out. Now I'm going to rake in the dough.

968
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:37,010
Speaker 6:  Right. I assume that's how those screams work. Yeah.

969
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,730
Speaker 11:  Th this is my issue is like, oh, you know, well, now that there's this edit

970
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,270
Speaker 11:  feature, it's like, what do people try to do bad things on Twitter? What

971
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,640
Speaker 11:  do they try to promote crypto scams? You know, or what if they try to like

972
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,270
Speaker 11:  PR promote hate speech and say it's already happening, you know? And that's

973
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:53,270
Speaker 11:  not to say that we should necessarily do things to make it worse. It's just

974
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,750
Speaker 11:  that Twitter has policies and enforcement teams in place

975
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,800
Speaker 11:  to manage the bad actors. So look, if your argument against us

976
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,400
Speaker 11:  is you think it's a great idea and the feature seems technologically well-designed,

977
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,100
Speaker 11:  but Twitter is a battered shell of its former self. And there's no way it

978
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,790
Speaker 11:  can enforce like some new set of features like

979
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:13,640
Speaker 11:  this. I don't think that's actually that bad of an argument to me, that's

980
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,330
Speaker 11:  probably the best argument, but is it worth a, try to the like

981
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:21,170
Speaker 11:  500 people who pay for Twitter Ballou? Like I think, yes. Why don't we

982
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,810
Speaker 11:  just roll it out to 500 people and see how they use it

983
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:28,080
Speaker 1:  Yet? So I will say do by the logic of making it a Twitter blue

984
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,660
Speaker 1:  thing, actually, because I think it's like, it's a relatively self-selecting

985
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,110
Speaker 1:  group of people who are probably more likely than average to like,

986
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,770
Speaker 1:  not try to abuse the system. And it's also a group of people who are like,

987
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,820
Speaker 1:  by definition, going to be paid more attention to by Twitter as a

988
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:45,450
Speaker 1:  platform. So like all the random, you know,

989
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,440
Speaker 1:  I'm going to laugh when like a million Russian bots I'll start getting Twitter

990
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,200
Speaker 1:  blue. It's going to be like incredible for Twitter's revenue. It's like,

991
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:52,950
Speaker 1:  incredible

992
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:57,270
Speaker 6:  Is Elon Musk on Twitter blue? Like, does he pay $5 a month for the edit,

993
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:57,420
Speaker 6:  but

994
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:58,470
Speaker 11:  Not to my knowledge,

995
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,590
Speaker 1:  $10 a month. And you get the fire hose is, is what happens.

996
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,890
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You will be paying 44 billion soon, but

997
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,660
Speaker 6:  he's got to start paying now. No, I think my initial

998
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,660
Speaker 6:  concern about this was always that, that, that tumbler thing where tumbler

999
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,840
Speaker 6:  were like, yeah, you can edit all of your tumblers, which was a delight because

1000
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,500
Speaker 6:  people were just like, I'm going to put hardcore porn in. I'm just going

1001
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,130
Speaker 6:  to replace this viral tumbler post with hardcore porn. And it was hysterical

1002
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:27,120
Speaker 6:  also, like, don't look at Tableau at work. So, but,

1003
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,820
Speaker 6:  but this sounds like it really solves a lot of those problems because there

1004
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:33,510
Speaker 6:  is like that, that time period there is that like

1005
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,830
Speaker 6:  kind of watching it happen, like somebody is monitoring this

1006
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,300
Speaker 6:  to some extent.

1007
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,860
Speaker 11:  Yeah. And Twitter doesn't have to invent the whole wheel here. Right?

1008
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,920
Speaker 11:  It's like, you can edit a Facebook post. You can edit a slack post, you

1009
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,760
Speaker 11:  can edit a discord post. Like this is not a brand new technology

1010
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,360
Speaker 11:  that has like been invented in the deepest recesses of

1011
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,320
Speaker 11:  Frankenstein's lab. Like we know how to build editing features. And

1012
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,860
Speaker 11:  frankly, I think the reaction against it has, has legitimately been

1013
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,280
Speaker 11:  hysterical. Like, I feel like I'm like listening to a bunch of like people

1014
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,090
Speaker 11:  in like 1901 reacting against the, the creation of the telephone.

1015
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:13,380
Speaker 1:  But I will say the thing that's different about that is like one thing that

1016
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,140
Speaker 1:  is different about Twitter than all the other things you just named is that

1017
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:19,860
Speaker 1:  like a lot of people experienced Twitter, not on Twitter. Right. There's

1018
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,850
Speaker 1:  like, there's, there's the there's embeds, which is how a lot of people experience

1019
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:27,450
Speaker 1:  Twitter. There's like third-party apps. Twitter is like theoretically back

1020
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,540
Speaker 1:  to, you know, giving a crap about third-party developers for the

1021
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:34,680
Speaker 1:  11th time. And I'm sure it'll change its mind again. Yeah. But

1022
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,580
Speaker 1:  like, it's the kind of thing that I think is like much easier to do

1023
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:42,210
Speaker 1:  when people are, are coming to your place to do this stuff. But if you are

1024
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:46,050
Speaker 1:  this kind of distributed machine, which is what Twitter is, it's, it's

1025
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:49,950
Speaker 1:  not impossible. It's just a harder thing to propagate in a way

1026
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:51,300
Speaker 1:  that like makes sense. I think,

1027
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,660
Speaker 6:  Well, I think this doesn't like solve some of those key problems with like,

1028
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,200
Speaker 6:  people love to trade those screenshots. Right? That's that's like a really

1029
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,920
Speaker 6:  popular way to like interact with Twitter is take a

1030
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,280
Speaker 6:  screenshot and post it. And this isn't going to necessarily solve that. Like,

1031
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:08,730
Speaker 6:  I will absolutely be able to screenshot Casey's poor tweet

1032
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,510
Speaker 6:  and like distributed to the wide world. But

1033
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,290
Speaker 6:  like, I think that they found, it sounds like they found kind of a nice middle

1034
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:19,830
Speaker 6:  ground. I'm learning all about this on the verge cast as we speak,

1035
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,260
Speaker 6:  this is, this is great news for me personally. Thank you, Casey.

1036
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,300
Speaker 11:  I mean, this, I come here to educate, this is what got me excited

1037
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,780
Speaker 11:  about podcasts in the first place. So happy to be here,

1038
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:36,310
Speaker 11:  but yeah, let's, let's give it a shot. People let's be open to the idea

1039
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,770
Speaker 11:  that maybe somethings can work sometimes. How about back

1040
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,450
Speaker 6:  In a work with DMS?

1041
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:44,170
Speaker 1:  No. Twitter, Twitter has never, for five consecutive minutes, Twitter has

1042
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:47,440
Speaker 1:  never cared about DMS. I refuse to believe that Twitter even knows DMS exists

1043
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,450
Speaker 1:  on this platform. Like it's not, I

1044
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:51,790
Speaker 11:  Don't think to start. It is going to work with DMS. I

1045
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,230
Speaker 6:  Use them so much.

1046
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:57,250
Speaker 1:  Dams are great. It's the worst messaging app on planet earth, but everyone's

1047
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,730
Speaker 1:  there. So it's fine. It does the job. But I have to say the thing that is

1048
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:03,340
Speaker 1:  the most annoying about this to me is that it actually seems like Twitter,

1049
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,850
Speaker 1:  like really thought this all the way through which to be honest is like a

1050
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,630
Speaker 1:  real bummer because Twitter, nobody does product more

1051
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,810
Speaker 1:  chaotically than Twitter. They're just like, here's a bunch of stuff. We're

1052
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:16,750
Speaker 1:  going to test it with 12 people, but we're going to tell everyone about it

1053
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,750
Speaker 1:  for some reason. And we're going to leak all of it accidentally to Jane Wong.

1054
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,380
Speaker 1:  Everything's going to be insane. Here's some stuff is like the Twitter way.

1055
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,470
Speaker 1:  And this one is like, I read through the blog posts and it's like, oh, you

1056
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:30,400
Speaker 1:  like really like, did your homework and thought this through. And I wonder

1057
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,160
Speaker 1:  if 30 minutes turns out to be the right answer. And like we were saying before,

1058
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,910
Speaker 1:  I wonder what a few times is like who, and that's, that's a, that's

1059
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:37,570
Speaker 1:  not a number.

1060
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,170
Speaker 11:  Well, just real quick. I just want to say, I've been talking to them about

1061
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:45,160
Speaker 11:  this in 2018. I mean like ever since Kayvon baker became the

1062
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,120
Speaker 11:  product manager, I was like lobbying him in person to think about this.

1063
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,840
Speaker 11:  And it was very much on his mind already. This is the number one.

1064
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:56,950
Speaker 11:  This is the number one request from the Twitter user. Oh, it's such a niche

1065
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:00,700
Speaker 11:  thing. It is literally the number one thing that people ask Twitter

1066
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:04,570
Speaker 11:  to build. Okay. So a lot of the haters are asking Twitter to ignore

1067
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:08,140
Speaker 11:  the number one request from its user base. Right. But there, they were thinking

1068
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:10,990
Speaker 11:  about it for four years. So if it, if it feels thoughtful and Polish it's

1069
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,780
Speaker 11:  because of this has been like a four year project.

1070
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:17,950
Speaker 6:  So like that was one of the things I did want to ask you is one of the

1071
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,730
Speaker 6:  running jokes in the world is that anytime Twitter needs like a get out of

1072
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:25,120
Speaker 6:  jail free card and completely change the conversation about the company,

1073
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,350
Speaker 6:  it can just be a finally like edit button here and conversation

1074
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:33,220
Speaker 6:  real bad about Twitter this weekend. Last partially, thanks

1075
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,580
Speaker 6:  to great reporting from you and Zoe, is this timing

1076
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,780
Speaker 6:  coincidental or maybe a little more intentional,

1077
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:45,370
Speaker 11:  You know, in, in my experience, most timing

1078
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:49,210
Speaker 11:  related to product is coincidental because it's just too hard to like line

1079
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:53,200
Speaker 11:  up the tracks to like get the thing ready out, to be out the door

1080
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,100
Speaker 11:  in time, to align with a news cycle that said, I think they

1081
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,910
Speaker 11:  are under pressure to show that they can build things. And morale internally

1082
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:04,780
Speaker 11:  is so bad that I think they probably did say, can we get this

1083
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,810
Speaker 11:  out the door? Because this would be a win and we can, we can sort of give

1084
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,570
Speaker 11:  the team a moment to feel like, look, we're doing some good, we're giving

1085
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:14,440
Speaker 11:  our customers what they want. We, we still have some life

1086
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,680
Speaker 11:  in us yet. So if anything, I imagine this is something they

1087
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,290
Speaker 11:  prioritize to sort of rally the troops internally.

1088
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:20,980
Speaker 6:  Oh, that's,

1089
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,190
Speaker 1:  That's a really interesting point because I think, I mean, what the last

1090
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:29,180
Speaker 1:  four months now have just been like a,

1091
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,710
Speaker 1:  I dunno, shit show seems like under selling, what's going on inside of Twitter.

1092
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:37,820
Speaker 1:  And there's been all this stuff about like, you know, getting rid of longterm

1093
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,790
Speaker 1:  product stuff and they fired a bunch of product people, including Kayvon,

1094
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:44,630
Speaker 1:  like you were talking about, like it, I can imagine somewhere

1095
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:48,560
Speaker 1:  that there has been like a big, big edit button billboard that now

1096
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,310
Speaker 1:  somebody gets to like, you know, throw out a windows in a celebratory

1097
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:55,100
Speaker 1:  manner. And this is like the wind that they've been waiting for for a long

1098
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,230
Speaker 1:  time. I can absolutely see that being the case.

1099
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,090
Speaker 11:  Have you seen the end of stranger things season four, like the most

1100
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:04,880
Speaker 11:  recent season, and I guess this will be a spoiler. So if you don't want

1101
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,420
Speaker 11:  to know how it ends, maybe skip forward 30 seconds. You know how the final

1102
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:12,350
Speaker 11:  shot of the season is like all of the good guys are like

1103
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:16,160
Speaker 11:  looking out on the horizon and the like a tear has opened in space and time.

1104
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,060
Speaker 11:  And the upside down is started to invade and take over Hawkins. Like

1105
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:23,330
Speaker 11:  that is, that is what the Twitter people have felt like for the last four

1106
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:26,990
Speaker 11:  months. It's like a giant rip in space sometime time called Elon

1107
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:30,950
Speaker 11:  Musk appeared over the horizon and is now just swallowing up

1108
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,450
Speaker 11:  the entire reality.

1109
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:36,530
Speaker 1:  And the edit button is like the peanut butter sandwich that you get to eat

1110
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,830
Speaker 1:  during the day. It's like, we can't make this all better, but like, here's

1111
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:40,250
Speaker 1:  a peanut butter

1112
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:44,300
Speaker 6:  Peanut butter sandwich. It was made by Ooma Thurman's daughter. It's

1113
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:44,720
Speaker 6:  great.

1114
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,370
Speaker 6:  Spoilers. Sorry, keep fast-forwarding guys. You're fine.

1115
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,730
Speaker 1:  Okay. So before we take a break and get into some of other stuff going on,

1116
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,820
Speaker 1:  what, what do you know internally about what took so long here? Like this

1117
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,850
Speaker 1:  is a four year long project, to your point. It is the most

1118
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:02,810
Speaker 1:  requested thing, which I actually think says a lot about how it's going to

1119
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:05,420
Speaker 1:  be used. Like to your point about there will be people who abuse it. Like

1120
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:10,130
Speaker 1:  most people are not in this to like ruin democracy. Most people are

1121
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:13,070
Speaker 1:  in this to fix their dumb tweets. And so in that sense, like, I am willing

1122
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:16,760
Speaker 1:  to give this an actual chance to help regular people fix their regular

1123
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,330
Speaker 1:  tweets. Why did this take four years? Then this is actually not that complicated

1124
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:21,350
Speaker 1:  a thing. What the hell is going on here?

1125
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,100
Speaker 11:  Well, you know, Twitter was just never built to do this, right. I mean,

1126
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:29,000
Speaker 11:  the original tweets were sent over SMS. You can't edit SMS. Right. So

1127
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,510
Speaker 11:  it was just bill on a system that never anticipated that anything would

1128
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:36,320
Speaker 11:  ever be edited. Yes. And you would be amazed at how

1129
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,870
Speaker 11:  many systems at Twitter are 18 years old,

1130
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:44,270
Speaker 11:  but yeah. So they had to sort of, you know, build the, the, the basic

1131
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:48,020
Speaker 11:  editing features. They had to build like an audit trail, right. There was

1132
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:51,620
Speaker 11:  visual design. They had to really think through what is the

1133
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,680
Speaker 11:  timer we're going to set on this thing. And then they had to think about,

1134
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,380
Speaker 11:  well, how are we going to roll it out as, as something that we do with a

1135
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,170
Speaker 11:  test group. And then, you know, they decided to do Twitter, blue, Twitter,

1136
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:03,410
Speaker 11:  blue didn't even exist until last year. Right. We're sort of gave them a

1137
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,610
Speaker 11:  sort of audience, you know, that, that maybe they could test this out

1138
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:10,190
Speaker 11:  with and in a productive way. So there are a lot of things to line up. Now,

1139
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:13,310
Speaker 11:  all that said, do I think this feature should have been available in 2010?

1140
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,890
Speaker 11:  Yes, I absolutely do. But that's why it took as long as it did.

1141
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:19,740
Speaker 1:  Fair enough. Well, I look forward to all of us abusing it. Horrifically,

1142
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:23,520
Speaker 1:  Alex, you have said on the podcast that you're not ever going to change any

1143
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,720
Speaker 1:  of your tweets, so you are not allowed to do.

1144
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,050
Speaker 6:  I am not allowed to use it, but I will be screenshotting all of your edit

1145
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:31,980
Speaker 6:  histories. Just be ready. I don't want, I also

1146
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:34,500
Speaker 6:  it's $5 a month. Like,

1147
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:37,260
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's more expensive now. They're like, oh, you want to edit tweets?

1148
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,610
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Give us some money.

1149
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,900
Speaker 6:  No, I mean, unless I do some really egregious ones, my

1150
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,750
Speaker 6:  typos are normally legible enough. You can, you can like

1151
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,180
Speaker 6:  interpret them. It'll be fine.

1152
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:51,390
Speaker 11:  What can I, can I tell you guys my idea for a, what they should rebrand

1153
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:52,080
Speaker 11:  Twitter blew as

1154
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,460
Speaker 1:  Yes. Go.

1155
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:56,940
Speaker 11:  I think they should just call it the Twitter legal defense fund. And I think

1156
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,200
Speaker 11:  they would make 10 times as much money.

1157
01:02:59,160 --> 01:02:59,790
Speaker 6:  It would.

1158
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,450
Speaker 1:  Yeah. The, the Elon Musk blocking situation,

1159
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,060
Speaker 6:  I really am excited for the moment he edits a tweet because he's gonna

1160
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:12,000
Speaker 6:  do it. He is gonna subscribe and he's gonna edit. And then we're all

1161
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,390
Speaker 6:  going to be like, why are you giving them money? You won't give them money,

1162
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:18,150
Speaker 6:  but you'll give them $5 a month. Yvonne, what the hell

1163
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:22,170
Speaker 1:  Through power move would be to like specifically gate

1164
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:25,980
Speaker 1:  out Elon Musk from this test so that he is like the last person on

1165
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:29,850
Speaker 1:  Twitter to get access to this. It just, it would just be like, he

1166
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:33,140
Speaker 1:  would, you know, he would complain like every single day about now. And they'd

1167
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:36,270
Speaker 1:  be like, sorry, it's just a test. And he'd be like, what do you mean? 300 million

1168
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,360
Speaker 1:  people have this Twitter doesn't even have that many users. How are you doing

1169
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,130
Speaker 1:  this? I'm the only one were like

1170
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,050
Speaker 6:  Super random that you were the last person chosen.

1171
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,300
Speaker 1:  What are the odds?

1172
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,290
Speaker 6:  So rad.

1173
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,440
Speaker 6:  Some mathematician could like make that work. If

1174
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,350
Speaker 6:  you're that mathematician, please email Nila.

1175
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:59,190
Speaker 6:  He'll be really excited to learn more about this conversation.

1176
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,010
Speaker 1:  There you go. All right, we should take a break. There's a bunch of more

1177
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:05,610
Speaker 1:  social stuff stuck to you. So Casey, stick her out. We we'll be right back.

1178
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:14,730
Speaker 7:  Big wireless companies have used confusing contracts to hide fees and

1179
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:18,510
Speaker 7:  fine print and charge more money for way too long. We've all seen it

1180
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:21,540
Speaker 7:  happen. You sign up for a plan at the advertised price. And then when you

1181
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,990
Speaker 7:  get the bill, it's completely different. This is one of the reasons I signed

1182
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:28,650
Speaker 7:  up for mint mobile. It offers premium wireless starting at just 15 bucks

1183
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:32,640
Speaker 7:  a month. And I figured there would be some hidden fees, but I read the contract

1184
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:36,570
Speaker 7:  twice and there aren't any. And here's why mint mobile cut out. The one

1185
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:40,110
Speaker 7:  middleman big wireless still relies on in-person retail.

1186
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:44,310
Speaker 7:  Every plan gets you high-speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5g

1187
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:48,120
Speaker 7:  network. Plus unlimited talk and text. Keep your phone, keep your

1188
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:52,020
Speaker 7:  number, just change your provider to mint mobile, to get your new wireless

1189
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,560
Speaker 7:  plan for just 15 bucks a month and get the plan shipped to your door for

1190
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:59,400
Speaker 7:  free. Go to mint, mobile.com/verge that's mint,

1193
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,370
Speaker 12:  This is the advertiser content from knob Creek.

1194
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:16,230
Speaker 12:  My name is Fred. No, my family has been making whiskey since

1195
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:20,050
Speaker 12:  1795. Well, when I enjoy a glass of

1196
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:23,850
Speaker 12:  knob Creek, the first thing I do, you know, I put my nose into it, looking

1197
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:27,700
Speaker 12:  at it. And to me, the vanilla notes

1198
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:32,170
Speaker 12:  kind of jump out of the glass. When why don't barrels are used

1199
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:36,430
Speaker 12:  to age whiskey, you're going to get vanillin, which is

1200
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:39,730
Speaker 12:  in white Oak. And that makes the vanilla

1201
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:43,720
Speaker 12:  flavor and smell that you pick up, come out of the

1202
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,590
Speaker 12:  wood. It's in the wood, very distinctive and knob Creek. I

1203
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:51,400
Speaker 12:  think it's the marrying of all of these flavors,

1204
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:55,420
Speaker 12:  the sweetness and the oakiness that makes knob

1205
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,240
Speaker 12:  Creek. One of my favorites to sip and savor

1206
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,900
Speaker 13:  Must be 21 years or older drink, responsibly knob Creek, Kentucky, straight

1207
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,650
Speaker 13:  bourbon whiskey, 50% alcohol by volume, copyright 2022 James

1208
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,750
Speaker 13:  beam, distilling company, Clermont, Kentucky.

1209
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:16,370
Speaker 1:  Welcome back. Like I said, there's a bunch of more social news. The

1210
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:19,610
Speaker 1:  biggest there's a lot more. Yeah. There's like a surprising amount of social

1211
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,980
Speaker 1:  stuff going on. It's just like the week before labor day, everybody's supposed

1212
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:24,890
Speaker 1:  to be on vacation. I don't understand why this turned out to be like a shockingly

1213
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:28,250
Speaker 1:  newsy week. But anyway, snap is probably the next one. We should talk about

1214
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,360
Speaker 1:  Alex, what's going on with snap.

1215
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,960
Speaker 6:  So snap Alex, Heath reported to this. He broke the news for us,

1216
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:37,550
Speaker 6:  but unfortunately they're going to be laying off 20% of their employees

1217
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:41,450
Speaker 6:  particularly hit hard is their hardware team, which like just had that little

1218
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:44,930
Speaker 6:  cute drone that they immediately canceled. What, four months later, was it

1219
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:45,230
Speaker 6:  four months?

1220
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,500
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I'm very sad about that. Yeah. It, it, it launched

1221
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:52,640
Speaker 1:  effectively like yesterday and is now gone and

1222
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,570
Speaker 1:  yeah, so snap has 6,400 employees. It's laying off 20% of them, which

1223
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:58,430
Speaker 1:  is like an enormous number of people that

1224
01:06:58,430 --> 01:06:59,240
Speaker 6:  Is a lot of people.

1225
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:02,180
Speaker 1:  And it's not just hardware. We should say like a lot of it is hardware with

1226
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,870
Speaker 1:  snap is also canceling a bunch of its original discover shows. It's

1227
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:09,680
Speaker 1:  killing. I think the minis project, which I always thought was

1228
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:13,250
Speaker 1:  mifty and then a bunch of other projects. And it's basically saying like,

1229
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:17,060
Speaker 1:  if it's not directly contributing to how we make money right now, or

1230
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:20,780
Speaker 1:  augmented reality, which is hilarious, we're not interested in it.

1231
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:23,540
Speaker 1:  Casey, what do you, what do you make of all this what's going on at snap?

1232
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:28,160
Speaker 11:  I think it's really sad. You know, I feel like yesterday when all this was

1233
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,460
Speaker 11:  announced, basically three quarters of the things that the company had ever

1234
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:35,420
Speaker 11:  briefed me about just went away. The only thing in there that

1235
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:39,260
Speaker 11:  felt like slightly like a vindication was that

1236
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:43,190
Speaker 11:  they got rid of their original shows, which, which I, I, you know, I'm not

1237
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:46,310
Speaker 11:  saying, cause I wanted them to go away. It's just that the company had always

1238
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:49,760
Speaker 11:  touted how many views they had, oh, you know, 10 million people watched

1239
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,030
Speaker 11:  this. And I was just like, if, if literally tens of millions of people are

1240
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:55,850
Speaker 11:  watching these shows, they would have some cultural footprint whatsoever.

1241
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:58,970
Speaker 11:  And it's like, none of these have ever been mentioned anywhere. Right.

1242
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,800
Speaker 11:  And so I sort of felt like reality finally caught up with the snap originals,

1243
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,910
Speaker 11:  but like I thought that drone was fricking cool. I love the

1244
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:11,720
Speaker 11:  zenlea app. And then of course, you know, just always sucks

1245
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:14,990
Speaker 11:  when a bunch of people lose their jobs. So, you know, the, the reason I

1246
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:18,950
Speaker 11:  value snap as a company is that it is very creative compared to its peers.

1247
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:22,730
Speaker 11:  And it tries stuff that, that other companies don't. And so to see

1248
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:26,570
Speaker 11:  them losing some of those creative planks of the company, I just think was

1249
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:29,090
Speaker 11:  really sad. And I hope they've figured out a way to bounce back.

1250
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:33,620
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Wait, you mentioned zenlea, which is an app that if I'm being

1251
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:37,130
Speaker 1:  completely honest, I only discovered on the day that snap announced it was

1252
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:40,940
Speaker 1:  shutting down and then there's another one voicey spelled with like an

1253
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:43,880
Speaker 1:  S, which I thought, which is also getting shit. What are these apps? Like?

1254
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,790
Speaker 1:  I had no idea. Snap had other apps that it was running.

1255
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:50,790
Speaker 11:  Zen only is an app that you,

1256
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:54,590
Speaker 11:  it was kind of like, like, imagine it find your friends on iOS

1257
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:58,490
Speaker 11:  was created by a bunch of like cools

1258
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:01,790
Speaker 11:  zoomers like that. That was only, it was really slick. Really.

1259
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:05,360
Speaker 11:  Well-designed really fun. You could see where your friends were. You'd like,

1260
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:08,420
Speaker 11:  get an alert if they left the country or when they came back into the country,

1261
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,880
Speaker 11:  you know, it would sort of show you where your friends were and like what

1262
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:14,030
Speaker 11:  the battery life of their phone was and like how long they had been wearing

1263
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:17,240
Speaker 11:  it. So it's like very sort of intimate, invasive stuff that like a company

1264
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,870
Speaker 11:  like Facebook could never get away with building, but snap, because it's

1265
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:24,290
Speaker 11:  sort of limited to your real friends has a lot more trust with its users.

1266
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:27,410
Speaker 11:  They could build something like that. And this was apparently really popular

1267
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:30,560
Speaker 11:  in Europe. Like apparently 3 million people downloaded the loaded it last

1268
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,090
Speaker 11:  month alone. So the things still had some legs. Voicey was like a, like

1269
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:38,050
Speaker 11:  a music making app that I don't really understand very well myself. And

1270
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:41,000
Speaker 11:  it doesn't seem like it was nearly as popular, but like zenlea was something

1271
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,380
Speaker 11:  that people legitimately liked a lot.

1272
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:46,820
Speaker 6:  Is this good? I was gonna say, is this the right move for snap?

1273
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:50,720
Speaker 6:  Like, to me, it almost feels kind of silly that they're saying, okay,

1274
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,420
Speaker 6:  we were branching out into all these other places because we only have like

1275
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:57,800
Speaker 6:  so much road ahead of us with, with our core product. And instead they're

1276
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,220
Speaker 6:  like, now we're going to just invest in our core product and kill all these

1277
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:05,030
Speaker 6:  potentially successful things. Blake, oftentimes before they even had a chance

1278
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:08,780
Speaker 6:  to really like even try it, it feels a little goofy to me. But

1279
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,430
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I mean, so the thing about zenlea in particular

1280
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:17,330
Speaker 11:  is that snap does have the snap map. If you open up Snapchat, there is

1281
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:21,140
Speaker 11:  a map that shows you where your friends are. And so I think if you're

1282
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:24,920
Speaker 11:  Evan Spiegel and you have, you know, rapidly shrinking revenue and an

1283
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,640
Speaker 11:  uncertain outlook for the future, and you have two teams building a

1284
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,330
Speaker 11:  map, it's probably easy call to say, we should build one map.

1285
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:36,620
Speaker 11:  So I get it in that, in that sense. And I hope that they do import a

1286
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:39,980
Speaker 11:  lot of that Zen lead DNA into the snap map because zenlea feels like it's,

1287
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:43,010
Speaker 11:  you know, 10 years ahead of where the snap map is right now. So I think

1288
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:46,940
Speaker 11:  that's why they made that decision in particular. But again, it

1289
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:49,430
Speaker 11:  would have been nice if they had figured out something else to do with it.

1290
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:53,600
Speaker 1:  I feel like more broadly, this feels like, and

1291
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:57,500
Speaker 1:  I say all of this, knowing that like the economy is complicated right

1292
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,950
Speaker 1:  now, everybody's nervous about what the next couple of years are gonna look

1293
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:04,730
Speaker 1:  like. And this is a lot easier said than done. But if I were running snap,

1294
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:07,880
Speaker 1:  I would be looking for every excuse right now to like

1295
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:12,410
Speaker 1:  try to Zig or dig where others are zagging

1296
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:16,560
Speaker 1:  and to be the one to really push into stuff right now. Right? Like

1297
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,730
Speaker 1:  Snap's whole thing for a decade has been that it is just

1298
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:24,510
Speaker 1:  fast followed by every other company and they all just eat it alive

1299
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:28,530
Speaker 1:  because they have the scale and the ad business. And now all of those

1300
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:32,340
Speaker 1:  other companies Metta in particular is like retrenching because

1301
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,420
Speaker 1:  it cares only about the metaverse and reels. And so

1302
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:40,470
Speaker 1:  if I'm snap, it's like, this is the moment to sort of push ahead with

1303
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:44,190
Speaker 1:  everything you can think of to try and differentiate. When you have some

1304
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:47,880
Speaker 1:  real runway to differentiate where there's not just a team of 10,000 Instagram

1305
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,000
Speaker 1:  engineers ready to build everything you ship, the minute that you ship it.

1306
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:54,630
Speaker 1:  It just seems like, I don't know. I mean, a 20% is an

1307
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:58,590
Speaker 1:  enormous number of people to lay off at your company. Like at a

1308
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:02,400
Speaker 1:  company that big 20% is a huge number of people, which makes me think they

1309
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,980
Speaker 1:  are really nervous about what the next few years are going to look like.

1310
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:09,060
Speaker 1:  But it also seems like if ever there was going to be a moment for snap to

1311
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:12,960
Speaker 1:  really try to play offense when everybody else is playing defense, this

1312
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,840
Speaker 1:  should have been it. And it's just a bummer that that is not how it's going

1313
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,350
Speaker 1:  to shake out.

1314
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,700
Speaker 11:  Yeah. So I think they are playing offense when it comes to

1315
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,690
Speaker 11:  augmented reality, but that's so expensive because it's this

1316
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:28,650
Speaker 11:  like frontier technology where you're trying to solve problems of physics.

1317
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:33,240
Speaker 11:  And so it was just enormously expensive and snap isn't that

1318
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:37,170
Speaker 11:  big. And so they can only afford to play offense in like

1319
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:41,070
Speaker 11:  one or two places right now. And, and they've sort of made

1320
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:44,940
Speaker 11:  their bet. So it's, it's, you know, it really interesting to think about

1321
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,700
Speaker 11:  like sort of mark Zuckerberg and Evan Spiegel, obviously Facebook in a much

1322
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:51,150
Speaker 11:  better financial position, but both of them are betting their companies

1323
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:54,960
Speaker 11:  on this AR stuff in a way that really is risking the

1324
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,590
Speaker 11:  future of the company. I mean, these are very, these are very bold bets

1325
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:02,160
Speaker 11:  that have significant downside if they don't pay off. And so like

1326
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:06,120
Speaker 11:  Zuckerberg and Spiegel are, are really in, in pretty serious

1327
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:06,930
Speaker 11:  competition right now.

1328
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,770
Speaker 6:  Oh, was like, I keep just thinking about this, right. Silicon valley has

1329
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:14,700
Speaker 6:  been obsessed with AR VR for 10, 15 years. Now

1330
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:17,700
Speaker 6:  this has been like this big thing everybody's chasing it. They want to make

1331
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,600
Speaker 6:  it huge. These two companies have bet enormously on it, but the

1332
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,320
Speaker 6:  technology is still not actually there for the big gross adoption that they

1333
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:29,220
Speaker 6:  want. They're still like 10 years out. And Facebook can

1334
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:33,180
Speaker 6:  definitely like at least limp along. Even if things go bad, they

1335
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:36,720
Speaker 6:  can limp along to get there. Snap doesn't have that kind of

1336
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:40,560
Speaker 6:  runway like snaps in a much more precarious position. And so I'm

1337
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,040
Speaker 6:  like, that's it that's, that's your bet. Just like going in on

1338
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:47,910
Speaker 6:  snap, which is losing users as far as we know, and also

1339
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,870
Speaker 6:  AR which you've got at least minimum five

1340
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:55,590
Speaker 6:  years before there's any real like longterm success.

1341
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,230
Speaker 1:  Well here, here's just one way to think about the difference in scale there.

1342
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:01,770
Speaker 1:  Like we, we've done a bunch of reporting on what's going on inside of Metta

1343
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:05,520
Speaker 1:  and Facebook on this front too. And Mehta announced this big hiring

1344
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,850
Speaker 1:  slowdown and they had plans to hire 10,000

1345
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:13,240
Speaker 1:  developers this year. And we're pulling that back to six

1346
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,960
Speaker 1:  or 7,000 and that was framed. So the company is like a huge, huge, huge

1347
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,800
Speaker 1:  slowdown. But essentially what that means is Metta is going to hire

1348
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,490
Speaker 1:  a snap in the period of time. Snap is going to be

1349
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,300
Speaker 1:  lowering its staff by more than a thousand people. And both of those

1350
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:32,110
Speaker 1:  companies see that as like a gigantic slowdown in business and what's going

1351
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:36,100
Speaker 1:  on, like, it's, these two companies are playing like sort of the

1352
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:40,000
Speaker 1:  same game, but it's like, it's like one is like in the NFL. And the other

1353
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,960
Speaker 1:  is like my nephew's JV football team. Like

1354
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,740
Speaker 1:  it's, it's just wild to see how different these two things are. And,

1355
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:51,400
Speaker 1:  and now we're sort of at a point where like, until snap gets to this

1356
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:55,480
Speaker 1:  augmented reality future where it has, you know, this, this

1357
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,350
Speaker 1:  magical AR camera that it can sell to everybody. It's just a

1358
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:02,560
Speaker 1:  messaging app now. Like it, it is systematically getting rid of everything

1359
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,520
Speaker 1:  else that looks like money to snap it's except for the messaging app.

1360
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,570
Speaker 1:  And so it it's it's, it almost feels like snap is,

1361
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:14,140
Speaker 1:  is like lowering the odds of it. Being able to get where it's

1362
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:18,100
Speaker 1:  going, as things go here. And obviously these are like external

1363
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:21,100
Speaker 1:  forces that are forcing snap to do this. This is not like Evan Spiegel. Didn't

1364
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:25,000
Speaker 1:  wake up one morning and be like, you're all fired. But it's

1365
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,930
Speaker 1:  like, I mean, you never know LA is a weird place to live, but

1366
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:32,620
Speaker 1:  it's like, it just seems like it, it just, it hurts

1367
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,580
Speaker 1:  much worse at snap what's happening right now than it seems to even at

1368
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:36,880
Speaker 1:  Metta.

1369
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:40,630
Speaker 11:  Yeah. I mean, I think, I think there's a lot of pain at, at both

1370
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:44,290
Speaker 11:  companies. You know, I think if there's a silver lining for Snapchat and

1371
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,410
Speaker 11:  all this it's that people still really like Snapchat, like particularly

1372
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:51,310
Speaker 11:  young people really like Snapchat and that counts for

1373
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:54,340
Speaker 11:  something, right? It's like people under 30 don't care about Facebook, they

1374
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:56,800
Speaker 11:  don't care what, you know, whether it Facebook's around or not. And you

1375
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,340
Speaker 11:  know, Facebook's bad reputation may actually prevent it from having

1376
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:03,430
Speaker 11:  success in this market. Even if they are able to, you know, figure out some

1377
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:06,460
Speaker 11:  of the hardware problems that they have to figure out. So there's still

1378
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:06,850
Speaker 11:  a path.

1379
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,810
Speaker 6:  The snap still like mainly teens. Cause the only people I know, like the

1380
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:14,740
Speaker 6:  teens I know are all on Tik TOK and the only people I know are 40 somethings

1381
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:17,140
Speaker 6:  in rural Texas that you Snapchat.

1382
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:19,870
Speaker 1:  Oh no. You're you're missing out. The teens are very much on Snapchat.

1383
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:23,680
Speaker 6:  It's them and his 40 year old farmers in rural Texas.

1384
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:24,400
Speaker 6:  That's all, one of them.

1385
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:28,420
Speaker 1:  My favorite things to do is go on long car trips with my two nephews

1386
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:32,200
Speaker 1:  who are 16 and 15 and just basically see what

1387
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,560
Speaker 1:  push notifications they get. And it's like sitting there with, with one of

1388
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:39,520
Speaker 1:  them in the passenger seat, it was like a Tik TOK notification, every eight

1389
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,760
Speaker 1:  seconds and a Snapchat notification, every eight seconds. I mean, it was

1390
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:45,820
Speaker 1:  unbelievable. I like made him show me his screen time and he picks up his

1391
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:49,780
Speaker 1:  phone to open a Snapchat notification like 300 times

1392
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:53,440
Speaker 1:  a day. Like it's, it's wild and cases. Exactly. Right? Like there's no

1393
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,830
Speaker 1:  money in my 15 year old nephew for Snapchat.

1394
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:01,090
Speaker 1:  But like people love snap in a way that they don't love anything that

1395
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,240
Speaker 1:  meetup makes with the possible exception of WhatsApp. But like,

1396
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:07,840
Speaker 6:  Could you show him all of your sweet slack notifications where you're like,

1397
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,190
Speaker 6:  I get notifications. I check the time too.

1398
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,830
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I was like, oh, I was like, oh, you want to, you want to send me an

1399
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:16,250
Speaker 1:  email? And he's like, what is that? Like, no, you're a hundred thousand years

1400
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:16,520
Speaker 1:  old

1401
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:17,690
Speaker 6:  When I tried to

1402
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:20,930
Speaker 1:  Text him and he was like, why are we texting? Like just take a picture and

1403
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:23,510
Speaker 1:  send it on Snapchat. Like, it's fine. I'm very old,

1404
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:25,310
Speaker 6:  Very old. We all are.

1405
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,290
Speaker 1:  All right. We should also talk about truth socials. Speaking of companies

1406
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,420
Speaker 1:  that seem to be falling apart,

1407
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,090
Speaker 6:  Alex, does it count as a company?

1408
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:39,080
Speaker 1:  I mean, yeah. I mean, that's fair. I guess if, if snap is like

1409
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:43,070
Speaker 1:  the JV football team truth, social seems like, like one

1410
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:46,910
Speaker 1:  guy in jeans, throwing a football in a park. It's like, is that

1411
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:47,510
Speaker 1:  anything?

1412
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:51,860
Speaker 6:  I think it's like, I, I am convinced true. Social is

1413
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:55,460
Speaker 6:  run off of like somebody's network attached

1414
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:59,450
Speaker 6:  storage. Like they bought at best buy and they plugged it in and

1415
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:03,230
Speaker 6:  they like, they, they, they booted up like their bootleg Twitter and they're

1416
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:07,130
Speaker 6:  like done. This is, this is our whole application we're here. And it's just

1417
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:10,970
Speaker 6:  like one guy, every time they have an outage it's because like Comcast is

1418
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:13,520
Speaker 6:  just having an outage in that one dude's area. And he's like, oh, I'm sorry,

1419
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,530
Speaker 6:  man. I keep I'm on the phone with him.

1420
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,920
Speaker 11:  I ever tell you guys about the time I got ratioed on. True. So now

1421
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,760
Speaker 1:  Are there enough people to ratio you?

1422
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:25,550
Speaker 11:  I, I post it. Oh yeah. Yeah. President Trump has a lot of

1423
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:29,330
Speaker 11:  fans famously. Yeah. I just posted

1424
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:32,240
Speaker 11:  vaccines are safe and effective. And I just got roasted to hell.

1425
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,560
Speaker 6:  Well, you know, the company is supposed to be doing, it was supposed to do

1426
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,070
Speaker 6:  a spec, right? It was, it was supposed to be acquired by another

1427
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:43,880
Speaker 6:  company. And that has been delayed because everybody is realized that

1428
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:47,840
Speaker 6:  SPACs are actually probably a terrible way to go public. And if you

1429
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,510
Speaker 6:  go public this way, you will lose lots of money and lose your investors.

1430
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:54,380
Speaker 6:  Lots of money. Don't do it. I mean, do it, you live your life. It's your

1431
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:58,250
Speaker 6:  money. It's not mine unless it's in my 401k, which please don't

1432
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:02,090
Speaker 6:  add any smacks to my 401k. But so they, they still had to do their

1433
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:05,960
Speaker 6:  sec filings. And that's where we saw that they've lost a lot

1434
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,320
Speaker 6:  of money this year, like six they've they've lost over

1435
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,980
Speaker 6:  $6 million and they've generated absolutely no

1436
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,870
Speaker 6:  revenue. This company has made no money.

1437
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:18,860
Speaker 1:  There's one way to read that where this is actually like a

1438
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:22,130
Speaker 1:  relatively fiscally responsible startup, like, oh, they've only lost

1439
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:25,790
Speaker 1:  $6 million this year. And they're, pre-revenue like, that's pretty

1440
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:28,730
Speaker 1:  good. That's like, that's how you get interest and Horowitz to like write

1441
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:31,220
Speaker 1:  you a check for $650 million most of the time.

1442
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:36,350
Speaker 1:  But it also seems like the, like every piece of what's going on at true

1443
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:39,860
Speaker 1:  social is just like collapsing. Like do they owe their

1444
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:42,530
Speaker 1:  hosting company over a million dollars? Apparently.

1445
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:46,640
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They, they stopped paying right forge, which is a conservative

1446
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,540
Speaker 6:  internet infrastructure company. They stopped paying them. And the guy

1447
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:54,410
Speaker 6:  who's like right forward CEO, Martin availa is like, well, we're gonna, we're

1448
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:57,020
Speaker 6:  going to keep servicing it. We're going to keep providing service even though

1449
01:19:57,050 --> 01:20:00,710
Speaker 6:  Mr. Trump's, company's not paying us any money, which is not a new thing

1450
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:04,700
Speaker 6:  for a Trump owned company. They are actually notorious for

1451
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:08,580
Speaker 6:  never paying their bills. So these people should not be shocked

1452
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:12,480
Speaker 6:  in any way, shape or form, but yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's not

1453
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,930
Speaker 6:  going well. And I think it was earlier last month where

1454
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:19,830
Speaker 6:  where's it based it's based in Sarasota, right? Like your social is based

1455
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:23,520
Speaker 6:  in Sarasota and the newspaper and Sarasota like went to the offices and was

1456
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,940
Speaker 6:  like, oh, nobody's been there in months. It's just like a ghost town office.

1457
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:31,050
Speaker 6:  It's incredible. It's just this huge house of

1458
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:34,740
Speaker 6:  cards. And you walk in and it doesn't collapse because they're

1459
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:38,700
Speaker 6:  very nice cards. And there's just that, that network attached storage at

1460
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:42,690
Speaker 6:  Synology somebody's unread just sitting in the middle of an office.

1461
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,340
Speaker 6:  I don't know if that's true, but that's what I

1462
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:44,940
Speaker 1:  Assume flex

1463
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:47,520
Speaker 6:  Server runs Plex.

1464
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,760
Speaker 1:  And also, I just want to say, first of all, that the fact that you just said

1465
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,820
Speaker 1:  the phrase, conservative internet infrastructure company, and we were all

1466
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:57,630
Speaker 1:  just like, that makes sense is like bananas. Like how is this the

1467
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,580
Speaker 1:  world that we live in? And yet

1468
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:03,900
Speaker 6:  That's a thing. There's a conservative phone company in

1469
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:07,080
Speaker 6:  Texas right now. That is like, we're a conservative phone company

1470
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:11,490
Speaker 6:  and we support America and one like, oh, okay.

1471
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,420
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I definitely care what my GPU's have to

1472
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:17,100
Speaker 1:  say about American politics.

1473
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:22,020
Speaker 6:  They're like funding a bunch of the big library races in Texas,

1474
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:25,200
Speaker 6:  where people are trying to pull books from the library. But, but yeah, there's

1475
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,860
Speaker 6:  a lot of these like little spin-off companies who are like, oh,

1476
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:32,250
Speaker 6:  you've made your, your political like

1477
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:36,510
Speaker 6:  choices, your identity. And you want to only ascribe to things that also

1478
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:39,600
Speaker 6:  associated with that identity. We will take your money. Will the service

1479
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,910
Speaker 6:  be good? Probably not.

1480
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:46,110
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I just, yeah, my GPU's voting for president is the

1481
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:49,410
Speaker 1:  thing. I really have a lot of thoughts about, but, but the other thing that's

1482
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:52,380
Speaker 1:  happening in the social is it, it keeps getting kicked off of app stores,

1483
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,370
Speaker 1:  right? Like, yes, he hasn't this become like, like content moderation is,

1484
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:59,670
Speaker 1:  is now like hilariously true social's biggest problem.

1485
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,790
Speaker 11:  Well, yeah, cause they, they can't even get their app on the Google play

1486
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:06,030
Speaker 11:  store, which is like, this might be one of the only cases I know about where,

1487
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:09,840
Speaker 11:  where apple is letting something onto the app store that Google is

1488
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:13,440
Speaker 11:  not letting on to its app store over reasons of content moderation.

1489
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:17,160
Speaker 11:  So Google has apparently said to them, your content moderation is a good

1490
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,730
Speaker 11:  enough. And true social came back and said, yes, it is. But so far

1491
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,930
Speaker 11:  that w we are where we are. I can of course still access to

1492
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:28,890
Speaker 11:  social on my iOS device. But our Android friends are out

1493
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:29,670
Speaker 11:  of luck. And that's that,

1494
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:33,510
Speaker 1:  What does true social do here? Like the content moderation thing. And true

1495
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:37,050
Speaker 1:  social has been a weird thing to follow over time, because like,

1496
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:40,740
Speaker 1:  in part, it launched based on the idea that everybody was moderating content

1497
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:43,020
Speaker 1:  and that that's a huge problem, but then they've started to moderate content

1498
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:46,170
Speaker 1:  because it turns out if you don't, your platform becomes a nightmare, hellscape

1499
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:49,740
Speaker 1:  that nobody actually wants to hang out on you're you're our true

1500
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:53,640
Speaker 1:  social influencer on the, on the podcast. What, what is true

1501
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,250
Speaker 1:  social doing? Have they landed somewhere? Do they have policies?

1502
01:22:56,910 --> 01:23:00,240
Speaker 11:  They say that they do. And you know, for what it's worth, these discussions

1503
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:04,020
Speaker 11:  are not really held out in the open. So I don't know what Google found

1504
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:07,870
Speaker 11:  or, or did not see in terms of moderation that made it feel like

1505
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:11,230
Speaker 11:  it didn't belong in the app store, but I'll say like usually has to be pretty

1506
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:14,350
Speaker 11:  serious, right? Like, cause these companies don't do not want to be in these

1507
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:16,990
Speaker 11:  fights. They don't like drawing attention to how much power they have over

1508
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:20,740
Speaker 11:  the entire internet economy. So my guess is that, that, that there is

1509
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:24,010
Speaker 11:  something happening there that, that really freaked out the Google people.

1510
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:28,420
Speaker 1:  I just, yeah, all of this is like, yeah, of course this is going on. I do

1511
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,940
Speaker 1:  wonder if there was a gating event like you're talking about, but it seems

1512
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:34,930
Speaker 1:  like this is the kind of thing that either of these platforms could

1513
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:38,260
Speaker 1:  have just picked any moment they felt like to just be like and know,

1514
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:42,400
Speaker 1:  and yeah, it just feels like truth. Social is at this moment of you

1515
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:46,090
Speaker 1:  now discover truth social. When you see somebody take a screenshot of a Trump

1516
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:49,300
Speaker 1:  post and post it on Twitter, like that is the entirety of my interaction

1517
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:53,380
Speaker 1:  with true social is Trump's screenshots tweeted by other

1518
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,710
Speaker 1:  people, which is like, I'm not sure what we're accomplishing here, but it

1519
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:58,360
Speaker 1:  it's, it, it doesn't feel great.

1520
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:03,010
Speaker 6:  I mean, it was like I do again, I know a lot of folks

1521
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:06,820
Speaker 6:  who are fairly conservative and in rural areas in truth, social was like

1522
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:10,420
Speaker 6:  a big deal for a second. There, like there was a really serious

1523
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:14,290
Speaker 6:  migration of these folks who were getting their news almost exclusively

1524
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:18,220
Speaker 6:  from like conservative memes on Facebook, which is

1525
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:21,940
Speaker 6:  unfortunately more people than it should be. They really think they

1526
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:25,330
Speaker 6:  believe in this thing. They think it's real. They think that like they're

1527
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:28,840
Speaker 6:  helping the country by being on truth, social, and they're

1528
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:32,770
Speaker 6:  helping their president. And there's, there's

1529
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:36,700
Speaker 6:  definitely some like, it's weird, man. It's just like a weird app to

1530
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:40,390
Speaker 6:  me. And it's weird that it tried to be a SPAC and it's

1531
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:44,020
Speaker 6:  weird that the SPAC is collapsing and it's weird that like the primary

1532
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:47,980
Speaker 6:  company is not making money and is losing money and is maybe not

1533
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:51,850
Speaker 6:  going to be able to buy it, which was all just kind of a big money laundering.

1534
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:55,330
Speaker 6:  Legal, let me be clear. SPACs are illegal money laundering

1535
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,140
Speaker 6:  scheme. Like this is all just extremely wild to me.

1536
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:03,280
Speaker 11:  I mean, it's certainly an eventful story and

1537
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:07,000
Speaker 11:  it's an eventful story. And yet, if you had asked me two years ago to predict

1538
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,930
Speaker 11:  some likely events in the history of true social, getting

1539
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:14,740
Speaker 11:  kicked off of an app store and going bankrupt would have probably been two

1540
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:16,030
Speaker 11:  of the main things that I predicted.

1541
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:20,410
Speaker 6:  It's not it's, you know, it's not close to being bankrupt yet. They've they've,

1542
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:24,400
Speaker 6:  they've declared no bankruptcy, right? Like that hasn't happened,

1543
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,690
Speaker 6:  but it certainly seems like it could, if somebody kicks over

1544
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:32,410
Speaker 6:  the, the little Synology server in their empty office,

1545
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:33,940
Speaker 6:  anything could happen. Don't do that.

1546
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:37,150
Speaker 1:  All right. If we've learned one thing today though, it's that if, if they

1547
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:40,810
Speaker 1:  just roll out editing truths, then it's all over.

1548
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:41,680
Speaker 1:  Everything's going to be fine.

1549
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:42,100
Speaker 6:  Be

1550
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,030
Speaker 11:  Great. I'm all in.

1551
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:48,580
Speaker 1:  There you go. All right. We have gone way over. Even without the light here.

1552
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:52,390
Speaker 1:  It's not on the Ally's fault, but it's mostly in the lies fault, but we should

1553
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:55,030
Speaker 1:  go a bunch of really good stuff on the verge of this week. Casey, you and

1554
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:58,510
Speaker 1:  Zoe had a really great piece, big scoop about Twitter. You want to give us

1555
01:25:58,510 --> 01:26:00,460
Speaker 1:  like the super quick rundown on that? Cause you're here.

1556
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:04,220
Speaker 11:  Yeah. So the story is that was planning to

1557
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:07,490
Speaker 11:  release an only fans competitor. They were going to let the adult creators

1558
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:10,850
Speaker 11:  on the platform, begin selling subscriptions to

1559
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:14,660
Speaker 11:  photos and videos that included sexually explicit content.

1560
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,830
Speaker 11:  But before they launched it, they conducted what they call a red team exercise,

1561
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:21,890
Speaker 11:  where they convened a bunch of people to try to poke holes in the plan and

1562
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:25,100
Speaker 11:  say, where could this go wrong? And the number one thing that came up was

1563
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:28,430
Speaker 11:  that Twitter does not currently have the tools in place necessary to

1564
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:31,940
Speaker 11:  adequately police, the amount of child sexual abuse material on the

1565
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:35,930
Speaker 11:  platform and the amount of nonconsensual nudity on the platform. So they

1566
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:38,780
Speaker 11:  identified some really serious problems. And then we paired that with another

1567
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:42,290
Speaker 11:  document that we obtained from last year, where researchers sounded the

1568
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:45,500
Speaker 11:  alarm about this and said, this is a real issue. We do not have the tools

1569
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,500
Speaker 11:  we need and leadership needs to invest. And our understanding is that for
