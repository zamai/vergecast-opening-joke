Description: Oh, you thought AI was just in your browser and on your phone? Well, the AI is coming from inside the house. The Verge's Jen Pattison Tuohy and Google's Anish Kattukaran both join the show to discuss last week's Google smart home news, including the company's big bet on the Gemini assistant. Anish explains why Google cares about the smart home in the first place, why things haven't exactly gone great so far, and why he's so convinced the new generation of AI can make it work. After that, The Verge's Vee Song joins the show to talk about Peloton's newest gear, including a $6,695 treadmill and a huge new push into personalized AI training features. Vee then sticks around to help David answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about how many smartwatches is too many smartwatches. Spoiler alert: the answer is two. But it's not quite as simple as that.

00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:05,925
Speaker 1:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of treadmills that

3
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:09,805
Speaker 1:  don't fit anywhere in my house. So I'm moving and we have this

4
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:13,605
Speaker 1:  new room in our new house that is basically, it's like a big

5
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:16,725
Speaker 1:  closet, but my wife looked at it and was like, oh, wouldn't it be cool if

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:20,245
Speaker 1:  we use that as like an exercise room? It's, it has no windows.

7
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:24,605
Speaker 1:  It's just like a seven foot by five foot cave. And

8
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:27,005
Speaker 1:  she's like, what if we put a treadmill in there? So we've been shopping for

9
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,965
Speaker 1:  treadmills and it turns out that treadmills are either horrible or

10
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:34,925
Speaker 1:  $7,000 and in many cases are both of those things. So if you

11
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:38,845
Speaker 1:  have an idea of a treadmill that isn't gigantic,

12
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:43,165
Speaker 1:  isn't horrible and isn't $7,000, please tell me

13
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:47,885
Speaker 1:  my family is dying. We need this. Thank you. Anyway, that is not what

14
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:50,405
Speaker 1:  we're here to talk about. Actually, we are here a little bit to talk about

15
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:52,965
Speaker 1:  treadmills, but we're gonna get to that later. We're gonna do two things

16
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:56,445
Speaker 1:  on The Vergecast today. First, we're gonna talk more about the smart Home.

17
00:00:56,525 --> 00:01:00,045
Speaker 1:  We talked a lot about Amazon and Alexa and Echo devices last week.

18
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,365
Speaker 1:  This week we're gonna dig in to what Google is really up

19
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:08,125
Speaker 1:  to. I think Google is maybe the company best set up

20
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:11,645
Speaker 1:  to figure out the smart home, but it's been trying as long as anybody and

21
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:15,205
Speaker 1:  hasn't really made any progress. So we're gonna talk to Anish Karran, who

22
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:19,085
Speaker 1:  runs a lot of that stuff at Google and try to figure out whether

23
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:22,965
Speaker 1:  Google or anybody is actually set up to do this well and do

24
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:26,925
Speaker 1:  it now. After that, we're gonna talk to V Song about what is going on with

25
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:30,285
Speaker 1:  Peloton, because Peloton, a company I hadn't thought about in a long time,

26
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:34,245
Speaker 1:  announced a bunch of really interesting and really expensive stuff

27
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:38,205
Speaker 1:  last week. So we're gonna get into what it all means and whether the

28
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:41,325
Speaker 1:  Peloton people are gonna be into it. We also have a really fun question on

29
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:44,645
Speaker 1:  the Vergecast Hotline that may or may not lead you to buy many more gadgets

30
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:47,525
Speaker 1:  and put them all over your body. All of that is coming up in just a second.

31
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:51,165
Speaker 1:  But first, I just found this treadmill that is $200. My wife sent me a link.

32
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:54,205
Speaker 1:  I'm confident it's horrible, but I have to go read reviews.

33
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:58,005
Speaker 1:  Please send help. This is The Vergecast, we'll be right back.

34
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:00,365
Speaker 2:  Rinse takes your

35
00:03:05,615 --> 00:03:08,885
Speaker 4:  State Farm help you create a competitive price when you choose to bundle

36
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,885
Speaker 4:  home and auto bundling. Just another way to save with a personal

37
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:16,645
Speaker 4:  price plan like a good neighbor State Farm is there. Prices are based on

38
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:20,125
Speaker 4:  rating plans that vary by state coverage. Options are selected by the customer.

39
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:23,965
Speaker 4:  Availability. Amount of discounts and savings and eligibility vary by state.

40
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:29,885
Speaker 1:  Alright, we're back. Jen Tui's here. Hi Jen.

41
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:31,565
Speaker 6:  Hi David. Long time noi,

42
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:35,365
Speaker 1:  I just can't stop talking to you about Smart Home. Thanks. You have a guest

43
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,445
Speaker 1:  for us today. You, you have, you've brought someone you think would be fun

44
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:41,565
Speaker 1:  for us to talk to. So just set this up for us a little bit before we get

45
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:43,365
Speaker 1:  into it. Who, who are we about to talk to?

46
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:47,645
Speaker 6:  Yes. So we have Anish Cran who is the head of

47
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:51,525
Speaker 6:  Google Home and Nest. And he is basically the guy that

48
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:54,965
Speaker 6:  has been leading the sort of resurgence,

49
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:59,605
Speaker 6:  should we put it that way, or of Google Home o Over the last few years

50
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:03,685
Speaker 6:  and last week there were a lot of announcements from Google Home about

51
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:06,525
Speaker 6:  completely rearchitecturing, the Google Home app,

52
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:11,125
Speaker 6:  new hardware, new software for Google Home, all of which

53
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:15,285
Speaker 6:  has been sort of developed under his leadership over the last few years.

54
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:18,885
Speaker 6:  So he's, and he's the guy that I've spoken to several times over the last

55
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:22,845
Speaker 6:  few years about this big shift that we're seeing from this command

56
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,485
Speaker 6:  and control infrastructure in our home to these LLMs coming,

57
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:29,965
Speaker 6:  you know, generative AI powered voice assistance that he

58
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:34,165
Speaker 6:  believes. And I, I guess I'm drinking the Kool-Aid

59
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:37,845
Speaker 6:  a little bit. It's gonna be a huge change for the smart home.

60
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:41,885
Speaker 6:  This is what Amazon's doing with Alexa plus. So yeah, he, I'm

61
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:45,605
Speaker 6:  hope hopeful he'll be able to give us some interesting insights into what's

62
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:49,325
Speaker 6:  going on, why it's been so difficult, why Google Home has been so

63
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:52,605
Speaker 6:  bad for so long and what's coming in the future.

64
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:57,085
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So on the Google Home being so bad for so long, I just like, I'm curious

65
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:59,565
Speaker 1:  if you And I are kind of coming into this interview in the same headspace,

66
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,965
Speaker 1:  because just to lay my own cards on the table, I would say the way I think

67
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:06,925
Speaker 1:  of Google's smart home efforts is that when we talk about sort of the

68
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:10,605
Speaker 1:  smart assistant 1.0 revolution, such as it was,

69
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:14,965
Speaker 1:  it was basically Alexa and Google Assistant. Yeah. Like Siri is kind of off

70
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:18,485
Speaker 1:  on the side doing its own thing, largely very badly. Yeah.

71
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:22,165
Speaker 1:  But Alexa and Google Assistant are largely trying to do the same thing the

72
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:25,645
Speaker 1:  same way. And I think my impression is that Google

73
00:05:25,645 --> 00:05:29,605
Speaker 1:  Assistant became a very good thing to do on your phone and that it seemed

74
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:33,005
Speaker 1:  like Google sort of forgot it, had a smart home project,

75
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:37,085
Speaker 1:  but I pay less attention to it than you do. So how, where's your head kind

76
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:38,045
Speaker 1:  of coming into this conversation?

77
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:41,565
Speaker 6:  So yeah, Google Home and Amazon Alexa have kind of grown up together in the

78
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:45,085
Speaker 6:  Smart home. It's been interesting to watch their different approaches.

79
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:49,165
Speaker 6:  They've, you know, kind of copied each other. They've been moving, you know,

80
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:53,045
Speaker 6:  at the same speed. But some, sometimes we'll get better features on one

81
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:56,805
Speaker 6:  than the other. And then all of a sudden, a few years ago, Google Home just

82
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:59,805
Speaker 6:  started to sort of seem to stop to innovate and everyone was like, well,

83
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:03,605
Speaker 6:  Google has checked out on the smart home, just like they've checked out

84
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:07,445
Speaker 6:  on previous projects and hardware in the past. Yep.

85
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,565
Speaker 6:  But I'd always, during this period, I've been talking to the team there and

86
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:15,205
Speaker 6:  it's, there's this sort of passionate small team that seems to be doing a

87
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:18,005
Speaker 6:  lot of really interesting things. And one of the core

88
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,495
Speaker 6:  differences here, I think for Google Home has been

89
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:26,815
Speaker 6:  the way it was built. And I think they've spent the last several

90
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:30,615
Speaker 6:  years fixing that because they brought together Nest.

91
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:33,695
Speaker 6:  And we've talked about Nest before, and Nest is a great smart home

92
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:38,735
Speaker 6:  hardware ecosystem and they brought it together with Google and its

93
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:42,695
Speaker 6:  software ecosystem and Chromecast. So basically they

94
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:46,135
Speaker 6:  built a smart home system on three separate pillars.

95
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:50,215
Speaker 6:  And it, you know, I think there have been, this was an interesting space

96
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:53,935
Speaker 6:  that everyone was trying to understand as they built it. And

97
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:58,055
Speaker 6:  now what they've done is rearchitect everything from the

98
00:06:58,055 --> 00:07:01,215
Speaker 6:  ground up. And that's what's they've been doing the last few years. And this

99
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:04,815
Speaker 6:  is why we've been seeing sort of not last few years, maybe last couple years,

100
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:08,095
Speaker 6:  we've been seeing this a bit of a degradation, which has been frustrating

101
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:11,815
Speaker 6:  users understandably. Because when you have a product that doesn't do what

102
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:15,615
Speaker 6:  you expected it to do anymore, you get very unhappy. But

103
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:19,775
Speaker 6:  I think I'm quite excited by what their show, what

104
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:23,575
Speaker 6:  they showed me last week, what they're working towards. Because I

105
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:26,615
Speaker 6:  do believe, And I think you agree with me here, that David, that Google

106
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:30,975
Speaker 6:  Home with the infrastructure that Google can provide

107
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:36,165
Speaker 6:  has one of is PO is positioned really well to

108
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:39,925
Speaker 6:  make the smart home work. So I'm excited to see

109
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:43,765
Speaker 6:  whether they can take this where they want to go, and most

110
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:47,405
Speaker 6:  importantly, whether Google slash Alphabet is gonna really continue

111
00:07:47,705 --> 00:07:50,885
Speaker 6:  to push and invest in this space. I mean, I think they're paying attention

112
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:54,165
Speaker 6:  to it now because Gemini, you know, that's everything.

113
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:58,085
Speaker 6:  That's all Google seems to care about right now. But I'm just hoping we can

114
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:01,605
Speaker 6:  keep the focus and attention here for a bit longer so that this team can

115
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:05,365
Speaker 6:  actually do something to make the smart home more exciting, more

116
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:08,045
Speaker 6:  useful, and more reliable.

117
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:12,605
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I like it. Alright, that's, that's good context. Let's just get

118
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:15,365
Speaker 1:  into it with Anish. Anish, Welcome to The Vergecast.

119
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:17,405
Speaker 7:  Thank you. I'm excited to be here.

120
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:20,365
Speaker 1:  Very glad to have you here. We have a lot to talk about. Jen has lots of

121
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:23,365
Speaker 1:  questions for you. I have lots of questions for you, but I think I wanna

122
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:27,205
Speaker 1:  start with the most like annoyingly philosophical question I can

123
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:31,085
Speaker 1:  think of to start with. Okay. Which is, why does

124
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:34,885
Speaker 1:  Google care about the smart home at all? I, I guess a, does

125
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:37,405
Speaker 1:  Google care about the smart home? Because there have been times in the last

126
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:41,005
Speaker 1:  decade, I have debated the answer to that question, but like

127
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:45,325
Speaker 1:  for a, for a company that is as, as big and broad and

128
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:49,045
Speaker 1:  into as many things as Google is, what's in the smart home for Google at

129
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:49,365
Speaker 1:  this point?

130
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:50,045
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

131
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:52,615
Speaker 7:  probably a fair question.

132
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:58,225
Speaker 7:  And I, you know, I I I think we've also been on a, on a journey. So at a

133
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:01,745
Speaker 7:  different points, I, I can see how we've had some sort of high highs and

134
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:05,225
Speaker 7:  some challenging, challenging lows. But like, listen, in

135
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:08,665
Speaker 7:  20 15, 20 16 when we rolled out the first assistant, for us,

136
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:13,225
Speaker 7:  getting into the smart home was a means for people to have this sort of fundamentally

137
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:16,825
Speaker 7:  new interaction with, with the way they access

138
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:20,705
Speaker 7:  information and, and sort of how they control things in their home. I

139
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:23,465
Speaker 7:  think that was sort of a step function change for us at the time.

140
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,785
Speaker 7:  And then while, you know, the subsequent years have been, have been challenging,

141
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:31,945
Speaker 7:  the vision for us has always been can we build a home that's

142
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:35,825
Speaker 7:  truly helpful and, and and proactive and kids have to take care of

143
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,305
Speaker 7:  the people inside of it. That, that mission has been unchanged. I think for

144
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:43,155
Speaker 7:  us, as we looked at what has made it complicated over

145
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:47,105
Speaker 7:  the last few years, like we haven't always sort of lived up

146
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:50,705
Speaker 7:  to like the, the, the, the delta between expectations And I and reality I

147
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:54,105
Speaker 7:  think has been, there's been a gap. And I was telling Jen last week when

148
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:57,825
Speaker 7:  we were chatting, but in, in a lot of ways the biggest limiting

149
00:09:58,185 --> 00:10:02,065
Speaker 7:  function was the last generation of, of AI and ml. And so for us now at

150
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:05,705
Speaker 7:  this inflection point with the Gemini as sort of this core asset,

151
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:09,705
Speaker 7:  we think we are best positioned to realize that initial vision of

152
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:13,905
Speaker 7:  ours and then Gemini is this like incredible, powerful sort of

153
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,705
Speaker 7:  technology that can help us do that. And so, so yeah. So I,

154
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:21,785
Speaker 7:  I I think for us, this is realizing our, our existing vision, but

155
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:25,345
Speaker 7:  with Gemini at its core. And, and that's gonna help us sort of have a, a,

156
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,665
Speaker 7:  a step function change and what we can do there.

157
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,945
Speaker 1:  But just, lemme lemme just poke at that strategy a little bit. 'cause I think

158
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:34,585
Speaker 1:  you, you said, you said two things that I, that are I think

159
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:37,465
Speaker 1:  different that actually get conflated a lot. And I, I wanna see if we can

160
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:39,905
Speaker 1:  separate them out a little bit. 'cause there's, on the one side, there's

161
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,425
Speaker 1:  the, we have this thing called Google Assistant. We want people to use it

162
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,665
Speaker 1:  as much as possible. In order to do that, one of the things we need is probably

163
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:49,145
Speaker 1:  something for them to yell at in their living room that isn't their phone,

164
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:52,985
Speaker 1:  right? So like, smart home is a means to an end and the end is, lots of people

165
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:55,985
Speaker 1:  use Google Assistant seems like a perfectly

166
00:10:57,025 --> 00:11:00,105
Speaker 1:  rational Google strategy, right? Like sure. What we want is people to use

167
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:03,705
Speaker 1:  Google. This is a speaker through which they will use Google. That I completely

168
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,545
Speaker 1:  get that the, the idea of like, oh, we need to help

169
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:11,395
Speaker 1:  people turn their lights on and off. Yeah. Doesn't necessarily have to

170
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:15,235
Speaker 1:  follow from that, But it seems like to some extent it did that you're like,

171
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:18,035
Speaker 1:  okay, well we, well now we have this thing in people's living rooms, what

172
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:21,995
Speaker 1:  can we do with it? Like, is that, are those two different things? Am I,

173
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:24,635
Speaker 1:  am I wrong in parceling those two things out?

174
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:28,615
Speaker 7:  I think they're related, right? Like, I, I, in my mind it's, that's almost

175
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:31,695
Speaker 7:  sort of like a slightly internal way of looking at it. Okay. Like if you're,

176
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:35,535
Speaker 7:  if you take a, if you sort of take a consumer or a user lens, if you're talking

177
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:39,295
Speaker 7:  to this thing, let, let's call it, if you're talking to something in your

178
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:42,415
Speaker 7:  home, there's, there's a question that we ask often, which is like, what

179
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:46,375
Speaker 7:  are our expectations of what they can do with that? And I think in that

180
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,495
Speaker 7:  mental model, users expect to be able to have

181
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:54,365
Speaker 7:  at least sort of a, a partner where they can get access to information, which

182
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:57,205
Speaker 7:  is sort of the first thing you talked about. But they also wanna be able

183
00:11:57,205 --> 00:12:00,525
Speaker 7:  to take a lot of sort of like fundamental actions, right? Things that can

184
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:04,285
Speaker 7:  actually help, like, I've got three kids, things that can help me make my

185
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:07,085
Speaker 7:  life a little bit easier so that I can go back to spending time with the

186
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:10,965
Speaker 7:  kids, to me is incredibly powerful. And I think a lot of people, people

187
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:14,645
Speaker 7:  say that, So if you can make it a little bit easier to, you know, do stuff

188
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:18,605
Speaker 7:  in the home, like listening to your media, consuming your media, things like

189
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:22,325
Speaker 7:  household coordination, like setting timers, getting recipes, like,

190
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:26,445
Speaker 7:  you know, adding to lists, coordinating your, you know, your groceries and

191
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:29,965
Speaker 7:  maybe in the future, sort of ordering them, having them show up at your door

192
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:33,925
Speaker 7:  and then like all the smartphone controls. I think those are all sort of

193
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:37,845
Speaker 7:  like things that are related if you put it through the lens of what do

194
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:41,565
Speaker 7:  users expect when they're having this sort of conversation with Google

195
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:44,565
Speaker 7:  and or Gemini in the home. And so maybe that that's the way that I would,

196
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:48,525
Speaker 7:  I would sort of reframe what you asked. Yeah. Okay.

197
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:52,655
Speaker 6:  I I think one of the reasons that the, perhaps,

198
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:56,015
Speaker 6:  you know, the, a reason behind these questions are that

199
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:59,455
Speaker 6:  Google as a company has sort of had a history of, of

200
00:13:00,075 --> 00:13:03,855
Speaker 6:  paying attention to things and then not paying attention to things and where,

201
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:07,295
Speaker 6:  but you know, the smart home has been part of Google for, as you say, over

202
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:10,935
Speaker 6:  a decade, But it has gone through, as you mentioned, some peaks and troughs.

203
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:15,855
Speaker 6:  And so I, one of the things, and I've heard from my readers,

204
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:19,215
Speaker 6:  And I think you've heard from your users, is a fear that

205
00:13:19,535 --> 00:13:23,445
Speaker 6:  Google's just going to say, ah, we're done with the smart home.

206
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:27,045
Speaker 6:  You know, especially with the shift away from the Nest hardware,

207
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:31,845
Speaker 6:  the, the Nest protect, the Nest secure security system,

208
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:36,965
Speaker 6:  the Nest Yale door lock, you know, you, you sort of moved

209
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:40,525
Speaker 6:  those to, to new partners and there was, and over the last few

210
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:44,485
Speaker 6:  months and years, it felt like maybe to some

211
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:48,165
Speaker 6:  users, the smart home wasn't a priority. So I guess one of the things that

212
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:51,885
Speaker 6:  would be interesting to sort of understand from Google's perspective is

213
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:55,975
Speaker 6:  what is that value to the company? And

214
00:13:56,245 --> 00:14:00,215
Speaker 6:  that we can see and understand so that we think, okay, I don't

215
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:03,255
Speaker 6:  worry that they're just gonna pull the rug out from under me.

216
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:07,455
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Listen, I, I, I think it's a probably fair

217
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,975
Speaker 7:  criticism for what it's worth. I have read all of those comments

218
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:15,415
Speaker 7:  in your, in your comment threads. I, I spent a lot of time on Reddit in our

219
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:17,775
Speaker 7:  communities, reading all that stuff. And I have a, I have a deep empathy

220
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,975
Speaker 7:  for this. Like, I, I started building out my ecosystem well before I was

221
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:24,855
Speaker 7:  here in this role. Like, I've got, you know, Jen, we talk about this often.

222
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:28,535
Speaker 7:  I've got like 150, 200 devices in my home that I accrued,

223
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:32,775
Speaker 7:  you know, well before that. But yeah, so maybe going back to your question

224
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:36,535
Speaker 7:  around should people or should our users sort of trust our

225
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:37,735
Speaker 7:  commitment and our focus?

226
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:43,375
Speaker 7:  And that's, is that a fair summary of of what you're Yes. You're,

227
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:47,255
Speaker 7:  you're asking me. Okay. The thing that I would say to

228
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:51,245
Speaker 7:  that is our, and, and this is what we talk about internally as well,

229
00:14:51,795 --> 00:14:55,765
Speaker 7:  like our mission has not changed once over

230
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:59,685
Speaker 7:  the last decade. I think what people feel sometimes is how we

231
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:03,645
Speaker 7:  have tried to realize that has evolved, right? Yeah. So

232
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:06,925
Speaker 7:  when we start, like when we started over a decade ago and sort of like the

233
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:10,885
Speaker 7:  nascent phase of smart home, not all of your devices

234
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:14,205
Speaker 7:  were connected, right? There weren't a ton of smart home

235
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:18,845
Speaker 7:  OEMs making every device under the sun. And so yeah, there was an initial

236
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,765
Speaker 7:  hypothesis that, yeah, you know, we'll go and build every device in every

237
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,365
Speaker 7:  category at every price point. And you have this sort of like, price ladder

238
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:30,165
Speaker 7:  and people can choose everything. And I think what we saw over

239
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:34,005
Speaker 7:  time was that a, a few different things, but people just,

240
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:37,845
Speaker 7:  you know, there was a sort of massive explosion. You had a whole bunch of,

241
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:42,005
Speaker 7:  of OEMs and manufacturers come into the ecosystem. Suddenly everything was

242
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:45,965
Speaker 7:  quote unquote connected or smart. And then we had to sort of

243
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:49,485
Speaker 7:  look at, are we actually going to build every device in the home? Like, am

244
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:53,325
Speaker 7:  I going to go and build like vacuum cleaners and robo

245
00:15:53,355 --> 00:15:57,245
Speaker 7:  vacuums and blinds and washers and dryers and

246
00:15:57,245 --> 00:16:01,165
Speaker 7:  stuff like that? Because the reality was, users were very clear, they wanted

247
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:05,085
Speaker 7:  a lot of those devices and they didn't necessarily tell

248
00:16:05,085 --> 00:16:08,965
Speaker 7:  us that they wanted all of it from one partner or one

249
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:12,245
Speaker 7:  brand. Yeah. It was very clear from the early days of, of assistant, they

250
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:15,045
Speaker 7:  were like, Hey, I wanna be able to connect to everything, right? I wanna

251
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:17,645
Speaker 7:  connect to all of sort of the partners in the ecosystem. So we did have to

252
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:21,165
Speaker 7:  like, take a step back and say, where do we lean into our

253
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:25,325
Speaker 7:  strengths? And, and sort of like, how do we evolve our hardware

254
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:29,205
Speaker 7:  strategy as a function of that? And it has evolved. Like you'll, you know,

255
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:33,125
Speaker 7:  I I, when I was sharing with you last week was the way that I think

256
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,725
Speaker 7:  about our hardware strategy is that we will conti, we, we love

257
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:41,005
Speaker 7:  building hardware. We will continue to build awesome hardware. We think of

258
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:44,725
Speaker 7:  it as a two-pronged strategy. We're gonna build sort of

259
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:48,085
Speaker 7:  flagship devices in a few categories where we can showcase innovation,

260
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:51,965
Speaker 7:  where we can sort of push the boundaries of what Gemini can do, and then

261
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:55,885
Speaker 7:  we'll compliment that with partners that can sort of expand choice

262
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:59,285
Speaker 7:  for users, give you choice of form factor and price points and stuff like

263
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:02,365
Speaker 7:  that. And you saw a little bit of that, you know, this week, certainly in

264
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:05,885
Speaker 7:  cameras and doorbells, we announced Walmart and stuff like that. So there's

265
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:09,045
Speaker 7:  gonna be a lot more of that. But that's how I think about how our hardware

266
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:12,685
Speaker 7:  strategies evolved. But our broader mission remains like pretty

267
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:13,805
Speaker 7:  unchanged. Is

268
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:17,325
Speaker 1:  It obvious to you where that line is now in, in the sort of what is and isn't

269
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:18,525
Speaker 1:  your job in the smart home?

270
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:23,645
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I think so. And maybe just

271
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:27,325
Speaker 7:  to, to sort of put a finer point on the last

272
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:30,605
Speaker 7:  question of people trusting us. We've made some hard calls for sure,

273
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:35,725
Speaker 7:  but we've also, we've also sort of done a lot of hard work. Like

274
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:39,325
Speaker 7:  you think about two things that have happened this week. We said

275
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:43,285
Speaker 7:  we're gonna replace the Google assistant on every speaker

276
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:47,695
Speaker 7:  and smart display that we've built in a decade. There was an easier path

277
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:51,485
Speaker 7:  for us, by the way, which is to say just the new ones, right?

278
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:54,765
Speaker 7:  Sure. But not for a second did we say that we were gonna take that path?

279
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:58,805
Speaker 7:  Like for us, obviously like that, that was a, that that is like one sign

280
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:02,365
Speaker 7:  of commitment to our ecosystem. I think the other way, the other one that

281
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:06,205
Speaker 7:  I would point to is on the devices in the Nest app, right? We finally

282
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:10,525
Speaker 7:  finished this, this migration and we've said like, Hey, now all those

283
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,445
Speaker 7:  old Nest devices, some as old as like, you know, over a decade old, you can

284
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:18,405
Speaker 7:  use all of those in the Google Home app. Like also not an easy

285
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:21,285
Speaker 7:  undertaking. I know most people don't care about the, the behind the scenes,

286
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:25,325
Speaker 7:  but between those two things, those were like millions of lines of

287
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:29,325
Speaker 7:  code that we rewrote to support devices a

288
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:33,045
Speaker 7:  decade old. And for me, that's a sign of commitment Yeah. Where we could

289
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,845
Speaker 7:  have taken that easier path. So maybe that's the, that's a perfect question,

290
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:38,005
Speaker 7:  but David, sorry, you, you were asking a follow on.

291
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:42,285
Speaker 1:  Yeah. How would you describe sort of where your job begins and ends as

292
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:46,055
Speaker 1:  Google? Because like, I, I think the,

293
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:49,775
Speaker 1:  everybody in this industry has at various times tried to do the, actually

294
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:53,735
Speaker 1:  yes, we're going to become a washing machine manufacturer strategy, and

295
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:57,975
Speaker 1:  most companies, including Manu washing machine manufacturers, have realized

296
00:18:57,975 --> 00:19:01,775
Speaker 1:  that's the wrong strategy. So like, how, how do you paint the sort of

297
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,695
Speaker 1:  clear lines about like, this is actually not what we do in this space?

298
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,565
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I, I, I think we play a couple different roles

299
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:13,885
Speaker 7:  in this space. So I think one key place that

300
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:17,645
Speaker 7:  we play is, you know, we think it's really critical to build a

301
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:21,805
Speaker 7:  platform layer to enable partners to sort of innovate. We're

302
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:25,725
Speaker 7:  deeply committed. You know, I, Jen And I talk often about matter. We're

303
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:29,285
Speaker 7:  very committed to that as sort of an open standard as one of the early

304
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:33,565
Speaker 7:  supporters. And we have to, like matter's, got a way to go and

305
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:36,005
Speaker 7:  we'll sort of spend time there and we'll, we'll continue to invest. It's

306
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:39,325
Speaker 7:  not sort of a, something that's done in, in a week or a month or a year.

307
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:43,485
Speaker 7:  But yeah, so we think that platform layer is really, really important. So

308
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:48,445
Speaker 7:  what you saw with the sort of Walmart on camera announcement, we spent a

309
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:52,285
Speaker 7:  lot of time building software tools, right? Like SDKs, APIs,

310
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:56,245
Speaker 7:  things like that, where you could have a partner like Walmart whose core

311
00:19:56,245 --> 00:20:00,165
Speaker 7:  competencies building hardware in this contech in

312
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,725
Speaker 7:  this context, there's a lot of partners there that, that don't wanna build

313
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:06,605
Speaker 7:  the software layers, the intelligence layers. And so we think that

314
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,165
Speaker 7:  that's a, that's an important role. And the, the user ultimately is the net

315
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:14,005
Speaker 7:  beneficiary of it, right? You get devices at a whole bunch of different price

316
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:17,765
Speaker 7:  points. Other partners will do stuff that I don't think

317
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:21,565
Speaker 7:  necessarily is in Google's best interest to do. Like, you know, if you

318
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:25,405
Speaker 7:  want a pee hole camera or a bird bath camera and stuff like that. Like,

319
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:29,005
Speaker 7:  I think there's a bit, there's a markets for all these things I like, it's

320
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:31,245
Speaker 7:  just, I don't think it's, we are well positioned to do that, but if I can

321
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:34,685
Speaker 7:  give you the tools to do that, I definitely want to. And Gemini, I think

322
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:38,085
Speaker 7:  can be sort of a massive unlock in that capacity. So, so one role I think

323
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:41,445
Speaker 7:  we play is can we help support the ecosystem in that context by giving you

324
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:44,845
Speaker 7:  tools. I think the second layer is this, this

325
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:48,445
Speaker 7:  intelligence layer. Like this is, you know, for us, Gemini for home we think

326
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:52,125
Speaker 7:  is gonna be a big unlock. And so that's a major investment.

327
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:56,245
Speaker 7:  Gemini as a whole is, is a major investment for, for Google. And so I think

328
00:20:56,245 --> 00:21:00,045
Speaker 7:  there, there will play a, a massive role and to showcase that

329
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:03,725
Speaker 7:  second part, we'll build devices where it makes sense. That's why we're doing

330
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:07,565
Speaker 7:  cameras and doorbells because we think, you know, multimodal

331
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:11,485
Speaker 7:  semantic scene understanding type stuff is pretty unique. We think we can

332
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:15,645
Speaker 7:  showcase what the market can do. You know, speakers, smart

333
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:19,485
Speaker 7:  displays like hub, hub devices, those are other areas where

334
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:23,445
Speaker 7:  we think, you know, we should invest to showcase the market. Will we

335
00:21:23,445 --> 00:21:27,285
Speaker 7:  build it at every price point, every screen size, et cetera? No, probably

336
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:31,005
Speaker 7:  not. But again, similarly you'll see that us plus partner

337
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:32,365
Speaker 7:  approach there.

338
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:36,045
Speaker 6:  Before we move on to what you announced and what you're doing going forward,

339
00:21:36,485 --> 00:21:38,685
Speaker 6:  I just wanna address what we were talking about, a little bit about the kind

340
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:42,085
Speaker 6:  of frustration that maybe some Google Home and Nest users had had over the

341
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:45,645
Speaker 6:  past. And one of the things we talked about when we spoke last week was that

342
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:49,445
Speaker 6:  you basically had to rebuild Google Home with this launch, right? You

343
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:53,365
Speaker 6:  said there had been a number of different infrastructures

344
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:57,205
Speaker 6:  under there. You had Nest, you had Chromecast, you had a number of

345
00:21:57,565 --> 00:22:01,165
Speaker 6:  pieces and parts that you kind of had to pull together. And I know that

346
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:05,445
Speaker 6:  some of the problems specifically in the last few months, I

347
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:08,845
Speaker 6:  think a lot of users have been talking about things not working anymore with

348
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:12,165
Speaker 6:  Google Assistant features that had been taken away from Google Assistant

349
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,365
Speaker 6:  that we've reported on over the last year or so. And there was this sort

350
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:18,725
Speaker 6:  of feeling of like it was dropping off a cliff, but you're sort of saying

351
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:22,605
Speaker 6:  we've, we've caught it and we are bringing it back up. But I guess I would

352
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:26,285
Speaker 6:  just love to for you to explain a little bit about what's happened and

353
00:22:26,285 --> 00:22:30,165
Speaker 6:  what's, what happened in to the existing infrastructure of Google

354
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:33,925
Speaker 6:  Home and now what, what you've built that in that hopefully

355
00:22:33,925 --> 00:22:35,965
Speaker 6:  will be a more solid foundation to go forward.

356
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:39,515
Speaker 7:  Yeah, you're right, right. But

357
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:45,295
Speaker 7:  yeah, we've taken on a lot of different infrastructures over time and,

358
00:22:45,295 --> 00:22:47,495
Speaker 7:  and techno tech companies often, often do that,

359
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:52,935
Speaker 7:  though. There was sort of definitely an inflection point or sort of a moment

360
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,695
Speaker 7:  in time where we had to look at, I'm, I'm gonna sort of focus on the assistant

361
00:22:56,695 --> 00:22:59,855
Speaker 7:  piece for a quick second, where we had to say,

362
00:23:00,565 --> 00:23:04,215
Speaker 7:  okay, we, we see the limitations of

363
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:08,135
Speaker 7:  the last generation of AI and ml. And as we sort of did that

364
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:11,775
Speaker 7:  audit, it became very, very clear that we could put a bunch of

365
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:14,815
Speaker 7:  band-aids on that old technology and it would be pretty brittle

366
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:19,295
Speaker 7:  and probably not take us into the future. So then we had to make this hard

367
00:23:19,295 --> 00:23:21,855
Speaker 7:  call of like, okay, well listen, like we've gotta go over to this mo more

368
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:25,175
Speaker 7:  modern infrastructure and more modern architecture. That's, that was the

369
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:28,615
Speaker 7:  call to move to, to Gemini. But even that wasn't a silver bullet,

370
00:23:28,805 --> 00:23:32,695
Speaker 7:  because if you do that, you get all the stuff that LLMs do

371
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:36,375
Speaker 7:  really, really well, that creativity, sort of the conversationality,

372
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:41,495
Speaker 7:  but as an industry, LLMs weren't built to solve

373
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:45,175
Speaker 7:  like the predictable action type problem, right?

374
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:49,245
Speaker 7:  And so that's why we had to take some time to say, okay, we have to re-architect

375
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:53,165
Speaker 7:  Google Home for this world, which with both LLMs, but then also when I

376
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,165
Speaker 7:  say turn off my lights, it does it 10 time outta 10. So, so we had to do

377
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:59,525
Speaker 7:  that. Like that was a big, big undertaking. Now we feel like we're in a better

378
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:02,205
Speaker 7:  place. We'll start off, like I said, with early access,

379
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:06,965
Speaker 7:  there'll be learning, right? So it, it won't be perfect on, on

380
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:10,565
Speaker 7:  day one, but, but that's, that's, that is what we, we had to do there. And

381
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:13,405
Speaker 7:  it was a tough call because it meant for the users that had the assistant.

382
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:17,085
Speaker 7:  Things work great for a while and it will take them some time to get to a

383
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:20,045
Speaker 7:  better place. But that's where we wanted to compliment it with, okay, listen,

384
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:24,215
Speaker 7:  if you had our devices for a decade, I,

385
00:24:24,535 --> 00:24:28,495
Speaker 7:  I, I feel deep empathy for, for sort of the, the challenges because I was

386
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:32,215
Speaker 7:  one of those users. I still am, but I promise like the solution is coming

387
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:34,895
Speaker 7:  to you as well. It's not gonna require you to buy a new thing.

388
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:38,175
Speaker 6:  Right? And that's all starting to roll out this month. Is that right? Yeah.

389
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:41,935
Speaker 6:  So when are people gonna be seen, because I know this whole thing with the

390
00:24:41,935 --> 00:24:45,455
Speaker 6:  early access. Yes. I mean, Amazon's been doing this. It's like, yes,

391
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:49,735
Speaker 6:  some people can get it. So when can people who've been having problems

392
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:53,615
Speaker 6:  with Google Assistant feel comfort, you know, when, when are they

393
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:57,575
Speaker 6:  gonna see improvements with Gemini and is it gonna be improvement or is there

394
00:24:57,575 --> 00:25:01,455
Speaker 6:  still issues there? Because I know I've seen this with Alexa plus

395
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:06,095
Speaker 6:  that disconnect between what the LLM can do and what the, the

396
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:10,615
Speaker 6:  deterministic systems that we had before are able to do is still there.

397
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:13,375
Speaker 6:  Have you solved that problem? That's two questions. I know.

398
00:25:14,325 --> 00:25:17,815
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I think a lot of questions about this since we rolled out.

399
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:21,935
Speaker 7:  Yes. Early access is starting this month, I'll be super clear on our

400
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:26,255
Speaker 7:  Gemini for home is the thing that's going into early access for cameras

401
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:30,335
Speaker 7:  and doorbells that has already started to ramp up. So people who

402
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:33,535
Speaker 7:  have, have raised their hands to get into the early access should be

403
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,615
Speaker 6:  Seen. Just got one of them today. I am very excited. Hey,

404
00:25:35,615 --> 00:25:35,935
Speaker 7:  There you go.

405
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:39,775
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And the beautiful red one too, I'm holding up then the new camera,

406
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:42,535
Speaker 6:  it just arrived today, the very pretty red angle camera.

407
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:47,095
Speaker 7:  It very is what we call it. Yeah. So, so for early access for cameras

408
00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:51,015
Speaker 7:  and doorbells in the home app that's already started to roll out and, and

409
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:54,415
Speaker 7:  it is a rollout, so you know, it's not day and date for everyone.

410
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:59,335
Speaker 7:  So, and then on speakers and displays, we'll start ramping that up in the

411
00:25:59,335 --> 00:26:02,535
Speaker 7:  last week of, of this month. Okay. So yeah,

412
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:06,215
Speaker 6:  So like next month for the speakers and displays

413
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:07,095
Speaker 6:  for most people

414
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:11,055
Speaker 7:  Last week of this month, so, okay, sure. Yeah. I mean, yeah.

415
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:11,695
Speaker 7:  So Google

416
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,335
Speaker 6:  Assistant is gone. RIP it's dead. Yeah. When you get

417
00:26:15,395 --> 00:26:18,655
Speaker 6:  Gemini, can you, can you bring back Google Assistant if you don't like Gemini?

418
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:20,335
Speaker 6:  Or are you just, it's just Gemini?

419
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:23,775
Speaker 7:  No, it is, it's just, it's just Gemini. Yeah. So you'll get

420
00:26:24,795 --> 00:26:28,615
Speaker 7:  in the home app when you are sort of get off the early access

421
00:26:28,645 --> 00:26:32,335
Speaker 7:  list, you'll get a, a notification in there, you know, you'll go through

422
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:35,415
Speaker 7:  a couple screens, you know, to select your voices and do a bunch of things.

423
00:26:35,415 --> 00:26:39,255
Speaker 7:  But yeah, when you do that, you switch over from the assistant tona.

424
00:26:39,255 --> 00:26:42,895
Speaker 7:  So when you say, Hey, G, and I'm saying that so I don't trigger everybody's

425
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:46,885
Speaker 7:  speakers, all your listeners, but yeah, when you say, Hey G, you are at that

426
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:50,685
Speaker 7:  point, you are now talking to Gemini and that

427
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:52,165
Speaker 7:  that is not a reversible change,

428
00:26:52,475 --> 00:26:55,205
Speaker 6:  Will it be able to do everything that Google assistant can do today?

429
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:59,515
Speaker 7:  And, and, and hopefully more and more so, so yes. Yeah, yeah,

430
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:03,915
Speaker 7:  yeah. The, the intent is very much, yeah, whatever you've got with the assistant.

431
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:07,795
Speaker 7:  So all of your media stuff, everything you do with household coordination,

432
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:11,475
Speaker 7:  you know, people care about setting their timers and, and their lists

433
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:15,075
Speaker 7:  and all of those things. Yes. You, you'll absolutely be able to do that.

434
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:18,955
Speaker 7:  All of your smart home controls. Then I think the, the, the big thing though

435
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:22,875
Speaker 7:  is that with Gemini, it sort of unlocks this

436
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:26,515
Speaker 7:  more natural conversation, right? Yeah. And so we, Jen, we, we often talk

437
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:30,115
Speaker 7:  about how controlling the smart home has become like this, I have to speak

438
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:33,915
Speaker 7:  in a very specific syntax, right? Like, if I say the words in this

439
00:27:33,915 --> 00:27:37,875
Speaker 7:  exact order, then something will happen. So that's where I think

440
00:27:37,895 --> 00:27:40,875
Speaker 7:  Gemini will be the upgrade here is it's gonna be far more conversational.

441
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:44,075
Speaker 7:  You're not, you don't have to like remember the formulas to, to get it right.

442
00:27:44,215 --> 00:27:45,555
Speaker 7:  So pretty excited about that.

443
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:49,595
Speaker 6:  Well, and you talked about the cameras as being key there with the multimodality.

444
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:54,355
Speaker 6:  Not everyone wants cameras in their homes, but people want smart homes and

445
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:58,275
Speaker 6:  there's so many more parts and pieces to creating

446
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:02,435
Speaker 6:  a, a more a home that understands what you do than just

447
00:28:02,655 --> 00:28:06,515
Speaker 6:  visual. So I guess can you speak a little bit to how you've, what

448
00:28:06,515 --> 00:28:10,195
Speaker 6:  your vision is for how that, that ambient home kind of all comes together

449
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:13,275
Speaker 6:  outside of just the cameras? Because obviously the cameras are what you launched

450
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:16,195
Speaker 6:  last week, but I wanna know more about the future.

451
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:20,755
Speaker 7:  Yeah, and, And I, in, in some ways I, I think

452
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:21,435
Speaker 7:  we've taken,

453
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:26,865
Speaker 7:  as an industry, we've taken this view that a, a camera is sort of a predominantly

454
00:28:27,985 --> 00:28:31,465
Speaker 7:  security device, right? Like you put cameras to like, that's, that's probably

455
00:28:31,465 --> 00:28:33,905
Speaker 7:  the primary thing that people use it for.

456
00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:37,625
Speaker 7:  One way that I think about it is that

457
00:28:39,365 --> 00:28:43,105
Speaker 7:  the camera in so many ways will become kind of this

458
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,425
Speaker 7:  general purpose sensor in a way, right? Right.

459
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:51,305
Speaker 7:  Whereas, you know, today you've got like motion sensors and they do a very

460
00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:54,665
Speaker 7:  specific thing. You've got water leak sensors and do do a specific thing

461
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:57,865
Speaker 7:  and, and you've got all these different sensors, right? And those I think

462
00:28:57,865 --> 00:29:01,625
Speaker 7:  all have a, have a tremendous role. But I think the role of a camera evolves

463
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,945
Speaker 7:  from just like, you know, I see a thing, I tell you the thing, and it's

464
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:08,865
Speaker 7:  predominantly security to, it could be this incredibly powerful like

465
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:12,865
Speaker 7:  general purpose sensor. Yeah. That sort of makes the, the

466
00:29:12,865 --> 00:29:16,665
Speaker 7:  home smarter. Now, of course there, there's like different layers

467
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:20,585
Speaker 7:  of comfort that have to come with that for, for people to adopt it in different

468
00:29:20,585 --> 00:29:24,265
Speaker 7:  contexts, right? Like, you're probably reasonably comfortable with it outdoors

469
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:27,665
Speaker 7:  in your backyard and your front yard to bring something inside the house.

470
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:31,505
Speaker 7:  You've gotta do it in a way that you trust it and you feel like it's

471
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:35,265
Speaker 7:  secure and, and stuff like that. So, And I think there the biggest

472
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:38,665
Speaker 7:  unlock will be if users start to see that there's value that it's giving

473
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:42,565
Speaker 7:  them, then, then they might be willing to make that, that

474
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:46,005
Speaker 7:  trade. Yeah. But so, so that's my sort of view on, on cameras.

475
00:29:46,765 --> 00:29:50,725
Speaker 7:  I think the, the notion of Gemini being this proactive, like helper in

476
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:54,565
Speaker 7:  the home absolutely has to encompass all of the devices in your smart

477
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:58,085
Speaker 7:  home. And, And I think this is like the, this has been in my mind that the

478
00:29:58,085 --> 00:30:01,005
Speaker 7:  gap in the smart home has been, and you, we've talked about this before,

479
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:05,665
Speaker 7:  the journey has never, the promise has been if you invest in a smart home

480
00:30:05,665 --> 00:30:07,705
Speaker 7:  and you add more devices in the home gets smarter,

481
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:08,585
Speaker 6:  Right?

482
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:12,265
Speaker 7:  That is not the case today, right? Yeah. Every device, every incremental

483
00:30:12,265 --> 00:30:16,025
Speaker 7:  device I add to my home, it gets an order of magnitude worse.

484
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:19,905
Speaker 7:  It's more set up, they don't work together. Automations

485
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:23,665
Speaker 7:  is like this thing I've gotta do if this, then that. And like, it's, it's

486
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:27,585
Speaker 7:  so complex. And so this is where, for me, it's not about

487
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:31,505
Speaker 7:  automations, but it's about Gemini. Just being able to say, okay, bring all

488
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:34,345
Speaker 7:  of your devices in, we'll figure it out for you. That to me is the unlock.

489
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:38,225
Speaker 7:  And it has to, at its core be bring in any device, right?

490
00:30:38,325 --> 00:30:42,265
Speaker 7:  Any sensor, any compatible, like smart home device and can I figure it out

491
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:43,345
Speaker 7:  and can I make it smarter?

492
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:47,065
Speaker 6:  So we haven't had a new Nest hub smart display for a while. Yeah.

493
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:51,185
Speaker 6:  There was the Google Pixel tablet, which wasn't really, but kind of, and

494
00:30:51,205 --> 00:30:51,665
Speaker 6:  ev yeah.

495
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:57,105
Speaker 6:  So, and there was, you know, this, you've talked a lot about

496
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,905
Speaker 6:  cameras being key and vision. Yeah. And that, so a, a smart

497
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:04,665
Speaker 6:  display really does sort of tie a lot of what

498
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:08,585
Speaker 6:  you've talked about together. Yeah. In theory, unless you have an entirely

499
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:12,345
Speaker 6:  new form factor for this that we don't, that you can share now, but is this

500
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:14,985
Speaker 6:  something that is part of what you see as

501
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:20,465
Speaker 6:  integral to that sort of core hardware where you said, you said at

502
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:23,265
Speaker 6:  the beginning that you're gonna focus on producing the, the core hardware

503
00:31:23,265 --> 00:31:27,065
Speaker 6:  and, and if it is key, why, what's, what's important about the smart display?

504
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:31,145
Speaker 7:  I guess the preempt, given that we're not sharing any explicit news

505
00:31:31,145 --> 00:31:35,105
Speaker 7:  about smart displays, the way that I'll just say it is we are

506
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:38,025
Speaker 7:  definitely committed to smart displays while we're not announcing anything.

507
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:41,465
Speaker 7:  Now, you should definitely expect that we'll have news to share there

508
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:45,705
Speaker 7:  soon. And I think the reason that I'm excited about this category is if you

509
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:49,545
Speaker 7:  think about, you know, how all these LLM technologies are

510
00:31:49,545 --> 00:31:53,225
Speaker 7:  sort of converging, it does present itself as a

511
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:57,735
Speaker 7:  like, incredible form factor to interact with something like Gemini for home,

512
00:31:57,745 --> 00:32:01,255
Speaker 7:  right? Yeah. Like you think about the properties of a smart display microphone,

513
00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:05,295
Speaker 7:  which means audio in speaker, audio out. So it's great

514
00:32:05,295 --> 00:32:08,935
Speaker 7:  for audio and audio out. It's got a screen, which means to

515
00:32:08,935 --> 00:32:12,655
Speaker 7:  compliment sort of a voice modality. You can sort of interact with it,

516
00:32:12,915 --> 00:32:16,735
Speaker 7:  you can sort of visualize information, you know, we've got cameras in them.

517
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:20,455
Speaker 7:  So you get that, that's a vision piece to it as well. So I think, you know,

518
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:23,575
Speaker 7:  as I see where Gemini for home is going, and Gemini more broadly is going

519
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:27,175
Speaker 7:  all of the things that Google is investing in building, for me, it feels

520
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:31,055
Speaker 7:  like the almost at a ultimate form factor to be able to deliver like

521
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:35,015
Speaker 7:  a really great home experience. So that's, that's why we are gonna

522
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:38,935
Speaker 7:  continue to invest in that category. So I'm, I I I think it's gonna be awesome.

523
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:43,365
Speaker 1:  A lot of people I think have correctly identified a lot of the same problems

524
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:46,205
Speaker 1:  that you have with the smart home, right? And I think a lot of people also

525
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:49,965
Speaker 1:  think LLMs are gonna help fix it. But you work for Google, which

526
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:54,485
Speaker 1:  also has this unbelievably gigantic trove of

527
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:58,445
Speaker 1:  information in real time and not about every

528
00:32:58,445 --> 00:33:01,525
Speaker 1:  person on earth. And as you talk about like multimodal,

529
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:06,285
Speaker 1:  you know, multimodal input and understanding more about people's context,

530
00:33:06,475 --> 00:33:10,325
Speaker 1:  like it's all just sitting there for you if you want it. So like,

531
00:33:10,325 --> 00:33:13,965
Speaker 1:  is is the, is the end of this road that like my smart home

532
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:18,565
Speaker 1:  not only knows where I am, but has like read my email and my

533
00:33:18,565 --> 00:33:22,125
Speaker 1:  Google Maps history and knows what I shopped for and actually can like

534
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,805
Speaker 1:  preheat the oven for me without even me having to ask. And that I just live

535
00:33:25,805 --> 00:33:28,605
Speaker 1:  my life. And because Google knows everything about me, it starts to solve

536
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:31,045
Speaker 1:  my life for me. Is that, is that the end of this road

537
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:35,565
Speaker 7:  On the point around having access to all

538
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:39,445
Speaker 7:  this information? I think what we build with it is going to start

539
00:33:39,665 --> 00:33:43,605
Speaker 7:  and end with like with trust, right? So you've gotta

540
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:47,525
Speaker 7:  be able to trust the sort of assistant that you're

541
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:51,445
Speaker 7:  bringing into your home. And so I think, you know, we've got like as broader

542
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:55,005
Speaker 7:  Google and certainly in the context of the home, we definitely have to earn

543
00:33:55,005 --> 00:33:58,885
Speaker 7:  that trust. We, we thought so deeply about what it

544
00:33:58,885 --> 00:34:02,845
Speaker 7:  meant to bring Gemini into the home, which is why we started with, hey, this

545
00:34:02,845 --> 00:34:06,685
Speaker 7:  is going to be a communal experience first because we don't

546
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:09,765
Speaker 7:  want to skirt around the ideas that you might

547
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:13,485
Speaker 7:  accidentally have access. Like my, like my partner might accidentally have

548
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:17,245
Speaker 7:  access to my personal interactions with Gemini and stuff like that. Now I

549
00:34:17,245 --> 00:34:20,965
Speaker 7:  can see definitely like us continuing to invest there with the right,

550
00:34:21,145 --> 00:34:24,445
Speaker 7:  you know, maybe Jen, to your point with the right sort of sensors and ability

551
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:27,445
Speaker 7:  to authenticate that it's actually a niche alone in the room

552
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:31,805
Speaker 7:  talking to Gemini, then in that case, yes, I, I should have

553
00:34:31,805 --> 00:34:35,125
Speaker 7:  access, but if there's other people in the room, I probably don't, right?

554
00:34:35,235 --> 00:34:39,125
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I don't want my credit card details or a personal interaction about

555
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:43,205
Speaker 7:  what cough medicine I might have wanted to use last week when I had a sore

556
00:34:43,205 --> 00:34:46,965
Speaker 7:  throat to be sort of like displayed out to everyone. So, so I think we we're

557
00:34:47,205 --> 00:34:50,525
Speaker 7:  approaching it in a way that we wanna be very thoughtful, especially in a

558
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:54,445
Speaker 7:  communal environment. Like how do you utilize the right set

559
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:58,205
Speaker 7:  of contexts and history about the person and do that in a

560
00:34:58,205 --> 00:35:01,805
Speaker 7:  thoughtful way, in a way that sort of preserves trust long term? Because

561
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:05,565
Speaker 7:  I don't think, David, we get to, I, I, I think the, the thing you

562
00:35:05,565 --> 00:35:09,485
Speaker 7:  described is definitely a place that we would love to get to, but

563
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:13,045
Speaker 7:  we have to do it methodically and thoughtfully that, that maintains trust

564
00:35:13,055 --> 00:35:14,365
Speaker 7:  along that journey the entire way.

565
00:35:14,525 --> 00:35:18,045
Speaker 1:  I just think it's interesting because you, you, that's a different problem

566
00:35:18,045 --> 00:35:21,005
Speaker 1:  than everybody else has, right? Everybody else has that problem and also

567
00:35:21,005 --> 00:35:24,965
Speaker 1:  doesn't know what's in my email. And so I think you're, you're just in this

568
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:29,045
Speaker 1:  position of like, you have to solve the creepy

569
00:35:29,075 --> 00:35:32,805
Speaker 1:  problem, not the where is David problem,

570
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:36,925
Speaker 1:  right? Like, knowing where I am is not hard for Google. It's, it just isn't

571
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,705
Speaker 1:  hard for Google in a way that is hard for almost every company. You have

572
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:43,865
Speaker 1:  to reflect back to me where I am without freaking me out about it. And I

573
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:46,185
Speaker 1:  think in a lot of ways that might actually be the harder problem to solve.

574
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:50,385
Speaker 7:  I I I think that's true, not just for us though. I think it with any sort

575
00:35:50,385 --> 00:35:54,185
Speaker 7:  of like new technology, right? The, not with any new

576
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:57,945
Speaker 7:  technology, but with a lot of new technologies, the line between, between

577
00:35:57,975 --> 00:36:01,505
Speaker 7:  cool and creepy can be a very fine line, right? Oh, and it like

578
00:36:01,605 --> 00:36:03,225
Speaker 1:  Dances all over the place all the time. Yes.

579
00:36:03,425 --> 00:36:06,825
Speaker 7:  Or, or it constantly evolves, right? Yeah. And I think the onus is on us

580
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:10,065
Speaker 7:  as product builders, which to say

581
00:36:10,865 --> 00:36:14,405
Speaker 7:  people are comfortable moving the line if they can

582
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:18,325
Speaker 7:  crisply understand what it does for them and whether or

583
00:36:18,325 --> 00:36:21,885
Speaker 7:  not it adds, actually adds value to their life. Yeah. And then do they trust

584
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:26,045
Speaker 7:  the person building them and giving them that thing, right? Yeah. So, so

585
00:36:26,045 --> 00:36:29,045
Speaker 7:  that's why I think there's, there's two big parts we have to get right, which

586
00:36:29,045 --> 00:36:32,885
Speaker 7:  is one, you've gotta enough, like you've gotta deliver enough value

587
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,965
Speaker 7:  to the user to their lives that says, okay, this is cool

588
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:40,525
Speaker 7:  enough that I'm willing to, to give you permission to do these things.

589
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:45,445
Speaker 7:  And then do they trust you as sort of an entity or a company

590
00:36:45,465 --> 00:36:48,965
Speaker 7:  or a product builder to do that? And so I think if we can, if we can, you

591
00:36:48,965 --> 00:36:52,805
Speaker 7:  know, do those two things really well, then I think we

592
00:36:52,805 --> 00:36:55,085
Speaker 7:  could actually make people's lives in their home a lot easier.

593
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,445
Speaker 1:  All right. That's a good place for us to end, I think.

594
00:38:00,885 --> 00:38:04,565
Speaker 8:  big business idea into reality, which Shopify on your side. Sign

598
00:40:11,265 --> 00:40:11,485
Speaker 12:  Hi.

599
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:14,645
Speaker 1:  I mean, fine. We can talk about the glasses. You wanna talk about the glasses?

600
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:17,725
Speaker 1:  Let's talk about the glasses. We're, we're, we're here to talk about Peloton,

601
00:40:17,905 --> 00:40:21,205
Speaker 1:  but you can't just show up on camera with me and wearing these glasses and

602
00:40:21,205 --> 00:40:24,885
Speaker 1:  we're not gonna talk about it for two minutes. So you, you are wearing

603
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:28,965
Speaker 1:  the, let me hold on. I'm gonna try and get the name right. I, the, the

604
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:30,605
Speaker 1:  Ray band meta display,

605
00:40:31,455 --> 00:40:32,555
Speaker 12:  The meta ray band

606
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,795
Speaker 1:  Display, the, god damn it. Okay.

607
00:40:33,995 --> 00:40:34,755
Speaker 12:  I know whatever

608
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:38,475
Speaker 1:  You're wearing, I know Meta's new smart glasses with a screen. We're gonna

609
00:40:38,475 --> 00:40:41,875
Speaker 1:  talk much more about this in a, in a future episode sometime in the next

610
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:44,195
Speaker 1:  couple of weeks when you finish your review, but you've now been wearing

611
00:40:44,195 --> 00:40:47,675
Speaker 1:  these things for a little while. Gimme, gimme 60 seconds. How are you feeling

612
00:40:47,675 --> 00:40:47,995
Speaker 1:  so far?

613
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:52,315
Speaker 12:  It's very genuine. The hardware is impressive,

614
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:56,715
Speaker 12:  but the software, they really need to get this

615
00:40:57,275 --> 00:41:00,915
Speaker 12:  API that they just opened up to third parties going, the

616
00:41:00,915 --> 00:41:04,835
Speaker 12:  neural band is surprisingly good. I actually think

617
00:41:04,835 --> 00:41:07,475
Speaker 12:  the neural band is kind of the most interesting thing about this.

618
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:10,435
Speaker 1:  That's the thing you, it's like a, you wear it on your wrist and use it to

619
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:11,115
Speaker 1:  control the

620
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:14,115
Speaker 12:  Yes, it's this little guy and you do, oh, it looks like a

621
00:41:14,115 --> 00:41:15,035
Speaker 1:  Whoop it, it just looks

622
00:41:15,035 --> 00:41:17,795
Speaker 12:  Like a whoop. It does look like a whoop, it just looks, it's very unobtrusive.

623
00:41:18,715 --> 00:41:21,915
Speaker 12:  Interesting. It does work if you have to wear another smart watch, which

624
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:25,995
Speaker 12:  I have taken off because it is embargoed, but like it does work if you

625
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:28,675
Speaker 12:  have another smartwatch on there, which I was like, oh, thank God I'm running

626
00:41:28,675 --> 00:41:32,395
Speaker 12:  out of body parts. Like I have to test all of these things and yeah, I can't

627
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:35,925
Speaker 12:  just give up real estate on this wrist without, you know,

628
00:41:36,465 --> 00:41:38,405
Speaker 12:  so that was a relief to me personally.

629
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:43,965
Speaker 12:  Yeah, it's, it's interesting, I literally had to listen to

630
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:48,085
Speaker 12:  a lecture from my spouse this morning about why they think these look

631
00:41:48,285 --> 00:41:52,205
Speaker 12:  terrible on me. So we'll get into that. Maybe

632
00:41:52,265 --> 00:41:56,085
Speaker 12:  the style section of my review is just a video of them going off

633
00:41:56,265 --> 00:41:59,165
Speaker 12:  for 30 minutes and you can choose to listen to it or not.

634
00:42:01,315 --> 00:42:05,045
Speaker 12:  It's, it's, it's a very intriguing product. Do I think

635
00:42:05,185 --> 00:42:08,045
Speaker 12:  the rollout was botched? Yes, absolutely. And

636
00:42:09,645 --> 00:42:12,885
Speaker 12:  I think people are gonna be talking about it and for good reason. There's

637
00:42:12,885 --> 00:42:16,365
Speaker 12:  a lot of meaty stuff to dig into, but is it

638
00:42:17,095 --> 00:42:20,215
Speaker 12:  the future? We'll see, we'll see.

639
00:42:20,685 --> 00:42:24,295
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Well, we're gonna come back to it. My, my read so far is that

640
00:42:24,935 --> 00:42:28,825
Speaker 1:  they look both like vastly better than almost

641
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:33,265
Speaker 1:  anything we've seen and still kind of bad. They're, they're in a like

642
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:37,785
Speaker 1:  uncanny valley kind of situation of like, I look at those glasses And

643
00:42:38,465 --> 00:42:42,425
Speaker 1:  I don't clock them as glasses, I clock them as something else. Do you

644
00:42:42,425 --> 00:42:45,625
Speaker 1:  know what I mean? But it but you don't look at it like it's not, it's obviously

645
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:48,385
Speaker 1:  not like a vision pro, right? It's not like, oh my God, what is that gadget

646
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:50,705
Speaker 1:  on your face? But it's like you look at those and there's something just

647
00:42:50,705 --> 00:42:54,265
Speaker 1:  like slightly wrong with the pair of glasses V is wearing and yeah,

648
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:55,385
Speaker 1:  it's throwing me,

649
00:42:55,665 --> 00:42:59,105
Speaker 12:  I think if you, if you look at me in person, like one-on-one like this,

650
00:42:59,165 --> 00:43:02,945
Speaker 12:  you might feel that way. But if I, you know, I was walking throughout New York

651
00:43:02,945 --> 00:43:06,385
Speaker 12:  City yesterday, commuting to the office, nobody looked at me twice.

652
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:09,865
Speaker 1:  I I believe that. So, which is a huge deal. Yeah. Like that is, that is more

653
00:43:09,865 --> 00:43:12,425
Speaker 1:  the bar than almost anything else. Yeah. With, with a lot of these things.

654
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:15,345
Speaker 1:  But all right. That's not what we're here to talk about. No, again, we're

655
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:17,905
Speaker 1:  gonna come back and talk about this because I have, I have a thousand things

656
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:20,825
Speaker 1:  I wanna talk about about these, but that's for another time I wanna talk

657
00:43:20,825 --> 00:43:24,265
Speaker 1:  about Peloton because there was a lot of gadget news

658
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:29,025
Speaker 1:  this fall. I, I found this big swing

659
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:32,825
Speaker 1:  from Peloton as interesting as anything else that has come out

660
00:43:32,845 --> 00:43:36,425
Speaker 1:  And I just, I just wanna talk through it. So I kind of left

661
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:40,745
Speaker 1:  Peloton behind in my brain as like an interesting company, right? This

662
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:44,385
Speaker 1:  is like, if you rewind five years, the, the pandemic happens.

663
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:48,705
Speaker 1:  Peloton spikes like crazy because lots of people suddenly want and need what

664
00:43:48,705 --> 00:43:52,585
Speaker 1:  it provides. Pelotons doing great, it becomes like culturally relevant because

665
00:43:52,685 --> 00:43:55,905
Speaker 1:  its instructors start to become famous. So Peloton like has a moment and

666
00:43:55,905 --> 00:43:58,545
Speaker 1:  then fades, right? And goes through a bunch of leadership changes and has

667
00:43:58,545 --> 00:44:02,425
Speaker 1:  huge hardware issues and pivots and pivots and changes and

668
00:44:02,425 --> 00:44:05,545
Speaker 1:  everything. And I just kind of like relegated Peloton to like

669
00:44:06,465 --> 00:44:09,705
Speaker 1:  a thing that will probably keep being around for a while but has maybe

670
00:44:10,805 --> 00:44:13,545
Speaker 1:  jumped the shark and will never quite get it back.

671
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:18,465
Speaker 1:  Then Peloton just comes out absolutely swinging for the

672
00:44:18,605 --> 00:44:21,865
Speaker 1:  fences with a bunch of new stuff and new ideas.

673
00:44:23,085 --> 00:44:26,505
Speaker 1:  So just sort of walk me through this like new generation of Peloton stuff

674
00:44:26,535 --> 00:44:29,025
Speaker 1:  that just launched before we get into what it all means. Like what, what

675
00:44:29,025 --> 00:44:29,745
Speaker 1:  is all of this stuff?

676
00:44:30,205 --> 00:44:33,985
Speaker 12:  So basically for the first time in Pelotons history, they have refreshed

677
00:44:33,995 --> 00:44:37,945
Speaker 12:  their entire product lineup. So there is an, there are two new bikes,

678
00:44:38,005 --> 00:44:41,985
Speaker 12:  two new treadmills and a new rower. And they basically were

679
00:44:41,985 --> 00:44:45,185
Speaker 12:  like, they got a little syringe, put a bunch of AI into that syringe and

680
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:49,105
Speaker 12:  injected it into these products. There's something called Peloton iq

681
00:44:50,925 --> 00:44:54,305
Speaker 12:  and so the there, oh God, okay, so there's two tiers of products.

682
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:58,505
Speaker 12:  There's the regular bike and the regular treadmill. Those do not

683
00:44:58,735 --> 00:45:02,705
Speaker 12:  have a camera in them, but everything else now has a

684
00:45:02,795 --> 00:45:05,465
Speaker 12:  handy dandy little swivel camera. You can like plus

685
00:45:05,465 --> 00:45:08,185
Speaker 1:  Means camera, right? Is like essentially way I think about

686
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:11,505
Speaker 12:  It Camera. Okay. Yeah. Plus means camera. And this camera is basically like

687
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:15,065
Speaker 12:  if you took the Peloton guide, which is what I would call their first

688
00:45:15,225 --> 00:45:18,945
Speaker 12:  bonafide hardware flop, it was a little, it kind of

689
00:45:19,105 --> 00:45:21,625
Speaker 12:  reminded me of the Microsoft Connect. You stuck it on your TV and it looked

690
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:25,265
Speaker 12:  like a little webcam and you did strength training exercises with it and

691
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:28,785
Speaker 12:  it would kind of analyze your form, not give you very much feedback. And

692
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:32,505
Speaker 12:  so it was just like, all right, this is a thing. But now they've stuck that

693
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:36,185
Speaker 12:  and they squished it into their existing products and now it does give you

694
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:40,065
Speaker 12:  feedback. The AI will look at you doing strength training exercises and

695
00:45:40,065 --> 00:45:43,505
Speaker 12:  be like, Hey girl, I think you need to go up in weights. Or man, your form

696
00:45:43,525 --> 00:45:46,985
Speaker 12:  is really bad, so why don't you go down and wait so that you do that exercise

697
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:50,865
Speaker 12:  better. So those are in those devices now all of the devices plus and

698
00:45:50,895 --> 00:45:54,345
Speaker 12:  Nonplus have swivel screens. So you can just

699
00:45:54,735 --> 00:45:58,705
Speaker 12:  whip that screen around. So if you're not in a tiny space, you can

700
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:01,985
Speaker 12:  just like fold out the screen and do your strength exercises, your yoga

701
00:46:02,345 --> 00:46:05,945
Speaker 12:  exercises, oozy, whaty, whatever. The plus

702
00:46:05,945 --> 00:46:09,705
Speaker 12:  models, again, sorry to jump around, but the plus models also now have a

703
00:46:09,705 --> 00:46:13,505
Speaker 12:  fan in them because Peloton fans are like, man, it sure does get hot

704
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:14,785
Speaker 12:  when you're doing cardio. Like

705
00:46:14,825 --> 00:46:18,665
Speaker 1:  A fan for your face. Yes, I hear, I hear fan in like a gadget context. I'm

706
00:46:18,665 --> 00:46:21,305
Speaker 1:  like, oh, it's inside to keep the thing from overheating. It's to keep you

707
00:46:21,305 --> 00:46:22,025
Speaker 1:  from overheating.

708
00:46:22,495 --> 00:46:25,625
Speaker 12:  It's to keep you from overheating. Yeah. It's like on top of the display

709
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:29,225
Speaker 12:  there's like this, this cam that where the camera's also built in,

710
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,985
Speaker 12:  like there's just this fan, it's adjustable speed.

711
00:46:33,205 --> 00:46:37,105
Speaker 12:  So when you're working out you, you can cool down,

712
00:46:37,105 --> 00:46:40,745
Speaker 12:  there's a phone tray. Now the bikes have a sier

713
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:44,345
Speaker 12:  seat, so it's more cushy for your tushy, which is what I wanted to write

714
00:46:44,345 --> 00:46:45,945
Speaker 12:  in my hands on. But I was like, that's a little much,

715
00:46:45,945 --> 00:46:48,865
Speaker 1:  That's a headline. I don't know, I don't, we missed opportunity with the

716
00:46:48,985 --> 00:46:49,105
Speaker 1:  headline

717
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:52,545
Speaker 12:  Missed. Yeah. So you know, they, they've done a bunch of hardware updates.

718
00:46:52,565 --> 00:46:56,345
Speaker 12:  Oh, Sonos had a hand with the new speakers. The plus models

719
00:46:56,345 --> 00:46:59,945
Speaker 12:  have a a wolfer now. So when the base drops,

720
00:47:00,435 --> 00:47:04,305
Speaker 12:  Sonos has done the tuning and the equalizing for those. So I guess to

721
00:47:04,305 --> 00:47:07,465
Speaker 12:  ensure that the base drop really hits when you're in your workout.

722
00:47:08,055 --> 00:47:10,905
Speaker 12:  Sure. The entire interface has been changed around,

723
00:47:12,085 --> 00:47:15,825
Speaker 12:  you know, you can better integrate with your third party devices and

724
00:47:16,425 --> 00:47:20,385
Speaker 12:  services so that you can import all of your exercise data and the AI

725
00:47:20,385 --> 00:47:24,185
Speaker 12:  will be like, hmm, let me give you insights. So

726
00:47:24,935 --> 00:47:28,825
Speaker 12:  it's, it's a lot. It's a, it's a pretty much a total revamp of

727
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:31,085
Speaker 12:  the everything. Yeah. From

728
00:47:31,165 --> 00:47:34,975
Speaker 1:  A pure hardware perspective there. Do you look at that and

729
00:47:34,995 --> 00:47:38,855
Speaker 1:  say, okay, Peloton is like trying hard to get

730
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:42,595
Speaker 1:  all the people who bought a bike eight years ago

731
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:46,675
Speaker 1:  or a treadmill five years ago and trying to get those people to buy

732
00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:50,235
Speaker 1:  a new one or is this like a swing at people who have never bought a Peloton

733
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:50,475
Speaker 1:  before?

734
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:54,475
Speaker 12:  I think it's both. Okay. I definitely, it

735
00:47:54,475 --> 00:47:57,355
Speaker 12:  confuses me a little bit though because you would expect that if they want

736
00:47:57,355 --> 00:48:01,235
Speaker 12:  their existing customers to upgrade that there would be

737
00:48:01,235 --> 00:48:04,715
Speaker 12:  some sort of trade-in program. But from what I've seen, sure. And from what

738
00:48:05,945 --> 00:48:09,195
Speaker 12:  Peloton diehards have been DMing me, that does not look to be the case.

739
00:48:10,895 --> 00:48:14,715
Speaker 12:  You can't just trade in your bike plus and get a new bike plus,

740
00:48:14,715 --> 00:48:18,435
Speaker 12:  which I, that's a bummer. Think is, that's a bummer. Yeah. So

741
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:22,435
Speaker 12:  that's kind of surprising I think because, you know, is Peloton,

742
00:48:22,435 --> 00:48:24,075
Speaker 12:  these do not come cheap.

743
00:48:25,735 --> 00:48:29,635
Speaker 12:  So that's strange. But I really feel, and like I went to

744
00:48:29,635 --> 00:48:33,075
Speaker 12:  this little keynote event that they had in New York City same day as the

745
00:48:33,075 --> 00:48:36,835
Speaker 12:  Amazon event. So we're a lot of really tired tech journalists at this event.

746
00:48:38,295 --> 00:48:42,075
Speaker 12:  But you know, they were saying this is a new era for Peloton.

747
00:48:42,265 --> 00:48:46,235
Speaker 12:  This is gonna bust everything wide open. And you

748
00:48:46,235 --> 00:48:49,795
Speaker 12:  know, I am a fitness AI

749
00:48:50,685 --> 00:48:54,035
Speaker 12:  hater, I'm just gonna say it, I'm a hater. Sure. I've tested, I've tested

750
00:48:54,135 --> 00:48:58,035
Speaker 12:  the whoops ai. Whereas ai, all of these AI Garmin

751
00:48:58,415 --> 00:49:01,635
Speaker 12:  Strava fucking sucks. It's

752
00:49:02,755 --> 00:49:06,035
Speaker 12:  regurgitated book reports. Yes. They're not

753
00:49:06,395 --> 00:49:09,675
Speaker 12:  particularly useful. The only ones that I've been

754
00:49:10,135 --> 00:49:14,035
Speaker 12:  mildly intrigued by are what Google's working on and is gonna be rolling

755
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:17,955
Speaker 12:  out sometime later this month for the for on Fitbit,

756
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,395
Speaker 12:  which is the AI coach that they have on there. And Pelotons is

757
00:49:21,395 --> 00:49:24,755
Speaker 12:  surprisingly like, I got to see a demo of a fictional

758
00:49:25,025 --> 00:49:28,555
Speaker 12:  Peloton user named Amy and like the insights that she was getting from

759
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:32,375
Speaker 12:  Peloton IQ And I was like, okay, maybe

760
00:49:33,445 --> 00:49:36,475
Speaker 12:  we'll see. 'cause you know, demos are such, they're

761
00:49:36,965 --> 00:49:40,795
Speaker 12:  guardrails so you can't really get a real, I mean I got a demo

762
00:49:40,795 --> 00:49:43,835
Speaker 12:  of these glasses And I was like, whoa. And now that I'm using them in real

763
00:49:43,835 --> 00:49:47,355
Speaker 12:  life, I'm like, ah, now I find some problems and some issues. So,

764
00:49:48,015 --> 00:49:51,955
Speaker 12:  you know, I saw the the demo And I was like, okay, these are

765
00:49:52,015 --> 00:49:55,995
Speaker 12:  the types of insights that athletes would want. Like if you're doing a strengths

766
00:49:56,115 --> 00:50:00,075
Speaker 12:  training program and you're new to strengths training and you're

767
00:50:00,075 --> 00:50:03,115
Speaker 12:  not really sure when you should go up in weights, this will tell you like

768
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:06,555
Speaker 12:  Hey, you've been doing chest presses at 25 pounds for two weeks

769
00:50:06,985 --> 00:50:10,795
Speaker 12:  next week you should really be either upping the reps or upping

770
00:50:11,065 --> 00:50:14,795
Speaker 12:  your weight just so that you maintain progressive overload that's

771
00:50:14,905 --> 00:50:18,635
Speaker 12:  genuinely useful. Versus an AI going like, you ran 35

772
00:50:18,645 --> 00:50:22,395
Speaker 12:  miles and it was slightly slower than your average. Jesus

773
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:25,835
Speaker 12:  Christ. Thank you. I I can also read my own metrics and come to that conclusion.

774
00:50:25,965 --> 00:50:26,315
Speaker 12:  Right.

775
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:30,005
Speaker 1:  Well, but that's the thing. So this, this is, I think the trick and the

776
00:50:30,005 --> 00:50:33,725
Speaker 1:  challenge we've run into with a lot of these things is that what they

777
00:50:33,725 --> 00:50:37,005
Speaker 1:  give you is this incredibly basic feedback

778
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:41,525
Speaker 1:  on an incredibly advanced device, right? Yes. And I think like

779
00:50:41,525 --> 00:50:44,165
Speaker 1:  the stuff with Peloton for me, and, and the thing I've been trying to figure

780
00:50:44,165 --> 00:50:48,085
Speaker 1:  out for years is whether Peloton is eventually going

781
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:52,005
Speaker 1:  to go like way down market and start to be like, okay, actually

782
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:55,525
Speaker 1:  the bike is free and all you have to pay for is a subscription. And that,

783
00:50:55,545 --> 00:50:59,125
Speaker 1:  that's how Peloton gets like a whole new type of person

784
00:50:59,545 --> 00:51:03,125
Speaker 1:  to be a Peloton person. Or if it's gonna go the other way and do the, the

785
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:07,085
Speaker 1:  sort of like, you know, go after the, the Garmin people

786
00:51:07,225 --> 00:51:11,085
Speaker 1:  in the world who are like, no, I'm serious about this And I want tools

787
00:51:11,085 --> 00:51:14,405
Speaker 1:  that help me get more serious. And that gets more expensive. It does more

788
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:18,365
Speaker 1:  stuff. And so my, my read of a lot of this announcement is it is like ramping

789
00:51:18,365 --> 00:51:22,325
Speaker 1:  up the seriousness for people who are already serious, right? And these

790
00:51:22,325 --> 00:51:26,205
Speaker 1:  things got more expensive. They, the, the subscription went up,

791
00:51:26,205 --> 00:51:29,885
Speaker 1:  there's more stuff. And so for me it's like you, you got this demo of

792
00:51:29,885 --> 00:51:33,405
Speaker 1:  someone basically like doing bad form. I think you said they were doing overhead

793
00:51:33,405 --> 00:51:37,325
Speaker 1:  dumbbell presses. And it will, like, if you do comically bad

794
00:51:37,325 --> 00:51:40,605
Speaker 1:  form, it will, it will tell you you're doing a bad job and do better

795
00:51:41,755 --> 00:51:45,485
Speaker 1:  fine. That, that to me is like the equivalent of an

796
00:51:45,825 --> 00:51:49,605
Speaker 1:  AR device that looks at a bag of nuts that says nuts in big

797
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:52,685
Speaker 1:  letters and can tell me it's a bag of nuts. Like that's not nothing, but

798
00:51:52,685 --> 00:51:55,965
Speaker 1:  it's not much. What I need is the stuff that is

799
00:51:56,385 --> 00:52:00,205
Speaker 1:  vastly more nuanced and subtle and it's like, you're doing

800
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:03,525
Speaker 1:  a pretty good job. Here's how you could be doing a really good job. Like

801
00:52:03,525 --> 00:52:06,685
Speaker 1:  that's what the people who are buying these things want and need, and that's

802
00:52:06,685 --> 00:52:10,445
Speaker 1:  the level that they're at. And I think it's just a much harder

803
00:52:10,445 --> 00:52:14,285
Speaker 1:  technology problem. And so I think, I think you're, you're right to be skeptical

804
00:52:14,285 --> 00:52:17,925
Speaker 1:  even of the demos because it's like, it's one thing to see me going like

805
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:20,645
Speaker 1:  this and be like, that's not right. But if I'm like, almost right,

806
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:25,185
Speaker 1:  and it tells me how to do it exactly right. Like that's the actual stuff

807
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,145
Speaker 1:  and that's a way harder thing to do.

808
00:52:27,735 --> 00:52:30,825
Speaker 12:  It's very hard. And it's like that's, it's, it's hard even if you have a

809
00:52:30,825 --> 00:52:34,465
Speaker 12:  in-person personal trainer. So that's, it's a right,

810
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:36,425
Speaker 1:  That's what people pay a lot of money for. That's

811
00:52:36,425 --> 00:52:40,305
Speaker 12:  What people pay a lot of money for. It's, it's an access thing because it's

812
00:52:40,305 --> 00:52:44,025
Speaker 12:  so, it is so much easier to do fitness if it's in your home that that's

813
00:52:44,025 --> 00:52:47,745
Speaker 12:  just true if you are a beginner, I can see this

814
00:52:47,745 --> 00:52:50,705
Speaker 12:  being helpful in a lot of different ways. But again, the people who would

815
00:52:50,705 --> 00:52:54,185
Speaker 12:  be most interested in those features are not the beginners. So

816
00:52:54,495 --> 00:52:58,265
Speaker 12:  it's, it's, they call it the cross training series because

817
00:52:58,445 --> 00:53:01,785
Speaker 12:  on the one hand you have your cardio device and your preferred method of

818
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,705
Speaker 12:  indoor cardio. And so now you can cross train and do other things and

819
00:53:06,205 --> 00:53:09,505
Speaker 12:  get this form feedback, which, you know, form feedback.

820
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,265
Speaker 12:  I will say of all the

821
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:16,785
Speaker 12:  exercise modality strength training is the thing that stumps all

822
00:53:16,785 --> 00:53:20,705
Speaker 12:  the technology companies the most. It's really like Ladder is

823
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:24,265
Speaker 12:  the only strength training app that I really resonated with. And did

824
00:53:24,295 --> 00:53:27,805
Speaker 12:  Peloton steal everything for its strength training app from Ladder?

825
00:53:28,155 --> 00:53:31,045
Speaker 12:  Yeah. Well, I don't know. Go to Reddit. People are having that conversation

826
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:31,245
Speaker 12:  there.

827
00:53:31,435 --> 00:53:34,845
Speaker 1:  Yeah, the general vibe on Pelotons strength app is, oh, they just did Ladder.

828
00:53:35,525 --> 00:53:37,965
Speaker 1:  That's which is not Yeah. Not the wrong

829
00:53:38,225 --> 00:53:39,845
Speaker 12:  Choice. No ladder's great

830
00:53:39,905 --> 00:53:40,685
Speaker 1:  Choice. Yeah.

831
00:53:41,065 --> 00:53:44,965
Speaker 12:  Ladder actually has helped me get into lifting a little bit more consistently

832
00:53:45,075 --> 00:53:49,045
Speaker 12:  than previous iterations have. That's great. But you

833
00:53:49,045 --> 00:53:52,485
Speaker 12:  know, exercise is just such a weird thing because it's individual.

834
00:53:53,695 --> 00:53:56,625
Speaker 12:  What works for one person is absolutely not gonna work for another person.

835
00:53:56,625 --> 00:54:00,225
Speaker 12:  There's no blanket prescription that you can give people. So, but that's

836
00:54:00,225 --> 00:54:00,465
Speaker 12:  so funny.

837
00:54:00,465 --> 00:54:04,385
Speaker 1:  That is like, that exact reason is why it makes perfect sense to me

838
00:54:04,385 --> 00:54:07,705
Speaker 1:  that this is a thing Peloton is doing, right? Because the, the first move

839
00:54:07,725 --> 00:54:11,465
Speaker 1:  is like, okay, how do we take the experience of a class and bring it home?

840
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:14,345
Speaker 1:  And that worked super well, But it does have limitations, right? Whereas

841
00:54:14,345 --> 00:54:17,985
Speaker 1:  it's like that by definition can't be responsive to me

842
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:21,985
Speaker 1:  and what I need. And especially with strength training, that is really important,

843
00:54:21,985 --> 00:54:25,585
Speaker 1:  right? Like I always think about, I, I would do the, the like Peloton

844
00:54:25,735 --> 00:54:29,665
Speaker 1:  yoga stuff on the ground next to the Peloton, like,

845
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:33,865
Speaker 1:  And I, I would fall behind and just fall apart, right? Because like I suck

846
00:54:33,865 --> 00:54:37,745
Speaker 1:  at yoga, they're good at it and they're doing this class for people who

847
00:54:37,745 --> 00:54:41,385
Speaker 1:  are good at it. And like what I need is something that actually is

848
00:54:41,705 --> 00:54:44,345
Speaker 1:  engaging with me in some sort of meaningful way. And so it's like, of course

849
00:54:44,345 --> 00:54:48,185
Speaker 1:  that's the pitch here, right? Like I can absolutely see why

850
00:54:48,215 --> 00:54:51,065
Speaker 1:  Peloton is after this. And there are a bunch of reasons. It actually seems

851
00:54:51,065 --> 00:54:54,785
Speaker 1:  like if anybody can do it, well it ought to be Peloton. It does have access

852
00:54:54,785 --> 00:54:57,505
Speaker 1:  to the hardware, all the stuff you're talking about. Like I think the camera

853
00:54:57,725 --> 00:55:01,185
Speaker 1:  is really fascinating. The swivel screen is really interesting. There's just,

854
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:05,465
Speaker 1:  it has all this historical data on people and me specifically, but

855
00:55:05,465 --> 00:55:09,025
Speaker 1:  also just like people in the aggregate. Like there are a lot of reasons

856
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:13,945
Speaker 1:  if someone can pull this off that it might be Peloton. Am I crazy? Like am

857
00:55:13,985 --> 00:55:15,425
Speaker 1:  I giving Peloton way too much credit here?

858
00:55:15,725 --> 00:55:19,305
Speaker 12:  No, no. Like I talked to their chief product officer, Nick

859
00:55:19,305 --> 00:55:22,745
Speaker 12:  Caldwell at the event and you know, he said a couple of really interesting

860
00:55:22,745 --> 00:55:26,345
Speaker 12:  things. Just, you know, their AI is built on chat,

861
00:55:26,465 --> 00:55:30,225
Speaker 12:  GPT and llama in part, but also it's trained on their

862
00:55:30,545 --> 00:55:34,305
Speaker 12:  thousands of classes, like a lot of thousands of data points. And

863
00:55:34,605 --> 00:55:38,305
Speaker 12:  the AI is integrated in ways beyond just what, how you're

864
00:55:38,415 --> 00:55:42,345
Speaker 12:  like interacting with it. Because it's also in the sense of how they

865
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:46,185
Speaker 12:  surface classes to you. So based on what you need, they're like,

866
00:55:46,185 --> 00:55:49,505
Speaker 12:  well how do we help you find a class that actually helps you in our library

867
00:55:49,645 --> 00:55:53,065
Speaker 12:  of thousands of classes? That's a pain point too, because it's great that

868
00:55:53,065 --> 00:55:56,545
Speaker 12:  they have thousands of classes. But if, you know pe, if you're on Peloton

869
00:55:56,545 --> 00:55:59,225
Speaker 12:  and you're just trying to find something that'll work for you, a instructor

870
00:55:59,225 --> 00:56:02,025
Speaker 12:  that you like, because instructor personalities can be,

871
00:56:03,005 --> 00:56:06,545
Speaker 12:  you know, not every instructor's you're gonna jive with. I really can't

872
00:56:06,545 --> 00:56:09,545
Speaker 12:  stand the ones that are just like, Hey girl, you got this and, and all that.

873
00:56:09,545 --> 00:56:12,745
Speaker 12:  And I'm just like, no, I'm suffering. Please don't try and encourage me.

874
00:56:12,885 --> 00:56:16,825
Speaker 12:  But so, you know, like the AI is also supposed to help you surface a

875
00:56:16,825 --> 00:56:20,585
Speaker 12:  class that you might actually resonate with and might, you know,

876
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:24,525
Speaker 12:  there's a new thing that pops up that tells you if you current

877
00:56:24,785 --> 00:56:28,485
Speaker 12:  effort levels are matched with that class. Like this class might be harder

878
00:56:28,545 --> 00:56:32,445
Speaker 12:  for you than normal is, is what'll pop up when you're browsing.

879
00:56:32,585 --> 00:56:35,725
Speaker 12:  So there's that. I actually think that's way more interesting than the form

880
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:39,045
Speaker 12:  correction, but that's just me. Fair. There's new stuff where you can generate

881
00:56:39,075 --> 00:56:43,005
Speaker 12:  your own workouts that are sans instructors that you can take

882
00:56:43,005 --> 00:56:46,645
Speaker 12:  at your own pace and oh, I like that and moves that you want. So like

883
00:56:46,645 --> 00:56:49,485
Speaker 12:  they're doing a bunch of different things to appeal to a bunch of different

884
00:56:49,485 --> 00:56:53,305
Speaker 12:  people. So they're kind of very thoughtful

885
00:56:53,445 --> 00:56:57,305
Speaker 12:  and smart about how they're going about it in a way that it doesn't feel

886
00:56:57,435 --> 00:57:01,385
Speaker 12:  fully just like, here's ai, let's staple it onto the product. Which is

887
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:05,225
Speaker 12:  what most fitness AI has felt like. So I do think if anyone's

888
00:57:05,225 --> 00:57:08,785
Speaker 12:  gonna do it, it is probably them because they are

889
00:57:08,975 --> 00:57:12,905
Speaker 12:  very clued in to their diehard fan base. Like a lot of the

890
00:57:12,905 --> 00:57:16,265
Speaker 12:  new hardware upgrades are things that people have been yelling at them to

891
00:57:16,685 --> 00:57:20,585
Speaker 12:  fix for a long time. So they are listening to their, to their

892
00:57:20,585 --> 00:57:21,865
Speaker 12:  core constituency.

893
00:57:22,165 --> 00:57:25,225
Speaker 1:  Do you think their core constituency was also like spending a lot of time

894
00:57:25,225 --> 00:57:28,585
Speaker 1:  saying, God, I wish this was all way more expensive. You know, do you feel

895
00:57:28,585 --> 00:57:31,545
Speaker 1:  like that was a bunch of Peloton people being like, you don't have enough

896
00:57:31,545 --> 00:57:33,625
Speaker 1:  of my money. Do you want more of my money? Peloton.

897
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:37,305
Speaker 12:  So I find Peloton diehard like a

898
00:57:37,585 --> 00:57:41,505
Speaker 12:  fascinating group of people. So, you know, I know RIP

899
00:57:41,505 --> 00:57:44,985
Speaker 12:  Jane Goodall, but I consider myself the Jane Goodall of Peloton

900
00:57:45,185 --> 00:57:48,385
Speaker 12:  diehards. I love this for like, I spent some time, I spent some time just

901
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:51,625
Speaker 12:  in like their official groups and on Reddit just reading what they have

902
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:55,585
Speaker 12:  to say about stuff. Because I did a feature last year where I talked to

903
00:57:55,585 --> 00:57:59,305
Speaker 12:  like a dozen Peloton diehards and you know what, the vast

904
00:57:59,585 --> 00:58:02,945
Speaker 12:  majority of them told me that the hardware was

905
00:58:03,955 --> 00:58:07,395
Speaker 12:  integral to their experienceing. And I was just shocked by that because

906
00:58:07,465 --> 00:58:11,315
Speaker 12:  most people I talk to are like, oh my God, it's so expensive. Why not

907
00:58:11,315 --> 00:58:14,835
Speaker 12:  just buy a $500 version and with a tablet holder,

908
00:58:15,005 --> 00:58:16,555
Speaker 12:  right? Bad a bang bad a boom. Well

909
00:58:16,555 --> 00:58:20,075
Speaker 1:  There was, there was a really sort of obvious future for Peloton after this

910
00:58:20,075 --> 00:58:23,355
Speaker 1:  like post pandemic slump that was like, stop being a hardware company.

911
00:58:24,055 --> 00:58:27,955
Speaker 1:  You have a software and you like you're, you're a media company. Like

912
00:58:27,955 --> 00:58:31,915
Speaker 1:  go be an exercise class company and let me run that on any

913
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:35,115
Speaker 1:  treadmill that exists. Like make a, make an API that plugs into every other

914
00:58:35,275 --> 00:58:38,835
Speaker 1:  treadmill, go to the gym. Like the, it becomes like a

915
00:58:39,395 --> 00:58:42,675
Speaker 1:  exercise as a service company. And I have actually been surprised to not

916
00:58:42,975 --> 00:58:46,515
Speaker 1:  see Peloton go more in that direction. But it sounds like that's just because

917
00:58:46,535 --> 00:58:49,555
Speaker 1:  I'm not talking to enough Peloton people that maybe the hardware there's

918
00:58:49,615 --> 00:58:49,835
Speaker 1:  is

919
00:58:49,835 --> 00:58:53,075
Speaker 12:  More the thing's a specific there. So there's like grades of Peloton people,

920
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:57,035
Speaker 12:  there's like the people who are like, I've heard of it. Sure. That's the

921
00:58:57,035 --> 00:59:00,395
Speaker 12:  one where the guy died in sex in the city. And you're like, yes. That, yes.

922
00:59:00,535 --> 00:59:04,275
Speaker 12:  So that's that level of Peloton awareness. And there's the people who, who

923
00:59:04,275 --> 00:59:07,115
Speaker 12:  are like the spouses of Peloton diehards who are just like, yeah,

924
00:59:08,015 --> 00:59:11,875
Speaker 12:  person I live with, they do Peloton And I

925
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:15,395
Speaker 12:  don't get it, but sometimes I use their equipment and yeah, I guess it's

926
00:59:15,395 --> 00:59:19,155
Speaker 12:  nice. And then you have the Peloton diehards and like they are a

927
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:23,085
Speaker 12:  unique group of people. I find them fascinating and you know,

928
00:59:23,085 --> 00:59:26,565
Speaker 12:  when I talk to them, they're like, they're talking in such tones where

929
00:59:27,285 --> 00:59:31,045
Speaker 12:  I don't wanna call them culty, but it's not, not

930
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:34,565
Speaker 12:  culty where they're like, and you know, they also will

931
00:59:35,045 --> 00:59:37,685
Speaker 12:  positively call themselves cult members. So I'm not trying to be derogative

932
00:59:37,685 --> 00:59:40,285
Speaker 12:  here, but they are like,

933
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:45,445
Speaker 12:  Jess King helped me get through a really tough period of my life. Mm. And

934
00:59:45,505 --> 00:59:49,485
Speaker 12:  I'm just like, okay, cool. Yes, you who,

935
00:59:50,025 --> 00:59:53,045
Speaker 12:  who are the instructors you like? And it's very interesting to see who they

936
00:59:53,045 --> 00:59:56,685
Speaker 12:  pick and why and how it relates to their personality. And those people

937
00:59:57,705 --> 01:00:01,605
Speaker 12:  for sure are always like, yeah, I'm thinking about how I can upgrade

938
01:00:02,225 --> 01:00:06,205
Speaker 12:  and it doesn't matter to me how much it costs because it's just so

939
01:00:06,435 --> 01:00:10,165
Speaker 12:  high quality. And so, you know, to us Normies

940
01:00:10,195 --> 01:00:14,085
Speaker 12:  just looking at them going, you're really gonna pay $6,700

941
01:00:14,305 --> 01:00:18,085
Speaker 12:  for a fucking treadmill to them, they're just like, this

942
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:22,045
Speaker 12:  tool fits into my life, right? It is my life.

943
01:00:22,305 --> 01:00:25,965
Speaker 12:  And I don't see this as a ridiculous cost because

944
01:00:26,285 --> 01:00:30,245
Speaker 12:  I use this treadmill every day and you know,

945
01:00:30,395 --> 01:00:34,325
Speaker 12:  it's, my life has changed this, this, this thing.

946
01:00:34,445 --> 01:00:38,365
Speaker 12:  I used to be depressed and sad and now look at me, I'm running 46

947
01:00:38,765 --> 01:00:41,605
Speaker 12:  marathons and I'm like, that's just a different kind of depressed and sad

948
01:00:41,665 --> 01:00:42,565
Speaker 12:  to me personally.

949
01:00:44,825 --> 01:00:46,165
Speaker 12:  No, I love that. For you it's

950
01:00:46,165 --> 01:00:47,645
Speaker 1:  Physically healthier, so go for it. Yeah,

951
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:51,565
Speaker 12:  It's physically healthier. I am concerned because marathons

952
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:55,365
Speaker 12:  are so tired. I know, I have talked to people who have trained for whole

953
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:59,405
Speaker 12:  marathons on a treadmill, on a Peloton treadmill and I'm like, how

954
01:00:59,675 --> 01:01:03,045
Speaker 12:  whoa, I can't do two more than three miles on a treadmill. 'cause I lose

955
01:01:03,065 --> 01:01:06,645
Speaker 12:  my mind. It's so boring. Yeah, I can do, I can run hours

956
01:01:06,715 --> 01:01:10,525
Speaker 12:  outside. I love that. But like the, the treadmill three hours of

957
01:01:10,525 --> 01:01:14,405
Speaker 12:  running, I'm like, how? And you know, one of the people

958
01:01:14,565 --> 01:01:18,445
Speaker 12:  I interviewed, she was just like this bubbly, enthusiastic,

959
01:01:18,445 --> 01:01:22,205
Speaker 12:  lovely lady and she was like, yeah, when I ran my marathon,

960
01:01:22,325 --> 01:01:25,885
Speaker 12:  I had the Peloton app and the outdoor classes

961
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:28,805
Speaker 12:  just going on on a loop. And that's what got me through my marathon outdoors.

962
01:01:28,805 --> 01:01:32,125
Speaker 12:  And I was like, you brought Peloton to S Marathon. Holy crap.

963
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:36,165
Speaker 1:  That is such a telling thing in so many directions that that

964
01:01:36,165 --> 01:01:40,005
Speaker 1:  is the response. That's so interesting. So, okay, so that must mean you

965
01:01:40,005 --> 01:01:43,845
Speaker 1:  look at these prices. 'cause like I look at these prices and see them

966
01:01:43,845 --> 01:01:47,645
Speaker 1:  as sort of shocking. Like Travis, our producer went

967
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:51,525
Speaker 1:  through and did the shockingly difficult work of figuring out

968
01:01:51,525 --> 01:01:55,485
Speaker 1:  how these prices have changed over time and it's kind of nuts. So like,

969
01:01:55,485 --> 01:01:58,525
Speaker 1:  just to give you one example, the the Tread Plus, which is the, the like

970
01:01:58,525 --> 01:02:01,765
Speaker 1:  high end treadmill launched in 2018 and it was

971
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:05,605
Speaker 1:  $4,295, which was a ton. And we talked a lot

972
01:02:05,605 --> 01:02:09,405
Speaker 1:  about how expensive it was. And then in 2023 it jumped to

973
01:02:09,405 --> 01:02:13,195
Speaker 1:  $5,995, which is more just in case

974
01:02:13,195 --> 01:02:15,635
Speaker 1:  you're wondering and then now is

975
01:02:15,685 --> 01:02:19,645
Speaker 1:  $6,695. And that is, that is just what

976
01:02:19,645 --> 01:02:23,485
Speaker 1:  the Tread plus costs. The tread has gone up. It,

977
01:02:23,505 --> 01:02:27,005
Speaker 1:  it went down a little bit then up again, it's more expensive than ever. The

978
01:02:27,145 --> 01:02:31,045
Speaker 1:  Row plus is more expensive than ever. The subscription continues to go

979
01:02:31,045 --> 01:02:34,805
Speaker 1:  up. It's not like everything else is getting cheaper, but like maybe it just

980
01:02:34,805 --> 01:02:38,245
Speaker 1:  is true that this is a group of people who are not super price conscious

981
01:02:38,305 --> 01:02:42,205
Speaker 1:  and the idea of, you know, I'm pitting this against an

982
01:02:42,205 --> 01:02:46,005
Speaker 1:  Equinox membership or like two sessions a week with a personal trainer. And

983
01:02:46,005 --> 01:02:49,965
Speaker 1:  so it's actually not expensive in that context, but like when

984
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:53,805
Speaker 1:  you look at these prices, what does it make you think Peloton is

985
01:02:54,095 --> 01:02:54,725
Speaker 1:  doing here?

986
01:02:55,785 --> 01:02:59,715
Speaker 12:  I'm just like, Baha six, $7,000

987
01:02:59,855 --> 01:03:03,195
Speaker 12:  for for a treadmill. Yeah, running outside is free.

988
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:06,155
Speaker 12:  That's me though, right? Like I,

989
01:03:06,615 --> 01:03:09,555
Speaker 1:  To be fair, running outside is awful and you can't watch the office while

990
01:03:09,555 --> 01:03:12,995
Speaker 1:  you run outside. So like I would pay a lot to be able to watch the office

991
01:03:12,995 --> 01:03:14,115
Speaker 1:  while I run indoors.

992
01:03:14,575 --> 01:03:16,635
Speaker 12:  But again, this is like different people

993
01:03:16,635 --> 01:03:17,515
Speaker 1:  But not 6,700.

994
01:03:18,305 --> 01:03:21,035
Speaker 12:  Yeah, this is different people, different preferences, right? I cannot,

995
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:25,395
Speaker 12:  I've tried watching KDRs and my straight kids videos

996
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:28,475
Speaker 12:  on treadmills. I can't do it. I can't do it for more than 20 minutes. I

997
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:31,755
Speaker 12:  thought I was a terrible runner for years ing because of I just could not

998
01:03:31,755 --> 01:03:35,715
Speaker 12:  do it outside. I can run for three hours and it's just me, my thoughts and

999
01:03:35,805 --> 01:03:37,075
Speaker 12:  K-pop for like three hours. That's so funny.

1000
01:03:37,595 --> 01:03:41,555
Speaker 1:  I the exact opposite. I, yeah. So the best gym trick I ever

1001
01:03:41,835 --> 01:03:44,515
Speaker 1:  discovered, and everyone should try this if you have trouble making yourself

1002
01:03:44,515 --> 01:03:48,315
Speaker 1:  go to the gym, was I found a TV show that I loved And I was only

1003
01:03:48,315 --> 01:03:49,515
Speaker 1:  allowed to watch it at the gym.

1004
01:03:49,755 --> 01:03:50,795
Speaker 12:  I tried that. And so

1005
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:55,315
Speaker 1:  For me, I through like seasons upon seasons running on the

1006
01:03:55,435 --> 01:03:58,435
Speaker 1:  treadmill at the Y because that was just, I was just like, I wanna watch

1007
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:01,635
Speaker 1:  the show so I'm gonna go and watch it on the treadmill. And then literally

1008
01:04:01,665 --> 01:04:05,475
Speaker 1:  it's, it's a like third of a mile from here to the gym

1009
01:04:05,895 --> 01:04:09,755
Speaker 1:  and that run is so boring that I didn't, I,

1010
01:04:09,795 --> 01:04:12,955
Speaker 1:  I didn't wanna do it. I would drive to the gym and run on the treadmill Like

1011
01:04:12,955 --> 01:04:16,715
Speaker 1:  what? Like a true maniac stuff. But yeah, it's just

1012
01:04:16,715 --> 01:04:17,475
Speaker 1:  people are different.

1013
01:04:18,035 --> 01:04:21,675
Speaker 12:  I tried doing that. It does not work for me. So that, that's, that's such

1014
01:04:21,735 --> 01:04:23,755
Speaker 12:  the challenge that they have is

1015
01:04:23,755 --> 01:04:26,755
Speaker 1:  That you're like my dad who ran a marathon with no headphones And I still

1016
01:04:27,045 --> 01:04:29,515
Speaker 1:  think he's no, that's like true psychotic behavior

1017
01:04:29,935 --> 01:04:33,715
Speaker 12:  That's the most psychotic. But I still need the headphones, I still need

1018
01:04:33,735 --> 01:04:37,035
Speaker 12:  my beats. Okay. I I need my little k-pop boys singing,

1019
01:04:37,635 --> 01:04:41,075
Speaker 12:  whatever I, I need that. But you know, I've listened in

1020
01:04:41,415 --> 01:04:44,595
Speaker 12:  to Peloton earnings dutifully every quarter and when they

1021
01:04:45,165 --> 01:04:48,555
Speaker 12:  upped the price to about $6,000, I was like, ha.

1022
01:04:51,255 --> 01:04:53,675
Speaker 12:  And then the next quarter they're like, oh yeah, and we sold out of every,

1023
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:57,835
Speaker 12:  out of all of the stock that we had for $6,000. And I was like, how

1024
01:04:58,255 --> 01:05:02,235
Speaker 12:  so every, every earnings, they're like tread plus the most expensive

1025
01:05:02,235 --> 01:05:05,955
Speaker 12:  product in their portfolio. It sells like gangbusters. And

1026
01:05:06,015 --> 01:05:09,915
Speaker 12:  I'm like, how that's the one where the kids died. How do you

1027
01:05:09,915 --> 01:05:13,515
Speaker 12:  do this? And and the people who love them love them.

1028
01:05:14,075 --> 01:05:17,805
Speaker 12:  I believe it was Business Insider back when like the height of

1029
01:05:17,805 --> 01:05:21,325
Speaker 12:  that controversy was happening. They were like interviewing people who were

1030
01:05:21,325 --> 01:05:25,085
Speaker 12:  like, yeah, I fell down and it threw me through a wall, never giving

1031
01:05:25,185 --> 01:05:29,165
Speaker 12:  it up. And it's just like these people, it resonates

1032
01:05:29,165 --> 01:05:32,925
Speaker 12:  with them in such a way and it creates such a degree of loyalty

1033
01:05:33,075 --> 01:05:37,045
Speaker 12:  that I'm just like, oh my god. And you know, historic, their churn

1034
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:40,525
Speaker 12:  is a little higher than it used to be, but it's still not that much higher

1035
01:05:40,525 --> 01:05:44,445
Speaker 12:  than like one, 1.5%. So these

1036
01:05:44,445 --> 01:05:46,085
Speaker 12:  people really stick with

1037
01:05:46,085 --> 01:05:48,005
Speaker 1:  It, which is like crazy low.

1038
01:05:48,035 --> 01:05:51,445
Speaker 12:  Yeah, it's crazy low for a churn rate of, of subscribers. And

1039
01:05:52,265 --> 01:05:56,005
Speaker 12:  we talk about Peloton churn subscribers being high, it's like 2%. Yeah.

1040
01:05:56,005 --> 01:05:59,725
Speaker 12:  Which is so low if you really think about it in the scale of things.

1041
01:05:59,825 --> 01:06:03,765
Speaker 12:  But you know, whether or not this opens a new chapter for them, I don't

1042
01:06:03,765 --> 01:06:07,365
Speaker 12:  know because their previous CEO Barry McCarthy, who I

1043
01:06:07,565 --> 01:06:11,405
Speaker 12:  absolutely loved because he always had unhinged quotes in the, in

1044
01:06:11,405 --> 01:06:14,845
Speaker 12:  the investor shareholder letter the one time he's like, this, this is a

1045
01:06:14,855 --> 01:06:17,885
Speaker 12:  cargo ship and we are halfway through the Mediterranean. I was like, what

1046
01:06:17,885 --> 01:06:21,725
Speaker 12:  is happening here? But sure, he very much, he very

1047
01:06:21,725 --> 01:06:25,485
Speaker 12:  much went, the reason why the prices are like so hard to track

1048
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:28,005
Speaker 12:  over time was because he was doing a lot of experimenting with the prices

1049
01:06:28,225 --> 01:06:32,045
Speaker 12:  and with the theory that this is a media company and we are

1050
01:06:32,045 --> 01:06:35,725
Speaker 12:  gonna be futzing around with hardware prices, we're gonna see what sticks,

1051
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:39,685
Speaker 12:  we're gonna introduce a rental program, what's happening. He

1052
01:06:39,685 --> 01:06:43,365
Speaker 12:  did a lot of that and the numbers went up like

1053
01:06:44,005 --> 01:06:46,885
Speaker 12:  actually, you know, I tune into these things and the numbers have been going

1054
01:06:46,885 --> 01:06:50,525
Speaker 12:  up for some time, even though it's not pandemic levels of high, in which

1055
01:06:50,525 --> 01:06:54,285
Speaker 12:  case I go, you know, investors, does everything have to be on a constant

1056
01:06:54,285 --> 01:06:58,245
Speaker 12:  state of growth trajectory? Like what if, what if it's just fine being

1057
01:06:58,285 --> 01:07:01,925
Speaker 12:  a mid-size company? Totally. What if, what if? And the investors are always

1058
01:07:01,925 --> 01:07:05,645
Speaker 12:  like, no, you must go to pandemic levels again. And it's like, we don't

1059
01:07:05,645 --> 01:07:05,965
Speaker 12:  do that. I don't

1060
01:07:05,965 --> 01:07:08,925
Speaker 1:  In this country. So last question on this and then, and then we should take

1061
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:12,885
Speaker 1:  a break. I think thinking about these Peloton people, like the the stuff

1062
01:07:12,885 --> 01:07:16,165
Speaker 1:  that you hear them talk about all the time is a, you like, you're like, we've

1063
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:19,125
Speaker 1:  been talking about the hardware is, is a hugely important part of it. People

1064
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:22,085
Speaker 1:  love the classes, people love the instructors, people love the sort of real

1065
01:07:22,085 --> 01:07:25,885
Speaker 1:  time competition of it. There is this sense that you're like part of a

1066
01:07:25,885 --> 01:07:29,485
Speaker 1:  community even though you're inside of your house. Can you, if you're a

1067
01:07:29,485 --> 01:07:33,445
Speaker 1:  Peloton, can you do the AI thing in a way that doesn't

1068
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:36,605
Speaker 1:  ruin that? Like thinking about what you know about all of these Peloton people

1069
01:07:36,665 --> 01:07:40,605
Speaker 1:  is this idea of everything being super individualized and

1070
01:07:40,605 --> 01:07:44,325
Speaker 1:  personalized, but also in a certain way sort of depersonalized that it's

1071
01:07:44,325 --> 01:07:48,205
Speaker 1:  not gonna feel as though you're in a live class full of

1072
01:07:48,205 --> 01:07:51,605
Speaker 1:  people. It's gonna feel like an AI is coaching you on how to do things.

1073
01:07:52,465 --> 01:07:54,005
Speaker 1:  Is that gonna be compelling to those people?

1074
01:07:54,545 --> 01:07:58,445
Speaker 12:  So I think they've been very thoughtful about that because when I went

1075
01:07:58,445 --> 01:08:01,965
Speaker 12:  to this event, and this is just gonna be another

1076
01:08:01,965 --> 01:08:05,845
Speaker 12:  description of the Peloton energy, I go into this event and what do

1077
01:08:05,845 --> 01:08:08,885
Speaker 12:  they do? First of all, they don't introduce the CEO first and no, no, no.

1078
01:08:08,885 --> 01:08:10,245
Speaker 12:  He's, he's an afterthought. They go,

1079
01:08:10,665 --> 01:08:10,885
Speaker 1:  We

1080
01:08:10,885 --> 01:08:14,765
Speaker 12:  Have Tunde, we have Adrian Williams and I'm sorry I forgot the third name

1081
01:08:14,765 --> 01:08:18,605
Speaker 12:  of the, the instructor that was there. The instructors come out and

1082
01:08:18,605 --> 01:08:22,565
Speaker 12:  they are like clapping people's hands in the audience and like they're,

1083
01:08:22,705 --> 01:08:26,405
Speaker 12:  you know, and I'm just like, I don't know who most of these people are,

1084
01:08:26,505 --> 01:08:30,085
Speaker 12:  but every single time I've gone to a Peloton event, they have brought out

1085
01:08:30,145 --> 01:08:34,085
Speaker 12:  an instructor and the instructor is there and they have actually

1086
01:08:34,745 --> 01:08:38,005
Speaker 12:  put a big hand into how this Peloton IQ has been

1087
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:42,365
Speaker 12:  crafted. So, you know, I had my demo and my demo was with Tunde who

1088
01:08:42,365 --> 01:08:46,205
Speaker 12:  is a cycling instructor I believe. And she was just like, it's

1089
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:50,005
Speaker 12:  like it's my assistant. The AI is my assistant. I have helped

1090
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:54,285
Speaker 12:  craft these recommendations. We have

1091
01:08:54,305 --> 01:08:58,045
Speaker 12:  had a huge say in like what it tells you so

1092
01:08:58,145 --> 01:09:00,925
Speaker 12:  you know, you're gonna listen to me, you're coming from me and this is just

1093
01:09:00,925 --> 01:09:04,085
Speaker 12:  gonna help you out. It's gonna be my little helper. It's like a, she's like,

1094
01:09:04,145 --> 01:09:07,565
Speaker 12:  I'm the professor and this is my teaching assistant. And I was like, that's

1095
01:09:07,565 --> 01:09:11,525
Speaker 12:  a very interesting distinction that they're making there. And I think

1096
01:09:11,525 --> 01:09:14,685
Speaker 12:  that could work because if they're messaging that correctly,

1097
01:09:16,545 --> 01:09:20,205
Speaker 12:  you know, I think the diehards will be like, oh yeah, Tene is my professor

1098
01:09:20,205 --> 01:09:24,005
Speaker 12:  and this is my teaching assistant at Right. Love you Peloton iq. But we'll,

1099
01:09:24,005 --> 01:09:26,685
Speaker 12:  we'll have to see. I'm, I'm in, I'm in the communities, I do be lurking

1100
01:09:27,305 --> 01:09:31,125
Speaker 12:  and some of them are like, AI slop get this shit

1101
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:34,965
Speaker 12:  outta here. So, you know, we'll see how it shakes out over

1102
01:09:35,035 --> 01:09:38,885
Speaker 12:  time. I think they kind of stepped in it by not having an

1103
01:09:38,885 --> 01:09:42,565
Speaker 12:  upgrade program for those people because you know, if you're a really

1104
01:09:42,565 --> 01:09:46,245
Speaker 12:  loyal diehard, you wanna be rewarded for that loyalty. So I think some of

1105
01:09:46,245 --> 01:09:50,205
Speaker 12:  them feel a little betrayed by that to be honest, but

1106
01:09:50,205 --> 01:09:54,125
Speaker 12:  we'll see. We'll see how it goes. Sure. I I remain an AI

1107
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:57,845
Speaker 12:  and fitness hater and skeptic until proven otherwise.

1108
01:09:57,845 --> 01:10:01,245
Speaker 1:  It's gonna be again, like if, if anybody gets it, I think there's a solid

1109
01:10:01,245 --> 01:10:05,085
Speaker 1:  chance that it's Peloton. But also everything you just said about the relationship

1110
01:10:05,085 --> 01:10:08,365
Speaker 1:  between person and AI is the thing every company says

1111
01:10:09,065 --> 01:10:12,445
Speaker 1:  six months before being like, we've created a new AI instructor,

1112
01:10:13,025 --> 01:10:16,845
Speaker 1:  her name is Kim and she is the only instructor on the platform

1113
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:20,685
Speaker 1:  forever. And everything just immediately goes to help.

1114
01:10:20,685 --> 01:10:24,605
Speaker 1:  Right? Like you, you can just see the path towards here is a new con

1115
01:10:24,685 --> 01:10:28,085
Speaker 1:  here as a new instructor, this is the future of Peloton.

1116
01:10:28,675 --> 01:10:32,445
Speaker 1:  It's blobby. It's like, I actually think you missed it's Peloton. Yeah,

1117
01:10:32,715 --> 01:10:36,645
Speaker 12:  It's bl bbo which is my name for all ai. Yeah. Friends

1118
01:10:36,705 --> 01:10:38,925
Speaker 12:  and companions and whatever. It's, But it,

1119
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:42,845
Speaker 1:  But if they can not do that and actually make this thing like a tool and

1120
01:10:42,845 --> 01:10:45,525
Speaker 1:  not a character, I think there's something really powerful there.

1121
01:10:46,315 --> 01:10:50,245
Speaker 12:  Yeah. It's just, are the insights good? That's gonna

1122
01:10:50,245 --> 01:10:52,685
Speaker 12:  be the number one, that is the question. That's the number one question.

1123
01:10:52,785 --> 01:10:56,405
Speaker 12:  If they can't nail that, I'm just gonna add it to my AI fitness

1124
01:10:56,635 --> 01:10:57,885
Speaker 12:  wall of shame. So if

1125
01:10:57,885 --> 01:11:01,725
Speaker 1:  You need somebody to really earnestly be bad at exercise, I'm here for

1126
01:11:01,885 --> 01:11:03,925
Speaker 1:  you. So just lemme know I got your

1127
01:11:03,925 --> 01:11:07,805
Speaker 12:  Back. I can't test five of these equipment. My house is not big enough

1128
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,645

1163
01:13:08,325 --> 01:13:11,125
Speaker 1:  question for the Vergecast Hotline. We get lots of them that are like specifically

Speaker 1:  in the near future. So send us all of your questions for now. The

1169
01:13:29,895 --> 01:13:31,125
Speaker 1:  let's get at it. This one's for you.

1170
01:13:31,905 --> 01:13:35,565
Speaker 16:  Hi Vergecast crew, this is Power Lister and

1171
01:13:36,165 --> 01:13:40,125
Speaker 16:  a new runner. This is a question probably best answered by V

1172
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:43,765
Speaker 16:  Song. For the longest time I've been using my Apple Watch in

1173
01:13:43,765 --> 01:13:47,565
Speaker 16:  combination with the strong app to track my lifts. I've been a power lifter

1174
01:13:47,565 --> 01:13:51,365
Speaker 16:  for many years and would focus on big compound lifts with some accessories.

1175
01:13:52,165 --> 01:13:55,885
Speaker 16:  Recently I've picked up running and mostly track it with Strava. A lot of

1176
01:13:55,885 --> 01:13:59,005
Speaker 16:  my running friends have repeatedly told me to get a Garmin for the better

1177
01:13:59,005 --> 01:14:02,605
Speaker 16:  battery life and overall better smart tracking for running.

1178
01:14:03,155 --> 01:14:06,965
Speaker 16:  I've been using an Apple Watch series six since release and replaced the

1179
01:14:06,965 --> 01:14:10,845
Speaker 16:  battery last year and it's already draining fast. My dilemma is I've

1180
01:14:10,845 --> 01:14:14,605
Speaker 16:  adopted a hybrid plan that incorporates running with my main traditional

1181
01:14:14,845 --> 01:14:18,725
Speaker 16:  strength training lifts that I track with the strong app. And nothing online

1182
01:14:18,775 --> 01:14:22,605
Speaker 16:  shows that that app is compatible with Garmin watches. I was

1183
01:14:22,605 --> 01:14:26,565
Speaker 16:  wondering if you had any advice on maybe potentially repping two smart

1184
01:14:26,565 --> 01:14:30,525
Speaker 16:  watches, one for lifts and one for runs or if I should just

1185
01:14:30,525 --> 01:14:34,365
Speaker 16:  commit to one if so, which appreciate any

1186
01:14:34,365 --> 01:14:37,005
Speaker 16:  help and rock on

1187
01:14:37,565 --> 01:14:40,485
Speaker 1:  V You can see why I picked this for you, right? Like our caller didn't give

1188
01:14:40,485 --> 01:14:43,365
Speaker 1:  their name, but if ever there is someone who feels our caller's pan, it's

1189
01:14:43,365 --> 01:14:44,285
Speaker 1:  it's you. Yeah.

1190
01:14:44,505 --> 01:14:46,485
Speaker 12:  Wow. Welcome to my world caller

1191
01:14:48,355 --> 01:14:52,165
Speaker 12:  because, 'cause I've lived both of those lives. What I will say is that

1192
01:14:52,165 --> 01:14:55,005
Speaker 12:  the double wristing life is difficult because

1193
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:59,805
Speaker 12:  so, so the crux of the problem here is the fact

1194
01:14:59,805 --> 01:15:03,445
Speaker 12:  that fitness data is messy, right? Lots of people use

1195
01:15:03,505 --> 01:15:07,205
Speaker 12:  Strava because it is a def facto hub where you can

1196
01:15:07,205 --> 01:15:10,565
Speaker 12:  import your data from disparate devices and it lives in one place

1197
01:15:10,995 --> 01:15:11,485
Speaker 12:  because

1198
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:17,075
Speaker 12:  that's just how it goes. It integrates with everything everyone

1199
01:15:17,225 --> 01:15:21,085
Speaker 12:  uses. Strava love it. So bad news,

1200
01:15:21,585 --> 01:15:24,365
Speaker 12:  Strava sued garment last week, so Oh no.

1201
01:15:25,985 --> 01:15:29,645
Speaker 12:  And is asking Garmin to stop selling all of its devices.

1202
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:33,765
Speaker 12:  So there's beef between these two companies As a

1203
01:15:33,765 --> 01:15:37,685
Speaker 12:  new runner, what I'm gonna say is that Garmin, I

1204
01:15:37,685 --> 01:15:41,365
Speaker 12:  love Garmin. Garmin, Garmin fans are really die hard, so don't comfort me.

1205
01:15:42,465 --> 01:15:46,365
Speaker 12:  Garmin is overwhelming in terms of the running data for a beginner

1206
01:15:46,555 --> 01:15:50,285
Speaker 12:  because when you are a beginner and you are just running for the first time,

1207
01:15:50,475 --> 01:15:52,685
Speaker 12:  it's about good form. It's about

1208
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:57,955
Speaker 12:  just kind of increasing your time on the road, doing it safely,

1209
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:01,715
Speaker 12:  making sure you're cross training and all of that sort of stuff and just

1210
01:16:01,715 --> 01:16:04,715
Speaker 12:  really kind of finding your rhythm for, for running

1211
01:16:05,535 --> 01:16:09,475
Speaker 12:  and you know, is vertical oscillation data

1212
01:16:09,475 --> 01:16:12,515
Speaker 12:  gonna help you do that or is it gonna confe like confuse you further?

1213
01:16:13,455 --> 01:16:17,435
Speaker 12:  That's, that's what I would say. I do enjoy Garmin. I think

1214
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:22,445
Speaker 12:  it, it's, it's very complicated to kind of get into the

1215
01:16:22,445 --> 01:16:25,965
Speaker 12:  Garmin in depth data. It's not knocking them at all.

1216
01:16:26,445 --> 01:16:30,365
Speaker 12:  I find it very useful, but Apple has made some updates that are for

1217
01:16:30,685 --> 01:16:34,365
Speaker 12:  beginners I think are pretty compelling. Like they've added training load,

1218
01:16:34,425 --> 01:16:38,165
Speaker 12:  so it kind of helps you visualize whether you're doing too much

1219
01:16:38,505 --> 01:16:40,365
Speaker 12:  or how, how your levels are doing.

1220
01:16:41,945 --> 01:16:45,405
Speaker 12:  So what I would say is since you're a beginner, just find out if you like

1221
01:16:45,405 --> 01:16:49,125
Speaker 12:  running first and if you really love running, eventually you will

1222
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:52,845
Speaker 12:  naturally gravitate towards the Garmin just because the

1223
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:55,805
Speaker 12:  features there really are catered towards runners.

1224
01:16:56,835 --> 01:17:00,685
Speaker 12:  They're really great. I, you know, if, if it were up to me

1225
01:17:00,685 --> 01:17:04,445
Speaker 12:  And I was just using a watch for running, I would pick a

1226
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:08,405
Speaker 12:  Garmin, I would probably pick one of the foreign runner garments because

1227
01:17:08,405 --> 01:17:12,235
Speaker 12:  they're not gigantic and they fit well and

1228
01:17:12,235 --> 01:17:15,395
Speaker 12:  they're like really suited towards that. But

1229
01:17:16,225 --> 01:17:18,955
Speaker 12:  just like, hold hold for a second because

1230
01:17:20,025 --> 01:17:23,685
Speaker 12:  that's a lot of gear that we're talking about you having in one Yeah, one

1231
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:26,485
Speaker 12:  space. And as much as possible, I do recommend

1232
01:17:27,805 --> 01:17:31,485
Speaker 12:  streamlining your data streams just because look, I'm, I'm psycho. I have

1233
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:35,085
Speaker 12:  this notebook and this notebook literally is where I log

1234
01:17:35,345 --> 01:17:39,005
Speaker 12:  all of my disparate fitness data and baselines because

1235
01:17:39,245 --> 01:17:42,925
Speaker 12:  I have not found a good digital way of doing it for testing. I, I,

1236
01:17:43,405 --> 01:17:47,245
Speaker 12:  I spend like 40 minutes after each workout just comparing data points.

1237
01:17:47,315 --> 01:17:51,125
Speaker 12:  Like you don't wanna be me and doing that. So

1238
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:55,325
Speaker 12:  like, this is reviewer problems though because I am testing multiple products.

1239
01:17:55,325 --> 01:17:58,885
Speaker 12:  Yes, I do have to live this multiple life. And so why would you, why would

1240
01:17:58,885 --> 01:18:02,685
Speaker 12:  you do this to yourself friend? If you are gonna go the Garmin

1241
01:18:02,685 --> 01:18:05,565
Speaker 12:  route, you can track reps and

1242
01:18:06,205 --> 01:18:09,965
Speaker 12:  workouts within Garmin. Is it gonna be

1243
01:18:10,305 --> 01:18:14,205
Speaker 12:  as good as strong? I'm not sure because you know,

1244
01:18:14,205 --> 01:18:17,965
Speaker 12:  all of my power lifter friends are very into strong and that

1245
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:21,725
Speaker 12:  app, so you are running into the problem of how you know

1246
01:18:22,315 --> 01:18:26,045
Speaker 12:  much like the smart home, there's all these different silos of of data

1247
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:30,405
Speaker 12:  that people have. The main thing is to find what works best for

1248
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:34,125
Speaker 12:  you that you will stick with. If strong is something that you really love

1249
01:18:34,385 --> 01:18:38,005
Speaker 12:  and has really helped you in your power lifting life, don't

1250
01:18:38,135 --> 01:18:40,965
Speaker 12:  ditch it Just because you're running friends are saying that you should

1251
01:18:41,145 --> 01:18:42,285
Speaker 12:  go into Garmin.

1252
01:18:44,405 --> 01:18:48,365
Speaker 12:  I personally do not like the Garmin strength training tracking

1253
01:18:48,365 --> 01:18:52,245
Speaker 12:  because it does not give me enough time to edit my, my, my

1254
01:18:52,245 --> 01:18:55,165
Speaker 12:  weights and my reps and it, I like it throws me out. Mm

1255
01:18:55,165 --> 01:18:56,965
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it sounds like our color didn't like it either. Yeah,

1256
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:59,725
Speaker 12:  I don't, I don't love it. I'll be quite frank about that.

1257
01:19:01,145 --> 01:19:05,125
Speaker 12:  So if, if you find that you love strong on the Apple watch, I don't

1258
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:08,365
Speaker 12:  know, maybe you upgrade to an ultra and see how that does for you. This

1259
01:19:08,365 --> 01:19:11,125
Speaker 1:  Is what I was just about to say. Why is the watch ultra not the perfect,

1260
01:19:11,355 --> 01:19:14,525
Speaker 1:  like jack of all trades version of the answer here?

1261
01:19:14,675 --> 01:19:18,365
Speaker 12:  Okay, so you know the outdoor running crowd and garment and they have a

1262
01:19:18,365 --> 01:19:22,045
Speaker 12:  lot of really valid points here is battery life.

1263
01:19:22,565 --> 01:19:26,325
Speaker 12:  A Garmin is measured in weeks, it's measured in months.

1264
01:19:27,145 --> 01:19:30,485
Speaker 12:  The, I have the ultra three here, I'm still reviewing it. That'll be out

1265
01:19:30,485 --> 01:19:33,765
Speaker 12:  soon, but you know, I've got 72 hours out of it, which is great.

1266
01:19:34,385 --> 01:19:38,165
Speaker 12:  Not if you are running lots of marathons,

1267
01:19:38,205 --> 01:19:41,285
Speaker 12:  doing a lot of hikes, doing a lot of cross training. Sure. It's still a

1268
01:19:41,285 --> 01:19:44,525
Speaker 12:  lot of charging management that you have to do and that's, that's not for

1269
01:19:44,525 --> 01:19:46,165
Speaker 12:  the garment crowd, that that's not what they want.

1270
01:19:47,895 --> 01:19:51,525
Speaker 12:  There are certain like metrics that I think the longer you go into

1271
01:19:51,525 --> 01:19:55,165
Speaker 12:  endurance sports, it's the longer you are in outdoor sports. They are useful.

1272
01:19:55,365 --> 01:19:58,325
Speaker 12:  I like the hill endurance, the hill endurance score. When I was training

1273
01:19:58,325 --> 01:20:02,245
Speaker 12:  for a half marathon, I found, I think it's called the endurance score.

1274
01:20:02,265 --> 01:20:06,165
Speaker 12:  It just basically tracks like how tired you are throughout a run and

1275
01:20:06,165 --> 01:20:08,685
Speaker 12:  whether you're exerting a certain amount of energy. I did find that helpful.

1276
01:20:09,185 --> 01:20:12,885
Speaker 12:  It, it did kind of visualize for me whether or not

1277
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:16,925
Speaker 12:  I was gonna make it to the end of my first half marathon. I did, it was

1278
01:20:16,925 --> 01:20:20,645
Speaker 12:  great. It was not, I suffered immensely, but you know, I,

1279
01:20:20,805 --> 01:20:24,565
Speaker 12:  I trained for my half marathons with garments And I found some of the

1280
01:20:24,565 --> 01:20:28,005
Speaker 12:  more in depth metrics at that point in time once I learned how to read them.

1281
01:20:28,005 --> 01:20:31,445
Speaker 12:  Because you do have to sit there and you do have to like digest that

1282
01:20:31,445 --> 01:20:32,045
Speaker 12:  information.

1283
01:20:33,765 --> 01:20:37,525
Speaker 12:  I did find it helpful for me, But that was when I had kind of gotten to

1284
01:20:37,525 --> 01:20:40,645
Speaker 12:  a level where I was running half marathons and we're talking about thinking

1285
01:20:40,645 --> 01:20:44,605
Speaker 12:  about fueling and what those, you can get fueling reminders on

1286
01:20:44,605 --> 01:20:48,045
Speaker 12:  your garin, you know, like when you're at that level that can be really

1287
01:20:48,185 --> 01:20:51,885
Speaker 12:  useful and helpful and it helps you pair down what you're using. There's

1288
01:20:51,885 --> 01:20:55,285
Speaker 12:  a reason why so many high level runners use

1289
01:20:55,435 --> 01:20:59,165
Speaker 12:  Garmins, but if powerlifting

1290
01:20:59,225 --> 01:21:03,085
Speaker 12:  is your main focus and running is cross training for you,

1291
01:21:03,785 --> 01:21:04,925
Speaker 12:  do what your main

1292
01:21:06,845 --> 01:21:10,485
Speaker 12:  modality of exercise do prioritize that

1293
01:21:10,485 --> 01:21:14,285
Speaker 12:  because Right, the Apple watch, it's decent at run running for a casual

1294
01:21:14,525 --> 01:21:17,925
Speaker 12:  runner. Like if you are just doing 10 Ks or less,

1295
01:21:18,305 --> 01:21:22,285
Speaker 12:  you don't really need, you don't need everything that a Garmin is

1296
01:21:22,285 --> 01:21:26,085
Speaker 12:  gonna give you. Okay. If you are a through hiker, if you, if you decide

1297
01:21:26,085 --> 01:21:29,965
Speaker 12:  that you are gonna make like Liz Lipato and Ruck and, and do

1298
01:21:29,965 --> 01:21:33,645
Speaker 12:  all that sort of stuff. Yeah, no, Garmin makes way more sense for you. It's

1299
01:21:33,645 --> 01:21:37,285
Speaker 12:  just, yeah, do don't live the double

1300
01:21:37,495 --> 01:21:41,045
Speaker 12:  wrist life. It's expensive. You get double watch tans.

1301
01:21:41,485 --> 01:21:45,285
Speaker 12:  I do it because I'm paid to do this. I don't think you should do, I don't

1302
01:21:45,285 --> 01:21:48,765
Speaker 12:  think any normal person should live this life. I may be biased saying that,

1303
01:21:48,865 --> 01:21:49,205
Speaker 12:  But it

1304
01:21:49,205 --> 01:21:53,165
Speaker 1:  Does sound like largely unfortunately as a function of the way that

1305
01:21:53,165 --> 01:21:56,565
Speaker 1:  these devices platforms work, if this person is going to

1306
01:21:56,985 --> 01:22:00,805
Speaker 1:  get into running at the same level, it sounds like they're currently into

1307
01:22:00,805 --> 01:22:03,805
Speaker 1:  power lifting. They, they are going to end up with two devices that like,

1308
01:22:03,805 --> 01:22:07,685
Speaker 1:  I I think your advice to like do the casual thing on the Apple watch

1309
01:22:07,685 --> 01:22:11,645
Speaker 1:  as long as you can is really good advice. But it does sound like if if

1310
01:22:11,645 --> 01:22:15,125
Speaker 1:  you're gonna get to like, you know, a nine or 10 out of 10 on the commitment

1311
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:17,045
Speaker 1:  scale, you're gonna end up with two devices.

1312
01:22:17,185 --> 01:22:20,525
Speaker 12:  You're gonna end up living my life, in which case welcome friend and also,

1313
01:22:20,825 --> 01:22:21,285
Speaker 12:  I'm sorry,

1314
01:22:23,025 --> 01:22:26,845
Speaker 12:  but yeah, stay, stay on a single device as long as you possibly can

1315
01:22:26,845 --> 01:22:30,445
Speaker 12:  because managing the data streams becomes a second full-time

1316
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:31,245
Speaker 12:  unpaid job.

1317
01:22:31,715 --> 01:22:34,205
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I think that's good advice. And then After that, then you get a smart

1318
01:22:34,205 --> 01:22:38,125
Speaker 1:  ring and then you start wearing stuff around your neck and then you come

1319
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:40,445
Speaker 1:  work at The Verge. I think it's like literally that's essentially, there's

1320
01:22:40,445 --> 01:22:43,285
Speaker 1:  just a certain number of devices that happens and then Eli shows up at your

1321
01:22:43,285 --> 01:22:45,085
Speaker 1:  house and offers you a job, I think is like basically

1322
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:49,005
Speaker 12:  How it works. Yeah. That, that's honestly my career trajectory. I was, that's

1323
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:52,805
Speaker 12:  what happened. I was just living my, my life as a fricking cyborg

1324
01:22:52,865 --> 01:22:55,965
Speaker 12:  and then I got a knock on the door and The Verge was like, Hey, we need

1325
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:59,165
Speaker 12:  a wearables person. And I was like, Yolo, let's go.

1326
01:22:59,525 --> 01:23:00,485
Speaker 1:  I have all of them. Let's

1327
01:23:00,485 --> 01:23:04,045
Speaker 12:  Do this. And now look at me. Now look at me. Live your dream. Do you wanna

1328
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:07,845
Speaker 12:  be like me? Call her? No. No, you don't. I

1329
01:23:07,845 --> 01:23:11,805
Speaker 12:  only have one face and so many smart classes that need to, yeah,

1330
01:23:12,535 --> 01:23:16,225
Speaker 1:  Yeah. This is what we do here. It's, it's, no one should live our pain, but

1331
01:23:16,225 --> 01:23:18,345
Speaker 1:  too many people are forced to is I think we, what

1332
01:23:18,345 --> 01:23:21,265
Speaker 12:  We're, I mean like is this, is this optimal? I don't think so.

1333
01:23:22,005 --> 01:23:25,745
Speaker 1:  All right. If you're wearing more gadgets than ve send us an email.

1334
01:23:26,025 --> 01:23:29,185
Speaker 1:  I want, I want pictures of people who are wearing more gadgets than ve.

1335
01:23:29,315 --> 01:23:33,265
Speaker 12:  These aren't all the ones I even wear. Some are embargoed and some

1336
01:23:33,265 --> 01:23:36,945
Speaker 12:  are on parts of the body that, you know, that's not gonna fit in this camera

1337
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:39,185
Speaker 12:  view. Don't live my life.

1338
01:23:40,045 --> 01:23:43,065
Speaker 1:  That's good advice. All right, ve thank you as always. We'll see you next
