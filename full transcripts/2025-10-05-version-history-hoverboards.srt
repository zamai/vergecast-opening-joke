Description: In 2015, self-balancing scooters (which quickly became known as hoverboards) exploded in popularity, and then began literally exploding. Andrew Hawkins and Sean O’Kane join David Pierce to explore the multiple conflicting origin stories behind the hugely popular rideable, the many knockoffs, and why a device that doesn't actually hover ended up being called "hoverboard."

2
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:54,825
Speaker 1:  So old school, right? It's like if you want to go across the office or

3
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:58,865
Speaker 1:  down the street or to the other side of the building, you have to

4
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:02,745
Speaker 1:  use your feet like it's the Middle Ages. It's so, it's who has the

5
00:01:02,745 --> 00:01:06,145
Speaker 1:  time, you know what I mean? Well, I have a better way. They're Hoverboards.

6
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:09,985
Speaker 1:  They're those two wield self-balancing scooters, and they are

7
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:14,105
Speaker 1:  all the rage from The Verge and Vox Media. This is Version History, a

8
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:17,865
Speaker 1:  show about the best and worst and strangest and most

9
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:21,585
Speaker 1:  important products in the history of technology. I'm David Pierce,

10
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:25,585
Speaker 1:  and today we are going for a ride, a definitely

11
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:28,305
Speaker 1:  dangerous and potentially explosive ride.

12
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:51,335
Speaker 1:  O Cain is here. Yeah, band is back together. This is exciting. This is very

13
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:55,095
Speaker 1:  exciting. First, let's just talk about relative

14
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:58,855
Speaker 1:  hoverboard expertise. Andy, you have a confession to make, I believe

15
00:02:58,985 --> 00:02:59,605
Speaker 1:  is how should

16
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:02,725
Speaker 5:  Start. Yes. I I, this is very shameful for me to admit, but I have never

17
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:04,405
Speaker 5:  actually ridden on a hoverboard

18
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:06,405
Speaker 1:  At some point. That's a choice. You made

19
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:10,045
Speaker 5:  It, it was 'cause we had one in the office. Yeah, it was, it was always there.

20
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:13,885
Speaker 5:  O other, you know, co coworkers were, were blasting around.

21
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:18,725
Speaker 5:  I was writing about it very frequently, and yet I still have not

22
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:22,125
Speaker 5:  put my dainty little feet on the platform. So,

23
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:24,125
Speaker 1:  You know. Any, any regrets?

24
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:25,605
Speaker 5:  No. None. None at all. It's late

25
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:26,245
Speaker 1:  Now for sure.

26
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:30,525
Speaker 5:  Zero regrets about that. I, I, I actually, I, I feel

27
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:33,965
Speaker 5:  better about it today. Every day that goes by, I feel even better about the

28
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:34,205
Speaker 5:  decision.

29
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:37,085
Speaker 6:  Think of how much more complicated your commute to bring your kids to school

30
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:39,645
Speaker 6:  could have been if you had stuck with the hoverboard.

31
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:40,125
Speaker 5:  That's

32
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,925
Speaker 1:  Right. My first ever hoverboard experience, I first, I will never forget

33
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:47,685
Speaker 1:  this moment. I got it on Amazon, took it outta the box, And I was in

34
00:03:47,715 --> 00:03:51,645
Speaker 1:  Oakland in my apartment, And I was like, okay, my, my living room is tiny.

35
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:53,845
Speaker 1:  I was in like an 800 square foot apartment. I was like, I don't have any

36
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:55,525
Speaker 1:  room to ride this thing. I'm gonna take it down to the street.

37
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,565
Speaker 5:  First mistake right there. I

38
00:03:57,565 --> 00:04:00,325
Speaker 1:  Was like very early in the hoverboard world at this point. And so I was like,

39
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:02,485
Speaker 1:  I didn't know how any of this worked. So I take it down to the sidewalk.

40
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:06,885
Speaker 1:  I went, I don't know, 18 inches into like the

41
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:10,405
Speaker 1:  line between two of the blocks on the sidewalk and just absolutely launched

42
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:14,165
Speaker 1:  myself into traffic like, like in the middle of the road,

43
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,525
Speaker 1:  eight seconds after getting a hoverboard. And then I was like, all right,

44
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:18,445
Speaker 1:  I'm in it now.

45
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:20,565
Speaker 5:  So we're, we're very lucky to still have you here with us.

46
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:22,925
Speaker 1:  It's, it's a small miracle. Sean, what about you

47
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:27,885
Speaker 6:  Have ridden have not stuck with it. Okay. I expertise would be

48
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:29,085
Speaker 6:  a, a word I wouldn't use.

49
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:33,285
Speaker 1:  Like would you, would peak Sean on a hoverboard. Would you roll

50
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:37,005
Speaker 1:  around this set? Oh no. And not feel, and feel comfortable not destroying

51
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:37,085
Speaker 1:  things

52
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:40,885
Speaker 6:  Without breaking all of the cameras? No. Okay. No. Okay.

53
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:44,725
Speaker 6:  Gimme a wide open space. You know, put me on an airport runway. Oh yeah.

54
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:45,685
Speaker 6:  I could probably cruise a

55
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,405
Speaker 5:  Gymnasium. A

56
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:49,925
Speaker 6:  Recently paved airport runway. I could probably cruise pretty well. Okay.

57
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:52,805
Speaker 1:  That's a, I mean, that comes for something. Yeah. So what I'm hearing is

58
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:56,045
Speaker 1:  I'm the best at Hoverboards. This is a great way to start, but we all covered

59
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:59,845
Speaker 1:  this pretty aggressively. I was at Wired at the time. You two were both

60
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:03,685
Speaker 1:  at The Verge during like the entirety of the hoverboard craze. You were both

61
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:07,565
Speaker 1:  like covering it a lot is my memory of it, right? Like it was, it was

62
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:11,325
Speaker 1:  a huge story in a way that is I think very easy to forget now 10 years

63
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:14,885
Speaker 6:  Later. There are so many parts to the story that I hadn't remembered until

64
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:18,405
Speaker 6:  I was looking back. Like, it's not just about the product, it was about what

65
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:21,165
Speaker 6:  we called it. It was about who was riding it. It was about this

66
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:25,805
Speaker 6:  celebrity craze of all of them probably getting paid to ride them

67
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:29,925
Speaker 6:  or just like thinking they were cool and there were all the, I mean, it

68
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:33,805
Speaker 6:  was just, there was, to me it's also like a harbinger of what was to

69
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:36,845
Speaker 6:  come with sort of the trade war stuff that we've been in over the last couple

70
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:40,445
Speaker 6:  years of sort of rapid production and, and domestic

71
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:44,245
Speaker 6:  manufacturing in China. And it's, it was a deeper story than I

72
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:44,565
Speaker 6:  remembered

73
00:05:44,865 --> 00:05:48,045
Speaker 5:  All the safety implications. Yeah. That was sort of where I came into the

74
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:51,725
Speaker 5:  story was once like they started exploding and catching on fire

75
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:56,125
Speaker 5:  was when I was like, oh, this is, you know, more than just your average like

76
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,445
Speaker 5:  cheap product out of China that people are really into. It's, there's something

77
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:00,205
Speaker 5:  else going on here.

78
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:03,965
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I think this was also, I had forgotten kind of the beginning

79
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:08,525
Speaker 1:  of the like last mile craze. Yes. Where everyone was obsessed

80
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:11,525
Speaker 1:  with this idea that like, oh yeah, what we're gonna do is not just have Hoverboards,

81
00:06:11,525 --> 00:06:15,285
Speaker 1:  but we're gonna reinvent the way that you move small distances.

82
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:18,845
Speaker 1:  Which seems insane to think about now, but I was like, I was all in on this

83
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,605
Speaker 1:  idea at the time and there were like, we were doing weird electric

84
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:26,805
Speaker 1:  skates. There were a bunch of different skateboard ideas. You ended up

85
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:30,765
Speaker 1:  covering boosted board for a like forever after this. All of that,

86
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:35,405
Speaker 1:  maybe not starts with this, but kind of starts with this. This was like the

87
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:38,765
Speaker 1:  beginning of the idea of like, what weird stuff can I put under my feet that

88
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,325
Speaker 1:  are gonna make it fun to move around the office, warehouse, neighborhood,

89
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:46,405
Speaker 1:  what have you and weird times. Yeah. I still have a bunch of those

90
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:46,885
Speaker 1:  things at my house.

91
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:50,205
Speaker 6:  It was, I mean, it was a more optimistic time, right? We were watching Google's

92
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:54,005
Speaker 6:  little sort of cutesy autonomous vehicle for the first time,

93
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:58,285
Speaker 6:  navigate some streets. We were thinking about electric aircraft and all this

94
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:02,005
Speaker 6:  stuff. Everything was in the concept phase. And so these became

95
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,205
Speaker 6:  sort of the first tangible things of like, this is what the future will be

96
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,765
Speaker 6:  like and as far as how you're gonna move around. And I think that was one

97
00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:11,125
Speaker 6:  of the reasons that fueled all that stuff. And it was also, I honestly, I

98
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:14,965
Speaker 6:  think there's a, an element of the Tesla piece here where

99
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:19,405
Speaker 6:  there was all this talk at the time about the rapid

100
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:23,445
Speaker 6:  acceleration of development of electric motors, of battery technology,

101
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:27,725
Speaker 6:  the miniaturization of that, the lowering of the cost. It's gonna revolutionize

102
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:31,765
Speaker 6:  the kinds of things you can build because they're no longer cost prohibitive.

103
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:36,525
Speaker 6:  And so it was just, all of that stuff got swept up into what became

104
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:40,445
Speaker 6:  this weird thing, this weird thing that we called the boarding. I

105
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:42,885
Speaker 5:  Think there's also sort of like, there's a germ of like influencer culture

106
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:45,805
Speaker 5:  that like kind of birthed out of this as well. Like we didn't really have,

107
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,045
Speaker 5:  like, there wasn't like profession, like a professional influencer.

108
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. This thing would've done numbers on TikTok shop seriously.

109
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:57,445
Speaker 5:  And like, it was like we needed to have the celebrities be the ones to like

110
00:07:57,445 --> 00:08:01,285
Speaker 5:  introduce us to this weird gadget, right. As opposed to just like

111
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:05,005
Speaker 5:  all of the, the, you know, the eventually what became, you know, like influencers

112
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:07,805
Speaker 5:  as we know them today. So I, I always thought that was really interesting.

113
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:08,325
Speaker 5:  Totally.

114
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:12,245
Speaker 1:  Okay. So this was a weird one because most of the things we talk about on

115
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:15,445
Speaker 1:  the show sort of start in one obvious place.

116
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,565
Speaker 1:  Hoverboards very much do not, let me just sort of lay out the like two

117
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:24,005
Speaker 1:  parallel histories here and we can sort of talk through it. So on one

118
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:27,605
Speaker 1:  parallel history, we have this guy named Shane Chen, who is an inventor,

119
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:32,405
Speaker 1:  lives in the Pacific Northwest, has been into like ridely things

120
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:36,365
Speaker 1:  for forever. And in 2013 he files a

121
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,365
Speaker 1:  patent for a thing called the hover tracks with an X at the end. So, you

122
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:43,045
Speaker 1:  know, it's cool. And he called it a two wheel self-balancing vehicle

123
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,965
Speaker 1:  made with independently movable foot placement sections. And like the thing

124
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:50,445
Speaker 1:  that made it new and not a segue was that it had essentially two

125
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:54,765
Speaker 1:  distinct platforms both attached to a wheel and you could move them independently.

126
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:58,085
Speaker 1:  Right? And so the whole thing was like you, you push them forward and it

127
00:08:58,085 --> 00:09:00,205
Speaker 1:  goes forward. You push them backwards and it goes backwards. You push one

128
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:03,205
Speaker 1:  and pull one and it turns. And so that, that was like his big

129
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:07,685
Speaker 1:  technical change. He set up a Kickstarter

130
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:11,605
Speaker 1:  for this thing he had, he has said since that he had this idiot in 2011 patent

131
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:14,805
Speaker 1:  said in 2013, does the Kickstarter in 2013

132
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:18,485
Speaker 1:  raises like a little over $80,000 from I think it was

133
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,885
Speaker 1:  162 backers on Kickstarter, which is

134
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:26,725
Speaker 1:  fine numbers. Congratulations. Yeah. How you did it, it hit its goal. So

135
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:29,845
Speaker 5:  You, you get in on the ground floor on Hoverboards, like you're living that

136
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:32,485
Speaker 5:  billionaire lifestyle these days. You know, that's what you wanna be, you

137
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:34,045
Speaker 5:  wanna be one of those original seed investors.

138
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:34,565
Speaker 1:  Well,

139
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:40,325
Speaker 1:  well our boy Shane Chen might have different feelings than that. But

140
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:44,165
Speaker 1:  let me just, this is the most like 2013 Kickstarter video ever.

141
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:47,205
Speaker 1:  So let me just play you a short clip from the Kickstarter.

142
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:52,085
Speaker 7:  This is my latest dimension. It's called Hover Tracks

143
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:56,805
Speaker 7:  because it has two wheels. So you can stand still

144
00:09:57,745 --> 00:10:01,485
Speaker 7:  and you put your feet on on here, you lean

145
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:05,125
Speaker 7:  forward, you move forward, lean back, you come back

146
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:09,485
Speaker 7:  and you press one foot forward and one

147
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,645
Speaker 7:  foot back you spin

148
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:16,005
Speaker 7:  or you can make turn when you're moving forward. And

149
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,845
Speaker 7:  this is very convenient and

150
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:20,725
Speaker 7:  very portable.

151
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:24,285
Speaker 1:  I love this because he's like, this is the most, like I invented a thing

152
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:28,205
Speaker 1:  And I have no idea what it's for. Video of all time. Yes. Do you

153
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:29,285
Speaker 1:  wanna back this on Kickstarter?

154
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:30,565
Speaker 5:  Take all my money please.

155
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:33,085
Speaker 1:  Yeah, exactly. So, okay, so all of this is happening.

156
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:38,285
Speaker 1:  Patents, it starts to ship it out. There were some delays because of

157
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:42,045
Speaker 1:  port shenanigans, but like shift a bunch of things to

158
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:44,965
Speaker 1:  actual people in the world and in America

159
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:49,165
Speaker 1:  that's one version of the history. The other version of the history

160
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:53,525
Speaker 1:  starts in China with this company called Chic Robotics, which is one of the

161
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:56,885
Speaker 1:  like big factories in China have a lot of like little tiny house brands.

162
00:10:56,985 --> 00:11:00,725
Speaker 1:  So there's like a million companies inside of this one factory. Chic Robotics

163
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:04,645
Speaker 1:  is one of them. They start making what they call self-balancing

164
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:08,325
Speaker 1:  scooters that look a lot like our buddy Shane's

165
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:12,325
Speaker 1:  hover tracks in August of 2014. And these,

166
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:16,925
Speaker 1:  I did a story about these a million years ago in which I went back and looked

167
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:19,805
Speaker 1:  through, went back when this is a thing you could do every YouTube video

168
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:23,245
Speaker 1:  that had ever been posted about these things all the way back to the beginning.

169
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:27,285
Speaker 1:  And the very first one I ever found was from August, 2014 of a device

170
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:31,085
Speaker 1:  called the Smart S one from Chic Robotics. So

171
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:35,125
Speaker 1:  Chic Robotics makes this device, they take it to the, the largest

172
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,125
Speaker 1:  trade show in China. It's a big hit. One of the stories of these things kind

173
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:43,005
Speaker 1:  of over and over is that one of the ways they grow is by like

174
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:46,525
Speaker 1:  taking a bunch to a convention center somewhere and then just like have people

175
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:50,085
Speaker 1:  ride them around. Sure. And they become this like weird viral phenomenon

176
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:53,405
Speaker 1:  over and over. I think we all had this experience at CES one year. It was

177
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:55,605
Speaker 6:  Just one of those things where they just showed up and it was, you know,

178
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:59,285
Speaker 6:  that was, I think CES is its most fun is when there are people who are sort

179
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:03,165
Speaker 6:  of at the edges and don't, aren't part of the whole machine of sort of setting

180
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:05,725
Speaker 6:  up a schedule and like getting people to meet and they just have a fun idea

181
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,645
Speaker 6:  and they're like, and this thing, you know, to your point about it, catching

182
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,485
Speaker 6:  people's eye in spaces like that, there's something so unsettling about

183
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:17,405
Speaker 6:  seeing the top half of a person moving without bobbing up and

184
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:20,765
Speaker 6:  down. Yes. And I think that like, honestly I think that's a small part, but

185
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:24,045
Speaker 6:  an important part of like why this thing caught so many people's eyes. Because

186
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:27,285
Speaker 6:  if you see someone moving like that, you're like, what is going on? Right.

187
00:12:27,315 --> 00:12:30,325
Speaker 1:  Well and it's like a few inches off the ground. So you're, you're the tallest

188
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,725
Speaker 1:  person in the room all of a sudden and you're just kind of slowly moving

189
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:36,285
Speaker 1:  towards everyone. Like it's, it is deeply like alarming. You're like on a

190
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:40,205
Speaker 1:  dolly almost. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. So Sheik

191
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:43,725
Speaker 1:  makes this thing and their version of this story is

192
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:47,085
Speaker 1:  relatively straightforward. Like Sheik makes a thing, finds a bunch of distributors,

193
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:50,965
Speaker 1:  those distributors put logos and stickers on it and they, you know,

194
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:53,805
Speaker 1:  change the manufacturing a little bit and they start to ship it all over

195
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:57,485
Speaker 1:  the world. Those are the two versions of the story. Shane Chen,

196
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,405
Speaker 1:  who we should point out, was out doing this earlier publicly.

197
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:05,605
Speaker 1:  What he says is that what Sheik did was basically look at his Kickstarter

198
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:09,285
Speaker 1:  page, take the photos and the video and reverse engineer

199
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:12,925
Speaker 1:  their product out of it. This is a thing that is very hard to know.

200
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:17,525
Speaker 1:  It has been litigated endlessly, which will come up over and over

201
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:21,405
Speaker 1:  again throughout this story. But it, it tracks like that. The place

202
00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:25,365
Speaker 1:  that I've landed is like the thing that we have in the United States looks

203
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:29,125
Speaker 1:  more like that one from Chic than it does the one, the

204
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,725
Speaker 1:  hover tracks that Shane Chen made the year before. And then whatever happened,

205
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:36,045
Speaker 1:  everybody else ripped off their intellectual property. Right. So as soon

206
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:39,765
Speaker 1:  as even this stuff comes out and as soon as these things start to get manufactured,

207
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:43,805
Speaker 1:  they are just immediately everywhere. And so, like

208
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,605
Speaker 1:  when they first came to the us, which was pretty quick, they came,

209
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,445
Speaker 1:  my recollection at least is not sort of as, as there was not one product

210
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:55,605
Speaker 1:  that showed up and then a bunch of knockoffs. Right. All it was all knockoffs

211
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:58,085
Speaker 1:  right. From day one. Yeah. Which was just

212
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:01,045
Speaker 5:  Weird. And they all had the weirdest names there. It was, it was always like

213
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:04,245
Speaker 5:  some sort of like bizarre combination of English words that didn't really

214
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:07,965
Speaker 5:  seem like they made sense together. Like car, wind

215
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:08,765
Speaker 5:  wheel,

216
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:13,045
Speaker 6:  Another sort of harbinger of what was to come. I feel like this is a proto

217
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:16,605
Speaker 6:  version of like the alphabet soup. Oh yeah. Like Amazon Best that we have

218
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:20,005
Speaker 6:  today of like, ah, I'm gonna buy an electric toothbrush. This one that's

219
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:23,605
Speaker 6:  called X nine Z two B. Yeah.

220
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:24,525
Speaker 6:  Free looks

221
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:28,005
Speaker 1:  Good. I will say to the Hoverboards credit, one of them was called Funky

222
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:31,925
Speaker 1:  Duck with a pH. Oh yeah. And that's very good. So we did, we, we made a,

223
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:36,005
Speaker 1:  a clip of some of our favorite hoverboard brand names.

224
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:39,805
Speaker 1:  Lemme just tell you this for you. Yeah. This is a swag wing. This

225
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,805
Speaker 8:  Is the Funky Duck. This is Hover Tracks, this is the Epical Classic. This

226
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:47,725
Speaker 8:  is the Mono Rover two Carl Lifestyle iHawk, the Hoverboard

227
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:48,325
Speaker 8:  360.

228
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:52,565
Speaker 9:  This particular model is called the Lee Ray Self-Balancing scooter.

229
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:55,045
Speaker 9:  They also call it the the Dream Walker.

230
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:58,645
Speaker 6:  The Oh Walker. That's ominous. I

231
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:02,085
Speaker 1:  Say a favorite version. My favorite version of this story is,

232
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:06,885
Speaker 1:  I believe it was Funky Duck sent one of their scooters

233
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:11,045
Speaker 1:  to Soulja Boy, which

234
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:14,725
Speaker 1:  is a very 2015 sentence to say out loud. And then,

235
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:19,765
Speaker 1:  and then like, like days later, Soulja Boy starts

236
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:23,365
Speaker 1:  selling. Yeah. A board, I believe it's called the Soulja Board. Yeah. Because

237
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:23,885
Speaker 6:  Why not? It

238
00:15:23,885 --> 00:15:26,605
Speaker 1:  Is literally, and the picture is just him standing on the board That Funky

239
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:29,885
Speaker 1:  Duck sent it. Yeah. Which is just, this is just where we were at the time.

240
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,085
Speaker 1:  I love

241
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:34,845
Speaker 6:  It. Yeah. It was, you know, a Cambrian explosion of the same

242
00:15:34,845 --> 00:15:36,405
Speaker 6:  thing. Just

243
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:40,285
Speaker 5:  The thing that that always amazed me is that none of these things looked

244
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:43,685
Speaker 5:  any different from the next one. Yeah. They all looked almost identical.

245
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:48,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like you put, you line 'em all up together and you would have a difficulty

246
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:51,725
Speaker 5:  like applying brand names to any of them because they just all looked the

247
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:51,885
Speaker 5:  same.

248
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:55,965
Speaker 1:  And what was funny is every one of the companies would hate that

249
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:59,965
Speaker 1:  characterization, right? Because they were all like, oh well a, we have big

250
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:03,125
Speaker 1:  plans for the second one. Get ready for

251
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:06,925
Speaker 6:  As soon as we know what that is and where we're gonna get the idea from.

252
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,445
Speaker 1:  We're gonna do all kinds of stuff on Funky Duck too. Like you're not even

253
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:12,285
Speaker 1:  gonna believe it. But then they would all say, you know, everybody else is

254
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:15,885
Speaker 1:  using shoddy batteries and they're not doing any safety testing and they

255
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:19,405
Speaker 1:  don't care about, but we are the ones doing a good job. And I mean, down

256
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:22,245
Speaker 1:  that line of what you're describing, every single one of them would've said

257
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:25,925
Speaker 1:  that to you. Which is just, which is just delightful. But anyway, so these,

258
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:29,565
Speaker 1:  these companies start suing each other and and

259
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:32,525
Speaker 1:  pointing fingers at each other. You have Funky duck And I hawk both of which

260
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:35,325
Speaker 1:  I guess are distributing chic robotics, which may or may not be knocking

261
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:39,285
Speaker 1:  off the hover tracks. This is, look, I lose my mind trying to

262
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:43,245
Speaker 1:  explain hoverboard the layers of this seriously. And

263
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:47,205
Speaker 1:  so everybody just starts to fight. But meanwhile this thing is everywhere.

264
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:51,005
Speaker 1:  Like my memory of it is essentially overnight all of a sudden, like this

265
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:53,205
Speaker 1:  went from being a thing I had never heard of and never cared about to being

266
00:16:53,205 --> 00:16:55,725
Speaker 1:  like front and center in pop culture

267
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:59,605
Speaker 6:  Because it's also hit right around the same time. I feel like I'm remembering

268
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:03,485
Speaker 6:  correctly that Instagram really became

269
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:06,725
Speaker 6:  a place for celebrities to post. That wasn't the case for a while. I remember

270
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,205
Speaker 6:  it was just sort of like, you know, artful of pictures and filtered whatever

271
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:13,445
Speaker 6:  and your friends, 'cause you were coming, well you weren't coming from Facebook

272
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:17,365
Speaker 6:  but you know, they bought it eventually. But this idea that we were getting

273
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:21,205
Speaker 6:  a glimpse of the sort of polished version of a celebrity's home life

274
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:25,525
Speaker 6:  and all of a sudden into that comes like some of the first product, to your

275
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:29,125
Speaker 6:  point earlier, just like this was sort of like proto influencer

276
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,645
Speaker 6:  marketing, like celebrity influencer marketing where they were getting these

277
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:34,845
Speaker 6:  products and dang in front of her face. I remember other ones being like,

278
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:38,525
Speaker 6:  you know, Lewis Hamilton riding some sort of like electric surfboard. There

279
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,085
Speaker 6:  was a lot of this stuff happening at the time, but this was certainly the

280
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:41,565
Speaker 6:  most viral.

281
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:46,085
Speaker 1:  I went back, I did a really, really unnecessary

282
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:49,965
Speaker 1:  Instagram deep dive to figure out who was the first celebrity to post

283
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,165
Speaker 1:  a hoverboard. Who do you think it was? Oh

284
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:52,405
Speaker 6:  Gosh.

285
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:56,085
Speaker 5:  Paul Giamatti. No, that would

286
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:56,685
Speaker 1:  Be amazing.

287
00:17:58,165 --> 00:17:59,285
Speaker 6:  I yearn for that content

288
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:02,045
Speaker 1:  In his like full John Adams

289
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:03,045
Speaker 6:  Garb.

290
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:06,525
Speaker 5:  Love that. Oh God, I don't know. That's a gree, that's a good one.

291
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:10,765
Speaker 1:  He's very famous. Oh, And I love his music. Unironically.

292
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:11,885
Speaker 6:  John Mayer.

293
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:16,165
Speaker 1:  Justin Bieber. Okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Justin Bieber I

294
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:19,765
Speaker 1:  think historically speaking kind of gets a lot of credit for like

295
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,085
Speaker 1:  single-handedly making Hoverboards a thing. And the more I research it, the

296
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:27,005
Speaker 1:  more I think he's right. But here, let me just play you, this is the

297
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,685
Speaker 1:  very first video I could find. This is from May I believe

298
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:34,565
Speaker 1:  14th of 2015. This is, wow. This is like the,

299
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,885
Speaker 1:  the celebrity birth of Hoverboards

300
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:40,965
Speaker 6:  And

301
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:44,445
Speaker 1:  It's just him spinning around ticking one foot off, which fairly

302
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:44,965
Speaker 1:  advanced.

303
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:48,445
Speaker 6:  I mean, is it him?

304
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:51,405
Speaker 5:  Well look at those pants, look at those shorts and then he falls

305
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:52,885
Speaker 6:  Off. I'm just saying

306
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:57,125
Speaker 1:  The caption in that video is something like I dyed right after this, which

307
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,085
Speaker 1:  is very good. Sure. I

308
00:18:58,195 --> 00:19:01,565
Speaker 5:  Even though we didn't see his face, I know that that was floppy hair era

309
00:19:01,785 --> 00:19:03,565
Speaker 5:  beaver. It had to have been right without question.

310
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:04,165
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

311
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:07,485
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm a truther, I'm not lie

312
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:08,125
Speaker 5:  You don't think

313
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,165
Speaker 6:  It was beeps? No

314
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:14,445
Speaker 1:  Beeps. Body double did a lot of work in 2015 on a hoverboard.

315
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,205
Speaker 6:  It was Giovanni Ani.

316
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:20,525
Speaker 1:  But I love that clip. 'cause a to your point, this was like early Instagram

317
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:24,285
Speaker 1:  video when like no one would be caught dead making that low

318
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:25,285
Speaker 1:  quality Instagram.

319
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:27,165
Speaker 6:  It wasn't even a good V anymore, let alone a good

320
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,525
Speaker 5:  Instagram. There was no music. No,

321
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:32,165
Speaker 1:  It was too long. He spins in a bunch of circles, he falls nothing funny happened.

322
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:36,085
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But that was huge and then it just absolutely took off.

323
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:39,845
Speaker 1:  So like here's just a, a small percentage of the

324
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:43,325
Speaker 1:  list of people, Wiz Khalifa, Nick Jonas

325
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:47,085
Speaker 1:  z Kendall Jenner Jr. R Smith, who, I don't know if you guys remember this,

326
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:51,165
Speaker 1:  if you're a basketball fans rode one in the tunnel to I believe the NBA

327
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:54,445
Speaker 1:  finals. And it was like, it, it was like a, like a national news moment.

328
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:58,405
Speaker 1:  Sure. Millions of people watching JR Smith just like potentially injure

329
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,765
Speaker 1:  himself all the way to the locker room. Nicki Minaj,

330
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:06,365
Speaker 1:  Nina al the model. David Ortiz. Kareem sma, the soccer

331
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:09,085
Speaker 1:  player. Skrillex who he came very well known for his

332
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:09,925
Speaker 5:  Hover boarding. That's the most

333
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:11,685
Speaker 6:  2015. Yeah. We, that should have been my guess.

334
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:13,885
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And then all of the late night hosts.

335
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:14,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

336
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:18,605
Speaker 1:  This was like a staple all of late night 19. All the Jimmy all Jimmys,

337
00:20:18,945 --> 00:20:20,645
Speaker 1:  Jimmys and James' and all of them.

338
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:25,325
Speaker 1:  And so like, this was, this was like a huge thing. And the thing that I had

339
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:29,265
Speaker 1:  forgotten was how short a period of time that actually was.

340
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:33,505
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Because this is basically, so like Beaver posts in March and

341
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:36,945
Speaker 1:  then we spend kind of May, June, July, August,

342
00:20:37,665 --> 00:20:38,865
Speaker 1:  culturally obsessed with Harvard Board.

343
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:39,585
Speaker 5:  Is this 2016?

344
00:20:39,895 --> 00:20:40,625
Speaker 6:  15. 15. 15.

345
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,505
Speaker 1:  Okay. This is literally, this is all, this is, it's this whole story is

346
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:46,145
Speaker 1:  one year long. It's nuts.

347
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:50,165
Speaker 5:  I I also remember like, it was either 2015 or 2016 but like whatever

348
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:54,165
Speaker 5:  year the holidays came around. Yeah. It was

349
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:58,285
Speaker 5:  insane. Yeah. That like every kid was like, I want one of these

350
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:01,685
Speaker 5:  so bad. Sure. Like that's the only thing that I want mom and dad. And it

351
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:05,485
Speaker 5:  was like every like, it was like, you know, rushing to get, you know,

352
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,205
Speaker 5:  wherever you could get one, you know, people fighting over them at Black

353
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:09,725
Speaker 5:  Friday deals like it was, and

354
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:12,485
Speaker 6:  There were absolutely no problems with these things sitting under flammable

355
00:21:12,645 --> 00:21:13,605
Speaker 6:  Christmas trees. None at all.

356
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:14,245
Speaker 5:  None at all.

357
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:18,645
Speaker 1:  What a good segue that is. So all of this happens and then

358
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:23,205
Speaker 1:  what do Hoverboards start doing? They start exploding. Which is where

359
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:26,805
Speaker 1:  Andy comes into the story. Do you, do you remember any of the like early

360
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:28,405
Speaker 1:  versions of this story? I

361
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:32,445
Speaker 5:  Remember being very like, you know, panic, panicked, like this is

362
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:36,325
Speaker 5:  a problem because Yes, they started exploding. They were catching on fire.

363
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:40,405
Speaker 5:  There was some deaths I think associated with it. Like it was, it was bad.

364
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:40,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

365
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:44,765
Speaker 1:  And it's, it's useful to remember that these things are huge. Yeah. Which

366
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:48,685
Speaker 1:  is like, it's not like if your, even your phone battery exploded 'cause this

367
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:50,165
Speaker 1:  is just before

368
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:52,285
Speaker 6:  The, the notes seven the Galaxy note

369
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:54,605
Speaker 1:  Shenanigan. Like Yes. It's really like

370
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:58,605
Speaker 6:  We were actually so prepared for the note seven 'cause of Hoverboards.

371
00:21:58,815 --> 00:21:59,165
Speaker 5:  Right.

372
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:02,925
Speaker 6:  This is actually Hoverboards are, were learning moments for me in multiple

373
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:06,325
Speaker 6:  ways. One was, this is where I first learned what UL certification is. Yes.

374
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:07,125
Speaker 5:  Same important.

375
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:11,165
Speaker 6:  Because we spent a lot of time trying to figure out whether or not post this

376
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:14,845
Speaker 6:  sort of fire stuff starting whether or not each

377
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:17,885
Speaker 6:  individual company had gotten UL certification most of 'em hadn't. And how

378
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:21,845
Speaker 6:  important that can be. And then and you know that was

379
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:23,005
Speaker 6:  just a big that was a big one.

380
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:27,245
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. UL certification is another thing that one

381
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,725
Speaker 1:  of those you're like, why I wish I had never needed to learn about this.

382
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:32,605
Speaker 1:  But here we are. I'm glad it exists And I hope I never think about it again.

383
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:35,165
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Okay. I have a couple of clips I would like to play for you of

384
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:39,605
Speaker 1:  hoverboard explosions because what are we here for? It's not

385
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:41,085
Speaker 1:  hoverboard explosions with the gawk.

386
00:22:42,635 --> 00:22:46,445
Speaker 10:  Hoverboards are red hot in more ways than than one. There has been another

387
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:50,085
Speaker 10:  reported fire involving the popular self-balancing scooters.

388
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:53,965
Speaker 11:  I came down the sidewalk not even probably a hundred feet and it

389
00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:55,605
Speaker 11:  exploded. It said boom.

390
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:58,165
Speaker 5:  But how did they explode? So well simple.

391
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:02,445
Speaker 12:  We take a battery from a 90 cell phone and make a power of motor designed

392
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,165
Speaker 12:  for a small

393
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:07,245
Speaker 13:  Car safety officials saying all the Hoverboards sold in the US my God are

394
00:23:07,245 --> 00:23:08,165
Speaker 13:  unsafe strollers

395
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:13,125
Speaker 14:  Company to continue to sell Hoverboards that they know

396
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:15,365
Speaker 14:  do not comply with the standard.

397
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:19,645
Speaker 15:  And since not a single one has been certified as safe, the consumer product

398
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:23,605
Speaker 15:  safety commission warns consumers risk, serious injury or

399
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:26,965
Speaker 15:  death if they're self-balancing scooters ignite and burn

400
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:31,005
Speaker 5:  Well. And as soon as that came came down like

401
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:34,885
Speaker 5:  everywhere started banning them. Right? Yeah. The MTA

402
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:36,965
Speaker 5:  the all the airlines banned them.

403
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:38,845
Speaker 6:  Walmart. Right. Walmart was like pulling 'em off the shelves, pulling

404
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:42,085
Speaker 5:  'em off the shelves. You couldn't go through TSA security with one if you

405
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:46,045
Speaker 5:  had it. Like it was just sort of like it was a free for all and then nowhere

406
00:23:46,535 --> 00:23:48,605
Speaker 5:  would allowed them to have them anywhere. Yeah, yeah.

407
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:52,325
Speaker 1:  Like almost immediately. Yeah. There were, it just, it turned

408
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:54,765
Speaker 6:  God. Just remember that there were like, they took, you remember at the time

409
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:58,525
Speaker 6:  there were all those MTA sort of helpful hint things on the subway

410
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:02,005
Speaker 6:  with like the sort of simply drawn figure people

411
00:24:02,115 --> 00:24:02,925
Speaker 5:  Like the cartoon people.

412
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:05,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And they had ones for the Hoverboards or it was like, don't bring this

413
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:09,045
Speaker 6:  on board. I think they're still up there probably in some, yes. And I remember

414
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:11,765
Speaker 6:  it would, some of them would be animated on some of the video screens and

415
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:15,685
Speaker 6:  it would be like, you know, big X over like guy trying to bring

416
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:18,565
Speaker 6:  a like little simply drawn hoverboard onto the subway. Like I,

417
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:21,405
Speaker 5:  I lived in the city for like, you know, 20 years And I don't think I ever

418
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:24,445
Speaker 5:  saw anybody. I think I saw, saw some people carrying that, but I've never

419
00:24:24,445 --> 00:24:28,245
Speaker 5:  saw anyone use one on a subway. And I'm just wondering like how the physics

420
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:31,845
Speaker 5:  of that work, if you're going back and the train is going forward, are you

421
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,805
Speaker 5:  just standing still if you're riding the hoverboard? How does that work?

422
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:35,205
Speaker 5:  See

423
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:38,085
Speaker 1:  That I would, I would give somebody a dollar for that on the subway

424
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:40,565
Speaker 1:  show time. Yeah. It's like mariachi band Showtime.

425
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:42,805
Speaker 5:  That's your showtime before. That's showtime. Absolutely.

426
00:24:42,805 --> 00:24:44,965
Speaker 1:  Especially if you can like spin up through the bars with the H.

427
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:48,005
Speaker 5:  We haven't even talked about the ones that have like builtin speakers and

428
00:24:48,005 --> 00:24:48,765
Speaker 5:  lights. Yes.

429
00:24:48,765 --> 00:24:49,325
Speaker 1:  And I like, oh

430
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:49,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I don't wanna get

431
00:24:49,965 --> 00:24:52,645
Speaker 1:  Ahead of ourselves. No, this, this is the right time. 'cause this was like,

432
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:54,605
Speaker 1:  that was the other thing that it was time

433
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:55,645
Speaker 6:  For funky dunk too baby.

434
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:56,245
Speaker 5:  There you go.

435
00:24:56,635 --> 00:25:00,085
Speaker 1:  Well, so there, at this point there were basically one of three things is

436
00:25:00,085 --> 00:25:04,005
Speaker 1:  going to happen. Either this whole thing is gonna die, it's

437
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:07,765
Speaker 1:  gonna get safer and better or it's just gonna get weirder.

438
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:12,045
Speaker 1:  And for a minute it just got weirder. To your point. So people, people started

439
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:15,125
Speaker 1:  moding these things. Companies now that there had been like more time to

440
00:25:15,485 --> 00:25:18,165
Speaker 1:  actually rev the product and ship the stuff and more people were manufacturing

441
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:21,365
Speaker 1:  it. There were all these weird new ideas about stuff you could put in it

442
00:25:22,235 --> 00:25:25,845
Speaker 1:  like speakers, which I remember being just a full nightmare of a

443
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:26,325
Speaker 1:  idea

444
00:25:27,705 --> 00:25:31,445
Speaker 6:  Yet somehow like deeply appropriate. Yes. Like this thing is so gar. I mean

445
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:34,965
Speaker 6:  it already was essentially like a party speaker on wheels. So like making

446
00:25:34,985 --> 00:25:38,805
Speaker 6:  it a party Speaker on Wheels was like Yeah. Yeah. That tracks. Yeah that

447
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:42,565
Speaker 1:  Tracks. Yeah. And there I, I remember seeing like increasingly crazy light

448
00:25:42,615 --> 00:25:46,525
Speaker 1:  shows coming out of the side of them that lasted

449
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:50,005
Speaker 1:  for a minute and then the third thing happened, which is it all fell apart.

450
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:52,485
Speaker 1:  But we need to take a break really quickly and then we're gonna talk about

451
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:55,245
Speaker 1:  what actually happened to Hoverboards. We'll be right back.

452
00:25:59,235 --> 00:26:03,075
Speaker 17:  Rinse takes your laundry and hand delivers it to your door. Expertly

453
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:06,715
Speaker 17:  cleaned and folded so you can take the time. All that time

454
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:10,275
Speaker 17:  once spent on folding and sorting, watching and waiting

455
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:14,675
Speaker 17:  to finally pursue a whole new version of you. Like

456
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:15,955
Speaker 17:  Birdhouse building you.

457
00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:20,235
Speaker 16:  Yeah. The birds are gonna love this.

458
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:22,915
Speaker 17:  Or Dollhouse building you.

459
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:27,995
Speaker 16:  Yeah. The kids are gonna love this.

460
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:32,475
Speaker 17:  Or maybe, how is DJ track building to the base

461
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:33,035
Speaker 17:  drop you.

462
00:26:33,855 --> 00:26:36,635
Speaker 16:  Oh yeah. The kids are gonna love it.

463
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:32,355
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. So end of 2015

464
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:37,685
Speaker 1:  it all kind of goes sideways. Everything's exploding. Like

465
00:27:37,685 --> 00:27:37,965
Speaker 1:  cover

466
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:38,805
Speaker 6:  Board was sideways.

467
00:27:39,105 --> 00:27:43,005
Speaker 1:  Yes. The hoverboard, I fell off the hoverboard metaphorically and literally

468
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:46,645
Speaker 1:  in 2015. But the big thing to your point about

469
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:50,165
Speaker 1:  holidays from before, the big thing that happened was Amazon stopped selling

470
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:54,005
Speaker 1:  all of the Hoverboards like all at once. And, and

471
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,685
Speaker 6:  We all know that's the only way to buy anything these days. I mean kind of.

472
00:27:56,795 --> 00:27:57,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

473
00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:59,805
Speaker 1:  And it was like, it was really interesting 'cause it, I, I went back and

474
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:03,485
Speaker 1:  was looking at the beginning of the story. There was this run of people buying

475
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:07,245
Speaker 1:  them on Alibaba and a lot of like drop shipping stuff happening

476
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:10,925
Speaker 1:  from some of these factories in China. And then all those factories just

477
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:14,365
Speaker 1:  started selling directly on Amazon. And so that became the place

478
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:18,245
Speaker 1:  everybody bought Hoverboards like for a long time. And

479
00:28:18,245 --> 00:28:22,045
Speaker 1:  then Amazon just essentially overnight just stopped selling them. And so

480
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:25,805
Speaker 1:  you just couldn't get them. And this happened like at holiday season so a

481
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:29,645
Speaker 1:  lot of people had them already, but now they are a safety risk that are,

482
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:33,085
Speaker 1:  is being broadcast to everyone as a huge safety risk. You literally can't

483
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:37,045
Speaker 1:  buy one and the whole thing just kind of just poof

484
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:40,725
Speaker 1:  disappears overnight. There are people trying to

485
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:44,605
Speaker 1:  make that happen more either more slowly

486
00:28:44,745 --> 00:28:47,925
Speaker 1:  or reverse it. So Razor the scooter company

487
00:28:48,555 --> 00:28:52,165
Speaker 1:  buys that original 2013 patent from Shane Chen in

488
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:56,125
Speaker 1:  2015 and decides to simultaneously go make safer,

489
00:28:56,275 --> 00:29:00,245
Speaker 1:  more legit versions of the hoverboard. They start to get the the UL certification.

490
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:04,245
Speaker 1:  Yeah. They start to go like take more care of the batteries and start

491
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:07,645
Speaker 1:  to actually like build these things in a safe way and they go just sue the

492
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:11,165
Speaker 1:  pants off of everybody else who is making Hoverboards. Everybody's suing

493
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:14,805
Speaker 1:  everybody. And then there just becomes this question of like, is any of this

494
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:19,525
Speaker 1:  different enough to be defensible? Yeah. And as far as I can tell,

495
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:23,365
Speaker 1:  overwhelmingly the answer became somewhere between No.

496
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:27,685
Speaker 1:  And nobody cares. And I think that just seemed to be the, the end

497
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:31,445
Speaker 1:  of the story there is everybody picked these fights forever about these

498
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:34,525
Speaker 1:  patents and then just kind of decided, eh, it's

499
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:38,365
Speaker 6:  Too much. Our court system does not move nearly at the speed of sort of

500
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:42,205
Speaker 6:  viral viral anything, let alone viral like product.

501
00:29:42,355 --> 00:29:45,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You know, just that that was never going to be something they could

502
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:48,605
Speaker 6:  sort out in time for this thing, for it to matter for this product.

503
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:52,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And it was just always destined to come out of fashion before a

504
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,925
Speaker 6:  judgment came from some district court judge.

505
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:58,925
Speaker 1:  Yeah, true. Well I found myself wondering like the, I think the thing

506
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:02,845
Speaker 1:  that there's no coming back from was all the safety stuff, right? Like there

507
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:06,005
Speaker 1:  was just no, it got so bad and so

508
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,525
Speaker 1:  publicized that I think even now I suspect

509
00:30:10,045 --> 00:30:13,005
Speaker 1:  everyone's first association with Hoverboards is explosions. Yeah. Yeah.

510
00:30:13,005 --> 00:30:16,965
Speaker 1:  Like I And I, there's just no coming back from that. But I do wonder 'cause

511
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:20,845
Speaker 1:  if you, if you rewind to the beginning of 2015, like again, this whole story

512
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:24,605
Speaker 1:  takes place in 12 months, which is insanity. But if you

513
00:30:24,785 --> 00:30:28,125
Speaker 1:  rewind back to the beginning of it, there was a real sense.

514
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:32,005
Speaker 1:  This thing is huge. Everybody's into it.

515
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:35,245
Speaker 1:  It's, it's a good idea. It's a fun product. People like it, but there is

516
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:39,165
Speaker 1:  no brand that's gonna work. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it was

517
00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:42,925
Speaker 1:  Joe Bernstein in Buzzfeed that compared it to jet ski where it's like, right,

518
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:45,885
Speaker 1:  there are, there are lots of ways to move around on the water. There's only

519
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:48,845
Speaker 1:  one jet ski. And if you could have been the one to come in and be like, okay,

520
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:52,805
Speaker 1:  screw io Hawks screw funky duck, all these dumb brands we're gonna be the

521
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:56,925
Speaker 1:  one like the Yeah. The sort of brand name the, the Kleenex

522
00:30:56,925 --> 00:31:00,525
Speaker 1:  of the space that that was going to be massively,

523
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:04,565
Speaker 1:  massively valuable. And it's sort of sad to me that we didn't get

524
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:05,885
Speaker 1:  to see that from

525
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:08,605
Speaker 5:  You. I mean it could have happened that's Yeah. If it didn't explode and

526
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:11,405
Speaker 5:  they didn't catch on fire and people hadn't died there, we could have gotten

527
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:14,765
Speaker 5:  to a point where there might have been some sort of incumbent, whether it

528
00:31:14,765 --> 00:31:18,605
Speaker 5:  was, you know, Ile Hawker or Mark Cuban's thing or

529
00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:22,765
Speaker 5:  whatever it was that that could have emerged eventually had there been

530
00:31:22,765 --> 00:31:26,685
Speaker 5:  more time I think. And, but because there was this like hard stop

531
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:31,125
Speaker 5:  at, you know, explosions, it didn't really get there and, and we're still

532
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:34,765
Speaker 5:  kind of in a place where there's a million different brands and they are

533
00:31:34,765 --> 00:31:37,405
Speaker 5:  still available and they're a lot safer obviously now than they, than they

534
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:41,365
Speaker 5:  were before. But I feel because there was that disruption in

535
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:44,285
Speaker 5:  the mid in like sort of like right in midstream as this thing was getting

536
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:46,165
Speaker 5:  going, it kind of prevented it from happening.

537
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:50,405
Speaker 6:  I think that that moment too, it was a reset moment because not

538
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:54,165
Speaker 6:  only was there a safety threat, even people who didn't really

539
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:57,085
Speaker 6:  care much about that couldn't really buy them as easily all of a sudden.

540
00:31:57,705 --> 00:32:01,045
Speaker 6:  And I think that that gave people enough space to realize

541
00:32:01,835 --> 00:32:04,925
Speaker 6:  like what really is the utility of this thing. Yeah. You know, you talked

542
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:08,605
Speaker 6:  earlier about this idea that was sort of really in vogue at the time of like

543
00:32:09,025 --> 00:32:13,005
Speaker 6:  the last mile thing. You know, you're gonna take a, you know, a

544
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:16,685
Speaker 6:  train somewhere, but you're going to have that last mile to your

545
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,525
Speaker 6:  destination. Should it be an electric bike? An electric scooter? Electric

546
00:32:20,325 --> 00:32:23,885
Speaker 6:  skateboard or something like this. But, but I think people started to realize

547
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:27,765
Speaker 6:  in that sort of hangover moment of like, does this really actually

548
00:32:27,765 --> 00:32:31,325
Speaker 6:  work like that? I mean you can take these things down like a sidewalk,

549
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:36,005
Speaker 6:  but like if there's a bump, like you're kind of doomed.

550
00:32:36,435 --> 00:32:39,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You know, and it's like it really, you know, we talked earlier about

551
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:41,965
Speaker 6:  sort of, we were joking about like could we even ride it in this studio space?

552
00:32:41,965 --> 00:32:45,645
Speaker 6:  Like it really is a thing that only works that well on like the shiny

553
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:49,525
Speaker 6:  floors of Justin Bieber's mansion or Yeah. Or an airport I guess. But

554
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:53,365
Speaker 6:  like for real, actual transportation, they are not as

555
00:32:53,365 --> 00:32:55,925
Speaker 6:  useful as I think any of those early

556
00:32:57,205 --> 00:33:00,565
Speaker 6:  companies, marketers, whoever would've really wanted people to believe. And

557
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:04,365
Speaker 6:  there were some attempts at making a changing that a little bit.

558
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:07,485
Speaker 6:  But it's tricky when you're dealing with self-balancing stuff. Especially

559
00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:12,005
Speaker 6:  any, even if you're the wheels can handle it, you're gonna run into trouble

560
00:33:12,005 --> 00:33:14,725
Speaker 6:  if you're going over sort of uneven surfaces. 'cause it's just gonna naturally

561
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:18,165
Speaker 6:  gonna throw off the inputs that you're giving into it and it just spirals

562
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:21,765
Speaker 6:  a bit out of control. And so it's, I think the most competent version of

563
00:33:21,765 --> 00:33:25,605
Speaker 6:  that that we've ever seen is eventually the, the seg nine bot one

564
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:29,445
Speaker 6:  that really has, it's essentially a shrunk down segue with no stock to like

565
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:32,725
Speaker 6:  lean on with your hands. And that is like something that actually

566
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:37,325
Speaker 6:  probably works in those settings but is definitely more cumbersome,

567
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:41,165
Speaker 6:  not as easy to carry around on the subway or wherever. Like, like these were,

568
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:41,605
Speaker 6:  what

569
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:43,885
Speaker 5:  Is the problem that we're solving with this walking?

570
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:45,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like

571
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:49,885
Speaker 5:  I think walking's fine. I don't see walking hot take as a problem. You know?

572
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:54,085
Speaker 5:  I understand that. Disagree, But no, I mean like if

573
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:56,565
Speaker 5:  that, if that was, if that was the problem. 'cause otherwise it was just

574
00:33:56,605 --> 00:34:00,085
Speaker 5:  a novelty and it was just for Yeah. It became a punchline eventually where

575
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:03,965
Speaker 5:  like, you know, characters on tv, if you saw a character on, on a show

576
00:34:03,985 --> 00:34:07,765
Speaker 5:  or TV on a, on a, on a hoverboard, it was like that person's a clown.

577
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:10,885
Speaker 5:  Right. Like that Yeah. You know, it was like John Ralphio from Parks and

578
00:34:10,885 --> 00:34:13,845
Speaker 5:  Rec or something like that. Like, you know, like that it was, it was meant

579
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:17,725
Speaker 5:  to send the signal that this is like an unserious person. Yeah. And

580
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:21,525
Speaker 5:  so that's, and then I think it quickly sort of became associated with less

581
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:24,725
Speaker 5:  of the utility and more of sort of like the jokey like novel,

582
00:34:24,725 --> 00:34:27,365
Speaker 6:  Which is funny 'cause around that same time, the same sort of aspersions

583
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,565
Speaker 6:  were being cast on people who were using the earliest versions of like the

584
00:34:30,845 --> 00:34:33,965
Speaker 6:  electric kick scooters that we see around a lot of major cities. Yeah. Yeah.

585
00:34:34,145 --> 00:34:37,485
Speaker 6:  But that has utility to it. Yeah. So now people care less,

586
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:41,565
Speaker 6:  probably still some, but less about how weird they look if it just gets them

587
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:44,045
Speaker 6:  somewhere and quickly Yeah. And this was never gonna solve that problem.

588
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:44,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean,

589
00:34:44,765 --> 00:34:48,245
Speaker 1:  And again, go back to sort of the, the world at that time. It's like you

590
00:34:48,245 --> 00:34:51,885
Speaker 1:  were talking about, we were like, okay, robo taxis are gonna take me everywhere.

591
00:34:51,955 --> 00:34:55,925
Speaker 1:  Yeah. The the Hyperloop is gonna change my

592
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:59,765
Speaker 1:  life. Oh God. Like we were in this phase of it's not going to be

593
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:03,165
Speaker 1:  that long until you don't own a car anymore. Right. It was a thing a lot

594
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:07,045
Speaker 1:  of people would have you believe at the time. Yeah. And in that world, something

595
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:11,005
Speaker 1:  like this that is like, I just need to quickly get to the coffee shop. Yeah.

596
00:35:11,015 --> 00:35:14,765
Speaker 1:  Makes a lot more sense. And I own more cars than I did in 2015.

597
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:15,645
Speaker 6:  And it's like

598
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:19,045
Speaker 5:  Amazing to me that none of the car companies like tried to buy like

599
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:22,325
Speaker 5:  hover tracks or like, 'cause that's what they did with the scooter companies,

600
00:35:22,325 --> 00:35:25,645
Speaker 5:  right. They like, they saw like Ford and others saw an opportunity, they're

601
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:29,245
Speaker 5:  like, we have to get a piece of this. This is gonna be huge. Yeah. And I

602
00:35:29,245 --> 00:35:32,925
Speaker 5:  think because there was that, that disruption sort of like mid cycle as this

603
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:36,805
Speaker 5:  thing was just gaining momentum, like escape velocity. It was getting there.

604
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:40,245
Speaker 5:  Like you could have had like GM swoop in and like, buy

605
00:35:40,245 --> 00:35:43,605
Speaker 6:  One of these. I'm dying. I'm like dying thinking about like the the 30

606
00:35:43,955 --> 00:35:47,845
Speaker 6:  page slide deck that someone prepared for Mary Barra at GM of

607
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:51,605
Speaker 6:  like, here's why we should acquire Iowa Hawk. And then they

608
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:54,445
Speaker 6:  start exploding and she's like, get outs. The future of

609
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:56,405
Speaker 5:  Transportation is the hover

610
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:59,565
Speaker 6:  Tracks. I'm gonna invest a billion dollars in cruises instead. Like

611
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:04,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah, you could argue which one of those went better. I'm just saying. So

612
00:36:04,525 --> 00:36:08,285
Speaker 1:  anyway, okay. So the story here basically ends with, you can still go to

613
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:11,725
Speaker 1:  a store and buy a hoverboard, which I will be honest is not a thing I knew

614
00:36:11,935 --> 00:36:15,525
Speaker 1:  until I was researching this. I they're pretty cheap by all accounts. They're

615
00:36:15,525 --> 00:36:18,565
Speaker 1:  pretty safe. Yeah. They, they're like, they're just out there. They're mostly

616
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:22,845
Speaker 1:  now called Hover tracks. The the whole thing is owned by

617
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:26,405
Speaker 1:  Razor. But I think Shane Chen kind of got his, got his piece. He, he won

618
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:28,925
Speaker 1:  in the end. Nice. He sold the patent. They're still called Hover tracks.

619
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:31,885
Speaker 1:  They're still out there. I wanna talk about two more things before we get

620
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:35,605
Speaker 1:  to the Version History questions. One is, during all of this

621
00:36:35,785 --> 00:36:39,685
Speaker 1:  you, Sean had an actual experience with an actual hoverboard.

622
00:36:40,305 --> 00:36:44,045
Speaker 6:  Yes. That's one of the crazy things too. I feel like this was

623
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:47,365
Speaker 6:  a thing that we, we set aside because it was such a weird moment.

624
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:52,405
Speaker 6:  But I think another element of why these things took off was because

625
00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:56,645
Speaker 6:  it was just like hoverboard mania for a few years because there

626
00:36:56,645 --> 00:36:59,445
Speaker 6:  were all these other companies at the time trying to do,

627
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:04,525
Speaker 6:  I, we were coming up on 2015 was what? The 30th anniversary

628
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:08,165
Speaker 6:  of Back to the Future. The date In fact of the future.

629
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:11,925
Speaker 6:  So, you know, there were all these people who were like gearing themselves

630
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:15,285
Speaker 6:  up to be like all retrospective about Back to the Future and the hoverboard

631
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:19,245
Speaker 6:  and, and, and so I think people

632
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:21,565
Speaker 6:  were just ready for it. And all these other companies, there was this company

633
00:37:21,565 --> 00:37:24,765
Speaker 6:  called Hendo. There was, or Arcs pacs I think was the one that was actually

634
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:27,285
Speaker 6:  behind that. And there were, there were all these, they were coming up with

635
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:31,085
Speaker 6:  weird ways to try to make all air

636
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:34,485
Speaker 6:  quotes here, make Hoverboards that worked.

637
00:37:35,345 --> 00:37:38,725
Speaker 6:  And it was like, you know, they would be okay this one hovers

638
00:37:39,115 --> 00:37:42,965
Speaker 6:  with like magnetics over like non Ferris metal surfaces.

639
00:37:43,235 --> 00:37:45,045
Speaker 6:  Okay, cool. Like and they remember they

640
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:46,485
Speaker 1:  They were science projects. Yeah, exactly.

641
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:47,045
Speaker 6:  They cool,

642
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:49,085
Speaker 5:  They're essential. You could just take it anywhere that they're

643
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:52,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah. There, there was one for a while. Oh man, the name escapes me.

644
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:56,685
Speaker 6:  But there was one where it was actually from a, a, a space company.

645
00:37:57,365 --> 00:38:00,765
Speaker 6:  I think their name was ACA Space. And, and they were trying to do almost

646
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:04,565
Speaker 6:  like Aducted fan one that had like 40 or 50

647
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:08,605
Speaker 6:  or even more like little ducted fans, which looked

648
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:11,685
Speaker 6:  like a nightmare ride because like you're basically balancing on like an

649
00:38:11,685 --> 00:38:14,805
Speaker 6:  air, like a small airboat. And so there were all these things and then I,

650
00:38:14,865 --> 00:38:17,845
Speaker 6:  the big one that I remember was there was this sort of

651
00:38:19,815 --> 00:38:23,565
Speaker 6:  hoaxy video that Tony Hawk did where it was digitally edited to make it

652
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:27,805
Speaker 6:  look like he was actually writing a hoverboard. And it had been created and

653
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,245
Speaker 6:  here it is. And it was just some viral stump for something else. And it was

654
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:34,965
Speaker 6:  like, that was the moment where that was happening. Like alongside all of

655
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:39,005
Speaker 6:  this stuff, just sort of fueling the mania. And then the, the

656
00:38:39,245 --> 00:38:42,365
Speaker 6:  craziest one of all of 'em was like all of a sudden we got a call one day

657
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:46,885
Speaker 6:  from a a a, a pr PR rep who worked for

658
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:50,725
Speaker 6:  Lexus and, And I pick up the phone 'cause I, I'm one of those crazy people

659
00:38:50,725 --> 00:38:53,805
Speaker 6:  that picks up every phone call that I get, even if it looks like it's gonna

660
00:38:53,805 --> 00:38:57,565
Speaker 6:  be spam. 'cause you never know. And they were like, Hey,

661
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:01,325
Speaker 6:  like we we're doing this thing in Spain and

662
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:05,085
Speaker 6:  we want to know if you're interested. And they were describing it and it

663
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:08,565
Speaker 6:  was this whole thing about doing a real hoverboard. And we weren't really

664
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:11,645
Speaker 6:  sure of all the specifics, but it looked like we were looking at some of

665
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:14,485
Speaker 6:  the stuff that they were showing us and it was like, this looks like legit.

666
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:18,325
Speaker 6:  And I remember just like on, still on the phone, like scouring

667
00:39:18,345 --> 00:39:21,965
Speaker 6:  the office looking around like, where is Sam Scheffer? We need to get into

668
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:25,725
Speaker 6:  Spain. And it was like right around 4th of July too. So I remember it

669
00:39:25,725 --> 00:39:29,165
Speaker 6:  just being like, I'm sorry if I'm blowing up your holiday, but like, you

670
00:39:29,165 --> 00:39:32,845
Speaker 6:  should go to Spain. Like, like you're welcome.

671
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There are worst

672
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:35,085
Speaker 1:  Things to be told. Over the

673
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:37,325
Speaker 6:  4th of July he went and it was like, you know, again, it was another one

674
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:39,845
Speaker 6:  of these things where it was very science experimented. They basically just

675
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:43,365
Speaker 6:  built an entire skate park that had

676
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:47,445
Speaker 6:  magnetic rails underneath most of the park.

677
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:51,165
Speaker 6:  And it was, you know, it was similar to if you've ever seen those things

678
00:39:51,165 --> 00:39:55,085
Speaker 6:  where there's like a super cool piece of some material and it kind

679
00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:58,845
Speaker 6:  of like, you know, hovers over a base of some other material.

680
00:39:59,145 --> 00:40:02,405
Speaker 6:  It was essentially that. But they had balanced it out well and they had worked

681
00:40:02,405 --> 00:40:05,725
Speaker 6:  with some skateboarders and they, they went through all the work to make

682
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:09,685
Speaker 6:  it a really work but it within its

683
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:12,685
Speaker 6:  own limits. And it was, I remember he had so much trouble

684
00:40:13,475 --> 00:40:16,925
Speaker 6:  getting it to work because it's in Spain, it's very hot. It was the summer,

685
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:21,285
Speaker 6:  the materials they were using had to be cooled to a certain temperature.

686
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,525
Speaker 6:  If it went above it. They had to swap out the board. But you know, he was

687
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:28,365
Speaker 6:  able to, you know, even all those constraints like set those aside, he was

688
00:40:28,365 --> 00:40:31,405
Speaker 6:  able to ride a skateboard on a skate park that hovered. And it was like a

689
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:34,325
Speaker 6:  really cool moment. Like we filmed a really good video about it and it was

690
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:38,285
Speaker 6:  like such a fun, weird thing. Again, it was just a stunt, but

691
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:40,685
Speaker 6:  it was like all that was happening at the same time that all this stuff was

692
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:44,365
Speaker 6:  happening, which was like fueling the mania of this product,

693
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:48,085
Speaker 6:  but also even just the idea of calling them a hoverboard in the first place.

694
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:52,005
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And this one actually hovered, let me, I I have a clip of that video,

695
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:55,725
Speaker 1:  which if memory serves was one of the verges most

696
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:57,325
Speaker 1:  successful and viewed videos

697
00:40:57,335 --> 00:40:58,485
Speaker 6:  Still, still to this day, day I

698
00:40:58,485 --> 00:41:00,405
Speaker 1:  Think almost. Yeah. It's truly wild here It is. It

699
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:04,325
Speaker 19:  Hovers off the ground like a proper hoverboard. But as I'm sure you've

700
00:41:04,325 --> 00:41:08,005
Speaker 19:  guessed, there are some big caveats like the track it needs to run on, which

701
00:41:08,005 --> 00:41:11,165
Speaker 19:  is crucial to how the thing works at all. The board, I mean,

702
00:41:11,665 --> 00:41:15,645
Speaker 6:  It looks cool because it's designed well, but it looks like all the

703
00:41:15,645 --> 00:41:17,525
Speaker 6:  liquid nitrogen coming off, it just like makes it look

704
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:20,965
Speaker 1:  The magnetic. Nothing about this is real, but it's sick

705
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:23,925
Speaker 19:  Vertically with the center of the board. So it's, I mean it

706
00:41:23,925 --> 00:41:24,445
Speaker 6:  Looks like it's on

707
00:41:24,445 --> 00:41:25,845
Speaker 19:  The ground around tightrope. And

708
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:27,165
Speaker 6:  If your balance there does is perfectly

709
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:31,085
Speaker 19:  Distributed on this thing, you end up scraping the ground with the undersides

710
00:41:31,085 --> 00:41:32,725
Speaker 19:  of the board. It took me like

711
00:41:32,725 --> 00:41:34,685
Speaker 1:  15 minutes just to glide

712
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:36,885
Speaker 5:  A few feet. Oh yeah. You can kind of see that's a good angle.

713
00:41:37,435 --> 00:41:40,165
Speaker 6:  That was where the heat was working against them too, where it was like the

714
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:43,605
Speaker 6:  hotter it was the, the less whatever the force was was working.

715
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:46,805
Speaker 6:  So I remember him telling me that he was struggling with that part of it

716
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:50,485
Speaker 6:  and it was, it took them a minute to really get one with just the right

717
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:54,045
Speaker 6:  amount of like the liquid nitrogen or whatever it was to, to get it to hover

718
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:55,285
Speaker 6:  in a frame to really try and ride it.

719
00:41:55,405 --> 00:41:59,285
Speaker 5:  IIII rode one of the ones on the metal surface Oh yeah. At, at a

720
00:41:59,285 --> 00:42:03,245
Speaker 5:  Hyperloop event. Sure. As it were. Yeah. In

721
00:42:03,245 --> 00:42:06,485
Speaker 5:  Texas, a SpaceX had this big hyperloop competition

722
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:10,885
Speaker 5:  at Texas eight M University. And like one of the vendors that was there showing

723
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,045
Speaker 5:  off like their products was one of the, I, I forget which one it was. I think

724
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:14,245
Speaker 5:  it was

725
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:14,645
Speaker 6:  The Hendo

726
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:17,165
Speaker 5:  One. It might have been the Hendo one, but the, I remember the funny thing

727
00:42:17,165 --> 00:42:20,485
Speaker 5:  about that was they, they made you hold hands with somebody Yeah. While you

728
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:23,645
Speaker 5:  were on it. So I'm like, this is the most like yeah. Nursery school

729
00:42:24,235 --> 00:42:27,765
Speaker 5:  demo I've ever done in my entire life. I'm holding hands with this man as

730
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:28,925
Speaker 5:  I write on a, I actual, I

731
00:42:28,925 --> 00:42:31,045
Speaker 6:  Like that you wrote a hoverboard, but you've never ridden a hoverboard board

732
00:42:31,045 --> 00:42:31,245
Speaker 6:  on the

733
00:42:31,245 --> 00:42:34,205
Speaker 5:  Hoverboard. Yes. I know. That's the, that's one of the weird things about

734
00:42:34,205 --> 00:42:34,845
Speaker 5:  me. I

735
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:38,285
Speaker 1:  Also like that that's like what the future of the hyperloop should have been.

736
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:42,125
Speaker 1:  Yes. Like just put up rails and let us all hoverboard from San

737
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:44,725
Speaker 5:  Francisco to LA while holding. Well they're all about magnetic levitation.

738
00:42:45,015 --> 00:42:47,445
Speaker 5:  Right at at Hyperloop Inc. That's

739
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:50,125
Speaker 1:  Exactly right. So, okay. And then the last thing we have to talk about, which

740
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:53,365
Speaker 1:  is the only thing that matters in this entire thing, all of this has been

741
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:56,525
Speaker 1:  a waste except for one important question, which is

742
00:42:57,185 --> 00:43:01,165
Speaker 1:  why the hell are these things called Hoverboards? They don't hover. Yeah.

743
00:43:01,635 --> 00:43:02,765
Speaker 6:  Fair point taken.

744
00:43:02,865 --> 00:43:06,085
Speaker 1:  But they are Hoverboards and they, they, they just are Hoverboards.

745
00:43:06,085 --> 00:43:09,445
Speaker 6:  There was never any other good name. Yeah. To call them,

746
00:43:09,945 --> 00:43:12,725
Speaker 6:  you know, like we, we ran through a few of them already, like

747
00:43:13,145 --> 00:43:16,885
Speaker 6:  self-balancing scooter, you know, just nothing that like really rolled off

748
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:20,725
Speaker 6:  the tongue. And then, you know, I I where that comes from, I don't even really

749
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:24,685
Speaker 6:  remember again this, there was this sort of cultural thing

750
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:28,485
Speaker 6:  happening, like I said at the same time where Hoverboards were in our

751
00:43:29,035 --> 00:43:33,005
Speaker 6:  mind in a way that they hadn't been in years prior. And so, you know,

752
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:36,765
Speaker 6:  I think it just, it became a good shorthand for it. And again, like to the

753
00:43:36,765 --> 00:43:39,725
Speaker 6:  what, like I said earlier, if you're not looking at what somebody's doing

754
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,725
Speaker 6:  and you're just seeing there like torso and Ed coming at you, it looks

755
00:43:43,725 --> 00:43:47,565
Speaker 6:  like you're hovering. It looks like you are floating at me as a specter

756
00:43:47,615 --> 00:43:51,005
Speaker 6:  about to like, you know, it's just Yeah. I get it.

757
00:43:51,225 --> 00:43:54,885
Speaker 1:  So I want to see if we can rename this thing very quickly

758
00:43:55,715 --> 00:43:59,365
Speaker 1:  knowing what we know now. Is there a better name for this thing?

759
00:43:59,765 --> 00:43:59,885
Speaker 1:  I

760
00:43:59,885 --> 00:44:03,045
Speaker 5:  Mean, I kind of agree with Sean that you can't, you can't really beat hoverboard

761
00:44:03,105 --> 00:44:04,885
Speaker 5:  in terms of like the cultural,

762
00:44:05,065 --> 00:44:05,525
Speaker 1:  But it doesn't

763
00:44:05,695 --> 00:44:07,805
Speaker 5:  Hover Ations that it has rolly

764
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:10,405
Speaker 6:  Board roll board. No bad ideas. Go ly.

765
00:44:10,405 --> 00:44:11,845
Speaker 5:  Board Glide. Glide Ride. Glide Ride. Can

766
00:44:11,845 --> 00:44:12,445
Speaker 1:  We just call it a

767
00:44:12,445 --> 00:44:13,485
Speaker 6:  Scooter Spin Doctor?

768
00:44:13,835 --> 00:44:15,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah, there you go. Glide Ride

769
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:18,565
Speaker 1:  Is actually very good. It's nothing but it's very good.

770
00:44:18,565 --> 00:44:18,925
Speaker 5:  It's nothing

771
00:44:21,035 --> 00:44:23,405
Speaker 5:  Spin Doctor's good. I like Spin Doctor. I can

772
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:26,805
Speaker 6:  See somebody selling it as the Spin Doctor. Yeah. The company's called something

773
00:44:26,805 --> 00:44:26,925
Speaker 6:  else.

774
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:27,245
Speaker 5:  Brand

775
00:44:27,245 --> 00:44:28,125
Speaker 1:  Name. Yeah, for

776
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:28,285
Speaker 6:  Sure.

777
00:44:28,595 --> 00:44:30,325
Speaker 5:  Tilt O World Tilt World.

778
00:44:31,675 --> 00:44:33,445
Speaker 1:  This is all making me like hoverboard more

779
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:38,445
Speaker 5:  Ass blaster. I said you followed your ass.

780
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:40,405
Speaker 6:  Zoom, scooter

781
00:44:42,635 --> 00:44:44,765
Speaker 6:  Foot. There's probably something with Foot, right? Yeah,

782
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:45,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Foot,

783
00:44:46,315 --> 00:44:48,085
Speaker 6:  Foot Wheel Foot. Mobile. Mobile.

784
00:44:48,665 --> 00:44:51,085
Speaker 5:  That's gonna get a whole other demographic. Yeah. Interested

785
00:44:51,085 --> 00:44:51,925
Speaker 6:  In it. Hey listen.

786
00:44:52,345 --> 00:44:53,205
Speaker 5:  The foot demographic.

787
00:44:54,065 --> 00:44:57,245
Speaker 1:  All right, fine. It's Hoverboards. This sucks. This didn't go at all how

788
00:44:57,245 --> 00:44:58,085
Speaker 1:  I was hoping it was going

789
00:44:58,085 --> 00:44:59,365
Speaker 5:  To. They're called Icarus

790
00:44:59,415 --> 00:45:03,285
Speaker 6:  Wings. Unironically Touch the

791
00:45:03,305 --> 00:45:03,525
Speaker 6:  Sun.

792
00:45:05,365 --> 00:45:07,045
Speaker 5:  I stand by Glide Ride. I feel good about that.

793
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:09,565
Speaker 1:  Glide Ride's pretty good. Glide is like, I think we just came up with a bunch

794
00:45:09,565 --> 00:45:13,405
Speaker 1:  of good company names. Like when we're gonna bring the hoverboard

795
00:45:13,405 --> 00:45:14,725
Speaker 1:  back, we're gonna call it the

796
00:45:14,805 --> 00:45:16,805
Speaker 5:  Glide Rides. Well here's the thing that's gonna stick. You noted that the,

797
00:45:16,805 --> 00:45:20,365
Speaker 5:  the Hoverboards still around. I was at my children's talent show

798
00:45:20,365 --> 00:45:24,205
Speaker 5:  earlier this year in amidst all of the terrible renditions of

799
00:45:24,545 --> 00:45:28,445
Speaker 5:  frozen songs and Pink Pony Club and all the other things that

800
00:45:28,445 --> 00:45:32,245
Speaker 5:  were going on. Two kids came out on Hoverboards and did a

801
00:45:32,245 --> 00:45:35,405
Speaker 5:  hoverboard dance to some song I'd never heard before. I think it was like

802
00:45:35,405 --> 00:45:37,805
Speaker 5:  a Minecraft song or so like that. This was recently, this was, this was like

803
00:45:38,005 --> 00:45:41,965
Speaker 5:  a couple months ago and they were wearing like glittery spandex like

804
00:45:42,355 --> 00:45:46,125
Speaker 5:  outfits and they killed it. Shout out to Nico

805
00:45:46,225 --> 00:45:47,805
Speaker 5:  and Brooks. Those kids

806
00:45:47,935 --> 00:45:48,845
Speaker 6:  We're sure you're listening

807
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:52,725
Speaker 5:  Were amazing And I, it gave me some songs. 'cause this is not

808
00:45:52,865 --> 00:45:56,005
Speaker 5:  Gen Z or millennials or anyone. This is like Jet Alpha, right? Yeah. These

809
00:45:56,005 --> 00:45:58,205
Speaker 5:  are the kids are still are into 'em. They're still

810
00:45:58,315 --> 00:46:01,685
Speaker 1:  Have, we have, we come all the way back around so that they're vintage. It's

811
00:46:01,685 --> 00:46:04,445
Speaker 1:  like eighties glam cringe cover boards.

812
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:06,925
Speaker 5:  Millennial cringe is back. Right? It's,

813
00:46:07,675 --> 00:46:07,965
Speaker 6:  Well,

814
00:46:08,735 --> 00:46:12,445
Speaker 1:  We're all a thousand years old is the main takeaway from this episode of

815
00:46:12,445 --> 00:46:16,365
Speaker 1:  Version History. Alright, let's oh, one coda to this story.

816
00:46:17,345 --> 00:46:20,645
Speaker 1:  Before we get to the Version History questions, can I share with you what

817
00:46:20,825 --> 00:46:23,485
Speaker 1:  our good friend Shane Chen has been working on recently? Oh,

818
00:46:23,485 --> 00:46:24,005
Speaker 5:  Please. Yes.

819
00:46:24,245 --> 00:46:27,685
Speaker 1:  I have a clip that I would very much like to share with you. So this

820
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:31,525
Speaker 1:  is a product, it is simply called Shane.

821
00:46:32,855 --> 00:46:36,645
Speaker 20:  Shane. A revolutionary new car embraces the laws of physics

822
00:46:36,825 --> 00:46:39,965
Speaker 20:  in an unexpected Oh right invented way. Yes. Large

823
00:46:40,645 --> 00:46:44,605
Speaker 20:  parallel wheels automatically shift relative to the car's body to keep

824
00:46:44,775 --> 00:46:48,565
Speaker 20:  Shane in perfect balance during acceleration and braking, making it

825
00:46:48,565 --> 00:46:52,205
Speaker 20:  stable and safe even at high speeds, a capability not

826
00:46:52,525 --> 00:46:56,005
Speaker 20:  previously possible. Suspended motors and regenerative shocks are

827
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:59,765
Speaker 20:  housed in the wheels, maneuverability and parking are easy

828
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,925
Speaker 20:  thanks to two wheel differential speed control, which eliminates the

829
00:47:03,925 --> 00:47:07,765
Speaker 20:  complicated steering system of today's cars. Pure electronic steering

830
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:11,845
Speaker 20:  makes it a better self-driving car. Shane is practical and

831
00:47:12,085 --> 00:47:14,525
Speaker 20:  efficient for everyday urban and highway driving.

832
00:47:15,025 --> 00:47:18,645
Speaker 1:  The only way I can describe this to you is as hoverboard

833
00:47:18,905 --> 00:47:20,365
Speaker 1:  but spaceship. Yes. It looks

834
00:47:20,915 --> 00:47:22,085
Speaker 6:  It's like a frog car.

835
00:47:23,075 --> 00:47:23,365
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

836
00:47:24,045 --> 00:47:25,325
Speaker 6:  A better self-driving car.

837
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,725
Speaker 5:  Why is there so much parking in the desert? Yeah.

838
00:47:29,505 --> 00:47:33,405
Speaker 6:  My question is like, well one of my questions is,

839
00:47:34,545 --> 00:47:38,365
Speaker 6:  is this something he's been like building towards or is it a new idea? Like

840
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:42,285
Speaker 6:  is it, is it is the dream to always make a car

841
00:47:42,285 --> 00:47:45,325
Speaker 6:  with two wheels named after himself? I mean, I

842
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:49,245
Speaker 1:  Do sort of like the idea that you can, you can go all the way back to all

843
00:47:49,245 --> 00:47:52,725
Speaker 1:  of his inventions. Yeah. And they just get bigger and more expensive and

844
00:47:52,725 --> 00:47:56,085
Speaker 1:  then they end up being a spaceship on self-balancing wheels. Like

845
00:47:56,085 --> 00:47:59,845
Speaker 5:  Are reading an SUV version of this at some 0.3

846
00:47:59,945 --> 00:48:00,565
Speaker 1:  Row Shane.

847
00:48:01,765 --> 00:48:05,405
Speaker 5:  I do like that he was like two wheels. That's it. Oh yeah.

848
00:48:05,825 --> 00:48:09,805
Speaker 5:  For the, that's all we need for everything in our lives is

849
00:48:09,835 --> 00:48:13,445
Speaker 5:  just two wheels. This four wheel stuff. That's bullshit.

850
00:48:13,865 --> 00:48:16,525
Speaker 5:  We need to just narrow it down to two.

851
00:48:16,945 --> 00:48:19,525
Speaker 1:  Did you see how easy it was to park? I mean, come on. That's in's a dream.

852
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,565
Speaker 1:  All right, Shane, I'm glad you did it. Congratulations.

853
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:23,885
Speaker 5:  Dream is alive. You won.

854
00:48:24,105 --> 00:48:25,445
Speaker 6:  You send me the Kickstarter link. I wanna back.

855
00:48:26,165 --> 00:48:29,725
Speaker 1:  I think so. Yeah. We'll, we'll do that with this episode. All right. We need

856
00:48:29,725 --> 00:48:31,805
Speaker 1:  to take one more break and then we're gonna come back and do the Version

857
00:48:31,805 --> 00:48:33,125
Speaker 1:  History questions. We'll be right back.

858
00:49:48,575 --> 00:49:52,155
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. It's time as always, for the eight questions we ask

859
00:49:52,245 --> 00:49:55,875
Speaker 1:  about every product we cover on this show. Question number one,

860
00:49:56,825 --> 00:50:00,275
Speaker 1:  weirdly tricky. In this case, what was the best thing

861
00:50:00,645 --> 00:50:01,675
Speaker 1:  about Hoverboards?

862
00:50:02,655 --> 00:50:02,875
Speaker 6:  Oh,

863
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:03,755
Speaker 1:  Man. Sean, you go first.

864
00:50:04,475 --> 00:50:08,195
Speaker 6:  I like the content, like you just, like all the celebrity

865
00:50:08,615 --> 00:50:12,555
Speaker 6:  Bs and like, you know, people, you know, unboxing videos at

866
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:16,435
Speaker 6:  Christmas. I feel like there was just such a, a moment that we've talked

867
00:50:16,435 --> 00:50:19,675
Speaker 6:  about of like this becoming like

868
00:50:20,345 --> 00:50:24,235
Speaker 6:  something you could read about or watch for days on end and, and that it

869
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:27,685
Speaker 6:  got to like local news, you know, you've got local news

870
00:50:27,685 --> 00:50:31,365
Speaker 6:  penetration where you're just like, you know, someone in like Peoria, Illinois's

871
00:50:31,455 --> 00:50:33,925
Speaker 6:  local station talking about Hoverboards. It was just,

872
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:37,685
Speaker 1:  I do think hoverboard probably got to like a hundred percent brand awareness.

873
00:50:37,685 --> 00:50:41,165
Speaker 1:  Yeah. At some point. It's like Coca-Cola, iPhones,

874
00:50:41,165 --> 00:50:45,085
Speaker 1:  Hoverboards, like that was, it was right up there for a while. Yeah. I, not

875
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:48,285
Speaker 1:  for good reasons, but it was there. That's a good answer. I like that. Andy,

876
00:50:48,285 --> 00:50:49,285
Speaker 1:  what do you think? I, I think

877
00:50:49,285 --> 00:50:52,445
Speaker 5:  It's like how they didn't overstay their welcome that they, I mean, like

878
00:50:52,465 --> 00:50:56,405
Speaker 5:  for, not, not by choice, like they flamed out literally, but I feel

879
00:50:56,405 --> 00:50:59,725
Speaker 5:  like it, it, it, they didn't, they didn't stick around and like, we didn't

880
00:50:59,725 --> 00:51:03,365
Speaker 5:  have to go through like, multiple cycles of, you know, the boom and bust

881
00:51:03,365 --> 00:51:07,245
Speaker 5:  of it all. They just came, they, they made, you know, sort of made their

882
00:51:07,245 --> 00:51:10,605
Speaker 5:  case for themselves and then they started exploding and then that was the

883
00:51:10,605 --> 00:51:13,525
Speaker 5:  end of it. And yeah, they're still around and you know, but they're not as

884
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:17,245
Speaker 5:  big as they were. I, I, I think that that's more products should be like,

885
00:51:17,245 --> 00:51:20,765
Speaker 5:  sort of like the original office where you just like three seasons and you're

886
00:51:20,765 --> 00:51:24,125
Speaker 5:  done and that's it. Like end on a high note,

887
00:51:25,845 --> 00:51:26,965
Speaker 1:  High-ish, you

888
00:51:26,965 --> 00:51:27,045
Speaker 6:  Know,

889
00:51:27,665 --> 00:51:28,645
Speaker 1:  It ended on a note,

890
00:51:29,345 --> 00:51:30,085
Speaker 6:  End on a note.

891
00:51:31,265 --> 00:51:33,285
Speaker 5:  I'm not defending this take at all. It's just a take.

892
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:36,725
Speaker 1:  It's a good take. I like it. I think for me, the, the underrated thing about

893
00:51:36,725 --> 00:51:39,725
Speaker 1:  these things is I think they got the size of the thing

894
00:51:40,595 --> 00:51:44,485
Speaker 1:  kind of right? Like the, one of my problem with all of these, like last

895
00:51:44,575 --> 00:51:47,885
Speaker 1:  Miley things, we, we've, you know, the electric bikes, the electric scooters,

896
00:51:47,885 --> 00:51:51,605
Speaker 1:  all these, they're just enormous. And they're like, I had one of the nine

897
00:51:51,665 --> 00:51:54,565
Speaker 1:  bot scooters for a while and the thing weighed like 45 pounds,

898
00:51:55,435 --> 00:51:59,165
Speaker 1:  like, you know, three feet long, really annoying to carry around. And there

899
00:51:59,165 --> 00:52:01,685
Speaker 1:  was something about like, you could just kind of pick up a hoverboard and

900
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:05,445
Speaker 1:  carry it with you. And it was, it was too heavy in a way that I

901
00:52:05,605 --> 00:52:08,565
Speaker 1:  actually think, like the year three of Hoverboards, they would've figured

902
00:52:08,565 --> 00:52:10,885
Speaker 1:  out how to make it lighter and it would've been more compelling for it. But

903
00:52:11,235 --> 00:52:14,525
Speaker 1:  like there was something about just the basic shape of the thing that I was

904
00:52:14,525 --> 00:52:17,925
Speaker 1:  like, all right, if we're gonna do the last mile thing, this is about the

905
00:52:18,005 --> 00:52:21,805
Speaker 1:  shape of it that feels right to me. Mm. Alright. Question number two is gonna

906
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,645
Speaker 1:  be much easier because the answer is explosions. What was the worst thing

907
00:52:25,645 --> 00:52:26,565
Speaker 1:  about Hoverboards

908
00:52:27,425 --> 00:52:27,845
Speaker 6:  The content?

909
00:52:30,075 --> 00:52:33,645
Speaker 6:  This was sort of more of the wild West days of like influencer marketing

910
00:52:33,665 --> 00:52:37,565
Speaker 6:  and we didn't really know, you know, Kendall General wasn't posting

911
00:52:37,565 --> 00:52:40,965
Speaker 6:  hashtag ad under her posts yet. You know, like that kind of stuff. And it

912
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:44,845
Speaker 6:  was like, there was more than just the Hoverboards or all these like

913
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:48,365
Speaker 6:  electric surfboards and stuff, and it just, it was such a weird time of like,

914
00:52:49,345 --> 00:52:53,205
Speaker 6:  you know, how much of the truth are you telling us

915
00:52:53,205 --> 00:52:57,165
Speaker 6:  here? And, and you know, like I just, that part

916
00:52:57,165 --> 00:52:59,045
Speaker 6:  of it always felt really weird to me.

917
00:52:59,355 --> 00:53:03,205
Speaker 1:  Okay. If I, if I give you 51% of

918
00:53:03,705 --> 00:53:07,525
Speaker 1:  the celebrity hoverboard content was bought and paid for in some way, are

919
00:53:07,525 --> 00:53:08,605
Speaker 1:  you, are you going over or over?

920
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:12,485
Speaker 6:  Oh, over you think? Yeah. I mean, oh, that's so sad. Even if I, I, I say

921
00:53:12,485 --> 00:53:16,285
Speaker 6:  over, but like with the caveat of like, including, there were

922
00:53:16,565 --> 00:53:19,165
Speaker 6:  probably instances where people were getting them for free, but they were

923
00:53:19,325 --> 00:53:22,925
Speaker 6:  probably expecting something in return at some point, you know, like Yeah.

924
00:53:22,925 --> 00:53:26,405
Speaker 1:  Like Justin Bieber probably did not buy his iHawk on Amazon. Yeah.

925
00:53:26,405 --> 00:53:28,845
Speaker 6:  Clear. Yeah, definitely not. So yeah, I would definitely over, yeah, I don't

926
00:53:28,845 --> 00:53:32,405
Speaker 5:  Know if they were cashing big checks. No. You know, from, from any of these

927
00:53:32,645 --> 00:53:35,205
Speaker 5:  companies necessarily, but yeah, they definitely were. There was something

928
00:53:35,205 --> 00:53:35,605
Speaker 5:  going on.

929
00:53:35,635 --> 00:53:37,205
Speaker 1:  Yeah. What about you? What was the worst?

930
00:53:37,405 --> 00:53:41,205
Speaker 5:  I mean, aside from the human toll and the destroyed property

931
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:44,605
Speaker 5:  and, you know, all of that. I probably the name, I guess

932
00:53:45,315 --> 00:53:48,645
Speaker 5:  it's like, you know, 'cause we did, we, you know, we, there could have been,

933
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:52,445
Speaker 5:  we did have Hoverboards and then this sort of supplanted that, and now we

934
00:53:52,445 --> 00:53:55,485
Speaker 5:  can't talk about the concept of Hoverboards without thinking of these things

935
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:57,685
Speaker 5:  first as opposed to the much,

936
00:53:57,865 --> 00:54:01,165
Speaker 6:  And even your children's, you know, that, that whole That's right. Era is

937
00:54:01,245 --> 00:54:02,565
Speaker 6:  tainted now too. Won't

938
00:54:02,565 --> 00:54:05,205
Speaker 5:  They won't even, they, they, they'll grow up in a world never knowing the

939
00:54:05,315 --> 00:54:06,725
Speaker 5:  joys of back to the future.

940
00:54:06,755 --> 00:54:08,725
Speaker 1:  Yeah. They're gonna watch back to the future too and be like, that's not

941
00:54:08,725 --> 00:54:11,285
Speaker 1:  a hoverboard. That's exactly. And you're just gonna die inside. Exactly.

942
00:54:11,285 --> 00:54:11,805
Speaker 1:  It's right there

943
00:54:11,805 --> 00:54:14,685
Speaker 5:  In front of them. That will be the, the day that I, I turn into the guy from

944
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,125
Speaker 5:  the end of last crusade. The Andy's

945
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:18,445
Speaker 6:  Answer is the Indy generational intergenerational trauma.

946
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:20,205
Speaker 5:  Yes. That's

947
00:54:20,205 --> 00:54:23,605
Speaker 1:  Good. All right. Well, it's the explosions. You're both wrong. Question number

948
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:26,885
Speaker 1:  three, would it have been a bigger hit if Apple had made it?

949
00:54:28,055 --> 00:54:29,805
Speaker 1:  Could Apple have made Hoverboards work?

950
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:33,565
Speaker 5:  Apple would've done a secret project Titan like project

951
00:54:33,905 --> 00:54:37,605
Speaker 5:  to develop their own hoverboard for 15 years and then

952
00:54:37,605 --> 00:54:41,565
Speaker 5:  abandoned it after spending $8 billion and

953
00:54:41,725 --> 00:54:42,245
Speaker 5:  deciding, like,

954
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:45,245
Speaker 1:  Would you be be surprised if you learned that there was a hoverboard just

955
00:54:45,445 --> 00:54:49,125
Speaker 1:  embedded into the trunk of the Apple car? That like the timing

956
00:54:49,435 --> 00:54:49,965
Speaker 1:  kind of works, but

957
00:54:49,965 --> 00:54:50,765
Speaker 6:  There was like a space Yeah.

958
00:54:51,085 --> 00:54:52,325
Speaker 5:  Specifically where you plug it in. Like,

959
00:54:52,795 --> 00:54:53,925
Speaker 1:  Like I'm, I'm sure there was a

960
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:56,605
Speaker 6:  Meeting, right? The question is, could Apple have made it successful? Yeah.

961
00:54:58,055 --> 00:54:59,635
Speaker 6:  Oh man. No.

962
00:55:00,145 --> 00:55:00,435
Speaker 1:  Okay.

963
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:04,315
Speaker 6:  Because Johnny, ive would've made it like a single plank of wood

964
00:55:05,655 --> 00:55:06,555
Speaker 6:  and it wouldn't have worked,

965
00:55:06,975 --> 00:55:09,835
Speaker 5:  You know, and it would've come preloaded with just you two. The

966
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:13,075
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It would be about blasting out the, the party speakers on the side.

967
00:55:14,865 --> 00:55:15,835
Speaker 6:  Yeah. No,

968
00:55:15,835 --> 00:55:18,915
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I think I'm also saying, no, I think there's like, it would've been

969
00:55:19,365 --> 00:55:22,035
Speaker 1:  safer if Apple had made it. Yeah. I have a lot of faith in Apple's ability

970
00:55:22,035 --> 00:55:22,315
Speaker 1:  to make

971
00:55:22,635 --> 00:55:24,755
Speaker 6:  Batteries that don't, well, safer on the battery side, maybe not on the riding

972
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:28,675
Speaker 6:  side. Well, right. And industrial design probably. Sure. Better. But still,

973
00:55:28,715 --> 00:55:28,835
Speaker 6:  I

974
00:55:28,835 --> 00:55:30,155
Speaker 5:  Think, yeah, it would've been white and depending

975
00:55:30,305 --> 00:55:31,715
Speaker 6:  Also if it would've been, did,

976
00:55:31,935 --> 00:55:35,915
Speaker 1:  It would've been like five grand and it would've not sold like the, the vision

977
00:55:36,095 --> 00:55:36,715
Speaker 1:  pro of

978
00:55:37,655 --> 00:55:40,315
Speaker 6:  For your feet cover boards. Yeah. Here's the tagline,

979
00:55:40,535 --> 00:55:41,715
Speaker 1:  Not what we're about, I don't think.

980
00:55:43,595 --> 00:55:46,515
Speaker 1:  Question number four. If you could go back and make it yourself, what would

981
00:55:46,515 --> 00:55:50,155
Speaker 1:  you do differently? You're, you're going back, we're the three of us just

982
00:55:50,155 --> 00:55:53,475
Speaker 1:  became hoverboard distributors. It's April of 2015.

983
00:55:53,835 --> 00:55:56,115
Speaker 5:  I, I would put a stock on it And I would call it a segue.

984
00:55:59,115 --> 00:56:02,475
Speaker 5:  I don't know what I would've done differently. I think maybe I would've started

985
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:05,995
Speaker 5:  with the party speaker, speaker angle. Like that would've been like the first

986
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:09,395
Speaker 5:  thing like this. It's not alone, it's not enough. It needs to be like more

987
00:56:09,395 --> 00:56:10,035
Speaker 5:  than what it is.

988
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:14,995
Speaker 1:  I would've tried to make it like rugged and sporty in

989
00:56:14,995 --> 00:56:17,595
Speaker 1:  some way. Mm. Yeah. Because like you mentioned, the, they started doing the

990
00:56:17,595 --> 00:56:20,275
Speaker 1:  ones with like the bigger wheels, a little easier to maneuver. I think

991
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:24,725
Speaker 1:  especially at the beginning. You never experienced this 'cause you're a coward

992
00:56:24,725 --> 00:56:28,485
Speaker 1:  and never tried it. But the first most

993
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:31,405
Speaker 1:  people had a bad first experience Yeah. On a hoverboard. Of course. And,

994
00:56:31,405 --> 00:56:34,285
Speaker 1:  and the question was if you were willing to try it like three or four or

995
00:56:34,285 --> 00:56:37,725
Speaker 1:  five times to kind of get the hang of it. But there's like researching this

996
00:56:37,725 --> 00:56:41,405
Speaker 1:  episode, I saw the same clip so many times of you, the people who stand

997
00:56:41,525 --> 00:56:44,525
Speaker 1:  on the thing and then their legs start wobbling. Yep. Yeah. Because it, it

998
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:46,885
Speaker 1:  takes a minute for your brain to realize, okay, it's, I actually don't move

999
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:49,365
Speaker 1:  my legs. Right. The whole point of this is that I don't move my legs. It's

1000
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:52,525
Speaker 1:  all like, it's an upper body thing most of the time, but they get on and

1001
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:54,925
Speaker 1:  you just sort of wobble back and forth and then fall off and hurt yourself

1002
00:56:54,925 --> 00:56:58,605
Speaker 1:  spectacularly. But they had started to do things with like bigger, wider

1003
00:56:58,745 --> 00:57:02,605
Speaker 1:  wheels, slightly more sort of stable things and try to make

1004
00:57:02,605 --> 00:57:06,365
Speaker 1:  it like more outdoorsy. Yeah. And I just

1005
00:57:06,365 --> 00:57:10,245
Speaker 1:  would've gone straight to that. Be like, this is not a commuter tool. This

1006
00:57:10,245 --> 00:57:12,925
Speaker 1:  is like Pure fun to do like

1007
00:57:12,925 --> 00:57:16,725
Speaker 6:  Shocks, like having some sort of like shocks on it to absorb the bumps. What

1008
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:20,445
Speaker 1:  If it could go on the sidewalk and not try to throw you off every time?

1009
00:57:20,555 --> 00:57:21,885
Speaker 1:  Like I would've just started there.

1010
00:57:23,645 --> 00:57:27,405
Speaker 6:  I would've probably given it more than two wheels. Mm. And

1011
00:57:27,455 --> 00:57:30,965
Speaker 6:  maybe take out the motors. Call it Shane right now. Skateboard. Shane. Shane

1012
00:57:30,965 --> 00:57:32,845
Speaker 6:  is crying. He heard he's hearing motors.

1013
00:57:32,885 --> 00:57:36,005
Speaker 1:  I was imagining three wheels and it's like a triangle that you stand on now

1014
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:38,885
Speaker 6:  We're talking, now we're talking. I like this.

1015
00:57:40,105 --> 00:57:40,325
Speaker 6:  Or

1016
00:57:40,585 --> 00:57:44,525
Speaker 1:  We call it the pyramid and it just, it just takes you along everywhere you're

1017
00:57:44,525 --> 00:57:44,605
Speaker 1:  going.

1018
00:57:44,745 --> 00:57:48,005
Speaker 6:  Or you know what, eight wheels. Whoa, fuck it. You know,

1019
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:49,765
Speaker 6:  fuck it. We're doing eight wheels.

1020
00:57:50,745 --> 00:57:52,605
Speaker 1:  Are we going longer or just more wheels?

1021
00:57:52,865 --> 00:57:56,765
Speaker 6:  No, I think, you know, like in, in octagonal shape. Okay. And you can go

1022
00:57:57,025 --> 00:57:58,005
Speaker 6:  omnidirectional.

1023
00:57:58,585 --> 00:57:59,965
Speaker 1:  So like a stop sign with wheel.

1024
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:03,045
Speaker 6:  Like a true platform. Yes. Like a sign, like a class eight. Like a true like

1025
00:58:03,405 --> 00:58:06,845
Speaker 6:  platform that you're on and you know, instead of just leaning forward back

1026
00:58:06,845 --> 00:58:07,565
Speaker 6:  where you can kind of go into,

1027
00:58:07,665 --> 00:58:09,365
Speaker 1:  Did you have those things in elementary school? That's

1028
00:58:09,365 --> 00:58:09,685
Speaker 6:  What I'm thinking of

1029
00:58:09,685 --> 00:58:11,725
Speaker 1:  With the, yeah, they had the wheels and you would sit on them and hold the

1030
00:58:11,725 --> 00:58:14,565
Speaker 1:  handles and like launch yourself around the gym. Yeah. You're talking about

1031
00:58:14,565 --> 00:58:15,765
Speaker 1:  one of those kind of, but you

1032
00:58:15,765 --> 00:58:17,165
Speaker 6:  Stand on it, but double the wheels.

1033
00:58:17,555 --> 00:58:17,845
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

1034
00:58:18,185 --> 00:58:19,165
Speaker 6:  And you stand on it.

1035
00:58:19,585 --> 00:58:23,045
Speaker 1:  That's the best idea I've heard all day. I love it. Amen. We just, we fixed

1036
00:58:23,045 --> 00:58:23,925
Speaker 1:  it. Chris job

1037
00:58:23,925 --> 00:58:24,125
Speaker 6:  Bust.

1038
00:58:25,195 --> 00:58:26,205
Speaker 1:  Mark Cuban, get at us.

1039
00:58:28,395 --> 00:58:32,285
Speaker 1:  What thing about Hoverboards, the experience of riding them or

1040
00:58:32,525 --> 00:58:36,245
Speaker 1:  the things themselves would you still

1041
00:58:36,275 --> 00:58:40,245
Speaker 1:  want to have today? What last Miley Gadget would you make out of a

1042
00:58:40,245 --> 00:58:40,645
Speaker 1:  hoverboard?

1043
00:58:41,425 --> 00:58:45,085
Speaker 6:  Oh, I see. I mean, I wrote a lot of electric skateboards

1044
00:58:45,385 --> 00:58:48,885
Speaker 6:  And I mean, honestly, a lot of those were trash too. But the booster board

1045
00:58:48,885 --> 00:58:51,805
Speaker 6:  was really good. There was this thing called Z board for a while. Z board

1046
00:58:51,805 --> 00:58:54,765
Speaker 6:  was really good. And that was, that one actually is maybe the closest analog

1047
00:58:54,765 --> 00:58:55,965
Speaker 6:  to this because the Z board,

1048
00:58:57,585 --> 00:59:00,925
Speaker 6:  unlike boosted and a lot of the other ones didn't use a remote. It had foot

1049
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:03,805
Speaker 6:  pressure pads on the front interest of the skateboard.

1050
00:59:03,805 --> 00:59:04,725
Speaker 1:  Oh, interesting. Okay. I don't think I ever tried that one.

1051
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:07,245
Speaker 6:  I mean, the first version of it was very heavy. I don't know that I ever

1052
00:59:07,485 --> 00:59:10,685
Speaker 6:  actually rode the second one outside of maybe a quick demo at CES, but the,

1053
00:59:10,685 --> 00:59:14,045
Speaker 6:  the first one I had for a while while I lived in Queens and like rode around.

1054
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:18,045
Speaker 6:  That was great. I actually really loved that. It was like, was it self balancing?

1055
00:59:18,185 --> 00:59:20,765
Speaker 6:  It wasn't bal I mean, it was just a skateboard. It was like a pretty heavy,

1056
00:59:21,315 --> 00:59:25,085
Speaker 6:  like big wood deck, like longboard with the motors and stuff underneath.

1057
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:28,645
Speaker 6:  But you would, you would speed up and slow down by applying pressure to the

1058
00:59:28,645 --> 00:59:32,525
Speaker 6:  pads on either side. And it was the closest that that form factor ever got

1059
00:59:32,525 --> 00:59:33,405
Speaker 6:  to something like this. I,

1060
00:59:33,505 --> 00:59:35,845
Speaker 1:  That's cool. That's what I was gonna say too is I don't, I don't know about

1061
00:59:35,845 --> 00:59:39,405
Speaker 1:  the self-balancing, but the, the sort of lean to go and lean back to stop

1062
00:59:39,445 --> 00:59:40,765
Speaker 1:  thing I actually think is pretty intuitive.

1063
00:59:40,905 --> 00:59:41,445
Speaker 6:  It was really fun

1064
00:59:41,905 --> 00:59:42,925
Speaker 1:  And, and works pretty well.

1065
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:46,485
Speaker 5:  I mean that's, I think that that's key, like essential to like the delight

1066
00:59:46,485 --> 00:59:50,085
Speaker 5:  of the product, why so many people were attracted to it because they were,

1067
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:53,445
Speaker 5:  they felt like they were doing something right. Like the, like the, the machine

1068
00:59:53,445 --> 00:59:56,245
Speaker 5:  was kind of doing it for them, but they were like balancing on this in like

1069
00:59:56,245 --> 00:59:57,685
Speaker 5:  a way that like was unexpected.

1070
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:02,125
Speaker 1:  And that's so much about that sort of simple movement of your body

1071
01:00:02,315 --> 01:00:06,085
Speaker 1:  that I think is very cool. Alright, question number six. Is there an

1072
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:09,525
Speaker 1:  alternate timeline in which this thing was more or even more successful?

1073
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:15,525
Speaker 5:  I mean, yeah, if they didn't explode, I think they would've probably

1074
01:00:15,595 --> 01:00:19,365
Speaker 5:  continued. I think they would've like petered out and like leveled out at

1075
01:00:19,405 --> 01:00:23,005
Speaker 5:  a certain point. But yeah, I think minus the explosions you could have, like,

1076
01:00:23,305 --> 01:00:27,005
Speaker 5:  you could very well see like a lot of, you know, even

1077
01:00:27,035 --> 01:00:28,805
Speaker 5:  more mainstream of adoption around

1078
01:00:28,805 --> 01:00:31,085
Speaker 1:  This. Do you think there's any world in which they get up to like

1079
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:36,365
Speaker 1:  electric bike level speed? No. Like, oh, penetration.

1080
01:00:36,365 --> 01:00:37,365
Speaker 6:  Oh, adoption. Yeah. Like

1081
01:00:37,865 --> 01:00:38,685
Speaker 1:  If I'm, do

1082
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:41,845
Speaker 5:  I mean, I would argue that Hoverboards had more penetration than E-bikes

1083
01:00:41,845 --> 01:00:42,485
Speaker 5:  did in some

1084
01:00:42,485 --> 01:00:45,285
Speaker 1:  Respects for 10 minutes. For 10. Yeah. Yeah. No, you're right. But you're

1085
01:00:45,285 --> 01:00:48,525
Speaker 1:  right. But I think what I'm thinking of is like, there, there is an age that

1086
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:52,045
Speaker 1:  every kid gets to right? Where they're like, I want a bike. Yeah. And I think

1087
01:00:52,045 --> 01:00:55,725
Speaker 1:  is there ever a world in which Hoverboards ascend

1088
01:00:55,825 --> 01:00:57,325
Speaker 1:  to something like that

1089
01:00:57,325 --> 01:01:01,285
Speaker 6:  Level? I mean, you'll like this No, not in the United States. Like

1090
01:01:01,545 --> 01:01:05,445
Speaker 6:  if, if this country or any of its cities were really oriented around

1091
01:01:05,515 --> 01:01:09,485
Speaker 6:  pedestrians versus cars, then actually I think this

1092
01:01:09,485 --> 01:01:12,485
Speaker 6:  thing would've had a pretty good crack at it. But like the infrastructure

1093
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:16,525
Speaker 6:  is just not there. Like I said, it's like a pebble on the sidewalk is

1094
01:01:16,525 --> 01:01:20,405
Speaker 6:  just gonna throw you off of this thing. And if, if there were more

1095
01:01:21,065 --> 01:01:24,925
Speaker 6:  spaces where you could take these kind of like personal mobility things

1096
01:01:25,555 --> 01:01:29,245
Speaker 6:  than, you know, on smoother surfaces to get rounded actual

1097
01:01:29,835 --> 01:01:33,805
Speaker 6:  city, then maybe there really would be. But that, that's just not

1098
01:01:33,805 --> 01:01:34,685
Speaker 6:  how this country's built.

1099
01:01:34,955 --> 01:01:38,765
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I think I agree with that, that there is, if, if a lot of

1100
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:42,485
Speaker 1:  like the alternate timeline would start in like the 18 hundreds

1101
01:01:43,065 --> 01:01:45,965
Speaker 6:  In order for this thing to, or even further or like back to the future, like

1102
01:01:45,965 --> 01:01:49,925
Speaker 6:  even further into the future from now where it's like the, the

1103
01:01:49,955 --> 01:01:53,725
Speaker 6:  sort of, you know, that that meme of like, this is the future we could have

1104
01:01:53,725 --> 01:01:57,205
Speaker 6:  if only for X, you know? Yeah. And it's like the glossy city with like all

1105
01:01:57,205 --> 01:01:59,645
Speaker 6:  this stuff. Yeah. Like it would have to be something like that. Yeah.

1106
01:01:59,645 --> 01:02:02,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We're riding through the hyperloop tubes on our Exactly. On our Hoverboards,

1107
01:02:03,025 --> 01:02:05,485
Speaker 6:  Our last mile off the hyperloop tubes to,

1108
01:02:06,865 --> 01:02:09,325
Speaker 6:  to go to work at the AI training facility. Yes.

1109
01:02:09,785 --> 01:02:11,365
Speaker 1:  If the, the futures we've lost.

1110
01:02:12,905 --> 01:02:16,205
Speaker 1:  All right. Question number seven. Could you make Hoverboards a thing again

1111
01:02:17,065 --> 01:02:17,285
Speaker 1:  now?

1112
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:21,605
Speaker 5:  I, I, I think so because like yeah, I think that we are in that era where

1113
01:02:22,835 --> 01:02:26,525
Speaker 5:  like there's like, there's no boundary in, in terms of like how, like how

1114
01:02:26,525 --> 01:02:29,725
Speaker 5:  much time has needed to pass before you can feel nostalgic about something.

1115
01:02:29,725 --> 01:02:32,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like everything has just collapsed. Yeah. And it's like, you can feel

1116
01:02:32,485 --> 01:02:36,245
Speaker 5:  nostalgic for 2016. You can feel nostalgic for 2020

1117
01:02:36,345 --> 01:02:40,245
Speaker 5:  if you want to. Like, it does feel like they, people can reach back and take

1118
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:43,125
Speaker 5:  what they want and sort of cherry pick and like cobble together their own

1119
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:47,005
Speaker 5:  kind of like, you know, memories about what the past was and how it

1120
01:02:47,005 --> 01:02:50,685
Speaker 5:  was better. So I, I do think that there could be some, you know, like you

1121
01:02:50,755 --> 01:02:54,245
Speaker 5:  give it to Benson Boone or whomever and he does a back flip off a piano onto

1122
01:02:54,325 --> 01:02:56,885
Speaker 5:  a hoverboard Ooh. At the Oscars or something like that. You,

1123
01:02:56,905 --> 01:03:00,205
Speaker 1:  You, you are making me remember there was a run of

1124
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:04,085
Speaker 1:  hoverboard dance craze during all of this that was like people doing

1125
01:03:04,595 --> 01:03:07,005
Speaker 1:  wild synchronized hoverboard dancing. Sure, yeah.

1126
01:03:07,355 --> 01:03:07,845
Speaker 5:  Child's,

1127
01:03:07,845 --> 01:03:08,445
Speaker 1:  We could absolutely bring that back

1128
01:03:08,445 --> 01:03:10,565
Speaker 5:  School at their, that's talent show. Yes. We

1129
01:03:10,565 --> 01:03:13,405
Speaker 1:  Could absolutely bring that back. I think with without a lot of trouble.

1130
01:03:13,545 --> 01:03:16,125
Speaker 1:  We could bring that back. We could make that happen again. All we need to

1131
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:19,685
Speaker 1:  do is get one, like, it's, it's probably Benson Boone now. Yeah.

1132
01:03:19,725 --> 01:03:20,605
Speaker 6:  I, we call

1133
01:03:20,605 --> 01:03:22,565
Speaker 1:  Taylor Swift on a hoverboard. Like it's done. We get it.

1134
01:03:22,645 --> 01:03:26,125
Speaker 6:  I say we call Soulja Boy. I'm sure he's still got some stock can now

1135
01:03:26,795 --> 01:03:29,245
Speaker 6:  he's got some stock back in a warehouse somewhere. Oh yes.

1136
01:03:29,635 --> 01:03:31,885
Speaker 5:  He's got a closet full just stacked to, to

1137
01:03:31,885 --> 01:03:33,605
Speaker 6:  The ceiling. Nothing but sold Unop

1138
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:34,885
Speaker 5:  Boxes. Yes.

1139
01:03:35,705 --> 01:03:38,765
Speaker 6:  That's what we should call him is just so, I mean, soldier Board nailed it

1140
01:03:38,765 --> 01:03:40,885
Speaker 6:  out the gate. Yes, he did, he did. Soldier board. Yeah.

1141
01:03:41,145 --> 01:03:44,605
Speaker 1:  And he would, he would easily get into business with us on this, I'm sure.

1142
01:03:44,605 --> 01:03:46,605
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So that's great. Okay. We're good. This is

1143
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:47,165
Speaker 5:  All right. New.

1144
01:03:47,785 --> 01:03:50,965
Speaker 1:  We made a lot of money for the, this, this is great news. Last question,

1145
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:55,005
Speaker 1:  do Hoverboards belong in the Version History Hall of Fame? The rules for

1146
01:03:55,005 --> 01:03:58,565
Speaker 1:  the Hall of Fame are nebulous and vibe-y as all hall of fames are,

1147
01:03:59,425 --> 01:04:03,325
Speaker 1:  but I think the, the rubric to the extent that it exists is just,

1148
01:04:04,265 --> 01:04:07,365
Speaker 1:  did this thing matter? Like in the, in the anals of

1149
01:04:07,975 --> 01:04:11,685
Speaker 1:  technology history, were the Hoverboards

1150
01:04:11,755 --> 01:04:15,245
Speaker 1:  sort of capital I important enough to belong in the Hall of Fame?

1151
01:04:15,565 --> 01:04:18,645
Speaker 5:  I do think that there was, you know, like I, there's a universe at which

1152
01:04:18,645 --> 01:04:22,405
Speaker 5:  like, you didn't have Hoverboards, maybe you didn't have e-bikes or

1153
01:04:22,565 --> 01:04:26,525
Speaker 5:  e scooters or e skateboards and all the other sort of mobility devices that

1154
01:04:26,525 --> 01:04:30,285
Speaker 5:  have like, been way more successful than

1155
01:04:30,425 --> 01:04:34,245
Speaker 5:  the hoverboard ever was. Like, you needed to have this kind of like kitschy

1156
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:38,565
Speaker 5:  toy product to come first and also show us,

1157
01:04:38,985 --> 01:04:42,645
Speaker 5:  you know, sort of like the capacity that China has in terms of

1158
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:46,205
Speaker 5:  manufacturing products and seized upon things that

1159
01:04:46,485 --> 01:04:50,325
Speaker 5:  have become popular in other countries and just like flooding the

1160
01:04:50,325 --> 01:04:52,085
Speaker 5:  zone with this kind of stuff. So

1161
01:04:52,085 --> 01:04:54,645
Speaker 6:  Then changing their factories the next week to make like e-cigarettes or

1162
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:54,845
Speaker 6:  whatever,

1163
01:04:54,845 --> 01:04:58,725
Speaker 5:  Like Right, exactly. On a dime. Yeah. So, yeah, I I do feel like that there

1164
01:04:58,725 --> 01:05:01,765
Speaker 5:  is like a version like, you know, like the hover, we needed to have like

1165
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:05,565
Speaker 5:  the boondoggle of the hoverboard in order to get like these much more

1166
01:05:06,075 --> 01:05:09,765
Speaker 5:  utilitarian e mobility devices that are actually

1167
01:05:09,995 --> 01:05:13,645
Speaker 5:  last mile devices that are worthwhile and

1168
01:05:14,305 --> 01:05:18,125
Speaker 5:  should, but it all, it also, it's frustrating because we learned

1169
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:21,725
Speaker 5:  nothing from the hoverboard as well. Correct. Because those products all

1170
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:25,845
Speaker 5:  exploded, inflamed out and did horrible things to people. And we didn't learn

1171
01:05:25,845 --> 01:05:28,485
Speaker 5:  from the hoverboard that we need to make these things safer and there need

1172
01:05:28,485 --> 01:05:31,485
Speaker 5:  to be safer safety standards around the construction of these batteries,

1173
01:05:31,485 --> 01:05:34,565
Speaker 5:  especially. And I wish that we had

1174
01:05:35,835 --> 01:05:39,765
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I like part of that explanation makes me think that no,

1175
01:05:39,765 --> 01:05:43,285
Speaker 1:  it doesn't belong. It's like saying the, the pitcher who taught the other

1176
01:05:43,285 --> 01:05:45,845
Speaker 1:  pitcher how to be better than him belongs in the Hall of Fame. And it's like,

1177
01:05:45,845 --> 01:05:49,405
Speaker 1:  I'm not sure that's right. But I do think everything you just said is true.

1178
01:05:49,405 --> 01:05:52,645
Speaker 1:  And also it was such a moment and it burned so

1179
01:05:53,185 --> 01:05:56,925
Speaker 1:  bright like that, that was the thing that really came back to me in, in prepping

1180
01:05:56,925 --> 01:06:00,325
Speaker 1:  for this was it was so huge. Hillary Clinton.

1181
01:06:00,325 --> 01:06:03,005
Speaker 5:  Clinton was supposed to be the president. Let's just keep that in mind. At

1182
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:06,405
Speaker 5:  that year, that's what all of us were thinking as the hoverboard was gaining

1183
01:06:06,605 --> 01:06:10,485
Speaker 5:  traction. Real different world President Hoverboard. Nope. That's not

1184
01:06:10,485 --> 01:06:11,245
Speaker 5:  the world we live. All

1185
01:06:11,245 --> 01:06:14,445
Speaker 1:  Right. I think we're gonna put it in the Hall of Fame, just because Shane

1186
01:06:14,445 --> 01:06:16,845
Speaker 1:  Chan needs a win. We're doing it for Shane.

1187
01:06:18,065 --> 01:06:19,605
Speaker 5:  You don't wanna put the Shane in there. Well, so

1188
01:06:19,605 --> 01:06:23,405
Speaker 1:  Here's the question though is are we putting the Chic Robotics S one? Yeah.

1189
01:06:23,405 --> 01:06:24,845
Speaker 1:  Which one? Or are we putting the hover tracks?

1190
01:06:25,055 --> 01:06:25,565
Speaker 6:  We're putting

1191
01:06:27,165 --> 01:06:29,845
Speaker 6:  a vague recreation of a patent application in there,

1192
01:06:30,425 --> 01:06:34,125
Speaker 1:  But like the cartoon version of a hoverboard Yeah. Goes in,

1193
01:06:34,235 --> 01:06:37,565
Speaker 1:  goes in the Hall of Fame. I think so. All right. I like it. I feel good about

1194
01:06:37,565 --> 01:06:41,045
Speaker 1:  it. All right. That is it. That's it for the show. Thank you both for being
