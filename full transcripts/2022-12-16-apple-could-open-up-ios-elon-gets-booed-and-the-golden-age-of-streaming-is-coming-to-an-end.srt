Speaker 2:  Hello and welcome to VER the flagship podcast of the

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,340
Speaker 2:  Future of Car Sounds. Today in this episode of the Ver,

26
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,540
Speaker 2:  we're all just going to make like bloop bloop sounds and

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,300
Speaker 2:  then we're gonna decide what car should sound like in the future. Doesn't

28
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,820
Speaker 2:  that sound nice? Doesn't that sound better than what we usually do on the

29
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,060
Speaker 2:  show?

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,980
Speaker 5:  I'm trying to think what my car sound is. I was thinking very, very hard

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,340
Speaker 5:  about it.

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,020
Speaker 6:  What do you want it to sound like when you're getting run over by a driverless

33
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,060
Speaker 6:  Tesla? Like what would, what would you want to hear? Yeah,

34
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,740
Speaker 2:  It's like Tesla. It's a slide whistle center,

35
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,540
Speaker 5:  1967 Mustang.

36
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,220
Speaker 5:  I wanna feel like I got hit.

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,260
Speaker 2:  You want like a dramatic like, like an orchestra hit?

38
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,140
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. I want like

39
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,540
Speaker 5:  that's, that's me going out.

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,660
Speaker 6:  Want the ending theme from Buck Rubs High? Like I should be able to select

41
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,420
Speaker 6:  that on my phone and then it just pops up in their car as it

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,580
Speaker 2:  Happened. Yeah, like today, like in Minority Report styles, like today, you're

43
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,500
Speaker 2:  gonna get hit by an ev. So if you could just go ahead and

44
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,460
Speaker 2:  pick a soundtrack for that, we'll be, we'll be good. Tom

45
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,700
Speaker 2:  Cruise will be dispatching the third judge.

46
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,580
Speaker 5:  You remember a lot more of that movie than I did.

47
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,140
Speaker 2:  If you haven't seen Minority Report,

48
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,100
Speaker 2:  it's truly, it is truly something else. It's so funny that

49
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,740
Speaker 2:  by the way, they get to the, the name Minority Report. It's so integral to

50
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,580
Speaker 2:  the plot and then it means so little. Yeah, it's, it's very good.

51
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,740
Speaker 2:  You should just go, everyone take a break. Turn off the podcast.

52
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,000
Speaker 2:  Wait, go Watch Minority Report.

53
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,520
Speaker 5:  Why is it it called? Is it called that because one of the three

54
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,600
Speaker 5:  sees the different future. Is that why

55
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,560
Speaker 2:  You're spoiling the movie?

56
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,000
Speaker 6:  No, it's been

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,440
Speaker 5:  Out for 20

58
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,720
Speaker 2:  Years. It's

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,920
Speaker 6:  Not what? It's definitely,

60
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,320
Speaker 5:  I'm sorry to everyone. I just ruined Tom

61
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,960
Speaker 2:  Cruises. There many problems with predictive policing that we should just

62
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,680
Speaker 2:  immediately begin with. Yeah. And then obviously the targeted

63
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,920
Speaker 2:  advertising, that movie, it just all came true. Like

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,720
Speaker 2:  Tim Cook's a minority report and he's like, we have to destroy Facebook's

65
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,120
Speaker 2:  business. Let's do app tracking transparency. He

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,360
Speaker 5:  Was just like,

67
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,720
Speaker 2:  One of our has the flagship podcast of talking about Minority Report for

68
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,600
Speaker 2:  no reason 30 years after it came out.

69
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,960
Speaker 2:  We actually have a lot of like housekeeping to do. But first of all, I'm

70
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Speaker 2:  ni Eli, I'm your friend Al Trans here.

71
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,880
Speaker 5:  I'm your friend. Thinking about that one scene between the Gardener lady

72
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,680
Speaker 5:  and Tom Cruise and Minority Report, you know what I'm talking about now you're

73
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,320
Speaker 2:  The memories have all come back, just

74
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,520
Speaker 5:  Just flooded back in. I'm that friend

75
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,960
Speaker 2:  Richard Lawler is

76
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,520
Speaker 6:  Here. I'm your friend who is definitely not under indictment. Say whatever

77
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:03,800
Speaker 6:  you want.

78
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,440
Speaker 2:  David Pierce continues to be off with his new baby. You

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,320
Speaker 2:  know, it happens to the best of us. No, he's great. We wish David

80
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,240
Speaker 2:  well. He'd be back soon enough. We've got a lot going on between now and

81
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,680
Speaker 2:  the end of the year. So obviously we have this episode of the verse has,

82
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,200
Speaker 2:  which will mostly be about the movie Minority Report

83
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,080
Speaker 2:  Buckle. I mean there's, there's actually SPF got

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,840
Speaker 2:  arrested. There's this report that Apple's gonna open up third party app

85
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,240
Speaker 2:  stores. Elon continues to just be himself.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,400
Speaker 2:  There's all kinds of GAT news actually. So there's this episode. Then the

87
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,000
Speaker 2:  holiday spectacular is back my friends. Yeah,

88
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,600
Speaker 2:  you might recall that in the waning years of the Trump

89
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,560
Speaker 2:  administration, I said we were just gonna do an entire hour

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,160
Speaker 2:  about H D M I to just clear the decks reset.

91
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,320
Speaker 2:  For some reason we did this during the holidays and so

92
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,960
Speaker 2:  now during the holidays we do episodes

93
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,680
Speaker 2:  about specs. This is just a, this is who we are now.

94
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I feel great about it. This year's holiday spectacular

95
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,040
Speaker 5:  For giving a gift to our listeners.

96
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,480
Speaker 2:  I think it's that the joke spectacular is too good to

97
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,280
Speaker 2:  pass up. Yes,

98
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,400
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent.

99
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,320
Speaker 2:  Like in our heart of hearts it's, can I let our producer

100
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,120
Speaker 2:  Andrew Marino do slay bell sounds while we talk about

101
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,600
Speaker 2:  Bluetooth? And the answer is yes.

102
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,360
Speaker 6:  Have we started a new standards group to establish how this will happen?

103
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,160
Speaker 6:  What is the name of

104
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,400
Speaker 2:  It? Spectacular Standards Group. So we've got a, a holiday

105
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,280
Speaker 2:  spectacular. It's about Bluetooth, this year's holiday spectacular. It's

106
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,600
Speaker 2:  about Bluetooth. We've got

107
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,080
Speaker 2:  discussion of the Bluetooth standard. We

108
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,600
Speaker 2:  have holiday sound effects. And my friends, we have

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,800
Speaker 2:  Bluetooth Jeopardy, which we have already recorded, I can tell you is one

110
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,600
Speaker 2:  of the most chaotic, I'm incredible, 45 minutes of verge cast

111
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
Speaker 2:  history ever put to tape. Liam thought it was gonna take 30 minutes

112
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,400
Speaker 2:  and we recorded for 90. And I'm just guessing they managed to

113
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,640
Speaker 2:  cut that down to 45.

114
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,880
Speaker 5:  They can't cut a single thing every minute of it was perfect.

115
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,280
Speaker 2:  I'll just, I'll just tell you right now. Bluetooth jeopardy is shockingly

116
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,560
Speaker 2:  hard. It is so much harder than you think and I can't wait for you to listen

117
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,200
Speaker 2:  to it. So that's coming out on December 21st. That'll be good.

118
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,560
Speaker 2:  And then actually the biggest news of this week is the fusion

119
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,000
Speaker 2:  breakthrough where a bunch of researchers with the Lawrence

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,960
Speaker 2:  Livermore National Laboratory created a fusion reaction, but basically shooting

121
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,520
Speaker 2:  lasers at something that produced more energy than it took to cause the

122
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,520
Speaker 2:  reaction. That's a very big deal, does not get mean free

123
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,120
Speaker 2:  energy, but it's like, it's one of those breakthrough scientific moments

124
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,320
Speaker 2:  we're not gonna talk about in this episode because our excellent science

125
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,160
Speaker 2:  reporter, Justine Comma, is actually interviewing some of the scientists

126
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,960
Speaker 2:  and will have an episode with them coming up very soon as

127
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,680
Speaker 2:  well. So that's really exciting. Just a lot of verge cast stuff to close

128
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,160
Speaker 2:  out the year, including the holiday spectacular

129
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,440
Speaker 2:  about Bluetooth, which I I'm gonna tell you is just one of the

130
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,400
Speaker 2:  finest pieces of technology journalism ever made, ever. Even though we

131
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,480
Speaker 2:  have not made two thirds VI yet

132
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,520
Speaker 5:  Is amazing. Jeopardy.

133
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,280
Speaker 2:  Here's what I think. And if you are a Pulitzer voter,

134
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,000
Speaker 2:  keep this in mind. More journalism should be in the form of jeopardy.

135
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,480
Speaker 5:  I I think, I think it's right because like what are you doing? Someone is,

136
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,920
Speaker 5:  is making a statement and then you're asking a question. You're asking,

137
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,040
Speaker 5:  that's journalism baby. We're doing it. It's true.

138
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,800
Speaker 2:  If also if you are a lawyer with the Jeopardy people,

139
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,480
Speaker 2:  please stop listening to this and turn it off your phone, out the window.

140
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,600
Speaker 5:  Delete us from your feed.

141
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,480
Speaker 2:  You didn't hear any of this Lawyers, the Jeopardy people. Anyway,

142
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,920
Speaker 2:  holiday spectacular Bluetooth coming Fusion episode of Justine coming.

143
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,080
Speaker 2:  And then on video side we have an Apple Watch Ultra

144
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,960
Speaker 2:  Review that's coming next week. It is one of the most over

145
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,920
Speaker 2:  the top videos we have ever made. The video team went all out because

146
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,840
Speaker 2:  how else do you review the Apple Watch Ultra and video. You gotta go do a

147
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,880
Speaker 2:  bunch of stuff. And we have a little note from Becca talking about that.

148
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,760
Speaker 2:  Let's listen to Becca.

149
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,600
Speaker 7:  Hey, it's me, Becca, Versace. Listen, my question for you

150
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,160
Speaker 7:  is, have you heard that I have been working on this honestly

151
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,080
Speaker 7:  insane review of the Apple Watch Ultra because the rumors are true.

152
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,200
Speaker 7:  I have, we have Dove down 130 feet with this watch

153
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,040
Speaker 7:  off the coast of California. We've gotten lost in Yosemite

154
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,760
Speaker 7:  and well, we have people that have been wearing it around New York City for

155
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,360
Speaker 7:  months now and we are doing the most in-depth review that we've ever done.

156
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,960
Speaker 7:  And y'all better check it out. Okay. Especially you David Pierce.

157
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,720
Speaker 7:  Anyway, check it out bud youtube.com/verge.

00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,680
Speaker 7:  That's all I got.

159
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,380
Speaker 2:  Alright. I am theoretically responsible for everything that happens here

160
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,900
Speaker 2:  at the Verge. Legitimately afraid about this video.

161
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,660
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm excited about it.

162
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,900
Speaker 2:  No, I'm excited in the way that like, getting arrested is exciting.

163
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,320
Speaker 2:  This is gonna be great. It's gonna be a good time. So that's coming. Apple

164
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,040
Speaker 2:  watch Ultra Videos coming next week. Bluetooth spectaculars coming next week,

167
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,520
Speaker 2:  it's time to take a break. That's why we made holidays Spectacular for you.

168
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,360
Speaker 2:  Okay, that's all the business. Oh, that's outta the way. Let's talk about

169
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,240
Speaker 2:  some news. I feel like we gotta start with spf. I feel like we gotta

170
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,840
Speaker 2:  start with crypto. We can, we can do it quickly. Richard, you

171
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,560
Speaker 6:  Were there. It's always time to start with crypto. I told you 2023, I'm becoming

172
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:26,840
Speaker 6:  a big

173
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,720
Speaker 2:  Crypto guy. Tell me what is going on the, by the way, we had this conversation

174
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,400
Speaker 2:  like last week or the week before where we're like, should you interview

175
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,320
Speaker 2:  Sam Bankman Fried? Is that journalism? And it's like, oh yeah, my

176
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,520
Speaker 2:  dude talks so much, he's going to jail.

177
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,080
Speaker 6:  This guy just couldn't stop doing interviews. I was trying to track the interviews

178
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,640
Speaker 6:  that he was doing. I, I was gonna write up some of them, but he just kept

179
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,560
Speaker 6:  doing more. And every time I would, I would take a look at him, say, oh,

180
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,800
Speaker 6:  well just kill a couple interesting things here. He was always live doing

181
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,320
Speaker 6:  another interview as I was thinking about it, write up

182
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,080
Speaker 6:  until he was arrested in The Bahamas now,

183
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,480
Speaker 2:  Right? Until he did his final interview to the police.

184
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Now he's giving very different interviews than en unfortunately are

185
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,520
Speaker 6:  not live streamed. But yes, he has been arrested in The Bahamas. In case

186
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,560
Speaker 6:  you were wondering over the last month after FTX collapsed and they discovered

187
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,240
Speaker 6:  that everyone's money wasn't there like it was supposed to be. It, it happened

188
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,600
Speaker 6:  pretty quickly. I think in comparison as our colleague Liz Pao pointed out,

189
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,320
Speaker 6:  he was arrested a little bit more quickly than Elizabeth Holmes was when

190
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,240
Speaker 6:  Theranos started to go down. And if you've been watching the amount of money

191
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,200
Speaker 6:  that he's responsible for that appears to not be there anymore,

192
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,440
Speaker 6:  is quite a bit more than what the

193
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,880
Speaker 6:  Elizabeth Holmes was, was basically convicted of stealing. So

194
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,440
Speaker 6:  assuming it gets to that point, you can, you can imagine what the possible

195
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,080
Speaker 6:  sentence could be. But let's, let's run it back. Let's just see what happened

196
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,320
Speaker 6:  in November. In kind of mid-November ftx, the second biggest

197
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,040
Speaker 6:  crypto exchange in the world collapsed. Suddenly there was a run

198
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,960
Speaker 6:  on the bank. People tried to get their money out and there was no more money.

199
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,400
Speaker 6:  Pretty ver very quickly. And no one knew what was happening.

200
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,960
Speaker 6:  There was a supposed buyout by the largest crypto

201
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,000
Speaker 6:  exchange Binance. They looked at the books quickly backed off. Fast forward

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,320
Speaker 6:  to now, all the regulators, all of the celebrities, everyone who used to

203
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,440
Speaker 6:  be Sam Bankman Free's friend when he was a billionaire, are now running from

204
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,480
Speaker 6:  ftx. They're now pointing the finger and saying that this guy lied. He's

205
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,720
Speaker 6:  everything wrong. And they can't really explain why they didn't see these

206
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,680
Speaker 6:  lies before. But that, that's where we are now. And now we've,

207
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,120
Speaker 6:  we have all of his interviews and we're also getting kind of the, the investigations

208
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,440
Speaker 6:  that have been going on, especially over the last month. We're finding out

209
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,680
Speaker 6:  more, we're finding out real hard information because it's coming out in

210
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,040
Speaker 6:  the bankruptcy filings. It's coming out now in the civil charges and the

211
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,840
Speaker 6:  criminal charges that have been file that been file been filed against Bankman

212
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,760
Speaker 6:  Freed. And it's, it's not good. We found out that a couple of days before

213
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,000
Speaker 6:  the bankruptcy happened, one of his, the executives at F T X was telling

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,760
Speaker 6:  the Bahamian authorities that Bankman Fried had moved

215
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,880
Speaker 6:  money that was supposed to be customer funds to his own research firm,

216
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,920
Speaker 6:  Alameda. Which if that is true, then that would be probably a crime.

217
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,160
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's it. That's just jail. Yeah, like that, that's just

218
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,440
Speaker 2:  a you spot a ticket to jail.

219
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,880
Speaker 6:  So yeah, there's kind of a long list of criminal activities that have been

220
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,240
Speaker 6:  going on and, and we've got breakdowns of the many lies that he's told in

221
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,000
Speaker 6:  the, the charges that he's facing in, in every, everything that's going on.

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,600
Speaker 6:  But I've been living the Sam Bankman free interview, life, life

223
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,560
Speaker 6:  for the last few weeks. I, I no longer know what is true or where I am. When,

224
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,720
Speaker 6:  when you guys are looking at this, like what do you see for the case? What,

225
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,000
Speaker 6:  what are you wondering about?

226
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,240
Speaker 5:  Is Tom Brady going to jail?

227
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,440
Speaker 2:  I mean, so a bunch of influencers have been hit with lawsuits. There's a

228
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,400
Speaker 2:  class action lawsuit against a bunch of celebrities, including our boy Tommy,

229
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,880
Speaker 2:  who probably needs to win another Super Bowl just to

230
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,280
Speaker 2:  get a piece of his heart back.

231
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,320
Speaker 2:  I dunno if that's gonna go well for him. I feel like we have to mention that

232
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,120
Speaker 2:  the fact that Tom Brady destroyed his life over Sam Mankin Fried and ftx

233
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,080
Speaker 2:  every single episode,

234
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,240
Speaker 5:  Every single episode.

235
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,200
Speaker 2:  I, you know, here's what I worry about and then what I'm, what I've been

236
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,120
Speaker 2:  thinking about this whole thing is a Ponzi scheme, right? Even their ads,

237
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,000
Speaker 2:  even if you just go back and look at that super ride with Larry David, the

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,640
Speaker 2:  ad is about not being left out, which is like

239
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,520
Speaker 2:  the classic Ponzi scheme thing to advertise. It's a pretty good

240
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,360
Speaker 2:  sense. It's like, are you in, like, can you get in at the bottom of the period

241
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,240
Speaker 2:  so the people at the top of your earning cash out? And if you just create

242
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,160
Speaker 2:  that sense of fomo, like the Ponzi scheme will sustain itself

243
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,320
Speaker 2:  a little bit longer. It was never about utility. It was never about what

244
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,560
Speaker 2:  you could do with crypto. And at the end of the day, like what you can do

245
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,360
Speaker 2:  with crypto is still mostly crimes.

246
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,040
Speaker 2:  Like it's basically crimes.

247
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,120
Speaker 6:  Some of them are gambling.

248
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,280
Speaker 5:  You can buy a coffee from like a coffee house in Austin takes

249
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,800
Speaker 5:  Bitcoin.

250
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,040
Speaker 2:  Yeah, the coffee house. I'm sure that coffee house is connected to crimes

251
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,640
Speaker 2:  in some way. I don't know if that's true. Again, if you are a lawyer with,

252
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,320
Speaker 2:  at this point, either Jeopardy or a Austin

253
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,200
Speaker 2:  Coffee House, just stop listening.

254
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,320
Speaker 5:  I didn't name it. It's fine. Yeah. Who knows. Nobody knows which one it is.

255
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,240
Speaker 2:  But like fundamentally the utility of crypto is, is more

256
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,640
Speaker 2:  related to crime than not. Yeah. And there's this

257
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,560
Speaker 2:  piece of the puzzle where all the people who are still in crypto,

258
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,080
Speaker 2:  all the investors, all the technologists, Brian Armstrong from Coinbase,

259
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,320
Speaker 2:  they're like, Sam Bankman, Fried's a liar. No one should be talking to

260
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,160
Speaker 2:  him anymore. Every time he talks, he just makes us all look bad. He pulls

261
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,480
Speaker 2:  the all over people's eyes, journalists are too credible, blah blah blah.

262
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,160
Speaker 2:  He's like, get him in jail so he can move on with our lives. And I think

263
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,280
Speaker 2:  what they're failing to see is there's

264
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,120
Speaker 2:  still no more utility there. And actually putting

265
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,840
Speaker 2:  someone in jail is not easy to do.

266
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,840
Speaker 2:  Right. Like proving a financial crime of this scale

267
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,800
Speaker 2:  past a reasonable doubt and actually winning the

268
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,640
Speaker 2:  case with the lawyers that you know, he's gonna be able

269
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,520
Speaker 2:  to put together and the defenses he'll mount and just the cloud

270
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,480
Speaker 2:  of obfuscation that he'll put together is, it's

271
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,280
Speaker 2:  gonna take a long time. And I think there's this immediate rush to

272
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,440
Speaker 2:  judgment in all of this. Like, he's a fraudster, he should go to jail.

273
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,360
Speaker 2:  Let's close this chapter of crypto history and move on

274
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,960
Speaker 2:  to the next thing, which is not clear,

275
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,960
Speaker 2:  but let's move on to it as fast as we can.

276
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,760
Speaker 6:  Let, let me mention one of my favorite parts of this is that the fall of

277
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,720
Speaker 6:  Sam Nkf Fried and FTX has brought back all of our fields crypto friends

278
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,520
Speaker 6:  from years past Mark Polis who ran Mountain GOs, a

279
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,880
Speaker 6:  crypto exchange that failed in, what was that, 2015 Now that was many years

280
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,120
Speaker 6:  ago. One, one of the first big crypto failures of exchanges that went away

281
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
Speaker 6:  and took away everyone's money with it. He's been tweeting endlessly about

282
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,080
Speaker 6:  it. He's been giving advice to Sam Bang Fried about what he should do

283
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,760
Speaker 6:  and how, how mostly he shouldn't talk to anyone. He should only talk to his

284
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,160
Speaker 6:  lawyers. Yeah. And he would know because he has been there and he is,

285
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,600
Speaker 5:  I have a question. Yes. Are there any exchanges, crypto

286
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,160
Speaker 5:  exchanges that are not Ponzi schemes?

287
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,880
Speaker 6:  I don't know how to legally answer that.

288
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,080
Speaker 5:  Like, because all of them basically, they take your money and then they say,

289
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,680
Speaker 5:  now our money grew bigger and we'll give you your money back. But like

290
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,480
Speaker 5:  is the cat is is the US dollar wait,

291
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,080
Speaker 2:  You, is that, wait, are you describing the exchanges of the tokens?

292
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,000
Speaker 5:  The exchanges? Like the exchanges.

293
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,480
Speaker 6:  The exchanges themselves? Are they, because

294
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,320
Speaker 5:  All Ponzi schemes

295
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,120
Speaker 6:  There, there's this weird thing in crypto, like the way that we talk about

296
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,480
Speaker 6:  crypto and the way that people who are in it who, or feel like they're in

297
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,360
Speaker 6:  it, like the real players in crypto talk about it are very different. Yeah.

298
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,440
Speaker 6:  Like we talk about cryptocurrency and some kind of theoretical things. The

299
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,960
Speaker 6:  people who are there, who are trying to make some money, who are, who are

300
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,280
Speaker 6:  looking at it and saying, this is going to be my nest egg. This is how I'm

301
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,480
Speaker 6:  going to get rich. They have bought some crypto, they've traded back and

302
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,960
Speaker 6:  forth. They, they own different cryptocurrencies. They have it all in their

303
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,400
Speaker 6:  wallet and they're trying to turn it into something bigger. And what many

304
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,680
Speaker 6:  of these companies offer is, okay, so you can loan, you can give us your

305
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,560
Speaker 6:  crypto and we'll store it and we will somehow increase the value

306
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,520
Speaker 6:  of it. We will do some magical thing, which sounds a lot like, I don't

307
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,120
Speaker 6:  know Bernie Madoff. And then there will be more money and they promise, right?

308
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,520
Speaker 2:  And they all have their own tokens. I think that that's where you're getting

309
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,760
Speaker 2:  at, right? Like ftx,

310
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,720
Speaker 6:  That's, that's where the magical money comes from. When, when you, when you

311
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,080
Speaker 6:  start talking about pay to earn stuff, when you talk, start talking about

312
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,440
Speaker 6:  practically everything and Web three said these companies have their own

313
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,040
Speaker 6:  tokens and that's where they're like, okay, so that's where the money's going

314
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,240
Speaker 6:  to come from. But actually the money comes from other people depositing more

315
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,960
Speaker 6:  money in it. And that's how you can get your money out. Which would

316
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,880
Speaker 5:  Probably be a scheme just kind of feels like they probably need to

317
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,720
Speaker 5:  address that more than even the utility thing.

318
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,200
Speaker 6:  If they address that, they wouldn't have businesses.

319
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,600
Speaker 2:  Right? Cuz they, the utility thing is way hard to address. Like, I just wanna

320
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,560
Speaker 2:  point at, I mentioned Brian Armstrong from Coinbase before and he

321
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,320
Speaker 2:  seems like a smart guy. You know, he's out there, he's public.

322
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,480
Speaker 2:  He even interviewed to our friend Ben Thompson trajectory this past week.

323
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,320
Speaker 2:  It's a good interview. You should read it. It's a lot regulation where come

324
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,400
Speaker 2:  from, who should do it, da da da. But there's this section in it where he's

325
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,240
Speaker 2:  like, all the journalists failed at interviewing SPF F and

326
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,440
Speaker 2:  so Ben is journalist. And I was like, all right, you be the journalist. What

327
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,040
Speaker 2:  question would you ask? How would you defeat SPF F in interview?

328
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,800
Speaker 2:  And like, you know, I don't wanna get too in the weeds or like Naval gaze

329
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,640
Speaker 2:  you about journalism, but like I, I interview people. I, it's like

330
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,400
Speaker 2:  you, if you approach an interview, like you're gonna win it. Like most people

331
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,440
Speaker 2:  A will not talk to you. And B, also what are you gonna win? Like you're not

332
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,760
Speaker 2:  the cops. Like you can just get people to talk to you as

333
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,280
Speaker 2:  openly as they can and like people can judge the answers. But Ben asks him,

334
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,120
Speaker 2:  okay, you're the journalist, so you have all these criticism of media, like

335
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,080
Speaker 2:  what would you ask? And Brian Armstrong's answer is like, I got nothing left

336
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,960
Speaker 2:  to ask this guy. Like we just need to move on. And it's like, well that's

337
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,600
Speaker 2:  the trap, right? Like you just don't want people to scrutinize

338
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,240
Speaker 2:  the fact that all these exchanges are mostly

339
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,440
Speaker 2:  unregulated. You all hated Gary Anser and the S E C and all these

340
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,040
Speaker 2:  other like regulators would be regulators for even daring to think that they

341
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,880
Speaker 2:  should regulate you. And now the thing happened that

342
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,720
Speaker 2:  happens to unregulated financial institutions and

343
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,840
Speaker 2:  you're like, where were the regulators? Why didn't they see these obvious

344
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,160
Speaker 2:  lies?

345
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,280
Speaker 6:  I mean, I've got a question.

346
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,400
Speaker 2:  I think, wait, I just like, until you break that cycle, this this is

347
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,440
Speaker 2:  always gonna feel scam to me.

348
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,720
Speaker 6:  And I know what he could ask Sam Bankman fried, he could ask, why is it that

349
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,440
Speaker 6:  every time there's a run on your business and people try to get their money

350
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,400
Speaker 6:  out, suddenly your site crashes when people can't get money out that day.

351
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,560
Speaker 6:  I'm sorry, that's a question about Coinbase that I would ask to Brian Armstrong

352
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,840
Speaker 6:  if he would answer it. He for some reason hasn't.

353
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,800
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's pretty, it's weird. It's pretty shaky. It's super weird. All right,

354
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,200
Speaker 2:  we gotta stop talking about crypto. That is like the big news. It's in the

355
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,160
Speaker 2:  background. I'm actually curious to ask the audience this. We got comments

356
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,720
Speaker 2:  on the, on quick post down our site. So when you see this, go find the ver

357
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,360
Speaker 2:  on our site. Leave us comments cuz I want people to engage with us on our

358
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,880
Speaker 2:  own site. I think part of the crypto story is partially tech, right? It's

359
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,680
Speaker 2:  obviously a technology story in its way, but it is quickly becoming

360
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,720
Speaker 2:  some other kind of story. It's quickly becoming a bank regulation

361
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,680
Speaker 2:  story or I don't know, like a politics story,

362
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,080
Speaker 2:  a financial system story. So I'm just curious how people

363
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,760
Speaker 2:  want us to cover it because for the longest time we could cover crypto as

364
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,480
Speaker 2:  tech, right? It was like really interesting tech with massive sociopolitical

365
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,560
Speaker 2:  implications. Like verge strike zone stuff, right? Yeah. And now we're just

366
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,200
Speaker 2:  at the level of like, oh, this guy's just stole money. Like he's,

367
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,040
Speaker 2:  he's just a bank robber. There's like not actually a

368
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,000
Speaker 6:  Lot there. The CEO of FTX said in one of the hearings in Congress

369
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,600
Speaker 6:  this week, just, this is just good old fashioned crime. They they just stole

370
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,560
Speaker 6:  the money. They just took, they just had the money and they just took it

371
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,880
Speaker 6:  and spent it themselves. It's not, you don't have to like try and figure

372
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,600
Speaker 6:  out what the algorithm did. They just took the money and you bought jets

373
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,880
Speaker 6:  and houses and stuff. Yeah.

374
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,880
Speaker 5:  At least Elizabeth Holmes went and she built something. Was it

375
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,560
Speaker 5:  good? Did it work? No, she,

376
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,240
Speaker 2:  No, that did. She built something,

377
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,200
Speaker 2:  she took a, she took another device from another company that

378
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,840
Speaker 2:  worked, took it apart, made it work in a shittier way

379
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,240
Speaker 6:  And gave people bad results on important medical tests.

380
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,520
Speaker 2:  So I dunno about that one. Also, she, I mean she's going to jail. The other

381
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,400
Speaker 2:  guy's gonna jail. A lot of people go to jail. The one part of this that is

382
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,200
Speaker 2:  extremely a verge story. Yeah. Like the most verge story

383
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,320
Speaker 2:  is like the new CEO of FDX is like testifying in in the Senate

384
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,440
Speaker 2:  and he's just like, they fucking use QuickBooks. He's just ex

385
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,080
Speaker 2:  horrified.

386
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,560
Speaker 2:  He's like, what business at this scale uses QuickBooks? And he's just like

387
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,680
Speaker 2:  gesturing it like the panel of senators and the senators have no

388
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,520
Speaker 2:  idea. Like they don't know. They're like, is QuickBooks bad?

389
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,200
Speaker 5:  They're like, I use it for my taxes.

390
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,280
Speaker 2:  It's very good all at that moment also on our site, just go

391
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,120
Speaker 2:  watch it. It's, I mean it is incredible. Okay, so that's SPF F FTX

392
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,760
Speaker 2:  will, whatever other big news from this week, it's kind of in the same

393
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,400
Speaker 2:  zone, right? Like big breaking news would change the whole industry hasn't

394
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,440
Speaker 2:  happened yet. Hard to talk about. It's this report from Markman, Bloomberg

395
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,400
Speaker 2:  Apple might be opening iOS to third party app stores

396
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,640
Speaker 2:  in response to European legislation called the Digital Markets Act.

397
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,040
Speaker 2:  This is another one of those European regulations that is

398
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,520
Speaker 2:  like an inc blot test for how you feel about the

399
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,560
Speaker 2:  power of democracy to regulate big companies. And also an ink block test

400
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,040
Speaker 2:  for how you might feel about the nature of time and deadlines

401
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,920
Speaker 2:  because no one knows when it will actually happen or by which process

402
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,120
Speaker 2:  the various nations of Europe will come together and actually implement the

403
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,320
Speaker 2:  law that they have theoretically passed or not passed or

404
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,200
Speaker 2:  in some manner of, of working have assembled words

405
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:11,680
Speaker 2:  together.

406
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,640
Speaker 2:  The the EU is just the cutting edge of politics in

407
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,120
Speaker 2:  just the, it's like a probabilistic field of lawyers

408
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,640
Speaker 2:  and like every potential outcome is happening,

409
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,800
Speaker 2:  but no one knows when

410
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,800
Speaker 5:  I like that they kind of like create laws. Like I assign stories

411
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,040
Speaker 5:  just like, you know what, I got an idea run with it. And a

412
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,400
Speaker 5:  bunch of like a billion people are like, okay, it's great.

413
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But, but yeah. Walk us, walk us through this DEI cuz like

414
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,560
Speaker 5:  this Apple news, I mean I I think it feels kind of big even though there's

415
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,000
Speaker 5:  the whole question of how any of this law and stuff is gonna be

416
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,240
Speaker 5:  enacted.

417
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So the Digital Markets act is one of these things we've been covering

418
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,040
Speaker 2:  for a long time. Yeah. Again, we've been covering it sporadically as different

419
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,920
Speaker 2:  parts of the regulation get debated, added to the law. Law has

420
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,040
Speaker 2:  to pass, the member nations of the EU themselves have to pass the law, but

421
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,760
Speaker 2:  it is supposed to happen in 2024. And the DMA

422
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,600
Speaker 2:  is, it tracks along a lot of the antitrust bills

423
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,520
Speaker 2:  in this country. You can see that the sort of two legal regimes are

424
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,360
Speaker 2:  playing off of each other. Yeah. And the basics, I, the basic ideas

425
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,840
Speaker 2:  are gonna be familiar to any VIR listener. If you have a dominant

426
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,960
Speaker 2:  position on, if you run an app store or you're another kind of

427
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,000
Speaker 2:  dominant ecosystem player, you are a gatekeeper to all kinds of other businesses.

428
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,320
Speaker 2:  And so app stores in particular, apple and Google are the gatekeepers

429
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,200
Speaker 2:  they are referred to in the act as gatekeepers. And there's all

430
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,640
Speaker 2:  the things that gatekeepers have to do to open up the markets.

431
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,840
Speaker 2:  And so in this case, it's allowed side loading, allow other app stores,

432
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,200
Speaker 2:  it's reduced the in-app payment fees. There's this laundry list, it actually

433
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,000
Speaker 2:  has to happen. And just like the U S P C thing, apple

434
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,560
Speaker 2:  has no choice. If they wanna sell iPhones in Europe, they've

435
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,160
Speaker 2:  gotta comply with the law, right? There's no, they can't

436
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,480
Speaker 2:  send bankman freedom.

437
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,640
Speaker 2:  So it, it's, it seems likely probable

438
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,040
Speaker 2:  a certainty that Apple is building systems that would bring it

439
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,040
Speaker 2:  into compliance with European law. Just like is it a certainty? And we've

440
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,240
Speaker 2:  heard Greg Jos say to Joanna Stern, for example, that yeah, they're gonna

441
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,960
Speaker 2:  comply with the law around us bbc, right? So of course there were of,

442
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,760
Speaker 2:  there's been an iPhone with a U SBC connector inside of an Apple lab for

443
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,000
Speaker 2:  a decade, right? They, they, they're always ready to do these things.

444
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,320
Speaker 2:  But I think what is happening now is Europe in particular is passing the

445
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,520
Speaker 2:  laws to make the things happen. So next year we might see an actual iPhone

446
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,960
Speaker 2:  ship with a U SBC connector and next year's version of iOS

447
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,040
Speaker 2:  will at least have the hooks to allow compliance with the digital

448
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,560
Speaker 2:  markets act in Europe, allow side loading, allow other AppSource, allow other

449
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,320
Speaker 2:  payment systems. The questions are,

450
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,200
Speaker 2:  does that actually mean Apple's gonna stop demanding the money from

451
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,000
Speaker 2:  the app companies? Because that has not been the case in all the other markets,

452
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,160
Speaker 2:  right? In South Korea where they're required to allow other in-app payment

453
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,120
Speaker 2:  systems. They charge a fee in the Netherlands where it's like narrowly

454
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,040
Speaker 2:  tailored to dating apps and they have to allow other payment providers, some

455
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,360
Speaker 2:  dating apps. Very strange. They charge 27%.

456
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,800
Speaker 2:  Addie and McKenna have written a piece about this for our site a couple weeks

457
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,320
Speaker 2:  ago, which we mentioned on the show, you can do the culture war. Elon can

458
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,200
Speaker 2:  do the culture war, get the antitrust bill passed because he's was mad

459
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,680
Speaker 2:  at Tim Cook. But Apple is just gonna say, we, you owe us the money. Yeah.

460
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,800
Speaker 2:  In one way or another, Apple's gonna get its money. They're, they're good

461
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,720
Speaker 2:  at it. Tim Cook is good at it. So, we'll the big questions around the EU

462
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,040
Speaker 2:  bill and the DMA and all this stuff is, is the bill written

463
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,840
Speaker 2:  in a way that closes whatever loopholes Apple might find? Yeah.

464
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,360
Speaker 2:  And just the complication of European law

465
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,320
Speaker 2:  is such that I can't even tell you when this bill's gonna pass,

466
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,840
Speaker 2:  let alone whether all the loopholes are closed. Like if they

467
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,040
Speaker 6:  Have to do it, will it apply? If you don't live in Europe, will will We have

468
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,480
Speaker 6:  two versions of iOS suddenly?

469
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,920
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean that's another one, right? Will Apple keep the, the phone locked

470
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,800
Speaker 2:  down in other countries? Now the EU says the latest date

471
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,880
Speaker 2:  gatekeeper companies have to comply is March 6th, 2024.

472
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,840
Speaker 2:  But there's like a gated series of other

473
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,960
Speaker 2:  compliance dates about notifying regulators and

474
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,920
Speaker 2:  disclosing your changes. There's a lot of moments to

475
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,640
Speaker 2:  argue along the way for Apple. And then there's this

476
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,840
Speaker 2:  important piece of the puzzle, which is, you might do this in Europe, but

477
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,520
Speaker 2:  you might definitely not allow this United States or China or

478
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,320
Speaker 2:  your other big markets. And I, that to me is gonna be the, the most

479
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,360
Speaker 2:  interesting piece. Like are we gonna start doing like region locked iPhones

480
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,880
Speaker 2:  like we used to do, like VHS tapes or whatever? Yes. Like, or, or Nintendo

481
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,280
Speaker 2:  games. Oh my gosh. Are there going to be, are there gonna be apps

482
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:51,520
Speaker 2:  that have more capabilities outside of the United States because they don't

483
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,080
Speaker 2:  have to go through Apple's App Store rules? Is that gonna be a good experience

484
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,840
Speaker 2:  for people? Like I, I have long thought that Apple has sort of

485
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,080
Speaker 2:  tamped down on innovation on its phone because of the app store

486
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,880
Speaker 2:  process. I think they should open it up. But I, I've, I

487
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,440
Speaker 2:  have lived through a mobile phone market where there were multiple competing

488
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,920
Speaker 2:  app stores in independent distributions of apps.

489
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,960
Speaker 2:  That wasn't great. Shout out to my, my friend Dieter Bone who like made an

490
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,880
Speaker 2:  entire documentary about, about handspring. Like that wasn't a great

491
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,760
Speaker 2:  market for those early phones. And Apple actually did innovate by doing the

492
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,560
Speaker 2:  app store. So there are questions to be asked here. I was just thinking in

493
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,440
Speaker 2:  a world where Microsoft can't ship game streaming, cuz Apple won't let

494
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,400
Speaker 2:  them Yeah. We might be losing more than we're gaining by the Apple's control

495
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:36,880
Speaker 2:  of the store.

496
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, I think we're definitely gonna get region locked iPhones. I

497
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,320
Speaker 5:  think that's like we, we all just need to like make our peace with it. Now

498
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,280
Speaker 5:  we're gonna be importing our phones from Europe so we can have the really

499
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,960
Speaker 5:  good phones. It's always gonna be a nightmare. Like we're finally out of

500
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,440
Speaker 5:  that phase where you had to really think about what network you were on when

501
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,560
Speaker 5:  you bought your iPhone. And we're just gonna go right back to having that

502
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,840
Speaker 5:  weird little question of, okay, do I buy it unlocked from the US

503
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,840
Speaker 5:  or really unlocked from Norway?

504
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,320
Speaker 6:  I think that we're not gonna have so much the hardware difference, which

505
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,240
Speaker 6:  was just a software difference. So now I got a VPN into Luxembourg

506
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,280
Speaker 6:  so that I can play Fortnite on my iPhone.

507
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,560
Speaker 5:  I'm, and that

508
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:19,880
Speaker 2:  Sounds hot.

509
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,520
Speaker 5:  We're gonna be back to like jail breaking, right? Like in, but

510
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,400
Speaker 5:  instead of jail breaking, just so we can sign stuff onto our things, we're

511
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,840
Speaker 5:  gonna be like, okay, now I'm in Europe and that's just gonna

512
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,920
Speaker 2:  Be your phone. Yeah. The VPN market's gonna explode. Yeah, it's gonna be

513
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,880
Speaker 2:  great. I just, I the phones know where they are. Right? At the end of the

514
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,760
Speaker 2:  day, the phone has a GPS trip and Apple can, can, can read it whatever it

515
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,560
Speaker 2:  wants. And I, I that is, I think that's the big question

516
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,320
Speaker 2:  mark here. There is the other question mark about the nature of the EU

517
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,200
Speaker 2:  regulatory process, which I just, I don't wanna, I don't

518
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,760
Speaker 2:  wanna underemphasize Yeah. Just how nebulous all of it is,

519
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,200
Speaker 2:  but it makes sense that Apple's preparing to comply with it. It's just, is

520
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,920
Speaker 2:  it gonna be effective? Is it gonna mean anything to us here? Is the

521
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,800
Speaker 2:  United States gonna take the cover of this happening, of

522
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,720
Speaker 2:  this report and shove some antitrust stuff into this omnibus bill

523
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,560
Speaker 2:  that appears to be passing in the lame duck session That Congress isn't that

524
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,720
Speaker 2:  like all these things have happened?

525
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,800
Speaker 5:  Oh, I hope they don't, I mean, I want like antitrust stuff, but

526
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,480
Speaker 5:  I don't want it shoved in at the last minute into an omnibus bill that just

527
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,440
Speaker 5:  seems unpleasant. Just

528
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,800
Speaker 2:  You have like a stylistic difference.

529
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's like, it's like now I have to like read this whole bill because

530
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,440
Speaker 5:  what if there's more than one part of it? Like, that's too many words for

531
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,680
Speaker 5:  me to read. It's Christmas.

532
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:41,760
Speaker 2:  Well, good news is we have a high-end Pol policy desk with

533
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,840
Speaker 2:  McKenna Addie to, to read it for you. Thank you guys. That happens. There's

534
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,640
Speaker 2:  just rumors that might happen. Yeah. But I, you can see right now how the

535
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,560
Speaker 2:  United States in Europe are kind of bouncing back and forth on

536
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,360
Speaker 2:  antitrust stuff, particularly regulating the big tie companies in, I, I think

537
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,320
Speaker 2:  Elon has provided more cover for antitrust stuff in to

538
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,080
Speaker 2:  Apple because of the perceived content moderation issues at the store

539
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:07,720
Speaker 2:  than ever before. Right. And you can see how you might scoot some

540
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,440
Speaker 2:  antitrust stuff along because you've got the cover of now both Europe

541
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,520
Speaker 2:  doing it, right. It's already gonna happen anyway over there and you've got

542
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,680
Speaker 2:  the cover of being whatever kind of free speech warrior you think that you're

543
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,200
Speaker 2:  being. Yeah.

544
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,880
Speaker 5:  But I, I think like my, my one concern there is that the G O P has

545
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,720
Speaker 5:  historically been like, yeah, we're for antitrust, but only when it can,

546
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,240
Speaker 5:  only when it like pertains to censorship.

547
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,320
Speaker 5:  Otherwise you can build as big a monopoly as you want. And so

548
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,960
Speaker 5:  I just don't, I don't know, I'm real reluctant with our current

549
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,080
Speaker 5:  congress and their inability to like parse a lot of tech, like

550
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,040
Speaker 5:  really technologically advanced concepts to create, create

551
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,960
Speaker 5:  a a bill with actual teeth to

552
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,400
Speaker 2:  It. Yeah. And that's why they're gonna shove it into a bill at the end of

553
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,120
Speaker 2:  the year and call it a day like, oh,

554
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,320
Speaker 5:  It's

555
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,680
Speaker 2:  Gonna be gross. I think that's why those rumors are out there. Well, I don't

556
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,440
Speaker 2:  know if it's gonna happen. It's just those are the rumors. Yeah. Actually,

557
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,880
Speaker 2:  speaking of Elon, we should talk about Elon quickly before, before I take

558
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,840
Speaker 2:  a break. As always, there's a lot of Elon stuff, most notably Twitter.

559
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,600
Speaker 2:  Blue is back Elon caved to

560
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,880
Speaker 2:  Apple. It's 1199 on iOS. It's

561
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,680
Speaker 2:  8 99 on the web, 7 99 on the web. So he's used

562
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,600
Speaker 2:  paying the Apple tax. Yeah. Even after raging about it, he's

563
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,000
Speaker 2:  paying it. There's the check marks are different colors. I think The Verge

564
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,680
Speaker 2:  has a gold one because we're a media organization. Government

565
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,080
Speaker 2:  organizations get a gray check mark that says official.

566
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,320
Speaker 2:  I will note here that a deeply hilarious

567
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,200
Speaker 2:  situation over the past week is that various

568
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,400
Speaker 2:  members of the Norwegian government, including the Prime Minister, were labeled

569
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,200
Speaker 2:  as Nigerian government officials and just

570
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,000
Speaker 2:  tweeted Elon. And he eventually was like, sorry. And they fixed it. And when

571
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,480
Speaker 2:  I say for a while it was like a day and a half and they were just like, this

572
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:50,840
Speaker 2:  isn't,

573
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,880
Speaker 5:  This is not where we live. This is not where we do our

574
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,600
Speaker 2:  Work. The tweet was very funny. It was very much like, although we enjoy

575
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,440
Speaker 2:  our diplomatic relations ship in alphabetical proximity to Nigeria,

576
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,400
Speaker 2:  we do not live in Nigeria. That's going great. It's back. We'll

577
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,080
Speaker 2:  see how it goes. A lot of people have stepped back their Twitter usage

578
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,440
Speaker 2:  in the past few weeks. Yeah. I'm one of them. Our friend Casey Newton is

579
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,720
Speaker 2:  one of them. A bunch of our staff has done it. It just feels like people

580
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,720
Speaker 2:  don't want to participate in whatever he's doing.

581
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,600
Speaker 5:  I think it was kind of rough, especially earlier this week when, when he,

582
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,640
Speaker 5:  he made a bunch of transphobic jokes online and then he went and

583
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,680
Speaker 5:  appeared with Dave Chappelle in a very weird, bizarre appearance

584
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,120
Speaker 5:  in San Francisco. And like Chappelle is also kind of

585
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,480
Speaker 5:  notoriously transphobic. And I know a lot of people I know. Were like, I

586
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,440
Speaker 5:  think that's it for me. I think that's my, my moment.

587
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,280
Speaker 2:  So the moment that a lot of people mentioned to me was when Yoel Roth,

588
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,160
Speaker 2:  who was Twitter's former head of safe head of trust and safety yolan, just

589
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,960
Speaker 2:  like basically sick a mob on him. Yeah. So Yoel Roth had written

590
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,480
Speaker 2:  his PhD thesis about the responsibility

591
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:59,800
Speaker 2:  of sites like Grindr to provide safe experiences for young

592
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,760
Speaker 2:  people who were using the site anyway. Right? Right. So if you are

593
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,680
Speaker 2:  running a site, a grinder, you know that young gay people are on

594
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,600
Speaker 2:  your site. Right. You can't stop them. They there. So his PhD thesis

595
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,440
Speaker 2:  was you have a responsibility to create safer experiences for them.

596
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,400
Speaker 2:  And Elon tweeted an out of context paragraph of the PhD

597
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,240
Speaker 2:  thesis that says that that explains a lot. And he sicked a mob of, you know,

598
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,720
Speaker 2:  the the crazy groomer culture war people on his own former head of trust

599
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,120
Speaker 2:  and safety. Yeah. Who then had to flee his home. And that is just about as

600
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,920
Speaker 2:  bad faith shit box behavior as it gets. And that to me,

601
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,440
Speaker 2:  I think was, I don't need to make free shit for you a hundred percent.

602
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:41,200
Speaker 2:  Like I'm, I'm like too, it's my birthday tomorrow. Like I'm too old to work

603
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,560
Speaker 2:  for free.

604
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:46,880
Speaker 5:  Well we also saw, we saw the, the Elon jet stuff. Richard,

605
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,560
Speaker 5:  you, you've been following this is Elon jet back on

606
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,720
Speaker 5:  Twitter or do I only get it on Instagram now?

607
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:56,880
Speaker 6:  It is at this particular instant as I am talking and I, I can,

608
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,720
Speaker 6:  I can't say anything for beyond that. Still suspended again,

609
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,840
Speaker 6:  It was suspended and then it was back, and then it was suspended again and

610
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,400
Speaker 6:  they changed the rules and they said, no, actually you can release location

611
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,240
Speaker 6:  data maybe sometimes if it's a day after. And

612
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,720
Speaker 6:  there's been a whole saga of Elon claiming that someone was stalking him

613
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,520
Speaker 6:  and attacked a car that had his child in it, which many people can certainly

614
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,240
Speaker 6:  understand and relate to. But his reaction is, I think the problem is this

615
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,560
Speaker 6:  guy who is tweeting public informa publicly available information about where

616
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,160
Speaker 6:  my jet is, is the problem of someone attacking my car that I was not in.

617
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,800
Speaker 6:  So he has to stop. And he took that off of Twitter, which is also something

618
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,760
Speaker 6:  he promised he wouldn't do. But Elon's promises aren't worth anything. You

619
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,800
Speaker 6:  can just ask Twitter the company that he said he would buy and then didn't

620
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,320
Speaker 6:  want to.

621
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,360
Speaker 5:  So it's like TMZ and all of the like

622
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,560
Speaker 2:  Paparazzi? No, this is even, this is farther back. This is like 2000 5, 6 7

623
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,960
Speaker 2:  Gawker Stalker. Yeah. Do you remember this? I don't remember. Yeah. I mean

624
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,600
Speaker 2:  I was a former Geo media employee. You've gotta remember this. I mean,

625
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,120
Speaker 2:  I had this debate, I was there already, like Gawker's stalker, if you

626
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,640
Speaker 2:  don't remember, Gawker is a website.

627
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,920
Speaker 5:  R

628
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,760
Speaker 2:  I p. Many, many, many things have happened. Gawker was a

629
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,680
Speaker 2:  website for a minute. The height of its powers

630
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:14,880
Speaker 2:  Gawker had, I mean it was crowdsourced. It it was,

631
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You could just write in and be like, I saw Taylor

632
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,720
Speaker 5:  Swift walking out of,

633
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,920
Speaker 2:  And this feature was called Gawker Stalker and it had a map. And like literally,

634
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,600
Speaker 2:  I mean like the celebrities went crazy. They all hate, my gosh. The map went,

635
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,800
Speaker 2:  we're making it dangerous. This whole debate occurred already. I

636
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,520
Speaker 2:  I promise you in like 2007. Right. What you are at

637
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,360
Speaker 2:  now is Elon as a jet. It has a transponder. The

638
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,960
Speaker 2:  location of the transponder is publicly available. The flight plans of the

639
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,920
Speaker 2:  jet are publicly available.

640
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,840
Speaker 6:  Well they were, they aren't now.

641
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,600
Speaker 2:  Well no, they still are. They still are you, there's just this one Twitter

642
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,200
Speaker 2:  account. It's

643
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,920
Speaker 6:  Not available. No. He filed a thing with the FAA so that he doesn't have

644
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,640
Speaker 6:  to do that anymore because apparently that's the thing

645
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,840
Speaker 2:  He has, he has not succeeded in

646
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,400
Speaker 6:  Such way or is trying to anyway. Yeah,

647
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:02,080
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And they have to keep the, they have to keep those transponders on

648
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,920
Speaker 5:  because they're used by all of the different air traffic controllers and

649
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,760
Speaker 5:  all those air traffic controllers are paid for by the federal government.

650
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,880
Speaker 5:  Like basically has to do it because it's federal law. He doesn't just get

651
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,680
Speaker 5:  to be special. And he's upset about the fact that he can't just,

652
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,000
Speaker 2:  And the Supreme Court has ruled that the transponder data is not a publishing

653
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,800
Speaker 2:  is not a violation first. I mean it's like he's just like off in the

654
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,080
Speaker 2:  weeds of like, he hates this one Twitter account. I get it. I like, I get

655
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,480
Speaker 2:  it. And like having, he's

656
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,800
Speaker 6:  Now rewriting Twitter policy to say that you can't say where anyone is without

657
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,520
Speaker 6:  their consent. Which if you read it would say that the NORAD Santa

658
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,400
Speaker 6:  Tracker is done, first of all. Second, the people

659
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,120
Speaker 6:  who follow college coaches around to see who's getting hired or fired, their,

660
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,160
Speaker 6:  their accounts are done. Also, you can't live stream anything or post a picture

661
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,800
Speaker 6:  because if you post a picture and someone's in it, you'll know where they

662
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,200
Speaker 6:  are. You've now broken the rules and your account will be deleted.

663
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,600
Speaker 2:  Let me just say this. Lemme say directly welcome to hell Elon.

664
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,720
Speaker 2:  This is what it's like when you make speech regulations.

665
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,360
Speaker 2:  When you appoint yourself to speech police and you start with

666
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,560
Speaker 2:  all legal speech, you quickly discover there's a

667
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,800
Speaker 2:  bunch of shit that is legal that you don't like,

668
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,800
Speaker 2:  that no one likes. And most of this conversation

669
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,640
Speaker 2:  has been focused on whether or not we should let racist

670
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,160
Speaker 2:  people be like the size of people's

671
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,120
Speaker 2:  skulls determines how intelligent they are. Oh. Which is legal. That's just

672
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,480
Speaker 2:  a legal dumb ass thing you can say in this country that most

673
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,280
Speaker 2:  scaled social media platforms are like, well, the problem with doing that

674
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,680
Speaker 2:  all the time is it makes all the cool people go away and then we're left

675
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,520
Speaker 2:  with shitheads. So we don't want the shitheads to do that. So the cool people

676
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,320
Speaker 2:  hang out, this is more or less the calculus that is made on social

677
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,640
Speaker 2:  platforms every day. Do you want cool people? You can't have racists.

678
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,400
Speaker 2:  Do the cool people make us more money than the racist? They do goodbye racist.

679
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,280
Speaker 2:  We want cool people. It's not complicated, but that's where almost

680
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,880
Speaker 2:  all the energy of the conversation is. Right. But the reality of it

681
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:00,800
Speaker 2:  is that eventually your desire to be around who people always

682
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,600
Speaker 2:  wins. So you just like reduce the reach of the racism or

683
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,600
Speaker 2:  whatever you're gonna do. I

684
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,800
Speaker 5:  Mean, most people's desire, not Elon's,

685
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,760
Speaker 2:  But he wants to turn that knob down. I mean, he, he Right. Freedom of

686
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,400
Speaker 2:  speech, not freedom. He's got all the things. The, the problem is like

687
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,760
Speaker 2:  great, you can turn the knobs on that whatever. Your incentives are always

688
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,840
Speaker 2:  the same and they will always land in the same places. It's when you get

689
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,360
Speaker 2:  into things that are just flat out legal

690
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

691
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:29,440
Speaker 2:  Publicly available government data about where planes are that

692
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,280
Speaker 2:  you don't like, you have to start reaching. And I am very

693
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,280
Speaker 2:  sensitive to the notion that people should not know where I am all the time.

694
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,040
Speaker 2:  I think that's bad. I'm I get it, I'm with you. But the

695
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,720
Speaker 2:  proximate relationship to plain in city and

696
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,640
Speaker 2:  guy attacks car does not exist. Right. Right. It's,

697
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,440
Speaker 2:  it's actually not true. You can't, when he, he's he's, he's

698
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,000
Speaker 2:  swore he's gonna, or he tweeted that he is gonna sue this college kid that

699
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,400
Speaker 2:  runs the tracker because his car was attacked and you have to go to court.

700
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,360
Speaker 2:  I hope he files his lawsuit. If the college kid is like any other Gen

701
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,440
Speaker 2:  Z college kid, they've already got a merch store ready to go.

702
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:10,160
Speaker 2:  This lawsuit gets filed. They've already got a Patreon set up.

703
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,280
Speaker 2:  Like that's just hustle culture with the teens. But he's gonna show up in

704
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,920
Speaker 2:  court and he is gonna have to try to convince a judge or a jury

705
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,000
Speaker 2:  that there is approximate relationship. There's a cause and effect between

706
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,880
Speaker 2:  this Twitter account and this person doing the thing that they did.

707
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,680
Speaker 2:  And the Twitter account, just importantly, does not

708
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,760
Speaker 2:  actually tell you where Elon Musk is. It tells you where his plane is

709
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,080
Speaker 5:  And like it just says it's in this city at

710
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,640
Speaker 5:  this airport. Yeah. Which are, I think they're supposed to be

711
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,400
Speaker 5:  guarded and difficult to get into and do things around. That's my

712
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,240
Speaker 5:  understanding of how airports work in the United States. So like, he

713
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,480
Speaker 2:  Doesn't like it and he's the speech police on this platform. So he is now,

714
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,040
Speaker 2:  he's reached himself. He's seem

715
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,960
Speaker 6:  Like you keep saying these, these legal words,

716
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,120
Speaker 2:  But this is the thing that he's criticizing all of the previous administrations

717
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,880
Speaker 2:  of Twitter for. And I will remind everyone, once again, criticism of Elon

718
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,800
Speaker 2:  Musk administration of Twitter is in no way praise. Right. For the previous

719
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,600
Speaker 2:  dip, shit Twitter administrations, the, the, these things are not

720
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,680
Speaker 2:  opposites. They're, they've all been bad, but he's doing the thing that

721
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,520
Speaker 2:  every other platform ends up doing, in particular Twitter has ended

722
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,080
Speaker 2:  up doing, which is you have an outcome, you have some

723
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,760
Speaker 2:  pre-written set of rules, and then because you control the rules,

724
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,880
Speaker 2:  you can interpret them any way you want to arrive at the outcome you would

725
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,360
Speaker 2:  like. So he's like, this validates my rule

726
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,760
Speaker 2:  against public safety. And it turns out that he's, he both

727
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,480
Speaker 2:  writes the rules and is the judge. And at the end of the day,

728
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,440
Speaker 2:  that's the thing that delegitimizes you is no one believes that

729
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,360
Speaker 2:  the rules mean anything because the judge gets to make up whatever they want.

730
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,280
Speaker 2:  Right. And every platform has arrived at this exact moment and

731
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,240
Speaker 2:  had to make some kind of decision. Facebook notably set up

732
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,880
Speaker 2:  a Supreme Court, like a full on external

733
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,720
Speaker 2:  Supreme court to create the appearance of legitimacy for, its

734
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,400
Speaker 2:  the interpretation of its rules. And Twitter notably

735
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,520
Speaker 2:  did not do that. Right. They just do whatever they want, whenever they want.

736
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,640
Speaker 2:  Every platform just does whatever they want, whenever they want. And Elon

737
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,480
Speaker 2:  has just fallen directly into the trap because of the Elon jet thing.

738
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,010
Speaker 5:  I know we gotta cut to break in a second, but I have one question, one final

739
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,570
Speaker 5:  question. Does this make Elon Musk judge dread?

740
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,490
Speaker 6:  I just wanna know. Okay. So you, you act like he might lose in court

741
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,170
Speaker 6:  and maybe maybe the legal argument doesn't hold up or something like that.

742
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:35,120
Speaker 6:  But what if the person, person, he's going against hires a lawyer who happens

743
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,040
Speaker 6:  to be big into qan a again?

744
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:41,640
Speaker 2:  Mm, yeah. It's gonna get messy. It is true that the legal system

745
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,400
Speaker 2:  does not always produce the outcomes. You might think. I I go back to why

746
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,840
Speaker 2:  did it take a little bit longer to arrest St. Penman Fried? Because you had

747
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,160
Speaker 2:  to put together a case. Government's kind of lazy. It's all, I'm not out

748
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,600
Speaker 2:  here being like the government's great at this. Like they

749
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,800
Speaker 2:  routinely fail at getting the right outcome in court.

750
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,520
Speaker 2:  But I think this one is very much you show up and you just have

751
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,200
Speaker 2:  to prove that thing A led to cause B and in this

752
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,160
Speaker 2:  case, there's no connection between the two things. He just doesn't

753
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,920
Speaker 2:  like it. Yeah. And so he, he reached to a conclusion

754
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,760
Speaker 2:  and that's the thing that delegitimizes the regulator. Right?

755
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,480
Speaker 2:  And, and this is why people hate platforms. This is why ultimately it's why

756
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,440
Speaker 2:  people hate judged who makes the content moderation rules. He wishes he

757
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,600
Speaker 2:  was judged Strad. That is the answer to your question, by the way.

758
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,800
Speaker 6:  He's, he's the judge dread sequel that nobody watched with Joel Kenman in

759
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,240
Speaker 6:  it. That's rough. I love, I like Joel Kenman, but I didn't see it

760
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,520
Speaker 2:  By the way. On top of all this, the FTC is out there asking questions like,

761
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,440
Speaker 2:  do you have enough money to pay for the compliance that you are legally

762
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,680
Speaker 2:  required to do with us? It's, it's rough over there. All right, we gotta

763
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,960
Speaker 2:  take a break. We'll be back. Alice is gonna lead us through what's going

764
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,160
Speaker 2:  on in the streaming wars. We'll be right back.

784
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,770
Speaker 1:  Today's episode is sponsored by Airbnb. Airbnb lets you

785
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,210
Speaker 1:  book comfortable stays all around the world so comfortable, they might even

786
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:13,890
Speaker 1:  feel like home, which might lead you to wonder could my place be an Airbnb?

787
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:17,730
Speaker 1:  And if it was, what could it earn? The exciting answer to that

788
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:21,610
Speaker 1:  question is that right now you could be sitting on an Airbnb and not even

789
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,770
Speaker 1:  know it. Maybe you have a spare room that's already a haven for visiting

790
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:28,690
Speaker 1:  friends and family. So why not make it an Airbnb and make some extra

791
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,560
Speaker 1:  cash instead of letting it sit empty. Some people Airbnb their entire

792
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,160
Speaker 1:  homes when they're away for holidays or a big trip. That's a great way to

793
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,360
Speaker 1:  help cover the plane tickets. Whether you could use a little extra money

794
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,120
Speaker 1:  to stash away for a rainy day or you're saving up for something fun,

795
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:47,120
Speaker 1:  your home might be worth more than you think. Find out how much at

797
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,440
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Alex Kranz, this week you wrote the following

798
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,480
Speaker 2:  headline, the golden age of the Streaming Wars has ended. I would

799
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,440
Speaker 2:  tell you that I knew this was true. Yes. When h b host started pulling content

800
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,800
Speaker 2:  left and right, including its own

801
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,640
Speaker 2:  marquee hit show, F Boy Island, like

802
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,560
Speaker 2:  HBO Max had a hit show. Yeah, the show was a hit. People wrote about

803
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,400
Speaker 2:  it as like the best rethink of the dating show

804
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,960
Speaker 2:  in forever. Like people

805
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,280
Speaker 5:  Liked

806
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,760
Speaker 2:  F Boy, you should go read the coverage. I would tell you to watch it. You

807
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,000
Speaker 2:  can't cuz HBO O Max yanked it. Yeah, but don't read the coverage. And like

808
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,600
Speaker 2:  Vulture and other places, people

809
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:32,760
Speaker 5:  Love

810
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,440
Speaker 2:  To show also it's

811
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,520
Speaker 5:  Fun to watch. They upset you in particular. I know because Westworld

812
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:38,440
Speaker 5:  also got pulled I'm sorry,

813
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:41,600
Speaker 2:  I I I I was trying not to lead with Westworld.

814
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,040
Speaker 5:  I know. I can feel it in like, I could hear the, the the soundtrack in your

815
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,040
Speaker 5:  head for

816
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,600
Speaker 2:  The show. Yeah. I was like, what's the show with more than five people watching

817
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,440
Speaker 2:  it? And it's a flat Yeah. Westworld is yanked off the

818
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,160
Speaker 6:  Street still. They still have me as a viewer. I'm in. My subscription is

819
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,440
Speaker 6:  still good. It'll it will continue to be good as long as they keep the good

820
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,120
Speaker 6:  content on on HBO Max, which there,

821
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,880
Speaker 5:  Wow, I'm

822
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,240
Speaker 6:  Talking about Arlis, which is what I'm always talking about. Wait, what?

823
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,840
Speaker 6:  Arlis. That is the only show that they need to have

824
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,880
Speaker 5:  Is Arlis on. I thought it was on Showtime.

825
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,280
Speaker 2:  So you're just like deep in the archive. I don't think Zs Live knows Arlis

826
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,920
Speaker 2:  exists first of all. Like that's how you know your section. Sandra

827
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,280
Speaker 6:  Was on

828
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,800
Speaker 2:  The show like head of the class.

829
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:20,360
Speaker 5:  As long as he doesn't have to pay residuals on it, it's fine. But it, so,

830
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:24,040
Speaker 5:  so they pulled, they pulled this show, they pulled F Boy Island.

831
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:28,040
Speaker 5:  I'm so sorry Eli. They pulled Westworld. I'm so sorry

832
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,360
Speaker 5:  Richard. I know you guys both really loved those shows respectively,

833
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,400
Speaker 5:  but, but they yanked a whole bunch of this stuff. And part of this is, is

834
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,200
Speaker 5:  part of the same calculus. They've been pulling a lot of shows over the last

835
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,920
Speaker 5:  year. It's residuals, right? Like we've got a whole bunch of

836
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,920
Speaker 5:  contracts coming up next year, including ones for the Writer's Guild of America,

837
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:48,720
Speaker 5:  screen Guild, director's Guild, and they're all gonna be negotiating

838
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,560
Speaker 5:  for higher residuals because they want more of this. Like if

839
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,320
Speaker 5:  everything's on streaming, that's where the money is. And they would like

840
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,800
Speaker 5:  a cut of that. And you've seen, you've seen it already. A lot of these writers

841
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,960
Speaker 5:  and stuff are out there complaining right now about like how high their residual

842
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,800
Speaker 5:  checks were with traditional TV where they could support themselves after

843
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,720
Speaker 5:  writing a couple of really banger episodes because they'd go into syndication

844
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,240
Speaker 5:  and they just live on that money and then they can't do that

845
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:17,440
Speaker 5:  in the streaming world. It's just done like that. That kind of

846
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,480
Speaker 5:  way of, of making a living as a writer is gone.

847
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:25,680
Speaker 5:  So there's this residuals conversation, but there's also, it turns out a

848
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,200
Speaker 5:  lot of these shows are getting pulled because they're gonna pack 'em together

849
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,080
Speaker 5:  and sell seldom to what I learned is now called a Fast

850
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,640
Speaker 5:  Network.

851
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:37,160
Speaker 2:  It's good they've tried a few different acronyms for this. What

852
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:37,640
Speaker 2:  is the acronym?

853
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:41,480
Speaker 5:  This is, this is my new favorite though. Because used to, I was like the

854
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,760
Speaker 5:  cheap shitty networks, but now they're Fast Networks,

855
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:48,880
Speaker 5:  free ad supported TV is what that means. And

856
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,560
Speaker 5:  that means like the weird garbage version of plaques when you first

857
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,000
Speaker 5:  download Plex and you haven't put any of your other stuff on other stuff.

858
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,960
Speaker 5:  It's like, look, you wanna watch this movie with other stuff, stuff that

859
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,920
Speaker 5:  I've legally acquired. That's one, that's an example of it. I

860
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,960
Speaker 5:  think Tuby is an example. Pluto I think is an example.

861
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:10,360
Speaker 5:  Crackle when it existed. I think crackle's gone now. I

862
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,280
Speaker 5:  think it died finally. But but these, these still exist.

863
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,000
Speaker 5:  There's a lot of

864
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:15,920
Speaker 2:  'em, like the Roku channel.

865
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,720
Speaker 5:  Roku channel that's probably the most active, best known one.

866
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,320
Speaker 5:  And and so he's trying to pack it up and, and sell it there.

867
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,800
Speaker 5:  So someone probably Roku is gonna be like, do you wanna watch Westworld?

868
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,320
Speaker 5:  And a full season of that Jos Whedon show that got

869
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,080
Speaker 5:  canceled right when it got really good and it took way too long. Which was

870
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,840
Speaker 5:  that the Nevers

871
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,000
Speaker 6:  Raised by Wolves

872
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:41,840
Speaker 5:  Or No, that's a different one. Or that's a garbage show. That was

873
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,960
Speaker 5:  from, that's a bad show, Richard.

874
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:48,880
Speaker 5:  No, who did that? That was the guy who did the original, I can't

875
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,760
Speaker 6:  Remember who, who made what or which show they

876
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,040
Speaker 5:  Were on. Yeah, he made a TV there, there

877
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,640
Speaker 6:  Are too many shows, which is what your article mentions. Yeah,

878
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:55,520
Speaker 5:  That's

879
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:55,840
Speaker 2:  That's

880
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:59,440
Speaker 5:  He's too many shows. And so, so all of this stuff got pulled.

881
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:04,000
Speaker 5:  HBO O Max is is like, it's really kind of unclear what he's trying to

882
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,640
Speaker 5:  craft out of HBO O Max or Max, whatever you wanna call it.

883
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,000
Speaker 5:  Shout out to Better Max is in the world.

884
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,640
Speaker 2:  She's very cute. She's, I, I personally think they should just give

885
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,000
Speaker 2:  my daughter the streaming service.

886
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16,280
Speaker 5:  I think she'd program it better.

887
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:19,360
Speaker 2:  It would just be like bluey all day and all night and then whatever garbage

888
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,960
Speaker 2:  YouTube that she watches, which is honestly terrifying.

889
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,800
Speaker 5:  She'd be like, I don't care who has the rights to bluey, but it's coming

890
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,480
Speaker 5:  on my network. Make it happen.

891
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:32,480
Speaker 2:  It's basically how that would go. There's a, there's a Barbie

892
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,000
Speaker 2:  cover of girls just want to have fun that she loves. Hell yes. And then we'll

893
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,560
Speaker 2:  be in the car and actual girls just wanna have fun will come on. And Becky

894
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,960
Speaker 2:  and I will be like, do you wanna listen to the, the good version of this?

895
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,840
Speaker 2:  And she's like, this isn't Barbie. And then both of us are hearts break

896
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:50,600
Speaker 2:  in the car. We have to pull over and just cry wailing for hours

897
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,400
Speaker 2:  on end because we can't get our daughter to like Cindy Lauper.

898
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:57,760
Speaker 5:  Well she's like, play the good one in the back seat.

899
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,880
Speaker 2:  It's very, it's very bad. This is, to

900
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,240
Speaker 2:  Richard's point, Alex, this was your article, right? There was a golden ages

901
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,440
Speaker 2:  streaming when everyone is flooding the zone. Yeah. Honestly in search of

902
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,280
Speaker 2:  like monopoly style prophets. Right? Right. To be the one true

903
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,480
Speaker 2:  streaming network with the most subscribers. They were paying for a lot of

904
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,640
Speaker 2:  things. A lot of interesting stuff got made. And now all that stuff is kind

905
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,120
Speaker 2:  of getting canned. And I think what you're seeing with Warner in

906
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:26,160
Speaker 2:  particular is some changes that needed to happen

907
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,760
Speaker 2:  in that studio are happening. We should, yeah. Talk about the DC universe

908
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,320
Speaker 2:  or whatever's happening there. But the business model

909
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,520
Speaker 2:  is reverting to traditional television

910
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,400
Speaker 5:  And that's, I mean, it makes sense, right?

911
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,480
Speaker 2:  Right. Where you make some stuff, you run it once and you find a syndication

912
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,640
Speaker 2:  window and sell it again. Yeah.

913
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,480
Speaker 5:  And I think a lot of people want those syndication that like syndication

914
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,520
Speaker 5:  to return, right? Like syndication is dead. Used to the business of TV

915
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:53,440
Speaker 5:  was you go, you get to your fifth season, every season's 20

916
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,400
Speaker 5:  episodes. So you hit your hundredth episode. That means you're syndicated.

917
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,960
Speaker 5:  When you're syndicated. That means you get a really good deal with all these

918
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,680
Speaker 5:  smaller channels that syndicate you. And that means everybody who's working

919
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,600
Speaker 5:  on that show suddenly has like their house paid, like their

920
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,000
Speaker 5:  retirement is set when you hit a syndication deal. And that

921
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,800
Speaker 5:  disappears with streaming because nobody wants to pay syndication forever.

922
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,000
Speaker 5:  Right? Like zero people wanna do that. Nobody can afford that.

923
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,720
Speaker 5:  That's why we see stuff go on Netflix and then go away. And so

924
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:26,520
Speaker 5:  a lot of people, including probably Zaslav, wanna bring that back and they

925
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,920
Speaker 5:  wanna bring back the market. So in many ways Zaslav is

926
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,000
Speaker 5:  not the villain. He's actually good.

927
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Speaker 2:  Oh boy. This is a big change for you Alex. No, I like this is a big change

928
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,280
Speaker 2:  for you.

929
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:39,520
Speaker 5:  I hate him. I despise this guy cuz I think everything he's done has been

930
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,880
Speaker 5:  poorly messaged. I just think he's like a bad messenger. But

931
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,560
Speaker 2:  You're just big on messaging. You're like, I don't want an antitrust bill

932
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,360
Speaker 2:  in the omnibus. I was like, as I was doing the right things with messaging

933
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,160
Speaker 2:  it the wrong way, be

934
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,360
Speaker 5:  Gentle.

935
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,520
Speaker 2:  You're just looking for a gentle touch. That's

936
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,040
Speaker 5:  Fine. Yes. Like, yeah, 2020 was hard. Y'all like, like let's be more gentle

937
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,800
Speaker 5:  with how we announce things. But, but I think like his,

938
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,560
Speaker 5:  his calculus here is he wants to, he knows that network TV is

939
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,240
Speaker 5:  dying and that's where he made all of his money. And so he's like, how do

940
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,120
Speaker 5:  I reinvent network TV and bring it here? Meanwhile Disney is like, how do

941
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,000
Speaker 5:  I own all of the IP in the world?

942
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:12,920
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

943
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:13,560
Speaker 5:  Period.

944
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,480
Speaker 2:  And that's what, that's what Netflix has been doing as well. I mean, right.

945
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,000
Speaker 2:  That's again the point.

946
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,840
Speaker 5:  Netflix is like trying, I think Netflix is in a weird place because

947
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,640
Speaker 5:  they are so tech focused that they don't quite understand how that

948
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,360
Speaker 5:  TV industry worked before them. And they don't know necessarily want to.

949
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,480
Speaker 5:  And that's why we see things like they, they go and they, they sell ads,

950
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,200
Speaker 5:  but they're only selling ads to people who still pay

951
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,400
Speaker 5:  $8 a month.

952
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,400
Speaker 2:  Meanwhile, the fast trend, by the way we, I I mentioned the other acronyms.

953
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,160
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The one that died was a V O D ads supported video

954
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,360
Speaker 2:  on demand because it was stupid. And I

955
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,040
Speaker 5:  Bad

956
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,880
Speaker 2:  Message it was good because, because it was the opposite of svod, which was

957
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,680
Speaker 2:  subscription video on demand. And people would say these words to

958
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,480
Speaker 2:  us in dead seriousness, they'd be like the a v od market's

959
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,280
Speaker 2:  booming. And I'd be like, you need to reconsider yourself. And

960
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,880
Speaker 2:  they've now arrived at Fast. Yeah. Which is free and ad support tv fine.

961
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,480
Speaker 2:  It's fast. Very good. What you mean is D ads,

962
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,080
Speaker 6:  But it's keeping companies like Visio and Roki in business and the studios

963
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,160
Speaker 6:  and everyone else wants a chunk. They they're seeing that, they're seeing

964
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,840
Speaker 6:  these profits and they're, they want a piece of

965
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,720
Speaker 2:  It. Yeah. What's so, what's fascinating, you mentioned Netflix and they're

966
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,560
Speaker 2:  doing ads report this week. Netflix rolled out

967
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,240
Speaker 2:  its ad, they, they sold a bunch of stuff, right? They're doing the ads in

968
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,080
Speaker 2:  partnership with Microsoft. I don't want to overstate this

969
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,960
Speaker 2:  because even the people involved in the story, we're trying not to overstate

970
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,920
Speaker 2:  it, but Netflix is returning the money to the advertisers

971
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:42,520
Speaker 2:  because they can't deliver the inventory. Right? So

972
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:46,880
Speaker 2:  if you are a digital advertiser, this is our business too

973
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,920
Speaker 2:  by the way. Disclosure, I meant Netflix, ep, this show's called the Future

974
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,960
Speaker 2:  of You should go watch it.

975
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,400
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna mention Peacock Quick, do another one, do another one.

976
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,200
Speaker 2:  Comcast is an investor in a parent company, V Media,

977
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,000
Speaker 2:  whatever. Now you know this information, but net the way

978
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,720
Speaker 2:  like the ad business works is I don't like The Verge does like millions of

979
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,680
Speaker 2:  page views a week, right? Right. We have ad slots on the page

980
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,560
Speaker 2:  views. So we have inventory and we like tell advertisers like you

981
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,240
Speaker 2:  come by this inventory, we'll show you some impressions of ads. And there's

982
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,960
Speaker 2:  like a number, Netflix doesn't have the inventory. Like not enough people

983
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,720
Speaker 2:  have signed up for the ad plans and they're not watching

984
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,520
Speaker 2:  enough shows for Netflix to keep its promises about how

985
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,320
Speaker 2:  many ads will be shown to people. Yeah. So they're just returning the money

986
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,000
Speaker 2:  and all the advertisers are basically like, yep, they just started this thing,

987
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,840
Speaker 2:  they ran into it, it's q4, this is the hot time for

988
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,440
Speaker 2:  advertising, this is the holidays and all this other stuff. This is what

989
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,040
Speaker 2:  a good partner would do. So we can put the money against all their platforms

990
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,960
Speaker 2:  or people will actually see the ads. This is all fine. They'll get there

991
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,840
Speaker 2:  in the end. But that's where Netflix is at in growing that

992
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,560
Speaker 2:  side of its business. Which is they don't have the inventory. Like they,

993
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,200
Speaker 2:  they don't have a scaled advertising

994
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,600
Speaker 5:  Just started November 3rd I think was when it launched. So like

995
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:03,040
Speaker 5:  they haven't had a lot of time to build those subscriptions and they're gonna

996
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,960
Speaker 5:  have to build those subscriptions because most people were probably already

997
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,840
Speaker 5:  pay most people who were paying that $8 when it got bumped up to whatever,

998
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,680
Speaker 5:  is it 11, $12 are probably still on that plan or

999
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,560
Speaker 5:  just not on Netflix altogether. So like yeah,

1000
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,000
Speaker 5:  they're gonna take it, it's gonna take a long time I think for them to figure

1001
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,480
Speaker 5:  out how to do the ads well and H B O

1002
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,480
Speaker 5:  has that headstart in that Des lav knows that

1003
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,080
Speaker 5:  business. Super, super, super well

1004
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:30,680
Speaker 2:  You love

1005
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,480
Speaker 5:  Him. I do kind of love him. Like I respect him. I respect

1006
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,160
Speaker 5:  him. Do I hate everything he does?

1007
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:38,640
Speaker 5:  Yes.

1008
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:42,440
Speaker 2:  I don't want to like get too middle school on this, but like you love him.

1009
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:46,280
Speaker 5:  I love No, I know. I'm gonna like, I'm, what's that? What's that thing, the

1010
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,720
Speaker 5:  little paper thing you would do, put his name in there.

1011
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:49,840
Speaker 2:  The

1012
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,280
Speaker 5:  Triangles. Yeah. Where's Matt?

Speaker 5:  Mev Matt about,

1015
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:57,000
Speaker 2:  He might as well be pulling a hair. Alex, I just want to be clear about this.

1016
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:01,840
Speaker 5:  Call me buddy. Call me Zaslav. But,

1017
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,400
Speaker 5:  but he is like, he's, he's trying to, to bring TV

1018
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:09,400
Speaker 5:  back. And that's good in some cases because financially

1019
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,920
Speaker 5:  a lot of people are gonna make a lot more money theoretically in that way.

1020
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,680
Speaker 5:  Like you bring syndication back, you start selling this stuff to other things.

1021
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,440
Speaker 5:  You lean more on advertisers for your profits rather than subscriptions.

1022
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,040
Speaker 5:  You're gonna make more money. But that also means

1023
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:27,240
Speaker 5:  you're beholden to those, those like mass audiences, which

1024
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,000
Speaker 5:  means we're gonna lose a lot of really cool content.

1025
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The the comparison I think is most interesting here is music

1026
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,680
Speaker 2:  and Spotify. So Spotify, apple titled Amazon,

1027
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,440
Speaker 2:  whatever, they have the same basic relationship to the music industry more

1028
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,720
Speaker 2:  or less, right? The music industry makes a bunch of songs. They put 'em on

1029
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,640
Speaker 2:  these services, you pay the services, some money hit play, there's a calculation

1030
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,360
Speaker 2:  made and then the artist gets a penny at the end of the day. Yeah.

1031
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,280
Speaker 2:  Right? But they don't own the content. And every time you the listener

1032
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,160
Speaker 2:  consume the content, there is a series of financial transactions that take

1033
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,320
Speaker 2:  place in which the artist, the producers or songwriters, whoever

1034
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:06,760
Speaker 2:  receive some benefit. And I, I think it is fair and it, it is very

1035
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,320
Speaker 2:  clear, the industry has spent a lot of time arguing about that set of

1036
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,840
Speaker 2:  calculations between you hitting play and the pennies that show up in their

1037
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,360
Speaker 2:  bank accounts. And I, I think those conversations are fair and honestly that

1038
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,340
Speaker 2:  the number of pennies should go up. Yeah. When you hit play on Netflix, there

1039
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,980
Speaker 2:  isn't some payout, right? Right. Like you pay Netflix, the money you hit

1040
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:28,620
Speaker 2:  play, they own all the content. That's more or less the end of it. That's

1041
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,020
Speaker 2:  the case for Apple as well. It's the case for the the TV streamer. So the,

1042
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,820
Speaker 2:  the way that the music market works is like Spotify

1043
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,820
Speaker 2:  doesn't really own anything. That's why they care about podcasts so much

1044
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,980
Speaker 2:  cuz they get to own the

1045
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,740
Speaker 5:  Content. Yeah. Cause that's where they wanna own it.

1046
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:45,420
Speaker 2:  And so they're not, they're not taking a cut of everything. Right. They're

1047
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,220
Speaker 2:  not paying out some huge percentage of your subscription fee to someone

1048
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,180
Speaker 2:  else. They're making the podcast around the podcast. That's the end of it.

1049
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,820
Speaker 2:  They take all the money. That's where Netflix has been, right? They just

1050
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:59,500
Speaker 2:  like pay the money up front and they get 95 Shonda Rhim shows and like

1051
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,620
Speaker 2:  Shawnda Rhimes gets a huge check and that's the end of it where you're talking

1052
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:06,540
Speaker 2:  about syndication used to be used to make a show and then you would sell

1053
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,780
Speaker 2:  it 500 times.

1054
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,700
Speaker 5:  Like that's why Star Trek exists.

1055
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,500
Speaker 6:  The other thing is, you'd actually have some idea of how many people are

1056
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,540
Speaker 6:  watching it, which Netflix and the others, they're giving out a little bit

1057
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,580
Speaker 6:  more information now. But I

1058
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:19,900
Speaker 5:  Mean that's, that's part of the issue. That's part of the issue with Netflix

1059
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,260
Speaker 5:  we've seen

1060
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,700
Speaker 6:  Is that, you know, you, you, on the other end, you press play and no one

1061
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,260
Speaker 6:  knows, right?

1062
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,220
Speaker 5:  Like, like they, they've, they've started talking. They have to be a little

1063
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:29,820
Speaker 5:  more open now because they are selling, they're selling ads so they have

1064
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:33,100
Speaker 5:  to be more open. But you're still seeing this really weird thing where they're

1065
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,820
Speaker 5:  like, oh yeah, we're gonna give you a top 10 so you can see the show's most

1066
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:39,580
Speaker 5:  watched this month and we're gonna give you all these various kind of small

1067
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:43,100
Speaker 5:  analytics. And then a show will go like this one, I'm gonna talk about it

1068
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,980
Speaker 5:  cuz I really liked it and I'm sad it's get canceled. But it is part of this

1069
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:49,380
Speaker 5:  conversation. Warrior Nun gets canceled. It had been in like the top 10 for

1070
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:53,220
Speaker 5:  three weeks. It had, it had done really good numbers theoretically. And then

1071
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,820
Speaker 5:  it gets canceled and everybody, like its fans are like, we did all we could,

1072
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:59,980
Speaker 5:  you had people like watching it on four different networks in their house

1073
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,980
Speaker 5:  because they heard that that was one of the metrics needed to get a show

1074
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:07,220
Speaker 5:  renewed on Netflix. Like they're just like out there making little prayer

1075
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:09,380
Speaker 5:  circles and stuff, doing everything they can.

1076
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:10,780
Speaker 2:  Four TVs in a circle.

1077
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:14,700
Speaker 5:  Yeah. All in a circle staring at each other. And

1078
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:18,820
Speaker 5:  they still didn't get it renewed. And I think earlier this week one of the

1079
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:22,520
Speaker 5:  executives for Netflix was on, was it Hollywood Reporter Variety, just doing

1080
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,480
Speaker 5:  an interview and they're like, Hey, you canceled stuff but it seems to be

1081
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,120
Speaker 5:  doing well and you canceled it anyway. What's up with that? And they're like,

1082
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,000
Speaker 5:  well, you know, there's a lot that goes into it. We can't get into it right

1083
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,720
Speaker 5:  now and keeps on going and that's not gonna work. As,

1084
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:38,160
Speaker 5:  as this industry starts to kind of shift back into that TV space

1085
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:42,080
Speaker 5:  because you used to, you knew your show was gonna get canceled because it

1086
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,960
Speaker 5:  was doing terrible in the Nielsen ratings and like there was a whole

1087
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,640
Speaker 5:  lot of different signs from the organization that it was gonna do bad.

1088
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:53,520
Speaker 5:  And Netflix doesn't do any of that. Netflix just like spits it

1089
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,520
Speaker 5:  out and is like, enjoy. You didn't enjoy it enough. Goodbye.

1090
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:01,560
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I would just say like the old model was you would make friends.

1091
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:05,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And then they, you'd sell it to NBC is the first

1092
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,640
Speaker 2:  run and make your first big chunk of money and then you would sell

1093
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:13,560
Speaker 2:  it to whatever next U p n like U

1094
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,440
Speaker 2:  P N or the CW Ovation and like syndication and then like

1095
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,080
Speaker 2:  you just got to re-up those syndication deals over and over and over again.

1096
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,640
Speaker 2:  The example I'll give, which I, I always think about all the time,

1097
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,240
Speaker 2:  like I think a lot of people associate Shark Tank with cnbc.

1098
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:28,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1099
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,920
Speaker 2:  But CNBC buys Shark Tank in syndication from abc. Like first run Shark

1100
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,840
Speaker 2:  Tank is on abc, CBC just buys it and runs it in primetime at night. Like

1101
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,880
Speaker 2:  all day, every day.

1102
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:43,680
Speaker 2:  Disclosure on a CNBC contributor, this is disclosure. Every time we talk

1103
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,240
Speaker 2:  about TV it's like

1104
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:47,440
Speaker 5:  We, we just have a little ding pup every time you have to do a disclosure,

1105
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:47,920
Speaker 5:  it'll

1106
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,600
Speaker 2:  Be great. There's a lawyer, the Jeopardy's lawyers outside my window just

1107
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,200
Speaker 2:  waving at me. It's great. But that's a syndication deal and that's, it's

1108
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,120
Speaker 2:  a really valuable syndication deal not only for Shark Tank, right, but for

1109
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,200
Speaker 2:  cnbc, right. They're getting audience at night and they didn't have to pay

1110
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,360
Speaker 2:  to produce it. They don't have to pay to make sure it's hit, it's, they already

1111
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,200
Speaker 2:  know it's a hit. They're buying it for a discount cuz it already went out

1112
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:11,880
Speaker 2:  in the first run and they're getting audience at night. And that dynamic

1113
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,400
Speaker 2:  has not existed across any of the streaming services. So you're gonna, I

1114
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,000
Speaker 2:  think we're just seeing the industry move towards this moment where the content

1115
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,160
Speaker 2:  no longer belongs to streaming service forever. The people who make the content

1116
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,320
Speaker 2:  are saying we want second, third, fourth bites at the

1117
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,720
Speaker 2:  apple. Because making something for one upfront payment does not actually

1118
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,040
Speaker 2:  make you rich. Selling, making something once and selling it five times makes

1119
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:32,440
Speaker 2:  you rich.

1120
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,680
Speaker 5:  It's coming from the audience too, right? Like, like audiences

1121
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:39,360
Speaker 5:  are already complaining about, oh, you released everything at once and then

1122
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,880
Speaker 5:  I have to watch it and it doesn't have time to build audience. I don't have

1123
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,480
Speaker 5:  time to like get my friends into it because you're gonna cancel it in four

1124
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:49,320
Speaker 5:  weeks if I don't watch it four times at a circle. And, and so like,

1125
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:53,400
Speaker 5:  like I think everybody has kind of gotten fatigued with this glut

1126
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,240
Speaker 5:  of content we've gotten and as much as we've also enjoyed it, right? Like

1127
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,680
Speaker 5:  there's a lot of stories we wouldn't have gotten told in, in a world where

1128
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,480
Speaker 5:  people were thinking really hard about what to green light and

1129
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,960
Speaker 5:  what.so yeah. We're, we're just basically seeing a big

1130
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,840
Speaker 5:  contraction I think is about to start and it's gonna be really

1131
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It sounds like we're going back to basic cable. Like we're going back

1132
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:12,560
Speaker 2:  to basic

1133
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we're going back to basic cable, but you have less

1134
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:18,160
Speaker 2:  Power. Dude, Richard, that's where you and I came from, man. Richard and

1135
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:22,040
Speaker 2:  I started as baby cable bloggers and Gadget Richard used to run and

1136
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,040
Speaker 2:  Gadget hd. This is your tie. I

1137
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,920
Speaker 6:  Talked about more networks than anyone. I I I will never forget

1138
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,560
Speaker 6:  I said something uncharitable about one of the

1139
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:35,080
Speaker 6:  channels where they sell stuff and the only note they sent

1140
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,680
Speaker 6:  was that they had changed their name and I, and I didn't know. And they,

1141
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,760
Speaker 6:  they were just happy that anyone was talking about them.

1142
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:46,040
Speaker 2:  I can't wait for Richard and I to like go to another cable card meeting.

1143
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:46,640
Speaker 2:  It's coming.

1144
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,920
Speaker 5:  It's

1145
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,400
Speaker 2:  Coming. We're gonna have to do it. It's gonna be great. We should mention,

1146
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,560
Speaker 2:  by the way, we did an entire episode of streaming winners and losers, a Charles

1147
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:58,160
Speaker 2:  Plain Moore. We did the whole Go 90 scale. I have a giant note

1148
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,440
Speaker 2:  here from Lee that says, don't rehash that episode. So go listen to it. It

1149
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,120
Speaker 2:  was great. It was really fun. We did go 90 for everyone. I want to end this

1150
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:09,080
Speaker 2:  segment though by briefly trying to understand what

1151
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,520
Speaker 2:  is going on with the DC Universe with James Gun.

1152
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:14,640
Speaker 5:  He's making moves,

1153
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,760
Speaker 2:  He's making everybody mad, but he's doing apparently the right thing. What

1154
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,400
Speaker 2:  he, what's going on?

1155
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,360
Speaker 5:  I mean, he's kinda like EZ love in the way that he's not messaging correctly.

1156
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:24,840
Speaker 5:  I know. He, he's not doing it like my boy's as love.

1157
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:28,800
Speaker 5:  He's my future husband. Don't

1158
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,280
Speaker 2:  You know Zzz is the Angelo death man.

1159
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Z baby

1160
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:38,120
Speaker 2:  That you said that. I was like gently teasing you

1161
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:39,840
Speaker 2:  Zba

1162
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:42,560
Speaker 5:  Not me. Please, please don't include that.

1163
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:47,120
Speaker 2:  I didn't do that. I want be very clear that I had nothing

1164
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:47,680
Speaker 2:  to do with that.

1165
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,480
Speaker 5:  You, you could see it in your, I like I could see it in your head. I could

1166
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,640
Speaker 5:  see you coming there like

1167
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,320
Speaker 2:  You're Yeah, there's a word cloud right here that says

1168
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,880
Speaker 5:  Zba and I had to read it. I'm compelled to read things when I see it.

1169
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:02,440
Speaker 5:  It's what my co-star said today. It said that I needed to read things

1170
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:06,480
Speaker 5:  out loud. Yeah. But anyway, so a lot

1171
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,040
Speaker 5:  is happening there. Obviously he was put in charge

1172
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:13,720
Speaker 5:  of the Warner Brothers universe like DC Universe

1173
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:17,640
Speaker 5:  because they have as big an IP as Marvel. Nobody knew

1174
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,040
Speaker 5:  who Ironman was when, when that first movie came out in

1175
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,640
Speaker 5:  2008, like zero people knew who Ironman was. And now he's one of the biggest

1176
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,160
Speaker 5:  superheroes in the world. And DC has been looking at that for the last 20

1177
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,120
Speaker 5:  years, 15 years, whatever. Being furious cuz they have Superman

1178
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,880
Speaker 5:  and they can't figure out how to do anything with Superman. And so they,

1179
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,680
Speaker 5:  they bring in gun. He's like, yeah, I'm gonna change things up. And part

1180
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,320
Speaker 5:  of his thing is like the old shared universe sucks.

1181
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:46,960
Speaker 5:  And to his credit, the old shared universe sucks.

1182
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:53,520
Speaker 2:  It's not great. Even the ones that people like, like

1183
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,640
Speaker 2:  Aquaman, like if you read The Ringer, I love The Ringer. You should read

1184
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,640
Speaker 2:  The Ringer. It's great. The Ringer like, loves Aquaman and they love it.

1185
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,560
Speaker 2:  Ironically. Like they're like, this movie is so

1186
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,520
Speaker 2:  ridiculous that it's fun to watch and watch movie. Like

1187
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,240
Speaker 5:  When Nicole Kidman's movie shows up and she's like, I've been living underwater

1188
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:13,080
Speaker 5:  wearing fish bones for 20 years. And you're just supposed to be like, oh

1189
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:16,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I would say that the the Orchestral Fish Rock concert

1190
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:21,160
Speaker 2:  is really when I give up on they recut the Justice League movie in four by

1191
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,240
Speaker 2:  three and let people watch it that way. That was a thing. No, that's actually,

1192
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,800
Speaker 2:  I might have done this entire segment just to bring up four by three Justice

1193
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,360
Speaker 2:  League with your Richard. Look. Say what you will about Zla

1194
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:34,080
Speaker 2:  our new homie. Yeah. Z Baby. See

1195
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:34,280
Speaker 5:  Baby,

1196
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:38,640
Speaker 2:  He's making cuts. He's, he's knifing things. He brought in James Gun.

1197
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,440
Speaker 2:  James Gun. You know, he, he clipped Wonder Woman three Patty Jenkins put

1198
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:45,680
Speaker 2:  out a statement saying Wonder Woman three is off. She did not mention that

1199
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,280
Speaker 2:  Wonder Woman Two was a a disaster. That

1200
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:52,080
Speaker 5:  Wasn't a good Yeah, it was a horrible film. It was like just

1201
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,040
Speaker 5:  horrible. The worst movie. You're like, how do you have so many women making

1202
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:58,560
Speaker 5:  this movie and you're making this horrible, sexist movie.

1203
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:00,840
Speaker 5:  Like it was just obscenely bad.

1204
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:05,200
Speaker 2:  I feel like a movie. It's true. It was sexist in like surprising ways.

1205
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:05,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1206
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:09,960
Speaker 2:  The plot of the movie really centers around

1207
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:13,280
Speaker 2:  taking over someone's body and then having sex with them.

1208
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,240
Speaker 5:  Like not a good thing to do. And also Wonder Woman was

1209
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,040
Speaker 5:  a terrible friend,

1210
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:22,000
Speaker 2:  Very like, I, I just, I just wanna, that is what happens

1211
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:22,480
Speaker 2:  in that.

1212
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:26,240
Speaker 5:  That's the movie. She's like, how are you in this new body? And he's like,

1213
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:29,480
Speaker 5:  I don't know. And she's like, cool, let's bang. You're like, no,

1214
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:32,960
Speaker 5:  no woman. That's not super heroic at all.

1215
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,000
Speaker 5:  Stop. That's really quite

1216
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,640
Speaker 2:  Lot. Anyway, so he, he kills Wonder one Three, which seems like the right

1217
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:44,560
Speaker 2:  choice. Henry Caval is a long statement. He is like, I quit the

1218
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:44,960
Speaker 2:  Witcher.

1219
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,080
Speaker 2:  Whoops.

1220
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:51,440
Speaker 5:  He quit the Witcher. He gave us like, not even one of the

1221
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,280
Speaker 5:  good hymns worth brothers to replace him in Witcher. And then

1222
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,120
Speaker 5:  he's like, I'm coming for Superman. And like, actually we don't need

1223
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,720
Speaker 5:  you. Yeah. They said they're gonna go with a younger version of Superman.

1224
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:04,840
Speaker 5:  So theoretically Smallville

1225
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:09,160
Speaker 2:  All right, all this is happening. Whatever. It's all very funny in the background

1226
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:13,080
Speaker 2:  ending the Snyder verse, I just, the the Yep. Zla

1227
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,480
Speaker 2:  discovery changing all of Warner Brothers changing all this. I just want

1228
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,880
Speaker 2:  to rewind the time when the phone company

1229
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:24,160
Speaker 2:  bought Superman. It's a real thing that happened

1230
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:28,120
Speaker 2:  at and t buys Warner Brothers. There is an

1231
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,320
Speaker 2:  AstroTurf fan campaign from Zach Snyder and his

1232
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:36,360
Speaker 2:  fanboy army, which led to lawsuits Like

1233
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,920
Speaker 2:  crazy things have happened. Oh.

1234
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:40,520
Speaker 5:  And they're furious.

1235
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,400
Speaker 2:  They harassed the phone company so much potentially with

1236
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,120
Speaker 2:  bots that the phone company was like, we're giving you

1237
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,960
Speaker 2:  70 million to remake Justice League. And he was

1238
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,520
Speaker 2:  like, cool, it's gonna be in four three,

1239
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,680
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be in four three. It's not gonna be good. It's black and white

1240
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,600
Speaker 5:  if you wanna watch it that way. But

1241
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,160
Speaker 2:  Not a, that part I appreciated that was like, that's when you just like turn

1242
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,600
Speaker 2:  the screw all the way. Yeah. You're like, what if, what if it's so gritty?

1243
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,840
Speaker 2:  There's no colors in it at all.

1244
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,920
Speaker 2:  I will say they improve the effects. The story does make more sense. It was

1245
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,400
Speaker 2:  just the first time, I don't know, Richard, did you have this reaction the

1246
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:21,040
Speaker 2:  first time I sat down to watch it and you're like, oh, this shit's a square.

1247
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,360
Speaker 5:  The first time I thought

1248
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,480
Speaker 2:  My TV was broken, I was like,

1249
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,640
Speaker 5:  Neely, how many times have you watched it?

1250
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:29,920
Speaker 2:  I was, I was gonna watch it again because of all this DC universe stuff.

1251
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,560
Speaker 2:  I was like, I should just try one more time.

1252
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,640
Speaker 5:  Ready to get in. And

1253
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,440
Speaker 2:  Then I like this your time remembered that it's in four three and I was like,

1254
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,320
Speaker 2:  I can't be doing this. Yeah. And by the way, the point, I'm sure the

1255
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:42,880
Speaker 2:  Zach Snyder verse bots are gonna come at me. They're like, it's more like

1256
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,760
Speaker 2:  imax. That's the, that's the stated justification for being in four

1257
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:46,920
Speaker 2:  three.

1258
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:47,400
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1259
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,880
Speaker 2:  Is that you're supposed to, you're supposed to watch this movie in IMAX was

1260
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,600
Speaker 2:  very tall. And it's like, yeah, but

1261
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:57,240
Speaker 5:  You know what's not imax my phone that

1262
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,360
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna watch it on

1263
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:03,480
Speaker 2:  Just despite you. Anyway, just remember the time the phone

1264
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,720
Speaker 2:  company bought Superman and then got harassed by fanboy

1265
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:09,280
Speaker 2:  making a three hour square movie.

1266
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:15,080
Speaker 2:  We live through this together as a family. And I, I just wanna thank you

1267
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:15,400
Speaker 2:  all for that.

1268
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:19,200
Speaker 5:  I mean, I feel, I do feel bad for Cal though. Like he had to make the Square

1269
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,160
Speaker 5:  movie. He doesn't even get to make a movie when it's theoretically gonna

1270
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:22,800
Speaker 5:  be a good year

1271
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,560
Speaker 2:  With, with the like photoshopped mustache. That was

1272
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:27,640
Speaker 5:  So bad. Oh my god, that mustache was incredible.

1316
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:54,270
Speaker 5:  I was like, did you make this entire, it's just cars.

1317
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:55,670
Speaker 5:  This gadget section.

1318
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:56,710
Speaker 2:  I didn't make segment.

1319
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,270
Speaker 5:  I was like this is just ne Eli's

1320
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:02,110
Speaker 2:  Time. There's a lot of EV news this week and most of it is about the

1321
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:05,830
Speaker 2:  sounds that EVs might make. So there's a lot of EV news this week.

1322
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:10,110
Speaker 2:  Most of it is about like the sounds that EVs might make and then making

1323
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:13,670
Speaker 2:  it okay for car people to like EVs.

1324
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,190
Speaker 2:  So like Hyundai is gonna do like a fake manual

1325
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:22,150
Speaker 2:  transmission for its electric cars. Yeah. So

1326
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,790
Speaker 2:  you can feel good about it.

1327
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:27,590
Speaker 5:  Mila, do you remember the time I was talking about how people were gonna

1328
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:30,990
Speaker 5:  be so upset with electric cars because they wouldn't have transmission And

1329
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:32,150
Speaker 5:  you said people still ride horses.

1330
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:38,110
Speaker 2:  Well, Hyundai's doing one and Lexus is doing one. When I think of

1331
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:41,430
Speaker 2:  cars or the rip in manual transmissions, it's Hyundai and Lexus.

1332
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,030
Speaker 5:  That's, that's the only ones I think of.

1333
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:48,150
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So that's happening. They're adding sounds to them. You might

1334
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:52,030
Speaker 2:  recall from several episodes ago, Dodge is adding something called the Frazmic

1335
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:55,310
Speaker 2:  exhaust system to its charger ev.

1336
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:59,750
Speaker 2:  They won't disclose what it is, but you know what it is? It's speakers that

1337
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,190
Speaker 2:  make exhaust sounds in the back of the car. And then

1338
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:07,110
Speaker 2:  there's like the other side of it where it

1339
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:10,390
Speaker 2:  is true that cars should make sounds to keep people safe.

1340
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:14,270
Speaker 2:  EVs make a bunch of sounds. I have a new plug-in hybrid Grand Cherokee. You

1341
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:17,510
Speaker 2:  can run on ev mode. When you put it in reverse it makes this like whistling

1342
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:21,680
Speaker 2:  sleigh bell sound. It's very odd but it's still like a sound. It like

1343
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:25,520
Speaker 2:  makes sense. I want you to listen to the new

1344
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:29,000
Speaker 2:  Prius because it just, it's evil.

1345
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:32,280
Speaker 2:  It's an evil Prius. Liam, can we run the Prius sound please?

1346
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:39,240
Speaker 2:  That is the sound of being abducted by aliens.

1347
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:39,560
Speaker 5:  I

1348
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,000
Speaker 2:  Don't want that. That's what, that's what that is. That's when the, when

1349
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,480
Speaker 2:  the, the concentric circles lift you into the space.

1350
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,000
Speaker 6:  Why does it sound like that? Why did they

1351
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,280
Speaker 2:  Choose that?

1352
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:49,640
Speaker 5:  Can you imagine being high and walking home

1353
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:53,000
Speaker 5:  and hearing that coming down the street?

1354
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:57,160
Speaker 2:  It's a Prius backing up down the whole street. It's a very

1355
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,360
Speaker 2:  strange moment in cost. Panic

1356
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:58,640
Speaker 5:  Attack.

1357
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,720
Speaker 6:  What was the other choice? What, what, what lost out to that at the last

1358
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,480
Speaker 6:  minute? What, what was, what lived they developing that wasn't good enough

1359
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,720
Speaker 6:  and they said no, we have to go with

1360
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:09,160
Speaker 5:  This. Yeah, I assume it was like the price is right Sound they make when

1361
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:09,960
Speaker 5:  you get the answer wrong.

1362
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:14,680
Speaker 2:  I will say the Toyota's entire aesthetic for years now has

1363
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:18,360
Speaker 2:  been angry. Robots like ev like even like a Camry, like the ultimate

1364
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:22,000
Speaker 2:  family car is like what if this car transformed

1365
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:26,400
Speaker 2:  the Camry? And so like the sound makes sense the like

1366
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,320
Speaker 2:  in in context of Toyota's entire aesthetic, it's like

1367
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:34,160
Speaker 2:  yeah this should sound more like Megatron than not. I

1368
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:38,120
Speaker 2:  imagine that was the meeting. But we have an entire episode of the ver coming

1369
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,800
Speaker 2:  up from Andy Hawkins, our transportation editor and Andrew Marino about

1370
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,480
Speaker 2:  the sounds of cars because we are in the middle of just a

1371
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:49,400
Speaker 2:  revolution in what cars sound like because they can sound

1372
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,960
Speaker 2:  like anything now. Cause they don't sell like engines. I actually was with

1373
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,640
Speaker 2:  the Rivian folks a while ago when I test drove the R one s that is a

1374
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,440
Speaker 2:  dashboard, it's all screened obviously car makes no sound and they're like,

1375
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:02,320
Speaker 2:  we had to decide what the turn signals would sound like when you click the

1376
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:06,000
Speaker 2:  turn signal to go left or right. People expect a clicking sound that

1377
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,960
Speaker 2:  used to be the sound of a relay clicking on and off to turn the light on

1378
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,600
Speaker 2:  and off on the dashboard. Now it's just a screen. So we realized we could

1379
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,120
Speaker 2:  make it any sound we wanted and they're like, but if it gets too weird people

1380
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:20,320
Speaker 2:  won't know it's working. So we have got a whole episode about this stuff

1381
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:24,200
Speaker 2:  cuz it is wild to think that you could just start car

1382
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,960
Speaker 2:  sounds over or people megatron

1383
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:29,920
Speaker 5:  Hacking their cars to make their own sounds. Cuz I would absolutely have

1384
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,160
Speaker 5:  the we woo woo anytime I wanted to use my turn signal.

1385
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:35,320
Speaker 5:  Just the most obnoxious sounds.

1386
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,440
Speaker 2:  Tesla owners have been doing this for a long time. I will say that

1387
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:42,040
Speaker 2:  I don't try this and obviously, you know Tesla, everything from the horn

1388
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,880
Speaker 2:  people like have fart sounds in the horn, but now you're just seeing it get

1389
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,760
Speaker 2:  beyond the sort of hacker zone to the industry is competing on

1390
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,360
Speaker 2:  it. Right? It's an area of differentiation in in the industry

1391
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:57,120
Speaker 2:  and like cars are getting weirder and weirder because all the drive trains

1392
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,720
Speaker 2:  are becoming so similar. It it's neat.

1393
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:02,360
Speaker 5:  Are we gonna have an app store just for the sounds?

1394
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:07,320
Speaker 2:  Ring tones are back. It's yeah, everything comes back Ring tone. Yeah, car

1395
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:10,880
Speaker 2:  ring tones are basically back. So that's really cool. Our friend Tim Stevens,

1396
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,680
Speaker 2:  who Richard and I used to work with in Gadget as well, reviewed the Lucid

1397
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:18,560
Speaker 2:  Air Grand Touring for us. This is like one of the e vaporware

1398
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,400
Speaker 2:  cars. It's very expensive. He loved it. Go check out that review

1399
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:26,640
Speaker 2:  car looks cool. Lots of screens, lots of software in that

1400
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,760
Speaker 2:  car I will say. But he says the drivetrain is great. This is a big competitor

1401
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,080
Speaker 2:  at Tesla. We talked about Elon already. I'll just say this is the year

1402
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:37,240
Speaker 2:  that Tesla is gonna face its first real competition. I've complained

1403
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:40,800
Speaker 2:  a lot about vaporware cars in the show, but the Lucid is shoving in like

1404
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,440
Speaker 2:  some numbers. Porsche has a new Macon, a new battery powered Macon that looks

1405
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,960
Speaker 2:  very normals compete with a model Y. You can just see the

1406
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,480
Speaker 2:  competition's coming for Tesla in all kinds of other ways. I think that's

1407
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,400
Speaker 2:  gonna be fascinating. If the car ship please actually ship, that would be

1408
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,880
Speaker 2:  cool. Be into that.

1409
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,840
Speaker 5:  They ship that Cherokee yet?

1410
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,040
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I have one. You got it. I have it. We it, it took, I had to go get

1411
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,840
Speaker 2:  it blacked out, but we have it now. It is, it is

1412
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,720
Speaker 2:  the most Android computer that you have ever driven in your entire life.

1413
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:07,480
Speaker 5:  I don't want that.

1414
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:10,840
Speaker 2:  It's, it runs Android

1415
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:12,920
Speaker 5:  Like Oreo. It

1416
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,480
Speaker 2:  Does. No, it's, it's all very skinned. But every now and again it like, it

1417
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,800
Speaker 2:  just does something that's like, oh this is a slow Android computer. That's

1418
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,240
Speaker 2:  cool. It's nice call.

1419
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,880
Speaker 5:  Can you just point at it and shout Android when it does that?

1420
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,200
Speaker 2:  Like that's Android.

1421
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:25,480
Speaker 5:  I see it

1422
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:30,400
Speaker 2:  In particular the profile switching. Ooh. So if you push the memory

1423
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,120
Speaker 2:  seats, it's like me and then and that switches the, the

1424
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,320
Speaker 2:  presets and all the stuff on the tablet in the middle of the car and that's

1425
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,000
Speaker 2:  like, oh this is just Android profile switching and it's not going well.

1426
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:42,760
Speaker 2:  This, it doesn't like doing this.

1427
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,360
Speaker 5:  They did not spend money on a good processor.

1428
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,000
Speaker 2:  Gotta

1429
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Speaker 5:  Get a snap in there.

1430
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:50,920
Speaker 2:  They plug it in, we drive it around to the battery all the time. It's great.

1431
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,760
Speaker 2:  It's, it's doing its job. We should talk about Max real quick, we should

1432
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,120
Speaker 2:  talk about Apple. Oh, 16.2 came out this week Better always on display. I

1433
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,920
Speaker 2:  think every reviewer basically complained about the iPhone 14 always on

1434
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,800
Speaker 2:  display being too on. So now they've reverted to It was just on Andrew

1435
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,400
Speaker 2:  does. Yeah, it was just like on, it was like here's display. It was very

1436
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,680
Speaker 2:  confusing. So they've reverted you can go change it. They've added end to

1437
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:15,600
Speaker 2:  end encryption iCloud. They've added the new feature in Apple Music

1438
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,360
Speaker 2:  where you can turn the vocals down, which is pretty cool. Ooh. Bunch of cool

1439
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,760
Speaker 2:  stuff in there. But you know what, they haven't shipped yet

1440
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:21,800
Speaker 5:  That Pro

1441
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:25,640
Speaker 2:  Mac Pro with an M two chip or M one Max plus

1442
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:29,560
Speaker 2:  they haven't shipped really any other M two max. Right? They did the air

1443
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,480
Speaker 2:  in the 13 Inch Pro, but we haven't seen an M M two

1444
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,920
Speaker 2:  16 inch Pro maybe next week M two max studio. So I, it

1445
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,160
Speaker 2:  seems like yep, there's a lot of supply chain stuff going on. There are protests

1446
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,360
Speaker 2:  in China. It just seems like Apple's starting to take the hit of that stuff

1447
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:47,280
Speaker 2:  in a way that in the early part of the pandemic it seemed like wasn't

1448
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:47,840
Speaker 2:  even touching 'em.

1449
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:51,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Is it, do you think it's that or do you think it's the fact that

1450
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:55,880
Speaker 5:  they just like they, they were moving so quickly with

1451
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:59,800
Speaker 5:  these new processors that if they like released a new M two

1452
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:04,000
Speaker 5:  plus max or something, you know, eight months after the Max

1453
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,440
Speaker 5:  Studio, it would feel like cannibalizing their various offerings already

1454
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,080
Speaker 5:  out there. Well,

1455
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:12,040
Speaker 2:  No, cuz when they did the Max Studio, remember, and it was Johnny sru, he

1456
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,160
Speaker 2:  was like, and there's one more to talk about, but not at this time.

1457
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,720
Speaker 2:  And like you just rarely see Apple like wink and nod

1458
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:23,280
Speaker 2:  at the camera Yeah. About unreleased products. Right. But they were,

1459
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,240
Speaker 2:  they, they said it was coming. They, they said that these other, these other

1460
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:29,520
Speaker 2:  devices were Yeah, they like said out loud they were gonna do it and they

1461
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,480
Speaker 5:  They were gonna finish their transition Yeah. This year. So

1462
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,570
Speaker 5:  that's just like a

1463
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:39,330
Speaker 2:  Big ballpark. I think the, the things that are surprising to me are one,

1464
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:43,890
Speaker 2:  the M two is an upgrade over the M one, but it's not a huge upgrade.

1465
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:47,170
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And this is what we found in Monica's review of the M two air. It's

1466
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:50,450
Speaker 2:  an improvement to be sure, but it's not this like rocket improvement over

1467
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:54,370
Speaker 2:  the M one, the way the M one was over the Intel chips and then on the

1468
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:58,210
Speaker 2:  sort of GPU side, like Apple still isn't there. It's not like the

1469
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:02,130
Speaker 2:  GPU vendors have slowed down. So if you're gonna do a Pro Mac, like you've,

1470
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,450
Speaker 2:  you need high-end GPUs to, to make that case to people,

1471
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:08,920
Speaker 2:  to that customer base. And I, I think, I don't know, there's something there

1472
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,240
Speaker 2:  that doesn't seem like it's adding up yet.

1473
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,200
Speaker 6:  You can't do weird power per wat graphs against the, the 40 90

1474
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,840
Speaker 6:  when you're actually competing against the

1475
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,600
Speaker 2:  49. Yeah. You, you've got some real problems there. That's actually a

1476
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,800
Speaker 2:  holdup is they're trying to figure out what to label the graphs and they've,

1477
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,160
Speaker 2:  they've, they've been working on it for months. That's, I think that's interesting.

1478
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:29,800
Speaker 2:  And then there's a bunch of stuff in Iowa 16.2 that we're kind of waiting

1479
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,920
Speaker 2:  on, right. They, they said they were gonna do a classical music thing. There's

1480
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,480
Speaker 2:  like just a bunch of features that have not yet arrived.

1481
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,160
Speaker 2:  And I think Apples just starting to space out what it announces when instead

1482
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,960
Speaker 2:  of like these kind of monolithic releases, which they've been on track to

1483
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:47,800
Speaker 2:  do for years and years and years. But you just see, like, I think it's starting

1484
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:51,320
Speaker 2:  to catch up to them. I, you know, the early part of the pandemic, they was

1485
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:54,560
Speaker 2:  just hit after hit and they were shipping massive numbers of everything.

1486
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,160
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And now here this weird part where it like

1487
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:58,960
Speaker 5:  They're just tuckered

1488
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,480
Speaker 2:  Out. It's over. Is it over? It's like, you know, the, the protests in China

1489
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:06,040
Speaker 2:  are causing some major changes in that country. The covid lockdowns there

1490
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:09,160
Speaker 2:  are just like not gonna work anymore. Like, Apple's starting to feel that

1491
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,240
Speaker 2:  hit in a way that I don't think they've been totally open about. And I, I

1492
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,720
Speaker 2:  think we're just gonna see that continue for for months to come.

1493
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,720
Speaker 5:  Do you think we're gonna get the Mac Pro next year? Maybe.

1494
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:21,520
Speaker 2:  It, it feels like it's such a low volume product for them. Yeah. Like I think

1495
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,560
Speaker 2:  they think the Mac Studio is doing that job as much as it needs to do that

1496
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,320
Speaker 2:  job for that market. Right. If you're a professional

1497
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,160
Speaker 2:  premier user or whatever developer, somebody

1498
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,920
Speaker 2:  who's like really needs that power, you have already bought a Mac studio.

1499
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:39,040
Speaker 2:  Right. Or you're on Windows and you're fine. And like Apple can

1500
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,520
Speaker 2:  come get you next time. So I don't know if they feel what's

1501
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,320
Speaker 5:  Like the differentiator? Is it just like you'll be able to put an a MD GPU

1502
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,720
Speaker 5:  in it if you really want to?

1503
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:50,800
Speaker 2:  I think differentiator's gonna be their gpu. Ooh. Making I think it might

1504
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,200
Speaker 2:  be the, the holdup. I think they've gotta beat what, what the other folks

1505
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,520
Speaker 2:  are doing. Okay. I think it would be really weird to Apple the DAM series

1506
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:01,480
Speaker 2:  chips and named D G P. Like, it just

1507
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:02,800
Speaker 2:  doesn't seem like the way they're gonna go.

1508
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:06,600
Speaker 5:  I mean the big reason that they took so long with the last pro release was

1509
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,560
Speaker 5:  they were like, we wanna make it as modular as possible. We wanna make it

1510
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:13,280
Speaker 5:  more like a pc, but we don't like PCs, don't talk about PCs here.

1511
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:17,000
Speaker 5:  And so with their current setup, they really can't do that, that modular

1512
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,880
Speaker 5:  thing, right? Like a modular Mac Pro where you

1513
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,200
Speaker 5:  can replace the M two with the M three when it comes out and replace the

1514
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:28,040
Speaker 5:  gpu. That's a Yeah. They're never Yeah, they're not gonna do that. So it's

1515
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:31,960
Speaker 5:  like, what, what does a macro pro look like in a world where

1516
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,960
Speaker 5:  they, they sacrifice that modularity again?

1517
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:37,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah. No, no. I I I think they thought they had an answer. Right? I think

1518
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:41,600
Speaker 2:  that's why they hinted at it. So like explicitly. Yeah. I think

1519
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,240
Speaker 2:  that, I think that answer has changed. And I, we'll say, I, I just think

1520
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,880
Speaker 2:  it's interesting that like this was supposed to be in transition and like

1521
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,480
Speaker 2:  hasn't been here and it's very rare that Apple

1522
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,760
Speaker 2:  misses deadline. This I think the stakes are low. Yeah. I think the stakes

1523
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:58,040
Speaker 2:  are much higher for can you ship enough iPhones, which they're struggling

1524
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:58,240
Speaker 2:  with

1525
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:01,600
Speaker 6:  Are are they recalibrating what power means? Like for a machine like that

1526
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,160
Speaker 6:  now now you, you're talking about selling it to someone maybe who's doing

1527
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:07,960
Speaker 6:  AI processing or, or tasks that weren't on those old Mac

1528
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:11,680
Speaker 6:  pros and now maybe they, they are saying, you know what we were doing, we,

1529
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:15,160
Speaker 6:  we were aiming at a market that doesn't exist anymore and now somebody who

1530
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,600
Speaker 6:  might buy this is doing something completely different and we need to rethink

1531
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:17,720
Speaker 6:  it.

1532
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:20,920
Speaker 5:  We were gonna sell it to the crypto market, now we gotta sell it to the AI

1533
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:21,920
Speaker 5:  market. Oh

1534
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,320
Speaker 2:  My God. There's no way that crypto miners were gonna be buying in

1535
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:26,720
Speaker 2:  Max, like just

1536
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:27,920
Speaker 5:  Spending $30,000

1537
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,400
Speaker 2:  On a Yeah. The the whole name of that game was like buying

1538
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:34,360
Speaker 2:  was reducing your cost to run a gpu.

1539
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,280
Speaker 6:  Only they could have done crypto mining on old PS three s. That would've

1540
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,400
Speaker 6:  been the perfect story just for the content. It

1541
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,360
Speaker 5:  Would've been great. All

1542
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:44,400
Speaker 2:  Right. Well Richard, you, you even assigned that story. Can you mine a, a

1543
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,960
Speaker 2:  single Bitcoin on a PS three

1544
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,400
Speaker 5:  A fraction? We'll give you just a fraction.

1545
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,000
Speaker 2:  We'll see you in 10 years.

1546
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:50,760
Speaker 5:  We will not be paying your power bill.

1547
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,640
Speaker 2:  You can run Linux. I think my PS three is one of the PS three. You can run

1548
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,480
Speaker 2:  Linux on. All right, I'm gonna dig out my old PS three and see if I can get

1549
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,040
Speaker 2:  Linux on it. To, to render a Bitcoin, render a Bitcoin, by the way, an old,

1550
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,600
Speaker 2:  an old joke from the show. Shut up Paul Miller.

1551
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:07,360
Speaker 2:  Okay, two things we should talk about to wrap up. One Instagram rollout notes,

1552
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,480
Speaker 2:  which is, seems like it's like weirdo Twitter competitor. It's great, but

1553
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:14,320
Speaker 2:  it's actually just a way messages and is the funniest thing in

1554
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,000
Speaker 6:  The entire world. Nothing goes away forever.

1555
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:19,680
Speaker 5:  I'm fully on board with using it as my communication app now.

1556
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:22,000
Speaker 5:  Like goodbye Twitter dm it. It's

1557
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,880
Speaker 6:  The only thing that's made me open Instagram again in like six months. Same.

1558
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:25,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They, they

1559
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,640
Speaker 2:  Did it. All the olds are goofing. We are told reliably that the Youngs are

1560
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,080
Speaker 2:  selling weed. That's very

1561
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,720
Speaker 5:  Cool. I'm just doing sound garden lyrics.

1562
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:37,960
Speaker 2:  But you see there is a wave of innovation in social networks again, because

1563
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,920
Speaker 2:  of the, the Twitter drum that is actually pretty exciting. And like Instagram

1564
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,160
Speaker 2:  rolling out this feature in the old days, right, Instagram would only do

1565
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,560
Speaker 2:  things that they thought like a billion more people would sign up for Instagram

1566
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,560
Speaker 2:  to do something. No one's signing up for Instagram to use notes.

1567
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:55,680
Speaker 2:  But like, can they capture some minutes of your day back from Twitter?

1568
01:24:55,810 --> 01:24:59,240
Speaker 2:  As Twitter goes through a spasm, they can so they they can justify the stuff.

1569
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:02,400
Speaker 2:  It's actually pretty fun. So Instagram's doing that. And then I want to end,

1570
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,520
Speaker 2:  of course we're talking about Matter. Google,

1571
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:10,160
Speaker 2:  it happened Iowa 16.2 brought matter support. So

1572
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:14,080
Speaker 2:  Matter is here. The First Eve devices run on thread.

1573
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,920
Speaker 2:  Now support matter. Google has announced that Nest hubs

1574
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,720
Speaker 2:  and some Android devices support matter. You know, it doesn't though Nest

1575
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,640
Speaker 2:  thermostats. It's like the one thing everybody wants. How

1576
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,360
Speaker 5:  You doing at Deli?

1577
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:30,200
Speaker 2:  I have a HomeBridge set up. Okay. I switch from Hoos to HomeBridge.

1578
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:34,320
Speaker 2:  I'll, I'm gonna dox my good friend Joanna Stern, she just installed the hoops

1579
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,120
Speaker 2:  and texted me about it. Home Hoos is HomeBridge out of box. It's like a,

1580
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:40,320
Speaker 2:  yeah, whatever. It doesn't matter. They're little tamagotchis that you put

1581
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:44,280
Speaker 2:  in your garage to make all the rival systems talk to each

1582
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:48,200
Speaker 2:  other in particular to get a home kit in about three times a year. They fail

1583
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,600
Speaker 2:  catastrophically and you have to start over. But it's fine because you have

1584
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,160
Speaker 2:  a little tamagotchi that you have to care for a little Linux

1585
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:58,240
Speaker 2:  tamagotchi that you care for and for a while it all works. And if you're

1586
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,480
Speaker 2:  a nerd, it's, it's like deeply rewarding to make a raspberry pie. Force your

1587
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,000
Speaker 2:  nest thermostat to shov up an oak kit. It's

1588
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,120
Speaker 5:  Nice. I use it for my Dyson fan.

1589
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:08,520
Speaker 2:  I'm confident that when Joanne fails I'm gonna be in trouble in some like

1590
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,440
Speaker 2:  meaningful way. But for now she's

1591
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:13,880
Speaker 5:  Very happy. Like just block her number for a week after. She's like, I know

1592
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,560
Speaker 5:  you can't turn on any of your lights in your home. It's

1593
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,360
Speaker 2:  Fine. Yeah. She's like, I just opened my garage with Siri. I've never been

1594
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,560
Speaker 2:  happier. And I was like, I'm so like, welcome to my club. It's a good club.

1595
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,120
Speaker 2:  This is what it's like to have ta nagashi together but matters here. This

1596
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:30,040
Speaker 2:  is like the thing, it's happening. You are, as you listen to this

1597
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:33,840
Speaker 2:  in your car witness to the birth of a new smart home connectivity standard.

1598
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:37,320
Speaker 2:  It's way better than whatever horny stuff Alex is doing. See

1599
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,160
Speaker 5:  Daddy, I'm still just thinking about him.

1600
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,560
Speaker 2:  Jen Tuey is covering the hell outta matter. It's great. It's all over the

1601
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,800
Speaker 2:  website. Go check it out. But yes, if you have Google stuff, nest stuff,

1602
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:51,040
Speaker 2:  that stuff isn't silently upgraded to support matter. The first devices are

1603
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,640
Speaker 2:  out. If you have an iPhone, you now support matter. This is all real. And

1604
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:58,120
Speaker 2:  I think it's gonna be cool if these companies can just be cool,

1605
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,000
Speaker 2:  which is a tall order. But I think it's, I think it's gonna happen. I think

1606
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,880
Speaker 2:  they, I think the executives

1607
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,320
Speaker 5:  At these you like going to ces. Just be

1608
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:09,400
Speaker 2:  Cool guys. I mean if I was gonna Cs I would honestly walk around and be like,

1609
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:13,400
Speaker 2:  be cool. Like, yes, I would do exactly what you're saying. Thankfully

1610
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,760
Speaker 2:  after going Cs for like 15 years in a row, I've not, I'm not being made to

1611
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:20,480
Speaker 2:  go this year. But I think we're gonna see a flood of matter

1612
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,560
Speaker 2:  devices at CS a hundred percent fly of smart home gadgets that actually support

1613
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:27,520
Speaker 2:  matter that are actually gonna ship. And I, I, I think that

1614
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,360
Speaker 2:  enough of the executives of these companies that we have talked to have houses

1615
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:35,720
Speaker 2:  full of things that don't talk to each other and are aware

1616
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:39,680
Speaker 2:  that all their customers are kind of mad at them. So I, there's just

1617
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:43,600
Speaker 2:  a part of me that says the incentive to just like be happy is higher

1618
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:47,080
Speaker 2:  than the business incentive to make money for these people

1619
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:50,880
Speaker 2:  specifically because they want to open their garage doors with

1620
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,840
Speaker 2:  Siri without having a Linux Tamagotchi. We'll see. Be

1621
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:55,040
Speaker 2:  cool.

1622
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:55,720
Speaker 5:  Be

1623
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,600
Speaker 2:  Cool. All right. Anything else we should talk about? Let's just send it,

1624
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:02,960
Speaker 2:  let's call it a day. Alright, we are way over as always.

1625
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,600
Speaker 2:  There's more to talk about. We have Google basically had an all hands this

1626
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:09,800
Speaker 2:  week where they, they said they're not gonna chat GBT yet because of reputational

1627
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:13,720
Speaker 2:  risk. That's a lot because it's always wrong. Yeah, there's

1628
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,000
Speaker 2:  all kinds of stuff inside. It was a really fun week on the site. There's
