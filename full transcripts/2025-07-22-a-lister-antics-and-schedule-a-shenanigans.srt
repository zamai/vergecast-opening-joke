Description: Summer blockbusters like the new Superman and Jurassic World movies may be doing great at the box office, but promoting them is more complicated than ever. The old celebrity playbook of magazine profiles, TV chat shows and press junkets isn’t enough in an era of audience fragmentation. Publicists now have to strategize which podcasts to make time for, and whether their clients will eat chicken on YouTube with Amelia Dimoldenberg or Sean Evans.

This week on The Vergecast, guest host Mia Sato talks to Vulture’s Fran Hoepfner to break down the ever-changing new media circuit, whether you’re a beloved A-lister, a formerly-beloved A-lister, or an aspiring A-lister.

Then, we take a deep dive with Sarah Fackrell into a controversial legal tactic brands are using to go after online sellers hawking everything from grumpy cat T-shirts to closet hooks.

Finally, Victoria Song joins Mia to answer a Vergecast hotline from a listener wondering whether an AI translator will be able to keep up with his partner’s Colombian mother. If you’ve got a question for us, call 866-VERGE11 or e-mail vergecast@theverge.com.

00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:07,195
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of talking about other people

3
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:10,795
Speaker 2:  eating chicken on other podcasts, but we don't eat chicken on this podcast.

4
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:15,395
Speaker 2:  I'm Mia Sato and I'm going to be taking over the Tuesday show while David

5
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:18,555
Speaker 2:  is on parental leave for a few weeks. On today's show, we're talking about

6
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:22,075
Speaker 2:  summer blockbuster seasons. There's movie after movie coming out and

7
00:00:22,075 --> 00:00:25,715
Speaker 2:  celebrities want to get their project in front of you, or

8
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:29,715
Speaker 2:  maybe they just wanna put themselves in front of you. We're gonna be talking

9
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:33,515
Speaker 2:  to Fran Hoffner, a news writer at Vulture, and a friend of mine

10
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:37,315
Speaker 2:  who wrote a really excellent piece back in June about the crazy

11
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:40,915
Speaker 2:  hoops that celebrities now have to jump through in order to get attention

12
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:44,915
Speaker 2:  in an age of fragmented media consumption and at a time when

13
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:48,595
Speaker 2:  linear television is on the decline. After that, we're going to talk

14
00:00:48,595 --> 00:00:52,435
Speaker 2:  about the flood of cheap knockoff and copycat products that you have

15
00:00:52,435 --> 00:00:55,755
Speaker 2:  no doubt seen online before. In an age of cheap

16
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:59,955
Speaker 2:  copycat products, brands have found a way to go after dozens or even

17
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:03,915
Speaker 2:  hundreds of storefronts that they say are infringing on their IP rights.

18
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:07,675
Speaker 2:  But what happens when someone is wrongly accused of IP infringement?

19
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:11,795
Speaker 2:  There's a new crop of lawsuits called Schedule A, that's something of a legal

20
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:15,795
Speaker 2:  trend. Right now we're talking with law professor Sarah Fackrell about

21
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:19,915
Speaker 2:  what these lawsuits do and how they could hurt competition online. Later

22
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:23,035
Speaker 2:  on, we'll have my colleague v song on to help me answer a question about

23
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:27,115
Speaker 2:  AI translators. But first I have to go unbox 20 Labu

24
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:29,755
Speaker 2:  Boo Blind boxes. This is The Verge cast. We'll be right back.

25
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:23,745
Speaker 2:  Welcome back to The Vergecast. My first guest today is Fran Hoffner.

26
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:27,465
Speaker 2:  She's a news writer at Vulture and she did a great piece back in June

27
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:31,705
Speaker 2:  about all the weird ways celebrities try to get our attention in an

28
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:35,385
Speaker 2:  age when audiences are fragmented into a million pieces Since its summer

29
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:38,145
Speaker 2:  blockbuster season, I thought it would be a great time to talk about how

30
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:41,865
Speaker 2:  celebrities are navigating this new media circuit and all the

31
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:45,585
Speaker 2:  highs and lows and weird moments that this has created.

32
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:49,785
Speaker 2:  Fran, maybe just like describe what is the new media circuit? Who are the

33
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:53,025
Speaker 2:  main players? Where does this content live? Where does it look like out in

34
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,985
Speaker 2:  the world? The new media circuit lives

35
00:03:56,685 --> 00:04:00,345
Speaker 2:  98% on the screen of a phone. It is vertical

36
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:04,425
Speaker 2:  video interviews and video podcasts

37
00:04:04,455 --> 00:04:07,425
Speaker 2:  such as this, such as this, such as The Vergecast we're, we're on the new

38
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:09,625
Speaker 2:  media circuit right now. I have to eat chicken after this.

39
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:14,865
Speaker 2:  And it's talking with a lot of the time

40
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,025
Speaker 2:  a kind of internet celebrity that

41
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:23,145
Speaker 2:  exists somewhere between civilian and fellow

42
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:27,225
Speaker 2:  celebrity that actors and musicians and

43
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,905
Speaker 2:  people on press tours now talk to. So we have the Chicken shows Chicken

44
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:32,385
Speaker 2:  Shop Day. Can I

45
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:36,345
Speaker 6:  Ask you a question? Oh yes. What's it like doing this all the

46
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:39,425
Speaker 6:  time? What do you mean all the time? I do other things? Do you ever eat anything

47
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:40,385
Speaker 6:  other than this? No

48
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:41,585
Speaker 2:  Hot ones.

49
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:45,665
Speaker 7:  Hey, what's going on everybody for First Week Feast, I'm Sean Evans and you're

50
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,465
Speaker 7:  watching Hot Ones. It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.

51
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:50,105
Speaker 7:  And today we're joined by Owen Wilson.

52
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:54,265
Speaker 2:  There are more reels and TikTok centric shows like

53
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:55,385
Speaker 2:  Subway takes.

54
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:56,505
Speaker 8:  So what's your take?

55
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,505
Speaker 9:  Fundamentally, everyone is a good person. A hundred

56
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:03,425
Speaker 8:  Percent disagree. I can think of countless examples of bad people. I'm

57
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:04,345
Speaker 8:  not even gonna rattle off.

58
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,985
Speaker 9:  People are not bad. They're infected.

59
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:11,885
Speaker 2:  And part of the new media circuit is to

60
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:15,765
Speaker 2:  show that the person promoting the project is a person. We're

61
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:19,245
Speaker 2:  so normal. Completely. I'm completely normal. It's actually totally,

62
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,725
Speaker 2:  it's frequently at least project agnostic. Mm. They

63
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:27,525
Speaker 2:  almost don't even ever talk about the project at hand, but instead just

64
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:30,565
Speaker 2:  talk to whatever host about whatever

65
00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:34,445
Speaker 2:  inanities that Yeah, they wanna talk about. Sit down and open up

66
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:38,765
Speaker 2:  vibes sometimes or sit down and be silly. Yeah. Anything to more

67
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:42,685
Speaker 2:  further the name of the person on the show than the project, because

68
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:46,125
Speaker 2:  maybe movies aren't selling as well, maybe people aren't watching TV how

69
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,925
Speaker 2:  they used to, but if that person can stay in the zeitgeist, maybe

70
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:53,725
Speaker 2:  there's still another movie to do or another TV show. And it's

71
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:57,165
Speaker 2:  all about trying to establish or reestablish

72
00:05:57,595 --> 00:06:01,365
Speaker 2:  sort of like who are our A-listers, who are, who are people

73
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:05,365
Speaker 2:  who are getting people to engage with things. And this circuit is both

74
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,165
Speaker 2:  trying to cement that, but also kind of spreading

75
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:12,925
Speaker 2:  everyone out in a way where almost no one is able to stand out in the past.

76
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:16,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's, so it's interesting because like the level of celebrity feels

77
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:20,165
Speaker 2:  like it has really been through the ringer, or like the levels of

78
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:23,845
Speaker 2:  celebrity, what makes someone an Alister versus just like very, very

79
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:27,685
Speaker 2:  saturated or famous or known. So we'll talk about that

80
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:31,725
Speaker 2:  a little bit later, but how does a new media circuit interact with like the,

81
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:34,805
Speaker 2:  what we would think of as the traditional media circuit? You go on daytime

82
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:38,485
Speaker 2:  television, you do a late night show, maybe you do like a glossy magazine

83
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:41,925
Speaker 2:  cover or a spread. Like how do these things kind of

84
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:44,805
Speaker 2:  collide? Do celebrities do both? Do they do

85
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:49,805
Speaker 2:  mostly the traditional thing with a sprinkle of, you know, a TikTok takes

86
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:53,925
Speaker 2:  show? Like what? What is the structure? I think they're doing about half

87
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:57,205
Speaker 2:  and half, but it's been interesting to watch

88
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:01,525
Speaker 2:  the more traditional forms like late night and daytime tv

89
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:06,005
Speaker 2:  and even legacy magazines now also have to adhere to the

90
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:09,725
Speaker 2:  new media circuit. Like you want the late night clips to make it onto

91
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:13,485
Speaker 2:  TikTok or Instagram reels, Vogue Wired,

92
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:17,765
Speaker 2:  vanity Fair all have their own video series that are also on TikTok

93
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:21,685
Speaker 2:  And Instagram such as The Vergecast. Exactly. Yeah. This clip will be going

94
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:25,005
Speaker 2:  around on TikTok, thank God. And going viral I'm sure. And going viral.

95
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:28,965
Speaker 2:  We're offending the traditional media circuit actually that's right. By doing

96
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:32,685
Speaker 2:  this podcast. So true. I think about, what is it, the Spirit

97
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:36,605
Speaker 2:  tunnel on the Jennifer Hudson show. Oh my, yes. That's like

98
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:40,685
Speaker 2:  built for scrolling. Yes. So stars

99
00:07:40,785 --> 00:07:44,565
Speaker 2:  are still having to do these circuits, but now those traditional circuits

100
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:48,525
Speaker 2:  have to adhere to what goes on the phone. Yeah. I think

101
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:52,405
Speaker 2:  almost the only unchanging medium to some degree is SNL Mm.

102
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:55,685
Speaker 2:  Which used to be the main place people would go to make fun of themselves.

103
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:59,565
Speaker 2:  And now it feels like everything is designed to prove the person in question

104
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:03,005
Speaker 2:  can make fun of themselves. What is there like a winning formula for this?

105
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,925
Speaker 2:  I get, we'll talk about sort of what you laid out in your piece And I actually

106
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:09,525
Speaker 2:  have a case study that I think you nailed. But like how are

107
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:13,925
Speaker 2:  PR teams and publicists thinking about like the ingredients

108
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:17,605
Speaker 2:  to like a winning press tour? A winning press tour?

109
00:08:18,385 --> 00:08:21,565
Speaker 2:  It really depends on the type of person on the press tour.

110
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:25,205
Speaker 2:  For younger stars and especially musicians,

111
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,725
Speaker 2:  there's a kind of blanket strategy. Anything they can do, they

112
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:33,085
Speaker 2:  will do, they'll do the newsletters, they'll do the video podcasts.

113
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:37,485
Speaker 2:  I think traditional media to them, glossy covers and late

114
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:41,285
Speaker 2:  night sets feels like the furthest away. So you'll see those

115
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:45,165
Speaker 2:  people way more on your phone than you will in those traditional mediums.

116
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:48,165
Speaker 2:  But I think by the time they usually hit traditional mediums, it feels like

117
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:51,925
Speaker 2:  it's too late. Mm. I feel like by the time I saw Chapel Rone on

118
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:55,765
Speaker 2:  Colbert, I was like, this is already a famous person. Yeah. She, she maybe

119
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:58,965
Speaker 2:  doesn't need to be doing this. Yeah. The more

120
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:02,045
Speaker 2:  established celebrities will do a mix of both,

121
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:06,365
Speaker 2:  but there usually winds up being at least one silly thing.

122
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:10,685
Speaker 2:  Usually it's chicken related hot ones. It's so weird that it's all chicken.

123
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:14,685
Speaker 2:  I know. And it's like you kind of only get to do your chicken thing

124
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,485
Speaker 2:  once. Yeah, I would like to say, so it's like you do it and then you gotta

125
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:21,565
Speaker 2:  do something else next time you get to eat chicken once in your life and

126
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:25,085
Speaker 2:  no more. Yeah. You have to, you have to decide when you're gonna play your

127
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:28,525
Speaker 2:  chicken card. Yeah. Like some of the people who are hosting these shows,

128
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,405
Speaker 2:  writing these newsletters are celebrities in

129
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:36,405
Speaker 2:  and of Right? Like they are celebrities. That's sort of what's become interesting

130
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:40,085
Speaker 2:  is like I don't think we can keep feigning that someone like Amelia Dem Oldenberg

131
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:43,965
Speaker 2:  who does Chicken Shop Date or Britney Broski who does Royal Court

132
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:47,885
Speaker 2:  and a ton of like YouTube stuff. These aren't like regular people in

133
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:51,725
Speaker 2:  terms of like how you And I are. Yeah, sort of. I don't know. They're

134
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:55,325
Speaker 2:  also not media really. And they're not media, but they're doing

135
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:58,965
Speaker 2:  interviews and, and so there's this weird in-between

136
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:01,805
Speaker 2:  where maybe it's supposed to be kind of

137
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:06,045
Speaker 2:  jarring to see like Timothy Chalamet and Britney Broski in conversation,

138
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:10,205
Speaker 2:  But that actually makes perfect sense. These are just two famous people.

139
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:13,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah, absolutely. It's all become almost kind of the interview magazine

140
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:17,765
Speaker 2:  thing of celebrities interviewing celebrities. Yeah. Yeah. Just

141
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:21,245
Speaker 2:  like for the video squirrely era. Era. Yeah. Yeah.

142
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:25,605
Speaker 2:  In your piece you laid out like a couple different types

143
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:29,165
Speaker 2:  of celebrities such as the Fresh-Faced, aspiring

144
00:10:29,315 --> 00:10:33,165
Speaker 2:  Alister, the redemption seeker, the, like I said,

145
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:37,125
Speaker 2:  the kind of buzzy politician. So who is the redemption seeker? We're gonna

146
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:41,045
Speaker 2:  talk about a current redemption seeker on this circuit right now, but what

147
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:45,205
Speaker 2:  describe the redemption seeker? The redemption seeker is not

148
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:49,005
Speaker 2:  necessarily a canceled person. Frequently is not a canceled person,

149
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:52,925
Speaker 2:  but someone who has a perhaps less than savory

150
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:57,445
Speaker 2:  public relationship, maybe they've gone through a

151
00:10:57,445 --> 00:11:00,885
Speaker 2:  divorce, maybe there was a cheating scandal. Maybe there was some kind of

152
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:04,805
Speaker 2:  legal scandal that they were in. There's been drama on the sets

153
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:08,805
Speaker 2:  of one of their films or TV shows. Their

154
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:12,165
Speaker 2:  press tour has to become a kind of gentle

155
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:17,085
Speaker 2:  mea culpa. They can't just run through that thing and pretend like none

156
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:20,605
Speaker 2:  of that ever happened. There has to be some kind of tacit acknowledgement

157
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:25,165
Speaker 2:  or I think people just hound them. Maybe they don't see it, but in comments

158
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:28,725
Speaker 2:  they'll be like, what about this? Talk about this. And so there's a kind

159
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:32,685
Speaker 2:  of gentleness that lets this person be like, Hey, I'm

160
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:36,565
Speaker 2:  human, but also maybe be able to laugh about what's going

161
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:40,285
Speaker 2:  on with them a little bit. Yeah. And in your piece,

162
00:11:41,305 --> 00:11:45,245
Speaker 2:  you laid out a game plan for the redemption seeker. So there's Podcast

163
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:49,405
Speaker 2:  Pond, I love the names. Also there's Podcast Pond, then you do

164
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:53,085
Speaker 2:  guys being dudes, peak Chicken Coop after you are guys being

165
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:57,005
Speaker 2:  dudes. Then cover Story Creek, then daytime

166
00:11:57,145 --> 00:12:00,645
Speaker 2:  tv. And there's someone who I found

167
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:04,725
Speaker 2:  was pretty much matching this beat for Beat bar for Bar

168
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,645
Speaker 2:  and that's Brad Pitt. Yeah. He is promoting his F1 movie

169
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:13,605
Speaker 2:  and he has hit a lot of these things. He did the podcast interviews,

170
00:12:13,685 --> 00:12:17,285
Speaker 2:  a sort of sit down serious video podcast interviews.

171
00:12:17,785 --> 00:12:21,725
Speaker 2:  He was reading Thirst tweets on a Buzzfeed show. I think

172
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:24,605
Speaker 2:  we have a clip of that that we can roll. This is like Guys being Dudes Peak.

173
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:26,085
Speaker 2:  Let's see what it looks like. I

174
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:29,885
Speaker 10:  Have an overwhelming urge to lick Javier Barden. You know I say that one

175
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:33,125
Speaker 10:  too. I just say that one too. When you, the time when I'm not around all

176
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:36,565
Speaker 10:  the time. Overwhelming urge, just a lick. That's a lick

177
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:39,765
Speaker 10:  back, front side, just top to bottom

178
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:43,805
Speaker 2:  Comparing how Brad and how Javier Barde

179
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:48,765
Speaker 2:  approached the F1 press tour was very interesting. Talk more about that.

180
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:53,125
Speaker 2:  Javier Barda did sort of this circuit where he's sometimes very

181
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,845
Speaker 2:  silly, but he also went on the view to talk about Gaza

182
00:12:57,425 --> 00:13:00,765
Speaker 2:  and spent a lot of time on red carpets invoking Gaza and

183
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:05,205
Speaker 2:  made it very political in a way we have not seen stars of that

184
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:09,605
Speaker 2:  caliber do quite yet. I think it's maybe a little

185
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:13,205
Speaker 2:  different for Javier ridden because he's ostensibly like a European

186
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:17,565
Speaker 2:  star that he doesn't have to maybe totally play by the same rules or he doesn't

187
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:21,205
Speaker 2:  care to play by the same rules. But comparing that to

188
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:25,205
Speaker 2:  Brad Pitt playing Frisbee golf with Jimmy Fallon in tie dye

189
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:29,525
Speaker 2:  pajamas creates quite a strange contradiction.

190
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:33,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Of men of a certain age especially. Right. Yeah. It kind of suggests

191
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:36,845
Speaker 2:  to me too that like Brad Pitt is the redemption seeker and Javier

192
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:40,565
Speaker 2:  Barham is like maybe more of like the legend type

193
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:44,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Category. Also like on Guy being Dudes

194
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:47,885
Speaker 2:  Peak, I was like kind of struck by how exact your

195
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:51,725
Speaker 2:  prediction or your prescription of this was because he

196
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:55,005
Speaker 2:  literally did like a broy video with Lad Bible. You know what what I mean?

197
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:56,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah. Like it's just like this is guys being dudes.

198
00:13:57,195 --> 00:14:00,765
Speaker 10:  It's Aidas not Adidas. It's Adidas. I know. It's what I

199
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:05,125
Speaker 10:  It's biscuit, not cookie. No biscuits and gravy, man. May

200
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,765
Speaker 10:  It's chips you ever had biscuits and gravy. You are so American man.

201
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:09,605
Speaker 10:  Yeah.

202
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:16,165
Speaker 2:  He has done sort of the glossy magazine thing. He did a GQ

203
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,605
Speaker 2:  story that I kind of skimmed and then

204
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:24,925
Speaker 2:  command for Angelina Jolie and Kids. And there was like one mention

205
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,645
Speaker 2:  and it's completely non-specific. Yeah. It's where he said

206
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:32,645
Speaker 2:  his divorce being finalized isn't actually that major. Yeah. Which is crazy.

207
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:36,885
Speaker 2:  It's like, okay, it's the main thing. I believe you. Yeah. Why do you think

208
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:40,405
Speaker 2:  that the new media circuit, I mean I guess in this case this was a

209
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:43,965
Speaker 2:  traditional media thing, but across all these different stops that he made,

210
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:48,405
Speaker 2:  Angelina Jolie does not come up really. And it's interesting because

211
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:52,045
Speaker 2:  like we call it media, but mostly it's just like hanging out with friends

212
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:55,445
Speaker 2:  and your friends are not going to ask you on camera about allegations that

213
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:59,405
Speaker 2:  you like abused your wife. So it feels

214
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:02,725
Speaker 2:  very much like it is just an extension of

215
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:07,125
Speaker 2:  his own personal marketing. There's like no, he's not really bumping up against

216
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:10,845
Speaker 2:  any walls or like uncomfortable conversations.

217
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:15,565
Speaker 2:  Absolutely. I think his team is probably keeping him very, very protected

218
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:19,365
Speaker 2:  from any question. Yeah. He doesn't want to answer. And by doing

219
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:23,285
Speaker 2:  something like reading thirst tweets, it looks like he's being a kind of

220
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:26,925
Speaker 2:  vulnerable talking to Dex Shepherd about addiction. That's a kind of vulnerable,

221
00:15:27,945 --> 00:15:31,605
Speaker 2:  but it's not actually addressing the elephant

222
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:35,725
Speaker 2:  in the room. And I think with Pitt specifically and

223
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:39,365
Speaker 2:  with celebrities who I think have some kind of legal thing

224
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:42,325
Speaker 2:  attached to whatever they're seeking redemption from, it's very possible

225
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:46,125
Speaker 2:  that they like actually cannot talk about what's going on

226
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,725
Speaker 2:  in X, Y, Z terms as part of whatever

227
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:53,885
Speaker 2:  settlement that they've agreed on. But with Pit, it's that

228
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:58,045
Speaker 2:  then everything he does is so silly and he did this Fallon skit.

229
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:01,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Which is so funny in lieu of like even talking to Fallon. Yeah. So

230
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,845
Speaker 2:  tell us about the skit. They were playing Frisbee golf in the park.

231
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:08,845
Speaker 2:  Fallon is like, I had like an awesome weekend playing Frisbee golf with my

232
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:12,685
Speaker 2:  buddy and like we did some crazy shots and I'll show you the video. And it's

233
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:15,005
Speaker 2:  supposed to be, even then, it's supposed to be like surprising that like

234
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:18,645
Speaker 2:  Brad Pitt would even like talk to Jimmy Fallon. It's like, again, these are

235
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:22,365
Speaker 2:  two extremely famous people and they're both in these like tie dye

236
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,965
Speaker 2:  jammies and they're doing these really

237
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:29,445
Speaker 2:  edited and manipulated crazy Frisbee golf

238
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:30,885
Speaker 2:  shots. Here

239
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:34,085
Speaker 11:  We go, alright, four 20 Pink Pony Club

240
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:38,285
Speaker 11:  caricature Cat Rescue my month stilts, and finally hit

241
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:41,005
Speaker 11:  that idiot on the back of the head. BOL. Best o luck.

242
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:45,165
Speaker 2:  And what it's showing or proving is completely

243
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:49,165
Speaker 2:  incomprehensible to me, especially because they're only in the

244
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:52,565
Speaker 2:  shots where they're throwing and catching the Frisbee respectively. So it's

245
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:56,245
Speaker 2:  also not even really with or about them, but

246
00:16:56,545 --> 00:17:00,485
Speaker 2:  it just becomes like another silly little thing to prove that like

247
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,565
Speaker 2:  Serious Bread Pitt is not above having fun. Yeah. Once in a while.

248
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:08,805
Speaker 2:  I think that also kind of goes back to your earlier point where often

249
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:12,485
Speaker 2:  these appearances on these sort of the sort of like third rail

250
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,645
Speaker 2:  shows or podcasts or whatever are not about the thing that they're actually

251
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:20,485
Speaker 2:  working on. It is more just like them as a person, we need to

252
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:23,645
Speaker 2:  saturate your feeds. Right. With Brad Pitt's face,

253
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:28,525
Speaker 2:  I wanted to say also like looking through all of these stops

254
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:32,725
Speaker 2:  on the new media press tour. It is

255
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:37,005
Speaker 2:  so, so so striking how much it's mediated by like

256
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:40,845
Speaker 2:  third party platforms like TikTok and YouTube.

257
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:45,205
Speaker 2:  And I'm curious like how much of the quote unquote

258
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:48,965
Speaker 2:  algorithm comes in here, right? Like is it, is

259
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:52,485
Speaker 2:  it enough that celebrities just show up on Chicken shop date and show up

260
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:56,245
Speaker 2:  on Subway takes or show up on recess therapy? Or is there

261
00:17:56,245 --> 00:18:00,085
Speaker 2:  like some level of you throw all these things out there and see

262
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:03,565
Speaker 2:  what hits? Yeah. Are there any, I guess, show

263
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:07,005
Speaker 2:  appearances that you've seen that did not work? Whether, whether it was because

264
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:10,005
Speaker 2:  the algorithm didn't like it or because people didn't like it or because

265
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,965
Speaker 2:  it just was a weird fit? Yeah, absolutely. There are shows that don't

266
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:17,685
Speaker 2:  work all the time. I think. I mean they didn't need

267
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:20,845
Speaker 2:  something like this, but I think Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds doing Chicken

268
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,725
Speaker 2:  Shop Date, very unfunny, very strange, no

269
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:25,125
Speaker 2:  rapport.

270
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:27,125
Speaker 12:  Does your wife know they're on a date right now?

271
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:31,085
Speaker 13:  She does know that. She does, yes. Okay, good. And the only reason I'm allowed

272
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:35,365
Speaker 13:  and here is that you know, she's your number one fan. Ooh.

273
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:40,125
Speaker 13:  Oh my God. That is right. Brooke from Gossip Girl

274
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:41,325
Speaker 13:  Loves You.

275
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:42,205
Speaker 12:  Serena.

276
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:44,085
Speaker 12:  Serena,

277
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:45,245
Speaker 13:  Blair, Blair,

278
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:46,885
Speaker 12:  Serena.

279
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:51,365
Speaker 2:  I mean a movie like Deadpool does not need that. But I also think about,

280
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:55,445
Speaker 2:  say Kate Blanche doing her press run

281
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:59,405
Speaker 2:  for Black Bag. She's an amazing actor. Black Bag is a

282
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:03,325
Speaker 2:  great movie. She really hit the new media circuit this time around. She

283
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:07,245
Speaker 2:  went on Lost Cultas, she did Subway Takes and she spent a

284
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:11,005
Speaker 2:  lot of time on those shows. Either

285
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:14,765
Speaker 2:  kind of not finding the right tone of how to be on those shows

286
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:19,365
Speaker 2:  or just reiterating old bits that she's done. I think people talk about

287
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:22,645
Speaker 2:  when she gripes about like leaf blowers in every single interview. And it's

288
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:26,605
Speaker 2:  like, I don't know if this is like as charming or as relatable to

289
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:30,205
Speaker 2:  complain about her landscapers as Right. She thinks it is. No,

290
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:33,125
Speaker 14:  I, so that's one thing. It's like I don't understand leaf blowers And I

291
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,485
Speaker 14:  don't understand golf. No. See, this is the thing. Not only are leaf blowers

292
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,285
Speaker 14:  ugly and they're noise polluted and then your neighbors hate you. Yeah.

293
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:44,405
Speaker 14:  If I see a leaf blower, I will. I go from Naugh to a

294
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:48,605
Speaker 14:  thousand. I just, I cannot, it's all that is wrong with the human

295
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:48,885
Speaker 14:  race.

296
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:52,925
Speaker 2:  It's not really her fault. And I don't think it's like Las culture

297
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:56,405
Speaker 2:  East's fault either, but she's not media trained

298
00:19:57,025 --> 00:20:00,925
Speaker 2:  to be silly on camera and podcast for a whole

299
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:04,685
Speaker 2:  hour. She's not an especially silly person. Yeah. And what she does is

300
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:07,725
Speaker 2:  come off as kind of try hard and

301
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:11,965
Speaker 2:  disingenuine and it just doesn't really hit. Yeah. There's nothing

302
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:15,845
Speaker 2:  that stands out from it. And I think that happens all

303
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:19,645
Speaker 2:  the time. I think a lot of these publicists and teams are

304
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:23,445
Speaker 2:  just trying to blanket their person as far

305
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:27,485
Speaker 2:  and as much as their client is willing to go. And then you just

306
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:31,005
Speaker 2:  have to hope something hits. Yeah. At that point, who is

307
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:34,925
Speaker 2:  benefiting from like Cape Blanche being on Subway takes or whatever? Is it

308
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:38,645
Speaker 2:  Subway takes having like a massive win? Or is it

309
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:42,565
Speaker 2:  her kind of getting in front of maybe a younger, more online audience? Like

310
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:46,325
Speaker 2:  who is winning here? I don't think anyone is winning in that situation because

311
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:50,205
Speaker 2:  I think, think younger audiences are not caring about her on that show. And

312
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:54,565
Speaker 2:  maybe Subway Takes is benefiting slightly, but she's

313
00:20:54,565 --> 00:20:58,405
Speaker 2:  using recycled material Yeah. On there. And that's sort of what became frustrating

314
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:02,285
Speaker 2:  for many watching late night, is you would just hear the same stories over

315
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:06,245
Speaker 2:  and over again. And I think part of what the new media cycle

316
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:10,405
Speaker 2:  purports to do is that by like making people work in these

317
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:14,405
Speaker 2:  weird structures or games or these really long-winded conversations

318
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:18,805
Speaker 2:  that something notable will come out of this person

319
00:21:19,015 --> 00:21:22,765
Speaker 2:  pretending to have their guard down. Yeah. But if there isn't

320
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:26,365
Speaker 2:  that moment, it just, it kind of just doesn't happen. Yeah.

321
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:30,965
Speaker 2:  I wanna talk about another case study. Charlie XCX, her stock

322
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:34,085
Speaker 2:  went up massively in the last like year and a half. I, tell me if I'm wrong,

323
00:21:34,285 --> 00:21:37,885
Speaker 2:  I would put her in your structure as maybe the fresh faced aspiring

324
00:21:37,915 --> 00:21:41,525
Speaker 2:  Alister ish. Yeah. She's been around. She's definitely been around. But I

325
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:45,165
Speaker 2:  think that category also appeals to someone who's trying to jump up

326
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,845
Speaker 2:  a level. And I think for a long time she was a kind of niche

327
00:21:49,765 --> 00:21:53,565
Speaker 2:  celebrity. I would put someone like Carly Ra Jepsen in that category too,

328
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:57,525
Speaker 2:  which is like, she has fans. She's been around forever, but she

329
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:01,485
Speaker 2:  has no sort of Taylor Beyonce Yeah. Stadium type of

330
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:04,965
Speaker 2:  artist. Yeah. So what was Charlie Xc X's cycle

331
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:08,405
Speaker 2:  promoting her album Brat? Like, like what, what, what is the strategy there?

332
00:22:08,465 --> 00:22:12,365
Speaker 2:  She said yes to everything. I'm hard pressed to think of something she didn't

333
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:16,315
Speaker 2:  agree to do. And I think part of what

334
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:20,195
Speaker 2:  was so interesting about the Brat Remixes album, which I think is

335
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:23,715
Speaker 2:  great, is she kind of tacitly acknowledges like, I'm so tired. Yeah.

336
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:27,595
Speaker 2:  I've been like, I'm milking this thing, I'm milking this thing, I'm exhausted.

337
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:30,875
Speaker 2:  I've sort of lost what this thing is actually about,

338
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:35,235
Speaker 2:  which felt even more honest than some of the confessional nature of the

339
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:39,195
Speaker 2:  original Brad. But she agreed to do everything

340
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:43,435
Speaker 2:  and sometimes that really worked for her.

341
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:47,395
Speaker 2:  She had a great New York magazine cover. Yes she did. And you know,

342
00:22:47,395 --> 00:22:51,075
Speaker 2:  sometimes she's like on Howard Stern. Yeah. Which is sort of like, are the

343
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:54,435
Speaker 2:  stern listeners listening to Charlie XCX? The Howard Stern

344
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:58,435
Speaker 2:  interview is crazy. I'm actually gonna play a clip from my

345
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:02,195
Speaker 2:  computer because I was like cackling watching this. It, it's like a

346
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:03,635
Speaker 2:  generational clash.

347
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:07,555
Speaker 15:  Charlie XCX is here. Very excited to speak with her. Charlie's

348
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,755
Speaker 15:  out on her sweat tour. Wow. Great to see you. Do you like

349
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:13,915
Speaker 15:  Weezer? Are you, are you hip to Weezer?

350
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:15,035
Speaker 16:  Me?

351
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:16,795
Speaker 15:  Yeah, yeah,

352
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:20,875
Speaker 16:  Yeah. I How do you feel? I've, I've worked with R Rivers once

353
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:21,275
Speaker 16:  before.

354
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:23,755
Speaker 15:  No kidding. When was that?

355
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:26,675
Speaker 16:  Yeah, it was back in, when

356
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:27,755
Speaker 15:  Was that? On Sucker?

357
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:32,155
Speaker 16:  It was Howard. Yes. Yes. Yeah. And he's, he was really

358
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:35,475
Speaker 16:  cool actually. And I, I love that song that you were just playing.

359
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:40,475
Speaker 16:  So Yeah, I think they're, they're pretty cool. They're pretty good.

360
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:44,635
Speaker 2:  And this goes on for an hour and 10 minutes and it's like

361
00:23:45,485 --> 00:23:49,445
Speaker 2:  compared to her on Los Calista. It's just, I'll play

362
00:23:49,485 --> 00:23:53,125
Speaker 2:  a clip from that too because I was like, this is actually crazy how different

363
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:53,405
Speaker 2:  it is.

364
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:56,365
Speaker 17:  We're recording this, we're gonna release it. I'm closer to the album release.

365
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:58,245
Speaker 17:  But you're, you're going on Seth with, with Troy.

366
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:00,885
Speaker 18:  Yeah. Yeah. And then watch what happens live. Are you on with the housewife?

367
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:01,725
Speaker 18:  Do you know? No.

368
00:24:02,185 --> 00:24:03,485
Speaker 19:  I'm so sad about that.

369
00:24:03,665 --> 00:24:04,445
Speaker 18:  You're just on solo?

370
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:06,645
Speaker 19:  No, it's another man. Okay.

371
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:08,685
Speaker 18:  I

372
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:09,885
Speaker 19:  Couldn't tell you who it is. Yeah,

373
00:24:09,885 --> 00:24:12,565
Speaker 18:  Exactly. No, no problem. And I love that we will find out later who it is

374
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:15,045
Speaker 18:  when the episode airs and we'll be like, oh, that's who. And

375
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:16,125
Speaker 19:  I'll be like, it's, I

376
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:20,005
Speaker 18:  Love you. I love such a How Martha Vineyard. I love that show.

377
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:21,485
Speaker 18:  Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.

378
00:24:21,825 --> 00:24:23,605
Speaker 19:  No, I don't know. I think his name's Joe.

379
00:24:24,145 --> 00:24:28,125
Speaker 18:  Joe. Joe. That's, he sounds Biden, he sounds Joe Biden. It's

380
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:31,765
Speaker 18:  you and Joe Biden. And honestly, he's gonna ask you to be vp. Yeah.

381
00:24:31,835 --> 00:24:34,445
Speaker 18:  It's gonna be amazing. You're gonna really burn it down. Yeah.

382
00:24:34,915 --> 00:24:38,645
Speaker 2:  Even the way she is sitting is crazy. Completely. And she wild

383
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:42,845
Speaker 2:  with all love and respect seems exhausted in both of those. Yes. But in one,

384
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:46,765
Speaker 2:  she's tired and having fun. Yes. How much of the new media circuit

385
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:50,765
Speaker 2:  and appearances live strictly online never to be talked

386
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:54,685
Speaker 2:  about in person? Almost all of them. Almost all of them. It's a, it's a

387
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:58,605
Speaker 2:  really online format. I think it's rare that even some

388
00:24:58,885 --> 00:25:02,725
Speaker 2:  of these get like extended cuts beyond their like requisite minute

389
00:25:02,725 --> 00:25:05,845
Speaker 2:  and a half if there're Yeah. If they're really little things also. Yeah.

390
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:09,805
Speaker 2:  That's part of the new media circuit that feels really unique is

391
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:13,725
Speaker 2:  that like, like you said, a lot of these things are recorded for the

392
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:17,685
Speaker 2:  cut. Right. For, for the TikTok cut and

393
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:21,125
Speaker 2:  people will have quote unquote seen it, but they actually saw like

394
00:25:21,415 --> 00:25:24,925
Speaker 2:  45 seconds of that interview. Yeah. Nobody's watching. Nobody.

395
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:28,525
Speaker 2:  Well maybe people are, but I think most people are simply

396
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:32,165
Speaker 2:  scrolling to it and then scrolling away and not going to YouTube to watch

397
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:34,885
Speaker 2:  the full thing or whatever. Yeah. And I think what's interesting about a

398
00:25:34,885 --> 00:25:38,565
Speaker 2:  lot of these forms, there are certainly some that are the

399
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:41,725
Speaker 2:  exception to the rule. A lot of these you can really only do once. Yeah.

400
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:45,365
Speaker 2:  And most people are only doing them once. Yeah. There are a couple formats

401
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:48,965
Speaker 2:  like letterbox four favorites. Yes. Where they'll hit people

402
00:25:49,525 --> 00:25:52,805
Speaker 2:  multiple times and maybe they'll be like a different metric. I think that's

403
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:56,325
Speaker 2:  a really great like recyclable format. And I think some

404
00:25:57,015 --> 00:26:00,445
Speaker 2:  games that people have to do, there's a great, I mean I guess it's more of

405
00:26:00,445 --> 00:26:04,365
Speaker 2:  a radio show, but there's a great BBC radio game that

406
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:07,085
Speaker 2:  I've started to think is maybe the most genius of all of these new media

407
00:26:07,085 --> 00:26:10,205
Speaker 2:  things that I didn't get to include in my piece, which is they play a game

408
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:14,125
Speaker 2:  where the guest has to call three different famous people in their

409
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:17,205
Speaker 2:  phone. And the host have to guess whether the person when they pick up is

410
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:19,925
Speaker 2:  sitting or standing. Oh my God. That's really funny. It's so simple.

411
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:22,245
Speaker 18:  Yoyo,

412
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:24,885
Speaker 20:  Are you standing up or sitting down?

413
00:26:25,465 --> 00:26:27,445
Speaker 18:  I'm sitting down right now. Yes. Yes. We

414
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:30,805
Speaker 20:  A bunch of, I said he was gonna be sitting down. Yeah mate. I'm on the BBC

415
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:34,205
Speaker 20:  radio breakfast show and we are playing this game called Stand Up, sit Down.

416
00:26:34,555 --> 00:26:38,525
Speaker 2:  Whoever they call is always so annoyed. They're like, what do you what? And

417
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:41,605
Speaker 2:  then they just get the answer and then they're like, okay, see ya. Whoa.

418
00:26:41,795 --> 00:26:45,525
Speaker 2:  It's really quick. And it's like, this shouldn't work as well as it does,

419
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:48,885
Speaker 2:  but it is actually quite endearing. Yeah. It's also

420
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:52,965
Speaker 2:  just, I can't help but think it is made for short form video

421
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:56,325
Speaker 2:  Completely. Like that is a structure. The structure is, or like, I guess

422
00:26:56,345 --> 00:26:59,725
Speaker 2:  the, the mission is come up with a show that is like 30 seconds or

423
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:04,205
Speaker 2:  less and just do it, recycle it over and over and

424
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:08,085
Speaker 2:  over. Yeah. Something we were talking about with like red

425
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:11,985
Speaker 2:  carpet coverage at Vulture specifically is like if someone is coming

426
00:27:11,985 --> 00:27:15,785
Speaker 2:  down that line and sees the vulture microphone, do

427
00:27:15,785 --> 00:27:19,385
Speaker 2:  they know what is gonna come out of like my mouth? Mm. Because if they don't

428
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:23,185
Speaker 2:  know that maybe they don't wanna stop by when they see that letterbox

429
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:27,105
Speaker 2:  microphone, they know what's gonna happen. Yeah. There it feels

430
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:30,985
Speaker 2:  like a sort of an extension of a, a issue or

431
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:35,265
Speaker 2:  reality I guess that I think a lot about, which is like the line between

432
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:40,185
Speaker 2:  news and media and journalism and then everything else. And

433
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:44,025
Speaker 2:  increasingly it's just one bucket. Like when I was

434
00:27:44,025 --> 00:27:47,865
Speaker 2:  doing research for this show, I learned

435
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:51,745
Speaker 2:  that Kiki Palmer had decided not to run an interview she did with

436
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:55,865
Speaker 2:  Jonathan Majors in her like public statement about why they decided

437
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:59,865
Speaker 2:  not to run it. She was like, I'm a journalist and people

438
00:27:59,865 --> 00:28:03,065
Speaker 2:  should be able to trust that. Like I'm coming from a neutral place. I I give

439
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:05,865
Speaker 2:  people a platform to like say what they do And I don't judge. And I was like,

440
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:10,065
Speaker 2:  that's crazy. Yeah. You're, you're a, you're not a journalist. I love Kiki

441
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:13,225
Speaker 2:  Palmer, but you're not a journalist. No, not at all. And it, it, it's interesting

442
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:17,105
Speaker 2:  to me that like the thing about the Vulture mic, you,

443
00:28:17,205 --> 00:28:20,985
Speaker 2:  you don't have a quick are these people sitting or standing thing?

444
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:23,465
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Like you might ask like we a real thing we're working there, but Yeah.

445
00:28:23,465 --> 00:28:27,305
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But you might ask a real thing, right? Yeah, absolutely. And sometimes

446
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:31,345
Speaker 2:  like when I've done red carpets, you know, publicists will often come

447
00:28:31,345 --> 00:28:34,785
Speaker 2:  down the line first to be like, so-and-so's coming, you have two questions,

448
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:38,625
Speaker 2:  blah, blah blah. And sometimes they'll specify we're not doing silly questions.

449
00:28:39,005 --> 00:28:42,185
Speaker 2:  Oh wow. Don't do silly questions or don't do anything

450
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:46,425
Speaker 2:  adjacent to the movie. Sometimes we have like New York based questions. Okay.

451
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:49,545
Speaker 2:  New York magazine. Yeah. And they're like, don't do it movie only.

452
00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:54,345
Speaker 2:  And one time it was also told like, this person is

453
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:58,465
Speaker 2:  funny, my client is funny but they'll, you don't need

454
00:28:58,465 --> 00:29:02,305
Speaker 2:  to prompt them. Let them be funny on their own terms and don't set them up

455
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:05,625
Speaker 2:  with a silly question. They don't wanna do that. Mm. And it was like, okay,

456
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,505
Speaker 2:  I won't do that. And lo and behold like a serious question, got a funny answer

457
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:12,345
Speaker 2:  from this person. But I think the teams with

458
00:29:12,345 --> 00:29:16,305
Speaker 2:  these people keep them really protected from anything that they don't

459
00:29:16,305 --> 00:29:19,825
Speaker 2:  want to be doing. Yeah. Does the existence of the new media circuit

460
00:29:20,165 --> 00:29:22,705
Speaker 2:  change how you work as a journalist?

461
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:27,865
Speaker 2:  I think it puts a lot of pressure to

462
00:29:28,575 --> 00:29:32,425
Speaker 2:  come up with questions that have relatively short answers that are not

463
00:29:32,525 --> 00:29:36,145
Speaker 2:  yes or no, but are also not too long-winded or heady.

464
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:40,465
Speaker 2:  I think people are not really caring about the answers to those questions,

465
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:43,725
Speaker 2:  which is a shame 'cause it's questions like that that make me want to be

466
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:47,685
Speaker 2:  a journalist and, and probe and question like why

467
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:51,325
Speaker 2:  things are the way they are. Red carpets are really stressful 'cause there's

468
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:54,845
Speaker 2:  so little time everyone is like jockeying over each other that

469
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:58,925
Speaker 2:  it's not always the environment for something serious. But I think that's

470
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:02,885
Speaker 2:  also why like Javier Barde talking about Gaza on the red carpet

471
00:30:02,985 --> 00:30:06,045
Speaker 2:  is like he only really has like 90 seconds with some of these people and

472
00:30:06,045 --> 00:30:10,005
Speaker 2:  he's using that to do that, which I think is great. Yeah. There's

473
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:13,965
Speaker 2:  also the, I feel like maybe something we touched on a little bit, didn't

474
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:17,885
Speaker 2:  say directly is that like when people go on these shows, a lot of what

475
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:21,445
Speaker 2:  is discussed is very controlled. There are you, you show up to the, you know,

476
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:25,165
Speaker 2:  the person comes on set and I'm assuming a lot of these people are told do

477
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:28,205
Speaker 2:  not ask about this thing. Right? Yeah. Like these are not

478
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:32,765
Speaker 2:  organic in the way that maybe we would hope or maybe you know it it's

479
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:33,165
Speaker 2:  just more

480
00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:38,525
Speaker 2:  scripted almost. Yeah, completely. I think many of these things are

481
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:42,805
Speaker 2:  set in stone prearranged. I mean Kareem who does Subway

482
00:30:42,815 --> 00:30:46,725
Speaker 2:  takes recently told the story of how Kamala Harris was supposed to

483
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:50,605
Speaker 2:  be on, they had a pre-approved take that she was

484
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:54,045
Speaker 2:  gonna do and then at the last minute they switched it up and it all went

485
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:58,165
Speaker 2:  sideways and it never ran. Yeah. Yeah. And so it's also

486
00:30:58,195 --> 00:31:02,125
Speaker 2:  that these properties and these teams are not equipped

487
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:06,085
Speaker 2:  to improvise. Yeah. And that often is bad for everyone.

488
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. They also also, it feels like these teams of, you know, the people

489
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:12,845
Speaker 2:  who run these shows or do these shows often they're small, you scrappy

490
00:31:13,145 --> 00:31:16,605
Speaker 2:  and they're not equipped to push back either. For the most part

491
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,245
Speaker 2:  like this, this is a structure, you know, we talk a lot about like access

492
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:23,725
Speaker 2:  journalism and the way that that can skew coverage. But

493
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:27,605
Speaker 2:  this is like the final boss of that where like your

494
00:31:28,065 --> 00:31:31,965
Speaker 2:  guests, the reason you make the show, the thing you put produce depends on

495
00:31:31,965 --> 00:31:35,765
Speaker 2:  you having access to these people. Yeah. And If you go off script or If you

496
00:31:36,215 --> 00:31:40,085
Speaker 2:  break some sort of like agreement or If you insist on maybe

497
00:31:40,085 --> 00:31:43,445
Speaker 2:  holding their feet to the fire in a way they don't like, like that ends that.

498
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:47,285
Speaker 2:  Right. Yeah. Yeah. Our version now of holding someone's feet to the fire

499
00:31:47,345 --> 00:31:50,685
Speaker 2:  is making them feel uncomfortable in a very controlled way. Yeah. Whether

500
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:54,325
Speaker 2:  that's eating very spicy chicken or a kind of stilted

501
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:58,205
Speaker 2:  awkwardness that comes with some of these like more modern new media figures

502
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:02,005
Speaker 2:  like Harry Daniels that's holding feet to fire. Yeah. But it's not in actual

503
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,885
Speaker 2:  sort of content of what we learn from these people. Does

504
00:32:05,885 --> 00:32:09,285
Speaker 2:  all of this go away if like a platform

505
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:13,205
Speaker 2:  implodes? Like what is the future of Chicken Shop

506
00:32:13,205 --> 00:32:16,205
Speaker 2:  Date or Hot ones if like YouTube

507
00:32:16,975 --> 00:32:20,905
Speaker 2:  changes in some significant way? I think we're seeing it a little bit

508
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:24,385
Speaker 2:  with Chicken Shop Date where we're seeing Amelia Dem Oldenberg get brought

509
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:28,305
Speaker 2:  on as like an official red carpet spokesperson for the Oscars

510
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:32,185
Speaker 2:  and other awards shows. It's been interesting that they've been kind of

511
00:32:32,345 --> 00:32:36,065
Speaker 2:  pivoting her, like pushing her into like an Entertainment Tonight Space

512
00:32:36,505 --> 00:32:40,445
Speaker 2:  or like a talk show Right. Kind of space. And

513
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:44,365
Speaker 2:  I think that's a great fit for her honestly. I really, I really like what

514
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:48,245
Speaker 2:  she does And I think that show has a very clear ethos And I think she

515
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:52,165
Speaker 2:  has a really combative ethos that like, obviously it's not David

516
00:32:52,165 --> 00:32:55,205
Speaker 2:  Letterman but it calls to mind sort of the combative nature Yeah. Going on

517
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:58,965
Speaker 2:  Letterman. Yeah. Yeah. It's fun to watch. Yeah, absolutely. I think YouTube

518
00:32:58,965 --> 00:33:01,805
Speaker 2:  is only getting bigger and bigger. I don't know at this point what could

519
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:04,525
Speaker 2:  happen to YouTube that would change the metrics of some of these shows.

520
00:33:05,905 --> 00:33:08,285
Speaker 2:  You And I were at the YouTube upfronts. Yeah. And they were saying people

521
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:11,485
Speaker 2:  are watching YouTube on their TVs. Yeah. It's not just a phone thing. So

522
00:33:11,485 --> 00:33:15,125
Speaker 2:  I think we're gonna get longer and longer YouTube things. I mean

523
00:33:15,485 --> 00:33:19,325
Speaker 2:  I semi recently watched a five hour YouTube video over many days

524
00:33:19,995 --> 00:33:23,805
Speaker 2:  like that has become a very regular

525
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:28,045
Speaker 2:  way to consume media. Yeah. So to close this,

526
00:33:28,335 --> 00:33:32,245
Speaker 2:  let's say you are a guest host of a popular tech podcast who is filling in

527
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,925
Speaker 2:  for your coworker who is out on parental leave,

528
00:33:36,835 --> 00:33:40,205
Speaker 2:  what would you suggest? I would maybe it's like a fresh-faced

529
00:33:40,675 --> 00:33:44,445
Speaker 2:  wannabe, a lister. What shows should they go on hypothetically? Well

530
00:33:45,005 --> 00:33:48,805
Speaker 2:  I think you need to go on Call Her daddy. Mm. Yeah. I think you

531
00:33:49,355 --> 00:33:52,285
Speaker 2:  need to be playing up maybe sort of a woman in stem

532
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:57,245
Speaker 2:  angle to be like Yeah, you know, you know about tech and you know about

533
00:33:57,845 --> 00:34:01,565
Speaker 2:  computers, but like, hey, like you also love clothes. I'm relatable. Yeah,

534
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:05,365
Speaker 2:  completely. And maybe you wanna do like a perfectly imperfect

535
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,965
Speaker 2:  list and newsletter Yes. To pull in like a younger audience. Yes. But also

536
00:34:08,995 --> 00:34:12,805
Speaker 2:  show that you're sort of out there perusing, have kind of

537
00:34:12,805 --> 00:34:16,285
Speaker 2:  taste. I think for Fresh Face people,

538
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:20,885
Speaker 2:  a lot of what they need to do is be a kind of cultural taste maker or prove

539
00:34:20,885 --> 00:34:24,765
Speaker 2:  to some degree that they're both kind of approachable but also a real head.

540
00:34:24,765 --> 00:34:27,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. About their field. So maybe you could go in the Criterion Closet too.

541
00:34:27,325 --> 00:34:31,005
Speaker 2:  I was gonna say, should I go in the closet? Why not? Yeah, I would love to

542
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:33,925
Speaker 2:  go into the Criterion Closet I wanted to ask you, but I kind of forgot about

543
00:34:33,925 --> 00:34:37,205
Speaker 2:  that too. Like the way that brands or

544
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:42,405
Speaker 2:  existing companies like Manufacture a moment like that, like

545
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:46,085
Speaker 2:  Criterion definitely got it shit together and figured out

546
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:50,005
Speaker 2:  a way to make the closet a thing letterbox too with, with the, they did a

547
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:53,935
Speaker 2:  great, they did a great job of it And I think what they've done is kind

548
00:34:53,935 --> 00:34:57,575
Speaker 2:  of create a non gamified interview form

549
00:34:58,285 --> 00:35:02,125
Speaker 2:  that lets the person in question be as smart

550
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:06,045
Speaker 2:  as they are or want to be. And there's no wrong answers. Yeah. They're doing

551
00:35:06,045 --> 00:35:09,445
Speaker 2:  something where they can say absolutely anything. It'll look good, it'll

552
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:13,285
Speaker 2:  look cool. There's that great clip of Malcolm Washington

553
00:35:13,385 --> 00:35:16,645
Speaker 2:  and John David Washington in the Criterion Closet and Malcolm Washington

554
00:35:16,745 --> 00:35:20,725
Speaker 2:  is like talking about I think like Rome Air or some French director and

555
00:35:20,725 --> 00:35:24,125
Speaker 2:  like really going long. And then John David Washington just goes like, Jackie

556
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:27,365
Speaker 2:  Jen Boxhead. Know what I'm saying? And it's like, yeah, that's, those are

557
00:35:27,365 --> 00:35:31,285
Speaker 2:  both right. Yeah. Those are two correct ways to be doing that kind

558
00:35:31,285 --> 00:35:35,085
Speaker 2:  of thing. And I think those are what I'm most impressed by when I watch

559
00:35:35,085 --> 00:35:38,605
Speaker 2:  because it's both letting the subject have a ton of

560
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:42,325
Speaker 2:  control. But I do think a lot of the time they say really interesting things.

561
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:46,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And there's also, I think in those cases the audience

562
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:51,405
Speaker 2:  receives it well no matter what you do really, it's like a structure that,

563
00:35:51,755 --> 00:35:53,325
Speaker 2:  because there are no wrong answers,

564
00:35:54,915 --> 00:35:57,685
Speaker 2:  viewers will be like, so true Queen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like you took Pride

565
00:35:57,685 --> 00:36:01,565
Speaker 2:  and Prejudice starring Keira Knightly. Or they'll be like oh eight

566
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:05,365
Speaker 2:  and a half. Like you know what's up. Oh they're serious. They're serious.

567
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:08,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Is there any one of these shows you would wanna be

568
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:11,805
Speaker 2:  on where you're like, Ooh, that would be fun for me? I was thinking about

569
00:36:11,805 --> 00:36:15,405
Speaker 2:  this, prepping for this because I find,

570
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,365
Speaker 2:  I don't think I could do a podcast. It's just simply way too long. Okay.

571
00:36:19,365 --> 00:36:23,245
Speaker 2:  Like with you, this is fun to talk be, but like I don't want to

572
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:26,965
Speaker 2:  be in like snuggled up in a chair with Alex Cooper.

573
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:30,605
Speaker 2:  I feel like Timothy Schlamme did the thing where he just like went and bought

574
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:34,525
Speaker 2:  records with Nard war. Yeah. Right. Yeah, I would do that. Yeah, that would

575
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:38,245
Speaker 2:  be really fun. I would do the Criterion Closet. I'm not eating

576
00:36:38,245 --> 00:36:42,125
Speaker 2:  chicken on camera. Simply not doing that. So I think I, I like these

577
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:45,445
Speaker 2:  things where there's like an activity that you go and do. Yeah. What about

578
00:36:45,445 --> 00:36:48,445
Speaker 2:  you? What would you be on? I wanna go on Marin so bad. Mm. And now it's ending.

579
00:36:48,785 --> 00:36:52,205
Speaker 2:  Oh, it's kinda the worst news for me. But I, I really love him And I think

580
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:56,685
Speaker 2:  he was kind of a pioneer in the space ala Howard Stern, but

581
00:36:57,005 --> 00:37:00,605
Speaker 2:  I think Marin kind of pioneered what like the Dax Shepherd.

582
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:04,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Guys being dudes thing is now with the, which is like

583
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:07,725
Speaker 2:  confessional and sensitive while also being kind of masculine.

584
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:12,845
Speaker 2:  And I just think unlike many people doing what he does

585
00:37:12,845 --> 00:37:16,285
Speaker 2:  now, he's a really great interviewer. Yeah, yeah. I know. Push back a little.

586
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:18,845
Speaker 2:  People are bad at interviewing, he will push back and he will make people

587
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:22,205
Speaker 2:  uncomfortable. And the best episodes of that show are when both of them are

588
00:37:22,265 --> 00:37:26,045
Speaker 2:  so uncomfortable. Yeah, I, I guess I would also like to be on Dua Lip a's

589
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:29,885
Speaker 2:  book club podcast or whatever. Oh yeah, she actually seems like, obviously

590
00:37:29,885 --> 00:37:32,405
Speaker 2:  again these are controlled and she's definitely getting a list of things

591
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:36,365
Speaker 2:  not to ask about. But I would talk books with Dua Lipa I

592
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:39,405
Speaker 2:  think. And you heard it here first. We're available for bookings if anyone

593
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:42,525
Speaker 2:  wants us. Who? Who wants me? Who want me?

594
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:47,845
Speaker 2:  Thank you Fran. This fun. Thank you. We have to take a break

595
00:37:47,945 --> 00:37:51,205
Speaker 2:  now, but when we're back, we're going to talk with Sarah Fackrell about a

596
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:54,925
Speaker 2:  questionable legal tactic that is all the rage in Chicago. For some reason

597
00:37:55,215 --> 00:37:55,565
Speaker 2:  we'll

598
00:40:55,335 --> 00:40:59,255
Speaker 2:  t-shirts on Redbubble? A fan of the country music star Loop combs

599
00:40:59,515 --> 00:41:03,335
Speaker 2:  and a random Amazon seller called Accents all have in common.

600
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:07,935
Speaker 2:  They've all been accused of allegedly infringing on someone else's trademark

601
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:11,855
Speaker 2:  or design patent. But these lawsuits aren't just your run

602
00:41:11,855 --> 00:41:15,815
Speaker 2:  of the mill intellectual property law cases. They're just a handful of

603
00:41:15,815 --> 00:41:19,295
Speaker 2:  examples of a unique type of lawsuit that have become something of a trend.

604
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:23,255
Speaker 2:  In the last few years, the woman who is selling t-shirts online

605
00:41:23,675 --> 00:41:27,415
Speaker 2:  was sued by the owner of the Grumpy Cat trademark. I don't know If you remember

606
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:30,855
Speaker 2:  this, there was the kind of sad looking cat that

607
00:41:31,085 --> 00:41:34,925
Speaker 2:  spawned a million memes and a movie. She earned one

608
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:38,445
Speaker 2:  single dollar from selling a t-shirt and later found out that she was being

609
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:42,285
Speaker 2:  ordered to pay a hundred thousand dollars. In the Luke Combs case

610
00:41:42,355 --> 00:41:46,005
Speaker 2:  that went viral a few years ago, a Florida based fan who was selling

611
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:49,805
Speaker 2:  homemade drink tumblers on Amazon with combs likeness on them was

612
00:41:49,805 --> 00:41:53,685
Speaker 2:  ordered to pay $250,000 and she didn't even

613
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:57,645
Speaker 2:  know she was being sued. In the case of the Amazon seller accents,

614
00:41:58,025 --> 00:42:01,725
Speaker 2:  the China-based company had $50,000 in earnings frozen

615
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:05,725
Speaker 2:  in their Amazon seller account over products that a judge later ruled

616
00:42:05,945 --> 00:42:09,805
Speaker 2:  likely didn't infringe on a design patent at all. So how

617
00:42:09,805 --> 00:42:13,605
Speaker 2:  exactly does this legal tactic work and who benefits and who's at a disadvantage?

618
00:42:14,235 --> 00:42:18,205
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the weird and ruthless world of Schedule A cases and to

619
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:22,045
Speaker 2:  help me explain what's going on here, I have Sarah Fackrell, a professor

620
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:25,405
Speaker 2:  at Chicago Kent College of Law at Illinois Tech. Let's get into it.

621
00:42:25,995 --> 00:42:29,445
Speaker 2:  Okay Sarah, so why are these cases called

622
00:42:29,885 --> 00:42:31,925
Speaker 2:  schedule a lawsuits? Where does this name come from?

623
00:42:33,325 --> 00:42:36,815
Speaker 22:  Well that's a name that just sort of bubbled up from the way that

624
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:40,815
Speaker 22:  the main players started naming their cases. Stepping

625
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:44,615
Speaker 22:  back a little bit, this is a relatively new form of mass defendant

626
00:42:45,515 --> 00:42:49,215
Speaker 22:  IP litigation and the original cases started,

627
00:42:49,385 --> 00:42:53,335
Speaker 22:  there was something like big brand versus doe's one

628
00:42:53,335 --> 00:42:56,335
Speaker 22:  through a hundred or something, right? Like a John Doe lawsuit you might

629
00:42:56,335 --> 00:43:00,015
Speaker 22:  have heard of. And then eventually they started saying, well it's

630
00:43:00,155 --> 00:43:04,135
Speaker 22:  big brand versus the defendants that are listed on Schedule

631
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:08,135
Speaker 22:  A, which is just a separate document that was filed separately

632
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:12,095
Speaker 22:  apart from the complaint, at least in some courts. And

633
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:15,655
Speaker 22:  so what they were doing was instead of saying this is Apple versus Samsung,

634
00:43:15,795 --> 00:43:18,535
Speaker 22:  and that's right there on the face of the complaint, they were saying here's

635
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:20,695
Speaker 22:  Apple versus a bunch of people and we're not gonna tell you who their names

636
00:43:20,695 --> 00:43:24,135
Speaker 22:  are. At least not publicly, at least not at first.

637
00:43:25,155 --> 00:43:28,855
Speaker 22:  And so a lot of people, myself included, started calling these schedule

638
00:43:28,975 --> 00:43:32,495
Speaker 22:  a cases 'cause it was just an easy way to refer to them. And this model,

639
00:43:32,565 --> 00:43:35,975
Speaker 22:  even though in practice the case names can differ,

640
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:39,615
Speaker 22:  that separate document can have a different name. For example, some of them

641
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:43,255
Speaker 22:  call it exhibit A or whatever it, it can have a different name,

642
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:47,495
Speaker 22:  but the major players started captioning these cases

643
00:43:47,935 --> 00:43:51,255
Speaker 22:  Schedule A. And so that's the name that seems to have stuck, at least with

644
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:53,055
Speaker 22:  practitioners and judges here in Chicago.

645
00:43:54,515 --> 00:43:57,175
Speaker 2:  And on the schedule a form, it's not just like a couple

646
00:43:57,965 --> 00:44:01,615
Speaker 2:  storefronts or defendants named, right? It's like dozens, sometimes

647
00:44:01,735 --> 00:44:03,375
Speaker 2:  even hundreds. What have you seen there?

648
00:44:04,485 --> 00:44:08,215
Speaker 22:  Yeah, so I will say I have not been able to

649
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:12,295
Speaker 22:  exhaustively empirically study all of these cases yet. It's a

650
00:44:12,645 --> 00:44:16,575
Speaker 22:  fire hose. It's literally impossible to to keep track of everything. But

651
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:20,455
Speaker 22:  what I've seen from my impre imperfect efforts to pay attention to

652
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:24,335
Speaker 22:  what's going on is I've seen anywhere from a

653
00:44:24,335 --> 00:44:28,215
Speaker 22:  couple dozen on the low end, maybe even fewer, sometimes

654
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:32,125
Speaker 22:  even maybe three or four. But usually the dozens is

655
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:35,965
Speaker 22:  the low end to over a thousand and they don't sue the

656
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:39,445
Speaker 22:  defendants using their legal names. This is another big difference between

657
00:44:39,565 --> 00:44:43,365
Speaker 22:  a schedule a case and a normal case. So in a normal case, If you wanna sue

658
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:46,085
Speaker 22:  someone, you have to figure out what their actual legal name is and if it's

659
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:49,805
Speaker 22:  an individual, what's their actual name, which can be hard if you're suing

660
00:44:49,805 --> 00:44:53,285
Speaker 22:  like a celebrity or something. And if it's a company, right, is it Starbucks

661
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:56,565
Speaker 22:  Corp or Starbucks Inc or whatever you're supposed to figure that out and

662
00:44:56,565 --> 00:45:00,165
Speaker 22:  sue them under their proper name. In these cases though, the plaintiffs

663
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:03,925
Speaker 22:  say, well we don't know what the real names of these sellers are, so please

664
00:45:03,945 --> 00:45:07,805
Speaker 22:  let us use their online storefront name or some

665
00:45:07,885 --> 00:45:11,605
Speaker 22:  other similar signifier as an alias. So they're suing people

666
00:45:11,695 --> 00:45:15,445
Speaker 22:  under aliases. That's where these names come from that you'll see

667
00:45:15,515 --> 00:45:18,805
Speaker 22:  when the defendants are able to show up, it's usually their storefront name.

668
00:45:19,345 --> 00:45:22,245
Speaker 22:  And then eventually we may or may not actually learn their real name.

669
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:26,525
Speaker 2:  Hmm. What does putting all of these storefronts onto

670
00:45:26,705 --> 00:45:30,685
Speaker 2:  one copyright or design patent suit do? Like what is

671
00:45:30,685 --> 00:45:34,485
Speaker 2:  the benefit that plaintiffs get by throwing them all onto one

672
00:45:34,485 --> 00:45:37,165
Speaker 2:  form, whether it's called schedule A or exhibit A or whatever it is.

673
00:45:38,145 --> 00:45:41,525
Speaker 22:  The reason why you wanna sue a thousand people together instead of filing

674
00:45:41,685 --> 00:45:44,765
Speaker 22:  a thousand different lawsuits is because it saves you money.

675
00:45:45,195 --> 00:45:46,725
Speaker 2:  Classic, classic.

676
00:45:48,185 --> 00:45:51,445
Speaker 22:  It saves you money and perhaps time and effort, right? But money's the big

677
00:45:51,445 --> 00:45:55,285
Speaker 22:  one. You're supposed to pay a fee of about $400 for a federal lawsuit.

678
00:45:56,145 --> 00:45:59,285
Speaker 22:  So if I file one lawsuit against a hundred defendants,

679
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,795
Speaker 22:  that's a lot cheaper than filing a hundred defendants, a 400 bucks pop,

680
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:07,755
Speaker 22:  right? So they wanna save money is the big thing.

681
00:46:07,815 --> 00:46:11,715
Speaker 22:  And I think that's why bundling these cases is so important to this

682
00:46:11,955 --> 00:46:14,995
Speaker 22:  business model. They could literally sue everyone separately, but not if

683
00:46:14,995 --> 00:46:15,635
Speaker 22:  they wanna make money.

684
00:46:16,155 --> 00:46:19,995
Speaker 2:  I wanna back up a second and just be like, I think we should say that people

685
00:46:20,055 --> 00:46:23,835
Speaker 2:  can agree that the internet does have a lot of cheap junk.

686
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:28,315
Speaker 2:  There are products for sale that infringe on someone else's rights. We've

687
00:46:28,315 --> 00:46:32,035
Speaker 2:  seen, you know, designers or businesses complain about this constantly

688
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:35,955
Speaker 2:  with valid reasons to be upset and you know,

689
00:46:35,955 --> 00:46:39,675
Speaker 2:  the knockoffs or the ES or the infringing products are everywhere, but

690
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:44,275
Speaker 2:  schedule A suits work differently than maybe a traditional

691
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:48,275
Speaker 2:  trademark case might. So what are the different moving parts here that

692
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:51,275
Speaker 2:  actually make these suits so effective for plaintiffs?

693
00:46:52,355 --> 00:46:55,795
Speaker 22:  Absolutely. And this larger question of how do we police our IP rights on

694
00:46:55,795 --> 00:46:59,075
Speaker 22:  the internet has lasted as long as there's been an internet, right? This

695
00:46:59,075 --> 00:47:02,275
Speaker 22:  is not a new question, this is just a new evolution

696
00:47:02,855 --> 00:47:06,595
Speaker 22:  as Professor Eric Goldman has written about who studied sort of the

697
00:47:06,595 --> 00:47:10,275
Speaker 22:  evolution on the trademark side. We've also seen on the copyright side,

698
00:47:10,275 --> 00:47:13,155
Speaker 22:  some people who used to file mass copyright lawsuits are now filing schedule

699
00:47:13,235 --> 00:47:17,075
Speaker 22:  A cases. So you're right that this is an old problem, but this is a new

700
00:47:17,355 --> 00:47:20,795
Speaker 22:  solution and it's actually pretty clever and sophisticated when it's done

701
00:47:20,795 --> 00:47:24,395
Speaker 22:  right. So the heart and soul of a Schedule eight case

702
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:28,755
Speaker 22:  is the asset freeze. The lawyers who perfected this

703
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:32,325
Speaker 22:  litigation model figured out a way to convince judges

704
00:47:32,515 --> 00:47:36,245
Speaker 22:  they, they should not only allow them to sue hundreds of people altogether,

705
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:40,565
Speaker 22:  not only let them sue them without knowing their real legal names,

706
00:47:41,145 --> 00:47:43,885
Speaker 22:  not only let them sue them in the form of their choice, which is often,

707
00:47:43,905 --> 00:47:47,485
Speaker 22:  but not always Chicago. But also to let them freeze

708
00:47:47,985 --> 00:47:51,645
Speaker 22:  the accounts of these defendants before they even know they've been

709
00:47:52,195 --> 00:47:56,005
Speaker 22:  sued in legal language we call as an ex parte TRO or a

710
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:59,605
Speaker 22:  temporary restraining order and they come in and say, Hey judge, look these

711
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:02,925
Speaker 22:  defendants, we have reason to believe that they are all bad and nefarious

712
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:06,845
Speaker 22:  Chinese counterfeiters or at least foreign counterfeiters, but they often

713
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:10,325
Speaker 22:  call them Chinese, which is a, a separate issue in these cases, right? Yeah.

714
00:48:10,325 --> 00:48:13,365
Speaker 22:  They say we have reason to believe that these are all nefarious foreign

715
00:48:13,365 --> 00:48:16,885
Speaker 22:  counterfeiters and judge, unless you freeze their Amazon seller account

716
00:48:16,885 --> 00:48:20,045
Speaker 22:  right now, unless you freeze their eBay account right now, unless you freeze

717
00:48:20,045 --> 00:48:23,725
Speaker 22:  their PayPal account right now, they are going to abscond with their ill-gotten

718
00:48:23,815 --> 00:48:27,725
Speaker 22:  gains and just disappear into, you know, the far reaches of

719
00:48:27,725 --> 00:48:31,405
Speaker 22:  the internet. And for a variety of reasons they've been able to convince

720
00:48:31,405 --> 00:48:35,365
Speaker 22:  judges that this is correct, even when the defendants don't actually

721
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:38,765
Speaker 22:  fit those profiles. And so this key that they go in,

722
00:48:39,115 --> 00:48:42,285
Speaker 22:  they find a bunch of sellers on, you know, name your platform,

723
00:48:42,915 --> 00:48:46,645
Speaker 22:  eBay, Etsy, whatever you have. And they say, judge,

724
00:48:46,945 --> 00:48:50,685
Speaker 22:  we think they infringe our rights. Here's a little proof and please

725
00:48:50,685 --> 00:48:52,565
Speaker 22:  freeze all their accounts so we can figure this out.

726
00:48:53,345 --> 00:48:56,245
Speaker 2:  And most of the time that's working right? Like most of the time the judges

727
00:48:56,305 --> 00:48:56,925
Speaker 2:  are like, sure,

728
00:48:57,795 --> 00:49:01,245
Speaker 22:  Yeah, we're still, I, I'm actually working with a co-author trying to get

729
00:49:01,245 --> 00:49:04,125
Speaker 22:  some good empirical data on this. But just anecdotally,

730
00:49:05,065 --> 00:49:08,485
Speaker 22:  it seems like a rubber stamp a lot. Not all judges,

731
00:49:09,515 --> 00:49:12,925
Speaker 22:  some judges have become skeptical, but a lot of judges for

732
00:49:13,255 --> 00:49:17,125
Speaker 22:  quite a while now seem to have accepted these cookie cutter

733
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:20,645
Speaker 22:  boilerplate complaints and said, oh here's another one and we're gonna freeze

734
00:49:20,845 --> 00:49:23,685
Speaker 22:  that and freeze that. And you can imagine this is a really, really, really

735
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:27,685
Speaker 22:  powerful remedy. If you're in a lawsuit, you have

736
00:49:27,815 --> 00:49:31,805
Speaker 22:  their money and you've, they often usually freeze the whole

737
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:35,725
Speaker 22:  account, not just whatever you sold. So let's say that I sold

738
00:49:35,745 --> 00:49:38,885
Speaker 22:  one accused product for 4 99, but I happen to have

739
00:49:39,005 --> 00:49:42,205
Speaker 22:  $350,000 in my account. That's what gets frozen

740
00:49:42,915 --> 00:49:46,175
Speaker 22:  and it's sort of just luck based on the disbursement schedule. And so

741
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:50,695
Speaker 22:  you could imagine If you were a defendant and you've got your money

742
00:49:50,845 --> 00:49:54,415
Speaker 22:  tied up, right, varying degrees, maybe it's, you know, nothing 'cause you

743
00:49:54,415 --> 00:49:57,215
Speaker 22:  just got a disbursement, maybe it's a thousand bucks, maybe it's a hundred

744
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:01,415
Speaker 22:  thousand bucks. That's not normally how we start litigation. Normally you

745
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,495
Speaker 22:  find out that someone sued you and we have these little steps we take, but

746
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:08,375
Speaker 22:  these defendants often I'm told find out

747
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:11,855
Speaker 22:  they have been sued when they notice their account's frozen. Yeah.

748
00:50:12,155 --> 00:50:14,855
Speaker 22:  And then the platform's like, hey, go talk to the plaintiff's lawyers.

749
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:19,095
Speaker 22:  Yeah. And If you might not have even seen the complaint or the papers or

750
00:50:19,095 --> 00:50:21,975
Speaker 22:  have had any notice at all and that's extraordinary.

751
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:25,895
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I wanted to pick up on one of the cases that I mentioned earlier,

752
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:29,885
Speaker 2:  this Amazon seller accents, which I should clarify for

753
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:33,965
Speaker 2:  listeners that it's spelled not like accents. It's spelled

754
00:50:34,285 --> 00:50:38,205
Speaker 2:  a CC capital E-N-C-Y-C. And I had to go to like

755
00:50:38,465 --> 00:50:41,045
Speaker 2:  the attorney that represents accents to be like, can you please tell me how

756
00:50:41,045 --> 00:50:44,885
Speaker 2:  you pronounce this name? But it's called accents. It is a China

757
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:48,965
Speaker 2:  based Amazon seller. They sell like really random things that you might need

758
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:52,845
Speaker 2:  around the house, you know, hooks or like sticky, like suction

759
00:50:52,905 --> 00:50:56,885
Speaker 2:  cup things for you know, hanging something or whatever. And what you

760
00:50:56,885 --> 00:51:00,445
Speaker 2:  were describing, this TRO, this temporary restraining order happened exactly

761
00:51:00,465 --> 00:51:04,405
Speaker 2:  to them. They were selling one hook that was like, you put

762
00:51:04,405 --> 00:51:08,325
Speaker 2:  it on in your closet and you can hang a handbag from the hook. It's

763
00:51:08,325 --> 00:51:12,165
Speaker 2:  like a double-sided hook. They were selling those hooks and they got an email

764
00:51:12,305 --> 00:51:15,885
Speaker 2:  saying, Hey, there's an issue with this listing. We've taken it down and

765
00:51:15,995 --> 00:51:19,765
Speaker 2:  also your seller account is frozen. The money ended up growing to

766
00:51:19,915 --> 00:51:23,725
Speaker 2:  like $50,000 because they were still making sales on their

767
00:51:23,725 --> 00:51:26,805
Speaker 2:  other products, which were not affected. They just couldn't get their money

768
00:51:26,865 --> 00:51:30,445
Speaker 2:  out. And like you said, they had no idea that they were being named in a

769
00:51:30,565 --> 00:51:34,525
Speaker 2:  schedule a suit until it was kind of too late for them. Right. Already

770
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:37,805
Speaker 2:  their business is being thrown in disarray, it's around the holidays, they

771
00:51:37,805 --> 00:51:41,565
Speaker 2:  can't, they can't get their earnings. So I wanted to ask

772
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:45,415
Speaker 2:  just like, is this something that should be happening? Is

773
00:51:45,415 --> 00:51:49,335
Speaker 2:  this normal, I guess for like you said for Schedule A, it kind

774
00:51:49,335 --> 00:51:53,215
Speaker 2:  of has become extraordinary, but a temporary restraining order like this,

775
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:56,735
Speaker 2:  like you said, is only supposed to happen for very, very specific

776
00:51:57,125 --> 00:51:59,775
Speaker 2:  reasons and very rarely applied.

777
00:52:00,685 --> 00:52:04,175
Speaker 22:  Yeah. In theory a temporary restraining order is supposed to

778
00:52:04,975 --> 00:52:08,935
Speaker 22:  maintain the status quo so we can figure out what's going on, right? So,

779
00:52:08,995 --> 00:52:12,895
Speaker 22:  so to take like a real property example, if a company was going to demolish

780
00:52:12,935 --> 00:52:15,775
Speaker 22:  a building where I'd painted a mural And I thought I had a right to have

781
00:52:15,775 --> 00:52:19,615
Speaker 22:  them not demolish my mural. If I wait until they demolished the

782
00:52:19,615 --> 00:52:22,895
Speaker 22:  whole building, it's too late. So I might go to the court and ask for a

783
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:25,135
Speaker 22:  temporary restraining order and be like, Hey, don't let them bulldoze the

784
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:28,655
Speaker 22:  building until we can figure out the art law issue. That's sort of a classic

785
00:52:28,765 --> 00:52:32,695
Speaker 22:  example of A TRO. This is different because

786
00:52:32,705 --> 00:52:36,175
Speaker 22:  again, normally defendants are allowed to use their money while litigation's

787
00:52:36,175 --> 00:52:39,335
Speaker 22:  going on. And sometimes these ts are written incredibly broadly.

788
00:52:39,965 --> 00:52:42,415
Speaker 22:  Like sometimes they're just like, okay, you can't use your Amazon account.

789
00:52:42,595 --> 00:52:46,295
Speaker 22:  But I've seen some recently that are more like, you can't spend any money

790
00:52:46,355 --> 00:52:47,335
Speaker 22:  in any bank account.

791
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:48,535
Speaker 2:  How do you live?

792
00:52:49,175 --> 00:52:51,975
Speaker 22:  I, that's the thing, right? How do you buy food? How do you hire a lawyer?

793
00:52:52,445 --> 00:52:56,375
Speaker 22:  More importantly, right? So what happened with accents is not unusual

794
00:52:56,475 --> 00:52:59,455
Speaker 22:  on its facts, but what's unusual about it is they were able to get a lawyer.

795
00:52:59,925 --> 00:53:00,215
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

796
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:02,615
Speaker 22:  That doesn't always happen for a variety of reasons.

797
00:53:03,925 --> 00:53:07,055
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's something I wanted to talk about too is just, you know, it feels

798
00:53:07,055 --> 00:53:10,335
Speaker 2:  like there's a real power imbalance in a lot of these cases because

799
00:53:10,825 --> 00:53:13,735
Speaker 2:  there are, sometimes they're big companies, but sometimes they're not that

800
00:53:13,895 --> 00:53:17,695
Speaker 2:  big who are actually going after all of these sellers. But by and large,

801
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,655
Speaker 2:  from what I understand, the people being named as defendants are like

802
00:53:21,845 --> 00:53:25,645
Speaker 2:  individuals selling something they're making, or foreign

803
00:53:26,045 --> 00:53:28,845
Speaker 2:  companies who maybe like don't speak the language, don't know any lawyers

804
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:31,805
Speaker 2:  in Chicago that they can hire to defend them. And

805
00:53:32,485 --> 00:53:36,005
Speaker 2:  accent's attorney told me that, you know, most of the time you go to court

806
00:53:36,305 --> 00:53:39,325
Speaker 2:  and there can be hundreds of defendants named and there's not a single person

807
00:53:39,495 --> 00:53:43,365
Speaker 2:  right in the courtroom there to represent these

808
00:53:43,365 --> 00:53:45,965
Speaker 2:  people. It's just the plaintiff's kind of pushing things along.

809
00:53:46,795 --> 00:53:49,885
Speaker 22:  Yeah, we don't actually have a lot of good information about who the defendants

810
00:53:49,885 --> 00:53:53,765
Speaker 22:  are actually, because they're named using aliases. And

811
00:53:53,765 --> 00:53:57,645
Speaker 22:  because of all the secrecy, a lot of these records remain under seal

812
00:53:57,705 --> 00:54:01,325
Speaker 22:  for quite a long time, if not forever. And so we can't really know

813
00:54:02,025 --> 00:54:05,045
Speaker 22:  systematically who's being sued. But like you said, as far as we can tell,

814
00:54:05,155 --> 00:54:08,125
Speaker 22:  it's a variety of companies. Sometimes it's just an individual, sometimes

815
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:11,285
Speaker 22:  it's a little company, sometimes they're in America, sometimes they're not.

816
00:54:11,945 --> 00:54:15,685
Speaker 22:  We don't really know as outsiders, right? I mean, maybe some of the plaintiff's

817
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:19,045
Speaker 22:  lawyers have some insights that we don't. So that

818
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:23,005
Speaker 22:  asymmetry in these cases is really, really striking. And even when

819
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:26,325
Speaker 22:  there's a hearing, it's often pretty quick. I've seen

820
00:54:26,785 --> 00:54:30,525
Speaker 22:  judges say, okay, plaintiffs, you can have your TRO, we're going to have

821
00:54:30,525 --> 00:54:33,525
Speaker 22:  a preliminary injunction hearing, which is what you're supposed to do If

822
00:54:33,525 --> 00:54:37,445
Speaker 22:  you want a longer initial freeze. And

823
00:54:37,555 --> 00:54:41,045
Speaker 22:  sometimes they only have a matter of days. And so

824
00:54:41,275 --> 00:54:44,285
Speaker 22:  imagine that you are who the plaintiffs always say these defendants are,

825
00:54:44,495 --> 00:54:48,445
Speaker 22:  right? You are someone in another country who is selling products

826
00:54:48,445 --> 00:54:52,205
Speaker 22:  online and you find out in the middle of the night that there's gonna be

827
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,965
Speaker 22:  a hearing in two days in some city you've never even heard of in the middle

828
00:54:55,965 --> 00:54:59,845
Speaker 22:  of North America, right? Like how, how do you

829
00:54:59,845 --> 00:55:02,685
Speaker 22:  even start to defend yourself? I mean, I wouldn't know what I would do if

830
00:55:02,685 --> 00:55:05,925
Speaker 22:  I was in the other shoes, right? If someone sued me in China, And I'm a

831
00:55:05,925 --> 00:55:09,565
Speaker 22:  lawyer, I'm a law professor, I have connections. I don't know what you do

832
00:55:09,665 --> 00:55:13,045
Speaker 22:  If you are just a normal person. And so

833
00:55:13,735 --> 00:55:17,325
Speaker 22:  these cases move so quickly because they're motivated by this

834
00:55:17,325 --> 00:55:21,205
Speaker 22:  narrative of, you know, bad, nasty, nefarious people need to be, you know,

835
00:55:21,205 --> 00:55:23,845
Speaker 22:  clamped down on, or it'll just be whack-a-mole on the internet forever.

836
00:55:25,025 --> 00:55:29,005
Speaker 22:  But what happens when that's not the case? Parties can't always fight every

837
00:55:29,145 --> 00:55:32,725
Speaker 22:  bad claim, even the ones that lack merit, right? Sometimes it's just

838
00:55:33,345 --> 00:55:37,245
Speaker 22:  not worth it, right? Hey, that hook wasn't making us money anyway. Let's

839
00:55:37,245 --> 00:55:41,045
Speaker 22:  just quit selling it. Right? Or that t-shirt, no one bought it anyway. We

840
00:55:41,045 --> 00:55:44,885
Speaker 22:  don't care. We'll just cancel, we'll quit. So there's a certain threshold

841
00:55:44,885 --> 00:55:48,245
Speaker 22:  of how much even has to be frozen before rationally, economically, if you're

842
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:51,285
Speaker 22:  in a position where you can make those sorts of judgments even makes sense

843
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:52,085
Speaker 22:  to call a lawyer.

844
00:55:52,555 --> 00:55:56,165
Speaker 2:  Something that struck me in all three of the cases, the grumpy cat,

845
00:55:56,355 --> 00:56:00,125
Speaker 2:  Luke Combs, and then accents case, is that the

846
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:03,965
Speaker 2:  actual earnings that these defendants at least who are responding to the

847
00:56:03,965 --> 00:56:07,765
Speaker 2:  suit are reporting are so small. The grumpy Cat T t-shirt seller

848
00:56:07,955 --> 00:56:11,485
Speaker 2:  made literally $1. She sold one shirt

849
00:56:12,265 --> 00:56:16,205
Speaker 2:  and it didn't have like the photo of the grumpy cat on

850
00:56:16,205 --> 00:56:19,085
Speaker 2:  it. It was just like a cat that looked kind of sad, an illustration of a

851
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:22,645
Speaker 2:  cat that looked kind of sad. The Luke Combs fan, which that story also kind

852
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:26,125
Speaker 2:  of blew up because he, I think, tried to make it right afterwards. But the

853
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:29,925
Speaker 2:  Luke Combs fans sold like $380 of homemade

854
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:33,485
Speaker 2:  merch and then accents sold less than

855
00:56:33,485 --> 00:56:37,325
Speaker 2:  $500 of these handbag hooks. It's not like their main seller. They, I don't

856
00:56:37,325 --> 00:56:40,685
Speaker 2:  think care if they sell these handbag hooks, but the

857
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:44,725
Speaker 2:  plaintiffs are seeking sort of enormous default judgments.

858
00:56:45,105 --> 00:56:49,005
Speaker 2:  So, you know, a hundred thousand dollars, $250,000, 900,000

859
00:56:49,165 --> 00:56:52,805
Speaker 2:  I think was the accents case for, you know,

860
00:56:52,805 --> 00:56:56,565
Speaker 2:  500 bucks of hooks that a judge later found likely weren't infringing in

861
00:56:56,565 --> 00:57:00,445
Speaker 2:  the first place. So like how do plaintiffs justify this?

862
00:57:01,465 --> 00:57:05,045
Speaker 22:  That's a great question and it's actually another

863
00:57:05,305 --> 00:57:09,005
Speaker 22:  really big concern with those freezes that I talked about

864
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:12,605
Speaker 22:  before. So what the plaintiffs do is they say, Hey, we're entitled to do

865
00:57:12,605 --> 00:57:16,165
Speaker 22:  this freeze because we could get this kind of remedy that qualifies, at

866
00:57:16,165 --> 00:57:19,965
Speaker 22:  least theoretically under their theory of Supreme Court precedent, which

867
00:57:20,265 --> 00:57:23,565
Speaker 22:  hasn't really been strongly tested yet. Certainly not any court of appeals

868
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,965
Speaker 22:  that I know, but we are eligible for potentially this type of damages. So

869
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:30,765
Speaker 22:  you should let us freeze their assets is the argument. But then they turn

870
00:57:30,765 --> 00:57:34,125
Speaker 22:  around at the end and ask for a totally different kind of

871
00:57:34,915 --> 00:57:38,805
Speaker 22:  damages. Ones that would not justify that initial

872
00:57:38,895 --> 00:57:42,885
Speaker 22:  asset freeze. And a number of judges, well at

873
00:57:42,885 --> 00:57:45,765
Speaker 22:  least a couple of judges have started to

874
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:50,565
Speaker 22:  really bristle at that, right? You are coming in

875
00:57:50,565 --> 00:57:53,925
Speaker 22:  and saying you want this, but then you're asking me for that. And so there's

876
00:57:53,925 --> 00:57:57,085
Speaker 22:  this sort of mismatch and perhaps

877
00:57:57,965 --> 00:58:01,885
Speaker 22:  a feeling that there is perhaps some kind of bait and switch going on or

878
00:58:01,885 --> 00:58:05,565
Speaker 22:  something like that in addition to just the extraordinarily large numbers

879
00:58:06,035 --> 00:58:09,605
Speaker 22:  because these big numbers are statutory

880
00:58:09,605 --> 00:58:13,485
Speaker 22:  damages. But the problem is, is there's a really big

881
00:58:14,285 --> 00:58:18,245
Speaker 22:  mismatch between actual harm being done and the damages being

882
00:58:18,275 --> 00:58:21,725
Speaker 22:  awarded, which is bad on a couple of levels, right? First it just

883
00:58:22,215 --> 00:58:26,085
Speaker 22:  seems really unfair. And that's a problem beyond just for

884
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:29,685
Speaker 22:  the parties involved because I think it makes our courts look bad,

885
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:34,045
Speaker 22:  right? Our judiciary and our legal system depends,

886
00:58:34,105 --> 00:58:38,005
Speaker 22:  at least in part, on being trusted and respected. And when

887
00:58:38,005 --> 00:58:41,325
Speaker 22:  you go around saying that someone's gotta pay half a million dollars because

888
00:58:41,325 --> 00:58:45,285
Speaker 22:  they sold one $5 widget, that isn't a great

889
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:49,005
Speaker 22:  look for the court system, let alone for just larger, more pure ideas

890
00:58:49,065 --> 00:58:52,805
Speaker 22:  of justice. And so I think that's why cases like the Luke Combs case,

891
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:56,005
Speaker 22:  why the, like the Curtis case, the grumpy Cat T catch a lot of people's

892
00:58:56,005 --> 00:58:59,845
Speaker 22:  attention because it just seems and is fundamentally

893
00:58:59,845 --> 00:59:00,205
Speaker 22:  unfair.

894
00:59:00,965 --> 00:59:04,245
Speaker 2:  I guess we could talk about like the status of the Grumpy Cat T case.

895
00:59:05,035 --> 00:59:08,845
Speaker 22:  Yeah, the grumpy Cat T case. Actually I just checked so, so one thing when

896
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:12,005
Speaker 22:  we were talking grumpy Cat T and Schedule A is, you have to clarify which

897
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:14,645
Speaker 22:  Grumpy Cat T schedule a case, they're

898
00:59:14,645 --> 00:59:16,525
Speaker 2:  Very litigious, right? The owners,

899
00:59:17,445 --> 00:59:21,045
Speaker 22:  I did a docket search And I found over 60 cases

900
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:25,005
Speaker 22:  wow. Schedule A in the Northern district, which is a lot.

901
00:59:25,585 --> 00:59:29,125
Speaker 22:  And you know, in that one, a couple of the defendants had

902
00:59:29,385 --> 00:59:33,285
Speaker 22:  fought back, including pro se right? Without a lawyer. And

903
00:59:33,825 --> 00:59:37,285
Speaker 22:  the judge actually did end up granting

904
00:59:37,775 --> 00:59:40,885
Speaker 22:  those three defendant's motions to dismiss. Hmm.

905
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,885
Speaker 22:  So really great news for those three defendants.

906
00:59:44,155 --> 00:59:44,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

907
00:59:44,985 --> 00:59:48,805
Speaker 22:  Not so great news for all of the other defendants who were faced with

908
00:59:48,995 --> 00:59:52,925
Speaker 22:  identical allegations that the judge said, that's not good enough

909
00:59:52,925 --> 00:59:56,725
Speaker 22:  to be sued in my court. But because they didn't fight back, I

910
00:59:56,725 --> 00:59:59,205
Speaker 22:  assume there's gonna be default judgments entered against them if there

911
00:59:59,205 --> 00:59:59,645
Speaker 22:  aren't already.

912
00:59:59,995 --> 01:00:00,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

913
01:00:01,025 --> 01:00:04,605
Speaker 22:  And that's just kinda extraordinary to me. I, I don't think that

914
01:00:04,795 --> 01:00:07,445
Speaker 22:  once the judges decided that's insufficient as a matter of law, I don't

915
01:00:07,445 --> 01:00:10,845
Speaker 22:  think has to accept it. And that's added on top of the fact that like you

916
01:00:10,845 --> 01:00:14,645
Speaker 22:  alluded to before, the merits in that case were not particularly

917
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:19,405
Speaker 22:  the strongest. So in that exact one, the Curtis one that you

918
01:00:19,405 --> 01:00:23,005
Speaker 22:  mentioned, you know, they have this word mark, they've registered the word

919
01:00:23,225 --> 01:00:26,805
Speaker 22:  grumpy cat or the phrase grumpy cat for use in connection with various products.

920
01:00:27,345 --> 01:00:31,165
Speaker 22:  And If you look at their filings, they say that exactly

921
01:00:31,165 --> 01:00:34,845
Speaker 22:  what she did wrong was call it a grumpy cat pattern in the

922
01:00:34,845 --> 01:00:38,315
Speaker 22:  description of the product. So I've got this fabric or shirt that looks

923
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:39,555
Speaker 22:  like a cat who is grumpy.

924
01:00:42,175 --> 01:00:45,395
Speaker 22:  That's not the kind of thing that trademark laws was stop you from doing

925
01:00:45,485 --> 01:00:48,235
Speaker 22:  right? You're allowed to call a grumpy cat. Grumpy cat, as long as you're

926
01:00:48,235 --> 01:00:50,875
Speaker 22:  noting it in a way that makes people think that that was made, sponsored,

927
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:54,115
Speaker 22:  or approved by the Grumpy Cat company, which

928
01:00:54,895 --> 01:00:56,355
Speaker 22:  I'm always surprised was a real thing.

929
01:00:56,945 --> 01:01:00,915
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Also, I should say that the real grumpy cat, his name, his, I'm not

930
01:01:00,915 --> 01:01:04,675
Speaker 2:  sure if it was a he or she tartar sauce died several years ago,

931
01:01:04,825 --> 01:01:08,715
Speaker 2:  like RIP tartar sauce. But grumpy Cat T is, you know, for all

932
01:01:08,715 --> 01:01:10,155
Speaker 2:  intents and purposes, not really a thing anymore.

933
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:15,035
Speaker 22:  Yeah. So we had this meme that became monetized by a company

934
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:19,355
Speaker 22:  and now like you said, the cat has passed on and the trademark

935
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:23,115
Speaker 22:  remains. So, I mean, lots of questions there, but

936
01:01:23,115 --> 01:01:26,515
Speaker 22:  again, only the three defendants who showed up got relief. And

937
01:01:26,735 --> 01:01:27,755
Speaker 22:  that's unfortunate.

938
01:01:28,305 --> 01:01:31,875
Speaker 2:  Most people probably aren't familiar with Schedule A cases and

939
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:35,235
Speaker 2:  certainly a lot of the people who are actually being sued aren't. But

940
01:01:35,705 --> 01:01:39,515
Speaker 2:  there's one group of people that is very familiar with Schedule A cases people

941
01:01:39,515 --> 01:01:42,915
Speaker 2:  practicing in the northern district of Illinois. I have a couple numbers

942
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:47,075
Speaker 2:  from Eric Goldman at the Santa Clara University School of Law.

943
01:01:47,855 --> 01:01:50,995
Speaker 2:  So he counted 7,700 cases,

944
01:01:51,605 --> 01:01:55,075
Speaker 2:  40% of which were filed after January 1st, 2024,

945
01:01:55,655 --> 01:01:59,515
Speaker 2:  naming 1.5 million defendants. And by

946
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:03,155
Speaker 2:  his count, 88% were filed in the northern district of Illinois.

947
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:07,195
Speaker 2:  And it's kind of become an epicenter of these kinds of cases. What is

948
01:02:07,195 --> 01:02:10,115
Speaker 2:  going on in the northern district of Illinois? What's happening in Chicago?

949
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:13,995
Speaker 22:  Well, I mean that's the billion dollar question, right? And I don't think

950
01:02:13,995 --> 01:02:17,955
Speaker 22:  anyone really has one single answer.

951
01:02:18,675 --> 01:02:22,405
Speaker 22:  I think, think we're seeing a lot of cases here because the judges

952
01:02:23,585 --> 01:02:27,325
Speaker 22:  let them happen here. So what do I mean by that? The schedule A

953
01:02:27,335 --> 01:02:30,725
Speaker 22:  model depends on convincing judges to

954
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:34,845
Speaker 22:  exercise their discretion at various key parts of a case

955
01:02:35,345 --> 01:02:39,205
Speaker 22:  in very specific ways. You have to be able to convince the

956
01:02:39,205 --> 01:02:43,165
Speaker 22:  judges to exercise their discretion to, for example, let you

957
01:02:43,165 --> 01:02:46,805
Speaker 22:  freeze the assets. You have to convince them to use their

958
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:50,565
Speaker 22:  discretion to let you serve the defendants by email, which is another

959
01:02:50,585 --> 01:02:54,205
Speaker 22:  key part of this. You have to convince them to use their discretion to join

960
01:02:54,285 --> 01:02:56,805
Speaker 22:  a whole bunch of defendants together to sue a whole bunch of people together.

961
01:02:57,545 --> 01:03:01,445
Speaker 22:  And it varies other points, it's all about convincing judges to

962
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:05,365
Speaker 22:  use their discretion. And so as a very practical matter, they're

963
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:09,285
Speaker 22:  filing cases here because the cases work here. Hmm. And why exactly do the

964
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,645
Speaker 22:  cases work here is the harder question?

965
01:03:11,315 --> 01:03:14,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah. If one piece of that breaks,

966
01:03:15,515 --> 01:03:19,485
Speaker 2:  does schedule a kind of fall apart or can they try to figure out ways

967
01:03:19,485 --> 01:03:19,925
Speaker 2:  around that?

968
01:03:20,635 --> 01:03:23,925
Speaker 22:  Well, that's a great question and we're starting to see some natural

969
01:03:24,075 --> 01:03:27,165
Speaker 22:  experiments to some degree on that. So

970
01:03:27,795 --> 01:03:31,525
Speaker 22:  it's hard, right? So the northern district is actually a pretty big

971
01:03:31,525 --> 01:03:34,885
Speaker 22:  federal bench. There's a lot of judges compared to certain districts.

972
01:03:35,505 --> 01:03:38,965
Speaker 22:  So even If you've got two or three or five who are skeptical,

973
01:03:39,475 --> 01:03:43,365
Speaker 22:  there's still like 20 who are totally okay with this, right? The question

974
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:47,165
Speaker 22:  is then how do you respond? And we've seen defendants

975
01:03:47,165 --> 01:03:51,045
Speaker 22:  respond in different ways. Sometimes we've seen them dismiss

976
01:03:51,045 --> 01:03:54,685
Speaker 22:  their cases and refile and hope to get a new judge in the same

977
01:03:54,925 --> 01:03:58,485
Speaker 22:  district. And we know this because other judges have noticed and called

978
01:03:58,485 --> 01:04:02,125
Speaker 22:  them out for that. Judge Therp has done this quite a bit

979
01:04:02,435 --> 01:04:05,925
Speaker 22:  here in the northern district. We have seen cases where

980
01:04:06,515 --> 01:04:10,045
Speaker 22:  they go and they file in a completely different district, right? Fine, you

981
01:04:10,285 --> 01:04:14,205
Speaker 22:  don't like my, my joinder judge, I'm gonna go file in Pittsburgh. And

982
01:04:14,755 --> 01:04:18,645
Speaker 22:  this is interesting because the idea of

983
01:04:18,645 --> 01:04:22,605
Speaker 22:  forum shopping to a certain degree is totally tolerated

984
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:26,165
Speaker 22:  and okay under the law, right? If I have a case that under the, the

985
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:29,925
Speaker 22:  relevant rules could equally be filed in Chicago and Pittsburgh,

986
01:04:30,405 --> 01:04:33,005
Speaker 22:  normally I, as the plaintiff get to choose, there's not anything inherently

987
01:04:33,005 --> 01:04:36,805
Speaker 22:  wrong with that. Where it starts to get messy is like this

988
01:04:36,805 --> 01:04:40,765
Speaker 22:  case we recently saw where plaintiffs

989
01:04:40,765 --> 01:04:44,405
Speaker 22:  filed their case in Chicago get a judge. They don't like dismiss the case

990
01:04:44,405 --> 01:04:47,605
Speaker 22:  and refile against the same defendants and maybe other people somewhere

991
01:04:47,605 --> 01:04:51,245
Speaker 22:  else. Hmm. I've seen a fair number in Atlanta recently.

992
01:04:51,515 --> 01:04:55,205
Speaker 22:  Nike for some reason, likes to file in Atlanta. Hmm. As far as I can tell,

993
01:04:55,565 --> 01:04:59,205
Speaker 22:  we've seen a number in Pittsburgh. We, I just saw one in

994
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:02,605
Speaker 22:  Kansas. Huh? That was the first one I saw.

995
01:05:03,085 --> 01:05:06,845
Speaker 22:  It's about salt and pepper shakers and the Yeah, the judge just

996
01:05:06,845 --> 01:05:07,805
Speaker 22:  granted the TRO.

997
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:12,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. One thing that really drew me to schedule A cases

998
01:05:12,345 --> 01:05:16,325
Speaker 2:  and really fascinated me was that it kind of flips the script

999
01:05:16,525 --> 01:05:20,325
Speaker 2:  a little bit. And we think of infringement and counterfeiting obviously as

1000
01:05:20,605 --> 01:05:24,365
Speaker 2:  problems that exist online. We understand that rights holders

1001
01:05:24,595 --> 01:05:28,445
Speaker 2:  want to protect what they've created and even alleged

1002
01:05:28,445 --> 01:05:31,845
Speaker 2:  infringers, alleged counterfeiters, they do deserve due process, right? They

1003
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,885
Speaker 2:  should have their day in court, they should have the opportunity to respond

1004
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:38,965
Speaker 2:  to allegations because sometimes they didn't really infringe at all. So

1005
01:05:39,355 --> 01:05:43,085
Speaker 2:  what is the danger of sort of allowing schedule asus to proceed at the current

1006
01:05:43,155 --> 01:05:47,005
Speaker 2:  clip to proceed sort of how they're, they're working right now.

1007
01:05:47,615 --> 01:05:50,525
Speaker 22:  There are a lot of reasons to be concerned as a really

1008
01:05:51,075 --> 01:05:54,725
Speaker 22:  practical matter, right? We talked about how

1009
01:05:54,725 --> 01:05:57,925
Speaker 22:  individual defendants can be wrongfully caught up in these

1010
01:05:58,205 --> 01:06:01,645
Speaker 22:  dragnets. Now, I'm not totally sure how

1011
01:06:02,195 --> 01:06:06,125
Speaker 22:  different plaintiff's firms come up with these cases or who's vetting their

1012
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:10,085
Speaker 22:  claims. And we can't know for sure what percentage of

1013
01:06:10,085 --> 01:06:13,965
Speaker 22:  these infringement claims have merit and which ones don't. But we

1014
01:06:13,965 --> 01:06:16,965
Speaker 22:  do know for sure that an alarming number of them

1015
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:20,885
Speaker 22:  completely lack merit. And that's not something I say lightly.

1016
01:06:21,605 --> 01:06:25,045
Speaker 22:  I think as someone who is a, you know, a due process absolutist, a proceduralist,

1017
01:06:25,365 --> 01:06:27,605
Speaker 22:  I would be concerned, even if these were all perfect infringement, right?

1018
01:06:27,605 --> 01:06:30,685
Speaker 22:  They actually had merits, and you're actually an infringer, I would self

1019
01:06:30,685 --> 01:06:33,285
Speaker 22:  concerned about this litigation model just from a due process procedure

1020
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:37,005
Speaker 22:  perspective. But when you add in the fact that a lot of these defendants

1021
01:06:37,105 --> 01:06:40,645
Speaker 22:  are very, very clearly not infringers, let alone counterfeiters.

1022
01:06:40,985 --> 01:06:44,365
Speaker 22:  And again, I can't quantify that as a percentage because of just the volume

1023
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:47,205
Speaker 22:  plus the secrecy plus all these other problems we've talked about.

1024
01:06:48,385 --> 01:06:52,155
Speaker 22:  But I've seen enough to be very, very, very disturbed. And

1025
01:06:52,485 --> 01:06:55,355
Speaker 22:  again, this is a problem not only for the individual defendants, but also

1026
01:06:55,355 --> 01:06:59,115
Speaker 22:  for the integrity of the system. Right? What does this say about design

1027
01:06:59,145 --> 01:07:02,995
Speaker 22:  patents in particular, right? You know, that's my thing. In design patents,

1028
01:07:02,995 --> 01:07:06,435
Speaker 22:  it's maybe particularly concerning because you can get a design patent

1029
01:07:06,895 --> 01:07:10,835
Speaker 22:  really easily and really quickly for not

1030
01:07:10,835 --> 01:07:14,375
Speaker 22:  enough lot of money in the scheme of things. And so we've seen

1031
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:18,255
Speaker 22:  allegations of people saying that this plaintiff went and got a design

1032
01:07:18,255 --> 01:07:21,135
Speaker 22:  patent on something that already exists on an Amazon that they didn't create,

1033
01:07:21,475 --> 01:07:24,975
Speaker 22:  and then they sued all all of us in a scheduled case. And

1034
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:30,015
Speaker 22:  if that's true, that's incredibly disturbing, right? And the

1035
01:07:30,015 --> 01:07:33,455
Speaker 22:  part that is additionally disturbing to me is that it's plausible

1036
01:07:33,955 --> 01:07:37,735
Speaker 22:  design patent examiners at the PTO are really hardworking

1037
01:07:37,735 --> 01:07:41,175
Speaker 22:  people. Everyone I've met is really dedicated and smart and doing the best

1038
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:44,935
Speaker 22:  they can, but they only get a couple of hours. You can't search all of Amazon

1039
01:07:45,075 --> 01:07:47,855
Speaker 22:  in the couple of hours, let alone do all the other work you need to do on

1040
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:51,815
Speaker 22:  your file. And so we have a system where In theory, even If you have a design

1041
01:07:51,815 --> 01:07:55,575
Speaker 22:  patent, if the applicants are not being

1042
01:07:56,215 --> 01:08:00,195
Speaker 22:  scrupulous, there is room for additional exploitation, which again,

1043
01:08:00,305 --> 01:08:04,075
Speaker 22:  puts the entire system into disrepute. Not to mention being

1044
01:08:04,275 --> 01:08:07,235
Speaker 22:  enormously unfair to all the people who were being targeting. And then there's

1045
01:08:07,235 --> 01:08:11,195
Speaker 22:  the public, right? Let's say that I wanted to buy a purse hook,

1046
01:08:12,215 --> 01:08:15,765
Speaker 22:  but the best one out there was taken off the market because they got threatened

1047
01:08:15,765 --> 01:08:19,325
Speaker 22:  by a schedule a plaintiff, even though they didn't infringe. There's a harm

1048
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:23,085
Speaker 22:  to competition in consumers because while online infringement

1049
01:08:23,145 --> 01:08:26,325
Speaker 22:  is a problem, online choice is a good,

1050
01:08:26,995 --> 01:08:30,545
Speaker 22:  right? And so I think there's a lot of people who get hurt here in a very

1051
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:34,705
Speaker 22:  practical way. In addition to all these sort of more

1052
01:08:34,955 --> 01:08:38,825
Speaker 22:  maybe abstract sounding concerns about due process or procedure

1053
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,945
Speaker 22:  or you know, law,

1054
01:08:42,845 --> 01:08:46,065
Speaker 2:  Is there any indication that judges are beginning to question this tactic?

1055
01:08:46,105 --> 01:08:49,385
Speaker 2:  I know there was an order coming down from a judge in the Northern District

1056
01:08:49,385 --> 01:08:51,025
Speaker 2:  of Illinois. Walk me through what he said.

1057
01:08:52,285 --> 01:08:56,225
Speaker 22:  So Judge Ness. So it looks like starting in about

1058
01:08:56,475 --> 01:08:59,705
Speaker 22:  March, judge Ness started

1059
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:04,315
Speaker 22:  issuing these orders in all his Schedule A cases where

1060
01:09:04,335 --> 01:09:07,995
Speaker 22:  he said, look, I become concerned about this litigation

1061
01:09:08,045 --> 01:09:12,035
Speaker 22:  model and especially these certain parts where I'm being asked to use my

1062
01:09:12,035 --> 01:09:15,885
Speaker 22:  discretion in these certain ways. So I'm gonna hold all these cases in

1063
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:19,645
Speaker 22:  abeyance for now while I figure it out, which is completely my,

1064
01:09:19,675 --> 01:09:22,285
Speaker 22:  I've never heard of a judge doing anything like this. Like this is wild,

1065
01:09:22,795 --> 01:09:25,205
Speaker 22:  just saying, we gotta shut this all down so we can figure out what's going

1066
01:09:25,205 --> 01:09:29,165
Speaker 22:  on, right? Judicial version and yeah, this is pretty

1067
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,765
Speaker 22:  extraordinary. And that's added to a rising

1068
01:09:33,305 --> 01:09:37,205
Speaker 22:  number of cases where we've seen other judges on issues like

1069
01:09:37,355 --> 01:09:41,245
Speaker 22:  joinder say, Hey look, I know that other judges have accepted this, but

1070
01:09:41,325 --> 01:09:45,125
Speaker 22:  I don't, here's why. There was a case filed by Toyota where Judge

1071
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:48,765
Speaker 22:  Daniel issued his decision. It's become very persuasive. I see that

1072
01:09:48,775 --> 01:09:51,845
Speaker 22:  cited by other judges. Even judges will say, Hey look, I used to do this,

1073
01:09:51,845 --> 01:09:55,085
Speaker 22:  but this has changed my mind. Hmm. We've seen

1074
01:09:55,665 --> 01:09:59,445
Speaker 22:  judges with those asset freezes. There's a case Judge

1075
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:03,485
Speaker 22:  Seger issued involving the character Zoro. I love these cites. They're

1076
01:10:03,485 --> 01:10:07,165
Speaker 22:  all the most amazing. So in the Zorro case, he kind of

1077
01:10:07,405 --> 01:10:11,245
Speaker 22:  identified that sort of turnabout game that plaintiffs were playing with

1078
01:10:11,245 --> 01:10:13,605
Speaker 22:  the asset freezes where they say, I'm asking for this, but then I'm gonna

1079
01:10:13,605 --> 01:10:15,925
Speaker 22:  get that at the end of the case. And he said, I'm not freezing it, I'm not

1080
01:10:15,925 --> 01:10:19,085
Speaker 22:  doing it. I don't believe you anymore. Which again, is pretty extraordinary

1081
01:10:19,425 --> 01:10:22,365
Speaker 22:  for a federal judge to just be like, I don't believe you anymore. And we

1082
01:10:22,365 --> 01:10:26,245
Speaker 22:  have seen at least one judge start citing that Zoro case more frequently.

1083
01:10:26,565 --> 01:10:29,205
Speaker 22:  I believe that the plaintiff's lawyers have been fighting back. I'm not

1084
01:10:29,205 --> 01:10:33,165
Speaker 22:  sure exactly how successful they've been. So it does seem like

1085
01:10:33,165 --> 01:10:36,125
Speaker 22:  there again, and this is just in the northern district, that there has been

1086
01:10:36,955 --> 01:10:38,965
Speaker 22:  some pushback from newer judges,

1087
01:13:26,885 --> 01:13:30,665
Speaker 2:  and the email is vergecast at The Verge dot com. We love all your

1088
01:13:30,785 --> 01:13:33,985
Speaker 2:  questions and we try to answer at least one on the show every week. So keep

1089
01:13:34,145 --> 01:13:38,065
Speaker 2:  'em coming. And today I have Victoria song to help me answer a fun one about

1090
01:13:38,285 --> 01:13:39,305
Speaker 2:  AI translator apps.

1091
01:13:41,595 --> 01:13:45,415
Speaker 25:  Hey y'all, longtime listener, first time caller. My

1092
01:13:45,415 --> 01:13:48,815
Speaker 25:  name's tj. I'm an American currently living between Mexico and Columbia

1093
01:13:48,965 --> 01:13:52,935
Speaker 25:  because of my relationship. Shout out to love and Immigration law.

1094
01:13:53,435 --> 01:13:57,335
Speaker 25:  So here's my question slash rant slash cry

1095
01:13:57,335 --> 01:14:01,215
Speaker 25:  for health. I am a huge user and fan of ai, both

1096
01:14:01,355 --> 01:14:05,255
Speaker 25:  in my personal life and professionally, but I still don't

1097
01:14:05,255 --> 01:14:08,615
Speaker 25:  have a good real time natural feeling translation tool.

1098
01:14:09,395 --> 01:14:12,285
Speaker 25:  My partner's mom And I spend a lot of time together and she doesn't speak

1099
01:14:12,285 --> 01:14:16,045
Speaker 25:  English, so I've been relying on chat GPT voice mode, which is

1100
01:14:16,275 --> 01:14:20,165
Speaker 25:  genuinely amazing. But Google Translate and Apple

1101
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:23,965
Speaker 25:  translates still feel like robot interns and voice mode, advanced

1102
01:14:23,965 --> 01:14:26,925
Speaker 25:  voice mode is pretty limited for like everyday use.

1103
01:14:28,065 --> 01:14:31,885
Speaker 25:  So I want something that can do live back and forth, translation reliably,

1104
01:14:32,075 --> 01:14:35,285
Speaker 25:  like subtitle, a real conversation, let us actually talk.

1105
01:14:35,835 --> 01:14:39,405
Speaker 25:  I've been searching everywhere and I'm almost ready to drop $500 on meta

1106
01:14:39,515 --> 01:14:43,205
Speaker 25:  raybans just for the translation feature. But like, do I trust

1107
01:14:43,355 --> 01:14:46,605
Speaker 25:  LAMA to handle emotional nuance with this Colombian mom? I do not.

1108
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:51,365
Speaker 25:  So my question is, is there anything out there I'm missing? Are there tools

1109
01:14:51,365 --> 01:14:55,285
Speaker 25:  worth trying? Are we or are we still in the almost but

1110
01:14:55,285 --> 01:14:59,165
Speaker 25:  not quite territory for live AI translation? I

1111
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:01,885
Speaker 25:  would love your take honestly. Thanks all. Love your pod.

1112
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:06,495
Speaker 2:  Okay. I was thinking about this V And I think we both speak Japanese, so

1113
01:15:06,495 --> 01:15:10,135
Speaker 2:  maybe we should just do it in Japanese and have everyone AI translate. Oh

1114
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:11,255
Speaker 2:  my god, just kidding.

1115
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:22,415
Speaker 2:  Anyway, so this is a good duo to tackle this. I

1116
01:15:22,825 --> 01:15:26,455
Speaker 2:  personally think, I mean I just have a hard time with any

1117
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:29,535
Speaker 2:  translator things because language is so dynamic. Yes. That it changes

1118
01:15:30,515 --> 01:15:34,295
Speaker 2:  day to day, week to week, month to month. And like I have

1119
01:15:34,325 --> 01:15:38,295
Speaker 2:  used translator tools for my entire life for various reasons. And

1120
01:15:38,295 --> 01:15:42,055
Speaker 2:  like it has never gotten to the point where it can keep up with

1121
01:15:42,715 --> 01:15:46,135
Speaker 2:  the way that people speak casually. Naturally. Yeah, yeah.

1122
01:15:46,385 --> 01:15:47,815
Speaker 2:  Slang. Like just forget about it.

1123
01:15:48,005 --> 01:15:51,775
Speaker 26:  Yeah. And I have used a lot of translation tech just because

1124
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:55,535
Speaker 26:  like I like my Japanese pretty decent, my Korean

1125
01:15:56,475 --> 01:15:59,615
Speaker 26:  not great. Even though those two languages are quite similar, like almost

1126
01:16:00,015 --> 01:16:03,935
Speaker 26:  grammatically, not almost, they are grammatically identical. And

1127
01:16:04,055 --> 01:16:07,895
Speaker 26:  a lot of the vocabulary is the same. It's just I'm not great at

1128
01:16:08,215 --> 01:16:12,135
Speaker 26:  speaking it, understanding it. I'm Korean Chewbacca in my family just because

1129
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:15,735
Speaker 26:  I speak English, they speak Korean and we understand each other just fine.

1130
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:19,695
Speaker 26:  So to that point, there are times where I have wanted these

1131
01:16:19,695 --> 01:16:23,455
Speaker 26:  kinds of tools and so I've tested a bunch of them with my family

1132
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:27,535
Speaker 26:  and I regret to tell you listener, tj,

1133
01:16:28,605 --> 01:16:32,375
Speaker 26:  they're not you, you are coming up against what all of them

1134
01:16:32,695 --> 01:16:33,575
Speaker 26:  struggle with. Like

1135
01:16:35,885 --> 01:16:39,495
Speaker 26:  they just can't handle slang. Yeah. And if Colombian mothers

1136
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:43,655
Speaker 26:  or anything like Korean mothers Yeah. And auntie figures, they

1137
01:16:43,655 --> 01:16:44,975
Speaker 26:  do be talking at the speed of light.

1138
01:16:45,085 --> 01:16:48,975
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And like the precision is so important. Yeah. When you're

1139
01:16:48,975 --> 01:16:52,775
Speaker 2:  talking across languages and across cultures and like

1140
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:56,735
Speaker 2:  one thing that I've always found very difficult is, so like

1141
01:16:56,775 --> 01:17:00,495
Speaker 2:  I grew up in Japan And I haven't

1142
01:17:00,525 --> 01:17:04,135
Speaker 2:  been like living full-time in Japan in a really long time.

1143
01:17:04,435 --> 01:17:08,255
Speaker 2:  And so a lot of like my vocabulary in Japanese is almost like

1144
01:17:08,265 --> 01:17:11,965
Speaker 2:  stuck in time with the slang or the way that people spoke at the time

1145
01:17:12,165 --> 01:17:16,045
Speaker 2:  I last lived there. And that is something that I think no

1146
01:17:16,055 --> 01:17:19,925
Speaker 2:  translator app ai or not could ever help me with like that. You

1147
01:17:19,925 --> 01:17:23,805
Speaker 2:  need to be actively speaking and engaging with people in

1148
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:27,645
Speaker 2:  this moment to really pick up on the nuance like TJ was

1149
01:17:27,645 --> 01:17:28,125
Speaker 2:  asking about.

1150
01:17:28,555 --> 01:17:32,485
Speaker 26:  Yeah. There's like so many examples of that. Like my family immigrated from

1151
01:17:32,535 --> 01:17:36,245
Speaker 26:  Korea to the US a long ass time, like over 50 years ago at this point.

1152
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:40,485
Speaker 26:  And one thing that I learned growing up with the word for bathroom we called

1153
01:17:40,485 --> 01:17:43,645
Speaker 26:  it, which is apparently like ancient colonial times,

1154
01:17:44,335 --> 01:17:48,245
Speaker 26:  still living under Japan Wow. Levels for the word

1155
01:17:48,605 --> 01:17:52,245
Speaker 26:  bathroom. Yeah. And I was just like, oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. And that

1156
01:17:52,245 --> 01:17:55,085
Speaker 26:  explains why when I went back to visit family And I was like, oh,

1157
01:17:57,915 --> 01:18:00,645
Speaker 26:  they were like, do you mean which is the actual

1158
01:18:00,825 --> 01:18:01,965
Speaker 2:  Oh, interesting. Like

1159
01:18:01,965 --> 01:18:05,685
Speaker 26:  The actual word for it. So you know is, is a

1160
01:18:05,685 --> 01:18:08,885
Speaker 26:  translator gonna be able to handle skippity toilet? That's my, that's my

1161
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:09,925
Speaker 26:  example that I use all

1162
01:18:09,925 --> 01:18:11,365
Speaker 2:  The time. That's a litmus test. That's a

1163
01:18:11,365 --> 01:18:15,245
Speaker 26:  Litmus test because those are the things, and I remember when I

1164
01:18:15,245 --> 01:18:18,365
Speaker 26:  was in high school and taking Japanese, my Japanese teacher was losing her

1165
01:18:18,365 --> 01:18:21,605
Speaker 26:  mind because of the slang that the Japanese kids were using, which was

1166
01:18:22,195 --> 01:18:25,125
Speaker 26:  kuru because she's like, that means to turn. Mm.

1167
01:18:25,775 --> 01:18:26,125
Speaker 2:  Right,

1168
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:29,325
Speaker 26:  Right. And and apparently no, it meant teens were saying we're going to

1169
01:18:29,525 --> 01:18:29,965
Speaker 26:  McDonald's.

1170
01:18:30,195 --> 01:18:32,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's so interesting. So

1171
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:33,685
Speaker 26:  It's, it's, it's like these things where

1172
01:18:36,435 --> 01:18:40,365
Speaker 2:  It's really hard. But I do think TJ, that you maybe are in

1173
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:44,325
Speaker 2:  the perfect situation in real life to get

1174
01:18:44,325 --> 01:18:48,165
Speaker 2:  over some of these shortcomings with like the tech

1175
01:18:48,305 --> 01:18:52,205
Speaker 2:  option. Like in my opinion, when you are trying to speak with, you

1176
01:18:52,205 --> 01:18:56,085
Speaker 2:  know, your partner's family, like that's a great time to

1177
01:18:56,225 --> 01:19:00,165
Speaker 2:  ask about the nuance. I assume that you probably have some language capabilities,

1178
01:19:00,705 --> 01:19:04,605
Speaker 2:  but you know, maybe you use that opportunity to be like, you said

1179
01:19:04,605 --> 01:19:08,325
Speaker 2:  this word and I'm not quite following. Like can you help me understand what

1180
01:19:08,325 --> 01:19:11,725
Speaker 2:  it means? I actually had a great time doing this with some friends from Japan

1181
01:19:11,745 --> 01:19:14,765
Speaker 2:  who were visiting the last couple years. Like they would teach me all of

1182
01:19:14,765 --> 01:19:18,125
Speaker 2:  the new things that the kids were saying, like even younger than we are.

1183
01:19:18,805 --> 01:19:22,325
Speaker 2:  And they're like, I don't really know where it comes from, but this is what

1184
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:25,045
Speaker 2:  the kids are saying. Like the tech is never gonna keep up with that. No.

1185
01:19:25,465 --> 01:19:29,445
Speaker 2:  But If you have people around you who can explain that context and explain

1186
01:19:29,445 --> 01:19:32,445
Speaker 2:  the meaning, like that's golden. That's a great opportunity.

1187
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:36,165
Speaker 26:  Also, If you are living between Mexico and Columbia, that's like a great

1188
01:19:36,385 --> 01:19:40,365
Speaker 26:  chance to be immersed in that and you can use the tech to kind of

1189
01:19:40,365 --> 01:19:43,925
Speaker 26:  help you learn certain things while you're getting up to speed.

1190
01:19:44,365 --> 01:19:48,245
Speaker 26:  I think at the level where the tech is now, it's very friendly

1191
01:19:48,465 --> 01:19:52,085
Speaker 26:  for people who are tourists. It's not really useful in family situations.

1192
01:19:52,085 --> 01:19:55,845
Speaker 26:  It's not necessarily useful in any situation other than, I

1193
01:19:55,845 --> 01:19:59,285
Speaker 26:  dunno how to read a menu. Yeah. But you kind of can't just

1194
01:19:59,555 --> 01:20:03,245
Speaker 26:  scan it to read a menu and then not learn what the words are

1195
01:20:03,245 --> 01:20:06,325
Speaker 26:  because y you know, I've used the translation feature

1196
01:20:07,265 --> 01:20:11,085
Speaker 26:  for Spanish actually on the meta ray bands and it

1197
01:20:11,085 --> 01:20:14,365
Speaker 26:  couldn't handle slang. One, it couldn't handle slang. And then

1198
01:20:14,905 --> 01:20:18,125
Speaker 26:  If you, we were, I was speaking with someone who was fluent in Spanish and

1199
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:21,245
Speaker 26:  English and if we were switching back because it was just easier for them

1200
01:20:21,245 --> 01:20:24,965
Speaker 26:  to explain something in English. I had John Cena's voice because

1201
01:20:25,065 --> 01:20:28,445
Speaker 26:  you can, you can make the meta AI sound like John Cena and why not Life

1202
01:20:28,445 --> 01:20:28,805
Speaker 26:  is short.

1203
01:20:28,805 --> 01:20:30,005
Speaker 2:  That seems distracting, have

1204
01:20:30,005 --> 01:20:33,565
Speaker 26:  Fun. You do hear them in your ear at the same time and you're having that

1205
01:20:33,565 --> 01:20:34,485
Speaker 26:  problem. So

1206
01:20:36,045 --> 01:20:39,965
Speaker 26:  I think it's okay in a pinch if you're going around town and you just really

1207
01:20:39,995 --> 01:20:43,645
Speaker 26:  need help for, I don't know how much this costs, can you tell me how much

1208
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:46,765
Speaker 26:  this costs? Like those things the translation can handle

1209
01:20:47,495 --> 01:20:51,405
Speaker 26:  every day, like bonding and getting to know someone. These

1210
01:20:51,405 --> 01:20:55,085
Speaker 26:  things can't really do it. And If you use it as a crutch, I think you're

1211
01:20:55,765 --> 01:20:59,525
Speaker 26:  arguably missing out on connecting with your partner's mother. So I

1212
01:20:59,525 --> 01:21:03,485
Speaker 2:  Think a lot of people who are speaking with a non-native speaker actually

1213
01:21:03,515 --> 01:21:07,325
Speaker 2:  love explaining Yeah. Words. Another thing I was just thinking about

1214
01:21:07,325 --> 01:21:11,245
Speaker 2:  here is like, there is a lot in Japan and Japanese that is

1215
01:21:11,245 --> 01:21:14,685
Speaker 2:  very reference heavy. Like If you watch Japanese television, like

1216
01:21:15,075 --> 01:21:18,845
Speaker 2:  late night shows or whatever, there are so many references that like, I

1217
01:21:18,845 --> 01:21:22,765
Speaker 2:  don't, even if I had a subtitle machine, I don't even think it would be helpful.

1218
01:21:22,955 --> 01:21:26,485
Speaker 26:  Yeah. It's like I almost, you know, in college I had a, I had a

1219
01:21:26,785 --> 01:21:29,245
Speaker 26:  two second dream that I was gonna be a translator. And

1220
01:21:29,245 --> 01:21:31,765
Speaker 2:  Then same, I think that's just like, yeah, canonical

1221
01:21:32,885 --> 01:21:33,125
Speaker 26:  A thing,

1222
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:35,245
Speaker 2:  Weird idea that we have at some point,

1223
01:21:35,505 --> 01:21:38,685
Speaker 26:  For whatever reason I was like, yeah, I'm gonna be a translator. And then

1224
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:41,725
Speaker 26:  it was like, oh my god, I don't, 'cause when you have the subtitles, you

1225
01:21:41,885 --> 01:21:44,605
Speaker 26:  actually have a character limit as to what you're gonna say. Right. So you

1226
01:21:44,605 --> 01:21:48,085
Speaker 26:  were gonna lose out on all the context and the nuance there. And you know,

1227
01:21:48,725 --> 01:21:52,605
Speaker 26:  Japanese and Korean are both, I think, high context languages. So to your

1228
01:21:52,605 --> 01:21:55,765
Speaker 26:  point, everything's referential and it's about what's not being said and

1229
01:21:55,765 --> 01:21:59,445
Speaker 26:  there's no AI that's gonna be able to like, you know, if someone

1230
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:00,645
Speaker 26:  goes Mm,

1231
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:03,845
Speaker 26:  they're saying no,

1232
01:22:04,315 --> 01:22:04,605
Speaker 2:  Like

1233
01:22:04,935 --> 01:22:05,965
Speaker 26:  There there's some like,

1234
01:22:06,825 --> 01:22:08,805
Speaker 2:  You know what I mean? It's like, it's not what it means really.

1235
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:12,245
Speaker 26:  It's not, it's not what that means or it's just like, I, I think my favorite

1236
01:22:12,245 --> 01:22:15,525
Speaker 26:  video about how weird Japanese can be is like all the things that

1237
01:22:16,025 --> 01:22:17,005
Speaker 26:  dejavu can mean.

1238
01:22:18,265 --> 01:22:18,645
Speaker 2:  So true.

1239
01:22:18,955 --> 01:22:19,805
Speaker 26:  It's just like, oh

1240
01:22:21,635 --> 01:22:21,925
Speaker 26:  yeah.

1241
01:22:21,925 --> 01:22:23,165
Speaker 2:  Right, right.

1242
01:22:23,465 --> 01:22:27,045
Speaker 26:  It just like, it all means different things. Yeah. So like

1243
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:31,285
Speaker 26:  Spanish is not the same and each language has its nuances. But

1244
01:22:31,715 --> 01:22:35,205
Speaker 26:  yeah, if, If you were gonna try something, there is something called Time

1245
01:22:35,225 --> 01:22:39,125
Speaker 26:  kettle there. I, I keep, I know all of this And I keep going, well maybe

1246
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:42,725
Speaker 26:  this one will be different. So I got a pair of time kettle earbuds.

1247
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:46,085
Speaker 26:  I'll try it. We'll see. But

1248
01:22:47,415 --> 01:22:50,925
Speaker 26:  don't rob yourself the, the chance of fumbling through all the

1249
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:54,925
Speaker 26:  funny things that will happen. Yeah. Due in this translation

1250
01:22:55,035 --> 01:22:56,245
Speaker 26:  with your Colombian

1251
01:22:56,825 --> 01:23:00,005
Speaker 2:  Mom. Once you make some of these mistakes, you'll never forget it. You know

1252
01:23:00,005 --> 01:23:01,885
Speaker 2:  what I mean? You'll never forget what's right. Oh

1253
01:23:01,885 --> 01:23:05,370
Speaker 26:  God. There's so many things in language learning. Like I will never forget

1254
01:23:06,145 --> 01:23:06,365
Speaker 26:  Hmm.

1255
01:23:06,685 --> 01:23:06,885
Speaker 2:  Japanese

1256
01:23:07,265 --> 01:23:11,205
Speaker 26:  And because it was like a, an example that my very enthusiastic

1257
01:23:11,845 --> 01:23:14,805
Speaker 26:  Japanese teacher was like, how would you read this kanji to this advanced

1258
01:23:14,805 --> 01:23:18,565
Speaker 26:  group, group of Japanese leaders of readers and in college? And we were

1259
01:23:18,565 --> 01:23:22,405
Speaker 26:  like, KU beautiful person office. No,

1260
01:23:22,555 --> 01:23:26,005
Speaker 26:  it's, it's a badger game. And she's like, it's,

1261
01:23:26,805 --> 01:23:30,165
Speaker 26:  it's not read in any way. That makes sense. It's so weird. And it's a badger

1262
01:23:30,165 --> 01:23:31,405
Speaker 2:  Game. It's such a weird language.

1263
01:23:31,755 --> 01:23:35,165
Speaker 26:  It's, yeah. Yeah. Don't rob yourself of finding all the weird

1264
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:36,205
Speaker 26:  crap. Yeah.

1265
01:23:36,275 --> 01:23:37,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Agree.

1266
01:23:37,235 --> 01:23:37,525
