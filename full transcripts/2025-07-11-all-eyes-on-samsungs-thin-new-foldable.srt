17
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:44,025
Speaker 4:  as we know it. But first we've gotta talk about Samsung. Samsung was the

18
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:46,665
Speaker 4:  big thing this week. They announced a whole bunch of new phones and smart

19
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:49,305
Speaker 4:  watches. The two of you were there.

20
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:54,025
Speaker 4:  But first I just wanna, before we get into this, I wanna read what Samsung

21
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:57,625
Speaker 4:  said about Brooklyn and his press release. So, so they had their event in

22
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:01,685
Speaker 4:  Brooklyn, and this is how they described Brooklyn, the

23
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:05,525
Speaker 4:  borough in New York City. They called it quote, a borough with extraordinary

24
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:09,045
Speaker 4:  spirit and a distinctive history. Brooklyn is where

25
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:12,885
Speaker 4:  visionary thinking and bold ideas shape the future. A

26
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:15,285
Speaker 4:  place known for its culture, creativity, and collaboration.

27
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:21,645
Speaker 4:  Did you guys get that feeling? Did you feel cultural creativity and collaboration

28
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,765
Speaker 4:  at Samsung's event?

29
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:26,085
Speaker 5:  No, not really. No. No. I mostly felt angry.

30
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:30,805
Speaker 6:  Angry, hot, irritated. Yeah. So it was like

31
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:34,605
Speaker 6:  a gazillion degrees with bajillion humidity. Yeah. On Wednesday

32
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:38,405
Speaker 6:  when we went to Unpacked, so if you are

33
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:41,245
Speaker 6:  a New York City native, And I tell you that this was

34
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:46,045
Speaker 6:  hosted at a couple of warehouses in Brooklyn Navy Yard,

35
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,955
Speaker 6:  you will be groaning at this point in time. But if you're not a New York

36
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:52,955
Speaker 6:  native or you haven't been to this area of Brooklyn is the most inaccessible

37
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:56,875
Speaker 6:  area of Brooklyn by public transit. So there's just a line

38
00:03:56,895 --> 00:04:00,435
Speaker 6:  of Ubers trying to get in and very stressed out Uber drivers. Yeah.

39
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:05,115
Speaker 6:  So you know that that was, Hmm, that was something. And then

40
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:09,035
Speaker 4:  I live in Brooklyn. I do not know how to get to the Navy yard. I like, it's

41
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:10,955
Speaker 5:  Like that I design, they're not meant to

42
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:14,635
Speaker 6:  Knows, it's like a mile walk from any public transit station. So

43
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:18,355
Speaker 6:  you either are gonna make a cha make the choice of taking public transit

44
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:22,315
Speaker 6:  to this event and having to walk a mile from the closest

45
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:26,315
Speaker 6:  train station or braving the New York City bus system, which I'm

46
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,715
Speaker 6:  a lifelong New Yorker. And No,

47
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:34,355
Speaker 6:  or you're gonna take an Uber and like the vast majority of people that I

48
00:04:34,355 --> 00:04:37,275
Speaker 6:  took the, I took an Uber And I think the vast majority of people you were

49
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:38,915
Speaker 6:  stuck in, you were stuck in traffic. I was

50
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:42,515
Speaker 5:  For like, I was stuck in Brooklyn trying to get to Brooklyn because they

51
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:46,115
Speaker 5:  were doing road work outside my hotel. So I was in gridlock

52
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:49,795
Speaker 5:  for the first, it was just a mess all around. We,

53
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:52,875
Speaker 6:  We were texting like, are you there yet? Are you there? Oh my God. Like we're,

54
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:53,435
Speaker 6:  it was, it

55
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:55,675
Speaker 5:  Was like, it was just getting more and more desperate. Yeah. So

56
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,195
Speaker 4:  And so what even is this venue? Like what I

57
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:01,795
Speaker 6:  Said, Brooklyn Navy Yard is just a Navy yard. It's like a bunch of

58
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:05,915
Speaker 6:  industrial brick buildings, like shipping container type

59
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:09,475
Speaker 6:  warehouse buildings, fully metal. So

60
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,675
Speaker 6:  it was just, you know, Samsung branded. There was a lot of Unpacked flags

61
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:17,715
Speaker 6:  going in there, but it's also a maze. So you can go into the Brooklyn Navy

62
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:21,235
Speaker 6:  yard, probably have terrible signal and just be like, oh,

63
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:25,115
Speaker 6:  there's a bunch of just brick buildings with numbers attached to them

64
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:29,275
Speaker 6:  and you're just hoping the GPS is gonna get you to the right place.

65
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:32,955
Speaker 6:  And I mean, there were signs and everything and you just had to follow the,

66
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:37,955
Speaker 6:  the Korean influencers. There was a huge amount of K

67
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:41,635
Speaker 6:  Korean influencers. And I really, you know, And I was telling Allison this,

68
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:45,845
Speaker 6:  oh, 'cause you know, Samsung has a history of inviting K-pop

69
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,805
Speaker 6:  stars. So I was like, I did my makeup. I was like, there's an off chance

70
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:52,125
Speaker 6:  that a K-pop star is gonna come to this event. I love K-Pop.

71
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:56,965
Speaker 6:  We did not get K-pop stars. We got influencers that look like K-pop

72
00:05:57,045 --> 00:06:00,965
Speaker 6:  stars and the K-pop Demon hunter soundtrack just blasting. And

73
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,485
Speaker 6:  I was like, okay. I

74
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:04,005
Speaker 4:  Mean, I've heard good things. The,

75
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:07,565
Speaker 6:  The soundtrack is fire. I love the soundtrack. It was great. That put me

76
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:10,885
Speaker 6:  in a good mood. But then we were going into the, or I was going into the

77
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:14,765
Speaker 6:  main, the main green, it's called Dug Greenhouse.

78
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:18,285
Speaker 6:  This main wear metal container thing that we're going into.

79
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:22,205
Speaker 6:  And I have my hot box of water because they were being sustainable with the

80
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:26,165
Speaker 6:  water bottles and they were providing for everyone there. My hot box of water,

81
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:30,245
Speaker 6:  it was not cold at all, but I was like, I need to hydrate. This is hot, this

82
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:34,085
Speaker 6:  is humid. I'm not dressed like a Korean demon hunter, grim

83
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:37,365
Speaker 6:  reaper situation. These influencers, I'm telling you. They were, they went

84
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:38,565
Speaker 6:  all out. They went all out. Wait,

85
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:42,085
Speaker 4:  Wait, I'm sorry. The, the influencers were like in cosplay

86
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:43,405
Speaker 4:  for a phone launch

87
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:47,645
Speaker 6:  It. They were dressed to the nines. No, no. There was this one guy I pointed

88
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:50,525
Speaker 6:  him out to, to Allison And I was like, I'm happily married, but look at this

89
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:54,565
Speaker 6:  man. He had perfectly coed hair. Yeah, I'm fairly certain. He had

90
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:57,405
Speaker 6:  beautiful, he, I was like, this man has to be wearing some sort of makeup.

91
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:57,965
Speaker 5:  They were not sweating.

92
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:01,765
Speaker 6:  They were not sweating somehow. Yeah. But they were like in full like

93
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:05,765
Speaker 6:  kind of grim reaper regalia, like Korean grim

94
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:09,285
Speaker 6:  reaper regalia. There was like this one girl and she had like huge

95
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:13,685
Speaker 6:  heels on and just like this modern handbook, which is like Korean traditional

96
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:17,205
Speaker 6:  wear. And I was just like, I I, we got some cosplay in house.

97
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:18,525
Speaker 5:  I was like a sweaty

98
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,125
Speaker 6:  Puddle. Yeah, we, we were, we were there going like, oh my god, what?

99
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:22,445
Speaker 4:  So you guys did not dress up?

100
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,405
Speaker 6:  We did not dress up. We didn't wear our demon hunter costumes. We didn't

101
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:29,845
Speaker 6:  at all. I left mine at home. Yeah, yeah. Like we were not aware. But then,

102
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:33,325
Speaker 6:  you know, we're going into the venue because you tech event, you gotta run

103
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:36,725
Speaker 6:  to grab a seat. And so I'm trying to get in with my hot box of water

104
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:41,445
Speaker 6:  and the, the venue guy's like, mam, mam, mam ma'am, no water,

105
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:44,125
Speaker 6:  no beverages, no food. And I was like,

106
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:50,005
Speaker 6:  and then we get in and it's super packed full of influencers. So they had

107
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:52,805
Speaker 6:  their own line and their own badge influencers. And then there's like the

108
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,765
Speaker 6:  media section, And I don't know if you had this Allison, but there was a

109
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:58,925
Speaker 6:  guy, like there was this guy, he didn't speak any English, but he's obviously

110
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:02,565
Speaker 6:  Samsung staff and he's just like, media section here. Hmm. You can only sit

111
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:06,525
Speaker 6:  here. And there were people inside with like little media paddles. And

112
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:10,405
Speaker 6:  the one media paddle lady I talked to, she's like, if you find a seat, God

113
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:14,285
Speaker 6:  bless, just take it. And so it was a little bit of a battle

114
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:16,925
Speaker 6:  to get a seat. There were a bunch of people who didn't. So it was like super

115
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:20,005
Speaker 6:  packed. The, you know, it was a metal container so the wifi wasn't working

116
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:22,285
Speaker 6:  And I Oh my God was like, oh my god, how am I supposed to live vlog this

117
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:26,205
Speaker 6:  with, no, no. I gotta say watching Allison

118
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:30,205
Speaker 6:  though, she had the Z the previous Z fold and she was

119
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:32,325
Speaker 6:  blogging from the foldable. I did

120
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:35,325
Speaker 5:  Quick posts two WordPress from the folding

121
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:38,925
Speaker 6:  Phone. It was, this is inspiring. It was inspiring.

122
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:42,485
Speaker 4:  I feel like you broke a law of physics I to, to accomplish this.

123
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,405
Speaker 6:  Probably did. It was just like the entire time just looking at her doing

124
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:50,205
Speaker 6:  it. And I was like, oh my god. Yeah, Samsung, you don't need this

125
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:54,085
Speaker 6:  event. Just put a live stream on Allison. You know, I, this is, this

126
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:56,885
Speaker 6:  is the best ad for a foldable phone you could possibly have.

127
00:08:57,345 --> 00:09:01,325
Speaker 5:  I'd be happy to provide that service. It was, it was, I'm amazed that

128
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:04,765
Speaker 5:  it worked, but it was inspiring. Yeah. Like hotspotting our

129
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:08,565
Speaker 5:  computers, so the phones was not working for some reason V couldn't even

00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,005
Speaker 5:  airdrop a photo from her.

131
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:14,085
Speaker 6:  I couldn't, I was trying to airdrop computer. I had two phones 'cause I'm

132
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:17,485

135
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,285
Speaker 6:  this. It took like, it took 15 minutes. It was really bad.

136
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:31,285
Speaker 4:  I'm glad you discovered a use four folding phones at the folding phone event.

137
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:34,885
Speaker 4:  This, this, this is like the big question. I like they, they frigging look

138
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:37,365
Speaker 4:  awesome. Yeah. And I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing with that inside

139
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:40,845
Speaker 4:  screen. I just know I want it. Okay, so what do we see on the foldables

140
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:44,645
Speaker 5:  Front? So we got three new foldables. We have the Z fold

141
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:48,605
Speaker 5:  seven, the Z flip seven and then the Z flip

142
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:52,405
Speaker 5:  seven FE, which I continue to forget about,

143
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:56,685
Speaker 5:  but basics are Z fold seven got super

144
00:09:56,795 --> 00:10:00,245
Speaker 5:  thin. It is 8.9 millimeters thin. It's

145
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:03,605
Speaker 5:  26% thinner than the Z fold six.

146
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:07,965
Speaker 5:  It's way lighter. You just, you feel it when you pick it up. The Z flip

147
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:11,645
Speaker 5:  seven got a bigger screen on the front. That's the

148
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:15,485
Speaker 5:  clamshell style foldable. And the, the Z

149
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:18,165
Speaker 5:  flip seven FE exists

150
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:23,245
Speaker 5:  for 8 99. It's like, it's the affordable version.

151
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:26,175
Speaker 6:  We live in a world where that's affordable.

152
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:30,015
Speaker 5:  Exactly. That's my problem with it. So

153
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:34,255
Speaker 5:  big hardware changes the inner screen's like eight inches now

154
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:37,815
Speaker 5:  even more room to not know what to do with.

155
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:42,935
Speaker 5:  But we lost in that process the S pin support,

156
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:44,335
Speaker 5:  which

157
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,535
Speaker 6:  Too thin I know. So that you can't like stick

158
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:50,095
Speaker 5:  It in. Yeah, they, well they've never had a good solution for,

159
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:53,815
Speaker 5:  they were like supported the spen, but you had to buy a special spen

160
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:57,815
Speaker 5:  because a regular spen would like scratch the screen. Oh my god.

161
00:10:58,195 --> 00:11:02,095
Speaker 5:  And they've never had, like, you could buy a case that would hold the spen,

162
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:05,295
Speaker 5:  but it's not like the ultra where you can just pop it in.

163
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:10,255
Speaker 5:  So it's a little bit of like, and they're like, oh, people weren't really

164
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:14,215
Speaker 5:  using it. We could make the, the screen thinner if we didn't have that digitizer

165
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:15,895
Speaker 5:  layer. So that's what they did.

166
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:20,895
Speaker 5:  So I am a moment of silence for, you know, the spen. But

167
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:25,135
Speaker 5:  other than that it's got a 200 megapixel camera,

168
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:30,855
Speaker 5:  so it should be pretty capable. They got rid of the,

169
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:35,255
Speaker 5:  it used to have a, on the inner screen, an

170
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:37,135
Speaker 5:  under display selfie camera.

171
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:40,655
Speaker 4:  Actually I think this is so interesting, right? They got, yeah, they got

172
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:44,215
Speaker 4:  rid of the under display camera. Yeah. And now it's just a regular one. Right.

173
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:47,255
Speaker 5:  It's just a regular little hole punch. And honestly

174
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:52,135
Speaker 5:  it seems backwards, but I notice it way less with the

175
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:55,965
Speaker 5:  hole punch because that under display always had like a weird

176
00:11:56,035 --> 00:11:59,765
Speaker 5:  kind of like rainbow tearing thing that would happen when I would

177
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:03,725
Speaker 5:  glance at something at that part of the screen. And it looks to me like

178
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:07,725
Speaker 5:  the, the aura you get when you get a migraine or like an egg. So it

179
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:11,645
Speaker 5:  like freaks me out. Like that's a me problem. But this,

180
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:15,725
Speaker 4:  This feels like a good change to me because I feel like for, I don't know,

181
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:19,365
Speaker 4:  several years companies discovered under display cameras

182
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:23,685
Speaker 4:  And I, this thing always happens where the tech is kind of

183
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:27,365
Speaker 4:  bad but it looks a little bit cooler and so a bunch of companies run at it

184
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:31,165
Speaker 4:  and that felt like what was happening with under display cameras and they

185
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:35,085
Speaker 4:  were just universally like, meaningfully worse. Yeah. And

186
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:39,245
Speaker 4:  I, maybe it's just me. I don't think the whole punch cutout looks bad. Yeah,

187
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:40,245
Speaker 6:  Same. I think we're used to it.

188
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:44,485
Speaker 4:  I would so much rather have a whole punch cutout in a good camera than

189
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:48,005
Speaker 4:  like this cool slight ever so slightly cooler thing.

190
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:51,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like it's in the corner, it's not so gonna cut.

191
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:54,045
Speaker 6:  I mean it has to function first and foremost. Like I think if you're gonna

192
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:57,925
Speaker 6:  choose form over function, that's usually not the winning vet. It should

193
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:00,725
Speaker 6:  be form and function. And if you have to only pick one, it should be function.

194
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That's my, my my spiel. Yeah.

195
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:06,045
Speaker 5:  I am, I was glad to see the under display camera go.

196
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:09,405
Speaker 4:  Okay. This is, this is the first time I've picked this thing up and this

197
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,365
Speaker 4:  is incredible. This thing is,

198
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:12,685
Speaker 6:  It's so much nicer. Wild.

199
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:16,365
Speaker 5:  And I do have to do a big caveat that like

200
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:20,565
Speaker 5:  if you live in a different country that isn't the United States of America,

201
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:24,565
Speaker 5:  you have access to folding phones that are roughly

202
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:28,485
Speaker 5:  the size from like honor and oppo. So

203
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:32,405
Speaker 5:  there's a little bit of the rest of the world being like, okay, you guys

204
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:35,565
Speaker 5:  finally cut like Samsung finally caught up for you.

205
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:38,925
Speaker 4:  Well that's sort of only like a this year thing, right? Yeah,

206
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:39,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

207
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:43,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like, you know, it feels like a ma major

208
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:46,285
Speaker 4:  turn is happening in folding phones. It's sort of funny, like when this event

209
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:49,125
Speaker 4:  was coming up, I was like, oh yeah, they're doing another folding phone.

210
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:53,005
Speaker 4:  What are we on Like, like the, the Z fold three. And it's like, it is the

211
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:56,925
Speaker 4:  seventh one they've been doing these for coming up on a decade

212
00:13:57,065 --> 00:14:00,325
Speaker 4:  now. Yeah, it's wild. Which is crazy because they have like barely made a

213
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:00,765
Speaker 4:  dent

214
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:05,805
Speaker 4:  and you know, Allison, you had a story and you kind of pointed out they really

215
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:09,765
Speaker 4:  haven't changed much and this year. And I'm thinking

216
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,405
Speaker 4:  maybe even this model feels like the first time they're kind of

217
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:17,165
Speaker 4:  meaningfully changing and, and it, it's not like a, a

218
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:20,645
Speaker 4:  major form factor changes. They really just slimed down a little bit.

219
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,125
Speaker 4:  But somehow all it, this feels so

220
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,805
Speaker 6:  Different, feels so much nicer. It does in your hand. Like, 'cause you know,

221
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:29,485
Speaker 6:  I've never had a folding phone, but I've been to these events all the time

222
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:33,405
Speaker 6:  And I like play around with them. It doesn't feel heavy. It doesn't

223
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,805
Speaker 6:  feel fragile. It just feels like a phone. Yeah. Which is cool though. The

224
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:40,045
Speaker 6:  whole thing, like, I don't know if you can see it there. Like it won't sit

225
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:43,085
Speaker 6:  because of the camera bump being so ridiculous.

226
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:47,045
Speaker 6:  So that's kind of rough. That's that's rough. But

227
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:50,505
Speaker 6:  I don't know, maybe it's a good thing. 'cause you put it face down then and

228
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:52,005
Speaker 6:  then you don't look at the screen.

229
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:55,365
Speaker 5:  It does encourage me to put it face down and then I don't get Yeah. Caught

230
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:59,005
Speaker 5:  up in my phone. Yeah. I think it was a year of like, I mean like

231
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:03,445
Speaker 5:  fold four, five and six were kind of a snoozefest as far as like

232
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:07,285
Speaker 5:  they added a few millimeters here and they did this to it.

233
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:11,445
Speaker 5:  And basically the same on the, the flip phone. Like

234
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:15,845
Speaker 5:  I think maybe the four got the bigger cover

235
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:19,605
Speaker 5:  screen, but they still, you know, so the flip

236
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:23,605
Speaker 5:  the clamshell style this year got a full

237
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,565
Speaker 5:  like edge to edge screen on the front cover. And previously it sort of

238
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:31,085
Speaker 5:  like was this file folder shape that went around the cameras,

239
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:35,565
Speaker 5:  which was just sort of weird and awkward. It was like, Motorola gives us

240
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:38,965
Speaker 5:  the whole screen, we're grownups. Like, let us, let us have it.

241
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:42,965
Speaker 5:  So this did feel like a year where Samsung was like, okay,

242
00:15:43,115 --> 00:15:46,325
Speaker 5:  like here, here's the feedback we've been getting. We're gonna make these

243
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:50,685
Speaker 5:  bigger moves. And obviously, you know, like a lot

244
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:54,485
Speaker 5:  of r and d and time goes into making a phone

245
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:58,405
Speaker 5:  slim like that. I I heard that the, you know, the

246
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:02,405
Speaker 5:  edge, the Galaxy S 25 Edge really kind

247
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:06,045
Speaker 5:  of like paved the way for this. Like if wouldn't exist

248
00:16:06,395 --> 00:16:09,405
Speaker 5:  without making the the slim bar phone first.

249
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:13,525
Speaker 4:  Did people like the edge? I feel like the edge was like despised. No. Okay.

250
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:15,245
Speaker 4:  Well right, that was one with the curving sides.

251
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,405
Speaker 5:  No, no, no. Well, no,

252
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:17,205
Speaker 4:  No. There's a thin one.

253
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:21,725
Speaker 5:  Thin thin one. Okay. Yeah, that is, it's it's the same

254
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:25,805
Speaker 5:  case of this. You're like, is it really like, am I

255
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:29,765
Speaker 5:  gonna notice the weight difference? Is it really that slim? You know, you

256
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:32,805
Speaker 5:  see the specs on paper, you're like, what? What's the big deal? And then

257
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:36,205
Speaker 5:  you pick it up and you're like, oh, I get it. This, this really is

258
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:38,685
Speaker 6:  Different. It's very tactile because I, I'll admit to be one of the people

259
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:42,005
Speaker 6:  that looks at those things and, and I'm just like, whatever. It's thin. Do

260
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:45,245
Speaker 6:  we not remember exploding batteries? What are you doing? Oh, Samsung

261
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:46,485
Speaker 5:  Remembers. Oh,

262
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:49,565
Speaker 6:  Samsung remembers exploding batteries. But then you hold it in your hand

263
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:50,325
Speaker 6:  and you go like, oh

264
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:51,265
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

265
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:55,225
Speaker 6:  That's actually quite nice. It's, it's, it feels kind of funny to

266
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:58,985
Speaker 6:  say like, oh, you have to hold it or you have to see it. But I think you

267
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,025
Speaker 6:  should. I know. I think you should. And

268
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:04,345
Speaker 5:  It is true. It's, I'm seeing that a lot this year and it's

269
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:06,545
Speaker 5:  irritating. So I apologize. It's,

270
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:09,425
Speaker 4:  Well, it is like, I mean there are probably a couple of things that are,

271
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:13,385
Speaker 4:  are preventing people from adopting these, like the

272
00:17:13,385 --> 00:17:16,465
Speaker 4:  folding phones, at least this, this sort of fold out style.

273
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:22,025
Speaker 4:  And one is definitely the size, right? Like this one is, I

274
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:25,825
Speaker 4:  think about as close as you can get to just a regular

275
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:29,345
Speaker 4:  phone. I look this up, this is what I,

276
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:32,985
Speaker 4:  it's it's not even a full millimeter

277
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:37,145
Speaker 4:  thicker than the iPhone 16 pro. It's, it's like there's a, a

278
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:40,985
Speaker 4:  very small difference. Yeah. And so it feels like a regular phone, which

279
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:44,065
Speaker 4:  goes a really long way. But then I think there are like two other things

280
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:48,025
Speaker 4:  that I, at least like for me, I don't quite get. And one is

281
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:52,365
Speaker 4:  I love, I I love it. It's freaking cool. Like if you could, if I could trade

282
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:56,165
Speaker 4:  my phone out for a foldable right now, no problem. But like, I

283
00:17:56,165 --> 00:18:00,125
Speaker 4:  don't, I don't totally know what I would use it for. And then

284
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:04,085
Speaker 4:  the other part of that is like the price and this one, it

285
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:07,805
Speaker 4:  is two grand. Is that right? Two grand. Two grand. Yeah. Like that's,

286
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:11,885
Speaker 4:  that's that is the price of two other phones. Yes. Which it is, it is

287
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:15,405
Speaker 4:  sort of two phones table together. Budget. Yeah. Four if you're going budget,

288
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:19,125
Speaker 4:  which, you know, you can do some crazy things if you just, you know, tape

289
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:19,885
Speaker 4:  a few phones together.

290
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:21,205
Speaker 6:  I four pixel

291
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:22,525
Speaker 5:  90. Wild. It's wild. Wild.

292
00:18:23,155 --> 00:18:23,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

293
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:26,565
Speaker 6:  I would love to see two phones taped together and see if that would work

294
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:26,845
Speaker 6:  as

295
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:28,525
Speaker 5:  Ful, you know. But that's

296
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:32,285
Speaker 4:  Funny. You know, you might, are you finding it to be useful as a thing as

297
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:35,765
Speaker 4:  like a tablet? I mean you, I can't believe you live blog in

298
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,525
Speaker 4:  WordPress. This is No,

299
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:39,845
Speaker 6:  I was trying, oh my god. I was like, I was watching her do it And I was like,

300
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:43,285
Speaker 6:  should I try doing it on my phone? I could not do it. No. Just because like

301
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:44,005
Speaker 6:  of all the like little,

302
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:46,365
Speaker 4:  I can't even log into WordPress on my

303
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:49,445
Speaker 6:  Phone. It's, it was pretty rough. I was trying to do like, we have Okta,

304
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:53,365
Speaker 6:  so I was trying to get the Okta code from one phone and putting it on the

305
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:57,045
Speaker 6:  other phone. And I swear to God I felt like this

306
00:18:57,145 --> 00:19:00,405
Speaker 6:  was the ad that Samsung should have. They should have just been

307
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:04,445
Speaker 6:  zeroing in on me and Allison and just me being like, oh,

308
00:19:04,635 --> 00:19:08,605
Speaker 6:  what am I doing? My laptop and two phones aren't working. Allison iss

309
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:12,485
Speaker 6:  just like, cool compose, compose. I'm watching her take a photo and

310
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,445
Speaker 6:  then like, she had Slack on one side and WordPress open

311
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:18,805
Speaker 6:  on the other side and just checking things. And then like, when she needed

312
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:21,885
Speaker 6:  to write, like, I'm sorry if I was stalking you watching this, but please,

313
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:25,605
Speaker 6:  I was just like mesmerized as watching her do this And I was like, oh my

314
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:29,245
Speaker 6:  God, this is the first time I've actually understood why I might want a foldable,

315
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:32,845
Speaker 6:  I want a fold foldable phone. I don't know, maybe could this be a work expense?

316
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:36,845
Speaker 6:  Like could we just have like foldable phones for, for, for live blocking?

317
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:38,925
Speaker 6:  I was like, oh, I

318
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:42,805
Speaker 5:  Approve that you didn't get the memo. I decided we can all have a

319
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:44,165
Speaker 6:  Photoable phone. Okay, cool. That

320
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:47,165
Speaker 4:  Also, Hey Jake. Okay great. That's what I think. I think so I'll just, let

321
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,085
Speaker 4:  me just check with a couple

322
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:48,405
Speaker 6:  People

323
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:52,605
Speaker 4:  That really fast. I Eli's gone like, who's gonna stop

324
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:54,885
Speaker 4:  us? There's no rules now that I think about charge Jake. So there are no

325
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:57,485
Speaker 4:  rules. No, don't. If it's a responsibility's on me, then I have a problem.

326
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:02,885
Speaker 4:  We do need to, to start expensing stuff before new life's back though. That's,

327
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:06,805
Speaker 4:  yeah. That's what's important. This is really like, it is

328
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:10,765
Speaker 4:  true. You see this one and you go, okay, like this. Listen, we're

329
00:20:10,785 --> 00:20:14,205
Speaker 4:  the reasons we're all here is because we have a problem of looking at gadgets

330
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:17,925
Speaker 4:  and going on. I Yeah. But like the, you know, this is

331
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:21,925
Speaker 4:  the first foldable where I've really been like, that's a problem

332
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:25,965
Speaker 4:  that like, it looks great. The, okay, that

333
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:28,965
Speaker 4:  being said, like the foldables that I see out in public

334
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:34,095
Speaker 4:  nine times outta 10, it is the clamshell style. Yeah. Yeah. Which I

335
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:37,375
Speaker 4:  feel a lot more popular than, than

336
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:42,055
Speaker 4:  I, I I don't know. I would imagine they would be. Yeah, I

337
00:20:42,055 --> 00:20:45,175
Speaker 6:  Just think they're familiar. Right? 'cause we all, well maybe not all of

338
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:49,085
Speaker 6:  us. There might be Jins who didn't have the flip phones from back in the

339
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:52,685
Speaker 6:  day, but I feel like a certain nostalgia with the, the flip. Yeah. Also the

340
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,485
Speaker 6:  flip is just really cute. It's like you look at in person, you're like, oh

341
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:58,205
Speaker 6:  my God, this is so cute. And even with the Marola phones, you just go, oh

342
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:01,165
Speaker 6:  cool. And then when it folds open, it's a form factor you're used to using.

343
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:05,245
Speaker 6:  It's the same thing. Whereas with the, with the fold open like a tablet.

344
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:09,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean I think tablets as a device even, I'm not sure what to

345
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:10,485
Speaker 6:  do with my iPad half the time.

346
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:11,965
Speaker 5:  Same. Yeah. I think that's

347
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:16,045
Speaker 6:  The Yeah, I think that's the, the, the prob the quote unquote problem with

348
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:19,885
Speaker 6:  the tablets. Yeah. Oh. If you watch KDRs, there's always just a random

349
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:23,605
Speaker 6:  person who shouldn't be able to like, afford foldable. Just going like,

350
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:27,325
Speaker 6:  oh, let me have my foldable and use it in this way. Because Samsung,

351
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:31,845
Speaker 6:  I mean Samsung runs Korea. So like, they're just like, here we go, we're

352
00:21:31,845 --> 00:21:35,765
Speaker 6:  gonna put foldables and random K dramas. And I, whenever it pops

353
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:39,725
Speaker 6:  up, I'm like, I I That's not believable. Samsung. Yeah. This is the poor

354
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:43,605
Speaker 6:  girl being courted by the rich guy. How does she have a foldable phone?

355
00:21:43,675 --> 00:21:47,525
Speaker 5:  Well, she could buy the FE flip phone. I

356
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:51,125
Speaker 5:  love that segue. Which 8 99 instead of ten ninety nine?

357
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:55,005
Speaker 5:  No, the the flip phones. I think you're right. It is a really familiar form

358
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:58,725
Speaker 5:  factor. They are a little less expensive. Like a thousand dollars

359
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:02,365
Speaker 5:  is what a phone costs. So you're, you're not making that leap to like, I'm

360
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:06,285
Speaker 5:  buying two phones And I think the use cases are a little more like

361
00:22:06,555 --> 00:22:10,285
Speaker 5:  immediate. Like you prop it up, you take a selfie with

362
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:14,285
Speaker 5:  the, the main camera that doesn't suck. And like you get

363
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:18,125
Speaker 5:  that immediately. And I love 'em. Like I

364
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:21,685
Speaker 5:  run apps on the front. I'm like starting my little Strava

365
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:25,965
Speaker 5:  cycling rides. I, you know, check the bus schedule.

366
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:27,885
Speaker 5:  I do all kinds of things on the flip phone

367
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:30,765
Speaker 4:  Really quickly. I just wanna ask, why do you hate the FE so much?

368
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:32,565
Speaker 5:  It's just, okay, I

369
00:22:32,565 --> 00:22:32,725
Speaker 6:  Keep,

370
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:37,165
Speaker 5:  I keep forgetting about it because this is a two phone event. You know, we

371
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:41,045
Speaker 5:  have a flip and a fold, but it's also like

372
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:44,005
Speaker 5:  8 99 is not that much cheaper, you know? Yeah, yeah.

373
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:46,405
Speaker 4:  Is it just last year's phone? Like it's

374
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:50,005
Speaker 5:  Like, pretty much, yeah. Yeah. I think they, they maybe like rearrange some

375
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:53,845
Speaker 5:  parts, but yeah, I'm like, okay, so you can buy last year's phone for

376
00:22:54,295 --> 00:22:58,245
Speaker 5:  eight ninety nine. Motorola sells one for 6 99. Yeah, that's, come

377
00:22:58,265 --> 00:22:58,685
Speaker 5:  on. That's

378
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:02,765
Speaker 4:  Okay. Okay. So then they did the phones then whole bunch of watches.

379
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:05,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Alright. What do we see from Samsung on the watches front?

380
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:10,485
Speaker 6:  So we saw a, the Galaxy Watch eight series,

381
00:23:10,485 --> 00:23:14,405
Speaker 6:  which includes the Base Galaxy Watch eight and the Galaxy Watch eight classic

382
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:18,085
Speaker 6:  and an extremely minorly updated Galaxy Watch Ultra,

383
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:22,325
Speaker 6:  basically Squirl are everywhere. Huge redesign. And

384
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:26,205
Speaker 6:  then Gemini is on the wrist now thanks to wear OS six. And there's

385
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:29,525
Speaker 6:  a bunch of new health features. The, I think the big marquee one that they

386
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:33,325
Speaker 6:  played up a bit was a running coach. It, it's just a running

387
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:37,365
Speaker 6:  coach. You take a 12 minute run test and it grades you and then

388
00:23:37,365 --> 00:23:41,245
Speaker 6:  creates an AI generated program for you. And then the antioxidant

389
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:45,350
Speaker 6:  index, which is their foray into nutrition and kind of telling

390
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,285
Speaker 6:  you, are you eating healthily? You probably know

391
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:52,565
Speaker 6:  the answer to that already. And then, you know, there was a bit of a price

392
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:56,285
Speaker 6:  bump. So the eight got about $50 more

393
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:59,685
Speaker 6:  expensive and the starting price. And the classic unfortunately is about

394
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:03,645
Speaker 6:  a hundred dollars more at 4 99. So the ultra

395
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:07,445
Speaker 6:  stayed the same, which is good news because it literally got a new color

396
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:10,685
Speaker 6:  and a storage bump. So that's it. That's the Squircle squad.

397
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:12,845
Speaker 4:  It's a total redesign. Right?

398
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:16,925
Speaker 6:  Total redesign. So Samsung has always been known for these circular

399
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:20,805
Speaker 6:  watches, which stand in complete contrast to the Apple

400
00:24:20,805 --> 00:24:23,925
Speaker 6:  watches, which, you know, I mean, I got it right here, right? So like the

401
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:27,725
Speaker 6:  Apple watch is squareish and then we have this, which is

402
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,005
Speaker 4:  Confusing. Confusing.

403
00:24:29,205 --> 00:24:29,365
Speaker 6:  This

404
00:24:29,365 --> 00:24:31,965
Speaker 4:  Is what I would say. I'm looking at it And I don't know what shape I'm seeing.

405
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:32,285
Speaker 4:  And

406
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:34,845
Speaker 6:  You are seeing a squirkle my friend because the, the

407
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:37,405
Speaker 4:  The the the, they couldn't decide and they did both. They

408
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:41,325
Speaker 6:  Couldn't decide they did it both. This is the circle watch face on

409
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:45,445
Speaker 6:  a square, what they're calling it is a cushion, it's a square

410
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:49,125
Speaker 6:  cushion. Mm. And they have three reasons for that. Three reasons.

411
00:24:49,825 --> 00:24:53,765
Speaker 6:  One is that it allows the, the watch to sit flatter on your

412
00:24:53,765 --> 00:24:57,405
Speaker 6:  wrist. So better contact with the sensor underneath. Two,

413
00:24:57,905 --> 00:25:01,685
Speaker 6:  it allows it to be thinner. So this is supposedly eight 11%

414
00:25:01,685 --> 00:25:05,565
Speaker 6:  thinner than last year's. And then three, you can house

415
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:09,605
Speaker 6:  a slightly bigger battery inside and don't get too excited. It's like we're

416
00:25:09,605 --> 00:25:13,445
Speaker 6:  talking like 10, 10 milliamp hour more, or

417
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:17,405
Speaker 6:  like somewhere between 10 and 20 is what, 'cause I was going through the

418
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:21,365
Speaker 6:  spec sheet and looking And I was like, oh, that, that's like an extra hour

419
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:24,725
Speaker 6:  maybe of battery life that we're looking at n nothing too special

420
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:29,125
Speaker 6:  there. So yeah. Squi goals, I think, I mean

421
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:32,685
Speaker 6:  based on on the comments that I've seen from people already, a lot of people

422
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:34,685
Speaker 6:  hate it. Okay.

423
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:39,085
Speaker 4:  I watched your video yesterday And I was like convincing my,

424
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:42,645
Speaker 4:  I was try, I was trying to gear, I was like, you know what, maybe I like

425
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:45,765
Speaker 4:  this. Maybe this is cool. I mean I was like, I'm gonna come in and I'm gonna

426
00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:49,405
Speaker 4:  be the positive one and now I'm seeing it in person And I cannot do it. It

427
00:25:49,405 --> 00:25:49,645
Speaker 4:  is not,

428
00:25:49,985 --> 00:25:53,205
Speaker 6:  That's not great because I think this is the best looking of the Squirkle

429
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:56,765
Speaker 6:  watches. No, because it's slightly no. Well this one or the classic

430
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:00,645
Speaker 6:  because on the classic they have the rotating bezel. So

431
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:04,525
Speaker 6:  I love the rotating bezel. It is such a storied part of the Samsung

432
00:26:04,695 --> 00:26:07,965
Speaker 6:  watch design because it'll, you know, it rotates and it's so satisfying.

433
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:11,885
Speaker 6:  It's so cliquey and like when you think about going through menus, you're

434
00:26:11,885 --> 00:26:15,645
Speaker 6:  not touching the screen with your grubby finger oils. So it's, it's actually

435
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:17,125
Speaker 6:  quite nice. This is the base.

436
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,845
Speaker 4:  It was it, the hardware looks really polished.

437
00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:21,605
Speaker 6:  It does look

438
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:25,325
Speaker 4:  Really polished. It, it, it's the design. I'm gonna put question mark this

439
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:25,725
Speaker 4:  question

440
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:28,805
Speaker 6:  Mark this, this is the sleek ITT looking of them. And when I had all of them

441
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:32,965
Speaker 6:  in person And I had like the comparison to the last six

442
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:36,885
Speaker 6:  classic and looking at them I was like, okay, you know, I dunno, I don't

443
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:39,525
Speaker 6:  think it's Stockholm syndrome. 'cause I had Allison try it on and she was

444
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:42,685
Speaker 6:  like, yes, it does sit flatter and it it is more comfortable. And I was like,

445
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:46,645
Speaker 6:  okay. I could, it's not so egregious. But I still think that the

446
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:50,605
Speaker 6:  ultra, which they, they basically took this design idea from the

447
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:54,125
Speaker 6:  ultra, it's Ogo. It's

448
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,605
Speaker 4:  Fogo Ogo. Yeah. It's really

449
00:26:55,665 --> 00:26:58,845
Speaker 6:  Big. It's really big. Like, not this one, but like when you, when I put the

450
00:26:58,895 --> 00:27:02,765
Speaker 6:  Ultra on Owen, our video guy was like, wow, you could

451
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:06,445
Speaker 6:  drive a truck through those lugs gaps. 'cause like here you don't really

452
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:10,005
Speaker 6:  see the lug gaps on my tiny little wrist. But on the ultra,

453
00:27:11,285 --> 00:27:14,485
Speaker 6:  I, I think last year I tested And I could stick three chopsticks in the gaps.

454
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:18,605
Speaker 6:  So like six total too many. It's, it's, it's too many chops.

455
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:22,565
Speaker 6:  It's, it's, it's a lot. I don't feel Stockholm

456
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:25,245
Speaker 6:  syndromed by this one. I think I could get to.

457
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:29,375
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah,

458
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,695
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah. That's, it's,

459
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:31,295
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's,

460
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:34,095
Speaker 4:  It's, it's, I think it's confusing because you look at it and you're like,

461
00:27:34,095 --> 00:27:37,935
Speaker 4:  wow, that's a really well made confusing shape. It's

462
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:41,695
Speaker 4:  like it's, it is like, they did a great job. I just don't know

463
00:27:41,765 --> 00:27:42,535
Speaker 4:  what they did.

464
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:47,335
Speaker 6:  I think it looks best on this one because it still maintains like a thin,

465
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:50,295
Speaker 6:  sleek look on the classic. It's just like,

466
00:27:51,915 --> 00:27:55,215
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm swayed by the rotating bezel. At least that's still there. And on

467
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,655
Speaker 6:  the ultra, I, I still can't, the ultra,

468
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:02,775
Speaker 6:  like I still can't, the blue color does make it look slightly

469
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:03,335
Speaker 6:  better.

470
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:08,055
Speaker 4:  But did the ultra, there's no, it's just, it's just like a processor bump.

471
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:08,575
Speaker 4:  What what's,

472
00:28:08,595 --> 00:28:12,295
Speaker 6:  Oh, not even a processor bump. This, this is what you get. It's blue.

473
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,375
Speaker 4:  It's blue. Mm.

474
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:14,735
Speaker 6:  And double the storage.

475
00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:16,685
Speaker 4:  Okay. That's okay.

476
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:18,485
Speaker 6:  That's my main concern on a watch.

477
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:19,165
Speaker 4:  Yes.

478
00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:23,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So you can have more songs on there and apps I guess.

479
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:27,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah, double the storage. The classic, the only hardware

480
00:28:27,435 --> 00:28:31,365
Speaker 6:  updates on the classic is that it gets the ultra's third quick button,

481
00:28:31,365 --> 00:28:35,125
Speaker 6:  which is like a thing that you can use to launch an

482
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:38,925
Speaker 6:  extra shortcut or something on that. And then all of the watches have a new

483
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:43,045
Speaker 6:  lug system, which I know everybody loves a new lug system for easier

484
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:43,685
Speaker 6:  swapping.

485
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,085
Speaker 4:  Oh, it's always good when the lugs change.

486
00:28:45,745 --> 00:28:48,285
Speaker 6:  Oh, not, not always. Yes. 'cause like I do have a bunch of readers going,

487
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:51,885
Speaker 6:  well there goes the investment I had and all of these

488
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:56,005
Speaker 6:  straps. Mm. And which is why I say be careful with

489
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:59,485
Speaker 6:  how many straps you invest in and from where because yeah. Don't fall in

490
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:02,285
Speaker 6:  love with the strap. Don't fall in love with the straps too much. Because

491
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:05,725
Speaker 6:  a lot of times they will change these designs and the lug systems and then

492
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:08,125
Speaker 6:  you're stuck with straps that can't be carried forward.

493
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:11,285
Speaker 4:  Okay. I wanna ask you about something else. I saw that there is an

494
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:13,005
Speaker 4:  antioxidant. Oh boy

495
00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:13,285
Speaker 6:  Sensor.

496
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:17,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I, every year, like a

497
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:20,965
Speaker 4:  new sensor is added to smartwatches. And first I go, that's crazy.

498
00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:24,005
Speaker 4:  I didn't know we could measure that. Like on the skin.

499
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:28,405
Speaker 4:  Antioxidants are on your s like through I I didn't know that. The next

500
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:32,285
Speaker 4:  thing I go is, I don't know what to do with that. Like, that sounds so

501
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:33,565
Speaker 4:  cool. And I don't know what,

502
00:29:33,795 --> 00:29:36,005
Speaker 6:  Okay, so like here's

503
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,885
Speaker 4:  V's are the runners psyched for this?

504
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:41,845
Speaker 6:  No, here's v's. Runner. No, not runner, but here's

505
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:45,825
Speaker 6:  v's. Health tech soapbox. So is it very

506
00:29:45,895 --> 00:29:49,785
Speaker 6:  cool that, so they introduced this new bioactive sensor last year, which

507
00:29:49,785 --> 00:29:53,665
Speaker 6:  has a bunch of different colors of LEDs. Normally it's red, infrared and

508
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:57,505
Speaker 6:  green. But this one has stuff like purple, yellow, blue. And that's supposed

509
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:00,905
Speaker 6:  to enable like new things. So the way the

510
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:04,305
Speaker 6:  antioxidant thing works is that it uses a combination of

511
00:30:05,185 --> 00:30:08,665
Speaker 6:  a few of the sensors, I think like blue, yellow, maybe another one.

512
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:12,785
Speaker 6:  And you actually have to take the watch off for this, this

513
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:15,425
Speaker 6:  pass feature to work pass pass. Already. You have to take the watch off and

514
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:19,345
Speaker 6:  you put your, your little thumb on it and then it, it reads the

515
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:23,185
Speaker 6:  carotenoid levels in your skin. And carotenoids are a type of

516
00:30:24,775 --> 00:30:28,585
Speaker 6:  pigment basically that are, it's a type of antioxidant pigment in

517
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:33,025
Speaker 6:  like betacarotene. It makes plants like

518
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:37,185
Speaker 6:  orange. That's the thing in carrots that make 'em orange. It's the thing

519
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:41,065
Speaker 6:  that makes bell peppers like red and yellow. And

520
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:44,715
Speaker 6:  so when you eat, they get into your skin, you know, if you have too much

521
00:30:44,745 --> 00:30:47,115
Speaker 6:  carrots you might turn orange. So it's picking up the

522
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:51,875
Speaker 6:  carotinoids in that. And you know, I'm, I'm there in this

523
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:56,235
Speaker 6:  round table with the Samsung execs talking about it. And in my head I'm going,

524
00:30:56,265 --> 00:31:00,075
Speaker 6:  okay, well what if you eat berries because

525
00:31:00,315 --> 00:31:03,435
Speaker 6:  berries don't have carotinoids in them but they have antioxidants and they're

526
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:05,915
Speaker 6:  very good for you. Are they, is that gonna show up in your thing? Because

527
00:31:06,315 --> 00:31:09,875
Speaker 6:  I went And I did the demo and it said I had very low antioxidants And I was

528
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:12,355
Speaker 6:  like, that doesn't make any sense. I had so many berries over the weekend.

529
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:16,555
Speaker 6:  It's 'cause there's no carotinoids or like very low levels of OIDs in

530
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,235
Speaker 6:  there. And because it's reading it from your skin, it could take as many

531
00:31:19,255 --> 00:31:22,595
Speaker 6:  as a couple, like two weeks for it to actually show up. So

532
00:31:23,025 --> 00:31:26,835
Speaker 6:  fundamentally what this thing is doing is saying, are you eating

533
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:29,235
Speaker 6:  enough fruits and veggies? You already know the answer.

534
00:31:29,295 --> 00:31:32,795
Speaker 4:  If they had to advertise this as a carrot sensor, I would've been

535
00:31:33,095 --> 00:31:37,035
Speaker 4:  so much more excited. Like, let it be dumb, let it be

536
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:40,795
Speaker 4:  silly. Let it be unimportant. As of like right now, all the smart watchers,

537
00:31:40,795 --> 00:31:44,275
Speaker 4:  they just keep adding sensors that and then being like, we don't know what

538
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:46,475
Speaker 4:  to do with them. Here they are, here here's

539
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:47,715
Speaker 6:  More quantified data free.

540
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:50,755
Speaker 4:  If they had just said carrot sensor, great. Like, everyone would be like,

541
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:54,355
Speaker 4:  cool. This like the, it works as functioned. We, we,

542
00:31:54,485 --> 00:31:57,555
Speaker 4:  first off, I need you to test this. I will,

543
00:31:57,675 --> 00:31:58,075
Speaker 6:  I need you to,

544
00:31:58,355 --> 00:31:59,915
Speaker 4:  I I'll be testing a lot of carrots.

545
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:01,315
Speaker 6:  You test it on a carrot.

546
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:02,635
Speaker 4:  What is, oh my god.

547
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:05,995
Speaker 6:  What will happen? I'll try. Okay. We'll see what happens. I'll just like

548
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:09,955
Speaker 6:  smush a carrot into the sensor. That's, that's a thing I'm gonna do.

549
00:32:10,975 --> 00:32:14,395
Speaker 6:  But yeah, so my, my main beef with this is that we all

550
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:18,115
Speaker 6:  generally know that you should eat more fruits and vegetables. And so all

551
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:21,195
Speaker 6:  this is telling you is whether or not you're eating fruits and vegetables

552
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:25,075
Speaker 6:  to an adequate amount. And I think we all deeply know in our hearts whether

553
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:28,995
Speaker 6:  we are so, I mean they were saying that

554
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:32,875
Speaker 6:  fevers or drinking alcoholic drinks could cause your score to lower

555
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:36,675
Speaker 6:  well, you know, that fevers and alcoholic drinks are, you know,

556
00:32:36,685 --> 00:32:40,565
Speaker 6:  going to maybe cause your data to dip. Like, whoa, wow.

557
00:32:41,105 --> 00:32:42,445
Speaker 6:  Wow. Thanks, thanks.

558
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:47,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think some people might enjoy it and find it useful. But

559
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,495
Speaker 6:  I'm sort of like a duh

560
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:54,695
Speaker 4:  Quiles antioxidants, I would, I'm gonna say

561
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:58,175
Speaker 4:  confusing year for, for the smart watch line. General. General and general.

562
00:32:58,365 --> 00:32:58,815
Speaker 4:  Okay. They have

563
00:32:58,815 --> 00:33:01,735
Speaker 6:  Gemini Geminis on there, which I still think will confuse people because

564
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:04,575
Speaker 6:  it's replacing Google Assistant on the watches.

565
00:33:06,265 --> 00:33:09,805
Speaker 6:  And you know, you have generative AI on your watch.

566
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:12,965
Speaker 6:  What are you gonna do with generative AI on your watch?

567
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:17,565
Speaker 6:  Samsung is very like focused on diets basically. 'cause the

568
00:33:17,565 --> 00:33:21,285
Speaker 6:  examples they were giving me were like start a run for, for

569
00:33:21,285 --> 00:33:24,285
Speaker 6:  exactly the number of calories in a slice of pizza. And I was like, that's

570
00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:25,325
Speaker 6:  diabolical. Why,

571
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:27,925
Speaker 4:  Why does it have access to your health data?

572
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:30,125
Speaker 6:  Theoretically? Yes.

573
00:33:30,715 --> 00:33:32,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This is theoretically

574
00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:34,125
Speaker 6:  Yes. So it it

575
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,125
Speaker 4:  Could, it could,

576
00:33:35,605 --> 00:33:39,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I like, from what I can tell the Gemini aspect of it is that

577
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:43,405
Speaker 6:  it can handle more complex queries that might require multiple apps in a

578
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:47,245
Speaker 6:  sequential order. Mm. So you can say something like, find

579
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:51,365
Speaker 6:  the coolest coffee shop near here and message the

580
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:55,525
Speaker 6:  location to Allison and it'll do that directly from the wrist. I like that

581
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:59,285
Speaker 6:  provided that you are logged into all the relevant apps. Because

582
00:33:59,685 --> 00:34:03,645
Speaker 6:  in the demo space I was trying it like away from the, the people who had

583
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:06,765
Speaker 6:  the guardrail demos where it would be guaranteed to work. And I was like,

584
00:34:06,765 --> 00:34:10,765
Speaker 6:  hey, there's a little one with Gemini, let me see if it works. And it

585
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:14,045
Speaker 6:  was like, well you're gonna have to log into YouTube music to make this playlist.

586
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:16,965
Speaker 6:  And I, it was like, oh, okay. So you have to log into a bunch of stuff.

587
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:21,285
Speaker 4:  You know, that reminds me of what Apple's Craig Federici said. He

588
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:24,805
Speaker 4:  was talking to Joanna Stern from the Wall Street Journal and she asked him

589
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:28,405
Speaker 4:  about OpenAI buying io, which is Johnny Ives

590
00:34:28,785 --> 00:34:32,685
Speaker 4:  new hardware startup. And you know, they're working on some sort

591
00:34:32,685 --> 00:34:36,485
Speaker 4:  of AI device and Joanna's like, well what do you got? And Craig

592
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:40,445
Speaker 4:  go says, Hey, I think we have a really personal device already.

593
00:34:40,465 --> 00:34:44,205
Speaker 4:  And he is like, you know, pointing to the Apple watch. And So there is something

594
00:34:44,205 --> 00:34:47,205
Speaker 4:  there, right where Apple is sort of pointing to actually the trajectory for

595
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:51,365
Speaker 4:  AI is wearable and Samsung is, you know,

596
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:55,045
Speaker 4:  big asterisk but like, maybe, maybe getting there first

597
00:34:55,715 --> 00:34:59,365
Speaker 6:  Sort of Yes. Sort of, sort of getting there first. Yeah. I've gotten a few

598
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:03,125
Speaker 6:  demos. So I got a demo with Google earlier this week as well for, And I was

599
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:06,925
Speaker 6:  just like, gimme ideas for what? And I would love if our listeners also had

600
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:10,285
Speaker 6:  ideas to Yeah. To send me, because it's such a fundamental

601
00:35:10,335 --> 00:35:14,285
Speaker 6:  difference in thinking like writing AI prompts, you're kind of teaching

602
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:18,205
Speaker 6:  your brain to have a different language and putting it on

603
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:21,445
Speaker 6:  the wrist when your muscle memory is so strong to just like, oh, I need to

604
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:24,325
Speaker 6:  look up a thing. Lemme just grab my phone. So now you're teaching yourself

605
00:35:24,365 --> 00:35:27,805
Speaker 6:  a different muscle memory or like, I'm not gonna grab my phone, I'll just

606
00:35:27,805 --> 00:35:31,045
Speaker 6:  ask it on my watch. When would I do that? Versus

607
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:35,485
Speaker 6:  just pulling out my phone, which is faster. And so

608
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:39,685
Speaker 6:  I think that's gonna be an, an interesting tension to kind of work with

609
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:43,365
Speaker 6:  while I review it. But I, I'm, I'm not saying it's gonna be bad,

610
00:35:44,465 --> 00:35:47,735
Speaker 6:  I'm just gonna say I'm, I think, I don't know

611
00:35:47,825 --> 00:35:51,695
Speaker 6:  personally how it's going to work for me yet. And like what part of the

612
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:55,215
Speaker 6:  generative features Yeah. Will be most useful. So

613
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:56,015
Speaker 6:  we'll see.

614
00:35:56,095 --> 00:35:59,735
Speaker 5:  Do you, do you talk to AI or do you like to type more? I

615
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:03,135
Speaker 6:  Like to type, so like my thing Yeah. Is like, and you know, it's different

616
00:36:03,135 --> 00:36:06,775
Speaker 6:  for different people. I know low and blind vision people really value the

617
00:36:06,775 --> 00:36:10,095
Speaker 6:  voice aspect of it. But for me, I don't want people hearing, I

618
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:12,015
Speaker 5:  Know my stupid questions. It's embarrassing. I

619
00:36:12,015 --> 00:36:12,895
Speaker 6:  Have some very stupid

620
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:16,815
Speaker 5:  Questions. I don't even wanna hear it myself. I would rather just keep it

621
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:19,375
Speaker 6:  Quiet. Yeah. And like the thing about Gemini that they're saying is that

622
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:23,055
Speaker 6:  it's natural language, but then now I have to undo my muscle

623
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,655
Speaker 6:  memory of how I talk to assistant. Because when you talk to assistant, it's

624
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:29,975
Speaker 6:  like, hey, And I'm not gonna say the wake word because we've had enough

625
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:34,495
Speaker 6:  of our listeners say, you said the wake word. So like, hey

626
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:36,055
Speaker 6:  AI assistant

627
00:36:37,785 --> 00:36:41,755
Speaker 6:  send message and then you have to dictate it. Yeah. So like, I think

628
00:36:41,855 --> 00:36:43,915
Speaker 6:  one of the things that you're supposed to be able to do is like, be like,

629
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:47,155
Speaker 6:  oh, I'm late. Can you send a message to this person telling them I'm gonna

630
00:36:47,155 --> 00:36:51,075
Speaker 6:  be late and make the tone polite or apologetic and that's

631
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,875
Speaker 6:  a thing that you can do and it'll just write the message for you and you

632
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:57,795
Speaker 6:  don't have to dictate it. And I'm like, cool. But I'm

633
00:36:57,795 --> 00:37:01,235
Speaker 6:  kind of used to dictating it. So it, it's really,

634
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:05,115
Speaker 6:  I I I think people are just gonna have to be open to changing

635
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:09,435
Speaker 6:  their muscle, like memory and then changing muscle memory is really difficult

636
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:13,235
Speaker 6:  to do. So I think that's the, the big challenge with Gemini on the wrist.

637
00:37:13,255 --> 00:37:16,875
Speaker 4:  That's real. Okay. There's one other Samsung thing that was like

638
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:20,555
Speaker 4:  around the event, but not, I believe it was not at the event, which is

639
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:24,915
Speaker 4:  there was a big leak that they're having a, a tri-fold foldable.

640
00:37:25,655 --> 00:37:27,755
Speaker 4:  And they did, they, they didn't say anything about this? No,

641
00:37:27,855 --> 00:37:31,515
Speaker 5:  Not a thing. And I was ready for it because she was, they've done,

642
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:35,475
Speaker 5:  here's what I wanna see. They've done kind of a one more thing. But I guess

643
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:39,035
Speaker 5:  that was at the January unpack. 'cause they did it for the ring, they did

644
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:40,635
Speaker 5:  it for the edge.

645
00:37:42,915 --> 00:37:43,195
Speaker 5:  I was like,

646
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:46,955
Speaker 6:  They were wrapping, they were wrapping up and Allison just has her thing

647
00:37:47,155 --> 00:37:49,715
Speaker 6:  up and she goes like, I don't believe you is

648
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:53,035
Speaker 5:  What she says. I know. I was like, you can't fool me tm.

649
00:37:54,175 --> 00:37:55,835
Speaker 5:  But yeah, they fooled me. Okay. There was no,

650
00:37:56,655 --> 00:37:59,835
Speaker 4:  So there's, there's more to come in in Samsung foldables. It's potentially

651
00:37:59,835 --> 00:38:00,755
Speaker 4:  even this year it sounds like.

652
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:03,235
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like they told

653
00:40:45,785 --> 00:40:49,245
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. There were a bunch of really big

654
00:40:49,315 --> 00:40:52,765
Speaker 4:  executive changes this week at Apple, at Meta

655
00:40:53,145 --> 00:40:57,125
Speaker 4:  at x gr went absolutely off the rails, Lots to talk

656
00:40:57,125 --> 00:41:00,685
Speaker 4:  about. I wanna start with Apple where their COO Jeff Williams

657
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:04,685
Speaker 4:  announced plans to retire. This is really

658
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:08,925
Speaker 4:  interesting because Jeff Williams was, I guess until

659
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:09,965
Speaker 4:  Tuesday,

660
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:15,325
Speaker 4:  you know, one of the leading people who was seen as a

661
00:41:15,565 --> 00:41:19,245
Speaker 4:  possible Tim Cook successor if it came to that. Right. And

662
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:23,525
Speaker 4:  I think this is happening in like the most Apple way possible, right? It's

663
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:24,605
Speaker 4:  a long, slow thing.

664
00:41:25,405 --> 00:41:29,285
Speaker 6:  I mean, does Apple do anything quickly? I don't think so. They're very

665
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:32,725
Speaker 6:  intentional about everything, right? So yeah, no, but Jeff Williams,

666
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:37,005
Speaker 6:  he's always in those like big presentations at the

667
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:40,725
Speaker 6:  iPhone event. Like he's one of those FE he's maybe not

668
00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:44,365
Speaker 6:  Craig Feig Federighi where he has his own hair meme at this point

669
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:48,205
Speaker 6:  where you go to dub dub and they're referencing his hair and, and the filmed

670
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:51,965
Speaker 6:  parts. But he's, he's pretty well known if you're into Apple. So that's a

671
00:41:51,965 --> 00:41:52,725
Speaker 6:  big one. Yeah.

672
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:55,685
Speaker 4:  And I think like as C-O-O-C-O-O is one of those,

673
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:00,685
Speaker 4:  I think quieter but actually mission critical positions. Yeah. At Apple.

674
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:04,545
Speaker 4:  Like Apple is, in many ways it is a supply chain company,

675
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:08,425
Speaker 4:  right? Like Tim Cook was the COO before he was

676
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:12,185
Speaker 4:  C-O-C-E-O. And I think he has in many ways

677
00:42:12,705 --> 00:42:16,265
Speaker 4:  reshaped apple around that role, right? Yeah.

678
00:42:16,435 --> 00:42:20,425
Speaker 4:  Every single product is, you know, how do we make sure there

679
00:42:20,425 --> 00:42:23,785
Speaker 4:  are exactly three versions that we are optimizing the parts and we're using

680
00:42:23,935 --> 00:42:27,905
Speaker 4:  what came last. And, you know, it makes sense

681
00:42:27,905 --> 00:42:31,865
Speaker 4:  that they would've seen Jeff as the possible next guy. And I

682
00:42:31,865 --> 00:42:35,745
Speaker 4:  think like the, the going, you know, speculation from what I've

683
00:42:35,745 --> 00:42:39,735
Speaker 4:  seen is that perhaps Jeff Williams is a

684
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:42,615
Speaker 4:  little, little too old, right? He was 62.

685
00:42:43,555 --> 00:42:47,255
Speaker 4:  Tim Cook is 64. And so if Tim Cook is going to step down

686
00:42:47,595 --> 00:42:51,295
Speaker 4:  at some point, I mean, I don't know. He could, he could Berkshire ha

687
00:42:51,295 --> 00:42:55,215
Speaker 4:  Hathaway this and like, you know, stick around like Warren Buffet until he

688
00:42:55,215 --> 00:42:58,015
Speaker 4:  is like in his nineties, which like, you know, if you're a shareholder,

689
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:01,655
Speaker 6:  I mean Tim Cook is secretly sw like,

690
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:02,335
Speaker 4:  Is he, is he,

691
00:43:02,565 --> 00:43:05,495
Speaker 6:  He's secret there. If you look up the Slate article from the past, it's like,

692
00:43:05,495 --> 00:43:09,135
Speaker 6:  it's an investigation into how SW Tim Cook is. He's very

693
00:43:09,205 --> 00:43:13,015
Speaker 6:  swol. He like famously exercises a lot. Like, oh my God, he, a lot of the

694
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:15,495
Speaker 6:  Apple Watch stuff and the health stuff is because Tim Cook is like super

695
00:43:15,495 --> 00:43:19,295
Speaker 6:  into that stuff. So I don't know. He doesn't look like

696
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:20,855
Speaker 6:  he's aged. No. Do,

697
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:22,375
Speaker 4:  Do we know his workout regimen?

698
00:43:24,175 --> 00:43:27,815
Speaker 6:  I think he wakes up at like 4:00 AM and works out like he's, I don't know

699
00:43:27,815 --> 00:43:31,735
Speaker 6:  the exact of it, but if you look real close and Zoom, he's very modest

700
00:43:31,835 --> 00:43:35,295
Speaker 6:  in his, his attire. But if you zoom in on those biceps,

701
00:43:35,735 --> 00:43:39,615
Speaker 6:  I am a believer that Tim Cook is swollen. So he

702
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:42,095
Speaker 6:  could be, he could be, he could be good for a while.

703
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:44,655
Speaker 4:  He's good for Okay. He's sticking around. Think he's good for a while. Yeah.

704
00:43:44,685 --> 00:43:44,975
Speaker 4:  Like

705
00:43:45,605 --> 00:43:49,535
Speaker 6:  He's a healthy dude. How SW was Jeff Williams? You

706
00:43:49,535 --> 00:43:52,895
Speaker 6:  know, honestly, no, no slate articles. No slate articles

707
00:43:53,415 --> 00:43:56,575
Speaker 6:  investigating Jeff Williams'. Unknown level of swollenness. Yeah, no, that

708
00:43:56,575 --> 00:43:59,735
Speaker 6:  is one of my favorite articles though is Tim k sw. I come back to it every

709
00:43:59,735 --> 00:44:03,575
Speaker 6:  once in a while just 'cause the beat I'm on. And also because when I see

710
00:44:03,575 --> 00:44:07,135
Speaker 6:  him every year I'm like zooming in with my eyes and just going like,

711
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:10,055
Speaker 6:  yeah, no, I think, I think he's sws real swollen.

712
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,335
Speaker 4:  Okay, so, well I guess now I know why, why Jeff was passed over. I mean,

713
00:44:13,335 --> 00:44:16,935
Speaker 4:  you right, this, this is what one assumes if you don't retire. If, if

714
00:44:16,965 --> 00:44:20,815
Speaker 4:  they're like, hey, you might be CEO soon, right? Yeah, yeah. I, it

715
00:44:20,815 --> 00:44:24,055
Speaker 4:  it, to be clear, like it's not like there is a rumor that, that Tim Cook's

716
00:44:24,055 --> 00:44:27,255
Speaker 4:  retirement is imminent, but like, you know, he's, he's been doing it since

717
00:44:27,255 --> 00:44:30,175
Speaker 4:  2012. It's a long time. It's a long time long run.

718
00:44:31,985 --> 00:44:35,885
Speaker 4:  And I think Apple, you know, because they move so carefully,

719
00:44:35,885 --> 00:44:38,845
Speaker 4:  surely they're, they're planning this in the background. So their new guy,

720
00:44:38,955 --> 00:44:42,885
Speaker 4:  they're bringing in Sabi Khan who cook

721
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:46,605
Speaker 4:  called one of the central architects of Apple's supply chain. Like they're

722
00:44:46,605 --> 00:44:50,045
Speaker 4:  clearly trying to be like, nothing's changing, we're all good, everything

723
00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:54,005
Speaker 4:  is safe, it's in safe hands, right? He's,

724
00:44:54,465 --> 00:44:58,405
Speaker 4:  you know, this guy again has been, he's, he joined Apple in 1995. Jesus.

725
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:02,245
Speaker 4:  So right. This is like, this is a, a still a jobs era guy

726
00:45:02,685 --> 00:45:03,325
Speaker 4:  who they're bringing in.

727
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:08,365
Speaker 6:  I mean, supply chain stuff is really important right now with like the, the,

728
00:45:08,365 --> 00:45:11,605
Speaker 6:  the ever looming tariff situation going on. And

729
00:45:12,285 --> 00:45:16,005
Speaker 6:  I don't know, I think you have Apple fans who are kind of

730
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:19,965
Speaker 6:  split into romanticizing the jobs era and like the vision of it all the,

731
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:22,565
Speaker 6:  the jobs and Joni I vision of it all. And then you have other people who

732
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:26,485
Speaker 6:  are like, nah, Tim cook's a guy who gets it done. Mm. And like he's a

733
00:45:26,485 --> 00:45:29,565
Speaker 6:  guy who knows supply chains and that stuff's boring, but that's what makes

734
00:45:29,565 --> 00:45:33,045
Speaker 6:  money. So I think having SoCon there,

735
00:45:33,545 --> 00:45:37,485
Speaker 6:  it just feels stable at a time where supply chain is a thing that

736
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:41,405
Speaker 6:  we think about and something that investors are super invested in

737
00:45:42,665 --> 00:45:46,645
Speaker 6:  is having a stable supply chain. So I think that

738
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:48,245
Speaker 6:  is a signal there too.

739
00:45:48,465 --> 00:45:51,125
Speaker 4:  The, the Trump and tariff stuff feels like part of this too, right? Yeah.

740
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:54,505
Speaker 4:  Like they are, they're actually, this thing has been running very smoothly

741
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:58,425
Speaker 4:  for a very long time. And now Trump is saying, Hey, tariffs

742
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:02,125
Speaker 4:  on everything. And so Apple is scrambling to move things around.

743
00:46:02,545 --> 00:46:05,645
Speaker 4:  Supply chain is actually more important than ever.

744
00:46:06,635 --> 00:46:10,605
Speaker 4:  There's a lot of work to do. If you're Jeff Williams, eh, maybe

745
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:11,165
Speaker 4:  this is a good time.

746
00:46:11,545 --> 00:46:11,765
Speaker 6:  It

747
00:46:11,765 --> 00:46:12,525
Speaker 4:  Was a good, you

748
00:46:12,525 --> 00:46:15,885
Speaker 6:  Know, it's like a cat and mouse game, right? Because they're like, ah, tariff

749
00:46:15,885 --> 00:46:19,245
Speaker 6:  on new country and apple's like, haha, we moved to this other country. And

750
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:23,165
Speaker 6:  then they'll go, ah ha tear on that country. And apple's like, haha, we'll

751
00:46:23,165 --> 00:46:25,765
Speaker 6:  move to this other country. Or like, that's what it seems. They'll find a

752
00:46:25,765 --> 00:46:28,005
Speaker 6:  way like it's been happen. They'll find a way. And so they need, they need

753
00:46:28,005 --> 00:46:31,645
Speaker 6:  a supply chain guy to know what country to move the factory to. So they love

754
00:46:31,685 --> 00:46:33,445
Speaker 6:  a supply chain guy. Yeah. They love a supply

755
00:46:33,445 --> 00:46:35,845
Speaker 4:  Chain guy. Yeah. Okay. They, they do love a supply chain guy, which, which

756
00:46:35,845 --> 00:46:39,525
Speaker 4:  I think is interesting because, you know, the, the going rumors

757
00:46:40,025 --> 00:46:43,925
Speaker 4:  of who, who might succeed cook again like some

758
00:46:43,925 --> 00:46:47,645
Speaker 4:  years out whenever this happens, I believe it's, it's Mark Germond at

759
00:46:47,645 --> 00:46:51,605
Speaker 4:  Bloomberg says that John Turn, who's their hardware

760
00:46:51,665 --> 00:46:55,365
Speaker 4:  guy, is the leading contender right now.

761
00:46:55,935 --> 00:46:59,925
Speaker 4:  Which is very interesting, right? That, that feels to me

762
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:03,765
Speaker 4:  like there's potentially a very different shift in a world where he's

763
00:47:03,765 --> 00:47:07,565
Speaker 4:  leading it because Tim Cook, at least like my read on it, is that he is not

764
00:47:07,685 --> 00:47:11,605
Speaker 4:  a product guy in the way that jobs was and probably not a product guy in

765
00:47:11,605 --> 00:47:12,525
Speaker 4:  the way that turn is.

766
00:47:12,965 --> 00:47:16,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And arguably that's what Apple needs too, because

767
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:20,485
Speaker 6:  we're at a point where, I think I was talking about this with Todd, our reviews

768
00:47:20,485 --> 00:47:23,645
Speaker 6:  editor, WD editor where the iPhone is

769
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:28,125
Speaker 6:  like, what, 17 years old? There are people who can vote and fight

770
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:32,005
Speaker 6:  for our country who don't remember a world without iPhones. So it's like

771
00:47:32,185 --> 00:47:35,525
Speaker 6:  not a new product or technology anymore.

772
00:47:36,225 --> 00:47:40,005
Speaker 6:  So I think, you know, with the AI hype, everybody's looking to what's next.

773
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:44,205
Speaker 6:  Maybe you want a hardware guy in there who can really shape what

774
00:47:44,205 --> 00:47:48,045
Speaker 6:  the next vision of that's gonna be. So maybe if you think about

775
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:51,925
Speaker 6:  vision versus maintenance, maybe it's like a thought process

776
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:55,725
Speaker 6:  with Turn is going back from maintenance to vision again and doing

777
00:47:56,145 --> 00:48:00,045
Speaker 6:  the stuff that made Apple splashy to begin with. Who knows, I'm not a,

778
00:48:00,145 --> 00:48:03,645
Speaker 6:  I'm not a business forecaster. I don't have like a crystal ball, but I think

779
00:48:03,645 --> 00:48:06,165
Speaker 6:  that's maybe something that TUR has. Yeah.

780
00:48:07,025 --> 00:48:10,725
Speaker 5:  And the didn't they change, like the design team now

781
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:14,605
Speaker 5:  reports directly to Tim Cook too. Yeah. So I don't know

782
00:48:14,605 --> 00:48:18,445
Speaker 5:  if if those things are related, but it would make it kind of sense to have

783
00:48:18,445 --> 00:48:19,405
Speaker 5:  like, I don't know,

784
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:22,445
Speaker 6:  Like Tim Cook is also surprisingly into sneakers.

785
00:48:23,505 --> 00:48:25,325
Speaker 6:  So like, you know,

786
00:48:25,745 --> 00:48:28,765
Speaker 4:  Tim Cook is a hype beast. Is this where we're we're headed? Oh my God, he's

787
00:48:28,765 --> 00:48:29,965
Speaker 4:  full, he's a hype. He's

788
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:30,245
Speaker 6:  Full and

789
00:48:30,245 --> 00:48:31,205
Speaker 4:  He has like, oh my god,

790
00:48:31,455 --> 00:48:35,445
Speaker 6:  Stone designer like sneakers, a couple of conferences back and like, it was

791
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:38,685
Speaker 6:  in the Hype Beast article about how he had these like special, I, I believe

792
00:48:38,685 --> 00:48:42,365
Speaker 6:  it was Mikey. And so I, you know, on the face of it,

793
00:48:42,465 --> 00:48:44,845
Speaker 6:  Tim Cook ha has his uniform. You wouldn't

794
00:48:45,435 --> 00:48:45,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

795
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:49,525
Speaker 6:  Keeg him as like the design guy. But he, he's into sneakers

796
00:48:49,905 --> 00:48:50,565
Speaker 6:  and he swol

797
00:48:50,565 --> 00:48:53,085
Speaker 5:  So maybe they're, yeah, maybe they're making some sneakers.

798
00:48:53,215 --> 00:48:55,845
Speaker 6:  Maybe there's multitudes to cook that we haven't, like Tim

799
00:48:55,845 --> 00:48:59,685
Speaker 4:  Cook, Tim Cook is gonna retire from Apple Takeover

800
00:48:59,715 --> 00:49:03,445
Speaker 4:  Supreme. Yeah. And have a have a like whole second

801
00:49:03,785 --> 00:49:05,405
Speaker 4:  career after this. I love

802
00:49:05,405 --> 00:49:09,245
Speaker 6:  It. I I believe it. You're you're hearing it now, Tim, you have,

803
00:49:09,245 --> 00:49:10,805
Speaker 4:  You do a hard pivot. Yeah, yeah,

804
00:49:10,805 --> 00:49:14,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah. He's gonna be, he's just gonna be on the board of Gentle Monster,

805
00:49:15,095 --> 00:49:18,045
Speaker 6:  which that's sunglass company from Korea with like the really interesting

806
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,045
Speaker 6:  silhouettes. He's just gonna, he's gonna be a fashion icon.

807
00:49:21,165 --> 00:49:24,925
Speaker 4:  I I would love this, I love this, love this. I really want, like Cook is

808
00:49:24,925 --> 00:49:28,765
Speaker 4:  the driest executive, like in public and if

809
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,845
Speaker 4:  like, you know, steps out and is like, I'm gonna live a different life now.

810
00:49:32,005 --> 00:49:32,125
Speaker 4:  I

811
00:49:32,325 --> 00:49:33,725
Speaker 6:  I, oh, there's like a quiet,

812
00:49:33,795 --> 00:49:34,325
Speaker 4:  He's earned it.

813
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:36,685
Speaker 6:  A quiet fired Tim Cook. This is my fantasy

814
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:38,885
Speaker 5:  Quiet fire.

815
00:49:40,065 --> 00:49:40,285
Speaker 6:  My

816
00:49:40,285 --> 00:49:44,205
Speaker 4:  Gosh. So the next big piece of corporate changeup happened

817
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,925
Speaker 4:  last week while we were off, which is that Mark Zuckerberg finally

818
00:49:47,925 --> 00:49:51,565
Speaker 4:  announced his big AI superintelligence

819
00:49:51,575 --> 00:49:55,285
Speaker 4:  group. This is like, it is a super group of AI

820
00:49:55,565 --> 00:49:59,525
Speaker 4:  researchers, which I wanna, may I think, I think sounds cool

821
00:49:59,525 --> 00:50:00,485
Speaker 4:  when you put it that way.

822
00:50:00,755 --> 00:50:04,645
Speaker 6:  Does it, it also could sound like, yeah, the AI Avengers,

823
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:05,725
Speaker 6:  but it is,

824
00:50:05,755 --> 00:50:06,885
Speaker 4:  It's the AI of he should

825
00:50:06,885 --> 00:50:08,285
Speaker 5:  Have Oh no, that's terrifying.

826
00:50:09,145 --> 00:50:10,205
Speaker 6:  AI Avengers, the AI

827
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:13,005
Speaker 4:  Avengers and famously when the Avengers created ai, it went well, right?

828
00:50:13,785 --> 00:50:17,765
Speaker 6:  Oh, there it's not, that's not totally the plot of Ultron. That's not

829
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:21,845
Speaker 6:  Hmm. You know, famed beloved, critically acclaimed

830
00:50:22,485 --> 00:50:26,205
Speaker 6:  Avengers movie Ultron that everyone loved. I didn't know that.

831
00:50:26,205 --> 00:50:28,365
Speaker 6:  That they didn't, they didn't. They they hate that movie.

832
00:50:29,085 --> 00:50:29,205
Speaker 4:  I

833
00:50:29,205 --> 00:50:32,125
Speaker 6:  Didn't know that was a movie. You know what, that's, that's the correct,

834
00:50:32,445 --> 00:50:36,285
Speaker 4:  It's it's all right. It's all right. They made a, yeah, so

835
00:50:36,795 --> 00:50:40,765
Speaker 4:  this is, this is weird. This is a little wild. Like Zuck is sort

836
00:50:40,765 --> 00:50:44,525
Speaker 4:  of just like power tripping here. And first he

837
00:50:44,525 --> 00:50:48,325
Speaker 4:  paid $14 billion to buy half

838
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:52,365
Speaker 4:  of scale ai, which is mostly, it appears that he can

839
00:50:52,365 --> 00:50:55,125
Speaker 4:  hire their CEO, Alexander Wang

840
00:50:57,155 --> 00:51:00,565
Speaker 4:  Wang is becoming meta's chief AI officer. Sure.

841
00:51:00,945 --> 00:51:04,645
Speaker 4:  And then he's just paying out hundreds of millions of dollars

842
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,725
Speaker 4:  to individual researchers. He's just going around to every

843
00:51:08,945 --> 00:51:12,365
Speaker 4:  AI lab, OpenAI, Google Anthropic, and

844
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:16,845
Speaker 4:  giving people these incredible offers that, that just

845
00:51:16,845 --> 00:51:20,285
Speaker 4:  like bogle the mind that you would pay somebody this much to convince them

846
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:23,085
Speaker 4:  to come over, which tells you two things. Number one,

847
00:51:24,225 --> 00:51:27,165
Speaker 4:  it is hard to convince people to come work at Meta, right? Yeah, yeah. Like

848
00:51:27,165 --> 00:51:31,045
Speaker 4:  that is Hayden Field. Our AI reporter just ran a story where

849
00:51:31,105 --> 00:51:34,405
Speaker 4:  she talked to some people who got some of these offers and the thing they

850
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:38,325
Speaker 4:  told her was, yeah, we care about the

851
00:51:38,325 --> 00:51:42,245
Speaker 4:  mission, which is why we're staying at, you know, the ones who

852
00:51:42,515 --> 00:51:46,485
Speaker 4:  turn this down don't want to go to Meta and have to do whatever they

853
00:51:46,485 --> 00:51:47,605
Speaker 4:  want us to do. Oh

854
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:47,845
Speaker 6:  Boy.

855
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:51,245
Speaker 4:  Oh, you know, you're, they're gonna get paid. Okay. Anywhere.

856
00:51:52,745 --> 00:51:56,505
Speaker 4:  But I Zuck is just spending boatloads of

857
00:51:56,505 --> 00:52:00,225
Speaker 4:  cash to build this, you know, huge team of

858
00:52:00,275 --> 00:52:03,865
Speaker 4:  super capable researchers, right? He's got the, the former CEO of GitHub,

859
00:52:04,215 --> 00:52:07,825
Speaker 4:  he's got a, a co-founder and the former CEO of Safe

860
00:52:08,285 --> 00:52:11,905
Speaker 4:  superintelligence. He got people from Anthropic, from Sesame.

861
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:15,985
Speaker 4:  It's, it's all over the place. And these dollar figures are

862
00:52:16,215 --> 00:52:20,025
Speaker 4:  mind-boggling. And what's really interesting is like, okay, okay,

863
00:52:20,385 --> 00:52:24,225
Speaker 4:  I get it. So you now have one of the most capable AI leadership

864
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,305
Speaker 4:  teams in the, in the world.

865
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:30,815
Speaker 4:  The idea is you'll go and build some sort of fancy AI

866
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:34,095
Speaker 4:  thing, superintelligence, whatever you wanna call it with that. But, but

867
00:52:34,095 --> 00:52:37,955
Speaker 4:  there is sort of a question, right? Like the technology exists,

868
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:42,035
Speaker 4:  or much of it does, people are building it. Is it these specific people?

869
00:52:42,855 --> 00:52:46,555
Speaker 4:  Or, or like, are they, do you just buy the people and therefore you get the

870
00:52:46,555 --> 00:52:47,075
Speaker 4:  good ai?

871
00:52:48,315 --> 00:52:52,275
Speaker 6:  I mean, that's obviously what his, his strategy is. He's

872
00:52:52,275 --> 00:52:55,755
Speaker 6:  just throwing money around. He's just like, I've got money. Come work for

873
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:59,675
Speaker 6:  me, do the thing. And I think he's getting thrifted on some level

874
00:52:59,825 --> 00:53:03,675
Speaker 6:  because I no hate to any of these people getting these,

875
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:07,715
Speaker 6:  what, $300 million over four year packages? Like, get the

876
00:53:07,715 --> 00:53:11,555
Speaker 6:  bag. I love that for you. Yeah, this is your time, but

877
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:14,395
Speaker 6:  at the same time, you look at that cost and it's just like,

878
00:53:15,855 --> 00:53:19,795
Speaker 6:  are you getting your money's worth? How, how much did you spend on that metaverse

879
00:53:20,175 --> 00:53:21,275
Speaker 6:  gambit bud?

880
00:53:21,835 --> 00:53:24,715
Speaker 4:  I mean, this is what I'm thinking about, right? Where it's like, okay, let's

881
00:53:24,715 --> 00:53:28,645
Speaker 4:  think, let's think about the last time Zuck sort of like went ham and

882
00:53:28,855 --> 00:53:31,725
Speaker 4:  spent a ton of money on some initiative that we were like, I don't know if

883
00:53:31,725 --> 00:53:33,605
Speaker 4:  This's gonna work out for you. It is the Metaverse.

884
00:53:33,995 --> 00:53:37,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There, there's still no legs in the Metaverse. So where did

885
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,085
Speaker 6:  all that money go? I didn't

886
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:39,805
Speaker 5:  Announce the legs.

887
00:53:40,355 --> 00:53:42,765
Speaker 6:  They announced the legs, but did the legs ever come?

888
00:53:42,945 --> 00:53:44,285
Speaker 5:  The legs never shipped. It's a

889
00:53:44,385 --> 00:53:46,605
Speaker 4:  Can. I never can I tell saying nobody signed on to check.

890
00:53:47,935 --> 00:53:48,805
Speaker 5:  There could be legs.

891
00:53:48,955 --> 00:53:52,885
Speaker 4:  Like that's, you know, he made the wrong, but, but also,

892
00:53:53,035 --> 00:53:55,605
Speaker 4:  it's not even that he made the wrong bet at the wrong time. Like that, that,

893
00:53:55,825 --> 00:53:59,565
Speaker 4:  you know, I feel like you could have easily foreseen that. Yeah. When talking

894
00:53:59,565 --> 00:54:03,525
Speaker 4:  about the metaverse, it's that he put in a boatload of money and it was

895
00:54:03,705 --> 00:54:03,925
Speaker 4:  bad.

896
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:05,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah.

897
00:54:05,185 --> 00:54:08,765
Speaker 4:  And like, they're kind of doing that with, with Llama already.

898
00:54:09,065 --> 00:54:12,805
Speaker 4:  And this feels like number one, it's funny, they've, they've for for

899
00:54:12,805 --> 00:54:16,605
Speaker 4:  months been talking of Llama how great it is. There was that scandal

900
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:20,445
Speaker 4:  a few months back where they ran a special, like,

901
00:54:20,595 --> 00:54:24,485
Speaker 4:  optimized version of Lama to like game some tests. Oh yeah. Right.

902
00:54:24,945 --> 00:54:26,565
Speaker 4:  If you've used Meta ai,

903
00:54:26,775 --> 00:54:27,485
Speaker 6:  Which I have,

904
00:54:28,105 --> 00:54:28,965
Speaker 4:  How is it v

905
00:54:29,305 --> 00:54:33,205
Speaker 6:  Not great. I mean, on the one hand, so I mostly use Meta AI through the

906
00:54:33,205 --> 00:54:36,845
Speaker 6:  glasses when I'm testing new features or whatnot. My favorite thing about

907
00:54:36,845 --> 00:54:39,245
Speaker 6:  it is that I can make it sound like John Cena.

908
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:41,205
Speaker 4:  Oh no, it's not bad. It's not

909
00:54:41,205 --> 00:54:45,165
Speaker 6:  Bad. Yeah. Yeah. But that's my favorite thing about it. Yeah. Yeah. So

910
00:54:45,755 --> 00:54:49,725
Speaker 6:  like, I've tried the live ai, which has its pros and cons. I

911
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:53,485
Speaker 6:  think the multimodal thing is really smart. But the

912
00:54:54,355 --> 00:54:57,915
Speaker 6:  live translations, for example, that, that was

913
00:54:58,255 --> 00:55:02,195
Speaker 6:  not, I tried, sorry Allison, I have to talk

914
00:55:02,195 --> 00:55:05,715
Speaker 6:  about Amelia Perez again. Oh, it's my favorite.

915
00:55:06,435 --> 00:55:10,195
Speaker 6:  I tried months back, just like seeing like, oh, could I use this to

916
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:13,995
Speaker 6:  translate content that I'm watching? So I put on a clip of one of the terrible

917
00:55:13,995 --> 00:55:17,595
Speaker 6:  songs and Emelia Perez, and it got some of it, and then others

918
00:55:17,775 --> 00:55:21,475
Speaker 6:  bit, it was just, so it was John Cena just saying very

919
00:55:21,475 --> 00:55:24,595
Speaker 6:  wrong things. Oh, no. About the Spanish. So

920
00:55:25,185 --> 00:55:27,595
Speaker 6:  yeah, in my experience, not great.

921
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:31,835
Speaker 5:  It, it sort of feels like there's a, a moment coming. I don't know if it's

922
00:55:31,835 --> 00:55:35,035
Speaker 5:  like the chips are down or it's like,

923
00:55:35,775 --> 00:55:38,435
Speaker 5:  what's the game where you have to get a chair? Do you have

924
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:39,355
Speaker 6:  To like mu musical chairs,

925
00:55:39,355 --> 00:55:43,115
Speaker 5:  Musical chairs. It's like musical chairs. And everybody's like, okay,

926
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:46,795
Speaker 5:  it's about time to figure out this AI stuff. Yeah. Like Apple, they're like,

927
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:51,075
Speaker 5:  can we build it or should we just buy a company? And there's a little

928
00:55:51,075 --> 00:55:54,715
Speaker 5:  bit of that going on, and Zuck is like, I'm buying all these chairs.

929
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:56,555
Speaker 5:  I'm covering all my bases.

930
00:55:56,855 --> 00:56:00,395
Speaker 6:  So I spent all the stuff on the Metaverse, and apparently that's not what

931
00:56:00,395 --> 00:56:04,355
Speaker 6:  people want. So I didn't spend everything on ai. So money,

932
00:56:04,905 --> 00:56:07,675
Speaker 6:  here you go. But that's, that's what this feels like. There you go.

933
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:11,435
Speaker 4:  Thinking about the Ray bands is really interesting too, because there,

934
00:56:11,685 --> 00:56:15,435
Speaker 4:  right now it's like, it's this very simple product and we're like, Hey, these

935
00:56:15,435 --> 00:56:19,035
Speaker 4:  are nice headphones. And they are really bullish on

936
00:56:19,795 --> 00:56:21,355
Speaker 4:  actually their AI glasses.

937
00:56:21,535 --> 00:56:21,875
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah.

938
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:25,485
Speaker 4:  They, and it's, is it Right? Like they, in fact, they have to build the

939
00:56:25,705 --> 00:56:25,925
Speaker 4:  ai,

940
00:56:26,475 --> 00:56:30,285
Speaker 6:  They do in fact have to build the ai. So, you know, there are communities

941
00:56:30,285 --> 00:56:34,005
Speaker 6:  that really do love the Meta glasses

942
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:38,205
Speaker 6:  and the AI in them. Spoiler alert, that's what my next host episode

943
00:56:38,705 --> 00:56:42,605
Speaker 6:  on Tuesday is gonna be about. But you know, by and

944
00:56:42,605 --> 00:56:46,255
Speaker 6:  large, most people are not really thinking of it

945
00:56:46,435 --> 00:56:50,215
Speaker 6:  in that way. But I do, every single time I write them as smart glasses.

946
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:54,255
Speaker 6:  I, I'm, I've got a good relationship with the PR people at Meta, but they're

947
00:56:54,255 --> 00:56:57,775
Speaker 6:  like, would you be open to calling it AI glasses? And it's like,

948
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:03,015
Speaker 6:  no, they're smart glasses. But so to to, to, like,

949
00:57:03,015 --> 00:57:06,095
Speaker 6:  the reason I tell that story is to say that like, they are super bullish

950
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:10,455
Speaker 6:  on glasses being a vehicle for ai. They really believe that

951
00:57:10,455 --> 00:57:14,135
Speaker 6:  glasses are like, what are gonna get people thinking about ai? And you know,

952
00:57:14,135 --> 00:57:17,055
Speaker 6:  Google's kind of jumped on that train too with Android xr. So

953
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:20,295
Speaker 6:  they still gotta build the AI first. So

954
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:22,615
Speaker 6:  we'll see.

955
00:57:23,025 --> 00:57:26,855
Speaker 4:  We'll see. Yeah. It's, it is, it is not a bet in a vacuum. It's, and it's

956
00:57:26,855 --> 00:57:30,655
Speaker 4:  like so easy to think of it that way. I think particularly because like OpenAI,

957
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:33,855
Speaker 4:  like it is, it exists as a website. Like it is, it is a bot on its own.

958
00:57:34,395 --> 00:57:38,255
Speaker 4:  That's it. And Meta is trying to

959
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:42,135
Speaker 4:  productize it. Yeah. And the product is okay and the AI is

960
00:57:42,135 --> 00:57:42,535
Speaker 4:  not Okay.

961
00:57:44,655 --> 00:57:48,305
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I thi this is going to be, I think just one of the clear,

962
00:57:48,455 --> 00:57:52,265
Speaker 4:  like give this a couple years obviously, but it is going to be

963
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:56,225
Speaker 4:  a fascinating experiment to see if you can just buy your

964
00:57:56,225 --> 00:58:00,105
Speaker 4:  way to a, a great product. 'cause I cannot remember, obviously people

965
00:58:00,105 --> 00:58:04,035
Speaker 4:  will just buy companies. I mean, it's funny. Yeah, actually a lot

966
00:58:04,035 --> 00:58:07,355
Speaker 4:  of the big company acquisitions do not work. No, they don't. There is a culture

967
00:58:07,405 --> 00:58:11,195
Speaker 4:  clash, right? I'm thinking of like Google buying Motorola,

968
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:15,235
Speaker 4:  which like, and then selling it a few years later,

969
00:58:16,525 --> 00:58:20,475
Speaker 4:  right? So this is sort of a version of that. He is just buying what

970
00:58:20,475 --> 00:58:23,195
Speaker 4:  he thinks is all the best people and who by all, by all accounts are supposed

971
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:26,995
Speaker 4:  to be, be incredibly talented researchers. Can you buy your way

972
00:58:27,415 --> 00:58:31,075
Speaker 4:  to the best product? We're gonna find out. And it's gonna be really interesting

973
00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:33,715
Speaker 4:  to see. And if it does not pay off, like

974
00:58:35,685 --> 00:58:38,895
Speaker 6:  Yeah. At least this is a better bet, I think than the metaverse.

975
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:42,855
Speaker 4:  It it, yes. I think that is, that is fair, right? Like there is a product

976
00:58:43,075 --> 00:58:47,015
Speaker 4:  to be had here that people want some doesn't. That some people

977
00:58:47,015 --> 00:58:50,935
Speaker 4:  want. Some people the question is, can, can they build something? Llamas

978
00:58:51,115 --> 00:58:52,655
Speaker 4:  is aggressively fine.

979
00:58:53,285 --> 00:58:55,855
Speaker 6:  It's, that's, I think that's the best way to describe it. 'cause I've been

980
00:58:55,855 --> 00:58:59,775
Speaker 6:  using a bunch of them and it, is it the best one? No. Is it the worst one

981
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:04,305
Speaker 6:  also? No. Yeah. It's safely fine. Yeah.

982
00:59:04,335 --> 00:59:05,905
Speaker 4:  Safe. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

983
00:59:07,505 --> 00:59:10,465
Speaker 4:  Speaking of ai, that is not the best. Oh

984
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:11,185
Speaker 6:  God. Oh

985
00:59:11,185 --> 00:59:14,825
Speaker 4:  My, the other big change this week happened

986
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:18,665
Speaker 4:  at x where there was also some grok news

987
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:23,125
Speaker 4:  to discuss. So ex CEO Linda Ya

988
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:27,045
Speaker 4:  Carino announced this week that she was stepping down. Elon

989
00:59:27,045 --> 00:59:30,645
Speaker 4:  replied with a a, I'm gonna say terse tweet

990
00:59:30,665 --> 00:59:32,885
Speaker 4:  saying thanks for your contributions.

991
00:59:32,985 --> 00:59:33,925
Speaker 6:  Who could have seen this coming?

992
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:36,845
Speaker 4:  When Linda posted about her announcement, she was like, you know, look at

993
00:59:36,845 --> 00:59:40,765
Speaker 4:  all that we've done. We've done such a great job. You know, we made it the

994
00:59:40,765 --> 00:59:44,565
Speaker 4:  everything app. We've like cracked down on safety. We've, we've done free

995
00:59:44,565 --> 00:59:48,445
Speaker 4:  speech. And j Peters on our team just looked at all these things and

996
00:59:48,445 --> 00:59:52,245
Speaker 4:  he is like, actually, like under Ja Carino, none of this stuff has happened.

997
00:59:52,645 --> 00:59:56,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I remember using the X

998
00:59:56,425 --> 01:00:00,165
Speaker 5:  app as an everything app. You know, just yesterday I ordered

999
01:00:00,405 --> 01:00:03,005
Speaker 5:  a pizza. I, no, that's not

1000
01:00:03,005 --> 01:00:06,605
Speaker 6:  True. No, she lasted longer than I thought she would though. 'cause I thought

1001
01:00:06,605 --> 01:00:09,845
Speaker 6:  like when she was announced that I was like, oh, this'll be over in six months

1002
01:00:09,945 --> 01:00:13,765
Speaker 6:  and she lasted four times that. Yeah. So, you know, that's true. Y

1003
01:00:13,955 --> 01:00:17,925
Speaker 6:  yeah. I'm, I might just might be me, but I don't know if I could have

1004
01:00:18,305 --> 01:00:20,085
Speaker 6:  lasted as long as she did. Yeah.

1005
01:00:20,135 --> 01:00:20,485
Speaker 5:  Given

1006
01:00:20,505 --> 01:00:21,885
Speaker 6:  So we circumstances. So

1007
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,165
Speaker 5:  We think she just got fed up.

1008
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:25,325
Speaker 6:  Right. I, I think she just was like, that's

1009
01:00:25,325 --> 01:00:25,725
Speaker 5:  The thinking.

1010
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:28,285
Speaker 6:  I think she was just like, yeah, I didn't sign up for this.

1011
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:31,805
Speaker 4:  See, I, I don't, it takes a certain type of person to

1012
01:00:32,475 --> 01:00:36,325
Speaker 4:  volunteer to work for Elon. And she was pretty gung ho about it up

1013
01:00:36,325 --> 01:00:37,005
Speaker 4:  front. Yeah. Oh

1014
01:00:37,005 --> 01:00:38,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. She was, she

1015
01:00:38,965 --> 01:00:42,685
Speaker 4:  Was. And so that, so I, I don't know. I'm very, very

1016
01:00:42,685 --> 01:00:44,365
Speaker 4:  interested in finding out what happened there.

1017
01:00:44,685 --> 01:00:48,645
Speaker 6:  Do you think she knew about the whole like trumpet turn that he was gonna

1018
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,485
Speaker 6:  do Doge and all of that? Do you think she just finally went like,

1019
01:00:52,965 --> 01:00:56,565
Speaker 6:  I signed up for, like, I signed up for stuff. I didn't sign up for that.

1020
01:00:56,835 --> 01:01:00,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And she's just finally been like, okay, and I'm

1021
01:01:00,685 --> 01:01:00,845
Speaker 6:  done.

1022
01:01:01,715 --> 01:01:05,365
Speaker 4:  It's, it's, I mean, she spent a lot of her time.

1023
01:01:05,645 --> 01:01:09,125
Speaker 4:  I think so, right? Because she spent a lot of her time defending him. And

1024
01:01:09,185 --> 01:01:12,925
Speaker 4:  her job when she came on was, advertisers are

1025
01:01:12,925 --> 01:01:16,765
Speaker 4:  fleeing this platform because everyone hates Elon and he keeps saying

1026
01:01:16,765 --> 01:01:20,565
Speaker 4:  inappropriate stuff. Right? Yeah. And so, you know,

1027
01:01:20,985 --> 01:01:24,945
Speaker 4:  and she, you know, didn't quite get

1028
01:01:24,945 --> 01:01:27,345
Speaker 4:  that. Like there are some adv, the the platform still exists.

1029
01:01:28,295 --> 01:01:28,745
Speaker 6:  It's there.

1030
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:32,505
Speaker 4:  But the other thing is that when she signed on X was an independent company,

1031
01:01:32,685 --> 01:01:36,225
Speaker 4:  it is now owned by XAI, which means there are even,

1032
01:01:36,685 --> 01:01:39,625
Speaker 4:  you know, she was always the CEO and it always felt like it was in air quotes.

1033
01:01:39,695 --> 01:01:42,265
Speaker 4:  Like, Elon owns a place, Elon runs the place

1034
01:01:44,005 --> 01:01:47,325
Speaker 4:  X also announced a, a new head of product recently. They put

1035
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:51,965
Speaker 4:  Nikita beer in charge. He was the co-founder of TBH, which

1036
01:01:52,185 --> 01:01:56,045
Speaker 4:  Metabo And I believe then shut down. And also Gas, which was acquired by

1037
01:01:56,075 --> 01:01:59,965
Speaker 4:  Discord. I have, I, the apps as I'm told, I believe are

1038
01:01:59,965 --> 01:02:03,365
Speaker 4:  for teens. And so I did not use them. I

1039
01:02:03,365 --> 01:02:06,725
Speaker 6:  Don't, you know what, that's just being age appropriate. And on the teen

1040
01:02:06,725 --> 01:02:07,325
Speaker 6:  apps, teens

1041
01:02:07,325 --> 01:02:08,165
Speaker 5:  Are using gas.

1042
01:02:08,755 --> 01:02:09,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1043
01:02:11,265 --> 01:02:14,805
Speaker 4:  I'm not sure about that. These are words. I can't prove that words.

1044
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:19,605
Speaker 4:  So X you know, it's got some, it's got some, they didn't announce a new CEO.

1045
01:02:19,605 --> 01:02:22,605
Speaker 4:  They didn't, they didn't say anything. They're just like, Linda's gone. Okay.

1046
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:26,085
Speaker 4:  And, and then in the background of all of this

1047
01:02:27,675 --> 01:02:31,645
Speaker 4:  grok, I I, I kind of, there's something

1048
01:02:31,695 --> 01:02:35,645
Speaker 4:  about X as a platform right now where it

1049
01:02:35,645 --> 01:02:39,245
Speaker 4:  just, there's sometimes there are rainy days and thunderstorms

1050
01:02:39,745 --> 01:02:43,725
Speaker 4:  and you're just like, oh yeah, the chat bot that lives in the platform

1051
01:02:43,725 --> 01:02:47,285
Speaker 4:  is being racist and calling itself Mecca Hitler today. And you're like, well,

1052
01:02:47,285 --> 01:02:50,685
Speaker 4:  where does it like, oh, it does that sometimes. And it's like that, this

1053
01:02:50,685 --> 01:02:54,365
Speaker 4:  is the point we have gotten to with X, where we're like, number one,

1054
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:58,565
Speaker 4:  it's still, it still functions number two. Yeah. You can just ignore

1055
01:02:58,575 --> 01:03:02,005
Speaker 4:  Mecca Hitler, like, yeah. Oh yeah. They, they'll deal with it. It's fine.

1056
01:03:02,005 --> 01:03:04,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Mecca Hitler, that's the, do you remember when we used to call, like

1057
01:03:04,635 --> 01:03:08,125
Speaker 6:  back when it was Twitter, we used to be like, this is the main character

1058
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:12,045
Speaker 6:  of the day. Yes. And now gr is the main character of the day as Mecca

1059
01:03:12,045 --> 01:03:14,645
Speaker 6:  Hitler. But don't love that.

1060
01:03:15,185 --> 01:03:17,805
Speaker 4:  No, I, it, the, the Mecca Hitler thing is

1061
01:03:18,835 --> 01:03:22,805
Speaker 4:  perhaps the more, the lighter part of it, it, it was being like

1062
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:27,245
Speaker 4:  actively super antisemitic and racist and offensive

1063
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:32,005
Speaker 4:  and just like going off for a couple days and eventually they like shut it

1064
01:03:32,005 --> 01:03:35,885
Speaker 4:  down. This all ends with Elon

1065
01:03:35,885 --> 01:03:39,725
Speaker 4:  hosting a live stream turnout's Rock four, which may or may not

1066
01:03:39,745 --> 01:03:43,005
Speaker 4:  be live at this point. It wasn't unless I checked it's,

1067
01:03:44,085 --> 01:03:47,725
Speaker 4:  I, I don't, I don't really get it. Like x as a product

1068
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:51,845
Speaker 4:  is, I think bewildering to me at this point. Like, I,

1069
01:03:52,005 --> 01:03:55,965
Speaker 4:  I think the grand proclamations of Doom, I

1070
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:59,045
Speaker 4:  guess I would argue did not quite, yeah.

1071
01:03:59,045 --> 01:04:02,405
Speaker 6:  There's like a ton of people who are still on X. Yeah. Surprisingly. The,

1072
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:06,125
Speaker 6:  like the, the 10 seconds I'm on there every so often. I'm like, oh,

1073
01:04:06,215 --> 01:04:10,085
Speaker 6:  right. So, and so I used to follow, they still be posting

1074
01:04:10,185 --> 01:04:13,965
Speaker 6:  up a storm on X. Yeah. So that's, you know, it's still there.

1075
01:04:13,965 --> 01:04:17,725
Speaker 6:  People are still have not left, which is wild

1076
01:04:17,905 --> 01:04:18,805
Speaker 6:  to me, but Yeah.

1077
01:04:18,945 --> 01:04:21,365
Speaker 4:  And like, you know, I don't wanna, I shouldn't give him too much credit for

1078
01:04:21,365 --> 01:04:25,085
Speaker 4:  this, but like, Elon fired most of the company and like, it's still,

1079
01:04:25,325 --> 01:04:29,205
Speaker 4:  you know, the a the website is still online most of the time. Right? Like,

1080
01:04:29,435 --> 01:04:33,415
Speaker 4:  okay, okay, they've got that. Is

1081
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:37,255
Speaker 4:  it succeeding? Not right. The thing it

1082
01:04:37,255 --> 01:04:41,055
Speaker 4:  has succeeded at is creating a whole bunch of competing

1083
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:45,135
Speaker 4:  platforms, including Threads, which there was data out this week that it

1084
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:48,975
Speaker 4:  is like nearly catching up That's wild on mobile app

1085
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,055
Speaker 4:  usage. Wow. Right.

1086
01:04:50,055 --> 01:04:53,695
Speaker 6:  That's absolutely wild. Considering how awful Threads is like, I'm sorry,

1087
01:04:54,365 --> 01:04:58,015
Speaker 6:  like I go to Threads for very specific things, which is K-pop because apparently

1088
01:04:58,415 --> 01:05:01,695
Speaker 6:  my algo there is just like, all you care about is K-pop. And I'm like,

1089
01:05:02,205 --> 01:05:06,105
Speaker 6:  are they wrong? They are only partly wrong. I care about other things, but

1090
01:05:06,245 --> 01:05:10,225
Speaker 6:  I'm just like, that's my entire feed on threads is just K-pop from, but like

1091
01:05:10,275 --> 01:05:13,025
Speaker 6:  K-pop news from five days ago. Oh, so like not.

1092
01:05:13,335 --> 01:05:14,425
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's

1093
01:05:14,425 --> 01:05:16,425
Speaker 6:  What you go to threads for. Something happens. That's what you go to Threads

1094
01:05:16,425 --> 01:05:16,905
Speaker 6:  for five

1095
01:05:16,905 --> 01:05:20,445
Speaker 5:  Days ago, everywhere. I wonder how much of it is Meta just

1096
01:05:20,445 --> 01:05:23,245
Speaker 5:  aggressively pushing people to threads, which has been,

1097
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:25,445
Speaker 6:  Oh, it's so aggressive in Instagram now.

1098
01:05:25,675 --> 01:05:29,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Scrolling through and you're like, oh, do I wanna look at a, a

1099
01:05:29,565 --> 01:05:32,045
Speaker 5:  threads post from three days ago? I think I'm good

1100
01:05:32,235 --> 01:05:36,125
Speaker 4:  Threads also very aggressively pushes the, like for You

1101
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:39,525
Speaker 4:  page or whatever it's called, the Discover page. Whereas, you know,

1102
01:05:40,105 --> 01:05:43,815
Speaker 4:  other platforms are nice and give you options or let you choose your

1103
01:05:44,185 --> 01:05:48,095
Speaker 4:  right. The I go on threads And I get frigging sucked in. 'cause it

1104
01:05:48,095 --> 01:05:51,295
Speaker 4:  is just like showing me all this stuff from people who I don't follow. And

1105
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:54,935
Speaker 4:  it's like, I, this is why Facebook succeeds. Yeah, yeah. Right. I'm not,

1106
01:05:54,995 --> 01:05:58,695
Speaker 4:  I'm not, I'm not actually saying it's bad necessarily, but like Yeah, I see.

1107
01:05:58,895 --> 01:06:02,255
Speaker 4:  I see why it's doing okay and somehow they've got enough stuff.

1108
01:06:02,965 --> 01:06:04,615
Speaker 6:  They don't have a Mecca Hitler though.

1109
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:09,255
Speaker 4:  I, well, you know what Zuck just spent a lot of money on.

1110
01:06:09,575 --> 01:06:09,815
Speaker 4:  Okay.

1111
01:06:10,245 --> 01:06:13,855
Speaker 6:  Okay. We might have a Mecca Hitler down the line, but, oh

1112
01:06:14,395 --> 01:06:14,615
Speaker 6:  eh,

1113
01:06:14,995 --> 01:06:18,175
Speaker 5:  How close are we to Mecca Hitler? That's a new metric for,

1114
01:06:18,835 --> 01:06:20,415
Speaker 5:  oh God. For your ai

1115
01:06:20,675 --> 01:06:22,135
Speaker 6:  That's dystopian. Yeah,

1116
01:06:23,385 --> 01:06:23,735
Speaker 4:  Sorry.

1117
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:24,615
Speaker 6:  And on that happy

1118
01:06:24,615 --> 01:06:28,415
Speaker 4:  Note, on that happy note, it's time for a break. When we get back,

1119
01:06:29,075 --> 01:06:32,175
Speaker 4:  we are rebranding the lightning round. Get ready for it.

1120
01:09:47,595 --> 01:09:48,085
Speaker 11:  Alright,

1121
01:09:48,445 --> 01:09:52,165
Speaker 4:  We're back. So I have a problem. I have a problem with the

1122
01:09:52,165 --> 01:09:55,165
Speaker 4:  lightning round. I don't know if you guys know this. Oh my goodness. But

1123
01:09:55,555 --> 01:09:58,765
Speaker 4:  Neli and David every week they've got the lightning round. They've got a

1124
01:09:58,765 --> 01:10:01,325
Speaker 4:  whole bunch of stories. And the point of the lightning round is you, you

1125
01:10:01,325 --> 01:10:05,245
Speaker 4:  get through all this, it's fast paced lightning round, right? What

1126
01:10:05,245 --> 01:10:06,125
Speaker 4:  happens Goes

1127
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:06,485
Speaker 5:  Long.

1128
01:10:06,515 --> 01:10:09,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah, goes long. They don't get to all the stories. They gotta cut 'em.

1129
01:10:10,235 --> 01:10:14,125
Speaker 4:  That ends today. Okay. We are cha era. The

1130
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:17,545
Speaker 4:  lightning round is done. We are changing it.

1131
01:10:18,045 --> 01:10:20,865
Speaker 4:  It is henceforth known as the thunder round.

1132
01:10:22,925 --> 01:10:23,465
Speaker 5:  Oh my God.

1133
01:10:23,675 --> 01:10:27,625
Speaker 4:  Let's do this. Okay, here's what's gonna happen. Unlike

1134
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:31,425
Speaker 4:  the lightning round, the thunder round gets stuff done, it

1135
01:10:31,425 --> 01:10:34,655
Speaker 4:  keeps moving. We've got 15 stories,

1136
01:10:35,405 --> 01:10:39,335
Speaker 4:  15 minutes, and I have given Eric Gomez

1137
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:42,975
Speaker 4:  our producer, the Power of Lightning. Oh, thunder,

1138
01:10:43,645 --> 01:10:44,935
Speaker 4:  that one's wrong. That's

1139
01:10:44,935 --> 01:10:46,655
Speaker 5:  Wrong. Well, you, you have one, you have the other. Yeah.

1140
01:10:46,685 --> 01:10:50,535
Speaker 4:  Okay. He's got the power of something to make us

1141
01:10:50,965 --> 01:10:54,335
Speaker 4:  move along and he is gonna come in with

1142
01:10:54,725 --> 01:10:58,535
Speaker 4:  some, some rolling, some crackling thunder, some crashes

1143
01:10:58,715 --> 01:11:01,335
Speaker 4:  to keep us moving if we, if we go a little too slow.

1144
01:11:02,095 --> 01:11:05,935
Speaker 5:  I love that. Okay. And I love this. So ready? I'm ready. I'm gonna jump a

1145
01:11:05,935 --> 01:11:06,135
Speaker 5:  million

1146
01:11:06,135 --> 01:11:09,775
Speaker 4:  Times. All right people, let's do this. The first ever

1147
01:11:09,925 --> 01:11:13,765
Speaker 4:  thunder round, we're gonna get through all of them. You ready? I believe

1148
01:11:13,765 --> 01:11:17,325
Speaker 4:  in this. Okay. Story number one. I really wanna talk about this.

1149
01:11:18,085 --> 01:11:22,045
Speaker 4:  Allison, you covered Project Indigo, which is this Adobe

1150
01:11:22,145 --> 01:11:24,525
Speaker 4:  camera app for the iPhone, right?

1151
01:11:24,945 --> 01:11:28,365
Speaker 5:  Yes. It's kind of a beta product. It is a camera app.

1152
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:32,845
Speaker 5:  It's made by Mark LaVoy, who some people may remember as like

1153
01:11:32,845 --> 01:11:36,645
Speaker 5:  the brains behind the Pixel camera. The idea is it's computational

1154
01:11:36,715 --> 01:11:40,405
Speaker 5:  photography, but it doesn't make your photos look like HDR Hell

1155
01:11:41,545 --> 01:11:45,525
Speaker 5:  is how I would say the sales pitch is. And I played with it. It turned

1156
01:11:45,525 --> 01:11:46,605
Speaker 5:  my phone into a,

1157
01:11:49,245 --> 01:11:53,125
Speaker 5:  a, a piece of fire. I don't know, it, it's, it's very beta.

1158
01:11:53,185 --> 01:11:56,525
Speaker 5:  It heats your phone up. Oh my God. Not a great like,

1159
01:11:57,405 --> 01:12:00,445
Speaker 5:  everyday camera amazing photos. Like, loved it so much. The photos

1160
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:04,325
Speaker 6:  In your story were so, like, they had such intense mood and like a

1161
01:12:04,325 --> 01:12:04,525
Speaker 6:  vibe

1162
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:06,445
Speaker 5:  Contrast, like beautiful.

1163
01:12:06,835 --> 01:12:10,245
Speaker 4:  I've liked really this doesn't happen that often. The entire VERGE newsroom

1164
01:12:10,555 --> 01:12:14,325
Speaker 4:  stopped and was like, what? What, what are these photos? Yes, photos from

1165
01:12:14,325 --> 01:12:17,925
Speaker 4:  a phone. Yeah. I have not seen phone photos like this in,

1166
01:12:18,305 --> 01:12:22,165
Speaker 4:  in years. Yeah, it's Mark LaVoy really feels like the guy who,

1167
01:12:22,225 --> 01:12:23,965
Speaker 4:  who Google like getaway. Yeah,

1168
01:12:24,285 --> 01:12:24,485
Speaker 5:  I know.

1169
01:12:24,635 --> 01:12:25,445
Speaker 4:  What did they do here?

1170
01:12:25,745 --> 01:12:29,725
Speaker 5:  And he's like a fellow at Adobe. What a gig. Yeah, you just hang

1171
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:31,445
Speaker 5:  out, make a camera app

1172
01:12:31,445 --> 01:12:35,045
Speaker 4:  Making the camera app we all want. Yeah. So at, was this like, were these

1173
01:12:35,045 --> 01:12:38,445
Speaker 4:  like specially curated the photos that you posted or 'cause like they, they

1174
01:12:38,445 --> 01:12:39,205
Speaker 4:  were in Incred

1175
01:12:41,025 --> 01:12:41,445
Speaker 6:  The Thunder.

1176
01:12:41,915 --> 01:12:45,645
Speaker 4:  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So I, next story,

1177
01:12:45,645 --> 01:12:49,605
Speaker 4:  we're gonna move along here. Ikea announced a lamp with a speaker in it and

1178
01:12:49,605 --> 01:12:53,165
Speaker 4:  it looks cool and it connects to Spotify. The main thing is they drop

1179
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:53,725
Speaker 4:  Sonos.

1180
01:12:53,955 --> 01:12:57,725
Speaker 6:  This is the correct move to drop Sonos. You like this. I like Sonos has

1181
01:12:57,745 --> 01:13:01,685
Speaker 6:  had kind of a, Sonos has had a year that the app

1182
01:13:01,685 --> 01:13:05,485
Speaker 6:  has not been great. And I think, you know, if you think about what most people

1183
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:08,725
Speaker 6:  use, they're using Bluetooth and they're using Spotify. So just go where

1184
01:13:08,725 --> 01:13:12,045
Speaker 6:  their people are, make it cheaper. You don't have to have like a whole licensing

1185
01:13:12,095 --> 01:13:15,645
Speaker 6:  issue with Sonos for this. And Sonos is like,

1186
01:13:16,585 --> 01:13:18,765
Speaker 6:  you know, it's, it's, are they doing great stuff?

1187
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:22,725
Speaker 4:  Sonos and Ikea always felt like a weird pairing to me. Mm. Right. It is the

1188
01:13:22,725 --> 01:13:26,485
Speaker 4:  highest end of, of connected speakers and

1189
01:13:26,505 --> 01:13:29,885
Speaker 4:  the like lowest end of stuff for your home. I mean, I love Ikea. That is

1190
01:13:29,885 --> 01:13:30,525
Speaker 4:  not enough. Oh

1191
01:13:30,525 --> 01:13:33,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And Ikea is more expensive than they used to be. Yeah, yeah.

1192
01:13:34,465 --> 01:13:38,165
Speaker 6:  You know, it's just, no, but that is like a weird dichotomy and like

1193
01:13:38,585 --> 01:13:42,405
Speaker 6:  ikea's foray into the smart home has always been about simplicity and

1194
01:13:42,435 --> 01:13:45,045
Speaker 6:  keeping things affordable. So yeah. Kind of

1195
01:13:46,105 --> 01:13:47,005
Speaker 5:  The speaker's cute.

1196
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:48,525
Speaker 6:  The speaker is cute. Isn

1197
01:13:48,525 --> 01:13:51,925
Speaker 5:  That bad? Or that's not the lamp. There's a lamp.

1198
01:13:52,245 --> 01:13:53,085
Speaker 4:  I would buy a bunch of these.

1199
01:13:53,585 --> 01:13:57,485
Speaker 5:  Wow. Okay. I want some No beds. Okay. I was just shaking out

1200
01:13:57,665 --> 01:14:00,085
Speaker 6:  The thunder. God does not appreciate Speaker Doc.

1201
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:01,525
Speaker 4:  Ve do you wanna take this one?

1202
01:14:01,595 --> 01:14:05,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So Perplexity has launched a comment web

1203
01:14:05,285 --> 01:14:09,165
Speaker 6:  browser, so a web browser for perplexity, which is the

1204
01:14:09,305 --> 01:14:13,205
Speaker 6:  AI search engine, which fashions itself as I always get

1205
01:14:13,445 --> 01:14:17,085
Speaker 6:  confused by the, the pitch for ity over the other ones. But the whole idea

1206
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:20,765
Speaker 6:  is that it's researching things in real time. So you're supposed to be able

1207
01:14:20,765 --> 01:14:23,805
Speaker 6:  to trust the results more. Sure. It has a web browser now.

1208
01:14:24,555 --> 01:14:25,605
Speaker 5:  Love it. Have you

1209
01:14:25,605 --> 01:14:29,445
Speaker 4:  Used, have either of you used either like Gemini and Chrome or Dia yet?

1210
01:14:29,705 --> 01:14:30,125
Speaker 4:  What's,

1211
01:14:30,405 --> 01:14:34,245
Speaker 6:  I haven't used Dia, but I, I'm a, a long time user of Arc and the

1212
01:14:34,445 --> 01:14:38,085
Speaker 6:  original Arc. Yes. Yeah. So like I get the whole AI browser thing.

1213
01:14:38,235 --> 01:14:42,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So my, okay, so AI browser's super hot right now. They also,

1214
01:14:42,225 --> 01:14:45,325
Speaker 4:  OpenAI is supposed to be launching an AI web browser too. My whole thing

1215
01:14:45,325 --> 01:14:49,085
Speaker 4:  is like, they don't work yet, right? Like, I

1216
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:52,965
Speaker 4:  tried Dia and I'm like this, it's just a permanent chat bot tab. Like

1217
01:14:53,025 --> 01:14:56,965
Speaker 4:  why, oh, what am I, I like, I'm like pretty on board with like

1218
01:14:57,075 --> 01:15:01,005
Speaker 4:  chat GPT being useful. But it's like you just, you

1219
01:15:01,005 --> 01:15:04,365
Speaker 4:  just added a tab to my browser. Yeah, I I I get it. They're trying to, they're

1220
01:15:04,365 --> 01:15:07,565
Speaker 4:  trying to beat Google. They're trying to replace it. And to do that you gotta

1221
01:15:07,565 --> 01:15:07,885
Speaker 4:  be the

1222
01:15:07,885 --> 01:15:11,485
Speaker 6:  Default's a different version of AI overviews I feel. Which is,

1223
01:15:11,985 --> 01:15:12,205
Speaker 6:  eh,

1224
01:15:12,395 --> 01:15:13,285
Speaker 5:  It's more aggressive.

1225
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:14,325
Speaker 6:  It's much more aggressive

1226
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:15,325
Speaker 5:  AI mode. Yeah.

1227
01:15:15,525 --> 01:15:19,165
Speaker 6:  I will say like sometimes in the arc browser, when I have like a thing that

1228
01:15:19,165 --> 01:15:21,165
Speaker 6:  I'm looking up and it gives me the summaries, I'm like, oh, it's helpful

1229
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:24,405
Speaker 6:  to have summaries, but now I gotta look it up and make sure it's like Yeah.

1230
01:15:24,685 --> 01:15:25,765
Speaker 5:  Accurate. So you gotta check it's work.

1231
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:27,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's work

1232
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:31,525
Speaker 5:  AI mode is like, what if you could talk to and interact with a page

1233
01:15:31,525 --> 01:15:35,325
Speaker 5:  of search results? I'm like, Hmm, I don't think I've ever wanted that. No,

1234
01:15:35,325 --> 01:15:35,645
Speaker 5:  no, no.

1235
01:15:35,645 --> 01:15:36,405
Speaker 6:  That's what I asked for.

1236
01:15:36,675 --> 01:15:37,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Cool.

1237
01:15:37,865 --> 01:15:38,725
Speaker 6:  The Oh, right, okay.

1238
01:15:38,725 --> 01:15:39,685
Speaker 5:  Okay. Sorry.

1239
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:44,045
Speaker 6:  I, I brain froze. But anyway, so Yeah. Yeah. AI

1240
01:15:44,045 --> 01:15:44,925
Speaker 6:  browsers, they're not,

1241
01:15:45,585 --> 01:15:46,925
Speaker 5:  Not sure We like it. Yeah. Not sure

1242
01:15:46,925 --> 01:15:49,045
Speaker 4:  We like it. Allison. Alright. Ein

1243
01:15:49,475 --> 01:15:53,405
Speaker 5:  Okay. Ein is on a laptop for some reason.

1244
01:15:53,945 --> 01:15:57,405
Speaker 5:  So there's a laptop, but instead of a touchpad, it has

1245
01:15:58,025 --> 01:16:00,965
Speaker 5:  an ein e-reader for AI apps.

1246
01:16:01,365 --> 01:16:03,325
Speaker 6:  I hate this. I I hate everything about

1247
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:07,245
Speaker 4:  This. Thi this felt like they were just trying to find an angle on their

1248
01:16:07,245 --> 01:16:10,965
Speaker 4:  own pro. Like they were like, we could put an a, an e-reader on the touch

1249
01:16:11,065 --> 01:16:14,485
Speaker 4:  on the track pad. Yeah. And they're like, nobody's gonna buy that. What if

1250
01:16:14,485 --> 01:16:18,045
Speaker 4:  we put AI next to it? Yeah. Hate this. I don't, I don't. Why would you wanna

1251
01:16:18,275 --> 01:16:20,045
Speaker 4:  read on your track pad?

1252
01:16:20,185 --> 01:16:20,405
Speaker 5:  No,

1253
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:23,925
Speaker 6:  I don't. There's no, there's no reason for that. And then also just,

1254
01:16:24,435 --> 01:16:27,485
Speaker 6:  okay, I'm sorry. I'm gonna quote Ron Swanson from Parks and Rec.

1255
01:16:28,135 --> 01:16:32,125
Speaker 6:  Whole ass one thing, don't half ass two things. This

1256
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:35,965
Speaker 6:  is two half ass thing. I have an e-reader, I have

1257
01:16:36,045 --> 01:16:39,445
Speaker 6:  a laptop touch pad and AI is in everything,

1258
01:16:39,905 --> 01:16:43,765
Speaker 6:  but I don't want to read on my touch pad where my FIEs

1259
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:44,965
Speaker 6:  go. So

1260
01:16:45,105 --> 01:16:46,285
Speaker 5:  That's my, because sometimes you're,

1261
01:16:46,865 --> 01:16:48,405
Speaker 6:  You sometimes you're eating and

1262
01:16:48,405 --> 01:16:49,445
Speaker 5:  Then you're gonna get it all smmi

1263
01:16:49,585 --> 01:16:52,965
Speaker 6:  And then it's gonna be on your a IE reader. Yeah. In the middle. Just

1264
01:16:52,965 --> 01:16:53,765
Speaker 5:  Get a folding phone.

1265
01:16:53,955 --> 01:16:55,605
Speaker 6:  Just, I don't know about that.

1266
01:16:55,605 --> 01:16:57,085
Speaker 5:  Then you have a bunch of screens. I don't

1267
01:16:57,085 --> 01:16:58,405
Speaker 6:  Know if I'm gonna go that far, but Yeah.

1268
01:16:58,945 --> 01:17:00,885
Speaker 5:  Get a $2,000 folding whole

1269
01:17:01,065 --> 01:17:04,005
Speaker 6:  Ass one touch pad. That's, that's my spiel. There you

1270
01:17:04,005 --> 01:17:07,965
Speaker 4:  Go. I support that. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Next thing.

1271
01:17:08,185 --> 01:17:11,605
Speaker 4:  Did you guys see, or can I say, did you not see

1272
01:17:11,985 --> 01:17:14,565
Speaker 4:  Lord's s new CD? Oh, which is transparent.

1273
01:17:14,835 --> 01:17:15,485
Speaker 6:  It's transparent. You made

1274
01:17:15,485 --> 01:17:19,285
Speaker 4:  Made it transparent and see it. Okay. So it turns out when you

1275
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:23,165
Speaker 4:  put a CD into certain CD players, I mean they, I guess they, they all

1276
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:27,045
Speaker 4:  use infrared to read it, but it seems like some of them maybe also use

1277
01:17:27,245 --> 01:17:31,165
Speaker 4:  infrared to register that a CD is really going in and

1278
01:17:32,275 --> 01:17:36,005
Speaker 4:  they can't see it. And so they just eject the CD and they won't put it in.

1279
01:17:36,465 --> 01:17:40,285
Speaker 4:  Andrew Marino on our team went out and these things are

1280
01:17:40,285 --> 01:17:43,405
Speaker 4:  sold out, but he managed to find one and he tested about a CD players. So

1281
01:17:43,405 --> 01:17:46,765
Speaker 4:  you have like a clam shell one where you just like put it in and close it.

1282
01:17:47,305 --> 01:17:50,565
Speaker 4:  Or I guess maybe like a disc tray. Yeah. Yeah. That will work. But otherwise,

1283
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:52,125
Speaker 4:  these Lord fans are really upset because

1284
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:56,445
Speaker 6:  You know what fair they paid for this music and now they can't listen

1285
01:17:56,445 --> 01:18:00,005
Speaker 6:  to it on their car cd. Which, you know, like, that's one reason to buy a

1286
01:18:00,025 --> 01:18:02,925
Speaker 6:  cd Yeah. Is if you have a car that still has those things. So I totally get

1287
01:18:02,925 --> 01:18:06,605
Speaker 6:  what they're saying, but at the same time, it is kind of cool to have a transparent

1288
01:18:06,745 --> 01:18:09,525
Speaker 4:  CD. Looks okay, I'm moving on with this one because I don't wanna get crashed.

1289
01:18:11,285 --> 01:18:14,965
Speaker 4:  A federal appeals court struck down the FTCs click to cancel

1290
01:18:14,995 --> 01:18:16,405
Speaker 4:  rule this week. This is

1291
01:18:16,885 --> 01:18:17,605
Speaker 6:  Bullshit. That's what

1292
01:18:17,605 --> 01:18:20,045
Speaker 4:  This is. Yeah, this is, yeah, this is, this is the thing that was gonna let

1293
01:18:20,045 --> 01:18:21,125
Speaker 4:  you cancel your gym membership.

1294
01:18:21,235 --> 01:18:22,125
Speaker 6:  This was, this

1295
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:25,965
Speaker 4:  Is, this should be a bipartisan issue. If there was ever a bipartisan

1296
01:18:25,965 --> 01:18:26,285
Speaker 4:  issue,

1297
01:18:26,545 --> 01:18:30,445
Speaker 6:  Why did they look, I I, does anyone like it when you're trying

1298
01:18:30,445 --> 01:18:33,365
Speaker 6:  to cancel a thing and they're like, actually you have to call an email. Nobody

1299
01:18:33,365 --> 01:18:36,005
Speaker 6:  likes this. Nobody wants this. This was a bipartisan, like

1300
01:18:36,435 --> 01:18:38,285
Speaker 4:  It's devastating. This is absolutely devastating.

1301
01:18:38,285 --> 01:18:38,765
Speaker 6:  This is absolutely,

1302
01:18:38,825 --> 01:18:41,645
Speaker 5:  We should have gotten this done. Who's responsible? Yeah.

1303
01:18:41,825 --> 01:18:45,685
Speaker 6:  Who is responsible for this? I'm just, why would they like, I'm sorry. Like

1304
01:18:45,685 --> 01:18:45,965
Speaker 6:  even

1305
01:18:45,985 --> 01:18:49,325
Speaker 4:  It is they okay, they said, they said the FTC did a bad job making the rule.

1306
01:18:49,545 --> 01:18:53,005
Speaker 4:  So it's, it's not like they can still do it. It's just like, will

1307
01:18:53,385 --> 01:18:55,205
Speaker 4:  the new FTC do? It was like,

1308
01:18:55,745 --> 01:18:59,685
Speaker 6:  Oh great. No they won't because the, the, I don't know, maybe I'm being mean,

1309
01:18:59,745 --> 01:19:03,685
Speaker 6:  but I feel like it's capitalist to be just like, no, make

1310
01:19:03,685 --> 01:19:07,245
Speaker 6:  it hard for them to cancel. 'cause then we can get revenue. I tried. 'cause

1311
01:19:07,245 --> 01:19:09,365
Speaker 6:  these people can't remember. Just cancel their subscriptions.

1312
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:13,965
Speaker 5:  I tried to cancel pet insurance once and it was the most ar i,

1313
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,605
Speaker 5:  I just gave up and paid another year for pet insurance.

1314
01:19:16,845 --> 01:19:19,805
Speaker 6:  Oh my God. No. That's a lot of, no,

1315
01:19:19,865 --> 01:19:22,725
Speaker 5:  You had to like write a handwritten note. Mail

1316
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:23,485
Speaker 6:  It. That's insane.

1317
01:19:23,595 --> 01:19:25,525
Speaker 5:  Call their CEOI.

1318
01:19:25,525 --> 01:19:27,485
Speaker 4:  Sorry. It's good news for your pet, I suppose.

1319
01:19:27,715 --> 01:19:28,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah, he was, he

1320
01:19:28,605 --> 01:19:29,765
Speaker 4:  Was alright. Oh. Oh,

1321
01:19:30,435 --> 01:19:34,045
Speaker 6:  That was my god. He was dead. Thunder crash. Okay.

1322
01:19:34,785 --> 01:19:35,445
Speaker 4:  Vik. He was moving.

1323
01:19:35,955 --> 01:19:39,805
Speaker 6:  Okay. So nothing's first true flagship phone plays it a

1324
01:19:39,805 --> 01:19:43,645
Speaker 6:  little safe. 'cause you know nothing. We know nothing for. Oh God, you gotta

1325
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:47,365
Speaker 6:  stop me with the nothing ponds, but nothing Oh, no. Has something going for

1326
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:51,245
Speaker 6:  it. Which is the, it's known for its forward design and this is not

1327
01:19:51,475 --> 01:19:51,765
Speaker 6:  cool.

1328
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:55,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it has. So instead of like all the lights on the back,

1329
01:19:55,915 --> 01:19:59,645
Speaker 5:  that was like the glyph thing, which looked cool,

1330
01:20:00,305 --> 01:20:03,885
Speaker 5:  wasn't super useful. I didn't find it super useful. It has a little tiny,

1331
01:20:04,115 --> 01:20:04,405
Speaker 5:  like,

1332
01:20:06,045 --> 01:20:09,455
Speaker 5:  programmable, like LED thing, sort of like the

1333
01:20:10,165 --> 01:20:14,135
Speaker 5:  asus like R phones where it

1334
01:20:14,135 --> 01:20:17,895
Speaker 5:  can be a little icon. It can be a, an emoji icon for a certain

1335
01:20:17,995 --> 01:20:21,615
Speaker 5:  app. It makes more sense to me because you could assign

1336
01:20:21,615 --> 01:20:25,295
Speaker 5:  different notifications to different glyph patterns. And I would

1337
01:20:25,615 --> 01:20:29,175
Speaker 5:  be looking at it like, I can't remember if that thing lights up. Do I have

1338
01:20:29,255 --> 01:20:33,095
Speaker 5:  a phone call or what? This is like a, a more clear, like

1339
01:20:33,275 --> 01:20:36,815
Speaker 5:  you could, you could put a little poop emoji when the phone rings or something.

1340
01:20:36,895 --> 01:20:40,575
Speaker 5:  I don't know. People were hating on it. I don't know. I think it's a good

1341
01:20:40,575 --> 01:20:40,735
Speaker 5:  idea

1342
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:44,495
Speaker 4:  Because they, they demoed it with like a spin the bottle. Oh, that's dumb.

1343
01:20:44,495 --> 01:20:48,335
Speaker 4:  Which, okay, but hear me, hear me out. I'm actually super infa. It,

1344
01:20:48,365 --> 01:20:52,015
Speaker 4:  it's the carrot sensor. They're just like, they're like, no one is gonna

1345
01:20:52,115 --> 01:20:55,655
Speaker 4:  use this. Here's your carrot. Yeah. And I love it. I love

1346
01:20:55,655 --> 01:20:58,295
Speaker 6:  It. Maybe they should have just put a little more whimsy into it. I don't

1347
01:20:58,295 --> 01:21:01,935
Speaker 6:  know. I think people have expectations. So Yeah. This didn't meet their expectations

1348
01:21:01,935 --> 01:21:03,335
Speaker 6:  of what they wanted from nothing.

1349
01:21:03,895 --> 01:21:06,455
Speaker 5:  I guess they wanted something from nothing.

1350
01:21:06,525 --> 01:21:07,375
Speaker 6:  They wanted something from

1351
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:08,295
Speaker 5:  Nothing. That doesn't work.

1352
01:21:11,355 --> 01:21:13,015
Speaker 4:  We deserve, we deserve this one. We

1353
01:21:13,015 --> 01:21:14,455
Speaker 6:  Deserve that. The crash probably to sell.

1354
01:21:14,525 --> 01:21:15,055
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah.

1355
01:21:15,895 --> 01:21:18,815
Speaker 5:  The government is still suing Apple for

1356
01:21:19,525 --> 01:21:20,135
Speaker 5:  antitrust.

1357
01:21:20,935 --> 01:21:22,785
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Good. Yeah. Yeah.

1358
01:21:23,925 --> 01:21:26,425
Speaker 5:  No, I'm very pleased to see that's still happening.

1359
01:21:27,715 --> 01:21:31,545
Speaker 4:  Apple, apple tried to get it dismissed and the judge was

1360
01:21:31,545 --> 01:21:35,455
Speaker 4:  just like, yeah, seems like they've got a case. Like, And I, they

1361
01:21:35,455 --> 01:21:38,375
Speaker 4:  didn't, you know, they didn't like rule on it in any meaningful manner. They're

1362
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:38,455
Speaker 4:  just like

1363
01:21:38,835 --> 01:21:41,655
Speaker 6:  So litigious, right? Like, they do this all the time with

1364
01:21:41,655 --> 01:21:44,655
Speaker 4:  Everything. I mean, this is, well, okay, so this is, The government was like,

1365
01:21:44,675 --> 01:21:48,215
Speaker 4:  Hey, apple, like your entire business model's anti-competitive and apple's.

1366
01:21:48,215 --> 01:21:51,255
Speaker 4:  Like, that's not true. And this judge is like, let us at least find out.

1367
01:21:51,255 --> 01:21:53,655
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So that's, that's it. That's good. That's good. That's good. I wanna

1368
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:56,935
Speaker 4:  see this play out. I think like there are huge repercussions. Yeah. Potentially.

1369
01:21:57,035 --> 01:21:59,945
Speaker 4:  So it'll be, it'll at least be a fun time in court. Yeah. Yay.

1370
01:22:00,055 --> 01:22:04,025
Speaker 6:  Yeah. All right. My turn. So Adding calendar events

1371
01:22:04,095 --> 01:22:07,745
Speaker 6:  with a screenshot is AI at its finest hard agree. Oh yeah.

1372
01:22:07,745 --> 01:22:11,545
Speaker 6:  Someone also testing the dev beta of iOS 26. Good.

1373
01:22:11,565 --> 01:22:11,985
Speaker 4:  It actually works

1374
01:22:12,005 --> 01:22:15,985
Speaker 6:  Now. Hard agree. Yeah. Yeah. For the mo it, it does the thing

1375
01:22:15,985 --> 01:22:18,545
Speaker 6:  that you want it to do. It's, it's kind of like, oh

1376
01:22:18,815 --> 01:22:22,625
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So on iOS 26, you take a screenshot of something

1377
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:27,025
Speaker 5:  and you'll get a little prompt. It'll say add the calendar

1378
01:22:27,565 --> 01:22:31,545
Speaker 5:  and it'll use generative AI to, and it, it

1379
01:22:31,545 --> 01:22:34,785
Speaker 5:  already did a version of this, but it wasn't, it, it was pretty like,

1380
01:22:35,695 --> 01:22:39,425
Speaker 5:  find the date, use the email subject line as the

1381
01:22:39,745 --> 01:22:43,505
Speaker 5:  calendar thing. And that was kind of the end of it. I will say Gemini does

1382
01:22:43,505 --> 01:22:47,345
Speaker 5:  this a lot better. Like, we will add multiple events. We'll ask you

1383
01:22:47,345 --> 01:22:50,985
Speaker 5:  follow up questions like, did you wanna add this or this? And

1384
01:22:51,365 --> 01:22:52,865
Speaker 5:  it understood. Time zones.

1385
01:22:53,445 --> 01:22:54,585
Speaker 6:  Oh, that's a big

1386
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:57,225
Speaker 5:  One's. Very good. Really good. That's a big one. I, I think it's a win all

1387
01:22:57,225 --> 01:23:01,185
Speaker 5:  around. I'm like, free us from the tyranny of calendar apps.

1388
01:23:01,615 --> 01:23:02,225
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Ugh.

1389
01:23:02,765 --> 01:23:03,865
Speaker 5:  That's what I say about that.

1390
01:23:04,175 --> 01:23:05,655
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Sold good. Yeah,

1391
01:23:06,095 --> 01:23:06,775
Speaker 6:  Absolutely. Sold on it.

1392
01:23:07,035 --> 01:23:08,335
Speaker 5:  Hey, we beat the clock. Yeah.

1393
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:09,535
Speaker 6:  Wow. This

1394
01:23:09,905 --> 01:23:10,255
Speaker 4:  Don't

1395
01:23:10,255 --> 01:23:13,175
Speaker 5:  Push it. Now I'm braced for thunder. Should

1396
01:23:13,175 --> 01:23:13,975
Speaker 4:  I take next one? Oh

1397
01:23:14,195 --> 01:23:16,735
Speaker 6:  No, they just wanna keep us on our toes. Now there's,

1398
01:23:16,735 --> 01:23:20,295
Speaker 4:  We think we've made Eric too powerful. Powell's second Generation Vision

1399
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:23,775
Speaker 4:  Pro might launch this year according to Bloomberg.

1400
01:23:25,335 --> 01:23:28,295
Speaker 4:  Supposedly they're just gonna do the pretty much exact same thing. Put an

1401
01:23:28,415 --> 01:23:32,015
Speaker 4:  M four chip in it to keep it, I mean, it is, the Vision Pro is, is

1402
01:23:32,205 --> 01:23:36,135
Speaker 4:  just, it is a Mac on your face and Yeah, it's, it's

1403
01:23:36,135 --> 01:23:38,815
Speaker 4:  heavy, rough when it's $3,500 and, and an M1 and

1404
01:23:38,815 --> 01:23:39,575
Speaker 6:  It's a heavy Mac

1405
01:23:39,575 --> 01:23:42,455
Speaker 4:  On your face. So this is the other thing. Supposedly they're gonna do some

1406
01:23:42,575 --> 01:23:46,015
Speaker 4:  sort of new strap, which like, I feel like everybody I've talked to about

1407
01:23:46,015 --> 01:23:47,895
Speaker 4:  the Vision Pro is like, you gotta get a different strap.

1408
01:23:48,075 --> 01:23:51,335
Speaker 6:  You gotta get a, like, first of, so there's two staff straps now. There's

1409
01:23:51,335 --> 01:23:54,295
Speaker 6:  the solo on it and there's the one that looks like a harness. I forget the

1410
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:58,095
Speaker 6:  name of it right now, but I keep switching between both of them.

1411
01:23:58,685 --> 01:24:02,415
Speaker 6:  Neither of them help. It's just I can't, I, you know,

1412
01:24:03,015 --> 01:24:06,925
Speaker 6:  I, I'm not calling the people who believe that, like, you can wear it for

1413
01:24:06,925 --> 01:24:10,405
Speaker 6:  hours, liars. But I have never been able to do that.

1414
01:24:10,705 --> 01:24:14,365
Speaker 4:  So, okay. I'm gonna keep us quick on this next one too. As we, as we move

1415
01:24:14,365 --> 01:24:18,045
Speaker 4:  forward. Nvidia briefly became the first four

1416
01:24:18,285 --> 01:24:21,925
Speaker 4:  trillion company this week. The thing that's interesting here,

1417
01:24:22,135 --> 01:24:25,605
Speaker 4:  apple was the first 1 trillion. Apple was the first

1418
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:29,405
Speaker 4:  American company to 2 trillion. Apple was the first company of 3 trillion.

1419
01:24:30,225 --> 01:24:33,965
Speaker 4:  Nvidia wins with 4 trillion. It's ai, it's right, it's, it's, it's the ai,

1420
01:24:33,965 --> 01:24:34,245
Speaker 4:  it's

1421
01:24:34,245 --> 01:24:34,365
Speaker 6:  Ai

1422
01:24:34,915 --> 01:24:35,205
Speaker 4:  Chip.

1423
01:24:35,545 --> 01:24:36,285
Speaker 6:  The chips need to,

1424
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:40,285
Speaker 4:  The times have changed. Apple is merely a three trillion company.

1425
01:24:40,465 --> 01:24:40,685
Speaker 4:  Oh,

1426
01:24:41,305 --> 01:24:41,685
Speaker 5:  I'm Miss Machine.

1427
01:24:42,515 --> 01:24:45,325
Speaker 4:  Your our, our thoughts are with Tim on these trying times.

1428
01:24:45,495 --> 01:24:49,125
Speaker 6:  These trying times. He has his biceps to keep him company. Yeah.

1429
01:24:49,155 --> 01:24:51,885
Speaker 4:  True. Okay. Do you know Cameo still around?

1430
01:24:52,645 --> 01:24:53,605
Speaker 6:  I did not know it was still around

1431
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:57,645
Speaker 4:  Cameo. Not only is still around, they launched a new app this week for tracking

1432
01:24:57,675 --> 01:25:01,425
Speaker 4:  your friend's birthdays. It's it calendar, but it only does birthdays. Do

1433
01:25:01,425 --> 01:25:01,625
Speaker 5:  We need,

1434
01:25:01,765 --> 01:25:02,185
Speaker 6:  That's

1435
01:25:02,185 --> 01:25:04,105
Speaker 4:  Dumb. And I don't And Cameo is doing it. Why?

1436
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:04,545
Speaker 6:  I don't,

1437
01:25:05,285 --> 01:25:07,705
Speaker 4:  Oh, I guess is the idea that then you're like, oh, oh,

1438
01:25:07,725 --> 01:25:11,385
Speaker 6:  Oh, it's my friend's birthday. I should get them a, a cameo from that random

1439
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:13,105
Speaker 6:  select. Oh yeah.

1440
01:25:13,855 --> 01:25:14,145
Speaker 4:  Okay.

1441
01:25:14,145 --> 01:25:17,665
Speaker 6:  That's kind of genius. But also, no, no.

1442
01:25:17,985 --> 01:25:21,785

01:26:03,105 --> 01:26:07,005
Speaker 6:  No, I have bad eyes. Like I have truly awful eyes and

Speaker 5:  Yeah, no, it's frosted glass.

1466
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:30,565

1467
01:26:30,565 --> 01:26:33,685
Speaker 6:  which make the whole transparency thing not because like, if you go into

1468
01:26:33,685 --> 01:26:37,405
Speaker 6:  the messages, you can't see any of the buttons. Yeah.
