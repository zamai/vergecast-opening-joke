2
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:55,425
Speaker 2:  Hello and welcome to Our Chest, the flagship podcast of Mobility

3
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:58,065
Speaker 2:  Solutions here at CSS 2024.

4
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:03,465
Speaker 2:  That's if you spend enough time at CES, you just start to

5
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:03,945
Speaker 2:  talk like that.

6
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:04,585
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

7
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:05,665
Speaker 2:  You just can't help it.

8
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:09,385
Speaker 4:  You start saying the word innovative. Yeah. Like as all parts of speech.

9
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:13,145
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And just lose all track of what's actually words.

10
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:15,625
Speaker 2:  You just, you just look around. There's companies here, no one's ever heard

11
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,105
Speaker 2:  of selling.

12
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:16,825
Speaker 4:  Enable Selling

13
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:21,025
Speaker 2:  By ai. Enabled by ai. Remember to solutionize the future of innovation.

14
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:21,505
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

15
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:23,865
Speaker 4:  With hk, with eight K and

16
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:27,025
Speaker 2:  5G, with eight K and 5G. It's all, it's all happening all at once. Hi, I'm

17
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:30,585
Speaker 2:  your friend Eli. I'm here at css. We're here in the Kia connected home, which

18
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:34,345
Speaker 2:  means we're above a number of Kias downstairs, which I'm told are powering

19
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:34,625
Speaker 2:  the home,

20
00:01:34,915 --> 00:01:38,265
Speaker 4:  Which is kind of cool. Yeah. Yes. We also have a view that I would call like

21
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:42,825
Speaker 4:  Regal above CES. Oh yeah. We're sort of gazing upon our

22
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:43,705
Speaker 4:  kingdom. I

23
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:46,265
Speaker 2:  Feel very powerful. I'm just saying we're slightly above the Google booth

24
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:48,825
Speaker 2:  right next door. It's, that's

25
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:49,665
Speaker 4:  Right. It feels right. What's

26
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:53,545
Speaker 2:  Up Android? David Pierce is here. Hi. Alex Francis is here.

27
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:57,105
Speaker 2:  Hi. There's a whole Verge team here at cs. A huge number of people.

28
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:00,785
Speaker 2:  We've been out on the show floor. It's the day after all the press

29
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:04,705
Speaker 2:  conferences. There's an awful lot of news here at css. Yeah. And

30
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:07,585
Speaker 2:  David, you have some sort of gambit to organize our two CSS shows.

31
00:02:07,905 --> 00:02:11,785
Speaker 4:  I do. So we have to do two shows this week at CES. And the thing

32
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:15,745
Speaker 4:  about CES is it's just a grab bag of things. Yeah.

33
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:20,385
Speaker 4:  And so we, we broke it into two things Today we're going to talk about things

34
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:24,025
Speaker 4:  that are mostly screens. I believe you called them Screen gadgets. Yeah.

35
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:27,785
Speaker 4:  And then on Thursday we're gonna talk about all the things that aren't screens.

36
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:31,785
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Do these things blur together? Yes. All the time.

37
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:35,985
Speaker 4:  Is the Venn diagram of them mostly nonsensical and made up In my head? Yes.

38
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,705
Speaker 4:  But this is, this is what we're gonna do. So today is the screens day. Yeah.

39
00:02:39,705 --> 00:02:43,025
Speaker 4:  There's like a version of this where we were like, okay, it's kind of a car

40
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:46,625
Speaker 4:  show, it's kind of a TV show. Let's talk about those things. But it's just

41
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,345
Speaker 4:  like, we're gonna do screens and no screens.

42
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,065
Speaker 2:  It's a better organizing principle than CSS has for itself,

43
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:56,185
Speaker 2:  which this year is just a mishmash of ideas. They're like

44
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:59,965
Speaker 2:  ai, do you want AI to do it? At one point VW announced

45
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:03,805
Speaker 2:  that you could just talk to chat GPT in the car. Sure. Which

46
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,405
Speaker 2:  seems like don don't know if you guys are aware of this chat. GT often makes

47
00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:11,365
Speaker 2:  things up. So just being confidently lied to while you drive

48
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:13,325
Speaker 2:  is now a feature of the new vw.

49
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:16,605
Speaker 4:  There's so much of that this year where yeah, somebody is just like, well

50
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:20,575
Speaker 4:  we made a product last year and now that product,

51
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:25,175
Speaker 4:  but also Chad, GPT and nothing else. Is that new? Yeah.

52
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:26,335
Speaker 2:  Is that what you want?

53
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:30,015
Speaker 4:  Like telly, the the free TV we talked a bunch about on the show. Their new

54
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:33,975
Speaker 4:  thing is you can talk to chat GPT to get like recommendations for stuff

55
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:37,575
Speaker 4:  to watch. Which I think is hilarious because to your point, Ja, GBT loves

56
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:41,295
Speaker 4:  to like make up movies that don't exist. So you can just like

57
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:45,095
Speaker 4:  invent movies out of whole cloth and then not watch them on your free television.

58
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:45,575
Speaker 4:  Well, show

59
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:48,735
Speaker 2:  Show is advertising to you. Right. We should actually start with with TVs.

60
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:52,735
Speaker 2:  So if you don't know CSS is a consumer electronic show. We're here in Las

61
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:56,215
Speaker 2:  Vegas is the biggest industry trade show there is.

62
00:03:56,965 --> 00:04:00,175
Speaker 2:  That does not mean the entire industry is here in an odd way.

63
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,415
Speaker 2:  Apple for example, is not here. But Apple loves to

64
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,895
Speaker 2:  upstage CES. So they announced the Vision Pro early this week. We'll, we'll

65
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:11,695
Speaker 2:  get to that later in the show. Microsoft isn't here. They all have employees

66
00:04:11,695 --> 00:04:15,455
Speaker 2:  here and people here wandering around. But in terms of announcements, css,

67
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,855
Speaker 2:  it waxes and wanes. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Google is here, but Google

68
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,495
Speaker 2:  didn't make a lot of announcements, but everything runs Android. So

69
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,815
Speaker 2:  technically millions of Android products were announced here. It's Cs. So

70
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:28,815
Speaker 2:  it just, it it's a real grab bag of things. The in, the good thing about

71
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:32,295
Speaker 2:  it is that everyone is here. Right? Everyone's talking. If you're a tech

72
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:36,335
Speaker 2:  reporter, this is fish in a barrel. Yeah. You're just in Las Vegas

73
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:40,375
Speaker 2:  and everyone is holding a drink and ready to tell you a story about something.

74
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:44,455
Speaker 2:  And in fact ready to tell you how much they think the Vision Pro costs to

75
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:47,575
Speaker 2:  build. Which has been the best gossip of the week for me. Just people yelling

76
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:51,175
Speaker 2:  numbers. So making up numbers outta blue. But the history of CSS

77
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:55,455
Speaker 2:  is that this is a show where TVs are announced. Yeah. Like in the long history

78
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:59,175
Speaker 2:  of css, the, the one constant that has held the show together

79
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:02,775
Speaker 2:  and really given it its sort of center of gravity, is the TV industry shows

80
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:06,695
Speaker 2:  up here. They show you new TVs. The buyers from retailers

81
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:10,295
Speaker 2:  like Best Buy and Amazon and don don't know who Circuit City. Circuit City

82
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:11,895
Speaker 2:  still exists. They show up,

83
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,135
Speaker 4:  They do. RCA has a big booth here. Everybody's

84
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:16,695
Speaker 2:  Coming back. Liam is telling me Circuit City no longer exists, rip Circuit

85
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:20,335
Speaker 2:  City. But anyway, the buyers from those big retailers show up. They, they

86
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:23,935
Speaker 2:  debate about what will be the hot trends in TVs to sell this year. They place

87
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:27,095
Speaker 2:  their orders and then later in the year, The TVs show up on, on on the retailer

88
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:30,495
Speaker 2:  shelves. That's been the pattern, still the pattern here at css. Although

89
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:34,455
Speaker 2:  interestingly, Sony has broken this pattern now two years in a row. Yeah,

90
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:38,575
Speaker 2:  no. TVs at CSS and the, the big Sony booth at the end of the hall

91
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:42,615
Speaker 2:  has no TVs in it. Wow. Like there are TVs to show you other

92
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:46,415
Speaker 2:  Sony stuff, but there's not even like a whisper of like Sony's TV

93
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:50,335
Speaker 2:  models. Right. It's like PlayStation stuff, some camera stuff, half

94
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:53,895
Speaker 2:  a car. Then the rest of the car that Sony's building with Honda, which we'll

95
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,895
Speaker 2:  talk about on Thursday, they're just outta the game. Like Sony wants the

96
00:05:56,895 --> 00:06:00,885
Speaker 2:  high, high end of the TV market and then the rest of it is kinda up

97
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:04,005
Speaker 2:  for grabs. Yeah. So we should start with the other announcements. But that

98
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:07,245
Speaker 2:  to me is just the fascinating turn of the show. As I think about the tech

99
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:11,365
Speaker 2:  industry, this has been the place where TVs get announced and Sony's opting

100
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:14,565
Speaker 2:  out Samsung and LG, which obviously dominate the TV market.

101
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:19,285
Speaker 2:  They are doing stuff but they're don don't know. They're kinda

102
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:22,325
Speaker 2:  like, what if the TV was clear? You know? It's like they're, yeah. They're

103
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:25,725
Speaker 2:  in that zone with it. And then the the cheaper brands, the TCLs, the high

104
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:29,405
Speaker 2:  senses. I wanna talk a lot about mini LED. They're coming up fast.

105
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:32,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It feels like for the big companies, they've gotten kind of less and

106
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:35,845
Speaker 4:  less practical over time with what they show off. These are just sort of

107
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:39,405
Speaker 4:  like tech demos. Yeah. And some of 'em are very cool tech demos. Well I think

108
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:43,245
Speaker 5:  They, they plateaued, right? Like the technology is plateaued so well

109
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:46,165
Speaker 4:  So I don't think that's true, but I think Oh really people don't care anymore.

110
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:48,245
Speaker 4:  That's very true. Right? Like true. The technology keeps getting better.

111
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:52,405
Speaker 4:  But my ability to experience said technology as like long

112
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:56,045
Speaker 4:  sin plateaued. So the only thing to do is like get real weird with it. Yeah.

113
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:59,205
Speaker 4:  Because, and I think part of what we were gonna talk about in a little while

114
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:03,085
Speaker 4:  is like monitors which are now on this run of like getting better

115
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:06,085
Speaker 4:  to the point where you're not gonna start to notice the difference anymore.

116
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:09,085
Speaker 4:  But there was just like more to do with computer monitors. Whereas like if

117
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:12,845
Speaker 4:  you wanna kick ass TV, that is too high res for you to know the

118
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:15,045
Speaker 4:  difference. Anyway, you've had that for a while.

119
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:18,285
Speaker 2:  Oh my friend, I'm ready to talk about this. Alright, so we should talk about

120
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:22,175
Speaker 2:  some news because I think there's, this year it's css. I think that has been

121
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,935
Speaker 2:  true for a minute. It's about to stop being true again in a really exciting

122
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:28,775
Speaker 2:  way. So the news Samsung LG LG has a new transparent

123
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:31,175
Speaker 2:  OLED tv. It's the T

124
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:32,455
Speaker 4:  Dealed T

125
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:33,815
Speaker 2:  OLED t That's

126
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:35,535
Speaker 5:  T-V-T-T-V-T.

127
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:37,455
Speaker 2:  That's, that's what they're calling it.

128
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:39,135
Speaker 4:  It's T for C through.

129
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:42,935
Speaker 2:  It's, it's clear it has like a black thing that you can motorize

130
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:45,695
Speaker 2:  pull down to make it not clear. But then you can make it clear again.

131
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,495
Speaker 2:  Chris Welch looked through it, he was blown away. You can read that piece.

132
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:51,415
Speaker 2:  I went and looked at it on the show floor. It's just out.

133
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:55,575
Speaker 5:  Did you notice a crucial thing about it? No. So one of the, one of

134
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,735
Speaker 5:  them they had, they were playing like wheel of time on it. Yeah. And they

135
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:02,255
Speaker 5:  had motion smoothing on Ooh on their like invisible

136
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:06,095
Speaker 5:  well transparent TV that everybody should care about. Motion

137
00:08:06,095 --> 00:08:07,375
Speaker 5:  smoothing. That was just like

138
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:09,455
Speaker 4:  Somewhere Tom Cruise is furious. I

139
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,895
Speaker 2:  Didn't, I was furious. I didn't actually see content. I just saw like CES

140
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:16,455
Speaker 2:  demo reels. Yeah. And it was like, like water falling, you know,

141
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,815
Speaker 2:  Flowers opening. They

142
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:21,015
Speaker 5:  Were beautiful. Yeah. This such smooth

143
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:21,495
Speaker 4:  Motion. And

144
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:21,975
Speaker 2:  Then you saw real content,

145
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:25,255
Speaker 5:  You're like, yeah there was like, there was one TV like in a corner and it

146
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:28,815
Speaker 5:  was playing just some of wheel of time being like, isn't Amazon Prime great?

147
00:08:28,995 --> 00:08:32,655
Speaker 5:  And I was like hmm. Is it? And also motion smoothing.

148
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:36,575
Speaker 5:  Yikes. I turned into Tom Cruise for a moment. I can you, I almost kicked

149
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:37,095
Speaker 5:  the TV in.

150
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,655
Speaker 2:  Does the transparent TV have film remote? Because I'd like to enable it.

151
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:40,135
Speaker 2:  Please. I was

152
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:42,695
Speaker 5:  Like, can I have a remote real quick? I just need to fix something for you.

153
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:46,495
Speaker 2:  Show up at CSS with an LG remote. Just like, so that's, that's

154
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:50,615
Speaker 2:  lgs big announcement. Samsung has its own riff on a transparent display.

155
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:54,695
Speaker 2:  They're very excited about all that. Samsung has, Samsung famously

156
00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:58,565
Speaker 2:  is now now doing QD OLEDs. Quantum OLEDs. That's the panel Sony's using and

157
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:02,525
Speaker 2:  it's, it's high-end OLEDs. They're doing anti-glare on that.

158
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:06,405
Speaker 2:  Here's my argument to you about all these TVs. OLED is hitting a weird

159
00:09:06,765 --> 00:09:10,485
Speaker 2:  interesting peak. So the sort of base technology reed is like where it's

160
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:14,125
Speaker 2:  at Samsung displays between Quantum Dots in front of

161
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:18,285
Speaker 2:  OLED pixels to make 'em brighter. LG is doing the micro lens array,

162
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:21,085
Speaker 2:  which is, I mean all this is really cool. Yeah. They're just like trying

163
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:23,885
Speaker 2:  to make the OLEDs brighter. Right. But the fundamental technology is like

164
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:27,685
Speaker 2:  hit its point and it's gotten to about 77 inches and that's kind of how big

165
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:31,045
Speaker 2:  they can get 'em. LG LG can get to like 83.

166
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:34,925
Speaker 2:  But do you need bigger? So here's, here's what Yeah we're gonna, here's what's

167
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:38,765
Speaker 2:  happening. And those are expensive. Like a big OLED TV is like pretty

168
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:42,045
Speaker 2:  expensive. Yeah. Like a Sony A 80 is like a pretty expensive TV

169
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:46,125
Speaker 2:  that's four four grand. Right. And that's about as big as ole like 83 is.

170
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:50,045
Speaker 2:  Right? That's basically it. If you walk on the show floor, you see

171
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:53,525
Speaker 2:  mini L led D TVs are everywhere. Yeah. Yeah.

172
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:57,845
Speaker 2:  TCL is all in on them. High sense is all in on them. High sense is

173
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:01,605
Speaker 2:  picking up from Samsung. They know that people think like, oh

174
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,965
Speaker 2:  lead is good. So high sense is like ours are U LEDs.

175
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:09,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The longest time. So, or Samsung is like Q eds.

176
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,405
Speaker 2:  It's like you think people are so stupid.

177
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:17,205
Speaker 2:  Like truly you think people are so dumb they'll do it. So if you, if you're

178
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:20,685
Speaker 2:  not caught up on this, the thing that is happening with back lights on LCD

179
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:24,525
Speaker 2:  TVs and LCD TV can't make light by itself. You can make the color so you

180
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:27,845
Speaker 2:  need to put a back light behind it. Those back lights have basically gotten

181
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:31,285
Speaker 2:  more and more advanced over the years. They started out with literally fluorescent

182
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:34,505
Speaker 2:  lights on the side of the tv. They didn't look great.

183
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:38,345
Speaker 2:  Like old, like old, old LCDs. Literally fluorescent lights on the side of

184
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:42,065
Speaker 2:  the, on the side of the, of the panels. Then you got into like LEDs

185
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:45,065
Speaker 2:  behind the panels. That's where you get LED D TVs. That's where people are

186
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:47,825
Speaker 2:  always talking about. Then you started adding local dimming. You started

187
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:51,385
Speaker 2:  turning those LEDs on and off in zones. Then there was a hilarious spec race

188
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:53,945
Speaker 2:  over how many zones of local dimming you could have. Oh that's the best.

189
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,905
Speaker 2:  That was good. Which is thousands of zones. Right. And then you, what

190
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:01,225
Speaker 2:  do you, what's next? You make the LEDs themselves smaller, you pack 'em more

191
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:05,185
Speaker 2:  on, you get more zones. You're now up to like 6,000 zones. 60,000 zones is

192
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:07,225
Speaker 2:  like one of the claims that's out there. I don dunno if that's true or not.

193
00:11:07,255 --> 00:11:10,305
Speaker 2:  It's too many zones. It's too many zones looking at this thing, I was like

194
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:13,385
Speaker 2:  I don dunno. The same company put a U in front of the LED to confuse people.

195
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:17,185
Speaker 2:  Like whatever you want man. And so this thing, if you look at these TVs that

196
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:20,905
Speaker 2:  back lits are really bright. They have really, really, really well controlled

197
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:24,865
Speaker 2:  local dimming and they look amazing. They do. And they're

198
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:28,425
Speaker 2:  cheap as hell to make. 'cause they're just still LCD TVs and the core

199
00:11:28,545 --> 00:11:32,065
Speaker 2:  LCD technology is all the way at the bottom of the cost curve. Like all the

200
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:33,945
Speaker 2:  way bought because we've been doing this for a long time. We're doing it

201
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:36,705
Speaker 2:  forever. Yeah. And what, what we've been iterating on is the backlight. So

202
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:40,305
Speaker 2:  now the backlight is starting to come down the cost curve. This mini LED

203
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:42,825
Speaker 2:  and this is like year three or four that we've been typed many other day.

204
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:46,465
Speaker 2:  This is the year that it's down the cost curve. And the thing that these

205
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:50,425
Speaker 2:  manufacturers are doing is they're not saying we've made a better cheaper

206
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:54,325
Speaker 2:  65 inch tv. They're saying, what if you bought a 98

207
00:11:54,325 --> 00:11:55,485
Speaker 2:  inch tv? Oh

208
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:56,645
Speaker 5:  That's too much.

209
00:11:57,065 --> 00:12:00,885
Speaker 2:  And TCL has a giant display that's like, we are the number one provider of

210
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:04,725
Speaker 2:  98 inch TVs in the country. And this is our fastest

211
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,765
Speaker 2:  growing like model.

212
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:10,165
Speaker 4:  There's this amazing graph in the TCL booth that they have printed up next

213
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:14,125
Speaker 4:  to one of their TVs that is like percentage growth of various

214
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:17,805
Speaker 4:  sizes. And all the other ones are, you know, like steady growth from 60 to

215
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:21,245
Speaker 4:  70. Steady growth. Steady growth. And then the highest one

216
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:25,485
Speaker 4:  is like 398% growth. And it's like first of all that means you

217
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:29,245
Speaker 4:  sold 16 TVs and you sold 40 TVs. So like

218
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:30,685
Speaker 4:  cool, great job.

219
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,285
Speaker 2:  Get outta here. You math magician.

220
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:37,885
Speaker 4:  But I do think like we, we've talked about this before and and like you in

221
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:40,485
Speaker 4:  particular are kind of an OLED purist. Yeah. Like you,

222
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,405
Speaker 2:  You, I came very close to buying a mini lady Sony and I was like couldn't

223
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:43,525
Speaker 2:  do it.

224
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:47,525
Speaker 4:  But I think all these companies are correctly betting that most

225
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:51,325
Speaker 4:  people are less obnoxious than you about TVs.

226
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,445
Speaker 4:  And thus we'll buy something that is

227
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:58,965
Speaker 4:  95% as good as OLED for a

228
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:01,005
Speaker 4:  literal fraction of the price. Yes. And

229
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:04,165
Speaker 2:  Brighter. Right. And this is, and this is the thing that, and basically what

230
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:08,005
Speaker 2:  you lose is off axis viewing. So an OLED looks

231
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:11,645
Speaker 2:  perfect from basically any angle LCD screen. You're familiar with LCD

232
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:15,365
Speaker 2:  screens, you get wide enough, things get weird. Right. But it's still

233
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:18,245
Speaker 2:  pretty good on these TVs. Especially when The TVs are huge. Yeah. It's actually

234
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:21,485
Speaker 2:  very hard to get off axis on a 98 inch tv. You need a

235
00:13:21,485 --> 00:13:22,525
Speaker 4:  Big couch. I'm

236
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:26,365
Speaker 2:  Four miles away to the left. So you have this huge tv, it's really bright.

237
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:30,365
Speaker 2:  'cause you can make an L CD really bright and like you have to go look

238
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:33,365
Speaker 2:  for the blooming. Yeah. Yeah. On some of these video, not all of them, they're

239
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:36,205
Speaker 2:  gonna be all prices and shapes. But I'm just telling you this is the year

240
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:39,885
Speaker 2:  that that technology just like enters the mainstream. And

241
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,485
Speaker 2:  I think it will probably take the default big TV size from

242
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:47,285
Speaker 2:  65, maybe not to 98, but it'll go from 65 to

243
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,725
Speaker 2:  75 pretty fast. 'cause it's gonna be cheaper, bigger and brighter.

244
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:55,245
Speaker 2:  And it's gonna look in a store almost as good as ead. Yeah. Like

245
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:58,045
Speaker 2:  almost as good as ead. Like I really had to look on the show floor. And the

246
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,325
Speaker 2:  show floor is like a bad environment and it's like bright and crazy and all

247
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:04,005
Speaker 2:  The TVs are cranked up to, to 9,000 knits or whatever like,

248
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:07,445
Speaker 5:  And they're playing like the best content to make the TV look good. Yeah.

249
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:09,565
Speaker 5:  There are no blacks. You, you cannot see

250
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:12,645
Speaker 2:  No there. So this is the demo that in particular Tcell is doing. There's

251
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:16,405
Speaker 2:  big TV and it's like, you know it's a flower over black.

252
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:16,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

253
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:19,445
Speaker 4:  Or like an Edison light bulb just kinda lighting up in the middle of it.

254
00:14:19,465 --> 00:14:20,045
Speaker 4:  So they're trying

255
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:20,925
Speaker 2:  Stress the TV

256
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:23,125
Speaker 4:  And they have a few that are settings. Were you playing with the button?

257
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:23,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

258
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:26,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. You can push the button, you can basically put it in a mode that simul.

259
00:14:26,355 --> 00:14:29,765
Speaker 2:  It's an old backlight and you turn it on and it does the mini lady backlight

260
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:32,565
Speaker 2:  and it looks amazing. It looks really good. Now this is a totally controlled

261
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:32,725
Speaker 2:  demo.

262
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:33,925
Speaker 5:  I'm just remembering, do you remember,

263
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,925
Speaker 2:  I'm not gonna promise you that this is perfect. Huh? Do you remember

264
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:39,045
Speaker 5:  Like 10 years ago when Vizio did their a hundred and I think it was like

265
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:42,605
Speaker 5:  120 inch tv? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it was the ugliest thing and

266
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:44,005
Speaker 4:  Everybody was like, this is preposterous.

267
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:47,765
Speaker 5:  Like you could only check it out like in a giant warehouse. 'cause that's

268
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:51,605
Speaker 5:  the only place the TV would fit. And it was garbage tv. Yeah. It was just

269
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:52,925
Speaker 5:  the ugliest tv possible.

270
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:56,885
Speaker 2:  That's when they, that's when we people started doing really intense local

271
00:14:56,885 --> 00:15:00,805
Speaker 2:  dimming demos. Yeah. And TV companies will still like the drop of a

272
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:03,925
Speaker 2:  hat. A TV company will go this the summer. Like here's a TV without the tv.

273
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:07,805
Speaker 2:  It's just the backlight. And then I'll show you like half the screen has

274
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:11,085
Speaker 2:  a TV on it and the other half is just the backlight. Yeah. Look at the backlight

275
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:12,365
Speaker 2:  move with the, the image and you

276
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:15,445
Speaker 5:  Just watch Sandra Bullock like spiral out and turn into lights.

277
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:18,325
Speaker 2:  Pretty good. Pretty good. Demo all around. I'm just saying this is the year

278
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:21,845
Speaker 2:  you see it on the show floor this year it's everywhere. And

279
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:26,125
Speaker 2:  you know, my prediction is always rooted in my firm belief that people

280
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:30,005
Speaker 2:  will pick big sheep screens. And so if you can give people a

281
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:33,965
Speaker 2:  screen at at 65 say that is almost as good as an A lid

282
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:37,045
Speaker 2:  but cheaper, they're gonna pick that one. Right. Especially they can't tell.

283
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:40,685
Speaker 2:  And then if you can get and it's brighter, which is always the thing. Well

284
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:40,885
Speaker 2:  like

285
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:44,685
Speaker 4:  I, to that point actually, like it makes me think of the, the test Marquez

286
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:47,445
Speaker 4:  Brownley does every year with the smartphone cameras. Yeah. And every year

287
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:50,765
Speaker 4:  what wins is just the brightest camera. Yeah. It's like people don't want

288
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:54,665
Speaker 4:  anything else, but it's just, if it's bright and there's lots of colors that's

289
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:56,705
Speaker 4:  people are into it. They're, and it's the same thing. You, you see it in

290
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,825
Speaker 4:  a store, it's the same thing. It's why they crank the brightness to

291
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:01,705
Speaker 4:  50000%. But

292
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:04,665
Speaker 2:  I, the, the thing that that I think is just like really interesting. It's

293
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:08,345
Speaker 2:  like, oh man, like what if the baseline size of a TV gets

294
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:12,305
Speaker 2:  even bigger next year and it's, you're no longer picking 55 and

295
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:16,065
Speaker 2:  65. You're picking between like 65, 75 and 85 and

296
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:18,425
Speaker 2:  98. It could be kinda wild.

297
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:22,625
Speaker 4:  My wife steadfastly refuses to buy a TV above 50 inches for our

298
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:26,185
Speaker 4:  house Ooh. She just thinks anything over 50 inches is like outrageous and

299
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,905
Speaker 4:  unnecessary and no one should have it. And the number of choices

300
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,825
Speaker 4:  that we have under 50 inches is getting so small.

301
00:16:33,935 --> 00:16:35,905
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So like it's crazy. And

302
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:36,985
Speaker 5:  The TVs aren't very good at that

303
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:40,905
Speaker 4:  Size. No, they're trash. You can't buy a good TVs. Which is

304
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:41,625
Speaker 4:  why we have like, you

305
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,865
Speaker 2:  Gotta get to 55 crappy

306
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:44,985
Speaker 4:  TCL L Roku. What could you tell Anna this

307
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:45,545
Speaker 2:  Please. Yeah.

308
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:48,465
Speaker 5:  Can you like black out the 65 inch on the box and just,

309
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:49,825
Speaker 4:  I promise

310
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,185
Speaker 5:  It's 50. Yeah. Don't worry about

311
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:53,545
Speaker 4:  It. She's like, I thought the other one was 50. Like no, that one's 30 You

312
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:53,825
Speaker 4:  don't

313
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:55,025
Speaker 5:  Like say they measure 'em differently now

314
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:55,585
Speaker 4:  Don't measure it. It's

315
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:57,945
Speaker 2:  Fine. It's fine. Don't measure the tv. So that actually brings us to like

316
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:01,865
Speaker 2:  the next thing that's happening here, which is for all of this

317
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:05,305
Speaker 2:  talk about fancy backlight technologies and good looking pictures.

318
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,225
Speaker 2:  The bestselling TV in the country is the Frame TV

319
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:09,905
Speaker 5:  Just you're nemesis,

320
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:13,105
Speaker 2:  It just, it's the proud owner of Frame tv. Well

321
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:15,385
Speaker 4:  Those, those two things totally square for me. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Like if

322
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:18,985
Speaker 4:  you're gonna put this increasingly humongous thing

323
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:22,865
Speaker 4:  in your home, like an 85 inch black

324
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:24,625
Speaker 4:  panel just looks ridiculous.

325
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:28,785
Speaker 2:  I see. In my mind it's beautiful. That looks like a symbol of success,

326
00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:33,585
Speaker 2:  stability. But you are correct, most people do not just want a wall

327
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,305
Speaker 2:  of black in their ass. Right. They would prefer to have a middling, single

328
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:40,985
Speaker 2:  backlight, extremely bad LCD panel. It's extreme.

329
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:44,985
Speaker 2:  It's all want throwing some art. The frame is

330
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:49,325
Speaker 2:  wildly successful. Yeah, it is. It dominates Samsung's TV sales.

331
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:53,125
Speaker 2:  They they love it. It is, I'm just gonna tell you it is not

332
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,885
Speaker 2:  a great tv. Like it's a find It will do the job. They've

333
00:17:56,885 --> 00:18:00,845
Speaker 2:  updated it nothing this year because it is basically fine and

334
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:03,325
Speaker 2:  they're just, they're flying off the shelves. The update for the frame this

335
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:07,285
Speaker 2:  year is that now in art mode, the refresh rate lowers to 60 hertz

336
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,085
Speaker 2:  instead of just staying at one 20.

337
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,165
Speaker 4:  Sick.

338
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:14,285
Speaker 2:  If you have been following like cell phones for any period of time, you're

339
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:18,205
Speaker 2:  like, oh this is four generations behind variable refresh tech

340
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:21,165
Speaker 2:  in cell phones. And Samsung's like, no, no, this is plugged into the wall

341
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:25,125
Speaker 2:  all the time. We're going down to 60 to show us static image of a painting.

342
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:30,165
Speaker 2:  The frame is a monopoly. I'm just telling you right now, the frame is a monopoly.

343
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:33,965
Speaker 2:  They feel no competitive pressure and they're like whatever. You want some

344
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:34,165
Speaker 2:  art.

345
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:37,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Everybody's out here now making things that they want to be frame

346
00:18:37,805 --> 00:18:41,045
Speaker 4:  competitors. Yeah. And what they are is just television.

347
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:46,165
Speaker 2:  Right. So TCL has an art store. I, it's unclear what that

348
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,165
Speaker 2:  is. They have a a, there's just a sign on the show for it says TCL Art. Yeah.

349
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:52,165
Speaker 2:  And art is written in like marker font and

350
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:55,965
Speaker 4:  All it is on the booth is a TV with a bunch of paintings around it. And it's

351
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:58,765
Speaker 4:  like, I think you fundamentally misunderstand what the frame is doing.

352
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:02,965
Speaker 2:  High Sense has a like it looks like a Jetson's tv. That's the, the art tv.

353
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:06,405
Speaker 2:  See? Yeah. Okay. So everyone's trying to come at this idea, which is the

354
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:09,285
Speaker 2:  TV should look good one's off. And I think Samsung just has such a dominant

355
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:14,165
Speaker 2:  position here that they just do not care. It would be cool if the TV

356
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:14,845
Speaker 2:  was better.

357
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,525
Speaker 4:  Well, but that's also one of the reasons I think that transparent displays

358
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:19,565
Speaker 4:  are interesting. It's 'cause like, and this is the stuff we were talking

359
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:23,325
Speaker 4:  about last week too, that these things are sort of increasingly

360
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:27,165
Speaker 4:  furniture and there's a feeling like this should blend into the rest of my

361
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:31,125
Speaker 4:  house instead of just being a gigantic black

362
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:32,165
Speaker 4:  thing. To the

363
00:19:32,165 --> 00:19:35,365
Speaker 5:  Point that LG one is, is furniture like Right. And

364
00:19:35,365 --> 00:19:38,125
Speaker 4:  They actually got like shelves like going it with Right. With all this other

365
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,845
Speaker 4:  stuff on the stand and yeah. I think that's really cool.

366
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:44,925
Speaker 5:  I I think it's like very, very cool. I would almost wanna get one,

367
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:49,325
Speaker 5:  but like Chris Welch pointed out the, the picture's kind of garbage when

368
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:52,485
Speaker 5:  you just wanna watch tv. It's like, it's worse but it it's better than the

369
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:53,285
Speaker 5:  frame at least.

370
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:55,245
Speaker 4:  So is everything. Yeah. It's like

371
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:57,365
Speaker 5:  No bar but better than the frame. No,

372
00:19:57,365 --> 00:20:00,205
Speaker 4:  I think that's right. But I think that trend I think is super interesting.

373
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:03,125
Speaker 4:  even that we're not getting what we should have. 'cause the transparent thing

374
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,765
Speaker 4:  is also gonna cost a billion dollars and it kind of

375
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:10,645
Speaker 4:  sits in a really awkward way in that it's actually gonna call more

376
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:13,525
Speaker 4:  attention to itself Yes. Than a normal TV would. 'cause we're all kind of

377
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:16,285
Speaker 4:  conditioned to not notice TVs. It's just a fireplace

378
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:20,885
Speaker 5:  On for it the whole time. You're like, I have a wire frame fireplace. Don't

379
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,925
Speaker 4:  Worry about it. Yeah. Like the fish tank mode just 24 7. Yeah. I

380
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,725
Speaker 2:  Love it. I The fish tank thing is so cool.

381
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:28,565
Speaker 4:  I swear that was the moment it clicked for me. 'cause I was like, oh this

382
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:31,365
Speaker 4:  is going to fancy doctor's offices. Yeah. Like that's, that's who's gonna

383
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:31,725
Speaker 4:  use fish.

384
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:35,085
Speaker 2:  That's what you want. The bleeding edge of Ola technology. You're like, we'll

385
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:38,245
Speaker 2:  at some fish in your doctor's office. Alright. Samsung did announce some

386
00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:41,685
Speaker 2:  other stuff in the TV zone. I'm just gonna read you one

387
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:45,365
Speaker 2:  and here's what I'm gonna do. First I'm just gonna say this word to you and

388
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:49,085
Speaker 2:  I want you to guess what you think this feature is. Oh boy.

389
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:52,765
Speaker 2:  Samsung announced that it's new 24 24 TVs

390
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:56,645
Speaker 2:  will feature in addition to Workout Tracker and techno gym,

391
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:58,125
Speaker 2:  which I think are self

392
00:20:58,315 --> 00:20:59,245
Speaker 4:  Perfectly understandable.

393
00:20:59,245 --> 00:20:59,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. I get those.

394
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:00,845
Speaker 2:  Samsung tail.

395
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:05,025
Speaker 4:  Samsung tail tail. TAIL. Yeah.

396
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:06,625
Speaker 4:  Is it an acronym? Nope.

397
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,305
Speaker 5:  Is it like Paw Patrol? Is it like for children?

398
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:11,465
Speaker 4:  Oh, that's good. It's not

399
00:21:11,465 --> 00:21:12,105
Speaker 2:  For children. Okay.

400
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:12,745
Speaker 5:  It's not for children.

401
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:14,745
Speaker 4:  It's like, it's like, okay. This is, this is my,

402
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:16,425
Speaker 2:  It's a series of cops that are dogs.

403
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:17,345
Speaker 4:  It's

404
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:18,425
Speaker 5:  With tails.

405
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:23,185
Speaker 4:  It's it's pet mode for your television. Oh yes. Instead of turning

406
00:21:23,185 --> 00:21:27,025
Speaker 4:  it all the way off and showing art, you show like puppies running

407
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:27,545
Speaker 4:  around. That's

408
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:28,705
Speaker 2:  Good. Or squirrel something. It's wrong

409
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:29,385
Speaker 4:  Dog. It's good.

410
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:31,465
Speaker 2:  It's, it's just dead wrong, but it's

411
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:32,065
Speaker 4:  Good. Okay. Alex, what's

412
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:34,225
Speaker 5:  Your guess? Well, it was Paw Patrol, but it,

413
00:21:34,865 --> 00:21:35,665
Speaker 2:  It's just the Paw

414
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:36,225
Speaker 4:  Patrol. Just

415
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:39,065
Speaker 2:  Paw Patrol. You push the button, dogs come running out and solve crimes.

416
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:39,985
Speaker 4:  It'd

417
00:21:39,985 --> 00:21:41,825
Speaker 5:  Be great. I would love that. Ooh

418
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,825
Speaker 5:  something related to wifi.

419
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:46,665
Speaker 2:  No, no, no.

420
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:48,705
Speaker 5:  HDR. No. I'm gonna start using

421
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:51,145
Speaker 2:  Listing words. Those are just features of the TV

422
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:53,665
Speaker 4:  Bulbs.

423
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:59,185
Speaker 2:  All right. Samsung Tail. Yeah. Enables real time video

424
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:03,105
Speaker 2:  consultation with a vet in the comfort of the user's home. See, we

425
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:06,225
Speaker 2:  were close from basic care tips to advanced advice.

426
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:10,825
Speaker 2:  Dr. Tail has a range of questions covered. Users

427
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:13,945
Speaker 2:  connect with veterinary experts in real time whenever they need. This is

428
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:17,745
Speaker 2:  a startup that Samsung saw at like a Samsung dev day and they're like, yeah,

429
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:21,465
Speaker 2:  Dr. Tail, you're part of The TVs now. And now it's just part of The

430
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:21,905
Speaker 2:  TVs.

431
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:22,745
Speaker 5:  I

432
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:27,625
Speaker 4:  That's so good. That's so good. The most Samsung thing. Do

433
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:31,145
Speaker 4:  you remember when Samsung had all those apps called like milk? Yeah. You

434
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:33,945
Speaker 4:  could get milk music. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just like Samsung sees a weirdly

435
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:36,745
Speaker 4:  named startup and it's like, yes, that's it. Let's do it. That's like a,

436
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:38,105
Speaker 4:  on our gadgets, that's

437
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:41,625
Speaker 5:  A good business model. You just like come up with a startup that's wouldn't

438
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,865
Speaker 5:  make sense. Put a weird name on it and be like, Samsung.

439
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:46,425
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Do you want it? Would you like to bundle this on the

440
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:49,105
Speaker 2:  Android phone? Look, big tech companies, very few of them can buy companies

441
00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:52,185
Speaker 2:  anymore. All right. This is a problem. Lena Khan's really ruin it, unless

442
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:55,785
Speaker 2:  it's Dr. Tail and Samsung tv, in which case she's fine.

443
00:22:56,415 --> 00:23:00,345
Speaker 2:  Last piece of Samsung News, speaking of frame, such a hit, Samsung

444
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,945
Speaker 2:  is expanding the franchise. They've made a frame speaker,

445
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:08,615
Speaker 2:  which I still find utterly perplexing because it's just a

446
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:09,815
Speaker 2:  speaker behind a picture.

447
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:13,735
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's it. I mean, it really is like, imagine you took a

448
00:23:13,735 --> 00:23:14,015
Speaker 2:  Picture

449
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:17,975
Speaker 4:  Bluetooth speaker and just hi it behind a

450
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:18,975
Speaker 4:  painting, is

451
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:19,935
Speaker 2:  What I'm saying. Samsung

452
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,015
Speaker 5:  Did it for you.

453
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:25,095
Speaker 4:  Right. So I'll be honest, I I don't hate this at all. It does

454
00:23:25,095 --> 00:23:28,655
Speaker 4:  not need to exist. Yeah. But I love that it does. It's like IKEA makes some

455
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:31,495
Speaker 4:  of this stuff too, where they're like, what if our lamp was also a sono speaker?

456
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:35,455
Speaker 4:  And I'm like, what if, what if Ikea, it's a great question. It does

457
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:39,295
Speaker 2:  Seem like Samsung has made one turn more

458
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:43,575
Speaker 2:  innovative than Sonos and Ikea in that it appears you

459
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:47,205
Speaker 2:  can pick your own picture in the Samsung frame speaker,

460
00:23:47,695 --> 00:23:51,605
Speaker 2:  which don don't know if you've been following frame technology key

461
00:23:51,605 --> 00:23:54,205
Speaker 2:  element in the analog frame world.

462
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:55,485
Speaker 5:  Huge fan of that

463
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:58,725
Speaker 2:  IQ was like, nah, this is just one, one picture of sparkles. Yeah.

464
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:02,605
Speaker 5:  It was like, do you want it to look like a hotel room in your house all the

465
00:24:02,605 --> 00:24:05,005
Speaker 5:  time? We got you. Let's go.

466
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So that's TV news. It's again, I wouldn't, and

467
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:12,565
Speaker 2:  I'm not saying there's like one standout TV here apart from the transparent

468
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:15,805
Speaker 2:  one. It's not like the year that like plasma TVs were introduced to the year

469
00:24:15,805 --> 00:24:18,765
Speaker 2:  that, you know, OLED kind of broke and we're like, oh, this is the future.

470
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:19,965
Speaker 2:  I do think you're

471
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:22,285
Speaker 4:  Right though that this is like, we're gonna look back at this as like the,

472
00:24:22,285 --> 00:24:24,885
Speaker 4:  oh, this was the year we saw all the mini LED TVs. Yeah.

473
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:27,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And then I think this is the year that TV sizes starts to get bigger.

474
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:31,165
Speaker 2:  And I think that's fascinating. Like if you are running a movie theater chain

475
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:35,125
Speaker 2:  and you're looking at people buying 98 inch TVs for their house, that look

476
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,845
Speaker 2:  really good. don don't know man. What

477
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:37,765
Speaker 5:  Do you put that on though?

478
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:39,965
Speaker 2:  102 inch wall.

479
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:45,685
Speaker 5:  I'm just like, I'm thinking of the furniture situation there. I need a

480
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:49,365
Speaker 5:  m like I basically, for me specifically, I just need a much larger credenza

481
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:51,525
Speaker 5:  to put a TV that big on it. Yeah,

482
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:52,885
Speaker 4:  That sounds right. Yeah.

483
00:24:53,015 --> 00:24:56,365
Speaker 2:  We'll come back next week for the AV Furniture Show. Yeah.

484
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:58,885
Speaker 2:  Houses shop for credentials here

485
00:24:58,885 --> 00:24:59,965
Speaker 5:  In Vegas. Well, for the measuring tape.

486
00:25:00,305 --> 00:25:03,765
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take a break. The frame is a monopoly. All right. I'm

487
00:25:03,765 --> 00:25:07,005
Speaker 2:  just telling you right now. If you are out there, you're a TV maker. Put

488
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,485
Speaker 2:  some competitive pressure on Samsung. This thing needs local dimming tomorrow.

489
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:11,605
Speaker 2:  We'll, right back

490
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:54,685
Speaker 1:  for more details.

491
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:04,725
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Bir has CES one, the Kia connected

492
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:08,165
Speaker 2:  home, gazing out. I don't see Dieter out there with

493
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:08,885
Speaker 2:  Shake.

494
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:10,485
Speaker 4:  My, my fist. We over, we told he was there at some I

495
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,085
Speaker 5:  I a hundred percent saw Dieter out there earlier,

496
00:26:12,235 --> 00:26:15,645
Speaker 2:  Shaking my fist in the direction in the Google booth. Lots of other

497
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:19,125
Speaker 2:  gadgets here at cs. Lots. Alex, you've been paying a lot of attention to

498
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:22,725
Speaker 2:  laptops, monitors the, the gaming gadgets. Yeah.

499
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:25,405
Speaker 2:  What's what's, what's going on in Windows world? Well, gaming

500
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:28,765
Speaker 4:  First of all has been kind of like, weirdly, the story of CES gaming has

501
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:28,925
Speaker 4:  been

502
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:32,365
Speaker 5:  Really here, like used to, you could have one person kind of cover

503
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:36,325
Speaker 5:  gaming stuff reliably. And now it's like, Ooh, Ooh, maybe I need to assign

504
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:37,845
Speaker 5:  more people to cover this next year because,

505
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:38,885
Speaker 1:  And it also kinda felt

506
00:26:38,995 --> 00:26:42,365
Speaker 4:  Like gaming stuff was always sort of off on its own. It was like, here's

507
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:46,085
Speaker 4:  like the gamer section of CES. Yeah. But now it feels like even these, like

508
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:50,125
Speaker 4:  extremely mainstream brands are mostly making gamer

509
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:50,405
Speaker 4:  things.

510
00:26:50,905 --> 00:26:54,805
Speaker 5:  Yes. They all are like HP's doing it and, and, and Dell, and I mean

511
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:58,645
Speaker 5:  they were already doing it, but Lenovo like is even kind of leaning more

512
00:26:58,645 --> 00:27:01,965
Speaker 5:  into their gaming stuff. They, they even introduced another one of those

513
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,365
Speaker 5:  external GPUs that everybody does every couple of years. And we're all like,

514
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:09,125
Speaker 5:  yeah, this will be the year. And it's never the year. But Lenovo was,

515
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:12,165
Speaker 5:  Lenovo was out there doing it. I think they remaining thinking more for professional

516
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:15,845
Speaker 5:  reasons, like using the GPUs for ai. But I think that's also why we're seeing

517
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:19,365
Speaker 5:  more gaming stuff is because you need really powerful GPUs

518
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:22,925
Speaker 5:  for AI and also for gaming. And so it's like interesting.

519
00:27:22,925 --> 00:27:26,045
Speaker 4:  Okay. Yeah. And that would also explain, I guess why it seems like a lot

520
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:29,565
Speaker 4:  of all this gamey stuff is getting slightly less

521
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:32,965
Speaker 4:  gamey. Like my theory with gaming stuff has always been that it's just those

522
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:36,605
Speaker 4:  are the people willing to spend money on fancy things and high end stuff.

523
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:36,765
Speaker 4:  Oh

524
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:38,085
Speaker 2:  No. I have a way Spier take. Oh yeah.

525
00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:39,245
Speaker 4:  What's your spicier take?

526
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:42,605
Speaker 2:  If you wanna make a young person buy a Windows computer, it has to be a gaming

527
00:27:42,885 --> 00:27:42,965
Speaker 2:  computer.

528
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:44,885
Speaker 4:  Yep. Well that's interesting. And that's why

529
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:46,365
Speaker 5:  Like all, all the gaming laptops,

530
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:50,805
Speaker 2:  That's like 25% spicier that needs to be, please direct your emails to Alex

531
00:27:50,805 --> 00:27:51,725
Speaker 2:  Duck Cranz in the recycle.

532
00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:56,045
Speaker 5:  I agree with him. I totally agree with him. But

533
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:59,925
Speaker 5:  no, so we saw like a lot of gaming laptops this year and they were all like,

534
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:04,005
Speaker 5:  I wouldn't feel weird pulling it out at a coffee shop. Like, I'm older now,

535
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:07,085
Speaker 5:  I don't really wanna pull out something and it's got a bajillion lights on

536
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:07,725
Speaker 5:  it. It goes ah,

537
00:28:07,915 --> 00:28:08,645
Speaker 4:  When you turn it on.

538
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:11,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You could hear it from space because it sounds like it's about to go

539
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:15,005
Speaker 5:  into space. I'm trying to like avoid that in my life now. And

540
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:17,565
Speaker 4:  But you still wanna play sick games at the coffee shop. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

541
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:20,245
Speaker 5:  I get it. I still wanna play Boulder's game forever at the coffee shop until

542
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:23,565
Speaker 5:  they ask me politely to leave. And it feels like that's much more possible

543
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:27,165
Speaker 5:  now. One, because the processors have gotten better, the CPUs are a lot better.

544
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:30,765
Speaker 5:  The GPUs have gotten smaller and are are very efficient. The batteries are

545
00:28:30,765 --> 00:28:34,525
Speaker 5:  getting a little bit better. And two, they just are making these

546
00:28:34,555 --> 00:28:38,165
Speaker 5:  laptops and, and thinking about the rest of us. Or more

547
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:41,005
Speaker 5:  specifically, they're thinking about, as I heard over and over and over again,

548
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:44,885
Speaker 5:  this will work really well in your dorm room. And I was like, oh yeah, my

549
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:48,805
Speaker 5:  dorm room. Okay. Mine. No, not mine. Someone's dorm room. Yeah.

550
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:51,445
Speaker 5:  And, and so that, that's really what they're positioning for. It's for the

551
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:55,405
Speaker 5:  college kids who, who are coming in and they don't want like

552
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:59,685
Speaker 5:  an adult, the laptop their parents have. Right. But they also don't necessarily

553
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:03,405
Speaker 5:  want like neon green lights and stuff all over their laptop.

554
00:29:03,515 --> 00:29:05,885
Speaker 4:  They wanna like play games but also take the thing to class.

555
00:29:05,955 --> 00:29:09,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And so we're seeing a lot of laptops. A lot of them have new white

556
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:12,925
Speaker 5:  colorways. That was a big thing for, I think both HP and Legion were both

557
00:29:13,205 --> 00:29:15,925
Speaker 5:  introducing laptops that were like white and they look really, really nice.

558
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:19,245
Speaker 5:  And you can turn the, you can, you know, you've got RGB keyboards and then

559
00:29:19,245 --> 00:29:22,885
Speaker 5:  if you don't want that, you can turn it off. And that just seems really,

560
00:29:22,885 --> 00:29:26,685
Speaker 5:  really nice. But we saw one from Legion, or we saw one from Lenovo. We saw

561
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:30,565
Speaker 5:  one from HP Alienware that the Dell one, they actually,

562
00:29:30,565 --> 00:29:33,165
Speaker 5:  they used to have a really big exhaust fan on the back and they still do

563
00:29:33,165 --> 00:29:37,005
Speaker 5:  for their more powerful ones. But the, the new, the M 16 R two,

564
00:29:37,115 --> 00:29:40,205
Speaker 5:  they got rid of the butt. There's like a big butt on the back of the laptop.

565
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:41,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And they just said, Nope.

566
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:43,285
Speaker 2:  Classic Alienware move. Yeah.

567
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:44,205
Speaker 5:  They like

568
00:29:44,595 --> 00:29:45,565
Speaker 4:  Chop in the butt, chop

569
00:29:45,565 --> 00:29:45,925
Speaker 5:  In the butt.

570
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:46,645
Speaker 4:  Alienware.

571
00:29:46,675 --> 00:29:50,605
Speaker 2:  Well first you add the butt Right. Get, they've got two moves. The CEO's

572
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:54,045
Speaker 2:  like, this is the butt year and then the next year he is like, get rid of

573
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:54,765
Speaker 2:  the butt. but it

574
00:29:54,785 --> 00:29:55,205
Speaker 5:  Really

575
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:57,605
Speaker 2:  Is, it's like, you know, they used to make the iPod like skinny then fat,

576
00:29:57,915 --> 00:30:00,005
Speaker 2:  then wide and narrow

577
00:30:01,545 --> 00:30:02,285
Speaker 4:  And pull it every

578
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:05,045
Speaker 5:  Year. Yeah. It's actually very accurate. That is what happens a lot of times.

579
00:30:05,045 --> 00:30:07,925
Speaker 5:  They're like, the butt got too big, we have to shrink the butt. And so this

580
00:30:07,925 --> 00:30:10,845
Speaker 5:  year they like, they took it completely off. They've still got it for their,

581
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:13,765
Speaker 5:  for their higher end ones, but for like the 40, 70 and below, they were like,

582
00:30:13,765 --> 00:30:16,805
Speaker 5:  we don't actually for the Nvidia 47 and below, they were like, we don't actually

583
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:20,485
Speaker 5:  need to have all of that exhaust. We don't need all that heat and stuff.

584
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:24,485
Speaker 5:  We're fine. You can do enough for gaming. And and that's true. Like most

585
00:30:24,485 --> 00:30:28,125
Speaker 5:  games nowadays aren't as demanding. Like the really popular

586
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:31,005
Speaker 5:  ones, you know, the Fortnite, the Boulders Gate, just not as demanding.

587
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:34,845
Speaker 4:  It feels like after all these years of trying to make like the one laptop

588
00:30:34,845 --> 00:30:38,685
Speaker 4:  that could be all things to all people ultra powerful

589
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:41,445
Speaker 4:  and ultra portable and everything, they're finally finding like a pretty

590
00:30:41,445 --> 00:30:45,285
Speaker 4:  good middle ground. Yes. That isn't for anybody at either side, but actually

591
00:30:45,285 --> 00:30:48,525
Speaker 4:  hits like the middle 80%. Yeah. In a way better way. Yeah.

592
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:52,005
Speaker 5:  And like I consider myself a gamer. I play a lot of video games. I don't

593
00:30:52,035 --> 00:30:55,925
Speaker 5:  want the huge giant laptop. Right. I like, I

594
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:59,245
Speaker 5:  don't wanna carry it. It's super heavy. I don't wanna try to power it. Some

595
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:03,045
Speaker 5:  of the times you can't even bring the chargers on the plane. Like I want,

596
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:06,005
Speaker 5:  I want something that I can play most of my games at reasonable enough. That's

597
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:08,645
Speaker 5:  why I like the Steam Deck. Yeah. That's why it's a really fun device. That's

598
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:12,205
Speaker 5:  why we're seeing a lot more of these like little handheld PCs where you can

599
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:15,885
Speaker 5:  play that. Like the MSI Claw was the new one this time. Right. Which I really,

600
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:19,565
Speaker 5:  really like. Not as much as Sean. Sean loves the MSI Claw.

601
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:23,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But also I, I don't like it because the controls on it. Have

602
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:24,605
Speaker 5:  you seen the controls? I

603
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:25,725
Speaker 2:  Haven't seen it. Okay.

604
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:29,325
Speaker 5:  So Steam like the Steam Deck has the little, the little touch pads and you

605
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:32,685
Speaker 5:  can control it and, and It works like a mouse. Everybody else who's doing

606
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:36,165
Speaker 5:  this right now has just joysticks and, and a dpa. Mm.

607
00:31:36,505 --> 00:31:40,005
Speaker 5:  And it's just not as good. I'm like, part of why I like the Steam Deck is

608
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:42,725
Speaker 5:  I have a bajillion inputs and now it's like, and they're

609
00:31:42,725 --> 00:31:45,085
Speaker 4:  All super customizable. Yeah. So you can do any kind of weird thing you want

610
00:31:45,085 --> 00:31:45,685
Speaker 4:  with your Steam Deck.

611
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:48,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Instead they're now like, okay, what we're gonna do is pack in like

612
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:51,445
Speaker 5:  a little Intel processor. We're gonna make this thing really, really fast

613
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:56,005
Speaker 5:  and not give you super great controls, but you are getting much better displays.

614
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:59,965
Speaker 5:  Like the MSI one, the MSI Claw has like a variable refresh rate.

615
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:04,165
Speaker 5:  It's got a decently sized battery and it's got the, the Hall

616
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:07,605
Speaker 5:  effect joystick. So You don't get the the drift and stuff.

617
00:32:07,835 --> 00:32:10,605
Speaker 2:  Wait, so there's some like Intel processor news, you said that the clause,

618
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:14,805
Speaker 2:  it's got a newer Intel processor in it. Right. Intel's got its new 14th Gen

619
00:32:14,805 --> 00:32:18,365
Speaker 2:  mobile processors here. That's sort of Yeah. They making all these gaming

620
00:32:18,365 --> 00:32:19,245
Speaker 2:  laptops go. They

621
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:22,965
Speaker 5:  Announced it like, I think a week ago, two weeks ago they announced it right

622
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:26,765
Speaker 5:  before CES. Yeah. And it's the new media, like, and they're just really,

623
00:32:26,765 --> 00:32:30,645
Speaker 5:  really good processors. I feel like for the last couple of years, you

624
00:32:30,645 --> 00:32:33,605
Speaker 5:  would always go to an event and everybody would be like, we're gonna make

625
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:37,325
Speaker 5:  really thin laptops next year, like fan free, really cool laptops just like

626
00:32:37,325 --> 00:32:41,205
Speaker 5:  Apple and it's gonna be awesome. And it never happened. Yeah. And now

627
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:44,485
Speaker 5:  it's like, oh no, they can actually do it. Like Meteor Lake gives you these

628
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:48,005
Speaker 5:  really, really thin laptops. It's giving you these really, really cool handheld

629
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:51,845
Speaker 5:  gaming devices where you can actually have a lot of power in a fairly

630
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:55,285
Speaker 5:  small thing and, and still have the good thermals. Because that's also the

631
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:58,885
Speaker 5:  big limitation. Like you can't do really fast gaming if

632
00:32:59,305 --> 00:33:01,205
Speaker 5:  the processor overheats, which it will,

633
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:03,925
Speaker 4:  If your device is on fire, it doesn't play games very

634
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:07,005
Speaker 5:  Well. Yeah. If your hands are melting, holding onto it, that's bad. And,

635
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:10,085
Speaker 5:  and they, they've, they've, it seems like with with Meteor, like they've

636
00:33:10,085 --> 00:33:13,965
Speaker 5:  finally found that balance. And like I'm, we haven't gotten to check out

637
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:15,605
Speaker 5:  a lot of these things. Really

638
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:18,525
Speaker 4:  Interesting. I was gonna feel like I've heard that specific story so many

639
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:21,885
Speaker 4:  times. Yeah. Yeah. And Qualcomm is out here being like, we did it guys. But

640
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:23,965
Speaker 4:  I think it's our batteries last 37 hours.

641
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:27,485
Speaker 5:  I think the difference is typically the laptop makers

642
00:33:28,295 --> 00:33:31,605
Speaker 5:  don't like buy into that hype. Like the proce the Intel will come out and

643
00:33:31,605 --> 00:33:35,485
Speaker 5:  tell you this is a year. And then laptop makers generally will be like, this

644
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:38,005
Speaker 5:  is not the year. We may release like one as like a pity.

645
00:33:38,005 --> 00:33:41,045
Speaker 4:  Right. They'll often run like a whole generation behind. Yeah. Just for that

646
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:43,365
Speaker 4:  reason. Because they're like, we don't trust this new thing. We're, we're

647
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:44,685
Speaker 4:  gonna wait this out a minute. Yeah. Because it doesn't,

648
00:33:44,705 --> 00:33:45,725
Speaker 5:  But they're the ones that are gonna get yelled at.

649
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:46,885
Speaker 4:  Everybody is Yeah. Ready.

650
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:50,245
Speaker 5:  But this year everybody jumped on it. Yeah. Everybody has stuff. They're

651
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:54,125
Speaker 5:  really, really embracing it. So it feels like we're finally like, I think

652
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:57,805
Speaker 5:  it was 20 17 20 18 where I was seeing these super thin laptops

653
00:33:57,905 --> 00:34:01,165
Speaker 5:  and they'd be like, next year this is gonna come out. We're gonna show you

654
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:04,685
Speaker 5:  this for real. And I'm like, cool. And it never happened. And then this year,

655
00:34:04,755 --> 00:34:07,885
Speaker 5:  like it really feels like it's happening. And it's not just with the gaming

656
00:34:07,955 --> 00:34:11,605
Speaker 5:  ones too. It's also like Lenovo's got a new think book, 13

657
00:34:11,765 --> 00:34:15,525
Speaker 5:  XI believe it's called. And it is just like, it's super, super skin thin.

658
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:19,485
Speaker 5:  It only weighs like 2.2 pounds. It's got a magnesium body,

659
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:23,045
Speaker 5:  so it's like stainless magnesium. So it doesn't get

660
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:26,445
Speaker 5:  fingerprints at all. Everything else in the Lenovo booth was covered in fingerprints.

661
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:30,885
Speaker 5:  And that one, that one worked. I was like, Hey, it does work. And it was

662
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:34,205
Speaker 5:  just like, it feels like a toy, but it was a full laptop. And I was like,

663
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:38,205
Speaker 5:  I I just covered this. I just wanna own this laptop now because it is so

664
00:34:38,205 --> 00:34:41,285
Speaker 5:  thin and so light. It was like the old MacBook. Yeah. And it was like, oh

665
00:34:41,285 --> 00:34:42,005
Speaker 5:  it's, it's that.

666
00:34:42,285 --> 00:34:44,365
Speaker 4:  I really hope that's true. 'cause it's like I want that to be true. It's

667
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:47,405
Speaker 4:  to me, running around looking a bunch of these laptops, there's been this

668
00:34:47,405 --> 00:34:51,245
Speaker 4:  sort of normal, normal CES glut of

669
00:34:51,245 --> 00:34:54,485
Speaker 4:  just like weird ideas about laptops. Yeah. Where there's some that they're

670
00:34:54,485 --> 00:34:57,205
Speaker 4:  like, what if we had foldable screens and you saw a Lenovo one that runs

671
00:34:57,205 --> 00:35:00,405
Speaker 4:  Windows and Android and sometimes they're just like, what if

672
00:35:00,775 --> 00:35:04,765
Speaker 4:  everything about the laptop? We just moved six inches to the left and then

673
00:35:04,765 --> 00:35:08,565
Speaker 4:  that was a laptop. But there's also just a bunch of them

674
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,885
Speaker 4:  this year that they're just like, oh no, we just made a better laptop. That

675
00:35:11,885 --> 00:35:15,845
Speaker 4:  is good. Yeah. And it feels like, especially what the last three years, apple

676
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:19,885
Speaker 4:  has just like run away with the best laptop to use every

677
00:35:19,905 --> 00:35:21,685
Speaker 4:  day as a regular person. This

678
00:35:21,685 --> 00:35:25,565
Speaker 2:  Is what I'm saying about the gaming pieces. If you want someone, if you want

679
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:28,485
Speaker 2:  to knock someone off the default of buying a MacBook error,

680
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:32,805
Speaker 2:  you need to show up with video games. Right.

681
00:35:32,815 --> 00:35:36,525
Speaker 4:  Which is I think part of why Apple is now pushing the Mac as a gaming platform.

682
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:39,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Harder than ever because they're trying to undo that a little bit.

683
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:43,365
Speaker 4:  But that only works for the Windows manufacturers

684
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:47,405
Speaker 4:  to the extent that you have also made a pretty good laptop. Yeah. Because

685
00:35:47,555 --> 00:35:50,965
Speaker 4:  like, I'll figure out another way to play games and like Microsoft is doing

686
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:53,725
Speaker 4:  Game Pass, which is gonna be playable on these other devices. So like that

687
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:58,165
Speaker 4:  specific thing is gonna fall apart if these Windows manufacturers can't figure

688
00:35:58,165 --> 00:36:02,085
Speaker 4:  out how to make just like an everyday very good laptop that is also better

689
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:05,445
Speaker 4:  for gaming. And like that is, it's starting to spin back.

690
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:09,205
Speaker 2:  But let ask Alex laptops about the most incredible device here at

691
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:13,005
Speaker 2:  css. It's the Lenovo think book, which I believe

692
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:13,525
Speaker 2:  you've seen.

693
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:15,925
Speaker 5:  I've seen all of the Lenovos. Yeah.

694
00:36:16,095 --> 00:36:19,405
Speaker 4:  Sorry, can I just, can I just stop you real fast? Yeah. It's called the Think

695
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:20,605
Speaker 4:  book plus Gen five Hybrid.

696
00:36:21,525 --> 00:36:23,685
Speaker 2:  Please. It's very important.

697
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:30,165
Speaker 2:  My apologies. The Gen five hybrid family. I'll be releasing this

698
00:36:30,185 --> 00:36:31,405
Speaker 2:  as a notes Gen four can

699
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:31,725
Speaker 4:  Get outta

700
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:35,845
Speaker 2:  Here. As you know, I've always valued the contributions

701
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:39,405
Speaker 2:  of the Gen five hybrid family. I, I meant no disrespect.

702
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,405
Speaker 2:  I have so many Gen five hybrid friends.

703
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:46,885
Speaker 5:  Your best friend is Gen five.

704
00:36:47,235 --> 00:36:50,805
Speaker 2:  It's like, somehow I'm gonna take this joke actually canceling

705
00:36:50,985 --> 00:36:54,965
Speaker 2:  myself. I don know how but it's coming. No, you saw this thing. The Yeah.

706
00:36:55,825 --> 00:36:59,565
Speaker 2:  Gen vibrate. It is literally two computers. It's just two

707
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:03,565
Speaker 2:  computers attached with a hinge. Yeah. Wait, really? Yeah. Yeah. What So

708
00:37:03,745 --> 00:37:07,725
Speaker 2:  it has a Qualcomm processor in the screen and an Intel processor in the base,

709
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,525
Speaker 2:  right? Yeah. Yeah.

710
00:37:08,525 --> 00:37:12,405
Speaker 5:  It's, it's on the base of it is, is just a Windows machine. And then

711
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:15,285
Speaker 5:  the top of it is, is a tablet. And when you pick it up, you're like, oh yeah,

712
00:37:15,285 --> 00:37:18,685
Speaker 5:  that's a tablet up there because it kinda like has that little wobble. It's

713
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:21,725
Speaker 5:  not as bad as sometimes remember the early, the early ones where they put

714
00:37:21,725 --> 00:37:24,485
Speaker 5:  the tablet up and then the, the horrible little keyboard and you'd pick it

715
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:27,605
Speaker 5:  up and you'd be like, I could never use this. It's a little more balanced

716
00:37:27,605 --> 00:37:31,405
Speaker 5:  than that, but it's still got that like, heft to it because it's got a 14

717
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:35,365
Speaker 5:  inch tablet, like in the top of it. And what was interesting was

718
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:39,005
Speaker 5:  you really just like pull it off. You don't, you don't have to press a button.

719
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:41,965
Speaker 5:  You don't have to do anything. You just like grab it and yank because

720
00:37:41,965 --> 00:37:44,845
Speaker 2:  It's its own computer. Yeah. It's its own batteries have two batteries. It's

721
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:44,885
Speaker 2:  got

722
00:37:44,885 --> 00:37:46,085
Speaker 5:  Two batteries. So it's like

723
00:37:46,605 --> 00:37:47,525
Speaker 2:  I, the, this is, I love this product. It's just

724
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:50,285
Speaker 4:  Do you remember the the Microsoft Surface book? Yeah. That was one of those

725
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:53,485
Speaker 4:  things that like, I don't think anyone bought it except for like six people.

726
00:37:53,485 --> 00:37:53,965
Speaker 4:  But those six

727
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:55,805
Speaker 2:  People, people, my niece and nephew had Surface loved

728
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:59,125
Speaker 4:  It. Bizarrely. I was like, that had like a rabid fan base of people. Yeah.

729
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,685
Speaker 4:  Who liked it for exactly that reason. It's like, but

730
00:38:00,685 --> 00:38:04,205
Speaker 2:  The base had a battery and a GPU, right? Yeah. So this made

731
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:08,405
Speaker 2:  this the base of the Lenovo think book plus Gen Fair hybrid. That's

732
00:38:08,405 --> 00:38:11,605
Speaker 2:  fair. It's a Windows computer is just a full on Windows computer.

733
00:38:12,195 --> 00:38:13,205
Speaker 5:  Just a whole one.

734
00:38:14,685 --> 00:38:15,725
Speaker 4:  I actually really love this.

735
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:19,845
Speaker 5:  It's like, it's a weird fun idea. They're like, oh, we

736
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:23,685
Speaker 5:  were, we asked, Hey, can you communicate between the two? Like if

737
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:26,485
Speaker 5:  you're working on something and you pull it off the, pull the the tablet

738
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:30,205
Speaker 5:  off, you can keep working. They're like, no, it's, it's two

739
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:30,685
Speaker 5:  computers.

740
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:31,405
Speaker 2:  It's like a

741
00:38:31,405 --> 00:38:32,965
Speaker 4:  Full Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

742
00:38:33,075 --> 00:38:36,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You will have to transfer all of your files in order to do, it's

743
00:38:36,475 --> 00:38:38,245
Speaker 2:  Fantastic. They didn't build like an app to fake it.

744
00:38:38,245 --> 00:38:40,645
Speaker 5:  They're they're, they're working on that. They're working, they're working

745
00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:43,805
Speaker 5:  on that. There was also like the separating the two is a little difficult

746
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:47,125
Speaker 5:  'cause it's, it's a, it's, it's a sample. It's, it's not ready for release

747
00:38:47,145 --> 00:38:49,925
Speaker 5:  yet. Yeah. They said it's absolutely gonna be better when the, when the thing

748
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:52,445
Speaker 5:  finally comes out. So I'm excited to try that out.

749
00:38:52,445 --> 00:38:53,965
Speaker 2:  Out $2,000, $2,000

750
00:38:53,985 --> 00:38:54,325
Speaker 4:  And somebody

751
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:56,685
Speaker 2:  Computer and they haven't figured out two computers. They haven't figured

752
00:38:56,785 --> 00:38:59,925
Speaker 2:  out the detach. I mean, just read from Alex. She's being nice.

753
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:04,445
Speaker 2:  This is very nice. The converting process was also dead simple. Just yank

754
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:07,645
Speaker 2:  on the tablet until it disengages. The sample version I tried would sometimes

755
00:39:07,755 --> 00:39:09,285
Speaker 2:  need some coaxing to separate

756
00:39:10,835 --> 00:39:11,125
Speaker 4:  Just

757
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:13,965
Speaker 5:  A little. I was like, at one point I was like, Maybe, it just doesn't come

758
00:39:13,965 --> 00:39:16,685
Speaker 5:  off. Maybe like, this isn't the laptop I'm supposed to be looking at.

759
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:18,005
Speaker 2:  Maybe this isn't the Gen five hybrid.

760
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:19,645
Speaker 5:  And then, then the guy came over and was like, no, no

761
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:23,005
Speaker 4:  M like you just gotta want it. Yeah.

762
00:39:23,065 --> 00:39:23,485
Speaker 2:  That's

763
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:25,005
Speaker 5:  Great. And then it worked fine after that. I guess

764
00:39:25,035 --> 00:39:26,565
Speaker 2:  This is a classic CS product. Yeah.

765
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:30,045
Speaker 4:  It was as somebody who like rode really hard for the Asus

766
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:34,085
Speaker 4:  transformer lineup Yeah. For years. Where you could dock your phone

767
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:37,645
Speaker 4:  into a tablet and then dock that tablet into a keyboard and it was just all

768
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:40,485
Speaker 4:  the devices all at once. Yeah. I'm so happy this thing exists. This

769
00:39:40,485 --> 00:39:44,445
Speaker 2:  Is CSS exists again to sell TVs to the unwitting masses

770
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:48,565
Speaker 2:  and also to have the Motorola, what was it? The Axiom, the Atrix

771
00:39:49,015 --> 00:39:50,965
Speaker 4:  Atrix. The greatest phone of all to

772
00:39:51,495 --> 00:39:55,165
Speaker 2:  Which they had a laptop in the open. Oh, what? It's so bad. And the, the

773
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:59,045
Speaker 2:  transformer and then this guy just, if you can shove two

774
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:02,125
Speaker 2:  computers into one computer Yes. CSS is the place for you.

775
00:40:02,325 --> 00:40:05,085
Speaker 4:  I was describing CES to somebody this morning as half

776
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,805
Speaker 4:  just a place to show off things that Best Buy might want to buy.

777
00:40:09,915 --> 00:40:12,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And then half just companies saying, is this anything?

778
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:18,325
Speaker 4:  It's, it's just, they're just like, V song wrote a whole thing

779
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:22,005
Speaker 4:  about like a wood paneled litter box that will also weigh your cat. It's

780
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:25,685
Speaker 4:  like, that is the most, is this anything gadget I've seen in forever?

781
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:29,365
Speaker 4:  And I love CSS for that. I have a I have a question you just walk by and

782
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:31,325
Speaker 4:  it's people who are like, I'm from France. Is this anything?

783
00:40:32,355 --> 00:40:36,245
Speaker 2:  Does it weigh your cat before and after? Like given the nature

784
00:40:36,265 --> 00:40:37,205
Speaker 2:  of a litter box? That's

785
00:40:37,205 --> 00:40:38,365
Speaker 4:  A really good question. Mm.

786
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:42,205
Speaker 2:  By all accounts, you're, you could also back into weighing something else,

787
00:40:42,215 --> 00:40:43,045
Speaker 2:  right? Know

788
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:45,085
Speaker 4:  That's a really good question.

789
00:40:45,645 --> 00:40:46,885
Speaker 2:  I don't know what that data iss for.

790
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:47,565
Speaker 4:  Why

791
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:50,925
Speaker 5:  Would you need I just don't, her cat's apparently too large to use it.

792
00:40:51,275 --> 00:40:53,165
Speaker 4:  Samsung tail will tell you my

793
00:40:53,165 --> 00:40:54,205
Speaker 2:  Apologies. She's

794
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:55,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. She's gonna be old enough. Samsung tail.

795
00:40:56,275 --> 00:40:59,565
Speaker 2:  Okay. So. I. Wanna ask about two more things every year? Razer usually

796
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:00,205
Speaker 5:  They do a thing.

797
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:03,845
Speaker 2:  They do a thing, right? It's like a project, da da. but it seems like they're

798
00:41:03,845 --> 00:41:04,805
Speaker 2:  pretty chill this year. Pretty

799
00:41:04,805 --> 00:41:08,765
Speaker 5:  Chill. They did have like a, a pad that you can like sit on for your seat

800
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:11,205
Speaker 5:  and it will like kick you in the butt when you play video games.

801
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:14,485
Speaker 4:  You would say it's it's a haptic cushion. Yeah. I think they called it. Yeah.

802
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:14,725
Speaker 4:  And

803
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:18,485
Speaker 5:  This Sean, Sean was kind of impressed by it. He was like, this is fun. But

804
00:41:18,715 --> 00:41:21,365
Speaker 5:  that, that technology's been around for a while. Like a lot of people have

805
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:25,485
Speaker 5:  done that before. And as with a lot of these Razer CES things,

806
00:41:25,515 --> 00:41:27,005
Speaker 5:  they, they never come to fruition.

807
00:41:27,005 --> 00:41:28,645
Speaker 2:  They're very good at getting attention. Yeah,

808
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:31,765
Speaker 5:  They're very, I mean I love it. This anything. Yeah. Like the year they brought

809
00:41:31,765 --> 00:41:34,890
Speaker 5:  in the Razer laptop and it had three screens and I was like, next year this

810
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:35,965
Speaker 5:  is gonna exist. It never.

811
00:41:36,425 --> 00:41:37,005
Speaker 2:  No. All

812
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:39,445
Speaker 4:  Right. Speaking of things you'd love to take into chemistry class. Yeah.

813
00:41:40,635 --> 00:41:40,925
Speaker 4:  Hell

814
00:41:40,925 --> 00:41:44,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And then there's a Samsung flip phone called the Flip Bull.

815
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:45,725
Speaker 2:  What is this called

816
00:41:45,755 --> 00:41:48,725
Speaker 4:  Once again Eli? I am in the position of having to correct you on very important

817
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:52,565
Speaker 4:  naming things. There are two new Samsung display

818
00:41:52,715 --> 00:41:56,645
Speaker 4:  folding screens. I am on the record as I believe flip phones are

819
00:41:56,645 --> 00:42:00,205
Speaker 4:  the future. And folding phones are mostly stupid. Samsung has two new flip

820
00:42:00,205 --> 00:42:03,845
Speaker 4:  phone concepts, both of which basically go not quite

821
00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:06,525
Speaker 4:  360 degrees 'cause it runs into each other. but it like folds all the way

822
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:09,925
Speaker 4:  open one. It's called the flex in and out

823
00:42:10,705 --> 00:42:14,655
Speaker 4:  all one word. Yeah. And the other is called we should, we

824
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,295
Speaker 4:  should talk about this.

825
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:16,415
Speaker 2:  The

826
00:42:16,415 --> 00:42:18,415
Speaker 4:  Other one is either called the Flex Lipel.

827
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:19,575
Speaker 2:  Okay. Or

828
00:42:19,595 --> 00:42:20,095
Speaker 4:  The Flex

829
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:23,415
Speaker 2:  Lipel. I just wanna point out that Flip is a better name. It

830
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,655
Speaker 5:  Is a hundred is a better name. Better.

831
00:42:25,095 --> 00:42:28,215
Speaker 4:  It is, I believe a port manto of the words light and simple.

832
00:42:28,835 --> 00:42:29,055
Speaker 2:  Oh

833
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:32,975
Speaker 5:  No. So lip bulb has to be it because lip bulb's hysterical.

834
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:36,695
Speaker 4:  It does have to be lip bulb. Yeah, you're right. Lips. Better bulb sounds

835
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:38,895
Speaker 4:  more like a medical condition that you'd have. It's not better.

836
00:42:38,955 --> 00:42:39,175
Speaker 5:  But

837
00:42:39,175 --> 00:42:40,975
Speaker 2:  Like lip bulb sounds like a medical condition

838
00:42:41,755 --> 00:42:42,175
Speaker 4:  Doctor.

839
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:46,495
Speaker 5:  Lip bulb like is what you take for your heart lips. Like the thing you get

840
00:42:46,495 --> 00:42:47,375
Speaker 5:  diagnosed with.

841
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:50,175
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think that's right. but it, these things are like,

842
00:42:51,475 --> 00:42:55,095
Speaker 2:  It also rhymes with something. Yeah. It out there. But just acknowledge,

843
00:42:55,395 --> 00:42:55,775
Speaker 2:  we all

844
00:42:55,775 --> 00:42:58,735
Speaker 5:  Know risk getting diagnosed when you have lip. Okay.

845
00:43:00,515 --> 00:43:02,335
Speaker 5:  We all know what part of the body's getting diagnosed.

846
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:08,455
Speaker 2:  We got David, we broke David. We do, no, it's day one of the CSS show. We

847
00:43:08,455 --> 00:43:09,095
Speaker 2:  broke David Pierce.

848
00:43:10,765 --> 00:43:11,055
Speaker 2:  It's

849
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:11,935
Speaker 4:  Gone. I just,

850
00:43:12,595 --> 00:43:14,495
Speaker 2:  But so you, you like the phones as much as

851
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:17,375
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You, you like them? The L-I-P-L-E?

852
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:21,455
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Just again, it's like on the in is this anything

853
00:43:21,505 --> 00:43:25,375
Speaker 4:  scale? Everybody comes every year to CES. Yeah. And

854
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:29,295
Speaker 4:  it's just like, look at this crazy thing. We made a screen do LG has a

855
00:43:29,295 --> 00:43:33,055
Speaker 4:  big booth of the bending oles. The competition for like

856
00:43:33,165 --> 00:43:35,855
Speaker 4:  wildest array of screens this year is kind of a bummer

857
00:43:36,295 --> 00:43:38,775
Speaker 2:  Actually. Yeah. Yeah. They really toned it down. LG and Samsung have really

858
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:39,535
Speaker 2:  toned it down. Yeah.

859
00:43:39,735 --> 00:43:43,535
Speaker 4:  Normally they're just like, we have a wave of 600 televisions. Yeah.

860
00:43:43,605 --> 00:43:47,535
Speaker 4:  That you can walk through. And this year LGS thing was just like don

861
00:43:47,535 --> 00:43:50,775
Speaker 4:  don't know. 20 of the transparent TVs that just move back and forth. Not

862
00:43:50,855 --> 00:43:50,975
Speaker 4:  a

863
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:52,255
Speaker 5:  Single tunnel. Not that cool.

864
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:52,775
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah.

865
00:43:52,775 --> 00:43:56,535
Speaker 4:  Very exciting. And So I. Think Samsung is doing stuff with phones

866
00:43:56,535 --> 00:43:59,175
Speaker 4:  that I continue to think is really interesting. And part of the appeal of

867
00:43:59,175 --> 00:44:02,975
Speaker 4:  something like this is that because it can fold all the way around,

868
00:44:03,275 --> 00:44:07,135
Speaker 4:  you don't need an outside screen and an inside screen, which could in

869
00:44:07,135 --> 00:44:10,335
Speaker 4:  theory make this thing cheaper and easier to manufacture.

870
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:14,575
Speaker 2:  What? But then what happens to the inside when you unfold it,

871
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:16,215
Speaker 4:  It becomes the outside. So

872
00:44:16,215 --> 00:44:16,735
Speaker 2:  It's just nothing.

873
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:21,935
Speaker 5:  You can customize it. Yes. Beautiful pictures of will. I am in this Mercedes.

874
00:44:22,895 --> 00:44:26,775
Speaker 2:  I do. And we'll, we'll talk about this on Thursday. Alex is doing some

875
00:44:26,775 --> 00:44:30,575
Speaker 2:  important foreshadowing here. Yes. Will. I am wrote a song about infotainment

876
00:44:30,575 --> 00:44:32,645
Speaker 2:  systems css. Everybody.

877
00:44:32,705 --> 00:44:35,645
Speaker 4:  We have until Thursday to figure out a fair use way to play the whole song

878
00:44:35,705 --> 00:44:36,485
Speaker 4:  on The Verge cast.

879
00:44:37,585 --> 00:44:40,845
Speaker 2:  All right. We gotta take a break. We, we should talk about the vision pronouns.

880
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:43,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah, we should. It did hit this week. We'll be back. We'll talk about that

881
00:45:26,355 --> 00:45:27,175
Speaker 1:  for more details.

882
00:45:32,965 --> 00:45:36,745
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. CSS Day one day.

883
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,505
Speaker 2:  It's day one. One-ish. Yesterday was day zero. Yeah.

884
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:40,345
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's right.

885
00:45:40,745 --> 00:45:42,825
Speaker 2:  I get this wrong every year. I've been coming here. This is like my 15th

886
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:46,465
Speaker 2:  year and I still don't quite know what day of the show it is. I think it's

887
00:45:46,465 --> 00:45:50,345
Speaker 2:  day one. Lots to talk about css. We've got another show coming later

888
00:45:50,345 --> 00:45:53,985
Speaker 2:  this week with all the rest of it. There's still news happening. We should

889
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:57,705
Speaker 2:  end though this episode by talking about the thing that didn't happen

890
00:45:57,705 --> 00:46:01,665
Speaker 2:  here. But that will probably dominate the year in tech coverage no

891
00:46:01,665 --> 00:46:03,825
Speaker 2:  matter what the Apple Vision Pro. Yeah.

892
00:46:03,825 --> 00:46:06,945
Speaker 4:  Which is a screen gadget and thus fits, which, just a screen, the rubric

893
00:46:06,945 --> 00:46:08,745
Speaker 4:  of our episode, which is a, it's like mini

894
00:46:08,745 --> 00:46:12,265
Speaker 2:  Screens, the most screens. Right. I heard a rumor. Like I said at the top

895
00:46:12,265 --> 00:46:16,145
Speaker 2:  of the show, people at CSS are just full

896
00:46:16,145 --> 00:46:19,705
Speaker 2:  of speculation over the screens, the Vision Pro, how much this thing costs

897
00:46:19,705 --> 00:46:22,465
Speaker 2:  to build, whether Apple is making any money on it, whether or not making

898
00:46:22,465 --> 00:46:26,345
Speaker 2:  any money on it. So we already knew the price. Yep. Industry

899
00:46:26,345 --> 00:46:28,545
Speaker 2:  should take note from Apple. Apple announced things. They're like, here's

900
00:46:28,905 --> 00:46:32,865
Speaker 2:  a price in a release window. They said early 24 and

901
00:46:32,865 --> 00:46:34,105
Speaker 2:  they meant it. Yeah.

902
00:46:34,105 --> 00:46:34,385
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

903
00:46:34,685 --> 00:46:37,705
Speaker 2:  So they said early 2024 and they meant it end of January. They announced

904
00:46:38,385 --> 00:46:42,105
Speaker 2:  February 2nd, this thing shipping. Yep. 34 point 99.

905
00:46:42,435 --> 00:46:45,945
Speaker 2:  Three 500 bucks for a 256 gigabyte model.

906
00:46:47,175 --> 00:46:50,945
Speaker 2:  Unclear if you need more storage in your face computer. Who

907
00:46:50,945 --> 00:46:51,185
Speaker 2:  knows.

908
00:46:51,405 --> 00:46:55,345
Speaker 4:  To be fair, that's gonna be like four minutes of spatial video as far as

909
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:55,705
Speaker 4:  I can tell.

910
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:59,465
Speaker 2:  Spatial video and iPhone where you can record it right now. Yeah. It's 130

911
00:46:59,495 --> 00:47:02,545
Speaker 2:  megabytes per perman. It's real

912
00:47:02,545 --> 00:47:04,625
Speaker 4:  Big. Yeah, that's, it's not small.

913
00:47:04,765 --> 00:47:06,225
Speaker 2:  That's a, that's a, you know, you

914
00:47:06,225 --> 00:47:10,105
Speaker 4:  Gotta think in TikTok minutes, not like, I see. That's fair. Okay. Real minutes.

915
00:47:10,155 --> 00:47:10,945
Speaker 4:  Right. Yeah.

916
00:47:11,425 --> 00:47:15,195
Speaker 2:  I would say that the press release announcing Vision Pro Deeply

917
00:47:15,305 --> 00:47:19,155
Speaker 2:  Confusing does not have any AR or MR. Apps really

918
00:47:19,155 --> 00:47:22,755
Speaker 2:  mentioned. Apps mentioned in the press release include Fantastical

919
00:47:22,935 --> 00:47:23,515
Speaker 2:  and Slack.

920
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:27,795
Speaker 4:  It really seems like this is an iPad for your face.

921
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:31,965
Speaker 4:  And what we've heard from developers is that Apple

922
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:35,845
Speaker 4:  is going way out of its way to tell them, not to call

923
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:39,565
Speaker 4:  it AR or VR or MR. Or

924
00:47:39,945 --> 00:47:43,165
Speaker 4:  XR or any of the other thousands of things. Like Apple is very specific that

925
00:47:43,165 --> 00:47:47,085
Speaker 4:  these are spatial computing apps. Yeah. And I don't

926
00:47:47,535 --> 00:47:50,805
Speaker 4:  think that's gonna work. I've been wrong about Apple's ability to

927
00:47:51,315 --> 00:47:54,925
Speaker 4:  make things into buzzwords before, but that one doesn't really work for me.

928
00:47:55,585 --> 00:47:58,485
Speaker 4:  but it really does seem like, at least at the beginning, I've been talking

929
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:02,285
Speaker 4:  to developers really for the last six months about this and the number

930
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:06,165
Speaker 4:  of folks that I've talked to who are either sitting it out at the very

931
00:48:06,165 --> 00:48:08,525
Speaker 4:  beginning because they haven't spent enough time with it and aren't sure

932
00:48:08,525 --> 00:48:12,445
Speaker 4:  what to do with it, and don't want to ship a crappy app just to have something

933
00:48:12,445 --> 00:48:16,245
Speaker 4:  there the first day. Or people who are saying basically everything we're

934
00:48:16,245 --> 00:48:19,205
Speaker 4:  doing is based on an iPad app. Anyway, that's kind of the starting point

935
00:48:19,205 --> 00:48:22,925
Speaker 4:  for these Vision Pro apps. We're just gonna ship the iPad app and we'll figure

936
00:48:22,925 --> 00:48:23,685
Speaker 4:  it out from there. Yeah,

937
00:48:23,825 --> 00:48:27,205
Speaker 2:  But I just wanna give you the list. So Apple's own press release, I'm just

938
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:31,085
Speaker 2:  going off very directly. Here's how Apple is communicating about the

939
00:48:31,085 --> 00:48:34,805
Speaker 2:  Vision Pro. They say it's shipping, it's coming out Revolutionary New operating

940
00:48:34,805 --> 00:48:38,725
Speaker 2:  system and user interface vision. oss, you can use your, you pinch, you

941
00:48:38,725 --> 00:48:42,685
Speaker 2:  pinch. So select things. Eye tracking. Eye tracking. What I saw it looked

942
00:48:42,905 --> 00:48:45,525
Speaker 2:  was amazing. Then they're like, you can immerse yourself in environments,

943
00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:49,485
Speaker 2:  which is a straight up VR feature. Yep. Right. That's interesting.

944
00:48:49,505 --> 00:48:52,805
Speaker 2:  The first thing that they tell you about it is that you can put yourself

945
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:56,765
Speaker 2:  somewhere else. So it's a VR headset. A fascinating to consider. Yeah.

946
00:48:56,765 --> 00:48:59,565
Speaker 2:  It's the first thing they say. Then they say, here's all the stuff you can

947
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:03,525
Speaker 2:  do. Bullet list, an infinite canvas for productivity, first

948
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:06,805
Speaker 2:  bullet in the list, fantastical freeform, jig space,

949
00:49:07,405 --> 00:49:11,205
Speaker 2:  Microsoft 365 and Slack. It's like, all right, here's what I'm gonna do.

950
00:49:11,205 --> 00:49:13,885
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna go to Holly Acala and I'm gonna Slack.

951
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:15,725
Speaker 4:  Right.

952
00:49:15,725 --> 00:49:19,125
Speaker 2:  Like if you just read the press release, that's where you land. Yeah. In

953
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:22,285
Speaker 2:  Apple's own messaging on the, it's, I think this is fascinating. Maybe this

954
00:49:22,285 --> 00:49:25,645
Speaker 2:  is the best Slack experience anyone has ever had in their entire life. It's

955
00:49:25,645 --> 00:49:29,165
Speaker 2:  just interesting that this is what they're landing on. Then the ultimate

956
00:49:29,165 --> 00:49:33,005
Speaker 2:  entertainment experience. So, you know, they're very proud of these displays.

957
00:49:33,005 --> 00:49:36,645
Speaker 2:  More than 4K TV for each try Apple TV plus Disney plus max other

958
00:49:36,885 --> 00:49:40,685
Speaker 2:  services on a screen that feels a hundred feet wide. Okay. That's with

959
00:49:40,825 --> 00:49:42,885
Speaker 2:  HDR R video tell you big tv,

960
00:49:43,145 --> 00:49:46,365
Speaker 4:  Big conspiracy theory I have about this, which is that Apple deliberately

961
00:49:46,365 --> 00:49:50,005
Speaker 4:  doesn't mention Netflix because Apple and Netflix are beefing over all the

962
00:49:50,005 --> 00:49:53,605
Speaker 4:  stuff in the Apple TV plus app. You have no evidence for this. That's how

963
00:49:53,605 --> 00:49:54,405
Speaker 4:  I feel. I would believe

964
00:49:54,405 --> 00:49:57,965
Speaker 2:  That a hundred percent users can also enjoy new

965
00:49:57,965 --> 00:50:01,515
Speaker 2:  interactive experiences like Encounter Dinosaurs, VR app.

966
00:50:02,425 --> 00:50:06,085
Speaker 2:  So I'm just, again, I'm just reading their press release. I don't,

967
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:09,405
Speaker 2:  I'm not saying these things are good or bad, I'm just saying if you just

968
00:50:09,475 --> 00:50:12,325
Speaker 2:  read how they're talking about it, they have described to you a VR headset.

969
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:12,845
Speaker 2:  Yep. Yes.

970
00:50:14,665 --> 00:50:18,625
Speaker 2:  Fascinating. Then gaming experiences, access games in the app store, including

971
00:50:18,645 --> 00:50:22,305
Speaker 2:  2 50, 250 titles on Apple Arcade. This is where I think the iPad for your

972
00:50:22,305 --> 00:50:25,305
Speaker 2:  face comes in. Yeah. Because what, what do we know about the Quest? The thing

973
00:50:25,305 --> 00:50:29,055
Speaker 2:  that sells a Quest is games, fundamentally Games and Supernatural,

974
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:33,055
Speaker 2:  which is a fitness game. Yep. That's what the even Meta refers to the

975
00:50:33,095 --> 00:50:36,335
Speaker 2:  Quest as games console. It is by far that you might think the Vision Pro

976
00:50:36,335 --> 00:50:39,615
Speaker 2:  is gonna blow the Quest away, but it is currently the market leader. So it's

977
00:50:39,615 --> 00:50:43,525
Speaker 2:  the thing you compare to Super Fruit Ninja. What the golf, these are

978
00:50:43,635 --> 00:50:47,605
Speaker 2:  iPad games, right? Like Yeah. It's just, I'm just, and then the next one

979
00:50:47,605 --> 00:50:51,205
Speaker 2:  is Memories brought to Life spatial videos and photos. This is fascinating.

980
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:55,165
Speaker 2:  The people I know who've tried this thing say it is very convincing. I'm

981
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:58,125
Speaker 2:  very excited to try it. I've been taking some spatial videos, excited to

982
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:01,005
Speaker 2:  try it when we get our hands on one of these things. But that's limited to

983
00:51:01,005 --> 00:51:04,965
Speaker 2:  people who own an iPhone 15 Pro. Right? So that very like, it

984
00:51:04,965 --> 00:51:08,685
Speaker 2:  mean the thing costs $3,500, I'm assuming that's a pretty Yeah. Big overlap

985
00:51:08,985 --> 00:51:12,885
Speaker 2:  of of Apple customers and then it's the the then it's the stuff, right?

986
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:16,165
Speaker 2:  Spatial FaceTime where you get your avatar you can talk to, but you need

987
00:51:16,165 --> 00:51:19,925
Speaker 2:  two vision pros to pull this off. Fascinating. I mean, if a user is

988
00:51:19,925 --> 00:51:23,165
Speaker 2:  wearing Vision Pro while on FaceTime, they appear as their persona while

989
00:51:23,165 --> 00:51:26,765
Speaker 2:  others joining from Mac ipo, iPad or iPhone appear in a tile. Okay. Like

990
00:51:26,825 --> 00:51:30,565
Speaker 2:  we just have to see this stuff work. But that's still like this is the cutting

991
00:51:30,565 --> 00:51:32,925
Speaker 2:  edge stuff and you can't really use it.

992
00:51:33,475 --> 00:51:33,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

993
00:51:34,275 --> 00:51:37,405
Speaker 2:  Because you yourself will not experience this. Right.

994
00:51:37,405 --> 00:51:38,885
Speaker 4:  Right, right. It's actually possible

995
00:51:38,885 --> 00:51:40,845
Speaker 2:  You'll be the persona to someone else. Right.

996
00:51:41,025 --> 00:51:45,005
Speaker 4:  If you're on a Vision Pro and everybody else is on

997
00:51:46,045 --> 00:51:49,165
Speaker 4:  a different Apple device for face, you get tiles, it's, it's actually not

998
00:51:49,165 --> 00:51:52,805
Speaker 4:  gonna be a great experience. Right. It'll be fine. But like it won't be,

999
00:51:52,815 --> 00:51:56,045
Speaker 4:  again, it's, it's a face iPad. That's what that will feel like. What will

1000
00:51:56,045 --> 00:51:56,445
Speaker 4:  you look

1001
00:51:56,445 --> 00:51:59,565
Speaker 2:  Like? And then that's it by the way. Then, then we get breakthrough design

1002
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:03,125
Speaker 2:  and we can talk about that stuff. But that, in terms of experiences, you

1003
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:05,045
Speaker 2:  can have in the headset, that's Apple's list.

1004
00:52:05,585 --> 00:52:05,805
Speaker 4:  So

1005
00:52:05,995 --> 00:52:07,005
Speaker 7:  IPad stuff and VR

1006
00:52:07,135 --> 00:52:10,765
Speaker 2:  Stuff and it's, yeah. It's just funny that the, the first thing to describe

1007
00:52:10,785 --> 00:52:14,325
Speaker 2:  is you will go somewhere else, totally VR and then they describe

1008
00:52:14,325 --> 00:52:18,205
Speaker 2:  productivity. Then you can play games from the app store and then you,

1009
00:52:18,365 --> 00:52:22,045
Speaker 2:  and then this personas thing. You know, like I, again, I've worn one of these

1010
00:52:22,045 --> 00:52:24,765
Speaker 2:  things. It was very compelling when I wore it. It's the best VR experience

1011
00:52:24,765 --> 00:52:28,285
Speaker 2:  I've ever had. Yeah. But if Apple wants to break through into the spatial

1012
00:52:28,285 --> 00:52:31,525
Speaker 2:  computing and they think the future is augmented reality,

1013
00:52:32,365 --> 00:52:34,885
Speaker 2:  actually very unclear where the augmented reality part of this headset comes

1014
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:35,405
Speaker 2:  in. Yeah.

1015
00:52:35,445 --> 00:52:39,365
Speaker 4:  I think the productivity is probably gonna be the closest thing that we

1016
00:52:39,385 --> 00:52:42,045
Speaker 4:  see there. Yeah. I mean, and one thing I noticed, and again, it's possible

1017
00:52:42,045 --> 00:52:46,005
Speaker 4:  this is just like the way that it's written in the press release is Apple

1018
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:49,845
Speaker 4:  mentions that there are sort of specific

1019
00:52:49,995 --> 00:52:53,925
Speaker 4:  spatial games like Made for the Vision Pro and doesn't say that

1020
00:52:53,925 --> 00:52:57,325
Speaker 4:  about any other app. So it's like, I think there's a decent chance that what

1021
00:52:57,325 --> 00:53:01,085
Speaker 4:  we're gonna get is like fantastical with a different border in

1022
00:53:01,105 --> 00:53:03,485
Speaker 4:  the Vision Pro. And I think that's gonna be a lot of these apps where like

1023
00:53:03,485 --> 00:53:06,925
Speaker 4:  translucent, they're just gonna get rid of the Chrome in their apps so that

1024
00:53:06,925 --> 00:53:10,205
Speaker 4:  it feels more like a floating rectangle. And that's gonna be the Vision Pro

1025
00:53:10,205 --> 00:53:14,005
Speaker 4:  app. Yeah. And I think this question of like, what does a spatial

1026
00:53:14,445 --> 00:53:18,405
Speaker 4:  calendar look like is gonna take a while. And I don't know if that's

1027
00:53:18,405 --> 00:53:22,245
Speaker 4:  a thing people want or if that's worth working on, or if it's gonna be

1028
00:53:22,245 --> 00:53:25,605
Speaker 4:  meaningfully better than an iPad app in front of your face. but it

1029
00:53:25,755 --> 00:53:29,605
Speaker 4:  doesn't seem like anyone has really cracked

1030
00:53:29,605 --> 00:53:33,125
Speaker 4:  that. Yeah. And I think Apple is betting that some

1031
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:36,845
Speaker 4:  combination of FaceTime and just like the interface

1032
00:53:37,065 --> 00:53:39,885
Speaker 4:  is gonna be the killer app for people. Because like to your point, the eye

1033
00:53:40,005 --> 00:53:40,605
Speaker 4:  tracking is awesome.

1034
00:53:41,075 --> 00:53:41,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1035
00:53:41,505 --> 00:53:44,885
Speaker 4:  The pinchy pinch thing, at least in the demos that we've gotten, is fantastic.

1036
00:53:44,915 --> 00:53:48,885
Speaker 4:  Like, it's just fun to use the thing. And I think for at least this

1037
00:53:48,885 --> 00:53:52,765
Speaker 4:  first version of a $3,500 gadget that might get

1038
00:53:52,765 --> 00:53:53,565
Speaker 4:  Apple far enough.

1039
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:56,645
Speaker 2:  So Yeah, my theory is that Apple does not really want people to buy this

1040
00:53:56,645 --> 00:54:00,245
Speaker 2:  one, like at scale, right? They're gonna make 500,000

1041
00:54:00,575 --> 00:54:03,125
Speaker 2:  maybe. I think that's the rumor I heard in terms of like, I was like,

1042
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:03,885
Speaker 5:  That's a lot. It seems like

1043
00:54:03,885 --> 00:54:06,565
Speaker 4:  A lot. That's the thing I've been hearing a bunch this week, is how many

1044
00:54:06,595 --> 00:54:09,725
Speaker 4:  does Apple think it's gonna sell? Yeah. That that's the other number everybody's

1045
00:54:09,725 --> 00:54:09,885
Speaker 4:  talking about.

1046
00:54:09,985 --> 00:54:13,005
Speaker 2:  And the, the thing I heard yesterday is they're actually capped by how many

1047
00:54:13,005 --> 00:54:16,565
Speaker 2:  displays that can be made. We'll see. Right. They, they're, they're the bleeding

1048
00:54:16,565 --> 00:54:20,405
Speaker 2:  edge of display tech. So we'll see. I just think that Apple does

1049
00:54:20,405 --> 00:54:23,805
Speaker 2:  not want this to be a ma this version of this thing to be a mask consumer

1050
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:24,165
Speaker 2:  device.

1051
00:54:24,165 --> 00:54:25,605
Speaker 5:  Right. Because it's, it's a developer's kit. Like

1052
00:54:25,715 --> 00:54:27,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. They just polished it up to Yeah.

1053
00:54:27,485 --> 00:54:31,205
Speaker 5:  That that's why we don't, that's why everything in it is, is kind of weird.

1054
00:54:31,465 --> 00:54:34,405
Speaker 5:  And, and we don't know what the killer app is 'cause they don't know what

1055
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:38,085
Speaker 5:  the killer app is. So they're like, here's our thing. Please don't call it

1056
00:54:38,145 --> 00:54:41,525
Speaker 5:  VR or AR even that, that's what it is. Yeah.

1057
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:45,165
Speaker 5:  And, and I, I get why they're doing that. They, they want to like, they're

1058
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:48,485
Speaker 5:  late to that game and so they don't wanna be, feel like they're late to that

1059
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:51,525
Speaker 5:  game. So spatial computing is the thing and it sounds like it is really,

1060
00:54:51,525 --> 00:54:55,485
Speaker 5:  really cool, but it's also just very clear that they don't know what they're

1061
00:54:55,485 --> 00:54:56,245
Speaker 5:  doing entirely.

1062
00:54:56,755 --> 00:55:00,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And so lemme just tell you what you get for your 3,500 bucks. You get

1063
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:04,805
Speaker 2:  the headset, you get the solo knit band and the dual loop band

1064
00:55:05,075 --> 00:55:08,045
Speaker 2:  sick, which are the headbands put around your head. Appreciate that. A light

1065
00:55:08,045 --> 00:55:11,765
Speaker 2:  seal and two light seal cushions. The light seal seems like a thing that

1066
00:55:11,765 --> 00:55:15,005
Speaker 2:  you gotta to finagle with and get exactly right. 'cause you gotta block out

1067
00:55:15,005 --> 00:55:18,565
Speaker 2:  all light. The Vision Pro cover very important polishing cloth.

1068
00:55:18,775 --> 00:55:19,125
Speaker 2:  Don't

1069
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,925
Speaker 4:  Just skip over. That's, that's like 20 bucks.

1070
00:55:21,315 --> 00:55:25,085
Speaker 2:  It's a lot. Oh yeah. Wow. Free polish cloth. The battery, the USPC

1071
00:55:25,245 --> 00:55:29,045
Speaker 2:  charging cable and the US PC adapter. I think we continually forget

1072
00:55:29,265 --> 00:55:32,285
Speaker 2:  Vision Pro is two and a half hour battery life with an external battery pack

1073
00:55:32,715 --> 00:55:34,805
Speaker 4:  That you wear on in your pocket. Yeah.

1074
00:55:35,405 --> 00:55:38,365
Speaker 2:  Not cable. I, I'm just telling you like, I agree with you. I think this is

1075
00:55:38,365 --> 00:55:40,885
Speaker 2:  a developer kit. I think they need developers to get their hands on this

1076
00:55:40,885 --> 00:55:43,325
Speaker 2:  thing. They need people to start using it. They need to collect some data

1077
00:55:43,655 --> 00:55:47,565
Speaker 2:  about what it's for, why it's, why it exists. And I think that

1078
00:55:47,565 --> 00:55:51,485
Speaker 2:  is just the most, unlike Apple, I've seen any product in quite a while. Even

1079
00:55:51,485 --> 00:55:54,685
Speaker 2:  the watch, which I criticize heavily at the beginning, and it took them three

1080
00:55:54,735 --> 00:55:57,405
Speaker 2:  tries to figure out the watch. Yeah, yeah. And now it's a huge success and

1081
00:55:57,405 --> 00:56:00,085
Speaker 2:  everybody know it's a huge success. But the, the watch was like a shotgun

1082
00:56:00,335 --> 00:56:03,725
Speaker 2:  blast of ideas about what you could do with a computer and your wrist

1083
00:56:04,115 --> 00:56:07,685
Speaker 2:  down to you will flirt with people in school by sending them your heartbeat.

1084
00:56:08,105 --> 00:56:11,805
Speaker 2:  But that was like a complete Johnny Ive thought. Yes. Yeah. Not a

1085
00:56:12,005 --> 00:56:12,445
Speaker 2:  good thought.

1086
00:56:13,075 --> 00:56:13,685
Speaker 4:  It's a fun

1087
00:56:13,685 --> 00:56:16,485
Speaker 2:  Thought. Not a thought that landed anywhere, but he was like, here's what

1088
00:56:16,485 --> 00:56:19,325
Speaker 2:  you're gonna do. You're gonna put your fingers in your wrist, then you're

1089
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:22,245
Speaker 2:  just gonna read your heartbeat and someone else is gonna feel your heartbeat.

1090
00:56:22,785 --> 00:56:25,885
Speaker 2:  And they will know that you want to go to the movies. The

1091
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:29,845
Speaker 4:  Vision Pro is like comparatively a little, is this anything? Yeah. E

1092
00:56:29,915 --> 00:56:30,205
Speaker 4:  that

1093
00:56:30,205 --> 00:56:31,445
Speaker 2:  Way it's, it's got that vibe. Yeah.

1094
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:34,485
Speaker 4:  And I, you know what's weird is there's nothing at CES trying to compete

1095
00:56:34,485 --> 00:56:35,045
Speaker 4:  with it. Like

1096
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,845
Speaker 2:  Around, there's a couple of things. So many ounces, a fake headset that doesn't

1097
00:56:37,845 --> 00:56:38,005
Speaker 2:  exist

1098
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:39,525
Speaker 5:  In real, but that,

1099
00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:43,285
Speaker 4:  That they're just imagining is like a content creation device. Yeah.

1100
00:56:43,315 --> 00:56:47,045
Speaker 4:  It's it's a camera more than it is anything. But then yeah, we saw X reel,

1101
00:56:47,335 --> 00:56:50,885
Speaker 4:  which is making the sort of like AR display glasses.

1102
00:56:51,115 --> 00:56:54,845
Speaker 4:  It's doing more like degrees of freedom and they can see depth and all this

1103
00:56:54,845 --> 00:56:58,285
Speaker 4:  stuff. Like they're pushing towards this thing, but everybody else is still

1104
00:56:58,545 --> 00:57:02,285
Speaker 4:  on this. Like, we're gonna take something that looks passively like glasses

1105
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:05,965
Speaker 4:  and then try to make it more and more powerful over time. No one, at least

1106
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:09,605
Speaker 4:  as far as I've seen, is trying to do the whole swing so far.

1107
00:57:09,845 --> 00:57:13,085
Speaker 5:  I mean, Meta is very clear, like Meta is right.

1108
00:57:13,425 --> 00:57:16,485
Speaker 4:  Oh sure. But Meta's not really here doing stuff either. They're like,

1109
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:19,685
Speaker 5:  I think the thing is Apple, we're, we're looking at it as like, oh is Apple,

1110
00:57:19,865 --> 00:57:22,605
Speaker 5:  why is nobody competing with Apple here? And that's because Apple is late

1111
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,605
Speaker 5:  to the party and Apple has to actually compete

1112
00:57:24,605 --> 00:57:26,565
Speaker 2:  With everyone else. Yeah. Everyone else already launched their failed VR

1113
00:57:26,565 --> 00:57:27,845
Speaker 2:  headsets two years ago. Yeah.

1114
00:57:27,905 --> 00:57:31,885
Speaker 4:  And three and four and five years ago. Yeah. Yeah. But no, and I also think

1115
00:57:31,885 --> 00:57:35,645
Speaker 4:  what I've heard from a bunch of people this week that the fact that the

1116
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:39,245
Speaker 4:  RayBan met up Smart Glasses, the ones that actually look like real glasses

1117
00:57:39,635 --> 00:57:43,245
Speaker 4:  have been such a hit with people is changing. A lot of folks' mind about

1118
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:46,525
Speaker 4:  actually the way to approach this, and I've gotten a lot of confidence from

1119
00:57:46,525 --> 00:57:49,965
Speaker 4:  people over the last couple of months, but even including at this show,

1120
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:53,885
Speaker 4:  who think the Vision Pro is wrong in a way that people don't usually bet

1121
00:57:53,885 --> 00:57:57,685
Speaker 4:  against Apple products and are convinced that if we can take something

1122
00:57:57,915 --> 00:58:01,805
Speaker 4:  that is closer to looking like a normal thing you'd wear out at a

1123
00:58:01,805 --> 00:58:05,325
Speaker 4:  place like CES and not a pair of ski goggles on your face, we can get

1124
00:58:05,675 --> 00:58:09,445
Speaker 4:  that to Powerful faster than Apple can get Division

1125
00:58:09,465 --> 00:58:13,445
Speaker 4:  Pro to like socially cool. Yeah. And I think Apple usually

1126
00:58:13,515 --> 00:58:17,445
Speaker 4:  wins that race, but this is kind of the hardest it has

1127
00:58:17,445 --> 00:58:20,205
Speaker 4:  ever had to try to do that. And I just think it's gonna be so fascinating.

1128
00:58:20,345 --> 00:58:23,965
Speaker 4:  But I am sort of bummed that no one here, like this is the year Samsung should

1129
00:58:23,965 --> 00:58:24,365
Speaker 4:  have been like,

1130
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:27,765
Speaker 2:  There's a rumor that Samsung Google are gonna do's.

1131
00:58:29,225 --> 00:58:32,845
Speaker 2:  It doesn't have local dimming, but it'll show you artwork. Right.

1132
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:36,125
Speaker 2:  Anywhere you want. There's a rumor saying Google and Samsung are gonna do

1133
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,965
Speaker 2:  something again. Yeah, we'll

1134
00:58:37,965 --> 00:58:41,605
Speaker 4:  See, because that went great the last time here. Everybody had one of those.

1135
00:58:42,015 --> 00:58:46,005
Speaker 2:  We've run this, we've run this experiment before maybe we'll

1136
00:58:46,005 --> 00:58:49,765
Speaker 2:  see. But that is, I will say where CSS is great. I love the gadgets. I'm

1137
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:53,525
Speaker 2:  talking about TVs and laptops that are actually two laptops

1138
00:58:53,585 --> 00:58:54,005
Speaker 2:  bolted

1139
00:58:54,205 --> 00:58:54,285
Speaker 4:  Together,

1140
00:58:54,485 --> 00:58:56,045
Speaker 5:  Put 'em together. Exhibit would be so happy.

1141
00:58:57,745 --> 00:59:00,165
Speaker 2:  But I, I suspect we're gonna spend the year talking about the Vision Pro.

1142
00:59:00,325 --> 00:59:04,085
Speaker 2:  I think that's right. Yeah. Because it really, you know, Apple's betting

1143
00:59:04,085 --> 00:59:07,205
Speaker 2:  on it. It's their big new category. A lot of ideas contained in that thing.

1144
00:59:07,205 --> 00:59:10,845
Speaker 2:  And I agree. I think there's something to the fact that the Meta glasses

1145
00:59:11,025 --> 00:59:14,725
Speaker 2:  are doing well and people like them in a way that we, I usually don't see

1146
00:59:14,725 --> 00:59:17,645
Speaker 2:  this. Sean Holser is here. He is taking a lot of videos at a lot of the,

1147
00:59:17,645 --> 00:59:21,365
Speaker 2:  the little events. He's been wearing a phone sort of like on a Chest mount

1148
00:59:21,365 --> 00:59:24,605
Speaker 2:  so he could like show people with his hands and our commenters on TikTok

1149
00:59:24,605 --> 00:59:28,165
Speaker 2:  and all the social platforms are assuming they're, he's taking with the Meta

1150
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:30,565
Speaker 2:  glasses. Oh, interesting. Which is super fascinating. Like they've already

1151
00:59:30,565 --> 00:59:33,605
Speaker 2:  broken into consciousness such that people think that that's the camera he's

1152
00:59:33,605 --> 00:59:37,565
Speaker 2:  using. And we, and like ve in our director is like, nah, that's

1153
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:38,245
Speaker 2:  a iPhone I don.
