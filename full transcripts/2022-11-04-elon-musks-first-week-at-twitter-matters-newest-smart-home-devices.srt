Speaker 5:  update much

16
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,550
Speaker 7:  More important update than Elon.

17
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,870
Speaker 5:  Okay. We have, I don't know that we've ruled out Kara Swer is the weed in

18
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,310
Speaker 5:  the studio culprit? I want, we've

19
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,470
Speaker 6:  Ruled out that Elon Musk is the weed in the studio Like

20
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,430
Speaker 5:  Is that, I mean, he

21
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,350
Speaker 6:  Could be. It seems possible.

22
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,270
Speaker 5:  It's very possible. Where in his head, I'll tell you that much

23
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,430
Speaker 5:  we, So I'm not saying it's conclusively not Kara. Yeah, but I will say that

24
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,790
Speaker 5:  we walked in today, Kara has not been in the studios. I don't even know if

25
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,310
Speaker 5:  Kara's in the studio last time, but I know I've been in the office all day.

26
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,030
Speaker 5:  I've not seen her. Yeah, I think she lives in DC so she's not here.

27
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,710
Speaker 5:  Not here often. Kay. Still open. Yeah. Still a suspect of interest,

28
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,230
Speaker 7:  Right? We haven't ruled

29
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,910
Speaker 5:  Her out, but it smells like weed again. It

30
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,910
Speaker 7:  Does Smells a lot like wheat. Having a

31
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,150
Speaker 5:  Great time. And today we are informed that we share an air duct with another

32
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,030
Speaker 5:  team at the company. I will not say who the team is. I think the

33
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,030
Speaker 5:  listener should try to guess.

34
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,590
Speaker 7:  Please send

35
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,390
Speaker 5:  Us once you guess. Yeah. It is very obvious it

36
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,230
Speaker 5:  will land. It will click which group and

37
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,550
Speaker 5:  not even accusing. We don't know for sure.

38
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,150
Speaker 7:  We don't know. It could be Recode. It's,

39
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,710
Speaker 5:  Yeah, just think about it. What, what it's,

40
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,750
Speaker 6:  It's the Packer's blog. They're dealing with a lot right now.

41
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,920
Speaker 8:  Be even alone.

42
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,240
Speaker 5:  That's just more of a boo situation. That's a brown liquor problem.

43
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,720
Speaker 5:  That's not a weed problem. All right. There's a lot going on in the world,

44
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,560
Speaker 5:  Elon. It's his first week at Twitter. It has been

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,280
Speaker 5:  absolutely chaotic. On the other happier side of tech news,

46
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,040
Speaker 5:  it's matters launch day. Speaking of weed matter, the smart Home standard

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,600
Speaker 5:  is launching currently in Amsterdam. Our own times, their place,

48
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,640
Speaker 5:  they are just turning lights on and off, just stoned outta their

49
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,160
Speaker 5:  mind to all corners of the earth. Jen Tooey and Thomas Ricker are actually,

50
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,400
Speaker 5:  Thomas lives in Amsterdam. Jen flew over there. We got lots of news. The

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,640
Speaker 5:  matter event we should talk about. It's pretty exciting. I, we got a bunch

52
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,560
Speaker 5:  of ga talk about, Let's start though with Elon speaking of Brown

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,440
Speaker 5:  Liquor. Let's start with Elon. Take a shot, Alex. It's been his first

54
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,320
Speaker 5:  week. It's been chaotic. You kind of blew up the world over the weekend

55
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,560
Speaker 5:  by reporting that Twitter blue would cost $20. Our friend Casey New had reported

56
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,200
Speaker 5:  it would cost four and then it landed at eight. It sounds like

57
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,920
Speaker 5:  layoffs are happening maybe as soon as tomorrow for half the workforce. What's

58
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,160
Speaker 5:  the latest?

59
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,400
Speaker 9:  Yeah. So layoffs will most likely have started by the time

60
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,200
Speaker 9:  this podcast drops. If not, I would expect soon after.

61
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,280
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it's been, to sum it up, you know, just chaotic inside Twitter, I

62
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,280
Speaker 9:  would say the current vibe is perfectly encapsulated by the fact that Elon

63
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,160
Speaker 9:  Musk has almost 90 direct reports inside Twitter's internal

64
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,920
Speaker 9:  directory. Which, you know, I think

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,840
Speaker 9:  speaks to just the fact that he's fired everyone that would be below him.

66
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,640
Speaker 9:  That's super funny. Kept them. Yeah, you know, the, it started

67
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,520
Speaker 9:  with me having to Google Lima on Friday, which

68
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Speaker 9:  was very unfortunate. Don't recommend that. And then

69
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,880
Speaker 9:  throughout the weekend it became apparent that Musk's first

70
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,520
Speaker 9:  big project was going to be rehauling verification on Twitter.

71
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,560
Speaker 9:  And I'd heard that he was making people stay in the office over the weekend

72
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,360
Speaker 9:  to get a demo together to show him of this new idea. And

73
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,520
Speaker 9:  I, I really do think that the price, the team building the

74
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,000
Speaker 9:  feature found out that the final price was gonna be $8

75
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,280
Speaker 9:  by him tweeting it to Stephen King. I don't like that's

76
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,200
Speaker 9:  Well, so yeah, I think Stephen King props to

77
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,160
Speaker 9:  my guys for pointing this out, who also testified in the

78
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,440
Speaker 9:  big, that was at the Simon and Schuster merger trial.

79
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah, Penguin Random

80
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,760
Speaker 9:  House. Yeah, Penguin Random House. You know, Stephen King said, you know,

81
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,720
Speaker 9:  basically fuck this. Like I'm not gonna pay $20. After we reported that Twitter

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,320
Speaker 9:  was planning on making it $20. And then Elon responded and was like, How

83
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,240
Speaker 9:  about eight? And then the next day said eight. So Stephen

84
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,960
Speaker 9:  King had a product at Twitter. Congrats. Yeah.

85
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,160
Speaker 9:  Wonderful. It's, it's actually, it's just remarkable. Like people, employees

86
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,920
Speaker 9:  are literally just looking to Musk's Twitter account to see what their next

87
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,240
Speaker 9:  directive is gonna be and how their product is actually gonna work, which

88
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,600
Speaker 9:  is, is just an amazing time we live in. Meanwhile, they're all sprinting

89
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,200
Speaker 9:  to get this new Twitter blue subscription product out the door by

90
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,640
Speaker 9:  this coming Monday, November 7th, or else they're all going

91
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,080
Speaker 9:  to be fired and they all may be fired or half them fired

92
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,080
Speaker 9:  anyway by Saturday or Friday when this comes out, since he's about to cut

93
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,160
Speaker 9:  estimate it around half of the company, almost 4,000 people on Friday. So

94
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,320
Speaker 9:  yeah, that's the lay of the land.

95
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,320
Speaker 7:  Is this push to, to get it all like Twitter, blue, completely

96
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,040
Speaker 7:  redone by the seventh. Is this like, is the intent to make

97
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,960
Speaker 7:  people so miserable they quit so he doesn't have to lay them off? Is

98
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,920
Speaker 7:  the intent to make them fail so that he can be like, that's why

99
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,800
Speaker 7:  you're fired. Like is that kind of the calculus there before the layoffs?

100
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,240
Speaker 9:  You know, Alex, only Elon can see the mind of Elon.

101
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,200
Speaker 7:  Has he tweeted anything on the on the Well,

102
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,960
Speaker 5:  No, if you're, if you're just like a Twitter engineer, you got like an engineering

103
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,600
Speaker 5:  brain. Yeah. Just a little game theory. Yeah. There's, you cannot be

104
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,080
Speaker 5:  miserable enough to quit at this moment in time. There's no amount of misery

105
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,600
Speaker 5:  that would make you walk away from a severance that is coming if you

106
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,400
Speaker 9:  Get, Yeah, I mean this is already, this is already super sadistic, this whole

107
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,640
Speaker 9:  process. I think it's more to send a message, right? Like I reported that

108
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,560
Speaker 9:  literally the first day he took over, he was like redirect, logged out,

109
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,320
Speaker 9:  homepage to explore and had that pushed through the code freeze. It's just

110
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,080
Speaker 9:  kind of like a, I'm here and we're gonna start changing things that we

111
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,040
Speaker 9:  thought we would never change. Right? That was a hugely political thing before,

112
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,920
Speaker 9:  Talked about it in a story of the weekend. Anyway. And I think

113
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,440
Speaker 9:  the same thing with Blue. It's more to just show A, we can do stuff

114
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,360
Speaker 9:  fast if we're forced to like on point,

115
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,600
Speaker 9:  and B, I'm showing you where my priorities lie. So this is the big

116
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,400
Speaker 9:  project that everyone's working on. The, the lead PM of this literally tweeted

117
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,360
Speaker 9:  that she was sleeping on the floor in the conference room the other day.

118
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,360
Speaker 9:  Hashtags sleep where you work. And so I, I think it's just to

119
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
Speaker 9:  say this is a new company. I mean, Twitter is a company that has had a monthly

120
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,000
Speaker 9:  day of rest for the last two years, which Musk also

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,680
Speaker 9:  got rid of. Aww. And it is just like the opposite

122
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,560
Speaker 9:  of a musk company. Like this is the most dramatic cultural

123
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,680
Speaker 9:  reset of a company that I've ever witnessed. And it's happening in real

124
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,640
Speaker 9:  time and less than a week. And that's probably also why he

125
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,880
Speaker 9:  fired the entire executive team is he's just saying like, We're not, we're

126
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,280
Speaker 9:  changing things.

127
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,040
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That to me is really one of the more sort of

128
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,600
Speaker 6:  instructive parts of all this is, this is also in keeping with how Elon Musk

129
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,240
Speaker 6:  does business. Like any of the people who have come over to Twitter from

130
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,160
Speaker 6:  Tesla, I guarantee you this is not phasing them. This

131
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,640
Speaker 6:  is just how it works. He says in insane things that are probably impossible,

132
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,920
Speaker 6:  pushes everybody like crazy to make it work. And if it doesn't, there's hell

133
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,440
Speaker 6:  to pay and or he just tweets a new crazy thing and then everybody chases

134
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,920
Speaker 6:  that. This is just like, this is the price of doing business with Elon Musk.

135
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,880
Speaker 6:  And it, it's in a strange way. Like part of it is, it's incredible

136
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,760
Speaker 6:  how quickly he has pulled this off. Like the sheer force of personality to

137
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,040
Speaker 6:  just roll into the building and be like, What's up? Everything is different.

138
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,960
Speaker 6:  Ready Go is like, yeah, deeply messed up. But also in a certain way, like

139
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,760
Speaker 6:  kind of impressive.

140
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,840
Speaker 9:  I will say that I've had several Twitter employees compare this to

141
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,760
Speaker 9:  like the Trump White House and the, the transition team there.

142
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,760
Speaker 9:  And I think that's a very apt analogy. I mean, the guy

143
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,440
Speaker 9:  that Musk is leaning on to help him come up with the layoff plan, his last

144
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,120
Speaker 9:  name is Sax. I mean, you couldn't write this as a Hollywood

145
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,920
Speaker 9:  script any better. And to what David was saying before, there

146
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,600
Speaker 9:  are dozens of people from Tesla, the boring company,

147
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,720
Speaker 9:  Neural link, including Musk's own cousin, other aides,

148
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,800
Speaker 9:  other advisors, VCs in the building

149
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,680
Speaker 9:  that, you know, are helping Musk do all this. And that's been very jarring

150
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,040
Speaker 9:  for Twitter employees too, is to be like, Wait, my fate is gonna be dictated

151
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,120
Speaker 9:  by the all in podcast.

152
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,520
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So there's two things there. One, just to, to

153
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,000
Speaker 5:  David's point. How many times have we seen a company get a new ceo?

154
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,480
Speaker 5:  How many times have we talked to new leadership at companies? Even

155
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,160
Speaker 5:  when we have done new things, like what's the first thing happens? Like the

156
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,920
Speaker 5:  leader is like, I need to listen to everybody. Everyone needs to feel hurt.

157
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,200
Speaker 5:  I just need to go make everyone comfortable. And then we'll start doing changes.

158
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,200
Speaker 5:  Like, and then we'll destroy you. I, I swear to God, there's a new CEO

159
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,400
Speaker 5:  playbook that's like the first, here's what you first month, you just tell

160
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,360
Speaker 5:  everyone you're listening. Even if you're not. Yeah. You just say loudly.

161
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,400
Speaker 5:  Like, first I need to listen to everyone. Yeah. It's literally called the

162
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,800
Speaker 5:  listening tour. You do the listening tour, it's what you do. You're like,

163
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,720
Speaker 5:  walk around, you're like, I'm listening to you. And in the back of every

164
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,600
Speaker 5:  CEO's head it's like, to see if I'll fire you, but you do it.

165
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,560
Speaker 5:  There's no listening at Elon. Right? Like he, he's been paying

166
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,440
Speaker 5:  attention. He's addicted to Twitter. The thing I keep saying is like, it's

167
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,320
Speaker 5:  like someone addicted to cigarettes was given a cigarette factory and

168
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,240
Speaker 5:  they don't realize that no one else is addicted to cigarettes the way that

169
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,600
Speaker 5:  they are addicted to cigarettes. And they're like, I have, I've been having

170
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,520
Speaker 5:  thoughts about cigarettes for a long time and we're gonna

171
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,320
Speaker 5:  do them all right, all of them this week. It's just something

172
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,840
Speaker 5:  that's hilarious. And then the, the second part of that is this like kitchen

173
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,240
Speaker 5:  cabinet of his, which is mostly comprised

174
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,800
Speaker 5:  of investors, not people who do things. And yes,

175
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,240
Speaker 5:  we know there's a bunch of engineers and people from his other companies,

176
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,160
Speaker 5:  but the public face of the decisions is a bunch of

177
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,520
Speaker 5:  finance people. Yeah. And it's just very, it, it's like

178
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,480
Speaker 5:  someone finally allowed them to play with the Legos and

179
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,000
Speaker 5:  they're like, Alright, here's what you do. You make a huge tower

180
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,560
Speaker 5:  with a skinny bass. I've been thinking about these Legos for a long time

181
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,720
Speaker 5:  and they have no idea what they're doing because they're just

182
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,600
Speaker 5:  the money. Yeah. And that to me is like the funniest part of this whole

183
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,400
Speaker 5:  thing is all these VCs are like, we need a team, we need a product,

184
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,800
Speaker 5:  we need founders, we need people who know the product. And they

185
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,840
Speaker 5:  themselves are not taking their own cliche advice.

186
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,640
Speaker 9:  Money is important because Musk has a, I think he's on the hook

187
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,560
Speaker 9:  for about a billion a year in interest payments alone on this Twitter deal.

188
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,400
Speaker 9:  And interestingly, the rumor I keep hearing is that internally there's a

189
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,880
Speaker 9:  push to cost save about a billion a year in opex between

190
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,840
Speaker 9:  all the cuts that are about to come. And they're, they're scrutinizing

191
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,720
Speaker 9:  every vendor contract their cloud spend everything to cut

192
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,320
Speaker 9:  costs. So yeah, it is like a, it is a thing of

193
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,240
Speaker 9:  financial engineering that is the Twitter problem on day one. And

194
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,680
Speaker 9:  then the product stuff will happen and he wants to obviously move quickly

195
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,840
Speaker 9:  on the product stuff, but he's gotta first make it work financially.

196
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,600
Speaker 5:  So $8 a month, there's currently, there's what, 400,000

197
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,040
Speaker 5:  verified users. So we can tell that number comes from

198
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,080
Speaker 5:  the number of people that the at verified account follows. I'm Twitter,

199
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,560
Speaker 9:  Which is, which is automatic and is everyone who's verified. I've confirmed

200
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,040
Speaker 9:  that. Okay. I think I, I have a, So I'm really, I want to know what you guys

201
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,600
Speaker 9:  think about this verification thing and if everyone's gonna pay. I mean,

202
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,960
Speaker 9:  of course we are, but like

203
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,160
Speaker 5:  I will, if you, That's the cigarette factory talk. You don't have

204
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,440
Speaker 5:  to smoke cigarettes, Alex, you don't have to do it.

205
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,920
Speaker 7:  You can quit, get a patch.

206
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,720
Speaker 9:  I, I get all of the blow back to this and you know, when I published the

207
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,560
Speaker 9:  first, you know, that they were contemplating 20, it just was like people

208
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,240
Speaker 9:  freaked out. Blue check Twitter went on red mode.

209
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,200
Speaker 9:  I, I think people are underestimating the incentives to,

210
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,040
Speaker 9:  to buy into this because it's not just that you have a check mark. The way

211
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,000
Speaker 9:  that Twitter verification has worked, and I don't think people get this,

212
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,320
Speaker 9:  is that if you're verified, you're actually, it's, it's a quality signal

213
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,160
Speaker 9:  in Twitter's algorithms. So you're boosted more in the timeline. You're boosted

214
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,920
Speaker 9:  in replies. There's that verified filter that we have if we're check mark

215
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,600
Speaker 9:  where we can see verified responses and the next update, that verified tab

216
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,480
Speaker 9:  is gonna become the first tab in the notifications tray. So basically he's

217
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,680
Speaker 9:  gonna just bifurcate the audience. Yeah. And I think people are gonna be

218
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,960
Speaker 9:  so pressured to pay for this because they're gonna realize that, oh, I am

219
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,120
Speaker 9:  in the cheap seats all of a sudden. Not just in terms of like what I'm paying,

220
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,880
Speaker 9:  but in terms of my reach and in terms of like my, my quality of like

221
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,760
Speaker 9:  what I can see. And so I think that's why a lot of people, because it's also

222
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,160
Speaker 9:  a network effect thing will buy into this. And I actually, I actually think

223
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,240
Speaker 9:  this will be like something that millions of people do.

224
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,320
Speaker 7:  I think it's the exact opposite. I think the blue check mark is

225
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,200
Speaker 7:  about to be the mark that you're a weirdo who

226
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,880
Speaker 7:  uses Twitter so much, you're willing to pay $8 a month for it. And I

227
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,960
Speaker 7:  think it's gonna be a point like where people say, Oh, you have a blue check.

228
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,760
Speaker 7:  Ew, you really pay for this. And maybe that

229
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,040
Speaker 7:  won't happen. But I genuinely think that this is gonna be like a big moment

230
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,480
Speaker 7:  for this company and for social media and all right, like social media that

231
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,040
Speaker 7:  generally the thing is we are going to mind the crap out of your data

232
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,160
Speaker 7:  and in return you get all of this free access to communicate with other people.

233
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,000
Speaker 7:  And now he's saying, we are going to mine the crap out of your data. And

234
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,720
Speaker 7:  if you want a better experience, you have to pay $8 a month. And if you don't

235
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,640
Speaker 7:  want like that, you can use the shitty version or you can walk. And I'm like,

236
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,560
Speaker 7:  are people really going to pay that $8 many for people

237
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,080
Speaker 7:  who already say they hate the site and they use it anyway? Are those people

238
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,400
Speaker 7:  really gonna be like, Yeah, buy this pack of cigarettes, or are they gonna

239
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,160
Speaker 7:  be like, Actually

240
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,800
Speaker 5:  I'm very happy that I'm,

241
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,520
Speaker 7:  I can go get the filter list, enroll myself. Oh my god, I

242
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,880
Speaker 7:  that's maed on, I assume

243
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,400
Speaker 5:  That's Texas coming through is

244
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,960
Speaker 7:  I saw someone this week who was like, Yeah, I rolled my own cigarettes and

245
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,160
Speaker 7:  I'm like in 2022.

246
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Well did you meet someone else who smoked cloves?

247
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,320
Speaker 5:  Like let's get into it.

248
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,400
Speaker 7:  Tumblr is cloves in this situation, by the way.

249
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,200
Speaker 5:  Okay. So I, my prediction is that the reality of this is gonna be far more

250
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,000
Speaker 5:  boring and it's gonna mean nothing. And the, the

251
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,720
Speaker 5:  best comp is TSA pre-check, which is neither a status

252
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,640
Speaker 5:  symbol nor a thing that people love. It's just what you do if you

253
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,840
Speaker 5:  just want to be degraded slightly more by the government of the United States,

254
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,000
Speaker 5:  Right? Like you can have a better experience if you pay for it. This much

255
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,720
Speaker 7:  Shoes on.

256
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,120
Speaker 5:  It's not clear. You don't, the seat doesn't lay back all the way.

257
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,200
Speaker 5:  You just get to keep your shoes on and that that, like,

258
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,840
Speaker 5:  I already pay for Twitter. I I'm already paying for it paying it's $4 a month.

259
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,320
Speaker 5:  They're doubling the price to add a check mark and take away the ad free

260
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,520
Speaker 5:  experience on some publisher websites.

261
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,960
Speaker 6:  No, but but the thing is, nobody who follows you on Twitter knows that you

262
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,440
Speaker 6:  pay for Twitter. Sure. Which I think is, is really important. Right? Where

263
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,360
Speaker 6:  like, think about all the people you see in your timeline.

264
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And when you're in the pre-check line, everyone knows that you pay

265
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,400
Speaker 5:  for pre-check. It doesn't mean anyone thinks you're cool. They're just like,

266
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,160
Speaker 5:  Wow, you pay for

267
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,920
Speaker 6:  Pre, you're not thirsting for retweets in the pre-check line. Like I don't

268
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,640
Speaker 6:  think that analogy works at all if I'm being honest. It's like

269
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,840
Speaker 6:  they're, if you're like, if there's like a thirst trap camera when you get

270
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,440
Speaker 6:  in the TSA pre-check line, like then I'd be into it absolutely.

271
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,760
Speaker 5:  Gonna start doing thirst traps in the pre-check

272
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,920
Speaker 7:  Line. I think it's more like when you play a video game

273
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,840
Speaker 7:  and, and you get like a cool little like World Warcraft, you get a cool little

274
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,560
Speaker 7:  pet, right? And if you go and you do all these really cool events, you get

275
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,000
Speaker 7:  a cool pet. And so people would be like, this is my pet. And that was like

276
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,480
Speaker 7:  the blue check mark. And then other people would be like, I spent $5

277
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,840
Speaker 7:  at Subway and I also have a cool pet. And you'd see

278
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,760
Speaker 7:  those pets and you'd be like, Well you're lame because you spent $5 at Subway

279
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,320
Speaker 7:  for that pet. I

280
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,640
Speaker 5:  Mean I feel like if Elon was gonna be wild, he would introduce tiered pricing.

281
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah. There gold

282
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,000
Speaker 7:  Checkbooks. Oh my God, that's what I want

283
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,480
Speaker 5:  Checkmarks.

284
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,720
Speaker 7:  And like just go all

285
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,920
Speaker 9:  The way that could happen. That could happen. I mean I think we're

286
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,800
Speaker 9:  undervaluing the algorithmic boosting aspect of this. And we're also

287
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,000
Speaker 9:  vowing a unique aspect of Twitter's a social network, which is that a very,

288
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,720
Speaker 9:  very small percent of the user base produces the vast majority

289
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,680
Speaker 9:  of the content. And if you fall into that bucket, which is all of us, everyone

290
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,600
Speaker 9:  in media, celebrities, the Scott Galloways of the world, et cetera, you

291
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,920
Speaker 9:  are absolutely going to pay for this because otherwise your reach is gonna

292
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,560
Speaker 9:  be on day one reduced. So it's not even that you're in a separate

293
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,680
Speaker 9:  line, it's that you're in another line where you keep getting pushed to the

294
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,600
Speaker 9:  back of the line, the regular line, two steps forward.

295
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,200
Speaker 5:  I dunno if you've ever been to the airport before of

296
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,280
Speaker 6:  Well

297
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,280
Speaker 9:  At least you move forward in that line. I have precheck. I'm just

298
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,160
Speaker 9:  saying like I have precheck and I I see your analogy, but it's almost like

299
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,760
Speaker 9:  if you're in the other line, you just keep getting pushed back. It's not

300
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,800
Speaker 9:  even that you're in another line. So I, I do think the people who produce

301
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,960
Speaker 9:  the most content on Twitter will pay for this.

302
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,640
Speaker 6:  The but the, the part of this that makes me agree with Kranz is I I would

303
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,040
Speaker 6:  be more inclined to pay if it were divorced from the blue check.

304
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Because now what the blue check becomes, there's a certain world in

305
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,400
Speaker 6:  which the blue check becomes like a symbol of your thirstiness that says

306
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,120
Speaker 6:  not only do I care about Twitter, I care so much about you reading

307
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,960
Speaker 6:  my sick ass tweets that I'm gonna pay money to get in front of you.

308
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,680
Speaker 7:  Like that's exactly what it becomes.

309
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,000
Speaker 6:  All the people who made fun of Ben Smith for his like ridiculous promoted

310
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,120
Speaker 6:  tweets promoting SE four, like this is now that at scale

311
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,880
Speaker 6:  it's, it's you promoting your own tweets and that's, that's what it's gonna

312
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,280
Speaker 6:  look like.

313
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,000
Speaker 9:  Yeah, sure. But like this is what verification at Twitter was originally

314
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,080
Speaker 9:  designed to be like what Musk is doing is actually how Twitter has always

315
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,840
Speaker 9:  wanted verification to work. Which is that it's actually just to say you

316
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,560
Speaker 9:  are who you say you are and now it's linked to a credit card. So

317
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,320
Speaker 9:  obviously people can fake that it's, and that will happen. It's not But I'm

318
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,960
Speaker 9:  just saying like this is what that I mean Yes. That is what it is. It's,

319
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,280
Speaker 9:  we

320
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,080
Speaker 7:  Have an identity layer. No, it's not because it is now requiring, like I,

321
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,920
Speaker 7:  I know I saw one guy who's like a journalist in Africa and he was saying,

322
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,880
Speaker 7:  I need this because I am regularly arrested for my tweets. I'm regularly

323
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,720
Speaker 7:  like stalked for this stuff. I can't afford the $8 a month

324
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,360
Speaker 7:  or whatever it's gonna be in my country. So now I'm screwed.

325
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,160
Speaker 7:  And like those people are still going to be affected by this

326
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,440
Speaker 7:  and Oh yeah. Are they gonna, I don't think they're going to, but I think

327
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,360
Speaker 7:  like, I think like this is not just pay to be verified,

328
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,800
Speaker 7:  this is pay to be verified, get all of this stuff and pay for everybody in

329
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,360
Speaker 7:  the world to know that you pay for this. And I think that's really

330
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,200
Speaker 7:  silly. Like I want that check to go away as

331
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
Speaker 7:  soon as possible. I don't want a single person to think that I pay for twitter.com.

332
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,680
Speaker 9:  No one has invented a way to actually identify users on social media

333
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,960
Speaker 9:  at scale in a way that works yet. And I think credit card linking to accounts

334
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,760
Speaker 9:  is the best thing that we, that anyone could do in the given like right

335
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,600
Speaker 9:  now. Yeah. I'm sure something will be invented that's better than that. And

336
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,640
Speaker 9:  I hear you on the paid thing. I'm, I've heard that blue is so rushed that

337
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,880
Speaker 9:  it's only gonna be in English and only in like a few markets when it comes

338
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,840
Speaker 9:  out, which is a huge fail, right? Yeah. That's a huge fail for the

339
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,720
Speaker 9:  kind of people that you just talked about. And hopefully over time must lets

340
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,560
Speaker 9:  journalists and people who work at nonprofits and activists be able to have

341
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,440
Speaker 9:  it for free. I think that would be a good thing. I'm sure they're considering

342
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,280
Speaker 9:  it. I'm just saying as an identity layer that is actually what

343
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,840
Speaker 9:  verification was supposed to be. Twitter has just been so inept at actually

344
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,000
Speaker 9:  enforcing this over the last decade that it's become this like

345
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,960
Speaker 9:  elite class. Like you have to have a social media manager contact at

346
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,880
Speaker 9:  Twitter to be able to get it thing That was never what it was intended

347
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,040
Speaker 9:  to be. So it's actually returning verification to what it originally was

348
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,400
Speaker 9:  supposed to be, which is just, I am who I say I am,

349
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,320
Speaker 7:  But like in the worst way possible. Sure. Under the musk, which

350
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,680
Speaker 7:  is Yeah. Like it's a terrible way to do it. Well

351
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,520
Speaker 5:  So I just wanna be very clear about one thing, criticism of

352
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,320
Speaker 5:  the Musk administration of Twitter is in no way the

353
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,000
Speaker 5:  same as praise for any other previous management of Twitter.

354
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Yeah. I'm so glad you said that.

355
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,520
Speaker 5:  Deeply mismanaged company for a decade or more,

356
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,920
Speaker 7:  Right? Terribly managed.

357
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,520
Speaker 9:  Yeah. You can hold two things as truth. You cannot like the way Musk is doing

358
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,440
Speaker 9:  things. And you can also acknowledge that Twitter has been a spectacularly

359
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,240
Speaker 9:  mismanaged company and everyone at the company will privately acknowledge

360
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,440
Speaker 9:  that.

361
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,120
Speaker 7:  Yep. Like it's wild that it's taken this long to figure out the

362
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,200
Speaker 7:  verification thing for years. Everybody's like, how do we do it? And it's

363
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,600
Speaker 7:  like, I mean

364
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,440
Speaker 9:  They put the program on pause for years where they were just like, Screw

365
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,560
Speaker 9:  it, we're not gonna verify anyone else cuz this is such a mess and we don't

366
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Speaker 9:  even know how to like implement this at scale. And then they would still

367
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,800
Speaker 9:  sneak people in. Like if a Twitter employee had a contact and everyone would

368
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,400
Speaker 9:  get mad. I mean it's a, it's a disaster.

369
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,960
Speaker 5:  So here's a question. I don't pay enough attention, but I think I know the

370
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,880
Speaker 5:  answer. No one's mad at the blue checks on Instagram. Right? Right.

371
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,640
Speaker 5:  No one's mad at the, they're at Twitter. Like YouTube has effectively

372
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,160
Speaker 5:  blue checks. No one's mad at them. Right. No one's mad at the blue checks

373
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,640
Speaker 5:  on TikTok. Right. It's just Twitter.

374
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,920
Speaker 9:  Right. Cause we're all deeply insecure cynics on Twitter.

375
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,200
Speaker 7:  I think it's more because Twitter had like, I think we wanna be

376
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,800
Speaker 7:  cautious and remember that a lot of this blue checks like anger

377
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,000
Speaker 7:  came from right wing people who were upset that Trump was being de platformed

378
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,960
Speaker 7:  and felt that he was, he and other right wing commentators were being

379
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,600
Speaker 7:  de platformed at the like to prop up the blue

380
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,840
Speaker 7:  checks and that these other people should be up there. But the reason they

381
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,000
Speaker 7:  were deed was because they were sharing misinformation and saying like

382
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,000
Speaker 7:  they were instructions. Yeah. Like that's the big, like

383
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,800
Speaker 7:  that's the big part of this that's like an undercurrent of this entire thing

384
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,760
Speaker 7:  that I think a lot of people are really mindful of and they, they

385
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,720
Speaker 7:  know that like the blue check discourse always came from this

386
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,200
Speaker 7:  really

387
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,800
Speaker 5:  The mainstream media. Yeah. In a

388
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,160
Speaker 9:  Way. Cause that's what it literally has been. So if you actually see, excuse

389
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,040
Speaker 5:  Me, we are the Renegade Media sermon. Well we're, this podcast exists on

390
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,080
Speaker 5:  a fringe, not fringes of American democracy. That's

391
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,760
Speaker 9:  Right. You

392
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,520
Speaker 5:  Can't silence us and if you try, we'll come for you

393
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,800
Speaker 5:  somehow if but with weed. Yeah.

394
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,840
Speaker 7:  Laser bg.

395
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,480
Speaker 9:  I'm just saying like, Alex, if you, I I agree with you that that's how

396
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,160
Speaker 9:  obviously how check marks have been viewed. If, if it becomes something that

397
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,680
Speaker 9:  isn't regulated to a certain class by proxy of who you know, but something

398
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,720
Speaker 9:  literally anyone can just pay for, is that not actually a good thing for

399
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,440
Speaker 9:  what the check mark represents long-term?

400
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,600
Speaker 7:  I think that's good. I think like making it accessible and

401
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,440
Speaker 7:  more understandable and comprehensible is great. I think tying that to money

402
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,800
Speaker 7:  and is, is dumb. I think you can have

403
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,960
Speaker 7:  Twitter, blue, great service, you wanna pay for that. Great verification

404
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,640
Speaker 7:  should be independent of that because verification should never be

405
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,080
Speaker 7:  about whether or not you're paying for the service.

406
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,160
Speaker 5:  So what you're, you, I think there's a little bit of a heat, a heated agreement

407
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,760
Speaker 5:  going on. Yeah.

408
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,520
Speaker 7:  Right. We're furiously agreeing with each other about

409
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,080
Speaker 5:  Two, like two different things. Alex said there's two Alexs

410
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,560
Speaker 7:  You gotta go crayons and Heath.

411
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,520
Speaker 5:  God dammit. Okay. Heath said verification is a, is a

412
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,480
Speaker 5:  quality signal for Twitter. Yeah. That's the important part. I think this

413
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,440
Speaker 5:  is the thing that maybe Elon and David Sachs and David, Jason Calcan, all

414
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,200
Speaker 5:  these people are working on like get, they're lost in the poison of the the

415
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,120
Speaker 5:  blue check mind, right? Yeah. Which is, it's good for the Twitter

416
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,040
Speaker 5:  community to know that LeBron James is LeBron James

417
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,440
Speaker 5:  on Twitter. Right? Right. Like that's his account. It's really him. They've

418
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,320
Speaker 5:  done something to verify that it's him and that blue check means it's him

419
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,040
Speaker 5:  and not a fraud. Right. And across the Twitter ecosystem that is good.

420
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,080
Speaker 5:  Yes. You know that wonderful presidents the president, you know the White

421
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,800
Speaker 5:  House is the White House, You know that Chuck Todd is Chuck Todd. I was just

422
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,720
Speaker 5:  on Chuck Todd podcast. So that's, he's on my mind. Hey Chuck, that

423
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Speaker 5:  you shouldn't charge the people for that. That's a value you are providing

424
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,360
Speaker 5:  to the end user of Twitter. Right. To say these people are who they say they

425
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,080
Speaker 5:  are. You can trust this information. Yes. Adding capitalism

426
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,000
Speaker 5:  to that does not necessarily accomplish that goal. Correct.

427
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,400
Speaker 5:  In a way that you need that goal to be accomplished. And he's already said

428
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,880
Speaker 5:  we're gonna start giving politicians and other quote public figures an additional

429
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,960
Speaker 5:  label that they already have to serve that purpose.

430
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,560
Speaker 7:  A blue check maybe it'll

431
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,680
Speaker 5:  Be pink. That's a check plus. Yeah. Right. And I think they just, that's

432
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,080
Speaker 5:  a gold check. They just like hate the media and they're like, the media should

433
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,840
Speaker 5:  pay us. The flip side of that is, as he pointed out,

434
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:53,240
Speaker 5:  we make all the content on Twitter, like the people not, we

435
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,320
Speaker 5:  immediately, like the people, the users of Twitter make all the stuff. And

436
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,280
Speaker 5:  I cannot think of another social platform that charges

437
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,200
Speaker 5:  its users to have good experiences in that way. Like

438
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,560
Speaker 5:  yeah, YouTube is not out there being like, Hey Mark, he brownley,

439
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,600
Speaker 5:  would you like to pay us a little bit more money to have a not garbage experience

440
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,440
Speaker 5:  on YouTube? They're much more like, Hey, we found additional ways

441
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,160
Speaker 5:  for you to make money tick. Like YouTube shorts now

442
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,720
Speaker 5:  has an ad split that is more lucrative for you than TikTok

443
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,960
Speaker 5:  cuz we need to keep you here and not have you go to TikTok, which

444
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,800
Speaker 5:  only as a creator fund. Right. And TikTok immediately responded to that by

445
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,400
Speaker 5:  saying, we're gonna roll out better monetization than this creator fund because

446
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,280
Speaker 5:  that is the competition that you need for users. You need to pay them more

447
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,600
Speaker 5:  money. Yeah. You need to pay your creators more money. Elon has said that

448
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,160
Speaker 5:  this $8 a month fee will somehow create a fund to pay creators.

449
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,240
Speaker 5:  The math on it is bad. It's,

450
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,120
Speaker 5:  it's horrible. At $8 a month you get all 400,000 people, which you won't

451
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,640
Speaker 5:  get. But assuming you get all 400 those people, it's like what? 35, 30

452
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,040
Speaker 5:  2 million a year? It's nothing.

453
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,320
Speaker 9:  I think it's gonna be dramatically more than the current 400,000 that opt

454
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,320
Speaker 9:  into this because of the network effects of people realizing that they're

455
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,160
Speaker 9:  getting gated in, in the algorithm because of, and

456
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,880
Speaker 9:  because of like a simple thing like default tab placement matters

457
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,240
Speaker 9:  a lot in these experiences and the verified notifications

458
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,160
Speaker 9:  experience is literally gonna be first when you open notifications on Twitter.

459
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,600
Speaker 9:  Why

460
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:19,720
Speaker 5:  Do you

461
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,360
Speaker 7:  Think they're gonna do that and not just leave the platform for one that

462
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,720
Speaker 7:  doesn't charge them $8? Where

463
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,120
Speaker 9:  Are they gonna go? I mean I've always like, I mean everyone's always writing

464
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,560
Speaker 9:  and saying like when a platform goes through a moment like this, oh people

465
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,840
Speaker 9:  are gonna go. And right now it's masked on whatever these network effects

466
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,280
Speaker 9:  are really hard to rebuild. Twitter's had over a decade of this

467
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,320
Speaker 9:  and I just don't see the, the current creator class of Twitter,

468
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,800
Speaker 9:  which is that, you know,

469
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,840
Speaker 7:  I mean we saw it with Tumblr. Like Tumblr I think is our best exam. I know

470
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,920
Speaker 7:  I bring it up a lot, but it is our best example here. They said we're gonna

471
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,840
Speaker 7:  get rid of boobies. I mean they really said we're gonna get rid of nudity.

472
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,240
Speaker 7:  We don't want any nudity on the website. And that included,

473
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,760
Speaker 5:  Verizon says, no boobs.

474
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,560
Speaker 7:  And that included no female presenting nipples. That was a really

475
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,280
Speaker 7:  big one. That was in like their, their announcement on it and they lost over

476
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,800
Speaker 7:  a third of their people like, like over a third of their audience just said,

477
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,480
Speaker 7:  Okay, I'm out. And some of them went to Twitter and some of 'em went to TikTok

478
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,160
Speaker 7:  and a lot of 'em went to Discord and some of 'em went to Pillow Fort. But

479
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,640
Speaker 7:  they did say, I don't want to be a part of this. And I think

480
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,800
Speaker 7:  we're gonna see that on Twitter too. And maybe those people will go

481
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,240
Speaker 7:  to Mastodon hysterical, maybe they'll go to Tumblr,

482
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,880
Speaker 7:  not likely. But I think they are gonna go and look at other

483
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,840
Speaker 7:  avenues cuz it's like, well why should I stay here and be charged

484
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,720
Speaker 7:  for this experience that oftentimes I hate when I can go to TikTok

485
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,200
Speaker 7:  for free when I can go to Mastodon and have

486
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,640
Speaker 7:  1212 people talk to me. Yeah. But for

487
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,320
Speaker 5:  Free. And then TikTok will happily serve me good tweets of people just

488
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,080
Speaker 5:  on a green screen in front of a good tweet

489
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,000
Speaker 7:  Pointing out and saying, Look, this is good.

490
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:58,280
Speaker 9:  I hear you Kranz, I don't think there's anything that replaces Twitter for

491
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,240
Speaker 9:  the people who are addicted to it. There's nothing that has the same network

492
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,040
Speaker 9:  effects, the same potential reach that you can have a tweet that can get

493
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,840
Speaker 9:  15 million impressions in three days or

494
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,760
Speaker 9:  2 million because you know, like you just, you can't get that TikTok Yeah.

495
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,520
Speaker 9:  If you like videos, if you can, if you make videos, but for text

496
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,200
Speaker 9:  and for news, there's nothing that can replace Twitter that it currently

497
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,200
Speaker 9:  exists.

498
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,400
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I'm, I'm with Heath here and I think the, the reality

499
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,120
Speaker 6:  of Twitter is that Twitter costing $8 will not be in like the 10

500
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,160
Speaker 6:  worst things about Twitter. And like

501
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

502
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,800
Speaker 6:  And we're all still here, right? Like it's, it's, there was a minute where

503
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,920
Speaker 6:  it was like, you're gonna be able to pay to make it better and now it's,

504
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,760
Speaker 6:  you're gonna be able to pay and not make it worse. And I think that is a

505
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,360
Speaker 6:  really odd way of thinking about the platform, but like,

506
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,160
Speaker 7:  Is that precheck

507
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,680
Speaker 6:  Line think it's gonna

508
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,720
Speaker 5:  Work the precheck line? Look, let's say

509
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,920
Speaker 7:  I love to keep my shoes on.

510
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,360
Speaker 5:  I'm just, again, just the math here is, so the math is so revealing.

511
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,440
Speaker 5:  Let's say they get 10 x the users they have for the

512
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,880
Speaker 5:  current verified products. So 400,000, they gets

513
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,840
Speaker 5:  4 million people decide to pay $8 a month for Twitter.

514
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,720
Speaker 5:  They will make 384 million a year. Twitter makes a billion

515
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,640
Speaker 5:  dollars a quarter. Like

516
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,800
Speaker 9:  Eli, he doesn't care about the economic

517
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,680
Speaker 7:  He has to, Right? Like he has to pay down a billion dollars

518
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,280
Speaker 7:  a year.

519
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,160
Speaker 9:  Yeah. But, but I don't think Blue is about making money. I think it's the

520
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,920
Speaker 9:  identity problem. It's how do we somehow verify the identity

521
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,920
Speaker 9:  of people. And the only way, again I come back to that's people have

522
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,720
Speaker 9:  decided is to do a credit card. And I think there's a plenty of like

523
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,480
Speaker 9:  fair criticism of what happens to people who are trying to anonymously

524
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,360
Speaker 9:  speak out, get information out. A lot of the ways that Twitter really took

525
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,520
Speaker 9:  off, say in the Arab Spring, how does that happen in an environment like

526
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,680
Speaker 9:  this where you need to have, it doesn't, a proven real identity tied to a

527
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,480
Speaker 9:  credit card. It doesn't or it's regulated to that bottom half of the service,

528
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,800
Speaker 9:  Right? That's not getting the same level of reach and it's up to the check

529
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,920
Speaker 9:  marks to go down, find it, bring it up into the checkmarked environment,

530
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,800
Speaker 9:  which is just like futurist and horrible. But I, I, I think

531
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:03,720
Speaker 9:  I do think there's going to be, you know, at least that identity

532
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,360
Speaker 9:  layer that is not about making money, but is just about

533
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,000
Speaker 9:  making Twitter a place where you know who you're seeing

534
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,240
Speaker 7:  If you pay for it.

535
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,320
Speaker 9:  And I don't think he really cares about it being if you pay for it. And I

536
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,200
Speaker 9:  don't think he cares about it being, I think he thinks advertising is gonna

537
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,880
Speaker 9:  remain the biggest part of the company's revenue even though advertisers

538
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,160
Speaker 9:  certainly.

539
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,960
Speaker 7:  Well let's, let's talk about that. Advertise. Yes. Oh my God,

540
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,440
Speaker 5:  Are we ready for this? Let's talk about the thesis of Welcome to Hell Eli.

541
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,720
Speaker 7:  How's that going for him?

542
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,680
Speaker 5:  So there's a, a good piece in Rolling Stone, that one up. Just be

543
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,080
Speaker 5:  before we started taping like the right wingers are already starting to turn

544
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,000
Speaker 5:  on Elon because he had a meeting with CMOs. He like

545
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,120
Speaker 5:  had an open letter to advertisers, said it's not gonna become a hellscape.

546
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,360
Speaker 5:  He had a meeting with a bunch of civil society groups, promised them that

547
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,560
Speaker 5:  he wouldn't change the rules before they

548
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,200
Speaker 7:  Listening

549
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,120
Speaker 5:  Tour a listening tour. And you know, the, his new right wing

550
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,040
Speaker 5:  fans who are quote unquote, you know, for free speech people, which

551
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,560
Speaker 5:  is really just like the N-word club is here. You know, like

552
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,160
Speaker 5:  they're pissed at him already, you know, and and there's just a variety of

553
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,880
Speaker 5:  figures who are saying we were promised free speech and now you're talking

554
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:12,440
Speaker 5:  to you know, the Anti-Defamation league and why would you do that? That has

555
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,800
Speaker 5:  nothing to do with free speech. And I think he's caught in this place where

556
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:19,760
Speaker 5:  Alex, I think you've talked to some advertisers, I have talked to some advertising

557
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,720
Speaker 5:  folks. There's just a lot of skepticism that this

558
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,200
Speaker 5:  will remain a good platform for advertising. And what I mean by that

559
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,080
Speaker 5:  specifically is they don't want to be near bad content.

560
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,240
Speaker 5:  They never have, they care a lot about brand safety.

561
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:39,760
Speaker 5:  This is why YouTube has apocalypses over the years. Yeah, right. YouTube

562
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,720
Speaker 5:  gets a little outta control, the moderation gets a little haywire, the community

563
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,040
Speaker 5:  goes a little haywire and the advertisers all walk away and this is a cycle

564
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,000
Speaker 5:  that plays out on YouTube kind of over and over again.

565
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,600
Speaker 5:  This is a cycle that's playing out on Twitter kind of for the first time

566
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,280
Speaker 5:  in this way where the advertisers say like the ipg, which is one of the biggest

567
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,680
Speaker 5:  holding companies of ad agencies is saying we recommend that you paused.

568
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,440
Speaker 5:  GM has paused at spend, I think partially a tweak Tesla

569
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,720
Speaker 5:  like maybe more than partially Tesla.

570
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,760
Speaker 7:  Like all those car companies,

571
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:10,600
Speaker 9:  There's a legitimate concern that he literally has dozens of Tesla employees

572
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,240
Speaker 9:  inside Twitter right now. And why would you, why would I put my brand campaigns

573
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,760
Speaker 9:  and my spending and all that stuff on a platform that you have access to

574
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,440
Speaker 9:  when you run Tesla? I don't think there's gonna be any auto dealers on Twitter

575
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:20,960
Speaker 9:  for a while.

576
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,120
Speaker 5:  I mean that part's really funny. Tesla has historically never done any marketing.

577
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,160
Speaker 5:  He has no idea how advertising works, right?

578
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,120
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Twitter. Twitter is Tesla's marketing like you Like that's the thing.

579
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,000
Speaker 9:  Like he bought his marketing org right? It's just funny, like

580
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,680
Speaker 5:  That's what it is. He now has a customer, like the marketers

581
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,920
Speaker 5:  are Twitter's customers. That's where your billion dollars a quarter comes

582
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,720
Speaker 5:  from. Yeah. Is ad agencies and CMOs and he

583
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,440
Speaker 5:  is, I think enlisted Jason Cal Canis who started

584
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,240
Speaker 5:  Weblog Zinc and Gadget, like loved Jason, very sincere guy,

585
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,440
Speaker 5:  but he's the face of the advertising organization Now for these marketers

586
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,480
Speaker 5:  that's a lot like he's a new person, they don't trust him and they

587
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,520
Speaker 7:  Don't, doesn't have a title.

588
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,960
Speaker 5:  I don't know if you've seen the text to Elon. They think that he's gonna

589
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,840
Speaker 5:  do what Elon tells him to do. Maybe there's evidence for that

590
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,680
Speaker 5:  and maybe there's not fall in a Jason's one who sent the

591
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,320
Speaker 5:  get your blades out boys text to Elon in regards to sharpen your blades.

592
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,120
Speaker 5:  Right. That's the, that it's just this cast of

593
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,160
Speaker 5:  characters and if you think that marketing is stupid and Tesla doesn't need

594
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,760
Speaker 5:  to do it and you go to the CMO of a GM or the

595
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,680
Speaker 5:  CMO of a Ford and you're like, Give me some money. Yeah. So you can compete

596
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,400
Speaker 5:  on my platform against my own tweets. They're like,

597
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we don't trust you. And if you go to Proctor and Gamble

598
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,120
Speaker 5:  and they wanna sell Tide or whatever you wanna sell

599
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,880
Speaker 5:  and you're like, and also we've decided to let 10% more

600
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,520
Speaker 5:  racism back on the platform. They're just like, no. Right.

601
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,600
Speaker 5:  And so he's got this poll out that's like should advertisers support free

602
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,800
Speaker 5:  speech or political correctness? And it's like, dude, it's their money.

603
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,360
Speaker 5:  They can pay for whatever they want. That's the free

604
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:02,760
Speaker 5:  speech.

605
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,320
Speaker 5:  It's just utter like that piece of it, to me it's like such a blind

606
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,120
Speaker 5:  spot for him that he's got customers now.

607
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,280
Speaker 6:  And unlike Twitter's users, those customers have a million places

608
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,080
Speaker 6:  to go. Yeah. Like if, if you want to advertise on social

609
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,320
Speaker 6:  platforms, your options are are limitless. And there are a bunch of

610
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,640
Speaker 6:  companies out there who will very happily take the money that you're taking

611
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,400
Speaker 6:  away from Twitter right now. So I think like all the network, but

612
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,320
Speaker 5:  Facebook would love some incremental ad dollars. They would be very happy

613
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,920
Speaker 5:  to make a little bit more money than they've been making.

614
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,280
Speaker 6:  Snapchat's still a thing. They, they have ads.

615
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,040
Speaker 5:  Definitely what I've heard is that people, you know, the

616
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,160
Speaker 5:  advertiser class thinks Twitter is fun. It's like, it's like the

617
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,080
Speaker 5:  most live environment. Yeah. So if you do the thing, you make the launch,

618
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,240
Speaker 5:  it's where everyone goes to see if any they got any traction but they're

619
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:52,920
Speaker 5:  like, we don't need it.

620
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,800
Speaker 7:  It's like the smallest part of a lot of these big agencies spend. Yeah.

621
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,920
Speaker 7:  When it comes to social media, this is like at the very bottom of their thing

622
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,080
Speaker 7:  and they're like, oh yeah, okay we'll throw a hundred K to a quick campaign,

623
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,400
Speaker 7:  do some promoted tweets. So I'm really, really curious to

624
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,040
Speaker 7:  see how much this like I'm gonna be focused on, on blue and solving

625
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,920
Speaker 7:  this identity problem is going to at the cost

626
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,320
Speaker 7:  of like, I'm going to make all of these advertisers feel comfortable so I

627
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,480
Speaker 7:  can get their billions of dollars so I can make my billion dollar. Yeah.

628
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,200
Speaker 5:  Marketing. Yeah. I just think the idea that Elon has already

629
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,800
Speaker 5:  pissed off some of his most vocal hard

630
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,600
Speaker 5:  right. Ultra-conservative influencer supporters because he has to promise

631
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,480
Speaker 5:  the advertisers and like civil groups Yeah. That he can't change

632
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,360
Speaker 5:  the rules too much is fast. Like he's gotta pull

633
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,760
Speaker 5:  that bandaid right after the midterms and be like, here are the new rules.

634
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,680
Speaker 7:  And I'm really curious also how much, how much of Twitter's

635
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,720
Speaker 7:  ad money was coming from car companies. Because like car companies are

636
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Speaker 7:  a big advertising market, right? Like they spend a lot of money.

637
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,120
Speaker 9:  Yeah. My understanding is the, the top spenders are

638
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,920
Speaker 9:  the streamers or the hbos, the Disneys, the companies that are doing

639
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,520
Speaker 9:  big brand campaigns around stuff

640
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:03,880
Speaker 5:  Like that.

641
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,760
Speaker 7:  And we saw this week that they're also thinking like they're very conscious

642
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,520
Speaker 7:  of like not Iger, Bob Chape, the new CEO of

643
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,960
Speaker 7:  Disney has been making rounds with all of the, the conservative like

644
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,800
Speaker 7:  senators and congressmen assuming that the midterms is gonna go their

645
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,760
Speaker 7:  way so that he doesn't get hurt and whatever comes next. So that

646
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,080
Speaker 7:  Disney doesn't once again become at the focal point of like what's happening

647
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,320
Speaker 7:  in the world. You guys suck. So it's gonna be really, really interesting

648
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,920
Speaker 7:  to see what happens with that. Plus with Twitter like this, the whole brand

649
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,800
Speaker 7:  safety thing is you're now having two very different concepts of what brand

650
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,240
Speaker 7:  safety does.

651
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,520
Speaker 5:  I do look forward to a conception of freedom of speech in America where the

652
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,120
Speaker 5:  government forces Disney to buy ads on Twitter next to racist content. Yeah.

653
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,960
Speaker 5:  Like you can just, there's a bill coming, like Ted Cruz is like, I gotta

654
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,080
Speaker 5:  work this out. That's what's I'm going in the lab. Yeah. Here's my new freedom

655
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,840
Speaker 5:  of speech Bill Disney is required to buy ads on Twitter

656
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,760
Speaker 7:  And it's gonna be like what? What Supreme Court's gonna do it and then

657
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,120
Speaker 7:  we're gonna just have the same conversation in four years.

658
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,320
Speaker 5:  By the way, everyone should read Addie's piece about free speech in two 30.

659
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,160
Speaker 5:  That's our like big midterm story.

660
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,080
Speaker 7:  Yeah, he's great.

661
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:10,160
Speaker 9:  I I would be curious to hear you guys react to this. So something Elon talked

662
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,040
Speaker 9:  about internally on his, his first week at Twitter is starlink in the

663
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,160
Speaker 9:  potential of using starlink to deliver Twitter to countries where

664
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,920
Speaker 9:  I believe the readout of the meeting was something like they discussed how

665
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,560
Speaker 9:  they would literally need to shoot down satellites and that's the only way

666
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:23,840
Speaker 9:  that

667
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,160
Speaker 7:  Did he not talk to Zuck who had this exact same plan like

668
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,800
Speaker 7:  six years

669
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,280
Speaker 5:  Ago Zuck had a plane, Google had balloons.

670
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,240
Speaker 9:  Yeah. And I, I just, I'm curious about that and what you guys think about

671
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,840
Speaker 9:  that because obviously Musk is heavily compromised in China.

672
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,480
Speaker 9:  You know, Twitter employees are already wondering, is he gonna build a localized

673
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,600
Speaker 9:  Chinese Twitter that has, you know, he says he is

674
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,200
Speaker 9:  going have free speech but also abide by local laws. What does that look

675
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,680
Speaker 9:  like in a place like China? It looks like Doyon the sister app to

676
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,640
Speaker 9:  it looks very different, but also like starlink, what if he just like

677
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,800
Speaker 9:  starts trying to like beam Twitter to countries

678
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,920
Speaker 9:  that do not have anything near the US Constitution via starlink?

679
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:09,000
Speaker 5:  I mean he can and he can't, right? I mean right now he

680
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,680
Speaker 5:  won't let starlink do that. Like when you install a starlink receiver in

681
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,640
Speaker 5:  a country that's not supported, it's just GPS is out. Like, and that's why

682
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,440
Speaker 5:  they had to enable it in Ukraine in all these other places. So he's gotta

683
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,080
Speaker 5:  change that decision. I think that decision is hard to change because he

684
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,840
Speaker 5:  needs like SpaceX to be able to be

685
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,000
Speaker 5:  somewhat neutral cuz it flies over every country and then he's

686
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,320
Speaker 5:  gotta ship Teslas everywhere. You're right that he's compromised in China,

687
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,600
Speaker 5:  but he's compromised in China by is that he needs to sell a lot of Teslas

688
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,520
Speaker 5:  there and he makes Teslas there. So if he's beaming Twitter

689
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,600
Speaker 5:  to Chinese consumers using Starling, they're just gonna

690
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,520
Speaker 5:  shut down his Tesla factory the way they,

691
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,200
Speaker 7:  They're just gonna take those Teslas and now there'll be a lot of cool cop

692
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,600
Speaker 7:  cars in China with Tesla logo.

693
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,200
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

694
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,800
Speaker 6:  But at the same time, I absolutely believe he will try this like

695
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,080
Speaker 6:  with, with a hundred percent certainty this will be a thing that happens

696
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,000
Speaker 6:  because, because what we're, what we've been watching since this started

697
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,320
Speaker 6:  in April is Elon Musk like speed running the history of social media

698
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,720
Speaker 6:  and and one of the steps along the way is trying to bring your

699
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,680
Speaker 6:  app to other people who can't otherwise get it through weird means of

700
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,600
Speaker 6:  the internet. Like it's just a thing you're required to do. Google tried

701
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,320
Speaker 6:  it, Facebook tried it didn't work, but it's, it's like, it's one of the steps

702
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,840
Speaker 6:  you have to fail on before you get to like building a payments network. And

703
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,560
Speaker 6:  he'll eventually land on like vertical video and turning Twitter into a music

704
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,520
Speaker 6:  app like everybody else does. But like this is the path

705
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,160
Speaker 9:  It's gonna be delivering groceries and

706
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,320
Speaker 6:  That's exactly right.

707
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,120
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's amazing because like Mark

708
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,480
Speaker 9:  Zuckerberg, it took him almost three years to meet with like the

709
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,800
Speaker 9:  ADL and like all of these like activist groups and human rights groups

710
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,280
Speaker 9:  and like Musk did it like two days ago, right? He's like a week into the

711
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,040
Speaker 9:  company and he's already like doing the Zuck like I'm gonna clean this up

712
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,840
Speaker 9:  tour Zuck. By the way, I wish he would've actually answered my question when

713
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,360
Speaker 9:  I asked him for advice for Musk, cuz he would've probably said like,

714
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,200
Speaker 9:  Don't do this,

715
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,840
Speaker 9:  trust me, welcome to hell. Right. But yeah, I

716
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:13,440
Speaker 9:  I I I think the next shoot a drop is who he actually

717
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,600
Speaker 9:  installs permanently in some of these key roles

718
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,680
Speaker 9:  because all these people we've been talking about, David Sachs, Jason call

719
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,720
Speaker 9:  Canis, they're, they're temporary, they're not gonna be working there fulltime.

720
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:28,000
Speaker 9:  So who are the people that he either elevates internally, brings in from

721
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,040
Speaker 9:  other companies, et cetera. I think that's the next,

722
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:33,440
Speaker 6:  Is there any sense of who the like leading candidate for that would be so

723
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,480
Speaker 6:  far? Like who's the, who's the betting favorite? Well,

724
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,240
Speaker 9:  Cavan, the former head of product to Paraag fired in

725
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,800
Speaker 9:  May has been in the building for the last week. So

726
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,520
Speaker 9:  there's rumors he may come back. The optics are really,

727
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,920
Speaker 5:  He tweeted that he's not actively involved. He applied to someone and said,

728
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
Speaker 5:  but who knows? Well

729
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,600
Speaker 9:  The optics are rough because if you used to work at Twitter under the former

730
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,160
Speaker 9:  regime and you come in now as Elon has kind of brutally

731
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,040
Speaker 9:  fired the current regime, how does that work with people who have,

732
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,640
Speaker 9:  feel certain ways about that? Right? Like it's just, it's a tough thing to

733
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,360
Speaker 9:  be like a former person and come in That said, there are like 16 former heads

734
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,160
Speaker 9:  of product, so I'm sure one of them is up for the job.

735
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,400
Speaker 9:  The problem is, is you've gotta find someone who, like a, wants to work at

736
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,320
Speaker 9:  a private company that's like Musk's fourth company doesn't wanna work

737
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,280
Speaker 9:  in big tech or wants to leave and also wants to deal with cleaning up

738
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,000
Speaker 9:  and fixing Twitter. It's just, and working for Musk. Like there's a, that's

739
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,160
Speaker 9:  a short list I think

740
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,040
Speaker 7:  Right now I can't imagine he pays like really well for this

741
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,960
Speaker 7:  role either. I, I feel like he's the kind of guy who's like, you know what

742
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,880
Speaker 7:  you're working for Musk.

743
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,960
Speaker 5:  Well, so at Tesla he pays really well cuz he pays in Tesla stock and he

744
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,760
Speaker 5:  doesn't have that anymore.

745
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,120
Speaker 7:  I don't want that Twitter stock.

746
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,640
Speaker 9:  They actually switched to Cash grants recently too for a lot of people

747
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,080
Speaker 9:  because of the economy. They, he started paying out cash awards

748
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,440
Speaker 9:  cashed out. So I do think like, hey, if he's like, hey, I mean he's told

749
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,560
Speaker 9:  investors I know this, that he wants to take Twitter public again in like

750
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,480
Speaker 9:  three to five years. So if that's the pitch, come in, fix this, take it back

751
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,880
Speaker 9:  out with me. You'll have whatever, half a percent of the company when it

752
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,880
Speaker 9:  goes out, we're gonna make it a hundred billion dollar company. I'm Eon Musk,

753
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,840
Speaker 9:  let's go. There may be some people who would bite at that. I think he has

754
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,000
Speaker 9:  a lot of supporters obviously, so I just, I'm not sure who

755
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,960
Speaker 9:  it's gonna be right now. Like I said, he has almost 90 direct reports right

756
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,120
Speaker 9:  now.

757
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,660
Speaker 5:  That's amazing. I mean honestly there, there's parts that's like where you

758
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,060
Speaker 5:  just have to, you just have to give it to him.

759
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,900
Speaker 7:  Doesn't he have 20 direct reports at Tesla? Yeah.

760
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:28,220
Speaker 5:  I

761
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,580
Speaker 9:  Mean something like that. So what

762
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,420
Speaker 7:  Does his phone look like right now? I

763
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,020
Speaker 9:  Can't imagine, does

764
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,940
Speaker 7:  He just set on fire? Like does he keep it like in ice at all times

765
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,420
Speaker 7:  so he can use it like

766
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,900
Speaker 9:  It's just the Twitter icon just on the home screen

767
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,860
Speaker 5:  Mean I talk to a lot of CEOs, I'm like, what's your structure? What's your

768
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,380
Speaker 5:  ING decision? I definitely know a CEO is like, how does he get it all done?

769
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:53,180
Speaker 9:  I think he literally just like barely sleeps. I think he three sleeps like

770
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,500
Speaker 9:  three to four hours a night. Like he was tweeting at like 5:00 AM the other

771
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,180
Speaker 9:  day. And like, like how in bananas this all is, is like Twitter employees

772
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,940
Speaker 9:  are glued to like the Elon Jet Twitter account to like, that tracks where

773
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,820
Speaker 9:  his jet takes off and lands to like see is he coming to the our office next.

774
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:12,500
Speaker 9:  Like it's, it's just an insane, I mean who knows, like we're all Lima may

775
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,460
Speaker 9:  come in and be running. Wow,

776
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:13,980
Speaker 5:  That's

777
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,060
Speaker 9:  Enough. And a and a

778
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,420
Speaker 5:  See ya. It was good to see you Alex. All

Speaker 5:  about the Smart Hub. We're right back.

783
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:52,710
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back. We're back. That's enough. We're

784
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,150
Speaker 5:  just gonna put that aside. We're

785
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,190
Speaker 7:  Gonna talk about what really matters.

786
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:59,030
Speaker 5:  There you go. I'm tired. There you go. We're gonna talk about

787
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,630
Speaker 5:  gadgets and standards and parties

788
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,150
Speaker 5:  in Amsterdam. Were just, doors are locking and unlocking left and right.

789
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,150
Speaker 5:  It's matter. Launch day. This is a big deal. Yeah.

790
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,910
Speaker 6:  Wait, I'm sorry, can I just pause real fast? Alex, I just want to acknowledge

791
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:16,510
Speaker 6:  the matter pun that you just made that I think completely missed. No, I didn't

792
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:19,430
Speaker 6:  miss it and I just want you to know it. It was very good. Thank you. It was

793
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,070
Speaker 6:  very good. I liked it very much and I just want you to know that I see you

794
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,910
Speaker 7:  And I appreciate, I like, I feel like I need to have a limit on how many

795
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,670
Speaker 7:  times I can do that. Pun in this, in this next 45 minutes.

796
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:29,070
Speaker 7:  It's,

797
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:32,070
Speaker 6:  It's one and you, you did it and congratulations, you used,

798
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:35,350
Speaker 7:  You have to call me out if I do it again. I'm gonna try really, really hard

799
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:35,790
Speaker 7:  not to.

800
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,510
Speaker 5:  My strategy with puns is that you just ignore the bullies that go away

801
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,350
Speaker 5:  and puns are verbal bullies.

802
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:46,350
Speaker 5:  That's what I got for you. No matter launch day it did. What's going on?

803
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:49,670
Speaker 7:  Okay, so, So Matter launched over 190

804
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,110
Speaker 7:  Smart Home devices are now certified by Matter. But I think the big thing

805
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:57,030
Speaker 7:  was that we also heard a lot about what's coming next for

806
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,030
Speaker 7:  matter and, and we're starting to see a lot of these other products say,

807
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,830
Speaker 7:  Hey, yeah, now we're gonna be on matter. Nano Leaf was one of the big ones

808
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,750
Speaker 7:  that just announced that they're gonna finally put out a bunch of matter

809
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,950
Speaker 7:  products. They'd not done it before this. They'd had some thread light bulbs.

810
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,630
Speaker 7:  I have one, it's lovely, but it doesn't have matter. And so now it's gonna

811
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:17,590
Speaker 7:  have, if you go and buy the new ones, they will have thread and matter

812
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,590
Speaker 7:  in them. Another one was Eve's Eve

813
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:25,070
Speaker 7:  is like a big company, really works closely with Apple Home Kit

814
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:29,280
Speaker 7:  and it's finally getting matter. Yeah, that's really exciting. I, I was

815
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,280
Speaker 7:  noticing a lot of these products were ones that were like kind of exclusively

816
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,400
Speaker 7:  Home Kit before this. Yeah. And, and now they're gonna be everywhere. And

817
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,280
Speaker 7:  that's exciting because Home Kit smart gadgets I feel are

818
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:39,480
Speaker 7:  better.

819
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,080
Speaker 5:  Yes, I agree. So, I mean, the interesting underlying piece of matter is that

820
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,960
Speaker 5:  it is basically home kit. Yeah. So Apple, the, you know, there's a real

821
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,640
Speaker 5:  experience with all this where you just, it's like you just wish everyone

822
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,160
Speaker 5:  would cut to the end. Yeah. Like two years before the end.

823
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,440
Speaker 5:  And so, you know, Amazon had its own ecosystem and Google had its own

824
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,960
Speaker 5:  ecosystem and Apple had its own ecosystem and you're like, Why don't you

825
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,560
Speaker 5:  all just make a thing that works together? And they're like, No, because

826
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,080
Speaker 5:  we would like to fully dominate your life in every way possible.

827
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,600
Speaker 7:  Yeah. We wanna destroy your

828
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,480
Speaker 5:  Credit card. And then like five years later, here they are. They're very

829
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,720
Speaker 5:  proud of their new standard that they all made together because they realize

830
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,600
Speaker 5:  this was stupid. Yeah. So I don't want take them very happy. They did.

831
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,600
Speaker 5:  It matters. Great.

832
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:19,560
Speaker 7:  It took,

833
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it took a long time.

834
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,360
Speaker 7:  It took a long time. It shouldn't have taken this long. It kept getting delayed.

835
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,560
Speaker 7:  It was supposed to take about what, in like 2021 I think. Yeah. Like it,

836
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,280
Speaker 7:  it kept getting delayed. It was kind of obnoxious that it took this long.

837
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,880
Speaker 7:  Especially because a lot of this stuff could already work together. You could

838
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,800
Speaker 7:  go and get HomeBridge, you could go and get these other software products

839
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,480
Speaker 7:  and just make this shit work together and be friends.

840
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,880
Speaker 7:  And the companies were like, No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait. We're gonna

841
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,520
Speaker 7:  get thread and then we're gonna have our new standard took.

842
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,840
Speaker 5:  But the reason it's Homecare devices first is because it's Apple's credit.

843
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:54,920
Speaker 5:  A lot of what matter is is Home Kit. Yeah. Like Apple

844
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,880
Speaker 5:  basically gave away the store on the Home Kit standard

845
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,440
Speaker 5:  and said, Here you use everyone, Use Home Kit. It's secure. It's good. It's

846
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,160
Speaker 5:  what we will approve Apple to make a smart home device. You wanna be on the

847
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,080
Speaker 5:  iPhone, you wanna be in the control panel on the iPhone. So

848
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,640
Speaker 5:  everyone Apple saying we're gonna let it be home Kit. Cuz that's what we'll

849
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,160
Speaker 5:  approve. Big step for Apple.

850
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:15,840
Speaker 7:  Huge

851
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,120
Speaker 5:  Step for Apple. Imagine they like,

852
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:18,600
Speaker 7:  They don't play nice.

853
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,560
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like whoever at Apple got back to their house, they closed to the door.

854
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,920
Speaker 5:  They're like, I hope I did the right thing. You know, like that. Does that

855
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,880
Speaker 5:  kind of move for them? So I You're Eve is like a big home kit company. People

856
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,560
Speaker 5:  are like their stuff. Nale

857
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:31,480
Speaker 7:  Nale.

858
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,160
Speaker 5:  They were,

859
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:36,120
Speaker 7:  They do the cool like light panels. Yeah. That you always see in

860
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,800
Speaker 7:  every single battle station photo on Reddit. Yeah. Every guy is like, Yeah

861
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,760
Speaker 7:  I got my new, my new

862
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,320
Speaker 5:  Computer streamers have an leaf that, that's great. But like nano leaf flights

863
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,400
Speaker 5:  are great cuz they're, they, they have been on thread for a while. So if

864
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,080
Speaker 5:  you had like a home pod mini and a nano leaf flight

865
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,360
Speaker 7:  Just works.

866
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:54,760
Speaker 5:  It just works. And it's like instantaneous in a way that the best wifi

867
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Setups are not instantaneous.

868
00:49:56,870 --> 00:50:00,720
Speaker 7:  I think one of the big ones here for me was Phillips Hugh Bridge is

869
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,320
Speaker 7:  going to have a software update to support matter. That's really, really

870
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,840
Speaker 7:  nice because Phillips Hugh Bridge I think is probably one of the ones that

871
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,200
Speaker 7:  the majority of people, if you do do smart home, you dip your toe in.

872
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,040
Speaker 7:  That's like one of the first things you do. You go and you buy the cool lights,

873
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:17,920
Speaker 7:  you spend $40 per light bulb and you feel really proud about it until somebody

874
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,960
Speaker 7:  asks you how much you spent per light bulb. Yeah. And you do the math in

875
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,200
Speaker 7:  your head.

876
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,600
Speaker 6:  That one is kind of funny to me because like in theory what

877
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,480
Speaker 6:  matter does is obviate the need for things like the hub

878
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,840
Speaker 6:  bridge. Yeah. Like the whole reason for matter is so that we don't have to

879
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,920
Speaker 6:  plug in a million hub bridges to our homes. And to me that's like a perfect

880
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,160
Speaker 6:  example, right? Like in in the best possible world, Phillips have come out

881
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,280
Speaker 6:  and say all of our lights now support matter, control them however you want.

882
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,920
Speaker 6:  Happy days are here again. But instead this is like, this is the launch of

883
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,520
Speaker 6:  matter, but it's actually like one step in the right direction

884
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,440
Speaker 6:  instead of like a solved

885
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,040
Speaker 7:  Problem once. Right. Well cause they don't have a lot of those, those light

886
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,520
Speaker 7:  bulbs. They don't have the the capa like they don't have the hardware in

887
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,760
Speaker 7:  them to support this. They they have to.

888
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,440
Speaker 6:  Right. Because the bridge is, the bridge does all of the actual

889
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,400
Speaker 7:  Work, bridges all the work. So I, I'm really excited to never use the Phillips

890
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,320
Speaker 7:  Hue light app ever again. Just a terrifically

891
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,040
Speaker 7:  terrible app.

892
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,200
Speaker 6:  That app is trash.

893
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,240
Speaker 7:  And I'm really excited and every couple of years they're like, we redid it

894
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,920
Speaker 7:  and it's the same but a slightly d

895
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,720
Speaker 5:  This is why I end up, this is why I have a raspberry pie. Yeah. Right.

896
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:22,320
Speaker 5:  Just,

897
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,680
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Home fridge makes everything better.

898
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,640
Speaker 5:  It's so this, this, I'm excited for matter just to get, I mean I love this.

899
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,480
Speaker 5:  It's like a tomagotchi that runs my thermostat. Yeah. Like I have to

900
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,040
Speaker 5:  feed and care for it and I'm like, if I don't like check it every day, it'll

901
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,640
Speaker 5:  buy like it's my little lineage pet. Give

902
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:39,840
Speaker 7:  It a little

903
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,720
Speaker 5:  Pet and I know if it's working or not. Because we can, we can set the

904
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,640
Speaker 5:  thermostat on our phones without using the Nest app. It's the whole game.

905
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:51,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm excited to, I mean I'm like, I'm,

906
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,320
Speaker 5:  I think bittersweet. Like I might send it off to college. Aww. And

907
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,000
Speaker 5:  now we're gonna have matter instead. But it's, it's that thing where, because

908
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,800
Speaker 5:  I have a Nest thermostat, I need to have middleware in my house,

909
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,120
Speaker 5:  extremely brittle self-install middleware in my house

910
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:09,920
Speaker 5:  to just make it convenient. And that's what the HU lights have been for so

911
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,760
Speaker 5:  long. Yeah.

912
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,200
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

913
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:15,080
Speaker 5:  Well I mean I, there's like more bits

914
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:19,040
Speaker 5:  and bobs here that need to come out. Like I'm just hesitant to

915
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:23,000
Speaker 5:  say on this podcast of all podcasts the word thread border router

916
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,760
Speaker 5:  And this is like, this is where it belongs. That's where that vocabulary

917
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,520
Speaker 5:  belongs. Yeah. Yes. And like what needs to happen is

918
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,360
Speaker 5:  every router, every wifi router needs to have a thread radio in

919
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,310
Speaker 5:  it so that they're all thread border routers.

920
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,550
Speaker 6:  Is this when we should litigate the difference between matter over wifi and

921
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:43,270
Speaker 6:  matter over thread and how they're actually different things and and matter

922
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:45,910
Speaker 6:  is actually an umbrella term that describes several different things. Yes.

923
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:46,750
Speaker 5:  Yes. I think this is,

924
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:47,470
Speaker 6:  I

925
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,190
Speaker 5:  Is hesitant and it's like

926
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,710
Speaker 6:  I don't want to, David

927
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,350
Speaker 5:  Just man into

928
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:52,390
Speaker 6:  The

929
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,390
Speaker 5:  Is an umbrella. You

930
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,870
Speaker 6:  Did it. I would like to leave, I hate this. I'm

931
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:01,750
Speaker 5:  Sorry. Yeah. Matters. The control standard. It's the how everything

932
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,030
Speaker 5:  talks to each other standard.

933
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,750
Speaker 7:  But it uses a bunch of different technologies

934
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:09,710
Speaker 5:  They can operate in. The big move is that it uses

935
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,270
Speaker 5:  IP instead of some other, I mean this stuff is so wonky. They've been talking

936
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:17,070
Speaker 5:  about it for years. Yeah. And it's like, so you guys, after five

937
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:21,030
Speaker 5:  years of argument, you decided to use IP packets

938
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,230
Speaker 5:  instead of some other weirdo riff and they're like, I would've

939
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:28,470
Speaker 7:  Was just shocking. Yeah. Just shocking. We are gonna see some other new

940
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:32,230
Speaker 7:  technology coming to matter. They're gonna start supporting garage door

941
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:35,510
Speaker 7:  controllers, which could be fun. Electronic gates.

942
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,550
Speaker 7:  That

943
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,270
Speaker 5:  One's fun. That's all just doors. You described two different kinds of doors.

944
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:39,950
Speaker 7:  They're just doing doors,

945
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:42,990
Speaker 5:  Doors, big doors set at Hope. They're,

946
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:46,030
Speaker 7:  They're gonna do doors. You're gonna soon be able to open and close your

947
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:48,830
Speaker 7:  door without having to have Home Bridge installed. Which is really exciting.

948
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,190
Speaker 5:  Dream my garage openers home already.

949
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:54,550
Speaker 7:  But I think they're one that's kind of like interesting is the ambient,

950
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:57,830
Speaker 7:  the tiniest

951
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:00,470
Speaker 6:  Doors be around now. And I'm like, what if I just never had to open a door

952
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,430
Speaker 6:  again? What if all my doors were just magically open,

953
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,430
Speaker 7:  Needed them to, they open, it's great. Woo.

954
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:05,990
Speaker 5:  I

955
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:07,430
Speaker 6:  Could carry two beverages at the same

956
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:10,230
Speaker 5:  Time. Doesn't matter. Door committee is like, all right, next we're doing

957
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:13,230
Speaker 5:  big doors and after that I don't want to hear it Tom. We're not doing medium

958
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:14,750
Speaker 5:  doors, we're going straight to small doors.

959
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,190
Speaker 7:  Tiny. The tiny like the little fairy

960
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,030
Speaker 5:  Doors, medium doors suck it. Right.

961
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,950
Speaker 5:  Ambient something.

962
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,910
Speaker 7:  But I think, I think the big one is gonna be the, the ambient motion and

963
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:29,510
Speaker 7:  presence sensing. Okay. Because that's a weird technology that like Matter

964
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:32,830
Speaker 7:  itself is a whole bunch of different standards spread all around, right?

965
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:36,230
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Like, like links has, we're gonna bounce the wifi

966
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:40,110
Speaker 7:  off of you to know exactly where you are in your house at all times. Which

967
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,950
Speaker 7:  is both awesome and terrifying. Yeah. And then you also have like

968
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:47,670
Speaker 7:  the weird ultrasound sensing in the motion detecting in cameras and stuff.

969
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,670
Speaker 7:  So all of that is gonna soon come into matter soon. I say

970
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,590
Speaker 7:  soon it is still matter. It still could be like four years from

971
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,710
Speaker 7:  now when we finally get this. But,

972
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:01,950
Speaker 5:  But the dream here is that you can buy all these different

973
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,390
Speaker 5:  kinds of devices. Yeah. And it doesn't matter if you're a Google Home person

974
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:05,750
Speaker 5:  or

975
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:06,990
Speaker 7:  A home Care doesn't matter at all.

976
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,990
Speaker 5:  Oh my god Alex, I'm trying so hard

977
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,070
Speaker 6:  Here. I gave you one Alex this

978
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:15,670
Speaker 5:  One, this is why it was delayed. Like they just kept getting

979
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:18,110
Speaker 5:  sidetracked by their own wordplay. They're

980
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,270
Speaker 7:  Like, these puns are so good.

981
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:22,790
Speaker 5:  They're like we gotta get back to work. Someone in the background was like,

982
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:23,630
Speaker 5:  none of this matters.

983
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,710
Speaker 7:  Do you think they have like a big sign? It's like absolutely no puns beyond

984
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:30,750
Speaker 7:  this point just no like instant termination.

985
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:31,710
Speaker 5:  It's work time.

986
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:34,870
Speaker 5:  Start writing that spec.

987
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:40,430
Speaker 5:  The problem with that is all the like you can make it taken by motion

988
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:43,430
Speaker 5:  sensors from any company and door locks from any company and like cobble

989
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:47,590
Speaker 5:  together your own security system. But if people wanna buy is

990
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:51,430
Speaker 5:  like complete integrated products. So like is Ring gonna

991
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:55,190
Speaker 5:  fully participate or are they gonna hold back some features for their

992
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:57,510
Speaker 5:  proprietary riff? Right. Like but

993
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,190
Speaker 7:  I mean probably Yeah

994
00:55:59,570 --> 00:55:59,990
Speaker 5:  But

995
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:03,870
Speaker 6:  Isn't the goal of Matter to make that a false dichotomy that

996
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:07,630
Speaker 6:  like what we have now is an integrated ecosystem no matter

997
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,430
Speaker 6:  what you buy that. Like in theory what should happen now is

998
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:15,270
Speaker 6:  I can control, I have all of my controllers work and all I have to do

999
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:18,910
Speaker 6:  is attach something to my network once and it talks to all of my devices

1000
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:22,510
Speaker 6:  through all of my devices. And that's so like the thing Ring has done, which

1001
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:26,240
Speaker 6:  is like build itself a beautiful little wall of garden in theory eventually

1002
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,040
Speaker 6:  becomes like redundant and unnecessary. And to me what's super exciting

1003
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,560
Speaker 6:  about that is you get to a future where the bar for building this stuff

1004
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,480
Speaker 6:  is super, super, super low. Because right now if you wanna build like an

1005
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,720
Speaker 6:  actually competitive smart home thing, even if it's just like a dumb little

1006
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,560
Speaker 6:  like water sensor. Yeah. It's so much work and you have to build so

1007
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,440
Speaker 6:  much new software every single time. And a lot of them choose Alexa because

1008
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,600
Speaker 6:  Alexa has made that development easier than most. But then you only get one

1009
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,920
Speaker 6:  slower of the market. And then if you wanna do Home Kit, that's a whole separate

1010
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,920
Speaker 6:  thing. So a lot of companies are just giving up because like it's not worth,

1011
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,080
Speaker 6:  it's not worth the development work to get into this ecosystem. But if you

1012
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,520
Speaker 6:  can say like build it once and it will work for everywhere. It's like, it's

1013
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,000
Speaker 6:  like building a a web app and you can just like people can have it. That

1014
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,720
Speaker 6:  becomes kind of amazing. And I don't know like Matter is not gonna be there

1015
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,560
Speaker 6:  in the first iteration but like that's gotta be where this is headed and

1016
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,720
Speaker 6:  it's supposed to be where this is headed.

1017
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:18,560
Speaker 7:  I think Neil was saying that like, like a web app. What if the web app gives

1018
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,520
Speaker 7:  you way different features than the app that you install on your phone? Yeah.

1019
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,320
Speaker 5:  Like Ring wants you to open their apps so they can sell you more ring cameras.

1020
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:29,560
Speaker 5:  Like I have Ring it says like you have an order, you open it and then

1021
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,080
Speaker 5:  you like go to the home screen. It's like have you thought about buying more

1022
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,320
Speaker 5:  cameras? Right. Like they want, they do want you in their apps in some way.

1023
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:35,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1024
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,760
Speaker 6:  But now I don't have to Open Rings app. This is the beauty of Matter.

1025
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:40,280
Speaker 5:  I

1026
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,960
Speaker 6:  Don't ever have to use the Philips app or the Ring app ever again as long

1027
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:43,360
Speaker 6:  as I

1028
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,560
Speaker 5:  Can. But that desire is not gonna go away. Right. Like the business model

1029
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,080
Speaker 5:  for these companies cannot be, you sell a water sensor once and you walk

1030
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:50,360
Speaker 5:  away.

1031
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:54,040
Speaker 7:  I think like the example is, so the Phillips HU app, Terrible garbage

1032
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:57,640
Speaker 7:  hate it, The worst thing in the world. But what it does really cool that

1033
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,000
Speaker 7:  I can't do on the Apple Home app is make all my lights mimic

1034
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:05,200
Speaker 7:  candlelight. Yeah. Like I wanna sit at and read a book and pretend

1035
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,200
Speaker 7:  like I have a roaring fire in my home. I

1036
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,720
Speaker 6:  Can, I love when all my lights flicker

1037
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,040
Speaker 7:  All the time. It's great. It makes total sense. I play a little jazz, have

1038
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,240
Speaker 7:  a little cocktail. It's really, it's a nice moment. Alice

1039
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,400
Speaker 5:  Just hammered me like make flicker. Yeah

1040
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:20,480
Speaker 7:  Flicker faster. It's great.

1041
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:27,640
Speaker 7:  But you can't do that with the home app. Like, and and I don't

1042
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:31,360
Speaker 7:  see them changing that anytime soon. And so if I wanna

1043
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,240
Speaker 7:  do that I have to go and go there and get through all those ads for other

1044
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,280
Speaker 7:  HU lights that I don't need.

1045
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,800
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think that this is what watching this play out is gonna be what

1046
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,480
Speaker 5:  features do these companies hold back for their weirdo riffs? Yeah.

1047
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,920
Speaker 5:  Yes. And what features are the commodity features? And I we, we have no idea

1048
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,800
Speaker 5:  but you can see it play out across

1049
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,240
Speaker 5:  every other standard. Like AirPods are technically Bluetooth

1050
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:56,560
Speaker 7:  Technically,

1051
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:00,560
Speaker 5:  But Yeah. But Apple is special Bluetooth. It's better

1052
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,320
Speaker 5:  than the Bluetooth everybody else gets So Nas, BBC negative. It's rare that

1053
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,440
Speaker 5:  we see a new standard launch.

1054
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:08,480
Speaker 7:  Well it's gonna go, there's an, there's an optimistic side to this. Yeah.

1055
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,160
Speaker 7:  And I think that David was touching on that earlier in that you're still,

1056
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,040
Speaker 7:  if you just wanna go and buy a cheap sensor and plug it into your house

1057
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,840
Speaker 7:  and you don't need fancy features now you can just go do that.

1058
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,320
Speaker 7:  Yeah. You wanna go buy a cheap light and you don't care if it does

1059
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:27,200
Speaker 7:  candlelight great. You can just go do that.

1060
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:31,120
Speaker 7:  So those, those premium ones are still gonna be there to say hey give

1061
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,800
Speaker 7:  me extra money and use my annoying app. And you get cooler new

1062
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,640
Speaker 7:  features. But for the vast majority of people they can just opt outta that

1063
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,400
Speaker 7:  and just be like, I just want lights that turn on when I get home.

1064
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,520
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm I, yeah, I don't

1065
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,360
Speaker 6:  Wanna think of my house as an ecosystem of hardware and software. Like

1066
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,520
Speaker 6:  my house is just my house. Like when I need a light I would like to buy a

1067
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,800
Speaker 6:  light. Yeah. Like and and we've ended up in this place where it's like every

1068
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,120
Speaker 6:  time like the

1069
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:55,520
Speaker 5:  The,

1070
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:59,400
Speaker 6:  I always joke with my wife that like anytime she changes anything it inevitably

1071
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,160
Speaker 6:  spirals into changing everything. Right? It's like we get a new rug and then

1072
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,280
Speaker 6:  it's like oh well now the bedspread doesn't work and then we paint the walls

1073
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,560
Speaker 6:  and now I'm tearing down the bathroom and it's all because we got a new fucking

1074
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,440
Speaker 6:  rug. And that's what the smart home is like now it's like you find

1075
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,400
Speaker 6:  one thing that is cool and you suddenly have to rip every wire out of your

1076
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,200
Speaker 6:  walls and replace it just so it all works with your old stuff

1077
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,360
Speaker 6:  and matter it in theory obviates that for regular people

1078
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:23,880
Speaker 6:  like me who do not wanna deal with

1079
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,480
Speaker 5:  It. So I've been thinking about this a lot in the context of maybe we'll

1080
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,320
Speaker 5:  move, like maybe we're gonna have a different house. And I'm like the only

1081
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,040
Speaker 5:  way to ethically sell my home is

1082
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,680
Speaker 5:  to just run away to not even tell

1083
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,440
Speaker 5:  people that there is a smart home stuff in it.

1084
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,800
Speaker 5:  Cuz if you start, you have to be like, all right, here's the first thing

1085
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,280
Speaker 5:  you need to do. There's 500 things in this house

1086
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:50,400
Speaker 5:  that think the wifi is named whatever the wifi is named.

1087
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:54,920
Speaker 5:  So you've gotta just, here you're gonna need a 40 foot ladder

1088
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:58,720
Speaker 5:  and there's a floodlight on the roof and you've gotta go press a tiny button

1089
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,480
Speaker 5:  on the side of it while holding your phone. It's like no,

1090
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,640
Speaker 5:  actually what I should do is just bail and be like, if you're interested

1091
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,040
Speaker 5:  in that floodlight, just like every other home in America, you're gonna discover

1092
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,400
Speaker 5:  what happened to the floodlight on your own.

1093
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,080
Speaker 7:  You can have a fun

1094
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,920
Speaker 5:  Adventure. I can't be putting on this like you can't put this amount of responsibility

1095
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:18,320
Speaker 5:  in someone else. There's a tiny tomagotchi in utility room

1096
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:20,560
Speaker 5:  if it makes the thermostat work,

1097
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,320
Speaker 6:  If you don't feed it, the house will burn down.

1098
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:28,560
Speaker 5:  You can't give this responsibility to someone. All you can do

1099
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,200
Speaker 5:  is like pack your bags and just walk off into the night and

1100
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,080
Speaker 7:  Be like, lose my number.

1101
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,360
Speaker 5:  Exactly.

1102
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:37,280
Speaker 7:  Realtor calls just hang up. Yeah

1103
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:40,280
Speaker 5:  Baby matter makes us better cuz all the stuff will just like still work together.

1104
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:44,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it won't be like, here's a collection of apps

1105
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:48,040
Speaker 5:  that runs the garage door. I hope you're

1106
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:48,920
Speaker 5:  okay with this.

1107
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:52,640
Speaker 7:  Well you're gonna have to wait because that's not coming yet. Yeah. It won't

1108
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,560
Speaker 7:  be supported by that

1109
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,280
Speaker 5:  Until matter supports garage

1110
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:55,840
Speaker 7:  Doors. Yeah,

1111
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:56,920
Speaker 5:  Right.

1112
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,440
Speaker 7:  Ethically

1113
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,480
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be great. We're gonna have to keep living in the woods. Last one

1114
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,720
Speaker 5:  just on matter, which is really cool Level locks or really cool the company

1115
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,440
Speaker 5:  level. They've had a secret thread radio and then the,

1116
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,080
Speaker 7:  That's the, that's the coolest thing in the world. Yeah. I I I love

1117
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,600
Speaker 7:  when somebody's like secretly we've been planning for this all along.

1118
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:14,920
Speaker 7:  Surprise. Yeah. You're just like,

1119
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,160
Speaker 5:  Oh what was the one Google Smart Hunt thing where secretly at in microphone

1120
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,360
Speaker 5:  all the time and it was, was that was the wrong thing to do. I'm sure. Do

1121
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:25,280
Speaker 5:  you remember this? It was like one of the Google security system things and

1122
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,480
Speaker 5:  they were like, it's had a microphone the whole time and everyone was like,

1123
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,040
Speaker 5:  no that's the wrong choice for you to

1124
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:29,880
Speaker 7:  Make Nest home

1125
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,960
Speaker 5:  Security. Yes. The Nest Home security hub had a microphone in it and Google

1126
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,720
Speaker 5:  was like surprise And everyone was like bad surprise, poor

1127
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,160
Speaker 7:  Surprise. Take it out. Nobody wants

1128
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,520
Speaker 5:  That. But we've a secret thread radio that makes our locks more compatible

1129
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,280
Speaker 5:  with more things. Great.

1130
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,080
Speaker 7:  Yeah and and level actually those locks look like real locks.

1131
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,200
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Which would probably be nice cuz part of the problem with most smart

1132
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:54,080
Speaker 7:  locks is super hackable actually you have a cool little hacking tool

1133
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:57,720
Speaker 7:  you can just like say hello, I'm in your house now.

1134
01:02:58,370 --> 01:02:59,920
Speaker 7:  So it's really nice.

1135
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,640
Speaker 5:  I gotta go to my house.

1136
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:06,440
Speaker 5:  I'll, I'll see you guys later do the, have fun with the third segment.

Speaker 5:  You get up. Can you go push that button on the roof that changes the wifi

1143
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,720
Speaker 5:  network for the floodlight. We'll have much more modern news. By the

Speaker 5:  and Thomas while they play with smart home gadgets.

1146
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,440

Speaker 5:  through some gadgets show. We'll be right back.

1157
01:05:56,230 --> 01:06:00,160
Speaker 5:  Okay, we're back. Should we talk about the Apple TV

1158
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,720
Speaker 5:  and what's going on with that? Or should we start talk about Amazon music?

1159
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,400
Speaker 6:  Let's do Amazon first. Yeah cause this was, this was like the sneaky big

1160
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,760
Speaker 6:  story of the week to me and I'm still surprised.

1161
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,840
Speaker 5:  One of the most popular stories on our site to

1162
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,200
Speaker 6:  Be Yeah,

1163
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,320
Speaker 7:  Yeah. People really like to read about Amazon

1164
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,280
Speaker 6:  Music and really hate the new Amazon music.

1165
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,800
Speaker 7:  Really, really hate

1166
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,640
Speaker 6:  It. Not all of them but some of them.

1167
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:23,280
Speaker 7:  I mean they basically turned Amazon music into Pandora.

1168
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:27,440
Speaker 5:  Well like a combos of Pandora and Spotify's free tier, like much

1169
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,280
Speaker 5:  more Spotify's free tier than Pandora. So we had Steve Boom

1170
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:35,080
Speaker 5:  who's the VP of Amazon Music on decoder. They had a big announcement, Amazon,

1171
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,960
Speaker 5:  the bundle of Amazon music that came free with Prime, which is not free

1172
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,720
Speaker 5:  at all. It's just a, it's just a, that we've chosen

1173
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,280
Speaker 5:  to use together. Yes. This expensive thing came with a thing that is not

1174
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,040
Speaker 5:  free, but it came with the thing

1175
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,160
Speaker 7:  You pay for this already.

1176
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's funny how they're like, this comes free with Prime and it's like,

1177
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:56,880
Speaker 5:  it's nothing about, this is free. So Amazon music, the music service that

1178
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,000
Speaker 5:  is included in your Amazon Prime subscription used to have

1179
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:04,520
Speaker 5:  only 2 million tracks. Yeah. But it basically worked

1180
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,600
Speaker 5:  like any other premium music service. Like you put songs, you could make

1181
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,560
Speaker 5:  a playlist, you could whatever. Just the way that you thought Apple

1182
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:16,480
Speaker 5:  Music or Spotify Premium worked, they have now changed it so that

1183
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,720
Speaker 5:  it has a hundred million tracks, which is effectively the major

1184
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:23,200
Speaker 5:  label catalogs like all of the popular music in America.

1185
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:24,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1186
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,480
Speaker 5:  And you can pick, you can ask for one song at a time. You can like

1187
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:32,080
Speaker 5:  be like, play this one Taylor Swift song to Alexa. It'll play that song.

1188
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:36,560
Speaker 6:  No, not even. So thi this is where it kind of falls apart. So the way

1189
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,440
Speaker 6:  it works basically is you're just in shuffle mode all the time. Like Pandora,

1190
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,400
Speaker 6:  if you go to midnights by Taylor Swift and you hit play, whatever song you

1191
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,440
Speaker 6:  click on, it will just shuffle songs from that album. It won't start with

1192
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,320
Speaker 6:  the one that you picked. Maybe it will by accident but it won't, it'll just

1193
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,760
Speaker 6:  shuffle through the album. If you pick an artist, it'll shuffle through the

1194
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,080
Speaker 6:  artist. If you pick a playlist, it'll shuffle through the playlist. My favorite

1195
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,680
Speaker 6:  thing that has happened so far is like you people release singles and they,

1196
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,520
Speaker 6:  they look on these services like albums with one song. You

1197
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,280
Speaker 6:  go to that album, I thought this was gonna be like a loophole. I was like

1198
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,800
Speaker 6:  oh it'll shuffle the album but there's only one song so I win. You click

1199
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,680
Speaker 6:  on it and it just plays a completely different song.

1200
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:14,680
Speaker 5:  It's

1201
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,800
Speaker 6:  Super jarring And, and this is the thing is like it does functionally work

1202
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,680
Speaker 6:  like Pandora or in a lot of ways like Spotify is freeze here you

1203
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:26,560
Speaker 6:  get a limited number of skips. You're mostly designed to be using

1204
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,440
Speaker 6:  it as sort of background music. It's very much like a put it on

1205
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,960
Speaker 6:  at the beginning of the party and don't touch it for six hours kind of music

1206
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,120
Speaker 6:  experience. Can

1207
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:37,840
Speaker 7:  You blacklist songs? Like if I wanna listen to cats

1208
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:41,800
Speaker 7:  and be like I don't wanna hear Mr. Musto, I just, I

1209
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,640
Speaker 7:  want everything else from Cats.

1210
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:47,400
Speaker 6:  First of all, ski shakes, the Rail cat is the only good song from cats. But

1211
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:47,880
Speaker 6:  we don't need

1212
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:49,240
Speaker 5:  To my show. Right. Not

1213
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:49,720
Speaker 7:  Memories.

1214
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:53,880
Speaker 5:  I need this to stop. Right. We did, we've made

1215
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,640
Speaker 5:  weed jokes. Alex said Lima twice

1216
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,160
Speaker 7:  Other Alex

1217
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,120
Speaker 5:  This is over.

1218
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:00,440
Speaker 6:  Fair

1219
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,760
Speaker 5:  Enough. Putting my foot down

1220
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:06,160
Speaker 6:  And and the funny thing about this is this like as a music streaming

1221
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,600
Speaker 6:  strategy, perfectly valid, right? This is like a thing a lot of folks do.

1222
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:13,480
Speaker 6:  It's i it it is just how some systems work I think

1223
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:17,840
Speaker 6:  as far as I can understand it is, it is basically cheaper

1224
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:21,160
Speaker 6:  to run a service like this where you can't play the song you choose, you

1225
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,600
Speaker 6:  just sort of get music as opposed to giving people like True on demand.

1226
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:28,680
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Click the song and play the song music makes perfect sense. The

1227
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:32,560
Speaker 6:  problem is it's a total 180 in how it works from what

1228
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,440
Speaker 6:  Amazon music used to be. Which like you I said is smaller library but

1229
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,200
Speaker 6:  basically total access and I should say the new Amazon music has

1230
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,680
Speaker 6:  a set of playlists that it calls all access playlists and those

1231
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:46,680
Speaker 6:  you can interact with however you want. And those are like, you know, big

1232
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,600
Speaker 6:  hits and some stuff like that. So it's, it's both confusing and a

1233
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,360
Speaker 6:  total change from what people who are using this are used to. So my my

1234
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,400
Speaker 6:  guess would be if you've never used Apple Music before and you open it up

1235
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,320
Speaker 6:  and you're like oh tight all the music is here, I'm gonna like throw on a

1236
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,480
Speaker 6:  drive playlist while, while I'm on my commute this morning. Like that's a

1237
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:08,280
Speaker 6:  great experience. But for people who have like curated their own playlists

1238
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:12,160
Speaker 6:  in Apple Music that now don't work the way they expected or can't go

1239
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,080
Speaker 6:  listen to the music they had found there or what some people are saying,

1240
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:18,960
Speaker 6:  they've bought music that Amazon has now put behind the paywall

1241
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:23,080
Speaker 6:  and won't give them that kind of on-demand access to like I can see why you'd

1242
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,960
Speaker 6:  be pissed. They basically just like upended the whole experience for you

1243
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,440
Speaker 6:  for something that I think a lot of people weren't really asking for.

1244
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:32,520
Speaker 5:  Well two things. One, you said Apple Music there twice when you met Amazon

1245
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,720
Speaker 5:  Music. But I think the listeners will

1246
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:34,600
Speaker 6:  Forget this didn't mean Amazon Music.

1247
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,760
Speaker 5:  I'm sorry. That's fine. We'll get over it. Or will we?

1248
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,120
Speaker 6:  It's the one that doesn't have Zalo, that's all I know.

1249
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:44,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Two, in talking to Steve Boom, you know the Amazon

1250
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,080
Speaker 5:  music has been really targeted at the bottom 80% of

1251
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,760
Speaker 5:  music consumers. Yeah. Which is fascinating, right? Like they're like this

1252
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,160
Speaker 5:  is the thing when you ask Alexa for a song, it just needs to play the song

1253
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:57,680
Speaker 5:  and most people don't spend a lot of money on music. So we're going to

1254
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:01,040
Speaker 5:  go here, we're gonna find the 80% of people who don't spend a lot of money

1255
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,560
Speaker 5:  in music and make the product for them and it's gonna be bundled with Prime

1256
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,360
Speaker 5:  so they just use it.

1257
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,080
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was really interesting that he said to you that

1258
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,560
Speaker 6:  there's like a giant subset of people who will never spend $10 a month on

1259
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,840
Speaker 6:  music. Cuz my impression was always that like all these companies assumed

1260
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,480
Speaker 6:  eventually everyone would do it. That it is like such a demonstrably good

1261
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,640
Speaker 6:  deal for people who listen to music that eventually it would get everybody.

1262
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:23,160
Speaker 6:  But he's like no there is clearly a maximum of people who will do that and

1263
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,120
Speaker 6:  word after everybody else. I just thought that was really interesting.

1264
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,720
Speaker 7:  Oh I'm one of those 80% I have Apple Music and that's just because I get

1265
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,280
Speaker 7:  it through one of my like I think my phone plan otherwise I'd be like, I'm

1266
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,200
Speaker 7:  not gonna pay for music, I'll just pirate it. I mean I

1267
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,040
Speaker 7:  will just listen on YouTube,

1268
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,800
Speaker 5:  Fire up to Plex server, let's do this thing. Yeah, I mean

1269
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,040
Speaker 5:  that, I think if you make that assumption, you're like these people don't

1270
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:44,760
Speaker 5:  care very much.

1271
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:45,320
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1272
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,360
Speaker 5:  Right. And so we can just like change the terms of the deal and

1273
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,080
Speaker 5:  like people, I think there's an assumption that people are just like wandering

1274
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,640
Speaker 5:  at me, like play some music Alexa and Alexa's like here's some stuff and

1275
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,160
Speaker 5:  that's the end of it. And the reality is that some people

1276
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:04,280
Speaker 5:  were actually very particular about their use of this service inside

1277
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,280
Speaker 5:  of 2 million tracks. And now that has changed and they're mad.

1278
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:09,920
Speaker 7:  Do they get that back? If they pay more? They do. Right? Because

1279
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,120
Speaker 5:  There's the premium service. Yeah. Yeah. And I think they're equally mad

1280
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:13,760
Speaker 5:  about being upsold.

1281
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:14,280
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

1282
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,160
Speaker 5:  We'll

1283
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,400
Speaker 7:  See, it's Twitter blue all over again.

1284
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,800
Speaker 5:  Everything is Twitter blue.

1285
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:18,480
Speaker 7:  It all goes

1286
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:22,040
Speaker 5:  Back to Twitter. You get a blue check mark if you pay for non shuffle playing

1287
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,920
Speaker 5:  Amazon Music, Chris Waltz review the Apple TV 4k, it's great. It's an Apple

1288
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,440
Speaker 5:  tv. They took out the fan, it's a little lighter. The chip is really fast,

1289
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:32,600
Speaker 5:  unnecessarily fast. The expensive one has thread. I just am

1290
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:36,400
Speaker 5:  bringing it up because there's a new TV feature that is going to

1291
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,560
Speaker 5:  make me upgrade my TVs between Matter and

1292
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:43,840
Speaker 5:  QMS V R on TVs. It's like I gotta upgrade, I gotta get new locks.

1293
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:46,000
Speaker 5:  I get new lights. I gotta, you

1294
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,640
Speaker 7:  Gotta get the TV that supports v r.

1295
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:51,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So it's called, it's not out yet. So the new Apple TV supports something

1296
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,240
Speaker 5:  called qms, V R R I don't know what the QMS stands for

1297
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,960
Speaker 5:  and I refuse to google it. No, that's not true.

1298
01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:00,200
Speaker 7:  I was like, I'm Googling it. Quick media switching.

1299
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:03,960
Speaker 5:  So there's a, the new Apple TV has something called QMS vr which is quick

1300
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,600
Speaker 5:  media switching variable refresh rate. So variable refresh rate as you know,

1301
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,080
Speaker 5:  can the just like promotion on your phone, the TVs can swing from

1302
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:13,040
Speaker 5:  24 hertz to 120.

1303
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,680
Speaker 7:  It's always gonna give you what looks nicest to

1304
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,280
Speaker 5:  Your eye. Yep. It's gonna match the content dynamically. It's not gonna blink

1305
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,920
Speaker 5:  out to black. And then QMS is quick media switching. So I think you just

1306
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,600
Speaker 5:  sent the, the thing you're playing can send a flag and it can switch the

1307
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,320
Speaker 5:  vrr really fast. Right. The Apple TV supports it. There are no TVs that support

1308
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,680
Speaker 5:  it yet. Which is hilarious cuz there are tons of TVs that support VR r. This

1309
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:34,360
Speaker 5:  seems like it should be, but a software update away. But the

1310
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,520
Speaker 5:  TV manufacturers continue to be TV manufacturers.

1311
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:38,840
Speaker 7:  Oh they're gonna make you

1312
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:41,000
Speaker 5:  Tv.

1313
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:45,480
Speaker 6:  I literally don't think you could've described a feature that sounds less

1314
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,160
Speaker 6:  interesting and worth upgrading. My tv

1315
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,320
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna upgrade my TV to this so fast.

1316
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,840
Speaker 6:  Okay, so you know how you're

1317
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,560
Speaker 5:  Watching tv Want the TV to blink out to black. I don't want it to happen.

1318
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,240
Speaker 7:  Well you could wait. You could also go and if your, if your TV already supports

1319
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,960
Speaker 7:  Vrr, somebody will absolutely find a hack. Yeah. In Hack

1320
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:02,640
Speaker 7:  qms on

1321
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,480
Speaker 5:  There. And I'm saying that the community of Twitter followers that I have

1322
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,760
Speaker 5:  built up is like, crap, I've gotta upgrade my tv

1323
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:13,280
Speaker 5:  so you're my people but this is the reason I'm gonna upgrade my Apple tv.

1324
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:16,400
Speaker 5:  It's the reason I'm finally gonna buy a new TV and then matters. How

1325
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,040
Speaker 6:  Many times a day would you say the refresh rate changes on your television

1326
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:19,800
Speaker 6:  in the eye? Let's talk this

1327
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,840
Speaker 5:  Through. It's not the refresh rate, it's the, it's the match content. So

1328
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,680
Speaker 5:  you can't run the interface in like Doby vision at one 20 and then

1329
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:30,640
Speaker 5:  go watch Netflix 24 standard sdr. You can't run

1330
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,320
Speaker 5:  the interface at like Doby Vision one 20 and then open Netflix

1331
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:38,440
Speaker 5:  and SDR 24 Hertz without like an htm. I refresh

1332
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,280
Speaker 5:  and an HTMI refresh

1333
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:42,240
Speaker 1:  To be aware of bad news.

1334
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:43,440
Speaker 5:  We gotta end the show.

1335
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:47,360
Speaker 1:  No, no. So I I am one of your people

1336
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:50,880
Speaker 1:  Eli and I was just telling David earlier, I want to

1337
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,160
Speaker 1:  change my tv. There's a limitation to qr.

1338
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:59,120
Speaker 1:  It only works for changing refresh rates without a

1339
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:03,200
Speaker 1:  the black screen. It does not work. Going from SDR to

1340
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:07,360
Speaker 1:  HDR or different versions of Adobe or

1341
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:08,440
Speaker 1:  HDR 10 plus.

1342
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:13,400
Speaker 5:  I can't, I can't abide my I know find me to QMS VR

1343
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,080
Speaker 5:  office. We're going there right now.

1344
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:16,960
Speaker 1:  Very frustrating

1345
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:21,280
Speaker 5:  Is the H D M I building in the shape of a giant h Find it on Google

1346
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,280
Speaker 5:  Maps. Let's go there. Everyone looked for the H on Google Maps.

1347
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,120
Speaker 5:  Well that sucks. Now I'm not buying etv. You had your chance lg.

1348
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:30,440
Speaker 7:  He's gonna be an lg.

1349
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:33,120
Speaker 6:  I feel vindicated somehow I feel like I won this fight.

1350
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,200
Speaker 7:  I still want it.

1351
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:34,720
Speaker 6:  I

1352
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,160
Speaker 7:  Do. I'm still gonna,

1353
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,080
Speaker 5:  I just wanna buy any tv.

1354
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:39,840
Speaker 7:  I know. Mine's five years old. I'm ready. It's time. Yeah

1355
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,840
Speaker 6:  Mine's, I will say that reading

1356
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,720
Speaker 5:  Garbage tv,

1357
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:42,600
Speaker 7:  How to get a new

1358
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,560
Speaker 6:  TV reading Chris's review and he, he keeps talking about how much unnecessary

1359
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,480
Speaker 6:  power there is inside of this box. All I can think after spending months

1360
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,440
Speaker 6:  sitting here, like begging my bro TV to load the app that I'm

1361
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:58,360
Speaker 6:  trying to load is like I will take unlimited power from my set top

1362
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,880
Speaker 6:  box. Like I, I would like six to seven times more power than I need from

1363
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:05,720
Speaker 6:  my set top box because it's just, it is the worst. Like if my worst

1364
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,120
Speaker 6:  problem was that the screen flickered every once in a while, that'd be great.

1365
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:12,080
Speaker 6:  Now it's like I open the HBO Max app and four outta six

1366
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,080
Speaker 6:  times. It's just like ah, I'm gonna crash your television.

1367
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:18,880
Speaker 5:  I bought a smart projector last year and like over the course

1368
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,360
Speaker 5:  of this summer, it's like what if I didn't run Android? Yeah.

1369
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:26,320
Speaker 5:  Like what if I just like coughed and sneezed and was

1370
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,920
Speaker 5:  like here's why. Here's parts of this interface, the

1371
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:29,560
Speaker 7:  Media attack process.

1372
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:33,080
Speaker 6:  My TV is tired. My literally acts like it's tired.

1373
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:37,560
Speaker 6:  It's just like, alright, give a minute. Like yeah, I'll search for that for

1374
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,640
Speaker 6:  you. But like hold on.

1375
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:42,640
Speaker 5:  Hey Roku, 4K sticks are 25 bucks for Black Friday. I really? Yeah.

1376
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,200
Speaker 6:  But then I have to plug a Roku into my Roku tv. I like on principle,

1377
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:50,560
Speaker 6:  on principle I cannot do that. But I will buy an Apple TV that is

1378
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,840
Speaker 6:  unnecessarily powerful and expensive and plug it in into my Roku tv. Like

1379
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,120
Speaker 6:  yeah I will,

1380
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:58,080
Speaker 7:  I'm ready. Can you bypass that? Because I know with Roku it always like presents

1381
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,720
Speaker 7:  you the menu. Can you bypass that?

1382
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,400
Speaker 6:  I have to open my Roku. Yeah. The data with like I can do that with like

1383
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,160
Speaker 6:  great spite and anger. Like every time I open my Roku menu I can say no,

1384
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,640
Speaker 6:  no Roku to my Apple TV and then I'll feel like I've accomplished something.

1385
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,560
Speaker 5:  You know there's a chart at Apple there. It's like we've got this many a

1386
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,760
Speaker 5:  15 s out in the world under TVs. We're about to become a gaming powerhouse.

1387
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:21,120
Speaker 5:  And then like Tim Click is like, but I hate video games. And that's

1388
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,000
Speaker 5:  where that conversation, that conversation's gonna hit that brick wall every

1389
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,480
Speaker 5:  time. That's why the Apple TVs unnecessarily powerful cause they think it's

1390
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,280
Speaker 5:  a game console. Yes. And if they can just get enough

1391
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,160
Speaker 5:  eighteens underneath,

1392
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,960
Speaker 7:  Nobody tell them nobody to tell them. I want my unnecessarily powerful

1393
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:40,000
Speaker 7:  set top box. Yeah. On it. Yeah. I don't want

1394
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,680
Speaker 7:  Roku so like just nobody tells him cook about this. We're all buying it for

1395
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,800
Speaker 7:  the games, Tim. It's the only reason it's

1396
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,440
Speaker 5:  All gonna happen. Speaking last little bit of streaming news, Netflix

1397
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:54,040
Speaker 5:  ads plan came out today it's $7 a month and sign

1398
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,040
Speaker 5:  up for it doesn't work on the Apple TV at launch,

1399
01:17:56,290 --> 01:18:00,160
Speaker 7:  Doesn't work on the Apple TV at launch. A surprising number, a

1400
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:04,080
Speaker 7:  surprising amount of content doesn't work. And you get a

1401
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,880
Speaker 7:  big padlock sign and then when you click it's like,

1402
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:11,120
Speaker 7:  Hey, we noticed you clicked on this movie you wanted to watch. Would you

1403
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,440
Speaker 7:  like to give us money? So that's why it doesn't work on Apple tv because

1404
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,000
Speaker 5:  No, I

1405
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,440
Speaker 7:  Mean that's

1406
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:20,280
Speaker 5:  What I, No, Netflix gave a statement to nine to five Mac and they

1407
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:20,800
Speaker 5:  said it's coming.

1408
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,880
Speaker 7:  Okay, it's coming. Once they figure out how to get around the 30%,

1409
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:27,600
Speaker 5:  Well or they're just gonna remove the the tout to actually pay money.

1410
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we'll see. But it doesn't wear your launch. I, you know, I'm assuming

1411
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:31,360
Speaker 5:  that

1412
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,160
Speaker 7:  They're gonna email

1413
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,320
Speaker 5:  You. They're gonna email,

1414
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:33,920
Speaker 7:  It'll be fine.

1415
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:37,920
Speaker 5:  They're gonna get a big fight. But it's out. Now you can read Jay

1416
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,680
Speaker 5:  wrote about, Yeah

1417
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,880
Speaker 7:  Jay Jay wrote about it. He, he tried it out for a few hours and it seems

1418
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,360
Speaker 7:  to be just digital advertising. It's like Hulu and stuff where there's no

1419
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,880
Speaker 7:  rhyme or reason to win. The advertisements will pop up. So when there are

1420
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,280
Speaker 7:  those natural breaks, instead of it being there, it's gonna be like mid-sentence.

1421
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:56,640
Speaker 7:  I love, Would you like to buy some Tide pods? Oh my God, it's gonna be great.

1422
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:00,400
Speaker 7:  Exciting. There's still a lot to figure out there. They should probably look

1423
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,840
Speaker 7:  to broadcast television because they figured out this whole advertising thing

1424
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:07,920
Speaker 7:  decades ago. But he seems to like it overall. He's like yeah

1425
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,280
Speaker 7:  if you, if you don't wanna be paying as much.

1426
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:13,200
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. So on the Netflix app, on iOS devices

1427
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:17,480
Speaker 5:  like phones, it just basically says you need an

1428
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:20,640
Speaker 5:  ad free plan. It doesn't let you buy it. Yeah, well they'll do that on the

1429
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,040
Speaker 5:  tv I'm sure they just have to like get through some weird app. It doesn't

1430
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,680
Speaker 5:  work on older Chromecast either.

1431
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,000
Speaker 7:  Right. And it's not gonna work on probably a lot of your older Rokus too.

1432
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,840
Speaker 7:  David, I'm sorry, does it work on yours? You have to test it out over

1433
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:33,000
Speaker 7:  it.

1434
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,240
Speaker 6:  Just roll. Give me like 45 minutes for the Netflix app to load. And I'll

1435
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:36,440
Speaker 6:  tell you

1436
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:41,160
Speaker 5:  Also the video quality is locked at seven 20 p and there's no offline

1437
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,280
Speaker 5:  downloads. I don't know, I

1438
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:45,440
Speaker 6:  Think are, are you, this strikes me as a fairly clear

1439
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:49,280
Speaker 6:  way for Netflix to get people in and then try to get them to upgrade, which

1440
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:53,080
Speaker 6:  I guess I underestimated the extent to which it was

1441
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,640
Speaker 6:  gonna be that like this is not like just as good but with ads,

1442
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,520
Speaker 6:  this is worse. Netflix for,

1443
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:01,080
Speaker 7:  You can't even watch Arrested Development. None of Arrested

1444
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,160
Speaker 6:  Development. What I'm saying like it's, it's, it's very clear that this Netflix

1445
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:07,720
Speaker 6:  is looking at this like a gateway drug to a fully paid Netflix plan hundred.

1446
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:09,720
Speaker 6:  Like a real swing at advertising, right?

1447
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:13,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah, no I, well I don't know. I was gonna be really stru about that

1448
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,920
Speaker 5:  but I've, I've in five seconds tone my opinion down.

1449
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:21,280
Speaker 5:  So the comparison I was gonna make is if you're gonna do that then you might

1450
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,840
Speaker 5:  as well do Spotify free and actually just make it free and let the ads pay

1451
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,000
Speaker 5:  for the

1452
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,120
Speaker 6:  Free shuffle Netflix

1453
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:28,600
Speaker 5:  Shuffle Netflix. Like why not? You

1454
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,240
Speaker 7:  Know, like what are you watching today? You find

1455
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:34,040
Speaker 5:  Out. But Spotify free is really important to Spotify. Yeah,

1456
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:37,600
Speaker 5:  it is the most important part of their product. It is the thing they give

1457
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,800
Speaker 5:  away and everybody has it and it is designed to make you start to pay for

1458
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,480
Speaker 5:  Spotify and it's the top of the funnel. So they care a lot about

1459
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:48,320
Speaker 5:  Spotify free. It's the thing they make. Netflix got dragged kicking

1460
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:52,000
Speaker 5:  and streaming to Netflix with ads, right? Yeah. Like they fair kind of don't

1461
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,920
Speaker 5:  wanna make it. They've had to, they've reduced the price. It's still $7 so

1462
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,760
Speaker 5:  you still have to pay for it. And then you get these ads and the ads are

1463
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,560
Speaker 5:  where the money is supposed to come from cuz Netflix has this theoretically

1464
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:04,160
Speaker 5:  huge audience. So they're, I think they're just kind of stuck in the middle.

1465
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:08,120
Speaker 5:  Like they haven't built the Let's capture everyone and get

1466
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,880
Speaker 5:  them to pay us cuz it's still not free. Gotta get $7 a month outta

1467
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:15,640
Speaker 5:  people and they haven't built the, this is worth $7 a month and you have

1468
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,000
Speaker 5:  to watch ads.

1469
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,480
Speaker 7:  They've got a lot of contracts they have to get through too. So, So J's piece

1470
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:22,720
Speaker 7:  noted that some of the stuff that's not available now is gonna be available

1471
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,240
Speaker 7:  later. And that's just because like they have to go back to these people

1472
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:29,080
Speaker 7:  and be like, Hey, we signed a deal with you that we would just stream this

1473
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:33,000
Speaker 7:  movie now we wanna put ads on it. Yeah. Can we do that without giving

1474
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,480
Speaker 7:  you more money? And I don't think they can,

1475
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:40,480
Speaker 5:  I just think they should have done a free with ads tier in addition to this

1476
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,240
Speaker 5:  one. Yeah. Like if you did free with ads and then you did $7

1477
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,360
Speaker 5:  with like some ads and maybe 10 80 p like

1478
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,160
Speaker 7:  Full efforts like free with this, with this limited library. Yeah. And

1479
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:55,080
Speaker 7:  then $7 with the whole library in ads and maybe that's

1480
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,080
Speaker 7:  the plan. And so we're all gonna be really delighted when that happens because

1481
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,600
Speaker 7:  it'll be an improvement from this. I wouldn't, I

1482
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,840
Speaker 6:  Mean we that out, we all paid a crap ton of money for cable subscriptions

1483
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,320
Speaker 6:  that still had a lot of ads. So like I, I don't know that money plus ads

1484
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:11,360
Speaker 6:  is all that shocking of behavior. Yeah, that's true. But it

1485
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,160
Speaker 6:  would be interesting to see Netflix be like, okay, you can get it for free

1486
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:18,160
Speaker 6:  but every hour it's gonna be 30 minutes of ads. Are you ready for this?

1487
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,040
Speaker 6:  Like, here we

1488
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,800
Speaker 5:  Go. I feel compelled at this time to disclose. We made a Netflix show.

1489
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,840
Speaker 5:  It's very good. It's called The Future of, I'm hopelessly biased in favor

1490
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,080
Speaker 5:  of it. I think you should watch it no matter what your plan. Also

1491
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,760
Speaker 5:  Comcast is an investor in the Fox media or parent

1492
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,720
Speaker 5:  company. You know, I don't care what Peacock does at this time, but they

1493
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,640
Speaker 5:  exist and they run a competitive streaming service.

1494
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:42,960
Speaker 7:  Should we, I feel like that's a good segue to talk about Comcast.

1495
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:44,200
Speaker 5:  Just in general.

1496
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,800
Speaker 7:  Just in general. No, they, they have their own rival to Roku

1497
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,760
Speaker 7:  speaking of, and they said a while back they announced that they in charter

1498
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,760
Speaker 7:  were gonna be partnering together and doing their own hardware ecosystem

1499
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:59,000
Speaker 7:  and they finally have a name for it and it's called Zuma. Yeah.

1500
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,440
Speaker 7:  And it's the exact same name that they already were using for a software

1501
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:06,480
Speaker 7:  suite. So that's kind of of interesting. I, I don't know, I think it's

1502
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,720
Speaker 7:  interesting mainly because of Roku and, and how this is really a play for

1503
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:13,680
Speaker 7:  that super cheap set top box because a lot of people have Roku TVs and these

1504
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,840
Speaker 7:  aging TVs and they are not going to go and pay a thousand dollars

1505
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,760
Speaker 7:  to have qms V R R and instead they're just gonna be like, I

1506
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,520
Speaker 7:  want a cheap set top box to play me the things and Charter and

1507
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:29,040
Speaker 7:  Comcast are like, we'll do it and it'll be called Zoomo.

1508
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,040
Speaker 7:  I'm just that name.

1509
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:34,880
Speaker 6:  When I moved into my current house, we, we signed up for Comcast and they

1510
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,680
Speaker 6:  literally sent me a set top box, which back then was called

1511
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,040
Speaker 6:  Flex and I believe their flex program is now what's turning into zoomo

1512
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:46,520
Speaker 6:  for free. And I literally was like, I don't want it. I have set top boxes,

1513
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:50,320
Speaker 6:  I'm good. And he was just like, ah, we'll send you one. Like it, I think

1514
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:54,000
Speaker 6:  you're right that it's it's they want to be in this platform

1515
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,760
Speaker 6:  game so badly. They've been trying this for years. Like nobody

1516
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:01,520
Speaker 6:  has tried more times with less success than Comcast

1517
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:04,880
Speaker 6:  to build Yeah. A real like set top box empire.

1518
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:08,240
Speaker 7:  It's really interesting because they do have this obsession with hardware

1519
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:12,760
Speaker 7:  and that that no, no other kind of companies do they all, they

1520
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:16,560
Speaker 7:  always want to own all of that hardware in your house and make you pay a

1521
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,240
Speaker 7:  leasing fee for it.

1522
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:20,720
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Remember when the X one was gonna be like the super computer of set

1523
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:24,440
Speaker 6:  top boxes and then everybody was like, the X one costs like six times too

1524
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,920
Speaker 6:  much money. Comcast Yeah, please leave me alone. I do not want your cable

1525
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,200
Speaker 6:  box.

1526
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:32,360
Speaker 7:  Like I think they're, they're addicted if anything to that

1527
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,120
Speaker 7:  leasing revenue stream and they're trying everything. They're trying their

1528
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:39,080
Speaker 7:  damn desk to keep ahold of it as they lose all these other elements of like

1529
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:42,080
Speaker 7:  cable is going away, cable is, you know, everybody says 10 years from now

1530
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:45,760
Speaker 7:  cable's gonna be dead and where is that gonna leave them with

1531
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,840
Speaker 7:  internet? And then ideally these set top boxes that they will charge you

1532
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,000
Speaker 7:  an arm and a leg for each month.

1533
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:54,320
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean, and just like looking at the, the home screen on my Roku, right?

1534
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:58,120
Speaker 6:  Like I I I turn on my television and right next to all of my apps,

1535
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:01,280
Speaker 6:  there's just a big ass ad on the right side and like, you know, who would

1536
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:05,120
Speaker 6:  like to be the one selling that ad is every media company on planet. Yep.

1537
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,600
Speaker 6:  So like it makes a lot of sense to me that that's a really competitive space

1538
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:12,360
Speaker 6:  and for Comcast, like as it gets harder and harder to sell people cable

1539
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,880
Speaker 6:  subscriptions, like owning the box where people look at their television

1540
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:19,320
Speaker 6:  is going to be a lucrative space. Right. Like Roku has continued to prove

1541
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:22,920
Speaker 6:  that and it's, it's gonna keep working for any company that can actually

1542
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:26,440
Speaker 6:  figure out how to pull this off. What's crazy to me is how few

1543
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:30,360
Speaker 6:  have actually been able to like, it's been a long time since there was

1544
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:33,520
Speaker 6:  an interesting new player in this space and like I certainly don't think

1545
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:37,400
Speaker 6:  Zoomo is gonna change that. Yeah. But like, I guess kudos to Comcast

1546
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:40,040
Speaker 6:  for, I mean I think continuing to bang its head against this particular,

1547
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:43,480
Speaker 5:  I think you guys have done an excellent job laying out the strategic case

1548
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:47,240
Speaker 5:  for Comcast to make this product fine. They called it Zuma

1549
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:47,840
Speaker 5:  with an ex

1550
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:52,280
Speaker 5:  like z u o. Like

1551
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,000
Speaker 6:  This is the important part. This

1552
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,560
Speaker 7:  Is this. Yeah. That's the whole name.

1553
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:59,560
Speaker 5:  They, they, we live in a world where people do

1554
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:03,080
Speaker 5:  not really understand the difference between Roku and Hulu. Like, it's my

1555
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,480
Speaker 5:  favorite question that I've ever gotten from like the family. Like what is

1556
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:10,240
Speaker 5:  the differe? And they're like Zoomo on our X Class

1557
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:12,760
Speaker 5:  TVs running on Xfinity. It's like playing

1558
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:16,600
Speaker 7:  The software because it also has software and the software is called

1559
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,520
Speaker 7:  Zoomo play. So you gotta open the Sumo Play app on your zoomo.

1560
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:21,000
Speaker 7:  No

1561
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,640
Speaker 5:  Thank you. I I just don't

1562
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,720
Speaker 6:  Anything can I, can I propose something to you that I think is gonna slightly

1563
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:31,480
Speaker 6:  blow your mind? Yeah. Yeah. This name is a tremendous improvement

1564
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:35,120
Speaker 6:  over the streaming box that Comcast launched last year.

1565
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,520
Speaker 6:  Which which was spelled uppercase X, lowercase, i,

1566
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,880
Speaker 6:  uppercase o, lowercase and lowercase e.

1567
01:26:43,410 --> 01:26:44,160
Speaker 5:  No. Is it,

1568
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:46,280
Speaker 6:  Is it the, this is a real thing that happened.

1569
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,080
Speaker 7:  How do you say

1570
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:50,800
Speaker 6:  That? Is it and and all of the headlines you will find about this thing

1571
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:54,200
Speaker 6:  are about how I literally don't know how to pronounce the name. It's very

1572
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:58,040
Speaker 6:  good. This was Comcast last try. So Zoomo is, we're moving in the right

1573
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:58,280
Speaker 6:  direction.

1574
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:02,200
Speaker 7:  So does Comcast just have a room and they've got an X and they've got a

1575
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,440
Speaker 7:  whole bunch of vowels and they're just like, throw 'em at the wall. That's

1576
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,920
Speaker 6:  The name. Just like, it's like the refrigerator magnets, they just like whip

1577
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,760
Speaker 6:  'em at the refrigerator. I'm like, ah, there

1578
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,440
Speaker 7:  It's gotta have the X in. There's

1579
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,760
Speaker 5:  Transformative, it's Z one. But then they saw that with an X, I don't know

1580
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:15,240
Speaker 5:  man. Oh

1581
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:15,880
Speaker 6:  Z one could be

1582
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:19,480
Speaker 5:  Good. At the end of the day, Comcast is sad that they used to have two businesses.

1583
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:23,320
Speaker 5:  They sold cable television and in access. Yeah. And one business is

1584
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:26,800
Speaker 5:  going away and it's not the internet access business. So they, they're like,

1585
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,240
