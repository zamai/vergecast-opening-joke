00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:06,125
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of alternate keyboard

3
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:09,925
Speaker 2:  layouts. I'm your friend David Pierce, and I am sitting here at my

4
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:13,765
Speaker 2:  dining room table going through what I guess I like to call just

5
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:17,405
Speaker 2:  my tech crap bag. So a bunch of years ago I started

6
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:21,365
Speaker 2:  basically buying duplicates of all of my chargers and

7
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:25,365
Speaker 2:  plugs and cords and backup headphones just to

8
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:29,085
Speaker 2:  have one thing that I can just leave in a bag in my suitcase

9
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:33,245
Speaker 2:  at all times so I don't have to unplug everything from my room when I wanna

10
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:36,805
Speaker 2:  leave, I don't have to constantly be schlepping stuff back and forth. I kind

11
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:40,085
Speaker 2:  of leave everything where it is at home, and then I have this stuff for travel.

12
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:44,245
Speaker 2:  It has saved me so much time and so much effort and so much forgetting of

13
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:47,965
Speaker 2:  stuff over the years. I cannot recommend it enough, but when I travel

14
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:52,125
Speaker 2:  a bunch in a row, it gets like this. It's kind of messy

15
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:55,405
Speaker 2:  and tangled and I don't know where anything is, and there's a bunch of stuff

16
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:58,965
Speaker 2:  that's supposed to be in here that I'm sure is not in here. So every once

17
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:02,805
Speaker 2:  in a while I have to sit down and very quietly and lovingly

18
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:07,005
Speaker 2:  coil it all back up, put it back in neatly, and then slowly destroy it

19
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:10,565
Speaker 2:  again over time. Works out great. Makes me feel good. No regrets.

20
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:13,805
Speaker 2:  Anyway, we have an awesome show coming up for you today. We're gonna talk

21
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:17,685
Speaker 2:  about two different things. First, starting off with our

22
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:21,805
Speaker 2:  kind of accidental keyboard series that we're doing, we're gonna

23
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:25,685
Speaker 2:  talk to somebody who spent two years reinventing from the

24
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:29,325
Speaker 2:  ground up, how his keyboard works and how he uses it. It's a super fun story.

25
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:33,285
Speaker 2:  Then we're gonna talk to Tom Warren about a surprising amount of

26
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:37,045
Speaker 2:  change happening at Microsoft right now and what that means for its plans

27
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:40,605
Speaker 2:  for AI and its plans for Surface devices and what an AI

28
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:44,365
Speaker 2:  PC is and a whole bunch of other stuff. We're also gonna do a Hotline question.

29
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:47,885
Speaker 2:  We got a lot coming up this episode. All that is coming up in just a second.

30
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:52,005
Speaker 2:  But first I just discovered that one of these cables has finally come

31
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:55,925
Speaker 2:  like fully undone and doesn't charge anymore, and so I need to

32
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:59,205
Speaker 2:  buy the replacement. This thing has lived a long life. It's time for a new

33
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:01,245
Speaker 2:  one. This is The Vergecast. We'll see you in a sec.

34
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:11,805
Speaker 4:  your local agent today.

35
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:19,575
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Here's a question. How often do you think about your

36
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:23,655
Speaker 2:  keyboard? I think for most people the answer is never. You just like have

37
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:27,615
Speaker 2:  a keyboard on your Laptop or your phone, that's your keyboard. The end at

38
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:31,095
Speaker 2:  the very top end of the spectrum I think are the mechanical keyboard people

39
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:35,135
Speaker 2:  who obsess over switches and colors and all that kind of stuff. I think as

40
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:39,175
Speaker 2:  regular computer users go, that's about as intense as it

41
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:42,775
Speaker 2:  gets. But there is a community of people online who go much,

42
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:46,695
Speaker 2:  much deeper than that. And I recently got on a call with one of them who

43
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:49,775
Speaker 2:  spent an evening in his office in Sweden talking to me about keyboards.

44
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:53,895
Speaker 5:  I'm Jonas Jonas ler. I started computer science, but I

45
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:57,495
Speaker 5:  prefer to see myself as a self-talk developer.

46
00:03:58,055 --> 00:04:01,735
Speaker 2:  I found Jonas because over the last couple of years on his blog, he's been

47
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:05,415
Speaker 2:  keeping a journal of sorts about his attempt to build the perfect

48
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:09,215
Speaker 2:  keyboard because the keyboard he had, the ones that you and I use all day

49
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,975
Speaker 2:  without thinking much about them, wasn't working for him anymore. I mean,

50
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:16,655
Speaker 2:  it was fine in a certain sense, Jonas is a programmer and a pretty fast

51
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:17,175
Speaker 2:  typist.

52
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:21,415
Speaker 5:  I've never used these typing trainers or or websites or stuff, but I,

53
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:25,615
Speaker 5:  I think I typed in like 120 words per minute or something. It's,

54
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:29,255
Speaker 5:  it's okay, but it's not super incredible where when I started looking at

55
00:04:29,255 --> 00:04:32,535
Speaker 5:  this, it was actually when I got R-S-I-R-S-I,

56
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:36,335
Speaker 2:  By the way, stands for repetitive strain injury or repetitive stress

57
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:40,175
Speaker 2:  injury. It's an umbrella term for what essentially is a lot of problems caused

58
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:43,735
Speaker 2:  by doing the same thing the same way over and over and over again.

59
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:47,695
Speaker 5:  I started feeling pain in my hand, specifically my right hand.

60
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:51,975
Speaker 5:  I had also broken my, on the top of the hand close to the the

61
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:56,095
Speaker 5:  pinky. So when I started typing, I'm like, oh, pressing like enter

62
00:04:56,115 --> 00:04:58,895
Speaker 5:  and other keys with my pinky kind of hurt.

63
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:02,855
Speaker 2:  So the first thing Jonas thought was, okay, maybe I'll get an ergonomic keyboard.

64
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:06,935
Speaker 2:  One of those that's either split into or just has that kind of wavy

65
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:10,535
Speaker 2:  shape that's supposed to be less intense on your wrists and forearms.

66
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:12,455
Speaker 2:  He had actually tried these keyboards before,

67
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:16,815
Speaker 5:  Like 15 years ago or something. I was really into mechanical

68
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:20,975
Speaker 5:  keyboards, but at that time it was just, oh, pretty key caps. Oh, maybe

69
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:24,695
Speaker 5:  these switches that sound cool. Oh, look at how fast I'm typing. It

70
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:28,375
Speaker 5:  sounds like I'm typing fast with these switches. And I also

71
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:32,095
Speaker 5:  bought like an erox, I think it was one of the first

72
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:36,215
Speaker 5:  like ergonomical mechanical keyboards. And I got it. I was

73
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:39,535
Speaker 5:  super excited. I tried that out and hated it and I just put it in a box.

74
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:43,295
Speaker 5:  So when I got the RSI problems again, I'm like, oh, but I had the

75
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:47,335
Speaker 5:  solution here in a box somewhere. So I put it together and like, oh,

76
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:51,655
Speaker 5:  I theory crafted like, because it doesn't look like a regular keyboard,

77
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:55,215
Speaker 5:  right? So you have to figure out where to put your, at least your enter keys,

78
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:59,045
Speaker 5:  your space keys and some of these things. So I theory crafted them

79
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:02,965
Speaker 5:  like, oh, this will be perfect. It was so good. Put it together.

80
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:06,885
Speaker 5:  And I start typing like, oh shit, this sucks. I,

81
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:11,005
Speaker 5:  I mean I, I hate this. What? What should I do? Well of course

82
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,725
Speaker 5:  I bought another keyboard.

83
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:17,485
Speaker 2:  He eventually bought a keyboard called a Ferris. It looks kind of like a

84
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:21,285
Speaker 2:  normal keyboard deconstructed. It's made up of two panels of

85
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:25,005
Speaker 2:  17 keys, so 34 keys and all with a wire at the bottom

86
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:28,805
Speaker 2:  connecting the two parts. Each panel has five rows of keys aligned, kind

87
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,565
Speaker 2:  of like your hand with the tallest one in the middle, like your middle finger

88
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:36,005
Speaker 2:  and then two more keys, right where your thumb goes. The idea is that you

89
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:39,925
Speaker 2:  rest one hand on each panel and then you have easy access to all 34

90
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:43,565
Speaker 2:  keys without moving your fingers or wrists too much. So

91
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:45,845
Speaker 2:  Jonas buys that keyboard. Oh, and a mouse.

92
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:50,245
Speaker 5:  I also got this track ball because I got some RSI in the thumb

93
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:54,525
Speaker 5:  and most of these mouse alternatives you have the the ball of the

94
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:58,045
Speaker 5:  thumb, but that was really cotu. So I got this like big

95
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:02,085
Speaker 5:  track ball thing, which I move with the fingers. So of course I started that

96
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:02,845
Speaker 5:  route as well.

97
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:06,885
Speaker 2:  So he's got all this and feels like he's set. But the thing about Ferris

98
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:10,885
Speaker 2:  keyboards is that generally speaking, all the keys are blank. This thing

99
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:14,805
Speaker 2:  isn't a normal QWERTY keyboard like you're used to. And so you actually have

100
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:18,525
Speaker 2:  to decide where you want all the keys to go and oh boy,

101
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:22,805
Speaker 2:  is that quite the rabbit hole? It turns out there's nothing really magic

102
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:26,725
Speaker 2:  about the QWERTY layout that we're all used to. There are a lot of

103
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:30,685
Speaker 2:  theories about where Kie came from. Actually one you hear a lot

104
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:34,285
Speaker 2:  is that it was created for typewriters and that actually it deliberately

105
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:38,205
Speaker 2:  moved the commonly used keys away from each other so that the typewriter

106
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:41,765
Speaker 2:  mechanisms wouldn't crash into each other. I'm honestly not sure if that's

107
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:45,205
Speaker 2:  a myth or the truth, but that is kind of the common story that's out there

108
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,605
Speaker 2:  now. And really the reason we all use these keyboards

109
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:52,725
Speaker 2:  is just that we've used them all for so long. There's honestly not a better

110
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:56,285
Speaker 2:  reason that KTI has won except that it has won. And

111
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,365
Speaker 2:  retraining our brains to a new way of typing is just too much work.

112
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:03,285
Speaker 2:  But when you start thinking about it, when you really step all the way back

113
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:06,765
Speaker 2:  and start thinking about it, there are a lot of ways it could be better.

114
00:08:07,215 --> 00:08:10,725
Speaker 5:  Quirk is like one of the worst or if not the worst

115
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:15,005
Speaker 5:  keyboard layout that's actually used. I mean there are a lot of

116
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:18,965
Speaker 5:  different ways you can evaluate keyboard layout. Some, and almost

117
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:23,045
Speaker 5:  no matter what way you choose to evaluate corti is really,

118
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:26,885
Speaker 5:  really bad. I don't really care. If, you want to argue

119
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:30,805
Speaker 5:  that Mack is better than war or if it's better than workman,

120
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:34,045
Speaker 5:  but all of these are so much better than QWERTY.

121
00:08:34,455 --> 00:08:38,405
Speaker 2:  Isn't it weird that If you type quote unquote correctly, the only thing your

122
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:42,085
Speaker 2:  thumb ever does is hit the space bar. You're wasting two perfectly

123
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:45,885
Speaker 2:  good fingers on a single key, not to mention the easiest to hit

124
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:49,765
Speaker 2:  key on the whole keyboard. Also, your index finger is typically

125
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:53,605
Speaker 2:  more dextrous and powerful than your pinky. So why isn't it given

126
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:57,405
Speaker 2:  more to do and why are letters like O and A and even E,

127
00:08:57,465 --> 00:09:01,125
Speaker 2:  the most common letter right in the middle of the keyboard, I should say

128
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:04,885
Speaker 2:  by the way, that keyboards and keyboard needs vary widely

129
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:08,925
Speaker 2:  across languages. One reason a lot of non-English speaking countries

130
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:11,845
Speaker 2:  have gravitated to software keyboards in particular. And one of the reasons

131
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:15,405
Speaker 2:  phones have been so successful in those places is that they can be customized

132
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:19,285
Speaker 2:  and vary so much more. But for my purposes here, I only know how to type

133
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:22,965
Speaker 2:  in English, so I'm gonna focus on English keyboards. Jonas does type some

134
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:27,005
Speaker 2:  in Swedish too, but that didn't figure too much into his story. Talking

135
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:30,165
Speaker 2:  to Jonas got me wondering about keyboard layouts. I know about like

136
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:34,405
Speaker 2:  Dvorack, which rearranges all the letter keys to try and put the most common

137
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:37,405
Speaker 2:  letters in combinations right on the home row so that you don't have to move

138
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:41,085
Speaker 2:  your fingers as much. But there are actually a million others too. There's

139
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:44,725
Speaker 2:  Mack, which does the same thing as Voac, but rearranges them in a slightly

140
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:48,645
Speaker 2:  different way. There's workman which tries specifically to minimize how

141
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:51,805
Speaker 2:  much your fingers move side to side, which is one of the most painful things

142
00:09:51,805 --> 00:09:55,485
Speaker 2:  for them to do and how much work your pinkies have to do. There's one called

143
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:59,045
Speaker 2:  hands down that is particularly useful, If, you type in multiple languages

144
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:03,405
Speaker 2:  on and on and on. There are so many more of these than I realize. The one

145
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:07,405
Speaker 2:  I'm most interested in personally is called beak, L-B-E-A-K-L. It's

146
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:11,245
Speaker 2:  designed to do most of the same things as the rest, minimize finger and wrist

147
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,605
Speaker 2:  movement, especially side to side balance the load between your two hands,

148
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:18,605
Speaker 2:  make it easier to use the same finger for multiple letters in a row. But

149
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:22,565
Speaker 2:  bele is also big on shifting work from your ring and pinky finger

150
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,205
Speaker 2:  to your thumb. There's a website that I found with the principles of Bele

151
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:29,805
Speaker 2:  theory, which is a thing, and one of them is to exploit the

152
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:33,485
Speaker 2:  powerful thumbs to their maximum potential. What a cool sentence that is.

153
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:37,765
Speaker 2:  So you could put, let's say the E key, which again is the most commonly

154
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:41,645
Speaker 2:  used key on the keyboard on your thumb. It's wild and different, but

155
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:45,525
Speaker 2:  intellectually this makes sense to me. Anyway, Jonas tried Beagle and a bunch

156
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:49,165
Speaker 2:  of others and he started to lock in on something that felt really

157
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:53,205
Speaker 2:  good to type on, like physically good. And he also started to realize

158
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:57,125
Speaker 2:  that especially for his purposes, using a keyboard involved a whole

159
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:59,925
Speaker 2:  lot more than just typing the 26 letters of the alphabet.

160
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:03,605
Speaker 5:  When people talk about keyboard layouts, they almost

161
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:07,805
Speaker 5:  always refer to just the alpha keys like a, B, c,

162
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:11,485
Speaker 5:  up to set and it's like, oh, you have Mack. Well, they just

163
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:15,405
Speaker 5:  changed all these letters, but the numbers and the enter keys

164
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:19,365
Speaker 5:  and the space and everything else, they're always on the same, in the same

165
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:23,285
Speaker 5:  place. But when you use like a really small keyboard like

166
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:27,645
Speaker 5:  I do, then you don't even have this keys. So this is

167
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,485
Speaker 5:  something that you have to design

168
00:11:30,145 --> 00:11:33,565
Speaker 2:  For Jonas. There was one app in particular that he cared about most. This

169
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:36,965
Speaker 2:  is like the only thing he talked to me about in our whole conversation, VIM,

170
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:40,725
Speaker 2:  it's a 30-year-old outrageously customizable text editor.

171
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:44,885
Speaker 2:  It's one of those apps that people, particularly programmers, kind of live

172
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:46,445
Speaker 2:  their whole life inside of.

173
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:50,965
Speaker 5:  One of the things about whim is that you have all these strange key

174
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:55,005
Speaker 5:  bindings. You can almost talk to any Vim user about this.

175
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:58,645
Speaker 5:  What is their number one fear of switching to a new layout?

176
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:02,645
Speaker 5:  It's well will make Vim key bindings work.

177
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,365
Speaker 5:  And you have like this arrow keys like

178
00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:09,685
Speaker 5:  HJKL, and you have them on a regular keyboard. It's on the home

179
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:13,045
Speaker 5:  run. It's super convenient and most Veeam users

180
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:17,325
Speaker 5:  abuse them. People use them too much because, well, that's what

181
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:21,085
Speaker 5:  people do. So they also always worry, well, will this work?

182
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:25,285
Speaker 5:  I mean, should I, because switching to another layout, it's a

183
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:28,805
Speaker 5:  huge task. You need a ton of effort. Like nevermind just

184
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:32,685
Speaker 5:  designing your own, just learning something new is really, really

185
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,565
Speaker 5:  painful. And do you risk going into

186
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:40,165
Speaker 5:  this journey and you end up with something that might not

187
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:44,205
Speaker 5:  work for the tool that you use. And you know, myself and a lot of

188
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:48,085
Speaker 5:  other people who use wim, we use WIM for everything. I mean, we use

189
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:52,405
Speaker 5:  WIM all the time when we're programming, when we're writing. I mean there

190
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,925
Speaker 5:  are hours and hours every day we, we use this tool.

191
00:12:56,265 --> 00:13:00,205
Speaker 5:  So I mean, I would say that it's something that I was

192
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:03,645
Speaker 5:  worried about from the beginning. It was something I looked at

193
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:08,005
Speaker 5:  when looking at other keyboard layouts because you, you don't

194
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:11,845
Speaker 5:  want to have your most used key, like J is one of the least

195
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,685
Speaker 5:  used keys in English. So most keyboard layouts that

196
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:19,405
Speaker 5:  try to optimize for English, because most do that they will just put

197
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:23,485
Speaker 5:  J in the worst spot. But then as a Vem user that's like, oh,

198
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:26,725
Speaker 5:  that sucks. I can't lay out anymore.

199
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:31,285
Speaker 5:  Well it, it's not that bad. I mean a lot of people use something

200
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:35,085
Speaker 5:  like a navigation layer or they try to force themselves to reduce

201
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:39,045
Speaker 5:  the usage of yay and the others movement keys w

202
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:42,525
Speaker 5:  jump to in the next word for instance. And it's a lot better to use that

203
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:46,605
Speaker 5:  than the Veeam Arrow keys, but it was still something

204
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:48,045
Speaker 5:  that I was worried about.

205
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:52,605
Speaker 2:  So for an extremely specific, extremely customized use case,

206
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:56,805
Speaker 2:  Jonas decided to get an extremely specific, extremely customized keyboard.

207
00:13:57,155 --> 00:14:00,885
Speaker 2:  There's no world in which you or I could sit down and use his computer,

208
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,125
Speaker 2:  which is actually a thing about this whole process that I kind of love. We

209
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,965
Speaker 2:  all use the same gadgets in the same super prescribed ways

210
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:13,085
Speaker 2:  now. And Jonas just decided to blow all that up and set up

211
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,365
Speaker 2:  something that worked just for him and nobody else.

212
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:19,725
Speaker 5:  The this was just for me to reduce my RSI.

213
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,965
Speaker 5:  And I mean, should I do this because of popularity or or

214
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:27,725
Speaker 5:  because I want everyone else to use it. No, I don't. I just

215
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:31,685
Speaker 5:  want it to feel good for me. And it's the same reason why I

216
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:34,925
Speaker 5:  spent hours of configuring my own Neo VE

217
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:38,485
Speaker 5:  configuration. I mean that that's just time sink that will,

218
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:42,925
Speaker 5:  no one will ever get any use of it. It's just for me. And

219
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:46,965
Speaker 5:  it's the same for my layout really. And

220
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:50,605
Speaker 5:  I know there are a lot of people who designed these like general

221
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:55,405
Speaker 5:  layouts, but I really feel that customizing the layout,

222
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:59,565
Speaker 5:  even If, you just, you know, change escape to a better

223
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,925
Speaker 5:  position because as a wind user escape is like a super important key. So

224
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:07,685
Speaker 5:  maybe you just change that. And I think customizing things

225
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,725
Speaker 5:  is actually a bit underappreciated in the keyboard

226
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:16,045
Speaker 5:  layout community. I mean, a lot of people want to make

227
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:19,885
Speaker 5:  these generalized good things like, oh, this is the perfect layout

228
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:23,765
Speaker 5:  for English. And I think more people should try to

229
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:27,525
Speaker 5:  customize, especially when you go down this rabbit hole of choosing

230
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,925
Speaker 5:  a smaller keyboard or a more iCal keyboard.

231
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:35,525
Speaker 2:  So Jonas starts experimenting at this point. He puts in a layout, uses it

232
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:39,285
Speaker 2:  for a while and starts trying to really notice what's working and what

233
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:42,765
Speaker 2:  isn't. I both do and don't recommend doing this for yourself by the way,

234
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:46,365
Speaker 2:  because it'll make you strangely self-aware of how you type.

235
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,645
Speaker 2:  And at least for me, I'm convinced it's making me worse at typing. I think

236
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:53,245
Speaker 2:  about it much more than I ever have and I'm not sure that's a good thing.

237
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:57,325
Speaker 2:  But Jonas got really good at figurine out what worked and what didn't.

238
00:15:57,545 --> 00:16:00,125
Speaker 2:  And most importantly, what hurt and what didn't.

239
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:04,645
Speaker 5:  I think there are two directions you can do this. One is

240
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:08,565
Speaker 5:  to take the purely algorithmically approach. You create

241
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:12,405
Speaker 5:  a computer program that optimizes to find the perfect layout for you and

242
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:16,165
Speaker 5:  then you just tweak the settings. Oh, I don't like same finger

243
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:19,925
Speaker 5:  diagrams. So this is a penalty for having these two keys

244
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:23,965
Speaker 5:  on the same finger. And then you just tweak all these

245
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:27,765
Speaker 5:  settings all the time until you find something that's good. So that that's

246
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:31,405
Speaker 5:  one way of doing it. I did not do that. I instead

247
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:34,885
Speaker 5:  went mostly on feel. So when

248
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:38,885
Speaker 5:  designing the alpha layer, I looked a lot at the same finger

249
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:42,645
Speaker 5:  diagram because I know that it was something I really

250
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:46,685
Speaker 5:  disliked. So oh, maybe I can switch around these three

251
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:50,685
Speaker 5:  characters. And I thought about it like a lot, oh, I'm gonna try it. And

252
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:54,605
Speaker 5:  I look in this like analyzers, oh, but that

253
00:16:54,605 --> 00:16:58,525
Speaker 5:  diagram is really common. That's not good. So then I went back to

254
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:02,365
Speaker 5:  the drawing book, but mostly it was think about it,

255
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:05,805
Speaker 5:  think about it some more, try it. That was

256
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:09,645
Speaker 5:  basically my approach. It's probably not the best approach,

257
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:13,765
Speaker 5:  but it was the one I used mostly because I think

258
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:17,805
Speaker 5:  it's extremely hard for me to put down this

259
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:21,645
Speaker 5:  feeling of how good this feel into numbers.

260
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:26,085
Speaker 5:  You can do a basic exercise to just, how hard is it to press

261
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:30,445
Speaker 5:  one key on your keyboard? So if it's on the home round, you can

262
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:34,445
Speaker 5:  put a zero because it's the easiest, but in the edge of the screen of

263
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:38,205
Speaker 5:  the keyboard, is that the four or is that the three or

264
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:41,805
Speaker 5:  maybe a five? I tried to do this exercise and every time

265
00:17:42,085 --> 00:17:45,805
Speaker 5:  I went back to do it again I got a different result because

266
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:50,125
Speaker 5:  it's so freaking hard for me to just put these things into

267
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:54,005
Speaker 5:  numbers. So that's why I gave up on the idea and I just said, oh,

268
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:57,885
Speaker 5:  I will just try it, feel it and change it whenever I

269
00:17:58,155 --> 00:17:59,005
Speaker 5:  dislike something.

270
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:03,325
Speaker 2:  Did you ever try something and then just immediately the first

271
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:06,405
Speaker 2:  time you hit the key you were like, I hate this, this feels bad. Failed attempt.

272
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:10,885
Speaker 5:  Yes, I think I had R and underscore like they're

273
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:14,725
Speaker 5:  not on the same finger now, but I, I tried it and it's,

274
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:18,045
Speaker 5:  oh, I can just switch these two keys. It would be much better.

275
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:22,565
Speaker 5:  And the first time I, I used type something because in coding you have like

276
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:26,645
Speaker 5:  r and underscore quite often next to each other when you type

277
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:30,965
Speaker 5:  variable names with snake case, I was like, oh I hate this. And I

278
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:32,565
Speaker 5:  immediately just threw it away.

279
00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:36,765
Speaker 2:  Once you start to think about this stuff in terms of minimizing pain and

280
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:40,885
Speaker 2:  movement, you come across all sorts of hacks. One thing I had never heard

281
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:44,645
Speaker 2:  of but Jonas and others talk about a lot is the idea of a repeat

282
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:44,925
Speaker 2:  key.

283
00:18:45,445 --> 00:18:49,325
Speaker 5:  I don't remember exactly where I got this idea from, but the repeat key

284
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:53,245
Speaker 5:  basically repeats the last key you pressed. So for instance,

285
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,845
Speaker 5:  If, you want to type fool, you press

286
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,365
Speaker 5:  FOOL, but in this case you press

287
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:03,365
Speaker 5:  FO, repeat L, why is this useful? Well,

288
00:19:03,905 --> 00:19:07,725
Speaker 5:  If, you are just looking at same finger programs, which I don't

289
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:11,685
Speaker 5:  like. I dislike pressing the same key multiple times.

290
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:16,085
Speaker 5:  So instead of typing O with the middle finger, I type

291
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:19,405
Speaker 5:  middle finger and then the pink, which is my repeat key

292
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:23,365
Speaker 5:  location right now. So you can do this like rolling motion

293
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:27,605
Speaker 5:  and rolling motions, they're really quite nice and

294
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:31,645
Speaker 5:  a lot of different keyboard layouts optimize more for rolling

295
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,565
Speaker 5:  motions than same finger diagrams. So I think

296
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:39,405
Speaker 5:  empty gap is one layout which has really good rolls.

297
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:43,205
Speaker 2:  Rolling meaning kind of just the way your fingers move from

298
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:44,085
Speaker 2:  into out,

299
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:47,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah, into out or out win. If they're not next to each other,

300
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,045
Speaker 5:  they're usually really easy to press.

301
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:54,205
Speaker 2:  This is what I mean when I say it's a deep rabbit hole. The people who work

302
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:57,005
Speaker 2:  on this stuff are thinking about keyboards the way I think we all should

303
00:19:57,665 --> 00:20:01,605
Speaker 2:  as incredibly important, incredibly complex tools that get used

304
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:05,365
Speaker 2:  for countless hours every day and in which even a small improvement

305
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:08,965
Speaker 2:  can be a huge deal. And there are so many small improvements out there.

306
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:12,485
Speaker 2:  One thing a lot of keyboard tinkerers like to use is what's called a one

307
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:16,245
Speaker 2:  shot key. Instead of pressing and holding. So If, you wanna capitalize something,

308
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:20,045
Speaker 2:  you hit shift and then the letter you want, instead of having to hold, shift

309
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:23,285
Speaker 2:  down and stretch your hand all the way across the keyboard, it's a little

310
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:27,245
Speaker 2:  thing but can be a real pain reliever. The problem is all that

311
00:20:27,245 --> 00:20:31,125
Speaker 2:  improvement is fighting against literally a hundred years of muscle memory

312
00:20:31,305 --> 00:20:35,245
Speaker 2:  in how to use QWERTY keyboards. And so the improvements keep losing.

313
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,285
Speaker 2:  It took Jonas someone who was deeply dedicated to this two years

314
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,965
Speaker 2:  to get around to something that fit, that he didn't feel like he needed to

315
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:46,805
Speaker 2:  obsessively tweak anymore. I tried a bunch of times to get him

316
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:50,525
Speaker 2:  to describe kind of his mental model of his keyboard, how he

317
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:54,205
Speaker 2:  designed it, how it works, and how he uses it. And he kind of couldn't do

318
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:54,325
Speaker 2:  it.

319
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,885
Speaker 5:  I was worried you, I would have to explain, oh, where is X? Oh, where

320
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:02,325
Speaker 5:  is this? Because I can't, it's almost all muscle

321
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:06,365
Speaker 5:  memory right now. I mean if I really think about it, sure

322
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:10,005
Speaker 5:  the most used keys I could probably map out. But I mean

323
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:14,165
Speaker 5:  most of it is just I need to sit down and press the buttons

324
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:18,365
Speaker 2:  Since he can't explain it. Let me try Jonas's layout, which he now calls

325
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:22,045
Speaker 2:  T 34 is basically a bunch of layers of keys.

326
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:26,285
Speaker 2:  The top layer is the alphabet and some basic punctuation. And he put

327
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,845
Speaker 2:  common letters like T and K and I in the center and e

328
00:21:30,065 --> 00:21:33,885
Speaker 2:  on his thumb. He has two modifier keys that then let him go down

329
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:37,485
Speaker 2:  a layer to a new set of keys. This part he does explain pretty well.

330
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:41,885
Speaker 5:  So for instance, you can have, oh, where do you have your arrow keys? Well,

331
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:46,125
Speaker 5:  I just press down my left thumb and then I have arrow keys on the

332
00:21:46,215 --> 00:21:50,125
Speaker 5:  right hand just below my fingers. I also have it on the left hand,

333
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:53,925
Speaker 5:  like in the arrow configuration that normal keywords have as well.

334
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:58,005
Speaker 5:  So when I press the thumb, I activate the navigation layer.

335
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:01,845
Speaker 5:  And then you have this like, like, like you say, you, you stack the

336
00:22:01,995 --> 00:22:05,885
Speaker 5:  keys on top of them. So that's a way you can access arrow

337
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:09,885
Speaker 5:  keys, function keys. I also access number keys because I don't

338
00:22:09,885 --> 00:22:13,805
Speaker 5:  have a number or symbols, et cetera. So yeah, I don't know

339
00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:17,645
Speaker 5:  how many layers I have. It ends up quite a lot. I have a lot of

340
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:21,605
Speaker 5:  layers that don't even remember, like I had this idea of

341
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:25,565
Speaker 5:  wanting to be able to type regular shortcuts because

342
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:29,565
Speaker 5:  like control X is a super common shortcut

343
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:33,485
Speaker 5:  in a lot of different applications, but I have X

344
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:37,045
Speaker 5:  on the right hand, so sometimes I just want to use

345
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:41,325
Speaker 5:  the mouse with my right hand. So I don't want to remove my mouse

346
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:45,045
Speaker 5:  and do control X. So I have a layer. Well,

347
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:48,605
Speaker 5:  control X is on the left side, so layers is a super

348
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:49,605
Speaker 5:  important thing.

349
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,965
Speaker 2:  This all feels to me a little like trying to use Excel just with a keyboard,

350
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:57,845
Speaker 2:  remembering all of the navigation tools and keyboard shortcuts and formulas

351
00:22:57,845 --> 00:23:01,485
Speaker 2:  and everything else. But Jonas says that once he figured it out, it began

352
00:23:01,485 --> 00:23:05,445
Speaker 2:  to feel much better, at least for him. I should again be clear here

353
00:23:05,445 --> 00:23:09,205
Speaker 2:  that never for one second, did he think he was designing a better keyboard

354
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:13,285
Speaker 2:  for everybody, just a better keyboard for himself. And honestly, in this

355
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:16,165
Speaker 2:  case, even better, depends on how you define the word.

356
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:20,565
Speaker 5:  I thought I would really enjoy this process of gradually getting

357
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,805
Speaker 5:  better. Like, because I had this idea in my head.

358
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:27,965
Speaker 5:  Another cool thing is to be a really fast typer. So I want

359
00:23:27,985 --> 00:23:31,805
Speaker 5:  to, you know, continue with practicing every day until I, I

360
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:35,765
Speaker 5:  beat my old score and maybe even surpass it. But then I just figured,

361
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:39,405
Speaker 5:  ah, this is just super hard work, it's really

362
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:43,405
Speaker 5:  boring and I cannot do it anymore. So I'm not

363
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:47,125
Speaker 5:  even close as fast as I'm on a regular keyboard,

364
00:23:47,525 --> 00:23:51,325
Speaker 5:  I don't really care that much that I'm a bit slower. I mean I

365
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:54,285
Speaker 5:  really care about my hand not hurting every day.

366
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:59,045
Speaker 2:  So victory, right? As for whether it was worth all the time and energy to

367
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:01,565
Speaker 2:  get to this point, well debatable,

368
00:24:02,245 --> 00:24:06,165
Speaker 5:  I actually started its journey when we had our second child, our

369
00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:10,045
Speaker 5:  middle child, and he was awake like one to two hours

370
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:14,085
Speaker 5:  every night. He's on my chest in some kind of strap and I just standing

371
00:24:14,545 --> 00:24:18,365
Speaker 5:  and I don't want to play with him because I want him to sleep. So I, I ended

372
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:21,845
Speaker 5:  up just standing in front of my computer and doing stuff and

373
00:24:22,065 --> 00:24:26,045
Speaker 5:  that's when I really designed most of my layout and learned most

374
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:29,525
Speaker 5:  of my layout. So in the middle of night, like for six months or something,

375
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:33,685
Speaker 5:  I was just like a bit sleep deprived and maybe that's what

376
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:36,645
Speaker 5:  it takes to go on on this kind of journey. But I don't know.

377
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:41,285
Speaker 2:  All that said though, he does kind of think everyone should go

378
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:45,125
Speaker 2:  through at least a bit of this process. And I think I agree If, you spend

379
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:48,925
Speaker 2:  hours a day with your wrists cocked awkwardly and stretching painfully

380
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:52,845
Speaker 2:  around a keyboard. Why shouldn't you invest the time and energy to get

381
00:24:52,845 --> 00:24:53,285
Speaker 2:  something better?

382
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:57,765
Speaker 5:  The first thing I would recommend is just to get the programmable

383
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:01,885
Speaker 5:  keyboard If. you use Wim, you know that escape is the best

384
00:25:02,225 --> 00:25:06,205
Speaker 5:  key there is and there are lots of different ways to, to solve this.

385
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:10,125
Speaker 5:  But you If, you have a programmable keyboard, you can just move it to caps

386
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:14,005
Speaker 5:  lock or you can make a combo on the home row. Or maybe you

387
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:17,845
Speaker 5:  use emax and you say that, oh the control key is

388
00:25:17,845 --> 00:25:21,645
Speaker 5:  the most horrible key there is because you need like a

389
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:25,445
Speaker 5:  a six finger If. you use emax, you really should have a six finger. So you

390
00:25:25,445 --> 00:25:29,205
Speaker 5:  can press that damn control key all the time. If, you have a

391
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:33,125
Speaker 5:  programmable keyboard, then you can just move control up to caps lock. You

392
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:37,085
Speaker 5:  can even have escape and caps lock on the same key. So

393
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:41,005
Speaker 5:  If, you tap it, it's escape and If, you hold it down, it's control. So that's

394
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:44,885
Speaker 5:  really the first thing I would recommend people to do because you don't have

395
00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:48,565
Speaker 5:  to relearn anything. You can just remap escape or

396
00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:52,205
Speaker 5:  control or you can put the navigation layers. Like instead of having the

397
00:25:52,255 --> 00:25:56,205
Speaker 5:  arrow keys like far away on the keyboard, you can just have it on

398
00:25:56,205 --> 00:26:00,005
Speaker 5:  the home row and just hold down something. And that's pretty easy to get

399
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:00,285
Speaker 5:  right.

400
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:04,385
Speaker 2:  He also recommended a split keyboard, which makes total sense to me, but

401
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:08,105
Speaker 2:  I should confess something here. I hung up our call expecting to go make

402
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:11,905
Speaker 2:  a bunch of changes, explore a new layout, try and combat the pain that I'm

403
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:15,785
Speaker 2:  also starting to feel typing all day every day. And then I did nothing,

404
00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:20,145
Speaker 2:  just nothing. The thing is I type too much too often

405
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,945
Speaker 2:  and I type really fast and it just seems like so much work to

406
00:26:23,945 --> 00:26:27,785
Speaker 2:  essentially learn what amounts to like a new instrument just to be able to

407
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:31,225
Speaker 2:  do my job all day. I'm not sure how long I could get away with

408
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:35,025
Speaker 2:  not filing stories because I can't type fast enough, you know what I mean?

409
00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:39,385
Speaker 2:  So I'm stuck sitting here staring at this stupid QWERTY keyboard on

410
00:26:39,385 --> 00:26:43,025
Speaker 2:  my desk, which apparently everyone agrees is a bad option, but it's kind

411
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:46,805
Speaker 2:  kind of just the one we're stuck with. And so now I'm looking around my desk

412
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:50,645
Speaker 2:  wondering what else is like this? What other tech is this way? Just because

413
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:54,725
Speaker 2:  it is this way. We talk about AI as upending the way we

414
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:58,645
Speaker 2:  do everything online. And maybe that's good even if the AI isn't good and

415
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:02,485
Speaker 2:  ultimately isn't going to change everything about how we do everything because

416
00:27:02,485 --> 00:27:06,405
Speaker 2:  maybe it's good to sit down and rethink how we do everything every

417
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:07,005
Speaker 2:  once in a while.

418
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:11,525
Speaker 5:  My image of the ultimate keyboard was just a regular keyboard

419
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:15,805
Speaker 5:  with cooler switches. So that, that was the extent of my knowledge. I,

420
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:19,405
Speaker 5:  I knew I had this adox, but it's like that's just a weird strange

421
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:23,445
Speaker 5:  thing. But I mean I think it's when you start

422
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:27,365
Speaker 5:  going down the rabbit hole, the hole starts to open and you realize,

423
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,445
Speaker 5:  oh there are so many other things.

424
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:34,605
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and talk

425
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:38,165
Speaker 2:  about Surface Windows and The future of Microsoft. We'll be right back.

426
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:43,495
Speaker 7:  Support for The Vergecast

427
00:28:30,535 --> 00:28:30,775
Speaker 7:  client

428
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:23,705
Speaker 6:  fun, but it's the experiences that people love the most about traveling.

429
00:29:23,855 --> 00:29:27,065
Speaker 6:  When you get back home, that T-shirt might fade and that snow globe

430
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:44,245
Speaker 2:  might just hire the entirety of OpenAI. And of course all of that

431
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:48,045
Speaker 2:  turned out to be nothing. But there have been a few corporate

432
00:30:48,135 --> 00:30:52,085
Speaker 2:  moves and a couple of product launches and even a different non acquisition

433
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:55,885
Speaker 2:  acquisition That all make me think there is something big

434
00:30:55,935 --> 00:30:59,845
Speaker 2:  going on here in terms of how Microsoft thinks about AI and

435
00:30:59,845 --> 00:31:03,725
Speaker 2:  Windows and Surface in particular. So it's time to do what we

436
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:06,765
Speaker 2:  always do in these situations, which is get the verges Tom Warren on the

437
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:10,485
Speaker 2:  line to help us figure out what's actually going on here. Tom Warren, welcome

438
00:31:10,485 --> 00:31:11,005
Speaker 2:  back to the show.

439
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:12,325
Speaker 8:  Hey, good to be back.

440
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:15,805
Speaker 2:  I feel like I have to bring you on every time Microsoft does something weird

441
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:18,605
Speaker 2:  and confusing and you have to make sense of it. I feel like this is, this

442
00:31:18,605 --> 00:31:21,645
Speaker 2:  is not what your job should be, but this is what, this is what I need you

443
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:21,805
Speaker 2:  for.

444
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:25,605
Speaker 8:  It does feel like that's my job. It's just explaining Microsoft's mess

445
00:31:25,965 --> 00:31:26,525
Speaker 8:  essentially

446
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:30,325
Speaker 2:  Just forever like reading the org chart of Microsoft to make sense.

447
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:33,605
Speaker 2:  And so actually the org chart is where I wanna start. I wanna talk about

448
00:31:33,745 --> 00:31:36,165
Speaker 2:  AI PCs and I wanna talk about services, but we're gonna get to all that in

449
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:39,885
Speaker 2:  a minute 'cause I actually think what is happening inside of Microsoft actually

450
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:43,125
Speaker 2:  explains a lot of that stuff. Right? So let's go back to

451
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:47,525
Speaker 2:  six-ish months ago I think, which is when Pantos Pane announced he was leaving

452
00:31:48,085 --> 00:31:51,885
Speaker 2:  Microsoft. Yes. Describe that moment to me at Microsoft. 'cause he's the

453
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:54,565
Speaker 2:  guy who'd been there forever. He was a big face of Microsoft, he was in charge

454
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:58,045
Speaker 2:  of a lot of things. Like what happened when PAOs left.

455
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:01,325
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think it was, it was kind of a surprise, right? I think it took us

456
00:32:01,345 --> 00:32:04,525
Speaker 8:  up by surprise and I think it probably took Microsoft by surprise as well.

457
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:08,245
Speaker 8:  Like the thing is it was a few days or like before a surfers event,

458
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:11,605
Speaker 8:  which was also like, oh that's right timing. you know, that they announced

459
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:15,445
Speaker 8:  it publicly anyway. And I think like catching up with people at the event

460
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:19,125
Speaker 8:  you could, you got that sense that it was a surprise, you know, this wasn't

461
00:32:19,525 --> 00:32:22,645
Speaker 8:  expected to happen. So yeah, I think that that, that was the big takeaway

462
00:32:22,645 --> 00:32:26,005
Speaker 8:  was it was a surprise. And I think the way that Microsoft kind of responded

463
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:29,965
Speaker 8:  to it, like Mandela's shapeshifting of Windows was that they

464
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:33,365
Speaker 8:  split Windows and Surface so, so panel's responsibilities

465
00:32:34,115 --> 00:32:35,285
Speaker 8:  into two different leaders.

466
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,645
Speaker 2:  And if I'm not mistaken, Microsoft had made a big deal out of uniting those

467
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:43,365
Speaker 2:  things under Panos, right? Yeah. That was like, that was supposed to be this

468
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:47,765
Speaker 2:  coherent like holistic way of thinking about devices. Right? And that wasn't

469
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:48,045
Speaker 2:  that long

470
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:52,005
Speaker 8:  Ago. No, it wasn't and it, it, it was around, actually I think it was

471
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:53,565
Speaker 8:  just before the pandemic started.

472
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:56,245
Speaker 2:  Oh wow, okay. Which I guess at this point is a while ago, but

473
00:32:56,665 --> 00:32:59,045
Speaker 8:  It doesn't seem like that long ago. It was a while ago. It doesn't feel like

474
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:02,605
Speaker 8:  it. Right, okay. But it was interesting timing because it was a few months

475
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:06,565
Speaker 8:  after Panos and, and the rest of the Surface team had unveiled the, you know,

476
00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:10,085
Speaker 8:  dual screen Surface stuff and that was gonna be The future of Windows and

477
00:33:10,085 --> 00:33:13,565
Speaker 8:  all that sort of stuff. So it, it seemed like that, you know, putting

478
00:33:13,565 --> 00:33:17,245
Speaker 8:  everything under Panos was going to align

479
00:33:17,315 --> 00:33:20,885
Speaker 8:  Surface hardware and Windows software. So that seemed like that was what

480
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:23,645
Speaker 8:  was gonna happen. That's what Panos had been working on and then they just

481
00:33:23,645 --> 00:33:27,045
Speaker 8:  split it out in a really weird way. So obviously Panos left

482
00:33:27,545 --> 00:33:31,445
Speaker 8:  for Amazon, they gave the Surface hardware stuff to Pav Van

483
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:35,285
Speaker 8:  Dava Luri, he's been at Microsoft for over 20 years. He's pretty

484
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:39,445
Speaker 8:  key Surface engineer, he's definitely a key player there. It

485
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:43,085
Speaker 8:  was pretty instrumental to the Qualcomm and a MD relationships

486
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:47,165
Speaker 8:  where they've done the customs SQ one processes and stuff for these Surface.

487
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:50,525
Speaker 2:  So like a natural guy to put in charge of this after partner seats. Okay.

488
00:33:50,525 --> 00:33:53,765
Speaker 8:  Yeah, definitely for the hardware side. And then they split off the Windows

489
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:57,445
Speaker 8:  sort of engineering efforts and all those teams over to, to Macal

490
00:33:57,985 --> 00:34:01,325
Speaker 8:  Perkin who had been at Microsoft for, for a number of years as well. But

491
00:34:01,465 --> 00:34:05,245
Speaker 8:  was essentially his official title was formally now, but

492
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:08,365
Speaker 8:  CEO of like web and advertising.

493
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:12,085
Speaker 2:  I feel like he's a name I started to hear with some of the AI stuff over

494
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:13,005
Speaker 2:  the last year. So is that

495
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:16,525
Speaker 8:  Right? Yeah, so he was looking after, you'd hear him a lot when he was tweeting

496
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:18,765
Speaker 8:  for about the Bing Chat stuff. Oh

497
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah, okay.

498
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:23,405
Speaker 8:  Edge maybe all that sort of stuff. So it was difficult for me to wrap my

499
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:26,765
Speaker 8:  head around this 'cause it was like, it didn't seem like the natural person's

500
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:30,405
Speaker 8:  takeover windows just given his role, but he's obviously

501
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:34,565
Speaker 8:  a talented engineer and and leader, but it seems strange

502
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:38,805
Speaker 8:  for it to go that way given where Windows Windows and Surface have been.

503
00:34:39,305 --> 00:34:43,205
Speaker 8:  So that happened about six months ago. He's been looking after that and

504
00:34:43,205 --> 00:34:44,605
Speaker 8:  then not so much anymore.

505
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:48,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So that, that brings us to, to now and basically that has been

506
00:34:49,065 --> 00:34:52,325
Speaker 2:  at least as far as I can tell, sort of pretty cleanly undone

507
00:34:52,385 --> 00:34:55,925
Speaker 8:  Pretty much. Yeah. So the teams that, I'd say most of the teams

508
00:34:56,235 --> 00:35:00,165
Speaker 8:  that went over to AL'S organization have gone

509
00:35:00,195 --> 00:35:04,085
Speaker 8:  back essentially If, you wanna call it that to per van

510
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:07,965
Speaker 8:  d who was obviously looking after the Surface hardware. So he's now looking

511
00:35:07,965 --> 00:35:11,765
Speaker 8:  after Windows, most of the Windows engineering and Surface hardware.

512
00:35:12,465 --> 00:35:15,965
Speaker 8:  The key thing is that it all kind of ties into a big move

513
00:35:16,235 --> 00:35:19,605
Speaker 8:  that Nadella made. So this is why it's, it's actually happening.

514
00:35:20,265 --> 00:35:23,765
Speaker 8:  And he's obviously hired the former co-founder of Google

515
00:35:23,845 --> 00:35:27,765
Speaker 8:  DeepMind, Mustafa Solomon, and he hired him into a position

516
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:31,725
Speaker 8:  as CEO of Microsoft ai. So a new group inside Microsoft

517
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:35,685
Speaker 8:  or you might say the same group that Macal was looking after and

518
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:39,605
Speaker 8:  has kind of been pushed out slightly. He's given it a lot to

519
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:43,605
Speaker 8:  Microsoft and particularly on the ads and search side.

520
00:35:43,605 --> 00:35:46,685
Speaker 8:  Like they, they've become a lot more relevant in the last few years on, on

521
00:35:46,685 --> 00:35:50,005
Speaker 8:  that side than they, than they've been before. You can argue they've been

522
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:53,285
Speaker 8:  pushing Bing in weird ways, pushing edge in weird ways that haven't been

523
00:35:53,305 --> 00:35:55,005
Speaker 8:  too great for consumers.

524
00:35:55,105 --> 00:35:58,605
Speaker 2:  You're saying you don't love giant popups telling you to use Bing Chat?

525
00:35:58,845 --> 00:36:02,365
Speaker 8:  I love it when I'm in the middle of playing a game or like in my Excel spreadsheet

526
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:06,165
Speaker 8:  and there's this giant, please use copilot or whatever. Yeah,

527
00:36:06,395 --> 00:36:06,885
Speaker 8:  perfect.

528
00:36:07,155 --> 00:36:10,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's the clippies thing Microsoft has done since Clippy and I'm, I'm

529
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:14,525
Speaker 2:  not a fan. I know, but okay, so if I, if I understand sort of the org structure

530
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:18,685
Speaker 2:  now you have basically the sort of windows and

531
00:36:19,235 --> 00:36:22,765
Speaker 2:  devices side of things, which is basically like hardware that people

532
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:26,925
Speaker 2:  use and that's all under Pavan Velu now he has like

533
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:29,205
Speaker 2:  most of the Panos job is now his.

534
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:32,845
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And he's not like, he's still not on like the senior leadership team,

535
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:36,205
Speaker 8:  so he still reports up to someone, but essentially he, that's what he's looking

536
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:40,165
Speaker 8:  after and I think I get the impression that most of that work that he's

537
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:44,165
Speaker 8:  be looking after is, is how they optimize windows

538
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:47,885
Speaker 8:  for the new silicon that's coming and you know, the NPUs,

539
00:36:48,345 --> 00:36:51,765
Speaker 8:  all that sort of stuff. 'cause that seems to be pretty key and we'll see

540
00:36:51,765 --> 00:36:55,565
Speaker 8:  talk about that soon. But that's why they, I think they're bringing it back

541
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:58,565
Speaker 8:  to, to that side 'cause they know they need that engineering effort.

542
00:36:58,985 --> 00:37:02,045
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. I do wanna talk about that Yeah, in just a sec because I think

543
00:37:02,225 --> 00:37:05,685
Speaker 2:  how all of this comes like back together in the product is the part of this

544
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:09,205
Speaker 2:  that I understand the least and right. We're gonna talk about that. But

545
00:37:09,505 --> 00:37:13,245
Speaker 2:  the, the other side of this, we haven't really talked about all of the inflection

546
00:37:13,825 --> 00:37:14,045
Speaker 2:  AI

547
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:14,725
Speaker 8:  Yes.

548
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:19,485
Speaker 2:  Non acquisition acquisition stuff going on. So basically as I understand

549
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:23,445
Speaker 2:  it, Microsoft hired Mufa Suleman who was the co-founder of DeepMind and then

550
00:37:23,445 --> 00:37:26,445
Speaker 2:  went and founded this company called Inflection ai. Yep. Paid a ton of money

551
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:30,165
Speaker 2:  for him and a bunch of other executives to come join the company. Didn't

552
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,765
Speaker 2:  call it an acquisition. A lot of people are saying that's because it was

553
00:37:32,765 --> 00:37:36,205
Speaker 2:  worried about the antitrust ramifications of calling it an acquisition. But

554
00:37:36,205 --> 00:37:39,805
Speaker 2:  essentially they acquihire or like whatever the opposite of an acquihire

555
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:43,605
Speaker 2:  is like higher positioned a bunch of inflection AI people to

556
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:47,525
Speaker 2:  come do AI for Microsoft. Which again to me says

557
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:52,165
Speaker 2:  Microsoft doesn't feel like it is where it needs to be

558
00:37:52,425 --> 00:37:56,325
Speaker 2:  in terms of like winning the AI race. And this is the company that 12 months

559
00:37:56,345 --> 00:38:00,245
Speaker 2:  ago was just as confident as you could possibly be about The future

560
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:03,765
Speaker 2:  of AI and Bing being the thing and making Google dance and that they were

561
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:07,285
Speaker 2:  really gonna win. This says to me that Microsoft is much less

562
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:11,325
Speaker 2:  feeling itself maybe than it was a year ago. What's your read of this

563
00:38:11,605 --> 00:38:11,805
Speaker 2:  situation?

564
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:16,005
Speaker 8:  I think that's, that's spot on. Yeah, so they, a year ago obviously, and

565
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:18,565
Speaker 8:  I've written about this recently, they, they were obviously all in on Bing

566
00:38:18,565 --> 00:38:22,285
Speaker 8:  and Bing chat, all that sort of stuff. And internally they were talking

567
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:26,165
Speaker 8:  about picking the Bing brand because obviously there's I think

568
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:30,005
Speaker 8:  particularly among tech people anyway and, and the, the general consumer

569
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:32,325
Speaker 8:  can look at Bing and probably be like, don't even know what it is maybe.

570
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:36,365
Speaker 8:  But along the, along the tech sort of people is is kind of

571
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:39,485
Speaker 8:  laughed at, right? It's it's frowned upon the the Bing brand. Yeah. And they

572
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:42,765
Speaker 8:  were talking internally at that time like, you know, it's it's it's 500 million

573
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:45,885
Speaker 8:  or whatever it's in marketing spend to pick a new name. So they were like,

574
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:49,285
Speaker 8:  we're gonna go with Bing. That's the way forward. It didn't really shift

575
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,725
Speaker 8:  the needle, right? Like Nadela wanted Google to dance. They, they wanted

576
00:38:52,865 --> 00:38:56,645
Speaker 8:  to get all these, you know, percentage points off of Google. I don't, I think

577
00:38:56,645 --> 00:39:00,405
Speaker 8:  they probably only got about one or 2% if that otherwise they were,

578
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:03,845
Speaker 8:  they were aiming for for more for there to be an impact. you know,

579
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:07,805
Speaker 2:  My impression is that most people who use Bing through Microsoft

580
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:11,925
Speaker 2:  think they're using chat GPT. Yes. I can't prove that but like when I talk

581
00:39:12,205 --> 00:39:16,085
Speaker 2:  to people who are using Bing as AI stuff, they think they're using chat

582
00:39:16,205 --> 00:39:18,525
Speaker 2:  GPT, which is a bad sign for Microsoft.

583
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:22,165
Speaker 8:  Yeah, that's probably reasonable. And they obviously rebranded the Bing chat

584
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:25,485
Speaker 8:  stuff to, to copilot, right. And they've done this Super Bowl ad, all that

585
00:39:25,485 --> 00:39:29,245
Speaker 8:  sort of stuff. So that's, that's all linked in with this and like when I've

586
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:33,085
Speaker 8:  been speaking to people about working under Macal, it

587
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:36,845
Speaker 8:  sounds like it was run as, as kind of like a startup atmosphere there

588
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:40,565
Speaker 8:  where you're, you're constantly work, like you're trying to do as much out

589
00:39:40,565 --> 00:39:44,525
Speaker 8:  of as little resources as you have. So it seems like it was kind of

590
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:48,405
Speaker 8:  a bit crunchy over there and I think there was some micromanaging

591
00:39:48,405 --> 00:39:51,645
Speaker 8:  going on there as well. There's some, some of that sort of stuff that that's

592
00:39:51,645 --> 00:39:55,285
Speaker 8:  been happening, which to fair is probably happens in a bunch of

593
00:39:55,285 --> 00:39:59,125
Speaker 8:  organizations anyway. But it seemed like it just, I think from the fact that

594
00:39:59,265 --> 00:40:03,165
Speaker 8:  Nadela has gone and hired someone into the CEO position,

595
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:05,885
Speaker 8:  it clearly wasn't working right. Like wherever they were doing in that team

596
00:40:05,885 --> 00:40:09,485
Speaker 8:  wasn't working. And that's the key point that I think

597
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:13,045
Speaker 8:  Bloomberg reported that Nadella was frustrated at that team or

598
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,245
Speaker 8:  frustrated that the timeline's there or something. 'cause he obviously wants

599
00:40:16,245 --> 00:40:19,845
Speaker 8:  to go fast and Microsoft has been going very fast on co-pilot in office

600
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:24,045
Speaker 8:  and in that world where, where they can push it and actually there's revenue

601
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:26,885
Speaker 8:  opportunities there and you see it in the stock price and all that sort of

602
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:30,525
Speaker 8:  stuff. So they want to really push it on the consumer side as well and obviously

603
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:34,245
Speaker 8:  it hasn't skyrocketed to relevance. So, but I will say though that

604
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:37,805
Speaker 8:  I think it's the first time I've known people to be downloading the Bing

605
00:40:37,805 --> 00:40:41,485
Speaker 8:  mobile app or actually talking about Bing. Right? That's true. Yeah. So

606
00:40:41,585 --> 00:40:45,125
Speaker 8:  it is, it's had some sort of impact but obviously not not enough.

607
00:40:45,305 --> 00:40:48,045
Speaker 2:  And it does seem like, I will say credit where credit's due for Microsoft

608
00:40:48,105 --> 00:40:51,925
Speaker 2:  in terms of like baking copilot into the

609
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:55,405
Speaker 2:  office apps and stuff and, and sort of giving people like real

610
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:59,405
Speaker 2:  actual business uses for ai. It's done a better job I think

611
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:02,565
Speaker 2:  than anybody, right? Yeah. Chat sheet PT is sort of neater

612
00:41:03,345 --> 00:41:07,245
Speaker 2:  and Gemini is weird and whatever and as a, as consumer

613
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:10,725
Speaker 2:  brands, those are really the two that people talk about. But in terms of

614
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:14,245
Speaker 2:  like the whatever, $30 a month you're trying to get IT departments to pay

615
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:17,885
Speaker 2:  for, I actually think Microsoft is at least my own perception

616
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,365
Speaker 2:  ahead of everybody else on that front. So credit where credit's due for that.

617
00:41:21,715 --> 00:41:23,965
Speaker 2:  It's just, that's not a victory for Bing.

618
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:28,205
Speaker 8:  No, exactly. Like the good thing about copilot in in that

619
00:41:28,205 --> 00:41:31,525
Speaker 8:  office space is the teams integration where you can literally like, you know

620
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:35,325
Speaker 8:  how you're like, do I do really need to go to that meeting or not? Mm. Can

621
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:38,165
Speaker 8:  I catch up like the notes and you don't even have to worry about, you just

622
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:41,525
Speaker 8:  click on a link and it tells you if someone even spoke about you and you

623
00:41:41,525 --> 00:41:45,165
Speaker 8:  can just click like, and it will just instantly go to that part. It's like,

624
00:41:45,225 --> 00:41:47,605
Speaker 8:  oh that's awesome. It's pretty, yeah, it's pretty wild what they've done

625
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,605
Speaker 8:  for the team's integration and, and also like you, your Outlook,

626
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:54,805
Speaker 8:  like I tested out the copilot Pro stuff, which is for consumers actually

627
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:58,805
Speaker 8:  the team stuff isn't available for consumers but I tested that out and the

628
00:41:58,805 --> 00:42:01,685
Speaker 8:  most impressive part of that is you go into Outlook and there's an email,

629
00:42:01,705 --> 00:42:04,845
Speaker 8:  you summarized the email at the top of it. So, which is really useful when

630
00:42:04,845 --> 00:42:07,685
Speaker 8:  you have a back and forth with like customer support rep and you're like,

631
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:11,005
Speaker 8:  I can't even remember what I was doing in this email. Like there's, there's

632
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:14,965
Speaker 8:  loads of little interesting touch points to it. It's still a little

633
00:42:14,985 --> 00:42:18,565
Speaker 8:  bit still and it needs to mature and stuff. Yeah. But yeah they have, they

634
00:42:18,565 --> 00:42:22,045
Speaker 8:  have nailed some of it on the office side but on the Windows side they've

635
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:25,885
Speaker 8:  been promising a bunch of stuff and it hasn't, I'm, I'm not sure what this

636
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:28,605
Speaker 8:  A IPC stuff is yet so Yeah.

637
00:42:28,995 --> 00:42:32,845
Speaker 2:  Many of neither. So let's talk about that. Yeah. 'cause we came on this show

638
00:42:33,005 --> 00:42:36,245
Speaker 2:  a few weeks ago when Apple announced the new MacBook errors, right. And we

639
00:42:36,245 --> 00:42:39,885
Speaker 2:  made a lot of fun of Apple for saying that these are really great AI

640
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:43,885
Speaker 2:  PCs which amounted to essentially like you can do some photo

641
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:47,845
Speaker 2:  editing and also use the internet, thus these are AI

642
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,845
Speaker 2:  PCs, right. And Microsoft and Intel and others are out here making

643
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:55,925
Speaker 2:  all this noise also about AI PCs and they,

644
00:42:55,925 --> 00:42:59,325
Speaker 2:  they have the copilot key and it feels like if they want to be

645
00:42:59,805 --> 00:43:03,645
Speaker 2:  consumer winners in this space, it seems like Microsoft is betting a lot

646
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:06,125
Speaker 2:  on really having like a hardware

647
00:43:06,955 --> 00:43:10,845
Speaker 2:  instantiation of AI be the thing. Yeah. But like just

648
00:43:10,845 --> 00:43:14,805
Speaker 2:  back all the way up for me. Like when Microsoft says IPC, the hell is it

649
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:15,165
Speaker 2:  talking about?

650
00:43:15,705 --> 00:43:19,205
Speaker 8:  That's what I wanna know. Yeah. That's the key question at the moment.

651
00:43:19,685 --> 00:43:23,165
Speaker 8:  Yeah, like I think IPC is definitely a bit of a

652
00:43:23,275 --> 00:43:27,045
Speaker 8:  marketing term right now because Microsoft's saying all this stuff and

653
00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:31,445
Speaker 8:  it's like the definition which we actually learned this week from Intel is

654
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:35,085
Speaker 8:  that it needs to have the latest CPUs and GPUs and an

655
00:43:35,205 --> 00:43:38,565
Speaker 8:  NPU, right? So the newer processing unit, which is a chip that we've seen

656
00:43:38,565 --> 00:43:42,325
Speaker 8:  on a bunch of arm powered Windows laptops for years now. And

657
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:45,685
Speaker 8:  essentially it's been there and accelerates tasks like background blowing

658
00:43:45,825 --> 00:43:49,685
Speaker 8:  on a video call and like noise canceling when you're dog barking behind

659
00:43:49,685 --> 00:43:53,325
Speaker 8:  you on a, on a call. So there's obviously other instances and software

660
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:56,525
Speaker 8:  developers are working on stuff that will will be utilize there. But for

661
00:43:56,525 --> 00:44:00,125
Speaker 8:  all intents and purposes, that's the most consumer friendly option you have

662
00:44:00,185 --> 00:44:04,005
Speaker 8:  for that mpu right now. So what else is the MPU

663
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:07,605
Speaker 8:  gonna do? What other AI tasks are gonna leverage that in Windows? That's

664
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:11,005
Speaker 8:  still the mystery. So although Microsoft's come out saying here's our Surface

665
00:44:11,265 --> 00:44:15,085
Speaker 8:  Pro 10 for business, yes, that's the full name of the product in

666
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:18,685
Speaker 8:  itself, first Surface AI pc, it still

667
00:44:18,685 --> 00:44:22,405
Speaker 8:  doesn't really explain like why or like, 'cause the AI

668
00:44:22,405 --> 00:44:25,365
Speaker 8:  stuff that they have been pushing is co-pilot, which is cloud based. So it

669
00:44:25,365 --> 00:44:29,325
Speaker 8:  doesn't need an NPU right locally to accelerate or anything. So there's just

670
00:44:29,325 --> 00:44:33,125
Speaker 8:  that, that's a missing part of the puzzle and I think that's all gonna

671
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:37,045
Speaker 8:  make sense on May 20th when they, when they do this Surface and

672
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:37,725
Speaker 8:  Windows event.

673
00:44:38,115 --> 00:44:41,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. What do we know about the surfaces so far? Microsoft just released

674
00:44:41,885 --> 00:44:45,765
Speaker 2:  a couple of businesses surfaces. Yeah. Which seem like that

675
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:49,565
Speaker 2:  reading your story about them, you seem to see those as sort of a hint at

676
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:53,405
Speaker 2:  what we might see from the consumer facing surfaces, but also those might

677
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:56,925
Speaker 2:  be different. And I don't know like what, what, what's your sense of kind

678
00:44:56,925 --> 00:44:59,725
Speaker 2:  of how much we know about this next generation of services that's coming?

679
00:44:59,835 --> 00:45:03,085
Speaker 8:  Yeah, so it is, so they announced the Surface Pro 10 for business and the

680
00:45:03,085 --> 00:45:06,965
Speaker 8:  Surface Laptop six for business. And they're both running Intel

681
00:45:07,115 --> 00:45:10,885
Speaker 8:  core ultra chips, which do have NPUs. And I'd say

682
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:14,405
Speaker 8:  beyond that it's some webcam changes, but the designs are pretty much the

683
00:45:14,405 --> 00:45:18,125
Speaker 8:  same. It's not, it's, it's pretty much a a, a very plain release, but some

684
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:20,285
Speaker 8:  good upgrades for for business customers

685
00:45:20,505 --> 00:45:23,205
Speaker 2:  And the hardware's good. Like I like the Surface and the Surface Laptop.

686
00:45:23,205 --> 00:45:27,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So I think to the extent that it's like desperate for a

687
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:31,245
Speaker 2:  hardware redesign, like whatever, but I think that what you just described

688
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:35,045
Speaker 2:  to me in no way makes these things qualify as I PCs. No. So that,

689
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:38,405
Speaker 2:  that's still where I'm stuck, right? It's like what is the A IPC story inside

690
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:38,845
Speaker 2:  of this thing?

691
00:45:39,065 --> 00:45:43,005
Speaker 8:  So on May 20th they're gonna do the same devices but for consumers.

692
00:45:43,755 --> 00:45:47,325
Speaker 8:  Okay. There'll be some tweaks to designs. The Surface Proton is supposed

693
00:45:47,325 --> 00:45:50,565
Speaker 8:  to get an ole display, which is nice. There's all all all sorts of stuff

694
00:45:50,585 --> 00:45:54,325
Speaker 8:  you expect from the consumer side, but more importantly

695
00:45:54,325 --> 00:45:57,965
Speaker 8:  they're not gonna be Intel. So they're not gonna be core ultra

696
00:45:58,265 --> 00:46:01,965
Speaker 8:  PCs. They're gonna be Qualcomm Snap Drag and X Elite or Elite

697
00:46:02,045 --> 00:46:05,525
Speaker 8:  XI can't remember which way it goes. So ARM-based, which is

698
00:46:05,985 --> 00:46:09,725
Speaker 8:  not unusual for Microsoft to do ARM-based surfaces. They've done Surface

699
00:46:09,825 --> 00:46:13,125
Speaker 8:  Pro X in the past, but it's unusual for them to only do that for consumers.

700
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:15,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah. As the main option. That's a pretty big

701
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:19,205
Speaker 8:  Deal. And they, I mean they could I guess offer it later. It could be some

702
00:46:19,205 --> 00:46:23,005
Speaker 8:  sort of exclusive, but as far as I know, they're launching exclusively

703
00:46:23,005 --> 00:46:26,925
Speaker 8:  with Qualcomm, which is, I think that speaks to some sort of

704
00:46:26,925 --> 00:46:30,845
Speaker 8:  confidence in these Qualcomm chips because Qualcomm's been promising its

705
00:46:30,845 --> 00:46:34,445
Speaker 8:  performance to match MacBooks and stuff for years and it's never really delivered.

706
00:46:34,445 --> 00:46:34,965
Speaker 8:  Right. So

707
00:46:35,265 --> 00:46:39,125
Speaker 2:  The year of Windows on Arm has been every year for like a decade at this

708
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:39,565
Speaker 2:  point. Yeah,

709
00:46:39,565 --> 00:46:43,405
Speaker 8:  Yeah. But it seems like Microsoft is really confident, from what I

710
00:46:43,405 --> 00:46:47,285
Speaker 8:  understand internally, that they're going to even be able to beat M

711
00:46:47,285 --> 00:46:51,085
Speaker 8:  three performance, which is wow. Which is interesting. Yeah. 'cause even

712
00:46:51,085 --> 00:46:52,125
Speaker 8:  if they can beat like that

713
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,005
Speaker 2:  Would be a huge deal.

714
00:46:53,235 --> 00:46:57,165
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Like it, it, it seems like they're unusually confident, which I

715
00:46:57,165 --> 00:46:57,765
Speaker 8:  don't usually see,

716
00:46:58,325 --> 00:47:02,205
Speaker 2:  I mean forget M three performance, if it can get to like Apple's M1

717
00:47:02,205 --> 00:47:05,685
Speaker 2:  performance on these things. Oh yeah. Like that's a huge leap forward

718
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:09,165
Speaker 2:  both for Qualcomm in general, which can then go sell these things to other

719
00:47:09,165 --> 00:47:13,045
Speaker 2:  people also. But also for the Surface line. Yeah. Like that

720
00:47:13,045 --> 00:47:17,005
Speaker 2:  would make the Surface probably more interesting to more people

721
00:47:17,005 --> 00:47:18,645
Speaker 2:  than it has been in a really long time.

722
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:21,805
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think, I think it's gonna be super interesting obviously 'cause these

723
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:25,685
Speaker 8:  chips are obviously gonna go into regular laptops as well. Right. And it

724
00:47:25,685 --> 00:47:29,565
Speaker 8:  does feel like with the rumors of, was it a MD and Nvidia potentially

725
00:47:29,565 --> 00:47:32,405
Speaker 8:  doing Windows on Arm next year or the year after? I can't remember the exact

726
00:47:32,405 --> 00:47:36,085
Speaker 8:  year. It does feel like there's something going on here and Intel keeps

727
00:47:36,445 --> 00:47:40,085
Speaker 8:  inviting me to briefings about the Core Ultra. So they obviously know that

728
00:47:40,085 --> 00:47:43,245
Speaker 8:  something's going on. So I feel like there is something going on here, but

729
00:47:43,245 --> 00:47:46,765
Speaker 8:  I'm not fully committed to trusting that this is gonna be M three performance.

730
00:47:47,235 --> 00:47:51,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And in terms of the AI stuff, right, like I think the one part

731
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:54,565
Speaker 2:  of the AI story that I do buy is that basically

732
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:56,925
Speaker 2:  efficient performance goes a really long way.

733
00:47:57,225 --> 00:47:58,165
Speaker 8:  Yes. Definitely.

734
00:47:58,165 --> 00:48:01,805
Speaker 2:  Granted every computer with good performance and good battery life is a better

735
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:05,765
Speaker 2:  PC for ai. Yeah. Is that an AI pc? No, that's just like a

736
00:48:05,965 --> 00:48:09,805
Speaker 2:  pretty good Laptop. Yeah. In 2024. But I digress. But as you,

737
00:48:09,895 --> 00:48:13,525
Speaker 2:  we've seen Microsoft on the consumer side, I feel like try a bunch of

738
00:48:13,525 --> 00:48:17,085
Speaker 2:  different ways to put AI in front of people, right? There's big chat, they've

739
00:48:17,085 --> 00:48:19,325
Speaker 2:  made all this big deal about Edge, they're trying to put it in the start

740
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:23,285
Speaker 2:  menu. What's your sense of what, if anything is,

741
00:48:23,425 --> 00:48:27,325
Speaker 2:  is working there? Like what, what would you bet on kind of being the front

742
00:48:27,475 --> 00:48:29,805
Speaker 2:  face of AI on Windows going forward?

743
00:48:30,195 --> 00:48:34,045
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think co-pilot's definitely the front face. So Intel obviously

744
00:48:34,065 --> 00:48:37,445
Speaker 8:  had these specs and there was the chip side, but then there was the, it has

745
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:40,565
Speaker 8:  to have access to co-pilot software, which is like, sure it's Windows 11,

746
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:44,605
Speaker 8:  whatever. But it has to have the co-pilot key as well for it to be

747
00:48:44,745 --> 00:48:48,725
Speaker 8:  an AI PC in Microsoft's definition. Which is like, okay, interesting.

748
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:52,125
Speaker 2:  So it has to do AI and it has to have an AI button. Yeah, that's what I'm

749
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:53,165
Speaker 2:  hearing. That's it. And then it's an AI

750
00:48:53,165 --> 00:48:55,525
Speaker 8:  Pc. You get the AI stick, I dunno if they're gonna have stickers on these

751
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:57,445
Speaker 8:  things, but I mean, you never know.

752
00:48:57,635 --> 00:49:00,165
Speaker 2:  That would be amazing. Instead of Intel inside, it should just start saying

753
00:49:00,465 --> 00:49:02,325
Speaker 2:  AI inside AI inside. Like that's the stuff right there.

754
00:49:02,645 --> 00:49:05,965
Speaker 8:  That's it. But the copilot is definitely their, their portal

755
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:10,365
Speaker 8:  now. How they'll get away from it just being a chatbot or

756
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:13,645
Speaker 8:  seen as just a chatbot on on the side in Windows, which is basically what

757
00:49:13,645 --> 00:49:16,445
Speaker 8:  it is right now. That's gonna be interesting to see how it integrates for

758
00:49:16,445 --> 00:49:20,165
Speaker 8:  the apps. They do have something coming called, I think it's called AI

759
00:49:20,485 --> 00:49:24,325
Speaker 8:  Explorer and it sounds real creepy, but it's going to essentially record

760
00:49:24,325 --> 00:49:27,565
Speaker 8:  everything you do on your PC and then say you were, I dunno,

761
00:49:28,005 --> 00:49:31,845
Speaker 8:  researching a holiday last week, you could say to it, I was looking at

762
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:34,325
Speaker 8:  holidays last week, but I can't remember where it was. And then it'd be like,

763
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:38,285
Speaker 8:  oh, you were looking like holidays to Europe last week. Do

764
00:49:38,285 --> 00:49:41,205
Speaker 8:  you wanna check out the tabs that you had? Oh sure. And then you click and

765
00:49:41,205 --> 00:49:44,805
Speaker 8:  it brings up all the tabs you were working on, documents, whatever. So it's

766
00:49:44,805 --> 00:49:48,485
Speaker 8:  like a timeline of how you were using your PC and the state it was in and

767
00:49:48,825 --> 00:49:52,565
Speaker 8:  all that sort of stuff. Dunno exactly how it's gonna work in reality,

768
00:49:52,705 --> 00:49:55,645
Speaker 8:  but that's, that's what they've been, that's what, that's what they're building

769
00:49:55,645 --> 00:49:59,165
Speaker 8:  at the moment, essentially. So that's gonna be the The killer. The killer

770
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:03,125
Speaker 8:  feature for, 'cause it's gonna leverage the NPU obviously to, to quickly

771
00:50:03,275 --> 00:50:06,805
Speaker 8:  pull up this, this stuff and, and reference it, which sounds

772
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:11,165
Speaker 8:  very similar to the Windows 10 timeline feature they tried to do, which was

773
00:50:11,165 --> 00:50:14,765
Speaker 8:  like a similar sort of thing but sort of going across mobile apps.

774
00:50:15,185 --> 00:50:18,445
Speaker 8:  But it needed app support so it was kind of like dead in the wall without

775
00:50:18,445 --> 00:50:22,205
Speaker 8:  developers actually supporting it. This doesn't need app support, they can

776
00:50:22,205 --> 00:50:24,605
Speaker 8:  just do it 'cause they, you know, it runs on top of Windows,

777
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:26,165
Speaker 2:  It knows what's on the screen.

778
00:50:26,355 --> 00:50:28,605
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I mean privacy minefield. But yeah.

779
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:32,805
Speaker 2:  Well, yeah, I, I remember I wrote about this company Rewind, right?

780
00:50:32,805 --> 00:50:36,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Maybe a year ago that is doing something very similar and theirs is

781
00:50:36,405 --> 00:50:39,485
Speaker 2:  like a separate app that you download that then gets permission to record

782
00:50:39,485 --> 00:50:42,565
Speaker 2:  your screen and all this stuff. And in talking to people about that,

783
00:50:42,995 --> 00:50:46,925
Speaker 2:  everybody immediately goes one of two ways where it's like, oh awesome, that

784
00:50:46,925 --> 00:50:50,725
Speaker 2:  runs locally on my computer and doesn't go anywhere else. Kick ass.

785
00:50:50,725 --> 00:50:53,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah. What an incredible productivity tool that's gonna be. And then a bunch

786
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:56,645
Speaker 2:  of other people who are like absolutely not under no circumstances. Never

787
00:50:56,645 --> 00:51:00,005
Speaker 2:  ever, ever, ever, ever. Yeah. And I, I literally, I talked to a bunch of

788
00:51:00,005 --> 00:51:03,045
Speaker 2:  people around that story and found no one who is in the middle of those two

789
00:51:03,045 --> 00:51:03,525
Speaker 2:  points. Yeah.

790
00:51:03,525 --> 00:51:06,645
Speaker 8:  That I, I think that's definitely what this is gonna be like. It's, yeah,

791
00:51:06,955 --> 00:51:10,005
Speaker 8:  it's, it's obviously gonna run locally and all that, but it's still, it doesn't

792
00:51:10,005 --> 00:51:12,885
Speaker 8:  matter if it's recording you, it's still weird. Right. Yeah,

793
00:51:12,885 --> 00:51:16,805
Speaker 2:  I agree. But I will say if that becomes kind of part of the interface

794
00:51:16,805 --> 00:51:20,285
Speaker 2:  of a computer, which I actually think done well is pretty interesting, the

795
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:23,525
Speaker 2:  idea of like, 'cause you, I mean you think about your browser history, right?

796
00:51:23,525 --> 00:51:26,525
Speaker 2:  Like the fact that you can't sort of QWERTY your browser history to be like,

797
00:51:26,525 --> 00:51:29,925
Speaker 2:  what was that page I was looking at about X, Y and Z is silly. Like you should

798
00:51:29,925 --> 00:51:32,965
Speaker 2:  be able to do that. The information's right there. Yeah. It has it anyway.

799
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:36,765
Speaker 2:  Right? So to be able to take information that like of course it already

800
00:51:36,825 --> 00:51:40,405
Speaker 2:  has and do something with it, that's a pretty compelling use of

801
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:45,005
Speaker 2:  AI to me. Again, I, I wonder what that will look like and whether

802
00:51:45,065 --> 00:51:48,805
Speaker 2:  it will totally collapse this supposed good performance of battery

803
00:51:48,835 --> 00:51:49,765
Speaker 2:  life of my computer.

804
00:51:49,955 --> 00:51:53,645
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And and a advertising companies basically have access to your search

805
00:51:53,645 --> 00:51:56,125
Speaker 8:  history. I mean not, not in the literal sense exactly, but by tracking you

806
00:51:56,145 --> 00:52:00,085
Speaker 8:  all around the web. So, and they can make relevant queries. So it would

807
00:52:00,085 --> 00:52:04,005
Speaker 8:  be really useful to be able to look back in useful AI powered ways.

808
00:52:04,345 --> 00:52:07,645
Speaker 8:  So yeah, I see the, I see the big benefits of it. It's just how they sell

809
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:09,965
Speaker 8:  it and the previous aspects and everything else.

810
00:52:10,465 --> 00:52:14,445
Speaker 2:  Do you think all the other Windows manufacturers are gonna be into

811
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:17,885
Speaker 2:  the copilot idea and co-pilot key the same way that Microsoft is?

812
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:21,685
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think probably because usually they, they follow,

813
00:52:22,085 --> 00:52:23,885
Speaker 2:  I guess they don't have much choice in a lot of

814
00:52:23,885 --> 00:52:27,485
Speaker 8:  Cases. Yeah. And Microsoft will say you can put, you know, some of your stuff

815
00:52:27,485 --> 00:52:30,885
Speaker 8:  where you can make a tiny bit of revenue on everything and they have all

816
00:52:30,885 --> 00:52:34,605
Speaker 8:  these big deals with OEMs to incentivize all this sort of stuff so that

817
00:52:34,605 --> 00:52:38,365
Speaker 8:  they'll have like marketing deals. It would just basically be

818
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:41,205
Speaker 8:  one of those things where it's like if you're an OEM, you kind of have to

819
00:52:41,205 --> 00:52:44,925
Speaker 8:  go with it because we, we obviously saw in the past support for Windows

820
00:52:44,985 --> 00:52:48,285
Speaker 8:  and Arm from a bunch of OEMs. Some of them pulled it pretty quick, but they

821
00:52:48,285 --> 00:52:52,165
Speaker 8:  all kind of, most of them did one or two models just in support

822
00:52:52,165 --> 00:52:55,525
Speaker 8:  of it. So I think, I think there will be support for it. I think most of

823
00:52:55,525 --> 00:52:59,325
Speaker 8:  them will probably ship the copilot key eventually as well, even

824
00:52:59,325 --> 00:53:03,245
Speaker 8:  if not all of them have yet. But yeah, I think it'll be pretty broadly

825
00:53:03,245 --> 00:53:03,805
Speaker 8:  supported.

826
00:53:04,195 --> 00:53:07,805
Speaker 2:  Okay. And for Microsoft, it seems like this event in May

827
00:53:08,645 --> 00:53:11,565
Speaker 2:  actually turns out to be a pretty big deal, even if it is, you know,

828
00:53:12,525 --> 00:53:16,245
Speaker 2:  relative sort of spec updates of things. Like, I, I don't know, my, my last

829
00:53:16,445 --> 00:53:19,125
Speaker 2:  question for you was basically gonna be like, what do we think year two of

830
00:53:19,765 --> 00:53:23,125
Speaker 2:  Microsoft's all in on AI BET is gonna look like? Right? And I kind of feel

831
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:26,045
Speaker 2:  like what it sounds like is we're gonna know the answer to that much more

832
00:53:26,045 --> 00:53:29,845
Speaker 2:  clearly when we see this new hardware that like that is going to be

833
00:53:29,905 --> 00:53:31,725
Speaker 2:  the way to see what all this looks like.

834
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:35,805
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think the, the key is the Snapdragon chip, like how, how that performs

835
00:53:35,805 --> 00:53:39,445
Speaker 8:  if it lands, well then you can imagine there's gonna be next gen AI

836
00:53:39,785 --> 00:53:43,405
Speaker 8:  PCs, which they, they will see talking about internally. I think these are

837
00:53:43,645 --> 00:53:47,005
Speaker 8:  considered next gen, whereas perhaps the stuff that's in the market right

838
00:53:47,005 --> 00:53:50,645
Speaker 8:  now of NPUs is, is you know, current gen or whatever. But yeah, I think year

839
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:54,325
Speaker 8:  two will be, I hope it's like more fleshing out windows

840
00:53:54,505 --> 00:53:57,805
Speaker 8:  and how it's actually using all this, this NPU power

841
00:53:58,505 --> 00:54:02,245
Speaker 8:  and leveraging it all locally on the device. 'cause it's still, that's

842
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:06,125
Speaker 8:  the main feature. I think there's gonna also be a, a video streaming

843
00:54:06,155 --> 00:54:10,005
Speaker 8:  improvement as well. That's the other kind of main feature that they, they're,

844
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:13,285
Speaker 8:  there's two features that they're, they're kinda selling for the next gen

845
00:54:13,665 --> 00:54:15,885
Speaker 8:  AI PCs, but marketing slogan,

846
00:54:16,275 --> 00:54:19,805
Speaker 2:  It's interesting to hear you talk about AI as the sort of startup

847
00:54:19,945 --> 00:54:23,205
Speaker 2:  inside of Microsoft. It like, it actually makes a lot of the last 12 months

848
00:54:23,205 --> 00:54:26,485
Speaker 2:  make a lot of sense. Yeah. Both in terms of this sort of like

849
00:54:26,845 --> 00:54:30,205
Speaker 2:  flailing around all over Windows trying to figure out what to do. But also

850
00:54:30,205 --> 00:54:34,085
Speaker 2:  some of the stuff like the growth hacking inside of Edge, right? Yeah. And

851
00:54:34,085 --> 00:54:37,685
Speaker 2:  inside of Windows, like that's the kind of stuff that big mature companies

852
00:54:37,825 --> 00:54:39,965
Speaker 2:  do less of, but startups do lots of.

853
00:54:40,225 --> 00:54:40,845
Speaker 8:  Yes. Yep.

854
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:44,885
Speaker 2:  And that culture clash I think is like maybe why it

855
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:48,605
Speaker 2:  felt so bad as a user to get some of that stuff over the last year where

856
00:54:48,605 --> 00:54:51,005
Speaker 2:  it's like, Microsoft, this is gross. Like leave me alone. I'm just trying

857
00:54:51,005 --> 00:54:52,525
Speaker 2:  to use your web browser for god's sake.

858
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:55,285
Speaker 8:  But it's, it's interesting because the Windows engineers have obviously gone

859
00:54:55,285 --> 00:54:59,245
Speaker 8:  back to the Surface side, but they've kept Bing Edge and copilot on

860
00:54:59,245 --> 00:55:03,165
Speaker 8:  that Microsoft AI side. So that does suggest that they'll be doing

861
00:55:03,705 --> 00:55:07,645
Speaker 8:  all of the AI work within those, those three brands. So we might

862
00:55:07,665 --> 00:55:11,445
Speaker 8:  not get as, I dunno as as pushy, hopefully as

863
00:55:11,445 --> 00:55:15,125
Speaker 8:  pushy stuff in the Windows experience itself. Yeah. So,

864
00:55:15,265 --> 00:55:17,245
Speaker 2:  But Edge is probably still gonna be messy.

865
00:55:17,805 --> 00:55:20,885
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I did wanna mention one thing that, yeah, the interesting thing that

866
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:24,725
Speaker 8:  I think they're gonna say, and I, well I I kind of know from sources is,

867
00:55:24,745 --> 00:55:28,525
Speaker 8:  you know how Microsoft used to say a PC in every home was like the Windows

868
00:55:28,545 --> 00:55:32,365
Speaker 8:  slogan, right? It's gonna be a copilot for every person. Like

869
00:55:32,365 --> 00:55:35,725
Speaker 8:  that's how they're gonna sell this now. Oh yeah. And, and they're hoping

870
00:55:35,825 --> 00:55:39,725
Speaker 8:  to get to like 50% of new laptops, like by

871
00:55:39,725 --> 00:55:43,645
Speaker 8:  the end of 2026 will be, you know, have all these, all

872
00:55:43,645 --> 00:55:44,845
Speaker 8:  the NPU hardware on them.

873
00:55:45,405 --> 00:55:46,885
Speaker 2:  Interesting. And that's very telling. Yeah.

874
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,565
Speaker 8:  When you get to that scale then it's, it's quite telling of their, their

875
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:51,965
Speaker 8:  ambitions and where they might go with us. So

876
00:55:52,195 --> 00:55:54,845
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. All right, well we're, we're gonna have to check back in in

877
00:55:54,845 --> 00:55:58,125
Speaker 2:  May. I'm so skeptical of these Qualcomm chips. Tom, I cannot even tell you

878
00:55:58,315 --> 00:55:59,565
Speaker 2:  same boy. I hope they're awesome.

879
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:03,445
Speaker 8:  I'm so skeptical of I PC slogan marketing

880
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:04,325
Speaker 8:  nonsense.

881
00:56:04,435 --> 00:56:08,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. If anyone knows what an AI PC is, please email us birch cast@birch.com.

882
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:09,205
Speaker 2:  I wanna know. I wanna

883
00:56:09,205 --> 00:56:09,605
Speaker 8:  Know too.

884
00:56:10,945 --> 00:56:13,645
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take one more break and we'll be right back with the

885
00:56:13,645 --> 00:56:15,245
Speaker 2:  first cast. Hotline. Thank you sir.

886
00:56:15,245 --> 00:56:16,045
Speaker 8:  Alright, thank you.

887
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:25,125
Speaker 9:  Hi, I'm Taylor Lorenz, host of Power User. You've probably seen

888
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:28,605
Speaker 9:  those videos on TikTok where somebody gives money to a stranger who's down

889
00:56:28,605 --> 00:56:31,565
Speaker 9:  on their luck. It all seems really warm and fuzzy

890
00:56:32,385 --> 00:56:32,805
Speaker 9:  except

891
00:56:33,315 --> 00:56:37,245
Speaker 10:  They never see the person who's embarrassed by it, who never wanted

892
00:56:37,245 --> 00:56:37,765
Speaker 10:  to be a part of

893
00:57:22,445 --> 00:57:26,285

Speaker 2:  8 6 6 Verge one one. The email is Vergecast at The Verge dot com.

901
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:05,315
Speaker 2:  We love all of your questions. We try to answer at least one on the show

902
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,515
Speaker 2:  every week. Thank you to everybody who has been calling in. The questions

903
00:58:08,515 --> 00:58:12,475
Speaker 2:  have been so weird the last few weeks. I love it. I wish we

904
00:58:12,475 --> 00:58:14,875
Speaker 2:  could do more of them. We're gonna do more of them. We've definitely gotta

905
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:17,955
Speaker 2:  do a Hotline episode soon because we've got a bunch of really fun ones to

906
00:58:17,955 --> 00:58:20,595
Speaker 2:  get into. For now we have a question from Josh.

907
00:58:21,935 --> 00:58:25,795
Speaker 12:  Hey David, this is Josh calling from Northern Washington State.

908
00:58:26,435 --> 00:58:30,275
Speaker 12:  I recently watched a World War II documentary on Netflix, which is pretty

909
00:58:30,655 --> 00:58:34,275
Speaker 12:  meh. Now my question is, I like World War II

910
00:58:34,475 --> 00:58:38,135
Speaker 12:  documentaries, so how should I rate this

911
00:58:38,355 --> 00:58:42,255
Speaker 12:  on Netflix? Should I give it the thumbs up, the two thumbs up or the thumbs

912
00:58:42,255 --> 00:58:45,855
Speaker 12:  down because I wanna see more World War II documentaries. So

913
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:50,055
Speaker 12:  how does the algorithm take it? If I say thumbs down, will it not

914
00:58:50,415 --> 00:58:53,655
Speaker 12:  recommend any more documentaries for me? Or if I give it two thumbs up,

915
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:57,095
Speaker 12:  would it say, oh, you like mediocre documentaries, I'm gonna recommend more

916
00:58:57,095 --> 00:59:00,815
Speaker 12:  mediocre documentaries for you. I'm really confused on how to train the

917
00:59:01,085 --> 00:59:04,895
Speaker 12:  algorithm when it comes to mediocre shows and all of these

918
00:59:04,905 --> 00:59:08,455
Speaker 12:  algorithms that you know, really want to show me things rather than me letting

919
00:59:08,475 --> 00:59:11,335
Speaker 12:  me choose things. Really appreciate your help with this. Thanks.

920
00:59:12,145 --> 00:59:15,165
Speaker 2:  If you've been listening to this show for a while, you know that recommendation

921
00:59:15,165 --> 00:59:19,005
Speaker 2:  systems are like an obsession of mine. So in order to answer this

922
00:59:19,165 --> 00:59:23,085
Speaker 2:  question, I went back to an interview I did last year with Pat Fleming,

923
00:59:23,085 --> 00:59:27,045
Speaker 2:  who is a senior director of product management at Netflix. Basically

924
00:59:27,065 --> 00:59:31,005
Speaker 2:  he runs the member experience team. So everything that you do when you

925
00:59:31,005 --> 00:59:34,765
Speaker 2:  use the app, that is his responsibility. And one of the things that is his

926
00:59:34,765 --> 00:59:38,645
Speaker 2:  responsibility is all of this recommendation stuff. You can listen to

927
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:42,685
Speaker 2:  a lot of our interview in an episode from last fall. I'll put that in the

928
00:59:42,685 --> 00:59:46,365
Speaker 2:  show notes. But one of the things we talked about specifically was

929
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:50,325
Speaker 2:  basically how to tell Netflix what you do and don't want to watch.

930
00:59:50,745 --> 00:59:54,365
Speaker 2:  He gave me a bunch of information on kind of what Netflix cares about, what

931
00:59:54,365 --> 00:59:58,245
Speaker 2:  it's paying attention to, what you can do to signal it, all this good

932
00:59:58,245 --> 01:00:02,045
Speaker 2:  stuff. So the first one is, let me just play you a clip from that interview

933
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:06,125
Speaker 2:  in which he described a few of the things that Netflix is looking for. The

934
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:10,005
Speaker 2:  biggest one is what you watch, what you watch and don't matters

935
01:00:10,035 --> 01:00:13,725
Speaker 2:  most. But here is Pat describing some of what Netflix cares about.

936
01:00:14,265 --> 01:00:18,085
Speaker 13:  You could think of titles as being broken down into these constituent components.

937
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:21,565
Speaker 13:  This metadata, it's, is it a movie or a film? What's its originating country?

938
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:25,365
Speaker 13:  How long is it? What language is it available in genre? Perhaps

939
01:00:25,635 --> 01:00:28,845
Speaker 13:  some tagging about attributes of the title. And those things all help to

940
01:00:28,845 --> 01:00:32,525
Speaker 13:  sort of round out what a title is like and then you match that against member

941
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:36,565
Speaker 13:  taste and preferences and take that sports docs, drama,

942
01:00:36,825 --> 01:00:40,445
Speaker 13:  baking shows, If, you watch any two of those things and lots of people watch

943
01:00:40,465 --> 01:00:43,765
Speaker 13:  all three of those things, then it's a pretty good chance that that third

944
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:47,565
Speaker 13:  genre might be interesting to you. And so some point in time you'll discover

945
01:00:47,565 --> 01:00:50,325
Speaker 13:  some genre that what wouldn't otherwise have been your consciousness and

946
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:51,245
Speaker 13:  try it out on Netflix.

947
01:00:52,105 --> 01:00:55,285
Speaker 2:  One of the other things Pat and I talked a lot about was these thumbs. I've

948
01:00:55,285 --> 01:00:58,445
Speaker 2:  always been fascinated by the thumbs versus stars thing.

949
01:00:58,925 --> 01:01:02,845
Speaker 2:  Here's actually how Pat described why Netflix goes with the thumbs

950
01:01:02,845 --> 01:01:06,725
Speaker 2:  thing. Two thumbs up, one thumbs up or thumbs down. Instead of like a zero

951
01:01:06,825 --> 01:01:07,765
Speaker 2:  to five stars ranking.

952
01:01:08,275 --> 01:01:11,525
Speaker 13:  When you really love it, give it two thumbs up When you love it, give it

953
01:01:11,525 --> 01:01:14,325
Speaker 13:  a thumbs up and If, you didn't like it, that's okay, let us know. Give it

954
01:01:14,325 --> 01:01:16,685
Speaker 13:  a thumbs down. So that's one very concrete way.

955
01:01:17,365 --> 01:01:20,925
Speaker 2:  I actually like that explanation a lot and it really makes sense to me. I

956
01:01:20,925 --> 01:01:24,725
Speaker 2:  think about things like Yelp where everything seems to be 3.5

957
01:01:24,725 --> 01:01:28,525
Speaker 2:  stars and you don't know whether that's good or bad. Any restaurant on Yelp

958
01:01:28,525 --> 01:01:31,965
Speaker 2:  that's over four stars I assume is great and anything that's under like

959
01:01:31,965 --> 01:01:35,805
Speaker 2:  3.8 I assume is awful. That doesn't make any sense, but that's

960
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:38,925
Speaker 2:  kind of where we are. And then you get in an Uber and anything other than

961
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:42,565
Speaker 2:  five stars essentially means I would like for you to be fired, which also

962
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:46,285
Speaker 2:  doesn't make any sense. So we're in this odd place where different levels

963
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,605
Speaker 2:  of stars mean different things depending on where you are and there's no

964
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:53,645
Speaker 2:  real rubric for it. So I think in this case the thumbs up, thumbs down

965
01:01:53,645 --> 01:01:57,365
Speaker 2:  thing is much easier to parse. But again, for our friend Josh

966
01:01:57,365 --> 01:02:01,165
Speaker 2:  here, not quite as easy to parse. One more thing about the thumbs. I

967
01:02:01,165 --> 01:02:05,045
Speaker 2:  think this is actually kind of relevant, which is that a thumbs down

968
01:02:05,505 --> 01:02:09,205
Speaker 2:  is very important. So what I would say in this case is, unless you

969
01:02:09,495 --> 01:02:12,965
Speaker 2:  truly loath this documentary and don't ever wanna see anything like it,

970
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:17,365
Speaker 2:  do not thumbs down. Because what I heard from Pat is that they'd love

971
01:02:17,365 --> 01:02:20,965
Speaker 2:  to have more information about why you gave something a thumbs down,

972
01:02:21,425 --> 01:02:22,245
Speaker 2:  but they really don't.

973
01:02:22,665 --> 01:02:26,125
Speaker 13:  The magic would be the longer that you spend, the better that final

974
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:29,565
Speaker 13:  recommendation would be because we would then known so much more about the

975
01:02:29,565 --> 01:02:31,605
Speaker 13:  things you could have been interested in and might not have been interested

976
01:02:31,605 --> 01:02:34,965
Speaker 13:  in. So one thing that's a little more challenging is extracting

977
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:39,085
Speaker 13:  say negative feedback from you. So it would be nice for us to know with

978
01:02:39,085 --> 01:02:42,205
Speaker 13:  a little bit more precision when you skip over something, whether you spend

979
01:02:42,205 --> 01:02:45,685
Speaker 13:  a little bit of time with a trailer and you say, oh, that's not for me tonight.

980
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,925
Speaker 13:  Sometimes that's a little more challenging for us to know precisely in the

981
01:02:48,925 --> 01:02:50,885
Speaker 13:  moment. And that's an area where we wanna spend a little more time.

982
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:55,245
Speaker 2:  So basically where Pat landed on that one is if you're going to

983
01:02:55,665 --> 01:02:58,765
Speaker 2:  do a thumbs down, they're going to take that as a very strong signal that

984
01:02:58,765 --> 01:03:01,765
Speaker 2:  you don't wanna see this anymore. And it's possible that over time Netflix

985
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:05,045
Speaker 2:  will get better at understanding what you mean by that. Whether like Pat

986
01:03:05,075 --> 01:03:07,765
Speaker 2:  said, you never wanna see it again or you just don't wanna see it tonight,

987
01:03:08,225 --> 01:03:11,405
Speaker 2:  but I would use that pretty sparingly and as a kind of

988
01:03:11,975 --> 01:03:15,805
Speaker 2:  gavel that just says, get this out of my face. So that's a thumbs down. Wouldn't

989
01:03:15,805 --> 01:03:19,445
Speaker 2:  do that for this one. So we're down to one thumbs up or two thumbs up for

990
01:03:19,445 --> 01:03:23,045
Speaker 2:  this one here is how Pat described the difference, which I would argue is

991
01:03:23,045 --> 01:03:24,765
Speaker 2:  both helpful and unhelpful.

992
01:03:25,265 --> 01:03:29,205
Speaker 13:  Thumbs is a simple way for you to provide feedback

993
01:03:29,265 --> 01:03:32,485
Speaker 13:  on whether you like something or didn't like something. The the trick on

994
01:03:32,485 --> 01:03:36,405
Speaker 13:  stars is sometimes you might rate something very highly on the stars because

995
01:03:36,465 --> 01:03:39,405
Speaker 13:  that's how something you think something ought to be perceived. So it's

996
01:03:39,605 --> 01:03:43,205
Speaker 13:  critically acclaimed and and so you feel like it, it deserves many stars

997
01:03:43,385 --> 01:03:46,605
Speaker 13:  as opposed to how did you actually feel about it? And that's what's more

998
01:03:46,605 --> 01:03:50,565
Speaker 13:  meaningful to improve your recommendations is the reflection of

999
01:03:50,985 --> 01:03:54,325
Speaker 13:  how you actually felt about something and whether it was good for you. And

1000
01:03:54,325 --> 01:03:58,245
Speaker 13:  so thumbs has the benefit of one being simpler and two,

1001
01:03:58,245 --> 01:04:01,965
Speaker 13:  hopefully being a better reflection of what you actually love

1002
01:04:02,065 --> 01:04:04,365
Speaker 13:  or didn't love about what you're watching on Netflix.

1003
01:04:05,035 --> 01:04:08,885
Speaker 2:  Okay? Right. Helpful and unhelpful. But I would say for you Josh,

1004
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:12,645
Speaker 2:  I think we are squarely in one thumbs up

1005
01:04:13,165 --> 01:04:16,885
Speaker 2:  territory. To me, I think of it as one thumbs up is like,

1006
01:04:17,405 --> 01:04:21,005
Speaker 2:  I had a nice time or I'm glad I watched this,

1007
01:04:21,265 --> 01:04:25,245
Speaker 2:  or I'm psyched that this exists and was being recommended to

1008
01:04:25,245 --> 01:04:28,565
Speaker 2:  me. It's kind of like a, anything that you see that you'd make the noise

1009
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:31,925
Speaker 2:  of just like, yeah, it was good. Like that to me is one thumbs up, right?

1010
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:35,965
Speaker 2:  It's not, I'm staking my reputation on the quality of this.

1011
01:04:35,965 --> 01:04:38,765
Speaker 2:  This is the greatest thing that I've ever seen. I would watch this every

1012
01:04:38,765 --> 01:04:42,125
Speaker 2:  single day if it made sense for me to do so. It's just like, yeah, it's,

1013
01:04:42,205 --> 01:04:45,285
Speaker 2:  I had a nice time. It's how I feel about like 95% of movies I've ever watched

1014
01:04:45,305 --> 01:04:49,165
Speaker 2:  on planes, right? Not the worst way to spend two hours. We'll do it again.

1015
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:53,005
Speaker 2:  Probably not going to write about it in my diary at the end of the day. Whereas

1016
01:04:53,145 --> 01:04:57,005
Speaker 2:  two thumbs up is like, yes, please Netflix ruin

1017
01:04:57,385 --> 01:05:01,245
Speaker 2:  my recommendations with this one. I wanna see everything that you

1018
01:05:01,245 --> 01:05:05,045
Speaker 2:  think is associated with this specific title. The people who made it

1019
01:05:05,105 --> 01:05:08,965
Speaker 2:  the thing it's about when it came out, what it looks like, the colors in

1020
01:05:08,965 --> 01:05:12,245
Speaker 2:  the background in the third scene. Like yes, Netflix, yes.

1021
01:05:12,905 --> 01:05:16,485
Speaker 2:  And I don't think we're there on this one. So I think we are squarely

1022
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:20,485
Speaker 2:  in one thumbs up territory. I'd be curious to know what

1023
01:05:20,485 --> 01:05:24,245
Speaker 2:  everybody else thinks, how you would rate this. But I feel like I'm saying

1024
01:05:24,395 --> 01:05:28,165
Speaker 2:  yeah, show me more stuff kind of like this. But I want you to know this was

1025
01:05:28,165 --> 01:05:32,045
Speaker 2:  not the best version of this one. Thumb up. Before I go though,

1026
01:05:32,205 --> 01:05:34,525
Speaker 2:  I went back through the interview with Pat and tried to pull out a bunch

1027
01:05:34,525 --> 01:05:38,485
Speaker 2:  of the things that he told me about how to signal to Netflix what you do

1028
01:05:38,485 --> 01:05:41,245
Speaker 2:  and don't like. So lemme just run through a few of them. One of the ones

1029
01:05:41,245 --> 01:05:45,085
Speaker 2:  that he said is If. you go to the upcoming stuff, the stuff that hasn't come

1030
01:05:45,085 --> 01:05:48,925
Speaker 2:  out on Netflix yet. If, you watch a trailer for something, but especially

1031
01:05:49,265 --> 01:05:52,925
Speaker 2:  If, you hit the remind me button to get notified when something comes out

1032
01:05:53,145 --> 01:05:56,845
Speaker 2:  that's a super strong signal that you like that stuff. It means you went

1033
01:05:56,985 --> 01:06:00,965
Speaker 2:  way out of your way to actually go and get it and declare your

1034
01:06:00,965 --> 01:06:04,685
Speaker 2:  intention to watch it to Netflix. That's a super strong signal. So is watching

1035
01:06:04,685 --> 01:06:08,605
Speaker 2:  stuff to the end. Netflix cares a lot about where you fall out of a show,

1036
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:12,325
Speaker 2:  so the more of it you watch the better. And I would say even in the case

1037
01:06:12,325 --> 01:06:16,285
Speaker 2:  of like a documentary you oughta like but isn't your favorite If, you just

1038
01:06:16,285 --> 01:06:20,005
Speaker 2:  sort of leave it on and leave the room until it ends. That's a pretty good

1039
01:06:20,005 --> 01:06:23,365
Speaker 2:  signal that you wanna see more of this. Whereas If, you shut it off after

1040
01:06:23,365 --> 01:06:26,325
Speaker 2:  three minutes. That might be a strong signal that you don't, all of this

1041
01:06:26,345 --> 01:06:30,165
Speaker 2:  is tricky push and pull stuff, but how far you watch is a strong signal.

1042
01:06:30,475 --> 01:06:34,445
Speaker 2:  What you scroll past is also a strong signal. This kind

1043
01:06:34,445 --> 01:06:37,925
Speaker 2:  of goes with the thumbs down that Pat was talking about where if I scroll

1044
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:41,805
Speaker 2:  past 10 thumbnails of things, it's very hard for Netflix to figure

1045
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:45,845
Speaker 2:  out why I don't wanna watch those things, but it knows that I don't wanna

1046
01:06:45,845 --> 01:06:48,965
Speaker 2:  watch those things and it's getting stronger and stronger at

1047
01:06:49,645 --> 01:06:52,765
Speaker 2:  recommending stuff after that, right? It can say not only here's what you

1048
01:06:52,765 --> 01:06:55,085
Speaker 2:  watched and liked, but okay, you don't wanna watch this, you don't wanna

1049
01:06:55,085 --> 01:06:57,645
Speaker 2:  watch this, you don't wanna watch this. Oh that must mean you're in the mood

1050
01:06:57,665 --> 01:07:01,485
Speaker 2:  for a movie or a cooking show or whatever it has to be. And so that

1051
01:07:01,485 --> 01:07:05,325
Speaker 2:  stuff is coming more slowly, but actually what you don't watch is

1052
01:07:05,405 --> 01:07:09,285
Speaker 2:  a real signal. So is what you search for. Even when you search for

1053
01:07:09,285 --> 01:07:12,765
Speaker 2:  stuff that's not on Netflix If, you go in and type in the title of something,

1054
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:16,685
Speaker 2:  it'll both give you the recommendations for things similar to that that you

1055
01:07:16,685 --> 01:07:19,725
Speaker 2:  might watch on Netflix, which again, If, you go watch Strong Signal that

1056
01:07:19,725 --> 01:07:23,565
Speaker 2:  you like that, but also it just shows Netflix what you care about. It's

1057
01:07:23,725 --> 01:07:26,565
Speaker 2:  tracking that stuff. It wants to know what you wanna watch, even the stuff

1058
01:07:26,805 --> 01:07:30,525
Speaker 2:  that's not on Netflix. So that is a strong signal. One other one is

1059
01:07:30,715 --> 01:07:33,765
Speaker 2:  just the taste profile that you have. I don't know, If, you do this too,

1060
01:07:33,765 --> 01:07:37,405
Speaker 2:  but I always just leap through the thing at the very beginning of any

1061
01:07:37,495 --> 01:07:40,525
Speaker 2:  music service or streaming service or whatever where it's like pick three

1062
01:07:40,525 --> 01:07:43,525
Speaker 2:  titles that you like. But it turns out that's actually pretty important and

1063
01:07:43,675 --> 01:07:47,445
Speaker 2:  goes a long way towards sort of kick-starting the personalization that

1064
01:07:47,445 --> 01:07:51,245
Speaker 2:  Netflix and all these other services do. So if you're new to Netflix or

1065
01:07:51,245 --> 01:07:54,205
Speaker 2:  If, you want to go back in and do it again. That is a thing you can do. And

1066
01:07:54,205 --> 01:07:57,125
Speaker 2:  it is apparently more important than I have given it credit for. It's called

1067
01:07:57,125 --> 01:08:00,405
Speaker 2:  your Taste Profile and Netflix cares a lot about it. But again, the single

1068
01:08:00,405 --> 01:08:03,805
Speaker 2:  most important thing you can do according to Pat, it's just watch stuff.

1069
01:08:04,265 --> 01:08:08,125
Speaker 2:  It is much more attuned to what you click on and

1070
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:11,925
Speaker 2:  what you actually watch than anything else. So I'm kind of in this

1071
01:08:12,085 --> 01:08:15,725
Speaker 2:  position where every time I scroll on Netflix or click on anything, I'm petrified

1072
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:19,205
Speaker 2:  of what I'm teaching the algorithm. I think we all feel this way about YouTube

1073
01:08:19,305 --> 01:08:21,885
Speaker 2:  and TikTok and all these other things where it's like, oh no, did I linger

1074
01:08:21,945 --> 01:08:24,725
Speaker 2:  too long? Is the app gonna think I like this and show too much of it? To

1075
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:28,285
Speaker 2:  me, I think Netflix is working on that a little bit. But again,

1076
01:08:28,545 --> 01:08:32,245
Speaker 2:  the fact that you went in and watched this whole documentary is a

1077
01:08:32,605 --> 01:08:36,525
Speaker 2:  stronger signal to Netflix than how you rate it. So If, you

1078
01:08:36,525 --> 01:08:39,245
Speaker 2:  want more of these documentaries. I wouldn't worry too much about it. Just

1079
01:08:39,245 --> 01:08:43,085
Speaker 2:  keep watching the documentaries. That's my main advice. One thumb up for

1080
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:46,005
Speaker 2:  Netflix, two thumbs up for cool documentaries.

1081
01:08:49,465 --> 01:08:52,725
Speaker 2:  All right, that is it for The Vergecast today. Thank you to everybody on
