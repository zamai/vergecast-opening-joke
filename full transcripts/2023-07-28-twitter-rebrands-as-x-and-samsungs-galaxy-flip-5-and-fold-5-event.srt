00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,420
Speaker 1:  The 14th season of The Real Housewives of New York just premiered

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,820
Speaker 1:  with an entirely new cast. And yet the show is just

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,460
Speaker 1:  as addictive as it's always been.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,700
Speaker 2:  The thing about Housewives is it's a little bit like

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,540
Speaker 2:  Saturday Night Live. As much as people kind of come in and go out of it,

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,660
Speaker 2:  the franchise is stronger than any of the players.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,500
Speaker 1:  We break down the lasting influence of The Real Housewives

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,500
Speaker 1:  and we rank our favorites this week on Intuit

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,500
Speaker 1:  Vultures Pop Culture podcast.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,900
Speaker 4:  On criminal, we bring you true crime stories told

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,620
Speaker 4:  by people who know them best.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,740
Speaker 5:  We didn't believe in setting fires 'cause that was too dangerous. We were,

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,540
Speaker 5:  you know, a, a kind, a gentler kind of crooks, so to speak.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,380
Speaker 4:  So the best plan you had was that you'd lasso it?

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,020
Speaker 6:  Yes. Never imagined I'd use it for a camel.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,380
Speaker 4:  I'm Phoebe Judge, and this is criminal. Did you have to say

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,420
Speaker 4:  what was in the box,

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,340
Speaker 3:  Phoebe? We told lies.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,060
Speaker 4:  Listen to criminal every week, wherever you get your podcasts.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,750
Speaker 3:  Hello

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,190
Speaker 7:  And welcome to the Rich Cast, the flagship podcast of rebranding your company

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,350
Speaker 7:  from one name to nothing. It's great. It's, that's what you want

24
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,070
Speaker 7:  when you have a company, is to pick one of the most common letters

25
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,950
Speaker 7:  for naming things for teenage boys. It's great. I'm your friend Neil. I'm

26
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,510
Speaker 7:  in a hotel room in San Francisco for this episode of The Vergecast. I'm gonna

27
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,550
Speaker 7:  try not to look at my laptop 'cause I think it'll look bad on, on the YouTube

28
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,550
Speaker 7:  video. So, Alex Cranz is here. Hey Alex.

29
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,350
Speaker 8:  I'm your friend who's really upset that their college nickname was stolen

30
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,550
Speaker 8:  by a social media company. It's fine.

31
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,510
Speaker 7:  That was your college nickname. Yeah,

32
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,550
Speaker 8:  It was like, it was a dumb joke when I had to rush sororities. You get

33
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,030
Speaker 8:  tired of introducing yourself. So I'd be like, just call me X it's faster.

34
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,910
Speaker 8:  And it was a terrible joke, but it worked. And then everybody called me X

35
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,350
Speaker 8:  and then people thought I really wanted it. Like, and it wasn't a joke. Oh

36
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:12,510
Speaker 7:  No.

37
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,630
Speaker 8:  Elon and Joy.

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,150
Speaker 7:  Were you super straight edge in college? No,

39
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,790
Speaker 8:  I was in a sorority.

40
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,910
Speaker 7:  Fair enough. David Pierce on vacation this week. Richard Lawler coming back

41
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,230
Speaker 7:  in like a hero to step in. Hey Richard. Hey,

42
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,990
Speaker 9:  I have takes, I also, for a moment there thought that Alex's college nickname

43
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,350
Speaker 9:  was Orchid, which

44
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:29,910
Speaker 7:  Is

45
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,630
Speaker 9:  Gonna be weird, but

46
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,750
Speaker 7:  It's, yeah, for a, for my second year in college, I went by Google Plus.

47
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,230
Speaker 7:  Yeah. No one liked it. It was just a thing that I did. It was my punk rock

48
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:38,470
Speaker 7:  name.

49
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,630
Speaker 8:  Stop stealing our names. Come on guys.

50
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,670
Speaker 7:  All right. A lot to talk about this week. There is the big rebrand from Twitter

51
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,270
Speaker 7:  to X. A number of people have asked me to explain Trademark law, which is

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,590
Speaker 7:  a blessing and a curse really. If you're me. Then there's a huge Samsung

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,550
Speaker 7:  event. The the flip five, the Fold five hit, Allison Johnson's gonna join

54
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,080
Speaker 7:  the show. Talk about that stuff. Bunch of lightning round stuff to get through.

55
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,640
Speaker 7:  And then we asked people for consumer

56
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,480
Speaker 7:  debates last week. We've gotten so many

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,720
Speaker 7:  responses to this. I do want to point out that some people told

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,320
Speaker 7:  us straight out that they have very strong preferences for

59
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,240
Speaker 7:  Windshield washer fluid. I love, I love all of you.

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,960
Speaker 7:  We have some people who go by color. They're, they're very strong proponents

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,200
Speaker 7:  of blue. A lot of people loving Rain X.

62
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,800
Speaker 9:  Oh, rain X has a hive.

63
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,800
Speaker 7:  I didn't know. I didn't know. And we poked that hive

64
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,880
Speaker 7:  and the Rain X people came to us and then at least

65
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,840
Speaker 7:  two people were like, what are you doing? Just use water.

66
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,760
Speaker 8:  What

67
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,760
Speaker 7:  Strident emails from people saying you should just use water. I don't know

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,680
Speaker 7:  what they're talking about because where I live it, it gets cold outside.

69
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,120
Speaker 7:  It it, it won't solve the problem for many months of the year to

70
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,000
Speaker 7:  spray more water onto the snow covered Windshield.

71
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,360
Speaker 8:  Just covering it in sheets of ice every time.

72
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,560
Speaker 7:  Just straight icicles shooting out of the Windshield washers. But yeah, the,

73
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,360
Speaker 7:  the Rain X people very strong. This is a real email we got. Rain

74
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,320
Speaker 7:  X is the only acceptable washer fluid. It is orange.

75
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,880
Speaker 7:  Don't be blue. Your choice is the original or the bug

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,800
Speaker 7:  wash. That is a strident opinion about what, what color it.

77
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,280
Speaker 7:  I'm telling you it's all based on colors. Anyhow, we've got more to come

78
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,000
Speaker 7:  later in the show. We have a massive list of ones people send to us.

79
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,200
Speaker 7:  X versus y I suspect we'll be talking about this for months

80
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,960
Speaker 7:  to come. It's gonna be, it's gonna be pretty good. But let's start with And.

81
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,520
Speaker 7:  I Promise. We'll move through this quickly. The, the weirdest news of the

82
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,280
Speaker 7:  week, which is Elon, sort of flippantly renaming Twitter to

83
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,240
Speaker 7:  X basically by, by tweet Fiat Like. he just tweeted it

84
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,600
Speaker 7:  into existence and then everyone had to pretend it was the plan. Richard

85
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,240
Speaker 7:  even on top of this, tell me what's going on here.

86
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,200
Speaker 9:  It kind of started this weekend. Elon has been talking about rebranding Twitter

87
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,120
Speaker 9:  as ex pretty much since he started to take over, take it over. He made hi

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,960
Speaker 9:  this ex company, its parent company a while ago. And then this weekend

89
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,880
Speaker 9:  he just went ahead and did it. He said, we're X now. He hadn't changed anything.

90
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,400
Speaker 9:  Everything on the site still said Twitter. And even now it still kinda says

91
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,760
Speaker 9:  Twitter all over the place. But he says that they're not tweets anymore.

92
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,920
Speaker 9:  They're, they're X's or I, I don't know. I don't know how you pronounce that.

93
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,680
Speaker 9:  I haven't really gotten that far into it. We've got a logo that is a letter

94
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,760
Speaker 9:  X. It might just be a font. It might have changed a little bit. We don't

95
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,600
Speaker 9:  know. It's gone. It, he changed it back and then he changed it to another

96
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,920
Speaker 9:  thing. It got wider, it got narrower. But this is where we live now. It's

97
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,840
Speaker 9:  X, it's not Twitter. It's it's X. Even though it says Twitter everywhere,

98
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,280
Speaker 7:  It says Twitter everywhere. The domain is still Twitter. No one knows what

99
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,520
Speaker 7:  to call a tweet anymore. There's some argument that you have to call them

100
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,040
Speaker 7:  zits.

101
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,800
Speaker 8:  No, no. That's

102
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,880
Speaker 7:  What the people say. I know

103
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,640
Speaker 8:  I'm a big proponent of calling them all tweets. Even the

104
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,240
Speaker 8:  Threads into the other ones. And I've come around. They're all posts now.

105
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,240
Speaker 8:  Yeah, now the Twitter's dead. They're all posts now. I'm not calling them

106
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,720
Speaker 8:  zits. Don't, don't come at me with that. Well no,

107
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,920
Speaker 7:  Your argument makes more sense now. You can call anything a tweet now because

108
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,240
Speaker 7:  they don't care. But

109
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,160
Speaker 8:  That's like, I dunno, I'm just like having

110
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,280
Speaker 8:  to be like having to differentiate and be like, oh yeah, did you see that

111
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,640
Speaker 8:  thread tweet? Did you see that X?

112
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,880
Speaker 7:  Oh right. Did you see that post? Yeah.

113
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,720
Speaker 8:  Like I'm like, okay, I guess posts it is. You guys wore me down.

114
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,120
Speaker 8:  I'm, I'm like I couldn't hold strong. Yeah. Much like everyone who

115
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,640
Speaker 8:  works at X now, they couldn't stop him.

116
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,760
Speaker 7:  We've talked a lot about how Elon has said he wants Twitter now X to be an

117
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,080
Speaker 7:  everything app along the lines of China's WeChat. That's a big concept to

118
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,560
Speaker 7:  unpack. But I just want to call out Linda Yao, who is the

119
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,520
Speaker 7:  C E O of X. Nominally in charge of this. This company

120
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,200
Speaker 7:  had a tweet thread, an X thread about what she

121
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,560
Speaker 7:  thinks this thing is gonna turn into Alex. I just want you to read it to

122
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,200
Speaker 7:  us. It is incredible.

123
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,720
Speaker 8:  I'm not gonna read the entire thing, but I'm gonna read one of the relevant

124
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,320
Speaker 8:  posts because we're not calling 'em tweets anymore. Yeah, tweets are dead.

125
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,120
Speaker 8:  X is the future state of unlimited interactivity centered in a

126
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,360
Speaker 8:  audio video messaging, payments, banking, creating

127
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,200
Speaker 8:  a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services

128
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,360
Speaker 8:  and opportunities powered by AI X will

129
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,760
Speaker 8:  connect us all in ways. We're just beginning to imagine.

130
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,280
Speaker 7:  Now I understand that Linda was the former head of advertising

131
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,520
Speaker 7:  for N B C Universal. This is ad copy.

132
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,480
Speaker 8:  It's like I think everyone understands she was the former ad

133
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,000
Speaker 7:  Once you're everything, you are nothing. I just, I I I believe in focus

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,560
Speaker 7:  more than anything. What this reminds me of more than anything,

135
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,600
Speaker 7:  I swear to God the first thing I thought of when I read this is the speech

136
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,640
Speaker 7:  that Big Brother gives in apple's 1984 ads where he's

137
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,200
Speaker 7:  like with the information purification directive, we have achieved total

138
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,680
Speaker 7:  world domination. You will be free from the shackles

139
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,440
Speaker 7:  of conflicting thoughts like workers of the world unite.

140
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,400
Speaker 7:  And then the lady throws the hammer through it and they're like, we made

141
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,240
Speaker 7:  the Macintosh. Go watch that ad. Which side of that story

142
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,280
Speaker 7:  do you wanna be on? Like the big brother's side or the lady with

143
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,560
Speaker 7:  the hammer? Like we're the lady with the hammer. That's where The Verge has

144
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,120
Speaker 7:  always lived.

145
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,600
Speaker 8:  I love that they just like announced that they basically want like a,

146
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,640
Speaker 8:  some sort of monopoly. They're like, we are out to build a monopoly for

147
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,120
Speaker 8:  everything and control all things. And it's like well that's actually a bad

148
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:20,520
Speaker 8:  pitch.

149
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Speaker 7:  I mean it's, it's a great pitch if You can pull it off. But this idea that

150
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,680
Speaker 7:  you're gonna start by rebranding the company to X

151
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,920
Speaker 7:  and then you will with somehow with ai. But like you know she's a

152
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,480
Speaker 7:  marketer 'cause she's like powered by ai.

153
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,400
Speaker 8:  That was the best part.

154
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:38,520
Speaker 7:  Like a minute ago she would've been like powered by NFTs X will be the future

155
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,480
Speaker 7:  state of an Eric. Like whatever it is today, five

156
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,520
Speaker 8:  G, five G

157
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,040
Speaker 7:  Tell

158
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,840
Speaker 9:  Me you're a marketing executive without telling me you're a marketing executive.

159
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,680
Speaker 7:  Yes, X is a self-driving car. Like whatever it's

160
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,400
Speaker 7:  centered in audio, video, messaging, payments and you know what's not in

161
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,960
Speaker 7:  there? Is tweets centered in audio?

162
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,160
Speaker 7:  Isn't that messaging? I don't think that's messaging.

163
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,920
Speaker 9:  Whatcha talking about this is the best app to watch the Super Mario Brothers

164
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,600
Speaker 9:  movie on, right? That's, it's that one

165
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,720
Speaker 7:  Just incredible. And Linda will be at the code conference this year. Julie

166
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,680
Speaker 7:  Stein's gonna interview her. That's in September. We're very excited about

167
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,360
Speaker 7:  it. Many questions to ask but you just look at this

168
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,280
Speaker 7:  vision for what they want X to be. And it's funny

169
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,720
Speaker 7:  to make fun of it and it is a lot of marketing but You can see why they're

170
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,360
Speaker 7:  saying this. This is WeChat. Like there are apps like this,

171
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,320
Speaker 7:  super apps all around the world. Facebook pursued a super app model for

172
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,320
Speaker 7:  a long time. They have discovered that in the United States market

173
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,960
Speaker 7:  in particular you need multiple apps. Like you just can't do it

174
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,640
Speaker 7:  the way that You can do it. In China, I think Line is an app like this

175
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,400
Speaker 7:  in Japan. There's other countries where this model works.

176
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,360
Speaker 7:  So you see why you'd say it. You want a messaging app that does payments

177
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,240
Speaker 7:  and banking and hotel reservations and all the other stuff that WeChat

178
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,920
Speaker 7:  can do. It has an extensible plugin architecture. There's actually a long

179
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,000
Speaker 7:  argument that the cell phone market in China is more competitive than

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,120
Speaker 7:  anywhere else because the application layer is in WeChat, right?

181
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,960
Speaker 7:  So it's easier to switch between platforms because then you just download

182
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,840
Speaker 7:  WeChat and run everything in WeChat and it doesn't matter. And You can pick

183
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,120
Speaker 7:  like a camera or a form factor or whatever. 'cause at the end of the day

184
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,440
Speaker 7:  all your apps are running in WeChat. You can feel any way you want about

185
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,920
Speaker 7:  that including that the Chinese government is almost certainly scanning WeChat

186
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,000
Speaker 7:  at all times because it's like an oppressive whatever. But that's the argument,

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,960
Speaker 7:  right? That this exists somewhere at scale and makes them a lot

188
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,760
Speaker 7:  of money and has all kinds of weird downstream effects on on like

189
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,760
Speaker 7:  gadgets. Cool. You have Twitter, you're starting from the

190
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,480
Speaker 7:  base of Twitter, which is so creaky right now. You had to

191
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,360
Speaker 7:  impose rate limits on the a P I and it like kind of doesn't work

192
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,120
Speaker 7:  and it's like full of like weird blue check spam. Elon's doing anti-vax

193
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,800
Speaker 7:  conspiracies like this week he's

194
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,440
Speaker 9:  Having a great time.

195
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,600
Speaker 7:  How are you gonna get from here to there? There's no plan as far as I can

196
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:56,680
Speaker 7:  see.

197
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,040
Speaker 9:  Well I think the first step is that you reveal that your

198
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,200
Speaker 9:  executives will allow people to look into the back end of people's accounts.

199
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,120
Speaker 9:  Pretty much it will. And that's how you're going to get that trust for people

200
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,640
Speaker 9:  to use this as a banking and payments app. Like just to say that we're gonna

201
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,480
Speaker 9:  do the files and we're gonna let people have administrative access and look

202
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,040
Speaker 9:  into accounts just whenever they want to.

203
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,080
Speaker 7:  I mean that's that's true. That's what you want. Again, if your plan is WeChat,

204
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,560
Speaker 7:  you're like how do we do some Chinese government stuff That's like the selling

205
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,480
Speaker 7:  point. Let's, let's begin. So that's that. That's like the broad strokes.

206
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,360
Speaker 7:  I I think that he did it to get attention. I think Elon is a master of getting

207
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,120
Speaker 7:  attention. I also think that he makes all of his Twitter news on the

208
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,280
Speaker 7:  weekends say what you want about him. Like he's obviously not, doesn't give

209
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,200
Speaker 7:  a shit about Twitter Monday through Friday, right? He's like worried

210
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,960
Speaker 7:  about his companies that make money and then like the white wine starts

211
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,840
Speaker 7:  flowing on Friday night and Twitter's plans change by Sunday evening. Like

212
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,440
Speaker 7:  that's the news cycle we're in with pretty, pretty enforced

213
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,600
Speaker 7:  consistency. I think he's good at getting attention. I think that he sees

214
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,200
Speaker 7:  what's happening with Threads. We can talk about Threads in the following

215
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,680
Speaker 7:  feed and stuff they introduced, but he's gotta keep continuously recapturing

216
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,600
Speaker 7:  attention for Twitter 'cause that's the entire game he's in. So I'm gonna

217
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,800
Speaker 7:  change the name to X screw. We're doing it tonight. Send me some logos. It's

218
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,640
Speaker 7:  a great way to capture it. Has kept him in the conversation. Even

219
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,000
Speaker 7:  as Threads rolls out a following feed, I think in a few weeks, federal will

220
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,360
Speaker 7:  out a web app. That's what adversary is saying. By the time Threads rolls

221
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,120
Speaker 7:  out a web app, Elon's gonna be like, it is a self-driving car. Yeah, X is

222
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,360
Speaker 7:  making a self-driving car. I've merged it with Tesla. Like that's just where

223
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,000
Speaker 7:  his brain is to capture attention. I just don't think

224
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,920
Speaker 7:  he's got the capability to do any of this stuff 'cause he fired everybody.

225
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,360
Speaker 8:  He has zero capability to do it and it's like okay,

226
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,920
Speaker 8:  you renamed it, you're capturing attention. Is that attention turning

227
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,480
Speaker 8:  into users and or money

228
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,000
Speaker 9:  As measured by user seconds in the app? Yes. Oh is it

229
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,280
Speaker 9:  the statistic that is so great that absolutely no one other than Elon, Musk

230
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,120
Speaker 9:  uses and no one seems to understand exactly what it is, but judging by that

231
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,920
Speaker 9:  statistic, yes he is winning I mean. I think my big question is can he use

232
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,800
Speaker 9:  that X logo for Twitter? Neil, you know, you, you have to explain this to

233
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,720
Speaker 9:  the people. All right, you

234
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,880
Speaker 8:  Just queue him up. We're

235
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,760
Speaker 9:  Arguing all over the internet. He's got this logo, what is it? Can he actually

236
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,680
Speaker 9:  do that? We're

237
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,560
Speaker 7:  11 minutes in and we're at, we're at IP law. Okay, so I just speed

238
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:13,760
Speaker 8:  Run.

239
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,720
Speaker 7:  This is my, again, this is just what I do. I'm this boulder's going up the

240
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,480
Speaker 7:  hill. Please, I beg you if you're a Vergecast listener, before you type the

241
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,080
Speaker 7:  word copyright, trademark or patent into a text box on the internet, just

242
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,720
Speaker 7:  ask yourself, do I know what this word means? And if it applies to this concept,

243
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,120
Speaker 7:  I, I beg you because this is exhausting. So we talk a lot about copyright

244
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,960
Speaker 7:  law on the show lately because of ai. That's one thing. Then there's trademarks

245
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,920
Speaker 7:  which are for business, right? They signify the origin of goods

246
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,040
Speaker 7:  and services. That's all they're meant to do. You buy a thing, it has the

247
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,600
Speaker 7:  name of a company on it, you know that company exists, you trust them. They're

248
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,800
Speaker 7:  a market tool, right? That and there's lots of rules about it. They're not

249
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,400
Speaker 7:  copyrights. Totally different thing. So I just wanna start there. This is

250
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Speaker 7:  like a whole different world, whole different body of law, whole different

251
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,120
Speaker 7:  set of legal standards. It's just the relationship is like

252
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,120
Speaker 7:  can you own an idea and then people like lose their minds. I just wanna start

253
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,880
Speaker 7:  there. Totally different than copyrights. Totally different than patents.

254
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,440
Speaker 7:  Different standards, different ideas, different whole thing. Okay, so

255
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,160
Speaker 7:  trademarks like many different people can own the same trademark

256
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,320
Speaker 7:  just applied to different goods and services. And the standard

257
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,480
Speaker 7:  is likelihood of confusion. Will people get confused by seeing this

258
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,320
Speaker 7:  stuff? Then there's stuff like distinctiveness is this mark distinctive such

259
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,200
Speaker 7:  that it when in the market, when people see this trademark, they will understand

260
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,320
Speaker 7:  this is coming from you and then not be confused. It might be coming from

261
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,120
Speaker 7:  somewhere else. So X, the letter X is not

262
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,200
Speaker 7:  very distinctive. You have to do a lot of work to make

263
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,240
Speaker 7:  it distinctive in a particular category.

264
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,520
Speaker 8:  Rude to my college. Me though. Yeah

265
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,760
Speaker 7:  Like when you hear the letter X, what you think of is Alex just at a rager

266
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,560
Speaker 7:  in the basement of a sorority house. That's what you should think of. Yeah.

267
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,440
Speaker 7:  Shrugging. Shrugging Everclear out of a Fiji bottle. And if we repeat

268
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,960
Speaker 7:  it enough times we can say you can't use the X

269
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,920
Speaker 7:  trademark. 'cause everyone associates it with that image of Alex Cranz.

270
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,720
Speaker 7:  Let's do it guys. Make it happen. But that's the entire game. Can you make

271
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,600
Speaker 7:  people associate this word or this logo with this company

272
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,280
Speaker 7:  and this product? And once You can You can go get a trademark and there's

273
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,040
Speaker 7:  ways to short circuit that process. You can file what's called like an intent

274
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,440
Speaker 7:  to use application, this whole thing. But that the core idea is, is there

275
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,160
Speaker 7:  an association between this word, image, logo,

276
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,400
Speaker 7:  whatever and this product and company. So Twitter very

277
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,200
Speaker 7:  distinctive from the jump, the logo very distinctive. There's

278
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,720
Speaker 7:  not another thing called Twitter. So they file the trademark for Twitter.

279
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,520
Speaker 7:  They say we have an intent to use it over time they build up a

280
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,360
Speaker 7:  huge amount of equity in the brand such that if you launched anything else

281
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,160
Speaker 7:  named Twitter you would say they would be able to say there's a huge likelihood

282
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,560
Speaker 7:  of confusion. People will think your Twitter product comes from us. Twitter

283
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,840
Speaker 7:  the company. You can't use that trademark. That's the whole game.

284
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,400
Speaker 7:  So X, there's lots of things named X, there's lots of

285
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,920
Speaker 7:  companies named X, there's lots of products named X, famously

286
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,280
Speaker 7:  Elon's, other companies have X's in them. It's great he can

287
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,080
Speaker 7:  use it 'cause no one else can stop him because there is so much latent

288
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,840
Speaker 7:  noise around the letter X. Then Richard, I think what you're getting to

289
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,360
Speaker 7:  is the logo might just be like a Unicode character or the

290
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,840
Speaker 7:  X from a foundry called Monotype. That seems really unclear like

291
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,120
Speaker 7:  Unicode will let him do it. But if it turns out they're actually using the

292
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,760
Speaker 7:  Monotype character, they gotta pay some licensing fees. That's just money.

293
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,880
Speaker 7:  That's fine. You can solve that problem. It might be a lot of licensing fees.

294
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,240
Speaker 7:  That might be a huge mistake for a company like Twitter that's in trouble.

295
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,160
Speaker 7:  But it's a money problem. It's not like a legal problem. Then there's the

296
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,880
Speaker 7:  last piece of it. Whichever one has like gotten completely wrong in just

297
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,840
Speaker 7:  horrific ways is that meta and Microsoft have

298
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,560
Speaker 7:  trademarks on things with X's in them as they relate to social

299
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,600
Speaker 7:  networking. And so when you file for a trademark, you have to say what the

300
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,120
Speaker 7:  trademark is for. So I could file for a trademark on the letter X

301
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,360
Speaker 7:  as it relates to selling fruit by the roadside and it would've nothing

302
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,600
Speaker 7:  to do with the trademark for X as it relates to social networking. So you

303
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,480
Speaker 7:  go and you list a class of what you wanna do with a trademark. So You

304
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,240
Speaker 7:  can get definition in the market. This is gonna relate this to that. So if

305
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,120
Speaker 7:  you very famously, the Apple logo on the side of N

306
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,120
Speaker 7:  Y C taxis, the city of New York and Apple had to define the class

307
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,760
Speaker 7:  they to negotiate to say this logo is about taxis

308
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,680
Speaker 7:  and like taxis being eco-friendly and not about Apple. The computers

309
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,560
Speaker 7:  fine. It's a negotiation, but you just make the definition, you move on your

310
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,400
Speaker 7:  way. Here. Microsoft had one for Mixer that was just,

311
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,360
Speaker 7:  it's the logo X. So they trademarked the logo, the

312
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,240
Speaker 7:  drawing, and if you use that drawing or anything that looks substantially

313
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,120
Speaker 7:  like that drawing, you get in trouble. But they're not using that drawing.

314
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,240
Speaker 7:  So it doesn't matter. Then if you'll remember, Microsoft launched Mixer,

315
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,240
Speaker 7:  remember they pulled Ninja over, tried to get everyone off of Twitch. Mixer

316
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
Speaker 7:  failed Ninja went back to Twitch, Microsoft divested this whole thing to

317
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,800
Speaker 7:  Facebook gaming and assigned this logo to Facebook as part of that deal.

318
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,360
Speaker 7:  So now Meta owns this logo as it relates to social networking, but it's just

319
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,120
Speaker 7:  the logo, it's not the letter X, it's the drawing, not the letter. Meta

320
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,520
Speaker 7:  owns another thing called X, it doesn't matter 'cause they're just logos.

321
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,200
Speaker 7:  So everyone's getting confused about the letter X and what it

322
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,120
Speaker 7:  protects and it's really nothing like at the end of the day it's, he's

323
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,760
Speaker 7:  not gonna use those logos. No one's gonna confuse this X logo for that logo.

324
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,800
Speaker 7:  And so many people are already using the letter X for everything else that

325
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,720
Speaker 7:  his problem is actually making anyone associate the letter X

326
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,840
Speaker 7:  with the thing that used to be Twitter as opposed to all of the other things

327
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,120
Speaker 7:  that are named X. Right? Which is probably a bigger problem than his legal

328
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:35,680
Speaker 7:  challenges.

329
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,720
Speaker 8:  So this is why the Twitter Japanese account is just called

330
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,000
Speaker 8:  Japan currently instead of Xan because Xan is

331
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Speaker 8:  the name of one of the most famous bands in Japanese history.

332
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,560
Speaker 7:  So I, I've seen people report on this. I do not know enough about Japanese

333
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,680
Speaker 7:  trademark law.

334
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,920
Speaker 8:  They definitely haven't called Japan. So

335
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,000
Speaker 8:  I I I think there's still a lot of confusion there, but I know the ex Japan

336
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,960
Speaker 8:  like lead composer was Like, he can't call it Xan.

337
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,640
Speaker 8:  That's the name of our band. I'm looking into it. And I think that's kind

338
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,360
Speaker 8:  of where we're at. And Twitter notably is not calling Twitter

339
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,560
Speaker 8:  Japan Xan anymore, they're just calling it

340
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:15,560
Speaker 8:  Japan.

341
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,840
Speaker 7:  So, but there's a huge difference in Twitter handles and trademarks,

342
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,280
Speaker 7:  right,

343
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,800
Speaker 8:  Right, right.

344
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,240
Speaker 7:  Xan, the band might have a trademark in Japan for the name of its band,

345
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,920
Speaker 7:  but that's for the name of a band, right? I don't know if they have a trademark

346
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,920
Speaker 7:  on social networking company like You can probably start a company in Japan

347
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,880
Speaker 7:  called Xan because it won't be the band. This, and this is the thing that

348
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,720
Speaker 7:  everyone gets confused with the trademark law. Like you it, as long as people

349
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,200
Speaker 7:  aren't confused that one thing is the other. Like usually trademark callouts,

350
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,520
Speaker 7:  you have the same name for two things.

351
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:45,840
Speaker 8:  Could you?

352
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:46,640
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

353
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,480
Speaker 8:  Of course You can. Like if I went and started a car company called D M X,

354
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,160
Speaker 8:  I feel like someone's estate would probably have something to say to me.

355
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,640
Speaker 7:  You could definitely start, I, I don't know if D M X has a trademark registration

356
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,600
Speaker 7:  for D M X cars. Like that's the, the trademark

357
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,640
Speaker 7:  law is just not like copyright law. Okay. It's not the same thing where like

358
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,440
Speaker 7:  any copy gets you in trouble. Yeah, it's like narrowly if you

359
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,240
Speaker 7:  start D M X cars, I love that we're using this example. Yeah,

360
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,160
Speaker 7:  if you start D M X cars and like you have nothing to do with D M

361
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,800
Speaker 7:  X, you don't trade on any of his likeness and You don't use his lyrics and

362
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,640
Speaker 7:  it's totally different and you say this is distinctive and he doesn't have

363
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,960
Speaker 7:  a trademark registration in cars. You can probably do it. You should talk

364
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,360
Speaker 7:  to a lawyer. I'm not giving you this legal, I don't think you should start

365
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,200
Speaker 7:  D M X cars more hassle than it's worth. So your

366
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,800
Speaker 9:  Legal advice as my lawyer is that I can start D M X cars. I just can't use

367
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,640
Speaker 9:  the tagline. It's dark and held is hot.

368
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,200
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think that's bad. Like you'll get in trouble. Like the standard is

369
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,960
Speaker 7:  likelihood of confusion. Is it likely that by using the name

370
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,320
Speaker 7:  D M X cars people will be confused that D M X has anything to do with it?

371
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,680
Speaker 7:  I don't know the answer to that question. I don't think anyone should find

372
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,600
Speaker 7:  out the answer to that question. I'm just telling you what the standard is.

373
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,880
Speaker 7:  So if you're in Japan, And, I, dunno what the standard in, in Japanese trademark

374
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,760
Speaker 7:  law is. I'm just telling you that it is almost certain that You can start

375
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,560
Speaker 7:  a company called X Japan because people will not confuse the company for

376
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,040
Speaker 7:  the band. Right. I do not think that has any

377
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,880
Speaker 7:  relationship at all to Twitter handles. If they

378
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,360
Speaker 7:  wanted to take the Xan Twitter handle they could

379
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,200
Speaker 7:  because it belongs to them. And we know that they think this because they

380
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,080
Speaker 7:  just took the X Twitter handle from some guy and the guy

381
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,040
Speaker 7:  was like, that sucks. And he's not a world famous band and so

382
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Speaker 7:  they're not in trouble. But

383
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,080
Speaker 8:  They couldn't have taken it like they, if they had taken it from the Xan

384
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,200
Speaker 8:  band, they just would've looked like Monster Jackass.

385
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,120
Speaker 7:  Even more worse monsters than they are. Yeah. Like, you know, like I don't,

386
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,680
Speaker 7:  I I think that's what's stopping them, not Yeah, the law, the trademark love

387
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,880
Speaker 7:  of Japan. It's their platform. They can take any handle they want and there's

388
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,520
Speaker 7:  really no relationship between the handles and the trademark law.

389
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,840
Speaker 7:  There. There's like some minor relationship, like the platforms

390
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,920
Speaker 7:  will respect Trademark law to keep, to keep impersonation off their

391
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,480
Speaker 7:  platforms. Like if someone shows up and makes a Verge handle and starts

392
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,920
Speaker 7:  tweeting and it looks like us, like we show up to the platform and say,

393
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,160
Speaker 7:  this is our trademark that's impersonation. Like make it go away. Twitter

394
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,160
Speaker 7:  notably a lot looser on the impersonation situation

395
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,480
Speaker 7:  than it used to be. so like I, I just think like everyone's getting

396
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,400
Speaker 7:  these concepts like fairly mushy and confused that the

397
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,760
Speaker 7:  handles in the actual trademarks, no relationship really whatsoever

398
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,480
Speaker 7:  unless Twitter decides there should be a relationship. And then the trademark

399
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,240
Speaker 7:  laws of different countries are slightly different, but all of them are

400
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,040
Speaker 7:  pretty focused on, you're in the supermarket, you look at the label,

401
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,000
Speaker 7:  you see Kellogg's and you know that that is actually from Kellogg's and you

402
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,080
Speaker 7:  have relationship and that's market information You can trade on. And if

403
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,920
Speaker 7:  you go outta the supermarket and you go to a cloning store and

404
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,560
Speaker 7:  you see t-shirts made by another company called Kellogg with a

405
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,480
Speaker 7:  radically different logo and it's a radically different product, you're not

406
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,160
Speaker 7:  gonna associate with Serial Maker. And so both of those companies can have

407
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,760
Speaker 7:  those names fine. Like that. That's basically fine.

408
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,240
Speaker 7:  And I think that's the situation Elon is in and everyone just wants to find

409
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,000
Speaker 7:  a gotcha. But the gotcha here is that it's a shit name that means nothing.

410
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,320
Speaker 7:  Like the market will handle this problem.

411
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,920
Speaker 8:  Here's my next question. He, he, he, they're famously using something that

412
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,880
Speaker 8:  looks a lot like a very specific Unicode for

413
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,880
Speaker 8:  X, like a Unicode symbol for X. Generally speaking,

414
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,400
Speaker 8:  you get yelled at if you use somebody's logo in like your name or something

415
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,360
Speaker 8:  like that because it's their logo. How does that work if I

416
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,880
Speaker 8:  decide to use that X as the end of like my name, just,

417
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,920
Speaker 8:  I wouldn't ever do that because that's dumb. Oh, like

418
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,080
Speaker 7:  The Unicode X? Yeah.

419
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,680
Speaker 8:  If I use that same Unicode X, if it starts being comes

420
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,360
Speaker 8:  associated with this other thing, even though it's like openly licensed and

421
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,240
Speaker 8:  theoretically anyone can use it. If they copyright it

422
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,720
Speaker 8:  specifically, if they like copyright that logo specifically for them. What

423
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,800
Speaker 8:  happens if we start using that Unicode or does the u Unicode? You're killing

424
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,440
Speaker 8:  me X have to get

425
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,360
Speaker 7:  Rid of that. They trademark, they trademark the Oh

426
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,680
Speaker 8:  My gosh. So

427
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,800
Speaker 7:  Confusing. This is the thing. It's driving me bonkers. Yeah. Imagine being

428
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,720
Speaker 7:  me on a plane just freaking out 35,000 feet

429
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,960
Speaker 7:  while this is going down.

430
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,160
Speaker 8:  So can I use the X or am I like Yeah, I can use it anytime. Of course

431
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,320
Speaker 8:  You can.

432
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,200
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Like they can't stop unless you're holding yourself out as x

433
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,600
Speaker 7:  the company, they're not gonna be able to stop you. They can, they can send

434
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,280
Speaker 7:  you letters. Well, the fame, my my favorite letter that we ever got, Richard,

435
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,800
Speaker 7:  I don't even remember this. We used to run a site called Eng Gadget Mobile.

436
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,600
Speaker 7:  It was pink. So Eng Gadget was Blue Eng Gadget Mobile

437
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,240
Speaker 7:  was pink. What was Eng Gadget hd Richard, that was yours. Gray. I think it

438
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,960
Speaker 7:  was gray. And so it was hot pink and T-Mobile when they started using

439
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,760
Speaker 7:  Magento a lot sent us a letter that was like, we own the shade of pink. And

440
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,600
Speaker 7:  we're like, no you don't bro. Also we're gonna publish this

441
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,840
Speaker 7:  letter. And then we, and like Ryan Block and Peter Rojas published the letter

442
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,200
Speaker 7:  and then they were like, oh, that was really stupid. Our lawyers will never

443
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,360
Speaker 7:  do that again. And that was the end of it. And that's like how it goes.

444
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,360
Speaker 8:  So we can all use the X anytime we want. The one, the Unicode X,

445
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,920
Speaker 7:  There's not a situation in which you typing a letter

446
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,520
Speaker 7:  implicates their trademark.

447
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,640
Speaker 8:  Right. But if I like use it as part of my name on a

448
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,480
Speaker 8:  whole bunch of different social media apps, like I start using, 'cause You

449
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,200
Speaker 8:  can use, you know, Unicode symbols in a lot of different ones. Yeah. They

450
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,000
Speaker 8:  all print it. And, I start using that X could they eventually come after

451
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,640
Speaker 8:  me being like, stop it. Like if you started using the Netflix

452
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,520
Speaker 8:  Inn for your first name for some reason that was in Unicode and you

453
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,320
Speaker 8:  started using that all the time, wouldn't Netflix eventually be like,

454
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,680
Speaker 8:  Hey, stop.

455
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,880
Speaker 7:  I don't know why the Netflix Inn would be in Unicode. It would just be the

456
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,200
Speaker 7:  letter N Hypothetical,

457
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,000
Speaker 8:  Hypothetical. Not everyone takes their logos from Unicode

458
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,760
Speaker 8:  because that seems deeply

459
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,160
Speaker 7:  Stupid, right? This, I guess you, you've now landed on the answer to your

460
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,280
Speaker 7:  question. Yeah. The Unicode X is just X you know how

461
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,000
Speaker 7:  like emojis are not standardized, they're just Unicode and you, they're meant

462
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,760
Speaker 7:  to represent something like Yeah, right car and then like Samsung

463
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,480
Speaker 7:  and Apple have different cars. Unicode just represents letters. Like

464
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,440
Speaker 7:  here's a character and then your typeface on your computer. Your font

465
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,560
Speaker 7:  is like, okay, that's an A I'm gonna represent this. A it's, there's not

466
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,400
Speaker 7:  like a Unicode font. So this X that they're pulling from that's in

467
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,480
Speaker 7:  Unicode, You can render it in any font you want.

468
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,360
Speaker 7:  It just ha it's just because of the, the way the lines work. It looks

469
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,160
Speaker 7:  like a thing. Yeah, but it's just a, you know, I mean, it's like literally

470
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,680
Speaker 7:  a series of numbers that say to a computer, make this character

471
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,880
Speaker 7:  and then between that instruction and you is the computer saying, okay,

472
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,600
Speaker 7:  in this font,

473
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,520
Speaker 8:  Okay, it just happens to look like the logo

474
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,960
Speaker 8:  of this company that will presumably be trademarked at some point.

475
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,080
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think it will be very difficult for them. Like, especially if

476
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,950
Speaker 7:  the design is, if they were just like, the letter A

477
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,310
Speaker 7:  conceptually is our trademark. That's this X as it relates to

478
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:52,430
Speaker 7:  Unicode, right? Yeah. so like who, who the hell knows it? It is remarkable.

479
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,950
Speaker 7:  And I know we're gonna get emails about this. People are gonna say, you're

480
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,310
Speaker 7:  like, we are spending so much time talking about this dumb thing. It's so

481
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,310
Speaker 7:  dumb. And it's one i i am a sucker for

482
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,990
Speaker 7:  a trademark law conversation. So here we are, welcome to our show. This has

483
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,590
Speaker 7:  always Happens. Two, this is the dismantling

484
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,750
Speaker 7:  of what was one of the most influential

485
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,390
Speaker 7:  information networks that has ever existed. And so you, you have to

486
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,310
Speaker 7:  talk about it because what Twitter meant, like what the word Twitter

487
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,990
Speaker 7:  meant to make this about trademark law, what that word meant, what the word

488
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,070
Speaker 7:  tweet meant to people conveyed so much. Meaning

489
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,060
Speaker 7:  this celebrity tweeted an apology. You already know

490
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,220
Speaker 7:  the whole story. I don't even need to say a celebrity, I don't need to say

491
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,260
Speaker 7:  what the apology was about. I don't need to tell you that. It was a screenshot

492
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,700
Speaker 7:  of notes sap, right? Like the meaning was Im the word was

493
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,660
Speaker 7:  imbued with meaning that had emotional resonance throughout the culture that

494
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,180
Speaker 7:  has been dismantled. And it is, it is worth discussing

495
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,220
Speaker 7:  why that is happening and to what end And I think the end is, is

496
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,540
Speaker 7:  nonsensical, right? It's an audio video platform that will enable banking

497
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,260
Speaker 7:  and put AI in your bones or whatever the hell it's gonna do. But the thing

498
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,060
Speaker 7:  itself was important if it gets there. But yeah, the, the

499
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,020
Speaker 7:  people freaking out about trademark law is like at Eng Gadget, I wrote so

500
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,380
Speaker 7:  many of these stories that I just had the, the middle part of it and a text

501
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,220
Speaker 7:  expander, you know, I was just like t m l

502
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,860
Speaker 7:  and it would just like spit out 150 words of trademark law explainer.

503
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,340
Speaker 8:  Emma's gonna ask for that tip. Like she's gonna be like, you still got that

504
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,340
Speaker 8:  boiler? Play it for me.

505
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,700
Speaker 7:  I did it. you know, in Apple versus Samsung time, I wrote so many patent

506
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,220
Speaker 7:  loss stories that we're effectively just explainers about how patents work,

507
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,940
Speaker 7:  which we won't do here, but we're just in that time when the idea of like

508
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,780
Speaker 7:  how to own an idea is very complicated because that's all the internet

509
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,540
Speaker 7:  is. There's a bunch of people sort of ephemerally sending ideas around without

510
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,420
Speaker 7:  any like, limits on scarcity. And that just like the,

511
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,340
Speaker 7:  the AI copyright conversation is like a big deal here in Trademark Law.

512
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,900
Speaker 7:  It's like people search the trademark database and they're like, meta already

513
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:58,940
Speaker 7:  owns X and it's like, okay, let's step back to figure out what trademarks

514
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,660
Speaker 7:  are even for, right? And then you just have to start at the

515
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,700
Speaker 9:  Start. And that brings us to now where we've got all these things. He's sort

516
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,820
Speaker 9:  of changed the name. He has, he has mostly changed. The name has changed

517
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,820
Speaker 9:  on Android, but not on iOS as I'm speaking. Maybe by the time you hear this,

518
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,500
Speaker 9:  it will have changed in the iOS app, Twitter has tried to push

519
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,020
Speaker 9:  businesses into buying more ads so they can stay, or I'm sorry, X has tried

520
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,500
Speaker 9:  to push businesses into buying more ads so they can stay verified. We had

521
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,020
Speaker 9:  Esther Crawford characters coming back from past seasons

522
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,420
Speaker 9:  suddenly pop up talking about what it was like to work at Twitter until she

523
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,180
Speaker 9:  was fired and sleeping on the floor. And how Elon listens to

524
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,660
Speaker 9:  whoever just happens to be around and takes random ideas. Is there, is there

525
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,700
Speaker 9:  anything else we haven't discussed?

526
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,340
Speaker 7:  The one thing I wanna point out is Threads rolled out its following feed

527
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,060
Speaker 7:  this week. Great, it's cool. It immediately showcases how little

528
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,440
Speaker 7:  volume there is on Threads. Like I've got a lot of people on Threads. Everyone's

529
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,000
Speaker 7:  still posting on Twitter, so that hasn't happened yet. I think it won't happen

530
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,280
Speaker 7:  until they roll out the web version, which both Zuckerberg and Adversary

531
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,480
Speaker 7:  have said they're gonna do Emery in response to Casey

532
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,120
Speaker 7:  Zuckerberg in response to Lauren Goode. So Verge alumni network

533
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,480
Speaker 7:  out there getting us what we need. But if you don't have the web version,

534
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,000
Speaker 7:  it's, it's very hard for true posters to keep up the pace. So I think that's

535
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,760
Speaker 7:  like coming, but you can't leave the app stuck in the

536
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,560
Speaker 7:  following feed. It's not a sticky preference. It defaults you. If your app

537
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,440
Speaker 7:  gets pushed outta memory or reboots in any way, or even it seems like just

538
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,360
Speaker 7:  whenever it feels like it, it'll drop you back into the algorithmic feed,

539
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,720
Speaker 7:  which is just a pure pain in the ass. And they should just make that setting

540
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,560
Speaker 7:  sticky. And that's just respecting user preferences. Like I don't, I don't

541
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,880
Speaker 7:  feel like I'm being a diva about this. It's like I set the preference, leave

542
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,360
Speaker 7:  it alone. Like my car is not like I've moved the seat around to what I think

543
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,800
Speaker 7:  will be more appropriate for you. It's like, just leave it. It seems very

544
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,560
Speaker 7:  simple to me. It's

545
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,320
Speaker 10:  A real clippy move.

546
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:43,240
Speaker 7:  It's a real, it sounds, it seems like you, what you want is the Nugget account.

547
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,640
Speaker 7:  Like, here it is again. All right, we should take a break. That's, that's

548
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,240
Speaker 7:  been a lot of x talk. Again, if you're, if you're mad at us, I'm just telling

549
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,680
Speaker 7:  you Twitter was massively important. I'm very excited

550
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,880
Speaker 7:  about the reset moment of the internet. If you listen to other episodes of

551
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,040
Speaker 7:  show, you know, I think there's a reset moment on the internet. I think search

552
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,240
Speaker 7:  and ai Sunar Phai this week said the search generative experience

553
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,920
Speaker 7:  is the future of search. That's the clearest and most crisply he has said

554
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,400
Speaker 7:  that that's a big deal. We're in a moment of reset for the internet.

555
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,360
Speaker 7:  Taking a second to talk about the thing that was before you

556
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,320
Speaker 7:  go onto the next thing. I think it's, I think it's fine. Also, You can just

00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,820
Speaker 7:  We're back. Allison Johnson has joined us. Hey Allison. Hello Big Samsung

594
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,940
Speaker 7:  event this week. Lots of noise around the Samsung event. Samsung's

595
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,900
Speaker 7:  finances are in disarray. They had earnings as well.

596
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:50,060
Speaker 7:  Profits are down. There's some data I saw that said iPhone sales in South Korea

597
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,980
Speaker 7:  are up, which is weird, not great to lose in your home turf,

598
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,780
Speaker 7:  but the phones look good, right? It's the, the flip five and the Fold five,

599
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,660
Speaker 7:  the launch, it Unpacked what's going on here?

600
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,580
Speaker 13:  Yeah, the, I guess the big story is that they Fold flat now,

601
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,700
Speaker 13:  so yeah, we got got a new flip style and Fold

602
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,380
Speaker 13:  style phone. They finally figured out how to make the, the

603
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,860
Speaker 13:  hinges Fold totally flat. And the flip five is really,

604
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,940
Speaker 13:  is the one I'm most excited about. I think it, it's the more

605
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,860
Speaker 13:  interesting kind of update of the two. It comes with a

606
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,940
Speaker 13:  much bigger, like still small, but a lot bigger cover screen.

607
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,740
Speaker 13:  It's 3.6 inches now, which is just gonna

608
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:34,700
Speaker 13:  totally change what You can do with the phone as opposed to the like

609
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,620
Speaker 13:  really tiny screen on the flip floor. So that, that's a big

610
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,620
Speaker 13:  story I think.

611
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,180
Speaker 8:  Was it really that tiny? The previous

612
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,220
Speaker 13:  One? It was tiny. Yeah, because one of the cool things is You can like

613
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,500
Speaker 13:  frame a selfie and use the rear facing cameras and get a preview.

614
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,180
Speaker 13:  I held up a postage stamp to the, the preview you get, it's

615
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,780
Speaker 13:  the exact same size as a postage stamp. It's like So

616
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,500
Speaker 13:  Hard to see yourself.

617
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,460
Speaker 8:  Okay, nevermind. That is tiny.

618
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,540
Speaker 13:  Yeah. Yeah. Like the screen itself was bigger than a postage stamp, but

619
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,300
Speaker 13:  in it like not even

620
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,140
Speaker 8:  A good postage stamp. The little ones

621
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,460
Speaker 13:  Not even the like forever stamps like yeah, the old school

622
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,020
Speaker 13:  ones with no barcode. But yeah, the Fold five is

623
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:19,100
Speaker 13:  like an extremely minor update aside from the hinge

624
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,020
Speaker 13:  thing, which is exciting. But that's, that's even saying a lot I mean the

625
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,860
Speaker 8:  HCH thing is exciting though, right? Like, like this is

626
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,740
Speaker 8:  a big deal 'cause everybody, was it a couple weeks ago Pixel we got the with

627
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,420
Speaker 8:  a Pixel Fold and oh my God, it's so flat and, and it was like, well we're

628
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,080
Speaker 8:  certainly gonna get this. And we did and these, but Samsung's been doing

629
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,760
Speaker 8:  this a lot longer. They've got a lot more other stuff that's polished Yeah.

630
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,600
Speaker 8:  In that way. Like you haven't gotten ahold of it yet, right?

631
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,000
Speaker 13:  I am awaiting my review units. No, they

632
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,440
Speaker 13:  were supposed to be here yesterday and we're having conversations.

633
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,480
Speaker 13:  I should get phones tomorrow. I'm anxiously awaiting, but

634
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,240
Speaker 8:  You're ex like pumped. You're kind of excited to like check it out and like

635
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,800
Speaker 8:  see how this works when it's flat and made by someone who's been doing this

636
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,040
Speaker 8:  a while.

637
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,600
Speaker 13:  Yeah. Yeah, that's the thing. I mean like the Pixel Fold

638
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,520
Speaker 13:  really like the form factor and really like, thought it folds flat,

639
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,120
Speaker 13:  but when I was using it, I just kind of kept having these feelings of like,

640
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,400
Speaker 13:  oh, well Samsung is like doing this a little better. You can, there's more

641
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,920
Speaker 13:  multitasking. There's just more customization

642
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,120
Speaker 13:  and you definitely just get the feeling like Samsung is way ahead

643
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,560
Speaker 13:  and foldable. So when they do make that little upgrade, it's just

644
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,360
Speaker 13:  kind of like putting a stamp on something that was already

645
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,200
Speaker 13:  pretty good. Yeah, so it is exciting if, well like the,

646
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,000
Speaker 13:  a little boring

647
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,760
Speaker 7:  Samsung just isn't constrained by having to run Android. Like

648
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,920
Speaker 7:  their ability to just mess with the software to support

649
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:52,520
Speaker 7:  folding is just Google has to do it for everybody, right?

650
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,400
Speaker 7:  You can see Google's like very careful. They're trying to like make standards,

651
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:00,240
Speaker 7:  make it universal so that anybody makes a folding phone, kind of gets it

652
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,200
Speaker 7:  for free. That's their job, I think is the OS vendor. Like

653
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Speaker 7:  that's, they have to, Samsung's just like, I don't know, Bixie is gonna make

654
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,120
Speaker 7:  the app bigger. Like they just don't have to give a shit. And so they, I

655
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,720
Speaker 7:  think they're able to experiment more or iterate faster that just watching

656
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,240
Speaker 7:  the, like the little bit of the keynotes that I've been able to see, they,

657
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,160
Speaker 7:  they're just able to take bigger risks with like, what does it mean for the

658
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,880
Speaker 7:  screen to get bigger?

659
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,720
Speaker 9:  So Samsung can force Instagram into making an app that fills up the whole

660
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,960
Speaker 9:  screen and Google can't,

661
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,320
Speaker 13:  Or they'll, they'll put the option to make it bigger or

662
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,280
Speaker 13:  run to Instagram side by side. you know, like somewhere in the,

663
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,040
Speaker 13:  in deep in the menu settings, they're, they're happy to put something in

664
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,480
Speaker 13:  the menu settings for you to do what you want.

665
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,040
Speaker 7:  Why are you more excited about the flip?

666
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,560
Speaker 13:  I maybe just coming off of the Razor plus the Motorola Razor Plus,

667
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,440
Speaker 13:  which has the really big cover screen, it was kind of a light bulb for me.

668
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,720
Speaker 13:  It, it felt like, oh, I finally get what these flip style

669
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,640
Speaker 13:  phones can do. Just with being able to interact more with the front screen.

670
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,080
Speaker 13:  You can write texts on it, which you couldn't do before

671
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:10,360
Speaker 13:  with the smaller cover screen. You can go into the settings and let

672
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,200
Speaker 13:  it run full apps for you, which is like, not generally

673
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,000
Speaker 13:  recommended, but if you're a sicko, if you're a sicko like me,

674
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,240
Speaker 13:  you could do that. And then that's where I was just having a lot of fun,

675
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,960
Speaker 13:  like finding things like You can run Google

676
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:28,960
Speaker 13:  Translate on it and it's, it's not a super experience,

677
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,920
Speaker 13:  but I can like type in a word in Spanish and just get

678
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,880
Speaker 13:  a translation without like doing a whole thing on my phone. So

679
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,960
Speaker 13:  I'm, I'm excited to see what Samsung's take on this is

680
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,160
Speaker 13:  and if they're, I have a hunch that like their

681
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,720
Speaker 13:  software is gonna be ahead of Motorolas here,

682
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,760
Speaker 13:  but I, I don't know, I'm, I'm just excited to check 'em out side by side.

683
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,920
Speaker 13:  Are you gonna watch the Oppenheimer trailer on it?

684
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,800
Speaker 13:  I guess so. I, I haven't watched it at all. So

685
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,720
Speaker 13:  see how big it's, I'll flip it open and watch Barbie after that.

686
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,760
Speaker 13:  There you go

687
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,280
Speaker 7:  As Christopher Nolan intended. It's funny. So you're saying like

688
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,720
Speaker 7:  the, it's a light bulb moment with the Motorola one and now the Samsung one

689
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:19,280
Speaker 7:  isn't that just having a phone, like the whole point of the flip

690
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:23,360
Speaker 7:  phone factor to me was like, I will close this and my

691
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,080
Speaker 7:  phone will go away and now you're like, okay, they solved it by putting

692
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,080
Speaker 7:  a giant screen on it. And I can use my phone without opening

693
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,400
Speaker 7:  my, I I have to be missing something.

694
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,440
Speaker 13:  That's a fair point. But here's the thing. So I've been, I've been wearing

695
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,120
Speaker 13:  a smartwatch Yeah. Cutting edge technology here and

696
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:45,440
Speaker 13:  there. I'm just finding there's like a middle ground between stuff I can

697
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,120
Speaker 13:  do on my smartwatch where I just like, I just wanna see a text and like

698
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,840
Speaker 13:  dismiss it and then there's the things you want your full phone for

699
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,880
Speaker 13:  and then the cover screen is like in between these two things

700
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,720
Speaker 13:  where I can't like Google translate a word on the

701
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Speaker 13:  smartwatch or I can talk to Siri, And I, I don't know. I don't wanna do

702
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,680
Speaker 13:  that. So that's where I was finding it was really interesting and

703
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,520
Speaker 13:  helpful. And I think, I think more of those

704
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,440
Speaker 13:  kind of use cases will emerge. It did have the effect of like,

705
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,520
Speaker 13:  you don't get sucked into scrolling Instagram on your phone because

706
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,160
Speaker 13:  it is just terrible. Like You can

707
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,040
Speaker 13:  tap on, You can tap on the Instagram notification and just mindlessly

708
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,000
Speaker 13:  you'll start like looking through stuff and you realize like, this is awful.

709
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,880
Speaker 13:  I either need to stop or open the phone. So that's where I was like,

710
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,280
Speaker 13:  aha.

711
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,040
Speaker 7:  Were you having moments of like, I am not going to open this phone. I will

712
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,720
Speaker 7:  feel guilty if I open the phone. I did.

713
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,800
Speaker 13:  Yeah. I mean I had plenty of moments where I was like, yeah, I'm gonna

714
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,360
Speaker 13:  go for it.

715
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,880
Speaker 13:  Gonna just dive right into the Instagram feed. But

716
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,240
Speaker 7:  H how is Samsung software at switching you from that little screen to the

717
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,680
Speaker 7:  big screen? Because that's been, like, these phones are effectively mid-range

718
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,320
Speaker 7:  phones, right? That it feels like the, the seamlessness of

719
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,240
Speaker 7:  moving between modes has been held back by the

720
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,160
Speaker 7:  sort of mid-range Qualcomm chips in them.

721
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,640
Speaker 13:  Yeah. And Samsung's a little further ahead here too. They have the eight

722
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,680
Speaker 13:  gen two in this one, which is has been very good in all the phones

723
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,320
Speaker 13:  I've tested. Yeah, I think they're still figuring out what do you, what

724
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,200
Speaker 13:  do people want when they, when you close the phone, do you wanna

725
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,880
Speaker 13:  keep running the app that you were running? Should, should it prompt you

726
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,600
Speaker 13:  to open the app? Motorola has a setting

727
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,440
Speaker 13:  where you'll just get a little icon on the cover screen

728
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,040
Speaker 13:  when you're using an app on the big screen. You close it, it'll kind of

729
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,840
Speaker 13:  be like, tap this to keep running on the outer screen, which I thought was

730
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,640
Speaker 13:  clever and pretty useful and You can ignore it if you don't wanna do that.

731
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,880
Speaker 13:  So I think they're still figuring it out and it's definitely

732
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,440
Speaker 13:  different kind of, you know, app by app. Yeah. So

733
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,880
Speaker 13:  we'll see what Samsung thinks.

734
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,400
Speaker 7:  And then the, the difference with the Fold five is that

735
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,120
Speaker 7:  it really is just a phone on the front, right? And then you like open it

736
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,480
Speaker 7:  and you Yeah. And then you have a tablet. Is there any relationship between

737
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,240
Speaker 7:  sort of like, it's a phone and it switch goes down to a widget

738
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,400
Speaker 7:  on the flip and it's a phone and it opens to a tablet

739
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,640
Speaker 7:  on the Fold. Like those are two wildly different paradigms, but it seems

740
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,240
Speaker 7:  like they share some like conceptual behaviors.

741
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,200
Speaker 13:  Yeah, I think they are really kind of splitting a little more now.

742
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,600
Speaker 13:  Like the Fold format feels like if you want

743
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:32,960
Speaker 13:  Phone plus Yeah. Rather than like a little

744
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,840
Speaker 13:  bit less phone. Then you want the the tablet one I mean our, our

745
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,640
Speaker 13:  good friend Dan Seaford will recommend a full

746
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,400
Speaker 13:  tablet style for you. That's how he watches Oppenheimer actually.

747
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,360
Speaker 13:  That's his favorite way to watch every movie, I guess.

748
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,680
Speaker 13:  Yeah, haunts me

749
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:55,200
Speaker 13:  That he does that with Instagram running on the side. Yeah, it, it's, I

750
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,920
Speaker 13:  see the appeal And I, I appreciate it for stuff that

751
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,320
Speaker 13:  I'm like sitting on the couch using the phone, you know, closed And.

752
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,960
Speaker 13:  I'm like, oh, I need to do this thing that I would normally

753
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,960
Speaker 13:  go get my laptop for. Like, I need to make an Amazon fresh

754
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,840
Speaker 13:  order and it's just like obnoxious to do it on a small screen. Yeah, those

755
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,600
Speaker 13:  moments where you're like, I either I need to put this phone down and go

756
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,400
Speaker 13:  get my laptop, that's when you Fold it open and you're like, no, I

757
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,120
Speaker 13:  can, I can run two things on the same screen. I can have,

758
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,400
Speaker 13:  I don't need to be like tabbing between apps. I can, I can figure out

759
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,400
Speaker 13:  where I'm gonna have lunch, you know, and Google Maps and read the restaurant

760
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,200
Speaker 13:  website that I, I get all that And I respect it and

761
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,160
Speaker 13:  it's very cool. I'm excited about the flip.

762
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,240
Speaker 9:  The flip also costs a lot less.

763
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,640
Speaker 13:  It's like a thousand bucks because

764
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,760
Speaker 9:  I'm excited about those things, but I'm not $1,800 excited, which is how

765
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,200
Speaker 9:  much the like Fold and the Pixel Fold costs.

766
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,360
Speaker 13:  Yeah. For $1,800 I'll get off the couch and go look

767
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,560
Speaker 13:  at my laptop. I think That's enough money.

768
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,800
Speaker 13:  So I, I think it's an interesting moment for the flip phones

769
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:08,560
Speaker 13:  just being at that nine ninety nine price point is like,

770
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:12,800
Speaker 13:  we're used to paying that much for phones or like having our carriers pay

771
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,720
Speaker 13:  that much and paying them back with our contracts. So

772
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,480
Speaker 13:  I think those are positioned a little better to take off.

773
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,360
Speaker 13:  And. I'm curious how the, how the kind of like

774
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,920
Speaker 13:  minimalist aspects of the phone are gonna appeal to people

775
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,180
Speaker 13:  or I don't know, maybe, maybe we all just do really

776
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:36,540
Speaker 13:  want phone plus maybe we all want more phone all the time.

777
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,180
Speaker 7:  Everyone just wants bigger screens. That's my theory. Yeah. Although e even

778
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,620
Speaker 7:  in this case, you're like, you know what really unlocked these flip phones

779
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,700
Speaker 7:  for me was when they added bigger screens to the front.

780
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,100
Speaker 13:  It's, it's true. All

781
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,540
Speaker 7:  Of all of tech is figuring out where you'd make the screen bigger to make

782
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:54,300
Speaker 7:  people buy. The next one is the inside. No, this time it's the outside. Like

783
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,340
Speaker 7:  that's, that's, that's the tech industry.

784
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:00,740
Speaker 13:  Next time around the back we'll have a screen and then I'm sold.

785
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:01,100
Speaker 13:  Yeah.

786
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,460
Speaker 7:  Do they say anything about durability? I mean this is what people are afraid

787
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,300
Speaker 7:  of the most with these phones?

788
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:09,780
Speaker 13:  Yeah, it's kind of this a little more the same this year. The

789
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,620
Speaker 13:  new hinge has a slightly different structure that's supposed to take

790
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:17,780
Speaker 13:  impacts a little better personally. That's another thing I'm worried about

791
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,700
Speaker 13:  with a folding bone. I'm worried about like a speck of dust getting under

792
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,220
Speaker 13:  the screen, but they're, they have gotten better

793
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,460
Speaker 13:  generation after generation. They say it's, it's still rated

794
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,420
Speaker 13:  to like 200,000 folds, which is like five years of use and

795
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,820
Speaker 13:  it's IPX eight rated. So they're both fully like water

796
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:40,540
Speaker 13:  submersible, but it's just a question mark like four years down the line,

797
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,180
Speaker 13:  how, how good is it at like

798
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:48,060
Speaker 13:  holding up, you know, how's the hinge? Did you get like a little bit of

799
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,780
Speaker 13:  dust underneath and ruin everything? That's the question mark.

800
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,900
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That IP X eight, that X is not dust protected. Yeah.

801
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:59,060
Speaker 7:  Like it's like very obvious. Like we're not gonna make that promise. Like

802
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,220
Speaker 7:  yeah,

803
00:45:59,220 --> 00:45:59,940
Speaker 13:  It's just a nope.

804
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,580
Speaker 7:  There's some other stuff that happened at Samsung. What else did they announce?

805
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,220
Speaker 8:  You know, what is dust rated? The new tablets.

806
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,300
Speaker 7:  Oh my god. Alex.

807
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,860
Speaker 8:  That was, wasn't that the best segue you've ever heard?

808
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:14,260
Speaker 13:  Yeah,

809
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,500
Speaker 7:  It's good. Some, yeah, sometimes you gotta just do it like a truck

810
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:22,860
Speaker 7:  just rumble into the, the frame with a Samsung tablet.

811
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,780
Speaker 8:  You know what's really dust rated

812
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,900
Speaker 8:  IP six eight baby. Yeah. These new, they're s

813
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:35,580
Speaker 8:  nines, right? That's that's the name of these. They are outrageously

814
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,140
Speaker 8:  expensive it sounds like. And everybody else is releasing cheaper

815
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,820
Speaker 8:  Android tablets. Are, are you excited about them at all? Allison

816
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,820
Speaker 8:  as like a person who uses Android more than I ever will.

817
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,940
Speaker 13:  No, I am a terrible person to ask about tablets. I

818
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,820
Speaker 13:  literally just bought like a three-year-old iPad for my toddler

819
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:58,020
Speaker 13:  and that's like the most I've thought about tablets in the past

820
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,260
Speaker 13:  few years. I think

821
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,860
Speaker 8:  That's like most people At this point,

822
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:07,660
Speaker 8:  right? Yeah. Like most people are kind of, we're we're happy to have them.

823
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,020
Speaker 8:  We want them, but they're not something that people get enthusiastic about

824
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,180
Speaker 8:  unless you're really concerned about dust rating and waterproofing

825
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,380
Speaker 8:  on your new tablet. In which case, and these have OLED screens,

826
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:22,500
Speaker 8:  like OLED displays, there's the Tab SS

827
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:26,300
Speaker 8:  nine, which is 11 inches. The Tab SS nine

828
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:30,080
Speaker 8:  plus, which is 12.4 inches and the

829
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,160
Speaker 8:  Ultra, which is 14.6. And at that point

830
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,440
Speaker 8:  do you just buy a tv?

831
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,000
Speaker 7:  You buy a laptop? Yeah. I mean, so this is the, and Google

832
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,440
Speaker 7:  has made some like new investment in Android tablets. Like they, they're

833
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,240
Speaker 7:  talking about it again, right? They've got the Pixel tablet, obviously

834
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:51,080
Speaker 7:  the, the foldable phones, particularly the Fold and the Pixel Fold.

835
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,840
Speaker 7:  The point of those is you put them in a tablet mode, so there's like a lot

836
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,600
Speaker 7:  of action on this side of the house and you just look at these Samsung tablets

837
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,760
Speaker 7:  and you're like, these are little laptops, especially at the bigger sizes.

838
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,600
Speaker 7:  They've got all those sort of iPad pro surface like

839
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,920
Speaker 7:  docs and adapters and keyboard, all the stuff is there and then you're like,

840
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,200
Speaker 7:  but I'm using not just Android, like Samsung,

841
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:18,640
Speaker 7:  Spen Android. Maybe some people like it send us emails. If you're like

842
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,080
Speaker 7:  a hardcore spen person and you

843
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:26,600
Speaker 7:  trust your workflow to that, I just, that just feels tenuous

844
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,760
Speaker 7:  to me. Yeah. Even though Samsung's been doing it for years, it's like, I'm

845
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,680
Speaker 7:  gonna get backed into a corner of Samsung's weird pen ideas and

846
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,960
Speaker 7:  then if they ever go away or Samsung like pulls the report and changes it,

847
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,840
Speaker 7:  like I'll be unsettled. Like I'm, I I don't like that.

848
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:41,840
Speaker 7:  Like going

849
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,760
Speaker 8:  From the little tiny pen to a proper stylist with an iPad is gonna like

850
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,400
Speaker 8:  blow those people's minds.

851
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,680
Speaker 7:  I won't even, I won't like, part of the reason that I won't put my workflow

852
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,920
Speaker 7:  on the iPad is every year apple's like, here's a new

853
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,080
Speaker 7:  multitasking idea and they just like rip it out and replace, you know, it's

854
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,000
Speaker 7:  like where they glue stage manager onto it And. I'm like, I got work to do.

855
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,720
Speaker 7:  I I I can't be on this journey with you. Call me when you settle

856
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:07,040
Speaker 7:  down.

857
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,160
Speaker 8:  I just feel like these Tab ss nines, like, they've kind of settled into a

858
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,600
Speaker 8:  lot of it. Like the the changes here Yeah. Are pretty small. They, they've

859
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,960
Speaker 8:  seem to have figured it out. They seem comfortable with their price point

860
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,560
Speaker 8:  even though it's more than everybody else. But they've also been at this

861
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,960
Speaker 8:  price point in this space for a lot longer, more

862
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,520
Speaker 8:  consistently than other Android tablets.

863
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,080
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I I I'm just putting at the call, if you are a hardcore

864
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:35,280
Speaker 7:  Samsung tablet person and you saw this and you thought,

865
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,600
Speaker 7:  one, I need to switch from an iPad to the Spen ecosystem,

866
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,640
Speaker 7:  like, I want to hear for you in particular, I'm looking at you straight through

867
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,280
Speaker 7:  the barrel of the camera right now. I want to know you

868
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,640
Speaker 8:  Right into their soul.

869
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:52,120
Speaker 7:  Just please reach out. Or if you are an existing

870
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:55,640
Speaker 7:  like Spen person and you're like, oh shit, I gotta upgrade.

871
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,840
Speaker 7:  I just wanna hear from you like, what's it like in your brain?

872
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:06,240
Speaker 7:  Is it cool? Like, let me know. I'm just like dying to know. I think we're,

873
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,400
Speaker 7:  we're past that point even with the, the, the market leaders. Like I don't

874
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,440
Speaker 7:  think people are dying to upgrade from one surface to the next. Right. I

875
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,200
Speaker 7:  think their surface break or they get slow and then they like just get the

876
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,480
Speaker 7:  new one. Allison. I think that's your point about the iPad. Like

877
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,720
Speaker 7:  At this point. You, you cannot tell me what a new iPad can do that my existing

878
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,480
Speaker 7:  iPad can't do.

879
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:27,720
Speaker 13:  Yeah. It it's gonna run cocoa melon just fine.

880
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:32,200
Speaker 7:  Exactly. And, I get it right. Like with some of this vision Pro

881
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,840
Speaker 7:  stuff with Apple, like there's a whole suite of, I like the

882
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:39,840
Speaker 7:  iPad app ecosystem is the foundation of a bunch of things for

883
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,680
Speaker 7:  Apple in a way that Apple's good at managing the ecosystem. And on the Google

884
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:47,680
Speaker 7:  side that Android proper, like they are making this investment in tablets.

885
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,000
Speaker 7:  Like I think they see a slow step

886
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:55,720
Speaker 7:  path that way. I'm just very curious. Specifically Samsung

887
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:59,520
Speaker 7:  tablets, like if you're hardcore in a Samsung, like I just, that's what The

888
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,080
Speaker 7:  Verge is for.

889
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:04,640
Speaker 8:  You gotta pixel tablet, get out, don't email.

890
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,200
Speaker 8:  How

891
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,000
Speaker 7:  Many members are in r slash Samsung tablets? Is that even

892
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,080
Speaker 7:  a subreddit? Is there like forum drama in the r slash Samsung

893
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,520
Speaker 7:  tablet subreddit? Like, I just wanna know.

894
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,560
Speaker 8:  All right. I can't transition this one as well as the last one, but I do,

895
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:18,960
Speaker 8:  what's

896
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,840
Speaker 7:  An IP 68 rated?

897
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,480
Speaker 8:  I don't know. The IP 68 rating on the new Galaxy Watch

898
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,600
Speaker 8:  six series. 'cause there's more than one. God, there's not a pro

899
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,520
Speaker 8:  right now. There was a pro last year, but there is, there's a watch and

900
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,440
Speaker 8:  there's a classic. And the big thing Victoria is Oh, so excited

901
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,960
Speaker 8:  about it is they've got rotating bezels.

902
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,120
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Bring 'em back. Yeah.

903
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:42,240
Speaker 8:  They're

904
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,440
Speaker 13:  Huge. Just the classic though.

905
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:44,440
Speaker 8:  Just the classic.

906
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:48,200
Speaker 13:  Yeah. And which is the one that's a hundred dollars more

907
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,640
Speaker 8:  And it's bigger. It's like comes in like a 44 and a 47

908
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,720
Speaker 8:  millimeter, which I don't got the wrist for that. No, my wrist

909
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:00,320
Speaker 8:  can't support that. Like I gotta, I gotta go to the gym a lot more if I'm

910
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,240
Speaker 8:  gonna wear the watch that big. Yeah, like that's rough. But it seems

911
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:08,280
Speaker 8:  cool. V I know is like, she's just terrifically excited about

912
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,200
Speaker 8:  it. And it sounds like other watch fans, Samsung watch

913
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,120
Speaker 8:  fans are excited 'cause they can't have Apple watches, so this is what they

914
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:15,880
Speaker 8:  have to get excited about.

915
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,600
Speaker 7:  I mean they're cool. They look cool the the round. Like I, I love a

916
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,680
Speaker 7:  rotating bezel. I think that's just like, it's so funny that I love it.

917
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,960
Speaker 7:  Like I think the digital crown is so silly, but I'm like rotating bezel.

918
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,320
Speaker 7:  Yes. That's what sings to me because

919
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:33,440
Speaker 8:  It's like, it reminds you of when you'd get that first watch with a rotating

920
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,800
Speaker 8:  bezel as a kid and it had that click and that, oh my gosh. That click was,

921
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,000
Speaker 8:  oh my god. Yeah, that's a good click. The,

922
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,800
Speaker 13:  The digital crown is annoying with fingernails too. Like yes, I have to

923
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,680
Speaker 13:  really get my fingernails on it.

924
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,520
Speaker 8:  And you ship your finger, like if you have paint on your nails, it'll chip

925
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,880
Speaker 8:  a little. Yeah. And then you're like, why should I even manipulate this stupid

926
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:55,960
Speaker 8:  crown? I'm gonna go get my phone. Yeah. Yeah. If it only had

927
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,640
Speaker 8:  had a rotating bezel like get on this apple, it could be square.

928
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,320
Speaker 8:  It works. So

929
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,960
Speaker 9:  The big new feature is not these new funny face watch faces that are extremely

930
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,600
Speaker 9:  creepy. That's

931
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,480
Speaker 8:  Not it. That's also there. you know

932
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,320
Speaker 7:  How like big things are unsettling? Like things that are slightly too big

933
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,440
Speaker 7:  or unsettling? Yeah, that's these watch faces.

934
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,000
Speaker 8:  It's just a little Ooh. I don't, Hmm.

935
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:23,120
Speaker 7:  Yeah, they're just, I'm like, I'm looking at this seven on this watch

936
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,760
Speaker 7:  face. I'm like, I don't Too big. Too big too. Like

937
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,280
Speaker 7:  they, I don't wanna look at it anymore.

938
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:31,440
Speaker 8:  What if it's just a quick glance at your wrist? I mean that'll keep you from

939
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,840
Speaker 8:  like looking at your watch all the time.

940
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:37,080
Speaker 7:  And, I. No, they've kept the hands at the same size. Actually telling the

941
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,760
Speaker 7:  time on this face in particular is more difficult. The numbers

942
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,680
Speaker 7:  are big and the hands are small. It's a very odd choice. You're

943
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,320
Speaker 8:  Just gonna be like this checking your watch in meetings. It's gonna be

944
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,080
Speaker 7:  Great. Famously using hands to check the time is so intuitive that You can

945
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,880
Speaker 7:  have big hands and no numbers. Rarely do you see

946
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,880
Speaker 7:  big numbers and no hands. It's gonna be fine guys. I

947
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,800
Speaker 7:  think it's cool. Yeah.

948
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,160
Speaker 14:  Some of them have mouths that I don't like.

949
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:03,920
Speaker 14:  They all, yeah,

950
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:07,480
Speaker 7:  It's all about how you get attention in a Best Buy. It's like you walking

951
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,280
Speaker 7:  down the aisle, there's like a big apple display that they co-brand. There's

952
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,080
Speaker 7:  whatever. There's like all the carrier noise and it's like, does that watch

953
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:17,000
Speaker 7:  have a mouth? It'll work. That's the

954
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,560
Speaker 3:  One. It'll work.

955
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:22,120
Speaker 7:  It'll super work to get your attention. All right,

956
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,080
Speaker 7:  we gotta end this. We, we've talked about watches with teeth for too long.

957
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,120
Speaker 7:  We'll be right back with a lightning round.

958
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,800
Speaker 15:  You are the man who gave them the power to destroy themselves

959
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,560
Speaker 15:  and the world is not prepared.

960
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,120
Speaker 14:  Oppenheimer opens in theaters today. Christopher Nolan's

961
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:46,880
Speaker 14:  feverishly anticipated film about the brilliant but troubled father

962
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,680
Speaker 14:  of the atomic bomb. Do you guys

963
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,640
Speaker 3:  Ever think about dying?

964
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,960
Speaker 14:  Yeah. No, I don't wanna talk about Oppenheimer today. You can go back to

965
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,200
Speaker 14:  your regular life or You can know the truth about the universe.

966
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:03,240
Speaker 14:  The choice is now yours. The first one. Okay ladies,

967
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:05,040
Speaker 14:  let's do this. And I,

968
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:06,600
Speaker 3:  Let's do this.

969
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:11,280
Speaker 14:  I'm ready to flip on those heels. Fall off your roof. We're having a giant

970
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,280
Speaker 14:  blowout party with planned choreography and a bespoke song. And we're gonna

971
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,800
Speaker 14:  sleep over tonight because we're girlfriend, boyfriend. It's today. Explain

972
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,000
Speaker 14:  and it's the best day ever and so is yesterday and so is tomorrow. And

973
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,360
Speaker 14:  every weekday at 2:00 PM when we drop a new episode of today, explain.

974
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,680
Speaker 16:  Listen, even if you don't have student loans yourself, you

975
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,280
Speaker 16:  probably know someone that does. Which means you also know the system

976
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,040
Speaker 16:  is broken. But have you ever wondered how

977
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,240
Speaker 16:  exactly it got this way?

978
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,400
Speaker 17:  There's a high demand for college because of this huge economic shift in

979
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,320
Speaker 17:  the US economy and the global economy and that you have this

980
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:58,640
Speaker 17:  like, you know, free flowing access to credit

981
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:03,320
Speaker 17:  and then you head uninformed consumers. I mean this is just a recipe

982
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,920
Speaker 17:  for disaster.

983
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:09,960
Speaker 16:  Your student loan debt. And then some explained that's this week on the

984
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:13,000
Speaker 16:  weeds. Listen wherever you get your podcasts,

985
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,280
Speaker 7:  We're back. We're gonna do a quick lightning round and then I just wanna

986
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,000
Speaker 7:  read some of the responses we got to consumer product

987
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:31,000
Speaker 7:  Turf wars. I'll tell you, we're gonna talk about DeWalt versus Milwaukee

988
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,640
Speaker 7:  on The Vergecast today. It's gonna be incredible. But we got some great responses.

989
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,600
Speaker 7:  And, I want, I wanna talk about them. But first let's do a little lightning

990
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,480
Speaker 7:  round. Cranz, you're up first.

991
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,240
Speaker 8:  All right. OpenAI has been working on a system to detect AI

992
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,160
Speaker 8:  written content and it's not going well. So they said we're, we're

993
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,080
Speaker 8:  just gonna stop doing that.

994
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,960
Speaker 7:  The blog post, they put up a blog post silently. They didn't even tell anyone

995
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,200
Speaker 7:  about it. Yeah, they just like updated the blog post where they had announced

996
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,840
Speaker 7:  this tool and they're like, we've discontinued the tool because the tool

997
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,920
Speaker 7:  doesn't work very well.

998
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:03,800
Speaker 8:  They're like, nevermind. Yeah. Nope. Not doing it. And yeah,

999
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,240
Speaker 8:  so So that's a little disconcerting because there's a lot of, obviously a

1000
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,040
Speaker 8:  lot of use cases for where it'd be nice to quickly check if something is

1001
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,800
Speaker 8:  written by ai, but it turns out that's a lot harder than getting in AI

1002
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,120
Speaker 8:  to like write stuff.

1003
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,360
Speaker 7:  I feel like I am good at detecting when something is written by ai.

1004
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:24,520
Speaker 8:  Yes. A friend sent me, this is so horrible. A

1005
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,240
Speaker 8:  friend sent me an obituary for a friend of theirs who had passed

1006
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:32,320
Speaker 8:  and it was very clearly written by AI and it said things Like.

1007
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,440
Speaker 8:  he worked in the Atlantic Ocean

1008
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:40,240
Speaker 8:  and the guy apparently would've thought this was absolutely hysterical and

1009
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,800
Speaker 8:  would've found it very, very funny. But it's just like somebody take a pass

1010
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,280
Speaker 8:  at that.

1011
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:44,840
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1012
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,960
Speaker 9:  It's one of those things I feel like it comes from editing so many people,

1013
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,120
Speaker 9:  so many times you start to recognize people's phrase and their styles. Yes.

1014
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,400
Speaker 9:  It's sort of humanlike in that way in that everyone has favorite phrases

1015
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,960
Speaker 9:  that they don't even know they have and it has

1016
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,920
Speaker 7:  That. Yeah, particularly chat, g chat g p D has like tropes in construct

1017
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,480
Speaker 7:  like You can s You can, it has a style. It's a boring

1018
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:09,160
Speaker 7:  robotic style, but it has a style. And like Richard said, if you, if you

1019
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,840
Speaker 7:  are in the business of constantly editing other people's writing, you start

1020
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,240
Speaker 7:  to recognize style like very quickly. Like I think

1021
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,720
Speaker 7:  I could probably read The Verge of that bylines and get it 90%

1022
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,440
Speaker 7:  right. Who wrote what, right. Like just on a day-to-day basis. I can, I can

1023
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,120
Speaker 7:  tell you when Liz Lipato has written something,

1024
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,560
Speaker 8:  Oh, next week on The Verge

1025
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:30,480
Speaker 7:  Cast, it's just me guessing a bylines. I can, I can

1026
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,600
Speaker 7:  probably pick David Pierce out of a block of copy in two seconds flat.

1027
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,520
Speaker 7:  Like I've edited David for so long. I I know David so well. I think a lot

1028
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,440
Speaker 7:  of our listeners can like read us into our writing and it's so that we get

1029
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:46,120
Speaker 7:  a, you just do a chat G p t now it's just funny that OpenAI can't do it.

1030
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:50,360
Speaker 7:  Like they're like, we can't do this. The robot can't see itself.

1031
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:53,320
Speaker 7:  It's like a very funny outcome. It's very good. All right. Richard, what's

1032
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,480
Speaker 7:  your lightning round?

1033
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:58,920
Speaker 9:  This na, this charging network announcement from seven automakers. We've

1034
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,840
Speaker 9:  got B M W, gm, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Benzs

1035
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,080
Speaker 9:  and STIs. Nice. They combined, they said they're gonna put it, they're gonna

1036
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,080
Speaker 9:  build 30,000 charging locations by 2030.

1037
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,800
Speaker 9:  The first ones shouldn't be here until next year, but like some of them,

1038
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,600
Speaker 9:  they're planning to put along highways and then kind of the high traffic

1039
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,760
Speaker 9:  spots are gonna make sure that there are places where You can go get food

1040
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,360
Speaker 9:  and do other things while your car is charging and just kind of revamp the

1041
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,840
Speaker 9:  North American charging infrastructure.

1042
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,840
Speaker 7:  Are they doing by 20, are you using the Tesla, the n a c s connector or are

1043
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,320
Speaker 7:  they doing c c s? Do they say they

1044
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:32,200
Speaker 9:  Will At least right now the plan is to have both the c

1045
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,160
Speaker 9:  c s, the combined charging system, like the older style that most cars have

1046
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:39,600
Speaker 9:  so far and also the N A C SS standards that Tesla and most,

1047
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,360
Speaker 9:  at least some of these automakers and some several other automakers have

1048
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,360
Speaker 9:  said they'll use kind of starting in 2025. Yeah,

1049
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,000
Speaker 7:  Well I guess they have to support their existing cars. I guess they need

1050
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,960
Speaker 7:  c c s. It's just a was a weird time like for all

1051
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,440
Speaker 7:  of this infrastructure. Like we were thinking about buying a new

1052
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:59,720
Speaker 7:  charger for our house And I was like, which standard do I

1053
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:03,320
Speaker 7:  like? Do I buy the one for the car I have now or the car I might get in it.

1054
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:04,560
Speaker 7:  It's a very weird time.

1055
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:07,160
Speaker 8:  Real micro mini U s b well

1056
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,680
Speaker 7:  Like, but like a mini U S B cable. Like I'll just buy this cable. It was

1057
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,120
Speaker 7:  like $3 off. I'll do some e-waste to like move on with my life. This is like

1058
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,400
Speaker 7:  I need to spend $500 And I might only last like it, it's only

1059
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,320
Speaker 7:  gonna last this car, you know. Very strange. Okay, Allison, what's

1060
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:21,560
Speaker 7:  yours?

1061
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:26,040
Speaker 13:  Mine's a two-parter. So Wess wrote up some

1062
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,960
Speaker 13:  T-mobile news, which is like cool, exciting T-mobile news. They

1063
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,880
Speaker 13:  successfully, they have reach speeds of 3.3

1064
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,840
Speaker 13:  gigabits per second with four carrier aggregation. And this is,

1065
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:42,080
Speaker 13:  this is like in the wild their their actual working five

1066
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,240
Speaker 13:  G network. They can do this because they have a standalone network that

1067
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:48,880
Speaker 13:  they bought from Sprint. Not from Sprint. They bought Sprint.

1068
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:50,920
Speaker 7:  It's true.

1069
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:55,040
Speaker 13:  Cool. so like cool. Yay. Good job. T-Mobile. The other news

1070
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:59,600
Speaker 13:  that Sheena wrote up earlier this week is that they're now charging

1071
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,400
Speaker 13:  people $5 to pay their bills in the store.

1072
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,920
Speaker 13:  So if you don't, if you can't pay online or if you

1073
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:12,040
Speaker 13:  don't want to or whatever reason you have, you go into a T-Mobile

1074
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,520
Speaker 13:  store to pay them money for your phone service,

1075
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:18,920
Speaker 13:  they're gonna charge you extra money to do that. So

1076
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:21,920
Speaker 13:  there's the dark side of T-mobile news.

1077
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,240
Speaker 7:  Do they explain why they're doing that?

1078
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,960
Speaker 13:  They call it a payment support charge.

1079
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:29,240
Speaker 7:  Oh sure.

1080
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:30,080
Speaker 13:  Yeah.

1081
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:32,560
Speaker 9:  It's, it's innovation. Yeah.

1082
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,840
Speaker 8:  It should be called a Boomer support charge.

1083
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,520
Speaker 13:  Like, oh boy, this is

1084
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,280
Speaker 8:  Just, that's rough. This is, I say this, my mom I think is a T-Mobile customer

1085
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,880
Speaker 8:  and she definitely is like, I'm going to the T-Mobile store today. And. I

1086
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,160
Speaker 8:  was like, you got more than once a month. What's happening there?

1087
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,720
Speaker 13:  I go to the Verizon store, like more than the average person

1088
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:56,640
Speaker 13:  and they're, they're not that busy. Like I think they can handle

1089
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,920
Speaker 13:  a few boomers coming in to pay their bills. I don't know.

1090
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:01,320
Speaker 13:  All

1091
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,720
Speaker 9:  They need to do is add a credit for every single time they get hacked and

1092
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,040
Speaker 9:  leak your information. And then no one would get charged this for like the

1093
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,160
Speaker 9:  next two or three years. And, I could just ease it in. It would be great.

1094
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:09,480
Speaker 9:  I

1095
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,640
Speaker 7:  Wish we had any data on how many people are going in these stores to pay

1096
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,600
Speaker 7:  their bills. Like they're obviously trying to deter you from doing it. It

1097
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,400
Speaker 7:  must cost them more somehow. I, I guess I think, I don't know,

1098
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:18,960
Speaker 7:  maybe

1099
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,240
Speaker 8:  There's not that many and they're like, you know what, this is an extra like

1100
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:26,160
Speaker 8:  $500 a month for us. why not? They're there but

1101
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,760
Speaker 13:  Like what are they doing? They're just load, they're like loading your

1102
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:33,200
Speaker 13:  profile on a tablet that they're holding at the store and like

1103
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,800
Speaker 13:  punching in numbers. Like I, I

1104
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,320
Speaker 8:  Don't know. They're taking your card. Yeah. Or your cash.

1105
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:39,200
Speaker 13:  Yeah.

1106
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,120
Speaker 7:  I will never forget. This is not about T-Mobile. I'll take any chance to

1107
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:47,000
Speaker 7:  dunk on at t. I can get At this point. A long, long time ago I was complaining

1108
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,640
Speaker 7:  about something with at and t and an at and t spokesperson called me.

1109
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:55,440
Speaker 7:  This is ages ago. I'm out of my own background policy. This was like on

1110
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,920
Speaker 7:  background. They called me, I was like a little baby reporter and they dressed

1111
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:03,000
Speaker 7:  me down because they're like, you do not understand how complicated

1112
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,760
Speaker 7:  the at and t billing system is. If we, if you want to make any

1113
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,520
Speaker 7:  changes, it requires 60,000 people to work for a year

1114
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,600
Speaker 7:  to change the font on this website and like propagate the billing

1115
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,840
Speaker 7:  system changes. And I was like, oh that sounds right. And now I'm like, oh,

1116
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,440
Speaker 7:  they were just flying.

1117
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:23,160
Speaker 9:  They, they probably weren't And I. And I can tell you why. Because again,

1118
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,000
Speaker 9:  reaching into my own past working at Comcast, woo, I don't know if it's still

1119
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,440
Speaker 9:  like this, but within 10, 15 years ago,

1120
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:34,840
Speaker 9:  it essentially was still a Doss system that the billing system ran on and

1121
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,160
Speaker 9:  then they came out with another system that was on top of that. But you've

1122
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,760
Speaker 9:  got, you're talking about a billing system that was written in like Cobalt

1123
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,800
Speaker 9:  or something. Yeah. So they cannot change anything. All right. But I think

1124
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,920
Speaker 9:  with T-Mobile it's, they don't want to have anyone spending time doing this

1125
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,120
Speaker 9:  in store 'cause they want them upselling you on phones. Yeah. They're

1126
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,480
Speaker 7:  Like, have you seen this case? Also,

1127
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,280
Speaker 9:  They're really trying to push people into auto pay because like

1128
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,000
Speaker 9:  those direct bank authorizations and those kind of auto payments, it's good

1129
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,720
Speaker 9:  for their bottom line and also it's cheaper than like authorizing a card,

1130
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,200
Speaker 9:  doing a check or even handling cash or something like that. Yeah. So they're

1131
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,640
Speaker 9:  just really trying to push auto pay.

1132
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,120
Speaker 8:  I just think all the T-mobile employees actually have to be COBOL like

1133
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:13,320
Speaker 8:  programmers and that's why they're charging the extra 'cause

1134
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:14,240
Speaker 8:  it's to offset

1135
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,720
Speaker 9:  It'd be more secure. Yeah. If they were,

1136
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:19,720
Speaker 7:  It's that's the Coble bonus that they're, they're like, there's one wizard

1137
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:23,400
Speaker 7:  and they owe him more money every year and they're like, we gotta fund this

1138
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,840
Speaker 7:  Coble bonus. Yep. Who knows. Allison, while I have you here and we're talking

1139
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,680
Speaker 7:  carriers, can I, can I get a quick Gen five sis update? Oh yeah, we mentioned

1140
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,320
Speaker 7:  Sprint so we gotta do it. So T-Mobile bought Sprint. We brought our

1141
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:38,160
Speaker 7:  nation's carriers down to three. We were supposed to invent a new carrier

1142
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:41,840
Speaker 7:  out of Dish network. What's going on? Do we have a fourth carrier yet?

1143
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:46,160
Speaker 13:  We do not. We still have project gen fives,

1144
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:50,240
Speaker 13:  which is still kind of in beta. They say that they met their,

1145
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:54,080
Speaker 13:  their June F C C deadline, which was like

1146
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:58,280
Speaker 13:  70% of the population. They needed to cover the

1147
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:02,200
Speaker 13:  one in I wanna say 2020. Yeah, I think next year is like

1148
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,120
Speaker 13:  the big one, which would be, it's a certain amount of

1149
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,240
Speaker 13:  covering like a certain amount of the places where they hold spectrum licenses,

1150
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,120
Speaker 13:  which is trickier and more expensive I guess. So the short answer

1151
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:18,040
Speaker 13:  is no. Something I did write up this week

1152
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,920
Speaker 13:  is that You can sign up for Boost Infinite through Amazon Prime

1153
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,680
Speaker 13:  now. So that's what we got.

1154
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:28,000
Speaker 7:  That's good. That's really the big three carriers quaking in their boots.

1155
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,120
Speaker 7:  'cause You can sign up for Boost Infinite with Infinite, Amazon Prime. All

1156
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:35,080
Speaker 7:  right. My lightning round, just a really quick one. Verin reviewed

1157
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:38,680
Speaker 7:  the D G I Mavic Air three this week. It's new drone

1158
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:42,560
Speaker 7:  and he actually sparked a really interesting conversation on YouTube, in

1159
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,640
Speaker 7:  our YouTube comments about how drones have gotten kind of boring. Like the

1160
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,600
Speaker 7:  innovation cycle of drones has started to slow down and we're kind of the

1161
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,960
Speaker 7:  same place with phones where we're just talking about pretty

1162
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,760
Speaker 7:  incremental camera upgrades every year. And the actual

1163
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,680
Speaker 7:  part of like the camera can fly by itself is no

1164
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,280
Speaker 7:  longer interesting. Which is just a remarkable place to be.

1165
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,520
Speaker 7:  Go check out that YouTube con. It's like really good. Vera is very proud

1166
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,840
Speaker 7:  of the review. It's a great review. He flew the drone into a storm, which

1167
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,920
Speaker 7:  you're not supposed to do. The shots are beautiful, but it's just a really

1168
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,640
Speaker 7:  great example of like the community that we have on our site and on our platforms.

1169
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:20,400
Speaker 7:  Just like talking about a thing altogether really great, like super into

1170
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,680
Speaker 7:  it. And that brings us to fighting.

1171
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:24,560
Speaker 8:  Yes.

1172
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,600
Speaker 8:  I got too excited. Sorry.

1173
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:31,760
Speaker 7:  So last week we were joking about the cyber truck and whether or not people

1174
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,720
Speaker 7:  had strong opinions about Windshield washer fluid. It turns out they

1175
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,480
Speaker 7:  do. Okay, whatever. We're gonna set that aside for like a full,

1176
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,720
Speaker 7:  I, I can't even begin to evaluate that situation

1177
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:47,000
Speaker 7:  except to say you should not use plain water. I just can't. That's

1178
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,520
Speaker 13:  A thing. I

1179
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:50,320
Speaker 7:  Don't do it. Yeah, a bunch of people email us like the only answer is plain

1180
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,040
Speaker 7:  water. And it's like if maybe if you live in the desert, I don't know man.

1181
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:54,960
Speaker 7:  I live work at school. We're

1182
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,400
Speaker 8:  Gonna do Soda Mountain Dew,

1183
01:06:56,870 --> 01:07:00,720
Speaker 7:  Coca-Cola, Coke Heavy. Just spray that on your car. It's gonna be

1184
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,640
Speaker 7:  great. And we asked all of you to send us what your favorite like

1185
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:08,680
Speaker 7:  versus R, so there's iOS versus Android. We said you can't do

1186
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,440
Speaker 7:  that too easy. Just pure engagement, right? Like you walk out in the street

1187
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,920
Speaker 7:  and you say iOS versus Android and like a hundred people form a circle around

1188
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,680
Speaker 7:  you and start arguing Mac versus Windows. It used to be the thing. I think

1189
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,560
Speaker 7:  it's declined. We're like, what are the other ones? So we got this one. Haven't

1190
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:27,480
Speaker 7:  evaluated it, but Rob tells us that V H s versus beta

1191
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,240
Speaker 7:  is still going. Yes.

1192
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:29,960
Speaker 13:  Wow.

1193
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:34,160
Speaker 7:  Which is incredible. I'm super into that. This one

1194
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:37,880
Speaker 7:  is pure Vergecast bait. Richard. I'm dying for your thoughts here. Chase

1195
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:41,720
Speaker 7:  tells us I'm in a discord for the A M C A-list subscribers.

1196
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:45,760
Speaker 7:  And the fight between IMAX and Dolby fans is so intense

1197
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:49,960
Speaker 7:  that they make you choose forum flare to show which side

1198
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,640
Speaker 7:  you're on. And then he says the answer of course is IMAX

1199
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:58,240
Speaker 9:  Of co. Of course there are fan boys. Of course there are stands. I've never

1200
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,320
Speaker 9:  actually been to Dolby Theater. Like I would've to drive like 30 miles out

1201
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,480
Speaker 9:  out my way to go to Dolby Theater. Will I do it? Yes. Because I need to get

1202
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,000
Speaker 9:  into this battle.

1203
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,040
Speaker 7:  Andrew wrote to us as apparently Bose versus Sony Noise canceling

1204
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,240
Speaker 7:  just like four Wars left and right. Like how can you have an opinion on this?

1205
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,000
Speaker 7:  You,

1206
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:14,840
Speaker 8:  It's Sony.

1207
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:15,840
Speaker 7:  The noise is canceled.

1208
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:17,240
Speaker 8:  Sony, okay.

1209
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:21,240
Speaker 7:  DeWalt versus Milwaukee Power Tools. We should do an entire episode on

1210
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:25,160
Speaker 7:  this. Like people really care about this. I follow a TikTok

1211
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:29,200
Speaker 7:  er who's like a Ryobi power fan and it's just a gadget blog

1212
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,920
Speaker 7:  for Ryobi tools on TikTok. Like an old school

1213
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:37,120
Speaker 7:  gadget blog. If you're a longtime broadcast listener, you know that

1214
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:41,120
Speaker 7:  the tool guide, G U Y D is one of my

1215
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:45,000
Speaker 7:  favorite blogs. It's still going. It is just old school and

1216
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,920
Speaker 7:  gadget for power tools. It is incredible. Chainsaw journal. My

1217
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,640
Speaker 7:  favorite trade publication. It's good, it's good. I'm just telling you it's

1218
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,240
Speaker 7:  good. There are more Ableton versus Freude studio. Apparently a hardcore

1219
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,040
Speaker 7:  battle. Did

1220
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,920
Speaker 13:  We get Canon versus Nikon?

1221
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:03,000
Speaker 7:  Canon versus Nikon? Incredible. Cannot believe I forgot about it. Although

1222
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,840
Speaker 7:  I will say Canon, I'm a Nikon person so I'm gonna say this,

1223
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:11,120
Speaker 7:  it's, it seems like they have figured it out in a way that Nikon is not,

1224
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,200
Speaker 13:  I feel like it's one of those, the Mac versus PC thing where it's like

1225
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,880
Speaker 13:  everybody's just, you've picked your side by now, right? Like are peoples

1226
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:22,960
Speaker 13:  switching between Canon Nikon is, isn't it more

1227
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,840
Speaker 13:  mirrorless? D S L? I don't know. Yeah,

1228
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:29,160
Speaker 7:  That's what I mean. It's like on in the mirrorless world, it's like Sony

1229
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,120
Speaker 7:  and Canon, right? Like they're the winners and that and they're like pro

1230
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:35,920
Speaker 7:  space and then they're sort of Nikon and I'm much like rooting for 'em.

1231
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:38,320
Speaker 7:  They are, You can do it buddy. you know, like you're,

1232
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:40,800
Speaker 8:  They're not rooting for themselves.

1233
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:45,520
Speaker 7:  They don't appear to be rooting for themselves. At this point in time. But

1234
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,880
Speaker 7:  that's a great one. I think

1235
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:50,880
Speaker 8:  My favorite is Shimano versus SRAM to bite components.

1236
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,640
Speaker 7:  That's Dieter. I don't know if that And I don't know if a hundred percent

1237
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,280
Speaker 7:  if that's Dieter sent that to us, but that sounds like Dieter sent that to

1238
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,120
Speaker 8:  Us. Yeah, Dieter is just, just little ghost, ghost email

1239
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,840
Speaker 7:  Richard. What's yours? Mechanical

1240
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,200
Speaker 9:  Keyboards versus ones everyone else in the office tolerates.

1241
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:07,800
Speaker 7:  Especially we, these hybrid workplace. Very good. Sugary, very heated debate.

1242
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,200
Speaker 7:  All right, we got a lot of these we're I keep sending 'em to us. They're

1243
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,600
Speaker 7:  so good. These are good. I, you know, as you know, Liam's dream is that we

1244
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,000
Speaker 7:  make entire episodes like diving deep into these subcultures.

1245
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,280
Speaker 7:  I love getting these emails 'cause it's really funny to hear people's explanations.

1246
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,960
Speaker 7:  I will say the best one we got this week was Vergecast versus waveform.

1247
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,880
Speaker 7:  I think that's very obvious. It's waveform. No, it's The. Vergecast.

1248
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:32,800
Speaker 7:  Come on. We love 'em. That's great. Competition is the, is, you know, the,

1249
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:36,720
Speaker 7:  the, the driving force of, of of interest on this show. So I love

1250
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,960
Speaker 7:  these, these are really great. If you know why V H Ss versus beta is still

1251
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,840
Speaker 7:  going and you want to pitch crayons on writing 1500

1252
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,320
Speaker 7:  words on it, by all means.

1253
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,920
Speaker 8:  I kind of know a little bit. I have a vague idea. There's still like a

1254
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,120
Speaker 8:  really, there part of it's like archival purposes and stuff and there's a

1255
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,920
Speaker 8:  whole subculture around V H Ss tape still because so much stuff got

1256
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,160
Speaker 8:  released on V H s that didn't get released on any other platform. And

1257
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:04,360
Speaker 8:  Beta back actually has higher resolution. It's like higher

1258
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,560
Speaker 8:  fidelity. And so ripping and stuff like betas are superior to rip,

1259
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,360
Speaker 8:  generally speaking than v h s. But the

1260
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,320
Speaker 8:  ripping technology for v h s is better. This is all crisp person And I

1261
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:20,280
Speaker 8:  talk about in our dms. I don't understand 70% of our dms. It's great.

1262
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:24,280
Speaker 7:  1500 words on the website, v h s versus

1263
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:28,320
Speaker 7:  beta is still going. I think it's important. Like this is why The

1264
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,160
Speaker 7:  Verge exists. I just, I cannot be clearer about what our

1265
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:35,920
Speaker 7:  purpose here is. We write about the Samsung phones to pay the bills so we

1266
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,680
Speaker 7:  can write the VHSs beta story, like

1267
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:43,880
Speaker 7:  very clear what what, what our like flow is. I demand it.

1268
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,040
Speaker 7:  I must know. It's good

1269
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:45,880
Speaker 8:  Stuff. Yeah.

1270
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:49,880
Speaker 7:  Alright, send us more if you have, if You can possibly explain the

1271
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,800
Speaker 7:  Rain X thing to me, it's just very good. Like this is what the

1272
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,240
Speaker 7:  internet's for. Lots more of these. Send them, send them to us as again,

1273
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,920
Speaker 7:  Liam's dream is to do an entire episode on these. They're really fun to hear.

1274
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:03,680
Speaker 7:  It's really fun to hear your opinions on, on just Vercast of The Verge dot

1275
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,440
Speaker 7:  com. We love it. That's it. That's the show. I gotta get outta this hotel

1276
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,640
Speaker 7:  room. I've been in it for like 95 hours straight. There's lots of stuff on

1277
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:13,200
Speaker 7:  the site you should read. We wrote a look back at the I River MP three player,

1278
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,080
Speaker 7:  which is like a true gadget nerd MP three player. Great blast from the past.

1279
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:20,240
Speaker 7:  The Chromecast turned 10 years old. Sean Hollister wrote about the original

1280
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,920
Speaker 7:  Chromecast referencing the review of the Chromecast that I wrote that I had

1281
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,630
Speaker 7:  completely forgotten about. He's like, Zaro new And. I was like, Hey, Z,

1282
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:30,040
Speaker 7:  NELI, Pilson, And. I was like, did I say that? Incredible. We have a great

1283
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:34,280
Speaker 7:  piece on the indie game scene in Japan, which is really cool. And then our

1284
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:37,880
Speaker 7:  Google coverage, we're really covering Google search a lot this year, really

1285
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,720
Speaker 7:  thinking about what it means for the internet to be architected around Google

1286
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,120
Speaker 7:  search and how that might change is AI rolls out our very own. David Pierce

1287
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:47,720
Speaker 7:  wrote a story about Neva. It's a profile of Neva, the paid search engine

1288
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:51,000
Speaker 7:  that was meant to compete with Google. It's a bunch of ex Googlers and they

1289
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,760
Speaker 7:  couldn't do it. And that's a story from beginning 10, A startup

1290
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:58,840
Speaker 7:  to failure of a startup really unpacking why Google is so dominant and

01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,080
Speaker 7:  all the ways that it uses its dominance. Really great story, really fun profile

1292
