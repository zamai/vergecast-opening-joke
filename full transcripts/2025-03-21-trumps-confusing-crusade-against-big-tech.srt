Description: Starlink is in the White House, Siri is still bad, Pebble is back, up is down, everything is chaos. In this episode, Nilay and David start the show by running through some big gadget news, from a Siri-related shakeup at Apple to the new Google Pixel 9A. After that, The Verge's Lauren Feiner talks us through some of the  latest in tech regulation: Trump's illegal firings at the FTC, the confusing state of the TikTok ban, OpenAI and Google arguing their case for free-for-all AI, and more. Finally, in the lightning round, Nilay and David talk about the latest Tesla recall, the hugely popular book about Meta, some exciting ActivityPub news, and Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos gently zinging Apple TV Plus.


2
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:38,335
Speaker 7:  Hello and welcome to our chest flagship podcast of the Cyber Truck Wiper

3
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:39,095
Speaker 7:  owners club.

4
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:43,175
Speaker 7:  It's for people who don't have a cyber truck, but they just have one big

5
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:43,575
Speaker 7:  wiper.

6
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:47,415
Speaker 8:  Can you just buy the wiper separately? Like could I just frame a wiper

7
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:49,455
Speaker 8:  above my, my mantle?

8
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:53,615
Speaker 7:  I believe so. Okay. And I believe that might be Tesla's fastest growing revenue

9
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:55,735
Speaker 7:  line. Just giant

10
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:59,135
Speaker 8:  Wipers. Yeah, like the flamethrower, you know, bad choice for a bunch of

11
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:03,055
Speaker 8:  reasons. The tequila. Probably not great tequila, but like would I buy a

12
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:06,495
Speaker 8:  comically humongous windshield wiper and just sort of have it like Yeah,

13
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:06,735
Speaker 8:  I would.

14
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:09,575
Speaker 7:  I mean, I'm sending you one right now. We're gonna, we're gonna take a break

15
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:13,215
Speaker 7:  from this show and I'm gonna figure out how to buy you a cyber truck wiper.

16
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,575
Speaker 7:  Remember when that was the, the story?

17
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:20,175
Speaker 8:  Well then, then we cracked it. We, you and I at South by Southwest, we cracked

18
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:20,575
Speaker 8:  the case.

19
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:24,735
Speaker 7:  People still send me photos of cyber truck wipers. Like if they see a cyber

20
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:28,655
Speaker 7:  truck driving down the street, wiping rain. I, I get tweeted at

21
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:29,575
Speaker 7:  it's like very, you make

22
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:33,015
Speaker 8:  A lot of fun of me for being the person who sold everyone on earth of books

23
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:37,015
Speaker 8:  Palmer. But yours is weirder. Being the cyber

24
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:38,495
Speaker 8:  truck wiper guy is weirder.

25
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:42,975
Speaker 7:  It is. It is also true that the wiper is not very effective. Look, we're

26
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:46,255
Speaker 7:  gonna talk about the cyber truck later and Eon and the go, all the stuff

27
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:50,815
Speaker 7:  we have to start. By the way, I'm my friend Eli, David Pierce is here. Hello

28
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:54,675
Speaker 7:  Warren. Fine is gonna join us for segment two to talk about the government.

29
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,115
Speaker 7:  Our policy reporter is gonna help us talk about the government. You see how

30
00:02:57,115 --> 00:03:00,885
Speaker 7:  that works? We just, we bring in someone who's smarter than us and then she

31
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:04,365
Speaker 7:  does the show. Well, we tell jokes it's perfect. Highly recommend it if you

32
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:07,525
Speaker 7:  can pull it off. We gotta start though with breaking news.

33
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:12,675
Speaker 7:  As we were sitting down to record there is breaking news in the world

34
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:16,435
Speaker 7:  of Apple. It appears that they have

35
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:19,355
Speaker 7:  noticed, noticed. Siri isn't very good.

36
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:25,045
Speaker 7:  Seems great. I can't tell you when this happened or who noticed it, but they're

37
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:26,405
Speaker 7:  making some changes. David, what's going on?

38
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:30,525
Speaker 8:  So Apple had its big like executive retreat

39
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,975
Speaker 8:  last week. I don't know exactly what it's, what they call it The

40
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:34,775
Speaker 7:  Top 100. Is

41
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:37,335
Speaker 8:  It? Is that, what's very famous is that start of Steve of the thing. Steve,

42
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:37,975
Speaker 8:  okay. Yeah. So,

43
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:41,895
Speaker 7:  And I don't know how it how it works now, but the lure at Apple is that

44
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:45,615
Speaker 7:  Steve Jobs literally picked his top 100 people without

45
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:49,495
Speaker 7:  regard for rank or hierarchy or org chart. And making that

46
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:53,175
Speaker 7:  list was a big deal and it was Steve Jobs, so he didn't care about people's

47
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:56,375
Speaker 7:  feelings and they got left out. I, it's a very different company now, but

48
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,255
Speaker 7:  that was the lore of top 100 back in the day.

49
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:02,015
Speaker 8:  First of all, you should make several decoder episodes about the

50
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:05,975
Speaker 8:  top 100 phenomenon. But so basically, so Apple had this meeting

51
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:10,255
Speaker 8:  and by all accounts, lots of reporting, especially from Mark Germin at Bloomberg,

52
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:15,495
Speaker 8:  Siri being awful and the sort of general failure of Apple

53
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:18,625
Speaker 8:  intelligence was one of the big topics.

54
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:23,145
Speaker 8:  And coming out of this, what has happened is the

55
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:26,705
Speaker 8:  person who was running Siri, who was this guy, John

56
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,385
Speaker 8:  Gianna Andrea, who was overseeing a lot of their AI stuff at Apple, he's

57
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:33,785
Speaker 8:  a huge name in this space. He was Google for a long time. He's was a big

58
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:37,665
Speaker 8:  figure in Google's antitrust trial. He is like a person who has seen where

59
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:40,425
Speaker 8:  all the bodies are buried in the tech industry for a very long time. Reports

60
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:41,825
Speaker 7:  Directly to Tim Cook, right?

61
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:45,865
Speaker 8:  It's like this, this very important person inside of Apple is being taken

62
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:50,345
Speaker 8:  off of leadership of the Siri Project, which is now

63
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:54,185
Speaker 8:  going under Mike Rockwell, who until now was the one leading

64
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:58,225
Speaker 8:  kind of all things Vision Pro. And if I understand Apple's org structure

65
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:01,265
Speaker 8:  correctly, and I'm only like 60% sure that I do,

66
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,665
Speaker 8:  Mike Rockwell reports to Craig Fedi who oversees all of software,

67
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,185
Speaker 8:  which would mean Craig Fedi now oversees Siri, which is

68
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:13,425
Speaker 8:  sort of a meaningful coup inside of Apple's work structure.

69
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:17,265
Speaker 8:  Like that would be a big shift away from this sort of AI

70
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:21,145
Speaker 8:  project, which we've seen at a lot of companies sort of slowly annex

71
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:25,025
Speaker 8:  the rest of the companies like Deves who runs DeepMind at Google is

72
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:28,625
Speaker 8:  like rapidly becoming the most powerful person at Google because everything

73
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,305
Speaker 8:  is becoming AI and they're just giving everything to Demis. And that's very

74
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:34,985
Speaker 8:  important. This is a shift, big time in the opposite

75
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:38,145
Speaker 8:  direction inside of Apple. And It is the kind of thing that Apple doesn't

76
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:42,065
Speaker 8:  typically do except to rectify something that is perceived to be

77
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:42,265
Speaker 8:  broken.

78
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:46,425
Speaker 7:  Yeah, we, last week on the show we talked about Apple delaying the next generation

79
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:50,185
Speaker 7:  of Siri. It's, I think Apple's org chart is like

80
00:05:50,295 --> 00:05:53,945
Speaker 7:  weirder in that everyone has worked at Apple for 500

81
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:57,525
Speaker 7:  years. Yes. And they all just get paid a lot. Yeah.

82
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:02,085
Speaker 7:  Like I I, it's, it's hard to actually parse out the sort of back and forth

83
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:06,005
Speaker 7:  between who's in charge of what. Like Apple is very functionally

84
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:09,895
Speaker 7:  organized. Product marketing, what they call product

85
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:13,375
Speaker 7:  marketing is what most tech companies called product management. It's all,

86
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,455
Speaker 7:  it's all, it's just different than other tech companies.

87
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:21,345
Speaker 7:  The thing that gets me at this though is Rockwell was in charge of the Vision

88
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:24,425
Speaker 7:  Pro. They gave it to him to get it out the door. He kind of insisted

89
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,705
Speaker 7:  like around the time of the Vision Pro, he was a face that was popping up.

90
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:33,325
Speaker 7:  We saw him at events. He was the one who really insisted that the Vision

91
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:36,725
Speaker 7:  Pro had to get out the door this way. Right? Mark Garman and Bloomberg has

92
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:37,525
Speaker 7:  reporting that

93
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,455
Speaker 7:  John Andrea saw Rockwell as his successor, which makes no sense to me.

94
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,575
Speaker 7:  I'm just looking at the judgment that I can see, which is the Vision Pro

95
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,695
Speaker 7:  shipped the way the Vision Pro is

96
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:54,115
Speaker 7:  and it's fine. It's a beautiful piece of hardware. It is the most state of

97
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:57,595
Speaker 7:  state-of-the-art VR headset at its price point that works the way it does

98
00:06:57,865 --> 00:07:01,715
Speaker 7:  that you can get It is the best thing of its kind at its price point that

99
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:03,835
Speaker 7:  has ever existed. It is also not very good.

100
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:07,235
Speaker 8:  I half agree with that. Right? And I, and I think there's a way to look at

101
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:11,145
Speaker 8:  this that is Apple saying what we need is somebody

102
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:14,785
Speaker 8:  who will ship the thing, right? And Yeah, but sort of tacit inside of that

103
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:18,665
Speaker 8:  is also saying like the Vision Pro and Siri are in

104
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:22,145
Speaker 8:  roughly the same stage, which I just don't think it Sure at all. Like the

105
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:25,905
Speaker 8:  Vision Pro is, is a fabulous piece of technology that

106
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:29,785
Speaker 8:  doesn't have anything to do. Siri is the opposite, right? Like

107
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:33,385
Speaker 8:  Siri is, is bursting with interesting use cases. It just sucks.

108
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:37,825
Speaker 8:  It's like the Vision Pro is like not a bad product, it's just sort of a

109
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:42,265
Speaker 8:  unnecessary one at the moment. Like there's no, it has no jobs to do

110
00:07:42,885 --> 00:07:45,865
Speaker 8:  and Siri is a bad product. And I think those are actually really different.

111
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:49,825
Speaker 8:  And I think for Apple to treat them as the same

112
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:53,105
Speaker 8:  thing, like important technology early in its lifecycle.

113
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:57,425
Speaker 8:  Totally, totally not true. In AI's case, Siri is

114
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:01,585
Speaker 8:  14 years old. Yeah. And sucks. That is not the same thing as the Vision Pro.

115
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:02,465
Speaker 8:  It just isn't.

116
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:05,385
Speaker 7:  Sure. Okay. I I grant you all that. I agree with all of that for the sake

117
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:08,505
Speaker 7:  of the argument, my response is

118
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:13,305
Speaker 7:  the Vision Pro shipped for no reason. Like the error

119
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:17,265
Speaker 7:  in judgment Yes. Was saying we can't figure

120
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:21,265
Speaker 7:  out true AR glasses, which, which is what we actually want. So we're

121
00:08:21,265 --> 00:08:25,185
Speaker 7:  gonna insist that this VR headset with video pass through

122
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,865
Speaker 7:  that can be effectively defeated by low light

123
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,915
Speaker 7:  is good enough to achieve our vision of mixed reality. And then app developers

124
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:36,755
Speaker 7:  will flock to us and then when we get to where we're going and we

125
00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:40,635
Speaker 7:  make real AR glasses, the ecosystem will exist. None. None,

126
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:42,235
Speaker 7:  none of those were the right decisions,

127
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:42,995
Speaker 8:  Right.

128
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:45,355
Speaker 7:  That that's the thing that I'm focused on. And it's

129
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:49,275
Speaker 8:  The developers will save us thing that I think might be the trap Apple

130
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:53,235
Speaker 8:  is about to run into with Siri because as, as we've talked about many

131
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:57,205
Speaker 8:  times, this whole promise of Siri is like the the app intent machine that

132
00:08:57,205 --> 00:09:01,125
Speaker 8:  can go use your phone on your behalf. That depends on developers.

133
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:04,685
Speaker 8:  And so if you're looking at Apple as essentially a company that just makes

134
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:08,485
Speaker 8:  screens for developers to do stuff on, like that's increasingly what these

135
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,525
Speaker 8:  things are. They're like, here's a chip and a screen. You figure out what

136
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:11,325
Speaker 8:  it's for and

137
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:13,605
Speaker 7:  Pay us 30% anytime someone pushes a button,

138
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:17,525
Speaker 8:  Right? That is like increasingly the story of Apple as a hardware maker.

139
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:22,045
Speaker 8:  If you take that same approach to Siri and you say, okay, what we need to

140
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:25,125
Speaker 8:  do is just get a working version of this out the door and then developers

141
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,245
Speaker 8:  will figure out how to make it great.

142
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:31,895
Speaker 8:  That man that way lies, dragons and madness

143
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:35,975
Speaker 8:  and disaster. But you, but I agree. You can see how,

144
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:39,855
Speaker 8:  you can see how Apple would get there in that thought process of like, what

145
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:41,975
Speaker 8:  we need to do is put this in front of the people who will figure out what

146
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:44,975
Speaker 8:  to do with it. And it didn't work for the Vision Pro and I don't think it'll

147
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:45,535
Speaker 8:  work for Siri.

148
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:49,475
Speaker 7:  The, the big problem is that they very

149
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:53,185
Speaker 7:  foolishly announced the product that they wanted to make.

150
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:57,125
Speaker 7:  Right? Right. They showed the concept video wwc, then they've had to delay

151
00:09:57,225 --> 00:10:00,605
Speaker 7:  the, the delivery of the, the product that they showed off in the concept

152
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:03,365
Speaker 7:  video. So any pivot off of that now

153
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:08,505
Speaker 7:  requires them to further eat Crow. Not only is it delayed, but we, we changed

154
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:12,345
Speaker 7:  it or reduce the specs or Right. It'll be different in some meaningful way.

155
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,985
Speaker 7:  And then on top of that, they have to solve what I keep calling the DoorDash

156
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:20,905
Speaker 7:  problem, which is they have to get the app developers to basically hand

157
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:24,585
Speaker 7:  their customers away to the robot. 'cause the, the promise here with app

158
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:27,665
Speaker 7:  intents and all this, it's still the agents, like everybody else is talking

159
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:31,425
Speaker 7:  about agents, but instead of clicking around on a website, Siri will use

160
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:35,245
Speaker 7:  the apps on your phone for you. Right. And all of those app developers have

161
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:39,085
Speaker 7:  to be okay with their apps not being opened. IIII

162
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:40,965
Speaker 7:  still dunno how any of that works, right?

163
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:45,565
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I mean you could, you could trace a lot of the

164
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:49,645
Speaker 8:  design of iOS in particular over the last 15 years as

165
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:53,565
Speaker 8:  aggressively creating more reasons for you to open apps

166
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:58,245
Speaker 8:  and like, is that the wrong direction for technology to have

167
00:10:58,245 --> 00:11:00,965
Speaker 8:  gone? Yeah, probably from a user experience. But like

168
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:05,405
Speaker 8:  everything is about giving you more surfaces to show you company

169
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:08,525
Speaker 8:  logos. Like we were talking about this at the DY dynamic island last week,

170
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:11,405
Speaker 8:  right? Like one of the reasons developers like It is because now when I'm

171
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,365
Speaker 8:  on my home screen, it's still showing me the Uber icon. And like that's,

172
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:18,285
Speaker 8:  that's very powerful. And Siri promises, I think for

173
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:22,125
Speaker 8:  good user experience reasons, but terrible like economy

174
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:25,925
Speaker 8:  of the internet reasons to just abstract all of that away. So Apple has

175
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,805
Speaker 8:  to get them on board for this increasingly high risk

176
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:33,365
Speaker 8:  thing, both because it's bad technology and because it's bad business.

177
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,255
Speaker 8:  I just, I I don't see

178
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:40,175
Speaker 7:  It. Maybe, maybe John and Andrea just like pieced out. He

179
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:41,415
Speaker 7:  was like, you do it Vision Pro guy,

180
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:45,685
Speaker 8:  Mr. Vision Pro over here. He's

181
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:46,045
Speaker 7:  He's

182
00:11:49,365 --> 00:11:50,045
Speaker 7:  drinking outta cups.

183
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:53,485
Speaker 7:  That's a deep cut reference. I was gonna

184
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:55,365
Speaker 8:  Say, I wonder what percentage of this audience got that?

185
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:58,685
Speaker 7:  Not my share, not my problem. If you get that, send us a note. Yes, please.

186
00:11:58,875 --> 00:11:59,805
Speaker 7:  It's very important.

187
00:12:01,715 --> 00:12:05,245
Speaker 7:  It's, it's very important that we all know who we are. If you understand

188
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:05,685
Speaker 7:  that reference,

189
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:11,465
Speaker 7:  it's, It is notable that the guy Apple hired from

190
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:15,385
Speaker 7:  Google to run AI is no longer in charge of the, the

191
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:16,905
Speaker 7:  thing that AI should do on the iPhone,

192
00:12:17,115 --> 00:12:17,945
Speaker 8:  Right? It

193
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,505
Speaker 7:  Is ai, there's a ai and we know that there's ai I know, right? There's machine

194
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:25,185
Speaker 7:  learning and neural engines all through the phone and everyone's always excited

195
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:29,025
Speaker 7:  about the neural engine cores. But the distribution, the reason no one was

196
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:32,945
Speaker 7:  worried about Apple is that they had Siri ready to be plugged into

197
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:36,385
Speaker 7:  these systems that people like to use and that appears to have landed them

198
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:37,105
Speaker 7:  approximately nowhere.

199
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:39,585
Speaker 8:  Well, yeah, and it's, it's a really interesting

200
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:44,785
Speaker 8:  way of thinking about Apple too, because like Craig Federighi has

201
00:12:45,145 --> 00:12:49,105
Speaker 8:  a a long standing reputation of like building software that people like,

202
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:52,345
Speaker 8:  he has good hair and they ship a lot of software.

203
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:56,865
Speaker 8:  And so now thinking of Siri as like not this sort

204
00:12:56,865 --> 00:13:00,585
Speaker 8:  of many tentacle thing that exists a across your whole phone, which is what

205
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:03,025
Speaker 8:  Apple talked about Siri for a long time. They're like, Siri is not just an

206
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:06,905
Speaker 8:  assistant, sir, is everything Siri, the friends we made along the,

207
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:10,705
Speaker 8:  like, it's the whole thing. And and increasingly

208
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:13,705
Speaker 8:  it's like, no, maybe, maybe what you need is an app that works. Like maybe

209
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:16,945
Speaker 8:  you should think about Siri as just like an an app on your phone that is

210
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:17,625
Speaker 8:  good at things

211
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:21,465
Speaker 7:  We'll see might work. This is breaking news. Yeah. You heard us react to

212
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:25,095
Speaker 7:  it in real time. We'll, we'll see. In the meantime,

213
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:28,535
Speaker 7:  everyone gets a free Vision Pro if you use Siri. That's what I'm taking away

214
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:32,335
Speaker 7:  from the Snap. They gotta move units. Other big tech news of the week,

215
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:35,375
Speaker 7:  the new pebble smartwatches are are out or they're coming later this year.

216
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:39,815
Speaker 7:  David, you talked to Eric Micki, the CEO of Pebble. This is

217
00:13:39,815 --> 00:13:43,455
Speaker 7:  like pretty fortuitous timing to be launching a smartwatch brand for a variety

218
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,415
Speaker 7:  of reasons. What's going on there?

219
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:48,055
Speaker 8:  So it's very funny because Eric Micki, you might remember

220
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:52,575
Speaker 8:  before he was doing Pebble 2.0, which is

221
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:55,975
Speaker 8:  technically a company called Core Devices, but it's just Pebble again, like

222
00:13:55,975 --> 00:13:57,335
Speaker 8:  let's just all just be honest with each other.

223
00:13:57,815 --> 00:14:01,055
Speaker 7:  I do love that one of the watches is called the Core two Duo. It's one of

224
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:03,055
Speaker 7:  the funniest names in the entire world. It's

225
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:05,295
Speaker 8:  So funny. I asked him about this, we were talking about it and I was like,

226
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:08,295
Speaker 8:  and I was looking at, at the little screenshot that he sent me that said

227
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:11,455
Speaker 8:  Core two Duo. And I was like, isn't Intel gonna sue you? And he was like,

228
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,575
Speaker 8:  eh, it's a watch, not a chip. It'll be fine. I was like, Eric, I don't, I

229
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:16,535
Speaker 8:  dunno if you understand how this works, but,

230
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:22,175
Speaker 8:  but yeah. So he, before he started doing the Pebble

231
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:25,935
Speaker 8:  thing again, made a company called Beeper that got

232
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:29,735
Speaker 8:  into a big giant fight with Apple because he felt that

233
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:33,615
Speaker 8:  he should be allowed to interact with the iMessage protocol with a

234
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:37,255
Speaker 8:  third party app. And Apple did not agree with that

235
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:39,495
Speaker 8:  sentiment and it became a whole thing. And we talked about it a lot on this

236
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:43,415
Speaker 8:  show. And he, you know, very loudly proclaimed

237
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:46,055
Speaker 8:  that it was about freedom on the internet and all this stuff. And that was

238
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:49,815
Speaker 8:  all well and good. And he's now a little bit picking that same fight from

239
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:53,685
Speaker 8:  a different direction. So there's two new watches which are

240
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:57,485
Speaker 8:  in virtually every way identical to the

241
00:14:57,795 --> 00:15:01,565
Speaker 8:  last generation of Pebble watches. So there was the Pebble two and the Pebble

242
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:05,445
Speaker 8:  Time two, one has a black and white

243
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:09,205
Speaker 8:  ePaper screen, one has a color

244
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:13,485
Speaker 8:  ePaper screen, but they're very simple, right? They're, they're designed

245
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:17,365
Speaker 8:  to be sort of pixely and hackable and, and they're like gadgets. And

246
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:21,205
Speaker 8:  I mean that in the most gadgety possible way. And Eric's whole theory,

247
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:23,565
Speaker 8:  he, he has said this to me since we first started talking about this project,

248
00:15:23,665 --> 00:15:27,565
Speaker 8:  his whole theory is that actually the Pebble kind of

249
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:31,525
Speaker 8:  had it right. And what he wants is not some like brand new spin

250
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:35,325
Speaker 8:  on a minimalist smartwatch. He wants a pebble. And so he's like, he's rich

251
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:38,325
Speaker 8:  now. He's sold two companies. And so he's like, whatever, maybe I'm the only

252
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:41,175
Speaker 8:  one who wants this. I'm gonna go make a bunch more of them. And that's where

253
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:44,135
Speaker 8:  we are. So yeah, so there's the core two duo, which is

254
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:48,295
Speaker 8:  150 bucks and is the like very basic one. And the part of

255
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:52,255
Speaker 8:  that story I liked is there was some factory somewhere. He wouldn't

256
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:56,015
Speaker 8:  tell me exactly where that literally just had boxes full of pebble, two

257
00:15:56,355 --> 00:16:00,215
Speaker 8:  frames just, just sitting there just like in the warehouse

258
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:03,215
Speaker 8:  somewhere. So they're just using those, they're literally just making

259
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:08,095
Speaker 8:  watches out of those frames again. And

260
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:11,935
Speaker 8:  then so that one's shipping in July and they're basically like, they're using

261
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:16,095
Speaker 8:  old hardware, new sensors, which is one of the funny

262
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:18,495
Speaker 8:  things about this. I thought you would enjoy this in particular actually,

263
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:22,095
Speaker 8:  one of the things that he found in working on these watches again was that

264
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:26,175
Speaker 8:  just by virtue of how much more efficient Bluetooth has

265
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:29,935
Speaker 8:  gotten in the eight years since they last made Pebbles, they have quadrupled

266
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:33,215
Speaker 8:  the battery life of the pebble. And he said it's lots of things, like everything

267
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:35,895
Speaker 8:  has gotten more efficient and stuff. But he pointed to Bluetooth specifically

268
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:39,775
Speaker 8:  as like, It is so much better that the battery life on these new devices

269
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:43,455
Speaker 8:  goes from seven days to 30 without any other meaningful

270
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:47,415
Speaker 8:  change. That's amazing. Bluetooth man, 2025.

271
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:51,095
Speaker 8:  It is the year of Bluetooth. We're doing it finally out better. So yeah.

272
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:54,575
Speaker 8:  And then the other one is the core time two,

273
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:58,735
Speaker 8:  which is just the pebble time. Two with some of the same upgrades

274
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,135
Speaker 8:  and they're pre-selling them. Now that one's coming out in December and it's

275
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:05,815
Speaker 8:  230 bucks. But I kind of love this as an approach.

276
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:09,655
Speaker 8:  He's just like, he's just like, we did it. We made pebbles, they were cool

277
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:12,935
Speaker 8:  and here we are. But also along with all of that,

278
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:17,505
Speaker 8:  he published a blog post angrily describing why

279
00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:21,145
Speaker 8:  trying to use a pebble with an iPhone is so much worse than trying to use

280
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:25,105
Speaker 8:  a pebble with an Android phone. And this gets to, I think what you were talking

281
00:17:25,105 --> 00:17:29,065
Speaker 8:  about with the fortuitous timing of it all. Eric is very interested

282
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:32,305
Speaker 8:  in picking a fight with Apple again about the openness of its platforms.

283
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:36,865
Speaker 8:  And as it turns out, so is the eu. Yeah. Which I think like

284
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:40,945
Speaker 8:  with within the like 48 hour period, was it

285
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:44,145
Speaker 8:  the same day? It might have even been the same day right on top of each other.

286
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:48,105
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Okay. Put out two different decisions

287
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:52,605
Speaker 8:  or under the, the, was it the DMA, the digital market tax

288
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,205
Speaker 7:  D. Yeah. It's hard to keep. Look, we're not

289
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,085
Speaker 8:  Your European, there's so many acronyms.

290
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:59,405
Speaker 7:  All I can tell you what every version of Ford F-150

291
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:03,325
Speaker 7:  pickup truck look like. I'm, I'm trying hard to keep European tech

292
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:06,765
Speaker 7:  regulation straight. All right. Like cut me some slack. Yeah, there's the

293
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:10,685
Speaker 7:  DSA, which is the Digital Services Act, which meta and a bunch of

294
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:13,805
Speaker 7:  other companies are super pissed about, right? And then there's the Digital

295
00:18:13,805 --> 00:18:17,205
Speaker 7:  Markets Act, the DMA, which regulates gatekeepers

296
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:21,325
Speaker 7:  and preserves access to markets. So inside of the DMA, the Digital Markets

297
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:24,405
Speaker 7:  Act, apple is a gatekeeper and they are

298
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:29,365
Speaker 7:  requirements to open their platforms in various ways so that there

299
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:32,925
Speaker 7:  can be a functional market for things like smartwatches. And the two decisions

300
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:36,685
Speaker 7:  that came out just this last week under the DMA are exactly

301
00:18:36,945 --> 00:18:40,785
Speaker 7:  how in particular smartwatches need to interoperate with

302
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:41,145
Speaker 7:  iOS.

303
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:45,545
Speaker 8:  Okay. Yeah. And the, the one is essentially Apple

304
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,025
Speaker 8:  is now required to give developers more access

305
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:53,545
Speaker 8:  to some of the iPhone's features, right? So that like that other

306
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:57,425
Speaker 8:  watches will be able to do things like seamlessly pair or

307
00:18:57,565 --> 00:19:01,025
Speaker 8:  get notifications or share data back and forth in the same way that the Apple

308
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:04,945
Speaker 8:  Watch can. And then the other one, I think It is

309
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:08,305
Speaker 8:  basically just transparency, right? It's just like explaining to developers

310
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:10,705
Speaker 8:  how these systems work and how they can use them. Apple

311
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:12,225
Speaker 7:  Hates this, by the way, just to be hundred

312
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:15,825
Speaker 8:  Percent. Yeah. I mean Apple's whole thing increasingly is that

313
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:20,065
Speaker 8:  the, it's stuff only works properly if you buy all of its stuff.

314
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:24,145
Speaker 8:  And like, it's been really interesting to watch Android follow

315
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:27,545
Speaker 8:  that stuff up in slightly more open ways. Like the Android fast payer system

316
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:31,385
Speaker 8:  is now very good and it's only good on iOS if you use

317
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:35,225
Speaker 8:  Apple or Beats headphones. And so the EU is trying to

318
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:39,185
Speaker 8:  pry all of that open and be like, no, you can't privilege your own devices

319
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:43,305
Speaker 8:  in your ecosystem. That's the whole point. We are opening this up. And so

320
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:47,035
Speaker 8:  like, yeah, Apple's, the whole reason to buy an Apple watch is because you

321
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:50,835
Speaker 8:  have an iPhone, right? Like that's, that's it. Because everything else is

322
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:51,955
Speaker 8:  trash if you have an iPhone,

323
00:19:52,095 --> 00:19:55,795
Speaker 7:  But there's no market for other smart watches. Right? I think if you're a

324
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,955
Speaker 7:  gadget fan listening to shit, that's kind of a, it's, it's sad. It's just

325
00:19:58,975 --> 00:20:02,595
Speaker 7:  sad. Yeah. It's sad that you don't think about like, what other smartwatch

326
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:06,155
Speaker 7:  could I buy? You're like, I can only have this one because I can only send

327
00:20:06,155 --> 00:20:09,395
Speaker 7:  an iMessage in return on this one. Right. And you can't even do any other

328
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:12,355
Speaker 7:  kind of interactivity with a pebble, which is the point of Eric's blog post.

329
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:15,315
Speaker 7:  Right? They're, they're locked down in certain ways. By the way, when I say

330
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:20,145
Speaker 7:  that Apple hates this, here's the statement

331
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:23,745
Speaker 7:  from the EU with these decisions, we are simply

332
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:26,865
Speaker 7:  implementing the law and providing regulatory certainty to both Apple and

333
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:29,985
Speaker 7:  to developers. Effective interoperability for third party connected devices

334
00:20:29,985 --> 00:20:33,425
Speaker 7:  is an important step towards opening Apple apple's ecosystem. This will lead

335
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:36,745
Speaker 7:  to better choice for consumers and the fast gray market for innovative connected

336
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:40,305
Speaker 7:  devices. This is a total boilerplate. Sure. Here's Apple's response.

337
00:20:42,055 --> 00:20:45,265
Speaker 7:  This is all in our story. You can, you can go read it. Today's decisions

338
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:49,125
Speaker 7:  wrap us in red tape. Slowing down Apple's ability to innovate for users in

339
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,965
Speaker 7:  Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies

340
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:56,005
Speaker 7:  who don't have to pay play by the same rules. It's bad for our products and

341
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,605
Speaker 7:  for our European users. We'll continue to work with the European Commission

342
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:03,165
Speaker 7:  to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.

343
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:04,085
Speaker 7:  Brutal

344
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:04,565
Speaker 8:  Furious.

345
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:05,125
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

346
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:05,765
Speaker 8:  That's

347
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:06,365
Speaker 7:  Fury.

348
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:10,525
Speaker 8:  There's also a real, like we're just gonna take our ball

349
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:14,005
Speaker 8:  and go home thing inside of that. Like this, this Sapen made me think of

350
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:17,925
Speaker 8:  in sort of a weird tangential way what Mark Zuckerberg always used to

351
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:21,845
Speaker 8:  say about content moderation. Where he was basically like, we invest

352
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:25,605
Speaker 8:  the most, we try the hardest, we do the most, we spend the most money

353
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:29,405
Speaker 8:  and all being this loud and transparent about it gets us

354
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:31,605
Speaker 8:  is pain. So we're just gonna stop.

355
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:33,045
Speaker 7:  And they totally stopped and

356
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:36,325
Speaker 8:  Then they stopped and, and this is like this to me is Apple being like, oh

357
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:38,965
Speaker 8:  well we've built all these cool features to make our devices work together

358
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:41,325
Speaker 8:  and now you're forcing us to give them to other people. Maybe we'll just

359
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:41,565
Speaker 8:  stop.

360
00:21:42,105 --> 00:21:45,365
Speaker 7:  It would be amazing if they stopped selling the Apple watch in Europe. They're

361
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:47,165
Speaker 7:  like, fine have this weird pebble. The

362
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:51,125
Speaker 8:  Threat here is seems to be less that and more the

363
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:55,045
Speaker 8:  next time we think about inventing a cool fast pairing feature, we just

364
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:57,725
Speaker 8:  won't because we'll have to give it away. Like, we're gonna make our products

365
00:21:57,725 --> 00:22:01,685
Speaker 8:  worse because any cool thing we do we're gonna

366
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:04,765
Speaker 8:  have to give away is like, that feels like the threat to me. And that is

367
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:08,645
Speaker 8:  a bummer. But I also think is a non crazy threat from a company like

368
00:22:08,645 --> 00:22:08,845
Speaker 8:  Apple.

369
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:12,705
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Well we'll see how these things play out. The, in some cases

370
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:15,665
Speaker 7:  they've played out the way we kind of thought they would.

371
00:22:16,945 --> 00:22:20,015
Speaker 7:  Right? Europe forces Apple to do alternative app stores,

372
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:25,415
Speaker 7:  emulators show up. Apple immediately caves on letting emulators into

373
00:22:25,415 --> 00:22:29,295
Speaker 7:  the real app store or the, the Apple App store. I should, I should say not

374
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:30,215
Speaker 7:  the real, I mean

375
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:32,735
Speaker 8:  The fact that it's called the Real app store is kind of the point, right?

376
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:34,735
Speaker 8:  Like that is, that is still where we are. So

377
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:38,615
Speaker 7:  You just see some a a little dash of competitive pressure actually forced

378
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:42,135
Speaker 7:  Apple to respond within consumers who wanted forever. Right. If that's how

379
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:46,075
Speaker 7:  it plays out in smartwatches, that's probably good. Yeah.

380
00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:50,325
Speaker 7:  If it plays out that Apple is just like, screw it. No more Apple Watch

381
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:54,325
Speaker 7:  features. Well they still have a monopoly on the apple. It's like it,

382
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:56,765
Speaker 7:  there's just, I, I don't know how that one will play out, but you can see

383
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,965
Speaker 7:  the fury it being made to compete and then when, when

384
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:04,565
Speaker 7:  there is real competition or something that sniffs like competition, you

385
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:06,005
Speaker 7:  can see them cave like they did with emulators.

386
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:10,005
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Well and you can also tell the EU is learning how this game is played

387
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:13,485
Speaker 8:  because the, not just the fact that it decreed that this stuff has to happen

388
00:23:13,905 --> 00:23:17,645
Speaker 8:  but actually expressly dictated to Apple. No, you have to tell

389
00:23:17,645 --> 00:23:20,765
Speaker 8:  developers how to do it. Yeah. Give them a timeline for how it's supposed

390
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:23,845
Speaker 8:  to work and review these things in a predictable and timely way. It's like

391
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:27,525
Speaker 8:  the EU and Apple are just slowly learning each other's games and are just

392
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:30,805
Speaker 8:  like constantly trying to fend each other's off from being insane. And I

393
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:31,845
Speaker 8:  really enjoy it. I

394
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:34,645
Speaker 7:  Will say, just looking at this, the idea that

395
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:40,545
Speaker 7:  giving third party smartwatches the ability to pair

396
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:44,225
Speaker 7:  transfer data or display notifications or take action on them is not like

397
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:48,155
Speaker 7:  the most innovative technology in the world. You guys like, you know

398
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:50,115
Speaker 7:  what I mean? But It is, It is

399
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,115
Speaker 8:  The most

400
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:56,035
Speaker 8:  important thing about the Apple Watch, right? Like the, the difference between

401
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:59,555
Speaker 8:  the Apple Watch and any other watch is if I get a text I can

402
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:03,155
Speaker 8:  respond to it from my Apple watch and I can't respond to it from any other

403
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:06,995
Speaker 8:  smart watch, which is just immediately a crushing blow to

404
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:08,235
Speaker 8:  anyone who wants to compete with Apple

405
00:24:08,575 --> 00:24:10,435
Speaker 7:  And which is why there's no market for, right.

406
00:24:10,435 --> 00:24:10,755
Speaker 8:  Right.

407
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:14,435
Speaker 7:  Anyhow, we'll see, I hope Apple does well. We gotta get these things. We'll

408
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:17,635
Speaker 7:  see if the, you know, the passage of time has made Bluetooth better.

409
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:23,475
Speaker 7:  Sure, I believe you. But It is, It is, it's

410
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:26,955
Speaker 7:  well timed that they're launching new smartwatch and then maybe they will

411
00:24:26,955 --> 00:24:30,875
Speaker 7:  be able to better compete, at least in Europe with iOS users, they can already

412
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,315
Speaker 7:  do all this stuff with Android. Right?

413
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:36,675
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Android has been more open in that way for a long time

414
00:24:36,735 --> 00:24:40,075
Speaker 8:  and I think all that stuff will still work. Eric very proudly told me that

415
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:44,035
Speaker 8:  you can still side load the original Pebble app and it'll still work on an

416
00:24:44,035 --> 00:24:47,155
Speaker 8:  Android phone. And I was like, cool Eric. I bet a lot of people are doing

417
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:47,355
Speaker 8:  that.

418
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:48,475
Speaker 7:  That's our audience.

419
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:49,475
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I mean

420
00:24:49,475 --> 00:24:52,475
Speaker 7:  That's true. They're, they're here for it. Speaking of Android little Pixel

421
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:55,115
Speaker 7:  news this week, not like major Pixel news, but some weirdness in here. The

422
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:57,715
Speaker 7:  Pixel nine A is out. What's going on with that thing? So

423
00:24:58,235 --> 00:25:02,195
Speaker 8:  I, I actually kind of think the nine A is a big deal. I think

424
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:05,875
Speaker 8:  the, a line of phones gets less credit than it

425
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:09,795
Speaker 8:  deserves where it's basically like Google just showing up

426
00:25:09,795 --> 00:25:13,595
Speaker 8:  and being like, okay, we've now figured out how to make the last

427
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:17,555
Speaker 8:  phone that we made and it's a little cheaper now 'cause we, we've made lots

428
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:20,715
Speaker 8:  of them. That's all good. So we're just gonna basically do that. But like

429
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:23,235
Speaker 8:  at half the price, is that something you're interested in and like Yeah,

430
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:27,035
Speaker 8:  It is. This is the Google has done this mid-range phone,

431
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:31,035
Speaker 8:  I think actually substantially better than Apple and

432
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:34,795
Speaker 8:  Alison Johnson who wrote about the, the nine A made this point very well.

433
00:25:34,895 --> 00:25:37,515
Speaker 8:  The, the 16 e just came out from Apple.

434
00:25:39,235 --> 00:25:42,995
Speaker 8:  I I think we, we largely think it, It is a series of like pretty

435
00:25:42,995 --> 00:25:46,715
Speaker 8:  reasonable trade-offs except for maybe a couple, but at $699

436
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:50,115
Speaker 8:  it's still pretty expensive. Then Google shows up with the nine A and it's

437
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,955
Speaker 8:  like, okay, it has multiple cameras. 6.3 inch screen looks pretty

438
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:57,595
Speaker 8:  nice. It actually doesn't have a camera bump, which in general

439
00:25:57,775 --> 00:26:00,435
Speaker 8:  I'm of the mind of like, who cares about camera bumps? Everybody puts cases

440
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:03,715
Speaker 8:  on. But then I see a picture of this one where it doesn't have a camera bump

441
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:06,195
Speaker 8:  and I'm like, yeah, that's, that's kind of slick. Like I'm, I'm kind of into

442
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:06,315
Speaker 8:  it.

443
00:26:07,825 --> 00:26:11,515
Speaker 8:  It's more durable than the last one. It's brighter than the last one. It

444
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:12,755
Speaker 8:  is a bigger battery than the last one.

445
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:17,755
Speaker 8:  Slightly smaller camera sensor, which I have a lot of questions about.

446
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:22,875
Speaker 8:  All of Google's million weird new ideas about ai.

447
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:27,755
Speaker 8:  Sure. 499 bucks. This is a good deal. Like this

448
00:26:27,755 --> 00:26:31,715
Speaker 8:  is, I I think in the, in the lineup of Android

449
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,395
Speaker 8:  phones, I think the, the a series from Google

450
00:26:35,535 --> 00:26:39,075
Speaker 8:  is actually one of the most compelling in terms of like actual bang for the

451
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:41,995
Speaker 8:  buck. Allison said in her piece that this is the phone she recommends for

452
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:45,485
Speaker 8:  dads and like a, I agree. And B,

453
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:48,765
Speaker 8:  as a dad I'm like, yeah, I'm, I'm into this phone. It is kind hard. That's

454
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:48,925
Speaker 8:  hilarious.

455
00:26:48,925 --> 00:26:52,885
Speaker 7:  That's hilarious. It's funny 'cause Samsung's Galaxy a line is also the other

456
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:56,865
Speaker 7:  cheap one that also moves a lot of units that every now and again

457
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,745
Speaker 7:  we're like, oh, we should pay attention to these. Like these are the ones,

458
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:03,185
Speaker 7:  so the A 35 5G is 3 9 9, so they're a little bit higher than that,

459
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,705
Speaker 7:  but it's a newer phone.

460
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:08,745
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And it's, it's, it, it all gets very complicated. So like

461
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:13,505
Speaker 8:  Anna, my wife dropped two to two phones and, and destroyed

462
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:16,905
Speaker 8:  them in the span of 48 hours, which is very impressive and true. Kudos to

463
00:27:16,905 --> 00:27:20,265
Speaker 8:  Anna and I ended up buying her a Pixel eight

464
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:24,625
Speaker 8:  at Best Buy for $399. And I did that knowing that the

465
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:28,105
Speaker 8:  nine A was probably coming soon. And I was like, the, the gap between

466
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:32,105
Speaker 8:  last year's flagship and this year's midrange is like kind of

467
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:35,345
Speaker 8:  vanishingly small. Which is weird because like

468
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:39,465
Speaker 8:  ordinarily this, this stuff either sort of lags a couple of generations or

469
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:44,065
Speaker 8:  there's some meaningful spec difference between them. But now it's like

470
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:47,985
Speaker 8:  there's just a lot of like same e phones and it's like whatever, any

471
00:27:47,985 --> 00:27:51,105
Speaker 8:  phone from the last two years at a price that makes sense for you is probably

472
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:54,505
Speaker 8:  going to be very good. Which is both an odd and a cool place to get in the

473
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:55,745
Speaker 8:  smartphone universe.

474
00:27:55,985 --> 00:27:59,425
Speaker 7:  I think particularly in pixel line. 'cause I mean the point of them is Google's

475
00:27:59,585 --> 00:28:02,945
Speaker 7:  software, right? At the, at the end of the day, the, the point of buying

476
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:04,985
Speaker 7:  a pixel is to run Google's vision of Android.

477
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:05,665
Speaker 8:  Right.

478
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,435
Speaker 7:  And that remains fairly constant among these phones.

479
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:13,555
Speaker 8:  Yes. You know, it doesn't remain constant is Google's ability to make hardware

480
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:14,675
Speaker 8:  that works. I

481
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:18,435
Speaker 7:  Would say that in a minor way. Constant. Yeah,

482
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:18,875
Speaker 7:  that's fair.

483
00:28:20,515 --> 00:28:24,475
Speaker 8:  Google's inability to make hard roast there works. Yeah. So yeah. Okay. I

484
00:28:24,595 --> 00:28:28,115
Speaker 8:  I wanna know what you make of this. So when Google announced the nine a,

485
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,515
Speaker 8:  they also told us, this is Matt Flagal at Google

486
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:36,355
Speaker 8:  who said, we're checking on a component quality issue that's affecting a

487
00:28:36,355 --> 00:28:39,835
Speaker 8:  small number of Pixel nine A devices. They haven't shipped review units,

488
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:43,675
Speaker 8:  at least as far as we know to anybody. You can't pre-order the phone and

489
00:28:43,745 --> 00:28:47,075
Speaker 8:  it's not coming out for a few more weeks. All of which are kind of unusual

490
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:49,155
Speaker 8:  for the way that Google tends to announce phones.

491
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:54,795
Speaker 8:  This sets off like all kinds of alarm bells for me. What do you, what do

492
00:28:54,795 --> 00:28:55,315
Speaker 8:  you make of this?

493
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:59,795
Speaker 7:  I think that they had their announced date locked and then they

494
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:02,715
Speaker 7:  realized the phones were broken and they were stuck

495
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:06,545
Speaker 7:  and they had to announce this phone and they have no idea when it's actually

496
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:10,155
Speaker 7:  gonna shut. It's weird to announce it without even a pre-order button.

497
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:14,155
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Well and to me it suggests that It is there, It is not

498
00:29:14,155 --> 00:29:16,715
Speaker 8:  something you can just fix with like a firmware push.

499
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:22,555
Speaker 8:  'cause what we've seen before is, you know, they'll, they'll ship

500
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:25,635
Speaker 8:  phones particularly to reviewers and be like, Hey, you know, in a few days

501
00:29:25,635 --> 00:29:29,235
Speaker 8:  you're, we're gonna get an update that fixes X, y, and Z thing. Which is

502
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:32,475
Speaker 8:  annoying as a reviewer, but as a relatively common thing for a phone right

503
00:29:32,475 --> 00:29:35,875
Speaker 8:  before it ships. But the fact that there

504
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:40,235
Speaker 8:  is no date, there is no button, no one has seen

505
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:44,125
Speaker 8:  these things suggest to me that even if it's a small number of phones, which

506
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:48,085
Speaker 8:  is what they always say, it's gotta be something pretty show

507
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,165
Speaker 8:  stopping, right?

508
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:52,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah. You've gotta, you've got something that makes the phone not work or

509
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:53,565
Speaker 7:  work. What? Those are your choices.

510
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,405
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Like, oh no, the 5G chip is broken. It's like I it's something, it's

511
00:29:57,405 --> 00:30:01,135
Speaker 8:  gotta be something at that level. Like, we forgot to make a phone that

512
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:03,855
Speaker 8:  connects to the internet. I, I dunno.

513
00:30:05,285 --> 00:30:08,495
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I mean it was, it's supposed to be here and it's, It is just not And

514
00:30:08,495 --> 00:30:11,985
Speaker 7:  there's no time. Right. They're not saying when, so

515
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:15,465
Speaker 7:  I, there's, there's weirdness with this one, but I, I suspect they, they

516
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:19,305
Speaker 7:  were locked into the state to announce the thing.

517
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,465
Speaker 7:  'cause Google also has to be nice to its entire ecosystem. Right.

518
00:30:24,045 --> 00:30:27,955
Speaker 7:  So it can't step on everybody else. Right. So for example, this was

519
00:30:27,955 --> 00:30:31,155
Speaker 7:  not announced at Mobile World Congress, which was just a few weeks ago. It's

520
00:30:31,155 --> 00:30:35,035
Speaker 7:  now. 'cause they, they let everyone else have their time. Weird. And so

521
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:37,755
Speaker 7:  like, that's just gonna keep happening. So I think they, they take their

522
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:41,175
Speaker 7:  window and let everyone else do what they want. Phone delayed means they,

523
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:42,015
Speaker 7:  they still have to hit their window.

524
00:30:42,565 --> 00:30:46,375
Speaker 8:  Yeah, that makes sense. And I'll say kudos to Google for actually taking

525
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:50,415
Speaker 8:  this route if there is a real problem. We've seen a lot of companies ship

526
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,495
Speaker 8:  slightly broken things with the promise of it'll be fixed later. The

527
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:56,215
Speaker 7:  AI will fix it, David. Yeah.

528
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:56,495
Speaker 8:  Right.

529
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:01,375
Speaker 8:  So at least for Google to be like, okay we, we are not going to sell you

530
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:05,335
Speaker 8:  this thing until we're confident that it won't break. It doesn't

531
00:31:05,335 --> 00:31:09,175
Speaker 8:  make me feel great about the quality of this phone or Google's

532
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:13,055
Speaker 8:  ongoing hardware team. But at least feels like Google doing the right

533
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:13,175
Speaker 8:  thing.

534
00:31:14,065 --> 00:31:17,195
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I just wish they had a date. Yeah. They weren't like we're delaying

535
00:31:17,195 --> 00:31:18,595
Speaker 7:  it by two weeks. They're just like, we're checking.

536
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:22,795
Speaker 8:  Yeah. A phone, a phone that launches without a release date should, like,

537
00:31:22,795 --> 00:31:26,315
Speaker 8:  technically the nine A is vaporware. The the nine like as of right now, the

538
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:27,475
Speaker 8:  pixel nine A is vaporware

539
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:29,035
Speaker 7:  $500 vaporware.

540
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,355
Speaker 8:  At least it's not $600. It's

541
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:33,835
Speaker 7:  Vapor till it ships. Those are the rules. Yeah. I don't, I don't make 'em,

542
00:31:33,835 --> 00:31:34,755
Speaker 7:  I mean I, I made that one

543
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:40,475
Speaker 7:  but it's bigger than me now. Yeah. So vapor till ships. No. How

544
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:43,835
Speaker 7:  mad. How mad you get. Okay, let's talk about my favorite piece of foam. Vaporware

545
00:31:46,425 --> 00:31:50,345
Speaker 7:  Huawei's Pure X, which one will not

546
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:53,985
Speaker 7:  ship here? Yeah, it's like a weird sort of geopolitical vapor

547
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,145
Speaker 7:  also. It's only a render right now. And then third of all,

548
00:31:58,295 --> 00:32:00,585
Speaker 7:  it's like a wide flip phone.

549
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,895
Speaker 7:  Like a very, it's a very like imagine a flip phone but then make it

550
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:06,935
Speaker 7:  really wide.

551
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:07,655
Speaker 8:  Make it sideways.

552
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:11,855
Speaker 7:  It's not even sideways. It, it, it, when it unfolds it's,

553
00:32:12,485 --> 00:32:16,375
Speaker 7:  it's still the wrong shape. I love it. It is, It is very

554
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:19,375
Speaker 7:  good. I want it very badly. This phone is

555
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:23,815
Speaker 8:  Thoroughly fascinating. It really is like a, it's

556
00:32:24,015 --> 00:32:27,855
Speaker 8:  I think Huawei's first phone with no Android app compatibility, it's like

557
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:31,695
Speaker 8:  full on harmony os they're, they

558
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:35,895
Speaker 8:  have had to do their own thing again because of geopolitical insanity.

559
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:40,865
Speaker 8:  And so this is, this is sort of the beginning of a

560
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:44,665
Speaker 8:  new era of Huawei trying to build its entire ecosystem for itself. Yeah.

561
00:32:44,665 --> 00:32:47,105
Speaker 7:  It's not even open source Android. It's it's new.

562
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:50,865
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It's a completely different operating system from the, from the ground

563
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,385
Speaker 8:  up. And I really appreciate that instead of being like, here's a phone you

564
00:32:54,385 --> 00:32:56,905
Speaker 8:  really like with new software, let's see how this goes. They're just like,

565
00:32:56,905 --> 00:33:00,025
Speaker 8:  what if we reinvented literally everything all at once?

566
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:04,345
Speaker 8:  This is also, I should say justice for the Surface

567
00:33:04,645 --> 00:33:08,515
Speaker 8:  Duo, which was the other bookish unfolding

568
00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:12,475
Speaker 8:  phone. That was a ridiculous idea that I nevertheless loved and used all

569
00:33:12,475 --> 00:33:12,675
Speaker 8:  the time.

570
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:16,675
Speaker 7:  No, but this one you, it's, it's wide but you

571
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:18,915
Speaker 7:  open it sideways and then you're supposed to rotate it.

572
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:20,145
Speaker 8:  It goes 90,

573
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:24,745
Speaker 7:  It goes 90. So you get this weird vertical tablet but

574
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:28,715
Speaker 7:  then you close it and you're supposed to use it sideways again. I don't understand

575
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:32,555
Speaker 7:  a piece of it. I just know that I love it. Yeah. And I wanna run Harmony

576
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:33,395
Speaker 7:  os next

577
00:33:35,405 --> 00:33:38,465
Speaker 7:  in Chinese I suppose if I have to, but I'm ready to go.

578
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:42,265
Speaker 8:  Do you remember that phone, the LG wing, the one with the sort of like

579
00:33:42,725 --> 00:33:46,665
Speaker 8:  the, with the, it opened up into like a T shape? Yeah. That, that's

580
00:33:46,665 --> 00:33:48,945
Speaker 8:  what this reminds me of. Where they're just like, we're, we're just going

581
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,785
Speaker 8:  to come up with every possible way you could use a phone and we're gonna

582
00:33:51,785 --> 00:33:55,465
Speaker 8:  make it slightly weird in every orientation. Like do you want that?

583
00:33:55,945 --> 00:33:59,905
Speaker 7:  I love it. I love the fact that it runs its own weird operating system

584
00:34:00,095 --> 00:34:04,065
Speaker 7:  that we basically China had to build 'cause of trade restrictions. And there's

585
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:07,865
Speaker 7:  its own weird AI system in there that even Jensen Wong. It is like, yeah,

586
00:34:07,865 --> 00:34:10,785
Speaker 7:  that's pretty good. Yeah. All right. If you wanna send us a weird Huawei

587
00:34:10,785 --> 00:34:13,665
Speaker 7:  phone, legally, illegally,

588
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:19,195
Speaker 8:  You know, if it arrives we'll we'll use it. I'll just say that

589
00:34:19,995 --> 00:34:22,475
Speaker 7:  Actually I think Dom Preston in the UK is probably gonna get this for us.

590
00:34:22,505 --> 00:34:26,355
Speaker 7:  Yeah, we'll find a way. But I'm excited about weird phone form factors

591
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:30,195
Speaker 7:  as always. Lastly in this segment we should talk about Nvidia a little bit.

592
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:33,955
Speaker 7:  They just had a big conference. It was GDC and Nvidia had GTC.

593
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:38,035
Speaker 7:  Jensen was on stage, made a lot of noise about chips. David,

594
00:34:38,135 --> 00:34:39,995
Speaker 7:  you said you had a theory here or

595
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:43,355
Speaker 8:  Hot. I do have a theory here. A I have a recommendation then a theory. The

596
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:47,315
Speaker 8:  recommendation is that everybody should go watch these Groot n

597
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:50,915
Speaker 8:  one humanoid robot videos. Yeah. Nvidia is putting out,

598
00:34:51,145 --> 00:34:55,035
Speaker 8:  they're wild. And I think we, we all have spent,

599
00:34:55,035 --> 00:34:58,955
Speaker 8:  what, 10 years seeing the Boston Dynamics videos where the, the robot

600
00:34:58,955 --> 00:35:02,115
Speaker 8:  that looks like a dog can do back flips and it's like, that's all, well this

601
00:35:02,115 --> 00:35:05,995
Speaker 8:  is like a whole other thing. This is like, we didn't write about

602
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:10,035
Speaker 8:  a demo we saw of these because we just assumed it was a person in a

603
00:35:10,035 --> 00:35:13,275
Speaker 8:  suit. Like that's, and I'm still not convinced

604
00:35:13,755 --> 00:35:16,635
Speaker 8:  that's not what's going on, but that's how convincing some of these demos

605
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:20,435
Speaker 8:  have gotten and they're really fascinating. But the theory I want to throw

606
00:35:20,435 --> 00:35:23,665
Speaker 8:  at you is I think Nvidia has stolen

607
00:35:24,295 --> 00:35:28,145
Speaker 8:  Apple's Thunder as the most important product launch

608
00:35:28,535 --> 00:35:32,385
Speaker 8:  company right now, which is bonkers for a

609
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:35,305
Speaker 8:  company that mostly announces chips. But in terms of like,

610
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,845
Speaker 8:  I, I don't think you, you're gonna tell me it hasn't hit the, like they cover

611
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:43,325
Speaker 8:  it on the local news thing and that's true, but in terms of like people who

612
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:47,005
Speaker 8:  care about technology, there is so much enthusiasm now around

613
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:50,485
Speaker 8:  everything that Nvidia does. And they have these things in like

614
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:54,205
Speaker 8:  stadiums with thousands of people. And it's this huge personal

615
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:57,605
Speaker 8:  event in a way that Apple now just like releases infomercials. Which I think

616
00:35:57,605 --> 00:36:01,445
Speaker 8:  has sort of hurt the excitement of those announcements. But Nvidia

617
00:36:01,465 --> 00:36:05,315
Speaker 8:  is like deeply like sexy and cool in a way

618
00:36:05,315 --> 00:36:08,515
Speaker 8:  that I think Apple used to be when it talked about new products.

619
00:36:09,095 --> 00:36:12,275
Speaker 7:  Yes, I agree with this. I also think that

620
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:16,165
Speaker 7:  it's a small community of people like

621
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:20,125
Speaker 7:  who really care about it. And then there's like a lot of people who own Invis

622
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:21,885
Speaker 7:  Nvidia stock who wanna see number go up.

623
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:26,165
Speaker 8:  That's fair. And what I wonder about this is, do you think until

624
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:30,005
Speaker 8:  Nvidia starts making itself some kind of like mainstream

625
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:34,285
Speaker 8:  hardware, can it ever be that cool mostly as a chip

626
00:36:34,445 --> 00:36:38,245
Speaker 8:  maker? 'cause I look at these things in like the, the, what was it,

627
00:36:38,245 --> 00:36:42,205
Speaker 8:  project Digits is now the spark, this little like AI supercomputer thing

628
00:36:42,205 --> 00:36:45,845
Speaker 8:  that they're making. And I'm like there, there's a world here where Nvidia

629
00:36:45,845 --> 00:36:49,205
Speaker 8:  like really wants to make a consumer product that people care about to get

630
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:51,325
Speaker 8:  that next level of like interest and excitement.

631
00:36:53,395 --> 00:36:56,255
Speaker 7:  But then all, all their money is in data centers. I think their consumer

632
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,935
Speaker 7:  product is chat GPT. That's fair. You know what I mean? Like yeah.

633
00:36:59,945 --> 00:37:03,735
Speaker 7:  Their consumer product is gr or whatever else is running a bunch of Nvidia

634
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:07,535
Speaker 7:  chips in data center. Like they're happy with that. The the comparison that

635
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:11,335
Speaker 7:  I would make to you is Intel, which just as week got a new CEO who's

636
00:37:11,335 --> 00:37:15,295
Speaker 7:  gonna try harder I suppose. But Intel's years in the

637
00:37:15,295 --> 00:37:19,015
Speaker 7:  woods were marked. Like I, we knew the end was coming for

638
00:37:19,015 --> 00:37:22,335
Speaker 7:  Intel 'cause they didn't do the iPhone. They were bad at mobile. And then

639
00:37:22,335 --> 00:37:25,295
Speaker 7:  every year we would go to CES or whatever and Intel would be like, here's

640
00:37:25,295 --> 00:37:28,295
Speaker 7:  a vision of the future powered by Intel chips. Andd be like, are you gonna

641
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:31,895
Speaker 7:  make any of this stuff? And they're like, no, that would be the end of it.

642
00:37:31,895 --> 00:37:34,935
Speaker 7:  Right? Like every time it would be the end of it. And they couldn't make

643
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:37,215
Speaker 7:  the leap to being a consumer company 'cause they don't think that's in their

644
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:41,135
Speaker 7:  DNA at all. And then nobody wanted what they were selling. Like

645
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:44,535
Speaker 7:  quite literally nobody wanted what they were selling. And so you, you ended

646
00:37:44,535 --> 00:37:47,375
Speaker 7:  up at a place where it's like, I saw the future of

647
00:37:47,635 --> 00:37:50,255
Speaker 7:  10,000 drone firework shows.

648
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:56,175
Speaker 7:  That's Intel's future. That's what they were showing for years. 'cause they

649
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:59,775
Speaker 7:  had the technology to make that stuff, but that wasn't the next turn. I don't

650
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:03,095
Speaker 7:  think Nvidia wants to be in that place where they're like, here's a vision

651
00:38:03,095 --> 00:38:04,655
Speaker 7:  of what you might build with our stuff. There are

652
00:38:04,655 --> 00:38:08,565
Speaker 8:  Like small hints that it does though. There's like

653
00:38:08,825 --> 00:38:12,685
Speaker 8:  the, the Shield is a consumer, a weird consumer product, but consumer product

654
00:38:12,685 --> 00:38:16,285
Speaker 8:  and they're like doing the GForce thing and and they have the, the Digits

655
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:20,045
Speaker 8:  of, it's like there are, it seems like there is like one executive

656
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:23,325
Speaker 8:  inside of Nvidia who's like, what if we made the products ourselves and they

657
00:38:23,325 --> 00:38:25,885
Speaker 8:  keep losing the fight in the meetings. But then,

658
00:38:27,245 --> 00:38:28,285
Speaker 8:  I don't know, it just feels like

659
00:38:28,545 --> 00:38:31,325
Speaker 7:  That's, well first of all, the Nvidia Shield hasn't been revved in 500 years.

660
00:38:31,385 --> 00:38:34,085
Speaker 7:  And I know by, even by talking about it, we've summoned the Nvidia Shield

661
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:35,390
Speaker 8:  People. Yeah. We're getting good. Get emails

662
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:39,125
Speaker 7:  Welcome. You know, we, we love you. You're safe here.

663
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:44,225
Speaker 7:  It's, it's old. I'm just letting you know it's old. It was always a little

664
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:46,905
Speaker 7:  bit crankier than any of you wanted do to, to admit

665
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,905
Speaker 7:  also you have to, the plex just changed its rates. I don't know what you

666
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:54,625
Speaker 7:  all are gonna do now. They're increasing prices. It's stuff out there.

667
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:58,545
Speaker 7:  They're the big, big news. I I see that They wanted to package

668
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:02,505
Speaker 7:  some of their core technology in ways to indicate

669
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:05,705
Speaker 7:  like, oh, there's a real market here, but the shield was never gonna go after

670
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:09,525
Speaker 7:  the Roku. Right. Like that was Yeah. I was not gonna happen. And

671
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:12,845
Speaker 7:  I think it's the same. Like that's what I, that the intel comparison I'm

672
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:16,685
Speaker 7:  making is Intel kept trying to invent a new market because it had lost the

673
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:20,525
Speaker 7:  old one. Right. Whereas NVIDIA's, It is this market, right?

674
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:24,605
Speaker 7:  It literally, he's Jensen standing on stage

675
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:29,195
Speaker 7:  talking about the price performance ratio of inference on

676
00:39:29,295 --> 00:39:31,795
Speaker 7:  Nvidia GPUs and how no one can compete with him.

677
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:36,155
Speaker 8:  Right. And so maybe the fact that it has become such a huge event is

678
00:39:36,155 --> 00:39:39,995
Speaker 8:  less about how important Nvidia is and more about how

679
00:39:39,995 --> 00:39:42,235
Speaker 8:  much it owns that market that everyone is obsessed with.

680
00:39:42,545 --> 00:39:45,715
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And and I think the point he's making is you can't compete with us.

681
00:39:45,825 --> 00:39:46,235
Speaker 7:  Like it,

682
00:39:46,235 --> 00:39:49,235
Speaker 8:  It was like, what if, what if everyone on earth cared about laptops when

683
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:51,555
Speaker 8:  Intel was like at its peak?

684
00:39:51,945 --> 00:39:55,795
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And, and I and there's a lot of hype in ai. Yeah. So

685
00:39:55,835 --> 00:39:59,555
Speaker 7:  I, I just feel like there, it would be a, I think it would be a miss for

686
00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:02,675
Speaker 7:  Nvidia to be like, you can run the models locally. I think what Nvidia wants

687
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:06,635
Speaker 7:  most of all is for Amazon to feel like they have no choice but

688
00:40:06,635 --> 00:40:10,355
Speaker 7:  to buy Nvidia GPUs for their data centers. And

689
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:13,395
Speaker 7:  that's, that was kind of the argument. You should go watch the thing 'cause

690
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:16,235
Speaker 7:  it's cool. But that was more or less the argument Jen was making on stage.

691
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:17,355
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I buy that.

692
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,115
Speaker 7:  Alright, we gotta take a break. We're gonna come back with Lauren Finer the

693
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:25,235
Speaker 7:  Boy. Boy. A lot of things happened in what I have taken to calling the computer

694
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:25,715
Speaker 7:  coup.

695
00:43:13,455 --> 00:43:17,415
Speaker 8:  these tweets and stuff that are like, doge has infiltrated the NIH and

696
00:43:17,415 --> 00:43:21,335
Speaker 8:  they talk about it like it's this like marauding band of bank robbers who

697
00:43:21,335 --> 00:43:25,055
Speaker 8:  are just like running in with masks on and causing all kinds of

698
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,535
Speaker 8:  ruckus. And they're like, they've infiltrated the building and it's just,

699
00:43:28,535 --> 00:43:32,505
Speaker 8:  it's become this very strange like militia that is just

700
00:43:32,505 --> 00:43:36,465
Speaker 8:  like running around DC entering buildings. And I'm realizing as

701
00:43:36,545 --> 00:43:40,105
Speaker 8:  I say this that all these metaphors actually kind of work and are true. But

702
00:43:40,105 --> 00:43:41,705
Speaker 8:  it's, It is a very strange phenomenon.

703
00:43:42,085 --> 00:43:45,385
Speaker 7:  You can see the realization just coming over your face as you were talking

704
00:43:45,385 --> 00:43:48,665
Speaker 7:  out loud. I will say this week the theoretical

705
00:43:48,665 --> 00:43:52,465
Speaker 7:  administrator of Doge Amy Gleason revealed in a

706
00:43:52,465 --> 00:43:55,905
Speaker 7:  filing with the court. This is true. She said Doge has 89 people,

707
00:43:56,505 --> 00:43:59,265
Speaker 7:  but they have no formal org chart or front office

708
00:44:00,825 --> 00:44:03,795
Speaker 7:  Look, I don't, I'm not saying I host a podcast about org charts on the side.

709
00:44:04,015 --> 00:44:06,795
Speaker 7:  I'm not saying that's my hobby. I'm not saying I've asked virtually every

710
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:10,795
Speaker 7:  co in this industry how their company is structured. I'm saying

711
00:44:11,035 --> 00:44:14,875
Speaker 7:  I started The Verge with a bunch of friends. David was like employee number

712
00:44:14,935 --> 00:44:18,755
Speaker 7:  one, and we got to 10 people and we were like, oh, we need

713
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:19,915
Speaker 7:  some fucking structure.

714
00:44:21,855 --> 00:44:25,745
Speaker 7:  Like you cannot have a totally flat 89 person organization

715
00:44:25,775 --> 00:44:29,345
Speaker 7:  that is infiltrating the government. Like it's, it's

716
00:44:29,345 --> 00:44:33,025
Speaker 7:  nonsensical on its face. That's all I'm saying. But it's true. They're

717
00:44:33,025 --> 00:44:36,185
Speaker 7:  infiltrating things. Can actually, Lauren, before we go into the computer

718
00:44:36,335 --> 00:44:39,625
Speaker 7:  coup can I, can I briefly talk about my favorite nonsensical

719
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:44,085
Speaker 7:  the Doge related story? Please do you mind? Okay.

720
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:46,845
Speaker 7:  So as you might expect

721
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:51,815
Speaker 7:  Elon's real hype on putting starlink everywhere in the government.

722
00:44:53,355 --> 00:44:56,725
Speaker 7:  It's just, it's just what he wants. I don't know. It's what he wants. I,

723
00:44:56,945 --> 00:45:00,605
Speaker 7:  Lauren, I, I've never lived in DC My sense of our

724
00:45:00,605 --> 00:45:04,285
Speaker 7:  nation's capital is that ISPs are thick on the ground. Like you can get

725
00:45:04,565 --> 00:45:06,645
Speaker 7:  internet access in Washington DC Yeah,

726
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:09,485
Speaker 12:  I am talking to you from an internet connection right now.

727
00:45:09,935 --> 00:45:13,765
Speaker 7:  There you go. I'm, it just seems, yeah, very easy to get inter access in

728
00:45:13,825 --> 00:45:17,765
Speaker 7:  DC like in most places you're not in the woods or in on

729
00:45:17,765 --> 00:45:19,085
Speaker 7:  the battlefield. Yeah, no, it's

730
00:45:19,085 --> 00:45:21,765
Speaker 8:  Like, it's like a city. Like we Yeah, we they they solved that problem. Yeah.

731
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:25,325
Speaker 7:  David lives there too. Yeah, it's like a whole thing. Yeah. So

732
00:45:25,835 --> 00:45:28,285
Speaker 7:  they've added Starling to the White House,

733
00:45:29,745 --> 00:45:32,125
Speaker 7:  the New York Times reported this week. They've added starlink to the White

734
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:35,725
Speaker 7:  House, but they haven't actually added starlink

735
00:45:35,725 --> 00:45:39,525
Speaker 7:  dishes to the White House. The starlink dishes are in a

736
00:45:39,525 --> 00:45:43,365
Speaker 7:  data center that's miles away. And then the access to

737
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:47,325
Speaker 7:  starlink is being piped in over existing fiber to the White House. And

738
00:45:47,325 --> 00:45:49,205
Speaker 7:  then there's a starlink network at the White House

739
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:52,975
Speaker 7:  already confusing, right? Isn't

740
00:45:52,975 --> 00:45:53,535
Speaker 8:  That just nothing?

741
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:58,415
Speaker 7:  And then we asked the White House and Carolyn Levitt, who I'm

742
00:45:58,485 --> 00:46:02,295
Speaker 7:  sure all of you have seen on social media or television, she responded that

743
00:46:02,295 --> 00:46:06,175
Speaker 7:  the goal is to improve wifi connectivity at the White House.

744
00:46:06,675 --> 00:46:09,455
Speaker 7:  The White House is working to improve white wi wifi connectivity

745
00:46:11,275 --> 00:46:15,145
Speaker 7:  nonsensical on its face. Like I

746
00:46:15,145 --> 00:46:18,625
Speaker 7:  don't, I knew when we wrote this story that our audience would be mad

747
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,585
Speaker 7:  if you wanna improve wifi connectivity, you just add more access points.

748
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:27,265
Speaker 7:  You, you know, you run, maybe you, you do some mesh networking

749
00:46:27,265 --> 00:46:30,825
Speaker 7:  like if you like, it's really wild. But I'm confident the White House has

750
00:46:30,825 --> 00:46:34,585
Speaker 7:  the ability to run cables through the White House complex and put up more

751
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:36,105
Speaker 7:  access points. Do you

752
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:38,985
Speaker 8:  Think if the New York Times had run a story that was like the White House

753
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:42,025
Speaker 8:  put up a bunch of heroes around the West Wing, we would've been like, ah,

754
00:46:42,025 --> 00:46:42,265
Speaker 8:  cool.

755
00:46:42,415 --> 00:46:46,345
Speaker 7:  Yeah, they put up that new outdoor hero, pro seven Pro, everyone loves

756
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,265
Speaker 7:  it. It's great. It's inexpensive, but you get all the bands. Yeah, no, I

757
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:52,745
Speaker 7:  don't know. Like, but, and I'm confident the federal government has it contractors.

758
00:46:53,365 --> 00:46:56,945
Speaker 7:  So if your goal, like, just think about this. My goal is to improve

759
00:46:57,575 --> 00:47:00,145
Speaker 7:  wifi connectivity at the White House. That's what I'm going to say. I'm gonna

760
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:04,035
Speaker 7:  have Carolyn Levit email The Verge dot com and

761
00:47:04,075 --> 00:47:07,555
Speaker 7:  say the goal is to improve wifi connectivity at the White House. And the

762
00:47:07,555 --> 00:47:10,915
Speaker 7:  mechanism by which we're doing that is we're putting Starling dishes

763
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:14,355
Speaker 7:  miles away at a different data center. What

764
00:47:15,445 --> 00:47:19,135
Speaker 7:  it's just, it's, it's, it's every part of covering this

765
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:22,275
Speaker 7:  administration involves this like, just

766
00:47:22,595 --> 00:47:25,835
Speaker 7:  straightforwardly this where you have to, you have to look at it and say

767
00:47:25,835 --> 00:47:29,765
Speaker 7:  that, you know, it doesn't make sense, right? And then, and then they,

768
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:33,525
Speaker 7:  they bluster back at you and that's the end of that conversation. Anyhow,

769
00:47:33,525 --> 00:47:36,205
Speaker 7:  there's Starling to the White House now it's probably insecure. It's probably

770
00:47:36,205 --> 00:47:39,725
Speaker 7:  being hacked by the minute. And the goal is to improve wifi

771
00:47:39,725 --> 00:47:43,135
Speaker 7:  connectivity to Sure. If anyone,

772
00:47:43,675 --> 00:47:47,255
Speaker 7:  by the way this, the story got posted to Reddit, thousands of comments

773
00:47:47,405 --> 00:47:50,815
Speaker 7:  from angry tech nerds on Reddit being like, that's not how you would improve

774
00:47:50,815 --> 00:47:54,775
Speaker 7:  wifi connectivity. You would just add access points. That's what you would

775
00:47:54,775 --> 00:47:58,215
Speaker 7:  do. So I think Elon just wants his own network. That's my firm belief is

776
00:47:58,215 --> 00:48:01,775
Speaker 7:  that he wanted a network outside of the, the, the government's sort of IT

777
00:48:02,135 --> 00:48:02,775
Speaker 7:  security protocols.

778
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:07,175
Speaker 8:  Maybe he realized his, his gaming PC wasn't getting quite

779
00:48:07,315 --> 00:48:11,215
Speaker 8:  the, the lag he was hoping for. So he is like, I can, I can upgrade my

780
00:48:11,215 --> 00:48:12,975
Speaker 8:  ping if I could just get the starlink gun

781
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:14,855
Speaker 7:  Fucking use satellite internet. Yeah.

782
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:20,095
Speaker 7:  I dunno man. It's a weird one. Speaking of starlink, more importantly,

783
00:48:21,475 --> 00:48:24,975
Speaker 7:  the guy who ran the bead program, which is the, the federal rural

784
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:28,605
Speaker 7:  broadband program that was part of the Inflation

785
00:48:28,965 --> 00:48:31,605
Speaker 7:  reduction Act that Biden passed. He quit,

786
00:48:32,745 --> 00:48:36,725
Speaker 7:  you know, as you do, his name is Evan Feinman, and he said that the Trump's

787
00:48:36,725 --> 00:48:39,605
Speaker 7:  administration's overhaul of the bead program would lead to deeply negative

788
00:48:39,765 --> 00:48:43,325
Speaker 7:  outcomes because they would favor starlink. Lauren, I know you've been kind

789
00:48:43,325 --> 00:48:45,485
Speaker 7:  of poking around at this. What, what's going on with this one?

790
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:49,525
Speaker 12:  Yeah, I, I mean I think this is, you know, one of the

791
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:53,485
Speaker 12:  things that everyone is keeping an eye on to see, you

792
00:48:53,485 --> 00:48:57,085
Speaker 12:  know, is Elon Musk's involvement with the government going to have

793
00:48:57,525 --> 00:49:00,925
Speaker 12:  tangible effects on, you know, how his

794
00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:04,725
Speaker 12:  business's fair when it comes to interactions with the federal government.

795
00:49:04,865 --> 00:49:08,765
Speaker 12:  And, you know, I think how broadband is deployed

796
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:12,525
Speaker 12:  across the country is one of the most obvious areas to look for that.

797
00:49:13,465 --> 00:49:17,045
Speaker 12:  So, you know, this is a, a major program that's

798
00:49:17,615 --> 00:49:21,565
Speaker 12:  meant to expand broadband access in rural areas. And,

799
00:49:22,505 --> 00:49:26,325
Speaker 12:  you know, it's kind of placed a lot of emphasis on fiber.

800
00:49:27,505 --> 00:49:31,445
Speaker 12:  So the more that we see that shift to satellite,

801
00:49:31,745 --> 00:49:34,765
Speaker 12:  the more that SpaceX stands to benefit from that.

802
00:49:35,065 --> 00:49:38,885
Speaker 7:  In his email, when he announced he was leaving, Fineman said, the overhaul

803
00:49:38,885 --> 00:49:42,805
Speaker 7:  of the program to favor starlink would strand all or

804
00:49:42,805 --> 00:49:45,245
Speaker 7:  part of rural America with worse internet so that we can make the world's

805
00:49:45,245 --> 00:49:49,045
Speaker 7:  richest man even richer yet another in a long line of betrayals by Washington.

806
00:49:49,975 --> 00:49:53,675
Speaker 7:  The thing that strikes me at this is it's not like the bead program

807
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:58,275
Speaker 7:  has of yet been a stunning success, right? The criticism

808
00:49:58,655 --> 00:50:02,635
Speaker 7:  is you spent all this money on broadband and no one got any broadband. And

809
00:50:02,635 --> 00:50:05,515
Speaker 7:  then the argument, Lauren, as far as I understand It is, well, we gave out

810
00:50:05,515 --> 00:50:07,795
Speaker 7:  the money and now they gotta do it. What's the holdup?

811
00:50:07,945 --> 00:50:11,715
Speaker 12:  Yeah, I mean, I, I think the holdup is, there's kind of a lot of

812
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:14,315
Speaker 12:  red tape here. It's, you know, this is a big

813
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,955
Speaker 12:  undertaking for the government. There's a lot of different ideas about how

814
00:50:18,955 --> 00:50:22,915
Speaker 12:  to do things. So this has been a, a long process in general,

815
00:50:23,215 --> 00:50:27,205
Speaker 12:  not just because of all the changes recently, but I think there's a

816
00:50:27,205 --> 00:50:31,125
Speaker 12:  lot of fear that, you know, in adding more changes

817
00:50:31,385 --> 00:50:35,205
Speaker 12:  at this stage will just drag things out

818
00:50:35,235 --> 00:50:38,845
Speaker 12:  even further, which no one really wants.

819
00:50:39,305 --> 00:50:43,165
Speaker 7:  All right, well we'll keep an eye on this. I do think, and I know everyone's

820
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,765
Speaker 7:  gonna, the Starling people will find me, they're gonna team up with the Nvidia

821
00:50:46,885 --> 00:50:50,845
Speaker 7:  Shield people. It's true that I think wired internet connections are

822
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:55,005
Speaker 7:  superior to wireless internet connections. I'm sorry. We like wires and

823
00:50:55,005 --> 00:50:58,085
Speaker 7:  we like buttons. Yes. These are like two of the foundational beliefs of The

824
00:50:58,205 --> 00:51:01,765
Speaker 7:  Verge. It's also true that Comcast is an ISP and it's an investor and our

825
00:51:01,765 --> 00:51:05,575
Speaker 7:  parent company Box Media, but they hate me. So it's like

826
00:51:05,575 --> 00:51:09,455
Speaker 7:  just, I'm just, I, I just think ethernet is a superior, more

827
00:51:09,735 --> 00:51:13,455
Speaker 7:  reliable than wifi and I think fiber is more secure and reliable than

828
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:17,335
Speaker 7:  satellite. It's just, it's just how it works, man.

829
00:51:18,155 --> 00:51:21,535
Speaker 7:  So we'll see. Right. I think Lauren, we're, we're on the like wait and see

830
00:51:21,785 --> 00:51:23,535
Speaker 7:  phase of what's gonna happen with Bead.

831
00:51:24,135 --> 00:51:25,415
Speaker 12:  I think that's right. Alright.

832
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:29,055
Speaker 7:  There's a number of other things that are sort of in this Wait and see zone.

833
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:33,615
Speaker 7:  TikTok is one of those, right? The Supreme Court said it was

834
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:37,015
Speaker 7:  banned, like it was constitutional for the law that banned it to have banned

835
00:51:37,015 --> 00:51:40,455
Speaker 7:  it. And then Trump took office and he said, nah, don't worry about that until

836
00:51:40,735 --> 00:51:44,655
Speaker 7:  April 5th. It's almost April 5th. What's happening there,

837
00:51:44,655 --> 00:51:45,015
Speaker 7:  Lauren?

838
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:49,295
Speaker 12:  Yeah, so I think the short version is that

839
00:51:49,555 --> 00:51:53,095
Speaker 12:  we haven't really seen anything come of this so far,

840
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:57,175
Speaker 12:  tiktoks in the same ambiguous position. But, you know, all the

841
00:51:57,455 --> 00:52:01,335
Speaker 12:  companies that service it have decided they're, you know,

842
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:04,895
Speaker 12:  pretty much good enough with the legal

843
00:52:05,085 --> 00:52:08,975
Speaker 12:  protections that the Trump administration has offered so far, even

844
00:52:08,975 --> 00:52:12,855
Speaker 12:  though it's technically illegal to service the company at this

845
00:52:12,855 --> 00:52:14,655
Speaker 12:  point, now that it's passed the ban deadline.

846
00:52:16,315 --> 00:52:19,575
Speaker 12:  But we're hearing that Oracle

847
00:52:20,275 --> 00:52:24,215
Speaker 12:  is trying to swoop in and save TikTok from a US

848
00:52:24,415 --> 00:52:28,375
Speaker 12:  ban. And if that sounds familiar, it's because it kind of tried to

849
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:31,815
Speaker 12:  do this before you might remember a

850
00:52:32,745 --> 00:52:36,695
Speaker 12:  thing called Project Texas, which was this whole plan

851
00:52:36,835 --> 00:52:40,575
Speaker 12:  for Oracle to work with TikTok and,

852
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:44,815
Speaker 12:  you know, make sure that all of the US data,

853
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,735
Speaker 12:  the source code was all good. And, you know, there was nothing

854
00:52:48,805 --> 00:52:52,695
Speaker 12:  nefarious happening. And, you know, after TikTok rolled

855
00:52:52,695 --> 00:52:56,415
Speaker 12:  off, wrote, rolled out this huge presentation about

856
00:52:56,415 --> 00:53:00,335
Speaker 12:  Project Texas lawmakers were like, well, you know, we're, we

857
00:53:00,335 --> 00:53:03,975
Speaker 12:  still don't think this is enough. So, you know,

858
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:07,975
Speaker 12:  I, we obviously don't know what exactly a potential

859
00:53:07,975 --> 00:53:11,695
Speaker 12:  deal with Oracle, assuming that's what Trump is

860
00:53:11,695 --> 00:53:15,375
Speaker 12:  looking at here would look like. But from everything that's been

861
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:19,415
Speaker 12:  rumored, it, it sounds pretty similar to Project Texas, which

862
00:53:19,885 --> 00:53:23,055
Speaker 12:  begs the question, you know, what change

863
00:53:23,675 --> 00:53:26,485
Speaker 12:  and will lawmakers get on board with this this time?

864
00:53:27,035 --> 00:53:30,605
Speaker 7:  There's a JD Vance quote he said to NBC news.

865
00:53:30,895 --> 00:53:34,645
Speaker 7:  There will almost certainly be a high level agreement that I think satisfies

866
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:38,085
Speaker 7:  our national security concerns and allows there to be a distinct American

867
00:53:38,105 --> 00:53:39,085
Speaker 7:  TikTok enterprise.

868
00:53:41,055 --> 00:53:42,215
Speaker 7:  I don't actually know what that means.

869
00:53:42,215 --> 00:53:44,695
Speaker 8:  That doesn't mean anything. Wait, can I, can I read you a slightly longer

870
00:53:44,695 --> 00:53:47,855
Speaker 8:  version of that quote that is more words and says even less.

871
00:53:48,915 --> 00:53:52,335
Speaker 8:  He says, we'd like to get it done without the extension. I think the question

872
00:53:52,335 --> 00:53:55,335
Speaker 8:  is what is the equity ownership of the new joint venture? How do you do the

873
00:53:55,455 --> 00:53:58,015
Speaker 8:  contracts for all the investors, the customers, the service providers? The

874
00:53:58,015 --> 00:54:00,855
Speaker 8:  deal itself will be very clear, but actually creating those thousands and

875
00:54:01,015 --> 00:54:03,815
Speaker 8:  thousands of pages of legal documents, that's the one thing I worry could

876
00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:07,695
Speaker 8:  slip. Do you know what that list comprises the deal he

877
00:54:07,695 --> 00:54:10,895
Speaker 8:  just described. We're gonna have the deal done, we just might not have the

878
00:54:10,895 --> 00:54:11,255
Speaker 8:  deal done.

879
00:54:12,005 --> 00:54:15,175
Speaker 12:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And you know, actually we're

880
00:54:15,775 --> 00:54:19,175
Speaker 12:  interestingly starting to see some warning from some

881
00:54:20,335 --> 00:54:24,135
Speaker 12:  Republicans in Congress. John Lennar, who

882
00:54:24,425 --> 00:54:28,095
Speaker 12:  leads the House select committee on China, actually

883
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:31,535
Speaker 12:  said, you know, the law, he said, quote, the law is clear, any deal must

884
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:35,055
Speaker 12:  eliminate Chinese influence and control over the app to safeguard our

885
00:54:35,255 --> 00:54:39,135
Speaker 12:  interests. And he also said that, you know, ance has to

886
00:54:39,135 --> 00:54:42,815
Speaker 12:  fully divest control of TikTok and have no say in its operation. So

887
00:54:43,275 --> 00:54:46,935
Speaker 12:  he is pretty clear that, you know, there has to be a clean break

888
00:54:47,085 --> 00:54:51,055
Speaker 12:  from by dance, which doesn't seem to be what Trump has

889
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:54,135
Speaker 12:  indicated he's going for in his past public statements.

890
00:54:54,635 --> 00:54:58,335
Speaker 8:  Is it possible that this just works out to be essentially a

891
00:54:58,385 --> 00:55:01,935
Speaker 8:  redux of the whole project Texas Oracle deal, but they're gonna

892
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:05,415
Speaker 8:  spin it in a more politically advantageous way

893
00:55:05,915 --> 00:55:08,935
Speaker 8:  and then just ram it through whatever they have to ram it through because

894
00:55:08,935 --> 00:55:11,735
Speaker 8:  they feel like they can, like th this feels to me like they're just gonna

895
00:55:11,735 --> 00:55:15,615
Speaker 8:  say, Oracle, fix it and then just yell loudly at whatever Congress

896
00:55:15,615 --> 00:55:18,255
Speaker 8:  people they need to make that workable.

897
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:22,175
Speaker 12:  I think it's certainly possible. I, I think it puts a lot of

898
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:26,335
Speaker 12:  Republicans in a really tough position because I

899
00:55:26,335 --> 00:55:30,015
Speaker 12:  think the whole concern with Project Texas before was like, this

900
00:55:30,015 --> 00:55:33,575
Speaker 12:  doesn't get at the fundamental issue we have with by dance owning

901
00:55:34,595 --> 00:55:38,175
Speaker 12:  TikTok and you know, potentially still having a say over their

902
00:55:38,175 --> 00:55:42,135
Speaker 12:  operations and, you know, potentially as the argument goes, giving

903
00:55:42,435 --> 00:55:46,375
Speaker 12:  the Chinese government some sort of access point to us user

904
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:50,335
Speaker 12:  information or to, you know, kind of change the levers that

905
00:55:50,335 --> 00:55:54,095
Speaker 12:  are being pulled over, you know, what content is surfaced to Americans.

906
00:55:54,195 --> 00:55:57,775
Speaker 12:  So, you know, if that doesn't change, then

907
00:55:58,035 --> 00:56:01,935
Speaker 12:  it puts a lot of Republicans who I think, you know, despite what you

908
00:56:02,145 --> 00:56:06,135
Speaker 12:  might believe about the validity of that argument, I think do seem

909
00:56:06,135 --> 00:56:09,415
Speaker 12:  to really believe that puts them in a tough spot

910
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:13,975
Speaker 12:  to just, you know, go against the President if what he wants is very different

911
00:56:13,975 --> 00:56:14,735
Speaker 12:  from that. It's

912
00:56:14,735 --> 00:56:18,535
Speaker 8:  All just so weird. The politics of this is just so bizarre

913
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:22,655
Speaker 8:  that like Trump tried to ban TikTok the first time so much of this

914
00:56:22,895 --> 00:56:26,685
Speaker 8:  happened because Trump tried to ban TikTok the first time and then it

915
00:56:26,685 --> 00:56:30,605
Speaker 8:  became this incredibly bipartisan thing. Like Neli,

916
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:33,125
Speaker 8:  you and I have argued about this on the show a hundred times now, but like

917
00:56:33,385 --> 00:56:35,805
Speaker 8:  the, the fact of the matter is a bunch of senators got this briefing and

918
00:56:35,805 --> 00:56:37,445
Speaker 8:  then voted 50 to zero to ban it. Like

919
00:56:39,035 --> 00:56:42,765
Speaker 8:  it's, everybody wanted this to happen. And then Trump changed his mind during

920
00:56:42,765 --> 00:56:46,125
Speaker 8:  the election season and became like the great crusader to save TikTok

921
00:56:47,505 --> 00:56:50,725
Speaker 8:  and now might just give it to Oracle because he and Larry Ellison are buddies,

922
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:51,085
Speaker 8:  by

923
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:54,765
Speaker 7:  The way, while he is hiking tariffs on China every single

924
00:56:54,865 --> 00:56:58,725
Speaker 7:  day, right? Like he's a Trump is a China hawk, he's not,

925
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:03,205
Speaker 7:  this isn't it, It is incoherent like on its face, right? And

926
00:57:03,205 --> 00:57:03,325
Speaker 7:  so

927
00:57:03,325 --> 00:57:06,965
Speaker 8:  Even if you're just trying to do what you think the Trump

928
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:10,165
Speaker 8:  administration wants you to do to stay in the good favor of the President,

929
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:14,245
Speaker 8:  I don't even know how to figure out what that is. If I'm a member of Congress

930
00:57:14,245 --> 00:57:15,805
Speaker 8:  who has to figure out what to do at this right now.

931
00:57:16,355 --> 00:57:19,445
Speaker 12:  Yeah, I think it's gonna be really tough for,

932
00:57:20,565 --> 00:57:23,845
Speaker 12:  I, I don't know how they're going to kind of square that circle. I think,

933
00:57:24,105 --> 00:57:27,685
Speaker 12:  you know, it's a a lot of different moving pieces

934
00:57:27,905 --> 00:57:31,685
Speaker 12:  and you know, so far we haven't seen many

935
00:57:32,005 --> 00:57:35,885
Speaker 12:  Republicans go, you know, directly against Trump. So

936
00:57:36,425 --> 00:57:39,885
Speaker 12:  in a sense it's kind of like, you know, why would they

937
00:57:40,175 --> 00:57:43,765
Speaker 12:  start doing that? Now on the other hand, this is something that

938
00:57:44,505 --> 00:57:48,405
Speaker 12:  an overwhelming number of lawmakers, including Republicans

939
00:57:48,405 --> 00:57:52,325
Speaker 12:  voted for and, you know, seem to really believe in even

940
00:57:52,325 --> 00:57:56,285
Speaker 12:  despite pushback from their own constituents. So you know

941
00:57:56,905 --> 00:58:00,525
Speaker 12:  it to just completely do an about face on that would be really

942
00:58:01,285 --> 00:58:02,125
Speaker 12:  stunning. Yeah,

943
00:58:02,535 --> 00:58:06,205
Speaker 7:  We'll see there, we there's a big April coming up, right? It's TikTok ban.

944
00:58:06,675 --> 00:58:10,565
Speaker 7:  There's the big antitrust trial for meta where the, the,

945
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:13,805
Speaker 7:  the stakes are splitting off Instagram and WhatsApp. Where's the Google search

946
00:58:13,805 --> 00:58:15,965
Speaker 7:  remedies trial? A lot of things are gonna happen.

947
00:58:16,115 --> 00:58:16,805
Speaker 8:  More tariffs,

948
00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:20,845
Speaker 7:  More more tariffs are gonna hit. Can't forget tariffs. Dear sweet

949
00:58:20,845 --> 00:58:24,725
Speaker 7:  tariffs. Soon all of Canada will be illegal. From what

950
00:58:24,725 --> 00:58:28,045
Speaker 7:  I understand. It'll just be criminal to even know about Canada.

951
00:58:29,325 --> 00:58:31,935
Speaker 7:  That'll be ironic. Another deep cut right there.

952
00:58:33,505 --> 00:58:37,455
Speaker 7:  Sorry, I thought of a famous Canadian and that's what happened to me. I

953
00:58:37,455 --> 00:58:41,375
Speaker 7:  am so sorry. We're gonna see we we a couple weeks from now.

954
00:58:41,615 --> 00:58:45,135
Speaker 7:  I think the world will go a a wee bit topsy-turvy, especially Israeli sec.

955
00:58:46,635 --> 00:58:50,455
Speaker 7:  The world is already topsy-turvy. Lauren, I think the

956
00:58:50,595 --> 00:58:54,335
Speaker 7:  big story of this week is what happened at the FTC. So if you're

957
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:58,335
Speaker 7:  staring at, okay, next month we've got some big antitrust trials.

958
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:02,415
Speaker 7:  One of them is the meta trial, that one is being led by the FTC. We've got

959
00:59:02,565 --> 00:59:06,455
Speaker 7:  some enforcement actions against Amazon. The Trump FTC

960
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:09,815
Speaker 7:  Federal Trade Commission has not been soft on these companies. They've been

961
00:59:10,015 --> 00:59:13,775
Speaker 7:  pretty aggressive. They've held up Le Kahn's merger guidelines,

962
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:18,405
Speaker 7:  but at the same time, Trump illegally fired two Democratic commissioners

963
00:59:18,405 --> 00:59:22,165
Speaker 7:  this week. Like the law there is very clear and he just did it. Anyway, what

964
00:59:22,165 --> 00:59:22,685
Speaker 7:  is going on there?

965
00:59:23,235 --> 00:59:26,005
Speaker 12:  Yeah. So yeah, this week Trump

966
00:59:26,895 --> 00:59:30,765
Speaker 12:  fired the two remaining Democrats on the Federal Trade Commission,

967
00:59:31,695 --> 00:59:35,325
Speaker 12:  which was, you know, a really sudden and shocking

968
00:59:36,135 --> 00:59:39,925
Speaker 12:  thing to do because there is Supreme

969
00:59:40,015 --> 00:59:43,965
Speaker 12:  Court precedent where, you know, a president had tried to

970
00:59:43,965 --> 00:59:47,885
Speaker 12:  do pretty much exactly that and the Supreme Court said you can't do that

971
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:51,445
Speaker 12:  because the Federal Trade Commission is an independent agency

972
00:59:52,315 --> 00:59:54,965
Speaker 12:  even though it's, you know, technically a part of the executive branch

973
00:59:56,425 --> 01:00:00,285
Speaker 12:  and you know, FTC commissioners have to be fired for

974
01:00:00,285 --> 01:00:04,125
Speaker 12:  cause essentially. But that doesn't seem to be what was done

975
01:00:04,195 --> 01:00:07,565
Speaker 12:  here. And now there's two remaining Republican

976
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:11,525
Speaker 12:  commissioners at the FTC. Just to be clear, the

977
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,845
Speaker 12:  democratic commissioners say, you know, they don't think they can really

978
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:18,725
Speaker 12:  be fired. So they're, you know, pretty much saying we're still

979
01:00:18,725 --> 01:00:22,405
Speaker 12:  commissioners or we should be. And then we have a

980
01:00:22,405 --> 01:00:25,645
Speaker 12:  third Republican commissioner who's set up to be

981
01:00:26,075 --> 01:00:29,885
Speaker 12:  confirmed at some point to the role. So, you know, what makes

982
01:00:29,885 --> 01:00:33,485
Speaker 12:  this even more confusing is that Republicans already

983
01:00:33,895 --> 01:00:37,725
Speaker 12:  would have a majority on the commission. So Democrats wouldn't really be

984
01:00:37,725 --> 01:00:41,525
Speaker 12:  able to sway how a lot of decisions come out.

985
01:00:41,745 --> 01:00:45,525
Speaker 12:  But you know, it's kind of just getting rid of this dissenting voice

986
01:00:45,705 --> 01:00:49,325
Speaker 12:  or you know, maybe a voice that would be able to sway some commissioners

987
01:00:49,365 --> 01:00:50,405
Speaker 12:  a little bit, one way or another.

988
01:00:51,025 --> 01:00:54,925
Speaker 7:  It does seem like one of the reasons for this firing is

989
01:00:54,945 --> 01:00:58,085
Speaker 7:  to set up the Supreme Court challenge that would overturn,

990
01:00:58,885 --> 01:01:01,565
Speaker 7:  I think it's a hundred year old Supreme Court precedent called Humphrey's

991
01:01:01,565 --> 01:01:05,285
Speaker 7:  executor Sarah Jung, our features editor. And I keep joking

992
01:01:05,315 --> 01:01:09,205
Speaker 7:  that everything we learned in law school is, is valueless. Like

993
01:01:09,545 --> 01:01:12,325
Speaker 7:  you learn this case in law school, it's just like how does the government

994
01:01:12,405 --> 01:01:16,045
Speaker 7:  work? And like it's on the list of cases you read about what you can and

995
01:01:16,045 --> 01:01:19,885
Speaker 7:  can't do. And this one is very much, it's like on the nose the president

996
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:23,805
Speaker 7:  can't fire FTC commissioners, you just can't do it unless there's cause

997
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,925
Speaker 7:  and here he didn't have cause you just fired them. So it's illegal, like

998
01:01:26,925 --> 01:01:29,525
Speaker 7:  the law is clear and he did the thing that the case says you can't do,

999
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:34,535
Speaker 7:  but you do that on purpose 'cause you wanna go to the Supreme Court and get

1000
01:01:34,535 --> 01:01:37,695
Speaker 7:  the law of return, which this Supreme Court is very willing to do. So it's

1001
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:40,935
Speaker 7:  a very odd limbo. Right. The thing that gets me though

1002
01:01:41,515 --> 01:01:45,175
Speaker 7:  is this FTC is still set up

1003
01:01:45,795 --> 01:01:49,495
Speaker 7:  to be extraordinarily hostile to tech companies. Like

1004
01:01:49,725 --> 01:01:53,015
Speaker 7:  what, outside of we're, we're running this legal challenge

1005
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:57,535
Speaker 7:  to chase down this idea of the unitary executive where the president

1006
01:01:57,555 --> 01:02:01,415
Speaker 7:  is basically a king, which is a thing like the federal

1007
01:02:01,415 --> 01:02:05,095
Speaker 7:  society isn't pushing this idea for a long time. Outside of that, doesn't

1008
01:02:05,095 --> 01:02:08,975
Speaker 7:  it seem like they're, they're losing their credibility to go after

1009
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:12,735
Speaker 7:  the tech companies the way that they've already wanted to. Like Bedoya one

1010
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:16,575
Speaker 7:  of the fired commissioners is like, I got fired 'cause I'm, I criticized

1011
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:20,445
Speaker 7:  Jeff Bezos. But then you turn around and Trump loves to criticize

1012
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,765
Speaker 7:  Jeff ba like I, I I kind of don't understand the goal here.

1013
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:27,005
Speaker 12:  Yeah, I think that's been kind of a big conundrum with this one. You know,

1014
01:02:27,165 --> 01:02:30,605
Speaker 12:  I think on the one hand maybe Trump

1015
01:02:31,235 --> 01:02:35,085
Speaker 12:  kind of made this decision outside of those considerations and said, you

1016
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:38,845
Speaker 12:  know, I just wanna make sure I have full control over the FTC. On the other

1017
01:02:38,845 --> 01:02:42,685
Speaker 12:  hand, it's concerning because if, you know you have an FTC

1018
01:02:42,715 --> 01:02:46,605
Speaker 12:  that does want to go after legitimate issues in the

1019
01:02:46,605 --> 01:02:50,365
Speaker 12:  tech industry, and you have a Republican chair who says he

1020
01:02:50,365 --> 01:02:54,085
Speaker 12:  wants to take on the tech companies, I think one of the

1021
01:02:54,085 --> 01:02:54,845
Speaker 12:  commissioners actually

1022
01:02:56,355 --> 01:03:00,325
Speaker 12:  said something to the effect of, you know, Ferguson, the

1023
01:03:00,685 --> 01:03:04,285
Speaker 12:  Republican chair is interested in going after tech, but what happens

1024
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:08,565
Speaker 12:  if he gets a call from the White House saying, you know,

1025
01:03:08,655 --> 01:03:12,245
Speaker 12:  don't go after this executive who is

1026
01:03:12,605 --> 01:03:16,285
Speaker 12:  becoming friendly with the White House. So, you know, I think

1027
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:20,245
Speaker 12:  it, it just calls into question the whole idea of the independence

1028
01:03:20,265 --> 01:03:24,045
Speaker 12:  of the agency, which is something that Trump has already tried to

1029
01:03:24,265 --> 01:03:27,845
Speaker 12:  assert power over in, you know, issuing an

1030
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:31,485
Speaker 12:  executive order, kind of trying to exert more supervisory

1031
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:35,605
Speaker 12:  influence over independent agencies. So, you know, I I think

1032
01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:39,285
Speaker 12:  this is just, it's more about it being another step in the direction

1033
01:03:39,785 --> 01:03:43,765
Speaker 12:  toward controlling what are supposed to be independent

1034
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:47,925
Speaker 12:  agencies that are able to kind of follow the facts where they lead and issue

1035
01:03:47,925 --> 01:03:51,845
Speaker 12:  enforcement actions. And the, you know, continuance of

1036
01:03:51,845 --> 01:03:53,885
Speaker 12:  that is being called into question now.

1037
01:03:54,355 --> 01:03:58,205
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it seems dead certainty that this case will end up back before

1038
01:03:58,205 --> 01:04:01,565
Speaker 7:  the Supreme Court and we will end up writing an explainer about a hundred

1039
01:04:01,565 --> 01:04:05,405
Speaker 7:  year old Supreme Court precedents that get overturned. But the context is

1040
01:04:05,835 --> 01:04:09,605
Speaker 7:  this is how the government goes and regulates a meta or an Amazon

1041
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:13,365
Speaker 7:  or seeks a breakup of these companies in one way or another. And it,

1042
01:04:14,195 --> 01:04:18,005
Speaker 7:  if you make that politics, then you get real corrupt

1043
01:04:18,005 --> 01:04:21,925
Speaker 7:  real fast, right? You get real stupid real fast. If that is now a like a

1044
01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:25,565
Speaker 7:  horse traded negotiation as opposed to here's the

1045
01:04:25,565 --> 01:04:29,525
Speaker 7:  antitrust law that's being applied. Like I I I, I'm struggling

1046
01:04:29,525 --> 01:04:32,445
Speaker 7:  to articulate this, but it just, the thing I wanna say is like if you make

1047
01:04:32,445 --> 01:04:36,005
Speaker 7:  everything this political, you get stupid. Like there's

1048
01:04:36,275 --> 01:04:39,885
Speaker 7:  like, you just start, you just lose your grasp on reality. 'cause everything

1049
01:04:39,885 --> 01:04:43,645
Speaker 7:  has to be politically expedient or politically coherent, not logically

1050
01:04:43,645 --> 01:04:47,285
Speaker 7:  coherent. And this one to me is just like they have the votes anyway. But

1051
01:04:47,285 --> 01:04:47,565
Speaker 7:  if you're

1052
01:04:47,805 --> 01:04:51,285
Speaker 8:  The, if you're the Trump administration and you're in a phase of testing

1053
01:04:51,285 --> 01:04:55,105
Speaker 8:  your own invincibility, maybe it's pretty useful to make

1054
01:04:55,105 --> 01:04:58,985
Speaker 8:  everything politics because then everything runs through you specifically

1055
01:04:59,285 --> 01:05:03,265
Speaker 8:  and, and you get to horse trade anything you want. And I think like one of

1056
01:05:03,265 --> 01:05:04,305
Speaker 8:  the strange things about this is

1057
01:05:06,365 --> 01:05:10,265
Speaker 8:  the, the Trump administration in certain ways is incredibly business friendly.

1058
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:14,145
Speaker 8:  And a lot of the reaction to this has been, this is what an incredible

1059
01:05:14,145 --> 01:05:17,645
Speaker 8:  victory for all the rich people out there who are now not going to be regulated

1060
01:05:17,645 --> 01:05:21,605
Speaker 8:  in any meaningful way except the tech companies like the FTC

1061
01:05:21,775 --> 01:05:25,765
Speaker 8:  would loves business and wants to tear big deck to the ground. And I think

1062
01:05:25,835 --> 01:05:29,725
Speaker 8:  that that, that whole cognitive

1063
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:33,205
Speaker 8:  dissonance is, is very loud inside of all of this decision for me. It's very

1064
01:05:33,205 --> 01:05:33,525
Speaker 8:  strange.

1065
01:05:33,875 --> 01:05:37,845
Speaker 7:  Yeah, and even the, you know, we mentioned that Google remedies phase

1066
01:05:37,845 --> 01:05:41,325
Speaker 7:  of the search antitrust trials coming up, that case was started in Trump

1067
01:05:41,425 --> 01:05:45,245
Speaker 7:  won, carried out under the Biden administration. Phase one

1068
01:05:45,385 --> 01:05:49,285
Speaker 7:  was won under the Biden administration and now the remedies

1069
01:05:49,285 --> 01:05:52,725
Speaker 7:  phase, what are we gonna do to Google will be handled by a new Trump administration

1070
01:05:53,395 --> 01:05:57,205
Speaker 7:  that is just like a meaningfully different footing. Like

1071
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:01,645
Speaker 7:  the last Trump administration antitrust posture was

1072
01:06:02,275 --> 01:06:06,245
Speaker 7:  literally, we will find a way to broker a deal for T-Mobile

1073
01:06:06,265 --> 01:06:08,965
Speaker 7:  to buy Sprint. Like we will arrange this to happen.

1074
01:06:10,745 --> 01:06:14,485
Speaker 7:  Boy, do I have feelings about that? Have you guys all been using your dish

1075
01:06:14,485 --> 01:06:17,925
Speaker 7:  network 5G, everybody did that work? That'd be great. I love it.

1076
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:21,365
Speaker 8:  I have Ting internet, which I think is Dish, so,

1077
01:06:22,425 --> 01:06:25,605
Speaker 7:  But that was the first Trump administration's posture and they are the ones

1078
01:06:25,605 --> 01:06:29,455
Speaker 7:  who started the Google antitrust trial. This new Trump

1079
01:06:29,455 --> 01:06:33,375
Speaker 7:  administration is way more aggressive, right? They, they've picked

1080
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:36,495
Speaker 7:  up a lot of the pieces from the Biden administration's posture towards the

1081
01:06:36,495 --> 01:06:39,095
Speaker 7:  tech industry and they're carrying it out and it just, there's a part of

1082
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:42,335
Speaker 7:  this where, oh, that's great co-regulate tech companies and there's a part

1083
01:06:42,335 --> 01:06:45,975
Speaker 7:  of, it's, we've been calling it gangster tech regulation where

1084
01:06:46,605 --> 01:06:49,775
Speaker 7:  they're just gonna, I don't like where Mark Zuckerberg's gonna show up and

1085
01:06:49,775 --> 01:06:52,735
Speaker 7:  like, I made you a solid gold Porsche and that'll be the end of it. You know,

1086
01:06:52,805 --> 01:06:56,735
Speaker 7:  like he gets to keep Instagram and I just, this level of politics I think

1087
01:06:56,735 --> 01:07:00,535
Speaker 7:  makes you dumb. Speaking of dummies, Lauren,

1088
01:07:00,535 --> 01:07:04,415
Speaker 7:  welcome to the, now you can see me can play about Brendan Carr.

1089
01:07:05,335 --> 01:07:09,295
Speaker 8:  Wait, can I, can I tell you something very fun? Yeah. So I, I like to

1090
01:07:09,295 --> 01:07:12,255
Speaker 8:  call this America's favorite podcast within a podcast because It is that,

1091
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:16,215
Speaker 8:  and it's very exciting. We heard from a number of fans of the podcast, my

1092
01:07:16,215 --> 01:07:19,335
Speaker 8:  brother, my Brother and Me, which is a podcast that I love very much. And

1093
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:22,655
Speaker 8:  they also have a podcast within a podcast called Munch Squad, where they

1094
01:07:22,655 --> 01:07:26,375
Speaker 8:  talk about fast food and, and brand eating. So

1095
01:07:26,515 --> 01:07:30,015
Speaker 8:  we now have a podcast enemy and it's Munch Squad. And I just wanted to tell

1096
01:07:30,015 --> 01:07:32,695
Speaker 8:  you that because it's very exciting. These are now we, it's a heated race

1097
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:36,095
Speaker 8:  for America's favorite podcaster than a podcast. And

1098
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:38,695
Speaker 8:  I vote Brendan Carr.

1099
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:42,745
Speaker 7:  I, I can't believe I can pull this transition off, but I can do it.

1100
01:07:43,445 --> 01:07:47,275
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna do it. You ready? So I believe

1101
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:50,875
Speaker 7:  on the Munch cast, they have talked about Reese's Peanut butter

1102
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:52,275
Speaker 8:  Cups. They have, yeah.

1103
01:07:54,565 --> 01:07:57,995
Speaker 7:  We'll get to Brendan in a second. Welcome to Brendan Carr's dummy America's

1104
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:01,075
Speaker 7:  favorite podcast within a podcast. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr is a notable

1105
01:08:01,075 --> 01:08:04,355
Speaker 7:  dummy, his predecessor a Jeep Pie. And Trump won,

1106
01:08:06,155 --> 01:08:09,825
Speaker 7:  loved to drink outta a giant oversized novelty. Reese's Peanut butter

1107
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:13,805
Speaker 7:  cup. They, they had a huge coffee cup, Reese's logo on it. It went everywhere

1108
01:08:13,805 --> 01:08:17,725
Speaker 7:  he went as he tore down consumer protections across the country, made

1109
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:20,685
Speaker 7:  internet access more expensive and worse for everybody. Literally, one of

1110
01:08:20,685 --> 01:08:23,805
Speaker 7:  the first things he did was he got rid of the privacy rules that ISPs were,

1111
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:26,765
Speaker 7:  were made to operate under. So now they can share your data. Great. Love

1112
01:08:26,765 --> 01:08:29,935
Speaker 7:  it. But the mug, it made him, you know, charming.

1113
01:08:31,355 --> 01:08:34,895
Speaker 7:  Hey, guess who? The new president of the CTIA, the wireless

1114
01:08:35,015 --> 01:08:36,255
Speaker 7:  lobbyist group is.

01:08:36,525 --> 01:08:37,055
Speaker 8:  Wait, really?

1116
01:08:37,475 --> 01:08:41,335
Speaker 7:  Yep. He's back. The Wireless Industry Association New president,

1117
01:08:41,735 --> 01:08:45,695
Speaker 7:  a Jeep pie, effective April one doors just spinning

1118
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:48,815
Speaker 7:  baby. You just leave the government agency that's supposed to regulate the

1119
01:08:48,975 --> 01:08:52,575
Speaker 7:  wireless industry land at the top of the wireless

1120
01:08:52,935 --> 01:08:54,175
Speaker 7:  industry's lobbyist group.

1121
01:08:54,445 --> 01:08:55,055
Speaker 8:  Fantastic.

1122
01:08:56,365 --> 01:09:00,215
Speaker 7:  He's honored to lead CTIA, by the way, the wireless industry is a key driver

1123
01:09:00,215 --> 01:09:02,095
Speaker 7:  of technology innovation investment in the United States.

1124
01:09:04,475 --> 01:09:05,325
Speaker 7:  He's got a huge check think mug

1125
01:09:05,325 --> 01:09:05,805
Speaker 8:  Goes with

1126
01:09:06,345 --> 01:09:07,285
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. There's no way

1127
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:10,285
Speaker 8:  You don't think the mug is like technically a government property.

1128
01:09:10,465 --> 01:09:12,685
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna mail him a grape and be like, do surgery on this.

1129
01:09:15,075 --> 01:09:16,975
Speaker 8:  No, but you can't mail it to him. You have to leave it at your house. You

1130
01:09:16,975 --> 01:09:19,415
Speaker 8:  have to send him a picture and you have to say, do surgery on this

1131
01:09:20,565 --> 01:09:23,135
Speaker 7:  5G come and get it, dude.

1132
01:09:24,485 --> 01:09:27,975
Speaker 7:  I'll be here waiting. All right, so Brendan, this week it was revealed that

1133
01:09:27,975 --> 01:09:31,935
Speaker 7:  he sent a letter. He's investigating 13

1134
01:09:31,995 --> 01:09:35,695
Speaker 7:  public radio stations, including WBEZ, which

1135
01:09:36,195 --> 01:09:39,845
Speaker 7:  is this American life, right? Yeah. It's this American life. It is

1136
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:43,805
Speaker 7:  WBEZ. Yeah. So this American life is under investigation from Bren and Carr

1137
01:09:43,955 --> 01:09:47,285
Speaker 7:  over what he says is illegal advertising because they do this thing called

1138
01:09:47,285 --> 01:09:51,185
Speaker 7:  underwriting where you know, it says this program is brought to you by da

1139
01:09:51,185 --> 01:09:54,945
Speaker 7:  da da da. That's advertising. And if you're doing advertising then you can

1140
01:09:54,945 --> 01:09:55,625
Speaker 7:  get your funding cut.

1141
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:59,425
Speaker 8:  That's like the thing that NPR r has been doing forever and ever.

1142
01:09:59,425 --> 01:09:59,825
Speaker 8:  Always.

1143
01:10:00,595 --> 01:10:01,735
Speaker 7:  That's what they do. Like,

1144
01:10:01,765 --> 01:10:03,175
Speaker 8:  Yeah, that's like NPR R'S whole thing.

1145
01:10:03,475 --> 01:10:06,695
Speaker 7:  We do not give enough public dollars to these radio stations to rate so you

1146
01:10:06,695 --> 01:10:09,575
Speaker 7:  underwriting to cover the gap and never gets to feel good about themselves.

1147
01:10:09,595 --> 01:10:12,335
Speaker 7:  And there's a gala at the shed Aquarium or whatever in Chicago.

1148
01:10:12,555 --> 01:10:15,575
Speaker 8:  But the argument is because they say the name of the underwriter on the thing.

1149
01:10:15,575 --> 01:10:16,535
Speaker 8:  Now that's advertising.

1150
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:20,855
Speaker 7:  Here's what Brendan said. I'm concerned that NPR and PBS broadcast could

1151
01:10:20,855 --> 01:10:24,775
Speaker 7:  be violating federal law by airing commercials. It is possible that

1152
01:10:24,815 --> 01:10:28,095
Speaker 7:  NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that

1153
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:31,535
Speaker 7:  cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements. I do not see a

1154
01:10:31,535 --> 01:10:34,735
Speaker 7:  reason why Congress should continue sending taxpayer dollars to NPR and PBS

1155
01:10:34,785 --> 01:10:38,645
Speaker 7:  given the changes in the media marketplace. So he's just

1156
01:10:38,645 --> 01:10:41,325
Speaker 7:  looking for an excuse to cut funding to NPR and PS That's what that sounds

1157
01:10:41,325 --> 01:10:44,365
Speaker 7:  like. You think, sir, to woke for its part. WBEZ

1158
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:48,445
Speaker 7:  says they received the letter on February 28th. We can confirm. We received

1159
01:10:48,445 --> 01:10:51,805
Speaker 7:  the letter. They said in statements they've requested detailed information.

1160
01:10:51,865 --> 01:10:55,445
Speaker 7:  We adhere to the FCC underwriting guidelines. We're confident that

1161
01:10:55,575 --> 01:10:59,085
Speaker 7:  we'll demonstrate compliance. I should note here just a disclosure, it's

1162
01:10:59,085 --> 01:11:02,835
Speaker 7:  like a, it's not actually a disclosure, but WBEZ is part of

1163
01:11:02,835 --> 01:11:06,235
Speaker 7:  Chicago Public Media, the CEO of Chicago Public Media

1164
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:10,635
Speaker 7:  is our old publisher. Melissa Bell. She co-founded rock.com.

1165
01:11:11,665 --> 01:11:15,445
Speaker 7:  Yeah, she's fan boss. I I sent her a text. She hasn't responded to me.

1166
01:11:15,945 --> 01:11:18,125
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna try to get her under coder. Melissa, if you would like to come

1167
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:21,285
Speaker 7:  dunk on Brendan. Yeah, that's a choice. I suspect she will Not

1168
01:11:22,675 --> 01:11:26,565
Speaker 7:  just to put that out there. I suspect she will not. But there, there's your,

1169
01:11:26,565 --> 01:11:29,885
Speaker 7:  there's your disclosure. This is just noise, right? This is

1170
01:11:30,195 --> 01:11:34,005
Speaker 7:  Brendan once again going after media that he dislikes 'cause it's too

1171
01:11:34,005 --> 01:11:36,205
Speaker 7:  woke or too liberal or too bad or whatever he thinks

1172
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:41,205
Speaker 7:  concocting some bullshit to ex to express

1173
01:11:41,265 --> 01:11:44,925
Speaker 7:  his power. And then he's attacking this American life by saying, I will make

1174
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:48,645
Speaker 7:  sure the government stops funding you because I have decided that you're

1175
01:11:49,005 --> 01:11:52,845
Speaker 7:  underwriting sponsorships are illegal advertising and Congress

1176
01:11:52,845 --> 01:11:56,645
Speaker 7:  shouldn't fund you anymore. And that is just again, Brendan Carr trying to

1177
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,725
Speaker 7:  chill speech in America that he disagrees with. And he does this week in

1178
01:11:59,745 --> 01:12:03,645
Speaker 7:  and week out. I, I barely even have to research this segment. I start

1179
01:12:03,645 --> 01:12:06,925
Speaker 7:  typing Brendan Carr into my laptop. It auto completes. And then there's a

1180
01:12:06,925 --> 01:12:10,685
Speaker 7:  list of bullshit this man does to chill speech in America every week

1181
01:12:10,685 --> 01:12:14,645
Speaker 7:  without fail. So we're gonna keep covering what's going on here. We're looking

1182
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:18,205
Speaker 7:  for the other stations that received this letter. If you know who they are,

1183
01:12:18,265 --> 01:12:22,045
Speaker 7:  if you work, you can tip us. We, we'd love to talk to you about this, but

1184
01:12:22,045 --> 01:12:25,805
Speaker 7:  this is just nonsense. Like the First amendment in this country is directly

1185
01:12:25,805 --> 01:12:29,725
Speaker 7:  under attack and a huge variety of ways. We've covered what's

1186
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:33,685
Speaker 7:  going on on campus with protests and protestors being removed at Columbia.

1187
01:12:34,505 --> 01:12:38,205
Speaker 7:  We have a great story this week about what's happening to immigrants who

1188
01:12:38,205 --> 01:12:41,205
Speaker 7:  are landing at airports and having their social media searched and then being

1189
01:12:41,205 --> 01:12:44,725
Speaker 7:  kicked outta the country for no reason whatsoever. And, and like a weird

1190
01:12:44,725 --> 01:12:48,445
Speaker 7:  combination of databases that Gabby, our reporter wrote that story called

1191
01:12:48,485 --> 01:12:52,445
Speaker 7:  a panopticon. Like there's just real pressure on freedom of speech

1192
01:12:52,445 --> 01:12:56,205
Speaker 7:  in this country right now. And Brendan remains the tip of that spear

1193
01:12:56,355 --> 01:12:59,965
Speaker 7:  because he goes after media organizations, specifically media organizations

1194
01:12:59,965 --> 01:13:03,045
Speaker 7:  that he disagrees with over and over and over again. He using power that

1195
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:06,765
Speaker 7:  he does not actually have, he concoct bullshit to express his power. So Brendan,

1196
01:13:06,825 --> 01:13:07,285
Speaker 7:  as always,

1197
01:13:08,815 --> 01:13:11,575
Speaker 7:  I know you listen, I know you get the alerts, I know that there's some intern

1198
01:13:11,575 --> 01:13:15,095
Speaker 7:  who sends you a read out of this. I know that you like it. I do.

1199
01:13:15,605 --> 01:13:18,465
Speaker 7:  You're welcome to come on the show and I'll humiliate you to your face anytime

1200
01:13:18,465 --> 01:13:22,305
Speaker 7:  you want. You can come onto coder as well, but you should answer for this

1201
01:13:22,585 --> 01:13:26,085
Speaker 7:  'cause it's real bad. That's when Brendan Carr is a dummy. Everyone's favorite

1202
01:13:26,085 --> 01:13:26,845
Speaker 7:  podcast within

1203
01:13:27,005 --> 01:13:30,125
Speaker 8:  A podcast. Wait, I have a, I have a, Brenda Carr is a dummy follow up question.

1204
01:13:31,065 --> 01:13:34,365
Speaker 8:  Is he connected at all to what happened with the Trump administration and

1205
01:13:34,365 --> 01:13:38,165
Speaker 8:  Voice of America this week? The, the sort of full shutdown of that entire

1206
01:13:38,225 --> 01:13:38,445
Speaker 8:  arm?

1207
01:13:38,885 --> 01:13:42,485
Speaker 7:  I don't think so. Okay. Lauren? I think that's somewhere else. I think Voice

1208
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:43,765
Speaker 7:  America is somewhere. I think so, yeah.

1209
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:47,565
Speaker 8:  Okay. It's very much like of a political piece though. This this

1210
01:13:47,565 --> 01:13:50,645
Speaker 8:  like just relentless shutdown of anything

1211
01:13:51,315 --> 01:13:54,365
Speaker 8:  that they perceive to be against them politically. Yeah.

1212
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:58,205
Speaker 7:  And It is funny 'cause Voice America is meant to be it like the export of

1213
01:13:58,565 --> 01:14:02,245
Speaker 7:  American cultural values. Like It is sort of meant to be propaganda.

1214
01:14:02,725 --> 01:14:06,085
Speaker 7:  Yeah. But they landed at we should do, we should tell the truth.

1215
01:14:06,665 --> 01:14:09,485
Speaker 7:  And that is uncomfortable when everything is this political and stupid. And

1216
01:14:09,485 --> 01:14:13,255
Speaker 7:  so now they're shut down. It's fine. Just let it be propaganda the

1217
01:14:13,255 --> 01:14:16,775
Speaker 7:  24 hours a day be like, you know what rules America, that's fine. I

1218
01:14:16,775 --> 01:14:19,375
Speaker 8:  Know, right? Like, go make your own propaganda. Don't shut it down.

1219
01:14:19,925 --> 01:14:20,455
Speaker 7:  Very stupid.

1220
01:14:20,655 --> 01:14:21,975
Speaker 8:  I guess that's what Joe Rogan is

1221
01:14:21,975 --> 01:14:25,935
Speaker 7:  For. All right, last one we should talk about. This one is, it seems

1222
01:14:25,935 --> 01:14:29,255
Speaker 7:  complicated 'cause I don't know exactly what anyone is trying to get except

1223
01:14:29,535 --> 01:14:29,975
Speaker 7:  yelled at,

1224
01:14:31,915 --> 01:14:34,735
Speaker 7:  but you know, the Trump administration is new. They've got new ideas about

1225
01:14:34,795 --> 01:14:38,335
Speaker 7:  ai. They got David Sachs AI Czar doing something

1226
01:14:38,335 --> 01:14:42,055
Speaker 7:  somewhere, and Lauren both open AI and Google this week

1227
01:14:42,285 --> 01:14:45,855
Speaker 7:  basically said, Hey, what if, what if there wasn't copyright law? What?

1228
01:14:46,995 --> 01:14:49,415
Speaker 7:  That's basically how I read these letters. What's going on here?

1229
01:14:50,725 --> 01:14:53,855
Speaker 12:  Yeah. So basically the White House was asking

1230
01:14:54,575 --> 01:14:58,535
Speaker 12:  companies to kind of submit comments about, you know, what should

1231
01:14:58,555 --> 01:15:02,295
Speaker 12:  we do about AI and open ai? And Google's

1232
01:15:02,455 --> 01:15:05,695
Speaker 12:  response was like, let us train on copyrighted work.

1233
01:15:06,105 --> 01:15:09,935
Speaker 12:  Let's like have some, you know, application of like fair use for

1234
01:15:10,355 --> 01:15:13,575
Speaker 12:  ai. And obviously the

1235
01:15:13,845 --> 01:15:17,575
Speaker 12:  copyright holders, like the entertainment industry

1236
01:15:17,795 --> 01:15:21,575
Speaker 12:  did not feel so great about that. And you know, a lot of

1237
01:15:21,575 --> 01:15:25,175
Speaker 12:  celebrities were speaking out against this kind of idea.

1238
01:15:26,115 --> 01:15:29,895
Speaker 12:  So, you know, just setting up kind of this big fight over

1239
01:15:30,085 --> 01:15:33,335
Speaker 12:  copyright and AI and what the government should do about it.

1240
01:15:33,845 --> 01:15:36,855
Speaker 7:  It's weird to me because there are so many pending lawsuits,

1241
01:15:37,655 --> 01:15:41,285
Speaker 7:  right? The a bunch of celebrities have sued open ai. It feels like everyone's

1242
01:15:41,285 --> 01:15:45,205
Speaker 7:  a little bit twitcher with Google. It's a harder company to sue

1243
01:15:45,225 --> 01:15:47,885
Speaker 7:  for a variety of reasons. Everyone's tied up with Google for a variety of

1244
01:15:47,885 --> 01:15:50,565
Speaker 7:  reasons. Every, every celebrity has their podcast on YouTube for God's sake.

1245
01:15:50,715 --> 01:15:54,325
Speaker 7:  What are you gonna do that without Google? But there are all of these lawsuits,

1246
01:15:55,205 --> 01:15:59,105
Speaker 7:  our company has sued cohere, there's a disclosure. We also have to deal with

1247
01:15:59,105 --> 01:16:01,265
Speaker 7:  OpenAI another weird disclosure. None of that has anything to do with us.

1248
01:16:01,605 --> 01:16:05,425
Speaker 7:  I'm just saying, you can see how even in the this tiny little context,

1249
01:16:06,345 --> 01:16:08,865
Speaker 7:  everyone's like playing different games and we'll see how these lawsuits

1250
01:16:08,865 --> 01:16:12,585
Speaker 7:  play out. And these letters feel like, Hey, what if we

1251
01:16:12,585 --> 01:16:16,145
Speaker 7:  didn't do all that and Trump just said it was okay? Like,

1252
01:16:16,745 --> 01:16:19,665
Speaker 7:  I don't understand that. Do they think they're gonna get that?

1253
01:16:20,655 --> 01:16:22,345
Speaker 7:  Like, that's what it feels like they're asking for.

1254
01:16:22,865 --> 01:16:26,825
Speaker 12:  I mean, I guess they think it's worth a shot. I mean, I think it's

1255
01:16:26,825 --> 01:16:30,505
Speaker 12:  almost like what we've seen with TikTok. You know, the courts say

1256
01:16:30,765 --> 01:16:34,225
Speaker 12:  one thing and then Trump comes in and says, no, actually I'm gonna give

1257
01:16:34,225 --> 01:16:37,785
Speaker 12:  an extension that's not written into the law. So I think, you know,

1258
01:16:38,455 --> 01:16:42,385
Speaker 12:  they're trying to go at this from all different dimensions in

1259
01:16:42,385 --> 01:16:46,225
Speaker 12:  the courts and policy, you know, in, in like actual

1260
01:16:46,255 --> 01:16:50,145
Speaker 12:  laws out of Congress. And we'll see kind of what gets

1261
01:16:50,145 --> 01:16:51,105
Speaker 12:  there first. I think

1262
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:54,705
Speaker 8:  It actually strikes me as like a perfectly reasonable thing to try. If you're

1263
01:16:54,705 --> 01:16:58,385
Speaker 8:  one of these companies. Like, it, it, it might work. Like, and,

1264
01:16:58,685 --> 01:17:01,625
Speaker 8:  and the the thing I think is so funny about all this is they're all making

1265
01:17:01,905 --> 01:17:05,545
Speaker 8:  mistakes so high. And it's like the, both Google

1266
01:17:05,685 --> 01:17:09,325
Speaker 8:  and OpenAI were like, if we, if you don't let us do whatever we want

1267
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:13,445
Speaker 8:  with everything that has ever been created in human history, China

1268
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:14,165
Speaker 8:  will win.

1269
01:17:15,955 --> 01:17:19,005
Speaker 8:  It's like, that's, that's the stakes that they're making. And then everybody

1270
01:17:19,005 --> 01:17:22,845
Speaker 8:  in Hollywood is like, if, if you don't stop them from doing this, no

1271
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:27,485
Speaker 8:  creative act will ever occur in the future ever again. And

1272
01:17:27,485 --> 01:17:31,445
Speaker 8:  it's like, what if we all just settled down a little? Like can

1273
01:17:31,445 --> 01:17:33,245
Speaker 8:  we all, it's, it's just, let's

1274
01:17:33,245 --> 01:17:36,525
Speaker 7:  Wait. In this case I kind of agree with Hollywood. I think mean I wanna be

1275
01:17:36,555 --> 01:17:39,125
Speaker 8:  Like, if, if you want me to pick a side, I'm on Hollywood's side. It's not

1276
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:39,605
Speaker 8:  close, but

1277
01:17:39,605 --> 01:17:43,265
Speaker 7:  Like It is true that the number of movies is going down, right? Like

1278
01:17:43,335 --> 01:17:47,185
Speaker 7:  it's true that we all have to, we're like pretend severance is like 10 times

1279
01:17:47,185 --> 01:17:49,225
Speaker 7:  better than It is 'cause it's the only good

1280
01:17:49,225 --> 01:17:51,505
Speaker 8:  Thing. Okay. Okay. Do you know what I mean? How dare you? First of all,

1281
01:17:51,735 --> 01:17:55,265
Speaker 7:  Like there's nothing as good as that to compare it to except the White Lotus.

1282
01:17:55,265 --> 01:17:57,785
Speaker 7:  And now we all have to pretend that shows in which nothing happens are like

1283
01:17:57,785 --> 01:18:00,585
Speaker 7:  the peak of all cinema. Throw that out there.

1284
01:18:01,865 --> 01:18:01,985
Speaker 8:  I

1285
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:02,345
Speaker 7:  Say

1286
01:18:03,425 --> 01:18:07,345
Speaker 8:  I Nila, you know, I hate you. So this, this, this brings me great

1287
01:18:07,345 --> 01:18:11,105
Speaker 8:  pain to say, but after like two episodes ago of Severance

1288
01:18:11,615 --> 01:18:14,985
Speaker 8:  Nila posted on Blue Sky, something to the effect of they made a 40 minute

1289
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:18,705
Speaker 8:  episode of Severance in which the first 12 minutes is her going to a place

1290
01:18:18,845 --> 01:18:22,505
Speaker 8:  asking for a ride to a place to get another ride to another place. And I

1291
01:18:22,505 --> 01:18:26,345
Speaker 8:  have, I, I have laughed thinking about that post every single day

1292
01:18:26,345 --> 01:18:28,425
Speaker 8:  since then. Ben, Ben still have replied to that

1293
01:18:28,425 --> 01:18:31,785
Speaker 7:  Post. Ben Stiller did not laugh at that post. Feel great. Very good. Ben,

1294
01:18:31,785 --> 01:18:34,345
Speaker 7:  you're also welcome on the road cast. It'll go, it'll go better for you.

1295
01:18:34,505 --> 01:18:38,105
Speaker 7:  I like severance. I like the show. My point is just, we make so fewer

1296
01:18:38,195 --> 01:18:42,105
Speaker 7:  shows that the bar is like, we have to

1297
01:18:42,105 --> 01:18:45,945
Speaker 7:  pretend that like asking for a ride is like the peak of all

1298
01:18:45,945 --> 01:18:49,265
Speaker 7:  television art and like maybe it isn't. Yeah. And so I'm just, I'm just saying

1299
01:18:49,265 --> 01:18:52,625
Speaker 7:  Hollywood might have a point here. We should make some more stuff. We should,

1300
01:18:52,685 --> 01:18:54,145
Speaker 7:  we should not be in this situation.

1301
01:18:54,495 --> 01:18:58,065
Speaker 8:  True. But Lauren, to your point, like if, if I'm one of these

1302
01:18:58,345 --> 01:19:02,185
Speaker 8:  companies, I would very much like to be excluded from the

1303
01:19:02,185 --> 01:19:06,025
Speaker 8:  deep hate toward big tech. And I have to like all that is

1304
01:19:06,025 --> 01:19:09,545
Speaker 8:  still coming for these companies. And I, I if, if I'm open ai, I would super

1305
01:19:09,545 --> 01:19:13,105
Speaker 8:  love to just kind of be over here. It's like, maybe, maybe use all the deregulation

1306
01:19:13,105 --> 01:19:15,905
Speaker 8:  you're doing again on me and not, I

1307
01:19:15,905 --> 01:19:18,185
Speaker 7:  Would big, I just dunno what the outcome. Isn't it like, can you imagine

1308
01:19:18,195 --> 01:19:21,985
Speaker 7:  Trump issuing an executive order that's like, I have decided that AI is fair

1309
01:19:22,005 --> 01:19:22,225
Speaker 7:  use.

1310
01:19:22,845 --> 01:19:23,065
Speaker 8:  Yes.

1311
01:19:23,885 --> 01:19:24,385
Speaker 7:  But like

1312
01:19:24,745 --> 01:19:26,545
Speaker 8:  A hundred Yes. Whatcha talking about?

1313
01:19:27,575 --> 01:19:29,425
Speaker 7:  Sure, sure. We

1314
01:19:29,455 --> 01:19:31,185
Speaker 8:  It's the Gulf of America now.

1315
01:19:32,775 --> 01:19:33,265
Speaker 7:  Whatcha

1316
01:19:33,265 --> 01:19:33,985
Speaker 8:  Talking about?

1317
01:19:34,815 --> 01:19:38,785
Speaker 7:  Sure. But like, all right, I just, there's

1318
01:19:38,785 --> 01:19:42,505
Speaker 7:  a part of me that where he knows he still gets royalties from The Apprentice,

1319
01:19:42,605 --> 01:19:45,065
Speaker 7:  you know what I mean? Like he knows where his money comes from

1320
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:49,715
Speaker 7:  and that one's particularly hard. Like I have personally like,

1321
01:19:51,075 --> 01:19:54,865
Speaker 7:  intervened in a bunch of active court cases I don't really care about. He

1322
01:19:54,865 --> 01:19:57,745
Speaker 7:  is, it's much more likely that he would do Gulf America. I dunno. Lauren,

1323
01:19:57,745 --> 01:20:00,305
Speaker 7:  what do you think the end game is here? Just like give it a shot?

1324
01:20:00,785 --> 01:20:04,505
Speaker 12:  I think so. I mean, I think they're gonna try to say

1325
01:20:04,505 --> 01:20:08,285
Speaker 12:  something on AI one way or another. So the company is want to

1326
01:20:08,315 --> 01:20:12,085
Speaker 12:  make sure that their point of view and you know, to David's point,

1327
01:20:12,085 --> 01:20:15,605
Speaker 12:  maybe the most hysterical version of that point of view is heard.

1328
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:20,205
Speaker 7:  All right, we'll see, I mean, I'm very excited for Trump to weigh in on 17

1329
01:20:20,285 --> 01:20:24,045
Speaker 7:  USC 1 0 7 specifically by statute. Look, there's a bunch of other

1330
01:20:24,245 --> 01:20:28,005
Speaker 7:  politics stuff on the website. It is a heated time in

1331
01:20:28,005 --> 01:20:31,085
Speaker 7:  America. It should be obvious to anybody who's paying attention. We have

1332
01:20:31,085 --> 01:20:33,965
Speaker 7:  a great story to speak about. Doge straining all the US A ID workers with

1333
01:20:34,035 --> 01:20:37,645
Speaker 7:  like work laptops full of data with no plan to recover them. We got stories

1334
01:20:37,645 --> 01:20:40,485
Speaker 7:  about this Tesla Takedown protests, which are starting to have a real effect

1335
01:20:40,485 --> 01:20:41,565
Speaker 7:  on that, on that stock price.

1336
01:20:43,425 --> 01:20:47,365
Speaker 7:  One of the dumbest things that keeps happening in this administration is

1337
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:51,425
Speaker 7:  they just keep removing webpages by searching

1338
01:20:51,445 --> 01:20:54,585
Speaker 7:  for words that mean other things. And so like

1339
01:20:55,345 --> 01:20:58,025
Speaker 7:  a bunch of black soldiers got removed from the Department of Defense website

1340
01:20:58,025 --> 01:21:01,105
Speaker 7:  because they just added the phrase DEI to the URLs and then broke all the

1341
01:21:01,225 --> 01:21:04,865
Speaker 7:  URLs. Like all this stuff is just like relentlessly happening. We're covering

1342
01:21:04,865 --> 01:21:08,665
Speaker 7:  it. I know a lot of our listeners and a lot of our audience

1343
01:21:08,795 --> 01:21:11,705
Speaker 7:  would like a break from it. We're gonna add some filtering to the website,

1344
01:21:11,845 --> 01:21:15,825
Speaker 7:  but we're not gonna stop covering it. I, I wanna say that as clearly as I

1345
01:21:15,825 --> 01:21:19,785
Speaker 7:  can. This is the story the government is breaking and a lot of It is breaking

1346
01:21:19,785 --> 01:21:23,705
Speaker 7:  because the tech industry is insisting that it get broken in the form of

1347
01:21:23,705 --> 01:21:27,065
Speaker 7:  Elon Musk. Yes. But also in the form of Google just writing a letter saying,

1348
01:21:27,065 --> 01:21:30,945
Speaker 7:  what if Cop lab go away. What do you think?

1349
01:21:31,325 --> 01:21:34,705
Speaker 7:  And it just, it it, all of that keeps relentlessly happening. So we're gonna

1350
01:21:34,705 --> 01:21:38,305
Speaker 7:  keep covering it on, we have to build some stuff, we have some big ideas

1351
01:21:38,305 --> 01:21:40,065
Speaker 7:  about how to filter through the site. So we're gonna build those tools for

1352
01:21:40,065 --> 01:21:43,745
Speaker 7:  you as well. We'll do some RSS stuff. We can do that pretty fast, but I just

1353
01:21:43,745 --> 01:21:46,545
Speaker 7:  wanna say clearly we're gonna keep covering it. Lauren is doing a great job

1354
01:21:46,685 --> 01:21:49,105
Speaker 7:  of leading a bunch of that coverage. So thank you so much Lauren. Lauren,

1355
01:21:49,185 --> 01:21:51,905
Speaker 8:  I should also warn you that you're, you're gonna be on this show a lot in

1356
01:21:51,905 --> 01:21:55,145
Speaker 8:  the next six weeks. And I'm really sorry in advance. You're also gonna be

1357
01:21:55,145 --> 01:21:58,585
Speaker 8:  in courtrooms a lot in the next six weeks. And I'm also really sorry in advance.

1358
01:21:58,645 --> 01:22:02,385
Speaker 8:  Yes, thank you. But it's, it's about to be a wild spring for

1359
01:22:02,445 --> 01:22:05,265
Speaker 8:  you in particular. And, and we're, we're gonna be hanging out a lot.

1360
01:22:06,215 --> 01:22:07,545
Speaker 12:  April's gonna be a crazy month.

1361
01:22:07,985 --> 01:22:08,145
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

1362
01:22:09,135 --> 01:22:12,025
Speaker 7:  Will we make tiktoks about it? Who knows? We'll find out on April 6th.

1363
01:22:12,765 --> 01:22:14,185
Speaker 7:  Lauren, thank you so much for being on.

1364
01:22:14,525 --> 01:22:14,945
Speaker 12:  Thanks.

1365
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:16,345
Speaker 7:  We'll be right back.

1366
01:23:58,015 --> 01:23:59,665
Speaker 7:  it's getting more embarrassing every time. The

1367
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:02,505
Speaker 8:  Calls for t-shirts keep coming in and they've gotten to the point where there

1368
01:24:02,505 --> 01:24:05,705
Speaker 8:  are several people who are now annoyed at me for bringing up t-shirts and

1369
01:24:05,705 --> 01:24:09,545
Speaker 8:  not making the t-shirts. If you have an unsponsored

1370
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:13,025
Speaker 8:  for flavored t-shirt design, I would love to see it.

1371
01:24:13,255 --> 01:24:16,925
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I I that's, that's all I can tell you. I don't know. I have no promises

1372
01:24:16,925 --> 01:24:18,165
Speaker 8:  on what will happen with it,

1373
01:24:19,945 --> 01:24:23,445
Speaker 8:  but I, I personally want both an unsponsored for flavor

1374
01:24:24,175 --> 01:24:28,045
Speaker 8:  shirt that looks like I'm an unsponsored skateboarder and I want an everything's

1375
01:24:28,165 --> 01:24:31,165
Speaker 8:  computer t-shirt. I can't promise that either of those will exist or that

1376
01:24:31,165 --> 01:24:33,285
Speaker 8:  we will do them, but I want them both in my life very badly.

1377
01:24:33,725 --> 01:24:37,185
Speaker 7:  I understand. I mean, you know, the implication is that when we're

1378
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:41,225
Speaker 7:  sponsored there's less flavor, which is just not, it would repeat to

1379
01:24:41,385 --> 01:24:45,265
Speaker 7:  everyone that it's fine because we exist in the, you know, the, the

1380
01:24:45,265 --> 01:24:49,185
Speaker 7:  creator economy writ large. And I, I think for

1381
01:24:49,185 --> 01:24:52,585
Speaker 7:  many folks the sponsorship does reduce flavor.

1382
01:24:53,735 --> 01:24:57,595
Speaker 7:  But that's not us. 'cause we, we have this annoyingly precious ethics policy.

1383
01:24:57,605 --> 01:24:58,835
Speaker 7:  Right. It's just a difference. And what,

1384
01:24:59,135 --> 01:24:59,595
Speaker 8:  That's all.

1385
01:24:59,745 --> 01:25:02,835
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it's still, I still directly challenge

1386
01:25:04,275 --> 01:25:07,435
Speaker 7:  FCC commissioners to humiliation rituals on the show. You can sponsor it

1387
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:10,835
Speaker 7:  or not. It's gonna keep happening no matter what. All right. I was gonna

1388
01:25:11,145 --> 01:25:12,435
Speaker 8:  Brought to you by the FCC,

1389
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:20,835
Speaker 7:  If we can ever pull like the, an executive from an ISP on one

1390
01:25:20,835 --> 01:25:23,705
Speaker 7:  of our shows, I'll be like, have you unsponsored.

1391
01:25:24,695 --> 01:25:28,385
Speaker 7:  Alright. I wanted to stop talking about Elon in politics, but the first item

1392
01:25:28,385 --> 01:25:31,665
Speaker 7:  in the lightning round, it demands it. There's no other place in the show

1393
01:25:31,685 --> 01:25:35,325
Speaker 7:  for this sentence to go. Tesla recalls more than

1394
01:25:35,325 --> 01:25:38,645
Speaker 7:  46,000 Cybertrucks after trim starts falling off.

1395
01:25:39,985 --> 01:25:41,285
Speaker 7:  Is that all of them?

1396
01:25:42,955 --> 01:25:46,895
Speaker 7:  It seems like a lot of them It does. It it sure does. I don't think

1397
01:25:46,895 --> 01:25:50,255
Speaker 7:  they sold a lot. They, they've been sitting on lots. We've known the trim

1398
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:54,125
Speaker 7:  has been falling off for seven months. YouTubers have making videos

1399
01:25:54,135 --> 01:25:57,525
Speaker 7:  about the trim. You know, it's the triangle piece. It's just glued on there,

1400
01:25:57,955 --> 01:26:01,365
Speaker 7:  like the part that goes over the window. It's been flying all these cars

1401
01:26:01,815 --> 01:26:05,685
Speaker 7:  since the first day. Like we've known for a long time that this piece

1402
01:26:05,685 --> 01:26:09,085
Speaker 7:  falls off the cars and we're only getting the recall now.

1403
01:26:10,545 --> 01:26:13,355
Speaker 7:  Cool. A recall applies to every cyber truck manufacturer between

1404
01:26:13,555 --> 01:26:17,515
Speaker 7:  November 13th, 2023, February 27th, 2025. It's

1405
01:26:17,515 --> 01:26:21,015
Speaker 7:  the eighth recall. A lot of them were software, but

1406
01:26:21,495 --> 01:26:25,455
Speaker 7:  a similar recall was announced last summer regarding a trim fault and a truck

1407
01:26:25,455 --> 01:26:26,735
Speaker 7:  bed that also risked coming loose.

1408
01:26:27,205 --> 01:26:31,175
Speaker 8:  This car is not super well made. It does not seem to

1409
01:26:31,175 --> 01:26:32,935
Speaker 8:  be the, the, the takeaway here.

1410
01:26:33,195 --> 01:26:37,135
Speaker 7:  It does not seem great. I think one of the more interesting things about

1411
01:26:37,135 --> 01:26:40,975
Speaker 7:  Tesla right now, and we don't have to overdo It, is that the bloom is coming

1412
01:26:41,175 --> 01:26:44,255
Speaker 7:  off the roads such that YouTubers are starting to chase the company.

1413
01:26:45,915 --> 01:26:49,575
Speaker 7:  So there's, you know, there's a Mark Rober video this week about

1414
01:26:49,845 --> 01:26:53,095
Speaker 7:  autopilot and lidar and there's a lot of weirdness with that video. We don't

1415
01:26:53,095 --> 01:26:56,975
Speaker 7:  have to like over talk it, but there's just some, like when he drives

1416
01:26:56,975 --> 01:26:59,775
Speaker 7:  the car through the, the wall, if you've seen the video, he drives

1417
01:27:00,975 --> 01:27:04,895
Speaker 7:  Tesla through a wall that's like a Wiley Coyote painting of a more

1418
01:27:04,895 --> 01:27:08,135
Speaker 7:  road. 'cause the cameras, 'cause the thesis is the cameras won't be able

1419
01:27:08,135 --> 01:27:11,415
Speaker 7:  to detect the wall because they, they just use visions Sea Road

1420
01:27:11,925 --> 01:27:15,815
Speaker 7:  when he drives through it, it like is a Looney Tunes cutout of like a

1421
01:27:15,815 --> 01:27:18,495
Speaker 7:  thing you would drive through. Like there's, it's an entertainment piece.

1422
01:27:18,555 --> 01:27:21,975
Speaker 7:  You can tell that it's an entertainment piece. But there's that you can see

1423
01:27:22,435 --> 01:27:25,135
Speaker 7:  jig, everything has been really harsh on the cyber truck lately.

1424
01:27:26,085 --> 01:27:30,055
Speaker 7:  Marquez has been posting about his Roadster pre-order that It is never

1425
01:27:30,295 --> 01:27:33,535
Speaker 7:  shipping. I think he wrote age like milk over screenshot of it. You're just

1426
01:27:33,535 --> 01:27:37,095
Speaker 7:  seeing, it's like, it's fine now in a way that, you know, they're still getting

1427
01:27:37,115 --> 01:27:40,895
Speaker 7:  intact and there's quite a lot of angst about it. But it, it's just

1428
01:27:40,895 --> 01:27:44,775
Speaker 7:  fine now to point out the problems with this, these this, this company

1429
01:27:44,795 --> 01:27:48,135
Speaker 7:  and its cars. And that is, that's a pretty big change.

1430
01:27:48,405 --> 01:27:51,575
Speaker 8:  Yeah. John Herman at our, our friend at New York Mag wrote a really good

1431
01:27:51,575 --> 01:27:55,455
Speaker 8:  piece about this this week basically looking at that turn

1432
01:27:55,635 --> 01:27:59,455
Speaker 8:  and at, at how long Tesla

1433
01:27:59,845 --> 01:28:03,215
Speaker 8:  kept this thing where it was sort of a universally praised

1434
01:28:03,505 --> 01:28:07,215
Speaker 8:  thing in that space. And it was, it was considered sort of this

1435
01:28:07,535 --> 01:28:11,375
Speaker 8:  standard thing to do to like Tesla, like every tech

1436
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:15,095
Speaker 8:  YouTuber loved Elon Musk and loved Tesla. And it was like, it represented

1437
01:28:15,095 --> 01:28:19,055
Speaker 8:  everything that people in that space believed in.

1438
01:28:19,355 --> 01:28:20,615
Speaker 8:  And that has completely shifted.

1439
01:28:20,885 --> 01:28:24,415
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It just totally flipped. Yeah. And you know the, the protests, I think

1440
01:28:24,755 --> 01:28:28,615
Speaker 7:  we, I interviewed Ed Meyer who wrote ludicrous the inside story of Tesla

1441
01:28:28,675 --> 01:28:32,535
Speaker 7:  Motors. He's one of the leaders that Tesla Takedown protest movement. And

1442
01:28:32,535 --> 01:28:35,575
Speaker 7:  I'm just gonna say this clear, he said on the show he disavows any vandalism

1443
01:28:35,575 --> 01:28:39,295
Speaker 7:  or violence. I asked him directly, he said it this is is like the bot comment

1444
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:42,895
Speaker 7:  of the day about Tesla protests. Yeah. I asked him and he said don't do

1445
01:28:42,895 --> 01:28:46,095
Speaker 7:  vandalism or violence, but those protests are having an impact 'cause people

1446
01:28:46,095 --> 01:28:49,575
Speaker 7:  are starting to, the bloom is coming off the roads of the brand and now investors,

1447
01:28:49,715 --> 01:28:52,975
Speaker 7:  big investors are starting to say things like, Elon needs to pay attention

1448
01:28:52,975 --> 01:28:56,775
Speaker 7:  to Tesla. We'll see how it plays out. I'm just, I'm just

1449
01:28:56,775 --> 01:29:00,015
Speaker 7:  pointing out the cyber truck continues to be one of the funniest cars ever

1450
01:29:00,015 --> 01:29:00,135
Speaker 7:  made.

1451
01:29:01,985 --> 01:29:05,965
Speaker 7:  Big silly wiper. You my guys. Alright David, do you know

1452
01:29:05,965 --> 01:29:09,945
Speaker 7:  what's going on with this book? This Careless People book it, it's like

1453
01:29:09,965 --> 01:29:13,945
Speaker 7:  it keeps crossing my path. I have a copy of it. It just seems like Meta

1454
01:29:13,945 --> 01:29:17,425
Speaker 7:  wanted this book to go away. 'cause it's a book about Mark Zuckerberg and

1455
01:29:17,425 --> 01:29:21,185
Speaker 7:  Meta and now it's at the top of the New York Times best

1456
01:29:21,335 --> 01:29:21,625
Speaker 7:  list.

1457
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:25,505
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I mean it It is, It is like an all time streisand effect moment

1458
01:29:26,635 --> 01:29:30,585
Speaker 8:  where Sarah Wynn Williams writes this book about her time at

1459
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:30,905
Speaker 8:  Meta

1460
01:29:32,495 --> 01:29:36,345
Speaker 8:  that meta I think perceived to be, you know,

1461
01:29:37,065 --> 01:29:40,705
Speaker 8:  disastrously terrible and full of lies. And so entered

1462
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:44,625
Speaker 8:  into this big fight to try and issue an injunction to prevent her

1463
01:29:44,655 --> 01:29:48,265
Speaker 8:  from, from promoting and distributing the book. It became this whole thing.

1464
01:29:48,265 --> 01:29:51,065
Speaker 8:  The publisher came out and said, you know, we, we defend what's in the book.

1465
01:29:51,065 --> 01:29:54,825
Speaker 8:  This has been carefully vetted. Increasingly people

1466
01:29:54,965 --> 01:29:57,985
Speaker 8:  who are reading the book seemed to be

1467
01:29:59,345 --> 01:30:02,985
Speaker 8:  a vouching for a lot of it. That that what she is writing is, is true.

1468
01:30:03,545 --> 01:30:06,225
Speaker 8:  I have not read the book so I can't say for sure, but I know Alex Heath on

1469
01:30:06,225 --> 01:30:09,585
Speaker 8:  our team has one and has been talking to people about it. The book is just

1470
01:30:09,585 --> 01:30:13,105
Speaker 8:  out, you can just read it. I should read it this weekend. But

1471
01:30:13,445 --> 01:30:17,385
Speaker 8:  by all accounts, it It is actually, it's it's a good book

1472
01:30:17,385 --> 01:30:21,105
Speaker 8:  full of real allegations and implications about

1473
01:30:21,165 --> 01:30:25,145
Speaker 8:  the workplace at Meta. Some of them about, you

1474
01:30:25,145 --> 01:30:26,425
Speaker 8:  know, harassment and real problems.

1475
01:30:27,935 --> 01:30:31,825
Speaker 8:  Meta has just played this exactly the worst possible way if you're meta and

1476
01:30:32,035 --> 01:30:35,585
Speaker 8:  don't want people to read this book because now like you said, It is a number

1477
01:30:35,585 --> 01:30:38,905
Speaker 8:  one bestseller, which for I would say for even a pretty

1478
01:30:39,215 --> 01:30:43,065
Speaker 8:  splashy like memoir of a person's experience inside of a company is pretty

1479
01:30:43,065 --> 01:30:47,025
Speaker 8:  unusual. Yeah. To to be a number one bestseller is not an easy thing to

1480
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:47,425
Speaker 8:  pull off.

1481
01:30:49,005 --> 01:30:52,865
Speaker 8:  And now this, this book is a huge story. It is, I think

1482
01:30:53,325 --> 01:30:57,225
Speaker 8:  the book itself is a bigger story than anything in the book at the

1483
01:30:57,225 --> 01:31:00,865
Speaker 8:  moment, which is really interesting. Like the, this fight I think has subsumed

1484
01:31:00,895 --> 01:31:04,705
Speaker 8:  some of the conversation about like the allegations of what has gone gone

1485
01:31:04,705 --> 01:31:08,505
Speaker 8:  on inside of meta, which is a weird way to have

1486
01:31:08,505 --> 01:31:12,465
Speaker 8:  this conversation go. But it's, it's, it's very much out there

1487
01:31:12,465 --> 01:31:16,145
Speaker 8:  now and I suspect I like many others will be reading

1488
01:31:16,295 --> 01:31:19,905
Speaker 8:  this book much more carefully and enthusiastically than I would've

1489
01:31:19,905 --> 01:31:20,305
Speaker 8:  otherwise.

1490
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:24,625
Speaker 7:  Yeah. The the weird thing about It is that meta, they

1491
01:31:24,625 --> 01:31:28,265
Speaker 7:  pulled out her like arbitration agreement went to an

1492
01:31:28,265 --> 01:31:31,945
Speaker 7:  arbitrator and said she's not allowed to promote the book and then the publisher

1493
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:35,625
Speaker 7:  of the book and then the meta completely

1494
01:31:35,715 --> 01:31:39,025
Speaker 7:  overstated that ruling and they're like, we've in vindicated this book as

1495
01:31:39,025 --> 01:31:42,465
Speaker 7:  lies, which is not what the ruling said. And then the publisher of the book

1496
01:31:42,465 --> 01:31:44,665
Speaker 7:  is like, look, that has nothing to do with us. We're gonna continue promoting

1497
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:48,465
Speaker 7:  the book. So we're in this weird limbo, we're meta you know,

1498
01:31:48,595 --> 01:31:51,785
Speaker 7:  we're doing free speech now. We're gonna use community notes. Everything's

1499
01:31:51,785 --> 01:31:55,465
Speaker 7:  wide open on meta platforms, is actively trying to shut down speech. And

1500
01:31:55,465 --> 01:31:58,345
Speaker 7:  the thing that happens when you actively try to shut down speech is definitely

1501
01:31:58,345 --> 01:32:01,005
Speaker 7:  happening. Which is everyone is curious about the thing they're not supposed

1502
01:32:01,005 --> 01:32:01,285
Speaker 7:  to read.

1503
01:32:01,715 --> 01:32:02,285
Speaker 8:  Yeah, right.

1504
01:32:02,745 --> 01:32:03,565
Speaker 7:  It just never works.

1505
01:32:04,105 --> 01:32:04,325
Speaker 8:  No,

1506
01:32:04,905 --> 01:32:08,885
Speaker 7:  And I, it of all of the companies who should know this meta should know this

1507
01:32:08,885 --> 01:32:12,805
Speaker 7:  and they're like Andy Stone, like meta comms is like on threads

1508
01:32:12,805 --> 01:32:15,805
Speaker 7:  every day being like replying to anyone who says anything about this book

1509
01:32:15,805 --> 01:32:19,205
Speaker 7:  being like, this book is lies Right. How

1510
01:32:19,205 --> 01:32:19,525
Speaker 8:  Dare you.

1511
01:32:19,555 --> 01:32:22,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And it's just like, what are you doing? Like what, what, what has you

1512
01:32:22,485 --> 01:32:25,005
Speaker 7:  so worked up? And maybe It is all lies but this isn't,

1513
01:32:25,065 --> 01:32:28,005
Speaker 8:  But then you get people like Dustin Moskovitz, one of the co-founders of

1514
01:32:28,605 --> 01:32:32,245
Speaker 8:  Facebook saying essentially that he

1515
01:32:32,445 --> 01:32:35,965
Speaker 8:  encourages everybody to read the book and that there are lots of allegations

1516
01:32:36,165 --> 01:32:39,885
Speaker 8:  in there. But that actually inside of all of that is a really interesting

1517
01:32:39,885 --> 01:32:43,405
Speaker 8:  and telling Reid about how the company works and how the

1518
01:32:43,405 --> 01:32:46,805
Speaker 8:  personalities inside of the company operate. Like there's a lot about

1519
01:32:47,225 --> 01:32:50,845
Speaker 8:  Sheryl Sandberg and a lot about Joel Kaplan and like, it, it seems to be,

1520
01:32:50,845 --> 01:32:52,725
Speaker 8:  again, I have not read the book, we should talk about this once we've both

1521
01:32:52,725 --> 01:32:56,645
Speaker 8:  read it. But that there is a lot of just

1522
01:32:56,645 --> 01:33:00,405
Speaker 8:  sort of interesting business memoir inside of here that is not super flattering

1523
01:33:00,405 --> 01:33:04,205
Speaker 8:  to meta that now an awful lot of people are going to be exposed

1524
01:33:04,225 --> 01:33:07,885
Speaker 8:  to. 'cause there is, there, there is I think a really interesting

1525
01:33:08,155 --> 01:33:10,645
Speaker 8:  version of this story that is like there are big

1526
01:33:11,555 --> 01:33:14,965
Speaker 8:  problematic allegations that will get talked about and we'll get run through

1527
01:33:15,065 --> 01:33:18,525
Speaker 8:  the, the press and will be become the story. But then there are,

1528
01:33:19,085 --> 01:33:22,925
Speaker 8:  I think the sort of lingering legacy of books like this is they do

1529
01:33:22,925 --> 01:33:26,845
Speaker 8:  start to big picture change the way you understand how companies like

1530
01:33:26,845 --> 01:33:30,805
Speaker 8:  this work. And I think we might get to that

1531
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:34,925
Speaker 8:  legacy much faster because this has become such a big story that It is like,

1532
01:33:34,925 --> 01:33:38,725
Speaker 8:  oh if for meta to be this upset about this must mean she's telling the truth.

1533
01:33:39,025 --> 01:33:42,965
Speaker 8:  And that becomes really powerful. Yeah. And I, I think like we're, this book

1534
01:33:42,965 --> 01:33:46,765
Speaker 8:  is going to have really interesting different impact even from

1535
01:33:46,825 --> 01:33:50,165
Speaker 8:  the sort of immediately headline grabbing allegations that it makes.

1536
01:33:50,385 --> 01:33:52,925
Speaker 7:  You know what's interesting is, you know, I flipped through the galley, I

1537
01:33:52,925 --> 01:33:56,085
Speaker 7:  haven't read it closely, but I flipped through the galley and I've read a

1538
01:33:56,085 --> 01:33:59,885
Speaker 7:  bunch of stories about the book and some of the experts and what's fascinating

1539
01:33:59,885 --> 01:34:02,965
Speaker 7:  about It is it makes meta seem really small and personality driven. Like

1540
01:34:02,965 --> 01:34:05,965
Speaker 7:  Mark Zuckerberg is fiddling with individual content moderation decisions.

1541
01:34:07,655 --> 01:34:11,025
Speaker 7:  Various executives are very personally driving the company,

1542
01:34:11,035 --> 01:34:13,025
Speaker 8:  Which is the opposite of how Meta wants you to think about it.

1543
01:34:13,025 --> 01:34:15,185
Speaker 7:  Right? Meta wants to be a government. Right. Right. Like that's how they,

1544
01:34:15,185 --> 01:34:19,065
Speaker 7:  they set up a Supreme Court for God's sake. Nobody cares about, I

1545
01:34:19,065 --> 01:34:22,985
Speaker 7:  would compare that to Mark Bergen, who's a great journalist, I think It

1546
01:34:22,985 --> 01:34:26,025
Speaker 7:  is a Bloomberg. He wrote a book about YouTube called Light Comment, subscribe.

1547
01:34:26,025 --> 01:34:28,905
Speaker 7:  He was on decoder. You can listen to the interview. I love this book. It's

1548
01:34:28,905 --> 01:34:32,825
Speaker 7:  a good book because it makes YouTube seem big like the scale

1549
01:34:32,845 --> 01:34:36,185
Speaker 7:  of the problem that YouTube has to solve with content moderation, with what

1550
01:34:36,185 --> 01:34:39,785
Speaker 7:  It is with the interface. All this stuff, particularly under Susan Moki,

1551
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:44,355
Speaker 7:  it, the book doesn't shy away from the problem and it's deeply reported.

1552
01:34:44,355 --> 01:34:47,915
Speaker 7:  It's in the weeds of YouTube and it makes the case somewhat

1553
01:34:48,075 --> 01:34:51,915
Speaker 7:  persuasively that YouTube has a shitload of problems and that like

1554
01:34:51,915 --> 01:34:55,275
Speaker 7:  all these people are stressed to the max every single day. But the reason

1555
01:34:55,275 --> 01:34:59,045
Speaker 7:  YouTube is perceived to be slow is because they're taking it seriously.

1556
01:34:59,095 --> 01:35:02,965
Speaker 7:  Right. I can issue criticisms of YouTube all day, all night and maybe

1557
01:35:02,965 --> 01:35:05,365
Speaker 7:  we'll do that in another episode of the show. But it was just interesting

1558
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:08,885
Speaker 7:  comparing contrasting these, these two books and what you're saying about

1559
01:35:08,885 --> 01:35:12,525
Speaker 7:  the narratives that take hold of a company like that book is very, very

1560
01:35:12,805 --> 01:35:15,125
Speaker 7:  critical of YouTube. And I really do encourage people to radio or listen

1561
01:35:15,205 --> 01:35:19,125
Speaker 7:  to Episode of Coder, but it, you just, it it conveys the

1562
01:35:19,125 --> 01:35:22,885
Speaker 7:  scale of the problem and it makes YouTube seem big in comparison to that

1563
01:35:22,885 --> 01:35:26,765
Speaker 7:  scale. And I think the reason Meta hates this book is it makes 'em all

1564
01:35:26,765 --> 01:35:30,615
Speaker 7:  seem small. Hmm. And Alex is, Alex Heath is reading,

1565
01:35:30,615 --> 01:35:33,215
Speaker 7:  he is doing some reporting to try to figure out what's happening. Some of

1566
01:35:33,215 --> 01:35:35,655
Speaker 7:  these claims we'll have more of that. We'll probably have him come talk about

1567
01:35:35,655 --> 01:35:38,735
Speaker 7:  the show next week or a week after when he is done with that process. But

1568
01:35:39,235 --> 01:35:42,495
Speaker 7:  that's just my, my read of It is like, oh these guys hate it when you make

1569
01:35:42,615 --> 01:35:46,335
Speaker 7:  'em seem small. Yeah. Speaking of meta, there's a little bit of activity.

1570
01:35:46,475 --> 01:35:49,575
Speaker 7:  Pub news, ugh. After a big run for Blue Sky

1571
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:55,355
Speaker 7:  Activity Pub. Well some glimmers. So the May maybe the most important one

1572
01:35:55,595 --> 01:35:59,035
Speaker 7:  in terms of meta threads by the way Sports Activity Pub threads is now gonna

1573
01:35:59,035 --> 01:36:02,995
Speaker 7:  let you set your following feed by default. Just five years

1574
01:36:03,015 --> 01:36:04,235
Speaker 7:  too late. But they're gonna do it

1575
01:36:05,825 --> 01:36:07,635
Speaker 8:  Five years too late for a 2-year-old product.

1576
01:36:08,455 --> 01:36:11,635
Speaker 7:  It feels right they're gonna do it. I think that's, I think that's smart.

1577
01:36:13,035 --> 01:36:15,475
Speaker 7:  I think they've lost a lot of juice to Blue Sky.

1578
01:36:15,815 --> 01:36:19,475
Speaker 8:  Yes. I think threads in a really funny way. I think

1579
01:36:19,915 --> 01:36:23,675
Speaker 8:  I thought Threads was sort of speed running Instagram where it was gonna

1580
01:36:23,735 --> 01:36:27,715
Speaker 8:  go and become this sort of central platform. Everybody was very quickly

1581
01:36:28,015 --> 01:36:30,995
Speaker 8:  and what it actually looks like it's doing is, is speed running Facebook

1582
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:34,555
Speaker 8:  where it becomes the thing that everybody is on but no one pays attention

1583
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:37,355
Speaker 8:  to really quickly. And I think

1584
01:36:38,745 --> 01:36:41,595
Speaker 8:  Meta does not wanna build another Facebook, even though Facebook has been

1585
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:44,835
Speaker 8:  very good to meta for a really long time. Like that is a dying thing and

1586
01:36:44,835 --> 01:36:46,835
Speaker 8:  you don't want to get to the end state of that very quickly.

1587
01:36:48,495 --> 01:36:52,155
Speaker 8:  And yeah, I think they are desperate to make threads a place people want

1588
01:36:52,155 --> 01:36:55,035
Speaker 8:  to hang out in the way that Blue Sky is a place people want to hang out.

1589
01:36:55,185 --> 01:36:58,795
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And the size advantage it has is real,

1590
01:36:58,845 --> 01:37:02,715
Speaker 8:  right? Like they continue to dominate in terms of like raw

1591
01:37:02,715 --> 01:37:06,475
Speaker 8:  number of users and people who and whatever. But like Blue Sky is more fun

1592
01:37:07,175 --> 01:37:10,995
Speaker 8:  and, and like I we're in so many ways

1593
01:37:11,585 --> 01:37:15,355
Speaker 8:  what Facebook was to Twitter, which is vastly bigger and

1594
01:37:15,355 --> 01:37:18,515
Speaker 8:  totally irrelevant threads now risks becoming to Blue Sky.

1595
01:37:19,695 --> 01:37:23,555
Speaker 8:  And if I'm Mark Zuckerberg and Adam Aria, I am like fighting tooth and

1596
01:37:23,555 --> 01:37:27,115
Speaker 8:  nail to make sure that doesn't happen. And the best thing that that has led

1597
01:37:27,115 --> 01:37:30,675
Speaker 8:  to is better product. This truly like this thing

1598
01:37:30,765 --> 01:37:34,555
Speaker 8:  where you can just see your following feed does not happen if

1599
01:37:34,555 --> 01:37:38,155
Speaker 8:  Blue Sky doesn't exist. And without question it just doesn't because this

1600
01:37:38,155 --> 01:37:42,035
Speaker 8:  company has very specific ideas about what it believes is best and is best

1601
01:37:42,035 --> 01:37:45,755
Speaker 8:  for engagement and the following feed is not good for

1602
01:37:45,755 --> 01:37:49,395
Speaker 8:  engagement. It just isn't. And it doesn't matter because they need people

1603
01:37:49,395 --> 01:37:53,355
Speaker 8:  to use the platform. Yeah. And, and it's so, it's so

1604
01:37:53,355 --> 01:37:57,005
Speaker 8:  good that this, that there is real meaningful competition here because it's

1605
01:37:57,005 --> 01:37:59,365
Speaker 8:  forcing everybody's hands to actually build better products.

1606
01:38:00,085 --> 01:38:03,645
Speaker 7:  I honestly think one of the, the biggest successes of the TikTok

1607
01:38:03,645 --> 01:38:07,605
Speaker 7:  algorithm is that It is divorced from time, but it

1608
01:38:07,605 --> 01:38:11,085
Speaker 7:  still manages to feel relevant. Mm. Right. The the, there's something

1609
01:38:11,185 --> 01:38:15,085
Speaker 7:  really good about that algorithm where you're like, some

1610
01:38:15,085 --> 01:38:18,925
Speaker 7:  news happened today and like you see it on TikTok in the algorithm pretty

1611
01:38:18,925 --> 01:38:22,725
Speaker 7:  much right away, right? Like it just happens every day. Like

1612
01:38:22,725 --> 01:38:26,085
Speaker 7:  Yeah whoever's on tour right now, you see clips from the concert of that

1613
01:38:26,085 --> 01:38:27,485
Speaker 7:  night like in real time every day

1614
01:38:29,155 --> 01:38:33,085
Speaker 7:  Threads is so divorced in time. Yes. Right. It like

1615
01:38:33,255 --> 01:38:36,765
Speaker 7:  never feels relevant. So even you get the big algorithmic juice,

1616
01:38:37,175 --> 01:38:41,085
Speaker 7:  which is what everyone wants to copy from TikTok, but you lose

1617
01:38:41,185 --> 01:38:44,845
Speaker 7:  all of the relevance and then Blue Sky is just a fire hose of nonstop

1618
01:38:45,355 --> 01:38:48,965
Speaker 7:  apocalyptic relevance. Yeah. But at least it's funny, you know, like yeah

1619
01:38:49,645 --> 01:38:53,325
Speaker 7:  I don't think they've nailed that. 'cause once you lose the relevance then

1620
01:38:53,345 --> 01:38:57,205
Speaker 7:  you're like Twitter like becomes meaningless.

1621
01:38:57,345 --> 01:39:00,365
Speaker 7:  So you can have everybody there, but it's like, what's the point? And in

1622
01:39:00,365 --> 01:39:04,325
Speaker 7:  particular the thing that they, I think they've utterly biffed on is sports.

1623
01:39:05,355 --> 01:39:07,475
Speaker 7:  'cause if you don't want politics right? They keep saying they don't want

1624
01:39:07,475 --> 01:39:11,185
Speaker 7:  politics, they want to pol it's like dude, just like build great,

1625
01:39:11,295 --> 01:39:14,825
Speaker 7:  like hire every sports beat writer in America

1626
01:39:15,085 --> 01:39:18,705
Speaker 7:  and pay Adam Shefter to put the trades there first. Right.

1627
01:39:19,055 --> 01:39:22,865
Speaker 8:  Well the the problem is sports might

1628
01:39:22,935 --> 01:39:26,585
Speaker 8:  move faster on the like new to irrelevant timeline than

1629
01:39:26,945 --> 01:39:30,745
Speaker 8:  anything else. Yeah. Because like play by play and signing by set,

1630
01:39:30,745 --> 01:39:34,705
Speaker 8:  like all that stuff happens so fast and It is, it ceases to be timely and

1631
01:39:34,725 --> 01:39:38,665
Speaker 8:  new seconds after it happens. And so I think

1632
01:39:39,405 --> 01:39:43,105
Speaker 8:  for threads to try and be more like Instagram where they're a little more

1633
01:39:43,105 --> 01:39:46,425
Speaker 8:  timeless and they can show you older stuff that is still interesting doesn't

1634
01:39:46,425 --> 01:39:50,145
Speaker 8:  work with any of that stuff. And like what, what I think Threads is slowly

1635
01:39:50,425 --> 01:39:54,305
Speaker 8:  learning that Blue Sky learned really fast is that there is no middle

1636
01:39:54,305 --> 01:39:57,825
Speaker 8:  ground between like Twitter and Instagram. You just have to do Twitter. Yeah.

1637
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:00,865
Speaker 8:  Like you can't do Twitter on an Instagram

1638
01:40:01,615 --> 01:40:05,465
Speaker 8:  pace. Like you, the only way to do It is at Twitter pace and Blue Sky

1639
01:40:05,465 --> 01:40:07,705
Speaker 8:  figured that out really fast. And I think to its benefit,

1640
01:40:08,255 --> 01:40:12,185
Speaker 7:  It's it do you post to both every now and again I post to both in my experiences

1641
01:40:13,095 --> 01:40:14,155
Speaker 7:  you just see that

1642
01:40:15,755 --> 01:40:19,395
Speaker 7:  anything on threads just lives a life free of constraints.

1643
01:40:19,675 --> 01:40:23,395
Speaker 7:  It's so free. Like random people find it, they get mad at you

1644
01:40:23,655 --> 01:40:27,475
Speaker 7:  for reasons that are impossible to understand. 'cause they're seeing your

1645
01:40:27,475 --> 01:40:31,155
Speaker 7:  posts like six months after it happened. Blue Sky is a very tight

1646
01:40:31,155 --> 01:40:34,035
Speaker 7:  constrained amount of anger and then it, it dips, right?

1647
01:40:34,035 --> 01:40:36,435
Speaker 8:  Everybody gets mad at you for 10 minutes and minutes outta their feet.

1648
01:40:36,785 --> 01:40:40,555
Speaker 7:  Like a threats post that goes is like three weeks of just Randos being like,

1649
01:40:41,555 --> 01:40:44,595
Speaker 7:  I bought a Mac five years ago and it's like, I don't remember what we were

1650
01:40:44,595 --> 01:40:48,155
Speaker 7:  talking about at all. Yeah. Speaking of Activity, pub

1651
01:40:48,925 --> 01:40:52,675
Speaker 7:  Ghost, the so Open source rival the Substack newsletter

1652
01:40:52,915 --> 01:40:56,845
Speaker 7:  platform, they have completed the first switch of their

1653
01:40:57,085 --> 01:41:00,165
Speaker 7:  activity pub integration. It's, I think it's still in beta. You have to go

1654
01:41:00,165 --> 01:41:03,925
Speaker 7:  enable it. But they, so now you can ghost newsletters can go out over activity

1655
01:41:03,945 --> 01:41:07,645
Speaker 7:  pub to platforms like Pixel Fed to threads to MAs on. And then

1656
01:41:07,645 --> 01:41:11,445
Speaker 7:  importantly if you're a ghost person, you can feed all those things

1657
01:41:11,445 --> 01:41:15,285
Speaker 7:  back into Ghost. This is the one, you know, it's,

1658
01:41:15,325 --> 01:41:17,565
Speaker 7:  I don't think it's gonna set the world on fire, but especially 'cause it's

1659
01:41:17,565 --> 01:41:21,385
Speaker 7:  just in beta it's very small, but the part where the content comes back in

1660
01:41:21,645 --> 01:41:25,585
Speaker 7:  and if you're a ghost newsletter writer, you can look at Mastodon

1661
01:41:25,645 --> 01:41:28,985
Speaker 7:  and then like republish that and get engagement.

1662
01:41:29,405 --> 01:41:33,385
Speaker 7:  That's the part that I'm dying to see happen. 'cause that's the promise of

1663
01:41:33,385 --> 01:41:36,265
Speaker 7:  all these services and none of them it's come true nowhere yet.

1664
01:41:36,555 --> 01:41:40,425
Speaker 8:  Right. And that's also like, this is, if you wanna understand what

1665
01:41:40,425 --> 01:41:43,785
Speaker 8:  makes the Fedi verse interesting, it's this stuff, right? Because it's not

1666
01:41:44,525 --> 01:41:48,505
Speaker 8:  my Twitter clone can talk to your Twitter clone is one thing that's fine

1667
01:41:48,525 --> 01:41:52,105
Speaker 8:  and that's exciting and that's part of the solution here. But this is,

1668
01:41:52,465 --> 01:41:56,265
Speaker 8:  I can publish a newsletter that goes to my website, your email

1669
01:41:56,355 --> 01:41:59,825
Speaker 8:  inbox and their Mastodon feed. And if they respond to my email

1670
01:42:00,205 --> 01:42:03,385
Speaker 8:  or like on their mastodon or comment on my blog,

1671
01:42:04,175 --> 01:42:07,865
Speaker 8:  that actually all ends up as one conversation. And like

1672
01:42:07,895 --> 01:42:10,905
Speaker 8:  that is the thing that is hard to wrap your head around, but is ultimately

1673
01:42:10,935 --> 01:42:14,865
Speaker 8:  what makes this stuff work. Yeah. Is, is that it's

1674
01:42:14,865 --> 01:42:18,785
Speaker 8:  just stuff and it, you write where you want and I read where I

1675
01:42:18,785 --> 01:42:21,745
Speaker 8:  want and we both talk to each other in different places, but have the same

1676
01:42:21,745 --> 01:42:24,185
Speaker 8:  conversation. It's like, that's the magic of it.

1677
01:42:24,535 --> 01:42:28,385
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I can, It is concretely, you know, we talked about that starlink

1678
01:42:28,385 --> 01:42:31,585
Speaker 7:  and the White House story that was on Reddit. It got

1679
01:42:31,865 --> 01:42:35,745
Speaker 7:  hundreds if not a thousand comments. It it just did big numbers over

1680
01:42:35,745 --> 01:42:39,705
Speaker 7:  there. And the people on our site never saw that, that that whole set of

1681
01:42:39,705 --> 01:42:42,745
Speaker 7:  engagement had happened. Right. And if I could just connect those communities,

1682
01:42:43,235 --> 01:42:46,505
Speaker 7:  maybe not directly. 'cause I think there's value to having distinction between

1683
01:42:46,505 --> 01:42:50,305
Speaker 7:  communities, but if I could just let you see, like there's a huge conversation

1684
01:42:50,305 --> 01:42:53,665
Speaker 7:  about this story happening somewhere else and that's built into the piping

1685
01:42:53,665 --> 01:42:57,305
Speaker 7:  of the internet, then I, we all kind of get more value out of all of it.

1686
01:42:57,305 --> 01:43:00,345
Speaker 7:  Yeah. As opposed to being like, we basically just like gave Reddit a thing

1687
01:43:00,345 --> 01:43:04,145
Speaker 7:  to generate free content about like, if we can all pull that together,

1688
01:43:04,145 --> 01:43:06,985
Speaker 7:  there's something strong there. So I'm happy if the ghost has done this,

1689
01:43:07,085 --> 01:43:10,985
Speaker 7:  I'm watching it. I do think there's a protocol fight between Activity Pub

1690
01:43:11,045 --> 01:43:14,865
Speaker 7:  and at Protocol, which is what Blue Sky runs on. But like that's pretty fun.

1691
01:43:15,225 --> 01:43:19,145
Speaker 7:  I agree. Green shoots of innovation. Okay. Last one. I just

1692
01:43:19,145 --> 01:43:22,705
Speaker 7:  wanna, I wanna read you this quote head Sandos, the co CEO of Netflix.

1693
01:43:23,005 --> 01:43:26,865
Speaker 7:  The, the, the content. CEO gave the interview

1694
01:43:26,865 --> 01:43:30,665
Speaker 7:  to Variety and then they asked him about Apple TV and here's what he said

1695
01:43:30,665 --> 01:43:34,425
Speaker 7:  about Apple TV plus, I don't understand it beyond a marketing ploy, but they're

1696
01:43:34,425 --> 01:43:36,785
Speaker 7:  really smart people. Maybe they see something we don't,

1697
01:43:38,485 --> 01:43:39,865
Speaker 7:  that's a pretty good dunk.

1698
01:43:40,225 --> 01:43:43,985
Speaker 8:  I love this so much. He dunked on everybody in this one interview.

1699
01:43:44,185 --> 01:43:47,825
Speaker 8:  He like came at David lov and

1700
01:43:47,825 --> 01:43:51,325
Speaker 8:  Warner Brothers of Discovery for going with the Max name instead of the HBO

1701
01:43:51,325 --> 01:43:54,605
Speaker 8:  name. He dunked on Amazon. He was like, they're good at football, but I don't

1702
01:43:54,605 --> 01:43:58,485
Speaker 8:  what else are they doing? But I agree this was, this was the best one that

1703
01:43:58,485 --> 01:44:01,045
Speaker 8:  he's basically like, I don't know. They can, they can throw some money at

1704
01:44:01,045 --> 01:44:04,725
Speaker 8:  this if they want to. Did you see also the information had a story

1705
01:44:05,325 --> 01:44:09,085
Speaker 8:  I think today that said Apple's streaming is losing

1706
01:44:09,805 --> 01:44:11,165
Speaker 8:  over a billion dollars a year.

1707
01:44:12,875 --> 01:44:16,805
Speaker 8:  That It, is it, it it like maybe Ted Sarandos is right, like

1708
01:44:16,815 --> 01:44:20,685
Speaker 8:  maybe this is just Apple wanting to

1709
01:44:20,875 --> 01:44:24,845
Speaker 8:  have an in with people and be able to bring Oprah Winfrey up on

1710
01:44:24,845 --> 01:44:27,445
Speaker 8:  stage at events to talk about a billion pockets. And

1711
01:44:29,325 --> 01:44:32,895
Speaker 8:  I, I do think there is more to it than just that, but

1712
01:44:33,675 --> 01:44:37,615
Speaker 8:  It is, It is not obvious what Apple is in this for at

1713
01:44:37,615 --> 01:44:40,135
Speaker 7:  Particular moment. Wait, you don't, don't think it's obvious. I think it's

1714
01:44:40,135 --> 01:44:40,895
Speaker 7:  totally obvious. I

1715
01:44:40,895 --> 01:44:43,615
Speaker 8:  Think I, I can Galaxy brain my way into a theory,

1716
01:44:44,875 --> 01:44:48,595
Speaker 8:  but it, It is clearly not just

1717
01:44:48,595 --> 01:44:50,915
Speaker 8:  trying to build a competitive streaming service. Like No, it's,

1718
01:44:50,985 --> 01:44:51,635
Speaker 7:  It's definitely not that.

1719
01:44:51,745 --> 01:44:53,875
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So, okay. What do you think It is? You think it's obvious?

1720
01:44:54,355 --> 01:44:56,915
Speaker 7:  I think it's, I think it's obvious. I think Apple's money doesn't come from

1721
01:44:56,915 --> 01:45:00,355
Speaker 7:  the iPhone anymore, right. iPhone sales are declining, max sales are growing,

1722
01:45:00,415 --> 01:45:04,305
Speaker 7:  but like, it's not enough. Apple's money comes

1723
01:45:04,375 --> 01:45:05,905
Speaker 7:  from Candy Crush Whales.

1724
01:45:06,735 --> 01:45:07,465
Speaker 8:  Sure. Yeah. Like

1725
01:45:07,585 --> 01:45:10,865
Speaker 7:  Meaningfully, that's the money. It comes from the base

1726
01:45:11,455 --> 01:45:14,425
Speaker 7:  tier of iCloud being way too small and everyone having to pay for more storage.

1727
01:45:14,955 --> 01:45:18,785
Speaker 7:  Right. And then they upsell you into services. But like it's in-app

1728
01:45:18,945 --> 01:45:22,065
Speaker 7:  purchases, it's the, it's the app store tax, right? It's 30% on Candy Crush

1729
01:45:22,065 --> 01:45:25,905
Speaker 7:  whales. That is the bulk of Apple's revenue now. It's the thing that's

1730
01:45:25,905 --> 01:45:29,745
Speaker 7:  growing every year. It's growing and you cannot be like, okay,

1731
01:45:30,635 --> 01:45:33,785
Speaker 7:  we're the richest company in the world. We're the most innovative company

1732
01:45:33,785 --> 01:45:36,845
Speaker 7:  in the world. The money is from Candy Crush Whale.

1733
01:45:38,475 --> 01:45:42,445
Speaker 7:  They can't, they, they have to put a, a better face on

1734
01:45:42,845 --> 01:45:43,005
Speaker 7:  services.

1735
01:45:43,925 --> 01:45:44,165
Speaker 8:  Interesting.

1736
01:45:44,425 --> 01:45:48,365
Speaker 7:  And so you get severance and you're like, we're the company that makes severance.

1737
01:45:48,585 --> 01:45:52,405
Speaker 7:  That's a service. Don't you love Apple TV plus the service, we're a services

1738
01:45:52,405 --> 01:45:55,765
Speaker 7:  company and then hidden under that

1739
01:45:56,305 --> 01:45:57,445
Speaker 7:  are some Candy Crush wheels.

1740
01:45:58,065 --> 01:46:01,685
Speaker 8:  So it's the, it's the sexy lost leader in the bundle

1741
01:46:02,155 --> 01:46:06,085
Speaker 8:  that like, makes the bundle seem cooler than just payment processing

1742
01:46:06,085 --> 01:46:07,005
Speaker 8:  and Candy Crush whales.

1743
01:46:07,315 --> 01:46:11,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Because I think if they're that company then they, they lose

1744
01:46:11,375 --> 01:46:15,325
Speaker 7:  their, their like sense of self. Right, right. Like what

1745
01:46:15,325 --> 01:46:19,165
Speaker 7:  we are is Stripe, but we have a gun. You know, like

1746
01:46:19,165 --> 01:46:23,005
Speaker 7:  and the gun is your app doesn't exist anymore. Right? Yeah. I don't,

1747
01:46:23,025 --> 01:46:25,125
Speaker 7:  that's not Apple. I think they're we're That's interesting. We're the creative

1748
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:28,885
Speaker 7:  company and we make the Mac Pro. And don't you, this video music

1749
01:46:28,885 --> 01:46:32,645
Speaker 7:  video was shot on an iPhone. Like they're that company. I think they have

1750
01:46:32,645 --> 01:46:35,325
Speaker 7:  a lot of consternation about how much money all this is losing. Yes.

1751
01:46:37,065 --> 01:46:40,725
Speaker 7:  But I think at the end of the day, all of it exists to,

1752
01:46:40,985 --> 01:46:43,805
Speaker 7:  to make them the art company, not the billing company.

1753
01:46:44,465 --> 01:46:48,445
Speaker 8:  That's a good take. And It is, I think would, would Apple spend

1754
01:46:48,685 --> 01:46:52,445
Speaker 8:  a billion dollars a year on maintaining its identity

1755
01:46:52,625 --> 01:46:56,485
Speaker 8:  as a company that does and loves creative stuff? Absolutely. No

1756
01:46:56,725 --> 01:47:00,205
Speaker 8:  question. Yeah. Which is why like there was all this talk when Severance

1757
01:47:00,205 --> 01:47:03,165
Speaker 8:  season two was coming out about how, you know, super delayed and super over

1758
01:47:03,165 --> 01:47:06,605
Speaker 8:  budget. And now It is, It is probably the

1759
01:47:07,275 --> 01:47:10,045
Speaker 8:  busiest show out right now. I would say

1760
01:47:11,705 --> 01:47:13,605
Speaker 8:  you hate it, but you're, what do you know, I'm

1761
01:47:14,605 --> 01:47:18,445
Speaker 7:  I, I watched this show religiously. I think It is beautiful. It is

1762
01:47:18,595 --> 01:47:22,365
Speaker 7:  beautifully made. I'm just saying we have

1763
01:47:22,785 --> 01:47:26,685
Speaker 7:  landed in a time when there are so few beautifully

1764
01:47:26,965 --> 01:47:30,725
Speaker 7:  well-crafted things to watch that we have to

1765
01:47:30,725 --> 01:47:32,765
Speaker 7:  pretend that this is the best one that's ever been. Sure. But

1766
01:47:32,785 --> 01:47:36,725
Speaker 8:  But I, this is all ancillary to my point, which is I think your argument

1767
01:47:36,725 --> 01:47:40,485
Speaker 8:  would suggest that the brand value of how much people

1768
01:47:40,485 --> 01:47:44,325
Speaker 8:  loved Ted Lasso and how invested people are in severance

1769
01:47:45,305 --> 01:47:49,255
Speaker 8:  makes the rest of the thing irrelevant. That like, it's not quite

1770
01:47:49,255 --> 01:47:52,935
Speaker 8:  marketing, but it, It is like, it's, it's like a love engine for Apple that

1771
01:47:52,935 --> 01:47:54,615
Speaker 8:  kind of doesn't exist anywhere else right now.

1772
01:47:54,965 --> 01:47:58,695
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And again, they get to show up on their earnings calls and say,

1773
01:47:58,845 --> 01:48:02,655
Speaker 7:  once again, services led the quarter with our award-winning

1774
01:48:02,655 --> 01:48:05,855
Speaker 7:  show Ted Lasso. Right. Not with our Candy Crush whale,

1775
01:48:06,205 --> 01:48:10,015
Speaker 7:  extremely ruthless collection of taxes from Candy Crush Whales.

1776
01:48:10,115 --> 01:48:13,695
Speaker 8:  We extracted more value from all of our app developers.

1777
01:48:13,695 --> 01:48:17,335
Speaker 7:  Every developer in the world is pissed at us. Yeah. Because our people call

1778
01:48:17,335 --> 01:48:20,215
Speaker 7:  them up and demand that we add in-app purchases to their apps

1779
01:48:21,635 --> 01:48:25,535
Speaker 7:  and that's our money. Like you, have you heard about Ted Lasso? He's so

1780
01:48:25,535 --> 01:48:25,935
Speaker 7:  cheerful.

1781
01:48:26,355 --> 01:48:28,135
Speaker 8:  No, I I I buy that. That's a good theory.

1782
01:48:29,035 --> 01:48:32,455
Speaker 7:  And I I I do think they'll reconcile costs along the way. 'cause

1783
01:48:33,195 --> 01:48:35,995
Speaker 7:  I mean, what am I pointing out? There's less competition for beautifully

1784
01:48:35,995 --> 01:48:39,955
Speaker 7:  made shows. So I they will find a way to bring things.

1785
01:48:40,135 --> 01:48:43,355
Speaker 7:  You can see it. What's that movie they just made The Gorge

1786
01:48:44,885 --> 01:48:48,715
Speaker 7:  don't do that. They're, they're bad at that. Like they should stop

1787
01:48:48,955 --> 01:48:52,755
Speaker 7:  spending that money. I think have they made a movie that's like, like Good

1788
01:48:53,305 --> 01:48:54,155
Speaker 8:  Coda won Best Picture

1789
01:48:54,935 --> 01:48:56,755
Speaker 7:  But they didn't they bought that movie. True.

1790
01:48:58,735 --> 01:49:02,595
Speaker 8:  No, I of the like big Apple originals F1

1791
01:49:02,655 --> 01:49:06,595
Speaker 8:  is the Big swing coming this summer. That's gonna be

1792
01:49:06,595 --> 01:49:10,275
Speaker 8:  the one I would guess it's either going to be a big monster

1793
01:49:10,455 --> 01:49:13,235
Speaker 8:  hit or It is going to make a lot of heads roll inside of Apple

1794
01:49:14,065 --> 01:49:17,235
Speaker 8:  because that is, I think by, by some accounts like one of the most expensive

1795
01:49:17,235 --> 01:49:21,155
Speaker 8:  movies of all time, they've been talking about it forever. It is, it's it's

1796
01:49:21,155 --> 01:49:25,115
Speaker 8:  a huge deal for Apple. And if it doesn't hit, I think a lot of people

1797
01:49:25,135 --> 01:49:25,555
Speaker 8:  get fired.

1798
01:49:26,645 --> 01:49:28,175
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I watched the trailer.

1799
01:49:29,705 --> 01:49:30,485
Speaker 7:  It it,

1800
01:49:30,795 --> 01:49:31,805
Speaker 8:  It's not a very good trailer.

1801
01:49:32,145 --> 01:49:35,285
Speaker 7:  It, it doesn't seem like it has a lot to do with one.

1802
01:49:36,025 --> 01:49:39,725
Speaker 8:  No, it's just Brad Pitt like being beautiful. Yeah. And he's very good at

1803
01:49:39,725 --> 01:49:39,805
Speaker 8:  that.

1804
01:49:40,155 --> 01:49:42,645
Speaker 7:  That said like even at this point Drive to Survive doesn't have a lot to

1805
01:49:42,645 --> 01:49:46,565
Speaker 7:  do with F1. No. Like I, what I think was Toto Wolf was like,

1806
01:49:46,565 --> 01:49:50,445
Speaker 7:  this show is basically Top Gun. And I was like, yeah. Rules. So

1807
01:49:50,445 --> 01:49:53,805
Speaker 7:  that's fine. Yeah. Got right. Yeah. Anyhow,

1808
01:49:55,275 --> 01:49:58,925
Speaker 7:  they'll reconcile their costs. But you can see, I think Ted

1809
01:49:58,965 --> 01:50:01,965
Speaker 7:  Sarandos knows that Apple has this to dress up its services line and he's,

1810
01:50:01,965 --> 01:50:03,165
Speaker 7:  I think he's willing to take that dunk.

1811
01:50:03,595 --> 01:50:07,325
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And I don't think, I don't think Netflix feels pressure

1812
01:50:07,325 --> 01:50:10,405
Speaker 8:  from any of the companies. Ted Sarandos named here. Like yeah,

1813
01:50:10,875 --> 01:50:13,525
Speaker 7:  He's not worried about that. There was that one moment where they accidentally

1814
01:50:13,525 --> 01:50:16,285
Speaker 7:  lit up universal search on the Apple TV and everyone thought they caved and

1815
01:50:16,285 --> 01:50:18,885
Speaker 7:  they're like, Nope, no, we, we, we mis set a feature flag.

1816
01:50:19,755 --> 01:50:22,685
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I kind of like they did that on purpose just as a flex. They're like,

1817
01:50:22,685 --> 01:50:24,485
Speaker 8:  wouldn't it be cool if we did this too bad?

1818
01:50:24,755 --> 01:50:28,645
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Alright. We're way over like way, way, way, way over. Thanks again
