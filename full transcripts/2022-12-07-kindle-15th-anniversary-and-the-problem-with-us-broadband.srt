00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,720
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Vercast, the flagship podcast of mounting TV's

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,480
Speaker 2:  way too high in hospital rooms. I'm your friend David Pierce, and I just

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,960
Speaker 2:  had a baby. As you're hearing this, he's about five days old. Everybody's

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,600
Speaker 2:  doing well. He has really strong opinions about PS4 and Xbox

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,800
Speaker 2:  and iOS and Android and which streaming service is the best, and you're gonna

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,560
Speaker 2:  hear from him a lot on this show at some point. I suspect thank you to everybody

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,440
Speaker 2:  who heard on the Friday show and sent me nice emails and tweets. I really

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,400
Speaker 2:  appreciate it. He is also the reason, this is one of the last episodes you're

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,320
Speaker 2:  gonna hear me on for a while. You're in such good hands with Liam and

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,240
Speaker 2:  Andrew and Eli and Alex and the whole Verge cast crew, but I'm gonna be gone

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,680
Speaker 2:  for a few months. I will miss you all terribly. In the meantime, we have

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,000
Speaker 2:  an awesome show for you today. We're gonna talk a lot about ebook readers

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,560
Speaker 2:  and Kindles because this is not only right around the 15th anniversary of

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,480
Speaker 2:  the Kindle, it's also the time that the Kindle scribe, which you

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,880
Speaker 2:  could argue is Amazon's most ambitious Kindle ever is coming out. So we're

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,720
Speaker 2:  gonna dig into what all of that means and whether the ebook market is

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,240
Speaker 2:  headed in the right direction. We're also gonna talk about a big study we

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,080
Speaker 2:  did with some partners where we got 22,000 people's internet bills and

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,520
Speaker 2:  tried to figure out what do you get when you pay for your internet? Are you

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,680
Speaker 2:  paying the right amount? Are you getting the right speeds? It's all a little

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,280
Speaker 2:  bleak and very interesting. All of that is coming up in just a second, but

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
Speaker 2:  it's just about checkout time for me. So I gotta go figure out how car seats

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,200
Speaker 2:  work and then try to steal everything from the hospital. This is the Vergecast.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,000
Speaker 2:  We'll see you in a sec.

26
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,490
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So last year in partnership with Consumer Reports,

27
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,330
Speaker 2:  the Verge asked readers to share their internet bills. Basically

28
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,730
Speaker 2:  we wanted to find out how Americans are getting online and what it costs.

29
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,770
Speaker 2:  We ended up getting more than 22,000 bills submitted to us.

30
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,730
Speaker 2:  The Consumer Reports data team then spent over a year pouring through

31
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,090
Speaker 2:  all of that data and all of those bills because bills are messy and complicated.

32
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,050
Speaker 2:  And together we've assembled a kind of snapshot of how

33
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,120
Speaker 2:  much people are paying for internet access in the United States. Russell

34
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,080
Speaker 2:  Brandham worked on the verges end of that project and he's here to talk about

35
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,320
Speaker 2:  the findings. But before we get into it, I just wanna reiterate something.

36
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,680
Speaker 2:  You're about to hear us both say a bunch. This is not like

37
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,360
Speaker 2:  a scientific paper with peer review and a perfect study of

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,280
Speaker 2:  us broadband that's basically impossible to do for a

39
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,400
Speaker 2:  bunch of frustrating and important reasons you'll hear about as we talk here.

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,520
Speaker 2:  But this is still a big study and we learned a lot. So we're gonna get into

41
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,920
Speaker 2:  it anyway, let's go.

42
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,160
Speaker 2:  Hi Russell. Hi. Let's just start at the very beginning. So what was the idea

43
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,560
Speaker 2:  behind this big survey that we and Consumer

44
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,400
Speaker 2:  Reports and others did on people's I S P

45
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,880
Speaker 2:  cable bills? Yeah,

46
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,400
Speaker 6:  So there is not a lot of information

47
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,600
Speaker 6:  about the sort of state of broadband. And then to the

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,440
Speaker 6:  extent that there is, it tends to be about like coverage. Like is there

49
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,080
Speaker 6:  an accessible broadband connection in this county

50
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,240
Speaker 6:  in Nebraska or wherever the, a lot of the FCC data is

51
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,200
Speaker 6:  self-reported by ISPs and they kind of exaggerate. And so people have a

52
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,000
Speaker 6:  problem with that and I think a lot of people anecdotally probably

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,640
Speaker 6:  know about this that just the process of paying for the is

54
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,680
Speaker 6:  P like just paying for access varies a lot from service

55
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,480
Speaker 6:  to service and sometimes is a little like scammy and

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,720
Speaker 6:  weird,

57
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,040
Speaker 2:  Right? Sometimes it's also a lot scammy and weird. Yeah,

58
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,600
Speaker 6:  Data caps are the big one and we didn't quite get as much

59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,320
Speaker 6:  information on that as we wanted from this, but we got

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,280
Speaker 6:  sort of general prices and we got a lot of information

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,160
Speaker 6:  about fees which like there are just a lot of fees

62
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,880
Speaker 6:  that are made up basically.

63
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Speaker 2:  Right? Yeah. Okay. So I wanna get into all that but, so basically, what was

64
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,680
Speaker 2:  it, 22,000 people sent us their cable bill.

65
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,880
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And that wasn't just us, that's consumer reports too. But we put a

66
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,320
Speaker 6:  big thing on the Verge and they put a big thing on consumer reports.com

67
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,320
Speaker 6:  saying like basically send us your, your internet bills. You know, there

68
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,560
Speaker 6:  was a whole secure system for getting them because there's a lot of private

69
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,440
Speaker 6:  information on there. And then also, you know, once they were in the

70
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,840
Speaker 6:  bucket there was a lot of like, we're gonna make sure that this isn't

71
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,120
Speaker 6:  accessible to just random Joe who works at Consumer Reports.

72
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,160
Speaker 6:  And so the process of getting the data from that many bills was

73
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,800
Speaker 6:  a whole elaborate thing that I did basically none of, so

74
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,040
Speaker 2:  I,

75
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,640
Speaker 6:  I always wanna give credit to the people who actually put in the legwork.

76
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,360
Speaker 2:  Okay. And so the, the hedge before we get into what we learned is basically

77
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,160
Speaker 2:  this is not a representative sample of Americans cable

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,560
Speaker 2:  bills because like you were saying, that essentially doesn't exist. Right?

79
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,360
Speaker 2:  And I think that's actually like important context behind all of this is

80
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,360
Speaker 2:  we talk a lot about US broadband and access and

81
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,160
Speaker 2:  prices, but the honest truth is we don't know The data sucks. Yeah. The data

82
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,560
Speaker 2:  that exists, like you said, is mostly self-reported. All of it is imperfect.

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,240
Speaker 2:  And I just think about it as like the best thing we have is like those maps

84
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,160
Speaker 2:  that T-Mobile puts in commercials where that's just like 98% of America is

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,760
Speaker 2:  pink and it's like I like I don't know what to do with that information as

86
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,160
Speaker 2:  far as I can tell on any of this. We don't have literally basically no more

87
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,840
Speaker 2:  granular information than that.

88
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,800
Speaker 6:  Yeah, absolutely. And I mean I think of it in some ways in terms of

89
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,720
Speaker 6:  like what phones should I buy? What TV should I buy? We

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,680
Speaker 6:  actually have pretty good information about like what

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,880
Speaker 6:  does this particular TV cost, what is a reasonable amount

92
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,560
Speaker 6:  to pay for a 36 inch TV this

93
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,240
Speaker 6:  year? Like we actually know that pretty well and if someone

94
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,120
Speaker 6:  comes along trying to charge another one, they have to put it up publicly

95
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,840
Speaker 6:  and we will be out there saying that TV is too expensive. Right? Right.

96
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,200
Speaker 6:  And it's just very hard to do a similar thing for internet

97
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,320
Speaker 6:  because we're so deep in the weeds of like

98
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,120
Speaker 6:  you just move in to your home or wherever

99
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,400
Speaker 6:  and it's, well who do I pay for internet? It's

100
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,280
Speaker 6:  this guy he's your only options for, for many, many,

101
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,200
Speaker 6:  many people. Yeah.

102
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,000
Speaker 2:  Again, not representative sample but big sample. So we learned a lot of

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Speaker 2:  useful information here. Let's start with price cuz I feel like that is kind

104
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,960
Speaker 2:  of the big question you should sort of explain how you look at the data cuz

105
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,160
Speaker 2:  you spent a lot more time with it, but to me the range seemed to go from

106
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,000
Speaker 2:  like slightly more expensive than it seems like it should be to massively

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,840
Speaker 2:  more expensive than it seems like it should be. That seems like the range

108
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,600
Speaker 2:  Americans live in.

109
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,480
Speaker 6:  Yeah, the sort of middle of our sample was

110
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,080
Speaker 6:  around $75, which I think as someone

111
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,720
Speaker 6:  who has lived many years buying us internet access

112
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,760
Speaker 6:  sort of sounds about right to me. I'm like okay, like that,

113
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,600
Speaker 6:  that's about as much as a person place that is much more than you would pay

114
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,320
Speaker 6:  in many parts of Europe. So this is a different survey, but there's this

115
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Speaker 6:  survey that the Open Technology Institute did that we linked to in the piece

116
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,360
Speaker 6:  that looks at different places all around the world. Extremely expensive

117
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,240
Speaker 6:  in Hong Kong. Interestingly, I don't know why that is, it seems

118
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,160
Speaker 6:  like a densely populated island, so it can't be that expensive to live fiber,

119
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,960
Speaker 6:  but maybe interconnection is weird. Also

120
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Speaker 2:  Everything's expensive in Hong Kong. I went there once and it was like the

121
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,640
Speaker 2:  most expensive vacation I've ever been on in my life. So it might just might

122
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,760
Speaker 2:  have something to do with that. Yeah.

123
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,320
Speaker 6:  But like large parts of Western Europe are much, much lower. And

124
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,160
Speaker 6:  so Paris, London, you're talking 30 or 40 bucks a month. So

125
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,360
Speaker 6:  I mean I think that is the basic thing of just like our

126
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,200
Speaker 6:  expectations are to pay a lot for broadband. I

127
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,120
Speaker 6:  was expecting, I mean I, I looked in the data thinking,

128
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,320
Speaker 6:  is there some class of people who are just paying 150 bucks a month

129
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,320
Speaker 6:  And that didn't really show up. It is true that there are like

130
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,880
Speaker 6:  six bills out of the 22,000 where people are paying more

131
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,840
Speaker 6:  than $200. Wow. Which seems obscene but also it's six

132
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,720
Speaker 6:  out of 22,000. Right. So like the high ends very

133
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,480
Speaker 6:  high. I maybe would be willing to believe that those people are, have

134
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,040
Speaker 6:  special circumstances or like are using some obscene amount of data or

135
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,080
Speaker 6:  they're just constantly sort of streaming in 4K

136
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,880
Speaker 6:  because they run a in-demand YouTube channel and it's just

137
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,640
Speaker 6:  extremely, I mean I don't, I don't know. Yeah. Do we have a lot of

138
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,560
Speaker 6:  YouTubers in the V Verge audience and they're eager to send their internet

139
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,280
Speaker 6:  bills. So true that, but yeah, I was not shocked by the high end.

140
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,600
Speaker 6:  I will say I, it was hard to look at it in a way where it's like actually

141
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,240
Speaker 6:  a, a significant number of people are paying like really

142
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,160
Speaker 6:  shocking amounts that didn't seem like it was happening.

143
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,000
Speaker 2:  Okay. And that's actually somewhat surprising now that I think about it because

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,320
Speaker 2:  a another thing that you guys dug into is basically how many choices people

145
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,080
Speaker 2:  have, right? And the, the thing we've railed on a lot on this show is that

146
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,000
Speaker 2:  most people don't get to choose their provider. You need broadband

147
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,920
Speaker 2:  internet. It's like th this is just sort of a a life critical thing now.

148
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,880
Speaker 2:  So it's actually to some extent surprising to me that some of these providers

149
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,120
Speaker 2:  are not out there being like, okay, well you don't have anywhere to go, we're

150
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,680
Speaker 2:  just gonna jack up the prices 40 bucks a month because what are you gonna

151
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:42,880
Speaker 2:  do?

152
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,760
Speaker 6:  Yeah, absolutely. I mean I also think one of the dynamics

153
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,600
Speaker 6:  that became clear, so we also did a survey of it, it was a little noisier

154
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,960
Speaker 6:  because like we were doing it by zip code and we're like what happens when

155
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,920
Speaker 6:  there's more than one provider in a zip code and the price does go down?

156
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,920
Speaker 6:  We're like, it's a statistically messy because of all the sample issues we've

157
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,440
Speaker 6:  been talking about. But you do sort of see the line going down and it makes

158
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,280
Speaker 6:  sense. The weird thing, so like you

159
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,200
Speaker 6:  need broadband but then what we're measuring is actually providers

160
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,840
Speaker 6:  and there's a lot of situations where there's a single

161
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,880
Speaker 6:  broadband provider but like Frontier DSL is out here

162
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,280
Speaker 6:  or you know whatever DSL provider and they're like, we can give you

163
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,240
Speaker 6:  something that will load a webpage. It's not like

164
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,880
Speaker 6:  really the modern internet speed. And again, I mean that's because

165
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,640
Speaker 6:  that's sort of, you don't have to run a whole fiber optic line over

166
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,320
Speaker 6:  to do it. Right. So I think that's a real pattern in like

167
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,480
Speaker 6:  US availability is that you'll have one good one and then a bunch

168
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,160
Speaker 6:  of crappy ones that are sort of bringing up the rear.

169
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,120
Speaker 2:  Got it. So and then maybe the bad ones, they don't keep the good ones fully

170
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,600
Speaker 2:  in check, but they're at least enough that it's like if my bill went from

171
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,480
Speaker 2:  $70 to $200, that's when you get a bunch of people who are gonna be like,

172
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,440
Speaker 2:  okay, I'll take, I'll take worse internet for a price I can actually afford.

173
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,160
Speaker 2:  So they maybe don't keep it all the way down but they keep it a little bit

174
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,400
Speaker 2:  in touch with reality.

175
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean this is a, a sort of big open question is how much

176
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,240
Speaker 6:  they're actually helping us like having the DSL option out there. And I

177
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,720
Speaker 6:  also think another thing that I worry about

178
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,880
Speaker 6:  is, you know the big picture anti-monopoly claim is

179
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,720
Speaker 6:  if you only have one option then they're sort of in a

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,840
Speaker 6:  position of power and like they can charge a lot but that's not

181
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,480
Speaker 6:  the only way they could use that power. So the other thing you might see

182
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,400
Speaker 6:  is just like worse service. Hmm. That that I S P

183
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,000
Speaker 6:  doesn't have reason to kind of invest in a

184
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,040
Speaker 6:  good technician to come by when a squirrel chews through your fiber optic

185
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,000
Speaker 6:  line and your internet drops because they sort of know that people

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,840
Speaker 6:  in that region are gonna be customers no matter what. And so Right.

187
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,560
Speaker 6:  They can just let that slide, we'd have to do another survey to find out

188
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,240
Speaker 6:  if that's true. True. But I think that is kind of another place for that

189
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,160
Speaker 6:  energy to go.

190
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,840
Speaker 2:  That makes sense. That also brings us to the fees, which I think is the piece

191
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,640
Speaker 2:  of this that actually to some extent surprised me the most because like we

192
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,240
Speaker 2:  pay too much for not very good internet is kind of like an

193
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,200
Speaker 2:  unproven but sort of truism of like anybody who pays attention to this industry.

194
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,800
Speaker 2:  But you went and found that basically we are in addition to all of that just

195
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,720
Speaker 2:  getting nickel and dimed to absolute death. Like what, what did you

196
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,240
Speaker 2:  guys discover?

197
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,200
Speaker 6:  So we gave him a pass on equipment fees. We didn't do that. But this is another

198
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,960
Speaker 6:  thing that Vercast listeners I'm sure know well is that ISPs love

199
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,720
Speaker 6:  nothing more than to rent you a bad router. Ugh.

200
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,080
Speaker 2:  They love

201
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,960
Speaker 6:  It sort of indefinitely. Yeah. And it's like you're paying $5 a

202
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,720
Speaker 6:  month every month for a $15 router and that

203
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,400
Speaker 6:  is in some sense like it's bad and I don't wanna say it's your

204
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,320
Speaker 6:  fault, but you can buy your own router and you probably should

205
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,040
Speaker 6:  and you will, they will stop charging you the rental fee for the router if

206
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,960
Speaker 6:  you buy your own router.

207
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,520
Speaker 2:  Not probably by the way you absolutely a hundred percent should. Like if

208
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,000
Speaker 2:  you are listening to this now and you are renting your router, stop it. Like

209
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,720
Speaker 2:  go buy a router, they're on Amazon, they're very inexpensive, super easy

210
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,400
Speaker 2:  to set up. They all pay for themselves like within a year just go do it

211
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,840
Speaker 2:  bro. I promise it's worth it.

212
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,600
Speaker 6:  So those aren't even represented on the chart. Yeah but it's worth talking

213
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,520
Speaker 6:  about because then so the next level is data

214
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,560
Speaker 6:  caps, which are just bad. Like again it's sort

215
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,400
Speaker 6:  of fair play because they're telling you upfront like this is the amount

216
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,280
Speaker 6:  of thing but it is just not the way internet service should

217
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,120
Speaker 6:  work. No it's not the way any actual things that you use on the internet

218
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,760
Speaker 6:  work. And so that is represented in here because just

219
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,720
Speaker 6:  the fact that people are paying huge amounts for that is sort of

220
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,680
Speaker 6:  a big part of what the story of internet fees is. And then

221
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,520
Speaker 6:  the third thing is they will just make something up that

222
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,400
Speaker 6:  is like internet infrastructure fee, right? DNS services

223
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,240
Speaker 6:  because DNS is famously, if you use more of it, we need to charge you

224
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,120
Speaker 6:  more. Like it's just, I mean one, there's no reasonable relationship to the

225
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,480
Speaker 6:  amount this cost and the amount they're charging you. They're just sort of

226
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,880
Speaker 6:  made up. They named a cost of their business and they were like this is a

227
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,440
Speaker 6:  fee for that. And then also this is not how anything you buy works the line

228
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,160
Speaker 6:  we use in the pieces that it's like you bought a sandwich and they're like,

229
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,640
Speaker 6:  well there's a 50 cent mustard fee. It's like okay.

230
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,600
Speaker 2:  And you're like I don't want mustard. And they're like, yeah it's the

231
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,560
Speaker 6:  Fee I guess I'm paying for mustard. Yeah, you might if there's mustard

232
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,400
Speaker 6:  on the sandwich, you might just include that in the price of the sandwich.

233
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,440
Speaker 2:  No, to me this is like, so I just bought a car a couple of weeks ago and

234
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,000
Speaker 2:  we were sitting there buying the car talking about all the prices and there's

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,440
Speaker 2:  a certain set of things right that it's like if I want the leather seats

236
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,640
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna pay more money for that. Like I get that. Yeah but we didn't want

237
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,360
Speaker 2:  the leather seats. And then so we go through the whole line and then we get

238
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,320
Speaker 2:  to the end and it just says $899 processing fee. And I was like,

239
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,040
Speaker 2:  I literally was like we're we're just sitting here filling out paperwork

240
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,400
Speaker 2:  like what is the $900 processing fee? Like if it was

241
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,880
Speaker 2:  $9 I would've been like, okay, it like costs you money to store papers somewhere

242
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,320
Speaker 2:  but like 900 do and the guy selling us the car literally goes, I don't know,

243
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,440
Speaker 2:  that's just what the manager decides. I was like what are we doing here?

244
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,160
Speaker 6:  You don't wanna skimp on the processing because then a year later

245
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,440
Speaker 6:  your processing valve's gonna go out and you're gonna be right back in the

246
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,040
Speaker 6:  shop. Yeah,

247
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,600
Speaker 2:  It's exactly right And there's just nothing you can do about it because again,

248
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,640
Speaker 2:  like I needed a car, the guy knew I needed a car just is what it is. Yeah.

249
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,040
Speaker 2:  He literally goes My mom paid the processing fee. I was like that's true.

250
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,960
Speaker 2:  But anyway, these to me are like the most monopolistic thing that came

251
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,720
Speaker 2:  up in this whole survey because this is just the nonsense you can get away

252
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,040
Speaker 2:  with when there's nobody out there to do better.

253
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,200
Speaker 6:  I will also say, and this is like not to defend

254
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,840
Speaker 6:  enormous telecoms but

255
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,800
Speaker 2:  Bold strategy friend, I

256
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,720
Speaker 6:  Know this is like really like and the ver Verge cast listeners are like what's

257
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,120
Speaker 6:  he gonna say? You see at and t on the logo

258
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,240
Speaker 6:  or Xfinity or any of these huge companies And a big

259
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,200
Speaker 6:  part of what has happened, like at and t probably didn't

260
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,120
Speaker 6:  lay the fiber. They are corporate conglomerates, right?

261
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,840
Speaker 6:  And their is P holdings are conglomerates of other

262
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,600
Speaker 6:  ISPs. So some of it they laid the fiber but some of it, it's like

263
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,720
Speaker 6:  we just bought this business that was a smaller I S P

264
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,760
Speaker 6:  and we are in the process of at and tifying it.

265
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,080
Speaker 6:  But like sometimes that's a long process and so it's a

266
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Speaker 6:  real patchwork. I'm not, I'm using at and t as example. Sure. Like they're

267
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,880
Speaker 6:  not especially like this but any big company you would think okay, there's

268
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,680
Speaker 6:  some basic standard of like the fees they're charging and the sort of service

269
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,400
Speaker 6:  setup and it's really a patchwork based on like

270
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,600
Speaker 6:  the legacy of what I S P used to

271
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,280
Speaker 6:  like how recently another I S P was operating

272
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,240
Speaker 6:  that network And like you have no

273
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,200
Speaker 6:  real way of knowing that. Which is also why like then they don't wanna

274
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,320
Speaker 6:  suddenly stop charging the fee and the ISP becomes unprofitable

275
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,600
Speaker 6:  but they committed to this thing. So like it's not that we could

276
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,120
Speaker 6:  find, this is why it was so important to sort of gather all of these bills

277
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,880
Speaker 6:  because the fees are really all over the place even within one company.

278
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,280
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Okay. So are there any good actors in

279
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,200
Speaker 2:  this space? Like is there anybody out there saying just because you know,

280
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,080
Speaker 2:  we either have to do right by people or we're in a position to,

281
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,080
Speaker 2:  or just because you know we're the rare good guy who gets into the I S P

282
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,960
Speaker 2:  space. Like is there anybody we found who it's like, you know, good job.

283
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,520
Speaker 2:  Random Midwestern, I S P,

284
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,800
Speaker 6:  This is my personal I S P.

285
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,160
Speaker 2:  Oh

286
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,440
Speaker 6:  Okay. And I would not say that my experiences have been

287
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,160
Speaker 6:  spotless.

288
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,680
Speaker 2:  If you're listening, please don't turn off Russell's internet.

289
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,480
Speaker 6:  But Optimum, we had more than 400 bills

290
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,640
Speaker 6:  and the average fee was less than $4. Hmm.

291
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,320
Speaker 6:  Which is like pretty good.

292
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,240
Speaker 2:  Whereas I think Xfinity, which is mine, was something like $31.

293
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,080
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And that's more than 250 at and t is was high. But

294
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,040
Speaker 6:  in fairness we have to say we don't have a lot of at and t bills. Sure. So

295
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,440
Speaker 6:  it's like it was 25 bucks but it's only 11 bills. So like maybe someone

296
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,280
Speaker 6:  ran into a lot of data charges and we just got a weird sample of it. The

297
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,920
Speaker 6:  other one I would say, and I don't know a ton about this, but spark light

298
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,120
Speaker 6:  was 300 bills 4 0 1 decent stuff.

299
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,600
Speaker 6:  I, the other one, and this is a whole section in the piece

300
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,720
Speaker 6:  is satellite internet, the fees get really high cuz you have to buy a dish.

301
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,280
Speaker 6:  Sure. I mean that's the equipment fees. But then there's also like, I think

302
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,360
Speaker 6:  HughesNet is one of the big satellite operators and they have a, a lot

303
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,160
Speaker 6:  of like, again I would have to look into the HughesNet offerings, but the

304
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,080
Speaker 6:  average fee for the 20 HughesNet bills we have are like, it's like 70 bucks.

305
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,760
Speaker 6:  So, and I imagine that that has to do with the cost of operating

306
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,480
Speaker 6:  satellites and just like delivering intranet that way that like some of that

307
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,000
Speaker 6:  just gets rolled into the fees.

308
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,320
Speaker 2:  I'm glad you brought up the satellite actually because that is one of the

309
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,080
Speaker 2:  things that the people in this space see as like a potential equalizer,

310
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,680
Speaker 2:  right? That like maybe starlink ends up being everybody's

311
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,880
Speaker 2:  competitor or some of these other companies that satellite becomes the thing

312
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,800
Speaker 2:  where you don't have to lay new fiber, you don't have to deal with all of

313
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,240
Speaker 2:  the bureaucracy of bringing a cable competitor to a new neighborhood. Like

314
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,560
Speaker 2:  their Verizon is installing fiber on my street

315
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,640
Speaker 2:  and they're out there basically right now doing it. And I was like, oh, when

316
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,440
Speaker 2:  do you think it's gonna be live? And they were like, I don't know, we're

317
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,520
Speaker 2:  thinking like two or three years. And so it's like, well this is, this is

318
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,080
Speaker 2:  a whole thing. Whereas like in theory, right, starlink could show up and

319
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,920
Speaker 2:  scale pretty fast, but is there any sort of evidence for

320
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,840
Speaker 2:  optimism that satellite can start to do some of that good work people are

321
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,520
Speaker 2:  hoping it might do?

322
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,640
Speaker 6:  Again, this is tricky. Like I think the scaling fast bit in particular

323
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,400
Speaker 6:  is tricky because they have to like launching satellites is

324
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,920
Speaker 6:  harder than just putting wires in the earth.

325
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,960
Speaker 2:  I don't know, I think these dudes who have been on my street might disagree

326
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,600
Speaker 2:  without assessment but I It's true. You're

327
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,080
Speaker 6:  Probably still right. I mean yeah, but how long would they take if they were

328
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,600
Speaker 6:  launching things into space? So I don't, it's tricky. Like I think the big

329
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,560
Speaker 6:  hopes for satellite internet are largely like about the future that

330
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,520
Speaker 6:  like five or 10 years from now, this will be a much better way rather than

331
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,400
Speaker 6:  being like I can do this right now. You know, this was a survey of

332
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,360
Speaker 6:  what people are doing right now and almost no one is getting satellite internet.

333
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,080
Speaker 6:  Like the of the bills we got, we got like

334
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,000
Speaker 6:  two hundred and seventy, two hundred

335
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:59,120
Speaker 6:  seventy four satellite internet bills. So like I guess it's around 1%.

336
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,800
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's a little more than 1% but like that's really not a lot. And the

337
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,720
Speaker 6:  other thing is, and this is not gonna shock people who have considered

338
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,080
Speaker 6:  doing it, it's like not cheaper right now. Right? Right. So again, it's possible

339
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,920
Speaker 6:  that it will become cheaper in the future. I think that's part of

340
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,320
Speaker 6:  the idea. But they're also still in the process of building out the network

341
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,160
Speaker 6:  and they have to, they're investing in infrastructure still. So we're not,

342
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,840
Speaker 6:  I don't think anyone's expecting like huge reductions in the cost of

343
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,040
Speaker 6:  starlink in the next year. Actually this is the other one. So

344
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,920
Speaker 6:  41 starlink bills two others

345
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,880
Speaker 6:  with over a hundred. So ViaSat and HughesNet, and this is

346
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,240
Speaker 6:  part of the other thing is like Elon comes in and likes to pretend he invented

347
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,760
Speaker 6:  things starlink does have, they're doing a lower earth orbit thing and it

348
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,480
Speaker 6:  is like a technical advantage over the existing ones, but less than 20% of

349
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,400
Speaker 6:  the actual satellite bills we got were Starling.

350
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,560
Speaker 6:  Right? There are these other bigger providers who have been doing it for

351
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,440
Speaker 6:  a long time and I think are not as aggressively investing in infrastructure

352
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,640
Speaker 6:  and their service is also like not hugely

353
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,560
Speaker 6:  adopted and not wildly better than just terrestrial fiber.

354
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's it's gonna be interesting to see if that goes from

355
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,000
Speaker 2:  like will it be readily available? Seems like if you've fast forward far

356
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,400
Speaker 2:  enough, like probably yes, will it solve these existing problems that we

357
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,320
Speaker 2:  have or just be another option that has all the same problems. I would also

358
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,720
Speaker 2:  say probably yes, but hey, maybe we'll be optimistic about it. Is there any

359
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,680
Speaker 2:  prognosis that comes out of this? Like is there anything we can sort of look

360
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,560
Speaker 2:  at and be like, okay, here is a, a problem with a solution or it

361
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,080
Speaker 2:  feels like in a lot of ways this just kind of confirms in a, in a real way

362
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,520
Speaker 2:  what a lot of people have kind of instinctively felt for a long time.

363
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,880
Speaker 6:  So like usually we talk about broadband and we're like, we need more fiber.

364
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,520
Speaker 6:  Like there are these people living in rural areas that can't get broadband

365
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,480
Speaker 6:  and then the telecoms say like, well it doesn't make economic sense to run

366
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,480
Speaker 6:  all this fiber all the way up to them. And, and we go back and forth and

367
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,440
Speaker 6:  it, it does feel like in some ways a political sort of stalemate. We

368
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,280
Speaker 6:  can pass laws about how bills are allowed to work.

369
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,440
Speaker 6:  And I will say they're one thing that's happening right now and this is out

370
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,160
Speaker 6:  of the FTC that we hear about like trying to break up Facebook and

371
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,040
Speaker 6:  Instagram and everything, but they also have much simpler things where they're

372
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,720
Speaker 6:  like, you can't, the rule about surprise billing

373
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,640
Speaker 6:  where you're paying like 40 bucks a month for six months and

374
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,240
Speaker 6:  then it gets suddenly you're paying a hundred bucks a month, is

375
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,120
Speaker 6:  they're passing rules about hey you can't do that. It's very easy to

376
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,520
Speaker 6:  imagine saying, okay, you can rent them a router,

377
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,280
Speaker 6:  you can charge data charges but you cannot

378
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,880
Speaker 6:  do fees beyond that. Those are the only kind of fees that are allowed. You

379
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,160
Speaker 6:  know, we, we wouldn't need an act of congress for doing that. FTC would just

380
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,360
Speaker 6:  have to say, we consider this anti-competitive, you're not allowed to do

381
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,960
Speaker 6:  it anymore. I'm sure we would have fun in the courts with that, but that's

382
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,000
Speaker 6:  like a real thing that could happen. And I think part of

383
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,280
Speaker 6:  the new kind of antitrust consumer protection push,

384
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,880
Speaker 6:  this is like the lower hanging fruit. So it's not as sexy as

385
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,760
Speaker 6:  breaking up Facebook and like, you know, requisitioning, they

386
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,440
Speaker 6:  want to take Mark Zuckerberg's dog and have him owned by the state and it's

387
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,160
Speaker 6:  not as sexy as that, but it is just in a very real

388
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,400
Speaker 6:  way, these fees are annoying. They make a lot of people's lives

389
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,440
Speaker 6:  worse in a very small way and it would be better if we

390
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,160
Speaker 6:  got rid of them. And I think that's if you will it, it is no dream.

391
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,440
Speaker 6:  We can live in that world if we want to.

392
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,880
Speaker 2:  I like it that plus buy your own router. We can at least make the world a

393
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,080
Speaker 2:  little better.

394
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,800
Speaker 6:  Take the lawn your own hands, that's how you can fight fees at

395
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,400
Speaker 2:  Home. Vigilante router ownership. I love it. All right Russell,

396
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,560
Speaker 2:  thank you. Appreciate it as always. Of

397
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:36,720
Speaker 6:  Course.

398
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,640
Speaker 2:  We're gonna take a break and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna talk

399
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,840
Speaker 2:  about Ein because this is the Verge cast and we like to talk about E Ink.

400
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,640
Speaker 2:  We'll be right back.

401
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,920
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. A couple of weeks ago was the 15th anniversary

402
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,720
Speaker 2:  of the introduction of Amazon's first ever Kindle.

403
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,480
Speaker 2:  It's kind of hard to remember now all these years later, but the first

404
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,040
Speaker 2:  Kindle was a big deal. It's really funny to listen to the videos

405
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,960
Speaker 2:  explaining how it worked from 2007 before anybody knew what

406
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,000
Speaker 2:  this thing was. When you want to pick a new book to read off of your home

407
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,880
Speaker 2:  screen, use your thumb to roll the cursor up or down and then press the select

408
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,640
Speaker 2:  wheel to make your selection. If you need larger letters, change the size

409
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,800
Speaker 2:  of the text by pressing the text key on the keyboard. There are six font

410
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,640
Speaker 2:  sizes to choose from. Use whatever works for you, big or small. The

411
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,440
Speaker 2:  Kindle had a big promise it was gonna change the way that we think about

412
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,960
Speaker 2:  book reading and even the way that books themselves work.

413
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:18,080
Speaker 2:  So after 15 years, did it, has the Kindle changed reader

414
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,760
Speaker 2:  behavior? Has it changed books forever? I wanted to talk about this with

415
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,440
Speaker 2:  of course Verge managing editor and eing super fan Alex Kranz.

416
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,200
Speaker 2:  Alex continues to be the only other person I've ever worked with who

417
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,120
Speaker 2:  thinks e-readers are interesting and she's right and so am I. They're

418
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,040
Speaker 2:  interesting. There's a lot to get into here. So let's just dive in.

419
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,600
Speaker 2:  Hi Alex.

420
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,560
Speaker 8:  Hello.

421
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,280
Speaker 2:  This is the most Alex possible vergecast segment. I could not be more excited

422
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,520
Speaker 2:  that this is what's happening here.

423
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,680
Speaker 10:  I'm very excited to talk about Ein.

424
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,480
Speaker 2:  So it's the 15th anniversary of Kindle. What was your first Kindle?

425
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,400
Speaker 10:  My first e reader was not a Kindle. Okay. It was the OG

426
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,840
Speaker 10:  Nook.

427
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,560
Speaker 2:  The OG Nook was very good. Underrated had

428
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,280
Speaker 10:  Like the light up screen at the bottom and everything. Loved that. But

429
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,040
Speaker 10:  my original Kindle would've been I think

430
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,800
Speaker 10:  maybe the OG Paper White. Okay. Because I, I was real nook

431
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,840
Speaker 10:  until then.

432
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah, there's a definite like how Barnes and Noble blew this

433
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,480
Speaker 2:  so badly story to be done at some point in the future. They're still making

434
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,160
Speaker 2:  nooks, which I think is sort of lovely and charming next

435
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,280
Speaker 10:  Week on the Verge Cast,

436
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,960
Speaker 2:  Eight hours on the new Nook. Yeah, so I think, I think we probably got

437
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,200
Speaker 2:  into it about the same time. The first one I remember having was the Kindle

438
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,000
Speaker 2:  Touch, which was like the first one that had a touchscreen. It just had

439
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,400
Speaker 2:  that little like hamburger menu button at the bottom. But everything else

440
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,560
Speaker 2:  was a touchscreen. And that was the first one I actually like plunked down

441
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,680
Speaker 2:  money and bought. And the thing I didn't realize, and this is one of the

442
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,600
Speaker 2:  things I wanna talk about here, was that by buying that Kindle, I

443
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,560
Speaker 2:  was signing myself up to only buy Kindles for the rest of my life

444
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,240
Speaker 2:  because the Kindle lock in is so, so, so, so

445
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,960
Speaker 2:  strong. And once you're in, you're in and there's no leaving. And I now

446
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,800
Speaker 2:  own, I don't know, hundreds of books on Kindle and I can't use another device

447
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,760
Speaker 2:  even if I want to. And it's 2011. Me was not aware of this

448
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,520
Speaker 2:  and yet here we

449
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,520
Speaker 10:  Are. I distinctly remember being very upset because I was like, I've got

450
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,760
Speaker 10:  all these books on my Barnes and Noble account, I can't, I gotta, I should

451
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,080
Speaker 10:  be able to transfer those over it. And then I found Collibra, which is one

452
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,000
Speaker 10:  of the most powerful and horrible pieces of software ever made. It's

453
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,600
Speaker 10:  ugly. It is a nightmare to use. I

454
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,560
Speaker 10:  hate it with a passion of a thousand sons but it works because

455
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,440
Speaker 10:  I took all of my Nook books and ripped the d r m off,

456
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,960
Speaker 10:  which is totally legal I'm sure. And put them all on my Kindle.

457
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,480
Speaker 10:  It's a lot hard. It's a little harder to do on the other way around. It's

458
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,320
Speaker 10:  possible but it's a little bit more of a

459
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,200
Speaker 2:  Hassle. It's messy And Amazon has never been particularly

460
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,240
Speaker 2:  interested in making it easy for you to leave the Kindle ecosystem.

461
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:50,240
Speaker 10:  Amazon makes it so easy to do so much, right? Like they make it

462
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,040
Speaker 10:  easy to just get the Kindle you, you turn it on, you download the book,

463
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,920
Speaker 10:  you read it, you're done. That's super super e easy. There's no like

464
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,720
Speaker 10:  weirdness there. If you ever wanna be like explore, you're like oh

465
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,520
Speaker 10:  don't wanna get a book from the library. Oh did somebody send me

466
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,960
Speaker 10:  something to read? No, no. Terror not allowed. You're just gonna be sad.

467
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,200
Speaker 2:  Well and that to me is like the sort of story of the Kindle. So I was going

468
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,960
Speaker 2:  back over all the, all the old Kindles and two things jumped out to me and

469
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,680
Speaker 2:  we, we can dig into whichever one you want to first. But two things jumped

470
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,400
Speaker 2:  out to me. One is that it's very odd that the very

471
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,200
Speaker 2:  first Kindle was by far the most

472
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,960
Speaker 2:  feature rich one. Yes. It had a headphone jack, it had a speaker,

473
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,240
Speaker 2:  it had an SD card slot, you could, it had always on 3G

474
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,280
Speaker 10:  The dial.

475
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Like it was such a powerful thing and all they've done in

476
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,000
Speaker 2:  15 years since is just strip stuff away. And I kind of

477
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,600
Speaker 2:  get why. But I also think that's a bummer. And then the second thing that

478
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,280
Speaker 2:  jumped out to me was that Amazon, it appears never for

479
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,160
Speaker 2:  one second invested in Kindle software. Like it is insane

480
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,280
Speaker 2:  to me how similar it is to what it was 15 years ago on all parts.

481
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,680
Speaker 10:  Amazon doesn't really invest in software across the board, right? Because

482
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,240
Speaker 10:  like you go and you use Good Reads, which is the defacto

483
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,160
Speaker 10:  book tracking software website, whatever you wanna call it that we

484
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,080
Speaker 10:  all use, I now use Story Graph more cuz it's prettier and does the job better

485
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,960
Speaker 10:  and is not owned by Amazon. Yeah But like they bought it and they're like

486
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,040
Speaker 10:  we got it all right. And it feels like the same thing with the Kindle. They're

487
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,720
Speaker 10:  like okay we designed it, it works. We're out to the point that like

488
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,440
Speaker 10:  when they did the merging with Comicology and they merged the two

489
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,800
Speaker 10:  stores and and libraries together, now

490
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:32,880
Speaker 10:  I go to read a book and it's just like would you like to read this Superman

491
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,360
Speaker 10:  comic you bought three months ago? Cuz that's what we're gonna suggest You

492
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,280
Speaker 10:  read right on your, your beautiful Kindle. It's not a good experience by

493
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,800
Speaker 10:  the way.

494
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,720
Speaker 2:  No, it's terrible. Well and the comics is is a real bummer actually because

495
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,360
Speaker 2:  there have been a couple of moments where Amazon had a really

496
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,160
Speaker 2:  like interesting opportunity to try new things and I think to

497
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,000
Speaker 2:  some extent the the like reason it has gotten less future rich over

498
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,880
Speaker 2:  time I think is because the goal is to have it for reading, right? Like

499
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,200
Speaker 2:  Amazon is crystal clear about this and and Dave Limp even said though to

500
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,560
Speaker 2:  us on this show not that long ago, that like they are not trying to build

501
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,760
Speaker 2:  an iPad, they're not trying to build anything other than a device for reading.

502
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,160
Speaker 10:  And I think that's the right call by the way. I think that's actually like

503
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,960
Speaker 10:  having done the devices that do everything, I totally think this

504
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,560
Speaker 10:  thing just does Reading is the perfect call.

505
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,080
Speaker 2:  Yes. But, but

506
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,240
Speaker 10:  Yeah

507
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,600
Speaker 2:  It just as reading I think is like a slightly larger umbrella than

508
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,280
Speaker 2:  the things that Amazon covers.

509
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,520
Speaker 10:  Just as Amazon's idea of reading. Great.

510
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,480
Speaker 2:  It's for reading.dot dot books on Kindle that

511
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,000
Speaker 2:  have been there for 15 years and no one has touched since because it's like

512
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,440
Speaker 2:  I, I wrote this story five years ago about on the 10th anniversary about

513
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,040
Speaker 2:  like when is Amazon gonna follow through on its promise of like reinventing

514
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,880
Speaker 2:  books? And they've sort of intermittently tried, there was like the Kindle

515
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,440
Speaker 2:  singles thing and there was the Kindle cereals thing and those were basically

516
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,480
Speaker 2:  just shorter books.

517
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,680
Speaker 10:  Remember when they tried to like say just do your fan fiction and we'll

518
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,600
Speaker 10:  give you money for it. Yeah, exactly. And then everybody was like, copyright

519
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,240
Speaker 10:  sir, please

520
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,640
Speaker 2:  I wish they had tried harder. Like could have been great. Like what if every

521
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,040
Speaker 2:  book you read was also like a wacky exploration through the world of the

522
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,920
Speaker 2:  fan fiction of that book? That'd be so fun. I'm into that. Yeah. But then

523
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,520
Speaker 2:  there have been these moments and I think comics is like the most obvious

524
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,400
Speaker 2:  one where to just say we are going to faithfully reproduce what it

525
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,920
Speaker 2:  looks like on a piece of paper is actually like an unimaginative version

526
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,840
Speaker 2:  of the future. And they could have done so many cooler things with comics

527
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,600
Speaker 2:  and they just didn't. And I feel like it drives everyone insane. But

528
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,720
Speaker 10:  It was wild because Comicology, I mean we could turn this entire thing into

529
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,520
Speaker 10:  a rant about Comicology, but Comicology actually did do more right When

530
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,440
Speaker 10:  Comicology app first came out you would read a comic comic book and it would

531
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,120
Speaker 10:  actually be like, okay we're gonna zoom in on this panel and then we're

532
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,400
Speaker 10:  gonna swipe over to this next panel and it would give this additional movement

533
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,800
Speaker 10:  to it and and tell you exactly where your eye needs to go. And that was

534
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,320
Speaker 10:  really exciting and fun. And then when this merging completed earlier this

535
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,640
Speaker 10:  year, they were like, no, no, no, no that's all gone. You read it like a

536
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,080
Speaker 10:  book because this is the Kindle way

537
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,000
Speaker 2:  Which is so it's just weird. Like there there's a

538
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,160
Speaker 2:  religion on the Kindle team that I think is just wrong in that particular

539
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,360
Speaker 2:  case.

540
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:10,320
Speaker 10:  I think it's partially a religion and I think it's partially a symptom

541
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,800
Speaker 10:  of when you are the biggest player when like the closest

542
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,320
Speaker 10:  competitor in the United States is Cobo, which most people don't

543
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,160
Speaker 10:  know and Barnes and Noble, which most people forgot sells e-readers.

544
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Barnes and Noble's just an empty store at the mall.

545
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,600
Speaker 10:  There's not a lot of competition, there's not a lot of need Right. To go

546
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,320
Speaker 10:  do more because the big competition is happening in other markets that

547
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,240
Speaker 10:  Amazon doesn't really participate in and it doesn't need to. And so it's

548
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,480
Speaker 10:  like, yeah, why do I need to go do all this weird wacky stuff? Why spend

549
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,360
Speaker 10:  the resources on that?

550
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,640
Speaker 2:  This is one of those interesting cases where like I really wish there had

551
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,320
Speaker 2:  been meaningful competition because I think there's so much interesting

552
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,960
Speaker 2:  stuff to do in e-book creators and I also wish there were more competition

553
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,640
Speaker 2:  on the like E Ink and EPA screen side of things because I think that has

554
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,800
Speaker 2:  also held this whole industry back.

555
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,960
Speaker 10:  It's just one company. Yeah,

556
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,800
Speaker 2:  That's exactly right. They're like what if there were other people making

557
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,560
Speaker 2:  this kind of thing instead of just this one unbelievably slow

558
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,520
Speaker 2:  moving company that doesn't seem to be able to ship its good ideas in any

559
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,920
Speaker 2:  kind of meaningful amount of time. And so I think that has held Amazon back

560
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:14,160
Speaker 2:  its ability to do whatever it wants because it just decimated all

561
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,840
Speaker 2:  of its competitors basically immediately has held it back. And then there's

562
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,200
Speaker 2:  this thing where I think they decided early on

563
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,160
Speaker 2:  that they don't wanna make money on the Kindle, they just wanna make money

564
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,560
Speaker 2:  on selling you stuff through the Kindle. So they yeah basically got to a

565
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,280
Speaker 2:  point where it was like okay, we have to make this thing as cheap as physically

566
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,480
Speaker 2:  possible such that more people will buy it such that we can sell them more

567
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,920
Speaker 2:  stuff and put all three of those two things together. And it's like of course

568
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,120
Speaker 2:  they haven't really innovated in any meaningful way. Like why would

569
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,680
Speaker 10:  They, it's a bummer because it feels like, you know there's the TV brands

570
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,360
Speaker 10:  and there's a lot of TV brands and the one TV brand you never buy is

571
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,560
Speaker 10:  the best buy in-house brand Insignia. Cause it's

572
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:50,600
Speaker 2:  Like

573
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:55,320
Speaker 10:  So mediocre that you're just like, well it does the job but what what

574
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,720
Speaker 10:  cost?

575
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,800
Speaker 2:  Right. It is technically a television. It

576
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,400
Speaker 10:  Feels like sometimes with the Kindle that Insignia one

577
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,640
Speaker 10:  like what if all the other TV brands went away and it was just Insignia

578
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,560
Speaker 10:  And so you're like does the job but couldn't it do more? And

579
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,240
Speaker 10:  we've seen that. We've seen it from, we've seen it from Cobo, we saw the

580
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,440
Speaker 10:  original Nook, we've seen it from a lot of these Chinese companies and and

581
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,400
Speaker 10:  German companies like Pocketbook. Like there's more to it and Amazon's

582
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,200
Speaker 10:  just doesn't have interest in that. But it still makes a nice device a good

583
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,800
Speaker 10:  enough advice.

584
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean this is the thing, right? Like I say all of this and yet I love

585
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,640
Speaker 2:  my Kindle. I have, I have the latest paper white and it is for the thing

586
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,400
Speaker 2:  that it does, it is terrific, right? Like I do wish it had a speaker

587
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,400
Speaker 2:  so that I could like put it down. One of my, the ways I use my

588
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,480
Speaker 2:  Kindle is I like, I will like read on the Kindle while I'm brushing my teeth

589
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,800
Speaker 2:  or whatever and being able to just be like, yeah play for the next 30 seconds

590
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,000
Speaker 2:  and like put it down on the sink and have it play out loud. Oh that would

591
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,280
Speaker 2:  be magic would be amazing, right? And it's like it's just sitting right there

592
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,240
Speaker 2:  and it drives me nuts. It's just right there. But, so this is the thing that

593
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,560
Speaker 2:  I've always had a hard time with with the Kindle is squaring this idea of

594
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,520
Speaker 2:  like, it's just supposed to be a reading device. They just wanna make something

595
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,280
Speaker 2:  that feels like a paper book and actually like paper books don't have

596
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,800
Speaker 2:  speakers so neither should Kindle. It's like fine with the idea that there's

597
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,840
Speaker 2:  actually all this other interesting stuff out there in the e-reader space

598
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,320
Speaker 2:  that Amazon should have done. So you have used all of these devices, like

599
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,760
Speaker 2:  are there things that you're like if they put you in charge of the Kindle

600
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,360
Speaker 2:  that you would just like lift off of other devices and be like, this needs

601
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,160
Speaker 2:  to be in the Kindle tomorrow.

602
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,760
Speaker 10:  The biggest thing that I like is, is the flexibility of other devices, right?

603
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,200
Speaker 10:  The reason I I keep going back to Onyx books is because they have a really

604
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,760
Speaker 10:  good version of an Android e Ink tablet, which means I, I don't just, I'm

605
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,720
Speaker 10:  not just stuck in Kindle's universe. I can use the Nook, I can

606
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,560
Speaker 10:  use Vis, which is like manga and stuff like that. I can go to

607
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,800
Speaker 10:  all these different apps and just enjoy them and I don't have to worry about

608
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,360
Speaker 10:  like, oh is that, is there a Moby version of this? Right? Like okay

609
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,840
Speaker 10:  I gotta go loading Collibra and like convert it and do all of that.

610
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,160
Speaker 10:  That's the biggest one. And I just don't see Amazon ever doing that because

611
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,440
Speaker 10:  yes we're gonna allow all of our competitors no matter how small onto our

612
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,080
Speaker 10:  device. That's never gonna happen. No, but I do think there's like

613
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,200
Speaker 10:  a thoughtfulness to these other devices with how the page

614
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,120
Speaker 10:  turning buttons work and how like it took how long for

615
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,960
Speaker 10:  Amazon to embrace u s bbc, right? It doesn't experiment with Color

616
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,480
Speaker 10:  E Ink at all. And like Color Ink is not in a place where it's

617
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,160
Speaker 10:  necessarily great but it

618
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,520
Speaker 10:  isn't a place where like having a big color e Ink

619
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,520
Speaker 10:  kindle for kids to read like picture books on Bernstein bears,

620
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,840
Speaker 10:  all of that stuff. That would be great. That would be like an instant winner.

621
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,280
Speaker 10:  And instead they're like how about for $99 we give you the

622
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,920
Speaker 10:  crummiest of Android tablets, just the

623
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,880
Speaker 10:  worst of the worst for your small children. And it's like, or I could

624
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,560
Speaker 10:  give them something for books and just books embrace the actual

625
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,320
Speaker 10:  Kindle ethos with these things. Yep. And so it's a bummer that they

626
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,800
Speaker 10:  haven't embraced it and they're not looking to these other companies and

627
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,080
Speaker 10:  and how they're doing these things and but mostly the companies, the big

628
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,480
Speaker 10:  differentiation is flexibility.

629
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well to me the middle ground there that I've always hoped Amazon

630
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,440
Speaker 2:  would do is basically give you a useful service for

631
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,880
Speaker 2:  sending stuff from the web to your Kindle. Yeah. And this is the kind of

632
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,800
Speaker 2:  thing that like it technically exists. I used Insta paper for a long

633
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,840
Speaker 2:  time and you could like send a digest of your Insta paper stuff to the Kindle

634
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,560
Speaker 2:  but it was janky and didn't look very good And they have a desktop

635
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,800
Speaker 2:  app that you can like download PDFs and upload them to your Kindle and that

636
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,080
Speaker 2:  doesn't work very well and it formats PDFs terribly and it's like what I

637
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,040
Speaker 2:  always wished Amazon would do is exactly what Cobo did with Pocket,

638
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,080
Speaker 2:  which is basically just, yeah integrate. You can just log into pocket

639
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:38,120
Speaker 2:  through your Cobo and read all of the stuff

640
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,800
Speaker 2:  that you'd saved on the web in this nice connected synced

641
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,320
Speaker 2:  interface. And that to me is like the simplest thing and the

642
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,160
Speaker 2:  absolute only reason I can think that Amazon hasn't thought to do it is because

643
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Speaker 2:  it knows that's what people want. But it means they would probably buy fewer

644
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,040
Speaker 2:  books. And again that is the whole point of the Kindle is to just give

645
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,480
Speaker 2:  you a thing that is easy to buy books from Amazon because there is no chance

646
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Speaker 2:  that a, they haven't thought of it. Somebody I guarantee has been like, what

647
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,280
Speaker 2:  if people could read the internet? Have we heard of the internet And

648
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,160
Speaker 2:  somebody shot it down because it would lead to fewer books being sold and

649
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,880
Speaker 2:  that's just the only way it possibly could have gone. And it drives me absolutely

650
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,320
Speaker 2:  up the wall cuz it's just, it's just right there.

651
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,200
Speaker 10:  Well and that's why like there's no really streamlined

652
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:22,960
Speaker 10:  library integration. The Cobo has a terrible That's so true. Library

653
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,880
Speaker 10:  integration by the way. Absolutely nightmarish. I had to help my mom set

654
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,840
Speaker 10:  it up from many miles away and talk to like

655
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,240
Speaker 10:  a librarian in Texas about it. It's

656
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,920
Speaker 2:  Terrible. And Cobos the one that is like proud of itself for this like Cobo

657
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,320
Speaker 2:  throws out of its way to talk about its library integr

658
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,240
Speaker 10:  This trash integration and Lippi knows that people

659
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,120
Speaker 10:  have Kindles and so it's like, okay well we're gonna actually baby step

660
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:50,000
Speaker 10:  walk you through how to put this on your, your Kindle.

661
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,560
Speaker 10:  We're gonna figure that out for you. And it's like, or Amazon could just

662
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,840
Speaker 10:  do that and they're not going to, because instead they want you to go and

663
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,680
Speaker 10:  buy Kindle Unlimited for every month and put your money

664
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,520
Speaker 10:  in that way. And so like they just constantly like to to gate keep.

665
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,280
Speaker 10:  It's a bummer.

666
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's Amazon's whole thing. Like they're super customer first unless

667
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,120
Speaker 2:  you don't wanna buy from Amazon and then get outta your face.

668
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,640
Speaker 10:  Another thing though, I will say, I think that they haven't really embraced

669
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,440
Speaker 10:  it. I think they could and we're seeing it with the, the scribe, right?

670
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:22,600
Speaker 10:  Is welcome tablet, like that interface because

671
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,200
Speaker 10:  E ink, capacitive touch is a nightmarish thing

672
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,920
Speaker 10:  usually. Yes. You have to really, really tweak it cuz otherwise the time

673
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,680
Speaker 10:  from touch to actually seeing something on that really slow E ink display

674
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,480
Speaker 10:  is super, super long and laggy and you want to kill someone. And some

675
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,920
Speaker 10:  companies have figured this out like the, the Onyx books Leaf too, which

676
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,560
Speaker 10:  I've got a review of that coming up soon on the verge.com

677
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,840
Speaker 10:  has figured out that capacitive touch and made it a lot faster and made

678
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,600
Speaker 10:  it feel snappier. Not as snappy as welcome, but like snappy enough.

679
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,200
Speaker 10:  And Kendall really hasn't done that. Kendall is kind of like, oh yeah, you

680
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,680
Speaker 10:  can type on this but we're gonna make you regret it every

681
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,840
Speaker 10:  step of the way.

682
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:03,840
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I remember. So I, I was listening to an episode of Ezra

683
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,760
Speaker 2:  Klein's podcast a while ago and he was talking about basically like how he

684
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,960
Speaker 2:  gets all his reading done and his thing was like, I read

685
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,840
Speaker 2:  basically exclusively on a Kindle, even if I own the paper

686
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,280
Speaker 2:  book, I will buy it on Kindle because it's easier to take notes that I can

687
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,600
Speaker 2:  then like search for and sync through. And I like really took that to heart

688
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,840
Speaker 2:  and I was like, okay, I too am gonna do this. Right? I wanna have all of

689
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,560
Speaker 2:  my highlights and notes in one place where I can search for them, I can find

690
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,120
Speaker 2:  them later. All this stuff I don't think I have ever once

691
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,960
Speaker 2:  typed out a note on my Kindle that was like not

692
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,920
Speaker 2:  full of typos. Like I it's just impossible.

693
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,080
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Horrible, horrible

694
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,200
Speaker 2:  Experience. Yeah. So now I have to go back through and be like, I typed herm

695
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,720
Speaker 2:  uwf like what did, what did that mean? It was a great idea that I

696
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,920
Speaker 2:  had when I was reading this. Like, all right, cool,

697
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,800
Speaker 10:  You have to like do a couple of steps, you're all right. Yeah. Gotta like

698
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,640
Speaker 10:  plan it pack in the time to interpret what you were trying to write.

699
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,480
Speaker 10:  And it shouldn't be that way. Like it is very, very easy to

700
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,400
Speaker 10:  make it smart, but that would require having a slightly more powerful processor,

701
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,360
Speaker 10:  which would increase the cost of the device. And they're like, no, we're

702
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,600
Speaker 10:  gonna put the most garbage processor in here. We're gonna put good enough

703
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,520
Speaker 10:  capacitive touch screen in here. Like we're gonna do just good enough

704
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,280
Speaker 10:  right across the board and if you want quality, go to China.

705
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,640
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So, okay, so the, the last thing I'm curious about is this

706
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,120
Speaker 2:  idea of like reinventing the book, right? And they, I think with

707
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,440
Speaker 2:  comics and stuff, like, I think we're very much on the same page that like,

708
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,720
Speaker 2:  there's actually a lot more they should do there. But I think for a long

709
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,520
Speaker 2:  time Amazon used to say to me at least that they had all these big interesting

710
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,320
Speaker 2:  ideas about like what a book should be, right? The idea that, oh, it's just

711
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,680
Speaker 2:  a collection of chapters in a row is like an outdated thing and now that

712
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,920
Speaker 2:  it's digital, what if you, what if it was rem mixable and what if you could

713
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,560
Speaker 2:  choose your own adventure through a book and people would read and, and a

714
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,080
Speaker 2:  different, and I, I've sort of gotten to the point where I'm, I'm done waiting

715
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,240
Speaker 2:  for that and now I kind of think like the Kindle will eventually just die

716
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,160
Speaker 2:  at the hand of print books and and we're just gonna go, we're gonna go

717
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,040
Speaker 2:  right back to where we started.

718
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,360
Speaker 10:  I don't think it'll die at the hand of print. I think it's, it's the internet.

719
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,280
Speaker 10:  I think Wattpad and Archive of our own are are

720
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,720
Speaker 10:  where we're seeing that kind of like future and we're seeing that experimentation

721
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,240
Speaker 10:  and we see it trickle down into mainstream books a

722
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,600
Speaker 2:  Lot. Wait, like gimme an example. Like what, what does that look like? I

723
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:10,680
Speaker 2:  think

724
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,440
Speaker 10:  One of the first examples I saw was when Wattpad and Archive of her own

725
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,400
Speaker 10:  were like, okay, all of our characters are our age and we are 17

726
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,240
Speaker 10:  year old girls writing these, these works of fiction and we text all

727
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,080
Speaker 10:  the time. And so for years when you go and read a book and texting,

728
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:30,280
Speaker 10:  it's like this person says this italics and it's

729
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,920
Speaker 10:  just like this brutal, excruciating thing to

730
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,040
Speaker 10:  read. And they understood, oh actually this is just how people talk.

731
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,000
Speaker 10:  And so I'll just say I text back and stuff or sometimes I'll do a, they'll

732
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,360
Speaker 10:  do a big text bubble and they'll go and they'll print it out including all

733
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,760
Speaker 10:  the different emojis that they wanna use and put that in there. And when

734
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,400
Speaker 10:  you watch that rendered on a Kindle, you're like Osh, yikes.

735
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,280
Speaker 10:  But when you look at it on the internet you're like, that's sick, that's

736
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,520
Speaker 10:  cool. I didn't even pause to think about it. I just kept reading cuz it

737
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,120
Speaker 10:  made sense.

738
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:03,680
Speaker 2:  I love that. And that feels like that's the kind of thing that I think is,

739
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,600
Speaker 2:  again, it's right in that zone for Amazon, right? Like it's, if people were

740
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,000
Speaker 2:  like, oh I wanna watch movies on my Kindle, like Amazon, I think it's correctly

741
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,120
Speaker 2:  gonna be like, no that's not what this device is for. But that thing you

742
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,240
Speaker 2:  just described, like that's, that's what books are, that's what books should

743
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,480
Speaker 2:  be like. Yeah, get there, get

744
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,400
Speaker 10:  There. But I I they're just when are they gonna do it? I think

745
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,160
Speaker 10:  it's only when people shout loud enough and they have to shout really, really

746
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,640
Speaker 10:  loud because how long have been people been shouting to improve good reads

747
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:35,120
Speaker 10:  to improve integration with these other services And Amazon hasn't done

748
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,040
Speaker 10:  it so they have to first listen and I don't know if they're ready to do

749
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,200
Speaker 10:  that.

750
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,320
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that is very fair. And I think the like big goal that they've always

751
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,920
Speaker 2:  had that it should just feel like a piece of paper and be something you can

752
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,320
Speaker 2:  like crumple and roll up and throw around is like exciting and awesome and

753
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,320
Speaker 2:  I desperately also want that. Yes. It's also not up to Amazon, it's up to

754
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,120
Speaker 2:  ein this one company that I am sort of done waiting for

755
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,920
Speaker 2:  to deliver this crazy vision to me.

756
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,880
Speaker 10:  We're starting to see a little bit of change there. Right. Okay. Like ein

757
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,720
Speaker 10:  is, is is starting to improve its development especially in the color

758
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,800
Speaker 10:  E ink space cuz I think that's really where it comes. Like they've hit kind

759
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,160
Speaker 10:  of their limit with black and white e

760
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,280
Speaker 2:  Ink. Like it looks very good now we did it, they

761
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,200
Speaker 10:  Did it like the refresh rate is still really, really bad compared

762
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,840
Speaker 10:  to an LCD screen. But like everything else is good. If they can improve

763
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,720
Speaker 10:  the color then they can come back to improve the refresh rate then I assume

764
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,600
Speaker 10:  they can get enough customers buying the stuff. Cuz right now their market

765
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,440
Speaker 10:  is like Amazon who's like, okay we need like a few dozen to

766
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,240
Speaker 10:  sell Kindles this year. A few of these other smaller ERI Inc companies

767
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,000
Speaker 10:  which are still really, really small compared to phones and tablet business,

768
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,960
Speaker 10:  like this is a very small business compared to them. And then like signage

769
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,640
Speaker 10:  folks, right? That's their customer base. And if you have

770
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,000
Speaker 10:  the resources of an Amazon or an Apple, you could go and invest

771
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,320
Speaker 10:  and really accelerate that development. But Apple doesn't

772
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,120
Speaker 10:  care because they have no interest in ein. And while I'm sad about that,

773
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,320
Speaker 10:  I also understand it. It makes

774
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,640
Speaker 2:  Sense. Yeah. We're on record about that one. Amazon

775
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,920
Speaker 10:  Should care more. They should be putting a lot more resources into this

776
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,320
Speaker 10:  and they aren't, they, they kind of just say, okay, you've got the new displays

777
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,120
Speaker 10:  in Cool. Give us like six months. They, they're really

778
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,680
Speaker 10:  slow on on when they adopt these new display technologies from EIN

779
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,040
Speaker 10:  and I just think it could all be a lot faster, but they would have to again

780
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,720
Speaker 10:  care and not be in this race to the bottom of the price.

781
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,840
Speaker 2:  Right? Yeah. There, there comes a time when you would have to invest in that

782
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,480
Speaker 2:  in a big way. Instead of sitting there and saying, we won this market, we

783
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,360
Speaker 2:  will sit here and collect whatever spoils there are. So, okay, so my

784
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,960
Speaker 2:  actual last question for you is, I have spent a lot of time over the years

785
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,120
Speaker 2:  basically using a Kindle a lot and then saying this is ridiculous.

786
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,680
Speaker 2:  Why do I just have this one device that just says this one thing when I also

787
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,640
Speaker 2:  have an iPad that does that one thing, not quite as well, but pretty well

788
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,600
Speaker 2:  and also 1 million billion other things, including all of the

789
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,560
Speaker 2:  other apps I want to use to read. And I was going back to, you know,

790
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,800
Speaker 2:  2007 and it's like they launched the Kindle into a world in which the iPad

791
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,400
Speaker 2:  did not exist. Right? And tablets just became such a

792
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,680
Speaker 2:  thing not that long after that that like, and Amazon has spent a lot of time

793
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,560
Speaker 2:  building its own tablets and making Kindle apps to support those tablets.

794
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,960
Speaker 2:  And they've said a lot of things about like, we can't control where people

795
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,000
Speaker 2:  read. We wanna be everywhere that people are. Are you And I like the last

796
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,880
Speaker 2:  two people left to think this is a good idea. Is everybody else just using

797
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,000
Speaker 2:  tablets and happy with it?

798
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,040
Speaker 10:  No, I don't think that's true. Right? There's a lot of people who go out

799
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,640
Speaker 10:  and buy these e-readers and they still care about them. And I think

800
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:31,730
Speaker 10:  it's really important if you wanna read a book, if, if you wanna like immerse

801
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,370
Speaker 10:  yourself in a book because the minute you get a notification you're taken

802
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:37,810
Speaker 10:  out of the book, the minute you're like, oh I want to just, we all get that

803
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:41,410
Speaker 10:  urge suddenly to just go look at TikTok or Twitter or whatever and, and

804
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:45,170
Speaker 10:  like just be like, okay, I've read oh my brain and go over to do this other

805
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:48,890
Speaker 10:  thing. And it's really, really nice to be like, no, my phone's actually

806
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:52,690
Speaker 10:  on the other side of the room or whatever and, and go back into

807
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,930
Speaker 10:  the book. And I think that's, there's also the, everybody talks about the,

808
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:59,650
Speaker 10:  the ease of it on your eyes. Why I, while I think there's zero

809
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:03,610
Speaker 10:  science to support that, especially as these all now have big front

810
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:07,530
Speaker 10:  lights on them that are glaring more light at you, it's still

811
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:11,490
Speaker 10:  really true that it's great to go outside and read

812
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:15,610
Speaker 10:  an e Ink device and it's miserable to go outside and try to

813
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:19,570
Speaker 10:  read an iPad. Especially cuz the iPad is also what, seven times more

814
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,690
Speaker 10:  expensive at this point? Something like that. Yeah. And if you can keep

815
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:26,570
Speaker 10:  like that E Ink super focused device still relatively

816
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,570
Speaker 10:  affordable, it makes sense to be like, okay, this is my, my, my

817
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,730
Speaker 10:  reader, this is what I'm gonna bring when I have to go sit in the doctor's

818
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:37,690
Speaker 10:  office. My tablet will stay at home cuz my tablet does other things, but

819
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,530
Speaker 10:  I'm going to sit in the doctor's office and wait four hours because

820
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,130
Speaker 10:  doctor's offices never keep appointment times I got my Kindle.

821
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:45,770
Speaker 10:  Yeah,

822
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,690
Speaker 2:  No, I think that's right. And I, I think the like big galaxy brain take on

823
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,010
Speaker 2:  all of this, right? Is that like maybe we're in a world where Twitter is

824
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,370
Speaker 2:  collapsing and people are starting to think about screen time and there's

825
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:59,210
Speaker 2:  this idea of like, oh, I maybe shouldn't just sit here and be bombarded by

826
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:03,170
Speaker 2:  all of my apps all day. And then there's the Kindle, which is this like beautiful

827
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:07,490
Speaker 2:  quiet space in all of our technology that is actually, and I

828
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:10,570
Speaker 2:  don't like, I think that's a, that's a life I'd like to lead. I feel like

829
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:13,370
Speaker 2:  in a lot of ways I'm a very like, aspirational Kindle owner. Like I sort

830
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:16,890
Speaker 2:  of look at it and I'm like, Ugh, I love books and then I like hold my Kindle

831
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:20,410
Speaker 2:  in one hand while I just screw around on my phone. But like,

832
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,890
Speaker 2:  it does sort of represent like a slightly better version of our relationship

833
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:27,890
Speaker 2:  with technology that I think for me has just always been very appealing.

834
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,810
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I, that's what I like the most about it. I, I've even gotten, you

835
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,090
Speaker 10:  know, I go and I get these Android e Ink devices, which has sensibly let

836
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:38,250
Speaker 10:  me do all of those things, but some of them really poorly, do not watch

837
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:42,170
Speaker 10:  a video on an e Ink device. Just don't it. You'll be sad. And, and the

838
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,650
Speaker 10:  more I use it I realize like, oh, it's actually nice to just go back

839
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,770
Speaker 10:  to this. Like, I've been connected to the internet since the mid nineties.

840
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:53,490
Speaker 10:  I've been online all this time and sometimes it's nice

841
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,330
Speaker 10:  to not have all the distractions and just be able to say I'm reading a book

842
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,170
Speaker 10:  and not worry about somebody texting me or, or whatever.

843
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,090
Speaker 10:  Like, we should embrace it more. And I don't wanna be start

844
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:07,930
Speaker 10:  some weird cult about this. I know a lot of people are always like, yeah,

845
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,890
Speaker 10:  I'm one of those people that logs off and is very performative and proud

846
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:14,690
Speaker 10:  of it. But like, I think it's good for everybody to sometimes log off and,

847
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,530
Speaker 10:  and think about that. And I think the Kindle is a really great way to like

848
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,490
Speaker 10:  still have that gadget, still have that moment where you're like, yeah,

849
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:24,410
Speaker 10:  I'm, I'm using the technology but also like not worrying about what

850
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,090
Speaker 10:  Elon Musk is saying on Twitter right now.

851
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And if if he is saying it, it's, it's over there

852
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:32,120
Speaker 10:  So far over there. It's on the other side of the room. I have to like get

853
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,920
Speaker 10:  up. I have to pull the blanket off. No, too much work. Yeah, just keep

854
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,160
Speaker 10:  reading.

855
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:40,680
Speaker 2:  I hear that. All right, we gotta go but what, what are you reading? Recommend

856
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,320
Speaker 2:  something for the people.

857
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:45,000
Speaker 10:  Ooh, what am I reading? Nona The ninth. I am reading

858
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,600
Speaker 10:  Nona the Ninth. It is from Tamir

859
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,560
Speaker 10:  and it is the third in her series about

860
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,000
Speaker 10:  Neros in space. The first one, Gideon and the ninth won a bunch of

861
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,640
Speaker 10:  awards. The second one won some awards. This third one is a delightful

862
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,080
Speaker 10:  romp and I can't wait to see what happens or

863
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:08,200
Speaker 10:  what happens in the conclusion elect the ninth, which I think comes

864
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,760
Speaker 10:  out next year.

865
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:09,840
Speaker 2:  Nice. What

866
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,000
Speaker 10:  About

867
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,440
Speaker 2:  Yourself? I'm currently reading a book called The Travelers

868
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,960
Speaker 2:  came out a couple of years ago. I think it's by a guy named Chris, I think

869
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,920
Speaker 2:  Pavone or Pavoni or something. It's basically just like a super puy

870
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,600
Speaker 2:  spy novel, which it turns out is my absolute favorite thing to read. Like

871
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,040
Speaker 2:  yes, anything that involves like a, you know,

872
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:32,120
Speaker 2:  Renegade, former CIA operative who like

873
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,960
Speaker 2:  went out on his own but is still a good guy. Taking down the bad guys is

874
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,280
Speaker 2:  I'll just, I will read the infinity of those and there are infinity of them

875
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,240
Speaker 2:  and the travelers is really good. I'm a big fan.

876
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:42,920
Speaker 10:  Well I know what I'm doing next week.

877
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,800
Speaker 2:  There you go. Okay, we need to take a break, but then it turns out

878
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,200
Speaker 2:  we're not done with this subject yet. We'll be right back.

879
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:46,640
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. So just to give you a little inside look

880
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,360
Speaker 2:  into how the verge cast sausage gets made. Alex and I recorded that last

881
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,200
Speaker 2:  segment a couple of weeks ago, right around the Kindle anniversary, but

882
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,160
Speaker 2:  then it turned out that Alex had her hands on the Kindle scribe, the

883
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,800
Speaker 2:  most ambitious Kindle Amazon has ever made the whole time. So

884
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,760
Speaker 2:  obviously we needed to talk about it. Is this the next big thing,

885
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:09,720
Speaker 2:  the revolutionary Kindle that Amazon has so far refused to

886
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,520
Speaker 2:  make for us is this the next 15 years of Kindle. So I called Alex back to

887
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,360
Speaker 2:  ask all these questions. Hi again Alex. Hi. So you had a

888
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,240
Speaker 2:  scribe the whole time we were talking about the scribe the

889
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:20,760
Speaker 10:  Whole time.

890
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,560
Speaker 2:  That makes me so angry. Like for in, in ways I can't even describe

891
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,920
Speaker 2:  like the rage that I feel in not knowing the whole time

892
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:31,960
Speaker 10:  I had to keep a secret, you know, I had to respect agreements. Yeah, I really

893
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,760
Speaker 10:  wanted to keep it to myself. I didn't want anyone else to know about it.

894
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:38,720
Speaker 2:  So let, let's just like lay the land of the scribe because I think my

895
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,640
Speaker 2:  impression of it, I talked to a couple of people at Amazon before it came

896
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,800
Speaker 2:  out and then like I wrote sort of the like look a thing, it exists story

897
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:49,040
Speaker 2:  and my take on it was basically like this is a big

898
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,960
Speaker 2:  moment for Amazon. They're trying to do like the newest thing with the

899
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,920
Speaker 2:  Kindle. They've done like kind of since the first Kindle, right? Like am

900
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,720
Speaker 2:  I, am I over-hyping this thing to come in here?

901
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:02,200
Speaker 10:  No, no, I don't think you are. I think this was like a really big moment

902
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,280
Speaker 10:  for the company. I think there was a lot of enthusiasm within the company

903
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,880
Speaker 10:  with people I spoke with about it and, and people were really excited about

904
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,360
Speaker 10:  it. But it kind of is also a product of

905
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,160
Speaker 10:  Amazon and all of the, the annoyances we typically

906
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,800
Speaker 10:  have with Amazon. It not ta paying enough attention to software. It kind

907
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,960
Speaker 10:  of just shoveling things in your face and, and not making any effort to

908
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,920
Speaker 10:  improve experiences is there in this product. And it was just

909
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,600
Speaker 10:  kind of like a bomber in that respect

910
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:34,160
Speaker 2:  That seemed to be the takeaway, right? Is that like Amazon did

911
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:38,120
Speaker 2:  roughly what you would expect, which is like make a pretty

912
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,720
Speaker 2:  good e-reader. But like I, I got the sense reading your review that you,

913
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,600
Speaker 2:  you left kind of disappointed even though it's like it's a pretty good thing,

914
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,120
Speaker 2:  but it wasn't what you wanted us to be or what it could have been.

915
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:49,600
Speaker 2:  You

916
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,360
Speaker 10:  Know, I really wanted to temper my expectations coming into it because I

917
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,040
Speaker 10:  do have a very strong like feelings about Amazon as a company and how Amazon

918
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,440
Speaker 10:  has handled a lot of its products in the past. And I, I tried to like ignore

919
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,320
Speaker 10:  that when I was coming into this device and if I was gonna go get

920
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:07,360
Speaker 10:  a note-taking device for my mom tomorrow, she suddenly

921
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,960
Speaker 10:  said I want one, I probably get her this because it works well

922
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,920
Speaker 10:  enough. Okay. But it, there's a lot of other stuff out there and it

923
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,520
Speaker 10:  doesn't come anywhere close to being as good as those other products.

924
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:22,440
Speaker 10:  It's simply like it's Amazon's take on this. So it's just like,

925
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,200
Speaker 10:  did

926
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,040
Speaker 2:  It, but like gimme the, gimme the vibe of it because I imagine like, because

927
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,200
Speaker 2:  you've raved about it a bunch, I got a remarkable just to goof around with

928
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,840
Speaker 2:  and play with. And I have to say the the like feel of taking notes on that

929
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,120
Speaker 2:  thing is so much better than I expected it to be. Just the the like the way

930
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,960
Speaker 2:  it actually feels like you're writing on the screen is really incredible

931
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,840
Speaker 2:  and it seems like Amazon didn't get anywhere close to that feeling

932
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,160
Speaker 2:  like you're actually writing on a piece of paper with a pen. Right?

933
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,480
Speaker 10:  They got close enough. They got close enough, okay. With technological trade

934
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,200
Speaker 10:  offs, right? Because the remarkable two doesn't have any sort of front light

935
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,000
Speaker 10:  on it, right? So it doesn't glow at all. Generally that's fine. You're

936
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,560
Speaker 10:  probably taking your notes in a well-lit environment. But Amazon wants

937
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:04,760
Speaker 10:  it's device to be able to have those front lights so that you can also read

938
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,360
Speaker 10:  on it at night and stuff like that. And that means you're gonna have this

939
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,040
Speaker 10:  little gap between the, the pin and the actual

940
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,880
Speaker 10:  paper. And so that can be kind of frustrating. Other companies

941
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,800
Speaker 10:  like Onyx books have addressed that by making the pin move a little

942
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,560
Speaker 10:  faster. Amazon didn't really do that so there's feels like there's just

943
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:26,320
Speaker 10:  this little tiny delay and it's really noticeable versus

944
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,880
Speaker 10:  the remarkable too not as noticeable versus other e Ink

945
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,360
Speaker 10:  devices or something like the iPad.

946
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:34,920
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah it, it makes me think about like do you remember in like the early

947
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,880
Speaker 2:  days of touchscreen phones? Yes. When some of them were like very close

948
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,920
Speaker 2:  and it actually felt like you were touching the thing you were trying to

949
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,960
Speaker 2:  touch and then there were other things where it was kind of like you could

950
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,320
Speaker 2:  sense that you're like touching a piece of glass above the thing and you

951
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,040
Speaker 2:  move and then it reacts and it just like, it didn't feel like the thing on

952
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,520
Speaker 2:  the screen and the thing you were doing were connected. Is this that again?

953
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,240
Speaker 10:  Yeah, it's that exact same thing. Okay. It's not quite as bad as some of

954
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:01,200
Speaker 10:  those early phones. Like it's passable and they did a really nice job

955
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,480
Speaker 10:  with the texture of the glass and, and the nibs have like a little texture

956
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:08,000
Speaker 10:  to them like the remarkable nibs do. So you do get that, that

957
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,560
Speaker 10:  sensation of pulling it across paper. It's way better than writing

958
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:15,600
Speaker 10:  on an iPad or some Samsung tablet or Chromebook or something.

959
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,800
Speaker 2:  Nibs are very important. Alex, if you take one thing away from this Vergecast

960
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,120
Speaker 2:  episode, it's that nibs are very important and you should never, never skimp

961
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,440
Speaker 2:  on the nibs. That's the, that's the tagline

962
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:28,520
Speaker 10:  Here is the secret. If you're whatever e ink device you get to write on,

963
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,120
Speaker 10:  doesn't matter what, go get the remarkable nibs Ooh and you'll be

964
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,520
Speaker 2:  Fine. Oh that's a good call. That's a really good call. Yeah that pen is

965
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:38,760
Speaker 2:  is sick. It feels so good to write with that thing. Yeah,

966
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:42,640
Speaker 10:  I love it. I have my own stylists and I just use the remarkable

967
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,400
Speaker 10:  two nibs on it regardless of whatever e ink device I'm writing

968
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,600
Speaker 10:  on. Yeah. And it's like close enough that I'm like okay, it's fine.

969
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:53,600
Speaker 2:  No I that, yeah I totally buy that. And the thing I think that bummed me

970
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,400
Speaker 2:  out the most, it's like Amazon software is a weird thing because on the one

971
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,000
Speaker 2:  hand it's not very good in that like, like as an

972
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,440
Speaker 2:  objective piece of software it's like very slow. The everything takes forever

973
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,400
Speaker 2:  to load. It's like filtering the library stuff kind of sucks, but on the

974
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,760
Speaker 2:  other hand it's like it's fine, right? Like in, if its job is to like open

975
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,720
Speaker 2:  up a book and flip pages and find the book that I want to

976
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,520
Speaker 2:  read, like it's fine. It does the job. And for me, you and I are very different

977
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,360
Speaker 2:  in this particular respect. We're like I have been almost exclusively

978
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,920
Speaker 2:  an Amazon book reader for like over a decade. Yeah.

979
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,720
Speaker 2:  You seem to be like actively avoiding sort of throwing in your lot with Amazon

980
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,360
Speaker 2:  as much as you can over time. Whereas I just gave up a while ago and I'm

981
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,200
Speaker 2:  like, all of my books come from Amazon. It sucks. I have a lot of feelings

982
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,640
Speaker 2:  about Amazon as a company and it's relationship with publishers and what

983
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,160
Speaker 2:  it's done to books. But like this is what it is. I own hundreds of Kindle

984
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:42,800
Speaker 2:  books. I

985
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,560
Speaker 10:  Mean I still own a ton of Kindle books. Like, like

986
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,880
Speaker 10:  I have bought so many books on the Kindle over the year. I like

987
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:53,400
Speaker 10:  reading on it but over time I just got kind of fed up with

988
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,360
Speaker 10:  particularly library integration. I didn't have any real clean library integration

989
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:01,520
Speaker 10:  and it was a bummer. And then like I enjoy, I enjoy Fanfic,

990
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:05,640
Speaker 10:  I'm, I'm an adult who who likes to read about fictional characters like

991
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,320
Speaker 10:  their dolls in a playhouse. So I, that

992
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,920
Speaker 10:  does not work at all for that. And that's kind of what led me to get away

993
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,880
Speaker 10:  from it as much as like Amazon ru the day was like there

994
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,120
Speaker 10:  were needs that the Kindle just doesn't meet. And that's because the Kindle's

995
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,600
Speaker 10:  job is to sell you Kindle books and keep you in the Kindle

996
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,480
Speaker 10:  ecosystem. It has no interest and that's fine. I totally get that.

997
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,120
Speaker 10:  I'm not gonna like knock on them for that element

998
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:35,240
Speaker 10:  of it. But the experience, even if you are in the Kindle universe

999
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,520
Speaker 10:  isn't super great anymore.

1000
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:40,040
Speaker 2:  I mean let's not forget though that this is the same company that you buy

1001
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,800
Speaker 2:  something from and then it advertises that same thing to you all

1002
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,600
Speaker 2:  across the internet for the next like several years. So like I

1003
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,560
Speaker 2:  agree with you that it's stupid but I am also in no way surprised that Amazon

1004
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,920
Speaker 2:  is not good at this. And I

1005
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,920
Speaker 10:  Think that's what bummed me out the most is that this felt like a big

1006
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:00,280
Speaker 10:  change for Amazon. It felt like this big turn but it's just a big turn

1007
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,120
Speaker 10:  for the hardware division, right? Every other element

1008
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,800
Speaker 10:  of Amazon is still Amazon, the software is still Amazon, how it's

1009
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,480
Speaker 10:  marketed is still Amazon. Like, and I get it, you can't turn a huge company

1010
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,880
Speaker 10:  like that and redirect them to improve things. It's gonna take a lot more

1011
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,480
Speaker 10:  work than one kind of crummy e ink tablet

1012
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,320
Speaker 10:  release. But it's still like just is such a

1013
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,960
Speaker 10:  bummer cuz it's like okay this is it. Like if I wanna

1014
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:29,720
Speaker 10:  be using the best of the best in America, this is what I got.

1015
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,640
Speaker 10:  Right. You know like with phones, I've got an I like the iPhone is great.

1016
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:37,600
Speaker 10:  Is there a lot of frustration with its walled garden? Absolutely. But it's

1017
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,560
Speaker 10:  still like good software. It's still good hardware and this is

1018
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,680
Speaker 10:  like good hardware, terrifically bad software.

1019
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:47,000
Speaker 2:  Yeah and I mean it goes back to the same stuff we were talking about, right?

1020
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,320
Speaker 2:  Like it was interesting like reading the stuff even that you compared it

1021
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,200
Speaker 2:  to in your review because there's like, like you said, there's the Onyx book

1022
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,120
Speaker 2:  stuff, there's the remarkable stuff and there's a lot of things that you

1023
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:01,080
Speaker 2:  kind of slightly sort of overlapping things

1024
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,400
Speaker 2:  with. Yeah. The Kindle scribe, right? Where it's like if you want an EIN

1025
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,720
Speaker 2:  tablet, this is not the one to buy, right? Like if you, if you want to do

1026
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:11,560
Speaker 2:  lots of things on an EIN tablet and if that phrase even like means anything

1027
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,080
Speaker 2:  to you, do not buy the Kindle scribe.

1028
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:13,960
Speaker 10:  Yeah, don't

1029
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:17,720
Speaker 2:  Buy. No. And if you're like a lawyer who wants to read PDFs all day,

1030
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,320
Speaker 2:  like buy the remarkable because that thing kicks ass. It's really expensive.

1031
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,920
Speaker 2:  But for that specific purpose, like it rules and I cannot recommend it hard

1032
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,320
Speaker 2:  enough for that specific purpose. But for Amazon there's nobody doing this

1033
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,640
Speaker 2:  thing that Amazon is trying to do. Like this is where I want like Cobo to

1034
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,840
Speaker 2:  make something awesome or like Barnes and Noble to make something awesome

1035
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,160
Speaker 2:  and it's just like no one has. And so if it's like I'm just like a regular

1036
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,160
Speaker 2:  person who reads books and I wanna be able to like take notes and sync them

1037
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,920
Speaker 2:  to the cloud and find them later. Like there just isn't any competition.

1038
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:43,600
Speaker 2:  There's just none.

1039
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:46,920
Speaker 10:  Yeah. There, there's no competition. I mean Cobo has definitely done like

1040
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,280
Speaker 10:  kind of note taking. They've, they've released a couple of devices I think

1041
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,760
Speaker 10:  that have a stylist and everything. But Cobo I also think they're hardware

1042
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,520
Speaker 10:  feels really cheap and like yeah, plasticy and annoying and like I feel

1043
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,320
Speaker 10:  like a baby when I hold it. And so the K, the Kindle scribe

1044
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,400
Speaker 10:  feels gorgeous in your hands and everything and then you're like, okay,

1045
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,160
Speaker 10:  I wanna take notes. Okay so I have five pin weights that I can choose from.

1046
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:12,200
Speaker 10:  I can't do pencil at all, which like feels like just easy

1047
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:15,680
Speaker 10:  and then like, okay I wanna sync whatever documents I have

1048
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:20,000
Speaker 10:  and I have to email them to myself and then it emails me

1049
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,600
Speaker 10:  a link to my pdf which that that link that you get,

1050
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:27,720
Speaker 10:  if anybody else has that link, they also get your pdf. So if you're like

1051
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,600
Speaker 10:  a lawyer, you cannot use the Kindle scribe because you're just creating

1052
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,000
Speaker 10:  a security nightmare for yourself. And that's like you've got the biggest

1053
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,600
Speaker 10:  cloud computing company in the world in the same building as you.

1054
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:43,040
Speaker 10:  Why didn't, did no one make an effort to try to integrate this better?

1055
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:47,040
Speaker 2:  Nothing makes me crazier than how difficult it is to say like I have a thing

1056
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,040
Speaker 2:  on my computer and I would like it to be on my Kindle. There's like a bookmark

1057
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,560
Speaker 2:  that they have where you can send web stuff to Kindle or like

1058
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,480
Speaker 10:  And it works like reasonably well. Yes.

1059
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's like I give it like a, like a c plus for like it, it usually

1060
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,960
Speaker 2:  gets all the words on the page and puts them on my Kindle. But does it look

1061
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,920
Speaker 2:  insane? Yes.

1062
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,800
Speaker 10:  Yeah. If you're using like New York Times, you know like if, if you're

1063
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,520
Speaker 10:  using like a very well like everybody reads it

1064
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:15,880
Speaker 10:  source, it's gonna transfer it fine. If you're like, I found this weird

1065
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,480
Speaker 10:  ass blog and I wanna read it later from this guy who have never heard of

1066
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,520
Speaker 10:  it's gonna look like garbage on your Kindle scribe.

1067
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:25,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All your like sick Tumblr fan fiction is not going to

1068
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,800
Speaker 2:  appear correctly on the Kindle scribe

1069
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:30,880
Speaker 10:  Not looking good. Yeah, I'm gonna be crying. It's fine. I've I've

1070
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,360
Speaker 10:  worked through it. That's why I've got the other, the other rereading devices.

1071
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:33,680
Speaker 10:  Yeah,

1072
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,480
Speaker 2:  That's fair. So okay, last thing and then, and we will, we will leave this

1073
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,240
Speaker 2:  alone for now. My sense is most people's question is do I

1074
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,160
Speaker 2:  buy the Kindle scribe or do I buy a different Kindle? Like I feel like ultimately

1075
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,000
Speaker 2:  I want there to be more interesting competition in this space but it's kind

1076
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,640
Speaker 2:  of not right? It's like, it's like the iPhone question, right? Like people

1077
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,040
Speaker 2:  who have iPhones are gonna keep buying iPhones. Do I buy the pro or the regular

1078
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,840
Speaker 2:  one? Like this feels like that same question to me.

1079
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,320
Speaker 10:  Yeah. So like if you're a person with not great vision, I say as somebody

1080
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,280
Speaker 10:  with not great vision, the Kindle scribe makes a lot of sense, right? Like

1081
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:05,280
Speaker 10:  it's really gorgeous device. It, it just works like a Kindle but

1082
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,320
Speaker 10:  it's big And so I think that makes sense for a lot of people and I think

1083
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,200
Speaker 10:  there are a lot of people that want that bigger device. I personally like

1084
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,400
Speaker 10:  a smaller device, I think like seven Inches kind of my platonic ideal for

1085
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:14,600
Speaker 10:  reading.

1086
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:18,120
Speaker 2:  Can you still kind of hold it in one hand and read it it in bed? Cuz that's

1087
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,840
Speaker 2:  like for me that's the thing like sometimes I like the two hand but I also

1088
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,200
Speaker 2:  need to be able to like lie in bed and hold it above my face and still be

1089
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:24,600
Speaker 2:  able to read.

1090
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:28,840
Speaker 10:  You can, but I'll admit you won't be able to do this David.

1091
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:32,520
Speaker 10:  But I definitely read it in bed but like use my boobs as like a stand.

1092
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:37,280
Speaker 10:  If you don't have boobs that's gonna be harder for you. But a lot of people

1093
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,440
Speaker 10:  are listening to this being like, oh my god, that's how I use my iPad. But

1094
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,440
Speaker 10:  for everybody else, I'm sorry. Yeah, it like it's, it's very easy to hold

1095
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,920
Speaker 10:  with one hand. It's very easy to walk around. Like sometimes you do feel

1096
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,360
Speaker 10:  like you're in Star Trek and you're like hold on, let me use my pet, send

1097
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:52,320
Speaker 10:  something to Picard cuz it's just like this big device.

1098
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,880
Speaker 2:  It's badass. Yeah but

1099
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,840
Speaker 10:  It works fine And I think if you just want a nice Kindle you wanna spend

1100
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,560
Speaker 10:  the money cause it's expensive. It starts at like $330. Yeah it

1101
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:01,840
Speaker 10:  works.

1102
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:05,680
Speaker 2:  I kind of came away from it thinking I'll probably buy a scribe too.

1103
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:09,720
Speaker 2:  And for now I like my Kindle fine. I, I would like to have one

1104
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,120
Speaker 2:  with more note ticking stuff but like I can live with the keyboard typing

1105
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,720
Speaker 2:  notes for a little longer and it, this does feel like the kind of thing that

1106
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:19,840
Speaker 2:  a year from now with a little little bit of software work and maybe

1107
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,560
Speaker 2:  this is wishful thinking because we've been waiting 15 years for Amazon to

1108
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,880
Speaker 2:  have good software and here we are. But like a little bit more work, a little

1109
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,680
Speaker 2:  bit more fine tuning. Especially with like the pen and the display. And it

1110
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:32,400
Speaker 2:  feels like this is the kind of thing where like V2 has potential to be like

1111
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,640
Speaker 2:  a lot better in all of these sort of small ways that you're talking about.

1112
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,640
Speaker 2:  Is that a crazy takeaway?

1113
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:40,160
Speaker 10:  No, I don't think that's crazy. Even in my conversations with people at

1114
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:44,000
Speaker 10:  Amazon, like after I'd been reviewing this thing for a while and I was

1115
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,640
Speaker 10:  kind of like, hey here are some of my issues with it. They're like, these

1116
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,080
Speaker 10:  are very good things to know and like pass on to the engineers. I think

1117
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:54,600
Speaker 10:  there is a lot of like appetite there to improve on these

1118
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,960
Speaker 10:  devices. I just don't know. I don't know how confident I can be that they

1119
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,920
Speaker 10:  will do it because it's a huge company. It's hard to get

1120
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,680
Speaker 10:  everybody onto a project and get them like reorient everyone. And I think

1121
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,120
Speaker 10:  there's a lot that needs to happen to make this a really great experience

1122
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,840
Speaker 10:  instead of like, eh, I get my books, it's fine. Yeah, the Kindle scribe

1123
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,800
Speaker 10:  too will definitely be better.

1124
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,880
Speaker 2:  This is why I root so hard for Cobo. Like I just root for Cobo. Not because

1125
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,920
Speaker 2:  I want Cobos but because I want somebody at Amazon to be like, whoa, that

1126
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,880
Speaker 2:  Cobo is good. And then feel like they have to go make better things. Yeah,

1127
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,560
Speaker 2:  that's like competition people. This is all I want in the world. Even though

1128
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,280
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna keep buying Kindles like, I'm sorry Cobo, I have too many Kindle

1129
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,480
Speaker 2:  books. I can't buy Cobos. I literally, it's illegal for me to buy Cobos.

1130
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:36,000
Speaker 2:  I own too many Amazon books, but I want them to be good so that Amazon will

1131
