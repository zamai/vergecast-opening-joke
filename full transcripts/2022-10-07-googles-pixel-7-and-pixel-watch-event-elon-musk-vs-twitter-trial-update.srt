Speaker 2:  Hello and welcome to Road Cast, the flagship podcast of Chris

7
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,070
Speaker 2:  Pratt's. Mario Voice, which was a lie.

8
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,990
Speaker 5:  Just a, it's just a normal podcast. Just a regular podcast.

9
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,230
Speaker 2:  It's a regular old podcast.

10
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,710
Speaker 2:  So you don't know this cuz you're listening later you're, you know, time.

11
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,630
Speaker 2:  The magic of time shifting this, covering this up. You're in your

12
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,430
Speaker 2:  car, you're going about your day. We are starting late. Me

13
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,790
Speaker 2:  your friend Eli David Pierce. Hi Alex Kranz.

14
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,470
Speaker 6:  Hi.

15
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,270
Speaker 2:  We are starting late because we were waiting for the

16
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,110
Speaker 2:  Nintendo direct reveal of Chris Pratt's voice in the New Mario

17
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,790
Speaker 2:  movie. And it's just his voice.

18
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,910
Speaker 5:  It's just Chris Pratt.

19
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,870
Speaker 6:  No. Bob Hoskins impression. No potentially

20
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,150
Speaker 6:  offensive impression. Just, just Chris Pratt.

21
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,590
Speaker 2:  I mean he said it will be unlike anything you've ever heard. Right.

22
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,870
Speaker 5:  Parentheses, if you've never heard Chris Pratt before, I mean

23
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,390
Speaker 6:  A lot of people haven't watched Parks and Rec, they haven't seen

24
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,150
Speaker 6:  ever would I get it

25
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,590
Speaker 2:  Right. But your choices are like the entertainingly but

26
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,710
Speaker 2:  somewhat racist. It's a me mark. You

27
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,190
Speaker 5:  Know, he was gonna say every other option was worse.

28
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,200
Speaker 5:  So like, in a way, this is the least

29
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,880
Speaker 2:  One.

30
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,800
Speaker 6:  Bob Hoskins. Bob Hoskins does. Bob Hoskins just went

31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,920
Speaker 6:  out there and he was like, I'm in this movie, I'm playing Mario.

32
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,040
Speaker 2:  Yeah. He was just mad by the way you would keep talking Bob Hoskins.

33
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,920
Speaker 2:  I'm pretty sure most of our listeners have not seen the Super Mario

34
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,080
Speaker 2:  Brothers movie starting

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,000
Speaker 6:  Bob Hoskin classic starring him

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,480
Speaker 6:  and John Lake Zamo shot in

37
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,560
Speaker 2:  Brooklyn. It was not good. Like that movie came out when I was a child

38
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,760
Speaker 2:  who was playing Super Mario Brothers. And I was like, now I'm gonna give

39
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,320
Speaker 2:  this one a mess.

40
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,240
Speaker 6:  Oh, I loved it. It was like a transformative moment for me. I tried

41
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,320
Speaker 6:  to do my hair like Coupa

42
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,000
Speaker 2:  Bob Hoskins, I think he, he played it as I'm an actual plumber.

43
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah, right. He was like, what's wrong with these guys? Your turtles? Like,

44
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,840
Speaker 2:  he was like a very strange voice. And then obviously

45
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,560
Speaker 2:  there's like the famous sort of like modern day Mario

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,000
Speaker 2:  voice. Well,

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,160
Speaker 5:  Who?

48
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,560
Speaker 2:  Which again, it seems fine. Like we've, we've all

49
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,520
Speaker 2:  come up with it. I, my assumption is that if Chris Pratt had done

50
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Speaker 2:  that voice, he wouldn't be immediately canceled

51
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,080
Speaker 2:  by like regular Italians and Italian Americans. They

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,120
Speaker 2:  would've just been like, You're done

53
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,000
Speaker 6:  Not doing

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,240
Speaker 2:  This. And so he was like, I'm gonna do this other voice. You've never heard

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,640
Speaker 2:  it before. It's like unlike. And so we all waited with baited breath. He

56
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,360
Speaker 2:  only said one line that was like, what is this place? But it was just Chris

57
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,800
Speaker 2:  Pratt.

58
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,320
Speaker 2:  Anyway, so we're starting late today and I gotta tell you, I think we're

59
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,280
Speaker 2:  all starting from a place of profound anger at CRISPR for lying to us.

60
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I had high

61
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,200
Speaker 2:  Hopes, but that's not, Wait we look Well maybe there's more movie. Maybe

62
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,520
Speaker 2:  he's gonna grow into the voice over the course of the movie. Yeah, that's

63
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Speaker 2:  a thing you can do. Maybe

64
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,600
Speaker 5:  It's a trilogy and by the end it'll be full Mario.

65
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,440
Speaker 6:  So like at the end of the movie Bowser's gonna be like, who are you?

66
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,280
Speaker 6:  And he's just gonna be like, it's a me

67
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,400
Speaker 5:  Slam to credits

68
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,720
Speaker 2:  The hardest. It's a me Mario ever delivered

69
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,360
Speaker 6:  So hard. Deadly serious.

70
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,640
Speaker 2:  The movie looks very silly. What we, when we started watching the trailer,

71
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,840
Speaker 2:  Alex just went, Oh this movie's for children.

72
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,280
Speaker 5:  Yep.

73
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,800
Speaker 6:  We're too old.

74
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,920
Speaker 2:  There was a little bit of like the sort of thing they do in all trailers

75
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,720
Speaker 2:  now where there's like the minor key theme comes up. Yeah. To make like

76
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,440
Speaker 2:  Dark Mariot. But then it was just a Mario movie. Anyway, go watch the trailer.

77
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,840
Speaker 2:  You could watch it right now. Pull your car over, see if you are as disappointed

78
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,160
Speaker 2:  as we were.

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
Speaker 5:  I'm already for the the gritty reboot starting Tom Holland. I'm ready for

80
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,040
Speaker 5:  it. It's gonna be amazing. That

81
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,400
Speaker 6:  Was the Bob Hoskins movie.

82
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,560
Speaker 2:  It

83
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,240
Speaker 6:  Was the gritty

84
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,080
Speaker 2:  Movie. It really was. They were like, what if Mario and Louise

85
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,640
Speaker 2:  were actually plumbers in this situation and they played it

86
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,680
Speaker 6:  Future where everyone's a human dinosaur.

87
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,680
Speaker 2:  Perfect. Oh yeah, that was the, I mean that's movie. Can I wanna say it?

88
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,080
Speaker 2:  I can't believe you remember this movie, so, Oh my God. All right. That's

89
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,760
Speaker 2:  not the news. We thought it was gonna be the news. What? What were we thinking?

90
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,880
Speaker 2:  The news? I mean it's a big news week. Yeah, there was a

91
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,480
Speaker 2:  Google event today. David was there along with V and Welch

92
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,800
Speaker 2:  and Allison. We got New Pixel seven new Pixel seven Pro. We

93
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,440
Speaker 2:  saw the Pixel watch, we saw a tease with a Pixel tablet.

94
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,040
Speaker 2:  Elon is just eling like a maniac in the Delaware

95
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,840
Speaker 2:  court system. The European governments are like, Yeah, usbc

96
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,680
Speaker 2:  remember that you're gonna use it now. Apple Allison reviewed the iPhone

97
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,160
Speaker 2:  14 plus, which still has a Lightning connect. Just a lot going on. So I think

98
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,480
Speaker 2:  the way we're gonna break this down, we should start with Google and Pixel

99
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,120
Speaker 2:  and then we're gonna have Liz join us and talk about Elon. Right? Yeah. Sounds

100
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,280
Speaker 2:  like a plan. We should do it. That feels like the right plan. Let's start

101
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,440
Speaker 2:  with a Google event. David, you were there with a full crew live logged it,

102
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,280
Speaker 2:  the whole thing, what's going on?

103
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,600
Speaker 5:  So this event was weird because Google back

104
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,440
Speaker 5:  in June at IO just was like, here's all the stuff we're gonna

105
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,880
Speaker 5:  launch in September. And then just told us about all the things like we have

106
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,520
Speaker 5:  a Pixel seven and we have a Pixel seven Pro and we have a Pixel watch. And

107
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,760
Speaker 5:  we were like, Tell us more. And they were like later no problems. But, so

108
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,640
Speaker 5:  we get there today and it's at this place in Brooklyn called

109
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,920
Speaker 5:  National Saw Dust, which is I guess like a music venue, I don't know, used

110
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,360
Speaker 5:  to live near there. Did you ever go to National Saw Dust? Yeah, it's

111
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,320
Speaker 2:  A place, It's cute. It's in Williamsburg. It's nice.

112
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,280
Speaker 5:  But it was like we're used to these things being sort of big spectacles.

113
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,000
Speaker 5:  This one was very intimate. I like, it was basically four rows

114
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,640
Speaker 5:  of these chairs, probably 60 people. It was like all journalists. And

115
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,640
Speaker 5:  I was like eight feet from Rick Olo as he's like introducing all these new

116
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,560
Speaker 5:  gadgets. It was nice to be in person again. Yeah, like we Eli,

117
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,720
Speaker 5:  you and I have done a couple of these now where like a lot of people get

118
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,520
Speaker 5:  together and we all watch a video. This was not that, which was nice. But

119
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,360
Speaker 5:  yeah, they launched the Pixel seven. The Pixel seven Pro Pixel watch. They

120
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,800
Speaker 5:  told us a little bit about the Pixel tablet, which is coming next year and

121
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,960
Speaker 5:  I think is actually like sneaky. Very interesting. And then basically made

122
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,920
Speaker 5:  the like grand case for Google Gadgets, right? This like, they've talked

123
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,800
Speaker 5:  a lot about ambient computing, they've talked a lot about like putting all

124
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,080
Speaker 5:  the pieces together. They started the whole thing with basically a long,

125
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,560
Speaker 5:  I think ne you were the one who called it the, the corporate webinar about

126
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
Speaker 5:  product design. Yes.

127
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,160
Speaker 2:  It was a product design and And and privacy and safety. Right. And

128
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,600
Speaker 2:  it just, if you've ever had to take a corporate training before in your life

129
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,920
Speaker 2:  where like at the end there's gonna be a short quiz. Yeah.

130
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,480
Speaker 2:  Very much that vibe.

131
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah, no, I think that that

132
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,880
Speaker 2:  Track but just, I was like, I don't, I I don't wanna remember what kind of

133
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,760
Speaker 2:  aluminum you use. I refuse. In fact sir. Yeah.

134
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,280
Speaker 5:  But yeah, they gave us the whole rundown and then we went down the street

135
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,160
Speaker 5:  to I think, what is the newest Google store that they said just opened

136
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,880
Speaker 5:  this summer and got to actually see the things and I don't know how y'all

137
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,800
Speaker 5:  felt sort of watching it, but being there, it was like the watch was by

138
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,120
Speaker 5:  a mile the most interesting thing that happened today. And the phones were

139
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,040
Speaker 5:  phones and we should talk about them, but like their phones and if you just

140
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,040
Speaker 5:  like imagine a Pixel seven in your head, you're correct. That's what it is.

141
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,720
Speaker 5:  And then everybody went around looking for this, but the tablet wasn't there.

142
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,920
Speaker 5:  But the best part about it was there were a bunch of Nest hub maxes there

143
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,120
Speaker 5:  and I was one of probably 50 people who walked up to one and tried to pull

144
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,080
Speaker 5:  the two pieces apart to see if it was a tablet. And

145
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
Speaker 5:  it wasn't. It's a a

146
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,360
Speaker 5:  but it was interesting. And I will say I think the watch to me is, is

147
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,560
Speaker 5:  both better seeming from the experience we've had of it so far and just like

148
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,160
Speaker 5:  way more interesting than anything else that came out to Gabe. Was that y'all's

149
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,480
Speaker 5:  experience too? Yes. Or do you think Yes,

150
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,800
Speaker 2:  Yes and no. Oh, I mean I, I, I mean, yes in the

151
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,720
Speaker 2:  sense that like it's the new product category. David E did a

152
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,200
Speaker 2:  big feature with Rick and some other Google folks about it. People should

153
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,920
Speaker 2:  go read it. It's interesting. My no is like,

154
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,800
Speaker 2:  all I can think for better or worse is when will Google

155
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,760
Speaker 2:  stop caring about it? Yes. Right. Which is kind of the thrust of your feature.

156
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,440
Speaker 2:  And like Google it's, it's Google. Like they have

157
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,280
Speaker 2:  created this problem for themselves where I just

158
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,880
Speaker 2:  need to believe them. Right. And I'm actually more, and so like if I just

159
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,640
Speaker 2:  had to rank them, I would say like the Pixel tablet to me, which isn't even

160
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,440
Speaker 2:  out yet and is like kind of paperwork. Cause the ship date is just 2023.

161
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,320
Speaker 2:  Like I know they're committed to Nest hubs. I know how I use

162
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,880
Speaker 2:  the one in my house. I've watched it get software updates. Yep. I know that

163
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,400
Speaker 2:  the CEO of Google Cares a lot about Google Assistant and Chrome.

164
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And like I want that product to run Google Assistant and Chrome on

165
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,760
Speaker 2:  it. So like I know it's gonna ship and it's gonna do those things

166
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,160
Speaker 2:  really well. And the watch is like it'll ship and you'll get it

167
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,280
Speaker 2:  and then maybe two years from now they're just gonna shut it down. And like,

168
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,080
Speaker 2:  I, I don't know, I I just dunno how to quantify that. So it's true. Like

169
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,600
Speaker 2:  it is the most interesting thing cuz it's a new category for them. A new

170
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,760
Speaker 2:  kind of hardware, a bunch of new capabilities, a new thesis.

171
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,200
Speaker 2:  But you know, there's just a dark cloud around new Google things now.

172
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:31,640
Speaker 2:  So

173
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,240
Speaker 6:  You're worry about commitment isn't for the phones, it's for the other products.

174
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,640
Speaker 6:  Like the tablet and the watch.

175
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,680
Speaker 2:  I know why they have to make the phones. Yeah. Every year it's obvious. Yep.

176
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,160
Speaker 2:  Because they need something to scare Samsung with. Right, right. There's,

177
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,360
Speaker 2:  if they let go of that, they might as well just like give Android to Samsung

178
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,920
Speaker 2:  and be done with it. Yeah. So they like, there's like a reason for that thing

179
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,520
Speaker 2:  to exist. There's a reason for their smart home efforts to exist.

180
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,400
Speaker 2:  Right. And you can make some case for the watch to exist. Right. If you

181
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,240
Speaker 2:  don't have this category, Apple's just gonna eat you at the watch. And then

182
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,880
Speaker 2:  the, you know, like there's a whole sort of like meandering road.

183
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,480
Speaker 5:  Yes. Yeah. But it's a weird one because on the one hand I think you could

184
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,720
Speaker 5:  make the case, and this was the fun thing about writing this story and talking

185
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,120
Speaker 5:  to Rick and a bunch of folks on the team. Like you could make the case that

186
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,360
Speaker 5:  the watch is actually like crucially important to all of the things that

187
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,800
Speaker 5:  Google wants to do because it's on your body, because it has biometrics,

188
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,120
Speaker 5:  because it like understands you. It's like all the stuff that they wanna

189
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,120
Speaker 5:  do actually might require a thing that lives on your body. Right? Yeah.

190
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,520
Speaker 5:  So like I can see that. But it's also, to your point by far, the easiest

191
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,480
Speaker 5:  one to walk away from right now. And Google has a really long history

192
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,320
Speaker 5:  of walking away from these things. Like literally, I, I had, I had two

193
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,880
Speaker 5:  calls with Google two days apart. It was like a whatever, like a Tuesday

194
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,200
Speaker 5:  and a Thursday and on the in between day Google killed Stadia.

195
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,440
Speaker 5:  And so it's just like, okay, this is, and I

196
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,080
Speaker 5:  literally, I I opened both of those calls with like, why on Earth should

197
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,200
Speaker 5:  I believe you that you're serious about doing this? And basically their answer

198
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,760
Speaker 5:  is like, all we can do is prove it to you. Right? Like people ask us this

199
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,560
Speaker 5:  question about the pixel phones and we kept making the pixel phones and now

200
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,840
Speaker 5:  people don't ask us this question anymore. And like I look forward to five

201
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,720
Speaker 5:  years from now when I can say the same thing about a watch. And I was like,

202
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,560
Speaker 5:  that's all well and good, but like you're asking me for $350

203
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,280
Speaker 5:  today. Yeah. And that is, that's a very different thing. The watch looks

204
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,360
Speaker 5:  really nice. I will say like Alex, we, we have a couple of them around like

205
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,200
Speaker 5:  Alex and I have both been playing with them and it's got the round face.

206
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,000
Speaker 5:  It's not huge. The interface has made huge strides. Yeah. It's much better

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,600
Speaker 5:  to use than any Android smart watch I've ever used. It's

208
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,520
Speaker 6:  Definitely feels like it's probably gonna be one of, if not the best Andrew

209
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,200
Speaker 6:  smartwatch.

210
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,120
Speaker 5:  I think so too. And it also, v and I were talking about this earlier, like

211
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,960
Speaker 5:  it basically just decimate Fitbit forever. Like Fitbit

212
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,760
Speaker 5:  as a, as a thing that exists outside of Pixel products is dead. Like

213
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,280
Speaker 5:  there's just no reason to buy a Pixel or a Fitbit that isn't baked into the

214
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,040
Speaker 5:  Pixel watch. Well,

215
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,720
Speaker 2:  Unless you have an iPhone.

216
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,640
Speaker 5:  Right. That's I'm fair there is that, which is, it turns out

217
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,080
Speaker 5:  quite a large number of people, but No, but I think you're right and, and

218
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,000
Speaker 5:  there's just, Google has to like prove this weird thing that all evidence

219
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,520
Speaker 5:  is against Google, which even with smartwatches, like Google has been making

220
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,960
Speaker 5:  smartwatch software for a long time and intermittently seems to care about

221
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,720
Speaker 5:  it and then forget about it and then care about it and then forget about

222
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,560
Speaker 5:  it. I can see they're four years in now to caring

223
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,880
Speaker 5:  about it and that's a reasonably long time. But like what I bet on Google

224
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,880
Speaker 5:  continuing to make smart watches on without stopping for the next 10 years.

225
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Speaker 5:  Like absolutely not.

226
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,680
Speaker 6:  I wonder how frustrating it is though for people who aren't like us. Like

227
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,400
Speaker 6:  I think every single one of us has sat in at least three calls where Google

228
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Speaker 6:  says this is the time we care about smart watches. Yeah.

229
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,880
Speaker 5:  We're so serious.

230
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,160
Speaker 6:  We are so serious. And most people haven't had to sit through that. Most

231
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,800
Speaker 6:  people don't know that the LG style came out and was terrible.

232
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,840
Speaker 6:  Most people don't know about all those other times or they haven't cared.

233
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,720
Speaker 6:  So like I wonder if that fatigue is unique to us or if that's

234
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,680
Speaker 6:  a bigger thing. I

235
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,320
Speaker 5:  Think that's a fair point. But the, the part that kept jumping out to me

236
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,520
Speaker 5:  was there was this whole section in talking about the pixel phones,

237
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,000
Speaker 5:  I think it was Brian Markowski, one of the Google execs who's in charge of

238
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,480
Speaker 5:  all the Pixel stuff who was talking about how part of the Pixel promise

239
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,920
Speaker 5:  is that it gets better over time, right? Like they do the, they do the drops

240
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,520
Speaker 5:  and their whole thing is like, we have this very powerful processor with

241
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,880
Speaker 5:  a lot of machine learning and we can do all this stuff. And so we're actually

242
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,000
Speaker 5:  in position for your phone to get better over time as the AI work that we

243
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,120
Speaker 5:  do continues to improve. And it's like that's all well and good and there's

244
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,680
Speaker 5:  actually some truth to that. Like the Pixel software has gotten substantially

245
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,880
Speaker 5:  better over the years. It only works if you keep doing

246
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,800
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And

247
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,560
Speaker 5:  Like the Pixel Watch bio accounts has a bunch of stuff going for it, but

248
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,200
Speaker 5:  it's like in no way a finished product and Google has these big ambitions

249
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,120
Speaker 5:  and it's like, you know, it's like a thing we always say never buy a thing

250
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,840
Speaker 5:  based on what it might be someday. Yeah. And Google is making these big promises

251
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,360
Speaker 5:  about where they'll go someday. And I, I just think you, you'd sort of be

252
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,000
Speaker 5:  crazy to believe them even if they're telling the truth or they think they

253
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,160
Speaker 5:  are.

254
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,920
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean the evaluating something on potential of future software

255
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,360
Speaker 2:  updates is like, I'm old now and I'm just gonna tell you it's a suckers game.

256
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,000
Speaker 2:  Yes. You shouldn't do it. But the, you know, this was true of like

257
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,400
Speaker 2:  Amazon last week too, right? Amazon has just sort of like

258
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,360
Speaker 2:  relentlessly iterated on Alexa, but it has reached its final form. Yeah.

259
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,080
Speaker 2:  And like there's not much more they can say Alexa can do. Right. And so now

260
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,360
Speaker 2:  they just like put it into like Alexa can fly now

261
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,640
Speaker 2:  it's like literally a product is like a flying ring camera with l like

262
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,680
Speaker 2:  fine. And I just think phones are that thing and watches are not that

263
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,840
Speaker 2:  thing yet. Yeah. We don't know where watches are going to go and Google's

264
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,280
Speaker 2:  just starting well behind Apple. Right. So we should talk about the watch

265
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,920
Speaker 2:  as it is and what the promises are today, what it can do. But then it's the

266
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,680
Speaker 2:  question of, as you were saying David, the the question is like, it might

267
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,640
Speaker 2:  be central to their whole strategy and it's like worth understanding what

268
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,240
Speaker 2:  that whole strategy even could be for this thing. Even though it's like obvious

269
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,040
Speaker 2:  it's not this one and that, Right? Like they're gonna make a Pixel Watch

270
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,600
Speaker 2:  two and a Pixel Watch three and a Pixel Watch four. And maybe by then we

271
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,800
Speaker 2:  will believe them that they're committed to the product and we'll like live

272
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,600
Speaker 2:  up to more of their ideals. Right. Right now, just from watching it,

273
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,520
Speaker 2:  it seems like it's round, it's cool, it's a little bit smaller than

274
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,680
Speaker 2:  Apple watches. It's got a bunch of cool Fitbit stuff in it and it's where

275
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,760
Speaker 2:  os and that is, it is, am I missing something? No,

276
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,480
Speaker 5:  That's pretty much, that's pretty much the extent of it. I mean e even the

277
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,200
Speaker 5:  fact that they had James Park who was formerly the CEO

278
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,720
Speaker 5:  of Fitbit before they were bought by Google do the presentation for the Pixel

279
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,560
Speaker 5:  watch I thought was deeply fascinating. Yeah. Like, like Google and I wrote

280
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,360
Speaker 5:  about this bunch in the story, but like Google has these big ideas about

281
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,800
Speaker 5:  like risk computers, right? And it's like this thing should be contextual

282
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,640
Speaker 5:  and it should understand you and it should interact with your other devices.

283
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,160
Speaker 5:  Like they made a Fitbit, like make no mistake. Like the Pixel Watch is a

284
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,800
Speaker 5:  Fitbit that also runs Google Maps. Like that is functionally what this thing

285
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,120
Speaker 5:  is. But we

286
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,720
Speaker 6:  Should, we should note a very good looking Fitbit.

287
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,480
Speaker 5:  It is, it's, it's nice looking and by all extent or by all accounts very

288
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,040
Speaker 5:  powerful.

289
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,520
Speaker 6:  Like, and Fitbit was terrible at making good looking smart watches. Yes.

290
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,920
Speaker 6:  Like the worst at

291
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,440
Speaker 5:  It. Yes. There was a

292
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,760
Speaker 2:  How's the bezel? This is what I mean, honestly, we we're 16 minutes into

293
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,360
Speaker 2:  this and now I'm asking about the bezel. I've not done my job. How's the

294
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,920
Speaker 2:  bezzle? It's,

295
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,640
Speaker 5:  This question is so hard to answer. Alex can vouch for this. So it's a weird

296
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,840
Speaker 5:  thing where like the Bele is large. Yeah. It, it just is large,

297
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,120
Speaker 5:  but the way they've designed the UI is such that you don't actually notice

298
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
Speaker 5:  the bele most of the time. It's

299
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,600
Speaker 6:  Like the bele on on earlier Apple watches where like there's a

300
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,960
Speaker 6:  bezel and, and you sometimes bump up against it and I think you are gonna

301
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,360
Speaker 6:  bump up against it a lot more in this watch than on an Apple watch. But you

302
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,200
Speaker 6:  don't really notice it that often. You're not like ah, a lot. Whereas previous

303
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,120
Speaker 6:  round watches you'd put it on and be like, Yep, it's a big old bezel

304
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,240
Speaker 6:  on.

305
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,040
Speaker 5:  Totally. Or it had that flat tire at the bottom. Yeah. Like the, the Moto

306
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,880
Speaker 5:  watches did. Like, it doesn't feel like any of that. It feels like it's all

307
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,560
Speaker 5:  screen. Except if for anybody who hasn't watched the keynote, I encourage

308
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,200
Speaker 5:  you to go back to the keynote and look for the moment where they're testing,

309
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,320
Speaker 5:  they're showing off that you can take a photo using the watches

310
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,200
Speaker 5:  of View Finder and there's a moment where you can see the little square view

311
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,320
Speaker 5:  finder on it and that is the moment where you're like, Holy God, is that

312
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,760
Speaker 5:  be enormous? Yeah. And Google does a really good job of hiding it with the

313
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,920
Speaker 5:  other ui. Like it's all really dark and it all sort of like fades off to

314
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,880
Speaker 5:  the sides. So it doesn't, it's not just like color into a black bezel, but

315
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,800
Speaker 5:  it's big. It's real, real, real big. Yeah. If you actually find

316
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,120
Speaker 5:  the thing where it hits against the bezel with color, you'll notice how big

317
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,320
Speaker 5:  it is.

318
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,160
Speaker 6:  I mean I was thinking like, we published this piece yesterday that was kind

319
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,080
Speaker 6:  of like a timeline of the Pixel phone over the years and

320
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,560
Speaker 6:  it reminds me of that very first pixel phone where it was like, there's like

321
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,920
Speaker 6:  some cool ideas in here, but oh, there's some really

322
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,840
Speaker 6:  ugly design choices. Yeah.

323
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,960
Speaker 5:  It was not an attractive phone.

324
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,040
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And, and it feels like that same thing

325
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,680
Speaker 6:  where it's like y'all have some really good ideas but boy, and when it comes

326
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,520
Speaker 6:  to design, Apple just schools you, Samsung just schools you

327
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
Speaker 6:  and they haven't done much to improve that.

328
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,040
Speaker 2:  You know, it's funny, I feel that way about the phones. I don't feel that

329
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,120
Speaker 2:  way about the watch really. I mean you guys have seen I have not. You got

330
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah, Alex and David are in the office. We have a bunch of units. They've

331
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,000
Speaker 2:  actually seen them. David was at the thing. I'm just watching the videos

332
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,480
Speaker 2:  and reacting to the photos like everybody else, the watch seems like a composed

333
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,880
Speaker 2:  thing. Like they have a point of view about it.

334
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,880
Speaker 2:  The band seem really cool. The band attachment mechanism seems really cool.

335
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,240
Speaker 2:  The entire vibe, just from where I'm sitting when you put different bands

336
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,640
Speaker 2:  on, it seems like the entire vibe of the watch changes dramatically. Yep.

337
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,720
Speaker 2:  In a way that is like not true of the Apple watch actually. That's fair.

338
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,400
Speaker 2:  Like you can put the fanciest band on Apple Watch, it's still an Apple watch.

339
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,320
Speaker 2:  This looks like it actually takes on a new character. That part's fine.

340
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,080
Speaker 2:  The Pixel seven is like, you can't convince me that you did anything to

341
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,840
Speaker 2:  design this to make it look nicer. You were just like, screw it. There's

342
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,680
Speaker 2:  Neils gonna complain about it in the podcast, but this is what we got. We're

343
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,600
Speaker 2:  just doing it again. Like I'm just doing it. I mean it's, were you not,

344
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:23,880
Speaker 2:  it's

345
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,360
Speaker 5:  An ugly, you weren't swayed by the 15 minutes of telling you about lemon

346
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,120
Speaker 5:  grass and how nice all the human designs are.

347
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,480
Speaker 5:  No, I'm, I'm shocked. The colors are great. I will say yeah, lemon

348
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,320
Speaker 5:  grass and hazel dumb names, good colors, but I'm kind with you.

349
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,000
Speaker 5:  I mean it's just,

350
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,800
Speaker 6:  Wait, which is the lemon grass and which is the hazel

351
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,920
Speaker 5:  Lemon grass is the, the sort of like off green-ish one?

352
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,240
Speaker 6:  That one's good. Yeah, that

353
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,440
Speaker 5:  Is, it's, it's like other companies would call that like sea foam or something,

354
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,080
Speaker 5:  but Google went with lemon grass and Hazel is, I don't, it's the hazel one.

355
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,440
Speaker 5:  I don't, I don't have a good answer for you

356
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,800
Speaker 6:  On that. And then there's like a gray one

357
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,150
Speaker 5:  That might be the hazel one. I, I don't know. None of these make any sense

358
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,030
Speaker 5:  to me. Yeah,

359
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,950
Speaker 2:  There was a part where Isabelle from Google was like, the centerpiece of

360
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,310
Speaker 2:  our warm colors is lemon grass. And then they showed the lemon grass and

361
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,350
Speaker 2:  I was like, that's a, but that's a cool color. And I still don't know what

362
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,670
Speaker 2:  she meant

363
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,750
Speaker 5:  Because

364
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,710
Speaker 2:  Then they're like, and here's the cool colors and they were indeed much cooler,

365
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,070
Speaker 2:  but I was like, just going back to the green. That's it. Okay.

366
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,190
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. The green was nice. The hazel is the kind of gray color and

367
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,830
Speaker 6:  I, I'm not a fan of that one. It felt a little like it's got too much brown

368
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,390
Speaker 6:  in it for me. That's too warm.

369
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,550
Speaker 5:  I could definitely see that. Yeah. But my thing with the pixel design and

370
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,550
Speaker 5:  ne you've, you've never liked the pixel design and I feel like I, I nothing

371
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,950
Speaker 5:  the pixel design, like I don't, I don't, I don't, I wouldn't say that I like

372
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,670
Speaker 5:  it, but I also like, I have no strong Is

373
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,550
Speaker 2:  This how you broke up with people back when

374
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:43,870
Speaker 6:  You were like,

375
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,030
Speaker 2:  So like, here's the deal. I nothing.

376
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I'm just, I'm WellMed by by this relationship that I have with my

377
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,840
Speaker 5:  seven pro. Yeah. It just feels like it's, it's just like, it's

378
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,480
Speaker 5:  not doing enough for me to like have strong feelings about it. Yeah. But

379
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,400
Speaker 5:  people seem to have really strong feelings about it. I don't

380
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,760
Speaker 2:  Know. I just,

381
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,640
Speaker 6:  I mean it looks, it's shiny. I, I I like that it's, it's

382
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,440
Speaker 6:  very like, it feels luxurious. It looks pretty

383
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,000
Speaker 6:  luxurious.

384
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,760
Speaker 2:  The pixel seven,

385
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,880
Speaker 6:  That's the shiny one, right? No, I'm thinking of the pro.

386
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,520
Speaker 5:  Okay. Yeah. This is what I mean. You, you have strong feelings. How is it

387
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,160
Speaker 5:  possibly We have strong

388
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,560
Speaker 2:  Feelings. Okay, hold on, hold on.

389
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,040
Speaker 5:  We,

390
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,720
Speaker 6:  I have to make sure I'm talking about the right one.

391
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,640
Speaker 2:  Here's what we know. I just wanna put this out there. What we know from

392
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,480
Speaker 2:  our own audience data and from your experience at the event is that people

393
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,520
Speaker 2:  care about the watches more than the phones.

394
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,760
Speaker 5:  Oh unquestionably

395
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,600
Speaker 2:  Your desire to make me dunk on the phones I'm resisting. So we can finish

396
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,360
Speaker 2:  talking about the

397
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,120
Speaker 5:  Watches. Fine.

398
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,600
Speaker 2:  Tell me more about the watches. What's s is updated, How's that working?

399
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,160
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

400
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,200
Speaker 5:  S actually seems really nice. Google has spent a bunch of time over

401
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,560
Speaker 5:  the years trying to make it less complicated. Like I went back and watched

402
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,680
Speaker 5:  the 2014 io where they actually announced Android wear in the first

403
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,640
Speaker 5:  place and it had this like the mental map of Android wear was insane.

404
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It was like you, you, you were on the screen and then it was like there

405
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,720
Speaker 5:  was stuff to the right and stuff to the left and stuff up top and you could

406
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,320
Speaker 5:  go down farther and it was insane. And so Google has pulled all of that way

407
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,080
Speaker 5:  back and it's basically, you, you get like small widgets

408
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,960
Speaker 5:  and feeds and you can swipe down to get to the control panel. It's like,

409
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,680
Speaker 5:  it feels like teeny tiny Android. Like in a good way. Yeah.

410
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,800
Speaker 5:  And at least this watch is I, I confess I'm

411
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,360
Speaker 5:  slightly out of date in my Android smart watch usage. But I, this was my

412
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,680
Speaker 5:  experience and I checked it with V and she agreed that this is like dramatically

413
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,920
Speaker 5:  smoother and better feeling than any Android smartwatch I've ever used.

414
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,240
Speaker 5:  Everything we've used so far for the most part was in like a demo mode. So

415
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,760
Speaker 5:  it's really, it's hard to know what sort of the deep powerful stuff will

416
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,680
Speaker 5:  be like. But even just like little swipes, it was the kind of thing that

417
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,880
Speaker 5:  used to be sort of slow and stuttery and it would like miss when you would

418
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,720
Speaker 5:  flick on the screen and it just didn't seem to do any of that. Like they've

419
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,880
Speaker 5:  done a really good job of actually tuning the thing up to work. And it was

420
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,240
Speaker 5:  one of the things they told me they spent a lot of time on and sort of tacitly

421
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,200
Speaker 5:  admitted in talking about it that like this was a thing they had not done

422
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,080
Speaker 5:  well in the past and eventually realized they should probably get right.

423
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,880
Speaker 2:  So Samsung smartwatches wheres traditionally, like

424
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,440
Speaker 2:  Samsung smartwatches ran ties in for a minute and they merged

425
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,280
Speaker 2:  and where os and then Samsung is doing Samsung stuff, which is like their

426
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,200
Speaker 2:  own riff on it. They barely even mention where os when they introduce

427
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,920
Speaker 2:  new versions of the Galaxy watch, right? Yeah. It's like a flicker

428
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,760
Speaker 2:  of a ghosted image on a slide in the transition between two

429
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,400
Speaker 2:  other slides in their presentations. Right. Subliminal

430
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,440
Speaker 2:  messages like in

431
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,120
Speaker 5:  Between frame white text on a white background that just says Android.

432
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

433
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,240
Speaker 2:  But you know, Samsung watches have a point of view. Right, Right. That you're,

434
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,120
Speaker 2:  and they, and they're kind of like feature laid in and there's lots of buttons

435
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,080
Speaker 2:  and settings, Samsung stuff this from all counts is

436
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,520
Speaker 2:  much more minimal. Right. But it's still wears. Yeah. Do you feel a split

437
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,040
Speaker 2:  there? Do you feel like they've tried to par it down and focus it?

438
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,240
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be a little hard to tell until we can like really put some apps

439
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,440
Speaker 5:  on it and put the thing through it. Space is, but they clearly have tried

440
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,760
Speaker 5:  to do that. Like I think your, your reaction to what they're attempting to

441
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,520
Speaker 5:  do is, is the right one that like they're, they're trying to not make a thing

442
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,800
Speaker 5:  that you spend a lot of time with. Like I, I'm sure you guys noticed this,

443
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,520
Speaker 5:  but like voice interaction continues to be the thing that Google harp's on,

444
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,080
Speaker 5:  right? They're like with all of their devices, they're like voice is the

445
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,040
Speaker 5:  answer. Speech to text and text to speech. Like that's, that's where we're

446
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,200
Speaker 5:  headed. That's where all of this is gonna go. And then they're trying to

447
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,760
Speaker 5:  make things take fewer taps, which I think is meaningful that like

448
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:25,360
Speaker 5:  with the the Fitbit stuff, it should just be sort of a quick scroll through

449
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,920
Speaker 5:  information that you want and Maps works much simp much more

450
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,840
Speaker 5:  simply and they're definitely trying to get to the phase where like Samsung

451
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,160
Speaker 5:  wants you to use your watch like a computer and Google

452
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,560
Speaker 5:  definitely doesn't, I think Google that's still doesn't know exactly how

453
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,960
Speaker 5:  you should use your watch, but the answer is not like a computer.

454
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:47,340
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It feels like this time they've taken more of that

455
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,220
Speaker 6:  Fitbit DNA because for years they, they didn't, they just wanted it to be

456
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,740
Speaker 6:  like a watch that you could also get notifications on because they're like

457
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,660
Speaker 6:  primary person putting wear os into watches was Michael Cores, you

458
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,900
Speaker 6:  know? Yeah. Right. Like they didn't care. Right. And now that they've got

459
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,580
Speaker 6:  the Fitbit, they've got all that fit apparatus behind it and it's like okay

460
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,900
Speaker 6:  we can have a point of view but it's still gonna be software but it's gonna

461
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,010
Speaker 6:  be fitness. It's totally be like that.

462
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,450
Speaker 2:  So that's my, that's my kinda my last big question here. I don't think Apple

463
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,170
Speaker 2:  knows why people are wearing these watches either, really. Right. Like you

464
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:22,050
Speaker 2:  go back in time David, you were saying like the first wears stuff was just

465
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,290
Speaker 2:  a scatter shot mess of things and like huge ideas.

466
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,890
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So bad. So is the first Apple watch, do you remember when Apple was

467
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,490
Speaker 2:  like, you're gonna send heartbeats to people?

468
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,530
Speaker 6:  I wanna do that right

469
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,290
Speaker 5:  Now. It was the two fingers, right? Put two fingers on it and it sends your

470
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:35,530
Speaker 5:  heartbeats

471
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,850
Speaker 2:  Somebody else. It truly bizarre idea. Forgot

472
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,490
Speaker 2:  about that. We should all be doing more of, Honestly Apple should bring the

473
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,530
Speaker 2:  heartbeats thing back. Can

474
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,410
Speaker 5:  I, can I send you my heartbeat now? Yes. Still there. That just opened the

475
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,090
Speaker 5:  weather app didn't work. I tried put two fingers on my watch. Nothing happy.

476
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,810
Speaker 2:  I will say that the walkie-talkie bees, right? Apple Watch is criminally

477
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:56,770
Speaker 2:  underrated, underutilized. I use it all the time. Absolutely. Apple should

478
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,490
Speaker 2:  put all of its development, stop making the carri that watch walkie-talkie

479
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,410
Speaker 2:  better anyhow. But you know like, like all of these devices,

480
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,650
Speaker 2:  Google started a huge idea and they've had to par down Apples sort of a huge

481
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,610
Speaker 2:  idea. And they've had to perton Apple has very much landed on, well

482
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,690
Speaker 2:  the Apple Watch Ultra is like basically a huge computer on your wrist, big

483
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,530
Speaker 2:  screen app store, The whole thing can work

484
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,930
Speaker 2:  independently of the phone now. But really we know that the reason you buy

485
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,090
Speaker 2:  it is like health and fitness. Right. And the Ultra is like the pinnacle

486
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,930
Speaker 2:  of that. Right? They're like, this is for people who dive. Yep. Right.

487
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,090
Speaker 2:  Like you have to pick which band you want depending on what kind of mountaineer

488
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,490
Speaker 2:  you are. And obviously you've already considered that

489
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,130
Speaker 2:  because they know like this is what drives the thing. Google was like, we

490
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,610
Speaker 2:  have to buy Fitbit in order to be competitive. We've added a Fitbit to it.

491
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,240
Speaker 2:  Or there like meaningful fitness features out of Fitbit here. Or is it just

492
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,920
Speaker 2:  a Fitbit?

493
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,240
Speaker 5:  It's basically just a Fitbit. Okay. It seems to be a particularly good one.

494
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,040
Speaker 6:  I feel like that's enough because the Fitbit audience was never the

495
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,480
Speaker 6:  alter audience. It was never the garment audience. It was never like the

496
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,440
Speaker 6:  super fit audience. Right. The Fitbit audience has always been the same audience

497
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,840
Speaker 6:  as the Apple watch where it's like, yeah, sometimes I wanna know my heart

498
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,360
Speaker 6:  rate, sometimes I wanna be able to show my friends that I, I walked outside

499
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,240
Speaker 6:  today so that they stopped shaping me. Like, like that's always kind of been

500
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,880
Speaker 6:  the goal of these products. And this is like, okay finally you have an

501
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,800
Speaker 6:  alternative to Apple if you want. Hopefully if you want just a nice

502
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,680
Speaker 6:  looking watch that does those very basics. And if you

503
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,400
Speaker 6:  wanna get more hardcore than that garment or Samsung or

504
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,840
Speaker 6:  whoever's there. But I think this is really for that that Fitbit audience

505
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,400
Speaker 6:  who's been like dicked around for years. Yeah. With really

506
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,440
Speaker 6:  bad smart watches from Fitbit.

507
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think that's totally right. Like Google needed Fitbit in a big way,

508
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,960
Speaker 5:  but Fitbit also needed Google to like, people have been asking Fitbit to

509
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,600
Speaker 5:  make better looking devices for as long as Fitbit has

510
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,480
Speaker 5:  existed and Fitbit just basically has not been able to do it. Like the company

511
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Speaker 5:  has sort of intermittently tried. Like I remember doing a story God eight

512
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,200
Speaker 5:  years ago maybe, where Fitbit was like, we're gonna start making fitness

513
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,360
Speaker 5:  trackers that are like jewelry. Yeah. And it was like, all right. And then

514
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,040
Speaker 5:  they were like, look at this one we made. It's six inches long and rock

515
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,520
Speaker 5:  solid and it's just a Fitbit.

516
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,240
Speaker 6:  It was just like a black pill and you put it in a gold bracelet.

517
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And I think, I think the thing we, we, we don't talk about enough is

518
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,600
Speaker 6:  like Fitbit's primary audience for a long time was women. Yeah.

519
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,640
Speaker 6:  And and women have been left out oftentimes

520
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,360
Speaker 6:  from smart watches because so many smart watches are these really, really

521
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,520
Speaker 6:  big watches. And a lot of women and a lot of people with smaller love to

522
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,520
Speaker 6:  wear them. I'm wearing one but a lot don't. Yep. And so

523
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,200
Speaker 6:  they've held onto their Fitbits for a very long time or they've just been

524
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,520
Speaker 6:  like, All right, I guess I'm just going to get, you know, a $10 special watch

525
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:38,760
Speaker 6:  at Walmart just so I have something to wear. And this

526
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,640
Speaker 6:  is like, this is for them, This is for people who are like, I don't

527
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,040
Speaker 6:  need all the big gadgets and stuff. I just want something nice that I can

528
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,880
Speaker 6:  like be in on this too with everybody else. Yeah,

529
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,600
Speaker 5:  No I, I totally, I think that's exactly

530
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,320
Speaker 2:  Right. I just wanna come back to the idea that two things you can do with

531
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,840
Speaker 2:  smart watches now are send your heartbeats to people and then per Alex

532
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,440
Speaker 2:  shame them for not walking enough. Yes. Those are your two choices

533
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,000
Speaker 2:  every,

534
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:01,840
Speaker 6:  Do not

535
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,680
Speaker 2:  Remember sending direct taps or

536
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,200
Speaker 6:  Like you didn't walk it up, you

537
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,440
Speaker 2:  Were lazy.

538
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,960
Speaker 6:  Do you remember the, when the Fitbit first came out everyone I know was

539
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,560
Speaker 6:  like, Oh yeah I have a Fitbit cause I care about fitness. Yeah. They're like,

540
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,880
Speaker 6:  No you don't need that. That's too performative. And so

541
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,440
Speaker 6:  it is that like performative stuff going on. Yeah.

542
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,320
Speaker 2:  Well I think it's neat. I'm curious to see, you know, Google took a couple

543
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,560
Speaker 2:  of hard shots at Apple today. We should talk about them more with the phone

544
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,280
Speaker 2:  in the next section. But this is the point now where they can start to

545
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,560
Speaker 2:  pressure Apple even again even in terms of regulations about

546
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,080
Speaker 2:  hey there's a lot of people that would like to buy this watch instead of

547
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,000
Speaker 2:  your watch and you won't let them.

548
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:42,760
Speaker 5:  Yep.

549
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,080
Speaker 2:  And I I think it's, yeah it's probably the same. There's probably some Android

550
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,640
Speaker 2:  people that would like to have an Apple watch just like some Android people

551
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,440
Speaker 2:  buy AirPods or

552
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,400
Speaker 5:  Whatever. Well it's like one, one thing Google would really like you to know

553
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:56,480
Speaker 5:  is that fast pair is a thing that exists and is open to lots of

554
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,360
Speaker 5:  different devices and also that beats headphones use fast pair.

555
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,840
Speaker 5:  Those are two things that I can tell you confidently Googled very much like

556
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,720
Speaker 5:  a lot more people to know. And, and it's like,

557
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,560
Speaker 5:  and I think you're exactly right. Those are the things and that came up even,

558
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,280
Speaker 5:  even during the keynote today was like Google is sometimes

559
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:18,320
Speaker 5:  quietly and sometimes not particularly quietly, like continuing to push

560
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,720
Speaker 5:  Apple on this idea that like if you make this stuff work better,

561
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,200
Speaker 5:  everyone will be happier and be better. And I don't know that there are

562
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,080
Speaker 5:  a ton of iPhone users who are like mad about the Apple Watch but, and a clamor

563
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,840
Speaker 5:  for a Pixel watch. But it would, I it would be a more fun world if we could

564
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,720
Speaker 5:  find out. I I I tend to think Yeah,

565
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That that's, I just, I just keep coming back to that idea. It's like

566
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,080
Speaker 2:  I'm not gonna switch my entire life over to Google Services for a

567
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,000
Speaker 2:  $350 watch. Right. It just doesn't seem likely. So

568
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,680
Speaker 2:  the market is already teeny tiny. They can't go compete in the market of

569
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,320
Speaker 2:  iPhone owners too. Just like Apple can't go compete in the market of Android

570
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,200
Speaker 2:  owners. Apple just seems content cuz all the rich people are on their

571
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,160
Speaker 2:  side. Like that's they know it's true. Yeah. And they're like, okay, we're

572
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,680
Speaker 5:  Gonna, Do you think Google's move is, is it more possible that Google could

573
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,360
Speaker 5:  get people to switch from Samsung to Pixel in order to get a 300 and hundred

574
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,440
Speaker 5:  watch watch? Like is that the move?

575
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,080
Speaker 2:  Does Pixel watch work with Samsung phones?

576
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,600
Speaker 5:  I believe so. The thing on the box, we'll have to test this. So I I I reserve

577
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,400
Speaker 5:  the right to be wrong about this, but it just says an Android phone running

578
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,760
Speaker 5:  Android or later. So it should work

579
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,720
Speaker 6:  Fine. It would be really stupid if it only worked with pixel phones.

580
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,360
Speaker 5:  I'm sure there all I'll be pixel specific stuff. Like I think that it's possible

581
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,240
Speaker 5:  that the, the view finder is one thing that seems likely to me probably only

582
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,840
Speaker 5:  works on a pixel, but I'd be it would be, Yeah, you're stupid of Google to,

583
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,400
Speaker 6:  We're forgetting that like the United States iPhone ran Supreme.

584
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,160
Speaker 6:  The United States is just one country in a lot of places. Android

585
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,960
Speaker 6:  ran Supreme and now like, oh a competitor is Samsung. That's

586
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,800
Speaker 6:  nice looking. That's smaller. Like I could see that doing some real numbers

587
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,520
Speaker 6:  in a lot of places. Yeah,

588
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,360
Speaker 5:  That's true. I think so too.

589
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,920
Speaker 2:  All right, we should take a break. That's the watch 3 49 without

590
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,640
Speaker 2:  LTE 3 99 with lte. It's coming out soon We'll have reviews is always

591
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,520
Speaker 2:  we gotta like use the thing before we can talk even more about it. We gotta

592
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,240
Speaker 2:  take a break. We're gonna come back. We're gonna talk about the Pixel seven.

593
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,080
Speaker 2:  Pixel seven Pro. We'll grab back.

594
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,330
Speaker 2:  Okay, we're back. We talked about the watch a little bit. David try to bait

595
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,650
Speaker 2:  me into talking about the phone. Here's what I'm gonna say about the Pixel

596
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:46,570
Speaker 2:  seven one, just like the iPhone 14. It looks the same

597
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:50,490
Speaker 2:  as the phone before it, which our YouTube commenters don't

598
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,930
Speaker 2:  seem to have understood that we said about the iPhone 14. So that's just

599
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:57,530
Speaker 2:  my note to the YouTube commenters out there who all of whom I'm sure listened

600
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,050
Speaker 2:  to this. Yeah. But you will note that our headline on the iPhone 14 review

601
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,730
Speaker 2:  was this is the iPhone 13 s. Yeah, sorry.

602
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,970
Speaker 2:  You could have had what you wanted, you just didn't, didn't Google it from

603
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:12,330
Speaker 2:  all like I know what to tell you. We gave you the thing you want, you're

604
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,450
Speaker 2:  like, I would like some chocolate chips. And we're like, Yes, they're here.

605
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:18,170
Speaker 2:  And you're like yelling at us. There's no chocolate chips. This is what get

606
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:21,770
Speaker 2:  what you want. There's only one skill and it's getting what you want. It's

607
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,810
Speaker 2:  true. That's my life advice for you today. Second, it's still

608
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,210
Speaker 2:  ugly.

609
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,570
Speaker 2:  They're just ugly phones. I don't know what to tell you about them. That

610
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,170
Speaker 2:  camera bump is horrendous. The colors are slightly nicer. They have

611
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:40,130
Speaker 2:  refined some of the edges or you know, like they've done some things, they're

612
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:40,650
Speaker 2:  not attractive.

613
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,610
Speaker 6:  I think that they're shiny and maybe I'm just like easily

614
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:48,850
Speaker 6:  distracted by shiny at this point. But I was like, ooh, that that gold bump,

615
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,810
Speaker 6:  it's so shiny with a glass underneath. Ooh. Like that just,

616
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,250
Speaker 6:  I don't want it. I don't wanna own this device cuz I, I just bought a phone

617
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,050
Speaker 6:  and I don't need another one. But, but I was like that is, that is appealing.

618
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,250
Speaker 6:  That is a pleasing look to my eyes.

619
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,370
Speaker 5:  Yeah this is my thing Mi Eli. Like I just don't get the hatred for

620
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:06,890
Speaker 5:  it. It's like,

621
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,890
Speaker 6:  Is it because it's so boring? It's

622
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,770
Speaker 5:  Like looking at this like boring white table and being like, that

623
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:15,970
Speaker 5:  table is so ugly. It's like no it's not interesting enough to be ugly. Like

624
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,450
Speaker 5:  what are we talking about?

625
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,850
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I don't, all phones are kind of boring now. Maybe

626
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,290
Speaker 5:  That's, It's true. I'll give you

627
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,850
Speaker 2:  That. I'm just like the back of this thing, the glass and then the weird

628
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,130
Speaker 2:  surround and the like at least my pixel sixes, there was a like a noticeable

629
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,410
Speaker 2:  ridge between the glass and the metal and I haven't touched the seven. Maybe

630
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,890
Speaker 2:  they ever find it. They're just ugly. Like

631
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,080
Speaker 6:  The bump is bad, the bump is bad but it's not as

632
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,720
Speaker 2:  Bad. This is like someone, like a Google engineer opened one of the AI image

633
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,640
Speaker 2:  generators and was like generic smartphone. And then it's like this

634
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,240
Speaker 2:  sort of like mutated AI version of a generic

635
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,040
Speaker 2:  smartphone got spit out every time. It's, I don't know, it's like the uncanny

636
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,520
Speaker 2:  value of generics fund design, whatever. It doesn't matter. You're gonna

637
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,320
Speaker 2:  put it in a case. Anyway, the cases last year were horrible. Chris Welch

638
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Speaker 2:  says the cases this year are slightly better. Chris

639
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,360
Speaker 5:  Wel, I just, Chris Welch deserves some credit for this. I'm just gonna tell

640
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,000
Speaker 5:  a very short story about Chris Welch. So I'm wandering around the Google

641
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,640
Speaker 5:  store, like looking at the phones, taking video, taking pictures and I walk

642
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,520
Speaker 5:  over and Chris Welch is standing in front of a wall display reaching up to

643
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:21,720
Speaker 5:  a set of three pixels, about eight or nine feet off the ground. And

644
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,800
Speaker 5:  he's just yanking at one of them. And I'm like, Chris, what are you doing?

645
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,680
Speaker 5:  And he's like, Just hold on, don't just everything. Make sure everything's

646
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,600
Speaker 5:  fine. And he literally just yanks the case off of one of them, pulls it

647
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,160
Speaker 5:  down, takes off his own case, puts them down and goes to those feel any different.

648
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,160
Speaker 5:  And he goes, Nope, it's the same. That sucks. And then just walks away.

649
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,560
Speaker 5:  I was like all Chris just yanking phones off walls. It's

650
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,960
Speaker 5:  like if you did that at an Apple event, they would've killed you like right

651
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,720
Speaker 5:  then and there somebody would've just sniped you from the Steve Jobs theater.

652
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But at the Google store they don't

653
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,280
Speaker 2:  Care. I will say when I put on the Apple Watch Ultra, the Apple event things

654
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,920
Speaker 2:  were dicey for one moment. They were like,

655
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,160
Speaker 2:  maybe you should be in jail and

656
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,520
Speaker 5:  And at the Google store they're like, you're touching our phone. Hooray.

657
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,560
Speaker 5:  That's all they want.

658
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,920
Speaker 2:  All right, so look, that's the way it looks. You're gonna put a case on anyway.

659
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,840
Speaker 2:  We should talk about the phones new tensor ship, the g2, she's

660
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,160
Speaker 2:  very proud of. What else?

661
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,040
Speaker 5:  New cameras. And I actually, I wanna talk about the cameras because Google

662
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,520
Speaker 5:  talked a lot of shit about Apple and then basically just said we did the

663
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,680
Speaker 5:  Apple camera, but we'll come back to that tensor g2. There's a

664
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,720
Speaker 5:  6.3 inch screen on the Pixel seven and 6.7

665
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,640
Speaker 5:  inch screen on the Pixel seven Pro. Both have variable refresh rate,

666
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,280
Speaker 5:  both go up to 90 hertz. It's all like medium exciting. They did a bunch of

667
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,560
Speaker 5:  stuff with phone calls that I thought was pretty interesting. They're like,

668
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,400
Speaker 5:  one of their big new features was stuff that if you're going through a,

669
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,880
Speaker 5:  like a phone tree to you know, press nine to get to whatever, it'll just

670
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,840
Speaker 5:  show that to you as a menu on your screen now and you can just tap the thing

671
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,000
Speaker 5:  you want. That's awesome. I'll send you where you're going. It's very smart.

672
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,880
Speaker 5:  And they did a bunch of AI work to like improve the quality

673
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,400
Speaker 5:  of phone calls. You can reduce background noise and enhance your own voice.

674
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,840
Speaker 5:  So there's just a bunch of little things like that kind of all over the phone

675
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,280
Speaker 5:  speaker recognition on the recorder app, which is one of those things that

676
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,200
Speaker 5:  no one cares about. But a room full of journalists got really excited about

677
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,520
Speaker 5:  it. Like it got the biggest gasp of any announcement from the reporters in

678
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,760
Speaker 5:  the room. And that is the entire list of people who will use that feature.

679
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,480
Speaker 5:  And then, yeah, just a ton of of little things. They spent a lot of time

680
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,920
Speaker 5:  on the camera. That was obviously the thing. And like Google is, is in the

681
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,480
Speaker 5:  same way that Google is crystal clear that people buy smart watches for health

682
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,400
Speaker 5:  reasons. They buy phones for cameras. Like that just is true. And well

683
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,240
Speaker 6:  They have to like the cool feature this year was that they can take your

684
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,280
Speaker 6:  crummy, blurry photos and make them look better. Right.

685
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean that's kind of been Google's thing for a a while, right? Like

686
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,600
Speaker 5:  the, the magic eraser thing works relatively well.

687
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,040
Speaker 5:  They did have the new feature where they'll do it with your old photos that

688
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,120
Speaker 5:  I think is very cool. Yeah. And there was a guy walking around the Google

689
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,560
Speaker 5:  store after the event who was very proud that he thought he was the first

690
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,720
Speaker 5:  person to use the hashtag fixed by Pixel. And he was like, we should make

691
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,360
Speaker 5:  that a thing. And the Google place were like, yeah.

692
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,920
Speaker 5:  Oh boy. So that was fine. But, but yeah that idea that Google

693
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,840
Speaker 5:  can not only like help you take better pictures but actually fix them after

694
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,440
Speaker 5:  the fact is a big part of what they're starting to push on now with all the

695
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,720
Speaker 5:  AI and ML stuff and

696
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,240
Speaker 2:  Well, well so, but that one in particular they announced was you've taken

697
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,240
Speaker 2:  thousands of photos with the cameras in the past phones in the past. You

698
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,480
Speaker 2:  buy a Pixel seven and you have Google photos

699
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,520
Speaker 2:  and then Google photos on your Pixel seven using the

700
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,320
Speaker 2:  tensor G2 will will like upscale your old blurry

701
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,160
Speaker 2:  photos or de blur them or something.

702
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,080
Speaker 5:  That's right. What is a photo Eli? What is a photo?

703
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:33,440
Speaker 2:  Well, so like the, the what is a photo vibes coming off the pixel

704
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,280
Speaker 2:  event Oh yeah.

705
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,880
Speaker 5:  Are out of control. Oh yeah.

706
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:40,040
Speaker 2:  Like fully out of control. So just that, why can't Google photos just do

707
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,320
Speaker 2:  that? Right? Like Google Photos runs on Google servers

708
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,520
Speaker 2:  but do you pay for Google photos? Yes. I pay quite a bit of money

709
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,840
Speaker 2:  for Google Photos. Okay. Nevermind. I have like the upgraded storage plan,

710
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,560
Speaker 2:  the whole thing. I mean goo like famously Google gave Google photos away

711
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,560
Speaker 2:  for free. Yeah. Until they destroyed the market for photo services and now

712
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,240
Speaker 2:  they charge for

713
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,120
Speaker 5:  It. Right. That's actually a super interesting question cuz it's not like

714
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,040
Speaker 5:  Google Photos is short of access to processing power. Right? Like

715
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,360
Speaker 5:  Google has data centers, those can do some things. That's really interesting.

716
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That that is a device specific thing that has to have been just a deliberate

717
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,560
Speaker 5:  marketing choice. There's no technical reason to just not put that into Google

718
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:16,800
Speaker 5:  photos.

719
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:20,800
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I think it was Dan who said they, they say they need

720
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,600
Speaker 2:  something in the tensor G2 chip to do it, but it's like you make the

721
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:24,920
Speaker 2:  chip.

722
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:25,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

723
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,880
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And also your data centers are full of tensor chips.

724
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,640
Speaker 5:  That's like a part of the whole thing. Like the tensor came out of all the

725
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,320
Speaker 5:  work they were doing in their data centers. Like these two things are the

726
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,400
Speaker 5:  same.

727
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:39,080
Speaker 2:  So I just, that's a little confusing. But that's one thing, and I don't even

728
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,480
Speaker 2:  think that like really implicates the what is a photo conversation. Like

729
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,720
Speaker 2:  you have an old photo and you're gonna do some processing on it to make it

730
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,240
Speaker 2:  a better photo. Like I, I understand how that works. Cause you still have

731
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,640
Speaker 2:  the old photo, right? Yeah. Now you just have like this second improved version,

732
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,920
Speaker 2:  like that's just photo editing, right? Like maybe it's a more complicated

733
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,400
Speaker 2:  thing, but you, you're, you've like created a photo, you're, it the camera

734
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,320
Speaker 2:  on the pixel seven is just far beyond like

735
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,240
Speaker 2:  capturing a still image in time. Yes. It just has

736
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,960
Speaker 2:  abandoned that idea of photo that way. Like

737
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,680
Speaker 2:  almost completely. And so the one that really got me was all of the

738
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,440
Speaker 2:  Zoom stuff they're doing. Yep. Where they're like, okay, we have

739
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:22,720
Speaker 2:  a number of zoom lens, we have an ultra wide, we have a wide, we have a zoom

740
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,360
Speaker 2:  at every point along the magnification

741
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,080
Speaker 2:  from regular to two x to 10 x to whatever

742
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,680
Speaker 5:  Else. 30 is the max, which is bananas.

743
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,560
Speaker 2:  We're gonna merge frames from multiple cameras, run them through

744
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,600
Speaker 2:  the HDR pipeline that we've set up, and then do AI

745
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:44,240
Speaker 2:  to create more detail. And it's like, yo, like at some point

746
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:48,160
Speaker 2:  it really is, you're just holding up your phone to reality

747
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,400
Speaker 2:  and giving the AI prompt Yeah. Like recreate this

748
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,360
Speaker 2:  the scene. Like, like it might as well be dolly for reality, right?

749
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,560
Speaker 6:  Like Google interpret reality.

750
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,200
Speaker 2:  Right? Like, and if you just like watch that, I encourage, you're gonna go

751
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,920
Speaker 2:  watch it again and just like come at it from that perspective. Wouldn't you

752
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,560
Speaker 2:  take a photo? You think you are capturing a moment in time, right?

753
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,520
Speaker 2:  You're gonna open the shutter, Some pixels are gonna hit the thing and close

754
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,880
Speaker 2:  the shutter. And there's a lot to be said about how long the shutter is open

755
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,600
Speaker 2:  and how long that moment in time really is and all this stuff. Google

756
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,520
Speaker 2:  is now like literally a computer is looking at reality and

757
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,360
Speaker 2:  it's gonna try to faithfully reconstruct what we think that reality is. Yeah.

758
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,280
Speaker 2:  Using more data than your eyes can possibly process at once.

759
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:34,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah. We've, we've moved away from like optics being the primary way

760
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,480
Speaker 6:  that like the light is gathered and interpreted and now it's like, okay,

761
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,080
Speaker 6:  the optics are gonna gather the light and then we are actually gonna interpret

762
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,320
Speaker 6:  it.

763
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's like a it's like a rendering engine. Yeah. That is just very

764
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,400
Speaker 5:  lifelike. It, it's kind of wild. Especially I noticed the same thing in the

765
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,800
Speaker 5:  Zoom ones where it's like they're going through and he just is like, okay,

766
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,560
Speaker 5:  it takes, you know, if you want to be at between two and five x

767
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,400
Speaker 5:  zoom, it's gonna take the telephoto lens and the

768
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,280
Speaker 5:  wide lens and actually do some work to comp them together. And it's like,

769
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,000
Speaker 5:  okay, we're still working from images here. And then it's like by the time

770
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,680
Speaker 5:  you get to 30, it's like, okay, we're doing, we're stabilizing for handshake,

771
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,120
Speaker 5:  we're doing all kinds of crazy stuff on the other end. We're pixel bidding.

772
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,800
Speaker 5:  It's like I'm snapping the shutter and that is the beginning of like a

773
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,400
Speaker 5:  16 step process that ends in, I get a thing that looks like a photograph.

774
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:22,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But there's so much happening in between there that Google is in charge

775
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,480
Speaker 5:  of that. It is just wild.

776
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:27,280
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And there's so much that isn't really

777
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,240
Speaker 2:  transparent about what's going on there. I

778
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,880
Speaker 5:  Mean, except at the end you get to see what you see and the photo at the

779
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,520
Speaker 5:  end. Like there's at least a check on what the thing just Yeah. But

780
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,080
Speaker 6:  You're noting seeing those, those processes, like if I'm in Photoshop, I

781
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,080
Speaker 6:  can see every layer, I know what I'm doing. Whereas this, it's like,

782
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,530
Speaker 6:  Right. I mean most people probably like, That's fine though. Like I think,

783
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,010
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

784
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,090
Speaker 2:  I think most people think it's fine. But like what Dave was talking about

785
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:54,370
Speaker 2:  with the Zoom on the stabilized zoom when you shoot a video

786
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,450
Speaker 2:  and they were like, we know this is noisy so we're just gonna

787
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:03,290
Speaker 2:  clean it up. And they just showed like adding detail back to the thing the

788
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:07,090
Speaker 2:  sensor couldn't have captured. That's weird. Yeah. Like you

789
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:10,170
Speaker 2:  should, there's just something about all of this that's like, we're getting

790
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:13,970
Speaker 2:  a little, we're getting a little closer to the photo is just

791
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,810
Speaker 2:  a prompt. Yeah. Or a number of systems to just

792
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,170
Speaker 2:  spit out an image that you, that it thinks you will like.

793
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,890
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I'm really excited for the Spike Jones movie

794
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,170
Speaker 6:  in like five years where like somebody's running from

795
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,050
Speaker 6:  a crime that their Google Pixel phone

796
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,920
Speaker 2:  Like no, this already. No, no, no, no. This is what I'm saying. Like not

797
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,600
Speaker 2:  to get too dark. Yeah. This was the basis of a

798
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,280
Speaker 2:  completely nonsensical set of objections in the Kyle Written House trial.

799
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:43,280
Speaker 2:  Oh wow. Do you remember this? Wow. They had all this photo evidence and his

800
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,080
Speaker 2:  lawyers were like, Your honor, like Apple iPhones are, they are known

801
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:51,000
Speaker 2:  to use AI to interpolate scenes however they want. And

802
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,160
Speaker 2:  like evidence got tossed out because the prosecutors in Kenosha, Wisconsin

803
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,080
Speaker 2:  were not very good.

804
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,120
Speaker 2:  And they were just like not prepared for this objection. Like it's, it's

805
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,800
Speaker 2:  already has happened in a very high profile case that like, Wow. Yeah. The

806
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,760
Speaker 2:  thing that a camera makes is so unknown that you can like, you

807
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,680
Speaker 2:  can undo it, you can undo its validity because you can't, you have to

808
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,840
Speaker 2:  bring in an expert to explain how it works. And like that has nothing to

809
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,480
Speaker 2:  do with family photos. Like I'm very happy that the Google Pixel seven pro

810
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,400
Speaker 2:  can like take a better picture of a child than Yes. The phone that came before

811
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,760
Speaker 2:  or a phone from two years ago. But just philosophically,

812
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,520
Speaker 2:  the thing that happens when you push a shutter button is getting

813
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,600
Speaker 2:  farther and farther away from like

814
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,520
Speaker 2:  centuries of cultural expectation of what pushing a shutter button does.

815
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:39,320
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And there's no like underlying transparency of

816
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:43,360
Speaker 2:  here is this moment as it existed in time and here is this

817
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,360
Speaker 2:  thing that we made that is the best version of that moment.

818
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:50,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I remember Google saying to me a while ago, and I think this was with

819
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,480
Speaker 5:  the, either the first or the second pixel that, Do you guys remember what

820
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,960
Speaker 5:  those phones, you would take the picture and then you would open it up in

821
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,880
Speaker 5:  the photos app and it would show up slightly blurry and

822
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,400
Speaker 5:  then it would sort of resolve. Yeah. They told me at the time,

823
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,880
Speaker 5:  and there's like a 60% chance this was a lie, but they told me at the time

824
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,360
Speaker 5:  that that was deliberate. That it's like it should you, They wanted you to

825
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,360
Speaker 5:  understand that something was happening to the photo that you took as Google

826
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,320
Speaker 5:  was, was like working its magic on it. And

827
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,760
Speaker 5:  that should have gotten better and instead it just went away. And there's

828
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,120
Speaker 5:  like, it's so abstracted away from what users see now

829
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:27,960
Speaker 6:  It's, it's weird because like camera makers figured this out, right?

830
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:31,880
Speaker 6:  They said, Okay, you'll get a raw and that's what we're taking. That's optically

831
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,600
Speaker 6:  the thing, right? And then we're gonna give you a jpeg and a can

832
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,840
Speaker 6:  JPEG is gonna be way warmer than it should be because

833
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,000
Speaker 6:  Canon just thinks that's prettier and, and we're gonna do tons of, tons of

834
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,080
Speaker 6:  processing. And so like they, they've already kind of acknowledged that and

835
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,480
Speaker 6:  said, Okay, but we're still gonna give you the raw and apple's finally giving

836
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,440
Speaker 6:  us the raw. And I think like kind of making that connection and making that

837
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,320
Speaker 6:  more common might be part of the solution here to like escape

838
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,840
Speaker 6:  this like kind of wonky, philosophical and

839
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,040
Speaker 6:  potentially legal quandary. Totally.

840
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:06,240
Speaker 5:  So the, the thing about the camera that really struck me though, it was like

841
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,200
Speaker 5:  in the course of all of these announcements was they just did

842
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,120
Speaker 5:  the apple stuff with the camera, right? Yeah. Like they're doing some of

843
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,520
Speaker 5:  the same pixel bidding. The, the cinematic stuff is very Apple,

844
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,800
Speaker 5:  all of this. And this all came as simultaneously, Google is just taking

845
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,320
Speaker 5:  every opportunity it can to just knife apple about

846
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,160
Speaker 5:  RCS just repeatedly and crash detection coming three years ago and all this

847
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,640
Speaker 5:  stuff. And it's just like, like I had this moment of sitting there and being

848
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,840
Speaker 5:  like, Oh, all phones are the same now. Yeah. And everybody's just gonna yell

849
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,120
Speaker 5:  at each other about everything And all the phones are the same. Like this

850
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,120
Speaker 5:  is just where we are. Yep.

851
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:42,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah, they made, they have the list, right? It was like they're always on

852
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,880
Speaker 2:  display in car crash detection, lock screen, widgets,

853
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,440
Speaker 2:  night mode. Like they made a list. Like here's all the

854
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,400
Speaker 2:  stuff we did first that Apple picked up and then they, It's true. They got

855
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,520
Speaker 2:  to the camera section, they're like, Here's what we can do. It's a two x

856
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,160
Speaker 2:  zoom and we crop the sensor. And it's like, yeah, we just, I think there's,

857
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,080
Speaker 2:  there's an element where it's, once you have the big pixel bin sensor,

858
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,560
Speaker 2:  there's a handful of moves that you get out of it that are

859
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,920
Speaker 2:  very obvious, right? Yeah. Yeah. You can stop pixel bidding and you can crop

860
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,160
Speaker 2:  in and use the pixels natively. It all comes down to the processing on the

861
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,880
Speaker 2:  backend. So I, you know, I think you all know this way Apple's

862
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,680
Speaker 2:  processing to me it's just like way outta control lately. And pixels

863
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,120
Speaker 2:  traditionally been better. So like, I think we gotta review the phones to

864
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,920
Speaker 2:  see. Yeah, it just, I just keep coming back to this like Google

865
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,840
Speaker 2:  is being so aggressive with letting AI step in and

866
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,640
Speaker 2:  fix the photos that like, it's like, do I even trust this anymore? I

867
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,840
Speaker 2:  don't know, maybe it's just like old

868
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,320
Speaker 5:  School. Yeah, I mean it was interesting being in the room too, cuz the

869
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,880
Speaker 5:  demos that they showed like Apple, Apple is very funny in the sense that

870
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,200
Speaker 5:  there's very clearly like a large team of people at Apple whose job it is

871
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:51,200
Speaker 5:  to just go to beautiful waterfalls and take the pictures that they

872
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,040
Speaker 5:  use in their slides. Yeah. And they even said during the

873
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,160
Speaker 5:  keynote today that like one of the pictures they used as an example of how

874
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,000
Speaker 5:  good the zoom was was just like a shot. A person who works at Google took

875
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,880
Speaker 5:  and the demos they showed were not great, but were probably

876
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,600
Speaker 5:  substantially more realistic than the stuff that like I'm gonna get out of

877
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,080
Speaker 5:  my iPhone.

878
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,880
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Cuz iPhone, The iPhone is like, you know what, are you ever on a

879
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,600
Speaker 6:  dune in a desert at night

880
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:20,280
Speaker 5:  With 11 professional photographers? You've

881
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,840
Speaker 2:  Been there, you ever worn a sweater at du in Paris with three

882
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,680
Speaker 2:  beautiful people

883
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,440
Speaker 5:  And there's just a

884
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,240
Speaker 2:  Crew of lighting engineers

885
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,240
Speaker 6:  And everyone has very vibrant hats on

886
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,680
Speaker 2:  The next time we review the phone, the hat budget's got gotta interest.

887
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,480
Speaker 6:  Oh, gotta absolutely increase it.

888
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,920
Speaker 5:  But it, it was just striking to me to see like a, these two companies

889
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,840
Speaker 5:  are competing more head-to-head I think than ever because like Google's talking

890
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:50,600
Speaker 5:  a ton about tensor at the same time Apple is talking a ton about the

891
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,000
Speaker 5:  recent a series and m series chips and it's like these companies are competing

892
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,920
Speaker 5:  along the same lines now. Yeah. And it's gonna be really interesting over

893
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,680
Speaker 5:  the next couple years to see there's so many places they could push it, but

894
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,200
Speaker 5:  they're all betting on,

895
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,880
Speaker 2:  Well there's one line they're not competing on, which is that Apple sells

896
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:07,840
Speaker 2:  a million phones and carriers will all but pay you to get a

897
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,120
Speaker 2:  new iPhone fair. And Google sells vanishingly few phones. I think

898
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,120
Speaker 2:  Vlad Sav, one of our former ver senior editor, former

899
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,760
Speaker 2:  co-founder, former co-founder, existing co-founder, permanent co-founder

900
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,880
Speaker 2:  now Bloomberg tweeted he asked IDC Google since 2016

901
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,640
Speaker 2:  has sold like 27 million pixels. That's as many phones as Samsung

902
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,520
Speaker 2:  sell in a year. Like Google has to

903
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,800
Speaker 2:  sell. Like, I mean it's just like ridiculous situation.

904
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,920
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So many more phones.

905
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And there was a, there was a line today that Google has like doubled

906
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,000
Speaker 5:  its order for the pixel sevens cuz they're, they're hoping to sell more and

907
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,040
Speaker 5:  it's really, it's like they're going from like a tiny number to a

908
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,160
Speaker 5:  tiny number. Like good job Google. Like, we're proud of you.

909
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,200
Speaker 5:  But it's a long road to

910
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,680
Speaker 2:  Go here. It's a long road to go. We should quickly, we gotta get, we gotta

911
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,000
Speaker 2:  bring Liz and talk about Elon. We should quickly talk about the tablet.

912
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:57,040
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah.

913
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,080
Speaker 2:  I'm very excited about just because I, I have a Nest hub

914
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,640
Speaker 2:  and we use it for photos and we talk to Google to set timers, all the

915
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,200
Speaker 2:  things. Well the one thing you do, you said timers, you ask for music occasionally

916
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,920
Speaker 2:  you ask it to play YouTube tv, which is very cool when it works. So like

917
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,640
Speaker 2:  having a bigger version of that is cool. But if you can also run Chrome

918
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:20,520
Speaker 2:  on a fast processor done. Yes. Like kitchen computer

919
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:24,480
Speaker 2:  solved. And so like, I'm gonna buy one in this dock that lets you turn

920
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,440
Speaker 2:  it into a Nest hub just because having the backstop of like, screw it,

921
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,080
Speaker 2:  I'm just gonna open Chrome. Yeah, sounds great. But

922
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,680
Speaker 6:  Lenovo already did it. Lenovo's been doing it right, Like

923
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,080
Speaker 6:  have

924
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,880
Speaker 2:  You But they put like a garbage media tech processor in their thing.

925
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah. With like a, the big bele like

926
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,840
Speaker 2:  Amazon has already done it too. But then you've gotta use Amazon's weird

927
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,680
Speaker 2:  browser on their bad check.

928
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,200
Speaker 6:  Okay. So so what's appealing to you is that it's it's a different form.

929
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:52,720
Speaker 6:  It's a different processor.

930
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,040
Speaker 2:  What's appealing to me is that Google appears to have cared about processing

931
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,920
Speaker 2:  capability in the tablet by putting in their high end arm chip. Everybody

932
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,120
Speaker 6:  Else has,

933
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,360
Speaker 2:  Right? Like Lenovo has done it, but that like fully cheaped out on this

934
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:08,320
Speaker 2:  tablet. Yeah. Like bad display, chunky, you know,

935
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,000
Speaker 2:  bad construction, shitty processor. Like life's too short for slow

936
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,880
Speaker 2:  computers, man, you know, like I'm gonna just go get my laptop. How,

937
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,440
Speaker 6:  How expensive is it gonna be? That's, that's because like Lenovo cheaped

938
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,080
Speaker 6:  out because they were like, we wanna get it down to a price that it makes

939
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,000
Speaker 6:  sense. Yeah. And this is like, seems pricey.

940
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,040
Speaker 2:  David, did they have the tablet there? Did you get to play with it? No,

941
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,880
Speaker 5:  We went, we went looking for it and there were, there were several instances

942
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,520
Speaker 5:  of people like wandering around the Google store trying to peel

943
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,440
Speaker 5:  apart a Nest hub Max to try and find it to no avail. That's pretty good.

944
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,680
Speaker 5:  But the, there was no tablet and we don't know what it's gonna cost. We don't

945
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,480
Speaker 5:  know when it's coming. It does from all the videos look very much like

946
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,560
Speaker 5:  a Samsung tablet from like eight years ago. But it seems to be very powerful.

947
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,160
Speaker 5:  And I'm with you on the idea that like a full chrome browser on

948
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:56,440
Speaker 5:  my Nest hub Max goes a long way. Like I think the big questions for me

949
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,960
Speaker 5:  are like, is the speaker on the dock gonna be any good? Are they gonna do

950
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,960
Speaker 5:  a good job with the farfield microphones so that it feels enough like a nest

951
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,640
Speaker 5:  from far away? And how much does it cost? Are

952
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,320
Speaker 2:  They gonna do the ambient photo mode thing where they do the reflective color?

953
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:10,280
Speaker 2:  You know, like they gotta do that to make this really work.

954
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,440
Speaker 6:  Yes. Well they they, they gotta release it first.

955
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,560
Speaker 5:  Well there's there's that too. It is very much still vaporware. But I think

956
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:19,320
Speaker 5:  they, they said this thing during the keynote that was like, a lot of people

957
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,280
Speaker 5:  get tablets and then they're like dead in drawers or charging in corners

958
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,800
Speaker 5:  all the time. And that is, is largely my experience of phoning a tablet.

959
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,000
Speaker 5:  It's like, it is a home device. Like it, it is a thing I use around my house

960
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,040
Speaker 5:  much more often than I use it anywhere else. And so I think they're like,

961
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,240
Speaker 5:  they're, they're on to something smart about how people actually use their

962
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,560
Speaker 5:  tablets. We'll see how well they actually pull it off. But I agree that like

963
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,440
Speaker 5:  fast processor and full chrome browser instantly makes this thing

964
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,280
Speaker 5:  more useful than anything else I've ever put in my kitchen than

965
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,000
Speaker 10:  The KitchenAid.

966
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:49,800
Speaker 2:  It's true. The

967
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,040
Speaker 5:  Knives, It's the second most sinkful gadget I've ever put in my kitchen.

968
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:54,520
Speaker 5:  Is the kitchen a

969
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,000
Speaker 2:  Gadget? Do you not have a, we're

970
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,080
Speaker 5:  Talk about this is a kitchen or is a sink a gadget?

971
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,920
Speaker 2:  Here's what I want. I want a 2.3 gigahertz process from my microwave.

972
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,800
Speaker 2:  I want it step All right, that's all the stuff we we're gonna get it.

973
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,680
Speaker 2:  We're gonna get reviews, we're gonna go into it in detail when we actually

974
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,640
Speaker 2:  get to chance to play with this stuff outside of the watchful eyes of

975
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,800
Speaker 2:  Google employees. That's coming up soon. We gotta take a break. Bring Liz

976
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,840
Speaker 2:  on. Oh boy. We gotta talk about Elon and Twitter. We'll be right back.

977
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:30,230

993
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,150
Speaker 2:  last hour with Elon and Twitter?

994
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,550
Speaker 10:  Yes, of course. So I

995
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,190
Speaker 5:  Of course

996
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,390
Speaker 2:  As is always, okay, so does El does he own it yet? No.

997
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:44,310
Speaker 10:  Okay, so he filed a thing with the Delaware court saying,

998
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:47,950
Speaker 10:  hey, we should have a stay of proceedings cause I'm totally gonna buy it.

999
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:51,150
Speaker 10:  Like I'm totally buying it this time. And then Twitter like filed their

1000
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:54,710
Speaker 10:  own little thing that's like, absolutely don't stay the proceedings. We

1001
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:57,830
Speaker 10:  don't buy this. We think he's up to some mischief. Which, you know what,

1002
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:01,790
Speaker 10:  I kind of agree with Twitter here because like, just given what a

1003
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:05,630
Speaker 10:  week today has been, I think that like, I think that

1004
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,510
Speaker 10:  we're, I think we're in for more shenanigans and I also think I'm still

1005
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:09,430
Speaker 10:  going to Delaware.

1006
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:13,190
Speaker 2:  Okay, so let's just back up. When Liz says she's gonna Delaware, what she

1007
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:16,390
Speaker 2:  means is she's going not for like a pleasure visit, although I think you

1008
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:19,790
Speaker 2:  might have a good time. She's gonna go to the trial, which is taking

1009
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:22,950
Speaker 2:  place at the Delaware Chancery Court, right? That's what you might do on

1010
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,360
Speaker 2:  in Delaware.

1011
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,520
Speaker 10:  That is what I'm going to do.

1012
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,400
Speaker 2:  Let's just back up before today in this last hour of surprise

1013
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,320
Speaker 2:  news. So Elon said he was gonna buy Twitter for 54 20 a share. It's

1014
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,640
Speaker 2:  44 billions April, nice God only knows what. And a

1015
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,000
Speaker 2:  bunch of rich people

1016
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,280
Speaker 5:  Parent, Wait, wait, wait. Please sum up the entirety of the last six months

1017
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,480
Speaker 5:  of Elon and Twitter in the next 60 or so seconds. Just can

1018
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,400
Speaker 2:  Start clock. Let's see if I can,

1019
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,280
Speaker 10:  All right, the timer going. You've got, you've got 60 seconds starting

1020
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:51,880
Speaker 10:  now.

1021
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:56,000
Speaker 2:  Okay. So in April, Elon tweeted himself into buying Twitter.

1022
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,640
Speaker 2:  There's no other way to describe it. For 54 20 a share, which is

1023
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:03,480
Speaker 2:  44 billion. Nice. It turns out a bunch of rich people

1024
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,160
Speaker 2:  texted him embarrassing ideas about Twitter, including Mark Benny out the

1025
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,760
Speaker 2:  CEO of Salesforce who just said things like Twitter os conversational Os

1026
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,120
Speaker 2:  for your life and Twitter. And Elon said, Screw you, then may he gets cold

1027
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,240
Speaker 2:  feet. He sues Twitter says, I want out the deal because there's so many bots

1028
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,040
Speaker 2:  in your platform. Twitter says, What the hell are you talking about? We'll

1029
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,040
Speaker 2:  see you in the Delaware quarter chance Ray. We've been in a lawsuit ever

1030
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,800
Speaker 2:  since. Elon's entire bot argument has proven to be a total fraud

1031
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,200
Speaker 2:  full of shenanigans. He's losing, losing, losing. We're coming up on trial.

1032
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,160
Speaker 2:  He's supposed to be deposed today. Trial starts October 17th.

1033
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,200
Speaker 2:  He files a letter with the Security exchange commission, not the court saying,

1034
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,880
Speaker 2:  I'm fine, I'm gonna do it. The court puts out a letter yesterday saying,

1035
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,400
Speaker 2:  No one has filed a motion to stay this trial. We're continue. Then there's

1036
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,200
Speaker 2:  been a lot of shenanigans today leading up to Elon saying to the court,

1037
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:49,120
Speaker 2:  Please stay. Which means pause the trial. I'm actually gonna do it. Twitter

1038
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,560
Speaker 2:  won't say yes for an answer. That was the last hour.

1039
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,280
Speaker 10:  That's a minute.

1040
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,400
Speaker 2:  And now we're here.

1041
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:56,000
Speaker 5:  That was amazing. Well done.

1042
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:00,000
Speaker 10:  So I also wanna say the other thing is, if you weren't paying attention,

1043
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,680
Speaker 10:  their reports that Elon, his deposition got moved back, which is what I

1044
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,240
Speaker 10:  think all of the shenanigans this week were about was were about pushing

1045
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,200
Speaker 10:  back that deposition by saying, Oh Twitter, we're really serious. Come back

1046
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,600
Speaker 10:  to the bargaining table because you know this was gonna be a really unpleasant

1047
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,320
Speaker 10:  deposition for him because the judge found this week that he

1048
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:21,440
Speaker 10:  may have irretrievably deleted some signal messages that

1049
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:25,600
Speaker 10:  oh, pertained to the deal. Which that great. And then there's also a bunch

1050
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,080
Speaker 10:  of questions about the bot stuff because that didn't really show up in the

1051
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,600
Speaker 10:  text messages that we saw with, for instance, Paraag

1052
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:36,320
Speaker 10:  Agrawal who had sort of politely asked Elon to stop saying

1053
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,280
Speaker 10:  rude stuff about Twitter on Twitter. And Elon was like, What did you

1054
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,720
Speaker 10:  do this week? Which like pretty solid burn. Yeah,

1055
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,280
Speaker 2:  No, just to be clear, he said stop. I think it was like, what did you get

1056
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,600
Speaker 2:  accomplished this week? Or what did you get done this week? Implying that

1057
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:49,720
Speaker 2:  he was,

1058
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,520
Speaker 5:  What did you get done this week? Yeah, yeah.

1059
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:52,480
Speaker 10:  In like

1060
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,440
Speaker 6:  30 seconds after the text from Pro came

1061
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:00,240
Speaker 10:  In. Again, a pretty solid burn, but like I definitely would not like, you

1062
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,960
Speaker 10:  know, go through all of these like court proceedings just to like

1063
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,880
Speaker 10:  get a cool burn. But like, yeah, that's me. I don't know.

1064
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:11,080
Speaker 2:  So then Elon puts out this letter, we all kind of bought it, right? He says,

1065
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,920
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna buy Twitter 54 20 a share and then we like read the letter and

1066
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:18,360
Speaker 2:  then I'm gonna actually buy, It was like conditional in weird ways. Like

1067
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:22,320
Speaker 2:  you have to pause the lawsuit, you have to drop your claims, I

1068
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,080
Speaker 2:  have to get my money out of the banks. And we're like, wait, this

1069
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:29,600
Speaker 2:  is nothing. If you're Twitter, you've already

1070
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:33,600
Speaker 2:  had Elon Promise to buy you for 54 20 a share, right?

1071
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,280
Speaker 5:  But

1072
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,840
Speaker 2:  This time he means, so why would you believe him? Now he

1073
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,680
Speaker 10:  Serious Eli, come on. Oh, and the other thing I'm just gonna add

1074
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,240
Speaker 10:  here is that Elon is famously an S sec disrespect,

1075
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,160
Speaker 10:  which you may recall from previous shenanigans involving Twitter where

1076
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,840
Speaker 10:  he tried to take a Tesla pub or a Tesla private

1077
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,360
Speaker 10:  for four 20 a share and then like changed his mind about that. And then

1078
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,320
Speaker 10:  there was a tw like a S sec settlement and he was supposed to have like

1079
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,400
Speaker 10:  a Twitter sitter, which he may or May does or does not have. Sort of hard

1080
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,560
Speaker 10:  to tell. So you know, he's gone on the record saying he doesn't respect

1081
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,240
Speaker 10:  the S E C, which makes the s e c letter a particularly funny

1082
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,720
Speaker 10:  move to me. Like, yeah, I'm gonna file a letter with this

1083
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,320
Speaker 10:  organization that has nothing to do with the Delaware Court and that I don't

1084
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,160
Speaker 10:  respect saying that I'm gonna buy Twitter now. You should take it seriously.

1085
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:21,640
Speaker 5:  Well, and it seems like a big part of his whole thing through this whole

1086
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:25,320
Speaker 5:  process has been essentially assuming that the rules don't apply to him

1087
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,280
Speaker 5:  because he has lots of evidence that the rules don't apply to him. And then

1088
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,040
Speaker 5:  slowly realizing that in the Delaware Court of Chancery,

1089
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:36,040
Speaker 5:  the rules look an awful lot like they're going to apply to him. Yes. And

1090
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:39,840
Speaker 5:  as, as that has become more and more clear, he has gotten more and more nervous

1091
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,760
Speaker 5:  about what's gonna happen, especially as it got towards his deposition and

1092
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,480
Speaker 5:  the text with his friends came out. Ne the only thing you missed in your

1093
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,280
Speaker 5:  description was Jason Kalik Anis, who I now think is the single funniest

1094
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,520
Speaker 5:  and most important part of the entire Elon Musk Twitter saga. Yeah.

1095
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,080
Speaker 5:  Someday we will just do a dramatic reading of all of his texts on this podcast

1096
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,640
Speaker 5:  and it will be a great day. But that like the, the vibe I get consistently

1097
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,240
Speaker 5:  is is just Elon suddenly going, Oh, like this might actually,

1098
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:08,240
Speaker 5:  I might lose. Like, I don't know that that occurred to him for a long time

1099
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,960
Speaker 5:  and it now sort of seems like it has occurred to

1100
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,840
Speaker 10:  Him. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, one of the things

1101
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:17,440
Speaker 10:  that I've been keeping an eye on throughout this

1102
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,400
Speaker 10:  trial is that, or these legal proceedings I guess, cause we

1103
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,080
Speaker 10:  haven't gotten to the trial yet. This is the mechanism, the forcing mechanism

1104
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,880
Speaker 10:  for Twitter, right? And so like, if you're trying

1105
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,760
Speaker 10:  to get this done because you want certainty, you can do things like

1106
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,720
Speaker 10:  say, hey, we'll forego the trial if, and

1107
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,480
Speaker 10:  like maybe knock a buck or two off the deal price if you

1108
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,400
Speaker 10:  just do the deal. Yeah. You know? And but as

1109
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,240
Speaker 10:  these, these motions have been coming in and over and over again,

1110
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,800
Speaker 10:  the court has mostly been ruling in favor of Twitter and finding out things

1111
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,680
Speaker 10:  like, you know, at the one of the last hearings that Elon Musk spot

1112
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,440
Speaker 10:  experts actually seem to agree with Twitter's spot estimates. That's

1113
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,280
Speaker 10:  brutal. Which is something of a problem for Elon Musk's case,

1114
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:08,080
Speaker 10:  just putting it out there as we're finding these things out, his

1115
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:11,960
Speaker 10:  case just looks worse and worse. And although like the lawyers who are working

1116
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,680
Speaker 10:  on this case are really serious and frankly kind of scary,

1117
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:20,120
Speaker 10:  this isn't the kind of case that even serious and

1118
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:23,960
Speaker 10:  scary lawyers can be certain they're going to win. Because I don't think

1119
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,760
Speaker 10:  the facts are necessarily an Elon's favor. And so the closer we get to

1120
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,600
Speaker 10:  this, the more we find this out. And then like the other thing that's

1121
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,520
Speaker 10:  going on is the deposition, which was supposed to happen today and got pushed

1122
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,360
Speaker 10:  back. So my personal going theory, like everybody tinfoil hats

1123
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,000
Speaker 10:  on. Cause I can't see what's happening in these negotiations, I'm just guessing.

1124
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:47,200
Speaker 10:  But my personal theory is that he tried to push back his deposition

1125
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:51,120
Speaker 10:  by filing this letter with the s e c and

1126
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,880
Speaker 10:  succeeded in doing so. And there's a really hard deadline coming up for

1127
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,600
Speaker 10:  all of the pretrial stuff, which I believe is

1128
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,640
Speaker 10:  October 12th. So if

1129
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:05,480
Speaker 10:  Elon Musk's deposition is pushed back, that gives Twitter less time to work

1130
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:09,280
Speaker 10:  with it and less time to prepare for trial because he's super important

1131
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,200
Speaker 10:  to all of these events. And that like kind of makes trial

1132
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,800
Speaker 10:  a lot more annoying for Twitter.

1133
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:19,320
Speaker 6:  Can he, sorry, can he avoid, can he like

1134
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,520
Speaker 6:  push the deposition back even further and be like, Oh, I got a cold today

1135
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,800
Speaker 6:  so I can't do it. So Oh, and I guess we're gonna have to push the

1136
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,800
Speaker 10:  Whole trial. Well, he's already done that once, so I, I feel like

1137
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:30,240
Speaker 2:  That's

1138
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,920
Speaker 10:  Good. I, I feel like the answer is probably no and you end up in a relatively

1139
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,400
Speaker 10:  serious situation where your lawyers get sanctioned or something if, you

1140
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,320
Speaker 10:  know, he doesn't get deposed before trial. And I

1141
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,520
Speaker 10:  don't think his lawyers really want to be sanctioned. So I think he does

1142
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,760
Speaker 10:  actually get deposed if we go to trial. I just think that it's going to

1143
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,640
Speaker 10:  be in a super annoying and inconvenient way because the entire legal strategy

1144
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,160
Speaker 10:  here, I would characterize as the, I'm not touching you

1145
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,840
Speaker 10:  legal strategy where it's like,

1146
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:04,160
Speaker 10:  you know, like it's technically within the rules, but it's really

1147
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:08,400
Speaker 10:  annoying and like it's violating the spirit and maybe not the letter of

1148
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,400
Speaker 10:  the law. And so that's kind of what I think is happening here.

1149
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,080
Speaker 2:  This is my favorite, like it's not even a c plot, it's like a d or an

1150
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,720
Speaker 2:  Elott, is that the state of Delaware is

1151
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,600
Speaker 2:  the state where all businesses get registered. Like Ved

1152
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:26,320
Speaker 2:  is a Delaware corpor, like just down the line. Any big company, it's a Delaware

1153
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,200
Speaker 2:  corporation and they like hold themselves out in the

1154
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:34,120
Speaker 2:  market of states that you might register your corporation in is like being

1155
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,000
Speaker 2:  good at corporate law and having this court system that like

1156
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:42,000
Speaker 2:  adjudicates dispute sufficiently and Elon

1157
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,120
Speaker 2:  is fucking with that,

1158
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,480
Speaker 2:  right? And so like this court like wants none of it. And then the lawyers

1159
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:52,640
Speaker 2:  in this court have other clients in these courts

1160
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:56,120
Speaker 2:  and their rep is like getting screwed with.

1161
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:01,120
Speaker 2:  And you can just see it's like, oh, this is bad. Like look, we got,

1162
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,840
Speaker 2:  we have a real nice little country club going here in Delaware. Like

1163
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:08,520
Speaker 2:  get out. Like you can just see there, there there's, there's kind of like

1164
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:12,320
Speaker 2:  the part where the rules apply in the Delaware court is kind of, because

1165
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:16,400
Speaker 2:  the state of Delaware's like image is on the line for where

1166
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,240
Speaker 2:  all these corporate disputes happen and all of the players inside

1167
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,880
Speaker 2:  those disputes are pretty clubby. Like these lawyers are gonna be back in

1168
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,760
Speaker 2:  front of this judge tomorrow on a different case. This judge has a

1169
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,120
Speaker 2:  rep with her appeals court, like just up and down the line. This is a group

1170
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:35,000
Speaker 2:  of people that work together to do these things all day long and Elon's

1171
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,840
Speaker 2:  desires are sort of like just tangential to

1172
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,760
Speaker 10:  It. So the other thing that's worth keeping in mind, Delaware being a

1173
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,200
Speaker 10:  center for corporate law, is that there are other Elon Musk suits that are

1174
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,880
Speaker 10:  currently pending in Delaware. Of course

1175
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,800
Speaker 2:  There are, Oh God,

1176
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:53,040
Speaker 10:  My personal favorite is a lawsuit about his pay package, which

1177
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,680
Speaker 10:  incidentally is going to be going in front of this very same

1178
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:57,400
Speaker 10:  judge.

1179
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:58,360
Speaker 2:  That's great.

1180
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:03,120
Speaker 10:  So she's gonna have some feelings about how much she

1181
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,960
Speaker 10:  can rely on what he has to say based on what's happened here.

1182
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:10,760
Speaker 10:  So I kind of feel like maybe as an being

1183
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,360
Speaker 10:  anno as annoying and it's possible in order to like make Twitter

1184
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:18,000
Speaker 10:  unhappy is not the best strategy here.

1185
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:22,320
Speaker 10:  But I'm not Elon Musk, so who knows, maybe everything works out beautifully

1186
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:25,400
Speaker 10:  for him. Not only does he walk away from the Twitter deal leaving like a

1187
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,360
Speaker 10:  smoking crater, he also like gets his amazing pay package

1188
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,280
Speaker 10:  and that's the end of that. But I just think strategically it's a

1189
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,040
Speaker 10:  really bad idea to annoy judges. That's, that's just

1190
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,960
Speaker 10:  my like non, you know, expert thought about the legal

1191
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,520
Speaker 10:  system is that maybe don't annoy the judges

1192
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:49,040
Speaker 5:  Well and is it a fair characterization to say that

1193
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,160
Speaker 5:  Kathleen McCormick, who's the chancellor in Delaware and is

1194
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,320
Speaker 5:  adjudicating this case, basically has made very clear that her general stance

1195
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:00,040
Speaker 5:  is like, I'm not having any of this bullshit. I don't wanna play your dumb

1196
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,960
Speaker 5:  games, let's just keep things moving. Like that seems to have been the, her

1197
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:08,040
Speaker 5:  overwhelming response this week was like, cute story. Everybody see you on

1198
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,040
Speaker 5:  October 17th.

1199
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,360
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean she said so in one of her filings that she hadn't received,

1200
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,960
Speaker 10:  she hadn't received anything. And I just like, I just saw something cross

1201
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,680
Speaker 10:  the guys. Hold on.

1202
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,760
Speaker 2:  She grant this day

1203
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:21,920
Speaker 10:  It looks like she granted this stay.

1204
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,920
Speaker 2:  Okay, we try to do it live. This

1205
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,280
Speaker 5:  Is great. Yeah. This is happening live. This

1206
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,240
Speaker 2:  Is how we're gonna end the segment. Here you

1207
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,920
Speaker 5:  Go. This feels extremely appropriate that this is happening live.

1208
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,480
Speaker 10:  This is just what my day has been like. I've been trying to keep up with

1209
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,440
Speaker 10:  the court filings and honestly I'm just sort of getting rolled over.

1210
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:38,520
Speaker 10:  Yeah.

1211
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,280
Speaker 10:  Okay, let's, let's look at this.

1212
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,440
Speaker 2:  Should we read it together?

1213
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:48,000
Speaker 10:  Yes. So the action is stayed until 5:00 PM

1214
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,680
Speaker 10:  on October 28th, 2022 to permit the parties to

1215
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,640
Speaker 10:  close on the transaction. If the transaction does

1216
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:59,200
Speaker 10:  not close by 5:00 PM on

1217
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,600
Speaker 10:  October 28th, 2022, the parties are instructed to contact me

1218
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,680
Speaker 10:  by email that evening to obtain November, 2022 trial dates.

1219
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:05,800
Speaker 2:  Okay?

1220
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,400
Speaker 5:  And then in all caps, it is so ordered, which is an unbelievably fantastic

1221
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,880
Speaker 5:  way to end all communication that I intend to do from now on.

1222
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:14,640
Speaker 2:  I mean, that's what if you, if you're a judge, do you get to do it all the

1223
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,560
Speaker 2:  time? I know it rules. So she granted Elon's

1224
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,960
Speaker 2:  motion and said, okay, we're giving you a delay for basically

1225
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,720
Speaker 2:  11 days, right? The trial was supposed to start on October 17th, right?

1226
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:29,520
Speaker 2:  And she's like, We're giving you 11 more days until

1227
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:33,520
Speaker 2:  October 28th to figure it out with Twitter. And if it doesn't, you have to

1228
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,320
Speaker 2:  let me know and we're gonna go to trial in November. Now I know why she

1229
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:41,560
Speaker 2:  did this. Most cases should settle. The correct policy

1230
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:45,400
Speaker 2:  outcome in this case is not the government ordering Elon

1231
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,400
Speaker 2:  Musk to buy Twitter, right? Yeah. It just isn't.

1232
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,320
Speaker 10:  That's just the funniest.

1233
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:52,560
Speaker 2:  It's the funniest. And that's like, courts don't want to do

1234
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,520
Speaker 2:  it. They want people to settle their own disputes. And so she's holding

1235
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:00,240
Speaker 2:  the sword and she's like, I've still got it. I'm just gonna put it away for

1236
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,120
Speaker 2:  10, 10 more days. And you figure it out. And I think what they need to

1237
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:08,000
Speaker 2:  figure out is a discount on the price, right? Like that's gotta be

1238
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,640
Speaker 2:  what they're holding them up. That's

1239
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,240
Speaker 10:  Sort of the question to me. I actually think, given the s e c letter, it's

1240
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,280
Speaker 10:  not about an, it's not about a discount on the price at this point. I think

1241
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,240
Speaker 10:  it's about the condition for the deal.

1242
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:20,320
Speaker 10:  So

1243
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:23,400
Speaker 10:  what I

1244
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:25,640
Speaker 2:  Like this is live reacting,

1245
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:30,000
Speaker 10:  Like what I, what I think is going on here, given that Elon has said he'll

1246
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,600
Speaker 10:  buy the price he previously agreed to, and that the

1247
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,200
Speaker 10:  shareholders have already voted for that price, is that a lower price

1248
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:41,240
Speaker 10:  is unlikely. I think instead Twitter wants confirmation

1249
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,200
Speaker 10:  this deal gets done. Like they wanna make sure that they're not Charlie

1250
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:48,120
Speaker 10:  Brown and Lucy isn't gonna take the football away again. So my guess

1251
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,520
Speaker 10:  is like there's some sort of terms and conditions they wanna hammer out

1252
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,440
Speaker 10:  and like that's been part of the hold up in this whole process is that

1253
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:59,680
Speaker 10:  Twitter is saying that Musk has put conditions on

1254
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:03,640
Speaker 10:  this that weren't on the original deal. And I don't blame them

1255
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:06,360
Speaker 10:  for wanting to go ahead with the court case, especially because they think

1256
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,720
Speaker 10:  they're going to win and Elon Musk is gonna have to pay all their legal

1257
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:12,320
Speaker 10:  bills in addition to all of his own legal bills. That's said

1258
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,200
Speaker 10:  like, I don't know man, I'm, I'm

1259
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:20,200
Speaker 10:  still skeptical about this. We'll see, I, if I'm

1260
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,360
Speaker 10:  in Delaware in November, I'm gonna be real annoyed.

1261
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,720
Speaker 10:  Let's put it that way. It's very cold.

1262
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,280
Speaker 2:  Liz is very excited about being Delaware in October, but once you get past

1263
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,720
Speaker 2:  October into November, the research left to do,

1264
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:36,840
Speaker 10:  That's exactly what it is. I live in California, I don't get to see like

1265
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,640
Speaker 10:  fall foliage. So I was like, all right, well that'll be really pretty. Like,

1266
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,480
Speaker 10:  I'm excited about that. Like maybe I'll go for a hike or something. That'll

1267
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:42,560
Speaker 10:  be

1268
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,920
Speaker 2:  Cool. It's over Delaware, November, it's happening for you. So here's what

1269
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,680
Speaker 2:  I'll say. So the, the Twitter letter, opposing Elon's motion to

1270
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:52,440
Speaker 2:  stay, which means the delay, they're like, they haven't, he still

1271
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,200
Speaker 2:  hasn't accepted his contractual obligations. He hasn't put a timeline on

1272
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,760
Speaker 2:  it. He won't give us a closing date. And so the judge here

1273
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:04,040
Speaker 2:  has at least solved one problem. She said, I'm giving you a date if you're

1274
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,880
Speaker 2:  not, if this date, you don't hit it October 28th, we're we're gonna

1275
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:11,040
Speaker 2:  trial. So we'll see. I mean, they, they could hit it sooner, but there's

1276
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:15,200
Speaker 2:  the, the threat is still there. And I think that the threat is the most important

1277
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,320
Speaker 2:  thing for Twitter. The underlying conditions. We'll see, it's just gonna

1278
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,040
Speaker 2:  be weird when, when he ends up in either direction, he ends up

1279
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,040
Speaker 2:  like Squiring out of it or he ends up owning Twitter. Both

1280
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:27,600
Speaker 2:  extraordinarily weird outcomes.

1281
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:31,520
Speaker 5:  O obviously you're live reacting here, but like does this, do we have any

1282
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,520
Speaker 5:  sense that this makes one or the other of those things any more likely?

1283
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:38,440
Speaker 10:  Oh, I think Elon Musk winds up owning Twitter. I think it's just about all

1284
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,600
Speaker 10:  over. But the shouting at this point, like,

1285
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:44,760
Speaker 6:  I have questions about the money because Twitter's lawyers said

1286
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,800
Speaker 6:  something earlier today to the judge and, and one of the things they said

1287
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,520
Speaker 6:  was like, people from these banks have testified that they haven't talked

1288
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,360
Speaker 6:  to him about closing the deal, whereas, and so like, where is the money gonna

1289
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,240
Speaker 6:  come from? Doesn't he have to sell Tesla stock? Doesn't he have to still

1290
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:02,160
Speaker 6:  get all of these banks to like do this all in 11 days? And

1291
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,080
Speaker 6:  for banks, that's three days as I understand it. So

1292
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,360
Speaker 10:  He's definitely already sold a bunch of Tesla stock. Okay. So that, that

1293
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,920
Speaker 10:  part is, that part is handled. And then Matt Levine,

1294
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:15,600
Speaker 10:  who I think you all know, we stand here at the Verge,

1295
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,760
Speaker 10:  Stan a legend been reading him since deal breaker. He has like

1296
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,160
Speaker 10:  the sort of blow by blow of how this kind of thing works. And he doesn't

1297
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,600
Speaker 10:  seem to think it's that big of a deal for these lawyers to get it done.

1298
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:31,840
Speaker 10:  Okay. Maybe they haven't talked to each other for in a while. Maybe it's

1299
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,400
Speaker 10:  gonna be a little slower than one might anticipate, but he thinks he thinks

1300
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,560
Speaker 10:  it happens. And I have no reason not to believe him, Not least of which

1301
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,720
Speaker 10:  is that he, like, he's a former corporate lawyer, Like he actually knows

1302
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:45,400
Speaker 10:  how this stuff gets done from the inside. Now do I think that there

1303
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,400
Speaker 10:  are, there's a possibility of Elon Musk shenanigans? I do.

1304
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:52,720
Speaker 10:  I always think that there's a possibility for Elon Musk shenanigans.

1305
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:57,400
Speaker 10:  So I'm like, well see, I I will believe the deal

1306
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:01,040
Speaker 10:  is closed when I see that the deal has closed and not

1307
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,880
Speaker 10:  before that because I just, there are so, there have been

1308
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,600
Speaker 10:  so many like weird like moments in this case,

1309
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:12,560
Speaker 10:  like, you know, for instance involving the All In

1310
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,400
Speaker 10:  podcast, which is hosted by Jason Khan and like, I gotta say, like one of

1311
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,400
Speaker 10:  the things that I appreciate about the text is that he sounds exactly like

1312
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,520
Speaker 10:  he sounds on that podcast. So, you know, he's like legit. Yep.

1313
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:26,360
Speaker 2:  Yes, I've known Jason for a long time. Jason started in Gadget.

1314
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:30,080
Speaker 2:  There's no, The man is, there's no opacity to that man. Yeah,

1315
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,400
Speaker 2:  it's his best quality. It's he's he's the same person in every ever

1316
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,400
Speaker 5:  The game is the game.

1317
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:35,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1318
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,560
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Dude's authentic. So, you know, like there's been

1319
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:43,040
Speaker 10:  a lot of stuff going on, some of which has been goofy, some

1320
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,800
Speaker 10:  of which has been ridiculous, some of which has just felt like stalling.

1321
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,360
Speaker 10:  Like a lot of the stuff this week to me has felt like stalling, but we'll

1322
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:54,280
Speaker 10:  see, I don't know, like maybe this is like Elon turning over a new leaf

1323
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,960
Speaker 10:  and getting really excited about testifying in front of Congress

1324
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:01,760
Speaker 10:  about his social media platform and what he's doing to like oppose the various

1325
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,280
Speaker 10:  things that Congress thinks are bad.

1326
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:06,640
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah. Liz assigned me this story when we thought this deal was actually

1327
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,080
Speaker 2:  when we thought that letter meant something. She's like, You've gotta write

1328
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:12,120
Speaker 2:  the Elon Musk, Elon Musk content moderation story. I will tell you, I'm gonna

1329
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:16,040
Speaker 2:  write it when the deal closes. Just, I'm not gonna do it before. I'm not

1330
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,520
Speaker 2:  gonna do my homework before I have to. Yeah,

1331
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,160
Speaker 5:  We've been, we've been played before,

1332
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:23,320
Speaker 2:  But my proposed headline is straight up Welcome to hell Elon Musk.

1333
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:24,840
Speaker 10:  So,

1334
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,640
Speaker 2:  Okay. Just a list of things that he's gonna have to figure out that basically

1335
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,120
Speaker 2:  no one in history has ever figured out.

1336
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:34,040
Speaker 10:  I just want Verge cast listeners to hold ne Eli accountable to this. Like,

1337
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:37,120
Speaker 10:  I just want you all to make sure that he files on time. I

1338
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:37,760
Speaker 2:  I'm

1339
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,000
Speaker 10:  Gonna pure pressure, pure pressure my boss into filing to me.

1340
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:42,640
Speaker 10:  Sorry David,

1341
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:47,080
Speaker 5:  I just, I have found myself wondering, so there was this like, clearly strategic

1342
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,720
Speaker 5:  leak that the New York Times and the Wall Journal both had like an exactly

1343
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,120
Speaker 5:  simultaneous exclusive story saying that Elon had tried to get a lower price

1344
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,480
Speaker 5:  for Twitter and all I've been able to wonder in like the 24 hours since

1345
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:01,960
Speaker 5:  is what is the number that Elon flips from? I will pay this much to not

1346
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:05,440
Speaker 5:  own Twitter, to I will pay this much to own Twitter. And it's like, if Twitter

1347
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,920
Speaker 5:  just sits down and it's like the number's $30 billion, like would he rather

1348
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:12,840
Speaker 5:  pay 30 billion and then have Twitter at the end? Or would he rather pay 30

1349
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,720
Speaker 5:  billion and then just go about his life and never have to think about any

1350
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,360
Speaker 5:  of this again? And I feel like there is a number somewhere where that flips

1351
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,120
Speaker 5:  and I have been wondering a about what,

1352
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,120
Speaker 6:  It's 53 69.

1353
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:24,680
Speaker 5:  It did ends in 69 for sure. Yeah, that's the only thing we

1354
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,960
Speaker 2:  Know. It's definitely, it's definitely 49 or 42

1355
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:34,800
Speaker 2:  69. Here's the question though, like no matter what happens, he's

1356
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,920
Speaker 2:  still addicted to Twitter.

1357
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:36,760
Speaker 10:  Yes.

1358
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:41,920
Speaker 2:  Right? Like he can't quit this shit. So even if he pays

1359
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,600
Speaker 2:  the money and walks, he's like, you know, he's gonna have that moment where

1360
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:48,480
Speaker 2:  like gets home alone and it's all done and like, you know, and he's still

1361
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,120
Speaker 2:  riding high, but there's no one there. Everyone knows this moment, right?

1362
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:54,760
Speaker 2:  And he like, there's a beat and he pulls out his phone, he's

1363
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,840
Speaker 5:  Gonna tweet I love cheese.

1364
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,960
Speaker 2:  Right? And like, you know, and there's like no one in the house. He's like

1365
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,680
Speaker 2:  talked about how it's weird when there's no one in his house. Yep. And he

1366
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,880
Speaker 2:  like pulls out his phone and he is like, Oh, what app should I open? And

1367
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,560
Speaker 2:  it's Twitter. And then he is like, tweets some insane shit about Russian

1368
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,520
Speaker 2:  Ukraine. Again, like, it doesn't matter how much money he loses at

1369
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:16,240
Speaker 2:  the end of the day, Twitter has Elon, Elon doesn't have

1370
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:16,600
Speaker 2:  Twitter.

1371
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:17,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1372
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:21,320
Speaker 2:  Like it's just, they're the same thing now. All right,

1373
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:25,200
Speaker 2:  we've gone over my friends as always. Thank you

1374
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,400
Speaker 2:  Liz. There's some stuff you should read, Allison, that there's like a lot

1375
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,800
Speaker 2:  of things happen today. Yeah, a lot of things happen today, including,

1376
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:35,400
Speaker 2:  I would remind you the reveal of Chris Pratt's

1377
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:38,960
Speaker 2:  liar's mouth in the new Mario trailer. That

1378
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,440
Speaker 5:  Feels like it was decades ago now.

1379
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:41,560
Speaker 10:  So long

1380
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,360
Speaker 2:  Ago. Allison reviewed the iPhone 14 plus big screen.

1381
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,720
Speaker 2:  I'm telling you, big cheap screens the way to go.

1382
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:50,880
Speaker 5:  Long battery life on that thing too big battery life,

1383
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:54,400
Speaker 2:  Long battery life. The steam deck is now available with no

1384
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,200
Speaker 2:  reservations, which I can't believe Alex didn't do a whole hour

1385
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,560
Speaker 2:  on that on this show.

1386
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:03,360
Speaker 6:  I'm fine. I'm I already have mine. Go get one. You already

1387
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:07,240
Speaker 2:  Have one. Of course. The matter standard is not official. By the way. Twitter

1388
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,200
Speaker 2:  rolled out the edit button in the United States for Twitter Blue subscribers

1389
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:15,960
Speaker 2:  today in another time. There was a whole hour of our show, just
