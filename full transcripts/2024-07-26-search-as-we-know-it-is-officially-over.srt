Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, David Pierce, and Jake Kastrenakes discuss OpenAI's new SearchGPT product, Amazon's plan to launch a paid version of Alexa, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold review, and whole lot more.

2
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:15,655
Speaker 3:  Verge for like 15,

3
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,815
Speaker 5:  Something like that. Yeah, I, I don't, we didn't exist technically 15 years

4
00:01:19,815 --> 00:01:22,775
Speaker 5:  ago, but emotionally I was here back in those days.

5
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:23,975
Speaker 4:  It's always been here.

6
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:26,415
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I see. In this office it was empty.

7
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:27,375
Speaker 3:  Just

8
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,495
Speaker 5:  Waiting. Yeah. Financial district was different back then, but

9
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:33,855
Speaker 3:  Our office used to be the Goldman Sachs building. So this is your fault.

10
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:36,775
Speaker 5:  I I have a lot to apologize for.

11
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,055
Speaker 3:  This is, that's true story.

12
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:39,695
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

13
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:43,655
Speaker 3:  The ghosts of of finance bros haunt us every day in this

14
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:47,615
Speaker 3:  office. Anyhow, Jake, you don't know this, but last week on the show

15
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,735
Speaker 3:  we were discussing the iPad and David outta nowhere

16
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:55,975
Speaker 3:  just fired astray and said he didn't believe pilots used iPad

17
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:59,775
Speaker 3:  minis on planes. And I, I dunno

18
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:03,055
Speaker 3:  man, he was wrong. David, would you like to defend yourself? So

19
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:04,175
Speaker 4:  First I would, or apologize,

20
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:06,255
Speaker 5:  I'm need you to issue a correction here. I would

21
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:09,935
Speaker 4:  Like, I was miscategorized by Neela Patel's just now what I said

22
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:13,815
Speaker 4:  was this is like the canonical real

23
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:17,055
Speaker 4:  world use case for iPads that if you, if you ask anyone

24
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:21,335
Speaker 4:  at or around Apple about like what is a thing people do with an

25
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:24,735
Speaker 4:  iPad, they all just want to tell you about Delta pilots. And so why

26
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:26,575
Speaker 3:  Specifically I've iPad Mini. Yes

27
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:30,175
Speaker 4:  The iPad Mini, which apparently like, you know, pilots strapped to their

28
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:33,455
Speaker 4:  leg and do stuff with terrific. I simply,

29
00:02:33,465 --> 00:02:34,535
Speaker 5:  Sorry, tell me about the leg.

30
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:38,735
Speaker 3:  'cause you're flying a plane. So where are you gonna put the screen?

31
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:40,095
Speaker 4:  Wait, it's right there. It's a, it's a

32
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:43,255
Speaker 5:  Right because have they have the entire console of physical buttons?

33
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:46,935
Speaker 3:  Well no those are mostly not screens as well. We're gonna

34
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:48,575
Speaker 5:  So my apologies.

35
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:50,815
Speaker 3:  They're gonna come for you. YouTube. No, this good. You need to be careful.

36
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,575
Speaker 4:  This is good Email Jake and not me.

37
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:54,335
Speaker 5:  This is why I'm not on the show for five

38
00:02:54,335 --> 00:02:56,815
Speaker 4:  Years with a list of every button on a plane. That's, that's important. Please

39
00:02:56,815 --> 00:02:59,725
Speaker 3:  Do that. I would, I would like to apologize to the entire aviation community

40
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:00,165
Speaker 3:  at this time.

41
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:01,485
Speaker 4:  So Nobert,

42
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:04,525
Speaker 3:  I'm on your team. And, if you can get me into an F 22,

43
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:06,565
Speaker 3:  I think that would be great.

44
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:11,085
Speaker 4:  So what I actually heard, which was very cool, is that there

45
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:15,045
Speaker 4:  is a lot of iPad usage specifically on planes and I heard from

46
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:18,605
Speaker 4:  commercial pilots, I heard from hobbyist pilots like the whole gamut

47
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:22,765
Speaker 4:  and there are a lot of uses for it. But it seems like the number one

48
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:26,605
Speaker 4:  main one is just that flying involves both a lot of

49
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:30,525
Speaker 4:  paperwork and a lot of reference material. And to take it from a giant

50
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:34,725
Speaker 4:  like binder in a rolling suitcase down to an iPad makes a lot of people

51
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:38,205
Speaker 4:  very happy. I heard from a few people that they're now like using them in

52
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:41,125
Speaker 4:  flight schools. So when you're training to get your pilot license, you actually

53
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,765
Speaker 4:  like are given an iPad in the way that like kids are given a Chromebook.

54
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:47,685
Speaker 4:  It's just part of the process now and a lot of people take it through. So

55
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:52,045
Speaker 4:  I, I didn't know and now I know it is apparently a very real

56
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:52,245
Speaker 4:  thing

57
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:54,405
Speaker 3:  And that's why the iPad been exists. They

58
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:58,365
Speaker 4:  Actually, I just took my iPad mini to an airport and they just gave me

59
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:01,885
Speaker 4:  a pilot license. It was the most insane thing. I just fly

60
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:05,805
Speaker 3:  Now America Skies are no longer safe. Alright, there's a lot of

61
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:09,685
Speaker 3:  news this week beyond David and the pilots. As we sat down in the studio

62
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:13,965
Speaker 3:  opening, it launched search GPT, it's direct competitor

63
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:17,805
Speaker 3:  to to Google and interestingly Bing, which runs an opening,

64
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:21,525
Speaker 3:  it's a lot, we gotta talk about that. There's a bunch of gadgets, there's

65
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:24,805
Speaker 3:  a lot of news about what Amazon is doing with Alexa to talk about.

66
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:28,925
Speaker 3:  Boy that's been a long time that Amazon's been trying to figure out Alexa

67
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:33,005
Speaker 3:  and then we got a lightning round un unsponsored. But Jake is here so Jake

68
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:35,445
Speaker 3:  will be the sponsor of lighting around. Welcome Jake.

69
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:36,085
Speaker 4:  Thanks for

70
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:39,765
Speaker 3:  Having me. Yeah. Alright, let's start with search TBT. It is

71
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:43,085
Speaker 3:  the news. It is the big news. It's the thing that everyone saw coming that

72
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:46,885
Speaker 3:  might actually shake up the search market. There's other stuff

73
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:50,725
Speaker 3:  happening underneath it that is interesting like the, the web is

74
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:54,285
Speaker 3:  being re-architected and we can talk about the deals Google and Reddit are

75
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:58,165
Speaker 3:  making. But we should just start with search GPT. David, what is going on

76
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:58,325
Speaker 3:  here?

77
00:04:58,885 --> 00:05:02,245
Speaker 4:  I guess the best way to describe search GPT is as

78
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:06,565
Speaker 4:  chat GPT. But instead of returning text that it

79
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:10,165
Speaker 4:  pulls from the internet, it returns text that it pulls from the internet

80
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:14,405
Speaker 4:  but with slightly more citations. We don't know that much.

81
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:19,045
Speaker 4:  OpenAI basically put out a, a simple blog post with a

82
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:21,565
Speaker 4:  couple of pictures. There's a text box that says what are you looking for?

83
00:05:21,585 --> 00:05:25,525
Speaker 4:  And a search GPT icon. and it will, it will attempt

84
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:29,605
Speaker 4:  to kind of return links to you when you ask a

85
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:32,925
Speaker 4:  question but also kind of make sense of them in the process. So it seems

86
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:36,325
Speaker 4:  like it's gonna do some work on like the order in which they appear and trying

87
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:39,125
Speaker 4:  to kind of tell a story with the links instead of just returning a bunch

88
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,445
Speaker 4:  of links in a row. OpenAI is being very

89
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,845
Speaker 4:  slow about this. I guess it's, I think it's gonna be open to, what was it,

90
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:51,525
Speaker 4:  10,000 users at first? Yeah. They're calling it a prototype, like

91
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:55,365
Speaker 4:  really trying to sort of slow play this thing. But we've been talking about

92
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:59,365
Speaker 4:  you know, the media deals that OpenAI has been making with our parent company,

93
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:03,125
Speaker 4:  Vox Media and The Atlantic and lots of others. We've been talking about the

94
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:07,125
Speaker 4:  ways that which OpenAI is like crawling the web and taking

95
00:06:07,155 --> 00:06:11,045
Speaker 4:  data and the all these fights over whether that is a copyright. Like all

96
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:14,565
Speaker 4:  of that I think in so many ways is actually building up to this like yes

97
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:18,565
Speaker 4:  O Chad, GPTI still believe this they opening, I

98
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:21,805
Speaker 4:  won't say it anymore because it got too popular but I sincerely believe that

99
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:25,725
Speaker 4:  chat GPT was never meant to be the thing. And I think as you

100
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:28,845
Speaker 4:  look at like the actual products OpenAI wants to build, I think it looks

101
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:32,845
Speaker 4:  a lot more like search GPT than chat GPT. And I think

102
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:35,805
Speaker 4:  like we've been building towards this for a very long time.

103
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:39,165
Speaker 3:  Wait, I I disagree with you in the most minor of ways.

104
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:39,645
Speaker 4:  Okay.

105
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:43,765
Speaker 3:  What OpenAI says it wants to build is a world conquering a GI that will put

106
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:47,365
Speaker 3:  a solid of work and let Sam Waltman live a life of endless luxury.

107
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:50,965
Speaker 4:  Sure. And he keeps writing op-ed saying it's super fine, don't even worry

108
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:51,085
Speaker 4:  about

109
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:53,605
Speaker 3:  It's fair. So that's the goal. I'll give you just to be clear, their goal

110
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:57,445
Speaker 3:  is like what if a robot did everything? Yes. And you lived in a cave running

111
00:06:57,505 --> 00:07:01,045
Speaker 3:  on a treadmill powering the robot and like f fine. You know,

112
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:05,605
Speaker 3:  maybe LLMs will get there, maybe they won't. I think they won't. But it's

113
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:09,805
Speaker 3:  like that's the big goal. Yes. The medium goal is how the hell do we

114
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:13,525
Speaker 3:  make any money? Which they have basically failed to do. There's some reporting

115
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:16,045
Speaker 3:  out there, they're in a much more tenuous financial position than they let

116
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:19,645
Speaker 3:  on, they've obviously have taken on a ton of money. They use a ton of

117
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:23,925
Speaker 3:  Azure compute all this stuff. And so you gotta make some money in

118
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:27,805
Speaker 3:  chat PD at 20 bucks a month. It just wasn't the thing. So a

119
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:31,605
Speaker 3:  search product, if you look at the history of companies that make an awful

120
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:35,365
Speaker 3:  lot of money, the search company seems to be making an awful lot of money

121
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:39,485
Speaker 3:  and they're headed towards, so I, I think this is just like a middle step

122
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:43,365
Speaker 3:  of like how do we fund our like world conquering a GI dreams.

123
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:47,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That they're currently spending a lot of money on search

124
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:50,365
Speaker 5:  GBT. Yeah. They're paying for publisher deals, they're paying for training

125
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:54,325
Speaker 5:  these models. They're not making any money off of the people who are going

126
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:57,725
Speaker 5:  to be using search GPT. That's going to be even more money in the whole as

127
00:07:57,725 --> 00:08:01,365
Speaker 5:  they get there. I I, I think you're right. Like there's a very clear

128
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:02,565
Speaker 5:  monetization model for this,

129
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:07,885
Speaker 5:  but in the short term it's, it's rough for them.

130
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:12,405
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And you know the idea that they will capture, I dunno, Google ad Sense

131
00:08:12,465 --> 00:08:16,205
Speaker 3:  ads or whatever that like advertisers will pay for opening

132
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:19,765
Speaker 3:  AI search product instead of who know, who knows. But I, the,

133
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,485
Speaker 3:  the piece of the puzzle where you might move one user from using

134
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,725
Speaker 3:  Google to using search GPT is the first problem

135
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:32,645
Speaker 3:  which like Microsoft has not solved in over a decade. Yeah. And like

136
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,405
Speaker 3:  the European Union has like tried to legislate a solution to getting

137
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:38,445
Speaker 3:  people to stop using Google and they can't solve it.

138
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:41,685
Speaker 5:  I mean it's funny because this is like, it's day one zero people are currently

139
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:45,645
Speaker 5:  using this. Maybe a few thousand will be by the end of the week.

140
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,445
Speaker 5:  This is a really, really small step. But this is also the sort of

141
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:54,285
Speaker 5:  explosive moment that everybody's been waiting for. Right.

142
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:58,685
Speaker 5:  Microsoft was so excited by this technology, they aggressively

143
00:08:58,735 --> 00:09:02,725
Speaker 5:  shoehorned it into Bing. Google was so scared of this technology that

144
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:06,325
Speaker 5:  they put some sort of disastrous AI results

145
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:08,245
Speaker 5:  directly into the front page of Google.

146
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:13,245
Speaker 5:  All of the major players are fearful of what's going to happen with chat

147
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:15,405
Speaker 5:  GPT and now we finally see the product and

148
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:20,205
Speaker 5:  you know, it's very, it's very, very alpha. Yeah.

149
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:23,805
Speaker 4:  That's such a good summation of the entirety of the AI product

150
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:27,885
Speaker 4:  industry right now. Everybody is either super bullish of it

151
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,685
Speaker 4:  or terrified of it depending on where you fall in this sort of current power

152
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:35,885
Speaker 4:  stack of the tech industry. And all of the products are just,

153
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:40,725
Speaker 4:  they're there, they're products. And I think the search thing

154
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:43,645
Speaker 4:  is so interesting to me because on the one hand, You can make a pretty compelling

155
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:47,365
Speaker 4:  argument that Google has never been more fragile than it is right now. Right?

156
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:51,005
Speaker 4:  Like it has had all these own goals in a row with all the AI overviews.

157
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:54,765
Speaker 4:  There is this wide perception that Google search is getting worse and worse

158
00:09:54,785 --> 00:09:58,245
Speaker 4:  and worse. It's getting overrun by ads on and on and on. You could argue

159
00:09:58,315 --> 00:10:01,405
Speaker 4:  that the regulation is coming forward in a real way, like Google search might

160
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:05,165
Speaker 4:  be more beatable than it has been in 20 years. And

161
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:09,125
Speaker 4:  yet there is exactly no indication that anyone is making

162
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:11,565
Speaker 4:  any kind of a dent into Google at all.

163
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,885
Speaker 3:  In fact, there's the opposite indication. Correct. They just had their financial

164
00:10:14,885 --> 00:10:15,645
Speaker 3:  results and they're,

165
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:16,405
Speaker 4:  Google just keeps winning.

166
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,885
Speaker 3:  They just made $85 billion for the past three months, a

167
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,525
Speaker 3:  14% increase over the last year. Like do Google

168
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:27,605
Speaker 5:  Do something really interesting in how they've set up the

169
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,765
Speaker 5:  main search GPT screen though? Because Google I think for the past couple

170
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:34,565
Speaker 5:  years has been like the way people search is changing, people are using

171
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:38,525
Speaker 5:  TikTok, they're asking full questions and yet Google has not really

172
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:42,845
Speaker 5:  responded to that. Google search still functions exactly the same way. This

173
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:46,365
Speaker 5:  is a really small change. But the main search

174
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:50,405
Speaker 5:  GPT screen, instead of being like a thin little box where you're supposed

175
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:54,125
Speaker 5:  to type in three keywords, it's a large text box and it says what are you

176
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,125
Speaker 5:  looking for? And I do think there's like a small turn that they're making

177
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:01,005
Speaker 5:  there. There's almost this idea of, you know, you're supposed to ask

178
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:04,765
Speaker 5:  a full question here and expect the full answer. I do think that is

179
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:08,765
Speaker 5:  sort of a differentiator. They're sort of playing into this

180
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:12,725
Speaker 5:  idea that like we are searching in different ways now. We do need to build

181
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,965
Speaker 5:  a different product for the moment. Yeah. I dunno if this is the product,

182
00:11:16,065 --> 00:11:16,285
Speaker 5:  but

183
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:20,005
Speaker 3:  Their example search is music festivals in Boone, North Carolina in August.

184
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:22,645
Speaker 3:  Which if you type that into Google today,

185
00:11:24,145 --> 00:11:27,925
Speaker 3:  it would just be to, it would be a, it would the the SEO garbage that you're

186
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:30,765
Speaker 3:  used to, but you wouldn't get an actual answer to that query

187
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:32,165
Speaker 5:  Not, not even close.

188
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:35,245
Speaker 3:  And so what they're showing, and it, we should talk about the actual product

189
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:39,205
Speaker 3:  here, right? It's a big, they're showing the larger context window and

190
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:42,845
Speaker 3:  then you ask it a question with multiple parameters and it

191
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:46,845
Speaker 3:  answers it, right? Like the answer it provides that query is in August

192
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:49,285
Speaker 3:  there are several music festivals and events happening in BOE, North Carolina

193
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:52,965
Speaker 3:  and it has a list. All the lists, all every item in that list has a link,

194
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:57,085
Speaker 3:  which is really the thing the publishers have asked for. Nick Thompson, the

195
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:59,685
Speaker 3:  CEO of the Atlantic was just on decoder. And he is like, the thing we wanted

196
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,085
Speaker 3:  in our deal was control over how our links would be displayed and how much

197
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:05,885
Speaker 3:  of the stuff they would use. So it seems like that's what they're getting

198
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:09,765
Speaker 3:  here. And then bizarrely You can click a button on the

199
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:13,685
Speaker 3:  left rail to open a panel of links, which

200
00:12:13,685 --> 00:12:17,205
Speaker 3:  is a much more traditional search result and that you can't even get from

201
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:21,085
Speaker 3:  Google anymore. Well it's actually kind of interesting that no

202
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:24,485
Speaker 3:  one has really rethought search interfaces a long time. And in the past week

203
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,125
Speaker 3:  Bing has deeply rethought its interface. Yeah. Because they can just do whatever

204
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,285
Speaker 3:  they want. And then open AI is like, well no one has any expectations of

205
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:35,125
Speaker 3:  us. Here's a totally rethought, like what if links were a panel

206
00:12:35,665 --> 00:12:38,925
Speaker 3:  as opposed to Google, which has been stuck in the 10 Blue Links paradigm,

207
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:42,765
Speaker 3:  which they've complained to you about David. Like this is that

208
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:46,205
Speaker 3:  everyone's expectation, it's not what anybody wants anymore. But then you

209
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:47,645
Speaker 3:  change it, everyone like freaks out.

210
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:51,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean it it, it cuts both ways, right? Like the, the great

211
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:55,605
Speaker 4:  thing about being Google is that you're Google and the crappy thing

212
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:59,525
Speaker 4:  about being Google is that anytime you do anything, a gigantic

213
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:02,725
Speaker 4:  portion of your users are gonna hate it and lose their minds. It's why there's

214
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:06,285
Speaker 4:  still the buttons in Microsoft Word, right? Like the, it's the famous thing

215
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:09,605
Speaker 4:  Microsoft always says, right? They're like 1% of people use this but 1% of

216
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:12,445
Speaker 4:  people is 10 million people. Like what are we supposed to do with that? And

217
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:16,285
Speaker 4:  I think that's real. And when you don't have any market

218
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,965
Speaker 4:  share and don't have anything to lose, it's a lot easier to take swings like

219
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,845
Speaker 4:  this. That's, that's certainly true. And I think to some extent like Jake,

220
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:27,445
Speaker 4:  what you're talking about, about this idea of, you know, asking

221
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:31,005
Speaker 4:  fuller questions and getting fuller answers is real. It's only one part of

222
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:33,965
Speaker 4:  search and it's actually a pretty small part of search, but it is a real

223
00:13:33,965 --> 00:13:37,885
Speaker 4:  part of search and it is I think where all these companies sense Google is

224
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,685
Speaker 4:  weakest and most beatable. But like this Boo North Carolina thing is actually

225
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:45,485
Speaker 4:  a perfect example, right? Because all this stuff exists inside of

226
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:49,405
Speaker 4:  webpages, it's just a gigantic pain in the ass to find it. And

227
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:53,165
Speaker 4:  what we've all done for forever is you do that Google search, you

228
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:57,005
Speaker 4:  open up 10 pages and you sort of collate it yourself and you like

229
00:13:57,005 --> 00:14:00,165
Speaker 4:  make that list either in your head as you read or in a

230
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:03,565
Speaker 4:  spreadsheet or a Google Doc or an email or whatever.

231
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:07,925
Speaker 4:  This is just doing that for you, which I think is super valuable. Like one

232
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:11,845
Speaker 4:  thing I do almost all the time is sit down and

233
00:14:11,845 --> 00:14:15,765
Speaker 4:  Google like things to do near me this weekend and holy God is Google

234
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:19,485
Speaker 4:  bad at serving an answer to that question? You just hope that there is some

235
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:23,205
Speaker 4:  like local news website or Eventbrite happens to have

236
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:26,885
Speaker 4:  something. The potential for this to be good at that is

237
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:30,725
Speaker 4:  vast and very exciting. There are a lot of really interesting questions about

238
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:34,205
Speaker 4:  what it does to like publishers. 'cause you even look at some of the links

239
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:37,485
Speaker 4:  in these things. They're links directly to

240
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:42,445
Speaker 4:  the venues. They're not links to whoever did the like 10

241
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:46,485
Speaker 4:  fun music festivals in Boone this weekend that OpenAI might be pulling from.

242
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:49,605
Speaker 4:  I don't know the source of some of this data. I don't know if it's actually

243
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:54,125
Speaker 4:  parsing the individual venue websites to get the answers. I,

244
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:56,885
Speaker 4:  I don't know that it matters. I don't know that it's gonna make a difference.

245
00:14:56,885 --> 00:14:59,525
Speaker 4:  But all of that is being abstracted completely away.

246
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:04,255
Speaker 4:  Potentially better user experience. But super weird different way to

247
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:05,455
Speaker 4:  think about how the internet works.

248
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:08,895
Speaker 3:  So, so this, this is like an interesting puzzle to figure out that I'm sure

249
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:12,535
Speaker 3:  we're gonna hear more about over time because there's only two search

250
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:15,975
Speaker 3:  indexes. There's Google's, which no one's allowed to use 'cause they're Google

251
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:19,895
Speaker 3:  and then there's the Bing search index which everyone uses.

252
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:24,015
Speaker 3:  And all the alternative search engines that we've written about, that David's

253
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:27,615
Speaker 3:  written about at length, they're all kind of running on the Bing index and

254
00:15:27,615 --> 00:15:30,695
Speaker 3:  then presenting a new front end to you that is maybe more private or whatever.

255
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:34,215
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And so it's pretty obvious that OpenAI is using the big search index

256
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:37,735
Speaker 3:  mostly. 'cause Microsoft is a huge owner of OpenAI.

257
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:42,135
Speaker 5:  We asked them and they just sort of vaguely said third party

258
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:43,735
Speaker 5:  partners are power

259
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:46,975
Speaker 3:  Well. So, and but then they then there are other indexes You can use and

260
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:50,015
Speaker 3:  then there are other these publisher partners that they're paying for. Yep.

261
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:53,895
Speaker 3:  Right. So if you look at this, it's like, do you, do we think that

262
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:58,935
Speaker 3:  OpenAI is publishing app summer.com, which is not

263
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:03,215
Speaker 3:  the summer of apps for your phone, but the summer of festivals in Appalachian.

264
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:06,735
Speaker 3:  Right? Right. Like very different. Like do we think they went out and made

265
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:10,615
Speaker 3:  that deal? Are they paying Wikipedia doubtful, but are they

266
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:13,695
Speaker 3:  gonna pay the Atlantic and Vox Media and everybody like yes because we know

267
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:16,855
Speaker 3:  about those deals. So there's some weirdness here

268
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:20,815
Speaker 3:  in, well they're using Bing for the big web,

269
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:24,975
Speaker 3:  like the majority of what they do. And then they have these like priority

270
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:28,895
Speaker 3:  partners who are getting a revenue share when they appear in the

271
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:32,855
Speaker 3:  results against what revenue unclear. And you just

272
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:36,055
Speaker 3:  kinda like spiral into complexity here. And the answer is like, I just wanna

273
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:37,095
Speaker 3:  know what the music festivals are.

274
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:41,495
Speaker 5:  Are, are those publishing partners actually to help improve this product?

275
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:45,735
Speaker 5:  Or is that entirely because 'cause of copyright?

276
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:50,535
Speaker 3:  I think it's both like fully, I think it's both. And I think that is actually

277
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:54,375
Speaker 3:  echoed by what Google is doing. Like we, this

278
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:58,255
Speaker 3:  is the marker I think this week of the next evolution of

279
00:16:58,255 --> 00:17:02,215
Speaker 3:  search on the internet in a huge way. That's right. 'cause this product launched

280
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:06,215
Speaker 3:  and it's gonna become, whatever it is, Bing is redesigned and it

281
00:17:06,215 --> 00:17:09,375
Speaker 3:  is basically just showing you AI answers first.

282
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:13,135
Speaker 3:  Like you thought people were freaked out at Google AI overviews. If you look

283
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:15,615
Speaker 3:  at Bing today, it's like there are no links. It's

284
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,095
Speaker 4:  Actually structurally pretty similar to search GPT. If you

285
00:17:18,095 --> 00:17:20,655
Speaker 5:  Looked at Bing today, send us an email.

286
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,895
Speaker 3:  Right? So again, the risks of these other ones are doing, and then Google

287
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:28,375
Speaker 3:  that came out this week, Google obviously has a big deal with Reddit now

288
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,695
Speaker 3:  they're paying Reddit for results and Reddit is blocking all of the other

289
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:32,935
Speaker 3:  search engines.

290
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:35,535
Speaker 5:  I, in some ways I think this is like the craziest news item of the week.

291
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,655
Speaker 5:  Like this is, this is unheard of. Are there any other major

292
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:43,455
Speaker 5:  websites that block all search engines

293
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:44,175
Speaker 5:  as as a

294
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:45,255
Speaker 3:  Rule, but they don't block Google.

295
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,485
Speaker 5:  They, right. Well yeah, but Google's paying, right?

296
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,845
Speaker 3:  There are lots of big platforms that don't

297
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:56,645
Speaker 3:  want Google to index them because they want people in their walled garden,

298
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,845
Speaker 3:  but we don't think about the web that way.

299
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:03,445
Speaker 5:  Right. And this is, I I mean this feels like an explosive moment because

300
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:07,245
Speaker 5:  of that, right? Reddit has always felt like part of the web in a

301
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:11,285
Speaker 5:  way that I think Facebook does not, maybe that's not a fair

302
00:18:11,285 --> 00:18:14,525
Speaker 5:  assessment, but I think Reddit is at very least trying to

303
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:18,805
Speaker 5:  recontextualize what it is right now. And they see that this is

304
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:22,765
Speaker 5:  the way they're going to be profitable going forward. And so they're playing

305
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:26,645
Speaker 5:  pretty hard ball with search providers right now.

306
00:18:26,995 --> 00:18:30,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean even, even Reddit's statement to us from

307
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:35,165
Speaker 4:  Tim RAs said essentially that right? The, there was a sense that the

308
00:18:35,305 --> 00:18:38,765
Speaker 4:  denial was that this is about preferencing Google,

309
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:42,925
Speaker 4:  but very clearly what that means is actually no, we wanna give it to everybody.

310
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:46,045
Speaker 4:  It's just that everybody has to pay us the way that Google did. And

311
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:50,885
Speaker 4:  that's, that's I think going to be an increasingly common position.

312
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:55,245
Speaker 4:  And what's a bummer is that it was Google. Like I think this actually

313
00:18:55,245 --> 00:18:58,405
Speaker 4:  would've been a much more interesting test case if Reddit had blocked everybody

314
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:02,645
Speaker 4:  but DuckDuckGo because DuckDuckGo paid first. You know what I mean?

315
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:06,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And it's, it's, it's really easy to sort of tow a moral line

316
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,605
Speaker 4:  when the only search engine that matters to your business is the one that's

317
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:13,365
Speaker 4:  paying you. And so I, I think to some extent

318
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:15,805
Speaker 4:  everybody gets to kind of have their cake and eat it too here. But

319
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,925
Speaker 4:  this is the fight you're gonna see over and over from these platforms. Right?

320
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,325
Speaker 3:  What I'm saying, this is the big week in internet search. What I'm saying

321
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:25,565
Speaker 3:  is this is the week that paid search started happening.

322
00:19:25,635 --> 00:19:26,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Oh I agree with that.

323
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:29,805
Speaker 3:  Right? All these publishers are paying OpenAI to be in their search product

324
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:33,925
Speaker 3:  and they are saying to us on the record Nick Thompson on decoder saying

325
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:37,965
Speaker 3:  loudly, this is all just baby steps towards trying to force Google

326
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:39,045
Speaker 3:  to pay. Yeah.

327
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:42,925
Speaker 4:  The like tacit agreement of search, which was that I'm going to let you crawl

328
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:46,605
Speaker 4:  my data in an exchange you're going to send people to me, I think is this

329
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:49,805
Speaker 4:  is the week that broke, right? Yeah. Like that is no longer the agreement

330
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:50,405
Speaker 4:  of the internet.

331
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:54,285
Speaker 3:  We're definitively on another path now. Yeah. So you've got the

332
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:57,285
Speaker 3:  publisher, you've got open AI paying the publishers for search GPT, you've

333
00:19:57,285 --> 00:20:00,925
Speaker 3:  got Google paying Reddit and Reddit blocking all the other search engines

334
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:04,805
Speaker 3:  and you're just gonna see that continue on. And then you've got

335
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:09,005
Speaker 3:  perplexity in trouble because they built search g PT without any

336
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:12,165
Speaker 3:  of these deals and they're getting sued just straightforwardly sued. Yeah.

337
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:15,605
Speaker 3:  Conde Nast, which owns Wired and Vogue and all the other big magazines is,

338
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:19,005
Speaker 3:  is suing perplexity for scraping for scraping insights.

339
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:22,685
Speaker 3:  Well there you go. Like we're in it. We're, we're in the

340
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,205
Speaker 3:  era where accessing a website is gonna cost money for robots. Yeah.

341
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:30,925
Speaker 3:  And like I just, where the money comes out on the other end is actually up

342
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:34,725
Speaker 3:  for grabs. Right? Like only Google is making any money in scale

343
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:36,845
Speaker 3:  and search and they're making all the money. Right.

344
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:41,405
Speaker 4:  And they're making more and more all the time. Yeah. Despite

345
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:44,885
Speaker 4:  trying to screw all of that up with the AI overview stuff.

346
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:49,725
Speaker 4:  And meanwhile the other thing that's happening is the, the rage against the

347
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:53,365
Speaker 4:  AI companies who are doing this without asking permission is just getting

348
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:56,525
Speaker 4:  louder and louder and louder. Like there was a big kerfuffle around Anthropic

349
00:20:56,595 --> 00:21:00,445
Speaker 4:  this week because Kyle, Wes who runs, I Fix it,

350
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:04,645
Speaker 4:  said that Anthropics Crawler was on I Fix

351
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:07,045
Speaker 4:  it's website, I think it was a million times in a day.

352
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:11,845
Speaker 4:  And this is like, it, it's an important thing to understand. Like if you

353
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:15,605
Speaker 4:  get a million page views that costs money, like actual real

354
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:18,965
Speaker 4:  money, the bandwidth and hosting costs for that stuff is expensive.

355
00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:23,365
Speaker 4:  And to have that happening all the time, which is what these

356
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:27,285
Speaker 4:  crawlers are trying to do, not only do you have like moral feelings about

357
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:30,845
Speaker 4:  it and there are copyright questions, it literally just costs money. And

358
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:34,525
Speaker 4:  so there, there was a whole thing where they had disallowed

359
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:38,925
Speaker 4:  anthropic in it in their terms of service, but not in their robots that

360
00:21:39,045 --> 00:21:42,725
Speaker 4:  TXT file, which is this thing that has, you know, been very important for

361
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:45,605
Speaker 4:  a long time and is quickly evaporating as a part of the internet.

362
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:49,245
Speaker 4:  And so now they put that in and there's a question of like, okay, is that

363
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:53,205
Speaker 4:  gonna stop? But it seems like all of these AI companies just decided a couple

364
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:56,485
Speaker 4:  of years ago that they can just run rough shot over the internet for as long

365
00:21:56,485 --> 00:22:00,325
Speaker 4:  as they can and as aggressively as they want to and just ask a lot of

366
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:04,565
Speaker 4:  forgiveness and not permission. And I think we're, the

367
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:07,165
Speaker 4:  other thing that's happening this week is that is coming back around on them

368
00:22:07,265 --> 00:22:08,405
Speaker 4:  in a pretty serious way.

369
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:12,565
Speaker 3:  Two, two things. One Con Nast sent a cease and

370
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,525
Speaker 3:  desist to perplexity. They didn't actually sue them yet, so just clarification.

371
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:18,845
Speaker 3:  And two, I forced David to write a story about robots, salt xt and I was

372
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:20,485
Speaker 3:  the rightest decision I've ever made.

373
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:23,245
Speaker 4:  You didn't force me to write that story. You, you fucked me. I cannot believe

374
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:27,045
Speaker 4:  you were taking credit for that. That is outrageous. That's

375
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:30,525
Speaker 4:  unreal. Actually you get half credit. 'cause I was telling you about it and

376
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:32,605
Speaker 4:  you were like, you should just write that story. And then I did write that

377
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:34,405
Speaker 4:  story. So I'll give you, I'll give you half credit for that.

378
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,085
Speaker 3:  That's usually how these things go. Yeah. I'll,

379
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:37,685
Speaker 4:  I'll, I'll live with that.

380
00:22:38,585 --> 00:22:40,845
Speaker 3:  We should actually re up that story. We'll put it in the, the show notes

381
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:44,725
Speaker 3:  that deal, right? Which was about compute power. Like

382
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:49,005
Speaker 3:  this file that lives on every website called Robots txt is just

383
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:52,485
Speaker 3:  says what You can cannot scrape and who and who cannot scrape the website

384
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:56,085
Speaker 3:  or read the website or index the website. and it was there to manage

385
00:22:57,265 --> 00:23:00,645
Speaker 3:  the amount of server load that websites would have in the beginning as everyone

386
00:23:00,675 --> 00:23:04,365
Speaker 3:  sort of crawl everything. and it became very political. And now you're at

387
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:08,085
Speaker 3:  the place where perplexity, CEO is like robots.

388
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:11,245
Speaker 3:  DXT is not a legal agreement and we're crawling you anyway, but you don't

389
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:13,405
Speaker 3:  understand how the web works. So it's like a real thing that he has said

390
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:16,605
Speaker 3:  in response to some of these complaints. And it's like, well, can you explain

391
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:20,725
Speaker 3:  how you think the web works and why you're scraping these sites

392
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:23,725
Speaker 3:  that don't want your crawlers to scrape them? And that

393
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:27,885
Speaker 3:  you're right. I think there's a moral argument against AI that is like

394
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:31,845
Speaker 3:  leaking into the legal argument and the moral argument is like, go away.

395
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:36,325
Speaker 3:  And then the, the hard or the harder part is like, well maybe You can pay

396
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:40,165
Speaker 3:  enough money to overcome morals. Like that's capitalism. Yep. And

397
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:41,525
Speaker 3:  no one knows how much money that is yet.

398
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:45,285
Speaker 5:  I mean, the Atlantic might they they have right? Like there's our company.

399
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:48,045
Speaker 5:  That's what those deals are, right? This is, they're trying

400
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:50,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Candidly, I think our executives were a little jealous that we had

401
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:53,805
Speaker 3:  Nick on the show, but I can't interview my own boss. It's just not how it

402
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:56,845
Speaker 3:  works. Like nobody, nobody wants that conversation. So you're real smart.

403
00:23:57,115 --> 00:23:58,405
Speaker 3:  Like nobody wants me to do that.

404
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:04,125
Speaker 3:  But I, I think those deals are even only a couple years long.

405
00:24:04,335 --> 00:24:07,565
Speaker 3:  Right. And they're all betting on whether the times wins a lawsuit or someone

406
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:11,445
Speaker 3:  else wins a lawsuit and they get to renegotiate. But I just think like the

407
00:24:11,445 --> 00:24:15,295
Speaker 3:  bigger picture here is very much people know there should be

408
00:24:15,335 --> 00:24:19,295
Speaker 3:  a next generation search product. A bunch of companies are trying to

409
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:23,215
Speaker 3:  build them. It was 18 months ago, right? That there was the Bing launch

410
00:24:23,215 --> 00:24:26,655
Speaker 3:  powered by chat GBT and I, you know, I went to

411
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:30,855
Speaker 3:  Redmond and Nadella was like, I wanna like Google dance. That's the quote.

412
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:34,855
Speaker 3:  Whether whether I think he did make Google dance. He succeeded in

413
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:38,695
Speaker 3:  dancing. Yeah. Dancing occurred whether or not that dancing resulted

414
00:24:38,695 --> 00:24:42,455
Speaker 3:  in any additional market share for Bing remains

415
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:42,935
Speaker 3:  to be seen.

416
00:24:43,045 --> 00:24:46,775
Speaker 4:  Well what's ironic is every, I think everybody lost, right? Microsoft poured

417
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:50,455
Speaker 4:  a lot of money and time and energy into making Bing more

418
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:54,215
Speaker 4:  successful to essentially no avail. And Google

419
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:57,775
Speaker 4:  got so freaked out by it that it is blowing up its own search project. Like

420
00:24:58,325 --> 00:25:01,175
Speaker 4:  it's, it's just the worst dance of all time.

421
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:04,335
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I'm the one, you one who's usually got there being like competition's

422
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:08,255
Speaker 3:  good for consumers. And in this case I'm like, what's that? Is, has this

423
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:08,575
Speaker 3:  gotten

424
00:25:08,735 --> 00:25:11,695
Speaker 5:  Anywhere? I enjoyed the AI overviews. I thought we got a good chuckle

425
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:15,695
Speaker 5:  before they started hiding them more often. Yes.

426
00:25:15,695 --> 00:25:18,295
Speaker 3:  There's the studies out there that say they don't even show them anymore.

427
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:22,055
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. There is. They're, I mean Google has fought this, but they, they,

428
00:25:22,165 --> 00:25:25,855
Speaker 5:  they appear to be reducing the frequency with which they show up

429
00:25:26,555 --> 00:25:29,775
Speaker 5:  and that that feels right. From my experience, I feel like I was seeing them

430
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:33,535
Speaker 5:  on just about everything and now either I've mentally blocked them out or

431
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:35,495
Speaker 5:  they're reducing them and I don't know which it is.

432
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:38,855
Speaker 3:  So I just did the search for music festivals in Boone, North Carolina and

433
00:25:38,855 --> 00:25:42,255
Speaker 3:  it that is something where you would expect an AI overview, nothing,

434
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,495
Speaker 3:  just didn't get one. Yeah. And yeah, it's random. That's a sample of one

435
00:25:46,495 --> 00:25:50,415
Speaker 3:  that I ran twice, but like they are, they do see me coming and going and

436
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:54,295
Speaker 3:  they cost more money than the normal search to execute to run

437
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:58,295
Speaker 3:  the inference. So we'll see. But I, this just feels like,

438
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:01,655
Speaker 3:  oh, this the, the way we think about the internet, which is like you just

439
00:26:01,655 --> 00:26:05,095
Speaker 3:  search for stuff, it's going away, like just fully going away.

440
00:26:05,435 --> 00:26:05,655
Speaker 3:  But

441
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:09,535
Speaker 4:  I, I I, I mostly agree with that, but I do think the thing I'm most

442
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:13,335
Speaker 4:  interested about with search GPT is we are at this place

443
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:17,415
Speaker 4:  now where everyone is assuming This

444
00:26:17,415 --> 00:26:20,655
Speaker 4:  is the future. Right. But it is, it is very much not

445
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:24,975
Speaker 4:  the present. Like I think the, the, the thing that Prova

446
00:26:25,215 --> 00:26:28,455
Speaker 4:  Raghavan who runs search at Google said about people going on TikTok is like,

447
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:32,535
Speaker 4:  you say that because you don't want regulators to yell at you, right? Like

448
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:35,775
Speaker 4:  it's everybody invents competition that they don't have. Like TikTok is not

449
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:39,575
Speaker 4:  search competition for Google, it just isn't. It might be, it's a really

450
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:43,805
Speaker 4:  interesting different way of thinking about the future, but it

451
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:44,685
Speaker 4:  is, it is not,

452
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:48,765
Speaker 5:  I do feel like there is something here though, like to, to your point earlier,

453
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:52,165
Speaker 5:  David, you said, you know, normally on Google you would go and you would

454
00:26:52,165 --> 00:26:55,725
Speaker 5:  read 10 results and you average them in your head and then these tools just

455
00:26:55,725 --> 00:26:59,205
Speaker 5:  average them for you. And those are the kinds of things where I have been

456
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:03,085
Speaker 5:  trying to use Chachi bt to see if I can get that

457
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:03,885
Speaker 5:  sort of quick summary.

458
00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:09,245
Speaker 5:  And because the Google product has gotten

459
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:13,485
Speaker 5:  so disastrously messy in recent years, I don't feel

460
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:17,045
Speaker 5:  like I'm missing out. Right. I I, the accuracy threat

461
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:21,325
Speaker 5:  is not really a, a thing I'm unhappy to deal

462
00:27:21,325 --> 00:27:21,485
Speaker 5:  with.

463
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:27,085
Speaker 5:  So I do think like things are changing. I don't, they certainly have not

464
00:27:27,085 --> 00:27:30,805
Speaker 5:  changed wholesale yet, but I think it's coming. No,

465
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:34,685
Speaker 4:  I, I agree with that. And I think too, Google's credit with things like

466
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:39,245
Speaker 4:  voice search and lens and the multimodal search, Google is actually like

467
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:42,205
Speaker 4:  a much more sophisticated search product than it probably gets credit for.

468
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:46,245
Speaker 4:  It's just now trying to blow all of that up with AI overviews. But I think

469
00:27:46,245 --> 00:27:50,165
Speaker 4:  to the, my larger point is we're at this moment where like all of these products

470
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:53,525
Speaker 4:  are way out in front of what they're all assuming is this big behavioral

471
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:57,285
Speaker 4:  shift and there's really no evidence yet that that

472
00:27:57,285 --> 00:28:00,285
Speaker 4:  behavioral shift is happening. And so all these companies are just flushing

473
00:28:00,285 --> 00:28:03,005
Speaker 4:  money down the toilet being like, the people are coming, this is what

474
00:28:03,005 --> 00:28:03,485
Speaker 5:  Everybody wants.

475
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:08,165
Speaker 4:  And, and there was like, it's because chat GPT hit so hard.

476
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:11,245
Speaker 4:  Everybody's like, if that's gonna happen again, we can't miss it again. And

477
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:15,205
Speaker 4:  I think what we're learning is that actually chat GPT was really cool and

478
00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:19,085
Speaker 4:  really novel and we haven't really found the like

479
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:23,005
Speaker 4:  mainstream consumer use case that goes beyond, it's really

480
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:26,805
Speaker 4:  cool and really novel. Right? And like by all indications,

481
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:30,725
Speaker 4:  the the $20 a month copilot stuff and the $20 a month Gemini stuff's like

482
00:28:30,745 --> 00:28:34,565
Speaker 4:  not taking over the universe yet. There's some really interesting AI

483
00:28:34,565 --> 00:28:38,245
Speaker 4:  like it backend stuff that's happening. There's AI stuff in industry. All

484
00:28:38,245 --> 00:28:41,245
Speaker 4:  of that is cool and interesting and I think that's gonna be where all the

485
00:28:41,365 --> 00:28:45,005
Speaker 4:  interesting stuff is. But the idea of like, I as a person in the world am

486
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:48,925
Speaker 4:  going to use AI all the time, not nearly as proven as all

487
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:50,405
Speaker 4:  of these companies would like you to believe. Right?

488
00:28:50,465 --> 00:28:54,245
Speaker 3:  Did we overreact and cause a multi-billion dollar bubble because

489
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:56,525
Speaker 3:  it seemed like a computer wanted to bang you.

490
00:28:57,315 --> 00:29:01,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like is is Google going to burn down search because it thinks everyone's

491
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:03,565
Speaker 4:  going to change even though they're not actually going to change. Like I

492
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:06,165
Speaker 3:  Would, I would say in the history of the world, it seems like something wants

493
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:07,845
Speaker 3:  to bang you has caused many mistakes to happen,

494
00:29:08,545 --> 00:29:11,285
Speaker 4:  But also most technological change, to be fair.

495
00:29:12,545 --> 00:29:13,325
Speaker 3:  So there's that.

496
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:18,605
Speaker 3:  One thing I just wanna end with that seems important here is

497
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:22,645
Speaker 3:  search. GPT is a search product that runs on

498
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:26,485
Speaker 3:  Microsoft's cloud infrastructure and Bing is a search

499
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:30,525
Speaker 3:  product that runs on Microsoft's cloud infrastructure and makes use

500
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:33,685
Speaker 3:  of open ai, which runs in like, what is going on here? Are these,

501
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:37,285
Speaker 3:  it does not seem like these companies are as tightly linked as they used

502
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:37,485
Speaker 3:  to be.

503
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:41,565
Speaker 5:  I don't know. I mean I I feel like if you had to

504
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:45,565
Speaker 5:  ask Microsoft to pick one, they're gonna pick Azure over everything else.

505
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:46,445
Speaker 5:  It's like

506
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:48,565
Speaker 3:  My my one true. Right?

507
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:49,885
Speaker 5:  No, it's like, it's the cloud.

508
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:53,005
Speaker 3:  This is like Hulk Hogan ripping over the American flag to shut Trump's face.

509
00:29:53,005 --> 00:29:53,325
Speaker 3:  Exactly.

510
00:29:53,955 --> 00:29:57,925
Speaker 5:  It's all Azure. It was always Azure. This is what

511
00:29:57,925 --> 00:30:01,445
Speaker 5:  they care about. They don't care if it's them or somebody else. and it is

512
00:30:01,445 --> 00:30:03,125
Speaker 5:  not like they have a lot to lose with Bing.

513
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:07,685
Speaker 3:  It's true. It's just, I would say after the big opening

514
00:30:07,985 --> 00:30:11,325
Speaker 3:  iku and you know, Nadella being like, Sam's my guy, he's, back

515
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:15,045
Speaker 3:  then there was Apple might join the board and that went away.

516
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:19,525
Speaker 3:  Microsoft did this weird acquihire of inflection where they have a new CEO

517
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:23,045
Speaker 3:  of ai, which is weird. And they hired an entire

518
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:27,045
Speaker 3:  AI company's worth of engineers. And then Nadella hasn't really said anything

519
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:30,845
Speaker 3:  about Open, like every other tweet from Nadella used to be about how

520
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:34,125
Speaker 3:  cool open AI was. Yeah. And Alex Heath has pointed out to me, Nadella hasn't

521
00:30:34,705 --> 00:30:36,485
Speaker 3:  not one post about open ai. Do,

522
00:30:36,505 --> 00:30:39,365
Speaker 5:  Do you, do you think he's, he's upset about their product direction or just

523
00:30:39,365 --> 00:30:42,885
Speaker 5:  worried about regulators because it feels like regulators to me, I feel like

524
00:30:43,115 --> 00:30:43,405
Speaker 5:  it's

525
00:30:43,405 --> 00:30:46,485
Speaker 3:  True. There's, there's a lot of investigation of like, did you, do you actually

526
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:50,245
Speaker 3:  secretly run a bunch of companies? Sure. But it also, their

527
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:53,525
Speaker 3:  products aren't directly competitive. Like they both have search products.

528
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:57,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And I guess the idea is, well if either one of us takes a

529
00:30:57,485 --> 00:31:00,525
Speaker 3:  percentage of share away from Google, it's still running on Azure.

530
00:31:00,795 --> 00:31:01,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I

531
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:04,685
Speaker 4:  I really think that's it. I think Jake's summation is perfect that Azure

532
00:31:04,755 --> 00:31:08,725
Speaker 4:  wins all the way down and the, the enemy is Google and whatever

533
00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:12,405
Speaker 4:  you have to do to take away from Google is fine. And I think for Microsoft,

534
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:17,085
Speaker 4:  the, we're gonna use AI to make Bing work, ship has

535
00:31:17,105 --> 00:31:21,085
Speaker 4:  sailed. And so you use Bing to like keep doing weird

536
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:24,365
Speaker 4:  stuff and keep getting press and then you hope search GPT like really wins.

537
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:28,645
Speaker 5:  We didn't touch on it, but Google was rumored to make this enormous

538
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:32,285
Speaker 5:  $23 billion purchase of a cloud security

539
00:31:32,285 --> 00:31:36,165
Speaker 5:  startup just to, you know, boost Google Cloud,

540
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:39,725
Speaker 5:  which is behind Azure, which is behind AWS.

541
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:44,085
Speaker 5:  So I think this, that is just like a huge opportunity for

542
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:47,965
Speaker 5:  Microsoft and for all of these companies and that company

543
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:52,405
Speaker 5:  spurned Google. So it's not gonna happen.

544
00:31:52,425 --> 00:31:55,645
Speaker 5:  But I think that just goes to show how important this market is. Yeah.

545
00:31:55,945 --> 00:31:59,445
Speaker 3:  Or or the CrowdStrike thing happened and Google is like, what if we aren't

546
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:01,045
Speaker 3:  responsible for things like this happen? Yeah.

547
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:01,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

548
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:06,365
Speaker 3:  It is very, by the way, it is very unclear what happens with that deal. It's

549
00:32:06,365 --> 00:32:10,205
Speaker 3:  a little far field front of our chess, but it seems like some weird, some

550
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:10,845
Speaker 3:  weirdness there.

551
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:15,205
Speaker 5:  Agreed. It wasn't clear to me. I I thought that they just were like, oh,

552
00:32:15,205 --> 00:32:18,245
Speaker 5:  we can make more money just IPO-ing capitalism. Yeah.

553
00:32:18,565 --> 00:32:22,125
Speaker 3:  Alright, we gotta take a break. Kylie Robinson wrote the whole story about

554
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:24,765
Speaker 3:  search GP It's on the website. Go read it. We'll, right back we're gonna

555
00:32:24,765 --> 00:32:25,685
Speaker 3:  talk about some gadgets

556
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:26,465
Speaker 3:  we've come,

557
00:34:29,845 --> 00:34:33,425
Speaker 3:  but Amazon's been at it for 10 years. They've sent $25 billion

558
00:34:33,765 --> 00:34:37,585
Speaker 3:  on it and they have not really made any money. The Wall Street Journal goes

559
00:34:37,615 --> 00:34:40,745
Speaker 3:  into some very boring accounting tricks

560
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:45,035
Speaker 3:  that they've used to prop up the division, but now Jeff Bezos is gone.

561
00:34:45,785 --> 00:34:49,755
Speaker 3:  Dave Limp, who used to run that whole division is gone. You got an Andy Jassy,

562
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:53,875
Speaker 3:  you got a Panos pane and they're like, what is this garbage? And

563
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:57,195
Speaker 3:  they're kind of just shutting it down. It sounds like a, a paid version of

564
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,475
Speaker 3:  Alexa is coming and that's the future.

565
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:02,835
Speaker 4:  A thing that I've learned a bunch of times over the last couple of years,

566
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,995
Speaker 4:  and for whatever reason this just keeps coming up as I talk to people about

567
00:35:05,995 --> 00:35:09,835
Speaker 4:  products, is that if you work at a big company and

568
00:35:09,935 --> 00:35:13,915
Speaker 4:  you have a product, there has to be someone really

569
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,915
Speaker 4:  high up in the company who cares about it. And without that,

570
00:35:18,695 --> 00:35:22,475
Speaker 4:  if you're not like earth shatteringly successful, your thing will die.

571
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:26,755
Speaker 4:  And this is, this is true at Google. Like if you don't have a, a

572
00:35:26,755 --> 00:35:30,115
Speaker 4:  sort of executive sponsor who can sit in a meeting and talk about why you're

573
00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:33,835
Speaker 4:  still worth the resources your product dies if you, it, it's true at Amazon.

574
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:37,245
Speaker 4:  Like I, I think one thing that we're learning about Amazon is that there

575
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:40,965
Speaker 4:  were a bunch of things that Jeff Bezos in particular really cared about.

576
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:45,165
Speaker 4:  And we've seen those things start to kind of wither on the vine after

577
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:49,005
Speaker 4:  Bezos left. And I've heard this about the Kindle, I've heard this about Alexa,

578
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:52,885
Speaker 4:  that these were things that right or wrong, good business or bad business

579
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:56,725
Speaker 4:  like Bezos really believed in as, as things

580
00:35:56,725 --> 00:36:00,005
Speaker 4:  that matter both to the world and to Amazon. And without him there

581
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:03,365
Speaker 4:  it makes sense that if you're Andy Jassy and you're looking around and you're

582
00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:06,885
Speaker 4:  saying, okay, where are we just hemorrhaging money and or wasting

583
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:10,365
Speaker 4:  resources, you could look at kind as wasting resources. It's a, it's a big

584
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:13,605
Speaker 4:  team that doesn't make that much money in the scheme vote. Amazon does. And

585
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:16,165
Speaker 4:  you look at Alexa and you're like, okay, this thing was supposed to be the

586
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:20,125
Speaker 4:  future. It's been 10 years, we've lost Not only Neli did they lose

587
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:23,805
Speaker 4:  27, 20 $5 billion, they lost $25 billion in five years.

588
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:27,845
Speaker 4:  Not even the whole run. The journal's very good reporting. Couldn't find

589
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:31,325
Speaker 4:  losses earlier than that. But presumably they were very large. Like, this

590
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:35,285
Speaker 4:  thing is a disaster of a business. And can I just read you

591
00:36:35,285 --> 00:36:39,125
Speaker 4:  what I think is some like truly great knife twisting writing from the journal?

592
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like I used to work at the Wall Street Journal. They're very careful,

593
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:45,805
Speaker 4:  they're very meticulous. They, they are not prone to like grandiose turns

594
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:49,685
Speaker 4:  of phrase. But what that means is they will just very quietly,

595
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:53,965
Speaker 4:  subtly just stab you repeatedly with a story. So it says, while

596
00:36:53,965 --> 00:36:56,805
Speaker 4:  hundreds of millions of customers have Alexa enabled devices, the idea that

597
00:36:56,805 --> 00:36:59,685
Speaker 4:  people would spend meaningful amounts of money to buy goods on Amazon by

598
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:02,445
Speaker 4:  talking to the iconic voice assistant on the underpriced speakers didn't

599
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:05,885
Speaker 4:  take off customers actually used Echo mostly for free apps such as setting

600
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:09,205
Speaker 4:  alarms and checking the weather. We're worried we've hired 10,000 people

601
00:37:09,265 --> 00:37:12,005
Speaker 4:  and we've built a smart timer set a former senior employee.

602
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:14,725
Speaker 6:  Brutal, brutal.

603
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:19,165
Speaker 4:  Ugh. But also, yes, correct. That is exactly what it's

604
00:37:19,635 --> 00:37:19,925
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

605
00:37:20,525 --> 00:37:24,245
Speaker 5:  I I I can't think of another company that operated a product division the

606
00:37:24,245 --> 00:37:28,045
Speaker 5:  way that Amazon operated the Echo division, right? For 10 years,

607
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,925
Speaker 5:  what, once a year they would roll out a dozen new echo devices and

608
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:36,285
Speaker 5:  there would just be different shapes and sizes ever. So slightly like

609
00:37:36,435 --> 00:37:40,085
Speaker 5:  weirder variations on the same thing. And, if you look back over 10 years,

610
00:37:41,065 --> 00:37:43,725
Speaker 5:  how many echo products would you say are essential?

611
00:37:44,955 --> 00:37:48,665
Speaker 5:  Right? IIII really can't think of that many different echo

612
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:52,345
Speaker 5:  products that are not just variations on the original formula that they

613
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:56,305
Speaker 5:  identified 10 years ago. And so we talk about $25 billion being

614
00:37:56,305 --> 00:38:00,225
Speaker 5:  wasted. It's like, I I don't know what they got from that. The

615
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:01,505
Speaker 5:  product just hasn't gone anywhere.

616
00:38:02,095 --> 00:38:05,065
Speaker 3:  Well I'll make this comparison, which I think is, it's a little out there,

617
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:08,785
Speaker 3:  but go with me on this. This week Meta released the latest version of

618
00:38:08,945 --> 00:38:11,465
Speaker 3:  Llama, which is open source. And Mark Zuckerberg put out this whole thing

619
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:14,625
Speaker 3:  about why he believes in open source and all this stuff. And he has this

620
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:18,225
Speaker 3:  line in there. It's like one of my formative experiences was building

621
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:21,465
Speaker 3:  products limited by what Apple would allow on its platforms. And this is

622
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,505
Speaker 3:  why I believe in open source and You can go read it straight and I'm sure

623
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:28,105
Speaker 3:  that will cause its own kind of consternation out there in the world. Amazon

624
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,865
Speaker 3:  thought this was the next platform if youll a call. They failed at the fire

625
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:35,805
Speaker 3:  phone. Yeah. Deeply badly failed at the phone. They are also

626
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:39,445
Speaker 3:  constrained by what Apple will allow them to do on their devices in meaningful

627
00:38:39,465 --> 00:38:43,205
Speaker 3:  big ways. And they really thought they had it. They really,

628
00:38:43,315 --> 00:38:46,045
Speaker 3:  okay. Ambient computing is gonna be the thing. We're gonna put a, I mean

629
00:38:46,045 --> 00:38:46,445
Speaker 3:  they got one

630
00:38:46,445 --> 00:38:47,445
Speaker 4:  In every single home

631
00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:50,965
Speaker 3:  'cause they gave away for free. Yeah. And then they, this is part of the

632
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:54,805
Speaker 3:  accounting tricks that the Wall Street Journal is talking about is they,

633
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:58,845
Speaker 3:  they accounted revenue for purchases that were like not made.

634
00:38:58,845 --> 00:39:02,725
Speaker 3:  They call it downstream impact. And like by putting an Alexa device

635
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:06,205
Speaker 3:  in your home, people will shop this much or they will stay with Prime or

636
00:39:06,405 --> 00:39:08,925
Speaker 3:  whatever it is. And they made up some money and then you're like, this is

637
00:39:09,005 --> 00:39:11,645
Speaker 3:  brilliant. There's no money. Like that didn't happen. Have

638
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:14,205
Speaker 4:  You guys ever bought something directly through your Echo?

639
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:18,165
Speaker 3:  No, actually I moved off the Alexa platform ages ago

640
00:39:19,115 --> 00:39:22,885
Speaker 3:  because I just wanted Google home frames. I wanted the photo frames on the

641
00:39:22,915 --> 00:39:26,805
Speaker 3:  hubs and Amazon finally did this. But they never built a good photo service,

642
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:30,405
Speaker 3:  which is exactly the problem you're talking about, which is the amount of

643
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:33,965
Speaker 3:  cost and complexity to build a good photo service is not worth

644
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:38,205
Speaker 3:  anything in the scheme of Amazon. Right. Google

645
00:39:38,645 --> 00:39:42,285
Speaker 3:  accidented into Google Photos, right? And they have it so they can run Google

646
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:45,845
Speaker 3:  the Nest hubs, which have the cool photo frame feature.

647
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:49,485
Speaker 3:  And I know, I know that Alexa devices have that and You can do it and da

648
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:53,045
Speaker 3:  da da da. But then you gotta use Amazon photos, which is not as good. And

649
00:39:53,045 --> 00:39:56,925
Speaker 3:  it's like, oh, is the money to improve Amazon photos worth

650
00:39:56,925 --> 00:40:00,645
Speaker 3:  it to get even 5% of people to switch away from

651
00:40:00,645 --> 00:40:04,045
Speaker 3:  Google And you just like run the math instead of Amazon. You're like, what

652
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:07,845
Speaker 3:  are you talking about? We run Amazon like figure

653
00:40:07,885 --> 00:40:10,165
Speaker 3:  out how to sell more shoes. Like stop it.

654
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:14,725
Speaker 4:  I I've been thinking a lot about the conversation we had around that very

655
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:17,805
Speaker 4:  first demo of the Humane Pin all those months ago

656
00:40:18,565 --> 00:40:21,645
Speaker 4:  when he stood there and he, he was like, I forget what he was wearing. Did

657
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:24,125
Speaker 4:  he ordered a book? He like took a picture of the book this Imran Cha the

658
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:27,365
Speaker 4:  the ceo I think this is right. He was wearing a prototype of the pen, like

659
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:30,765
Speaker 4:  took a picture of a book and bought it. And we were just sitting there be

660
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:33,485
Speaker 4:  like, okay, here's the list of questions I have about what just happened.

661
00:40:33,485 --> 00:40:36,125
Speaker 4:  What credit card did you use? Where's it shipping to? Where did you buy it

662
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:39,085
Speaker 4:  from? What's, what source is it? How much did it cost? All of that stuff

663
00:40:39,425 --> 00:40:42,925
Speaker 4:  has existed with the Echo forever. And with all of this you're like, Alexa,

664
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:46,965
Speaker 4:  you know, buy me toilet paper if I have to then go check my phone to make

665
00:40:46,965 --> 00:40:50,685
Speaker 4:  sure it worked correctly, which I do. We failed. We, we just

666
00:40:50,685 --> 00:40:54,405
Speaker 4:  accomplished nothing. And I that I think was just never

667
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:58,285
Speaker 4:  gonna work for Amazon. And and they have, they have tried to back

668
00:40:58,285 --> 00:41:01,845
Speaker 4:  their way into people wanna do this with the, you know, the, the subscribe

669
00:41:01,845 --> 00:41:05,085
Speaker 4:  and save thing has some stuff going for it and they're like, we'll reorder

670
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:09,045
Speaker 4:  the things and all that stuff and it just doesn't work. And God, this has

671
00:41:09,045 --> 00:41:12,925
Speaker 4:  to have been six years ago now. I was in Seattle in a

672
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:16,005
Speaker 4:  conference room with a bunch of Amazon executives and I made the joke about

673
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:18,845
Speaker 4:  like, okay, this thing is for music and timers. What's the third thing? Where's,

674
00:41:18,845 --> 00:41:22,005
Speaker 4:  where's my third thing gonna be? And they gave me this long speech about

675
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:25,925
Speaker 4:  how oh there are tens of thousands of things, lots of people like to do

676
00:41:25,925 --> 00:41:28,605
Speaker 4:  lots of different things. And I was like, but none of what you just described

677
00:41:28,605 --> 00:41:32,325
Speaker 4:  to me is a killer app that will make you money or

678
00:41:32,385 --> 00:41:35,085
Speaker 4:  any of these developers that you're trying to bring onto this platform. and

679
00:41:35,085 --> 00:41:38,725
Speaker 4:  it is wild to me how many years later precisely nothing has changed.

680
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:42,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like they just never found another thing. It got very good at the things

681
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:44,885
Speaker 4:  it was good at and it never found another thing,

682
00:41:45,315 --> 00:41:48,485
Speaker 3:  It's so funny 'cause there is that subscribe and save stuff. You know,

683
00:41:49,785 --> 00:41:52,365
Speaker 3:  you run out of things in your house and you should be able to be like, Alexa,

684
00:41:52,425 --> 00:41:56,165
Speaker 3:  I'm out of coffee or whatever. And they just couldn't close

685
00:41:56,265 --> 00:42:00,125
Speaker 3:  the loop in that very specific way. Or

686
00:42:00,545 --> 00:42:02,885
Speaker 3:  do you remember the dash buttons they had? Yeah. You would just like push

687
00:42:02,885 --> 00:42:05,765
Speaker 3:  the button and like laundry detergent would show up and like kids were pushing

688
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:08,965
Speaker 3:  'em too much so they got rid of 'em. They just figured out like automating

689
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:12,245
Speaker 3:  that stuff and maybe have a little too much overlap is better. And that's

690
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:15,725
Speaker 3:  how you get to subscribe and save. Like it doesn't really matter. And then

691
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:18,285
Speaker 3:  anything that you want to buy that isn't something you've already bought

692
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:21,885
Speaker 3:  a hundred times in a row, you probably wanna do an like an infinite amount

693
00:42:21,885 --> 00:42:25,685
Speaker 3:  of like product research on. And that's just better. And so like,

694
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:29,725
Speaker 3:  I think they're stuck with this product and the next move

695
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:34,165
Speaker 3:  is to put an LLM in it to charge money for it

696
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:37,685
Speaker 3:  and to have it be this thing. But to your point,

697
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:41,405
Speaker 3:  they thought this was an operating system. They thought it was a platform.

698
00:42:41,715 --> 00:42:44,565
Speaker 3:  They were licensing it out to all kinds of other companies.

699
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:48,685
Speaker 3:  They they thought they had Windows. Yeah, we've talked about it in the show.

700
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:51,765
Speaker 3:  It was like, Amazon thinks Alexa has Windows and you're like, the thing You

701
00:42:51,765 --> 00:42:53,685
Speaker 3:  can do with Windows is look at it

702
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:59,445
Speaker 3:  like, right? Like You can play games on it. Like they, they computers need

703
00:42:59,445 --> 00:43:02,525
Speaker 3:  screens. I think is like maybe the end result of all of this.

704
00:43:03,035 --> 00:43:07,005
Speaker 5:  Them planning to charge for an AI powered Alexa. It feels

705
00:43:07,005 --> 00:43:10,525
Speaker 5:  like a, a very questionable next step. Like it feels, it feels

706
00:43:10,525 --> 00:43:13,805
Speaker 5:  necessary, right? You need to charge for it. 'cause that's what everybody's

707
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:16,325
Speaker 5:  charging for the premium version of their thing. But it is, you know, after

708
00:43:16,485 --> 00:43:20,045
Speaker 5:  a decade of people being like Alexa could be a little bit better. I think

709
00:43:20,045 --> 00:43:24,005
Speaker 5:  the idea that people are like, you know what, maybe I will pay and get

710
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,085
Speaker 5:  a slightly better Alexa.

711
00:43:25,675 --> 00:43:28,365
Speaker 3:  Well just think about the horrible upsells that are coming for all of us

712
00:43:28,395 --> 00:43:32,365
Speaker 3:  with Alexa leases. Oh yeah. Right. Like even today, like you've,

713
00:43:32,455 --> 00:43:36,285
Speaker 3:  every one out of 10 times I ask Google Home to do something and it's like,

714
00:43:36,285 --> 00:43:39,365
Speaker 3:  you know, I can also do this. I'm like, I don't, I've known that for so long.

715
00:43:40,805 --> 00:43:44,725
Speaker 3:  I I don't, I don't want you to, when with Alexa it's gonna be

716
00:43:44,725 --> 00:43:48,125
Speaker 3:  like, you know, You can pay me to tell you even worse bedtime.

717
00:43:48,565 --> 00:43:52,525
Speaker 4:  That's the thing, right? So like, Jake, to your point, I think to me

718
00:43:52,545 --> 00:43:55,565
Speaker 4:  the question Amazon is about to ask is,

719
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:58,205
Speaker 4:  is 50% better Alexa

720
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,965
Speaker 4:  actually meaningful 'cause let, let's assume that it is, right? Like I think

721
00:44:02,965 --> 00:44:05,765
Speaker 4:  there's some evidence that if you go from the machine learning tech that

722
00:44:05,765 --> 00:44:09,445
Speaker 4:  we've had before to like LLM powered systems, the, like

723
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:12,805
Speaker 4:  the, the speech to text gets better, the text to speech gets better, the

724
00:44:12,805 --> 00:44:15,405
Speaker 4:  natural language processing gets better. Like most of that seems like it'll

725
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:19,045
Speaker 4:  work if Alexa just gets 50% better at every single thing. It already does.

726
00:44:19,045 --> 00:44:22,765
Speaker 4:  Does it, does it become a better product or a better business for Amazon?

727
00:44:22,885 --> 00:44:26,365
Speaker 4:  'cause I don't think so. I can't think of anything that I'm like, oh, if

728
00:44:26,365 --> 00:44:28,005
Speaker 4:  only it were better at this. I'd do it all the time.

729
00:44:29,445 --> 00:44:33,405
Speaker 5:  IIII think if you put chat GPT into Alexa, it

730
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:36,805
Speaker 5:  would get a lot more usage than it does today. I I think if you charge

731
00:44:36,985 --> 00:44:39,405
Speaker 5:  $10 a month to access chat GPT and Alexa,

732
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:42,605
Speaker 5:  you're not going to earn that much money.

733
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:46,005
Speaker 3:  Right. And this is a problem with the, it being a voice first assistant.

734
00:44:46,025 --> 00:44:49,725
Speaker 3:  If you could pay $10 a month to get chat GPT everywhere.

735
00:44:50,825 --> 00:44:54,765
Speaker 3:  Oh that's kinda interesting. Yeah. Right. But you can't, You can pay

736
00:44:54,765 --> 00:44:58,365
Speaker 3:  to get it in their app and then that app runs on your phone where

737
00:44:58,715 --> 00:44:59,525
Speaker 3:  Siri is there.

738
00:45:01,675 --> 00:45:04,205
Speaker 3:  Fine. and it does, it's not gonna run in these voice assistants in your house

739
00:45:04,325 --> 00:45:06,765
Speaker 3:  'cause Google owns them or Amazons them and you actually have this problem

740
00:45:06,765 --> 00:45:10,285
Speaker 3:  where you, you have what is fundamentally an application running

741
00:45:10,635 --> 00:45:14,525
Speaker 3:  into what many, many, many big companies have thought of

742
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:15,685
Speaker 3:  as an operating system.

743
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:19,765
Speaker 5:  I mean this is like the starting point though, right? All the grand AI dreams

744
00:45:19,825 --> 00:45:23,605
Speaker 5:  are that these AI tools can actually functionally

745
00:45:23,825 --> 00:45:27,725
Speaker 5:  do things for you, right? They can make the purchase, they can push the button,

746
00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:31,845
Speaker 5:  they can navigate an app for you. And so I, I think if

747
00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:34,965
Speaker 5:  we're talking about Alexa as an operating system, a hundred percent they

748
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:38,645
Speaker 5:  need to be working on these AI things they need to make that happen. But

749
00:45:38,645 --> 00:45:42,245
Speaker 5:  the last time somebody tried this, it was the rabbit and they sort of made

750
00:45:42,245 --> 00:45:45,445
Speaker 5:  up the fact that they could do any of these things. And so,

751
00:45:46,385 --> 00:45:50,365
Speaker 5:  you know, I I would say I don't have high hopes for V one of this, but

752
00:45:50,465 --> 00:45:54,205
Speaker 5:  it, it, it's, I think very clear that they need to do something.

753
00:45:54,395 --> 00:45:55,645
Speaker 5:  This feels like the start.

754
00:45:57,165 --> 00:46:00,725
Speaker 5:  I haven't seen it yet, but I I it it feels like this is going to be very

755
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:02,245
Speaker 5:  much first steps Yeah.

756
00:46:02,305 --> 00:46:04,485
Speaker 3:  To this. Yeah. One thing that's interesting about the journal piece, which

757
00:46:04,485 --> 00:46:08,445
Speaker 3:  is indeed very well reported and does, like David say, have many fine

758
00:46:08,445 --> 00:46:12,325
Speaker 3:  turns of phrase in it. Panos Penne who now runs this division did not speak

759
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:16,285
Speaker 3:  to them. And we, we know Panos, he is a

760
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:19,765
Speaker 3:  forceful personality. I don't think he's just gonna let it ride like

761
00:46:20,585 --> 00:46:24,285
Speaker 3:  it. See if he, if anything he will provide focus to this and it is

762
00:46:24,435 --> 00:46:28,325
Speaker 3:  unclear what that focus will be if they are gonna launch a paid tier, maybe,

763
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:31,845
Speaker 3:  you know, maybe that's his project. Maybe there's a new set of hardware coming,

764
00:46:32,585 --> 00:46:36,525
Speaker 3:  but there's another turn coming for this. It just feels like an

765
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:40,325
Speaker 3:  entire decades worth of Alexa hardware

766
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:43,845
Speaker 3:  is about to become like, huh.

767
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:47,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So what's funny about that is, I think if it weren't

768
00:46:48,225 --> 00:46:51,765
Speaker 4:  for anos, I would have just asked you just now,

769
00:46:52,265 --> 00:46:54,885
Speaker 4:  do you think it's possible that Amazon is just going to decide to get outta

770
00:46:54,885 --> 00:46:58,845
Speaker 4:  the devices business? Because what what this story is about

771
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:03,085
Speaker 4:  broadly is Amazon's devices business is a disaster.

772
00:47:04,025 --> 00:47:06,965
Speaker 4:  And there was a period not that long ago where Amazon bought Ring, Amazon

773
00:47:06,965 --> 00:47:10,565
Speaker 4:  bought, what was it? Blink It bought Eero. Yeah. It was like, it was deep

774
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:14,405
Speaker 4:  in the, we are going to be a hardware company in a very real way, especially

775
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:17,965
Speaker 4:  in the smart home. And obviously Alexa and

776
00:47:18,155 --> 00:47:22,005
Speaker 4:  Echo is the biggest part of that team as Amazon looks at it. But like,

777
00:47:22,975 --> 00:47:26,645
Speaker 4:  there don't seem to be runaway hits here, there is nothing that is like

778
00:47:26,865 --> 00:47:30,685
Speaker 4:  making all of this work. And it's the same for Kindles and Fire tv.

779
00:47:30,835 --> 00:47:33,685
Speaker 4:  Like all of this is baked into that. And so if I'm Andy Jassy and I'm like,

780
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:37,005
Speaker 4:  okay, we need to, we need to keep growing, we need to put money inside of

781
00:47:37,005 --> 00:47:40,325
Speaker 4:  the stuff that's really gonna matter. It, it doesn't seem that

782
00:47:40,415 --> 00:47:43,485
Speaker 4:  outlandish to look at devices and say this is not a game we wanna play anymore.

783
00:47:43,745 --> 00:47:47,005
Speaker 4:  But if you're gonna do that, you don't hire PAOs Penne, I don't think. And

784
00:47:47,005 --> 00:47:49,685
Speaker 4:  if you're gonna do that, I don't think Pano ISS goes to work for you. Which

785
00:47:49,685 --> 00:47:51,285
Speaker 4:  is why all of this is very confusing to me.

786
00:47:51,455 --> 00:47:55,205
Speaker 3:  Right. And there's a lot of early sort of unsourced roomy

787
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:59,085
Speaker 3:  reporting that he's like, what have you all been doing this whole

788
00:47:59,085 --> 00:47:59,245
Speaker 3:  time?

789
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:01,965
Speaker 3:  And so we'll, we'll see.

790
00:48:03,515 --> 00:48:07,365
Speaker 3:  They need a vision. Yeah. Right. The vision, you know, under Dave Limp and

791
00:48:07,365 --> 00:48:10,925
Speaker 3:  You can listen to Dave on our shows or over the years was

792
00:48:11,635 --> 00:48:15,245
Speaker 3:  your house would become a computer and he was just gonna like put microphones

793
00:48:15,245 --> 00:48:18,405
Speaker 3:  and speakers everywhere and then maybe get some satellite internet and like,

794
00:48:19,495 --> 00:48:22,405
Speaker 3:  right. 'cause he ran Project Kuper, their satellite internet that competes

795
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:23,365
Speaker 3:  with SpaceX. This is a real thing.

796
00:48:25,225 --> 00:48:28,485
Speaker 3:  And so his idea was that he would just sort of like

797
00:48:29,075 --> 00:48:32,765
Speaker 3:  smarten up your house and that would, you would just like add stuff

798
00:48:33,335 --> 00:48:34,125
Speaker 3:  until you like,

799
00:48:35,645 --> 00:48:39,175
Speaker 3:  like a black hole. Like it collapsed until it started giving up light and

800
00:48:39,175 --> 00:48:43,055
Speaker 3:  heat and became alive and turned into a computer. Like, I don't know what

801
00:48:43,055 --> 00:48:45,615
Speaker 3:  that metaphor is, but that's what it felt like. Every time I talked to him,

802
00:48:45,635 --> 00:48:48,095
Speaker 3:  he is like, here's what we're gonna do. We'll add some ring cameras and then

803
00:48:48,155 --> 00:48:51,775
Speaker 3:  ear will run the networking. We'll put a mic and a speaker in every room,

804
00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:55,695
Speaker 3:  and then you'll have a fire tv. Then we'll just keep squeezing until it's

805
00:48:55,695 --> 00:48:59,535
Speaker 3:  alive. And I was always like, but when do they talk to each other? Like,

806
00:48:59,885 --> 00:49:03,615
Speaker 3:  that is the part, like the vision is like they have to do something

807
00:49:04,005 --> 00:49:07,615
Speaker 3:  that is more than the literal sum of the parts. And I don't think they ever

808
00:49:07,675 --> 00:49:08,095
Speaker 3:  got there.

809
00:49:08,435 --> 00:49:12,295
Speaker 4:  And importantly, if you're Amazon makes money at some point,

810
00:49:12,965 --> 00:49:16,775
Speaker 4:  like Amazon just keeps giving hardware away betting that once

811
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:19,015
Speaker 4:  it's in your house, they'll figure out how to make money off of it. And we

812
00:49:19,015 --> 00:49:22,975
Speaker 4:  are now pretty long into that experiment not working. And

813
00:49:23,275 --> 00:49:25,255
Speaker 4:  you kinda wonder if it's ever gonna start to work.

814
00:49:25,635 --> 00:49:29,495
Speaker 3:  It, it feels like everyone learned the wrong lesson from Apple. Right. Apple

815
00:49:29,495 --> 00:49:32,615
Speaker 3:  turned your phone into a shopping mall and like you blink in an iPhone and

816
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:36,295
Speaker 3:  Tim Cook is like that 30%. Right. But the hardware is still very

817
00:49:36,325 --> 00:49:40,135
Speaker 3:  expensive. Yeah. Amazon's like, this is the cheapest TV

818
00:49:40,195 --> 00:49:44,135
Speaker 3:  we can make. It's full of ads. Like, and it just did, they

819
00:49:44,135 --> 00:49:47,455
Speaker 3:  didn't get the, they didn't get the, the second part. All right. There are

820
00:49:47,455 --> 00:49:49,655
Speaker 3:  other gadgets to talk about. Do you wanna start with the Z fold six?

821
00:49:50,765 --> 00:49:51,055
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

822
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:52,855
Speaker 3:  That's about it. Right?

823
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:56,695
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's my, that's my level of enthusiasm. Yeah. So Jake, I, I

824
00:49:56,695 --> 00:49:59,015
Speaker 4:  wanna know what you think about this. Nila and I have talked a lot about

825
00:49:59,015 --> 00:50:02,095
Speaker 4:  folding phones and I always end up sort of defeated and sad, but I wanna

826
00:50:02,095 --> 00:50:02,575
Speaker 4:  know what you think.

827
00:50:03,855 --> 00:50:07,735
Speaker 5:  I mean, if I had a lot of extra money to spend, I

828
00:50:07,735 --> 00:50:11,615
Speaker 5:  would own like nine foldable phones and, and I would love staring

829
00:50:11,615 --> 00:50:15,215
Speaker 5:  at them. I would love dreaming about how often I'm gonna flip them open and

830
00:50:16,355 --> 00:50:20,295
Speaker 5:  use the huge inner screen. And in reality, everybody I talk to

831
00:50:20,315 --> 00:50:24,135
Speaker 5:  has a, a foldable phone, does not open them all that often.

832
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:28,765
Speaker 5:  and it, it's really interesting reading Allison's review. 'cause she's looking

833
00:50:28,765 --> 00:50:31,445
Speaker 5:  at this, she's like, this is, you know, it's a great fun. I think they've

834
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:35,005
Speaker 5:  like pretty much figured it out. You know, they, they ironed out

835
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:36,885
Speaker 5:  all but the literal crease,

836
00:50:38,505 --> 00:50:42,365
Speaker 5:  you know, it folds flat. Now the screens like touch the edges. Great.

837
00:50:43,435 --> 00:50:46,365
Speaker 5:  It's, it's a really nice looking piece of hardware. And I do think like,

838
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:51,055
Speaker 5:  we sort of got to, you know, a few years ago there was this question of,

839
00:50:51,055 --> 00:50:54,945
Speaker 5:  oh, okay, is this going to replace the standard phone? And

840
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:58,905
Speaker 5:  I think now it's very clearly, no, this is just like another offering. And

841
00:50:58,905 --> 00:51:02,865
Speaker 5:  they've gotten really good. And I think what Allison is kind of finding here,

842
00:51:02,925 --> 00:51:05,985
Speaker 5:  and, and this seems right to me from everything I've read, from everybody

843
00:51:05,985 --> 00:51:09,865
Speaker 5:  I've talked to, you have to have a use for it. You have

844
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:13,425
Speaker 5:  to specifically want this and buy this. And

845
00:51:13,425 --> 00:51:16,585
Speaker 5:  particularly given that these are like twice the price of another phone,

846
00:51:16,925 --> 00:51:18,545
Speaker 5:  you have to really want it. Yeah.

847
00:51:19,405 --> 00:51:23,345
Speaker 3:  Our old friend Dan Seaford, who's now at Google, had maybe

848
00:51:23,345 --> 00:51:27,305
Speaker 3:  the funniest reaction to David instigating what I can only describe as

849
00:51:27,305 --> 00:51:29,145
Speaker 3:  the Buc Palmer Wars of 2024.

850
00:51:31,285 --> 00:51:34,425
Speaker 3:  He was like, well, you really want us a folding phone, which is the most

851
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,065
Speaker 3:  damn thing.

852
00:51:35,065 --> 00:51:35,265
Speaker 5:  War

853
00:51:35,265 --> 00:51:39,185
Speaker 3:  Greens the most damn thing to say, oh, I'll you Dan Dan is also one

854
00:51:39,185 --> 00:51:42,625
Speaker 3:  to try to get me to use Samsung decks every day. Which we, how that went.

855
00:51:42,925 --> 00:51:46,865
Speaker 3:  But his point was, you want a device for reading. What

856
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:48,985
Speaker 3:  you actually want is a folding phone that is a phone most of the time. And

857
00:51:48,985 --> 00:51:51,665
Speaker 3:  then you open it and you have a tablet and you do this thing. And it's still,

858
00:51:51,805 --> 00:51:54,905
Speaker 3:  the argument is what you really want as a tablet most of the time

859
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:59,345
Speaker 3:  tablet. But it's just, I don't think, but I don't want Android tablets are

860
00:51:59,345 --> 00:52:02,825
Speaker 3:  that compelling yet. Like Yeah. To this day. And so

861
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:07,105
Speaker 3:  Allison's point here is like, Samsung kind of has no competition here and

862
00:52:07,105 --> 00:52:10,505
Speaker 3:  they're coasting on having invented this. Yeah. And these are totally iterative

863
00:52:10,505 --> 00:52:10,985
Speaker 3:  refinements.

864
00:52:11,385 --> 00:52:14,665
Speaker 4:  I, I think, I think that's true. But I also think if you're

865
00:52:15,255 --> 00:52:18,625
Speaker 4:  Samsung, you're, you are kind of looking at Android and going like, okay,

866
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:21,585
Speaker 4:  what are you, what are you gonna do for me here? And, and we're now

867
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:26,385
Speaker 4:  on a pretty long run of Google kind of loudly talking

868
00:52:26,385 --> 00:52:29,905
Speaker 4:  about how it's investing in making stuff better for larger screens. and it

869
00:52:29,905 --> 00:52:33,745
Speaker 4:  has gotten better. Like the basic UI of a larger screen Android

870
00:52:33,745 --> 00:52:37,145
Speaker 4:  device has come a long way. It doesn't feel like

871
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:40,985
Speaker 4:  somebody just like took the edges of a jpeg and stretched it anymore. Like

872
00:52:40,985 --> 00:52:44,945
Speaker 4:  it's much better. But it's still, it doesn't feel

873
00:52:45,825 --> 00:52:49,665
Speaker 4:  meaningfully different to use the internal screen than it

874
00:52:49,665 --> 00:52:52,505
Speaker 4:  does to use the external screen. And so I think like Jake, to your point,

875
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:56,265
Speaker 4:  you get a foldable phone and what you realize is mostly what you bought is

876
00:52:56,265 --> 00:52:59,905
Speaker 4:  just a heavier phone that every once in a while you're gonna open up

877
00:53:00,165 --> 00:53:03,945
Speaker 4:  and do something with. It's not like a, every time I

878
00:53:04,005 --> 00:53:07,145
Speaker 4:  sit down to do it, I'm gonna open up the phone. This is the reason I think

879
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:09,505
Speaker 4:  flip phones are more interesting because I think to me there is a much more

880
00:53:09,505 --> 00:53:12,785
Speaker 4:  natural divide of what you do where on a flip phone. Yeah. And on a fold

881
00:53:12,785 --> 00:53:16,585
Speaker 4:  phone. I think partly just because of the way we've all used phones for so

882
00:53:16,585 --> 00:53:20,465
Speaker 4:  long, you're just gonna sit there and use it as a phone most of the time

883
00:53:20,465 --> 00:53:24,185
Speaker 4:  because all of the operating system, all of the apps, all of our

884
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:27,845
Speaker 4:  muscle memory has taught us how to use a phone like a phone. And so

885
00:53:28,435 --> 00:53:32,405
Speaker 4:  there's just the case for this larger screen just has not been made super

886
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:36,245
Speaker 4:  convincingly and Samsung does not seem to every year invent new reasons

887
00:53:36,345 --> 00:53:40,285
Speaker 4:  to make that case. Like the the sketch thing that You can do on

888
00:53:40,285 --> 00:53:43,765
Speaker 4:  there is awesome You can draw an image and it'll make that image for you

889
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:46,845
Speaker 4:  with AI terrifying for the future. Very cool.

890
00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:47,965
Speaker 3:  You

891
00:53:47,965 --> 00:53:51,085
Speaker 4:  Need like a lot of those, if you're gonna start to sell these things to people

892
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:54,325
Speaker 4:  in meaningful ways, especially for twice the price of a normal smartphone.

893
00:53:54,595 --> 00:53:58,285
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Also, it is still too tall and skinny on the outer screen, which I

894
00:53:58,285 --> 00:54:00,525
Speaker 3:  think is why people instinctively sort of open it every time.

895
00:54:01,635 --> 00:54:04,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Though, weirdly it seems like Google is heading that direction too.

896
00:54:04,385 --> 00:54:08,165
Speaker 5:  All the rumors about the Pixel nine Pro

897
00:54:08,655 --> 00:54:10,765
Speaker 5:  folds You did.

898
00:54:10,825 --> 00:54:11,765
Speaker 4:  That's really impressive.

899
00:54:12,525 --> 00:54:15,965
Speaker 5:  Hmm. Or that they're going more in this direction, which I think it's crazy.

900
00:54:16,005 --> 00:54:19,685
Speaker 5:  I I thought the old kind of wider more book like

901
00:54:19,985 --> 00:54:21,765
Speaker 5:  format was gonna be a winner.

902
00:54:22,395 --> 00:54:26,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The the Pixel eight fold. ZF

903
00:54:26,385 --> 00:54:26,805
Speaker 3:  that's

904
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:26,845
Speaker 4:  The

905
00:54:26,845 --> 00:54:30,565
Speaker 3:  One. Yeah. You can tell Google runs a company where most information is

906
00:54:30,565 --> 00:54:34,445
Speaker 3:  indexed by machines in how they care to name things.

907
00:54:36,225 --> 00:54:39,365
Speaker 3:  But it was like too wide. Like Allison has a photo in review of the one plus

908
00:54:39,365 --> 00:54:42,565
Speaker 3:  open the pixel fold and the new Galaxy Z fold six. And it's like the one

909
00:54:42,565 --> 00:54:43,645
Speaker 3:  plus open is the right

910
00:54:44,095 --> 00:54:44,885
Speaker 5:  Shape. Yeah.

911
00:54:45,555 --> 00:54:49,485
Speaker 3:  It's a phone. Like that's the answer is make it a

912
00:54:49,485 --> 00:54:53,325
Speaker 3:  phone and then You can open it to a tablet and every other one is like, it's

913
00:54:53,365 --> 00:54:56,685
Speaker 3:  a book. Right. It's a remote control. And it's like, why don't you just make

914
00:54:56,685 --> 00:55:00,205
Speaker 3:  it the size of a phone? And I get it that it's challenging 'cause you have

915
00:55:00,205 --> 00:55:03,965
Speaker 3:  to optimize the tablet on the inside and you, you're, I don't want to reopen

916
00:55:04,225 --> 00:55:08,165
Speaker 3:  the great aspect ratio debates of The Vergecast of old, but like what is

917
00:55:08,165 --> 00:55:11,325
Speaker 3:  the right aspect ratio for both of these things is kind of an open question.

918
00:55:11,595 --> 00:55:13,285
Speaker 5:  It's 16, 10. Just gonna lock it in.

919
00:55:13,615 --> 00:55:14,685
Speaker 4:  Three, two baby. Let's go

920
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:19,045
Speaker 3:  It. All right. So that's the Z fold six. You should review

921
00:55:19,705 --> 00:55:22,845
Speaker 3:  Sketch to Image is gonna, you know, probably end democracy as we know it,

922
00:55:22,845 --> 00:55:24,165
Speaker 3:  but it'll be fun while we, while we have it,

923
00:55:24,165 --> 00:55:27,605
Speaker 4:  Wait, can I just say before we move on, if you are a person who already owns

924
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:31,685
Speaker 4:  a Z fold and you're upgrading to the six, tell us why Vergecast at the

925
00:55:31,685 --> 00:55:34,485
Speaker 4:  version.com? Yeah, I, I'm like, I sincerely wanna know because there are

926
00:55:34,525 --> 00:55:37,165
Speaker 4:  a bunch of little hardware things, there are a bunch of little software things.

927
00:55:37,205 --> 00:55:40,765
Speaker 4:  I wanna know like what are the, what are the new things that make you wanna

928
00:55:40,765 --> 00:55:43,725
Speaker 4:  upgrade your foldable phone? So hit us up. Yeah.

929
00:55:44,405 --> 00:55:47,365
Speaker 3:  Let's talk about the Galaxy Ring real fast vs.

930
00:55:48,405 --> 00:55:51,125
Speaker 3:  Analysis of this is, this is an accessory for the Galaxy Watch. Not

931
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:51,565
Speaker 4:  What I expected,

932
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:53,205
Speaker 3:  Which is kind of fascinating. Yeah, yeah,

933
00:55:53,515 --> 00:55:57,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So basically the, the ring seems to have gotten the hardware

934
00:55:57,245 --> 00:56:00,725
Speaker 4:  basically right? It's light, it's thin, it lasts a long time, it doesn't

935
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:03,925
Speaker 4:  have a subscription. The charging case is great because it's a charging case

936
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:06,005
Speaker 4:  and not just like a weird puck that sits on your desk,

937
00:56:07,785 --> 00:56:11,685
Speaker 4:  but it's, it is kind of totally ancillary to

938
00:56:11,965 --> 00:56:15,925
Speaker 4:  everything. It doesn't seem to be wildly accurate

939
00:56:15,945 --> 00:56:18,685
Speaker 4:  in the way that you would hope something on your finger could be more accurate

940
00:56:18,685 --> 00:56:21,925
Speaker 4:  than something on your wrist. It does an interesting job v found of sort

941
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:25,445
Speaker 4:  of trading data collection between the watch and the ring. So it'll, it'll

942
00:56:25,565 --> 00:56:28,445
Speaker 4:  actually optimize for which device is better at collecting which kind of

943
00:56:28,445 --> 00:56:30,965
Speaker 4:  data through which sensor, which is very cool and potentially good for battery

944
00:56:30,965 --> 00:56:34,885
Speaker 4:  life. But yeah, it seems like it's, it's fine. Like if

945
00:56:34,885 --> 00:56:37,645
Speaker 4:  you don't have a watch and you wanna ring,

946
00:56:39,215 --> 00:56:43,165
Speaker 4:  it'll be fine. It won't be as good as having both. It probably

947
00:56:43,165 --> 00:56:47,045
Speaker 4:  won't even be as useful as the watch, but it'll be fine. But also, like,

948
00:56:47,385 --> 00:56:50,605
Speaker 4:  people who want smart rings probably also have smart watches. I don't know.

949
00:56:50,605 --> 00:56:54,325
Speaker 4:  So I I I land on like, this seems like a good additive thing,

950
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:58,925
Speaker 4:  but I kind of wanted more out of it. It's also extremely Samsung dependent.

951
00:56:59,235 --> 00:57:02,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I I just Googled it. I can get a Galaxy Watch six for

952
00:57:02,955 --> 00:57:06,525
Speaker 5:  half the price of the Galaxy Ring. And I think like,

953
00:57:07,035 --> 00:57:10,845
Speaker 5:  there's the question, this thing does more, we already know

954
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:14,565
Speaker 5:  people like smart watches, galaxy Watch six looks pretty good.

955
00:57:15,825 --> 00:57:19,165
Speaker 5:  It, and in these findings, right? The ring is supposed to be better

956
00:57:19,705 --> 00:57:23,285
Speaker 5:  at a bunch of different tracking for el for el stuff.

957
00:57:23,825 --> 00:57:27,685
Speaker 5:  It just wasn't So, at least for this first version, it just doesn't make

958
00:57:27,685 --> 00:57:28,285
Speaker 5:  a lot of sense.

959
00:57:29,955 --> 00:57:33,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah. As much as like the discrete form factor could be nice for people who,

960
00:57:33,585 --> 00:57:35,885
Speaker 5:  you know, wanna wear other stuff on their wrists. Yeah.

961
00:57:36,425 --> 00:57:39,885
Speaker 3:  Can I ask if you are deeply in the Galaxy

962
00:57:39,885 --> 00:57:43,645
Speaker 3:  ecosystem, can you talk to us? This is like every now and again, I ask for

963
00:57:43,645 --> 00:57:47,525
Speaker 3:  people who are like d who buy like gaming Android

964
00:57:47,525 --> 00:57:50,845
Speaker 3:  phones. Yeah. No one's ever called us. I just wanna be clear, may and may

965
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:54,405
Speaker 3:  look not all audiences as we as we know it's a fractured media landscape.

966
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:58,085
Speaker 3:  Maybe hardcore Android gamers don't listen to The Vergecast. But I suspect

967
00:57:58,145 --> 00:58:00,885
Speaker 3:  if anyone would have that audience, it would be us

968
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:06,605
Speaker 3:  reveal yourselves. And if you're hardcore in the Galaxy ecosystem,

969
00:58:06,705 --> 00:58:10,125
Speaker 3:  if you're like, we know about our iOS fanboy, right? There are people who

970
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:13,805
Speaker 3:  are like, I now that iPhone has RCSI believe in

971
00:58:14,025 --> 00:58:16,045
Speaker 3:  rrc s like we know who you are,

972
00:58:16,305 --> 00:58:18,765
Speaker 4:  But we're talking like deep, like if you, if you don't have a

973
00:58:18,765 --> 00:58:19,565
Speaker 3:  Phone, I want that level

974
00:58:19,565 --> 00:58:22,365
Speaker 4:  Loyalty. If you don't, if you didn't buy a Galaxy book just for the connection

975
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,365
Speaker 4:  to your phone, like, I'm out, you, you're not in it enough

976
00:58:24,365 --> 00:58:27,365
Speaker 5:  If you're not using Dicks as Yeah. Your daily driver.

977
00:58:27,745 --> 00:58:31,605
Speaker 3:  I'm sure I, I know. And I, I just want, I I just wanna

978
00:58:31,605 --> 00:58:33,725
Speaker 3:  know you. I just wanna know, just

979
00:58:33,725 --> 00:58:34,125
Speaker 4:  Be your friend.

980
00:58:35,665 --> 00:58:39,405
Speaker 4:  So one thing about V'S review that really jumped out at me was, we talked

981
00:58:39,405 --> 00:58:43,365
Speaker 4:  about this after the Samsung launch, but the, the whole energy score thing,

982
00:58:43,365 --> 00:58:46,845
Speaker 4:  this idea of like collect a bunch of data and it's gonna sort of spit back

983
00:58:46,845 --> 00:58:49,885
Speaker 4:  to you, like this overall measure of how you're doing and also some information

984
00:58:49,885 --> 00:58:53,525
Speaker 4:  about how You can do better. Can I just read you a paragraph

985
00:58:53,675 --> 00:58:57,485
Speaker 4:  from her review? Yeah. Just while I'm reading damning paragraphs about companies,

986
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:01,805
Speaker 4:  she says the new energy score is also broadly accurate though the AI powered

987
00:59:01,965 --> 00:59:04,925
Speaker 4:  insights forward hit or miss after a punishing long run in 90 degree heat,

988
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:08,325
Speaker 4:  my energy score dipped 18 points the next day victory. I was told I needed

989
00:59:08,325 --> 00:59:11,565
Speaker 4:  to rest that night. I went to bed, my score jumped 16 points, blah, blah,

990
00:59:11,565 --> 00:59:15,125
Speaker 4:  blah. Except I was also told my sleep was compromised and to stop drinking

991
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:18,725
Speaker 4:  alcohol or late night eating to ensure quality sleep I don't drink. And my

992
00:59:18,725 --> 00:59:20,285
Speaker 4:  last meal was at 6:45 PM

993
00:59:22,065 --> 00:59:25,605
Speaker 4:  AI baby. That's the thing. Like all of these things that, that

994
00:59:25,635 --> 00:59:28,725
Speaker 4:  Samsung and Apple and everybody else is on this path of like, we're gonna

995
00:59:28,725 --> 00:59:32,645
Speaker 4:  collect as much data about you as we can on your

996
00:59:32,645 --> 00:59:35,885
Speaker 4:  body biometrics. We want all this stuff and we're gonna, we're gonna give

997
00:59:35,885 --> 00:59:38,845
Speaker 4:  it, we're gonna use AI to give it back to you. Right. And the more data you

998
00:59:38,845 --> 00:59:42,645
Speaker 4:  give us, the better the AI will do. I am, I am so skeptical

999
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:46,205
Speaker 4:  of the idea that these tools are going to be

1000
00:59:46,475 --> 00:59:50,165
Speaker 4:  good at reading charts and helping me understand what's going on with my

1001
00:59:50,165 --> 00:59:52,165
Speaker 4:  body and helping me try to live better. And

1002
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,005
Speaker 3:  This is the future of medicine. David.

1003
00:59:54,035 --> 00:59:57,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I also, in some episode in the last couple of weeks, ragged on

1004
00:59:58,005 --> 01:00:01,525
Speaker 4:  people who aggressively sleep track. I'm just, I really am like

1005
01:00:02,085 --> 01:00:05,205
Speaker 4:  throwing a lot of strays on this show recently. And I heard from a bunch

1006
01:00:05,205 --> 01:00:05,845
Speaker 4:  of people who were like,

1007
01:00:05,945 --> 01:00:08,085
Speaker 3:  You're just firing into the air, just seeing where the bullet

1008
01:00:08,435 --> 01:00:11,845
Speaker 4:  Down. I heard from a few people who were like, I sleep track

1009
01:00:12,035 --> 01:00:15,805
Speaker 4:  intensely and I look at my score and I care very much about it. And I, I,

1010
01:00:16,985 --> 01:00:20,845
Speaker 4:  that's all well and good, but still it's to the point of like, okay,

1011
01:00:20,905 --> 01:00:24,485
Speaker 4:  if if you're tired, go to bed earlier. Like that's, that's as

1012
01:00:24,485 --> 01:00:28,325
Speaker 4:  sophisticated as most of these tools get and there is no evidence

1013
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:31,045
Speaker 4:  in a lot of these that AI is going to make that like meaningfully better.

1014
01:00:31,145 --> 01:00:34,925
Speaker 3:  No, no, no. I use the app sleep cycle on my phone, which is a great

1015
01:00:34,975 --> 01:00:38,125
Speaker 3:  alarm clock. I pay the subscription, it's a subscription alarm clock app

1016
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:42,085
Speaker 3:  Cool. On my iPhone. It's great. and it will tell you basically

1017
01:00:42,195 --> 01:00:44,885
Speaker 3:  like astrology level correlations.

1018
01:00:47,665 --> 01:00:47,885
Speaker 4:  All

1019
01:00:47,885 --> 01:00:50,565
Speaker 3:  Right. Maybe the real, I just like haven't dug into it

1020
01:00:50,565 --> 01:00:51,405
Speaker 5:  Affecting your sleep,

1021
01:00:51,665 --> 01:00:55,485
Speaker 3:  But it's like, it, it's like, here's, first of all, it calculates a

1022
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:59,325
Speaker 3:  sleep score, which I don't even know what that is. It's 'cause by

1023
01:00:59,325 --> 01:01:02,565
Speaker 3:  listening to you, which is terrifying, and then it will just like correlate

1024
01:01:02,565 --> 01:01:05,565
Speaker 3:  it to different things. So it's like you sleep better when it's raining.

1025
01:01:05,565 --> 01:01:09,525
Speaker 3:  It's like, do I, and the craziest one is air pressure. It's

1026
01:01:09,525 --> 01:01:13,325
Speaker 3:  like, here's the air pressure and it, it's a, it's a curve with two

1027
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:17,325
Speaker 3:  peaks and there's like parts of a barometer that apparently I

1028
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:19,805
Speaker 3:  sleep better in. And I'm like, I don't know if this is real. You

1029
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:22,485
Speaker 5:  Have to optimize. It's like you're missing out.

1030
01:01:22,675 --> 01:01:26,245
Speaker 3:  This is why I've hermetically sealed my room and I adjust the air pressure

1031
01:01:26,245 --> 01:01:27,565
Speaker 3:  in my room every time. Neil just

1032
01:01:27,745 --> 01:01:30,005
Speaker 4:  Vacuum seals himself every night before bed. Now

1033
01:01:31,535 --> 01:01:35,445
Speaker 5:  Wirecutter has a great list for, for hermetically Seal the

1034
01:01:35,445 --> 01:01:35,605
Speaker 5:  room.

1035
01:01:35,755 --> 01:01:36,045
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1036
01:01:36,355 --> 01:01:38,045
Speaker 4:  It's very expensive, but it's really worth

1037
01:01:38,045 --> 01:01:38,805
Speaker 5:  It. Yeah.

1038
01:01:39,265 --> 01:01:42,725
Speaker 3:  I'm saying once you've used this app that is like astrology level

1039
01:01:42,725 --> 01:01:43,325
Speaker 3:  correlation.

1040
01:01:43,485 --> 01:01:46,285
Speaker 4:  I do like the idea, I will say of, of waking up in the morning and it's like,

1041
01:01:46,345 --> 01:01:49,965
Speaker 4:  ah, you didn't get very good sleep. That's Mercury's fault for sure. Like,

1042
01:01:49,965 --> 01:01:52,405
Speaker 4:  that would make me feel better. I would actually pay for that. Like I would,

1043
01:01:52,445 --> 01:01:55,885
Speaker 4:  I would like to outsource all of my bad sleep to someone else's problem.

1044
01:01:56,385 --> 01:01:58,965
Speaker 5:  Do that with that. I mean, I, I guess my, the, the question I have though

1045
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:02,685
Speaker 5:  is like, I don't, I don't know how much more like a doctor is going to help

1046
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:06,325
Speaker 5:  you. Right? I I I mean if you, if you discover that you actively have

1047
01:02:06,575 --> 01:02:10,245
Speaker 5:  sleep apnea, that's very serious. That's a really good thing to learn about.

1048
01:02:11,305 --> 01:02:13,925
Speaker 5:  If you just find out that you're waking up a few times in the middle of the

1049
01:02:13,925 --> 01:02:17,845
Speaker 5:  night, I don't know, like I feel like a quick Google

1050
01:02:17,845 --> 01:02:21,725
Speaker 5:  search asking your friend for some, some advice on

1051
01:02:21,725 --> 01:02:22,725
Speaker 5:  if you're partying too much. Like

1052
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:25,925
Speaker 3:  Look, rainy showers is plus 9% sleep quality for me.

1053
01:02:27,325 --> 01:02:28,765
Speaker 3:  Actually my favorite in this list is there, is there

1054
01:02:28,765 --> 01:02:29,565
Speaker 5:  A word cloud coming

1055
01:02:29,565 --> 01:02:33,485
Speaker 3:  Here? It's affected by location so it knows where you are. And I

1056
01:02:33,485 --> 01:02:37,285
Speaker 3:  will tell you that if I go to bed in Philadelphia, minus

1057
01:02:37,445 --> 01:02:40,165
Speaker 3:  26% people, I don't know what that means.

1058
01:02:43,075 --> 01:02:46,405
Speaker 3:  It's not, I've, I've often enjoyed my time in Philadelphia

1059
01:02:46,825 --> 01:02:47,245
Speaker 5:  Too much.

1060
01:02:48,005 --> 01:02:50,765
Speaker 3:  But the air pressure, I'm just showing Jake the air pressure. It's crazy.

1061
01:02:50,885 --> 01:02:51,165
Speaker 3:  I don't,

1062
01:02:51,505 --> 01:02:52,765
Speaker 5:  You you have to be careful there.

1063
01:02:53,025 --> 01:02:54,405
Speaker 3:  I'm, listen, I'm, there's a lot,

1064
01:02:54,405 --> 01:02:55,285
Speaker 5:  There's a lot of red on.

1065
01:02:55,965 --> 01:02:59,285
Speaker 3:  I am the pilot and I'm telling David he's wrong.

1066
01:03:01,385 --> 01:03:04,885
Speaker 3:  All right, we should talk one more gadget. The as rogue ally X

1067
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:09,405
Speaker 3:  10, however you want. It's whatever you want. Sean loves

1068
01:03:09,405 --> 01:03:13,205
Speaker 3:  this thing. Loves it says it's the best Windows gaming handheld there is,

1069
01:03:13,425 --> 01:03:15,085
Speaker 3:  except Windows is really bad at going

1070
01:03:15,215 --> 01:03:18,605
Speaker 4:  Right. Best Windows handheld is is like the most damning with faint praise

1071
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:23,085
Speaker 4:  thing of all time right now. But yeah, it's by

1072
01:03:23,085 --> 01:03:25,765
Speaker 3:  The way, I have to say, I think we gave all of these products sevens and

1073
01:03:25,765 --> 01:03:28,805
Speaker 3:  I feel like I need to have a stern meeting sevens

1074
01:03:29,155 --> 01:03:30,765
Speaker 4:  Because only the Vision Pro. All of

1075
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:30,925
Speaker 3:  These are

1076
01:03:30,925 --> 01:03:34,285
Speaker 4:  Sevens, right? Is that, is that right? Yeah. Only the only the Vision Pro

1077
01:03:34,285 --> 01:03:37,125
Speaker 4:  deserves a seven. Nothing else, but

1078
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:41,125
Speaker 3:  We give one seven a year and it's the most damning seven we can get.

1079
01:03:41,185 --> 01:03:41,725
Speaker 3:  That's my,

1080
01:03:41,885 --> 01:03:42,845
Speaker 4:  I love that. For us, that's

1081
01:03:42,845 --> 01:03:43,205
Speaker 3:  The new rule.

1082
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:47,245
Speaker 4:  But yeah, the, the rub on most

1083
01:03:47,755 --> 01:03:51,685
Speaker 4:  windows handheld gaming is that it's bad. Like

1084
01:03:51,865 --> 01:03:54,885
Speaker 4:  the upside is that it's windows, so it runs everything. The downside is that

1085
01:03:54,885 --> 01:03:57,805
Speaker 4:  it's windows, so it ruins everything. Like that's, it's honestly that simple.

1086
01:03:58,235 --> 01:04:02,005
Speaker 4:  This one kudos to Jesus, like the, the, it's

1087
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:05,925
Speaker 4:  fast. The battery life is pretty good. The it, the fan is not super

1088
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:09,285
Speaker 4:  loud. It has a variable refreshed screen that Sean really liked.

1089
01:04:10,385 --> 01:04:13,805
Speaker 4:  The downside is still windows. It is just not

1090
01:04:14,635 --> 01:04:18,365
Speaker 4:  optimized to run well on a screen like this. But I will say

1091
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:22,605
Speaker 4:  we had a whole conversation two weeks ago on the show with Sean

1092
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:26,565
Speaker 4:  and Kranz, because I am like deep in a buying debate with

1093
01:04:26,565 --> 01:04:30,245
Speaker 4:  myself about which portable console to buy. And they kind of were like, it's

1094
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:34,125
Speaker 4:  the steam deck unless the the rug LIX can be great.

1095
01:04:35,185 --> 01:04:37,885
Speaker 4:  It kind of seems great. Like this kind of seems like the one, it's, it's

1096
01:04:37,885 --> 01:04:40,485
Speaker 4:  a little finicky because it's windows, but it'll play all your games and

1097
01:04:40,485 --> 01:04:44,325
Speaker 4:  it'll play them all pretty well. and it will last a long time. Like as

1098
01:04:44,325 --> 01:04:46,085
Speaker 4:  Windows goes. That's it. This

1099
01:04:46,085 --> 01:04:49,565
Speaker 3:  Is the key. It will play all the games, right? Sean is like, the performance

1100
01:04:49,565 --> 01:04:51,765
Speaker 3:  can play the most demanding games and the battery life is good.

1101
01:04:51,865 --> 01:04:54,605
Speaker 5:  The the other thing I'll say here is like, this is twice the price of an

1102
01:04:54,605 --> 01:04:55,245
Speaker 5:  entry. That's

1103
01:04:55,245 --> 01:04:56,765
Speaker 4:  The killer part. It's $800. This,

1104
01:04:56,765 --> 01:05:00,125
Speaker 5:  This is not the price of buying a gaming pc. Exactly. But this is like a

1105
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:02,365
Speaker 5:  pretty serious console level investment. That is

1106
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:05,965
Speaker 4:  True. It's like more than buying a PlayStation, right?

1107
01:05:05,965 --> 01:05:09,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Buying the steam deck. You're like, oh, it'd be kind of cheeky. And

1108
01:05:09,765 --> 01:05:13,165
Speaker 5:  I think this is, this is like, this is your serious gaming device. Yeah.

1109
01:05:13,595 --> 01:05:14,885
Speaker 3:  This is a commitment. But I think

1110
01:05:14,885 --> 01:05:18,485
Speaker 4:  That's okay. It like, if it, if it, if it runs as well as it seems to, like

1111
01:05:18,485 --> 01:05:22,165
Speaker 4:  Sean is a pretty demanding benchmark Oh, for sure. Of games. So when he,

1112
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:25,845
Speaker 4:  when he says he's happy, I know I'm going to be like ecstatic because Sean

1113
01:05:25,845 --> 01:05:28,925
Speaker 4:  is mad about frame rates and I'm like, this looks great to me. What are you

1114
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,245
Speaker 4:  talking about, Sean? So

1115
01:05:30,555 --> 01:05:30,845
Speaker 3:  This

1116
01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:33,965
Speaker 4:  Is why I don't review gaming handhelds, but I, I think I was very encouraged

1117
01:05:33,965 --> 01:05:37,885
Speaker 4:  by how encouraged he was even playing, what was it, Alan Wake two

1118
01:05:38,155 --> 01:05:41,405
Speaker 4:  that he said is like a bear of a game for any of these systems and seemed

1119
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:42,325
Speaker 4:  to be pretty happy with it.

1120
01:05:43,755 --> 01:05:47,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And, and the, the, as these scenes get less and less finicky over time,

1121
01:05:47,425 --> 01:05:51,205
Speaker 5:  slowly, I mean it's just making this kind of caliber of

1122
01:05:51,205 --> 01:05:55,165
Speaker 5:  gaming more accessible to people who do not want to deal with that on a full

1123
01:05:55,165 --> 01:05:56,605
Speaker 5:  fledged pc, which is great.

1124
01:05:57,865 --> 01:05:58,925
Speaker 3:  All right, we gotta take a break.

1125
01:06:00,265 --> 01:06:03,525
Speaker 4:  Are we not talking about Google's weird Chromecast thing? That's it. That's

1126
01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:06,485
Speaker 4:  all I have to say about it. Google has a weird Chromecast thing that hopefully

1127
01:06:06,485 --> 01:06:08,725
Speaker 4:  will be more powerful than a Chromecast. Yeah,

1128
01:06:08,995 --> 01:06:09,365
Speaker 5:  It's slow

1129
01:06:09,505 --> 01:06:12,605
Speaker 3:  And it's like a wedge. It's like, you know, the people who do finger skateboarding,

1130
01:06:13,155 --> 01:06:13,965
Speaker 3:  it's made for them.

1131
01:06:16,945 --> 01:06:17,805
Speaker 3:  That's what it's

1132
01:06:17,955 --> 01:06:21,245
Speaker 4:  Like. Belkin is gonna make you a finger skateboard for this thing 10 minutes

1133
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:24,205
Speaker 4:  after it launches. But yeah, we don't need to talk too much about this. 'cause

1134
01:06:24,205 --> 01:06:28,165
Speaker 4:  all of this stuff is launching in two weeks basically and has just been leaked

1135
01:06:28,165 --> 01:06:31,205
Speaker 4:  to death. So we'll have many more chances to talk about this between now

1136
01:06:31,205 --> 01:06:35,165
Speaker 4:  and then. But weirdly, of all the stuff I think Google is gonna launch, if

1137
01:06:35,165 --> 01:06:38,925
Speaker 4:  they can launch a very good Google TV powered set top box,

1138
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:42,885
Speaker 4:  that might be the thing. I am specifically most excited about it. And I say

1139
01:06:42,885 --> 01:06:45,525
Speaker 4:  this to somebody who finally caved and bought an Apple TV to plug into my

1140
01:06:45,685 --> 01:06:49,445
Speaker 4:  Roku tv because I'm so tired of crappy streaming software.

1141
01:06:50,435 --> 01:06:51,805
Speaker 4:  Just give me something better, right?

1142
01:06:52,155 --> 01:06:56,085
Speaker 3:  Sony Pictures Core You can only watch four movies. Three of them are

1143
01:06:56,105 --> 01:06:58,765
Speaker 3:  in the Bad Boys series, but they're 80 megabits per second.

1144
01:06:58,905 --> 01:07:00,245
Speaker 4:  And number four is Madame Webb,

1145
01:07:01,455 --> 01:07:01,805
Speaker 3:  Which

1146
01:07:01,805 --> 01:07:03,285
Speaker 4:  Exists. I like to think in the same

1147
01:09:21,335 --> 01:09:25,135
Speaker 5:  you. Yeah. So I wanna open with Apple Maps launches on the web,

1148
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:25,735
Speaker 5:  revenge

1149
01:09:25,735 --> 01:09:29,015
Speaker 3:  Of the web. This is, we open the show with like, a web is dead. We're closing

1150
01:09:29,135 --> 01:09:31,215
Speaker 3:  it with like Apple. It has to do web stuff. Now

1151
01:09:31,445 --> 01:09:35,335
Speaker 5:  This is either monumental or just does not matter

1152
01:09:35,555 --> 01:09:39,535
Speaker 5:  at all. And I, I am not sure which it is, but there's like a thing

1153
01:09:39,535 --> 01:09:43,255
Speaker 5:  happening around Apple Maps where I am, I'm of a

1154
01:09:43,255 --> 01:09:47,015
Speaker 5:  generation, my, my, my generation believes that

1155
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:50,815
Speaker 5:  Apple Maps is garbage because that's how it was when it launched

1156
01:09:50,815 --> 01:09:54,695
Speaker 5:  in 2012. And then we kept using Google Maps because we

1157
01:09:54,735 --> 01:09:58,095
Speaker 5:  u you know, I, I've used Google Maps since its inception.

1158
01:09:58,525 --> 01:10:01,335
Speaker 5:  It's a lovely, mostly good product.

1159
01:10:02,475 --> 01:10:06,215
Speaker 5:  But I do think more and more people are using Apple Maps. It's the default

1160
01:10:06,315 --> 01:10:10,215
Speaker 5:  on the iPhone. People aren't questioning it. And by all accounts it's gotten

1161
01:10:10,215 --> 01:10:12,215
Speaker 5:  pretty darn good over the past 10 years.

1162
01:10:12,715 --> 01:10:13,935
Speaker 4:  Can I caveat that slightly?

1163
01:10:15,275 --> 01:10:15,495
Speaker 5:  Yes.

1164
01:10:15,985 --> 01:10:19,975
Speaker 4:  Apple Maps is very good at navigation. It's very like if, if you

1165
01:10:19,975 --> 01:10:22,695
Speaker 4:  put in an address and you want it to get you to that address, apple Maps

1166
01:10:22,695 --> 01:10:26,295
Speaker 4:  is very good. It's actually in a lot of ways better than Google

1167
01:10:26,445 --> 01:10:29,535
Speaker 4:  Maps, which I think has like mostly lost its mind as a navigational tool.

1168
01:10:30,715 --> 01:10:33,855
Speaker 4:  We can come back to, there are lots of other parts of a Maps app.

1169
01:10:34,465 --> 01:10:38,055
Speaker 4:  Apple Maps is trash at most of them, but it is, it is very good at

1170
01:10:38,245 --> 01:10:41,815
Speaker 4:  just like A to B directional navigation. Especially if you've watched, do

1171
01:10:41,815 --> 01:10:45,455
Speaker 4:  you guys ever use the, the Tappy Tap things? Yeah, I really like that. Not

1172
01:10:45,455 --> 01:10:49,135
Speaker 4:  because I remember what the taps do and are supposed to remind me to do,

1173
01:10:49,275 --> 01:10:52,335
Speaker 4:  but because it makes me look down at the map so that I actually remember

1174
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:56,215
Speaker 4:  where I'm going. It's just like, Hey, you have to turn soon. Look, look

1175
01:10:56,215 --> 01:10:57,295
Speaker 4:  at the screen. It's very hidden.

1176
01:10:58,035 --> 01:11:01,975
Speaker 3:  The map, the, the taps, the haptics are like the purest hidden

1177
01:11:02,155 --> 01:11:02,735
Speaker 3:  UI of all time.

1178
01:11:02,735 --> 01:11:06,335
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's like six in a row if you're supposed to turn left and like three

1179
01:11:06,425 --> 01:11:09,255
Speaker 4:  pairs of two if you're supposed to turn right. Like I really think that's

1180
01:11:09,255 --> 01:11:12,215
Speaker 4:  what it is. I cannot figure it out. I just take like my, my wrist starts

1181
01:11:12,215 --> 01:11:15,245
Speaker 4:  making noises at me, at me and I'm like, oh yeah, you, it's crap.

1182
01:11:16,395 --> 01:11:19,445
Speaker 4:  It's like no one cares enough to figure this out, but Sorry Jake, continue.

1183
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:23,885
Speaker 5:  No. So I, I, so now it's on the web, right? It is on the,

1184
01:11:24,185 --> 01:11:28,165
Speaker 5:  the platform that is, it is accessible to everyone. So before now, it's

1185
01:11:28,165 --> 01:11:31,485
Speaker 5:  not that Apple Maps was available on the web in some very limited ways, right?

1186
01:11:31,685 --> 01:11:35,405
Speaker 5:  They had an API developers could pay for it and embed it into

1187
01:11:35,405 --> 01:11:38,605
Speaker 5:  their tools. I believe the infatuation uses it for all of their

1188
01:11:39,565 --> 01:11:43,525
Speaker 5:  restaurant maps. Duck, duck go, all the duck duck Go. Heads

1189
01:11:43,525 --> 01:11:47,485
Speaker 5:  out there know this, it powers Duck Duck go's maps. So it

1190
01:11:47,485 --> 01:11:51,405
Speaker 5:  is not like it wasn't available, but there was no maps.apple.com

1191
01:11:51,665 --> 01:11:54,365
Speaker 5:  and now there is, don't go to that address 'cause it might be slightly different,

1192
01:11:54,425 --> 01:11:58,405
Speaker 5:  but you know, it is on the web. You can use it. And if you're sick and

1193
01:11:58,405 --> 01:12:01,845
Speaker 5:  tired of Google Maps, which I'm sure some people are

1194
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:06,165
Speaker 5:  You can switch to Apple. And I think as they, I think

1195
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:10,045
Speaker 5:  inevitably try to turn this into a services business,

1196
01:12:10,345 --> 01:12:14,285
Speaker 5:  the fact that it's on the web is going to matter. So it's not clear to me

1197
01:12:14,715 --> 01:12:18,365
Speaker 5:  that overnight anybody's gonna switch their bookmark from Google Maps to

1198
01:12:18,365 --> 01:12:22,205
Speaker 5:  Apple Maps on the web, but it feels pretty important that they

1199
01:12:22,355 --> 01:12:26,325
Speaker 5:  have brought this to the web eventually so that it is on, you know, the biggest

1200
01:12:26,685 --> 01:12:27,285
Speaker 5:  platform in the world.

1201
01:12:27,705 --> 01:12:29,445
Speaker 4:  Can I give you my Galaxy brand take on this?

1202
01:12:29,635 --> 01:12:29,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1203
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:34,165
Speaker 4:  So Google Maps is fundamentally

1204
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:38,685
Speaker 4:  a search engine, right? Like it is, it is a, it's a local listing

1205
01:12:38,785 --> 01:12:41,725
Speaker 4:  of places. That's actually the thing about Google Maps that is the best.

1206
01:12:41,785 --> 01:12:45,725
Speaker 4:  It has all the places, it has pictures, it has reviews,

1207
01:12:45,985 --> 01:12:49,285
Speaker 4:  it as a, as a database of local things. It is pretty much

1208
01:12:49,395 --> 01:12:53,325
Speaker 4:  unmatched. Apple is awful at that. It has a Yelp integration that

1209
01:12:53,325 --> 01:12:56,565
Speaker 4:  everybody really hates. It's just Apple is not good at that.

1210
01:12:57,425 --> 01:13:00,645
Speaker 4:  But that's where all the money is in maps, right? Like You can be a data

1211
01:13:00,885 --> 01:13:04,805
Speaker 4:  provider, which, which Apple is. But if you wanna really do this and

1212
01:13:04,805 --> 01:13:08,765
Speaker 4:  do this well, you want to essentially sell ads

1213
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:13,125
Speaker 4:  in local search. And that's a big business. It's a business in which hardly

1214
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:16,165
Speaker 4:  anybody is doing a good job of competing with Google because you kind of

1215
01:13:16,165 --> 01:13:19,205
Speaker 4:  need the mapping product to do it on top of And. If you want to do that,

1216
01:13:19,705 --> 01:13:23,325
Speaker 4:  you need it to work on the web because you need it to be

1217
01:13:23,325 --> 01:13:27,285
Speaker 4:  everywhere. Because like, if I am in the car, what I want is

1218
01:13:27,285 --> 01:13:30,965
Speaker 4:  navigation, like, and I need to get somewhere. But if I'm like

1219
01:13:31,485 --> 01:13:35,365
Speaker 4:  planning things or I'm looking for places nearby, like that is

1220
01:13:35,405 --> 01:13:39,245
Speaker 4:  a, a desktop activity that you do on the web

1221
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:42,765
Speaker 4:  and this is how you get to Chromebooks. This is how you get to Windows. I

1222
01:13:42,765 --> 01:13:46,685
Speaker 4:  think like there is a maps app for Mac that I cannot imagine people

1223
01:13:46,715 --> 01:13:50,445
Speaker 4:  open ever on purpose, but this is like, this is

1224
01:13:50,755 --> 01:13:54,365
Speaker 4:  your way of becoming like a, a tool for

1225
01:13:55,245 --> 01:13:58,765
Speaker 4:  advertising and for place search way more than it is like

1226
01:13:59,665 --> 01:14:03,245
Speaker 4:  mobile web navigation. And so I think in, no, I think that's a hundred percent

1227
01:14:03,245 --> 01:14:05,165
Speaker 4:  right in that respect is a sign that this is something Apple is going to

1228
01:14:05,165 --> 01:14:08,605
Speaker 4:  start caring a lot more about as a business is super interesting to me

1229
01:14:08,985 --> 01:14:12,725
Speaker 4:  and probably bad for Yelp because you gotta kick Yelp out if you want to

1230
01:14:12,725 --> 01:14:13,045
Speaker 4:  do this well

1231
01:14:13,145 --> 01:14:16,165
Speaker 5:  And bad for Apple Maps. What, what you're fundamentally describing is they're

1232
01:14:16,165 --> 01:14:17,565
Speaker 5:  going to put a bunch of ads. I know

1233
01:14:17,925 --> 01:14:18,285
Speaker 3:  That's

1234
01:14:18,285 --> 01:14:21,325
Speaker 5:  Really true, which is is the reason that people like it right now that it

1235
01:14:21,325 --> 01:14:24,685
Speaker 5:  doesn't do that. But I, that feels like it is the inevitable direction.

1236
01:14:25,305 --> 01:14:26,885
Speaker 5:  So use it now while You can.

1237
01:14:28,425 --> 01:14:31,285
Speaker 5:  But yeah, this feels like they're teeing that up. If, and

1238
01:14:32,305 --> 01:14:35,845
Speaker 5:  you know, being available on a huge platform is, is

1239
01:14:35,935 --> 01:14:37,725
Speaker 3:  Right now I'm gonna Galaxy brand it.

1240
01:14:39,345 --> 01:14:43,195
Speaker 3:  This is, this is Apple. Knowing that

1241
01:14:43,195 --> 01:14:47,115
Speaker 3:  there's big court case about Google default search on its products

1242
01:14:48,155 --> 01:14:52,055
Speaker 3:  and that search is all going wonky and people search for places

1243
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:56,255
Speaker 3:  all the time. All the time. And the, the

1244
01:14:56,385 --> 01:15:00,215
Speaker 3:  thing after all these years, people expect maps to show up in search

1245
01:15:00,215 --> 01:15:04,015
Speaker 3:  results on the web. So you just need to get to a place where you're not

1246
01:15:04,015 --> 01:15:07,735
Speaker 3:  kicking people on their MacBooks into a weird map app

1247
01:15:08,565 --> 01:15:10,415
Speaker 3:  that You can just display a result of.

1248
01:15:10,695 --> 01:15:13,975
Speaker 4:  I thought you were gonna say, instead of taking Google's money for Safari

1249
01:15:13,975 --> 01:15:17,855
Speaker 4:  search, it was gonna take Google's money for to like power all the place

1250
01:15:18,005 --> 01:15:21,655
Speaker 4:  data in Apple maps just as a way to like make a deal while

1251
01:15:21,655 --> 01:15:25,295
Speaker 4:  sneaking around web defaults. Yeah, I like that a lot too. But I think, I

1252
01:15:25,295 --> 01:15:27,735
Speaker 4:  think you might be right, and this is, this is a hedge in a lot of ways,

1253
01:15:27,735 --> 01:15:31,655
Speaker 4:  right? Like, you have to be good at this if you want to win at any of this

1254
01:15:31,655 --> 01:15:33,215
Speaker 4:  stuff. I think that's, I think you're probably right.

1255
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:36,855
Speaker 3:  The web ain't Ted, by the way, as we have been speaking,

1256
01:15:38,035 --> 01:15:42,015
Speaker 3:  we have a little Breaking Gadget news. Patrick Spence, the CEO

1257
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:45,575
Speaker 3:  of Sonos released a letter apologizing for the

1258
01:15:45,575 --> 01:15:49,215
Speaker 3:  disastrous rollout. I will point out just some

1259
01:15:49,215 --> 01:15:52,695
Speaker 3:  chronology here. He says, we know too many of you have experienced significant

1260
01:15:52,695 --> 01:15:55,775
Speaker 3:  problems with our new app, which rolled out on May 7th. Today is

1261
01:15:55,805 --> 01:15:58,935
Speaker 3:  July 25th. So it's been a minute

1262
01:16:00,075 --> 01:16:03,655
Speaker 3:  and I want to begin, not me, this is, I'm quoting Patrick now. I don't wanna

1263
01:16:03,655 --> 01:16:06,895
Speaker 3:  apologize to you for anything Patrick says, I want to begin by personally

1264
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:10,255
Speaker 3:  apologizing for disappointing you. This, fixing the app is our number one

1265
01:16:10,495 --> 01:16:13,295
Speaker 3:  priority since May 7th. We have released new software updates approximately

1266
01:16:13,295 --> 01:16:16,895
Speaker 3:  every two weeks, each making significant, significant and meaningful improvements.

1267
01:16:16,995 --> 01:16:19,415
Speaker 3:  And they're gonna keep releasing updates every two weeks. And now they have,

1268
01:16:20,605 --> 01:16:24,175
Speaker 3:  they have a schedule. So here's, here's all the things they're gonna fix

1269
01:16:24,245 --> 01:16:28,175
Speaker 3:  over the next, every two weeks for the next several months. What a

1270
01:16:28,175 --> 01:16:28,375
Speaker 3:  mess.

1271
01:16:29,525 --> 01:16:32,655
Speaker 5:  There's only one answer here and it's that your entire

1272
01:16:33,585 --> 01:16:35,335
Speaker 5:  audio chain should be analog.

1273
01:16:36,415 --> 01:16:36,695
Speaker 3:  I agree.

1274
01:16:36,755 --> 01:16:37,855
Speaker 5:  You would have none of these issues.

1275
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:42,095
Speaker 3:  I agree. This is why I have a full vinyl setup in your as every now and

1276
01:16:42,095 --> 01:16:44,815
Speaker 3:  again, I play a record. I'm like, no one knows I'm listening to this song

1277
01:16:45,115 --> 01:16:46,255
Speaker 3:  and it is the best.

1278
01:16:47,115 --> 01:16:49,615
Speaker 5:  That's that's not true. Your phone is listening to it. That's true.

1279
01:16:49,965 --> 01:16:53,335
Speaker 3:  True. Mark Zuckerberg and the FBI are like he's listening to that again.

1280
01:16:53,435 --> 01:16:53,895
Speaker 3:  Can can

1281
01:16:53,895 --> 01:16:57,575
Speaker 4:  We just crisis comms this one for a second? Yeah. This makes no

1282
01:16:57,665 --> 01:17:01,655
Speaker 4:  sense to me because there are two things here that Patrick Spence did that

1283
01:17:01,655 --> 01:17:05,455
Speaker 4:  I think are are bonkers and nonsensical. One

1284
01:17:05,635 --> 01:17:09,135
Speaker 4:  is 10 weeks later remind

1285
01:17:09,245 --> 01:17:11,045
Speaker 4:  everybody of the stupid thing that you did,

1286
01:17:12,695 --> 01:17:16,565
Speaker 4:  which frankly many Sonos users are reminded of every day because

1287
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:20,605
Speaker 4:  the experience is a mess. Yeah. But like the Sonos initially

1288
01:17:20,605 --> 01:17:24,205
Speaker 4:  came out and talked about how it took courage to do this. Like just

1289
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:28,485
Speaker 4:  to it what an incredible million years later own goal.

1290
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:32,405
Speaker 4:  And then the other thing that he does is, is lay out the roadmap,

1291
01:17:32,405 --> 01:17:35,805
Speaker 4:  like you said for the next few months, which says among other things that

1292
01:17:35,825 --> 01:17:39,045
Speaker 4:  the alarms are not going to get better until September.

1293
01:17:39,745 --> 01:17:43,405
Speaker 4:  So now what you've said is, oh, we screwed up, we're so sorry. It's gonna

1294
01:17:43,405 --> 01:17:47,165
Speaker 4:  take two or three months before it really, really, really basic

1295
01:17:47,165 --> 01:17:51,085
Speaker 4:  things ever start to work again. And so all I'm gonna do as a

1296
01:17:51,095 --> 01:17:55,045
Speaker 4:  Sonos customer who came out of this whole period being like,

1297
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:58,805
Speaker 4:  well that sucks. Hopefully it'll get better now I'm like, oh, now

1298
01:17:58,805 --> 01:18:02,485
Speaker 4:  they're just sorry, which helps nothing. And all I know is none of this is

1299
01:18:02,685 --> 01:18:03,965
Speaker 4:  actually gonna get better anytime soon.

1300
01:18:04,745 --> 01:18:07,645
Speaker 3:  Here's what I'm gonna tell you. If you are looking for an alarm clock, You

1301
01:18:07,645 --> 01:18:11,005
Speaker 3:  can use this app called Sleep cycle, which tells me that if I get

1302
01:18:11,585 --> 01:18:15,525
Speaker 3:  6,000 steps, my sleep is green, but if I get 12,000

1303
01:18:15,525 --> 01:18:19,405
Speaker 3:  steps, it's red. But if I get 21,000 steps, it's green

1304
01:18:19,405 --> 01:18:19,645
Speaker 3:  again.

1305
01:18:19,985 --> 01:18:21,605
Speaker 5:  And you have to pay for the alarm.

1306
01:18:22,025 --> 01:18:24,285
Speaker 4:  So you have to exercise none or tons.

1307
01:18:24,955 --> 01:18:25,245
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1308
01:18:25,385 --> 01:18:27,765
Speaker 4:  But if you do like a good job disaster.

1309
01:18:28,945 --> 01:18:31,965
Speaker 3:  Hey look, they've never updated the app and made it not work. You know,

1310
01:18:32,195 --> 01:18:33,365
Speaker 4:  Does the alarm go off every

1311
01:18:33,365 --> 01:18:37,325
Speaker 3:  Morning? The alarm? It it, it's terrifying. It, it's a surveillance

1312
01:18:37,325 --> 01:18:39,925
Speaker 3:  alarm clock. It listens to you sleep, it figures out when you're coming out

1313
01:18:39,925 --> 01:18:43,165
Speaker 3:  of REM sleep and then it wakes you up so you actually wake up. I don't like

1314
01:18:43,165 --> 01:18:43,285
Speaker 3:  that.

1315
01:18:44,815 --> 01:18:48,775
Speaker 3:  I mean, look, it's terrifying and sometimes it it, it

1316
01:18:48,775 --> 01:18:52,655
Speaker 3:  claims to have recorded you talking in your sleep. Look, I'm saying

1317
01:18:52,695 --> 01:18:54,375
Speaker 3:  I. love it. It's my favorite day. Alright.

1318
01:18:55,915 --> 01:18:59,615
Speaker 3:  It is, it is my astrology. All right, leave me alone. I'll take that as,

1319
01:18:59,635 --> 01:19:01,535
Speaker 3:  as one of my lightning rounds. Dave.

1320
01:19:01,535 --> 01:19:04,615
Speaker 4:  What? Yeah, Jake, I forgot to mention that we do a lightning round in which

1321
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:08,455
Speaker 4:  we all pick one thing and then Neli picks six or seven things. That's just

1322
01:19:08,455 --> 01:19:12,335
Speaker 4:  important for you to know. The lightning round is just what Neli talks for

1323
01:19:12,335 --> 01:19:12,695
Speaker 4:  a long time.

1324
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:16,375
Speaker 5:  I, I'm honestly, I was stunned. I looked down, I'm like, sorry, NELI doesn't

1325
01:19:16,565 --> 01:19:19,335
Speaker 5:  want to complain about the 10 80 p limit

1326
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:22,015
Speaker 4:  On fl. No. He'll, we'll I'm sure we get that

1327
01:19:22,665 --> 01:19:25,975
Speaker 5:  Worry. How, how are you gonna let that opportunity go by?

1328
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:29,175
Speaker 4:  It just, yeah, I just wanted to fill you in. I know it's been a while since

1329
01:19:29,175 --> 01:19:29,695
Speaker 4:  you've been the shot.

1330
01:19:29,695 --> 01:19:29,895
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

1331
01:19:29,895 --> 01:19:33,535
Speaker 4:  No it's good. Which, oh, which the other part of that means is my lightning

1332
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:36,055
Speaker 4:  round thing only gets to take about 45 seconds because it's some point the

1333
01:19:36,055 --> 01:19:36,855
Speaker 4:  show has to end. Yeah,

1334
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:37,935
Speaker 3:  It's a lightning round. That

1335
01:19:37,935 --> 01:19:41,415
Speaker 5:  Is how, yeah, actually I'm really confused about the lightning round actually

1336
01:19:41,415 --> 01:19:41,535
Speaker 5:  being

1337
01:19:41,565 --> 01:19:44,775
Speaker 4:  It's best not to worry about it. This Yeah, it just, it just helps. Yeah,

1338
01:19:45,205 --> 01:19:46,055
Speaker 3:  It's just three things.

1339
01:19:46,165 --> 01:19:49,455
Speaker 4:  Jake. When you actually sponsor it, then You can, You can be mad about it.

1340
01:19:49,525 --> 01:19:50,375
Speaker 4:  Okay, I'm gonna

1341
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:50,775
Speaker 5:  Make it. That's

1342
01:19:50,775 --> 01:19:53,495
Speaker 3:  True. The second we get money, the whole lightning round is gonna change

1343
01:19:54,395 --> 01:19:57,615
Speaker 5:  The, we should be talking about these for no longer than 30 seconds. It should

1344
01:19:57,615 --> 01:20:00,495
Speaker 5:  be, you should, it should be debate policy style. We were just talking really,

1345
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:01,615
Speaker 5:  really, really fast to get everything

1346
01:20:01,615 --> 01:20:03,935
Speaker 3:  Through. Yeah, that's the thing is that's what you're supposed to do is get

1347
01:20:03,935 --> 01:20:06,335
Speaker 3:  through all the things as fast as we can. Got it. And somehow we got to,

1348
01:20:06,625 --> 01:20:09,885
Speaker 3:  we're just gonna all pick one and talk about them at length. Just like all

1349
01:20:09,885 --> 01:20:12,405
Speaker 3:  the other segments, which might be why it's never been sponsoring.

1350
01:20:12,645 --> 01:20:15,165
Speaker 4:  'cause as fast as we can is four or five hours do you get,

1351
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:18,525
Speaker 5:  Listen, alright, we ever, guys we can

1352
01:20:18,525 --> 01:20:20,445
Speaker 4:  Do this. No, we can't. It's impossible.

1353
01:20:20,445 --> 01:20:22,005
Speaker 3:  Wanna be clear? David, what have you got? I just

1354
01:20:22,005 --> 01:20:25,965
Speaker 4:  Want to really quickly talk about these new NBA TV deals that just

1355
01:20:25,965 --> 01:20:29,525
Speaker 4:  came out. Oh boy. We've talked a lot of the show about how sports deals are

1356
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:33,405
Speaker 4:  like a harbinger of all of what's coming in streaming. The

1357
01:20:33,445 --> 01:20:37,405
Speaker 4:  NBA just signed two or three rather new decade

1358
01:20:37,595 --> 01:20:41,565
Speaker 4:  long deals. One with Comcast, one with Disney, which are fairly

1359
01:20:41,565 --> 01:20:45,485
Speaker 4:  normal TV deals. Some streaming, some tv. But the big new

1360
01:20:45,485 --> 01:20:48,565
Speaker 4:  one was with Amazon. And there are now going to be,

1361
01:20:49,385 --> 01:20:53,245
Speaker 4:  not a ton of games, but lots of games. 66

1362
01:20:53,485 --> 01:20:56,205
Speaker 4:  a year and 20 playoff games a year on Prime video.

1363
01:20:57,205 --> 01:21:00,885
Speaker 4:  Amazon's paying almost $2 billion a year for this. It is like, this company

1364
01:21:00,945 --> 01:21:04,685
Speaker 4:  is dead serious about being a real player

1365
01:21:04,745 --> 01:21:08,645
Speaker 4:  in sports. They are all the way out on gadgets apparently.

1366
01:21:08,885 --> 01:21:12,845
Speaker 4:  Like all the, all the Alexa money is just gonna end up getting put into

1367
01:21:12,865 --> 01:21:16,805
Speaker 4:  sports rights deals because prime video seems to be the thing. They are

1368
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:20,165
Speaker 4:  like deeply committed to winning in some way, shape or form. And I just find

1369
01:21:20,165 --> 01:21:23,725
Speaker 4:  it fascinating. And yet again, the sports watching landscape gets weirder

1370
01:21:23,725 --> 01:21:27,565
Speaker 4:  and more confusing. There's gonna be TV deals.

1371
01:21:28,045 --> 01:21:31,325
Speaker 4:  ESPN is going to have its own streaming service. It's also gonna have this,

1372
01:21:31,355 --> 01:21:35,285
Speaker 4:  this venue sports thing. There's gonna be peacock,

1373
01:21:35,315 --> 01:21:38,685
Speaker 4:  there's gonna be prime video. Like God help you if you just wanna watch sports

1374
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:39,565
Speaker 4:  in the next day. I don't

1375
01:21:39,805 --> 01:21:42,325
Speaker 5:  Know a ton about the, the sports landscape

1376
01:21:44,145 --> 01:21:48,005
Speaker 5:  before all these streaming deals. Was it this fractured and splintered

1377
01:21:48,225 --> 01:21:51,085
Speaker 5:  or, or, or could you mostly get one or two channels and find these things

1378
01:21:51,305 --> 01:21:55,045
Speaker 5:  Now it feels like just to watch one league, you need to split across

1379
01:21:55,075 --> 01:21:57,965
Speaker 5:  nine different streaming services depending on the phase of the moon. No,

1380
01:21:57,965 --> 01:21:58,165
Speaker 5:  that's

1381
01:21:58,445 --> 01:22:02,285
Speaker 4:  Right. It never used to be this bad. I think the NFL was probably the

1382
01:22:02,315 --> 01:22:06,205
Speaker 4:  most spread out. And basically the way it worked was two channels

1383
01:22:06,415 --> 01:22:10,165
Speaker 4:  split Sundays and then a third channel had Sunday nights and a fourth

1384
01:22:10,165 --> 01:22:12,805
Speaker 4:  channel had Monday nights. And that was, and

1385
01:22:12,805 --> 01:22:13,325
Speaker 5:  That was the best,

1386
01:22:13,635 --> 01:22:17,565
Speaker 4:  That was the worst, like the most confusing, complicated version of

1387
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:21,405
Speaker 4:  it. Most of the time it was split between one and two

1388
01:22:21,405 --> 01:22:24,525
Speaker 4:  networks and then you throw in like regional networks for baseball. And it's

1389
01:22:24,525 --> 01:22:28,405
Speaker 4:  always been a little weird, but like right now, so I'm an Arsenal fan.

1390
01:22:28,405 --> 01:22:31,605
Speaker 4:  That's how I watch soccer. If I wanna watch every Arsenal game, I have to

1391
01:22:31,605 --> 01:22:34,325
Speaker 4:  have five networks. That's a, that's a real number.

1392
01:22:35,515 --> 01:22:39,405
Speaker 4:  It's insane. And so like, it's

1393
01:22:39,405 --> 01:22:43,285
Speaker 4:  just all of this is broken and it's because there's now so much

1394
01:22:43,285 --> 01:22:47,205
Speaker 4:  more money in sports, like the rights have gone through the roof and so

1395
01:22:47,205 --> 01:22:50,205
Speaker 4:  these traditional entertainment companies just can't afford the rights anymore.

1396
01:22:50,205 --> 01:22:53,125
Speaker 4:  Because like, I mean if you total up, so Disney is paying

1397
01:22:53,185 --> 01:22:57,005
Speaker 4:  2.6 billion annually. Comcast is paying 2.45 and Amazon is paying

1398
01:22:57,005 --> 01:23:00,845
Speaker 4:  1.93. So seven ish billion dollars. Nobody can

1399
01:23:00,845 --> 01:23:04,365
Speaker 4:  afford that on their own a year. These rights have gotten so expensive and

1400
01:23:04,365 --> 01:23:08,285
Speaker 4:  they're so important that the competition has just gone insane. And

1401
01:23:08,285 --> 01:23:11,405
Speaker 4:  the leagues, I think probably correctly are like, well we can make more money

1402
01:23:11,465 --> 01:23:15,365
Speaker 4:  by selling pieces of it to lots of people and then we will let fans

1403
01:23:16,335 --> 01:23:17,685
Speaker 4:  solve it for themselves somehow.

1404
01:23:18,425 --> 01:23:22,405
Speaker 3:  And the solution is going onto internet message

1405
01:23:22,425 --> 01:23:25,605
Speaker 3:  boards and scaling the storm seeds.

1406
01:23:26,825 --> 01:23:30,445
Speaker 3:  That's what's happening pretty much. Like eventually it's gonna get so complicated

1407
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:34,485
Speaker 3:  the revenues will come down because people, we'll see. But I agree with

1408
01:23:34,485 --> 01:23:38,245
Speaker 3:  you that Amazon is betting very highly on sports because it makes Prime

1409
01:23:38,245 --> 01:23:40,805
Speaker 3:  video stickier. It makes it feel more free

1410
01:23:42,915 --> 01:23:45,855
Speaker 3:  and it gives you like other than that, then they have to, what are they gonna

1411
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:49,575
Speaker 3:  pay for more seasons of reacher, right? Like is Homeland gonna be even more

1412
01:23:49,575 --> 01:23:50,415
Speaker 3:  evil? Well

1413
01:23:50,415 --> 01:23:51,055
Speaker 5:  And it all, it all

1414
01:23:51,055 --> 01:23:54,735
Speaker 4:  Sort of tracks, right? Like it is, it is. It does the thing for

1415
01:23:54,835 --> 01:23:58,575
Speaker 4:  Amazon that actually Alexa doesn't where like You can sell ads against

1416
01:23:58,855 --> 01:24:02,375
Speaker 4:  football that a crew back to Amazon in a very real way, right?

1417
01:24:02,445 --> 01:24:05,295
Speaker 3:  Yeah. There's a lot of AWS ads unless there's an case.

1418
01:24:05,295 --> 01:24:08,615
Speaker 4:  Exactly. In a way that all of that stuff, they wanted to connect those dots

1419
01:24:08,615 --> 01:24:11,415
Speaker 4:  with Alexa and never did. They're actually pretty well connected on Prime

1420
01:24:11,415 --> 01:24:11,695
Speaker 4:  video.

1421
01:24:12,775 --> 01:24:15,625
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But it's, it is getting insane to watch

1422
01:24:16,285 --> 01:24:16,505
Speaker 4:  It

1423
01:24:16,865 --> 01:24:20,145
Speaker 3:  Semester. Alright, here's my other one. I am gonna complain about 10 piece

1424
01:24:20,145 --> 01:24:23,425
Speaker 3:  streaming. As long as we're on the subject, I'm gonna take this opportunity.

1425
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:27,545
Speaker 3:  Disney launched the bundle of Disney plus Hulu and

1426
01:24:27,605 --> 01:24:31,425
Speaker 3:  Max. Interesting. By the way, the ESPN Plus is not part of it. Just

1427
01:24:31,585 --> 01:24:35,545
Speaker 3:  a little swap out there. Like no one cares about this sports product

1428
01:24:35,545 --> 01:24:39,465
Speaker 3:  because that's moving into the bigger bundle with the other companies.

1429
01:24:39,775 --> 01:24:43,305
Speaker 3:  Very weird. Just a lot of weird stuff going on there. None of this really

1430
01:24:43,305 --> 01:24:46,705
Speaker 3:  matters except the, the bundle is what, 29? Nine nine a month? 69.

1431
01:24:46,705 --> 01:24:50,145
Speaker 4:  9 69 9 a month with ads. 29 99 a month

1432
01:24:50,455 --> 01:24:51,185
Speaker 4:  without ads

1433
01:24:51,325 --> 01:24:55,065
Speaker 3:  For ad free. So that's cheaper. It's

1434
01:24:55,405 --> 01:24:59,385
Speaker 3:  if you were to pay all in just straight up, you'd be paying $48 a month.

1435
01:24:59,415 --> 01:25:00,985
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So it's cheaper, but

1436
01:25:02,605 --> 01:25:06,025
Speaker 3:  10 80 p two streams. And the weirdest part about this

1437
01:25:07,325 --> 01:25:11,305
Speaker 3:  is that when we ask Disney to clarify that and make it clear, they refuse

1438
01:25:11,305 --> 01:25:13,145
Speaker 3:  to answer on the record. That's so

1439
01:25:13,145 --> 01:25:13,585
Speaker 4:  Bizarre.

1440
01:25:13,815 --> 01:25:16,665
Speaker 3:  What are you doing? Like usually when we get a refuse answer on the record,

1441
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:18,345
Speaker 3:  it's like controversial. You know, it's like

1442
01:25:18,455 --> 01:25:19,385
Speaker 5:  This is controversial.

1443
01:25:19,525 --> 01:25:22,545
Speaker 3:  We have like an explosive claim and they're like, no, we're gonna see it.

1444
01:25:22,545 --> 01:25:25,505
Speaker 3:  And Disney's like, we just won't tell you it's 10 80 on the record.

1445
01:25:26,045 --> 01:25:29,865
Speaker 5:  No one wants their name attached to, to, to bit rates that low.

1446
01:25:29,965 --> 01:25:33,945
Speaker 5:  So, so we actually, we, we actually don't know. We know that Max is 10

1447
01:25:33,945 --> 01:25:37,705
Speaker 5:  80 p. Yeah, Hulu and Disney plus, they wouldn't say

1448
01:25:38,205 --> 01:25:41,905
Speaker 5:  so actually it's the Disney half of this is just stonewalling.

1449
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:45,305
Speaker 5:  The HBO half is like, ah, whatever. Yeah, like yeah,

1450
01:25:45,495 --> 01:25:46,745
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Max is like, we,

1451
01:25:47,005 --> 01:25:47,825
Speaker 5:  You don't have to care that much.

1452
01:25:48,445 --> 01:25:52,105
Speaker 3:  It is very hard. It is very expensive and very hard to get Max and 4K.

1453
01:25:52,215 --> 01:25:56,065
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You to buy Max Ultimate. And it's just ridiculously expensive and

1454
01:25:56,065 --> 01:25:58,185
Speaker 3:  nobody wants it is what I

1455
01:25:58,185 --> 01:26:00,025
Speaker 5:  Gather. It's the only streaming service I pay for.

1456
01:26:00,205 --> 01:26:02,265
Speaker 3:  You pay all the way you

1457
01:26:02,265 --> 01:26:04,725
Speaker 5:  Pay. If I'm paying for it, I want, I want all fix.

1458
01:26:05,045 --> 01:26:09,005
Speaker 4:  Wait, really? Wait Jake, be honest. Do you really, you

1459
01:26:09,005 --> 01:26:11,885
Speaker 4:  pay the whatever, $700,000 a month that it costs

1460
01:26:11,885 --> 01:26:14,565
Speaker 5:  Sarah? It's like $17. It's

1461
01:26:14,565 --> 01:26:18,205
Speaker 4:  Not, wait, no. Okay. But the reason I ask is we, we've talked a lot on this

1462
01:26:18,205 --> 01:26:21,965
Speaker 4:  show about like price elasticity

1463
01:26:22,025 --> 01:26:24,965
Speaker 4:  for 4K because my theory is they're be honest, they're just gonna charge

1464
01:26:24,965 --> 01:26:28,285
Speaker 4:  everybody who is dumb enough to pay for 4K streaming

1465
01:26:28,855 --> 01:26:31,925
Speaker 4:  until you're paying a hundred dollars a month per service or you just go

1466
01:26:31,925 --> 01:26:33,725
Speaker 4:  down to ads. Like those are gonna be the two tiers

1467
01:26:33,825 --> 01:26:37,525
Speaker 5:  To to, to be completely candid, I meant to cancel months ago

1468
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:38,085
Speaker 5:  and,

1469
01:26:39,075 --> 01:26:42,085
Speaker 4:  Okay, so you're in the neli situation where like, I paid for

1470
01:26:42,085 --> 01:26:45,285
Speaker 5:  This. I guess it, it's just, I'm like, I'm probably gonna watch something.

1471
01:26:45,565 --> 01:26:48,605
Speaker 5:  I I I'm really not sure what network is the bear on Hulu?

1472
01:26:49,105 --> 01:26:49,325
Speaker 3:  Who,

1473
01:26:49,385 --> 01:26:51,805
Speaker 5:  Who, yeah. I gotta cancel this. Yeah, it's not good.

1474
01:26:52,265 --> 01:26:55,805
Speaker 3:  I'm just saying the fact that of all of them, max, which has the best movie

1475
01:26:55,805 --> 01:26:59,645
Speaker 3:  catalog makes it the hardest to get 4K is just

1476
01:27:01,055 --> 01:27:03,245
Speaker 5:  Kills me. I watched Dune two on a plane.

1477
01:27:05,065 --> 01:27:05,925
Speaker 5:  It was pretty good.

1478
01:27:07,745 --> 01:27:09,405
Speaker 5:  It looked all right. I dunno,

1479
01:27:11,485 --> 01:27:15,325
Speaker 3:  I still have never done this, but my dream is that when we remove

1480
01:27:15,505 --> 01:27:19,405
Speaker 3:  review movies, we don't issue them scores. We issue them where and

1481
01:27:19,405 --> 01:27:20,165
Speaker 3:  when to watch. Ooh,

1482
01:27:20,165 --> 01:27:20,645
Speaker 4:  That's good.

1483
01:27:20,905 --> 01:27:23,765
Speaker 3:  Mm. Right. So like, some of them like go to the theater,

1484
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:24,845
Speaker 4:  We rate it by screen size.

1485
01:27:25,995 --> 01:27:29,805
Speaker 3:  This is 85 inch movie. Get to the theater imax, this is an IMAX movie. And

1486
01:27:29,805 --> 01:27:32,605
Speaker 3:  then you get all the way down to the end and you're like, for free on a plane

1487
01:27:32,785 --> 01:27:36,005
Speaker 3:  if you, there's nothing else, right? And like in the middle it's like, wait

1488
01:27:36,005 --> 01:27:39,325
Speaker 3:  for a tit Netflix. Like there's all these things and that is the true mark.

1489
01:27:39,545 --> 01:27:40,325
Speaker 4:  That's really good.

1490
01:27:41,075 --> 01:27:41,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

1491
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:45,645
Speaker 3:  It's on cable with ads and you're hungover fine.

1492
01:27:45,865 --> 01:27:48,365
Speaker 3:  You know, we need to come up with a scale

1493
01:27:48,945 --> 01:27:51,845
Speaker 4:  On mute in the dentist waiting room. Yeah, exactly.

1494
01:27:53,795 --> 01:27:54,365
Speaker 3:  It's fine.

1495
01:27:56,205 --> 01:28:00,005
Speaker 3:  I, we gotta figure out the one for Baywatch, which I've seen go

1496
01:28:00,005 --> 01:28:03,165
Speaker 3:  viral on Seatbacks. I just, the

1497
01:28:03,985 --> 01:28:05,565
Speaker 3:  what's the new Sydney Sweeney Glen Powell

1498
01:28:05,625 --> 01:28:07,245
Speaker 4:  One. Anyone but you, I mean,

1499
01:28:07,245 --> 01:28:08,045
Speaker 3:  I dont know anyone but you.

1500
01:28:10,205 --> 01:28:13,645
Speaker 3:  I watched that go viral on Seatbacks the last time I was on a plane. Whatever

1501
01:28:13,645 --> 01:28:17,605
Speaker 3:  that category is is the most complicated category. 'cause it's not wait

1502
01:28:17,605 --> 01:28:20,965
Speaker 3:  for a seat back. It's when it happens, it happens to everyone.

1503
01:28:21,065 --> 01:28:22,085
Speaker 4:  You know what's tough is, is

1504
01:28:22,135 --> 01:28:23,525
Speaker 3:  Which is better than wait for a seat back.

1505
01:28:23,525 --> 01:28:27,245
Speaker 4:  So I have my, my new plane gadget is the, the 13 inch

1506
01:28:27,425 --> 01:28:31,405
Speaker 4:  new iPad Pro. Very beautiful, very bright, very large.

1507
01:28:32,555 --> 01:28:36,205
Speaker 4:  Nothing like a like surprise nudity in a movie

1508
01:28:36,425 --> 01:28:40,125
Speaker 4:  on a 13 inch iPad to really make the plane ride

1509
01:28:40,275 --> 01:28:43,925
Speaker 4:  awkward for eight minutes. I just do the quick, like, fold the screen down,

1510
01:28:44,075 --> 01:28:45,645
Speaker 4:  just sort of keep an eye on it for a couple minutes.

1511
01:28:45,645 --> 01:28:46,685
Speaker 3:  It's worse than watching with your parents.

1512
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:47,285
Speaker 4:  Oh, it's

1513
01:28:47,285 --> 01:28:49,845
Speaker 5:  Awful. Got Oscar nominated. It's fine. Just

1514
01:28:51,475 --> 01:28:55,045
Speaker 4:  It's for art that's just sort of yell to the plane as it's happening. Yeah,

1515
01:28:55,955 --> 01:28:59,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah. My parents like, let's watch Oppenheimer. And I was like, this isn't

1516
01:28:59,205 --> 01:29:02,805
Speaker 3:  supposed to be here. I'm 42 years old. Okay,

1517
01:29:03,675 --> 01:29:06,245
Speaker 3:  last quasi lightning round item.

1518
01:29:07,745 --> 01:29:11,205
Speaker 3:  We have David caused the Bucs Palmer War of 2024

1519
01:29:11,985 --> 01:29:15,525
Speaker 3:  Rivian. CEO rj SC CR caused the great CarPlay debate of 2024

1520
01:29:16,185 --> 01:29:19,565
Speaker 3:  to light up. It's real light. People are writing articles, people are yelling

1521
01:29:19,965 --> 01:29:23,645
Speaker 3:  comments. David and I are holding a formal CarPlay debate

1522
01:29:25,085 --> 01:29:28,095
Speaker 3:  soon on The Vergecast. I just, I'm just letting you know, we hashed it out.

1523
01:29:28,095 --> 01:29:31,935
Speaker 3:  It's like rules and like Liam is a moderator. They got heated.

1524
01:29:31,955 --> 01:29:35,885
Speaker 3:  Did I won? I'm not telling you what side Heli called

1525
01:29:35,885 --> 01:29:37,885
Speaker 3:  me names and they hurt my feelings.

1526
01:29:40,515 --> 01:29:43,725
Speaker 3:  It's, it's a reflection of the current political environment in America.

1527
01:29:44,495 --> 01:29:48,485
Speaker 3:  Right. That's what I'm saying. All right. I think that's it. There's

1528
01:29:48,485 --> 01:29:52,365
Speaker 3:  like a lot of other stuff going on. It's a wild week. We, we, we barely

1529
01:29:52,365 --> 01:29:54,605
Speaker 3:  even talked about the other thing that happened this week in the world

1530
01:29:56,035 --> 01:29:59,465
Speaker 3:  after we received feedback on our political views last time. You mean the

1531
01:29:59,705 --> 01:30:00,385
Speaker 3:  Olympics? I don't wanna say that.

1532
01:30:02,605 --> 01:30:05,305
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna wrap this up differently. All right. That's it. There's a lot going

1533
01:30:05,305 --> 01:30:09,065
Speaker 3:  on. We have to, you know, there's a new presidential can candidate. She has

1534
01:30:09,065 --> 01:30:12,785
Speaker 3:  like a lot of tech policy views that we don't know yet. So all that's to

1535
01:30:12,785 --> 01:30:16,385
Speaker 3:  come the Olympics are starting, which also seem very difficult to stream

1536
01:30:16,385 --> 01:30:19,585
Speaker 3:  in 4K unless you have a specifically a Comcast cable box,

1537
01:30:20,205 --> 01:30:23,465
Speaker 3:  in which case you get a low latency 30 megabits per second stream.

1538
01:30:24,265 --> 01:30:27,745
Speaker 3:  Comcast is an investor in V Media. They provided me with none of, because

1539
01:30:28,365 --> 01:30:32,185
Speaker 3:  You can tell how much they care for me. I, they did not

1540
01:30:32,185 --> 01:30:35,385
Speaker 3:  install Comcast service in my house far outside of their service area to

1541
01:30:35,385 --> 01:30:38,345
Speaker 3:  just give me one of these boxes. There's a lot going on. It's all gonna be

1542
01:30:38,345 --> 01:30:41,145
Speaker 3:  on The Verge dot com. Jake, this was great. Thanks for joining us, man. Of

1543
01:30:41,145 --> 01:30:43,145
Speaker 3:  course. That's it. That's Vergecast Rock and roll.
