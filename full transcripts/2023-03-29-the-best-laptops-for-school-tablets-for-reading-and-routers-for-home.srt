Speaker 5:  answering your questions from the Vergecast hotline. 8

18
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,550
Speaker 5:  6 6 Verge 11. By the way, keep 'em coming. I wanna start with

19
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,750
Speaker 5:  this question that we got from Chris.

20
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,030
Speaker 2:  Hey Verge, my name is Chris. I'm from the US from Iowa.

21
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,430
Speaker 2:  For several years now I've been struggling to find the right balance between

22
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,150
Speaker 2:  mobile, online privacy and modern conveniences.

23
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,670
Speaker 2:  Everything you do on your phone is being tracked nowadays and it feels like

24
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,310
Speaker 2:  the more you go toward privacy, the more you compromise on convenience

25
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,150
Speaker 2:  and vice versa. My question is, what is the best approach

26
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,910
Speaker 2:  to have the best of both worlds? Is it iPhone? Is

27
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,590
Speaker 2:  Apple really the customer privacy advocate that they claim to be?

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,750
Speaker 2:  Is it a tracker blocking vpn? Is it a D Googled

29
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,630
Speaker 2:  custom Android rom like e foundation's, e os? Is it something like

30
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,550
Speaker 2:  light phone, a flip phone, no phone at all. This has been a real struggle

31
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,950
Speaker 2:  for me and I can really go on and on about it, but thank you for taking the

32
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,470
Speaker 2:  time to answer this and I really love the show. Have a good one. Bye.

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,290
Speaker 5:  I love this question and it's actually something I've been thinking a lot

34
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,210
Speaker 5:  about personally. Two things happened to me recently that made me ask a

35
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,000
Speaker 5:  lot of these same questions. First, I had my first kid in December and

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,640
Speaker 5:  suddenly had a million people asking for photos and videos and

37
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,440
Speaker 5:  information about how he's doing and a million photos and videos

38
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,280
Speaker 5:  and information about how he's doing. And two, my 2023

39
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,720
Speaker 5:  resolution was to start a personal journal again, I've written in a journal

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,680
Speaker 5:  every day of 2023 so far, which is maybe the best I've

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,960
Speaker 5:  ever done on a New Year's resolution. Honestly, I'm very proud of myself.

42
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,280
Speaker 5:  So like I said, this made me start asking questions about private spaces

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,040
Speaker 5:  and personal spaces and what it means to have stuff that

44
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,920
Speaker 5:  you care about be yours on the internet. And the thing about all this

45
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,600
Speaker 5:  is it ends up being surprisingly philosophical. Some

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,160
Speaker 5:  people are really worried about privacy and they don't wanna do anything

47
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,000
Speaker 5:  that's even remotely close to risking losing or leaking data.

48
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,200
Speaker 5:  Other people are like, well I have nothing to hide. Who cares? I don't really

49
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,520
Speaker 5:  agree with that last take and I'm not here to pick fights on any of that,

50
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,440
Speaker 5:  but let me just say this. What I know about myself is that I do things

51
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,320
Speaker 5:  differently when I have full trust that something is private, I

52
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,840
Speaker 5:  rate differently in my journal if I know that maybe someday someone

53
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,600
Speaker 5:  will see this versus I'm just gonna burn this thing and it's gonna be gone

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,520
Speaker 5:  forever. My Instagram feed and my camera roll are filled with really

55
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,080
Speaker 5:  different kinds of photos because people might see one and might not see

56
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,680
Speaker 5:  the other. The truth is we just act differently in public

57
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,560
Speaker 5:  than in private. We just do so personally, I've become worried

58
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,240
Speaker 5:  about the companies who sell my preferences and know my whereabouts. Yes,

59
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,400
Speaker 5:  but I'm maybe more interested in finding places that I can

60
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,360
Speaker 5:  trust to just be for me so that I can be completely

61
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,080
Speaker 5:  myself in all of this. There's really private spaces and there's

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,320
Speaker 5:  personal spaces. They're similar but they're not the same thing and I'm trying

63
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,160
Speaker 5:  to find both. Anyway, when I started journaling, I downloaded day one,

64
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,960
Speaker 5:  which is like the giant of the digital journaling space. I didn't want

65
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,520
Speaker 5:  a paper journal because I also like to save photos and links in my diary.

66
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,480
Speaker 5:  Plus my handwriting is borderline unreadable. My wife likes to say

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,240
Speaker 5:  I write like a serial killer. Also, I work for the Verge, I like technology.

68
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,560
Speaker 5:  So I downloaded the app, paid for day one premium and started writing

69
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,920
Speaker 5:  and I noticed a few days later that day one was storing kind of a wild

70
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,800
Speaker 5:  amount of data about me. It has all the journal entries I type obviously,

71
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,680
Speaker 5:  but it was also pulling in all my calendar events for the day, all the locations

72
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,640
Speaker 5:  I'd been to, all the photos I'd taken, I gave it all these

73
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,680
Speaker 5:  permissions, but I kind of did it without thinking about it. And on the one

74
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,440
Speaker 5:  hand it makes for a great journaling system. I have these really cool,

75
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,400
Speaker 5:  really complete records of all of my days automatically, but also,

76
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,160
Speaker 5:  you know, yikes, that's a lot of really personal

77
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,000
Speaker 5:  private information for one app to have even more. So when you factor in

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,760
Speaker 5:  that my day one journal, the thing I actually type in is maybe the

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,600
Speaker 5:  one thing on earth I most want to keep private. That to me

80
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,360
Speaker 5:  is the perfect encapsulation of what Chris mentioned in his voicemail. Sure,

81
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,200
Speaker 5:  a paper journal under my mattress would technically be more private, but

82
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,120
Speaker 5:  I want all the modern niceties and upsides of an app like day

83
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,960
Speaker 5:  one. Is it even possible to have it both ways? So I called up the folks

84
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,560
Speaker 5:  at day one to ask him about this

85
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,320
Speaker 6:  Paul main head of day one at Automatic

86
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,120
Speaker 7:  Murphy Randall, lead of the web client team on day one

87
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,800
Speaker 7:  at Automatic.

88
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,080
Speaker 5:  Paul told me that when he was first starting day one, the features and

89
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,960
Speaker 5:  privacy trade off was right at the top of his mind.

90
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,280
Speaker 6:  I wanted something that I trusted myself to capture and

91
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,040
Speaker 6:  store all of these memories that would exist like even after me,

92
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,000
Speaker 6:  but mostly around the comfort of knowing that I could put whatever I wanted

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,920
Speaker 6:  there and it's unlikely or impossible for anyone

94
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,800
Speaker 6:  else to even see it. And that manifested in the early

95
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,640
Speaker 6:  days where it was we were scrappy and just bootstrapping an

96
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,520
Speaker 6:  idea to be offline first where everything was basically

97
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,840
Speaker 6:  a web page and apps just synced with a server.

98
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,840
Speaker 6:  So day one was starting with the Mac to be stored locally on your file

99
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,680
Speaker 6:  system where by default only you, whoever has access to

100
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,240
Speaker 6:  your computer would see it. The downside being, if you lost that computer,

101
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,320
Speaker 6:  you lose all of those memories.

102
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,400
Speaker 5:  Early on with day one there was no way to sync your stuff between

103
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,240
Speaker 5:  devices because there was no way to do it privately. Then for a while you

104
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,720
Speaker 5:  could sync through Dropbox, but eventually Day one built its own end-to-end

105
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,480
Speaker 5:  encrypted service because it didn't want to just offload everything and

106
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,080
Speaker 5:  trust Dropbox. But again, even that is a trade-off end-to-end

107
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,280
Speaker 5:  encryption is a good thing and something you should look for, but it's still

108
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,040
Speaker 5:  a risk. And Murphy who recently led a whole project

109
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,880
Speaker 5:  building a day one web app said that day one is constantly making

110
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,360
Speaker 5:  trade-offs between privacy and convenience features and

111
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,040
Speaker 5:  personality and every one of those choices has consequences.

112
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,000
Speaker 5:  Sometimes ones you don't see,

113
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,600
Speaker 7:  That's the line we walk all the time and we've really messed ourselves up

114
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,120
Speaker 7:  by being a little overzealous with the privacy at times, like for example,

115
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,080
Speaker 7:  we originally locked up so much about entries

116
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,000
Speaker 7:  that like we didn't even allow ourselves to see the date on which the entry

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,680
Speaker 7:  was written. Like you know, the entry date you say like I'm writing a entry

118
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,200
Speaker 7:  on Christmas. The server that we have didn't know that you said it was on

119
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,160
Speaker 7:  Christmas because we wanted to say as much as possible is invisible to

120
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,000
Speaker 7:  us. But it turns out like if you wanna make a web app that can pull

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,520
Speaker 7:  down a few entries, you kind of gotta know the dates. And so that's a

122
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,520
Speaker 7:  line that we had to walk and we are limited in the features

123
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,480
Speaker 7:  we can offer now in some ways because of the stuff that we locked up

124
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,040
Speaker 7:  in the past. And so now you know, we can release an app upgrade that would

125
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,880
Speaker 7:  say like, well okay, maybe we'll just decrypt that one date and make it so

126
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,600
Speaker 7:  that we can let the user say, what journal entries do I have for Christmas?

127
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,120
Speaker 7:  And then you know, get it from the web app. But we do what we can

128
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,040
Speaker 7:  to work within the confines that are set. So

129
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,080
Speaker 7:  the new web client that we're releasing very soon that's in private beta

130
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,400
Speaker 7:  right now. Originally we wanted to make something kind of like Evernote,

131
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,840
Speaker 7:  the Evernote experience where if you go to Evernote you can just see a few

132
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,640
Speaker 7:  of your most recent notes and edit them and it's a very lightweight

133
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,560
Speaker 7:  experience. But since our stuff is end to end encrypted, we ended

134
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,240
Speaker 7:  up having to to go all in and write like a, a more advanced client

135
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,120
Speaker 7:  that would pull all your entries down from the server, decrypt all of them,

136
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,320
Speaker 7:  index them so that you can interact with them in the day

137
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,280
Speaker 7:  one way you know you can't just like fetch a few entries and work on

138
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,840
Speaker 7:  them. That's a technical cost that we incurred by

139
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,800
Speaker 7:  opting for privacy.

140
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,920
Speaker 5:  One example I really like here is passwords and encryption keys.

141
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,960
Speaker 5:  The most private thing an app can do is say here's your

142
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,560
Speaker 5:  encryption key, we don't have it so write it down and if you lose it you're

143
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,120
Speaker 5:  host and we can't help you Privacy wise that feels great

144
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,800
Speaker 5:  convenience wise it's a total pain in the ass. Here's how Paul

145
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Speaker 5:  explained how day one thinks about all that.

146
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,000
Speaker 6:  What we do is we rely on the device

147
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,320
Speaker 6:  manufacturer or or os manufacturer in this case Apple

148
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,240
Speaker 6:  and Google to store in their private key storage

149
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,040
Speaker 6:  solutions. They have a key store that only day

150
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,960
Speaker 6:  one can access this key and then we put it in there and then the app

151
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,080
Speaker 6:  automatically fetches it from there. When you go sign in on another device,

152
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,720
Speaker 6:  it'll, it'll find it in there because you're authenticated with your Apple

153
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,560
Speaker 6:  account. So less secure than managing your own private

154
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,520
Speaker 6:  key and Apple's continuing to advance their security around

155
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,280
Speaker 6:  these things as well. So as they get better, our

156
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,880
Speaker 6:  encryption is better but it's more of a consumer-friendly way of

157
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,880
Speaker 6:  offering end to end encryption, private key storage without the

158
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,600
Speaker 6:  user. The downside of like managing that key in a physical

159
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,560
Speaker 6:  way that if it's lost all is lost like it is with the

160
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:33,800
Speaker 6:  wallet.

161
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,400
Speaker 5:  I also asked Wesley Rosh the developer of another journaling app called Ever

162
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,280
Speaker 5:  Log about the same stuff. He said, he's also trying to figure out how

163
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,240
Speaker 5:  to do secure sync because that turns out to be the first privacy

164
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
Speaker 5:  feature trade off that you really want to get right?

165
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,560
Speaker 8:  Right now the way it is your data, it's secure on your

166
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,960
Speaker 8:  device so it's secured by Apple Secure Enclave and

167
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,920
Speaker 8:  everything. But the moment you sync with Cy Cloud there's a

168
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,640
Speaker 8:  a small chance that the could be breached by, I don't know, someone

169
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,520
Speaker 8:  Apple or so that's pretty important right now.

170
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,760
Speaker 5:  I asked Wesley if there are any features he just straight up can't add

171
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,720
Speaker 5:  to ever log purely for privacy reasons and he said yeah, there are lots of

172
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,520
Speaker 5:  them. The big one is ai.

173
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,840
Speaker 8:  One big thing will be sentiment analysis. Like it would

174
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,680
Speaker 8:  give the AI your entries and it would say this, this entry

175
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,160
Speaker 8:  is positive, this entry is happy, this entry is

176
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,800
Speaker 8:  you're anxious or whatever. That could be great for stats

177
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,760
Speaker 8:  and but again, I don't think people will be interested in sharing

178
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,800
Speaker 8:  their, their stuff with third parties.

179
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,760
Speaker 5:  The more I thought about this trade off between privacy and convenience,

180
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,160
Speaker 5:  between having lots of features and having something that feels like it's

181
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,080
Speaker 5:  just yours, the more I started seeing it everywhere, like in another

182
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,760
Speaker 5:  app I use Obsidian, which is a super popular new note taking app.

183
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,520
Speaker 5:  Part of obsidian whole appeal is that the files it's working with are just

184
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,120
Speaker 5:  markdown files saved on your computer. They're not stored on a server

185
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,840
Speaker 5:  somewhere, they're just there in a folder on your device. Obsidian does

186
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,600
Speaker 5:  have end-to-end encryption but you don't have to use it to use the app. But

187
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,480
Speaker 5:  Obsidian also has this big ecosystem of third party

188
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,120
Speaker 5:  plug-ins where anyone can write code and post it on GitHub

189
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,160
Speaker 5:  that changes the way obsidian looks or adds new features that

190
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,720
Speaker 5:  can get really messy really fast and be a weird privacy

191
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,320
Speaker 5:  thing if you let it. Stefan Ango, the CEO of Obsidian

192
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,200
Speaker 5:  told me he thinks control is the key. He likes the idea of starting

193
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,760
Speaker 5:  with a totally private experience and then letting users

194
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,120
Speaker 5:  choose how much they're willing to give up in exchange for new features.

195
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,320
Speaker 9:  That means that if you wanna build a chat G p T plugin, I think there's like

196
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,520
Speaker 9:  four or five of them already out there that are slightly different

197
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,400
Speaker 9:  variations on how you might want to use chat G P t with your, with your notes.

198
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,240
Speaker 9:  And it comes with you know, caveat enter like

199
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,160
Speaker 9:  there's like a little bit of, because we give you so much freedom, it

200
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,840
Speaker 9:  means that the user has to make their own choices about

201
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,360
Speaker 9:  what they're willing to give up.

202
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,520
Speaker 5:  The trade off here is that obsidian is kind of awkward to figure

203
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,280
Speaker 5:  out when you first set it up. It doesn't do that much. It's just a text editor.

204
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,960
Speaker 5:  Basically you have to figure out how to allow yourself to have

205
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,720
Speaker 5:  plugins and then find and research and add and explore

206
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,640
Speaker 5:  all these additional features basically by yourself. But to some extent I

207
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,600
Speaker 5:  think that's probably a better strategy privacy wise than just dropping you

208
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,080
Speaker 5:  in the deep end and forcing you to figure out how everything works. You might

209
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,960
Speaker 5:  notice by the way, that AI keeps coming up here for good reason. If you

210
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,680
Speaker 5:  wanna look ahead to where all of this goes next, look at chat G P T. There

211
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,040
Speaker 5:  are a bunch of companies out there trying to build tools that apply chat

212
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,920
Speaker 5:  G P T to your life, which sounds great, right? You could ask a

213
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,520
Speaker 5:  chat bot to find that link you were looking at yesterday or remind you what

214
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,040
Speaker 5:  your dentist's name is or I don't know anything else you can think of. But

215
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,880
Speaker 5:  that means giving a tool like chat g p t access to a vast

216
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,640
Speaker 5:  amount of your personal data. Dan Roker, the c o of a company

217
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,600
Speaker 5:  called Rewind is trying to figure out how to bring AI chat bots to life

218
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,120
Speaker 5:  while still getting that privacy convenience balance, right?

219
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,000
Speaker 5:  Rewind is an app that records everything you do on your computer. It takes

220
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Speaker 5:  screenshots every two seconds. It records all your meetings, it stores all

221
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,880
Speaker 5:  your web history and much more. And now you can use chat g

222
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,560
Speaker 5:  P T to interact with all that info. You might think that's useful, you might

223
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,400
Speaker 5:  think it's a total privacy disaster. Dan said he's trying to

224
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,880
Speaker 5:  find a way to get as much of the upside as possible with as little of the

225
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,920
Speaker 5:  downside as possible.

226
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,480
Speaker 10:  I think using privacy as the main constraint and

227
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,480
Speaker 10:  respecting people's privacy is the key technological insight

228
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,080
Speaker 10:  here that will allow this to be adopted by not just sort of tech

229
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,480
Speaker 10:  enthusiasts but mainstream users. Because the reality is, you know, we live

230
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,440
Speaker 10:  in a world where more and more of your data is for sale, you know more and

231
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,360
Speaker 10:  more of your privacy is being, you know, you could could say even compromised

232
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,320
Speaker 10:  for utility. And I think in that world, finding

233
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,800
Speaker 10:  a solution that strikes the right balance and and respects your privacy

234
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,680
Speaker 10:  doesn't just, you know, pretend it doesn't exist, is I think

235
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,600
Speaker 10:  the key unlock to this.

236
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,800
Speaker 5:  The way Rewind does it is to send only the relevant bits of your data to

237
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,720
Speaker 5:  open AI in order to make chat g p t work. So instead of uploading all

238
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,400
Speaker 5:  your data, rewind is first curating just the stuff that matters, turning

239
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,240
Speaker 5:  it into text and then sending it for processing. This feels to me like a

240
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,120
Speaker 5:  pretty good middle ground but it's still a big trade off and I'm not sure

241
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,160
Speaker 5:  I know if the usefulness outweighs the intrusiveness,

242
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,400
Speaker 5:  ultimately I come back to something obsidian. Stefan Ango told me that

243
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,000
Speaker 5:  the best answer is probably lots of answers. Everybody has different principles

244
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,880
Speaker 5:  and needs around privacy and the best thing tech companies can do is give

245
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,320
Speaker 5:  you the information you need to make choices rather than trying to make them

246
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,560
Speaker 5:  for

247
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,960
Speaker 9:  You. It's the same thing as kind of the right to modify,

248
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,680
Speaker 9:  right to extend right to repair. Like those types of

249
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,760
Speaker 9:  ideas I think are are strong within the obsidian community. We want

250
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,440
Speaker 9:  to give the user control, you know, respect the

251
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,320
Speaker 9:  user's ability to work with the software in whatever way

252
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,720
Speaker 9:  they want.

253
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,650
Speaker 5:  Anyway, let me get back to Chris's initial question for a second. I think

254
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,450
Speaker 5:  the answer is complicated, but Chris, to your specific points based on what

255
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,410
Speaker 5:  I've learned here are a few things I would say. One is that most people seem

256
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,330
Speaker 5:  to agree that on balance the iPhone is a more secure ecosystem

257
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,210
Speaker 5:  than Android. I don't think you need a VPN for most everyday web browsing,

258
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,130
Speaker 5:  but if it makes you more comfortable, go for it. There are some good ones

259
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,850
Speaker 5:  out there and I would encourage you to keep different kinds of information

260
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,410
Speaker 5:  in different places and keep your most important, most private,

261
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,610
Speaker 5:  most personal stuff in a place all its own. Ideally, one you

262
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,570
Speaker 5:  control and understand as completely as possible, be wary of things

263
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,810
Speaker 5:  that automatically share stuff with other people. Make sure you understand

264
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,770
Speaker 5:  how the sharing and publishing and collaboration settings work and go for

265
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,210
Speaker 5:  end-to-end encryption anywhere you can. I started out thinking that maybe

266
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,090
Speaker 5:  the only really good answer here is just as little tech as possible.

267
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,690
Speaker 5:  Throw your phone into the river, move into the woods and like write on parchment

268
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,250
Speaker 5:  paper or whatever. But I'm actually encouraged by the potential here that

269
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,970
Speaker 5:  as more people start to care about privacy, there will be more products that

270
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,530
Speaker 5:  actually start with privacy and then build from there. But it's very clear

271
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,530
Speaker 5:  that there will always, always be trade-offs, especially

272
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,240
Speaker 5:  many more hotline questions all of them much more quickly than the one

273
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,520
Speaker 5:  that we just did. First up, Alex Kranz is here. Hi Alex.

274
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,680
Speaker 13:  Hi. I bet I know what it's about.

275
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,120
Speaker 5:  There's like two things you come here for and it's, it's great. And this

276
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,960
Speaker 5:  one's not about Plex so there's only one possible option. Okay, but let's

277
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,520
Speaker 5:  just get to it. We have a question. I believe it is from Andrew.

278
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,560
Speaker 14:  Hi, my name is Andrew, I'm a longtime listener and reader of The Verge

279
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,520
Speaker 14:  and I'm a law student now. I've been thinking about buying an iPad or

280
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,200
Speaker 14:  potentially an EIN tablet but can't seem to decide which might be

281
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,920
Speaker 14:  better for reading and taking notes. So interested to hear some pros and

282
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,800
Speaker 14:  cons. Thanks.

283
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,480
Speaker 5:  Do you see why you're here Alex?

284
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,160
Speaker 13:  I see why I'm

285
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,120
Speaker 5:  Here. So there's two questions here and we, we should take them in turn.

286
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,640
Speaker 5:  The first question is do you buy an iPad or do you buy an E Ink tablet?

287
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,040
Speaker 5:  And then there's gonna be the which one question. But let's start with just

288
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,600
Speaker 5:  that breakdown. Do we, should this person buy an iPad or an E Ink tablet?

289
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,240
Speaker 13:  I feel really bad for saying this, but they should buy the iPad cuz

290
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,520
Speaker 13:  they're going to law school, right? Yeah. If they were just digging around

291
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,160
Speaker 13:  at home like reading and sometimes marking stuff up, I would say get the

292
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,760
Speaker 13:  E Ink tablet. I would have no regrets but they actually needed to work all

293
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,720
Speaker 13:  of the time consistently and not be probably messing with a bunch

294
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,120
Speaker 13:  of like fighting the user interface all the time.

295
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,560
Speaker 13:  And so they'll have a much better time with an iPad if they do that.

296
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I was thinking about this and I, I think the way you just laid that

297
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,920
Speaker 5:  out is exactly right cuz like my, my heart says by a remarkable

298
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,080
Speaker 5:  tablet because it is a truly lovely thing to read PDFs on a

299
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,120
Speaker 13:  Hundred percent and

300
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,200
Speaker 5:  In the actual moment of reading the Ink

301
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,880
Speaker 5:  tablet is much better, right? Like I still have not used a Kindle scribe.

302
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,360
Speaker 5:  You have but my guess would be that literally in the like I am highlighting

303
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,320
Speaker 5:  a page of a PDF thing, the Ink tablet is gonna be better

304
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,680
Speaker 13:  A hundred percent. Yeah.

305
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,640
Speaker 5:  Managing all of those things, getting them on and off your device, moving

306
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,600
Speaker 5:  them around, submitting them to things, sharing them with people.

307
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,240
Speaker 5:  Total disaster on anything not called the iPad and for

308
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,120
Speaker 5:  like, that's where I end up with like the iPad is pretty good as a reading

309
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,920
Speaker 5:  experience and really great as like a life management experience

310
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,960
Speaker 5:  and the ING tablets are really good for reading and just full hot garbage

311
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,560
Speaker 5:  for the other side of things.

312
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,840
Speaker 13:  Yeah, I would honestly say get the iPad but then

313
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,440
Speaker 13:  do what Dan did which is get like that that matte Yeah

314
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,280
Speaker 13:  screen protector so it feels a little bit more like writing on

315
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,960
Speaker 13:  paper and it look, it doesn't have the glare like I think that'll probably

316
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,840
Speaker 13:  be the best for the majority of people who actually need to get work

317
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,040
Speaker 13:  done on the device.

318
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,640
Speaker 5:  I think that's right. We did a whole segment on that on last week's vergecast.

319
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,880
Speaker 5:  So if you haven't listened to it, Dan was very helpful.

320
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,920
Speaker 13:  But then once you get your law degree and you get your signing bonus

321
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,640
Speaker 13:  at whatever big fancy firm you're at, go by the E Ink tablet, you're gonna

322
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,160
Speaker 13:  have a great time with it. You're gonna love it.

323
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,040
Speaker 5:  The EIN tablet is like you make partner and there's like a person who

324
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,320
Speaker 5:  will do all the file management for you and then all you have to do is just

325
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,200
Speaker 5:  like kick back at your desk with your loafers up and read some

326
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,320
Speaker 5:  PDFs. Like that's when you get the EIN tablet and life is incredible.

327
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,600
Speaker 13:  Like you're just marking up other people's briefs. I assume that's a thing.

328
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,680
Speaker 13:  Lawyers do you

329
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,920
Speaker 5:  Just chuck your tablet across the room at them? Yeah,

330
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Speaker 13:  Throw it at their heads.

331
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,560
Speaker 5:  Ferguson read this. Yeah,

332
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,000
Speaker 13:  That's why you have one Ls you throw, throw the tablets at them

333
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,240
Speaker 5:  And do we, what do we think like the, probably either the the

334
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,200
Speaker 5:  iPad error or the iPad Pro depending on how you feel about

335
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,120
Speaker 5:  money and keyboards.

336
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,040
Speaker 13:  Yeah, I think the iPad error is enough for most people. I think they'll

337
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,840
Speaker 13:  have a great time with like an iPad error that Matt screen protector

338
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,440
Speaker 13:  and a nice little pencil that'll get everything they need to get done done.

339
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,160
Speaker 5:  I think that's right. All right, we've, we've helped Andrew You're welcome.

340
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,400
Speaker 5:  Let us know how it goes. Let's move on to the next one. Thank you Alex. You're

341
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,000
Speaker 5:  welcome. For our next question, I have two people here. Dan

342
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,800
Speaker 5:  Seifert. Hello. Hello Allison Johnson. Hello. Welcome back from vacation.

343
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,880
Speaker 13:  Hello. Thank

344
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,440
Speaker 5:  You. And our question I believe is from Nick

345
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,240
Speaker 5:  so let's hear it.

346
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,520
Speaker 15:  Hey Verge, my name is Nick. I had a question about

347
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,760
Speaker 15:  how phone reviews work at the Verge, who reviews it,

348
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,520
Speaker 15:  how you decide who reviews it and then what that process looks

349
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,800
Speaker 15:  like. Love what you do.

350
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,760
Speaker 5:  So I love a good meta verge question

351
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,960
Speaker 5:  and I feel like this is a fun one. We like reviews just sort of like magically

352
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,200
Speaker 5:  appear and it's like let's talk about this. Yeah,

353
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,480
Speaker 16:  They just magically happen. Yeah.

354
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,360
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah, they're they're just there on the website. Yeah, but I, phone

355
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,840
Speaker 5:  reviews I feel like are actually a pretty good one cuz the, our process I

356
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,640
Speaker 5:  feel like has gotten much better for it over time. But Dan you run our reviews

357
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,680
Speaker 5:  program Allison. You do. I would say most of our phone reviews so

358
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,640
Speaker 5:  let's talk through it. New phone comes out or new phone is coming out. What

359
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,040
Speaker 5:  happens we're the Verge people kind of want us to review their stuff, right?

360
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,720
Speaker 5:  Like what, how does this stuff start?

361
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,600
Speaker 16:  Yeah, I guess we could, we'll start right at the beginning. So let's take

362
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,320
Speaker 16:  the example of Samsung, which recently Ren announced the S 23

363
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,400
Speaker 16:  line. So Samsung announces a phone, their PR department will

364
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,120
Speaker 16:  generally contact us and say we've got a new device coming out.

365
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,240
Speaker 16:  And a lot of times they will require what's called an embargo, which

366
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,960
Speaker 16:  means that we say we agree to not talk about this thing until after a certain

367
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,520
Speaker 16:  date and then they will provide the device to us for testing

368
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,200
Speaker 16:  purposes and review so that we have access to it ahead of

369
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,160
Speaker 16:  when it goes on sale. And then we are able to publish our review before

370
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,040
Speaker 16:  or on the day of when it goes on sale, which is usually around the timing

371
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,880
Speaker 16:  when the embargo lifts. And so that is like kind of like a

372
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,680
Speaker 16:  a working relationship that we have with lots of companies with their PR

373
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,560
Speaker 16:  departments. The unique thing there is that we agree

374
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,760
Speaker 16:  to the embargo and that's about it.

375
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,360
Speaker 16:  Beyond that, companies don't have any influence on what our review

376
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,200
Speaker 16:  looks like. They don't get to see a preview of it, they don't get to really,

377
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,080
Speaker 16:  the only time the, that they see the review is the same time is that the

378
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,880
Speaker 16:  audience sees it when it publishes live on the site. And then sometimes

379
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,840
Speaker 16:  they send notices if we you know get a factual error wrong, they give us

380
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,600
Speaker 16:  a heads up or sometimes they just say we don't like your score and we're

381
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,720
Speaker 16:  like tough nooks, you know, that's the kind of relationship there that's

382
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,440
Speaker 16:  all detailed in our ethics statement if you're curious about it on the site.

383
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,000
Speaker 16:  So you can go check that out. Determining who gets to review something is

384
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,360
Speaker 16:  actually pretty straightforward now because we have folks like Allison

385
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,640
Speaker 16:  who are really assigned a beat. So Allison's main job is to cover phones

386
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,480
Speaker 16:  at the Verge. That's what she does all day in, day out. She's our lead phone

387
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,400
Speaker 16:  reviewer. So she's the one that really reviews the vast majority of

388
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,360
Speaker 16:  things. Occasionally other people will review phones. I think the best

389
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,200
Speaker 16:  example is John Porter over in the uk. He has access to devices that

390
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,720
Speaker 16:  we don't get here in the us they don't sell them here in the us they only

391
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,440
Speaker 16:  sell them in Europe or uk. And so he will review those devices cause it

392
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,720
Speaker 16:  makes most sense for him to review it. He can get access to them, he can

393
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,680
Speaker 16:  test it on their networks. Half the time those devices don't even work on

394
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,360
Speaker 16:  our networks. I know Allison has a few inner possession now that are

395
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,840
Speaker 16:  like, yeah good luck getting a signal and forget about 5g. But that, that's

396
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,240
Speaker 16:  kind of like of like the split there. And then because Allison is one person

397
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,200
Speaker 16:  and this is a very large beat to cover, occasionally other folks around

398
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,720
Speaker 16:  the team will help out if Allison's got a really swamped workload and we

399
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,600
Speaker 16:  feel that we need to get a review out in a quicker amount of time

400
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,280
Speaker 16:  than Allison's able to get to it. So occasionally I play kind of like a

401
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,760
Speaker 16:  floater across the team. If someone's swamped or on vacation or something

402
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,520
Speaker 16:  like that, I might pick up a review to so that we have it up on the site

403
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,280
Speaker 16:  and things like that. But really Allison has right of first refusal and

404
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,480
Speaker 16:  really the the the first expectation that she's going to be the reviewer.

405
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,280
Speaker 16:  And you could see that across all of the categories of

406
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,600
Speaker 16:  products that we review. Monica Chin is our laptop reviewer. She's the one

407
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,040
Speaker 16:  reviewing vast majority of our laptops and is like write a first refusal

408
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,440
Speaker 16:  on those. Whereas we're recording this today on Monday. Chris Welch just

409
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,400
Speaker 16:  published two Sonos reviews. He's our speaker and TV and home

410
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,720
Speaker 16:  audio reviewer and headphone reviewer. So he focuses on that. So like when

411
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,880
Speaker 16:  these products get announced we kind of know who's gonna review it already

412
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,000
Speaker 16:  and there's like just kind of like extenuating circumstances where it might

413
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,840
Speaker 16:  be somebody else occasionally NEI likes to like swing

414
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,080
Speaker 16:  in.

415
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,120
Speaker 5:  I was gonna say when a big iPhone comes out, ni Eli magically appears out

416
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,720
Speaker 5:  of the woodwork to review it. He

417
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,040
Speaker 16:  Appears he likes to do his iPhone review once a year. We like to let him

418
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,360
Speaker 16:  do that. You know, and what, who, who am I to argue

419
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,120
Speaker 5:  Right? Keeps him off our back the rest of the year. It works out fine. Yeah,

420
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,080
Speaker 16:  Exactly. And you know, the funny part is generally that is actually

421
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,040
Speaker 16:  a very good example of like where Allison can't really review

422
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,520
Speaker 16:  all the devices that are released at that point in the timeframe that we

423
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,640
Speaker 16:  have. Going back to like when we're getting devices ahead of release, a

424
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,600
Speaker 16:  lot of times we have as little as one week or sometimes less to review a

425
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,760
Speaker 16:  device before that embargo. And if it's an iPhone review, there's a lot

426
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,800
Speaker 16:  of moving parts involved with that. Allison's gotta test the device, she's

427
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,640
Speaker 16:  gotta take a lot of photos, she's gotta take photos of the device, she's

428
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,440
Speaker 16:  gotta take photos with the device. She's gotta kind of like formulate her

429
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,320
Speaker 16:  thoughts and write it all. And then generally she's working with the video

430
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,080
Speaker 16:  team so there's gotta be a video that's gotta be shot, they need to shoot

431
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,160
Speaker 16:  B-roll of it, they need to edit it. All these things generally have to happen

432
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,040
Speaker 16:  within a five to six day span, oftentimes over a weekend. So like it's,

433
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,920
Speaker 16:  it's a very compressed type of schedule. So when Apple releases two, three

434
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,840
Speaker 16:  new iPhones at a time, having somebody like Nii or somebody else on

435
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,800
Speaker 16:  the team that's able to pick up one of those helps us able to be a little

436
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,120
Speaker 16:  bit faster with our publishing and have it out there in time when all of

437
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,800
Speaker 16:  our wonderful competitors will be publishing as well or ahead of the release

438
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,080
Speaker 16:  date or the in-store date. So that's kind of like the general process.

439
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,000
Speaker 16:  But Allison, once it gets passed off to you, then what happens?

440
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:12,360
Speaker 17:  Yeah, so I've, I've kind of figured this out over the past couple of

441
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,320
Speaker 17:  years but I, I've settled into kind of a method when I

442
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,800
Speaker 17:  get a phone and it has to do with like, I really like to have

443
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,200
Speaker 17:  my sim card and make whatever phone it is my

444
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,880
Speaker 17:  phone for the week or two weeks or however long

445
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,040
Speaker 17:  I can't make it work. You know, having like a personal phone that I'm texting

446
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:36,040
Speaker 17:  on and in a review phone. So that's possible with all the

447
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,280
Speaker 17:  major Samsungs and iPhones.

448
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,200
Speaker 5:  So you must spend like a quarter of your time just switching phones at some

449
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,800
Speaker 5:  point. Like I feel like we've all been through this pain and it's, it's a

450
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,400
Speaker 5:  lot. Yes. I I feel you

451
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,880
Speaker 17:  On that. And EIM has ruined my life.

452
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,200
Speaker 17:  Oh yeah, just slowly and I have a lot of

453
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,840
Speaker 17:  thoughts on eim but anyway, one way or another I get my

454
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,640
Speaker 17:  sim and my plan onto the phone. I'm reviewing, I have a

455
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,600
Speaker 17:  password manager, I would be totally lost without it. So I

456
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,000
Speaker 17:  set everything up kind of from scratch, download the password manager,

457
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,880
Speaker 17:  download my handful of apps that I actually really use,

458
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,440
Speaker 17:  which is a shockingly small number.

459
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,480
Speaker 5:  I was gonna ask what are the like yeah when you first get a phone you're

460
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,200
Speaker 5:  like I need these whatever six apps.

461
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,920
Speaker 17:  It's go, it's a little embarrassing. Starbucks is always on there.

462
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,000
Speaker 17:  It's like sure without fail day one I need to download Starbucks.

463
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,280
Speaker 17:  I put Strava on there even though I don't really work out. But I like

464
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,200
Speaker 17:  to, I like to try and do a GPS kind of like walk or run or

465
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,120
Speaker 17:  something. Spotify always and then the

466
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,040
Speaker 17:  social networks. But yeah, that's, I I try to like,

467
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,800
Speaker 17:  I make a phone call with the phone, which is something you can

468
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,760
Speaker 17:  easily forget about but like I use it

469
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,320
Speaker 17:  as a phone, I use it to listen to music. I, I just do

470
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,960
Speaker 17:  everything with it that anybody would do with the phone

471
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,520
Speaker 17:  and I try to do it all within a week.

472
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,240
Speaker 16:  I think that's a, that's a great point there Allison is like you do a lot

473
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,880
Speaker 16:  of the testing that may not show up in the end product, the end review,

474
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,160
Speaker 16:  you might not have a line in there being like phone calls sound fine, like

475
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,560
Speaker 16:  exactly as you expect or like it played the music but the still part of

476
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,480
Speaker 16:  your testing process because if it didn't work then it would be

477
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,320
Speaker 16:  part of the story for

478
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,960
Speaker 17:  Sure. Yeah, exactly. Nobody needs to hear about how I

479
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,640
Speaker 17:  watched a bunch of succession, you know, sitting on my bed

480
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,920
Speaker 17:  on a device and it worked fine.

481
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,080
Speaker 5:  What kind of like specific tests do you run every time? Like do you

482
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,240
Speaker 5:  have a, do you have a picture you take every single time you review a phone

483
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,640
Speaker 5:  or like a place you go to try something?

484
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,720
Speaker 17:  I have a couple scenarios. I really try and I try and do

485
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,600
Speaker 17:  one day where I really stress test a battery and I,

486
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,800
Speaker 17:  I leave my house, which is whoa very difficult

487
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,760
Speaker 17:  to do in this day and age. But like I like getting on the light

488
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,400
Speaker 17:  rail train in Seattle and just kind of using that as like a

489
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,360
Speaker 17:  commute, just cosplaying someone who goes into an office.

490
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:12,600
Speaker 17:  So I, yeah I scroll things on the phone, I take pictures of

491
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,960
Speaker 17:  my toddler cuz I think that is the ultimate stress

492
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,560
Speaker 17:  test of a smartphone camera system. Still

493
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,080
Speaker 17:  haven't really found one that can keep up with the toddler

494
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,240
Speaker 17:  and the cat. I think taking pictures of cats is probably the

495
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,400
Speaker 17:  most important thing I do.

496
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:33,320
Speaker 5:  I would, I would agree with that. Video is obviously a big part of this,

497
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,760
Speaker 5:  so how does that all factor in, especially now like if we're gonna get real

498
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,560
Speaker 5:  meta about the verge, we all used to work in an office and it, it was easier

499
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,800
Speaker 5:  to make these things now if we're gonna do like a big cool video, how does

500
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,040
Speaker 5:  it work?

501
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,040
Speaker 17:  It's changed a little bit since I started. I was being directed

502
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:51,040
Speaker 17:  over Zoom for some of them, which I think by the

503
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Speaker 17:  time I came on you guys had all been doing that for like a year and a half

504
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,960
Speaker 17:  so it went, so it went very well. I think, you know, Becca and Veen

505
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,840
Speaker 17:  and Phil at that time had a really good grasp of like how to get someone

506
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,800
Speaker 17:  like me to shoot usable video of me

507
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,320
Speaker 17:  talking about a phone. But with the return of in-person

508
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,120
Speaker 17:  things, you know, I get to go to San Francisco and

509
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:17,040
Speaker 17:  we have, you know, Veens out there and we shot some things when I was there

510
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,920
Speaker 17:  for Samsung. So yeah, it's changing. I, I'm excited

511
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,800
Speaker 17:  for what it looks like when I can be face to face

512
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,680
Speaker 17:  with someone and, and we can shoot these things in real

513
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:28,960
Speaker 17:  life.

514
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,080
Speaker 5:  I d what a world that's gonna be.

515
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,400
Speaker 17:  Yeah,

516
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,760
Speaker 16:  I think that, I mean you, you kind of highlighted some of the challenges

517
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:38,640
Speaker 16:  of creating video now that we didn't have the

518
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,680
Speaker 16:  same challenges before but I think ultimately it's allowed us to have a

519
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,400
Speaker 16:  lot more variety in our videos and they look different generally in different

520
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,040
Speaker 16:  set setups, different locations and things like that. Whereas when we were

521
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,440
Speaker 16:  all in the office, we got really used to shooting in the same studio all

522
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,040
Speaker 16:  the time and our videos frequently looked very similar from from shot to

523
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,840
Speaker 16:  shot. So that's kind of one of the upsides of the, the the new format now.

524
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,360
Speaker 5:  So Allison, you say you try to only have one phone at a time. Realistically

525
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,640
Speaker 5:  how many phones do you have at a time?

526
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,560
Speaker 17:  Oh my god. So something will happen and I'll need to like

527
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,720
Speaker 17:  check, you know, some software update on one phone and then

528
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,560
Speaker 17:  I have a que I'm like, well what does it look like on this one? And our

529
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,080
Speaker 17:  dining room table will be like seven phones at any given

530
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,960
Speaker 17:  time and my husband is so patient like

531
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,320
Speaker 17:  an alarm will go off. I'm like, shit, I don't know which of

532
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,080
Speaker 17:  these seven phones it is. You know, like I live in fear that I'm

533
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,960
Speaker 17:  forgetting to turn my wakeup alarm off cuz I'll just gotta

534
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,640
Speaker 17:  like pull into the dining room and be like, stop it. Which one is it?

535
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,440
Speaker 17:  So the answer is a

536
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,920
Speaker 5:  Lot. I remember years ago getting a phone call from

537
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,960
Speaker 5:  the security guard at the office saying there's something

538
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,200
Speaker 5:  in your desk that has been playing semi charmed life by third eye blind

539
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,400
Speaker 5:  for like two hours. And it was, I had, I had set that

540
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,840
Speaker 5:  as the alarm on the phone because I thought that was the thing I wondered

541
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,560
Speaker 5:  for my alarm for some reason. And so from like 6:00 AM to the time I showed

542
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,200
Speaker 5:  up, it was just

543
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,010
Speaker 5:  Welcome back. We have a

544
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,410
Speaker 5:  so, so much.

545
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,330
Speaker 19:  How long have we got? Right?

546
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,690
Speaker 5:  So, okay, I think first of all Hayes, congratulations. I hope your new

547
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:57,650
Speaker 5:  apartment is awesome. This is a good moment to like build from the ground

548
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,210
Speaker 5:  up here, right? Because we spend a lot of time talking about like the best

549
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,930
Speaker 5:  mesh networks and should, which fancy routers should you buy? But like

550
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,170
Speaker 5:  very beginning, you wanna start with a thing that works. Where

551
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:12,170
Speaker 5:  would you tell our friend Hayes to start? What's the answer here?

552
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,210
Speaker 19:  Oh, well wifi is, it can be quite subjective,

553
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,570
Speaker 19:  but he said he's moved into his first home, so I'm assuming it's not

554
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:24,530
Speaker 19:  a 1500 door, 2000 square foot house. It's probably

555
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,930
Speaker 19:  a, a smaller apartment. Although you know in Idaho they do have a lot of

556
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,610
Speaker 19:  space so it could be sizable, but if you're in an apartment maybe

557
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,520
Speaker 19:  800, a thousand square feet, you know you are base, you just just need to

558
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,360
Speaker 19:  start with a good router. And now this is different

559
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,760
Speaker 19:  from a modem in most instances, depending on

560
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,680
Speaker 19:  your I S P quite often your i p will supply you with

561
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,840
Speaker 19:  a modem router. So it's both to throw in the gateway phrase

562
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,840
Speaker 19:  I think gateway is, is less relevant. Your the most

563
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,880
Speaker 19:  important tool you need to know are modem and router gateway is sort of

564
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,280
Speaker 19:  something that you may use in other parts of your house.

565
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,640
Speaker 19:  Like you might have additional gateways throughout your house, but modem

566
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,720
Speaker 19:  router are the two important ones and they are very different even though

567
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,640
Speaker 19:  they may be in the same box, which can cause confusion. But if you have

568
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,560
Speaker 19:  a smaller, smaller home, you are fine to have both in one

569
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,240
Speaker 19:  device but you probably do not want to stick with whatever

570
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,000
Speaker 19:  your I S P has sent you. That is kind of the, the rule of

571
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,640
Speaker 19:  thumb because generally these devices aren't as high powered

572
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,880
Speaker 19:  or as feature rich as something you might buy off the shelf. If

573
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,440
Speaker 19:  you have a slightly larger home and or if you are interested in

574
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,240
Speaker 19:  smart home, which we know you are, it's worth considering a mesh

575
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,200
Speaker 19:  router because devices like doorbells security

576
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,120
Speaker 19:  cameras aren't gonna be very close to your router and they still need

577
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,920
Speaker 19:  strong wifi. That's where mesh comes in. But as David said, we're starting

578
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,280
Speaker 19:  at the beginning so we can get to mesh a little later. But to start with,

579
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,400
Speaker 19:  you want an I S P modem and then you wanna buy

580
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,000
Speaker 19:  your own router, which gives you generally a stronger signal,

581
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,400
Speaker 19:  better features.

582
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,360
Speaker 5:  Okay, I'd like to argue with this advice. Okay. I would like to pick one

583
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,800
Speaker 5:  very small fight with you about this advice, which is that I think

584
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,560
Speaker 5:  generally speaking, if if they're just gonna give you a modem, great because

585
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,040
Speaker 5:  I think in general as long as you get like a pretty good modem, your router

586
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,080
Speaker 5:  ends up being the much more important piece of technology. Yes, but at least

587
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:23,240
Speaker 5:  on my bill, my cable company, Comcast disclosure

588
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,840
Speaker 5:  Comcast is an investor in the Fox media and

589
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,440
Speaker 5:  socks at providing internet to my house. The Comcast

590
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:34,400
Speaker 5:  router to me is I think like $10 a month and that's a terrible deal.

591
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,200
Speaker 5:  And if you buy an even pretty good modem for yourself,

592
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,680
Speaker 5:  it will pay itself off very quickly.

593
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,200
Speaker 19:  Modem as opposed to a router. Yes,

594
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,800
Speaker 5:  Because

595
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:47,760
Speaker 19:  Some ISPs won't let you use your own modem. That's true to

596
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,640
Speaker 19:  Comcast's credit, they will let you. That's fair. They have

597
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,600
Speaker 19:  a long list on their website of ones that will work. I for many, many

598
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,480
Speaker 19:  years was with at and t who will not let you, you have to use

599
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,160
Speaker 19:  their modem. So it will depend who you use. And knowing

600
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,040
Speaker 19:  Idaho as I do, I am guessing it's Cox Internet, if they still exist

601
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:11,000
Speaker 19:  as that brand of, they may have changed names, but Cox was what

602
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,520
Speaker 19:  I use when I was there and it was sort of your only option. So yes, depending

603
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,480
Speaker 19:  on your I S P, yeah if you can bring your entirely your own equipment,

604
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,520
Speaker 19:  go for it. But if you're limited, at least bring your own

605
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,120
Speaker 19:  router. One because you don't have to pay the monthly fee and you end up

606
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,520
Speaker 19:  saving money in the long run. And two, because you can make sure your router

607
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,400
Speaker 19:  has some much more interesting features. For example, some of

608
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,640
Speaker 19:  the things that a few of the router companies I was gonna recommend here

609
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,360
Speaker 19:  offer will help with your smart home. For example, both

610
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,200
Speaker 19:  Google Nest and Arrow who both have mesh routers

611
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,200
Speaker 19:  offer thread, which is a very key part of the

612
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,720
Speaker 19:  Smart home, the new standard matter and even if you're not involved with

613
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,520
Speaker 19:  Matter Thread is a great local protocol that will

614
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,040
Speaker 19:  help make smart home devices like sensors and light bulbs

615
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,960
Speaker 19:  work speedier in your home rather than having to rely on the cloud. And

616
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,160
Speaker 19:  if you're looking at starting the smart home, you are in a great place right

617
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,600
Speaker 19:  now because this is the time where you can go out and buy thread enabled

618
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,520
Speaker 19:  devices and not have to worry about relying on the cloud or wifi.

619
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:17,520
Speaker 19:  So you want thread in your router. You also want dual band.

620
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,000
Speaker 19:  If we are starting with basics, you want a 2.4 and a five

621
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,960
Speaker 19:  gigahertz band, don't worry too much about six E, which

622
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,680
Speaker 19:  is the Try band six gigahertz. You probably don't need to worry about that

623
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,600
Speaker 19:  yet. That's, that would be your next router upgrade. I would also

624
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,240
Speaker 19:  recommend wifi six Capable router because that will

625
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,080
Speaker 19:  help if you have multiple devices on your network, which most

626
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,840
Speaker 19:  people these days have, even if you don't have a smart home. So that can

627
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,800
Speaker 19:  help with speed and connectivity in your home. One

628
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,600
Speaker 19:  key feature to look for when you are considering a buying a

629
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,480
Speaker 19:  router and you want to use Smart home devices is the

630
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,280
Speaker 19:  ability to split your bands and or pause

631
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,840
Speaker 19:  the five gigahertz band because frustratingly still

632
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,480
Speaker 19:  far too many smart home devices rely on the 2.4

633
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,200
Speaker 19:  gigahertz band and they sometimes can't connect your network if you

634
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,600
Speaker 19:  have a door band. So Arrow for example,

635
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:18,040
Speaker 19:  has a neat option in its settings where you can just disable five gigahertz

636
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,160
Speaker 19:  for five minutes and help onboard your devices.

637
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:26,040
Speaker 19:  A number of other manufacturers don't offer that option, so that's

638
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,640
Speaker 19:  something to look for. TP link or B

639
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,200
Speaker 19:  net, net gear Arrow, those are all

640
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:37,200
Speaker 19:  good places to start. Arrow and Google are only going to

641
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,800
Speaker 19:  offer mesh. If you don't think you need mesh, then TP Link

642
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,160
Speaker 19:  Netgear are great brands to look at. We haven't done

643
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,880
Speaker 19:  a awful lot of testing at the Verge, but we have a lot of

644
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,240
Speaker 19:  anecdotal information from our staff based on

645
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:56,120
Speaker 19:  standalone routers. I've done a lot of mesh testing

646
00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:00,280
Speaker 19:  in the smart home because I believe mesh is really key in the smart

647
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,080
Speaker 19:  home. And I've tested the arrows and the Google Nest wifi

648
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,240
Speaker 19:  and also the new wise router, which has been very good and is

649
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,960
Speaker 19:  relatively inexpensive, which if you're starting out in your first

650
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,920
Speaker 19:  home, I'm guessing budget is probably a large consideration. So I

651
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,720
Speaker 19:  would recommend checking out wisers new routers. I have found them to be

652
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,360
Speaker 19:  pretty reliable. Just don't put it on anything that might melt because they

653
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,120
Speaker 19:  do get really hot.

654
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,200
Speaker 5:  Okay, I, I agree with everything you just said. I think the one

655
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,450
Speaker 5:  thing I was gonna say is that I think it is

656
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,330
Speaker 5:  almost always worth it in my anecdotal experience

657
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,050
Speaker 5:  to go mesh over the other things. I've talked to so many people over the

658
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,970
Speaker 5:  years, especially if you have a slightly goofy layout like a,

659
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:47,890
Speaker 5:  you sort of have two walls between you and your router at some points a lot

660
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:51,370
Speaker 5:  of people will buy the extenders and the repeaters and those just don't work,

661
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,090
Speaker 19:  Don't do

662
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,970
Speaker 5:  That. Yeah, it's just, it's a waste of money. Like it, it just, it is worth

663
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:59,970
Speaker 5:  the slight extra expense to buy the mesh network.

664
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,450
Speaker 5:  And the other part of it is you can buy the basics of the mesh network

665
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,530
Speaker 5:  and then test it for a little while and if you're like, oh I don't have anything

666
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:10,090
Speaker 5:  in my kitchen you can add to it. So sort of starting small with one of these

667
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:13,770
Speaker 5:  modular networks as opposed to buying a bunch of repeaters and it's just

668
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:17,650
Speaker 5:  gonna set you up much better for a much longer time. But

669
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,130
Speaker 5:  I agree with you wholeheartedly. And my last question about this and then

670
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:23,370
Speaker 5:  we should move on is between the mesh ones, like you were saying, I think

671
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:27,610
Speaker 5:  for most people's purposes the best thing to do is probably

672
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:31,490
Speaker 5:  just kind of deal hunt, right? Like I think for an average person's use

673
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:35,370
Speaker 5:  case, they're all pretty good and the best thing to do is just kind of look

674
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:38,570
Speaker 5:  out for the one that feels like the right price at the right moment as opposed

675
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:42,330
Speaker 5:  to like deep progressive brand loyalty. Do, do you agree with that or is

676
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,970
Speaker 5:  there one that you think is drastically better?

677
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,090
Speaker 19:  No, I agree that deal hunting is, is definitely worth doing Euro because

678
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:52,010
Speaker 19:  it's now owned by Amazon constantly is on major sales and

679
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,610
Speaker 19:  Google Nest often will sort of price match at the same time you'll, you'll

680
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:59,290
Speaker 19:  notice the sales all happen simultaneously. However, if you are

681
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,250
Speaker 19:  a dedicated Google Home user or a dedicated Amazon Alexa user,

682
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,450
Speaker 19:  there are some benefits. I would say Arrow because I actually

683
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:11,290
Speaker 19:  is a ZigBee hub for Amazon Alexa Smart Home. So

684
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,370
Speaker 19:  if you're thinking that you are going to want to use that voice assistant,

685
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:18,210
Speaker 19:  I'll try not to keep saying the name, sorry. If you think you're gonna want

686
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:21,050
Speaker 19:  to use that voice assistant then Arrow is definitely worth considering.

687
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:25,090
Speaker 19:  On the Google Nest side, there is similar integrations,

688
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:29,570
Speaker 19:  although I feel like the Arrow Alexa integration is a lot tighter

689
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:33,810
Speaker 19:  and it does things like you can turn on in the Alexa settings,

690
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:37,250
Speaker 19:  the option to automatically look for devices as they join your network.

691
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:41,170
Speaker 19:  So they just join your Amazon network without you having to do anything,

692
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:45,090
Speaker 19:  which is a very seamless user friendly setup. I also really like

693
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:48,450
Speaker 19:  the Arrow app. One of the things that's changed in recent years with these

694
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,850
Speaker 19:  mesh networks is that you control your entire system through an app and

695
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,530
Speaker 19:  that is actually so much easier than having to go onto a web browser

696
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:59,610
Speaker 19:  and type in your routers code and and start fiddling

697
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:03,410
Speaker 19:  in the backend. And those apps are much easier to control and you can

698
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:07,050
Speaker 19:  set up lots of useful features like parental controls, which probably isn't

699
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:10,730
Speaker 19:  gonna be Hayes's thing right now, but maybe in the future. The one downside

700
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:14,410
Speaker 19:  of the era one though is once your network goes offline, it's very hard

701
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,170
Speaker 19:  to troubleshoot because everything's through the app and you don't have

702
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:20,850
Speaker 19:  internet. Oh true. That's been something I have found a bit of a frustration,

703
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:23,890
Speaker 19:  but these, I'm getting in the weeds a little bit here. I agree with your

704
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:26,930
Speaker 19:  point. Generally most of these are somewhat interchangeable.

705
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,920
Speaker 19:  Personally I would suggest looking for, for your first router, your

706
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,960
Speaker 19:  first mesh network, don't, you don't need all the bells and whistles, just

707
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,880
Speaker 19:  look for some good security features. Those are gonna be key, especially

708
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,680
Speaker 19:  if you're adding smart home devices and don't think you have to

709
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,440
Speaker 19:  spend the most money to get the best performance. You do want to focus

710
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:48,000
Speaker 19:  on the speeds that you have coming into your home.

711
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,880
Speaker 19:  There's no point in buying a router that supports, you know,

712
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,280
Speaker 19:  multi gigabit speeds. If you're only getting 500 megabits, you're just kind

713
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,040
Speaker 19:  of wasting your money there. So that's something you need to check with

714
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,960
Speaker 19:  whichever I S P you have. But if you are getting speedy speeds

715
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,600
Speaker 19:  there in Idaho, then you wanna max out as much as possible and and

716
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:09,600
Speaker 19:  go for multi gigabit speeds, which both APRO and

717
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,560
Speaker 19:  the Google Nest Wifi Pro do offer. And then back to the

718
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,280
Speaker 19:  why's, they also have the Wise Pro, which I believe supports

719
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,680
Speaker 19:  gigabit speeds, but if you don't have gigabit, you can go with the

720
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,120
Speaker 19:  non-pro versions and save a little bit of money.

721
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah, got it. All right. Well hey is good luck. Let us know how it goes.

722
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,440
Speaker 5:  Send pictures. We have one more for you before we let you go here Jen,

723
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,840
Speaker 5:  we have a question about doorbells.

724
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,960
Speaker 19:  Yay. My favorite thing, let's

725
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,160
Speaker 5:  Hear it.

726
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:39,120
Speaker 20:  This is Stephen Robles and I have a question for Jennifer Tuey, your smart

727
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,080
Speaker 20:  home expert just got an ACA G4 video doorbell, would love to

728
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,040
Speaker 20:  know her thoughts on it, maybe a quick review and how does

729
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,240
Speaker 20:  she feel about the whole chime hub situation? Kind of a weird

730
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,520
Speaker 20:  setup. Also, what about matter matter's been out, there's some matter devices

731
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,200
Speaker 20:  out there. Do we still care about matter? Can it actually do anything for

732
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,840
Speaker 20:  those of us just in the home kit space? Thanks a lot.

733
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,480
Speaker 5:  Okay. We're not talking about matter because we don't Darn, we don't have

734
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,800
Speaker 5:  time. We will do that another day. We're gonna come back to matter. This

735
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,680
Speaker 5:  has to end at some point, so we're gonna leave matter. We'll do that another

736
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,520
Speaker 5:  time. But you just wrote a long review of the aara G4 video doorbell.

737
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:18,160
Speaker 5:  So what's the take? Jennifer two, a smart home expert, what do you think?

738
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,160
Speaker 19:  Yes, I did just write a long review and I'm guessing it hadn't posted when

739
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,040
Speaker 19:  Stephen called because Stephen and I have worked together before on podcast.

740
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:29,760
Speaker 19:  He's actually the host of the Home Kit Insider podcast and I know he just

741
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,400
Speaker 19:  picked up one of these and is probably really anxious to find out more about

742
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,240
Speaker 19:  what I thought about it. And my review is it's

743
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,040
Speaker 19:  a great battery powered doorbell for home kit, but it has

744
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,920
Speaker 19:  some flaws. And one actually as

745
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,880
Speaker 19:  he points out is this chime box, which is an interesting workaround

746
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,720
Speaker 19:  and I, I guess is a little back story here. There are

747
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:56,600
Speaker 19:  no battery powered doorbells that support Apple Home

748
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:00,120
Speaker 19:  and Home Kit secure video, which is Apple's version of

749
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:04,320
Speaker 19:  a sort of cloud storage for your videos but your own

750
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:08,280
Speaker 19:  iCloud. So you don't, you're not sharing your data or worried about

751
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,560
Speaker 19:  having your data in someone else's cloud. It's in your own I iCloud. And

752
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,280
Speaker 19:  so it's a very popular service because people obviously have concerns

753
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,480
Speaker 19:  about videos going into the cloud and

754
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,440
Speaker 5:  Correctly. So as we've seen over time

755
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,360
Speaker 19:  Correctly, so Home Kit Zuki video CIR navigates that

756
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,920
Speaker 19:  and provides a very secure, as the name implies, a

757
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,920
Speaker 19:  way of using a video doorbell. But you've only ever

758
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,960
Speaker 19:  been able to use a wire at once. You had to have doorbell wires, which you

759
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,080
Speaker 19:  know is is tricky. A lot of, I'm sure Hayes, back to our last question.

760
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,040
Speaker 19:  You know, you know when you move into an apartment quite often you can't

761
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,400
Speaker 19:  swap out your doorbell or you don't have doorbell wires. Having a battery

762
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,280
Speaker 19:  powered device to stick on the wall would be great. So this was very

763
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,920
Speaker 19:  exciting. Everyone was excited to see a battery powered home kit doorbell,

764
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:54,560
Speaker 19:  but it turns out the way a Cara got around this because battery

765
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:58,400
Speaker 19:  powered doorbells are not supported in home kit is they developed a

766
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,080
Speaker 19:  chime box that has to be plugged into power and that is essentially

767
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:06,080
Speaker 19:  the battery powered doorbell that is connecting to Apple

768
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,880
Speaker 19:  home and then it uses a, a proprietary wireless network

769
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:13,640
Speaker 19:  to talk to the doorbell, which is essentially just a camera with a bunch

770
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,520
Speaker 19:  of batteries in it. There's nothing else in it

771
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,240
Speaker 5:  That's very clever actually. It

772
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,200
Speaker 19:  Is very clever but the downside is if someone unplugs

773
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,640
Speaker 19:  your chime box, your doorbell stops working as I discovered after someone

774
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,320
Speaker 19:  was vacuuming my house and had to unplugged it to plug in the vacuum

775
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,280
Speaker 19:  cleaner and no my doorbell wasn't working anymore. So you know, you've got

776
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,080
Speaker 19:  a bit of a potential floor there and it doesn't work with your

777
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,560
Speaker 19:  existing chime, which is something a lot of people want. So when you press

778
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,200
Speaker 19:  your battery powered smart doorbell, you'd like your existing

779
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,440
Speaker 19:  doorbell chime to go off as well. It doesn't, which is a bit of a bit of

780
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,360
Speaker 19:  a shame, but it does. What is kind of neat about it, you can stick

781
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,040
Speaker 19:  a microSD card in this little time box and record video locally

782
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:58,360
Speaker 19:  from your doorbell and then you've got a little microSD card that you can

783
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,680
Speaker 19:  either pop in your computer or you can view through the Cara app and it

784
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,880
Speaker 19:  will record 24 7, which very few doorbells do.

785
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,520
Speaker 19:  Not that everyone really needs that, but personally I love being able to

786
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,360
Speaker 19:  watch the possums go across my front door at night and some reason

787
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,160
Speaker 19:  motion detectors don't catch them.

788
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,240
Speaker 5:  Everybody has their thing. There's like a whole TikTok genre of that I'm

789
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:17,760
Speaker 5:  sure. Yeah.

790
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:22,760
Speaker 19:  So yeah, the chime is is an interesting workaround. It's unique in the

791
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,120
Speaker 19:  doorbell space. It's actually very similar to what a lot of door locks use

792
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,040
Speaker 19:  because they don't like, they don't want to use wifi radios in

793
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,880
Speaker 19:  their door locks because it's incredibly battery draining and

794
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,600
Speaker 19:  by using a backup power source that's plugged in, you are able

795
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,560
Speaker 19:  to do the heavy lifting in this separate device. But yes, you need

796
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,200
Speaker 19:  to have it plugged in. That is a bit of a floor. It does though play

797
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,120
Speaker 19:  tunes so you can, you can download an MP3 file to the

798
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,080
Speaker 19:  chime box and then when you come home, cuz it has facial recognition, it

799
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,400
Speaker 19:  can play your theme song as you walk up to the front door.

800
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,080
Speaker 5:  It's like walk up music and baseball but for just life. That's awesome.

801
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,880
Speaker 5:  It is cool. What's yours? What does it play when you come home?

802
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:05,360
Speaker 19:  It's the Taylor Swift anti-Hero. It's me.

803
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:10,280
Speaker 5:  It's so good. Oh I like that very much.

804
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,520
Speaker 19:  You know, and so Dave, if you came to my door you could have your own theme

805
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,360
Speaker 19:  song but yeah this doorbell has so many features and as I say, my

806
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,880
Speaker 19:  review, I loved a lot of them. They were great, they were innovative. When

807
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,480
Speaker 19:  I come home and it recognizes my face, it can set the home and my home

808
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,320
Speaker 19:  automation systems to the way I like it, which is really neat. But

809
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,720
Speaker 19:  sadly it has a 16 by nine ratio and this means

810
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,600
Speaker 19:  it can't see packages on your doorstep, which is one of the reasons

811
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,400
Speaker 19:  many people buy video doorbells is to stop potential

812
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,280
Speaker 19:  package thiefs. And so this was a bit of a letdown. The also the video

813
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:48,040
Speaker 19:  quality was not very good. It's a very inexpensive doorbell though,

814
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:52,280
Speaker 19:  $120 which in the scheme of doorbells with these

815
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,040
Speaker 19:  types of features is a bargain. So there were definitely trade-offs

816
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,960
Speaker 19:  and the video quality wasn't great in my experience because I have a covered

817
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,680
Speaker 19:  porch and there's no HDR imaging so you couldn't really make out

818
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,360
Speaker 19:  the faces that clearly unless I kind of, you know, stick your face right

819
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,320
Speaker 19:  up at the doorbell, which is not something a package thief is probably going

820
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,240
Speaker 19:  to do. Fair. Yeah, it had some trade-offs but for their first effort at

821
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,760
Speaker 19:  a doorbell it was good. I did like it. I would recommend it if you have

822
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,120
Speaker 19:  Apple home and you need a battery powered doorbell, especially if you want

823
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,800
Speaker 19:  Taylor Swift to sink to you when you come home,

824
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:26,040
Speaker 5:  That's very important. Yeah, I mean that tricks me is the kind of thing that

825
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,960
Speaker 5:  like good concept probably needs a couple of like

826
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,520
Speaker 5:  little revisions but I like the idea of separating

827
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,480
Speaker 5:  the smarts out of the doorbell itself and into

828
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,200
Speaker 5:  like the chime that actually makes sense to me as a, as a system

829
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,000
Speaker 5:  that you could be more upgradeable over time it'll be easier to replace the

830
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,520
Speaker 5:  batteries and to hang and all this stuff. So I can see why that might be

831
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,000
Speaker 5:  really useful but yeah it seems like it needs a little bit of fine tuning

832
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,640
Speaker 5:  over time.

833
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,960
Speaker 19:  Yeah, I mean it was a, it's a new concept, a new entirely new category

834
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,640
Speaker 19:  for this product as well and for the first attempt I think they did a really

835
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,800
Speaker 19:  good job but there's definitely, as you say, some, some issues to work through.

836
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,760
Speaker 19:  But I do have a very long extensive

837
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,680
Speaker 19:  review on the site if you wanna find out more about all the

838
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,240
Speaker 19:  different features and I actually didn't even mention it does work with

839
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,160
Speaker 19:  everyone else too. It's not just home kit, it works with Amazon's

840
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,960
Speaker 19:  assistant, it also works with Google Home and it can stream to those smart

841
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,440
Speaker 19:  displays and it can use any of those smart displays or speakers as your

842
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,480
Speaker 19:  chime. So even though you can't use your existing chime, you can have

843
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,200
Speaker 19:  your speakers say hey there's someone at the door and you can hardwire it

844
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,840
Speaker 19:  so it has the option of battery or hardwire and you actually need to hardwire

845
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,040
Speaker 19:  it if you want the 24 7 recording cuz otherwise you'll be changing your

846
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,080
Speaker 19:  batteries like every day,

847
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,960
Speaker 5:  Right? Yeah, I mean that's, that's just, this is the life that we leave.

848
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:48,200
Speaker 5:  I like it. All right, well thank you Jen. We, we should keep rolling through

849
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,960
Speaker 5:  some of these questions but this is very helpful. Thank you.

850
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,760
Speaker 19:  Thank you.

851
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,440
Speaker 5:  All right, let's get to our next question which is about subscriptions.

852
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:59,080
Speaker 21:  Hey David, this is Vijay. I recently had a bad

853
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,960
Speaker 21:  experience trying to cancel my cable TV subscription service. I was

854
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,200
Speaker 21:  wondering why they make it so easy to sign up but

855
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:10,760
Speaker 21:  so hard to cancel. You know in this day and age if I can sign

856
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,720
Speaker 21:  up over the phone I should be able to sign out directly, right? And they

857
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,480
Speaker 21:  want me to call to cancel. It was a complicated process. I was

858
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,320
Speaker 21:  wondering why in 2023 we still have to deal with this.

859
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:22,880
Speaker 21:  Thank you.

860
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:27,400
Speaker 5:  Okay, the answer to this one is very simple and very frustrating and it's

861
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,240
Speaker 5:  just because they can, there's nothing preventing these companies from

862
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,320
Speaker 5:  making it really easy for you to sign up and really hard to cancel. And so

863
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:38,200
Speaker 5:  most of them do. The good news is streaming services and such

864
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,760
Speaker 5:  have made it easier over time because there's so much competition. One of

865
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,440
Speaker 5:  the things they have going for them is how easy it is to kind of come and

866
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,120
Speaker 5:  go from a service as you want to. So it's much easier to cancel Netflix or

867
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,720
Speaker 5:  YouTube TV than it is to cancel your cable subscription. So in that sense

868
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,600
Speaker 5:  it's getting slightly better but it mostly still sucks. And the only

869
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,760
Speaker 5:  reason these companies make it hard for you to do is because they can, the

870
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:03,320
Speaker 5:  FTC is actually in the middle of proposing a formal

871
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,440
Speaker 5:  ban on that. Basically when you call and they say you know, we'll make

872
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,960
Speaker 5:  it cheaper or give you a special deal in order to keep you as a customer,

873
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,400
Speaker 5:  there has to be a thing if this ban goes through upfront where you can just

874
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,840
Speaker 5:  say, no, shut up, leave me alone, I want to cancel and you should be able

875
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,920
Speaker 5:  to get out. And that'll go for things like gym memberships which are notoriously

876
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,720
Speaker 5:  hard to cancel and your cable bill and basically any

877
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,400
Speaker 5:  subscription. For me it's like news organizations are often really hard.

878
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,440
Speaker 5:  You can sign up online but then you have to make 11 phone calls to cancel

879
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,160
Speaker 5:  your newspaper subscription. That kind of stuff might start to get better

880
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,760
Speaker 5:  but the only way it's ever gonna get much, much better is regulation. But

881
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,320
Speaker 5:  the good news is it seems likely that that regulation is coming. It's kind

882
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,840
Speaker 5:  of like robocalls in the sense that it's an easy win for some of these agencies

883
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,800
Speaker 5:  because everybody hates it and it's worth fighting against. So that's

884
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,240
Speaker 5:  that. Stay tuned. It might get slightly better over time. All right, let's

885
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,920
Speaker 5:  move on to our final question for today, which is about laptops, which means

886
00:57:57,090 --> 00:58:00,920
Speaker 5:  we gotta talk to Monica Chin. Hi Monica. Hello. Everybody at turns out has

887
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,480
Speaker 5:  questions about laptops but this one comes from Kevin. Let's hear it.

888
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:09,080
Speaker 20:  Hi, my name's Kevin. I'm an engineering student and I'm a

889
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:13,000
Speaker 20:  diehard Apple user. But my friend asked me the other day what kind of laptop

890
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,880
Speaker 20:  you should get and as an engineering student, you know running CAD

891
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,720
Speaker 20:  software, I can't really tell 'em to get a Mac but then I was also like

892
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:24,600
Speaker 20:  I have no idea what PC to recommend. There's so many

893
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,560
Speaker 20:  options out there. So you know, what would you say for like battery

894
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,440
Speaker 20:  life college student running cat software, what would you say is your topic

895
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,040
Speaker 20:  for a new laptop these days?

896
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:38,240
Speaker 5:  Okay, so I just wanna say before we get into this to your listeners,

897
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:42,080
Speaker 5:  if you have a question like this, you gotta tell us your budget. Yeah because

898
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:46,040
Speaker 5:  that's the first question is how much money do you have to spend? So I would

899
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,800
Speaker 5:  say for our purposes here, let's try to keep it like reasonable, right? Like

900
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,280
Speaker 5:  we're gonna, we're gonna say we have some money to throw at this problem

901
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,120
Speaker 5:  but not all of the money in the known universe. And it seems to me this

902
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,800
Speaker 5:  is like a classic Windows computer problem. It's like

903
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,360
Speaker 5:  power versus portability. Cause like you're still a student, you still wanna

904
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,120
Speaker 5:  do stuff but you also like wanna run the hell out of cad. Where

905
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,840
Speaker 5:  where does your head go? What would you recommend for our friend Kevin here?

906
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:13,480
Speaker 22:  Yeah so look, I mean looking at the current landscape, this is a tough

907
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,560
Speaker 22:  question and there's not really a great answer to be able to give you that

908
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,520
Speaker 22:  doesn't ask like some amount of compromise, especially if if we're not

909
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,000
Speaker 22:  going into the crazy budget realm. So it depends a little bit on what

910
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,240
Speaker 22:  software your friend is trying to run. I will say, I know I'm not

911
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,080
Speaker 22:  supposed to answer this way, but a lot of good

912
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:37,000
Speaker 22:  3D software does run on max these days. I

913
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,960
Speaker 22:  know that like not all of it does. If there is a way he can

914
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,200
Speaker 22:  run the software on a Mac if he can he dual boot windows like has he looked

915
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,680
Speaker 22:  into every single option and made absolutely sure that he can't get

916
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:51,720
Speaker 22:  an Apple silicone Mac because that is really in the current laptop

917
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,640
Speaker 22:  landscape the best way to make sure that you're getting both power

918
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,200
Speaker 22:  and battery life and portability and there really are not a ton of other

919
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,880
Speaker 22:  great options that measure up to that. I will say like

920
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:06,040
Speaker 22:  one of the more powerful Mac, like with the M two PRO and the M two max

921
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,800
Speaker 22:  or the Mac studio, we've used these with stuff like Maya, like 3D S max,

922
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:13,720
Speaker 22:  they all run very well on them. These are basically the only, some of the

923
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,360
Speaker 22:  only laptops is if you're looking at the laptop space they would be able

924
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,720
Speaker 22:  to get that can run these programs well that have like any kind of battery

925
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,280
Speaker 22:  life at all.

926
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:22,920
Speaker 5:  That's the main trade off, right? It's like cuz I think to some extent,

927
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:26,960
Speaker 5:  you know you can litigate power versus sort of physical size

928
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,640
Speaker 5:  and stuff like that but it seems to me that the main thing is just especially

929
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,600
Speaker 5:  on the window side, if you want a lot of power, battery life is going to

930
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,000
Speaker 5:  go to absolute hell and that that is like the real thing that Mac has solved

931
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,200
Speaker 5:  is being able to do both of those at once.

932
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,080
Speaker 22:  Yeah, I mean that's, that is really the only one that

933
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,960
Speaker 22:  I've tested that I can recommend that I think will not have you

934
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:51,040
Speaker 22:  needing to plug in like probably at least once a day, if

935
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,000
Speaker 22:  not multiple times. Now I do know that for an engineering student there

936
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,960
Speaker 22:  will be use cases for which running windows on a Mac isn't necessarily

937
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,640
Speaker 22:  gonna be ideal and I know that a lot of engineering departments do recommend

938
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,800
Speaker 22:  that you not get an Apple silicon MacBook. So I understand why

939
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,680
Speaker 22:  you're trying to steer away from that direction. I will say I do know

940
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,840
Speaker 22:  engineering students who use MacBooks who have like no problems with them,

941
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,160
Speaker 22:  but I know that you still may not wanna go in that direction. I do understand

942
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,920
Speaker 22:  that. So as a college student, as someone who went to college,

943
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:24,360
Speaker 22:  as someone who talks to college students a lot about what their, what their

944
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:28,080
Speaker 22:  laptop needs are, portability and battery life are really, really

945
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:32,000
Speaker 22:  huge because if you're gonna be out eight, nine hours a day,

946
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:36,040
Speaker 22:  you know having to search for an outlet all the time is

947
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,440
Speaker 22:  gonna be a huge pain. Having something really bulky, taking up your entire

948
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,880
Speaker 22:  backpack is gonna be huge pain. If you're going to four to five classes,

949
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,760
Speaker 22:  you may have a ton of other stuff you need to fit in there. So

950
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:49,800
Speaker 22:  my advice would be is to think about whether having

951
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,680
Speaker 22:  tons of power that can run these graphically intensive

952
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,360
Speaker 22:  applications really, really fast or having

953
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,560
Speaker 22:  battery life that can get you through the day is more important. I think

954
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,920
Speaker 22:  you should, if, if I were in this student's position I would go a little

955
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,760
Speaker 22:  more towards the battery life side just because as I said before, the college

956
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,640
Speaker 22:  lifestyle you're really, really benefited by having a

957
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,520
Speaker 22:  lot of battery life. And the other thing I will say is I think using

958
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,440
Speaker 22:  these programs on a small screen can get get really,

959
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,200
Speaker 22:  really tough just if you have lots of windows open, if you have a lot of

960
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,040
Speaker 22:  little text using those on a 13 or 14 inch screen, it gives me a

961
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,880
Speaker 22:  headache after doing it for a couple hours. I really think they should be

962
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,360
Speaker 22:  looking at at least a 15 if not a 17 inch screen. My best

963
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,280
Speaker 22:  recommendation for something that will give you battery life. And I

964
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:40,240
Speaker 22:  know you mentioned that that is a priority Yep. For your friend is the LG

965
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,000
Speaker 22:  gram 17 among Windows laptops that I tested last year

966
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:48,320
Speaker 22:  that showed some of the best battery life that you can get. It's

967
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:51,760
Speaker 22:  not close to what you get from Apple but compared to most Windows laptops

968
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,400
Speaker 22:  with its level of power, it is a pretty solid contender.

969
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:59,360
Speaker 22:  The downside is this is not as graphically powerful. It can only come

970
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:03,320
Speaker 22:  with up to a GTX gpu, which is not like,

971
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:07,360
Speaker 22:  it is not anywhere close to NVIDIA's top gpu. It can help out with

972
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,080
Speaker 22:  basic graphic tasks and I would expect you'll be able to run the

973
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,400
Speaker 22:  software that you need to. It will be a little bit slower than if you had

974
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,240
Speaker 22:  something with an RTX GPU or way more powerful processor and a

975
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:22,160
Speaker 22:  big chunk of your laptop. But it is a thin laptop that will be easy

976
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,880
Speaker 22:  to carry and it is light and it will probably give you more decent battery

977
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,760
Speaker 22:  life he'll get from other Windows options if instead you think that's not

978
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,720
Speaker 22:  a GTX isn't enough power for you. And I would encourage your friend to look

979
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,200
Speaker 22:  up if they're not familiar, if he's not familiar, like how much power each

980
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,520
Speaker 22:  of these gps will give him in what exactly he needs. If he thinks he needs

981
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,400
Speaker 22:  an R T X gpu, I would go for the Dell X PS 15 or the Dell XPS

982
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,560
Speaker 22:  17. These are very thin laptops. They're not super, super light, but they

983
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:51,400
Speaker 22:  are not as chunky as like a giant workstation. These will not

984
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,200
Speaker 22:  get used super great battery life. They do get very hot if you

985
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,600
Speaker 22:  are running super intensive programs on them for long periods of time. But

986
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,560
Speaker 22:  they are quite powerful and I think they will run these

987
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:06,400
Speaker 22:  programs much faster than you would see in something like the

988
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:06,640
Speaker 22:  Gram.

989
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:11,040
Speaker 5:  Okay. What about like money is no object power

990
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,760
Speaker 5:  is more important than anything else. Is there a laptop that's

991
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,680
Speaker 5:  kind of satisfies the brief there on the Windows side that it's like it's

992
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,480
Speaker 5:  still needs to work, right? We're not saying like buy a gaming rig and bring

993
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,440
Speaker 5:  it to Starbucks with you every day, but like on the sort of super powered

994
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,120
Speaker 5:  Windows laptop world right now, is there one that you like

995
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:30,920
Speaker 5:  more than the rest?

996
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:34,800
Speaker 22:  Well if you're, if you're going for portability, then I think the XPS is

997
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,560
Speaker 22:  what you want to go for.

998
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:38,880
Speaker 5:  Okay. But let's just say I need, I need like this much portability and like

999
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,960
Speaker 5:  this much power, you know what I mean?

1000
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,400
Speaker 22:  Yeah, I that the XPS is still my answer because any anything else I around,

1001
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,960
Speaker 22:  like for example, if portability is not an object and you really want something

1002
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,320
Speaker 22:  you can keep on your desk all day and maybe move once or twice, then I would

1003
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,720
Speaker 22:  say you could go for something like the Acer concept D easel, which is like

1004
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,480
Speaker 22:  a giant like seven pound laptop that has a screen that can fold like

1005
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,040
Speaker 22:  seven different ways. Oh

1006
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I've seen this thing.

1007
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,600
Speaker 22:  I love that thing. It's so cool. It's, it's honest. It's one of my, the

1008
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,320
Speaker 22:  most fun laptops I've ever tested. I think that would be great for, for

1009
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,520
Speaker 22:  engineering students. It can come with, you can get it with a cuadro, all

1010
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,960
Speaker 22:  kinds of super powerful chips,

1011
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,240
Speaker 5:  But then you're basically the guy who like plugs in the iMac at Starbucks

1012
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:16,760
Speaker 5:  every morning.

1013
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,080
Speaker 22:  I mean that's kind of what it is. Like it, it has a stylist you can draw

1014
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,440
Speaker 22:  on the screen. It's really, really cool. It comes with like there, there

1015
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,240
Speaker 22:  are these like 3D screen options with like glasses free 3D that it comes

1016
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,040
Speaker 22:  with. It's so, so cool. If price and portability are no object, that's what

1017
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,480
Speaker 22:  I would get. But if you, assuming that you want more portability

1018
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:38,640
Speaker 22:  and less money than that, I think, you know, XPS or the LG gram

1019
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,600
Speaker 22:  is what I'd be looking at.

1020
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:43,680
Speaker 5:  All right. I like it. Kevin, let us know what your friend picks and if they
