Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, David Pierce, and Alex Cranz discuss Apple allowing alternative browser engines in the EU, Netflix getting WWE, Pixel 9 leaks, and more.

2
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:19,955
Speaker 3:  Hello and welcome to Our Chest, the flagship podcast, the European Union.

3
00:01:20,985 --> 00:01:21,275
Speaker 1:  Yeah,

4
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:25,395
Speaker 3:  Look, I couldn't get what I wanted by talking about it on this show.

5
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:26,355
Speaker 1:  They

6
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:29,795
Speaker 3:  Earned it. So I called my friends in Europe and said Use the power of the

7
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:31,515
Speaker 3:  state. Yeah, boy did they ever,

8
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:33,515
Speaker 4:  They really did.

9
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:37,755
Speaker 3:  This is the wonkiest way to begin a show about cell phones has ever wonked.

10
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:41,835
Speaker 6:  We won in 1776 and we won again in 2024.

11
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:44,075
Speaker 6:  We're taking over.

12
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:45,435
Speaker 4:  Did we,

13
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:49,635
Speaker 3:  Do you think Okay, let's, let's begin. There's a lot of news this week. Yes.

14
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:53,235
Speaker 3:  Just an overwhelming amount of news. It starts,

15
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:57,235
Speaker 3:  I think we have to begin with the Digital Markets Act in Europe,

16
00:01:57,605 --> 00:02:01,475
Speaker 3:  which is causing just an enormous amount of change to how

17
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:04,915
Speaker 3:  the iPhone and iOS are gonna work in Europe. David, walk us through it 'cause

18
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:05,955
Speaker 3:  it is bananas.

19
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:10,075
Speaker 6:  Yeah, this is actually more bananas than I think

20
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:13,915
Speaker 6:  a lot of people expected and we were kind of expecting bananas. So basically

21
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:17,715
Speaker 6:  Apple today, Thursday announced iOS

22
00:02:17,995 --> 00:02:21,595
Speaker 6:  17.4, which is coming out in March. Apple doesn't

23
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,395
Speaker 6:  normally like go way out of its way to make huge announcements about point

24
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:28,315
Speaker 6:  updates, but there are essentially three big pieces of

25
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:32,155
Speaker 6:  news in here which are kind of one piece of news in three different directions.

26
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:36,355
Speaker 6:  And the big thing here is that Apple is just opening up the app store

27
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:39,955
Speaker 6:  in a really big way. So Apple is going to now allow

28
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:43,915
Speaker 6:  alternate app stores, which it calls alternative app marketplaces.

29
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:47,475
Speaker 6:  And if you call them app stores, they will correct you and say app marketplaces

30
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:52,355
Speaker 6:  on the iPhone. Now I we, we can talk about how all of that works in

31
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:56,075
Speaker 6:  a minute, but that's the first thing. The second thing is they're now allowing

32
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:59,605
Speaker 6:  other browser engines to run on iOS. So

33
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:03,965
Speaker 6:  Chrome and Firefox and all these things can actually run their full tech

34
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,725
Speaker 6:  stack, which means they can run extensions, they can run all kinds of other

35
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:10,565
Speaker 6:  stuff. That is I think a big deal. And then the

36
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,325
Speaker 6:  third and more immediate things starting today is that the app store is now

37
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:18,085
Speaker 6:  open to game streaming services. Things like Game Pass and

38
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:22,165
Speaker 6:  Sony's PlayStation Plus and all that stuff that has not been allowed very

39
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:26,045
Speaker 6:  contentiously in the app store before. Epic wants to

40
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:29,125
Speaker 6:  be in the app store and can't be, can't get the Epic store on the iPhone

41
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:33,325
Speaker 6:  starting now. Those kinds of services are going to be available in the app

42
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:36,925
Speaker 6:  store. All of this, almost all of it is exclusive

43
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:40,685
Speaker 6:  to the EU. This is where the digital markets act is. This stuff is taking

44
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:43,645
Speaker 6:  place there and rather than do what we thought might happen, which is make

45
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:47,685
Speaker 6:  a big global change the way that it did with USBC, the

46
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:50,845
Speaker 6:  EU said it has to be USBC and Apple could have made two phones but elected

47
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:54,605
Speaker 6:  to just switch everything to USBC. Apple is very clearly cleaving

48
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:57,845
Speaker 6:  off this one part of the world and saying this is how things are going to

49
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:01,685
Speaker 6:  work in the EU and in the rest of the world. It is more or

50
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:04,965
Speaker 6:  less business as usual. The game streaming thing is the exception that is

51
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:08,845
Speaker 6:  global. Everything else extremely focused to the EU and

52
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:12,645
Speaker 6:  Apple has made very clear it is doing this against its will and

53
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:16,645
Speaker 6:  with great, great rage and disdain at the entirety of the

54
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:16,805
Speaker 6:  process.

55
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:19,005
Speaker 3:  Yes, they're very mad at Europe. Yeah.

56
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:22,685
Speaker 7:  Like a Paris baguette just like pointed at their head like

57
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:25,925
Speaker 3:  Do it Tim Cook is never eating cheese again. Yeah. Yeah. It's never happening.

58
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:26,365
Speaker 3:  But NELI,

59
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:28,765
Speaker 6:  What I really wanna know is like we, we've been talking about this for forever

60
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:33,325
Speaker 6:  and this just sort of like dropped. Yeah. Like is this

61
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,845
Speaker 6:  what you would've guessed this would be coming into this

62
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:40,085
Speaker 3:  To some extent, the thing that really got me these past few weeks

63
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:44,405
Speaker 3:  is Apple also had to do the alternative

64
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:48,325
Speaker 3:  payments thing and it has gone kicking and screaming

65
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:52,325
Speaker 3:  and basically made that a non-issue. They like weasel their way out

66
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:56,165
Speaker 3:  of, you have to provide outside links to payment services.

67
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:59,445
Speaker 3:  Right. Which they have to per court order in the United States and they made

68
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:03,365
Speaker 3:  that so expensive and so hard to do that. It's never gonna happen.

69
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:07,735
Speaker 3:  And one would assume then I really thought they would

70
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:11,255
Speaker 3:  find some way to do that in Europe too with these rules.

71
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:15,775
Speaker 3:  Then there was a picture of Tim Cook with Margaret Vest sticker who's the

72
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:19,655
Speaker 3:  competition head in Europe. And I pretty sure you know,

73
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:23,375
Speaker 3:  they were meeting about this and I feel more confident than ever

74
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:27,575
Speaker 3:  that Apple made a bit of a horse trade because the EU also wanted

75
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:31,745
Speaker 3:  them to open up iMessage. Right. And that's a weird one

76
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:34,505
Speaker 3:  in the EU. 'cause everyone EU uses like WhatsApp. They don't like, they don't

77
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:38,385
Speaker 3:  use iMessage. Right. So I'm pretty sure Apple got to keep iMessage closed.

78
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:42,345
Speaker 3:  They said we'll do RCS, which it's about time anyway. And the

79
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:45,185
Speaker 3:  EU said Okay, we're gonna leave iMessage alone, but you've gotta do the other

80
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:49,065
Speaker 3:  stuff. And that is the thing. Like I'm pretty sure that that is the,

81
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:52,985
Speaker 3:  the trade that was worked out. Yeah. And so Apple is like to some extent

82
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:57,325
Speaker 3:  going farther than we expected with the browser engines, with the app

83
00:05:57,325 --> 00:06:00,445
Speaker 3:  stores, with game streaming. We should talk about game streaming being global.

84
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:03,845
Speaker 3:  I think that's really interesting. But to some extent they're just making

85
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,845
Speaker 3:  it, it's not quite as bad as the, you have to allow links to external

86
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:10,965
Speaker 3:  payment services in the us. Yeah. Like you can just put another app store

87
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:14,885
Speaker 3:  on there. Those app stores have to be approved by Apple. That apps

88
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:18,125
Speaker 3:  have to be notarized by and there's all this stuff, there's still hoops,

89
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,685
Speaker 3:  but it's not, it's not gonna not happen. Right. The way that external payment

90
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,205
Speaker 3:  services are gonna not happen. And then the browser engine thing,

91
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:30,285
Speaker 3:  I really think just the ability for Google to put the Chrome

92
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:33,605
Speaker 3:  browser engine on on the iPhone will make WebKit better.

93
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:37,765
Speaker 3:  Yes. 'cause Apple will finally have to compete and it can be shown that Apple

94
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:42,125
Speaker 3:  holds WebKit back in order to preference the app store.

95
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:45,605
Speaker 3:  And that alone, if all, if that just happens, if it happens in one country

96
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:49,405
Speaker 3:  in Europe, Luxembourg, Chrome can run on the iPhone and Luxembourg

97
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:53,085
Speaker 3:  that will make web kit better everywhere else, right? Yeah. Because the evidence

98
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:57,005
Speaker 3:  will be available. And I think that's amazing. But I, I

99
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:59,845
Speaker 3:  think there's a little bit of horse trading going on here where they protected

100
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:03,765
Speaker 3:  iMessage, which is the big lock-in, and they were a little more open to everything

101
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:05,885
Speaker 3:  else because they needed to protect

102
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:09,205
Speaker 6:  IMessage. To me, I actually think, and I'm, I'm gonna like try to think this

103
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:11,805
Speaker 6:  out here as I go because this has just occurred to me as you're talking.

104
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:14,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So this might make no sense for a while, but go with me here. I think

105
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:19,205
Speaker 6:  the fact that they're treating game streaming as

106
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:23,125
Speaker 6:  different from the alternative app store thing is

107
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,965
Speaker 6:  really telling because in a certain way they're functionally the same thing.

108
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:30,885
Speaker 6:  Right? It's, it's an app full of other apps, right? Yeah. It's, it's, that's

109
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:33,805
Speaker 6:  what these game streaming things want and that's what the alternative app

110
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:37,325
Speaker 6:  stores want. And I think what Apple may have realized

111
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,365
Speaker 6:  is that the game streaming thing, people will

112
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:45,765
Speaker 6:  go to the ends of the earth to do. Right? Like the, if, if I am

113
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:49,485
Speaker 6:  a Game Pass subscriber, I will do whatever is required to get

114
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:53,445
Speaker 6:  game pass. And that stuff is big enough and powerful enough that people will

115
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:56,325
Speaker 6:  go through whatever hoops are required. So Apple is actually in a certain

116
00:07:56,325 --> 00:08:00,205
Speaker 6:  way, smart to remove some of those hoops and just

117
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:03,805
Speaker 6:  open it up and, and to some extent admit defeat. Right? And it's like we,

118
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:08,165
Speaker 6:  this is, this is just Apple saying, you know what? You

119
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:11,965
Speaker 6:  wanted this, you can have it. And we don't know a ton about what the business

120
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:15,725
Speaker 6:  terms of all of that are gonna be. Apple has been weird about like, it has

121
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:19,285
Speaker 6:  to approve every individual game in the store before and that's been wonky.

122
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:21,845
Speaker 6:  So there, there's a lot left to play out there, but I think Apple for that

123
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:25,775
Speaker 6:  one is kind of just saying you, you want it, you got

124
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:29,695
Speaker 6:  it, you win on this one. I think it seems to me that that

125
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,535
Speaker 6:  there's a, there's a version of this that says Apple is just trying to

126
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,435
Speaker 6:  make it hard enough that not so that it won't happen

127
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:40,995
Speaker 6:  'cause it will happen. You're right. There will be alternate app marketplaces

128
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:45,435
Speaker 6:  on iOS very quickly, but I think they might be able to

129
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:49,395
Speaker 6:  make it hard enough that almost no one caress and, and the way

130
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,955
Speaker 6:  they've set it up, like Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic, which makes Fortnite

131
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:55,370
Speaker 6:  and all that stuff called it malicious compliance, right? Yeah. And we've

132
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,485
Speaker 6:  talked about that with a lot of what Apple has been doing. That's what the,

133
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:03,165
Speaker 6:  you can link out from your app, but you still have to pay us 27% even that

134
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:07,245
Speaker 6:  you're not doing any of this stuff through Apple anymore. That is pure malicious

135
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:11,165
Speaker 6:  compliance. And in this case too, I think you can accuse Apple of

136
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:15,645
Speaker 6:  trying to make it hard for developers to play this game. Like

137
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:19,605
Speaker 6:  if you want to do this, you have to make a different version of

138
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:23,525
Speaker 6:  your app essentially that works in the EU versus

139
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,405
Speaker 6:  the one that works in the rest of the world. But Apple will only accept one

140
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:30,685
Speaker 6:  version of your apps. So you have to make an app that is two apps, one of

141
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:33,205
Speaker 6:  which ones in one place, and one of which runs in the rest of the world.

142
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:37,525
Speaker 6:  You have to go through this process as an app marketplace to get

143
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:41,165
Speaker 6:  all of the apps in it notarized and your marketplace approved.

144
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:45,525
Speaker 6:  If you are a developer, you have to either set up a bunch of other payment

145
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:48,885
Speaker 6:  systems, work with all these different marketplaces, or you just say, you

146
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:52,045
Speaker 6:  know what, screw it. We're not actually saving that much money and just say

147
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:52,885
Speaker 6:  in the App store. Yeah.

148
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:56,805
Speaker 3:  Except there are huge categories of apps that Apple won't allow.

149
00:09:57,455 --> 00:10:01,325
Speaker 3:  Right. This is the thing that I think will be really interesting to you.

150
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:04,285
Speaker 3:  Yes. And I'm not even sure some of these apps should exist,

151
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:06,725
Speaker 3:  right? I

152
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:08,205
Speaker 6:  Mean, porn's the obvious one, right? Deep porn.

153
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:10,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Watch all the porn you want. It's, I'm just saying like,

154
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:14,205
Speaker 3:  I'm not sure deep fake porn generators should exist

155
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:17,525
Speaker 3:  on the iPhone. I think that that's a dangerous territory.

156
00:10:18,415 --> 00:10:21,845
Speaker 3:  Apple would never allow that stuff in its store. You can see how an alternative

157
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:25,805
Speaker 3:  marketplace hoops aside, will certainly allow people to tap the

158
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:29,765
Speaker 3:  vast processing power of whatever a, a series chip

159
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:31,685
Speaker 3:  is in your phone to run some of these apps.

160
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:35,765
Speaker 6:  Even just like apps that show you objectionable content, right? The

161
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:39,045
Speaker 6:  kinds of things that Apple has not allowed before and is actually like a,

162
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:43,045
Speaker 6:  a weapon. Apple has wielded against platforms before that

163
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:46,565
Speaker 6:  is now going to be perfectly permissible to install on the iPhone through

164
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:50,125
Speaker 6:  one of these alternate stores. Like as long as it, as long as the app itself

165
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:53,205
Speaker 6:  is not like a security risk stealing your information,

166
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:57,085
Speaker 6:  it's Apple's content rules do not apply. And

167
00:10:57,705 --> 00:11:00,845
Speaker 6:  that's gotta make Apple feel so gross and icky and

168
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,005
Speaker 3:  They don't like it. Yeah. So I, here's one. And don don't know if Reddit

169
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,765
Speaker 3:  still falls in this category. Tumblr certainly used to fall in this category.

170
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:10,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Where Apple's content rules kept the app

171
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:14,325
Speaker 3:  from showing all the content on the service. Right? So the reason

172
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:18,525
Speaker 3:  Tumblr got rid of porn is because Verizon bought it and Apple said

173
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:21,565
Speaker 3:  to its partner, Verizon, it's big important partner

174
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,285
Speaker 3:  shut it down. Yeah. And Verizon said, we sell the iPhone No.

175
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:30,405
Speaker 3:  And Apple said shut it down and Verizon caved like end of story, right?

176
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:32,605
Speaker 3:  And then WordPress bought it and they tried to have a fight and they like

177
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:37,045
Speaker 3:  found the same little exception as Reddit, which is, eh, what

178
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:40,885
Speaker 3:  if you don't, you know, like that's basically how It works on Reddit. It's

179
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:44,645
Speaker 3:  basically how it was gonna work on Tumblr. But all these things, like all

180
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:45,845
Speaker 3:  these hoops we talk about all the time,

181
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:51,365
Speaker 3:  like Apple makes developers jump through hoops. There are some categories

182
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:55,245
Speaker 3:  of apps that just do not exist because of the hoops. And in

183
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:55,485
Speaker 3:  Europe

184
00:11:57,295 --> 00:12:01,135
Speaker 3:  I, yeah, it's like not worth it for saving 3%. That's not

185
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:04,415
Speaker 3:  even 3%. But when it's existential,

186
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:07,655
Speaker 3:  I think a bunch of developers are gonna jump through the hoops and I think

187
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:10,735
Speaker 3:  the first category of apps that have existential

188
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:15,175
Speaker 3:  problems or the ones Apple forbids, which necessarily

189
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:18,855
Speaker 3:  means Apple's gonna win the first battle here by saying, look at all the

190
00:12:18,855 --> 00:12:22,175
Speaker 3:  stuff you enabled. Like look at all the porn. Like that's what they're gonna

191
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,975
Speaker 3:  say, look, you made a porn marketplace. Are you, are you, are you happy Europe?

192
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,095
Speaker 3:  People say in Europe, being Europe is gonna be like, yeah we are historically

193
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:31,975
Speaker 3:  topless so that's fine. We don't believe in that. Like think

194
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:34,655
Speaker 3:  about what we invented. We're the French right and they're gonna be fine

195
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:38,335
Speaker 3:  with it. And I, but I, I think that there's

196
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:42,215
Speaker 3:  another turn here where there are categories of apps that

197
00:12:42,215 --> 00:12:45,695
Speaker 3:  we can't even imagine that don't exist on the phone. There are

198
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,095
Speaker 3:  categories of business models that we cannot imagine that don't exist on

199
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:52,175
Speaker 3:  the phone. And we might see some of those develop in Europe because now they

200
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:56,135
Speaker 3:  have actual access to customers on their devices without having

201
00:12:56,135 --> 00:13:00,095
Speaker 3:  to ask Apple for permission. And I think game streaming is that category.

202
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:03,775
Speaker 3:  It is the category of things where everybody can imagine it, everyone can

203
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:05,855
Speaker 3:  envision it and it does not exist. And

204
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:09,215
Speaker 7:  I do wanna say like David, you kind of said eh, it's not that big a deal.

205
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:13,335
Speaker 7:  I do think having to get App Store permission for every single game

206
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,335
Speaker 7:  that's gonna be on these streaming services is pretty onerous. Like that

207
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:20,215
Speaker 7:  was something that Nvidia and, and Microsoft and I

208
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:22,855
Speaker 7:  think even Google were pretty against a couple of years ago. And I'm curious

209
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:25,935
Speaker 7:  to see if there's, if their opinions have changed, we've reached out to them,

210
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:29,575
Speaker 7:  we haven't heard back yet, but really, really curious there because before

211
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,615
Speaker 7:  they were like, no, we don't wanna send every like cures of War five, we

212
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:35,015
Speaker 7:  don't want you approving that. We don't like why should we have to get your

213
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:35,695
Speaker 7:  approval for it?

214
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:38,535
Speaker 3:  Well then you take the console maker approvals for those games. Yeah,

215
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:41,855
Speaker 7:  That's true. But I think there, there's certain things, there's certain types

216
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:45,175
Speaker 7:  of games and stuff that might be more permissible in a console setting,

217
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:48,575
Speaker 7:  particularly like around gambling and that sort of thing that are less permissible

218
00:13:48,575 --> 00:13:50,695
Speaker 7:  on the I store on, oh on the Apple store.

219
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:54,095
Speaker 3:  Oh, here's another whole category. Gambling, you mentioned gambling. Yeah.

220
00:13:54,155 --> 00:13:58,015
Speaker 3:  So gambling right now not allowed any NFT apps.

221
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:02,095
Speaker 3:  Any crypto apps do not exist on the iPhone. Totally. So if you're

222
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:05,775
Speaker 3:  in Europe, your ability to o open an app store that's like gambling,

223
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:10,455
Speaker 3:  pornography, cryptocurrency, mining. Yeah. the

224
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:13,175
Speaker 3:  time of your life. This is why Monaco exists from what I understand,

225
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:17,775
Speaker 6:  They're gonna get so rich, like the number of billionaires in

226
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,095
Speaker 6:  Europe is about to spike through the

227
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:19,455
Speaker 3:  Roof.

228
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:25,335
Speaker 3:  But all that stuff is like wild to think about. Right? That and it's gonna

229
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:29,095
Speaker 3:  play to Apple's favor because the stuff that most people can immediately

230
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:32,855
Speaker 3:  think of that is against Apple's rules is stuff that is morally questionable.

231
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:35,535
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Right, right. Or at least arguably morally questionable.

232
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:39,415
Speaker 6:  I think that there's a flip side to that. That is basically

233
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:43,815
Speaker 6:  businesses that couldn't afford to be on the iPhone, which

234
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:47,335
Speaker 6:  is like the, the, the rub has always been basically if you don't run a business

235
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:51,055
Speaker 6:  at a 30% margin, you can't exist in a useful

236
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:54,845
Speaker 6:  way on the iPhone because Apple's going to take 30%. So like audiobook is

237
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:58,085
Speaker 6:  one you hear a lot, right? Like it's very hard to make a thing that sells

238
00:14:58,095 --> 00:15:01,845
Speaker 6:  audiobooks in a good useful way on the iPhone

239
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:05,805
Speaker 6:  because you have to give Apple 30% and that business does not afford you

240
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:09,645
Speaker 6:  30% margin to give to Apple. And now if you wanna be in

241
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:13,485
Speaker 6:  an alternate app store using non-Apple payments,

242
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:17,205
Speaker 6:  which in the EU you're gonna be allowed to do, you suddenly owe Apple nothing.

243
00:15:17,665 --> 00:15:21,445
Speaker 6:  And that like your, your agreement with the marketplace Who knows what that'll

244
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:25,285
Speaker 6:  be, whatever. But that suddenly changes the kinds of business at

245
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:28,805
Speaker 6:  the low end of what you can do on the iPhone because you don't

246
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:32,205
Speaker 6:  have to give Apple 30% of everything that you do, which is pretty powerful.

247
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:35,925
Speaker 7:  I could see a company like Amazon who already has, knows how to make an app

248
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:38,085
Speaker 7:  store just being like, all right, we're gonna pull the Kindle app.

249
00:15:38,265 --> 00:15:38,645
Speaker 3:  Do they?

250
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:40,885
Speaker 7:  Well technic they

251
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:41,285
Speaker 3:  Do in theory.

252
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:44,925
Speaker 7:  In theory they do. They've made something and it resembles an app store.

253
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:47,925
Speaker 7:  They could very easily be like, okay, we're gonna get rid of the Kindle app

254
00:15:47,985 --> 00:15:48,805
Speaker 7:  on, on the Apple

255
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:52,765
Speaker 3:  Floor. And yeah. And I look forward to Amazon executing a

256
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,885
Speaker 3:  software platform at scale. It'll be great. Let's,

257
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:58,645
Speaker 6:  They're gonna put the silk browser in there. It's gonna be sick. Yeah.

258
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,085
Speaker 3:  I think, I think, you know, Andy will believe it when we see it.

259
00:16:04,145 --> 00:16:08,005
Speaker 3:  But I look forward to your attempts. A large company runs a

260
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:08,805
Speaker 3:  Wix. No, you,

261
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:12,525
Speaker 6:  You know what I think is perfectly possible is that the Kindle app stays

262
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:16,365
Speaker 6:  in the app store but also goes into a separate

263
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:20,845
Speaker 6:  Amazon run marketplace. Like Alex you're talking about. And then Amazon can

264
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:23,645
Speaker 6:  say, you know what, if you want the easy way, here it is. This is the way

265
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:25,925
Speaker 6:  the Kindle has always been. But if you do this thing, just hook it up to

266
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:29,365
Speaker 6:  your Amazon account and you have one click purchasing for all of your Kindle

267
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:32,485
Speaker 6:  books and audiobooks forever. And I like, I hadn't really thought about that

268
00:16:32,485 --> 00:16:36,285
Speaker 6:  until you mentioned Kindle, but like I would download a new

269
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:39,285
Speaker 6:  marketplace for that in order to be able to easily buy Kindle books on my

270
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:41,245
Speaker 6:  phone. I would go through whatever hoops I had to

271
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:45,445
Speaker 3:  Amazon and Spotify will start their marketplace tomorrow. Right. And

272
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:49,085
Speaker 3:  so Spotify can se sell you. Its, well I guess they're doing

273
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:50,605
Speaker 3:  audiobooks too. That's very competitive.

274
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:52,405
Speaker 7:  They're not gonna, yeah. Unless there's

275
00:16:52,405 --> 00:16:54,125
Speaker 3:  Like, maybe they won't do that together. Maybe

276
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,965
Speaker 7:  Like Waterstones or somebody's like, we're gonna start the bookstore, the

277
00:16:56,965 --> 00:17:00,405
Speaker 7:  book app bookstore or something free, free idea for you. Well,

278
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:03,965
Speaker 3:  At the very least I look forward to just a, an explosion of bad ideas. Yes.

279
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:05,245
Speaker 3:  And gambling and porn.

280
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:06,845
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it's gonna be great.

281
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:09,485
Speaker 6:  NELI is moving to Luxembourg is the other news on this

282
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:12,485
Speaker 3:  Podcast. Okay. So that's the app store side, which I think is like understandable,

283
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,805
Speaker 3:  right? You can see, okay, we're gonna open this up, we're gonna bypass the

284
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:19,645
Speaker 3:  app store rules, maybe lower some fees or maybe not, depending on how we'll,

285
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:23,005
Speaker 3:  you know, there, there's some complexity in there. But we'll let apps onto

286
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:26,985
Speaker 3:  the phone that don't have to meet apps, store rules. You can, you can

287
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:29,545
Speaker 3:  just imagine all kinds of apps that are gonna happen there. And some of them

288
00:17:29,545 --> 00:17:32,945
Speaker 3:  will and some of they won't. And we will let that develop. The browser side

289
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:36,565
Speaker 3:  of it to me is actually the bigger deal. And I

290
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:39,645
Speaker 3:  mentioned Luxembourg, but I really mean this like

291
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,805
Speaker 3:  there is no pressure on WebKit on the iPhone Zero

292
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:47,925
Speaker 3:  Apple gets to do with that web browser exactly as it pleases and it gets

293
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:51,245
Speaker 3:  to impose whatever limitations on that browser it wants

294
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,885
Speaker 3:  and that is just very meaningful for a lot of things. Yep. It

295
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:59,685
Speaker 3:  means that the, the ability for apps to distribute on the web is

296
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:03,285
Speaker 3:  effectively capped on mobile by whatever Apple wants, whatever

297
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:06,565
Speaker 3:  boundary it wants for the app store. So I'll just give everybody this example.

298
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:10,925
Speaker 3:  I'm looking at my Mac, it is running zero native

299
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:13,285
Speaker 3:  apps right now. Well it's, it's running too. It's running Mime Stream and

300
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:16,365
Speaker 3:  Notion Calendar, which are both native. Nice. But that's only 'cause I'm

301
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:17,485
Speaker 3:  a snob and I read installer.

302
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:22,125
Speaker 3:  That's why it's so good. It's everything else is a web app. Yeah. Like, or

303
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:26,205
Speaker 3:  it best a, a wrapper around a web app, right? It's some

304
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:30,165
Speaker 3:  electron thing is happening to run Slack and almost everything else on my

305
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:33,965
Speaker 3:  Mac is a web app or running in Chrome. Almost every desktop application

306
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:37,405
Speaker 3:  that you can think of that isn't like a game or a, you know, a video editing

307
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:40,725
Speaker 3:  software, gene splicing whatever. You might need the actual power of this

308
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:44,645
Speaker 3:  Mac to do anything else that's like a reader or a information

309
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:48,645
Speaker 3:  management app or any of this stuff. Almost all of it on the cloud expressed

310
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:51,965
Speaker 3:  to you through a web browser. Every AI service you can think of is happening

311
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,885
Speaker 3:  on a data center expressed to you through a web browser. There's no chat

312
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:58,525
Speaker 3:  GBT app for the Mac. There's the web and that

313
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:02,445
Speaker 3:  is because the web is a great distribution platform on desktop computers

314
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:06,365
Speaker 3:  because there's actual competition between browser makers and then everyone

315
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:08,125
Speaker 3:  picks Chrome fine. Well

316
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:12,085
Speaker 6:  And because your browser gets to do stuff, right?

317
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:15,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like your browser has access to system features and

318
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:19,525
Speaker 6:  it can store a lot of stuff on the desktop and it can run stuff

319
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:23,405
Speaker 6:  offline inside of a browser. Like your browser has so much

320
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:27,565
Speaker 6:  access to the rest of the machine on your desktop, which gives it all these

321
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:31,525
Speaker 6:  powers that phone browsers just do not have. And that is a

322
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:35,365
Speaker 6:  deliberate choice that Apple in particular has made for a very long time

323
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,125
Speaker 6:  and they are so mad. Oh they're so mad.

324
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:42,205
Speaker 3:  Well they're mad I, before I get to mad, I just want to stay on Apple making

325
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:46,165
Speaker 3:  that choice. Yes. It's a phone. Yes, it's battery constrained. Yes. The

326
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:50,045
Speaker 3:  screen is small. My old Mac are vastly less

327
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:54,165
Speaker 3:  powerful than my current iPhone. Right? Like when I do this show at home,

328
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:58,005
Speaker 3:  I do it on a 2015 iMac. I promise

329
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:01,965
Speaker 3:  you my iPhone is more powerful than that computer. Like vastly more powerful

330
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:05,805
Speaker 3:  than that computer. That computer is so much more capable. If I had to have

331
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:09,805
Speaker 3:  one computer forever, I would probably, between my current

332
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:13,765
Speaker 3:  iPhone and that Mac, I, yeah, I'd probably pick the iPhone just

333
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:17,845
Speaker 3:  for a number of reasons. but it would be hard, right? I'd be

334
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:21,045
Speaker 3:  like, well here's all the things I won't be able to do anymore. Right. And

335
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:25,085
Speaker 3:  that is weird. That's not related to the, the power of the chip.

336
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:28,885
Speaker 3:  No. It's related to the flexibility of the operating system and in particular

337
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:33,365
Speaker 3:  the ability of the browser to do almost anything. Right. It contains

338
00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:37,405
Speaker 3:  a vastly more powerful, much less encumbered at platform in the

339
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:41,045
Speaker 3:  browser and WebKit stops. And so

340
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:44,765
Speaker 3:  just having another browser engine on the phone to show

341
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:48,285
Speaker 3:  everyone here's what you could do if you, you had great browsers on this

342
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:52,205
Speaker 3:  phone as the default I pr I Apple cannot make a version of

343
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:55,485
Speaker 3:  WebKit for Europe and a version of WebKit for everyone else. That sucks,

344
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:59,205
Speaker 3:  right? Like they just can't do that. And I think that pressure is gonna push

345
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,725
Speaker 3:  WebKit, which will then in turn push the app store, which will be good.

346
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:03,565
Speaker 3:  Will

347
00:21:03,565 --> 00:21:07,085
Speaker 7:  That also mean in the EU the annoying like

348
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:10,885
Speaker 7:  download the app instead of using the website thing will go away?

349
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:14,865
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Because you'll have all the people like using Chrome and it won't necessarily

350
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:15,665
Speaker 7:  flag as mobile.

351
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:19,425
Speaker 3:  No because there's a PM on some app growth team somewhere that's measured

352
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:23,265
Speaker 3:  in app installs and that she will bribe whoever

353
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:24,985
Speaker 3:  needs to put that cookie banner on.

354
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:28,745
Speaker 6:  But like that's actually, that's a perfect reason because like do you know

355
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:32,145
Speaker 6:  why people want app installs is because when they have an app install, they

356
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:34,705
Speaker 6:  get to put a thing on your home screen, they get to send you push notifications,

357
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:38,785
Speaker 6:  they get more power over what happens on your device. They get to

358
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:41,865
Speaker 6:  take things like your location and all this personal information about you.

359
00:21:41,975 --> 00:21:45,825
Speaker 6:  Like that's stuff that Apple gave to app developers

360
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:49,425
Speaker 6:  that it could have given to web apps and just didn't

361
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:53,265
Speaker 6:  because Apple, it's all the same stuff, right? Like Apple wants

362
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:56,705
Speaker 6:  full control over every single thing that happens on its system and you cannot

363
00:21:56,765 --> 00:22:00,545
Speaker 6:  do that to the web. And I think if you believe the web

364
00:22:00,565 --> 00:22:04,425
Speaker 6:  is a good thing for that reason, this is a great thing. I think if you're

365
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:07,905
Speaker 6:  Apple, you do this kicking and screaming, which is very clearly what Apple

366
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:10,705
Speaker 6:  is trying to do. Like basically when you're Apple and you're writing in your

367
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,705
Speaker 6:  press releases that you're like big mad about this. Like

368
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:16,585
Speaker 6:  it's pretty, it's pretty brutal. It's

369
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,025
Speaker 7:  Very funny.

370
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:21,345
Speaker 6:  But no, I, I agree and I think the, the this improvement in the web,

371
00:22:21,345 --> 00:22:24,625
Speaker 6:  which to Apple's credit Safari has gotten better

372
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:29,025
Speaker 6:  in the last couple of years, I would say almost certainly

373
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:32,545
Speaker 6:  because of regulatory pressure. But Safari has gotten better. You can now

374
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:36,505
Speaker 6:  install a progressive web app on your phone and it runs more or less

375
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:40,225
Speaker 6:  like an native app. You know what's crazy? The web has supported that

376
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:40,665
Speaker 6:  forever.

377
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:42,705
Speaker 3:  Like, do

378
00:22:42,705 --> 00:22:45,545
Speaker 6:  You remember how many years you couldn't run background audio in Safari?

379
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:48,225
Speaker 6:  Yeah. If you left Safari, it would just stop playing whatever you're listening.

380
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:52,065
Speaker 6:  Like that's just a choice. And I think you're right that if this goes well,

381
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:55,385
Speaker 6:  that is one thing that will percolate back out is Apple is going to have

382
00:22:55,385 --> 00:22:59,345
Speaker 6:  to win that stuff. And this is like, all of this is so tied

383
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,905
Speaker 6:  together in my brain now. 'cause like I spent all this time at the Google

384
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:06,745
Speaker 6:  antitrust trial where they talked a ton about this Apple deal and it's like,

385
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:10,665
Speaker 6:  oh, apple makes a lot of money because of this deal from Google. Google

386
00:23:10,685 --> 00:23:13,385
Speaker 6:  is gonna be less inclined to give Apple all that money if Safari stops working.

387
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:17,305
Speaker 6:  So Apple has a real competitive reason to make Safari work

388
00:23:17,575 --> 00:23:21,385
Speaker 6:  even in a world where it wants apps to work. So like this flywheel

389
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:24,705
Speaker 6:  of, can we make the web a little better? I think you're right, is going to

390
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:28,665
Speaker 6:  push Apple in good directions because it actually has found a way

391
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:32,625
Speaker 6:  to make a lot of money off of the open web. So like kudos to Apple. but it's,

392
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,265
Speaker 6:  it's a good thing for us. I I really think

393
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:38,065
Speaker 3:  It, it found, it pointed a gun at Google and said, do you want this

394
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:41,225
Speaker 3:  data? And Google said weed. Yes. Yeah, please.

395
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:46,445
Speaker 3:  The game stream one. I I, it's interesting it's Apple for the first time

396
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:50,765
Speaker 3:  admitting that the app store has segments and some are more lucrative than

397
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:54,565
Speaker 3:  the others. Right? And it, so it said, okay, games are,

398
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:57,485
Speaker 3:  we're fine, they're different. We're gonna treat them differently. We're

399
00:23:57,485 --> 00:24:00,205
Speaker 3:  gonna go global because Microsoft will just like kick our butt all over the

400
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,965
Speaker 3:  globe if we only let this happen in Europe. 'cause then at every

401
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:07,605
Speaker 3:  Xbox developer event, Microsoft will be like, well you can do it in Europe.

402
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:12,005
Speaker 3:  Call your senator. Right? Like they'll just do it. And if

403
00:24:12,005 --> 00:24:15,925
Speaker 3:  you'll remember during the Apple versus Epic trial, apple could

404
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:19,845
Speaker 3:  not figure out how to differentiate between Roblox and

405
00:24:19,845 --> 00:24:23,685
Speaker 3:  the things you can build and develop and distribute in Roblox and everything

406
00:24:23,685 --> 00:24:27,645
Speaker 3:  else. Like literally it could not distinguish between Roblox and Minecraft.

407
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:31,525
Speaker 3:  Like at at one point they were asked is, is Roblox a game? And they're like,

408
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:34,485
Speaker 3:  yes. And they're like, but it has purchases in it. And they're like, yes.

409
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:38,125
Speaker 3:  And they're like, okay what about in-app purchases in not Roblox. I'm like,

410
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:43,455
Speaker 3:  that's a game too. And they're just like, like

411
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,895
Speaker 3:  literally like I could not figure it out. And I think this is them for the

412
00:24:46,895 --> 00:24:50,175
Speaker 3:  first time just being like, okay, there are things called games

413
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:54,655
Speaker 3:  and we're gonna put them over here and control them differently. And I,

414
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:56,255
Speaker 3:  that's a sign of maturity. But

415
00:24:56,255 --> 00:25:00,235
Speaker 7:  Are they gonna do that with Roblox? Like is

416
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:04,195
Speaker 7:  somebody gonna go and approve the game where my, my godson is a prison warden.

417
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:08,175
Speaker 7:  He's very proud of his prison. Because you can do that in Roblox right

418
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:11,535
Speaker 6:  Now. Yeah. It's so hard to tell. So lemme lemme just read you the, the thing

419
00:25:11,535 --> 00:25:14,535
Speaker 6:  that Apple says in its announcement, it says that each experience made available

420
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:18,375
Speaker 6:  in an app on the app store will be required to adhere to all app store review

421
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:21,895
Speaker 6:  guidelines and its host app will need to maintain an age rating of the highest

422
00:25:21,995 --> 00:25:25,055
Speaker 6:  age rated content included in the app. So the first part or the second part

423
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:28,335
Speaker 6:  of that simple, straightforward, understood. If you have one, you know

424
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:33,215
Speaker 6:  NC 17 game NC 17 required to adhere to

425
00:25:33,995 --> 00:25:37,415
Speaker 6:  is like a, an opening you could drive a truck through. Like does that mean

426
00:25:37,415 --> 00:25:40,935
Speaker 6:  it's gonna get reviewed? Does that mean Apple can just kick you off if it's

427
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:44,855
Speaker 6:  bad? Does that mean just like handshake agreement? Don't do

428
00:25:44,855 --> 00:25:45,055
Speaker 6:  that.

429
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:49,845
Speaker 6:  I have no idea. Yeah. Yeah. And it seems very important. 'cause to your point,

430
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:53,725
Speaker 6:  Alex, like the thing where everybody had to submit and

431
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:57,605
Speaker 6:  create and have reviewed every single game on their service was like a non-starter.

432
00:25:58,185 --> 00:26:02,045
Speaker 6:  And the way that Apple phrases, it leaves open everything

433
00:26:02,115 --> 00:26:05,885
Speaker 6:  from that to Apple doesn't care. Just be cool. Like

434
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:09,405
Speaker 3:  Yeah. one of the reasons it was a non-starter was the idea that you would

435
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:12,965
Speaker 3:  be distributing multiple game binaries. Yeah. Which is

436
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:17,045
Speaker 3:  dumb, right? For a streaming service. Whereas this is like, you'll have a,

437
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:20,845
Speaker 3:  a streaming service wrapper, you'll click on a game in it and it will stream

438
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,725
Speaker 3:  the game to you inside of that app. Which they were somewhat able

439
00:26:24,725 --> 00:26:28,685
Speaker 3:  to do on the web. Like they were creaking their way towards being able to

440
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:32,365
Speaker 3:  do this on the web. Yeah. But if you basically have a cat like Netflix,

441
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:35,805
Speaker 3:  like Netflix has a catalog of titles in the thing and you push the button.

442
00:26:36,165 --> 00:26:40,095
Speaker 3:  I think what Apple's saying is everything has to, I think this

443
00:26:40,095 --> 00:26:40,535
Speaker 3:  is like a three

444
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:46,345
Speaker 3:  don't every song on Spotify. Right? But if

445
00:26:46,345 --> 00:26:50,065
Speaker 3:  Spotify is found to break the app store rules, that's a problem.

446
00:26:50,065 --> 00:26:53,985
Speaker 3:  Right? And like I don't, and Spotify is real testy about that, but they

447
00:26:53,985 --> 00:26:57,785
Speaker 3:  don't review every movie on Netflix. But Netflix, I'm assuming if Netflix

448
00:26:57,785 --> 00:27:01,585
Speaker 3:  added a hardcore pornography section like Apple would like get

449
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:05,305
Speaker 3:  in the game. You know what I mean? So I think there's a little bit of back

450
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:05,785
Speaker 3:  and forth there.

451
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,625
Speaker 6:  Can you imagine if Netflix opens an alternative app marketplace

452
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,345
Speaker 6:  in Europe that's just hardcore

453
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:17,625
Speaker 3:  Like with ads in four in four 20 p at four 8:00 PM

454
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:17,945
Speaker 3:  Unless you

455
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:20,185
Speaker 6:  They're listen, we gotta get that RP up somehow. Like let's go

456
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:20,785
Speaker 3:  Every day

457
00:27:22,485 --> 00:27:25,825
Speaker 3:  for a while. The HPO Go app was the singular

458
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:29,945
Speaker 3:  exception to the app store rules. Oh. Because it just had the late night

459
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:31,185
Speaker 3:  category. Oh

460
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:32,145
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So it did have

461
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:35,785
Speaker 3:  Porn, it did well. Very like VHS level

462
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:36,985
Speaker 3:  pornography porn of

463
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:38,385
Speaker 7:  Your 14. Yeah.

464
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:39,825
Speaker 3:  Well

465
00:27:40,655 --> 00:27:41,425
Speaker 7:  Port of you're 12.

466
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:46,545
Speaker 3:  No, I was going the other direction out. You want that number to go

467
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:46,785
Speaker 3:  up?

468
00:27:49,525 --> 00:27:53,385
Speaker 3:  That's we're looking for up 18 is like the real That's the line.

469
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:56,225
Speaker 3:  That's the actual spot. Yeah. but it was a, it was like a huge except and

470
00:27:56,385 --> 00:28:00,105
Speaker 3:  everyone knew it. It was just like unspoken. Well Apple wants the HBO Go

471
00:28:00,105 --> 00:28:03,425
Speaker 3:  app here and HBO's like our whole catalog's here. Including that part of

472
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:07,065
Speaker 3:  it, huh? Yeah. Everyone was like, why don't worry about it.

473
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,145
Speaker 3:  Why is this here?

474
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:09,185
Speaker 7:  Don't

475
00:28:09,185 --> 00:28:12,665
Speaker 3:  Worry about it. And no one would ever talk about it. It's gone now the this,

476
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:16,225
Speaker 3:  the late night skin and max section of the

477
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:20,585
Speaker 3:  max app does not exist. But that would, that was the level of loophole

478
00:28:20,585 --> 00:28:23,785
Speaker 3:  that existed. Yeah. Now that's a free for all. But I, I'm just gonna come

479
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,625
Speaker 3:  back to game streaming. I think that's gonna be the same deal, right?

480
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:31,505
Speaker 3:  You have a catalog, we're gonna spot check the catalog. Like once you

481
00:28:31,505 --> 00:28:35,425
Speaker 3:  get to Microsoft and you the entire Xbox library, there's just

482
00:28:35,605 --> 00:28:39,575
Speaker 3:  no way Apple's like, we're enabling this globally and we're

483
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:42,495
Speaker 3:  gonna, they're enabling 'cause they think there's gonna be a, a pot of gold

484
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:44,895
Speaker 3:  at the end of that rainbow. Right? They're gonna find some way to charge

485
00:28:44,895 --> 00:28:48,615
Speaker 3:  money inside of that app. Well they, they want it to be successful in the

486
00:28:48,615 --> 00:28:49,055
Speaker 3:  iPhone. They

487
00:28:49,055 --> 00:28:52,055
Speaker 7:  Also rolled out that thing, one of the payment structures I think in the

488
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:55,895
Speaker 7:  EU now as if you have over a million downloads, you have to start paying

489
00:28:55,895 --> 00:28:59,735
Speaker 7:  like a monthly like 50 cent fee or something per download.

490
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:00,655
Speaker 7:  Maybe. it was per annual.

491
00:29:00,765 --> 00:29:01,975
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's once a year. Once

492
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:05,615
Speaker 7:  A year. And so like game streaming really takes off in the EU that could,

493
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:09,255
Speaker 7:  that could get pricey. They claim that most people aren't gonna have to pay

494
00:29:09,255 --> 00:29:09,655
Speaker 7:  that though.

495
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:14,215
Speaker 3:  I think what they're anticipating is there's Xbox

496
00:29:14,225 --> 00:29:18,055
Speaker 3:  Cloud gaming and that's an app on your phone. And to get Xbox Cloud gaming,

497
00:29:18,115 --> 00:29:21,895
Speaker 3:  you gotta pay 40 bucks a month. I don know some number. Yeah.

498
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:23,455
Speaker 3:  20 bucks a month and then it

499
00:29:23,455 --> 00:29:24,415
Speaker 7:  Starts at like 20. Yeah.

500
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:28,415
Speaker 3:  And the best way to get that customer to convert is for them to

501
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:32,295
Speaker 3:  sign up with an in-app purchase in a subscription. And so Apple's just

502
00:29:32,295 --> 00:29:35,255
Speaker 3:  gonna take that money. It is like, great, here's a thing we want you to do.

503
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:35,775
Speaker 3:  Apple

504
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:38,615
Speaker 6:  Looked at this and said people are gonna get this subscription one way or

505
00:29:38,615 --> 00:29:42,445
Speaker 6:  another. Why don't we make them do it on our phone?

506
00:29:43,065 --> 00:29:46,845
Speaker 3:  Why don't we take our 30% there? Do you think there's just a

507
00:29:46,845 --> 00:29:50,525
Speaker 3:  line of people outside of Tim Cook's office that was like, just like ideas

508
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:54,205
Speaker 3:  to collect 30%. A hundred percent. You know, there's like the VIP line

509
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:58,245
Speaker 3:  for the executives that he knows. Like there's like water, there's a guy,

510
00:29:58,355 --> 00:30:02,045
Speaker 3:  there's like people I know problems. I have to solve ideas to take

511
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:05,485
Speaker 3:  30% and just like one after another. They just have three different tickets

512
00:30:05,585 --> 00:30:09,125
Speaker 3:  and they're, you know, his receptionist is like now serving

513
00:30:09,335 --> 00:30:13,005
Speaker 3:  56 and ideas for 30% and someone just like shuffles in

514
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:16,445
Speaker 3:  this is my time to shine 80 Q was just like tapping his foot, just like waiting.

515
00:30:19,645 --> 00:30:23,565
Speaker 3:  'cause that they want Apple to and Google. Now as

516
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:27,365
Speaker 3:  we know from Google's own antitrust trial, every button

517
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:30,725
Speaker 3:  you push on your phone is an opportunity for them to make money. Yep. And

518
00:30:30,725 --> 00:30:34,005
Speaker 3:  if they don't make them money, they're mad. And I think that should bring

519
00:30:34,005 --> 00:30:37,285
Speaker 3:  us to how mad they are at the European Union. Yes. Because you mentioned

520
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:40,045
Speaker 3:  the press release and we haven't even read the, we're mad lines in the press

521
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:40,325
Speaker 3:  release.

522
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:44,045
Speaker 6:  Well, so Apple's big story has always been

523
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:48,485
Speaker 6:  that only Apple can provide a

524
00:30:48,635 --> 00:30:52,245
Speaker 6:  protected, good, curated successful

525
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:56,245
Speaker 6:  experience for everybody that makes everyone happy and

526
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:59,525
Speaker 6:  doesn't steal all of your information and kill you and leave you in a ditch.

527
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:03,485
Speaker 6:  Like those are the two options. It's it's Apple or ditch, right? Like

528
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:05,045
Speaker 6:  that's in Apple's world that's what it's,

529
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:10,525
Speaker 6:  there's never been any real evidence that that is the case. But here

530
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:14,485
Speaker 6:  we are. So with the, with the browser one,

531
00:31:16,715 --> 00:31:19,295
Speaker 6:  one of the things that happens with the browser now is the first time you

532
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:22,895
Speaker 6:  open Safari after updating to iOS 17.4,

533
00:31:23,275 --> 00:31:26,535
Speaker 6:  you're gonna get a choice screen, which we know for sure Apple hates. Apple

534
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:30,455
Speaker 6:  has testified under Oath, vivid hates choice screens. And you're gonna boot

535
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,615
Speaker 6:  up Safari and it's gonna say, what do you want to be your default browser?

536
00:31:32,645 --> 00:31:36,335
Speaker 6:  This is again only in the EU and you're gonna be able to pick Safari or

537
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:39,135
Speaker 6:  a list of other browsers I think to be named later.

538
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:44,495
Speaker 6:  And Apple says this changes the result of the DMAs requirements and means

539
00:31:44,495 --> 00:31:47,695
Speaker 6:  that EU users will be confronted with a list of default browsers before they

540
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:51,015
Speaker 6:  have the opportunity to understand the options available to them. The screen

541
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:54,695
Speaker 6:  also in interrupts EU users' experience the first time they open Safari

542
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:58,415
Speaker 6:  intending to navigate to a webpage. Yeah. It's just this like passive

543
00:31:58,425 --> 00:32:02,295
Speaker 6:  aggressive, like this is a bunch of bullshit. Look what you guys are making

544
00:32:02,315 --> 00:32:06,175
Speaker 6:  us do. This is stupid. I hate it. That's the vibe.

545
00:32:06,455 --> 00:32:06,735
Speaker 6:  I love it.

546
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:10,415
Speaker 3:  Here's here's what I will point out one that is true. Yeah. And it's great

547
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:14,455
Speaker 3:  to just to go like I'm not saying you should do this. Go

548
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:17,415
Speaker 3:  get an AI voice clone of your favorite Apple executive. I'm happy to read

549
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:18,215
Speaker 3:  that copy. It's great.

550
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:23,055
Speaker 3:  Don't do that. That's totally legal and morally questionable. But in the

551
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:24,695
Speaker 3:  new EU app stores totally available to you.

552
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,655
Speaker 3:  The thing that's funny about that is Apple is a hundred percent correct in

553
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:33,535
Speaker 3:  the context of choice screens as we've known them up until now. They've been

554
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:37,375
Speaker 3:  putting choice screens on Android and Windows in the EU for 1 billion

555
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:41,165
Speaker 3:  years. And you know what, people are still using

556
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:41,805
Speaker 3:  Chrome. Yep.

557
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:46,165
Speaker 7:  They use choice screens in app like Mac oss

558
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:50,085
Speaker 7:  right now if you go and you open a new browser and you're like I wanna use

559
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:52,885
Speaker 7:  this one, they're like, you sure? Like they still double check that stuff.

560
00:32:52,885 --> 00:32:53,565
Speaker 7:  So, I don't. Well

561
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:54,605
Speaker 3:  Every browser wants you be a default.

562
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:58,525
Speaker 7:  They all, yeah, they all want that. And Apple's always like, Hmm. Really?

563
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,325
Speaker 7:  So it, it's one of those things where I was like this, okay, I get it. You

564
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:04,925
Speaker 7:  guys are mad. But also choice is good that

565
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:08,805
Speaker 3:  Well no, but this, this is the thing. So the argument is the EU has in MA

566
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:12,485
Speaker 3:  like trying to get people on Windows and Android. Yeah.

567
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:16,245
Speaker 3:  To not not use, use Chrome or Google search

568
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:20,725
Speaker 3:  for 1 billion years. Like Yep. You, you open

569
00:33:20,725 --> 00:33:23,125
Speaker 3:  it, it's like what search engine would you like to use? Your choices are

570
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:26,565
Speaker 3:  Google and 500 Choices and everyone's like don don't know Google. Or you

571
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:28,765
Speaker 3:  open up a thing and it's like what browser do you wanna use? Your choices

572
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:31,885
Speaker 3:  are inner Explorer Chrome or 5 billion other options. Bing. And they're like

573
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:35,805
Speaker 3:  Chrome. And that's very interesting in this context

574
00:33:37,055 --> 00:33:40,585
Speaker 3:  because people are gonna open up their iPhones and it's gonna say do you

575
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,305
Speaker 3:  want to use Safari or Chrome? The thing people in the EU

576
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:48,185
Speaker 3:  have been picking over and over and over again for 1 billion years.

577
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,265
Speaker 7:  See I don't think that's what's gonna happen. I don think it's gonna be Safari,

578
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:55,705
Speaker 7:  Firefox Opera Arc

579
00:33:56,655 --> 00:34:00,425
Speaker 7:  Duck Duck Go probably has a browser. Yeah. And then like when you

580
00:34:00,565 --> 00:34:03,625
Speaker 7:  scroll down past the top there will be go

581
00:34:03,905 --> 00:34:05,585
Speaker 6:  Like spelled wrong and in a

582
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:09,425
Speaker 3:  Different font. Yes. But the cutting edge of European politics is that

583
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:13,145
Speaker 3:  these choice trains are legally required to be randomized. Oh.

584
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,545
Speaker 3:  And everyone still picks Chrome.

585
00:34:16,425 --> 00:34:19,945
Speaker 3:  I just want to be clear. People they've tried, they're like, what if it was

586
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:23,225
Speaker 3:  a random choice screen? What if the choice screen paid you $5 to not pick

587
00:34:23,225 --> 00:34:26,665
Speaker 3:  Chrome and they're like Chrome. And so this is the first time you're gonna

588
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:30,625
Speaker 3:  get the experiment where the, the goal is to get people

589
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:34,705
Speaker 3:  away from the default to the other default that the

590
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:38,305
Speaker 3:  European Union has been trying to get people away from forever. And it, I

591
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:40,065
Speaker 3:  am dying to know what happens. I

592
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:44,145
Speaker 7:  Re like I hope somebody chooses Internet Explorer. I hope somebody go make

593
00:34:44,145 --> 00:34:45,105
Speaker 7:  that app right now. Just

594
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:48,585
Speaker 3:  An old school Internet Explorer. Yeah. Like but the old Mac version with

595
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:51,905
Speaker 3:  like the the Aqua blue bars and the tabs. That would

596
00:34:51,905 --> 00:34:53,465
Speaker 6:  Be beautiful. Absolutely. Same.

597
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:53,785
Speaker 7:  Sold.

598
00:34:53,785 --> 00:34:54,065
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

599
00:34:54,645 --> 00:34:56,545
Speaker 6:  An old ass browser should be one of the options.

600
00:34:56,985 --> 00:35:00,065
Speaker 3:  IE three is gonna be rocking and rolling on this thing. Wait,

601
00:35:00,085 --> 00:35:03,785
Speaker 6:  Can I just read you one more saucy line from the press release? So this is,

602
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:06,745
Speaker 6:  this is the big like omnibus

603
00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:10,785
Speaker 6:  giant press release from Apple announcing all of the changes that begrudgingly

604
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:14,705
Speaker 6:  made at the beginning of, or sorry, at the end of the first paragraph it

605
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:18,625
Speaker 6:  says across every change Apple is introducing new safeguards that reduce

606
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:22,345
Speaker 6:  but don't eliminate new risks. The DMA poses to EU users.

607
00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:28,625
Speaker 6:  It's like the ddu, the DMA is trying to ruin your life and Apple is

608
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:31,665
Speaker 6:  doing its best to stop it but we can't solve everything.

609
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:33,545
Speaker 6:  Thanks the EU.

610
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:38,125
Speaker 3:  There's a real, that's so good dichotomy here, right? Like Apple's pissed

611
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:42,085
Speaker 3:  that EU is me, those European regulators are telling us how to work our

612
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:45,205
Speaker 3:  phone and then inside of that is buried because you're too stupid to figure

613
00:35:45,205 --> 00:35:46,445
Speaker 3:  it out yourself. Right? And it's like,

614
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:48,725
Speaker 3:  I don't know man,

615
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:54,605
Speaker 3:  I have a Mac, I can do whatever I want on this Mac going

616
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:58,045
Speaker 3:  pretty good. You know, like the mitigations you put on the Mac working pretty

617
00:35:58,045 --> 00:36:01,485
Speaker 3:  well. Why can't my phone work this way? And I,

618
00:36:02,445 --> 00:36:05,805
Speaker 3:  I think that moralizing, and we should talk about this in the context of

619
00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:08,365
Speaker 3:  like Vision Pro apps or we have talked it in the context of Vision Pro like

620
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:11,165
Speaker 3:  Netflix and YouTube just like not being there. Yeah. All those developers

621
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:14,845
Speaker 3:  are pissed it at, they do not have the goodwill to make this argument. And

622
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:18,685
Speaker 3:  people have headphones for a very, very long time and they know

623
00:36:18,685 --> 00:36:22,245
Speaker 3:  that Apple's like more like they understand how the phones work. Like

624
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:24,525
Speaker 3:  Apple's moralizing is kinda like falling on deaf ears

625
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:30,245
Speaker 3:  weird. It's just a weird moment for Apple, which historically has gotten

626
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:32,085
Speaker 3:  developers to do whatever it wants.

627
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:35,725
Speaker 6:  That was actually one thing about this announcement that surprised me was

628
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:39,525
Speaker 6:  how little of an olive branch to developers it actually

629
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:43,965
Speaker 6:  appeared to be, you would think at this moment with

630
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:47,725
Speaker 6:  The Vision Pro coming out. And I think there's real momentum

631
00:36:47,745 --> 00:36:51,365
Speaker 6:  behind the idea of not playing Apple's developer games anymore. I mean

632
00:36:51,605 --> 00:36:55,205
Speaker 6:  it Netflix has been kind of an edge case for a long time. Spotify and Epic

633
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:58,925
Speaker 6:  have been mad for a long time, but like YouTube

634
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:02,885
Speaker 6:  and others saying we're gonna wait and see and the the line they all

635
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:06,805
Speaker 6:  give is we don't know what this platform is gonna be. I think Netflix co

636
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,085
Speaker 6:  CEO Yeah Greg

637
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:12,045
Speaker 7:  Peters this week was like, we'll see if like, if it actually takes off

638
00:37:12,045 --> 00:37:15,485
Speaker 7:  we might consider it but we're not gonna invest time and money into something

639
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:18,445
Speaker 7:  that's not like guaranteed to be good. Right.

640
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,805
Speaker 6:  Which is a perfectly valid excuse but it iss also not what people say about

641
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:24,565
Speaker 6:  Apple. Like do you remember when the iPad came out and everyone on earth

642
00:37:24,595 --> 00:37:28,285
Speaker 6:  like fell over themselves trying to get on the iPad app store? It's like

643
00:37:28,355 --> 00:37:32,045
Speaker 6:  that is the thing Apple is very good at. And this is the

644
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:34,885
Speaker 6:  opposite of that. And So I would've thought in this moment Apple would've

645
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,645
Speaker 6:  said, what's what can we do that will in reality

646
00:37:38,745 --> 00:37:42,725
Speaker 6:  or in appearance feel like kind of a love letter to

647
00:37:42,725 --> 00:37:45,325
Speaker 6:  developers in the same way that like every five years they release a new

648
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:48,405
Speaker 6:  Mac Pro to remind people that they love people who have macros

649
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:52,765
Speaker 6:  and there just didn't seem to be any of that. Well

650
00:37:52,765 --> 00:37:55,965
Speaker 7:  When you're an effective monopoly, you don't have to do

651
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:59,405
Speaker 7:  that. You don't have to play nice because they're still one of the biggest

652
00:37:59,465 --> 00:38:02,805
Speaker 7:  app stores. They're still one of the biggest platforms. They can just say,

653
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:05,925
Speaker 7:  yeah, do it. Netflix is still gonna have to be on the iPhone, it's still

654
00:38:05,925 --> 00:38:09,725
Speaker 7:  gonna have to be on the iPad because those are huge. Right? So like this

655
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:13,085
Speaker 7:  is definitely one of those moments where I feel like 10, 15 years from now,

656
00:38:13,345 --> 00:38:16,525
Speaker 7:  if there's some additional turns, we're gonna look back on this moment and

657
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:19,845
Speaker 7:  be like, oh this is where Apple really started to like it's hubris started

658
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:23,725
Speaker 7:  to show and it really started to have like kind of a decline. Yeah. But I

659
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:27,245
Speaker 7:  don't know if that's actually gonna happen, but I could certainly see talking

660
00:38:27,245 --> 00:38:29,325
Speaker 7:  about it in a podcast 15 years from

661
00:38:29,325 --> 00:38:33,275
Speaker 3:  Now. Well I think one that we should end it by figurine out.

662
00:38:33,275 --> 00:38:36,445
Speaker 3:  Like how, how do we measure success here? Like here's the thing, I think

663
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:40,395
Speaker 3:  we have a big team in Europe and they are very quick to

664
00:38:40,395 --> 00:38:43,715
Speaker 3:  remind me that one, they get more holidays, they get healthcare,

665
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:49,475
Speaker 3:  they're always on top of that. And then, you know, they pay nothing for internet

666
00:38:49,475 --> 00:38:53,155
Speaker 3:  service. Like you wanna buy broadband in Europe, you're not paying as much

667
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:55,515
Speaker 3:  money as if you wanna buy broadband in the United States. And it's faster.

668
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:55,915
Speaker 3:  Like,

669
00:38:56,095 --> 00:38:58,715
Speaker 7:  But no air conditioning. What's that about? Whatcha are you

670
00:38:58,715 --> 00:39:00,755
Speaker 3:  Guys doing over there? Well, climate change has arrived for the Europeans.

671
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:03,835
Speaker 3:  We ran a great story several years ago about air conditioners in France.

672
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:06,235
Speaker 3:  We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll we'll dig it up and link it in the show notes.

673
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:12,195
Speaker 3:  But like there are ways to measure like how

674
00:39:12,635 --> 00:39:16,195
Speaker 3:  European regulations raise or lower prices or lead to different outcomes.

675
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:21,035
Speaker 3:  Some of them are worse than here. Like there are some

676
00:39:21,035 --> 00:39:24,955
Speaker 3:  aspects of like European regulation that have led to less

677
00:39:24,955 --> 00:39:28,155
Speaker 3:  vibrant marketplaces for sure. Like we have big tech companies.

678
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:32,075
Speaker 3:  Europe does not, that's just a, that's just true.

679
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:36,035
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You can read all kinds of academic literature on why that has happened,

680
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:40,235
Speaker 3:  but it mostly is because you can just go start a Google

681
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:43,275
Speaker 3:  in a garage here and then maybe take over a giant market,

682
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,475
Speaker 3:  right? You you can just monopoly your way up to that position if you want

683
00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:49,995
Speaker 3:  here and we won't stop you. And in Europe they just like don't, it doesn't

684
00:39:49,995 --> 00:39:53,955
Speaker 3:  happen that same way labor unions sit on the boards of big European companies.

685
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:57,515
Speaker 3:  That doesn't happen here. So you just end up, you can make lists of pros

686
00:39:57,515 --> 00:40:01,355
Speaker 3:  and cons, but in this case I think we don't know what success looks like.

687
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:03,755
Speaker 3:  don don't know that the Europeans don't, they're just like, competition is

688
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:06,875
Speaker 3:  good, which is great. I love it. I'm all about competition.

689
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:11,645
Speaker 3:  But it's like at the end of this is it you need to

690
00:40:12,005 --> 00:40:15,285
Speaker 3:  download a different app store to get Spotify and Netflix in the Kindle app

691
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,885
Speaker 3:  and then there's a bunch of weird stuff in the Apple App store. Like honestly

692
00:40:18,945 --> 00:40:19,605
Speaker 3:  is that success?

693
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:23,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think success is, oh I can just go buy a book or an

694
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:27,605
Speaker 7:  audio book or a movie or whatever and just do it and just be done

695
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:31,565
Speaker 7:  with it on the app. I choose like, I think that is, I think that is a, a

696
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:35,365
Speaker 7:  victory and oh I can just go have real chrome on my

697
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:35,765
Speaker 7:  iPhone

698
00:40:36,055 --> 00:40:36,605
Speaker 3:  Agree there.

699
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:40,205
Speaker 7:  So So I think Yeah, I think, I think we're gonna pretty quickly see the victories.

700
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:43,125
Speaker 7:  I think what's gonna be interesting is, is all the economics afterwards and,

701
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:46,285
Speaker 7:  and, and then we'll we'll see the losses of like, oh we just have like a

702
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:49,965
Speaker 7:  whole really gross revenge porn app. Yeah. Just

703
00:40:49,965 --> 00:40:53,885
Speaker 7:  hanging out on a store and, and now we're gonna be having to like

704
00:40:53,975 --> 00:40:57,525
Speaker 7:  write a bunch of stories about this app store who refuses to take down the

705
00:40:57,525 --> 00:41:00,765
Speaker 7:  revenge porn app. You know, that's gonna suck, that's gonna happen. don,

706
00:41:00,765 --> 00:41:04,125
Speaker 7:  don't do that. Don't do it people. But when you do, I hate you

707
00:41:04,955 --> 00:41:05,565
Speaker 7:  just know that.

708
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:10,125
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I I think figurine out like what does it look like if this worked?

709
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:13,125
Speaker 3:  Like what are the tangible improvements we want to have with our experiences

710
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:17,045
Speaker 3:  with our phones and yeah, I just wanna be able to buy stuff. I

711
00:41:17,045 --> 00:41:20,965
Speaker 3:  want the user experience of buying content to be simpler and easier and not

712
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:24,725
Speaker 3:  feel like Apple's just taking a 30% cut from whatever creator.

713
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:29,325
Speaker 3:  That's pretty good. Yeah, I'll, I'll I'll take that. On the flip side, if

714
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:33,485
Speaker 3:  to do that you do need to go download a separate app store for every

715
00:41:33,485 --> 00:41:37,405
Speaker 3:  kind of content app that's, that's like obviously worse. Yeah. And

716
00:41:37,405 --> 00:41:40,965
Speaker 3:  I, I think Apple is leaning towards it's gonna be chaos and you're gonna

717
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:44,605
Speaker 3:  want to be here anyway and I think we're all leaning towards the pressure

718
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:47,565
Speaker 3:  on Apple will be enough to change the actual app store and make it better

719
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:51,125
Speaker 3:  mean you. 'cause that's what competition does. I, I don't know where we're

720
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:54,205
Speaker 3:  gonna net out. I would just say like at this moment, regardless of how you

721
00:41:54,205 --> 00:41:57,925
Speaker 3:  think, you should just think about like what does success for this thing

722
00:41:57,925 --> 00:42:01,405
Speaker 3:  look like and how do you get there as opposed to it's definitely gonna win

723
00:42:01,405 --> 00:42:04,285
Speaker 3:  or it's definitely gonna be a disaster. 'cause like I said, they've been

724
00:42:04,285 --> 00:42:08,205
Speaker 3:  putting choice screens on Windows and Android for years. Like

725
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:12,125
Speaker 3:  one decade of antitrust regulation in Europe

726
00:42:12,385 --> 00:42:15,605
Speaker 3:  around Google has resulted in no change.

727
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:16,925
Speaker 3:  None

728
00:42:17,005 --> 00:42:17,725
Speaker 8:  Chrome's just

729
00:42:17,725 --> 00:42:17,965
Speaker 3:  Great.

730
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:22,925
Speaker 3:  I think it is gonna be wild to put the Chrome icon on a choice screen and

731
00:42:22,925 --> 00:42:24,485
Speaker 3:  an iPhone and see if people still pick

732
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:28,085
Speaker 6:  Safari. That's a really interesting test case here, right? Like the, the

733
00:42:28,085 --> 00:42:31,965
Speaker 6:  thing that I think is interesting here is we've been talking sort of in

734
00:42:31,965 --> 00:42:35,925
Speaker 6:  theory for a long time about whether people would just pick the

735
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:39,765
Speaker 6:  app store both developers and users because it's easier, right? Like

736
00:42:39,805 --> 00:42:43,485
Speaker 6:  I, I think you can make a very compelling case that all of the stuff that

737
00:42:43,485 --> 00:42:46,925
Speaker 6:  it's going to entail to go to the website of an app marketplace,

738
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:51,685
Speaker 6:  download it, go through the hoops to get it installed, say yes on that scary

739
00:42:51,685 --> 00:42:55,525
Speaker 6:  screen that's like you're downloading another app store, you might die and

740
00:42:55,525 --> 00:42:59,125
Speaker 6:  then download the other apps, do all the stuff there, maintain those things

741
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:02,525
Speaker 6:  like that might be arduous enough that most people will continue to choose

742
00:43:02,525 --> 00:43:06,045
Speaker 6:  the app store, which is what Apple has said all along is the case. And now

743
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:09,765
Speaker 6:  we get to find out like that's the thing I'm excited about. And and the Chrome

744
00:43:10,075 --> 00:43:13,925
Speaker 6:  example is a perfect one because Google's whole defense in

745
00:43:13,945 --> 00:43:17,565
Speaker 6:  its antitrust case has been people use us because we're the best product

746
00:43:18,025 --> 00:43:21,205
Speaker 6:  and we know because when people get to choose, even when they're bullied

747
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:24,965
Speaker 6:  into choosing, they choose us. And that's a pretty good

748
00:43:25,115 --> 00:43:29,085
Speaker 6:  antitrust defense. Or at least it has seemed like one so far. And in

749
00:43:29,085 --> 00:43:33,045
Speaker 6:  this case, apple is is gonna have to put up or shut up along the

750
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:36,245
Speaker 6:  same lines like we're about to find out how many people use Safari on purpose

751
00:43:36,665 --> 00:43:37,845
Speaker 6:  and I think that's cool.

752
00:43:38,275 --> 00:43:38,565
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

753
00:43:38,635 --> 00:43:38,925
Speaker 6:  It's

754
00:43:38,925 --> 00:43:42,165
Speaker 3:  Me. All right. That's a great place to end it 'cause I am dying to the answer

755
00:43:42,185 --> 00:43:46,125
Speaker 3:  and we just won't know until our European friends tell us

756
00:43:47,265 --> 00:43:50,845
Speaker 3:  we we gotta take a break. We're this show is already way over. We'll be right

757
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:51,005
Speaker 3:  back.

758
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:14,205
Speaker 3:  We're back. We, we still have a lot talk. This show's gonna go it's five

759
00:47:14,205 --> 00:47:18,045
Speaker 3:  hours. Yeah, but there's like a lot of streaming news this week. Cranz,

760
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:18,525
Speaker 3:  what's going on?

761
00:47:18,675 --> 00:47:22,645
Speaker 7:  Okay, so Netflix had their earnings but before their earnings they had a

762
00:47:22,645 --> 00:47:26,485
Speaker 7:  bunch of other stuff happen. So first up, Scott Staub, who was the

763
00:47:26,645 --> 00:47:29,995
Speaker 7:  chairman for Netflix Films, announced he was leaving leaving, that was the

764
00:47:29,995 --> 00:47:33,915
Speaker 7:  day before. And, and Scott is like not the only

765
00:47:33,915 --> 00:47:37,795
Speaker 7:  reason that Netflix has a really successful film slate, but was

766
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:41,155
Speaker 7:  a big reason that they were like the most nominated film studio for three

767
00:47:41,155 --> 00:47:44,755
Speaker 7:  years in a row. So, so him leaving Ooh surprising

768
00:47:45,185 --> 00:47:49,085
Speaker 7:  then the morning before their earnings,

769
00:47:49,085 --> 00:47:52,805
Speaker 7:  they announced that WWE Monday night Raw was gonna be coming

770
00:47:52,805 --> 00:47:56,485
Speaker 7:  exclusively to Netflix and not only Netflix in the United States, but

771
00:47:56,495 --> 00:48:00,445
Speaker 7:  world worldwide, which is apparently very huge according to

772
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:04,125
Speaker 7:  Chris Welch, our resident. Like WWE Superfan. Yeah.

773
00:48:04,725 --> 00:48:08,565
Speaker 7:  I had to, I had to go to him repeatedly this week being like, explain this

774
00:48:08,565 --> 00:48:12,325
Speaker 7:  wrestling thing to me. But so, so those are both

775
00:48:12,325 --> 00:48:15,965
Speaker 7:  like big things. And then they announced at their, after

776
00:48:15,965 --> 00:48:19,045
Speaker 7:  during their earnings report, they announced that they were gonna be getting

777
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:23,005
Speaker 7:  rid of the 1199 basic plan, which they had already

778
00:48:23,005 --> 00:48:25,925
Speaker 7:  been like phasing out I believe in the United States and a couple other places.

779
00:48:26,185 --> 00:48:30,125
Speaker 7:  Now it's going away everywhere before, like you couldn't

780
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:33,965
Speaker 7:  even subscribe to it, but if you had already subscribed, you were fine. Now

781
00:48:33,965 --> 00:48:37,645
Speaker 7:  you're gonna get bumped either to 6 99, which is the ad for, which is the

782
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:41,565
Speaker 7:  ad version or you're gonna get bumped to 1549, which is the

783
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:45,285
Speaker 7:  ad free version. Oh my gosh. So it just got a lot more expensive

784
00:48:45,285 --> 00:48:48,205
Speaker 7:  basically to, to go without ads on Netflix. I

785
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:48,685
Speaker 6:  Just like to say

786
00:48:48,685 --> 00:48:49,445
Speaker 7:  That's the real, just,

787
00:48:49,765 --> 00:48:53,645
Speaker 6:  I just like to say I I theorized that that

788
00:48:53,645 --> 00:48:57,245
Speaker 6:  was going to happen on this podcast. Yeah, you did. And oh my God, have I

789
00:48:57,245 --> 00:49:01,205
Speaker 6:  been right? That they're just going to price you to pieces if you

790
00:49:01,235 --> 00:49:04,925
Speaker 6:  want ad free and you want 4K and they're gonna keep the

791
00:49:05,265 --> 00:49:09,205
Speaker 6:  ad, the, the ad based one cheap and eventually they're just going to

792
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:11,205
Speaker 6:  shove everybody down to that one.

793
00:49:11,265 --> 00:49:14,405
Speaker 7:  And that's not entirely their plan, but that's a big part of the plan for

794
00:49:14,405 --> 00:49:17,005
Speaker 7:  them. They've got about 23, it sounds like. They've got about 23 million

795
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:21,045
Speaker 7:  monthly active users who are currently on advertising. They really, really

796
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:24,685
Speaker 7:  like it. All those people love it 'cause they pay 6 99 and they get two screens

797
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:28,445
Speaker 7:  and they can watch it, but now they're gonna have to pay 1549 if they want

798
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:31,805
Speaker 7:  those two screens and no ads. And then if they want four screens

799
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:36,205
Speaker 7:  and 4K, they have to pay 2299. And then for each

800
00:49:36,335 --> 00:49:40,325
Speaker 7:  additional user, so like if when Max goes

801
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:42,685
Speaker 7:  to college NELI next week,

802
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:47,285
Speaker 7:  7 99 per user, per month for tho those, those

803
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:48,165
Speaker 7:  higher ones, which

804
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:52,005
Speaker 3:  Is just, I can, I, I find it disgusting that they charge

805
00:49:52,105 --> 00:49:53,245
Speaker 3:  per user and per screen.

806
00:49:54,135 --> 00:49:57,105
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's, it's a lot. I'm, I'm really curious. Like

807
00:49:57,105 --> 00:49:59,745
Speaker 3:  Even the cable companies weren't like per screen.

808
00:50:00,385 --> 00:50:03,705
Speaker 6:  I I mean they kind of were, you had to get another box if you wanted another

809
00:50:03,705 --> 00:50:04,025
Speaker 6:  screen.

810
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:07,185
Speaker 7:  Yeah, no, they were, yeah. You had to get the box and they'd be like, that

811
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:09,265
Speaker 7:  box is a hundred dollars.

812
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:12,065
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Well, basic cable was not per screen.

813
00:50:12,705 --> 00:50:13,025
Speaker 7:  I never,

814
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:16,345
Speaker 3:  You could put, you could basic, you could splitter a basic cable subscription

815
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:17,545
Speaker 3:  to 5,000 screens.

816
00:50:17,705 --> 00:50:21,145
Speaker 7:  I, I never lived in a region where I could do that. It was always I had to

817
00:50:21,145 --> 00:50:21,905
Speaker 7:  have the little box.

818
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:22,545
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

819
00:50:23,295 --> 00:50:26,545
Speaker 6:  NELI, you're definitely the kind of person who would've like pirated TBS

820
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:28,925
Speaker 6:  for your whole neighborhood growing up like that. That feels right.

821
00:50:29,245 --> 00:50:32,845
Speaker 3:  I am 100% the kind of person who figured out how to steal cable in the dorm

822
00:50:32,845 --> 00:50:36,805
Speaker 3:  and met his wife that way. Aw, I'm just letting you know that I had a little

823
00:50:36,955 --> 00:50:40,805
Speaker 3:  coax crimper. The, the whole thing. It's a, it was a drop. Gee,

824
00:50:40,965 --> 00:50:43,045
Speaker 3:  I just looked in the ceiling, you know, I was, there it is. Let's see what

825
00:50:43,045 --> 00:50:43,205
Speaker 3:  happens.

826
00:50:44,105 --> 00:50:45,405
Speaker 7:  It was a real cable guy moment.

827
00:50:47,255 --> 00:50:49,485
Speaker 3:  Sorry. I was a cool cable guy. All right.

828
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:52,685
Speaker 6:  But wait, Alex, you and I had basically the same exact reaction to this,

829
00:50:52,685 --> 00:50:56,325
Speaker 6:  which is just that Netflix is just a whole ass cable company now.

830
00:50:56,475 --> 00:50:59,885
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. So, so Netflix is effectively cable because Ted Sarandos, the

831
00:50:59,925 --> 00:51:03,685
Speaker 7:  CEO, Greg Peters, the other CEO and the CFO, we're all like, well, yeah,

832
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:07,205
Speaker 7:  we have all this secondary programming, IE the suits, the young

833
00:51:07,205 --> 00:51:11,085
Speaker 7:  Sheldon, the stuff they're not making and they just buy a license for, and

834
00:51:11,085 --> 00:51:14,285
Speaker 7:  that makes them a lot of money. And with advertising that makes them more

835
00:51:14,285 --> 00:51:17,085
Speaker 7:  money than, than original programming where they're having to spend billions

836
00:51:17,085 --> 00:51:20,205
Speaker 7:  of their own dollars to make it. And even that original programming is the

837
00:51:20,595 --> 00:51:24,485
Speaker 7:  most of their tops watch stuff. It's not all of their top watch

838
00:51:24,485 --> 00:51:28,445
Speaker 7:  stuff. And your business, it's cheaper to buy young

839
00:51:28,445 --> 00:51:32,085
Speaker 7:  Sheldon and and throw that up to your 200 something

840
00:51:32,195 --> 00:51:32,685
Speaker 7:  million.

841
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:36,085
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The 45th time CBS has sold young Sheldon, they're selling it for cheap.

842
00:51:36,155 --> 00:51:36,445
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

843
00:51:36,465 --> 00:51:40,115
Speaker 7:  And you could still watch Young Sheldon on Paramount Plus if you want. 'cause

844
00:51:40,315 --> 00:51:43,435
Speaker 7:  I do. I don't, I watch lots of things there. Not young

845
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:47,515
Speaker 3:  Suits. Can I just say Suits is a, a scorge upon the Republic. It's a danger

846
00:51:47,515 --> 00:51:48,555
Speaker 3:  to young people everywhere. It's

847
00:51:48,635 --> 00:51:51,955
Speaker 6:  Terrible. I love suits. I'm so ashamed of how much I like that show.

848
00:51:52,245 --> 00:51:54,995
Speaker 3:  Suits is the stupidest show in the entire world here. My,

849
00:51:54,995 --> 00:51:56,115
Speaker 7:  Is this the lawyer you talking? Well,

850
00:51:56,115 --> 00:52:00,035
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's, it's unwatchable if you are a lawyer, but my little

851
00:52:00,115 --> 00:52:02,955
Speaker 3:  niece is her first semester of college, she was in her first finals in college

852
00:52:03,735 --> 00:52:07,275
Speaker 3:  and she texted me and Becky and was like, should I be a lawyer?

853
00:52:08,235 --> 00:52:12,035
Speaker 3:  'cause it's first finals and she's a STEM major. And I was like, are you

854
00:52:12,035 --> 00:52:14,675
Speaker 3:  just studying for your chem final? And she's like, no. I was watching Suits

855
00:52:14,735 --> 00:52:17,955
Speaker 3:  and I thought, if this doesn't go well. And we were both like, no,

856
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:21,235
Speaker 3:  do not be a lawyer because he wants suits.

857
00:52:24,385 --> 00:52:25,075
Speaker 7:  It's gonna be like,

858
00:52:25,385 --> 00:52:29,315
Speaker 3:  It's not like that. If you take one thing for

859
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:33,115
Speaker 3:  my entire career at The Verge, it's that being a lawyer is not

860
00:52:33,115 --> 00:52:34,315
Speaker 3:  like being on suits

861
00:52:34,695 --> 00:52:37,955
Speaker 6:  Unlike the West Wing, which is a perfect representation of what it's like

862
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:38,195
Speaker 6:  to be

863
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:41,755
Speaker 3:  In politics. No, it's closer. Like the people in

864
00:52:41,755 --> 00:52:45,595
Speaker 3:  politics would like their lives to be. Like the West Wing lawyers

865
00:52:45,735 --> 00:52:48,435
Speaker 3:  are not like, I wish it was more like suits

866
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:52,875
Speaker 6:  There. I will say I've, I've only watched like the first season of Suits

867
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:56,835
Speaker 6:  so far, and a I love it very much. And b no one ever does any

868
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:58,995
Speaker 6:  lawyering in that whole show. I don't think.

869
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:00,595
Speaker 7:  Well 'cause he, they

870
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:02,235
Speaker 6:  Gives cases. Is that what the lawyer, the

871
00:53:02,235 --> 00:53:05,395
Speaker 3:  Entire, the entire plot is that he, Meghan Markle has to find cases for the

872
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:06,595
Speaker 3:  guy. Whatcha talking about?

873
00:53:08,725 --> 00:53:12,455
Speaker 3:  This show's horrible. I watched five episodes. I was like, never again did

874
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:12,535
Speaker 3:  you?

875
00:53:12,535 --> 00:53:13,575
Speaker 7:  But like Gina Torres,

876
00:53:14,395 --> 00:53:17,775
Speaker 3:  I'm saying I'm gonna cancel Netflix. They keep making Americans watch suits.

877
00:53:18,675 --> 00:53:22,575
Speaker 7:  But what's funny is that USA, which is part of Universal,

878
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:26,445
Speaker 7:  which is owns Peacock and I think was maybe an investor in, in

879
00:53:26,445 --> 00:53:27,685
Speaker 7:  US at some point. I don't remember.

880
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:30,045
Speaker 3:  No, no, I will, I have a better disclosure about Suits.

881
00:53:30,045 --> 00:53:30,645
Speaker 7:  Okay, go for it.

882
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:34,125
Speaker 3:  Okay. Right. Suits was on, I'm gonna drink while I want Suits was on USA,

883
00:53:34,695 --> 00:53:38,685
Speaker 3:  right? Yeah. It's owned by NBCUniversal. NBCUniversal is an investor in Fox

884
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:42,605
Speaker 3:  Media, European Company, whatever. The real disclosure is that Suits was

885
00:53:42,605 --> 00:53:46,525
Speaker 3:  the lead into Mr. Robot and I hosted the Mr. Robot after show

886
00:53:46,865 --> 00:53:50,725
Speaker 3:  for many years and I had to watch the tail end of every episode of

887
00:53:50,775 --> 00:53:54,325
Speaker 3:  Suits waiting for Mr. Robot to start so we could have the Mr. Robot Show.

888
00:53:54,325 --> 00:53:57,125
Speaker 3:  And then, do you see what I'm saying? This is a real problem.

889
00:53:58,035 --> 00:53:59,565
Speaker 3:  This is my antipathy towards suits.

890
00:54:00,425 --> 00:54:03,605
Speaker 7:  That's fair. I I would have that too. I just, it was fine. Yeah.

891
00:54:03,665 --> 00:54:06,885
Speaker 3:  Mr. Robot's great though, and I don't know if you can still watch the after

892
00:54:06,885 --> 00:54:09,765
Speaker 3:  show. We, we taped it in the studio right over there. Emily, Emily Oida was

893
00:54:09,785 --> 00:54:12,365
Speaker 3:  my co-host one season. It was great. Oh, that's awesome. Megan Fe when actually

894
00:54:12,365 --> 00:54:14,045
Speaker 3:  was my cohost the second season, Russell Brandon was there.

895
00:54:14,565 --> 00:54:17,285
Speaker 7:  I would leave it on while I was writing my recaps of Mr. Robot.

896
00:54:19,225 --> 00:54:19,645
Speaker 3:  Fun. But Netflix

897
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:20,605
Speaker 6:  Netflix, but

898
00:54:20,605 --> 00:54:22,805
Speaker 7:  Netflix Netflix back to Netflix. Netflix back to Netflix, back to Netflix.

899
00:54:22,805 --> 00:54:23,045
Speaker 7:  Netflix.

900
00:54:23,045 --> 00:54:26,765
Speaker 6:  Like I I I went through and Alex you wrote a really good piece about this

901
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:30,485
Speaker 6:  basically Netflix cable turn. Yeah. And especially after the WWE

902
00:54:30,485 --> 00:54:33,125
Speaker 6:  thing, but it's kind of amazing. You make the list of like, okay, what is

903
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:37,005
Speaker 6:  on cable? There's, you know, reality TV and all this sort of

904
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:40,725
Speaker 6:  like, nonsense background TV that people watch all day. Like Netflix

905
00:54:41,085 --> 00:54:44,005
Speaker 6:  actually has a ton of that. It doesn't talk a lot about it, but it has a

906
00:54:44,045 --> 00:54:47,765
Speaker 6:  ton of it. It's deep in the dating show game now. It is like, it's pretty

907
00:54:47,765 --> 00:54:51,685
Speaker 6:  good at this game. You have the, the sort of endlessly re

908
00:54:51,685 --> 00:54:55,165
Speaker 6:  watchable reruns of stuff. Netflix, that's the suits and kind of stuff you're

909
00:54:55,165 --> 00:54:57,845
Speaker 6:  talking about. And actually Netflix is unusually good at making that stuff

910
00:54:57,845 --> 00:55:01,605
Speaker 6:  popular again. You have the prestige stuff, Netflix has lots of that.

911
00:55:02,385 --> 00:55:05,365
Speaker 6:  You have movie channels. Netflix has lots of that. And then what's the last

912
00:55:05,365 --> 00:55:09,165
Speaker 6:  thing is sports. And sports is the one thing. Netflix. So for so long

913
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:13,485
Speaker 6:  was like, oh, we we're probably like live and sports don't really feel

914
00:55:13,485 --> 00:55:17,285
Speaker 6:  like they're us. And now Netflix is just fully all in on both live

915
00:55:17,345 --> 00:55:17,885
Speaker 6:  and sports.

916
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:22,165
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And specifically wrestling, which is like extremely lucrative. I

917
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:25,205
Speaker 7:  don't think it's probably, I have no idea actually if it's as lucrative as

918
00:55:25,805 --> 00:55:26,245
Speaker 7:  baseball or

919
00:55:26,245 --> 00:55:26,885
Speaker 6:  Basketball. Oh, it's

920
00:55:26,885 --> 00:55:30,565
Speaker 7:  Super lucrative. but it, it makes a ton of money and it does very, very well

921
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:34,045
Speaker 7:  in the United States. And one of the things that the, the people at WWE were

922
00:55:34,045 --> 00:55:36,525
Speaker 7:  talking about was they were really excited because now they were gonna be

923
00:55:36,525 --> 00:55:40,245
Speaker 7:  able to m like spread it internationally a lot easier instead of having to

924
00:55:40,245 --> 00:55:43,925
Speaker 7:  make all these different deals and compete with local wrestling

925
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:46,645
Speaker 7:  leagues and all of that stuff. They can just be like, nah, anybody can just

926
00:55:46,645 --> 00:55:50,605
Speaker 7:  turn on Netflix in any country and they can just watch Roman Reigns because

927
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:53,725
Speaker 7:  that's like the big wrestling guy.

928
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,445
Speaker 6:  Now. Did, did Chris Welch teach you about Roman reins this week? To be honest,

929
00:55:56,445 --> 00:55:57,005
Speaker 6:  yes. Yes. Love

930
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:57,365
Speaker 7:  That. I

931
00:55:57,365 --> 00:55:58,205
Speaker 6:  Was like, I love this for you.

932
00:55:58,445 --> 00:56:02,045
Speaker 7:  I was like, who's, who's like the rock now of, of WWE E and he's like Roman

933
00:56:02,245 --> 00:56:03,925
Speaker 7:  reigns. I was like, thank you. Wow. I actually feel

934
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:05,325
Speaker 6:  Like you would love wrestling.

935
00:56:05,885 --> 00:56:09,405
Speaker 7:  I like, I like the, the idea of wrestling and I loved Glow,

936
00:56:10,065 --> 00:56:13,925
Speaker 7:  but wrestling itself I haven't liked since I was a kid. And then once

937
00:56:14,085 --> 00:56:17,845
Speaker 7:  I worked at a company that got bodied by a professional wrestler Oh yeah,

938
00:56:17,865 --> 00:56:20,885
Speaker 7:  that's fair. That that reduced my life. That would do it my, or not my life

939
00:56:20,955 --> 00:56:24,525
Speaker 7:  that reduced my like of, of wrestling. but it's cool. I like that they slap

940
00:56:24,525 --> 00:56:26,405
Speaker 7:  each other. They like slide across their

941
00:56:26,405 --> 00:56:27,165
Speaker 3:  Ring. I like that they slap each other.

942
00:56:27,395 --> 00:56:30,165
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And then they like have big dramatic moments. I'm like, yeah, this

943
00:56:30,165 --> 00:56:32,765
Speaker 3:  Is great. Yeah, Z would like it. Like yeah, in theory, this is in

944
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:35,165
Speaker 7:  Theory, but like it's shot like garbage. It looks so ugly.

945
00:56:35,445 --> 00:56:38,485
Speaker 3:  I don't know. I don't watch it. My freshman year roommate in college had

946
00:56:38,525 --> 00:56:41,405
Speaker 3:  a both a Stacey Keebler poster and a rock poster. Oh yeah.

947
00:56:41,715 --> 00:56:45,485
Speaker 7:  Wall that was like my wall. My brother had had lots of like the

948
00:56:45,515 --> 00:56:49,205
Speaker 7:  rock and then Stone Cold Steve Austin in his room. And I was like,

949
00:56:49,845 --> 00:56:52,665
Speaker 7:  what's up with all these posters of half naked men all over your

950
00:56:52,665 --> 00:56:55,545
Speaker 3:  Walls? Yeah. It was a real distinction between the Stacey keyboard and the,

951
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:56,105
Speaker 3:  I was, that

952
00:56:56,105 --> 00:56:56,665
Speaker 7:  Was when, that was when

953
00:56:56,665 --> 00:56:58,345
Speaker 3:  Stacey I think was wearing more clothes in the poster.

954
00:56:58,445 --> 00:57:01,585
Speaker 7:  The women started appear on my Brother's Wall shortly after.

955
00:57:03,335 --> 00:57:07,105
Speaker 3:  Look, he was very happy with his fandom. Yeah. By the way, both

956
00:57:07,105 --> 00:57:10,465
Speaker 3:  Chris Welch and Casey Newton, huge wrestling fans. Huge. And I have managed

957
00:57:11,215 --> 00:57:14,665
Speaker 3:  none of it. It just doesn't look like anything to me. I love. but it is huge.

958
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:19,065
Speaker 3:  And I think from what I understand, wrestling fans have had a hard

959
00:57:19,065 --> 00:57:22,785
Speaker 3:  time of it because there was a dedicated wrestling app that got merged in

960
00:57:22,785 --> 00:57:25,825
Speaker 3:  some other streamer that has been a disaster. Yeah.

961
00:57:25,905 --> 00:57:27,985
Speaker 7:  A lot of it's been like on Peacock. Yeah. And

962
00:57:28,915 --> 00:57:29,255
Speaker 3:  You know,

963
00:57:29,365 --> 00:57:30,015
Speaker 7:  It's peacock

964
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:34,015
Speaker 3:  And I think they're very happy that Netflix might try that. That's the read

965
00:57:34,055 --> 00:57:37,015
Speaker 3:  I get. What if Netflix does a good job is like people are excited about it

966
00:57:37,015 --> 00:57:37,215
Speaker 3:  and

967
00:57:37,215 --> 00:57:40,015
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And it sounds like Netflix is very interested in like doing a lot of

968
00:57:40,015 --> 00:57:43,775
Speaker 7:  the, the extra programming around it, the after shows and the, let's do a

969
00:57:43,775 --> 00:57:47,615
Speaker 7:  whole, let's explain to Alex and NELI and everybody else who Roman Reigns

970
00:57:47,615 --> 00:57:50,935
Speaker 7:  is kind of documentaries and maybe I'll watch one 'cause Who knows

971
00:57:50,965 --> 00:57:52,735
Speaker 3:  Take suits off your service. I'll watch anything Netflix.

972
00:57:54,435 --> 00:57:55,655
Speaker 3:  I'm just saying do it for America.

973
00:57:56,485 --> 00:57:57,815
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think Netflix

974
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:03,025
Speaker 6:  is going to end up looking really smart here. It's like

975
00:58:03,565 --> 00:58:07,265
Speaker 6:  the, there's been rumors forever that every time TV rights come up, Netflix

976
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:10,225
Speaker 6:  is supposedly gonna bid this. There was a big story about it for Formula

977
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:13,545
Speaker 6:  One because Drive Is Survive is so successful. They're like, oh, maybe they'll

978
00:58:13,545 --> 00:58:16,025
Speaker 6:  just buy the rights. But then they did the weird thing where it was just

979
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:19,185
Speaker 6:  like that golf tournament with a bunch of golfers and a bunch of F1 stars

980
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:23,145
Speaker 6:  and that was their big first foray into live sports.

981
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:27,945
Speaker 6:  It wasn't good, but I guess it did. Well I don know, but this is

982
00:58:27,945 --> 00:58:31,785
Speaker 6:  like, what was it, a $5 billion, like 10 year long deal

983
00:58:31,785 --> 00:58:33,145
Speaker 6:  or something like, this is serious.

984
00:58:33,615 --> 00:58:37,505
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it's, it's $5 billion. It's 10 years. After five years they

985
00:58:37,505 --> 00:58:40,385
Speaker 7:  have the right to be like, nevermind. Interesting. And they get everything

986
00:58:40,385 --> 00:58:43,865
Speaker 7:  just fully packaged and sent to them. They're like, like W

987
00:58:44,245 --> 00:58:47,985
Speaker 7:  WWE has done kind of everything. It's very turnkey for Netflix, similar to

988
00:58:47,985 --> 00:58:51,545
Speaker 7:  a lot of their secondary licensing stuff. So it's like, on the one hand

989
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:55,545
Speaker 7:  I love original programming. I love thoughtful new

990
00:58:55,825 --> 00:58:58,545
Speaker 7:  original programming. On the other hand, we've talked a lot about how that

991
00:58:58,545 --> 00:59:02,425
Speaker 7:  was just gonna stop when advertising became more popular. So it makes

992
00:59:02,425 --> 00:59:05,625
Speaker 7:  sense that Netflix kind of becomes USA network or

993
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:10,305
Speaker 7:  t and t Yeah. Whatever network you were really fond of. Spike TV was the

994
00:59:10,545 --> 00:59:14,185
Speaker 7:  one I keep thinking about. Oh boy. And, and that's just

995
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:18,065
Speaker 7:  what it's gonna be now. And it, it's like a good value

996
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:21,565
Speaker 7:  proposition for most people. You spend 6 99 a month

997
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:25,805
Speaker 7:  and you get cable. Yeah. Effectively on demand. I see

998
00:59:25,805 --> 00:59:29,045
Speaker 6:  It slightly differently. And to me it feels like the, the risk for Netflix

999
00:59:29,985 --> 00:59:33,815
Speaker 6:  as far as I can tell, is just that it's gonna get out

1000
00:59:33,815 --> 00:59:37,495
Speaker 6:  over its skis trying to do everything all at once.

1001
00:59:38,115 --> 00:59:42,015
Speaker 6:  And like it's, it's deep into gaming now. It's doing live sports.

1002
00:59:42,015 --> 00:59:42,135
Speaker 6:  I

1003
00:59:42,135 --> 00:59:42,295
Speaker 3:  Hate that

1004
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:45,815
Speaker 6:  By the way. It's, it's doing all of these dating shows like

1005
00:59:46,645 --> 00:59:49,895
Speaker 6:  Netflix for a while felt

1006
00:59:50,445 --> 00:59:54,295
Speaker 6:  sort of understandable and focused in a way that I think worked for it. And

1007
00:59:54,295 --> 00:59:57,975
Speaker 6:  it was, it was doing a streaming service

1008
00:59:58,355 --> 01:00:01,375
Speaker 6:  and only a streaming service in a time when lots of other companies were

1009
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:03,895
Speaker 6:  trying to do a streaming service and lots of other things. And it actually

1010
01:00:03,895 --> 01:00:07,615
Speaker 6:  helped Netflix and hurt those companies. And now Netflix is trying

1011
01:00:07,675 --> 01:00:10,815
Speaker 6:  to sort of do too many things. It feels like,

1012
01:00:11,095 --> 01:00:14,215
Speaker 7:  I think that's the strategy for Netflix though, because think about it. If

1013
01:00:14,215 --> 01:00:18,175
Speaker 7:  you are right now, I believe the second largest streaming service

1014
01:00:18,385 --> 01:00:21,895
Speaker 7:  after Amazon Prime, which kind of has big asterisk next to

1015
01:00:21,895 --> 01:00:23,575
Speaker 6:  It's Yeah, it's the largest streaming service. Yeah.

1016
01:00:23,645 --> 01:00:26,695
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So, so Netflix is effectively the largest and they're just under the

1017
01:00:26,695 --> 01:00:28,975
Speaker 7:  impression, they're like, yeah, you'll probably, you might go get Max, you

1018
01:00:28,975 --> 01:00:32,095
Speaker 7:  might go get Disney, you might go get Paramount, LOL, you might get Peacock,

1019
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,855
Speaker 7:  whatever, but you're gonna get Netflix. And so we're going to like,

1020
01:00:36,235 --> 01:00:39,975
Speaker 7:  you're gonna spend at least $6 and 99 cents a month with us. So just

1021
01:00:40,245 --> 01:00:42,495
Speaker 7:  look, look at all the crap we can give you. Yeah, we can give you a bunch

1022
01:00:42,495 --> 01:00:42,775
Speaker 7:  of stuff.

1023
01:00:42,775 --> 01:00:44,775
Speaker 3:  They're the Microsoft word of streaming services.

1024
01:00:44,885 --> 01:00:48,175
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And, and So I, that's why I said they're like the t and t, they're,

1025
01:00:48,175 --> 01:00:51,295
Speaker 7:  they're just the basic cable. It's just all of basic cable now in one place.

1026
01:00:51,955 --> 01:00:55,815
Speaker 7:  And the, the app is terrible. So you're constantly, anytime you open

1027
01:00:55,815 --> 01:00:58,415
Speaker 7:  it on your iPad, you just get a bunch of games and you don't wanna play those

1028
01:00:58,475 --> 01:01:02,295
Speaker 7:  on your iPad on a like fucking Netflix app. But you're gonna, because

1029
01:01:02,295 --> 01:01:05,935
Speaker 7:  they keep pushing that on you. And that's really annoying. But that, that

1030
01:01:05,935 --> 01:01:09,815
Speaker 7:  rant goes into, I think Netflix next turn is they need to figure out their

1031
01:01:09,815 --> 01:01:13,015
Speaker 7:  recommendation engine. It's really bad right now. They need to figure out

1032
01:01:13,015 --> 01:01:16,375
Speaker 7:  their, their user interface. It's not great right now. They've got a lot

1033
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:19,855
Speaker 7:  of work to do to compete in that space because eventually if

1034
01:01:20,235 --> 01:01:24,015
Speaker 7:  all it does is repeatedly recommend Suits to NELI, he is

1035
01:01:24,015 --> 01:01:26,295
Speaker 7:  gonna unsubscribe and for good reason.

1036
01:01:26,395 --> 01:01:29,935
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna do it right now. Yeah. You show me Suits one more time.

1037
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:35,215
Speaker 3:  My Microsoft, this is Yeah. Your, this is why I mentioned Microsoft Word.

1038
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:39,975
Speaker 3:  I know people at Microsoft would love to take stuff outta the toolbar.

1039
01:01:40,205 --> 01:01:44,055
Speaker 3:  They can't because Microsoft Word is not focused. It's not one thing.

1040
01:01:44,475 --> 01:01:47,215
Speaker 3:  It is, it's everything. A million things to a million different people. And

1041
01:01:47,215 --> 01:01:51,175
Speaker 3:  it now, it just has to be a million things. So if Netflix wants to be

1042
01:01:51,465 --> 01:01:54,935
Speaker 3:  suits and live TV and wrestling and

1043
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:58,935
Speaker 3:  F1 docuseries and games, like that's a lot of things.

1044
01:01:59,755 --> 01:02:02,255
Speaker 3:  And like it just has to be all the things to all the people all the time.

1045
01:02:02,475 --> 01:02:06,455
Speaker 3:  Yep. I do think that like it's, I agree that

1046
01:02:06,455 --> 01:02:09,055
Speaker 3:  it, it's becoming, it's becoming more and more of what looks like a cable

1047
01:02:09,055 --> 01:02:12,695
Speaker 3:  bundle. The part where like they're doing the worst of cable

1048
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:16,655
Speaker 3:  pricing per screen. That's why people started to hate the cable companies.

1049
01:02:16,755 --> 01:02:20,445
Speaker 3:  Yep. Fully why people started to hate the cable companies and like that's

1050
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:20,885
Speaker 3:  the danger.

1051
01:02:21,665 --> 01:02:24,965
Speaker 7:  And, and they're just really hoping 'cause that, that per screen is only

1052
01:02:24,985 --> 01:02:28,565
Speaker 7:  for the ad free version. So, so under that it's, it's two,

1053
01:02:28,585 --> 01:02:32,125
Speaker 7:  that's it. And you, you get two screens and if somebody else in your family

1054
01:02:32,465 --> 01:02:35,005
Speaker 7:  is like, oh, I also wanna watch 'cause you have a big family, then you better

1055
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:38,645
Speaker 7:  go get another subscription. And and that's the, the ad version,

1056
01:02:38,785 --> 01:02:42,565
Speaker 7:  the ad free version is the 7 99 a month. So, I can see them being like,

1057
01:02:42,995 --> 01:02:46,645
Speaker 7:  well You don't wanna deal with that. It's a dollar cheaper and you just have

1058
01:02:46,645 --> 01:02:50,525
Speaker 7:  to sit through some ads. And I personally will hate that because I cut

1059
01:02:50,525 --> 01:02:53,665
Speaker 7:  the cable in like 2007.

1060
01:02:54,065 --> 01:02:57,825
Speaker 3:  I can't get rid of one streaming service. I keep suggesting like, let's get

1061
01:02:57,825 --> 01:03:00,945
Speaker 3:  rid of this one. Then Becky's like, some comedy special I wanna watch is

1062
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:02,665
Speaker 3:  on that one next month. And it's like, oh, that's

1063
01:03:02,935 --> 01:03:05,465
Speaker 7:  Criterion is so good. You can't get rid of Criterion.

1064
01:03:05,665 --> 01:03:09,105
Speaker 6:  Okay. Wait, that is actually a perfect segue into the other streaming news

1065
01:03:09,105 --> 01:03:11,985
Speaker 6:  this week that I thought was interesting, which is that Verizon made another

1066
01:03:11,985 --> 01:03:15,545
Speaker 6:  one of, its like we're bundling a bunch of streaming services together, announcements.

1067
01:03:15,845 --> 01:03:18,665
Speaker 6:  And then there was a story in the information where a bunch of Verizon people

1068
01:03:18,665 --> 01:03:22,625
Speaker 6:  were talking about like, we think that the value add here

1069
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:26,705
Speaker 6:  is to be the management tool on top of all of your streaming services.

1070
01:03:26,925 --> 01:03:30,785
Speaker 6:  And it's like, well that's cable and that sucks. Like, you know, what I

1071
01:03:30,785 --> 01:03:34,625
Speaker 6:  want is like a harder company to get ahold of to deal with all of my stuff.

1072
01:03:34,845 --> 01:03:38,545
Speaker 6:  But I think the, the next turn for all of this with these companies

1073
01:03:38,925 --> 01:03:42,705
Speaker 6:  is like the rest of the ecosystem around this. Like,

1074
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:45,945
Speaker 6:  we're gonna start to get more and more apps that are like, we're just gonna

1075
01:03:45,945 --> 01:03:48,265
Speaker 6:  make it easier for you to search stuff and we're gonna get all these companies,

1076
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:51,265
Speaker 6:  Verizon's doing it, Amazon's doing it, Apple's doing it that are like, just

1077
01:03:51,265 --> 01:03:55,025
Speaker 6:  use us to subscribe to these streaming services. And I

1078
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:59,025
Speaker 6:  actually think a, a real value to provide is

1079
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:03,305
Speaker 6:  like we will just give you the button you can tap to turn

1080
01:04:03,305 --> 01:04:06,905
Speaker 6:  on your subscription or turn it off to a thing. And I think there's gonna

1081
01:04:06,905 --> 01:04:09,585
Speaker 6:  be real competition around that. Like, I just signed up for Paramount Plus

1082
01:04:09,885 --> 01:04:13,625
Speaker 6:  so that I can watch three weeks of football and God

1083
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:16,625
Speaker 6:  help me if I get to that fourth week and accidentally pay for another month

1084
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:20,585
Speaker 6:  of Paramount Plus. And there's gonna be a crazy competition to give me

1085
01:04:20,585 --> 01:04:23,065
Speaker 6:  a button that I can press to turn off Paramount. Plus

1086
01:04:23,505 --> 01:04:25,305
Speaker 7:  I could have just shared my login with you.

1087
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:28,665
Speaker 6:  I don't want your login. Be careful. It's don don't. It's gonna be like,

1088
01:04:28,685 --> 01:04:29,505
Speaker 6:  oh, do you wanna watch

1089
01:04:29,505 --> 01:04:32,265
Speaker 3:  Star Rek? don Don, if you do that, don't. Then Kevin, Kevin Costner comes

1090
01:04:32,265 --> 01:04:33,425
Speaker 3:  to your house and shoots you,

1091
01:04:36,535 --> 01:04:37,745
Speaker 7:  Puts his hat back on, walks the

1092
01:04:37,745 --> 01:04:40,985
Speaker 3:  Door. That's why people have Paramount Plus. Yeah. S Watch Yellowstone. Oh

1093
01:04:40,985 --> 01:04:43,385
Speaker 3:  yeah. The show where there's dad

1094
01:04:44,205 --> 01:04:45,465
Speaker 7:  Who murders people of

1095
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,545
Speaker 3:  Murder. Murdery dad. There's the good son who died.

1096
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,385
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Who murdered people.

1097
01:04:50,565 --> 01:04:54,025
Speaker 3:  He was also kind of murdery drunk daughter Murdery. Yeah. And then Call of

1098
01:04:54,025 --> 01:04:54,625
Speaker 3:  Duty son

1099
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:58,545
Speaker 7:  And there's a, there's another son 'cause who's only like a half son.

1100
01:04:58,885 --> 01:04:59,865
Speaker 7:  All murdery though. Yes.

1101
01:05:00,045 --> 01:05:02,825
Speaker 3:  No, but the Call of Duty son is like the funniest part of that whole show.

1102
01:05:02,825 --> 01:05:03,625
Speaker 3:  They're like, what if one

1103
01:05:05,475 --> 01:05:08,665
Speaker 3:  guy's, I'm not saying I didn't like it, I'm just saying like every couple

1104
01:05:08,665 --> 01:05:10,985
Speaker 3:  episodes are like, do some Call of Duty shit. And he's like, all right dad.

1105
01:05:10,985 --> 01:05:11,385
Speaker 3:  And he like,

1106
01:05:11,965 --> 01:05:15,345
Speaker 7:  He like puts on, he puts on like all his old Army gear and is like, let's,

1107
01:05:15,395 --> 01:05:16,225
Speaker 7:  let's mess him up.

1108
01:05:16,655 --> 01:05:20,205
Speaker 3:  It's like, see you later. I guess that just, just Call of Duty stuff

1109
01:05:20,675 --> 01:05:21,165
Speaker 14:  Montana.

1110
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:25,365
Speaker 3:  That's good. I look, I I wish you well.

1111
01:05:25,935 --> 01:05:29,485
Speaker 3:  Don't fuck with the Duttons. We gotta take a break. We'll be right back.

1112
01:07:40,305 --> 01:07:44,095
Speaker 3:  Alright, we're back five hour Vergecast. It's

1113
01:07:44,095 --> 01:07:47,695
Speaker 3:  happening. We're we're gonna do quick lightning round. Okay. I will say

1114
01:07:48,985 --> 01:07:52,775
Speaker 3:  we've had some listeners offer to personally sponsor the

1115
01:07:52,775 --> 01:07:56,135
Speaker 3:  lightning round, which is money that we will figure out how to accept

1116
01:07:57,995 --> 01:08:01,455
Speaker 3:  in the absence of these ignorant brands who won't pay us millions of dollars

1117
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:05,095
Speaker 3:  to have the lightning round sponsored by the refrigerator companies. Individual

1118
01:08:05,095 --> 01:08:08,735
Speaker 3:  virtue listeners have offered us upwards of

1119
01:08:08,735 --> 01:08:12,375
Speaker 3:  $45 and we're gonna, we will find a way to take that money.

1120
01:08:12,685 --> 01:08:16,495
Speaker 3:  However, this week is the 40th anniversary of the

1121
01:08:16,495 --> 01:08:20,015

1133

Speaker 7:  I love you

1135
01:08:57,225 --> 01:09:00,025

1136
01:09:00,025 --> 01:09:03,065
Speaker 3:  Mac, by the way, did turn 40 David, you had Walt on the, on the Wednesday

1137
01:09:03,065 --> 01:09:03,265
Speaker 3:  show.

1138
01:09:03,415 --> 01:09:07,145
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Walt Mossberg, who has, I would say more stories about

1139
01:09:07,725 --> 01:09:11,545
Speaker 6:  the history of Apple and the Macintosh than any single

1140
01:09:11,595 --> 01:09:14,665
Speaker 6:  other person on planet Earth just came on and told us some stories about

1141
01:09:14,665 --> 01:09:17,385
Speaker 6:  the Mac. It was super fun. It was. He's a good hang. He has been on The Vergecast

1142
01:09:17,385 --> 01:09:20,705
Speaker 6:  in a long time. Yes. And he told me he's personally very upset with you about

1143
01:09:20,705 --> 01:09:24,385
Speaker 6:  it. We cut that out. But he said a lot of really mean things about you.

1144
01:09:25,165 --> 01:09:26,345
Speaker 6:  So we're gonna have to have him back soon.

1145
01:09:27,465 --> 01:09:30,465
Speaker 3:  I will. I listened to it. I was on a plane. I listened to it when I landed.

1146
01:09:30,725 --> 01:09:33,585
Speaker 3:  And David, I'm very disappointed in you that you did not know what the Apple

1147
01:09:33,585 --> 01:09:36,945
Speaker 3:  two Gs was. I owned an Apple two Gs. It was a very weird computer

1148
01:09:37,865 --> 01:09:40,345
Speaker 3:  and it was, Walt mentioned that he'd owned one and you're like, I've never

1149
01:09:40,345 --> 01:09:42,065
Speaker 3:  heard of it. And I was like screaming at my

1150
01:09:42,065 --> 01:09:44,425
Speaker 6:  Phone. I literally Googled it. 'cause I was like, is he saying the name wrong?

1151
01:09:44,425 --> 01:09:47,145
Speaker 6:  Like I thought I pretty much knew most and no, he was right. I was wrong.

1152
01:09:47,215 --> 01:09:47,505
Speaker 6:  I've

1153
01:09:47,505 --> 01:09:51,265
Speaker 3:  Never felt what it's like to be The Vergecast listener more than I was in

1154
01:09:51,265 --> 01:09:55,185
Speaker 3:  the waiting for an Uber just like screaming at my phone. You don't know what

1155
01:09:55,185 --> 01:09:58,585
Speaker 3:  that is. Yeah. And that I won't, I refuse to learn.

1156
01:10:00,715 --> 01:10:02,265
Speaker 3:  Sorry. That's right.

1157
01:10:02,805 --> 01:10:03,545
Speaker 6:  That's how I feel.

1158
01:10:03,965 --> 01:10:04,865
Speaker 3:  All right. That

1159
01:10:06,675 --> 01:10:07,705
Speaker 3:  Cranz, what's your lightning round?

1160
01:10:08,145 --> 01:10:11,945
Speaker 7:  I got two actually. So I. I'll, I'll go serious first. Okay.

1161
01:10:13,295 --> 01:10:16,415
Speaker 7:  There's a baby that's covered in technology.

1162
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:17,215
Speaker 3:  This

1163
01:10:17,215 --> 01:10:18,095
Speaker 6:  Is the serious one

1164
01:10:18,435 --> 01:10:19,295
Speaker 3:  Is the baby. Okay.

1165
01:10:20,605 --> 01:10:21,975
Speaker 7:  It's not a real baby. Okay.

1166
01:10:21,975 --> 01:10:23,495
Speaker 3:  Good. Important note. There's,

1167
01:10:23,605 --> 01:10:27,175
Speaker 7:  There's a a, they're, they're doing fashion in, in France

1168
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:31,295
Speaker 7:  and Scap, the fashion house was showing off their, all their new looks.

1169
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:35,295
Speaker 7:  And a woman comes out and she's wearing this gorgeous gown covered in

1170
01:10:35,295 --> 01:10:37,295
Speaker 7:  like Intel fans from like

1171
01:10:37,435 --> 01:10:39,495
Speaker 3:  2000. Yes. Look at this dress. Is

1172
01:10:39,495 --> 01:10:43,175
Speaker 7:  It, it's sick. It looks so cool. And then someone else

1173
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:46,895
Speaker 7:  came out in an outfit called The Mother, which

1174
01:10:47,135 --> 01:10:50,895
Speaker 7:  appeared to be primarily like a, a white top and like a white white

1175
01:10:50,895 --> 01:10:54,615
Speaker 7:  bottom. And then they were holding a baby made out of

1176
01:10:55,235 --> 01:10:59,175
Speaker 7:  old technology. Yeah. And it was just, it's a beautiful baby. You

1177
01:10:59,175 --> 01:11:02,775
Speaker 7:  gotta, when when you're not driving, take a moment. Go look at the baby.

1178
01:11:03,655 --> 01:11:04,655
Speaker 7:  I I love it.

1179
01:11:05,005 --> 01:11:08,975
Speaker 6:  This is a pull over your car and Google this thing like whatever you're thinking

1180
01:11:09,275 --> 01:11:12,775
Speaker 6:  in your mind right now. The reality is 50 times wilder

1181
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:14,165
Speaker 6:  than that.

1182
01:11:14,315 --> 01:11:17,805
Speaker 3:  Both of these models are making catwalk face. Yeah. You know,

1183
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,165
Speaker 7:  But holding the tech

1184
01:11:19,165 --> 01:11:22,405
Speaker 3:  Baby. But in the context of these outfits and that baby

1185
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:26,805
Speaker 3:  totally recontextualize catwalk face, like Yeah. Just a what is going

1186
01:11:26,825 --> 01:11:28,845
Speaker 3:  on here? What

1187
01:11:29,155 --> 01:11:31,245
Speaker 7:  Sometimes you just got a baby made a tech.

1188
01:11:31,585 --> 01:11:34,805
Speaker 6:  If you were listening to this and you could acquire one of these outfits

1189
01:11:34,825 --> 01:11:38,565
Speaker 6:  and bring it to us, one of us will wear it on The Vergecast. I promise

1190
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:42,645
Speaker 3:  Rosemary said the toddler was a reference to the alien movies.

1191
01:11:43,765 --> 01:11:47,485
Speaker 7:  Rosemary is the creative director for Capparelli. Yeah. So Daniel

1192
01:11:47,485 --> 01:11:51,445
Speaker 7:  Rosemary, he also said that now that the technology I grew up with is

1193
01:11:51,455 --> 01:11:55,205
Speaker 7:  antiquated, that so it's so antiquated that it's almost

1194
01:11:55,205 --> 01:11:59,165
Speaker 7:  difficult to source a certain vi as certain vintage fabrics and embellishment.

1195
01:11:59,165 --> 01:12:01,925
Speaker 7:  So that's why he did it. 'cause he was basically like, it's really hard to

1196
01:12:01,925 --> 01:12:05,325
Speaker 7:  find old fans for Intel processors and, and buddy

1197
01:12:05,785 --> 01:12:08,485
Speaker 7:  you just, you just get, get a new set of friends.

1198
01:12:09,395 --> 01:12:12,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I got a closet full of laptops that would say otherwise.

1199
01:12:12,435 --> 01:12:16,205
Speaker 7:  Like we, we got you The Verge listeners. Got you. Like you need sourcing

1200
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:20,165
Speaker 7:  for this stuff. You can pay us instead of whoever you paid for all of this

1201
01:12:20,165 --> 01:12:22,045
Speaker 6:  Technology. Have you seen our gadget closet come

1202
01:12:22,045 --> 01:12:24,685
Speaker 3:  20 years? Dress made entirely of USBA cables.

1203
01:12:25,825 --> 01:12:29,445
Speaker 3:  We got you. Calm. Now you want to talk about measuring success. All right,

1204
01:12:29,455 --> 01:12:30,885
Speaker 3:  David, I love that. What's yours?

1205
01:12:31,755 --> 01:12:35,685
Speaker 6:  Mine is that The Pixel nine leaks are already starting to come. So

1206
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:39,525
Speaker 6:  presumably we're gonna get a glimpse of The Pixel nine in May or June

1207
01:12:39,805 --> 01:12:42,965
Speaker 6:  whenever Google io is, and then the real thing in the fall.

1208
01:12:43,865 --> 01:12:47,765
Speaker 6:  But the leaks are already starting to come out because Google is just

1209
01:12:47,765 --> 01:12:50,765
Speaker 6:  completely incapable of hiding a product. It appears

1210
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:55,085
Speaker 6:  and it looks kind of nice, like it looks the, we will put the links in the

1211
01:12:55,085 --> 01:12:58,005
Speaker 6:  show notes, but they, they redid the camera bar on the back so that it's

1212
01:12:58,005 --> 01:13:00,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it does look nice being like a visor. It just looks like a camera bar

1213
01:13:00,725 --> 01:13:01,165
Speaker 6:  on the back.

1214
01:13:02,675 --> 01:13:02,965
Speaker 6:  It's

1215
01:13:03,025 --> 01:13:06,845
Speaker 7:  Got, it's given some iPhone edges to it. Yeah. Or at least I thought like

1216
01:13:07,275 --> 01:13:11,045
Speaker 6:  It's, it's got the sort of rounded rectangle thing going on for it. It looks

1217
01:13:11,045 --> 01:13:14,125
Speaker 6:  nice. And mostly I just wanted to bring it up because I said I think it was

1218
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:18,045
Speaker 6:  last week that after the Samsung announcement, I am, I'm bearish on

1219
01:13:18,045 --> 01:13:21,605
Speaker 6:  the future of The Pixel. And so a million people sent me this and we're like,

1220
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:25,565
Speaker 6:  what about this new pixels coming? And to all of you, I wanna

1221
01:13:25,585 --> 01:13:29,045
Speaker 6:  say this looks great and I sincerely hope it's the greatest phone in the

1222
01:13:29,045 --> 01:13:32,485
Speaker 6:  history of the universe. I also think it's possible that no one at Google

1223
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:33,765
Speaker 6:  knows it's being released.

1224
01:13:34,405 --> 01:13:37,045
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Which is why it's leaking out. Yeah. There's like one person on The

1225
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:39,165
Speaker 3:  Pixel team who's like, let show it to people.

1226
01:13:39,835 --> 01:13:42,525
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's just like, do I, what is this phone on my desk? It seems neat.

1227
01:13:42,705 --> 01:13:44,405
Speaker 6:  Should I, should I show somebody?

1228
01:13:46,075 --> 01:13:46,565
Speaker 3:  Very good.

1229
01:13:47,545 --> 01:13:48,205
Speaker 7:  What's yours?

1230
01:13:48,315 --> 01:13:50,125
Speaker 3:  Well, I got two. Okay. But you had two.

1231
01:13:50,445 --> 01:13:51,165
Speaker 7:  I I do have two.

1232
01:13:51,265 --> 01:13:54,645
Speaker 3:  So I'll, I'll go then you and Sounds good. And then, right. That's how we're,

1233
01:13:54,645 --> 01:13:55,605
Speaker 3:  that's how we're gonna do it. And

1234
01:13:55,605 --> 01:13:56,925
Speaker 6:  I'll just be here. Yeah.

1235
01:13:57,865 --> 01:14:00,525
Speaker 3:  You, well you started, we, you had Walt

1236
01:14:02,075 --> 01:14:04,925
Speaker 3:  your lightning round was I did another verb Chest that was better than this

1237
01:14:04,925 --> 01:14:05,125
Speaker 3:  one.

1238
01:14:08,155 --> 01:14:10,405
Speaker 3:  Okay. So Apple is all in on spatial audio

1239
01:14:11,965 --> 01:14:14,645
Speaker 3:  probably 'cause of The, Vision, Pro because it's all around you. Yeah. So

1240
01:14:14,645 --> 01:14:16,485
Speaker 3:  they're gonna start to pay artists

1241
01:14:18,675 --> 01:14:22,415
Speaker 3:  10% more for the spatial audio streams. Gimme page. So

1242
01:14:22,415 --> 01:14:26,335
Speaker 3:  pennies, pennies per stream. More if they people stream the spatial

1243
01:14:26,335 --> 01:14:29,855
Speaker 3:  one, which is designed to incentivize artists to both make the spatial mixes

1244
01:14:30,075 --> 01:14:33,575
Speaker 3:  and then promote them on Apples service as spatial mixes.

1245
01:14:34,805 --> 01:14:38,045
Speaker 3:  I hate this. I hate this so much.

1246
01:14:39,185 --> 01:14:41,525
Speaker 3:  One because I think, I think the math doesn't actually kind of work out.

1247
01:14:42,265 --> 01:14:45,925
Speaker 3:  So I was looking on on like random artists, sort of like job

1248
01:14:45,925 --> 01:14:49,805
Speaker 3:  boards, a spatial mix. People are buying 'em for 500

1249
01:14:49,805 --> 01:14:53,005
Speaker 3:  bucks. Like you're like, fire off your files to some poor engineer who's

1250
01:14:53,005 --> 01:14:56,165
Speaker 3:  like never heard your music before. They'll just generate a spatial mix.

1251
01:14:56,475 --> 01:14:59,965
Speaker 3:  Most of that sounds bad. Yeah. And I know that people are always arguing

1252
01:14:59,965 --> 01:15:02,845
Speaker 3:  with me. They think some of them sound good. I I know some of them sound

1253
01:15:02,845 --> 01:15:06,805
Speaker 3:  good. I'm a man who owned a super audio CD player. They could play the Beatles

1254
01:15:06,825 --> 01:15:10,805
Speaker 3:  and Quadraphonic sound. All right. I I understand.

1255
01:15:11,145 --> 01:15:15,005
Speaker 3:  Is that also how you met your wife? Is that No, that's what's,

1256
01:15:15,065 --> 01:15:18,365
Speaker 3:  that's what's driving us apart day by day.

1257
01:15:20,745 --> 01:15:24,725
Speaker 3:  I'm just telling you. I I believe you. I've been playing with surround audio

1258
01:15:24,935 --> 01:15:28,565
Speaker 3:  since the beginning. Yeah. If you do a good job

1259
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:32,765
Speaker 3:  having more channels or more objects or however Atmos wants to work,

1260
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:36,845
Speaker 3:  whatever, having more is better. Great.

1261
01:15:37,745 --> 01:15:41,405
Speaker 3:  If you do it like crap, it sounds worse. Which is why people are al like

1262
01:15:41,545 --> 01:15:45,365
Speaker 3:  always get reverted to stereo. Like it's the easiest thing.

1263
01:15:45,365 --> 01:15:48,805
Speaker 3:  It's the most addressable thing if there's more stereo

1264
01:15:49,075 --> 01:15:52,925
Speaker 3:  devices on the market than anything. And especially when you're like

1265
01:15:52,995 --> 01:15:56,845
Speaker 3:  farting out if 500 pop, like they're, it's not gonna sound

1266
01:15:56,845 --> 01:16:00,765
Speaker 3:  good. And most spatial mixes are that level. And

1267
01:16:00,935 --> 01:16:04,525
Speaker 3:  Apple incentivizing it because they want their headset to go off is just

1268
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:08,565
Speaker 3:  the ugh, ugh. It's bad. I'm just telling

1269
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:12,205
Speaker 3:  you it's bad. It's gonna make more things sound bad than sound good. Which

1270
01:16:12,205 --> 01:16:15,565
Speaker 7:  Is worse. That, or when DVDs were really into pan and scan,

1271
01:16:16,985 --> 01:16:20,085
Speaker 3:  That's kind of where we're at. Yeah. The that's a good, the good comparison,

1272
01:16:20,615 --> 01:16:24,485
Speaker 3:  right? That's like, what if we just shove this into that

1273
01:16:24,505 --> 01:16:25,245
Speaker 3:  box and you're like,

1274
01:16:25,245 --> 01:16:26,845
Speaker 7:  No, that's gross. Stop it. Yeah.

1275
01:16:27,515 --> 01:16:30,645
Speaker 3:  Look, there are some, I know there are some good ones, but even on Apple's

1276
01:16:30,925 --> 01:16:34,845
Speaker 3:  playlists there, there are really bad spatial mixes. And

1277
01:16:34,845 --> 01:16:37,565
Speaker 3:  it's because there just isn't the volume of people who care enough there.

1278
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:41,605
Speaker 3:  It's not the volume of artists who are like, I'm going to sit down and

1279
01:16:41,605 --> 01:16:45,365
Speaker 3:  make a spatial audio record. They're more like, I'm on tour forever

1280
01:16:45,365 --> 01:16:49,165
Speaker 3:  because that's where the money is. I'm gonna buy some loops and do a rap

1281
01:16:49,165 --> 01:16:52,885
Speaker 3:  in my hotel room and hope that's a hit. Like, that's the reality of most

1282
01:16:52,885 --> 01:16:55,485
Speaker 3:  artists right now. And I'm not saying that's good or bad. Like that's just

1283
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:59,285
Speaker 3:  where the music industry has forced most musicians

1284
01:16:59,555 --> 01:17:03,045
Speaker 3:  into money. Right? They make their money with sinks. They make their money

1285
01:17:03,235 --> 01:17:06,485
Speaker 3:  like ads and movie sync. They make their money

1286
01:17:07,745 --> 01:17:11,525
Speaker 3:  on selling their old catalogs to billionaires who then do more weird

1287
01:17:11,525 --> 01:17:15,445
Speaker 3:  stuff with them. They make their money on tour. They do not

1288
01:17:15,445 --> 01:17:19,325
Speaker 3:  make their money selling records. And so if you are like now to make

1289
01:17:19,365 --> 01:17:23,125
Speaker 3:  a, make your record more complicated, then we'll pay you more money.

1290
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:24,005
Speaker 3:  Like that's ugh,

1291
01:17:24,105 --> 01:17:25,045
Speaker 7:  No one's gonna do that. Yeah.

1292
01:17:25,345 --> 01:17:28,285
Speaker 3:  It doesn't seem like they're doing an app. Maybe I'm gonna be wrong. I just

1293
01:17:28,285 --> 01:17:31,725
Speaker 3:  like, look at this. I'm like, ah, we are, we are we gonna make music sound

1294
01:17:31,725 --> 01:17:32,965
Speaker 3:  shitty? So a headset sells more.

1295
01:17:34,425 --> 01:17:36,105
Speaker 7:  I mean it's MP three is all over again.

1296
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:40,425
Speaker 3:  It's weird man. It's weird. Alright, I know someone's gonna send me some

1297
01:17:40,425 --> 01:17:44,265
Speaker 3:  facial mix. Like George Harrison's creeping up behind you. Yeah, I I've been

1298
01:17:44,265 --> 01:17:46,785
Speaker 3:  there. All right. What's your other one?

1299
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:48,665
Speaker 7:  Have y'all heard of Powell World?

1300
01:17:49,055 --> 01:17:50,545
Speaker 3:  Just Pokemon with guns? Yeah,

1301
01:17:50,545 --> 01:17:53,945
Speaker 7:  It's Pokemon with guns. Yeah. That's, that's all it is. It's Pokemon with

1302
01:17:53,945 --> 01:17:54,185
Speaker 7:  guns.

1303
01:17:55,025 --> 01:17:58,825
Speaker 6:  I just love that. Those are exactly the words in exactly the order. I was

1304
01:17:58,825 --> 01:18:02,425
Speaker 6:  gonna say, this is just the unofficial tagline of Powell World now. I

1305
01:18:02,425 --> 01:18:02,745
Speaker 3:  Love it.

1306
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:07,665
Speaker 7:  It is, it is so Pokemon with guns that there was a YouTube creator named

1307
01:18:07,895 --> 01:18:11,745
Speaker 7:  Toasted shoes who was like, look at this. IIII made it Pokemon with

1308
01:18:11,745 --> 01:18:15,665
Speaker 7:  guns. I I put in Pikachu and all and everybody, I, I moed all the

1309
01:18:15,665 --> 01:18:19,385
Speaker 7:  little creatures that you can capture and made them Pokemon and you can play

1310
01:18:19,385 --> 01:18:23,025
Speaker 7:  his ash. And guess what got shut down real

1311
01:18:23,145 --> 01:18:26,625
Speaker 7:  fast by Nintendo our, our boy toasted shoes.

1312
01:18:27,185 --> 01:18:30,825
Speaker 7:  It, it's unclear how he was modding it. 'cause it doesn't yet allow mods

1313
01:18:30,945 --> 01:18:34,865
Speaker 7:  'cause it's still in like alpha release. Yeah. It is blowing up the charts

1314
01:18:34,965 --> 01:18:38,905
Speaker 7:  on, on Steam and, and people are loving to try it out. There's a lot of

1315
01:18:38,905 --> 01:18:42,745
Speaker 7:  weirdness around it. but it is essentially what if you had Pokemon and what

1316
01:18:42,745 --> 01:18:46,345
Speaker 7:  if you had guns and also like had to do some survival stuff

1317
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:47,945
Speaker 7:  and people are like just

1318
01:18:47,945 --> 01:18:49,265
Speaker 3:  A dash of survival stuff. Just

1319
01:18:49,385 --> 01:18:52,825
Speaker 7:  A little dash, just a little sprinkle. And apparently people are really,

1320
01:18:52,825 --> 01:18:54,345
Speaker 7:  really into that right now. Yeah. So

1321
01:18:54,365 --> 01:18:57,105
Speaker 3:  Do you think, is Nintendo gonna take down the main Palworld game that they're

1322
01:18:57,105 --> 01:18:59,545
Speaker 3:  not the not, I understand 'cause the mod was just like, what if I stole your

1323
01:18:59,545 --> 01:19:00,785
Speaker 3:  characters? They're

1324
01:19:00,785 --> 01:19:01,105
Speaker 7:  Like, no.

1325
01:19:01,175 --> 01:19:02,865
Speaker 3:  Yeah, that's like pretty cut and dry.

1326
01:19:02,975 --> 01:19:05,905
Speaker 7:  Yeah. He hadn't even released the mod. He'd just been like, I'm working on

1327
01:19:05,905 --> 01:19:08,945
Speaker 7:  it. And like showed some videos and Nintendo was in his inbox immediately.

1328
01:19:08,945 --> 01:19:12,345
Speaker 7:  Like, you're not, you are gonna stop that work right now.

1329
01:19:12,765 --> 01:19:16,425
Speaker 7:  The the Pokemon company says it is going to investigate Palworld because

1330
01:19:16,765 --> 01:19:20,665
Speaker 7:  it feels like, oh you do, you do cute creatures that you can capture.

1331
01:19:21,245 --> 01:19:24,945
Speaker 7:  We do cute creatures. You can capture, you use guns. We don't

1332
01:19:25,165 --> 01:19:28,705
Speaker 7:  and actually have a problem with you doing that. So it'll be a very

1333
01:19:28,985 --> 01:19:29,225
Speaker 7:  interesting

1334
01:19:29,815 --> 01:19:32,345
Speaker 3:  It's situation. But it's not actually the Pokemon, it's not, they just look

1335
01:19:32,345 --> 01:19:32,865
Speaker 3:  a lot like the Pokemon.

1336
01:19:33,015 --> 01:19:35,345
Speaker 7:  Yeah. They just, yeah, they're very similar. Is it

1337
01:19:35,345 --> 01:19:36,065
Speaker 3:  Like they're

1338
01:19:36,065 --> 01:19:36,465
Speaker 7:  Very cute

1339
01:19:36,835 --> 01:19:38,185
Speaker 3:  Freak achu. Yeah.

1340
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:42,345
Speaker 6:  It's not, they vibe like Pokemon in like a very real way. Like

1341
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:46,265
Speaker 6:  if you didn't know the difference and you just shoved these

1342
01:19:46,935 --> 01:19:50,385
Speaker 6:  into a photo of a bunch of Pokemon, they would just fit.

1343
01:19:50,615 --> 01:19:53,745
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. So, so it is, it's close enough that

1344
01:19:54,315 --> 01:19:58,225
Speaker 7:  we're gonna have a three hour special episode of The Vergecast with

1345
01:19:58,295 --> 01:19:58,945
Speaker 7:  NELI explaining

1346
01:19:59,385 --> 01:20:00,665
Speaker 3:  Everyone loves copyright the

1347
01:20:00,665 --> 01:20:04,465
Speaker 7:  Copyright of this situation. 'cause it's kind of weird, but Yeah, Nintendo

1348
01:20:04,465 --> 01:20:08,045
Speaker 7:  is, is not crazy about Pokemon with guns. So

1349
01:20:08,185 --> 01:20:10,525
Speaker 3:  It seems, it seems like they wouldn't be Yeah. It doesn't seem like they,

1350
01:20:10,665 --> 01:20:11,725
Speaker 7:  That's, that's not their thing.

1351
01:20:11,945 --> 01:20:15,365
Speaker 6:  But the whole rest of the world seems to be, didn't I read that? It's, it's

1352
01:20:15,365 --> 01:20:19,125
Speaker 6:  like on pace to be the most popular game on

1353
01:20:19,125 --> 01:20:20,245
Speaker 6:  Steam, like ever. Like

1354
01:20:20,245 --> 01:20:23,765
Speaker 7:  There's a bunch of different metrics Steam uses and one of them is most concurrent

1355
01:20:23,765 --> 01:20:27,685
Speaker 7:  players. And for years now, player Underground

1356
01:20:28,035 --> 01:20:30,045
Speaker 7:  Battlegrounds, was that the name? Its called PUG

1357
01:20:30,345 --> 01:20:32,605
Speaker 6:  Pg. Like only nerds use the whole name. I don't, I hate to

1358
01:20:32,605 --> 01:20:36,445
Speaker 7:  Be the word. You know. So PUG was, was, was is has

1359
01:20:36,445 --> 01:20:40,205
Speaker 7:  been the most played game concurrently and it seems like Pok,

1360
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:44,405
Speaker 7:  excuse me, not Pokemon Palworld could, it's like the

1361
01:20:44,405 --> 01:20:44,765
Speaker 6:  In slit

1362
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:49,045
Speaker 7:  Could, could take that, that, that title and, and pretty quickly too.

1363
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:51,725
Speaker 7:  So we'll see. But also, how long will people play it?

1364
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:56,695
Speaker 7:  Unclear. Everybody's really into it this week. They may not be into it next

1365
01:20:56,695 --> 01:20:57,095
Speaker 7:  week. Yeah.

1366
01:20:57,095 --> 01:20:58,815
Speaker 6:  There may not be a game to play next week.

1367
01:20:59,495 --> 01:21:01,935
Speaker 7:  Nintendo may have just shut that down. Yeah, we'll see.

1368
01:21:02,865 --> 01:21:05,535
Speaker 3:  Touch the nature of steam popularity it feels like, right?

1369
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:06,815
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. A lot of times

1370
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:10,335
Speaker 3:  It goes. All right, I've got one last one. All right. Which is actually an

1371
01:21:10,335 --> 01:21:12,815
Speaker 3:  old story that David already mentioned, but he forgot to mention the, the

1372
01:21:12,815 --> 01:21:13,575
Speaker 3:  most important part.

1373
01:21:16,595 --> 01:21:19,735
Speaker 3:  So David did mention that Tim Sweeney had replied

1374
01:21:21,035 --> 01:21:24,895
Speaker 3:  to the app store changes and Apple's responses to them. And it's true, Tim

1375
01:21:24,895 --> 01:21:28,695
Speaker 3:  Sweeney did refer to them as malicious compliance. What David failed to

1376
01:21:28,695 --> 01:21:28,895
Speaker 3:  mention

1377
01:21:31,405 --> 01:21:34,905
Speaker 3:  was that he also called them hot Garbage. Yes. And

1378
01:21:35,185 --> 01:21:39,145
Speaker 3:  quote, it will take more time to parse both the

1379
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:41,665
Speaker 3:  written and unwritten parts of this new horror show.

1380
01:21:42,245 --> 01:21:45,985
Speaker 6:  That's very good. But can I, can I drop some breaking

1381
01:21:46,015 --> 01:21:48,905
Speaker 6:  news on you? Fort tweet? There's Breaking News. Just tweeted that it's coming

1382
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:51,585
Speaker 6:  back in the Epic game store

1383
01:21:52,615 --> 01:21:55,625
Speaker 6:  fort. It says later this year, Fortnite will return in Europe on iOS through

1384
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:57,625
Speaker 6:  the Epic game store. Shout out

1385
01:21:57,825 --> 01:22:01,865
Speaker 3:  DMAI.

1386
01:22:01,965 --> 01:22:05,185
Speaker 6:  So it's like, yeah, Tim Sweeney hates it and is going to

1387
01:22:05,815 --> 01:22:08,425
Speaker 6:  take advantage of it at every available turn.

1388
01:22:08,795 --> 01:22:09,465
Speaker 7:  Bless Tim.

1389
01:22:10,135 --> 01:22:13,985
Speaker 3:  It's good. You need more idealistic. Yeah. Fortnite makers,

1390
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:14,425
Speaker 3:  I

1391
01:22:14,425 --> 01:22:17,465
Speaker 6:  Will say we've seen at least two just in the time we've been recording this

1392
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:20,545
Speaker 6:  podcast, at least two alternate app stores

1393
01:22:20,915 --> 01:22:23,945
Speaker 6:  announcing that they're already beginning the process to becoming

1394
01:22:24,765 --> 01:22:25,985
Speaker 6:  an app marketplace on

1395
01:22:26,045 --> 01:22:26,825
Speaker 7:  IOS. How much porn?

1396
01:22:28,255 --> 01:22:32,065
Speaker 6:  Unclear. Okay. I can tell you one of them is, it's called the Alt Store

1397
01:22:32,205 --> 01:22:36,065
Speaker 6:  and it's started as this app Delta, which

1398
01:22:36,145 --> 01:22:39,865
Speaker 6:  originally was an app called GBA for iOS, which is a way to play

1399
01:22:39,935 --> 01:22:43,825
Speaker 6:  Game Boy ROMs. Yeah. On your iPhone, which is a thing Apple explicitly

1400
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:47,785
Speaker 6:  does not allow. And now in theory, under this rule would

1401
01:22:47,785 --> 01:22:51,745
Speaker 6:  be perfectly allowable to do through an app marketplace.

1402
01:22:51,745 --> 01:22:53,945
Speaker 6:  Great. So like that's, that's coming, that's one of the ones that announced

1403
01:22:53,945 --> 01:22:55,665
Speaker 6:  they're, they're already working on this. Like it's gonna

1404
01:22:55,665 --> 01:22:58,625
Speaker 7:  Happen. I'll finally have a reason for that. That controller that I, you

1405
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:01,665
Speaker 7:  can put on your iPhone. I never do it. 'cause I'm like, I only wanna play

1406
01:23:01,825 --> 01:23:05,645
Speaker 7:  ROMs and don don't wanna do that on, on the, that I legally own the games.

1407
01:23:05,785 --> 01:23:07,605
Speaker 7:  Of course, you should always legally own the games

1408
01:23:07,845 --> 01:23:10,245
Speaker 3:  I don not. I'm a hundred percent certain that, that it's still not legal

1409
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:13,325
Speaker 3:  and that is just some folk wisdom. But the rom market is not big enough for

1410
01:23:13,325 --> 01:23:13,845
Speaker 3:  anyone to care.

1411
01:23:14,085 --> 01:23:17,885
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So please don't sue me for that. I supported you in your PE worlds.

1412
01:23:17,955 --> 01:23:18,245
Speaker 7:  It's

1413
01:23:18,245 --> 01:23:20,645
Speaker 6:  Okay. Yeah. Nintendo has bigger fish to fry at the moment, so you're you're

1414
01:23:20,645 --> 01:23:21,005
Speaker 6:  fine. Leave

1415
01:23:21,005 --> 01:23:24,965
Speaker 3:  Me alone. Oh my gosh. All right. Well, I'm gonna start a gambling store.

1416
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,885
Speaker 3:  From what I understand, gambling is very lucrative,

1417
01:23:29,545 --> 01:23:31,925
Speaker 3:  so catch me in the gambling store, NELI

1418
01:23:32,235 --> 01:23:36,205
Speaker 6:  Porn, crypto and Gambling Depot coming to iOS in 2024.

1419
01:23:37,005 --> 01:23:40,845
Speaker 3:  I mean, just historically lucrative ideas.

1420
01:23:41,365 --> 01:23:45,245
Speaker 3:  Let's, let's, she wants to talk. Wouldn't I be

1421
01:23:45,245 --> 01:23:49,125
Speaker 3:  good at, I don't even gamble. First of all, this is true. Every

1422
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:52,765
Speaker 3:  year at css I go to Vegas and whatever money other people are spending gambling,

1423
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:56,525
Speaker 3:  I just use that money. I spend the same money, but I buy limousines. And

1424
01:23:56,525 --> 01:23:58,205
Speaker 3:  I promise you this is true. I've been doing it for years.

1425
01:23:58,695 --> 01:23:59,445
Speaker 6:  Douch for this. Yeah. Yeah.

1426
01:23:59,465 --> 01:24:03,285
Speaker 3:  We, we had a limo this year and everyone talks more about the limousine than

1427
01:24:03,285 --> 01:24:05,005
Speaker 3:  they talk about gambling at the end. It's,

1428
01:24:05,005 --> 01:24:08,845
Speaker 7:  It's true. I drank Bud Light out of a champagne crew. It's

1429
01:24:08,845 --> 01:24:10,045
Speaker 7:  beautiful. A

1430
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,805
Speaker 3:  Wonderful moment. It was a good limo, except when Andrew took over the

1431
01:24:14,005 --> 01:24:17,525
Speaker 3:  ox and started playing some deeply weird shit in that car. That's it. That's

1432
01:24:17,525 --> 01:24:21,085
Speaker 3:  a Verge cast. We'll be back next week. There's it's
