Description: Today on the flagship podcast of dedicated streaming hardware: 
We try out a couple of show formats we’ve been planning for a while. 
In Version History, we tell the story of the Roku Netflix Player, debate its legacy, and try to decide whether this thing belongs in the Version History Hall of Fame.

00:00:02,675 --> 00:00:06,405
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of dedicated streaming

3
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:10,285
Speaker 2:  hardware. I'm your friend David Pierce, and if you're seeing this, I'm already

4
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:14,005
Speaker 2:  dead. I'm just kidding. I'm on vacation right now as you're listening to

5
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:17,765
Speaker 2:  this or seeing it on YouTube. I am probably in the woods of

6
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:21,725
Speaker 2:  Vermont, I don't know, running up and down a mountain or whatever you do

7
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:25,565
Speaker 2:  when you're in the woods. The point was just to like get away, find somewhere

8
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:29,205
Speaker 2:  with fewer screens and more trees and just spend two weeks

9
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:33,405
Speaker 2:  detoxing. And detoxing sounds like more aggressive than I actually mean it.

10
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:37,045
Speaker 2:  I kind of like life with screens. It's all, I think mostly fine, but it's

11
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:40,485
Speaker 2:  nice to have a break every once in a while and I will say when I go even

12
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:44,005
Speaker 2:  like a day or two sort of deliberately turning all of that off,

13
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:48,525
Speaker 2:  it is really rejuvenating in a way that just totally resetting usually is.

14
00:00:49,185 --> 00:00:52,925
Speaker 2:  Anyway, while I'm gone, we've prepared some really fun stuff for you over

15
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:56,645
Speaker 2:  the next two twos. So we're forever experimenting with new

16
00:00:56,695 --> 00:01:00,285
Speaker 2:  ideas and new formats and even new shows we might wanna launch at The Verge.

17
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:04,405
Speaker 2:  And mostly they just live like in meetings and Google Docs and their

18
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:08,285
Speaker 2:  ideas and things we wanna do. But we figured while I'm gone, let's try some

19
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:11,445
Speaker 2:  stuff out. So what you're gonna hear from us over the next two weeks is two

20
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:15,285
Speaker 2:  versions of two different ideas we've had. One

21
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:19,365
Speaker 2:  is kind of a rewatch show and one is kind of a debate show. Just new ways

22
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:22,125
Speaker 2:  to talk about tech. Still should still feel like The Vergecast, it's gonna

23
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:26,005
Speaker 2:  be people you recognize. But we wanted to just try some new ways of talking

24
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:29,445
Speaker 2:  about this stuff that we don't do on this show. Typically. Maybe there'll

25
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:32,205
Speaker 2:  be segments, maybe there'll be new shows, maybe you'll hate them and we'll

26
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:36,085
Speaker 2:  never do them again. Who knows? But we're gonna try some stuff. So the reason

27
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:39,525
Speaker 2:  I tell you all this is because I genuinely want to know what you think of

28
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:43,085
Speaker 2:  all of this as you listen or as you watch, tell us what you think. Do you

29
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:45,525
Speaker 2:  like these formats? Do you wish we asked different questions? Do you wish

30
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:48,845
Speaker 2:  we structured them slightly differently? Do you have other show ideas or

31
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:52,325
Speaker 2:  format ideas you think that we should do inside of The Vergecast? I want

32
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:55,525
Speaker 2:  to hear everything. We want all of your feedback all the time, but especially

33
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:58,725
Speaker 2:  on this, this is deliberately us just being like, these are things we've

34
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:01,805
Speaker 2:  been talking about for somewhere between months and years. We wanna know

35
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:05,525
Speaker 2:  what you think So. anyway, all of that is to say should be fun.

36
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,365
Speaker 2:  We're trying new things. I'm nervous about this episode in a way that I think

37
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:12,325
Speaker 2:  is very fun. So I'm gonna go back to vacation. I hope you enjoy. This is

38
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:13,685
Speaker 2:  The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

39
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,885
Speaker 2:  Wing Weekly was a big one. There's the re watchable on the Ringer, that's

40
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:37,565
Speaker 2:  pretty popular. There are a million of these and I really enjoy them. It

41
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:41,485
Speaker 2:  seems like every Star at some point during the pandemic was like, I'll do

42
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:45,365
Speaker 2:  a rewatch podcast and I will happily listen to all of them. So our idea was

43
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:48,325
Speaker 2:  how do we do this for tech, right? There are all these stories out there

44
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:52,445
Speaker 2:  of individual gadgets or apps or kind of these

45
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:55,725
Speaker 2:  contained stories that we felt like we could go through and talk about in

46
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:59,485
Speaker 2:  similar ways. A lot of them, we at The, Verge lived through. We used them,

47
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:02,365
Speaker 2:  we wrote about them, we covered them. And there are lots of stories that

48
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:06,285
Speaker 2:  we have from those days that are just fun to talk about again. Plus it's

49
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:10,045
Speaker 2:  a good way to kind of go back in history and talk about how we got here,

50
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:13,365
Speaker 2:  right? There's a lot of good ways to talk about the history of the tech industry,

51
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:17,685
Speaker 2:  but doing it kind of one gadget and device and app at a time felt

52
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:20,285
Speaker 2:  like a really fun way to do it. So we've been kicking around this format

53
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:23,885
Speaker 2:  for a long time. I've been kind of borrowing and stealing things from other

54
00:04:24,085 --> 00:04:27,285
Speaker 2:  rewatch podcasts that I really like and we've put together something, we're

55
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:30,405
Speaker 2:  calling it version history. I don't know if that's actually the name. I don't

56
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:34,285
Speaker 2:  know if this is a good idea at all, but we've recorded a couple of them

57
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:37,885
Speaker 2:  now and it's been really fun. So I hope you enjoy them as much as we did.

58
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:41,885
Speaker 2:  The first one is about the very, very, very first Roku

59
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:42,525
Speaker 2:  here goes.

60
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:52,805
Speaker 2:  All right, Alex Krantz. Hello. Hey, what's up Neela Patel,

61
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:56,725
Speaker 2:  welcome. You're dead to me. This, this is how we like to start

62
00:04:56,775 --> 00:05:00,405
Speaker 2:  every, this is great. We're starting a thing. I'm on vacation.

63
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:04,565
Speaker 2:  It's the whole thing. So the thing we are going to talk about in this first

64
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:08,525
Speaker 2:  segment is the original Roku. It's called the

65
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:11,365
Speaker 2:  Roku Netflix Player. And here's how we're gonna do this. We're gonna basically,

66
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:15,605
Speaker 2:  there are three pieces of this show that we're gonna try to do here

67
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:19,285
Speaker 2:  and I think if we end up doing these longer episodes, there will be more.

68
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:22,365
Speaker 2:  But what we're gonna do is I've broken it down to three pieces. We have like

69
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,645
Speaker 2:  a brief history lesson. I have a whole bunch of notes. So I'm gonna like

70
00:05:25,645 --> 00:05:29,125
Speaker 2:  tell you the brief story of this thing. Y'all should chime in and have feelings

71
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,125
Speaker 2:  and thoughts. We're gonna talk about how people felt about it. I've looked

72
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,805
Speaker 2:  up a bunch of reviews, I have a lot of like funny stuff I wanna show you.

73
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:38,765
Speaker 2:  And then we have some questions that we're gonna see if we can figure out

74
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:42,125
Speaker 2:  this thing's legacy and whether it matters. And then we are starting a thing

75
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,405
Speaker 2:  called the version History Hall of Fame. That's all I've decided about it

76
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:48,405
Speaker 2:  so far. But then at the end we're gonna decide whether this thing belongs

77
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:52,245
Speaker 2:  in the Hall of Fame. So the Roku Netflix player. So this goes all the way

78
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:56,125
Speaker 2:  back to like 2002. This guy Anthony Wood, starts

79
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:59,445
Speaker 2:  a company called Roku originally to build music

80
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:02,845
Speaker 2:  products. They built a couple of things that you've never heard of that don't

81
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:06,045
Speaker 2:  really matter, but also at the same time, Netflix, this company that shipped

82
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:09,685
Speaker 2:  DVDs to people, decided that they wanted to build hardware. They wanted to

83
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:13,565
Speaker 2:  like have a box for this new instant watch thing that they

84
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:17,045
Speaker 2:  had on Netflix where you could watch TV shows on the internet,

85
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,885
Speaker 2:  which was quite a thing.

86
00:06:19,185 --> 00:06:21,485
Speaker 5:  Was it because they knew that Silver light sucks?

87
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:25,885
Speaker 2:  So no. Oh I mean debatable. Okay.

88
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:29,245
Speaker 2:  The only place, this is a good point. The only place at this moment that

89
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:33,005
Speaker 2:  you could watch Netflix shows on the internet was on a Windows computer through

90
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:36,885
Speaker 2:  Internet Explorer. Because of Silverlight there was a lot of

91
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:39,845
Speaker 2:  enthusiasm about Silverlight coming to other platforms, which is a very funny

92
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:41,725
Speaker 2:  thing to read about all these years later.

93
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:45,845
Speaker 6:  I think we need to stop and remind our audience that Silverlight was

94
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:49,485
Speaker 6:  Microsoft's competitor to Adobe Flash. And that Adobe Flash was

95
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:53,565
Speaker 6:  Adobe's Ill faded media platform for the web where you had

96
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:57,565
Speaker 6:  plugins in your browser and you could run entire games and

97
00:06:57,565 --> 00:07:01,245
Speaker 6:  applications. But inside like Adobe's weird framework, I'm only saying this

98
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:05,085
Speaker 6:  because we have an audience that is young and this was a thing that happened

99
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:08,365
Speaker 6:  to all, like it was just made to happen to us. Yeah,

100
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:09,965
Speaker 5:  We had no choice in the matter. And

101
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:13,565
Speaker 2:  There was a time that Flash was considered like very good. Yeah. And Silver

102
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:16,845
Speaker 2:  Light was kind of a, a would be competitor to Flash

103
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:19,285
Speaker 6:  Would be is very accurate. Yeah,

104
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:22,885
Speaker 2:  It was. It was a, it was a pretender to the throne of a Toby Flash

105
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,485
Speaker 6:  When the first iPhone came out. It was a major controversy that it didn't

106
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:30,325
Speaker 6:  run flash or silver light or is craft compressor. Oh yeah,

107
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:33,645
Speaker 6:  that's where we are. We we're we're many, many, many years away from this.

108
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:37,085
Speaker 6:  Yes, yes. I'm just pointing out that at the time Netflix was like, we're

109
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:40,565
Speaker 6:  betting on not Flash, which was in itself bananas.

110
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:44,045
Speaker 6:  But like the whole web was built on these like weird plugins. Yes.

111
00:07:44,145 --> 00:07:47,805
Speaker 2:  No that that's right. That is so that is, that is good context. So at some

112
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:51,485
Speaker 2:  point in this process, Anthony Wood meets Reed Hastings, the

113
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:55,165
Speaker 2:  CEO of Netflix at a conference. And this is where there is some

114
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:58,885
Speaker 2:  disagreement on the history, but I believe the actual correct answer

115
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:03,085
Speaker 2:  is that Anthony Wood convinces Reed Hastings to partner with his company

116
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:06,925
Speaker 2:  Roku, to build a player for Netflix.

117
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:11,365
Speaker 2:  Anthony Wood was not a Netflix employee, he was kind of a Netflix employee,

118
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:15,045
Speaker 2:  but he was like a contractor who was hired to work there. Roku was always

119
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:17,965
Speaker 2:  a separate company. This is the thing a lot of people get wrong. In retrospect,

120
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:22,205
Speaker 2:  Roku did not spin out of Netflix. Roku was its own thing that worked with

121
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:25,285
Speaker 2:  Netflix But. anyway, they go through, they start building this thing called

122
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:29,365
Speaker 2:  Project Griffin that is basically going to be a box through which You can

123
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:33,005
Speaker 2:  play Netflix on your television and a team of about 20 people

124
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:35,925
Speaker 2:  work on it for a while. They get it ready, they get it done, it's gonna be

125
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:38,445
Speaker 2:  a box, it's gonna be a streaming box. Everybody's very excited. And then

126
00:08:38,535 --> 00:08:42,325
Speaker 2:  right before the thing ships, Reed Hastings gets cold feet and

127
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:46,205
Speaker 2:  says basically, I am afraid that we are

128
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:50,125
Speaker 2:  going to alienate all of our partners by making hardware and

129
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,405
Speaker 2:  that if they mail, if they make a Netflix box, they are going to

130
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:56,845
Speaker 2:  lose all of these other companies that they wanna work with to put Netflix

131
00:08:57,065 --> 00:08:59,805
Speaker 2:  on all the screens everywhere. They had made other partnerships, they were

132
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,565
Speaker 2:  talking to Apple and lots of others about putting Netflix on other devices

133
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:06,285
Speaker 2:  and thought if they made their own, they would piss people off. So instead

134
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:10,525
Speaker 2:  they basically give this project back to Roku and they gave

135
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:14,205
Speaker 2:  them some people, some patents, the all the work they had done so far

136
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:18,285
Speaker 2:  and in return got, I think it was 15% of Roku,

137
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:22,485
Speaker 2:  which spoiler alert they sold and should have held onto for

138
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:23,925
Speaker 2:  a very long time. Netflix

139
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:25,165
Speaker 6:  Does not have Diamond Hands.

140
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:29,205
Speaker 2:  No, not, not in that case. Certainly. So then in

141
00:09:29,815 --> 00:09:33,725
Speaker 2:  March of 2008, the the Roku internet player

142
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:37,525
Speaker 2:  gets launched. And again, just to give you a sense of of timing there, at

143
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:41,285
Speaker 2:  that time Netflix had just reported that it had 8 million subscribers. Most

144
00:09:41,285 --> 00:09:45,245
Speaker 2:  people were on DVDs. Again, the only way you could stream Netflix

145
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:49,165
Speaker 2:  at the time was on a Windows PC through Internet Explorer. Nothing did

146
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:52,845
Speaker 2:  unlimited streaming like this. It like wasn't a thing that you could do

147
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:56,765
Speaker 2:  the, the whole watch instantly thing on Netflix. Brand new, very

148
00:09:57,005 --> 00:10:00,005
Speaker 2:  exciting. Nila, you'll, you'll appreciate this particularly, I wrote down

149
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:03,845
Speaker 2:  the list of ports that the Roku Netflix player had. It had an HTMI

150
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:06,765
Speaker 2:  port. It had component ports, it had composite ports. It had an ethernet

151
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:09,965
Speaker 2:  jack, it had S video and it had optical ports. Yeah,

152
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:11,085
Speaker 6:  Everything I love

153
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:14,045
Speaker 2:  It. We call that Yeah, that's the full, the full Port

154
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:18,445
Speaker 6:  S video is a is you're like, I am not interested in quality but I

155
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:19,925
Speaker 6:  want to pretend that I am. Yeah.

156
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:25,525
Speaker 2:  So it costs $99. Do either of you have memories of the

157
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:29,245
Speaker 2:  first ever Netflix box? I do as big streaming nerds. Ne

158
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:32,285
Speaker 2:  you. Yeah. You were at Eng Gadget, like chronicling this stuff. There was

159
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:33,965
Speaker 2:  a lot of Eng Gadget stuff back then. Yeah.

160
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:38,085
Speaker 6:  A OL has since deleted those posts from the internet. I went looking for

161
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:42,125
Speaker 6:  'em. They're gone. Yeah. But we wrote a lot about this device because it

162
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:46,085
Speaker 6:  was, like you said, the first mainstream streaming device, Netflix's

163
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:48,725
Speaker 6:  catalog is really small. So there's a lot of jokes about what you couldn't,

164
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:52,565
Speaker 6:  could not watch on it, but it was like obvious that gadget

165
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:55,925
Speaker 6:  nerds would love this thing. And then the fury about it

166
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:59,925
Speaker 6:  was that it was only four a DI which really explains that S video port.

167
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:04,605
Speaker 6:  Yes. Right. Like this thing could stream in in interlaced sd.

168
00:11:05,185 --> 00:11:09,085
Speaker 6:  So it was, they were trying very hard to conserve bandwidth and in

169
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:13,005
Speaker 6:  an early preview of don't ever bet on someone to issue a software

170
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,885
Speaker 6:  update, they kept telling us that it also supported 10 a DI

171
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:20,805
Speaker 2:  And they alluded to maybe doing more than just stereo sound too.

172
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:24,125
Speaker 2:  There were lots of big ideas about like, oh this box is very powerful, it'll

173
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,325
Speaker 2:  do lots of other stuff. Yeah.

174
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:28,645
Speaker 6:  And then those software updates never came. Yeah. and it became the jaded

175
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:32,045
Speaker 6:  monster that I am now. But the, the idea was so sound

176
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:36,205
Speaker 6:  and then the question was do you want a single appliance for a single

177
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:39,565
Speaker 6:  app, right. That only has Netflix, it's catalog. Can Netflix make its catalog

178
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:43,445
Speaker 6:  big enough? And you kind of just like immediately got into all of the streaming

179
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:46,445
Speaker 6:  questions from this one little box that had a tiny catalog that streamed

180
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:50,365
Speaker 6:  in 40 I and was a little glitchy. You know like none of this technology worked

181
00:11:50,365 --> 00:11:54,085
Speaker 6:  yet. There was, at that time there were still, it's hard to believe major

182
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:58,405
Speaker 6:  questions about whether the internet was architected to stream video

183
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,245
Speaker 6:  in this way.

184
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:02,005
Speaker 2:  Like infrastructural, like physically if it could

185
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:05,245
Speaker 6:  Do it, You can. Yeah. Whether like a packet switch network like the internet

186
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:07,685
Speaker 6:  could do. and it's like now you're like, what are you talking about? I can

187
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,445
Speaker 6:  do this on my phone, whatever I want. Like at the time

188
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,325
Speaker 6:  there was, there were like architecture questions and Comcast and another

189
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:18,205
Speaker 6:  big ISPs, if you will remember around the same time were

190
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:21,965
Speaker 6:  like, if you plug your Xbox into a Comcast connection,

191
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:26,125
Speaker 6:  we will give it a dedicated lane of broadband

192
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:30,405
Speaker 6:  so we can serve it. Video disclosure at Comcast is an investor, Fox

193
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:33,885
Speaker 6:  Media, you know, all this, that idea did not work and actually got in a lot

194
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:37,005
Speaker 6:  of trouble over it. 'cause that was the beginning of like a net neutrality

195
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:40,565
Speaker 6:  fight. But like in, its like primitive state. But it came outta something

196
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:44,125
Speaker 6:  very sincere, which is like, can the internet do video? And the Netflix box

197
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:47,805
Speaker 6:  was the first thing that was like, we will just stream video to you. We'll

198
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:48,485
Speaker 6:  figure this out.

199
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:51,165
Speaker 2:  Kranz, do you, did you have one of these? Do you remember this thing coming

200
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:51,365
Speaker 2:  out?

201
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:55,605
Speaker 5:  No, I didn't have one because it didn't run Plex. I, I really

202
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:59,925
Speaker 5:  wanted to be super into Netflix streaming at the time, but I only had

203
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:03,805
Speaker 5:  Max and the Windows Silver Light thing. So I was like f this noise, I'm going

204
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:07,885
Speaker 5:  full plex and it couldn't run Plex. So I was like,

205
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:08,765
Speaker 5:  I don't, why do I do that?

206
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:11,725
Speaker 2:  I honestly thought that was a bit Plex has been around that long.

207
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I've been on Plex since like 2008.

208
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:15,165
Speaker 2:  That's nuts.

209
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:18,685
Speaker 5:  It was originally, it's a spinoff of Xbox Media Center

210
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:20,005
Speaker 5:  XPMC.

211
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:24,085
Speaker 2:  Wow. So this is, this is how old all this stuff is. Like those are the days.

212
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:28,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I appreciate that you skipped right past let's find the

213
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:32,005
Speaker 2:  like useful way and went straight to just pirated chaos.

214
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:33,045
Speaker 2:  I love this for you.

215
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:37,285
Speaker 5:  Look, the useful way came later than, than the pirated chaos

216
00:13:37,545 --> 00:13:39,885
Speaker 5:  useful way was like so far behind everybody else.

217
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:44,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I'm, I'm glad you were also early to the let me get a movie

218
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:47,765
Speaker 2:  on Netflix, rip it to my computer and then ship it back to Netflix because

219
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:51,565
Speaker 2:  that was like the single best use of Netflix that existed. It ruled.

220
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:55,125
Speaker 2:  So Neli, you, you mentioned some of these things, but I went back through

221
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,765
Speaker 2:  a bunch of the reviews of this thing, which are very funny. I would say the

222
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:02,445
Speaker 2:  thing people liked most was how easy it was to set up.

223
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:06,725
Speaker 2:  You could just plug it into whatever TV you had and log into Netflix.

224
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:11,045
Speaker 2:  It did the code thing where you would like log in on Netflix's website and

225
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:14,125
Speaker 2:  enter a code and it would connect that way, which was way ahead of its time.

226
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:17,605
Speaker 2:  People were very annoyed by typing in their wifi password on a like

227
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:21,605
Speaker 2:  five arrow cursor, which still annoying. So

228
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:22,925
Speaker 2:  kudos to everybody for figuring that

229
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:25,805
Speaker 6:  Out. I just wanna point out it's been like 20 years and no one has better

230
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:26,005
Speaker 6:  ideas.

231
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:29,765
Speaker 2:  That is still the best interface we have. It's ridiculous. But the two things

232
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:33,925
Speaker 2:  that annoyed people were one, as you said Neli the selection.

233
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:38,005
Speaker 2:  And this was at the time Netflix said it had about a hundred thousand things

234
00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:41,365
Speaker 2:  that you could get, which is much larger than the Netflix library today.

235
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:44,925
Speaker 2:  Most of that stuff was on DVDs and the streaming stuff was only about 10,000

236
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,605
Speaker 2:  titles. And that included like individual episodes of TV shows.

237
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:51,900
Speaker 2:  I have a quote from cnet, which I very much enjoyed that said March of the

238
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,925
Speaker 2:  Penguins is the only movie in the top 100 that's available for streaming.

239
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:59,165
Speaker 2:  And it's also only one of four streamable documentaries. There

240
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:02,725
Speaker 2:  was 30 Rock, there was the office. So like I would've been fine, but for

241
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:05,525
Speaker 2:  the most part people were unhappy about it. One thing I very much enjoyed,

242
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:09,285
Speaker 2:  people were psyched that it only took about a minute to

243
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:13,005
Speaker 2:  load a video. This was like a, this was like a win was when you press play,

244
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:16,445
Speaker 2:  it only took about a minute to start playing. And this was back in the buffering

245
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:19,965
Speaker 2:  days when you would just sit and like wait for Netflix to

246
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:24,285
Speaker 2:  chug its way through. It is impossible for me to remember when that

247
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:27,445
Speaker 2:  would've felt fast to the point where now it's like that would, I would turn

248
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:29,245
Speaker 2:  off my television and be like, something is broken.

249
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:32,245
Speaker 6:  I mean think about back then people having

250
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:37,205
Speaker 6:  megabit internet connections was still

251
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:41,165
Speaker 6:  like, it wasn't unusual but it was rare enough, right?

252
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:44,965
Speaker 6:  That you couldn't just count on it. Like I graduated from law school

253
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:48,045
Speaker 6:  in 2006 with a megabit internet connection and I was like, yeah

254
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:52,605
Speaker 6:  that was that moment. Like bandwidth was not a thing

255
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:57,125
Speaker 6:  and Netflix was trying to cram this device into an internet that

256
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,205
Speaker 6:  was just not ready for it.

257
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:01,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah. There there were a bunch of people talking about their internet speeds

258
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,565
Speaker 2:  in in their reviews and a bunch of folks were like, oh yeah, I

259
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:09,245
Speaker 2:  have a one megabit per second connection and it, it does fine. And then somebody

260
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:13,085
Speaker 2:  was like, I have a 2.2 megabits per second connection and it's sick. It's

261
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:14,845
Speaker 2:  like fast as hell guys. You don't even know.

262
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,605
Speaker 2:  Which I, I loved,

263
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:21,645
Speaker 6:  Again, for a young audience, a megabit is a unit of bandwidth is much smaller.

264
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:26,205
Speaker 2:  Imagine if your current internet connection was 1000th the speed

265
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:30,005
Speaker 2:  that it currently is. That's what we're talking about. And also

266
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:33,885
Speaker 2:  the, the thing that Netflix did to make this thing work was it was

267
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:37,765
Speaker 2:  just a player you couldn't search at the beginning. You couldn't find stuff,

268
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:41,565
Speaker 2:  you couldn't browse. You would put things in your queue on netflix.com

269
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:44,565
Speaker 2:  and then you would go to the player and you could browse through your queue

270
00:16:44,585 --> 00:16:47,725
Speaker 2:  and pick stuff to watch people had, you had two different cues. This is a

271
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:50,805
Speaker 2:  thing I had forgotten. You had a DVD queue and you had a streaming queue

272
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:53,925
Speaker 2:  and this, that was true for like years and I had completely forgotten that

273
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:57,165
Speaker 2:  that was the case and you had to like manage what you were getting when and

274
00:16:57,165 --> 00:17:00,725
Speaker 2:  you could stream some stuff and you could DVD some stuff and it was insane

275
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,685
Speaker 2:  chaos. And I don't miss that one tiny little bit.

276
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:07,725
Speaker 6:  Well you have to remember the entire Netflix paradigm

277
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:11,485
Speaker 6:  was cues. Right? Right. So they, they had this like weird problem

278
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:15,605
Speaker 6:  where stuff that is very familiar to us now, like discovery and

279
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:19,565
Speaker 6:  algorithmic recommendations and blah blah blah, like didn't exist

280
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:23,925
Speaker 6:  because the entire Netflix model was you were gonna, we're

281
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:27,405
Speaker 6:  gonna mail you some DVDs, you're gonna mail 'em back and we'll mail you the

282
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:30,925
Speaker 6:  next ones. So even though they had recommendations, Netflix

283
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:34,605
Speaker 6:  famously had a challenge to develop a better recommendation

284
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:38,605
Speaker 6:  algorithm. The model that they were

285
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:42,325
Speaker 6:  still using was, you're gonna put physical

286
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:46,485
Speaker 6:  movies in a queue, like discs in a queue to be mailed to you.

287
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,925
Speaker 6:  And I think they didn't want to break that right away.

288
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:53,525
Speaker 5:  I thought it was a really good way of like, that was still at a time where

289
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:57,045
Speaker 5:  we hadn't fully like comprehended how instantaneous

290
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,445
Speaker 5:  media could arrive in our lives. Right. Like even music at the time was like,

291
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:04,965
Speaker 5:  wow, You can just download this off of iTunes. It was a big deal. And so

292
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:08,885
Speaker 5:  them saying, Hey You can get a whole movie. It felt like

293
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:12,805
Speaker 5:  this, this big magical moment. But also getting drunk and

294
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:15,725
Speaker 5:  then waking up the next morning and being like, what did I add to my cue

295
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:20,565
Speaker 5:  best feeling in the world. Incredible feeling when

296
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:21,125
Speaker 5:  you're in college.

297
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:25,605
Speaker 2:  Kranz, I really like imagining you like coming home from the bars at two

298
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,285
Speaker 2:  30 in the morning and be like, let's, let's Netflix Cube baby.

299
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:31,965
Speaker 5:  It was the frat houses because we didn't have bars. But yes. Okay.

300
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:36,325
Speaker 2:  That's that's good. Alright, well we, we are time constrained here so let's,

301
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:39,645
Speaker 2:  let's just jump, these are some of the, the questions we're gonna ask for

302
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:43,165
Speaker 2:  every single one of these as we go. The first one is, what was the best thing

303
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:47,325
Speaker 2:  in retrospect about this thing? To me it's just that it was a box

304
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:51,085
Speaker 2:  for streaming, right? Yeah. Like I feel like that's just the whole ne

305
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:54,045
Speaker 2:  Neli really wants it to be the s video port. I can like see it in your face.

306
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:58,445
Speaker 6:  No, I'm, I'm gonna give you like a really esoteric answer to this. Please.

307
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:02,245
Speaker 6:  It made a Roku like, okay, we've talked to

308
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:05,885
Speaker 6:  Anthony Wood on this show many times over the years. That

309
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:09,165
Speaker 6:  company just has rearchitected how

310
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:13,405
Speaker 6:  TVs work. Like fundamentally the modern

311
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:17,445
Speaker 6:  TV ecosystem. Every version of it looks like Roku's plan.

312
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:21,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And they started with this silly Netflix app but they knew what they

313
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:25,165
Speaker 6:  were making was the cable box of the future. They they knew it from the beginning.

314
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:28,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That this thing would be the cable box. They would give them away for

315
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:32,085
Speaker 6:  as cheap as they could and they would charge fees like the app store models

316
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:35,445
Speaker 6:  to all the apps that were on the thing and they would just come to dominate.

317
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:39,645
Speaker 6:  And I think that has like in some ways made the TV

318
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:43,645
Speaker 6:  world a lot weirder. It's just, it's weird out there. But

319
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:47,525
Speaker 6:  it wouldn't have happened without this device. The way that Apple and

320
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:51,525
Speaker 6:  Microsoft were going at the time was just really slow. Right. Like

321
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:54,605
Speaker 6:  the Apple TV existed, the Apple TV came out way before this. Yes. Do you

322
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:57,965
Speaker 6:  remember? It was a hobby garbage and it was basically a Mac mini with a hard

323
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:01,765
Speaker 6:  drive and you could buy movies and they would download overnight again

324
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:04,725
Speaker 6:  megabit per second internet connections. They would download overnight to

325
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:08,365
Speaker 6:  a hard drive wind. Microsoft was doing Windows Media Center. They've been

326
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:12,005
Speaker 6:  doing it for almost a decade at this point. Every CES Bill

327
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:15,525
Speaker 6:  Gates would stand on stage and be like, I'm gonna put a Windows

328
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:19,845
Speaker 6:  PC in your living room. Yep. Like just threatening America in the

329
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:23,765
Speaker 6:  world, this concept. And they were just not getting it done 'cause

330
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:27,525
Speaker 6:  they were insistent that they needed to put computers like big

331
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:30,725
Speaker 6:  computers in your living room. And so Roku showed up in this little box,

332
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:34,565
Speaker 6:  $99 didn't have much of an interface but it did the one

333
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:38,245
Speaker 6:  thing which is stream movies over the internet. And that I think

334
00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:40,125
Speaker 6:  caused just a sea change in the industry.

335
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:44,485
Speaker 2:  I agree with that. I think the, like the extent to which Roku had had

336
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:48,485
Speaker 2:  this plan fleshed all the way out from the very beginning really surprised

337
00:20:48,485 --> 00:20:51,005
Speaker 2:  me in going back and researching this. Like they were saying from the jump,

338
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:54,925
Speaker 2:  like we wanna have more apps on this. We have plans for an app store. We

339
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:58,805
Speaker 2:  like they saw the whole thing and like pulled it off in a

340
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:01,685
Speaker 2:  surprisingly coherent way over time And

341
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:04,165
Speaker 6:  Go, just go back. I would just tell you, just go back, look at the very first

342
00:21:04,215 --> 00:21:07,725
Speaker 6:  Apple tv which was a Mac mini. Yeah. It had an Intel

343
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,085
Speaker 6:  processor and a hard drive.

344
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:09,805
Speaker 2:  Yep. Yeah.

345
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:13,285
Speaker 6:  Like they were just way off in the weeds on that thing.

346
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,965
Speaker 2:  One of the knocks on some of the reviews for this thing was that you couldn't

347
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:20,645
Speaker 2:  rent or buy movies. Which is a very funny knock in retrospect.

348
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:24,645
Speaker 2:  Like being mad at Netflix for not letting you rent movies would be a is not

349
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:27,485
Speaker 2:  a thing you hear so much anymore. What was the worst thing about this thing?

350
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:29,125
Speaker 6:  Oh I mean it was a piece of junk.

351
00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:32,565
Speaker 5:  It wasn't very good. Yeah. Like it only ran Netflix

352
00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:36,685
Speaker 2:  So good. It existed bad. Everything else about it.

353
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:40,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You know I said the thing about never not believing in in software

354
00:21:40,725 --> 00:21:44,645
Speaker 6:  updates coming or like not reviewing potential. This was like

355
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:48,525
Speaker 6:  the all this is all of that is wrapped up in there. Right. We'd never review

356
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:52,005
Speaker 6:  a product based on its potential. This thing like this device,

357
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:55,525
Speaker 6:  you're like oh man the next one's gonna be great. This one on the other hand,

358
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:58,565
Speaker 6:  that's a real mess. Right? But the

359
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:01,645
Speaker 5:  Next one was great. Like the next Rokus were

360
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:02,645
Speaker 5:  exceptional.

361
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:06,965
Speaker 6:  They got there. It took a long time for Roku to, to figure out. And even

362
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:09,205
Speaker 6:  now the Roku product line is like, what are you doing

363
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:13,565
Speaker 5:  Series two They said yeah You can do Plex. And that was ah that

364
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:13,605
Speaker 5:  was,

365
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,045
Speaker 6:  See what else?

366
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:18,885
Speaker 5:  That was it. I was, I like, Roku is lead, nothing else matters.

367
00:22:19,355 --> 00:22:19,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

368
00:22:19,645 --> 00:22:22,525
Speaker 2:  The pendulum of Roku was that it got way, way better and then it got way,

369
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:26,085
Speaker 2:  way worse. Yes. And I like, I don't think it's good now but it was good for

370
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:26,485
Speaker 2:  a long time.

371
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:30,125
Speaker 6:  I feel like we, we've talked a lot about bandwidth on this episode and it,

372
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,845
Speaker 6:  it is really hard to remember a time when people's ideas

373
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:37,765
Speaker 6:  were constrained by bandwidth. And so you could see like you're like,

374
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:41,205
Speaker 6:  oh this is how it should work. I should select a movie and it should start

375
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:45,165
Speaker 6:  playing. And if you'll remember, the cable companies

376
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:48,485
Speaker 6:  had those systems. They had video on demand systems running on their weird

377
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:52,285
Speaker 6:  proprietary cable networks with horrible interfaces and bad software. Like

378
00:22:52,345 --> 00:22:55,805
Speaker 6:  all of it was bad. But those networks were optimized to let you just do video

379
00:22:55,865 --> 00:22:59,525
Speaker 6:  on demand and no one thought the internet could do it so this device could

380
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:03,445
Speaker 6:  like let you do it. Now we live in a time when people are like six G

381
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:06,925
Speaker 6:  and everyone's like What for? And they're like, we don't know. Right?

382
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:11,245
Speaker 6:  But like it, at that moment in time, the things people wanted to do were

383
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:14,885
Speaker 6:  out racing the networks, which was what made it also exciting.

384
00:23:15,485 --> 00:23:17,325
Speaker 6:  'cause you could see the networks would catch up.

385
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:21,365
Speaker 2:  All right, next question. If you could go back in time and make it before

386
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:24,765
Speaker 2:  anybody else did. So in this case you meet Reed Hastings at a conference

387
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:27,445
Speaker 2:  before Anthony Wood does. What would you do differently?

388
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:30,725
Speaker 5:  I mean I think we know NE's answer and it false CS video more

389
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:34,605
Speaker 6:  Reports, video ports. Man. It's like that first

390
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:38,445
Speaker 6:  one was was correct in its ambition. Like they,

391
00:23:38,915 --> 00:23:39,565
Speaker 6:  they got there

392
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,085
Speaker 5:  Should have had more apps on it.

393
00:23:41,305 --> 00:23:44,885
Speaker 2:  That's my answer too, actually. Go, go convince Hulu or

394
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:46,805
Speaker 2:  somebody to like also do streaming

395
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:49,965
Speaker 5:  Plex, Hulu and Boxy were all like

396
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,765
Speaker 5:  existing in 2008. At least two of those were brand new baby

397
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:59,445
Speaker 5:  concepts Boxy and, and Hulu. But like they could have done it. They could

398
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:02,485
Speaker 5:  have put some of that other stuff on there. And at the time most people who

399
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:06,765
Speaker 5:  were using streaming video and stuff, they were streaming it locally and

400
00:24:06,765 --> 00:24:10,725
Speaker 5:  they were using XBMC, they were using Plex. That's how they were getting

401
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:14,445
Speaker 5:  everything. And so the fact that Roku was late to like

402
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:18,805
Speaker 5:  net in internal network video was was a bummer 'cause

403
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:21,645
Speaker 5:  it could have been really just hit the ground running.

404
00:24:22,365 --> 00:24:26,165
Speaker 6:  I just wanna point out that Hulu launched in 2007 with only an announcement

405
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:26,765
Speaker 6:  and no content.

406
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,645
Speaker 5:  Yes. I love Hulu.

407
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:31,405
Speaker 6:  So it would've been, it would've been, you could've gotten Hulu on there.

408
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:32,045
Speaker 6:  That's what I'm

409
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:32,165
Speaker 2:  Saying.

410
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:33,645
Speaker 5:  Where was the ABC go?

411
00:24:33,745 --> 00:24:34,965
Speaker 6:  It would've just been the logo.

412
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:39,445
Speaker 5:  I wanna look at just the logo and then I want the ABC Go app.

413
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:43,725
Speaker 6:  ABC was still on go.com for up until recently. It's wonderful. So it was

414
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:47,325
Speaker 6:  ESPN. I think the idea that it was an appliance actually served it well in

415
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:51,085
Speaker 6:  its moment. 'cause remember everyone else was trying to shove computers under

416
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:54,845
Speaker 6:  your TV and you were bringing in all of these computer metaphors

417
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:59,085
Speaker 6:  and this device was like, it's just your Netflix queue, it's

418
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:03,045
Speaker 6:  just delivered here instead of in your mailbox. and it was, there was a simplicity

419
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:07,005
Speaker 6:  to it that made people think about it differently. The

420
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,405
Speaker 6:  thing I would've changed is I would've gotten Netflix to spend more money

421
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:14,365
Speaker 6:  to put at least a couple hit movies on there. 'cause every review basically

422
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:16,885
Speaker 6:  ended with, there's nothing to watch. Like This is the future where there's

423
00:25:16,885 --> 00:25:20,845
Speaker 6:  nothing to watch. And I, I think the big change would've been, hey

424
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:24,805
Speaker 6:  like let's find the money to get one blockbuster movie on here

425
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:28,085
Speaker 6:  so that people have something to watch and like they're excited about it.

426
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:28,485
Speaker 6:  Oh

427
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,005
Speaker 5:  The studios were terrified at that time though. They would've said

428
00:25:32,285 --> 00:25:36,085
Speaker 5:  absolutely not. They didn't want any of their stuff streaming that way 'cause

429
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:38,325
Speaker 5:  they thought it was gonna be like the end of how they make money

430
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:39,925
Speaker 6:  And it was Yeah. To

431
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:41,085
Speaker 2:  Be clear. Yeah they were, they were, they were

432
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:41,805
Speaker 5:  They Correct.

433
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:42,525
Speaker 6:  Hundred percent correct.

434
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:45,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But yeah, it's, it's, it's an interesting Well and I was, the next

435
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:47,765
Speaker 2:  question is actually, is there an alternate timeline in which this thing

436
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:51,565
Speaker 2:  was even more successful? Like what Parallel Universe makes the Netflix player

437
00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:54,325
Speaker 2:  an even bigger hit? And I think that's the one where Netflix starts spending

438
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,445
Speaker 2:  on original content slightly quicker.

439
00:25:56,695 --> 00:26:00,525
Speaker 6:  Right? The thing that made Netflix streaming work was years later. Yeah.

440
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,685
Speaker 6:  Right. This is like in my in. I can't help but think about this timeline

441
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:07,525
Speaker 6:  in terms of gadget plugs. 2008 was Zy Gadget, Netflix launches House of Cards.

442
00:26:07,705 --> 00:26:11,405
Speaker 6:  We were at The. Verge. Yeah. Right. And that's like years later. And that,

443
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:15,285
Speaker 6:  that was the turn like just fully the turn into, okay

444
00:26:15,465 --> 00:26:18,765
Speaker 6:  now these devices have their own content and Netflix knew it. This, the movie

445
00:26:18,765 --> 00:26:22,685
Speaker 6:  studios did not want to give them the content the TV studios did, which is

446
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:25,085
Speaker 6:  how you end up with the office in Suits and all this other stuff happening.

447
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:28,405
Speaker 6:  But that, that was the thing they were missing and eventually they just spent

448
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:31,045
Speaker 6:  the money to figure it out by owning it directly. Alright,

449
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:33,485
Speaker 2:  A couple more questions then we'll get outta here. Could you reboot this

450
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:37,245
Speaker 2:  in 2024? I think the answer's no. I think like a Netflix specific thing

451
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:39,685
Speaker 2:  has no place in 2024.

452
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:43,725
Speaker 5:  What if it's like an as an add-on for the Apple TV and all the other

453
00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:47,165
Speaker 5:  ones where Netflix refuses to to have its continued watching

454
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:48,405
Speaker 5:  in their apps.

455
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,605
Speaker 2:  Oh that's interesting. I mean but like is it, is there something to I want

456
00:26:52,605 --> 00:26:55,885
Speaker 2:  to turn on my TV and the very first thing that appears is just Netflix. Like

457
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:58,645
Speaker 2:  skip the home screen, do all just give me Netflix. I kind of think no,

458
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:02,605
Speaker 5:  No. Yeah, I think we're past that point. That would've been great in 2020

459
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:05,725
Speaker 5:  or 2019. But 2024, nobody wants that.

460
00:27:06,315 --> 00:27:09,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's kind of where I land too. Neela, what do you think?

461
00:27:09,465 --> 00:27:11,805
Speaker 6:  The constant ecosystem is just too fragmented.

462
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:14,525
Speaker 2:  That's what I think too. Would this thing have been a bigger hit if Apple

463
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:16,845
Speaker 2:  had made it Is is the next question. No,

464
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:19,365
Speaker 5:  'cause they did and it wasn't a hit. No. But

465
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:22,165
Speaker 2:  If Apple, apple had made this thing, I don't mean Apple had made its own

466
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:22,405
Speaker 2:  version of

467
00:27:22,825 --> 00:27:24,685
Speaker 6:  Had like a marketed this thing. Take

468
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,685
Speaker 2:  The Roku player and put Apple's name in front of it. Would it have been a

469
00:27:27,685 --> 00:27:28,045
Speaker 2:  bigger hit?

470
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:28,445
Speaker 5:  Yes,

471
00:27:28,965 --> 00:27:32,765
Speaker 2:  I think so too. This is 2008. Apple is coming off the iPhone. Things are

472
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:34,165
Speaker 2:  starting to happen. I think this thing would've been bigger.

473
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:37,885
Speaker 6:  Wait, how do like this specific device, no way.

474
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:39,885
Speaker 6:  No P like Apple would've

475
00:27:39,885 --> 00:27:42,205
Speaker 2:  The Apple Netflix player would've been a hit. I absolutely think so.

476
00:27:42,545 --> 00:27:46,445
Speaker 6:  The Steve Jobs Apple does not release this device as evidenced by the

477
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:47,565
Speaker 6:  fact that they did not.

478
00:27:47,785 --> 00:27:51,605
Speaker 2:  In this world that I'm creating the Steve Jobs, apple releases this device.

479
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:55,165
Speaker 6:  Walt has told this story many times. O on this show, Walt Mossberg where

480
00:27:55,185 --> 00:27:59,045
Speaker 6:  he was talking to Steve and Steve desperately wanted to build a

481
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:02,845
Speaker 6:  proper cable box and he went to the cable companies and said

482
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:06,565
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna build an actual cable box that it runs our software. It looks great,

483
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:10,245
Speaker 6:  the whole thing. And the cable company said here's our garbage middleware

484
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:13,845
Speaker 6:  software to authenticate to our cable network. So you have to put a cable

485
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:17,725
Speaker 6:  card in your box. And Steve Jobs said no. Like absolutely not. Like

486
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:21,685
Speaker 6:  I'm leaving this category behind and everyone will just hear my literal dying

487
00:28:21,775 --> 00:28:25,525
Speaker 6:  words. I finally cracked it haunting them for a generation

488
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:28,885
Speaker 6:  because TVs are garbage now and it was just 'cause he didn't want to use

489
00:28:28,985 --> 00:28:30,765
Speaker 6:  can s video port man.

490
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:32,685
Speaker 6:  No way.

491
00:28:33,475 --> 00:28:34,765
Speaker 2:  Okay, fair enough.

492
00:28:35,145 --> 00:28:39,085
Speaker 6:  And to be clear, they got all the way to the future of TV's apps with the

493
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:43,005
Speaker 6:  Apple TV and they have since walked that back by launching Apple

494
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:46,485
Speaker 6:  TV plus and doing the exact thing Netflix had to do, which was making their

495
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:47,845
Speaker 6:  own content to drive their own services.

496
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:51,005
Speaker 2:  Yep. A hundred percent agree. I also think it would've been a bigger hit

497
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:54,965
Speaker 2:  if Apple made it. So almost Crans. And last question

498
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:58,805
Speaker 2:  before we go, does, does the Roku Netflix player belong in the version

499
00:28:58,805 --> 00:28:59,645
Speaker 2:  History Hall of Fame?

500
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:00,605
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent.

501
00:29:01,145 --> 00:29:01,365
Speaker 6:  No.

502
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:03,285
Speaker 2:  Kranz I want, I wanna hear you first. Why?

503
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:07,765
Speaker 5:  Because I think what, what we've said here, this was, this was where the

504
00:29:07,765 --> 00:29:11,645
Speaker 5:  streaming box came from, right? This is where streaming kind of

505
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:15,405
Speaker 5:  like started to take off. This was that first big moment. I would argue that

506
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:17,285
Speaker 5:  the next Roku was the actual moment.

507
00:29:17,745 --> 00:29:18,925
Speaker 6:  See that's the one I'd put in the Hall

508
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:21,405
Speaker 5:  Of Fame. That's the one you'd put in the Hall of Fame. I just think this

509
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:25,205
Speaker 5:  one is so important because we wouldn't have that next Roku without it. It's

510
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:25,885
Speaker 5:  tricky. It's tricky.

511
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:29,365
Speaker 2:  Neli is your argument. It's not this one. It's the next one. Yeah, it's

512
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:32,685
Speaker 6:  The first one that that people started buying, right?

513
00:29:33,285 --> 00:29:35,525
Speaker 2:  I mean that's that's real. This one was not a huge hit

514
00:29:35,665 --> 00:29:39,045
Speaker 6:  It. It was like the opposite. It was like a, I don't know, it was like a

515
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:42,205
Speaker 6:  sketch. It was like they sold a prototype and they realized they had a good

516
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:45,885
Speaker 6:  idea and then they finished the idea and that's the one that like actually

517
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:48,885
Speaker 6:  changed the industry 'cause it moved the way consumer demand was going.

518
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:52,445
Speaker 2:  Okay. All right, well we will, we will rehab this debate when we do that

519
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:55,245
Speaker 2:  one because that'll be a fun episode too. But for now I think it stays out

520
00:29:55,245 --> 00:29:57,525
Speaker 2:  of the Hall of Fame. Okay. Also because this is the first time we've ever

521
00:29:57,525 --> 00:30:00,325
Speaker 2:  done it. If we put the first thing in the hall of Fame, it just feels like

522
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:01,805
Speaker 2:  we're on a bad path. Yeah. Yeah.

523
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:05,005
Speaker 5:  And it just, everything's entering the Hall of Fame. Yeah, it's

524
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:05,205
Speaker 2:  No good.

525
00:30:05,205 --> 00:30:08,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's like are you gonna put Windows Media Center in the hall? No.

526
00:30:09,545 --> 00:30:09,765
Speaker 6:  No.

527
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:13,805
Speaker 2:  Probably not. No. But Microsoft Silver Light. Yes.

528
00:30:14,065 --> 00:30:17,445
Speaker 6:  By the way, Microsoft took the deal from the cable companies and shipped

529
00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:21,125
Speaker 6:  Windows PCs with cable card slots in them. Yep. Nightmare. An

530
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:24,085
Speaker 6:  actual, I think the headline in Eng Gadget was Nightmare

531
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:29,365
Speaker 2:  Feels right. All right, thank you both for going on this

532
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:49,645
Speaker 2:  I would say one of the things we feel more aggressively

533
00:32:49,645 --> 00:32:53,485
Speaker 2:  contested about right now, which is the software in your

534
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:57,165
Speaker 2:  car. This is the is CarPlay of the future or is it a

535
00:32:57,165 --> 00:32:58,925
Speaker 2:  nightmare debate? Here we go.

536
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:05,925
Speaker 7:  Good day. I'm Liam James moderator for today's debate and my job is to

537
00:33:05,925 --> 00:33:09,365
Speaker 7:  facilitate a debate between today's hosts on the topic of

538
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:13,005
Speaker 7:  automotive infotainment systems like CarPlay and Android Auto. Today we have

539
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:16,325
Speaker 7:  editor in Chief Neli Patel. Welcome Eli. Hello

540
00:33:16,985 --> 00:33:20,045
Speaker 7:  and editor at large, David Pierce. David, welcome to the debate.

541
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:20,805
Speaker 2:  Thank you.

542
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:24,685
Speaker 7:  Alright, before we get started, I'd like to share the rules with our audience.

543
00:33:24,865 --> 00:33:28,365
Speaker 7:  So each person will make their case for The Verge cast audience. A virtual

544
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:29,645
Speaker 7:  coin toss will determine my

545
00:33:29,765 --> 00:33:30,525
Speaker 6:  Opponent is a communist.

546
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:34,685
Speaker 7:  A virtual coin toss will determine who goes first. We'll have opening

547
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:38,245
Speaker 7:  statements and following that, each host will be given two minutes to answer

548
00:33:38,265 --> 00:33:41,565
Speaker 7:  my questions with up to an optional one minute rebuttal from the opposing

549
00:33:41,635 --> 00:33:45,565
Speaker 7:  host. The questions were not shared in advance with either person. Our

550
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,605
Speaker 7:  hosts may use the internet to confirm factual details, but they use their

551
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:52,325
Speaker 7:  limited time while doing so. Okay, and with that, let's get to our topic

552
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:56,165
Speaker 7:  for today. All the way back in June, 2013, if You can remember that

553
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:59,925
Speaker 7:  far back, apple introduced CarPlay. Actually they called it iOS in the

554
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:03,605
Speaker 7:  car, if I remember correctly. Originally it was a standard that

555
00:34:03,605 --> 00:34:07,525
Speaker 7:  enabled in dash head units in cars to display and control

556
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:11,805
Speaker 7:  a more modern smartphone like interface. Not long after Andrew introduced

557
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:15,685
Speaker 7:  their own standard with similar capabilities, but a lot has changed since

558
00:34:15,685 --> 00:34:19,245
Speaker 7:  then. In mid 2024 we asked the question,

559
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:23,205
Speaker 7:  what is better for consumers? Is it CarPlay, Android Auto and similar

560
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:26,965
Speaker 7:  systems or should the automakers take back control and do this all

561
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:30,805
Speaker 7:  themselves? Alright, we are gonna start

562
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:34,645
Speaker 7:  off by doing a quick virtual coin toss. Technically you're the

563
00:34:34,765 --> 00:34:37,725
Speaker 7:  visiting team, Eli, so you get to pick heads or tails.

564
00:34:38,295 --> 00:34:39,205
Speaker 6:  Tails never fails.

565
00:34:39,665 --> 00:34:39,965
Speaker 7:  All right.

566
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:45,645
Speaker 7:  and it is tails. So Eli would, would you like to go first or would

567
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:49,245
Speaker 7:  you like to go last with your closing

568
00:34:49,245 --> 00:34:49,725
Speaker 7:  statements?

569
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:51,405
Speaker 6:  I'd like to go last.

570
00:34:51,975 --> 00:34:53,925
Speaker 7:  You'd like to go last and

571
00:34:54,035 --> 00:34:57,085
Speaker 2:  It's a real defer to the second half move. It's a good, it's the right call.

572
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:58,245
Speaker 2:  It's the right call. Yeah.

573
00:34:58,245 --> 00:34:59,605
Speaker 6:  Defense wins championships David.

574
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:04,205
Speaker 7:  Okay great. It will be no surprise to our audience that Eli will be arguing

575
00:35:04,295 --> 00:35:08,205
Speaker 7:  today for the car makers and David will be arguing for

576
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:11,925
Speaker 7:  CarPlay and Android Auto. Alright, let's get started with opening

577
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:15,165
Speaker 7:  statements. David, you're up first. You have up to two minutes.

578
00:35:15,705 --> 00:35:19,645
Speaker 2:  My argument is very simple, which is that it's not that you

579
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:23,405
Speaker 2:  couldn't have very good software built by car makers.

580
00:35:23,515 --> 00:35:27,045
Speaker 2:  It's that you won't, it's that it doesn't exist. It has never existed and

581
00:35:27,045 --> 00:35:30,445
Speaker 2:  it will never exist. By bringing your phone into the car,

582
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:34,365
Speaker 2:  what you get is an interface. You understand, you get the apps you already

583
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:38,125
Speaker 2:  have, you get the data that already exists on your device. You

584
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:41,845
Speaker 2:  don't have to rely on a bunch of car companies who have made decades worth

585
00:35:41,845 --> 00:35:45,685
Speaker 2:  of awful software and now are trying to charge you more subscriptions. They're

586
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,165
Speaker 2:  trying to sell your data, they're trying to own more of the experience largely

587
00:35:49,255 --> 00:35:52,925
Speaker 2:  based on software stacks that some company including those car companies,

588
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:56,605
Speaker 2:  is not going to keep caring about. I am in control when I use

589
00:35:56,605 --> 00:36:00,485
Speaker 2:  CarPlay, I get to plug the thing in or pair it over Bluetooth, it

590
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:04,405
Speaker 2:  just works. It is my music app, it's my podcast app. I can use whatever I

591
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:08,285
Speaker 2:  want for navigation. Not whether somebody signed a deal with Waze

592
00:36:08,305 --> 00:36:11,885
Speaker 2:  or here or whoever. It's my phone and the car

593
00:36:11,985 --> 00:36:15,325
Speaker 2:  should do car things. The car should keep me alive and get me where I'm going

594
00:36:15,665 --> 00:36:19,325
Speaker 2:  and everything else should be somebody else's problem. And there is precisely

595
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:23,165
Speaker 2:  zero evidence to show that car makers can build good software,

596
00:36:23,165 --> 00:36:26,485
Speaker 2:  including the car makers. Everybody says build good software, do not build

597
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:29,965
Speaker 2:  good software, they build good car software. So my thing is, let's let software

598
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:33,525
Speaker 2:  companies be software companies and let car companies be car companies and

599
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,845
Speaker 2:  everybody can win and it's just that simple.

600
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:38,365
Speaker 7:  And Neli Patel, your opening statement,

601
00:36:39,025 --> 00:36:42,605
Speaker 6:  My fellow Americans, I come before you with two arguments. Well three,

602
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:46,805
Speaker 6:  first David is a communist. That's important and we should not agree to his

603
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:50,725
Speaker 6:  radical communist agenda. Second, no matter what

604
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:53,765
Speaker 6:  I why if as long as I've made that point clear, I think that's important.

605
00:36:54,385 --> 00:36:58,165
Speaker 6:  Two, I'm not arguing that car makers are good, I'm arguing

606
00:36:58,395 --> 00:37:02,125
Speaker 6:  that CarPlay in particular is bad. CarPlay has not meaningfully

607
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:06,045
Speaker 6:  changed in a decade. You can't do something as simple as

608
00:37:06,715 --> 00:37:10,685
Speaker 6:  look at a list of songs while looking at the map in CarPlay. You

609
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:14,405
Speaker 6:  just can't do it. The idea that Apple will somehow get good at

610
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:18,205
Speaker 6:  showing you two applications at once on an iOS device is a pipe dream that

611
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:21,485
Speaker 6:  we've seen fail over and over again with the iPad for a decade now

612
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:25,365
Speaker 6:  they're just not gonna do it. Your opportunity for CarPlay is limited

613
00:37:25,585 --> 00:37:29,445
Speaker 6:  and that's fine if like communist David here. You think

614
00:37:29,785 --> 00:37:33,605
Speaker 6:  the state should limit you to one application at a time in your car. My

615
00:37:33,605 --> 00:37:37,085
Speaker 6:  second point is that cars are getting ever more complicated and the idea

616
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:40,645
Speaker 6:  is that cars are not a software experience. It is silly.

617
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,245
Speaker 6:  I'm not saying they're good at the software now. Even your Teslas, your rivian,

618
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:48,165
Speaker 6:  I've, I've been test driving Rivian for three days now. It's not great.

619
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:52,285
Speaker 6:  I'm not pretending it's great, but things like charging your ev,

620
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:55,565
Speaker 6:  managing your range, knowing where all the nearby chargers are

621
00:37:56,925 --> 00:38:00,525
Speaker 6:  combined with autonomous driving, setting a destination on the map and letting

622
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:04,165
Speaker 6:  the car help you get there. All stuff the car is gonna do more

623
00:38:04,345 --> 00:38:08,205
Speaker 6:  and more of. And if you're an Apple fan, you know that integrated

624
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:11,965
Speaker 6:  solutions are better than the weird Bluetooth fragmentation that

625
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:15,925
Speaker 6:  David and his Comey brethren would foist upon you be a

626
00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:19,645
Speaker 6:  true American. Let GM put Android in your car. Vote

627
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:20,045
Speaker 6:  Patel.

628
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,805
Speaker 7:  That was fantastic. Okay, with those opening statements,

629
00:38:24,615 --> 00:38:28,085
Speaker 7:  we'll move on to our first question, which is gonna be for David Pierce.

630
00:38:28,615 --> 00:38:28,965
Speaker 2:  Hello

631
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:32,885
Speaker 7:  David. Driving compete considered one of the more dangerous

632
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:36,205
Speaker 7:  activities we complete in our daily lives. Many people

633
00:38:36,845 --> 00:38:40,525
Speaker 7:  consider the CarPlay and Android auto interfaces to be

634
00:38:40,595 --> 00:38:44,285
Speaker 7:  less tactile and more specifically the removal of

635
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:48,165
Speaker 7:  buttons inside of modern cars has caused a lot

636
00:38:48,165 --> 00:38:52,045
Speaker 7:  of consternation on the side of older

637
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:56,005
Speaker 7:  drivers. What do you say to the people that want

638
00:38:56,425 --> 00:39:00,205
Speaker 7:  all the important safety interfaces, things

639
00:39:00,235 --> 00:39:03,925
Speaker 7:  like windshield wipers, climate control for

640
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:07,645
Speaker 7:  fogged up windows, things that you need to be able to

641
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:12,085
Speaker 7:  quickly turn on and off in the car being relegated to

642
00:39:12,205 --> 00:39:13,605
Speaker 7:  touchscreen interfaces?

643
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:18,285
Speaker 2:  I have two points to make and and Liam, thank you for asking that. Very good

644
00:39:18,485 --> 00:39:18,565
Speaker 2:  question.

645
00:39:19,575 --> 00:39:19,925
Speaker 6:  Point

646
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:23,205
Speaker 2:  Number one, this is, this is a bad trend. You

647
00:39:23,205 --> 00:39:26,405
Speaker 7:  Always know the person's not sure what they're gonna say yet when they compliment

648
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,805
Speaker 7:  the moderator's question. I'm

649
00:39:27,805 --> 00:39:31,645
Speaker 2:  Sorry, I'm reclaiming my time from the moderator. This, this

650
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:35,485
Speaker 2:  trend is wrong. I, I am pro buttons, we are pro buttons here on The.

651
00:39:35,525 --> 00:39:39,405
Speaker 2:  Vergecast buttons are good. We should have more dedicated controls for

652
00:39:39,405 --> 00:39:43,245
Speaker 2:  doing things. That is not the trend that we are on. And neither Apple

653
00:39:43,305 --> 00:39:47,005
Speaker 2:  nor Google caused that trend. This this trend towards touch

654
00:39:47,005 --> 00:39:50,925
Speaker 2:  interfaces for everything in cars is I believe a bad idea. But

655
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:54,685
Speaker 2:  it is the one that we are on. And so what I'm arguing is that rather than

656
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:58,645
Speaker 2:  present you with a giant set of brand new controls, every time

657
00:39:58,645 --> 00:40:02,165
Speaker 2:  you get into a vehicle or onto a scooter or

658
00:40:02,885 --> 00:40:06,565
Speaker 2:  anything, that you should have a system that you understand and that I am

659
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:10,245
Speaker 2:  now bringing this thing with me instead of basically just being tossed

660
00:40:10,395 --> 00:40:14,285
Speaker 2:  into the deep end of somebody's bad software design every single time

661
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:17,685
Speaker 2:  I sit down in front of the steering wheel, would I like to completely change

662
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:20,765
Speaker 2:  the car industry such that none of this was important and that there was

663
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:23,885
Speaker 2:  a button that I could just roll the windows down with and I didn't have to

664
00:40:23,885 --> 00:40:27,325
Speaker 2:  guess how to open the handles to get in the freaking car? Yes, of course,

665
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:31,685
Speaker 2:  but that is not where we are. And so what matters more than ever actually

666
00:40:32,225 --> 00:40:36,125
Speaker 2:  is consistency and having some cross car

667
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:40,045
Speaker 2:  understanding of where things are and how they work. And there is no better

668
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:41,845
Speaker 2:  system for that than CarPlay and Android Auto.

669
00:40:42,385 --> 00:40:45,725
Speaker 7:  Wow, that was exactly two minutes Neli. Would you like to rebut that

670
00:40:45,905 --> 00:40:47,365
Speaker 6:  Spoken like a true communist?

671
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,765
Speaker 2:  Is there a penalty for ad ho and of attacks on

672
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:54,165
Speaker 6:  This? David would have you turn away from the freedom

673
00:40:54,545 --> 00:40:58,205
Speaker 6:  and innovation and liberty of the market to put

674
00:40:58,385 --> 00:41:02,085
Speaker 6:  insane door handles on vehicles and instead have

675
00:41:02,185 --> 00:41:05,565
Speaker 6:  Tim Cook impose a draconian system

676
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:10,045
Speaker 6:  of weird sliders and that gray scale that they do that

677
00:41:10,045 --> 00:41:12,765
Speaker 6:  doesn't look good even on an OLED display. You know what I'm talking about?

678
00:41:13,235 --> 00:41:16,205
Speaker 6:  It's just not good. It just doesn't look good. As Americans, we should have

679
00:41:16,205 --> 00:41:20,005
Speaker 6:  the freedom to have cars that look cool and operate the windshield wipers

680
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:24,005
Speaker 6:  in evermore esoteric ways. Automatic. You say nay, I

681
00:41:24,005 --> 00:41:25,765
Speaker 6:  will push whatever button I choose to push.

682
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:29,565
Speaker 2:  Am I a car socialist? I think I might be a car socialist. I never thought

683
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:30,325
Speaker 2:  about this. David

684
00:41:30,335 --> 00:41:33,765
Speaker 6:  Hates liberty. He wants everyone to drive one of those weird Russian cars

685
00:41:33,765 --> 00:41:36,885
Speaker 6:  with a bubble windshields and all the controls are exactly the same and you

686
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:40,805
Speaker 6:  know how to use them because you've been given a car by dictator

687
00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:43,965
Speaker 6:  Pierce over here. I'm saying gentlemen, gentlemen, what's more American?

688
00:41:43,975 --> 00:41:47,525
Speaker 6:  Let's, let's keep the red to the open road with a variety of buttons and

689
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:47,885
Speaker 6:  knobs.

690
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:51,925
Speaker 7:  Let's keep the rhetoric down gentlemen, moving on to our next

691
00:41:52,165 --> 00:41:53,005
Speaker 7:  question. Yeah,

692
00:41:53,005 --> 00:41:56,245
Speaker 2:  Let's just move the gas pedal. Who even cares? Do whatever you want. It doesn't

693
00:41:56,245 --> 00:41:58,325
Speaker 2:  even matter. Cars are fine. What's the worst that could happen?

694
00:41:58,345 --> 00:41:59,405
Speaker 6:  That's free market baby.

695
00:41:59,795 --> 00:42:03,325
Speaker 7:  Next question is for you Eli. Eli, you mentioned in your opening statement

696
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:07,525
Speaker 7:  the problem of having many more capabilities

697
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:11,565
Speaker 7:  and cars and the inability to show

698
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:15,325
Speaker 7:  those in ways that allows for multitasking or multi window

699
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:19,125
Speaker 7:  interfaces to make this both easier and safer to use.

700
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:23,485
Speaker 7:  What makes you think automakers are the right people to fix that problem?

701
00:42:24,095 --> 00:42:27,965
Speaker 6:  Again, let me be clear. I'm arguing mostly that CarPlay is bad. I

702
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:31,165
Speaker 6:  don't think that car makers are the best people to solve this problem.

703
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:36,045
Speaker 6:  In fact, I think they might be some of the worst. But no one will

704
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:40,165
Speaker 6:  try to solve the problem if we just give everything to one company.

705
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:44,205
Speaker 6:  If we just hand over our interfaces to one company with no incentive to do

706
00:42:44,325 --> 00:42:47,725
Speaker 6:  anything other than to get you to buy another iPhone or to sign up for one

707
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:51,125
Speaker 6:  of their their various services. You wanna buy a new car that comes with

708
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:55,085
Speaker 6:  three months of free Apple TV plus be, be my guest, let let It

709
00:42:55,085 --> 00:42:58,965
Speaker 6:  Ride. I'm just saying you will never get new ideas in this market

710
00:42:59,385 --> 00:43:03,325
Speaker 6:  if you give up. And David would have us give up to live in his

711
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:05,925
Speaker 6:  top down government controlled

712
00:43:06,205 --> 00:43:08,925
Speaker 2:  Emphasis on live as in remain alive.

713
00:43:11,065 --> 00:43:14,205
Speaker 6:  I'm just saying what we're gonna be in a, we're we're headed towards a future

714
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:18,645
Speaker 6:  where I believe people would like to both look at the

715
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:22,645
Speaker 6:  map and pick the next song without having to literally switch

716
00:43:22,675 --> 00:43:26,045
Speaker 6:  apps because the car will be doing more of the work itself.

717
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:30,485
Speaker 6:  I don't see a pathway from the CarPlay we have today to that future

718
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:33,885
Speaker 6:  and I see no indication that Apple's interested in that. I also see a future

719
00:43:33,985 --> 00:43:37,565
Speaker 6:  in which there are more screens in the cars, there are more screens in the

720
00:43:37,565 --> 00:43:41,165
Speaker 6:  car where passengers are doing more things on the screens in the car and

721
00:43:41,165 --> 00:43:44,725
Speaker 6:  having that all tied to one phone seems a little bonkers.

722
00:43:45,325 --> 00:43:49,045
Speaker 6:  I think you want your car to be as integrated and as functional as

723
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:53,205
Speaker 6:  your smartphone. And I think it's on car makers to get there. I'm not

724
00:43:53,205 --> 00:43:56,525
Speaker 6:  saying I'm gonna get there now, but I'm saying I I don't wanna live in David's

725
00:43:56,775 --> 00:43:58,365
Speaker 6:  weird dystopian nightmare future.

726
00:43:59,025 --> 00:44:02,765
Speaker 2:  The weird dystopian nightmare future you're describing is one in which you

727
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,725
Speaker 2:  know how to use your car. Is that, is that what we're talking about here?

728
00:44:06,565 --> 00:44:10,325
Speaker 2:  I I am pro competition. I believe in the idea that

729
00:44:10,345 --> 00:44:14,285
Speaker 2:  we can have lots of different options here. I don't think a world in which

730
00:44:14,395 --> 00:44:18,325
Speaker 2:  CarPlay is the only interface that exists is the, the

731
00:44:18,495 --> 00:44:22,485
Speaker 2:  ideal outcome. I'm just saying it's better than a

732
00:44:22,485 --> 00:44:25,925
Speaker 2:  world in which I am getting into a car and just

733
00:44:26,075 --> 00:44:30,005
Speaker 2:  banking on GM to have finally for the first time in its

734
00:44:30,005 --> 00:44:33,925
Speaker 2:  history, built good software. I would point you to gm, a company that very

735
00:44:33,925 --> 00:44:36,965
Speaker 2:  famously broke up with Android Auto and CarPlay has had

736
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:41,365
Speaker 2:  disastrous consequences, had to stop selling the first car on

737
00:44:41,365 --> 00:44:45,245
Speaker 2:  which it made its own software because its software was so bad. This

738
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:48,245
Speaker 2:  is what we're up against. I'm not arguing CarPlay is the solution to all

739
00:44:48,245 --> 00:44:50,405
Speaker 2:  of our problems. I'm just arguing it's better than that.

740
00:44:50,885 --> 00:44:52,245
Speaker 6:  Realtime fact checks, sir

741
00:44:52,475 --> 00:44:55,525
Speaker 7:  Neli is not your turn. Realtime fact. You'll have a chance to respond with

742
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:56,045
Speaker 7:  your next question.

743
00:44:56,185 --> 00:44:58,845
Speaker 2:  No. Yeah, listen, NELI, the move is just talk over the moderator. We've,

744
00:44:58,845 --> 00:44:59,885
Speaker 2:  we've been through this before. Come on.

745
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:06,005
Speaker 6:  I feel like all of us have learned some very bad lessons along the way here.

746
00:45:06,385 --> 00:45:09,685
Speaker 2:  Please, I welcome your realtime fact checks sir. Alright.

747
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:13,965
Speaker 6:  Again, no one's saying that GM is good at software. It wasn't the move away

748
00:45:13,965 --> 00:45:17,645
Speaker 6:  from Android Auto that caused the blazer to get recalled and and have the

749
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:20,045
Speaker 6:  stop sell. That was their bad battery software. It's

750
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:21,925
Speaker 2:  GM's general software in aptitude.

751
00:45:22,225 --> 00:45:25,805
Speaker 6:  I'm just, it's different software. The the Escalades are moving, people are

752
00:45:25,805 --> 00:45:29,565
Speaker 6:  buying Escalades, people are buying the cars that don't have the stuff, but

753
00:45:29,565 --> 00:45:32,485
Speaker 6:  what they're enjoying about it is they get in the car and it already has

754
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:35,565
Speaker 6:  a Spotify app and it already has Google Maps, which are the only things people

755
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:35,845
Speaker 6:  want

756
00:45:35,905 --> 00:45:38,605
Speaker 2:  And are completely duplicative of the apps that they already have on their

757
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:38,765
Speaker 2:  phone.

758
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:41,725
Speaker 7:  Gentlemen, we need to move on. The next question is for you David Pierce.

759
00:45:42,195 --> 00:45:46,125
Speaker 7:  Long before options like CarPlay and Android Auto came

760
00:45:46,145 --> 00:45:49,685
Speaker 7:  out, we had problems with cell phones, in cars, text messaging,

761
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:53,965
Speaker 7:  distracting people, people talking on the phone, lots of things

762
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:57,565
Speaker 7:  went in place to try to regulate that hands-free options and stuff like this.

763
00:45:57,865 --> 00:46:00,725
Speaker 7:  Are you really saying that people should have apps in their cars? Should

764
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:04,365
Speaker 7:  they be playing with Spotify and Apple Music and all of these

765
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:06,685
Speaker 7:  interfaces when they're driving a car?

766
00:46:07,525 --> 00:46:11,365
Speaker 2:  I would encourage you to spend one minute watching people drive

767
00:46:11,365 --> 00:46:14,965
Speaker 2:  their cars. Everyone is looking at their phone all of the time.

768
00:46:15,585 --> 00:46:19,165
Speaker 2:  And again, would it be great if some of the systems that these companies

769
00:46:19,165 --> 00:46:22,445
Speaker 2:  had tried to implement had worked? If there, if the things like the driving

770
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:26,285
Speaker 2:  modes and the auto text response that says driving call you back later. Have

771
00:46:26,285 --> 00:46:29,125
Speaker 2:  you ever gotten one of those texts? No one's ever gotten one of those texts.

772
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:32,325
Speaker 2:  Those aren't a thing. The good news is because

773
00:46:32,905 --> 00:46:36,885
Speaker 2:  as my ridiculous opponent said in the first correct thing he said this

774
00:46:36,885 --> 00:46:40,605
Speaker 2:  entire time people do just want a couple of apps. Maybe it's

775
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:44,685
Speaker 2:  Google Maps and Spotify, maybe it's Apple Maps and Apple Music. What

776
00:46:44,725 --> 00:46:48,485
Speaker 2:  I gain by bringing my own device is I get to use the apps that I

777
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:52,285
Speaker 2:  want. I'm not forced into someone else's lockdown system

778
00:46:52,285 --> 00:46:55,805
Speaker 2:  that will inevitably be an old version of Android running old apps and not

779
00:46:55,805 --> 00:46:59,645
Speaker 2:  running very many apps. I get to have the stuff that I want.

780
00:46:59,705 --> 00:47:03,365
Speaker 2:  So the best case that I have for safety is to push that stuff

781
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:07,365
Speaker 2:  to the large display in front of me instead of requiring me to constantly

782
00:47:07,365 --> 00:47:11,205
Speaker 2:  look down at my phone. So actually every single app that I'm adding to one

783
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:13,885
Speaker 2:  of these two app stores through which I can actually get the things that

784
00:47:13,885 --> 00:47:17,685
Speaker 2:  I care about is an improvement. It's not going to solve everything because

785
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:20,685
Speaker 2:  everybody is still going to look at their phone, but it's better

786
00:47:21,265 --> 00:47:23,205
Speaker 6:  My friend. How popular is CarPlay?

787
00:47:23,435 --> 00:47:24,365
Speaker 2:  Extremely popular.

788
00:47:24,815 --> 00:47:27,605
Speaker 6:  Every everyone has it, right? It's everywhere. Yeah. Do you know why people

789
00:47:27,605 --> 00:47:30,605
Speaker 6:  are still looking at their phones in their cars? 'cause CarPlay sucks.

790
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:34,605
Speaker 6:  That's why 'cause you can't do the things that the people wanna do. So they

791
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:38,525
Speaker 6:  pick up their phones anyway, making driving. According to

792
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:42,125
Speaker 6:  the latest statistics I've seen 5000% more dangerous

793
00:47:42,855 --> 00:47:43,885
Speaker 2:  Based on the numbers. That's

794
00:47:43,885 --> 00:47:47,685
Speaker 6:  The America David Pierce wants you to live, right? You can look at my

795
00:47:47,685 --> 00:47:51,445
Speaker 6:  website, Neil Patel for CarPlay president.com and please donate.

796
00:47:52,105 --> 00:47:55,525
Speaker 6:  All I'm saying is if CarPlay was good, you would not see people

797
00:47:55,575 --> 00:47:58,285
Speaker 6:  constantly using their phones in their cars. And

798
00:47:58,285 --> 00:48:01,245
Speaker 2:  If car makers could make good software, people wouldn't be using CarPlay.

799
00:48:01,385 --> 00:48:04,925
Speaker 6:  No. 'cause you're plugging in your phone or worse, you're on wireless

800
00:48:04,955 --> 00:48:08,885
Speaker 6:  CarPlay, which has brought down the rate of new car satisfaction

801
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:12,645
Speaker 6:  because it's so flaky Over the past three years, you've taken

802
00:48:12,885 --> 00:48:16,645
Speaker 6:  a big real estate of the big screen and you've turned it into a single

803
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:20,405
Speaker 6:  unit tasking, limited application model. And then people use their phones

804
00:48:20,405 --> 00:48:23,965
Speaker 6:  anyway. Why not allow that screen to do

805
00:48:24,365 --> 00:48:25,205
Speaker 6:  multiple things at once?

806
00:48:25,955 --> 00:48:28,925
Speaker 7:  Neli, what makes you think car makers can do this at all?

807
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:32,845
Speaker 6:  Two, two things. One, they're trying, which is interesting.

808
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:37,485
Speaker 6:  You don't see a lot of trying in technology these days. And second, there

809
00:48:37,485 --> 00:48:41,405
Speaker 6:  are some results that show that how we build and design cars is changing.

810
00:48:42,025 --> 00:48:46,005
Speaker 6:  So Tesla's way ahead here, they've reduced the number of computers in their

811
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:49,365
Speaker 6:  cars over the years to almost nothing at this point.

812
00:48:49,925 --> 00:48:53,645
Speaker 6:  And that's Tesla. Great. They've also reduced the number of curved surfaces

813
00:48:53,645 --> 00:48:57,085
Speaker 6:  on their trucks to zero. And then you look at Rivian, which just updated

814
00:48:57,085 --> 00:49:00,805
Speaker 6:  the R one platform to something they're calling the zonal architecture. They're

815
00:49:01,245 --> 00:49:05,085
Speaker 6:  combining the multiple sensor arrays and

816
00:49:05,185 --> 00:49:08,925
Speaker 6:  microprocessors and controllers and sys and and integrated

817
00:49:08,925 --> 00:49:12,885
Speaker 6:  systems on their cars into big computers in zones

818
00:49:12,885 --> 00:49:16,605
Speaker 6:  of the car that control various functions. That's a big deal. That's literally

819
00:49:16,645 --> 00:49:20,485
Speaker 6:  a rethink of how cars are designed, how they operate, all

820
00:49:20,485 --> 00:49:23,805
Speaker 6:  the functions of a car, all the bits and bobs or rivian that can be controlled

821
00:49:23,945 --> 00:49:27,645
Speaker 6:  not only from the touchscreen but remotely requires the car to have a

822
00:49:27,645 --> 00:49:31,245
Speaker 6:  computing architecture that can do all this stuff. Then You can put an interface

823
00:49:31,245 --> 00:49:34,205
Speaker 6:  on top of that. Maybe that interface is CarPlay, but you need to do that

824
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:37,845
Speaker 6:  work. The hardcore computer design integration work

825
00:49:37,845 --> 00:49:41,685
Speaker 6:  across the car to even have the opportunity to do something

826
00:49:41,685 --> 00:49:45,365
Speaker 6:  like introduce cool new features over

827
00:49:45,395 --> 00:49:48,605
Speaker 6:  with over the air updates. You just have to design the car differently. All

828
00:49:48,605 --> 00:49:52,005
Speaker 6:  the car makers wanna do this so they have the desire and then there's competition

829
00:49:52,005 --> 00:49:55,405
Speaker 6:  in the market that's pushing them to deliver And. if you just give up the

830
00:49:55,405 --> 00:49:59,045
Speaker 6:  screen to Apple and say, look, this car is here to get you from point A to

831
00:49:59,045 --> 00:50:02,805
Speaker 6:  point B, I believe the world will turn gray. Much

832
00:50:02,805 --> 00:50:06,245
Speaker 6:  like the Soviet Union. Have you ever seen the hunt for red October? It's

833
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:06,405
Speaker 6:  one of

834
00:50:06,405 --> 00:50:06,885
Speaker 7:  My favorite movies.

835
00:50:07,385 --> 00:50:09,685
Speaker 2:  If they had CarPlay and submarines, it would've solved a lot of problems.

836
00:50:09,945 --> 00:50:10,365
Speaker 2:  I'm just saying,

837
00:50:10,695 --> 00:50:11,885
Speaker 7:  David, do you wanna respond to that?

838
00:50:12,285 --> 00:50:15,965
Speaker 2:  I do wanna respond. My response is that I agree that

839
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:20,085
Speaker 2:  car companies should be in charge of making their cars work. That's

840
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:23,045
Speaker 2:  not what we're debating here. That's not a complicated question and to the

841
00:50:23,045 --> 00:50:26,885
Speaker 2:  extent that making a car work is increasingly a job of building and

842
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:30,925
Speaker 2:  maintaining computers, sure learn how to do that. But

843
00:50:30,925 --> 00:50:34,885
Speaker 2:  it is just simply true that these companies have no track record

844
00:50:35,025 --> 00:50:38,485
Speaker 2:  and very little ability to build good, usable

845
00:50:39,085 --> 00:50:42,925
Speaker 2:  software for humans. Most of the time, most of what's happening in a

846
00:50:42,925 --> 00:50:46,645
Speaker 2:  car is abstracted away from the person who is using it and

847
00:50:46,645 --> 00:50:50,485
Speaker 2:  that's good. Most of it should not be your job to figure out

848
00:50:50,485 --> 00:50:53,565
Speaker 2:  all the time. If you had to pick which brake you applied every time you applied

849
00:50:53,565 --> 00:50:56,165
Speaker 2:  the brakes, bad things would happen. It's good that that's attracted away

850
00:50:56,165 --> 00:50:59,565
Speaker 2:  from you. The stuff that is not is the stuff that is in front of you. It's

851
00:50:59,565 --> 00:51:02,845
Speaker 2:  the navigation, it's the music, it's it's basic controls over the systems

852
00:51:02,865 --> 00:51:06,685
Speaker 2:  inside of your car. That stuff should be separate and you, the

853
00:51:06,915 --> 00:51:10,525
Speaker 2:  user, the driver, the passenger, whoever you are in the car, should be able

854
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:13,285
Speaker 2:  to control what that is and you should be able to bring it with you in a

855
00:51:13,285 --> 00:51:16,725
Speaker 2:  way that is consistent and is personalized. And is yours. Let the car companies

856
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:17,405
Speaker 2:  be car companies.

857
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,885
Speaker 7:  Okay. Go into closing statements. David, you're first.

858
00:51:27,595 --> 00:51:30,965
Speaker 2:  Okay, let me describe to you some things that I don't want.

859
00:51:31,965 --> 00:51:35,765
Speaker 2:  I don't want a car that I get in and cannot

860
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:39,445
Speaker 2:  make any sense of. no matter what. I don't want a car that doesn't have my

861
00:51:39,445 --> 00:51:43,165
Speaker 2:  apps. I don't want a car that has my apps but doesn't know anything

862
00:51:43,215 --> 00:51:47,085
Speaker 2:  about me like where I live or where my office

863
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:50,485
Speaker 2:  is or any of the places that I like to go. I think of

864
00:51:51,225 --> 00:51:54,925
Speaker 2:  car companies and tech companies as like sports owners. Like they're very

865
00:51:54,925 --> 00:51:56,885
Speaker 2:  good at business, they make a lot of money and then they go buy a sports

866
00:51:56,885 --> 00:52:00,685
Speaker 2:  team and they think because they knew how to run like a mortgage company,

867
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:03,845
Speaker 2:  they know how to run a sports team and they'll just do it the same way. Different

868
00:52:03,845 --> 00:52:07,805
Speaker 2:  things let different things be different things, and letting

869
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:11,685
Speaker 2:  someone build good infotainment software that humans are supposed to use

870
00:52:12,105 --> 00:52:16,005
Speaker 2:  is so radically different from what it takes to make a car work

871
00:52:16,005 --> 00:52:19,925
Speaker 2:  very well. I don't think the Apple car was a good idea. I kind of

872
00:52:19,925 --> 00:52:23,805
Speaker 2:  think Waymo is weird and way out over at skis and doing some

873
00:52:23,805 --> 00:52:27,285
Speaker 2:  crazy stuff like let let the tech companies do the tech things, let the car

874
00:52:27,605 --> 00:52:31,245
Speaker 2:  companies do the car things. I'm not interested in updating my

875
00:52:31,335 --> 00:52:34,645
Speaker 2:  car's software every time a new Spotify feature appears.

876
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:38,725
Speaker 2:  I am not interested in having to upgrade my car just because Google

877
00:52:38,915 --> 00:52:42,565
Speaker 2:  forgets about its Android automotive nonsense. In two years,

878
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:47,005
Speaker 2:  I want to be able to bring my technology to my car and I

879
00:52:47,005 --> 00:52:50,925
Speaker 2:  want my car to keep me alive. Those are two different jobs and I'm

880
00:52:50,925 --> 00:52:53,565
Speaker 2:  okay with them being different jobs. And Mr. Patel,

881
00:52:54,345 --> 00:52:57,885
Speaker 6:  My friend David Pierce, makes a impassioned

882
00:52:58,195 --> 00:53:02,005
Speaker 6:  case, but my friends, he's wrong because if you

883
00:53:02,005 --> 00:53:05,805
Speaker 6:  listen to him, you would believe that CarPlay is any

884
00:53:05,805 --> 00:53:09,725
Speaker 6:  good at all. It's not. It just isn't. Just look at it.

885
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:14,045
Speaker 6:  You don't have to believe me, you don't have to look at charts and

886
00:53:14,245 --> 00:53:18,165
Speaker 6:  graphs or go to my website, vote for patel car software.com

887
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:22,085
Speaker 6:  and leave a $20 donation. 95% of Americans have donated $20 or

888
00:53:22,085 --> 00:53:25,725
Speaker 6:  less. You don't have to do any of those things, but you should just look

889
00:53:25,725 --> 00:53:29,525
Speaker 6:  at it. Who are you gonna believe? David Pierce his slick

890
00:53:29,525 --> 00:53:31,405
Speaker 6:  tongue, his carpet bag.

891
00:53:32,955 --> 00:53:36,485
Speaker 6:  It's not good. It hasn't substantively changed in a decade.

892
00:53:37,115 --> 00:53:40,845
Speaker 6:  It's just the same list of things. I, like many

893
00:53:41,205 --> 00:53:45,045
Speaker 6:  Americans, most Americans, all Americans believe that the greatest

894
00:53:45,185 --> 00:53:48,925
Speaker 6:  joy in life is buying something expensive and then pushing all of the buttons

895
00:53:49,425 --> 00:53:53,285
Speaker 6:  in Pierce's, communist America, it, there's no more, there's

896
00:53:53,285 --> 00:53:56,405
Speaker 6:  none of that. You just get in the car and it's the same old dumb CarPlay

897
00:53:56,405 --> 00:54:00,245
Speaker 6:  that you've had for the past 10 years with nothing new on the menu. I

898
00:54:00,245 --> 00:54:03,685
Speaker 6:  don't wanna live in that America. I wanna live in America where

899
00:54:04,225 --> 00:54:08,165
Speaker 6:  God forbid some software designer at Ford has decided to move

900
00:54:08,185 --> 00:54:11,405
Speaker 6:  all the climate controls around and then you gotta figure it out and then

901
00:54:11,405 --> 00:54:15,325
Speaker 6:  you figured it out and you've won one tiny shred of

902
00:54:15,325 --> 00:54:18,805
Speaker 6:  victory in your life. Vote Patel.

903
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:23,605
Speaker 2:  I can see why you were a good lawyer. You just said nothing

904
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:27,485
Speaker 2:  and I'm like, yeah, 80% how you sound,

905
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:29,125
Speaker 6:  20% what you say.

906
00:54:29,515 --> 00:54:32,725
Speaker 2:  That was good. I I feel it. You're dead wrong. And CarPlay is,

907
00:54:33,345 --> 00:54:37,205
Speaker 2:  I'm not no one, no one thinks CarPlay is great. It's just that it's better.

908
00:54:37,785 --> 00:54:41,005
Speaker 2:  And I'm, I I live in a world where better is enough.

909
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:45,205
Speaker 6:  Here, here I'll, I'll I've, again, I've spent several days with the Rivian.

910
00:54:45,545 --> 00:54:49,205
Speaker 6:  The rivian maps are better. They're they're good, but the actual

911
00:54:49,355 --> 00:54:52,085
Speaker 6:  zooming when you drive around with the maps is so

912
00:56:44,405 --> 00:56:48,085
Speaker 3:  your fingertips. Expand your world with meta

913
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:48,605
Speaker 3:  ai.

914
00:57:39,605 --> 00:57:43,245
Speaker 8:  these lists? Of course there's just the regular spam stuff that I get,

915
00:57:43,785 --> 00:57:47,485
Speaker 8:  but it's completely taken over my messages app. I don't want to get a new

916
00:57:47,485 --> 00:57:51,165
Speaker 8:  phone number. I like my phone number. A lot of stuff's tied to it. Is there

917
00:57:51,325 --> 00:57:54,605
Speaker 8:  anything that I can do? I know getting on the do not call list doesn't help

918
00:57:54,835 --> 00:57:58,645
Speaker 8:  with political campaigns. Help me out here. Thanks lovely,

919
00:57:58,645 --> 00:57:58,925
Speaker 8:  Sean.

920
00:57:59,515 --> 00:58:03,485
Speaker 2:  Okay, so at least for people in the United States, this is a huge and

921
00:58:03,535 --> 00:58:07,165
Speaker 2:  widespread problem. I don't know how big a deal it is in other

922
00:58:07,405 --> 00:58:10,325
Speaker 2:  countries. I've heard a lot about folks getting political spam on WhatsApp

923
00:58:10,325 --> 00:58:13,045
Speaker 2:  and other places, but I just wanna talk about the US for right now because

924
00:58:13,045 --> 00:58:17,005
Speaker 2:  this in a funny way, is actually maybe more complicated in the

925
00:58:17,005 --> 00:58:20,485
Speaker 2:  United States than most places. And the unfortunate answer to the question

926
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:24,405
Speaker 2:  is there really isn't anything You can do, at least not

927
00:58:24,645 --> 00:58:28,245
Speaker 2:  anything that is kind of guaranteed to work in a sweeping Broadway.

928
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:32,125
Speaker 2:  So there's one kind of text that is from

929
00:58:32,325 --> 00:58:36,165
Speaker 2:  a legitimate business about legitimate business purposes, right? Those

930
00:58:36,165 --> 00:58:39,845
Speaker 2:  are the ones sometimes that you'll sign up for when you

931
00:58:40,185 --> 00:58:44,005
Speaker 2:  get a receipt from Square, right? You'll, you'll have signed up to get text

932
00:58:44,005 --> 00:58:47,605
Speaker 2:  messages and usually what those things will have is they'll say Stop to unsubscribe

933
00:58:47,785 --> 00:58:51,765
Speaker 2:  and typically you respond stop and it stops, right?

934
00:58:51,765 --> 00:58:54,605
Speaker 2:  Like that. That is actually a thing that these companies are legally required

935
00:58:54,705 --> 00:58:58,565
Speaker 2:  to do is stop. When you say stop and there are, there are

936
00:58:58,565 --> 00:59:02,285
Speaker 2:  systems that some carriers have to block that stuff like that

937
00:59:02,645 --> 00:59:06,485
Speaker 2:  actually works as a system when it is legitimate, when it's not

938
00:59:06,485 --> 00:59:10,365
Speaker 2:  legitimate. The problem with replying stop to a mass

939
00:59:10,395 --> 00:59:13,845
Speaker 2:  text message is actually what you've done is you've

940
00:59:13,845 --> 00:59:17,805
Speaker 2:  confirmed to whatever spammer is sending that spam text

941
00:59:17,995 --> 00:59:21,365
Speaker 2:  that your number is real and that someone is paying attention to it. And

942
00:59:21,365 --> 00:59:24,765
Speaker 2:  what that essentially gives them is license to keep spamming you. There's

943
00:59:24,765 --> 00:59:28,605
Speaker 2:  no technical reason that they have to stop if you say stop and

944
00:59:28,755 --> 00:59:32,685
Speaker 2:  they won't. So this is the risk that you're taking, right? If you get a political

945
00:59:32,685 --> 00:59:36,405
Speaker 2:  text, let's say from an actual campaign run by an actual

946
00:59:36,455 --> 00:59:40,285
Speaker 2:  above board organization and you reply stop, you'll stop getting it. All

947
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:44,085
Speaker 2:  it does is stop that one thing. And frankly, the honest

948
00:59:44,095 --> 00:59:47,965
Speaker 2:  truth is your phone number and my phone number have probably been sold

949
00:59:48,045 --> 00:59:51,165
Speaker 2:  a million times to a million different organizations. So you're forever playing

950
00:59:51,165 --> 00:59:54,165
Speaker 2:  this game of whack-a-Mole. There's no just like turn off the political text

951
00:59:54,165 --> 00:59:57,965
Speaker 2:  button that You can press, but You can do it one by one And. if you reply

952
00:59:58,115 --> 01:00:01,485
Speaker 2:  stop over and over and over again, the numbers will go down. That's been

953
01:00:01,485 --> 01:00:05,165
Speaker 2:  my experience every time I get one that is obviously from a campaign

954
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:08,805
Speaker 2:  and usually You can Google the number by the way and it will tell you pretty

955
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:12,445
Speaker 2:  reliably if it is a real number from a real campaign, if it is and you reply

956
01:00:12,445 --> 01:00:16,365
Speaker 2:  stop, it will go down again, Whack-a-Mole, but it'll work if you

957
01:00:16,665 --> 01:00:20,525
Speaker 2:  get it wrong and you reply to something that looks like a political

958
01:00:20,525 --> 01:00:23,965
Speaker 2:  text but is actually a spammer or a scammer of some kind,

959
01:00:24,295 --> 01:00:27,685
Speaker 2:  which is a thing that they do, especially in moments like this, you've just

960
01:00:27,685 --> 01:00:31,645
Speaker 2:  caused yourself extra problems. So really what you have to balance here

961
01:00:31,645 --> 01:00:34,845
Speaker 2:  is, okay, do I wanna do the work verifying every one of these numbers in

962
01:00:35,005 --> 01:00:38,805
Speaker 2:  order to go press the stop button, which just means

963
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:42,605
Speaker 2:  texting stop and make them go away? Or is it

964
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:46,445
Speaker 2:  less work to just frankly ignore the text messages? There are

965
01:00:46,445 --> 01:00:49,205
Speaker 2:  also a couple of things You can do other than replying. One thing You can

966
01:00:49,205 --> 01:00:52,605
Speaker 2:  do is delete it and report it to your carrier,

967
01:00:52,855 --> 01:00:56,485
Speaker 2:  which in theory will tune their systems for detecting spam.

968
01:00:56,985 --> 01:01:00,805
Speaker 2:  So that might make it better for everybody, but it also is, you know,

969
01:01:00,805 --> 01:01:04,405
Speaker 2:  manual labor. Every time you get one of these from a new number, you swipe

970
01:01:04,405 --> 01:01:08,125
Speaker 2:  and you hit delete and report junk and it goes to Verizon and whoever your

971
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:11,965
Speaker 2:  carrier is and that slowly makes things better, but

972
01:01:12,045 --> 01:01:15,645
Speaker 2:  it will not immediately solve all their problems. There's also things like

973
01:01:15,915 --> 01:01:19,845
Speaker 2:  robo Killer and other apps that try to intercept some of that stuff. I

974
01:01:19,845 --> 01:01:23,725
Speaker 2:  found that they work ish, like there are a lot of things like that

975
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:27,565
Speaker 2:  that will make things slightly better, but there is no way to just go and

976
01:01:27,565 --> 01:01:31,445
Speaker 2:  say, do not send me political texts. Unfortunately, by the time

977
01:01:31,445 --> 01:01:35,045
Speaker 2:  you get one, that ship has probably sailed. Your number is in some

978
01:01:35,285 --> 01:01:38,365
Speaker 2:  database. Everybody has access to that database. Those databases get sold

979
01:01:38,405 --> 01:01:42,205
Speaker 2:  a million times over and you are forever resigned to getting a lot

980
01:01:42,205 --> 01:01:46,125
Speaker 2:  of politics texts. One thing I've heard from a bunch of people is that

981
01:01:46,185 --> 01:01:49,605
Speaker 2:  if you are getting a lot of these, using the

982
01:01:49,795 --> 01:01:53,165
Speaker 2:  filters, especially on iOS, that will actually filter out

983
01:01:53,485 --> 01:01:57,205
Speaker 2:  messages from unknown numbers can be really handy if you're getting like

984
01:01:57,205 --> 01:02:01,125
Speaker 2:  an overwhelming number of these. You can go into settings, You can

985
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:04,805
Speaker 2:  filter unread messages and it'll just dump those into, it's kind of the

986
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:08,725
Speaker 2:  equivalent of like the other inbox on Facebook or one of

987
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:12,685
Speaker 2:  the other like LinkedIn kind of social apps that people you haven't

988
01:02:12,685 --> 01:02:16,205
Speaker 2:  necessarily put into your contacts or declared that you care about get

989
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:19,130
Speaker 2:  foisted into that other one. I did that for a while and it turned, turned

990
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:21,765
Speaker 2:  out. I missed a lot of text messages from people who I actually cared about

991
01:02:21,785 --> 01:02:25,685
Speaker 2:  but didn't have their number. Your mileage may vary, so like I said, there

992
01:02:25,685 --> 01:02:29,565
Speaker 2:  are a lot of half measures here, but I think what I would recommend if you're

993
01:02:29,565 --> 01:02:33,445
Speaker 2:  trying to get this down is Google the phone numbers of

994
01:02:33,445 --> 01:02:36,765
Speaker 2:  ones you're getting a lot to make sure that they're legitimate and then

995
01:02:37,465 --> 01:02:41,205
Speaker 2:  delete those text messages, reply, stop and report

996
01:02:41,685 --> 01:02:45,285
Speaker 2:  whatever spam and junk You can to your carrier. That helps you and it helps

997
01:02:45,285 --> 01:02:49,245
Speaker 2:  everybody, but be careful because all it takes is a

998
01:02:49,245 --> 01:02:53,125
Speaker 2:  couple of incorrect responses and all of a sudden you've flagged

999
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:56,405
Speaker 2:  to whoever sent that message and to whoever owns the database of those numbers

1000
01:02:56,425 --> 01:02:59,765
Speaker 2:  and everything else, that you are legit and you are paying attention. And

1001
01:02:59,995 --> 01:03:03,805
Speaker 2:  when you do that to the wrong people it can be a problem. The politics

1002
01:03:03,805 --> 01:03:06,725
Speaker 2:  hacks are only gonna get worse. If you have a better idea about how to get

1003
01:03:06,725 --> 01:03:10,525
Speaker 2:  rid of them, please let me know. I am all ears because I am getting

1004
01:03:10,795 --> 01:03:14,125
Speaker 2:  just aggressively too many of them right now and I'm deeply tired of it too.

1005
01:03:14,545 --> 01:03:18,085
Speaker 2:  So good luck to all of you out there with your text messages. I hope that

1006
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:21,885
Speaker 2:  helps a little. Alright, that is it for The Vergecast today. Thanks to everybody

1007
01:03:21,985 --> 01:03:25,365
Speaker 2:  who came on the show. Thank you for listening. Again, we want to hear everything

1008
01:03:25,365 --> 01:03:28,485
Speaker 2:  you think about these pilots. We're trying new formats. It's been fun to

1009
01:03:28,485 --> 01:03:31,685
Speaker 2:  mess around and see like, are these things we wanna do on The Vergecast?
