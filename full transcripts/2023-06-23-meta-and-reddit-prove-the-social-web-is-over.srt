00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,110
Speaker 4:  Hello and Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Mark

22
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,950
Speaker 4:  Zuckerberg and Elon Musk fighting in a cage.

23
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,230
Speaker 5:  The exclusive team covering it.

24
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,590
Speaker 4:  Alex Heath broke this story. Yeah, that's fine. I'm proud of him. He's

25
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,350
Speaker 4:  a great reporter. Not

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,070
Speaker 6:  Only did Alex Heath break this story, I think Alex Heath like wielded into

27
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,590
Speaker 6:  existence.

28
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,310
Speaker 4:  That's the problem really, is that Alex is

29
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,230
Speaker 4:  goading it into reality. And that's and that's fine. And it, it appear, we

30
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,110
Speaker 4:  can talk about it. It appears Mark Zuckerberg really wants to do this. He

31
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,990
Speaker 4:  should and I feel that we should be very proud of ourselves as The

32
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,950
Speaker 4:  Verge as the journalistic institution that we have become. And

33
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,710
Speaker 4:  also deeply extremely ashamed that this is

34
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,550
Speaker 4:  happening on our watch.

35
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,670
Speaker 6:  That feels right.

36
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,950
Speaker 4:  Here's this story. I'm your friend Neli Alex. Cranz is here.

37
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,270
Speaker 5:  I'm your friend who could take Musk in a fight but probably couldn't take

38
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,870
Speaker 5:  Zuck in a fight.

39
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,670
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna let that sit. David Pierce is here.

40
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,550
Speaker 6:  Hi. I have already called Dibs Own being the sideline reporter who interviews

41
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,550
Speaker 6:  the fighters between rounds. It's gonna be unbelievable. We

42
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,470
Speaker 4:  Run a gigantic sports website, ESP Nation's right there. They have a giant

43
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,350
Speaker 4:  combat sports operation. Ariel Ani is a part of the Vox Media.

44
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,110
Speaker 4:  Fa Wait, we we can do it. No,

45
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,230
Speaker 5:  We're gonna do it. This

46
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,870
Speaker 6:  Is the corporate synergy we've been waiting for.

47
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,790
Speaker 4:  It's DraftKings Nation. The ESP Nation

48
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,790
Speaker 4:  partnership with DraftKings is already like running odds on this fight. It's

49
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,230
Speaker 4:  a lot. There's a lot going on here. Here's what I will tell. We have nothing

50
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,110
Speaker 4:  to do with it by the way. They're just like doing their thing. It's just

51
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,840
Speaker 4:  very funny. Here's the story as we know it today,

52
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,880
Speaker 4:  Instagram is going to launch some competitor to Twitter.

53
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,920
Speaker 4:  It's called Threads. We've seen screenshots of it from presentations that

54
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,160
Speaker 4:  were given inside of Meta. Their position, and this is what they said at

55
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,160
Speaker 4:  the all hands that Alex Heath reported on was people want to competitor to

56
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,080
Speaker 4:  Twitter. That is Sanely run. That's what they said. The

57
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,240
Speaker 4:  audience of Meta employees like clap to this. Which is also very funny given

58
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,040
Speaker 4:  that Meta does not have like a sparkling content moderation

59
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,840
Speaker 4:  track record, but whatever Meta is the company that like

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,040
Speaker 4:  set up the fake supreme court of content moderation. They're doing it a different

61
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,920
Speaker 4:  way. Elon is, I would say not

62
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,720
Speaker 4:  doing it that way. He's running Twitter in a different way.

63
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,200
Speaker 4:  That's

64
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,360
Speaker 5:  That. That feels correct.

65
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I would say interest.

66
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,000
Speaker 5:  That's a very political way to say it. I like that. Yeah.

67
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,360
Speaker 4:  One is a train and the other one is like an out of control haunted

68
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,480
Speaker 4:  car from a horror movie. There are different ways

69
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,800
Speaker 4:  of running a business. You know. Yeah. Every now and again someone on decoder

70
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,880
Speaker 4:  is like, I don't know how I make decisions. I get drunk and flip coins until

71
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,680
Speaker 4:  I fall down. And that's one way to run a business. Okay, fine.

72
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,200
Speaker 4:  So now Elon has been like tweeting about Zuck, like taunts

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,960
Speaker 4:  about this Instagram competitor, this Instagram editor we're gonna talk about

74
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,800
Speaker 4:  in much more detail in just a second because it is causing a lot of drama

75
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,480
Speaker 4:  on the sort of federated social networks of the internet. However,

76
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,840
Speaker 4:  someone goaded Elon into tweeting, he would like to cage fight

77
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,040
Speaker 4:  Zuck. Wait,

78
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,200
Speaker 6:  Can I just, can I just interrupt real fast? Yeah. Not only someone, I'm just,

79
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,840
Speaker 6:  I'm looking at this tweet thread right now and it is like the most beautifully

80
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,600
Speaker 6:  Twitter thing of all time. So Mario Nal I think is how you

81
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,120
Speaker 6:  pronounce it. Tweets, it has lots of followers is like a thing. Elon Musk

82
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,600
Speaker 6:  would potentially have seen. Elon responds to a tweet about

83
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,640
Speaker 6:  Instagram threads being a thing. He responds, I'm sure Earth can't wait to

84
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,720
Speaker 6:  be exclusively under zucks thumb with no other options. At least it will

85
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,320
Speaker 6:  be sane. Was worried there for a moment. Laugh, crying emoji. And then

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,760
Speaker 6:  a person on Twitter who has 68 followers.

87
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,240
Speaker 4:  68 and a blue check one assumes and a blue check. No blue

88
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,120
Speaker 6:  Check's

89
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,360
Speaker 4:  Blue check.

90
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,080
Speaker 6:  This is very surprising. Elon Musk checkin his unverified replies. That's

91
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,800
Speaker 5:  Love that for us. Whose

92
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,720
Speaker 6:  Username is KW Markoff? 2, 6, 6 5 6. And whose

93
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,720
Speaker 6:  username is kw markoff@aol.com. It's very good.

94
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,680
Speaker 6:  Yes. Responds better be careful at Elon Musk. I heard he does the

95
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,320
Speaker 6:  juujitsu now and then nine different laughing

96
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,320
Speaker 6:  emojis. And then to that Elon Musk responds, I'm

97
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,280
Speaker 6:  up for a cage match if he is l o l. Right. And that's how this all began.

98
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,880
Speaker 4:  68 followers, haunted car. That's all I'm

99
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,160
Speaker 4:  saying.

100
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,080
Speaker 5:  A legend

101
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,320
Speaker 4:  Zuck responds to this by screenshotting Elon's tweet. There's

102
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,840
Speaker 4:  apparently a, this is a reference to some famous m m a fighter and he just

103
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,800
Speaker 4:  puts block text over it that says Send me location. You would

104
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,400
Speaker 4:  think that this story has now reached its cringes point.

105
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's like the cringe level there is

106
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,720
Speaker 4:  And, and here's where our friend Alex pours gasoline on the fire. He reaches

107
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,160
Speaker 4:  out to Meta and says, is this real? Does he actually wanna fight

108
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,600
Speaker 4:  Musk? Which is I would say just a very funny

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,400
Speaker 4:  thing for a reporter to ask, does your billionaire c e o

110
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,160
Speaker 4:  wish to fight the other billionaire c e o for real? Or is he just

111
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,280
Speaker 4:  taunting him with references to fighting like in the

112
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,120
Speaker 4:  annals of journalism? That's chapter one. Yeah.

113
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,040
Speaker 5:  And there's like, for most people we assume it's just a taunt because

114
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,680
Speaker 5:  they're very rich, very pasty billionaires.

115
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,800
Speaker 4:  But it is true that Mark Zuckerberg has been training in, he has martial

116
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,520
Speaker 4:  arts, he did like a fight with Rogan and he had made a video of himself

117
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,480
Speaker 4:  training. This is like a whole thing he did. He has competed in tournaments.

118
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,400
Speaker 4:  So Meta PR is like, it speaks for himself. He wants to fight him. And now

119
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,960
Speaker 4:  everything we have heard is that Zuck is actually serious about this. Yeah.

120
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,680
Speaker 4:  That he's pushing for luminaries of the fight world to somehow get involved.

121
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,960
Speaker 4:  Jake Paul is like, I wanna run it on ESPN Plus, which is

122
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,920
Speaker 4:  just very funny. She's

123
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,880
Speaker 5:  Like a fighter too now.

124
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah. There's no money being an influencer as we, we will talk about the

125
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,040
Speaker 4:  den truck interview later, but like you can be a famous influencer and then

126
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,680
Speaker 4:  your immediate move is to find something that will make you money. And

127
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,080
Speaker 6:  And the and the next turn of that is social media CEOs pivoting to combat

128
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,480
Speaker 6:  sports.

129
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,240
Speaker 4:  Right. It's like, it's the same thing. It's like there's not a lot of money

130
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,360
Speaker 4:  in social media. Get that paper review money, you pivot to fighting,

131
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,720
Speaker 4:  you need to collect some actual dollars. Yeah. Anyway, it has,

132
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,520
Speaker 4:  this story has gone from funny Alex Heath joke on the website

133
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,800
Speaker 4:  to what I would describe is an inescapable

134
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,360
Speaker 4:  and exhausting worldwide phenomenon. We are like, people are taking action

135
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,080
Speaker 4:  on this fight that hasn't happened and should not happen.

136
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,760
Speaker 5:  Do you guys remember in 2006 there was this director

137
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,560
Speaker 5:  named Uey Bowl who was known for doing like horrible garbage video

138
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,400
Speaker 5:  game, adapt adaptions and critics hated him and he was like, I'm

139
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,960
Speaker 5:  going to fight my critics. And so he invited them all

140
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,120
Speaker 5:  to fight, including like low tax the founder of something awful.

141
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And proceeded to beat every single one of them.

142
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,560
Speaker 5:  Like destroy them. It was the saddest thing in the world. I knew one of the

143
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,120
Speaker 5:  guys and he's like, yeah, I'm gonna fight him. And you're like, oh. And that's

144
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,840
Speaker 5:  kind of, I'm kind of worried for Elon for that very reason

145
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,360
Speaker 5:  'cause these guys are all like, well whatever he is a film director, I can

146
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,480
Speaker 5:  fight him. And like no, he's like, he's like Zuck. He's like getting a little

147
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,520
Speaker 5:  Was J Jacked was like ready?

148
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,400
Speaker 4:  Well put the link to Zuck fighting a guy in the show notes. There's a YouTube

149
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,160
Speaker 4:  video. Yeah.

150
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,480
Speaker 5:  I don't think it's gonna be, it's gonna be an interesting fight.

151
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,760
Speaker 4:  I want to make it very clear, my position is that these

152
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,500
Speaker 4:  men should not fight each other. That's fair. I fair. Don't think

153
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,860
Speaker 4:  that would be good for the world.

154
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,500
Speaker 5:  No. It would be like the most excruciating thing to

155
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,340
Speaker 5:  watch and just, I think I'd feel like

156
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,380
Speaker 5:  we'd reached the point where we just Yeah. Shut

157
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,620
Speaker 4:  It down. When I say that as my position nominally,

158
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,100
Speaker 4:  that would be the editorial position of The Verge. But I suspect

159
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,080
Speaker 4:  very strongly that in a sort of mutiny type

160
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,280
Speaker 4:  situation, the editorial position of The Verge as composed

161
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,240
Speaker 4:  by its staff is let them fight. Yeah. and I'm a little worried

162
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,840
Speaker 4:  about that, but we're just gonna let it happen.

163
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,400
Speaker 5:  Let them fight. The

164
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,840
Speaker 6:  Only thing I can say with absolute certainty is that there has already been

165
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,680
Speaker 6:  a meeting at the WWE e about how to get Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg

166
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,000
Speaker 6:  into a ring together. Yeah. And if it hasn't, please invite me to that meeting.

167
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,400
Speaker 4:  The last thing I'll say about this and Then, we should actually talk about

168
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,840
Speaker 4:  the, the real drama with Instagram threads. The last thing I'll say is

169
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,480
Speaker 4:  Elon is the WWE E and Zuck is the U F C. And those things are not

170
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,160
Speaker 4:  necessarily compatible, right? Like that's actually the

171
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,080
Speaker 4:  split here. Yeah. Is Elon I think would definitely do the WWE thing. I

172
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,760
Speaker 4:  think Zuck wants to actually punch him in the face.

173
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,800
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that's fair.

174
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,760
Speaker 5:  That feels right.

175
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,240
Speaker 4:  All right, let's talk about the actual, we'll see, I'm sorry.

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
Speaker 4:  I dunno. We

177
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,960
Speaker 5:  Do not condone violence.

178
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,520
Speaker 4:  How do you explain like an apologetic curiosity?

179
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,800
Speaker 5:  I think that's right. Like you're just like You know What if that flits across

180
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,640
Speaker 5:  my eyeballs on a TikTok? That's, I'll wait

181
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,640
Speaker 5:  a second before I swipe up. What's

182
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,640
Speaker 4:  Pre guilt? That's the, that's the word I'm looking for. Type find

183
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,400
Speaker 4:  your chat GPTs and be like what's the word for pre guilt? Send it to me.

184
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,840
Speaker 4:  Okay. We should talk about the real drama with Instagram threads, which

185
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,880
Speaker 4:  I think is like drama. The Verge is designed

186
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,840
Speaker 4:  to cover. So if you like me think that we're reaching

187
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,840
Speaker 4:  a moment for the social web, it appear, it appears to be

188
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,880
Speaker 4:  tearing itself apart. It just is like we're gonna talk about Reddit in the

189
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,360
Speaker 4:  next section. Reddit has come to one sort of conclusion. Twitter has come

190
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,920
Speaker 4:  to a very different sort of conclusion. Facebook isn't sending anybody traffic

191
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,640
Speaker 4:  anymore. Like that thing the web of the sort of mid

192
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,480
Speaker 4:  2010s is like run its course good.

193
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,280
Speaker 4:  Yep. Sure. No one's getting any like animal traffic anymore.

194
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,720
Speaker 4:  You know. Like it's not, it's not if we're not doing it, no

195
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,600
Speaker 5:  Cute pet traffic.

196
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,200
Speaker 4:  Right? And then you see what's happening in the media like Buzzfeed news

197
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,560
Speaker 4:  is shut down and Buzzfeed is pivoting towards like that web, that particular

198
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,520
Speaker 4:  web is coming to a close. Something else is gonna happen. We have

199
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,880
Speaker 4:  talked on The Vergecast and on The Verge a lot about ActivityPub, about Blue

200
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,440
Speaker 4:  Sky, about these federated social networks. And now the first

201
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,640
Speaker 4:  big entrant is it seems Imminent Instagram threads,

202
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,040
Speaker 4:  which we think is compatible with ActivityPub or

203
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,760
Speaker 4:  evidence for this is some good reporting and a little bit of a mention on

204
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,000
Speaker 4:  one slide, but they haven't like launched it. We don't know

205
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,920
Speaker 4:  the existing Federated social network Mastodon and The Fediverse

206
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,880
Speaker 4:  at large, which are run on ActivityPub. I would say David are reacting

207
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,560
Speaker 4:  to this very poorly.

208
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,680
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think that's right. So one of the weird quirks

209
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,000
Speaker 6:  of The Fediverse and Mastodon in particular is that it is

210
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,200
Speaker 6:  very proud of itself and sort of insular. It is not

211
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,610
Speaker 6:  famous for being an open group of people excited to welcome

212
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,440
Speaker 6:  new people in from wherever they're coming. There are norms, we've talked

213
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Speaker 6:  about this on the show, there are norms like everybody calls it the bird

214
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,120
Speaker 6:  site and not Twitter. And if you call it Twitter on Mastodon, you're like

215
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,400
Speaker 6:  shamed for it. It's just a strange place with a very sort of specific set

216
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,080
Speaker 6:  of like in crowdy rules. And the assumption is,

217
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,880
Speaker 6:  and I think correctly. So that if and when Instagram launches

218
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,600
Speaker 6:  threads, this competitor, the code name we've heard is Project

219
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,560
Speaker 6:  92. That it will instantly be by far the biggest thing on The Fediverse,

220
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,360
Speaker 6:  right? Like it, it stands to reason. Instagram is enormous. You'll be able

221
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,320
Speaker 6:  to take your Instagram handle and turn it into your Fediverse handle

222
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,280
Speaker 6:  in this app that will be compatible with ActivityPub. So in

223
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,080
Speaker 6:  that moment, the The Fediverse, this open social web that's

224
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,680
Speaker 6:  powered by ActivityPub goes from a lot of little pieces

225
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,840
Speaker 6:  with Mastodon being kind of the largest little piece to Instagram

226
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,960
Speaker 6:  and then everybody else. And there are a lot of people who

227
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,960
Speaker 6:  on principle do not want Meta to be part of this thing. There's, there is

228
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,920
Speaker 6:  just a, a belief among some people that this would be a bad

229
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,280
Speaker 6:  thing. Meta is a bad company run by bad people who will do bad things for

230
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,360
Speaker 6:  The Fediverse. They will destroy the open standards. They will ruin everything

231
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,200
Speaker 6:  and they are fighting absolute tooth and nail

232
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,520
Speaker 6:  to convince everyone to not even basically allow Meta

233
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,480
Speaker 6:  into this world.

234
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,960
Speaker 5:  I like what's the point of

235
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,800
Speaker 5:  having something be open source and then actively reject

236
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,680
Speaker 5:  when you have new participants.

237
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,920
Speaker 6:  So technically me Meta can do this without asking permission.

238
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,680
Speaker 6:  Right? Right. Like it, it can build a thing on ActivityPub. Terrific. But

239
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,920
Speaker 6:  what is true is if you run, and this is part of the beauty of these systems

240
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,160
Speaker 6:  actually like when it works, what this allows admins to do is say okay,

241
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,600
Speaker 6:  my version of my sort of little corner of The Fediverse is

242
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,480
Speaker 6:  compatible with lots of things, but I get to choose the folks who can't even

243
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,200
Speaker 6:  come into the room, right? Like we're all using the same standard, but I'm

244
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,000
Speaker 6:  not gonna allow these people over here to be part of my club because

245
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,720
Speaker 6:  You know whatever they suck, they're Nazis, they're mean teenage boys.

246
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,760
Speaker 6:  They send nudes whatever. I just don't want them to be part of it. So you

247
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,000
Speaker 6:  have these tools by which everybody is sort of on the same playing field,

248
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,600
Speaker 6:  but you get to like have your own space if that's a thing that you want.

249
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,360
Speaker 6:  And by and large, I think that's a good thing, right? And as this has been

250
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,800
Speaker 6:  small, it has basically been like, okay, if you're gonna be a good actor

251
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,440
Speaker 6:  operating in good faith, we're all gonna be open to each other. And

252
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,040
Speaker 6:  what is now happening is that the largest player by far is

253
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,080
Speaker 6:  perceived by some of these people to not be a good actor acting in good faith.

254
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,560
Speaker 6:  And so what's gonna happen if this boils up into anything and we should talk

255
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,000
Speaker 6:  about whether it's going to, because I'm suspicious that this is actually

256
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Speaker 6:  anything, it's just gonna divide, right? Like there's gonna be two different

257
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,520
Speaker 6:  things powered by the same thing. And it would be like Gmail users not being

258
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,480
Speaker 6:  able to email Outlook users and that's, that's where this would land if Meta

259
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,400
Speaker 6:  and the rest of The Fediverse like really part ways from each other. Yeah.

260
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,760
Speaker 6:  So I think two

261
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,440
Speaker 4:  Things of note here. One, lots of good reasons

262
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,440
Speaker 4:  to not trust Meta

263
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,320
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent.

264
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,120
Speaker 4:  About half of which are directly related to Meta itself

265
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,240
Speaker 4:  and it's actions and it's advertising practices and it's content moderation

266
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,160
Speaker 4:  standards and it's general platforming of unsavory care, the whole thing.

267
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,640
Speaker 4:  So that's about half of the reasons to not trust Meta

268
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,920
Speaker 4:  Meta itself. The other half of the reasons are like the history of

269
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,880
Speaker 4:  this thing happening before Microsoft shows up to

270
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,640
Speaker 4:  the web with Internet Explorer and they're like, we love H T T P.

271
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,480
Speaker 4:  Have you heard of ActiveX? And they just foist a

272
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,360
Speaker 4:  version of the web on top of the web. They had a name for this. It was

273
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,400
Speaker 4:  embrace, extend extinguish. They would embrace the standard, they would extend

274
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,200
Speaker 4:  it with proprietary extensions and they would extinguish the standard and

275
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Speaker 4:  they would be in charge of everything. Famously this got them into so much

276
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,880
Speaker 4:  trouble with the web that the government sued them, almost broke them up,

277
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,360
Speaker 4:  entered into a massive consent decree that created the

278
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,400
Speaker 4:  internet as we know it because Microsoft was distracted from mobile. They

279
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,600
Speaker 4:  had to let Google show up. This whole thing happened. I would note right

280
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,320
Speaker 4:  now, and we will not talk about a lot in this episode, but as we speak,

281
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,360
Speaker 4:  Microsoft is in trial with the F C C about buying Activision

282
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,240
Speaker 4:  and Addie and Tom are covering that in real time. Like while we're taping.

283
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,520
Speaker 4:  So we'll, we'll get to some headlines later from the trial, but we'll cover

284
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,440
Speaker 4:  it in depth on Wednesday. Show Anyhow, embrace

285
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,200
Speaker 4:  Extend Extinguish is real. Microsoft did it to the internet as a whole.

286
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,880
Speaker 4:  Google in many ways has done it to the web. Like big players

287
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,320
Speaker 4:  show up to open communities, they establish themselves as big players and

288
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,000
Speaker 4:  then they take over.

289
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,960
Speaker 6:  My favorite example of this that I think a lot of people remember is messaging

290
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,280
Speaker 6:  services. Remember a million years ago when all the messaging services ran

291
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,360
Speaker 6:  on like similar protocols and you could have an app like Jabber that pulled

292
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,200
Speaker 6:  your SSM Messenger and your Yahoo Messenger and your

293
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,640
Speaker 6:  Google messaging all into one app and everything was sort of cross compatible.

294
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,000
Speaker 6:  And then Google just said, nevermind, Gchat doesn't run on any of that stuff

295
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,680
Speaker 6:  anymore. And it all just instantly broke. That is embrace, extend, extinguish

296
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,320
Speaker 6:  like Yeah. Yeah. That's the job.

297
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,800
Speaker 4:  Very hilariously about that. Speaking of the government, my favorite topic,

298
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,880
Speaker 4:  government regulation of the internet. When a O l bought

299
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,240
Speaker 4:  Time Warner, this is a true thing that happened when, when a O L bought Time

300
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,040
Speaker 4:  Warner, the first time Time Warner killed its host company, which never

301
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,040
Speaker 4:  fails. The government demanded the Bush administration demanded that a

302
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,840
Speaker 4:  o l make a o l instant messenger interoperable because

303
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,240
Speaker 4:  they perceived it at that time, at that time, back in those days

304
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,880
Speaker 4:  to be a moat. So if a L owned the content and a o l owned the sticky

305
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,480
Speaker 4:  messaging service, no no one would switch. Yeah. The Bush

306
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,200
Speaker 4:  administration.

307
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,240
Speaker 5:  Well and it's like speaking of a o l when they first went into

308
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,240
Speaker 5:  Usenet too, right? Yeah. Usenet was was

309
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,200
Speaker 5:  this big community, a lot of nerds. It was the early internet

310
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,080
Speaker 5:  adopters. They were all loving it. A o l started to provide support for

311
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,120
Speaker 5:  Usenet. So like little 13 year old me could be like, yeah, I'm gonna go go

312
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,360
Speaker 5:  have fun.

313
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,800
Speaker 4:  Do You know about the, the story of eternal September? I

314
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,760
Speaker 5:  I kind of know it. I I briefly he lived it but on like I was the trash

315
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,080
Speaker 5:  people.

316
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,360
Speaker 4:  Well

317
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,320
Speaker 5:  I was the ones

318
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,520
Speaker 4:  You've you've come a long way. So it's a small way Eternal. September is

319
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,400
Speaker 4:  one of my favorite phrases Yeah. Of internet lingo. So in the early, early

320
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,080
Speaker 4:  nineties, basically how people got access to the internet would be they,

321
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,000
Speaker 4:  they went to college,

322
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:11,840
Speaker 5:  Right?

323
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,960
Speaker 4:  And like colleges would hand out like tower PCs and ethernet connections

324
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,520
Speaker 4:  in the dorms.

325
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,480
Speaker 5:  You had a fancy college.

326
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,960
Speaker 4:  Well they wouldn't hand they wouldi. They would tell you that you had to

327
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,520
Speaker 4:  buy a tower PC Yeah. And give you an internet connection in dorm. So you

328
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,280
Speaker 4:  people would get to college in September and they would sign onto the

329
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,240
Speaker 4:  internet and onto Usenet for the first time on their hardwired

330
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,840
Speaker 4:  internet connection in their dorm. And they would just wreak

331
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,640
Speaker 4:  havoc on internet forms 'cause they had no idea how to behave. Right. So

332
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,560
Speaker 4:  every September was chaos on the internet because

333
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,200
Speaker 4:  all the kids would show up to college and sign onto the internet for the

334
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,080
Speaker 4:  first time and just act like college students on the internet. And then

335
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,800
Speaker 4:  the community was big enough and they, they could see that this was happening.

336
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,240
Speaker 4:  It was like time boxed enough that they would wrangle the college students

337
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,240
Speaker 4:  back into line. Yeah. And the community would operate until they teach them.

338
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,280
Speaker 4:  The next September, September, 1994 would come and a

339
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,120
Speaker 4:  bunch of college students would show up and be idiots on Usenet and they

340
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,000
Speaker 4:  would wrangle them back in line. So every September is chaos. A o l shows

341
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,800
Speaker 4:  up says now every a o l user has access to Usenet.

342
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,480
Speaker 4:  And remember this is like the dominant service provider America was online,

343
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:21,880
Speaker 4:  my friends,

344
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,760
Speaker 5:  We were online

345
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,600
Speaker 4:  And they flooded Usenet with like everyone's a mom

346
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,840
Speaker 4:  and like all caps yelling and like crazy. And the Usenet

347
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,440
Speaker 4:  community started calling this the September that ever ends it Eternal September

348
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,160
Speaker 4:  because it just, it was just always September every day. Yeah. Was new

349
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,040
Speaker 4:  chaos And the community could no longer wrangle it back into line.

350
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,880
Speaker 4:  It was just escalating chaos.

351
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,040
Speaker 5:  I got kicked out of an X-Files Usenet during that time.

352
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,360
Speaker 5:  'cause I was like 10 or 11. I didn't know what I was doing.

353
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,240
Speaker 5:  I wasn't very good at it. Yeah,

354
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,720
Speaker 4:  You were, you were part of eternal September. Yeah,

355
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,000
Speaker 5:  I was part of the eternal September. It was just, what's up nerds? Let's

356
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,240
Speaker 4:  Talk Alex is like, I'm the face of eternal September. Yeah. It's me. So this

357
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,200
Speaker 4:  is, this to me is like one of those moments. So it's a great Jason Coler

358
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,480
Speaker 4:  advice has a great article about September forever. You should go read it.

359
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,920
Speaker 4:  We'll put it in the show notes. This is one of the concepts that has defined

360
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,440
Speaker 4:  like internet communities for generations now

361
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,400
Speaker 4:  since the early nineties. This concept of eternal September. You build this

362
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,160
Speaker 4:  tiny little community and then it hits the scale point of an influx of new

363
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,720
Speaker 4:  users in the existing moderators existing community.

364
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,160
Speaker 4:  The norms disappear because you just can't constantly enforce them the way

365
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,960
Speaker 4:  you could when it was You know however many college students

366
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,400
Speaker 4:  went to college that September. Right now it's everybody all the time.

367
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,800
Speaker 4:  and I think a lot of what Mastodon is responding to

368
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,360
Speaker 4:  is Yep. Meta for Meta. Very valid criticisms there. Yes.

369
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,600
Speaker 4:  Embrace, extend, extinguish, but also, oh shit, our club's

370
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,200
Speaker 4:  about to not be exclusive anymore.

371
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,360
Speaker 5:  I see. That's the part where I really think they're being overly dramatic.

372
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,360
Speaker 5:  And I'm so sorry to you MAs it on users. You were with me in the eternal

373
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,800
Speaker 5:  September. Like come on guys, you're you're being a little dramatic.

374
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,720
Speaker 4:  I think people on Mastodon might've been the people who experienced they

375
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,880
Speaker 4:  probably Yeah. The other side of eternal

376
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,960
Speaker 5:  September. Yeah. They were, you guys were probably on the other side of it

377
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,680
Speaker 5:  and you should know better at this point because one,

378
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,600
Speaker 5:  it's hard to find things on Mastodon currently. So how likely

379
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,480
Speaker 5:  is it that all of those people coming from Instagram are gonna suddenly be

380
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,320
Speaker 5:  descending in into all of these Mastodon communities really even

381
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,640
Speaker 5:  if you don't block them? 'cause a lot of them it sounds like are Blocking

382
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:30,840
Speaker 5:  them

383
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,840
Speaker 4:  And they're not organized the same way at all. Right?

384
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,800
Speaker 5:  Right. Like, so there's that part of it. And two, when things are

385
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,240
Speaker 5:  more accessible, it tends to make things better. Like, I don't know if I

386
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,920
Speaker 5:  would work at The, Verge and and b in this community if I

387
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,800
Speaker 5:  hadn't had that access at a young age. and I certainly hadn't had the, didn't

388
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,520
Speaker 5:  have the tools then to access Usenet the way the rest of you guys were

389
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,480
Speaker 5:  accessing it. So like I think making things more accessible is

390
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,440
Speaker 5:  always better. And yes, it does mean that the, that it

391
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,240
Speaker 5:  dilutes these communities pretty quickly and it does change

392
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,640
Speaker 5:  things, but it often ultimately changes things for the better.

393
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,480
Speaker 5:  Even though in this case Meta is the one doing the changing

394
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,880
Speaker 5:  and that creates a whole other set set of issues.

395
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,040
Speaker 6:  I really think the fact that it's Meta that the thing here, okay and

396
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,040
Speaker 6:  I think it's, it's the fact that it's Meta across kind of all three

397
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,920
Speaker 6:  of the points you just made. Neli. Like even in the case of

398
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,720
Speaker 6:  there are about to be a lot of people coming and sort of disrupting our club,

399
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,400
Speaker 6:  which I think is real, right? I think Macedon in particular has this real

400
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,440
Speaker 6:  like we are the, i we are the place that you go to

401
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,360
Speaker 6:  get away from Twitter, right? Like that's, that's its vibe. And in

402
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,120
Speaker 6:  the same way that Twitter is obsessed with Twitter, like Mastodon is obsessed

403
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,040
Speaker 6:  with Twitter. It really is. And now Meta is coming

404
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,920
Speaker 6:  in and a there I would say there it is overwhelmingly likely

405
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,120
Speaker 6:  that Instagram's product is going to be a

406
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,920
Speaker 6:  better product than Mastodon. Yeah. It's gonna have a better

407
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,400
Speaker 6:  identity system because it's gonna borrow it from Instagram, it's gonna have

408
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Speaker 6:  better discovery because that's something that Meta is really good at. Like

409
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,160
Speaker 6:  it will, it will immediately be the default product for The

410
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,880
Speaker 6:  Fediverse. I'm not, I wouldn't guarantee that that's gonna happen, but I

411
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,760
Speaker 6:  would say that is overwhelmingly likely that's what's gonna happen. That

412
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,400
Speaker 6:  it will, it will instantly be the biggest and best thing on The Fediverse.

413
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,120
Speaker 6:  And so you bring in not just a flood of new people,

414
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,320
Speaker 6:  but a flood of new people coming from Instagram, which has its own set of

415
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,280
Speaker 6:  rules and norms and cultures that people hate and I think

416
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,000
Speaker 6:  if, if Mozilla suddenly brought in You know a hundred

417
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,240
Speaker 6:  million people on Mozilla social, I think there would be people with feelings.

418
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,040
Speaker 6:  But it would not be this aggressive and contentious and

419
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,600
Speaker 6:  like knee jerk. We can't allow these people here. But because it's Meta and

420
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,000
Speaker 6:  I think specifically because it's Instagram and because it's like you, you

421
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,560
Speaker 6:  can just imagine what all the like celebrities and

422
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,880
Speaker 6:  influencers and commenters on Instagram will do. Well

423
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,840
Speaker 4:  I can make that simpler for you. It's a bunch of girls, right? Like there's,

424
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,280
Speaker 4:  there's a part of this where because it's Instagram, a bunch of

425
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,720
Speaker 4:  dude nerds on Mastodon who figured out how to set up a Mastodon

426
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,960
Speaker 4:  account and like did it and like passed all the nerd tests

427
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,720
Speaker 4:  is like we no girls allowed.

428
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,600
Speaker 5:  There's a big strong vibe of like when I go into a comic

429
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,560
Speaker 5:  shop and I have to then like defend my

430
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,080
Speaker 5:  knowledge of comics and usually show them the Superman poster.

431
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,080
Speaker 5:  There's a bit like that's the feeling I'm getting here where it's just like,

432
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,000
Speaker 5:  oh you can't join. And it's like guys get over yourself. Yeah. Like I

433
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,560
Speaker 5:  don't think all these Instagram influencers are gonna be descending on your

434
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,960
Speaker 5:  mastodons and destroying this. Well, so this is actually world, the Tumblr

435
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,560
Speaker 5:  users that are eventually coming and all the other ActivityPub

436
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,400
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Users like get over it guys.

437
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,920
Speaker 4:  I think this is the big difference between what's happening now and the,

438
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,280
Speaker 4:  the Usenet example that we were talking about, right? Which is Usenet was

439
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,200
Speaker 4:  organized by topic. So I cannot believe I'm explaining Usenet on the broadcast

440
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,040
Speaker 4:  in 2023. It's

441
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,160
Speaker 5:  I'm having the best time.

442
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,440
Speaker 4:  The fact that we are currently embarking on completely resetting the

443
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,280
Speaker 4:  internet is so exciting to me. and I feel like I might be the only one who

444
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,200
Speaker 4:  can see it at all times. We are going back people we are in

445
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,720
Speaker 4:  fully, everything old is new again territory. And it is deeply

446
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Speaker 4:  entertaining. I

447
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,160
Speaker 6:  Forget who it was, but I was listening to somebody a few months ago who said

448
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,480
Speaker 6:  that when we read about this era in the history books, the last 15 years

449
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,520
Speaker 6:  will be a blip on the radar. It will be like one giant false

450
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,360
Speaker 6:  start that we all made towards one way that the internet could work. And

451
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,640
Speaker 6:  Then we went right back to the way it was before and kept moving forward.

452
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,280
Speaker 6:  and I honestly think that's where we're headed

453
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:36,480
Speaker 4:  Until this ends 15 years from now. And we go right back to a bunch of centralized

454
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,160
Speaker 4:  social networking

455
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,800
Speaker 6:  Services. That's fair.

456
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,560
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Use net's still out there. It's still,

457
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,360
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Pendulums swing back and forth unfortunately. Yeah. But use, they never

458
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,320
Speaker 4:  landed exactly the right spot and stay there. We haven't figured that out

459
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,800
Speaker 4:  yet. But anyway, so the way Usenet was organized was ba more or less Reddit.

460
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,640
Speaker 4:  Like Reddit is closer to how use networked. So imagine if every

461
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,880
Speaker 4:  September 10 million absolute newbies descended

462
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,680
Speaker 4:  on Reddit, found all the topics they wanted and started going insane, right?

463
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,400
Speaker 4:  Like that's how that worked. That's not how Twitter works. That's not how

464
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,160
Speaker 4:  Instagram threads is gonna work. I think there's still a follow graph there.

465
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,280
Speaker 4:  Like no one's going to find your like furries mastodon

466
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,800
Speaker 4:  and be like, I'm in it now. I will. Right? And so the question of de Federating

467
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,680
Speaker 4:  is really just a question of whether you want to be connected to Meta as

468
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,720
Speaker 4:  a version of this at all.

469
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,240
Speaker 6:  Well that's, that's true and it isn't. Right? Like I think one of the interesting

470
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,160
Speaker 6:  things about the way that The Fediverse works is you, you can have things

471
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,040
Speaker 6:  like tags that Yeah. Actually do work across instances. And

472
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,840
Speaker 6:  there are people out there who have really careful

473
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,640
Speaker 6:  systems for how things get tagged and how we think about topics. And you

474
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,600
Speaker 6:  can sort of be in your own space but also have access to, through things

475
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,280
Speaker 6:  like tags and topics, the other stuff that's out there. It's definitely a

476
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,000
Speaker 6:  smaller part of how it works. But I think because it's still such a like

477
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,840
Speaker 6:  power user tool, there are definitely a lot of people on Mastodon

478
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,280
Speaker 6:  who have like curated tag sets that they use and all of a sudden,

479
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,880
Speaker 6:  like, do you remember when this happened on Instagram? All of a sudden everybody

480
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,440
Speaker 6:  got nuts about the tags to try and game. Yeah. The explore page when people

481
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,680
Speaker 6:  are going around. I think that's the kind of thing that people worry about

482
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,760
Speaker 6:  and it's exactly what you're describing. I think it's, it's definitely less

483
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,200
Speaker 6:  likely than it would be if something like this were to happen to say Reddit

484
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,320
Speaker 6:  like you said. But I do think that risk is real here. Yeah,

485
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,800
Speaker 4:  That's fair. We'll see, I I think this is among the most

486
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,800
Speaker 4:  interesting versions of this to tap right? The,

487
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,760
Speaker 4:  the parallels to lots of other things are there. And what's interesting is

488
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,280
Speaker 4:  that many of those things have played out. Microsoft attempting to

489
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,250
Speaker 4:  colonize the web played itself out. Like from start to finish.

490
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,850
Speaker 4:  We, we see how that went. And actually a little bit of

491
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,730
Speaker 4:  intervention, a little bit of competition, they were unsuccessful

492
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,370
Speaker 4:  at doing it

493
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,970
Speaker 5:  And now they're a big baby

494
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,930
Speaker 4:  And now they just, they just want to own Call of Duty. Why won't you let

495
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,250
Speaker 4:  them have it? Gosh. You can see how Google's various attempts to colonize

496
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,850
Speaker 4:  web have been successful and unsuccessful over time. Another great

497
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,930
Speaker 4:  example actually is Apple and open source kind of in

498
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,490
Speaker 4:  a general sense. Like they showed up with an open source

499
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,330
Speaker 4:  kernel in OSS 10. Everyone thought they were gonna pick Linux. They picked

500
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,210
Speaker 4:  another project. That project does not have a life outside of Apple.

501
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,490
Speaker 4:  Right? Like they just like took it and they made it their thing. They did

502
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,890
Speaker 4:  the same thing with the rendering engine inside of Safari. They, they took

503
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,730
Speaker 4:  an existing one, they built upon it. Now that Apple dominates

504
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,410
Speaker 4:  that environment. Right? Those are all good things. I don't think

505
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,570
Speaker 4:  no one's looking back and saying, man, web kit really ruined our open source

506
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,450
Speaker 4:  project. Yeah.

507
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,050
Speaker 5:  Apple adopting Unix really destroyed everything.

508
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,370
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We've just seen that these cycles come and go in various different

509
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,330
Speaker 4:  ways. and I think fundamentally they, they're not good

510
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,930
Speaker 4:  or bad, but the parallels are there and the negatives are there and people

511
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,890
Speaker 4:  are like extremely wide open to them. And this one is particularly

512
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,810
Speaker 4:  funny 'cause it is the oldest of them all right? It's the

513
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,650
Speaker 4:  big service provider dumping users on a pretty closed system

514
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,730
Speaker 4:  or a pretty small system and like they're, they're having the same reaction

515
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,570
Speaker 4:  as a bunch of people in the nineties had to it. Yeah. I suspect some of them

516
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,450
Speaker 4:  are the same people from the nineties. Yeah. Which is pretty

517
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,170
Speaker 4:  good. I'm

518
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,970
Speaker 5:  Gonna be, I'm gonna be on the other side again. Yeah. 'cause like I've got

519
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,650
Speaker 5:  my Mastodon account, I barely understand how it works and as soon as the

520
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,530
Speaker 5:  Instagram threads comes along Yeah, I'll give it a go. 'cause the user experience

521
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,610
Speaker 5:  will likely be a lot easier. Yes. And at this point in my life, I'm not

522
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,090
Speaker 5:  interested in tinkering with that. I've got a whole smart home to tinker

523
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,810
Speaker 5:  with. I don't need to tinker with my social media. So like, yeah,

524
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,130
Speaker 5:  okay I wanna go experience it this way and see what it's like when you

525
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,850
Speaker 5:  have all of those resources. You have like very good user

526
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,520
Speaker 5:  interface designers and stuff participating in this.

527
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,680
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And we also just don't know what level of interoperability

528
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,680
Speaker 4:  there's going to be. Yeah.

529
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,440
Speaker 5:  It may suck, right? Like it could just be garbage and it

530
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,960
Speaker 5:  doesn't even touch most of the rest of The Fediverse. And then it's like,

531
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,320
Speaker 5:  well boy we sure panicked.

532
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,000
Speaker 4:  Well so is it you can post and people can follow you.

533
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,040
Speaker 4:  People on a different server can follow your Instagram account. You can follow

534
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,960
Speaker 4:  people from different servers. That seems like the basics, right? There's

535
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,720
Speaker 4:  a lot of other things you can do. You can build custom moderation services.

536
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,360
Speaker 4:  That's what Flipboard is doing with, with Blue Sky and others. You could,

537
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,360
Speaker 4:  they could have it moderate, not with Mastodon, but with these Reddit

538
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,240
Speaker 4:  alternatives like Lemi and Kabin, there's a lot of ways. So there, from

539
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,160
Speaker 4:  what we understand, Instagram is like starting to have meetings. The meetings

540
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,000
Speaker 4:  are under N D A, which is also extremely contentious

541
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,160
Speaker 4:  in this community. Yep. I'll tell you, when we go have meetings at these

542
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,280
Speaker 4:  companies, we don, we're journalists, we don't, we don't sign the NDAs. I

543
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,560
Speaker 4:  always just look at the, the iPad they have and I say no and then

544
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:46,130
Speaker 4:  there's a sigh and they go and get me a different badge. And that badge

545
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,370
Speaker 4:  is like, don't talk to this person, don't look at this person.

546
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,050
Speaker 4:  So I get it, don't sign the NDAs. But I think these

547
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,690
Speaker 4:  conversations are basically Meta slash Instagram is trying to be a good

548
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,690
Speaker 4:  participant and like what they're facing is we don't want you to be here.

549
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,970
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I I do think one, one more sort of broad point I would

550
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,850
Speaker 6:  make is, I think one of the things that is a real worry

551
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:13,810
Speaker 6:  is that The Fediverse is absolutely not ready for this many people. I

552
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,170
Speaker 6:  think you could argue that the Fediverse isn't ready to have as many people

553
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,130
Speaker 6:  as it currently has. It's, it's been a really interesting thing to watch

554
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,650
Speaker 6:  both with Twitter folks going to Mastodon and with Reddit folks going to

555
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,490
Speaker 6:  things like Lemi and Caban. Those products are not done. They're like beta

556
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,410
Speaker 6:  tech projects that everyone who works on them can make you a long list of

557
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:34,250
Speaker 6:  the things that's wrong with them. And they're now trying to figure out

558
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,250
Speaker 6:  and it's just complicated and slow work

559
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,930
Speaker 6:  to build one of these things. And then all of a sudden, like it's not an

560
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,770
Speaker 6:  accident that like nobody was talking about Cain and then all of a sudden

561
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,370
Speaker 6:  a lot of Reddit users start looking for somewhere to go. They find it. And

562
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,450
Speaker 6:  even on Cain's website it's like this is Alpha software

563
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,690
Speaker 6:  but people are showing up because they just need somewhere to go. Right.

564
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,690
Speaker 6:  and I think one of the things on this Fetti pact that a lot of people

565
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:01,650
Speaker 6:  are signing, which is this like incredible hot pink website, it's beautiful.

566
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,530
Speaker 6:  One of the very first things that they mention about why this is

567
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:09,290
Speaker 6:  a thing that you should sign and you should not let Meta on

568
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,210
Speaker 6:  is about content moderation. And it's partly about content moderation

569
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,290
Speaker 6:  based on the assumption that Meta is bad at it and won't do it for its own

570
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,810
Speaker 6:  stuff, which will then pollute the rest of The Fediverse. But it's also about

571
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:24,490
Speaker 6:  the fact that no one has figured this out because this got to scale so fast

572
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,810
Speaker 6:  that most of the content moderation is done by the people who own the specific

573
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,570
Speaker 6:  servers, which is just like a dude in his house for the most part. And

574
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,290
Speaker 6:  figuring out how to do content moderation at this scale has been tough. Like

575
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,620
Speaker 6:  when I wrote this story about ActivityPub, I think it was a Neil Dash that

576
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,260
Speaker 6:  I was talking to who was like, if Instagram shows up and just dumps

577
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,420
Speaker 6:  30 million people into The Fediverse, the whole thing is going to collapse.

578
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,060
Speaker 6:  and I think that's a real valid fear. Like Mastodon is

579
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,420
Speaker 6:  by no means a finished product that is ready for this many people to be interacting

580
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,380
Speaker 6:  with it. Right.

581
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,380
Speaker 5:  That's fair.

582
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,500
Speaker 4:  I just, the You know, You know how fuck, it's impossible. This is an

583
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,940
Speaker 4:  impossible task. And yes, the thing that they are saying about content

584
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,860
Speaker 4:  moderation is not Meta is bad at it. I think Meta is exactly

585
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,420
Speaker 4:  as good at it as it wants to be.

586
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:10,340
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

587
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,620
Speaker 4:  And it's actually like if you take the politics out of it,

588
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,300
Speaker 4:  Meta is very good at it. You get to the politics of it

589
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,940
Speaker 4:  specifically what speech, what kinds of speech will and won't be allowed.

590
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:26,140
Speaker 4:  Meta has made some decisions that I disagree with that other people disagree

591
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,860
Speaker 4:  with, that many people agree with, disagree with. On the other side of the

592
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,740
Speaker 4:  coin and really what people are reacting to, what almost everyone is always

593
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,100
Speaker 4:  reacting to is those decisions on the margin. And so You

594
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,980
Speaker 4:  know the position of Mastodon as a collection of people is we wish

595
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,860
Speaker 4:  to be so tolerant that some people are banned, which is

596
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,980
Speaker 4:  really where you come back around to Yeah. Like Donald Trump Jr. Is not welcome

597
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,620
Speaker 4:  here is like a very tolerant position in its own

598
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,580
Speaker 4:  weird, twisted way. Okay. Like Meta is gonna make a very

599
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,540
Speaker 4:  different kind of determination and that's the content moderation that they're

600
00:33:59,540 --> 00:33:59,940
Speaker 4:  talking about.

601
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,300
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

602
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,380
Speaker 4:  Like I that, I think that's where I'm always the most interested

603
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,300
Speaker 4:  in The. Fediverse is lots of different servers can make lots of different

604
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,460
Speaker 4:  decisions and you're not tied to them forever. Right. You can go

605
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,620
Speaker 4:  somewhere else, you can follow people on different servers or different rules.

606
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,180
Speaker 4:  The market such as it may ever exist is actually making those

607
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,900
Speaker 4:  speech determinations and not the government or

608
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,700
Speaker 4:  one guy, one guy who's delegated to a bunch of lawyers that you never hear

609
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,620
Speaker 4:  about like that to, that's where, that's where the mistake has been. I just

610
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,500
Speaker 5:  Don't see that that's their real concern tho those who are,

611
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,380
Speaker 5:  who are fighting against Meta because like, what's it like, what's the point

612
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,060
Speaker 5:  of The Fediverse where every instance can determine its own content moderation

613
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,260
Speaker 5:  if you don't let people determine their own content moderation. Like I get

614
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,100
Speaker 5:  that it's a big company coming in and I think that's a certainly a thing

615
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,820
Speaker 5:  to be fearful of, but like it stands on content moderation isn't

616
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,660
Speaker 5:  because like that's the point of The Fediverse, they get to decide that.

617
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,180
Speaker 5:  They get to decide that for their users and all of those 30 million or whoever,

618
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,500
Speaker 5:  10,000,005 people that join Instagram threads or whatever

619
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,140
Speaker 5:  it ends up being called. Yeah.

620
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,620
Speaker 4:  But you don't have to, you don't have to contribute value to it. Yeah. Right.

621
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,460
Speaker 4:  You're like, this is my club and you can't just like take the content out

622
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,300
Speaker 4:  of it and put it into your app. Right. In many ways you kind of end up

623
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,860
Speaker 4:  right at this weird Reddit situation. Yeah. Where like my server's

624
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,740
Speaker 4:  content, which is really what my users have contributed to, I'll

625
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,700
Speaker 4:  control the boundaries of Right. I'll not let AI scrape it and I will not

626
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,380
Speaker 4:  let it interact with Meta's product and I, I think we're we're just in for

627
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,080
Speaker 4:  a few years of the internet refiguring out

628
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,480
Speaker 4:  that dynamic. Yeah.

629
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,560
Speaker 5:  And I think that's gonna be fun. Yeah. I'm excited for that.

630
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,200
Speaker 4:  I I mean this is like, again, I think this is why The Verge exists because

631
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,200
Speaker 4:  covering the story is a, you have to start with Usenet, which is perfect,

632
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,240
Speaker 4:  and b, it's is much of a technical capability

633
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:57,920
Speaker 4:  story is it is a how do people behave on the internet

634
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,880
Speaker 4:  as it is a what is Mattis's product gonna be? Story and I.

635
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,920
Speaker 4:  I frankly challenge you to find another group of nerds that will pay attention

636
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,840
Speaker 4:  to it as as much as we will. Alright. We need to take a break. I

637
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,360
Speaker 4:  need to watch this video of Mark Zuckerberg and Jiujitsu mats one more time.

638
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,720

661
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,800
Speaker 5:  It's done. It's passed. It's done.

662
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,720
Speaker 4:  We, we You know there's gadgets to talk about. Yeah. Come on. There's a trial

663
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,320
Speaker 4:  going on. All right. We do need to talk about Reddit though. J

664
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,400
Speaker 4:  Peters has been just owning the Reddit story top to bottom. It's

665
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,360
Speaker 4:  he interviewed Steve Huffman that interview went. It went.

666
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:09,880
Speaker 4:  Sure did. Haunted car. It's fine. Reddit is,

667
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,360
Speaker 4:  You know they're staying the course. They're not backing down in any which

668
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,680
Speaker 4:  way. I would say. The protests have gotten increasingly hilarious and true

669
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,400
Speaker 4:  Reddit style. At one point Reddit said this needs to be more

670
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:24,360
Speaker 4:  democratic. It can't just be the moderators. I think Steve Huffin

671
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,920
Speaker 4:  referred to the moderators as the landed gentry of Reddit. Yeah. Which is

672
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,400
Speaker 4:  very funny. So the moderators started holding votes. Many

673
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,360
Speaker 4:  subreddits, including I think our awe others said, okay, we're only

674
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,280
Speaker 4:  allowing pictures of John Oliver. We're our users voted on it. There's nothing

675
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,440
Speaker 4:  he can do. That's what we're

676
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,880
Speaker 6:  Doing. I think. Not just pictures, but sexy pictures of John Oliver. Sexy.

677
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,840
Speaker 6:  That's a very important part

678
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,800
Speaker 4:  Of it. John Oliver has been like, he, we uploaded a folder of photos

679
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,880
Speaker 4:  for them to use, which is very good. Other subreddits allowed not

680
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,440
Speaker 4:  safe for work content, which is very funny. Reddit did not like this at all.

681
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,600
Speaker 4:  No. Just various other protests. Like

682
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,480
Speaker 5:  Did You know the, the female fashion advice subreddit is only

683
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,040
Speaker 5:  doing posts about 17 hundreds fashion now.

684
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,960
Speaker 5:  It's so good. That's

685
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,680
Speaker 4:  Very good. Some Reddits have made everybody a moderator in like

686
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:15,440
Speaker 4:  true democracy also. Very good. I don't know if this is

687
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,280
Speaker 4:  accomplishing anything. 'cause all these people are still using Reddit. Right?

688
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,210
Speaker 4:  So going dark is like a direct attack on

689
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:26,210
Speaker 4:  Reddit because new users, search users can't access the communities.

690
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:30,010
Speaker 4:  Everyone's gonna show up and post pictures of John Oliver. What's Reddit

691
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,170
Speaker 4:  gonna do? Like

692
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,690
Speaker 5:  Enjoy the engagement.

693
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,610
Speaker 6:  I don't know though. I think people on the internet have learned at this

694
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:40,490
Speaker 6:  point that just saying we're not gonna use this

695
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:44,250
Speaker 6:  product anymore. Doesn't work. Right? Like you can't, you can't organize

696
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,290
Speaker 6:  traffic killing. But what you can do, and one of the things I think has been

697
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:51,970
Speaker 6:  very clever is like all of these subreddits categorizing

698
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,650
Speaker 6:  themselves as not safe for work, which means they don't get monetized in

699
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,610
Speaker 6:  the same way. And so that's like, there's a direct hit to what

700
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,970
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Reddit actually cares about, which is its money. These things with

701
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:06,650
Speaker 6:  John Oliver, like it's you just at the same time Steve

702
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:10,530
Speaker 6:  Huffman is at can trying to get more advertisers to

703
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:14,290
Speaker 6:  come on. Reddit is just making a joke of itself as a platform,

704
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:17,130
Speaker 6:  which in a way I would actually argue is a much more powerful version of

705
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,810
Speaker 6:  protest. Which is to say like, oh, you think you actually run this platform?

706
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,010
Speaker 6:  Like, hell no, you don't. We run this platform and you can, you can try and

707
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,930
Speaker 6:  fight us all you want. We're actually in charge of what happens here.

708
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,330
Speaker 6:  and I think, like to me that has actually come through like loud and clear.

709
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:32,970
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

710
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:37,050
Speaker 5:  But does it mean anything at the end of the day?

711
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,010
Speaker 6:  No. And it won't. And all these apps are gonna shut down and Reddit is going

712
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,730
Speaker 6:  to go about its business, but it it, at least it feels like you

713
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,450
Speaker 6:  can feel like you tried. Well,

714
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,810
Speaker 4:  So here's the thing that's really I think happening. Reddit is now

715
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:52,810
Speaker 4:  imposing its power over this community. They sent an email to

716
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:56,770
Speaker 4:  a bunch of the moderators of the subs that had gone private. The

717
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:00,650
Speaker 4:  email was a threat. Like, I don't, I'm not gonna beat around the bush. Oh

718
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,970
Speaker 4:  yeah. It is not in the language of a threat, but the email was, Hey,

719
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,930
Speaker 4:  if you want to get rid of the moderators who've chosen to go private

720
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,290
Speaker 4:  or you think they're not doing the job, let us know and we'll help you get

721
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:15,050
Speaker 4:  rid of them. And like that's what, how, how else should you read this?

722
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,370
Speaker 4:  If I'm a moderator that is choosing to stay dark, Reddit is emailing my

723
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,370
Speaker 4:  fellow moderators and the users of the subreddits and saying

724
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,130
Speaker 4:  they can get rid of me if I stay the course.

725
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,170
Speaker 6:  Right. And it went even further in some cases. There was a, there was a thing

726
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,770
Speaker 6:  they were saying to moderators that was essentially by taking

727
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,880
Speaker 6:  your sub Reddit dark, you're actually violating the terms of

728
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,880
Speaker 6:  the code of conduct on Reddit because you're not being good

729
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,720
Speaker 6:  to your community by not letting people use it. Which is a

730
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,840
Speaker 6:  leap. But then the threat there is that the consequence for not taking care

731
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,200
Speaker 6:  of your community is Reddit will remove you as a moderator and put somebody

732
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,280
Speaker 6:  else in. So they, they've been making abundantly clear that like, play by

733
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,720
Speaker 6:  the rules or we'll just throw you out and find somebody who will Yeah. In

734
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,440
Speaker 6:  every way they can.

735
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:01,160
Speaker 4:  Which is again, they, they wrote the rules. They're allowed to say you should

736
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,640
Speaker 4:  play by them. But the attitude and the posture here are

737
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,560
Speaker 4:  extremely aggressive. And You know if you are communicating,

738
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,560
Speaker 4:  one responsibility you have is to how people feel about how you're communicating.

739
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,160
Speaker 4:  And so if the moderators are telling us they feel threatened, those are,

740
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,120
Speaker 4:  those are threats. Like that's just how that works. If Right. That's life.

741
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,440
Speaker 4:  Well,

742
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,400
Speaker 6:  And what's so weird about this to me is like, Reddit's been around for 18

743
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:27,360
Speaker 6:  years. Like where has this been? Like, at least when Twitter went insane,

744
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,280
Speaker 6:  it was because somebody bought it. Right? Like at least, at least something

745
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,680
Speaker 6:  changed. and I think part of what has been so strange for Redditers is this

746
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,480
Speaker 6:  sense that like, okay, there's a guy in charge who's been on Reddit literally

747
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,320
Speaker 6:  since the beginning. He is a co-founder of the thing. He loves

748
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,720
Speaker 6:  this more than anybody. And all of a sudden just like on a dime just decides

749
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,120
Speaker 6:  to totally screw over the entire community all at once. and I think like

750
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,600
Speaker 6:  the actions have felt bad, but I think this like total surprise of it

751
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,800
Speaker 6:  all is the worst part of a lot of it for some folks.

752
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,120
Speaker 5:  Because for most people it really did come out of nowhere. It was just like

753
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,560
Speaker 5:  one minute,

754
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,600
Speaker 6:  It was that New York Times story. Like all of a sudden it's just like, oh,

755
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,680
Speaker 6:  Steve Huffin wants to make money and then everyone read. It's like, oh shit.

756
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And just fury. Yeah.

757
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well and killing the app. I mean that's the real thing. Like the rollout,

758
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,240
Speaker 4:  that's the precipitating factor. Right. But this we are in

759
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,760
Speaker 4:  control of Reddit is new. So here's the thing I wanted to bring up. We have

760
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,280
Speaker 4:  been reporting on this left and right. Jay Peters on our team owns the story.

761
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,160
Speaker 4:  He's the one who interviewed Huffman. Lots of mods are talking to him.

762
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,200
Speaker 4:  Lots of Reddit people are talking to him like good journalists.

763
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,800
Speaker 4:  We go to Reddit for comment on all these stories. Reddit is very unhappy

764
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,720
Speaker 4:  that people are talking to us. They have decided that their

765
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,840
Speaker 4:  official position is that they will wait for us to make mistakes and

766
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,920
Speaker 4:  then issue corrections in order to discredit our journalism. That's

767
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,560
Speaker 4:  straight up what they're doing. and I know this is what they're doing because

768
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,920
Speaker 4:  we have a statement. 'cause they

769
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,360
Speaker 6:  Told us, 'cause they told

770
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,240
Speaker 4:  Us Tim Rashme, who runs comms at Reddit says their blanket

771
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,080
Speaker 4:  statement is, will no longer comment on hearsay, unsubstantiated

772
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,880
Speaker 4:  claims or baseless accusations from The. Verge will be in touch as

773
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,720
Speaker 4:  corrections are needed.

774
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,680
Speaker 5:  Oh my guy,

775
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:09,880
Speaker 4:  I've been playing this game a long time. We'll wait for you to make a mistake.

776
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,200
Speaker 4:  So Then, we can correct you and say your reporting was wrong is the oldest

777
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:16,560
Speaker 4:  trick in the book and we are just not gonna fall for it. So we're just gonna

778
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,920
Speaker 4:  print this statement in every story from here on out. Like that's the way

779
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,760
Speaker 4:  it's gonna go. And if they want us to get it right, they can, they can tell

780
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,480
Speaker 4:  us what is actually happening. But I will come back to, we're gonna take

781
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,080
Speaker 4:  the people on the ground. We're gonna take the users, we're gonna take the

782
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,880
Speaker 4:  moderators, we're gonna take the the employees every time. And if you think

783
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,720
Speaker 4:  they're wrong, you can tell us and you can explain why they're wrong. But

784
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,840
Speaker 4:  we're not gonna stop because you've, you're running like a

785
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,800
Speaker 4:  1920s press playbook. Like whatever.

786
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,920
Speaker 4:  Like I'm, we're just gonna burn you every time. And that it's that attitude.

787
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,840
Speaker 4:  It's this aggressive posture where people are worried and

788
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,520
Speaker 4:  they're coming to reporters and saying, here are our worries. Here's the

789
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,520
Speaker 4:  communication we have received that makes us feel threatened. And Reddit's

790
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,550
Speaker 4:  response is shut up. Yeah. That's what breaks your community. And like

791
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,390
Speaker 4:  that story is easy to tell. We don't actually need your help to do it. and

792
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:08,430
Speaker 4:  I that, I think they're, they're misjudging all of that because

793
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,470
Speaker 4:  when Instagram decides to launch its lemmy clone

794
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,630
Speaker 4:  and start that drama, people will just go, when Google decides

795
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,310
Speaker 4:  crap, we need something like Reddit to exist for search to be good. Here's

796
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:25,190
Speaker 4:  a Reddit clone that will kill in five years. People will go use it. And the

797
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:29,310
Speaker 4:  danger here is this posture, I don't care. Like

798
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,590
Speaker 4:  we'll just print the line. We print the poop emoji from Twitter in every

799
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:36,310
Speaker 4:  single story. Like who cares, right? We are like, this is what we do.

800
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,510
Speaker 4:  This is what you said. We're gonna print it. Your users are gonna take a

801
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,710
Speaker 4:  very different message from that than we are. Like, we will just keep doing

802
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:46,310
Speaker 4:  journalism and I. I don't think that anybody quite understands that turn.

803
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,830
Speaker 5:  I think they understand it and they don't care.

804
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,510
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Straight up.

805
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,630
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I I think, I think for them they view this

806
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:58,230
Speaker 5:  as a relatively minor problem and something that they can just brute force

807
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:01,830
Speaker 5:  their way out of. And so they like, they, they don't care if, if

808
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,950
Speaker 5:  all of these things are are going crazy right now because they're hoping

809
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,630
Speaker 5:  okay, in a month or two it'll pass and we'll go back and hopefully now we'll

810
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:13,150
Speaker 5:  be able to sell ads because we'll have a much more predictable

811
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,470
Speaker 5:  community that we can more easily monetize. Like part of this

812
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:21,350
Speaker 5:  is taming it and getting out all of the people that would make it more

813
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,710
Speaker 5:  difficult to monetize. Yeah.

814
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,630
Speaker 4:  This is like Elon firing all of his staff. Only it's Reddit firing all of

815
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:26,470
Speaker 4:  its users. Right.

816
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:29,350
Speaker 5:  And so it's like, okay, we're just gonna get rid of all of you who makes

817
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:32,470
Speaker 5:  it more difficult for us. and I wouldn't be surprised if that's a pitch that

818
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:35,670
Speaker 5:  they're, they're doing behind closed doors because that's a pretty compelling

819
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,710
Speaker 5:  one. If you're an advertiser and you wanna like avoid risk at all costs,

820
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:42,710
Speaker 5:  Reddit right now is a su Reddit, even before this was super risky, right?

821
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,750
Speaker 5:  Because they say, no, no, not safe for work stuff here. And you would still

822
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:50,150
Speaker 5:  occasionally be like, oh, I didn't need to see that this morning. Checking

823
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:53,510
Speaker 5:  Reddit. And they can get rid of a lot of those people and have a much

824
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,870
Speaker 5:  calmer, easier to to sell, easier to

825
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:01,710
Speaker 5:  control community. and I think that's the point. I think that's

826
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,750
Speaker 5:  probably the plan is that these people will tucker themselves

827
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,190
Speaker 5:  out or they'll leave.

828
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:11,230
Speaker 6:  I totally agree with that. I don't think it was the plan. I agree with every

829
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:15,070
Speaker 6:  other part of that, but it, what seems clear to me now in retrospect

830
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:19,070
Speaker 6:  is that Reddit thought it could do this relatively

831
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,030
Speaker 6:  easily that that making these changes would cause some pain because

832
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:26,550
Speaker 6:  it always causes some pain, but that it would get through it relatively quickly.

833
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,830
Speaker 6:  Right. And then, and then Christian Sealey, the Apollo developer starts making

834
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:33,120
Speaker 6:  a lot of noise and a lot of people get angry and this just gets worse and

835
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,920
Speaker 6:  worse. And then I think at some point Steve Huffman and the executives at

836
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,360
Speaker 6:  Reddit decided the only thing to do is just rip the bandaid off. And then

837
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,320
Speaker 6:  I suspect what it seems like at any rate happened is they basically just

838
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,040
Speaker 6:  decided to like put on a bunch more bandaids and rip those off too.

839
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:52,320
Speaker 6:  That it was like, okay, this is a moment we we're gonna go from rage over

840
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,160
Speaker 6:  one thing to like just get all the rage out now. Like let's, let's have this

841
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,760
Speaker 6:  hard reset with the moderators that Reddit has had forever. It has had the,

842
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,520
Speaker 6:  the admins at Reddit and the mods at Reddit have had this contentious relationship

843
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,360
Speaker 6:  forever where the admins wish the mods would run it as a pla

844
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,760
Speaker 6:  as a platform more the way the company wants and the mods wish they got more

845
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,440
Speaker 6:  tools to run it the way that they want it. And this is Reddit like

846
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,080
Speaker 6:  Absolutely, I think you're right. Exerting its authority and saying this

847
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,000
Speaker 6:  is the hard reset and I think at some point you just have no choice

848
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,720
Speaker 6:  but to fight through it. Like I don't think Reddit wanted it to get this

849
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,960
Speaker 6:  bad, but I think at some point they looked at each other and said, well it's

850
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,000
Speaker 6:  gonna be this bad anyway. Like let's just go to war.

851
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You they can't back down at this point.

852
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This is never let a crisis go to waste. Yeah,

853
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,080
Speaker 6:  Absolutely. Yeah. I

854
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,640
Speaker 5:  Think, I think you're right though. They probably didn't intend this, but

855
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,880
Speaker 5:  now that they've got it, they're like, okay, let's lean in. Burn it to the

856
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,560
Speaker 5:  ground. The

857
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,320
Speaker 4:  Other way of saying that is that chaos is a ladder and you really wanna

858
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:52,400
Speaker 4:  find the line between the two. Like one

859
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,120
Speaker 4:  of them ends with the king being dead. Not the show being good, but the king

860
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,160
Speaker 4:  being dead. Yeah. Right. It's gonna win with the power of stories. You guys.

861
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,800
Speaker 4:  Okay. That's enough Game of Thrones on this episode of The

862
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,160
Speaker 4:  Vergecast. We're gonna take a break, we're gonna come back, we're gonna talk

863
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,080
Speaker 4:  about some gadgets. Do a little lightning round, wrap this thing up. We'll

864
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:09,400
Speaker 4:  be right back.

865
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,620
Speaker 8:  This is advertiser content brought to you by Zelle.

866
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,820
Speaker 8:  Saying no to anyone is hard. When that person's

867
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,540
Speaker 8:  a family member or one of your closest friends. It's woo, practically

868
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,500
Speaker 8:  impossible. Even when they ask things like,

869
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,220
Speaker 9:  Hey, it's your Uncle Walt. Listen, I'm locked out of my bank account and

870
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,180
Speaker 9:  I need 50 bucks stat. Can you help me out?

871
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,780
Speaker 10:  It can feel really overwhelming when family asks to borrow money.

872
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,740
Speaker 10:  I think our first instinct is always to help our family. And so we're willing

873
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,900
Speaker 10:  to do whatever it takes to make sure that they get what they need.

874
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,820
Speaker 8:  Dr. Marty Delima studies financial fraud.

875
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,300
Speaker 10:  When you get a call from a family member or maybe it seems out of the blue,

876
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,740
Speaker 10:  the first thing to do is pause. Like, how urgent is this?

877
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,980
Speaker 10:  And then always ask that person a question.

878
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,060
Speaker 10:  Only that family member would know the answer to.

879
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,540
Speaker 9:  Hello? Hey, don't forget about your Uncle Walt.

880
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,740
Speaker 8:  Oh yeah. Look, what did we have for dinner together last

881
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,620
Speaker 8:  week? Oh,

882
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:12,780
Speaker 9:  Gotta go. Goodbye.

883
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:17,180
Speaker 8:  Brought to you by Zelle. Who'd like to remind you to only send money to those

884
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,980
Speaker 8:  You know and trust Zelle is available. To United States Bank

885
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,140
Speaker 8:  account holders, only terms and conditions apply.

886
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:26,860
Speaker 5:  Support for

887
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,720
Speaker 7:  This show comes from Intel. Where do world changing ideas

888
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,800
Speaker 7:  get their start at Intel? It starts with real solutions.

889
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,960
Speaker 7:  And real solutions start with exceptional engineering.

890
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:42,880
Speaker 7:  Empowering those with disabilities starts with assistive AI

891
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,960
Speaker 7:  and discovering new galaxies starts with supercomputing.

892
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,320
Speaker 7:  The intelligent factory starts with edge analytics while the

893
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,240
Speaker 7:  sustainable supply chain starts with open manufacturing.

894
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,880
Speaker 7:  And that's just the start. The quantum computing revolution,

895
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,760
Speaker 7:  the next generation of AI experts, the renewable energy

896
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:06,800
Speaker 7:  grid, liquid cooling, data centers, early diagnosis for

897
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,200
Speaker 7:  cancer, water restoration, farmland protection.

898
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:14,480
Speaker 7:  They all start with Intel. The examples are countless,

899
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,800
Speaker 7:  the impacts are endless, but the foundation is always the same.

900
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,720
Speaker 7:  It starts with Intel. learn more at

00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:24,880
Speaker 7:  intel.com/stories.

902
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,330
Speaker 4:  We're back. We're gonna clear the air from all the social networking talk

903
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:40,810
Speaker 4:  until a little bit later. Yeah, we gotta, it's like a little

904
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:44,650
Speaker 4:  between courses. Gadget palate, cleanser, little, a little grapefruit.

905
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:48,490
Speaker 4:  When I think of amused Bouch, I think of the Google Pixel Tablet, the light

906
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,250
Speaker 4:  refreshing. Google Pixel. Tablet. I think

907
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,410
Speaker 5:  Dan would probably agree with you.

908
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:56,450
Speaker 4:  I think he would agree that it is light. Yeah, I know that. Refreshing.

909
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,890
Speaker 4:  I don't know that we've actually refreshed the Android Tablet strategy, but

910
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:03,730
Speaker 4:  Dan reviewed the Google Pixel Tablet this week. That's the Pixel Tablet

911
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,490
Speaker 4:  that has the doc that makes it look like a giant Nest hub. Yeah, it's an

912
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:07,970
Speaker 4:  Android Tablet

913
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,290
Speaker 5:  $500 Android Tablet, which

914
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,730
Speaker 6:  We should say is, is not nothing like, one of my favorite things about this

915
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:17,770
Speaker 6:  was talking to Dan through this whole process. He just kept testing

916
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:21,970
Speaker 6:  the thing and being like, Google made an Android Tablet that

917
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:25,530
Speaker 6:  is actually like a kind of good Tablet for the first time in a really long

918
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:29,490
Speaker 6:  time. Is that anything? and I. And we just kinda

919
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:32,490
Speaker 6:  were like, I, we spent the whole time he, he wrote this review and I was

920
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:36,290
Speaker 6:  editing it with him, and I was like, is this anything? Because it is. It's

921
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:39,970
Speaker 6:  a good Tablet. It's a nice device. It has a nice screen, it has decent speakers.

922
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:43,410
Speaker 6:  The doc thing seems to be really clever. There's a lot of little

923
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,290
Speaker 6:  details missing in the way that you would expect a first generation product

924
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,930
Speaker 6:  to be missing. Extra docs are too expensive. It's missing some of the smart

925
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:54,250
Speaker 6:  display stuff that people might want. But it gets most of the basics, right?

926
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:58,210
Speaker 6:  It has no big ideas about what a Tablet should be, which to some extent

927
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:02,090
Speaker 6:  I love about it. It's not, there's no like heady thesis about

928
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,930
Speaker 6:  tablets being the future of anything. It's literally deliberately just

929
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:09,050
Speaker 6:  a screen for you to look at. And sometimes you will look at it while you're

930
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:11,170
Speaker 6:  holding it and sometimes you will look at it while you're cooking in the

931
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:14,890
Speaker 6:  kitchen and it's sitting on its stock. That's the whole story. And

932
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:18,410
Speaker 6:  the thing Dan and I spent a long time talking about was how you think about

933
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,490
Speaker 6:  $500 in that context, which I'm very curious what you guys

934
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,800
Speaker 6:  think because I've gone back and forth a million times on whether this thing

935
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,280
Speaker 6:  is a good deal or not.

936
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,920
Speaker 4:  It depends on whether you think it's a tiny portable TV

937
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,120
Speaker 4:  or an iPad. That'ss how I think about it. So

938
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:39,920
Speaker 4:  iPads are very cheap. They have really good software

939
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:43,880
Speaker 4:  ecosystems. Apple will update the software every year

940
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,840
Speaker 4:  on time without fail for like a decade.

941
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:49,440
Speaker 5:  It's 329.

942
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,320
Speaker 4:  There's an ecosystem of cases. If you break an iPad screen,

943
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:57,320
Speaker 4:  you can walk into any mall kiosk in the world and get

944
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,840
Speaker 4:  a crappy replacement for that screen for not a lot of like, right? Like the

945
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,520
Speaker 4:  iPad is an ecosystem and I will just come back to this.

946
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,920
Speaker 4:  And Apple updates the software on that iPad. Apple's gonna make iPads next

947
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,320
Speaker 4:  year. Yeah. Is Google gonna make Pixel tablets next year?

948
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,560
Speaker 5:  I hope they don't make iPads next year.

949
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,680
Speaker 4:  It'd be amazing if Apple is like, eh, we're doing a Google no more iPads.

950
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:21,000
Speaker 4:  I'm just like, if you think about it as a competitor to the iPad, this thing

951
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:25,120
Speaker 4:  loses left and right for $500. You can get an iPad error,

952
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,720
Speaker 4:  a superior product to this with a documented

953
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,560
Speaker 4:  history of actual support from the company that makes it. But

954
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,000
Speaker 5:  No Doc

955
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:37,080
Speaker 4:  Tim Cook knows they make iPads. Sundar Pcha

956
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,480
Speaker 4:  ever held the Pixel, Tablet You know at this point with Google Sprawl and

957
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,680
Speaker 4:  they are narrowing it down. But like if you think about a competitor iPad,

958
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,320
Speaker 4:  like just on the merits, that's tough. That's a tough comparison. And Google

959
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,280
Speaker 4:  has a lot of baggage. If you are like, this is a TV that sits in a dock

960
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,280
Speaker 4:  and shows me my Google photos and sometimes I can turn off the air conditioner

961
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:57,960
Speaker 4:  with the smart home controls 500 bucks. Actually not so bad.

962
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:58,600
Speaker 4:  Couldn't

963
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,520
Speaker 5:  You do that with an iPad?

964
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,440
Speaker 4:  There's no, there's no iPad doc for a kitchen. That's fair. Right? Like that.

965
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,320
Speaker 4:  That's the, if this is a slightly bigger nest hub that also happens

966
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,080
Speaker 4:  to run an ecosystem of video playing apps. I

967
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The the doc's the part you, you talked David about how there's no big

968
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,280
Speaker 5:  ideas here, but the doc feels not really a big idea. We've seen

969
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,040
Speaker 5:  Lenovo and other people experiment with it, but it seems like a well executed

970
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,000
Speaker 5:  version of a very old big idea. And that's kind of exciting to

971
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,960
Speaker 5:  me because everybody kind of sucks at these docs. Yeah.

972
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,640
Speaker 5:  And this one seems to be good.

973
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,880
Speaker 6:  Yeah. One of my favorite things that Dan told me was that he has, he has

974
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,760
Speaker 6:  a magic keyboard for the iPad that he literally

975
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,680
Speaker 6:  just uses as a stand for his iPad to just dock it in and out of

976
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,640
Speaker 6:  which is also a thing that I've done, and it is the most ludicrously,

977
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:49,240
Speaker 6:  overpriced iPad stand you could possibly imagine. But for all the ecosystem

978
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,000
Speaker 6:  stuff that there is in Apple's world, there actually aren't that

979
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,920
Speaker 6:  many things. You can attach to an iPad. The, it has the little, the little

980
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:00,040
Speaker 6:  plugs on the bottom, the smart connector stuff. But that hasn't really turned

981
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:00,520
Speaker 6:  into anything.

982
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:04,320
Speaker 4:  So. we have a seventh gen iPad that we bought for Max. It was her first iPad.

983
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,120
Speaker 4:  She's on her second iPad now. Just

984
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:06,600
Speaker 5:  Flick it.

985
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:07,440
Speaker 4:  She's five.

986
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:13,120
Speaker 4:  But we still have this one line around it basically just like got too old.

987
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:16,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like I, I bought the cheapest one when she was born and then she got

988
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,760
Speaker 4:  to about three and I was like, I'm so sorry kid. Like

989
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,000
Speaker 4:  you, you deserve a reasonably fast computer. So. we just had this thing and

990
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,480
Speaker 4:  what's it there for? It's there to like show photos and I, don't know, sometimes

991
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:31,080
Speaker 4:  be a kitchen TV or whatever. and I went looking for a doc that uses the,

992
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:35,000
Speaker 4:  the smart connector on the bottom. And there are zero. Yeah, zero.

993
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,320
Speaker 4:  There's one. Logitech made it, it was called the Log Dock. They sold it for

994
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,840
Speaker 4:  like $129 and they stopped making it because it charged too slow and got

995
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,400
Speaker 4:  the iPad hot.

996
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:45,600
Speaker 6:  It's also like three inches thick for reasons I never understood.

997
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,920
Speaker 6:  But yeah, it's bad. Is

998
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,360
Speaker 5:  It like a technology thing? Like

999
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,160
Speaker 4:  No, it, I think the Smart Apple has claimed that the smart connector is open

1000
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,560
Speaker 4:  and does not require licenses. And like that

1001
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:57,800
Speaker 5:  Can't be frozen. That

1002
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,040
Speaker 6:  Does not seem to be the case. Because otherwise

1003
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,080
Speaker 5:  Belkin would have 12 Doss out there. Yeah. And they

1004
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,600
Speaker 5:  have zero.

1005
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,520
Speaker 4:  I think the reality is a smart connector might not be that great. Mm.

1006
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:09,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Right? And there's no way to test it because there's So that runs a

1007
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,440
Speaker 5:  smart connector

1008
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,920
Speaker 4:  Or the made for iPhone mafiaa.

1009
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:17,680
Speaker 4:  Like if anybody tells us the answer, like they're dead. Yeah.

1010
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:21,360
Speaker 4:  and I I would say, it's been 10 years of me asking for the story.

1011
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:24,840
Speaker 4:  I've been trying to write a story about the Made for fund program, the M

1012
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,160
Speaker 4:  F I program, and what it's like really, like for 10 years it has

1013
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:32,280
Speaker 4:  destroyed reporters. The wreckage, the human wreckage of me

1014
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,400
Speaker 4:  asking for a story about the M F I program is vast,

1015
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,600
Speaker 4:  but if you want to tell us about it,

1016
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:41,040
Speaker 6:  Several Apple employees just showed up outside the studio as you were saying

1017
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,200
Speaker 6:  that

1018
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:46,680
Speaker 4:  It is, it is the most tightly, like, we're like, we're gonna do a whole episode

1019
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,280
Speaker 4:  at H D M I and like people are like, yeah, we'll talk about that. And it's

1020
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,560
Speaker 4:  cutthroat politics. A whole episode at u s we're like, we wanna do a whole

1021
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,480
Speaker 4:  episode about M f i, about the lightning connector and like

1022
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:57,800
Speaker 4:  darkness falls.

1023
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,840
Speaker 6:  Like say that again.

1024
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:02,280
Speaker 4:  It's like erta. Look, it's not happening.

1025
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,120
Speaker 4:  But I think the smart connector is wrapped up into that. Yeah. So that's

1026
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,040
Speaker 4:  why there's no docs. There we go. Is basically the answer.

1027
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,960
Speaker 5:  I like that plan. Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah. But I will

1028
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,800
Speaker 6:  Say I am very enthusiastic about the idea of a good fancy kitchen

1029
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,480
Speaker 6:  tv. I wish this thing didn't cost $500. I think if it was like

1030
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:22,280
Speaker 6:  3 49, I would've bought one already. That

1031
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,400
Speaker 5:  That feels right.

1032
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:27,880
Speaker 6:  It's just a smidge out of the range where I can just like feel like it's

1033
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,240
Speaker 6:  an obviously good idea right now. Like I have an iPad and I can just carry

1034
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,280
Speaker 6:  it in and outta my kitchen. And that basically works fine

1035
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:35,080
Speaker 5:  Also, there's no remote for it, right?

1036
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:35,920
Speaker 4:  No,

1037
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,920
Speaker 5:  I I am firmly on.

1038
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,280
Speaker 6:  You got 10 remotes on the end of your arms. Alex.

1039
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I, I need so many remotes. You ha like

1040
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,920
Speaker 5:  you're in your kitchen, your hands are dirty. You don't wanna like dry. Like,

1041
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:52,040
Speaker 5:  I wanna like a remote that can get all grubby in my kitchen and also then

1042
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,640
Speaker 5:  be cleaned so I don't disease people

1043
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:56,160
Speaker 4:  Like throw it in the dishwasher

1044
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,800
Speaker 5:  Or wash it in the sink without electrocuting myself

1045
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:04,200
Speaker 6:  Be, this is a point in favor of the Pixel Tablet because

1046
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:08,640
Speaker 6:  Siri is garbage. And this is true. The Pixel Tablet is not, or, and Google

1047
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,520
Speaker 6:  assistant is not garbage. It's very exciting. All

1048
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,320
Speaker 4:  Right. I found you something called the Slim Seal five in one universal waterproof

1049
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:15,960
Speaker 4:  remote control.

1050
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,560
Speaker 5:  But does it work for the Google Pixel Tablet?

1051
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:22,400
Speaker 6:  It's, it's just a stylist you use to touch the Pixel Tablet.

1052
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,160
Speaker 4:  I don't, I don't like it. and I will say that Google's AI search results

1053
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,480
Speaker 4:  are like, what are you doing?

1054
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:32,800
Speaker 4:  This is the most useless ai.

1055
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:38,320
Speaker 4:  Nevermind. I'm not every now and again, I look at what AI can actually produce.

1056
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:41,280
Speaker 4:  I'm like, I'm not worried. That's how You know you're gonna be first against

1057
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,240
Speaker 4:  the wall. Look, that's the the thing about the tv Yeah. In

1058
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,720
Speaker 4:  the kitchen is like, it's what everybody wants. It's what everyone's trying

1059
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,640
Speaker 4:  to build. It's been the pinnacle of technology since the fifties. It's

1060
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:54,730
Speaker 4:  hard. And everyone's still kinda like looking at their phones. Yeah. Also,

1061
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:58,170
Speaker 4:  the, the fact that it's like Android on the backend, I don't think that processor

1062
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:01,530
Speaker 4:  is fast enough to support like fast user switching in a way that would make

1063
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:05,050
Speaker 4:  having actual Android apps in your kitchen like useful to you.

1064
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:09,090
Speaker 4:  Right? Like if this thing is actually signed into my Google account and it's

1065
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:12,170
Speaker 4:  just like sitting on the dock in the kitchen, like Android tablets are not

1066
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:16,370
Speaker 4:  swift. It's switching to my wife's account. Right. Or

1067
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:19,490
Speaker 4:  whatever. Right. And that there's just like that piece of it that I'm

1068
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,130
Speaker 5:  Worried. Why would you need that speed in the kitchen?

1069
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:25,170
Speaker 4:  Oh. Because if, at least in my world, if the other people,

1070
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:29,290
Speaker 4:  if it's not instant, it will just never be used. Right. If I was like,

1071
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:32,050
Speaker 4:  here's what I want you to do. I want you to get into the, I walk into this

1072
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:35,970
Speaker 4:  room and then to use this huge screen. I want you to push some

1073
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,250
Speaker 4:  fiddly buttons and wait and

1074
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,810
Speaker 5:  It takes like 30 seconds. No. Good.

1075
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:42,050
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But Becky's like, I'm gonna use my phone instantly without question.

1076
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:43,010
Speaker 4:  She'll use her phone's.

1077
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:46,810
Speaker 6:  But Neli I would remind you again that do You know what the iPad has in terms

1078
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,530
Speaker 6:  of multiple users? Nothing.

1079
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,690
Speaker 4:  Yeah. True. And that's why Max has had two of them

1080
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:01,690
Speaker 6:  The worst. No, I, I think like, this is one of those things that I, I sincerely

1081
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:05,010
Speaker 6:  hope Google stays at this because I think there's a, there's a version of

1082
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:08,970
Speaker 6:  this a couple of years from now that's maybe a little cheaper and

1083
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:12,810
Speaker 6:  a little better and fixes some of the little things that

1084
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:16,370
Speaker 6:  are missing, like you're talking about. And this starts to get really compelling.

1085
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:20,570
Speaker 6:  I have absolutely zero faith that that is going to happen. But I sincerely

1086
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:24,330
Speaker 6:  hope we like that. I live to see the Google Pixel Tablet

1087
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:24,690
Speaker 6:  three.

1088
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:28,290
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna like send you a sign print that says, I hope Google sticks with

1089
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:30,330
Speaker 4:  this. And you can just like hang it above your desk.

1090
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,490
Speaker 6:  Remember it'll go right next to my Rick Olow dartboard.

1091
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:38,690
Speaker 5:  Remember when there was like a 27 inch Android Tablet? Yeah. That was

1092
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:41,410
Speaker 5:  supposed to be a TV for your kitchen. Like in 2014.

1093
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:44,610
Speaker 4:  Putting a TV in your kitchen is the only dream tech industry has ever had.

1094
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,010
Speaker 5:  They suck so much at it. They can't fit in because they haven't figured up

1095
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:49,010
Speaker 6:  The waterproof remote.

1096
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,170
Speaker 5:  It's the remote. You figure that out, the rest of it'll

1097
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:54,770
Speaker 4:  Fall into place. Yeah. It's like, can we run Windows on your TV and can that

1098
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:58,690
Speaker 4:  TV live in your kitchen? And everyone's like, you've got bad ideas. No, no.

1099
01:01:58,690 --> 01:01:58,970
Speaker 4:  Thank you.

1100
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:03,890
Speaker 4:  Other Gadget News. A bunch of Vision Pro stuff is out this week. Apple officially

1101
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:07,690
Speaker 4:  released the S D K to let developers start playing with it. They're gonna

1102
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:11,370
Speaker 4:  have open developer beta zones. You, you

1103
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,970
Speaker 4:  airlift into them, you drop out and then they put a headset on your face

1104
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:16,090
Speaker 4:  and you aren't allowed to test your apps.

1105
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,730
Speaker 5:  You have to send an n d a very

1106
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:18,130
Speaker 4:  Complicated

1107
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:21,080
Speaker 6:  Process. I really like imagining that there are gonna be like planes and

1108
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,320
Speaker 6:  like You know how the O Oxygen mask drops down. Yeah. You're gonna like sit

1109
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,760
Speaker 6:  in your seat and a Vision Pro is just gonna drop down from the ceiling.

1110
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:30,720
Speaker 4:  Yes. Apple has chartered a number of sevens, 40 sevens and they will circle

1111
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:33,400
Speaker 4:  the globe letting people try the headset.

1112
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,240
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's perfect. This is true. It's all right there.

1113
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,760
Speaker 4:  The previous section was like a impassioned plea about how we make

1114
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,160
Speaker 4:  journalism. This section, I'm lying to you, is telling you that Apple's gonna

1115
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:47,080
Speaker 4:  fly developers around the world wearing headset sets to

1116
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,400
Speaker 4:  build apps. That's just the bird test. You never know what's gonna happen.

1117
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:52,760
Speaker 4:  But we've seen some apps from this S D K 'cause people have gotten it. They're

1118
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,160
Speaker 4:  able to like start building in the simulator. The simulator's very funny

1119
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,480
Speaker 4:  'cause all the apps are in like a fake living room. Like you just like look

1120
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,000
Speaker 4:  at the photos and all the screenshots are like, what if you had a beautiful

1121
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,480
Speaker 4:  living room?

1122
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,920
Speaker 5:  Do we know whose living room it

1123
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,800
Speaker 4:  Is? And that's some Apple living room. The number of beautiful fake living

1124
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,280
Speaker 4:  rooms in the Apple campus is off the charts. It really is. I

1125
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,760
Speaker 5:  Was just wondering if it's like based on anyone in particulars. Is it Tim

1126
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:14,120
Speaker 5:  Cooks

1127
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:17,000
Speaker 4:  You? It's Tim Cook's living room. Yeah. It's too small to be Tim Cook's living

1128
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,440
Speaker 4:  room. Okay. You know Tim Cook. His living room is like a gigantic, he's got

1129
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,760
Speaker 4:  a conversation of Granite.

1130
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,080
Speaker 5:  I think he's got the pit. You,

1131
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,680
Speaker 4:  You think he's Yeah. He's like step down with me. Yeah. All right. Maybe

1132
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,160
Speaker 4:  who knows.

1133
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:28,400
Speaker 5:  Big Fireplace.

1134
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:31,040
Speaker 4:  It's like, welcome, welcome. Come down, come down into my conversation.

1135
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:35,000
Speaker 6:  Step down with me is Tim Cook's memoir title. Step Down

1136
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,840
Speaker 4:  With me is very amazing. Very good. Yeah. Anyway, so we've seen the apps.

1137
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,800
Speaker 4:  The apps are pretty interesting, right? They, I saw a version of P Calc.

1138
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:44,520
Speaker 4:  I've seen a few other apps. Some interesting things we've discovered

1139
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,880
Speaker 4:  already is the, the concept of dark mode seems to make no sense

1140
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,190
Speaker 4:  in like spatial computing.

1141
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:51,230
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1142
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:55,750
Speaker 4:  And then there's two ways to get an app into the simulator. One, you can

1143
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:59,910
Speaker 4:  take an iPad app and go that way. Or you can build it in the Vision

1144
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:03,590
Speaker 4:  Pro S C K and the iPad apps are just floating

1145
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:07,710
Speaker 4:  iPad apps. I love it. It's just here they are. And the

1146
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:11,390
Speaker 4:  Vision Pro apps are like Frosted Glass. They've got depth and it's just very

1147
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:13,470
Speaker 4:  clear that like, that's how you should do it.

1148
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:17,710
Speaker 6:  I mean this is like back to when the iPad first came out and

1149
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,510
Speaker 6:  there was a thing you could do where you would just hit the two x button.

1150
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:22,950
Speaker 6:  Do you remember this? You could run an iPhone app and you would just hit

1151
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:25,270
Speaker 6:  the two X and it would blow up to size of the iPad. You can

1152
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,550
Speaker 5:  Still do that. That's

1153
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:29,110
Speaker 4:  How, that's how the majority of the people are running Instagram on their

1154
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:29,470
Speaker 4:  iPads.

1155
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:32,590
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that's, yeah, exactly. I think the Vision Pro is gonna have a long

1156
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:35,710
Speaker 6:  run of being just like that. Where it's just gonna be like, we took a rectangle.

1157
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:39,310
Speaker 6:  Here's here it is in another place. Do you like this rectangle?

1158
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:44,230
Speaker 4:  Well this is always back to Apple's initial strategy with

1159
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:47,990
Speaker 4:  anything, which is you like apps, right? Here's some apps. Yep.

1160
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:51,270
Speaker 4:  And they did it with the Mac. Remember they're like iPad apps now run on

1161
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:55,070
Speaker 4:  your Mac. If you are the person who runs iOS and

1162
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:58,830
Speaker 4:  iPad, OSS apps on your Mac natively. I would love to hear from you.

1163
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:03,230
Speaker 4:  I was so excited about this concept. and I did it once

1164
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,390
Speaker 4:  with some, like,

1165
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:07,150
Speaker 5:  I do it with my air conditioning apps. That's

1166
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:07,550
Speaker 4:  Good. Do

1167
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:11,430
Speaker 6:  You ever like imagining how many Apple engineers are employed full-time so

1168
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:15,350
Speaker 6:  that you can control your heating and cooling from your laptop?

1169
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:16,590
Speaker 5:  I suspect it's one

1170
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:18,840
Speaker 4:  Also. You should do that in the home app.

1171
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:23,480
Speaker 5:  No, it doesn't work. It doesn't work with Home Kit, HomeKit or Home

1172
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,680
Speaker 5:  Assistant. I'm working through it. Madea, call me.

1173
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:29,440
Speaker 6:  You have to move. Oh, Alex. That's the only answer. Yeah, it's time to

1174
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,200
Speaker 4:  Move other Vision Pro News. The information has a report that they didn't

1175
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,640
Speaker 4:  show us everything. There are fitness features, which we haven't been talking

1176
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,120
Speaker 4:  about since we came on. We knew it. It will guide users through yoga and

1177
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:40,680
Speaker 4:  Tai Chi.

1178
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:43,000
Speaker 5:  So like crummy, supernatural.

1179
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:44,000
Speaker 4:  Do a kick.

1180
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:49,920
Speaker 6:  That's how what Tai chi is. Neli Neli. Can you just, can you just do a, do

1181
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,320
Speaker 6:  some Tai chi for us right now real quick, just for a couple minutes.

1182
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:54,520
Speaker 4:  Do a cake.

1183
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:56,120
Speaker 5:  It's also yoga.

1184
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:00,920
Speaker 4:  Wave your arms around, do cakes

1185
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:05,640
Speaker 4:  apparently. And that let you interact with content on a stationary bike.

1186
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:08,600
Speaker 6:  Is it weird that I'm very excited about that specifically. Like for some

1187
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,960
Speaker 6:  reason in, in this very good informational report, that was the thing that

1188
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,520
Speaker 6:  jumped out to me is like, oh, I would use that. I

1189
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,760
Speaker 5:  Mean, if they do it well, that would be really cool.

1190
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:20,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like I often, the only way I will ever use a treadmill

1191
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:24,160
Speaker 6:  or a stationary bike is if I can also watch a television program because

1192
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,960
Speaker 6:  otherwise God helped me. And so I'm, I'm the guy who like brings my iPad

1193
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,880
Speaker 6:  to the gym and just sets it up in front of me and like watches the league

1194
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:34,880
Speaker 6:  for an hour while I run on the treadmill. Or stand on the treadmill and watch

1195
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,560
Speaker 6:  the league. And, and the idea of having a headset, it's kind of like the,

1196
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:41,840
Speaker 6:  the plane example, right? It's this, it's this very sort of specific

1197
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:46,200
Speaker 6:  episodic thing where I would very much like to not be here. and I can totally

1198
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,400
Speaker 6:  see why something like that would make a lot of sense on a stationary bike.

1199
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,800
Speaker 6:  I'd be very into that. Yeah,

1200
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:54,240
Speaker 4:  But you're still on the bike. The part that sucks is being on the bike.

1201
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:58,320
Speaker 5:  That's the problem. I like resent it. Like I was trying to watch

1202
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,120
Speaker 5:  Ted lasso one day on the stationary bike and I was just like, on this bike.

1203
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,640
Speaker 5:  I could be watching this on the couch. It's just right over there.

1204
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:09,680
Speaker 4:  Stupid moving, stupid moving. Well look, here's what I'm saying. Do

1205
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,880
Speaker 4:  a kick. Have you thought about kicking more?

1206
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,160
Speaker 5:  Do a gentle kick.

1207
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:17,120
Speaker 4:  I, I think we all agree that this is one of the killer

1208
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:21,040
Speaker 4:  apps for these devices. I don't know how I feel about riding a

1209
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,240
Speaker 4:  stationary bike with a wired battery pack in my pocket.

1210
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:28,280
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Or mounted to the bike in some way. Getting

1211
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,080
Speaker 5:  All hot and sweaty. Oh, gross. And then the ba ugh,

1212
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:32,960
Speaker 4:  Gross. Just kick that right off your body.

1213
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,200
Speaker 5:  You're definitely not sharing that headset with other people.

1214
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:40,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Gross. But you can see that there's an expansive vision

1215
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:43,640
Speaker 4:  for this. I think the fact that they, that, I mean we know that they release

1216
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,560
Speaker 4:  a wwc so developers could get into it. The fact that the s D K is out

1217
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,120
Speaker 4:  so quickly afterwards and that people will beginning to use it well before

1218
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:55,040
Speaker 4:  it actually launches next year. There is an amount of confidence in

1219
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:58,920
Speaker 4:  this device that I think is fascinating. It's, I still, the more

1220
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,960
Speaker 4:  I think about it, every time I think about it, I think of that picture of

1221
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,320
Speaker 4:  the guy taking a picture of his kids wearing a headset. That's

1222
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,120
Speaker 5:  The use case.

1223
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:08,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah. There, there's a version of this where they're already

1224
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,840
Speaker 4:  assuming people are bought into wearing the headset and they're gonna do

1225
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:14,360
Speaker 4:  all the things in the headset. And it's like no. Step one

1226
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:19,240
Speaker 4:  they gotta put on the headset. Like you gotta tell them something amazing

1227
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:22,320
Speaker 4:  is gonna happen in that headset before they put it on.

1228
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:25,680
Speaker 6:  Which is why fitness is so powerful. Like fitness is the reason wearables

1229
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,200
Speaker 6:  worked because people will put things on their body to track their health

1230
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:28,920
Speaker 6:  and fitness. I

1231
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,600
Speaker 5:  Was gonna say it's the reason the Meta headset has done Yeah. Or one of the

1232
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,480
Speaker 5:  reasons. Yeah. I just

1233
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:36,400
Speaker 6:  Started doing Supernatural again. The boxing absolutely kicks my ass

1234
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,400
Speaker 6:  every single time. But it's so

1235
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:40,160
Speaker 5:  Fun. You're like, oh, it's only 10 minutes, whatever. And then you're like,

1236
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:40,680
Speaker 5:  fuck. Just

1237
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,080
Speaker 6:  Wrecked at the end. Yeah, it's

1238
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:42,800
Speaker 5:  Great. I love it.

1239
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,240
Speaker 4:  Speaking of do a kick. There's, there's kicks in supernatural boxing.

1240
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:49,280
Speaker 4:  Literally there's like, it's like I'm gonna kick it and you kick it. It's

1241
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,160
Speaker 4:  great. It's perfect.

1242
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,040
Speaker 5:  Do that Vision pro. Yeah.

1243
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:56,640
Speaker 4:  I Well it sounds like they will only, you'll get a calming apple voice.

1244
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:59,360
Speaker 4:  It's gonna be great. It's gonna be Johnny, I, I

1245
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,160
Speaker 5:  Think Don't wanna watch you do

1246
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:04,040
Speaker 4:  Tai Chi. I will buy a vision pro if you guarantee me that Johnny i's voice

1247
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:04,960
Speaker 4:  will be like, do a kick.

1248
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:12,240
Speaker 4:  You want me to wear the headset? I'll wear the headset. It's

1249
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,360
Speaker 4:  ridiculous. But yeah, I think that's where fitness comes in. I think where

1250
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,840
Speaker 4:  that's where this other stuff comes in. But the, I think Apple, like Apple's

1251
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,960
Speaker 4:  entire approach to this is like, they've skipped the first step of like,

1252
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,520
Speaker 4:  why you won't put this on. We'll see, we got a long way to go. More

1253
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:29,400
Speaker 4:  news out of our friends in Europe. You know they're, they just keep passing

1254
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:30,560
Speaker 4:  laws over there. I

1255
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,280
Speaker 5:  Love them. I God bless 'em.

1256
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,760
Speaker 4:  Well, so this one is tough. Barbara wrote about this. She's super into it.

1257
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,960
Speaker 4:  A new regulation that will say phone batteries have to be easily replaceable.

1258
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:42,680
Speaker 4:  Makes sense. This is like we've covered every twist and turn of the phone

1259
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,760
Speaker 4:  battery story. Apple got into a lot of trouble for actually

1260
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:49,880
Speaker 4:  throttling its phones. As the batteries got older. A to a

1261
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,160
Speaker 4:  justified reason. Maybe you gotta tell people you're doing it a lot of trouble

1262
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:56,120
Speaker 4:  for that. They've launched a battery repair program. They've launched all

1263
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,720
Speaker 4:  these repair programs due to regulations around the country and the world.

1264
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:03,680
Speaker 4:  And now we're at actually just from the beginning, you have to make the battery

1265
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:07,200
Speaker 4:  replaceable. Yeah. This is pretty huge implications for iPhones were designed.

1266
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:07,600
Speaker 4:  Yes.

1267
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:11,360
Speaker 6:  And we should say it hasn't been passed. It seems very likely it's going

1268
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,280
Speaker 6:  to, the initial vote was, I think, let's see, Barbara said

1269
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,880
Speaker 6:  587 votes in favor. Nine against and 20 abstentions.

1270
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,240
Speaker 6:  Like it's a pretty strong majority. But the thing I think is most interesting

1271
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:25,000
Speaker 6:  about this is the, the phrase that it uses is that portable batteries

1272
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,960
Speaker 6:  have to be designed quote in such a way that consumers can themselves easily

1273
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:32,880
Speaker 6:  remove and replace them. And the phrase easily remove and replace

1274
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:36,600
Speaker 6:  is in bold. And you can just tell this was so carefully

1275
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,720
Speaker 6:  worded so that you can't get out of it by saying, okay, we'll make it easy

1276
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:43,520
Speaker 6:  to go to the Apple store and replace it. Or a third party manufacturer.

1277
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:47,240
Speaker 6:  It means no, a human being needs to be able to open up their phone,

1278
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:51,680
Speaker 6:  remove their battery, and put in a new one like that couldn't, that is clearly

1279
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,320
Speaker 6:  the outcome they're looking for here. and I think that's really fascinating.

1280
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,240
Speaker 5:  Couldn't Apple argue that they can do that now?

1281
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,340
Speaker 6:  No. No. You can't argue that someone could remove the battery from their

1282
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:01,820
Speaker 6:  office. Oh my

1283
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:05,620
Speaker 5:  God. I love when you pull the, the adhesive in there. Yeah. Very slow,

1284
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,300
Speaker 5:  most satisfying thing in the world.

1285
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:10,060
Speaker 4:  It's, it's like the way that phones are designed and structured

1286
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:10,740
Speaker 5:  Right?

1287
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,880
Speaker 4:  Are the batteries are actually in many cases now, like a component of the

1288
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,800
Speaker 4:  structure of the phone. Yeah. Okay. Like all that's gotta change. 'cause

1289
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,040
Speaker 4:  now you can just like take it out. I don't think we're gonna go back to plastic

1290
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:24,720
Speaker 4:  tab batteries that pop out when you drop the phone. I missed this and you

1291
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,960
Speaker 4:  might still have to be, be able to unscrew the phone. We'll see. I this is,

1292
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:28,120
Speaker 4:  it

1293
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,160
Speaker 5:  Would make the phone thicker.

1294
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,680
Speaker 4:  It would make the phone thicker. Potentially,

1295
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,600
Speaker 5:  Potentially affect waterproofing.

1296
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:36,680
Speaker 4:  Well, it, it really just depends on like where, where the connector for

1297
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,480
Speaker 4:  the battery is. Is it outside? Is it exposed or is it still

1298
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,720
Speaker 4:  inside the case and you just unscrew the case? I think if it, it comes down

1299
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,480
Speaker 4:  to you can remove two screws in the bottom of your phone, pop up in your

1300
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,200
Speaker 4:  phone, swap out the battery with a weird little connector that's pretty delicate

1301
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:51,920
Speaker 4:  and you screw your phone back together

1302
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,640
Speaker 5:  And then they get all the money from everybody bringing it in because they

1303
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,160
Speaker 5:  broke the delicate connector. Yeah. Boom. It's easily

1304
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,640
Speaker 5:  replaceable. You just suck.

1305
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:04,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think we're gonna hear Apple go to war against this. Yeah. Like

1306
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:08,480
Speaker 4:  they like didn't go to war against U S P C. You know.

1307
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:12,000
Speaker 4:  They're like, oh no, we have to use a connector. We designed like,

1308
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:12,760
Speaker 5:  Ooh,

1309
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:16,200
Speaker 4:  If you don't know Apple basically design the S P C connector. It's like a

1310
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,720
Speaker 4:  real thing. Fine. They're like, we don't wanna do it, but we, we get it.

1311
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:23,520
Speaker 4:  We're already put in iPads. This is like, they're You're gonna blow up the

1312
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,560
Speaker 4:  phone market. Yeah.

1313
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:28,200
Speaker 5:  How many, how many Apple lawyers are currently in route

1314
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:29,400
Speaker 5:  to the eu?

1315
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:34,160
Speaker 4:  Seven 40 sevens full of lawyers in that sense. Just going,

1316
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:36,960
Speaker 4:  getting over there. All right. Let's do a little bit of lightning round.

1317
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,840
Speaker 4:  Let's wrap this thing up. Here's my lightning round one. I wanna talk about

1318
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,720
Speaker 4:  this Gary Vaynerchuk interview on decoder. So I interviewed Gary Vanner.

1319
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:43,080
Speaker 4:  We're

1320
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,400
Speaker 5:  Gonna allow you to talk about decoder because you're using it as your lightning.

1321
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:46,640
Speaker 5:  David

1322
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,200
Speaker 4:  Said, I'm allowed to do D V D liner notes for decoder on the Vergecast.

1323
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I just wanted, I just want you to know though, this is two weeks in

1324
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,560
Speaker 6:  a row that you have talked about this on The Vergecast and, and I'm outraged.

1325
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:58,040
Speaker 4:  Well, look, I'm the person who's always like the Phish never talk about the

1326
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,240
Speaker 4:  water. Like this is like a phrase use all the time. and I just did it to

1327
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:03,840
Speaker 4:  myself. Because if you have been in ad supported media for a decade,

1328
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,160
Speaker 4:  you are aware that VaynerMedia is a gigantic ad

1329
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:12,080
Speaker 4:  agency that basically invented the concept

1330
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:15,480
Speaker 4:  of like social marketing. Like the brands are at again,

1331
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:20,120
Speaker 4:  is the thing that VaynerMedia like dragged into existence.

1332
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:20,520
Speaker 4:  Thank

1333
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,600
Speaker 5:  You guys. It's not

1334
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,880
Speaker 4:  Whatever it is, it's just true. I'm not saying

1335
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,280
Speaker 6:  Without Gary, Uck the phrase, sir. This is a Wendy's may not exist

1336
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:32,600
Speaker 4:  Any other, their clients are like real clients like Pepsi and TikTok and

1337
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,400
Speaker 4:  what, like huge car companies or like VaynerMedia clients. So this is something

1338
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:40,280
Speaker 4:  I just like know because they're, they're just, I work in ad supported

1339
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:43,960
Speaker 4:  media. I'm aware of ad agencies. I, it's a thing. Our

1340
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,120
Speaker 4:  audience does not know this. and I completely forgot that this thing that

1341
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,840
Speaker 4:  is just like baked into my job of like knowing what ad

1342
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,960
Speaker 4:  agencies are. It's like obviously nobody they know the N F T guy and I forgot

1343
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:58,640
Speaker 4:  to like say it out loud. Like, yes, I think that, I think it

1344
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,200
Speaker 4:  is. Anyone confused about how I feel about NFTs?

1345
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:03,120
Speaker 5:  How, how do you feel about them? They're

1346
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:03,320
Speaker 4:  Dumb.

1347
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:09,000
Speaker 4:  Look, what do you want from me? I think they're dumb. I I, we called them

1348
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:13,040
Speaker 4:  scams for the whole time of N F T summer. Great. The thing I'm

1349
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,480
Speaker 4:  interested in is the end of the social web and the fact that being

1350
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,440
Speaker 4:  a content creator on a social platform is a fundamentally

1351
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:24,480
Speaker 4:  tenuous and hard way to earn a living. And all the big, the biggest

1352
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:28,480
Speaker 4:  creators in the world, they hit a point of their fame and they pivot to

1353
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,480
Speaker 4:  something more stable,

1354
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,750
Speaker 5:  Like fighting other people in a cage, like

1355
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:36,950
Speaker 4:  Legitimately fighting other people in a cage. Yeah. Fake

1356
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:40,390
Speaker 4:  boxing is a more stable career than being a YouTuber.

1357
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:45,150
Speaker 4:  That's weird. Right? Selling. Well stay with the Paul brothers. Selling

1358
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,350
Speaker 4:  prime energy drinks is a more stable career than being a

1359
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:53,030
Speaker 4:  YouTuber. We weird, just weird outcomes left and right.

1360
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:57,310
Speaker 4:  You just go down the list. The Demilio sisters are selling shoes.

1361
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:01,910
Speaker 4:  I think it's because their dad used to be a shoe guy, but like they've pivoted

1362
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:05,350
Speaker 4:  to and they're like, we're gonna innovate in the footwear space. And you

1363
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:09,310
Speaker 4:  just listen to that sentence and you're like, but why are you

1364
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:12,750
Speaker 4:  doing that? And it's because it's a more stable business. And then you see

1365
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,710
Speaker 4:  what's happening with a lot the platforms and all the change. And so my interest

1366
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:20,110
Speaker 4:  is, oh, I want to go talk to the person who makes the platform's money.

1367
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:24,430
Speaker 4:  So when we talk about Facebook's revenue or toss revenue, it comes

1368
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:28,070
Speaker 4:  from companies advertising on those platforms and an ad

1369
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:31,510
Speaker 4:  agency sit in the middle of those transactions. So Facebook makes money because

1370
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:35,390
Speaker 4:  ad agencies like publicists or whatever, spend money on

1371
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:38,430
Speaker 4:  Facebook on behalf of their big clients. VaynerMedia invented a bunch of

1372
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:41,590
Speaker 4:  this stuff and I just forgot to say it out loud. So I, I know people are

1373
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:44,550
Speaker 4:  mad at me about this interview and maybe I should have had him arrested on

1374
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:48,510
Speaker 4:  site. Maybe that's how you feel like Gary Huck. But the

1375
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:51,750
Speaker 4:  thing that's interesting to me is like, here's the company and here's a person

1376
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:55,680
Speaker 4:  who mastered that moment and his view

1377
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,520
Speaker 4:  on where it's going. It's super interesting. If you think the moment is ending,

1378
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:02,360
Speaker 4:  which I do, he's at can this week, the big ad agency

1379
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:06,760
Speaker 4:  thing in France, and he's giving speeches on stage.

1380
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,400
Speaker 4:  They're like, ai, we're gonna ruin our creative with ai.

1381
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:14,880
Speaker 4:  That's the part of him that I think you don't see where he talks to his people

1382
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:18,400
Speaker 4:  on the ad agency side. Like I said, I I wish I'd reframed this interview.

1383
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:21,120
Speaker 4:  David and I have been talking about it since it came out. Like, oh, I just

1384
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:25,080
Speaker 4:  forgot to say the thing. I know. Yeah. Like, not everybody thinks about

1385
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,000
Speaker 4:  a ad agencies as often as I do.

1386
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:30,800
Speaker 6:  I mean the, yeah. Gary contains multitudes. He's a, he's a complicated dude.

1387
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:31,400
Speaker 6:  I think n

1388
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,240
Speaker 4:  Ft suck by the way. I I don't wanna be like,

1389
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:37,600
Speaker 6:  And he, I'll say he does not make a compelling case for NFTs. He makes a

1390
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,360
Speaker 6:  compelling case for creating cool collectibles that people want.

1391
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:45,560
Speaker 6:  Why those need to be digital things on the blockchain. Dunno. But I just

1392
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:45,720
Speaker 6:  wanna say

1393
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:46,600
Speaker 5:  It's faster and cheaper.

1394
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,760
Speaker 6:  I is it, I'm not even sure that's true. It's just worse

1395
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:54,840
Speaker 6:  is the only thing I know for sure. But the, the one thing I wanna say, people

1396
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,360
Speaker 6:  should listen to the episode. It's it however you feel about Gary v It's,

1397
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,200
Speaker 6:  it's a really interesting episode, but he says this one thing to you and

1398
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:03,880
Speaker 6:  Eli that has really stuck out to me. You're basically talking about kind

1399
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:07,120
Speaker 6:  of where to go on platforms and he's just ruthless about it. He's basically

1400
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,560
Speaker 6:  like, I go where the attention is. I I have no other metrics. I wanna be

1401
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,040
Speaker 6:  where people are. And you essentially are basically asking about

1402
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:18,160
Speaker 6:  how to sort of monetize as an influencer and what, whether you should worry

1403
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:22,120
Speaker 6:  when one goes away or just go where the attention is. And he says

1404
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:25,240
Speaker 6:  that would be like saying running commercials on Seinfeld is not sustainable.

1405
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:29,440
Speaker 6:  No shit. Once it hasn't got the attention you have to move on. Like that's

1406
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,840
Speaker 6:  just, it, like done just ruthless. It's like I will go where people are and

1407
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,680
Speaker 6:  when people go somewhere else, I don't care where it is. I'll be there too.

1408
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:35,520
Speaker 6:  That's the internet.

1409
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:38,880
Speaker 4:  That's the internet. But it's also to me, that's why I keep saying like,

1410
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:42,560
Speaker 4:  the influencers aren't making money. Like being the most famous TikTok is

1411
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,200
Speaker 4:  not a great business. It's certainly not like long-term

1412
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:49,920
Speaker 4:  sustainable. It'll, it'll burn you the hell out. Like all these platforms

1413
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:53,800
Speaker 4:  rewards scale. I was talking to James Vincent today about just

1414
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:57,200
Speaker 4:  AI and what it's gonna do to the web. And what we were talking about is,

1415
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:01,080
Speaker 4:  if you are a YouTuber and you make four perfect YouTube

1416
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,920
Speaker 4:  videos a year, you're not gonna make it.

1417
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,840
Speaker 4:  If you make two crappy YouTube videos a day with garish YouTube

1418
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:12,400
Speaker 4:  thumbnails, you're probably on your way to success. One of those things is

1419
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,720
Speaker 4:  gonna burn you out instantly. Immediately. Like no question every YouTuber

1420
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,640
Speaker 4:  will tell you it will. Doug Demaro, one of my favorite YouTubers, what's

1421
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,280
Speaker 4:  he pivoting towards? Cars and bids. What's cars and bids in the big investment

1422
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:26,200
Speaker 4:  in cars and bids allowing him to do right now, expand the number of hosts

1423
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,080
Speaker 4:  on his channel. He's still gonna make as many videos. He's the first person

1424
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,400
Speaker 4:  to tell you. But like he's, he's spreading out the workload

1425
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:36,640
Speaker 4:  to make the amount of content that YouTube demands of him. That's just a

1426
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,000
Speaker 4:  weird place to be. So you listen to Vayner Chuck's approach,

1427
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:44,400
Speaker 4:  he's not trying to monetize the content. He's trying to put ads

1428
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:48,960
Speaker 4:  near attention and that's the internet. Like, that's how all the platforms

1429
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,520
Speaker 4:  are monetized. They are ruthless. And so I I just think there's a turn in

1430
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,560
Speaker 4:  there where it's like, if you don't know where the money's going, you actually

1431
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,240
Speaker 4:  don't, you're not gonna have an understanding of how the next

1432
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,520
Speaker 4:  platform shift will happen. Again, I forgot to say this out

1433
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:06,240
Speaker 4:  loud. Wish I had said this all out loud, but that's the

1434
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:10,120
Speaker 4:  impetus of this. And You know I every day we will, we will strive

1435
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,840
Speaker 4:  to be better. But that's, to me it's, I I really think we're at this like

1436
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,360
Speaker 4:  crazy moment in the social web and talking to the people who built it

1437
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,280
Speaker 4:  involves talking to the marketers who have built it because they're the money.

1438
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:25,760
Speaker 4:  Like we, they have been You know that What's the saying? If the thing

1439
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,200
Speaker 4:  is, if you're not paying for it, you're the product. Yeah. We're the, they're

1440
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,320
Speaker 4:  the ones buying the product. and I, there's just something in there that

1441
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,280
Speaker 4:  I think is like, are they ready for this? Is is that world ready for this

1442
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,280
Speaker 4:  too? I'll tell you one other quick story and Then we can move on to the next

1443
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,120
Speaker 4:  sliding round. This is the longest sliding round Entry in history. I was

1444
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:44,520
Speaker 4:  the C m O of a gigantic financial services company.

1445
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:48,920
Speaker 4:  And we were talking about the whole Bud Light kerfuffle. And the worry

1446
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:53,240
Speaker 4:  is that the internet has pushed marketers towards ultra targeted

1447
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:57,080
Speaker 4:  advertising. That's what internet platforms sell ultra targeted advertising.

1448
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:00,600
Speaker 4:  You're gonna make a piece of creative to sell Bud Light. You're gonna go

1449
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:04,480
Speaker 4:  find an audience for that creative that because that has been

1450
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:08,040
Speaker 4:  precisely targeted to them, they're gonna be more likely to buy Bud Light

1451
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:11,960
Speaker 4:  and then next to them, what is constantly happening is total context collapse

1452
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:15,680
Speaker 4:  where like the precisely targeted thing becomes a cultural war issue in some

1453
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:19,400
Speaker 4:  other way. And so just the way that people are thinking about even

1454
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,320
Speaker 4:  that, like the main thing you sell targeted advertising is, oh

1455
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:27,160
Speaker 4:  boy, there's danger here that we weren't aware of because of the politics

1456
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,320
Speaker 4:  of the country. Yeah. What are you gonna do when targeted advertising is

1457
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,880
Speaker 4:  no longer the good idea? Right? Like, is that a story? I don't know. But

1458
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:37,800
Speaker 4:  it's boring. It was boring just saying it out loud just now, but like,

1459
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:42,560
Speaker 4:  I'm just like that whole thing that this whole like apparatus of the

1460
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,400
Speaker 4:  social internet is straining under the weight and like I

1461
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,960
Speaker 4:  I, I personally think I can do a better job explaining why I'm interested

1462
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:53,640
Speaker 4:  in talking to people who built it. But when they change and when that money

1463
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,120
Speaker 4:  moves, these companies are gonna shift like that overnight to combat sports.

1464
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The way the platforms work are is gonna change overnight. They're gonna

1465
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,760
Speaker 4:  shift to combat sports and everything's gonna be fine. All right. Alex,

1466
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:04,720
Speaker 4:  it's throw lightning round one

1467
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:08,520
Speaker 5:  Microsoft who's just a whittle baby. Yeah. They just, they, they're so

1468
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:12,520
Speaker 5:  ineffectual and they're so small and tiny. They are increasing

1469
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:16,360
Speaker 5:  the price of Xbox Game Pass and the Xbox Series

1470
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,840
Speaker 5:  X, not in the United States, been in a whole bunch of other places, including

1471
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,480
Speaker 5:  the uk. So naturally our, our resident Britt

1472
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:27,280
Speaker 5:  Tom Warren wrote all about it. The price is going up a little bit for the

1473
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:30,960
Speaker 5:  Xbox Series X and then it's about a dollar for

1474
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:34,760
Speaker 5:  Game Pass. It's kind of weird because how they're changing the prices.

1475
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:39,160
Speaker 5:  So if you have never subscribed to Xbox Game Pass, you've

1476
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:43,080
Speaker 5:  gotta do it before July 6th to like avoid

1477
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:46,120
Speaker 5:  the, the price hike immediately. That's when the price hike goes in for new

1478
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,440
Speaker 5:  customers. And then if you're a current customer, you don't have to deal

1479
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:53,120
Speaker 5:  with the price hike until August 13th. And people are kind of upset. They're

1480
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:57,080
Speaker 5:  a little bummed. But Microsoft is in telegraphing this for

1481
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:01,000
Speaker 5:  a while now. Yeah. And this is all happening the exact same week that they

1482
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,960
Speaker 5:  are going to court with the F T C over whether or not they can acquire Activision.

1483
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:09,280
Speaker 5:  And part of that fight is that they have to say that they suck and that

1484
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:13,080
Speaker 5:  they should totally be allowed to buy this company because they're

1485
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,160
Speaker 5:  terrible and they suck and, and they're the worst in the world. And so they

1486
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:20,040
Speaker 5:  said that they were lost the cons wars, which I think is a

1487
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:24,000
Speaker 5:  massive, massive thing to drop into a legal dock. Even

1488
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:27,760
Speaker 5:  if it's like just to win a fight. I feel like that's gonna

1489
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:29,960
Speaker 5:  have some lasting impact for the company.

1490
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:32,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We'll see what happens in this trial.

1491
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:37,680
Speaker 5:  It's, yeah, it's ongoing. It's like five days. Yeah. Today was day one.

1492
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:41,040
Speaker 5:  Tom has been covering all of it. There's a really great stream. You should

1493
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,800
Speaker 5:  totally go watch it, read it. 'cause he's just giving minute by minute updates

1494
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:48,960
Speaker 5:  and it's, it's wild. But for the most part they're, they are really aggressively

1495
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,200
Speaker 5:  being like, we suck the most.

1496
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:55,040
Speaker 4:  We're just babies. Yeah. We've lost the console battle. Yeah. I don't know

1497
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,800
Speaker 4:  how this is gonna shake out. You know, obviously there's this trial, it'll

1498
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,680
Speaker 4:  go one way or another. There's in the UK the

1499
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,600
Speaker 4:  competition Markets authority there has already said no dice. Yep. It feels

1500
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,400
Speaker 4:  like Microsoft should walk away. It

1501
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:11,440
Speaker 5:  It does. It's a little perplexing that they keep going for it. 'cause

1502
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,280
Speaker 5:  it seems like it's not gonna work in a lot of places. And how does that work?

1503
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:17,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Do you just stop operating in those countries when they say no, you

1504
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:21,400
Speaker 5:  can't acquire it here? Like, do you make a ton of little splinter companies?

1505
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:25,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's just messy. And, but I think both sides really want this

1506
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,720
Speaker 5:  to happen. They want it to happen because they've been on a buying spree

1507
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:32,040
Speaker 5:  for the last few years buying every single gaming company. So they want it

1508
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,880
Speaker 5:  to happen. And then Activision wants it to happen because everybody hates

1509
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:36,240
Speaker 5:  Activision.

1510
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,360
Speaker 4:  They would like to stop being Activision. Yeah. Although they

1511
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:42,160
Speaker 6:  Get $3 billion if the deal falls apart. So it's a That's true. It's a good

1512
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,440
Speaker 6:  spot to be in for Activision. Either way,

1513
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:47,560
Speaker 4:  I would just remind everyone, I'm not saying this is the same at all, but

1514
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,560
Speaker 4:  remember what at t was gonna buy T-Mobile, do you remember this? And the

1515
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,240
Speaker 4:  government stopped it. It's a real thing that happened. And T-Mobile walked

1516
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,200
Speaker 4:  away with a breakup fee and then became T-Mobile

1517
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:56,600
Speaker 5:  And then bought Sprint

1518
01:23:56,910 --> 01:24:00,240
Speaker 4:  Less good. Remember when our nation had four wireless carriers and now we're

1519
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,800
Speaker 4:  down to three in Dish Network? Different times.

1520
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,320
Speaker 4:  A little competition goes a long way. All right, David, what's your landing

1521
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:07,560
Speaker 4:  round?

1522
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:11,240
Speaker 6:  Mine's very quick. 'cause both the all just took forever, which is just that

1523
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:15,240
Speaker 6:  the TikTok C E O of v Pappas is leaving the company, which is a big deal

1524
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:19,160
Speaker 6:  because they are kind of the American figurehead

1525
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:23,320
Speaker 6:  of TikTok for a minute it was Kevin Mayer who was gonna be the

1526
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,360
Speaker 6:  American figurehead. That was a hilarious disaster. He

1527
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:31,160
Speaker 6:  basically like took one look around the room and was like, nevermind. And

1528
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:34,760
Speaker 6:  so v has been the COO and the, the c e o had,

1529
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:39,280
Speaker 6:  shuchu has been more visible in recent months, but

1530
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:43,120
Speaker 6:  v leaving is a, is a big deal. and I think continues to be

1531
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:47,280
Speaker 6:  more and more evidence that TikTok is not going to get its way and

1532
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:51,120
Speaker 6:  be a happy company in the United States for very long. I cannot

1533
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,840
Speaker 6:  imagine being the like American symbol of TikTok is a

1534
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,480
Speaker 6:  particularly fun job. And so I'm not super shocked, but it is yet another

1535
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:02,920
Speaker 6:  bad sign if you're a person watching to see how TikTok fairs in the United States.

1536
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:07,040
Speaker 4:  So TikTok, c e o showed Chu sent an email to the company saying V Poppas

1537
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,760
Speaker 4:  was leaving. And then the spin is, don't worry, we've

1538
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:14,560
Speaker 4:  hired 20 year Disney Zenia MUA to

1539
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,280
Speaker 4:  join the company in the new role of TOS Chief brand and Communications officer.

1540
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:18,760
Speaker 4:  Which

1541
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:19,800
Speaker 6:  Is not the same thing.

1542
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,280
Speaker 5:  Not very different.

1543
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:26,400
Speaker 4:  And you can, it's like where's the challenge? The challenge is talking about

1544
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,960
Speaker 4:  what TikTok is to a bunch of senators. Yeah. Not operating

1545
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:33,440
Speaker 4:  TikTok rough. Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna try to get all these people at the

1546
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,320
Speaker 4:  Code conference, by the way. Including our friend Steve Huffman.

1547
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:36,920
Speaker 6:  There you

1548
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:40,640
Speaker 4:  Go. He can correct us in person. But I, I agree with you, David. I think

1549
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:44,640
Speaker 4:  the, the, the signs are ominous. I would say around TikTok right now.

1550
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,040
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Agreed. The vibes

1551
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,240
Speaker 4:  Are bad. I don't think Project Texas is gonna go, we're

1552
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,520
Speaker 6:  About to hit a presidential campaign and I think this is about to flare up

1553
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:55,400
Speaker 6:  again in a pretty big way. and I suspect v among other people saw

1554
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,440
Speaker 6:  the writing on the wall on that one.

1555
01:25:56,940 --> 01:26:00,760
Speaker 4:  One last lightning round. I wanna end on a high note. Okay. DP review.

1556
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Got purchased by Gear Patrol. Yeah, it's gonna live.

1557
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:08,640
Speaker 4:  That's good. And we, we, I, we love that site. We love the work they

1558
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,560
Speaker 4:  do. I'm very happy about that weird, weird behavior from Amazon trying to

1559
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,000
Speaker 4:  shut it down before selling it for what I assume is just like nothing to

1560
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:18,840
Speaker 4:  Gear Patrol, which is happy to take it in the right home for it. But

1561
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:21,600
Speaker 4:  good, it's

1562
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:25,240
Speaker 6:  Good. DP review is great. If you are a camera nerd, it's probably already

1563
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:28,800
Speaker 6:  your favorite website. If you're not a camera nerd, go and you will become

1564
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,160
Speaker 6:  a camera nerd. You will.

1565
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:33,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'll get that Rico one day. Yeah. PR three. Ooh.

1566
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:34,760
Speaker 4:  It's pretty, it's

1567
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:35,080
Speaker 5:  So pretty.

1568
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:38,240
Speaker 4:  Alright, we're gonna go and shop for cameras. That's it. That's The Vergecast

1569
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:42,960
Speaker 4:  Wednesday. Like I said, we'll have full coverage of this Microsoft trial

1570
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,240
Speaker 4:  that has literally been going on in the background while we're taping. There's

1571
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:50,000
Speaker 4:  a live stream on the site. Tom has been covering it like as it goes.

1572
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:53,840
Speaker 4:  We'll have lots of analysis that's all happening. Look at the site. The Verge

1573
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:56,880
Speaker 4:  dot com. If you don't remember what it is, you are this far into the Vergecast

1574
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,040
Speaker 4:  You know, that's The Verge sh com. It's a good one. I dunno what you're doing.

1575
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:03,240
Speaker 4:  Also, we have gotten a number of submissions to our wearables equation.

1576
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:06,040
Speaker 4:  We're gonna get into that next week. Right? They're very good. We're, we're

1577
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:09,440
Speaker 4:  gonna lay 'em all out. We, we have to do some algebra, so we're gonna figure

1578
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,120
Speaker 4:  out how to do algebra on this podcast.

1579
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:15,320
Speaker 6:  Just imagine that scene from a Beautiful Mind. That's gonna be us next

1580
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:15,560
Speaker 6:  week.

1581
