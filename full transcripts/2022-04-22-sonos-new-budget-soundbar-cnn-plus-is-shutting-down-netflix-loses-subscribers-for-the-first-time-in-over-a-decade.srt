Speaker 1:  90 scale of Dube streaming services, a joke, which I

35
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,870
Speaker 1:  started five years ago, but as newly relevant today,

36
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,770
Speaker 1:  that's the virtuous. I'm your friend Nila. Alex cranes is here.

37

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,550
Speaker 1:  host of the Vergecast new member of the verge staff. David Pierce

42
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,060
Speaker 1:  is here.

43
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,990
Speaker 2:  Hello? I'm your friend who will always share his Netflix password.

44
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,190
Speaker 2:  Always no questions.

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Speaker 1:  I asked, no matter what you can VPN into my house.

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,050
Speaker 2:  And when we break up and you keep ruining my Netflix recommendations, I will

47
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,260
Speaker 2:  not take away your access because I'm just that good. A person.

48
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,710
Speaker 1:  It's funny. Cause I want to take away Max's access. Cause she's really ruining

49
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,550
Speaker 1:  my recommendation. That's huge problem. It's the children. Once they're in

50
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,930
Speaker 1:  there, Netflix has no idea what

51
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,250
Speaker 5:  Cocoa Mellon.

52
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,180
Speaker 1:  Now it's all cocoa Mellon. Liam are pretty

53
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,050
Speaker 1:  strong. The virtuous in creating the producer of decoder, both worked on

54
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,980
Speaker 1:  a kid show called Gabby's dollhouse, which is great. And max likes it and

55
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,830
Speaker 1:  I'm happy to support those two. I just don't need in my

56
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,850
Speaker 1:  recommendations.

57
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,630
Speaker 2:  I've always thought Netflix needed a button. That's just like a regret button

58
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,540
Speaker 2:  where you're like, I should never have watched this. I'm so sorry. Please

59
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,270
Speaker 2:  take this out of my recommendations forever. They were

60
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,820
Speaker 5:  Supposed to give us one. We were supposed to get like a forget button.

61
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,520
Speaker 1:  Okay. I want to talk about that in a minute. First of all, I just want to

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,300
Speaker 1:  point out David was like employee one at the verge in 2010. True. You've

63
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,210
Speaker 1:  been on a journey through the wilderness and now you're back.

64
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,090
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it was just, I was just looking for you, looking for love and looking

65
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,350
Speaker 2:  from your mind. It's all it was

66
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:26,980
Speaker 1:  For here.

67
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,780
Speaker 2:  No, it's, it's both very weird and very good to be back. It kind of feels

68
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,050
Speaker 2:  like no time has passed. It also feels like it has been a literal eternity

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,250
Speaker 2:  since I have done a Vergecast

70
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,270
Speaker 1:  Yeah, you were on stage with us at the 10 year event with Joanna. But I think

71
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,810
Speaker 1:  the last time was like seven years ago. Formally that you did have her chance

72
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,050
Speaker 1:  with us.

73
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,740
Speaker 2:  Yes. Still mercifully. The only time anyone has made me cry on a podcast.

74
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,990
Speaker 2:  So, which is a thing that I would very much like to

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,980
Speaker 1:  Welcome back, David, we've got a new goal for you, buddy. If

76
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,680
Speaker 1:  we don't get to tears the next 90 minutes, I don't know what we're doing

77
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:56,800
Speaker 1:  here.

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,410
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Listen, if CNN plus can't do it to me. Nothing can.

79
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,700
Speaker 1:  So that's so let's talk about the news. David's here. Everybody welcomed

80
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,820
Speaker 1:  him. You can tweet at him. He's at Pierce. It's great. It's great to have

81
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,390
Speaker 1:  you here. We're very excited. We've got big plans to expand the show with

82
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,330
Speaker 1:  David. You're going to see him on the site in a bunch of ways. It's going

83
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,810
Speaker 1:  to be fun. All right. So talk about streaming and really what I want to talk

84
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,810
Speaker 1:  about is not CNN plus or Netflix losing subscribers. I want to talk about

85
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,690
Speaker 1:  this very simple idea that you just brought up, which is you should, every

86
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,410
Speaker 1:  streaming app should have a button that's like play, but

87
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,220
Speaker 1:  don't count it.

88
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,460
Speaker 2:  Yes. I call it the, I feel bad about this button.

89
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,990
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Don't put this in your data.

90
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,920
Speaker 2:  I want it for Spotify. I want it for everything. Like I want to listen to

91
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,790
Speaker 2:  this thing or watch this thing, but please don't tell anyone. I don't

92
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,910
Speaker 2:  remember that. I did it like it it's I would use it all the time. That's

93
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,270
Speaker 2:  all I want.

94
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,800
Speaker 5:  And Cognito mode basically.

95
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,970
Speaker 1:  Yeah. This show ain't a hit that play, but don't pretend that this was, I

96
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,930
Speaker 1:  did this, right. This is how I feel about moon night. I'm watching

97
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,680
Speaker 1:  that shit. But I don't think that this is a good show

98
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,150
Speaker 1:  that anyone should be watching,

99
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,180
Speaker 2:  Right? Yeah. I don't want you to hold this injury in your viewership metrics.

100
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,730
Speaker 2:  I don't want you to use it to decide how much money you're going to pay Oscar,

101
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,880
Speaker 2:  Isaac, like this sucks. And I want you to know it, but I am going to watch

102
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,030
Speaker 2:  it.

103
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,510
Speaker 1:  If ever Disney plus releases metrics on new night, I'm just going to follow

104
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,440
Speaker 1:  they're on me. But minus one, I didn't, I

105
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,070
Speaker 1:  didn't do that willingly. It was just Wednesday and nothing else was happening.

106
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,830
Speaker 1:  I feel very badly about that. We're going to have Charles Pulliam Moore,

107
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,070
Speaker 1:  our new TV critic on the show soon to talk about all the start-up shows.

108
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,350
Speaker 1:  And I really just want to talk to him and brunette the whole time. So don't

109
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,470
Speaker 1:  tell him he thinks he's coming on to soccer about super pumped and we crashed

110
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,310
Speaker 1:  and all that. It's just our me being like, why did they

111
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,090
Speaker 1:  make an ABC TV movie from the nineties on

112
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,840
Speaker 1:  Disney was like, that is the level of quality of the show. I'm sure there

113
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,790
Speaker 1:  are Moonlight fans out there and I encourage you to tweet.

114
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,570
Speaker 2:  I have not watched Moonlight. And now it's a really, it's a hell of a sales

115
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,280
Speaker 2:  pitch. You just did. I cannot wait. I mean,

116
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,250
Speaker 1:  It gets so bad. It has the production quality of remember see quest

117
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,970
Speaker 1:  DSV

118
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,940
Speaker 1:  kids are right in that pocket

119
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,870
Speaker 5:  And also has a talking dolphin. It's wild. How similar they are.

120
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,430
Speaker 1:  It's like what's going on with anyway, the

121
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,910
Speaker 1:  actual streaming services. We're going to talk about what sort of Netflix,

122
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,990
Speaker 1:  because Netflix is a juggernaut. It's I think

123
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,170
Speaker 1:  it's going to be fine, but they just saw subscribers for the first time in

124
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,380
Speaker 1:  over a decade, they announced they're going to do an advertising tier

125
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,490
Speaker 1:  and they are going to crack down on sharing Netflix accounts, the

126
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,760
Speaker 1:  same password across households. That's a lot of change. And I would say

127
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,070
Speaker 1:  people lost their minds.

128
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,000
Speaker 2:  Yes.

129
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,810
Speaker 1:  When all this happened.

130
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,800
Speaker 2:  So I would say my big take on this is that two of those three things

131
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,520
Speaker 2:  you just said are super, super interesting. I think the fact that Netflix

132
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,450
Speaker 2:  lost 200,000 subscribers in a quarter is like a small thing

133
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,050
Speaker 2:  worth noting, but not ultimately like the harbinger of anything.

134
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,920
Speaker 2:  Long-term everything changes. Like there are

135
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,010
Speaker 2:  only so many humans in the world who will ever subscribe to Netflix. Like

136
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,190
Speaker 2:  those numbers are going to go up and down a little more than they have. That

137
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,030
Speaker 2:  does not strike me as all that. Interesting. I think the ad future of Netflix

138
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,240
Speaker 2:  is fascinating. And I think the password thing is going to be super interesting.

139
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,230
Speaker 2:  And it was really incredible to watch the response to this because

140
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,190
Speaker 2:  everybody went from Netflix is the juggernaut. It's the future of TV too.

141
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,820
Speaker 2:  Like in the course of one earnings release, being like, well, Netflix is

142
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,000
Speaker 2:  over.

143
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,050
Speaker 1:  So I have to, I have to do this closures, Vox media as a company, we all

144
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,950
Speaker 1:  work at it. NBC, which owns peacock, which streaming service NBC is a

145
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,760
Speaker 1:  minority investor in Fox media, which we all work at that soundbite,

146
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,540
Speaker 1:  Comcast, Comcast doesn't like, doesn't like us. So there should have closure.

147
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,170
Speaker 1:  The verge is making a Netflix show. It's actually coming out soon. It's gonna

148
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,070
Speaker 1:  be really exciting. I'm the VP of that show. Vox media

149
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,910
Speaker 1:  as a company makes shows for all these streaming services. There's a show

150
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,750
Speaker 1:  on CNN plus, which we're going to talk about. There's a lot. The Vox is show

151
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,000
Speaker 1:  Netflix. Like all the things you can think of, but our show is our show and

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,390
Speaker 1:  we get to say whatever we want. I just make the disclosures. That's the disclosure

153
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,360
Speaker 1:  part. You can't tell me I didn't.

154
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,620
Speaker 5:  You did it. That was great.

155
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,420
Speaker 1:  I wear it like moon night wears the suit

156
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,680
Speaker 1:  All throughout moon night. There's just like wear the suit. And he's like,

157
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,540
Speaker 1:  no, it's like, that's your whole job.

158
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,110
Speaker 5:  That's the one thing we want to see from you. How do we segue that back to

159
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,530
Speaker 5:  Netflix? The one thing we want to see from them is more subscribers.

160
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,800
Speaker 1:  Yes. So you want it. So Netflix loses 200,000 subscribers. There's some

161
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,790
Speaker 1:  underlying data stuff to think about there because they

162
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,840
Speaker 1:  left Russia. So they hadn't left the Russian market and

163
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,780
Speaker 1:  maybe they would have ticked up slightly. But it doesn't matter because net,

164
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,650
Speaker 1:  they lost 200,000 subscribers. They are focused on

165
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,160
Speaker 1:  that subscriber loss, particularly in north America, which is a big, big

166
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,400
Speaker 1:  deal, right? This is the market that's saturated and they are attributing

167
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,180
Speaker 1:  it to look. There's a lot of competition. Now there is Disney plus there

168
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,380
Speaker 1:  is apple TV plus apple TV. Plus just won an Oscar. Their shows are

169
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,950
Speaker 1:  really good. Everyone like severance, there is HBO max, which we should talk

170
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,380
Speaker 1:  about because now it's part of discovery and they're going undergoing changes.

171
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,260
Speaker 1:  But HBO, max has the Batman

172
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,180
Speaker 5:  Scribe,

173
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Speaker 1:  But like that's HBO, max, like they've got the big

174
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,420
Speaker 1:  catalog of HBO stuff.

175
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,690
Speaker 5:  They've got like the whole Turner collection. They've got like all the old

176
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,280
Speaker 5:  movies that nobody else has.

177
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,600
Speaker 1:  You can watch pump up the volume on HBO, max, whenever you want. And

178
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,780
Speaker 1:  then, you know, the Batman was a sensation in theaters and it quickly hit

179
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,930
Speaker 1:  the streaming service and then everyone watched it again and it had another

180
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,980
Speaker 1:  cycle, like that's real competition regardless of the corporate

181
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,550
Speaker 1:  chaos of 18 T and Warner media and discovery

182
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,350
Speaker 1:  like they're executing.

183
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,260
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well, and it's an interesting thing because I was thinking about this

184
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,220
Speaker 2:  in the course of prepping for this, that like, I almost couldn't describe

185
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,120
Speaker 2:  to you what Netflix is the streaming service for anymore. Cause

186
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,720
Speaker 2:  it's like HBO is starting to lock down the sort of really like

187
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,650
Speaker 2:  blockbustery prestige stuff more and more Disney is the

188
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,710
Speaker 2:  place you go that has all of the stuff that like your kids want to watch.

189
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,710
Speaker 2:  And it's like the family friendly one that has all the Marvel and star wars

190
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,610
Speaker 2:  like that pitch is easy. A peacock is where do you go to watch

191
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,640
Speaker 2:  the office paramount plus exists?

192
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,620
Speaker 1:  No apparent my is going to have top gun Mavericks.

193
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,040
Speaker 2:  Okay. There you go. So there's a tail switch and I'm kind of at a point where

194
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,100
Speaker 2:  like Netflix, his big thing is just that it's Netflix, right? Like it is,

195
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,220
Speaker 2:  it is just the one everybody already has and that's

196
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,610
Speaker 2:  super powerful, but it does seem like we're getting to a point now where

197
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,240
Speaker 2:  like, if I have subscription fatigue, like how long is the list of things

198
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,690
Speaker 2:  that are like dragging people back to Netflix every single day anymore. And

199
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,070
Speaker 2:  it feels like that list is getting shorter.

200
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,820
Speaker 5:  This is what Netflix has been scared of for years though. Right? Like they

201
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,420
Speaker 5:  started losing their catalog. They started losing friends in the office and

202
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,410
Speaker 5:  star Trek and everything else. And those went to smaller, serve smaller services.

203
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,650
Speaker 5:  And so they've been terrified of this. That's why they've been investing.

204
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,890
Speaker 5:  They've been trying to build this catalog. And I honestly think that this

205
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,770
Speaker 5:  is all because they screwed up because they're like, we know, we know we

206
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,680
Speaker 5:  got to build a catalog. We got to do like apple TV. We've got to make like

207
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,800
Speaker 5:  a reason for people to come here. But instead of everybody else who goes

208
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,710
Speaker 5:  and like figures out what shows people want to watch and make them

209
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,810
Speaker 5:  Netflix was like, we're going to use an algorithm to figure out how

210
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,230
Speaker 5:  to like, min-max this shit. And that's how we're going to make

211
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,160
Speaker 5:  content. And now everybody's like, but it's all boring and

212
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,930
Speaker 5:  bad and blahzay

213
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,950
Speaker 2:  Because the algorithm told them the thing to do is go all in on like niche,

214
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,400
Speaker 2:  weird dating shows. Yeah. Which I've watched all of them,

215
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,360
Speaker 5:  The international selections. Incredible. But it's mainly through like partnerships

216
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,960
Speaker 5:  with other, other channels. And then there's like, all the American stuff

217
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,200
Speaker 5:  is like stuff that canceled after two seasons.

218
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,310
Speaker 1:  When I say people went crazy because Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers,

219
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,790
Speaker 1:  like literally got all the way to, this is the end of prestige TV.

220
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,530
Speaker 1:  Right. Like, and it was like, what are you talking about? Right. Like they

221
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,830
Speaker 1:  were sort of not making it when they were making it. It was like house of

222
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,670
Speaker 1:  cards. And it was like one specific era. But what isn't Netflix like

223
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,150
Speaker 1:  very famous for. It's like two seasons or a thing that a

224
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,940
Speaker 1:  small, very dedicated crew fans likes and then cutting

225
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,870
Speaker 1:  it and then moving on. Right. And like we've heard from TV

226
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,540
Speaker 1:  executives over the years or like Netflix isn't promote our work the way

227
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,200
Speaker 1:  the other streamers do that is in contrast to

228
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,170
Speaker 1:  a lot of TV. People saying Netflix is the best to work for it. Cause they'll

229
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,800
Speaker 1:  cut you a check in and get out of your way. Which I always think of that

230
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,700
Speaker 1:  is like a blessing and a curse. Like it's a lot of smart, creative people

231
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,540
Speaker 1:  without an editor. And then as an editor, you know, I have a very specific

232
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,810
Speaker 1:  feeling about that, which is like, everybody needs an editor. It's like,

233
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,300
Speaker 1:  there's a lot of just like bloat in the middle of Netflix shows

234
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,200
Speaker 2:  One. It sounds like even now Netflix is aware of that. Like

235
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,650
Speaker 2:  I think it was Matthew Ball was tweeting about this earlier after the, the

236
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,610
Speaker 2:  news came out, that Netflix is aware of the thing that

237
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,570
Speaker 2:  you're describing and is kind of 18 months into a plan

238
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,750
Speaker 2:  to fix some of that where they're like, and they've been saying, we need

239
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,900
Speaker 2:  to reinvest in, in quality over quantity, which is like a very funny thing

240
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,510
Speaker 2:  for somebody like Netflix to say, it's like, well, yeah, we all could have

241
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,630
Speaker 2:  told you that that was going to be the case, but they just made it so much

242
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,260
Speaker 2:  stuff for so long that I think they were

243
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,710
Speaker 2:  maybe later than they needed to be to realizing like, oh, what we actually

244
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,610
Speaker 2:  need is a handful of really good, really sticky, really

245
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,390
Speaker 2:  long lasting things. And the problem is they're halfway into the

246
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,140
Speaker 2:  process of making some of that stuff and making that stuff is really, really,

247
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,530
Speaker 2:  really hard. Like they made squid games. Everybody's like, cool. But like

248
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,710
Speaker 2:  there's not 80 more seasons of squid game that people are gonna watch.

249
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,570
Speaker 1:  Oh, they're going to now they're gonna find a way

250
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,560
Speaker 5:  Pushback on that idea that they're, they're redoing things. Cause they aren't

251
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,280
Speaker 5:  like they just, this week got rid of their head of animation. That was one

252
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,730
Speaker 5:  of the places where they were really standing out and they were really competing

253
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,480
Speaker 5:  and, and starting to like take all these really cool creators from Disney

254
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,600
Speaker 5:  and cartoon network and, and building up this thing under this guy, Phil

255
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,470
Speaker 5:  Renda, who had started at cartoon network, he found like adventure

256
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,190
Speaker 5:  time, which kicked off this huge animation Renaissance. And like

257
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,970
Speaker 5:  they were building a new animation Renaissance at Netflix. And then they're

258
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,730
Speaker 5:  like, no, we're going to fire that guy and like cancel everything. Oh, you

259
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,700
Speaker 5:  wanted bone. We've been trying to make it for 25 years. Nevermind. You're

260
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,660
Speaker 5:  not getting it. And he was one of those rare people that was actually thinking

261
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,420
Speaker 5:  about, okay, what is good content? How do we make good content? I will not

262
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,260
Speaker 5:  just listen to the algorithm and they get rid of him. And like, that seems

263
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,610
Speaker 5:  very, very stupid.

264
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,020
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But I, I don't ever really know how to evaluate those things.

265
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,260
Speaker 1:  Right. Like how big was the audience for that? Netflix won't give us the

266
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,770
Speaker 1:  numbers. Maybe they're spending a lot of money in animation. No one was watching

267
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,610
Speaker 1:  it. Or they were spending a lot of money on animation and a very small

268
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,880
Speaker 1:  number of very loyal people were watching it and tweeting a lot. And that

269
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,480
Speaker 1:  just like skews our perception of everything. One of the core problems with

270
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,440
Speaker 1:  all of these services is that they're utterly opaque in a way

271
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,890
Speaker 1:  that I don't know, broadcast TV and cable TV all had Nielsen.

272
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,060
Speaker 1:  So we could, we had some way of measuring something.

273
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,530
Speaker 1:  Even if Nielsen wasn't perfect.

274
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,350
Speaker 5:  That's going to change soon. Right? Because like all of these, all of these

275
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,340
Speaker 5:  people are also pivoting to advertising and you can't do advertising

276
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,250
Speaker 5:  without metrics. Like nobody's, I mean, I hope they do try. I

277
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,000
Speaker 5:  hope they go the tumbler route and like just have the worst ads on all the

278
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,900
Speaker 5:  Netflix shows like that would bring me personally joy. But at some point

279
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,630
Speaker 5:  we're going to have to get metrics because like, who's going to want to,

280
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,300
Speaker 5:  like, they're going to say, oh yeah, everybody watches, squid gains. Did

281
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,180
Speaker 5:  everybody watch squid games? Are you just telling us that? Cause you can

282
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,550
Speaker 5:  do that, but you can't do that to the advertisers.

283
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,120
Speaker 1:  Well, so now Netflix has started releasing some numbers. They've got a website

284
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,020
Speaker 1:  now, you know, the it's like total engagement or

285
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,260
Speaker 1:  something like some number that no one else uses. So you can't measure it.

286
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,010
Speaker 1:  Exactly. But the thing you're saying about advertising and the password

287
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,460
Speaker 1:  sharing thing is really interesting because it connects directly to it. David

288
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,490
Speaker 1:  was saying about, you kind of run out of people in United States. Yeah. You

289
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,390
Speaker 1:  sort of have any sort of haven't right. They've got 200 million people

290
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,340
Speaker 1:  around the world more or less.

291
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,360
Speaker 2:  It's like two 20. Yeah,

292
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,650
Speaker 1:  Yeah. 220 something accounts, 220 million. So many accounts around the world.

293
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,160
Speaker 1:  There's more people than that in United States. So you haven't like maxed

294
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,730
Speaker 1:  it out yet. There's a billions of people in the world. And like, you know,

295
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,030
Speaker 1:  the hyperbolic headline of maybe this is as big as any streaming service

296
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,390
Speaker 1:  and get like, or you can do a lot of things. So one thing we can do

297
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,680
Speaker 1:  is eliminate password sharing. And the way that they have hinted

298
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,250
Speaker 1:  at doing is they won't just cut you off. They'll tell the

299
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,210
Speaker 1:  person whose password you're sharing. Hey, you could just

300
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,170
Speaker 1:  pay some more money to support your friends or your ex

301
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,460
Speaker 1:  or whoever it is.

302
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,630
Speaker 5:  I'm going to do that.

303
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,530
Speaker 1:  Right. So like, I'm going to get the note about my parents And

304
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,280
Speaker 1:  I'm like, yeah, just pay the money for mom and dad. So like they will

305
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,400
Speaker 1:  attract some revenue in that way. Then if you're like, I'm not going to pay

306
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,240
Speaker 1:  for my ex, I'm going to cut them off. You'll what they'll drop down to

307
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,720
Speaker 1:  is a lower ad supported tier. So then Netflix will

308
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,380
Speaker 1:  retain you on a cheaper tier or maybe even a

309
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,280
Speaker 1:  free ad supported tier and say, you still have Netflix. We

310
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,370
Speaker 1:  didn't take it away from you. Right. We just put some ads in it.

311
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,510
Speaker 5:  Is it going to be like punishment? Like if you don't pay, you have to move

312
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,050
Speaker 5:  to ads.

313
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,600
Speaker 1:  Well, no. Cause like maybe you're like, I just don't want Netflix, but what

314
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,910
Speaker 1:  they're not going to do is like penalize everyone. They're going to like

315
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,810
Speaker 1:  have these off-ramps into either more money or ads. And

316
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,410
Speaker 1:  that like increases your number of users, which is like very,

317
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,730
Speaker 1:  very clever way of doing

318
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,930
Speaker 2:  It is I am fascinated by what the like copywriting

319
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,590
Speaker 2:  meetings are going to be like for how they tell your parents and my

320
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,010
Speaker 2:  exes, what just happened. It's like

321
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,030
Speaker 2:  Nila decided he doesn't want to pay for you anymore. He

322
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,990
Speaker 2:  doesn't love you enough to pay for your Netflix profile. So here's some ads

323
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,650
Speaker 2:  thanked me like,

324
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,640
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean, and they've got to find ways to solve it. People will travel.

325
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,130
Speaker 1:  So like, if you're traveling out of your house, like they'll, they'll do

326
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,970
Speaker 1:  this stuff that quite frankly, all the live TV services have done, like

327
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,570
Speaker 1:  YouTube TV has figured this out. Hulu has pretended to figure it out. But

328
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,230
Speaker 1:  Hulu is just like, are you somewhere else? Go to jail wherever you are. If

329
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,500
Speaker 1:  you're not in your home, this is probably jail of some kind that you should

330
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,310
Speaker 1:  be in. So all these services have these like geolocation restrictions, but

331
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,250
Speaker 1:  the idea that they will initiate new people and advertising, they've got

332
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,210
Speaker 1:  a ramp with password sharing into, here's a soft landing on

333
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,180
Speaker 1:  the ad supported here that you're not paying for. And if you want to pay,

334
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,720
Speaker 1:  you can still pay for the new thing. They've got to execute all of

335
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,380
Speaker 1:  that. But that's actually how you end up growing your business. You add

336
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,190
Speaker 1:  pricing tiers, right? You make a cheaper one and a more expensive one. Like

337
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,400
Speaker 1:  every, you know, there's an, there's an iPhone at every $50 price point that

338
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,090
Speaker 1:  you can think of. Cause it's like, do you have some money? You should spend

339
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,960
Speaker 1:  it. And right now Netflix is like, to your point, David, like, they've

340
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,740
Speaker 1:  just acted like the default. Yeah. Your first $15 in your streaming budget

341
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,420
Speaker 1:  goes to Netflix. And I think that might be,

342
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,690
Speaker 2:  I kind of think so. I, I, if I had to pick one as the default right now,

343
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,150
Speaker 2:  I think it's probably a Disney plus. Like if, if you're only going to get

344
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,750
Speaker 2:  one streaming service, it feels increasingly to me, like the answer is Disney.

345
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,170
Speaker 2:  Plus

346
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,000
Speaker 5:  You have small children in your

347
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,270
Speaker 2:  Home. I don't, but I know a lot of people who do so it's possible that I'm

348
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:43,050
Speaker 2:  very biased. I also think that's what HBO max is after and has a real shot

349
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,940
Speaker 2:  at pulling off with the whole discovery thing.

350
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,270
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I was going to say like HBO, max would be where my, like

351
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,650
Speaker 1:  That's where my first money would go.

352
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,760
Speaker 5:  And like if it fixed its app for God, I refuse to have it be my

353
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,260
Speaker 5:  only one with its terrible app.

354
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,260
Speaker 1:  I think there was a secret update to the HBO max app. There

355
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,350
Speaker 5:  Was it now does a BombBomb like, like Netflix.

356
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,800
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It has the weird circle spinner. And I think the purple got darker

357
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,000
Speaker 1:  And they didn't say anything about it. So I'm just, I'm just there being

358
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,930
Speaker 1:  like, is that purple? Darker? Should I read into this? And then the app

359
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,620
Speaker 1:  is like ever so slightly slower and I'm like, maybe it's not an update, but

360
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,630
Speaker 1:  then it's like, boom, it's like, it's different.

361
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,510
Speaker 5:  And these are just like, don't actually test things before they push them

362
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,440
Speaker 5:  live. I think we are the test subjects. They just push it live and I'm like,

363
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,540
Speaker 5:  did anybody complain? No, no. Keep going, keep going, keep

364
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,490
Speaker 1:  Going. They should just let me in there. Let me design here.

365
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,290
Speaker 5:  But do you really think that like Netflix is actually going to add subscribers

366
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,010
Speaker 5:  because they think of this bonkers number of like a hundred million

367
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,320
Speaker 5:  people or a hundred million subscriptions are being lost to,

368
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,180
Speaker 5:  to password sharing. Do you really think they're going to claim all of those

369
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,050
Speaker 5:  back or is the company

370
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,800
Speaker 1:  That's the same number as like the recording industry being like, we would

371
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,310
Speaker 1:  have made 50 million more dollars last year, if not for piracy. And it's

372
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,150
Speaker 1:  like, no, I definitely wouldn't have listened to anything. Sorry.

373
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,650
Speaker 1:  Like I definitely like ripped all of my friend's CDs and I wasn't like

374
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,300
Speaker 1:  <inaudible>,

375
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,480
Speaker 5:  I think we're also reaching this point where I'm seeing more and more people

376
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,720
Speaker 5:  say, how do you use bit torrent? Like I'm seeing like this increase in like

377
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,650
Speaker 5:  interest in piracy. I'm seeing this increase in like interest in not

378
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,430
Speaker 5:  paying for the shit

379
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,310
Speaker 1:  Spoken like a true Nvidia shield on her. I

380
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,480
Speaker 5:  Right. I love my Plex. Very legally acquired

381
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,350
Speaker 5:  materials on it. But like, I just really don't think

382
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,800
Speaker 5:  that they're these, all these people, these hundred million households or

383
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,410
Speaker 5:  whatever are going to be like, okay, well there's a cheaper version now I'm

384
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,070
Speaker 5:  going to go get it.

385
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,680
Speaker 1:  But I think you can point to that and saying, we'll get some percentage of

386
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,100
Speaker 1:  them. Yeah.

387
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,260
Speaker 5:  I guess they will. They'll get their 200,000 back.

388
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,980
Speaker 1:  Yes. I mean, that's a very small percentage, a hundred million people.

389
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,670
Speaker 2:  I think. I mean, to me, the, the ad thing is much more

390
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,400
Speaker 2:  about like other countries outside the S than it is the U S and like

391
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,880
Speaker 2:  there's some like me layer, right? Not everyone in America has Netflix already,

392
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,270
Speaker 2:  so there's some gain to be had there. But I think like the, the thing that

393
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,240
Speaker 2:  I've heard over and over about India for instance, is that like Netflix is

394
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,780
Speaker 2:  just too expensive in India. And people have cable subscriptions that are

395
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,770
Speaker 2:  not very expensive, that they're not eager to cancel. And so Netflix just

396
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,250
Speaker 2:  has not been able to make the same pitch in countries like that, that it

397
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,640
Speaker 2:  has here, which is like, we have tons of stuff to watch and we're cheaper

398
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,580
Speaker 2:  than cable. Like that is actually not how it works in India, but something

399
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,810
Speaker 2:  like additive, which is like a cheaper free Netflix

400
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,710
Speaker 2:  or not free, but a cheaper ad supported Netflix is going to be

401
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,520
Speaker 2:  much more compelling to people in countries like that. Where $20 a month

402
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,510
Speaker 2:  for Netflix seems ludicrous. But half that plus ads

403
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,990
Speaker 2:  or a quarter of that plus ads might be a lot more compelling. So that's

404
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,140
Speaker 2:  like, I think the, the sort of fail gracefully into ads thing is really interesting,

405
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,860
Speaker 2:  but my sense is the people who would pay for Netflix

406
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,400
Speaker 2:  at what it costs now and the people who want it with ads are like more

407
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,850
Speaker 2:  separate groups of people than, than maybe I had been thinking. Yeah,

408
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,360
Speaker 1:  Yeah. We actually have a pitch in, from an Indian reporter about why Netflix

409
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,550
Speaker 1:  failed in any of that. I'm very excited to read when it comes in.

410
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,000
Speaker 2:  That's exciting. I look forward to my theory being totally wrong when that

411
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,680
Speaker 2:  sort of anxious. So that'd be great.

412
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,940
Speaker 1:  I think that market is particularly interesting for a wide variety of reasons

413
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,050
Speaker 1:  at the end of the day, though, what I think the real cause of this like day

414
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,890
Speaker 1:  long freak out about Netflix is because this market is now competitive

415
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,090
Speaker 1:  and everyone has forgotten what super competitive tech markets look like.

416
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,140
Speaker 1:  Like you have a lot of choices and you can bail and spend your money somewhere

417
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,070
Speaker 1:  else. And a lot of people looked at Netflix this past quarter and

418
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,940
Speaker 1:  bailed and like most of these companies do not have that experience,

419
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,520
Speaker 1:  right. Like, no, one's like, you know what, I'm going to do an Android phone

420
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,400
Speaker 1:  today. I think on the show, sometimes we pretend that

421
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,170
Speaker 1:  right. But like every, I mean we do earnings every quarter and every quarter

422
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,830
Speaker 1:  it's like apple had another record quarter or like Amazon is like once

423
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,760
Speaker 1:  again, an Amazon number of Kindles were so, and they're like, what does that

424
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,390
Speaker 1:  mean? And they're like the most Kendall's compared to the number of

425
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,540
Speaker 1:  Kindles previously sold compared to the number of Kindles that I imagined.

426
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Speaker 1:  And it's like, that's so not a number, but it sounds great. And the other

427
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,200
Speaker 1:  numbers going up and like, we just haven't seen any of the big tech

428
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,070
Speaker 1:  companies take a hit in such a long time that when they do it

429
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,820
Speaker 1:  feels like something is over as opposed to just how markets work,

430
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,770
Speaker 1:  like people left and came back.

431
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,160
Speaker 2:  I think that's right. Well, and I also think it's clearly the end of one

432
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,730
Speaker 2:  phase of this industry for companies like Netflix too, which is basically

433
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,650
Speaker 2:  just the throw money at the problem phase. Right. And yeah, even going back,

434
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:23,560
Speaker 2:  Netflix basically was able to throw money at the problem and keep

435
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,890
Speaker 2:  growing like crazy forever. And if there's one thing we know investors in

436
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,310
Speaker 2:  particular, like it's a hilarious amounts of money being spent in service

437
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,940
Speaker 2:  of hilarious amounts of growth. And now Netflix is saying, we need to

438
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,840
Speaker 2:  spend less on dumb stuff and be a little more prudent about how we

439
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,680
Speaker 2:  spend our money. And investors are saying, well, that freaks

440
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,470
Speaker 2:  us out because, because like the, the freewheeling era of streaming

441
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,190
Speaker 2:  growing is just, is just not going to keep being this

442
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,220
Speaker 2:  freewheeling. Like, as they got bigger, as they start to make a real dent

443
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,360
Speaker 2:  in the cable industry, it was always going to happen like this. And I think

444
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,540
Speaker 2:  Netflix just, unfortunately for Netflix gets to be kind of the first through

445
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,970
Speaker 2:  the gate of like, this is a real industry now.

446
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,930
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean, the phone companies is uncompetitive as that market

447
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,530
Speaker 1:  is right at and T and Verizon and T-Mobile track their

448
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,250
Speaker 1:  churn amongst each other and they carefully manage their prices. So that

449
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,140
Speaker 1:  they're all the same all the time. Anyway,

450
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,990
Speaker 5:  Now we're going to have a quad opoly. What's the streaming one. How

451
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,680
Speaker 5:  many are there

452
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,730
Speaker 1:  Streaming is just like this like super competitive market. Like, I don't

453
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,540
Speaker 1:  think it is a four-sided race between Netflix and

454
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,170
Speaker 1:  HBO, max and Disney plus and peacock. Like there's a lot of

455
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,350
Speaker 1:  entrance and there's a lot of ways to spend your money.

456
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,220
Speaker 1:  And like, some of them are just gonna fail and some of them are going to

457
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,980
Speaker 1:  succeed and some of them are just trade subscribers. Like, like, I think

458
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,970
Speaker 1:  it's actually relatively cool that unlike a cable or

459
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,420
Speaker 1:  your phone service, like you can just quit these apps like month to month.

460
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,410
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Is there anything else out there like that? Like I, I subscribed to

461
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,250
Speaker 2:  Showtime for a month so that I could watch super pumped and yellow jackets

462
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,220
Speaker 2:  and I have two more episodes of yellow jackets. And when I'm done with them,

463
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,670
Speaker 2:  I'm going to cancel them until another season of those shows comes out. And

464
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,240
Speaker 2:  it's such an unusual mechanic that like,

465
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,020
Speaker 2:  I can just, anyone who's paying attention can just do that with

466
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,870
Speaker 2:  five different services, five times a year. And you end up saving yourself

467
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,020
Speaker 2:  a bunch of money and it's going to make their numbers chaos all the time.

468
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,420
Speaker 2:  It's so unlike anything else I can think of

469
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,470
Speaker 5:  Man, if only they had some sort of like hard copy

470
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,100
Speaker 5:  version of these things that you could just buy for a lot more money

471
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,320
Speaker 5:  and oh, that would be wild.

472
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,660
Speaker 1:  That'd be great. I

473
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,550
Speaker 2:  Don't even know what you're talking about. That seems crazy.

474
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,430
Speaker 1:  And then you would have them and you wouldn't be like renting them anyway.

475
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,150
Speaker 1:  So that's Netflix. I suspect Netflix will be fine.

476
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,310
Speaker 2:  Stranger things is coming. So Netflix is going to be fine.

477
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,830
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Stranger things is coming. All those people will come back.

478
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,750
Speaker 5:  Sweet games got renewed.

479
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,130
Speaker 2:  Everybody dies again.

480
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,270
Speaker 5:  They're just going to resurrect everybody who knows.

481
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,930
Speaker 1:  Oh, it's just seemed like they need hits. Right. TV is a hits business. Netflix

482
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,770
Speaker 1:  needs more hits apple TV. Severance is a hit. Right. But we have no

483
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,210
Speaker 1:  idea if it's actually a hit,

484
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,970
Speaker 5:  It's a hit in the verge newsroom. That's it?

485
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,570
Speaker 2:  It's it's. I mean, it's the best. It should be a hit everywhere. If it's

486
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,780
Speaker 2:  not, I will, I will go to the grave telling people to watch severance, but

487
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,470
Speaker 2:  it does make me think, like, I wonder if the other half of the

488
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:19,250
Speaker 2:  strategy, which is basically like you need hits, but you also need sort of

489
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,030
Speaker 2:  the background, like turn off your brain television. And people have been

490
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,150
Speaker 2:  talking about that forever as like the thing Netflix didn't have. And Netflix

491
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,550
Speaker 2:  has invested really hard in that they have tons of house shows. They have

492
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:32,150
Speaker 2:  tons of food shows they have is this cake. They have all these different

493
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,630
Speaker 2:  kinds of like deliberately non prestige TV.

494
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,980
Speaker 2:  And I'm starting to wonder if that is actually the hook

495
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,620
Speaker 2:  to keep people that maybe a lot of people thought it was. And if we're going

496
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,630
Speaker 2:  to maybe get a swing away from that now,

497
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,480
Speaker 5:  Was it Netflix? They created the random button.

498
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,250
Speaker 1:  Yes they have. They have the shuffle,

499
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Speaker 5:  The shuffle, like, yeah. They just invented TV channels.

500
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,190
Speaker 1:  The shuffle is great, but you need the, I watch this, but don't count it

501
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,860
Speaker 1:  button. Like that's actually way more important than the shuffle button.

502
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,650
Speaker 1:  The I'm so sorry. So we should, we should pivot to discovery because that

503
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,640
Speaker 1:  idea that you'll have all the background noise, big part of the discovery

504
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,480
Speaker 1:  strategy. Yep. They make a lot of that stuff. They have it

505
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,350
Speaker 1:  all. It's on discovery plus. And they just bought Warner

506
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,320
Speaker 1:  media Warner media on CNN,

507
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,730
Speaker 1:  CNN plus launched less than a month ago, under 80 and T

508
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,410
Speaker 1:  the story. So it goes is a discovery did not

509
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,400
Speaker 1:  want CNN plus to launch, but they were legally prohibited

510
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,720
Speaker 1:  from telling anyone at 18 T had a manage the business before the

511
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:33,990
Speaker 1:  deal.

512
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,350
Speaker 2:  So instead they had to talk very publicly about their pants.

513
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,310
Speaker 2:  It actually makes a lot of sense in retrospect, right? Cause they gave an

514
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,670
Speaker 2:  unusual number of interviews in the run-up to all of this happening. Being

515
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,430
Speaker 2:  like here is what we think the future should look like

516
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,070
Speaker 2:  just to no one in particular, just like standing outside the office and

517
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,870
Speaker 2:  screaming. Like here's what I think.

518
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,650
Speaker 1:  So the deal closes it's less than a month I'd ever seen him plus, and they

519
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,340
Speaker 1:  shut it down today. They said, it's going to be over on April 3rd. The thing

520
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,860
Speaker 1:  lasted 29, 23

521
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,340
Speaker 5:  Days,

522
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,730
Speaker 1:  23 days is today. But it's, you know, it's got like seven more.

523
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,180
Speaker 2:  It'll be like 31 by the time it dies.

524
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,870
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So a full month virtual virtuous listeners may know I'll reintroduce

525
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,500
Speaker 1:  everyone to this concept. Verizon was the first to doom

526
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,830
Speaker 1:  streaming services. They want you to think called go 90. It was so named

527
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,130
Speaker 1:  because when you watch a video on your phone, you're supposed to turn your

528
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,060
Speaker 1:  phone to landscape. Verizon. The phone company did not

529
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,630
Speaker 1:  think about portrait video when they watched their streaming service.

530
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,680
Speaker 1:  So they're like, everyone's gonna turn their phones, go 90, say launched

531
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,370
Speaker 1:  this weird mishmash of a YouTube competitor. And they bought a bunch of cheap

532
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,850
Speaker 1:  crap. If they called it go 90, they spent 80 billion or $80 million in this.

533
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,710
Speaker 1:  They said it was a bet, the company moment. And it just collapsed into

534
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,410
Speaker 1:  dust. We did an amazing story in video on it. Ben

535
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,010
Speaker 1:  popper, when he still worked here, that's how that was for us. And it's ready

536
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,270
Speaker 1:  to show you. It's sexy side

537
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,700
Speaker 1:  all time headline. It was nuts. The whole thing was nuts.

538
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,660
Speaker 1:  This thus was born to the go 90 scale of doom streaming services,

539
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,770
Speaker 1:  which goes from zero to 90. 90 is death when you've gone

540
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,280
Speaker 1:  90.

541
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,970
Speaker 2:  So Netflix is like a two. We would say

542
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,890
Speaker 1:  Netflix was for a long time, lived at one.

543
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,400
Speaker 2:  Okay,

544
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,150
Speaker 1:  Great. Every streaming service is doomed. That's like,

545
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,110
Speaker 1:  this is the underlying conceit of the whole thing. It's just like how close

546
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,560
Speaker 1:  to 90 are you? So Netflix for years it was like, was it one

547
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,850
Speaker 1:  YouTube? Is it one right? You're you're still doomed. Well, we're just

548
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,870
Speaker 1:  not anywhere close to yet. Right? Like nothing gets to zero. Cause

549
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,450
Speaker 1:  everyone, you know, time is relentless.

550
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,170
Speaker 1:  Death comes for us. All right. So Netflix and YouTube were always kind of

551
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,050
Speaker 1:  at one Quimbee started life at

552
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:47,470
Speaker 2:  80

553
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,150
Speaker 5:  And just quickly,

554
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,130
Speaker 1:  Quickly progressed itself

555
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,200
Speaker 2:  Tonight. I think 80 was generous as it turned

556
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,220
Speaker 5:  Out, very generous.

557
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,050
Speaker 1:  We, you know, we had a meeting with cats. He was very

558
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,860
Speaker 1:  convincing. So I, so CNN plus fastest

559
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,720
Speaker 1:  time to 90, it

560
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,470
Speaker 5:  Did a speed run

561
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,940
Speaker 2:  By a wide margin

562
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,500
Speaker 1:  Launched at 85 left us 23 days later at night,

563
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,640
Speaker 5:  It could be lasted like eight months and see it in plus couldn't last a

564
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:15,970
Speaker 5:  month.

565
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,570
Speaker 1:  So I encourage, if you have thoughts about where other streaming services

566
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,090
Speaker 1:  are on the go 90 scale of doom streaming services, you can tweet them at

567
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,300
Speaker 1:  me. I'm reckless. You can tweet them at David. He's a Pierce. Alex is illustrates

568
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,960
Speaker 1:  Krantz. Just let us know. Cause once you start thinking of these companies

569
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,850
Speaker 1:  in this way, you quickly realize like, oh, they're all on it.

570
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,630
Speaker 2:  We need a thing on the verge.com where you can make your own slider. Will

571
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,040
Speaker 2:  it give you a bunch of, you can put them on there.

572
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,490
Speaker 1:  So Paul Miller made one for us. It's still up. It's gone.

573
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,390
Speaker 1:  ninety.biz.

574
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,080
Speaker 2:  That's amazing.

575
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,700
Speaker 1:  It's not great. It's really not great. He refused to

576
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,480
Speaker 1:  label the chart, which isn't a real virtue. It's

577
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,540
Speaker 1:  still, it's still works. You can look at it. You can be like, oh, voodoo

578
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,500
Speaker 1:  that's oh, we're at 90. It's fun to do. We're

579
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,040
Speaker 1:  going to make another one. But right now, so I would put the things that

580
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,940
Speaker 1:  are closest to life. One, I would put ATRIO max at like a one, like

581
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,450
Speaker 1:  it's gonna survive. Netflix is like maybe at a

582
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,260
Speaker 1:  five now. Right? Like it had a bad quarter. They need to rejigger.

583
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,800
Speaker 1:  It's the first time they've moved off of that spot. Disney plus is looking

584
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,560
Speaker 1:  like a, you know, they've got actually challenges. They've got investors

585
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,460
Speaker 1:  worried about the reorg. We just had Julia Alexander on decoder.

586
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,480
Speaker 1:  Like they've had to pull off a lot of things. That's not a one that's also

587
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,020
Speaker 1:  looking like a five. So like, I just think this market is so hard and so

588
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,980
Speaker 1:  competitive. And they were all betting on endless growth and people signing

589
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,820
Speaker 1:  up for streaming. And what they're kind of getting is like, people have a

590
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,730
Speaker 1:  finite amount of money for entertainment and they're not just going to leave

591
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,700
Speaker 1:  these subscriptions on forever. They're just going to quit on you unless

592
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,240
Speaker 1:  you have something great to show them. And what you have is moon night. Well,

593
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,640
Speaker 1:  you better hope you have blue in the background because

594
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,570
Speaker 2:  That's well, and part of it is also, I think that the last two years

595
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,410
Speaker 2:  in retrospect kind of screwed them all because they all grew so fast.

596
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,860
Speaker 2:  And everybody's memory is so short that it was like, oh,

597
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,880
Speaker 2:  explosive growth for two years because no one went outside. That's the

598
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,840
Speaker 2:  future forever. And ever. And then you get a little bit of retrenchment

599
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,560
Speaker 2:  back to like where these companies would have

600
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:18,340
Speaker 2:  gone. If they had gone on a normal trajectory for the last couple of years

601
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:22,300
Speaker 2:  and people start to panic. So it's like the, the, the whip sighing of it,

602
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,440
Speaker 5:  200,000 people were the ones with lives. They've overturned.

603
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,210
Speaker 2:  They've have all gone outside now.

604
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,140
Speaker 1:  And the people who went to HBO, max, cause they wanted to watch a

605
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,560
Speaker 1:  square version of justice league black and white for

606
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,430
Speaker 2:  Nine hours.

607
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:40,460
Speaker 1:  The greatest money ATG has ever spent straight up the fact that at

608
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,420
Speaker 1:  and T paid for Zack Snyder to make a 43 black and

609
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,350
Speaker 1:  white version of justice league will go down in history as the best money

610
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,070
Speaker 1:  any phone company has ever spent. Like it's like

611
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,810
Speaker 1:  unbelievable that that happened. So CNN plus

612
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,290
Speaker 1:  discovery shuts it down. They have this meeting, the new guy who runs

613
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,190
Speaker 1:  CNN plus Chris Licht. He's a discovery guy because Jeff Zucker was pushed

614
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,090
Speaker 1:  out by Warner media. He said they had built a beautiful house, but

615
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,780
Speaker 1:  then this is a quote. Then the new owner came in and said, what a beautiful

616
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,410
Speaker 1:  house, but I need an apartment that doesn't take anything away from this

617
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,380
Speaker 1:  beautiful house you built. I am proud of you. And I am proud of this team,

618
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,490
Speaker 1:  but I am gutted by what this means for you. And what he means is burning

619
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,270
Speaker 1:  down your house.

620
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,040
Speaker 2:  You built such a good house.

621
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,930
Speaker 1:  I have no choice, but to torch it in discovery's whole

622
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,590
Speaker 1:  strategy is like basically bundling CNN plus into HBO,

623
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,490
Speaker 1:  max bundling, ATRIO max with discovery plus and

624
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,520
Speaker 1:  creating kind of David where you're talking about. She's like a super app

625
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,480
Speaker 1:  of content that is always on that has the first run movies that

626
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,290
Speaker 1:  has the kind of like background home shows

627
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,390
Speaker 1:  that has potentially live news. That's a cable bundle in

628
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,510
Speaker 1:  there. They want to make that.

629
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,530
Speaker 2:  And this is the thing that the discovery executives have been unusually forthcoming

630
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,350
Speaker 2:  about over the last few months. Like typically in a case like this, where

631
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,470
Speaker 2:  you have a big merger coming and it's, it's one of, it's two of the biggest

632
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,860
Speaker 2:  players in streaming. Everybody's kind of coy about what they're up to, right?

633
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,770
Speaker 2:  Like they don't usually have a lot of incentive to like roll out their grand

634
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,550
Speaker 2:  plan. But over and over discovered executives just kept getting up there

635
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,390
Speaker 2:  being like, we think bundling is the answer. We are going to

636
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:21,080
Speaker 2:  have one app and like mincing, no

637
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,630
Speaker 2:  words about it. They were like, yeah, we think the best future for discovery

638
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:27,260
Speaker 2:  plus and HBO max is if they are one thing and given the way this company

639
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,240
Speaker 2:  works, it will be called discovery. Plus HBO, max, CNN. It's like,

640
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,330
Speaker 2:  that will be the name of this app

641
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,370
Speaker 1:  Disco max plus.

642
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,900
Speaker 5:  It's interesting because for them bundling is like just a path to, to the

643
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,260
Speaker 5:  merging. And like Disney is over there. Disney's been bubbling for a while.

644
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,010
Speaker 5:  They've got Hulu and ESPN plus and everything together. And like they have

645
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,310
Speaker 5:  zero interest in combining all of those together.

646
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,910
Speaker 1:  So they do so in markets that are not the United States, Hulu is basically

647
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:56,780
Speaker 1:  integrated in Disney plus, which leads to very weird moments inside the Disney

648
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,530
Speaker 1:  plus app where it's like, whoa, that's a little spicy for Disney.

649
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:00,890
Speaker 1:  Plus

650
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:04,760
Speaker 5:  We call it also like stars plus and a lot of markets.

651
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,210
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Cause they've got that. They've had another whole content arm. That's

652
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:08,840
Speaker 1:  international.

653
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,230
Speaker 5:  They're partially doing it in the United States at least because they want

654
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:16,100
Speaker 5:  everybody to still think of Disney as like for princesses and superheroes.

655
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,750
Speaker 5:  And they want Hulu to be for adults.

656
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,450
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But I'm saying if you leave the United States and you open Disney,

657
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,790
Speaker 1:  plus there's a real chance it's going, gonna be like Pam and Tommy is here.

658
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,640
Speaker 1:  That's weird. She's not a Disney princess.

659
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,200
Speaker 5:  She could be.

660
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,340
Speaker 1:  I remember she is at this point,

661
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,420
Speaker 5:  Aspirational,

662
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,750
Speaker 1:  But know Disney. The United States right now is like undergoing this massive

663
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,230
Speaker 1:  culture war attack that might be destroying that like they're in a tough

664
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,050
Speaker 1:  spot with that bundle, but they also sort of acquired

665
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,980
Speaker 1:  their way into that bundle. Like they launched the Hulu is like a part

666
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,550
Speaker 1:  ownership. They can't integrate it. Now they have more of its catalog. You

667
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,430
Speaker 1:  can see where they're going over time. ESPN is going to be its own thing.

668
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,180
Speaker 1:  Always. I think, anyway, this is all just shaking out. I feel bad for the

669
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,840
Speaker 1:  people at CNN, although they did cover their own streaming service

670
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,560
Speaker 1:  launch, just like a completely ridiculous way. Fair. I feel bad.

671
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,830
Speaker 1:  We should feel bad. They're laying people off. People are going to have to

672
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,570
Speaker 1:  find new jobs inside of that company. Or

673
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,460
Speaker 5:  400 people got laid off, I think.

674
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,960
Speaker 1:  Is that the number? So that's all bad, but 23 days

675
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,980
Speaker 1:  in just a catastrophe of corporate miscommunication.

676
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,250
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

677
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,580
Speaker 2:  Well, and that's the thing. And I think it's like, it's, it's important to

678
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,240
Speaker 2:  note here and it's kind of a bummer that this is the case that this isn't

679
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:27,900
Speaker 2:  actually really about the performance of CNN. Plus like if CNN plus has come

680
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,810
Speaker 2:  out and gotten 50 million subscribers in the first month, like we might be

681
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:34,650
Speaker 2:  having a different conversation, but we also might not be because like, even,

682
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,290
Speaker 2:  even in the course of making these announcements, they've been very clear

683
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:41,280
Speaker 2:  that like this was bad strategy. This goes against

684
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,180
Speaker 2:  what this newly combined company wants to do. And it basically

685
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,090
Speaker 2:  sounds like, like you were saying, they didn't want them to launch it at

686
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:52,020
Speaker 2:  all. Jason Kylar and the CNN team, like two middle fingers to

687
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,110
Speaker 2:  discovery decided to launch it anyway on the premise that if we've already

688
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,830
Speaker 2:  launched it, they can't possibly shut it down. And then they said, oh, watch

689
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,220
Speaker 2:  this and then shut it down. And so it's like, I don't know that it has anything

690
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,610
Speaker 2:  to do with the streaming service. It's this weird, like C-suite fight that

691
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:09,120
Speaker 2:  just spilled out into shutting down CNN plus, which is

692
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,810
Speaker 2:  crazy.

693
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,860
Speaker 1:  Yeah. In the middle of all this Jeff sucker who ran CNN

694
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,250
Speaker 1:  was one presumes. If he had launched it and was it

695
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,300
Speaker 1:  discovery, Warner media or whatever, it's called. Things may have gone

696
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,360
Speaker 1:  differently because he was just a personality. But he got run out of there

697
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,930
Speaker 1:  to like right

698
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,420
Speaker 2:  And discovered. It was also reportedly mad that he got run out the way that

699
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,410
Speaker 2:  he did like the whole process. They seem to do all this stuff before

700
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,890
Speaker 2:  they had new overlords and the new overlords were not fans.

701
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:38,640
Speaker 1:  Maybe I need to rename the chart to like the Jeff Zucker Memorial doing the

702
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,360
Speaker 1:  streaming service.

703
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,690
Speaker 1:  I'm going to say, we'd go 90 a pioneer in the field of doom streaming services.

704
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,360
Speaker 1:  Remember kids, when you watch a video go 90,

705
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,850
Speaker 1:  We should very quickly talk about like the other side of the streaming world,

706
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:57,810
Speaker 1:  which is podcasts that is undergoing change to Spotify as head

707
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:01,350
Speaker 1:  of podcasts left Courtney Holt. He was the one who brought

708
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,370
Speaker 1:  in Joe Rogan's and other deals notably signed the Obama deal,

709
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,630
Speaker 1:  a Bama leaving Spotify for another as yet unannounced deal. A

710
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,600
Speaker 1:  lot of those deals have not borne fruit, right. They, they bought themselves

711
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,530
Speaker 1:  a sort of, always on Joe Rogan noise machine. And

712
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,860
Speaker 1:  like, sometimes it's like louder and sometimes it's quieter, but it's always

713
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,790
Speaker 1:  on, there's just always a level of white noise coming out of the Joe Rogan

714
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,600
Speaker 1:  machine that they bought.

715
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,590
Speaker 5:  Have we gotten the Harry and Meghan podcasts that they bought?

716
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,680
Speaker 1:  No, but they, they like assigned people to it

717
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,110
Speaker 2:  And they make like one episode and then never again. And now supposedly they're

718
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,130
Speaker 2:  doing it for real.

719
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,310
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like our 12 media, their thing is going to do something. So the person

720
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,850
Speaker 1:  who signed all these deals is leaving. The Obama's are leaving and they're

721
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,480
Speaker 1:  opening up. They bought this tool called anchor, which is their like user

722
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,320
Speaker 1:  generated podcasting tool. Now anchors and let you start

723
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,070
Speaker 1:  uploading video podcasts ever in the United States and other markets. I would

724
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,760
Speaker 1:  just say that on the spectrum of companies that have figured out their

725
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,720
Speaker 1:  approach to content moderation, there's YouTube, which is like,

726
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,860
Speaker 1:  kind of figured it out still not great because content moderation is unsolved.

727
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,790
Speaker 1:  And then way over there across the ocean in a

728
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,600
Speaker 1:  volcano is Spotify being like, we don't know what we're doing.

729
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,550
Speaker 5:  We're a tech company,

730
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,600
Speaker 1:  The combo platter of unmoderated open podcasting and

731
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,200
Speaker 1:  unmoderated video is just going to open them up to a

732
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,900
Speaker 1:  world of chaos. So we will see how this goes.

733
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,410
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's, it's going to be a mess. I will say. I think there's this really

734
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,920
Speaker 2:  interesting race happening right now where YouTube is pretty clearly investing

735
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,910
Speaker 2:  in like the audio experience based on the theory that a lot of

736
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,520
Speaker 2:  people want to watch podcasts. And a lot of people wanna listen to podcasts.

737
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,490
Speaker 2:  And I feel like, I think that's pretty clearly real and YouTube is trying

738
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,180
Speaker 2:  to solve how to transition into like an audio first

739
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:50,170
Speaker 2:  experience while Spotify is trying to figure out how to make video work.

740
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,190
Speaker 2:  And if I were a betting man, I would, I would push all of my

741
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,120
Speaker 2:  chips in the YouTube side of that fight. But I think spot, I

742
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,270
Speaker 2:  think this is the right thing for Spotify to do. I think the moderation is

743
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,050
Speaker 2:  gonna be a mess and Spotify is approach. It has an approach. It is chilling

744
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,930
Speaker 2:  in a volcano, but its approach is to chill in the volcano and hope you don't

745
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,380
Speaker 2:  notice. And to say, we think moderation is important and then

746
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,330
Speaker 2:  disappear into the wilderness.

747
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,720
Speaker 1:  Here's what I'll tell you again. I decoders a podcast with org charts. It's

748
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,230
Speaker 1:  like, that's the secret of Dakota. It's just me being like, what's your org

749
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:23,470
Speaker 1:  chart. And then like asking a lot of questions. YouTube is moderation. It's

750
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,430
Speaker 1:  run by the head of product, trust and safety at YouTube reports to

751
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:31,030
Speaker 1:  the head of product it's in the product organization. So unique arrangement

752
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,840
Speaker 1:  and all the tack, it's like 50, 50, you know, but like product is

753
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,530
Speaker 1:  like a meaningful place for that to live. That's on the roadmaps that is

754
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,490
Speaker 1:  literally baked into the product of YouTube, Spotify, trust and

755
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,320
Speaker 1:  safety reports to coms.

756
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,870
Speaker 1:  I don't know about that, man. It's just like one of those

757
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,600
Speaker 1:  things, like I can just tell you that maybe all the people are great, whatever,

758
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,200
Speaker 1:  but just that structure is like, you think this is a comms PR you think there's

759
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,100
Speaker 1:  a PR problem, not a product problem. And like, I can just tell you

760
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,270
Speaker 1:  that based on where you've put it.

761
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,090
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And they very clearly do. And that's been their response even to Joe

762
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,390
Speaker 2:  Rogan, things like that. They see it sort of as a, as a hurdle to get past,

763
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,620
Speaker 2:  not as a problem to solve.

764
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,370
Speaker 1:  I was just like interesting that they're still chasing after it. And they

765
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:16,180
Speaker 1:  are the 800 pound gorilla in podcasting. They seem to

766
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,510
Speaker 1:  be driving a lot of things, but they true that they have not figured it out.

767
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,540
Speaker 2:  Definitely true. But the good news for them is I don't know that anyone has

768
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,140
Speaker 2:  like pot, the podcasting infrastructure across the whole internet is still

769
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,890
Speaker 2:  such a disaster that like Spotify should be better at it. But

770
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,440
Speaker 2:  I don't know that it's behind, which is so crazy.

771
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,420
Speaker 1:  Let's take this to say that if you're interested in podcasts, we have a paid

775
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,830
Speaker 1:  to be, you'll see her on the verge assay That shameless plug for our own

776

Speaker 1:  work is a good time to take a break. We get to talk about some guidance.

811
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,810
Speaker 1:  All right. We're back. Chris Welch has joined us. Hello

812
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:00,260
Speaker 8:  Everyone.

813
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:04,190
Speaker 1:  We just said 45 minutes of corporate streaming strategy. So it's time to

814
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,860
Speaker 1:  clear our pallets old-fashioned gadget scoop.

815
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,180
Speaker 1:  Chris is scooped a new soundbar from Sonus. Tell us what's going on.

816
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,780
Speaker 8:  Yeah, so I don't know what it's called just yet. That's the one thing they

817
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,060
Speaker 8:  can actually say for the announcement.

818
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,190
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I see a shit

819
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,720
Speaker 8:  That's similar to Patrick. Spence is just staring at the wall in his office.

820
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,020
Speaker 8:  Very

821
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,480
Speaker 1:  Frustrated. He's got a picture of you up on that wall.

822
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,840
Speaker 8:  So it's going to be their cheapest soundbar yet. Actually it's going to cost

823
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,740
Speaker 8:  $249 and it's smaller than the beam, which means it's pretty tiny. Cause

824
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,190
Speaker 8:  like seeing the beam in person is like, you just, it's a tiny little soundbar

825
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,640
Speaker 8:  and this one is four inches smaller. So it's got quite a few less drivers.

826
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,850
Speaker 8:  There's no Atmos, you know, there's no Mike's built in. So it's going to

827
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:51,810
Speaker 8:  be like a pretty rudimentary, just TBM music soundbar and it'll come out

828
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,800
Speaker 8:  sometime in June. I believe. So there are photos on the site, take a look.

829
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,470
Speaker 8:  So I think they're just going after that really cheap market, like videos

830
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,980
Speaker 8:  and you know, like Roku and TCL, soundbars and, and that's who they're really

831
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,790
Speaker 8:  going for with this.

832
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,990
Speaker 5:  I get taking out the microphones and a lot of the other processing and stuff.

833
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:10,800
Speaker 5:  Cause it doesn't do Atmos, but why go so small? Because

834
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,520
Speaker 5:  the whole point of speakers is the bigger, the better the sound couldn't

835
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,940
Speaker 5:  they do bigger speakers without jacking up the price. Oh

836
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:21,150
Speaker 8:  No. I think they just see this as like for pretty, fairly small TVs. Same

837
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,390
Speaker 8:  as the beam. So if you've got like a giant sixty-five or like 75 inch TV,

838
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,360
Speaker 8:  you go for the arch. If you've got something smaller, you go for one of these

839
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:27,540
Speaker 8:  two.

840
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah, because these are like 20, you have you're in the measurements.

841
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,370
Speaker 5:  550 millimeters width. And the beam two is 651.

842
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:39,150
Speaker 5:  That's like 25 inches. I definitely searched that guys. I do

843
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:43,120
Speaker 5:  not just switch between millimeters and inches. And my head is

844
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,090
Speaker 2:  To be very impressive. I

845
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:48,060
Speaker 5:  Was, I had to let everybody know, but yeah, that's like, that's a

846
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,710
Speaker 5:  tiny baby of a speaker.

847
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,100
Speaker 8:  It's a tiny little thing. And one of the things is as there's a new Mount

848
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,820
Speaker 8:  for there, so you can Mount it vertically. And so they think people are going

849
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,540
Speaker 8:  to like buy two of these, to use what the arch as like rear surrounds. And

850
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,210
Speaker 8:  if you look closely at the image, you'll see like the tweeters are like curved.

851
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,790
Speaker 8:  So like when you Mount it vertically, it might do a better job of like just

852
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,300
Speaker 8:  sending audio upwards toward the ceiling. Like something like a one SL or

853
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,390
Speaker 8:  one of those speakers. So if you want to spend $500,

854
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,550
Speaker 1:  Oh I see us again, bounce off the ceiling.

855
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,050
Speaker 8:  Yeah. On your surrounds.

856
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,500
Speaker 5:  So you would use these instead of like right now, if you're really

857
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,460
Speaker 5:  into building a 5.1 Sonos system, because you have all the money

858
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,180
Speaker 5:  in the world, you would do like two Sonos fives. Right.

859
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:31,260
Speaker 5:  And now you'll be able to do these much cheaper actually built for

860
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,280
Speaker 5:  movie audio.

861
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,570
Speaker 1:  Well, yeah, the best part of this entire Sonos thing is like anything you

862
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,310
Speaker 1:  can have like lamps, the surrounds cause they make the speaker lamps

863
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,180
Speaker 8:  Picture frames.

864
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:41,910
Speaker 1:  But this is like soon they're going after like the dorm room market or like

865
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,260
Speaker 1:  the second bedroom market here.

866
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,500
Speaker 2:  What is the state of that market right now? I feel like it's, it's been a

867
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,650
Speaker 2:  while since I bought a soundbar, but my impression of it is like, you can

868
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,430
Speaker 2:  get a pretty good soundbar at this point for not a lot of money. Like does

869
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:54,900
Speaker 2:  Sonos have a move here?

870
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,300
Speaker 8:  I mean, I think they want to have a move. I think busy was kind of own this

871
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,720
Speaker 8:  whole space for years and now they've got like Roku and you know, some other

872
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,900
Speaker 8:  companies like TCL coming in as well with like, you know, $99,

873
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,710
Speaker 8:  $150 soundbars and Sonos won't go quite that low. It seems like they're kind

874
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:10,920
Speaker 8:  of like apple in that they will only go so low for a product price, but two

875
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,250
Speaker 8:  50 for a Sono soundbar. Now it sounds like a pretty good gateway.

876
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,790
Speaker 2:  So it does definitely does have the shiny brand where like, I think if you

877
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:21,420
Speaker 2:  just, if you just show people a Vizio thing and a Sonos thing, they'll mostly

878
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,130
Speaker 2:  just assume the Sonos thing is better.

879
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,030
Speaker 1:  The vision thing is always really funny cause they will like the Vizio

880
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:30,340
Speaker 1:  soundbars are fine. They sound really good. Some of them great, but like

881
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,940
Speaker 1:  the classic one is like, you know, the long box with a big hump for the

882
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,810
Speaker 1:  subwoofer. Yep. Or like here's like half a dozen weird

883
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:40,030
Speaker 1:  little speakers with like the fiddly wires

884
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,970
Speaker 2:  And it sort of hangs off the edge of your TV stand. Yeah.

885
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,690
Speaker 1:  And then like people buy them. People have always bought those kids. Like,

886
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:49,840
Speaker 1:  but that's like we're Vizio. I think Sonos wants to be that sort of like

887
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:53,620
Speaker 1:  premium plug it in once we just assume that over time you

888
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,860
Speaker 1:  will have more money and have more rooms in your house. And we'll just follow

889
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,700
Speaker 1:  you along that chain.

890
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,370
Speaker 5:  I'm still going back to the fact that it doesn't have microphones. Cause

891
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:04,300
Speaker 5:  it seems like Sonos kind of finally abandoning, oh, we're going to be

892
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,210
Speaker 5:  the voice assistant hub in your home.

893
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:10,570
Speaker 8:  I don't know. I think like the other two do have like spelt in and also like

894
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:13,570
Speaker 8:  they make like the arch SL you can buy at Costco that like doesn't have Mike's

895
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,010
Speaker 8:  there just some people who like don't want

896
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:18,640
Speaker 5:  Right. That like, they, they make a lot of those now, but this is like a

897
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,730
Speaker 5:  new speaker from them. This is one of the first speakers I think we've seen

898
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,650
Speaker 5:  from them without these microphones. So it's like,

899
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,830
Speaker 1:  They make the one SL then make the ARCA. So they've been pretty clear. Like

900
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:29,020
Speaker 1:  some people do not want more microphones in their house

901
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:34,090
Speaker 1:  If you're, and I think they've also learned like, what do people do with

902
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:37,510
Speaker 1:  microphones? They ask for music. And so like, it's, it's actually kind of

903
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:41,500
Speaker 1:  like odd to have it in your sound bar. Maybe this one would have

904
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,230
Speaker 1:  worked, but like that's how you get the price down. The thing that really

905
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:47,740
Speaker 1:  gets me about this whole thing is we've also seen all these rumors that they're

906
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,440
Speaker 1:  hiring people for like a home theater. Oh, us.

907
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:55,810
Speaker 1:  Right. And they've put up job listings. They've been tweeting about

908
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,540
Speaker 1:  it. Some of their employees have been tweeting about it that like, this is

909
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,320
Speaker 1:  just a regular plug in a sandbar to your arc port off you go. There's

910
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,310
Speaker 1:  no operating system or anything. But that next big move from

911
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,970
Speaker 1:  Sonos has got to be either a streaming box,

912
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,470
Speaker 1:  a smart soundbar, or, you know, I'm going to say now the

913
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:16,930
Speaker 1:  TV, every company should make a TV.

914
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,260
Speaker 2:  Everyone should see the face. Chris is making right now. Like when you said

915
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,860
Speaker 2:  the O S Chris got like visibly excited,

916
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,250
Speaker 1:  Do you think it's really TV? I think it's really TV.

917
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,370
Speaker 8:  I don't want a TV. I just want a cheaper subwoofer man. And apparently are

918
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:33,670
Speaker 8:  working on that. The sub mini. And it would make sense to have that come

919
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,410
Speaker 8:  out with this at the same time. I think. Yeah,

920
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,190
Speaker 5:  Because right now it's like $700 for a Sono sub

921
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:39,490
Speaker 5:  that's

922
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:39,880
Speaker 8:  Absurd.

923
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,070
Speaker 5:  It's really, really good. It sounds amazing.

924
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,030
Speaker 8:  $250 soundbar. Now you just have to buy a $700 of warfare to go with,

925
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:50,660
Speaker 1:  But there's a lot of people online that will find a ways to hack other subs.

926
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,370
Speaker 1:  And they're working with sense. Like you can there, I will just be

927
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:57,970
Speaker 1:  careful kids. Like you're going to break up that soldering iron. You're going

928
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:01,810
Speaker 1:  to disassemble a one Sonos, one SL or like

929
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,740
Speaker 1:  my Kia lamp to make her sub before. We're just like, be careful. I'm

930
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,520
Speaker 1:  just adding value. Save yourself. Yeah. But the idea that they need to expand

931
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,460
Speaker 1:  their market, I mean, this is kinda what we're saying, that this is a super

932
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,940
Speaker 1:  competitive market. They can make cheaper products and get a new base of

933
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:19,120
Speaker 1:  people. But at the end of the day, they're always plugging into somebody

934
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:23,080
Speaker 1:  else's TV. They're always at somebody else's mercy, somebody else's

935
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,980
Speaker 1:  streaming box. There's only one answer, man. Patrick, if you're listening,

936
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,940
Speaker 1:  make me that Ola TV,

937
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,940
Speaker 5:  It's going to be the box. It's going to be the streaming box.

938
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,140
Speaker 2:  It's going to be the box.

939
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:33,920
Speaker 1:  You think it's a box.

940
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,850
Speaker 2:  It's gotta be a box. Like a, I think Sonos has a lot to gain

941
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,240
Speaker 2:  from a future where you have dumb screens and smart boxes

942
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,590
Speaker 2:  and would be very interested in being those smart boxes. I

943
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:49,250
Speaker 2:  also think that is the correct future. Like stop selling me smart TVs,

944
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,910
Speaker 2:  sell me smart boxes and dumb screens. That will last me a decade. No,

945
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,080
Speaker 1:  One's going to sell you a dumb screen.

946
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,350
Speaker 2:  I know. And I would, I wish they would. And maybe Sonos will.

947
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,440
Speaker 5:  We want you to buy a new TV every time your screen gets too dumb.

948
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:04,610
Speaker 2:  Third Roku update. I have to buy a new television. It's fantastic. But no,

949
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:08,360
Speaker 2:  I also just think like if I'm Sonos, the TV

950
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:12,320
Speaker 2:  market is a mess, especially right now, and it's not going to

951
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,830
Speaker 2:  get better quickly. And like they could build

952
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,790
Speaker 2:  better home theater software without trying very hard, because most of it

953
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:23,300
Speaker 2:  is trash and Sonus has a pretty good track record of building good software

954
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:27,740
Speaker 2:  and then put it in a box and sell it to the same kinds of people who would

955
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,070
Speaker 2:  buy something like this. And that feels like Sona seems to just be

956
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:35,030
Speaker 2:  relentlessly pushing down in the market. And that feels like where it

957
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:38,370
Speaker 2:  thinks all its growth is. And I don't know that Neela has all led TV assaults

958
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:38,510
Speaker 2:  that

959
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,790
Speaker 1:  I let me make the opposite problem. We'll let crispy the judge. You ready?

960
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,470
Speaker 1:  Okay. Yeah. There's the opposite argument selling a box in a

961
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:49,400
Speaker 1:  market where Roku and Amazon will just give you one for

962
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,790
Speaker 1:  free. And they are already, the market leaders is

963
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:56,630
Speaker 1:  stupid, Right? Like you like blink at

964
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:59,030
Speaker 1:  Amazon. You're like, huh? I'm interested in bookstore. They're like, have

965
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:00,290
Speaker 1:  you heard about prime TV? Here's one.

966
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:01,250
Speaker 2:  That one just appears at your

967
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:05,120
Speaker 1:  Door. It's just like happened to you. Right? Roku. Like their entire business

968
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,600
Speaker 1:  is giving away that hardware for is cheapest possible and subsidizing with

969
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,360
Speaker 1:  ads and all this other stuff they want to do being in a business where you're

970
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,930
Speaker 1:  selling a box and you've got to make a new software experience. And you're

971
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,180
Speaker 1:  still just kind of at the end of the day, just like looking at your same

972
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,390
Speaker 1:  old TV. That's not like Sonus.

973
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,950
Speaker 1:  Sonus is like experience and like the

974
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:27,530
Speaker 1:  speakers. I, you know, I have a lot of Sonos speakers. I think they're great.

975
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:30,800
Speaker 1:  I think the company is great. I think it all works great, but they're not

976
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,900
Speaker 1:  the best sounding speakers you can get. Always.

977
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:36,890
Speaker 5:  No, they're actually not that great. Like I currently have a

978
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:40,760
Speaker 5:  5.1 Sonos system and almost every night I spend way

979
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,570
Speaker 5:  too much time trying to figure out what bookshelves, speakers, or

980
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:48,200
Speaker 5:  giant towers I'm going to get to replace it and move from like 5.1 to two,

981
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:51,620
Speaker 5:  because all the home theater nerds are like, you know what your speakers

982
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:55,190
Speaker 5:  suck. And I truly believe them. I like haven't heard

983
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:56,060
Speaker 5:  comparisons,

984
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,500
Speaker 1:  But like you're on the AVS.

985
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,430
Speaker 5:  Like convinced me, man. I'm like, no, I get it. I get it.

986
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,580
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like a, a great 2.1 system is better than a son. That's why for me,

987
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,360
Speaker 1:  like, I've been there.

988
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:09,020
Speaker 5:  I'm like, I'm there right now. The only reason I haven't done it is because

989
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,050
Speaker 5:  I have neighbors and I don't think they would be as excited about my new

990
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:13,220
Speaker 5:  speakers as I will be.

991
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,940
Speaker 1:  But what I'm saying is Sonos owns the brand in the best buy

992
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:21,020
Speaker 1:  of one of the best things you can buy that has a complete experience. It

993
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,740
Speaker 1:  makes you fancy and trying to sell, like trying to hock

994
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:28,650
Speaker 1:  some box at people. That's like, that's why he got to build the

995
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,800
Speaker 1:  TV and be like, this is the best TV you can get. Cause it has our brand on

996
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,250
Speaker 1:  it and it's got our software in it. And then you sell a lot of

997
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,850
Speaker 1:  those. And then he go to the atrium acts of the world. And like, you want

998
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,490
Speaker 1:  to be on our TV. Cause everyone likes you. You got to pass the money. No,

999
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,000
Speaker 5:  It's going to be a box. It's going to be a really, it's going to be the

1000
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,750
Speaker 5:  Cabo was at Cabo. The HTMI for us. Well, we

1001
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,470
Speaker 8:  Were promised,

1002
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,880
Speaker 1:  But the Cabo has not pivoted to a, like a assistive tech for older people,

1003
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,270
Speaker 1:  I think. Oh,

1004
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:54,450
Speaker 2:  That's

1005
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:54,960
Speaker 5:  Awesome.

1006
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:58,560
Speaker 1:  I get an email from them every now and again, being like you can't wait to

1007
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,830
Speaker 1:  show you. And I'm like, okay, if we can, I would love to see a software update

1008
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,590
Speaker 1:  for the one I bought my mom. Look, I'm just saying, if you're going to build

1009
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:08,520
Speaker 1:  that thing the way to package it, isn't a new kind of, isn't a TV people

1010
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,940
Speaker 1:  like things. If you, if you send us some Android TV box with a skin on it,

1011
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,500
Speaker 1:  like, come on, don't be doing that. All right,

1012
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,580
Speaker 1:  Chris, you've heard the arguments. You're the judge. Which way do you

1013
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,150
Speaker 1:  think it's going?

1014
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,910
Speaker 8:  I don't know if it's a sound idea, but I go with the TV,

1015
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:26,640
Speaker 1:  Gotta be the TV,

1016
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,950
Speaker 8:  But first we'll come this in June. And then these headphones that they've

1017
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:34,740
Speaker 8:  been working on for years apparently are taking quite a long time, hit the

1018
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,000
Speaker 8:  market. So hopefully those will be,

1019
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:40,020
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I'm no longer convinced. That's real. I think it's, it's just, I've

1020
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,760
Speaker 2:  given up on. So, and I said, we're making headphones.

1021
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,280
Speaker 8:  I think there are challenges there. Like how do you do handoff from like

1022
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,220
Speaker 8:  headphones to a speaker to that phones have wifi. Like where do you go from

1023
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,890
Speaker 8:  there? So I think there's a lot to figure out in terms of like that

1024
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:53,010
Speaker 5:  Headphones always just seemed very stupid. Like that always just seemed like

1025
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:56,730
Speaker 5:  a bad idea. It just from the beginning, it's like, we're going to do

1026
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,390
Speaker 5:  we're in speakers. So we're going to go for tiny speakers on your ears.

1027
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:04,890
Speaker 1:  No, this is like the Dyson story. Dyson's like we invented a fan. What things

1028
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:07,620
Speaker 1:  suck or blow. We'll just make all of those things.

1029
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:11,580
Speaker 1:  It's up to say like when Dyson was like, we're going to do a car, like they

1030
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:15,340
Speaker 1:  quicker the, I was like, oh, the fan is not the most important part of

1031
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:20,580
Speaker 1:  we're way up for taps guys. Fan powered cars are never

1032
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,780
Speaker 5:  Just blowing across the highway.

1033
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,490
Speaker 1:  Oh boy, this prototype is not what we thought was going to

1034
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,210
Speaker 5:  Be loud.

1035
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:35,320
Speaker 1:  It's like 500 air apps like it on the back of the tape. I said, it's

1036
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,750
Speaker 5:  Going in circles.

1037
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,140
Speaker 2:  Sounds amazing though. All

1038
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:44,010
Speaker 1:  Right. So, which I think ended

1039
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:48,000
Speaker 1:  in the only place, it could be a bunch of other gadget stuff. David, you

1040
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,450
Speaker 1:  were really taken with a story still thinking about the civic

1041
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,230
Speaker 1:  fans. I apologize, David, you were quite taken with this story about

1042
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,380
Speaker 1:  LG leaving and how it benefited Samsung. I just

1043
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,960
Speaker 2:  Think it was fascinating. So basically the thrust of the story was

1044
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,300
Speaker 1:  This Allison Johnson story. Yeah.

1045
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah. She went to find out basically what happened to the

1046
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,930
Speaker 2:  smartphone market after LG left and did a bunch of really

1047
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:12,480
Speaker 2:  great reporting, found out a bunch virtual, really funny stuff, and essentially

1048
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,390
Speaker 2:  got to the end of it. And it was like, well it was already a two horse race

1049
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:17,190
Speaker 2:  and now it is still a two horse race. And

1050
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,510
Speaker 2:  The thing that was so striking to me is like, it just made me realize like

1051
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:25,420
Speaker 2:  those of us who cover phones, we think about it as this like big

1052
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:28,790
Speaker 2:  teaming market, full of lots of companies. And you have the big guys, you

1053
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,410
Speaker 2:  have the challengers and the actual like facts on the ground are that there

1054
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:36,040
Speaker 2:  are apple and there are, is Samsung. And absolutely nobody else matters.

1055
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,030
Speaker 2:  And they come and they go and everybody gets really excited about one

1056
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,640
Speaker 2:  plus. And then nobody buys one plus phones and we all move on with our lives.

1057
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:46,570
Speaker 2:  And it just it's, it's also really incredible hat to

1058
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,530
Speaker 2:  me, how much of everything that happens in the Android market just accrues

1059
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:54,400
Speaker 2:  to Samsung. Like it has just so decimated the rest of

1060
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,030
Speaker 2:  that market, that anything that happens to anybody else, somehow a cruise

1061
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:00,640
Speaker 2:  to Samsung. And it was just really eye-opening to read that story for me.

1062
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:04,480
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's fascinating. I mean, I like to blame carriers for this, right?

1063
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,170
Speaker 1:  Like United States, like a carrier has to certify your phone. They've got

1064
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:11,650
Speaker 1:  to approve it for the network they get in between you, but even in other

1065
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:15,490
Speaker 1:  countries where there's theoretically more competition, I don't

1066
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:16,900
Speaker 1:  know, kind of just a cruise to Samsung.

1067
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,960
Speaker 2:  And all of a sudden it made me realize like Samsung has made a lot of noise

1068
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,590
Speaker 2:  with its mid-range phones over the last couple of years. And this story really

1069
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,980
Speaker 2:  sort of opened up why. And it's like, because Samsung realizes it's just

1070
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,970
Speaker 2:  going to beat everyone out of the market as long as it has a phone at

1071
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,450
Speaker 2:  the same price point. And so it's just going to have phones at every $10

1072
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:38,410
Speaker 2:  from a billion-dollar foldable phone all the way down to 50

1073
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,660
Speaker 2:  bucks. And that'll be that,

1074
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,660
Speaker 1:  That will be that other little guys itself. We'll just talk about. And there's

1075
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,470
Speaker 1:  a leak of the pixel. Watch we thinking it'll be next

1076
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:50,200
Speaker 1:  month. That IO it's a circle.

1077
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,920
Speaker 5:  It looks like the LG watch the really bad

1078
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:57,970
Speaker 5:  LG watch from 2017. I hope that's not true.

1079
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,540
Speaker 1:  I mean, I like it. It's got a very Google like that. Watch had already had

1080
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,870
Speaker 1:  a very Google look to it. This watch has a very Google too. I liked that

1081
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:08,800
Speaker 1:  they've added this crown every time I see a crown on a smart

1082
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,680
Speaker 1:  watch. I think back to when apple announced the apple watch,

1083
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,820
Speaker 5:  They invented it. You know,

1084
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:16,900
Speaker 1:  We were told that the digital crown was the next grade and put method

1085
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,000
Speaker 1:  on par with the mouse and touch screen.

1086
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,200
Speaker 5:  You don't believe it.

1087
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,270
Speaker 2:  You can twist it and press it.

1088
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,970
Speaker 1:  Just go back and watch that. Something like that. Obviously they have a watch.

1089
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:31,960
Speaker 1:  They've rebooted it since it's very successful. People love it.

1090
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,530
Speaker 1:  I get it. But did you go back in time and watch that and be like, oh, this

1091
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:39,250
Speaker 1:  is the definition of the words I hear and supply. Like you really believe

1092
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,890
Speaker 1:  that you invented the mouse again. I think we'll see this watch, you know,

1093
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:45,700
Speaker 1:  the big question for the pixel watch always we've been hearing rumors

1094
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:49,630
Speaker 1:  forever is like, can they get

1095
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:53,530
Speaker 1:  the battery life? And so like just general support

1096
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,430
Speaker 1:  that the apple watch has rounded. They do have Fitbit now we'll see, right?

1097
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:00,610
Speaker 1:  Like it's been a long time coming for Android. Smartwatches

1098
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,140
Speaker 5:  Acquired enough stuff at this point. That be kind of sad if they can't get

1099
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:07,930
Speaker 5:  it right. Or at least chase apples coattails

1100
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:08,650
Speaker 5:  better.

1101
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:12,790
Speaker 2:  Well, and I think they've realized that the thing that apple took a

1102
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:16,600
Speaker 2:  long time to realize is like, it's tell me at the time it's

1103
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,590
Speaker 2:  due like basic dumb assistant stuff. And it's health. Like

1104
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,810
Speaker 2:  those seem to be the things that people want from their watches. And I feel

1105
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,290
Speaker 2:  like Google is at least as well, positioned as apple to actually successfully

1106
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:30,740
Speaker 2:  do some of those things. All the other crap. I don't care about like every

1107
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,560
Speaker 2:  time I get an apple watch, I put a million apps on it and I never use them

1108
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:37,430
Speaker 2:  ever. I just want it to do like four things. And I

1109
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:41,240
Speaker 2:  feel like if I'm Google and I had a, I had a long talk with a Google

1110
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,230
Speaker 2:  executive, like years ago now about this. And they're basically like, what?

1111
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,630
Speaker 2:  Like if you were going to make a smart watch, what would you do? And I was

1112
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:51,290
Speaker 2:  like less, like much, much less. And

1113
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:55,010
Speaker 2:  I, I have no idea how this will land, but just from like, if they're going

1114
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:58,940
Speaker 2:  to do the simpler thing, which is kind of the move with pixel

1115
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,550
Speaker 2:  in general, I could be into it. I don't know, Chris, what do you think? You're,

1116
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:05,540
Speaker 2:  you're into dumb smartwatches as much as I am, or at least once

1117
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:05,950
Speaker 2:  we're

1118
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,190
Speaker 8:  I once was a pebble person back in the day, but I've had the apple watch

1119
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:13,400
Speaker 8:  for a few years. Obviously. I think, I mean, it sounds like a good recipe,

1120
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,850
Speaker 8:  but like you said, with phones before, the only thing that stands in their

1121
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:20,210
Speaker 8:  way at Samsung, like Sam Sam's watches business does really well. And I'm

1122
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,610
Speaker 8:  not sure like how big that market is, the people who don't want a Samsung

1123
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:26,180
Speaker 8:  watch and want the pixel so-called watch. We'll see. But yeah, I think if

1124
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,130
Speaker 8:  they go big on Fitbit stuff, that'll be a hit

1125
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:31,130
Speaker 2:  It's the galaxy watch any good? I have not used it ever.

1126
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,180
Speaker 8:  Apparently it is. People

1127
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:32,930
Speaker 2:  Seem to like it. Yeah.

1128
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:36,980
Speaker 5:  No, the galaxy watches like really, really good. Yeah. Victoria

1129
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,730
Speaker 5:  song reviews, all those watches and she's still like, this is the

1130
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:44,300
Speaker 5:  best Android watch you can get. It looks like a real watch for the most part.

1131
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,530
Speaker 5:  It's huge.

1132
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:45,860
Speaker 1:  See,

1133
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:49,190
Speaker 2:  This is the thing, This is the bar. Like my watch, it looks like a watch.

1134
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:50,480
Speaker 2:  It tells me the time it's like,

1135
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,320
Speaker 5:  That's the bar. You don't need a lot from your watch. I mean, I was just

1136
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,960
Speaker 5:  looking at all the apps on my watch while you're, while you're talking about

1137
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:00,440
Speaker 5:  all the apps we never use. Like when was the last time you used the walkie-talkie

1138
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:00,740
Speaker 5:  app?

1139
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,450
Speaker 1:  I use it every day. What you taught your kids

1140
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:06,320
Speaker 5:  Only like when you want to inflict violence on family members,

1141
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,980
Speaker 1:  Second, you have a child and then you spend all day in your house.

1142
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,360
Speaker 1:  Raising said, child, the walkie talkie app starts to become like a

1143
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:18,290
Speaker 1:  key parenting tool. And there's literally nothing funnier than

1144
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:21,290
Speaker 1:  your wrist or opting with your wife going code brown.

1145
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:26,030
Speaker 1:  That was like a hilarious part of the first two years of Max's life

1146
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,890
Speaker 1:  All the time. Yeah. We use it all the time.

1147
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,820
Speaker 2:  I feel like that's slightly less monstrous than the people who use the drop-in

1148
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:38,630
Speaker 2:  features on like Alexa devices. But it's still pretty monstrous.

1149
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:41,990
Speaker 5:  I showed my mom how to use it and I had to turn it off. Cause like nine o'clock

1150
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:45,110
Speaker 5:  in the morning. I just heard Hulu from my watch.

1151
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,390
Speaker 7:  And I'm like, Nope, Nope, we're ending this.

1152
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,740
Speaker 1:  And you got to really limit it. I'm just saying kids or pets.

1153
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:55,960
Speaker 1:  It's like you're co-parenting after a child or a bet bucks.

1154
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:59,960
Speaker 1:  He comes in. And what I was gonna say is there's a new

1155
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,800
Speaker 1:  book called after Steve it's by trip Mikel. He was at the wall street journal.

1156
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,670
Speaker 1:  And I think now he's at the times and I it's coming out May 3rd, but I

1157
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:11,330
Speaker 1:  actually have a galley and a huge trumpet chocolate. This book is Johnny

1158
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:14,570
Speaker 1:  Ives doing the watch. And Apple's like

1159
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,590
Speaker 1:  journey from like fashion object to fitness object with the

1160
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:22,530
Speaker 1:  watch. This is gonna make everybody mad. Like everybody is going

1161
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:26,220
Speaker 1:  to be mad, but it's great. And like the report, I would say there's like

1162
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:30,180
Speaker 1:  very few sources for like Johnny Ives stood alone in his house. Thinking

1163
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:30,960
Speaker 1:  about the watch.

1164
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,940
Speaker 1:  You know what I mean? Once you read this book, you're like, oh, they all

1165
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:36,330
Speaker 1:  talked to him.

1166
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:40,380
Speaker 1:  I don't know if that's true. I'm not going to burn trip sources. I'm just

1167
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:43,350
Speaker 1:  saying there's very few sources for Johnny Ives stood alone

1168
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:44,340
Speaker 2:  Fair.

1169
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:49,410
Speaker 1:  And it is utterly fascinating. The story about the

1170
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:51,570
Speaker 1:  inside development of the watch, it is all contained in this book. So

1171
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:55,500
Speaker 2:  I wrote a story when I first joined wired, after I left the

1172
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,920
Speaker 2:  verge, the first big thing I wrote for wired was like, it was called the

1173
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,640
Speaker 2:  secret history of the apple watch. And I wrote, I wrote the beginning of,

1174
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,510
Speaker 2:  one of the paragraphs was apple decided to build a watch and only then set

1175
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:09,660
Speaker 2:  out to figure out what it was for an apple was mad at me about that line

1176
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,620
Speaker 2:  for like five years.

1177
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,790
Speaker 2:  Cause he was the opposite of what they want to tell you to do. Right. But

1178
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,250
Speaker 2:  they were just like somebody like Johnny rolled in one day and was like,

1179
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,710
Speaker 2:  we're going to make a watch. And they were like, what's it gonna do? And

1180
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:23,460
Speaker 2:  he was like, I don't know what it's going to be. 24 karat gold.

1181
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,730
Speaker 1:  I, again, I can't, I cannot stress enough that if you're a virtuous listener,

1182
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:33,510
Speaker 1:  you will, you will love this. It will make you mad. No matter what

1183
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,940
Speaker 1:  side of this whole thing you're on. If you're an apple fan and you're not

1184
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:39,870
Speaker 1:  apple fan, you love Johnny Ivy hate Johnny. It will make you

1185
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:40,050
Speaker 1:  mad

1186
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,900
Speaker 2:  Trips, a friend. We're going to have to find some way to get him to talk

1187
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:43,740
Speaker 2:  to us about the book. Oh,

1188
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:44,850
Speaker 1:  We should get him to come on

1189
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:46,050
Speaker 2:  The show. Yeah. That'd be fun. Yeah.

1190
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,410
Speaker 1:  The book is great. It is just when you read, like, I'm curious for you to

1191
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:52,470
Speaker 1:  take when you read it, David, like, cause if you're a reporter and editor

1192
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:54,840
Speaker 1:  and you read a book like this, like you cannot help but think about how it

1193
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,380
Speaker 1:  was sourced.

1194
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:55,830
Speaker 2:  Oh,

1195
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,700
Speaker 1:  For sure. And there's a lot of moments in this book where like, was he in

1196
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:03,690
Speaker 1:  the room? Like, it's great. I cannot recommend this book enough.

1197
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:07,530
Speaker 1:  I had, I read it basically in like one and a half sittings, but like it's

1198
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:10,680
Speaker 1:  all about the inside of the watch. And like the core problem is what do people

1199
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,310
Speaker 1:  want from the watch? They want fitness stuff and they wanna tell the time

1200
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:17,730
Speaker 1:  I hire, if you have a smart watch and you like live a two factor life, like

1201
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,800
Speaker 1:  any corporation in America or like you should

1202
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:20,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1203
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:24,690
Speaker 1:  Morally putting your two factor app on your watch is great. It's a little

1204
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:27,900
Speaker 1:  bit like you're a secret agent, but also at the most tedious corporate bullshit,

1205
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:31,230
Speaker 1:  you ever done it and have more quick gadgets off

1206
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:34,170
Speaker 1:  Google assistant was supposed to roll it to the galaxy watch for that is

1207
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:38,160
Speaker 1:  not happening. We reviewed the playdate, which is a super cool little

1208
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,050
Speaker 1:  panic with a handle.

1209
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:41,340
Speaker 5:  It's so tiny

1210
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:45,540
Speaker 1:  Game. That thing is, it seems awesome. It's very hard to get the Andrew Webster

1211
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:46,320
Speaker 1:  loved it with his

1212
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,260
Speaker 2:  Review. I'm so excited that it's good. So excited.

1213
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,420
Speaker 5:  If you didn't order it, you have to wait a year.

1214
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:53,610
Speaker 1:  The photos from the urine are amazing. The

1215
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:55,050
Speaker 5:  Photos are incredible,

1216
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,800
Speaker 1:  Intense, new Brin reference and the deck of this little yellow, different

1217
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,580
Speaker 1:  love that great story. They're not camera batteries for weird Sony cameras

1218
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:05,670
Speaker 1:  to charge a USB-C. That's a big deal. I just want to call that out. That's

1219
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:06,660
Speaker 1:  like virtuous level stuff.

1220
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,840
Speaker 5:  That's a big deal for me personally. And it's really upsetting that it took

1221
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,350
Speaker 5:  this long.

1222
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,240
Speaker 1:  All right, we're cruising over. We've got to take a break. We're gonna come

1223
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,800
Speaker 1:  back and finish this lightning round. We'll be right back.

1224
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:21,370
Speaker 9:  It's easy to get sloppy. When it comes to password security in the modern

1225
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:24,760
Speaker 9:  workplace employees log in and out of countless websites,

1226
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:28,780
Speaker 9:  programs and apps every day, maybe have used the same password

1227
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:32,410
Speaker 9:  over and over, or maybe you prefer the super secure sticky note on

1228
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:36,400
Speaker 9:  monitor solution. These small shortcuts can add up to a huge

1229
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:40,090
Speaker 9:  gap in your company's security. The most common cause of corporate data

1230
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:43,960
Speaker 9:  breaches isn't special hacking techniques or high-tech viruses.

1231
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:47,830
Speaker 9:  It often comes down to weak or stolen passwords, but keeper security can

1232
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:51,760
Speaker 9:  help protect your company's data. Their enterprise password management

01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:03,340

1260
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:41,970
Speaker 1:  Okay. We're back. Chris waltz was still here. This lightning round continues.

1261
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:44,640
Speaker 1:  This is not gonna be lightning round. I dunno. I dunno. I said it's later

1262
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,240
Speaker 1:  on the next one is Elon Musk lays out funding for Twitter takeover. David

1263
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,430
Speaker 1:  what's going on with our boy. So Lonnie,

1264
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:54,360
Speaker 2:  I don't know. So the big question about Elon Musk's

1265
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:57,330
Speaker 2:  takeover of Twitter has been what the hell is going on.

1266
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,820
Speaker 2:  The other question is, does he actually have the money to do this right?

1267
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:06,390
Speaker 2:  He wants to offer 43 billion and change.

1268
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:10,500
Speaker 2:  And as we know about Elon Musk do, does not have a lot of cash on hand,

1269
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:13,740
Speaker 2:  generally speaking, he like lives in a weird tiny trailer and all his money

1270
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,760
Speaker 2:  is tied up in Tesla stock. And he's very excited about this fact. So the

1271
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,270
Speaker 2:  question has been like, if in fact he wants to do this,

1272
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,350
Speaker 2:  how is he going to do it? And so what happened on

1273
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:28,310
Speaker 2:  Thursday was he, I think, amended an existing filing or

1274
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:31,760
Speaker 2:  did a new filing with the sec paperwork with the sec,

1275
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:35,990
Speaker 2:  basically explaining how he's going to come up with, I think 46 and a

1276
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:39,920
Speaker 2:  half billion dollars that would let him finances purchase of Twitter.

1277
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:44,060
Speaker 2:  He also said that Twitter has not responded to him and is

1278
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:47,720
Speaker 2:  sort of, he's kind of angsty about the whole thing. But basically the

1279
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:51,320
Speaker 2:  point is that I think Morgan Stanley has agreed to loan him

1280
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:55,670
Speaker 2:  $25.5 billion. And Ilan says, he's going

1281
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:59,570
Speaker 2:  to spend $21 billion of his own money. Again, we don't know exactly where

1282
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:02,330
Speaker 2:  that's coming from or how he's going to get it, or what happens to Tesla

1283
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:06,260
Speaker 2:  stock if he sells another $21 billion worth of it. But the theory

1284
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:10,250
Speaker 2:  now is at least he, you know, funding secured, right? He like has

1285
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,630
Speaker 2:  the money to buy Twitter.

1286
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:15,860
Speaker 5:  If he secretly listened to his friend, Peter and

1287
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:19,850
Speaker 5:  has just like a huge Roth IRA somewhere Just

1288
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,500
Speaker 5:  enormous Roth IRA.

1289
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,850
Speaker 1:  So what Alex is making reference to is Peter. Teal's started a Roth IRA when

1290
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:29,600
Speaker 1:  he started PayPal and put all of his PayPal stock in a Roth IRA.

1291
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:30,650
Speaker 5:  And he's so

1292
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:32,120
Speaker 1:  Much accrues tax-free

1293
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,650
Speaker 5:  For years is very good

1294
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:37,820
Speaker 1:  As well. But You know, I know, I know people are outraged with the story

1295
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:40,760
Speaker 1:  of billionaires, pay their taxes. If you have the foresight to be like, oh,

1296
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,630
Speaker 1:  PayPal is gonna be a big deal when they put it in my Roth IRA,

1297
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:48,530
Speaker 1:  like I dunno, like you're betting on yourself in a,

1298
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:52,460
Speaker 1:  in a fairly serious way at that point. It's still very funny

1299
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:56,090
Speaker 1:  now <inaudible> to pay their taxes. I'm sorry. I don't mean like, but it's

1300
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:59,570
Speaker 1:  still like good on ya, but you have to be the

1301
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,710
Speaker 2:  Player, but also hate the game

1302
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:05,240
Speaker 1:  It's like over the player was actually quite clever here, but the game is

1303
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:08,370
Speaker 1:  rigged, right? It would be amazing if you're 21

1304
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:09,620
Speaker 1:  off,

1305
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,510
Speaker 5:  They're just incredible.

1306
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:15,500
Speaker 1:  Anyhow, Twitter has the poison pill and it's actually very funny to see

1307
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,870
Speaker 1:  all the time. People who didn't realize poison pills were a things. Speaking

1308
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:20,600
Speaker 1:  of books, everyone should read barbarians at the gate, which is like one

1309
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,560
Speaker 1:  of the great 1980s corporate like novel books ever

1310
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,250
Speaker 1:  written is about the takeover of RJR Nabisco. It's like

1311
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,550
Speaker 1:  nonfiction, but it's written like a novel. It's like this inspired many things

1312
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:34,550
Speaker 1:  about our culture that it's just like working in the background. This was

1313
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:38,210
Speaker 1:  just book, talk on the verge. Now I've had a number of my kids for books,

1314
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:38,630
Speaker 1:  for you to read.

1315
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:40,700
Speaker 2:  Yeah, there is, there was so much homework on the verge cast.

1316
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:42,860
Speaker 2:  I don't know how to feel

1317
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:44,810
Speaker 5:  Signed every week,

1318
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:47,210
Speaker 2:  But what I can't figure out. I come to the end of this and it's like, okay.

1319
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,510
Speaker 2:  He continues to do things that make it seem like he genuinely wants to buy

1320
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:54,200
Speaker 2:  Twitter and is capable of buying Twitter. And this is not all like a hilarious

1321
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:57,770
Speaker 2:  drugs joke, but I get to the end of this. And I'm like, is this, I don't

1322
01:10:57,770 --> 01:11:01,700
Speaker 2:  know like w with, with Elon Musk as with everything, I have no idea

1323
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:05,420
Speaker 2:  how seriously to take anything that he does or says like, this seems

1324
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:07,550
Speaker 2:  serious, but I have no idea.

1325
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,660
Speaker 5:  I didn't actually answer the big question, which is where are the

1326
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:14,100
Speaker 5:  billions coming from that you're going to do this. Are you going to tank

1327
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:18,000
Speaker 5:  Tesla stock and sell a bunch to do this? Because like all he's done and said,

1328
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,960
Speaker 5:  okay, instead of tanking, Tesla stock, by selling off 40

1329
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,740
Speaker 5:  something billion dollars of stock, I'm not going to just do 21 billion.

1330
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,290
Speaker 5:  Like he hasn't changed.

1331
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:32,340
Speaker 1:  No, but I think that, have you ever tweeted about Tesla and your life?

1332
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:37,020
Speaker 1:  There'll be fine. It'll just keep, keep buying the stock. Be like, oh, the

1333
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,760
Speaker 1:  stocks were sale. We got to support Elan.

1334
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:45,120
Speaker 1:  He doesn't exist in like the normal market dynamics.

1335
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:49,560
Speaker 1:  I think, I think he's counting on that. I just think the Twitter board

1336
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,280
Speaker 1:  appears to be somewhat at odds with itself, notably

1337
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,910
Speaker 1:  checked or see just like liking and replying to tweets that Twitter shouldn't

1338
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:57,630
Speaker 1:  be both. Like,

1339
01:11:59,370 --> 01:11:59,790
Speaker 1:  this is very,

1340
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:03,990
Speaker 2:  And like on lighting the board on fire, every chance he gets.

1341
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,350
Speaker 1:  Yeah. He's like the board has always been the problem. So we'll see, like

1342
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:10,710
Speaker 1:  I said, like David said, the core question here is what's going on?

1343
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,960
Speaker 1:  This has happened. So it's still happening. You say we are going to bring

1344
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,350
Speaker 1:  back our newsletter this week in Elan written by Liz Lopatto.

1345
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,310
Speaker 2:  I have a story from Liz on what is going on here, waiting for me to edit

1346
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:27,060
Speaker 2:  when we're done for each casting here. So by the time people hear it, Liz

1347
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,190
Speaker 2:  will have some good thoughts on the site. Cause the other thing that's going

1348
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:33,060
Speaker 2:  on is there are, as you guys have talked about on the show, there are

1349
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:36,420
Speaker 2:  in theory and increasingly in reality, other people who might be interested

1350
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:40,320
Speaker 2:  in buying Twitter, who have very different ideas about what they

1351
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,260
Speaker 2:  could do with Twitter, like Elan just wants to buy it. Cause like he thinks

1352
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:46,860
Speaker 2:  it's hilarious and something, something free speech, but there are others

1353
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:50,160
Speaker 2:  who are going to make like a much more real case that there's a lot of money

1354
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:54,060
Speaker 2:  to be made from Twitter that is not currently making. So like it's all

1355
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,180
Speaker 2:  these different parties bidding against each other for something that they

1356
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:00,780
Speaker 2:  don't want for the same reasons. Like this is going to get messier before

1357
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,790
Speaker 2:  it shakes out. I think one way or another

1358
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:06,720
Speaker 1:  What's fascinating about all this is that Twitter itself rarely makes a case

1359
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,470
Speaker 1:  where its own existence. And they've got a new CEO who's been tasked explicitly

1360
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:13,590
Speaker 1:  with a growing it by a hundred million people. And we just came off the whole

1361
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,900
Speaker 1:  streaming conversation. Like that's a hard hundred million people.

1362
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:18,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah. They're not all just password chairs.

1363
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:24,450
Speaker 1:  It would just be nice to Twitter, started making a positive case for what

1364
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:27,810
Speaker 1:  it might do to grow as opposed to what it's doing now, which is like,

1365
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:31,560
Speaker 1:  like a deer in headlights kind of situation. We'll see

1366
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:35,850
Speaker 1:  other last few things where you gotta get outta here at Delta confirmed exploratory

1367
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:38,760
Speaker 1:  Starling tests, which is really fascinating because they already getting

1368
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,730
Speaker 1:  satellite internet from VSA, which actually quite fast now.

1369
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,620
Speaker 1:  And Starlink is not compared to that. Well, you can just like, you can

1370
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:50,520
Speaker 1:  stream movies on via sat,

1371
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:50,700
Speaker 1:  but

1372
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,050
Speaker 5:  They're going to get the Elan bump.

1373
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:56,130
Speaker 1:  You have Dion bug, but Starlink is like about a hundred down. They

1374
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:59,280
Speaker 1:  have a faster tier now, which is make me 500 down, but you got to support

1375
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:01,380
Speaker 1:  whole plane with that. So I'm just curious how that's gonna work

1376
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:05,150
Speaker 5:  Also at speed, like Starlink is like scared of trees

1377
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:07,710
Speaker 5:  sometimes. It's like, how is it going to handle

1378
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:10,230
Speaker 1:  No tree, no trees in the sky.

1379
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:19,510
Speaker 1:  So let's say they've started the test. I think it's fascinating of all the

1380
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:22,480
Speaker 1:  places started and could compete. It's like go, go in via sat, like yeah,

1381
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:23,110
Speaker 1:  go get 'em.

1382
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,800
Speaker 2:  Well, I would also think if I'm, if I'm one of the airlines, like I'm going

1383
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,550
Speaker 2:  to be so excited to, you know, have, have talks, quote

1384
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:34,180
Speaker 2:  unquote with anyone who could maybe drive the price down for some of these

1385
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:37,570
Speaker 2:  other companies, like they're going to be so amped about

1386
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:41,500
Speaker 2:  competition in this space where there has historically been like less than

1387
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:41,830
Speaker 2:  none.

1388
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:45,220
Speaker 1:  Well, so there are two companies there's go-go and VSI. They bought each

1389
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,780
Speaker 1:  What happens in America. David, when there's two companies, we'd like to

1390
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:53,260
Speaker 1:  get them down to one. That's really how we like these easy

1391
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:56,650
Speaker 1:  Tesla earnings. They earned over 3 billion in profit. Even with its various

1392
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:59,620
Speaker 1:  challenges with supply chain in China, all this stuff. So, you know, it's

1393
01:14:59,620 --> 01:14:59,920
Speaker 1:  doing

1394
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,540
Speaker 2:  Fine. It's only 18 billion left.

1395
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:04,900
Speaker 1:  I just got there. Net neutrality, actually the law in California. Now it

1396
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,070
Speaker 1:  went to court. The court said, Nope, you can have a lot. This was actually

1397
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:11,770
Speaker 1:  very funny. Just like legal procedure stuff. The FCC under Ajit

1398
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:15,640
Speaker 1:  PI Donald Trump, they said Netta child is no longer the law. And

1399
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:19,540
Speaker 1:  also we don't think the sec should add any authority to

1400
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:22,780
Speaker 1:  pass these laws ever. So we no longer have the authority to do net neutrality

1401
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:26,770
Speaker 1:  or not. We solved it. And then the states said,

1402
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:30,730
Speaker 1:  well, we have net neutrality now. Then the carrier said, no,

1403
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:34,480
Speaker 1:  that's traditionally authority left to the FCC. And all they had to say

1404
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,470
Speaker 1:  was no, the FCC. They said they don't want it anymore. And that's how they

1405
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:39,850
Speaker 1:  want it. This is true.

1406
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,890
Speaker 2:  This is the Spiderman meme where

1407
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,570
Speaker 1:  1000% too clever by half. Like, they're like, no, if you just hadn't

1408
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:48,940
Speaker 1:  done this other part, you would have actually been able to preempt this.

1409
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:52,690
Speaker 1:  But you did the other part cause you were greedy. And so now California net

1410
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:56,470
Speaker 1:  neutrality is a lot of California. They could appeal to the Supreme court

1411
01:15:56,470 --> 01:16:00,430
Speaker 1:  who knows if they will. But the fact that it's a law in California, New York

1412
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:03,730
Speaker 1:  state, there's always that meme of like nothing bad happened when a neutrality

1413
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:07,360
Speaker 1:  went away except for the two states where it still exists and all the companies

1414
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,690
Speaker 1:  have to deal with it. Yeah. That's my personal thing. All right. That's it.

1415
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,120
Speaker 1:  We have all these things about amp, but I want to talk about amp.

1416
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:18,310
Speaker 1:  I just want to talk about amp. I've done. I've done enough today. I will

1417
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:21,670
Speaker 1:  tell you that Instagram is begging you to stop re

1418
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:25,960
Speaker 1:  posting to talks, to reels, which is a very good first

1419
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,250
Speaker 1:  David Pierce headline on our website.

1420
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:31,000
Speaker 2:  Thank you. I try Adam. Moseri he's just, he just wants you to make things.

1421
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,260
Speaker 2:  It's all he wants in the whole world,

1422
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:33,700
Speaker 1:  But only for him, make them

1423
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,070
Speaker 2:  For him. Send them to him directly.

1424
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:39,640
Speaker 1:  Some things to call out. We did the decoder episode on young from Fox on.

1425
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:43,540
Speaker 1:  I will tell you this. I've never gotten so many emails from a podcast

1426
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:47,200
Speaker 1:  episode in my life and John Sanford, Josh Rosa, the number of people in

1427
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:51,040
Speaker 1:  Wisconsin who still want to talk about that project. And they are just

1428
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,490
Speaker 1:  emailing us, being like, thank you for pointing out that this is still nuts,

1429
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,310
Speaker 1:  but go listen to that. Decoder

1430
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,120
Speaker 2:  It's get upset.

1431
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,290
Speaker 1:  The AI AK 5g conversation, truly just

1432
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:06,280
Speaker 1:  bonkers. No idea what that means. Still don't know why he reached out.
