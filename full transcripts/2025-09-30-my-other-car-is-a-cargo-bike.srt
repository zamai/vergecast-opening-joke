Description: Sure, you could drive to the grocery store and to school. But wouldn’t you rather grab a few hundred of your friends and bike-bus everywhere? The Verge’s Andy Hawkins joins the show to tell us all about his adventures with electric cargo bikes, and why he thinks they’re the ride of the future. After that, Lauren Feiner calls in from just outside a courthouse in Virginia, where she’s watching the remedies trial in Google’s adtech monopoly case. Google already lost the case; what happens next is still anyone’s guess. Finally, David answers a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about how to feel about summarizing YouTube videos with AI. The short version: you should feel a lot of things.




2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,165
Speaker 1:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of bike buses, which are,

3
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:07,925
Speaker 1:  it turns out exactly what you think they are. I'm your friend David Pierce,

4
00:00:08,145 --> 00:00:11,605
Speaker 1:  And I am sitting here doing a thing I never thought I would be doing, which

5
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:15,245
Speaker 1:  is updating and using the rabbit R one. This is

6
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:18,645
Speaker 1:  the truly terrible AI gadget that

7
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:23,445
Speaker 1:  somehow is still an ongoing concern. It's been like a year and a

8
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:26,885
Speaker 1:  half now, and they just put out a sort of fascinating

9
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:30,805
Speaker 1:  new software update for the thing that completely changes the interface.

10
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:34,565
Speaker 1:  It's all touch now. It has some new ideas about how to do like little apps

11
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:38,085
Speaker 1:  that you can make with prompts. The thing is still bad and you shouldn't

12
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:41,045
Speaker 1:  buy one. To be clear, I have one that is like unopened in a drawer over here

13
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:44,605
Speaker 1:  because I think someday it'll be like a museum piece of weird ai.

14
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,885
Speaker 1:  But I, we're still in this phase where I don't think anybody knows anything

15
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:51,805
Speaker 1:  about how AI gadgets are supposed to work, or even if they're going to be

16
00:00:51,805 --> 00:00:55,645
Speaker 1:  a thing, And I confess as, as bad as this thing is, I, I

17
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:59,485
Speaker 1:  genuinely admire the hustle. But anyway, we are not here to talk about this

18
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:03,445
Speaker 1:  delightful little orange thing. We're gonna do two things On today's Vergecast.

19
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:07,205
Speaker 1:  First, we're gonna talk to Andy Hawkins about his experience with

20
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:11,565
Speaker 1:  electric cargo bikes and basically what it means to take your

21
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:15,805
Speaker 1:  car drives and turn them into bike rides. He is,

22
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:19,205
Speaker 1:  you will learn very passionate about this. We're gonna have some fun After

23
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:22,245
Speaker 1:  that. I'm gonna talk to Lauren Finer about what's going on in the Google

24
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:26,765
Speaker 1:  Ad Tech remedies trial. Google was declared a monopoly in ad

25
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:30,205
Speaker 1:  tech and now has to fight to see what's gonna happen next.

26
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:32,845
Speaker 1:  She's been in court all week. We're gonna talk about it. I'm very excited.

27
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:36,085
Speaker 1:  We also have a fun question from The Vergecast hotline. Lots of good stuff

28
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:39,975
Speaker 1:  to get to, but first I'm gonna make some apps on this

29
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,735
Speaker 1:  thing and tell you if it's any good. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right

30
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:42,935
Speaker 1:  back.

31
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:32,365
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Andy Hawkins is here. Hi, Andy. I'm

32
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:32,925
Speaker 7:  Here. Hello.

33
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:36,605
Speaker 1:  Andy. I have brought you here for a selfish reason. I, I just feel obligated

34
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:40,085
Speaker 1:  to tell you this right up front. Every once in a while, I bring a person

35
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:43,845
Speaker 1:  onto The Vergecast to solve a specific problem for me, specifically.

36
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:47,965
Speaker 1:  Okay. This problem that I'm having is that I cannot convince

37
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:51,805
Speaker 1:  my wife to allow me to buy a very expensive e-bike and use it

38
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:56,165
Speaker 1:  to carry my children and my stuff everywhere all of

39
00:03:56,165 --> 00:04:00,085
Speaker 1:  the time. You have successfully done this in your life. Yes. And

40
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:01,845
Speaker 1:  I have brought you here to teach me your ways.

41
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,845
Speaker 7:  Well, I think maybe the first, the first problem that I'm detecting here

42
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,325
Speaker 7:  is that you are looking for your wife's approval. I, I never sought that.

43
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:13,445
Speaker 7:  I, I just ran rough shot over my wife's feelings

44
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:15,765
Speaker 7:  and her aspirations. No forgiveness,

45
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:17,965
Speaker 1:  Not permission. I love, I love this for you. Yes. Yeah.

46
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:22,605
Speaker 7:  No, no, it, this is a problem that I, I hear a lot from

47
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:26,125
Speaker 7:  my friend group, my social circle, my neighbors.

48
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:29,325
Speaker 7:  It's, it's something that a lot of people have come to me with. It's, which

49
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:32,965
Speaker 7:  is that like, I wanna get a cargo bike, but I don't know if it

50
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:36,805
Speaker 7:  will act like can afford it, if it's gonna fit in with my lifestyle.

51
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:41,325
Speaker 7:  You know, drivers are crazy in my town, you know, they're

52
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:45,125
Speaker 7:  expensive. Where do I put it? There's, people seem to have like lots of

53
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:49,405
Speaker 7:  concerns about this purchase in their life, which is so fascinating

54
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:53,325
Speaker 7:  to me because you, you people will just get up and buy a

55
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:56,605
Speaker 7:  car, buy two cars Yeah. Without any hesitation, right? They'll, they'll just

56
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:59,925
Speaker 7:  be like, oh, I love Subaru. I'm just gonna get another Subaru. And I'll have

57
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,845
Speaker 7:  two Subarus. Because I think it's sort of a reflection of the world

58
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,725
Speaker 7:  that we live in, right? That we live in a world that is sort of built for

59
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:11,845
Speaker 7:  cars and for car drivers and for driving as sort of the primary

60
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:15,485
Speaker 7:  mode of transportation. And it's not built for, for e-bikes. And we're, and

61
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:19,325
Speaker 7:  we're looking for ways in which to kind of like shoehorn an e-bike into our

62
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:22,125
Speaker 7:  lives. Totally. And we have some concerns about that. So, yes. I'm just,

63
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,565
Speaker 7:  just, just to say that I hear this a lot from people. This

64
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,765
Speaker 1:  Actually makes me feel a lot better, I have to say. But, so you, you just

65
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:31,565
Speaker 1:  did a big story for The Verge about your adventures as a, as a cargo bike

66
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:35,525
Speaker 1:  guy. But I'm, I'm curious, sort of rewind a little bit for me. Like, you're

67
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:38,045
Speaker 1:  a, you're a car guy, like professionally,

68
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:42,805
Speaker 1:  you, you car for a living in, in some ways.

69
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:46,965
Speaker 1:  How did you become a bike guy? When, when did this start for you? I, I,

70
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:50,885
Speaker 7:  I've always been a bike guy and I've only just recently kind of like

71
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:54,805
Speaker 7:  been forced to become a car guy as the transportation editor. Okay. But the

72
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:57,325
Speaker 7:  bike guy is my, my default setting that's been been I

73
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:57,685
Speaker 1:  See, okay.

74
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:01,605
Speaker 7:  The way I've lived my life for, for a long time. I grew up in the suburbs,

75
00:06:01,705 --> 00:06:05,285
Speaker 7:  you know, in the Midwest, riding my bike everywhere with my friends. And

76
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,165
Speaker 7:  it does feel like in some ways that, like we did have a little bit more free

77
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:12,645
Speaker 7:  range as kids growing up in the eighties and nineties to bike around

78
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:16,885
Speaker 7:  that kids these days don't seem to have, which we can

79
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:20,325
Speaker 7:  touch on. But yeah, I always been a bike guy, grew up biking in,

80
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:25,005
Speaker 7:  in the, in my, in my suburbs. And then I moved to New York and biked

81
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:28,925
Speaker 7:  all around New York. And now I move, I'm back in the suburbs again and I'm

82
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:32,845
Speaker 7:  like, oh man, I, I have to become a a an SUV guy now. But I,

83
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,805
Speaker 7:  I didn't want that to happen. And fortunately the timing was

84
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:39,845
Speaker 7:  great because cargo bikes have been really sort of on this

85
00:06:40,135 --> 00:06:44,005
Speaker 7:  trajectory of popularity in the us They've been a, a thing in

86
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:47,925
Speaker 7:  Europe and China and elsewhere for a very long time. But I would

87
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:51,745
Speaker 7:  say prior to the pandemic, and then definitely over the course of the

88
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:55,745
Speaker 7:  pandemic, cargo bikes became a lot more popular. And then we're selling at

89
00:06:55,745 --> 00:06:58,545
Speaker 7:  a, at a lot, at a, at a higher rate than they were before.

90
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:01,905
Speaker 1:  Interesting. And what, what makes a cargo bike? A cargo bike? Just to, just

91
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:05,225
Speaker 1:  to quickly define our terms here a little bit. Yes. You're specifically talking

92
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,345
Speaker 1:  about the thing you got is an electric cargo bike, And I think I know what

93
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,665
Speaker 1:  makes a bike electric, what makes a bike cargo.

94
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:14,945
Speaker 7:  So it is the ability to carry cargo, whether or not that is

95
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,785
Speaker 7:  items, grocery items, packages, whatnot, or children,

96
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:20,825
Speaker 7:  potentially even multiple children.

97
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:24,145
Speaker 1:  But we're not talking like little basket on the front. I can put a Trader

98
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:26,145
Speaker 1:  Joe's bag in. That's not that, that's not a cargo,

99
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:29,745
Speaker 7:  No, but there are cargo bikes that do feature a front bucket

100
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:33,865
Speaker 7:  that extends out past the handlebars that are called back

101
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:37,945
Speaker 7:  feets. It's a Dutch term. And that is one, one style, one

102
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:41,745
Speaker 7:  form factor of cargo bikes. Many other ones are, are sort of what,

103
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:45,345
Speaker 7:  what are called long tail cargo bikes. It's sort of an extended rear rack

104
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:49,345
Speaker 7:  on the bike that can support payload, a lot of weight

105
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:53,265
Speaker 7:  depending on the frame and, and whatnot. So yeah, it's just any

106
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:57,105
Speaker 7:  bike that has an electric battery and a motor and that can carry

107
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,825
Speaker 7:  a lot of cargo. And it's, it's been great. It's been great for my life. It's

108
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:03,745
Speaker 7:  been great for a lot of people's lives. It's allowed them to replace car

109
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:07,705
Speaker 7:  trips for errands for, for, you know, taking kids to,

110
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:11,705
Speaker 7:  you know, to school and to, to activities and, and friend and friend play

111
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:15,225
Speaker 7:  dates and things like that. So it's, it's really been a remarkable thing.

112
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:18,905
Speaker 7:  It's, it's honestly, it's, it's changed my life for the better. I am the

113
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:22,625
Speaker 7:  kind of guy who I'm concerned about things like climate change and

114
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:26,665
Speaker 7:  traffic safety because we live in a time in which, you know,

115
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:30,865
Speaker 7:  many more people are being hurt and injured in car accidents and car

116
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:34,625
Speaker 7:  crashes. And I think that one of the solutions to those things is just

117
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,465
Speaker 7:  taking more cars off the road and replacing them with more sustainable modes

118
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:42,225
Speaker 7:  of transportation. And the cargo bike is a, is a, is a great way to do that.

119
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:46,745
Speaker 1:  So why do you think cargo bikes have had such a huge rise in

120
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:49,825
Speaker 1:  the last few years? I mean, I think part of the reason I'm fascinated by

121
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:53,585
Speaker 1:  this space is I've been covering various versions of these like

122
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:57,205
Speaker 1:  last mile vehicles for forever, right? And I think for all the reasons you

123
00:08:57,205 --> 00:09:00,965
Speaker 1:  just laid out the idea of I have somewhere to go that is

124
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:04,805
Speaker 1:  close by, that actually doesn't require my car, but literally

125
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:08,485
Speaker 1:  the only way I have to get there is my car is a, is a bad situation that

126
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:11,685
Speaker 1:  we have found ourselves in, in a sort of unique way, especially in the us.

127
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:15,125
Speaker 1:  And so I'm, I'm all four ways to solve that.

128
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:19,685
Speaker 1:  And you know, I've covered the weird like hoverboards

129
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:23,245
Speaker 1:  and the one wheels and the scooters. I got really into scooters for a really

130
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:26,205
Speaker 1:  long time. Yeah. And I will, I will go to that for scooters for forever.

131
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:30,165
Speaker 1:  But there's something about the cargo bike in

132
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:34,045
Speaker 1:  particular that feels like an answer to the question in,

133
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:36,445
Speaker 1:  in a different way. Like, why do you think that's the thing that really caught

134
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:36,965
Speaker 1:  on for people?

135
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:40,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think it's a couple of sort of trend lines that are intersecting.

136
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:44,325
Speaker 7:  I think one of which is, you know, sort of the technology, right?

137
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:47,645
Speaker 7:  E-bike technology has improved. We've now are seeing,

138
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:52,485
Speaker 7:  you know, lithium ion batteries being developed that can power vehicles

139
00:09:52,545 --> 00:09:55,445
Speaker 7:  for, you know, these, these, these e-bikes for, you know,

140
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:59,205
Speaker 7:  20, 30, 40, 50 miles of range. They're powerful.

141
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:02,285
Speaker 7:  You can get up to, you know, 20, 25 miles per hour.

142
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:07,445
Speaker 7:  And I, you know, I think as we saw sort of an influx of imports

143
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:11,165
Speaker 7:  from, from China mainly of e-bikes and people

144
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:14,445
Speaker 7:  realizing that this is something that they could, you know, start to use

145
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:17,005
Speaker 7:  as a way that, you know, it's not like a traditional bike. You don't end

146
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:20,525
Speaker 7:  up sweaty and bedraggled at the end of your ride because it, you know, sort

147
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:23,645
Speaker 7:  of takes a lot of that effort out of it. And yeah, I think a lot of, you

148
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:26,085
Speaker 7:  know, sort of people in the cycling community would see that it's cheating.

149
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:30,365
Speaker 7:  But, you know, my argument, my rebuttal to that is that, you know, transportation

150
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:34,245
Speaker 7:  doesn't need to be exercise, nor should it be exercise. You know, it's,

151
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:37,365
Speaker 7:  it's really just about getting from point A to point B in the, in the car,

152
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:41,085
Speaker 7:  in the e-bike. And especially the cargo bike is a great way to do that. It's

153
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:44,445
Speaker 7:  the utility of it, right? That it's, you know, it's sort of in this form

154
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:48,365
Speaker 7:  factor, but also you can take up, you could sort of throw on a lot of stuff.

155
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:52,125
Speaker 7:  You know, it's, it's more than just the passenger. When you can add passengers,

156
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:55,645
Speaker 7:  you can add cargo, you could add, you know, sort of all the things that you

157
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:58,725
Speaker 7:  need to carry that you would need to as part of, you know, the errands that

158
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:02,005
Speaker 7:  you're running. So the utility of it has been I think, a real positive aspect

159
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:05,085
Speaker 7:  of it. And then I think also the pandemic had a lot to do with it as well.

160
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:08,525
Speaker 7:  You know, we were all cooped up in our houses. We were looking for ways to

161
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:12,485
Speaker 7:  get out, socially distanced ways to get out of our houses. And e-bikes were

162
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:16,285
Speaker 7:  a great way to do that. So a lot of the sales were peaking

163
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:19,445
Speaker 7:  during the pandemic. They flatlined a little bit, but then they've sort of

164
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,405
Speaker 7:  since recovered in, in, in sales are backup to sort of

165
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:27,045
Speaker 7:  that pandemic level. So I think it's been a, a bunch of different things

166
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:30,965
Speaker 7:  there that have sort of led to this, this growing popularity of

167
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,205
Speaker 7:  electric cargo bikes.

168
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,045
Speaker 1:  I so envy people who picked up like active outdoor activities during the

169
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:40,085
Speaker 1:  pandemic. Like I just, I really earnestly admire all of those people. I

170
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:43,885
Speaker 1:  got like way too into one very specific

171
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:48,005
Speaker 1:  version of the FIFA video game. That's what I did during the pandemic. And

172
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:51,005
Speaker 1:  I learned how to juggle, like those are the, those were my pandemic hobbies.

173
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:51,325
Speaker 1:  It was,

174
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:54,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Or the sourdough people, right? Like are they, do they still have their

175
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:55,125
Speaker 7:  sourdough?

176
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,605
Speaker 1:  What's going on with that? If I had put that into biking, everything would've

177
00:11:57,605 --> 00:12:01,485
Speaker 1:  been better. So I'm curious for sort of your own experience. 'cause I

178
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:05,125
Speaker 1:  think I want to touch on a lot of what you said about the kind of like macro

179
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:09,045
Speaker 1:  way in which these fit into the world. But you've had this thing for a while.

180
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:12,485
Speaker 1:  You've been using it for a while. Like what, what's actually on the list

181
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:16,245
Speaker 1:  of like, things that a cargo bike has solved for you day to day?

182
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:20,365
Speaker 7:  It's really just been like an incredible, you know, thing in my life.

183
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,685
Speaker 7:  You know, we've, we're a one car household, which in the suburbs is really

184
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:27,645
Speaker 7:  hard to do. But having that cargo bike as a way to sort

185
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:31,605
Speaker 7:  of allow us to make those trips when my wife has the car or I

186
00:12:31,605 --> 00:12:35,085
Speaker 7:  have the car, she's able to, to take the bike out or I'm able to take the

187
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:38,405
Speaker 7:  bike out and go pick up the kids or go to the grocery store or what have

188
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:41,885
Speaker 7:  you. And it's a way of sort of, you know, reducing our own carbon

189
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:45,445
Speaker 7:  footprint to some degree, which is, you know, I think pretty great.

190
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:49,725
Speaker 7:  I think it's, everyone's looking for ways in which to I think

191
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:53,405
Speaker 7:  drive less and to, you know, sort of be more climate

192
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,525
Speaker 7:  focused. And, and this has been our way of doing that.

193
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:59,845
Speaker 1:  How long did it take to redo your routines? Like, I,

194
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:03,405
Speaker 1:  I think about a while ago I bought, I bought a scooter And I was like, I'm,

195
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:07,205
Speaker 1:  I'm gonna be a person who just like takes a scooter to all of

196
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,805
Speaker 1:  the things. 'cause most of the things I need are too close to drive. Like,

197
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:13,325
Speaker 1:  it's gonna be great. And then I would forget, I would, I would find myself

198
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:16,325
Speaker 1:  in the car halfway to the grocery store and I'd be like, oh crap, I was supposed

199
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:20,285
Speaker 1:  to take the scooter. And there, I think I, the thing that I came away

200
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:22,725
Speaker 1:  from that experience with was just realizing how

201
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:27,725
Speaker 1:  car-centric everything is, like including our lives. And

202
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,085
Speaker 1:  like, did you, did you have to spend months sort of deliberately being like,

203
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:34,765
Speaker 1:  I am going to do this on the cargo bike before it felt like a natural part

204
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:35,445
Speaker 1:  of your routine?

205
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I, I think that's, that's a really great question because it, it did

206
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:43,125
Speaker 7:  take I think a little bit of a psychological shift, right? That there was

207
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,965
Speaker 7:  a lot of stuff that we would probably just naturally have taken the car

208
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:50,165
Speaker 7:  out to do that I had to be like, okay, no, let's, let's take the cargo bike.

209
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:53,805
Speaker 7:  You know, let's sort of like try to figure a way to like repack the things

210
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:57,605
Speaker 7:  that we were gonna take with us if we were going to the town pool or we were

211
00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:01,325
Speaker 7:  going to a playground or, you know, we were going to some sort of, you know,

212
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:05,765
Speaker 7:  afterschool activity or whatnot. It definitely took a little bit more, you

213
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:09,405
Speaker 7:  know, like it's, it's gonna get dark soon, right? We have to make sure we

214
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:12,925
Speaker 7:  have our lights and our reflector vests and all these other things to make

215
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:16,205
Speaker 7:  sure that cars can see us when we're out of the road. And I do think a lot

216
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:20,085
Speaker 7:  of that adjustment has to do with, you know, making sure that you feel safe

217
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:23,965
Speaker 7:  while doing that. Because so many people have have told me, you know, since

218
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:27,205
Speaker 7:  this video has come out and also just, you know, over, over the years of

219
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:31,405
Speaker 7:  covering this, this industry that they would love to adopt a cargo

220
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:35,125
Speaker 7:  bike, but they just personally don't feel safe enough doing it because that

221
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,885
Speaker 7:  where they live is just not, you know, not bike friendly, that the

222
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:42,765
Speaker 7:  drivers are particularly crazy. There's just not enough infrastructure around

223
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:46,525
Speaker 7:  to support that kind of lifestyle. And to that I say I, I

224
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:50,285
Speaker 7:  totally feel that And I understand where those people are coming from because

225
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:54,205
Speaker 7:  yes, broadly across the United States, it's, it's not really safe to,

226
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:58,525
Speaker 7:  to have a cargo bike or to bike in general as

227
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:01,685
Speaker 7:  part of your normal day-to-day lifestyle. And so

228
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:06,325
Speaker 7:  I would say that, you know, I found like a group of people in

229
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:10,245
Speaker 7:  my town in particular that were also very interested in biking. We

230
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:13,725
Speaker 7:  started a bike bus and that sort of created a community around cycling,

231
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:17,645
Speaker 7:  especially with kids to school every, every Friday. But

232
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:20,965
Speaker 7:  no, yeah, it's like you, you, you ride in a, in a big group, right? And the

233
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:23,645
Speaker 7:  sort of the idea being that there's safety in numbers, right? Because it

234
00:15:23,645 --> 00:15:27,565
Speaker 7:  is kind of daunting when you're, you know, we've got little kindergartners

235
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:31,685
Speaker 7:  on their, on their bikes riding, you know, in the street

236
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:35,805
Speaker 7:  alongside of huge trucks and SUVs and buses and all of this

237
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:38,685
Speaker 7:  kind of stuff. But we're, you know, we're biking with them, you know, it's

238
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:42,045
Speaker 7:  a big group. We're all biking together, the kids are laughing and talking

239
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:45,645
Speaker 7:  amongst themselves. We were inspired by a man named Sam

240
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:49,165
Speaker 7:  Balto, who's since become a, a, a friend of mine who is a,

241
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:53,365
Speaker 7:  a, a PE teacher out in Portland, Oregon. And so he had a cargo bike. He

242
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:56,805
Speaker 7:  was taking his, his kids to school and decided, hey, what if other people

243
00:15:56,835 --> 00:16:00,325
Speaker 7:  want a bike as well? And just started doing it on a weekly basis,

244
00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:03,925
Speaker 7:  playing lots of fun music on the ride. They'll sometimes have,

245
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:07,965
Speaker 7:  you know, special guests come along. And

246
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:12,085
Speaker 7:  it really grew into like this incredible thing where he was having like hundreds

247
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:15,365
Speaker 7:  of kids ride ride with him. Oh wow. So we're like, oh, we could do that in

248
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:19,165
Speaker 7:  our town as well. So we started with just like five parents and their kids

249
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:23,325
Speaker 7:  biking to school. And now, you know, it's been three years of doing this

250
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:27,365
Speaker 7:  every Friday throughout the school year we have, you know, upwards

251
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:31,045
Speaker 7:  of 400 kids that ride to all seven schools in our town.

252
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:34,925
Speaker 7:  We have multiple routes, we have an interactive map on our

253
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:38,725
Speaker 7:  website and all this stuff. And it really is just sort of brought the town

254
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:41,765
Speaker 7:  together in a way that has been, I think, really positive. And you can just

255
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:45,645
Speaker 7:  see it in the kids' faces when they get to ride to school. You know,

256
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:49,405
Speaker 7:  we're blasting K-pop demon hunters and chapel Rowan and all the things that

257
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:53,165
Speaker 7:  they love. And I, it's just like they get a little physical

258
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:57,285
Speaker 7:  activity and they also get to experience the world outside of a car, right?

259
00:16:57,285 --> 00:17:00,525
Speaker 7:  Because like so much of this is about, you know, long car lines

260
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:05,005
Speaker 7:  in some communities to drop it off and pick up kids. It's just such a a,

261
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:08,605
Speaker 7:  a depressing thing I think for so many parents. What's a way that we can

262
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:12,085
Speaker 7:  sort of make this a little bit more joyful and a little bit more, you know,

263
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:16,045
Speaker 7:  beneficial for, for, you know, community building? 'cause especially in

264
00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:19,925
Speaker 7:  kids feel so isolated and lonely these days, and it's a

265
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,445
Speaker 7:  way of sort of bringing them together. And I do think honestly and truly

266
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:27,605
Speaker 7:  that the cargo bike was really an important factor in helping us sort

267
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:30,245
Speaker 7:  of build this, this thing that we did. That's

268
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:34,045
Speaker 1:  Really cool. I do think that interaction with like the rest of the road

269
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:37,445
Speaker 1:  is, is a big piece of the puzzle here. And, and you've touched on this a

270
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:41,245
Speaker 1:  little bit, but it seems to me that like what you're

271
00:17:41,245 --> 00:17:45,165
Speaker 1:  describing is, is very familiar sounding to anyone who has like,

272
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,965
Speaker 1:  lived in sort of a, a bike centric city in Europe where like, everybody

273
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,685
Speaker 1:  bikes everywhere. Or like, I I think about the, the

274
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:57,125
Speaker 1:  countries in Asia where the, those like Vespa style scooters are absolutely

275
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,925
Speaker 1:  everywhere. And it's just the, this stuff is just much more sort of

276
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:04,885
Speaker 1:  intermingled and interactive. And in the US it is just cars. It's,

277
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:08,845
Speaker 1:  it's just cars. And so I think one of the

278
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:11,285
Speaker 1:  questions, and this is the thing I, I talked spent a lot of time thinking

279
00:18:11,285 --> 00:18:15,005
Speaker 1:  about in talking to people about, with scooters in particular is like, yes,

280
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:18,765
Speaker 1:  there is a technology product problem here, but there's

281
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,605
Speaker 1:  also like a human social problem. Like, where do I write

282
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:26,565
Speaker 1:  this thing? Where do I put it? What's the right if I I'm, am

283
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:29,565
Speaker 1:  I supposed to be in the bike lane and are the people in the bike lane not

284
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:32,645
Speaker 1:  riding e-bikes allowed to be pissed at me for it? Or am I supposed to be

285
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,245
Speaker 1:  in the road and pissing off all the people who are in cars that wanna go

286
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:39,125
Speaker 1:  faster? Like I, I guess the problem with this is

287
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,925
Speaker 1:  there's no way to solve the problem without causing a problem. Yeah.

288
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:47,085
Speaker 1:  But I, I do wonder, like, do you think we're making any kind of

289
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:50,685
Speaker 1:  progress figuring out how all of these different things are supposed to interact

290
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:51,125
Speaker 1:  with each other?

291
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:56,645
Speaker 7:  So it's been a really interesting phenomena because I do think that

292
00:18:57,145 --> 00:19:00,005
Speaker 7:  one of, one of the aspects that's been really fascinating to watch with sort

293
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,885
Speaker 7:  of the, the rise in popularity of e-bikes is all of the tensions

294
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:07,805
Speaker 7:  that has, has resulted in that, right? Yeah. So for the longest time,

295
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:11,445
Speaker 7:  you know, the cities that did have bike lanes, they were the exclusive realm

296
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:15,165
Speaker 7:  of, you know, normal cyclists, right? The either the people who did it

297
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:18,085
Speaker 7:  recreationally or the people who did it for transportation. And then you

298
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:22,045
Speaker 7:  had sort of the, the rise of the delivery workers using e-bikes and

299
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:25,845
Speaker 7:  places like New York and even in the suburbs, like my suburb out here in

300
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:29,765
Speaker 7:  New Jersey, we have a lot of guys riding e-bikes, riding electric mopeds,

301
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:33,645
Speaker 7:  delivering food, and then became, you know, sort of like

302
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:37,325
Speaker 7:  the, the rise of the, you know, sort of the, I would call it the

303
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:40,765
Speaker 7:  e-bike teen. And the e-bike teen has, has,

304
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:44,045
Speaker 7:  has led to a lot of very

305
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:49,205
Speaker 7:  panicked Facebook posts, I would say across the country

306
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:53,285
Speaker 7:  as well as some, you know, some very like, you know,

307
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:57,325
Speaker 7:  desperate conversations on places like Nextdoor and other places like that

308
00:19:57,455 --> 00:20:01,365
Speaker 7:  where everyone is now up in arms over these teenagers

309
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:05,165
Speaker 7:  riding very high powered electric

310
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:08,245
Speaker 7:  mopeds and sometimes even motorcycles in some cases.

311
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:13,845
Speaker 7:  And, And I do think that it, it has raised a lot of people's,

312
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:18,245
Speaker 7:  you know, concerns over safety. You know, you've, and

313
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:22,605
Speaker 7:  to which I would say it's good that kids are riding bikes, it's good

314
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:26,045
Speaker 7:  that they're riding e-bikes. They should be safe while doing it. They should

315
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:29,245
Speaker 7:  wear helmets and they should follow the, the, the rules of the road. But

316
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:31,565
Speaker 1:  What are the rules of the road? Like I, I don't know that it's as simple

317
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,645
Speaker 1:  as you just said it, right? Like, I was out the other day and there were

318
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:37,605
Speaker 1:  these two kids riding, I mean, they couldn't have been more than 12. Yeah.

319
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:40,125
Speaker 1:  And if you had just shown me the things that they were riding, I would've

320
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,685
Speaker 1:  been like, that's a motorcycle. Yeah. Like, it just, yeah. It just is. And

321
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:46,485
Speaker 1:  so we're at this point now where like, I, I don't know where

322
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,005
Speaker 1:  you're supposed to be. I don't know how fast you're supposed to, I like,

323
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:53,325
Speaker 1:  I don't know whether to yell at this kid who's cutting me off on the street

324
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,485
Speaker 1:  while I'm, you know what I mean? Like Yeah. I think all of this stuff, and

325
00:20:56,485 --> 00:21:00,365
Speaker 1:  especially once you get to these very powerful electric bikes that go, you

326
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:04,325
Speaker 1:  know, in some cases like 25 plus miles an hour, like you could make a pretty

327
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:07,205
Speaker 1:  compelling case that that's a car and should be treated like one

328
00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:08,445
Speaker 7:  Or a motorcycle. Yeah.

329
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:11,645
Speaker 1:  Or a motorcycle, right? And so I think all this, all these things are so

330
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:15,405
Speaker 1:  blurry and it feels like we, until we have some kind of answers, everybody's

331
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:16,085
Speaker 1:  gonna hate everybody.

332
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:20,325
Speaker 7:  I think it really exposes that there's this sort of, this huge gap in our

333
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:24,285
Speaker 7:  regulatory environment right now that if you just throw, you know,

334
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:30,085
Speaker 7:  pedals on something and ca you can, you can legally call it a bike. And it

335
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:33,885
Speaker 7:  doesn't matter if there's 750 watt or a thousand watt motor

336
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:37,365
Speaker 7:  underneath the thing. Sure. And that the, that the person using it will actually

337
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:41,325
Speaker 7:  never a end up actually pedalling that they can just use a throttle. I

338
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:44,005
Speaker 7:  think that there's this, there's a pretty solid argument that that is not

339
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:47,965
Speaker 7:  a bike that is a, a moped or a motorcycle and that it should be, you know,

340
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:52,245
Speaker 7:  you know, the rules that apply to mopeds and motorcycles should also apply

341
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:55,205
Speaker 7:  to, to this, to this vehicle, right? But that's not the case, right? Because

342
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:59,165
Speaker 7:  we, there's this, there's this giant loophole that exists and the

343
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:03,085
Speaker 7:  regulators are not keeping up with it. So, And I do

344
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:06,845
Speaker 7:  think that a, aside from sort of like the consumer safety aspect of it all,

345
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:09,685
Speaker 7:  the infrastructure also is a huge piece that we're lacking

346
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:14,805
Speaker 7:  towns today. There's, you know, it takes years and years and years to get

347
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:18,725
Speaker 7:  anything protected infrastructure wise built in any kind of town because

348
00:22:18,785 --> 00:22:22,645
Speaker 7:  it has to be endlessly debated. There has to be 10,000 community

349
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:26,565
Speaker 7:  meetings, you know, and everyone is so concerned about parking and the

350
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:30,405
Speaker 7:  loss of, you know, space for cars. But fundamentally, we've already given

351
00:22:30,405 --> 00:22:33,525
Speaker 7:  over all of the space that we have to cars. And we're gonna have to take

352
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:36,845
Speaker 7:  some of that back if we're gonna have enough infrastructure to support all

353
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:40,365
Speaker 7:  of these new rider and these new vehicles that are cropping up. So that's

354
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:43,965
Speaker 7:  something that I talked about in the video with some of the e-bike folks

355
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:47,645
Speaker 7:  that I reached out to. And they, they acknowledged that the little space

356
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:51,445
Speaker 7:  that has been allocated to bikes is now pa you know,

357
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:55,325
Speaker 7:  it, it's at capacity. And we need to either figure out how to get

358
00:22:55,355 --> 00:22:59,125
Speaker 7:  more space so that there can be both enough room for the

359
00:22:59,155 --> 00:23:03,085
Speaker 7:  e-bikes and also the analog bikes and for the drivers, because we

360
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:06,965
Speaker 7:  fundamentally just need to get everyone out of each other's way. Right? The

361
00:23:06,965 --> 00:23:10,805
Speaker 7:  cars, the cars want their own way. The bikes want their own way. And

362
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:13,365
Speaker 7:  when they all start mixing and intermingling, that's where

363
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:17,845
Speaker 7:  danger comes from. And, and, and people get injured and people get killed,

364
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:21,925
Speaker 7:  especially children and, and teenagers. So I, I do think

365
00:23:21,955 --> 00:23:25,765
Speaker 7:  that we are not prepared at the moment.

366
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:29,205
Speaker 7:  You're starting to see more towns that are

367
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:32,405
Speaker 7:  committed to making themselves more bikeable. That was some of the, that

368
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:35,765
Speaker 7:  that I, I, I found in the research that more towns

369
00:23:37,035 --> 00:23:41,005
Speaker 7:  have become more bikeable, but there's still a long ways to go. And

370
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:44,725
Speaker 7:  I do have concerns that, you know, sort of like what is safe today

371
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:48,845
Speaker 7:  is is only gonna get worse if we just keep ignoring this problem. Yeah.

372
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:52,205
Speaker 1:  Well one of the reasons I think cargo bikes are specifically interesting

373
00:23:52,205 --> 00:23:56,045
Speaker 1:  on this front is that there's something about doing it

374
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:59,845
Speaker 1:  in a way that is explicitly useful that I think changes the

375
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:02,485
Speaker 1:  conversation in actually really productive way. And so, like in the town

376
00:24:02,565 --> 00:24:03,485
Speaker 1:  I live in, in Virginia

377
00:24:05,155 --> 00:24:08,725
Speaker 1:  last year, 2024, they did a big project to

378
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:13,605
Speaker 1:  expand and essentially block off a bunch of bike lanes, right? They just

379
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:16,845
Speaker 1:  put up those like little white poles to just put a little space between the

380
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:20,805
Speaker 1:  bike lane and the cars and people flipped out and, and it's,

381
00:24:20,805 --> 00:24:23,445
Speaker 1:  and and of course they do, right? Like everybody loses their mind about everything.

382
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,365
Speaker 1:  But, but the one piece of the argument that I thought was so interesting

383
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:30,745
Speaker 1:  on the pro car lobby was essentially, I, I'm in my

384
00:24:30,745 --> 00:24:33,945
Speaker 1:  car because I need to go somewhere and you're gonna make traffic worse for

385
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:37,785
Speaker 1:  me so that some, you know, some loser on a bike

386
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:42,025
Speaker 1:  can, can have their delightful outdoor exercise. And I like, I think to some

387
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:44,665
Speaker 1:  extent that's like disingenuous And I think study after study has proven

388
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:47,105
Speaker 1:  that it doesn't actually increase traffic. So like that is what it is. But

389
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:51,105
Speaker 1:  I think the idea of, of a bike like this, that is,

390
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:53,985
Speaker 1:  it is, it is, I'm gonna the grocery store in my car and you're going to the

391
00:24:53,985 --> 00:24:57,105
Speaker 1:  grocery store on the bike and actually you're not, you're not out for a joy

392
00:24:57,105 --> 00:25:00,665
Speaker 1:  ride. You are out to do something. And the only difference in our goals is

393
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,625
Speaker 1:  the mode of transportation we used to get there. I actually think like resets

394
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:08,585
Speaker 1:  some of that debate in a way that is really productive. And so I

395
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:11,625
Speaker 1:  wonder if the rise in all this is actually gonna make that stuff easier to

396
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:11,985
Speaker 1:  talk about.

397
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:15,625
Speaker 7:  I, I completely agree with you And I, And I can tell you from, from personal

398
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:19,305
Speaker 7:  experience that that's the case. Because I feel like if I was going

399
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:22,945
Speaker 7:  into my town council meetings during the public comment period and talking

400
00:25:22,945 --> 00:25:26,705
Speaker 7:  about we need more public, you know, more bike lanes and more protected infrastructure

401
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:30,425
Speaker 7:  And I was wearing spandex and like racing gear and like

402
00:25:30,455 --> 00:25:31,265
Speaker 1:  Just like, get a job.

403
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:35,265
Speaker 7:  Yeah. They would laugh me out of the room and they'd say, you know, forget

404
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:39,225
Speaker 7:  this guy. But if I, but instead I go in wearing my bike bus vest

405
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:43,065
Speaker 7:  And I'm dressed normally And I have my kids with me and I'm like, Hey,

406
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:46,625
Speaker 7:  here's my kids. We bike to school every Friday. We think it's a great time.

407
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:50,465
Speaker 7:  We wish that we could do this more often, you know, all the time.

408
00:25:50,605 --> 00:25:54,025
Speaker 7:  And it would be great if the, if you would support lower speed limits,

409
00:25:54,445 --> 00:25:58,065
Speaker 7:  you know, livable streets protected infrastructure. And that has had

410
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:02,305
Speaker 7:  a serious impact. It has had an effect. We have

411
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:06,105
Speaker 7:  gotten through, I think, to some of the people who are in charge through,

412
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:09,065
Speaker 7:  through the, through the presentation of our argument. I feel like because

413
00:26:09,085 --> 00:26:12,705
Speaker 7:  we are saying we wanna use this for the utility aspect,

414
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:17,105
Speaker 7:  for the, the, the social aspect because we just wanna get around in

415
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:20,425
Speaker 7:  a way that doesn't contribute to climate change and that's better for everybody

416
00:26:20,565 --> 00:26:24,305
Speaker 7:  around us. And that takes cars off the roads. They, they, they, I think that

417
00:26:24,305 --> 00:26:28,145
Speaker 7:  that that argument, it really has a lot more sway. And so I do think

418
00:26:28,145 --> 00:26:32,055
Speaker 7:  cargo bikes have a way to do that as well because they, you know, that's

419
00:26:32,055 --> 00:26:35,255
Speaker 7:  not something that you're just, you're using out of a, a sense of recreation.

420
00:26:35,395 --> 00:26:38,775
Speaker 7:  You're using it out of a sense of utility, out of a sense of, you know, like

421
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:42,695
Speaker 7:  how can I make my life a little bit better while using cars less? And I do

422
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:46,245
Speaker 7:  think that that's been sort of a real game changer.

423
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:50,405
Speaker 7:  And I feel in sort of a lot of these local conversations that are

424
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:53,765
Speaker 7:  being replicated and going on all over the country right now.

425
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:58,205
Speaker 1:  I do remember one really eye-opening part of my brief

426
00:26:58,205 --> 00:27:00,245
Speaker 1:  schooner opening experience was

427
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:06,445
Speaker 1:  suddenly you, you've like, noticed differently how annoying it is

428
00:27:06,445 --> 00:27:09,405
Speaker 1:  to drive all the time in a way that I think is actually,

429
00:27:10,705 --> 00:27:12,965
Speaker 1:  we just don't notice it 'cause we just do it, right? Yeah. It's just life.

430
00:27:13,105 --> 00:27:16,085
Speaker 1:  And I think when you suddenly are sort of pulled out of the amount of time

431
00:27:16,085 --> 00:27:19,925
Speaker 1:  you spend looking for a parking spot and then looking for your

432
00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:23,765
Speaker 1:  car and sitting in traffic and waiting for red lights and other cars are

433
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:26,925
Speaker 1:  idiots, like just having your eyes open to that a little

434
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:31,885
Speaker 1:  ha made everything else seem more appealing that it's like, oh

435
00:27:32,595 --> 00:27:35,765
Speaker 1:  sure, I'm gonna have to do like a little bit more work to like find the lights

436
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:39,485
Speaker 1:  so that I can get home afterwards. But I get to park my bike right

437
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:43,445
Speaker 1:  out front of the damn grocery store. Yeah. And that is a

438
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:47,085
Speaker 1:  pretty big win. Alright, I need to let you go here in a minute, but first

439
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:50,805
Speaker 1:  you, you've now had a lot of experience with this. So if I'm, if I'm shopping

440
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:54,525
Speaker 1:  for a cargo bike, which I hopefully will be very soon, as soon as Anna hears

441
00:27:54,525 --> 00:27:57,005
Speaker 1:  this and agrees that this is a terrific idea and good for the world,

442
00:27:58,505 --> 00:28:01,685
Speaker 1:  what's, what's the most important thing, like having used one of these for

443
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:03,885
Speaker 1:  now? Like what matters most if you're trying to buy a cargo bike?

444
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:08,085
Speaker 7:  I, I would say maintenance and repairability. Making sure that whichever

445
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:11,965
Speaker 7:  company you're buying from that has some sort of either a relationship with

446
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:15,645
Speaker 7:  a local bike shop and a way that you can get your bike tuned up and

447
00:28:15,645 --> 00:28:18,765
Speaker 7:  repaired. Because you know, the, the thing about e-bikes and especially cargo

448
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:22,045
Speaker 7:  bikes, they get used a lot more than regular bikes. That's sort of like their

449
00:28:22,045 --> 00:28:25,325
Speaker 7:  magic power. Their secret power is that you use them all the time, so they

450
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:28,125
Speaker 7:  wear down a little bit. They're gonna need to get tuned up, make sure that

451
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:31,525
Speaker 7:  your local bike shop is able to do that. And then I would also just say,

452
00:28:31,865 --> 00:28:34,645
Speaker 7:  if you have a little bit of money to spend and you don't mind

453
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,365
Speaker 7:  shooting for something that a little bit topnotch, anything with a Bosch

454
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:42,245
Speaker 7:  motor is pretty incredible. That company has a fantastic

455
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:46,085
Speaker 7:  service reputation. Their, their e-bikes are

456
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:49,845
Speaker 7:  the motors that they, that they build are really far and away a lot better

457
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:53,205
Speaker 7:  than than most others. So those are the things I would say to look for.

458
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:56,125
Speaker 1:  That's good to know. Do you think there's a path towards these things getting

459
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:59,805
Speaker 1:  less expensive? I think I've been waiting for years as

460
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:03,165
Speaker 1:  they've risen and lithium ion technology has gotten great and

461
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:07,645
Speaker 1:  EVs are everywhere. I've been waiting for these things to sort of hit a,

462
00:29:07,765 --> 00:29:11,405
Speaker 1:  a price point that feels plausible and like, I

463
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:14,805
Speaker 1:  know you're gonna say, well, it's cheaper than buying a car. And like, I'm

464
00:29:14,805 --> 00:29:18,405
Speaker 1:  sure that's true. Yes. These are really expensive bikes. Yeah. Like, do you,

465
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:22,045
Speaker 1:  are we, are we, is there a glimmer of hope that it might get

466
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:23,845
Speaker 1:  more affordable over time? So

467
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,685
Speaker 7:  There are definitely a range. You can get bikes that are more budget

468
00:29:27,885 --> 00:29:31,845
Speaker 7:  and affordable that, you know, won't break the bank. You can get

469
00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:35,085
Speaker 7:  a a, a good car, a decent sized cargo bike for, you know, I would say around

470
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:38,965
Speaker 7:  $2,000. You don't have to spend six, $7,000 on the premium model.

471
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:43,365
Speaker 7:  But that said, you know, like I said, make sure there's a an

472
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:47,565
Speaker 7:  adequate customer service and maintenance and repair and and repair system

473
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,645
Speaker 7:  in place. But yeah, I I, I, I do have concerns because

474
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:55,085
Speaker 7:  the vast majority of bikes come from China. I think like over

475
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:58,845
Speaker 7:  95% of bikes are built in, made in China. And I think as

476
00:29:59,085 --> 00:30:03,045
Speaker 7:  long as we have this tariff structure and trade war situation going on,

477
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,765
Speaker 7:  I, I don't see a, a lot of hope for the future. There have been legislatively

478
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:11,965
Speaker 7:  some efforts to kind of try to bring onshore some of that bike

479
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:15,125
Speaker 7:  manufacturing offer some credits and some incentives to people to

480
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:01,285
Speaker 1:  Alright, we're back. Coming to you live from a

481
00:34:01,385 --> 00:34:04,765
Speaker 1:  Panera outside of a courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia,

482
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:09,085
Speaker 1:  where it is time for Google to fight for its life in the ad

483
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:12,245
Speaker 1:  tech world. Lauren Finers here. Hi Lauren. Thanks

484
00:34:12,365 --> 00:34:12,925
Speaker 10:  For having me.

485
00:34:13,145 --> 00:34:16,405
Speaker 1:  So you're on lunch break. Describe us the scene, where are you, what are

486
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:20,005
Speaker 1:  you doing? You're on audio only. Just paint us a word picture of your life

487
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:20,645
Speaker 1:  right this second.

488
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:24,365
Speaker 10:  Yes, I am outside the beautiful Panera in

489
00:34:24,535 --> 00:34:28,245
Speaker 10:  Alexandria, Virginia, which has really great broccoli cheddar

490
00:34:28,515 --> 00:34:29,405
Speaker 10:  soup. That's

491
00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:29,485
Speaker 1:  True.

492
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:34,485
Speaker 10:  And you know, it's, it's pretty nice out here And I can use my phone. So

493
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,445
Speaker 10:  that's something that I can't do inside the courtroom.

494
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:40,765
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So this is, I just wanna say just an incredibly rude

495
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:43,485
Speaker 1:  thing that, that this courthouse is doing to you.

496
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:47,445
Speaker 1:  You And I have both spent a lot of time in courtrooms over the last couple

497
00:34:47,445 --> 00:34:50,565
Speaker 1:  of years. Yes. Covering Google trials. You unfortunately, much more than

498
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:54,405
Speaker 1:  me. But the thing where you can like

499
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:57,405
Speaker 1:  sit in a media room and watch a stream of it while you're on your computer.

500
00:34:57,835 --> 00:35:01,605
Speaker 1:  Nice, lovely. Delightful. Totally manageable. The thing where they like

501
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:04,965
Speaker 1:  scream at you until you turn off all of your devices and you sit and you

502
00:35:04,965 --> 00:35:08,525
Speaker 1:  write with a pen on paper, like a, like our

503
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:11,845
Speaker 1:  ancestors did just cruel and mean And I did not appreciate it.

504
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:16,125
Speaker 10:  Yeah, yeah. It it's pretty archaic, but yeah. Yeah. I'm not a fan,

505
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:20,685
Speaker 1:  But, so the, the trial that you're in right now is the remedies

506
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,645
Speaker 1:  trial for the Google Ad Tech case. And this is not

507
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:28,645
Speaker 1:  the other Google antitrust case, it's the other other Google

508
00:35:28,675 --> 00:35:32,645
Speaker 1:  antitrust case. But just real quick for, for people who have not been

509
00:35:32,645 --> 00:35:35,885
Speaker 1:  following the twist and turns of, of the ad tech thing, kind of catch us

510
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:39,685
Speaker 1:  up to the beginning of this particular trial. Like

511
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:43,565
Speaker 1:  how in the, give us the sort of CliffNotes versions of what this fight has

512
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:43,845
Speaker 1:  been about.

513
00:35:44,155 --> 00:35:48,005
Speaker 10:  Yeah, so I think the Google antitrust trial that most people

514
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:52,445
Speaker 10:  are will remember is the one over search, where recently we got the

515
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:56,125
Speaker 10:  court ruling saying that Google doesn't have to spin out Chrome

516
00:35:56,225 --> 00:36:00,085
Speaker 10:  in order to remedy its search monopoly. That's a separate case.

517
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:04,205
Speaker 10:  This case was filed during the Biden administration

518
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:09,725
Speaker 10:  and is about Google's ad tech monopoly. So basically

519
00:36:10,185 --> 00:36:13,325
Speaker 10:  Google owns a series of tools

520
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:17,805
Speaker 10:  that work in different sides of the ad buying and selling

521
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:20,965
Speaker 10:  market. And the judge has found that Google

522
00:36:21,235 --> 00:36:24,805
Speaker 10:  monopolized two markets with two of its tools

523
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:29,085
Speaker 10:  and also illegally tied together those tools. And why does any of this

524
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:32,365
Speaker 10:  matter? This all sounds really complicated. Basically

525
00:36:32,965 --> 00:36:36,045
Speaker 10:  I think, you know, the thing I often remind myself as I'm sitting there

526
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:39,885
Speaker 10:  listening to all of these really complicated terms and acronyms

527
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:43,605
Speaker 10:  is really what this whole case is about is

528
00:36:44,145 --> 00:36:48,045
Speaker 10:  the revenue stream that funds a lot of journalism and a lot

529
00:36:48,185 --> 00:36:51,925
Speaker 10:  of websites across the internet. So the, the

530
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:55,845
Speaker 10:  portion of advertising we're talking about is what is referred to

531
00:36:55,845 --> 00:36:59,205
Speaker 10:  in the trial as open web display ads, which are

532
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:03,485
Speaker 10:  those ads that appear in kind of like boxes on

533
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:07,165
Speaker 10:  websites you visit, like probably in the middle of a page or on the side

534
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:11,005
Speaker 10:  of a page of like the New York Times for example. Or you know,

535
00:37:11,005 --> 00:37:14,965
Speaker 10:  some other publisher site. And you might be thinking those are really annoying,

536
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:19,045
Speaker 10:  but they are something that is an important revenue stream for a lot of

537
00:37:19,045 --> 00:37:19,565
Speaker 10:  publishers.

538
00:37:19,995 --> 00:37:23,805
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I think that the, the thing you said is, is important to keep

539
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:27,645
Speaker 1:  remembering that Google already lost this case, right? That that yeah,

540
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:30,885
Speaker 1:  they, they, they will inevitably appeal and it's weird that we have to go

541
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:33,045
Speaker 1:  through the remedies before they can get to the appeal, but there's a lot

542
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:36,365
Speaker 1:  of like logistical nonsense in all of this stuff. But

543
00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:40,765
Speaker 1:  as with the search trial, Google lost and the question now is,

544
00:37:40,865 --> 00:37:44,725
Speaker 1:  is what do we do about it? And so the trial is

545
00:37:44,725 --> 00:37:48,445
Speaker 1:  now a few days old And I think you've gotten to get a real sense of what

546
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:52,365
Speaker 1:  both sides want to do here. So let's start with the government. What does

547
00:37:52,365 --> 00:37:56,285
Speaker 1:  the government at this moment think the right answer is at the end

548
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:57,125
Speaker 1:  of this trial?

549
00:37:57,435 --> 00:38:01,245
Speaker 10:  Yeah, so at a high level, the government wants to

550
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:05,005
Speaker 10:  impose both some behavioral changes on Google and what

551
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:08,845
Speaker 10:  it's allowed to do, not allowed to do in terms of its use of ad tech

552
00:38:08,845 --> 00:38:12,805
Speaker 10:  tools. And then it also wants to impose what are called structural

553
00:38:12,805 --> 00:38:16,725
Speaker 10:  remedies or what colloquially we'd call a breakup. So it wants to do

554
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:20,245
Speaker 10:  a few different things. And basically the judge found that Google illegally

555
00:38:20,245 --> 00:38:24,005
Speaker 10:  monopolized the markets for two basically publisher side

556
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:27,885
Speaker 10:  tools. So you have the market for publisher ad servers, which

557
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:31,605
Speaker 10:  Google's double click for publishers or DFP operates in.

558
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:36,005
Speaker 10:  And that is a tool that publishers use to basically manage

559
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:39,325
Speaker 10:  their inventory, manage those boxes on their website that they're selling

560
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:42,965
Speaker 10:  for advertising. And then it also monopolize the market

561
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:47,165
Speaker 10:  for ad exchanges. And that's a tool that basically

562
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:51,205
Speaker 10:  publishers use to get bids from advertisers

563
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:55,245
Speaker 10:  that want to place ads on their website. So it's like the exchange where

564
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:58,165
Speaker 10:  literally these transactions are kind of meeting in the middle.

565
00:38:58,575 --> 00:39:01,565
Speaker 1:  Right. And that's, it's worth saying that that's like, that's two out of

566
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:05,245
Speaker 1:  the three parts of the process. And so, right, like the, the way that I think

567
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:08,165
Speaker 1:  I've come to understand it is basically there's, there's how the advertisers

568
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:12,285
Speaker 1:  say what they want to buy, there's how the people with ad space

569
00:39:12,285 --> 00:39:14,965
Speaker 1:  publishers and whatnot say what they have available. And then there's the

570
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:18,285
Speaker 1:  thing in the middle that connects buyers and sellers. And the, the argument

571
00:39:18,285 --> 00:39:21,845
Speaker 1:  the government made the whole time was that Google is the most popular and

572
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:25,725
Speaker 1:  important player in all three of these things and it uses that power to make

573
00:39:25,745 --> 00:39:29,205
Speaker 1:  all three of those things more expensive and worse to enrich Google. And

574
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:32,805
Speaker 1:  the fact that it lost on two of the three parts of the puzzle

575
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:37,565
Speaker 1:  is a pretty big deal. Right? Like, it, it seems like to me at least

576
00:39:37,565 --> 00:39:41,445
Speaker 1:  coming out of that trial, it was like, oh, Google lost this in a

577
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:45,085
Speaker 1:  pretty meaningful way. Right. Is that how it felt to you? Okay. Yeah,

578
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:48,365
Speaker 10:  No, definitely. And I, we should say that, you know, Google did

579
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:53,045
Speaker 10:  win on one count about its buyer side tools,

580
00:39:53,065 --> 00:39:57,005
Speaker 10:  the advertiser side tools where the judge said that the

581
00:39:57,045 --> 00:40:00,885
Speaker 10:  DOJ didn't prove that it had a monopoly on that side of the market. But

582
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:05,125
Speaker 10:  you know, that side of the market is still obviously relevant to how

583
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:08,805
Speaker 10:  these other tools work because you know, part of the issue

584
00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:12,805
Speaker 10:  is that the judge found that Google illegally tied together its

585
00:40:12,805 --> 00:40:16,445
Speaker 10:  publisher ads or DFP and adx, it's ad

586
00:40:16,645 --> 00:40:20,245
Speaker 10:  exchange and ADX has unique access to

587
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:23,245
Speaker 10:  Google's buy side of the platform as well.

588
00:40:23,615 --> 00:40:26,925
Speaker 1:  Right. And the, the government's case is basically like

589
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:31,365
Speaker 1:  you own all three of these things, you should not be allowed to own all three

590
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:35,205
Speaker 1:  of these things. And so we are going to take at least one, but maybe

591
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:38,285
Speaker 1:  two of them away from you and thus there will be more competition. Right.

592
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:40,045
Speaker 1:  Like is it, it's kind of, is it kind of that straightforward?

593
00:40:40,545 --> 00:40:44,125
Speaker 10:  Pretty much. There's a little bit of complexity. So I think the most straightforward

594
00:40:44,185 --> 00:40:48,165
Speaker 10:  is that they want to have Google divest adx, it's ad exchange

595
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:52,085
Speaker 10:  that sits in the middle there and then it says After

596
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:55,645
Speaker 10:  that we also want Google to have to open source

597
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:59,045
Speaker 10:  what it's calling the final auction logic that sits within

598
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:02,685
Speaker 10:  DFP. Oh interesting. And so that's also a structural remedy.

599
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:07,285
Speaker 10:  And basically what that means is that if DFP is

600
00:41:07,285 --> 00:41:11,045
Speaker 10:  where the final decision happens of who is

601
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:14,965
Speaker 10:  going to get to place this ad on the publisher website. So you

602
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:18,085
Speaker 10:  have bids often from other exchanges that might come through with thing

603
00:41:18,085 --> 00:41:22,005
Speaker 10:  called pre-bid or header bidding. And then you have a, gets

604
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:25,525
Speaker 10:  to decide if it's gonna bid. And then you also have what's called direct

605
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:29,485
Speaker 10:  demand, which is, you know, deals that had already been negotiated

606
00:41:29,585 --> 00:41:32,365
Speaker 10:  and the publisher has to decide, you know, when it's gonna place those.

607
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:36,365
Speaker 10:  And that final decision between those three things happens

608
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:40,445
Speaker 10:  inside of DFP, which publishers say is basically a black

609
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:44,525
Speaker 10:  box and they don't know why anyone wins or loses besides, you know,

610
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:45,205
Speaker 10:  on price.

611
00:41:45,675 --> 00:41:49,325
Speaker 1:  Okay. So you, you mentioned obviously this is a different trial from the

612
00:41:49,325 --> 00:41:52,885
Speaker 1:  other Google trial And I think you And I have both had sort of

613
00:41:52,905 --> 00:41:56,205
Speaker 1:  beaten into our heads the idea that one trial is not necessarily indicative

614
00:41:56,205 --> 00:41:59,165
Speaker 1:  or predictive of another even when they're happening simultaneously. But

615
00:41:59,165 --> 00:42:02,245
Speaker 1:  it does feel like the, the bones of what the government is asking for is

616
00:42:02,245 --> 00:42:06,085
Speaker 1:  the same in both cases where the, the one thing is like, okay, you have to,

617
00:42:06,085 --> 00:42:09,485
Speaker 1:  you have to divest the thing that makes you powerful or at least one of the

618
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:13,405
Speaker 1:  things that makes you powerful and then you have to give everyone

619
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,125
Speaker 1:  kind of the secret sauce. Right? And this is a big thing in, in the search

620
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:19,805
Speaker 1:  trial too, right? Was the idea that like, actually what other

621
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:23,565
Speaker 1:  search engines need is Google's ranking data and, and some

622
00:42:23,565 --> 00:42:27,045
Speaker 1:  like real transparency into how Google actually

623
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:30,885
Speaker 1:  built the thing that is so successful so that they can go and do it too.

624
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:34,845
Speaker 1:  And Google fought that tooth and nail and basically Google's argument

625
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:37,245
Speaker 1:  in the search case was like, actually there's tons of competition, nothing's

626
00:42:37,245 --> 00:42:40,405
Speaker 1:  wrong, you're all idiots, everything's fine. Is that Google's argument here

627
00:42:40,465 --> 00:42:40,685
Speaker 1:  too,

628
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:45,125
Speaker 10:  In a way? I'd say it's a little bit different here in the sense that I think

629
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:49,045
Speaker 10:  Google has, you know, some of their behavioral remedies look somewhat

630
00:42:49,045 --> 00:42:52,925
Speaker 10:  similar to the governments. I I'd say, you know, there's definitely significant

631
00:42:52,925 --> 00:42:54,125
Speaker 10:  differences. Just

632
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:57,965
Speaker 1:  The fact that there are behavioral remedies in Google's mind is is something

633
00:42:58,515 --> 00:43:02,405
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Yeah. I think like in the search case it was more like, we'll do

634
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:06,165
Speaker 10:  we'll stop doing these sorts of contracts that were found to be

635
00:43:06,195 --> 00:43:06,685
Speaker 10:  illegal.

636
00:43:06,755 --> 00:43:09,445
Speaker 1:  They took the word exclusive out of some contracts and were like, is that

637
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:09,685
Speaker 1:  enough?

638
00:43:10,115 --> 00:43:13,365
Speaker 10:  Yeah, yeah. Here they would be, I'd say somewhat

639
00:43:13,365 --> 00:43:17,165
Speaker 10:  substantially changing the ways that its ad tools bid into

640
00:43:17,165 --> 00:43:20,605
Speaker 10:  different places and it would change a good amount of processes, open things

641
00:43:20,605 --> 00:43:24,205
Speaker 10:  up a bit more, but not as far as the government wants to go.

642
00:43:24,425 --> 00:43:28,285
Speaker 10:  And I should also say that a contingency that the DOJ has is that

643
00:43:28,285 --> 00:43:31,725
Speaker 10:  they wanna reserve the right to force Google to also divest

644
00:43:31,805 --> 00:43:34,285
Speaker 10:  DFP if it's other remedies don't do enough.

645
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:35,405
Speaker 1:  Got it. Okay.

646
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:39,245
Speaker 10:  But here I'd say that, you know, different from the search case,

647
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,205
Speaker 10:  the tools that it's trying to get Google to

648
00:43:43,545 --> 00:43:47,525
Speaker 10:  divest or have really been central to the case throughout where

649
00:43:47,785 --> 00:43:51,605
Speaker 10:  during the search trial, you know, Chrome was obviously an important

650
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:55,405
Speaker 10:  place where search is distributed, but it wasn't like the

651
00:43:55,405 --> 00:43:58,285
Speaker 10:  central tool that was like at issue in the trial.

652
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:02,245
Speaker 1:  Yeah. This would be much closer to if the search app was like, or the search

653
00:44:02,245 --> 00:44:05,925
Speaker 1:  trial was demanding that Google sell search. Like that's, yeah.

654
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:09,885
Speaker 1:  That way it's much more direct in that sense. And I think that that

655
00:44:09,885 --> 00:44:13,285
Speaker 1:  might be why it has always felt like Google is on more

656
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:16,485
Speaker 1:  aggressive defense on this one because it is like you're not just

657
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:20,445
Speaker 1:  trying to kind of prop up competitors and, and you know,

658
00:44:20,675 --> 00:44:24,565
Speaker 1:  slap us on the wrist for bad conduct. You're trying to take away

659
00:44:24,565 --> 00:44:28,245
Speaker 1:  the thing that makes us all of our money. Like this is, you know, you mentioned

660
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:30,645
Speaker 1:  this is, this is how a lot of the money moves around the internet. This is

661
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:34,045
Speaker 1:  also how Google makes a lot of its money. Yeah. This is like, it does a lot

662
00:44:34,045 --> 00:44:37,485
Speaker 1:  of, you know, first party ads and stuff, but this is like a, a true money

663
00:44:37,485 --> 00:44:41,085
Speaker 1:  machine for Google and has been for a really long time and

664
00:44:41,585 --> 00:44:45,525
Speaker 1:  the way that this stuff works is a huge economy and so far the biggest

665
00:44:45,525 --> 00:44:49,485
Speaker 1:  beneficiary of it has been Google. And so yeah, it's

666
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:53,485
Speaker 1:  just, it's just been fascinating to me to see Google seem less worried about

667
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:57,365
Speaker 1:  losing Chrome than it seems about losing adx. But I'm actually curious on

668
00:44:57,365 --> 00:44:59,685
Speaker 1:  that front, what it has felt like in the courtroom. 'cause you've now been

669
00:44:59,745 --> 00:45:03,565
Speaker 1:  in both of the remedies trials and you've gotten a sense sort of the,

670
00:45:03,665 --> 00:45:06,725
Speaker 1:  the vibes and the feelings coming from both sides.

671
00:45:07,795 --> 00:45:11,405
Speaker 1:  What has this one been like compared to the search trial? How does it feel

672
00:45:11,405 --> 00:45:13,045
Speaker 1:  just listening to the people talk in the courtroom?

673
00:45:13,355 --> 00:45:16,605
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I think that's an interesting question. You know, it's obviously the

674
00:45:16,605 --> 00:45:19,325
Speaker 10:  different attorneys have, you know, somewhat different styles. So there's

675
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:22,445
Speaker 10:  a little bit of just that probably contributes to it. But, you know, I think

676
00:45:22,915 --> 00:45:26,405
Speaker 10:  this is a case where the divestiture of Chrome

677
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,685
Speaker 10:  maybe felt, you know, I don't know if this was a feeling that was coming

678
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:33,485
Speaker 10:  from within the courtroom or just a general sense of, you know, it,

679
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:37,165
Speaker 10:  it's such a big ask and it's such a big part of the business and that would

680
00:45:37,165 --> 00:45:40,965
Speaker 10:  change so much. So I think just the scale of that felt different in a way.

681
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,965
Speaker 10:  Although I think, you know, it, it feels possibly

682
00:45:45,355 --> 00:45:49,285
Speaker 10:  like this might be a more attainable ask for the government in this case.

683
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:53,605
Speaker 10:  So in a way it feels like there's a lot of practicalities

684
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:57,725
Speaker 10:  being discussed about how this would work. And you know, I

685
00:45:57,725 --> 00:46:00,845
Speaker 10:  think something that I've been thinking over the past few days is there's

686
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:04,645
Speaker 10:  times where I almost have to remind myself like what you said

687
00:46:04,645 --> 00:46:08,485
Speaker 10:  earlier, David, of like Google did lose at least most of this case,

688
00:46:08,885 --> 00:46:12,845
Speaker 10:  right? And I think the Google attorneys at times are, you

689
00:46:12,845 --> 00:46:16,775
Speaker 10:  know, kind of, they're doing an a decent

690
00:46:16,835 --> 00:46:19,975
Speaker 10:  job of kind of making you forget that in a sense,

691
00:46:20,535 --> 00:46:24,375
Speaker 10:  because totally we're talking about, you know, I, I think there's suggestions

692
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:27,535
Speaker 10:  of what would be fair to make Google do and you know, how much engineering

693
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:31,495
Speaker 10:  work would be involved in some of the remedies that the DOJ proposed. But

694
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:35,495
Speaker 10:  you know, we also have to remember that Google lost this case

695
00:46:35,685 --> 00:46:39,335
Speaker 10:  because it was engaged in anti-competitive behavior for

696
00:46:39,935 --> 00:46:43,535
Speaker 10:  a decade. And Google is also arguing things like that

697
00:46:43,725 --> 00:46:47,055
Speaker 10:  this whole category of advertising is declining. But,

698
00:46:47,515 --> 00:46:51,455
Speaker 10:  you know, some of the, the witnesses for the DOJ are saying, well

699
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:55,495
Speaker 10:  yeah, because it's been a market that's been dominated by one

700
00:46:55,495 --> 00:46:59,375
Speaker 10:  player and you have to go through this one player's tools to do

701
00:46:59,535 --> 00:47:03,455
Speaker 10:  these transactions. So it's less attractive to a lot of

702
00:47:03,455 --> 00:47:07,415
Speaker 10:  stakeholders and it's, you know, not a place that people have

703
00:47:07,445 --> 00:47:11,335
Speaker 10:  been wanting to innovate or invest in because the

704
00:47:11,335 --> 00:47:13,895
Speaker 10:  sense is that, you know, all road roads lead back to Google.

705
00:47:14,325 --> 00:47:17,855
Speaker 1:  Yeah, actually I, I was curious about this, there was this whole sort of

706
00:47:18,095 --> 00:47:21,055
Speaker 1:  kerfuffle at the very beginning of this because Google said an a legal filing

707
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:24,615
Speaker 1:  essentially in as many words that the open web is dying. And part of their

708
00:47:24,615 --> 00:47:27,135
Speaker 1:  defense is who cares? The open web is dying. And

709
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:32,125
Speaker 1:  then they went back and amended it to be like, no, no, no, no, just the advertising

710
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:34,885
Speaker 1:  market on the open. And it's like, well first of all those are the same thing.

711
00:47:35,025 --> 00:47:38,925
Speaker 1:  And second of all, you said what you said friend os has

712
00:47:38,925 --> 00:47:42,765
Speaker 1:  that come up? Like has, has this sort of existential crisis of the internet

713
00:47:43,315 --> 00:47:45,365
Speaker 1:  been part of the conversation this week? That

714
00:47:45,425 --> 00:47:49,285
Speaker 10:  Hasn't really come up directly. Yeah, I don't know. You know, it's hard

715
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:52,525
Speaker 10:  to know what Google really meant in that filing in the first place. Yeah,

716
00:47:52,525 --> 00:47:56,125
Speaker 10:  they did revise it to say, I think open web display advertising, which is

717
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:59,845
Speaker 10:  like the main term that is being used in this case and to describe this

718
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:03,565
Speaker 10:  like segment of advertising. But yeah, I think it's come up

719
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:07,445
Speaker 10:  in the sense that, you know, Google wants to point out that

720
00:48:07,715 --> 00:48:11,565
Speaker 10:  this category of ads is on the decline and you know, maybe

721
00:48:11,565 --> 00:48:14,925
Speaker 10:  this won't even be relevant in several years. And of course, you know, we're

722
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:18,725
Speaker 10:  hearing about AI and what role does AI play, but really

723
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:22,445
Speaker 10:  not, not at all to the extent that we heard about AI in the Google search

724
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:24,085
Speaker 10:  remedies trial, right?

725
00:48:24,275 --> 00:48:27,885
Speaker 1:  Yeah. AI was, Google's whole defense in the search remedies trial was that

726
00:48:27,885 --> 00:48:31,805
Speaker 1:  none of this matters because AI is making the, even if we did do all

727
00:48:31,805 --> 00:48:35,325
Speaker 1:  of this for 20 years, it doesn't matter anymore because AI is so important

728
00:48:35,325 --> 00:48:38,485
Speaker 1:  and so powerful that it's upending the market anyway. And I think to a large

729
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:42,285
Speaker 1:  extent, judge Meta in that case was sympathetic to that.

730
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:45,085
Speaker 1:  And I think one of the things I've been thinking a lot about this week is

731
00:48:45,085 --> 00:48:48,925
Speaker 1:  that the, the listening to the questions that the judge

732
00:48:48,985 --> 00:48:52,485
Speaker 1:  was asking in that case actually gave a lot of

733
00:48:52,485 --> 00:48:55,845
Speaker 1:  information away about what was gonna happen in that case. And he was asking

734
00:48:55,965 --> 00:48:59,845
Speaker 1:  a lot of questions about what overreach would look like and, and whether

735
00:49:00,515 --> 00:49:03,645
Speaker 1:  divesting things was actually gonna accomplish the things that they claim

736
00:49:03,665 --> 00:49:07,485
Speaker 1:  to be accomplishing. So it makes me wonder, what,

737
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:10,405
Speaker 1:  what is the judge saying? What kind of questions is the judge asking this

738
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,525
Speaker 1:  week? Has anything kind of piqued your interest?

739
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,725
Speaker 10:  Yeah, yeah. I, I think she's asked some really interesting questions. You

740
00:49:16,725 --> 00:49:20,485
Speaker 10:  know, she has made it very clear that she really wants to hear

741
00:49:20,715 --> 00:49:24,685
Speaker 10:  from technical experts about the feasibility of this. And I think

742
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:28,525
Speaker 10:  especially the DOJs breakup proposals and you know, what would be

743
00:49:28,725 --> 00:49:32,525
Speaker 10:  involved here. And you know, when one industry expert was on the

744
00:49:32,525 --> 00:49:36,445
Speaker 10:  stand, she kind of was dismissive of it and said, you know,

745
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:39,085
Speaker 10:  this is window dressing. You don't need to concern yourself with window

746
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:42,725
Speaker 10:  dressing. Speaking to the attorneys. She's kind of done with the industry

747
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:47,085
Speaker 10:  witnesses who are just testifying about the impact on them because she heard

748
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:50,965
Speaker 10:  a lot of that in the liability trial. So she really wants to get

749
00:49:50,965 --> 00:49:54,605
Speaker 10:  down to the nitty gritty. And I think, you know, there's been questions

750
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:58,605
Speaker 10:  that are probably good for Google, good

751
00:49:58,605 --> 00:50:01,765
Speaker 10:  for the DOJ in maybe relatively equal measure.

752
00:50:02,385 --> 00:50:06,285
Speaker 10:  You know, at one point she kind of said something like, the devil

753
00:50:06,345 --> 00:50:09,925
Speaker 10:  is in the details and worried that the, you know,

754
00:50:10,025 --> 00:50:13,805
Speaker 10:  actual implementation of the technical things here

755
00:50:14,495 --> 00:50:18,365
Speaker 10:  would be a lot more complicated than what's being presented

756
00:50:18,505 --> 00:50:22,405
Speaker 10:  and wondering if the user experience might be different if some

757
00:50:22,405 --> 00:50:26,165
Speaker 10:  of these tools are migrated to another buyer, for example. But

758
00:50:26,165 --> 00:50:30,085
Speaker 10:  we've also heard her ask today about, you know, how

759
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:34,085
Speaker 10:  exactly it would work to open source the final auction logic

760
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:37,805
Speaker 10:  and where that would live and getting an understanding of like what that

761
00:50:38,085 --> 00:50:42,045
Speaker 10:  actually involves. And I think one thing that came up yesterday that

762
00:50:42,045 --> 00:50:45,805
Speaker 10:  was really interesting was there was a Google witness on the stand

763
00:50:46,305 --> 00:50:49,525
Speaker 10:  who helped craft Google's remedies proposals.

764
00:50:50,305 --> 00:50:53,925
Speaker 10:  And this executive also had been involved

765
00:50:54,145 --> 00:50:57,765
Speaker 10:  in a couple of projects that Google did to analyze potentially

766
00:50:57,765 --> 00:51:01,445
Speaker 10:  spinning out atex and you know, kind of doing some of the structural things

767
00:51:01,555 --> 00:51:05,325
Speaker 10:  that the DOJ is talking about in slightly different ways.

768
00:51:05,825 --> 00:51:09,405
Speaker 10:  And Google found that they actually considered shutting down

769
00:51:09,745 --> 00:51:13,365
Speaker 10:  ATX altogether, right? And that seemed to pique the judge's interest. And

770
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:17,325
Speaker 10:  she asked, well, wouldn't that be a very simple and elegant solution here?

771
00:51:17,435 --> 00:51:21,245
Speaker 10:  Because the Google executive was raising the concern of, you know, who's

772
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:25,165
Speaker 10:  gonna buy ATX and doesn't just recreate the problem if another ad exchange

773
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:29,125
Speaker 10:  buys it or another big tech company buys it. So, you know that

774
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,845
Speaker 10:  that was a really interesting thing, especially because that's not even

775
00:51:31,845 --> 00:51:33,805
Speaker 10:  something the DOJ is asking for here.

776
00:51:34,745 --> 00:51:38,245
Speaker 1:  So rather than force them to sell it, just just shut it down altogether.

777
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,805
Speaker 10:  Yeah, because you know, there're,

778
00:51:40,075 --> 00:51:40,565
Speaker 1:  That would be

779
00:51:40,805 --> 00:51:44,165
Speaker 10:  Fascinating. It would because there are actually a lot of ad exchanges

780
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:48,085
Speaker 10:  that are out there that have testified in this trial, right? It's just that

781
00:51:48,085 --> 00:51:51,845
Speaker 10:  they don't have the same access to Google demand as ADX

782
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:55,845
Speaker 10:  does. And you know, it, it's different from the publisher ad servers

783
00:51:55,845 --> 00:51:58,805
Speaker 10:  where Google is pretty much the only player in that market,

784
00:51:59,735 --> 00:52:03,645
Speaker 1:  Right? Yeah. And I think that's, that's again, a key difference between

785
00:52:03,645 --> 00:52:06,285
Speaker 1:  this trial and, and the search trial, right? So much of the search trial

786
00:52:06,345 --> 00:52:10,205
Speaker 1:  hinged on why are there no other good players in this

787
00:52:10,205 --> 00:52:14,045
Speaker 1:  market? Like why is it impossible to build a successful search engine? And

788
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:18,005
Speaker 1:  I just like, I, I will never be able to get Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO

789
00:52:18,025 --> 00:52:21,765
Speaker 1:  out of my head on the stand saying, I would give you all of this

790
00:52:21,825 --> 00:52:25,685
Speaker 1:  for free just to have the query data. And like every, we are all so far

791
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:28,805
Speaker 1:  behind now, there's not a chance anybody can catch up. This is different

792
00:52:28,805 --> 00:52:32,765
Speaker 1:  in that it does seem like it would be more straightforward to

793
00:52:32,765 --> 00:52:36,205
Speaker 1:  just blow the market open and say, well everybody, there are a million potential

794
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:40,365
Speaker 1:  competitors out there, we're just gonna give them the same access that you

795
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:44,205
Speaker 1:  have. And then we'll have a competitive market. Like I just, I grant that

796
00:52:44,225 --> 00:52:47,925
Speaker 1:  I'm very unsophisticated when it comes to how the ad tech market works, but

797
00:52:47,925 --> 00:52:51,725
Speaker 1:  it does seem to me that it would be an easier thing to just

798
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:55,685
Speaker 1:  sort of throw the doors open on this one than it would be to like

799
00:52:56,685 --> 00:52:59,765
Speaker 1:  gin up a way to create 10 new search engines from scratch.

800
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:04,325
Speaker 10:  Yeah. I think at a high level that that's pretty much correct. I think,

801
00:53:04,325 --> 00:53:07,805
Speaker 10:  you know, there are things in place here that just, you know, there, there

802
00:53:07,805 --> 00:53:10,765
Speaker 10:  need to be different pathways opened and that's kind of what they're looking

803
00:53:10,765 --> 00:53:14,445
Speaker 10:  at how exactly to do that. But some of the actual tools do

804
00:53:14,445 --> 00:53:14,765
Speaker 10:  exist.

805
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:19,205
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So what do you think there is to learn from the other trial? Is

806
00:53:19,205 --> 00:53:22,365
Speaker 1:  there, is there, obviously, again, these are different things, different

807
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:26,285
Speaker 1:  judges, every trial is different, on and on and on. Did

808
00:53:26,285 --> 00:53:30,045
Speaker 1:  you, do you see anything happening now that is like rhyming with some of

809
00:53:30,045 --> 00:53:33,085
Speaker 1:  the other trials that you've, you've been sitting in? Is there anything that

810
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:35,085
Speaker 1:  you feel like is being carried forward here?

811
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:39,655
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I mean I, I think in a way it, it's hard to make that assessment

812
00:53:39,795 --> 00:53:43,735
Speaker 10:  yet because we have this one data point of this kind of like new era

813
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:47,815
Speaker 10:  of tech antitrust and that data point is that the judge was willing

814
00:53:47,815 --> 00:53:51,615
Speaker 10:  to call a Google monopoly but wasn't willing to break it up, right?

815
00:53:51,835 --> 00:53:55,695
Speaker 10:  And I think we're kind of in the midst of the second data point and

816
00:53:55,955 --> 00:53:59,175
Speaker 10:  you know, so far it definitely was notable to me that the judge seemed

817
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:03,975
Speaker 10:  wary of, you know, doing something that might further harm the

818
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:07,695
Speaker 10:  market, create a new problem, do something that's just technically

819
00:54:07,755 --> 00:54:11,655
Speaker 10:  not feasible and you know, kind of nonsensical from a technical

820
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:15,455
Speaker 10:  sense. So, you know, I could see that potentially

821
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:19,415
Speaker 10:  being an issue where she worries that some sort of breakup would be

822
00:54:19,555 --> 00:54:23,415
Speaker 10:  too complicated. But on the other hand, perhaps she

823
00:54:23,415 --> 00:54:27,135
Speaker 10:  does end up agreeing with the government that a breakup is really

824
00:54:27,235 --> 00:54:31,215
Speaker 10:  the simplest way to go. That's long been the argument from people who favor

825
00:54:31,695 --> 00:54:35,415
Speaker 10:  structural remedies is, you know, rather than having behavioral changes

826
00:54:35,565 --> 00:54:38,975
Speaker 10:  that require a court to appoint someone to

827
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:43,215
Speaker 10:  look after a lot of changes and make sure that the company's staying

828
00:54:43,535 --> 00:54:47,415
Speaker 10:  compliant, that, you know, structural changes, it'll take some

829
00:54:47,415 --> 00:54:50,615
Speaker 10:  time to get there, but once it's done, it's done. It's a separate company.

830
00:54:50,685 --> 00:54:54,095
Speaker 10:  It's not owned by Google anymore. Right. So I think it'll be interesting

831
00:54:54,095 --> 00:54:57,935
Speaker 10:  to see which way that goes and whether Judge

832
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:02,055
Speaker 10:  Meta's ruling is instructive to that or if it

833
00:55:02,235 --> 00:55:03,655
Speaker 10:  is ultimately an outlier.

834
00:55:04,085 --> 00:55:07,375
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I think the behavioral remedies piece of it to me is really interesting

835
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:10,975
Speaker 1:  because it, it's so much of what has happened in this trial

836
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:15,255
Speaker 1:  has been about bringing to light the shady stuff that nobody knew that Google

837
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:18,935
Speaker 1:  was doing. Yeah. And I think about like all the, the first look and last

838
00:55:18,935 --> 00:55:21,735
Speaker 1:  look stuff that Google was giving itself, which to me is like the most sort

839
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:25,255
Speaker 1:  of straightforward version of what you're able to do when you control the

840
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:28,975
Speaker 1:  whole ecosystem, which is Google would run a whole fair bidding process and

841
00:55:28,975 --> 00:55:32,775
Speaker 1:  then give itself a last chance to win. Yeah. And it was just like,

842
00:55:32,965 --> 00:55:35,895
Speaker 1:  what if you could see the winner of every auction and just decide whether

843
00:55:35,895 --> 00:55:39,855
Speaker 1:  you wanted to win it is like pretty clearly unfair and

844
00:55:39,855 --> 00:55:43,815
Speaker 1:  is is not the kind of thing that Google was like, you know, advertising that

845
00:55:43,815 --> 00:55:47,615
Speaker 1:  it was doing. And so I think this idea that suddenly someone is gonna be

846
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:50,535
Speaker 1:  able to come in and like immediately suss that stuff out just seems

847
00:55:51,145 --> 00:55:54,495
Speaker 1:  suspicious. And so I like it, it seems obvious to me that that's what Google

848
00:55:54,505 --> 00:55:57,775
Speaker 1:  would want because you're like, we're gonna have this person who part of

849
00:55:57,775 --> 00:56:00,655
Speaker 1:  their job is to try and see what we're doing and

850
00:56:01,805 --> 00:56:05,175
Speaker 1:  yeah, you can see why it is cleaner to just be like, no, just, just stop

851
00:56:05,175 --> 00:56:09,095
Speaker 1:  having adx be yours. But also why that causes a whole set

852
00:56:09,095 --> 00:56:13,055
Speaker 1:  of other problems. So I think, yeah, I, where this judge lands on

853
00:56:13,605 --> 00:56:17,415
Speaker 1:  sort of feasibility versus success, I think is gonna be really fascinating

854
00:56:17,755 --> 00:56:19,015
Speaker 1:  and seems hard to know at this point.

855
00:56:19,365 --> 00:56:22,655
Speaker 10:  Yeah, and that's something that the DOJ brought up in their opening arguments

856
00:56:22,895 --> 00:56:26,725
Speaker 10:  actually, actually that, you know, this is such a complicated space and

857
00:56:26,985 --> 00:56:30,325
Speaker 10:  you know, it, it's not hard to imagine Google being able to

858
00:56:31,245 --> 00:56:34,965
Speaker 10:  bury some code or some change that's difficult to detect

859
00:56:35,155 --> 00:56:37,445
Speaker 10:  that kind of recreates a problem all over again.

860
00:56:37,825 --> 00:56:41,805
Speaker 1:  All right, so you have another week of the Google trial and then some

861
00:56:41,805 --> 00:56:44,565
Speaker 1:  amount of time and then we'll get an answer from the judge. Is that, is that

862
00:56:44,565 --> 00:56:45,325
Speaker 1:  what we're in for here?

863
00:56:45,585 --> 00:56:49,045
Speaker 10:  That's what we're in for and you know, remember this is the rocket docket

864
00:56:49,185 --> 00:56:52,565
Speaker 10:  in the Eastern District of Virginia, right? So, you know, that is

865
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:56,765
Speaker 10:  speedy in terms of legal time, not in terms of real people

866
00:56:56,765 --> 00:56:59,645
Speaker 10:  time, but you know, that said, we could get a decision,

867
00:57:00,665 --> 00:57:04,205
Speaker 10:  you know, if you think about in the search case, which is, you know, not

868
00:57:04,455 --> 00:57:08,205
Speaker 10:  known as a speedy court, we had the remedies trial,

869
00:57:08,485 --> 00:57:12,405
Speaker 10:  I believe in March or April, and then we got the decision I

870
00:57:12,405 --> 00:57:16,285
Speaker 10:  think at very beginning of September. So, you know, if I would think

871
00:57:16,285 --> 00:57:19,485
Speaker 10:  maybe a much shorter timeframe than that to get a decision here.

872
00:57:19,875 --> 00:57:23,725
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So it, it does seem like this is, this is one where there's

873
00:57:23,725 --> 00:57:24,485
Speaker 1:  just a lot hanging

874
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:26,755
Speaker 16:  power user of YouTube as I listen to several minutes,

875
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:30,715
Speaker 16:  sometimes hours a day, a lot of my

876
01:00:31,355 --> 01:00:34,595
Speaker 16:  podcasts, a lot of just general content on there.

877
01:00:35,825 --> 01:00:38,955
Speaker 16:  It's basically my main source of media consumption.

878
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:45,085
Speaker 16:  And lately I've noticed that Gemini does

879
01:00:45,085 --> 01:00:49,005
Speaker 16:  an incredible job of summarizing these videos And

880
01:00:49,085 --> 01:00:52,885
Speaker 16:  I never realized the extent to which, especially as a busy

881
01:00:53,065 --> 01:00:55,925
Speaker 16:  family man who has very few

882
01:00:56,795 --> 01:01:00,285
Speaker 16:  minutes or hours to spare in the day. I never knew how much

883
01:01:00,965 --> 01:01:04,125
Speaker 16:  I watched YouTube videos just to get information. And the reason I know

884
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:07,605
Speaker 16:  this is because I started asking Gemini

885
01:01:07,945 --> 01:01:10,885
Speaker 16:  to summarize videos for me and it gives me a quick,

886
01:01:11,845 --> 01:01:15,565
Speaker 16:  accurate, factual breakdown of the main points of a video.

887
01:01:16,145 --> 01:01:20,005
Speaker 16:  Is this an existential concern for YouTube creators? Am

888
01:01:20,045 --> 01:01:23,725
Speaker 16:  I the only weird one doing this? Could this become a trend?

889
01:01:24,135 --> 01:01:25,045
Speaker 16:  Would love your thoughts.

890
01:01:25,355 --> 01:01:28,365
Speaker 1:  Okay, I I love this question for a bunch of reasons because one,

891
01:01:29,245 --> 01:01:32,565
Speaker 1:  Roy, you are not the only person doing this. Two, this is

892
01:01:32,575 --> 01:01:36,125
Speaker 1:  incredibly intended behavior. This is what Google and all of these companies

893
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,725
Speaker 1:  want you to do is summarize things with ai. And three

894
01:01:40,965 --> 01:01:44,685
Speaker 1:  summarization is one of the things that AI is actually very good at. I think

895
01:01:44,685 --> 01:01:48,485
Speaker 1:  if you ask open-ended questions of an AI bot or a large language model of

896
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:52,045
Speaker 1:  any kind, you, you run all kinds of risks, right? Things get really

897
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:55,565
Speaker 1:  complicated, things go off in weird directions, but if you just give it a

898
01:01:55,565 --> 01:01:59,365
Speaker 1:  body of work and say, make this shorter, it's actually very

899
01:01:59,475 --> 01:02:02,245
Speaker 1:  good at that. And so you see a lot of these tools out there now that are

900
01:02:02,245 --> 01:02:06,045
Speaker 1:  like feeding a book to an AI model in order

901
01:02:06,045 --> 01:02:09,925
Speaker 1:  to get a summary back. And then it's like, well, you've now read

902
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:13,365
Speaker 1:  the book and like you haven't, you've read a summary of the book and that's

903
01:02:13,365 --> 01:02:16,965
Speaker 1:  fine, but the summaries are often very good. And I've even started doing

904
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:20,565
Speaker 1:  it in my own research with a lot of like white papers and studies. It's a

905
01:02:20,565 --> 01:02:24,405
Speaker 1:  really great way to just like quickly digest a lot of information. And I

906
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:28,205
Speaker 1:  think one of the fascinating things about YouTube is that it is

907
01:02:28,205 --> 01:02:32,125
Speaker 1:  both a very good and a wildly inefficient way

908
01:02:32,465 --> 01:02:35,245
Speaker 1:  to just consume information, right? Like if you wanna watch a video because

909
01:02:35,245 --> 01:02:38,525
Speaker 1:  it's fun or it's interesting or it's visual or you like the people or whatever,

910
01:02:38,905 --> 01:02:42,805
Speaker 1:  that's fine. But like my favorite example of this is always when

911
01:02:42,805 --> 01:02:46,405
Speaker 1:  I have like some very small DIY house project to do And

912
01:02:46,925 --> 01:02:50,885
Speaker 1:  I just want to know how to take the thing out and

913
01:02:50,885 --> 01:02:54,805
Speaker 1:  then put the other thing in without burning my house down. And what I have

914
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:57,725
Speaker 1:  to watch is eight minutes of intro video

915
01:02:58,465 --> 01:03:02,405
Speaker 1:  before I get there. And another version of this that exists on the internet

916
01:03:02,405 --> 01:03:06,085
Speaker 1:  is like the recipe websites where it's like I go to a recipe site And I have

917
01:03:06,085 --> 01:03:09,365
Speaker 1:  to read 2000 words and scroll past 12 ads just to get to the recipe.

918
01:03:09,795 --> 01:03:13,765
Speaker 1:  Like that exists, not because that's what the creators wanna

919
01:03:13,765 --> 01:03:16,365
Speaker 1:  do, but because that's how they have to make a business out of it, right?

920
01:03:16,365 --> 01:03:20,325
Speaker 1:  Like all of the data on that recipe webpage is structured in such a

921
01:03:20,325 --> 01:03:23,045
Speaker 1:  way that Google will find it and rank it so that you will click on it and

922
01:03:23,045 --> 01:03:26,965
Speaker 1:  see it. And YouTube is very much the same way, right? Like videos are longer

923
01:03:27,105 --> 01:03:30,885
Speaker 1:  so that people can show more ads in the middle. The longer videos

924
01:03:30,905 --> 01:03:34,285
Speaker 1:  are the more watch time they get, which means they'll get surface more. And

925
01:03:34,285 --> 01:03:37,685
Speaker 1:  it's just this incredible flywheel of things you have to do in order for

926
01:03:37,685 --> 01:03:41,325
Speaker 1:  the platform to give you the kind of audience and access that you need in

927
01:03:41,325 --> 01:03:45,175
Speaker 1:  order to be successful. So it is a

928
01:03:45,195 --> 01:03:47,895
Speaker 1:  Gemini summary of a YouTube video, an existential threat to the creator of

929
01:03:47,895 --> 01:03:51,815
Speaker 1:  that YouTube video. Absolutely unequivocally yes, if, if everyone

930
01:03:51,825 --> 01:03:54,615
Speaker 1:  stops watching YouTube videos and starts getting summaries of those YouTube

931
01:03:54,615 --> 01:03:54,855
Speaker 1:  videos,

932
01:03:56,605 --> 01:04:00,335
Speaker 1:  it's the end of that business for people on YouTube. We, you

933
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:04,255
Speaker 1:  become a, a person who is making training data, not a person who

934
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:08,175
Speaker 1:  is making content that people want to actually consume on YouTube. So

935
01:04:08,175 --> 01:04:12,135
Speaker 1:  like cast it out long enough and make that activity

936
01:04:12,545 --> 01:04:16,335
Speaker 1:  mainstream enough and it absolutely all falls apart. The whole thing falls

937
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:19,495
Speaker 1:  apart. And this is what, this is what nobody in this industry is reckoning

938
01:04:19,495 --> 01:04:22,855
Speaker 1:  with right now is if all of this stuff works, it all collapses.

939
01:04:23,275 --> 01:04:26,175
Speaker 1:  But that is, that is an existential crisis of my own that we don't have to

940
01:04:26,355 --> 01:04:30,335
Speaker 1:  do right now. So I think what, what I would say, and,

941
01:04:30,435 --> 01:04:34,415
Speaker 1:  and this is just my own way of thinking about like how do I support the

942
01:04:34,575 --> 01:04:38,455
Speaker 1:  internet in a way that works for everybody, is like,

943
01:04:39,025 --> 01:04:43,015
Speaker 1:  watch the videos as as many as you can and as often as

944
01:04:43,015 --> 01:04:46,695
Speaker 1:  you can, but also understand that if what you want is a piece of

945
01:04:46,975 --> 01:04:50,215
Speaker 1:  information and that if the video is not giving it to you in the most efficient

946
01:04:50,215 --> 01:04:54,055
Speaker 1:  way, you shouldn't feel bad about not watching

947
01:04:54,055 --> 01:04:56,815
Speaker 1:  the whole video. You are not obligated to watch things just because they

948
01:04:56,815 --> 01:04:59,455
Speaker 1:  exist. And if what you want is a piece of information on how to take something

949
01:04:59,455 --> 01:05:03,255
Speaker 1:  out of your wall, it's okay to find the most efficient version

950
01:05:03,315 --> 01:05:06,335
Speaker 1:  of that information. And frankly, I think the fact that 10 minute YouTube

951
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:10,055
Speaker 1:  videos is the most efficient version of information is like insane on its

952
01:05:10,055 --> 01:05:13,615
Speaker 1:  own. But watch the things that you wanna watch, go

953
01:05:14,295 --> 01:05:17,845
Speaker 1:  actively consume the things made by the creators that you like.

954
01:05:18,035 --> 01:05:21,965
Speaker 1:  That that is the thing, the all of the rest of the business and

955
01:05:21,965 --> 01:05:25,845
Speaker 1:  the system and the economy of it all works. If you consume

956
01:05:26,145 --> 01:05:29,965
Speaker 1:  the stuff that you like as often as you can, it, I like

957
01:05:30,545 --> 01:05:33,685
Speaker 1:  it. It is not exactly that simple, but it's close enough to that simple that

958
01:05:33,685 --> 01:05:37,485
Speaker 1:  that's reasonable advice that I can give you. Is it, when

959
01:05:37,485 --> 01:05:40,805
Speaker 1:  you're looking for a piece of information, look for it in the most efficient

960
01:05:40,805 --> 01:05:43,245
Speaker 1:  way possible. And I think in many ways, as we've talked about on this show,

961
01:05:44,025 --> 01:05:46,885
Speaker 1:  AI search engines are really powerful for that. If what you need is sort

962
01:05:46,885 --> 01:05:50,005
Speaker 1:  of a, a piece of data in the haystack of the internet,

963
01:05:51,665 --> 01:05:55,405
Speaker 1:  AI bots and AI search are better at that than Google. And

964
01:05:55,835 --> 01:05:59,725
Speaker 1:  that is a thing that is going to change a lot about how the internet

965
01:05:59,725 --> 01:06:03,525
Speaker 1:  works and how money flows around the internet. And we haven't fully shaken

966
01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:06,325
Speaker 1:  that out yet, but you as a consumer should not feel bad using the best product.

967
01:06:07,185 --> 01:06:10,005
Speaker 1:  But if what you care about is that the creators who make the things that

968
01:06:10,005 --> 01:06:13,765
Speaker 1:  you like, continue to be able to make the things that you like, consume those

969
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:17,005
Speaker 1:  things, don't summarize the things and let that be enough because it's not,

970
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:21,085
Speaker 1:  you should be engaging with the things that you like as often as possible.

971
01:06:21,105 --> 01:06:25,085
Speaker 1:  And also like tell your friends and put the video on in the background and

972
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:27,485
Speaker 1:  mute your computer and just let it play on their playlist for a long time.

973
01:06:27,715 --> 01:06:31,445
Speaker 1:  This is like do it with VERGE videos. If you wanna watch 700

974
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:34,125
Speaker 1:  consecutive hours of The Vergecast without ever watching any of it on YouTube,

975
01:06:34,205 --> 01:06:37,725
Speaker 1:  I have no problem with that. I would love that. We'd be very grateful. All

976
01:06:37,725 --> 01:06:41,445
Speaker 1:  of this is to say yes, it's all an existential crisis. And

977
01:06:41,545 --> 01:06:45,485
Speaker 1:  no, it's not generally your problem to fix it by

978
01:06:45,485 --> 01:06:49,285
Speaker 1:  never touching AI summaries. And I think if you feel morally

979
01:06:49,525 --> 01:06:53,485
Speaker 1:  icky about some of these things, you're right to, and you should lean into

980
01:06:53,485 --> 01:06:57,365
Speaker 1:  that. But you also are not required to feel bad all the time. I hope

981
01:06:57,365 --> 01:07:00,205
Speaker 1:  that helps. Welcome to my own existential crisis. This is what we do here.

982
01:07:00,585 --> 01:07:03,965
Speaker 1:  Anyway, that's it for The Vergecast today. More existential crises to come,

983
01:07:03,975 --> 01:07:07,925
Speaker 1:  presumably in every episode forever. But for now, The Vergecast is The Verge

984
01:07:07,925 --> 01:07:10,885
Speaker 1:  production and part of the Vox Media podcast network. The show is produced

985
01:07:11,185 --> 01:07:14,965
Speaker 1:  by Eric Gomez, Brandon Keefer, and Travis Uck. You can always email us

986
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:18,405
Speaker 1:  vergecast at The Verge dot com. You can always call the hotline, send me

987
01:07:18,665 --> 01:07:22,205
Speaker 1:  non malware filled Google Drive links with selfie questions to your videos.

988
01:07:22,465 --> 01:07:26,285
Speaker 1:  We love hearing all of them. We'll be back on Friday with

989
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:29,405
Speaker 1:  lots more news. We've got a lot of smart home stuff to talk about this week.

990
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:33,405
Speaker 1:  Some big stuff going on. We're gonna talk about all of it. All the AI stuff,

991
01:07:33,825 --> 01:07:37,445
Speaker 1:  all of our feelings, and all of our existential crises. Until then,

992
01:07:37,615 --> 01:07:39,165
Speaker 1:  we'll see you next time. Rock and roll.
