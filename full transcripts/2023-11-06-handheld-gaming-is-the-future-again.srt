00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:44,175
Speaker 4:  Welcome To. The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Thumbs Sticks. I'm your

3
00:00:44,175 --> 00:00:48,055
Speaker 4:  friend, David Pierce, and this is the first in a new mini series of

4
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:51,855
Speaker 4:  episodes that we've made all about the future of gaming. We're doing this

5
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:54,855
Speaker 4:  series, as you might expect with some of our friends from Polygon, Chris

6
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:58,655
Speaker 4:  Plant and Russ Frushtick. And we're gonna talk about some of the

7
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:02,495
Speaker 4:  biggest open questions and big ideas that we're thinking about

8
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:07,055
Speaker 4:  in the gaming world in general. It's gonna be very fun this week. For instance,

9
00:01:07,265 --> 00:01:10,655
Speaker 4:  we're talking about handheld gaming. You know the, the switches and the steam

10
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:14,495
Speaker 4:  decks and the Rock allies and the analog pockets and

11
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:18,375
Speaker 4:  the Neo and all the things on Amazon whose names I

12
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:21,615
Speaker 4:  can't pronounce, but seem to be selling very well. Basically the question

13
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:25,095
Speaker 4:  is Is this portable all in one form factor.

14
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:29,135
Speaker 4:  The future of gaming like is the Game Boy Back. That's really all I want

15
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:32,015
Speaker 4:  to know. I'm gonna consult with Chris and Russ and then I'm gonna go out

16
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:34,855
Speaker 4:  and see if I can find some answers. I'm gonna talk to people, I'm gonna do

17
00:01:34,855 --> 00:01:37,975
Speaker 4:  some research, and then I'm gonna bring back what I found out and see if

18
00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:40,455
Speaker 4:  they agree about the future of gaming. Let's get into it.

19
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:43,135
Speaker 4:  Chris Plant. Hello.

20
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:44,295
Speaker 5:  Hey, how you doing?

21
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:48,335
Speaker 4:  Russ Frushtick. Hello. Hello. Welcome. To. The Vergecast. It's been a million

22
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:51,255
Speaker 4:  years since we've had Polygon people in The Vergecast, and it's because we

23
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:54,215
Speaker 4:  hate your guts. But I'm very excited to have both of you here. This is very

24
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:54,535
Speaker 4:  exciting.

25
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:58,495
Speaker 5:  I respect that sometimes you do need interesting things to talk about and

26
00:01:58,495 --> 00:01:59,655
Speaker 5:  that's when we show up.

27
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:04,735
Speaker 4:  That sounds about right. And speaking up. So the way that we've set this

28
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:08,135
Speaker 4:  series up is basically for the next three episodes we're gonna take on sort

29
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:12,015
Speaker 4:  of three big things happening in gaming. And

30
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:15,895
Speaker 4:  the way it's gonna work is that I'm an idiot. That's not like a shtick. That's

31
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:18,695
Speaker 4:  just largely true, especially when it comes to video games and you guys are

32
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:21,735
Speaker 4:  not, so what what we're all gonna do is try and sort of answer questions

33
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:26,015
Speaker 4:  together and you're essentially going to send me on some adventure

34
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:28,855
Speaker 4:  and I'm gonna have to go figure out what is going on and come back and see

35
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:32,255
Speaker 4:  if I've learned anything real and true. That feels right. Does that make

36
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:33,735
Speaker 4:  sense to you guys? This work? Hell yeah.

37
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:37,655
Speaker 5:  Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I will also rebut, you're not an idiot.

38
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:41,695
Speaker 5:  I I wouldn't say that. I would say we know a lot about like the, the

39
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:45,615
Speaker 5:  beeps and the boops, right? We can talk about the Pac Mans and the Assassins

40
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:49,375
Speaker 5:  Creed. You have the brain that tells me how do these things work,

41
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:53,655
Speaker 5:  right? I, I feel like if I look at a sheet of code, I say throw it over

42
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:55,655
Speaker 5:  to The Verge, they'll figure it out. Also,

43
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:58,695
Speaker 6:  If I need a printer, I know the guy who's gonna get it for me.

44
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:02,525
Speaker 4:  Listen, if you need printers, we've got you. Yeah. So the first thing we've

45
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:05,085
Speaker 4:  decided to talk about, which I think is actually like a perfect crossover

46
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:08,965
Speaker 4:  of all of our interests, is handheld gaming. This is a thing that

47
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:12,925
Speaker 4:  I have been sort of rooting for for many years. Like

48
00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:16,205
Speaker 4:  going back to a bunch of years ago there was this company called Shadow that

49
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:20,005
Speaker 4:  was like, we're just gonna stream a Windows PC so that you can play all of

50
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:23,205
Speaker 4:  your games on a Windows pc, but it's in the cloud so you can do it anywhere

51
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:26,125
Speaker 4:  you want. And I was like, that's the best idea ever. And it failed for a

52
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:29,165
Speaker 4:  bunch of what turned out to be extremely predictable reasons. Really quick,

53
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,205
Speaker 4:  let's just sort of set the scene on where we are right now. I feel like we

54
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:34,845
Speaker 4:  talk a lot about the Nintendo Switch. We talk a lot about the Steam deck,

55
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:38,645
Speaker 4:  but in this like reboot phase of

56
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:42,325
Speaker 4:  handheld gaming, how big is this market? Like how much do people actually

57
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:44,125
Speaker 4:  care about what's happening with handhelds?

58
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:48,205
Speaker 6:  Well, you mentioned the Switch. I mean that really, I think rebooted the

59
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:51,285
Speaker 6:  whole concept of, hey, there's money to be made here. There's been a number

60
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:55,125
Speaker 6:  of handheld over the years, the Sony PSP, the Sony Vita, which were

61
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,885
Speaker 6:  like, beloved, sure, but realistically not very successful. So the Switch

62
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:02,645
Speaker 6:  proved them, oh, there's actually money here. And Val

63
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:06,205
Speaker 6:  followed suit and made their own with the steam deck as you mentioned. And

64
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:09,965
Speaker 6:  since then we've seen a number of other companies jump into this space and

65
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:13,805
Speaker 6:  there is so much demand for it that I, I mean it's great 'cause honestly

66
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:16,125
Speaker 6:  it just allows for way more flexibility in terms of gaming.

67
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:20,445
Speaker 5:  And then I, I would say the market is even bigger with all of your

68
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:24,405
Speaker 5:  mobile games, your, your smartphones, your iOS devices and Android

69
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:28,245
Speaker 5:  and tablets. I really sound like a real Verge person right now.

70
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:32,365
Speaker 5:  I I can't wait to be shredded for saying your iOS

71
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:36,085
Speaker 5:  devices, but no, I, I think there are kind of three phases

72
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:40,005
Speaker 5:  to what got us here. One is the iPhone launching

73
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:44,405
Speaker 5:  and the app store with it, and then I, that sort of phase of

74
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:48,285
Speaker 5:  social gaming. There is the end of the

75
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:52,645
Speaker 5:  Nintendo formula, which was yeah, the DSS and the three dss, which is where

76
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:56,565
Speaker 5:  you had to kind of design games for that system. Right? And then the switch

77
00:04:57,065 --> 00:05:00,405
Speaker 5:  in Steam deck, what they really changed, I think, and why I think it's it's

78
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:04,285
Speaker 5:  really blown up is a lot of what is being designed for PC

79
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:07,885
Speaker 5:  or Xbox or PlayStation can now also be

80
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:11,645
Speaker 5:  handheld. So it, it's not just that like, oh,

81
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:15,725
Speaker 5:  Handheld is blowing up. It's that the line between traditional gaming

82
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:18,845
Speaker 5:  and handheld is, is blurrier than ever before.

83
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,005
Speaker 4:  Right. And it seems like if we're also headed into this phase of cloud gaming

84
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:25,285
Speaker 4:  being the thing, and it's like most of the work of

85
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:29,845
Speaker 4:  really powerful gaming hardware can happen somewhere else. The

86
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:32,125
Speaker 4:  recipe should be right. Pure.

87
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:33,445
Speaker 5:  We'll see, we'll see. Yeah,

88
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:36,285
Speaker 6:  Maybe that's something you're gonna look into, but I think we're not quite

89
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:36,645
Speaker 6:  there yet.

90
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:41,005
Speaker 5:  Intense skepticism. But I, I would say devices are more

91
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:44,365
Speaker 5:  powerful than ever that your new iPhone can play the brand new resident evil.

92
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:48,205
Speaker 5:  Maybe you don't even need the cloud gaming part of it. That doesn't work,

93
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:49,725
Speaker 5:  but we'll, we'll get to that.

94
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:53,565
Speaker 4:  Okay. I think that's right. So, okay. I'm still trying to figure out what

95
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:56,045
Speaker 4:  sort of the big overarching question is here, right? Because on the one hand

96
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:59,845
Speaker 4:  you have, how big is this gonna be? 'cause like you guys said, we've been

97
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:03,085
Speaker 4:  at this for a while and I think, I think we have to throw the iPhone out.

98
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:07,045
Speaker 4:  This is gonna be my, my hottest take so far is that I think if we talk about

99
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:10,845
Speaker 4:  mobile phone gaming, you end up just down a completely different road. And

100
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:13,045
Speaker 4:  it's like, yes, everybody has a mobile phone, everybody plays games on it.

101
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:16,285
Speaker 4:  I think we can just like mark that as like done checked on the checkbox.

102
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:20,525
Speaker 4:  I wanna talk about like gaming specific devices and that

103
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:24,365
Speaker 4:  goes all the way down from like the, the things you have to like emulate

104
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:27,725
Speaker 4:  old Game boy games, like the analog pocket, which everyone's obsessed with.

105
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:30,605
Speaker 4:  And then from there all the way up to like the steam deck, which is essentially

106
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:34,485
Speaker 4:  just trying to be like a gaming PC in your, in your hands. Is that a fair

107
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:35,205
Speaker 4:  way to define this?

108
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:39,565
Speaker 6:  I think So I think the larger question that you're trying to answer is, is

109
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:43,525
Speaker 6:  this the norm? So when Sony or Microsoft creates

110
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:47,285
Speaker 6:  their next console, are they making it with handheld gaming in mind?

111
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:51,285
Speaker 6:  Whereas right now they are not. And is this just the future we're gonna

112
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,285
Speaker 6:  live in from now on?

113
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:56,525
Speaker 5:  And that's why I wouldn't rush to throw out your iPhone on this

114
00:06:56,525 --> 00:07:00,325
Speaker 5:  case because I think that Apple is trying to start

115
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:04,245
Speaker 5:  to pull these like AAA games the same year that they come out onto the

116
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:08,205
Speaker 5:  iPhone. That raises the question of are they even trying to finally, I mean,

117
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:10,925
Speaker 5:  it's a forever question You know, I don't wanna be Charlie Brown missing

118
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:15,045
Speaker 5:  the football here, but like, are they also trying

119
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:18,965
Speaker 5:  to get into this? If, if handheld is the future of gaming, they're the best

120
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,645
Speaker 5:  positioned to take advantage of that.

121
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:24,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Resident Evil four is not a Handheld game that is like a

122
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:28,085
Speaker 6:  game that you would play on a plays Station five or an Xbox or a gaming pc.

123
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:32,405
Speaker 6:  The fact that it's running on an iPhone is crazy. So it is

124
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:36,325
Speaker 6:  genuinely kind of a new era for mobile games in ways that it was

125
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:40,205
Speaker 6:  not previously, but you're right. It's, it has been a struggle to get people

126
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:40,605
Speaker 6:  to do that.

127
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:43,845
Speaker 4:  Okay. All, right. So maybe the question I need to go figure out is basically

128
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:48,245
Speaker 4:  the people who make games and make the hardware to run them, are

129
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:51,805
Speaker 4:  they thinking about you holding a device in your hands

130
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:55,965
Speaker 4:  or is it just another screen on which you can play games, right? Like is

131
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:59,245
Speaker 4:  handheld gonna change the way that we play games or is it just gonna be another

132
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,365
Speaker 4:  way to play Resident Evil feels like kind of the big open question here.

133
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:06,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah, and I, and I think there are comparisons in other pop culture. You

134
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,485
Speaker 5:  know the shift to people watching movies on their iPhones and

135
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:13,405
Speaker 5:  Christopher Nolan Getting Furious or the car test when

136
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:17,365
Speaker 5:  you are mixing pop music and making sure that It works as well

137
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:21,125
Speaker 5:  on a car radio or like cheap headphones as it would anywhere else. I'm curious

138
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:24,805
Speaker 5:  is, is that something people are thinking about when they design games

139
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:28,605
Speaker 5:  now? Because especially everything from like the text on the screen

140
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:33,125
Speaker 5:  to having control options there, there's a lot that goes into how

141
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,965
Speaker 5:  you designed for it and yeah, I'm, I'm curious what you'll find out.

142
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:39,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah, you're just trying to get me to really piss off all the purists. That's

143
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:42,645
Speaker 4:  what I'm hearing here. Everyone who believes in like the fidelity of the

144
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:45,805
Speaker 4:  sound and the frame rates is gonna hate me at the end of this episode. And

145
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:46,805
Speaker 4:  it's gonna be your fault, Chris.

146
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,565
Speaker 6:  Well it's funny 'cause the purists are playing old game boy color games

147
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:54,285
Speaker 6:  on their like, ancient game boy hardware. So like they'll be on board.

148
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:58,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And, and like video game purists are like notoriously calm and

149
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:00,485
Speaker 5:  chill, so like that is true. Yeah, it

150
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:03,445
Speaker 4:  Should be fine. Yeah. Ev everything will go fine. Are you guys handheld gamers?

151
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:04,965
Speaker 6:  Almost exclusively.

152
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:06,285
Speaker 5:  We're parents, of course.

153
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:07,965
Speaker 4:  What do you guys play? It's

154
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:11,285
Speaker 6:  Usually a steam deck since it launched. I know a plant uses the

155
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:15,405
Speaker 6:  ACEs Rock ally quite a bit, but yeah, I'm, I'm a Steam Deck

156
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:17,165
Speaker 6:  person through and through. Love

157
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:21,045
Speaker 5:  It. Yeah. And they're interchangeable in my opinion. I, I use the ROG

158
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:24,565
Speaker 5:  because I'm playing it on a couch and I can have it plugged in and the

159
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:28,365
Speaker 5:  resolution is slightly better and the frame rate is slightly better. But

160
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:32,005
Speaker 5:  the steam deck may be my favorite console of all time.

161
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:36,165
Speaker 6:  But I also use a MIU Mini, which is like a tiny little retro Handheld

162
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:39,725
Speaker 6:  gaming device. So like, it kind of depends on the situation and I think you're

163
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:43,005
Speaker 6:  gonna find that a lot of people are looking for a lot of different things

164
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:44,405
Speaker 6:  from Handheld gaming these days.

165
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:48,045
Speaker 4:  I like it. Alright, we are gonna take a break and then through the magic

166
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,205
Speaker 4:  of time and editing, I'm gonna go talk to some people. I'm gonna come back

167
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:53,645
Speaker 4:  with some answers. We're gonna see what we can figure out. Thank you both.

168
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:54,325
Speaker 4:  We'll be right back.

169
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,425
Speaker 4:  All, right? Welcome back. It's been a few weeks. We're back in the studio.

170
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:02,745
Speaker 4:  Chris Russ still here. How are your lives? How are things? I,

171
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:06,385
Speaker 6:  My son is sick so he is stuck at home and I'm just surviving,

172
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:07,465
Speaker 6:  so things have been great.

173
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:11,105
Speaker 5:  I'm doing great. I've never felt more alive.

174
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:15,465
Speaker 4:  All, right. So you, you sent me off to find out what is the deal with Handheld

175
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:18,905
Speaker 4:  Gaming. I have figured out the deal with handheld gaming. Yeah. This went

176
00:11:18,905 --> 00:11:22,625
Speaker 4:  totally differently than I expected. I have come back absolutely

177
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:26,425
Speaker 4:  a hundred percent convinced that handheld is the future of gaming in

178
00:11:26,515 --> 00:11:30,425
Speaker 4:  every meaningful mainstream way. I think this, this is

179
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:34,265
Speaker 4:  the answer, I don't know if it's the 25 year answer, but I think the next

180
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:38,305
Speaker 4:  10 years of gaming looks like handhelds. Like I really, truly earnestly believe

181
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:40,545
Speaker 4:  that in a way that I did not when I started this process. I

182
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:42,745
Speaker 5:  Already have so many questions. I'm excited

183
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:47,225
Speaker 4:  I have what I have developed into David's five grand theories of handheld

184
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:50,665
Speaker 4:  gaming's, supremacy and victory. That's the, that's the official technical

185
00:11:50,665 --> 00:11:51,185
Speaker 4:  term. Sure,

186
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:51,465
Speaker 5:  Sure,

187
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:54,445
Speaker 4:  Sure. The first thing I realized in talking to folks about this and going

188
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:58,005
Speaker 4:  back and doing a bunch of research, I spent a lot of time watching like 20

189
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:01,885
Speaker 4:  year old game console introductions like

190
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:05,405
Speaker 4:  E three, 2004, all kinds of good stuff going on at E three

191
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:09,205
Speaker 4:  2004. And I think, I think I didn't realize is that this

192
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:12,885
Speaker 4:  is kind of what the gaming industry has always wanted.

193
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:17,125
Speaker 4:  Like there was stuff from the PSP and the early days

194
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,765
Speaker 4:  of the DSS that it's like Nintendo and Sony and a lot of these gaming

195
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:24,045
Speaker 4:  companies have been talking about this idea that you should have something

196
00:12:24,235 --> 00:12:28,205
Speaker 4:  that is powerful and feels like a console but is not tied to

197
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,925
Speaker 4:  your television in your couch. Like they've been talking about this forever

198
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:33,525
Speaker 4:  in a way that I really did not realize.

199
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:37,925
Speaker 5:  You know what's funny about that, I swear that when I

200
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:41,685
Speaker 5:  went to the very first PlayStation Vita Press event, they

201
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:45,005
Speaker 5:  showed us a build of the PlayStation Vita with an

202
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:49,085
Speaker 5:  HDMI out on it. The original premise was like you would be

203
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:52,925
Speaker 5:  able to actually plug it into your tv and that just got erased from

204
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:56,805
Speaker 5:  time. I don't even know if I can find this anymore, but I am positive

205
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,805
Speaker 5:  that I remember this and now that you say this that like, yes, this

206
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:04,605
Speaker 5:  has been a dream for a long time, this kind of blurring in the lines makes

207
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:05,125
Speaker 5:  a lot of sense.

208
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:09,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This stuff is so much less new than I expected. And I will say

209
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:13,205
Speaker 4:  to some extent it kind of gives me pause because like if you rewind

210
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:16,805
Speaker 4:  back to 2004, all these people were launching these devices saying

211
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:21,325
Speaker 4:  this is the moment for handheld gaming and that, nope, it

212
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:22,245
Speaker 4:  wasn't. But it,

213
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:26,045
Speaker 6:  It was in the sense that like the DSS sold like gobs and gobs of units.

214
00:13:26,045 --> 00:13:28,245
Speaker 6:  Right? But totally like not on the console side.

215
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:31,405
Speaker 4:  So this is actually what I was gonna ask you guys is there was this moment,

216
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:35,085
Speaker 4:  right? We had the dss, the PSP, there was this real

217
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:39,405
Speaker 4:  energy around consoles you could hold in your hand and then they

218
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:42,165
Speaker 4:  just died. And you guys have been paying attention to this a lot longer than

219
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:45,565
Speaker 4:  I have. Like what happened to that generation of handheld gaming?

220
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:49,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think it ran through the three dss. You, you had the

221
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,205
Speaker 6:  DSS and the three dss which were, which both did quite well. Incredibly well.

222
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:57,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But on the like high-end handheld gaming side, the both the

223
00:13:57,355 --> 00:14:01,325
Speaker 6:  Vida and the PSPI think just struggled to like reach

224
00:14:01,485 --> 00:14:04,125
Speaker 6:  a wider audience for whatever reason. Maybe it was 'cause they were going

225
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:08,045
Speaker 6:  for like more mature games or something like that. There just

226
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:11,445
Speaker 6:  wasn't, I, I don't know the, maybe the hardware wasn't ready to the point

227
00:14:11,445 --> 00:14:15,285
Speaker 6:  where people w wanted to make discreet software for those

228
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:18,525
Speaker 6:  platforms. Whereas Nintendo was like, whatever our games will run on anything,

229
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,045
Speaker 6:  we can make it happen. I

230
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:23,965
Speaker 5:  Agree with fresh. I think it definitely is partly that Nintendo is always

231
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:27,845
Speaker 5:  fine selling effectively like graphing calculators and making

232
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:31,765
Speaker 5:  cash off of it, right? That was the original model of the game. Boy You know

233
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:35,005
Speaker 5:  what you're saying of this has been a long time coming that maybe

234
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,805
Speaker 5:  smartphones threw a wrench in it temporarily. I think

235
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:39,125
Speaker 4:  That's right.

236
00:14:39,465 --> 00:14:43,165
Speaker 5:  And that we did have this period of, well maybe mobile

237
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:47,085
Speaker 5:  gaming is just Farmville, right? Maybe it's, it's

238
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:50,885
Speaker 5:  these idle games. I mean I remember Fresh,

239
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:54,845
Speaker 5:  I think we were at this together at a game developers' conference where

240
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:59,045
Speaker 5:  I think it was RO from Nintendo went on stage and

241
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:02,765
Speaker 5:  was like, can people please stop making 99 cent games?

242
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:06,365
Speaker 5:  Like this actually is not good for the industry. And at the time

243
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:10,685
Speaker 5:  everybody was like, ugh, You know. Like here's Nintendo, the old

244
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:14,845
Speaker 5:  industry coming into the room telling us not to do this anymore. But in hindsight

245
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:17,965
Speaker 5:  that kind of proved right in some ways.

246
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:22,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think free to play ended up taking over that model. But yeah,

247
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:26,005
Speaker 6:  100% it does diminish I think the higher end products and

248
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,925
Speaker 6:  results in games that are designed for that cheap price point to get even

249
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:30,885
Speaker 6:  more money out of people.

250
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:34,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think that's right. I think there, there's a really interesting version

251
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:37,885
Speaker 4:  of this story where you could argue that mobile was kind of the great

252
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:41,245
Speaker 4:  diversion for the gaming industry for a really long time and it led a lot

253
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:45,005
Speaker 4:  of people down really profitable, really unpleasant roads that ultimately

254
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:48,965
Speaker 4:  led to nothing. And like we got to Farmville and whatever that was. And

255
00:15:49,045 --> 00:15:52,405
Speaker 4:  I mean even the Sony story, right? They got obsessed with the Xperia phones

256
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:55,005
Speaker 4:  and trying to build gaming phones and then just trying to build regular phones

257
00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:58,925
Speaker 4:  and kind of got away from what it was doing really well before that.

258
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:02,405
Speaker 4:  So I. Yeah, I, I think you guys are right that some combination of the hardware

259
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:06,285
Speaker 4:  wasn't quite ready and mobile was just sort of ate

260
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:09,485
Speaker 4:  that thing. Which brings me to theory number one, which is that the hardware

261
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:13,445
Speaker 4:  is ready now. Oh yeah. Which is a huge, huge change. Like I

262
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:16,885
Speaker 4:  went back and looked at the, the specs for like the PSS four when it came

263
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:18,805
Speaker 4:  out. Do you guys remember everybody was talking about it as if it was like

264
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:22,005
Speaker 4:  a supercomputer. It was like this is the most powerful, that thing is basically

265
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:25,765
Speaker 4:  specs like a like mid-level laptop. Like yeah, that's, we can do

266
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,885
Speaker 4:  powerful gaming systems now without trying all that hard. The chips are super

267
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:33,445
Speaker 4:  accessible. You have more and more of these really powerful chips that are

268
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:37,005
Speaker 4:  being built with mobile in mind. They care more about battery life. They're

269
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:40,525
Speaker 4:  much more efficient, they're much cheaper to get, like it's there now in

270
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:44,045
Speaker 4:  a way that it wasn't. And you can build really good games for these platforms

271
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:47,965
Speaker 4:  in a way that you couldn't before, which I think is a huge, huge change.

272
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:50,965
Speaker 4:  And it's just like, it, it's just sitting there now like you can now make

273
00:16:50,965 --> 00:16:51,885
Speaker 4:  these if you want to.

274
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:56,005
Speaker 6:  And I think the, the fact that people are making games that run on

275
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:59,605
Speaker 6:  not only the handheld system but also the console system and it's the same

276
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:03,605
Speaker 6:  game. They haven't changed one iota. The fact that I can play Elden ring

277
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:07,885
Speaker 6:  on the steam deck and also on my PS four Yeah. And also on my PS

278
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:11,485
Speaker 6:  five makes a huge, huge difference from just like a bandwidth

279
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:14,565
Speaker 6:  standpoint. There's only so many games that everyone can produce, let alone

280
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:17,925
Speaker 6:  games. They're discreetly made for each individual platform.

281
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:19,965
Speaker 6:  So yeah, it, it's a big change.

282
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:22,885
Speaker 4:  I think that's actually exactly right. And that's one of the things I only

283
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:25,845
Speaker 4:  realized in talking to folks about this that I had never really realized

284
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,685
Speaker 4:  before is there was this obsession for so long with like there were console

285
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:32,925
Speaker 4:  games and then there were Handheld games and they were different. And that

286
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:36,725
Speaker 4:  the way to make these systems work was to build like specific games

287
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:40,805
Speaker 4:  for these devices and they had to be their own genre. So when

288
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:43,485
Speaker 4:  anybody stopped doing it because they didn't sell really fast immediately

289
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:47,005
Speaker 4:  or whatever, they just died. Right? It's this like death spiral of nobody

290
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,725
Speaker 4:  caress that leads to these platforms dying now it's not the case. And this

291
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:53,725
Speaker 4:  is actually you, you stole David Grand theory number four from me.

292
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:54,845
Speaker 6:  Oh man. Sorry.

293
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:58,685
Speaker 4:  It's fine. We're just, we're jumping around here. Theory number four is parody.

294
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:02,245
Speaker 4:  It's that you can just build a game now and It works everywhere. I found

295
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:05,205
Speaker 4:  myself talking to a bunch of people who have been building games like this

296
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:08,765
Speaker 4:  for a long time. You like, you look at a company like ea, right? EA makes

297
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:12,725
Speaker 4:  console games and it makes mobile games with the same names but

298
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:16,565
Speaker 4:  that are fundamentally totally different games. And that barrier

299
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:20,645
Speaker 4:  is sort of collapsing, right? Where like Fortnite and Roblox

300
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:23,885
Speaker 4:  are functionally the same thing no matter what screen you play on. And it

301
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:27,365
Speaker 4:  seems to me that that is much more the future than

302
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:31,845
Speaker 4:  tailoring everything to this specific device and controls and console that

303
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:32,885
Speaker 4:  you're on. Do you guys think that's right?

304
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:36,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Not only is that better for the players, that's also from a

305
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:40,765
Speaker 6:  business standpoint way more cost productive. So there's really no reason

306
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:44,565
Speaker 6:  that you would ever need if you needed to. I just think people

307
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:48,525
Speaker 6:  are gonna gravitate towards just making a A game that'll work on just about

308
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:48,885
Speaker 6:  everything.

309
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,685
Speaker 4:  Chris, you made a face like you might hate this idea.

310
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:55,005
Speaker 5:  No, I like this a lot. I think there's like one other piece to all of this

311
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:59,005
Speaker 5:  in this separation between mobile and console, which

312
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:02,805
Speaker 5:  is gender misconceptions in the history of video games. Hmm.

313
00:19:03,445 --> 00:19:07,365
Speaker 5:  I think that not only were there these two different types of games, I

314
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:11,125
Speaker 5:  think people saw people who play mobile games as women

315
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:15,085
Speaker 5:  or people who are on Facebook as quote You know mom gamers

316
00:19:15,505 --> 00:19:19,125
Speaker 5:  and that hardcore counsel gamers were men And. what I

317
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:23,085
Speaker 5:  think marketers are realizing slowly and hopefully

318
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:26,645
Speaker 5:  exponentially is that not only is that not true, it it's never

319
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:30,565
Speaker 5:  been true. And once you blow that thought up, then that is

320
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:33,965
Speaker 5:  when the games that were on mobile, the like kind of like casual games

321
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:37,885
Speaker 5:  actually just show up on Xbox You know because why not? Why shouldn't they

322
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,365
Speaker 5:  be there? There's an audience for them there And that's when Call of Duty

323
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,325
Speaker 5:  shows up on your iPhone that these are not discrete places. I I,

324
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:49,205
Speaker 5:  I remember an event back in the DS days where Nintendo

325
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:52,845
Speaker 5:  had brain age or something and they threw like high tea for it.

326
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:53,565
Speaker 4:  Nice,

327
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:57,005
Speaker 5:  Nice. But like they were, they were very transparent. Like who they thought

328
00:19:57,305 --> 00:20:01,285
Speaker 5:  was Yeah. The audience for this game and who they thought wasn't and

329
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,325
Speaker 5:  when in reality everybody liked Brain age.

330
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:07,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Do that for Call of Duty next time. That's the hell yeah. Give me high

331
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,125
Speaker 4:  tea for Call of Duty and we'll we'll be somewhere. No, I think that's right

332
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,565
Speaker 4:  And I think the overall collapse of gaming

333
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:17,885
Speaker 4:  into just being across everything is kind of the

334
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:21,325
Speaker 4:  thing that underscores all of this for me, right? Is that we're now to a

335
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:25,005
Speaker 4:  place where gaming was once a specific thing you did on a

336
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:28,845
Speaker 4:  specific device in a specific place. Mm. And it has just ballooned out to

337
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:32,485
Speaker 4:  being worlds that you dip in and out of no matter where you are. And it feels

338
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:35,925
Speaker 4:  like with that comes working on lots of different platforms, lots of different

339
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:38,685
Speaker 4:  kinds of hardware. Like it's the same thing that's happening with computers,

340
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:42,325
Speaker 4:  right? It's that instead of being a thing in a room that you sit down at

341
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:46,325
Speaker 4:  to do a thing, it's just like woven into your life in these new

342
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:49,050
Speaker 4:  ways. And that's what the, the game developers want. Increasingly it seems

343
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:52,165
Speaker 4:  that's where the money is. That's how you get people to be involved. That's

344
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:55,285
Speaker 4:  where like the online communities are moving. So it makes sense to me that

345
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:59,085
Speaker 4:  all of this stuff is just sort of 10 tickling out into everything with a

346
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:00,005
Speaker 4:  screen and a chip in it.

347
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:03,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I don't think this is, it's solely just a realization that

348
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:07,885
Speaker 6:  yeah the mar the audiences are more or less the same across everywhere.

349
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:11,925
Speaker 6:  It's also just a hardware consideration that like you could not

350
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:15,885
Speaker 6:  have a handheld that could run a console game 10, 15 years ago. We just Yeah.

351
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:19,045
Speaker 6:  Like physically, right? The hardware was not gonna handle it. So the fact

352
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:22,885
Speaker 6:  that we've caught up and also the fact that we've diminished the importance

353
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:26,685
Speaker 6:  of console generations is a huge impact on this as well. The fact that

354
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:30,245
Speaker 6:  there are so few PS five exclusive games or

355
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:34,325
Speaker 6:  Xbox Series X exclusive games means that you're making

356
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:37,645
Speaker 6:  games that run on all these different generations, which include

357
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:41,605
Speaker 6:  handheld games at this point. So e, everything is sort of working together

358
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:42,765
Speaker 6:  to kind of get us there.

359
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:46,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I was listening back to old interviews with Reggie Fme

360
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:50,725
Speaker 4:  from Nintendo and he was talking about one of the

361
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:54,885
Speaker 4:  challenges for the gaming industry is thinking about like the 10 year horizon

362
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:58,085
Speaker 4:  of every console generation that it's like anything we do we have to be able

363
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:02,005
Speaker 4:  to live with for a decade because that's how this works and we

364
00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:05,885
Speaker 4:  are just not in that world anymore. Everything overlaps, things are

365
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:08,605
Speaker 4:  moving, especially with You know cloud and sort of this move to digital.

366
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:12,485
Speaker 4:  It just feels like all of the ideas about what you can run and where

367
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:15,845
Speaker 4:  and how long you have to support things, that's all just rapidly going out

368
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:16,565
Speaker 4:  the window. It seems like

369
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:20,325
Speaker 6:  What's really exciting is your library stays with you. Like Steam obviously

370
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:24,085
Speaker 6:  has had a consistent library. God willing, Nintendo is finally gonna

371
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:27,605
Speaker 6:  like You know they've promised that they're gonna continue the library

372
00:22:27,865 --> 00:22:31,685
Speaker 6:  for the first time ever on whatever the switch followup is. So I think

373
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,205
Speaker 6:  that is a big pusher as well.

374
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:36,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think that's the funny part that you mentioned Reggie, because we

375
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:40,925
Speaker 5:  still don't know if Nintendo is on board with this. We've

376
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:44,845
Speaker 5:  heard a lot of promises but until the switch to is out,

377
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:49,165
Speaker 5:  I would never bet against Nintendo doing something deeply strange

378
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:53,285
Speaker 4:  If they call it the switch to and don't let you keep your library that is

379
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:56,245
Speaker 4:  the most like outrageous user hostile thing imaginable.

380
00:22:56,555 --> 00:23:00,165
Speaker 5:  Also they need to call it the Super Switch. Oh that's good. In the same way

381
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:03,285
Speaker 5:  that they should have called the we the super we instead of the we you just

382
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:05,685
Speaker 5:  like go back to that classic Nintendo convention.

383
00:23:06,325 --> 00:23:08,325
Speaker 4:  I was so with you until you said super we

384
00:23:08,535 --> 00:23:09,165
Speaker 5:  Super we.

385
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:12,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no I I think you guys are right And I think that idea is part of what

386
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:15,365
Speaker 4:  makes me think that handheld is the thing. Because I think if you were to

387
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:18,085
Speaker 4:  boil it all the way down to something and it's like what is the single most

388
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:22,205
Speaker 4:  versatile version of the hardware here? It's a handheld object

389
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:25,965
Speaker 4:  which I think is like why we start from there going forward. Which brings

390
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:29,565
Speaker 4:  me to thing number, I don't know two, I've lost track. We're just,

391
00:23:29,565 --> 00:23:33,045
Speaker 4:  there's some theories it doesn't matter which is just, it's somewhere between

392
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:37,285
Speaker 4:  like manufacturing and momentum. I couldn't decide which MI wanted to

393
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:41,205
Speaker 4:  do but there has been like an explosion of this hardware over the last

394
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:45,005
Speaker 4:  couple of years in a way that I didn't even realize. Like I'm, I own a switch,

395
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:48,525
Speaker 4:  I have played some steam deck and I was kind of like there's those two and

396
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:52,365
Speaker 4:  then nothing else of real great consequence and like good lord was I

397
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:56,125
Speaker 4:  wrong? There's so much stuff out there and you have like the

398
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:59,205
Speaker 4:  PC manufacturers are getting super into this because you can, it's essentially

399
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:03,165
Speaker 4:  just a like relatively high powered PC in a slightly different case.

400
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,805
Speaker 4:  You have all of these new companies like Analog coming outta the woodwork

401
00:24:06,805 --> 00:24:10,765
Speaker 4:  to do some of this stuff. You have gaming companies like Razor and Logitech

402
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:14,565
Speaker 4:  doing all this stuff. It's like this feels like a hardware category

403
00:24:14,565 --> 00:24:18,245
Speaker 4:  that a lot of folks can get into in really interesting ways, which makes

404
00:24:18,245 --> 00:24:21,805
Speaker 4:  me think it's gonna get much bigger than just the like game

405
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:25,565
Speaker 4:  maker companies really, really fast. And it feels like that momentum is already

406
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:26,365
Speaker 4:  happening. Yeah,

407
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:30,205
Speaker 6:  I completely agree. I mean we You know, we haven't even dove into the like

408
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:34,565
Speaker 6:  random flyby night handheld developers companies that

409
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:38,485
Speaker 6:  you might see on like Amazon or whatever. But yeah, the fact that as and

410
00:24:38,665 --> 00:24:42,445
Speaker 6:  Lenovo and as you mentioned Razor and Logitech,

411
00:24:42,745 --> 00:24:46,605
Speaker 6:  the fact that they are going hard on this and so quickly after seeing

412
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:50,565
Speaker 6:  the success of the Steam deck is really just I think a huge

413
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:54,685
Speaker 6:  indicator of where things are going. I also think it's, they have the luxury

414
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:58,725
Speaker 6:  of being able to sell older chips in these devices that aren't like

415
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:02,845
Speaker 6:  cutting bleeding edge chips because they need to keep the power usage

416
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:06,765
Speaker 6:  down so they can use stuff that's like maybe one or two years

417
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:10,205
Speaker 6:  old, which is really the the model that the switch set out, right? Like the

418
00:25:10,205 --> 00:25:13,965
Speaker 6:  Switch was not a blazingly powerful system when it launched and it

419
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:17,765
Speaker 6:  allowed Nintendo to sell it at a profit. And I think you're gonna see a lot

420
00:25:17,765 --> 00:25:21,205
Speaker 6:  of companies these days sell these things at a good profit,

421
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:25,045
Speaker 6:  not steam deck. I, my understanding is they lose some money there but they

422
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:27,325
Speaker 6:  also own the library. So it comes back around

423
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:31,125
Speaker 4:  Actually tell me about all of the ones that you find on Amazon. 'cause I

424
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:34,645
Speaker 4:  have been looking into all of these and it, it kind of reminds me of like

425
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:39,205
Speaker 4:  the smartphone market of say seven or eight years ago. Yeah. When

426
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,365
Speaker 4:  it was, it was very clear that now there's like the parts for this exist

427
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:45,485
Speaker 4:  in factories in China, right? And if you want to go buy some of those parts

428
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:48,685
Speaker 4:  you can make a phone without trying super hard. And so there was just this

429
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,965
Speaker 4:  rush of companies you've never heard of making phones that all had the exact

430
00:25:51,965 --> 00:25:54,325
Speaker 4:  same specs because those are the ones you can buy from the factory in China.

431
00:25:55,065 --> 00:25:58,045
Speaker 4:  It feels like that's the phase of handheld gaming we're in right now where

432
00:25:58,045 --> 00:26:01,805
Speaker 4:  like there are 600 slightly hard to pronounce

433
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:05,205
Speaker 4:  versions of what look like about the exact same thing all over Amazon. Are

434
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:05,605
Speaker 4:  they any good?

435
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:09,445
Speaker 5:  Are you a pow kitty man or a a Brunick boy

436
00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:10,765
Speaker 5:  You know,

437
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:13,525
Speaker 4:  I feel like I can't legally answer that question.

438
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:18,045
Speaker 6:  Those are a few of the bigger ones if you can believe it. Yeah, Anick is

439
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:21,365
Speaker 6:  one of the biggest of these companies that is making these devices

440
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:25,885
Speaker 6:  and I think what's so interesting about these is unlike I

441
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:29,045
Speaker 6:  think a lot of those phones that you're talking about, these are mostly

442
00:26:29,315 --> 00:26:33,285
Speaker 6:  supported by software that the community is developing and

443
00:26:33,285 --> 00:26:37,005
Speaker 6:  working on. A lot of them are Linux based or Android based, but in terms

444
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:40,925
Speaker 6:  of the actual interfaces and the firmware, a lot of

445
00:26:40,925 --> 00:26:44,565
Speaker 6:  communities are kind of rallying around specific devices. I know the MIU

446
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:48,525
Speaker 6:  Mini in particular is a very popular iteration and folks

447
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:52,405
Speaker 6:  just sort of make open source software to run on these devices. So it

448
00:26:52,405 --> 00:26:55,005
Speaker 6:  is this like really exciting community event that's happening.

449
00:26:55,475 --> 00:26:58,765
Speaker 5:  It's also created a cottage industry around it because

450
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:03,245
Speaker 5:  not everybody likes setting up devices and installing custom

451
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:07,125
Speaker 5:  firmware. So I'm sure if you happen to look on Etsy

452
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:11,405
Speaker 5:  you might find versions of these exact same things that have been just

453
00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:15,445
Speaker 5:  slightly tinkered with and maybe they include all of the

454
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:19,045
Speaker 5:  emulators or all of the software that Brush is talking about

455
00:27:19,735 --> 00:27:23,365
Speaker 5:  along with maybe some other stuff that's not so legal or

456
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:27,165
Speaker 6:  Perhaps a more legit approach. 'cause we do legal things on this podcast.

457
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:27,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

458
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

459
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:32,005
Speaker 6:  I would recommend there's some great YouTube channels that like specifically

460
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:36,165
Speaker 6:  dedicate themselves to this group of handhelds. Retro game core

461
00:27:36,345 --> 00:27:40,165
Speaker 6:  is an excellent one that I'd highly recommend, but there are a number

462
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:44,165
Speaker 6:  that do a really good job of covering this space and giving people instructions

463
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:46,805
Speaker 6:  on how to like do some of this heavy lifting in the firmware.

464
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:50,765
Speaker 4:  Chris, did you say Etsy by the way? This is an Etsy phenomenon. Yeah.

465
00:27:50,765 --> 00:27:53,885
Speaker 4:  They're not sending you like knitted covers for them. They're actually like

466
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:56,525
Speaker 4:  they're, that's you. But you get Linux, Etsy

467
00:27:56,785 --> 00:28:00,365
Speaker 5:  Is so much bigger and weirder than anybody

468
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:04,365
Speaker 5:  imagines it it, it reminds me of Pinterest too where people are

469
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:07,605
Speaker 5:  like, I think I know what that is and then you like realize half of Pinterest

470
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,485
Speaker 5:  is people with guns and you're like wait, what?

471
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:13,645
Speaker 6:  I will say I looked at list things on Etsy for replacement

472
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:17,565
Speaker 6:  triggers for the Miu Min handheld that I use and someone

473
00:28:17,705 --> 00:28:21,365
Speaker 6:  had three D printed a new design for the triggers.

474
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:24,405
Speaker 6:  That's how esoteric it gets on there. It's pretty amazing.

475
00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:28,485
Speaker 4:  That's awesome. Okay. Yeah. Who knew Etsy not just

476
00:28:28,585 --> 00:28:32,485
Speaker 4:  for buying coffee tables that barely work in my house. Okay, my

477
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:36,005
Speaker 4:  next theory, and this is one I am torn about

478
00:28:36,235 --> 00:28:40,045
Speaker 4:  more than any of the others, which is that the handheld gaming revolution

479
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:43,845
Speaker 4:  is also the cloud gaming revolution and

480
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:48,485
Speaker 4:  I remain torn on whether I believe cloud gaming is like

481
00:28:48,585 --> 00:28:52,445
Speaker 4:  the future or not and I'm very curious to know what you guys

482
00:28:52,645 --> 00:28:53,165
Speaker 4:  think about this.

483
00:28:54,205 --> 00:28:58,005
Speaker 5:  I think you could be right if handheld gaming

484
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:02,325
Speaker 5:  continues to look how it does right now, which is to say you get a

485
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:05,685
Speaker 5:  steam deck and you can play 90,

486
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:09,125
Speaker 5:  95% of what you want on that device.

487
00:29:09,745 --> 00:29:13,605
Speaker 5:  But the brand new stuff, the real cutting edge heavy

488
00:29:13,745 --> 00:29:17,685
Speaker 5:  ray tracing stuff like Allen Wake two, that's

489
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:21,205
Speaker 5:  not gonna work on it. That you're still gonna need a really nice PC or a

490
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:25,325
Speaker 5:  PSS five to make that work in those games if you must play them

491
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:29,045
Speaker 5:  now and you don't wanna buy that if you can play that on cloud.

492
00:29:29,965 --> 00:29:33,805
Speaker 5:  I think that's it. But I think cloud for the foreseeable

493
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,645
Speaker 5:  future and I'm curious what Fresh thinks here, but I think cloud is a

494
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:41,965
Speaker 5:  nice to have. It is a supplement to most of

495
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:44,725
Speaker 5:  your stuff being powered by the actual hardware itself.

496
00:29:44,955 --> 00:29:47,765
Speaker 4:  Wait, that's really interesting. So fresh. I am curious what you think too

497
00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:50,645
Speaker 4:  but Chris you just said the opposite of the argument that I hear from most

498
00:29:50,645 --> 00:29:54,285
Speaker 4:  people, which is that like most people when I talk to them about cloud gaming,

499
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:58,125
Speaker 4:  they're like well the, the people who play the most intense games and

500
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:01,525
Speaker 4:  worry the most about things like controller lag, like

501
00:30:01,905 --> 00:30:05,845
Speaker 4:  the people who go on our battle stations for fun, like those people, those

502
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,485
Speaker 4:  people are never gonna want cloud gaming because they want something that

503
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:11,885
Speaker 4:  is local, that is theirs, that is offline like that with the minimal lag

504
00:30:11,885 --> 00:30:15,845
Speaker 4:  and their wired mouse and all that stuff. But for the more like casual

505
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,805
Speaker 4:  user cloud gaming is the answer. But you just kind of said the opposite.

506
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:24,325
Speaker 6:  No I think plant agrees with you because I think the more casual user isn't

507
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:27,925
Speaker 6:  gonna have the hardware that can run Allen Wake two with Ray tracing and

508
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:31,405
Speaker 6:  everything but they wanna play the game 'cause it's a great narrative experience,

509
00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:35,405
Speaker 6:  whatever. So this is the solution. The hardcore, they have

510
00:30:35,665 --> 00:30:39,525
Speaker 6:  the 40 90 card, they have the hardware to run those games so they

511
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:43,485
Speaker 6:  don't need to worry about it. It is the people that like don't wanna bother

512
00:30:44,285 --> 00:30:45,605
Speaker 6:  getting that system together.

513
00:30:45,975 --> 00:30:49,885
Speaker 5:  David, I think what is changing is what the idea of the casual user

514
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:53,445
Speaker 5:  is. Hmm. Somebody who plays PC games just in general

515
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:57,885
Speaker 5:  that can be the casual user now, right? Yeah. So like I think

516
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:02,325
Speaker 5:  somebody having this steam deck who's like yeah playing some pretty hardcore

517
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:06,085
Speaker 5:  stuff. What would be hardcore in our childhood now is just

518
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:09,845
Speaker 5:  somebody who's used to watching these people stream since the day they were

519
00:31:09,845 --> 00:31:10,405
Speaker 5:  five. Yeah.

520
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:14,525
Speaker 6:  To go back to like whether I think it's there yet, I think it's actually

521
00:31:14,565 --> 00:31:18,365
Speaker 6:  surprisingly close, but there is an element of like the closer you get, the

522
00:31:18,365 --> 00:31:22,085
Speaker 6:  further it feels away. Yeah. Because there is still lag, there are still

523
00:31:22,205 --> 00:31:26,045
Speaker 6:  dropouts and if anyone like cares about playing a platforming game or a

524
00:31:26,045 --> 00:31:29,645
Speaker 6:  shooter or anything that revolves around timing, it just doesn't

525
00:31:29,835 --> 00:31:33,645
Speaker 6:  feel as good as playing a locally installed game.

526
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:37,485
Speaker 6:  All these Nintendo games that are made within an inch of their lives to feel

527
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:40,685
Speaker 6:  awesome every second of the way can never

528
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:44,005
Speaker 6:  necessarily get there. At least with the where, where the systems are at

529
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:47,845
Speaker 6:  right now with cloud. 'cause there will always be a slightly tactile

530
00:31:48,095 --> 00:31:52,045
Speaker 6:  delay there that will make it feel a little worse. But I

531
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:55,845
Speaker 6:  do think knowing technology that it can get there

532
00:31:55,945 --> 00:31:59,685
Speaker 6:  to the point where the delay will be so small as to be

533
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:03,125
Speaker 6:  indistinguishable from playing a game locally in the same way that like I

534
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:06,565
Speaker 6:  play with wireless controllers all the time. An eSports person

535
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:10,845
Speaker 6:  can't stand playing with wireless controllers 'cause they feel that 10 millisecond

536
00:32:10,935 --> 00:32:14,365
Speaker 6:  delay. But like I think for most people it's totally fine. I think we will

537
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:15,485
Speaker 6:  get to that point with cloud gaming.

538
00:32:15,845 --> 00:32:18,645
Speaker 5:  I agree and I agree that it feels like we're very close but it might still

539
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,885
Speaker 5:  be a long time until we get there in the same way that it felt like we would

540
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:25,805
Speaker 5:  never cross the uncanny valley in video games. Hmm. Until we just

541
00:32:25,865 --> 00:32:29,685
Speaker 5:  did one day and there was a good decade. We're like

542
00:32:29,685 --> 00:32:33,125
Speaker 5:  we're never gonna get this right. Like human eyes are just gonna look awful.

543
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:37,245
Speaker 5:  Faces are always gonna look weird. It's going to be uncomfortable

544
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:41,205
Speaker 5:  looking at characters and video games and then suddenly the

545
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:44,685
Speaker 5:  US weren't talking about that anymore. You know, I mean unless it was a Bethesda

546
00:32:44,685 --> 00:32:48,285
Speaker 5:  game but otherwise you you were like yeah it just looks

547
00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:52,365
Speaker 5:  nice and good. I sure why not. I think that'll happen with cloud gaming and

548
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:56,165
Speaker 5:  that's again why I say it'll start out supplemental and then at some

549
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:57,925
Speaker 5:  point it'll just be second nature.

550
00:32:58,315 --> 00:33:01,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean right now it is supplemental. You can play whatever Catan

551
00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:05,965
Speaker 6:  or any turn based strategy game and it's perfectly fine. Like I've

552
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:09,725
Speaker 6:  played games like that, it's great. But yeah, anything with timing is

553
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:10,845
Speaker 6:  kind of miserable.

554
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:14,725
Speaker 4:  Do you think that's tied to handhelds as a thing? 'cause I think that the

555
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:18,565
Speaker 4:  case for those two things growing together is essentially that

556
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:22,725
Speaker 4:  over time you wouldn't need something that looks and feels like

557
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:26,685
Speaker 4:  the steam deck, which is, I mean it's, it is a big thing. You could

558
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:29,645
Speaker 4:  essentially just have anything with a screen and two controllers becomes

559
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:32,005
Speaker 4:  this like ultra powerful gaming machine. I mean

560
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:35,965
Speaker 6:  Logitech made a dedicated cloud handheld, right? That is their

561
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:38,765
Speaker 6:  entire focus with that device, right? That is cloud gaming.

562
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:41,005
Speaker 4:  I have to say I don't see a ton of those things in the wild

563
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:44,805
Speaker 6:  Well, right, and the problem is again, the cloud gaming our infrastructure

564
00:33:44,985 --> 00:33:48,445
Speaker 6:  is not there yet. Right. So people don't necessarily want that yet. I do

565
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:51,565
Speaker 6:  think you're right. In a few years when the lag becomes minimal

566
00:33:52,385 --> 00:33:56,245
Speaker 6:  you can run it on a $50 hand. Like the fact that you could run two

567
00:33:56,625 --> 00:34:00,245
Speaker 6:  on a $50 Handheld gaming system is possible

568
00:34:00,265 --> 00:34:02,365
Speaker 6:  thanks to cloud gaming. We're just not there yet.

569
00:34:02,765 --> 00:34:06,445
Speaker 5:  I do wonder if ironically power is getting so cheap,

570
00:34:06,965 --> 00:34:10,725
Speaker 5:  a lot of the games that people play don't even use that much power that

571
00:34:10,745 --> 00:34:14,325
Speaker 5:  we are getting to a point where maybe You know

572
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,965
Speaker 5:  a few years from now Steam or valve releases a

573
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:21,925
Speaker 5:  $150 steam deck that has

574
00:34:22,405 --> 00:34:25,925
Speaker 5:  internal power and can still play the vast majority of what you want.

575
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:30,525
Speaker 5:  And like by the time we actually get to You know cloud gaming

576
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:33,285
Speaker 5:  working, we actually won't need cloud gaming.

577
00:34:33,555 --> 00:34:37,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean like our phones do ray tracing now. Like it's we're we're getting

578
00:34:37,405 --> 00:34:38,845
Speaker 4:  there really fast. Yeah. Yeah.

579
00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:42,925
Speaker 5:  I'd much rather play Resin Evil four remake just directly on

580
00:34:42,945 --> 00:34:46,765
Speaker 5:  my phone than I've tried playing Resin Evil four. Oh my gosh. I played

581
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:50,645
Speaker 5:  all of Resin Evil Village on Stadia. I was the person

582
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:55,125
Speaker 5:  AMA and let me tell you it was,

583
00:34:55,785 --> 00:34:59,165
Speaker 5:  it was a journey. I'm very happy to never do that again.

584
00:34:59,595 --> 00:34:59,885
Speaker 5:  They

585
00:34:59,885 --> 00:35:03,125
Speaker 4:  Were like, why is anyone still using our services and it's just Chris Plant

586
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:04,685
Speaker 4:  throwing his controller at the screen.

587
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:07,965
Speaker 5:  They saw that final achievement on lock and they, they're like, wait, what?

588
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:09,765
Speaker 5:  Somebody on the IP must be doing it.

589
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:13,525
Speaker 4:  No. Okay. I think you're right and I think that also dovetails into

590
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:17,885
Speaker 4:  my next theory, which is about app stores. One person I talked to

591
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:21,725
Speaker 4:  made the case to me that Apple and Google could have

592
00:35:21,835 --> 00:35:25,805
Speaker 4:  essentially won the next generation of gaming in a, they,

593
00:35:25,805 --> 00:35:29,205
Speaker 4:  they won like part of that generation of gaming but because of the way that

594
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:32,805
Speaker 4:  they governed their app stores making companies

595
00:35:32,995 --> 00:35:36,965
Speaker 4:  that wanted to have game libraries like You know allow list each game and

596
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:40,845
Speaker 4:  list each game separately and pay this huge tax on a difficult margin business

597
00:35:40,845 --> 00:35:44,725
Speaker 4:  to be in with that, not only did those companies prevent themselves from

598
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:48,245
Speaker 4:  being hugely powerful players in the gaming industry, they

599
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:52,205
Speaker 4:  actually inspired this whole new run of hardware because

600
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:55,805
Speaker 4:  instead of set, instead of saying we're gonna build great games for

601
00:35:56,185 --> 00:35:59,325
Speaker 4:  the very powerful mobile device you already have, they're saying we have

602
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:03,005
Speaker 4:  to build a new kind of device to play this kind of game because

603
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:06,925
Speaker 4:  we can't literally afford to play by the app store rules.

604
00:36:07,105 --> 00:36:11,005
Speaker 4:  And I find that fascinating and I kind of think it's true that I think

605
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:14,325
Speaker 4:  a lot of these companies are showing up saying rather than

606
00:36:15,075 --> 00:36:19,005
Speaker 4:  just try to compete with all of the amazing games that are already

607
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:22,965
Speaker 4:  on your phone, we're out here saying we, we can give you games that you can't

608
00:36:22,965 --> 00:36:26,765
Speaker 4:  otherwise get. And that becomes very compelling in a way that it

609
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:29,405
Speaker 4:  wouldn't have been if all that stuff was just in the play store or the app

610
00:36:29,405 --> 00:36:30,365
Speaker 4:  store. Yeah, it's

611
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:34,165
Speaker 6:  Tricky because there are a lot of the reason why a lot of those games

612
00:36:34,265 --> 00:36:37,405
Speaker 6:  didn't show up on those platforms. You're right, there's like a huge cut

613
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:41,285
Speaker 6:  that they're taking. But I also think there were hardware limitations. You

614
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:45,085
Speaker 6:  couldn't run Resident Evil two remake on a phone when that

615
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:47,885
Speaker 6:  game came out three or four years ago. Yeah, that's fair. So I think that

616
00:36:47,885 --> 00:36:50,605
Speaker 6:  that is part of it. But you're right, I think there's also an element of

617
00:36:50,885 --> 00:36:54,525
Speaker 6:  like it being a pretty big lift, whether it's a rev share

618
00:36:54,785 --> 00:36:58,765
Speaker 6:  or just a development lift to get devices to get software onto

619
00:36:58,765 --> 00:37:02,405
Speaker 6:  those devices that is diminishing over time.

620
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:06,765
Speaker 6:  I know Apple I think is course correcting in a lot of ways by making it

621
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:10,245
Speaker 6:  much easier to port games both to iPhone

622
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:14,445
Speaker 6:  and Max using their backend software in a

623
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:17,925
Speaker 6:  very similar way to the way Steam allowed Proton

624
00:37:18,265 --> 00:37:21,925
Speaker 6:  to run all of these PC games on Linux. I think they

625
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:25,645
Speaker 6:  realized that people aren't gonna take the time to make the platform specific

626
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:29,645
Speaker 6:  pieces of software. Apple was not quite there yet. They're still kind of

627
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:32,085
Speaker 6:  one foot in, one foot out, but I think that is the future.

628
00:37:32,845 --> 00:37:36,565
Speaker 5:  I hear your theory and I think parts of it are right. I

629
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:39,805
Speaker 5:  wouldn't say that any of Apple's moves inspired

630
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:44,445
Speaker 5:  anything though because that would require believing that

631
00:37:44,535 --> 00:37:48,445
Speaker 5:  Apple at any point would even make a mild

632
00:37:48,845 --> 00:37:52,725
Speaker 5:  competent effort to get into this space. I don't think Nintendo

633
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:56,645
Speaker 5:  was like shaking in its boots that Apple was going to

634
00:37:56,645 --> 00:38:00,445
Speaker 5:  get into You know the Making Good Games business. Right. I think that they

635
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,365
Speaker 5:  were very concerned about the like free games

636
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:07,405
Speaker 5:  shovel wear. I, I think that was a a legitimate concern

637
00:38:08,145 --> 00:38:11,925
Speaker 5:  but I mean it really is astonishing how, how they have refused

638
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:16,005
Speaker 5:  to just put a controller wrapper around a iPhone. Yeah. That

639
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:19,685
Speaker 5:  you have to use a third party to do that and that that has been for a decade.

640
00:38:19,945 --> 00:38:22,885
Speaker 5:  The problem, while they say that You know we care about video games.

641
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:27,565
Speaker 5:  I I agree with fresh in that yeah, resident Evil four wouldn't have run but

642
00:38:27,565 --> 00:38:31,405
Speaker 5:  like most indie games would have, there is a way to solve

643
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:35,325
Speaker 5:  this problem. I I have to believe it's that they were making so much

644
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:39,245
Speaker 5:  money, so much money off of the type of mobile game apps they

645
00:38:39,245 --> 00:38:42,405
Speaker 5:  had. They just felt like, hey we don't even need to think about that. Like

646
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:46,005
Speaker 5:  that's not our problem. And then eventually You know life comes at you fast.

647
00:38:46,645 --> 00:38:50,245
Speaker 6:  I think it's also that Indies, you're right, like a lot of indie games would've

648
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:54,285
Speaker 6:  run on iPhone. I think those indies did not want to

649
00:38:54,285 --> 00:38:58,165
Speaker 6:  be in the same storefront as games that were being sold for a dollar

650
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:02,445
Speaker 6:  and or or free that like that's a really tough thing to fight

651
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:06,365
Speaker 6:  against Now Apple Solve has been Apple Arcade which allows you

652
00:39:06,365 --> 00:39:09,045
Speaker 6:  to subscribe and obviously you could bundle that all together with a cloud

653
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:12,765
Speaker 6:  subscription et cetera. And their services revenue has really increased

654
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:16,605
Speaker 6:  dramatically. Yeah. Over the last few years. That seems like more of a play

655
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:19,605
Speaker 6:  but that's a business play that's not like a game development play. And I

656
00:39:19,605 --> 00:39:23,565
Speaker 6:  know even though there have been real highlights on the Apple arcade list,

657
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:27,805
Speaker 6:  they've also been like very fallow times. So it's, it kind of is an up and

658
00:39:27,805 --> 00:39:31,005
Speaker 6:  down in terms of games you wanna play on there.

659
00:39:32,115 --> 00:39:35,565
Speaker 4:  Okay, we're gonna take one more break and then I will get into my last

660
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:40,005
Speaker 4:  Big Grand Unified theory about the future of handheld gaming and why it's

661
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:42,765
Speaker 4:  totally gonna win Tmm. We'll be right back.

662
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:47,035
Speaker 4:  All. right, we're back. My last theory, all I wrote down for this one is

663
00:40:47,035 --> 00:40:50,915
Speaker 4:  just Nintendo because a thing that I have learned as

664
00:40:50,935 --> 00:40:54,635
Speaker 4:  the longer I cover the gaming world and talk to people about it is that everybody

665
00:40:54,635 --> 00:40:58,595
Speaker 4:  kind of wants to be Nintendo all the time and Nintendo

666
00:40:58,935 --> 00:41:02,915
Speaker 4:  proved this thing can work. Like the Switch is very good and I think in

667
00:41:02,915 --> 00:41:06,435
Speaker 4:  a lot of ways accomplished a thing that

668
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:10,035
Speaker 4:  no one else has accomplished before where it made a thing that is

669
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:14,195
Speaker 4:  genuinely excellent as both a TV console and a

670
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:18,155
Speaker 4:  portable console. And I think it has been theoretically possible to

671
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:21,915
Speaker 4:  do some of that in some ways in the past. But the Switch just like did it

672
00:41:22,215 --> 00:41:26,155
Speaker 4:  and I kind of think because Nintendo did it and did

673
00:41:26,155 --> 00:41:30,035
Speaker 4:  it well that's just out of the bag now, right?

674
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:32,635
Speaker 4:  Like I think that is now the bar that everybody is going to have to figure

675
00:41:32,635 --> 00:41:35,605
Speaker 4:  out some way to clear If you wanna make a mainstream console,

676
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:39,685
Speaker 5:  I will. I will go a step further. Okay. I'll go many steps further.

677
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:43,765
Speaker 5:  I think there are four futures for

678
00:41:43,765 --> 00:41:47,645
Speaker 5:  handheld. Okay, ready? Nintendo is a video game console

679
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:51,685
Speaker 5:  that is also portable valve and now its

680
00:41:51,685 --> 00:41:55,485
Speaker 5:  competitors are PCs that are portable. Then there's

681
00:41:55,485 --> 00:41:59,245
Speaker 5:  the emulator machines which are like novelty toys and then

682
00:41:59,245 --> 00:42:03,045
Speaker 5:  there's the last one which I think Xbox is trying to corner

683
00:42:03,115 --> 00:42:06,165
Speaker 5:  this market. I think people see Game Pass as its main influence. I don't

684
00:42:06,165 --> 00:42:09,725
Speaker 5:  think that's true Xbox. What it really wants to be is Kindle.

685
00:42:10,145 --> 00:42:14,005
Speaker 5:  It wants to be the, we're not going to win any of

686
00:42:14,005 --> 00:42:17,845
Speaker 5:  these. We've we, we don't see ourselves as the winner. We see us as the thing

687
00:42:17,845 --> 00:42:21,565
Speaker 5:  that's everywhere you go, we wanna be on every screen that you have.

688
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,965
Speaker 5:  I think all of those are like valuable and interesting

689
00:42:26,325 --> 00:42:29,965
Speaker 5:  approaches to it. I think the mistake that people will make, what you said

690
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:33,085
Speaker 5:  is like, yeah, everybody sees Nintendo and says I wanna do Nintendo

691
00:42:34,105 --> 00:42:37,965
Speaker 5:  is that you don't realize no I need to do something different. Nintendo nailed

692
00:42:37,965 --> 00:42:41,925
Speaker 5:  that and they're owning that right now. Valve so far seems to

693
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:45,565
Speaker 5:  have like really nailed the PC gaming. I think Xbox is making a pretty

694
00:42:45,885 --> 00:42:49,565
Speaker 5:  competent play at whatever its thing is. I think that's honestly what a lot

695
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:53,085
Speaker 5:  of the whole Sony versus Xbox versus world

696
00:42:53,085 --> 00:42:56,885
Speaker 5:  governments was actually about is is the fear of

697
00:42:56,885 --> 00:43:00,805
Speaker 5:  that So I agree but I think Nintendo is just one

698
00:43:00,805 --> 00:43:04,405
Speaker 5:  pillar of this handheld first future that you

699
00:43:04,405 --> 00:43:04,845
Speaker 5:  described.

700
00:43:05,505 --> 00:43:09,245
Speaker 4:  So I, I think I agree except I think the gaming PC

701
00:43:09,245 --> 00:43:12,485
Speaker 4:  that's also portable and video game console that's also portable are

702
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:16,205
Speaker 4:  more closely going to resemble one another over time. I

703
00:43:16,205 --> 00:43:19,565
Speaker 6:  Think they already do really the biggest difference between a steam deck

704
00:43:19,565 --> 00:43:23,445
Speaker 6:  and a switch is just power. Yeah. There are so many games that run

705
00:43:23,445 --> 00:43:27,365
Speaker 6:  on both Steam Deck and Switch. Now obviously I know what

706
00:43:27,365 --> 00:43:28,405
Speaker 6:  plant's gonna say. Chris

707
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,765
Speaker 4:  Just stopped mid drink of water to disagree

708
00:43:30,765 --> 00:43:33,965
Speaker 6:  With me. Yeah, it was almost a spit take. It was almost great. You can fully

709
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:38,045
Speaker 6:  mod the games on a steam deck. You can add

710
00:43:38,885 --> 00:43:42,085
Speaker 6:  whatever your own software you can add, you can change the whole experience

711
00:43:42,105 --> 00:43:45,725
Speaker 6:  if you want. Plant says, I'm totally off base with these guesses on what

712
00:43:45,725 --> 00:43:46,285
Speaker 6:  he was gonna say.

713
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:49,925
Speaker 5:  Here's a better way of putting it. You're right. I made a mistake. If Steam

714
00:43:49,925 --> 00:43:53,605
Speaker 5:  Deck is the PC console, Nintendo is, is

715
00:43:54,085 --> 00:43:58,045
Speaker 5:  Nintendo the reason you buy the Switch, the reason Nintendo will

716
00:43:58,105 --> 00:44:02,045
Speaker 5:  always be dominant is because Mario met

717
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,125
Speaker 5:  Zelda, Pickman, smash Brothers, Mario Kart, all of those games.

718
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:10,405
Speaker 5:  Nintendo has throughout, its the vast majority of its history, long

719
00:44:10,405 --> 00:44:14,205
Speaker 5:  before it was making video games saw itself as a toy company and I

720
00:44:14,205 --> 00:44:17,565
Speaker 5:  believe it still does. And I think that is secret power

721
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:21,725
Speaker 5:  is that it makes interesting fun things. It

722
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:24,765
Speaker 5:  doesn't get too bogged down by the rest of it.

723
00:44:25,185 --> 00:44:28,965
Speaker 6:  And I would, I would add to that Nintendo interestingly enough is losing

724
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:33,405
Speaker 6:  the one differentiator their head outside of their exclusive software.

725
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:37,005
Speaker 6:  Because when the Nintendo Switch launched, it was the only game in town

726
00:44:37,395 --> 00:44:41,205
Speaker 6:  from a handheld high-end gaming perspective. And that is no longer

727
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:44,965
Speaker 6:  the case. So when we go to the Switch to, they kind of have to

728
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:49,085
Speaker 6:  rely on, we have these exclusive titles once again, which was

729
00:44:49,085 --> 00:44:52,885
Speaker 6:  really their strategy for like the Game Cube which kind of struggled the

730
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,805
Speaker 6:  weu, which kind of struggled. So it is not like smooth

731
00:44:56,805 --> 00:45:00,565
Speaker 6:  sailing necessarily, although they do have this huge install base and now

732
00:45:00,605 --> 00:45:03,965
Speaker 6:  a huge library. So like they're in much better position. But it is a much

733
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:07,125
Speaker 6:  more interesting competitive generation that we're stepping into.

734
00:45:07,765 --> 00:45:10,925
Speaker 4:  I totally agree with that, except it's called the Super Switch. That part's

735
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:11,285
Speaker 4:  very important.

736
00:45:11,435 --> 00:45:13,405
Speaker 5:  What if they call it the super we? Oh

737
00:45:13,405 --> 00:45:13,605
Speaker 6:  God,

738
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:17,565
Speaker 5:  Wait, super. Super. We go because

739
00:45:17,565 --> 00:45:21,445
Speaker 5:  like we go outside to play the, Ooh,

740
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:25,765
Speaker 4:  There we go. Okay, we're almost done here. We're almost, we should be long

741
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:29,405
Speaker 4:  done. Yeah, but we're almost done. I have two more questions for you and

742
00:45:29,405 --> 00:45:31,405
Speaker 4:  then then we're gonna get outta here. Two more things I've been thinking

743
00:45:31,405 --> 00:45:35,205
Speaker 4:  about. Okay. One is, if handhelds are

744
00:45:35,205 --> 00:45:39,085
Speaker 4:  the thing, if the next version of the like mainstream console that most people

745
00:45:39,225 --> 00:45:42,725
Speaker 4:  buy for Christmas every year is a handheld thing. And I increasingly believe

746
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:46,565
Speaker 4:  it's going to be where are Sony and Xbox

747
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:50,365
Speaker 4:  in this, why do you have, do we have any sense of what the hell these two

748
00:45:50,565 --> 00:45:51,005
Speaker 4:  companies are doing?

749
00:45:51,575 --> 00:45:55,525
Speaker 5:  David? Do You know that Sony has a new handheld?

750
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:56,725
Speaker 4:  I do. It's called the Portal.

751
00:45:57,115 --> 00:46:00,165
Speaker 5:  Okay. Okay. Okay. That's good. Knows I I, I wasn't like testing your research,

752
00:46:00,365 --> 00:46:04,205
Speaker 5:  I was actually more testing. Is Sony this bad at

753
00:46:04,405 --> 00:46:05,245
Speaker 5:  getting it promoted?

754
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:09,605
Speaker 4:  I literally, I don't count the portal because it is an accessory to the PSS

755
00:46:09,605 --> 00:46:13,045
Speaker 4:  five. Correct. It doesn't count. It's a, it's a fancy controller to the PSS

756
00:46:13,045 --> 00:46:16,365
Speaker 4:  five. And I actually think there's a really interesting world down the road

757
00:46:16,385 --> 00:46:19,165
Speaker 4:  in like a cloud gaming world where the controller becomes the console in

758
00:46:19,165 --> 00:46:22,445
Speaker 4:  a way that I think is very exciting and possibly very cool. That's not happening

759
00:46:22,445 --> 00:46:26,245
Speaker 4:  anytime soon. What I don't understand sincerely at this point is

760
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:30,405
Speaker 4:  why neither Sony nor the Xbox team at Microsoft seems

761
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:32,285
Speaker 4:  more invested in this space.

762
00:46:32,925 --> 00:46:36,645
Speaker 5:  I think I have an answer. Okay. And it's different for both. I think for

763
00:46:36,925 --> 00:46:40,325
Speaker 5:  Microsoft it's because historically they have seen themselves as a software

764
00:46:40,325 --> 00:46:40,645
Speaker 5:  company,

765
00:46:41,205 --> 00:46:43,165
Speaker 4:  A surface team. I don't buy that argument at all. No,

766
00:46:43,165 --> 00:46:44,805
Speaker 5:  I I'm saying, I'm saying historically. Okay,

767
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:45,925
Speaker 4:  Sure. Historically fine.

768
00:46:46,025 --> 00:46:49,205
Speaker 5:  But sure. I think that comes with like a lot of baggage. And I would say

769
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:53,165
Speaker 5:  for Sony, the irony is they make so much hardware

770
00:46:53,505 --> 00:46:56,045
Speaker 5:  of like every, like right, you're gonna get your headphones and your hair

771
00:46:56,095 --> 00:46:59,845
Speaker 5:  dryer. I remember there was Sony released

772
00:47:00,205 --> 00:47:04,005
Speaker 5:  a three D TV that you could play video games

773
00:47:04,025 --> 00:47:07,805
Speaker 5:  on and it was like a Sony PlayStation three D tv and if you

774
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,285
Speaker 5:  put on your three D glasses, you could actually have two people use full

775
00:47:11,285 --> 00:47:15,245
Speaker 5:  screen at the same time. Because three D was projecting the dual image.

776
00:47:15,245 --> 00:47:19,165
Speaker 5:  Right. Very neat. I had that meeting the next day. I went to another

777
00:47:19,165 --> 00:47:22,805
Speaker 5:  meeting with Sony and saw a three D tv, four video

778
00:47:22,815 --> 00:47:26,365
Speaker 5:  games that you could place games on with two glasses.

779
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:31,005
Speaker 5:  It was two separate teams making the same

780
00:47:31,235 --> 00:47:35,165
Speaker 5:  product. And I think that is a real challenge

781
00:47:35,505 --> 00:47:39,365
Speaker 5:  for Sony when they think about going out and making this is they have

782
00:47:39,585 --> 00:47:43,485
Speaker 5:  so many teams with different goals that I imagine it could

783
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:47,445
Speaker 5:  be quite difficult to get the Vita two through,

784
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:51,365
Speaker 5:  which is a shame because they came so close. The vita is

785
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:55,645
Speaker 5:  I think fresh and I both like, it was maybe our favorite video

786
00:47:55,755 --> 00:47:57,445
Speaker 5:  game console until the steam deck.

787
00:47:57,735 --> 00:47:59,165
Speaker 6:  Until the switch. The switch I think

788
00:47:59,165 --> 00:47:59,605
Speaker 5:  Until Switch, yeah.

789
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:02,165
Speaker 6:  Took it over. But yeah, and then the steam deck took it, took that over.

790
00:48:02,265 --> 00:48:05,965
Speaker 6:  Here's my prediction, and this is not based on anything I, but I think it

791
00:48:05,965 --> 00:48:09,565
Speaker 6:  would be cool. PlayStation has a tendency, actually all consoles have a tendency

792
00:48:09,585 --> 00:48:13,405
Speaker 6:  to, when the generation, the console generation comes to an end, they release

793
00:48:13,405 --> 00:48:16,645
Speaker 6:  like a little mini version of that console. 'cause the hardware is super,

794
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:20,525
Speaker 6:  super cheap by then. And they put that out there and that becomes like You

795
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:24,325
Speaker 6:  know, oh, you buy that as a gift on Christmas for 150 bucks, whatever. At

796
00:48:24,325 --> 00:48:28,205
Speaker 6:  the end of the, let's say PlayStation five generation, when

797
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:31,805
Speaker 6:  that hardware is super cheap, throw that hardware into a little handheld

798
00:48:32,195 --> 00:48:36,125
Speaker 6:  promise that every PS five game and everything before it will run on this

799
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:39,885
Speaker 6:  handheld. That seems like a strategy that I would totally get behind.

800
00:48:40,435 --> 00:48:44,245
Speaker 5:  Give me Xbox series S mobile right now

801
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:48,285
Speaker 6:  It's not that far off in terms of its size, like it's 50% smaller

802
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:49,165
Speaker 6:  and you're kind of there.

803
00:48:49,475 --> 00:48:52,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And, and, and again, that runs into exactly what we were talking about

804
00:48:52,765 --> 00:48:56,245
Speaker 5:  with like there will still be some games that won't run, which is true for

805
00:48:56,485 --> 00:49:00,205
Speaker 5:  S versus series X, which is still just the worst naming convention.

806
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:00,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's awful.

807
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:04,445
Speaker 4:  I have really come to a point where like the more I've gotten into this,

808
00:49:04,445 --> 00:49:07,285
Speaker 4:  the more I've come to see it is basically like, there's like four

809
00:49:07,965 --> 00:49:11,445
Speaker 4:  versions of how to play games now, right? There's like the

810
00:49:11,955 --> 00:49:15,525
Speaker 4:  mega intense custom PC build. Like gaming

811
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:19,925
Speaker 4:  PCs is one area. There's like the Xbox, PlayStation

812
00:49:20,045 --> 00:49:23,485
Speaker 4:  consoles, there's the people who play games on their

813
00:49:23,485 --> 00:49:27,245
Speaker 4:  smartphones and then there's gaming handhelds. And if those are like,

814
00:49:27,355 --> 00:49:31,005
Speaker 4:  it's sort of crude, but that is like the four categories I've come to think

815
00:49:31,005 --> 00:49:33,805
Speaker 4:  of. Am I, does that make sense? Am I missing any in the, in the landscape

816
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:34,005
Speaker 4:  there?

817
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,445
Speaker 6:  Sounds pretty comprehensive.

818
00:49:35,715 --> 00:49:39,485
Speaker 4:  Nice. Okay. My theory is what happens in the next 10 years

819
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:43,245
Speaker 4:  is that those four things basically coalesce into two. I think the, like

820
00:49:43,385 --> 00:49:46,965
Speaker 4:  the consoles go up towards the PCs where it's like we're gonna have, there's

821
00:49:46,965 --> 00:49:50,925
Speaker 4:  always going to be a market for people who want these super, super high

822
00:49:50,925 --> 00:49:54,205
Speaker 4:  settings on Allen Wake two stuff. Those people are going to be increasingly

823
00:49:54,205 --> 00:49:58,005
Speaker 4:  well-served by increasingly amazing hardware. And then I think the sort of

824
00:49:58,005 --> 00:50:01,765
Speaker 4:  casual user of consoles, the handheld consoles and

825
00:50:01,785 --> 00:50:05,165
Speaker 4:  the mobile games all get sort of smooshed together

826
00:50:05,905 --> 00:50:09,565
Speaker 4:  in this thing you can hold in your hand or doc to your television world.

827
00:50:09,585 --> 00:50:13,245
Speaker 4:  And I think that's where most people are gonna live in the next 10 years.

828
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:15,965
Speaker 4:  That's my big theory. That's where I've landed at the end of all of this.

829
00:50:16,325 --> 00:50:19,885
Speaker 6:  I totally agree with that. I think you're 100% accurate. I don't think there's

830
00:50:19,885 --> 00:50:23,805
Speaker 6:  gonna be a ton of games that will be made exclusively for

831
00:50:24,025 --> 00:50:27,445
Speaker 6:  the high end market that you were just telling. I think we will continue

832
00:50:27,445 --> 00:50:31,285
Speaker 6:  to see all these games eventually, whether it's at launch or six months

833
00:50:31,285 --> 00:50:34,765
Speaker 6:  after or a year after trickle down to that more casual group.

834
00:50:35,345 --> 00:50:38,645
Speaker 6:  But I totally see that becoming the majority.

835
00:50:39,195 --> 00:50:43,085
Speaker 5:  Only one trick to it that I, I, I don't know how this plays out.

836
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:47,165
Speaker 5:  I think the laptop is the destroyer of the, of worlds,

837
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:51,565
Speaker 5:  of like mediums. I think the laptop is like, what got

838
00:50:51,575 --> 00:50:54,925
Speaker 5:  music piracy, like really going teenagers having a laptop in their room and

839
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:57,685
Speaker 5:  they could like dig into it without being on the family computer, right?

840
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:02,085
Speaker 5:  I think the laptop used to have ADVD player and got people

841
00:51:02,085 --> 00:51:05,525
Speaker 5:  really accustomed to watching movies on their

842
00:51:05,785 --> 00:51:09,765
Speaker 5:  laptop and then that made a natural transition into streaming, which has

843
00:51:09,785 --> 00:51:13,765
Speaker 5:  led to all of these issues, right? And I think the kind of like

844
00:51:13,835 --> 00:51:17,805
Speaker 5:  weirdly end game, it feels like these always play out in a similar way, is

845
00:51:17,805 --> 00:51:21,525
Speaker 5:  the laptop, is the, is truly the one device that that does it all, even more

846
00:51:21,525 --> 00:51:25,365
Speaker 5:  so than your phone. And I just wonder what that is

847
00:51:25,425 --> 00:51:29,325
Speaker 5:  for games, like will games follow that trend? Is that going to be cloud

848
00:51:29,325 --> 00:51:33,085
Speaker 5:  gaming? Right? It is always like a little weird that you can play

849
00:51:33,085 --> 00:51:36,965
Speaker 5:  games better on your phone than on your MacBook

850
00:51:36,965 --> 00:51:40,765
Speaker 5:  Air or MacBook Pro. But I I, I'm just curious. I I, I truly don't have

851
00:51:41,005 --> 00:51:44,725
Speaker 5:  an answer, but I do think it's valuable to look at like historical precedent

852
00:51:44,825 --> 00:51:48,565
Speaker 5:  and wonder what is the thing I'm missing? It feels like

853
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:51,005
Speaker 5:  there's something there that I, we've yet to see yet. And I think that's

854
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:54,965
Speaker 5:  what Google Stadia was trying to get at. They really liked the idea that

855
00:51:54,965 --> 00:51:58,005
Speaker 5:  you would be watching a streamer and then you would just open a browser tab

856
00:51:58,105 --> 00:52:01,405
Speaker 5:  and and start playing with them. But You know so much for that.

857
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:05,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well, and, and if, again, if the world we're headed to, like Fresh

858
00:52:05,505 --> 00:52:09,045
Speaker 4:  was saying earlier, is this one where you have a screen and a control mechanism

859
00:52:09,185 --> 00:52:12,605
Speaker 4:  and games are games and you can, you can kind of get at them with any screen

860
00:52:12,605 --> 00:52:15,205
Speaker 4:  and any control mechanism you have in front of you. The experience might

861
00:52:15,205 --> 00:52:18,405
Speaker 4:  change slightly. The settings might change slightly, but like the game is

862
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:22,085
Speaker 4:  the game then ultimately it doesn't, it doesn't even necessarily have to

863
00:52:22,085 --> 00:52:25,805
Speaker 4:  break down once you sit down at your laptop. That is not the world we live

864
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:29,205
Speaker 4:  in now. My like hottest take ever is, I think Stadia was like right about

865
00:52:29,205 --> 00:52:32,645
Speaker 4:  the way the world should be and wrong about the way the world is. And I like

866
00:52:32,645 --> 00:52:36,445
Speaker 4:  wish Stadia had worked with every fiber of my being, but it was also never

867
00:52:36,605 --> 00:52:40,125
Speaker 4:  going to. But that's neither nor there. We'll cover that some other day.

868
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:43,445
