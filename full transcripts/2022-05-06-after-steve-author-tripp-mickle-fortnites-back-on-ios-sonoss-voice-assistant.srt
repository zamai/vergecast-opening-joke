Description: Nilay Patel and David Pierce chat with Tripp Mickle, a New York Times reporter and the author of a new book titled After Steve: How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost its Soul. They talk about the rise of Jony Ive and Tim Cook, the power struggle between the two, and how Apple is grappling with everything from building a car to managing its relationship with the Chinese government.
After that, Verge managing editor Alex Cranz joins the show to talk about Starlink’s new Portability mode, HP’s super high-end new Chromebook, Fortnite coming back to iOS courtesy of Xbox Cloud Gaming, Sonos’s upcoming soundbar and voice assistant, and why Siri can’t seem to successfully close Nilay’s garage.

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,460
Speaker 1:  source. Then Alex cran comes on to tell us all about this

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,460
Speaker 1:  week in gadget scores. That's coming up right after

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,350
Speaker 1:  this.

7
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,270
Speaker 3:  Hello and welcome to the verge cast the flagship podcast, the form

8
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,570
Speaker 3:  over function. It looks good, David. What's up, man?

9
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,540
Speaker 5:  Hi, I'm David Pearson. I'm your friend who will always loan you a billion

10
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,980
Speaker 5:  dollars when you want to buy it Twitter.

11
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,040
Speaker 3:  There you go. Oh, by the way, I'm Nila. I'm also your friend. I will not

12
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,650
Speaker 3:  give you any money for any reason. We've got a great show for you today,

13
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,530
Speaker 3:  David, I'm going to talk to Tripp Mikel, who just wrote a book called after

14
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,490
Speaker 3:  Steve. We talked about in the show last week. It's all about apple. And

15
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,390
Speaker 3:  the 10 years after Steve jobs died, very much focused on Tim cook and

16
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,630
Speaker 3:  Johnny Ives. And then a little later, Alex Cranz is going to join us with

17
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,450
Speaker 3:  toxin gadgets. David, you worked with Tripp.

18
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,380
Speaker 5:  I did. So we overlapped when we were both at the wall street journal a

19
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,370
Speaker 5:  few years ago and I got to see him sort of spin up on the apple beet

20
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,970
Speaker 5:  and apple, as we have found many times is an

21
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,930
Speaker 5:  absolutely impossible company to get inside. Like it is its culture

22
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,590
Speaker 5:  of secrecy goes way back. And it is like

23
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,580
Speaker 5:  based on this being this tiny insular thing where like even the people who

24
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,580
Speaker 5:  work there don't know what the other people who work there are working on.

25
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,360
Speaker 5:  So I got to watch him sort of piece by piece, like get inside the company

26
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,300
Speaker 5:  and start to understand how it works. And I think he said, he's been working

27
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,600
Speaker 5:  on this book for like five years, which would track back to kind of when

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,170
Speaker 5:  I started working with him and he did a great job. Like most

29
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,980
Speaker 5:  books I've read about apple are about a product

30
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,810
Speaker 5:  and there they have this sort one very specific thread. Right? And you talk

31
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,150
Speaker 5:  to you talk to suppliers and you talk to people kind of around this thing

32
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,960
Speaker 5:  to understand like how a product came to be. But he got into like

33
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,260
Speaker 5:  how the company works and talked about org structures

34
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,800
Speaker 5:  and relationships between people and the kind of thing you just don't get.

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,950
Speaker 5:  A lot of, I really enjoyed the book and I know you did too.

36
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,910
Speaker 3:  I did. I think you'll hear it when we talk to, to trip. But you

37
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,870
Speaker 3:  know, the book is structured around two big characters, Tim cook and Johnny

38
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,830
Speaker 3:  eyes, and you can read it in a couple of different ways. All of those

39
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,820
Speaker 3:  ways will make people mad. You can read it is Johnny. I was the

40
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,480
Speaker 3:  sole of Apple's design and he left. And now apple is this like

41
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,320
Speaker 3:  services, drug or not financial company. I think a lot of people

42
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,350
Speaker 3:  think that about apple and that some of that there's evidence for that in

43
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,470
Speaker 3:  the book, but that's not the whole book. You can read it as Johnny. I've

44
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,220
Speaker 3:  got disengaged and Apple's design went sideways with iOS

45
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,090
Speaker 3:  seven and the first generation watch, which was pretty messy. And then he

46
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,030
Speaker 3:  left and everything got better. You can read it as Tim cook grew into the

47
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,180
Speaker 3:  role and became very confident after taking over for Steve jobs. Like there's

48
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,840
Speaker 3:  all these ways to read this book. And like I said, I think all of them make

49
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,260
Speaker 3:  everybody mad, but I think that's like the sign that

50
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,160
Speaker 3:  it's, it has the reporting to back up all of those claims.

51
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,950
Speaker 5:  Totally. And I think th the other only one I would add to that is that there

52
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,760
Speaker 5:  is just like, there's an unbearable hugeness of apple now

53
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,690
Speaker 5:  that like the company just got so big and had so much

54
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,230
Speaker 5:  money. And like, there's a, there's a bit in the book about when Warren buffet

55
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,380
Speaker 5:  invested in the company and there's this feeling of like, oh my God, this

56
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,340
Speaker 5:  means like regular people's money. Now it depends on the stuff that apple

57
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,270
Speaker 5:  does. And just like what that did to the culture of the company and the

58
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,910
Speaker 5:  fighting internally and all the people who wanted to be in charge of things.

59
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,450
Speaker 5:  And everybody's making hilarious amounts of money along the way. And it's,

60
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,510
Speaker 5:  it's just wild, but yeah, you can kind of take anything away from it you

61
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,520
Speaker 5:  want, and you're probably right.

62
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,130
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And it's, again, I think it's cause trip to the great shot reporting.

63
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,980
Speaker 3:  It that's enough of us. We should actually just talk to trip. Here we go.

64
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,940
Speaker 3:  Trip Mikel trip, Mikel. You are the author of

65
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,540
Speaker 3:  after Steve a book, which on this very show I

66
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,050
Speaker 3:  described as making everyone mad, welcome to the virtuous.

67
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,170
Speaker 6:  Thanks so much for having me. I like, I like getting people riled up. That's

68
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,040
Speaker 6:  why I'm here.

69
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,970
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The book is absolutely fascinating. It is about effectively the

70
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,870
Speaker 3:  relationship between Tim cook and Johnny ive, famous apple. If you're listening

71
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,480
Speaker 3:  to virtuous, you know who these people are like, you just, I dunno what you're

72
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,320
Speaker 3:  doing here, but it's about Tim cook and Johnny ive and how they grew into

73
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,010
Speaker 3:  their roles and out of their roles after the death of Steve jobs, why did

74
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,480
Speaker 3:  you start chasing this book? Then?

75
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,260
Speaker 6:  It's interesting. When I landed at the journal in 17, after coming

76
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,070
Speaker 6:  off what we call the sin, beat alcohol and tobacco, I had a cup of coffee

77
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,190
Speaker 6:  with John Markoff and he was like, you know, one thing you should really

78
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,910
Speaker 6:  look into is Johnny ive and the battery. And that's, that's about all

79
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,780
Speaker 6:  John John said, and I started asking questions and learn

80
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,680
Speaker 6:  pretty quickly that Johnny was growing disillusioned with, with

81
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,320
Speaker 6:  apple. And I just thought that was so interesting. How could you, how could

82
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,230
Speaker 6:  you help build this great company and then begin to kind of

83
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,890
Speaker 6:  fall out of love with it? So to speak, it just made me wonder what was, what

84
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,980
Speaker 6:  was behind the line. So I just kept asking more and more questions and eventually

85
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,630
Speaker 6:  he left in 2019.

86
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,330
Speaker 5:  Did this start out to be kind of a Johnny and Tim

87
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,390
Speaker 5:  story? Because part of what was so interesting to me about this as like the,

88
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,810
Speaker 5:  the initial frame is like, it's the sort of the story of Apple's decade,

89
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,710
Speaker 5:  right? And then almost immediately it's the Johnny and Tim story,

90
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,990
Speaker 5:  which to some extent makes sense, right? Like they're the two most important

91
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,290
Speaker 5:  people, the company, but like, was it obvious at the jump that, like, those

92
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,390
Speaker 5:  were the two main characters of this story,

93
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,020
Speaker 6:  The privilege that you're granted, when you get to do a book, as you, you're

94
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,830
Speaker 6:  given time to, to think and let the story kind of unfold,

95
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,670
Speaker 6:  as you think through structure and your, and, and what's your focus

96
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,510
Speaker 6:  on, and from the outset, I was planning to do the decade at

97
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,170
Speaker 6:  apple after Steve jobs. That was really the intention. But the

98
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,680
Speaker 6:  more I looked at that, the more, I felt like the best way to tell that

99
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,560
Speaker 6:  story was by chronicling the history of,

100
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,250
Speaker 6:  of Johnny and Tim. And so for a lot of readers who come to this, they're

101
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,210
Speaker 6:  going to say, well, why am I getting the history of apple all over

102
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,060
Speaker 6:  again? I I've, I've learned this from Isaacson's book, et cetera, but

103
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,990
Speaker 6:  you're going to get a different window into that because you're going to

104
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,920
Speaker 6:  be looking at Apple's history, history through Johnny Ives work,

105
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,730
Speaker 6:  and then through Tim Cook's work. And it just, it just lent itself to tell

106
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,330
Speaker 6:  the entire apple story through these two characters and

107
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,020
Speaker 6:  figures that are, that are so prominent at the company and really were, were

108
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,710
Speaker 6:  who jobs set up to lead the company toward it? It kind of naturally evolved

109
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,850
Speaker 6:  that way, honestly.

110
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,660
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So one of the central dynamics in the book and at apple

111
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,590
Speaker 3:  is before Steve jobs dies, he anoints

112
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,980
Speaker 3:  Johnny is that absolutely have designed and says, I set up the company said

113
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,700
Speaker 3:  no one can get in his way. And then no one got in his way. And some of the

114
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,030
Speaker 3:  problems that's true. And some of the products went completely sideways.

115
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,840
Speaker 3:  Meantime, Tim cook is casting about for Apple's

116
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,554
Speaker 3:  next big thing. And I don't know if anybody remembers that first year, 20

117
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:55,550
Speaker 3:  11, 20 12, Tim cook was like going on TV and saying, we're going to do it.

118
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,820
Speaker 3:  We're going to do TV stuff. Because jobs had ended the book by saying he'd

119
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,480
Speaker 3:  finally cracked TV, which seems like just a masterful troll at this

120
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,260
Speaker 3:  point. It is very unclear what he meant when he said to Walter

121
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,800
Speaker 3:  Isaacson, I've cracked it. And so apple, I chases after effort for a year

122
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,410
Speaker 3:  and they chase that for a car and they do all this other stuff. And it seems

123
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,400
Speaker 3:  like Tim cook is looking over there and he's given I've control over

124
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,730
Speaker 3:  the product portfolio, which I mean, apple is like the most successful company

125
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,340
Speaker 3:  in the world, but some of the products went completely sideways during this

126
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,850
Speaker 3:  period, right? The butterfly keyboard, the phones got thinner.

127
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,720
Speaker 3:  Like it just, there's a really weird moment for apple design in there.

128
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,320
Speaker 3:  That's my perspective from the outside. But reading the book, it seems like

129
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,560
Speaker 3:  there's actually more tension between the two than one's ever revealed,

130
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,490
Speaker 6:  Sir. I mean, there's, it's, it's an unspoken power struggle kind of over

131
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,450
Speaker 6:  what will be core to the company's future. You know,

132
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,260
Speaker 6:  Tim needs a new product category essentially after

133
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,380
Speaker 6:  Steve jobs stuff, because that's what the outside world is demanding and

134
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,260
Speaker 6:  pressuring apple to deliver. There was a lot of expectation for that.

135
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,250
Speaker 6:  And Johnny ive was the natural person to, to bring that forward. And the

136
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,210
Speaker 6:  watch was that answer. Ultimately, that's what they went with.

137
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,110
Speaker 6:  And then at the same time wall, Street's never satisfied. So Tim

138
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,620
Speaker 6:  cook has to almost think about, well, what's the next thing beyond that?

139
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,340
Speaker 6:  And the answer winds up being the services business that apple

140
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,970
Speaker 6:  unveiled really officially in, in 2019, but was

141
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,910
Speaker 6:  gradually building through the course of the beets

142
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,720
Speaker 6:  acquisition and some of the other product introductions along the

143
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,440
Speaker 6:  way.

144
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,510
Speaker 5:  I think power struggle is a really interesting way to put it because there's

145
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,290
Speaker 5:  a weird dynamic between the two of them where they never seemed to

146
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,010
Speaker 5:  fight. Like I kept waiting for like the meeting where Johnny and Tim like

147
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,850
Speaker 5:  had it out and it never really happened. They just sort of

148
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,780
Speaker 5:  increasingly like diverge paths. And Johnny did his thing while Tim did his

149
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,270
Speaker 5:  thing. And because Tim is CEO and because they were making a hell of a lot

150
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,260
Speaker 5:  of money Tim's way kept winning and Johnny just sort of fell further

151
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,860
Speaker 5:  and further apart from everything that apple was doing and then started to

152
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,250
Speaker 5:  distance himself and everything went away. But it was, it was just so interesting

153
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,040
Speaker 5:  to me to watch just like Tim, just sort of like subsume

154
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,790
Speaker 5:  everything, at least as far as I could tell, without any particular

155
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,240
Speaker 5:  like angry power grab over the design team.

156
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,600
Speaker 6:  Well, that's just a reflection of Tim's own inscrutability right. I mean,

157
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,260
Speaker 6:  there's, there's this, there's a certain degree of unknowability about him,

158
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,190
Speaker 6:  his relationships with people aren't as strong

159
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,060
Speaker 6:  as say, jobs, individual relationships with a lot of people were. And so

160
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,900
Speaker 6:  it's an, it's a natural outgrowth of that. And then also Tim's

161
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,140
Speaker 6:  decision to be deferential to the creative people.

162
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,920
Speaker 6:  He, the way apple was structured when jobs was alive

163
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,580
Speaker 6:  was jobs was at the, at the center of it. And the creative people were in

164
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,880
Speaker 6:  the, in the ring right around him. And that's what he was kind of

165
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,660
Speaker 6:  migrating around. I mean, from meetings with design

166
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,080
Speaker 6:  team, to meetings, with the software, people, to meetings with the advertising

167
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,820
Speaker 6:  people to come up with the next creative ads and everything else. And

168
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,810
Speaker 6:  then beyond that in the ring outside of that

169
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,220
Speaker 6:  was operations and finance

170
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,970
Speaker 6:  and legal and some of the other aspects of the company

171
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,930
Speaker 6:  and what happened when jobs died and Tim cook became CEO is all

172
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,800
Speaker 6:  of a sudden the operations people came to the interior of the company.

173
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,550
Speaker 6:  It's almost like throwing a rock into a pond and they were just ripples that

174
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,670
Speaker 6:  kind of float across everything. And everyone tried to

175
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,630
Speaker 6:  reassess how they fit into this new world. And Tim's

176
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,530
Speaker 6:  choice in that new world was not to try to replace Steve, not to get involved

177
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,560
Speaker 6:  in product because he didn't feel comfortable doing so

178
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,250
Speaker 3:  How do you see that playing out with things like beets, right? Where

179
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,060
Speaker 3:  he actually brought in some very powerful creatives, like the

180
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,300
Speaker 3:  idea that Trent Reznor was ever an apple employee is like, to me very funny,

181
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,170
Speaker 3:  right? Like it's just a track, but you're right. He buys his

182
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,110
Speaker 3:  company because he wants to get into services and he sees that they've already

183
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,920
Speaker 3:  built something they want, he's got a headphone company to deal with as well.

184
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,220
Speaker 3:  That's a big integration. It's like still one of Apple's biggest deals

185
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,830
Speaker 3:  ever, but he brought in these huge creatives from my

186
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,580
Speaker 3:  perspective on the outside. Never really did anything. But in, in your

187
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,060
Speaker 3:  book there, they're like in the background of a lot of things in

188
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,090
Speaker 3:  complicated ways, like how did that dynamic play out

189
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,510
Speaker 6:  There's pressure at that point in time, right? To satisfy wall street, deliver

190
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,990
Speaker 6:  more growth. And one of the easiest ways to deliver growth is to acquire

191
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,950
Speaker 6:  it. The fascinating thing to me in reporting this and, and the

192
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,310
Speaker 6:  fascinating thing to a lot of the beets staff who were

193
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,300
Speaker 6:  acquired was once they got inside apple, they realized that apple had

194
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,570
Speaker 6:  been at work already on building out a subscription music

195
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,320
Speaker 6:  business. But there was some for whatever reason, there were some

196
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,100
Speaker 6:  disfat satisfaction internally with what that looked like and

197
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,060
Speaker 6:  are in a field that they needed some help from the beats creative team.

198
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,840
Speaker 6:  So that's why they went out and they brought him beat. They refashioned beats,

199
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,320
Speaker 6:  they released apple music. It's a course flawed. And

200
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,250
Speaker 6:  then, you know, lo and behold, not that long afterwards, all of the beats

201
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,910
Speaker 6:  staff kind of peel away eventually because this is a

202
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,780
Speaker 6:  giant company with very well-defined rules. And it's not

203
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,630
Speaker 6:  kind of the, I don't know, the, the kind of

204
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,560
Speaker 6:  rambunctious rebellious place that Jimmy Ivan had

205
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,750
Speaker 6:  fashioned beats music.

206
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,620
Speaker 3:  But that to me is like, right, as apple becomes this bigger content company.

207
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,070
Speaker 3:  And now they've got these big Hollywood ambitions, the interplay between

208
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,730
Speaker 3:  the inscrutability of Tim cook, the nature of

209
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,420
Speaker 3:  Apple's brand, and then the reality of making good

210
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,380
Speaker 3:  art, whether that's music or movies or whatever those things are

211
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,920
Speaker 3:  like in conflict. And that seems like one of the hardest challenges

212
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,700
Speaker 3:  that Tim very personally has been dealing with outside

213
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,660
Speaker 3:  of Johnny Ives, making iOS seven look insane. Right? Like it

214
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,240
Speaker 3:  seems like that was more of a distraction than the products, which is really

215
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,110
Speaker 3:  fascinating to me.

216
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,140
Speaker 6:  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. It's an, it's an interesting point, I think. Well,

217
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,040
Speaker 6:  is that the journal we had, we had fun with a piece about Hollywood

218
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,370
Speaker 6:  adjusting to Apple's arrival and its expectations for what

219
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,240
Speaker 6:  content should look like and include. And there

220
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,990
Speaker 6:  was some real trepidation inside apple early on about

221
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,830
Speaker 6:  showing anything with too much vulgarity,

222
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,950
Speaker 6:  nudity, et cetera. They really wanted kind of a clean cut

223
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,220
Speaker 6:  image. And they've since abandoned some of those

224
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,790
Speaker 6:  inclinations and they've adopted a bit more of an HBO style

225
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,690
Speaker 6:  approach. There's obviously some, I don't know, some

226
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,590
Speaker 6:  interesting content like within the morning show and everything else

227
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,160
Speaker 6:  that suggests that they've made peace with being more dynamic, but I found

228
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,120
Speaker 6:  it fascinating to see that they won a best picture for Coda, which

229
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,540
Speaker 6:  for all intents and purposes, like Disney could have made that movie. Right.

230
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,150
Speaker 6:  I mean, it's a, it is a really feel good film.

231
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,870
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's the exact kind of thing that I'm sure Tim cook was like thrilled

232
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,680
Speaker 5:  to win for. Whereas like I've been watching the show, shining girls on TV

233
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,190
Speaker 5:  plus, which is basically just all about women dying and being

234
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,940
Speaker 5:  murdered and going back and like thinking about that piece, you did where

235
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,150
Speaker 5:  Tim cook is like mad that there's cursing in some of the shows it's like,

236
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,530
Speaker 5:  boy, things have changed.

237
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,900
Speaker 6:  And part of that speaks to, to this, this kind of like

238
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,800
Speaker 6:  persistence and cautiousness that they approach things

239
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,640
Speaker 6:  with. Now, I think for a lot of people, that's, that's been the jarring thing

240
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,420
Speaker 6:  about watching apple lately is they remember the, the

241
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,200
Speaker 6:  two thousands and, and kind of all the perfect products that they

242
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,920
Speaker 6:  felt like they, they just arrived. Perfect. Some people forget that it

243
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,850
Speaker 6:  took a little while for the iPod to be as great as it was, but they have

244
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,030
Speaker 6:  this recollection of it being a perfect product. And they were watching and

245
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,720
Speaker 6:  struggling with like, well, why are they only having like 10 shows on this

246
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,930
Speaker 6:  new product that they've launched? You know, why is it taking so long to

247
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,620
Speaker 6:  build this? Why is, why is major league baseball? Why are there three people

248
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,460
Speaker 6:  in the booth? And then why are they, you know, why are they

249
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,670
Speaker 6:  struggling to explain what's going on in the game? There are these like moments

250
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,480
Speaker 6:  of imprecision that people are unaccustomed to, but I think that's

251
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,380
Speaker 6:  emblematic of this giant company trying to get things right

252
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,310
Speaker 6:  and having the leeway to do so because it's got so much

253
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,270
Speaker 6:  great reach with how many people who have an iPhone and everything else.

254
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,170
Speaker 3:  So the reason I wanted to start with like TV and content and just lay that

255
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,740
Speaker 3:  foundation, because right now it's very clear that Tim cook cares about Hollywood

256
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,100
Speaker 3:  and he wants celebrities on his streaming platforms. I think that's all just

257
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,880
Speaker 3:  a cover for the real services revenue, which is in that purchases and games.

258
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,000
Speaker 3:  And he has to talk about re Reese Witherspoon said, but right. It's very

259
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,960
Speaker 3:  clear that he's engaged that part of the industry like Hollywood

260
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,860
Speaker 3:  and apple are very close now, but a huge part of the book

261
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,340
Speaker 3:  is Johnny Ives saying we're a fashion company now and bringing in a bunch

262
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,880
Speaker 3:  of fashion people, especially around the watch and

263
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,600
Speaker 3:  losing focus on products. Like he's like, there's a line. I actually

264
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,750
Speaker 3:  sent a screen, a, I took a picture of the book and sent it to Walt

265
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,470
Speaker 3:  Mossberg. Or Johnny's like, our future is in the hands of like Anna

266
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,680
Speaker 3:  Wintour, not Walmart's bird. And while it was like, well, it turned

267
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,550
Speaker 3:  out, we were still pretty important, but that dynamic, right. You

268
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,970
Speaker 3:  see, I'm just curious how you see that evolution, that they, they went really

269
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,510
Speaker 3:  hard at fashion with a watch. It distracted them from making the products

270
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,080
Speaker 3:  really great, the watch in particular. But now they're back to

271
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,960
Speaker 3:  Hollywood. Like they're back in that same cultural sphere.

272
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,430
Speaker 3:  They tried really hard with Johnny, but Tim has sort of like diligently got

273
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,510
Speaker 3:  himself back into.

274
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,270
Speaker 6:  It's interesting that you raise that and you bring up the fashion thing.

275
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,990
Speaker 6:  I really wrestled with that and came into reporting on that with the

276
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,830
Speaker 6:  same mindset that a lot of people look back on that

277
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,490
Speaker 6:  period with this day in age, where they say like, why the

278
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,300
Speaker 6:  heck did they do that? And I was curious about that as I, as I went into

279
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,230
Speaker 6:  it and I left through my reporting somewhat persuaded that that actually

280
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,100
Speaker 6:  was not a misguided focus. There's a scene that a lot of people point

281
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,820
Speaker 6:  to who worked on the watch from the devil wears Prada,

282
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,270
Speaker 6:  where the woman who's kind of playing the character of Anna Wintour.

283
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,870
Speaker 6:  Upbraids the Anne Hathaway character over having on this

284
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,800
Speaker 6:  surillian blue sweater and not realizing that it was

285
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,640
Speaker 6:  introduced in fashion two years earlier. And the entire reason

286
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,340
Speaker 6:  that gap is selling it is because that it was on a runway

287
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,270
Speaker 6:  two years before and internally inside apple, for those

288
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,260
Speaker 6:  who kind of were on the fashion leaning side of this thing, that

289
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,040
Speaker 6:  was, that was important because they were introducing a watch that was going

290
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,190
Speaker 6:  to look identical. And if you, if you think back to your early reviews of

291
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,730
Speaker 6:  it, that was one of the things I think you struggled with was, well, this,

292
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,540
Speaker 6:  this looks the same from, from on everybody's wrist and that's

293
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,470
Speaker 6:  not the way watches typically were. So they needed the endorsement

294
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,430
Speaker 6:  of society's tastemakers in order to get that thing off the ground.

295
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,180
Speaker 6:  The problem was that maybe they lean too far into that. And they had to

296
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,170
Speaker 6:  course correct relatively quickly and get into the fitness aspect of it

297
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,470
Speaker 6:  so that people could use it. But really the, ultimately the problem was it

298
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,040
Speaker 6:  just didn't have any battery life. Like if you look back, you know, it just,

299
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,280
Speaker 6:  it, you know, it was dead half the time it was on your wrist. Like that's,

300
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,110
Speaker 6:  that's not the most useful product.

301
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,750
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The thing that really jumped out to me was that like, there's a lot

302
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,290
Speaker 5:  of the apple marketing team in this book, which I think is appropriate. And

303
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:50,130
Speaker 5:  like I've had, I still remember a bunch of years ago, an apple exec who was

304
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,380
Speaker 5:  like leaving the company. He was talking to me and they were like, yeah,

305
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,950
Speaker 5:  the only smart people who work at apple are all in the marketing team. And

306
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,930
Speaker 5:  they're, they're kind of all over this book. And the thing that struck me

307
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,920
Speaker 5:  about the watch thing was that like the fashion piece of it was smart marketing,

308
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,900
Speaker 5:  I think you're right. And they were like, they were talking about it as like

309
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,330
Speaker 5:  the most personal device. And they had all these different bands and like

310
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,030
Speaker 5:  there's a world in which that could have worked. It's just that the product

311
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,630
Speaker 5:  wasn't that good. And there's so much of it in this book where it's like

312
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,540
Speaker 5:  Johnny really wanted to build a watch. He didn't really know why the health

313
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,470
Speaker 5:  stuff didn't really work. The fitness stuff. Wasn't ready. The battery

314
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,250
Speaker 5:  wasn't very good. It's just like, they, they didn't have the thing to

315
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,790
Speaker 5:  sell in the same way that they did with the iPhone. So if they had like had

316
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,000
Speaker 5:  a very good product and then sold it as fashion, it would have worked. But

317
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,600
Speaker 5:  that was the only thing it had going for it in those earliest days. And the

318
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,930
Speaker 5:  only thing they were selling about it. And it felt like that to me, was where

319
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,090
Speaker 5:  it was like, okay, this is just the part that they missed.

320
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,090
Speaker 6:  And that's, that's some of the shakeout that you see kind of post Steve.

321
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,850
Speaker 6:  There was a, there's a great moment at the end of one chapter, as they're

322
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,540
Speaker 6:  about to launch the watch where you have the lead engineer, pull

323
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,320
Speaker 6:  aside Jeff Williams and say, Jeff, I'm going to ask you a question. If you

324
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,130
Speaker 6:  came to work today and you forgot your iPhone, what would you do? And Jeff

325
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,580
Speaker 6:  said something to the effect about I'd go home and get, get my iPhone. Like

326
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,240
Speaker 6:  I need my iPhone to make it through a day. And the engineer looks at him,

327
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,930
Speaker 6:  says, well, if you forgot your watch, what would you do? I guess I get it

328
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,830
Speaker 6:  when I got home. And the engineer's point was, that's the reason we can't

329
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,580
Speaker 6:  launch this product. It's not ready. It's not something people need to

330
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,450
Speaker 6:  have. I think they've gotten there over time, but it's taken quite

331
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,680
Speaker 6:  some time to get there.

332
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,220
Speaker 3:  So two things, one, I love the devil wears Prada. I watch it whenever it's

333
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,090
Speaker 3:  on TV, it's a good

334
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,050
Speaker 5:  Scene too.

335
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,560
Speaker 3:  It's a good scene. And I think that I'm Anne Hathaway and my wife has always

336
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,280
Speaker 3:  reminded me that I'm not assuming It's a real problem.

337
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,940
Speaker 3:  Explains a lot about how the verge works. But in that, I just want to put

338
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,930
Speaker 3:  our focus on the watches, a gadget, right? My pushback, when I wrote through

339
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,960
Speaker 3:  a view of the first watch was like, this thing is a mess, right? It's actually

340
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,410
Speaker 3:  not a very good gadget. And maybe you can talk all this game about

341
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,170
Speaker 3:  fashion and you can tell me that the digital crown is a

342
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,070
Speaker 3:  revolutionary input device on par with the mouse and the

343
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,970
Speaker 3:  touch, which is what they said, right. But the underlying work

344
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,720
Speaker 3:  to make this thing a great gadget isn't there. And it's when they

345
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,260
Speaker 3:  made it a great gadget that it became this huge success and they didn't actually

346
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,010
Speaker 3:  need all the fashion focus. If they had just made a great gadget

347
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,730
Speaker 3:  from the jump, the fashion stuff would have just come along for the ride.

348
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,630
Speaker 3:  That feels like to me, where apple got lost, when they started taking for

349
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,470
Speaker 3:  granted that they would make great gadgets and the industry would follow

350
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,220
Speaker 3:  them. And what they really were, what was like a lifestyle

351
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,100
Speaker 3:  company. Right? And that's where you get, at least from my

352
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,280
Speaker 3:  perspective is just someone who like, thinks about the products

353
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,580
Speaker 3:  themselves. That's where you get, well, we're going to take all the ports

354
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,940
Speaker 3:  off the computer. And you're just going to Johnny is going to

355
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,180
Speaker 3:  change the industry because he wants fewer reports on the

356
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,020
Speaker 3:  computer or the phone's going to be a little too thin and maybe it'll bend

357
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,440
Speaker 3:  a little bit, eat more easily than it should. Or the battery life will be

358
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,130
Speaker 3:  really low. And then he leaves and like apple

359
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,820
Speaker 3:  corrects that stuff really fast, right? They go back to making really great

360
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,510
Speaker 3:  gadgets. Is that all Johnny in that moment, that's like pushing it

361
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:02,290
Speaker 3:  towards more aesthetic features or is it a push and pull?

362
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,870
Speaker 6:  It's certainly a consequence of his philosophy

363
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,400
Speaker 6:  and a push gradually towards thinness. And a lot of

364
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,060
Speaker 6:  people will come at this book and be like, well, why didn't you write about

365
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,660
Speaker 6:  the butterfly keyboard and the fiasco there. And you, anytime

366
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,690
Speaker 6:  you're, you're a writer, you guys can appreciate this. You do this all the

367
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,810
Speaker 6:  time. You got to pick and choose. You gotta, you gotta make choices. And

368
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,350
Speaker 6:  especially with something like a book, it's got to connect across like a

369
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:30,190
Speaker 6:  long period of time. That was something that I chose not to

370
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,030
Speaker 6:  focus on because in my reporting and you all's reporting may differ from

371
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,300
Speaker 6:  this. I kept hearing that that was more of an

372
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,540
Speaker 6:  engineering shortcoming than anything else.

373
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,050
Speaker 6:  And that engineers had allowed that to

374
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,040
Speaker 6:  happen rather than the designers now, philosophically, what were the

375
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,850
Speaker 6:  engineers trying to do? Fulfill the expectations of designers who wanted

376
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,360
Speaker 6:  things to be thinner, that, that those were kind of the marching orders

377
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,780
Speaker 6:  and is partly an outgrowth of this culture that

378
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,720
Speaker 6:  was directly descended from jobs, empowering design

379
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,580
Speaker 6:  so much and turning these guys into kind of the

380
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,510
Speaker 6:  jetties who can do no wrong inside of apple. Right. That worked when

381
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,990
Speaker 6:  jobs was there as an editor, but it, it got out of whack

382
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,980
Speaker 6:  when they were, I guess, less left to their own devices.

383
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,130
Speaker 5:  Well, and wasn't it job. So has used to say like, design is how it works,

384
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,310
Speaker 5:  right? Like it, it feels like that's the part that seemed like it just sort

385
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,850
Speaker 5:  of fell apart over time to Neil's point that like, and I think you even kind

386
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,240
Speaker 5:  of say it at the end of the book, that, that it became like a form over function

387
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,140
Speaker 5:  company. And then Johnny is off, like spent helping build an office

388
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,830
Speaker 5:  where people keep running into the glass walls and which is just like, what

389
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,460
Speaker 5:  a perfect metaphor for the whole thing right there. And he's spending his

390
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,340
Speaker 5:  time on this, like one Leica camera and worrying about

391
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,880
Speaker 5:  the soap dispensers on his plane. And it, it just, you, you could just sort

392
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,870
Speaker 5:  of feel it fall away into like, fashion, right? It's

393
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,430
Speaker 5:  like, it's not about how the thing works

394
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,120
Speaker 3:  Well. So let me ask the hard question to follow up on David's point. I think

395
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,100
Speaker 3:  everybody should read this book. It will make everybody mad in different

396
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,940
Speaker 3:  directions. It's a good time. I would say the most, the experts that have

397
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,810
Speaker 3:  been published in the times and elsewhere, the thing that is like most

398
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,710
Speaker 3:  focused, that sort of anger is the sense that the book is about Tim

399
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,700
Speaker 3:  cook, letting Johnny ive getaway, right. And that Johnny ive drifting

400
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,690
Speaker 3:  off and not feeling engaged is somehow an error in apple has lost

401
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,590
Speaker 3:  its magic because of that, I would argue that actually he should have

402
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,580
Speaker 3:  clipped Johnny earlier and let him go when he was on his way out the

403
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,420
Speaker 3:  first time. Yep. In spare the company, that weird middle period where his

404
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,620
Speaker 3:  focus was split.

405
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,160
Speaker 5:  That's my read

406
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,400
Speaker 3:  Too. But I think a lot of people are mad about that idea too. So like where,

407
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,920
Speaker 3:  where do you come down having written this whole thing?

408
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,700
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That's a fair point. You can pick apart flaws and what

409
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,690
Speaker 6:  both men did. And then you also have to ground those flaws. And

410
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,780
Speaker 6:  the fact that both men were grieving. And, and that's something that I think

411
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,740
Speaker 6:  is just fundamental, that gets misplaced. When, whenever you talk

412
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,640
Speaker 6:  about this company, like for those who worked with jobs, you know, his

413
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,540
Speaker 6:  death and the fallout from that, and having to come back to work and

414
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,440
Speaker 6:  facing criticism and expectations externally, that's

415
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,410
Speaker 6:  really hard. That's really hard to deal with. And in the wake of that, they,

416
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:14,030
Speaker 6:  they galvanize themselves around the watch. And one of Johnny's

417
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,810
Speaker 6:  errors and doing that is he takes on a bunch of other

418
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,260
Speaker 6:  different projects concurrently with it. He takes

419
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,290
Speaker 6:  on the watch. He does the, like a camera at the same

420
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,040
Speaker 6:  time he's working on apple park.

421
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,030
Speaker 6:  And in addition to that, you know, forestall is fired

422
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,900
Speaker 6:  and he assumed responsibility for an influence over the

423
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,470
Speaker 6:  software design and the, and the user interface. And all of a sudden

424
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,460
Speaker 6:  has dozens of more employees that he's responsible for. I mean,

425
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,700
Speaker 6:  jobs have kept his, his responsibilities pretty

426
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,690
Speaker 6:  narrow. And in terms of like bureaucratic responsibilities of like

427
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,350
Speaker 6:  HR and managing staff and so on, so forth, because he wanted him to

428
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,980
Speaker 6:  focus on design and, and dreaming up products, Tim cook

429
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,550
Speaker 6:  allowed those things to happen. And also if you talk to people at

430
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,540
Speaker 6:  apple on the creative side, one of their frustrations is that

431
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,440
Speaker 6:  he didn't turn to people who had had a sense of how to

432
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,340
Speaker 6:  work with creatives and either listened to their advice. When they said

433
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,310
Speaker 6:  like, Hey, go buy, like, see Johnny and the design

434
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,970
Speaker 6:  studio work with your talent and recognize that

435
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,870
Speaker 6:  talent has different needs than some of the people you work with in

436
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:27,650
Speaker 6:  an, an operations. And so they were working inside the

437
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,400
Speaker 6:  same company, but really just speaking a totally different language. And

438
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,360
Speaker 6:  that's, and that's where the breakdown is. I, I think there's shared share

439
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,350
Speaker 6:  shortcomings in that. And you're probably right in 2015, if Johnny ive,

440
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,470
Speaker 6:  if you had, if you were the Monday morning quarterback and Johnny ive came

441
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,110
Speaker 6:  to you and said like, look, I'm burned out. I'm tired. I want to leave. The

442
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,200
Speaker 6:  better thing to do is probably just let him go. You're right. But Tim cook

443
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,410
Speaker 6:  was so afraid after taking over the reins of

444
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,370
Speaker 6:  CEO, that the core leadership group that jobs had left

445
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,360
Speaker 6:  behind would abandoned him. That, that, that was something that

446
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,320
Speaker 6:  he was, he just couldn't stomach the idea of Johnny ongoing at the time,

447
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,980
Speaker 6:  people said that he didn't want to be remembered as the CEO who let Johnny

448
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,390
Speaker 6:  ive walk out the door.

449
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,450
Speaker 3:  So the interesting juxtaposition of your book coming out is it's coming out

450
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,440
Speaker 3:  right next to Tony. Fidel's book about building things. If it all was obviously

451
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,280
Speaker 3:  an apple, he was just on decoder last week. And I, I asked

452
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,880
Speaker 3:  him, you know, Steve jobs manage this team of

453
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,540
Speaker 3:  gigantic personalities, right? It's Scott

454
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,320
Speaker 3:  forestall and Tony Fidel, and Johnny. And just down the line, these are huge

455
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,040
Speaker 3:  forceful characters. And you look at Tim Cook's apple,

456
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,020
Speaker 3:  and it's not there anymore. That just feels like the best U2

457
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,990
Speaker 3:  fan club that has ever existed. And they all drive their Aston Martin saran

458
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,920
Speaker 3:  together like that. And that's obviously a very cultivated image. Fidel's

459
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,400
Speaker 3:  point to me was, look, you just don't know about the, the absolute bloodsport

460
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,210
Speaker 3:  politics inside of a big company, unless you see it. But that is the image

461
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,200
Speaker 3:  that Cooke wanted. He did let go of forestall, who

462
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,040
Speaker 3:  was the biggest personality in that team had the most forceful vision for

463
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,970
Speaker 3:  how the software should work. And he has sanded off the rough edges

464
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,330
Speaker 3:  of the company. Do you think that's w I mean, obviously apple is like very

465
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,330
Speaker 3:  successful. So by one metric it's worked, but do you think it's worked?

466
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,200
Speaker 6:  That's what you lost when you lost job jobs, you lost an Uber

467
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,070
Speaker 6:  ego who really enjoyed managing other egos

468
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,820
Speaker 6:  and could do it because, because his word was final and everyone

469
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,780
Speaker 6:  respected him, he was able to kind of balance those things. And

470
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,500
Speaker 6:  what Tim cook saw to create was a more egalitarian

471
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,800
Speaker 6:  world where everybody had a voice and came to some

472
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,610
Speaker 6:  consensus before charting a path forward. And for

473
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:42,270
Speaker 6:  Johnny Ives, that was incredibly disorienting, right? He, he had

474
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,270
Speaker 6:  historically been sheltered from those kinds of conversations. And all of

475
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,840
Speaker 6:  a sudden, somebody with artistic sensibilities and an aversion to

476
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,650
Speaker 6:  conflict was thrust into a world where he had to build

477
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,370
Speaker 6:  consensus to achieve what he wanted to do. It just stood in such

478
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,760
Speaker 6:  contrast to what they were accustomed to. The forced, all of that to me is

479
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,240
Speaker 6:  still fascinating. I don't know what the answer is to this, but, you know,

480
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,200
Speaker 6:  not only had he jostled as Tony Fidel put, it

481
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,040
Speaker 6:  had some sense of bloodsport political bloodsport behind the scenes

482
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,970
Speaker 6:  before job's death. But he was also understood by his peers to be the only

483
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,450
Speaker 6:  one who considered himself to be

484
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,230
Speaker 6:  capable of being the CEO of the company. So Tim cook takes over and who's

485
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,890
Speaker 6:  the first person out the door. It's the only other person who really considered

486
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,850
Speaker 6:  himself potential successor as CEO. I don't know. I mean, I just

487
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,310
Speaker 6:  think that's, that's a really interesting choice.

488
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,470
Speaker 3:  We got to take a break, but when we come back, when I talked to trip about

489
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,650
Speaker 3:  how Tim cook became adept at working over politicians, we were at

490
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,440
Speaker 3:  back,

491
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,050
Speaker 6:  We're back with Tripp Mikel. A big piece of the book is Tim

492
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,770
Speaker 6:  cook having to become a politician. So I would write, he's got to manage

493
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,830
Speaker 6:  all these egos. He's got all this apple stuff, he's handling the internal

494
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,580
Speaker 6:  politics of apple, but then the there's this, the rising pressure for Tim

495
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,330
Speaker 6:  cook to handle actual politics and to be Donald

496
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,470
Speaker 6:  Trump's best friend.

497
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,590
Speaker 5:  Great moment in the book, by the way, when it just like you just like turn

498
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,860
Speaker 5:  the page and all of a sudden it's, it's just like, oh, and then Donald Trump

499
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,340
Speaker 5:  happened.

500
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,060
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Donald Trump happens. There's a trade war in China. There's a

501
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,630
Speaker 3:  moment which is not in the book, but I think is a signature

502
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,960
Speaker 3:  moment of that cook era where that he allows Trump

503
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,650
Speaker 3:  to announce a factory that already exists. And it's just a

504
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,130
Speaker 3:  deadline. Like he's the factor is there before making the same product

505
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:10,120
Speaker 3:  before and Trump got to re announce it, and this is just him learning to

506
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,990
Speaker 3:  play a game that maybe he didn't want to play, but now he has become

507
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,950
Speaker 3:  quite expert at how much of that is you were reporting out, came to the

508
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,790
Speaker 3:  fore that this actually became existential for apple and

509
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,520
Speaker 3:  became more important than butterfly keyboards.

510
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,510
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's, it's, it's there for two reasons because it is existential

511
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,500
Speaker 6:  for apple. And in, in many ways it is more important than the butterfly keyboards

512
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,460
Speaker 6:  it's representative of what Apple's become, which is a two and a half trillion

513
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,040
Speaker 6:  dollar empire onto its own. It's really a geopolitical force in the

514
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,760
Speaker 6:  world, not unlike the U S government or the

515
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,150
Speaker 6:  Chinese government, both are, are dependent on them on

516
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,630
Speaker 6:  apple, the U S government, because it's such a central part of our

517
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,930
Speaker 6:  economy and China, because it employs so many

518
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,680
Speaker 6:  people in China who were working on the iPhones and

519
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,310
Speaker 6:  everything else, my hope and people reading that as they have a deeper

520
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,300
Speaker 6:  appreciation for what apple is today, versus what

521
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,290
Speaker 6:  it was in 2011, when Tim cook first took over, these are, these are

522
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,080
Speaker 6:  the type of concerns that are really taking up his day.

523
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,500
Speaker 5:  There's a certain extent to that. That just seems like it was, it was coming

524
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,960
Speaker 5:  anyway. Like it's, it's a really interesting sort of what have to imagine,

525
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,500
Speaker 5:  like how Steve jobs would have dealt with those same things, because

526
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,390
Speaker 3:  You can't say trip, he just shook his head very

527
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:26,390
Speaker 3:  strongly

528
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,170
Speaker 5:  Because to some, some of them were coming anyway, right? Like I think

529
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,620
Speaker 5:  there's a lot of apple that has sort of led this to happen, like the way

530
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,010
Speaker 5:  that apple decided to work in China and the way that it decided to think

531
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,470
Speaker 5:  about privacy and stuff like that. But like Donald Trump was going to get

532
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,320
Speaker 5:  elected president no matter who was the CEO of apple. Right. And so I think

533
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,040
Speaker 5:  it just is an interesting sort of sliding doors moment to see, like how

534
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,220
Speaker 5:  would that have gone under a different CEO and would they have had to sort

535
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,960
Speaker 5:  of learn how to play the same game? Yeah.

536
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,920
Speaker 6:  There are a lot of people who who've worked closely with Tim and just

537
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,980
Speaker 6:  have complete admiration for the job he's done. And they just think that

538
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,970
Speaker 6:  if, if jobs were in charge of the company probably would be much less valuable.

539
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,940
Speaker 6:  And that, that everything that would've happened in the Trump years would

540
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,900
Speaker 6:  have just been a total fiasco and disaster. So full credit to

541
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,410
Speaker 6:  Tim for being able to, to not only increase the company's

542
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:16,280
Speaker 6:  value financially, but also navigate those

543
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,940
Speaker 6:  political, this choppy political waters that, that he did in that period.

544
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,780
Speaker 6:  And honestly, like that's probably more urgent for the company going

545
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,290
Speaker 6:  forward, you know what they're gonna, what they face and relation to

546
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:31,280
Speaker 6:  China, then whether or not they're going to make a car. I know that's disappointing

547
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,850
Speaker 6:  for listeners of the Vergecast, but that's, I think that

548
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,690
Speaker 6:  speaks to Apple's role in society today

549
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,440
Speaker 6:  and in a way that you would have never imagined it would in the

550
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,430
Speaker 6:  2000 to 2010 Camelot era of apple and all these amazing

551
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,330
Speaker 6:  products.

552
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,760
Speaker 3:  I'm just curious for your read on this. I would say that Cook's ability to

553
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,660
Speaker 3:  manage Trump and China and the trade war and the increasing

554
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,990
Speaker 3:  political scrutiny and regulatory scrutiny of apple on the one hand, his

555
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,860
Speaker 3:  greatest success, right? He's done a masterful job at that. His, his, I

556
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,190
Speaker 3:  think you call it his inherent inscrutability I think is an amazing asset.

557
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,850
Speaker 3:  Do you know what Elon Musk thinks? Do you know what Tim cook thinks you do

558
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,780
Speaker 3:  not? Right. And I think that's an asset for him. On the flip side, there

559
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,560
Speaker 3:  are some values that he's a very clear about, right? He very obviously

560
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,650
Speaker 3:  believes in human rights. He very obviously believes in equality. He came

561
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,830
Speaker 3:  out of the closet publicly to inspire a young

562
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,160
Speaker 3:  people. And then you're like, but you do all this business in China and you

563
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,430
Speaker 3:  just brush the stuff under the rug and that it might have been as great as

564
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,700
Speaker 3:  success, but you could also love you as the greatest criticism of

565
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,630
Speaker 3:  cook that he has made this deal. And he will bend to

566
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:39,180
Speaker 3:  the Chinese government because that's the only path forward. And I,

567
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,240
Speaker 3:  because he's so inscrutable, you don't like, I don't know how he feels about

568
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,780
Speaker 3:  that, but does he like walk the streets at night, like showing

569
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,870
Speaker 3:  contend with this deal that he's made? Or does he just like go to bed on

570
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,220
Speaker 3:  a, on a bed of money?

571
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,850
Speaker 6:  It's, it's impossible to answer without asking Tim directly, you know,

572
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,940
Speaker 6:  about, about how he feels about that. It's not something I was able to get

573
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,780
Speaker 6:  into from people around him. And I think it's

574
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,720
Speaker 6:  become something that's become more pronounced as I've, as I've finished

575
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,500
Speaker 6:  the book, because I think we have a deeper appreciation for the, for the

576
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,430
Speaker 6:  plight of the weaker community in China and the human rights violations that

577
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,060
Speaker 6:  have taken place. That's become more pronounced over the past year, year

578
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,690
Speaker 6:  and a half, not to mention, like we're seeing all these like

579
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,440
Speaker 6:  severe lockdowns in Shanghai and some of the trauma that that's

580
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,100
Speaker 6:  created as well. When it, when it comes to that disconnect

581
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,490
Speaker 6:  between what he says here at home

582
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,450
Speaker 6:  and what, you know, their, their presence and dependency

583
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,900
Speaker 6:  on China, that's going to be the one thing that they're going to really have

584
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,890
Speaker 6:  their feet held to the fire over. Especially if, if there's a change in congressional

585
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,850
Speaker 6:  leadership in the coming in the coming months. And next year, we're already

586
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,750
Speaker 6:  seeing some of that from the FCC and Brendan Carr who's who

587
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,710
Speaker 6:  wrote a pretty critical letter about apple and how it has this position on

588
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,220
Speaker 6:  privacy and how there's a disconnect between that position on privacy

589
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,120
Speaker 6:  and it not allowing voice of America in

590
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,510
Speaker 6:  China because the Chinese government don't want it to be available there.

591
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,960
Speaker 3:  That to me is like very complicated, right? There's a long section in the

592
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,560
Speaker 3:  book about the FBI and encryption, and then the out in that

593
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,220
Speaker 3:  conversation all the time as well. But in China, you just let iCloud be hosted

594
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,610
Speaker 3:  by the Chinese government. Why wouldn't you just let us do that? Why wouldn't

595
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,330
Speaker 3:  you provide us that kind of access? And their answer is always well,

596
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,260
Speaker 3:  because in America we like really respect privacy and we would never let

597
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,530
Speaker 3:  you do this, but in order to do business there, we have to accept the laws

598
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:32,490
Speaker 3:  of the country rent. Right. But you never see Tim cook, like put those

599
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,450
Speaker 3:  ideas together himself. Right? You don't see him say that in the congressional

600
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,160
Speaker 3:  hearing, you don't hear him grapple with the contradiction that

601
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,080
Speaker 3:  I'm just wondering if you think that that, like having done all this

602
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,890
Speaker 3:  reporting when that moment comes, which it might, if

603
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,790
Speaker 3:  Congress flips or there's a new president a few years or anything, Brennan

604
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,660
Speaker 3:  Carr continues, treading angry letters. I know Brendan, that's fine. Well,

605
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,600
Speaker 3:  how do you see the company contending with that? And keeping focus on the

606
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,640
Speaker 3:  stuff that makes wall street happy

607
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,850
Speaker 6:  And it makes water continuing to make the products they need to make, right?

608
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:06,600
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean, you, you're seeing them kind of wrestle with how to deal with

609
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,200
Speaker 6:  that as they try to spin up manufacturing in India and

610
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,740
Speaker 6:  Vietnam and elsewhere, and really struggling with

611
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,370
Speaker 6:  trying to find a way to move on from China

612
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:21,300
Speaker 6:  and diversify their supply chain beyond China. And that's really the only

613
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,630
Speaker 6:  answer. I mean, there, because up to this point, there hasn't been a plan

614
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,630
Speaker 6:  B, but they've got to reduce that dependency.

615
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,380
Speaker 6:  Otherwise, otherwise they're going to continue to run into the type of headaches

616
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,680
Speaker 6:  that they announced in their most recent quarter where they're saying, we're

617
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,500
Speaker 6:  going to have four to $8 billion, less than sales, because

618
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,560
Speaker 6:  there's a COVID outbreak and people can't get into the Shanghai

619
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,400
Speaker 6:  factories. You're looking for something more pointed. Like when is Tim

620
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,330
Speaker 6:  cook going to comment on this? Yeah. I mean, Tim cook is

621
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,230
Speaker 6:  fond of this, this turn of phrase. Often, particularly during the Trump

622
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,560
Speaker 6:  years, you saw it, you know, around immigration where you would, he would

623
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,400
Speaker 6:  say something to the line, to the extent of, I wish Trump would

624
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,370
Speaker 6:  put more heart into this. There's there's a great scene in the book, right?

625
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:07,180
Speaker 6:  Where he goes in to meet with, with Trump as part of this

626
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,990
Speaker 6:  giant CEO meeting, or right before that meeting Axios has a teaser

627
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:14,620
Speaker 6:  story that says, Tim, Cook's going to confront Trump on

628
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,550
Speaker 6:  immigration. And so everybody from the Trump administration comes in

629
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,480
Speaker 6:  there and is like, wide-eyed for this moment when

630
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,050
Speaker 6:  Tim cook is going to challenge Donald Trump about his immigration

631
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,950
Speaker 6:  policy and totally afraid of what Donald Trump's going to say back to

632
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,940
Speaker 6:  him. And they go through the whole meeting, it never comes up.

633
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,780
Speaker 6:  And then as Tim cook is, is leaving, he kind of

634
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,560
Speaker 6:  quietly says to Trump on his way out the door, I wish you put more heart

635
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,370
Speaker 6:  into your immigration strategy. And the next thing everybody

636
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:48,880
Speaker 6:  knew that wound up in Axios. And that was what was kind of

637
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,840
Speaker 6:  broadcast back to the work, you know, back to apple workers,

638
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,600
Speaker 6:  apple customers was Tim cook confronted Donald Trump.

639
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,160
Speaker 6:  But for everybody who witnessed this, this was a far more subtle

640
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,120
Speaker 6:  interaction in subtle episodes than some big squeeze.

641
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,390
Speaker 6:  And that's, that's just his style, right? We're not going to see him come

642
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,960
Speaker 6:  out and say disease, young pain. Like I really wish you would shut

643
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,140
Speaker 6:  down all those weaker camps that you have spun

644
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,590
Speaker 6:  up. And gene Jane, you know, so that we can continue to

645
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,010
Speaker 6:  manufacture stuff. They're such a confrontation. We we'd

646
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,860
Speaker 6:  be naive to think that's ever going to happen.

647
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,830
Speaker 3:  How do you think about the next CEO of apple in that context then?

648
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:30,790
Speaker 3:  Because, you know, he said to Kara Swisher, I think

649
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,750
Speaker 3:  a few months ago, I won't be here in 10 more years. Right? He's already

650
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,960
Speaker 3:  started talking about it. Like there's obviously a succession plan inside

651
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,990
Speaker 3:  of apple. It's what is the most fun game you can play in a podcast? It's

652
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,350
Speaker 3:  talk about who might take over a company, right? It's right. It's right there

653
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,860
Speaker 3:  with casting a movie who would play Johnny. But when you think about the

654
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,430
Speaker 3:  qualifications for the next CEO of apple right now, it is just a

655
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,910
Speaker 3:  company they're not, you're not necessarily in the shadow of Steve jobs.

656
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,570
Speaker 3:  In that way. It is very successful. The products were really successful.

657
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:02,530
Speaker 3:  The services businesses built out. I think a lot of people look and

658
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:05,950
Speaker 3:  they think, oh, this is it's a product person should run this company. But

659
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:09,910
Speaker 3:  the argument you're making is actually you need a politician, you need an

660
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,940
Speaker 3:  operator and a politician to run a company of this size because it is effectively

661
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,470
Speaker 3:  a state unto itself.

662
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,500
Speaker 6:  Yes. And, and that's, what's interesting because the person who's most likely

663
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,070
Speaker 6:  to step into that role, hasn't demonstrated up to this

664
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:25,030
Speaker 6:  point, the type of statesmanship that we've seen from Tim cook,

665
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,540
Speaker 6:  he'd have to develop that that's Jeff Williams, right? I mean, he, he seems

666
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,840
Speaker 6:  to be the successor in waiting. He and Tim cook have worked together since

667
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,780
Speaker 6:  their IBM days. Granted they're, they're, you know, similar

668
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,650
Speaker 6:  in age. So there's, there's that to contend with,

669
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,490
Speaker 6:  but he he's still the most likely successor. The one thing that he

670
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,210
Speaker 6:  has that Tim couldn't didn't have, if he were to fill that

671
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,960
Speaker 6:  role is more product experience because he led the watch

672
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,830
Speaker 6:  product and he's been deeply involved in their healthcare efforts.

673
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,670
Speaker 6:  And he also, before that was, was fairly

674
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:02,360
Speaker 6:  involved in the iPhone. And when Tony Fidel was, was fired from the company,

675
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,050
Speaker 6:  he, he filled Tony Fidel's seat in terms of making some product related

676
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,680
Speaker 6:  decisions on the iPhone. And a lot of people were quite impressed with

677
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,520
Speaker 6:  the degree of savviness that he brought to

678
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,970
Speaker 6:  kind of understanding both the engineering issues that they confronted, but

679
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,750
Speaker 6:  then also some of the design, sensibilities and

680
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,600
Speaker 6:  aesthetic decisions that they were trying to make as well

681
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,260
Speaker 5:  In the realm of thinking about like where apple goes next, the car comes

682
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,740
Speaker 5:  up a bunch in the book, the, the like mythical apple car that either will

683
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,550
Speaker 5:  or won't exist.

684
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,730
Speaker 3:  They just hired a new person. They just hired another Ford executive to run

685
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:38,660
Speaker 3:  the car. It's a real pipeline from Ford to apple, back to Ford. That's

686
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,200
Speaker 3:  what you do

687
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,160
Speaker 5:  And Tesla to. Yeah, it's good. It's great. But so th the car factors in

688
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,760
Speaker 5:  pretty prominently, and then there's this like, great, what if moment

689
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,720
Speaker 5:  where it was going to be the watcher, it was going to be to the TV and it

690
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,380
Speaker 5:  turned out to be the watch. And it's like, it is now my favorite alternate

691
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,620
Speaker 5:  history. Like what if, instead of getting super obsessed with watches, Johnny,

692
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,250
Speaker 5:  I've gotten super obsessed with TVs, but like, as, as we're looking out towards

693
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,310
Speaker 5:  sort of what's coming next, like my first question is, is the car ever going

694
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:07,970
Speaker 5:  to happen? Like if you were a betting, man, is there ever going to be an

695
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:08,870
Speaker 5:  apple car?

696
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:12,770
Speaker 6:  Yes. Okay. And, and the reason I think it'll happen is I

697
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:16,550
Speaker 6:  think they've got to move into a category that big, they just

698
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,300
Speaker 6:  do. I mean, you know, the growth, the growth expectations of wall

699
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,200
Speaker 6:  street will demand that they enter something that new and that ambitious.

700
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,410
Speaker 6:  And we haven't, we've seen them kind of dabbling in healthcare for a long

701
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:31,160
Speaker 6:  time, but we haven't seen them show the ability to, to

702
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,670
Speaker 6:  turn healthcare into a real financial opportunity for the company. Yet I

703
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,390
Speaker 6:  would argue beyond the watch. I mean, that's still the primary income

704
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:39,770
Speaker 6:  stream for healthcare,

705
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,620
Speaker 5:  And Apple's tried pretty loudly with the healthcare stuff like it.

706
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,260
Speaker 3:  Tim cook has said our biggest contribution to the world will be in health,

707
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,380
Speaker 5:  But that doesn't seem to be like, I think you're right. That that is whatever

708
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,090
Speaker 5:  that's going to be. It's not that yet.

709
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:53,150
Speaker 3:  I would say the COVID tracking initiative did not stop COVID

710
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:57,080
Speaker 6:  No, no. I mean, I, how many notifications did you get about your, you

711
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,860
Speaker 6:  know, your close, close brushes with Lyft candidate through that? The one

712
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:04,760
Speaker 6:  thing that the reason I'm, I'm more, I left reporting the book more

713
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,630
Speaker 6:  optimistic about the possibility and potential of a car was

714
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:12,440
Speaker 6:  weirdly because of what they did with apple park and what they pulled

715
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,410
Speaker 6:  off there. I know this is going to sound like a bizarre leap. Why are we

716
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,560
Speaker 6:  going from, from, from cars to, to

717
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,370
Speaker 6:  construction? But the big feat with

718
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:26,270
Speaker 6:  apple park is that they took this

719
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:30,200
Speaker 6:  incredibly ambitious design to make this curve glass that had

720
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,020
Speaker 6:  never been made before in the world. They persuaded a

721
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,010
Speaker 6:  German manufacturer to build a giant warehouse, to make this

722
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,940
Speaker 6:  precisely curved glass. And then in doing so,

723
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,810
Speaker 6:  they not only built this unique building for themselves,

724
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,530
Speaker 6:  but they unlock the possibility that architects and people in

725
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,950
Speaker 6:  construction could start designing things with

726
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,850
Speaker 6:  similar curvature. It's kind of radical to think about the idea that a

727
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:00,600
Speaker 6:  company that makes electronics change the

728
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,440
Speaker 6:  construction and architecture industry in a fundamental way. And so when

729
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,830
Speaker 6:  you think about that and you think about like, auto know, could they jump

730
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,790
Speaker 6:  into the auto industry and change the way that's been done for some time?

731
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:15,660
Speaker 6:  I mean, that's what, that's what makes me optimistic. It's weirdly,

732
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,500
Speaker 6:  it's weirdly the design sensibilities and the design history, which is

733
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,340
Speaker 6:  now, you know, Johnny hives departed. So TBD how that,

734
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,250
Speaker 6:  that manifests itself going forward. But it's the

735
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,820
Speaker 6:  operational sophistication and engineering

736
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,690
Speaker 6:  talent of that company to pull off a feat like they did with a building

737
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,140
Speaker 6:  that makes you, you makes you look at the car thing and be like they could,

738
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,350
Speaker 6:  they came into this, they could do something that nobody else has thought

739
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,310
Speaker 6:  of or done,

740
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:45,000
Speaker 3:  But why are there been so many restarts along the way? Cause this is like,

741
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,330
Speaker 3:  it's their white whale. I agree with you. It's, it's the next biggest market

742
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:52,140
Speaker 3:  that they can enter, but they can't seem to figure out how or why or what

743
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:52,890
Speaker 3:  they should do.

744
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,790
Speaker 6:  It speaks to some of the political bloodsport that Tony Fidelis

745
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:00,780
Speaker 6:  alluding to the book, the book hits on this, but basically at the outside,

746
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,600
Speaker 6:  you had these two competing ideas for what,

747
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,400
Speaker 6:  what the car can be. One of those ideas was there. We just

748
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,210
Speaker 6:  jump in super efficiently and we displaced Tesla with an

749
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,570
Speaker 6:  electric vehicle. And the other idea was, well, if we're going to come

750
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:19,530
Speaker 6:  in, we need to go full autonomy. And Johnny hive was really the one

751
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,440
Speaker 6:  who, who was pushing for that, that idea that we go full

752
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,330
Speaker 6:  autonomy. And this was in the, the kind of

753
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:30,300
Speaker 6:  go-go years where we were all going to be riding around and, and autonomous

754
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,230
Speaker 6:  vehicles. And that's just, I mean, I don't know. You talked to anybody who

755
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:37,830
Speaker 6:  really believed that around 2015, they've given up an

756
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:41,820
Speaker 6:  abandoned hope that that'll ever be a reality until there's a major breakthrough

757
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:45,510
Speaker 6:  in AI, but they were all buying into though the promise and the

758
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:49,200
Speaker 6:  illusion of that in 2015. So that that's been the

759
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,110
Speaker 6:  biggest holdup. That was a major problem.

760
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:55,410
Speaker 3:  It feels like there's a third notion there, which was, we'll just make an

761
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,800
Speaker 3:  electric car. Like Tesla will do this. There's a great scene in the book

762
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,730
Speaker 3:  where Johnny ive does like a fake Siri demo for, for Tim cook with an

763
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,670
Speaker 3:  actress, pretending to be Siri in the car. And that's just nuts.

764
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:09,180
Speaker 3:  Like everyone should buy the book just to read that scene and be like,

765
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:13,020
Speaker 3:  imagine that actually happening, because that is just nuts to

766
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,810
Speaker 3:  me. But then there's like the third option, which is, we'll just make software

767
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:19,020
Speaker 3:  for everyone else's cars, right? And we'll, we'll just colonize all the other

768
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,860
Speaker 3:  cars and apple services will be in them. And they seem to have vacillated

769
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,470
Speaker 3:  between all three of these things. Where do you think they are now?

770
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,830
Speaker 6:  Right now, literally what they're doing is, you know, they have cars rolling

771
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,870
Speaker 6:  around on the streets with these, these mattress pads. I don't know if you

772
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:35,050
Speaker 6:  guys have seen those locally, but there are these mattress pads that are

773
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:39,040
Speaker 6:  on top of the car and they look like giant I-phones in

774
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,850
Speaker 6:  terms of, in terms of what what's driving around. So they're still

775
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:46,810
Speaker 6:  looking to refine the autonomous capability of it. And then I guess,

776
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:50,410
Speaker 6:  combine that with some of the battery pack, sophistication that they've developed

777
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:51,490
Speaker 6:  over the years.

778
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:54,250
Speaker 3:  So you think they're going full autonomous car. So how long do you think

779
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,910
Speaker 3:  that? Do you think it will be God and no one wants to make this bet. This

780
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,130
Speaker 3:  is how you get fired from leading the apple.

781
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,640
Speaker 6:  Thank God. Yeah. We should call the guy at lifts, right? When, when are we

782
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,610
Speaker 6:  gonna all be riding around with cars that

783
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,270
Speaker 3:  I interview a lot of autonomous cars, CEOs on decoder. And they're like,

784
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,600
Speaker 3:  I'm not, I'm not making a prediction, not at this time, but you think they're

785
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,880
Speaker 3:  going to do it. You think they're just going to keep piling money into it

786
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,190
Speaker 3:  and wall, Street's going to let them keep piling money into it.

787
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,860
Speaker 6:  There's no shortage of cash over there. I don't know if you'd noticed that,

788
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,610
Speaker 6:  but I think, I think, I think they can afford

789
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,510
Speaker 6:  to continue to bet on it. I think the bigger question is, and if you

790
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:32,140
Speaker 6:  look back at the tension, it's like, who's going to step into that void

791
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,800
Speaker 6:  and, and provide some direction. That to me was a more

792
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,980
Speaker 6:  interesting thing. When you looked at the car project was, you know, during

793
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,850
Speaker 6:  the jobs era, jobs could come in and, and chart a path forward, and

794
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:46,630
Speaker 6:  everybody could rally behind that in his absence, in this, in this

795
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:50,380
Speaker 6:  age of consensus, you increasingly have conflict without

796
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,410
Speaker 6:  resolution. And that's what I think has been the hangup.

797
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:55,630
Speaker 3:  All right. Well, we are running out of time with you. Thank you for giving

798
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:59,560
Speaker 3:  us so much time. I just to wrap this up, you've now spent a lot of time paying

799
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,680
Speaker 3:  attention to these two figures inside of apple and how the company has

800
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,740
Speaker 3:  worked. What do you think it's biggest? What do you think Apple's biggest

801
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,030
Speaker 3:  challenge right now is

802
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:10,810
Speaker 6:  I think its biggest challenge in this in particular for Tim

803
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:14,740
Speaker 6:  cook is finding his next pair. And then

804
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:17,230
Speaker 6:  when I look back at the history of apple, it's really stunning when you,

805
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:21,040
Speaker 6:  when you analyze it. But jobs built apple with was jobs

806
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,640
Speaker 6:  return and kind of saved apple with eyes. That was his key

807
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,300
Speaker 6:  partner. And then Ivan cook had been key to this

808
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,630
Speaker 6:  past decade and the success that they've had, both in the development of

809
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,990
Speaker 6:  services and the development of, of the watch and AirPods

810
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:38,770
Speaker 6:  category. So who's cooking a team up with now. I mean, if they're pressing

811
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,700
Speaker 6:  issues or China and figuring out how to

812
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,270
Speaker 6:  reduce their dependency on that, that's certainly something that Tim and

813
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:50,110
Speaker 6:  Jeff can work on. Is it, is it Johnny Shruti is, is

814
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:53,980
Speaker 6:  Tim Cook's Johnny really Johnny Srujith. And it's going to be about

815
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,550
Speaker 6:  ships that you can predict how much power is going to improve on

816
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:01,390
Speaker 6:  machines on a given year. And you're going to be more focused on what goes

817
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:05,020
Speaker 6:  inside the machine and how the exterior of a product

818
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,350
Speaker 6:  looks. I mean, that, that seems to be the direction they're heading, but

819
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:12,340
Speaker 6:  identifying that person and, and unleashing their talent is

820
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,340
Speaker 6:  going to be key to the, their ability to get there.

821
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:18,940
Speaker 3:  There's not a lot of chip talk in the book, right? There's not a lot of PA

822
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:22,750
Speaker 3:  semi or Johnny surgery, but this is actually the, the engine of

823
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:26,660
Speaker 3:  apple success over the last two years in particular, is that their chips

824
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,990
Speaker 3:  design, power, performance, power

825
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:33,950
Speaker 3:  consumption, far outpaces the entire industry, their strategy

826
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,700
Speaker 3:  to let TSMC build the chips while they design them, set the model for

827
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,030
Speaker 3:  everybody else. And you know, the Macans having a Renaissance

828
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,270
Speaker 3:  because they've moved to their own chips and they brought them in house.

829
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:47,930
Speaker 3:  If I had to point to one, like here's a criticism, this book is going to

830
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:51,680
Speaker 3:  get it's you it's not in there, right? Why is that? Not in there.

831
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,930
Speaker 6:  This is gets back to the choices that you have to make, right? You know,

832
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,770
Speaker 6:  if you want to, if you want to bring the reader along and keep the focus

833
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:01,700
Speaker 6:  relatively tight, the company that I found myself falling and the

834
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,330
Speaker 6:  issues that Tim cook was most concerned with were

835
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:09,110
Speaker 6:  developing services, right? And then also

836
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:12,980
Speaker 6:  dealing with these extraneous issues of the empire that he

837
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,970
Speaker 6:  had built it's Trump and China. They were less about, about the product and

838
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:20,150
Speaker 6:  where the product was going. And by that point, Johnny was gone. I mean,

839
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:23,930
Speaker 6:  the book does end in 2019. So when you say like the

840
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:27,890
Speaker 6:  last two years, well, the book literally the last page is Johnny

841
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:31,700
Speaker 6:  ive walking out of the door and that was summer of 2019.

842
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,820
Speaker 6:  So you're, you're highlighting a period that the book doesn't cover and these

843
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,530
Speaker 6:  are choices you have to make.

844
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,660
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And there's like one line that you cut out at the end, it was like,

845
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:42,020
Speaker 3:  and then Johnny Srujith peeked over the Bush,

846
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:42,950
Speaker 3:  Johnny,

847
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:45,590
Speaker 6:  The SQL is called new Johnny

848
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:48,890
Speaker 3:  Trip. This has been amazing. The book is really good. We could obviously

849
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:52,220
Speaker 3:  talk for another hour. Like I said, it's going to make everyone mad, which

850
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,460
Speaker 3:  I think is the sign of success for a book like this. Everyone's mad in different

851
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:59,330
Speaker 3:  directions. I have to ask this last question. You're not going to like

852
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:02,900
Speaker 3:  it. You're not going to answer it. But I have to ask this, Johnny, I have

853
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,470
Speaker 3:  the source for the scenes where Johnny ive is standing alone in rooms, contemplating

854
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:07,430
Speaker 3:  his own future.

855
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:10,880
Speaker 6:  I can't get into the sourcing, but you guys

856
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,720
Speaker 6:  know full and well. And it's been hilarious to watch Jonathan Martin and,

857
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,260
Speaker 6:  and, and the guys who just came out with a book on Trump, Theo of these questions,

858
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,040
Speaker 6:  like who gave you the McCarthy audio? It's never who you

859
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,700
Speaker 6:  think it is, right? It just never is. I mean, it's not the obvious

860
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,400
Speaker 6:  person. And that's why people are having a hard time with the SCOTUS thing

861
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,060
Speaker 6:  as well. Who leaked this? Like, nobody's got a clue. It's just

862
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:32,900
Speaker 6:  not,

863
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,740
Speaker 3:  That was a really good deflection. I got lots of well-practiced

864
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,590
Speaker 3:  trip. It's great. I recommend everybody. If you're listening to this show,

865
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,900
Speaker 3:  you're going to love this book. You should go read it. Congratulation trip.

866
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,820
Speaker 3:  It's great. We'll have to have you back on soon.

867
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,710
Speaker 6:  Thanks so much. I appreciate you having me.

868
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,870
Speaker 3:  We gotta take a break, but when we come back, Alex, Cranz join us. Right?

869
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:48,440
Speaker 3:  Gadget lighting

870
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,910
Speaker 3:  around.

871
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,840
Speaker 3:  We're back. Alex Kranz is here. Yeah.

872
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,710
Speaker 9:  Hey, I have no new news about sexy Clippy.

873
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:54,150
Speaker 9:  Sorry.

874
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:56,460
Speaker 3:  All right. There's some gadgets talk about

875
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,920
Speaker 9:  There's a lot. Yeah. There's a lot of gadget news this week.

876
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,520
Speaker 3:  There is, there's a bunch of gadgets, like exciting leaky gadget news. Well,

877
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,060
Speaker 3:  let's start with my favorite Starlink. Yeah. So I got an

878
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,480
Speaker 3:  email and a lot of people got the email. If you're a Starling customer, they

879
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,440
Speaker 3:  will now let you move the dish around wherever you want and use it wherever

880
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,180
Speaker 3:  you want, which is a big step

881
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:15,840
Speaker 9:  Each step.

882
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,380
Speaker 3:  Because before you kind of like, they start like divides the world into like

883
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,370
Speaker 3:  little hexagon shapes and you were hexagon is where you could be.

884
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:27,300
Speaker 3:  And if you left it, you got in trouble tonight. You can go to any hexagon

885
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:27,660
Speaker 3:  you want

886
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,870
Speaker 5:  As someone who has never used Starlink define trouble, like what, what would

887
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,210
Speaker 5:  happen if you previously tried to move,

888
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:36,120
Speaker 3:  They would shut you down. Oh, okay. Like first it wouldn't work. And then

889
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,240
Speaker 3:  if you try to move it on the website too many times, they would like catch

890
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,640
Speaker 3:  you and you, so you weren't allowed to like, change your location on the

891
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,880
Speaker 3:  website too many times because they were just protecting the network. None

892
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,490
Speaker 3:  of this is nefarious. They're just like, right. But they've launched a bunch

893
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:51,180
Speaker 3:  of new satellites. I think they have the capacity now. So they're enabling

894
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,270
Speaker 3:  portability, which means you can take it anywhere. Here's the, here's the

895
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:56,760
Speaker 3:  rub $25 a month.

896
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,970
Speaker 9:  Oh, are they they're waiving that fee? I assume in

897
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:01,830
Speaker 9:  Ukraine,

898
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:05,700
Speaker 3:  I don't know it, starlets pricing is like, they've raised the fees for everyone

899
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,690
Speaker 3:  else. So they went from 90 to 110 for the base service. And

900
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:13,110
Speaker 3:  now if you want to move around with Starlink you're at a year at another

901
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:17,040
Speaker 3:  25, so $135 for your portable startling

902
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,220
Speaker 3:  experience, you still can't like put it on a car, which I think a lot of

903
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,350
Speaker 3:  people want to do, but anywhere you are in a service area, if you pay the

904
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:25,870
Speaker 3:  extra fee, you can set the thing down on the point itself to the sky and

905
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:26,530
Speaker 3:  go,

906
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,310
Speaker 5:  And am I right in thinking that Starlink has said, it's working on the, like,

907
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,310
Speaker 5:  you can use it in motion thing. Cause that seems like that's pretty clearly

908
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:36,460
Speaker 5:  like the thing it ought to be is that it just works.

909
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,270
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Again, the technical limitation of Starlink every

910
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:44,250
Speaker 3:  time is that even a single utility pole

911
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:48,070
Speaker 3:  will degrade your service, but one tree

912
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:51,520
Speaker 3:  will do great. So yeah, you're driving around. But like if you drive next

913
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,580
Speaker 3:  to a tall car, you drive next to a satellite truck,

914
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:57,000
Speaker 9:  Like any 18 Wheeler,

915
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,250
Speaker 3:  Like you're hooped. So I think there's, there's a little bit of that for

916
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,060
Speaker 3:  them to, to yet figure out. I'm pretty sure the answer is like all things

917
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,810
Speaker 3:  Starling is more satellites. Like Tony stark style, like a suit of

918
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:09,190
Speaker 3:  armor around the world.

919
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:12,580
Speaker 9:  The just going to follow you. The satellites will just like, be like drones.

920
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:16,510
Speaker 9:  I think we just need to put satellites on drones. That's the next star link.

921
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:20,110
Speaker 3:  They're launching more satellites. They're opening more service and they've,

922
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:22,930
Speaker 3:  this is a big step for them because this is the thing you were not allowed

923
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:26,830
Speaker 3:  to do before. And when we reviewed it, I actually tried to give it to Monica

924
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:30,640
Speaker 3:  where she had bad internet service at her parents' house. And Starlink was

925
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,210
Speaker 3:  like, what are you? The police are coming stop. And actually part of the

926
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:37,090
Speaker 3:  thing that people got mad at me, and they were used like, I, you know, my

927
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,510
Speaker 3:  house, I've got big trees. So to test it in a place where the

928
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:44,260
Speaker 3:  installation worked, drove down the street to where there were no trees.

929
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,750
Speaker 3:  And so then the criticism is, well, you were out of your service area. And

930
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:49,900
Speaker 3:  I was like, I was just down the street, but now for $25 a month, I can make

931
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,770
Speaker 3:  that criticism go away. So watch out Starling fanboys, I'm

932
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,330
Speaker 3:  paying the money and come and free

933
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:56,800
Speaker 9:  Riverview.

934
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,760
Speaker 5:  I find this super exciting, like as someone who does not have any need

935
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,360
Speaker 5:  whatsoever in my life for Starlink, because I have, I mean, I was going to

936
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,020
Speaker 5:  say fast internet, but as Liam, our producer can attest. It's not fast, but

937
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:11,770
Speaker 5:  it's internet at home. And it works fine. Like the, the appeal of Starlink

938
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:15,310
Speaker 5:  has never actually hit me as a person. But like now startling, it goes from

939
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:18,790
Speaker 5:  like thing you get, if it's your only way to get internet, because you're

940
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,000
Speaker 5:  somewhere far with bad connectivity or no connectivity to

941
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,780
Speaker 5:  like it now does things that my Comcast internet

942
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:29,590
Speaker 5:  connection, won't like, I can take it with me on vacation, which is like

943
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,410
Speaker 5:  a meaningful, real thing that I think is kind of cool.

944
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:35,140
Speaker 9:  Does it, your phone also do that though.

945
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:38,650
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But if 5g was real, this would be X 5g would be cool and

946
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,720
Speaker 5:  exciting,

947
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,380
Speaker 3:  Right? It certainly doesn't have data caps yet. They're not doing like, they

948
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,650
Speaker 3:  are a better, they're still an ISP and they, in their terms of service have

949
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:51,130
Speaker 3:  reserved the right to do all the bad things. Right. You do too much

950
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:54,430
Speaker 3:  torrenting. Starlink is looking at your path or your packets and they will

951
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:57,580
Speaker 3:  shut you down for copyright infringement, just like anybody else. But right

952
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,830
Speaker 3:  now I'm not doing any of it. I think the question is, does the network have

953
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:03,580
Speaker 3:  capacity? And also traveling with Starlink is

954
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:07,420
Speaker 3:  like, it's an unwieldy and complicated thing. Like there's a dish.

955
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,380
Speaker 3:  There is a power injector box. There's its own custom router. That's all

956
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:15,370
Speaker 3:  a lot, you know? So like you're trying to take

957
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:18,190
Speaker 3:  Starling through the TSA. Like let me know. Cause I want to be there on that

958
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:22,040
Speaker 3:  day. Like if you have an RV or you're like doing van life, I

959
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,450
Speaker 3:  think this is like ideal.

960
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:27,320
Speaker 9:  I was like, those chick talks of people building their vans so they can live

961
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,680
Speaker 9:  off the grid. So excited for the Starlink episodes. Now,

962
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,250
Speaker 3:  Notable verge, ex-pat Evan Rogers, building a van and his Instagram right

963
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,120
Speaker 3:  now. It's pretty

964
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,520
Speaker 9:  Good. Will he put Starlink in it?

965
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,680
Speaker 5:  Probably knowing Evan, like that's coming,

966
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,050
Speaker 3:  We'll get it. We'll get them to review startling on the road. Next lightning

967
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:45,740
Speaker 3:  round item. This is actually really cool. So you can now play

968
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:49,430
Speaker 3:  fortnight on iPhone or Android in the browser, through

969
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:53,330
Speaker 3:  Xbox cloud gaming, which is like the browsers, the out for all of these

970
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:56,480
Speaker 3:  services and all this in app purchase stuff. It's pretty cool that you can

971
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,020
Speaker 3:  do it.

972
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:00,350
Speaker 9:  And this was like, after epic, pretty notoriously didn't want to work with

973
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:03,560
Speaker 9:  Microsoft for a long time because their competitors and they were like, we

974
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:07,370
Speaker 9:  don't want you to, like, we compete with you. We don't want our stuff on

975
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,910
Speaker 9:  your services. And then they're like, oh, in this

976
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:13,940
Speaker 9:  particular instance, this is a win for both of us. And Microsoft gets still

977
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,320
Speaker 9:  a very magnanimous.

978
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,380
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It was like an enemy of my enemy is my friend moved this one pretty

979
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:22,100
Speaker 5:  clearly. Like they both have a lot to gain from

980
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,980
Speaker 5:  screwing up this whole app store thing apple has going on.

981
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,970
Speaker 5:  And this is like a pretty, it's a pretty good way to

982
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:32,750
Speaker 5:  do it. Actually. They're like it's in the browser. It works. It's fortnight

983
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,750
Speaker 5:  magic.

984
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:37,100
Speaker 9:  One of my favorite things is how Microsoft has just been egging everybody

985
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,030
Speaker 9:  on in this whole like saga and the, you know, they

986
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:44,990
Speaker 9:  have, they have their stake. Like they want an Xbox cloud gaming app. They've

987
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,990
Speaker 9:  tried repeatedly to do it. They can't, they're doing the browser. And so

988
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:50,750
Speaker 9:  instead they're like just being friends with everybody else and being like,

989
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:54,080
Speaker 9:  you know, that's right. That would be cool. We should be able to have our

990
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:54,680
Speaker 9:  apps.

991
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,750
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And they're putting out an open letter as being like we're the most

992
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,670
Speaker 3:  open company except for the Xbox. Yeah.

993
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:02,090
Speaker 9:  Is wondering like I just, I love X-Box. It's just like, don't, don't, don't

994
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:03,290
Speaker 9:  pay attention to that side of things.

995
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:07,250
Speaker 3:  So, but you wonder, right. Epic versus Google is

996
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:10,340
Speaker 3:  marching right along. You have to think, Google's going to be like, well,

997
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,000
Speaker 3:  why is this a problem? You can just play it in the browser. I'm Microsoft

998
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,910
Speaker 3:  platform. Look at how competitive this is. If you're a Google's

999
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:19,850
Speaker 3:  lawyers and you just had that thought just now, I don't know what you're

1000
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:23,060
Speaker 3:  like. You should come on

1001
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,850
Speaker 3:  already. That should be first on your list when you seniors like this. But

1002
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,490
Speaker 3:  I imagine we're going to hear this argument. So there's a little bit of like

1003
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:31,280
Speaker 3:  games has been shipped inside an announcement. Like

1004
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,760
Speaker 9:  It's a counter to that. I like, I know the counter in this room would be,

1005
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,420
Speaker 9:  well, have you played things on the browser versus an app? Like

1006
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:41,870
Speaker 9:  what's the legal counter besides being like, judge, judge, please play

1007
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:44,900
Speaker 9:  fortnight on an app right now while we watch.

1008
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,990
Speaker 3:  So for apple, the counter to all the browser stuff was apple nurse, the

1009
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:51,110
Speaker 3:  browser, which is not really an argument you can make about

1010
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:54,770
Speaker 3:  Google, right? Because there's other rousers available. You can, you don't

1011
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:58,580
Speaker 3:  need to use the Chrome engine on Android phones. You can download other browsers

1012
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:01,370
Speaker 3:  with other browser engines. So there's a lot. I think that case is going

1013
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:04,370
Speaker 3:  to be the much more interesting one compared to apple. Apple is interesting.

1014
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:07,580
Speaker 3:  Cause you got, you know, Tim cook on the stand and the judge was yelling

1015
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:10,880
Speaker 3:  at him and like the goo Hayes is like, that's all deals,

1016
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,300
Speaker 3:  right? Licenses, Android, the deals have the

1017
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:18,230
Speaker 3:  control embedded in the language of them. So like, I think there's more to

1018
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:21,180
Speaker 3:  come from that case. I don't think the safari team is like

1019
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:25,020
Speaker 3:  writing a contract with the Astro team. Like that's

1020
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:28,890
Speaker 3:  how Android works. Like they have a contract with Samsung and with the carriers

1021
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:32,550
Speaker 3:  and like all this stuff. So we shall see Chris Welch

1022
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:36,390
Speaker 3:  continues to just ruthlessly scoop the Sonos team about this new

1023
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,710
Speaker 3:  thing, the Sonos, right.

1024
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:41,340
Speaker 9:  Nothing left for the actual announcement. They'll just refer to the verge.

1025
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,770
Speaker 3:  I hope they don't go crazy. I think actual an answer. And they're like, it's

1026
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:47,430
Speaker 3:  actually a TV. And like Patrick Spence like pulls up. He's

1027
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,690
Speaker 3:  like,

1028
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:52,020
Speaker 5:  It's a projector screen that pulls up out of the soundbar.

1029
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:52,830
Speaker 3:  Exactly.

1030
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:55,920
Speaker 5:  It's actually a good idea. I'm just going to say like a screen that pulls

1031
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,110
Speaker 5:  up out of your soundbar. It's a pretty good idea.

1032
01:02:58,110 --> 01:02:59,490
Speaker 3:  It's a tiny little screen,

1033
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:03,180
Speaker 5:  But like short throw projector in my soundbar throws up on the, on the pull

1034
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,480
Speaker 5:  up screen, like the used to have in middle school. This is a good idea. I

1035
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,050
Speaker 5:  just, I just invented something.

1036
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:12,030
Speaker 9:  The name Sonos Ray. It could be a short throw projector,

1037
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:15,990
Speaker 9:  just like Ray is, is kind of a silly name. Paul used to everyone named

1038
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:19,830
Speaker 9:  Ray, listening to this Ray for the name of a soundbar is a silly

1039
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:23,730
Speaker 9:  name. Add like maybe it's beaming rays of

1040
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:27,090
Speaker 9:  light onto a short throw projector screen. Yeah.

1041
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:30,330
Speaker 3:  Well it's 250 bucks and supposed to go on sale in a matter of weeks. But

1042
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:34,080
Speaker 3:  the more interesting piece that also Chris Welch league, they're going to

1043
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,830
Speaker 3:  introduce their own voice assistant, which is fascinating.

1044
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:41,040
Speaker 3:  So as you know, Sonos and Google are tied up in patent

1045
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:45,030
Speaker 3:  litigation all started when Sonos wanted

1046
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,960
Speaker 3:  Alexa and Google assistant to operate simultaneously. Amazon

1047
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,750
Speaker 3:  doesn't care because they're the winner. But Google

1048
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:55,530
Speaker 3:  apparently said no, like very vociferously

1049
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:59,010
Speaker 3:  that led to patent litigation Patrick's fence and the chief legal office

1050
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:02,670
Speaker 3:  of Sonos or on decoder talking about it. But you can see they're like, we'll

1051
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:06,180
Speaker 3:  just do our own to do the things we want to do. So in order to extend your

1052
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:10,110
Speaker 3:  platforms, there are building this home theater or us there's job listings

1053
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:14,070
Speaker 3:  for it. But here's a really funny thing about this. So Sonos voice will

1054
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:17,460
Speaker 3:  be on all S two Sonos devices that have

1055
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,760
Speaker 3:  microphones. So it will support apple music, Amazon music,

1056
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,720
Speaker 3:  Pandora, Deezer, obviously these are hockey teaser. And

1057
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,680
Speaker 3:  then Sonya says on this radio that Spotify and YouTube music are

1058
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:32,100
Speaker 3:  not on board. And it's like, well, yeah, obviously YouTube music is

1059
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,300
Speaker 3:  not

1060
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,580
Speaker 5:  So close.

1061
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,750
Speaker 3:  Spotify is a big one.

1062
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:40,650
Speaker 9:  Yeah. It was like maybe YouTube, like get it. People will survive

1063
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:43,560
Speaker 9:  as Spotify. That's a, that's a really big one to not have on there.

1064
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,530
Speaker 5:  Spotify is an interesting one in that range actually, because Spotify has

1065
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:50,160
Speaker 5:  its own voice search thing that it obviously has

1066
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:54,030
Speaker 5:  incentives to get people to use. But also Spotify has been pretty open

1067
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:57,630
Speaker 5:  in working inside of this space. Like Spotify connect is very

1068
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:01,260
Speaker 5:  good. It's everywhere my guests would be. And I have

1069
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,660
Speaker 5:  absolutely no inside knowledge on this, but my guess would be that, that

1070
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:07,080
Speaker 5:  is a like a timing thing rather than a philosophical

1071
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,050
Speaker 5:  difference because it, unless there's something we don't know about this

1072
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:13,950
Speaker 5:  voice assistant, it seems very surprising to me that Spotify would not be

1073
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:14,640
Speaker 5:  interested in being part

1074
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,100
Speaker 3:  Of it. Or Spotify wants its voice assistant on there too, maybe. Right. Cause

1075
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,410
Speaker 3:  like, you know, Sonos is like, we'll have Siri on there. If Hafele would

1076
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:23,770
Speaker 3:  let us Netflix like no, no, no, no you

1077
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:25,570
Speaker 3:  don't.

1078
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:27,280
Speaker 9:  You don't want Siri on your speaker

1079
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,270
Speaker 5:  Already exists to be launched by accident on my computer while I'm downstairs.

1080
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:32,470
Speaker 5:  That's a serious here.

1081
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,890
Speaker 3:  My current serum moment is I've I've installed a smart garage door

1082
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:39,790
Speaker 3:  opener. It's very fancy. So I leave the house and I say, close the garage

1083
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:43,270
Speaker 3:  in Siri on my watch. It's just like I'm working on

1084
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:46,630
Speaker 3:  it. And it actually says that

1085
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:49,510
Speaker 9:  It's the worst thing in the world.

1086
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:53,350
Speaker 3:  This is, this is the dumbest thing that you can do as a computer. You close

1087
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:56,860
Speaker 3:  a relay. It's all doing like the box is

1088
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:00,760
Speaker 3:  very, it actually patches into the switch itself and

1089
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,120
Speaker 3:  just closes the wire. Like it's not a complicated,

1090
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,750
Speaker 5:  I'm just imagining serious, like a very tiny person hanging from your garage

1091
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,890
Speaker 5:  door being like, come on,

1092
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:14,350
Speaker 3:  I'm working on it. I'm going to just like, like, like a dark

1093
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:19,490
Speaker 3:  brown.

1094
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:21,550
Speaker 3:  And then about 50% of that's private sales.

1095
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:22,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's it.

1096
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,360
Speaker 9:  Whenever they, whenever she says I'm working on it, you're like, oh, I'm

1097
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,450
Speaker 9:  just going to have to say this in 20 minutes. Once you finish working on

1098
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,070
Speaker 9:  it and failing.

1099
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:33,850
Speaker 3:  But it's funny. Cause it, Siri, it suggests all these like very

1100
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:37,720
Speaker 3:  optimistic automation routines. Like when we detect that

1101
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,500
Speaker 3:  you've come home and we're paired to the car, we'll open the

1102
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,980
Speaker 3:  garage for you. And I'm like, you can't, you don't, you can't open the garage.

1103
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:48,940
Speaker 3:  Like I don't, What do you think you're to that's like me saying,

1104
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:52,240
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna run a marathon. Like I'm definitely not going to do that.

1105
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,930
Speaker 9:  I had her set up so where she was supposed to, whenever the camera

1106
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:59,500
Speaker 9:  detected motion and I wasn't home, it would turn all the lights

1107
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,250
Speaker 9:  red and sing that song. I'll be watching you to really creep,

1108
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:06,730
Speaker 9:  freak out. Whoever had snuck into my home. It only

1109
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:08,590
Speaker 9:  activated when I would get

1110
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:12,550
Speaker 9:  home. It wouldn't like the trigger that

1111
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:15,580
Speaker 9:  I was home would come later. So it'd be like, I'm watching you. And I'm like,

1112
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:19,290
Speaker 9:  no, I, I know something's wrong. Know?

1113
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:22,600
Speaker 3:  Oh no, she don't know this way. I have to write. I'm obligated to remind

1114
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,410
Speaker 3:  you that Siri on our show, isn't it. We do not gender robots on the

1115
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:27,010
Speaker 3:  Vergecast

1116
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,750
Speaker 9:  Sorry. I apologize.

1117
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:32,670
Speaker 3:  It only comes up because Amazon is so insistent on gendering Alexa.

1118
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:33,520
Speaker 3:  It's like

1119
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,160
Speaker 9:  They don't have their robots.

1120
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,290
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And not very smart ones.

1121
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:39,950
Speaker 9:  They're very stupid.

1122
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:43,630
Speaker 5:  I have a question at this sunup. Thanks. So I think w like leaving

1123
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:47,590
Speaker 5:  aside, whether Sonos can do this in a way that is good, which I

1124
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:51,580
Speaker 5:  would say given Sonos is software experience is just an absolute

1125
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,910
Speaker 5:  coin flip who knows. Sometimes soreness does cool stuff. Sometimes it's a

1126
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:58,870
Speaker 5:  total disaster coin flip. We'll see. I think this is a

1127
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:02,590
Speaker 5:  very good idea. Both for like strategic reasons, because Sonos is

1128
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:06,550
Speaker 5:  just going to like middle finger, Google and apple and Amazon

1129
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:10,120
Speaker 5:  and everybody else who doesn't work with them. But also because my, my like

1130
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,450
Speaker 5:  longstanding thesis about voice assistants is that

1131
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:16,940
Speaker 5:  actually we should have lots of them. And not just one,

1132
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:20,930
Speaker 5:  like I want to, I want to talk to my TV by talking to my TV, not

1133
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,830
Speaker 5:  by talking to Alexa about my TV. And I think like Roku has worked

1134
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:28,220
Speaker 5:  on this in the past. And to be honest has changed his plan so many times

1135
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,070
Speaker 5:  that I have no idea what Roku is doing with voice assistants anymore. But

1136
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:34,280
Speaker 5:  I think this idea that Sonos is like, okay, you want music? Talk to Sonos,

1137
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:38,060
Speaker 5:  don't talk to Alexa about Sonos. Talk to Sonos. I actually think is a

1138
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:41,000
Speaker 5:  really good idea for a bunch of reasons. Especially as they want to get people

1139
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,510
Speaker 5:  like used to the idea of using its products in lots of different places.

1140
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:46,790
Speaker 5:  So they can pull this off. I actually think it's going to be really smart

1141
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,280
Speaker 5:  and music assistance work. They're good. Yeah.

1142
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:53,240
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And I also think they have a great pie. So I know they've told us,

1143
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,330
Speaker 3:  they've told everybody they make products that microphones because oh, a

1144
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:59,750
Speaker 3:  huge segment of customers do not want microphones and everything. Right.

1145
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:03,500
Speaker 3:  Because privacy implications. So if you're Sonos and you're like this

1146
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,460
Speaker 3:  isn't Amazon, this isn't, whatever else this is us. And what it does is it

1147
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:11,390
Speaker 3:  plays music, which is the thing you want to do. They throw in multiple timers,

1148
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:12,920
Speaker 3:  like, Ooh, watch out

1149
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,360
Speaker 9:  Giving you the weather, like

1150
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:18,320
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Bezos, your empire will crumble. Yeah. But maybe not even the weather,

1151
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,470
Speaker 3:  like maybe it's just that the things that people do is just set

1152
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:24,920
Speaker 3:  timers and play music. And they're like, this is what we do. And it's

1153
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,700
Speaker 3:  private. And you know, we're not going to sell you ads or we're not going

1154
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,910
Speaker 3:  to pop up and say like, have you heard about the games? Like, we're just

1155
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:34,670
Speaker 3:  going to do the two things. Very smart question is, are they gonna make you

1156
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:35,420
Speaker 3:  pay for it?

1157
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,830
Speaker 5:  Oh, that's interesting question.

1158
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:37,820
Speaker 9:  I hate that question.

1159
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:40,550
Speaker 3:  Like, is this like a premium Sono subscription situation?

1160
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:43,790
Speaker 9:  I mean, that makes a lot of sense for them looking for like additional revenue

1161
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:47,720
Speaker 9:  streams. Like everybody wants that consistent $5 a

1162
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,360
Speaker 9:  month. These customers all have money to pay like

1163
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,100
Speaker 3:  Right. Who doesn't love recurring revenue.

1164
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,860
Speaker 5:  Well, and especially as they're going to start to, like, if they're going

1165
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,770
Speaker 5:  to make headphones and they have these Bluetooth speakers, like being the

1166
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:01,520
Speaker 5:  thing that stitches everything together is Sonus this whole thing. And

1167
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,390
Speaker 5:  then add on to that, like this amazing control system. I could absolutely

1168
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:06,620
Speaker 5:  see them charging for that.

1169
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:10,040
Speaker 9:  I feel like there's two things that will make this kind of dead on

1170
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,880
Speaker 9:  arrival, not having Spotify. Yeah. Like that's a huge

1171
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:17,840
Speaker 9:  one. And also the fact that if you already have other smart assistants

1172
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,080
Speaker 9:  in your home, you're now having competing smart assistants and you have to

1173
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,290
Speaker 9:  remember their names and remember to activate the right one at the right

1174
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:28,010
Speaker 9:  time. Maybe that's just a me dead in the water thing, but I will

1175
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:31,010
Speaker 9:  forget the names immediately. I will absolutely call Siri what I mean to

1176
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:34,340
Speaker 9:  call sodas and the other way around. Cause I do it with my dog and my brother

1177
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:38,210
Speaker 9:  now, like when one of them isn't even as

1178
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:41,600
Speaker 9:  like a human being, I will mess it up constantly.

1179
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,390
Speaker 3:  I think I'm with David. I think that's just timing just given historically

1180
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:47,990
Speaker 3:  or Spotify or Spotify demanding that they get their weird voice thing on

1181
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:51,380
Speaker 3:  there too. We'll see. This Chromebook seems

1182
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,290
Speaker 3:  amazing.

1183
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,820
Speaker 9:  It's amazingly expensive,

1184
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:57,140
Speaker 3:  But I'm like down with the thousand dollar Chromebook.

1185
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:00,980
Speaker 5:  So I added this one to the rundown and that's the exact conversation I

1186
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:04,070
Speaker 5:  want to have because this has been tried a bunch of times. And as far as

1187
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:07,760
Speaker 5:  I can tell this, this new Chromebook, which is it's called the HP

1188
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,900
Speaker 5:  dragon fly the

1189
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:11,660
Speaker 9:  HP elite dragon fly you're

1190
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:15,090
Speaker 5:  Right. I apologize. As the elite dragon

1191
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:19,050
Speaker 5:  fly, it has high-end chips. It has Intel's V pro platform. It

1192
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:22,710
Speaker 5:  gets super bright. It has an HTMI port. It's like, it's a, it's a whole ass

1193
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:26,610
Speaker 5:  computer and it starts at $1,149. And I think the

1194
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:29,940
Speaker 5:  question I have been wondering for years is like,

1195
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:33,840
Speaker 5:  will anyone want to pay this much money? Even for the

1196
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,770
Speaker 5:  best imaginable Chromebook? And I'm actually really excited for, at the

1197
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:39,030
Speaker 5:  idea that we're going to find out

1198
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:42,960
Speaker 9:  They didn't do it with the pixel book. Why would they do it? What's the difference

1199
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,100
Speaker 9:  between this and the pixel book?

1200
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,500
Speaker 3:  Well, the principal principle was a little shaky. It was like a little too

1201
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:50,280
Speaker 3:  much. Right. But I will say this, I bought my

1202
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:54,240
Speaker 3:  mom a Chromebook pixel. It was a thousand dollars and

1203
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,750
Speaker 3:  it is the single best technology purchase I've ever made because you do not

1204
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:01,680
Speaker 3:  have to support that thing. Yeah. It sounds web browser. And there's all

1205
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,130
Speaker 3:  the other stuff that Chromebooks can do now. Like they have, you can run

1206
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:08,250
Speaker 3:  Android apps for some godforsaken reason that hopefully Dieter will figure

1207
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:12,090
Speaker 3:  out, Hey buddy. But like, it's just a web browser and you

1208
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:16,080
Speaker 3:  like hand somebody, a beautiful laptop that isn't like, have

1209
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,040
Speaker 3:  you heard about services, revenue we've opened the, the apple TV

1210
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:23,850
Speaker 3:  app is on your laptop for summer. Like none of that. No,

1211
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:26,820
Speaker 3:  no windows guard. It's just like, here's a web browser, but it's

1212
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:30,600
Speaker 3:  beautiful. Like it did still. My mom's like primary

1213
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,630
Speaker 3:  computer year and this is years now. Like maybe five years, she's still using

1214
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:36,480
Speaker 3:  this thing. Am I call it? It's timed upgrading. Like, here we go. You're

1215
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:40,380
Speaker 3:  an elite dragon fly. Now mom, you're a real game.

1216
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:44,130
Speaker 5:  Oh God, if only it wasn't called the elite dragon fly.

1217
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:47,940
Speaker 9:  I do love that this is the first one that's kind of like had a

1218
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:51,660
Speaker 9:  really good display or sounds like it has a really good display. We haven't

1219
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:54,630
Speaker 9:  seen it in person, but a thousand nits.

1220
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:57,000
Speaker 9:  Like that's, that's nice.

1221
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,880
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The Pixelbook had those bezels. I wasn't even about to put those bezels

1222
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,420
Speaker 3:  near my mother. I respect her. She's a brilliant and accomplished woman.

1223
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:07,230
Speaker 9:  I tried to say that I liked the bezels and as I get older, I'm like, why

1224
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:09,930
Speaker 9:  didn't I say that? I was like, it's good for my fingers when I'm interested

1225
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:11,250
Speaker 5:  Too liked the bezels.

1226
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:14,040
Speaker 9:  When I was in tablet mode, it was really nice. I played a lot of fallout

1227
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:18,000
Speaker 9:  shelter on the pixel book and it was great for that.

1228
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,780
Speaker 9:  And that's it. That's

1229
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:19,920
Speaker 5:  A wild take.

1230
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,730
Speaker 9:  And then I tried to put fuchsia audit and broke it. So

1231
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:27,390
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I'm definitely going to buy this. I can see it coming.

1232
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:30,420
Speaker 5:  And this is like a thing. There's a, there's a, these are starting to trickle

1233
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:34,290
Speaker 5:  out these computers that are like very good computers that ordinarily like

1234
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:38,190
Speaker 5:  could have run windows one day and now are running chromo. S and I

1235
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:41,730
Speaker 5:  feel like if I'm Microsoft, that's real bad news, but as a person who loves

1236
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:43,380
Speaker 5:  Chromebooks, I think that's super exciting.

1237
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,360
Speaker 3:  It's just an <inaudible>.

1238
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,770
Speaker 9:  Oh yeah. That's it's,

1239
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:47,880
Speaker 5:  It's a Chromebook.

1240
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,480
Speaker 9:  I mean, it doesn't need a lot, but also, yeah, it's an

1241
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:55,110
Speaker 9:  <inaudible>. I think it even has less, it has not a lot of

1242
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:58,770
Speaker 9:  storage. Eight gigabytes of Ram, 128

1243
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:02,100
Speaker 9:  gigabytes of storage. So for the same price, you can

1244
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,320
Speaker 9:  get a Mac book.

1245
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,290
Speaker 3:  Yeah. With the Mac book, we'll like the Mac book. We'll just like, find ways

1246
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:10,410
Speaker 3:  for Tim cook to ask you for money. And like the slightest provocation

1247
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:13,990
Speaker 9:  Mac book. I mean, I got my one over Christmas and the

1248
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:17,950
Speaker 9:  calls about that. I get, I feel I'd still do it

1249
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:21,520
Speaker 9:  with the Chromebook, but that's just because my mom's annoying, but like

1250
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,700
Speaker 5:  The iCloud troubleshooting for me, I control the shooting.

1251
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,550
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Well she doesn't, she doesn't want anything. And she's like, I don't

1252
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:28,780
Speaker 9:  want anything in the cloud.

1253
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:32,770
Speaker 3:  No one has ever cared about anything in my life. As persistently, as my Mac

1254
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:36,460
Speaker 3:  book has cared about turning on wifi calling, It's just like, I

1255
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:39,930
Speaker 3:  don't, I do not wish to ever receive phone calls on this.

1256
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:43,810
Speaker 3:  It's like, we stopped So

1257
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,100
Speaker 9:  Persistent.

1258
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:48,010
Speaker 3:  All right. Last one. This is like leaks week.

1259
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:48,910
Speaker 5:  It was,

1260
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:52,090
Speaker 3:  And this leak actually blew up. So the Sony's got new

1261
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:55,060
Speaker 3:  headphones. Yeah. I always get the name wrong.

1262
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:57,790
Speaker 9:  The w H dash

1263
01:14:57,790 --> 01:14:59,800
Speaker 3:  1000 X MH five.

1264
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,110
Speaker 9:  No, it just X, M I think

1265
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:04,240
Speaker 5:  The age fives are the earbuds.

1266
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:08,170
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I always get this mixed up. Anyway. I have the XM twos

1267
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:11,710
Speaker 3:  and they're great, but the battery's starting to go and every year I'm like,

1268
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:14,650
Speaker 3:  should I get the XM three? Should I get the XM four in like, no, cause they're

1269
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:17,710
Speaker 3:  the same headphones, but these are appreciably different. We'll just call

1270
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:19,450
Speaker 3:  them editors.

1271
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,320
Speaker 9:  Yeah.

1272
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,710
Speaker 3:  So these are still, these were my go-to airplane headphones and I stopped

1273
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:27,490
Speaker 3:  wearing, or my X, M twos were my go-to

1274
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:29,500
Speaker 3:  airplane headphones. And then I stopped flying airplanes, but now I'm on

1275
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,650
Speaker 3:  airplanes again. And I'm like, oh, the noise canceling. Like noise-canceling

1276
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:36,610
Speaker 3:  technology has improved dramatically. Yeah. So I'm in it. But

1277
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:40,180
Speaker 3:  Sony saw as a problem like everybody else does. If you have an iPhone, you're

1278
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:43,510
Speaker 3:  stuck with whatever apple that you do. So you can't do high quality audio.

1279
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:47,470
Speaker 3:  You can't do on press. Like you're just kind of stuck at apple sound quality

1280
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:51,130
Speaker 3:  situation, which I am sure the next versions of the

1281
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:55,030
Speaker 3:  AirPods will overcome in some proprietary way. And like, you just have to,

1282
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:57,130
Speaker 3:  you just have to look into your heart and be okay with that.

1283
01:15:57,130 --> 01:16:00,460
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And truthfully, I think for most people, the, like the thing that Sony's

1284
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:04,270
Speaker 5:  have going for them, which is stupendously long battery life. If,

1285
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:06,820
Speaker 5:  especially if this leak is true and it's 40 hours, like that's, that's a

1286
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:10,510
Speaker 5:  crazy number, really good noise cancellation. They're super comfortable.

1287
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:13,600
Speaker 5:  Like, that's the thing about the Sonys that always gets me is just the

1288
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,070
Speaker 9:  They're like little clouds.

1289
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:19,030
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I can just wear them for like a eight hour journey and it

1290
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:22,750
Speaker 5:  doesn't feel bad, which I love. And I also think their, their

1291
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,480
Speaker 5:  microphone is really good, which is a thing that it's possible. I am the

1292
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,900
Speaker 5:  only person on earth who cares about, but matters to me a lot. Yeah. I'm

1293
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,840
Speaker 5:  very excited about these zones, especially if they have, like, the new design

1294
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,530
Speaker 5:  is a little sleeker, it has kind of a little sort of candy cane

1295
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:39,220
Speaker 5:  looking thing, attaching the bands to the cups instead of just being like

1296
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:42,220
Speaker 5:  all band and yeah. I, these Sonys, I think have

1297
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:46,090
Speaker 5:  consistently been the best noise canceling headphones

1298
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:49,210
Speaker 5:  for a bunch of years now. And the, the XM five

1299
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:52,540
Speaker 9:  Since the <inaudible>. Yeah, right. Like I got the

1300
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:55,570
Speaker 9:  <inaudible> I love them. I wore 'em to Taiwan and

1301
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:59,440
Speaker 9:  back, like with my glasses on, which is normally like a recipe

1302
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:03,430
Speaker 9:  for pain. Totally comfortable. It was great. I mean, 14 hour flight

1303
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:07,320
Speaker 9:  wasn't but the rest was really great. Like, yeah. They,

1304
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:11,210
Speaker 9:  they just, and the noise canceling, like the way Sony does noise

1305
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:14,870
Speaker 9:  canceling and their approach to it where they don't kind of, the sound

1306
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:18,380
Speaker 9:  profile is still, they still maintain quality of the sound profile. Whereas

1307
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:22,370
Speaker 9:  Bose goes really flat. Apple goes really just expensive. Nobody

1308
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:25,340
Speaker 9:  wants to buy the apple ones. Cause they're, I don't even know how they sound

1309
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:25,680
Speaker 9:  because they're

1310
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,020
Speaker 3:  Still heavy and weird.

1311
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:27,950
Speaker 9:  Yeah. And like, these

1312
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:29,940
Speaker 3:  Are like, yeah,

1313
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:33,860
Speaker 9:  These are clouds. These are clouds that shut off the airplane

1314
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:36,860
Speaker 9:  for you, but still gets you where you need to go.

1315
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:40,460
Speaker 3:  I haven't tried new Bose ones. I have quiet comfort twos and they're so bad

1316
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:43,070
Speaker 3:  at low end symbol. To me,

1317
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:46,700
Speaker 5:  I have the, the QC 40 fives, which are not like the highest end one, but

1318
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,240
Speaker 5:  are pretty recent ones. And it's exactly the same thing. Like I, I love the

1319
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:53,240
Speaker 5:  way they sound. I love the way they feel. And if it is like, if it's been,

1320
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:57,080
Speaker 5:  if it has been breezy in the last five days, my headphones will

1321
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,690
Speaker 5:  sound like trash. And it sounds like I am blowing away in a

1322
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:01,370
Speaker 5:  storm.

1323
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:02,540
Speaker 1:  It's awful.

1324
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:05,900
Speaker 5:  Otherwise, they're great though. But no, I think that like, yeah, these Sonys

1325
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:08,780
Speaker 5:  are very exciting and I'm absolutely convinced that if they had a better,

1326
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:12,740
Speaker 5:  more memorable name, they would have absolutely already eaten the headphone

1327
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:16,640
Speaker 5:  market alive. But because no one can go Google them and find them.

1328
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,320
Speaker 5:  We still have to tell people they exist. Yeah.

1329
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,530
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I do this for a living. I still can't say the product name correctly.

1330
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,200
Speaker 3:  All right. We want, we talked, we spent a long time talking about trip medical.

1331
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:28,070
Speaker 3:  So we are officially over on the verge cast. Once again, Alex, thank

1333
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,960
Speaker 3:  had Tony Fidel. It was a real, a real ride. And then obviously

1334
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,660
Speaker 3:  the Fidel conversation and the mythical conversation got started, like play

1335
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:42,560
Speaker 3:  off each other, Fidel, by the way, there's some people who are like

1336
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,260
Speaker 3:  actively and aggressively. Fact-checking his conversation with me on Twitter

1337
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:49,640

1341
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:01,760
Speaker 9:  the first guys who started selling keyboards online. Like people were selling

1342
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,820
Speaker 9:  keyboards online, but he was selling them on Kickstarter, making his own

1343
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:08,720
Speaker 9:  keyboards. And we kind of talked about where the spaces and how we got
