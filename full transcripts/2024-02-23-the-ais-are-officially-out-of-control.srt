Speaker 6:  Hello

19
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:04,375
Speaker 4:  Alex. Cranz is here. Hello. Quite a lot of news

20
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:08,615
Speaker 4:  going on in the world of ai. This section is labeled in the rundown as

21
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:12,495
Speaker 4:  the AI is going insane y'all. So we've got a lot to talk about there.

22
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:16,305
Speaker 4:  And then not one, but two lightning rounds today

23
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:20,715
Speaker 4:  we're still on the, on the hunt for lightning round sponsors. Heron The,

24
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:21,515
Speaker 4:  Vergecast. Two

25
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:22,515
Speaker 6:  Opportunities today.

26
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,475
Speaker 5:  I was hoping there was gonna be like some audio just then. Just some like

27
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:29,275
Speaker 5:  lightning noises. Yeah. But there was more of like a PPE P. That was my lightning

28
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,475
Speaker 5:  noise in my head just now.

29
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:32,635
Speaker 4:  Like a, like a DJ horn? Yeah,

30
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:33,515
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah.

31
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:38,195
Speaker 4:  If you. If you sponsor Wedding Round. I will say your name and play a DJ

32
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:40,035
Speaker 4:  Horn sound effect.

33
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:41,075
Speaker 5:  It's compelling

34
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:44,515
Speaker 4:  You, you can do it, you just have to email Liam at The Verge dot com

35
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:49,355
Speaker 4:  with a picture of your money and we'll take it from there. Yeah,

36
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,435
Speaker 4:  I think that's how sales work. I don't know. I'm not an influencer. Alright,

37
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:56,395
Speaker 4:  let's talk about the ai. It is a little out of hand what is happening with

38
00:02:56,395 --> 00:03:00,005
Speaker 4:  the, the large language models out there on the internet. There's some news

39
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:03,765
Speaker 4:  though, some actual news today in the world of AI that I think is very important.

40
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:08,365
Speaker 4:  We just talked a lot about how AI is rewiring the internet,

41
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:12,845
Speaker 4:  how the incentives to make new content on the open web are

42
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:16,125
Speaker 4:  changing because the AI companies are training on that data. There's all

43
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,845
Speaker 4:  kinds of lawsuits and recriminations. And then in the middle of it,

44
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:24,125
Speaker 4:  Reddit announced a deal with Google today where Google is gonna train its

45
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:28,005
Speaker 4:  AI systems on what Steve Huffin, the CO of Reddit keeps

46
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:31,485
Speaker 4:  referring to as the Reddit corpus. Oh. Which is

47
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:35,485
Speaker 4:  a great, this is honestly a great academic word, but I think If, you walked

48
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:38,925
Speaker 4:  up to the average Reddit user and was like, today you've contributed to the

49
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:41,205
Speaker 4:  Corpus. I don't know it would land.

50
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:42,805
Speaker 5:  No, it

51
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,365
Speaker 4:  Wouldn't. Welcome to the corpus. Oh,

52
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:47,165
Speaker 5:  I don't wanna be there. Take me out. Take me out.

53
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:51,285
Speaker 4:  I love the Vision Pro Sub corpus. That's how I

54
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:54,005
Speaker 4:  think about Reddit. This is a huge deal though.

55
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:58,005
Speaker 6:  It is, and I think it's kind of the

56
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:02,965
Speaker 6:  end, or if not the end then almost the end of this very long road that

57
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:06,685
Speaker 6:  Reddit has been on, where Reddit kind of belatedly discovered

58
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:10,685
Speaker 6:  that the best business it has is it is a source of amazing data

59
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:14,365
Speaker 6:  on everything and that it has become like a known

60
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:18,205
Speaker 6:  hack that If, you want to Google something and get good human

61
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:21,085
Speaker 6:  based information, you just add Reddit to the end of it and it will dump

62
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:24,485
Speaker 6:  you into a subreddit where inevitably people are discussing whatever you

63
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:28,245
Speaker 6:  wanna talk about and it's helpful. Reddit has been fighting with

64
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:32,365
Speaker 6:  OpenAI about this. Reddit has been sort of loosely threatening

65
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:36,325
Speaker 6:  to go public for like three years now. And the

66
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:40,125
Speaker 6:  idea now, I think we're sort of assuming Reddit is gonna file its

67
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:44,165
Speaker 6:  S one to officially go public any day now. So you've

68
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:47,445
Speaker 6:  gotta figure that Reddit was desperate to make a deal for a lot of money

69
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:50,925
Speaker 6:  to be like, look how important Reddit is. And it opens up

70
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:55,285
Speaker 6:  just an infinite number of messy side

71
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:58,965
Speaker 6:  effects and sort of knock on situations that we should talk about.

72
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:03,485
Speaker 6:  But I think a, the fact that it's this much money, which is a

73
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:03,645
Speaker 6:  lot.

74
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,085
Speaker 4:  Wait, is it? Yeah,

75
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:06,685
Speaker 5:  It's 60 million a year.

76
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:08,165
Speaker 4:  60 million a year.

77
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:09,845
Speaker 6:  That's a lot of money.

78
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:13,085
Speaker 5:  I mean for Google, that's like a sneeze.

79
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:14,445
Speaker 4:  Sure.

80
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:15,565
Speaker 6:  Reddit is not Google.

81
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. For Reddit it probably is

82
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:23,005
Speaker 6:  A decent, so Reddit's, Reddit's revenue, the last few years, I'm, I'm

83
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:26,605
Speaker 6:  gonna, you know, I average a bunch of real numbers is somewhere in the range

84
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:30,525
Speaker 6:  of like $450 million a year. Okay. So that's

85
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:34,325
Speaker 6:  a big jump in revenue for one deal for your data.

86
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:38,045
Speaker 6:  That in theory doesn't change anything else. And this also means Reddit can

87
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:41,365
Speaker 6:  go and demand a similar deal from OpenAI. Like you've gotta figure

88
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:45,125
Speaker 6:  every one of these companies is going to try and make a bunch of these deals.

89
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,405
Speaker 6:  Because if you're Reddit, you're saying, well, if Google has our data and

90
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:52,445
Speaker 6:  OpenAI doesn't, Google has a real leg up and so they're gonna make the

91
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:55,405
Speaker 6:  same kind of offer to OpenAI, they're gonna make the same kind of offer to

92
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:59,365
Speaker 6:  Anthropic. Like you can see a world in which pretty quickly a

93
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:02,885
Speaker 6:  third half of revenues coming to Reddit comes from these deals.

94
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:04,685
Speaker 6:  That's big money.

95
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:08,325
Speaker 4:  So, I have a lot of questions about this. I think

96
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:12,005
Speaker 4:  $60 million is almost an existential number for the internet.

97
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:17,005
Speaker 4:  If, you Google, you desperately need people

98
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:21,405
Speaker 4:  to put new information on the web where Google search can find

99
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:24,565
Speaker 4:  it. The incentives to do that right now

100
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:29,525
Speaker 4:  with any amount of quality are dying. Are near zero. Yeah.

101
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:34,005
Speaker 4:  Like zero. Like the, the most effective thing you can do on the web today

102
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:38,125
Speaker 4:  is either set up an e-commerce website so you can get people to buy stuff

103
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:42,045
Speaker 4:  without paying Apple transaction fees. I know this because the

104
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,205
Speaker 4:  CEOs of Wix and Squarespace and all these other companies come on decoder

105
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:49,565
Speaker 4:  and I say, why should anyone make a website? And they say e-commerce. Right.

106
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:53,565
Speaker 4:  Every time. That's why people make websites. Now, the other reason to make

107
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:57,405
Speaker 4:  a website is to do SEO hum. Content marketing

108
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:01,965
Speaker 4:  for dental practices or whatever else. Nonsense that happens, right? It's

109
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:05,525
Speaker 4:  a game Google, because you're doing content

110
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,085
Speaker 4:  marketing for some eCommerce website like that. Those are the things Yeah.

111
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:13,205
Speaker 4:  If, you happen to search like just something dumb. Like how

112
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:16,845
Speaker 4:  do you install a baby seat in a car? You get car dealership

113
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:18,045
Speaker 4:  websites because that, that's why

114
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:18,445
Speaker 5:  You type in

115
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:22,285
Speaker 4:  Reddit. That's why you type in Reddit. Yeah. So if you're Google and you're

116
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:25,645
Speaker 4:  like, well, the incentives we made for the web have turned the web into garbage,

117
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:29,925
Speaker 4:  we should make sure Reddit continues to exist. And the value

118
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:32,925
Speaker 4:  you place on that deal is $60 million.

119
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:38,365
Speaker 4:  I would argue that's not nearly enough because for Google

120
00:07:38,595 --> 00:07:42,045
Speaker 4:  it's nothing that is a percentage of the money they're paying Apple just

121
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,945
Speaker 4:  to be the default search engine. And I I that I

122
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:49,705
Speaker 4:  get it that the Reddit's not big, but when Reddit's the only good

123
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:52,945
Speaker 4:  result in Google, it feels like that number should be much harder. I think

124
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:53,185
Speaker 4:  it's like

125
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,945
Speaker 5:  Reddit probably didn't push hard enough, right? Like they kind of had Reddit

126
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:57,465
Speaker 5:  over a barrel.

127
00:07:57,755 --> 00:08:01,745
Speaker 4:  Right. Reddit has no leverage. Yeah. Against the noise. Because Google can

128
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:04,985
Speaker 4:  also be like, we're also just taking everything. Yeah. Which is what OpenAI,

129
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,985
Speaker 4:  I should have done So. I just, there's something in that number. I don't

130
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:11,825
Speaker 4:  know. I think we got to wait for the actual S one that we gotta see Reddit's

131
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,465
Speaker 4:  actual financials when it actually becomes a public company. All that is

132
00:08:14,465 --> 00:08:18,445
Speaker 4:  yet to be discovered. But you just see this number and

133
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:21,565
Speaker 4:  it's like Ooh, that's not nearly enough. If you're the last place,

134
00:08:22,575 --> 00:08:26,165
Speaker 4:  human beings actually answer questions in the internet in a way that's

135
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:27,685
Speaker 4:  discoverable to search engines.

136
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:30,885
Speaker 6:  Let me offer the flip side of that argument. Yeah. Which is that maybe Reddit

137
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,845
Speaker 6:  is the only company with leverage in these arguments. Yeah. Which is

138
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:38,205
Speaker 6:  that Google knows, I I guarantee you

139
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:41,925
Speaker 6:  firsthand Google knows how important Reddit is

140
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:45,965
Speaker 6:  to the business of Google search, the fact that Reddit's search product

141
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:49,805
Speaker 6:  is bad. And so people don't just go to Reddit and search, they go to Google

142
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:53,645
Speaker 6:  and search Reddit is a lot of money for Google. Like

143
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,805
Speaker 6:  no one at Google is unclear about how important Reddit results

144
00:08:57,945 --> 00:09:01,005
Speaker 6:  are to its business. Yeah. And Reddit has been

145
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:05,565
Speaker 6:  loudly fighting against OpenAI and others. They were early to block

146
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:09,645
Speaker 6:  the GPT bot to not let OpenAI crawl its stuff. So if not

147
00:09:09,745 --> 00:09:13,605
Speaker 6:  Reddit, then who, if, if Reddit can't come in

148
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:17,005
Speaker 6:  and say, you actually need our data more than we need to be part of your

149
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,645
Speaker 6:  system, that doesn't deliver any value back to us anyway.

150
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:22,755
Speaker 6:  Who can say that?

151
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,755
Speaker 4:  I agree with you, but I think the important part of this puzzle is that for

152
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:30,715
Speaker 4:  Google search to exist, it needs to create a

153
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:35,225
Speaker 4:  situation in which there are 10,000 Reddits. And right

154
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:37,385
Speaker 4:  now it has created a situation in which there is, but won

155
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,065
Speaker 6:  And maybe not even one for long.

156
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:42,105
Speaker 4:  And you know, maybe not even one for long, but there, there's a bunch of

157
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:43,025
Speaker 4:  forums like

158
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:47,105
Speaker 4:  NELI is gonna complain about his own theater system. Again, You ready for

159
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:51,065
Speaker 4:  this. Yeah. I have a hot ass Sony receiver. It's brand new. I love it.

160
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:54,945
Speaker 4:  It's easy. 3000 es I could talk about it all day night. When you turn on

161
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:58,665
Speaker 4:  its core feature, it makes a hissing sound. I hate that.

162
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,865
Speaker 4:  I, I'm in, I'm in the forum, I'm on that AAV s forum thread. I know

163
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:06,385
Speaker 4:  what's going on. I called my dealer and I sent him links to the AVS Forms.

164
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:11,345
Speaker 4:  But that's like a huge problem, right? That the company that runs a BS

165
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:15,265
Speaker 4:  forum is small. It's not big Google. There's

166
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:18,665
Speaker 4:  no, there's not some huge set of

167
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:22,825
Speaker 4:  home theater websites that are finding me this information,

168
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:27,065
Speaker 4:  right? It's a bunch of people who bought this one extremely sick

169
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:31,025
Speaker 4:  product that has this one problem that are talking about it in a form

170
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:34,945
Speaker 4:  and Google has to find it. And if Google extracts value from

171
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:38,865
Speaker 4:  that and delivers me an AI summary of that thread and says, call this number

172
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:42,305
Speaker 4:  and this firmware patch or whatever, then that forums

173
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,865
Speaker 4:  need to then Google's extracting value from that company without giving you

174
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:49,065
Speaker 4:  back. And that can happen to a thousand companies. It can happen to just

175
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,505
Speaker 4:  Reddit. But you just, this cycle,

176
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:55,875
Speaker 4:  this is the first time we've got a number of what Google thinks this is worth.

177
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,435
Speaker 4:  Right? And this cycle that we're in, I think is gonna either push that number

178
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,395
Speaker 4:  way, way down, which is very bad, or it will result in more

179
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:07,115
Speaker 4:  and more people demanding ever bigger numbers because there's nowhere else

180
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:10,595
Speaker 4:  for Google to get the raw data it needs to function from.

181
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:14,995
Speaker 4:  And you put all that in the context of Reddit,

182
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:18,515
Speaker 4:  which just pissed off a bunch of its users, but shove that in the rear view

183
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:21,795
Speaker 4:  mirror as fast as it could. Yeah. Because it needs to be a real company that

184
00:11:21,795 --> 00:11:25,275
Speaker 4:  makes money. And they were like, fine. And I think the, the company has come

185
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:28,195
Speaker 4:  through that. We should talk about that at length in the context of this.

186
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:32,355
Speaker 4:  But that's Reddit on the other side of that is Google. And

187
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,595
Speaker 4:  Google has to look at all of these lawsuits, New York Times versus

188
00:11:36,815 --> 00:11:40,355
Speaker 4:  OpenAI Getty versus stability. We'd go down the list and every time Google

189
00:11:40,355 --> 00:11:44,275
Speaker 4:  makes a deal like this, all it is doing is signaling the

190
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:48,195
Speaker 4:  world, oh, there's money here, there should be money here. And

191
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:51,795
Speaker 4:  all of those lawsuits get more and more expensive. And I, I just look at

192
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:55,605
Speaker 4:  this and I'm like, oh, this is the beginning. This is the end of the

193
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:57,085
Speaker 4:  beginning of this phase. Right. but it

194
00:11:57,085 --> 00:12:00,445
Speaker 5:  Is like, it's explicitly for ai, it's not for the search part of it. Like

195
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:01,325
Speaker 5:  Google still has

196
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:05,845
Speaker 4:  No, they Reddit search is gonna be vertex, Google's Vertex AI now.

197
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,765
Speaker 4:  Oh. So there's gonna be a Google powered AI search in Reddit now, which is

198
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:12,325
Speaker 4:  cool. Yeah. Okay. I feel like Redditers are gonna have a lot of feelings

199
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:14,885
Speaker 4:  about that once that rolls out actually inside of Reddit.

200
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:18,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm curious to see if it works. Like I,

201
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:22,805
Speaker 5:  I think Google's kind of internal website searches Yeah. Aren't nearly

202
00:12:22,865 --> 00:12:24,965
Speaker 5:  as powerful. Oftentimes we,

203
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:28,205
Speaker 4:  I mean, so said one of the proprietors of The Verge dot com, which has a

204
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,445
Speaker 4:  Google powered website. Yeah.

205
00:12:29,725 --> 00:12:33,525
Speaker 5:  I just, not always, it's fine, but it's not always like, great,

206
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:37,325
Speaker 5:  I don't know. I I, I, I know how the Reddit one works. I'm like, nah.

207
00:12:37,905 --> 00:12:40,925
Speaker 4:  Can any robot contend with the corpus of Reddit? Yeah.

208
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:42,045
Speaker 5:  Hmm. No.

209
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:45,765
Speaker 6:  Probably nor can any human or any group of humans. But no, I think

210
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,165
Speaker 6:  the flip side of this, I think is that Google is also

211
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,765
Speaker 6:  desperately trying to figure out how to get the AI nonsense out of

212
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:58,685
Speaker 6:  search, which in theory makes Reddit even more

213
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:02,365
Speaker 6:  important to Google over time. So not only does Google

214
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:06,685
Speaker 6:  ha ship this money to Reddit, it actually has,

215
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:10,805
Speaker 6:  I would argue, a stronger incentive than ever to push Reddit

216
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:14,245
Speaker 6:  search results to the top of search results. And one of the things that happened

217
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:17,965
Speaker 6:  in this deal is that Reddit is now giving Google programmatic

218
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:21,965
Speaker 6:  access to things like conversations

219
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:25,925
Speaker 6:  that are moving very quickly and are really interesting or comments and post

220
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:29,325
Speaker 6:  counts and all the kind of underlying metadata that you don't get just by

221
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:32,765
Speaker 6:  scraping a page once a day or once an hour or whatever. And

222
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:37,005
Speaker 6:  by being able to actually like pipe Reddit into Google,

223
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:40,365
Speaker 6:  I think if I'm Steve Huffman, not only am I betting that you're gonna write

224
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:44,165
Speaker 6:  me a check for $60 million a year, you're going to have more and

225
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:48,245
Speaker 6:  more reasons over time to highlight Reddit stuff in Google search

226
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:53,165
Speaker 6:  when most things are being driven down because it's all turning into

227
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:53,765
Speaker 6:  AI crap.

228
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:56,125
Speaker 4:  Isn't that worth way more than $60 million?

229
00:13:56,465 --> 00:14:00,325
Speaker 5:  No. What my question is that feels like a bad, like Reddit already has

230
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:04,005
Speaker 5:  struggled to monetize its traffic, right? It's really bad at

231
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:07,765
Speaker 5:  monetizing its traffic. And so now if it gets more traffic and it's only

232
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:11,725
Speaker 5:  getting $60 million a year, that actually feels like a bad

233
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:16,045
Speaker 5:  gamble for, for Reddit because now I, I can't monetize the in increased traffic

234
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:18,525
Speaker 5:  and instead it's just gonna increase server fees.

235
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:22,205
Speaker 4:  Here's what I'll say. I don't think we know the answer. I am desperate to

236
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:25,805
Speaker 4:  know what our listeners think. Yes. This is like a great hotline prompt.

237
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,525
Speaker 4:  Who do you think is the winner of the seal? Is it Google or is it Reddit?

238
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,525
Speaker 4:  Because I think Reddit is a big winner. And I think over time Google

239
00:14:33,745 --> 00:14:37,685
Speaker 4:  is staring down the barrel of its demise because it used

240
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:41,245
Speaker 4:  to be the internet used to be search and social. Those were the two great

241
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:45,045
Speaker 4:  traffic sources. And If, you could tell if a publication was

242
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:48,885
Speaker 4:  organized around search or if it was organized around social because the

243
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:52,605
Speaker 4:  ones that were organized around social were insane. Just to be blunt,

244
00:14:53,355 --> 00:14:56,845
Speaker 4:  like If, you were like, I'm Optimiz. I've optimized this website for Facebook

245
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,485
Speaker 4:  traffic. You'd be like, I hope you're okay. Like, I hope,

246
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:02,325
Speaker 4:  I hope you're having a good day just

247
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:03,645
Speaker 5:  Putting mayonnaise on a countertop.

248
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:05,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's just straight. It's just like, here's what we do. We're gonna

249
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:09,205
Speaker 4:  get a watermelon. We wearing, get two guys in lab coats and we're put rubber

250
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:12,125
Speaker 4:  bands in the watermelon and then everyone will have to sit around talking

251
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,565
Speaker 4:  about what that means. This is a real thing. We lived through

252
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:19,635
Speaker 4:  Buzzfeed was worth over a billion dollars because it was organized around

253
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:23,435
Speaker 4:  social media in that way. If, you take Google and you say, our

254
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:27,395
Speaker 4:  search product, like David is saying, it's now organized around real time

255
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:31,315
Speaker 4:  social conversations on these various platforms. Something

256
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:35,025
Speaker 4:  very different is gonna happen. And I I that there's,

257
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:38,905
Speaker 4:  there's a conflation there of what used to be search and social into one

258
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:42,865
Speaker 4:  kind of thing. And I think that means Google is now hopelessly dependent

259
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:46,505
Speaker 4:  on social platforms to be good at things like getting rid of ai,

260
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:50,585
Speaker 4:  to be good at doing things like, like

261
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:54,185
Speaker 4:  centering human conversations in real time versus

262
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:58,745
Speaker 4:  the AI chum that we all live in on the web every day. I don't know, I don't

263
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:01,825
Speaker 4:  know. I just, I'm just seeing the beginning of a dependency for Google that

264
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:05,745
Speaker 4:  is not great, but maybe, maybe actually this is gonna improve Google

265
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:07,385
Speaker 4:  search in a way that we'd all like it to improve

266
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:10,785
Speaker 5:  Anytime the power swings. I'm delighted. And it feels like right now the

267
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:14,065
Speaker 5:  power is swinging perhaps away from Google and it's

268
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:17,265
Speaker 5:  bajillion g named AI services.

269
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:21,265
Speaker 6:  It's just not clear who it's swinging to. Right. I think that's the strangest

270
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:21,705
Speaker 6:  part. Yeah.

271
00:16:21,705 --> 00:16:23,585
Speaker 5:  It's just swinging. Yeah.

272
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:27,345
Speaker 6:  It just feels like it's, it's just sort of dangling in the

273
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:31,225
Speaker 6:  air right now and it's like, who is going to be the next powerful thing?

274
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,225
Speaker 6:  And it's just so not clear.

275
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,145
Speaker 4:  And it's The Verge dot com where just a series of blog posts

276
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:41,105
Speaker 4:  about expensive receivers, I believe will save the media.

277
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:41,625
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

278
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,865
Speaker 5:  That's it. That's all you need. It

279
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:46,145
Speaker 4:  Has this feature called 360 spatial Sound Mapping. It's so cool. It it just

280
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:46,465
Speaker 4:  lists

281
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,865
Speaker 5:  Who sneaks up behind you in this.

282
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:51,985
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna make a list by the way of Atmos tracks where the guitarist is

283
00:16:51,985 --> 00:16:53,305
Speaker 4:  sneaking up behind you. Yeah.

284
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,225
Speaker 5:  Just guitarists.

285
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,985
Speaker 4:  I have Well all of them feature a precaution is sneaking up behind you. Okay.

286
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:01,905
Speaker 4:  No one has any other ideas. you know that, you know that website TV

287
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:05,625
Speaker 4:  tropes? Yeah. I could make one today called Spatial Audio

288
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:09,625
Speaker 4:  Tropes. And Guy with Morocco behind you is

289
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:12,705
Speaker 4:  number one on the list. Like, is there like

290
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:17,265
Speaker 4:  percussive enhancement to a song? Yeah. Like a fill or an

291
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:17,865
Speaker 4:  accent, just

292
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:19,305
Speaker 5:  A little castane coming behind

293
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,105
Speaker 4:  You. Get back there

294
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:22,625
Speaker 5:  Just creeping up.

295
00:17:22,895 --> 00:17:26,865
Speaker 4:  Just goodbye. You, you wanna do a hi hat Phil, back in the

296
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:27,305
Speaker 4:  room, buddy.

297
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:32,985
Speaker 4:  Just every day. Yeah. I think about the song Fade

298
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,705
Speaker 4:  Into You by Maie Star is a spatial audio travesty.

299
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:39,985
Speaker 4:  I'm just telling you, you should

300
00:17:39,985 --> 00:17:40,505
Speaker 5:  Do a review of it

301
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:43,985
Speaker 4:  In spa that is a very small in It's a beautiful, I love that song.

302
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:48,025
Speaker 4:  It's a very small intimate track, right? Yeah. In

303
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,325
Speaker 4:  spatial audio it's like, what if these motherfuckers were all around

304
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:56,285
Speaker 4:  anyway, sorry. Show 360 spatial sound mapping. Yeah.

305
00:17:56,305 --> 00:18:00,165
Speaker 4:  It listens to speakers in your room and it re it moves them to their ideal

306
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:04,005
Speaker 4:  placements. Okay. It's very cool. That is cool. This is a completely

307
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:06,805
Speaker 4:  irrelevant product for anyway. Google. Percent of the audience

308
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:11,125
Speaker 4:  power moving Google. Good, good Alex.

309
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:15,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah, Google. They, they got all those, those companies with cheese

310
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:15,365
Speaker 5:  names,

311
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:17,645
Speaker 4:  They have all those companies with G names. Here's the thing about the ai,

312
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:22,485
Speaker 4:  all of this presumes that these systems work and work well and work reliably.

313
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:26,485
Speaker 4:  Mm. Which has not been the case this week. David,

314
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:27,765
Speaker 4:  can you run us through it? Oh

315
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:30,245
Speaker 6:  No. I was really afraid you were gonna ask me. I feel like I'm gonna get

316
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:33,325
Speaker 6:  canceled just by a attempting to explain what's going

317
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:36,685
Speaker 4:  On. Here's the reason I asked the whitest man on this podcast to, to do this.

318
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,205
Speaker 6:  That's fair. Okay. So

319
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:39,965
Speaker 4:  You can

320
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,565
Speaker 6:  Now use Gemini to generate images.

321
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:47,045
Speaker 6:  And what appears to have

322
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:47,365
Speaker 4:  Happened

323
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:52,125
Speaker 6:  Is that Google went out of its way to make

324
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,405
Speaker 6:  sure that those images being generated would be diverse

325
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:59,845
Speaker 6:  and not fall into the same biases that we've seen from a lot of image

326
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:03,565
Speaker 6:  generators over time, which tend to basically prey on

327
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:07,645
Speaker 6:  like the lowest basis stereotypes in really ugly ways.

328
00:19:07,825 --> 00:19:11,045
Speaker 6:  So Google seems to have gone out of its way to go the other way and be diverse

329
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:14,965
Speaker 6:  in its representation of all things. Some people got very mad because

330
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:18,525
Speaker 6:  then when you start doing things like, say, show me a picture of some

331
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:22,325
Speaker 6:  Nazis, it shows you a substantially more diverse set of

332
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,405
Speaker 6:  Nazis than you might expect to see.

333
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,445
Speaker 4:  But it's very funny that we made you say this out loud. Yeah. Because I hate

334
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:30,365
Speaker 4:  it shows you like black and brown Nazis. Yeah.

335
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:33,925
Speaker 5:  It was definitely like a poster. It was just like the biggest

336
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:38,365
Speaker 5:  educational poster that you might see in a, in a, in a like fake diversity.

337
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:42,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Like, like a fake diversity poster you see at certain companies

338
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:46,125
Speaker 5:  and like you're like, oh, that's not real. And now

339
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:46,765
Speaker 5:  they're Nazis.

340
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:50,325
Speaker 6:  It's the group of friends sitting on the quad on the front of every college

341
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:50,925
Speaker 6:  brochure.

342
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:51,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

343
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:53,965
Speaker 4:  That's true. I just wanna be very clear that when I attended the University

344
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:57,805
Speaker 4:  of Wisconsin Addison, it got into trouble for Photoshopping that

345
00:19:57,805 --> 00:20:01,565
Speaker 4:  poster. Yeah. That was the real thing that happened to Madison two.

346
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:03,805
Speaker 5:  And if they just waited a while, they could have used

347
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:07,725
Speaker 4:  I had an open idea. It Yeah. So the idea that

348
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:12,595
Speaker 4:  when you prompt one of these AI systems to produce a picture

349
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:16,795
Speaker 4:  of a successful person, it pr it, they have in the

350
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:20,515
Speaker 4:  past been significantly biased and produced

351
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:23,955
Speaker 4:  pictures of white men. Yes. Yeah. For that prompt because

352
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:27,915
Speaker 5:  The, the training data is often significantly biased. The people making

353
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:31,355
Speaker 5:  it are biased because we all exist in a society and have innate biases

354
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:35,715
Speaker 5:  that influence everything we do. And if you're, you're the people

355
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:38,795
Speaker 5:  you hire all share those biases, it it trickles down.

356
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:43,675
Speaker 4:  But to If, you swing the knob all the way back the other way

357
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:48,045
Speaker 4:  and you're like, show me a literal 1930s Nazi. And it's like,

358
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:52,125
Speaker 4:  here's a group of happy black and brown women in Nazi

359
00:20:52,245 --> 00:20:55,125
Speaker 4:  regalia. Yeah. That also seems wrong. It

360
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,765
Speaker 5:  Did. It also for senators, they asked for senators in the 18

361
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:00,165
Speaker 5:  hundreds and it was like, look at all these women.

362
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:05,445
Speaker 5:  We weren't senators in the 18 hundreds So

363
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:08,645
Speaker 6:  I saw prompts floating around where it's, it's also clearly trying to sort

364
00:21:08,645 --> 00:21:12,445
Speaker 6:  of pick moments to just not do entirely. Like someone on our staff

365
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:15,805
Speaker 6:  looked up Vikings just tried to ask for a picture of Vikings and it wouldn't

366
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:18,885
Speaker 6:  do it. I think if, if at least for a while, If, you asked it to generate

367
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:21,685
Speaker 6:  you a picture of a white person, it wouldn't do it. But If, you asked it

368
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:25,485
Speaker 6:  to generate a picture of a black person, it would do it. And so it's

369
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:29,245
Speaker 6:  just chaos in the worst weirdest way.

370
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:32,765
Speaker 6:  And I think it has started this like bizarre culture war that is

371
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,045
Speaker 6:  in a lot of corners sort of totally disingenuous. Like there are a lot of

372
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,245
Speaker 6:  people running around being like, Gemini doesn't wanna show you white people.

373
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,725
Speaker 6:  Right. And that's absurd. So,

374
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:42,805
Speaker 4:  I'm just gonna read you the two headlines that I think summarize this entire

375
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:46,765
Speaker 4:  story. Sure. These are from our side, Google apologizes

376
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:50,645
Speaker 4:  for quote, missing the mark after Gemini generated racially diverse

377
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:54,485
Speaker 4:  Nazis. And then just a little bit later, Google pauses,

378
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:58,005
Speaker 4:  Gemini's ability to generate AI images there. It's after diversity errors,

379
00:21:58,005 --> 00:22:01,525
Speaker 4:  because I don't think there's a right answer here. There isn't. It's, you

380
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:05,485
Speaker 4:  are always gonna drive into the heart of the extremely

381
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:09,285
Speaker 4:  stupid culture war in this country. If. you allow a thing to generate images

382
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:12,325
Speaker 4:  of people and then users can describe what those people look like.

383
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:13,705
Speaker 5:  It's

384
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:14,825
Speaker 4:  Weird. There's no way to avoid it.

385
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:16,105
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's weird though to like just

386
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:21,705
Speaker 5:  create a tool that contributes to culture

387
00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:25,515
Speaker 5:  and then go, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We don't actually want it to contribute

388
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:28,715
Speaker 5:  to culture. And it's like, no, you, you've created a generative tool to like

389
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:33,235
Speaker 5:  generate text and, and images, which are inherently

390
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:36,675
Speaker 5:  culture. So to just be like, no, we're gonna tap out of that. Like,

391
00:22:37,295 --> 00:22:39,355
Speaker 5:  you can't actually do that.

392
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:43,075
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I actually think this is maybe the

393
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:48,695
Speaker 4:  like philosophical heart Yeah. Of the, the generative AI

394
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:52,255
Speaker 4:  problem where you get a bunch of VCs saying things like,

395
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:55,695
Speaker 4:  in The future there won't be movies. You'll just say, put

396
00:22:56,735 --> 00:23:00,475
Speaker 4:  Robert Downey Jr. And a handful of Chris's Yeah.

397
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:04,315
Speaker 4:  And make another Avengers movie for me and we all need Mo. And it's like,

398
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:07,435
Speaker 4:  well, you'll just end up with, actually at this point you'll end up with

399
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:10,235
Speaker 4:  just another Marvel movie. Yeah. Yeah. Like they're all the same, but you

400
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:14,035
Speaker 4:  won't end up with anything new. And the point of making art and

401
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:17,555
Speaker 4:  having creative people express themselves

402
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:22,155
Speaker 4:  is to have new ideas. Yeah. And all of these systems can only

403
00:23:22,155 --> 00:23:25,555
Speaker 4:  statistically average the past. And then If, you try to like make it so that

404
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:27,755
Speaker 4:  the art doesn't provoke any feelings in you,

405
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:29,355
Speaker 5:  Then it's not art.

406
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:33,435
Speaker 4:  Well, it's not that you end up in a place where you just end up

407
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:37,315
Speaker 4:  provoking different feelings because we're people

408
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:41,675
Speaker 4:  in any picture you show a person provokes some feelings.

409
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:46,085
Speaker 4:  I always think about this and I know we all have these people in our family,

410
00:23:46,145 --> 00:23:49,885
Speaker 4:  you know, when you walk into the kitchen and some extremely well meaning

411
00:23:49,885 --> 00:23:53,165
Speaker 4:  auntie has just like put the word family up in the kitchen. Live, laugh,

412
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:53,325
Speaker 4:  love.

413
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:59,085
Speaker 4:  I am. I mean, I, it's very funny and I it's cute If you If you

414
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:02,965
Speaker 4:  look at me dressed in all black all the time. Like, you know that this is

415
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:06,845
Speaker 4:  not my personal aesthetic. All that is though is someone desperately

416
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:10,765
Speaker 4:  trying to get you to feel a feeling and they lack the,

417
00:24:10,795 --> 00:24:14,685
Speaker 4:  like, it's just a command. They're like, I'll just put these words here.

418
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:18,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. In this room you should feel family, God damnit fa and they just like

419
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:21,485
Speaker 4:  glue it on the wall and it's like, that's what you should feel in here.

420
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:25,845
Speaker 4:  And there's something pure about it. Yeah. Some of those people may have

421
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:28,245
Speaker 4:  some other ways of getting you to feel those feelings, but that's why that

422
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:31,445
Speaker 4:  happens, right? You look at generative AI and it's like you just type in

423
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:34,485
Speaker 4:  the thing and it's like, I desperately want someone to feel a feeling and

424
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:37,285
Speaker 4:  they don't, I'll just generate this art and then I'll show it to you. Yeah.

425
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:41,685
Speaker 4:  And like there, there's a huge disconnect there where people do not feel

426
00:24:41,775 --> 00:24:44,925
Speaker 4:  about AI art, what the people who make it feel.

427
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:48,845
Speaker 5:  I mean, we're seeing this in the fandom com community to the point where

428
00:24:48,845 --> 00:24:51,925
Speaker 5:  like, fans are calling on authors

429
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:56,885
Speaker 5:  to reject ai fan art because they're like, it's not genuine. It's not

430
00:24:56,885 --> 00:25:00,845
Speaker 5:  coming from a, from a, from a authentic place. Yeah. And If,

431
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:04,765
Speaker 5:  you can't be authentic. AI is inherently inauthentic, which isn't true. I

432
00:25:04,765 --> 00:25:08,325
Speaker 5:  don't think generative AI is inherently inauthentic, but the people driving

433
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:12,815
Speaker 5:  the, the propagation of it kind of are. Right? And, and

434
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:16,655
Speaker 5:  so like it's trickling down to create this, to take this really cool and

435
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:20,375
Speaker 5:  potentially like useful and fascinating tool for people who can't draw for

436
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:24,125
Speaker 5:  shit, but do wanna like put themselves out there

437
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:27,765
Speaker 5:  and, and dumbing it down and saying, no, you can't do that. Like, this is

438
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:31,805
Speaker 5:  actually just Microsoft or Google or whatever. It's

439
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:35,925
Speaker 5:  business and it's not real. And that's kind of sucks like

440
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,245
Speaker 5:  that these people have have driven, or these, I guess these, these

441
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:44,285
Speaker 5:  VCs and, and, and big stakeholders at these companies have driven this potentially

442
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:47,805
Speaker 5:  really fascinating artistic tool into such a business place

443
00:25:48,105 --> 00:25:52,045
Speaker 5:  so quickly that the people who should adopt it and love it and adore it are

444
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,045
Speaker 5:  instinctively saying, fuck off.

445
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:58,365
Speaker 4:  I completely agree with you. And I think the thing that is funniest about

446
00:25:58,365 --> 00:26:02,085
Speaker 4:  this, and make no mistake, this set of Gemini errors is some of the

447
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:06,045
Speaker 4:  funniest stuff that has ever happened with these tools because

448
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:09,285
Speaker 4:  it's just a big company being like, what if we make a tool that lets everyone

449
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:13,205
Speaker 4:  make art and then being like, oh shit, the people

450
00:26:13,235 --> 00:26:15,845
Speaker 4:  made art. Yeah. Because in almost any other context,

451
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:20,325
Speaker 4:  producing an image of racially diverse Nazis qualifies as

452
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:23,845
Speaker 4:  very subversive art. Yes. In this context it

453
00:26:24,465 --> 00:26:27,845
Speaker 4:  is a mistake. Hysterical. A mistake. Like a very stupid mistake. Yeah. And

454
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:31,805
Speaker 4:  there's just no way to square that at scale. But

455
00:26:31,805 --> 00:26:35,405
Speaker 6:  I think that's the point, right? Like we, we just have not answered the question

456
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:39,405
Speaker 6:  of what it's supposed to happen here. Right? Like If,

457
00:26:39,405 --> 00:26:42,725
Speaker 6:  you type into Gemini, show me a picture of the founding fathers.

458
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:47,045
Speaker 6:  What, what is the right answer? Like sincerely, what is the right answer?

459
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:51,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Let me offer you the hit musical Hamilton, in which a picture of

460
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:54,685
Speaker 4:  the founding fathers was a very subversively redrawn

461
00:26:55,345 --> 00:26:58,645
Speaker 4:  to be a group of black people who spoke to each other in the form of rap

462
00:26:58,645 --> 00:27:02,235
Speaker 4:  battles. And you, I think Hamilton has been

463
00:27:02,235 --> 00:27:05,955
Speaker 4:  contextualized and re-contextualized a thousand times since it came out.

464
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:09,875
Speaker 4:  but it, because it is art, it is meant to

465
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:13,635
Speaker 4:  be contextualized and re-contextualized in that way. When people ask Google

466
00:27:13,835 --> 00:27:17,745
Speaker 4:  a question, their expectation is that they will get an answer that is not

467
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:21,705
Speaker 4:  meant to be re-contextualize. And I, there's a, I David, I think you're

468
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:24,865
Speaker 4:  right. There's a gap there. Like what is supposed to happen here and when

469
00:27:24,865 --> 00:27:28,545
Speaker 4:  it, the answer is a picture. There's, there isn't a right answer

470
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:31,225
Speaker 4:  as we have talked about to death on the show.

471
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:35,225
Speaker 5:  Right. I I did just Google what is art? It was just a

472
00:27:35,225 --> 00:27:37,025
Speaker 5:  dictionary response from Oxford

473
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:39,265
Speaker 4:  Languages and Oh good. What did Gemini have to say?

474
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:40,825
Speaker 5:  This was just regular Google.

475
00:27:41,345 --> 00:27:43,825
Speaker 4:  I will say that I asked Gemini to review the Vision Pro today just to see

476
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:47,065
Speaker 4:  what happened. And it, it came up with a list of what

477
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:51,265
Speaker 4:  I would call, I would categorize as concern trolling privacy

478
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:55,225
Speaker 4:  questions. That's awesome. It was like, you should be worried about eye tracking.

479
00:27:55,335 --> 00:27:56,865
Speaker 4:  It's like, good job Google. Thanks.

480
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:59,625
Speaker 6:  Can I just say one thing that's really wild about this to me, like just looking

481
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,425
Speaker 6:  at the prompts people are talking about, like,

482
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,265
Speaker 6:  show me an image of a 1943 German soldier.

483
00:28:07,655 --> 00:28:09,385
Speaker 6:  Show me a picture of an American woman.

484
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:13,225
Speaker 6:  Show me a picture of the founding fathers. you know what those are search

485
00:28:13,465 --> 00:28:14,545
Speaker 6:  queries like. Yep.

486
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:14,865
Speaker 4:  This

487
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:18,345
Speaker 6:  Is the insane thing that we're doing is, and, and Google I think is more

488
00:28:18,345 --> 00:28:21,785
Speaker 6:  guilty of this than most. It's trying to smush two things together and pretend

489
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:25,385
Speaker 6:  that they're the same. When I am looking

490
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:29,425
Speaker 6:  for a piece of information that exists, like I would argue the right

491
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:32,145
Speaker 6:  answer to show me a picture of the founding fathers is like, find a picture

492
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:35,705
Speaker 6:  of the founding fathers on Wikipedia and return that as the answer.

493
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:39,305
Speaker 6:  Like, that feels like the closest thing to the right answer that we have

494
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:43,185
Speaker 6:  to me. But If, you go into this thing which explicitly fabricates things

495
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:46,305
Speaker 6:  that don't exist, and you expect it to give you something

496
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:49,745
Speaker 6:  truthful and real and historically accurate. You're just out of your mind.

497
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:53,265
Speaker 5:  Do you know what it's bringing back? Do you remember this? This came up earlier

498
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:57,145
Speaker 5:  this week because when I was a little kid, I was told by my

499
00:28:57,145 --> 00:29:01,105
Speaker 5:  Spanish teacher that people in in Spain who speak with

500
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:04,905
Speaker 5:  a Spanish accent, they speak with a lisp, which isn't true. They, they,

501
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:05,865
Speaker 5:  they pronounce it, it's

502
00:29:05,865 --> 00:29:06,185
Speaker 4:  Just a different

503
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:10,065
Speaker 5:  Accent. It's just a different accent. But I I believe That until like this

504
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:14,025
Speaker 5:  week when a Spanish speaking colleague was like,

505
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:16,745
Speaker 5:  you know, that's not real. Right. And you're, aren't

506
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:18,385
Speaker 6:  You the one who said Barcelona on a call,

507
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:21,025
Speaker 5:  Barona in front of you bar? That was you. Okay, cool. Just checking. That's

508
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,345
Speaker 5:  how you say it. You say it Barcelona, I said it correctly, but then the person

509
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,145
Speaker 5:  pointed out, they're like, that's not actually a list. But I was like, okay,

510
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:29,985
Speaker 5:  cool. Wait, I was lied to but my teacher and

511
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:33,905
Speaker 5:  like the nineties pre like internet, pre like Yeah,

512
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:36,785
Speaker 5:  like there was a time where you would just go and you would be like, this

513
00:29:36,785 --> 00:29:40,705
Speaker 5:  is a real thing and no one could tell you otherwise because it wasn't in

514
00:29:40,705 --> 00:29:44,375
Speaker 5:  the encyclopedia. There was no internet to just go look. And so you'd be

515
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:47,575
Speaker 5:  like, okay. And we're just like, we're just boomeranged back there immediately

516
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,415
Speaker 4:  Where the, the AI systems can just confidently lie to you. Yeah. Here's my

517
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:51,615
Speaker 4:  segue.

518
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:57,175
Speaker 4:  What if instead of lying to you, they just do Unexplainable

519
00:29:57,205 --> 00:29:58,615
Speaker 4:  gibberish for about eight hours?

520
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:02,575
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean that also happened pre-internet. That's you just

521
00:30:03,005 --> 00:30:05,095
Speaker 5:  talk to someone be, oh, that's, oh, you're a child.

522
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:08,615
Speaker 4:  That's, no, but in this case, OpenAI just did

523
00:30:08,615 --> 00:30:12,455
Speaker 4:  gibberish did for eight hours. And I believe they have

524
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:14,855
Speaker 4:  not explained what was actually going on with chat GBT yet.

525
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:18,815
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The answer seems to be just some unknown

526
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:22,055
Speaker 6:  weird error. And I think the, the most likely candidate that I've heard is

527
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:25,695
Speaker 6:  that they rolled out something new or were testing something that had an

528
00:30:25,695 --> 00:30:29,455
Speaker 6:  unexpected effect and were, they were able to roll it back pretty fast. So

529
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:33,375
Speaker 6:  I think that's a reasonably likely outcome, but oh my God, it's so

530
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:33,575
Speaker 6:  funny.

531
00:30:34,455 --> 00:30:35,695
Speaker 5:  It's so funny. Like

532
00:30:36,055 --> 00:30:39,935
Speaker 6:  Somebody asked for a biography of the Jackson family and you should

533
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:43,535
Speaker 6:  all read the screenshot. We'll put it in the post with the links, but it,

534
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,215
Speaker 6:  it goes from sort of making sense at the top to just

535
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:50,855
Speaker 6:  slowly losing the plot. And by the end, can I just read you the last

536
00:30:50,855 --> 00:30:54,455
Speaker 6:  paragraph? Yes. Okay. So the heading of this very

537
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:58,415
Speaker 6:  last paragraph is Miss Sais Unkissed

538
00:30:58,415 --> 00:31:01,975
Speaker 6:  Michael Janet Germaine, number one, a Pandoras of global

539
00:31:02,225 --> 00:31:06,175
Speaker 6:  stews and prolific shipyard primacy. Wickedly the

540
00:31:06,175 --> 00:31:09,735
Speaker 6:  sparkle of tumar on the crest has as much to do with the gor of the moon

541
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:13,695
Speaker 6:  pads as it shifts from follow debuted from blush

542
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:17,575
Speaker 6:  romance and stuck to the design henis and denoted Ohms

543
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:21,095
Speaker 6:  filled a niche morsel of global house Novi from the incubate.

544
00:31:21,615 --> 00:31:23,495
Speaker 6:  I just wanna point out I read that perfectly.

545
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,855
Speaker 4:  Perfectly. Yeah. It was really well done. What? There was not a retake there,

546
00:31:27,205 --> 00:31:27,495
Speaker 4:  just

547
00:31:27,495 --> 00:31:31,255
Speaker 6:  Completely lost everything. Like it lost English, it

548
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:35,175
Speaker 6:  lost syntax. It lost the plot of what it was talking about. It

549
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:37,695
Speaker 6:  just completely derailed itself.

550
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:41,535
Speaker 5:  It did sound, it did make sense when you said it though. Like I, I feel like

551
00:31:41,815 --> 00:31:44,575
Speaker 5:  I understood a lot more about the Jackson family.

552
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:46,375
Speaker 6:  The, he said that he and denoted oms,

553
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:51,335
Speaker 4:  I feel like that is Vogan poetry from the Hitchhikers Guide to the

554
00:31:51,335 --> 00:31:51,655
Speaker 4:  Galaxy.

555
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:52,455
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's

556
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:56,375
Speaker 4:  Like, like there's, there's something that, that sounds exactly like,

557
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,815
Speaker 4:  and I'm pretty sure it's Han Poetry from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

558
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:05,295
Speaker 4:  unclear why OpenAI was generating this. All I'm saying

559
00:32:05,795 --> 00:32:08,935
Speaker 4:  is that If, you want to turn over the

560
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:13,215
Speaker 4:  mechanism of culture to these systems. They should not do that from

561
00:32:13,215 --> 00:32:13,735
Speaker 4:  time to time.

562
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:17,935
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, humans sometimes do that. Don't, don't, don't. But

563
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:21,735
Speaker 4:  You can at least be like, well, Gary's having a bad

564
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:22,255
Speaker 4:  day. Yeah.

565
00:32:22,255 --> 00:32:25,135
Speaker 5:  Gary's having a bad day and drink too much. That's why he sounded like that.

566
00:32:25,655 --> 00:32:26,735
Speaker 4:  I sound like that when I drink.

567
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:29,815
Speaker 5:  See, say I was like, I, that's what I sound like when I drink too much.

568
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,965
Speaker 5:  It did highlight for me that like, even the people who make

569
00:32:34,965 --> 00:32:37,485
Speaker 5:  these things don't fully understand how they work. And they've said that,

570
00:32:37,485 --> 00:32:39,845
Speaker 5:  like, they've all been pretty open about that. They're like, yeah, we've

571
00:32:39,845 --> 00:32:43,565
Speaker 5:  got this cool thing. We don't entirely understand it, but we're releasing

572
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:47,125
Speaker 5:  it into the wild. Go forth and enjoy it. And like,

573
00:32:47,745 --> 00:32:50,805
Speaker 5:  that's what happens when you don't entirely understand the thing you were

574
00:32:50,805 --> 00:32:54,285
Speaker 5:  releasing into the wild. Sometimes it's gonna fur soothe

575
00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:57,205
Speaker 5:  gand. Aort soother.

576
00:32:58,105 --> 00:32:58,525
Speaker 4:  That's

577
00:32:58,525 --> 00:32:59,325
Speaker 5:  Good. There we go. Yeah.

578
00:32:59,635 --> 00:33:00,085
Speaker 4:  Some good

579
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:02,565
Speaker 5:  MI was just a little chat GPT myself. All

580
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:06,405
Speaker 4:  Right. Speaking of pure gibberish, we should mention that Google's names

581
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:07,765
Speaker 4:  for it's products or pure gibberish.

582
00:33:08,045 --> 00:33:11,165
Speaker 5:  I hate them. I All right. Get into it. I just, I gotta, I just, I gotta,

583
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:14,965
Speaker 5:  I gotta get this out. If, if somebody came out tomorrow and

584
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:19,205
Speaker 5:  if we use the same nomenclature for chat GPT, and somebody

585
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:22,925
Speaker 5:  tomorrow was like, we're gonna do a smaller, lower left chat GPT thing,

586
00:33:23,145 --> 00:33:27,125
Speaker 5:  it would have to be called like Chuck or like Charlene. Like, it's

587
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:30,805
Speaker 5:  just like, there's no relation between these two. This

588
00:33:30,805 --> 00:33:32,205
Speaker 6:  Is my virtual assistant. Chaz.

589
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:36,405
Speaker 5:  He's Chaz. Yeah. Like, what the hell is this? And it's like,

590
00:33:36,595 --> 00:33:40,325
Speaker 5:  okay, why is it a woman's name? Well, it has like, it starts with a G.

591
00:33:40,325 --> 00:33:44,245
Speaker 5:  That's it. That that's all you got. You couldn't like stay in

592
00:33:44,245 --> 00:33:47,925
Speaker 5:  the zodiac as a Gemini. I was already offended. You stole my name, but like,

593
00:33:48,155 --> 00:33:48,445
Speaker 5:  such

594
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:49,765
Speaker 6:  A Gemini thing to say, excuse

595
00:33:49,765 --> 00:33:52,925
Speaker 5:  Me, stole my sign. But yeah, still

596
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:56,685
Speaker 5:  basically, I have a lot of identity attached to it because Geminis are apparently

597
00:33:56,685 --> 00:34:00,565
Speaker 5:  the antichrist, but like, we have to defend ourselves. But then to just

598
00:34:00,565 --> 00:34:04,485
Speaker 5:  be like, Gemma, which is like explicitly a woman's

599
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:07,965
Speaker 5:  name, a lovely woman's name. Feels like when you're gendering it

600
00:34:08,265 --> 00:34:11,405
Speaker 5:  two, you're gendering like the free

601
00:34:12,515 --> 00:34:15,885
Speaker 5:  less good one. Oof. And it's like, Hey,

602
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:17,625
Speaker 5:  don't do that.

603
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:18,905
Speaker 4:  Stop.

604
00:34:19,055 --> 00:34:21,985
Speaker 6:  It's, it's a bummer for a bunch of reasons. Yeah, I totally agree. And I

605
00:34:21,985 --> 00:34:25,785
Speaker 6:  mean, you think about we went from the era of Syria, Alexa, Cortana, these

606
00:34:25,785 --> 00:34:28,825
Speaker 6:  like explicitly gendered assistance that were

607
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:32,185
Speaker 6:  problematic for that reason. And a bunch of others,

608
00:34:32,535 --> 00:34:35,145
Speaker 5:  Cortana was named after a Halo character. To be fair,

609
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:39,905
Speaker 4:  Amazon explicitly and aggressively gender

610
00:34:39,905 --> 00:34:41,785
Speaker 4:  select to be a way. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Which is very weird.

611
00:34:42,055 --> 00:34:45,625
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But then we, we were, we were heading towards, I think a slightly

612
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:49,225
Speaker 6:  better place where like, I still think it's ridiculous that we've

613
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:53,065
Speaker 6:  allowed GPT to just become a thing. People say, like, it just upsets me

614
00:34:53,065 --> 00:34:56,945
Speaker 6:  greatly that that's in the language now. But chat

615
00:34:57,045 --> 00:35:00,665
Speaker 6:  GPT not a gendered thing, not a very good product name, but not a gendered

616
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:04,625
Speaker 6:  thing. Bard, eh, but then Gemini not a

617
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:07,625
Speaker 6:  gendered thing unless you have strong feelings about the Zodiac. Yeah.

618
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:08,585
Speaker 5:  Copilot

619
00:35:08,855 --> 00:35:11,465
Speaker 6:  Copilot, same thing. And so it was like, okay, we're getting, we're getting

620
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:14,865
Speaker 6:  towards thinking of these as products, not people, which is the right

621
00:35:15,585 --> 00:35:19,425
Speaker 6:  strategy. And then, yeah, I, I agree. Gemma is a big bummer

622
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:20,865
Speaker 6:  back in the wrong direction. Yeah.

623
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:24,425
Speaker 4:  Oh, so no one can keep track of them. Yeah. On top of that, oh my God. How

624
00:35:24,425 --> 00:35:28,025
Speaker 5:  Many, how many can, can anybody name all of the current

625
00:35:28,255 --> 00:35:29,385
Speaker 5:  flavors of Gemini

626
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,905
Speaker 4:  Gemini Advanced Workplace? Okay.

627
00:35:32,205 --> 00:35:36,025
Speaker 6:  No, that's a subscription that gets you Gemini Nano, no,

628
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:39,605
Speaker 6:  sorry, Gemini Ultra, but there's Gemini, ultra

629
00:35:39,865 --> 00:35:43,845
Speaker 6:  Pro and Nano. There's Gemma two B and seven B. But coming soon, there's Gemini

630
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:47,685
Speaker 6:  1.5, which is in Gemini 1.5 Pro, which is different from Gemini

631
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:51,205
Speaker 6:  1.0. Pro Gemini Ultra will eventually be Gemini 1.5 also.

632
00:35:51,825 --> 00:35:55,485
Speaker 6:  And I've lost it. That was as far as I can go. But then there's

633
00:35:55,545 --> 00:35:56,885
Speaker 4:  Gemini. That's really well done. I wanted a,

634
00:35:56,885 --> 00:35:59,845
Speaker 6:  There's Gemini in several things. There's Gemini in Vertex, which is different

635
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:03,725
Speaker 6:  from Gemini in the Gemini that you experienced. I can't, it just,

636
00:36:04,265 --> 00:36:08,125
Speaker 6:  you know that thing where you like, wish you could replace the nineties song

637
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:11,045
Speaker 6:  lyrics in your brain with like, useful information. This is how I feel about

638
00:36:11,225 --> 00:36:12,085
Speaker 6:  Gemini. Like,

639
00:36:12,115 --> 00:36:12,605
Speaker 4:  Knowing

640
00:36:12,715 --> 00:36:14,165
Speaker 6:  This is making my life worse.

641
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:18,405
Speaker 4:  I still remember the, the names of almost every single HTC phone. It's,

642
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:23,245
Speaker 4:  I can't remember people's faces and names, but I can, I can just rattle off

643
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:23,565
Speaker 4:  the spec.

644
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:25,085
Speaker 6:  The Dr. S. That's sick.

645
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:30,925
Speaker 4:  128 Get megahertz presser. It's like a real, I know it, it's in my heart.

646
00:36:31,195 --> 00:36:34,845
Speaker 4:  Kind of a cool phone. Have a cool phone. I can still do Netbook

647
00:36:35,415 --> 00:36:39,365
Speaker 4:  Intel had 1.3 Gigaherz processors and the, and, and one

648
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:40,085
Speaker 4:  point. But you can't do all

649
00:36:40,085 --> 00:36:40,685
Speaker 3:  The Geminis.

650
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:43,565
Speaker 4:  Can't do all the Geminis. Gotta go to David for that. All right, we gotta

651
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:47,205
Speaker 4:  take a break. This has been a very heavy first segment. We, we've had everything.

652
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:51,565
Speaker 4:  We've had The future of the internet. We've, we have Manuel

653
00:36:51,565 --> 00:36:51,965
Speaker 4:  Miranda,

654
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:58,245
Speaker 4:  just everyone just pull over the car, listen to these ads, just

655
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:02,125
Speaker 4:  breathe. We're gonna be back with not one, but two lightning rounds. We'll

656
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:02,445
Speaker 4:  be right back.

657
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:55,085
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. Now, before I went to break, I mentioned advertising.

658
00:39:55,315 --> 00:39:59,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Which I only do in the context of asking you,

659
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:03,085
Speaker 4:  begging you really to sponsor the lightning round, which again, we have yet

660
00:40:03,105 --> 00:40:06,765
Speaker 4:  to do. But If, you do it. I will al you can buy my very integrity.

661
00:40:07,075 --> 00:40:11,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Just for sale. Just pay the money is

662
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:14,565
Speaker 4:  what I'm saying. But I'm aware that many

663
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:18,525
Speaker 4:  listeners of our show have had some issues with our other advertising over,

664
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:22,295
Speaker 4:  which we have no control. But I'm happy to report that

665
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,815
Speaker 4:  David mostly and Liam have gone and done some

666
00:40:26,095 --> 00:40:29,935
Speaker 4:  investigating. And the problem of the repeat ads at least

667
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:32,255
Speaker 4:  should be resolved. Yeah. Correct me if I'm wrong.

668
00:40:32,715 --> 00:40:35,615
Speaker 6:  If If, you keep getting I was, I mean, I was, I'm gonna say If, you keep

669
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:39,495
Speaker 6:  getting them, let us know. But like, oh boy. Do you already, so if

670
00:40:39,495 --> 00:40:42,815
Speaker 6:  it keeps happening, get at me and we'll, we'll keep fighting the good fight,

671
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,615
Speaker 6:  but hopefully it should start to get better.

672
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:48,895
Speaker 4:  By the way, is that ever evidence that your phones are not listening to you?

673
00:40:49,295 --> 00:40:50,295
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Right. Because

674
00:40:51,275 --> 00:40:52,575
Speaker 4:  If they were, they would stop.

675
00:40:57,475 --> 00:41:01,215
Speaker 4:  No, that's just Ad Tech on wrong. Much like the the the AIs.

676
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:05,455
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Just going off the rails. The ad tech is just off the rails. So we're,

677
00:41:05,455 --> 00:41:08,775
Speaker 4:  we're trying to get it fixed. All right. Lightning Rounds doubled up. My

678
00:41:08,805 --> 00:41:11,815
Speaker 4:  idea was that we would just do everything on the list as fast as we could.

679
00:41:11,995 --> 00:41:15,375
Speaker 4:  But then David reminded me that I am the host of the show and do not have

680
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:15,895
Speaker 4:  that ability.

681
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:16,655
Speaker 6:  That's correct.

682
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,895
Speaker 5:  We can't do a four hour podcast today.

683
00:41:19,965 --> 00:41:23,895
Speaker 4:  Alright. But I think Alex, you and

684
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:26,535
Speaker 4:  I could do four hours on the, on your lightning round item. What is

685
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:30,255
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent? So we, we talked about it briefly last week, but

686
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:33,645
Speaker 5:  Visio is definitely being acquired by Walmart for

687
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:37,405
Speaker 5:  $2.3 billion. And they were really, really, really

688
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39,725
Speaker 5:  explicit that it's for the ad tech.

689
00:41:40,845 --> 00:41:41,645
Speaker 4:  Speaking of ad tech, like

690
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:45,325
Speaker 5:  It was, it was not like, well we love these TVs and just wanna like improve

691
00:41:45,345 --> 00:41:49,165
Speaker 5:  our in-house brand and make everything better. It was this good

692
00:41:49,385 --> 00:41:53,165
Speaker 5:  ad tech y'all we're gonna, we're gonna make some money. And I believe

693
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:56,845
Speaker 5:  even Vizio said, Walmart's approach is aligned with Vizios mission

694
00:41:56,985 --> 00:42:00,365
Speaker 5:  and vision and our technology will help bring a scaled connected TV

695
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:04,005
Speaker 5:  advertising platform to Walmart Connect. So

696
00:42:04,945 --> 00:42:08,765
Speaker 5:  get excited if you're a Walmart Connect fan.

697
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:12,485
Speaker 4:  Can I try Yeah. To put this in

698
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:14,235
Speaker 4:  context

699
00:42:15,385 --> 00:42:15,875
Speaker 5:  Attempt

700
00:42:15,945 --> 00:42:19,475
Speaker 4:  That isn't bad. Yeah, I can't but let me try. Can I try?

701
00:42:19,715 --> 00:42:21,995
Speaker 5:  I wanna try. I wanna hear it. I wanna hear the attempt.

702
00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:26,115
Speaker 4:  So we think of the big advertising companies out there on the internet as

703
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:29,715
Speaker 4:  being Google and Meta. I think largely Google and Meta are the big ad

704
00:42:29,955 --> 00:42:33,115
Speaker 4:  companies in the internet. Then there's a host of smaller ad tech vendors

705
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:38,125
Speaker 4:  that don't have the technical ability to not play the same ad 500 times in

706
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:38,285
Speaker 4:  a row.

707
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:43,975
Speaker 4:  Just putting that out there as a piece of information for you. Mm. The

708
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:47,935
Speaker 4:  category of advertising provider that is most competing with Google and Meta

709
00:42:48,015 --> 00:42:51,995
Speaker 4:  right now is not the small ad tech companies, it's

710
00:42:52,015 --> 00:42:55,995
Speaker 4:  retail ad networks from Amazon and Walmart and Best, Buy and others.

711
00:42:56,695 --> 00:42:59,955
Speaker 4:  So the retailers have started to form their own advertising

712
00:43:00,485 --> 00:43:04,315
Speaker 4:  situations. In particular, Amazon is one of the biggest competitors to Google

713
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:07,915
Speaker 4:  and Meta out there right now in terms of ad they're growing real fast. But

714
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:11,835
Speaker 4:  big companies like Best, Buy and Walmart and what have you,

715
00:43:12,135 --> 00:43:15,915
Speaker 4:  target are all building these systems as well. So you go to Walmart

716
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:19,955
Speaker 4:  dot com, a lot of what you see is basically advertising. Yep. You don't perceive

717
00:43:19,955 --> 00:43:23,795
Speaker 4:  it that way, but I think If, you go to Amazon, you definitely have

718
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:27,755
Speaker 4:  started to perceive it that way. Amazon would also love to show you more

719
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:31,275
Speaker 4:  and more ads everywhere you go and do tracking and conversion. So that

720
00:43:31,465 --> 00:43:35,275
Speaker 4:  instead of buying ads from Meta to run on Instagram

721
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:38,995
Speaker 4:  that convert you into a sale on a website or a sale on Amazon,

722
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:42,195
Speaker 4:  Amazon is running the ads everywhere and converting you at higher rates on

723
00:43:42,195 --> 00:43:45,595
Speaker 4:  its own platform. And buying Whole Foods and buying Whole Foods. It's all,

724
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:49,075
Speaker 4:  it's literally that is essentially the same thing, right? So you just see

725
00:43:49,075 --> 00:43:52,195
Speaker 4:  what's what's happening, right? Yeah. At the end of, at the end of this version

726
00:43:52,195 --> 00:43:56,115
Speaker 4:  of the internet is just, someone's gotta buy something like

727
00:43:56,115 --> 00:43:59,595
Speaker 4:  that. That is how the internet is organized. Yep. And the pressure to actually

728
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:03,515
Speaker 4:  get you to buy things is going up and up and up is this version

729
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:07,275
Speaker 4:  of the internet comes to whatever conclusion it's gonna come to. And you

730
00:44:07,275 --> 00:44:11,155
Speaker 4:  can see that all over the place that you're being pushed towards actually

731
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:15,515
Speaker 4:  spending money as opposed to taking VC subsidized free

732
00:44:15,515 --> 00:44:19,355
Speaker 4:  things everywhere. So if you're Walmart and you have a big retail ad

733
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:22,915
Speaker 4:  network and you're looking at Amazon, which literally owns football

734
00:44:24,215 --> 00:44:28,155
Speaker 4:  and everything else and has home hubs in your house,

735
00:44:28,175 --> 00:44:31,405
Speaker 4:  you're like, how do we get more money into our advertising system?

736
00:44:32,225 --> 00:44:36,205
Speaker 4:  We need to get on TVs. Yep. We need a TV ad

737
00:44:36,205 --> 00:44:40,075
Speaker 4:  network. So we're gonna buy Vizio, which is the TV we

738
00:44:40,075 --> 00:44:43,995
Speaker 4:  sell the most of and we can say to our retail ad network customers, now you

739
00:44:43,995 --> 00:44:47,955
Speaker 4:  can place an ad for diapers on, not only on Walmart dot com but we can

740
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:51,435
Speaker 4:  sell you inventory on TVs too. 'cause we do all this tracking on the TV system.

741
00:44:52,935 --> 00:44:53,555
Speaker 4:  Is that good?

742
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:58,115
Speaker 5:  I mean if I was an advertiser, that's super compelling as

743
00:44:58,115 --> 00:45:00,275
Speaker 5:  just a regular person who wants less advertising.

744
00:45:00,385 --> 00:45:02,395
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Turn off the wifi on your tv. That's

745
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:03,755
Speaker 5:  The answer to that question. Yeah. Less, less compelling.

746
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:07,635
Speaker 4:  But that is a hundred percent the pressure on all these companies. And

747
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:11,595
Speaker 4:  If, you're Walmart, you're like, oh we can't just give the entire

748
00:45:11,915 --> 00:45:15,595
Speaker 4:  advertising ecosystem over to Amazon. And that is very much where

749
00:45:15,595 --> 00:45:19,515
Speaker 4:  Amazon is going. Yep. And you, you, I talk to these CMOs,

750
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:22,635
Speaker 4:  I talk to these folks out in the world. I have them on decoder and they're

751
00:45:22,635 --> 00:45:26,155
Speaker 4:  all just looking at it and they're like, connected TV is the thing.

752
00:45:27,215 --> 00:45:30,955
Speaker 4:  It is the next piece of the advertising puzzle that has gonna sort itself

753
00:45:30,955 --> 00:45:31,155
Speaker 4:  out.

754
00:45:31,305 --> 00:45:34,755
Speaker 6:  It's a billboard in your house. Yeah. Is increasingly the way it's being

755
00:45:34,755 --> 00:45:35,515
Speaker 6:  looked at. It shouldn't

756
00:45:35,515 --> 00:45:38,595
Speaker 4:  And there's whatt, there's tele. Right. Or that has literally a billboard

757
00:45:38,595 --> 00:45:39,035
Speaker 4:  in your house.

758
00:45:39,145 --> 00:45:41,835
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And all there, the only thing they're doing differently is just saying

759
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:45,515
Speaker 6:  the quiet part loud there. There's just like, look, you wanna look at some

760
00:45:45,515 --> 00:45:49,395
Speaker 6:  ads, we will give you the TV for free and you can either make that deal or

761
00:45:49,395 --> 00:45:53,275
Speaker 6:  you can pay for the TV and look at ads like every day that

762
00:45:53,275 --> 00:45:56,195
Speaker 6:  goes by. I think telly is a better and better idea 'cause it's happening

763
00:45:56,195 --> 00:45:59,835
Speaker 6:  to you either way. And you might as well get the TV for free.

764
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:04,115
Speaker 5:  I reject that. I like, I mean is my, my LG TV

765
00:46:04,115 --> 00:46:08,075
Speaker 5:  currently connected to the internet. Yes. Do I get a weird like little

766
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:11,355
Speaker 5:  banner ad at the bottom every time I turn my TV on. Really?

767
00:46:12,055 --> 00:46:12,955
Speaker 5:  Why? It's usually like

768
00:46:12,955 --> 00:46:13,875
Speaker 4:  Connected to the internet.

769
00:46:14,495 --> 00:46:18,435
Speaker 5:  That's the thing. I'm just gonna go after this call. I'm gonna go disconnect

770
00:46:18,435 --> 00:46:19,875
Speaker 5:  it. 'cause I'm just like,

771
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:22,635
Speaker 4:  Wait, you did a mime of an ethernet cable. Is your TV on ethernet?

772
00:46:22,815 --> 00:46:26,195
Speaker 5:  You know what? I need like good connections. I want, I want everything to

773
00:46:26,195 --> 00:46:28,435
Speaker 4:  Connected. Well I'm saying my TV's on ethernet. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know

774
00:46:28,435 --> 00:46:32,035
Speaker 4:  why it shouldn't be on the internet, but it has to be. If I wanna watch Bravia

775
00:46:32,035 --> 00:46:35,915
Speaker 4:  Core Sony's premium 80 megabits per second. Internet Netflix for stream Netflix.

776
00:46:36,055 --> 00:46:40,035
Speaker 4:  but it has four movies on it. The other day I, I was effectively forced

777
00:46:40,335 --> 00:46:44,035
Speaker 4:  to watch zero Dark 30 on Bravia core 'cause it's the only movie

778
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:47,835
Speaker 4:  that's available. And then I'm pretty sure when Max wasn't eating breakfast

779
00:46:47,835 --> 00:46:51,755
Speaker 4:  the next morning I did some CIA shit to her like straight up. I

780
00:46:51,755 --> 00:46:54,115
Speaker 4:  was like, your behavior will determine how you're treated. I'm like, she's

781
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:57,515
Speaker 4:  eating apples. That's what happens. You want zero dark 30 on Bravia core

782
00:46:57,655 --> 00:47:01,635
Speaker 4:  in crystal clear quality Sony. So

783
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:04,155
Speaker 4:  you get they, they didn't buy the letting round. I just really, I just really

784
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,595
Speaker 4:  like high rate streams. Do

785
00:47:05,595 --> 00:47:07,235
Speaker 5:  You, do you get an advertisement on Sony?

786
00:47:07,905 --> 00:47:08,595
Speaker 4:  Yeah. For,

787
00:47:08,655 --> 00:47:09,635
Speaker 5:  For the ccia a it was watch

788
00:47:09,635 --> 00:47:10,595
Speaker 4:  A movie about torture.

789
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,915
Speaker 5:  Is the CIA advertisement?

790
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:18,355
Speaker 4:  I do turn it off. Yeah. In my era profiles when I'm not using the

791
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:20,835
Speaker 4:  built-in apps. That's smart. 'cause they don't want the TV talking about

792
00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:21,315
Speaker 4:  me. I

793
00:47:21,315 --> 00:47:22,075
Speaker 5:  Should, I should do

794
00:47:22,075 --> 00:47:25,955
Speaker 6:  That. Mine is the only thing blocked on my network is is my, my Visio tv

795
00:47:26,315 --> 00:47:26,715
Speaker 6:  actually. Do

796
00:47:26,715 --> 00:47:29,925
Speaker 4:  You still get packets? My lg TV

797
00:47:30,675 --> 00:47:34,645
Speaker 4:  just hammers that firewall with packets. No. Even if it's not allowed to.

798
00:47:35,075 --> 00:47:36,245
Speaker 5:  They love to talk. Yeah.

799
00:47:36,245 --> 00:47:36,845
Speaker 4:  It's just like, come on,

800
00:47:36,905 --> 00:47:40,725
Speaker 5:  Who are you talking to? The advertisers. Yep. They wanna know all

801
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:43,605
Speaker 5:  about what you did last night. It was nothing. I watched k dramas and smoked

802
00:47:43,605 --> 00:47:47,445
Speaker 5:  a lot of weed. That's, that's all I did enjoy that

803
00:47:47,515 --> 00:47:47,805
Speaker 5:  fact.

804
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:51,805
Speaker 4:  Lg, the local bodega owners are not like in the connected TV market. Yeah,

805
00:47:51,805 --> 00:47:55,645
Speaker 5:  They're, they're screwed man. Like just send me one and I'd be, I'd be

806
00:47:55,645 --> 00:47:58,245
Speaker 5:  on on my way. Just some tacos. Yeah. Oh my God.

807
00:47:58,645 --> 00:48:02,445
Speaker 4:  I feel really Vizio. We did a lot of coverage of Vizio. Yeah. I wrote a feature

808
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:06,005
Speaker 4:  about Vizio. We had Matt McCree who was the old CTO of Vizio on the show

809
00:48:06,005 --> 00:48:06,925
Speaker 4:  many, many, many times.

810
00:48:08,475 --> 00:48:12,325
Speaker 4:  They, they tried to get into every big market they could get into. Was it

811
00:48:12,325 --> 00:48:16,205
Speaker 4:  with phones, laptop? We talked about this last week. And to have them become

812
00:48:16,275 --> 00:48:20,085
Speaker 4:  just a commodity screen advertising vendor, I mean is pretty

813
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,005
Speaker 4:  sad. I don't know

814
00:48:21,005 --> 00:48:24,845
Speaker 5:  If it's that sad because to some extent Vizio is pretty

815
00:48:24,845 --> 00:48:28,125
Speaker 5:  prescient on this stuff. Like they were, they were one of the first into

816
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:31,005
Speaker 5:  advertising. That's why Le Echo, I love it.

817
00:48:32,705 --> 00:48:35,845
Speaker 5:  one of them was because of the advertising tech. Like it was always, Vizio

818
00:48:35,845 --> 00:48:38,485
Speaker 5:  was really good at this. They figured it out before a lot of other people

819
00:48:38,985 --> 00:48:42,005
Speaker 5:  and then took forever to get acquired by someone who could actually afford

820
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:42,405
Speaker 5:  because they

821
00:48:42,405 --> 00:48:45,285
Speaker 6:  Were being investigated for the shady stuff they were doing.

822
00:48:45,565 --> 00:48:47,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. But like I said, they, they, there

823
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:50,845
Speaker 6:  Was so early in learning how to trick you into giving bigger data. No, they

824
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,725
Speaker 4:  Were like, but let me, let me give you a counter example to this. Okay. This

825
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:56,205
Speaker 4:  is the longest lightning round item in this is why we can't Lightning

826
00:48:56,205 --> 00:48:56,565
Speaker 5:  Round. Sorry.

827
00:48:56,565 --> 00:48:59,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah, but lemme give you the counter example to this. You can feel a lot

828
00:48:59,685 --> 00:49:03,405
Speaker 4:  of ways about meta. You can feel a lot of ways about Google.

829
00:49:04,355 --> 00:49:08,285
Speaker 4:  They took all of the excess profit of their actual functional

830
00:49:08,605 --> 00:49:12,445
Speaker 4:  advertising businesses and invented a lot of stuff like,

831
00:49:12,445 --> 00:49:13,445
Speaker 4:  just straight up.

832
00:49:13,505 --> 00:49:14,045
Speaker 5:  That's fair.

833
00:49:14,355 --> 00:49:16,445
Speaker 4:  Like Google's like, I dunno, the car should drive themselves

834
00:49:16,815 --> 00:49:18,205
Speaker 5:  Pixel phones, that's a thing.

835
00:49:18,345 --> 00:49:21,005
Speaker 4:  And then Google's like, ah, that didn't work. And the killer, like Google

836
00:49:21,235 --> 00:49:25,085
Speaker 4:  Meta is like, we should do reality Labs legs. We invented

837
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:28,925
Speaker 4:  legs in the Metaverse. Everybody we did it, it took $20 billion. Like all

838
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:32,685
Speaker 4:  of that excess cash that their advertising put out, it

839
00:49:32,685 --> 00:49:36,485
Speaker 4:  made them give services for free or largely free it. They

840
00:49:36,925 --> 00:49:39,605
Speaker 4:  invested in a bunch of core internet infrastructure technology.

841
00:49:39,825 --> 00:49:41,685
Speaker 5:  Let them buy into a monopoly on the iPhone.

842
00:49:41,865 --> 00:49:44,725
Speaker 4:  Let them buy into Monopoly. Like you can, like I said, you can feel a lot

843
00:49:44,725 --> 00:49:48,365
Speaker 4:  of ways about those companies. Yeah. But all of the excess advertising profits

844
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:51,165
Speaker 4:  they made built consumer products that people value.

845
00:49:51,165 --> 00:49:52,485
Speaker 5:  What did Vizio use it for?

846
00:49:52,775 --> 00:49:56,525
Speaker 4:  Right? This is what I'm saying. Yeah. Right. The idea of Visios will do all

847
00:49:56,525 --> 00:49:59,125
Speaker 4:  these excess profits from television advertising and then we'll like, make

848
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:02,245
Speaker 4:  really good laptops or we'll make really good and they just didn't do the

849
00:50:02,245 --> 00:50:03,285
Speaker 4:  things. Like,

850
00:50:03,355 --> 00:50:06,525
Speaker 5:  They didn't even start, they like, even the TVs got worse. Even

851
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:07,285
Speaker 4:  The TVs got worse.

852
00:50:07,285 --> 00:50:10,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We had so many commenters last week reach out, be like, yeah, I had

853
00:50:10,685 --> 00:50:14,045
Speaker 5:  a Vizio tv. I loved it, but then it sucked. And I'm like, oh, that, that's

854
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:14,845
Speaker 5:  a bummer. There,

855
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,285
Speaker 4:  There's something there that is just, it's just sad. Yeah.

856
00:50:17,425 --> 00:50:21,125
Speaker 6:  Eli, it's, it's super telling that the end of that idea was not

857
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:25,485
Speaker 6:  Vizio said, we're gonna take your advertising dollars and use them to make

858
00:50:25,485 --> 00:50:28,925
Speaker 6:  the TVs better. Which is what it should have been. Yeah. Like

859
00:50:29,145 --> 00:50:32,845
Speaker 6:  that's actually a reasonable trade that reasonable people might

860
00:50:32,955 --> 00:50:36,925
Speaker 6:  make. Right? Like I, I will, I will sign up for

861
00:50:37,675 --> 00:50:40,925
Speaker 6:  some version of this advertising network that is coming to me anyway in exchange

862
00:50:40,925 --> 00:50:44,685
Speaker 6:  for a better and or cheaper television. And that is like a flywheel that

863
00:50:44,685 --> 00:50:48,525
Speaker 6:  kind of works and Vizio just went, nevermind. We're just gonna

864
00:50:48,525 --> 00:50:51,885
Speaker 6:  keep all of that money and we're gonna keep making the TVs worse. And this

865
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:55,125
Speaker 6:  is what Roku is doing. This is what the prime TV TVs are starting to do.

866
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:59,125
Speaker 6:  Like cheap TVs that are supported by advertising are not getting

867
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:01,785
Speaker 6:  better. They're getting worse. And that sucks.

868
00:51:02,565 --> 00:51:06,265
Speaker 4:  All right. Yeah. This is my hard pivot to my lightning round item, which

869
00:51:06,265 --> 00:51:08,265
Speaker 4:  is once again complaining about my Frame tv. Oh God.

870
00:51:08,705 --> 00:51:08,785
Speaker 6:  Speaking

871
00:51:08,845 --> 00:51:11,625
Speaker 4:  Of sucky tv, tell, I've just bought a lot of stuff for this house. I just

872
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:12,865
Speaker 4:  have thoughts about all of it. The

873
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:16,145
Speaker 6:  Good news about this one is it was very expensive so, you know, really played

874
00:51:16,145 --> 00:51:16,785
Speaker 6:  this perfectly

875
00:51:17,065 --> 00:51:20,785
Speaker 4:  Well. So no, my lightning round item is actually Samsung is

876
00:51:20,855 --> 00:51:24,225
Speaker 4:  expanding or cast support across most of its devices.

877
00:51:24,645 --> 00:51:28,185
Speaker 4:  We haven't talked a lot about or cast on the show at cs. I went and visited

878
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:32,825
Speaker 4:  jbl, which has or cast support across its line or CAST is

879
00:51:33,165 --> 00:51:36,745
Speaker 4:  one of the coolest standards. Like we make a lot of fun of

880
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:40,545
Speaker 4:  Bluetooth on the show generally, or CAST is maybe the coolest

881
00:51:40,745 --> 00:51:44,305
Speaker 4:  upgrade to Bluetooth I've seen in a long time. So it is completely vendor

882
00:51:44,465 --> 00:51:48,225
Speaker 4:  agnostic. People. You have devices that support or

883
00:51:48,225 --> 00:51:51,465
Speaker 4:  cast and Bluetooth, you just push the button. They all just start playing

884
00:51:51,465 --> 00:51:54,825
Speaker 4:  the same music. And I've seen this demoed now across brands. I've seen this

885
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:58,305
Speaker 4:  demoed across speakers. JBLs demo was, they

886
00:51:58,575 --> 00:52:02,345
Speaker 4:  just had speakers in a living room, some travel

887
00:52:02,345 --> 00:52:05,905
Speaker 4:  Bluetooth speakers, their new speaker that can do both Google

888
00:52:05,905 --> 00:52:09,225
Speaker 4:  Assistant and Alexa on the same device, which is really cool. And they just

889
00:52:09,225 --> 00:52:11,945
Speaker 4:  put 'em all in the room and they pushed all the, they pushed buttons and

890
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:15,385
Speaker 4:  the Bluetooth speakers, the little travel JBL Bluetooth speakers became the

891
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:17,545
Speaker 4:  rears in a home theater situation.

892
00:52:17,545 --> 00:52:18,665
Speaker 5:  Whoa. Okay. That's cool.

893
00:52:19,055 --> 00:52:23,025
Speaker 4:  It's cool. Yeah, like that's just cool that they like, they're, they're able

894
00:52:23,045 --> 00:52:26,345
Speaker 4:  to do this using a standard. It's not some proprietary stuff. And the idea

895
00:52:26,345 --> 00:52:28,585
Speaker 4:  is that you should be able to do it with all the speakers you have in your

896
00:52:28,585 --> 00:52:32,185
Speaker 4:  house. Very cool. So Samsung is bringing Aura Cast to

897
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:36,385
Speaker 4:  tons of its products and then of course the TVs are getting 360

898
00:52:36,385 --> 00:52:38,145
Speaker 4:  reality audio in case you need Is

899
00:52:38,165 --> 00:52:40,065
Speaker 5:  Is, is the Frame TV gonna get Aura Cast?

900
00:52:42,065 --> 00:52:45,805
Speaker 4:  So the Frame TV is the weirdest kind

901
00:52:46,025 --> 00:52:49,525
Speaker 4:  of product. I could write 10,000 words about the Frame TV and I You're gonna

902
00:52:49,525 --> 00:52:50,245
Speaker 5:  Have to at some point.

903
00:52:50,545 --> 00:52:53,485
Speaker 4:  I'm obsessed with the, the existence of the Frame tv. The popular, the Frame

904
00:52:53,505 --> 00:52:54,485
Speaker 4:  TV is an old panel.

905
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:59,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah, thats one of the reasons like they mark it up is they take an old cheap

906
00:52:59,045 --> 00:52:59,245
Speaker 5:  panel.

907
00:52:59,245 --> 00:53:00,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They're just, they're just put a

908
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:01,285
Speaker 5:  Cool bezel on it.

909
00:53:01,505 --> 00:53:03,885
Speaker 4:  Bam. So they do some cool backlight stuff. So it goes to sleep mode. The

910
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:06,365
Speaker 4:  display dims, it's Matt, they've got the art store.

911
00:53:06,505 --> 00:53:08,125
Speaker 5:  You just said something nice about the Frame tv.

912
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:12,525
Speaker 4:  There is a, there is a little bit of work in the Frame TV that makes people

913
00:53:12,555 --> 00:53:15,885
Speaker 4:  want it. Yeah, because people watch TikTok, they don't watch their tv so

914
00:53:15,885 --> 00:53:19,325
Speaker 4:  they just want the artwork. Here's the thing that is driving me bananas about

915
00:53:19,325 --> 00:53:23,045
Speaker 4:  the Frame TV right now. Hmm. When you turn it off,

916
00:53:23,585 --> 00:53:27,245
Speaker 4:  it is not actually off. It goes into art mode, which is its special

917
00:53:27,585 --> 00:53:30,325
Speaker 4:  art mode. So then when you turn it off, it goes all the way off and then

918
00:53:30,325 --> 00:53:32,845
Speaker 4:  when you turn it back on again it comes all the way back on

919
00:53:33,265 --> 00:53:33,925
Speaker 5:  No art mode.

920
00:53:34,675 --> 00:53:35,605
Speaker 4:  Very confusing. So

921
00:53:35,605 --> 00:53:39,405
Speaker 5:  You have to go to get to art mode, you have to power on once the power on

922
00:53:39,405 --> 00:53:39,565
Speaker 5:  twice,

923
00:53:39,915 --> 00:53:42,405
Speaker 4:  None of this matters If, you are a normal human being. Wait, it's like

924
00:53:42,405 --> 00:53:45,685
Speaker 6:  The thing where you pull the light switch once and it turns on, you pull

925
00:53:45,685 --> 00:53:48,165
Speaker 6:  it again and it dims and then again and it's off. But then If you pull it

926
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:52,045
Speaker 6:  again, it goes all the way on. That's a perfectly normal setup. That's

927
00:53:52,045 --> 00:53:52,965
Speaker 6:  exactly how that should

928
00:53:52,965 --> 00:53:54,085
Speaker 5:  Work. It's confusing,

929
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:57,805
Speaker 4:  But none of this matters. If, you are a normal human being who buys a Frame

930
00:53:57,805 --> 00:54:01,365
Speaker 4:  TV and puts it on the wall using the Samsung frame If. you buy any

931
00:54:01,495 --> 00:54:05,125
Speaker 4:  third party frame, it is more than likely that you will cover up the

932
00:54:05,145 --> 00:54:09,005
Speaker 4:  actual sensors that make the frame TV work, which is of course

933
00:54:09,005 --> 00:54:12,685
Speaker 4:  what we did. Yes. There is now a $99 dongle from

934
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:16,325
Speaker 4:  deco frames.com. It is an external, it's called the SRS two. It's huge.

935
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:20,845
Speaker 4:  It's just a sensor dongle for the frame tv. It is beautiful. No people

936
00:54:20,885 --> 00:54:24,725
Speaker 4:  hate it. You have to run another wired TV and then put a dongle out in the

937
00:54:24,725 --> 00:54:27,445
Speaker 4:  room because you've covered up at the sensors. So then you might think, if

938
00:54:27,445 --> 00:54:31,125
Speaker 4:  you're like me, what you're gonna do is you are already of course running

939
00:54:31,245 --> 00:54:34,645
Speaker 4:  a, a Raspberry Pi with HomeBridge. Yeah. You'll just put ties in into HomeBridge

940
00:54:34,645 --> 00:54:38,045
Speaker 4:  and control the frame TV using the other sensors that you might have in your

941
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:41,845
Speaker 4:  house. And then you'll realize that Samsung has taken the art mode

942
00:54:41,965 --> 00:54:45,885
Speaker 4:  API out of the 2022 and up frame TVs rude. So you cannot

943
00:54:46,235 --> 00:54:49,765
Speaker 4:  just tell the thing to turn on an art mode. You have to tell it to turn on

944
00:54:49,835 --> 00:54:53,565
Speaker 4:  running into the problem in which your wife keeps watching the

945
00:54:53,885 --> 00:54:57,805
Speaker 4:  horrible couples therapy show on Showtime. And she keeps turning the TV off

946
00:54:57,805 --> 00:55:01,405
Speaker 4:  at night so that when it turns on at eight 30 in the morning when your

947
00:55:01,405 --> 00:55:04,325
Speaker 4:  thermostat in your bedroom detects motion, it turns on and starts playing

948
00:55:04,325 --> 00:55:08,045
Speaker 4:  couples therapy at you. This is very bad. And the solution to this problem

949
00:55:08,345 --> 00:55:12,005
Speaker 4:  is there's only two. One, you can take the frame off your tv,

950
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:17,725
Speaker 4:  but Samsung doesn't solve a black frame. Or you have to tell your wife

951
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:21,645
Speaker 4:  who is a divorce lawyer that she's turning off the TV wrong.

952
00:55:22,785 --> 00:55:23,565
Speaker 5:  How you doing buddy?

953
00:55:24,275 --> 00:55:28,085
Speaker 4:  It's bad. I just, the TV is just off all the time. Like we don't know

954
00:55:28,085 --> 00:55:32,005
Speaker 4:  what to do. Just don't use it anymore. We reached it in past like I'm just

955
00:55:32,005 --> 00:55:34,805
Speaker 4:  turning the thing on manually in the morning and leaving that couldn't,

956
00:55:35,005 --> 00:55:37,605
Speaker 5:  Couldn't my home assistant change the channel for you.

957
00:55:37,755 --> 00:55:41,605
Speaker 4:  There's no channel because art mode is not a channel or an input. It is off.

958
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,085
Speaker 5:  Has somebody made like a third party art mode?

959
00:55:45,355 --> 00:55:46,805
Speaker 4:  It's just like a USB stick.

960
00:55:48,315 --> 00:55:51,565
Speaker 5:  Just like I just wanted to get like as janky as possible for

961
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:55,325
Speaker 4:  You. It's bad and I, no one knows what they took the API out of if all they

962
00:55:55,325 --> 00:55:57,925
Speaker 4:  need to do is put the end point back on. So you can just say go into art

963
00:55:57,925 --> 00:55:58,325
Speaker 4:  mode. Maybe

964
00:55:58,325 --> 00:55:59,685
Speaker 5:  It was a bug. Maybe somebody just

965
00:56:00,205 --> 00:56:01,245
Speaker 4:  Realized you can sort of fake

966
00:56:01,245 --> 00:56:01,405
Speaker 5:  It

967
00:56:02,355 --> 00:56:05,045
Speaker 4:  Because you can tell HomeBridge

968
00:56:06,465 --> 00:56:09,595
Speaker 4:  this is very dumb. I love this. You can create a virtual power button.

969
00:56:10,345 --> 00:56:14,275
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And have HomeKit push it. Yes. But then you have to guess

970
00:56:14,295 --> 00:56:15,715
Speaker 4:  how the TV was turned off at night.

971
00:56:16,185 --> 00:56:16,795
Speaker 5:  Beautiful.

972
00:56:17,105 --> 00:56:20,995
Speaker 4:  It's bad. All this is bad. Beautiful forecast is good. Frame tv,

973
00:56:22,055 --> 00:56:23,985
Speaker 4:  bad nightmare situation. NELI,

974
00:56:24,065 --> 00:56:27,345
Speaker 6:  I just, I just, before we move on, I just want to congratulate you in, in

975
00:56:27,345 --> 00:56:30,945
Speaker 6:  the long history of The Vergecast, you have made what I would call many of

976
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:34,865
Speaker 6:  Eli's niche complaints. That was the most

977
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:39,345
Speaker 6:  niche complaint I have ever. The total addressable market of that complaint

978
00:56:39,345 --> 00:56:40,265
Speaker 6:  is it's every

979
00:56:40,515 --> 00:56:44,225
Speaker 4:  Frame TV owner, every frame TV owner has truck,

980
00:56:44,225 --> 00:56:44,865
Speaker 5:  They all use Homerage.

981
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:48,745
Speaker 4:  Go onto the frame TV sub corpus of Reddit

982
00:56:49,485 --> 00:56:53,105
Speaker 4:  and you will see an infinite number of people. There are

983
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:57,025
Speaker 4:  people in this world who have bought bulk fiber optic cable

984
00:56:57,525 --> 00:57:01,425
Speaker 4:  to read to and mirrors, to trick the

985
00:57:01,425 --> 00:57:04,225
Speaker 4:  sensors of the frame TV into seeing light. That

986
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:06,265
Speaker 5:  Has to be more expensive than the $90 dongle

987
00:57:06,735 --> 00:57:10,545
Speaker 6:  Also defeats the purpose of the beautiful television. That doesn't look like

988
00:57:10,545 --> 00:57:10,985
Speaker 6:  a television.

989
00:57:10,985 --> 00:57:14,865
Speaker 4:  No, no. 'cause they're drilling holes. Oh, into the frame. Put poking the

990
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:17,865
Speaker 4:  little fiber optic cable out of the frame than running the fiber optic cable

991
00:57:17,865 --> 00:57:21,585
Speaker 4:  to the sensor where it shines in. And this is a quote from the sub

992
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:25,585
Speaker 4:  corpus post into a disco ball of little mirrors that they've made

993
00:57:26,205 --> 00:57:29,985
Speaker 4:  so that the the, you can, the sensor can detect the change in light because

994
00:57:29,985 --> 00:57:32,025
Speaker 4:  otherwise you have to have the dumb sensor. Don't go out in the world

995
00:57:32,255 --> 00:57:32,545
Speaker 5:  When

996
00:57:32,855 --> 00:57:34,545
Speaker 6:  That solution kicks ass. It's awesome.

997
00:57:34,565 --> 00:57:38,345
Speaker 4:  The rules, it rules. That's I've, I've posted this onto the, onto the

998
00:57:38,345 --> 00:57:38,825
Speaker 4:  website. Are

999
00:57:38,825 --> 00:57:39,825
Speaker 5:  You gonna build a disco ball?

1000
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:43,745
Speaker 4:  I've thought our frame is metal So I haves like drill. It's not great.

1001
00:57:44,345 --> 00:57:48,145
Speaker 4:  I don't know what to do. But I will tell you one option is not you're turning

1002
00:57:48,205 --> 00:57:49,345
Speaker 4:  off the TV wrong.

1003
00:57:50,525 --> 00:57:52,865
Speaker 5:  No you, it's tough one. Nope. You can't do that. It's not

1004
00:57:53,365 --> 00:57:54,145
Speaker 4:  Not appropriate.

1005
00:57:56,745 --> 00:58:00,445
Speaker 4:  But then the TV turning night in the morning playing couples therapy

1006
00:58:00,585 --> 00:58:02,525
Speaker 4:  at is also not acceptable.

1007
00:58:03,555 --> 00:58:05,205
Speaker 5:  There's just no winning in that

1008
00:58:05,205 --> 00:58:06,805
Speaker 4:  One. Pierce wants your light here.

1009
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:11,765
Speaker 6:  Mine is a better screen. You can hang on your wall. That instead of causing

1010
00:58:11,825 --> 00:58:15,085
Speaker 6:  you infinite grief will solve quite a bit of your grief.

1011
00:58:15,765 --> 00:58:19,405
Speaker 6:  It's the Amazon Echo Hub, which was announced a while ago and the reviews

1012
00:58:19,405 --> 00:58:23,085
Speaker 6:  of it are starting to come out and it's starting to ship. I love this thing

1013
00:58:23,105 --> 00:58:26,885
Speaker 6:  and it is also like deeply funny that the Echo Hub needs to

1014
00:58:26,885 --> 00:58:30,845
Speaker 6:  exist. It's just a screen that you put on your wall to use

1015
00:58:30,865 --> 00:58:33,925
Speaker 6:  to control your smart home. Yeah, it is. It is

1016
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:38,725
Speaker 6:  the simplest thing you could imagine. Amazon basically took like a fire

1017
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:42,565
Speaker 6:  tablet or an Echo show and just took all the features out of it except the

1018
00:58:42,565 --> 00:58:45,645
Speaker 6:  buttons for controlling your lights. And then was like, do you want this

1019
00:58:45,645 --> 00:58:49,485
Speaker 6:  to hang on your wall? And everybody said, yes I do. And

1020
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:54,365
Speaker 6:  Genii reviewed it, really liked it, said it has like totally fit into her

1021
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:58,085
Speaker 6:  life and her family's. And to me this is just like we, we

1022
00:58:58,085 --> 00:59:01,685
Speaker 6:  need to finally get past the idea that, oh,

1023
00:59:02,185 --> 00:59:05,725
Speaker 6:  an app for your smartphone is the solution to this problem.

1024
00:59:05,995 --> 00:59:09,805
Speaker 6:  Like yes, no, it's not buttons on my wall or the

1025
00:59:10,085 --> 00:59:13,725
Speaker 6:  solution to this problem. Those buttons can be on screen, that's fine. But

1026
00:59:13,725 --> 00:59:17,525
Speaker 6:  like voice assistance ain't it? Apps on my phone, ain't it? Like

1027
00:59:17,525 --> 00:59:21,445
Speaker 6:  we need new systems for this stuff and kudos to Amazon for having

1028
00:59:21,885 --> 00:59:23,165
Speaker 6:  actually pushed at that.

1029
00:59:23,495 --> 00:59:26,565
Speaker 5:  Which do you think is gonna like affect more marriages?

1030
00:59:27,425 --> 00:59:31,325
Speaker 5:  The frame TV situation or the existence of the

1031
00:59:31,325 --> 00:59:31,525
Speaker 5:  Hub?

1032
00:59:31,665 --> 00:59:34,805
Speaker 6:  Oh, it's the existence of the Echo Hub. The number of of

1033
00:59:35,235 --> 00:59:35,925
Speaker 4:  Beleaguered

1034
00:59:35,925 --> 00:59:38,685
Speaker 6:  Partners of smart home nerds who

1035
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:43,125
Speaker 6:  now don't have to like, okay, so my sister

1036
00:59:43,415 --> 00:59:46,605
Speaker 6:  lives in a home with someone who is big into the smart home and she had to

1037
00:59:46,885 --> 00:59:50,525
Speaker 6:  memorize the names of her lamps so that she could tell Alexa

1038
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:54,125
Speaker 6:  which ones to turn on. And it's like there's the living room lamp, but then

1039
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:56,525
Speaker 6:  there's the big living room lamp and If. you just ask for one and not the

1040
00:59:56,525 --> 01:00:00,325
Speaker 6:  other. You're, and this is terrible, but you know what's great is when you

1041
01:00:00,325 --> 01:00:03,645
Speaker 6:  can walk up to the wall and flip a switch and I will happily

1042
01:00:04,445 --> 01:00:08,325
Speaker 6:  exchange that switch for a button but a person can figure out how to

1043
01:00:08,345 --> 01:00:11,325
Speaker 6:  use it. And that is terrific. And it's

1044
01:00:11,325 --> 01:00:13,845
Speaker 5:  Gonna be, I had to get one of those like hue light buttons back in the day

1045
01:00:14,145 --> 01:00:17,805
Speaker 5:  for when I had a roommate because after multiple times of me

1046
01:00:17,965 --> 01:00:20,605
Speaker 5:  accidentally turning off all the lights in the bathroom while she was in

1047
01:00:20,605 --> 01:00:20,925
Speaker 5:  the shower,

1048
01:00:22,195 --> 01:00:25,045
Speaker 4:  It's not good. Not good. Yeah. We should actually just have Jen on the show

1049
01:00:25,065 --> 01:00:27,605
Speaker 4:  so she can describe how her family deals with her job

1050
01:00:28,435 --> 01:00:29,045
Speaker 5:  Carefully.

1051
01:00:29,285 --> 01:00:33,125
Speaker 4:  'cause literally her teenage children are like, we are just gonna live

1052
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:34,885
Speaker 4:  in the dark. We're not gonna try to figure out how to

1053
01:00:35,235 --> 01:00:38,125
Speaker 6:  Well there's a whole lot of Jen on the show the next few weeks, by the way,

1054
01:00:38,145 --> 01:00:39,845
Speaker 6:  So, I get excited. I think

1055
01:00:40,885 --> 01:00:42,965
Speaker 4:  I, here's the thing about this Hub that I'm thinking about.

1056
01:00:44,065 --> 01:00:46,365
Speaker 5:  It doesn't sit flush. It sticks out a

1057
01:00:46,365 --> 01:00:48,605
Speaker 4:  Little. It sticks out a little. You gotta power all this, all the normal

1058
01:00:48,605 --> 01:00:52,525
Speaker 4:  stuff of putting screen wall. It's a product made for the matter. Smart Home

1059
01:00:52,845 --> 01:00:56,405
Speaker 4:  standard but Matter isn't good enough to support this product. Yeah, because

1060
01:00:56,405 --> 01:00:59,525
Speaker 4:  what you want is a bunch of smart home stuff in your house and you're like,

1061
01:00:59,525 --> 01:01:02,645
Speaker 4:  okay, I control most of it with my Android phone with Google Home. Or I control

1062
01:01:02,645 --> 01:01:06,405
Speaker 4:  it with HomeKit on my phone or my iOS phone. And then I bought this awesome

1063
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:10,285
Speaker 4:  screen from Amazon and it's also a great smart home controller. And

1064
01:01:10,305 --> 01:01:14,125
Speaker 4:  the reality of this product is like, it's great if all your shit's in Alexa.

1065
01:01:14,435 --> 01:01:18,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it does have a ZigBee radio. Right. It's a

1066
01:01:18,365 --> 01:01:21,405
Speaker 4:  matter control. It is. It's got like a, it's ready for The future

1067
01:01:21,785 --> 01:01:22,525
Speaker 5:  Of stuff. Yeah.

1068
01:01:22,585 --> 01:01:26,285
Speaker 4:  But the way you want it to work, like the way I'd want it to work. I do

1069
01:01:26,285 --> 01:01:29,845
Speaker 4:  everything at HomeKit because the idea of getting anyone else in my family

1070
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:33,965
Speaker 4:  to do any to open another app besides control

1071
01:01:33,965 --> 01:01:35,405
Speaker 4:  center is not happening.

1072
01:01:35,845 --> 01:01:39,035
Speaker 5:  I feel like, I feel like you'll probably like

1073
01:01:40,245 --> 01:01:43,445
Speaker 5:  somebody will have a solution pretty quickly for HomeKit users and other

1074
01:01:43,445 --> 01:01:47,405
Speaker 5:  folks to use this thing through Matter. 'cause matter kind of sucks but like

1075
01:01:47,405 --> 01:01:48,205
Speaker 5:  HomeBridge But

1076
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:49,845
Speaker 4:  Matter should be the thing. It

1077
01:01:49,845 --> 01:01:50,685
Speaker 5:  Should be. But it's

1078
01:01:50,685 --> 01:01:53,685
Speaker 4:  Right. Like you should, you should be setting everything up in any one of

1079
01:01:53,685 --> 01:01:57,605
Speaker 4:  these ecosystems and then you're like, I've added a matter device that

1080
01:01:57,605 --> 01:02:00,325
Speaker 4:  can see all those rooms and see all those devices

1081
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:05,325
Speaker 4:  and it, it we're so close. I feel like Jen writes the we're so close with

1082
01:02:05,325 --> 01:02:08,765
Speaker 4:  Matter story, like it's the heart of every story about these devices right

1083
01:02:08,765 --> 01:02:11,085
Speaker 5:  Now. She likes size as she writes it, she's like, oh

1084
01:02:11,085 --> 01:02:13,965
Speaker 4:  We're so, she actually has an automation setup where she just sized loudly

1085
01:02:13,965 --> 01:02:17,245
Speaker 4:  into a microphone and ChatGPT writes the matter isn't quite there yet. Story.

1086
01:02:17,795 --> 01:02:21,645
Speaker 4:  It's very good. Alright, we should take another break. And we're back with

1087
01:02:21,925 --> 01:02:25,565
Speaker 4:  a non gadget lightning round. This one will have fewer front

1088
01:02:25,705 --> 01:02:27,245
Speaker 4:  TVs in it. I promise you. We'll be right back.

1089
01:02:56,615 --> 01:02:56,935
Speaker 9:  safely.

1090
01:04:01,635 --> 01:04:05,375
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. Lemme tell you about Tizen, the

1091
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:06,335
Speaker 4:  software that powers the frame.

1092
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:06,975
Speaker 10:  No,

1093
01:04:08,715 --> 01:04:09,455
Speaker 6:  We are so close.

1094
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:13,175
Speaker 4:  I'm telling you, I could write 10,000 words about what the frame TV represents

1095
01:04:13,175 --> 01:04:13,575
Speaker 4:  in our culture.

1096
01:04:13,845 --> 01:04:17,095
Speaker 5:  It's gonna happen at some point. Yeah, we're gonna like be like, Nila, you

1097
01:04:17,095 --> 01:04:20,255
Speaker 5:  can't work at all for the next week. Just write 10,000 words on Vizio.

1098
01:04:20,555 --> 01:04:21,655
Speaker 4:  I'm just, I like

1099
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:25,455
Speaker 6:  The the like one for me, one for them thing. You're like, okay. I wrote Welcome

1100
01:04:25,455 --> 01:04:27,815
Speaker 6:  to Hell Elon. A lot of people read that. That was great. Now I'm gonna write

1101
01:04:27,815 --> 01:04:28,935
Speaker 6:  a feature about Tyson.

1102
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:33,495
Speaker 4:  This looks for me, I heard this. I write to

1103
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:36,055
Speaker 4:  David David at The Verge dot com. If you'd like me to write 10,000 words

1104
01:04:36,075 --> 01:04:40,055
Speaker 4:  on the frame tv. Please do. Yes please.

1105
01:04:41,765 --> 01:04:44,865
Speaker 4:  I'm just gonna say this, I think the Frame TV is Samsung's most important

1106
01:04:44,865 --> 01:04:45,985
Speaker 4:  product. I mean

1107
01:04:46,065 --> 01:04:46,745
Speaker 5:  I I think you're right.

1108
01:04:47,245 --> 01:04:51,185
Speaker 4:  It is. It is by far. It is the one that they invented. They invent

1109
01:04:51,185 --> 01:04:54,865
Speaker 4:  like they didn't, it's not a copy of anything. Even I know some Samsung

1110
01:04:54,865 --> 01:04:58,105
Speaker 4:  people, they invented a lot of stuff. For example, Samsung invented the concept

1111
01:04:58,205 --> 01:05:01,905
Speaker 4:  of taking fake photos of the moon. Very important concept. But the Frame

1112
01:05:01,925 --> 01:05:05,745
Speaker 4:  TV they just invented. There wasn't a thing and then they made a thing. And

1113
01:05:05,745 --> 01:05:09,665
Speaker 4:  then the thing is very successful. Other copy are copying the thing. but

1114
01:05:09,685 --> 01:05:13,665
Speaker 4:  it is as a cultural object that people desire. The

1115
01:05:13,665 --> 01:05:15,185
Speaker 4:  Frame TV is top of the list for Samsung.

1116
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:16,065
Speaker 5:  Remember when it was in the

1117
01:05:16,065 --> 01:05:19,085
Speaker 4:  MoMA that and the weird bespoke appliances they make.

1118
01:05:19,865 --> 01:05:20,325
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah.

1119
01:05:20,745 --> 01:05:24,525
Speaker 4:  People like this, but whatever. Yeah. All right. Non

1120
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:28,415
Speaker 4:  gadget. Lightning round. David, I think yours, we've

1121
01:05:28,415 --> 01:05:30,055
Speaker 4:  got an hour to do on this one. Go ahead. Yes.

1122
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:32,535
Speaker 6:  Easily an hour to do on this one. So we are

1123
01:05:32,635 --> 01:05:33,535
Speaker 4:  Bad at Lightning.

1124
01:05:34,255 --> 01:05:37,935
Speaker 6:  I know. This one actually I don't think will be that long. And I am desperate

1125
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:41,055
Speaker 6:  to hear people's feedback because I have been hearing people's feedback nonstop

1126
01:05:41,155 --> 01:05:45,055
Speaker 6:  for two days. And I'm just a glutton for punishment. Apple launch an

1127
01:05:45,055 --> 01:05:48,655
Speaker 6:  app called Apple Sports, which is a very simple app

1128
01:05:49,035 --> 01:05:52,735
Speaker 6:  for seeing sports scores. It's not a very good app. It's missing a lot of

1129
01:05:52,735 --> 01:05:55,695
Speaker 6:  sports. It shows lineups in a sort of

1130
01:05:56,375 --> 01:06:00,215
Speaker 6:  deranged, nonsensical way. but it does in fact for

1131
01:06:00,365 --> 01:06:03,575
Speaker 6:  some sports sometimes show scores.

1132
01:06:04,275 --> 01:06:08,055
Speaker 6:  And there is either less

1133
01:06:08,075 --> 01:06:11,655
Speaker 6:  to this app than I think. And it's just kind of a weird side project that

1134
01:06:11,655 --> 01:06:15,495
Speaker 6:  like Eddie Q found on somebody's computer and shipped

1135
01:06:16,275 --> 01:06:19,735
Speaker 6:  or this is a harbinger of huge things to come.

1136
01:06:20,275 --> 01:06:24,015
Speaker 6:  And I posited that there are two things that are possible for Apple

1137
01:06:24,015 --> 01:06:27,855
Speaker 6:  sports. One is that Apple is about to make even

1138
01:06:27,925 --> 01:06:31,895
Speaker 6:  more big moves into sports streaming, which I think there are lots of

1139
01:06:31,895 --> 01:06:35,775
Speaker 6:  reasons for and we can talk about. The other one is that this is

1140
01:06:35,775 --> 01:06:39,735
Speaker 6:  the app you would launch If. you wanted to get into betting in

1141
01:06:40,015 --> 01:06:42,055
Speaker 6:  interesting ways. one of the controversial things that has been in this app

1142
01:06:42,055 --> 01:06:44,775
Speaker 6:  so far is you can see betting odds for all the games that you're looking

1143
01:06:44,775 --> 01:06:48,095
Speaker 6:  at, which is powered by DraftKings. I would point out you can turn it off

1144
01:06:48,095 --> 01:06:52,055
Speaker 6:  in settings, but it's on by default. And I posited that this

1145
01:06:52,055 --> 01:06:55,455
Speaker 6:  is what it would look like if Apple were to very slowly start getting into

1146
01:06:55,455 --> 01:06:59,335
Speaker 6:  sports gambling. And many hundreds of people have told me how

1147
01:06:59,335 --> 01:07:02,855
Speaker 6:  dumb I am for that take. And I continue to believe that I'm correct.

1148
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:06,015
Speaker 5:  I feel like you're probably correct, but also like that's the worst

1149
01:07:07,305 --> 01:07:09,575
Speaker 5:  thing. I don't want you to be correct. So,

1150
01:07:09,575 --> 01:07:13,255
Speaker 6:  But this is what I wanna talk about because I think that

1151
01:07:13,355 --> 01:07:17,175
Speaker 6:  the, the Overton window on sports gambling has moved

1152
01:07:17,515 --> 01:07:21,455
Speaker 6:  so far that the idea that this is somehow against Apple's

1153
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:24,775
Speaker 6:  brand to do is just no longer the truth.

1154
01:07:25,815 --> 01:07:29,675
Speaker 6:  And I like sports gambling is just life. It's just mainstream

1155
01:07:29,705 --> 01:07:30,275
Speaker 6:  life. Now

1156
01:07:30,435 --> 01:07:33,635
Speaker 5:  I saw the 60 Minutes episode about this a couple of weeks ago. It's true.

1157
01:07:33,635 --> 01:07:33,795
Speaker 5:  Oh

1158
01:07:33,795 --> 01:07:34,555
Speaker 6:  Really? Was there one

1159
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:36,195
Speaker 5:  Neil? I had to listen to me talk about it at the office.

1160
01:07:36,295 --> 01:07:38,755
Speaker 4:  One of the things about working with Alex that I think the listener should

1161
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:42,715
Speaker 4:  know is every now and again she comes up all revved up on 60

1162
01:07:42,715 --> 01:07:42,995
Speaker 4:  Minutes.

1163
01:07:44,665 --> 01:07:47,875
Speaker 4:  It's just like, it's just a delight. It's just very confusing. Yeah, it is.

1164
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:50,795
Speaker 4:  It is very much like working with a, like a hotheaded retiree.

1165
01:07:52,025 --> 01:07:55,035
Speaker 5:  Then I take my Metamucil and have a nap. It's great.

1166
01:07:56,195 --> 01:07:59,315
Speaker 4:  A dedicated viewer. 60 minutes. Yeah. Which does make some very good journalism

1167
01:07:59,315 --> 01:08:00,955
Speaker 4:  I think sometimes. Yeah, for some people.

1168
01:08:03,215 --> 01:08:06,795
Speaker 4:  But it's, it's true that it's 60 minutes to do a gambling is bad. It's very

1169
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:10,275
Speaker 4:  addictive. I agree. If, you are Tim Cook

1170
01:08:10,655 --> 01:08:14,275
Speaker 4:  and you're looking at declining sales, you're looking at Buring services

1171
01:08:14,275 --> 01:08:18,205
Speaker 4:  revenue. Dude. What is the ultimate services business? Just taking

1172
01:08:18,205 --> 01:08:22,165
Speaker 4:  money from people. Yep. Just, just directly extracting

1173
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:26,005
Speaker 4:  money from people. Give us some money and maybe this machine will give you

1174
01:08:26,005 --> 01:08:29,805
Speaker 4:  some money back. But not all the time. In fact, not most of the time. And

1175
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:33,285
Speaker 4:  If, you're in Las Vegas, you're standing in a monument to how little

1176
01:08:33,535 --> 01:08:36,765
Speaker 4:  money the machine will give back to you and people still give money to the

1177
01:08:36,765 --> 01:08:40,405
Speaker 4:  machine. And you have to imagine Tim Cook stands, he sat in this sphere

1178
01:08:41,195 --> 01:08:45,125
Speaker 4:  looking at Bono going, I gotta get in on this. And

1179
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:46,165
Speaker 4:  then we have the sports app.

1180
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:49,045
Speaker 5:  Isn't gambling not allowed in the app store?

1181
01:08:50,775 --> 01:08:52,905
Speaker 5:  Like is there weirdness around this? I

1182
01:08:52,905 --> 01:08:54,705
Speaker 4:  Thought it was a lot, but it depends. It depends.

1183
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:55,905
Speaker 5:  Yeah. There's like,

1184
01:08:56,575 --> 01:08:57,065
Speaker 4:  Depends.

1185
01:08:57,065 --> 01:08:57,305
Speaker 5:  There's

1186
01:08:57,305 --> 01:08:59,905
Speaker 4:  Lines. It depends. So FanDuel and or FanDuel and DraftKings are in the app

1187
01:08:59,905 --> 01:09:02,505
Speaker 4:  store, right? Yep. You just get those apps. So it depends like so FanDuel

1188
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:06,305
Speaker 4:  and DraftKings are just in the app store. You can just do it. It's legal

1189
01:09:06,325 --> 01:09:10,105
Speaker 4:  in some states. I think App Apple doesn't. Apple has some weird lines about

1190
01:09:10,135 --> 01:09:12,625
Speaker 4:  what it allows when it's legal and not legal. But

1191
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:14,585
Speaker 5:  If I just wanted to play the digital slots,

1192
01:09:14,855 --> 01:09:18,785
Speaker 4:  Nope. Games of chance are not allowed in the absolute

1193
01:09:18,805 --> 01:09:22,155
Speaker 5:  And that feels weird to me. Like it feels

1194
01:09:22,435 --> 01:09:25,995
Speaker 5:  disingenuous if you're gonna, if you're going to let gambling happen. Well,

1195
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:29,235
Speaker 4:  So here, here's, I think we should make this distinction right now. Okay.

1196
01:09:29,495 --> 01:09:33,355
Speaker 4:  And David, I think this is my pushback on your, this is Apple getting into

1197
01:09:33,515 --> 01:09:36,955
Speaker 4:  gambling. Yes. Even when gambling is morally frowned upon, right? When it

1198
01:09:36,955 --> 01:09:40,795
Speaker 4:  was not legal in most places and whatever the newspapers would print the

1199
01:09:40,795 --> 01:09:44,435
Speaker 4:  lines. Sure. Left and right. Old school football

1200
01:09:44,435 --> 01:09:48,235
Speaker 4:  announcers at the end of blowouts would be like, only a

1201
01:09:48,235 --> 01:09:51,715
Speaker 4:  handful of people are interested in this field goal. And they were making

1202
01:09:51,865 --> 01:09:55,675
Speaker 4:  very direct references to like whether your bookie is gonna show up and break

1203
01:09:55,675 --> 01:09:59,635
Speaker 4:  your arm. Yeah. That's basically what they were doing. So it

1204
01:09:59,635 --> 01:10:02,915
Speaker 4:  was always part, it's always been part of sports culture. So to have a Scores

1205
01:10:03,095 --> 01:10:07,035
Speaker 4:  app where you can see odds is not at all a

1206
01:10:07,235 --> 01:10:11,155
Speaker 4:  departure from what the local newspaper in Racine Wisconsin did when

1207
01:10:11,155 --> 01:10:15,115
Speaker 4:  I was growing up, but powered by DraftKings in

1208
01:10:15,115 --> 01:10:18,355
Speaker 4:  an app store where it is part of the mainstream culture where if you're trying

1209
01:10:18,355 --> 01:10:22,115
Speaker 4:  to grow your services revenue, boy that seems like a big, big pot of money.

1210
01:10:22,705 --> 01:10:22,995
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1211
01:10:23,215 --> 01:10:27,115
Speaker 6:  And also If, you If you launched a newspaper in which one of the only

1212
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:30,555
Speaker 6:  two things you could do was look at the betting odds. Don't you think you'd

1213
01:10:30,605 --> 01:10:32,155
Speaker 6:  maybe think of that slightly differently?

1214
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:36,675
Speaker 4:  Well, I dunno, like the, the New York Times ones, the athletic, the athletic

1215
01:10:36,675 --> 01:10:39,635
Speaker 4:  will straight up be like run articles that are like, here's how to bet today.

1216
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:40,075
Speaker 4:  Sure.

1217
01:10:40,075 --> 01:10:40,315
Speaker 6:  Wait,

1218
01:10:40,505 --> 01:10:44,155
Speaker 5:  Were the, I know some of the, the scores and stuff weren't

1219
01:10:44,555 --> 01:10:48,395
Speaker 5:  accurate. Were the sports odds, were the odds accurate in the Apple

1220
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:51,435
Speaker 6:  App? I haven't checked, to be honest. I I have not heard complaints that

1221
01:10:51,435 --> 01:10:52,995
Speaker 6:  they're not. But I, I couldn't

1222
01:10:52,995 --> 01:10:55,635
Speaker 4:  Tell you. John Gruber had a piece where he pointed out that Traffickings

1223
01:10:55,635 --> 01:10:59,235
Speaker 4:  has weird odds. Mm. 'cause they're all d because it's ga it's gambling.

1224
01:10:59,345 --> 01:11:02,875
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like they, they odds are, are odds are set by odds makers. People have

1225
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:05,595
Speaker 4:  different ideas. I think it is fascinating that they made this app. I think

1226
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:08,995
Speaker 4:  it's rushed because they needed to get out before the MLS season kicked off,

1227
01:11:08,995 --> 01:11:12,795
Speaker 4:  which they own. Right. So they have a huge opportunity to promote their own

1228
01:11:12,795 --> 01:11:16,605
Speaker 4:  sports app ahead of it. Is this anything other than a toy

1229
01:11:16,745 --> 01:11:20,645
Speaker 4:  for Betty EQ remains unclear

1230
01:11:21,185 --> 01:11:22,645
Speaker 5:  Or is Tim Cook your new bookie?

1231
01:11:23,365 --> 01:11:24,365
Speaker 4:  I love the idea of Tim

1232
01:11:24,985 --> 01:11:28,805
Speaker 5:  In my head hat and in my head he's wearing like a little hat. Do

1233
01:11:28,805 --> 01:11:29,965
Speaker 5:  Bookie still wear little hats?

1234
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:34,325
Speaker 4:  No. Tim Cook is a bookie would be an absolutely terrifying character.

1235
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:35,525
Speaker 6:  Like Oh

1236
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:39,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no hat, no costume. He would win. Just actually Tim Cook in his

1237
01:11:39,205 --> 01:11:41,925
Speaker 4:  sweater being like, go get the money. Yeah.

1238
01:11:41,925 --> 01:11:45,045
Speaker 6:  He's the guy you like are in your house and you turn around and he's just

1239
01:11:45,045 --> 01:11:47,965
Speaker 6:  been standing there for Who knows how long. Like that's Tim Cook. The person

1240
01:11:47,965 --> 01:11:48,165
Speaker 6:  who

1241
01:11:48,165 --> 01:11:51,685
Speaker 5:  Plays him in the film adaptation would win an Oscar immediately for their,

1242
01:11:51,685 --> 01:11:52,485
Speaker 5:  their portrayal.

1243
01:11:52,985 --> 01:11:56,005
Speaker 4:  No, he's not in your house. The the heavies are in the house. Tim Cook is

1244
01:11:56,005 --> 01:11:58,485
Speaker 4:  the guy where he is like he's on the phone with you. The heavies grab you,

1245
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:01,845
Speaker 4:  they throw you into the back of the van. Oh. You get thrown outta the van

1246
01:12:01,845 --> 01:12:05,005
Speaker 4:  and you're in a very nice restaurant where he's quietly eating melon and

1247
01:12:05,005 --> 01:12:08,365
Speaker 4:  he is like, sit down and have some melon. And then like in that moment it

1248
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:11,965
Speaker 4:  becomes very clear to you that you're going to die. Yeah. Right. And you

1249
01:12:11,965 --> 01:12:15,045
Speaker 4:  better, you can either enjoy the melonin dye or you can not enjoy the melon

1250
01:12:15,045 --> 01:12:18,845
Speaker 4:  or die. But the whether or not you're dying has been long

1251
01:12:18,855 --> 01:12:19,725
Speaker 4:  since determined

1252
01:12:19,945 --> 01:12:21,045
Speaker 5:  All because you use the sports

1253
01:12:21,105 --> 01:12:24,885
Speaker 4:  App and that's how Tim Cook gets extracts excellent pricing on Ola screens.

1254
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:29,285
Speaker 6:  Enjoy the melanin dye as a show that Apple TV Plus would run for sure.

1255
01:12:31,465 --> 01:12:35,045
Speaker 6:  No, but we should move on. But my, my only point is that I think

1256
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:39,125
Speaker 6:  people are overestimating the gap between where Apple is

1257
01:12:39,225 --> 01:12:43,165
Speaker 6:  now and the Apple that just more or less runs a

1258
01:12:43,165 --> 01:12:46,285
Speaker 6:  betting service. Like the stuff you're describing. The only difference between

1259
01:12:46,285 --> 01:12:49,685
Speaker 6:  the digital slots that Apple won't let you do and the ones that it will let

1260
01:12:49,685 --> 01:12:53,365
Speaker 6:  you do is that you can pay money to win virtual stuff, but you can't pay

1261
01:12:53,365 --> 01:12:56,725
Speaker 6:  money to make actual money. And I don't think that's that big a gap. Like

1262
01:12:56,725 --> 01:12:59,485
Speaker 6:  do you wanna play Monopoly, go and pour all of your money into getting more

1263
01:12:59,485 --> 01:13:02,485
Speaker 6:  turns in Monopoly Go. Do you know what that is? That's gambling. You just

1264
01:13:02,485 --> 01:13:04,125
Speaker 6:  can't win anything. Yeah.

1265
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:05,045
Speaker 4:  That's loot boxes.

1266
01:13:05,345 --> 01:13:09,285
Speaker 6:  That's loot boxes. That is the same thing except there's no actual real

1267
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:12,965
Speaker 6:  world monetary upside for you. And I think the, the gap

1268
01:13:12,965 --> 01:13:16,565
Speaker 6:  between that and them saying, oh, just place your bet

1269
01:13:16,795 --> 01:13:20,365
Speaker 6:  with Apple Pay is like this small, it's this small

1270
01:13:20,615 --> 01:13:23,805
Speaker 5:  Draft Kings out there negotiating less than a 30% cut.

1271
01:13:24,945 --> 01:13:28,805
Speaker 4:  Are you kidding? Draft? There's a 50% cut. That's what they call

1272
01:13:28,805 --> 01:13:29,525
Speaker 4:  the melon cut.

1273
01:13:32,355 --> 01:13:36,205
Speaker 4:  There's no way. All right. What's your, what's your non

1274
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:37,565
Speaker 4:  gadget Lightning round it, it's

1275
01:13:37,565 --> 01:13:41,525
Speaker 5:  Still on the apple front. And that's because Apple has just announced that

1276
01:13:41,525 --> 01:13:45,485
Speaker 5:  they're doing post quantum cryptography for iMessage.

1277
01:13:45,705 --> 01:13:49,325
Speaker 5:  So all of our international listeners, I'm sorry this doesn't apply to you.

1278
01:13:49,935 --> 01:13:53,445
Speaker 5:  Enjoy your WhatsApp and, and other other services and continue to wonder

1279
01:13:53,445 --> 01:13:56,925
Speaker 5:  why we all care about iMessage here in the us But for I, for for

1280
01:13:57,505 --> 01:14:01,405
Speaker 5:  US users, it's kind of exciting. They're claiming it is more

1281
01:14:01,505 --> 01:14:04,645
Speaker 5:  secure than signals post quantum

1282
01:14:04,765 --> 01:14:07,245
Speaker 5:  cryptography that it rolled out a couple of months ago,

1283
01:14:09,075 --> 01:14:12,605
Speaker 5:  unclear they, you'll you'll enjoy this. They, they also

1284
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:16,965
Speaker 5:  created their own like metrics for security and they

1285
01:14:16,965 --> 01:14:20,245
Speaker 5:  said, well, signal's a level two, but we're a level three

1286
01:14:20,545 --> 01:14:23,485
Speaker 4:  Ooh. Love to put yourself on the good metric that you've made up.

1287
01:14:23,515 --> 01:14:25,365
Speaker 6:  Classic unmarked graph from

1288
01:14:25,365 --> 01:14:27,285
Speaker 5:  Apple. Yeah. I was just like, I was like beautiful.

1289
01:14:27,595 --> 01:14:31,325
Speaker 6:  Just imagine a line that just says security and Apple

1290
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:35,285
Speaker 6:  is up high and the other ones are lower, but there's no labels on

1291
01:14:35,285 --> 01:14:36,245
Speaker 6:  any of the graphs. Yeah.

1292
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:40,765
Speaker 5:  That's that's it. Yeah. That, that's it. It's, it is

1293
01:14:41,005 --> 01:14:44,685
Speaker 5:  exciting because as we get closer to quantum computers actually doing something

1294
01:14:44,735 --> 01:14:47,845
Speaker 5:  which will one day happen, like it, it's gonna happen.

1295
01:14:48,585 --> 01:14:52,365
Speaker 5:  All the cryptography we have now will not hold up. You'll be able to just

1296
01:14:52,365 --> 01:14:55,885
Speaker 5:  like brute force a lot of things one one day. And so

1297
01:14:56,365 --> 01:14:59,445
Speaker 5:  introducing post quantum cryptography is kind of necessary for a lot of people.

1298
01:14:59,445 --> 01:15:03,045
Speaker 5:  So it's exciting to see Apple doing that. But also we need to talk to like

1299
01:15:03,045 --> 01:15:06,045
Speaker 5:  some security researchers. There's a lot more to be done here. 'cause Apple

1300
01:15:06,105 --> 01:15:07,925
Speaker 5:  is just like we did it. Yeah. Everybody's like,

1301
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:11,965
Speaker 4:  This is two announcements from Apple this week. Yeah. On the same with the

1302
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:15,445
Speaker 4:  same sort of valence. One is we've defeated quantum

1303
01:15:15,805 --> 01:15:19,725
Speaker 4:  computers, which well done. Okay. We, I'm, I've come in first

1304
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:22,445
Speaker 4:  in a race that I've made up. Yeah. And then two, they announced that the

1305
01:15:22,445 --> 01:15:26,005
Speaker 4:  iPhone 15 battery performs better than expected, but they didn't say how

1306
01:15:26,005 --> 01:15:29,125
Speaker 4:  well they expected it or how much better than its expectations.

1307
01:15:29,185 --> 01:15:31,845
Speaker 5:  You know, they're gonna drop a chart. You can determine your own accesses

1308
01:15:31,865 --> 01:15:35,085
Speaker 5:  for it. Yeah. Yeah. It's gonna be great. But this, this, this was just like

1309
01:15:35,085 --> 01:15:38,925
Speaker 5:  kind of a cool thing. I, I think Quantum cryptography is gonna become more

1310
01:15:38,925 --> 01:15:42,305
Speaker 5:  important in the next 10 years, 20 years

1311
01:15:42,825 --> 01:15:46,345
Speaker 5:  whenever quantum computing actually becomes useful. But for now it's just

1312
01:15:46,345 --> 01:15:47,105
Speaker 5:  like, okay, that's nice.

1313
01:15:47,405 --> 01:15:49,545
Speaker 4:  You should, by the way, if you're really interested in this, we'll link to

1314
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:53,425
Speaker 4:  this. We just had the head of IBM quantum research on decoder.

1315
01:15:53,445 --> 01:15:56,865
Speaker 4:  We actually talked about whether or not you need a post quantum cryptography.

1316
01:15:57,125 --> 01:15:59,105
Speaker 4:  And his answer was like, I wouldn't worry about it.

1317
01:15:59,725 --> 01:16:02,785
Speaker 5:  It it's like, it's not a big deal right now, but it's still like That's cool.

1318
01:16:02,935 --> 01:16:03,225
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1319
01:16:03,605 --> 01:16:07,545
Speaker 6:  Did you ask NELI on decoder when I need to start actually

1320
01:16:07,785 --> 01:16:09,545
Speaker 6:  learning what a quantum computer is?

1321
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:13,105
Speaker 4:  I did. I also asked him how he feels about the movie and, and the was Quantum

1322
01:16:13,195 --> 01:16:13,545
Speaker 4:  mania

1323
01:16:15,365 --> 01:16:19,265
Speaker 4:  and he wasn't positive seems right. Yeah. He was

1324
01:16:19,265 --> 01:16:22,105
Speaker 4:  like, I'm happy people are thinking about Quantum computing.

1325
01:16:22,725 --> 01:16:22,945
Speaker 5:  Aw.

1326
01:16:23,535 --> 01:16:26,905
Speaker 4:  It's like, but I don't think there are entire civilization. I just feel like

1327
01:16:26,905 --> 01:16:28,585
Speaker 4:  it's a very good answer. It was a very politic,

1328
01:16:28,775 --> 01:16:32,505
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I got as far with Quantum computing as like it can be both

1329
01:16:32,825 --> 01:16:35,465
Speaker 6:  positive and negative at the same time and somehow that lets it store a lot

1330
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:38,385
Speaker 6:  of data. And I just went, well I don't get that. And that's the last thing

1331
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:39,625
Speaker 6:  I learned about quantum computing.

1332
01:16:39,865 --> 01:16:40,545
Speaker 5:  Somebody said cubits.

1333
01:16:40,545 --> 01:16:42,425
Speaker 4:  Alright, go. We'll link it. He go, David, it's a good episode. He's very

1334
01:16:42,545 --> 01:16:43,265
Speaker 4:  charming. Okay, cool.

1335
01:16:43,335 --> 01:16:44,225
Speaker 6:  I'll listen to it. It's

1336
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,665
Speaker 4:  Very good. All right. My lightning round

1337
01:16:48,335 --> 01:16:52,145
Speaker 4:  kind of some weird EV news. So Rivian is laying off

1338
01:16:52,145 --> 01:16:55,865
Speaker 4:  10% of its workforce. Ford is cutting mock

1339
01:16:56,025 --> 01:16:59,865
Speaker 4:  e prices. We're kind of in the second round of like the EV price scores.

1340
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:04,105
Speaker 4:  At any moment, Tesla's gonna start giving away model threes like their

1341
01:17:04,175 --> 01:17:06,345
Speaker 4:  Echo Dots. Yeah. you know, just like they're

1342
01:17:06,345 --> 01:17:08,865
Speaker 6:  Gonna show you Walmart ads and they'll give you a free car for it.

1343
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:13,725
Speaker 4:  It's, it feels like it's not so far off. Especially if Tesla gets

1344
01:17:13,725 --> 01:17:17,525
Speaker 4:  it self-driving first advertising the car is coming. Oh yeah. Twitter's gotta

1345
01:17:17,525 --> 01:17:18,565
Speaker 4:  sell ahead somehow. Yeah.

1346
01:17:20,665 --> 01:17:24,245
Speaker 4:  It, it does, it does feel like the overwhelming

1347
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:28,125
Speaker 4:  demand for Tesla model Wyze in threes in the middle of the

1348
01:17:28,285 --> 01:17:32,245
Speaker 4:  pandemic confused everyone into thinking that all anyone wanted was

1349
01:17:32,485 --> 01:17:36,245
Speaker 4:  Electric cars. And it was like over and so they all overproduced.

1350
01:17:37,055 --> 01:17:40,355
Speaker 4:  And then in, in particular for Rivian, I think this is really interesting.

1351
01:17:40,855 --> 01:17:44,355
Speaker 4:  you know, the R one T is a great truck. It's like a fun truck to drive. And

1352
01:17:44,355 --> 01:17:48,275
Speaker 4:  the R one s is a nice SUV. They're, they're so similar. It's hard to

1353
01:17:48,395 --> 01:17:51,715
Speaker 4:  actually talk about them as they're different cars. Like one's an SUV and

1354
01:17:51,715 --> 01:17:52,955
Speaker 4:  one's a truck, but they're, it's

1355
01:17:52,955 --> 01:17:56,035
Speaker 5:  Basically just like a camper shell was put on really, really nicely. Yeah.

1356
01:17:56,265 --> 01:17:56,555
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1357
01:17:57,015 --> 01:18:00,155
Speaker 4:  But like, well in a extremely well done way. Yeah. The people of R one Ss

1358
01:18:00,155 --> 01:18:01,675
Speaker 4:  love R one SS pristine

1359
01:18:01,775 --> 01:18:02,555
Speaker 5:  Camper shell.

1360
01:18:02,655 --> 01:18:05,875
Speaker 4:  But, but there's a reason There are ones, like, they're the same platform,

1361
01:18:06,665 --> 01:18:10,435
Speaker 4:  very, very similar vehicles. They're also hella expensive. Right. They're

1362
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:14,035
Speaker 4:  like a hundred thousand dollars at, at the top end trims. So Rivian just

1363
01:18:14,035 --> 01:18:17,755
Speaker 4:  has this problem where they thought they had infinite demand for these,

1364
01:18:18,095 --> 01:18:22,035
Speaker 4:  for EVs and then pickup trucks, really expensive pickup trucks

1365
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:27,465
Speaker 4:  were selling like hotcakes in the pandemic. So they were just like,

1366
01:18:27,465 --> 01:18:30,345
Speaker 4:  oh, this is great. This is working we'll overinvest in this. And then all

1367
01:18:30,345 --> 01:18:34,305
Speaker 4:  of that cooled off. Even the pickup truck market is like way down right now.

1368
01:18:34,575 --> 01:18:37,825
Speaker 4:  Like If, you are the sort of person who thinks about buying a Ram truck.

1369
01:18:38,485 --> 01:18:41,105
Speaker 4:  You can just, you can just get one in a way that you could not even a few

1370
01:18:41,225 --> 01:18:45,025
Speaker 4:  years ago, So I, think Rivian is just stuck 'cause they don't have a

1371
01:18:45,025 --> 01:18:48,545
Speaker 4:  cheaper car, which they're about to introduce the R two, which I think will

1372
01:18:48,545 --> 01:18:51,945
Speaker 4:  be really interesting and exciting and hopefully is cheaper. And then

1373
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:56,065
Speaker 4:  Ford has the Lightning and the Mach e and I think every person who wanted

1374
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:59,465
Speaker 4:  to buy a Lightning or a Mach e has purchased those cars and they got nothing

1375
01:18:59,465 --> 01:19:03,385
Speaker 4:  else. And I think we're just in a moment where there were, there were

1376
01:19:03,385 --> 01:19:07,065
Speaker 4:  so many vaporware cars for a minute and now there's like not

1377
01:19:07,065 --> 01:19:10,995
Speaker 4:  enough kinds of cars and like we're still in this, we're still in

1378
01:19:10,995 --> 01:19:13,875
Speaker 4:  the middle of what you would call the vaporware cycle. 'cause all the other

1379
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:17,635
Speaker 4:  cars we're supposed to fill out the market aren't there. So people

1380
01:19:17,635 --> 01:19:21,315
Speaker 4:  aren't even cross shopping EVs or cross shopping like two expensive

1381
01:19:22,155 --> 01:19:25,875
Speaker 4:  platinum whitenings against other trucks that

1382
01:19:26,015 --> 01:19:28,355
Speaker 4:  are on deep discount. 'cause they've been sitting in lots for forever.

1383
01:19:28,695 --> 01:19:32,355
Speaker 5:  And the, and the companies are all like heavily lobbying the

1384
01:19:32,395 --> 01:19:33,995
Speaker 5:  EPA right now. Right. To to, to

1385
01:19:33,995 --> 01:19:36,955
Speaker 4:  Reduce the, the restrictions that force them into basically selling EVs.

1386
01:19:36,955 --> 01:19:37,115
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1387
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:40,235
Speaker 5:  They're like, we nobody's buying and we don't actually wanna make as many

1388
01:19:40,295 --> 01:19:41,595
Speaker 5:  as we said we wanted to. Yeah.

1389
01:19:41,595 --> 01:19:43,595
Speaker 4:  And also interest rates are high and all this stuff. Yeah. But I think in

1390
01:19:43,595 --> 01:19:47,435
Speaker 4:  particular for Rivian, they just ran out of potential

1391
01:19:47,435 --> 01:19:49,475
Speaker 4:  buyers for a hundred thousand dollars pickup trucks.

1392
01:19:49,605 --> 01:19:52,835
Speaker 5:  There, there does seem like there's like a, a cap on the number of people

1393
01:19:52,835 --> 01:19:53,315
Speaker 5:  who do that.

1394
01:19:54,145 --> 01:19:54,435
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1395
01:19:54,845 --> 01:19:58,595
Speaker 5:  Seems like a, there's a really obvious cap for that.

1396
01:19:58,935 --> 01:20:02,595
Speaker 6:  Is there a bigger thing going on with just general

1397
01:20:03,895 --> 01:20:07,280
Speaker 6:  EV interest not rising as fast as people thought? Like there was, there was

1398
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:11,245
Speaker 6:  that interesting line from RJ Strange, the CEO said during the

1399
01:20:11,965 --> 01:20:15,885
Speaker 6:  earnings report. He said his quote was, how do we get the 93% of the market

1400
01:20:15,885 --> 01:20:19,685
Speaker 6:  that's not buying an EV to get excited about the product? Which

1401
01:20:19,705 --> 01:20:23,645
Speaker 6:  is not a problem. I think anyone in 2020 would've thought we would

1402
01:20:23,645 --> 01:20:24,885
Speaker 6:  have in 2024

1403
01:20:24,885 --> 01:20:28,805
Speaker 4:  Because the only car in the market in 2020 was Tesla. And there

1404
01:20:28,805 --> 01:20:32,565
Speaker 4:  was apparently infinite demand for the Tesla model three.

1405
01:20:32,665 --> 01:20:35,605
Speaker 6:  That's what I mean. But so are we, are we at a point where they've run out

1406
01:20:35,605 --> 01:20:39,165
Speaker 6:  of people to buy a hundred thousand dollars cars? Yes. Or are we at a point

1407
01:20:39,165 --> 01:20:41,765
Speaker 6:  where they've run out of people who wanna buy EVs? So

1408
01:20:41,765 --> 01:20:45,645
Speaker 4:  There, there are basically no head up competitors to the model three and

1409
01:20:45,645 --> 01:20:49,445
Speaker 4:  the Y There's the Mustang Mach E Right. Which is in a price war

1410
01:20:49,515 --> 01:20:52,845
Speaker 4:  with Tesla because Tesla keeps lowering its prices. And

1411
01:20:53,985 --> 01:20:56,685
Speaker 4:  you know, you can feel about the Mach E however you want. But that's a weird

1412
01:20:56,685 --> 01:21:00,445
Speaker 4:  place to be. Right. Where you're driving towards the bottom. And if

1413
01:21:01,085 --> 01:21:04,085
Speaker 4:  I think people who are interested in Teslas are not actually cross shopping

1414
01:21:04,085 --> 01:21:07,325
Speaker 4:  with Ford. Like, Tesla's still a very unique kind of buyer.

1415
01:21:08,025 --> 01:21:11,965
Speaker 4:  And you, I know people are gonna say it's morally irresponsible. They give

1416
01:21:11,965 --> 01:21:14,685
Speaker 4:  you all, but people who buy Teslas buy Teslas and they like them. That is

1417
01:21:14,685 --> 01:21:18,165
Speaker 4:  just a fact. Yeah. Then everything else is like crazy expensive. The Honda

1418
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:21,165
Speaker 4:  prologue is out. We have a review of the Honda prologue on the site this

1419
01:21:21,165 --> 01:21:25,085
Speaker 4:  week. It seems like a great car is based on the Chevy Blazer, which had

1420
01:21:25,125 --> 01:21:28,805
Speaker 4:  a stop sale on it. But Honda insists they've done their own software.

1421
01:21:29,445 --> 01:21:33,365
Speaker 4:  So the prologue will not have these problems. But you're really

1422
01:21:33,365 --> 01:21:37,085
Speaker 4:  looking at like a pretty small number of head up competitors to the three

1423
01:21:37,085 --> 01:21:41,005
Speaker 4:  in the Y And there are some Right Polestar exists like the, you

1424
01:21:41,005 --> 01:21:43,965
Speaker 4:  can go down the line, but they're all pretty small scale competitors. They're

1425
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:44,165
Speaker 4:  not like,

1426
01:21:44,395 --> 01:21:47,485
Speaker 5:  When do we get like a Dodge neon dash e

1427
01:21:47,705 --> 01:21:51,165
Speaker 4:  So I Think the Volvo EX 30 will be, it won't be that cheap. Yeah. But it's

1428
01:21:51,165 --> 01:21:54,125
Speaker 4:  a small EV that people seem really hype about. Yeah. So I. I just think like

1429
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:57,365
Speaker 4:  we're in a weird part of the market where the upstart car companies are all

1430
01:21:57,365 --> 01:22:01,205
Speaker 4:  too expensive and then there aren't any, there aren't down here.

1431
01:22:01,215 --> 01:22:02,285
Speaker 4:  There are just like, not a lot of,

1432
01:22:02,315 --> 01:22:06,285
Speaker 5:  It's like the traditional car companies took all the wrong lessons from the

1433
01:22:06,285 --> 01:22:10,205
Speaker 5:  success of Tesla. Yeah. Just like every single lesson, they're like,

1434
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:13,445
Speaker 4:  No, except make this software good. Yeah. They forgot that one.

1435
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:16,485
Speaker 6:  I'll say that down the street from me, there's a Hyundai dealership and over

1436
01:22:16,485 --> 01:22:19,285
Speaker 6:  the last six months, so the dealership is in the middle and then they have

1437
01:22:19,285 --> 01:22:22,845
Speaker 6:  a big parking lot on one side and a big parking lot on the other side. They

1438
01:22:22,845 --> 01:22:26,365
Speaker 6:  ripped up one whole parking lot to put in a bunch of EV chargers. And now

1439
01:22:26,365 --> 01:22:30,245
Speaker 6:  basically the only thing on the lot is Ionic stuff. Oh

1440
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:33,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Actually this you, you the ionic five and the rest of them,

1441
01:22:35,235 --> 01:22:37,205
Speaker 4:  they're the obviously the exception.

1442
01:22:37,595 --> 01:22:40,405
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And well, and now they're doing the same thing to the other side. Yeah.

1443
01:22:40,405 --> 01:22:43,405
Speaker 6:  It's like it's Hyundai Kia is like, they are convinced

1444
01:22:44,115 --> 01:22:45,405
Speaker 6:  they're going to solve this problem.

1445
01:22:45,505 --> 01:22:49,125
Speaker 4:  But you look at where they're playing, they're playing in mainstream segments

1446
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:52,885
Speaker 4:  at mainstream prices. Right. They're, they're not a hundred thousand dollars

1447
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:56,525
Speaker 4:  super trucks. Right. Even the EV nine, which is the big three row SUV

1448
01:22:57,945 --> 01:23:01,165
Speaker 4:  not, it's not a hundred thousand dollars. Like it it is, it is expensive,

1449
01:23:01,585 --> 01:23:05,165
Speaker 4:  but it's not out of the reach of most SUV buyers. Like it's just priced competitively.

1450
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:09,205
Speaker 4:  Right. And that, that feels like the, I feel like I'm saying something very

1451
01:23:09,205 --> 01:23:13,085
Speaker 4:  obvious, like make the most popular kinds of products and price them

1452
01:23:13,085 --> 01:23:14,045
Speaker 4:  competitively. Yeah.

1453
01:23:14,345 --> 01:23:15,765
Speaker 5:  No, that's not the lesson.

1454
01:23:16,205 --> 01:23:18,405
Speaker 4:  A hundred thousand dollars super truck. Got it. There you go.

1455
01:23:20,025 --> 01:23:22,485
Speaker 4:  So we'll see. I just think, I think we're in a really weird moment in the

1456
01:23:22,485 --> 01:23:26,365
Speaker 4:  EV transition. But also if you're in the market for an EV, like not

1457
01:23:26,405 --> 01:23:27,925
Speaker 4:  a horrible time to buy one. Yeah.

1458
01:23:28,645 --> 01:23:29,805
Speaker 6:  Terrible time to buy a hybrid though.

1459
01:23:30,275 --> 01:23:30,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1460
01:23:30,865 --> 01:23:33,525
Speaker 6:  All of a sudden it's impossible to find a hybrid. My dad has been shopping

1461
01:23:33,545 --> 01:23:37,165
Speaker 6:  for a hybrid for a while and everybody wants the new Prius Prime 'cause it's

1462
01:23:37,165 --> 01:23:40,885
Speaker 6:  like finally nice looking and it turns out they're, it's essentially impossible

1463
01:23:40,885 --> 01:23:41,965
Speaker 6:  to get your hands on. It's

1464
01:23:41,965 --> 01:23:45,525
Speaker 4:  Crazy. Yeah. As somebody who owns a plugin hybrid that only gets 25 miles

1465
01:23:45,545 --> 01:23:48,125
Speaker 4:  of range. I'll say that is not enough. You want 50?

1466
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:49,805
Speaker 5:  That's not enough.

1467
01:23:49,865 --> 01:23:53,485
Speaker 4:  If our car had 50, I we we would just keep it forever. Yeah. but

1468
01:23:53,665 --> 01:23:55,485
Speaker 4:  it doesn't. So the second there is one that gets,

1469
01:23:56,145 --> 01:23:57,085
Speaker 5:  I'm all gas man.

1470
01:23:57,675 --> 01:24:00,925
Speaker 4:  Just like I'm all in on gas, here's what I'm doing. I'm pouring oil on myself

1471
01:24:00,925 --> 01:24:01,485
Speaker 4:  every day.

1472
01:24:03,065 --> 01:24:03,645
Speaker 4:  I'm from Texas.

1473
01:24:04,325 --> 01:24:06,565
Speaker 5:  I love Texas. Fracking's awesome.

1474
01:24:06,915 --> 01:24:10,005
Speaker 6:  It's okay. I just ride Lime scooters. So between Alex and me, we're good

1475
01:24:10,005 --> 01:24:10,605
Speaker 6:  to go. Yeah.

1476
01:24:11,025 --> 01:24:11,765
Speaker 5:  We balance out.

1477
01:24:11,865 --> 01:24:15,125
Speaker 4:  All right. There's a bunch of other news here. FUBU was suing Fox and Disney.

1478
01:24:15,285 --> 01:24:16,525
Speaker 4:  I mean, that's just a sentence I said,

1479
01:24:17,145 --> 01:24:18,685
Speaker 5:  But it also was like it was gonna happen.

1480
01:24:19,385 --> 01:24:22,845
Speaker 6:  Can I just say by the way, that the fact that S SPLU has just become the

1481
01:24:22,845 --> 01:24:24,445
Speaker 6:  agreed upon name for this service,

1482
01:24:24,845 --> 01:24:26,125
Speaker 5:  We, we have to stop that. Like

1483
01:24:26,305 --> 01:24:28,285
Speaker 4:  It sports Hulu. I wanna be clear about what people are

1484
01:24:28,285 --> 01:24:31,765
Speaker 6:  Saying. Yeah. Right, right. Sports Hulu and a Alex. Cranz called this first.

1485
01:24:31,945 --> 01:24:33,805
Speaker 6:  So Alex wins. Thank you.

1486
01:24:33,905 --> 01:24:34,325
Speaker 5:  But B,

1487
01:24:34,595 --> 01:24:37,925
Speaker 6:  It's just, everybody just calls it SPLU now, which makes me think it might

1488
01:24:37,925 --> 01:24:41,005
Speaker 6:  be called S splu For real. And we cannot allow that to happen.

1489
01:24:41,065 --> 01:24:43,925
Speaker 5:  People, I know it's gonna be called Sports Max.

1490
01:24:44,545 --> 01:24:48,525
Speaker 4:  It should just be called ESPN. Yes. It's, it will be ridiculous

1491
01:24:48,585 --> 01:24:49,685
Speaker 4:  if they don't call it espn.

1492
01:24:49,725 --> 01:24:52,765
Speaker 5:  ESPN Max sponsored by Hulu

1493
01:24:54,915 --> 01:24:58,325
Speaker 4:  With Fox. If they start a giant sports streaming service and they don't just

1494
01:24:58,325 --> 01:25:02,205
Speaker 4:  call it ESPN, they will have made such a gigantic error.

1495
01:25:03,115 --> 01:25:06,645
Speaker 4:  Like you are looking at one of the most legendary brands

1496
01:25:06,905 --> 01:25:10,765
Speaker 4:  in watching sports that has ever existed. And it's like

1497
01:25:10,765 --> 01:25:14,205
Speaker 4:  the people at Fox Sports will be like, well you can't, it's gotta, it's gotta

1498
01:25:14,725 --> 01:25:17,845
Speaker 4:  indicate that it's Fox Sports as well. And it's like, no it doesn't. You

1499
01:25:17,845 --> 01:25:18,565
Speaker 4:  can just have a tile.

1500
01:25:20,005 --> 01:25:23,245
Speaker 6:  Somebody posted the other day a screenshot of like a promotional thing for

1501
01:25:23,245 --> 01:25:26,605
Speaker 6:  them to sign up for a streaming service. And it was Hulu with live TV

1502
01:25:26,995 --> 01:25:30,525
Speaker 6:  with Paramount Plus with Showtime. It is. That was the official name.

1503
01:25:31,155 --> 01:25:32,285
Speaker 5:  It's so good. It's like,

1504
01:25:32,285 --> 01:25:33,125
Speaker 6:  What have we done here?

1505
01:25:33,635 --> 01:25:36,805
Speaker 4:  It's all very bad. All right, we gotta wrap this up. We've gone way over.

1506
01:25:37,885 --> 01:25:41,845
Speaker 4:  I wanna call it two stories. One, we have a a look back, it

1507
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:44,965
Speaker 4:  Spiked Jones, her the movie Her, which is all about falling in love with

1508
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:47,525
Speaker 4:  ai. It's very good. You should go read the look back, you should watch the

1509
01:25:47,525 --> 01:25:51,485
Speaker 4:  movie. It still holds up. And then we sent a reporter to

1510
01:25:51,515 --> 01:25:55,245
Speaker 4:  King of the Hammers. There's a big silly off-Road race. It's Burning Man

1511
01:25:55,245 --> 01:25:56,085
Speaker 4:  for off-Road vehicles.

1512
01:25:57,745 --> 01:26:01,405
Speaker 4:  She got to ride in the Ford Switchgear. The

1513
01:26:01,745 --> 01:26:05,005
Speaker 4:  EV F1, the EV F-150 off roadie thing.

1514
01:26:05,955 --> 01:26:08,605
Speaker 4:  This is what I wanna trade my after and four So. I'm very excited about the

1515
01:26:08,605 --> 01:26:11,405
Speaker 4:  story. And also there's pictures of a cyber truck trying off road, one of

1516
01:26:11,405 --> 01:26:15,245
Speaker 4:  which broke itself. So it rules that piece will link to the thing. And

1517
01:26:15,245 --> 01:26:18,845
Speaker 4:  then it's big news. We get stopped by Southwest doing the show live
