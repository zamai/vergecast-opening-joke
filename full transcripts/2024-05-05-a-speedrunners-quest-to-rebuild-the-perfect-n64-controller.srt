00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:36,125
Speaker 1:  For listening to this podcast,

3
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:44,365
Speaker 3:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Mushy Bowls, I'm your

4
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:48,125
Speaker 3:  friend David Pierce and this is the first in a new series of

5
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:52,005
Speaker 3:  episodes sponsored by Visible Wireless all about gaming. For the

6
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:55,965
Speaker 3:  next four Sundays we are going to tell you about all kinds of different stories

7
00:00:56,265 --> 00:01:00,245
Speaker 3:  in gaming. We did a series last fall, we had a ton of fun. We're doing it

8
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:02,645
Speaker 3:  again but this time we're doing it slightly differently. We're gonna tell

9
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:06,325
Speaker 3:  you stories about the five senses of the gaming world and if you're saying

10
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:09,445
Speaker 3:  David, there are five senses and you just said four Sundays, that's true.

11
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:12,565
Speaker 3:  You're gonna have to stick around to see how we figure it out. Our friends

12
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:16,405
Speaker 3:  from Polygon are gonna join us to help explain. We have some really fun

13
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:20,645
Speaker 3:  wild stories about how the Five Senses show up all over the

14
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:24,605
Speaker 3:  video game world. The first one we're doing is all about touch and our touch

15
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:28,285
Speaker 3:  story comes from a very specific corner of the gaming world. Speed running.

16
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:32,365
Speaker 3:  These are those like incredibly dedicated gamers who just try to beat

17
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,325
Speaker 3:  games in as little time as possible. They play it over and over faster

18
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:40,125
Speaker 3:  and faster, always trying to get time down, either by exploiting

19
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:43,645
Speaker 3:  glitches and shortcuts in the game or just spending hours and hours and hours

20
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,565
Speaker 3:  finding the exact optimal path through a game. If you've

21
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:51,085
Speaker 3:  never watched a speed run, pick your favorite game and just poke around on

22
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:54,965
Speaker 3:  YouTube, you'll probably find someone playing it in ways that you seriously

23
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:58,365
Speaker 3:  didn't think were possible and people who are really good at speed running

24
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:01,725
Speaker 3:  can often do it blindfolded, which is just a whole other thing that I don't

25
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:05,285
Speaker 3:  even understand. Our producer will pour poked around the Nintendo

26
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:09,205
Speaker 3:  64 speedrunning community and he discovered that all is not well there

27
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:13,445
Speaker 3:  and is very not well for one speedrunner in particular. I'll

28
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:14,205
Speaker 3:  let will take it from here.

29
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,965
Speaker 5:  I am a big fan of Nintendo 64 and so I was delighted

30
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:26,485
Speaker 5:  to discover just how popular my favorite games are for Speed Runners.

31
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:30,925
Speaker 5:  I've been watching these incredible videos of people flying through

32
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:34,805
Speaker 5:  Mario 64, Zelda, Mario Kart, finding

33
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,805
Speaker 5:  all these shortcuts and hacks that I had no idea about when I was

34
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:42,765
Speaker 5:  playing these games back in the day. But the more I learned about the

35
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:46,765
Speaker 5:  N 64 community, the more I heard about this problem that they've been

36
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:50,725
Speaker 5:  dealing with for years. I found this really dramatic YouTube

37
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:52,045
Speaker 5:  video that lays it all out.

38
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:56,005
Speaker 6:  Back in 2003, the Nintendo 64 was

39
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:58,885
Speaker 6:  discontinued never to be manufactured again.

40
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:05,045
Speaker 6:  But what nobody understood at the time is that Nintendo had just set

41
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:08,725
Speaker 6:  off a ticking time bomb. Something that years

42
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:12,365
Speaker 6:  later would threaten the entire existence of speed running on the N

43
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:12,925
Speaker 6:  64.

44
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:17,845
Speaker 5:  The issue is when you play lots of these games competitively, you

45
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:21,685
Speaker 5:  end up beating the crap outta your controller. You're playing for hours

46
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:25,605
Speaker 5:  every day and you're going really hard. So you're wearing down a

47
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:29,365
Speaker 5:  bunch of little plastic parts that were just never built for it in an N

48
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:32,285
Speaker 5:  64 controller. It's the joysticks that eventually give out.

49
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:37,285
Speaker 5:  I actually remember this happening. My brothers and I used to fight over

50
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:40,725
Speaker 5:  which controller we got to use 'cause the joystick on one of them just kind

51
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:44,445
Speaker 5:  of flopped around. So it's a super common thing, but if

52
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:48,285
Speaker 5:  you're a speedrunner, a bad controller can cost you a lot of

53
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:52,205
Speaker 5:  time and precision. So everyone wants nice pristine hardware to

54
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:55,925
Speaker 5:  play with. The problem is Nintendo hasn't

55
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:59,365
Speaker 5:  made original N 64 controllers for 20 years

56
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:03,845
Speaker 5:  and all that time speed runners have been burning through joysticks at

57
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:07,245
Speaker 5:  a fast enough clip that the world is running out of them.

58
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:11,045
Speaker 6:  So under this major threat of having to go outside

59
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:15,725
Speaker 6:  speed runners have been waging a desperate war trying to

60
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:18,005
Speaker 6:  halt this problem before time runs out.

61
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:22,605
Speaker 5:  N 64 controllers are now real commodities on

62
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:26,565
Speaker 5:  eBay. An unopened genuine Nintendo controller can go for

63
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:30,485
Speaker 5:  more than $500. There are third party controllers out there but

64
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:34,325
Speaker 5:  they're just not as good. So lots of speed runners end up

65
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:38,045
Speaker 5:  playing what they call the eBay lottery. They buy a used

66
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:41,925
Speaker 5:  Nintendo made controller and just hope the joystick is okay

67
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:46,525
Speaker 8:  And this looks in pretty good shape. Sticks stick is actually pretty

68
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:50,445
Speaker 8:  tight. Stick on this one is also, it's a little loose but it's not

69
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:50,845
Speaker 8:  too bad.

70
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:55,645
Speaker 5:  There's even a cottage industry of people building new joystick parts.

71
00:04:56,235 --> 00:05:00,165
Speaker 5:  Some are 3D printed, really nice ones are made of steel, but

72
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:03,725
Speaker 5:  those go in and outta stock. There's a secondary market. It's a whole thing.

73
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:08,085
Speaker 5:  Anyway, the story that I'm here to tell, it's set in the

74
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:11,805
Speaker 5:  world of that controller shortage but it's not that story.

75
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:16,125
Speaker 5:  It's about this one very accomplished. Mario Kart 64

76
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:20,005
Speaker 5:  speedrunner who has a very different, much lonelier

77
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:20,245
Speaker 5:  problem.

78
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:25,125
Speaker 5:  Just to start off, how'd you get into speed running and when

79
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:29,725
Speaker 9:  I started playing Mario Kart 64 in

80
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:33,445
Speaker 9:  I guess like late 2013, I had owned

81
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:37,525
Speaker 9:  the game when it originally came out, but it probably never touched it again

82
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:41,485
Speaker 9:  after the Game Cube came out. But I just randomly had the N

83
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:44,965
Speaker 9:  64 round one day and was just messing around with

84
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:46,765
Speaker 9:  Mario Kart on it.

85
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:54,445
Speaker 5:  This is the humble beginning of Beck Abney or Abney

86
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:58,165
Speaker 5:  3 1 7 online today he's a a 30-year-old software

87
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:01,925
Speaker 5:  engineer and Mario Kar legend. But back in 2013

88
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:05,165
Speaker 5:  he was just a guy dusting off an old game system for fun.

89
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:09,845
Speaker 9:  Then I think I was looking up how to do mini turbos or something online and

90
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:13,645
Speaker 9:  accidentally found the, the time trial rankings and thought, oh hey this

91
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:16,445
Speaker 9:  looks fun. I'll, I'll just submit some times.

92
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:20,965
Speaker 5:  The psych he found was Mario kart 60 four.com home of

93
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:24,725
Speaker 5:  that game's speedrunning community. Basically a group of gamers

94
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:28,605
Speaker 5:  dedicated to completing each of the game 16 courses in as

95
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:32,365
Speaker 5:  little time as possible. Mario Kart 64 was released back in

96
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:36,525
Speaker 5:  1996, so by the time Beck wandered in, they'd been at

97
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:38,005
Speaker 5:  it for more than 15 years.

98
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:42,645
Speaker 9:  The website has times from people who submitted, you know, right when

99
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:46,565
Speaker 9:  the game came out. So the community has existed for a really long time and

100
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:50,485
Speaker 9:  when I joined and long after I joined, it was just kind of you

101
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:54,245
Speaker 9:  send an email in with whatever your times are, you know,

102
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:58,125
Speaker 9:  you may or may not provide proof, you know, before I joined people were

103
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,205
Speaker 9:  mailing in VHS tapes and things like that

104
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:03,645
Speaker 5:  And Beck thought I can get into this.

105
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:07,325
Speaker 9:  I'll drive some times today and see, see where it ends up. I think I was

106
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:11,525
Speaker 9:  maybe 350th or 360 somewhere in the

107
00:07:11,545 --> 00:07:15,365
Speaker 9:  mid three hundreds when I first joined, which today would be

108
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:19,205
Speaker 9:  maybe equivalent to 500 something 'cause

109
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:23,165
Speaker 9:  we've had so many more people join in the last 10 years. Now, 10 years

110
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,605
Speaker 9:  later I'm still still playing.

111
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:28,765
Speaker 5:  He didn't stay in the mid three hundreds for long though. He started playing

112
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:32,645
Speaker 5:  for hours a day or grinding as speed runners would call it

113
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,925
Speaker 5:  and it was showing. So what put you on the map in

114
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:39,005
Speaker 5:  speed running? What were your first records?

115
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:43,325
Speaker 9:  When I first was playing, I went up the ranks really

116
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:47,365
Speaker 9:  quickly so I was really high ranked in non shortcut

117
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:51,285
Speaker 9:  and shortcut. A lot of people don't really play both a

118
00:07:51,365 --> 00:07:54,965
Speaker 9:  ton, usually one's more focused on the other, but I was kind of doing

119
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:55,445
Speaker 9:  everything.

120
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:02,485
Speaker 5:  So some context here, it's pretty easy to cheat in Mario Kart

121
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:06,485
Speaker 5:  on some tracks. You can hop over guardrails and land way further ahead

122
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:10,645
Speaker 5:  in the course in other spots you can glitch the game out by crashing

123
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:14,645
Speaker 5:  into just the right out of bounds wall and you get warped to the finish

124
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:18,485
Speaker 5:  line. Over the years discovering new shortcuts has become a

125
00:08:18,485 --> 00:08:22,445
Speaker 5:  sport unto itself. So today the community divides records

126
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:26,525
Speaker 5:  up into these two buckets, runs that use shortcuts and runs

127
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:30,365
Speaker 5:  that don't. Anyway, Beck was making waves in both

128
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:34,005
Speaker 5:  categories but he really made a name for himself in shortcuts.

129
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:38,205
Speaker 9:  My first record eventually was the new Chaco Mountain

130
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:41,205
Speaker 9:  shortcut was discovered in 2014.

131
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:52,525
Speaker 5:  It's a pretty absurd hack. You launch yourself straight at a wall right

132
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:56,125
Speaker 5:  at the start of the race and then fall backwards across the finish line,

133
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,365
Speaker 5:  but somehow the game thinks you've driven a full lap.

134
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:04,005
Speaker 9:  I was the first person to hit it about six months after it was

135
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:08,165
Speaker 9:  discovered to get like a five second lap. It was just kind of automatic world

136
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:10,885
Speaker 9:  record just for hitting it. It was like a ten second world record improvement

137
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:15,045
Speaker 9:  and then I would improve the the three lap record a few months

138
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:17,445
Speaker 9:  later as well and that record kept going down

139
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:21,325
Speaker 5:  Again. Being competitive in any game means grinding,

140
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:25,725
Speaker 5:  playing for hours and hours and hours. Shaving off a

141
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:29,645
Speaker 5:  second here a second there. I've watched Beck play, he live streams

142
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:32,565
Speaker 5:  on Twitch and it is oddly mesmerizing.

143
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:33,605
Speaker 10:  Hello

144
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:38,125
Speaker 10:  race again.

145
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:43,045
Speaker 5:  Lots of speed. Runners go pretty big in their streams, especially when they

146
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:43,445
Speaker 5:  hit records.

147
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:44,685
Speaker 11:  Bouncer police.

148
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,245
Speaker 12:  Yeah. Hey let's go.

149
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:50,645
Speaker 12:  Whoa

150
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:55,685
Speaker 5:  Dad. By comparison, Beck is pretty understated. Here he

151
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:59,005
Speaker 5:  is hitting that Chaco Mountain shortcut on all three laps,

152
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:03,165
Speaker 5:  which meant finishing the whole race in less than 18 seconds. Yeah,

153
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:06,245
Speaker 5:  the non shortcut record for reference is a minute 55.

154
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:07,565
Speaker 11:  Oh my god.

155
00:10:11,665 --> 00:10:14,885
Speaker 5:  He just smiles, shakes his head and chuckles to himself

156
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,205
Speaker 13:  And he's a pretty Ute run.

157
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:23,445
Speaker 5:  Shortcuts are really weird to watch because the glitches are often very

158
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:27,005
Speaker 5:  hard to trigger. So it's a lot of trying, failing,

159
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:31,845
Speaker 5:  resetting and trying again and again. But there's something about

160
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,885
Speaker 5:  Beck that is clearly tuned to that kind of zen state and

161
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,485
Speaker 5:  it's worked for him. So long sessions, lots of attempts.

162
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:43,765
Speaker 5:  What is your rising through the ranks here? What is your end goal?

163
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,445
Speaker 5:  What? What do you have your sights on?

164
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:49,885
Speaker 9:  I just kept trying to improve. There's a lot of good goals in this game that

165
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:53,485
Speaker 9:  they have that kind of keep people playing a lot. I think I got up to number

166
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:57,405
Speaker 9:  two in non shortcut and eventually I was

167
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:01,565
Speaker 9:  grinding to become shortcut champ and I became number one in the

168
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:02,645
Speaker 9:  shortcut category.

169
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:07,125
Speaker 5:  His specialty was playing through all 16 courses using all

170
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,805
Speaker 5:  the known shortcuts. He was so dominant that a YouTuber named

171
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:14,725
Speaker 5:  Summoning Salt made an hour long video just about the quest to beat

172
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:14,925
Speaker 5:  him

173
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:19,245
Speaker 11:  And then there's Abney making a joke of the

174
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:23,165
Speaker 11:  competition. Nobody could catch up to him without new

175
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:23,805
Speaker 11:  strategies

176
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:28,565
Speaker 5:  But the competition was heating up 20 years after the release of

177
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:32,405
Speaker 5:  Mario Kart 64, the game was more popular than ever to speed

178
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,885
Speaker 5:  run Beck fell back to third place in non shortcut driving,

179
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:38,925
Speaker 5:  but he fought to stay competitive and he kept improving.

180
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:43,605
Speaker 9:  I was better at driving in 2019 than I was in 2016

181
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:47,365
Speaker 9:  even though I dropped back to third place 'cause I was playing

182
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:51,685
Speaker 9:  shortcut and I was doing the full game runs and streaming a lot and playing

183
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:55,645
Speaker 9:  a lot of different categories. It I definitely improved until, you know,

184
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:59,125
Speaker 9:  2019 and then I had a lot of controller issues

185
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:03,725
Speaker 5:  In 2019. Everything changed for Beck and not for the

186
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:07,565
Speaker 5:  better. That's the year the N 64 controller crisis caught up

187
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:11,445
Speaker 5:  with him. The joystick failures, the parts shortage, all

188
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:15,125
Speaker 5:  of it, but in a way that no one could have anticipated.

189
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:16,805
Speaker 5:  That's after the break.

193
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:44,135
Speaker 5:  Welcome back to recap. The year is 2019.

194
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:48,855
Speaker 5:  Beck Abney is a Mario Kart speed running phenomenon but the

195
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:52,375
Speaker 5:  more he plays, the more he notices that something is off.

196
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:57,015
Speaker 5:  How did you find yourself in your own very lonely predicament

197
00:13:57,015 --> 00:13:57,975
Speaker 5:  around controllers?

198
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:01,935
Speaker 9:  You know, that day when I just randomly decided to start playing it, we had

199
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:05,815
Speaker 9:  three controllers and I just was picked them all

200
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:10,055
Speaker 9:  and my old gray controller happened to be in the best condition.

201
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:13,855
Speaker 9:  I was like, oh this one's good, I'll just use this one. And I just kept using

202
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:17,495
Speaker 9:  that same controller for the next couple years and

203
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:21,575
Speaker 9:  as it slowly wore down, I never really noticed it.

204
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:25,495
Speaker 9:  I just kind of got used to it and I kept improving my times

205
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:29,815
Speaker 9:  so I didn't think much of it. I kept improving and the controller just

206
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:33,695
Speaker 9:  kept getting more and more destroyed from me playing Mario Kart and then

207
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:37,495
Speaker 9:  eventually that controller got worn down so much that I couldn't

208
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:39,255
Speaker 9:  turn properly with it anymore.

209
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:42,855
Speaker 7:  Here we go.

210
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:47,375
Speaker 5:  If speed running in general is stressful for controllers, Mario

211
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:51,500
Speaker 5:  Kart is torture. You're constantly wrenching the joystick back

212
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,365
Speaker 5:  and forth to get these little speed boosts and if you're really grinding

213
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,365
Speaker 5:  a new controller can flake out in a matter of weeks.

214
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:03,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So what is the, what are the parts that are degrading and failing?

215
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:07,565
Speaker 9:  Yeah, there's like a little bowl on the inside that

216
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:11,165
Speaker 9:  kind of pushes up against the bottom of the analog stick

217
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:15,605
Speaker 9:  and it sort of is just like a little curved plastic bowl and the

218
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:19,485
Speaker 9:  analog stick just will dig into this plastic. It's just

219
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,085
Speaker 9:  plastic on plastic and If. you open up one of these controllers

220
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:27,165
Speaker 9:  that's like old and used, it will just be full of plastic

221
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:31,125
Speaker 9:  dust from the bowl being just shaved down.

222
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:35,565
Speaker 5:  There are ways to extend the life of these parts. Some speed

223
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,565
Speaker 5:  runners open up their controllers and lubricate all the places where plastic

224
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:43,725
Speaker 5:  grinds on plastic, but eventually those little sticks and bowls will

225
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:46,965
Speaker 5:  be toast. This is the crux of the joystick shortage

226
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:50,765
Speaker 5:  and it was the backdrop as Beck went looking for a new controller,

227
00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:54,845
Speaker 9:  I was like, okay, I need a different controller now I guess. And then when

228
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:58,245
Speaker 9:  I tried to, you know, use a perfect condition one I bought a bunch on eBay,

229
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:01,725
Speaker 9:  they were a little bit easier to find back then I was like, oh I, I can't

230
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:03,445
Speaker 9:  drive very well with with this one.

231
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:07,805
Speaker 5:  The problem bizarrely was that the new controller was

232
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:11,605
Speaker 5:  too nice. He'd gotten really good at playing with a half

233
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:15,485
Speaker 5:  broken controller. What is the best language that you

234
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:18,805
Speaker 5:  have to describe what it is you're feeling for

235
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,925
Speaker 5:  with the con the the perfect controller

236
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:25,085
Speaker 9:  In the past I've described it as, and if people have used a lot of N

237
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:29,005
Speaker 9:  64 controllers or bad ones will kind of know what I mean is

238
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:32,925
Speaker 9:  like it's mushy. Like the analog stick as

239
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,445
Speaker 9:  you're pushing it like a, a perfect one will feel like the same

240
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,125
Speaker 9:  when you're pushing it, you know, halfway versus all the way like it feels

241
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:44,005
Speaker 9:  like one fluid motion where like the I guess

242
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:48,245
Speaker 9:  ones that I'm using will be kind of harder to push as you

243
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:51,845
Speaker 9:  get closer to the edge. It like stops me before I even get there really?

244
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:55,085
Speaker 9:  But it's like kind of a weird squishy feeling for it.

245
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,485
Speaker 5:  Beck opened up his old controller and he saw that, yep, the little plastic

246
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:03,525
Speaker 5:  bowl was worn down. He realized that that was the source of the mus.

247
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:07,765
Speaker 5:  So as a test he put that old part into a new controller

248
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:12,165
Speaker 5:  and it worked. He had a new controller that felt like an old

249
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:16,165
Speaker 5:  mushy one. So for a while Abni 3 1 7 was back.

250
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,805
Speaker 5:  But then that controller failed

251
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:23,205
Speaker 9:  And that same process happened maybe two or three more times where

252
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:27,005
Speaker 9:  I kind of was like, oh well I know the solution now I'll just, I just have

253
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,845
Speaker 9:  to swap out everything except the bowl. Keep the super worn down bowl

254
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:34,365
Speaker 9:  and swap out all the other parts. And I was doing that and I was getting

255
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:35,645
Speaker 9:  world records at that point too.

256
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:41,765
Speaker 5:  The intensity was ramping up. He was driving faster,

257
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:45,685
Speaker 5:  grinding harder and destroying his controllers along the way.

258
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:49,885
Speaker 9:  I remember specifically getting a rainbow road non

259
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:54,125
Speaker 9:  shortcut world record. My controller broke and literally the, the

260
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:57,805
Speaker 9:  analog stick actually snapped in half off the

261
00:17:57,805 --> 00:17:58,365
Speaker 9:  controller.

262
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:03,285
Speaker 5:  Beck and his squishy bowl were riding high but it was never

263
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:04,325
Speaker 5:  going to last forever

264
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:08,765
Speaker 9:  And then eventually it was worn down too much.

265
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:13,245
Speaker 5:  He put the old bowl and yet another new controller but it was

266
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:13,925
Speaker 5:  too far gone.

267
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:15,965
Speaker 9:  There's no going back. At that point

268
00:18:16,465 --> 00:18:20,325
Speaker 5:  The perfect controller was well and truly dead and it was

269
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:24,165
Speaker 5:  the worst possible time for this kind of setback. Beck felt like he was

270
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:28,165
Speaker 5:  this close to being at the top of his game, which would be the

271
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:31,925
Speaker 5:  top of pretty much anyone's game. But now he was being held

272
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:32,205
Speaker 5:  back.

273
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:36,445
Speaker 9:  It got to the point where I was reaching closer and closer kind of to my

274
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,245
Speaker 9:  top potential of driving maybe. And I was more and more

275
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:43,805
Speaker 9:  picky over time and every time I'd have to swap controllers I'd be like,

276
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:47,365
Speaker 9:  oh well this one's not quite as good as the one I was just using.

277
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:51,605
Speaker 5:  So it feels like you are like with your own sort of

278
00:18:51,685 --> 00:18:55,205
Speaker 5:  aptitude for the game hitting a ceiling where

279
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,765
Speaker 5:  whatever tiny difference the controller makes yeah. Is for you. The difference

280
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,645
Speaker 5:  between improving or not improving.

281
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:05,845
Speaker 9:  It's like I might be able to improve in the game more but I'm not able

282
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,165
Speaker 9:  to even get to where I was

283
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:16,085
Speaker 5:  But Beck wasn't finished. If there was one thing he knew how to do,

284
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:36,105
Speaker 5:  Welcome back. So Beck Abney was in a bind.

285
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:40,425
Speaker 5:  His ideal controller no longer existed and competitors

286
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:44,305
Speaker 5:  were eating away at his hard won records at this point his

287
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:47,625
Speaker 5:  options were one throw in the towel, two

288
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:51,785
Speaker 5:  spend years retraining himself on a good controller or

289
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:55,425
Speaker 5:  three somehow reverse engineer his old messed up

290
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:59,305
Speaker 5:  joystick. For Beck there was only one way forward. So

291
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:02,825
Speaker 5:  talk to me about what hoops you have jumped through to try to

292
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:06,025
Speaker 5:  recreate this mythical controller.

293
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:10,065
Speaker 9:  I mean originally it was like let me just buy a hundred controllers on eBay

294
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:13,825
Speaker 9:  and just go crazy and see if I get lucky. So I literally just have like

295
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:17,985
Speaker 9:  an absurd amount of controllers and it's possible I could mix and

296
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,865
Speaker 9:  match something and it actually would work. I never really had any luck with

297
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:22,025
Speaker 9:  that.

298
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:26,665
Speaker 5:  So next Beck tried designing custom parts that

299
00:21:26,665 --> 00:21:30,545
Speaker 5:  mimicked his old controller. He used a 3D printing service to build

300
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:30,745
Speaker 5:  them

301
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:35,185
Speaker 9:  Shout outs to Yasmin in my discord who has, who had modeled some of

302
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:39,145
Speaker 9:  these for me. Took some existing 3D models that other people

303
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:43,065
Speaker 9:  had made and basically artificially like shaved down the bowl

304
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:47,425
Speaker 9:  to make it kind of worn down as if someone had actually

305
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:51,145
Speaker 9:  used it a bunch. But I'm just 3D printing it, you know, out of the box

306
00:21:51,255 --> 00:21:53,385
Speaker 9:  just in bad condition. On purpose

307
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:57,985
Speaker 5:  For the record modifying controllers is allowed in Mario Kart speed running.

308
00:21:58,365 --> 00:22:00,745
Speaker 5:  You just can't add new functionality to it.

309
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,945
Speaker 9:  We did like a ton of different ones. So like 0.1 millimeters cut out

310
00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:08,705
Speaker 9:  0.2 and then like all the way to like 1.5 millimeters

311
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:13,025
Speaker 9:  carved out and I 3D printed 'em all and I tested 'em all and one or

312
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:15,105
Speaker 9:  two of them I was like, oh this is kind of close.

313
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:19,345
Speaker 5:  It felt familiar. Yeah, with that encouragement he started

314
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:22,785
Speaker 5:  iterating on other parts like the joystick and the springs,

315
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:26,825
Speaker 9:  Now let's print it in a bunch of different materials. Maybe the different

316
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:30,905
Speaker 9:  materials will feel different and they do very different.

317
00:22:31,345 --> 00:22:31,465
Speaker 9:  Actually

318
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:35,185
Speaker 5:  Beck showed me this spreadsheet he's been using to keep track of all the

319
00:22:35,225 --> 00:22:39,185
Speaker 5:  permutations to date he's tested 33 distinct

320
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:42,905
Speaker 5:  combinations of bowl and stick and springs. He's got

321
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:47,065
Speaker 5:  comments on all of them. Most are some variation on me but

322
00:22:47,185 --> 00:22:50,305
Speaker 5:  a couple feel promising. He even set a world record with one of them.

323
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:54,345
Speaker 9:  It's basically just guess and check. Just kind of spend a bunch of money,

324
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:58,385
Speaker 9:  three printing random iterations and hope something

325
00:22:58,495 --> 00:23:00,225
Speaker 9:  magically works for me.

326
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:04,865
Speaker 5:  Is this as frustrating as it sounds as you're telling me this, it

327
00:23:04,865 --> 00:23:06,105
Speaker 5:  sounds incredibly frustrating.

328
00:23:06,295 --> 00:23:10,025
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it's pretty annoying. I mean I'm lucky that I have like a fairly

329
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:13,505
Speaker 9:  popular stream and other stuff I can play and it's still

330
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:17,385
Speaker 9:  still fun but unfortunately, I guess 'cause it's like I

331
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:20,705
Speaker 9:  probably could have competed more. I think there were records that I was

332
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:24,585
Speaker 9:  close to getting that I didn't have. I was at one point really close

333
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:28,345
Speaker 9:  on like the Luigi Raceway three lap non shortcut record

334
00:23:28,685 --> 00:23:32,425
Speaker 9:  and then I had controller problems and, and they kind of ran

335
00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:36,385
Speaker 9:  away far ahead of me after that and it, it's like I have no idea if I

336
00:23:36,385 --> 00:23:40,185
Speaker 9:  would be able to drive the time, like their times are way beyond

337
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:44,105
Speaker 9:  what I was doing five years ago. So I have no idea if I could get there now.

338
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:48,365
Speaker 5:  Do you, you feel the irony of of everyone else hunting for pristine

339
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:51,925
Speaker 5:  joysticks while you are hunting for Yeah. These half broken ones

340
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:52,445
Speaker 5:  Kind

341
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:56,045
Speaker 9:  Of, yeah. Yeah. It's funny 'cause I, yeah and I have some of those like steel

342
00:23:56,055 --> 00:23:59,525
Speaker 9:  stick controllers and stuff that people want. I use them for some

343
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:03,845
Speaker 9:  shortcut stuff, but yeah, it's like hard for me to create

344
00:24:04,065 --> 00:24:07,605
Speaker 9:  my perfect garbage controller that I want

345
00:24:08,285 --> 00:24:11,845
Speaker 9:  and I, I don't have that controller. I can't like 3D scan

346
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:14,325
Speaker 9:  the parts and just replicate 'em or something.

347
00:24:15,145 --> 00:24:18,805
Speaker 5:  The really galling part is that some other players prefer crappy

348
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:23,045
Speaker 5:  controllers too. One of his biggest rivals does, but Beck

349
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:26,925
Speaker 5:  says that somehow it's easier for them to get used to new

350
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:27,165
Speaker 5:  parts.

351
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:30,885
Speaker 9:  He'll be like, oh I can't use this one anymore. And he'll do like a whole

352
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:34,485
Speaker 9:  controller testing stream just testing other stuff and they'll be like, oh

353
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:35,325
Speaker 9:  this one's fine now.

354
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:39,565
Speaker 5:  Whereas try as he might beck just can't seem to

355
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:43,445
Speaker 5:  warm up to anything else. It's such a bummer that as

356
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:46,765
Speaker 5:  we talked, I started trying to work the problem myself.

357
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:51,365
Speaker 5:  Like what If you tr Okay, have you tried getting controllers

358
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:54,205
Speaker 5:  from other Mario Kart 64 players

359
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:58,685
Speaker 9:  And that was the, the genius idea was to take the

360
00:24:58,685 --> 00:25:02,245
Speaker 9:  person who likes the perfect controller. Now they, they're done with it,

361
00:25:02,275 --> 00:25:06,085
Speaker 9:  pass it on to the person who likes the, the slightly worse controller

362
00:25:06,265 --> 00:25:09,205
Speaker 9:  and have like the big chain of people passing down controllers.

363
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:09,765
Speaker 5:  Oh my god,

364
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:13,765
Speaker 9:  That was a thought. I have had people send me controllers

365
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:17,645
Speaker 9:  before and someone sent me one who was like pretty,

366
00:25:17,645 --> 00:25:21,085
Speaker 9:  pretty high ranked and plays a lot. They sent me one, it was like,

367
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:25,165
Speaker 9:  it was kind of mushy like I had described, but it like wasn't

368
00:25:25,215 --> 00:25:29,125
Speaker 9:  quite right and it's also, I admittedly probably

369
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:32,645
Speaker 9:  play the game like way more so I would be waiting on their

370
00:25:33,005 --> 00:25:36,845
Speaker 9:  controllers if they, you know, I'm like, hurry up and wear down your so

371
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:38,725
Speaker 9:  I can, I could play again kind of thing.

372
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:51,725
Speaker 5:  So for now, that's where things stand. Beck has another batch

373
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:55,485
Speaker 5:  of 3D printed parts arriving in the mail soon he'll try those

374
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:59,445
Speaker 5:  out and see if he gets lucky. In the meantime, he's working on a few

375
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:03,165
Speaker 5:  shortcut records on individual courses. One of his Franken

376
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:07,365
Speaker 5:  controllers works okay for that kind of race. So you're still, you're still

377
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,925
Speaker 5:  committed. Yeah. You're still, for

378
00:26:08,925 --> 00:26:09,445
Speaker 9:  Now at least,

379
00:26:09,585 --> 00:26:12,005
Speaker 5:  You're still here to defend your Honor. Yeah.

380
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:14,725
Speaker 9:  Haven't completely given up 'cause of the controllers yet.

381
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:18,525
Speaker 5:  Gotcha. Is do you, do you have your dark moments where you're like, this

382
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:19,165
Speaker 5:  is not worth it?

383
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:23,445
Speaker 9:  Yeah, yeah. If I didn't have like my stream and a lot

384
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:26,685
Speaker 9:  of people watching and stuff, I probably just like wouldn't even play honestly.

385
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:30,805
Speaker 9:  I just, I, I would maybe do shortcut time trials to just keep

386
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:34,845
Speaker 9:  my number one rank there, but it's just

387
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:37,925
Speaker 9:  like honestly a lot more trouble than it's worth a lot of the time. Like

388
00:26:38,525 --> 00:26:42,125
Speaker 9:  spending all the money trying to print random stuff for none of it to work

389
00:26:42,305 --> 00:26:46,165
Speaker 9:  is just a a lot. But to the being

390
00:26:46,165 --> 00:26:49,845
Speaker 9:  able to have something fun to stream or whatever at least keeps me motivated

391
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:51,485
Speaker 9:  to some degree. I would at least

392
00:26:51,995 --> 00:26:55,925
Speaker 5:  Accepting your current situation and what you've got to work with.

393
00:26:56,275 --> 00:26:57,365
Speaker 5:  What do you have your sights on now?

394
00:26:58,185 --> 00:27:01,725
Speaker 9:  The last few days I've been playing Yoshi Valley shortcut

395
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:03,605
Speaker 9:  three lap in Time trials.

396
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:12,605
Speaker 5:  Yoshi Valley is another one of those runs with a really weird glitch.

397
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:17,005
Speaker 5:  You start the race and immediately veer off the course, leap over a fence

398
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:20,565
Speaker 5:  and go flying into a canyon. Perfecting that

399
00:27:20,885 --> 00:27:24,685
Speaker 5:  shortcut means grinding out a super precise set of button presses

400
00:27:24,865 --> 00:27:28,725
Speaker 5:  for hours on end, joystick to the left, brake plus

401
00:27:28,825 --> 00:27:32,805
Speaker 5:  gas to turn, accelerate leap and sail into

402
00:27:32,805 --> 00:27:33,325
Speaker 5:  oblivion

403
00:27:34,115 --> 00:27:37,765
Speaker 9:  Just launching off the side of the track and slamming into a wall

404
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:38,805
Speaker 9:  over and over,

405
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:43,485
Speaker 5:  Which happens to be a pretty good metaphor for Beck's situation right now.

406
00:27:44,275 --> 00:27:47,645
Speaker 5:  He's doggedly testing new parts and new combinations

407
00:27:48,195 --> 00:27:51,685
Speaker 5:  attempt after attempt to rebuild the perfect controller,

408
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:56,285
Speaker 5:  but more often than not he hits a wall the same wall

409
00:27:56,835 --> 00:27:58,925
Speaker 5:  over and over and over again.

410
00:28:05,745 --> 00:28:09,365
Speaker 3:  All right, thank you Will. That is it for The Vergecast. Today I am going

411
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:12,965
Speaker 3:  to go hug my N 64 controller tighter than ever. Thank you as always

412
00:28:13,145 --> 00:28:17,125
Speaker 3:  for listening. This is episode one, as I said of our gaming series.

Speaker 3:  Every Sunday this month we are going to have different stories from the worlds

414
00:28:20,085 --> 00:28:23,925
Speaker 3:  of gaming. All about the five senses. There's also lots more on the

415
00:28:23,925 --> 00:28:27,285
Speaker 3:  gaming world to read at The Verge dot com. It's a cool website, we like it

416
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:30,325
Speaker 3:  a lot and actually there's a lot happening in the gaming world right now,

417
00:28:30,465 --> 00:28:33,085
Speaker 3:  so go check it out. We'll put some links in the show notes, but as always,
