Description: The Verge's Dieter Bohn dives into the messy past and uncertain future of Rich Communication Services, or RCS, a new texting standard that Google had been pushing for Android users.
2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,710
Speaker 1:  Sorry to interrupt. I'm going to go because there's breaking

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,580
Speaker 1:  RCS news. The carriers have basically formed a consortium to hijack

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,580
Speaker 1:  it and steal it away from Google. And I am the only person that can write

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,370
Speaker 1:  this story. So I got to go. Okay. I'll just tell people that you had to drop

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,670
Speaker 1:  for breaking RC. I'm going to just tell them exactly what happened.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,660
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I got to go make some calls. Bye bye.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,570
Speaker 1:  That's hilarious. Back in October, 2019,

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,880
Speaker 1:  I was out in some rented podcast studio doing the Vergecast.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,300
Speaker 1:  I couldn't get back to the office in time. And even though it's really not

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,020
Speaker 1:  a great idea to do during a podcast recording, I happened to check my

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,950
Speaker 1:  email and I saw something nuts. The big four

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,880
Speaker 1:  us cell phone carriers had agreed to form a new coalition to

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,840
Speaker 1:  support a new texting standard.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,800
Speaker 1:  I immediately bailed on the verge cast, sorry, Nila. I ran

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,770
Speaker 1:  out to my car that was parked in this random street. And I started making

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,400
Speaker 1:  calls. I was trying to get to the bottom of the so-called

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,220
Speaker 1:  new cross carrier messaging initiative. The

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,060
Speaker 1:  CCMI it was a consortium that could mean that we might finally

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,600
Speaker 1:  get rid of SMS texting and move on to a new

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
Speaker 1:  standard that Google had been pushing for Android users. It was called rich

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,870
Speaker 1:  communication services or

23
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,440
Speaker 1:  RCS. As I sat in my car

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,740
Speaker 1:  reporting and making calls, I learned that the carriers were promising to

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,860
Speaker 1:  create their own texting app, which sounded

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,760
Speaker 1:  horrible. So we all waited for a long time

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,420
Speaker 1:  for this bad plan to go into effect. And it never did that.

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,320
Speaker 1:  Blockbuster announcement was pretty much the last thing we heard about

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,040
Speaker 1:  CCMI T-Mobile eventually bought sprint and it took until

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,730
Speaker 1:  April of 2021 for the carriers to admit, and

31
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,180
Speaker 1:  only under lots of reporting pressure that they had given up on the

32
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,050
Speaker 1:  CCMI. Here's the thing about this

33
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,770
Speaker 1:  new texting standard RCS, almost every story about

34
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,610
Speaker 1:  it ends up feeling like this. There's a big splash makes you

35
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,600
Speaker 1:  think. Maybe, maybe we're going to finally be able to replace SMS

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,470
Speaker 1:  with something that's not limited to 160 characters of text.

37
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,440
Speaker 1:  Then time goes by and not much happens. And we wait some

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,400
Speaker 1:  more I'm Dieter Bohn. And this week on the verge

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,300
Speaker 1:  cast, special run of topic specific Tuesday episodes. I think it's

40
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,200
Speaker 1:  finally time that we really dig into RCS, where it came from, why

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,070
Speaker 1:  it matters, where it's going, and of course,

42
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,170
Speaker 1:  whether or not apple will ever support it on the

43
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:40,680
Speaker 1:  iPhone.

44
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,760
Speaker 1:  You probably know that smartphones really got started with the iPhone, but

45
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,510
Speaker 1:  did you know there was an innovative app driven smartphone six years

46
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,260
Speaker 1:  before it, I took off like a rocket. Everybody

47
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,560
Speaker 1:  wanted this product In a new documentary from the verge called

48
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,130
Speaker 1:  springboard, the secret history of the first real smartphone. We look at

49
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,640
Speaker 1:  a tiny startup called handspring that tried to create the modern phone

50
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,330
Speaker 1:  before anybody was ready for it. You can watch springboard now for

51
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,910
Speaker 1:  free on the verge TV app and learn more at the

52
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,040
Speaker 1:  verge.com/springboard. That's the

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,490
Speaker 1:  verge.com/springboard.

54
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,210
Speaker 1:  If you've heard of RCS, it's probably because you heard that it's supposed

55
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,200
Speaker 1:  to be Google solution for texting on Android phones. It is

56
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,980
Speaker 1:  better than SMS because it's internet based. Instead of using a weird

57
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,430
Speaker 1:  network hack, it offers features like better group chats, read

58
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,030
Speaker 1:  receipts, typing indicators and bigger image and video

59
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,660
Speaker 1:  attachments. RCS is not controlled by any single company, but

60
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,380
Speaker 1:  instead it's handled by the carriers to route messages or if they don't want

61
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,310
Speaker 1:  to Google can do it. There are a lot of details to get into, but

62
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,180
Speaker 1:  that's the basic gist of what RCS is, but to really

63
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,110
Speaker 1:  understand why Google has gone all in on RCS, you need to understand

64
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,800
Speaker 1:  that there's a rich and complicated history of messaging apps at

65
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,430
Speaker 1:  Google, and that RCS has its own history. That's

66
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,390
Speaker 1:  actually entirely separate from Google. So let's start with the history

67
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,290
Speaker 1:  of RCS and actually look back at SMS and what it meant, but

68
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,920
Speaker 1:  I promise this isn't going to go for like three plus hours, like Dan Carlin's

69
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,890
Speaker 1:  hardcore history podcast, but it is gonna take a minute. It's just, there

70
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,800
Speaker 1:  are some foundational concepts in this history that we're going to need to

71
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,310
Speaker 1:  know to understand what's happening with RCS.

72
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,120
Speaker 1:  So SMS stands for short messaging service, and it's been the way that

73
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,360
Speaker 1:  phones can text each other. Since phone started texting each other in the

74
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,350
Speaker 1:  nineties, in fact, phone carriers back then didn't realize that texting

75
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,310
Speaker 1:  would be a thing that people wanted to do. So it came later than

76
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,670
Speaker 1:  regular phone calls and worked by taking advantage of some of the parts of

77
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,630
Speaker 1:  the phone networks that carriers used for other technical things.

78
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,260
Speaker 1:  That's why SMS is text only and why it's limited to

79
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,190
Speaker 1:  160 characters because that's all that will fit. It's difficult

80
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,120
Speaker 1:  to imagine now, but for a long time, SMS messaging was a

81
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,050
Speaker 1:  big business for carriers. They literally charged by the

82
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,980
Speaker 1:  text and it took a long time for so-called unlimited messaging to

83
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,380
Speaker 1:  be included in most plans, who are you

84
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,860
Speaker 3:  Texting 50 times a day,

85
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,850
Speaker 1:  And then MMS multimedia messaging was a hack on top of the SMS

86
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,690
Speaker 1:  hack. And it costs even more money per message. That high price is

87
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,590
Speaker 1:  actually super important to our story here because that high price was a

88
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,470
Speaker 1:  big mistake from the carriers because SMS cost so much and

89
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,310
Speaker 1:  provided so little. When smartphones came around, there was a rush to

90
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,240
Speaker 1:  make texting apps that costs less or were free. They sprouted

91
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,080
Speaker 1:  up everywhere and they jockeyed for market share. There was Blackberry messaging

92
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,910
Speaker 1:  and WhatsApp and KakaoTalk and line and MSN messenger. I message

93
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,580
Speaker 1:  him Facebook messenger and so on. And so on. All of them either had, or some

94
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,730
Speaker 1:  of them still have lots of users depending on what part of the world you

95
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,390
Speaker 1:  lived in. In fact, if you're not in the United States, all of this trauma

96
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,080
Speaker 1:  around RCS, or I message seems really silly because the chances are

97
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,290
Speaker 1:  better that you and all of your friends and family have already all agreed

98
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,130
Speaker 1:  to use one single app to talk to each other. So when it comes to making

99
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,030
Speaker 1:  money off of texting, the carriers eventually lost out boo hoo.

100
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,870
Speaker 1:  Right? But even though a lot of those apps were placed SMS for a lot of

101
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,590
Speaker 1:  people, they didn't kill SMS entirely because SMS is the

102
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,370
Speaker 1:  default. It's the basic fallback that you can pretty much trust will work

103
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,880
Speaker 1:  with any mobile phone. You might not know if I can receive a group message,

104
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,840
Speaker 1:  but you definitely know that I can receive an SMS text anyway, because of

105
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,590
Speaker 1:  all of that free competition, the carriers were forced to eventually stop

106
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,520
Speaker 1:  charging extra for texting on most of their plans. But, and this

107
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,300
Speaker 1:  is the key part that meant that texting was almost never going to

108
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,080
Speaker 1:  be a moneymaker for carriers. Again, not really. So in

109
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,740
Speaker 1:  2007 way before you thought a bunch of carriers got

110
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,670
Speaker 1:  together and said, Hey, this SMS tech is old and dumb and we should

111
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,030
Speaker 1:  replace it. And a bunch of them said, sure, but there was no

112
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,570
Speaker 1:  incentive for them to actually do the work to change it. That was the

113
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,440
Speaker 1:  beginning of RCS, but it would continue to be a total, nothing

114
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,250
Speaker 1:  burger for over a decade. So that's the

115
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,940
Speaker 1:  history of SMS and the very beginning of RCS. Now what about the history

116
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,840
Speaker 1:  of messaging at Google? Look, I don't

117
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,470
Speaker 1:  have time to get into everything that Google tried and I definitely don't

118
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,340
Speaker 1:  have the emotional energy, but there is a short version that I already

119
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,210
Speaker 1:  did in a YouTube video when Google first announced RCS. So let's

120
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,900
Speaker 1:  listen to that. So in 2005, Google launched Google

121
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,990
Speaker 1:  talks, you might notice Google chat. It was really popular. It was really

122
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,410
Speaker 1:  good. So when Android launched in 2008, they included

123
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,220
Speaker 1:  alongside SMS because that's what you do in 2009, the iPhone

124
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,090
Speaker 1:  got push notifications, which made apps like WhatsApp gets super popular.

125
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,390
Speaker 1:  And then when they came to Android, also it got popular there. So Google

126
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,080
Speaker 1:  had a problem to solve. So in 2011, they didn't

127
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,170
Speaker 1:  solve it. They saw Facebook and they're like, we want some of that. So they

128
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,770
Speaker 1:  launched a Google plus, which had yet more chat apps in it. It has huddle

129
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,700
Speaker 1:  for texts and Hangouts, a video for video chat, not the same Hangouts.

130
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,210
Speaker 1:  It's, you know, though it was just confusing. Anyway, in late

131
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,780
Speaker 1:  2011, I message. And Facebook messenger launched and they were way

132
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,560
Speaker 1:  simpler than Google, what Google had. And so Google had to fix it again.

133
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,520
Speaker 1:  And so a couple of years later, in 2013, they launched Hangouts, which took

134
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Speaker 1:  all those other apps and combined them into a single app. And everything

135
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,440
Speaker 1:  was great for a couple of years. And then hang out, sit and get updated.

136
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,910
Speaker 1:  Google plus was like failing and they pulled texting out of it. And it was

137
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,750
Speaker 1:  just a big mess again. And so in 2016, Google's

138
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,560
Speaker 1:  like, we're going to fix it again. They launched aloe for text chat

139
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,220
Speaker 1:  and duo for video chat duo super-popular

140
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,210
Speaker 1:  Allo, not so much. Meanwhile, Hangouts turn into this

141
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,990
Speaker 1:  like enterprise slack competitor thing. I dunno, whatever. I haven't even

142
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,710
Speaker 1:  mentioned Google voice and Google wave and all the other crazy experiments

143
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,640
Speaker 1:  Google has been doing. It's been a rolling 10 year disaster, and

144
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,510
Speaker 1:  Google has to fix it. I mean, look at all this stuff,

145
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,380
Speaker 1:  what the Watts we made that video in 2018, that was

146
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,340
Speaker 1:  10 years after RCS was first proposed. And it was the moment that Google

147
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,150
Speaker 1:  made its big announcement that it was going all in on RCS as

148
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,750
Speaker 1:  the default texting solution for Android carriers around the world

149
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,170
Speaker 1:  said, oh, Hey, that's right. We had this RCS thing.

150
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,600
Speaker 1:  Okay, good luck with that. Google, when we made that video in April, 2018,

151
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,640
Speaker 1:  Google told me that it expected the switch over to RCS to take six to

152
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,420
Speaker 1:  12 months. It's now November of 2021.

153
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,180
Speaker 1:  And RCS is still not fully rolled

154
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,530
Speaker 1:  out.

155
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,190
Speaker 1:  Okay. With all of that history under our belt. Now it's time to

156
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,030
Speaker 1:  answer some questions. The most important one, I think gets to the

157
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,750
Speaker 1:  central tension of RCS as a standard. Is it a

158
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,710
Speaker 1:  carrier thing or is it a Google thing? So I spoke to

159
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,190
Speaker 1:  Sonata Hari, who is the senior director of communication products at

160
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,130
Speaker 1:  Google about precisely that question

161
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,250
Speaker 4:  And Google didn't create RCS. And like around

162
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,090
Speaker 4:  2015, where we got more involved, there were even like

163
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,900
Speaker 4:  different flavors of RCS. There was like a European

164
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,620
Speaker 4:  RCS, U S one. And so there was a

165
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,520
Speaker 4:  deviations before there was even any scale, the role that we played

166
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,180
Speaker 4:  in, you know, it was us as well as everyone else that was already engaged,

167
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,080
Speaker 4:  given that it is a telecom spec, was we really pushed for kind of

168
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,860
Speaker 4:  alignment on the set of capabilities, which ended up manifesting

169
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,430
Speaker 4:  itself as the universal profile, which is now the

170
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,340
Speaker 4:  GSM standard. You know, we were

171
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,910
Speaker 4:  participating along with the rest of the industry in terms of

172
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,780
Speaker 4:  aligning on one common definition of this and having one

173
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,160
Speaker 4:  common spec.

174
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,030
Speaker 1:  Now there are a lot and I mean, a lot of technical details behind

175
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,780
Speaker 1:  what Sonos is talking about here. For example, when she refers to different

176
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,530
Speaker 1:  flavors of RCS, what she means is that carriers literally used to have their

177
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,370
Speaker 1:  own proprietary versions of RCS that were incompatible with each other. So

178
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,300
Speaker 1:  like 80 and T and Verizon, for example, have their own custom texting

179
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,260
Speaker 1:  apps that you could install if you hated having good apps. And those

180
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,130
Speaker 1:  technically had RCS on the backend, but hopefully those days are going to

181
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,940
Speaker 1:  be behind a soon. Another thing is that when you send a text with

182
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,870
Speaker 1:  say WhatsApp, for example, there is one company that's in charge of making

183
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,530
Speaker 1:  sure it goes where it's supposed to the company that owns WhatsApp, Facebook,

184
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,020
Speaker 1:  or I guess Metta or whatever. But when you send an SMS or an

185
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,980
Speaker 1:  RCS, there are a lot of companies involved in routing that text

186
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,880
Speaker 1:  message and making sure that it gets to you so that universal profile that's

187
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,810
Speaker 1:  not as referred to is the standard way for that routing to happen so that

188
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,800
Speaker 1:  everybody can talk to everybody. So Google has been pushing for

189
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,580
Speaker 1:  a universal profile adoption, but a bunch of carriers haven't

190
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,570
Speaker 1:  updated to support it or even support RCS itself yet they just don't

191
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,560
Speaker 1:  seem to be interested. Lots of companies are also reticent to make deals

192
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,370
Speaker 1:  with Google. It turns out. So even though Google is pushing standards,

193
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,400
Speaker 1:  take a lot of time to get going. Obviously

194
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,910
Speaker 4:  The more people are involved in any problem that requires consensus that

195
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,600
Speaker 4:  you have, you know, it takes longer regardless of the problem.

196
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,590
Speaker 4:  However, you know, the benefits are, are pretty high because,

197
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,920
Speaker 4:  you know, especially in a world where we believe that communication is a

198
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,880
Speaker 4:  right, and everybody should be able to communicate with their phone in a

199
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,690
Speaker 4:  reliable and rich way. You know, the benefits are worth

200
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,110
Speaker 4:  the extra effort that's required to get into this. And you know, this is

201
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,470
Speaker 4:  my nature, you know, we're replacing something else that is a global standard

202
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,370
Speaker 4:  SMS, as old as it is. It has lasted the test of

203
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,240
Speaker 4:  time in the sense that it does have global adoption. And so I

204
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,780
Speaker 4:  do feel like it's a responsibility that we should not take lightly. And thus

205
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,350
Speaker 4:  the standard approaches is very, very important given that, you know, it

206
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,170
Speaker 4:  is replacing something that does meet the bar on that.

207
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,650
Speaker 4:  However, I do think, you know, obviously we have

208
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,430
Speaker 4:  exercise some flexibility on top of the standard in

209
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,300
Speaker 4:  terms of how we can advance our client to meet the end-user needs

210
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,750
Speaker 4:  of the modern user needs for messaging as well.

211
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,110
Speaker 1:  Just a little bit more technical detailed to understand some of the complication

212
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,470
Speaker 1:  here for messaging app to work. There's basically two parts, there's the

213
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,980
Speaker 1:  servers, but then there's also the client AKA the app on the

214
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,970
Speaker 1:  phone. And unlike SMS on Android, RCS only works with

215
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,810
Speaker 1:  specific approved client Habs. And so the features of

216
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,620
Speaker 1:  what RCS can do end up being a mix of what can be routed through all of those

217
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,280
Speaker 1:  servers, but more importantly, what features get added to the client

218
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,210
Speaker 1:  apps. So I started this whole section by asking if

219
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,930
Speaker 1:  RCS is a carrier thing or a Google thing. And now with all of these

220
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,230
Speaker 1:  technical details, we can answer that question. It's

221
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,950
Speaker 1:  yes, it's both. The carriers are in charge of the

222
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,640
Speaker 1:  standard and the servers and Google is in charge of

223
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,510
Speaker 1:  the app where the rubber hits the road or where the emoji

224
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,260
Speaker 1:  hits the chat box. And also technically Google can

225
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,250
Speaker 1:  also run some servers to route messages. The bottom line is that

226
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,850
Speaker 1:  it's messy and Google knows a thing or two about

227
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,660
Speaker 1:  messy, messy drama with messaging apps

228
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,620
Speaker 1:  recently, random audio reviews editor at ARS Technica wrote an amazing

229
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,280
Speaker 1:  overview of every single messaging app that Google has tried over the

230
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,100
Speaker 1:  years. We're going to link it in the show notes. I really encourage you to

231
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,370
Speaker 1:  read it because he brought up a bunch of apps that I had completely forgotten

232
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,150
Speaker 1:  about, but I wanted to talk to Ron because he is a person who can take

233
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,120
Speaker 1:  all this highfalutin open RCS, talked down a peg.

234
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,520
Speaker 1:  He's not,

235
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,490
Speaker 5:  I mean, RCS because it's a 12 or 13 year old standard

236
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,390
Speaker 5:  has ideas that we thought were a great idea, 12 or 13 years ago,

237
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,990
Speaker 5:  but it's missing a ton of things you would want from a modern messaging

238
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,920
Speaker 5:  standard like device support and encryption and a ton of other

239
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,370
Speaker 5:  features it's going to make SMS better, but you're going to go from the worst

240
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,180
Speaker 5:  messaging platform in the world to a slightly

241
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,480
Speaker 5:  worse messaging platform, but still the worst messaging platform in the world.

242
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,350
Speaker 1:  Wow. Yeah. So was the idea to replace SMS way back when they first were forming

243
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,230
Speaker 1:  it in the GSMs? Or was it some other random thing?

244
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,950
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean, SMS has carrier messaging used to be

245
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,580
Speaker 5:  important. Like they, they used to charge us money for SMS, right. It was

246
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,060
Speaker 5:  a huge revenue stream. And so it made sense to kind of keep that going and

247
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,570
Speaker 5:  keep updating carrier messaging. But I think as messaging

248
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,500
Speaker 5:  became commoditized, you know, everybody has an unlimited texting plan now

249
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,130
Speaker 5:  there's really no reason for them to, to be interested in updating it anymore.

250
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,760
Speaker 5:  So it's been, it's just kind of been hanging out and nobody's really sure

251
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,840
Speaker 5:  what

252
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,290
Speaker 1:  I would assume that the carriers would want to get off of SMS. They can,

253
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,170
Speaker 1:  I don't know, do something more interesting or I don't wanna use that random,

254
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,440
Speaker 1:  weird channel that it uses for something else or whatever. Why do you think

255
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,430
Speaker 1:  it took Google to start saying, Hey, no, this is our thing. And everyone

256
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,360
Speaker 1:  should start doing it to, you know, get carriers to even think about bothering

257
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,560
Speaker 1:  with it in the first place.

258
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,920
Speaker 5:  Well, like I said, revenue, I don't think the carriers are that interested

259
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,910
Speaker 5:  in getting off of SMS. Like w why would they, there's no bottom line

260
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,220
Speaker 5:  opportunity for them.

261
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,000
Speaker 1:  So the carriers had this RCS thing, but they had no incentive

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,870
Speaker 1:  to do anything with it. Google on the other hand had year after year of

263
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,740
Speaker 1:  bungled messaging apps. So Google had a huge incentive to figure

264
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,670
Speaker 1:  out messaging for Android, but Google knew it. Couldn't just launch another

265
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,600
Speaker 1:  app again, because Google had tried that and it didn't work. It was just

266
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,260
Speaker 1:  too much of a fight to get anybody to use a brand new Google app, but

267
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,220
Speaker 1:  maybe they could get this RCS thing to work and that the carriers

268
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,090
Speaker 1:  would go along. If they did, you know, that old Winston Churchill quote about

269
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,020
Speaker 1:  how democracy is the worst form of government, except every other one has

270
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,890
Speaker 1:  already been tried. Yeah. RCS is kind of like that for Google,

271
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,580
Speaker 1:  but also as Ron points out, don't forget that Google is

272
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,510
Speaker 1:  massive. And one reason it's tried so many things is because it's

273
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,270
Speaker 1:  such a big chaotic company.

274
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,200
Speaker 5:  I don't like talking about the company is like a monolith. I think the motivations

275
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,620
Speaker 5:  are individual product managers trying to launch a product. And I think we've

276
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,520
Speaker 5:  seen, you know, some product manager will launch aloe and then it won't

277
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,030
Speaker 5:  work. And then they will leave and go join Facebook. And then a new

278
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,600
Speaker 5:  person will show up and launch a new messaging app. And I

279
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,140
Speaker 5:  think RCS, you can give the utopia sales pitch for it where, oh, it's going

280
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,010
Speaker 5:  to work on every smartphone. And I, I think that's why they started,

281
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,730
Speaker 5:  like, they've done every messaging idea in the world. And this is just the

282
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,010
Speaker 5:  next one that no one has tried yet.

283
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,940
Speaker 1:  So whether it's a genuine desire to fix SMS, an honest attempt to

284
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,310
Speaker 1:  spread a standard or just PTSD from all those failed

285
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,270
Speaker 1:  attempts, Google is committed. It is all in on

286
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,110
Speaker 1:  RCS going forward. Okay, we're going to take a break.

287
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,040
Speaker 1:  And when we come back, we've got another question to answer. How's it going

288
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,610
Speaker 1:  with RCS,

289
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:17,700
Speaker 1:  Google.

290
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,160
Speaker 1:  We're back for our special Vergecast episode, focusing on RCS as

291
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,030
Speaker 1:  the new way that Android phones are supposed to text. Now,

292
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,740
Speaker 1:  Google announced this RCS change for Android in April,

293
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,410
Speaker 1:  2018 and figured it would take a year or so for most carriers to switch

294
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,400
Speaker 1:  over. But by June, 2019, barely any had, it

295
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,910
Speaker 1:  was not going well. So Google took matters into its own

296
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,690
Speaker 1:  hands. Now, do you remember how RCS requires both a

297
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,620
Speaker 1:  server and an app? Well, Google just started offering

298
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,130
Speaker 1:  RCS services to people who are using its messages app on

299
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,970
Speaker 1:  Android, whether or not their carrier had turned it on. Google just

300
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,360
Speaker 1:  started connecting people to Google's own servers.

301
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,350
Speaker 4:  We have also really invested in ensuring that RCS is

302
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,220
Speaker 4:  accessible even in markets and where carriers don't

303
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,970
Speaker 4:  have any plans or haven't built RCS. Yet, we just

304
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,420
Speaker 4:  offer the availability for users to be able to have

305
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,350
Speaker 4:  RCS, even before their carriers. We're kind of offering

306
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,250
Speaker 4:  it within their markets. So in many ways, we've just accelerated the

307
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,180
Speaker 4:  adoption. And again, you know, we've, we've done this in partnership with

308
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,170
Speaker 4:  the ecosystem as a whole, but we do feel that it's a responsibility we

309
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,560
Speaker 4:  have in terms of having our users have a better messaging

310
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,110
Speaker 4:  experience. That's not 30 years old.

311
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,770
Speaker 1:  Here's how it works. If a carrier wants to connect you to its

312
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,730
Speaker 1:  servers via RCS, Google lets the carrier handle routing

313
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,660
Speaker 1:  for your messages. But if your carrier doesn't want to do

314
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,380
Speaker 1:  RCS or can't get around to it or whatever, Google will just do it

315
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,950
Speaker 1:  for them. Now the technical details of how that

316
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,790
Speaker 1:  happens and how RCS messages work are about as interesting as you might

317
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,060
Speaker 1:  guess, the technical details of routing messages through servers might

318
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,810
Speaker 1:  be, but there is one thing that might seem really

319
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,770
Speaker 1:  obvious, but we should explicitly talk about it. The way that you get

320
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,190
Speaker 1:  RCS messages is via your phone number. Just like

321
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,090
Speaker 1:  SMS. This is a carrier standard after all. Even if it's Google,

322
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,510
Speaker 1:  that seems to be the one, doing all the work to push it. Now this is a whole

323
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,500
Speaker 1:  other podcast, but phone numbers, they're a very annoying and

324
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,400
Speaker 1:  I would go so far as to say horrible identification technology. Here's

325
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,630
Speaker 1:  random audio. Again,

326
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,500
Speaker 5:  The problem I have with RCS is that because it's made by the GMA, it relies

327
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,310
Speaker 5:  on a phone number and a SIM card and a phone bill. And that means

328
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,820
Speaker 5:  anything. That's not a phone cannot like natively send an RCS

329
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,540
Speaker 5:  message. Google has cooked up a few like weird pairing

330
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,320
Speaker 5:  systems where like you compare a website, your phone with a QR code. And

331
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,470
Speaker 5:  then if you type a message into the web browser, it gets forwarded to your

332
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,100
Speaker 5:  phone, which gets forwarded to the internet. But that's still not a native

333
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,920
Speaker 5:  application. Like I want a messaging service to work on a tablet and

334
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,850
Speaker 5:  a laptop and a desktop and a smartwatch and you know,

335
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,690
Speaker 5:  a brain implant and whatever other weird devices we come up with. So

336
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,470
Speaker 5:  like you can't, you can't go jogging and leave your smartphone at home and

337
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,370
Speaker 5:  get a message because everything, your phone is the center of your,

338
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,340
Speaker 5:  it has to be the center of your messaging life. If you use Austria

339
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,310
Speaker 1:  And like picking the phone number, seems like that was definitely like a

340
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,070
Speaker 1:  carrier capture thing. I think that one of the, one of the points you made

341
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,820
Speaker 1:  in your piece was there's like an immoral aspect to making the phone

342
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,220
Speaker 1:  number, the source of identity, because it's the thing that fundamentally

343
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,380
Speaker 1:  you're leasing. You have to pay a monthly bill to

344
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,800
Speaker 5:  Keep it. Yeah. I mean, that's as opposed to like an email address,

345
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,280
Speaker 5:  nobody technically really owns their email address or their phone number.

346
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,970
Speaker 5:  But like I probably have an email from Yahoo that's been abandoned for like

347
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,300
Speaker 5:  15 years that it probably still works. Whereas a phone number, if you ever

348
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,360
Speaker 5:  stopped paying the bill, they like take your identity from you. If you're

349
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Speaker 5:  using a phone number as identity and they will like give it to someone else,

350
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,200
Speaker 5:  like pretty quickly, which is, which is crazy. And if something

351
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,920
Speaker 5:  happens to you, you know, if you end up in the hospital or go to jail or

352
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,700
Speaker 5:  something to where you can't continually pay a phone bill, you just lose

353
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,480
Speaker 5:  your identity. And, and I think it causes a lot of problems for people that

354
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,260
Speaker 5:  want to borrow a phone. Also like if you can't afford a phone, it's pretty

355
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,590
Speaker 5:  easy to get on the internet. Like you can go to a library in New York city,

356
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,100
Speaker 5:  they replaced all the telephone boosts with like kiosks. You can just walk

357
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,790
Speaker 5:  up to and go on the internet. And if you use a phone number for

358
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,270
Speaker 5:  identity, you are locked out of all of these services

359
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,170
Speaker 1:  From Google's perspective, it really did want RCS to be

360
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:19,010
Speaker 1:  a universal standard, not a Google technology, even though

361
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,000
Speaker 1:  everybody associates it with Google right now. And since RCS started

362
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,630
Speaker 1:  as a telecom spec, well, what else were they going to use? But phone

363
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,650
Speaker 1:  numbers,

364
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,160
Speaker 4:  You know, a, we were looking at the RCS as a

365
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,060
Speaker 4:  telecom spec that was in place for numbers are, are a core part of

366
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,990
Speaker 4:  that. And also the lens that we ideally really want

367
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,860
Speaker 4:  as some nice to be upgraded. So in some ways it's really important that the

368
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,850
Speaker 4:  identity works for the global user base that uses

369
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,720
Speaker 4:  SMS today. And, you know, there are many Google users, but not the

370
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,620
Speaker 4:  whole world uses a Google accounts that may also have its own challenges

371
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,610
Speaker 4:  in terms of whether people want to use that as their identity or not.

372
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,330
Speaker 4:  And SMS for all of its problems. Like, you know, it is kind of a

373
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,840
Speaker 4:  known notion and it is a known identifier that from a global

374
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,630
Speaker 4:  perspective has a pretty broad reach and

375
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,380
Speaker 4:  understanding. And again, you know, we were very much kind of

376
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,370
Speaker 4:  aligned with us back overall and what the identifiers

377
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,520
Speaker 4:  should be. And so from that perspective, it's, it's global and it's

378
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,850
Speaker 4:  reachable. And I think that's really, really important when we think of this

379
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,850
Speaker 4:  bingo messaging protocol that works for anybody anywhere in the

380
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,280
Speaker 4:  world.

381
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,130
Speaker 1:  Okay, we're going to take one more quick break and then we're going to get

382
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,060
Speaker 1:  into what's next for RCS and Google's messages app.

383
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,510
Speaker 1:  And you know, we also need to talk about whether or not it's coming to the

384
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:53,730
Speaker 1:  iPhone.

385
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,460
Speaker 4:  We're back. And it's time to talk about what's next for

386
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,970
Speaker 4:  RCS. The good news is that after five years of

387
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,090
Speaker 4:  mucking about Google, just up and spent much of

388
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,540
Speaker 4:  2021 cutting deals with the big

389
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,470
Speaker 4:  three us carriers, there's only three now, sorry,

390
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,250
Speaker 4:  the deals were this in 2022 Google's messages app

391
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,180
Speaker 4:  will be the default texting app on every Android phone sold by

392
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,940
Speaker 4:  Verizon T-Mobile at, at and T.

393
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,840
Speaker 1:  That seems like not a big deal, but actually it's a huge deal.

394
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,740
Speaker 1:  Because again, remember that for RCS to work, you need both the server

395
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,280
Speaker 1:  and the app and in the world of Android, not

396
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,030
Speaker 1:  everybody uses the same texting app and a lot of those apps don't

397
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,710
Speaker 1:  support RCS. So if different people using different

398
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,550
Speaker 1:  texting apps, RCS doesn't happen. Having everybody on the

399
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,360
Speaker 1:  same app means that RCS can finally get going, but

400
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,110
Speaker 1:  also having everybody on the Google messages app means that Google can build

401
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:56,980
Speaker 1:  stuff on top of RCS. If both people are

402
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,250
Speaker 1:  using the Google messages, apps, then those apps end up talking directly

403
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,120
Speaker 1:  to each other and Google can turn on extra features like

404
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,780
Speaker 1:  end-to-end encryption for one-on-one chats. So now as a Hari

405
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,440
Speaker 1:  also hinted that maybe some other features might becoming like

406
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,370
Speaker 1:  encryption for group chats or better multi-device support. But you know,

407
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,200
Speaker 1:  first there are some baby steps we still have to take.

408
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,520
Speaker 4:  Let's just take the us as a market. We actually need to launch our

409
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,510
Speaker 4:  CS with the who S carriers. We need to make sure all of these

410
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:29,290
Speaker 4:  carriers can talk to each other and be able to talk to users in

411
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,220
Speaker 4:  Europe and India, et cetera. So the global vision needs to, in many ways,

412
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,670
Speaker 4:  the execution really, really needs to land. And then, you know, it's really

413
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,480
Speaker 4:  important that this happens multi-device so we need to make sure

414
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,110
Speaker 4:  that this works not just on, but on watch on, on

415
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,830
Speaker 4:  desktop, on all the different devices that users really expect their messaging

416
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:51,700
Speaker 4:  experience for. And then obviously we have started the journey on

417
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,540
Speaker 4:  antenna encryption. We still need to kind of fill that out. Obviously

418
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,750
Speaker 4:  we've started with one-on-one. We need to complete that picture

419
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,840
Speaker 4:  holistically. And then there's other things that I can think of. Like we

420
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,260
Speaker 4:  see so many communications move from email to

421
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,130
Speaker 4:  messaging. When I look at like the capabilities on messages versus

422
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,880
Speaker 4:  like Gmail, there's so many capabilities that we built in

423
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,840
Speaker 4:  Gmail for users to just be able to manage their inbox. A lot of those

424
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,800
Speaker 4:  things, I think also messaging clients as a whole need to evolve in

425
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,790
Speaker 4:  terms of we get personal messages, we get business messages. There's different

426
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:28,780
Speaker 4:  ways of managing important things, priority things, et

427
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,620
Speaker 4:  cetera, that I think those capabilities are going to evolve as more and more

428
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,680
Speaker 4:  communication kind of centers around messaging as a

429
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,870
Speaker 4:  whole,

430
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:41,650
Speaker 1:  By the way, there is one other confusing bit about RCS that I haven't mentioned

431
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,460
Speaker 1:  it's that in the app itself, Google calls it chat, but Google also

432
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,030
Speaker 1:  has another app that's called Google chat, but they're two different things.

433
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,090
Speaker 1:  It's very annoying. It's not my fault,

434
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,930
Speaker 1:  hopefully in a year, that might be the only confusing thing about

435
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:59,860
Speaker 1:  RCS that we have to worry about. I'm just kidding.

436
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,100
Speaker 1:  Obviously. There's another thing to worry about. There's an elephant in the

437
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,090
Speaker 1:  RCS room, or rather there's a missing elephant, a ghost

438
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,150
Speaker 1:  elephant. This is a bad metaphor. I'm talking about the

439
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:14,080
Speaker 1:  iPhone on

440
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,500
Speaker 1:  the iPhone. You've got iMessage. And then it falls back to

441
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,460
Speaker 1:  SMS on Android. You have RCS and it will

442
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,120
Speaker 1:  also fall back to SMS, but RCS, isn't supposed to be an

443
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,020
Speaker 1:  Android thing. It's supposed to be the thing that replaces SMS.

444
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,890
Speaker 1:  So will the iPhone ever support the thing that's supposed to

445
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,640
Speaker 1:  replace SMS? Will it ever support RCS? Because if

446
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,580
Speaker 1:  RCS becomes a standard and actually replaces SMS, Apple's

447
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,570
Speaker 1:  going to have to support it. Right? Right. I have

448
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,410
Speaker 1:  asked this question to apple many times and the

449
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,340
Speaker 1:  answer is always the same. No comment. I also asked

450
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,610
Speaker 1:  Sinaz over at Google, what her perspective is.

451
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,390
Speaker 4:  I don't work at apple. I do believe that, you know, the point

452
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,380
Speaker 4:  of an open spec is one that everyone can participate

453
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,310
Speaker 4:  in. I think they all it to their users as well. And

454
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:11,240
Speaker 4:  it's it's time that, you know, the industry as a whole, a lot of the people

455
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,170
Speaker 4:  that are still using SMS, they can have rich messaging. They can

456
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,950
Speaker 4:  have typing indicators, they can message over wifi. They can have

457
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,940
Speaker 4:  unbroken group chats and send high quality photos. And it's all

458
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,840
Speaker 4:  based on an open standard. And, you know, I think that the skin

459
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,910
Speaker 4:  benefit all of our users.

460
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,090
Speaker 1:  And if you think about it, that's actually kind of a strong statement that

461
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,870
Speaker 1:  apple would quote, owe it to their users. Unquote, want an

462
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,530
Speaker 1:  even stronger statement. Look no further than Google VP

463
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,400
Speaker 1:  Hiroshi Lockheimer who is in charge of Android and RCS and a whole

464
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,375
Speaker 1:  bunch of other stuff. Here's the tweet from him on October 7th, 2021,

465
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,260
Speaker 1:  where Hiroshi was commenting on how SMS breaks, I message group

466
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,830
Speaker 1:  chats. Here's a quote group chats don't need to break this way. There

467
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,670
Speaker 1:  exists a really clear solution. Here's an open

468
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:02,300
Speaker 1:  invitation to the folks who can make this right. We are here to

469
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,260
Speaker 1:  help by the way, really clear solution was in capital letters because

470
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,130
Speaker 1:  RCS, it was a acronym joke. They make dad jokes at Google

471
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:14,000
Speaker 1:  too. I'm just saying it's cute. Right? Well, if I've learned anything

472
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,690
Speaker 1:  from Twitter, tweeting is not the same thing as doing. So I actually asked

473
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,550
Speaker 1:  Sinaz about this tweet.

474
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,480
Speaker 4:  I honestly, I don't know. I don't have knowledge to that.

475
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,450
Speaker 4:  I do. Like, I don't know if she's doing stuff,

476
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:29,240
Speaker 1:  But you, you specifically, aren't calling up apple every day, asking them

477
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,270
Speaker 1:  if they're going to adopt RCS.

478
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,500
Speaker 4:  I don't have them on speed

479
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,220
Speaker 4:  dial.

480
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,210
Speaker 1:  We ended last week's Tuesday episode by pointing out that the

481
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:45,080
Speaker 1:  iPhone would probably never adopt USBC. And

482
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,710
Speaker 1:  now we're ending this episode with a big old question mark about the

483
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,460
Speaker 1:  iPhone and RCS. The fact that apple is

484
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,060
Speaker 1:  opting out of two messy and complicated standards with the

485
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,930
Speaker 1:  iPhone is not lost on me. It makes sense for the company,

486
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,800
Speaker 1:  even though I personally think that apple could go a long way towards

487
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,340
Speaker 1:  cleaning up both of these messages, if it would engage with them. But we

488
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,940
Speaker 1:  know that apple thinks I iMessage is a competitive advantage. We've seen

489
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,750
Speaker 1:  the emails where executives shot down the idea of bringing a message to

490
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,440
Speaker 1:  Android, because it would be bad for iPhone sales, which means

491
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,340
Speaker 1:  that well, eventually RCS could be a real true universal

492
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,330
Speaker 1:  standard, but in the meantime, it's messy. And we

493
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:30,110
Speaker 1:  live in the meantime, if you're an Android user talking to other

494
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,980
Speaker 1:  Android users in 2022, the default texting experience

495
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,650
Speaker 1:  might finally, finally, finally finally start to be

496
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:41,490
Speaker 1:  decent and relatively modern. And if that happens, maybe it'll be

497
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,390
Speaker 1:  the I-phones that start breaking group chats. And that could put some pressure

498
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,990
Speaker 1:  on apple, but here's my pressure. I think texting should be

499
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,500
Speaker 1:  private by default and SMS messages are not

500
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,250
Speaker 1:  encrypted. So if a government wants to force your carrier to

501
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,210
Speaker 1:  share those messages, the carrier is able to do it. Heck it doesn't actually

502
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,020
Speaker 1:  take that much force. Sometimes. Now there are lots of ways to encrypt

503
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,890
Speaker 1:  text messages. I use signal and I like it a lot, but none of

504
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,730
Speaker 1:  those ways are universal and none of them are the default across

505
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,150
Speaker 1:  different devices in the way that SMS and theoretically

506
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,930
Speaker 1:  RCS are. I know that apple cares about

507
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,920
Speaker 1:  privacy, especially the privacy of its customers. I

508
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,880
Speaker 1:  just wonder why it seems to stop caring about protecting that privacy.

509
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,610
Speaker 1:  When those customers happen to be texting Android

510
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,250
Speaker 1:  users, Hey, there's always

511
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,420
Speaker 1:  2023.

512
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,170
Speaker 1:  This episode of the Vergecast was made by Andrew Moreno, Liam, James and

513
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,100
Speaker 1:  me Dieter Bohn, special. Thanks to <inaudible> for joining us this

514
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,060
Speaker 1:  week. The Vergecast we'll be back on Friday for the chat show. And my Tuesday

515
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,430
Speaker 1:  episode is going to return next week. Thanks for listening.
