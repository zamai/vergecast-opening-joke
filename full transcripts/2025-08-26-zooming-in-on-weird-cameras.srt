Description: This week on The Vergecast, Chris Niccolls and Jordan Drake of PetaPixel’s YouTube channel join The Verge’s Allison Johnson and Vjeran Pavic to geek out about the last half-decade of camera advancements — the good, the bad, and the Sigma BF of it all.

Then, Allison is joined by Verge News Editor and fellow phone nerd Dominic Preston to help answer a boatload of listener questions from people contemplating which smartphone to buy next. They help navigate the intricacies of living in a mixed iOS/Android household to the best options for someone who wants a headphone jack (spoiler alert: there aren’t many).

It’s a mega-hotline-turned-therapy session for iPhone Mini owners reluctant to let go of their tiny phones in a world where phones come in two sizes: big and bigger.




2
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:07,115
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of small

3
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:11,075
Speaker 2:  phones that are very tired and just wanna take a little rest. I'm

4
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:14,515
Speaker 2:  your host, Alison Johnson, and on today's show I'm talking about two of my

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,635
Speaker 2:  very favorite things, small phones and weird cameras.

6
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:22,475
Speaker 2:  First, I'll be joined by some old friends at PetaPixel who are

7
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:25,835
Speaker 2:  gonna talk to me about what's been happening in the camera industry over

8
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:29,635
Speaker 2:  the last five years. Then Dominic Preston's gonna jump on and

9
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:33,555
Speaker 2:  we are gonna tackle a huge pile of listener questions in a mega

10
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:37,595
Speaker 2:  hotline segment. All that is coming up right after the break,

11
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:38,835
Speaker 2:  so stay tuned.

12
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:29,475
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. I am here with some of my very favorite

13
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:33,395
Speaker 2:  kinds of people, which is to say camera nerds. I

14
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:36,995
Speaker 2:  am joined by the faces of PetaPixel

15
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:40,955
Speaker 2:  YouTube channel. We've got Jordan Drake, of course,

16
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,995
Speaker 2:  you know, co-host, editor, videographer. Hello

17
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:45,395
Speaker 2:  Jordan.

18
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:48,875
Speaker 6:  Occasionally show up on camera. Yes. Yeah. Yes,

19
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:50,195
Speaker 2:  Yes. Important to note.

20
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:54,235
Speaker 6:  Doing all the posts to make the other person look fantastic.

21
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:56,635
Speaker 2:  It's the important job. Already

22
00:02:56,635 --> 00:03:00,405
Speaker 6:  Looked fantastic right from the start. I twist a couple

23
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:02,205
Speaker 6:  knobs, you know, I dial some dials.

24
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:04,845
Speaker 7:  You're putting polish on a diamond ring. Come on.

25
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:08,805
Speaker 2:  Oh my goodness. Okay, so this is setting the tenor for our show.

26
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:13,005
Speaker 2:  Thank you guys. That is Chris Nichols, you know, host

27
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:17,245
Speaker 2:  hi photographer, kind of man about town. Oh,

28
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:20,245
Speaker 7:  I appreciate that. Yeah, that's true. That's true. Well

29
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:24,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah, thanks for coming on. And I'm joined by Veen Pak, who's our

30
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:28,645
Speaker 2:  supervising producer here at The Verge. Also a camera nerd and

31
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:31,645
Speaker 2:  tests the weird cameras we get in. Is that fair?

32
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:35,325
Speaker 8:  I guess some of them are flying. Most of 'em are flying. If you can get him

33
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:36,005
Speaker 8:  in the US

34
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:37,245
Speaker 7:  Oh, I see.

35
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:38,885
Speaker 8:  A lot harder nowadays.

36
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:39,965
Speaker 2:  Good. If you can get

37
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,405
Speaker 7:  'em those cameras. It's been

38
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:42,725
Speaker 8:  A big year for weird cameras.

39
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:44,405
Speaker 6:  We'll have to touch on that. Yeah,

40
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:48,005
Speaker 2:  I, I am so ready to talk about weird cameras. Maybe that's, I'll back up

41
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,845
Speaker 2:  just a little bit and like set the context for how we all know

42
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:55,805
Speaker 2:  each other. So the two of you are at PetaPixel now, you know,

43
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:59,565
Speaker 2:  long running photography website. Previously we all worked

44
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:03,605
Speaker 2:  together at DP Review. So we've been nerding out about camera stuff for a

45
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:07,325
Speaker 2:  while now. You guys have been doing this for forever, you know, camera store

46
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:11,085
Speaker 2:  tv. You've got like 15 years of making videos

47
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:14,645
Speaker 2:  about cameras under your belt. So I have, I have

48
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:18,485
Speaker 2:  lured you here under the guise of, of hanging

49
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,565
Speaker 2:  out and just like catching up. I feel like we are

50
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:26,325
Speaker 2:  usually under extreme duress when we all hang out. It's like

51
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:29,925
Speaker 2:  at a live event we're running around. It's like very sweaty and hard to catch

52
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:33,805
Speaker 2:  up. Yes. And I've been kind of like out of the camera

53
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:37,605
Speaker 2:  game for like the last five years And I need a little bit of a

54
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:42,245
Speaker 2:  refresher on what has happened. So you three

55
00:04:42,425 --> 00:04:44,485
Speaker 2:  are the very people to talk to about

56
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:47,205
Speaker 7:  This. Nice. Yeah. Well thanks for having us. This is great.

57
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,645
Speaker 2:  I'm so excited. Give me kind of like your

58
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:55,045
Speaker 2:  takes on, what have been some of the kind of like

59
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:58,805
Speaker 2:  landmark or standout launches or maybe just

60
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:02,885
Speaker 2:  innovations like in the camera technology space,

61
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:06,965
Speaker 2:  you know, in the past maybe five years, like Verin, do you have like a,

62
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:09,005
Speaker 2:  a first thought on this

63
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:13,565
Speaker 8:  In five years? What is happening in five years? Olympus went away,

64
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:15,885
Speaker 8:  but they're still making camera under a different brand. Yes.

65
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:16,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

66
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:20,445
Speaker 8:  Fuji became like one of the hottest cameras out there in L 100 and

67
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:24,565
Speaker 8:  last two have been insanely popular and that's been a lot of

68
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:24,725
Speaker 8:  fun.

69
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:29,965
Speaker 8:  We've also just like went all the way back to the two thousands and are now

70
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:33,925
Speaker 8:  taking photos with like Olympus Mu and oh, oh my gosh.

71
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:37,965
Speaker 8:  You know, point in truths with a lot of just like high key flash

72
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:41,845
Speaker 8:  photography and, but no, a lot, a lot more has happened.

73
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:45,325
Speaker 8:  All of the cameras can out film like incredible video to

74
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:46,245
Speaker 8:  for

75
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:46,925
Speaker 7:  Sure. Yeah,

76
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:48,085
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:52,285
Speaker 7:  I think to add on that, yeah, I mean video is certainly a huge thing that's

78
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:56,125
Speaker 7:  happened in the five years, which makes Jordan happy and me indifferent.

79
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:56,605
Speaker 7:  And then

80
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:02,125
Speaker 7:  I would say also another big change is just how everybody's

81
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,925
Speaker 7:  caught up. You know, five years ago there was more variety in how good

82
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:09,765
Speaker 7:  people's auto focusing was and what their capabilities were. Now I feel like

83
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:14,045
Speaker 7:  the sensors are all very similar. Everybody's got good dynamic range.

84
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:18,045
Speaker 7:  Most players have very comparable auto focus now at this point.

85
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:21,765
Speaker 7:  Everybody's rocking subject detection like, you know, it's kind of like all

86
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:24,925
Speaker 7:  the trends that one person has started, everybody else has caught up to and

87
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:28,205
Speaker 7:  jumped on. So yeah, it's kind of a time now where camera

88
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:31,685
Speaker 7:  design I think is more important and has to be more exciting than anything

89
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:31,805
Speaker 7:  else.

90
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:36,645
Speaker 8:  We've definitely fixed the image quality issue like a while ago.

91
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:39,045
Speaker 8:  A hundred percent. We don't complain about image quality anymore.

92
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:40,045
Speaker 7:  It's no, it's

93
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:43,365
Speaker 6:  Forbidden that that's what's so interesting, like the image quality thing

94
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:47,485
Speaker 6:  is something every year we looked at as the primary thing like oh we got

95
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:51,245
Speaker 6:  more megapixels, it's better in low light now we're actually seeing the opposite

96
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,885
Speaker 6:  thing happen over the last five. If you look at the higher end cameras,

97
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:58,445
Speaker 6:  they're like, look, we can make our picture quality a little bit worse in

98
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:01,645
Speaker 6:  exchange for speed. Mm. Because the speed is gonna be better for that auto

99
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:05,605
Speaker 6:  focus and burst shooting and all that video stuff that's happening. So yeah,

100
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:09,405
Speaker 6:  it's kind of funny. I still look back to cameras, you know, from back when

101
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:13,285
Speaker 6:  you were working Allison, like a D eight 50 from Nikon and I'm like,

102
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:16,925
Speaker 6:  that still takes better pictures than even top of the line pro cameras

103
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:21,085
Speaker 6:  at this point. Oh wow. But the new stuff does way better video, way better

104
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:24,325
Speaker 6:  focus. Yeah. Much faster burst rates, that kind of stuff. So that's kind

105
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:28,165
Speaker 6:  of a compromise they've been willing to make. Yeah. These

106
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:32,045
Speaker 2:  Days. Can someone explain to me what global shutter is? Does that

107
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:35,885
Speaker 2:  tie into the like speed thing? Like Yes, with the auto

108
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:36,205
Speaker 2:  focus

109
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:40,845
Speaker 7:  It does but but I would say in, in our world of

110
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:44,365
Speaker 7:  photography, only one player has actually incorporated it properly. So

111
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:48,205
Speaker 7:  you know the Sony A nine three is a very cool camera, has global shutter.

112
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:52,285
Speaker 7:  It means you can fire full electronic shutter, no rolling shutter issues

113
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:56,205
Speaker 7:  whatsoever. No flashy problems either. The wibbly wobblies. Yeah

114
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:59,325
Speaker 7:  none of the, none of the wibbly wobblies and stuff. And of course it unlocks

115
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:02,965
Speaker 7:  insanely fast burst rates. And Sony of course have fantastic auto focus.

116
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,845
Speaker 7:  So it's very much a purpose built sports and action

117
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:10,765
Speaker 7:  camera. But you know, kinda like what Jordan was talking about, you do sacrifice

118
00:08:10,805 --> 00:08:14,685
Speaker 7:  a bit of dynamic range, megapixel count, that kind of stuff. Really it's

119
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:18,485
Speaker 7:  made for a specific goal and that is to get as many shots even

120
00:08:18,485 --> 00:08:22,325
Speaker 7:  with flashes fly. Like it's a great paparazzi red carpet camera, you know,

121
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:25,965
Speaker 7:  great video capabilities. But we're seeing that also with stack

122
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:28,885
Speaker 7:  sensors in general, which don't quite get there, but do a lot of what that

123
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:31,965
Speaker 7:  does. And that's probably another big change in the last five years. Just

124
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:34,685
Speaker 7:  the proliferation of high quality stack sensors.

125
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:39,085
Speaker 2:  Okay. And stack sensors like BSI, right?

126
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:42,605
Speaker 2:  Like there's layers of pixels and

127
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:46,885
Speaker 7:  Beyond the BSII would say. Yeah,

128
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:50,805
Speaker 6:  I was just gonna say like the BSI is what we saw previously and then the

129
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:53,725
Speaker 6:  stack sensors, they've just put the electronics right on the chip and that's

130
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:57,525
Speaker 6:  again giving us that faster readout for that other stuff. But again, a slightly

131
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:58,605
Speaker 6:  worse image quality than

132
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:02,445
Speaker 2:  We had before. Okay. That's so interesting that that image quality is

133
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:05,645
Speaker 2:  like a thing people are fine with kind of

134
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,285
Speaker 2:  sacrificing a little bit.

135
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:10,845
Speaker 7:  Everybody's kind of caught up to this idea that image quality isn't the be

136
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:14,885
Speaker 7:  end all 'cause they're all good and now people are, as we've talked about,

137
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:18,565
Speaker 7:  preferring bad image quality. Right? They're preferring

138
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:22,325
Speaker 7:  cameras with tiny sensors and they're going analog and, and

139
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:26,045
Speaker 7:  we've seen a real resurgence of lenses that are

140
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:30,445
Speaker 7:  designed to look like old vintage lenses along with all the flaws and and

141
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:34,365
Speaker 7:  failures and issues with those lenses. For a little while there it was

142
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:38,285
Speaker 7:  like an arms race to get the greatest, latest and greatest

143
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:39,765
Speaker 7:  mirrorless camera out on the market.

144
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:40,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

145
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:44,325
Speaker 6:  It's an arms race to make the image a little bit shittier now is where we're

146
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:44,405
Speaker 6:  at.

147
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:44,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

148
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:49,005
Speaker 2:  It seemed like it. Yeah. Let's talk about compact cameras

149
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:53,165
Speaker 2:  'cause I am, I think just as confused as

150
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:57,045
Speaker 2:  anyone about what is happening. I mean you guys sold compact cameras

151
00:09:57,545 --> 00:10:01,205
Speaker 2:  to people. Yes. Many, many years ago. Brand new all, all of a sudden they're

152
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:01,325
Speaker 2:  back.

153
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:05,165
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Not even used on eBay. It was brand like someone actually came in and

154
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:09,085
Speaker 7:  gave us $900 for this tiny crappy little camera God. And

155
00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:12,245
Speaker 7:  they loved every second of it and it fit, fit in an Altoids mint container

156
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,165
Speaker 7:  and they were so happy. Oh yeah. Yeah. Those are the days.

157
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:19,765
Speaker 2:  Verin, what was your, did you have a crappy little digital camera like

158
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:20,605
Speaker 2:  back in the day?

159
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:25,125
Speaker 8:  Back in the day I had a lot of Sony cyber shots. Okay.

160
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,885
Speaker 8:  If you gimme like 12 seconds I can grab two of them.

161
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,685
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Yes please. Hold on. Sorry.

162
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:34,925
Speaker 2:  It looks like a tape recorder. No, I had one that did that

163
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,885
Speaker 2:  too. I had that. That's like super thin.

164
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:41,725
Speaker 8:  Yeah, there's that one. There's another one which is probably a year

165
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:46,205
Speaker 8:  later. Okay. Like these companies we're making cameras like constantly.

166
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:46,645
Speaker 8:  It

167
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:46,725
Speaker 7:  Was

168
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:47,245
Speaker 2:  A lot of fun. So

169
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:49,245
Speaker 8:  Many. This is maybe

170
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:49,845
Speaker 7:  The one Oh

171
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:50,085
Speaker 2:  Oh,

172
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:53,285
Speaker 7:  Look at that. Yeah, that's the one that Sydnee was rocking. Yeah. That

173
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,245
Speaker 8:  Is beautiful. Yeah, I went back home, I got the Chargers, I got the memory

174
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:58,605
Speaker 8:  sticks, I got a memory card

175
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:00,045
Speaker 7:  Reader, Sony memory sticks.

176
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:03,645
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Pro duo as well. Or pro or duo.

177
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:05,325
Speaker 2:  Remember you're also

178
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:09,405
Speaker 8:  This still work. There was like another, another Sony camera

179
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:13,205
Speaker 8:  that I had to use reverse image search to actually find out the real

180
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:17,605
Speaker 8:  model of it. It was, I don't know how to describe it, I

181
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:20,605
Speaker 8:  just dunno how to describe it. It was like a tiny little, think about like

182
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:23,005
Speaker 8:  a pillbox and then you can rotate the lens.

183
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:23,685
Speaker 7:  Oh yes.

184
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:24,645
Speaker 8:  The lens was only,

185
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:25,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah, Nikon and Sony did those.

186
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:29,045
Speaker 7:  So here's a question though. Did you guys actually use those back in the

187
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:32,925
Speaker 7:  day or did you kind of rediscover them now? Right. Because you know, we

188
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,405
Speaker 7:  sold those in the store and, and we played with all those cameras and tested

189
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:40,125
Speaker 7:  them out and like yeah they're garbage. Like the menus are terrible and

190
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,325
Speaker 7:  everything's slow and the screens are bad, you know, and the image quality

191
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:46,965
Speaker 7:  is fun. Sure. But it was funny but the designs were so

192
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:50,445
Speaker 7:  interesting. Like that was the time where manufacturers would just throw

193
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:54,125
Speaker 7:  everything at the wall to see what would stick. And it was really exciting.

194
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:57,925
Speaker 7:  All these wacky, strange designs that you would never, ever take

195
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,965
Speaker 7:  risks on nowadays. Although I would say that, you know, some of the companies

196
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:03,605
Speaker 7:  are now starting to come around and try some stuff again, which is kind

197
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:07,445
Speaker 2:  Of cool. Yeah. I wonder how much of the digital camera renaissance is about

198
00:12:07,445 --> 00:12:11,085
Speaker 2:  people discovering that. It's like nice to hold a camera and use

199
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:14,925
Speaker 2:  you're, when you're so used to using a smartphone. Yeah, the weird

200
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:17,045
Speaker 2:  factor is pretty good too. But

201
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:20,685
Speaker 7:  This is just the novelty. Is that what people are loving now? I is like the

202
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:23,765
Speaker 7:  novelty because we had to, we were, we were in the trenches, you know what

203
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:27,485
Speaker 7:  I mean? And it was horrible and, and now I think people like rediscovering

204
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:31,365
Speaker 7:  or like, oh this is so different and it's so like novel. Yeah. But

205
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:34,485
Speaker 7:  no it was just garbage at the time. But like yeah. Yeah

206
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:38,645
Speaker 2:  I did carry around my little cyber shot and took pictures of friends and

207
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:42,365
Speaker 2:  it was just like that was the only, only option, you know? Yeah.

208
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,685
Speaker 2:  It's just weird to think of it like that. Jordan, you have a camera in your

209
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:46,725
Speaker 2:  hands out. Yeah, I wanna

210
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,525
Speaker 6:  See it. Yeah. So the last time I saw you Allison, I was waving this thing

211
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:53,285
Speaker 6:  around. I've put a video out since, but if you look at it, I think this is

212
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:57,205
Speaker 6:  really cool 'cause this is a Kodak V seven 70 and it is kind

213
00:12:57,205 --> 00:13:01,045
Speaker 6:  of the origin to the smartphone camera solution. Oh. So they had this

214
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:04,525
Speaker 6:  super thin thing. They're like, well we can't make the zoom any bigger,

215
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:09,005
Speaker 6:  the lens any wider, any brighter. So they just put two complete cameras in

216
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:12,485
Speaker 6:  here. So it's, oh my god. A zoom lens and then an ultra wide. And there are

217
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:15,885
Speaker 6:  two separate sensors in there as well. So it's kind of, they came up with

218
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:18,605
Speaker 6:  the solution before the smartphone manufacturers did.

219
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,685
Speaker 7:  Well even this, this is my favorite camera, this is the Panasonic GM five.

220
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:24,925
Speaker 7:  It's the greatest camera of all time. Oh my God. Yes. We just made it. Yeah,

221
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:28,325
Speaker 7:  we just made a video about it and it our, that was like one of our biggest

222
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:32,285
Speaker 7:  first day views. Like, it's crazy because everybody loves this

223
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:34,445
Speaker 7:  stuff. Again, it's, it's like a renaissance. I love

224
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:38,365
Speaker 2:  It. Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk about weird cameras 'cause I feel like there

225
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:42,005
Speaker 2:  is kind of a natural like synergy. Yeah.

226
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:43,045
Speaker 7:  These were all weird.

227
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:46,365
Speaker 2:  They're all super weird. There was kind of like a,

228
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,125
Speaker 2:  a smooshing where like every camera design sort of like became

229
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,205
Speaker 2:  the same. And I think that's happened with smartphones too. Yes.

230
00:13:54,425 --> 00:13:54,645
Speaker 7:  Yep.

231
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:58,845
Speaker 2:  But in the very recent past we have seen some,

232
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:03,405
Speaker 2:  I would say really weird out there kind of camera designs

233
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:07,525
Speaker 2:  and I'm all about it. Like, I dunno, what

234
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:10,005
Speaker 2:  is your guys feelings about some of these?

235
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:13,645
Speaker 7:  I dunno, I think we're gonna fight. I, I don't know. What should we start

236
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:17,485
Speaker 7:  with? Like, you know, I think it's as an overarching theme

237
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:20,485
Speaker 7:  I would say. I think it's great that manufacturers are trying different designs.

238
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:24,405
Speaker 7:  Again, like the Fuji Film X Half is, is a good example of like a

239
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:28,085
Speaker 7:  really cute, really adorable design with some fun

240
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:31,565
Speaker 7:  features on it that harken back to the days of nostalgia. And I will admit

241
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:35,485
Speaker 7:  like a camera like that did make me feel nostalgic for like a couple days

242
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:39,365
Speaker 7:  and then After that it wore off and I'm like, this isn't really there. Right?

243
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:43,165
Speaker 7:  Like it's kind of just a basic point and shoot camera with this sort of

244
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:47,085
Speaker 7:  film experience. But I get it, if somebody hasn't had that, it would be super

245
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:50,405
Speaker 7:  fun to look at a contact sheet again, whatever. But I, it's, it's fun that

246
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:54,365
Speaker 7:  the manufacturers are taking these risks but how often do

247
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:57,445
Speaker 7:  they hit? Right? Because the Sigma BF is another example of something that

248
00:14:57,445 --> 00:15:01,165
Speaker 7:  was beautifully designed. Sigma always make weird cameras. They

249
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:04,565
Speaker 7:  always have. I've always thought they're kind of trash And I kind of thought

250
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:08,125
Speaker 7:  this last one was too, it's beautiful trash though. It's really gorgeous

251
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:09,245
Speaker 7:  trash. Oh no.

252
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:11,445
Speaker 2:  Beautiful trash. Okay. No ve has something to say.

253
00:15:11,505 --> 00:15:12,605
Speaker 8:  Say about this. We're back to disagree.

254
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:17,565
Speaker 8:  We can come back to the Fuji bud. Like I gotta, I gotta defend Sigma here.

255
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:21,805
Speaker 8:  Okay. Honestly, I, I, no, I think about this a lot. The camera that

256
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:25,725
Speaker 8:  I missed the most is the Sigma bf. Like the one that

257
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:29,565
Speaker 8:  I'm like, oh man, I wish I had like a little bit more time with it. I

258
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:33,365
Speaker 8:  really enjoyed using that camera. Wow. Like truly just loved

259
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:37,045
Speaker 8:  using it. It's like this unibody kind of unibody

260
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:41,925
Speaker 8:  metal slab of a camera. It is a Sigma

261
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:46,045
Speaker 8:  full frame camera that does some video that's not

262
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,725
Speaker 8:  really good at it. It has a built-in storage. Doesn't have any

263
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:53,525
Speaker 8:  card slots, it has a microphone but like you would've never use it.

264
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:58,085
Speaker 8:  It doesn't have a hot shoe. It can barely take photos in fluorescent

265
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:01,125
Speaker 8:  light because of the electric shutter. Only you're

266
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,325
Speaker 7:  Selling me on it. Yeah. This is not,

267
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:06,725
Speaker 8:  I know right. This is just like a list of cons and then

268
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:10,525
Speaker 8:  there is the, hey, I went to use this for a little while And I

269
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:13,765
Speaker 8:  absolutely loved it. Wow. I thought the lenses are pretty good and everything,

270
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:17,685
Speaker 8:  but I thought, you know, we live in a world where film simulations

271
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:21,365
Speaker 8:  are everywhere. Everyone's try Jelly kind of do it. I thought they did pretty

272
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:24,925
Speaker 8:  good with those. Yeah. But you know, I really enjoyed

273
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:29,325
Speaker 8:  how, okay, it has internal storage which makes the camera super fast. Like

274
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:33,205
Speaker 8:  turning it on, saving the photos. Operations in general just like feel

275
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:37,565
Speaker 8:  snappy. There's barely any dials on it. Right. You have one

276
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:41,325
Speaker 8:  main dial. Yeah. But in that dial it's also deep pad.

277
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:42,845
Speaker 8:  You can kind of like, that's

278
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:43,405
Speaker 7:  A real problem.

279
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:48,085
Speaker 8:  You can, you can set the like what you want to change on it left and right

280
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:52,325
Speaker 8:  and then use the click wheel basically to like change the settings

281
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:56,645
Speaker 8:  and it all shows on a little sub monitor. And it made me kind of

282
00:16:56,645 --> 00:17:00,445
Speaker 8:  cycle through, you know, two to three options that I would use

283
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:04,565
Speaker 8:  a lot. And I ended up using them a lot more like the film simulation and

284
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:08,325
Speaker 8:  crop primarily. And I thought the photos were actually

285
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:12,205
Speaker 8:  beautiful. I thought as we sure said earlier, the auto focus is like not

286
00:17:12,285 --> 00:17:15,125
Speaker 8:  a problem with these cameras anymore. And I thought they did a pretty good

287
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,285
Speaker 8:  job there as well. Yeah,

288
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:20,445
Speaker 7:  You said it right there though, Vern. The, the thing is it made you do stuff

289
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:24,085
Speaker 7:  because the Sigma BF is designed in such a way that you don't have

290
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,085
Speaker 7:  alternative ways to control a camera. And, and one of the things that really

291
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:31,885
Speaker 7:  drives me crazy as a photographer is if I have a camera or any product, I

292
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,765
Speaker 7:  mean even the iPad makes me mad for the same reason, nothing to do with photography

293
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:38,925
Speaker 7:  is if there are not multiple ways to control something, you know,

294
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:42,645
Speaker 7:  logical, intuitive ways. If you're kind of forced to use it a certain way,

295
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:46,565
Speaker 7:  I find that a little obnoxious. And like the BF has got this weird thing

296
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:49,485
Speaker 7:  'cause it's got a touch screen, but you only use the touch functions for

297
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:53,285
Speaker 7:  certain things otherwise you're back to using the dial. And it's

298
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:57,245
Speaker 7:  kind of, there's a lot of clicking to get through things I felt in stressful,

299
00:17:57,395 --> 00:18:01,165
Speaker 7:  like high-paced scenarios. It's too slow to adjust and get

300
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:04,925
Speaker 7:  set and get changed. The body's gorgeous. But that, that

301
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:08,805
Speaker 7:  block of aluminum, I mean they did such a great job machining it, but

302
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:12,245
Speaker 7:  those edges are so hard and sharp that, and I've been hearing now feedback

303
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:16,245
Speaker 7:  like people are bumping this camera onto things and chipping chunks off

304
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:19,925
Speaker 7:  those sharp edges. Like your gorgeous jewelry camera's not gonna look so

305
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,925
Speaker 7:  gorgeous after a while. You know, the, there's no EVF which I

306
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:27,725
Speaker 7:  is a huge strike for me. I know not people don't care but like

307
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:31,685
Speaker 7:  when I played with the Panasonic S nine, which is a compact little full frame

308
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:35,645
Speaker 7:  camera that also was limiting in a lot of ways. But

309
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:39,125
Speaker 7:  had that same idea, like functionality goes more towards color modes and

310
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,485
Speaker 7:  casual shooting and fun stuff. And then I played with the bf, I was like

311
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:46,485
Speaker 7:  gimme that S nine back as that thing actually is like a, that thing is a

312
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:50,445
Speaker 7:  professional monster compared to this. So I mean I get it as a,

313
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:53,725
Speaker 7:  as a beautiful camera that you wear in your shoulder that can take nice photos

314
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:57,845
Speaker 7:  and, and that can kind of be navigated once you learn it. Great. But

315
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:01,445
Speaker 7:  I would never like trust or rely on it to be like an everyday camera.

316
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:05,845
Speaker 7:  And I feel like Kato Yaki, the CEO just made it 'cause it looks so

317
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,645
Speaker 7:  beautiful and he is like, this is what I wanna carry around myself.

318
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:09,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

319
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:13,685
Speaker 8:  And truly it was my everyday carry. Right. Take photos

320
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:17,725
Speaker 8:  of stuff that I see around the street. I brought it to a press event, I think

321
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:21,685
Speaker 8:  it was a Google event, took one photo with And I was like, this is

322
00:19:21,705 --> 00:19:25,165
Speaker 8:  not, this is not it. Let's go this party. So it

323
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,325
Speaker 8:  definitely, this was like, I'm gonna carry it around and bring it places

324
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:32,165
Speaker 8:  and take pictures of what I see professional setting. Absolutely

325
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:33,125
Speaker 8:  not. Yeah. Yeah.

326
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:37,325
Speaker 2:  Jordan did you, was the like video just a non-starter for you and

327
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:39,685
Speaker 2:  the BF or like what are your BF feelings?

328
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:44,085
Speaker 6:  I, it basically they're, they're pretty similar to Chris's. Like it's not

329
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:47,965
Speaker 6:  a great video camera. The microphone thing came up, which is

330
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:51,725
Speaker 6:  super weird on it. Yeah. To like have Bluetooth support, which I could never

331
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:55,325
Speaker 6:  get to work anyways. Oh no, there's no IBUs and the rolling shutter on it's

332
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:59,085
Speaker 6:  really bad. So again, it's those wibbly wobbly situations on it and I'm

333
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:02,725
Speaker 6:  terrified of it the whole time I'm holding it. I'm like, what is, what if

334
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:06,365
Speaker 6:  I accidentally put it down thero the wrong way and cut my stomach over? Like

335
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:10,405
Speaker 6:  it's, there were people who put it in their jacket pockets

336
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:14,125
Speaker 6:  and they like shredded the inside lining of their jacket pockets.

337
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:18,365
Speaker 6:  The one attribute it has is whenever I'm doing anything

338
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,805
Speaker 6:  on my own time, I have a camera with me. 'cause we're always testing stuff

339
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:25,925
Speaker 6:  and everyone ignores me. But this time, the one time

340
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:29,805
Speaker 6:  I went out with the bf I had like a half dozen people walk up and

341
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:33,365
Speaker 6:  just be like, that is cool. What is that? Is that, yeah. Yeah. So

342
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:36,885
Speaker 6:  that's the appeal of it. If you wanna meet people and don't like joining

343
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:40,925
Speaker 6:  clubs, like the BF is a small investment to make new friends

344
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:44,805
Speaker 6:  but as a photographic tool, I just found it. Yeah.

345
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:46,165
Speaker 6:  Very difficult.

346
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:49,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It is an unapologetic camera

347
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:52,725
Speaker 7:  that owes everybody an apology

348
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:55,925
Speaker 2:  For hurting them physically it sounds like

349
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:57,565
Speaker 7:  For all sorts of stuff.

350
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:02,805
Speaker 2:  Okay. So on the like also unapologetic, but with a different

351
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:06,765
Speaker 2:  like ethos I think, you know, you brought up the Fuji film

352
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:10,565
Speaker 2:  half, I'll be honest. I think it's adorable and fun

353
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:14,725
Speaker 2:  and adorable And I wanna carry it around also not,

354
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:19,045
Speaker 2:  I don't want it to be the camera I have every single day

355
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:23,165
Speaker 2:  and look back at photos of my kid in 10 years and be like, yes,

356
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,885
Speaker 2:  sorry sun. These are all like crappy

357
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:29,525
Speaker 2:  like film stock simulations.

358
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:34,925
Speaker 2:  So yeah. Chris, what's your take on the Fuji?

359
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:38,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah, like look, I, you know, I know I kind of sound like no fun nickels

360
00:21:38,485 --> 00:21:42,445
Speaker 7:  all the time, but I've actually come around a lot on film

361
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:46,045
Speaker 7:  simulation modes of all sorts, right? Like, you know, Lumix Lab, Panasonic

362
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:49,605
Speaker 7:  did that with Lumix lab and Fujifilm's always done it and, and now

363
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:52,845
Speaker 7:  Sigma's doing like all the companies are kind of building up on this, make

364
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:56,405
Speaker 7:  your own preset kind of business. Do your own customizations, make a vintage

365
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:59,725
Speaker 7:  aesthetic, make a warm tone, you know, anything you wanna do. And I think

366
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:03,205
Speaker 7:  that's great. And, and actually on the X half I really enjoyed all the silly

367
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:06,765
Speaker 7:  stuff like the light leaks and you know, all these, all these kind of features

368
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:10,605
Speaker 7:  that it had. So you've got this tiny little camera with like a cropped

369
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:14,165
Speaker 7:  sensor down from micro four third size ish, you know, image

370
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:18,045
Speaker 7:  quality's fine. It's, it's fine. But it's, it's basic. And, and it's

371
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,045
Speaker 7:  this, it's this cute little, I mean it's, the design is beautiful.

372
00:22:22,065 --> 00:22:25,605
Speaker 7:  It works in basically two modes. It's like two cameras at one. So first mode

373
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:29,485
Speaker 7:  is you have a very basic point and shoot digital camera, but you

374
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:33,445
Speaker 7:  can do film simulations, you can play around with some of this stuff. The

375
00:22:33,445 --> 00:22:36,765
Speaker 7:  second mode is where it really kind of tries to draw a nostalgic, give you

376
00:22:36,805 --> 00:22:40,725
Speaker 7:  a film shooting experience. So it shoots in a vertical format. I think we

377
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:43,565
Speaker 7:  should mention that, which is kind of cool right off the bat. Not that it

378
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:47,485
Speaker 7:  needs to, that's just what it does. Which is adorable. And, and the camera

379
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:51,605
Speaker 7:  has a thumb winder on it. So you can go into a film mode. You

380
00:22:51,605 --> 00:22:55,045
Speaker 7:  choose a roll of film, like basically a Fuji film simulation. You choose

381
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:58,925
Speaker 7:  it and you're stuck with it For the next however many shots you're gonna

382
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:01,885
Speaker 7:  do, you can choose 24, 36, like

383
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:05,325
Speaker 7:  48, 72. And then at the end of doing that, it

384
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:09,485
Speaker 7:  develops that role of film. Oh my gosh. It gives you a contact sheet with

385
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:13,245
Speaker 7:  your negatives all laid out like that. Right. As a positive image.

386
00:23:13,665 --> 00:23:17,285
Speaker 7:  And it's cute and it's fun And I get it. And you're using the thumb

387
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:20,885
Speaker 7:  winder in between every shot. It won't let you shoot unless you crank the

388
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:22,565
Speaker 7:  thumb winder in this second mode.

389
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:23,485
Speaker 2:  Oh my God.

390
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:27,765
Speaker 7:  But the thumb winder doesn't always register. If you go too fast

391
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:30,405
Speaker 7:  with that camera, you're, you're, do you have to like I started treating

392
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:33,325
Speaker 7:  it like an M three double wind. I'm like, I'm double winding this thing every

393
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:37,085
Speaker 7:  time just to make sure and like the novelty. I think

394
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:40,525
Speaker 7:  it's a super fun thing to do. And then after like, I don't know what your,

395
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:44,125
Speaker 7:  what your threshold will be, but after like three or four fake roles of film,

396
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:47,325
Speaker 7:  I'd just be like, forget it. I'm going back to the regular camera. 'cause

397
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,485
Speaker 7:  I wanna be able to have the option to just change things afterwards and not

398
00:23:50,485 --> 00:23:54,445
Speaker 7:  have to, you know, go and go through 36 shots in black and white. When

399
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:57,845
Speaker 7:  I desperately see something I wanna shoot color. So I found myself just saying,

400
00:23:57,845 --> 00:24:00,765
Speaker 7:  you know what? And the thumb winder was kind of silly and superfluous. So

401
00:24:00,935 --> 00:24:04,845
Speaker 7:  after a while I was like, I just use this as a basic point and shoot camera.

402
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:08,645
Speaker 7:  But then why did I pay for that whole film and thumb wonder situation? I

403
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:12,085
Speaker 7:  mean, I don't know. That's, that's my feeling on it. I'm no fun. It's a gorgeous

404
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:14,285
Speaker 7:  camera. It's like gorgeously desired.

405
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:17,205
Speaker 2:  What is the price tag on it? We should say that out loud.

406
00:24:17,795 --> 00:24:18,725
Speaker 7:  Like 800 bucks.

407
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:19,685
Speaker 8:  800

408
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:23,645
Speaker 6:  Us. Yeah. It's, I thought we were really surprised. The one thing

409
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:27,445
Speaker 6:  I will say about it is Chris may not have enjoyed doing like the

410
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:31,485
Speaker 6:  film mode thing, but as an outside spectator, 'cause I

411
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:34,525
Speaker 6:  didn't shoot photos on it. I had the terrible experience of shooting some

412
00:24:34,525 --> 00:24:37,525
Speaker 6:  video on it, which I can briefly address. But,

413
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:42,405
Speaker 6:  but it looked like the whole time I'm like, that looks like fun. I wanna

414
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:46,325
Speaker 6:  do that. I wanna go take the half. Yeah. So there, there might be some appeal

415
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:49,245
Speaker 6:  there. I want to actually try it out, shoot some photos, see if I do enjoy

416
00:24:49,245 --> 00:24:52,805
Speaker 6:  that. But like Chris mentioned, you know, the image quality's decent,

417
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:56,165
Speaker 6:  it's smartphone decent, you know. Yeah. It's, it's like a type one sense

418
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:59,325
Speaker 6:  or what the slow lens. So your smartphone will do the same quality. Yeah.

419
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:02,645
Speaker 6:  But the video was hilarious because they have light leak effects, which,

420
00:25:02,665 --> 00:25:06,485
Speaker 6:  you know, in photo just sit in one static place. But in

421
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:09,925
Speaker 6:  video, if you've got a leak it'll move based on where the light is coming

422
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,525
Speaker 6:  from. But this doesn't do this, so it looks like you just put like a piece

423
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:17,285
Speaker 6:  of glass in front of the lens and painted like an orange smear on it

424
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:20,885
Speaker 6:  and then it's just stuck in front as you wave the camera around. It looks

425
00:25:20,885 --> 00:25:24,205
Speaker 6:  hilarious. Yeah. It's like early David Lynch when he was figuring out digital

426
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:27,365
Speaker 6:  cameras. But it's as weird as hell ruins

427
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:30,365
Speaker 2:  The, the illusion a little bit. Yeah. So

428
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:34,725
Speaker 2:  bien, you wrote the review for us and which seemed

429
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:39,085
Speaker 2:  very positive. Is this another like Sigma BF situation for

430
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:42,525
Speaker 2:  you where you're like, yes, it's limited, but I love what it

431
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:45,645
Speaker 7:  Is. I think he's a masochist. I I think that's what it's, I think you're

432
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:46,685
Speaker 7:  just a masochist. I

433
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:50,605
Speaker 8:  I'm, I'm just thinking optimist. No, I i i it was mostly

434
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:57,265
Speaker 8:  but so hard to justify. Right. We, we already talked about the price. Yeah.

435
00:25:57,265 --> 00:26:00,865
Speaker 8:  The price is just ridiculous. If you look at the comments on any of the videos

436
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:04,425
Speaker 8:  or, or articles, everyone is like, thi this is insane.

437
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:08,745
Speaker 8:  What I did enjoy about it was actually using it

438
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:13,305
Speaker 8:  until you hit the, what was also mentioned. It feels slow.

439
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:17,665
Speaker 8:  You know when you take a photo and you crank it and it doesn't

440
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:18,105
Speaker 8:  register.

441
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:20,105
Speaker 7:  You found that too? Yeah. Oh

442
00:26:20,105 --> 00:26:23,985
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It was very slow to like write onto the card And I had a fast card

443
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:27,305
Speaker 8:  in it. The processor in it is actually like really good. It shouldn't be

444
00:26:27,305 --> 00:26:30,905
Speaker 8:  the case that it's so slow. Those are the things that like

445
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:34,345
Speaker 8:  bother me. What I did like about it's is that it felt like

446
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:39,115
Speaker 8:  some thought went into oh a hundred percent designing the hardware

447
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:42,675
Speaker 8:  and software int them for the experience of using it.

448
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:47,045
Speaker 8:  It didn't feel like, you know, hey here's a trend, we're gonna make

449
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:50,365
Speaker 8:  something really quickly. It like, you know, at these press events, they

450
00:26:50,365 --> 00:26:53,645
Speaker 8:  give you the r and d story behind it And I was like, you know what, yeah

451
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:57,165
Speaker 8:  I can kind of buy it. I don't think it's quite just a cash grab, although

452
00:26:57,165 --> 00:27:01,125
Speaker 8:  the price is ridiculous. So using it was fun. I did not try the video

453
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:05,205
Speaker 8:  with light leaks. Oh, you can if you got some time this

454
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:09,045
Speaker 8:  weekend. Enjoy. I'm good. No, no, no. This was, and

455
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,965
Speaker 8:  just for reference, like it wasn't a review, it was like a hands-on. I had

456
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:15,845
Speaker 8:  like a couple of hours with it. Oh yeah. So it was just like a pretty brief

457
00:27:15,975 --> 00:27:19,725
Speaker 8:  experience with it and yeah, I think software hardware design

458
00:27:20,065 --> 00:27:23,765
Speaker 8:  was interesting. Fun. It was fun to use, but it is

459
00:27:23,995 --> 00:27:27,365
Speaker 8:  like, I would never buy because of the price. Even if I do buy it,

460
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:31,845
Speaker 8:  I am a little bit sucker for like high quality, beautiful, high megapixel,

461
00:27:31,845 --> 00:27:34,645
Speaker 8:  everything. Sure. I don't think I would actually take it out as much. You

462
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:38,525
Speaker 8:  know, I, it would probably be the camera that I leave behind. I use

463
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:42,485
Speaker 8:  a lot more of like, you know, the pocket, the, the Osmo pockets and

464
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:46,125
Speaker 8:  one of these cameras. And I just want to cover every base.

465
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:50,245
Speaker 8:  The base that I don't want to cover is fun.

466
00:27:51,555 --> 00:27:53,255
Speaker 8:  One inch sensor. Oh

467
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:53,855
Speaker 2:  Aura.

468
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:55,095
Speaker 8:  That's just extra.

469
00:27:56,115 --> 00:28:00,015
Speaker 2:  You mentioned the Osmo And I have questions

470
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:04,335
Speaker 2:  actually I noticed this like I, this

471
00:28:04,335 --> 00:28:08,215
Speaker 2:  was starting to ramp up when I was leaving deep review, but like

472
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:11,695
Speaker 2:  every camera company launching their like vlogger camera

473
00:28:12,835 --> 00:28:16,735
Speaker 2:  and I got kind of a, a glimpse of, of

474
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:20,655
Speaker 2:  this I reported a little bit ago on, on the Cannon power shot

475
00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:24,535
Speaker 2:  GX seven three. Right. The three. Oh

476
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:24,815
Speaker 7:  Lucky.

477
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:29,015
Speaker 2:  Have these like vlogging focused cameras panned out for the

478
00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:32,135
Speaker 2:  manufacturers or did like the Osmo just win the

479
00:28:32,135 --> 00:28:32,575
Speaker 8:  Osmo killed

480
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:36,095
Speaker 7:  Them all. That's funny. Yeah. The Osmo killed them all. I was thinking about

481
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:40,055
Speaker 7:  this though, just today. Like all these companies that we were going through

482
00:28:40,055 --> 00:28:43,815
Speaker 7:  started making vlogging cameras. Right. Panasonic did. Nikon did. Sony of

483
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:46,775
Speaker 7:  course really came outta the gate first. Canon then started to, and it was

484
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:50,455
Speaker 7:  like no camera viewer that I really knew of. Super enjoyed these cameras,

485
00:28:50,505 --> 00:28:53,655
Speaker 7:  right? We're all complaining about the same things. It's like, oh they're

486
00:28:53,655 --> 00:28:56,815
Speaker 7:  expensive and like they're kind of silly And I don't know who wants these.

487
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,055
Speaker 7:  And I'm convinced it's 'cause there's so many people that do so many other

488
00:29:00,295 --> 00:29:03,975
Speaker 7:  interests that we're just not interested in that are looking for a very basic

489
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:07,535
Speaker 7:  kit to get started. I guess if I was somebody starting out And I didn't know

490
00:29:07,535 --> 00:29:10,895
Speaker 7:  what I was doing, I just wanted to like get something at Best Buy, put it

491
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:14,375
Speaker 7:  in front of me and make it work well then that might do it. Right. So

492
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:18,735
Speaker 7:  I I, I think that's why they were so popular. But I think now as more people

493
00:29:18,735 --> 00:29:22,095
Speaker 7:  catch onto the Osmo, the beauty of a gimbal, the fact that again, it's very

494
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,415
Speaker 7:  simple. The fact that you can add microphones to it, like seamlessly,

495
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:29,575
Speaker 7:  that makes it even more convenient. And I think is more and more people figure

496
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:33,455
Speaker 7:  out what the pocket cameras do for them. We're gonna see even less and less

497
00:29:33,455 --> 00:29:33,975
Speaker 7:  flog cameras.

498
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:38,175
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. Have those been hard to get like the drones?

499
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:42,645
Speaker 8:  It's not hard to get except the price has gone up. Yes.

500
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:46,685
Speaker 8:  By 40%. I think it's about 900 bucks to like get the whole thing and it started

501
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:47,245
Speaker 8:  with 500.

502
00:29:48,715 --> 00:29:52,605
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I mean even at $900 it's still probably worth it.

503
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:56,965
Speaker 7:  But yeah, like when they were $500, what a steal. Yeah. What a great little

504
00:29:56,965 --> 00:30:00,885
Speaker 7:  camera. And yeah, image quality as we've talked about is plateaued.

505
00:30:00,885 --> 00:30:04,605
Speaker 7:  Nobody cares anymore. We want it to work and we want it to be easy and we

506
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:08,245
Speaker 7:  want to know that when we get home everything's okay and it's all set for

507
00:30:08,245 --> 00:30:09,685
Speaker 7:  us. Like yeah, it's great.

508
00:30:10,195 --> 00:30:14,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well on the subject of making YouTube videos,

509
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,925
Speaker 2:  I have questions for the two of you, Chris and Jordan.

510
00:30:18,945 --> 00:30:22,045
Speaker 2:  You guys have been at this for so long and

511
00:30:22,825 --> 00:30:26,725
Speaker 2:  I'm curious on your perspective on how it's changed. You know, like

512
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:30,365
Speaker 2:  there's just a lot in that question. There's like the camera market has changed,

513
00:30:30,505 --> 00:30:33,965
Speaker 2:  the technology has changed, like making the videos has changed but

514
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:38,485
Speaker 2:  I don't know how, how do you look at, at the change over the past

515
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:40,605
Speaker 2:  like decade that you've been doing this?

516
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:45,445
Speaker 7:  The style that younger creators make now is very different. We still stick

517
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:49,405
Speaker 7:  to our same style. We shoot a lot on location and as you can,

518
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:52,605
Speaker 7:  as you said Jordan with like nicer cameras, you know, Jordan's looking for

519
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:56,525
Speaker 7:  more cinematic results and control over depth of field. And so

520
00:30:56,595 --> 00:31:00,525
Speaker 7:  whereas now I think a lot of young creators are looking more at presets and

521
00:31:00,955 --> 00:31:04,405
Speaker 7:  more extreme color grades and faster cuts and stuff. But what do you think

522
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:04,605
Speaker 7:  Jordan?

523
00:31:05,305 --> 00:31:09,125
Speaker 6:  And I think the big difference is when we started it just had to be passable.

524
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:13,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And you could build a massive audience. Like basically our early stuff.

525
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:14,445
Speaker 6:  Is unwatchably bad?

526
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:15,365
Speaker 7:  No it's not.

527
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:18,685
Speaker 6:  But fairly quickly we got to a level where, yeah it was

528
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:22,405
Speaker 6:  better than, you know, something that someone with no background in video

529
00:31:22,405 --> 00:31:26,245
Speaker 6:  production could put together. Where now you know, the bar is so

530
00:31:26,245 --> 00:31:30,085
Speaker 6:  much higher if you're starting. But I think it almost puts us in an interesting

531
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:33,445
Speaker 6:  place 'cause it's not so much about like how is your production value, but

532
00:31:33,445 --> 00:31:37,325
Speaker 6:  it's like what are you producing? And if that's compelling. Like I think

533
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:40,645
Speaker 6:  if you're like for us specifically, hey if you wanna review camera gear,

534
00:31:40,985 --> 00:31:44,725
Speaker 6:  you know, you better back it up with some interesting photos or interesting

535
00:31:44,725 --> 00:31:48,565
Speaker 6:  shoots or an interesting experience or something like that. Pure brute

536
00:31:48,565 --> 00:31:52,485
Speaker 6:  technical knowhow is not gonna get you as far as it used to back in the

537
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:56,405
Speaker 6:  day. So, you know, we learned very quickly to just start injecting more

538
00:31:56,405 --> 00:31:59,925
Speaker 6:  of our personalities into the video. And that's I think why we're still doing

539
00:31:59,925 --> 00:32:03,765
Speaker 6:  this all that time later. Yeah, the tools have definitely, like editing is

540
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:07,245
Speaker 6:  faster now on location. They've given us a lot of stuff, you know, more dynamic

541
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:11,045
Speaker 6:  range in a camera means I can shoot in more locations without looking

542
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:14,445
Speaker 6:  for a place with easier light to work with. So all of that is just making

543
00:32:14,505 --> 00:32:18,005
Speaker 6:  us more productive and that's what I, I love to see. Yeah. Is just like,

544
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:19,965
Speaker 6:  hey we can, we can actually do more now. Yeah.

545
00:32:20,075 --> 00:32:21,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Does that resonate V

546
00:32:22,555 --> 00:32:25,685
Speaker 8:  Yeah. But I actually wanted to ask a question. I feel like in the last couple

547
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:29,365
Speaker 8:  of years especially, you know, would, would the rise of short form video

548
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:33,165
Speaker 8:  content, especially when it comes to camera, every

549
00:32:33,165 --> 00:32:37,085
Speaker 8:  release of a camera, everyone has a video about it. Everyone has

550
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:40,925
Speaker 8:  something ready to go on embargo. Right? It's more saturated than

551
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:44,885
Speaker 8:  ever honestly. And you know, we've seen reports of just like influencer marketing

552
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:48,245
Speaker 8:  budgets are like, you know, over roofing everything. Yeah. Right.

553
00:32:48,905 --> 00:32:52,685
Speaker 8:  Is there anything else that you kind of do or think differently to stand

554
00:32:52,685 --> 00:32:54,365
Speaker 8:  out to remain yourself?

555
00:32:54,695 --> 00:32:58,525
Speaker 7:  We've always tried to do a lot of the videos that we reviews that we do with

556
00:32:58,525 --> 00:33:02,485
Speaker 7:  the cameras that we have. Right. And we try to do them on location. So we're

557
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:05,765
Speaker 7:  not really in the office talking, we're out shooting on location because

558
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:09,205
Speaker 7:  we wanna give the viewers the idea like look this is how we're using the

559
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:12,965
Speaker 7:  camera. This is how you might use the camera Weather. Ceiling might be a

560
00:33:12,965 --> 00:33:15,445
Speaker 7:  factor. You know, where you're actually gonna be out there and you know,

561
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:19,245
Speaker 7:  things like that. Auto focus, all these kind of things. And you see though,

562
00:33:19,285 --> 00:33:21,765
Speaker 7:  I think a lot of creators are making really good stuff, but they're showing

563
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:25,485
Speaker 7:  a lot more of the end result of that video camera for example.

564
00:33:25,665 --> 00:33:29,525
Speaker 7:  Or photographic camera, you know, after editing, after compiling it together.

565
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:33,285
Speaker 7:  And they're often shooting themselves speaking about it with different camera

566
00:33:33,395 --> 00:33:36,725
Speaker 7:  gear. 'cause it's more convenient and it's quicker and it's easier if you're

567
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:40,485
Speaker 7:  just one person. Whereas we have the benefit of the, of the two of us.

568
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,565
Speaker 7:  So, but yeah, it's, it's just a different dynamic hence Jordan's shirt and,

569
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:48,205
Speaker 7:  and we've always tried to do that like beyond location using the cameras

570
00:33:48,345 --> 00:33:52,285
Speaker 7:  as real world as we can. Not only for the photography but also for

571
00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:54,365
Speaker 7:  the video. Yeah. Yeah. That one right there. Yeah.

572
00:33:54,715 --> 00:33:57,085
Speaker 2:  Film on location, you cowards. I love it.

573
00:33:57,325 --> 00:33:58,565
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That's where that comes from. Yeah.

574
00:33:59,675 --> 00:34:03,165
Speaker 2:  Alright, well thank you all three of you for joining me. And

575
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:07,365
Speaker 2:  I'm sure we're all gonna be together. IRL, you know. Yes. Soon enough

576
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:09,925
Speaker 2:  in the fall one way or another. So thank you.

577
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:11,925
Speaker 7:  That season's coming up. Yeah,

578
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:15,765
Speaker 2:  Thanks guys. We've gotta take another break and After that

579
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:18,405
Speaker 2:  we're doing a mega hotline. Stay tuned.

580
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:42,815
Speaker 11:  I, you know, been doing a little work on my, my European phone market so

581
00:37:42,815 --> 00:37:44,135
Speaker 11:  I can onto some of that side of things hopefully.

582
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:48,775
Speaker 2:  Yes please. Because the xmi

583
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:51,375
Speaker 2:  of the world are a mystery to me so

584
00:37:52,585 --> 00:37:56,095
Speaker 2:  Great. Okay, so our first question

585
00:37:56,485 --> 00:38:00,295
Speaker 2:  came from Brendan and he called

586
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:02,015
Speaker 2:  in so we can go ahead and listen to it.

587
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:07,615
Speaker 12:  Hi, this is Brendan from Rochester, New York. I have a pixel

588
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:11,735
Speaker 12:  six that is starting to get a little slow and nearing its end of you know,

589
00:38:12,055 --> 00:38:15,495
Speaker 12:  guaranteed security updates next year. And so I was looking to buy a new

590
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:19,375
Speaker 12:  phone. I want something that's going to last for a while

591
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:23,135
Speaker 12:  and have OS updates and security updates, but I also want

592
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:27,095
Speaker 12:  something that's kind of on the smaller side. The pixel six is kind of heavy

593
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:30,895
Speaker 12:  and and big. So I was tempted by, you know, phones

594
00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:34,495
Speaker 12:  like the asis Xfo nine.

595
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:38,725
Speaker 12:  I want something that's kind of around that size, which I know it's really

596
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:42,685
Speaker 12:  hard to find. So if you had any suggestions that would be great. Thanks.

597
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:47,625
Speaker 2:  I am so sorry Brendan, but we have nothing but

598
00:38:47,685 --> 00:38:48,465
Speaker 2:  bad news for you.

599
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:52,265
Speaker 11:  My heart broke a little bit, especially that mention of the Zen phone nine

600
00:38:52,335 --> 00:38:53,985
Speaker 11:  like I know I missed that one.

601
00:38:54,575 --> 00:38:58,425
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I know. So the quick answer I think is

602
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:03,065
Speaker 2:  you're probably gonna want a Samsung Galaxy S 25 that is

603
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:06,865
Speaker 2:  the last smallish phone that is like,

604
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:11,025
Speaker 2:  you know, widely available in the US The Azu Zen phone kind

605
00:39:11,025 --> 00:39:14,905
Speaker 2:  of went away. They like only make a big version now

606
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:19,505
Speaker 2:  And I don't think they even sell it in the us Are there options in the UK

607
00:39:19,615 --> 00:39:21,065
Speaker 2:  that we just don't get here

608
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:26,145
Speaker 11:  Weirdly? No, this is one area we're still even the rest of Europe and

609
00:39:26,145 --> 00:39:28,705
Speaker 11:  even if you look at China there's, there's not really a big difference other

610
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:32,385
Speaker 11:  than going into really tiny oddball things like the, the

611
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:36,385
Speaker 11:  Uni hertz Jelly Star, which is this minuscule phone with a minuscule screen

612
00:39:36,735 --> 00:39:40,505
Speaker 11:  kind of that zen phone nine esque

613
00:39:40,505 --> 00:39:44,345
Speaker 11:  form factor has pretty much gone. The S 25 is probably the best

614
00:39:44,405 --> 00:39:46,865
Speaker 11:  bet. The, the kind of, the big one you might get in the rest of the world

615
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:50,785
Speaker 11:  is the Xmi 15. But that's basically the same size

616
00:39:50,785 --> 00:39:54,425
Speaker 11:  as like a pixel nine, pixel 10. It's still a little bit bigger than an S

617
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:58,225
Speaker 11:  25. So if the main priority is size, the the S 25

618
00:39:58,225 --> 00:39:58,905
Speaker 11:  is gonna be the best.

619
00:39:59,615 --> 00:40:02,465
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So we've failed Brendan, I'm sorry

620
00:40:03,685 --> 00:40:07,145
Speaker 2:  but we yeah S 20 five's probably gonna be it

621
00:40:07,525 --> 00:40:09,305
Speaker 2:  and our our hearts are with you.

622
00:40:10,255 --> 00:40:13,225
Speaker 11:  Yeah. We have this perverse thing now where like even if you look at the

623
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:16,025
Speaker 11:  Chinese brands and what they're putting out even within China, not the stuff

624
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:19,505
Speaker 11:  that comes to Europe, we're seeing phones that are branded like mini or

625
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:22,905
Speaker 11:  compact and they're still 6.4 inch displays

626
00:40:23,325 --> 00:40:26,945
Speaker 11:  and you know, they're bigger than an S 25, way bigger than an iPhone many

627
00:40:26,945 --> 00:40:28,905
Speaker 11:  ever was. It's, it's kind of strange.

628
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:33,145
Speaker 2:  Yeah the phone beginning has happened and

629
00:40:33,215 --> 00:40:37,145
Speaker 2:  it's, it's not gonna let up I think. So the next

630
00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:40,305
Speaker 2:  question we have and we got this kind of a lot

631
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,025
Speaker 2:  is from Nate.

632
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:48,785
Speaker 13:  Hey there, this is Nate. I've been an apple like iPhone

633
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:52,585
Speaker 13:  user and Mac user forever. I'm definitely in

634
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:56,465
Speaker 13:  the the walled garden of Apple. Like I have the

635
00:40:56,645 --> 00:41:00,065
Speaker 13:  AirPod Pro Apple watch and I'm just getting a little bored

636
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:05,225
Speaker 13:  and I'm curious what the other side is like And I

637
00:41:05,225 --> 00:41:08,945
Speaker 13:  don't really know, you know with the Android phones

638
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:13,185
Speaker 13:  and even the watches and the headphones is there that

639
00:41:13,185 --> 00:41:17,145
Speaker 13:  much of a difference? It'd be nice if they were similar but yeah, that's

640
00:41:17,145 --> 00:41:18,065
Speaker 13:  my question. Thanks.

641
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:22,825
Speaker 2:  So this was kind of a theme, people being bored with their

642
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:26,345
Speaker 2:  phones And I don't know if I'm just being a bummer

643
00:41:26,645 --> 00:41:30,185
Speaker 2:  but I kind of think that's 'cause phones are boring now.

644
00:41:30,805 --> 00:41:32,305
Speaker 2:  What's your read on this Tom?

645
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:36,845
Speaker 11:  I think if boredom is the, the motivator, there are basically only two ways

646
00:41:36,865 --> 00:41:40,765
Speaker 11:  you can go, which is buy a foldable which are maybe

647
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:44,085
Speaker 11:  a little bit more interesting if you are, if you're not already on one or

648
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:48,245
Speaker 11:  buy something from nothing, which is still ultimately just a phone

649
00:41:48,665 --> 00:41:51,645
Speaker 11:  but at least it's gonna look kind of fun before you put your case on it

650
00:41:52,005 --> 00:41:55,605
Speaker 2:  Before. Yeah, something from nothing Took me a second but yes,

651
00:41:56,005 --> 00:41:59,765
Speaker 2:  yes. The, the phone brand, nothing. I'm kind of

652
00:41:59,765 --> 00:42:03,485
Speaker 2:  thinking of your traditional like pixels and galaxies

653
00:42:03,865 --> 00:42:07,805
Speaker 2:  and there are things here and there that are a little different. There's

654
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:11,765
Speaker 2:  definitely more AI features throughout

655
00:42:11,785 --> 00:42:15,645
Speaker 2:  the os if that's something that interests you. I

656
00:42:15,735 --> 00:42:19,565
Speaker 2:  don't think a lot of people are motivated by AI at this point.

657
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:23,965
Speaker 2:  But yeah, I think a foldable is that's really the, the

658
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:27,645
Speaker 2:  best you can do as far as like it's going to feel different

659
00:42:27,785 --> 00:42:29,365
Speaker 2:  and you're going to use it differently.

660
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:33,685
Speaker 11:  That changes your experience with the phone, whichever foldable form factor

661
00:42:33,685 --> 00:42:37,485
Speaker 11:  you go for, whether you're talking like a flip phone which kind of can

662
00:42:37,505 --> 00:42:40,245
Speaker 11:  reduce your screen time, you can leave the phone closed and engage with

663
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:42,805
Speaker 11:  it a bit less or obviously the book style gets you more of that, you know,

664
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:46,045
Speaker 11:  tablet that fits in your pocket kind of thing. Either way there Aren there

665
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:49,925
Speaker 11:  are different, different way of of having a phone. I mean the

666
00:42:49,925 --> 00:42:52,765
Speaker 11:  other thing I'd say to that question with the kind of the broader, what

667
00:42:52,765 --> 00:42:56,485
Speaker 11:  is there on the Android side side of that, that question from Nate.

668
00:42:57,185 --> 00:43:00,165
Speaker 11:  One big difference that this is definitely a, a rest of the world thing

669
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:03,365
Speaker 11:  I'm afraid not the US thing but there is this whole kind of space where

670
00:43:03,365 --> 00:43:06,925
Speaker 11:  cameras in the flagship Android devices

671
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:11,685
Speaker 11:  from the big Chinese OEMs like, like OMI and honor and Oppo

672
00:43:12,065 --> 00:43:15,925
Speaker 11:  and Vivo, those cameras are and are really, really wild and

673
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:19,445
Speaker 11:  they are nothing like you're gonna find on any iPhone right now. Both in

674
00:43:19,445 --> 00:43:23,125
Speaker 11:  terms of the design, these are like very big almost D-S-L-R-S camera rings

675
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:26,885
Speaker 11:  that dominate devices and make them very top heavy. But you know, amazing

676
00:43:26,995 --> 00:43:30,805
Speaker 11:  telephoto lenses, really big sensors, really great depth of

677
00:43:30,805 --> 00:43:34,685
Speaker 11:  field from shots and kind of a lot more processing options as well sometimes.

678
00:43:35,105 --> 00:43:38,205
Speaker 11:  That's one thing I think that the Android side has that just there isn't

679
00:43:38,205 --> 00:43:41,685
Speaker 11:  an option on the iPhone. The frustrating bit of that is then there's no

680
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,965
Speaker 11:  option for that in the US 'cause I think what Samsung and Google are doing

681
00:43:45,145 --> 00:43:48,365
Speaker 11:  is much more in line with what Apple are doing, which is kind of, yeah more

682
00:43:48,365 --> 00:43:51,725
Speaker 11:  modest camera bumps and very impressive cameras but not really

683
00:43:51,855 --> 00:43:53,525
Speaker 11:  completely pushing the boat out there.

684
00:43:54,235 --> 00:43:57,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah the, I feel like there's other companies in the world that have been

685
00:43:57,845 --> 00:44:01,605
Speaker 2:  like what if hardware and yeah

686
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:05,645
Speaker 2:  the Samsung and Pixel phones are kind of like we've

687
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:09,405
Speaker 2:  locked in on the hardware and we're just optimizing the shit out of everything

688
00:44:09,645 --> 00:44:12,805
Speaker 2:  with software. So that's kind of where we are.

689
00:44:13,805 --> 00:44:16,925
Speaker 2:  I will say some of those, is it a phone? Is it a camera

690
00:44:17,385 --> 00:44:21,285
Speaker 2:  Phones are so much fun to use and I'm extremely jealous

691
00:44:21,355 --> 00:44:23,045
Speaker 2:  that you get to do that more than I do.

692
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:26,125
Speaker 11:  Oh they're great fun. But I mean I think there's definitely like there's

693
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:28,725
Speaker 11:  a big aesthetic trade off as well, which I think is part of the reason the

694
00:44:28,725 --> 00:44:32,645
Speaker 11:  big US players haven't opted for it. 'cause you're already basically saying

695
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:37,205
Speaker 11:  I'm willing for my phone to look quite a lot uglier in the name

696
00:44:37,345 --> 00:44:40,845
Speaker 11:  of having a way better camera experience. And I don't know that that's the

697
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:44,805
Speaker 11:  mainstream US or or European phone buyer, right. Most people

698
00:44:44,805 --> 00:44:47,325
Speaker 11:  are not willing to make that swap. They want a really good camera but they

699
00:44:47,325 --> 00:44:50,645
Speaker 11:  still want their phone to look like a normal attractive phone.

700
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:55,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah, you gotta choose, you gotta make your choices and the

701
00:44:55,465 --> 00:44:59,405
Speaker 2:  US manufacturers have made that choice for us. So our next

702
00:44:59,645 --> 00:45:03,445
Speaker 2:  question is kind of relates because Brian wants to know about

703
00:45:03,475 --> 00:45:05,325
Speaker 2:  Foldables so we can listen to that one.

704
00:45:07,065 --> 00:45:10,845
Speaker 14:  Hi Allison. My name's Ryan. My thing that I

705
00:45:10,905 --> 00:45:14,725
Speaker 14:  run into a lot with phones, at least for the last

706
00:45:14,725 --> 00:45:17,845
Speaker 14:  year or so and what will be the next year is battery life.

707
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:22,525
Speaker 14:  And I am really contemplating some of the folding phones

708
00:45:22,525 --> 00:45:25,885
Speaker 14:  that are out there on the market right now. Obviously

709
00:45:26,275 --> 00:45:29,845
Speaker 14:  what will be the Pixel Pro 10

710
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:34,045
Speaker 14:  fold is really appealing. But I

711
00:45:34,045 --> 00:45:37,565
Speaker 14:  don't know, just based on what I've seen, if battery life on any

712
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:40,765
Speaker 14:  foldable right now is that great. So

713
00:45:41,525 --> 00:45:45,045
Speaker 14:  I guess like battery life inside of foldables or do I just

714
00:45:45,255 --> 00:45:49,005
Speaker 14:  stick to my good old candy bar options and get the biggest

715
00:45:49,065 --> 00:45:52,405
Speaker 14:  and baddest battery life. So that's kinda what I'm running into right now

716
00:45:52,405 --> 00:45:55,885
Speaker 14:  and maybe others are too. Thank you so much and hopefully

717
00:45:56,355 --> 00:45:58,125
Speaker 14:  talk to you, hear from you soon. Right.

718
00:45:59,445 --> 00:46:03,385
Speaker 2:  So I'm curious your thoughts on this, but I think my general take

719
00:46:03,965 --> 00:46:07,545
Speaker 2:  is the foldable, like the bigger book style

720
00:46:07,695 --> 00:46:11,625
Speaker 2:  foldables have just kind of like the battery life was

721
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:15,465
Speaker 2:  not great and they've kind of gotten to a place where you have parody with

722
00:46:15,745 --> 00:46:19,705
Speaker 2:  a decent slab style phone but not like you should not expect it

723
00:46:19,705 --> 00:46:23,505
Speaker 2:  to exceed like your average slab phone

724
00:46:23,645 --> 00:46:25,545
Speaker 2:  for battery life. What do you think Dom?

725
00:46:26,175 --> 00:46:29,665
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I broadly agree with that. I think one thing I'd say for the big

726
00:46:29,695 --> 00:46:33,665
Speaker 11:  foldables is so much of it's gonna come down to how you expect to use it.

727
00:46:34,305 --> 00:46:37,825
Speaker 11:  Which is what I mean by that is how much are you gonna open it up. I'm a

728
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:41,585
Speaker 11:  very boring foldable user when I'm reviewing them because I,

729
00:46:41,825 --> 00:46:45,145
Speaker 11:  I actually don't find that many uses for the big screen personally. So I

730
00:46:45,145 --> 00:46:48,785
Speaker 11:  use it 90% of the time as a regular phone closed

731
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:52,225
Speaker 11:  and the battery life then is pretty comparable. You're not really getting

732
00:46:52,385 --> 00:46:55,065
Speaker 11:  a difference. Now obviously people listening will be, well why on earth

733
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:57,545
Speaker 11:  would I buy one of these if I'm not gonna open it up all the time? So that's

734
00:46:57,705 --> 00:47:01,065
Speaker 11:  a very fair point. The battery life will go down when you open it up, but

735
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:04,665
Speaker 11:  you should think about like, do you want it to be something that you can

736
00:47:04,665 --> 00:47:08,185
Speaker 11:  open up for half an hour on your commute in the morning

737
00:47:08,565 --> 00:47:11,345
Speaker 11:  and occasionally when you are, you know, sitting on the couch and just wanna,

738
00:47:11,345 --> 00:47:14,585
Speaker 11:  wanna read or is this something where you think all the time you're using

739
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:17,545
Speaker 11:  this, you're gonna open it up and use the big screen. 'cause the more you

740
00:47:17,545 --> 00:47:20,025
Speaker 11:  use the big screen, the worst the battery's gonna be. So there's a bit of

741
00:47:20,025 --> 00:47:20,585
Speaker 11:  a trade off there.

742
00:47:21,065 --> 00:47:24,145
Speaker 2:  I have a similar experience where I'm just, I don't know if it's because

743
00:47:24,265 --> 00:47:28,185
Speaker 2:  I just use a slab style phone all the time, but I, I sort of

744
00:47:28,185 --> 00:47:31,925
Speaker 2:  have to remind myself like, oh no, this phone opens, I need to open it. Yeah.

745
00:47:32,085 --> 00:47:35,245
Speaker 2:  And like try it that way. And I, I'll inevitably like

746
00:47:36,085 --> 00:47:39,765
Speaker 2:  download Diablo Immortal or something to it to like really

747
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:43,645
Speaker 2:  play and test it out and I'm like, a, I think I would do this

748
00:47:43,795 --> 00:47:47,765
Speaker 2:  more because it's so much nicer on a big screen and

749
00:47:47,885 --> 00:47:51,685
Speaker 2:  b wow does that kill the battery life like So fast? Yeah. So yeah,

750
00:47:51,825 --> 00:47:55,405
Speaker 2:  it is, it is so variable And I wouldn't

751
00:47:55,685 --> 00:47:59,605
Speaker 2:  discount like your phone habits maybe changing once you

752
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:03,365
Speaker 2:  have the option of a, of a bigger tablet like

753
00:48:03,655 --> 00:48:07,645
Speaker 2:  experience. But I don't know, I did read a lot of comments

754
00:48:08,445 --> 00:48:12,085
Speaker 2:  recently on, on something I wrote about foldables where foldable owners

755
00:48:12,195 --> 00:48:16,165
Speaker 2:  were saying that they rarely open their folding phone. And

756
00:48:16,165 --> 00:48:16,805
Speaker 2:  I was like, oh,

757
00:48:17,085 --> 00:48:19,965
Speaker 11:  Interesting. I've always thought that was a me problem. So it's, it's interesting

758
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:23,485
Speaker 11:  know people who actually own them kind of feel the same way sometimes. Yeah.

759
00:48:23,725 --> 00:48:26,965
Speaker 11:  I guess there's two other things I'd say to Brian on that question

760
00:48:27,815 --> 00:48:31,485
Speaker 11:  first, I think you are right that a flip phone is probably not for you

761
00:48:32,005 --> 00:48:34,885
Speaker 11:  from the description of what you want. And especially if battery life is

762
00:48:34,885 --> 00:48:38,845
Speaker 11:  the concern, I think the flip phones still struggle there. Like you said

763
00:48:38,845 --> 00:48:41,965
Speaker 11:  Alison, you can kind of the, the book style give you parity with a decent

764
00:48:42,325 --> 00:48:45,965
Speaker 11:  slab on battery life. The flips are definitely still behind and

765
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,845
Speaker 11:  they're good enough right now to run for a day. But you know, if you're

766
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:51,965
Speaker 11:  gonna use it for four years, I wouldn't trust it'll be good enough to last

767
00:48:52,005 --> 00:48:55,405
Speaker 11:  a day in four years time on any of the flips really. And the other thing

768
00:48:55,405 --> 00:48:58,165
Speaker 11:  I'll say is the little, the rest of the world perspective, because this

769
00:48:58,305 --> 00:49:02,125
Speaker 11:  is a different story outside of the US though it's only beginning

770
00:49:02,145 --> 00:49:06,005
Speaker 11:  to change this year. We've seen a lot of big foldables coming out with

771
00:49:06,005 --> 00:49:09,925
Speaker 11:  silicon carbon batteries, which are meaning they're getting bigger capacities.

772
00:49:10,065 --> 00:49:13,925
Speaker 11:  So I reviewed the Oppo Find N five, which was at the time the

773
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:17,765
Speaker 11:  thinnest around and that had a, I think a 5,600 million power

774
00:49:17,765 --> 00:49:21,645
Speaker 11:  battery vivo just put out foldable And I think it's just in China and

775
00:49:21,645 --> 00:49:25,565
Speaker 11:  India, the X fold five that's got a 6,000 million power battery though

776
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:29,525
Speaker 11:  I haven't tried that one. It's wild honor have announced the magic

777
00:49:29,805 --> 00:49:33,605
Speaker 11:  V five in China, but they've also announced that it's getting a a, a European

778
00:49:33,605 --> 00:49:36,965
Speaker 11:  release at least very soon. That one is I think

779
00:49:36,965 --> 00:49:40,885
Speaker 11:  5,800 million powers. If all those numbers sound

780
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:44,205
Speaker 11:  like nonsense to you, all three of those battery capacities are bigger than

781
00:49:44,205 --> 00:49:47,965
Speaker 11:  an S 25 ultra by some way. Yeah. So these are all big

782
00:49:48,195 --> 00:49:51,005
Speaker 11:  foldables that could beat most slap phones.

783
00:49:51,915 --> 00:49:52,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

784
00:49:52,425 --> 00:49:55,925
Speaker 11:  So this is happening. It's changing. Like I said, those aren't even all

785
00:49:55,925 --> 00:49:58,605
Speaker 11:  out in Europe. I think the honor will be out in Europe, but the other two

786
00:49:58,605 --> 00:50:02,445
Speaker 11:  aren't. But if you are in Europe, if you're in India, if you're elsewhere

787
00:50:02,445 --> 00:50:06,245
Speaker 11:  in in Asia or somewhere, look at those brands because you might actually

788
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:08,885
Speaker 11:  find that there are some recent models from this year that, that really

789
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:12,445
Speaker 11:  are up there with not just an average slab phone for battery life, but up

790
00:50:12,445 --> 00:50:14,045
Speaker 11:  there with the best slab phones for battery life.

791
00:50:14,475 --> 00:50:18,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And there's, there's been a real hesitation from,

792
00:50:18,665 --> 00:50:22,325
Speaker 2:  at at least Google and Samsung from what I can tell about

793
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:27,045
Speaker 2:  adopting the silicon carbon batteries. So I wouldn't expect

794
00:50:27,085 --> 00:50:30,885
Speaker 2:  that to change anytime like super soon, but you

795
00:50:30,885 --> 00:50:33,565
Speaker 2:  never know. I don't know, maybe we can have nice things too.

796
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:38,525
Speaker 11:  Yeah. I think this is a change that's gonna roll out faster and faster elsewhere,

797
00:50:39,025 --> 00:50:42,965
Speaker 11:  but I, I don't expect either Samsung or Google to be jumping on this just

798
00:50:42,965 --> 00:50:45,765
Speaker 11:  yet. But we'll see. It'd be nice if they did. Yeah, because it really is

799
00:50:45,765 --> 00:50:48,965
Speaker 11:  gonna be, you know, both in Foldables And I regular phones, this is gonna

800
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:51,885
Speaker 11:  be a, a big driver of bigger batteries and smaller phones.

801
00:50:52,395 --> 00:50:55,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Maybe we can have it all smaller phones.

802
00:50:55,295 --> 00:50:58,765
Speaker 11:  Maybe we can have small phones again because we can have big batteries in

803
00:50:58,765 --> 00:50:59,565
Speaker 11:  our small phones. Oh

804
00:50:59,565 --> 00:51:03,445
Speaker 2:  My god, please. Okay, now I am rooting for silicon

805
00:51:03,445 --> 00:51:07,245
Speaker 2:  carbon And I want it now. Next up we

806
00:51:07,245 --> 00:51:11,165
Speaker 2:  have just a very Charming question from

807
00:51:11,345 --> 00:51:11,765
Speaker 2:  Smiley.

808
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:17,385
Speaker 15:  Hey, my name is Smiley Roja Nunez. AKA Smiley, no

809
00:51:17,385 --> 00:51:21,145
Speaker 15:  really singer songwriter. I'm calling in because I have a

810
00:51:21,195 --> 00:51:25,065
Speaker 15:  Pixel four A 5G that I refuse to upgrade

811
00:51:25,135 --> 00:51:29,105
Speaker 15:  from. Long story short, the pixel four A 5G has a headphone

812
00:51:29,105 --> 00:51:33,065
Speaker 15:  jack And I like to go and perform music

813
00:51:33,285 --> 00:51:36,905
Speaker 15:  in little clubs and open mics and it's so useful to have that headphone

814
00:51:36,905 --> 00:51:40,465
Speaker 15:  jack. Also, it's one of the last pixels with the

815
00:51:40,535 --> 00:51:44,305
Speaker 15:  unlimited photo storage. I don't feel like paying for a

816
00:51:44,305 --> 00:51:48,025
Speaker 15:  plan first photo storage, so that's another reason why I haven't upgraded.

817
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:52,385
Speaker 15:  But now it does feel like it's getting in my way when it comes to using

818
00:51:52,415 --> 00:51:56,065
Speaker 15:  Instagram, which unfortunately is a tool that I need to use to promote

819
00:51:56,085 --> 00:52:00,065
Speaker 15:  myself and my artistry. So I'm thinking of upgrading.

820
00:52:00,865 --> 00:52:04,425
Speaker 15:  I know that the one plus 13 is the best Android phone

821
00:52:04,425 --> 00:52:08,225
Speaker 15:  available right now, but sadly it's huge. So

822
00:52:08,285 --> 00:52:09,985
Speaker 15:  I'm like, what to do, what to do.

823
00:52:11,745 --> 00:52:15,705
Speaker 15:  I don't know that I need this year's latest model, but yeah, appreciate

824
00:52:15,705 --> 00:52:19,105
Speaker 15:  you listening to this message and help a brother out.

825
00:52:19,475 --> 00:52:20,185
Speaker 15:  Peace. Peace.

826
00:52:22,585 --> 00:52:26,205
Speaker 2:  I'm just very charmed, my smiley And I love

827
00:52:26,315 --> 00:52:29,685
Speaker 2:  that he is held onto the pixel Forer 5G

828
00:52:30,075 --> 00:52:33,725
Speaker 2:  like way to go, way to milk Google for the

829
00:52:33,725 --> 00:52:37,525
Speaker 2:  unlimited photo storage and hold onto that headphone

830
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:40,925
Speaker 2:  jack. But I think this is another like

831
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,365
Speaker 2:  bad news kinda situation. I'm, I'm like

832
00:52:45,565 --> 00:52:49,165
Speaker 2:  racking my brain for a, a like flagship

833
00:52:49,485 --> 00:52:53,005
Speaker 2:  ish phone that has a headphone jack And I'm

834
00:52:53,705 --> 00:52:56,085
Speaker 2:  try Jelly figure out if Motorola sells one.

835
00:52:57,025 --> 00:53:01,005
Speaker 11:  No. Yeah, I feel like some of the cheaper models might still have

836
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:04,605
Speaker 11:  headphone jacks. Yeah, I don't think anything higher end

837
00:53:04,995 --> 00:53:08,965
Speaker 11:  does even, you know, in, in Europe they have the whole Edge series, which

838
00:53:08,965 --> 00:53:12,405
Speaker 11:  is kind of mid-range bordering on flagship and, and some of those come out

839
00:53:12,405 --> 00:53:15,565
Speaker 11:  in the states under different names, but none of those have headphone jacks.

840
00:53:15,565 --> 00:53:19,045
Speaker 11:  I think, I think you need to be looking at like the Moto G kind of

841
00:53:20,025 --> 00:53:23,485
Speaker 11:  budget, couple hundred bucks models And I FI feel like some of those still

842
00:53:23,485 --> 00:53:25,805
Speaker 11:  have a headphone jack kicking around, but yeah,

843
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:26,485
Speaker 2:  That's right.

844
00:53:26,685 --> 00:53:30,165
Speaker 11:  I dunno how much of a performance bump that will feel like even coming from

845
00:53:30,205 --> 00:53:33,005
Speaker 11:  a, I guess the foray is old so they, they will feel better than a foray

846
00:53:33,025 --> 00:53:35,405
Speaker 11:  but not, not like a giant jump forward.

847
00:53:36,115 --> 00:53:40,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's what, okay. The Moto G stylist I

848
00:53:40,045 --> 00:53:43,805
Speaker 2:  believe has a headphone jack and like a

849
00:53:43,805 --> 00:53:47,485
Speaker 2:  very nice kind of vegan leather back

850
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:50,685
Speaker 2:  panel. The thing that I am

851
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:55,165
Speaker 2:  a little hesitant about is that it is just loaded with bloat wear,

852
00:53:55,845 --> 00:53:59,325
Speaker 2:  a lot of which you can opt out of and uninstall.

853
00:53:59,865 --> 00:54:03,805
Speaker 2:  So if you're willing to do that, it's a nice little phone.

854
00:54:04,245 --> 00:54:07,285
Speaker 2:  I, I also worry a little bit about

855
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:11,605
Speaker 2:  longevity if you would. I feel like Smiley kind of wants

856
00:54:11,605 --> 00:54:15,445
Speaker 2:  to hold onto a phone for a while given that he's still rocking the

857
00:54:15,445 --> 00:54:18,885
Speaker 2:  four A 5G and Motorola, especially for the budget,

858
00:54:19,305 --> 00:54:23,285
Speaker 2:  you get maybe two or three years of upgrades

859
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:26,445
Speaker 2:  and then you're, you're done. So you're shopping for a new phone again,

860
00:54:27,345 --> 00:54:30,285
Speaker 2:  But that might be the only option with the headphone jack.

861
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:34,805
Speaker 11:  Yeah, my other hesitation on the Motorola would be the camera. 'cause Smiley

862
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:37,925
Speaker 11:  mentioned, you know, being interested by the opo, which the, the find

863
00:54:38,005 --> 00:54:41,965
Speaker 11:  XASI think is the, the phone that the mini ended up being, you know,

864
00:54:41,965 --> 00:54:45,805
Speaker 11:  call that out for being smallish with a camera but the Moto

865
00:54:45,805 --> 00:54:49,045
Speaker 11:  is, is is not gonna have a great camera I if anything, that might be one

866
00:54:49,045 --> 00:54:51,725
Speaker 11:  bit where it really does feel like a downgrade from a four A because it's,

867
00:54:51,805 --> 00:54:55,005
Speaker 11:  I think any, yeah, pixel camera almost. It's gonna beat, beat sort of what

868
00:54:55,005 --> 00:54:58,725
Speaker 11:  you find on a, on a cheap Motorola Motorola's cameras

869
00:54:58,985 --> 00:55:02,685
Speaker 11:  are good on some of the higher end models but not on, I doubt the G stylus

870
00:55:02,685 --> 00:55:04,365
Speaker 11:  is, is gonna be a real winner for that side.

871
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah, that's a good call out.

872
00:55:06,895 --> 00:55:10,765
Speaker 11:  There sort of is one phone that kind of exists that does this almost,

873
00:55:10,785 --> 00:55:13,885
Speaker 11:  but I, I don't think, I don't think this might can buy it in the US And

874
00:55:13,885 --> 00:55:17,765
Speaker 11:  I don't think he should, which is the Sony Xperia

875
00:55:18,105 --> 00:55:21,125
Speaker 11:  one, Mach seven. Right. Which is kind of

876
00:55:21,635 --> 00:55:25,525
Speaker 11:  compact ish. It's got a headphone jack, it's

877
00:55:25,525 --> 00:55:29,365
Speaker 11:  got pretty good cameras. Not the best, But that they're not bad. I

878
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:33,285
Speaker 11:  dunno how great they are for longevity, but it's not out in the US

879
00:55:34,235 --> 00:55:37,405
Speaker 11:  That particular model has had some issues. They've had to do a recall for

880
00:55:37,405 --> 00:55:41,365
Speaker 11:  a lot of units across Europe. I certainly wouldn't trust Sony on

881
00:55:41,365 --> 00:55:44,605
Speaker 11:  the longevity in terms of their commitment to the smartphone market. They

882
00:55:44,725 --> 00:55:47,085
Speaker 11:  actually just said they like recent quarterly earnings that it's, you know,

883
00:55:47,085 --> 00:55:50,605
Speaker 11:  The Xperia phone business is very important to them but I, I dunno how much

884
00:55:50,645 --> 00:55:54,125
Speaker 11:  I believe that, but putting out one or two phones a year and and barely

885
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:57,245
Speaker 11:  releasing them at all, even if you could buy it, I think it would be about,

886
00:55:57,425 --> 00:56:00,045
Speaker 11:  you know, one and a half grand is the, the price, right. So

887
00:56:00,045 --> 00:56:00,845
Speaker 2:  It's, oh my God,

888
00:56:00,845 --> 00:56:04,645
Speaker 11:  It's crazy expensive for what it is. Yeah, so that is the phone, but also

889
00:56:04,645 --> 00:56:05,405
Speaker 11:  don't buy that phone.

890
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:09,805
Speaker 2:  It exists but also, yeah, don't, yeah, I,

891
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:14,085
Speaker 2:  you know, a couple years back I think I was still reviewing Xperia phones

892
00:56:14,465 --> 00:56:17,965
Speaker 2:  and yeah it was that kind of like, this is

893
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:22,645
Speaker 2:  very pricey and I'm only hearing like two

894
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:26,445
Speaker 2:  years of software support promise. So just like the

895
00:56:26,475 --> 00:56:30,245
Speaker 2:  math just just doesn't work for me there I think among other reasons.

896
00:56:30,545 --> 00:56:34,485
Speaker 2:  But yeah, I don't know. Let us know Smiley, I hope you find

897
00:56:34,485 --> 00:56:38,285
Speaker 2:  something or maybe just gonna have to join the rest

898
00:56:38,285 --> 00:56:41,965
Speaker 2:  of us in, in the world who lost the headphone jack

899
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:45,245
Speaker 2:  and we, we mourn it every day. So I've got

900
00:56:45,755 --> 00:56:49,205
Speaker 2:  another one here. This is from TJ Huddleston.

901
00:56:49,985 --> 00:56:53,845
Speaker 2:  He also messaged me on Threads or Blue Sky, one of those

902
00:56:53,985 --> 00:56:57,525
Speaker 2:  And I kind of hinted at what I think he should get, but

903
00:56:58,185 --> 00:56:59,725
Speaker 2:  here's TJ explaining it.

904
00:57:01,345 --> 00:57:05,085
Speaker 16:  Hey, my name is TJ Huddleston. I am considering switching from iOS

905
00:57:05,145 --> 00:57:08,885
Speaker 16:  to Android and I'm not really sure if that is the right move for me.

906
00:57:09,405 --> 00:57:13,365
Speaker 16:  I, I used Android from its inception up until the iPhone 12

907
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:16,325
Speaker 16:  and one of the reasons I switched the iPhone 12 is I just wanted my phone

908
00:57:16,345 --> 00:57:20,285
Speaker 16:  to work. I was, used my phone for work more often And I got tired

909
00:57:20,285 --> 00:57:24,125
Speaker 16:  of all the slowness and and uncertainty when it came to Android

910
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:28,485
Speaker 16:  but now I'm just getting bored. But here's my, my issue is that

911
00:57:28,525 --> 00:57:32,485
Speaker 16:  I work in a construction related field and so I always need access to

912
00:57:32,485 --> 00:57:36,125
Speaker 16:  my phone. My phone is a tool and so I need really good battery life but

913
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:40,005
Speaker 16:  also I need a good warranty service. One of the things I really like about

914
00:57:40,225 --> 00:57:44,125
Speaker 16:  having an iPhone or Apple device in general is that I can go to an

915
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:47,845
Speaker 16:  Apple store And I can have my phone fixed most of the time the same day.

916
00:57:48,585 --> 00:57:52,005
Speaker 16:  And so I really want that capacity whenever I switch to an Android phone.

917
00:57:52,315 --> 00:57:56,125
Speaker 16:  Part of me just wants to get a Samsung, maybe the S 25 Ultra because

918
00:57:56,125 --> 00:58:00,005
Speaker 16:  it has that nice stylus And I can annotate on pictures and stuff like that.

919
00:58:00,425 --> 00:58:03,765
Speaker 16:  So my question for Allison is if you were focused on

920
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:08,285
Speaker 16:  Repairability or maybe service when it came

921
00:58:08,305 --> 00:58:12,165
Speaker 16:  to to maintenance and repairs, who would you choose? Thanks.

922
00:58:12,275 --> 00:58:12,885
Speaker 16:  Love the show.

923
00:58:14,165 --> 00:58:17,925
Speaker 2:  I love that TJ And I agree because he,

924
00:58:18,385 --> 00:58:21,685
Speaker 2:  he names the phone I think he should get which is the,

925
00:58:22,345 --> 00:58:25,885
Speaker 2:  the S 25 Ultra and there's a a few reasons

926
00:58:26,145 --> 00:58:30,045
Speaker 2:  for that, some of which he mentions, but I'm curious if that was your instinct

927
00:58:30,045 --> 00:58:30,685
Speaker 2:  too, Dom.

928
00:58:31,435 --> 00:58:35,365
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I mean definitely if we're talking about the US

929
00:58:35,385 --> 00:58:39,285
Speaker 11:  and, and even really outside the US it's gotta be Samsung. If,

930
00:58:39,465 --> 00:58:43,085
Speaker 11:  if your aim is serviceability and you want to be able to get

931
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:47,085
Speaker 11:  quick, easy, reliable repairs for a device and you don't want

932
00:58:47,085 --> 00:58:50,965
Speaker 11:  it to be an Apple, then yeah Samsung is is absolutely gonna be the next

933
00:58:50,965 --> 00:58:54,645
Speaker 11:  best thing And Google third best it it is one of those cases where the big

934
00:58:54,645 --> 00:58:58,485
Speaker 11:  brands that play in the US are are absolutely the best options. And then

935
00:58:58,585 --> 00:59:02,045
Speaker 11:  you know, the S 25 Ultra it sounds like he, you know, TJ likes the sound

936
00:59:02,045 --> 00:59:04,845
Speaker 11:  of the stylus and the big display. He talked about wanting a foldable for

937
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:06,445
Speaker 11:  the big screen so going for the ultra makes sense.

938
00:59:07,235 --> 00:59:11,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah, And I, I would steer him away from a

939
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:14,925
Speaker 2:  foldable in this case. Yes. Just for the, yeah, the repairability

940
00:59:14,925 --> 00:59:18,565
Speaker 2:  things he mentions and like I can see how the, the big inner

941
00:59:18,565 --> 00:59:22,125
Speaker 2:  screen would really come in handy. But I guess I think that's a, a

942
00:59:22,485 --> 00:59:26,245
Speaker 2:  situation where you, you like also have a tablet if you

943
00:59:26,245 --> 00:59:29,765
Speaker 2:  need that kind of thing. But the S 25 Ultra being a

944
00:59:30,405 --> 00:59:34,245
Speaker 2:  gigantic phone is the closest you're gonna get on a slab

945
00:59:34,245 --> 00:59:38,205
Speaker 2:  style phone. Something else going for the Ultra is that, and

946
00:59:38,205 --> 00:59:41,885
Speaker 2:  it doesn't get talked about enough I think is the anti-glare

947
00:59:42,115 --> 00:59:45,605
Speaker 2:  coating on the screen, which is really good

948
00:59:45,985 --> 00:59:49,965
Speaker 2:  and especially if he is working outside with it a lot and if the,

949
00:59:50,065 --> 00:59:54,045
Speaker 2:  you know, sun's shining we're sort of used to like casting a shadow

950
00:59:54,075 --> 00:59:58,045
Speaker 2:  over your phone and like hunching over it and you then you can see it outside.

951
00:59:58,625 --> 01:00:01,885
Speaker 2:  You have to see it to believe it but the ultra really is like

952
01:00:02,305 --> 01:00:04,285
Speaker 2:  better to use outside I think.

953
01:00:04,955 --> 01:00:08,445
Speaker 11:  Yeah, that's a great shout. Yeah, we've seen all, all the brands over the

954
01:00:08,445 --> 01:00:12,085
Speaker 11:  last few years sort of competing on claims about how bright the displays

955
01:00:12,085 --> 01:00:16,005
Speaker 11:  get with that focus on use set doors and it almost doesn't matter

956
01:00:16,005 --> 01:00:19,645
Speaker 11:  because the ultra is there with the anti ggl coating that does a much better

957
01:00:19,665 --> 01:00:21,605
Speaker 11:  job than just pumping up the brightness in the screen.

958
01:00:22,275 --> 01:00:26,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah it's, it's kinda wild. So I think it's a good

959
01:00:26,305 --> 01:00:29,045
Speaker 2:  choice for that. And like you mentioned the,

960
01:00:30,035 --> 01:00:33,925
Speaker 2:  just the availability of places you can walk into, you know Samsung

961
01:00:34,225 --> 01:00:38,205
Speaker 2:  has an agreement I think with it's called like You break,

962
01:00:38,445 --> 01:00:41,165
Speaker 2:  I fix it, not I fix

963
01:00:41,165 --> 01:00:41,405
Speaker 11:  It. Yeah,

964
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:44,405
Speaker 2:  I think that's it. Something along those lines. But I see enough of those

965
01:00:44,425 --> 01:00:48,365
Speaker 2:  around that I sort of file it away in the back of my head like

966
01:00:48,365 --> 01:00:50,645
Speaker 2:  yeah I could bring a Samsung phone there if I needed to.

967
01:00:51,405 --> 01:00:54,125
Speaker 11:  I say this with a little hesitation 'cause I'm not a hundred percent on

968
01:00:54,145 --> 01:00:57,325
Speaker 11:  the US market side of this but I'm pretty sure Samsung has some sort of

969
01:00:57,485 --> 01:01:01,045
Speaker 11:  subscription care service, a little like AppleCare plus, you know Yeah.

970
01:01:01,145 --> 01:01:03,645
Speaker 11:  One of those sign up and pay them, pay 'em a certain amount per month and

971
01:01:03,645 --> 01:01:07,005
Speaker 11:  it gets you a guarantee of a certain number of, of repairs or easier access

972
01:01:07,005 --> 01:01:08,925
Speaker 11:  to repairs or something like that. So that would be something to look at

973
01:01:08,925 --> 01:01:12,645
Speaker 11:  as well if you are, if you know that that worry that you are

974
01:01:12,675 --> 01:01:16,645
Speaker 11:  regularly breaking your phone. Yeah. If you have that concern. The wild

975
01:01:16,645 --> 01:01:20,565
Speaker 11:  card I'd say again with my little non-US hat on is a

976
01:01:20,565 --> 01:01:24,245
Speaker 11:  Fairphone, which is a very different take on repairability and serviceability

977
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:28,525
Speaker 11:  'cause you fix it yourself but they are very easy to fix for the most part.

978
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:32,565
Speaker 11:  I would just be reviewing The Fairphone six, the latest model And I

979
01:01:32,565 --> 01:01:35,205
Speaker 11:  am a complete idiot with this kinda stuff but I'm actually take the phone

980
01:01:35,215 --> 01:01:38,925
Speaker 11:  completely apart to its parts and put it all the way back together and it

981
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:41,565
Speaker 11:  still worked at the other end of it all and they sell their own, you know,

982
01:01:41,755 --> 01:01:45,405
Speaker 11:  replacement displays, USB ports, speakers, individual camera

983
01:01:45,405 --> 01:01:49,365
Speaker 11:  modules, things like that. You can get The Fairphone in the US but

984
01:01:49,365 --> 01:01:53,005
Speaker 11:  they're only sold through this company called Moreno that makes this privacy

985
01:01:53,345 --> 01:01:57,325
Speaker 11:  de Googled os it makes 'em quite expensive and the OS is

986
01:01:57,405 --> 01:02:00,925
Speaker 11:  a little specific and limiting I, I don't totally

987
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:04,765
Speaker 11:  dislike it but you've gotta want the D Googled side of it. Yeah. And if

988
01:02:04,765 --> 01:02:07,765
Speaker 11:  that doesn't appeal, I think you'll find it quite frustrating. Especially

989
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:11,565
Speaker 11:  if, if TJ's hesitation was that he'd been in the Roy

990
01:02:11,565 --> 01:02:14,685
Speaker 11:  early days of Android and and was hoping it was a lot better and more polished.

991
01:02:15,405 --> 01:02:19,165
Speaker 11:  EOS is good but I don't think polished is like the word. It feels a bit

992
01:02:19,165 --> 01:02:22,125
Speaker 11:  like going back to Android five years ago. Yeah. But if you are outside

993
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:25,485
Speaker 11:  the US or in the US and willing to import, you can get a Fairphone with

994
01:02:25,855 --> 01:02:29,805
Speaker 11:  their own software, which is kind of closer to stock modern Google and

995
01:02:29,805 --> 01:02:32,525
Speaker 11:  works pretty well and you know, they give you years of software updates.

996
01:02:32,585 --> 01:02:36,525
Speaker 11:  You can fix the phone easily yourself, get spare pots. So that's a very

997
01:02:36,525 --> 01:02:39,525
Speaker 11:  different take on on wanting a phone that's serviceable repairable, but

998
01:02:39,525 --> 01:02:41,045
Speaker 11:  that's, that's an option elsewhere as well.

999
01:02:41,715 --> 01:02:45,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The DIY option, I took a

1000
01:02:45,505 --> 01:02:49,405
Speaker 2:  an HMD skyline apart and not, not like really

1001
01:02:49,405 --> 01:02:52,845
Speaker 2:  apart. It's a, it's one of those like ultra repairable phones. Yeah. And

1002
01:02:53,285 --> 01:02:57,125
Speaker 2:  replaced the battery myself And I felt like I was

1003
01:02:57,125 --> 01:03:00,325
Speaker 2:  unstoppable. I, I was like I wanna take every phone apart.

1004
01:03:01,525 --> 01:03:05,285
Speaker 11:  I know. It was so much fun. Dissembling this Fairphone I surrounded by tiny

1005
01:03:05,305 --> 01:03:08,085
Speaker 11:  screws and, And I only got two bits wrong And I put it back together and

1006
01:03:08,145 --> 01:03:11,125
Speaker 11:  it still worked once I figured that out so. Oh nice. Anyone can do it if

1007
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:11,325
Speaker 11:  I can.

1008
01:03:11,745 --> 01:03:14,965
Speaker 2:  TJ let me know what, what you bought, what you plan on buying

1009
01:03:15,785 --> 01:03:19,565
Speaker 2:  and good luck to you. So last

1010
01:03:19,715 --> 01:03:22,845
Speaker 2:  kind of call in here we have Sean with

1011
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:27,485
Speaker 2:  I think a conundrum that I hear a lot from people. So

1012
01:03:27,775 --> 01:03:28,645
Speaker 2:  we'll listen to Sean.

1013
01:03:30,445 --> 01:03:34,345
Speaker 17:  Hey Allison, I am kind of torn. I

1014
01:03:34,455 --> 01:03:38,185
Speaker 17:  have been in the Android ecosystem for a very long time then

1015
01:03:38,345 --> 01:03:42,305
Speaker 17:  I switched to iPhones because my company switched to iPhones. Then

1016
01:03:43,145 --> 01:03:46,185
Speaker 17:  I ended up getting my own personal iPhone. So I've, you know, now I have

1017
01:03:46,185 --> 01:03:50,145
Speaker 17:  two phones and I'm kind of debating do I want to go back to

1018
01:03:50,145 --> 01:03:54,105
Speaker 17:  Android? You know, my whole family is now on iPhones and so it's

1019
01:03:54,105 --> 01:03:58,025
Speaker 17:  like that's really the struggle right, is they all have iPhones. So

1020
01:03:58,025 --> 01:04:01,705
Speaker 17:  now we've got, IM messaging now we've got shared calendars now we've got

1021
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:05,425
Speaker 17:  all these different pieces that kind of integrate to each other. So when

1022
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:09,305
Speaker 17:  I used to have an Android, it was a huge problem because we couldn't

1023
01:04:09,305 --> 01:04:12,545
Speaker 17:  have a shared family calendar. We had to try to make it work between Google

1024
01:04:12,945 --> 01:04:16,385
Speaker 17:  calendar and Apple Calendar and it just, just never great.

1025
01:04:16,805 --> 01:04:20,465
Speaker 17:  So could I just stick with Apple and it just keeps the

1026
01:04:20,855 --> 01:04:23,745
Speaker 17:  ecosystem harmonized together where the whole family's on the same thing

1027
01:04:24,085 --> 01:04:27,985
Speaker 17:  or if I do switch, what are some of the apps that maybe I could use or should

1028
01:04:28,045 --> 01:04:31,805
Speaker 17:  use to try to keep that same compatibility

1029
01:04:31,805 --> 01:04:35,725
Speaker 17:  going across all of the family's devices. Thanks a lot. Have a good

1030
01:04:35,725 --> 01:04:35,885
Speaker 17:  day.

1031
01:04:37,265 --> 01:04:38,825
Speaker 2:  A family divided,

1032
01:04:40,455 --> 01:04:44,145
Speaker 2:  this is always when I see a couple and one of them has an

1033
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:47,945
Speaker 2:  Android, one of them has an iPhone. I am always asking them this question.

1034
01:04:48,245 --> 01:04:51,865
Speaker 2:  I'm like how's that going for you? I feel like my like

1035
01:04:52,325 --> 01:04:56,065
Speaker 2:  big answer is like how much do you wanna keep the piece?

1036
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:59,985
Speaker 2:  And also generally it has gotten better

1037
01:05:00,155 --> 01:05:03,225
Speaker 2:  being a, a mixed OS family

1038
01:05:03,995 --> 01:05:07,785
Speaker 2:  these days than maybe it was you know, five years ago. But do you have a

1039
01:05:07,785 --> 01:05:11,025
Speaker 2:  go-to answer on this Dom when people are grappling with this?

1040
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,855
Speaker 11:  I have no useful practical advice because when I first started

1041
01:05:15,855 --> 01:05:19,365
Speaker 11:  dating my current partner five years ago, she was using an iPhone And I

1042
01:05:19,365 --> 01:05:23,285
Speaker 11:  basically kind of forced her to switch to an Android 'cause she kept getting

1043
01:05:23,285 --> 01:05:25,845
Speaker 11:  jealous of like the cameras on my phones and eventually switched and it

1044
01:05:25,845 --> 01:05:28,605
Speaker 11:  was like, ah, that's better now we, we just sync up and everything's easier.

1045
01:05:28,715 --> 01:05:32,085
Speaker 11:  Yeah. So I haven't had to live that life of, of moving between them. At

1046
01:05:32,085 --> 01:05:35,045
Speaker 11:  least not in the last few years. I agree it's a lot better than it used

1047
01:05:35,205 --> 01:05:38,965
Speaker 11:  to be. If, if Sean's experiences from a few

1048
01:05:38,965 --> 01:05:42,885
Speaker 11:  years ago and kind of comparing five to 10 years ago that

1049
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:46,845
Speaker 11:  that process to now it it will definitely be better. 80 to

1050
01:05:46,845 --> 01:05:50,685
Speaker 11:  90% of the time everything will just work and it'll be fine and it won't

1051
01:05:50,745 --> 01:05:54,605
Speaker 11:  matter that and you're on an Android phone and your partner

1052
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:58,445
Speaker 11:  or your kids are on or on iPhones and there'll be that one time where

1053
01:05:58,445 --> 01:06:02,125
Speaker 11:  some calendar bit goes a bit screwy or you know, the messaging app

1054
01:06:02,155 --> 01:06:05,205
Speaker 11:  gets annoying or something like that and then you'll all be really irritated

1055
01:06:05,225 --> 01:06:09,205
Speaker 11:  by it. And how invested are you avoiding those

1056
01:06:09,235 --> 01:06:12,525
Speaker 11:  sort of sporadic irritations is the question. Yeah.

1057
01:06:12,905 --> 01:06:16,765
Speaker 2:  And it will be your fault. It doesn't matter if like if

1058
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:20,045
Speaker 2:  the Apple products are not getting it right, it doesn't matter, it's your

1059
01:06:20,045 --> 01:06:23,645
Speaker 2:  fault. I have lived this in my own

1060
01:06:23,645 --> 01:06:27,485
Speaker 2:  household. Yeah And I will say like especially in the US we

1061
01:06:27,495 --> 01:06:31,085
Speaker 2:  don't tend to use the third party messaging apps like you all do.

1062
01:06:31,665 --> 01:06:35,645
Speaker 2:  So having RCS support on iOS now

1063
01:06:36,305 --> 01:06:40,245
Speaker 2:  has been huge. When I am on an Android phone now and I'm

1064
01:06:40,545 --> 01:06:44,165
Speaker 2:  on a flight, I can still message my husband on his

1065
01:06:44,185 --> 01:06:48,125
Speaker 2:  iPhone because we're just doing RCS over wifi and all that. So

1066
01:06:48,315 --> 01:06:52,165
Speaker 2:  that has been a really big like help I think to

1067
01:06:52,165 --> 01:06:56,045
Speaker 2:  the people in the, the mixed ecosystem situation.

1068
01:06:56,435 --> 01:06:59,525
Speaker 2:  Something I will add is that the very recent

1069
01:07:00,095 --> 01:07:03,885
Speaker 2:  Pixel 10 phones come with Q2, which

1070
01:07:03,905 --> 01:07:07,805
Speaker 2:  is a wireless charging standard but also has the magnets built

1071
01:07:07,865 --> 01:07:11,845
Speaker 2:  in and it's, it's basically MagSafe. So if your

1072
01:07:11,845 --> 01:07:15,765
Speaker 2:  family's using MagSafe accessories, they have things around the

1073
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:19,645
Speaker 2:  house that you know, you would not normally be able to plug into like

1074
01:07:19,765 --> 01:07:23,485
Speaker 2:  a magnetic charger. You could look at the Pixel 10

1075
01:07:23,825 --> 01:07:27,565
Speaker 2:  and you'd be able to just like slide right into that

1076
01:07:27,715 --> 01:07:31,365
Speaker 2:  ecosystem there. But yeah, I think that your

1077
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:35,405
Speaker 2:  point of like something is gonna go a little sideways, you can,

1078
01:07:35,725 --> 01:07:38,805
Speaker 2:  I, I certainly have been fine with

1079
01:07:39,325 --> 01:07:43,005
Speaker 2:  calendars, you know switching between iPhone and Android. I think I've gotten

1080
01:07:44,065 --> 01:07:47,805
Speaker 2:  it takes a little bit of futzing around but you can

1081
01:07:47,945 --> 01:07:51,485
Speaker 2:  get, you know all the Google calendars you're supposed to see on iPhone

1082
01:07:52,025 --> 01:07:55,325
Speaker 2:  and vice versa. Something goes weird sometimes

1083
01:07:55,945 --> 01:07:59,645
Speaker 2:  And I don't know, you just gotta own it. If you're cool with that then

1084
01:08:00,385 --> 01:08:04,205
Speaker 2:  the world is your oyster on Android. So we have a bunch

1085
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:07,845
Speaker 2:  more questions. We'll get into some emails but we're gonna take a really

1086
01:08:07,845 --> 01:08:08,405
Speaker 2:  quick break.

1087
01:10:47,695 --> 01:10:51,535
Speaker 2:  different kinds of content to read. Reads two to three books

1088
01:10:51,655 --> 01:10:55,495
Speaker 2:  a week and also says she doesn't care about AI until it stops

1089
01:10:55,495 --> 01:10:58,775
Speaker 2:  hallucinating or has a killer app or something. Amen to that.

1090
01:10:59,675 --> 01:11:03,455
Speaker 2:  So the conundrum is because she

1091
01:11:03,455 --> 01:11:07,375
Speaker 2:  owns her phone, she's under no pressure to move but she wants

1092
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:11,135
Speaker 2:  to make the reading experience better. Does she look at a

1093
01:11:11,135 --> 01:11:14,325
Speaker 2:  books device or a kind of premium

1094
01:11:15,345 --> 01:11:19,125
Speaker 2:  reader? She says swollen an e-reader is interesting.

1095
01:11:19,335 --> 01:11:22,925
Speaker 2:  She's more of a one device type of girl. So

1096
01:11:23,675 --> 01:11:27,645
Speaker 2:  yeah this one is interesting because I know more people

1097
01:11:27,645 --> 01:11:30,685
Speaker 2:  who definitely have a dedicated device for

1098
01:11:31,275 --> 01:11:34,965
Speaker 2:  reading on the go. Like a Kindle or or like our, our favorite

1099
01:11:35,225 --> 01:11:39,165
Speaker 2:  or books Palms. The really oddball one

1100
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:43,165
Speaker 2:  I'll throw out there And I don't actually think Izzy should

1101
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:47,365
Speaker 2:  buy it. I'm testing this TCL 60

1102
01:11:47,965 --> 01:11:51,845
Speaker 2:  XE that has an E in

1103
01:11:52,165 --> 01:11:55,925
Speaker 2:  ish mode where you, it just brings the screen to

1104
01:11:55,925 --> 01:11:59,645
Speaker 2:  monochrome. You can do it in two ways where it really

1105
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:03,685
Speaker 2:  like is sort of a focus mode thing if you wanna like

1106
01:12:03,905 --> 01:12:07,405
Speaker 2:  pay attention to notifications less or you can just kind of

1107
01:12:08,095 --> 01:12:12,045
Speaker 2:  mimic an E Ink screen and just have access to like all the normal

1108
01:12:12,045 --> 01:12:16,005
Speaker 2:  stuff on your phone. I've been carrying it around as a kind

1109
01:12:16,005 --> 01:12:19,765
Speaker 2:  of second device in my, well I'm not doing anymore but I went

1110
01:12:19,765 --> 01:12:23,725
Speaker 2:  when I was try Jelly use a watch like an LTE watch as my phone.

1111
01:12:24,445 --> 01:12:28,285
Speaker 2:  I had this on me so I would have a screen to read

1112
01:12:28,285 --> 01:12:32,245
Speaker 2:  something and it was all right. It was like surprisingly

1113
01:12:32,995 --> 01:12:36,925
Speaker 2:  kind of pleasant for that. Not a great phone overall. So I don't think

1114
01:12:36,925 --> 01:12:37,525
Speaker 2:  that's the answer.

1115
01:12:39,315 --> 01:12:41,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Do you have any ideas here Dom?

1116
01:12:41,765 --> 01:12:45,525
Speaker 11:  I think Izzy should maybe look more closely at the, the book stall

1117
01:12:45,965 --> 01:12:49,885
Speaker 11:  foldable. It seems to sort of suggest this as an option and

1118
01:12:49,885 --> 01:12:53,725
Speaker 11:  then hesitate about the aspect ratio and the price, which is understandable.

1119
01:12:54,565 --> 01:12:57,925
Speaker 11:  I mean I would say, I said earlier I, when I have a book stall foldable,

1120
01:12:57,965 --> 01:13:01,205
Speaker 11:  I don't actually open them up that much except for reading. Reading is what

1121
01:13:01,205 --> 01:13:04,925
Speaker 11:  I find them really grateful. The aspect ratio when they're open it's kind

1122
01:13:04,925 --> 01:13:08,805
Speaker 11:  of squareish usually or like a a little bit portrait that

1123
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:12,725
Speaker 11:  makes them odd for watching video or playing games and that

1124
01:13:12,725 --> 01:13:16,005
Speaker 11:  vision of open your phone up to watch a movie doesn't really work 'cause

1125
01:13:16,005 --> 01:13:19,845
Speaker 11:  you don't get a lot more space but open your phone up to read a book or

1126
01:13:19,845 --> 01:13:22,765
Speaker 11:  even just, you know, read an article on a website or something And I always

1127
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:25,485
Speaker 11:  do that. That's when I wanna open them 'cause it just feels like suddenly

1128
01:13:25,865 --> 01:13:29,245
Speaker 11:  the screen is so much more spacious, so much more comfortable to read on

1129
01:13:29,265 --> 01:13:33,085
Speaker 11:  And I much prefer that. So I do think if reading is the use case that

1130
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:36,765
Speaker 11:  maybe it sounds like an unnecessary expense to get this sort of one and

1131
01:13:36,765 --> 01:13:40,685
Speaker 11:  a half thousand dollars phone just to read eBooks on. But it is better And

1132
01:13:40,685 --> 01:13:43,165
Speaker 11:  I do think that would be a nice experience. I really think it will feel

1133
01:13:43,165 --> 01:13:46,965
Speaker 11:  like worlds better than reading on a slap phone and definitely better

1134
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:50,365
Speaker 11:  than reading on on a flip phone, which is sort of the other option suggested

1135
01:13:50,365 --> 01:13:53,645
Speaker 11:  there, which I don't think getting a flip phone solves any of the problems

1136
01:13:53,645 --> 01:13:56,605
Speaker 11:  here other than the flip phones are fun And I love flip phones so I do often

1137
01:13:56,845 --> 01:14:00,045
Speaker 11:  recommend them But that doesn't necessarily seem like the right thing here.

1138
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:04,605
Speaker 11:  So I, I would look at a, at a bookstore one they are expensive but you know

1139
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:07,725
Speaker 11:  you can look at a last gen model or something, you know we've just had the

1140
01:14:07,725 --> 01:14:11,285
Speaker 11:  Pixel 10 pro fold. You can look at the nine pro fold and see if that means

1141
01:14:11,285 --> 01:14:14,245
Speaker 11:  you can get it at a better price and that kind of thing. I probably wouldn't

1142
01:14:14,245 --> 01:14:17,365
Speaker 11:  look at the last gen Samsung right now just 'cause they made such a big

1143
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:21,325
Speaker 11:  jump with the, with the Z fold seven. And so the Z fold six is, is

1144
01:14:21,325 --> 01:14:24,565
Speaker 11:  maybe a bigger compromise compared to the pixels where I think the nine

1145
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:28,565
Speaker 11:  is is really giving you a lot of what you get with the 10 i I like the look

1146
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:31,925
Speaker 11:  of the 10 but I, I don't think you're losing too much with the nine unless

1147
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:35,285
Speaker 11:  you really really want the Q2 charging. I read this question And I think

1148
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:38,725
Speaker 11:  yeah buy a big foldable it sounds like that's gonna solve your problem.

1149
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:43,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah the more I hear you argue for it, I'm like yeah, that does

1150
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:46,765
Speaker 2:  make sense. And given that Izzy owns her S

1151
01:14:46,765 --> 01:14:50,645
Speaker 2:  24 plus when those trade-in deals come

1152
01:14:50,645 --> 01:14:54,325
Speaker 2:  around, yes Samsung will give you a lot of money

1153
01:14:54,785 --> 01:14:57,045
Speaker 2:  off a foldable for your S 24 plus.

1154
01:14:57,355 --> 01:14:58,605
Speaker 11:  Very good point, yeah, yeah,

1155
01:14:58,605 --> 01:15:01,845
Speaker 2:  Keep an eye on those that will really take the sting out of

1156
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:05,805
Speaker 2:  the price because they are super expensive.

1157
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:10,085
Speaker 2:  But yeah, I think would be a lot of fun for that use case. And when you're

1158
01:15:10,085 --> 01:15:12,525
Speaker 2:  done reading you can just close it and that feels great.

1159
01:15:14,225 --> 01:15:16,845
Speaker 2:  So all right Izzy, I'm sorry we,

1160
01:15:17,945 --> 01:15:21,925
Speaker 2:  you're resigned to spending $1,500 but that's what we, that's what we

1161
01:15:21,925 --> 01:15:24,365
Speaker 2:  decided here in phone court

1162
01:15:25,675 --> 01:15:29,445
Speaker 2:  legally binding. Alright, so next

1163
01:15:29,585 --> 01:15:33,045
Speaker 2:  up we have a question from Sam and

1164
01:15:33,435 --> 01:15:36,525
Speaker 2:  also gonna kind of paraphrase this. So Sam

1165
01:15:37,225 --> 01:15:40,525
Speaker 2:  had an iPhone 13 pro, got sick of it and then

1166
01:15:40,655 --> 01:15:44,485
Speaker 2:  downgraded to the iPhone SE two to hang onto that

1167
01:15:44,485 --> 01:15:48,045
Speaker 2:  home button and, but is struggling

1168
01:15:48,395 --> 01:15:50,765
Speaker 2:  with the common complaints of

1169
01:15:52,285 --> 01:15:56,005
Speaker 2:  spending too much time on social media and wanting

1170
01:15:56,105 --> 01:15:59,845
Speaker 2:  access to like texting, email, calling podcasts, all that stuff,

1171
01:16:00,425 --> 01:16:03,845
Speaker 2:  but has a hard time kind of moderating the

1172
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:08,525
Speaker 2:  social media and screen time. So Sam is looking

1173
01:16:08,715 --> 01:16:12,245
Speaker 2:  into dumb phones and thought about getting a flip phone

1174
01:16:12,505 --> 01:16:16,445
Speaker 2:  or the light phone but hesitated because they might not have

1175
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:20,485
Speaker 2:  enough of the functionality. Spent some time with the Uni Hertz

1176
01:16:20,525 --> 01:16:24,125
Speaker 2:  Jelly Star, which we've kind of touched on ertz a couple times, but

1177
01:16:24,515 --> 01:16:28,245
Speaker 2:  android phones that really lean into the, the hardware of

1178
01:16:28,245 --> 01:16:31,725
Speaker 2:  like minimalism and it sounds like

1179
01:16:32,265 --> 01:16:36,245
Speaker 2:  it was too small and her eyes started hurting from reading the

1180
01:16:36,245 --> 01:16:40,085
Speaker 2:  small text on the small screen. She says I mostly use

1181
01:16:40,085 --> 01:16:43,525
Speaker 2:  text and email on it so it wasn't putting too much of a strain on my eyes,

1182
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:47,485
Speaker 2:  but my one vice was reading the news on the tiny screen And I think

1183
01:16:47,485 --> 01:16:51,165
Speaker 2:  that's what strained my eyes the most. I am sorry to hear that.

1184
01:16:51,665 --> 01:16:55,325
Speaker 2:  So has switched back to the SE two but is missing a

1185
01:16:55,475 --> 01:16:59,405
Speaker 2:  tiny phone, so, oh my gosh Sam, you've been

1186
01:16:59,405 --> 01:17:02,525
Speaker 2:  on a journey, a journey that brought you to Uni Hertz and back.

1187
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:06,285
Speaker 11:  I'm so sad that we finally have someone who like did go out and get the

1188
01:17:06,285 --> 01:17:10,165
Speaker 11:  small phone, the smallest small phone, the one everyone says they want

1189
01:17:10,465 --> 01:17:13,605
Speaker 11:  and it made her eyes hurt and now she's having to find a bigger phone. Yeah,

1190
01:17:13,845 --> 01:17:17,765
Speaker 2:  I know. No, yeah, that's a

1191
01:17:17,765 --> 01:17:21,445
Speaker 2:  real bummer. Yeah, I own an iPhone 13 mini. I love it.

1192
01:17:21,665 --> 01:17:25,485
Speaker 2:  I'm not parting with it until it's a security risk. I don't think I'd recommend

1193
01:17:25,485 --> 01:17:29,445
Speaker 2:  someone go buy one secondhand at this point. Yeah, we're we're

1194
01:17:29,445 --> 01:17:33,285
Speaker 2:  gonna talk a little bit more specifically about that, but there is the,

1195
01:17:33,425 --> 01:17:36,805
Speaker 2:  you know, the battery life is not gonna be super great at this point.

1196
01:17:37,825 --> 01:17:41,485
Speaker 2:  So the, the one suggestion I'll throw in here is that

1197
01:17:41,935 --> 01:17:45,485
Speaker 2:  maybe the answer is a cellular

1198
01:17:45,975 --> 01:17:46,965
Speaker 2:  watch because

1199
01:17:48,555 --> 01:17:52,485
Speaker 2:  this is an experiment I just ran, you know, try Jelly, see how much

1200
01:17:52,525 --> 01:17:56,445
Speaker 2:  I could get away with doing on the watch as kind of a minimalist

1201
01:17:56,695 --> 01:18:00,605
Speaker 2:  phone or like a, a phone replacement And I

1202
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:04,125
Speaker 2:  had a little bit of trouble, you know, getting everything done with a watch,

1203
01:18:04,465 --> 01:18:08,045
Speaker 2:  but it gives you a surprising amount of functionality. You can

1204
01:18:08,435 --> 01:18:12,325
Speaker 2:  play your podcast, you can type messages to people and

1205
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:16,165
Speaker 2:  it's a little fiddly but it's not the worst. So I would throw

1206
01:18:16,165 --> 01:18:20,045
Speaker 2:  that in as an option. It, it sounds counterintuitive, you're like

1207
01:18:20,755 --> 01:18:24,325
Speaker 2:  more screens and more notifications like

1208
01:18:24,355 --> 01:18:27,725
Speaker 2:  buzzing me, won't that be more distracting? But

1209
01:18:28,345 --> 01:18:32,125
Speaker 2:  I'm kind of a believer so that's the one I'll throw in there. D Dom, do you

1210
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:34,125
Speaker 2:  have a, an idea here for Sam?

1211
01:18:34,965 --> 01:18:38,725
Speaker 11:  I have a different suggestion but it's kind of along the same spirit, which

1212
01:18:38,725 --> 01:18:42,485
Speaker 11:  would be looking at a, a foldable flip phone, which also is adding

1213
01:18:42,505 --> 01:18:46,325
Speaker 11:  an extra screen into the mix and adding a smaller screen into the mix. But

1214
01:18:46,325 --> 01:18:49,925
Speaker 11:  it sounds like the balance, I think Sam is try Jelly Strike here

1215
01:18:50,545 --> 01:18:54,525
Speaker 11:  is a small phone she won't use too much that will sort of stop her

1216
01:18:54,675 --> 01:18:58,485
Speaker 11:  from constant phone use. But one that when they do

1217
01:18:58,485 --> 01:19:02,365
Speaker 11:  use the phone won't hurt her eyes. And I

1218
01:19:02,365 --> 01:19:05,965
Speaker 11:  guess a flip phone for me like there, you know, so Samsung's Z Flip or Motor

1219
01:19:05,975 --> 01:19:09,845
Speaker 11:  Razor gives you a little of that because you can have it

1220
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:13,805
Speaker 11:  shut and you can kind of control what notifications and what apps you

1221
01:19:13,805 --> 01:19:17,365
Speaker 11:  can have run on the outer screen and it can be this sort of minimalist phone

1222
01:19:17,365 --> 01:19:21,085
Speaker 11:  experience when it's closed and you just, I definitely found

1223
01:19:21,185 --> 01:19:24,445
Speaker 11:  my general screen time always goes down when I'm using a flip phone.

1224
01:19:25,085 --> 01:19:28,765
Speaker 11:  There's something about the psychological barrier

1225
01:19:28,795 --> 01:19:32,725
Speaker 11:  that the phone is closed that makes me much less likely to

1226
01:19:32,955 --> 01:19:36,805
Speaker 11:  open it while I'm watching TV and mindlessly scroll social media or

1227
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:39,885
Speaker 11:  something. It doesn't matter that it only takes a second to open the phone.

1228
01:19:40,245 --> 01:19:43,685
Speaker 11:  It's not like it's a hardship, but there's some like imperceptible barrier

1229
01:19:43,685 --> 01:19:47,445
Speaker 11:  that makes me more likely just leave it be. And my screen time

1230
01:19:47,445 --> 01:19:51,045
Speaker 11:  overall definitely goes down. But when you do have that

1231
01:19:51,105 --> 01:19:54,165
Speaker 11:  moment where you give in, you have the device and you wanna scroll the news

1232
01:19:54,265 --> 01:19:57,965
Speaker 11:  for hours like, like Sam does, you have a normal sized phone that you can

1233
01:19:57,965 --> 01:20:01,725
Speaker 11:  open up and it's not gonna give eye strain from using it.

1234
01:20:02,245 --> 01:20:05,005
Speaker 11:  You know, there's enough screen space to bump the tech size off if that

1235
01:20:05,005 --> 01:20:07,805
Speaker 11:  would be helpful in this kind of case. Whereas the Jelly Star I think is

1236
01:20:07,805 --> 01:20:11,685
Speaker 11:  just too small to even make that really practical. So for me I

1237
01:20:11,685 --> 01:20:14,045
Speaker 11:  think those kind of, those kind of flip phones give you a bit of the best

1238
01:20:14,045 --> 01:20:17,885
Speaker 11:  of both worlds lowered screen time, but a real functional

1239
01:20:17,905 --> 01:20:20,085
Speaker 11:  useful phone screen when you wanna get to it.

1240
01:20:20,395 --> 01:20:24,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah, totally. And I, that's what I love about a flip

1241
01:20:24,295 --> 01:20:28,205
Speaker 2:  phone is you can do so much and Motorola is

1242
01:20:28,205 --> 01:20:32,045
Speaker 2:  like slightly better about letting you just do whatever the hell you want

1243
01:20:32,105 --> 01:20:35,965
Speaker 2:  on the cover screen. You have to jump through a, a couple of hoops on a Samsung

1244
01:20:36,015 --> 01:20:39,725
Speaker 2:  phone but, and you can get there. But yeah, I run like

1245
01:20:40,395 --> 01:20:44,165
Speaker 2:  apps that are by no means meant to be run on a screen that

1246
01:20:44,165 --> 01:20:47,845
Speaker 2:  small and you can get away with stuff like checking like bus

1247
01:20:47,845 --> 01:20:51,805
Speaker 2:  arrival times or glancing at, you know, Google Maps and being

1248
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:55,565
Speaker 2:  like, okay, that's, that's my next move. So that would be a, a super

1249
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:59,405
Speaker 2:  fun option. I hate to be like, I don't know a mom,

1250
01:20:59,705 --> 01:21:03,605
Speaker 2:  but I think we probably all need to get better about

1251
01:21:03,605 --> 01:21:07,405
Speaker 2:  focus modes. Like yeah, you know, they're not

1252
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:11,325
Speaker 2:  perfect but I think there's a lot I know I could

1253
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:15,005
Speaker 2:  be doing to kind of like tailor what

1254
01:21:15,005 --> 01:21:18,965
Speaker 2:  notifications are allowed to bother me at what time and that would help

1255
01:21:19,065 --> 01:21:23,045
Speaker 2:  me kind of cut down on the, oh I was checking

1256
01:21:23,705 --> 01:21:27,165
Speaker 2:  my email and all of a sudden I've been on Instagram for an hour or whatever.

1257
01:21:27,705 --> 01:21:31,685
Speaker 2:  So that's like the less fun answer. But yeah,

1258
01:21:31,705 --> 01:21:32,365
Speaker 2:  buy a flip phone

1259
01:21:32,365 --> 01:21:35,205
Speaker 11:  That is part of it. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I think you And I both given kind

1260
01:21:35,205 --> 01:21:38,925
Speaker 11:  of the same answer in a way. It it's have a real phone

1261
01:21:38,925 --> 01:21:42,765
Speaker 11:  maybe but have some other smaller screen that you

1262
01:21:42,765 --> 01:21:46,525
Speaker 11:  can control and limit and make that the screen you use 80% of the time

1263
01:21:47,055 --> 01:21:50,365
Speaker 11:  while knowing, you know, there is a phone there when you really, really

1264
01:21:50,365 --> 01:21:53,685
Speaker 11:  need it and whether that smaller screen is on your wrist or on the outside

1265
01:21:53,685 --> 01:21:55,965
Speaker 11:  of the phone, it's kind of getting, getting to the same end result, right?

1266
01:21:56,155 --> 01:21:56,445
Speaker 11:  Yeah.

1267
01:21:56,665 --> 01:22:00,565
Speaker 2:  Little screen on a big phone is the way

1268
01:22:00,565 --> 01:22:04,365
Speaker 2:  to go I think. All right, good luck with your flip phone Sam.

1269
01:22:05,355 --> 01:22:08,205
Speaker 2:  Next we have a message from Alina

1270
01:22:09,145 --> 01:22:13,045
Speaker 2:  and she says, currently I'm rocking a Pixel six a

1271
01:22:13,045 --> 01:22:16,965
Speaker 2:  running Graphene os, but it was already used when

1272
01:22:17,085 --> 01:22:20,965
Speaker 2:  I bought it. The screen glass is broken, it has 128 gigabytes of storage

1273
01:22:21,665 --> 01:22:25,565
Speaker 2:  and the touch gestures don't always work probably due to the broken glass.

1274
01:22:26,115 --> 01:22:30,045
Speaker 2:  Okay, I think it's time for a new phone a you know, is she's concerned

1275
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:33,765
Speaker 2:  about a splash of water destroying the ole and is looking for

1276
01:22:33,925 --> 01:22:37,725
Speaker 2:  a relatively cheap phone that meets her

1277
01:22:37,725 --> 01:22:41,525
Speaker 2:  needs. She says she wants to keep it to $500 or

1278
01:22:41,525 --> 01:22:45,445
Speaker 2:  under, you know, it has some questions about the

1279
01:22:45,445 --> 01:22:49,285
Speaker 2:  Apple ecosystem. The iPhone Mini comes up again as, as

1280
01:22:49,405 --> 01:22:53,005
Speaker 2:  a a thought here she says I have all my music as

1281
01:22:53,265 --> 01:22:56,965
Speaker 2:  MP threes and use a music player that plays locally stored

1282
01:22:57,055 --> 01:23:00,845
Speaker 2:  music, which is 40 gigabytes of stuff, but like

1283
01:23:01,025 --> 01:23:04,525
Speaker 2:  way to Go is intrigued by folding phones and

1284
01:23:05,045 --> 01:23:08,685
Speaker 2:  a flip phone potentially. I think the boring

1285
01:23:08,865 --> 01:23:12,845
Speaker 2:  answer is a Pixel nine A And I do

1286
01:23:12,845 --> 01:23:16,485
Speaker 2:  think there's a fun answer here, but I mean the Pixel nine A fits

1287
01:23:16,705 --> 01:23:20,405
Speaker 2:  the price bracket. We'll get seven years of OS

1288
01:23:20,405 --> 01:23:24,005
Speaker 2:  updates so you don't have to worry about that. It does mean you are

1289
01:23:24,275 --> 01:23:28,085
Speaker 2:  embracing the Google apps and the Google experience. So

1290
01:23:28,865 --> 01:23:32,845
Speaker 2:  if you would like to get away from that, a pixel phone is not gonna be

1291
01:23:33,385 --> 01:23:37,045
Speaker 2:  the way to go. But I think really for it's,

1292
01:23:37,115 --> 01:23:41,045
Speaker 2:  it's just my go-to for, I want the

1293
01:23:41,045 --> 01:23:44,885
Speaker 2:  most durable, the most long lasting phone

1294
01:23:45,045 --> 01:23:48,885
Speaker 2:  I can get for the least amount of money. It's kind of that like

1295
01:23:49,335 --> 01:23:53,205
Speaker 2:  peace of mind phone to me. Like I make my parents buy

1296
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:57,245
Speaker 2:  a a pixel a series when it's their time. Dom, do

1297
01:23:57,245 --> 01:24:01,205
Speaker 2:  you have any other ideas or something more fun than

1298
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:03,045
Speaker 2:  my boring pixel suggestion?

1299
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:07,685
Speaker 11:  I default to the exact same boring answer. Yeah, I think this is also

1300
01:24:07,985 --> 01:24:11,525
Speaker 11:  it a fits a lot of what Alina says she wants not everything but a lot

1301
01:24:12,565 --> 01:24:16,285
Speaker 11:  b for me, the moment anyone says around 500 bucks,

1302
01:24:16,505 --> 01:24:20,325
Speaker 11:  my brain just fills in pixel nine A. Yeah, it's a very

1303
01:24:20,325 --> 01:24:23,725
Speaker 11:  good default option to be looking at around that price. I might throw in

1304
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:27,525
Speaker 11:  a a second shout out to The Fairphone, which I think is very

1305
01:24:27,725 --> 01:24:31,325
Speaker 11:  slightly outside of this budget. I I think it's 550 Euros

1306
01:24:32,225 --> 01:24:35,525
Speaker 11:  and Alina says she's in Germany so I hope that's a relevant number for her.

1307
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:39,445
Speaker 11:  But she mentions not wanting kind of too much of the Google side. You, you

1308
01:24:39,445 --> 01:24:42,965
Speaker 11:  can get the version running EOS you can get that in Europe as well. So that's

1309
01:24:42,965 --> 01:24:46,445
Speaker 11:  completely degod as an option. She mentions a long,

1310
01:24:46,445 --> 01:24:50,125
Speaker 11:  long-term support and durability. I think it's eight years of

1311
01:24:50,265 --> 01:24:53,045
Speaker 11:  os updates Fair fund gives you, it's something definitely in that region.

1312
01:24:53,145 --> 01:24:57,085
Speaker 11:  So you're getting it for a long time. It's around the right price. She says

1313
01:24:57,085 --> 01:25:00,485
Speaker 11:  she doesn't doesn't seem to have sort of two super demanding kind of performance

1314
01:25:00,485 --> 01:25:04,405
Speaker 11:  requirements from it. So a Fairphone might be a nice option just for, for

1315
01:25:04,405 --> 01:25:07,925
Speaker 11:  meeting kind of that side of, of the demand and, and it really is gonna

1316
01:25:07,925 --> 01:25:10,765
Speaker 11:  give you that, that longevity and, and if you do break the screen again,

1317
01:25:10,765 --> 01:25:12,045
Speaker 11:  you can just replace it yourself.

1318
01:25:12,665 --> 01:25:14,765
Speaker 2:  Hey, it can be done. We know.

1319
01:25:15,155 --> 01:25:16,805
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I've, I've, I've put that to the test.

1320
01:25:18,785 --> 01:25:22,645
Speaker 2:  All right, well I I love that she's in Germany and therefore has more than

1321
01:25:22,645 --> 01:25:26,405
Speaker 2:  like two options for phones. But yeah, there's your

1322
01:25:26,405 --> 01:25:29,965
Speaker 2:  safe answer and then the slightly more daring one,

1323
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:33,525
Speaker 2:  but I think two good options there. So

1324
01:25:34,105 --> 01:25:37,845
Speaker 2:  the last question I wanna get to is the iPhone

1325
01:25:37,955 --> 01:25:41,365
Speaker 2:  mini question. And I wanna say this is a

1326
01:25:41,365 --> 01:25:45,205
Speaker 2:  representative question. I got so many iPhone

1327
01:25:45,205 --> 01:25:48,965
Speaker 2:  mini owners reaching out to me people at the iPhone mini 12 or 13.

1328
01:25:49,925 --> 01:25:53,725
Speaker 2:  I sort of brought this upon us because I prompted it

1329
01:25:53,945 --> 01:25:57,805
Speaker 2:  And I own an iPhone 13 mini, but I think a lot

1330
01:25:57,805 --> 01:26:01,445
Speaker 2:  of people are at that point with these phones where they're seeing

1331
01:26:01,515 --> 01:26:05,045
Speaker 2:  like the performance is slowing down, the battery

1332
01:26:05,235 --> 01:26:08,525
Speaker 2:  life wasn't ever great to begin with and is getting

1333
01:26:09,085 --> 01:26:12,845
Speaker 2:  steadily worse. So thi this is for everyone

1334
01:26:13,025 --> 01:26:17,005
Speaker 2:  who wrote in with the iPhone mini question and okay, get ready

1335
01:26:17,225 --> 01:26:21,125
Speaker 2:  for this question 'cause it goes on a journey. This is from

1336
01:26:21,225 --> 01:26:25,045
Speaker 2:  Zoe. She says, I am the iPhone 12 mini

1337
01:26:25,095 --> 01:26:29,045
Speaker 2:  owner. I absolutely love this phone and would take it to my grave if I could.

1338
01:26:29,595 --> 01:26:33,445
Speaker 2:  Same. It's the only phone since iPhone five five

1339
01:26:33,885 --> 01:26:37,685
Speaker 2:  s an original se. Oh my god, iPhone five is such a banger

1340
01:26:38,395 --> 01:26:42,365
Speaker 2:  that I can comfortably use one handed and the only one that fits

1341
01:26:42,365 --> 01:26:46,285
Speaker 2:  in the infuriatingly Tiny Pockets found in most women's clothing. Yes.

1342
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:50,525
Speaker 2:  Oh my god, I so feel this. She says last year it

1343
01:26:50,595 --> 01:26:54,245
Speaker 2:  flew out of my pocket on a rollercoaster and was smashed to

1344
01:26:54,325 --> 01:26:57,445
Speaker 2:  oblivion. This is heartbreaking.

1345
01:26:58,395 --> 01:27:01,965
Speaker 2:  Unfortunately my replacement 12 mini is now showing its age.

1346
01:27:02,505 --> 01:27:05,845
Speaker 2:  So she's looking for the upgrade path

1347
01:27:06,345 --> 01:27:10,285
Speaker 2:  and it's considered a used iPhone 13 mini, but

1348
01:27:10,865 --> 01:27:14,645
Speaker 2:  thinks that'll probably put her back in the same position. The idea of something

1349
01:27:14,645 --> 01:27:18,125
Speaker 2:  that folds down to a pocket friendly size is very appealing.

1350
01:27:18,705 --> 01:27:22,485
Speaker 2:  But she says she's embedded in the Apple ecosystem, so

1351
01:27:22,485 --> 01:27:26,325
Speaker 2:  we'll ideally stick with iPhone unless there's

1352
01:27:26,445 --> 01:27:30,085
Speaker 2:  a super compelling Android alternative she ends this with

1353
01:27:30,085 --> 01:27:33,885
Speaker 2:  finally, if there's no obvious alternative, are my tiny hands doomed to

1354
01:27:33,955 --> 01:27:37,805
Speaker 2:  rely on pops sockets forever? Oh my gosh Zoe,

1355
01:27:38,365 --> 01:27:42,205
Speaker 2:  I, this is extremely relatable. This is

1356
01:27:42,225 --> 01:27:45,725
Speaker 2:  so tough. I just wanna say it's probably time to

1357
01:27:46,315 --> 01:27:50,165
Speaker 2:  embrace like the get the smallest iPhone that exists

1358
01:27:50,425 --> 01:27:54,045
Speaker 2:  now, which would be like just a regular iPhone

1359
01:27:54,165 --> 01:27:57,885
Speaker 2:  16. But I don't know, do you have any other ideas for

1360
01:27:57,985 --> 01:28:01,245
Speaker 2:  Zoe and all the other suffering iPhone mini owners?

1361
01:28:01,995 --> 01:28:05,005
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I feel like we're sort of ending here with another of these sad questions

1362
01:28:05,005 --> 01:28:08,045
Speaker 11:  where we just can't give, give people the answer they want to hear. There

1363
01:28:08,045 --> 01:28:11,445
Speaker 11:  is no, yeah, there is no phone that solves this problem. There is no magical

1364
01:28:11,875 --> 01:28:15,645
Speaker 11:  Android alternative that fits the bill by the

1365
01:28:15,645 --> 01:28:19,485
Speaker 11:  iPhone 16 is, it's like you say, it's the smallest iPhone

1366
01:28:19,485 --> 01:28:21,965
Speaker 11:  you're gonna get. It's the closest you're gonna get to that experience.

1367
01:28:22,705 --> 01:28:26,565
Speaker 11:  The Android alternatives, like the S 25 or or the Pixel 10 are

1368
01:28:26,565 --> 01:28:30,325
Speaker 11:  basically the same size as an iPhone 16. So if you prefer iOS,

1369
01:28:30,385 --> 01:28:33,285
Speaker 11:  you should stick with that. You're not getting a big benefit by jumping

1370
01:28:33,285 --> 01:28:36,725
Speaker 11:  to Android. I think the only reason for someone in Zoe's position to jump

1371
01:28:36,725 --> 01:28:40,485
Speaker 11:  to Android is a flip phone if, if that's a temptation. I think,

1372
01:28:41,025 --> 01:28:44,005
Speaker 11:  you know, we've, we've kinda mentioned 'em a few times. I think they are

1373
01:28:44,005 --> 01:28:47,485
Speaker 11:  getting really good now. I, I'm a big fan of them. I think they don't have

1374
01:28:47,485 --> 01:28:51,445
Speaker 11:  to be that expensive. The, you look like the Motorola razor, the,

1375
01:28:51,445 --> 01:28:54,925
Speaker 11:  the base razor models, they're very affordable for what they are well below

1376
01:28:54,965 --> 01:28:58,805
Speaker 11:  a grand and still really solid phones. You do get

1377
01:28:58,805 --> 01:29:02,775
Speaker 11:  that compact size. They are big when they open up though I think

1378
01:29:02,775 --> 01:29:05,855
Speaker 11:  people don't always realize that, that they're small when they're shut,

1379
01:29:05,855 --> 01:29:08,855
Speaker 11:  they're small in your pocket, they're lightweight but they actually have

1380
01:29:08,855 --> 01:29:12,495
Speaker 11:  bigger screens than say an iPhone 16 to pick that as the point of

1381
01:29:12,655 --> 01:29:16,415
Speaker 11:  reference. So when it's fully open, it's not gonna feel like a small compact

1382
01:29:16,415 --> 01:29:20,015
Speaker 11:  phone. It might actually feel like a really big phone to you when you open

1383
01:29:20,015 --> 01:29:22,935
Speaker 11:  the flip phone up. And the last thing I'd just say is don't wait for the

1384
01:29:22,935 --> 01:29:26,295
Speaker 11:  foldable iPhone. We, we dunno what that will be. No, we dunno if it'll be

1385
01:29:26,295 --> 01:29:30,095
Speaker 11:  a flip or a book style. It's not gonna be this year. It might be

1386
01:29:30,095 --> 01:29:33,655
Speaker 11:  next year. It might not be next year. It's not worth waiting on for.

1387
01:29:33,965 --> 01:29:37,895
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I would say hold out, I think if you can to the,

1388
01:29:37,995 --> 01:29:41,215
Speaker 2:  you know, we're so close to iPhone 17

1389
01:29:41,595 --> 01:29:45,375
Speaker 2:  season and there aren rumors of like

1390
01:29:45,495 --> 01:29:48,975
Speaker 2:  a slimmer iPhone. We're we're doing slim foams

1391
01:29:49,245 --> 01:29:49,735
Speaker 2:  this year.

1392
01:29:50,555 --> 01:29:54,295
Speaker 11:  The air, the air might help if that materializes the iPhone 17 air. I mean

1393
01:29:54,915 --> 01:29:58,495
Speaker 11:  it will be lighter if the weight is a big part of the concern.

1394
01:29:58,705 --> 01:30:02,455
Speaker 11:  Right. It doesn't sound like it's gonna be smaller in terms of screen size.

1395
01:30:02,485 --> 01:30:06,015
Speaker 11:  Like, like we've seen with the Samsung, you know that, that they're the

1396
01:30:06,015 --> 01:30:09,815
Speaker 11:  version of a thin phone. The edge is, yeah, it's not small, it's just

1397
01:30:09,885 --> 01:30:13,335
Speaker 11:  thinner and lighter. Yes. And I think that's the way Apple's going as well.

1398
01:30:13,555 --> 01:30:16,975
Speaker 11:  So if weight is your problem, I know some people love small phones and it's,

1399
01:30:16,975 --> 01:30:20,415
Speaker 11:  and it's a weight thing. I've spoken to people with wrist issues and a and

1400
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,415
Speaker 11:  arthritis and for them it's not about screen size, it's about phone weight

1401
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:27,655
Speaker 11:  and if that's you then, then hold out the iPhone 17 air or

1402
01:30:27,775 --> 01:30:30,695
Speaker 11:  whatever it is, might, might solve that problem. I don't know. But if it's,

1403
01:30:30,695 --> 01:30:34,135
Speaker 11:  if it's that little screen you like and the sort of easy one-handed use,

1404
01:30:34,765 --> 01:30:38,615
Speaker 11:  then wait for the iPhone 17 just 'cause it'll make the 16 cheaper.

1405
01:30:39,485 --> 01:30:43,135
Speaker 2:  Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. At this point this is sort of like a

1406
01:30:44,145 --> 01:30:47,655
Speaker 2:  moratorium on buying new iPhones sort of starts right now where it's like,

1407
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:51,615
Speaker 2:  hey you, you might as well just wait and see, you know, they'll take a hundred

1408
01:30:51,615 --> 01:30:55,215
Speaker 2:  dollars off the price of iPhone 16. The, I

1409
01:30:55,605 --> 01:30:59,375
Speaker 2:  used the Galaxy Edge a bunch, which is, you know, In

1410
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:03,175
Speaker 2:  theory could be like what a potential iPhone 17 air

1411
01:31:03,175 --> 01:31:07,095
Speaker 2:  would be. It being thinner and lighter is like,

1412
01:31:07,095 --> 01:31:11,055
Speaker 2:  makes it feel different. It was very nice. It did not

1413
01:31:11,125 --> 01:31:14,815
Speaker 2:  feel like a small phone. 'cause it has a big screen

1414
01:31:15,395 --> 01:31:19,215
Speaker 2:  in the pocket thing, especially like it's still a big phone.

1415
01:31:19,285 --> 01:31:22,815
Speaker 2:  It's still like at the capacity for my like little

1416
01:31:23,265 --> 01:31:26,935
Speaker 2:  pouch bags that I'm bringing to the playground. It

1417
01:31:27,045 --> 01:31:30,255
Speaker 2:  will fit into a, an evening clutch,

1418
01:31:30,865 --> 01:31:34,655
Speaker 2:  which I do not carry very often, But that was a data

1419
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:38,495
Speaker 2:  point. But yeah, I think it is pops sockets forever. Zoe,

1420
01:31:38,755 --> 01:31:42,455
Speaker 2:  I'm sorry, our colleague Sean Hollister,

1421
01:31:43,215 --> 01:31:47,055
Speaker 2:  I think went through the exact same like path that

1422
01:31:47,185 --> 01:31:50,895
Speaker 2:  she's kind of mentioning. He had the iPhone mini

1423
01:31:51,445 --> 01:31:55,295
Speaker 2:  ditched it for the, I think he got a Samsung flip phone and had

1424
01:31:55,295 --> 01:31:59,285
Speaker 2:  that for about a year and was not happy with it. I, I think,

1425
01:31:59,545 --> 01:32:03,325
Speaker 2:  you know, the battery life was probably equivalent to the

1426
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:07,165
Speaker 2:  mini Yeah. You know, all things considered and it, and it

1427
01:32:07,165 --> 01:32:11,005
Speaker 2:  doesn't like it folds down into a square, but it's a thick square

1428
01:32:11,785 --> 01:32:15,485
Speaker 2:  so it, it doesn't fit in a pocket the same way. Like I can get the

1429
01:32:15,485 --> 01:32:19,365
Speaker 2:  iPhone 13 mini into my front jeans pocket and it's not

1430
01:32:19,365 --> 01:32:23,005
Speaker 2:  ridiculous. Flip phones are, they're still a little bulkier and

1431
01:32:23,115 --> 01:32:26,205
Speaker 2:  like you mentioned, when you open it, it is a big phone and you are still

1432
01:32:26,895 --> 01:32:30,605
Speaker 2:  doing the big phone, you know, kind of juggle of

1433
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:35,045
Speaker 2:  try Jelly, reach something in the corner of the screen. So yeah, I, I

1434
01:32:35,045 --> 01:32:38,885
Speaker 2:  think my general advice for the iPhone mini owners is like,

1435
01:32:39,855 --> 01:32:43,285
Speaker 2:  first of all, don't download beta software like I did because that

1436
01:32:44,585 --> 01:32:48,525
Speaker 2:  has been a journey. But you know, the things

1437
01:32:48,545 --> 01:32:52,405
Speaker 2:  you can try are like get the battery replaced. I don't

1438
01:32:52,405 --> 01:32:56,165
Speaker 2:  know if there's an, if this is a, a real thing, but a suggestion

1439
01:32:56,285 --> 01:33:00,085
Speaker 2:  I saw just for like older phones in general would be to back it up

1440
01:33:00,105 --> 01:33:03,845
Speaker 2:  and, and do a factory reset and that might

1441
01:33:04,115 --> 01:33:07,325
Speaker 2:  help performance a little bit. It's like

1442
01:33:08,005 --> 01:33:11,485
Speaker 2:  I haven't tried it myself it seems, you know, unplug it, plug it back in

1443
01:33:11,555 --> 01:33:13,365
Speaker 2:  kind of concept. Let's call

1444
01:33:13,445 --> 01:33:16,565
Speaker 11:  That energy to it. Yeah, I, yeah, I remember that working a lot on Windows

1445
01:33:17,105 --> 01:33:20,725
Speaker 11:  PCs back in the day. Yeah. I dunno how applicable it's to a phone these

1446
01:33:20,725 --> 01:33:21,805
Speaker 11:  days, but it might help. Yeah,

1447
01:33:22,215 --> 01:33:26,005
Speaker 2:  Right. It's something to try. I it is like a, like a,

1448
01:33:26,125 --> 01:33:28,765
Speaker 2:  a ritual, you know, you can light some candles too.

1449
01:33:29,185 --> 01:33:32,885
Speaker 11:  It feels like you're cleansing the phone somehow getting rid of all that

1450
01:33:32,885 --> 01:33:34,565
Speaker 11:  junk you've built up. So give it a go.

1451
01:33:35,105 --> 01:33:37,125
Speaker 2:  It is like a juice cleanse for your phone. Yeah,

1452
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:37,285
Speaker 11:  Yeah.

1453
01:33:37,405 --> 01:33:38,805
Speaker 2:  A detox. Yeah.

1454
01:33:40,315 --> 01:33:44,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I thought, I think about this a lot and it's sort

1455
01:33:44,205 --> 01:33:48,085
Speaker 2:  of just turns into a dance of like, when do you feel

1456
01:33:48,085 --> 01:33:51,845
Speaker 2:  like it's time to let go? When are you Yes. So

1457
01:33:51,845 --> 01:33:55,765
Speaker 2:  annoyed with the battery life, it's just not serving you anymore.

1458
01:33:56,725 --> 01:34:00,325
Speaker 2:  I don't use my mini that much because I'm bouncing around

1459
01:34:00,435 --> 01:34:04,325
Speaker 2:  from phone to phone. But I did have my sim in

1460
01:34:04,325 --> 01:34:08,165
Speaker 2:  it this past few weeks and it

1461
01:34:08,165 --> 01:34:12,125
Speaker 2:  is really slowing down and the battery life is, is

1462
01:34:12,195 --> 01:34:15,685
Speaker 2:  kind of crap. So yeah, it's

1463
01:34:16,335 --> 01:34:20,245
Speaker 2:  might be time. I don't know, I'm gonna hold on to mine, but I think

1464
01:34:20,645 --> 01:34:24,245
Speaker 2:  I give if, if you're looking for permission, like blanket

1465
01:34:24,255 --> 01:34:28,165
Speaker 2:  permission to let go of your iPhone mini I I will

1466
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:28,925
Speaker 2:  offer that.

1467
01:34:29,475 --> 01:34:32,605
Speaker 11:  Yeah. But there's nothing to hold out for. There's nothing on the horizon

1468
01:34:33,195 --> 01:34:37,125
Speaker 11:  that will solve this problem. Don't, don't keep going. Thinking a

1469
01:34:37,125 --> 01:34:40,325
Speaker 11:  year from now the magical firm will arrive that fixes this. Like it's not

1470
01:34:40,325 --> 01:34:44,125
Speaker 11:  coming. So just make your peace with it and you know, enjoy the time you've

1471
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:47,965
Speaker 11:  got left and yeah. Figure out what the next step is.

1472
01:34:48,715 --> 01:34:50,405
Speaker 2:  This is so sad. It's like,

1473
01:34:51,065 --> 01:34:52,765
Speaker 11:  Oh my gosh, grieve feel many, it's, it's okay.

1474
01:34:53,025 --> 01:34:56,725
Speaker 2:  You know? Yes, yes. Maybe we'll have a funeral. Maybe we can have

1475
01:34:56,795 --> 01:35:00,525
Speaker 2:  like sold some kind of service where people

1476
01:35:00,705 --> 01:35:04,645
Speaker 2:  can like bring their minis and we'll just, we'll just let them

1477
01:35:04,675 --> 01:35:08,525
Speaker 2:  rest. They've done a lot. They've, they've done probably more than

1478
01:35:08,525 --> 01:35:12,125
Speaker 2:  their little, little batteries and processors should have, so

1479
01:35:12,695 --> 01:35:16,445
Speaker 2:  we'll let them go. Well that's like a super downward

1480
01:35:17,195 --> 01:35:21,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And dawn, but that's what we have. Thank
