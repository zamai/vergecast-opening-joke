00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:06,125
Speaker 2:  Welcome To, The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Configuration Changes.

3
00:00:06,545 --> 00:00:09,765
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce and I am in my basement as always

4
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:14,125
Speaker 2:  doing a shipping day. So I'm going on vacation at the end of this week. I'm

5
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,605
Speaker 2:  gonna spend two weeks in the outdoors just like staring at trees

6
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:21,925
Speaker 2:  and not screens. It's gonna be amazing. Can't wait. But what I always try

7
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:25,085
Speaker 2:  to do before I go on vacation is just like kind of get stuff together. There's

8
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:29,045
Speaker 2:  nothing worse than coming home to like mess. So trying to

9
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:32,525
Speaker 2:  get everything cleaned off. And mostly what that means in my particular line

10
00:00:32,525 --> 00:00:36,405
Speaker 2:  of work is just shipping things. One of the great things about this

11
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:40,165
Speaker 2:  job is you accumulate a lot of gadgets and one of the annoying things about

12
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,645
Speaker 2:  this job is you have to ship them all back. So right now I have like, I have

13
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:47,605
Speaker 2:  a bunch of tablets on my desk. I have a case for a thing.

14
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:51,205
Speaker 2:  I don't even know what the thing is. I have, I have a bunch of watch boxes

15
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:52,925
Speaker 2:  that I have to go back. I see

16
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:57,045
Speaker 2:  one, two, three, four, five phones that I have

17
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:00,805
Speaker 2:  to do something with. I have some AR glasses, I have these Amazon

18
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:04,405
Speaker 2:  Echo frames. I have a camera and I have a Vision Pro

19
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:08,085
Speaker 2:  and I have, oh, that's another phone. So that's six phones. I have the humane

20
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:12,165
Speaker 2:  AI pin that I keep meaning to send back. I have two rabbits. They sent me

21
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:16,085
Speaker 2:  two for some reason. I don't know why. I don't want either one of them. So

22
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:19,805
Speaker 2:  basically what has going to happen here is I have a very carefully organized

23
00:01:19,805 --> 00:01:23,685
Speaker 2:  thing of packing tape in the utility room over there and I'm going

24
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:27,565
Speaker 2:  to spend all day shoving things into boxes and then I'm gonna

25
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:31,325
Speaker 2:  load my car and as I do four or five times a year, I'm going to

26
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,805
Speaker 2:  dump thousands of things into the UPS office

27
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:38,285
Speaker 2:  all at once. And then it's going to feel like a gigantic weight has lifted

28
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:42,285
Speaker 2:  off my shoulders. I both hate this and kind of love how it feels at the

29
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:45,925
Speaker 2:  very end. Anyway, lots to do on The Vergecast. Today

30
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:50,125
Speaker 2:  we are gonna talk about the crazy thing that happened on Friday when

31
00:01:50,265 --> 00:01:53,605
Speaker 2:  thanks to something happening with CrowdStrike and Windows

32
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:58,405
Speaker 2:  computers all over the world just went down and broke and it felt

33
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:02,325
Speaker 2:  like everything from airlines to banks just fell apart all at once. We're

34
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:06,005
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about what happened, what it means that that can happen, and where

35
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:09,845
Speaker 2:  we go from here. We're also gonna talk about one of my all time favorite

36
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:14,085
Speaker 2:  apps called Zombies Run. And we're gonna talk about what that app means

37
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:17,165
Speaker 2:  for fitness and what it gets right about how we think about

38
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:21,165
Speaker 2:  quantifying ourselves and tracking things and gamification and

39
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:25,085
Speaker 2:  everything that feels toxic and wrong with the

40
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:29,005
Speaker 2:  way that our devices work. Now, why that app feels like

41
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:32,125
Speaker 2:  none of it, we had a super fun time talking to one of the creators. It's

42
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,165
Speaker 2:  a really good interview. We also have a fun hotline question about handheld

43
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:38,405
Speaker 2:  gaming, which we've been talking a lot about on this show recently. So lots

44
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:42,165
Speaker 2:  to get to. All that is coming up in just a second. But I just this

45
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:45,725
Speaker 2:  second realized that I don't have anywhere near enough actual boxes,

46
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:50,325
Speaker 2:  which means I have to go, I think to like Home Depot and pay a bunch

47
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:54,165
Speaker 2:  of money for a bunch of boxes to then pay a bunch of money to ship

48
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:58,085
Speaker 2:  to someone else. It's a process. Anyway, this is The Vergecast.

49
00:02:58,135 --> 00:02:58,685
Speaker 2:  We'll be right

50
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:17,955
Speaker 2:  computers that didn't work. Banks were having trouble, airlines were having

51
00:04:17,955 --> 00:04:21,835
Speaker 2:  trouble. It felt like all at once, the whole world just kind of

52
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:26,075
Speaker 2:  crashed. and it turns out this was something that happened because of a company

53
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:29,995
Speaker 2:  called CrowdStrike on Windows computers. and it, it has made a lot

54
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:33,915
Speaker 2:  of people feel a lot of feelings about what it means that

55
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:37,435
Speaker 2:  we are so reliant on technology and not just technology, but very

56
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:42,235
Speaker 2:  specific things from very specific companies. And all of it

57
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:46,035
Speaker 2:  feels so important and infrastructural, but it all also feels fragile.

58
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:50,315
Speaker 2:  So I wanna talk about what has happened over the last few days, what we've

59
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:54,155
Speaker 2:  learned and where we might go forward in how we think about

60
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:58,195
Speaker 2:  computers and how we use them for the most important things going on in the

61
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:01,595
Speaker 2:  world. Tom Warren on our team has been covering all of this all weekend,

62
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:05,235
Speaker 2:  I think didn't have a weekend by the sounds of things, so we're gonna get

63
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:06,075
Speaker 2:  into it. Hi Tom.

64
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:07,755
Speaker 4:  Hey, good to be back. So

65
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:11,515
Speaker 2:  You have like an ITish background a little bit. Is this like the confluence

66
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:13,315
Speaker 2:  of all of your interests these last few days?

67
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:17,195
Speaker 4:  Yeah, this, this is like, I'm so glad I got out of it more

68
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:20,715
Speaker 4:  than a decade ago, kind of a incident. Yeah, definitely.

69
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:21,195
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

70
00:05:21,215 --> 00:05:25,195
Speaker 2:  It seems right. So let's rewind back to Friday morning. You're in the

71
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:29,155
Speaker 2:  uk, I'm in the us So you woke up a few hours earlier

72
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:33,115
Speaker 2:  than I did and got online. Like describe to me the scenes

73
00:05:33,255 --> 00:05:35,915
Speaker 2:  of Friday morning as you were getting up and getting online

74
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:40,075
Speaker 4:  Chaos. No, so I woke up late around about 7:00 AM and I

75
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:43,115
Speaker 4:  had like a couple of people, one I used to work with and then just a good

76
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:46,955
Speaker 4:  friend who's like very technical messaged me saying, have you seen this

77
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:50,555
Speaker 4:  in Australia? Like, what, what's going on out there? And I was like, huh,

78
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:53,315
Speaker 4:  we'll all this. And I, I looked at like the Reddit thread. There was like

79
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:57,160
Speaker 4:  loads of cis admins complaining and usually that's a good sign of, of

80
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,765
Speaker 4:  any sort of major sort of Windows outages or, or anything

81
00:06:00,765 --> 00:06:04,605
Speaker 4:  related to that is is Reddit, people getting angry essentially.

82
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:08,725
Speaker 4:  It's a good flags. Yeah. So I saw that. And then there's

83
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:12,525
Speaker 4:  some like media reports out of Australia about banks being

84
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:16,085
Speaker 4:  affected, the supermarkets, airlines, you know, all the us the stuff that

85
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:20,005
Speaker 4:  we've seen. But then it started to spread, right? So I turned

86
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:24,005
Speaker 4:  on like the tv, you know, quarter past seven to watch like Sky News and,

87
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:27,845
Speaker 4:  and they weren't running the news and I was like, Hmm, this is weird,

88
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:31,925
Speaker 4:  huh. And then it came like one of their tech persons had tweeted saying

89
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:35,525
Speaker 4:  they were offline because some tech issues and then it started to like escalate.

90
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:39,085
Speaker 4:  It was like some of the airports warning of the initial flights that started

91
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:42,165
Speaker 4:  around about that time of the day, like 7:00 AM is kinda like the early flights

92
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:45,925
Speaker 4:  of delays and stuff. And I was like, okay, right, I've gotta figure out what's

93
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:49,205
Speaker 4:  going on here. And then obviously we saw the CrowdStrike thing and then it

94
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:53,085
Speaker 4:  all kind of just started spiraling, like you just saw more

95
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:56,605
Speaker 4:  and more. But at the same time there was a Microsoft Azure

96
00:06:56,855 --> 00:07:00,245
Speaker 4:  cloud outage going on. Oh God, I didn't even know that. It wasn't a huge

97
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:03,405
Speaker 4:  one. Yeah, it wasn't a huge one, but it was kind of small. So it started

98
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:07,205
Speaker 4:  out with like everyone blaming Microsoft basically for this outage

99
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:09,285
Speaker 4:  to start off. Yeah.

100
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:12,245
Speaker 2:  How quickly did, by the time I was online,

101
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:16,445
Speaker 2:  CrowdStrike was kind of already in the conversation. It was, yeah, there

102
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:19,565
Speaker 2:  was a lot of like, right when I became aware of the story, it was kind of

103
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,765
Speaker 2:  at that moment where it was like, okay, this is, this is a CrowdStrike thing.

104
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:26,685
Speaker 2:  We hadn't quite gotten to, here's what's going on yet. But how did, how did

105
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:30,045
Speaker 2:  folks figure out that CrowdStrike was the issue here?

106
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:34,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think mainly because on Reddit, the people that were posting there,

107
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:38,285
Speaker 4:  the CIS admins were posting the stuff from CrowdStrike's support,

108
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:41,805
Speaker 4:  which obviously had to be a CrowdStrike customer to access. It wasn't available

109
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:45,965
Speaker 4:  publicly. So then it was like, okay, this is what's actually caused it. It's

110
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,445
Speaker 4:  obviously not a Windows problem because not everyone's waking up with this,

111
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:53,485
Speaker 4:  it's like a select amount of machines, but enough to obviously be

112
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:57,405
Speaker 4:  causing a problem. and it obviously they issued this update, I think

113
00:07:57,405 --> 00:08:01,205
Speaker 4:  it was like around about like 5:00 AM UK time and then I think it was like

114
00:08:01,545 --> 00:08:05,245
Speaker 4:  an hour and 20 minutes or so near enough when they pulled it.

115
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:09,445
Speaker 4:  But that was that time when it was like middle of the afternoon or something

116
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:12,765
Speaker 4:  in Australia, like the peak time for people to all have their machines on

117
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,365
Speaker 4:  with CrowdStrike installed. And they obviously have a quite a big install

118
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:20,045
Speaker 4:  base there, I guess in Australia. So they got hit the hardest, like initially.

119
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:20,485
Speaker 4:  I,

120
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:23,925
Speaker 2:  I think about that with like you, you see the companies that do maintenance

121
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:26,885
Speaker 2:  or software updates or whatever and they always do them. It's, it's almost

122
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:30,245
Speaker 2:  always overnight in the us right? So the thing you're describing like 5:00 AM

123
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:34,645
Speaker 2:  UK time, that's middle of the night in the us Yeah. I

124
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:37,965
Speaker 2:  I, it had never occurred to me before this, but that's gotta suck if you

125
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:40,685
Speaker 2:  live in one of these timelines that is like opposite the US and all of these

126
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:44,085
Speaker 2:  things are happening in the middle of your workday. Yeah. All the time over

127
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:47,525
Speaker 2:  and over again. So like Australia just getting screwed by software updates

128
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,285
Speaker 2:  left and right here. I never really thought about that for, I'm sorry, Australia,

129
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:54,285
Speaker 4:  I think they got hit the hardest because I think just all the machines were

130
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:57,965
Speaker 4:  online right. To, to get this update. So if, and then obviously the

131
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:01,365
Speaker 4:  European machines a a lot of these machines will be just, you know, people

132
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:04,805
Speaker 4:  leave the office, they don't turn 'em off for example. These are also

133
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:08,245
Speaker 4:  critical systems that this is usually installed on. So they're probably pretty

134
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:11,925
Speaker 4:  much always online. So that's why there was like 8.5 million

135
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:15,965
Speaker 4:  machines in total affected. We saw some, I feel like there was less in

136
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:19,645
Speaker 4:  the US affected in terms of like the stuff that we saw in Australia, like

137
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:23,125
Speaker 4:  the supermarkets and people not being able to get groceries and you know,

138
00:09:23,385 --> 00:09:26,445
Speaker 4:  all those like affecting hospital appointments and stuff. I think there was

139
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:29,125
Speaker 4:  a little bit less of that in the us The

140
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,525
Speaker 2:  Biggest thing that happened in the US at least anecdotally was the airline

141
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:32,925
Speaker 2:  stuff.

142
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:33,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah. And then

143
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:36,365
Speaker 2:  There was, and that's still ongoing. The graphs that you could see of the

144
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:39,565
Speaker 2:  planes in the sky was pretty Yeah. Incredible for a few hours,

145
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:43,685
Speaker 4:  Which usually only happens like they grind. Yeah, they ground, sorry, that

146
00:09:43,685 --> 00:09:46,965
Speaker 4:  many flights usually when it's less something terrible happens, right?

147
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:51,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But that's still ongoing. I think Delta actually said

148
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:55,125
Speaker 4:  yesterday they're still canceling flights Oh wow. And canceling some today.

149
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:59,725
Speaker 4:  So that's, I think they've been particularly like worse hit than, than

150
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:03,205
Speaker 4:  the other major sort of airlines in the US but Okay. Yeah. So that's still,

151
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:04,765
Speaker 4:  there's still a bit of a fallout going on there. Yeah.

152
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:08,245
Speaker 2:  So with a few days of hindsight, it seems like we have a pretty clear sense

153
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:11,565
Speaker 2:  of what happened. So just back all the way up, like what, what happened here?

154
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:14,925
Speaker 2:  What broke? And I guess start with who is CrowdStrike because I think most

155
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:18,685
Speaker 2:  people reasonably do not and should not have to know Yeah, sure. Who

156
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,885
Speaker 2:  CrowdStrike is. So like start all the way at the beginning, what went wrong

157
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:21,045
Speaker 2:  here?

158
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:23,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They're probably, the only time you've ever heard of CrowdStrike is,

159
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:27,485
Speaker 4:  is that they sponsor Mercedes s like you watch Formula One then

160
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:28,165
Speaker 4:  maybe, wait,

161
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:31,285
Speaker 2:  I knew I had heard that name before. That's so funny. Okay. That's right.

162
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:31,765
Speaker 2:  That, yeah,

163
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:35,565
Speaker 4:  Go. and it was that picture of the, the Windows machines that had crashed

164
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:38,925
Speaker 4:  at the Mercedes F1 garage. Yep. When they, when they're doing the testing

165
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:42,165
Speaker 4:  and they had CrowdStrike on the T-shirts, it's like, it's just perfect. But

166
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:45,765
Speaker 4:  yeah, on Friday morning CrowdStrike issued what they call

167
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:49,805
Speaker 4:  like a content update to their protection system. And CrowdStrike is

168
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:53,645
Speaker 4:  a third party security firm that just think of it

169
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:56,965
Speaker 4:  basically as antivirus essentially. It's a lot more sophisticated than that

170
00:10:57,205 --> 00:11:00,805
Speaker 4:  because obviously cybersecurity these days is, is advanced further, but it's,

171
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:04,605
Speaker 4:  it's a cloud-based solution that pushes updates to machines

172
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:08,085
Speaker 4:  that pay for this software. And I think it's around about 50 bucks a machine.

173
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,605
Speaker 4:  So it's not cheap like to, to protect your, your system with, with this stuff.

174
00:11:12,225 --> 00:11:15,645
Speaker 4:  So it's usually on critical systems. So that's why

175
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:18,885
Speaker 4:  you saw such an impact, but yeah. And do you mean

176
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:22,605
Speaker 2:  Critical systems in the sense of like super secure government

177
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:26,205
Speaker 2:  computers or just like computers that can't afford to go down or I guess

178
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:26,485
Speaker 2:  both.

179
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:30,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. More, more, more computers that can't really afford to go down. Okay.

180
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:34,285
Speaker 4:  Like you see in the, all the airport screens were all Windows machines and

181
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:38,245
Speaker 4:  they're kind of critical for communications to passengers and stuff. So it's

182
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:42,005
Speaker 4:  not, not critical in the security side potentially, but

183
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:46,205
Speaker 4:  more the infrastructure side. Got it. Of of things. Yeah. So

184
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,805
Speaker 4:  yeah, they issued a, a regular update, I think it was about 5:00 AM

185
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:53,965
Speaker 4:  UK time around about then, which is about midnight eastern.

186
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:57,965
Speaker 4:  And then all the machines started collecting that update because

187
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:01,845
Speaker 4:  that is the way that this system is designed so that you get these

188
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:05,725
Speaker 4:  updates so you are protected against any emerging threats. Right. Like

189
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,245
Speaker 4:  you'll get Right.

190
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:08,685
Speaker 2:  And it's not like a button you have to click on the computer to update. Like,

191
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:11,525
Speaker 2:  this is one thing I think I've, I've heard some folks having trouble understanding

192
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:15,445
Speaker 2:  like, this is not an update that appears and you click a thing and

193
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:19,005
Speaker 2:  your computer reboots No, this is like, and it's designed to happen in the

194
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,605
Speaker 2:  background all the time, right? Yeah. Like this is the kind of update CrowdStrike

195
00:12:21,605 --> 00:12:23,525
Speaker 2:  does constantly, if I understand. Yeah.

196
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,965
Speaker 4:  It does these like if not hourly, like daily. Okay. You know, like

197
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,285
Speaker 4:  these are pre frequent updates. So the way that the system works,

198
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:35,005
Speaker 4:  let's explain that first is that it runs at the very like highest level

199
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:39,045
Speaker 4:  of windows. So basically in the kernel, which is like a privileged area of

200
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:42,845
Speaker 4:  Windows that most apps don't touch or, or go near, it's like your

201
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,725
Speaker 4:  anti sheet systems for PC games or, or see this

202
00:12:46,795 --> 00:12:50,605
Speaker 4:  sort of security scanning software is allowed in there. And, and

203
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:54,685
Speaker 4:  Microsoft allows that. And so they have a driver that

204
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:57,845
Speaker 4:  runs at the boot of Windows to protect the system.

205
00:12:58,505 --> 00:13:01,685
Speaker 4:  And then they have these content delivery updates that are sort of like the

206
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:05,525
Speaker 4:  rules and regulations around how this driver functions and

207
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:09,125
Speaker 4:  how it detects stuff. And it's that sort of update, not the driver

208
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:12,685
Speaker 4:  that caused the issues. and it was basically a corruption in the update.

209
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:16,805
Speaker 4:  And then the, the driver's obviously gone, oh no, what's happening? Crashed.

210
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:20,525
Speaker 4:  And then Windows has gone, oh no, what's happening Blue screen and then

211
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:24,405
Speaker 4:  reboot. And then it keeps doing that every time because it keeps reading

212
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:28,365
Speaker 4:  that the latest content update. And so they, they, they've managed to fix

213
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:32,325
Speaker 4:  it on some machines because You can keep rebooting the machine and

214
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:36,045
Speaker 4:  if you're lucky the network stack will initialize in Windows before

215
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:39,805
Speaker 4:  CrowdStrike does. And then you get the update or CrowdStrike starts, its

216
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:43,365
Speaker 4:  like scanning. So you get the update the latest like dictionary

217
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,725
Speaker 4:  definitions essentially before it crashes. So,

218
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:49,845
Speaker 4:  so some have been able to recover from that. I'm not, I'm not sure what the

219
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:53,805
Speaker 4:  percentage is 'cause CrowdStrike haven't really sort of detailed that and

220
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:57,725
Speaker 4:  they're also working on some sort of other remediation, some mysterious

221
00:13:57,725 --> 00:14:01,325
Speaker 4:  remediation that they've been testing apparently over the last 24 hours.

222
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:04,725
Speaker 4:  So may maybe we get some more details about that. But that's essentially

223
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:07,685
Speaker 4:  what happened. It was like 78 minutes of

224
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:11,645
Speaker 4:  push this faulty update out to machines and obviously there was a bunch of

225
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:14,965
Speaker 4:  them that are virtual machines. There's servers, there's just machines that

226
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:17,485
Speaker 4:  are always on, like we were talking about the airport and stuff. So they

227
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:20,685
Speaker 4:  were just sort of grabbed it. If you obviously had a machine that you turned

228
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:24,005
Speaker 4:  on once they pulled the bad update, you wouldn't have been affected. But

229
00:14:24,005 --> 00:14:27,885
Speaker 4:  it still hit 8.5 million devices, which sounds like a lot as well.

230
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:31,645
Speaker 4:  and it is, but Microsoft's point is like, it's one less than 1%

231
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:35,645
Speaker 4:  of Windows machines. But but it's the, it's the important part of

232
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:36,325
Speaker 4:  Windows machines. Yeah.

233
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:38,925
Speaker 2:  Let's let's talk through that. Yeah. That's the thing, right? I think it's

234
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:42,685
Speaker 2:  like the percentage of Microsoft

235
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:46,845
Speaker 2:  computers that have CrowdStrike is by definition going to be a very low important

236
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:50,565
Speaker 2:  percentage of Microsoft PCs. Right. And those matter

237
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:54,565
Speaker 2:  a lot that they keep running. So this idea that like, you know, the the surface

238
00:14:54,785 --> 00:14:58,725
Speaker 2:  laptop my wife has in her office upstairs didn't crash. It's like, I

239
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:01,285
Speaker 2:  don't know if that's the victory for Microsoft that we're hoping for. No,

240
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:05,005
Speaker 2:  but it is useful perspective. It didn't Yeah. And I think Microsoft is trying

241
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,805
Speaker 2:  desperately to say like, this isn't Windows. Like we didn't, this is not

242
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:09,845
Speaker 2:  a Windows problem. We didn't do it. Yeah,

243
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:13,605
Speaker 4:  Definitely. But can you imagine if it had been 10%, like

244
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:14,405
Speaker 2:  I know

245
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,365
Speaker 4:  It, it could have been like even like a lot, a lot, lot worse. Yeah,

246
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:22,125
Speaker 4:  it was obviously very bad, but yeah, I'm just, yeah, it's,

247
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:25,805
Speaker 4:  it, it could have been really bad. So, and it just kind of shows you

248
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:28,405
Speaker 4:  like the reliance on this stuff. So

249
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:31,925
Speaker 2:  You've been tracking kind of the different versions of the fix that have

250
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:34,805
Speaker 2:  been going on here because I think Yes. Walk me through kind of where we've

251
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:37,645
Speaker 2:  been. 'cause at the very beginning, if I remember right, one of the big problems

252
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:41,645
Speaker 2:  was the fix was super manual. You had to like go into every

253
00:15:41,645 --> 00:15:45,485
Speaker 2:  airport, kiosk, computer, reboot it in safe mode,

254
00:15:45,865 --> 00:15:49,325
Speaker 2:  do a thing, do another thing, and then it would work again. And it's like,

255
00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:53,645
Speaker 2:  fine for your computer at home, but that doesn't work for every

256
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:57,005
Speaker 2:  airline and airport and bank around the world. Like that's just not a good,

257
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:59,965
Speaker 2:  yeah. So, but it seems like it, even just a few days later, there's a much

258
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:02,845
Speaker 2:  better track for getting this stuff fixed. So walk me through that a little

259
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:02,965
Speaker 2:  bit.

260
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:06,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Kind of yes and no because obviously we talked about the reboot thing

261
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:09,965
Speaker 4:  is what CrowdStrike's been recommended and that's, that's, that's working

262
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:10,485
Speaker 4:  on some,

263
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:13,685
Speaker 2:  What were you saying up to 15 times you wrote? Right. Just basically keep

264
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:14,605
Speaker 2:  turning it off and on again until

265
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:16,565
Speaker 4:  Something it happens. Apparently you just keep rebooting and that's, that's

266
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:19,245
Speaker 4:  working for some people. It's not working for everyone. So there's still

267
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,965
Speaker 4:  a lot of manual intervention going on. So you still have the option

268
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,365
Speaker 4:  of doing it manually where you, you'd have to start the machine in safe mode,

269
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:30,085
Speaker 4:  which requires physical access and a keyboard to to, to, you know, get this

270
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:33,445
Speaker 4:  machine to, to go in safe mode and then you need admin rights to actually

271
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:37,365
Speaker 4:  delete the 40 file. So there's quite a lot of, you know, a

272
00:16:37,365 --> 00:16:40,805
Speaker 4:  lot of intervention there. It's not like just send an update, click, click

273
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:44,245
Speaker 4:  a button and update is, is there. The other option is Microsoft

274
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:48,645
Speaker 4:  create a recovery tool which can sort of automate that process.

275
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:52,125
Speaker 4:  But the only problem is a lot of these machines, 'cause they're critical

276
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:56,085
Speaker 4:  and, and, and they're out sort of in airports and stuff, they, they,

277
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:59,325
Speaker 4:  they might be locked, locked down by BitLocker, which is disc encryption.

278
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:03,645
Speaker 4:  So then that tool can't do that without you having a recovery key,

279
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:07,485
Speaker 4:  which are unique for every machine. And then you have to type this long,

280
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:11,125
Speaker 4:  it's long, it's like a Windows key

281
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:15,125
Speaker 4:  product key that you put in that sort of length to then allow

282
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,005
Speaker 4:  you access. So there's a lot of, there's still a lot of manual intervention

283
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:21,805
Speaker 4:  going along. We, we've seen videos and pictures of like people

284
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:25,565
Speaker 4:  scaling ladders in airports and stuff just to literally plug

285
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,685
Speaker 4:  USBs into like these machines. It's just like, it's, yeah,

286
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:33,245
Speaker 4:  there's a lot that's still going on. So I didn't, I, I'd love to know what

287
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:37,005
Speaker 4:  the percentage of ones that were fixed by rebooting multiple times

288
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:40,725
Speaker 4:  versus, you know, man manual intervention and also just

289
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:45,525
Speaker 4:  do ITM means just go and just blast this thing away and, and

290
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:49,005
Speaker 4:  make sure that machine's fixed moved on to next. You know, like it's a choice

291
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:51,565
Speaker 4:  isn't it, for, for every business as well. Do you wanna sit there trying

292
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:55,325
Speaker 4:  to reboot it or do you just wanna fix it in the amount of time that you could

293
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:59,125
Speaker 4:  have sat there rebooting it sort of 20 times? So I think it's a choice, but

294
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,965
Speaker 4:  yeah, there's some more tools and in like we said, CrowdStrike's potentially

295
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:05,805
Speaker 4:  doing something that, I can't remember the exact wording they've put on it,

296
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:09,725
Speaker 4:  but it's like some cloud-based solution

297
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:13,485
Speaker 4:  that they think they might have got this fixed somehow, but

298
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:14,805
Speaker 4:  I'm not sure how that's gonna work.

299
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:19,005
Speaker 2:  You cover Microsoft for us. Yes. I feel like over the last 72

300
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:22,605
Speaker 2:  hours this has gone from being a Microsoft disaster

301
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:27,405
Speaker 2:  to not really being a Microsoft disaster. This is, it's kind of a Microsoft

302
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:31,565
Speaker 2:  adjacent disaster I would say. Yeah. But what is your sense of, of

303
00:18:31,755 --> 00:18:35,685
Speaker 2:  what a, kind of how this looks for Microsoft and B like if

304
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:39,205
Speaker 2:  you're Microsoft and you're, you're a company that obviously is responsible

305
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:43,125
Speaker 2:  in some ways for Yeah. These kinds of crucial machines and the

306
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,485
Speaker 2:  way that these systems work. Is your sense that anything, anything changes

307
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:49,325
Speaker 2:  here? Is this just like a bad thing that happened and we all recover and

308
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:51,605
Speaker 2:  move on? Or does this feel like it might change things?

309
00:18:52,035 --> 00:18:55,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I feel like it might change things. I mean, because there, there's

310
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:58,085
Speaker 4:  a lot going on here. It is obviously CrowdStrike, which is a third party

311
00:18:58,145 --> 00:19:02,005
Speaker 4:  vendor, they get privileged access to, to be able to, to

312
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:04,085
Speaker 4:  run this software in the way they do. Right. Which

313
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:06,645
Speaker 2:  Is not normal, we should say. Like it's a pretty, it's normal, it's a big

314
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,045
Speaker 2:  thing to give somebody essentially that kind of access. Yeah. It's it's like

315
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:11,965
Speaker 2:  being inside of your computer in a very real way.

316
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:16,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And Microsoft allows it. And I

317
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:20,005
Speaker 4:  think that there was a statement where Microsoft said that essentially

318
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:24,085
Speaker 4:  that they have to give this access because of a ruling by the European Commission

319
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:28,485
Speaker 4:  in 2009, which I think is like yes,

320
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:32,365
Speaker 4:  true. But also, you know, they, they could, they could

321
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:35,845
Speaker 4:  possibly do what Apple have done and and create, create an architecture where

322
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:39,325
Speaker 4:  they have their own API set and then vendors plug into that.

323
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:43,245
Speaker 4:  But yeah, I, I don't know, I need to look into that more fully to see that,

324
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:46,645
Speaker 4:  the legalities on that. But yes, they do have to keep their kernel open

325
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:50,925
Speaker 4:  and it's essentially, it's not necessarily that they have to keep the kernel

326
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:54,445
Speaker 4:  open, it's just that they can't privilege their own security software over

327
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:57,765
Speaker 4:  other vendors seen as anti-competitive. And they've tried to lock down Windows

328
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,565
Speaker 4:  a bunch over the years Got it. To sort of secure things up. And they always

329
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:05,525
Speaker 4:  do get accused of being, you know, anti-competitive, whether it's like through

330
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:09,485
Speaker 4:  really dumb ways like ESS mode for sure. Or you know, some

331
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:13,245
Speaker 4:  more ways like TPM chips on Windows 11. Like there's always,

332
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,885
Speaker 4:  there's always gonna be a pushback because people see Windows

333
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:20,525
Speaker 4:  as this open system and they do not like it when Microsoft tries to lock

334
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:24,445
Speaker 4:  it down for whatever reasons they might be doing it. But I feel like this

335
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:28,245
Speaker 4:  might trigger some sort of change. The only thing is that

336
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:31,605
Speaker 4:  the Mac like way of doing it, it hasn't been perfect. It actually, sometimes

337
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:35,285
Speaker 4:  the security software that runs there does cause panic errors on,

338
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:39,565
Speaker 4:  on Macs. So there's no like perfect way

339
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:43,005
Speaker 4:  of doing this. And I think Microsoft was kind of stuck in this weird situation

340
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:46,445
Speaker 4:  where it's like they kind of should take some of the blame here because

341
00:20:47,065 --> 00:20:50,845
Speaker 4:  should we say if there's a driver that's faulty and it's

342
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:55,005
Speaker 4:  stopping windows from booting or or crashing it at boot, why does Windows

343
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:58,685
Speaker 4:  not unload that after it's done that, like five times or whatever, however

344
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,205
Speaker 4:  long you wanna say. But it should be intelligent enough to be like

345
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:06,085
Speaker 4:  something weird's going on here, right? because there as a human, if something

346
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:09,445
Speaker 4:  was crashing, you just stop it, wouldn't you? And be like, let's see what's

347
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:12,805
Speaker 4:  going on here. Right? But it just allows that behavior to to happen.

348
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:17,405
Speaker 4:  So I feel like they need to address some of that to, to stop this sort

349
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:20,805
Speaker 4:  of thing happening in the future as well. But again, it's not their update

350
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:24,565
Speaker 4:  so that it wasn't their fault, but they couldn't help

351
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:28,645
Speaker 4:  if you know what I mean? So Yeah. But I think it's, it's gonna trigger a

352
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:31,965
Speaker 4:  lot of conversations around this and it's just interesting because

353
00:21:31,995 --> 00:21:35,685
Speaker 4:  CrowdStrike obviously competes with Microsoft and Microsoft has its own endpoint

354
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:39,365
Speaker 4:  stuff like Intune that it sells to customers and competes with CrowdStrike

355
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:43,565
Speaker 4:  on the sales teams and the CEO of CrowdStrike regularly goes on

356
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:47,525
Speaker 4:  TV broadcasts and interviews and bashes Microsoft security record,

357
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:51,845
Speaker 4:  which obviously has not been great Yeah. Over the past few years. So

358
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:55,405
Speaker 4:  it's all, there's a lot of stuff going on here and, and I think there was

359
00:21:55,405 --> 00:21:57,805
Speaker 4:  something about how, there was an incident that happened, I think it was

360
00:21:57,805 --> 00:22:01,645
Speaker 4:  in 2010 when McAfee sent out an update similar to this and it

361
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:05,605
Speaker 4:  crashed a bunch of Windows XP machines and the CrowdStrike CEO was

362
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:09,405
Speaker 4:  the CTO at McAfee at the time. So it's like, yeah, there's, there's,

363
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:13,085
Speaker 4:  there's a lot of history between security vendors and Microsoft and

364
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:17,325
Speaker 4:  all this stuff where they, they want it to be open. Microsoft's like, yeah,

365
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:21,205
Speaker 4:  but you should trust us. I mean, everyone's like, well look what's happened,

366
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:24,965
Speaker 4:  we've trust trusted you for the past couple of decades. You know, like, so

367
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:26,925
Speaker 4:  I think there's gonna be a lot of conversations around that.

368
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:31,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean it's such an interesting microcosm of

369
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:34,165
Speaker 2:  both sides of the debate here, right? Because like, if you wanna argue for

370
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:38,445
Speaker 2:  the closed ecosystem, it's so that things like this don't happen

371
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:42,725
Speaker 2:  And if you wanna argue for the open ecosystem, it's that mostly things like

372
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:45,885
Speaker 2:  this don't happen, right? Like Yeah. Part of what's so interesting about

373
00:22:45,885 --> 00:22:49,485
Speaker 2:  this to me is it's, it is on the one hand sort of

374
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:52,805
Speaker 2:  remarkable that like the McAfee thing was in 2010 and this is this year.

375
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:56,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And these things don't actually happen all that often, and yet when

376
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:56,885
Speaker 2:  they do,

377
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:02,245
Speaker 2:  they literally like set the world on fire, right? Like

378
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:02,405
Speaker 2:  it

379
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:03,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's, it's catastrophic,

380
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:07,925
Speaker 2:  Right? And we're, we're so reliant on this stuff now, and I

381
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:10,925
Speaker 2:  think it, it comes to a point where, and like you said, nobody is perfect.

382
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:14,765
Speaker 2:  I don't think there is a version of this that is perfect and it just makes

383
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:18,005
Speaker 2:  you wonder like, okay, how do we, how do we even think about

384
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:22,405
Speaker 2:  our reliance on this stuff as people, as

385
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:26,685
Speaker 2:  businesses, as like society? Like the fact that a a what it

386
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:30,125
Speaker 2:  amounts to like a security update to your computer could prevent you from

387
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,845
Speaker 2:  flying to your vacation is just like a weird thing nobody

388
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:37,485
Speaker 2:  thinks about. And I, I, I have spent now a lot of time thinking about it

389
00:23:37,505 --> 00:23:40,445
Speaker 2:  and I still don't know how to sort through it because it's not like, get

390
00:23:40,445 --> 00:23:43,165
Speaker 2:  rid of all the computers, pen and paper will fix it. It's like that's clearly

391
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:43,845
Speaker 2:  not the answer.

392
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:47,685
Speaker 4:  But yeah. And I've seen seen some people tweet like

393
00:23:48,735 --> 00:23:52,645
Speaker 4:  maybe people should, should use end points in, in like point of

394
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:56,565
Speaker 4:  sales devices in supermarkets should be iPads. You know, it's like

395
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:59,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah, but that's, that's expensive for supermarkets. They, they can't afford

396
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:00,125
Speaker 4:  that.

397
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:04,205
Speaker 2:  Well, and I, I dunno that iPads are like famously perfect technology.

398
00:24:04,605 --> 00:24:07,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like there's, there's so many different solutions, but I think,

399
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:12,125
Speaker 4:  I think really what it should highlight is that these companies like CrowdStrike

400
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,925
Speaker 4:  and Microsoft need to definitely work a lot closer together

401
00:24:16,185 --> 00:24:19,725
Speaker 4:  rather than be in this competitive force against each other because

402
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:24,245
Speaker 4:  it's no good going on TV and bashing your competitors and stuff. And they

403
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:27,965
Speaker 4:  both do it. So it's like that, I think in cybersecurity in general at the

404
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:31,085
Speaker 4:  moment, there needs to just def definitely be a larger focus on the joint

405
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:35,205
Speaker 4:  customers. Who knows whether that happened, but yeah, the, the fact

406
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:38,485
Speaker 4:  that this sort of stuff can take down so much stuff and it was only less

407
00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:42,365
Speaker 4:  than 1% of Windows machines, that that should be a major red flag. Like

408
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:46,085
Speaker 4:  if this was 10% upwards, it, it'd be, you know,

409
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,725
Speaker 4:  who knows, like if if it was a Windows update they'd done this as well. Like

410
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:51,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah, well

411
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:54,165
Speaker 2:  I was just gonna say, like you, you talk about nobody's security record is

412
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:57,285
Speaker 2:  perfect. Like if, if this is something Microsoft had pushed

413
00:24:58,025 --> 00:25:01,765
Speaker 2:  and, and there's not necessarily a good reason, it couldn't have been

414
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:05,885
Speaker 2:  Microsoft that pushed it. No, the scale would've been dramatically

415
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:09,685
Speaker 2:  different. Like part of what I, I think, and you, you've probably seen more

416
00:25:09,685 --> 00:25:13,405
Speaker 2:  of this than I have, but to me at least it seems like the question of what

417
00:25:13,405 --> 00:25:17,205
Speaker 2:  went wrong at CrowdStrike that allowed this to happen is gonna be

418
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:18,085
Speaker 2:  the big question.

419
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:20,325
Speaker 4:  Why wasn't it tested right. Like that,

420
00:25:20,415 --> 00:25:24,285
Speaker 2:  Right? Or like, was this the kind of thing that they do

421
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:27,965
Speaker 2:  a million times a day and so somebody got sloppy, was this a failure of process?

422
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:31,805
Speaker 2:  Was this, did it follow the process? And you know, sometimes bad things happen.

423
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:35,365
Speaker 2:  Like that to me feels like the kind of core piece of this that we still

424
00:25:35,555 --> 00:25:39,325
Speaker 2:  haven't really seen is like what, what or who

425
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:43,205
Speaker 2:  screwed up that this could happen and is it a thing we can fix or is this

426
00:25:43,205 --> 00:25:45,605
Speaker 2:  just like a thing that's gonna happen every once in a while and we have to

427
00:25:45,605 --> 00:25:46,525
Speaker 2:  figure out how to live with it?

428
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:50,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think what it, what it created was like a, a basically a sort of

429
00:25:50,485 --> 00:25:54,405
Speaker 4:  memory panic. So it was like this file calls the

430
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:58,045
Speaker 4:  driver to be like, try to write to a part of memory that it shouldn't be.

431
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:02,925
Speaker 4:  And then Windows is obviously like, no, you can't do that. Let's kill

432
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:06,765
Speaker 4:  this driver. Or, or the driver crashed and killed Windows with it.

433
00:26:07,245 --> 00:26:10,125
Speaker 4:  I think when it comes to like, there's gonna be obviously a lot of pointing

434
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:14,085
Speaker 4:  fingers and who, who takes the blame for it. But I think there's definitely

435
00:26:14,595 --> 00:26:18,285
Speaker 4:  Windows should do a better job at this, but there's also, CrowdStrike should

436
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,405
Speaker 4:  do a better job at testing its update. Like how has that gone out to

437
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:25,085
Speaker 4:  8.5 million devices and not being spotted?

438
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:28,565
Speaker 4:  Like why, why don't they automate that testing or something like short,

439
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:33,125
Speaker 4:  there's gonna be questions about how that actually happened. But yeah, like

440
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:36,845
Speaker 4:  they, I think Microsoft takes probably like, I dunno, 10 to

441
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:40,365
Speaker 4:  20% of the blame here or something. And I just hope that they both look at

442
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:44,005
Speaker 4:  it and come up with a solution that stops this from ever happening again,

443
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:47,005
Speaker 4:  because I don't think the solution is rip these guys out the kernel because

444
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:51,205
Speaker 4:  Microsoft doesn't do a ton of innovative stuff with Windows at the moment.

445
00:26:51,385 --> 00:26:55,245
Speaker 4:  So allowing people to have kernel access allows for some of that innovation

446
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:59,325
Speaker 4:  and some like CrowdStrike pushes that security innovation where Microsoft

447
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:03,245
Speaker 4:  might not take it like Internet Explorer back in the day, if we just let

448
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:06,965
Speaker 4:  Microsoft define the web, we wouldn't have had Chrome, we wouldn't have had

449
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:10,005
Speaker 4:  all that competition. So it's like, I don't wanna see it swing one way or

450
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:13,965
Speaker 4:  the other. I just wanna see cooperation. Really. Yeah. This never

451
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:14,445
Speaker 4:  happens again.

452
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:18,605
Speaker 2:  Well and especially in these moments where these things are

453
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:22,525
Speaker 2:  not allowed to fail. Right. I think part of what was so

454
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:25,925
Speaker 2:  eyeopening, I think about this whole thing was just realizing how much of

455
00:27:25,925 --> 00:27:29,605
Speaker 2:  the world runs on Windows computers. Yeah. And not,

456
00:27:29,745 --> 00:27:33,685
Speaker 2:  not even different Windows computers, just Windows computers that like

457
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:37,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The, the signs you see at the mall are just Windows computers

458
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:38,605
Speaker 2:  and, and I think you

459
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:41,565
Speaker 4:  Go to an ATM and take out cash, it's probably Windows. Yeah.

460
00:27:41,595 --> 00:27:45,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And so I think to me the this question of, okay,

461
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:49,005
Speaker 2:  we have, we have these operating systems, we have this software,

462
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:53,925
Speaker 2:  do we need to think really differently about the ones that are like modern

463
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:57,085
Speaker 2:  infrastructure in a way that isn't just

464
00:27:58,325 --> 00:28:01,845
Speaker 2:  functionally a Windows computer? Like, I don't know, it just the fact that

465
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:05,605
Speaker 2:  it's basically just a bunch of like crappy little PC boxes that keep our

466
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:09,285
Speaker 2:  banks running is one of those things I think a lot of people sort of intellectually

467
00:28:09,285 --> 00:28:13,005
Speaker 2:  know, but it's actually probably not how it should work. And I don't know,

468
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:15,845
Speaker 2:  this is where I get in like way over my head on how all the technology of

469
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:19,165
Speaker 2:  this actually works, but it does feel like we are at a point where there

470
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:22,765
Speaker 2:  is a set of computers in the world that just cannot fail. Yeah. And that

471
00:28:22,765 --> 00:28:26,685
Speaker 2:  maybe having them be just computers is not the

472
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:27,725
Speaker 2:  right way to think

473
00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:30,725
Speaker 4:  About it. Yeah. I dunno what the alternative is, but that's

474
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:31,405
Speaker 2:  The thing. I don't either,

475
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:34,645
Speaker 4:  That's the thing is that it, they're just cheap, right? It's, it's cheaper

476
00:28:34,665 --> 00:28:38,205
Speaker 4:  for them to, what is the alternative really? Like they're not gonna go Mac

477
00:28:38,265 --> 00:28:41,845
Speaker 4:  os they, they could do Linux, but then that could be complicated. Like it's

478
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

479
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,565
Speaker 2:  That has its own mess. Yeah.

480
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:47,045
Speaker 4:  So it's like, I, I don't know. There's no, I think that's the biggest problem

481
00:28:47,145 --> 00:28:50,805
Speaker 4:  is that there is actually a monopoly here right? At play with, with Windows.

482
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:54,325
Speaker 4:  and it was has been, and it's like there isn't really a good

483
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:58,165
Speaker 4:  alternative and the alternative to securities things are now causing

484
00:28:58,165 --> 00:29:02,085
Speaker 4:  issues. It's like, yeah, like where do you,

485
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:05,285
Speaker 4:  where do you stop at this? But I mean, maybe the alternative is Microsoft

486
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,765
Speaker 4:  creates a lockdown version windows for these sort of devices. I think they've

487
00:29:07,765 --> 00:29:09,565
Speaker 4:  done similar sort of stuff in the past, but

488
00:29:11,225 --> 00:29:15,205
Speaker 4:  the, the problem there is that then you get complicated apps that wanna do

489
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:19,005
Speaker 4:  stuff on these and then you have that, the same thing

490
00:29:19,005 --> 00:29:21,525
Speaker 4:  is like, okay, well we just need to give them windows. So,

491
00:29:21,665 --> 00:29:24,925
Speaker 2:  And you get to the point where there's only two people on earth and one vendor

492
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:27,965
Speaker 2:  that know how to service these things and that causes its own problems. And

493
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:31,405
Speaker 2:  it's, it's a tough thing, but it feels like, I, I wonder

494
00:29:32,065 --> 00:29:36,005
Speaker 2:  if this moment ends up being a kind of a blip on the radar or if

495
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:39,565
Speaker 2:  people start to talk seriously about like, okay, how do we make these things

496
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:42,965
Speaker 2:  work the way that we need them to going forward? And I have no idea what

497
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:44,885
Speaker 2:  that'll look like, but I think it'll be fascinating to watch. And,

498
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:47,765
Speaker 4:  And the fragility of this situation just reminds me of like, when I used

499
00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:51,725
Speaker 4:  to be an IT admin, we, we literally had like a ticker that would go

500
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:55,725
Speaker 4:  around in, in Canary Wolf and it was powered by spreadsheet, an Excel

501
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:59,125
Speaker 4:  spreadsheet, and I'd input data into it myself and maintain it. And if I

502
00:29:59,325 --> 00:30:02,165
Speaker 4:  put in something wrong, it would crash the whole ticket. It'd be like flashing

503
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:06,005
Speaker 4:  and going crazy. Like that's just, you know, that's just like

504
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:09,925
Speaker 4:  the perfect example of how you see this stuff out in the world, like the

505
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:13,805
Speaker 4:  screens at airports and you just don't realize that usually it's some

506
00:30:13,805 --> 00:30:17,565
Speaker 4:  crappy software. Just the most basic stuff

507
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:20,805
Speaker 4:  powering that thing. Yeah. Probably from like 10, 20 years ago.

508
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:25,005
Speaker 2:  I ju I keep thinking about for whatever reason the, I think it was when

509
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,205
Speaker 2:  Oppenheimer was out and there was that picture of somebody posted of the

510
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:31,725
Speaker 2:  IMAX theater with a, with a palm pilot powering it.

511
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:35,285
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah. And we went and found somebody who ran the theater and they were

512
00:30:35,285 --> 00:30:39,205
Speaker 2:  like, look, it works. Nobody touches it. It's been there for years. Like

513
00:30:39,385 --> 00:30:42,125
Speaker 2:  no one understands it. It's just this weird little thing that keeps the plate

514
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:45,165
Speaker 2:  spinning. So we, we, we keep it running and I feel like yeah, that's good.

515
00:30:45,195 --> 00:30:48,045
Speaker 2:  More of the world works like that than any of us would like

516
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:51,165
Speaker 4:  To do. Definitely. Oh yeah. It's all like held to give it by string and that,

517
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:53,245
Speaker 4:  that strings started going apart on Friday.

518
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:57,525
Speaker 2:  Exactly. So it seems like most of the worst of

519
00:30:57,525 --> 00:31:01,045
Speaker 2:  this is if not over then kind of on the way to recovery.

520
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:04,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think so. I think 'cause it, if you're an it TM and in a business,

521
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:08,765
Speaker 4:  you're gonna prioritize your, the people and systems that matter the most

522
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:10,605
Speaker 4:  first of all, and get those back up and running and

523
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:12,965
Speaker 2:  Stuff. Yeah. There are a lot of people who worked all weekend, I suspect.

524
00:31:12,985 --> 00:31:16,965
Speaker 2:  Yes. So to to all of you it folks listening, we, we we love you.

525
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's the, that's, that's a tough one, especially when on Friday when

526
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:22,565
Speaker 4:  you think, ah, nice chill Friday, did you feel to the weekend

527
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,565
Speaker 2:  What fallout is left here? What are you keeping an eye on this week?

528
00:31:25,905 --> 00:31:28,805
Speaker 4:  I'm definitely keeping an eye on the Delta situation because they seem to

529
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:31,965
Speaker 4:  be the most impacted by this in terms of airlines,

530
00:31:33,005 --> 00:31:36,965
Speaker 4:  hospitals, because we've seen people like not being able to get their

531
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:40,925
Speaker 4:  appointments and stuff to see 'cause in schools, I guess

532
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:44,565
Speaker 4:  as well though in, certainly in Europe and the uk like a lot of kids are

533
00:31:44,565 --> 00:31:48,365
Speaker 4:  outta school now for the summer holidays. So we will see it is

534
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:51,125
Speaker 4:  where there's typically less investment

535
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:56,165
Speaker 4:  in infrastructure where, where it kind of matters like schools and, and,

536
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:59,525
Speaker 4:  and hospitals and stuff where they just don't have the budget. So it'd be

537
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:03,005
Speaker 4:  interesting to see where those go and, and where there's still some sort

538
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:06,885
Speaker 4:  of lingering issues to today and tomorrow, but I feel like we'll hear

539
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:10,565
Speaker 4:  less about this as as the week goes on for sure. It's it's definitely,

540
00:32:11,075 --> 00:32:12,485
Speaker 4:  yeah. It's getting better out

541
00:32:12,485 --> 00:32:15,725
Speaker 2:  There in some sense. Like thank God it happened on a Friday and not on like

542
00:32:15,805 --> 00:32:18,805
Speaker 2:  a Tuesday morning. Yeah. And we would've felt the full effects of this for

543
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:21,005
Speaker 2:  like a couple of days in the middle of the week. Yeah,

544
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:24,005
Speaker 4:  We'll see. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. It's on its way to being, being fixed

545
00:32:24,005 --> 00:32:24,965
Speaker 4:  now anyway. That's good.

546
00:32:24,995 --> 00:32:28,485
Speaker 2:  Well, yeah, here as always, computers are

547
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:29,725
Speaker 2:  terrifying, fragile things.

548
00:32:30,385 --> 00:32:33,445
Speaker 4:  The funniest thing about it though was like one, one of Microsoft's fixes

549
00:32:33,445 --> 00:32:36,085
Speaker 4:  was like literally have you turned it off and on 15 times.

550
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:37,365
Speaker 2:  Unreal.

551
00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:38,685
Speaker 4:  It's like, it's the meme coming

552
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:42,485
Speaker 2:  True. It really, like, it is astounding how much of the world is just unplug

553
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:45,165
Speaker 2:  it and plug it back in again. And it's, I mean it goes back to the same thing,

554
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:48,845
Speaker 2:  right? Like the these things are are fragile and simple

555
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:52,645
Speaker 2:  in, in so, so many ways that we would Yeah. Like maybe it's scary that they're

556
00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:54,965
Speaker 2:  that fragile and that simple. But that is, that is where we are. It definitely

557
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:58,285
Speaker 2:  is. Yeah. Yeah. All right, Tom, thank you as always.

558
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:01,765
Speaker 2:  No worries. Thanks for having me. All right, we gotta take a break and then

559
00:33:01,765 --> 00:33:05,365
Speaker 2:  we're gonna come back, talk about fitness, but like in a, in a fun way,

560
00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:06,285
Speaker 2:  we'll be right back.

561
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:12,905
Speaker 2:  to exercise more, do better, get in better shape, keep

562
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:16,545
Speaker 2:  track of how you're doing without all of the stuff that feels

563
00:35:17,385 --> 00:35:21,305
Speaker 2:  gamified and toxic and like it's always pushing you to do more and

564
00:35:21,305 --> 00:35:25,225
Speaker 2:  incentivizing you to go do crazy things when it might hurt you or you're

565
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:29,065
Speaker 2:  sick. Or like, if I just have the Apple Watch yell at me

566
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:32,905
Speaker 2:  for not closing my rings when I'm sick one more time, I'm gonna lose my

567
00:35:32,905 --> 00:35:36,665
Speaker 2:  mind. You know what I mean? So to kick off our discussions about the

568
00:35:36,675 --> 00:35:40,245
Speaker 2:  Super Chill exercise system, real name pending, we'll see,

569
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:45,045
Speaker 2:  I wanted to talk to the person who made Zombies Run. So v and I called up

570
00:35:45,045 --> 00:35:48,685
Speaker 2:  Adrian Hanh, who is a writer and developer and

571
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:52,645
Speaker 2:  storyteller and worked on Zombies Run from the very beginning until

572
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:56,285
Speaker 2:  very recently. He spent more than a decade writing this game.

573
00:35:56,465 --> 00:36:00,045
Speaker 2:  And Zombies Run if you've never Played It is, I don't know how

574
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:04,005
Speaker 2:  to describe it exactly, it's an exercise fitness app

575
00:36:04,555 --> 00:36:08,205
Speaker 2:  that is also narrative. So when you're running,

576
00:36:08,755 --> 00:36:12,005
Speaker 2:  it's tracking you and it's aware of what you're doing, but it weaves a story

577
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:16,085
Speaker 2:  in, basically it's a zombie apocalypse. You're in a place called Able

578
00:36:16,085 --> 00:36:19,845
Speaker 2:  Township and you are a runner. That's your job, right? You,

579
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:23,885
Speaker 2:  you go out into the barren wasteland of the post

580
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:27,845
Speaker 2:  apocalyptic world and you do quests, you have to go find something or

581
00:36:27,845 --> 00:36:30,685
Speaker 2:  you have to go rescue somebody or you have to go to another place and learn

582
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:33,965
Speaker 2:  about something. And it's all incentivizing you to run

583
00:36:34,545 --> 00:36:38,445
Speaker 2:  and be active and be out. But the idea is to make

584
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:42,325
Speaker 2:  it fun with story, right? You're, you're picking it up every morning to see

585
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,685
Speaker 2:  what happens next. Not to not break some streak.

586
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:49,605
Speaker 2:  This app worked really well for me. Just having a thing that

587
00:36:49,865 --> 00:36:53,565
Speaker 2:  pushed me out, that gave me something fun to do while I was running. Sometimes

588
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:57,125
Speaker 2:  it'll just be like, oh no zombies and you have to run faster. It was awesome.

589
00:36:57,435 --> 00:37:01,405
Speaker 2:  Like, I've always been a a person who likes sports more than I like

590
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:04,845
Speaker 2:  just running because in sports, like there's something to do. I have a purpose

591
00:37:04,905 --> 00:37:08,365
Speaker 2:  for why I'm moving fast. This felt like that. and it,

592
00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:12,685
Speaker 2:  it's kind of like immersive in the way that listening to podcasts is

593
00:37:12,685 --> 00:37:16,325
Speaker 2:  immersive. It sort of distracts you from running while also having you run

594
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:19,885
Speaker 2:  The story is great. You get to know the characters, there's just something

595
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:23,365
Speaker 2:  terrific about this game, but I haven't really seen replicated elsewhere.

596
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:27,525
Speaker 2:  And Adrian was one of the people who built this thing from the very beginning.

597
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:31,725
Speaker 2:  So v and I called up Adrian to get a sense of how a game

598
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:35,485
Speaker 2:  like this comes together, why it's hard to do and

599
00:37:36,155 --> 00:37:39,485
Speaker 2:  what it took to really pull it off. And we just started at the beginning.

600
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:43,245
Speaker 2:  We asked him basically, you know, over a decade ago,

601
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:47,525
Speaker 2:  you're thinking about building a fitness game. This is like in the early

602
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:50,405
Speaker 2:  days of the iPhone. Where do you even start?

603
00:37:51,465 --> 00:37:55,165
Speaker 5:  I'm Adrian Hahn. I ran Six Start and

604
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:58,925
Speaker 5:  Co-founded it for 17 years. And so we made Zombies Run.

605
00:37:59,045 --> 00:38:02,885
Speaker 5:  I left about three months ago, four months ago. So that's

606
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,805
Speaker 5:  probably the most well-known thing that I've done,

607
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:10,685
Speaker 5:  made Zombies Run and also wrote a book critiquing gamification

608
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:14,685
Speaker 5:  called You've Been Played. So that's fun. So

609
00:38:14,905 --> 00:38:18,405
Speaker 5:  you know, when we came up with the idea for Zombies Run, it was myself and

610
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:22,205
Speaker 5:  novelist, Naomi Alderman. And I had just

611
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:26,205
Speaker 5:  kind of like really gotten into running at that time. And I had a

612
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:30,125
Speaker 5:  Garmin Forerunner 2 0 5, 2 0 1. So if, if you

613
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:33,845
Speaker 5:  remember this, this is a massive, like chunky, it's not a watch. I mean it's

614
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:37,725
Speaker 5:  like a forearm bracelet and it could

615
00:38:37,725 --> 00:38:41,685
Speaker 5:  track you by GPS. And I got this as a kind of way to

616
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:45,405
Speaker 5:  make myself run more. and it actually did work because it was cool

617
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:49,205
Speaker 5:  to see like numbers and to see that I was getting better every,

618
00:38:49,205 --> 00:38:53,005
Speaker 5:  every day, every time I ran. And it had this thing called,

619
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:57,205
Speaker 5:  I think it was like the virtual racer or virtual runner, which is like

620
00:38:57,205 --> 00:39:00,405
Speaker 5:  what it sounds like, it's like ghost racing in, in Mario Kart where you're

621
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:04,285
Speaker 5:  racing against yourself. So You can go and go out for a run and it will

622
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:07,485
Speaker 5:  show you yourself versus yesterday's self.

623
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:11,805
Speaker 5:  and it was kind of really cool to see myself like in this very

624
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:15,805
Speaker 5:  proto gamification thing, getting better each time. But

625
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:19,445
Speaker 5:  then there was a moment where I stopped getting better and I started getting

626
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:23,365
Speaker 5:  worse and like my past self started beating myself. And I

627
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:26,845
Speaker 5:  was like, this sucks. Like this is not motivating anymore because

628
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:31,165
Speaker 5:  that only works on the way up. Like it, it doesn't work on the way down or

629
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:35,085
Speaker 5:  when you plateau or if you're ill. And so then

630
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:38,765
Speaker 5:  the iPhone came out and then the app store came out and we had Runkeeper,

631
00:39:39,535 --> 00:39:43,485
Speaker 5:  there were even some smartphone running games, actually there was one

632
00:39:43,485 --> 00:39:46,565
Speaker 5:  called Cash and Seek made by Korean

633
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:50,885
Speaker 5:  developer, I think. And the ideas that you'd run around your neighborhood

634
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:53,485
Speaker 5:  and you'd see a map and there'd be like little treasure there and it was

635
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:56,605
Speaker 5:  actually like multiplayer 'cause other people could leave treasure for you.

636
00:39:57,345 --> 00:40:00,925
Speaker 5:  And I started playing that and I was like, I actually just don't want to

637
00:40:00,925 --> 00:40:04,325
Speaker 5:  run to these places. It's telling me to run to 'cause it's like not very

638
00:40:04,475 --> 00:40:06,365
Speaker 5:  safe or it, it doesn't look nice.

639
00:40:08,425 --> 00:40:11,645
Speaker 5:  And so we started thinking about like, well how could we make

640
00:40:12,685 --> 00:40:16,645
Speaker 5:  a good running game because people are trying to make these running

641
00:40:16,645 --> 00:40:20,485
Speaker 5:  games. I mean, one of the problems of a lot of them actually

642
00:40:20,825 --> 00:40:24,525
Speaker 5:  was you have to look at the screen when you're running, which I think

643
00:40:24,745 --> 00:40:28,685
Speaker 5:  for people who have not run before, that

644
00:40:28,685 --> 00:40:32,445
Speaker 5:  sounds cool. Like, that sounds like a good idea. And if you've ever run

645
00:40:32,755 --> 00:40:36,605
Speaker 5:  then you, you're like, this is not just terrible from a kind of safety point

646
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:39,685
Speaker 5:  of view, but also if you stop every like two minutes to look at your phone

647
00:40:39,865 --> 00:40:43,285
Speaker 5:  and then start running again, like, how are you really gonna do that? Like

648
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:47,165
Speaker 5:  that, that's not really practical. So the idea kind

649
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:50,805
Speaker 5:  of came from, look, we have this amazing piece of technology, which is like

650
00:40:50,845 --> 00:40:54,605
Speaker 5:  a sort of like handheld computer, which is brand new really. It's got

651
00:40:54,805 --> 00:40:58,605
Speaker 5:  internet connection, it's got GPS, it's got sound, people

652
00:40:58,605 --> 00:41:02,565
Speaker 5:  are used to using their headphones. What can we do of this to make a

653
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:05,805
Speaker 5:  game? And so that's a lot of constraints, but it was also like really interesting

654
00:41:05,805 --> 00:41:07,125
Speaker 5:  from a game design point of view.

655
00:41:07,475 --> 00:41:10,605
Speaker 2:  Well, and I think somewhere in there you're also having to make a lot of

656
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:14,245
Speaker 2:  decisions about like the mechanics of the game, right? Because you're, you're

657
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:16,525
Speaker 2:  talking about like, I think about all those early games and there were, or

658
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:20,405
Speaker 2:  all those early running apps and a lot of them were just like, track your

659
00:41:20,505 --> 00:41:23,045
Speaker 2:  run, right? Like there's a, there's a subset of people who just like wanna

660
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:25,565
Speaker 2:  know how far they run. But then like you're saying, there were others that

661
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:28,965
Speaker 2:  were starting to play with this. Like, how do we get you

662
00:41:29,425 --> 00:41:32,605
Speaker 2:  to run more? And this is when everybody was starting to experiment with all

663
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:35,605
Speaker 2:  these new ways of, ways of gamification and leaderboards and all these different

664
00:41:35,605 --> 00:41:39,445
Speaker 2:  things. And I feel like from the very beginning you kind of went the other

665
00:41:39,475 --> 00:41:40,885
Speaker 2:  direction of a lot of that

666
00:41:40,885 --> 00:41:44,765
Speaker 5:  Stuff. Yeah, the, the, there was a lot of, you know, to the extent that

667
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:47,885
Speaker 5:  they really thought about motivation, I think it was basically competition,

668
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:51,965
Speaker 5:  right? So it was like, we have a leaderboard and can you get to the top

669
00:41:51,965 --> 00:41:55,005
Speaker 5:  of the leaderboard? So like I was using the Fitbit at the time and everyone

670
00:41:55,005 --> 00:41:58,325
Speaker 5:  was trying to get to the top of the leaderboard and then the leaderboard

671
00:41:58,325 --> 00:42:01,525
Speaker 5:  would never move each week because you'd have the people who like are in

672
00:42:01,525 --> 00:42:04,285
Speaker 5:  Europe and they walk everywhere and you'd have the people in America at the

673
00:42:04,285 --> 00:42:06,845
Speaker 5:  bottom who drive everywhere and, and they don't, they don't climb. And so

674
00:42:06,845 --> 00:42:09,605
Speaker 5:  it's just like, this is not really motivating anyone. Actually,

675
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,765
Speaker 5:  another aspect of that kind of parallel to that, there'd be these

676
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:18,405
Speaker 5:  territory capture games where you'd have like, you divide the world up into

677
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:22,165
Speaker 5:  hexagons or squares and it'd be like, can you go and capture enough

678
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,485
Speaker 5:  space? And that's kind of like a leaderboard where it's just whoever runs

679
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:29,085
Speaker 5:  the most, you know, or has the most free time wins.

680
00:42:29,865 --> 00:42:33,725
Speaker 5:  And again, for some people that's really motivating. I don't really

681
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:37,445
Speaker 5:  think there was anything beyond that, not even kind of exploration.

682
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:41,805
Speaker 5:  And so we want to do something completely different, which was

683
00:42:42,485 --> 00:42:46,445
Speaker 5:  storytelling basically. It was like role play, which I didn't think had been

684
00:42:46,445 --> 00:42:50,325
Speaker 5:  done before in, in that aspect, but it really came

685
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:54,325
Speaker 5:  from the idea that people were already like listening to podcasts and

686
00:42:54,325 --> 00:42:57,085
Speaker 5:  audiobooks when they're running. So we weren't asking people to do anything

687
00:42:57,085 --> 00:43:00,885
Speaker 5:  new. And I think I still have this idea for a game,

688
00:43:00,985 --> 00:43:04,925
Speaker 5:  so feel free to steal it if you want. Which was, there's a, the

689
00:43:04,925 --> 00:43:08,845
Speaker 5:  bit in the born ultimatum when Jason Bourne

690
00:43:08,845 --> 00:43:12,605
Speaker 5:  is guiding this person through Waterloo Station and

691
00:43:12,635 --> 00:43:16,045
Speaker 5:  he's like, okay, turn right now, turn left here. Okay, pause for five seconds

692
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:19,765
Speaker 5:  and Bne goes and murders him. And I'm like, oh, that's kind of like a really,

693
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:23,605
Speaker 5:  that's a, that's a very like interesting like dramatic thing, which

694
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:27,445
Speaker 5:  is just entirely voice-based basically. And it's like, oh,

695
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:31,565
Speaker 5:  we could do something like that where, where you have this audio story, which

696
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:35,445
Speaker 5:  is telling you basically to run. And when you're

697
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:38,405
Speaker 5:  running crucially, you don't look at the screen, you don't tap on anything.

698
00:43:38,405 --> 00:43:42,365
Speaker 5:  So it's not, it's not really interactive game. You're

699
00:43:42,365 --> 00:43:46,285
Speaker 5:  just choosing or, or able to run fast or slower. And the

700
00:43:46,285 --> 00:43:50,165
Speaker 5:  story and the game kind of adapts to that. The zombies came into

701
00:43:50,165 --> 00:43:51,325
Speaker 5:  it because

702
00:43:53,015 --> 00:43:56,885
Speaker 5:  Naomi, my co-creator, she had just joined this running club

703
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:01,125
Speaker 5:  and they'd said, why do you want to run? And some people wanted to lose weight

704
00:44:01,425 --> 00:44:05,165
Speaker 5:  and other people wanted to get fit. And one woman said she

705
00:44:05,165 --> 00:44:08,845
Speaker 5:  wanted to survive the zombie apocalypse. And

706
00:44:09,345 --> 00:44:13,045
Speaker 5:  and I was like, oh yeah, that's funny. But then I was kind of like sick of

707
00:44:13,155 --> 00:44:16,845
Speaker 5:  zombies at that point. This was like 2011, 2012, and

708
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:20,445
Speaker 5:  we had the Walking Dead and we had, you know,

709
00:44:20,705 --> 00:44:24,405
Speaker 5:  28 days later and I kind of thought zombies were over, which, which was

710
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:27,925
Speaker 5:  wrong. They're, they're still here. But from a

711
00:44:27,925 --> 00:44:30,845
Speaker 5:  storytelling point of view and from a gameplay point of view, especially

712
00:44:30,865 --> 00:44:34,605
Speaker 5:  for a running game, that there's actually really nothing better that we found

713
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:38,525
Speaker 5:  because zombies, everyone knows how they work. You, you

714
00:44:38,525 --> 00:44:41,765
Speaker 5:  just have to kind of move faster than 'em. But also the great thing about

715
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:45,285
Speaker 5:  zombies is that they, most zombies don't actually run. So,

716
00:44:45,905 --> 00:44:49,725
Speaker 5:  you know, your classic zombies, your non 28 days later zombies,

717
00:44:49,835 --> 00:44:53,765
Speaker 5:  they just walk or they shamble. And so that was kind of a

718
00:44:53,765 --> 00:44:57,445
Speaker 5:  really clear thing for us, which was you don't actually have to run in

719
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:01,285
Speaker 5:  zombies run, You can just walk if you want and the game will

720
00:45:01,305 --> 00:45:05,285
Speaker 5:  not give you a hard time for that. Like there is nothing gated in

721
00:45:05,475 --> 00:45:09,205
Speaker 5:  zombies run based on your distance or your pace.

722
00:45:09,745 --> 00:45:13,525
Speaker 5:  So if you even want to do it sitting on a couch, You can do that. Like,

723
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:16,365
Speaker 5:  and some people do it like doing chores or whatever, and then most people

724
00:45:16,385 --> 00:45:20,165
Speaker 5:  do run or jog. And so the crucial thing there was

725
00:45:20,335 --> 00:45:24,245
Speaker 5:  we're not measuring your performance. Like You can measure your performance.

726
00:45:24,345 --> 00:45:27,845
Speaker 5:  We give you stats and things like that, but actually we're not rewarding

727
00:45:27,845 --> 00:45:31,805
Speaker 5:  that in a way what we're doing is we're saying we're just gonna make

728
00:45:31,805 --> 00:45:35,045
Speaker 5:  it more fun. Like, you know, we don't wanna make it like we, we don't wanna

729
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:38,325
Speaker 5:  reward you for doing a run. We want you to be rewarded while running,

730
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:42,645
Speaker 5:  which is a really important difference. And I think gets

731
00:45:42,645 --> 00:45:46,605
Speaker 5:  to like what makes for good gamification. Like good gamification

732
00:45:46,615 --> 00:45:50,445
Speaker 5:  means where you are having fun while you're doing it, not after you've done

733
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:52,045
Speaker 5:  it, which is really hard to do.

734
00:45:52,605 --> 00:45:56,125
Speaker 6:  I actually, this is my, my running journey began with

735
00:45:56,235 --> 00:46:00,165
Speaker 6:  Zombies Run. Oh wow. 'cause I, I, you know, I've been running for a

736
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:04,045
Speaker 6:  long time, but I was not a natural runner in

737
00:46:04,105 --> 00:46:07,845
Speaker 6:  any form. I was the person who is very much like my natural

738
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:11,805
Speaker 6:  form is a couch potato. You could, you would have to be chasing

739
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:15,845
Speaker 6:  me basically for me to run. But it was a, it was a type of thing where

740
00:46:15,845 --> 00:46:19,805
Speaker 6:  I was like, oh, I have like a metabolic thing I need to actually

741
00:46:20,785 --> 00:46:24,565
Speaker 6:  run. Running is one of the cheapest ways that You can exercise, but it is

742
00:46:24,575 --> 00:46:28,045
Speaker 6:  quite miserable when you're starting out. Yeah. So

743
00:46:28,355 --> 00:46:31,605
Speaker 6:  like, I think the thing that really resonates with me here in terms of like,

744
00:46:31,605 --> 00:46:35,485
Speaker 6:  just talking about the chillness of things is like actually having fun

745
00:46:35,615 --> 00:46:39,445
Speaker 6:  while you exercise. Because I think with fitness tech and like with the

746
00:46:39,445 --> 00:46:43,165
Speaker 6:  gamification of it, I don't know why, but we just decide to

747
00:46:43,165 --> 00:46:46,845
Speaker 6:  invite so much anxiety into the process. Like leaderboard,

748
00:46:47,345 --> 00:46:51,245
Speaker 6:  oh, well I feel terrible about myself because I'm not number one. And then

749
00:46:51,245 --> 00:46:55,165
Speaker 6:  if I am number one, I have this intense pressure to stay number one.

750
00:46:55,545 --> 00:46:59,525
Speaker 6:  And so then that's, that's not fun anymore. I've turned the, the exercise

751
00:46:59,755 --> 00:47:03,485
Speaker 6:  into work. And then also just as you said, like it really kind of

752
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:07,285
Speaker 6:  resonated with the whole idea of the virtual runner and you're

753
00:47:07,285 --> 00:47:10,925
Speaker 6:  running against your past self who is better than you? I am at that stage

754
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:14,045
Speaker 6:  because if you do it long enough, if you do it long enough, you are going

755
00:47:14,045 --> 00:47:18,005
Speaker 6:  to plateau. You are gonna have a slump. You're just not, you're just

756
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:22,365
Speaker 6:  you age, you know, as you get older, you're not gonna be quite as fast

757
00:47:22,385 --> 00:47:26,365
Speaker 6:  as you were when you were younger. So I think with the game

758
00:47:26,505 --> 00:47:29,725
Speaker 6:  you want people to keep playing. So how, how, like what were some of the

759
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:33,165
Speaker 6:  things that you tried that you just realized was like, oh,

760
00:47:34,075 --> 00:47:37,805
Speaker 6:  this is actually making the game less fun, or Oh this is making the game

761
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:38,365
Speaker 6:  more fun?

762
00:47:39,435 --> 00:47:43,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean, you know, people come into it with different like motivations

763
00:47:43,545 --> 00:47:47,525
Speaker 5:  and different expectations. So we did this Kickstarter right

764
00:47:47,605 --> 00:47:51,245
Speaker 5:  at the beginning and there were kind of two strands to it. One was there's

765
00:47:51,245 --> 00:47:54,645
Speaker 5:  gonna be an amazing story by an amazing storyteller. And

766
00:47:55,425 --> 00:47:59,205
Speaker 5:  for a lot of people, possibly even most people, that's like the big motivation,

767
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:03,125
Speaker 5:  which is I go out for a run. It, it's kind of told like in

768
00:48:03,135 --> 00:48:07,085
Speaker 5:  first person. So they're talking to you as if you are like, you know, a real

769
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:10,725
Speaker 5:  person. It's not like an audio book. and it has amazing characters.

770
00:48:10,795 --> 00:48:14,285
Speaker 5:  It's got like cliffhangers at the end of every mission. So, so you kind of

771
00:48:14,285 --> 00:48:18,005
Speaker 5:  want to know what happens next. And for us that's a big thing

772
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:22,045
Speaker 5:  where it was always, you know, we want you to get up on a rainy

773
00:48:22,045 --> 00:48:25,845
Speaker 5:  Sunday morning and actually be excited to find out what's gonna happen next

774
00:48:25,845 --> 00:48:29,485
Speaker 5:  rather than be like, is there any excuse I can use not to go to rock.

775
00:48:30,025 --> 00:48:33,365
Speaker 2:  So I just, I just wanna push back on one piece of that that I think is really

776
00:48:33,565 --> 00:48:36,805
Speaker 2:  interesting that you said, which is the, the idea that You can like, it,

777
00:48:36,805 --> 00:48:39,325
Speaker 2:  it, you could just sit on your couch and play the game and it would still

778
00:48:39,325 --> 00:48:42,805
Speaker 2:  be very fun, right? Yeah. I think that there's, there's probably some truth

779
00:48:42,825 --> 00:48:46,765
Speaker 2:  to that, but also if, if that were true, you would've just made a game

780
00:48:46,765 --> 00:48:49,285
Speaker 2:  that You can play sitting on your couch, right? Yeah. So, and, and part of

781
00:48:49,285 --> 00:48:52,765
Speaker 2:  the reason I think this is the thing v and I keep talking about is like gamification.

782
00:48:52,765 --> 00:48:56,325
Speaker 2:  When it's like monopoly go trying to get your money. I have pretty

783
00:48:56,485 --> 00:49:00,005
Speaker 2:  unconflicted problematic feelings about, but this one is so different, right?

784
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:03,845
Speaker 2:  Because the thing that you're doing, creepy things to incentivize

785
00:49:03,845 --> 00:49:07,485
Speaker 2:  people to do is like ostensibly a good and healthy thing. And so

786
00:49:07,705 --> 00:49:10,405
Speaker 2:  you're in a position of saying like, okay, we built this cool game that people

787
00:49:10,475 --> 00:49:13,565
Speaker 2:  like because it's a game, but they also like it because it makes them exercise

788
00:49:13,565 --> 00:49:15,845
Speaker 2:  and because it makes them do a thing that is good for them and it makes that

789
00:49:15,845 --> 00:49:19,805
Speaker 2:  thing more bearable. Like, does that change the balance of just

790
00:49:19,805 --> 00:49:23,685
Speaker 2:  like if the goal was to just get more micro transactions from people,

791
00:49:23,985 --> 00:49:27,125
Speaker 2:  you would play it one way, but when it's like, okay, we actually want to

792
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:31,085
Speaker 2:  have you do something that in moderation even at greater

793
00:49:31,685 --> 00:49:34,325
Speaker 2:  intervals than you're currently doing, it is a good thing. Like does that

794
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:35,365
Speaker 2:  change the way you think about that balance?

795
00:49:36,395 --> 00:49:40,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean I, I think that, you know, by, by trying to

796
00:49:40,165 --> 00:49:43,965
Speaker 5:  design it in the way we did, we left money on the table. Like, you know,

797
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:47,445
Speaker 5:  we could have had more engagement if we sent people notifications saying,

798
00:49:47,445 --> 00:49:50,845
Speaker 5:  you're gonna, everyone in your base is gonna die if you don't give a run

799
00:49:51,005 --> 00:49:53,525
Speaker 5:  tomorrow, right? I mean, that, that's what like most games that have done,

800
00:49:53,665 --> 00:49:57,365
Speaker 5:  you know, or we would say like if you go and do like a three mile run now,

801
00:49:57,955 --> 00:50:01,925
Speaker 5:  then you'll get double like, you know, supplies, right? Duolingo style

802
00:50:01,925 --> 00:50:05,205
Speaker 5:  stuff and, and that all this stuff is like really well documented and it

803
00:50:05,205 --> 00:50:08,685
Speaker 5:  does work like in terms of increasing engagement and, and

804
00:50:08,685 --> 00:50:12,485
Speaker 5:  conversions. But I think that that's the

805
00:50:12,485 --> 00:50:15,765
Speaker 5:  nice thing about owning your company and having, having a small company is

806
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:19,365
Speaker 5:  that You can just say, we're not gonna do that because we don't think that's

807
00:50:19,365 --> 00:50:23,325
Speaker 5:  gonna be a good experience for people in the long term. So we

808
00:50:23,325 --> 00:50:26,765
Speaker 5:  would get people saying, oh, but like, can't people just cheat? And it's

809
00:50:26,765 --> 00:50:29,405
Speaker 5:  like, yeah, people can cheat about anything. Like people can cheat in dance,

810
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:32,725
Speaker 5:  dance revolution, right? You can cheat a guitar hero, You can cheat all these

811
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:35,765
Speaker 5:  things. And it's like, if you're gonna cheat a dance dance revolution, don't

812
00:50:35,765 --> 00:50:39,045
Speaker 5:  play dance dance revolution. Like no one's making you do that. It doesn't

813
00:50:39,045 --> 00:50:42,845
Speaker 5:  really bother me as a designer because it just shows

814
00:50:42,845 --> 00:50:46,165
Speaker 5:  that you, you kind of need to do it a little bit differently. And, and I

815
00:50:46,165 --> 00:50:49,485
Speaker 5:  think that, you know, the other thing is I see it as a kind of accessibility

816
00:50:49,555 --> 00:50:52,485
Speaker 5:  mode mostly, rather than like, people cheating. So,

817
00:50:53,385 --> 00:50:57,205
Speaker 5:  you know, we don't know what situations people are in in terms of their ability

818
00:50:57,265 --> 00:51:00,485
Speaker 5:  to move. We call it like simulate running when we do this.

819
00:51:01,105 --> 00:51:02,965
Speaker 5:  It might be that you

820
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:08,005
Speaker 5:  can't use your legs, you know, then you're going to do another exercise while

821
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:11,565
Speaker 5:  you're doing this. And so we've had, you know, people

822
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:15,805
Speaker 5:  say, you know, they'd like it that we offer these options. So having

823
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:19,125
Speaker 5:  said that, like most people do actually run. So, so, so it's fine.

824
00:51:19,915 --> 00:51:23,525
Speaker 6:  It's a, it's a really interesting thing to me because I,

825
00:51:23,985 --> 00:51:27,765
Speaker 6:  it really just hits home with the whole one size does not fit all, but

826
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:31,165
Speaker 6:  especially with fitness, because we all have different capabilities, as you

827
00:51:31,165 --> 00:51:34,965
Speaker 6:  mentioned with our bodies. We have different skill levels, different circumstances,

828
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:38,645
Speaker 6:  but I find a lot of times I burn out when testing

829
00:51:38,645 --> 00:51:42,565
Speaker 6:  wearables and fitness tech because they are just

830
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:46,725
Speaker 6:  kind of pushing you towards more. and it sometimes does feel

831
00:51:46,725 --> 00:51:49,725
Speaker 6:  like part of this is late stage capitalism. Yeah. Because they need to make

832
00:51:49,725 --> 00:51:53,045
Speaker 6:  money off of this thing and they need to keep user bases. So they need to

833
00:51:53,045 --> 00:51:57,005
Speaker 6:  get us addicted to these platforms, like keep your streaks going. Sometimes

834
00:51:57,005 --> 00:52:00,925
Speaker 6:  it really does feel like streaks can be insidious just

835
00:52:00,925 --> 00:52:04,765
Speaker 6:  because like, oh, I know you're getting me addicted to this, but actually

836
00:52:04,765 --> 00:52:08,205
Speaker 6:  what my body is saying is I need to rest. I actually,

837
00:52:08,745 --> 00:52:12,285
Speaker 6:  so like, it's a tricky thing, right? Because if you wanna stay

838
00:52:12,385 --> 00:52:16,285
Speaker 6:  injury free, you can't constantly do more. You do have to

839
00:52:16,285 --> 00:52:20,085
Speaker 6:  take days off and that's good for you as well.

840
00:52:20,825 --> 00:52:24,045
Speaker 6:  So I think the big metric with

841
00:52:24,045 --> 00:52:27,885
Speaker 6:  gamification and fitness is streaks. And

842
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:31,645
Speaker 6:  I was just curious like what your thought process was

843
00:52:31,645 --> 00:52:35,565
Speaker 6:  towards streaks and like, do you have feelings towards it? I hate them

844
00:52:35,815 --> 00:52:36,485
Speaker 6:  personally.

845
00:52:37,075 --> 00:52:41,045
Speaker 5:  Just look, I, I hate them. I don't like them. I, I

846
00:52:41,045 --> 00:52:44,805
Speaker 5:  mean, you know, you, you will see people talk about how it

847
00:52:45,085 --> 00:52:48,245
Speaker 5:  motivates 'em to sort of go and ha if they're doing like nano rmo national,

848
00:52:48,305 --> 00:52:51,325
Speaker 5:  you know, novel writing month, it, it's like nice to have a streak where

849
00:52:51,325 --> 00:52:55,045
Speaker 5:  you're writing for 30 days in a row, right? Or you've got

850
00:52:55,165 --> 00:52:58,565
Speaker 5:  like a calendar and you like mark it with an X every time you, you know,

851
00:52:58,905 --> 00:53:02,765
Speaker 5:  do something useful. And so I always kind of think it's about

852
00:53:02,765 --> 00:53:06,285
Speaker 5:  like, how can you get the incentives aligned

853
00:53:06,285 --> 00:53:09,165
Speaker 5:  correctly, right? And so I think that

854
00:53:10,185 --> 00:53:14,165
Speaker 5:  the issue with like fitness is that, you know, you see this

855
00:53:14,165 --> 00:53:16,845
Speaker 5:  with the Apple watch, you see it with Peloton in particular. There are a

856
00:53:16,845 --> 00:53:19,965
Speaker 5:  lot of stories about Peloton where people were just completely burning out

857
00:53:20,505 --> 00:53:24,405
Speaker 5:  and like really injuring themselves. I just don't think this is like

858
00:53:25,145 --> 00:53:29,085
Speaker 5:  the way to like good health and fitness actually a lot of

859
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:32,965
Speaker 5:  these companies along with like, trying to get you addicted, they're trying

860
00:53:32,965 --> 00:53:36,845
Speaker 5:  to sell this idea of you becoming a, like an a literal elite athlete.

861
00:53:37,035 --> 00:53:40,925
Speaker 5:  Like, as if like, that is like a good thing to be, like, if you want to be

862
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:44,045
Speaker 5:  elite athlete, that that's fine. But like, it's not really

863
00:53:45,565 --> 00:53:48,645
Speaker 5:  a good idea frankly for, for, for most people. Like, you know, most people

864
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:51,885
Speaker 5:  have got jobs and they've got families and, and it's very hard to like maintain

865
00:53:51,885 --> 00:53:55,765
Speaker 5:  that, you know, it can be, it can actually be quite, quite damaging. And

866
00:53:55,805 --> 00:53:59,725
Speaker 5:  I see that with a lot of the marketing. I mean they've changed it a bit now,

867
00:53:59,725 --> 00:54:03,485
Speaker 5:  but like Nike and a lot of these other apps were like made by people who

868
00:54:04,435 --> 00:54:07,845
Speaker 5:  used to be athletes or, or who, who just like incredibly fit, right? And

869
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:10,725
Speaker 5:  so they'd be like, wow, you've gotta go and break through the pain barrier.

870
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:13,685
Speaker 5:  You've gotta go and do all this stuff. It's like, you don't, you don't actually

871
00:54:13,685 --> 00:54:17,205
Speaker 5:  need to do that. Like you are just saying you have to do that. So I don't,

872
00:54:17,325 --> 00:54:20,965
Speaker 5:  I don't like streaks. It can be done in a way that's like less

873
00:54:21,105 --> 00:54:24,965
Speaker 5:  bad, right? But I think that when I look at the

874
00:54:24,965 --> 00:54:28,605
Speaker 5:  best games and the best apps out there, like a Nintendo doesn't like,

875
00:54:30,005 --> 00:54:33,325
Speaker 5:  I mean, Nintendo does actually have streaks and animal crossing, but like,

876
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:36,765
Speaker 5:  it's very small. It's really small stuff and it, it doesn't, it's not punishing

877
00:54:36,765 --> 00:54:40,285
Speaker 5:  at all if you don't, if you don't match it. Like, you know, there are streaks

878
00:54:40,285 --> 00:54:44,045
Speaker 5:  in some video games, but like you play elder ring or you play, you know,

879
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:47,605
Speaker 5:  like legends as elder, that's not like a streak for playing it two days in

880
00:54:47,605 --> 00:54:51,165
Speaker 5:  a row. They don't need that because it's a really good game, right? And so

881
00:54:51,965 --> 00:54:55,925
Speaker 5:  I think it's just, it, you know, it it's an excuse it for

882
00:54:56,145 --> 00:55:00,085
Speaker 5:  not making something that is as targeted or is interesting for

883
00:55:00,085 --> 00:55:03,725
Speaker 5:  people. It's very difficult because, you know, if you're running a company,

884
00:55:03,755 --> 00:55:07,125
Speaker 5:  like I do have a lot of sympathy for people. Like we, we didn't take investment

885
00:55:07,235 --> 00:55:10,765
Speaker 5:  when we started and so like, or we have very little investment, so they were

886
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:14,245
Speaker 5:  like really patient and they were not giving us a hard time. You know, people

887
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:17,885
Speaker 5:  would call us like a lifestyle business I guess. But it does mean

888
00:55:18,195 --> 00:55:21,925
Speaker 5:  that if you take investment and you kind of have to take

889
00:55:21,925 --> 00:55:25,165
Speaker 5:  investment if you're a startup. 'cause otherwise you'll just be outgunned

890
00:55:25,385 --> 00:55:28,725
Speaker 5:  by all the other startups who take investment, right? You don't really have

891
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:32,325
Speaker 5:  a choice. They need to see the line go up. And one of the easiest ways of

892
00:55:32,325 --> 00:55:36,285
Speaker 5:  getting the line to go up is by adding in streaks, is by adding in notifications

893
00:55:36,305 --> 00:55:39,445
Speaker 5:  and, and making people feel bad about not using it. So,

894
00:55:40,585 --> 00:55:44,245
Speaker 5:  you know, I I can blame individual like, you know, designers here, but it's,

895
00:55:44,315 --> 00:55:46,125
Speaker 5:  it's like they're in an arm's race.

896
00:55:46,785 --> 00:55:50,045
Speaker 2:  It does feel like a much harder bar to set for yourself though, because essentially

897
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:53,645
Speaker 2:  what you're describing is that instead of punishing me for not doing the

898
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:56,365
Speaker 2:  thing that you've already given me, you have to keep giving me new things,

899
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:00,885
Speaker 2:  which is a lot of work for you. Yes. Like it's, it's much easier to

900
00:56:00,885 --> 00:56:04,605
Speaker 2:  just yell at me for not closing my rings than it is to like, like you, you,

901
00:56:04,605 --> 00:56:06,965
Speaker 2:  you mentioned Elden ring, like people play Elden ring because it's a great

902
00:56:06,965 --> 00:56:10,005
Speaker 2:  game. Like it's really hard to make a great game and it's much easier

903
00:56:11,025 --> 00:56:15,005
Speaker 2:  to build a mechanic that requires me to open the app every day or my

904
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:18,285
Speaker 2:  little character dies than it is to keep building a great game for 11 years.

905
00:56:18,435 --> 00:56:22,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That, that's, that's really true. Yeah. It, it's

906
00:56:22,325 --> 00:56:26,085
Speaker 5:  definitely not easy. I mean, when you make a a a a fitness game

907
00:56:26,085 --> 00:56:29,005
Speaker 5:  that's based around like narrative, you just need to keep on making more

908
00:56:29,005 --> 00:56:32,965
Speaker 5:  narrative, right? And so we turn from being

909
00:56:33,405 --> 00:56:37,005
Speaker 5:  a, a sort of tech company almost into like a content company, And, if you

910
00:56:37,005 --> 00:56:40,725
Speaker 5:  open up like Zombies Run or ZX now it kind of looks a bit like Netflix, like

911
00:56:40,725 --> 00:56:44,045
Speaker 5:  it has these carousels of Rose and you know, You can like, choose different

912
00:56:44,045 --> 00:56:47,805
Speaker 5:  stories, which is shows how the

913
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:51,485
Speaker 5:  company kind of evolved over time from like triangle, all these different

914
00:56:51,485 --> 00:56:55,205
Speaker 5:  like gameplay mechanics, some of which worked and some of which didn't into

915
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:59,165
Speaker 5:  like, okay, what we are doing is we're creating a

916
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:02,925
Speaker 5:  process to try and make as many like consistently

917
00:57:02,925 --> 00:57:06,885
Speaker 5:  good stories as possible. Like every week, multiple, multiple stories a week.

918
00:57:07,305 --> 00:57:10,565
Speaker 5:  And so you, we ended up with like writer's rooms and, and just

919
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:15,045
Speaker 5:  sound designers and you know, like it's games as a service, as

920
00:57:15,205 --> 00:57:19,045
Speaker 5:  software, as a service. And a lot of companies try and transition from

921
00:57:19,045 --> 00:57:22,605
Speaker 5:  making like a one-off game or one-off tech product into making constant,

922
00:57:22,825 --> 00:57:26,405
Speaker 5:  you know, content and it's just really difficult to do, especially when you're

923
00:57:26,405 --> 00:57:30,045
Speaker 5:  making like specialized stories that are like about you running,

924
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:34,285
Speaker 5:  you know, like that's, that's a different kind of storytelling

925
00:57:35,225 --> 00:57:39,045
Speaker 5:  and you know, the team did it really well, but I think that

926
00:57:39,185 --> 00:57:41,725
Speaker 5:  that's actually not something that tech companies are really set up to do.

927
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:45,925
Speaker 6:  It reminds me of Peloton because they too have become a media

928
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:49,645
Speaker 6:  company without I think necessarily intending that. Yeah.

929
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:53,765
Speaker 6:  So, you know, is, is this just then the challenge of

930
00:57:54,595 --> 00:57:58,525
Speaker 6:  gamifying fitness because I, I don't know, like I

931
00:57:58,525 --> 00:58:02,445
Speaker 6:  don't have an answer, but it's just like I constantly have to find

932
00:58:02,665 --> 00:58:06,245
Speaker 6:  new ways to motivate myself or sometimes just like

933
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:09,965
Speaker 6:  let myself have permission to be bad at fitness,

934
00:58:10,455 --> 00:58:14,165
Speaker 6:  which is opposite to what all these devices

935
00:58:14,345 --> 00:58:18,125
Speaker 6:  are doing, which is to optimize yourself to be the best version

936
00:58:18,145 --> 00:58:21,685
Speaker 6:  of yourself. I feel like there's conflicting narratives here where like,

937
00:58:22,405 --> 00:58:25,845
Speaker 6:  I think David and I just wanna like be slightly healthier and

938
00:58:26,225 --> 00:58:30,085
Speaker 6:  not beat ourselves while doing it. But then, you know, these

939
00:58:30,085 --> 00:58:33,845
Speaker 6:  watches, these rings, these games, not yours, but

940
00:58:33,955 --> 00:58:37,685
Speaker 6:  some of these games are just like, here's how to be the best version of yourself

941
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:41,085
Speaker 6:  with metrics and numbers and get you addicted to it. So how do you like,

942
00:58:41,565 --> 00:58:44,565
Speaker 5:  I mean they're sort of creating goals for you that maybe you didn't have

943
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:48,365
Speaker 5:  when you began, right? Which is like, you know, the, the longest I've ever

944
00:58:48,365 --> 00:58:52,045
Speaker 5:  run is a half marathon and everyone's like, oh, so why, why didn't you do

945
00:58:52,045 --> 00:58:55,085
Speaker 5:  like a marathon? I'm like, why would I do a marathon? I I don't want to do

946
00:58:55,085 --> 00:58:58,565
Speaker 5:  a marathon. Yes. That, that seems like You can reach that. That seems like

947
00:58:58,565 --> 00:59:02,285
Speaker 5:  a bad time for me. I'm I love it. I'm glad for you if you've done a

948
00:59:02,445 --> 00:59:05,725
Speaker 5:  marathon, you know, I know someone who did like an ultra marathon, you know,

949
00:59:05,815 --> 00:59:09,485
Speaker 5:  she's great, but like it's, it's not for me. And so

950
00:59:10,325 --> 00:59:13,965
Speaker 5:  I think when you start, you know, these applications, it's all games. It's

951
00:59:13,965 --> 00:59:16,445
Speaker 5:  always like, so what's your goal? And you've just got these like massive

952
00:59:16,455 --> 00:59:20,005
Speaker 5:  goals, right? You know, and like, oh, do I really wanna do that or do I just

953
00:59:20,005 --> 00:59:23,605
Speaker 5:  want to do something else? Just be a little bit healthier. So

954
00:59:24,245 --> 00:59:28,045
Speaker 5:  a big part of it is, you know, again, I just

955
00:59:28,045 --> 00:59:31,165
Speaker 5:  come back to like, how can we make it fun? How can we make it a little bit

956
00:59:31,165 --> 00:59:34,645
Speaker 5:  more bearable? You know, you mentioned the, like when you start out running,

957
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:38,965
Speaker 5:  you know, it was the same for me. It's just horrible. It like, it's so painful,

958
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:43,445
Speaker 5:  like sweaty, it's just like, you know, you get a stitch, I just can't

959
00:59:43,475 --> 00:59:47,365
Speaker 5:  like bear it. But then, you know, the thing is when you've done

960
00:59:47,365 --> 00:59:51,205
Speaker 5:  it a lot, you get good at running and now I don't need like a

961
00:59:51,205 --> 00:59:54,725
Speaker 5:  game to go running. Like I just go out running to music or

962
00:59:54,765 --> 00:59:58,205
Speaker 5:  podcasts and it's actually pretty easy for me, right? And so like,

963
00:59:58,745 --> 01:00:02,565
Speaker 5:  can we get people into that situation where they

964
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:05,605
Speaker 5:  don't need us anymore? Of course, like from a business point of view, you

965
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:08,365
Speaker 5:  know, you, you want people to keep on paying and, and hopefully you're fun

966
01:00:08,365 --> 01:00:12,165
Speaker 5:  enough, but that's where you want to get people to because it's the same

967
01:00:12,165 --> 01:00:14,885
Speaker 5:  with like a lot of stuff. When you get to a good enough point, it actually

968
01:00:14,885 --> 01:00:18,565
Speaker 5:  becomes way easier to, to maintain it. I do think

969
01:00:19,635 --> 01:00:23,245
Speaker 5:  it's gonna be a challenge for a lot of gamified fitness apps. Like, because

970
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:27,165
Speaker 5:  you, you just need to keep on providing the content. Like some of

971
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:30,805
Speaker 5:  them, you know, will just become basically gym instructor classes

972
01:00:30,955 --> 01:00:34,165
Speaker 5:  like, like Peloton, you know, or like a lot of VR staff,

973
01:00:34,905 --> 01:00:38,645
Speaker 5:  you know, some of them will just be constant competition, like the

974
01:00:38,645 --> 01:00:42,125
Speaker 5:  cycling, you know, things and Strava and that's fine. You know, they, if

975
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:45,525
Speaker 5:  you like that sort of thing, you should do it. I do think there's still more

976
01:00:45,525 --> 01:00:48,965
Speaker 5:  room for companies especially there's ar like becomes more of a thing

977
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:53,205
Speaker 5:  to do. Like even more fun ways of making

978
01:00:53,475 --> 01:00:57,325
Speaker 5:  like sports and like competitive sports and cooperative sports. I, I really

979
01:00:57,325 --> 01:01:00,525
Speaker 5:  wanna make like a cooperative fitness game. I think it'd be like so fun to

980
01:01:00,525 --> 01:01:04,245
Speaker 5:  do that. So yeah, like I think there's a lot we can do there. Like the kind

981
01:01:04,245 --> 01:01:08,005
Speaker 5:  of original gamified fitness is just playing like soccer, so like,

982
01:01:08,065 --> 01:01:10,645
Speaker 5:  you know, maybe we just do more of that, but I can make it bit more convenient.

983
01:01:11,545 --> 01:01:15,205
Speaker 6:  Are there any fitness apps or just like services

984
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:19,245
Speaker 6:  out there that you see and you're like, oh, I kind of dig what they're

985
01:01:19,245 --> 01:01:23,165
Speaker 6:  doing then because we have seen so many of them just kind of take the

986
01:01:23,165 --> 01:01:26,965
Speaker 6:  same leaderboard and competition approach to it. So is there

987
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:30,925
Speaker 6:  anyone out there that's doing it in a way that you're like, oh, that,

988
01:01:31,075 --> 01:01:34,525
Speaker 6:  that actually seems like that's a cool way for us

989
01:01:35,075 --> 01:01:38,725
Speaker 6:  anxious people out here? I have my list, but like us

990
01:01:38,725 --> 01:01:42,645
Speaker 6:  anxious people out here to actually take a step back and like build

991
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:45,485
Speaker 6:  the foundational habits and get to the point where you're saying like, you

992
01:01:45,685 --> 01:01:48,805
Speaker 6:  actually don't need it. Because I too am at the place where I'm like, oh,

993
01:01:49,465 --> 01:01:53,405
Speaker 6:  I'm a week without a run. I feel bad I need to like actually

994
01:01:53,865 --> 01:01:54,645
Speaker 6:  go out and do it.

995
01:01:55,205 --> 01:01:58,725
Speaker 5:  I actually just use like the apple like fitness app and the health app a

996
01:01:58,725 --> 01:02:01,765
Speaker 5:  lot to go and track my stuff, you know, like particularly things like sleep

997
01:02:01,945 --> 01:02:05,845
Speaker 5:  and like heart rate recovery. So these are like more, more kind of technical

998
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:09,805
Speaker 5:  like things I, I don't like have like a third party app that I

999
01:02:09,805 --> 01:02:13,445
Speaker 5:  use to track that. But it, it is useful because I've noticed it does

1000
01:02:13,445 --> 01:02:17,325
Speaker 5:  correlate actually with like when I've got more energy and I

1001
01:02:17,325 --> 01:02:21,125
Speaker 5:  do use, I use like the platform stuff because it just like

1002
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:24,405
Speaker 5:  integrates the best. So if I'm going for a run or for a swim, I just use

1003
01:02:24,645 --> 01:02:28,325
Speaker 5:  whatever's on the Apple watch, which is boring, but I, I

1004
01:02:28,355 --> 01:02:32,325
Speaker 5:  kind of don't want to, I've sort of seen

1005
01:02:32,395 --> 01:02:35,885
Speaker 5:  pass a curtain I guess for a lot of the stuff and I kind of a bit, I'm a

1006
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:39,725
Speaker 5:  bit worried about what people would try and do to my experience if

1007
01:02:39,805 --> 01:02:42,805
Speaker 5:  I let them, you know, I, I'm quite vulnerable to gamification.

1008
01:02:43,725 --> 01:02:46,565
Speaker 5:  I like, I like extended streaks, you know, if you, if you'd let me do it,

1009
01:02:46,865 --> 01:02:50,725
Speaker 5:  but even though I know it's not good for me and so I try and actually stay

1010
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:54,685
Speaker 5:  away from, from a lot of that stuff. So going for the more vanilla

1011
01:02:54,695 --> 01:02:57,685
Speaker 5:  Apple watch stuff is, is what I tend to stay on.

1012
01:02:58,425 --> 01:03:02,165
Speaker 2:  Do you think about things like sleep tracking and we're getting

1013
01:03:02,265 --> 01:03:05,045
Speaker 2:  to these smart rings and all this stuff and we're, we're getting to a point

1014
01:03:05,045 --> 01:03:08,845
Speaker 2:  where there is this kind of like second by second 24

1015
01:03:08,845 --> 01:03:12,165
Speaker 2:  hour long ability to understand how you're doing and I'm like, somebody is

1016
01:03:12,165 --> 01:03:15,685
Speaker 2:  gonna make the next version of Zombies Run that is not like an episodic thing

1017
01:03:15,685 --> 01:03:18,885
Speaker 2:  that you put on headphones and listen to while you go exercise. It's going

1018
01:03:18,885 --> 01:03:22,605
Speaker 2:  to be like a lifestyle game. And part of me wonders if that is

1019
01:03:22,935 --> 01:03:26,805
Speaker 2:  super cool or totally dystopian and, and the idea

1020
01:03:26,805 --> 01:03:30,085
Speaker 2:  of like, I'm gonna get a thing at, you know, 2:00 AM that's just like zombies

1021
01:03:30,195 --> 01:03:34,045
Speaker 2:  because it it understood that I'm like in the right sleep zone for it

1022
01:03:34,045 --> 01:03:37,045
Speaker 2:  and like this is coming, we have the data to do this now and it, it feels

1023
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:38,925
Speaker 2:  like it's coming and I can't decide if that's good or bad.

1024
01:03:40,585 --> 01:03:44,325
Speaker 5:  People keep on trying to do this and we, we tried to do it with a, with a

1025
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:47,405
Speaker 5:  game called the Walk, which was kinda like a all day like, you know, walking

1026
01:03:47,675 --> 01:03:51,645
Speaker 5:  pedometer kind of thing. And I think

1027
01:03:52,665 --> 01:03:55,765
Speaker 5:  in practice it's quite hard to do because

1028
01:03:57,425 --> 01:04:01,365
Speaker 5:  people we found don't really like to be interrupted with like

1029
01:04:01,365 --> 01:04:05,045
Speaker 5:  gameplay and story. It, it, it's kind of annoying and, and so

1030
01:04:05,545 --> 01:04:09,165
Speaker 5:  the issue is that like third party developers generally do not have enough

1031
01:04:09,175 --> 01:04:12,445
Speaker 5:  contextual information about like what the person is doing

1032
01:04:12,985 --> 01:04:16,485
Speaker 5:  to like make sure that the interruptions work. But of course you want to

1033
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:20,125
Speaker 5:  interrupt people. Like if you are like a line goes up business person, so,

1034
01:04:20,145 --> 01:04:24,005
Speaker 5:  so, but then that usually gets too annoying. So we did

1035
01:04:24,105 --> 01:04:27,805
Speaker 5:  try and and make like two or three times to go and make these these games

1036
01:04:27,805 --> 01:04:31,685
Speaker 5:  which would be kind of ambient. And I think at the point

1037
01:04:31,985 --> 01:04:35,965
Speaker 5:  at which using AI or using just more sensors, devs

1038
01:04:36,275 --> 01:04:40,045
Speaker 5:  have that ability then you will see more of that stuff and I think it will

1039
01:04:40,285 --> 01:04:43,325
Speaker 5:  actually end up looking really interesting and looking more

1040
01:04:44,065 --> 01:04:47,525
Speaker 5:  almost like role playing, right? It'll be like an even richer experience

1041
01:04:47,745 --> 01:04:51,485
Speaker 5:  and I know that people actually want to play these sorts of games where they're

1042
01:04:51,485 --> 01:04:54,965
Speaker 5:  kind of more into it at the same time. I think people probably be a little

1043
01:04:54,965 --> 01:04:58,245
Speaker 5:  bit like nervous about what that means. 'cause you know that if it's really

1044
01:04:58,245 --> 01:05:01,805
Speaker 5:  good it just actually takes over your life, right? And so do people really

1045
01:05:01,805 --> 01:05:03,765
Speaker 5:  want that just to get fit? I don't know.

1046
01:05:04,585 --> 01:05:08,165
Speaker 2:  As you look around this space right now, do you see any other things that,

1047
01:05:08,165 --> 01:05:12,045
Speaker 2:  that feel kind of spiritually similar to Zombie's Run? I think about

1048
01:05:12,045 --> 01:05:15,445
Speaker 2:  like we, we've all at the Virgin using this app called Stompers, which is

1049
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:19,165
Speaker 2:  basically, it's like a, it's a sort of silly pedometer game and I think it

1050
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:23,045
Speaker 2:  has hooked a lot of people in the same way that it's, it's not

1051
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:26,925
Speaker 2:  even accurate, but being accurate is not the point. Like do you, do you

1052
01:05:26,925 --> 01:05:30,205
Speaker 2:  see anything that feels like it's sort of doing the same thing that the a

1053
01:05:30,205 --> 01:05:30,725
Speaker 2:  similar way,

1054
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:35,605
Speaker 5:  I mean like one of the other things which I know vis written about w was

1055
01:05:35,605 --> 01:05:39,325
Speaker 5:  a whole fantasy hike thing where oh, and, and like, you know, and and like

1056
01:05:39,325 --> 01:05:42,885
Speaker 5:  before that it, it was just a direct rip off, you know, Lord of the Rings

1057
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:46,805
Speaker 5:  where you're like walking from the Shire to like Moreor and I think

1058
01:05:47,045 --> 01:05:49,925
Speaker 5:  actually at the start you would just type in like how far you'd walked into

1059
01:05:49,925 --> 01:05:53,205
Speaker 5:  like a webpage and then it work it out and it got slowly more, more interesting

1060
01:05:53,345 --> 01:05:56,965
Speaker 5:  and that's cool. Like that's a fun thing. People have done various things

1061
01:05:56,965 --> 01:06:00,925
Speaker 5:  like that. There's a, a website or or an app called The Beautiful

1062
01:06:00,955 --> 01:06:04,165
Speaker 5:  Walk, which was kind of synced up to, to your,

1063
01:06:04,745 --> 01:06:08,205
Speaker 5:  you know, fitness apps and, and would do that like spiritually,

1064
01:06:08,795 --> 01:06:12,525
Speaker 5:  like a lot of the VR staff and ar stuff I

1065
01:06:12,805 --> 01:06:16,565
Speaker 5:  think is interesting in the sense of, you know, I

1066
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:20,725
Speaker 5:  I come back to I want people to be having fun when they exercise. And

1067
01:06:20,725 --> 01:06:24,245
Speaker 5:  so I used to play like Hollow Point a lot,

1068
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:25,885
Speaker 5:  which was this old

1069
01:06:27,415 --> 01:06:30,765
Speaker 5:  steam like five game and it was like an archery game

1070
01:06:31,265 --> 01:06:35,125
Speaker 5:  and basically you, you were just shooting, you're just using at, you know,

1071
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:38,805
Speaker 5:  enemies in virtual reality, you know, arena with archery.

1072
01:06:39,465 --> 01:06:43,325
Speaker 5:  And the core thing was because the arrows

1073
01:06:43,325 --> 01:06:47,205
Speaker 5:  kind of like move slowly then you could dodge them. Like you can't dodge

1074
01:06:47,205 --> 01:06:50,645
Speaker 5:  bullets in real life, right? But like in super hot with other games you You

1075
01:06:50,645 --> 01:06:53,845
Speaker 5:  can dodge these and so you're always just like rolling around the floor and

1076
01:06:53,845 --> 01:06:57,685
Speaker 5:  jumping up and down and, and like it's just so energetic in a way

1077
01:06:57,685 --> 01:07:00,605
Speaker 5:  that like you could never get me to do that in real life. Like if you told

1078
01:07:00,605 --> 01:07:04,245
Speaker 5:  me, okay, go and go and fall over sideways and then go and scramble and roll

1079
01:07:04,245 --> 01:07:07,685
Speaker 5:  back and jump up. It's like I, no, I'm not doing that. But like you go and

1080
01:07:07,925 --> 01:07:11,645
Speaker 5:  put me in VR and there's like arrows coming at me and I'm like shooting people

1081
01:07:11,645 --> 01:07:15,565
Speaker 5:  of arrows. I'm like, this is the most fun I've ever had, but I don't

1082
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:19,165
Speaker 5:  have room for it so I can't play that anymore. So that's kind of the problem,

1083
01:07:19,315 --> 01:07:23,085
Speaker 5:  like what I, I think and I, and I do see like the, you know, beat Saber

1084
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:27,045
Speaker 5:  and Fit XR and things like that and I'm like, seems a bit boring

1085
01:07:27,105 --> 01:07:30,405
Speaker 5:  to me, you know, I want something a bit more involved than that. So

1086
01:07:30,405 --> 01:07:32,045
Speaker 2:  First of all, how dare you? Super

1087
01:07:32,045 --> 01:07:32,485
Speaker 5:  Is amazing.

1088
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:37,125
Speaker 2:  Yes. This is, that's that was outrageous. But no, I I I'm glad you actually

1089
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:39,525
Speaker 2:  mentioned super hot because Super Hot is one of those games that I found

1090
01:07:39,525 --> 01:07:43,445
Speaker 2:  to be like accidentally a surprisingly good workout. It's

1091
01:07:43,445 --> 01:07:46,565
Speaker 2:  like time only moves when you do. So I'm doing a ton of like very

1092
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:50,685
Speaker 2:  deliberate, intense movement and I'm like, I'm sweating at the end and it's

1093
01:07:50,685 --> 01:07:53,485
Speaker 2:  like, all right, this is what I'm going for. This is like a fun thing that

1094
01:07:53,515 --> 01:07:57,125
Speaker 2:  made me sweat. Not a thing that bullied me into exercising,

1095
01:07:57,445 --> 01:07:58,525
Speaker 2:  which feels very different

1096
01:07:58,925 --> 01:08:01,885
Speaker 5:  I think when we get the glasses, you know, which we all want and not the

1097
01:08:01,885 --> 01:08:05,485
Speaker 5:  head, you know, the the VR headset, this is gonna be the way people exercise.

1098
01:08:05,595 --> 01:08:09,525
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be amazing. Like it's so cool but like it's just not there

1099
01:08:09,525 --> 01:08:13,445
Speaker 5:  at the moment. Like it's just too like, I don't know, it's like sweaty, like

1100
01:08:13,645 --> 01:08:17,485
Speaker 5:  I know people do use these things, but it, it's, it's for like for

1101
01:08:17,485 --> 01:08:20,925
Speaker 5:  most people it's it, you know, it doesn't seem to be a good experience. So

1102
01:08:21,845 --> 01:08:24,725
Speaker 5:  I think that's gonna be great. I think, you know, make believe and like role

1103
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:27,925
Speaker 5:  play and sports, like that's one of the best ways of getting fit.

1104
01:08:28,725 --> 01:08:32,445
Speaker 6:  I think giving my per self permission to do the fantasy stuff, fantasy hike

1105
01:08:32,465 --> 01:08:35,805
Speaker 6:  to whack my editors with baseball bats and Stompers

1106
01:08:36,505 --> 01:08:40,285
Speaker 6:  has really just kind of made it easier to be like, oh

1107
01:08:40,315 --> 01:08:44,125
Speaker 6:  it's okay if I'm not so fast. It's okay, you know what, just give

1108
01:08:44,325 --> 01:08:48,165
Speaker 6:  yourself the participation trophy. That's the only real badge that you need.

1109
01:08:48,315 --> 01:08:51,965
Speaker 6:  It's okay, maybe it's 'cause I'm a millennial, but the participation trophy

1110
01:08:52,185 --> 01:08:52,805
Speaker 6:  is good enough.

1111
01:08:53,355 --> 01:08:57,205
Speaker 5:  Well it, I mean, you know, the way we put it in Zombies Run is as

1112
01:08:57,205 --> 01:09:00,405
Speaker 5:  long as You can boo faster than a slow shamble, then you know you're good

1113
01:09:00,405 --> 01:09:04,245
Speaker 5:  with us. So keep on trying things until you find

1114
01:09:04,245 --> 01:09:06,325
Speaker 5:  something that's fun and, and if it's

1115
01:11:24,385 --> 01:11:28,045
Speaker 7:  an advantage to having a handheld over that situation if I've already got

1116
01:11:28,045 --> 01:11:31,645
Speaker 7:  something like a game pass subscription? Thanks, appreciate it.

1117
01:11:31,945 --> 01:11:32,165
Speaker 7:  Bye.

1118
01:11:32,765 --> 01:11:35,245
Speaker 2:  I should say by the way, before we get started, thank you to everybody who

1119
01:11:35,245 --> 01:11:39,085
Speaker 2:  responded about our segment last week about gaming handhelds. I got

1120
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:42,125
Speaker 2:  a ton of good ideas from people. I got a lot of people who just like felt

1121
01:11:42,185 --> 01:11:46,165
Speaker 2:  my pain about wanting to play FIFA and

1122
01:11:46,305 --> 01:11:50,085
Speaker 2:  not having a good device to do it on. People are mad at ea, I'm also mad

1123
01:11:50,085 --> 01:11:53,885
Speaker 2:  at ea thank you to everybody who reached out. I have a lot of gadgets to

1124
01:11:53,885 --> 01:11:57,285
Speaker 2:  try. I haven't bought anything yet, but I'm committed to answering this question

1125
01:11:57,305 --> 01:12:01,285
Speaker 2:  for real at some point very soon and I'll get back in touch. But thank you

1126
01:12:01,285 --> 01:12:04,365
Speaker 2:  to everybody who reached out with suggestions and ideas and commiseration,

1127
01:12:04,805 --> 01:12:08,525
Speaker 2:  I appreciate it. My answer for this question is actually

1128
01:12:08,765 --> 01:12:12,525
Speaker 2:  pretty simple. I just went through this recently and I

1129
01:12:12,715 --> 01:12:16,645
Speaker 2:  initially, I just went through this recently. My kid is about a year and

1130
01:12:16,645 --> 01:12:20,085
Speaker 2:  a half old at the beginning of 2023. I was in that like

1131
01:12:20,515 --> 01:12:23,565
Speaker 2:  sitting up at night for four hours while a small child

1132
01:12:24,145 --> 01:12:28,005
Speaker 2:  sleeps on my lap vibes and you're like, what do I do with myself? I tried

1133
01:12:28,005 --> 01:12:31,925
Speaker 2:  all the things for a while. I was carrying a switch around with me that

1134
01:12:31,965 --> 01:12:35,885
Speaker 2:  I would use in those moments. I had a couple of like tester

1135
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:39,725
Speaker 2:  things. I got one of the slightly sketchy things from

1136
01:12:39,825 --> 01:12:43,125
Speaker 2:  Amazon that You can buy that have a million retro games on them.

1137
01:12:44,005 --> 01:12:47,885
Speaker 2:  I think the answer is just your phone. And I

1138
01:12:47,885 --> 01:12:51,085
Speaker 2:  think this for a couple of reasons. One, and this is the key one,

1139
01:12:51,795 --> 01:12:55,045
Speaker 2:  your phone is just there with you all the time. One of the things that happens

1140
01:12:55,075 --> 01:12:58,925
Speaker 2:  when you're a new parent is that you just suddenly find yourself frozen to

1141
01:12:58,965 --> 01:13:02,605
Speaker 2:  a place because your child just fell asleep. And You can

1142
01:13:02,915 --> 01:13:06,165
Speaker 2:  plan ahead to some extent and say like, okay, I'm gonna leave the switch

1143
01:13:06,305 --> 01:13:10,005
Speaker 2:  in the room with the chair where I'm probably gonna be while the kid is sleeping

1144
01:13:10,105 --> 01:13:13,965
Speaker 2:  or whatever. But your phone is just dramatically more likely

1145
01:13:14,065 --> 01:13:17,885
Speaker 2:  to be in your pocket, right? and it also has a lot

1146
01:13:17,885 --> 01:13:21,045
Speaker 2:  of retro games now especially, which are really great to play

1147
01:13:22,005 --> 01:13:25,925
Speaker 2:  A on silent and B for a couple of minutes at a time. When you're in those

1148
01:13:25,925 --> 01:13:28,445
Speaker 2:  moments where you're like, I don't know how long I'm gonna have to do this.

1149
01:13:28,985 --> 01:13:32,725
Speaker 2:  You can just quickly fire up Delta or one of the other emulators. And I

1150
01:13:32,725 --> 01:13:36,445
Speaker 2:  played, I would say maybe an alarming amount of like

1151
01:13:36,505 --> 01:13:40,205
Speaker 2:  old Mario games, a few minutes at a time with one thumb on

1152
01:13:40,345 --> 01:13:44,285
Speaker 2:  the joystick and one thumb on the buttons kind of wrapped

1153
01:13:44,385 --> 01:13:47,925
Speaker 2:  my arms around the, it was, it's, it's a, it's a scene but it works.

1154
01:13:48,545 --> 01:13:52,205
Speaker 2:  The other thing is it's really malleable, which I like, right? So I have

1155
01:13:52,205 --> 01:13:56,045
Speaker 2:  a backbone controller, which I like very much and when I was able to

1156
01:13:56,155 --> 01:14:00,125
Speaker 2:  sort of plan for it, I would use the backbone, I would bring the backbone

1157
01:14:00,125 --> 01:14:03,325
Speaker 2:  with me, I would plug it in, I would have the full better controller. And

1158
01:14:03,325 --> 01:14:07,205
Speaker 2:  that worked great. Works really well with a lot of games on

1159
01:14:07,545 --> 01:14:11,445
Speaker 2:  iOS and Android. Highly recommend a backbone as a sort of addition

1160
01:14:11,445 --> 01:14:15,325
Speaker 2:  to all of this. But when you don't have that, You can just use your phone,

1161
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:18,845
Speaker 2:  right? And so having something that you're not stuck

1162
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:21,845
Speaker 2:  because you forgot one piece of it is really helpful.

1163
01:14:22,745 --> 01:14:26,445
Speaker 2:  The other piece of it is that you will find yourself needing your phone for

1164
01:14:26,585 --> 01:14:30,485
Speaker 2:  all kinds of other things, right? Maybe you're gonna be one of those parents

1165
01:14:30,795 --> 01:14:34,685
Speaker 2:  like I was who has a spreadsheet of like every time your kid eats and sleeps

1166
01:14:34,685 --> 01:14:38,605
Speaker 2:  and goes to the bathroom and having that with you at the same time

1167
01:14:38,605 --> 01:14:41,965
Speaker 2:  that you have your like thing you wanna play games on. Super helpful.

1168
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:46,285
Speaker 2:  If you are the type of parent who is going to be like texting your partner

1169
01:14:46,385 --> 01:14:50,205
Speaker 2:  or taking lots of pictures or whatever, again your phone just

1170
01:14:50,205 --> 01:14:54,045
Speaker 2:  becomes like the center of your baby universe in a very real way. And

1171
01:14:54,065 --> 01:14:58,005
Speaker 2:  so not adding another device to the equation is

1172
01:14:58,005 --> 01:15:01,965
Speaker 2:  sort of useful. There are good reasons to get a dedicated

1173
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:05,245
Speaker 2:  device. Like I've, I've talked to a lot of people who bought a switch,

1174
01:15:06,265 --> 01:15:10,085
Speaker 2:  put like Zelda on it and then left it in the baby's room

1175
01:15:10,265 --> 01:15:13,725
Speaker 2:  and that becomes the like I am in the baby's room, this is the thing I'm

1176
01:15:13,725 --> 01:15:17,645
Speaker 2:  gonna play. There's something to that. But I think for me having fewer

1177
01:15:18,005 --> 01:15:21,125
Speaker 2:  batteries to worry about having the thing that's probably in my pocket be

1178
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:24,445
Speaker 2:  the thing that works and having kind of the one device to rule them all

1179
01:15:25,135 --> 01:15:28,765
Speaker 2:  wound up being really helpful. Also, there are

1180
01:15:29,085 --> 01:15:32,205
Speaker 2:  a lot of games that I played that I would call like deeply

1181
01:15:33,145 --> 01:15:37,085
Speaker 2:  boring, repetitive games that are actually perfect for mobile. 'cause

1182
01:15:37,085 --> 01:15:39,725
Speaker 2:  you're in this headspace when you have a newborn where you're just exhausted

1183
01:15:39,945 --> 01:15:42,885
Speaker 2:  and you're like, okay, I wanna play a game. I don't wanna use my brain at

1184
01:15:42,885 --> 01:15:46,005
Speaker 2:  all and I'm gonna need to play this game for somewhere between one minute

1185
01:15:46,025 --> 01:15:50,005
Speaker 2:  and five hours. Games like hole down, which is basically a, it's, it's

1186
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:53,645
Speaker 2:  like reverse snoo. You shoot a ball downward and you try to

1187
01:15:53,865 --> 01:15:56,965
Speaker 2:  remove all the stuff down at the bottom and the further you go down, the

1188
01:15:56,965 --> 01:16:00,405
Speaker 2:  more points you get endlessly repeatable games. I

1189
01:16:00,845 --> 01:16:04,645
Speaker 2:  probably played a hundred hours of that game and it's a perfect little mobile

1190
01:16:04,645 --> 01:16:08,485
Speaker 2:  game. You can play it with one hand, which is another victory given

1191
01:16:08,905 --> 01:16:12,045
Speaker 2:  baby's sleep situations. Having something You can do with one hand is pretty

1192
01:16:12,045 --> 01:16:15,885
Speaker 2:  helpful. I did a lot of like cross wordy kinds of

1193
01:16:15,885 --> 01:16:19,205
Speaker 2:  things when I was like, okay, I actually need to use my brain a little bit.

1194
01:16:19,805 --> 01:16:23,365
Speaker 2:  I did a lot of those like Temple

1195
01:16:23,665 --> 01:16:27,325
Speaker 2:  Run kind of endless runner games because again, super easy, super

1196
01:16:27,565 --> 01:16:31,285
Speaker 2:  repetitive, doesn't require any brain power. Those are the kinds of games

1197
01:16:31,395 --> 01:16:35,045
Speaker 2:  that I ended up playing way more than I expected. I was like, oh, I'm gonna

1198
01:16:35,045 --> 01:16:38,685
Speaker 2:  play a lot of like fun old PS two

1199
01:16:38,695 --> 01:16:41,925
Speaker 2:  games because now I have all this time to kill and I ended up playing like

1200
01:16:42,285 --> 01:16:46,085
Speaker 2:  infinite hours of hold down because it's just what happens in those

1201
01:16:46,085 --> 01:16:49,565
Speaker 2:  moments. You're tired, you have one hand des spare while there's a human

1202
01:16:50,085 --> 01:16:53,885
Speaker 2:  sleeping on top of you and that just is what it's, so I think the

1203
01:16:53,885 --> 01:16:57,485
Speaker 2:  answer is probably either a switch for the games or

1204
01:16:57,835 --> 01:17:01,765
Speaker 2:  your phone with a backbone or some other kind of controller. But

1205
01:17:01,805 --> 01:17:05,365
Speaker 2:  I would, I would start with your phone because there's a lot of games. It's

1206
01:17:05,365 --> 01:17:09,205
Speaker 2:  super easy, it's super accessible and odds are it's gonna be right there

1207
01:17:09,315 --> 01:17:13,245
Speaker 2:  with you, which is pretty important. I hope that helps. Let me know. And

1208
01:17:13,245 --> 01:17:17,005
Speaker 2:  again, I've gotten tons of really good handheld recommendations over the

1209
01:17:17,005 --> 01:17:20,445
Speaker 2:  last couple of weeks. And, if you have good ones for me or for Keaton here,
